the Democrats continue to be as stupid as they possibly can a Democratic candidate has now run one of the most painful and yet hilarious campaign ads in history the Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives in Colorado's name is Levi Tillman he's run against Jason crow he says that he says that the best way to stop school shootings is to armed schools and teachers with pepper spray and in his campaign ad he sprays himself with pepper spray to show how effective this strategy would be I'm calling on Congress to stop talking past each other and try something new empower schools and teachers with non-lethal self-defense tools like this can of pepper spray trust me this will stop anyone in their tracks and then he sprays himself in the eyes with pepper spray and then he has to dunk his head in gas of chemicals to stop it and then he describes how terrible is there's more than 300 million guns in the United States as this guy's now soaked in soap and now he's running a hose over his eyes non-lethal school defense is part of the solution I hope the Democrats continue to run on these platforms forever and never stop doing it all Democrats please spray pepper spray in your eyes to own the own the cons my goodness gracious so never problems we're having inside the Republican Party at least we're not spraying ourselves in the face with pepper spray in or demonstrate that our agenda is apparently superior and well done Rando Colorado Democrat oh my goodness suck I mean it's almost literally cutting off your nose to spite your face it's literally blinding yourself in order to demonstrate that President Trump is wrong about guns well just pretty amazing stuff
