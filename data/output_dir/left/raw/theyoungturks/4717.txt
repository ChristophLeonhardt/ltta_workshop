1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,130
A RADIO
TALKSHOW HOST IN PENNSYLVANIA

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,660
HAS APPARENTLY JUST RECENTLY
QUIT HIS JOB AFTER BEING TOLD BY

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,700
MANAGEMENT HE IS NOT ALLOWED TO

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,169
CRITICIZE DONALD TRUMP.

5
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:19,960
HE PUT
OUT 

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:31,869
THIS STATEMENT.

7
00:00:31,869 --> 00:00:32,869
LET'S BRING

8
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:36,380
UP THE EMAIL THAT TRIGGERED
THIS.

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:43,090
>> LET'S BREAK THIS DOWN.

10
00:00:43,090 --> 00:01:00,739
I
WORKED IN RADIO A LITTLE BIT, IN

11
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:10,480
FACT WE ARE 
BACK ON SIRIUS

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,979
DOING RADIO NOW.

13
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,840
>>ARE
WE ALLOWED TO CRITICIZE TRUMP?

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,180
>>I'M PRETTY SURE WE ARE.

15
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:24,040
WE CAN
CRITICIZE ANYONE WE LIKE.

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,740
IT 
WAS

17
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,680
REALLY HARD TO GET ON STATIONS.

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,140
WE DO HAVE AN HONEST PROGRAM

19
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,869
DIRECTOR IN MINNESOTA WHO SAID
ALMOST EVERY STATION BACK THEN

20
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:42,270
WAS CONSERVATIVE TALK.

21
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,500
IF I PUT
YOU ON, THE REST OF THE AUDIENCE

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,131
WILL BE UPSET BECAUSE ALL THE

23
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,780
OTHER SHOWS ARE CONSERVATIVE.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,759
AND I SAID SO ARE THERE ANY

25
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,500
PROGRESSIVE CHANNELS IN
MINNESOTA?

26
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,159
HE SAID I DON'T THINK

27
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,640
THERE ARE MANY PROGRESSIVE

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,200
CHANNELS PERIOD.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,050
AT THE TIME
THERE WASN'T. IF YOU ARE AT

30
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:14,640
WTPA AND YOU ARE ON THE LEFT AND
HONEST, YOU WILL BE OUT OF LUCK

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,580
AND OUT OF A JOB.

32
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,630
IN LA IF YOU
ARE NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO THE

33
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,180
PRESIDENT YOU WILL BE SHUNNED.

34
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,340
AND THERE THEY ARE LIKE OH MY

35
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,400
GOD HOW DARE YOU CRITICIZE
DONALD TRUMP.

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
WHAT?

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,360
>>IN THE BATHROOM WE HAVE A
CLASSICAL MUSIC STATION ON, THEY

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:47,730
CALL TRUMP AN A-HOLE.

39
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,700
I'M

40
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,690
KIDDING.

41
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,580
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS
IT IS POSSIBLE THIS PERSON WAS

42
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,350
THE REASON FOR THAT LETTER.

43
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,890
BUT
IT COULD POTENTIALLY GO EVEN

44
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,270
HIGHER THAN THAT.

45
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:20,580
IT 
SOUNDS RIDICULOUS SO WE HAD

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,120
TO GO AND FIND THAT SONG AND

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,350
WE WILL PLAY A LITTLE BIT FOR
YOU RIGHT NOW.

48
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:31,170
>> I'M VOTING FOR DONALD FOR
PRESIDENT.

49
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,060
I'M VOTING FOR DONALD

50
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,850
FOR PRESIDENT, HE'LL MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

51
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,400
>> YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING ABOUT
PENNSYLVANIA?

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,650
IN BETWEEN PHILLY

53
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,370
AND PITTSBURGH THERE IS ALABAMA.

54
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,540
>>NOTHING AGAINST ALABAMA.

55
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,680
SO
YEAH, A GUY WHO LOVES DONALD

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
TRUMP SO MUCH HE IS WILLING TO

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,910
WRITE AND THEN RECORD, AND THEN
RELEASE WHAT YOU JUST LISTEN TO

58
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,380
単 THAT IS A ZEALOT AND IT'S
POSSIBLE HE IS PUTTING A LOT OF

59
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:17,190
PRESSURE ON THE MANAGER OF
THIS NETWORK.

60
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,738
>> AGAIN TO BE FAIR TO THE
RIGHT, IT'S NOT LIKE IT DOESN'T

61
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,439
HAPPEN ON THE LEFT.

62
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,250
WHEN I WAS
IN MSNBC THEY WERE NOT HAPPY

63
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,850
WHEN I WAS DISRESPECTFUL TO THE
PRESIDENT BACK WHEN WE HAD A

64
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,840
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,770
ONE
INSTANCE WAS WHEN OBAMA GAVE A

66
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:37,540
SPEECH ABOUT THE EGYPTIAN
REVOLUTION, RIGHT AFTERWARDS I

67
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,180
SAID I WILL KEEP IT REAL AND I
SAID HE WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

68
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,470
AND I GOT A STERN TALKING TO BUY
A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE COMPANY

69
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,040
ABOUT HOW THAT WAS DISRESPECTFUL

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
TO THE PRESIDENT.

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,910
BECAUSE THEY
SAID YOU SAID IT RIGHT AFTER HIS

72
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,910
SPEECH.

73
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:58,020
I SAID WOULD IT BE MORE
RESPECTFUL IF I SAID IT A WEEK

74
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
LATER?

75
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:04,300
THEY ARE NOT THE ONLY
ONES GUILTY OF IT, BUT IN THIS

76
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,110
CASE IT IS A CONSERVATIVE 単 THE
KIND OF PARTLY MISS UNDERSTAND

77
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,260
THE POINT OF THE FIRST

78
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,260
AMENDMENT.

79
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,770
BUT IT IS HIS STATION
AND HE GETS TO DO WHAT HE WANTS

80
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,600
WITH IT.

81
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,820
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

82
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:39,720
IF
YOU ARE IN THAT NECK OF 

83
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
THE

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,979
WOODS, I GUESS IT MAKES SENSE.

85
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:57,250
>> THIS MADE ME REMEMBER 単 I
REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT A

86
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:03,370
CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST TO SAID
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE AUDIENCE

87
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:10,250
WANTS 100% LOYALTY TO DONALD
TRUMP.

88
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,360
IT LED TO HIM STOPPING

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
THE SHOW.

90
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,240
IT WAS EITHER RADIO OR
ONLINE.

91
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
THE AMOUNT OF

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,810
INTOLERANCE 単 WE LIKE TO IMAGINE
THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING MORE

93
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,810
OPEN-MINDED.

94
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,590
EVERYONE SAYS THEY
ARE CRITICAL THINKERS AND THEY

95
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,680
LIKE THE REVIEWS BEING
CHALLENGED.

96
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,960
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

97
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,150
WANT TO HEAR EXACTLY WHAT THEY
BELIEVE WITHOUT STRAYING AN INCH

98
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,280
FROM THAT.

99
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,389
AND IT CAN AFFECT YOU.

100
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,210
>> WHEN PEOPLE SAY THEY LIKE
CRITICAL THINKERS WHO CHALLENGE

101
00:06:43,210 --> 00:00:00,000
OTHER PEOPLE'S IDEAS THEY MEAN
YOUR IDEAS NOT MY IDEAS.
