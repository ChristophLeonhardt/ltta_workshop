he's back former President Barack Obama wading into midterm politics now after spending most of his post-presidency largely steering clear of politics that's ending on Wednesday the former president and first lady Michelle Obama released a list of 81 Democrats they're endorsing ahead of this year's midterms notable endorsements include Georgia governor candidate Stacey Abrams Nevada Senate candidate Jackie Rosen New Mexico congressional candidate Deb Holland but there's also a lot of buzz today about notable absences Texas Senate candidate bata O'Rourke and New York congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortes not on this first list of endorsements Flynn sweet is Washington bureau chief for the Chicago sun-times Jonathan Allen national political reporter for NBC News digital great to see both of you here's what you wrote Lynne quote a Democrat endorsing a Democratic nominee is routine what the Obama List signifies is who Obama is going to do something to help in advance of the November midterms so what's your take on this list as it stands well it includes kind of categories of people but the most important category is that Obama has gone to some lengths Chris and John to avoid being a divisive figure within the struggling Democratic Party as it tries to figure out its own future course and the fill meaning the mainstream for lack of the bigger were better word Democrats and the Socialists more Bernie Sanders wing that fight he's not going to find himself in the middle of it right and he has most of the people on the 81 names listed have already been come the nominees they are ready to endorse II so there's no controversy there and some of the names you mentioned right now they'll he just has the easy out of saying well this is just the first batch Eric Shaw's spokesman told me there'll be other batches so they try to minimize it which I think right now is true because he wants to go where he's helpful the point is to win seats governorships and state legislative bodies so in that case so dumbs can he have a big hand and laughter the 2020 census do we assume he's helpful though Jonathan I mean one of the things that that I always think about is I followed most of his appearances for Hillary Clinton and in many of the places where he went as I went down the line and talked to people the majority of people were there to see in person and historic president they were not there to back Hillary Clinton now obviously he can raise a lot of money he's great at that but will going out and being on the campaign trail do you think help individual candidates will it get people to the polls it could it couldn't get some people to Paul certainly could rally the base Democratic voters still hold President Obama in high regard that said there is limited utility and value to endorsements you're not able to as President Obama say you're endorsing a candidate and you know suddenly you know hundreds of thousands of people come out of the woodwork to vote for them I would say in looking at this list and there were some other notable omissions and it gets to this point of who is he going to help you didn't have Joe Donnelly the senator from Indiana you didn't have senator tester from Montana to Senator Manchin from West Virginia senator McCaskill from Missouri or senator Heitkamp from North Dakota those are the Republic the Democratic incumbents in the most competitive races in the country and also running in states that a Republican obviously Barack Obama doesn't carry the same weight there that he does in some of the more democratic areas and of course he also made some endorsements of people who had helped him in the past that are you know in in marginal races in places that are more likely to go Democratic Tom Malinowski in New Jersey is a good example that had worked at the State Department under Obama Ben Rhodes who of course is the former deputy national security adviser and arguably spent as much if not more time than almost anybody else in the Obama White House with the President and still he just got back from being with him in Kenya where he he did the big speech for Nelson Mandela's birthday with on Morning Joe this morning and he talked about the challenge facing Barack Obama let me play that for you part of the problem that we had the last eight years is it not enough leaders emerged Obama took up a lot of space in the Clinton took up a lot of space and I think part of his calculus is look if I'm out there every day having this fight I'm gonna take up all the space that we need new leaders to step into right so it's that balance of how do i how do I not be this guy who's who's owning the fields here I'm doing my part and I'm telling my part of the story here but I want to make sure that we get some new blood up that a guy how much of a balancing act do you think this is for Obama well first of all Ben Rhodes still works for Obama he's a member of his post presidential staff and that is what he was he was talking about one of the pillars of the Obama presidency is to grow the leadership that he didn't grow when he was in the White House for eight years let's look at it that way Democrats lost seats state level local level national level all during it which is interesting it goes way down ballot it goes to legislative seats and that's because of the redistricting battles ahead after the 2020 census president so if one part of post Obama presidency is growing young leaders and around the world another one is to join with his Attorney General Eric Holder his first Attorney General in this redistricting organization that they're involved in to try and and get these state legislators and governors and also the other bucket on this list of 81 it's you and John know are some 20 candidates who are just alumni of the Obama White House or of his campaigns so so what do you think real quickly here Jonathan Allen I mean he's not gonna go out there and say Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump that's just not who he is or what he's going to do but what will his message be well I think his message to Democrats is going to be that they've got to show show up so that they can you know first counter the Trump policies and they may not use the president's name maybe it will but first to counter them and then to start moving in a more democratic general direction Barak Obama left the Democratic Party with its you know smallest footprint in this country in history in terms of legislative seats in Congress and the presidency having flipped to Republicans and that's not necessarily a reflection on the American public's feelings about him but certainly the reaction in some cases to his policies and the inability of that's beyond him to to win elections yeah I also wonder if just him showing up just him being there being Barack Obama doesn't send a message to the base remember what a different kind of presidency look like and if that's not motivating just in and of itself we shall see hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
