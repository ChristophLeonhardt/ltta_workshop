President Trump talked about pardons today in a way that no other president ever has sometimes in the past presidents have been asked about some highly publicized cases in which a person was applying for a pardon but never have we heard a president simply talk about people he is thinking about maybe pardoning without even getting a question about it from anyone and without getting a request from that person for a pardon when the president volunteered today on Air Force One that he is thinking about commuting the prison sentence of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich the president lied he said that Blagojevich did nothing wrong when he got caught on tape trying to sell the appointment to Senator Barack Obama's Senate seat after Barack Obama was elected president of the United States that is a classic case of bribery but today the president said that all politicians do that there was nothing to it and that blew Goya vich saying he wanted to sell the seven-seat was just quote a stupid thing to say he also said he was thinking about pardoning Martha Stewart who was convicted of lying to the FBI and he announced that he already decided to pardon dinesh d'souza for violating campaign finance laws it seems the president is sitting around the Oval Office trying to find people to pardon who were convicted of the kinds of offenses that Donald Trump's campaign friends and campaign staff and others near Donald Trump just might be charged with joining our discussion now Lawrence tribe Harvard Law School professor and co-author of the new book to end a presidency the power of impeachment professor tribe thank you very much for joining us tonight I want to get your reaction to what the president revealed today about his use of the pardon power well I think he made absolutely clear that he's using it to protect the rich and famous and the people who do the very kinds of things that he seems to think aren't so bad and that the people around him have done obstruct justice lie to the federal authorities manipulate the election system cheat basically undermine the American government I mean the big first pardon that he gave to our pile the first time he was sort of dangling the get-out-of-jail-free card to people like manna fort and and you know Mike Flynn and all these other guys it was pardoning someone for defying a judicial order that he stopped mistreating and discriminating against immigrants of color I mean first of all using the pardon to basically undermine the ability of courts to enforce the law when you claim to be a law and order candidate turns the world upside down so he's sending as I think Maya and Matt and David corn all indicated he's sending all the wrong signals he's sending signals to the people who have damning evidence about him that if they just stay strong he'll have their back or he might he's sending signals to the country into his base that people like conspiracy theorists like Dinesh D'Souza are doing the right thing that they are really on the right side of the law I mean D'Souza is a great example he's somebody who was fairly prosecuted he pled guilty he realized he basically admitted in open court that he had deliberately manipulated the election system to evade the limits on how much you can contribute he had done that and all he was given was five years of probation with one measly day a week of public service I mean that was a light sentence and now suddenly were supposed to sympathize with him the pardon power was never meant to rip the system of law apart it's it's totally ghastly the Washington Post is carrying a report tonight quoting Roger stone as saying basically what you've just said about the pardon of dinesh d'souza this is what Roger stone says tonight in the Washington Post about the pardon dinesh d'souza he says it has to be a signal to Mike Flynn and Paul Manafort and even Robert s smaller the third indict people for crimes that don't pertain to Russian collusion and this is what could happen the special council has awesome powers as you know but the president has even more awesome powers so there's Roger stone translating the the pardon for us well he got the signal although I wouldn't say that there's any exception for Russian collusion I mean this is a very strong signal to everybody who's being investigated by the Southern District of New York or by robert muller that if they just don't hurt the president he will protect them it's it's a terrible message to send and even though the pardon power itself is very broad when pardons are used as part of a conspiracy or a scheme to obstruct justice and take down the legal system they can form a pattern of impeachable offenses that is what we're saying now your former colleague Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz says that anything that is a presidential power whenever it's exercised by the president by definition you can't possibly impeach the president for that you you to have a sharp disagreement over this for example in the pardon power professor Dershowitz would hold that the president has the authority to do a pardon in the Constitution therefore any use of the pardon power is justifiable and cannot be an impeachable offense I don't know what planet my former colleague is on but he's got it absolutely upside-down and inside-out the whole point of the impeachment power which has to be used with great care but the whole point of it is to prevent the gross and dangerous abuse of the very powers the president has if for example Donald Trump is guilty even now of tax evasion which does not involve using a presidential power he can't be impeached for that but if he uses the powers that he has like the power to fire the FBI director but for corrupt purposes that's the whole point of the pardon power it's just completely crazy to say that when you abuse your powers then you can't be removed from office I mean that's what's true of a king a queen an emperor but not of the head of the American government that's not what America is all about nobody here is above the law Harvard Law School professor Lawrence tribe author of to end a presidency thank
