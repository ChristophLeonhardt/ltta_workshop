1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's 842 morning on the fourteenth</font>

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,029
of november i got into<font color="#CCCCCC"> brooklyn last</font>

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:08,010
night with<font color="#CCCCCC"> john i'm in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> afternoon</font>

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,639
rather and we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the pub to watch</font>

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,160
the end of the bosnia island game which

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,180
was being played entirely<font color="#CCCCCC"> in frog and</font>

7
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,080
literally looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,189
ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I've never seen because</font>

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the folk was everywhere and the Irish</font>

10
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,850
players were wearing these green shorts

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,750
and he couldn't really see anything

12
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,460
other than like their knees and their

13
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,689
shirt certainly couldn't see the ball

14
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:29,699
but while we're watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was</font>

15
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,410
checking<font color="#CCCCCC"> my phone as I always do and I</font>

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,530
saw news about the attacks in Paris it

17
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,350
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days it was a couple of</font>

18
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:38,910
tweets that sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then</font>

19
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,040
obviously is the evening unfolded as we

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,350
were going about<font color="#E5E5E5"> our business here in</font>

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,750
New what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and more about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just completely breaks my heart</font>

23
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,660
and I know that my commentary is not

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,239
it's not needed really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know</font>

25
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,280
everyone everyone sad I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,600
person to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel sad I'm not the only</font>

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,280
person with family in Paris I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

28
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,050
sister lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Paris with her sons and</font>

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,239
her husband what's scary to me though is

30
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,640
I mean firstly how often I'm saying what

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,700
I'm about to say these days but secondly

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,240
is the the feeling<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like what happens</font>

33
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,040
after these moments and like what

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,330
everyone turns to and the quick

35
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,729
militarization of our cities and above

36
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:23,520
all of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> minds and the extremes to</font>

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,439
which we will go for safety which makes

38
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">sense if what we were being given was</font>

39
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,369
safety<font color="#E5E5E5"> with like the snoopers charter</font>

40
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,650
with all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff I don't know that</font>

41
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,570
we're necessarily being given safety I

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,060
don't fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't feel like safety to me</font>

43
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,220
you know it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like invasive</font>

44
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,549
privacy for the purposes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of any of the</font>

45
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,619
world owes to the purposes of fulfilling

46
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,869
some kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this is why we've been</font>

47
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,670
doing this all along and this is why we

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,009
didn't take in more refugees and this is

49
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:58,079
why this is why when as has been said

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,930
incredibly well over Twitter and

51
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,689
elsewhere this is what refugees are

52
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:04,990
running from you know

53
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,470
this is their daily reality and it is so

54
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,080
tallying that on the same day as these

55
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,700
attacks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the couple days before as</font>

56
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,610
well you know they're bringing in

57
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lebanon their big attacks and Baghdad I</font>

58
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,180
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feeling after nine eleven</font>

59
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,690
sort of vaguely but I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

60
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,069
understand it that much but the feeling

61
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,069
after july seventh which was when in

62
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,640
2005<font color="#E5E5E5"> london was bombed and there were</font>

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,099
attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the tube and attacks on a bus</font>

64
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:35,230
as well it became very manipulative and

65
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,000
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways as manipulation of fear</font>

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was mixed in with very real fear of</font>

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">course very very real fear my memories</font>

68
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:46,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that time I bits and pieces I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 13</font>

69
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,569
years old so I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was if I was a</font>

70
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:51,310
human and everyone was very worried and

71
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,360
everyone felt like someone they knew was

72
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,590
wrapped up in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a very</font>

73
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,360
understandable fear but then also like

74
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,370
the buses I remember taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus home</font>

75
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,019
and there were like three people on it

76
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:04,989
including me and just the streets were

77
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,769
very empty and for following<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks you</font>

78
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:10,450
would find you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that your parents</font>

79
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,700
all you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been cars that were like</font>

80
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,220
stuck behind buses<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd been stopped</font>

81
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,900
because they've been suspicious packages

82
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,880
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one hand it's so important to</font>

83
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,200
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vigilance because of course</font>

84
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,600
there are occasions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of copycat crimes</font>

85
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,440
there are times where people react to

86
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,170
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> events like this by trying to</font>

87
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">do their own of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course I'm not</font>

88
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,799
pretending that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> true and I</font>

89
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,390
also don't work for the security

90
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,910
services and I don't see what they see

91
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,400
because of so much of what they do has

92
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,769
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kept secret it must</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be frustrating</font>

93
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,260
also to hear people talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

94
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">a way where they don't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

95
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,590
perspective but on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand it is</font>

96
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,620
very easy for not just media but just

97
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,389
for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stoke those</font>

98
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:55,239
flyers and and use that feeling because

99
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,310
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a rush to it that's</font>

100
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,049
not to say it's necessarily pleasurable

101
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:01,150
but there's this feeling of like you're

102
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,549
operating at a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of your</font>

103
00:04:03,549 --> 00:04:05,109
kind of like it's like a buzz in a way

104
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,290
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you everything is in a buzz and</font>

105
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,910
it's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really worried what</font>

106
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like for Muslims in</font>

107
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,000
Europe at the moment

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,820
because in London I remember it wasn't

109
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,410
there were many cases of Islamophobia

110
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,048
though so you were seeing more coverage

111
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:24,060
a bit of course because it was in the

112
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,680
news and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say I hadn't been</font>

113
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,780
happening before but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font>

114
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,760
was this like heightened<font color="#E5E5E5"> level you know</font>

115
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">people saying that they went sit next to</font>

116
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:34,440
Muslims on buses that sort of stuff I

117
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,210
remember with some friends saying that

118
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,890
they didn't feel very<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe at the moment</font>

119
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,720
and their Paris haven't told them like

120
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,410
go to school come<font color="#CCCCCC"> home that is it so</font>

121
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,840
just is this fear it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> seer everywhere</font>

122
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,410
and fear within us often<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it can</font>

123
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,350
make us more safe but it can also make

124
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:54,390
us feel like we can never<font color="#E5E5E5"> be safe again</font>

125
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,610
it depends how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we approach it and we</font>

126
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:58,590
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very careful with the</font>

127
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,810
whispers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were passing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> along like if</font>

128
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,450
if you hear a rumor about something make

129
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,610
sure it's grounded in fact just just all

130
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,400
that sort of stuff oh no it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad</font>

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">to me it's really really very sad but I</font>

132
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,620
just hope that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as much as we</font>

133
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,140
can for the men women and children<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

134
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:19,050
were fleeing these terrorists and are

135
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,060
just looking for a safe place and it's

136
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,560
hard not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well about the</font>

137
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">drone strikes and the way countries have</font>

138
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,140
behaved in that region for such a long

139
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,180
time sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to think of it</font>

140
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,100
in terms of good sides and bad sides

141
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,140
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a false way</font>

142
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,000
of looking at it and that doesn't

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">reflect the reality of the situation and</font>

144
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our roles in every part of what we do</font>

145
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,910
on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> planet so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah so it's very sad</font>

146
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,280
start to the morning actually and very

147
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,860
start outside enter yesterday but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

148
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,180
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> blaziken because it's what John's</font>

149
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,370
here for it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> men</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in blazes podcast</font>

150
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,190
and he's got an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning and</font>

151
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,500
there was a moment of silence and

152
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,050
filming of silence and I remember

153
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">feeling like when we did those notes of</font>

154
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,880
silence at school like I understood

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,690
vaguely why we did them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> World War</font>

156
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,530
two in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> First World War and I hurt my</font>

157
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,390
knee near my grandparents were alive and

158
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,720
I had a connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it still felt distant whereas these</font>

160
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,630
moments feel so closely held

161
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,940
that something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like that</font>

162
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,550
was for me like a mark of respect and a

163
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,270
mark of sort of commemoration has just

164
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,450
become this moment to be still and be in

165
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,840
the moment and think of other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

166
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,540
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way that is much closer than there</font>

167

ever has been for me and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of that</font>

168
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,500
is probably growing older and but it's

169
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,930
