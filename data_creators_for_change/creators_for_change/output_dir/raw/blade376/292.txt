00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:08,639
yeah I'm with Jesus right now a game

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've been introduced to I think</font>

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,610
it's an Australian thing is where you

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,730
point at the ground and you do your

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,760
curiosity as we see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people will</font>

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,529
look but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it from a</font>

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,390
distance at Rachel it's gonna hold the

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,730
camera hello and we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">over any point so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how you play</font>

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:32,399
urban pointing so first of all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find a crowded area make sure people</font>

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,660
walk in both ways like a walkway or

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,090
somewhere busy like that and then just

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">step in the middle of the crowd and</font>

15
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,030
point at the ground where there's

16
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,579
absolutely nothing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

17
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,559
get each market walking past to stare

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,360
down at the ground where you're pointing

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,940
and for every market that does you get a

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,930
point however if any of the bypasses are

21
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,360
to snap find out what you're up to then

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,300
it's game over so the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get as</font>

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,500
many of them to stare down at the ground

24
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,870
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting caught and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,640
urban<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointing</font>

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,240
what

27
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,190
what

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,000
what

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,570
what

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,590
so there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it urban pointing can</font>

31
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,840
you beat the score of 14<font color="#E5E5E5"> before someone</font>

32
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,210
