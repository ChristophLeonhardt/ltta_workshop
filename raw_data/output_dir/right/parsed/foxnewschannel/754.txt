TAMMY IS WITH US TONIGHT TO
WEIGH IN ON THE RISING RAGE OF
IMMIGRATION AND HOW IT IS
SHIFTING ATTENTION FOR THEIR WAY
FROM POLICY AND RESOLUTION.
FIRST, MY TAKE.
IMMIGRATION WILL ALWAYS BE AN
EMOTIONAL ISSUE.
IT IS FOR ME.
MY PARENTS WERE REFUGEES FROM
COMMUNISM AND HUNGRY.
I AM AN IMMIGRANT HERE IN
AMERICA.
I HAVE BEEN DETAINED AT THE U.S.
BORDER BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM WITH
MY DOCUMENTS.
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST
FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCES OF MY
LIFE.
WORSE THAN THAT, ANOTHER TIME
OUR FAMILY WAS DETAINED WHEN MY
ELDEST SON SEPARATED.
THAT WAS 25 MINUTES.
AGAIN WITH ALL OUR ADVANTAGES
THIS IS NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT
OTHERS ARE GOING THROUGH.
WE REMEMBER THAT TRAUMA TODAY.
THE WAY TO MAKE SURE WE TREAT
EVERYONE HUMANELY IS NOT
YELLING, SCREAMING, AND CALLING
PEOPLE NAZIS, IT IS
WELL-DESIGNED AND COMPETENTLY
EXECUTED POLICY.
LET'S APPLY SOME LOGIC.
THE EMERGING VIEW ON THE LEFT IS
THAT MOST HUMANE POLICY IS JUST
TO SAY YES TO EVERYONE AT THE
BORDER.
THEY ARE FLEEING VIOLENCE AND
LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE, LET
THEM IN.
HOW HUMANE IS THAT, REALLY?
IT PRIVILEGES THOSE WHO ACTUALLY
GET TO THE BORDER.
THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
THERE ARE OVER 60 MILLION
REFUGEES ACROSS THE WORLD.
THAT NUMBER WILL INCREASE.
A HUMANE IMMIGRATION WERE NOT
JUST TAKE THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO
SHOW UP.
IT WOULD TAKE THOSE IN MOST
NEED.
WHAT ABOUT WHEN THEY GET HERE?
THERE ARE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES.
AS BERNIE SANDERS SAID, OPEN
BORDERS WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY IN
AMERICA POOR.
DOING AWAY WITH THE CONCEPT OF
THE NATIONSTATE AND BRING IN
PEOPLE.
THEY WILL WORK FOR TWO OR $3 AN
HOUR, I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT.
WE HAVE TO RAISE WAGES IN THIS
COUNTRY.
THERE ARE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES
TWO.
BARACK OBAMA TALKED ABOUT HIS
QUOTE PATRIOTIC RESENTMENT OF
SEEING MEXICAN FLAGS AT
IMMIGRANT RALLIES.
WHEN FORCED TO USE A TRANSLATOR
TO TALK TO A GUY FIXING MY CAR,
I FEEL CERTAIN FRUSTRATION.
OPEN BORDERS NEED MORE PRESSURES
ON SERVICES LIKE SCHOOLS AND
HOSPITALS.
DIANE FEINSTEIN ONCE RAISED
ABOUT THE HEALTH BUDGET BEING
SPENT ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS
BABY.
WHAT ABOUT CRIME?
IF WE WAIVED EVERYONE THROUGH ON
HUMANITARIAN GRANT, WE CAN ARGUE
ABOUT THE EXACT PROPORTION WHO
WOULD END UP COMMITTED VIOLENT
CRIMES.
NOBODY CAN SAY THAT NONE WOULD.
JUST AS CAKES FAMILY ABOUT THE
HUMANITY OF THAT.
THEN, WHAT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCE
OF IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES.
THEY ARGUED WE NOW HAVE AN
IMMIGRATION CRISIS IN AN
INTEGRATION CRISIS.
TEN OR 20 YEARS AFTER COMING
HERE, IMMIGRANTS ARE LIVING IN
POVERTY.
HIS WORDS ARE RACIALIZED INSTEAD
OF LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM.
HOW IS THAT HUMANE?
LOGIC TELLS US YOU HAVE TO
CONTROL IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM
SOMEHOW.
THE MINUTE YOU ACCEPT THAT, YOU
GET INTO THE REALLY TOUGH
QUESTION, WHO SHOULD WE WELCOME
AND WHO SHOULD WE TURN AWAY?
TURNING ANYONE AWAY IS HARD.
AS WE HAVE SEEN, FEELING TO DO
SO IS INHUMANE AS WELL.
THE REASON EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING
HIGH OVER IMMIGRATION IS THAT
SUCCESSIVE ADMINISTRATIONS LOST
CONTROL OF IT.
AMERICA IS AN OPENING COUNTRY.
BUT THE PUBLIC CONSENT DEPENDS
ON GOVERNMENT CONTROL OF
IMMIGRATION.
THAT'S WHY THIS ADMINISTRATION
IS RIGHT TO TRY AND IMPOSE ORDER
AT THE BORDER.
BUT, THE WAY THEY DID IT,
FRANKLY, WAS SHAMBOLIC.
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED A NEW
POLICY THAT WAS RIGHT AND
POPULAR.
ZERO TOLERANCE FOR ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION.
HOW COULD ANYONE, ESPECIALLY
DEMOCRATS AND NEVER TRUMP
REPUBLICANS WERE CONSTANTLY
SCREAMING ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP
UNDERMINING THE RULE OF LAW BE
AGAINST ZERO-TOLERANCE AND
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.
BUT, THE CONSEQUENCE OF THE
POLICY ARISING FROM THIS IS ON
POPULAR.
FAMILY SEPARATION.
IT COULD IT SHOULD'VE BEEN
PREDICTED.
A PLAN FOR BY THE
ADMINISTRATION.
HERE'S JOHN KELLY OVER A YEAR
AGO WHEN HE WAS STILL HOMELAND
SECURITY SECRETARY.
>> ARE YOU, THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY CONSIDERING A
NEW INITIATIVE THAT WOULD
SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR
PARENTS IF THEY TRIED TO ENTER
THE UNITED STATES ILLEGALLY?
>> I WOULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO
DETER THE PEOPLE FROM CENTRAL
AMERICA TO GETTING ON THIS VERY
DANGEROUS NETWORK THAT BRINGS
THEM UP THROUGH MEXICO AND INTO
THE UNITED STATES.
YES, I AM CONSIDERING IN ORDER
TO DETER MORE MOVEMENT ALONG
THIS TERRIBLY DANGEROUS NETWORK.
I AM CONSIDERING EXACTLY THAT.
THEY WILL BE WELL CARED FOR AS
WE DEAL THEIR PARENTS.
>> I HATE THE ANTI- TRUMP
PREMIUM AS MUCH AS ANYONE.
I AM DISGUSTED THE WAY THEY PLAY
POLITICS WITH THIS ISSUE TO
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
THE FACT REMAINS THAT THIS
DEMONSTRATION IS IN CHARGE, NOW.
JOHN KELLY OF PARTICULAR NEEDS
TO GET HIS ACT TOGETHER.
WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF.
WE NEED A BIG GOVERNMENT
RESPONSE AND IS THE CHIEF OF
STAFF'S JOB TO ORGANIZE IT.
AT THE HEART SHOULD BE SOMETHING
THIS PRESIDENT KNOWS ABOUT.
DONALD TRUMP IS A BUILDER, LET'S
GET BUILDING.
ASYLUM AND IMMIGRATION CENTERS
IN GUATEMALA, HONDURAS AND OTHER
PLACES SO THERE'S NO NEED TO
COME TO THE BORDER.
FOR THOSE WHO COME BILL PROPER
FACILITY SO PEOPLE CAN BE
HANDLED QUICKLY, FIRMLY, AND
HUMANELY.
BUILD THE WALL TO STOP THE
BORDER CROSSINGS.
ZERO-TOLERANCE PLUS MAXIMUM
