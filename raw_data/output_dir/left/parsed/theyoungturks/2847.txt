DURING MICHAEL WOLFF'S
INTERVIEW WITH THE TODAY SHOW HE
TALKED ABOUT VARIOUS CONCERNS
AND CHRIS'S HIM THAT WHITE HOUSE
STAFF HAD, INCLUDING HOW
INCREDIBLY -- HOW MUCH HE LACKS
INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY.
LET'S HEAR FROM MICHAEL WOLFF
HIMSELF ON THE ISSUE.
>>YOU SAID THESE SENIOR PEOPLE
INSULT HIS INTELLIGENCE.
WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS
PEOPLE WOULD SAY?
>>THEY SAY HE IS A MORON, AN
IDIOT, ACTUALLY THERE'S A
COMPETITION TO SORT OF GET TO
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE OF WHO THIS
MAN IS.
LET'S REMEMBER, THIS MAN
DOES NOT READ, DOES NOT LISTEN.
HE'S LIKE A PINBALL JUST
SHOOTING OFF THE SIDE.
>>AGAIN, THAT IS ANOTHER PORTION
OF HIS BOOK THAT I THINK HAS
BEEN -- IT REINFORCES STUFF WE
ALREADY KNEW, BECAUSE WE KNEW
TRUMP DIDN'T LIKE THE
INTELLIGENCE BRIEFINGS, WE KNEW
PEOPLE HAD TO GIVE HIM BRIEFINGS
IN TINY SPURTS BECAUSE THEY
COULDN'T GET HIS ATTENTION FOR
LONG PERIODS OF TIME ON
IMPORTANT ISSUES.
SO THIS BOOK
IN MY OPINION KIND OF REINFORCES
THOSE ELEMENTS OF TRUMP THAT WE
ALREADY HAD LEARNED ABOUT.
>>AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
HAVE, I'VE NOT READ THE BOOK
YET, BUT EVERYTHING I HAVE HEARD
ABOUT IT IS EXACTLY WHAT I
EXPECT WHEN I DO READ IT, AND
YOU WILL REMEMBER HE GAVE A
PRESS CONFERENCE ON REPEAL AND
REPLACE, HE SAID WE WILL GET
THIS DONE, SOMEBODY ASKED HIM
WHAT HE WANTS TO CHANGE, AND HE
HAD NO CLUE.
HE HADN'T READ THE
HEALTHCARE BILL, HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS
OTHER THAN THAT HE CALLED IT
OBAMACARE AND THAT WAS ENOUGH
FOR HIM, SO THAT'S CHILDLIKE.
IF
YOU LOOK AT HIS ENTIRE
ADMINISTRATION, IT'S REINFORCED
IN THESE PAGES.
>>LET ME DISAGREE WITH PART OF
WHAT YOU SAID, THERE IS 
NO WAY
IT WILL BE FOUR YEARS.
HIS
DEMISE IS SPEEDING UP, IT'S
BECOME KIND OF IRREFUTABLE.
WHEN
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE BOOK
SAYS, I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET
THE WRONG IMPRESSION.
BUT A
TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO
WORK AT THE WHITE HOUSE,
SOURCES, PEOPLE 
CLOSEST TO TRUMP
WHO WORK WITH HIM EVERY DAY, SAY
THESE THINGS ABOUT HIM. AND TO
ME THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, YES
HE'S NOT BRIGHT, WE KNOW THAT,
BUT HE SAID HE DOESN'T READ AND
DOESN'T LISTEN.
BUT FOCUS ON
THIS FOR A SECOND, IF YOU HAVE
THE MOST POWERFUL MAN ON EARTH,
IN CHARGE OF THE COUNTRY,
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
AND HE REFUSES TO LEARN
ANYTHING -- HE NEVER WORKED IN
POLITICS SO HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
THE NUCLEAR TRIAD IS AND DOESN'T
WANT TO.
ANYONE THINKS HE KNOWS
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUNNI
MUSLIM AND THE SHIITE MUSLIM?
AND THAT MAKES ALL THE
DIFFERENCE IN THE SAUDI
ARABIA/IRAN CONFLICT, BUT HE
DOESN'T KNOW IT AND NEVER WILL
AND WON'T LEARN IT, AND HE
DOESN'T EVEN LISTEN, BECAUSE IF
YOU AREN'T SAYING THE WORD TRUMP
HE DOESN'T CARE.
TO HAVE SOMEONE
THAT INDIFFERENT TO THE FATE
OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE
POLICIES WE HAVE ISN'T READILY
DANGEROUS.
>>YOU WANT THE LEADER OF THE
COUNTRY TO MAKE INFORMED POLICY
DECISIONS, AND IF HE'S NOT
WILLING TO LISTEN TO ANY
INFORMATION, THEN HE'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS.
BUT
LOOK, ALL OF THIS STUFF KEEPS
REMINDING ME OF STORIES THAT WE
HAVE DONE RECENTLY.
REMEMBER,
THE BIG STORY, I BELIEVE IT WAS
LAST WEEK, WAS THE FACT THAT A
NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER GOT AN
IMPROMPTU INTERVIEW WITH TRUMP
AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW, TRUMP
FELT THE NEED TO SAY THAT HE
UNDERSTANDS ALL THE BIG BILLS.
HE KNOWS THE BIG BILLS BETTER
THAN ANY PRESIDENT IN U.S.
HISTORY.
AND THE FACT THAT HE
FELT THE NEED TO SAY THAT, AND
MENTIONED THAT IN THE INTERVIEW,
I THINK IS ALSO TELLING.
HE IS
OBVIOUSLY INSECURE ABOUT HOW
MUCH HE KNOWS ABOUT THE
LEGISLATION HE'S TOUTING AND
LOOSELY.
>>IT'S LIKE THE KID IN HIGH
SCHOOL WHO SCREAMS OUT, I'M NOT
GAY!
NOBODY ASKED YOU, WHY DID
YOU SAY THAT?
OR THE KID IN THE
OVAL OFFICE WHO SAYS I HAVE A
BIG BUTTON, BIGGER THAN YOURS,
AND IT DEFINITELY WORKS.
THERE
IS SOMETHING YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY
INSECURE ABOUT.
CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF OBAMA OR CLINTON, OR REAGAN,
HAD SAID I KNOW ALL THE BILLS, I
KNOW THE BIG BILLS BETTER THAN
ANYONE.
