Switching to Allstate is worth it. WE MADE THE POINT THAT MUCH OF THE NEWS AMERICANS ARE TOLD IS FACTUAL TURNS OUT TO BE PROPAGANDA. HUMAN BEINGS LIE. POWERFUL PEOPLE TEND TO RELY QUITE A BIT IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR PREROGATIVES. JOURNALISTS OF THE ABILITY TO RESEARCH SHAPE PERCEPTION ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO DISHONESTY. THERE IS NOTHING CONTROVERSIAL ABOUT THAT. IT'S TRUE. YET MAYBE NOT SURPRISINGLY, A LOT OF REPORTERS FOUND IT DEEPLY OFFENSIVE. REPORTER AT "THE NEW YORK TIMES" CALLED IT "REPUGNANT." HE SAID IT'S "LITERALLY DAMAGING TO OUR DEMOCRACY THAT ANYONE WOULD DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF HIS NEWSPAPER." QUESTION "THE NEW YORK TIMES" THAT AMERICA FALLS APART. PRETTY FUNNY. IN OTHER NEWS, CARRIER HAS ANNOUNCED IT'S IMMORAL TO NOT USE AIR CONDITIONING. AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. SKEPTICISM IS NOT UNPATRIOTIC. IT'S YOUR DUTY. PRINCIPLED QUESTIONS DON'T DESTROY DEMOCRACY. THEY SUSTAIN IT. PEOPLE IN CHARGE DON'T LIKE TO BE SECOND-GUESSED AND WHY WOULD THEY? A SKEPTICAL POPULATION MAKES THEIR LIVES MORE COMPLETED. THEY WOULD LIKE YOU TO SWALLOW YOUR MEDICINE WITHOUT COMPLAINT. SHUT UP AND OBEY. DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. EXCEPT WHAT YOU ARE TOLD AND GET BACK TO WORK. THAT'S A LOT TO ASK. ESPECIALLY COMING FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES" WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF INTERESTING DETAIL IN THAT NEWSPAPER DAY-TO-DAY AND GOOD FOR THEM FOR PRINTING IT. BUT THERE'S ALSO AN AWFUL LOT OF LYING, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE BIG THINGS. REMEMBER WHEN "THE NEW YORK TIMES" SPENT AN ENTIRE YEAR ASSURING US THAT SADDAM HUSSEIN HAD WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION? WE WENT TO WAR OVER IT. MANY THOUSANDS DIED, AND IT WAS A LIE. HOW ABOUT WHEN THE TIMES TOLD US BARACK OBAMA'S TOPPLING OF MUAMMAR QADDAFI WOULD TURN LIBYA INTO "A PRODUCTIVE PARTNER WITH THE WEST." IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO KNOW WHAT THE FAMILIES NOW BEING SOLD IN LIBYA IS OPEN SLAVE MARKET THINK OF THAT PREDICTION. WHO CAN FORGET THIS TIMES HEADLINE FROM THE SPRING OF 1975 WHEN THE KHMER ROUGE TOOK OVER CAMBODIA. "FOR MOST, A BETTER LIFE." A THIRD OF THE POPULATION WENT ON TO DIE IN GENOCIDE IN CAMBODIA. THE TIMES HAS YET TO ISSUE A CORRECTION. NOWADAYS, THE TIMES IS HYPING THE RUSSIAN HOAX TELLING US MOSCOW IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO THIS COUNTRY WHEN IT'S CLEARLY NOT. THE PAPER IS TRYING TO PROVOKE YET ANOTHER POINTLESS WAR IN SYRIA BY PUSHING THE CLAIM THAT BASHAR AL-ASSAD GASSED HIS OWN PEOPLE. AT TIMES REPORTERS PRETENSION OVER SHORT AND THAT HAVE HAPPENED. THEY DON'T KNOW IT FOR CERTAIN. THEY ARE LYING. WE COULD GO ON. WE ARE NOT MAKING A PARTISAN POINT. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" IS HARDLY THE ONLY POWERFUL INSTITUTION THAT DISTORTS THE TRUTH. SOMEDAY SOON MAY BE THIS WEEK, THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE MAY ANNOUNCE AN AMNESTY FOR MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. THEY WILL TELL YOU LETTING FOREIGNERS IGNORE OUR LAWS IS GOOD FOR AMERICA. DON'T BELIEVE THEM. THEY ARE LYING. OUR COUNTRY HAS CHANGED A LOT ON THE DIVIDE IS NO LONGER BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WERE GIVEN BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT. IT'S REALLY BETWEEN THE INCOMPETENTS IN CHARGE AND EVERYONE ELSE. A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE HAS BECOME RICH AND POWERFUL, MISMANAGING THIS COUNTRY. I HAVE WRITTEN A BOOK ABOUT THEM. IT IS CALLED "SHIP OF FOOLS," OUT IN OCTOBER. ORDER IT NOW IF YOU WANT. IF YOU DON'T REFLEXIVELY OWE ANYBODY OR LEGIONS OUTSIDE YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY THAT INCLUDES THE NEWS MEDIA.
