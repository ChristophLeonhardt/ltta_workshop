I think that I think that the greatest ally that the Republicans have is the incompetence and stupidity of the Democratic Party the the 2016 in fact I have a feeling that Schenk actually might agree with me on this that 2016 election Donald Trump became President of the United States right Hillary Clinton was the worst candidate in the history of mankind and that had so you know the Republican message I never thought was a particularly losing message I just think that what we have right now is such a polarized politics that it's going to be very difficult for anybody to pass anything in this climate I also think that what we have almost a reactionary feel on both sides like what I like about this debate is that were actually talking about ideas which is actually pretty rare in this in this in this sphere well what's become more common is that on the left there's this there's this retreat to intersectionality is in identity politics this idea that if we can cobble together a group of people who are feeling victimized by American society you know we have black people and we have a stand of people and we have women we have gays and lesbians and transgenders and they all feel really bad about how American politics is going and if we push that notion we can create a coalition there'll be a brand new coalition never before seen in American politics and that requires a woman to run or that requires a black woman to run or that requires a minority to run if they do that then what you're going to see from and I think an equally nasty way from the right is a response that says okay well if you're gonna do identity politics you will see some white identity politics from the right which i think is really negative I don't want to see either of those things but I would like to see is the Democrats campaign on the bigger on the on the stronger involvement of government in your life and higher taxes program that Schenk wants them to campaign on the Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren program and I would like to see the Republicans campaign on my program a smaller government libertarian program that says the government should get as much out of our lives as much as humanly possible
