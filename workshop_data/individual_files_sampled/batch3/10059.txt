things were appropriate to enhance his capacity to better monitor implementation of resolution 1540 the committee considered an approved last year a revised matrix format the changes made streamlined existing matrix by better reflecting the obligations contained in resolution 1540 in accordance with resolution 23 25 the revised matrix also takes into account the specificity of the stage with respect to their ability to manufacture and export related materials during 2018 the committee's group of experts will convert existing mattresses to the new format with the objective to better support the states in developing more detail and effective assistance requests and to better provide them in response to the request with effective assistance that meets their needs the committee revised its assistance template in March 2017 this will in effect the straight in the committee's effort as much maker the new assistance template is published on the committee's website the committee received new assistance requests from Belize Kenya and Tajikistan the requests were sent to potential assistance providers and summaries were published on the committee homepage as usual in 2000 2000 17 the committee also considered how to improve the facilitation of technical assistance to States and decided to task its group of experts at the state's invitation and subject to available resources to actively facilitate assistance with this the committee aims had been able to close a gap in assistance for those states and regions that are committed to implementation supplementing their obligations but have not been recipients of assistance offers so far in 2017 the committee continued to exchange information with relevant international regional and sub-regional organizations involve them in its outreach activities for example 15:40 POC training courses and encourage them to highlight obligations of resolutions 1514 in the model as legislations and/or guidelines or training of the states as appropriate in total in 2017 there were 53 outreach events by an with by and with international regional or sub regional organizations in which the chair committee members and experts participated the committee also continued to develop its website website as a tool to raise public awareness and serve as a source of information and source of resolution 1514 full use and by member states committee members civil society and industry the new design of the website finalized in 2016 provides enhance user usability and appeal on 24 December 2017 after consultations with the committee the United Nations secretary-general appointed six new experts for the 1540 group of experts as during 2017 the term of some previous experts had ended three in three new experts have already joined the group while the remaining new colleagues will fall by 10 of April 2018 in that regard a process will be initiated to select a new coordinator for the group of experts in the nearest future the outgoing members of the Security Council Japan and Egypt service coordinators of the committee's working group 1 and monitoring and national implementation and working group 3 from cooperation with international organizations including ISIL dyes and al-qaida sanctions committee and countering terrorism committee respectively I wish to thank both delegations for their vital contribution to the work of the committee in that sense on behalf of the committee I'd like to welcome mr. Henry Prieto from the delegation of the room as coordinator of the working group of monitoring on national implementation and mr. Antonin be a chief from the delegation of Code Ivoire as coordinator of the working group on cooperation with international organizations including including the ISIL guys and al-qaida sanctions committee and in counterterrorism committee both of them started working as new coordinators of the working groups on 4 April 2018 I like sincerely to thank those states that have made substantial contributions to the United Nations Trust Fund for global and regional disarmament activities directly in support of 1540 implementation without these contributions the committee would be severely hampered in fulfilling its mandate in overseeing the implementation of the resolution and in facilitating capacity-building where it is most needed in 2017 funds were used for grants provided in early years by Canada Germany Japan Kazakhstan the Republic of Korea and the United States and from donations made by Japan and the European Union in 2017 before closing I'd like to make a few additional points with regard to the committee's plan outreach activities in the near future as for my own country Bolivia we plan to host a regional conference on 15 for implementation in May this year for Latin American and Caribbean countries the government of the protonation estate of Bolivia in cooperation with the 1540 committee will convene a conference for the States of Latin America and the Caribbean on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1540 and it's follow-up resolutions in La Paz from 9 to 10 May 2008 een the conference is dedicated to actively support implementation of the resolution in the Latin America and Caribbean region it will provide a platform for States to present their existing laws and regulations that serve their implementations and it will especially provide an opportunity to exchange views and effective practices on the hand-laid for related materials with a view to straightening the regions record on implementation on resolution 1540 the committee is considering conducting conducting another regional assistance conference at an appropriate time in 2018 here the committee will continue to draw on the good collaboration already established with the key international organizations to help with the delivery of assistance and support for related activities regarding cooperation with international regional organizations and human entities the tasks set out in resolution 23 25 25 are a specific the committees group of experts has already had a meeting with the counterterrorism committee accepted its a secretariat to prepare future country visits later this year and with CTR ITF on how best to collaborate to support 1540 committees activities in particular with respect to scientific and technological trends and the risk of misuse by non-state actors with regard to the key international organizations that support this world the 1540 committee will take advantage of the visits to New York but head of these organizations to meet the committee in order to encourage the support to resolution 1514 implementation in continuation of the so called with battlin process which stands for an active dialogue between states and industry on effective implementation of export controls and which was initiated by germany two more regional events designed to engage industry are so far planned for 2018 one is a regional meeting taking place 1617 April in New Delhi India and the other one will take place in September 2018 in the Republic of Korea these activities are supported by a crier grant to the trust fund from Germany if any members of the committee would like more information on these events particularly regarding possible participation do not hesitate to get in touch with a group of experts I'd like to conclude by reiterating my commitment to the full implementation of resolution 1540 the threat of use of weapons of mass destruction by non-state actors are clear and evolved in reality the 1540 committee will continue its efforts to prevent its this danger with a strong support of the member states and other international partners the committee with the support of its group of experts and the UN office for this armament Affairs is done ready to cooperate with an as requested to facilitate assistant to states with their 15 for implementation efforts that will contribute to achieving our common objective to prevent the catastrophic use of weapons of mass destruction by non-state actors before closing mr. president I'd like to thank all the delegations that have participated in the in not just in our work but also in concluded our our program of work that has been just distributed without thank you very much very United Kingdom thank you very much mr. president many thanks indeed to our Bolivian colleague for his briefing and the work of his committee we welcome the new coordinators and may I say at the start that we were very pleased to have been paired with Equatorial Guinea in terms of capacity building mr. president 1540 was the first subject I worked on when I came to the Security Council ten years ago my first time here so I'm very pleased to have the opportunity to talk about it today and to be able to say that for the United Kingdom the 1540 Committee is a vital component of the international order we need to empower it to fulfill its mandate and we need to support it to the hilt mr. president as a number of us have said this week already we were seeing a situation that the Security Council should read that chemical and biological weapons became a routine part of fighting and regrettably we have been confronted in very recent weeks by multiple incidents of the use of weapons of mass destruction by non-state actors the UN joint investigative mechanism found Dyess use mustard gas on at least two occasions in Syria there were multiple instances of mustard gas use by daesh in iraq in australia a planned chemical terrorism attack was thwarted in July last year these incidents clearly exemplified by the 1540 committee and its work to prevent the proliferation of nuclear chemical and biological weapons by non-state actors is so important these events mr. president are awful enough yet in acts of unbelievable irresponsibility those risks have been exacerbated by the use of weapons of mass destruction by state actors the chemical weapons attacks in Duma the attempted murders in Salisbury at the most recent instances but we also have the assassination of Kim jong-nam in Malaysia and the horror of concha Kuhn a little over a year ago mr. president I take this opportunity to say that in respect of Salisbury and the invitation for this council to keep members updated we have requested a Security Council meeting next week where we would like to brief on the outcome of the OPCW findings it is a worrisome pattern the state use of WMD and it clearly undermines our collective efforts to determine eradicate the use of these weapons by state and non-state actors alike we very strongly support the work to increase States capacity and we're encouraged that there are now only thirteen non-reporting states any non-reporting is troubling but it is good that the number is going down and as I say we were delighted to be paired with Equatorial Guinea and provides support but it's clear that we stand on the cusp of a nightmare where weapons of mass destruction are you with impunity where our citizens live in real fear of an indiscriminate attack at any time and without warning it's not enough just to condemn this we need to find a way to take meaningful action and ensure that there are meaningful consequences for perpetrators we have all benefited from the international order that has kept us safe since the end of World War two it behooves all of us mr. president to make every effort to uphold this international architecture it's clear that not all countries share this view and we have talked about that several times this week so I just want to say that in respect of this particular committee 1540 there is one council member who has sorted every opportunity to slow progress and dilute the substance of every proposal whether this is program of work deadlines calls to action efforts to take progress forward all of these have sadly being consistently watered down and the panel of experts has even been prevented from travelling mr. president if we are serious about dealing with the threats that the committee was set up to counter then this state of affairs can't continue since last February the 1540 committee has met formally only once and the actions agreed in the 2017 program of work have barely made progress that means also that the commitments made in relatively modest resolution 23:25 have not been fulfilled the new program of work has only just been agreed two months later than legally mandated and in these three months the committee was left without a clear sphere of objectives and activities to pursue mr. president I cannot think of any legitimate reason why any country would want to affect the work of the 1540 Committee add firstly in this way and I appeal to everybody around the table to redouble efforts so that we have an ambitious program of work for the committee we must stand up for the universal norms and standards we have spent decades building to create an effective and powerful non-proliferation regime whether that deals with state actors or it deals with non-state actors thank you very much mr. president the red collar is not the renewing of the either la palabra the real estate if you go to the representative of the Netherlands thank you very much mr. president first let me express our gratitude and appreciation to the chair of the 1540 committee our esteemed colleague from Bolivia for his briefing on the work of the 1540 committee and for his efforts to achieve full implementation of resolution 1540 we furthermore welcome the new members of the panel of experts and the coordinators and we wish them well in their new position mr. president I will touch upon three points first the threat of weapons of mass destruction secondly the importance of resolution 1540 and thirdly our work going forward my first point the threat of weapons of mass destruction the use and the threat of the use of weapons of mass destruction to international peace and security Israel and remains real when such attacks occur death comes in a gruesome way survivors have to deal with the aftermath of such attacks for the rest of their lives the current situation is also impacted by the challenges and opportunities presented by scientific and technological developments and we feel very strongly that this aspect should not be forgotten in the committee's work let me also reiterate that we fully support the ambition of the chair to bring the number of national reports to 100% as he just mentioned mr. president this brings me to my second point the importance of the 1540 mechanism to prevent weapons of mass destruction proliferation among non-state actors to address death threat resolution 1540 is key with its focus on the use of WMDs by non-state actors this resolution fills a clear gap in the international non-proliferation regime the resolution also complements the important other work that is undertaken in the area of nuclear security let me mention for example the IAEA as well as the impetus in this field that was achieved through the Nuclear Security Summit cycle therefore full implementation of resolution 1540 should be a priority for azole we underline the importance of capacity building in states who need assistance when it comes to export controls an issue also just mentioned by the chair this is an issue which is not also relevant for 5040 committee it's a relevant issue in many of the subsidiary of organs my third point mr. president the urgent need for concrete measures to strengthen the implementation of resolution 1540 a lot of the importance of its implementation we are pleased that the agreement finally has been reached on a program of work this morning let me congratulate my colleague of Bolivia for this achievement however this is not a time to be complacent now we need concrete action the committee must continue its work effectively and efficiently in line with the measures laid out in resolution 23:25 especially those and clauses 8 & 9 I would reach towards the wider membership it remains a key priority for us and we welcome in particular the conference just mentioned by the chair to host the conference especially focused on Latin American that especially Caribbean countries as three of the autonomous countries in their kingdom I their aerobic chorus sounds in my phone in conclusion mr. president by reiterating we should reiterate our support to the important work of the 1540 committee it's necessary to build on the momentum created by the 2016 comprehensive review and only by better working together on the implementation of this resolution both in this council but certainly also with the wider membership I mean by better working together in that way we can prevent weapons of mass destruction falling into the hands of terrorists thank you very much mr. president and I quorum that they kind of presentative reference I'm sort of quizzes doll the president Sasha UNT as well as his team for holy breathing for the work done just got the helm of the medium 40 today's adoption of its working program which has been under discussion for like a year time on the Syrian government that the missions team the fact-finding mission will consist of two groups these two groups will arrive separately to Syria on Thursday today as well as tomorrow on Friday the OPCW sent for passports to the Syrian embassy in Brussels the visas were granted immediately so the Syrian government has granted immediately for visas to for persons of the team the Syrian government inquired about the passports of the second group and the answer was that they are not yet ready meaning that they are uncle the Syrian government is ready to grant the visas for the second team the moment it receives the passports and to make the process swift and easy for the team the Syrian government informed the OPCW that the visas could be granted at the crossing border with Lebanon meaning that we are even ready by leveraging achievements made in past years nurse mr. president through the adoption of resolution 1540 in 2004 and all the resolutions that followed the Security Council has established the threat of pression and the use of WMDs specifically by non-state actors as among its priorities if it has thereby Illustrated its role as custodian of the non-proliferation regime however the latter is presently clearly under threat it is tested on many fronts by the persistent risk of a nuclear North Korea by the ongoing destabilizing ballistic activities in the Middle East and by the emergence of chemical weapons in Syria with the use by the Assad regime and by daesh in Salsbury and elsewhere moreover a proliferation is no longer within the sole domain of a single type of actor there is a risk of non-state actors gaining access to sensitive material this is a dangerous reality for this in its context in order to contain and stamp out proliferation it is more incumbent upon us than ever before to step up our mobilization this is why this is the reason for being of resolution 1514 the resolutions related to it and this remains more timely than ever before committee 1540 is an architect for the operations of all states and their efforts to to stage a concerted effort against proliferation and here I wish to pay tribute to to the group of experts their analysis and awareness raising efforts are indispensable for the action of committee 1540 the review they conducted in 2016 has confirmed this there has been progress in implementation of resolution 1540 and falling resolutions and this progress is tangible tangible both nationally and regionally however and the irrefutable progress achieved in recent years notwithstanding a great deal is yet to be done mr. president each of us must naturally strive to calibrate implementation efforts for resolution 1540 we must all prevent and suppress the financing of proliferation we must secure to the greatest possible stance sensitive material and goods on our soil we must step up export control specifically in the light of risks of exploitation of emerging technologies a risk which we must address for its part France has modernized its national legal mechanism to combat proliferation it now criminalizes the proliferation related activities and represses financing there of my country is also specifically engaged in prevention of risks of the terrorists gaining access to sensitive nuclear and radioactive material specifically radioactive sickness sources whose security needs to be reinforced we held the initiatives of the Global Initiative to combat nuclear terrorism and the global g7 partnership against proliferation of WMDs which we shall share in 2019 mr. president I wish to particularly emphasize an approach of cooperation assistance and engagement which should prevail over all of our efforts because we are more effective together we must not undertake non-proliferation efforts in an isolated way on cooperation and assistance I wish to assure you that of our commitment which serves to coordinator the working group the working group of on assistance the aim is to step up the effectiveness of the assistance mechanism based on the tracks that have been mentioned we attribute particular importance to stepping up the regional dimension of the approach to assistance and better alignment of needs and the offer proposed organisation of regional events such as that organized by the AU in 2016 is an successful formula which should serve as a source of inspiration and leverage we also welcome the initiatives undertaken by other actors that have been mentioned I would mention a specific role of the EU through the dynamism and consistency and steadfastness of its awareness-raising this helps to fuel cooperation to be effective we must also take stock of the challenges we face by stepping up synergies with the fora confronting the same challenges outside of the UN such as the IAEA opcw the World Customs organization z' organization or Export Control regimes and other bodies within it I am specifically thinking of committees dealing with terrorism these interactions should be cultivated mr. president allow me to recall something else which is evident at a time when challenges art or security continue to proliferate there can be no alternative to an elaboration regime this is a consistent policy from which France has never deviated which we shall continue to uphold by fully supporting contributing to the operations of committee 1540 thank you quarter president I thank the representative of France for his statement and I'll get the floor to the representative of the United States thank you very much mr. president and thank you to to ambassador your ENT for your your presentation on the work of the committee to implement resolution 1540 which really was a landmark resolution in its day that has become one of the pillars of the international non-proliferation architecture given ongoing and evolving threats posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction today's briefing reminds them as reminds us of the critical importance of fully implementing resolution 1540 for the sake of international peace and security the shocking use of chemical weapons in Iraq in Malaysia the United Kingdom as well as the egregious and systematic use of chemical weapons in Syria so that the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction is all too real today furthermore the continued proliferation of WMDs by irresponsible actors increases the likelihood that these heinous weapons or the capacity and knowledge to develop them will fall into the hands of non-state actors who carry out terrorist attacks given these persistent threats the United States will continue to prioritize efforts to strengthen our counter-proliferation measures in line with our national security strategy and the Nuclear Posture review our efforts are aimed at ensuring our security and the security of the international community in order to prevent WMD proliferation non-state actors the full and universal implementation of resolution 1540 is integral to achieving this goal the United States will continue to provide strong support to a wide array of international organizations contributing to non-proliferation and provide extensive bilateral assistance to States seeking to implement their obligations under the resolution the United States has already provided over 4.5 million dollars in grants to the 1540 Trust Fund which helps encourage States to address gaps and implementation of their 15/3 obligations we also continue to invest hundreds of millions in our partner countries for Cooperative Threat Reduction and other non-proliferation and export control related assistance programs around the world to reduce the threat of WMDs we commend the chair's plan to hold a regional conference in Latin America next month improving implementation exchanging best practices to strengthen national obligations across Latin America is very important as a testament to our commitment to the region we have helped fund a grant for the Regional Coordinator project in the Organization of American States inter-american Committee against terrorism which is now helping OAS members to develop 1540 national implementation action plans and will promote implementation of the resolution turning to the many tasks that lay ahead for the committee it is clear that the committee must redouble its efforts to implement its program of work to enhance global implementation of 1540 while we regret that it took nearly three months to adopt the program of work we are pleased that we can finally begin moving forward again now is the time for the committee to address real and evolving challenges in particular the United States believes the committee should prioritize four areas in the coming weeks first the committee must meet more regularly and develop a clear strategy for achieving the many elements of his program of work last year after holding one formal committee meeting the chair promised to convene more meetings and get the committee back to work and we look forward to seeing him follow through on this promise second since the committee has selected new experts it should now turn to initial initiating a formal process for appointing a coordinator this will also help the committee on track the Committee on track for continued progress we look forward to working with the incoming experts who are critical to helping the committee carry out its very important mandate third the committee must also seek to develop best approaches to enforce appropriate and effective laws to implement 1540 including by developing national control lists and finally in 2016 the committee adopted the the Council adopted resolution 23 25 and said it would focus on the challenge of controlling access to transfers of Technology and the evolving nature of the risks of proliferation due to rapid advances in science technology and international commerce we hope the committee can take advantage of a wide array of civil society and industry resources to examine ways to combat these threats in closing the United States recalls that 1540 a chapter 7 resolution is binding on all member states implement implementation of its provisions is not optional for any member state and in particular in today's context we see no greater risk of chemical weapons falling into the hands of terrorists than an unverified and uncounted accounted for chemical weapons per program for our part the United States will continue to fully support the work of the 1540 Committee to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction I thank you very much to president Larrabee I thank the representative of the United States for her statement and I now give the floor to the representative of Equatorial Guinea Thank You mr. president the delegation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea welcomes the holding of this meeting today and we would like to express our congratulations to the chair of the 1540 committee ambassador Sasha Sergio laurentiu Solis permanent representative of the glory national Republic of Bolivia would like to thank him for his leadership dedication as in the work that he has carrying out as head of the important 1540 Committee we'd also like to thank the entire committee and the outgoing group of experts the work that they have done and we reiterate to the new team the preparedness of Equatorial Guinea to work with you and participate actively in the work of the committee mr. president we've taken good note of the report of the chair of the 1540 committee and the activities carried out during 2017 we welcome the progress that the committee has made or with regard to the presentation of national implementation action plans by new States including them our own country last year we presented our own report to the committee this is a significant step towards achieving this goal and we would point out that Equatorial Guinea will continue to work towards the full and correct implementation of resolution 1540 of the United Nations Security Council mr. president I would encourage you to and I would encourage the chair of the 1540 committee to continue to publish the implementing measures of the 1540 resolution there are only 13 states remaining that make us fall short of universality of the na PS we need to join our efforts together with the 1540 Committee towards the goal of universality and this is why we need to continue to make progress in these discussions Equatorial Guinea is extremely concerned at the growing threat of terrorism and the risk that non-state actors could acquire develop or use nuclear chemical or biological weapons or traffic in them which would have unforeseen and devastating consequences for humankind the threat is real and it's very serious for global security developed countries have immense infrastructure and security services that are able to the terrorist threat and prevent non-state actors from using the weapons of mass destruction but they must bear in mind that if they don't help developing countries to have available to them the same kinds of traffic trap tracking monitoring and security infrastructure particularly at border points these loopholes could be used by non-state actors and terrorists to get hold of materials that could lead to the manufacture and proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction this is why it's imperative for all states to spare no effort not only in prioritizing the adoption of national implementing measures pursuant to resolution 1540 but it's also important for states such as Equatorial Guinea to provide for other measures to ensure that there can be correct and successful implementation of the measures referred to in the resolution Equatorial Guinea recognizes the significant progress that has been made by the international community in the elimination of chemical weapons in this regard we would like to stress the need for there to be destruction of all categories of weapons of mass destruction so that humankind can live without the fear of the threat posed by these weapons mr. president last Tuesday the 10th of April this Security Council once again showed itself unable to be effective in the conflicts being experienced by the Syrian people by not being able to give an opportunity to Syrian girls and boys to have a place to play without fear of the next bomb not to be able to give Syrian women the opportunity to go out and take a walk or give the opportunity to the elderly or the sick to find medicine or go to hospital is it so difficult for this council entrusted as it is with ensuring global security to find a solution for all of these people who place such high hopes in this decision-making body of the United Nations is it so difficult for us to reach agreement on an independent investigative mechanism which can identify those responsible for using chemical weapons in Syria the Syrians have suffered seven years of war the Second World War only lasted five the Republic of Equatorial Guinea would call upon all parties involved in this conflict and which have a greater or lesser influence on the country to think a little bit about these Syrian girls and boys that are suffering so much think of them as if they were our own children or grandchildren these Syrian women think of them as if they were our wives or sisters and these elderly men and women let's think of them as if they were our mothers and fathers mr. president we must urgently work on a new draft consensual proposal the proposed graph resolution to establish a new mechanism for monitoring and attribution of responsibility for the use of chemical weapons I thank you I thank the representative of Equatorial Guinea for your statement and energy the floor to the representative of Poland president I think about Saddam Sasha Loretta Solis for his briefing and all I would like to express my delegation support for his further efforts in steering the 1540 committee Poland attaches great importance to its commitments on the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction with full conviction we do support implementation of legally binding instruments such as the non-proliferation treaty convention of the prohibition of chemical weapons and biological weapons convention resolution 1540 constitutes an important complementary tool in this area since it addresses more more likely the weapons of mass destruction related threats posed by the non-state actors UN Security Council resolution 23:25 calls upon States to take into account on the evolving nature of risk of proliferation and rapid advances in science and technology in their implementation of resolution 1540 rapid technological advances in use domain continue to outpace national and international regulations non-state actors became more creative in weaponizing new technologies use of weapons of mass destructions by terrorists is dreadful reality let me just mention that the joint investigative mechanism attributed use of chemical weapons in Syria also that not only - - all these developments proved that the resolution 1540 is not only still irrelevant but importance of its full implementation it's perhaps even greater that ever before we also believe it is possible to build synergies between the 15:40 committee and other relevant international regional and sub-regional organizations as well as functional groupings such as the Global Partnership in you see barren centers of excellence the OEC and the proliferation Security Initiative they all have tools to assist nations in a better implementation of the non-proliferation commitments mr. president we are pleased at the program of work of the committee adopted earlier today recognized the need for a structure more regular discussion based on monthly expert meetings of the committee we hope that that these regular sessions will contribute the delivery terrorization of the committee's work as well to an increase implementation of the resolution 1540 we also hope that the process of selecting a new coordinator of the group of experts will be finalized soon according to an established principle Thank You mr. president I thank the representative of Poland for her statement and I now give the floor to the represent the focus extend mr. president I thank ambassadors such a warranty the chair of the 1540 Committee for his very informative briefing in the face of rapidly increasing threat of WMD the implementation of resolution 1540 and 2325 is becoming most vital and especially considering the present threats be setting us the work of the committee is more relevant than ever Carlson was his principal position against the threat of WMD has always supported and will continue to support the activities of the committee first Callison will continue the tradition of allocating voluntary contributions to the UN trust fund for global and regional disarmament activities in order to assist the committee in ensuring implementation by States their obligations under the resolution 1514 secondly we congratulate the committee on the new composition of the group of experts who wish success to the representatives of Peru and cultivar on their new appointments as coordinators of working groups one and three we should always keep in our mind that the threats of WMD falling into the hands of non-state actors together with the rapid growth of new technologies are subject to evolution and improvement the committee is doing a lot to respond to such threats in a timely manner and act proactively in the report as we requested last time we see a huge work done on outreach activities increasing the number of countries providing the national reports monitoring and technical assistance that help increase the ability of states to confront modern threats of weapons of mass destruction portfolio thirdly we must not lose sight of nuclear security my president not another buyer during the opening ceremony of the low-enriched uranium bank of IAEA in Kazakhstan last August note that the important of the resumption of the Nuclear Security summits that used to be conducted by the United States from 2010 to 2016 we're in favor of resuming such regular high-level meetings to discuss topical issues related to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction taking into account the evolving nature of the risk of WMD proliferation including the use by non-state actors of rapid advances in science and technology we reiterate our initiative to establish a UN register on scientific developments leading to the creation and advancement of WMD which would track such dangerous discoveries as you know Palestine has developed and promotes with the support of the UN community the code of conduct towards achieving a world free of terrorism its implementation will contribute not only to the goals and tasks of the UN counterterrorism committee but also the activities of the 15:40 committee pointing out to the importance and the necessity of protecting critical facilities from the threat of terrorism we expressed our thought to the program of work of the 1540 committee for a new period and hope for its effective implementation in its work the committee should help ensure that national policies and practices of member states are consistent with the goal of completely eliminating the threat of weapons of mass destruction finally mr. president I would like to reaffirm Karstens firm commitment to consolidate the efforts of the world community to read the world of WMDs and this aim must be achieved by consistent strengthening and expansion of the non-proliferation regime primarily within the framework of 1540 I wish to express the gratitude of my delegation for excellent work and solid action plan of the committee and especially note the able leadership of its chair our esteemed colleagues are already my delegation wants once again to assure our full support of the committee's work and readiness to act engage in his activities I thank you mayor I've quadrupled I thank the representative of Kazakhstan for his statement and I now get the floor to the representative of cote ivoire Thank You mr. president mr. president my delegation would like to thank ambassador Sasha Sasha Laurentiis Ali's permanent representative of the Republic of Bolivia president chair of the 1540 committee would like to thank him for briefing us on the activities of the committee charged with the implementation of resolutions on weapons of mass destruction the subject at hand today is particularly important and poignant given the recent allegations of the use of chemical weapons in Syria mr. president by adopting unanimously on the 28th of April 2004 resolution 1540 our council was addressing the challenge of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and we made this resolution an important part of the global security architecture but 14 years on from the adoption of the resolution our world continues to live under the persistent threat of weapons of mass destruction which constitute a genuine challenge to the non-proliferation regime this real threat which is constantly evolving is of concern to the entire international community certainly we do welcome the significant progress that has been made in implementing resolution 1540 and subsequent resolutions but we must admit that a lot still remains to be done given the risk posed by the acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by non-state actors particularly by terrorist organizations Cote d'Ivoire continues to be extremely concerned by the risk of seeing these non-state actors develop acquire manufacture possess transport transfer and use nuclear chemical and biological weapons or their means of delivery this is why we strongly support action to prevent the proliferation of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and their means of delivery and why we feel that appropriate oversight mechanisms must be put in place in order to prevent their trafficking my delegation reaffirms the importance of international cooperation and coordination in order to effectively implement resolution 1540 in order to put an end to this genuine threat to international peace and security moreover it's important to ensure the effective application of and strict respect for relevant international legal norms as they pertain to non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in this regard strengthening cooperation in the area of border control monitoring our financial flows and internet networks and legal assistance is more necessary than ever before mr. president delegation of Cote d'Ivoire would also like to draw the attention of the counsel in the international community to the issue of the security of numerous stockpiles of fissile material which are not covered by any international regulation and which could be used to manufacture weapons of mass destruction the potential for of these stockpiles being available could increase the risk of the substances may be made accessible to terrorist groups on this point Cote d'Ivoire would call upon Member States with the help of the OPCW to meet their international obligations deriving from the

of the international non-proliferation regime over the years the resolution and the work of the committee have played an important role in strengthening the international non-proliferation regime and enhancing the capacity of all states to prevent proliferation at present the international non-proliferation situation remains challenging of course all parties to continue setting up collaboration and synergy first it is necessary to build kalitta consensus and achieve common security it behooves all countries to subscribe to the new concept of security that is to work towards common comprehensive collaborative and sustainable security build a security architecture that is fair and just for all and by all create a peaceful and stable international environment and eradicate the soil that breathe terrorism and proliferation activities as soon as possible second it is necessary to strengthen state responsibility and from pragmatic cooperation the primary responsibility for non-proliferation lies with governments respect and support should be accorded to countries in developing anti proliferation policies in the contest of their national realities improving their non-proliferation legislation all parties should deepen pragmatic non-proliferation cooperation on the basis of equality and neutral respect and focus on meeting the needs of developing countries for international assistance in the area of non-proliferation third it is necessary to uphold the fair and balanced approach and look for solutions through political and diplomatic means all parties

representative of China for a statement and give the floor to the representative of Russia Thank You mr. president we thank the permanent representative of Bolivia Laurenti mr. söze for his briefing on the work of the Security Council committee committee 1540 we wish to thank ambassador the ambassador of Bolivia and his delegation for their stewardship of the Security Council subsidy your body for their flexibility and for their ability to incorporate various points of view in the outcome a diamond in the drafting of documents we also wish to thank the entire team of the group of experts for their professionalism the fight against the proliferation of WMDs is among the Russian Federation's military and political priorities as with all other pressing matters what is necessary here is concerted coordinated efforts on the part of all states barring none we are keen to find common ground with our partners to expeditiously advance the non-proliferation agenda especially in the light of the fact that issues in this realm continue to escalate Security Council resolution 1540 Russia and the US were at its source this resolution rightly holds pride of place in the global non-proliferation architecture this is geared towards building a robust legal and law enforcement bulwark to to the prevention of not of WMDs falling into the hands of non-state actors including terrorists the value of resolution 1540 also lies in the fact that it constitutes a tool for cooperation not for coercion nor for the imposition of services what was adopted following the review process the new resolution 2325 reinforces the 1540 non-proliferation capacity it fosters an exchange of best practices in its implementation helps to boost the effectiveness assistance delivered to states in need whilst at the same time accounting for their specific needs our view is that responsibility for implementation of the resolution is borne by states international and regional organizations industry business academic scientific circles as well as other groups and civil society play an important a subsidiary role by assisting States in the implementation of the specific provisions of this important Security Council resolution the institutional framework of the resolution is aligned with the goals set forth we believe that the assessment of the operation of the Security Council subsidiary body or the group of experts should be approached in a realistic manner the creation of additional bureaucratic structures around the issues of 1540 limitations on the duration of contact of experts or artificial advancement of radical ill-advised proposals are liable to create additional obstacles and this will not improve effectiveness in the work of the committee thereby it is important to be guided by the cooperate and do no harm principle in the light of the persistent activity of the Islamic state in Syria and activity of other terrorist groups there they have mastered the technology of chemical weapons production and they are actively using this technology in the latest importance of cooperation to suppress this heinous phenomenon a chemical terrorism only Rises moral what is important to operate in a concerted way bearing in mind that as the situation in Syria develops terrorists including terrorists who have gained practical experience in chemical weapons use they will attempt to take cover in third countries mr. president for our part we are eager to strengthen the WMD non-proliferation regime including through the implementation of Security Council resolution 1540 we stand ready to constructively engage with the chairmanship of the committee and with our partners now turning to the references voice today into the incident of in

that the number of states that have submitted their national reports have reached 180 as indicated by the chair of the committee in our view this is a clear manifestation the political commitment of member states to address the threat posed by proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the remains of delivery and materials we however note with concern that over the 13 UN member states that have yet to submit at least a first national report eleven are in Africa you have also noted with great concern from a recent informal briefing by the group of experts to the committee that in terms of overall implementation as well as implementation in relation to the establishment of domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction particularly in relation to control in related materials putting measures in the areas of accounting securing physical protection border and law enforcement export and trade related controls Africa remains far behind as compared to other regions it is in this context that I would like to welcome the upcoming training for points of contact for the African region which will be held in Addis Ababa Ethiopia in cooperation with African Union I would also like to reiterate our previous call for enhanced cooperation with African Union in the implementation of the common African defence security policy and other regional frameworks such as the ethical nuclear weapons-free zone or further like to encourage the committee to strengthen its assistance framework to member states upon the request with a view to addressing the implementation gaps particularly in the area of domestic control measures as well as in adopting and enforcing appropriate and effective laws that comprehensively addresses the proliferation risk posed by non-state actors including terrorists is important for the committee to work closely with a group of experts to address the challenge in relation to the systems framework Patek in the area of much making the availability and conditions of assistance for all states as well as the limited number of responses to assistance request we have noted from the report of the chair that there is a plan to undertake country visits later this year with the counterterrorism executive directory in the group of experts had a meeting with city ITF to identify areas of collaboration in addition further collaboration between the 15:40 committee group of experts members of the analytical support and sanctions monitoring team established pursuant to Security Council resolution in 1526 and 2253

of mass destruction to and through non-state actors is constantly evolving and the global non-proliferation framework is under immense pressure again and again in recent years we have witnessed the use of chemical weapons by both state and non-state actors and in line with the comment by the British ambassador it is this cannot be allowed to become the new norm it is imperative that we hold perpetrators to account and show the world that the use of these weapons remain unacceptable we must recognize the changing engine nature of the threat react adapt and step up our efforts let me reiterate once again our regret that the council has failed to wish a new attribution mechanism for the use of chemical weapons in Syria we will continue to support efforts that aim to achieve this
