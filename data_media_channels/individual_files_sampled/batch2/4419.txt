how might a judge be able to discern whether Michael Cohen was acting in the capacity of an attorney who is consulting the President or a fixer who happens to be a lawyer who was helping the president how was he going to how is this judge going to go about making that distinction your question goes to the heart of the matter today because it may be the case that the judge has nothing to do with deciding what is privileged and what is not privileged that's what the battle is about today Cohen and Trump won Cohen and his lawyers to review these seized documents and and decide what is and is not privileged their argument the argument they're concerned is that if the government even with the taint team reviews these documents they might accidentally think oh well this is not privileged and hand it over and there's no unring that Bell they may also not even know what they're looking at in terms of documents and hand it over to the the main team of the SDN why and that again is something that they can never come back from and that is something that is an understandable concern the problem for Cohen and Trump is that this procedure as questionable as it is has been approved for some time although grudgingly Michael Cohen the president's personal attorney is inside that Manhattan federal courthouse we saw him go inside as a few moments ago Michael avenatti is also there avenatti said that at Friday's hearing that he had quote every reason to believe that some documents seized from Cohen related to his client his client in question being stormy Daniels : addressed reporters outside this courthouse just a few moments ago here's what he said I'm gonna let the judge control her courtroom as she always does she a very capable and able and be careful guys for me here guys be careful I don't want anybody get hurt she could have a message from Michael coming you don't want anybody having to find a lawyer why is it important for her to come today well I mean I think it's important because she's dedicated to the cause the American people do all the facts and get all the information I think Michael told you a lot of trouble well you aware of the broader crow I think any recording that Michael telling me without people's permission there's a big big problem Mike repelling it possibly the present United States guys be careful I don't want me to get hurt the stormy requests to come here or did you've got to convince her to come I don't have to convince Miss Dana cause of anything this Daniel sister she calls the shots she's the client now she have a message for Michael Cohen well I think her message has been consistent and that is she wants everybody to tell the truth they stop live appreciate that so what do you expect to happen today Daniel's have any message for the first lady yes I'm gonna say something the President to the first lady Michael Cullen be representing himself you know there's an old saying that any attorney that represents himself has a fool for a client that would certainly be true in this instance no doubt there's Michael Colvin gonna have anything to be afraid of affairs of recordings the judges recordings of him and you or your client or sittings do with your case well I don't know that the judge would have any such recordings but if Michael Cohen was making any recordings of anyone without their permission I think appointed by the judge or mr. Collinson from we may weigh in on that because see how things progress here today why do you think implementation the documents first I mean I don't think there's any question that this matter should be similar to any other battery that is all right Michael avenatti there outside that federal courthouse in Manhattan avenatti has made his way inside the courtroom now hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
