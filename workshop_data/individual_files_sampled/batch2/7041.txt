following Megan Kelly addressing Bill O'Reilly on her show and criticizing him rather aggressively Bill O'Reilly decided to strike back by going on Glenn Beck's radio program and here's what he had to say take a listen number one she didn't file a complaint not that I know of we've never brought to our attention that megyn kelly did anything all right so I'd like to see it because I don't believe that's true at all number two what she does not say is that there's an anonymous hotline and it had been four years at Fox News where anybody could have called up and said so-and-so is doing something to me and you better stop it all right that's anonymous doesn't mention it I never had any problem with megyn kelly in fact when she was getting hammered earlier this year I wrote a column sticking up for her you know I don't I don't know why megyn kelly is doing what she's doing I don't know why I've helped her dramatically in her career I gave her the name of her show the Kelly file she actually did a charity event for me I mean it is just incomprehensible you just he helped her out so much he gave her the name of the show the Kelly file I mean it took a very clever individual to come up with that name yeah and still she's worried about the sexual harassment she suffered at the hands of others and she doesn't want other women at the company to suffer the same fate ungrateful despite the fact that he came up with hey Kelly file and you know what's what's amazing is that he did exactly what megyn kelly called him out on on glenn beck show so he brings back these two letters handwritten letters that megyn kelly allegedly wrote him one dating back to 2009 the other dating back to 2012 he's like look we had a great relationship she thanked me the 2009 letter was following the birth of one of her children and apparently he gave a gift or something like that and so she thanked him for the gift he's like see besties we've been besties forever I don't know I don't know why she's doing this and then the second one was after he promoted O'Reilly promoted Megyn Kelly's husband's book after it was published but anyway again he's trying to you know smear her name and make it seem as though she's making things up and it's just that's exactly what she accused him of so he's playing right into that and by the way if I didn't know that somebody was a sexual harasser and they did something nice for me and I wrote him a nice thank-you notes later that doesn't mean that when I find out there is sexual harasser that that note still applies right right like I don't I might if somebody might have given me a bottle of wine and I write him I next think you know and turns out later they're a murderer I on me I didn't know that okay so what a preposterous defense he has no defense his main defense is my kids and and I talked about it earlier in the show and he keeps saying oh they're putting he literally say they're putting my kids in the kill zone oh why are you bringing your kids into this you maniac okay why he said it over and over and over again don't hide behind your kids it's pathetic it's gross and then he goes to well no one technically technically no one complained to human resources then he goes to well yeah okay she might have been sexually harassed and I wanted to cover it up but at some point when she didn't know that I was one of the bad guys she wrote me a nice note these are the world's worst defenses support independent media come join us at the Young Turks TYT Network calm /join
