1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
State of the Union
addresses can be a type

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,280
of partisan Pilates for some.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,830
For others, it can
be a direct ticket

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:13,130
to becoming an internet meme.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,080
Behind many of these reactions

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,170
is a careful calculation,
and we break it down.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:25,960
You won't find many Democrats jumping out
of their seats for President Trump.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,630
Senator Joe Manchin of
West Virginia is the exception.

9
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,080
He’s sitting right in the front.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,380
And that’s likely
not a coincidence.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,330
Here he is again
applauding Trump’s jab

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,640
at those who kneel for
the national anthem.

13
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,000
And again after Trump
mentions rising wages.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,730
It’s a re-election
year for Manchin

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,070
and he’s in a state that
overwhelmingly voted for Trump.

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,650
Now he’s apparently showing
support for a president

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,140
from the opposing party.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,000
Let’s go to the other
side of the aisle.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,550
“We repeal the core of
the disastrous Obamacare.

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:03,780
The individual mandate is now gone.
Thank heaven.”

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,580
Did you catch that?

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,890
Overwhelming excitement,

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,680
except for Senator Lisa
Murkowski of Alaska.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,550
Last summer,

25
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,500
Murkowski played a
key role to squash

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,480
efforts to repeal
the Affordable Care Act.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,640
“Working with the Senate,

28
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,970
we are appointing judges
who will interpret

29
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:28,180
the Constitution as written,
including a great new Supreme Court justice.”

30
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:30,280
President Trump
threw a compliment right

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,300
at Neil Gorsuch,

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,950
but he didn’t take the bait.

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,260
“... in the history of
our country.”

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,210
Did you notice who stood?
Senator Joe Manchin.

35
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,080
But justices must make careful
and largely coordinated

36
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,440
choices about what statements
are uncontroversial enough

37
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,000
to warrant applause.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,410
“We can achieve
absolutely anything.”

39
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,140
“America is grieving
for you.”

40
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:11,032
“Kenton Stacy would have died if it were not
for Justin’s selfless love.”

41
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,870
Another group that attempts
to play it down the middle: the military officials.

42
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,980
Like the justices,

43
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,280
they must decide what
is partisan platitude

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,270
and what is not.

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,780
“And I will not stop until
our veterans are properly

46
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,860
taken care of, which has
been my promise to them

47
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,860
from the very beginning
of this great journey.”

48
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,690
“We must modernize and rebuild
our nuclear arsenal, hopefully

49
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,130
never having to use it.

50
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,180
But making it

51
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,410
so strong and so
powerful that it

52
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,160
will deter any
acts of aggression

53
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,730
by any other nation
or anyone else.”

54
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,410
Watch as they hesitate.

55
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,600
“That the coalition 
to defeat ISIS has liberated

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,200
very close to 100 percent of
the territory.”

57
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,600
To clap or not to clap? In a
deeply divided Congress,

58
00:03:32,600 --> 00:00:00,000
applause or silence can
send a powerful message.
