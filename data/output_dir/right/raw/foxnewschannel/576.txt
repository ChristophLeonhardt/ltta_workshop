1
00:00:01,822 --> 00:00:02,590
KIM JONG UN THAT HE IS

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:05,293
SUPPOSEDLY DELIVERING TODAY?

3
00:00:05,293 --> 00:00:07,195
>> President Trump: WE ARE

4
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:09,197
HAVING A VERY IMPORTANT SET OF

5
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:09,964
DISCUSSIONS TODAY, TOMORROW, AND

6
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:11,265
THE NEXT DAY.

7
00:00:11,265 --> 00:00:13,000
WE HAVE BEEN HAVING THEM FOR

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,104
QUITE SOME TIME.

9
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,140
SINCE YOU FIRST GAINED OFFICE,

10
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,007
AND YOU ARE DOING A TERRIFIC

11
00:00:20,007 --> 00:00:21,842
JOB.

12
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:23,010
I THINK WE ARE DOING A TERRIFIC

13
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,378
JOB TOGETHER.

14
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:27,381
WE HAVE HAD TERRIFIC TALKS ON

15
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:29,483
TRADE, AND WILL BE SIGNING IN A

16
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:31,485
LITTLE WHILE, A VERY IMPORTANT

17
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:33,020
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH SOUTH KOREA

18
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,256
AND THE UNITED STATES.

19
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:35,957
AND I THINK IT IS A VERY

20
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:39,327
EXCITING EVENT.

21
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:40,962
IT WAS LONG TIME IN COMING AND

22
00:00:40,962 --> 00:00:44,198
IT IS A BASIC REDOING OF THE

23
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:45,700
AGREEMENT THAT WAS DONE BEFORE,

24
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,568
WHICH WAS A VERY UNFAIR

25
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,570
AGREEMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES.

26
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,306
I THINK THAT PRESIDENT MOON AND

27
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:55,176
MYSELF ARE VERY HAPPY.

28
00:00:55,176 --> 00:00:56,611
IT IS GREAT FOR THE

29
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:57,345
SOUTH KOREANS, IT IS GREAT FOR

30
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,879
THE UNITED STATES, IT IS GREAT

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:00:59,447
FOR BOTH.

32
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:01,682
WE HAVE TALKED, OBVIOUSLY, ABOUT

33
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:02,083
NORTH KOREA.

34
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,484
WE ARE MAKING TREMENDOUS

35
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:06,120
PROGRESS.

36
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,189
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEEN REALLY,

37
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,924
VERY OPEN AND TERRIFIC, FRANKLY.

38
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:13,261
I THINK HE WANTS TO SEE

39
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,230
SOMETHING HAPPEN.

40
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,732
SO, MUTUALLY WE HAVE DONE VERY

41
00:01:17,732 --> 00:00:00,000
WELL WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KORE
