1
00:00:00,387 --> 00:00:02,222
PROPERTY HE CAN ASK, BUT HE

2
00:00:02,222 --> 00:00:02,790
HASN'T ASKED YET.

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:03,424
>> Martha: THAT IS WHAT

4
00:00:03,424 --> 00:00:03,791
HAPPENED.

5
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:05,359
IT WENT VIRAL AS I SAID.

6
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,662
IT'S ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

7
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:11,865
HERE IS BEN SHAPIRO, EDITOR OF

8
00:00:11,865 --> 00:00:12,299
DAILYWIRE.com.

9
00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:13,067
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10
00:00:13,067 --> 00:00:13,934
THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE

11
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:14,301
SHOW.

12
00:00:14,301 --> 00:00:15,636
YOU SAID THIS IS A RIDICULOUS

13
00:00:15,636 --> 00:00:16,070
STUNT.

14
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,171
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15
00:00:17,171 --> 00:00:18,505
>> I MEAN IT'S A RIDICULOUS

16
00:00:18,505 --> 00:00:19,807
STUNT IN THE SENSE IF CONGRESS

17
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:21,408
WANTS TO CHANGE THE LAW RIGHT

18
00:00:21,408 --> 00:00:23,277
NOW TO ALLOW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT

19
00:00:23,277 --> 00:00:24,411
DETAINEES TO STAY WITH THE

20
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,412
CHILDREN THEY COULD DO THAT.

21
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:26,480
THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOT MOVING

22
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,114
TO DO THAT.

23
00:00:27,114 --> 00:00:28,182
HERE IS THE REAL ISSUE.

24
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:30,217
THE ISSUE IS UNDER AMERICAN

25
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:34,588
LAW THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF

26
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:37,057
APPEALS SAID THIS.

27
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:38,659
WHEN THEY ENTER WITH THE

28
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:39,760
CHILDREN, THE CHILDREN MUST BE

29
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,628
REFERRED FROM OUT OF THE

30
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:42,896
SYSTEM TO GUARDIAN FIGURE.

31
00:00:42,896 --> 00:00:45,399
SO THAT MEANS THE KIDS WILL BE

32
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:47,034
BY LAW SEPARATED FROM THE

33
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:49,169
PARENTS WHEN THE ILLEGAL

34
00:00:49,169 --> 00:00:51,038
PARENTS COME ACROSS THE

35
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:51,672
BORDER.

36
00:00:51,672 --> 00:00:54,241
THE DEMOCRATS IS SAYING TRUMP

37
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:56,977
IS SEPARATING THEM FORCIBLY.

38
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:58,245
BUT WHAT THEY WANT LIKE TO SEE

39
00:00:58,245 --> 00:01:00,414
IS A MASS ATTEMPT BY TRUMP

40
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:01,748
ADMINISTRATION NOT TO ENFORCE

41
00:01:01,748 --> 00:01:02,983
THE IMMIGRATION LAWS AT ALL.

42
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:04,617
SO THE ANSWER IS INSTEAD OF

43
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:05,686
RELEASING KIDS AND THE

44
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:07,121
PARENTS, LET'S RELEASE

45
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:07,588
EVERYBODY.

46
00:01:07,588 --> 00:01:08,722
KIDS, PARENTS, EVERYBODY.

47
00:01:08,722 --> 00:01:10,057
IF YOU WANT TO ENFORCE THE

48
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:11,692
IMMIGRATION LAW AND YOU WANT

49
00:01:11,692 --> 00:01:13,193
TO KEEP KIDS WITH THEIR

50
00:01:13,193 --> 00:01:14,528
PARENTS YOU COULD MAKE A LEGAL

51
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:15,729
FIX FOR THAT.

52
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:16,430
>> IT'S A GREAT POINT.

53
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,364
IF YOU GO THROUGH THE

54
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:18,499
CONGRESSIONAL PROCESS AND YOU

55
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,334
TRY TO CHANGE THIS YOU WILL

56
00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:21,401
RUN HEAD LONG IN THE ISSUE OF

57
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:22,903
THE IMMIGRATION REFORM IN THE

58
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:23,971
COUNTRY TO SAY WHY ARE WE

59
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:24,872
DOING THIS, RIGHT?

60
00:01:24,872 --> 00:01:25,772
HOW IS THIS WORKING?

61
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:27,341
WHY ARE WE SEPARATING THE

62
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:27,774
CHILDREN?

63
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:29,309
WE ARE SEPARATING THE CHILDREN

64
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:30,811
BECAUSE THEY COME ACROSS AND

65
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:32,212
IN SOME CASES THEY DON'T NEIF

66
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:33,046
THE CHILDREN ARE THE CHILDREN

67
00:01:33,046 --> 00:01:35,315
OF THE PARENTS OR WHETHER OR

68
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:36,316
NOT THEY ARE TRAFFICKED IN THE

69
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:36,750
COUNTRY.

70
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,552
THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

71
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:38,919
FAMILIES.

72
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,287
IN MANY CASES THEY DON'T KNOW.

73
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:41,622
THEY DON'T HAVE PAPERWORK.

74
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:43,190
IN SOME CASES THEY CAN'T

75
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,424
COMMUNICATE THAT PROPERLY.

76
00:01:44,424 --> 00:01:46,226
SO IN SOME SITUATIONS THE KIDS

77
00:01:46,226 --> 00:01:46,994
ARE IN DANGER.

78
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,629
AND THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE

79
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:50,097
THING TO SEE THEM IN THE

80
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:53,600
HOLDING CENTERS.

81
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,068
IN SOME WAYS DO YOU BELIEVE

82
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:56,670
IT'S TRUE THEY BROUGHT IT ON

83
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,137
THEMSELVES?

84
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:59,373
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THE KIDS

85
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:00,340
BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES.

86
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,275
>> Martha: I MEAN THE

87
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:02,442
FAMILIES BEING SEPARATED.

88
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:03,377
>> KNOWING WHAT THE STATUS OF

89
00:02:03,377 --> 00:02:04,978
THE LAW IS.

90
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:06,947
IS THE STATUS OF THE LAW IS

91
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:08,782
WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW WHY IT

92
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:10,616
CHANGES BASED ON THE PRESIDENT

93
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:11,451
OF THE UNITED STATES ENFORCING

94
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:11,818
THE LAW.

95
00:02:11,818 --> 00:02:13,220
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE KIDS

96
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,821
STAY WITH THE PARENTS BUT THE

97
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,423
EASIEST WAY IS ALLOW THE KIDS

98
00:02:16,423 --> 00:02:17,658
TO STAY WITH THE PARENTS OR

99
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:20,761
THE PARENTS NOT COMING

100
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:21,295
ILLEGALLY.

101
00:02:21,295 --> 00:02:22,329
DEMOCRATS LIKE MERKLEY SAYS

102
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:24,998
THE BEST WAY TO FIX IT IS NOT

103
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:26,099
ENFORCE THE LAW.

104
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,268
HE IS IN FAVOR OF THE

105
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:29,703
IN FAVOR OF THE CATCH AND

106
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:30,871
RELEASE POLICIES TO ALLOW

107
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:32,239
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS PARENTS TO

108
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,173
BE RELEASED AND THEY NEVER

109
00:02:33,173 --> 00:02:34,408
SHOW UP FOR THE COURT DATE.

110
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:35,709
IF YOU ENFORCE THE IMMIGRATION

111
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,378
LAW UNDER THE NINTH CIRCUIT

112
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:39,580
COURT OF APPEALS RULING YOU

113
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,148
MUST TAKE THE KIDS AWAY FROM

114
00:02:41,148 --> 00:02:41,682
PARENTS.

115
00:02:41,682 --> 00:02:43,250
THAT IS NOT FAULT OF THE

116
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,684
CONSERVATIVES.

117
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:44,818
THAT IS THE PEOPLE ON THE LEFT

118
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,957
ON THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF

119
00:02:49,957 --> 00:02:51,325
APPEALS BELOVED BY THE

120
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:52,192
DEMOCRATS THE WORLD OVER.

121
00:02:52,192 --> 00:02:52,993
>> Martha: WE TALK ABOUT THE

122
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:54,027
ISSUES OVER THE WEEKEND THE

123
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:54,895
PRESIDENT, THE ABILITY TO

124
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:55,963
PARDON YOURSELF AND ALL OF

125
00:02:55,963 --> 00:02:57,097
THAT, WHETHER IT'S

126
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:57,931
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND THE

127
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:00,901
MUELLER INVESTIGATION OVERALL.

128
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:02,836
LOST IN THE SHUFFLE IS A TWEET

129
00:03:02,836 --> 00:03:08,408
SAYING OH, IT'S 50 -- IT'S DAY

130
00:03:08,408 --> 00:03:09,509
500 OF THE PRESIDENCY.

131
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:10,744
THAT COULD BE THE MARQUEE

132
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:11,411
MOMENT OF THE DAY.

133
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,412
BUT BECAUSE OF THE OTHER

134
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:13,614
TWEETS WE ARE NOT TALKING

135
00:03:13,614 --> 00:03:14,615
ABOUT IT.

136
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:15,916
I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK ON

137
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,717
DAY 500.

138
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:19,052
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE IS DOING?

139
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:20,120
>> HE HAS GOVERNED MORE

140
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,888
CONSERVATIVELY THAN I

141
00:03:21,888 --> 00:03:22,256
IMAGINED.

142
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:25,926
HE'S THE MOST CONSERVATIVE

143
00:03:25,926 --> 00:03:27,928
PRESIDENT OF MY LIFETIME.

144
00:03:27,928 --> 00:03:29,963
BUT IN TERMS OF HIS RHETORIC,

145
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:33,200
IT'S WHAT IT IS.

146
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,668
HIS RHETORIC IS WHAT IT IS.

147
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:38,105
WE HAVE AREAS TO BE GRATEFUL

148
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:38,805
FOR POLICY.

149
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:43,477
I WISH HE WOULD KEEP RHETORIC

150
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:44,911
POLICIES TO HIMSELF.

151
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:45,846
>> Martha: THE EAGLES

152
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:47,447
DECIDED NO IT TO GO TO THE

153
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:48,015
WHITE HOUSE.

154
00:03:48,015 --> 00:03:49,082
SO THE PRESIDENT SAYS HAY

155
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:49,850
DON'T LIKE MY POLICY.

156
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,118
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

157
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:51,818
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS A HABIT

158
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:54,021
OF SAYING YOU CAN'T QUIT, YOU

159
00:03:54,021 --> 00:03:54,821
ARE FIRED.

160
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:55,956
I'M NOT SHOCKED BY THE

161
00:03:55,956 --> 00:03:57,124
PRESIDENT'S RESPONSE TO THIS.

162
00:03:57,124 --> 00:03:58,759
I HAVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF THE

163
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,726
SPORTS TEAMS VISITING THE

164
00:03:59,726 --> 00:04:00,827
WHITE HOUSE.

165
00:04:00,827 --> 00:04:02,229
I SEENS LIKE CELEBRITY

166
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,264
CULTURE -- IT SEEMS LIKE THE

167
00:04:04,264 --> 00:04:06,099
CELEBRITY CULTURE AT THE

168
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:06,433
FINEST.

169
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:07,801
I DON'T LIKE KIM KARDASHIAN OR

170
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,102
THE EAGLES AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

171
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:11,138
I DON'T WANT THEM JUST BECAUSE

172
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:12,239
THEY'RE FAMOUS TO BE AT THE

173
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:12,839
WHITE HOUSE.

174
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:14,675
THIS IS WHERE POLICY SHOULD BE

175
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:15,042
DONE.

176
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:18,978
NOT PHOTO OPS.

177
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,314
>> I'M TOLD THAT TRUMP

178
00:04:20,314 --> 00:00:00,000
DISINVITED THEM SO MAYBE HE IS
