ONGOING STORY WITH A LOT OF
COMPANIES ACROSS THE UNITED
STATES.
>> Shepard: A STORY THAT'S
NOT YET WRITTEN,
CHRISTINENA, THANK YOU.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.
>> Shepard: VERY UNUSUAL
CASE PLAYING OUT RIGHT NOW
FIGHTING FOR THE ISLAMIC
STATE.
AT THE HEART OF ALL OF IT,
QUESTION OVER WHAT RIGHTS
AMERICANS HAVE WHEN THEY GET
SUSPECTED OF FIGHTING FOR
THE ENEMY.
SPECIFICALLY FOR ISIS.
WE DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT
THIS AMERICAN EXCEPT THAT HE
IS GOING BY JOHN DOE FOR THE
MOMENT AND FOR THE PAST NINE
MONTHS THE UNITED STATES
MILITARY HAS BEEN HOLDING
HIM IN CUSTODY IN IRAQ
WITHOUT ANY CHARGES.
NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
IS LOOKING TO RELEASE HIM
AND RETURN HIM TO SYRIA.
THE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES
UNION, WHICH IS REPRESENTING
THE GUY HAS CALLED THAT A
DEATH WARRANT.
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
CORRESPONDENT JENNIFER
GRIFFIN WITH THE NEWS FROM
THE PENTAGON.
JENNIFER?
>> SHEPARD, YOU DON'T
USUALLY HAVE THE ACLU,
AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES
UNION, PETITIONING THE U.S.
MILITARY TO KEEP AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN IMPRISONED, BUT, IN
THIS UNUSUAL CASE, INVOLVING
A U.S. CITIZEN, IT DID.
KNOWN IN THE FILING BEFORE
U.S. DISTRICT COURT AS JOHN
DOE, AS YOU MENTIONED, THIS
AMERICAN WAS PICKED UP ON
THE BATTLEFIELD BY A
U.S.-BACKED MILITIA IN SYRIA
AND DETAINED AS AN ENEMY
COMBATANT IN IRAQ SINCE LAST
SEPTEMBER.
THE U.S. MILITARY HAD HOPED
TO TRANSFER HIM TO A COUNTRY
WITH A, QUOTE, STRONG AND
SOVEREIGN INTEREST.
THAT REQUEST WAS DENIED BY A
U.S. FEDERAL JUDGE.
IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE
MILITARY WANTED TO TRANSFER
THE ALLEGED AMERICAN ISIS
FIGHTER TO THE U.S. FOR
PROSECUTION, TO GUANTANAMO
BAY, OR TO A THIRD COUNTRY.
THEIR REQUEST WAS
ESSENTIALLY DENIED AND JUST
THIS WEEK THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT INFORMED THE
COURT THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT
PLANNED TO RELEASE THIS
AMERICAN IN SYRIA WITHIN 72
HOURS.
THAT'S WHEN THE ACLU AGAIN
STEPPED IN, ARGUING FOR A
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER,
QUOTE:  WHAT THE GOVERNMENT
IS OFFERING OUR CLIENT IS NO
RELEASE, IT'S A DEAF
WARRANT.
DISGRACEFUL WAY TO TREAT AN
AMERICAN CITIZEN.
NOW OUR FIGHT FOR OUR
CLIENT'S RITE FOR DUE
PROCESS HAS BECOME A FIGHT
FOR HIS RIGHT TO LIFE.
TODAY IN COURT THE
GOVERNMENT ARGUED AGREED NOT
TO RELEASE A PRISONER UNTIL
A HEARING ON JUNE 20TH.
SHEP.
>> Shepard: JENNIFER, WHAT
ELSE ARE WE LEARNING FROM
THE PENTAGON ON.
THIS MARK MITCHELL THE
PENTAGON'S DEPUTY ASSISTANT
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR
SPECIAL OPERATIONS INFORMED
THE COURT THIS WEEK THAT THE
DEFENSE SECRETARY HAD
AUTHORIZED THE AMERICAN
PRISONER'S RELEASE IN THE
SAME AREA WHERE HE WAS
DETAINED IN SYRIA AND WOULD
NOTIFY THE LOCAL SYRIAN
DEFENSE FORCES THAT THE U.S.
IS NOT SEEKING HIS DETENTION
AND THAT HE SHOULD BE
ALLOWED SAFE PASSAGE.
QUOTE, PRISONER JOHN DOE,
QUOTE, WILL BE GIVEN $4,210
IN CASH, THE SAME AMOUNT
THAT HE HAD IN HIS
POSSESSION WHEN HE WAS
CAPTURED.
HE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED A
NEW CELLULAR PHONE IN ITS
ORIGINAL FIELD PACKAGING
WHICH HE CAN ACTIVATE.
HE WILL BE PROVIDED FOOD AND
WATER.
THE ACLU SAYS THIS IS A
DEATH SENTENCE, A
