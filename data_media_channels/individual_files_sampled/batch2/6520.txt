discussions of our current endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria in a lot of the media has a tendency to focus on the particularly high-tech nature of the weapons used we have this idea you know they're described as smart weapons they're super accurate very rarely do we focus on the people it's more on man we really have some amazing accurate weapons but some new reporting actually from the New York Times might lead you to believe that we were misled about how how minimal the civilian casualties have been in those conflicts and so I want to give credit to Osment Khan and Anand Gopal for their reporting here but here are some numbers to consider the coalition this is particular to Iraq has conducted more than 27,000 500 strikes to date with everything from you know b-52s and to Predator drones according to the coalition's available data 89 of its more than 14,000 airstrikes in Iraq II resulted in civilian death this is since the beginning of the Iraq war since the beginning of the fight against Isis for Iraq in particular the 14,000 airstrikes yeah I'm not exactly sure about the timeline I know that they've they've restricted it specifically there I believe that it's capped out at the beginning is during the fighting Isis I don't believe this from the beginning of the war but feel free to check that in any event the comparison between the two is roughly likely to be as true if you extend it back farther so that would amount to about one in every 157 strikes results in civilian deaths which automatically if you pay attention the news should probably be a little bit suspicious there but the New York Times decided to send some of its reporters to the ground in Iraq to investigate some of these issues now they're saying overall in the coalition as since August of 2014 it has killed tens of thousands of Isis fighters and 466 civilians in Iraq okay that's that's the sum total the Coalition says has been killed give or take a few but to the new york times between April 2016 and June of 2017 they visited the sites of nearly 150 airstrikes across northern Iraq not long after Isis was evicted from those locations and then they did a variety of different ways of sort of gathering information interviewing people gathering intelligence on the ground talking with some of the military in the region examining a bomb fragments looking at local news sources and those sorts of things one in five of the coalition strikes they identified resulted in civilian death a rate more than 31 times that acknowledged by the coalition now they're saying that it's likely that it's actually higher than that because of the difficulty of getting accurate information but already the difference between 1 and 5 and 1 and 157 that's not simply a different way of measuring it that requires a great degree of willful ignorance and misleading of the public to imply that your weapons are that accurate against the eyewitness testimony of people in that region those who have lost family members and friends in that region recently there was video put up of supposed bomb-making factory that was bombed and the New York Times talked to the people who had lived in that building they were civilian homes it was not a factory and that's just one of literally hundreds that have been identified as not being what the military has initially said they were when they were bombed I think if you were to extrapolate that from what do we say 466 civilians killed that's what the coalition is saying right so in that period if you they say 31 times more than that or at least 31 times more we killed civilians in a strike the way now so it's possible that they're killed 31 times as many civilians yeah I mean air wars says it's at least thousands in that region during the 15,000 if that were near it now yeah air wars says lower but they also say again it's so difficult to get accurate information so possible as many times 30 times 466 yeah is a 13,000 984 teen thousand civilians not 466 civilians and maybe maybe that then you know I know that numbers true either but it suggests that we're looking at a five digit number or a high four digit number and not a mid three digit number yeah which both means that they are killing far far more civilians than they've said but also that they're killing far fewer Isis members and we're related back briefly to the last story because we don't even talk about every we've run into the same problem because it's so far out of the of the regular conversation that we have about taxes and tax cuts and funding the government but you know we just passed another military spending bill with huge Democratic support right and it didn't really even get debated yeah I don't have it spending more than Trump had even requested right we just spend spend spend on these we'll spend on what kills people we will not spend on what saves people and I'm not I'm not suggesting that we not have a military I'd like us to get out of these wars I think that overall if we didn't participate in these wars we would see a stunningly different kind of American foreign policy there would be some downsides no question but the fact that we don't as a country think what was the bill do you know off the top of your head with the military's firming with the authorization 6:44 I was gonna I thought it was 700 bill yeah maybe was the president asked for 644 in the game I thought was 800 but maybe you guys are also 700 billion what else I mean that we don't even have a conversation of what if we gave them 400 billion yeah right you know and this 425 billion to go around the world every by the way you know and by the way I'm not signing you to a one-year card we do this like every year it's not like if you only spent 200 billion dollars this year then you've got a real crappy military we already have all this stuff right we obviously there's maintenance and pay and all of that we obviously as a percentage of our whatever you call it gross domestic and more on the military than anybody else and not just far as we can but we spend as a percentage we spend more than anybody else and and and we don't have a conversation about whether we need to that's marginalized to barbara Lee right you know she's the person who talks about that Oh partially she voted against the war in Afghanistan right we don't have a meaningful conversation among and that when when people who are to our left make that point I find them to be 100 percent correct they're just right as can be that somehow the Democratic Party has not at any point stood up at a meaningful way and a leader at the way the way the leadership of the party should or the way you'd hope they would have and questioned whether it's okay because they're afraid that they'll be called soft and so or they believe it or maybe they do and like you know more so even than guns or any of these lobbies the raw facts of the way the House of Representatives is made up is it's made up of people who represent districts right mccr and republic republican where the military is such a big part of the economy and they're just and they've helped to create that in the mills don't they perfectly they created it with this goal in mind and a lot of like if you if you talk to regular people man they mostly think we should be spending more they couldn't tell you if it's seven hundred billion a year or 100 billion a year but they know it should be higher yeah it's weird how that works out the wall - we should but I want to talk about so we're talking about this increased civilian casualty rate and here is a case study of how terrible this is not just objectively but directly in comparison to the Isis occupation that has been ongoing in this area during the two years that Isis ruled downtown Cleora an area of about one square mile there were 40 airstrikes 13 of which killed 43 civilians 19 men eight women and 16 children in the same period according to the Iraqi Federal Police Isis executed 18 civilians and so far more people were actually dying from the airstrikes then from the Isis occupation now that doesn't mean that of course there aren't tons of other you consequences of Isis being in that area but in sheer blood we are strike smells worse and let's be clear about what we're saying because they're gonna be you know the clowns out there who listen to this show are gonna suggest that we're equated States military and Isis right and they're we're worse we're nearly three times more deadly than they are which would appear in that town we are the question is what's the result I mean first of all there's the ownership of that what does it mean that we killed 43 people who were innocent who's whose only crime was that they were terrorized by the most terrifying and awful people on the planet right or among the most terrifying and awful people on the planet I mean Isis like that their lives were ruined by Isis until we dropped a bomb on it and they'll wait it can get worse right so we have to take ownership of that and there's a moral responsibility there which we don't we're not interested as a people to examine but then of course what we talk about frequently what we pay a price for that there's a tangible effect that that has like what and do we spend a lot of time thinking about that we spent a lot of time talking about it I don't know that we spent a lot of time thinking what does it mean because that again as we often say there was 43 people there were they had a hundred and thirty seven children and they had and some of them were children of course and and they had wives and they have uncles and they have cousins and those are all people who many of whom now will hate America right and see America as a killer from the sky right so I I don't know what the solution is but I I know that we ought to be talking about that and we're gonna be talking about an incredibly meaningful way in the same way we ought to have meaningful conversation about what we spend on the military yeah I've said it before I wanna say one more time and it's a bizarre idea and I'm willing to accept modifications to it but I think especially considering the fact that the Senate in the house looked like they're not going to accomplish anything for the rest of until the midterms so I think we can set aside six months where we have this is there gonna be the biggest thing like it in the history of our country six months of hearings where the heads of the military and the the corporations that supply it go in every day it's on TV and we go through on a map every single country where we have soldiers and bases and the military makes the case for why we have to continue that now we go through the top 100 expenses of the military the programs the exercises all of that and they make the case directly to the American public why we need to be in these places and why we need to be funding these programs because as long as it's cloaked behind and we're out there we've got a lot of stuff we need a lot of stuff I don't think people really realize how big the numbers are but when we're talking about why the hell do we have 700 soldiers in this African country nobody even knows exists why why are we doing that I think between 40 of a year to it three and five thousand on the British island of Diego Garcia off of Mauritius near Africa I mean what percentage of the American public knows that yeah very very few and they should know that max to the three people at this table I'll tell you that right now anyway I think that that would be a great exercise for our country to finally spend a significant amount of time both on the government side and our personal side in the media coming to grips with the military Empire that we have developed and whether certain parts of it could perhaps be curtailed help us build independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network comm / join
