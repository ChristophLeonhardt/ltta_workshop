so as a lot of you know Sarah could be Sanders the spokesperson for Donald Trump went to a restaurant called red hen she was asked to leave by the owner of the restaurant that's caused a lot of controversy Donald Trump took a long time to back up his press secretary and there might be a good reason for that New York Times reporting that he is now dissatisfied with her he thinks that she should have walked out of the White House Correspondents Dinner when Michelle wolf was making fun of her and so now he's being the face she's weak oh he's the worst and he is apparently saying that he'll start to grade her performances how demeaning and debasing but he did put out a tweet which I found to be curious slash mental of 48 hours after the incident here's what he said the Red Hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canapes doors and windows badly needs a paint job rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders I always had a rule if a restaurant is dirty on the outside it is dirty on the inside okay let's just note for the record that he barely defends Sarah Huckabee Sanders there instead he's obsessed with attacking this restaurant and their canapes let's also note for the record that he's the President of the United States we have a deeply unstable person as president all right but as I read that I thought oh I hope somebody does a story on his restaurants and thank you having the posts they step up to do that and Mary pappenphus with an excellent story on how clean Donald Trump's facilities are on the inside so let's find out she writes his establishments have racked up scores of violations including for several critical issues such as fly and cockroach infestations food stored at improper temperatures and dirty conditions that's interesting that appears to be dirty on the inside and I know how Donald Trump says that immigrants actually human beings are infesting America it turns out actually it's his restaurants that are infested with actual cockroaches and flies let's get more specific in April of this year so this is happening now these are not long ago stories inspectors ding dong International Hotel in Washington DC on nine food health issues but only nine it was written up for unsanitary food contact services improper food holding temperatures and improper storage to prevent cross-contamination among other problems well that's probably the only one I mean that's a mess he's not winning with that restaurant nine different violations no wonder he doesn't like regulations then he might have to serve you food that isn't going to make you sick well that might cost him an extra nickel it's gonna cost you a lot more if you eat there so now let's go back just a couple years to 2015 and 2015 Trump cafe and grill was cited also for nine health violations is that separate one than the one we just told you about six were deemed critical and included dirty food contact services dirty wiping cloths and cold food stored in an improper temperature the following year was cited for five violations three critical including roach infestation it was cited for four critical violations last year and for three so far this year so from 2015 to this year a mountain of health violations it appears Trump's properties are dirty on the inside I'm not done yet well now we go to his beloved mar-a-lago I mean suckers pay $200,000 initiation for you to go to Mara Lago and then they have to pay annual dues of $14,000 plus whatever highway robbery is happening inside that organization so if you're paying that much it must be sparkling clean right as you can see no not remotely look at the filth the Trump is a wallowing in Trump's restaurant at mar-a-lago was cited for 13 health violations last year including for undercooked fish and hot raw meat that sounds uncomfortable just these before Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a had dinner there the restaurant chalked up a combined seventy eight health code violations in just three years what was it that Donald Trump said he was really concerned about all right being dirty on the inside have you ever seen anything describe a human being better than that phrase about Donald Trump unsurprising his restaurants and facilities are absolutely filthy they're disgusting and anyone who pays money to go there I want to have their head examined let alone the idiots who go to Mara Lago and give $200,000 to eat food that is potentially contaminated and it's 78 else code violations you want to talk about the redhead that's what you want talk about Donald Trump two easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
