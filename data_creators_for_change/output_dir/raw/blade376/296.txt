understand you know each other through

137
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,969
interpretation and everyone's different

<font color="#E5E5E5">what I want to meet this person through</font>

155
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,090
them there as if I'm getting down the

156
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,770
street even if they do live at the other

157
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,599
side the world like the case here so

158
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:02,759
I've met all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys do it awesome</font>

159
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,220
and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given me good company Plus Ryan</font>

160
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,289
he's not here where's Ryan<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

161
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:12,629
I'll work in<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly we are tightly</font>

162
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:15,240
people should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more faith the</font>

163
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident with the goal that originally</font>

164
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,509
to come and see you know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

165
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,039
said learn a lesson from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bone trust</font>

166
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,139
people in the internet it's not always

167
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:24,150
like that it's the equivalent of if you

168
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,340
go to a club like you're here because

169
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it exactly ss trust and</font>

170
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's with relationships if you go to a</font>

171
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,140
club and you meet someone there and he

172
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,950
gives you if it's a girl and a guy gives

173
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,289
you his number you're putting trust in

174
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,880
there and if that went wrong that's the

175
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,500
equivalent of saying like this it's just

176
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the distance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is greater so</font>

177
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,010
therefore take more precaution so you

178
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:48,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">just got to assess a situation and if</font>

179
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:49,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the right precautions</font>

180
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,660
everything should work out all right and

181
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,339
I think I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> made a good judgment and</font>

182
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,310
I've had an amazing week so I'm sorry

185
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,160
