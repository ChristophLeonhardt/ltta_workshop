the son of Lebanese immigrants to Brazil could not be more different than the left-wing legend whose place he is running for president of Latin America's largest country less than a month ago former Sao Paolo mayor Fernando Haddad was Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's running mate a soft-spoken academic by the side of the popular and charismatic former president but with Lula now barred from running as he serves a 12-year sentence for corruption Haddad has been forced to step into his shoes if he can we have received a mission from President Lula a mission to look into the eyes of the people and remind them of the time when together we built a very different country Haddad was Lulu's Education Minister he promises to return to the days when the Workers Party implemented social programs have lifted millions of Brazilians from poverty that memory has helped transfer some of Lula's popularity to Haddad especially on the industrial outskirts of Sao Paulo where the Workers Party or PT was born the PT is the party of the working class that gave us dignity before the PT who had no access to credit cards we always took busses never an airplane Charlie Remo dice doesn't know much about her dad only whom he represents moving Haddad's biggest strength is also his biggest weakness he needs in support of these workers who are part of Lola's hardcore support base but that means he can't distance himself from a former president who millions of other Brazilians identify with his country's worst ever corruption scandal Haddad himself is under investigation for taking illegal campaign contributions in 2012 a charge he denies and although he's regarded as a moderate within his left-wing party it's a hard sell yo entiendo que da genome where is I think Haddad is no fool and would not be a toy in the hands of his mentor but right now he needs to stick to Lula's image to make it to the second round but as his followers chant Lula is Haddad and had daddy's Lula the unlikely candidate has little time to convince the undecided that he wouldn't be the puppet of an imprisoned former president you see a Newman al-jazeera Sao Paulo
