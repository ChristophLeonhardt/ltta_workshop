MOST JOURNALISTS LEAN LEFT, OR

3
00:00:13,412 --> 00:00:15,481

11
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:25,625
HOW INDEPENDENT IS THE

00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,928
WHITE HOUSE PRESS CORPS THAT IS

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,296
SO OVERWHELMINGLY LEFTIST?

14
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,464
HOW CAN IT BE INDEPENDENT?

15
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,432
HOW COMMITTED TO FREE SPEECH AS

16
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,967
A GROUP THAT ONLY INVITES

17
00:00:34,967 --> 00:00:36,903
COMEDIANS TO THEIR MARQUEE

18
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,938

23
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:48,781
FLEISCHER, GEORGE W. BUSH'S

FIRST PRESS SECRETARY.

25
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:51,183
GREAT IS THE ALL OF YOU TONIGHT.

26
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:53,486
LET'S START WITH YOU, ARI.

27
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,087
DID YOU GO TO THE DINNER?

28
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:55,755
YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T GO.

29
00:00:55,755 --> 00:00:57,890
YOU'VE BEEN TO ENOUGH OF THOSE.

30
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,460
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN TO ONE OF

31
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,129
THOSE -- I'M HAPPY TO REPORT.

32
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:03,896
>> Laura: WHAT WAS YOUR

33
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:05,031
REACTION WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED

34
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:09,268
SEEING THE CLIPS ROLE IN?

35
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:11,070
>> FRANKLY, LAURA, UNTIL I SAW

36
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,672
IT ON YOUR SHOW, I HAD NO IDEA

37
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,906
HOW VULGAR IT WAS REALLY WAS.

38
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:15,274
I HATE SEEING A LOT OF THE

39
00:01:15,274 --> 00:01:17,209
EXCERPTS, THINGS THAT WERE SAID

40
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:18,144
ABOUT KELLYANNE, THINGS THAT

41
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:23,049
WERE SAID ABOUT SARAH HOW COULD

42
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,450
COULD -- BUT I DID NOT KNOW HOW

43
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,151
BAD IT WAS.

44
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,853
A REAL PROBLEM HERE IS THE

45
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:28,921
PRICES KILLING THEMSELVES.

46
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:29,855
THEY JUST DON'T GET IT.

47
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:31,223
THEY ARE AN INDUSTRY IN DECLINE

48
00:01:31,223 --> 00:01:32,725
AND THEY ARE IN DECLINE BECAUSE

49
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,860
HALF OF AMERICA, THE

50
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,561
CONSERVATIVE HALF, DOES NOT

51
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,697
TRUST THEM.

52
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,665
EVENTS LIKE THIS JUST MAKE IT

53
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:40,967
WORSE AND THE PRESS STILL

54
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,435
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HOW BAD LAST

55
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:42,802
NIGHT WAS.

56
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:45,304
WHEN YOU HEAR JUAN WILLIAMS

57
00:01:45,304 --> 00:01:47,573
DEFENDED, WHEN YOU HEAR ONE OF

58
00:01:47,573 --> 00:01:48,441
THE MOST REASONABLE LIBERALS

59
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,110
DEFENDED, AS YOU POINTED OUT,

60
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,678
LAURA, SCAN THE CROWD, THE

61
00:01:52,678 --> 00:01:53,846
LAUGHTER, THE PRESS DOESN'T GET

62
00:01:53,846 --> 00:01:54,113
IT.

63
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:57,316
>> Laura: LEE, I WANT TO GO TO

64
00:01:57,316 --> 00:01:57,683
YOU.

65
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,051
YOU ARE MY OLD EXECUTIVE

66
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,453
PRODUCER AND RADIO AND PARTNER

67
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,455
IN CRIME 17 YEARS AGO, BACK TO

68
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:03,122
LAW SCHOOL.

69
00:02:03,122 --> 00:02:05,091
LEE, IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO PLAY A

70
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,692
LOT OF THESE SOUND BITES

71
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:07,293
TONIGHT.

72
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,794
YOU SAID, A LOT OF PEOPLE DIDN'T

73
00:02:08,794 --> 00:02:10,363
SEE THIS, THEY HAVE TO SEE JUST

74
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,033
HOW VULGAR AND FLOW IT WAS TO

75
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:18,304
UNDERSTAND HOW FAR WE'VE SUNK

76
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,038
WITH THE MEDIA AND THE SO-CALLED

77
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,373
DEFENSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

78
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,707
THE DOUBLE STANDARD HERE IS

79
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,775
GLARING FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO

80
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:25,077
SEE IT, ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF

81
00:02:25,077 --> 00:02:26,879
WOMEN, THE ME TOO MOVEMENT, "I

82
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,615
AM WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR," ALL OF

83
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:29,915
THAT.

84
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:32,518
>> WHAT'S FUNNY, LAURA, FOR THE

85
00:02:32,518 --> 00:02:33,719
LAST FEW WEEKS WE'VE HEARD THE

86
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,087
PRESS EXCORIATED FOR LACK OF

87
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:35,788
VETTING BY THE WHITE HOUSE.

88
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,057
THEY DIDN'T DO A PROPER JOB WITH

89
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,525
THE VETERANS AFFAIRS GENTLEMAN

90
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:40,926
WHO WAS ULTIMATELY DISMISSED AND

91
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:42,695
YET THEY COULD NOT BUT THIS

92
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:43,763
COMEDIAN?

93
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,131
DON'T THEY HAVE YOUTUBE?

94
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,499
DON'T THEY HAVE GOOGLE?

95
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,333
CAN'T THEY WATCH THIS WOMAN'S

96
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,269
PERFORMANCE ON "THE DAILY SHOW"?

97
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:52,872
WHAT IS FASCINATING, LAURA, WHAT

98
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,840
JUAN WILLIAMS MUST COME AND 95%

99
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,708
OF JOKES WERE IN BETTER

100
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,108
REPUBLICANS.

101
00:02:56,108 --> 00:02:59,278
SHE DID NOT SPREAD IT AROUND.

102
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:02,281
SHE TARGETED MOSTLY WOMEN.

103
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:02,915
67 MINUTES STRAIGHT, VILE,

104
00:03:02,915 --> 00:03:05,451
REPULSIVE JOKES, THEY WERE

105
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:06,685
AIMED AT WOMEN.

106
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:07,353
THESE WERE NOT JUST JOKES.

107
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,456
IT WAS LIKE A PUBLIC SHAMING.

108
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,058
IT WAS JUST DISGRACEFUL.

109
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:14,994
TO LISTEN TO THE AUDIENCE LAUGH,

110
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,762
AND WE WISH WE COULD SEE WHO WAS

111
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:18,964
LAUGHING AND AT WHAT, BECAUSE

112
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,233
THESE JOKES WERE DISGRACEFUL,

113
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:22,701
AND THE LAUGHS CONTINUED AND

114
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,169
THEY CONTINUED.

115
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,804
ON THE KEY HERE, LAURA, THERE

116
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,272
WAS A WINNER HERE.

117
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,506
THEY WERE TWO WINNERS.

118
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:29,075
ONE WAS A COMEDIAN BECAUSE MY

119
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,509
GOODNESS, SHE'S GOING TO GET A

120
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,878
REALLY BIG DEAL WITH HBO.

121
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:33,646
SHE'LL BE FOLLOWING BILL MAHER

122
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:34,713
IN THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.

123
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:37,716
SHE WAS PLAYING TO HER AUDIENCE,

124
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:38,417
ILLIBERAL SET OF JOURNALISTS,

125
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,152
AND TRUMP, BY THE WAY, WAS A

126
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:42,421
WINNER TO COME OF THE SMARTEST

127
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:44,256
MAN NOT IN THE ROOM.

128
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,692
HE WAS PLAYING TO HIS AUDIENCE,

129
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:47,193
AMERICA, AMERICA.

130
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:48,394
>> Laura: JEFFREY LORD, YOU

131
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,696
WROTE A PIECE FOR "THE

132
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:51,363
SPECTATOR" ABOUT THIS.

133
00:03:51,363 --> 00:03:53,732
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT

134
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,601
THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND BEATING

135
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,036
BACK THOSE WHO WOULD WANT TO

136
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,437
INTIMIDATE PEOPLE FROM SPEAKING

137
00:03:58,437 --> 00:04:00,573
OUT ON ANY ISSUE, YET THERE WAS

138
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,576
SOMETHING DESPERATELY MISSING AT

139
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,078
SATURDAY NIGHT'S DINNER.

140
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,647
>> THAT'S RIGHT, FIRST I HAVE TO

141
00:04:08,647 --> 00:04:10,216
TELL YOU, BREAKING NEWS, THE

142
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,684
FEDERAL ELECTIONS COMMISSION IS

143
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,119
STARTING TO INVESTIGATE THE

144
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:14,687
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS

145
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,288
ASSOCIATION FOR A MULTIMILLION

146
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,189
DOLLAR CONTRIBUTION TO THE TRUMP

147
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,425
CAMPAIGN IN 2020.

148
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,827
YOU SEE THESE CLUBS THAT YOU

149
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:24,497
PLAY, ALL THROUGH THE ELECTION

150
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,464
SEASON, I GUARANTEE.

151
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,100
>> Laura: LET'S GO THROUGH

152
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,635
2018, FIRST, JEFFREY.

153
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:31,070
>> [LAUGHS]

154
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,871
GOOD POINT.

155
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,738
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, LAURA.

156
00:04:32,738 --> 00:04:34,807
THIS IS THE KIND OF THING -- AND

157
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:38,077
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I ASKED THE

158
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,278
PRESIDENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE

159
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:39,912
CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION

160
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,147
SEVERAL DAYS AHEAD OF THE DINNER

161
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,884
WHETHER THEY WOULD SPECIFICALLY

162
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:46,085
BEAT OFFENDING CONSERVATIVES BY

163
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,687
NAME, I INCLUDED YOU,

164
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:49,388
SEAN HANNITY, KEVIN WILLIAMS,

165
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:51,457
AND I GOT NO RESPONSE.

166
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,258
TOTAL, COMPLETE SILENCE.

167
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,893
THIS IS THE SERIOUS THING HERE.

168
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,327
BASICALLY, THIS BOILS DOWN TO

169
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:57,796
FREE SPEECH FOR ME BUT NOT FOR

170
00:04:57,796 --> 00:04:59,131
THE PARADE WHEN PUSH COMES TO

171
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:02,067
SHOVE, THEY ARE NOT FAIR FOR

172
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,068
CONSERVATIVES.

173
00:05:03,068 --> 00:05:04,303
THAT IS A REAL SERIOUS PROBLEM.

174
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:05,137
YOU SEE IT NOT JUST IN

175
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:06,839
TELEVISION AND RADIO BUT YOU SEE

176
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,074
IT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

177
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:12,144
GOOD LORD, WHEN BENJI PERIO

178
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:12,878
NEEDS SERIOUS POLICE PROTECTION

179
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:14,880
AND THERE IS A RIOT TO GIVE A

180
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,349
SPEECH IN A COLLEGE CAMPUS, OR

181
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,451
ANN COULTER HAS TO CANCEL

182
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,386
SOMETHING, BECAUSE OF A THREAT

183
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,954
OF VIOLENCE, WHERE ARE THESE

184
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:22,288
PEOPLE?

185
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:25,558
THERE IS NOT A PEEP TO BE HEARD

186
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,326
FROM THEM AND IT'S DISGRACEFUL.

187
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,694
>> Laura: ARI, I WANT TO GO TO

188
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,262
YOU.

189
00:05:30,262 --> 00:05:31,130
WHETHER IT IS THIS COMEDIAN

190
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,732
RIDICULING AN ABORTION OR

191
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:36,835
TALKING ABOUT KNOCKING THE BABY

192
00:05:36,835 --> 00:05:38,237
OUT, THE FIRST DAUGHTER

193
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,974
IVANKA TRUMP IS DESCRIBED IN THE

194
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,843
MOST DISGUSTING MANNER, I THINK

195
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,312
THOSE ARE GIFTS TO AMERICANS WHO

196
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,314
MIGHT BE KIND OF -- OH, IT'S A

197
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,114
MIDTERM ELECTION CYCLE, I WANT

198
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:50,783
TO GET OUT AND VOTE.

199
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:52,184
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS TEND TO

200
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,652
ALWAYS TAKE IT TOO FAR.

201
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,654
THEY GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT AND

202
00:05:55,654 --> 00:05:56,655
THEY END UP OFFENDING PEOPLE WHO

203
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,657
MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ALL THAT

204
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:00,292
POLITICAL BUT THEY FIND THIS

205
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:00,693
GROSS.

206
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,494
THEY FIND IT'S GROSS.

207
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,265
THIS NEW MELANIA POLL, LOOKS

208
00:06:06,265 --> 00:00:00,000
LIKE 16,000 REGISTERED VOTERS
