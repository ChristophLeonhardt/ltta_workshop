we're going to have a shipping box sock
ball keep trickshot challenge it's gonna
be parents versus kids we're gonna go to
a park and we're going to try to come up
with some crazy trick shots and the
monkeys are gonna have to match it we
have a big shipping box
why shipping boxes because in the storks
movie as you know storks they are known
to deliver babies and in the movie they
no longer deliver babies and they work
for a company that does web or internet
ordering of stuff that's all we can say
that's all I'm saying we won't give it
away
and speaking of storks and babies here

Charlie fun time don't we fun time

miss that shot then they get an S and
then if they miss again
they get a team you guys Louise sort we
got to go to storks so the first one to
hit storks they don't win that's it all
right all right let's do this
all right they got it we got it that's
it okay so that was easy for the monkeys
7-foot shot that's a nice little trial
all right
mommy okay seven feet this is about
right yes BAM okay there it is nobody
got a letter so all right
monkeys do something crazier go further
oh he tried he's right it didn't work he
tried that was good that was good I have
to do the same shot and if I miss then
we got to just keep going but if I get
it they get an S all right Oh s monkey's
ass yeah we gave them a little edge they
could face towards each other because
you know we want to be a little bit fair
we don't wanna we want to beat them
right away
that's got a count
does that count the monkeys now have to
do that same trick shot and if they get
it in we get the letter monkey oh we got
we got a mess we are s so now we're tied
we both have s's this one is called the
swing o matic the swing o matic
now if the parents turn here we go s T
monkeys so now that we're in the lead
we're gonna pick the next trick shot I'm
gonna go to the top but I don't even
know what that's called
what is that I can't wrap the
contraption shot climbing the climbing
contraption shot here we go

all right the monkeys have to hit that
if they don't it's sto you did it oh
it's time to turn it up a notch I'm
getting tired
mr. monkeys gonna throw it now miss
monkey has to catch it doing the same
trick that we did if they miss it's st
old for the monkeys made you this it's a
lot harder than it looks you know no
pressure
wow we did it okay so here's the deal
I'm kicking it up even na cheer if
that's even a word I'm starting from
that same spot over the contraption and
mama B is gonna be on the other side of
the swing she's gonna catch it mama B
box mama B's like you know they're not
gonna be able to do this right I'm like
has to point the game

like a thousand meters all right ready
s T oh my mind Papa P are winning in the
lead you know it's all about winning in
this game right here well and having fun
with family that net - that's also very
important instead of the slingshots I'm
calling this the swing shot because one
person has to swing while the other
person don't we are do do it where the
our parents rule kids drool
we still love them very much because
they're so cute all right
so close sto are two more two more two
more to go two more to go this was
called a wolf horsey and I'm gonna throw
it over my shoulder and into the box
