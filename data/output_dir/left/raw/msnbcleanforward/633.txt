THEY WERE DOWN FROM 20 YEARS AGO, AND PEOPLE HAD ONE JOB.

00:00:17,585 --> 00:00:19,286
AGO, AND PEOPLE HAD ONE JOB. NOW THEY WERE WORKING TWO AND

IS THE PRESIDENT CORRECT? >> WELL, LIKE MOST THINGS IT IS

38
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,851
>> WELL, LIKE MOST THINGS IT IS NOT COMPLETELY FACTUALLY

39
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:24,185
NOT COMPLETELY FACTUALLY CORRECT.

40
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,953
CORRECT. LET’S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF CHART.

41
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,822
LET’S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF CHART. FIRST, LET’S LOOK AT THE CHART

42
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,223
FIRST, LET’S LOOK AT THE CHART OF WHAT’S HAPPENED TO NOMINAL

43
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:31,125
OF WHAT’S HAPPENED TO NOMINAL WAGES WHICH IS WAGES BEFORE YOU

44
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:32,026
WAGES WHICH IS WAGES BEFORE YOU ADJUST FOR INFLATION.

45
00:01:32,027 --> 00:01:33,561
ADJUST FOR INFLATION. WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS WHAT

46
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:35,362
WHAT YOU CAN SEE HERE IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT,

47
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:37,164
THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT, WHICH IS THIS LITTLE JIGGLE UP

48
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,899
WHICH IS THIS LITTLE JIGGLE UP THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

49
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:42,369
THESE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN HISTORICAL

50
00:01:42,404 --> 00:01:44,838
IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN HISTORICAL CONTEXT IT’S A SMALL JIGGLE.

51
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:47,775
CONTEXT IT’S A SMALL JIGGLE. THAT’S BEFORE INFLATION.

52
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,477
THAT’S BEFORE INFLATION. LET’S LOOK AT AFTER INFLATION.

53
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:50,745
LET’S LOOK AT AFTER INFLATION. WHAT YOU’LL SEE THERE IS A

54
00:01:50,746 --> 00:01:51,579
WHAT YOU’LL SEE THERE IS A DIFFERENT PICTURE.

55
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:54,081
DIFFERENT PICTURE. WHAT YOU SEE THERE, IN FACT,

56
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,383
WHAT YOU SEE THERE, IN FACT, WAGES HAVE BEEN RISING MORE

57
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:57,652
WAGES HAVE BEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY UNDER TRUMP THAN UNDER

58
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:57,985
SLOWLY UNDER TRUMP THAN UNDER OBAMA.

59
00:01:57,986 --> 00:01:59,787
OBAMA. AND THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE OF

60
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:00,154
AND THAT IS IN PART BECAUSE OF INFLATION.

61
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,490
INFLATION. SO UNDER TRUMP WAGES HAVE ONLY

62
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:04,692
SO UNDER TRUMP WAGES HAVE ONLY GONE UP, THEY WERE FLAT IN JUNE,

63
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:06,227
GONE UP, THEY WERE FLAT IN JUNE, FLAT IN JULY.

64
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:08,095
FLAT IN JULY. THEY WERE FLAT, UP A LITTLE BIT

65
00:02:08,096 --> 00:02:14,468
THEY WERE FLAT, UP A LITTLE BIT IN AUGUST BUT ALL TOLD ONLY UP

66
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,904
IN AUGUST BUT ALL TOLD ONLY UP .3% A YEAR UNDER TRUMP AS

67
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:18,005
.3% A YEAR UNDER TRUMP AS OPPOSED TO OBAMA.

68
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:19,473
OPPOSED TO OBAMA. IT’S A WORSE SITUATION THAN IT

69
00:02:19,508 --> 00:02:20,575
IT’S A WORSE SITUATION THAN IT WAS UNDER OBAMA.

70
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,410
WAS UNDER OBAMA. THEN LET’S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF

71
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:24,212
THEN LET’S LOOK AT A COUPLE OF OTHER INTERESTING THINGS.

72
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,013
OTHER INTERESTING THINGS. FIRST SOME NEW DATA THAT CAME

73
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,114
FIRST SOME NEW DATA THAT CAME OUT ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENED TO

74
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:29,317
OUT ABOUT WHAT’S HAPPENED TO DIFFERENT STRATA OF OUR SOCIETY.

75
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,453
DIFFERENT STRATA OF OUR SOCIETY. NOT SURPRISINGLY THE TOP 10% OF

76
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:33,721
NOT SURPRISINGLY THE TOP 10% OF AMERICANS HAVE ACTUALLY DONE

77
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:36,591
AMERICANS HAVE ACTUALLY DONE PRETTY WELL.

78
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:39,827
PRETTY WELL. YOU SEE THAT THE 50th

79
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,929
YOU SEE THAT THE 50th PERCENTILE, THE MEDIAN HERE --

80
00:02:41,931 --> 00:02:43,998
PERCENTILE, THE MEDIAN HERE -- YOU SEE THE TOP HAS DONE PRETTY

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,298
YOU SEE THE TOP HAS DONE PRETTY WELL.

82
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,634
WELL. YOU SEE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE

83
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,036
YOU SEE INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE BOTTOM HAS DONE PRETTY WELL.

84
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,872
BOTTOM HAS DONE PRETTY WELL. WHAT YOU ALSO SEE THE MIDDLE HAS

85
00:02:50,906 --> 00:02:51,906
WHAT YOU ALSO SEE THE MIDDLE HAS NOT DONE VERY WELL.

86
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:54,208
NOT DONE VERY WELL. THE TOP WE KNOW WHY THAT’S

87
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,542
THE TOP WE KNOW WHY THAT’S HAPPENED.

88
00:02:54,577 --> 00:02:55,943
HAPPENED. THE BOTTOM HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE

89
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:59,014
THE BOTTOM HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN

90
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:00,515
OF SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN MINIMUM WAGES BY QUITE A NUMBER

91
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:01,249
MINIMUM WAGES BY QUITE A NUMBER OF STATES.

92
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,852
OF STATES. THREAT MIDDLE CLASS, MANY WHO

93
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:05,954
THREAT MIDDLE CLASS, MANY WHO VOTED FOR TRUMP WORSE OFF OR NOT

94
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:07,555
VOTED FOR TRUMP WORSE OFF OR NOT BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE.

95
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:08,923
BETTER OFF THAN BEFORE. LASTLY ONE OTHER THING --

96
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,559
LASTLY ONE OTHER THING -- >> STEVE, LET ME STOP YOU THERE.

97
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:14,162
>> STEVE, LET ME STOP YOU THERE. THAT SOUNDS LIKE GOOD NEWS.

98
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,564
THAT SOUNDS LIKE GOOD NEWS. WE OFTEN HEAR THE RICH ARE

99
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:18,633
WE OFTEN HEAR THE RICH ARE GETTING RICHER AND THE POOR ARE

100
00:03:18,668 --> 00:03:19,768
GETTING RICHER AND THE POOR ARE GETTING POORER.

101
00:03:19,802 --> 00:03:22,104
GETTING POORER. IF YOU GO BACK TO THE OBAMA

102
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:23,672
IF YOU GO BACK TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND TO THE FIRST

103
00:03:23,673 --> 00:03:24,472
ADMINISTRATION AND TO THE FIRST 19 MONTHS OF THE TRUMP

104
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,640
19 MONTHS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, ACTUALLY

105
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:28,276
ADMINISTRATION, ACTUALLY AMERICANS OVERALL HAVE SEEN

106
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,311
AMERICANS OVERALL HAVE SEEN THEIR PROSPECTS IMPROVING, IF

107
00:03:30,346 --> 00:03:32,681
THEIR PROSPECTS IMPROVING, IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART, LOOKS

108
00:03:32,682 --> 00:03:33,782
YOU LOOK AT THAT CHART, LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN IMPROVING

109
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:36,184
LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN IMPROVING QUITE A BIT, THE 90% OVER THE

110
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,552
QUITE A BIT, THE 90% OVER THE PAST EIGHT, NINE YEARS.

111
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,654
PAST EIGHT, NINE YEARS. >> YES, OVER THE PAST EIGHT,

112
00:03:39,656 --> 00:03:43,658
>> YES, OVER THE PAST EIGHT, NINE YEARS THE TOP 10% OF

113
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,162
NINE YEARS THE TOP 10% OF AMERICANS, 90 PERCENTILE HAVE

114
00:03:47,164 --> 00:03:47,496
AMERICANS, 90 PERCENTILE HAVE IMPROVED.

115
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,331
IMPROVED. THE BOTTOM 10% HAVE IMPROVED

116
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:51,099
THE BOTTOM 10% HAVE IMPROVED BECAUSE OF MINIMUM WAGE

117
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:52,968
BECAUSE OF MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES IN 17 STATES AND

118
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,069
INCREASES IN 17 STATES AND ANOTHER EIGHT TO COME.

119
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,571
ANOTHER EIGHT TO COME. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN

120
00:03:55,572 --> 00:03:57,673
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND ARE THE PEOPLE IN

121
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:00,309
LEFT BEHIND ARE THE PEOPLE IN THE MID TELL 50 PERCENTILE WHO

122
00:04:00,343 --> 00:04:03,011
THE MID TELL 50 PERCENTILE WHO ARE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE

123
00:04:03,013 --> 00:04:04,379
ARE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE THEY WERE BACK AT THE BEGINNING.

124
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:06,114
THEY WERE BACK AT THE BEGINNING. >> NOT TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE

125
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:07,716
>> NOT TO BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER BE

126
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:09,117
YOU KNOW I WOULD NEVER BE DIFFICULT WITH YOUR CHARTS.

127
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:10,919
DIFFICULT WITH YOUR CHARTS. BUT IF YOU START IN 2013 LOOKING

128
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:11,720
BUT IF YOU START IN 2013 LOOKING AT THE CHART.

129
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:13,355
AT THE CHART. LET’S PUT THE CHART BACK UP

130
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:13,688
LET’S PUT THE CHART BACK UP THERE.

131
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,924
THERE. IF YOU START IN 2013 AND LOOK AT

132
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,026
IF YOU START IN 2013 AND LOOK AT THOSE TREND LINES IN THE LAST

133
00:04:18,028 --> 00:04:19,228
THOSE TREND LINES IN THE LAST THREE YEARS OF THE OBAMA

134
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,195
THREE YEARS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND THE FIRST

135
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,499
ADMINISTRATION AND THE FIRST YEAR AND A HALF OF THE TRUMP

136
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,733
YEAR AND A HALF OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, WOULDN’T MOST

137
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:27,269
ADMINISTRATION, WOULDN’T MOST COUNTRIES ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO

138
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:28,737
COUNTRIES ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO HAVE TRIM LINES LIKE THAT?

139
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:30,439
HAVE TRIM LINES LIKE THAT? >> OUR WAGES CERTAINLY HAVE GONE

140
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,174
>> OUR WAGES CERTAINLY HAVE GONE UP BY MORE THAN THEY HAVE IN

141
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:34,143
UP BY MORE THAN THEY HAVE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT ONE, YOU’RE

142
00:04:34,177 --> 00:04:35,778
OTHER COUNTRIES, BUT ONE, YOU’RE COMING OFF THIS BOTTOM DOWN HERE

143
00:04:35,812 --> 00:04:37,413
COMING OFF THIS BOTTOM DOWN HERE AT THE DEPTHS OF THE RECESSION.

144
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,914
AT THE DEPTHS OF THE RECESSION. SO YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO

145
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,648
SO YOU OBVIOUSLY ARE GOING TO CLIMB BACK.

146
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:40,950
CLIMB BACK. WHEN THE DUST SETTLES FROM

147
00:04:40,984 --> 00:04:43,019
WHEN THE DUST SETTLES FROM BEGINNING TO END, THE TOP AND

148
00:04:43,053 --> 00:04:45,020
BEGINNING TO END, THE TOP AND BOTTOM HAVE DONE REASONABLY

149
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:45,454
BOTTOM HAVE DONE REASONABLY WELL.

150
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:48,424
WELL. UP A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS OFTEN

151
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:48,724
UP A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS OFTEN YEARS.

152
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:49,758
YEARS. NOT A LOT.

153
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,261
NOT A LOT. THE MIDDLE HAS GOTTEN BACK TO

154
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:54,363
THE MIDDLE HAS GOTTEN BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE IN 2009 AT A

155
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:56,165
WHERE THEY WERE IN 2009 AT A TIME WHEN THE STOCK MARKET HAS

156
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:56,832
TIME WHEN THE STOCK MARKET HAS ROUGHLY DOUBLED.

157
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:59,368
ROUGHLY DOUBLED. YOU TELL ME WHO THE INNERS AND

158
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,737
YOU TELL ME WHO THE INNERS AND LOSERS ARE THERE.

159
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:03,873
LOSERS ARE THERE. I HAVE ONE MORE CHART IF YOU

160
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:06,876
I HAVE ONE MORE CHART IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT

161
00:05:06,877 --> 00:05:08,311
WANT TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT TRUMP’S CLAIM PEOPLE HOLDING

162
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:08,945
TRUMP’S CLAIM PEOPLE HOLDING MULTIPLE JOBS.

163
00:05:08,946 --> 00:05:10,880
MULTIPLE JOBS. I KNOW THE PUBLIC NARRATIVE IS

164
00:05:10,881 --> 00:05:12,281
I KNOW THE PUBLIC NARRATIVE IS THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE HOLDING
