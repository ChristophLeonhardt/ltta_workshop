we Christian conservatives are very often accused of trying to impose our religion on others of trying to push our religion no matter what the topic is no matter what we're talking about it always comes back to that our opponent is always going to accuse us in the end of your trying to push your religion on me and this will even happen when they're the first ones to bring up religion so I don't know how many times I've had a conversation like this where I'm I'm talking often to a liberal and they'll say well you know the Bible and Jesus agree with me on this topic I mean Jesus said himself that he agrees with me on whatever topic we're talking about and then I'll say well no he doesn't and in fact here are a couple verses that prove and then he'll say stop pushing your religion on me why do you bring up religion all the time I didn't you did so there's this weird thing that liberals do well they're they they will try to use their first tactic is to try to use my religion against me and when that doesn't work then they'll claim that religion has nothing to do with it and we should be talking about religion so this is this is the way it usually goes
