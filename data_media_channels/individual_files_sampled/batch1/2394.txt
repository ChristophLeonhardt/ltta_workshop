I'm gonna be totally blunt are you guys in 401ks okay your informal case I honestly think you just take your money at a 401k this is what it's actually happening at a 401k you have no idea what's happening to your money and by the way if you want that money back before the age of 65 which is 45 years from now you have to pay a huge penalty they're doing whatever they want with your money they're investing it wherever they want they're paying themselves salaries in most mutual funds they're putting it in in marketing fees hold on to your money put your money in your bank account I mean the average 401k they won't really tell you this probably returns like one half percent per year you don't really make money in the 401k it's just tax deferred when you're in your 20s what does tax deferred even mean like you're not gonna see the money anyway one way or the other for 45 years you're not even 45 years old what you should do in your 20s and 30s is invest in yourself building on multiple sources of income investing on getting greater skills and so on that's how you make money in your 20s and 30s
