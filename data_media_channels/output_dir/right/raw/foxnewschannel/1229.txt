1
00:00:08,832 --> 00:00:11,802
>> NOT ONLY ABSOLUTELY GREAT

2
00:00:11,802 --> 00:00:12,135
NUMBER.

3
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:13,503
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST

4
00:00:13,503 --> 00:00:14,438
MONTHLY NUMBERS I HAVE EVER

5
00:00:14,438 --> 00:00:15,739
SEEN FOR BLACK PEOPLE, EVER.

6
00:00:15,739 --> 00:00:17,207
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR

7
00:00:17,207 --> 00:00:19,609
BLACK PEOPLE WENT FROM 6.6

8
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:20,577
TO 5.9%.

9
00:00:20,577 --> 00:00:22,212
ABSOLUTELY THE LOWEST EVER.

10
00:00:22,212 --> 00:00:24,314
BUT, HERE'S THE KICKER.

11
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:26,516
LABOR PARTICIPATION, 76,000

12
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:30,654
BLACKS CAME INTO THE LABOR

13
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:31,388
MARK.

14
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:32,990
EVERY OTHER RACE SAW PEOPLE

15
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,258
LEAVE THE LABOR MARK.

16
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:37,127
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE

17
00:00:37,127 --> 00:00:37,627
STUFF.

18
00:00:37,627 --> 00:00:38,195
PETE: HISTORIC NUMBERS

19
00:00:38,195 --> 00:00:39,229
COMING IN YESTERDAY.

20
00:00:39,229 --> 00:00:42,499
HERE TO REACT CANDACE OWENS

21
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:43,633
TURNING POINT U.S.A.

22
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:44,601
YOU CONTINUE TO HIT THE

23
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:45,969
TRAIL TO AMAZING CROWDS

24
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:47,204
WHICH I SEE ONLINE.

25
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:47,771
WELL DONE.

26
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:49,039
>> THANK YOU.

27
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:49,873
PETE: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

28
00:00:49,873 --> 00:00:52,009
NUMBERS HISTORICALLY LOW

29
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,511
OVERALL BUT FOR BLACKS.

30
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,579
>> WONDERFUL NEWS.

31
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:56,546
CANNOT BE OVERSTATED WHAT

32
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:57,614
THIS PRESIDENT HAS DONE FOR

33
00:00:57,614 --> 00:00:58,849
THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

34
00:00:58,849 --> 00:00:59,783
HOPE IS INSPIRING AND

35
00:00:59,783 --> 00:01:00,717
ECONOMIC GROWTH HE HAS

36
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:02,085
INSPIRED WITHIN THIS

37
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:02,419
COUNTRY.

38
00:01:02,419 --> 00:01:04,054
I HAVE HEARD ANTJUAN SAY IN

39
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:05,756
THE LAST SEGMENT THANK YOU

40
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:06,089
OBAMA.

41
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:07,324
THAT'S A DELUSIONAL COMMENT.

42
00:01:07,324 --> 00:01:08,525
EITHER HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

43
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:09,359
ECONOMIC POLICY OR HE

44
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:10,193
DOESN'T WANT TO.

45
00:01:10,193 --> 00:01:13,196
BUT THIS IS DIRECTLY

46
00:01:13,196 --> 00:01:14,031
CORRELATED TO THE WORK HE

47
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,198
HAS DONE TO SHRINK

48
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:16,433
GOVERNMENT AND TO SLASH

49
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,135
REGULATIONS AND I'M JUST SO

50
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:19,202
PROUD AND IT'S A GREAT TIME

51
00:01:19,202 --> 00:01:20,303
TO BE A BLACK AMERICAN.

52
00:01:20,303 --> 00:01:22,606
I WILL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

53
00:01:22,606 --> 00:01:23,473
ABBY: WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE

54
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:23,774
DONE.

55
00:01:23,774 --> 00:01:24,875
>> HE NEEDS TO CONTINUE DOWN

56
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,076
THE SAME PATH HE IS ON.

57
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,644
BEST THING WE CAN DO IS GET

58
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:28,578
THE MESSAGE OUT THERE TO THE

59
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:29,146
BLACK COMMUNITY.

60
00:01:29,146 --> 00:01:30,280
WHEN YOU SEE THAT THAT'S WHY

61
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,382
WHEN I GETDOWN SET WHEN

62
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:33,683
SOMEONE LIKE ANTJUAN SAYS

63
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:34,985
THANK YOU, OBAMA.

64
00:01:34,985 --> 00:01:36,019
AND PRETENDS THIS IS NOT

65
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:36,686
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT

66
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:38,855
HAS DONE.

67
00:01:38,855 --> 00:01:40,157
PETE: RACIST AND RACIST

68
00:01:40,157 --> 00:01:41,591
POLICY HOW DO YOU BRIDGE

69
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:41,892
THAT.

70
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:43,960
>> DESTROY THE LEFT'S

71
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,394
RHETORIC.

72
00:01:44,394 --> 00:01:45,729
THEY USE FEAR POLITICKING TO

73
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:47,531
STRAP BLACK PEOPLE INTO THIS

74
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:48,465
HELPLESSNESS AND TO MORE

75
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:49,166
FOOD STAMPS.

76
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,767
THEY SAY THAT'S A PLUS.

77
00:01:50,767 --> 00:01:51,068
RIGHT?

78
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:52,069
BUT BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT,

79
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,769
THAT'S A LOW.

80
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:53,904
THEN WHEN THEY ACKNOWLEDGE

81
00:01:53,904 --> 00:01:55,238
IT'S A POSITIVE, THEY SAY

82
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,206
THAT'S BECAUSE OF OBAMA

83
00:01:56,206 --> 00:01:57,841
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT

84
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:58,508
BLACK INDIVIDUALS AREN'T

85
00:01:58,508 --> 00:02:00,043
SMART ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND

86
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:02,813
ECONOMIC POLICY.

87
00:02:02,813 --> 00:02:03,547
ABBY: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

88
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:06,249
HAVE SEEN.

89
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:06,783
PETE: POWERFUL.

90
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:07,484
ABBY: SOME OF OUR TEASES ON

91
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:08,518
THE SHOW WE WANTED TO ASK

92
00:02:08,518 --> 00:02:10,954
YOU PARTICULARLY ABOUT THIS.

93
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:12,122
STUDENTS WERE ASKED WHO THEY

94
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,291
WOULD RATHER GANG AN -- THIS

95
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,159
IS NOT A JOKE, AN MS-13 GANG

96
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:17,828
MEMBER OR TRUMP SUPPORTER.

97
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:18,962
WATCH HOW THIS PLAYED OUT.

98
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:20,564
>> OH, GANG MEMBER.

99
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:21,965
>> GIVE ME THE GANG MEMBER.

100
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:24,334
>> I'M GOING TO GO MS-13.

101
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:25,802
>> YEAH.

102
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:26,736
PROBABLY MS-13 MEMBER.

103
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:28,738
>> NEITHER.

104
00:02:28,738 --> 00:02:29,773
I WILL STAY SINGLE.

105
00:02:29,773 --> 00:02:31,808
>> I GUESS A TRUMP SUPPORTER

106
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,477
BECAUSE I GUESS AT LEAST

107
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:34,344
THEY STAND FOR SOMETHING.

108
00:02:34,344 --> 00:02:35,712
>> WHY AN MS-13 MEMBER.

109
00:02:35,712 --> 00:02:37,747
>> I LIVED IN BOLIVIA I

110
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:38,415
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT OF

111
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:38,849
THE CULTURE.

112
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,151
>> A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS

113
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:44,221
WERE PROBABLY RAISED BY RICH

114
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:45,522
WHITE DADS AND HAVE LOTS OF

115
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,224
MONEY AND BREAD INTO BEING

116
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:47,858
TRUMP SUPPORTERS.

117
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:49,693
>> ONE TRUMP SUPPORTER THEY

118
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:50,660
WOULD DATE BECAUSE AT LEAST

119
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,761
HE STANDS FOR SOMETHING.

120
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:53,396
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED

121
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:53,797
WHATSOEVER.

122
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:55,065
LIKE YOU SAID, IT'S NOT A

123
00:02:55,065 --> 00:02:55,365
JOKE.

124
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:56,566
WE CON FRONT THIS ALL THE

125
00:02:56,566 --> 00:02:57,801
TIME ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

126
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,269
THERE IS A DEPARTURE FROM

127
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,071
REALITY THAT IS GOING ON.

128
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,472
ABBY: DO THEY KNOW WHAT AN

129
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:02,839
MS-13 IS.

130
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,840
>> THEY DO KNOW.

131
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,208
THEY KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS

132
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:05,542
RAPE.

133
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:06,710
THEY KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS

134
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,010
KILL.

135
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,512
WE SAW THEY DEFENDED THESE

136
00:03:08,512 --> 00:03:09,513
INDIVIDUALS AGAINST BEING

137
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:10,780
CALLED ANIMALS BUT THEY ARE

138
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,982
VERY HAPPY WHEN TRUMP

139
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,150
SUPPORTERS ARE CALLED

140
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,417
RACISTS AND SEXIST AND A

141
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:17,287
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT NAMES.

142
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,422
AND THIS IS DIRECTLY LEANS

143
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,258
TO THE LEFT RHETORIC AND THE

144
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:24,161
LEFT WHICH PERPETUATE THIS.

145
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,529
THERE IS MASSIVE

146
00:03:25,529 --> 00:03:26,229
BRAINWASHING THEY ARE TRYING

147
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:27,664
TO DO AND REINFORCING.

148
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:30,500
WE SEE THIS ALL THE TIME.

149
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,468
ABBY: ROSEANNE BAR LAST WEEK

150
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:32,969
YEAH THERE MAY BE A DOUBLE

151
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:33,336
STANDARD.

152
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:34,171
THE HATE SPEECH IS ACROSS

153
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,539
THE BOARD AND A PROBLEM WE

154
00:03:35,539 --> 00:03:36,973
HAVE RIGHT NOW AND AS A

155
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:37,941
COUNTRY GOT TO FIGURE OUT

156
00:03:37,941 --> 00:03:39,176
HOW TO STOP ALL THE HATE.

157
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,477
>> THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TRYING

158
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:40,944
TO DO.

159
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:42,312

TRUMP.

170
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,624
CAN YOU BE A LITTLE MORE

171
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:55,292
REALISTIC IN TERMS OF THE

RICH WHITE MAN.

178
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:04,234
>> IRS NOT RAISED BY A RICH

179
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:06,369
WHITE MAN.

180
00:04:06,369 --> 00:04:07,304
PETE: I WANTED TO CHECK.

181
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:08,471
CHRIS MATTHEWS SAYS YOU HAVE

"WALL STREET JOURNAL."

184
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:12,475

I DO READ THE "WALL STREET
