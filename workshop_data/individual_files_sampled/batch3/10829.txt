America's former intelligence chief James clapper claims Vladimir Putin his handling Donald Trump as an asset what a great case officer Vladimir Putin is he knows how to handle an asset and that's what he's doing with the president so strong was there and joining me live to discuss this is artis caleb more peein in new york so high they caleb so can you sum it all up for us and why is the been such a strong reaction well this was a reaction to a recent speech by US president Donald Trump where he pointed out that that there was cooperation between US intelligence and Russian authorities and they were able to avert a terrorist attack in st. Petersburg and he said this was an example of good cooperation between the two countries this is Donald Trump they were able to apprehend these terrorists before the event with no loss of life and that's a great thing and the way it's supposed to work that is the way it's supposed to work so we we heard Trump say that and then we heard clapper on CNN arguing that this was not the reality now he wasn't saying that the USA shouldn't cooperate with Russia but he said that in cooperation it's a quote one way street saying that at no point does Russia ever return the favors that the USA does well the actual record does point out contrary facts in fact if one looks at what went on with the Boston bombing repeatedly Russian authorities had warned us authorities about the one of the Czar Neve brothers one of the perpetrators of that bombing had been repeatedly pointed out by Russian authorities to US officials and in fact James clapper was the director of the National Security Agency at the time that that took place so there are examples of Russia working with US authorities and helping the United States now clapper just in particular had a lot of strong opinions when it came to Russia this are some of the things that James clapper has said about Russia in the past the Russians who typically almost genetically driven to co-opt penetrate gained favor so it seems that James clapper was not happy about what Donald Trump said pointing out that cooperation between Russian and US authorities had prevented a terrorist attack in saint-petersburg and he was kind of pulling out his old spy kit and and reiterating some some of his old statements and old opinions on CNN however the record seems to point to the opposite when Russian officials repeatedly warned US officials about the xarna of brothers or one of the Tsar neve brothers bringing about some history there artis caleb mopping in new york Sankey
