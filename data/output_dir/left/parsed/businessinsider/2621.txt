like other works of art this supercar is
a limited edition only 450 of them will
ever be made bugatti calls its thousand
square meter production facility the
Atelier instead of a typical assembly
line found in most car factories the
Veyron is assembled at individual
stations here a technician unites the
transmission with the engine and
carefully bolts them together with a
handheld ratchet the mechanical
components of the car's rear section
have all been assembled technicians push
the back end along a track to meet the
front the track sits below the floor and
is covered by metal plates that open and
close around the trolley feet as they
move
the workers join the two sections with
just fourteen titanium bolts
once again they use handheld ratchets
rather than power tools
the powerful mechanics of the Veyron
have been assembled but a Bugatti is not
a Bugatti without its sculpted exterior
to bring the Veyron to its artful
conclusion technicians wear white gloves
so as not to Mar the surface with
fingerprints they install each component
with the same care and precision used
throughout
but before reaching this stage an expert
tests the cars systems at this rolling
test station these components are part
of the rear wing assembly
at high speeds the rear wing extends and
provides massive downward force to keep
the car firmly on the ground and when
the driver breaks it immediately flips
to a vertical position
adding the braking power of a hatchback
to the Cars powerful
here a specialist prepares the car for
its final inspection the car will spend
two entire days of this station as he
painstakingly buffs and polishes the car
to shining perfection he must ensure
that every centimeter of the surface is
absolutely flawless
