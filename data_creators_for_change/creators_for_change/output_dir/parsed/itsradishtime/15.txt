Hi friends.
This week I turn 27.
So I want to capture what being 26 is like.
26 has been a reconstruction.
I started the year living in my parent’s
house in WI and unemployed.
My world was my childhood bedroom.
And i felt like a total failure.
But of course, I wasn’t a failure, I just
wasn’t patient enough.
2 weeks later, moved to new york for a job.
Everything I owned fit in this trunk.
So there was this thing I used to do when
I was broke and living at home.I would imagine
what my life would be like once I could afford
to get my own place.
I had a secret pinterest board where I would
decorate my imaginary apartment and dream
of being independent.
AT 26 I like to I work, and then for fun I
work.
Or look at makeup and skincare reviews.
Or make playlists or write, which is kind
of work, but kind of art.
Slowly, I constructed a life for myself.
I went to work, I saved my money, I paid back
everything I owed my parents for helping me
move.
And Reader, I bought that bed, and that bookshelf,
and that desk, and that art, And I made my
little tiny apartment exactly how I wanted
it to be.
I built my life.
And everything that was in it was what *I*
chose.
It was mine.
I also got to go to LA, and to London, I created
some change, I made new friends at work, sometimes
a dog came to visit.
my world got bigger and bigger.
Until it started getting smaller.
At 26, I also worry—that I’m not doing
enough to make the world better.
I worry i’ve run out of stories to tell
and that no one wants to hear them anymore.
I worry that I use the word I to much.
The job I moved here for wasn’t everything
i hoped it would be.
I felt so angry and unheard.
And a friend from work gently suggested I
go back to therapy, which was a gift.
It helped me decide that I didn’t have to
let anyone make me feel so small.
So I left.
And I found another job that fit so much better.
At 26, I have the gift of a group chat to
gas me up when i needed it, a beautiful queer
family who just gets all the context of me,
and I have myself.
I have my independence.
But better still wasn’t enough.
I decided this year would be the year of asking
for what I want but I didn’t anticipate
that the answer to almost all the questions
would be no.
Even though I have been working my ass off,
and making what I thought were some of my
best videos.
See, part of my brain is a little jealous
demon that hates when other people succeed
while I’m still floundering.
I know she’s not helpful.
But I’ve just been constructing and reconstructing
my life and myself and for what?
I think maybe I need to build something else,
build something new, I just don’t know what
that is yet.
AT 26.
I secretly wish that I could be a rock star,
but more rock stars have died at 27 than have
started writing music at that age.
I feel most powerful, wearing all black, standing
on a subway platform, headphones on.
Here’s what I hope for 27.
I hope I can figure out what type of thing
I want to make next, and that people whose
opinions I care about will like that thing.
But if they don’t, I hope that won’t discourage
me.
I hope I can make myself useful in ways that
are not about me.
I hope I can worry a little less about what
opportunities that other people are getting,
and make my own.
I hope that if I take everything apart again,
I still know who I am.
Because I still believe in my potential.
And I’m going to make it something real.
