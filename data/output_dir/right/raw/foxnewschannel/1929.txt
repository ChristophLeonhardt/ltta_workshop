COMMITMENT, AND POLICIES OF

3
00:00:04,702 --> 00:00:05,903
DONALD TRUMP.

4
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:08,506
AND THAT'S "THE ANGLE."

5
00:00:08,506 --> 00:00:10,007
JOINING ME NOW REACTION IN

00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:21,252
FOX NEWS NATIONAL SECURITY

00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:21,752
ANALYST.

14
00:00:21,752 --> 00:00:23,154
GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU.

15
00:00:23,154 --> 00:00:25,256
JOHN, I WANT TO GO TO YOU ON

16
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:25,556
THIS.

17
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:27,458
IT'S AMAZING TO GO BACK AND

18
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,127
LISTEN TO THOSE WHO SEVERAL

19
00:00:29,127 --> 00:00:31,462
WEEKS AGO WERE SAYING THAT TRUMP

20
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:34,098
WAS ON THE VERGE OF BRINGING US

21
00:00:34,098 --> 00:00:35,766
A THERMONUCLEAR WAR BECAUSE HE

22
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:36,868
CALLED KIM JONG UN ROCKET MAN

23
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:39,070
AND HE SEEMED TO BE ALL OVER THE

24
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:39,370
PLACE.

25
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,404
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT'S THE

26
00:00:40,404 --> 00:00:43,274
WAY TRUMP MOVES AND OPERATES.

27
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:45,476
HE IS NOT BEING GIVEN CREDIT.

28
00:00:45,476 --> 00:00:47,912
HE SAYS LOOK, ANYTHING CAN

29
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:49,647
HAPPEN HERE BUT THE NAYSAYERS

30
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:51,749
AND THE NEGATIVITY, I DON'T

31
00:00:51,749 --> 00:00:53,351
THINK ARE COMPLYING WITH THE

32
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,785
REALITY THAT MOST AMERICANS ARE

33
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:55,186
SEEING HERE.

34
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:56,521
>> IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT

35
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,622
THAT TRUMP'S APPROACH TO

36
00:00:57,622 --> 00:00:59,490
NORTH KOREA IS NOT THE ONLY

37
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,291
PEBBLE ON THE BEACH.

38
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,627
I MEAN, NORTH KOREA HAS VERY

39
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:03,494
RECENTLY ACHIEVED WHAT IT HAS

40
00:01:03,494 --> 00:01:05,129
ALWAYS WANTED TO ACHIEVE WITH

41
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:06,164
REGARDS TO ITS NUCLEAR AND

42
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:07,565
BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAM, AND

43
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,700
THAT HAS REALLY STRENGTHENED ITS

44
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,068
BARGAINING POSITION AND GOES A

45
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:12,403
LONG WAY TO EXPAND WHY THEY

46
00:01:12,403 --> 00:01:12,970
CHANGE THEIR POSTURE.

47
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:15,339
IT'S ALSO THE CASE --

48
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:16,307
>> Laura: YOU ARE SAYING THAT

49
00:01:16,307 --> 00:01:18,276
NORTH KOREA WOULD HAVE DONE THIS

50
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:19,043
ANYWAY WITH THE HILLARY CLINTON?

51
00:01:19,043 --> 00:01:20,912
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ARGUING

52
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:23,114
QUESTION WORKS BECAUSE THERE ARE

53
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:23,714
OTHER FACTORS.

54
00:01:23,714 --> 00:01:24,382
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON

55
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:24,916
JAE-IN.

56
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:25,950
HE'S HAD ALMOST THE OPPOSITE OF

57
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,417
TERMS APPROACH.

58
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:28,986
IT'S NOT BEEN GOING BACK TO

59
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:30,154
MAXIMUM PRESSURE.

60
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:31,656
IT'S BEEN CONCILIATION, SOMETIME

61
00:01:31,656 --> 00:01:32,723
POLICY AND NEGOTIATIONS

62
00:01:32,723 --> 00:01:33,291
ET CETERA.

63
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,425
HE HAS ORCHESTRATED MOST OF THE

64
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:36,460
SORT OF DIPLOMATIC OVERTURE.

65
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,962
A LOT OF CREDIT IS OWED TO HIM.

66
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:39,363
A LINE OF CREDIT IS OWED TO THE

67
00:01:39,363 --> 00:01:42,066
FACT THEY NOW HAVE LEVERAGE WITH

68
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:42,867
THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

69
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,802
THEY FEEL MORE ON AN EQUAL

70
00:01:44,802 --> 00:01:45,102
BASIS.

71
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:46,671
THEY CAN SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING

72
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:47,371
TABLE WITH THE UNITED STATES.

73
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:48,139
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THESE THINGS

74
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:48,406
IN.

75
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:50,841
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS.

76
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:51,676
>> Laura: LITERALLY, THIS IS

77
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,477
WHAT I THINK TRUMP IS IF HE DOES

78
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:54,045
AND IF HE DOESN'T.

79
00:01:54,045 --> 00:01:57,882
IF NORTH KOREA WAS MOVING APACE

80
00:01:57,882 --> 00:02:01,052
WITH MORE TESTS, MORE BALLISTIC

81
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:03,387
MISSILE TESTING, THEY ALSO HAD A

82
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:04,288
FACILITY COLLAPSE ON ITSELF.

83
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:06,290
BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS BUILT,

84
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,358
WHAT IT WAS TUNNELING

85
00:02:07,358 --> 00:02:07,758
UNDERNEATH.

86
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:08,893
COLLAPSE ON ITSELF.

87
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:09,759
THE WHOLE NARRATIVE IN

88
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,262
NORTH KOREA IS COLLAPSING BUT

89
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:14,098
THE PRESSURE THAT WAS BROUGHT TO

90
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:15,466
BEAR ON HIM WITH THIS

91
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:16,200
UNCONVENTIONAL AMERICAN LEADER

92
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,968
WHO DIDN'T FEEL LIKE HE HAD TO

93
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:20,471
PLAY BY THE OLD RULEBOOK, I

94
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:22,273
THINK MOVES IT TO THE PLACE THAT

95
00:02:22,273 --> 00:02:24,342
IT IS NOW THAT NOBODY PREDICTED.

96
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:25,243
NO ONE IS PREDICTING THAT

97
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:28,279
DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE THE ONE TO

98
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:29,280
OVERSEE THIS SUMMIT AND TO CARRY

99
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,880
OUT THE SUMMIT.

100
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,082
AGAIN, SEEING WHERE IT GOES.

101
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:31,782
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WE

102
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:34,685
HAVE TO BE CAUTIOUS BUT COME ON.

103
00:02:34,685 --> 00:02:35,886
THE FACT THAT HE'S NOT GETTING

104
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:37,288
ANY CREDIT FROM THESE PEOPLE, I

105
00:02:37,288 --> 00:02:38,589
THINK IT'S DISHONEST AT THIS

106
00:02:38,589 --> 00:00:00,000
POINT.
