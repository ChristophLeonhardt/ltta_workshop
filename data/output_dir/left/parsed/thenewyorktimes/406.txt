It is inspired by the ancient quipu
idea of talking knots,
which was how the Incans
recorded history.
The visitor would come into the
room at first unsure of how to
interact with these ropes.
But as soon as they knew that
they could touch these ropes,
that they could feel them, that
they could throw them around,
everything changed. It was like their
bodies became part of the work.
There was a kind of childish delight
in moving through the space.
The first thing you encounter is the
smell. It was this earthy, loamy smell.
Lewis had filled the entire
foyer with couches and this
explosion of house plants that
were almost aggressive in nature.
At times it was unclear who was
part of the work and who was a visitor,
who was a dancer and who was just
there to see what was going on.
I'm not sure the distinction mattered.
"Anywhen" resisted description.
Hashtag, you had to be there.
An amalgamation of video
footage, of ventriloquism,
cuttlefish and cityscapes,
a manic marquee sign,
a graceful beacon lamp that slid
the length of the space,
a motley assortment of inflatable
fish and a plethora of tiny speakers.
No two moments were the same,
and here was the kicker,
this whole universe was
controlled by a jar of yeast,
the sounds of the museum
and an algorithm.
Sounds complicated?
Good. It was.
"London Fog" felt at once
minimal and complex.
There was a sort of profound
dialogue between the elements
and the artists, between museum
and the city around it.
Around me, the fog was
changing with the breeze.
It rose up and twisted,
obscuring the world beyond.
For a moment, I was trapped in a cocoon,
completely transported.
And then the mist broke,
and I was standing next to a
museum inside a great
and beautiful city.
There's so many different ways
to move through the museum.
You can use it as a thoroughfare,
as a picnic spot
as a place to declare your love,
as a place to fall asleep.
A museum needs to contain
all of these spaces.
In a way a city should be
designed like a museum.
Places for collision,
places for thinking,
places for commerce,
places for art-making.
A city and a museum should
not be all that different.
