show this is a jam-packed show for you today we are going to give you very latest on Roy Moore that is heating up because it now appears that a lot of his media supporters are moving away from but when war isn't going anywhere and he is not sinking in the polls the latest poll has Roy Moore up 49 43 there's the real possibility the guy about whom credible allegations of sexual molestation have been made will end up being elected to the United States Senate which of course puts the Republican Party in a very interesting position we'll discuss all of that plus again see Jeff Sessions on the hill should there be a special counsel for Hillary Shep Smith he did when went after some folks on the right for talking about uranium one so I want to let you know what's true and what's false about uranium one we'll get to all of those things but first we say thank you to our sponsors over at helix so I'm on the road I'm actually broadcasting today from Fox News I was on outnumbered earlier

apparently everywhere this is sort of a shocking story that went completely under the under the radar yesterday but there is a democratic woman named Jackie Speier she's a congresswoman on the hill and she in an interview yesterday MSNBC she said there are two members of the House who have been hit with serious sexual harassment shows the house over the past several years has paid out 15 million dollars in sexual harassment claims that's your taxpayer dollars in mind paying off women for guys who can't keep their their grubby hands off so here's what jackie speier had to say now we we do know that there's a about 15 million dollars that has been paid out by the house on behalf of harasser x' in the last ten to fifteen years fifteen million dollars has been paid out over sexual harassment claims so obviously more than one member of Congress you know how many over time that is I know that some of them are former members now I don't really know okay that's a lot of money it's a serious amount of money and if we're all gonna go nuts over Bill O'Reilly's alleged 32 million dollar settlement on sexual harassment 15 million bucks is a lot of money this is why Paul Ryan the Speaker of the House has now come out and said that we need to have mandatory harassment training in Congress first of all I'm shocked that they didn't have mandatory harassment training before like pretty much every major company that I've worked yet has had to have some sort of form of HR training including me of watch a sexual harassment tape one of these dumb tapes from the 80s where they show you that you're not allowed to grab a woman's butt which you should have known since you're not a jerk but in any case Paul Ryan comes out he says we need mandatory harassment training it is today's hearing was another important step in our efforts to combat sexual harassment and ensure a safe workplace I want to especially thank my colleagues who shared their stories going forward the house will adopt a policy of mandatory anti harassment and anti discrimination training for all members and staff our goal is not only to raise awareness but also make abundantly clear that harassment in any form has no place in this institution so I'm not a general fan of anti harassment training I don't think that her Astor's stopped harassing because because of this harasser stopped harassing when they feel there are consequences Mark Levin has suggested that speaker Ryan and the Senate and senator Mitch McConnell should step down from their positions if they've been covering up sexual harassment I think that's a little bit much I but what I do think that they should be coming forward with names and naming and shaming sexual harassers if the allegations are credible seems to me the best way of going about alleviating this particular problem rather than paying out my money and yours from our wallets so that some sexually predatorial congressperson can get his rock it's not just in Congress this is one of the worst kept secrets in Congress by the way is is the the amount of drunken luxury that happens in Congress is really quite astonishing it's been true for pretty much centuries at this point also the the fallout in Hollywood continues a more sexual harassment in Hollywood so John Stewart comes out he says I was just stunned stunned to learn about the revelations about louis c.k here's the estimable Jon Leibowitz stunned I think you know you give your friends a benefit of the doubt I tried to think of it in terms of you know I've had friends who have compulsions and who have done things gambling or drinking or drugs and we've lost some of them some of them have died and you always find yourself back to a moment of did I miss something could I have done more are the thing and in this situation I think we all could have we all could have is a way of saying I couldn't have you could have the answer is yes Jon Stewart you probably could have considered that you're asked the specific question in 2016 and tried away from answering it meanwhile there are certain harassers in Hollywood who are continuing to get away with it George Takei as you recall he made a statement on Howard Stern's show in which he openly admitted to grabbing men by their penises men who were skittish to encourage them in their in their proclivities and here was here was his original audio I want to play that then I want to show you what he said in his statement and people are letting him off the hook for this did you ever grab anyone by the against their will you never sexually harassed an a boner have you it's some people that are kind of skittish right or may be afraid and you're trying to persuade that but you know do we need to call the police the answer is yes you need to call the police here was George Takei's statement that came out on Monday quote many have raised concern over a back and forth between Howard Stern and myself where we joked about me touching men during my Star Trek days 50 years ago well first of all it didn't sound like that was your Star Trek it sounds like it's a pretty consistent question out of context I agree that the joke was distasteful I'm very sorry he and I made fun out of a serious matter for decades I have played the part of a nadie grandpa when I visit Howard's show a caricature I now regret but I want to be clear I've never forced myself upon someone during a date sometimes my dates were the initiators sometimes I was it was always by mutual consent I see now that it has come across poorly in the awkward sketch that is not a sketch okay you heard the audio yourself but George Takei will get away with it he he like he like Kevin Spacey is choosing to live as a gay man I guess and so will get away with it meanwhile there's a story from The Huffington Post that sexual harassment was tolerated on a routine basis over at Huffington Post this is from Gizmodo what they say is Arianna Huffington's history with a former managing editor who's transferred to launch HuffPost India was later revealed to be the result of an HR investigation into whether he had sexually harassed multiple young women in the New York office shows that Huffington wasn't overly concerned with sexual harassment in the office his moto recently revisited those allegations and not only independently confirmed that the investigation was indeed the reason for that Managing Editors transfer but that huffington knew about his actions before they were reported to HR according to a former employee Aaron Krantz the woman who wrote this piece called Melanie Aaron Krantz she says by turning a blind eye she bore ultimate responsibility for any issues that arose under her leadership according to the report Huffington sure the elevation of the guy named Jimmy Soni who was then managing editor of the website and it was common knowledge around the newsroom and and huffington knew about it that he was sexually harassing the help vice there's a there's a story about Vice today being hit with serious allegations of sexual harassment so this is to say sexual harassment apparently is out of control and the question is why are we just noticing this announced there are two theories as to why we are just noticing this now theory number one is the david frum theory this is the optimistic theory of human nature which is everyone has been sexually harassing for decades and only now do we care because we're better than they were a decade ago right we didn't care about Bill Clinton a decade ago we care about Bill Clinton at speak us we're better now and then there's Theory number two theory number two is that bad men have always sexually harassed women but the people only care about it now particularly on the left because they're trying to get Donald Trump and Roy Moore I think that this is the correct theory I don't think the left really cares very much about sexual harassment I think the left has been bring up their their lack of care about sexual harassment for years they use a changing sexual standard to basically allow them to let people off the hook they want to let off the hook and to put on the hook people they want to put on the hook so right now they want to put the Roy Moore and Donald Trump on the hook and therefore they're gonna pretend to take sexually harassed sexual harassment super seriously when it's Anthony Weiner or Bill Clinton then it's a completely different story the reason that I say this is because there's a piece in voxcom from an execrable columnist named Matt Iglesias he wrote about a two thousand word essay about why Bill Clinton should have resigned from office in 1998 now I checked my calendar this morning it turns out it's not 1998 it's 2017 so he's 19 years late to the party Glacia admits that at the time he wanted Clinton to stay he said he was glad to see Clinton prevail and regarded the whole sordid manner as primarily the fault of congressional Republicans excessive scandal mongering but he admits I think we got it wrong what we should have talked about was men abusing their social and economic power over younger and less powerful limits it doesn't talk about one Nina Broderick he hasn't talked about Kathleen Willey he talks specifically about Monica Lewinsky and here's what he says quote excuse me it was far from the most egregious case of workplace sexual misconduct in American history but it was unusually high-profile the facts were not in dispute the perpetrator had a lot of nominal feminist ideological commitments and political leaders who shared those commitments had the power to force him from office had he resigned in shame we all might have made a collective cultural and political decision that a person called leveraging power over women in inappropriate ways ought to be fired instead we lost nearly two decades yes yes we did so where are you on Bob Menendez Matt well it turns out that he doesn't want bob menendez to step down and if you had this choice now he really wouldn't want Clinton to step down anyway he says the reason that Clinton should have stepped down is because he abused power relationships this is my favorite part of his little article he says Republicans shouldn't have bothered going after Bill Clinton for perjury instead they should have used the feminist line the Monica Lewinsky was cudgelled into her affair they should have said that Clinton seduction of Lewinsky was quote morally bankrupt in contributing in a meaningful way to serious social problem that disadvantages millions of women throughout their lives that wouldn't have worked of course I was there in 1998 I recall that at the time the left was suggesting the Monica Lewinsky was a slut who was positioning bill not a victimize innocent pressured by the most powerful man on earth if the right had suggested that she was an innocent proposition by the most powerful man on earth and this was sexual harassment the left would then accuse the right of depriving Monica Lewinsky of her agency and being sexist there's a beautiful thing about being part of the left you can always find an excuse to attack the people you want to attack and the proof is in the pudding because Iglesias says the real reason that Clinton should have been dumped in 1998 is cuz the Al Gore was vice president and nothing would have changed he says and he says now it's worthwhile dumping bill over but it wouldn't been worthwhile last year he says now that Hillary is out of electoral politics and has emerged as a bigger draw and more important political force than her husband there's no excuse for Democrats not to look back on these events with more objectivity you wonder what you wonder why so many Republicans are backing Roy Moore it's because they're using precisely the the mirror negative of this the the Polaroid negative of this particular argument right Matt Iglesias is basically saying the Bob Menendez shouldn't step down because the current governor is Chris Christie if he waits a few months and he steps down then the governor will be will be a Democrat and then everything will be great he says that Bill Clinton should have stepped down because Al Gore was the vice president so in other words he doesn't really care about sexual harassment or at least he cares about sexual harassment up to the point it means political sacrifice then he shied away and then he wonders why people in Alabama are backing Roy Moore why there are so many Republicans who are willing to back Roy Moore even thinking that these allegations are correct or at least or at least credible so I want to talk a little bit more about this but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriots apply so if you're trying to get prepared for an emergency and you're looking around your house and figuring okay there could be a natural disaster or god forbid a terrorist attack you know a crime wave whatever it is that requires you to stay inside for a period of a couple of days without going to the grocery store well that's what my Patriot supply is for okay there's a reason that FEMA recommends three days of emergency supplies and you may need more than that and that's why you should get your 102 servings survival food kit for only $99 it includes breakfast lunches and dinners it is shipped to your home for free again it's 102 servings that means that if you have a four members of your family then you're going to be getting you know twenty five meals per person basically it's one hundred and two servings order a kit for yourself right now call eight eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen go online to prepare with Ben the emergency flute lasts up to 25 years in storage my Patriot supply the people that you can trust folks around the office who have tasted their food they say it tastes like home cooking and again you buy it once stick it in the closet forget about it and then one day you need it you were prepared the guy next door wasn't that's why you need to go to 888 803 1413 give them a call or prepare with been calm again eight eight eight oh three fourteen thirteen or prepare with been calm okay so with this as background the fact that sexual harassment is is now obviously commonplace all over the place and the fact that media are paying attention for political motivations we have to ask ourself a question okay we as conservatives have to ask ourself a question should it matter should it matter now we've been asking this question for last several days I've suggested that it absolutely should matter whether Roy Moore was molesting fourteen or sixteen year olds or whether that are crowded credible allegations that he is doing so but there are a lot of people who are saying listen the left is politically motivated if this were leftist they wouldn't be doing the same thing The Washington Post might not have even reported this story if it were about doug jones as opposed to Roy Moore so why should we deprive ourselves of a Senate seat in order to show the world what gentlemen we are which is a fine and solid question there they're basically three ways that this can go from here okay and two of those ways don't involve depriving yourself of the Senate seat way number one is is the worst that is more stays on the ballot and splits votes and doug jones ends up in the senate that is that is politically speaking for the republicans the worst because then they have 51 votes in the senate it's very difficult for them to pass legislation with 52 let alone 51 it means that Lisa Murkowski and John McCain or Susan Collins and John McCain two senators can basically stymie the rest of the Republican agenda for the next couple of years at the very least that's a possibility and so people are shying away from that possibility so that leaves two other possibilities one is a write-in campaign the problem with the write-in campaign is that Moore says he's not going he's now Jennifer Holliday in in in Dreamgirls right he's telling you he's not going he's just not going to he's gonna cling on there with his fingernails he will not leave he's repeating this and he's looking at the polls and saying why should I leave I'm raising more money than I ever had he brings like 250,000 dollars yesterday which is sort of a sad commentary on the nature of our reactionary politics the Roy Moore is Ray way more money in the aftermath of child sex allegations than he was before that but people hate the media just that much and they think it's a political hit just that much so he stays in they split the vote Doug Jones wins possibility number two is that there is a right in Canada to see for Jeff Sessions Jeff Sessions would be the best pick you won 96 percent of the vote in the last Alabama Senate race you put Luther strange in the right in it's not gonna help both there's strange in the right in and that's going to be that's gonna be a serious problem because Luther strange couldn't even win a primary against Roy Moore there been people suggesting that Richard burr who's the current senator of Alabama should step down and then run for the open seat as a write-in candidate and then his seat will come up with for a special election that's a possibility too in other words using some sort of nationai ssin to prevent more from being elected that would be the best but the most plausible solution and then the most plausible outcome here is that more actually gets elected the more stays in more wins the election and then Republicans in Congress have a have to decide they have to make a decision are they gonna see him or are they not the case for seating him is the people of Alabama have spoken they heard the allegations they didn't trust them not our problem the case for not seating him is credible allegations of child molestation I am in the camp that says that if he's elected you should not seat him the reason I say this is because like the founders I am NOT a Democrat I am a Republican that means with small D and small R I'm not somebody who believes that the will of the people in its purest form must always be done I think that the exercise of independent judgement by legislators is important which is why I think character is important in legislators I'm a believer that the electoral college was created specifically to prevent dictatorship right I'm a believer that that the institutions of our government were created with the knowledge that there should be people who every once in a while have to do the right thing even in spite of their constituents this to me seems like pretty clear-cut case of that especially because in the amount of Glacia smash the governor of Alabama is a Republican who will then appoint a Republican to fill the seats at least until the next a special election so it's interesting to see where everybody is coming down on all of this and it's also interesting to see just how how much dirty tricks are being used in Alabama I'm not just talking about you know quote-unquote dirty tricks against Roy Moore you know a credible allegation is a credible but by people who are associated presumably with more so we don't know who sent this fake robo call but there was a fake robo call that was going around Alabama and this fake robo call was from a guy who characterizes himself as Lenny Lenny Bernstein from the Washington Post offering money to people to make false allegations against Roy Moore the suspicion is of course that this is someone who's associated with the Roy Moore campaign and that this is somebody who's attempting to convince people that all of the allegations are false oh that the Washington Post pay people off here's what it sounded like I love they use a Jewish name for it really a nice dog whistle they're here here's the the audio for the Washington Post anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old we're gonna make damage using remarks about Canada anymore for a world of between 5,000 or 7,000 dollars there will not be fully investigating these claims however will an ingress report I can be reached by email Albert's Elberton seen in Washington Post car the purpose of this of course is not to actually gather information Elle Bernstein a Washington Post com apparently doesn't exist the purpose is to issue robot calls to make people think that this was what the Washington Post was doing really really gross stuff very very unpleasant stuff so that's happening so as all of this happens even the conservatives in media have broken down into two groups sean hannity who's obviously signaling from the White House last night on his program you know Sean talks regularly with President Trump they're very close apparently they speak nearly every night and and Sean basically laid the wood to more he said listen you have 24 hours to figure out a good way to rebut these allegations or you should get out of the race between this interview that I did and the inconsistent answers between him saying I never knew this girl and then that yearbook comes out for me the judge has 24 hours you must immediately and fully come up with the satisfactory explanations for your inconsistencies that I just showed you must remove any doubt if you can't do this then judge Moore needs to get out of this race okay so that was seen as an ultimatum from the White House Trump of course has remained utterly immovable and in silence on this issue which is amazing it's amazing because Trump is the person who could help solve all of this if Trump jumped in with both feet ins and more needs to get out and then all of a sudden the polls show that Moore's base was completely eroding then you might actually get a write-in candidate see that would be worthwhile because writing can diseases are tough but Trump staying out of this race is a real problem Trump has continued to maintain silence I hope he doesn't say I think from you know should know better than that it's not just hannity tucker carlson who i didn't watch a show earlier this week so i don't know if he was inclined to to doubt the allegations but whatever he was doing earlier this week now Tucker says that Moore who's been hiding behind Christianity has been hiding behind his faith saying I'm out you know they're out to get me just like Jesus kind of thing Carlson says that's nonsense Roy Moore has every right to protest his innocence and maybe he is innocent what he's not allowed to do is drag God into all of this God is not accused of trolling for teenagers in shopping malls this is not about Christianity it's about Roy Moore and it just credits Christianity when Christians allow more to use his faith as a shield it's offensive to real believers and this of course is exactly correct good for Tucker Carlson so it looks like the bottom is falling out a little bit for for Roy Moore except in his home state so he does have some media defenders Rush Limbaugh was suggesting on his show that a search-and-destroy more a Search and Destroy mission against Roy Moore is really Mitch McConnell's doing it's really about Mitch McConnell that all these people are jumping on board because they hate Roy Moore listen I had not said that you should not vote for Roy Moore I was very uncomfortable with Roy Moore I criticized way more but I had not openly stated I think I said that if I were in Alabama I wouldn't vote for him but I also said very similar to what before any of these allegations came out very similar to what I said about Donald Trump which is you know I saw I certainly understand voting for Roy Moore to prevent a Democrat from taking the seat but after these allegations the idea that this is really about McConnell anymore that's all people have bad faith who are seeking to take down Roy Moore it doesn't really hold but Russia's trying to rush was trying to push that yesterday Annan has been very upfront about the objective he has and that's to get Mitch McConnell out of the Senate and so I don't think I even even if all we had was one allegation against judge Moore this was gonna be it for judge Moore didn't matter because this is this is now being used to send a message to what to Bannon and his group that you just you you think you're gonna get rid of me well take a look at what's gonna happen every time you try okay that's that's not really true so been and wants to make it about that Bannon wants to make it about it's me versus McConnell but it really is not about him versus McConnell at all at this point it's just about the truth or falsity of the allegations Bandon by the way continues to stick by more the reason he continues to stick by more is because he stapled himself to Moore's leg is more one the primaries and then trying to claim credit he was he was the chicken in staple day he was the the the dog that is stapled himself to the chickens leg to cross the road and then claim credit for giving the chicken a ride that's not actually what happened in this particular case but it's a seductive way of moving attention off of the actual allegations and toward the politics of the situation okay so before I go any further and talk about people in Alabama who are continuing to support Roy Moore including mo Brooks oh there was a representative from Alabama first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over the u.s. CCA so if you're a gun owner can you say with 100% confidence that your family and your home are safe what if you're forced to pull the trigger do you know what's gonna happen when the police arrive well if you need to know these answers and you probably do then you need the answers from the US CCA's complete concealed carry and family defense guide you're about to miss your chance to get yours

it's a free audiobook as well so you finish the show you still have a ride home and now you need to know you you have something to listen to so again it's defend my family now com from our good friends over at the u.s. concealed-carry Association okay so it's not just rush who is who's basically trying to cast this in political terms mo Brooks thought made what I thought was maybe most intellectually honest argument here he basically said listen it doesn't really matter what Roy Moore has done or not done at least he's not Doug Jones and he's not gonna vote for abortion said I believe the Democrats will do great damage to our country is it I believe the Democrats will do damage for a country a myriad of issues then he's a sprinting away from the reporter so obviously not questions that Mel Brooks would like to would like to answer you know bad candidates who refuse to get out that the Roy Moore is refusing to get out because he believes he can win and the polls show that he can win and this demonstrates why the voters need to stop thinking in binary terms in terms of personalities binary terms and in moral terms are good binary terms in terms of personality are not good so it's not a binary choice between Steve ban and and Mitch McConnell it's not a binary choice between Roy Moore and and Doug Jones especially not now if you went through support from Roy Moore you could easily get a write-in candidate and you could fix this problem in a much more in a much more smooth way but people don't want to make the binary moral choice so instead they've swivel to binary personality choices you know do I do I like Doug Jones or do I like where I'm or do I like Steve Allen's or like Mitch McConnell there's only one binary choice here do you think it is important enough not to have an alleged child molester sitting in the Senate to not vote for him and vote for someone else and I'm not talking about voting for Doug Jones I'm talking about voting for a write-in candidate or do you hate the media so much and you suspect the media so much and you think the whole thing's rigged that you're willing to take the risk that you're putting somebody in the Senate who is an utter piece of human debris so these are questions that I think we all ought to ask ourselves in all honesty well that's not even close to the all the news that we have to get to

conservative podcast in the nation so meanwhile Jeff sessions was on the hill the Attorney General was on the hill yesterday to answer questions about a variety of issues ranging from leaks inside the Trump administration its impossibility of setting up a special counsel for Hillary Clinton now I want to start this discussion about the special counsel for Hillary Clinton by discussing what exactly the special counsel before so there are two separate questions that have really come out in the context of why we might need a special counsel and it really is more why we need an investigation not necessarily a special counsel so those are two separate questions too so number one question do we need a special counsel number two question for what so well that's for the second question first what is the for what why wouldn't you need a special counsel so why would you need an investigation so the reason that you need investigation into Hillary Clinton is because Hillary Clinton hired fusion GPS a Russian connected firm in order to dig up dirt on Donald Trump and then it appears that that that material was used as the basis for a FISA requests from the FBI there are questions is whether the FBI actually continued to pay for this dossier some of which has been discredited and so the question is really whether Hillary Clinton's did anything illegal been using a Russian connected source in order to promote in order to promote a hit on Donald Trump we don't know the answers to that I think there's some unfilled gaps in that suspicion I think that we'd have to figure out that Hillary number one knew that she was getting information directly from the Russian government or that you paid to the Russian government for that information there was some exchange that actually took place or didn't take place some sort of favor that was being done we'd have to find out what the story is there that is Story number one story number two is the Iranian one scandal so the left has been going crazy why are we even talking about uranium one so one of the people who spent some time quote-unquote debunking the uranium one scandal yesterday was Shep Smith Shep Smith of course is a left-leaning host on Fox News and he spent a significant amount of time on his show yesterday debunking what he thought was the foolishness of looking at the uranium one scandal to begin with here was his description uranium one is the name of a South Africa based mining company back in 2007 it merged with Eurasia energy based in Canada and in 2010 the mining arm of the Russian nuclear agency Raza Tom bought controlling interest in the company among other places that mining company had operations in Wyoming that amounted to what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's or the NRC said was at the time about 20% of uranium production capacity in the u.s. today the NRC says it's about 10% now here's the accusation nine people involved in the deal made donations to the Clinton Foundation totaling more than 140 million dollars in exchange Secretary of State Clinton approved the sale to the Russians a quid pro quo okay and then Shepard Smith would go on to debunk this right Shepard Smith would say well she didn't approve the sale to the Russians it was approved by a bunch of agencies and it wasn't 140 million dollars and one of the people who was accused of giving all this money to Hillary Clinton had left rasa tahn by the time this happened all of this is true but it's not the whole story so I'm gonna tell you the whole story of what exactly happened with uranium 1 this is not according to me this is according to leftist sources like politifact and the New York Times so here is what we know there's an item Frank Giustra okay Frank Jastrow was a close confidant of the Clintons he owned that company that he heard Shep Smith mentioned they're called Eurasia it was sold to uranium 1 in 2007 just recessed he divested his personal stake in the company at that time but his shareholders owned 60% of the company and there's no way to confirm the truth of his claim in 2010 rasa tahn tried to buy 51% of the company this rose to the level of the government because this looked like a security problem not because they were gonna ship all of the Iranian from the United States to Russia and make nukes but because it actually deprived the United States of a strategic nuclear asset that was required for our military because we had a uranium shortage in 2013 Russia bought the entirety of uranium 1 with the approval of the Committee on foreign investment in the United States CFIUS as well as the u.s. the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's and Utah agencies the State Department had to sign off because the State Department was part of the CFIUS Hillary claims she had nothing to do with green-lighting this she didn't stop it from going through so the again the acquisition that gesture I had divested himself at this point so all of his donations to the Clinton Foundation had nothing to do with uranium 1 and in reality it was just about four million dollars that was donated to the Clinton Foundation from people associated with uranium 1 this is a little simplistic so here's the full story this is courtesy of the New York Times in a 2015 piece they report the uranium won its acquisition actually sort of began in 2005 when just Russ still owned the company quote with mr. Clinton at his side according to The Times the two men had flown aboard mr. jester as private jet to Almaty Kazakhstan where they died with the authoritarian president nursultan nazarbayev mr. Clinton handed the kazakh president a propaganda coup when he expressed support from Nazarbayev's bid to head an international elections monitoring group undercutting American foreign policy and criticism of Kazakhstan's pork human rights record by among others his wife who was then a senator within days of the visit jester's fledgling company Eurasia Energy signed a preliminary deal giving its takes in three uranium mines controlled by the state-run uranium agency has that come from okay so now you're Eurasia which is just rows company owns a bunch of assets in Kazakhstan this by the way is one of the reasons the Russians wanted to buy the company this this us-based company they wanted to buy the company because they didn't just want the holdings in the United States they really want more one of the holdings in Kazakhstan Eurasia into this company in 2007 merged with uranium one at that point that was when just row says that he divested himself but the new company was controlled by Eurasia investors including the item Indians Helfer a Canadian who became chairman just for me about forty five million bucks off the deal and and he sold his stake but he had given a bunch of money to the Clinton so that in itself is is you know an element of corruption although Hillary is not yet Secretary of State uranium one is all according to the New York Times right not according to me uranium one began to snap up companies with the assets in the United States in April 2007 it bought uranium mills in Utah it bought in Wyoming it bought in Texas and then The Times published an article showing the two thousand five trips linked to the the Kazakhstan mining zeal between the Clintons and the and uranium one and just draw gesture I had donated thirty-one point three million dollars to Clinton's foundation okay and it's the Clintons were still involved after just truck dropped out so the idea here from Shep Smith and some people are left is once gesture was gone what are you whining about here is the answer mister Telfer right who's the new head of uranium one gave undisclosed donations of somewhere between 1.3 million and five point six million dollars in contributions they are reported from a constellation of people with ties to uranium one or Eurasia without those assets the Russians would have had no interest in the deal the Kazakh assets there had no interest in the deals it was just that it wasn't just that apparently early on in the Obama administration it looked like uranium one was not going to be able to get what they needed from Kazakhstan and so they went to the Clintons and said can you help and whether Hillary had anything to do with her or not the State Department intervened amid this influx of uranium one connected money Bill Clinton was invited to speak in Moscow in June 2010 the same month rasa tahn struck its steel from a majority stake in uranium one it was his single highest fee it was a half a million dollar fee for Bill Clinton paid by Renaissance Capital a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin okay so it is not at all clear that Hillary had nothing to do with this it is not at all clear that uranium 1 was completely clean you know I think that the most the most stretched allegation is the idea that uranium 1 was greenlit by Hillary Clinton personally but the idea that they intervened in 2009 2010 the State Department intervened a little bit to help lift Kazakh issues for uranium 1 that's not out of bounds it's weird that the entire Obama administration would sign off on all of this knowing that uranium 1 donations were going to the Clinton Foundation all of this is worthy of investigation so that's the answer number one yes this is worthy of investigation no it's not quite as clear cut as Shep Smith wanted to make it ok question number two does this deserve a special counsel so this is a different question special counsel suggests that the people who are in charge of investigating namely jeff Sessions he's not capable of doing a full investigation remember those are people that we hire right Jeff Sessions the guy we already paid to do these investigations the reason we have a special counsel now is because of Donald Trump ok Jeff Sessions originally recused himself because he testified wrongly that he had never met with anybody from Russia this of course was not true and so he recused himself in the Russia investigation but the next guy and the totem pole was not the Special Counsel it was rod Rosenstein the reason rod Rosenstein recused himself an appointed a special counsel is because Trump tried to use rod Rosenstein as a rationale for firing James Comey that forced Rosen scene to appoint a special counsel so now you're saying that on the hillary stuff sessions isn't capable of investigating I don't really see why now you sound the hillary stuff that Rosenstein is incapable of investigating i don't really see why so I'm not sure why special counsel is necessary as opposed to a normal DOJ investigation so sessions has just been batted about by both sides in Congress the Democrats are bashing sessions about by suggesting he's dishonest then he lied about his Russian ties I find that very hard to believe and then the people on the right are bashing him about for not appointing a special counsel as Donald Trump easily wants to quote-unquote lock her up my sympathies are largely with Jeff sessions here so we'll start with Jeff sessions talking to ted Lieu the the egregiously ban California Congress person he's he's currently running against a guy that I have endorsed in in his race and ted Lieu went after sessions and said that he was basically a liar about russia he recessions response yesterday on the hill i won't repeat it mr. chairman but I hope the congressman knows and I hope all of you know that my answer to that question I did not meet with the Russians was explicitly responding to the shocking suggestion that I as a surrogate was meeting on a continuing basis with Russian officials and the implication was to impact the campaign in some sort of nefarious way and all I did was meet in my office with the Ambassador which we didn't discuss anything like that so I just want to say I appreciate the congressman's right I guess he can sighs free speech he can't be sued here so it's just my response so basically their sessions saying you know if I could sue you I would but there is a the a parliamentary immunity so you can see what everyone on the floor of Congress sessions then was asked by trey Gowdy and Jim and Jim Jordan from Ohio why he was not setting up a Hillary special counsel again I don't think sessions is doing the wrong thing here I think that just because the Eric Holder politicized the Department of Justice and used it as a political weapon on behalf of Barack Obama just cuz he called himself Obama's wing man and then went out and acted like it doesn't mean that the goj can afford to have every Attorney General be used as a baton by the administration and I think sessions is saying something true here here he was asked why he's not setting up a special counsel for Hillary and here was his answer well mr. Comey is no longer the director the FBI thank goodness we have an excellent man of integrity and ability and Chris Ray and I think he's going to do an outstanding job and I'm very happy I would say tomorrow night asking for us a time the gentleman I would say looks like is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel okay and that is the proper legal standard Jeff Sessions is just his job he takes an enormous amount of crap for it but sessions on this particular issue while the Democrats are ripping him for being unfair sessions is the one who basically appointed the special counsel you know to investigate the 2016 election and it was sessions who right now is saying listen I need a legal standard in order for me to meet that legal standard by the way it's not like sessions isn't doing his job I mean sessions said yesterday that they are in full investigation mode against 27 separate leaks outside of the Trump administration here's what he had to say on that we had about none open investigations of classified leaks in the last three years we have twenty seven investigations open today we intend to get to the bottom of these leaks I think it reached has reached epidemic proportions it cannot be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to ensure that it does not continue you know this is one of the things that people don't get about the Trump administration you saw a bunch of Democrats were going around saying Trump should be impeached bob corker today we should remove the ability for Trump to launch a nuclear weapons outside of what Trump says and the fact that no major legislation has been passed when Trump leaves his department heads alone what they do is within not only within the normal bounds of political conduct it is typically quite good Jeff Sessions has been fine as the Attorney General and all the crap he's had to take in order to do that is I think a foolish mistake on the part of people on the right and the left okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things that I like this week I've been encouraged by by Andrew Klavan and by Michael Mills the execrable Michael Mills sorry as I say I experiment incredible to read this book poetic diction by Owen Barfield it is a supremely pretentious book but it does have a lot of interesting things to say about what it is that makes poetry reach us and how human language has changed over time and really how human understanding of the world has changed over time and has simultaneously enriched our the the variety of language while undercutting the innate richness of each word so the sort of idea the sort of thesis behind poetic diction is that a long time ago when you look at words like Ruach in the bible Ruach means it means both wind and and so we have two words for that right we have wind and spirit when you read old ancient books and you read the word rueake it has a different sense right a different a sense of richness to it then neither wit nor spirit really does justice to because it includes both the reason for that says Barfield is because people perceived more meaning to be associated with the physical world than they necessarily perceived to be associated with the physical world today and so we've been more specific with our language but that also that's specificity means that when we read the word winds now it doesn't have the same impact as when we read older poetry when you read a homer it feels replete with a certain meaning that modern poetry just can't match and that's because the language itself of the time was richer in content if not in variety so that's that sort of the basic ideas it's it's an interesting book I think that it has some really good insights about how language is used and how the use of the devolves over time okay time for some things that I hate all right so thing that I hate number one so Joe Biden obviously wants to run for president again I will be curious to see if there's any widespread media investigation of allegations that have been made by former Secret Service agents that he mistreated female Secret Service agents those have been this has been alleged in a couple of places that I've seen all of these allegations I believe should be should be hunted down and researched to the fullest extent by Biden obviously wants to run for president again he's making the rounds he think he would have one last time there's a poll out today that shows that Biden would beat Donald Trump if the election were held today 46 to 34 something along those lines in a in a sort of normal Democrat versus Trump election it would be something like 48 to 34 in any case Biden is making the rounds and he was asked specifically about the shooting in Texas that recent church shooting in Texas and he was asked why would you want to remove the gun from the hands of the guy who stopped the church shooter right that this the the Stephen Willeford the the NRA former a gun instructor hero who shot the bad guy and here was Biden's response which is truly insane well first of all the kind of gun being carried he shouldn't be carrying assault weapons are I I wrote the first the last serious gun control law that was written it was law for 10 years and long assault weapons and a lot long weapons with magazines that had a whole lot of bullets and so you can kill a whole lot of people a lot more quickly number one number two it's just rational to say certain people shouldn't have guns now the fact that some people with guns are legally able to acquire a gun and they turn out to be crazy after the fact that's that's life there's nothing you can do about that but we can save a lot of lives and we've stopped tens of thousands of people from getting guns who shouldn't have guns well including presumably the guy who shot the bad guy so the Joe Biden knows less about guns than virtually anyone else I mean there's a guy who said that you should shoot through the front door of your house if so with the shotgun or I should go out on your balcony and you should you should blow a couple rounds and it's just he's ridiculous but you wonder why people think that the Democrats are gun grabbers it's because of this here's the question that probably though that preceded this answer was specifically about whether the shooter of the bad guy should have had a gun and that was Biden specific answer pretty amazing okay other things that I hate so Shannon Sharpe who has become a frequent contributor to things I hate so I appreciate his presence on Fox Sports 1 he says he's praising Colin Kaepernick so Colin Kaepernick was named the GQ Person of the Year citizen of the year which makes perfect sense since he didn't vote he doesn't speak publicly and he doesn't have much to say any more socks that had cops depicted his pigs obviously that is the Citizen of the year but Shannon Sharpe says the Kaepernick will go down in history as a mythical civil rights figure maybe Colin Kaepernick will never get the respect that he deserves for what he did but I believe when it's all said and done in history is written 30 40 years from now Colin Kaepernick will be looked upon as some of these mythical figures of the dr. King's the Muhammad Ali's and the Rose apart okay first of all to compare Colin Kaepernick to Martin Luther King is utterly objectin sane Martin Luther King not only provided a message that inspired millions of people it was a uniting message to compare him to Rosa Parks is also insane Rosa Parks helped organize with the n-double a-c-p the legal pretext for ending legalized segregation in the United States nothing like that is a current it's compared to Muhammad Ali however is a little bit different come him to Muhammad Ali actually is is not too far off because if you go back and look at what Muhammad Ali was saying during the 60s in the early 70s a lot of it was quite extreme a lot of those quite anti-american there's been a rewriting of Muhammad Ali's histories how's it possible that 30 years from now the left will have rewritten colin kaepernick into some sort of gentleman hero it's certainly a possibility but now just demonstrate that history can be rewritten in a myriad of false ways okay so I was gonna do some Bible talk this week but actually did some Bible talk last some extra Bible talk in in last week's mailbag so if you want Bible talk go back and listen to that but we have to break so that I can get on a plane and come back home and do my show from the studio tomorrow thanks again to the folks over at fox news for allowing me to use the studio I really appreciate it and we will see you tomorrow I'm entropy row this is the Ben Shapiro show
