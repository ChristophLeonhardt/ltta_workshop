the Diary of Anne Frank but with a new and nauseating twist more about that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel so today is what Wednesday five days ago Friday night I had one of the most horrifying dreams of my life I woke up Saturday in the worst mood and it pretty much soured my entire weekend this is no joke I am NOT just telling this story for effect unfortunately I had a dream that my parents and I were driving just south of the California border south of the US border in Mexico I don't know why God knows why the heck we would be going there anyway I told my dad who was driving in my dream not to go through a certain area my dad has a Tahoe SUV and in my dream I was concerned about the American flag decal that he had on the back of his car I didn't want him to drive through a certain area because I knew that it wasn't safe and that we would be targeted because of the American flag sticker the alternate route in my dream that I told my dad to take was blocked off so instead of turning back like I said we should he decided to proceed down the way that I knew was dangerous long story short a cartel guy came up to our window and shot my parents in front of me so naturally I woke up terrified and devastated you know that feeling when you can't even go on your normal day obviously it was just a dream but those types of Dreams affect you throughout the day and for me all weekend it didn't help that I was woken up at 5:00 a.m. by someone who was laying on their horn gotta love those considerate people here in LA anyway it's a sad commentary on our society that not only am i stressed about my safety during the cognitive waking hours of my day but now it is bleeding into my dreams conservatives are targeted every single day just look at the turning point folks in Philadelphia over the weekend getting thrown out of a diner Trump star in the boulevard Trump supporters out in public getting assaulted Sarah Sanders being forced out of a restaurant members of the administration's kids getting threatened it never ends and honestly some days it makes me want to quit my job because even though I feel like what I am doing is important and everyone here at the rebel I would never want to make anyone around me unsafe and that's something that I think about when you know think about possibly having kids one day am I going to have to quit my job for fear that my family too will be targeted anyway enough with my sob story moving on to my story of the day yes there is a point to this the lunacy of the left will be on stage for the entire world to see in an upcoming theatre production here in Los Angeles a new adaptation of the play The Diary of Anne Frank will be premiering here in LA but instead of families hiding Jews in their homes Jews who are facing extermination they are hiding illegals who are facing deportation the play centers around a Jewish woman who is hiding illegal aliens in her home protecting them from deportation so instead of the Gestapo it's ice officials so they are comparing the atrocities and genocide of Jews during the Holocaust to the justified and legal process of removing illegal aliens from our country CNN is the originator of the ice Nazi comparison and the network tweeted about the play saying this a Jewish woman heard an undocumented immigrant and her two daughters were on the run from ice driven by thoughts of the Holocaust she risked her own risked her own comfort to offer them shelter exactly this Jewish woman is risking her comfort not her life like those who hid Jews in their homes no one here is losing or risking their life not even the people being hidden and protected they are just going to be sent back to the country that they came from B Court before they came into this country illegally breaking the law in the process these comparisons are becoming nauseating these people I think really need to visit a Holocaust Museum to realize how offensive their comparisons are because it's only getting more and more ridiculous and we hear about it every day hope you all are having a fantastic week thanks for watching I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at www.affordablecomm.com thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel
