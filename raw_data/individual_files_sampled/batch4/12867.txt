you know Shania Twain the Canadian singer said last week that she would she couldn't vote obviously in the election but she would have voted for Trump the apparatus of the mainstream media in the entertainment industry descended upon her like vultures like monsters picking apart her flesh and she had to apologize and it was a little bizarre because she clearly stated her opinion then she said basically I'm sorry for stating my opinion next time I'll keep my opinion to myself but they descend on you say you can't say that shut your mouth you can't say that you can't say that and that this is a wonderful sign for Republicans and for the Trump people because as long as they are pressuring you and saying if you believe a certain thing you're gonna lose your job if you state common sense you're gonna lose your job at Google like James d'amour or if you hold a political view that was the main consensus political view until five minutes ago and like Brandon icon the issue of gay marriage you're gonna lose your company you're gonna lose Mozilla we're gonna take everything from you they incentivize people shutting up and what that means is they're gonna be less honest with pollsters they're gonna be the let they're not gonna be willing to say I'd vote for Trump because you could lose your job you could lose your reputation but they're still gonna go vote for Donald Trump there's two because they want to crack that culture that's a wonderful thing this is a groundhog yay is really what I think about it I think this is a wonderful sign for 2018 and 2020 by all rights there should be a blue wave by all rights the Democrats should retake the house and yet this culture is so poisonous people are being so censored and silenced to say why I actually kind of like the president he's doing a good job I don't know if you noticed it appears he's bringing peace to Korea after 70 years and is denuclearizing the craziest state on planet Earth
