You walk around this community and you notice
these weird looking satellite dish things.

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,020
This thing that looks like a satellite is
actually an ingenious method to cook food

3
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
using the sun.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,320
I'm not talking about solar energy, which
converts the sun into electricity and stores

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,560
it in a battery.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,440
This is much more direct, much more ingenious.

00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,400
She was making food, and then the rain started
coming, and she couldn't make food anymore.

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,080
She was going to boil some banana.

00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,670
One of the big problems facing Haiti is deforestation,
basically people use charcoal.

10
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,350
They burn it in order to make their food.

11
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,659
98% of the forests in Haiti have been cut
down.

12
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:36,049
There's no forests left, and you can see it
when you're going around.

13
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:40,579
On our way up here, we drove through some
of the most beautiful hills I've ever seen

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:00:00,000
in my life, and a lot of them were just totally
bald because they'd been deforested.
