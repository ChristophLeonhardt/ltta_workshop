researched it the more I could see that

22
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,129
it was a huge problem these families had

23
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,680
nowhere ago it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't clear which</font>

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,449
organization they were supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

25
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:53,789
for help they were getting bounced from

26

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,460
treated as if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't matter why</font>

28
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,989
were these organizations these different

government departments so difficult with

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,400
these people I think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was no system</font>

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,920
because nobody expected a war but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,299
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a legacy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Soviet Union</font>

that's never respective individuals and

34
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,210
there's never been a culture of openness

35
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:19,500
it's the opposite has always been a

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,060
culture of secrecy you never let people
