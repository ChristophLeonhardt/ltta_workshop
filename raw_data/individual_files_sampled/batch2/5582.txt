they're drilling down out on how Justice Anthony Kennedy retirement will have an impact on the Supreme Court for generations to come president Trump last night said 40 years or more with the president who is not likely to pick another swing voter there's concern about several controversial issues that are already settled by the court for now here's where Trump and Vice President pence stand on some of those issues we should the law be on abortion well I I have been pro-life I know what should the line of your principle that's a good value but what should be the law it has to be some form of punishment for the woman yeah I truly do believe if all of us do all that we can that we were once again in our time restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law should some form of abortion always be legal well to me I have exceptions rape incest if the mother is going to die Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States when Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides you said a few years ago that you were evolving on that issue where I'm traditional marriage it is changing rapidly do you support marriage equality it's irrelevant because it was already settled it's law it was settled in the Supreme Court I mean it's done so even if you appoint a judge that it's done it you have these cases have gone to the Supreme Court they've been settled and I think I'm I'm fine with it well that was clear as mud joining us now is Democratic congressman Sean Maloney of New York who's running for State Attorney General Derek Johnson is the president of the n-double a-c-p and Raul Reyes is an attorney and columnist all right congressman president Trump may have been fine with same-sex marriage being decided by the court but we know Mike Pence and evangelicals or not and that evangelical community is Trump's base they have stuck with him through thick and thin held their nose why because of all of those federal judges appointed because of now not one but two Supreme Court judges that the president steamrolled into happening are you worried about the future of marriage equality yes and everybody should be worried look three years ago I stood just a short distance from here and celebrated with thousands of pro marriage equality supporters and mine marriage for the first time was recognized under federal law so this is a personal issue you're talking about you're talking about the most important issue in my life I've been with my husband for 26 years but we've only been married for four and I tell you what that is on the line so so I think we all ought to get off the couch on this one and it doesn't matter what Donald Trump says we ought to know that by now it matters a lot who he picks and that person is going to come after the four key gay civil rights decisions that were authored by Anthony Kennedy and roe v wade and a bunch of other stuff and it is go time for progressives who care about the future of our country but congressmen are Democrats playing this the wrong way President Obama could have appointed someone to round out the year and while people could say they don't like Mitch McConnell he's not a good guy he's a hypocrite he is a tactical beast and he's gotten one now two Supreme Court justices in that seat so taking the high road and being the nice guy appears to have a lot of people finishing last Stephanie you got that exactly right I think Democrats screwed the pooch on the mayor Garlan thing and this thing was always going to come when we got rolled on that and we let him get away with it and then we lost an election and we got rolled on on on the 60-vote threshold on the Gorsuch thing so as as clear as day we should have seen this coming and now there is very little we can do about it except scream at the top of our lungs and organize and fight back like in the attorney general's office in New York and every other way we can but you're right these guys have been playing for keeps and we have been getting screwed and it is and it is a clear result of having sat around and let them get away with America Arlen thing and that is on Barack Obama's head and it is on the senators who let it happen a couple years back and now we are limited in our options and some of us who are in the crosshairs of this thing aren't going to forget that all right I'm interested in pursuing in a minute what what you mean when you say it's go time because I think that's the question but Derrick let's just bring in the conversation about affirmative action kennedy wrote the 4-3 majority opinion upholding the University of Texas's program but he didn't seem all that enthusiastic about it one of the things to know about Anthony Kennedy is as much as people describe him as originally a conservative he was almost more of a libertarian so affirmative action sometimes scratches him the wrong way but what do you see happening with a more traditionally conservative justice if cases like this come up again and they are likely to well I'm concerned about voting rights as a plethora of decisions that this Supreme Court could decide for the n-double a-c-p we see this as a state of emergency if the court is stacked would mean the rollback of civil rights advances that we've celebrated over the last 50 years you know many individuals would like to quote dr. King but they don't want to live the reality of which he spoke and this president this city is creating a real problem for the advancement of this country and unfortunately this Supreme Court may end up hearing whether or not this president can be committed a love or treason don't forget we're still under an investigation the mother investigation is not concluded and I hope they don't end up in the Supreme Court that's stacked by his appointments okay Raul when it comes to voting rights the Atlantic says this could be one of the changes we see the soonest we have already seen conservatives give a victory to Republican gerrymandering in Texas voter purging in Ohio with another trump appointee well the era of pork protecting civil rights be over that that could very well be the case and as we're seeing recently the court has chipped away incrementally of things that we have that we have taken for granted for decades in terms of the gerrymandering the right to purge just direct voters from the rolls so there will likely very likely be more cases in this vein to again and again erode these protections and aside from the politics that that is involved I see what another danger in this is that we will have segments of our of the electorate port for example African American voters Latino voters minority groups who come to view the court as not looking out for our interests and that is just whatever your views on the on these issues it's not healthy for our democracy yeah when you have a significant portion of the electorate the electorate that has lost faith in our institutions and couple that with the president with we know he has authoritarian tendencies so if he nominates someone with a very like-minded way of thinking things that we've taken for granted very well well this is so so Derrick calls it a state of emergency congressman Maloney you say it's go-time but Stephanie and I are really struggling with what that means congressman what does go-time look like because there are marches and there are protests and that's all interesting but when you look in Congress and you look at the people making this decision they look a whole lot like they looked 10 years ago 20 years ago 30 years ago 40 years ago my people say we're gonna take to the streets that makes for a beautiful image but none of those people in the street are involved in confirming the next Supreme Court justice no fair point and we should have seen this coming when we got rolled out Merrick garland and we shouldn't have taken for granted that Hillary Clinton was gonna win and it was a short-sighted a mistake to end the 60 vote filibuster both for the circuit courts and now for the Supreme Court and we are going to reap the the consequences of that but there is an election coming up including for the United States Senate and the most important thing the American public can do is to get involved in these elections and to send new people to Congress in both houses in this nonsense to that exact point the Democrats know what their party is and what their message is in just a few moments ally and I are going to sit down with the young woman who beat Joe Crowley in New York and she's a socialist it was just democratic so she's a democratic so well it was Stephanie if the question is is whether we need to get off our butts and start talking to people and find where the energy is in our own party sign me up and I don't care if you yeah I don't care if you knock out every incumbent in the Democratic Party as long as we start doing some things that matter in this country for families like mine they need it if you're talking about roe v wade now you're talking about you're talking about the Windsor decision you're talking about affirmative action you're talking about every critical thing we've put in place over the last 20-30 years is on the line I don't care who's in democratic leadership but I want all of us to do more and I think the only way we're gonna do that is to get our act together on this election and there's plenty of reasons to do it from guns to the Supreme Court to everything else we've seen this administration come after by the way with Justice Kennedy they they enshrine the Muslim ban and they screwed organized labor this week so we shouldn't need any other I think that's a very good game Derick you were making a point there for us go time for us state of emergency was any member of the US city seeking re-election who'd appeared or African American vote they better think twice if they cut a deal and not be instructions on this question this is a non-negotiable for the African American community so any member of the US Senate be them democrat or republican who rely on african-american votes this is not negotiable if you cut a deal you would not get our votes huh that's what we thought Dean of community because we're gonna be seeing potentially tests on daca tests on what if the president decided to ban immigrants from Central America right we could even see cases reaching the high court that deal with the family separations so these are all issues that again touch very much resonate with Latinos and Stephanie I know you're a little skeptical of values sounds like you're skeptical the value of marches and taking to the streets let me tell you as someone who has covered and participated in these when I was younger there is a value in this because number one is just participating in democracy but number two on a practical level like you know every one of these marches you go there there's always voter registration you always you meet other people who are like-minded you meet people maybe they're not with your your specific issue but they're part of the cause and then you realize we're not separate groups of LGBT and Latinos and African Americans and women's rights we are potentially a force to be reckoned with that value of cornucopia of ideas to me it look like it's lost in the last two years yes who rocks up with three words slogans but it's but I believe it's coming back we see incredible activism and motivation among Democrats and progressives on the ground so I feel that we will we will see that you know maybe some pushback to that hey MSNBC fans thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down there and click on any of the videos here to
