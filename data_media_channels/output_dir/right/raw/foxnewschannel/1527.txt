1
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:06,993
AT ITS DISCRETION.

2
00:00:06,993 --> 00:00:07,360
>>> ALSO.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,796
BRIAN: NUCLEAR TESTS AS EARLY AS

4
00:00:09,796 --> 00:00:10,096
TODAY?

5
00:00:10,096 --> 00:00:11,598
PRESIDENT TRUMP ADMITS THE

6
00:00:11,598 --> 00:00:12,766
HIGH-STAKES MEETING WITH KIM

7
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:13,767
JONG-UN ON THIN ICE.

8
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:16,335
AINSLEY: HERE TO WEIGH IN ON

9
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:18,305
THIS "FOX AND FRIENDS WEEKEND"

10
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:19,172
CO-HOST PETE HEGSETH.

11
00:00:19,172 --> 00:00:20,707
DO YOU THINK IT WILL HAPPEN?

12
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:21,575
>> I THINK SO.

13
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,977
ONE OF THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADERS

14
00:00:23,977 --> 00:00:25,779
PUTS IT AT 99.9.

15
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:26,246
WE'LL SEE.

16
00:00:26,246 --> 00:00:27,714
THEY HAVE MORE INSIDE KNOWLEDGE

17
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:29,249
THAN WE DO.

18
00:00:29,249 --> 00:00:29,983
JUNE 12th, THAT SPECIFIC

19
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,384
DATE IS NOT THE IMPORTANT PART.

20
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:32,384
THE IMPORTANT PART IS THE RIGHT

21
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,788
TERMS AND COMING TO THE TABLE

22
00:00:34,788 --> 00:00:36,656
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

23
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:37,824
KIM JONG-UN WANTS TO MAINTAIN

24
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:39,759
HIS POWER AND MAINTAIN HIS

25
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:40,927
PERSONAL SECURITY AND CHINA

26
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:42,796
WANTS TO MAINTAIN THEIR LEVERAGE

27
00:00:42,796 --> 00:00:44,197
WHICH IS WHY YOU SAW THEM CHANGE

28
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:44,764
THEIR TUNE.

29
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:46,600
YOU SAW KIM JONG-UN CHANGE HIS

30
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:46,900
TUNE.

31
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,468
BECAUSE HE WENT AND MET WITH THE

32
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:48,969
CHINESE.

33
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:51,037
THE CHINESE SIDE WE WANT TO KEEP

34
00:00:51,037 --> 00:00:53,707
OUR BARGAINING CHIPS, SO KEEP

35
00:00:53,707 --> 00:00:55,408
AGITATING T KEEPS US RELEVANT.

36
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:59,846
WE CAN GET BETTER TERMS ON OTHER

37
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:01,114
ISSUES AS TRADE.

38
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:04,650
STEVE: SOUND LIKE JOHN BOLTON

39
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,953
FREAKED HIM OUT, KIM, THAT WE

40
00:01:06,953 --> 00:01:08,788
ARE USING LIBYA AS THE MODEL.

41
00:01:08,788 --> 00:01:11,057
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT LIBYA, IN

42
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:12,525
2003, THEY GAVE AWAY THEIR NUKE

43
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:13,760
PROGRAM.

44
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,629
IN 2011 THAT'S WHEN ESSENTIALLY

45
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,897
GADHAFI WAS KILLED AND DRAGGED

46
00:01:17,897 --> 00:01:18,932
THROUGH THE STREETS.

47
00:01:18,932 --> 00:01:23,303
>> JOHN BOLTON WAS RIGHT AND

48
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:23,770
EXAMPLE.

49
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,305
MUAMMAR QADDAFI ENDED UP IN A

50
00:01:25,305 --> 00:01:27,540
DITCH KNIFED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE.

51
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,977
BUT HE WAS CORRECT, HE GAVE UP

52
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:32,145
WEAPONS BECAUSE OF POWER

53
00:01:32,145 --> 00:01:33,146
AMERICAN MILITARY.

54
00:01:33,146 --> 00:01:35,815
WHAT HE SAW HAPPENED TO SADDAM

55
00:01:35,815 --> 00:01:39,085
HUSSEIN IT WAS POWER AND

56
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:40,954
PRESSURE THAT CAUSED HIM TO IN

57
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:41,755
THE TABLE.

58
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:45,191
BRIAN: NOT US THAT CAUSED

59
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,927
INSURRECTION IN HIS OWN COUNTRY

60
00:01:47,927 --> 00:01:50,196
BUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

61
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:52,298
KIM JONG-UN WANTS A PHASE-OUT OF

62
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:53,133
NUCLEAR PROGRAM.

63
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,802
WE WANT IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION OF

64
00:01:55,802 --> 00:01:57,570
THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND

65
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,004
IRREVERSIBLE.

66
00:01:58,004 --> 00:01:59,439
IS THERE SOME PLAY THERE OR IS

67
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,540
THAT THE BIG QUESTION?

68
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,708
>> SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS SOME

69
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,409
PLAY THERE.

70
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:04,678
PRETTY TOUGH TO SAY WE'LL LOAD

71
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:07,380
UP ON CARGO SHIP AND TAKE IT UP

72
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,082
AT ONE TIME.

73
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:11,217
BRIAN: LIKE UKRAINE IN

74
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:11,651
SOUTH AFRICA.

75
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:14,621
>> MUCH MORE ROBUST IN

76
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:15,021
NORTH KOREA.

77
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:16,790
YOU CAN'T COMMIT THE SINS OF THE

78
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,490
IRAN DEAL.

79
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,925
IF ONE ADMINISTRATION

80
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,060
UNDERSTANDS THAT, IT IS THIS

81
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,326
ONE.

82
00:02:20,326 --> 00:02:21,628
NO MONEY RELIEF.

83
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:22,996
NO SANCTIONS RELIEF.

84
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:24,597
WE'LL NOT PUT A SUNSET CLAUSE

85
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,466
AND WE'LL NOT ALLOW YOU TO DO

86
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:30,136
SOME TESTING OVER HERE AND KEEP

87
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,672
THE PATHWAY IS VERIFIABLE

88
00:02:32,672 --> 00:02:34,374
DENUCLEARIZATION.

89
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,409
MAYBE THERE IS A PHASE TWO,

90
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,811
MAYBE THERE IS ATHEIZE THREE.

91
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,112
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS YOU HAVE

92
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:40,246
TO HAVE A CARROT.

93
00:02:40,246 --> 00:02:41,881
HE HAS TO HAVE REASON TO DO IT.

94
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:43,650
YOU WILL BE RICH AND POWERFUL.

95
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,118
YOUR PEOPLE WILL LOVE YOU, NOT

96
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:46,953
WANT TO STAB YOU IN A DITCH LIKE

97
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:48,321
MUAMMAR QADDAFI.

98
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:50,356
IT IS A DELICATE, DELICATE

99
00:02:50,356 --> 00:02:50,690
BALANCE.

100
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,357
MAYBE PHASES.

101
00:02:51,357 --> 00:02:53,393
LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL.

102
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:54,160
DON'T DO THAT.

103
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,695
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GOOD.

104
00:02:55,695 --> 00:02:57,764
>> WHY DO YOU THINK HE AGREED TO

105
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:59,599
THIS MEETING KIM JONG-UN?

106
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,601
>> HE WANTS A PICTURE WITH THE

107
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,569
AMERICAN PRESIDENT.

108
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:03,570
STEVE: HE IS HUNGRY.

109
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,839
>> THE SANCTIONS HAVING MASSIVE

110
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,673
EFFECT NO DOUBT.

111
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:08,241
THE CHINESE PUT THE SCREWS ON

112
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:08,541
HIM.

113
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:10,410
THE CHINESE ARE PLAYING A DOUBLE

114
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,244
GAME ABSOLUTELY.

115
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,846
THERE IS POINT WHICH THE GUY WHO

116
00:03:12,846 --> 00:03:15,081
WANTS TO MEET WITH DENNIS RODMAN

117
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:17,517
AND LOVES NBA BASKETBALL AND

118
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:19,052
WESTERN POP CULTURE, PROBABLY

119
00:03:19,052 --> 00:03:21,321
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE GUY WHO

120
00:03:21,321 --> 00:03:23,890
MURDERS HIS PEOPLE ALL DAY LONG.

121
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,892
PROBABLY WANTS NORMALIZATION.

122
00:03:25,892 --> 00:03:28,628
LET'S GIVE IT TO HIM.

123
00:03:28,628 --> 00:03:30,430
BRIAN: HE IS CONCERNED ABOUT

124
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,598
MILITARY COUPE IF HE LEAVES THE

125
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:31,931
COUNTRY.

126
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,565
>> REMEMBER TURKEY?

127
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:34,567
HOW COULD YOU NOT BE?

128
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,435
STEVE: PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

129
00:03:35,435 --> 00:00:00,000
STATES MADE IT CLEAR IF HE DOES
