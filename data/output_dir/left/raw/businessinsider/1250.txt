but if I win<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to instruct my</font>

attorney general to get a special

prosecutor<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look into your situation</font>

00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">but if I win I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to instruct my</font>

prosecutor<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look into your situation</font>

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,870
because there has never been so many

8
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,500
lies so much deception there has never

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,870
been anything like it so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

10
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,879
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special prosecutor and we're going</font>

11
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because you know what</font>

12
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,469
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been their lives have been</font>

13
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:00,960
destroyed for doing one fifth of what

14
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,520
you've done and it's a disgrace and

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,530
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ought to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be ashamed of you</font>

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,790
so obviously we have breaking news this

17
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,250
morning that Donald Trump's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

18
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,689
be pursuing investigations against

19
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hillary and the administration vienes do</font>

20
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,590
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll encourage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Republicans</font>

21
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,060
on the hill to stay away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that as</font>

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and focus more on their legislative</font>

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,409
agenda I think when the president-elect

24
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">who's also the head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your party now</font>

25
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,500
Joe tells you before he's even

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,869
inaugurated he doesn't wish to pursue

27
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,400
these charges that sends a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very strong</font>

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,040
message tone and content to the members

29
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,070
and I think Hillary Clinton still has to

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,509
face the fact that a majority of

31
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,460
Americans don't find her to be honest or

32
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,590
trustworthy but if Donald Trump can help

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,049
her heal then perhaps that's a good

34
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,810
thing I do look I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think he's thinking of</font>

35
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,479
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things as he prepares to</font>

36
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,710
become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the president of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

37
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,439
