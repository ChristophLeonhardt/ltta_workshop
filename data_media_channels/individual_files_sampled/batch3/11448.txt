a top Kremlin aid has confirmed that President Putin has received an official invitation to visit Washington for a summit with Donald Trump in the autumn Moscow says it's ready to discuss the proposal Donald Trump expressed willingness for a second round of talks after the two leaders met in Helsinki last week second meeting potentially with with Vladimir Putin yeah is that in the works is it planned has it been yeah I would say it's in the works look we had a tremendous discussion on many things but fact is we got along very well I think I'd have a good relationship with you okay let's go live now to Samira Khan in Washington DC Samira give us the background to this well from what we know so far the next time the two leaders meet could be at the g20 summit in Argentina or right here in DC in the nation's capital and apparently John Bolton national security adviser will be working out all the logistics the next time he's in Moscow but the last meeting the Helsinki summit that took place last week provoked a total hysteria here in the US the media accused Trump of treason just for talking to Putin calling him names like a traitor a weak puppy a Kremlin stooge Putin's puppet and even accused him of being affiliated with the FSB and the KGB so it was a totally outlandish but let's check out what else they had to say IIIi don't know which side is the bride and which side of is the groom Anderson but it sort of feels like we're on a wedding you have been watching perhaps one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president why is President Trump putting himself in this vulnerable high-stakes scenario and letting Vladimir Putin lead a man that even president Trump now says interfered in US democracy invited to the White House and now the president has apparently doubled down he's inviting him to Washington so let's collude again like we did last summer top spy in the United States he doesn't know how is that possible that the President of the United States is inviting Putin for a second summit in a couple months in the fall over at the White House because the president he works for is Donald J Trump despite media frenzy a new poll showed that the majority of Americans support the upcoming meeting between Trump and Putin and about 61 percent of Americans are in favor of improved relations with Russia so Trump and the American people seem to be on the same page when it comes to US Russia relations and not everyone shares the same enthusiasm nikki Haley contradicts her own boss on the topic we don't trust Russia we don't trust Putin we never will there never gonna be our friend that's just a fact so it appears that nikki Haley thinks that human concepts like friendship and Trust are necessary to build bilateral ties between two nation states but president Putin's take was a little bit different before the war regarding who can be trusted or not and if you can trust anyone at all I'm telling you you can't trust anyone where did you get this notion from the president Trump trust me and I entirely trust him he defends the interest of the United States of America I defend the interests of the Russian Federation so domestic reaction aside it looks like both sides agree that diplomacy will improve ties between the two superpowers so we're just going to have to see how this plays out yeah we are indeed thanks for bringing this up to date right now though Sameera can live from Washington DC well I spoke to independent journalist Joe Lauria who says that nikki Haley is undermining Trump's efforts and any chance of improving relations with Moscow well we know what side nikki Haley is on she's on the side that's calling Trump a traitor for going to the first summit in Helsinki and she's postal work for President Trump and in her very first speech at the UN she slammed Russia over Ukraine and this was just after Trump had said in the campaign he wanted better relations with Russia so she's been on this anti Russian thing all along she did say in that interview that it's okay if they meet it's good if they meet I mean she has to say that and in a way the American people are agreeing with Maria Betina this 29 year old Russian has been arrested here in Washington and her crime according to the FBI affidavit is trying to build better relations with between the US and Russia that was what her aim was here and they get quotes documents in which she is saying and that is considered a crime here because it goes against all the interests of powerful forces in the u.s. they're opposing Trump to have bad relations with Russia so I think Nikki Haley's on their side you
