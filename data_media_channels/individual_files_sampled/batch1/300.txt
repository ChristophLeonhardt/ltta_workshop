my darling daughter she cries she asks me when we talk oh mother what shall I do now how can I come back to you how will you get me out of India to be with you again my own accountant says her daughter Yasmine was 13 years old when she was snatched by a man in the refugee camp and smuggled to India that was three years ago nayana and he has mean fled a military crackdown in Myanmar in 2012 my owner says the trafficker was arrested in India and Yasmin was rescued her daughter is living at a safe house for other trafficking victims in Kolkata Myanmar stripped their hinder of citizenship in 1982 neither jnana or Yasmin have passports so they cannot be reunited my owner says every month she saves a little money to chat to her daughter for a few minutes in the phone only God knows the pain I experience every day she says I don't have money to go to India my daughter warns me not to try and cross into India without a passport my owner's story is not uncommon in the reinjure refugee camps rights groups say that trafficking gangs have thrived in the reinjure refugee camps here in bangladesh for years but the recent arrival of more than 650,000 and new refugees means the situation is getting even worse now we met a trafficker and he told us that men come from outside the camps they pay Ranger families for their daughters promising them work but the girls are often never seen again we sit by the road and the men come to us the man tells me they ask us if we can get the helpless type of people families are ready to provide girls because they don't have enough food the man says men often specifically want girls of a certain age he says they pay the families around five thousand taka about $60 each the men asked me for the girls around 12 to 14 years old he said they tell me they have difficulty with their domestic work at their homes they say they need someone to cook for them the man tells me he has stopped providing the men with girls now and only trafficked a few young women when the parents come to find me then I have to hide he explains they want information on their daughters but I have no information the UN's refugee agency is trying to help my owner be reunited with her daughter but it says only the Bangladesh authorities can make that decision my owner says yes men never met her father because he died before she was born she is afraid she herself may die without ever seeing Yasmine again I want nothing more than my daughter back she says it would be so kind of you if you can get my daughter back my guess mean is a piece of my heart Charles trafford al Jazeera COO supalen refugee camp Bangladesh
