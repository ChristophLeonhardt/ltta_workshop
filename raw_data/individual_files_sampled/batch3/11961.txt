hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle faced with frustration and dismay from America's allies even members of the GOP Donald Trump is sticking to his campaign promise to recast Washington's trade relations with the world the reaction has been loud and Swift are we on the verge of a global trade war cross knocking a possible trade war I'm joined by my guest Mal's Berg in New York he is a conservative political commentator also in New York we have Sarah Xu she's an associate professor of economics at the State University of New York and in Exeter we have Alistair McLeod he's a head of research for gold money all right crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate it let me let me go to Sarah first in New York on skype here you it's not hard to find the term trade war in the in the mainstream media corporate media here are those overblown expectations because I've been looking at a lot of CEOs reporting on on Bloomberg and they're keeping their forecasts more or less the same their investment projections moving forward of course they're mindful of this but I sometimes wonder if it's being a bit overblown you know Donald Trump is a larger-than-life figure go ahead Sarah in New York well right now we're not entirely sure what President Trump is going to do but that being said he has stated that he's going to implement 50 billion dollars in tariffs on goods imported from China and this is going to result in retaliatory impacts from China China has promised to impose tit-for-tat tariffs on US goods and this is going to strongly affect both the US and China in terms of consumers and producers and in fact we're already seeing some of the blowback from that China has stopped purchasing soybeans from the US due to the threat of a potential trade war they canceled about 63 thousand metric tons of soybeans by mid April and they're purchasing a lot more from Russia a lot more from Brazil and American farmers and Michigan and Iowa have already been hit really hard okay well if Steve here I mean obviously this air has already brought it up the blowback here I mean I guess if you're gonna get into a trade war and you consciously get into a trade war you have to figure you got more punch to the other guy or other guys because the Europeans are furious right now but they've been very much coddled over the last in two years and I'd like to talk about that I think there needs to be a redress of issues there they Sara's issue with China I think is separate but you know Donald Trump made a campaign promise and he's keeping it for better or worse Steve absolutely and you know China and and the the European Union Canada Mexico the the this this they're separate they're separate issues really in China I think the ultimate goal is not only to bring down the three hundred and fifty to fifty billion dollar trade deficit that we have with China but also to get them to stop stealing our intellectual property and and treat us more fairly in that respect so I think that's part of a grand scheme plus those geopolitical considerations beyond trade and economics that China plays into as far as Canada and in Mexico especially Canada there and the European Union they're really ticked off that Trump is using the pretext of national security to implement these tariffs on aluminum and steel in particular and that's ticking them off no end Trudeau has been very outspoken about that but I think when push comes to shove they need us more than we need them they know that Trump is a grandmaster it at at bargaining and and negotiations and this is all part of it I believe okay well okay no Steve will go back to that but III think on the whole you're right but I think the US and the Trump administration is under estimating the options others have in the world let me go to Exeter Alice to react to some of the things we have said here because I there's a very real possibility there could be a real trade war but I don't think we're there yet it depends on how everybody reacts okay and not just two words Donald Trump is good with words but see about actions let's go to Alistair go ahead yeah I mean I don't quite buy this story that you know that Trump is really having a go at Shriner and all the rest of it I think it is part of a negotiating process and I think we have to bear in mind that there are two things going on in the background firstly we've got midterm elections coming up later this year you're secondly there seems to be an ongoing battle within the White House between the established intelligence services it's to me and Donald Trump and maybe that the military on his side and so there is a sort of turf war going on which actually is all about geopolitics and I think we've got to look at all this sort of talk about you know trade wars and all the rest of it in that context as we saw over North Korea I mean Trump can get very very aggressive threatening to you know new Rocketman and all the rest of it and then the next thing we know they're talking and they're going to meet in Singapore and then it's off and then it's on again I think this story is going to run and run and run now I'm not actually wildly pessimistic about what Trump is is is doing I think that there are talks going on which we're not privy to between America China and also America and Russia on trade now when it comes to the EU I think that's a slightly different thing because the EU is the one protectionist bloc yeah I think America is protections as well but I certainly don't see Russia and China being protectionist and this idea that by putting up trade barriers or tariffs that you can reduce your trade deficit that to me is a complete misnomer because the trade deficit is comprised of the excess production of money within the economy and this is why you get the twin deficits effect and this is why if you get one country turning to save more than the other country you will again tend to get a trade deficit so it's those aware the imbalances start from and I think that's the thing that really needs to be addressed and I just hope that behind all this rhetoric that either Donald Trump or his advisors actually understand this point and know when to I'm glad you brought that up because they don't want to go to Sarah right now it's just in the what Steve said an ounce you're just set here there are so many dimensions to all of this I'm worried about the law of unintended consequences because China isn't the European Union they're very very different Sarah you want to make sure you want to jump in even after Steve spoke go ahead I think that there's a strong misunderstanding about what a trade deficit is and the trade deficit is not necessarily a bad thing it's not a win or lose type of situation when you have a trade deficit that means that one country is purchasing more goods from the other country than they are from from the first country and it's not necessarily a bad thing both sides have to have yet to gain and trade and the issue with the with China is that they purchase less from the US because the GDP per capita there on average is about ten thousand dollars whereas in the u.s. it's fifty two thousand dollars so as Americans we purchase we have lot more purchasing power and we purchased a lot more from China than they do from us and we win we get goods there's no losses there okay let me go back to Stephen in in New York how much of this is this political because we already heard mentioned the midterms being mentioned here is this something that Donald Trump needs to serve up to his base because as we've pointed out here his base in the process could be damaged I mean it's a delicate balance isn't it go ahead Steve it's a very delicate balance I mean you look at the state so that where the farmers are and the the hurt that they're feeling in many respects and could feel down the road but in that case Donald Trump is of promise to use a federal funding that's available to to bail out if you will the farmers he promised that they will not suffer I don't think he needs this politically for the midterms right now I think he's riding on the tax cuts he's looking to make the after the individual cuts permanent he's looking to pass that legislation prior to the midterms he's also has the summit coming up on June 12th or 11th our time if you will you know if you want to get technical with North Korea and he's talking about a summit with Putin so I think he has enough accomplishments and he's doing enough things to to satisfy the base and motivate the base heading into the midterms but this is something I've known Donald Trump to interview him into you know to have a relationship in that respect with him since the early 80s and that and then it was sports but when it matures from sports this is something that has always been on his mind the the the way were treated unfairly whether it's an ADA whether it's through trade whether it's with bad deals and he what he was he ran on fixing these things he is fixing these things and he's going to fix these things it's one big negotiation and we have yet to see where it will end up we don't know where it will end up you know if one day there's no tariffs there's no trade war next day he's he's putting tariffs on it's all part of a grand scheme he keeps them guessing okay let me go back to Sarah but you know it cuts both ways Steve okay markets investors don't like unpredictable unstable situations and I think this is what the environment we're in and on top of it the kind of rhetoric that's been used against China I don't think it's a very good negotiating strategy with the Chinese go ahead this is not how they negotiate this is they see this type of maneuver as a slap in the face and the way China negotiates is by making conciliatory measures going back and forth and this is something that is going to potentially Stonewall our relationship with China and have a really negative impact it also hasn't helped the stock market every time there's an announcement about potential trade wars the stock market goes way down and also companies both in China multinationals in China and down market go way down it then it would back up okay this is proving my point Steve okay we have these really good extremes going on here the markets are the stock market is doing very very well everybody knows that but when we made the announcement I think it dropped 250 points again this unpredictability that's the issue I'm trying to highlight here what's 250 points with those who respect in today's market of twenty five thousand two hundred fifty point there's nothing you see reaction okay well I'm gonna jump in here we will continue our shouting and discussing when they get after our short break we'll continue our discussion on trade board stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on pewter lamella remind you we're talking about potential trade wars okay let's go back to Alistair I want to read you a few words a quote here from Jeffrey Sachs we have a very well-known economist particularly in Eastern Europe and Russia not for the best reasons I'd like to point out he is described Donald Trump as isolating America and he declares him a psychopath trade war how do you react to Jeffrey Sachs they're calling the President of the United States a psychopath I think psychopathy is a bit over the top I mean he is I know he didn't get elected on the basis that he was like the other politicians but he is a politician and you know he behaves rather like one just maybe a little bit differently he hasn't spent a lot of time studying the book on the art of diplomacy he's got his own way of doing things and I think that's fine with you know we will get used to it it's not it's not a huge great problem I think the other thing is that what we see in the headlines of course you've got a press which you know having been accused of fake news and all the rest of it I mean they're not all that kind to the man they never were they're never on the same page as Donald Trump to begin with so an awful lot of what we hear I think we got to take with a bit of a pinch of salt the feeling I get is that there is a lot of communication actually going on between Donald Trump and President Xi and also Vladimir Putin I don't know this for certain but it just this is the way things work you have back channels and so the idea that this public slanging match if you like you know on the one hand it's going to be percent tariffs on 25% tariffs on something else and then China responding I think this is really for the public if you like and as I said earlier you know we are in coming up to midterm elections that I think is very very important so if you've got all this sort of stuff going on but I think at the end of the day things get sorted out in the background and I'm quite optimistic that this won't donate into something really serious I think there are other things that do worry me however and that's really over the isolationist stance of America it seems to me that the rest of the world is actually growing quite well without America America will grow well on her own because she's putting in a massive budget stimulus and that budget stimulus I think which current which will coincide with China's purchases of raw materials with the way the European Union is beginning to take off I think that's going to lead to big inflation problems down the road now that might if you'd like put an extra spin into this if you like trade tariffs type thing because it does this is bound to increase protectionism I think in Europe and also possibly in America okay then what is the role of the World Trade Organization I mean in again this is Western driven the rules were conceived by the West that China did join and a lot of people said took advantage of it that's a different topic and subject and program itself here but it seems to me when we have so many of these large economic bloc's or powers squabbling among themselves then the whole point of having the World Trade Organization it's really quite meaningless and what about NAFTA and what about if if it went brigs that happens what kind of relationship is the UK going to happen have with the United States visa vie the European Union I mean what I'm saying is is that it gets very very complicated there's so many different angles and different dots that connect here and then you have the largest largest economy in the world and yes it is China in the middle of it all go ahead sorry the World Trade Organization was created based on the presumption that the world was moving towards a system of free trade and the US was leading that ideological effort and now the u.s. is moving away from it and so the WTO has become less relevant in a way particularly for American politics potentially for the UK and elsewhere and I don't know that it's necessarily going to be something that people are able to ignore entirely certainly the tariffs that our president is attempting to impose on China as well as other countries would be questioned and possibly rejected by the World Trade Organization I don't think that it's necessarily going to become a thing of the past the World Trade Organization that is but I think that somehow there might have to be some reorganization of it either that or the US will have to go through another ideological change again towards free trade but that's not their direction that we're moving in currently you know Steve you know the United States see there's a long lineage of protectionist strategies that presidents have deployed in include grow and industrialized the American economy I mean it's it's it's been a big plus being very selective here but you know again there's the historical thing and I mentioned the beginning of the program is that after the Second World War Germany and Japan later South Korea were really given really sweetheart deals by the United States to grow their economies for geopolitical reasons of course during the Cold War no one denies that but the Cold War has been over for a long time and and it's time for the Europeans maybe you know in every sense pay their own way okay a NATO trade and all that I mean I could understand the logic of Donald Trump and doing this here the United States was very benevolent to these this part of the world because of geopolitical reasons not because we're all kumbaya and like each other no it was for good solid geopolitical reasons but those reasons are evolving and changing and everybody has to pay their way we all know what's happened to the middle class the working middle class in the United States it's it's if it's not suffering it's gone okay that's why Trump was elected go ahead Steve well I don't know it's gone I think it was suffering and I think that that's that's one of the reasons I know Trump was elected but but you're absolutely right and and Americans are fed up with the scenario that you just pour trade there they realized what we had and why we had it but no reason to really have it anymore and what I'm talking about basically in Donald Trump's terms is that America keeps getting screwed and gets the short end of the stick whether it is funding in NATO whether it is in in trade deals whether it is in funding the United Nations no matter what it is or the Paris Accords that we dropped out of it's always the United States that bears the brunt of the burden of the costs when there are other countries that can well afford it and don't pony up what they with what is their fair share and this is all part of the thinking all part of the the mindset of Donald Trump and an extends to these trade deals and trade in general and that's why you're seeing what you're seeing and his base loves it and so do the American people they love it they don't they don't want confrontation but they don't want to get stepped on anymore those days are over okay okay let me go to Alistair I I agree with the law weighs Steve they're sad to say but it wasn't you know this is not just state to state these are corporations and what we saw over the last 30 35 years is Western companies moving their production outside of the country making huge profits not being repatriated I mean the reason why we have these policies is not to you know the president has fast-track ability who wrote all those bills I'm have a pretty good idea who did in a word it wasn't politicians I can't remember the last time any politician actually wrote legislation was always a lobbyist go ahead Alistair net Exeter yeah you're absolutely right about lobbyists and I think lobbying is just appalling and I'm looking forward to brexit so there's no more lobbying in Brussels as far as we're concerned but I just wanted to sort of go back a little bit and you know I think that sort of concept that Germany and Japan got sweetheart deals after the war they got financing yes but I don't think we should rubbish the effort that those two countries or the people in those two countries their recovery angry I mean that's fair that's very it you know and not only that but the big difference the big difference between between Germany and Japan and America was Germany and Japan when they borrowed they borrow to invest in production in more efficient production in production which people actually wanted to buy in the case of America they expanded credit really not for production but for excess spending rather like Italy today if you like a worse exact not quite as a bad example of this later today so you know in a sense I think I you know I think I think to sort of you know blame the the the Germans and the Japanese for being successful in the post-war yes I think actually misses the whole point about trade I'm not I'm not dismissing hard-working Germans and hardworking Japanese and really hard-working South Koreans don't I'm not dismissing that ok please so what is rapidly running Sarah you want to jump in that's the point of the program go ahead the u.s. is necessarily getting the short end of the stick I mean as you mentioned multinationals American multinationals have gone overseas and they've produced in China and other countries before that at a really low cost and then made a huge amount of profit in exporting those goods back to the US and other nations so I don't know that our free trade policies have necessarily been you know against our own interest ok ok let me let me go to Steve well where are Apple phones made because all of you disagree and that's fantastic let me go to alistair real quick and then I'll go to Steve go ahead Alistair ok now I think the point actually that Sarah was making is it's right I mean where are Apple phones made in America no I designed there maybe but basically they're made in in eastern Asia so you know trade is global and if you start throwing spanners in the works then basically consumers will pay and the rate of inflation in America will only increase if Donald Trump introduces trade tariffs it's really as simple as that ok Steve I'll give you the last word of the program go ahead how is this making America great how is this making America great 42nd Kevin McCoy Kevin McCarthy the majority leader of the house is backing Donald Trump on it on these his tactics threatening the tariffs he points to Canada for instance and says look how they treat our dairy products look at our wines which can't go in their supermarket shelves so it becomes a matter of pride it becomes a matter of being treated fairly the optics of being treated fairly as well a very important here don't overlook that okay well I'm gonna end on the note here and probably controversial for all of you you know I don't tend to see the United States as a victim in the world very often okay so let's keep that in mind and we'll see where this is gonna go we've seen the past trade Wars are bad for everyone that's it many thanks to my guests in New York and in Exeter and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
