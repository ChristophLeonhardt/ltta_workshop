so what does it mean to not take PAC money like so for people at home they might hear about packs but right but not quite understand what that means what are you allowed to take what do you not take yeah so a political action committee essentially allows corporations or organizations to bundle contributions from their members and channel them to members of Congress and can cut checks for $10,000 a pop and for members of Congress who care about the re-election and that is just about every single one of them this is the the surest fastest way to raise the money that you mean to be able to serve your constituents and getting to know most of these fellow members of Congress they're there for the right reasons they ran to serve their constituents they care deeply about the issues that move them to public service in the first place but they make this deal that I'll give a little bit in terms of you know access and maybe outcome you know no skin off my back to vote for something that doesn't really concern my constituents that's only going to affect the National Treasury by a couple million dollars here or there if it means that I can get reelected to do that important work that I need but it is death by a thousand cuts to our democracy and it explains the horrific dysfunction the inability to fund our government beyond December of this year to move forward on immigration reform to address any of the fundamental challenges that our country should be up for doing but has been incapable of because the system is so corrupted and corroded by all the money that has poured in over all the years and so for the last few years I haven't taken any PAC money at all because I don't want my constituents to wonder on the Armed Services Committee am I doing the bidding of the people of Texas or the Boeing Corporation or Northrop Grumman or Lockheed Martin or any of those others who pay to insure that their voice their perspective is heard in these issues the only voice or perspective that really should matter are those of human beings the people that we represent constituents Americans Texans and so by not taking PAC money that as you say frees me one from the perception and two from ever having that thought running through my head you know do I really want to piss these guys off they give me so much money it's so critical to my ability to raise for re-election why not just cut them this one deal vote this one way support this one amendment so I can keep that money coming through that's the calculation that countless members of Congress have made and here's the other side of it in the first quarter of this Senate campaign we raised two point 1 million dollars average contribution was $44 zero of it came from PACs and we out raised the sitting senator who is the poster child for PAC money who has a national fundraising base by half a million dollars so our faith in people was rewarded by people and 81 percent of that came from the state of Texas that was Texans believing in something better for Texas and so the number of people who are coming in to this campaign their belief in this especially the young people who will come up to me at a town hall or a rally and they'll say the only reason I'm here is because you don't take PAC money they're BS detector is as sharp and exquisite as any on the face of the planet they know when when this deal is rigged and they know that we're running this in a way to unring the system Rokon a congressman from California approached me on the floor of the house he said hey Bette though you don't take PAC money I don't take PAC money let's introduce a bill that would prevent members of Congress from taking PAC money I said that's great but I'm sure somebody's already doing this review I go back to my office and say hey find out who's introduced the no PAC bill and let's get on it make sure that rows office knows about it as well my team comes back no no one's introduced at this Congress we'll find out who's introduced at last Congress or some Congress before ask their permission if we can introduce at this one no one's ever written the no Peck Act in Congress it was Roe kana and myself doing it and it won't pass this this session if we're honest with ourselves but what will happen is if a Democrat wins in Texas for the first time in 30 years and does so by running on the issues that he cares about having the courage of his convictions and not taking corporate cash then that will be at least in part the model that other people run on going forward that's the way that we get packs out of campaigns is by winning a race without PAC help and that's the way that we help to get our democracy back so I think there's a lot riding on on this race and on the way that we do it but I also think there's a lot to encourage us by the success that we've had so far so just to what clarification because I'm really curious about it so no corporate PAC money also no interest groups even if they're good interest groups no unions no PAC money at all no no PAC money at all and and there are certainly organizations that have PACs with him I mean in agreement with their policy goals but you know I think the rule applies to everyone you as my potential constituent in Texas never want to wonder whether betos voting a certain way because he got a lot of money from a certain organization you want him listening to you at townhall meetings being accountable to those he represents being responsive to people not special interests not corporations not PACs no matter who they are I think it's so much cleaner so much easier and every cycle of fundraising where we report to the public where we raised our money from we get to put a big fat zero next to political action committees and I don't want it to be that way I want to be that clear and that easy and that simple
