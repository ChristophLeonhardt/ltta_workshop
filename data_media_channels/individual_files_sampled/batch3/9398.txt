JOHNSON, REPUBLICAN FROM WISCONSIN WHO CHAIRS THE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE AND SERVES ON THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE. JAMES COMEY IS A MAN WHO HAS PRIDED HIMSELF ON HIS REPUTATION, HIS ETHICS, HIS GOOD STANDING, BUT THIS REPORT WOULD SEEM THE SNIPPETS WE'VE HEARD, SEEMS TO PAINT HIM IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT. JON, I'VE NOT SEEN THE REPORT. I'M LOOKING ANXIOUSLY FORWARD TO VERY VIEWING. IT'S ABOUT 500 PAGES. I'M SURE IT'S IN DETAIL. MICHAEL HOROWITZ DID A GREAT JOB WITH THE REPORT. POINTING OUT HOW HE LIED TO THE FBI INVESTIGATORS THREE TIMES UNDER OATH. I'VE BEEN SAYING A LONG TIME THE INVESTIGATION UNDER CONCERNING HILLARY CLINTON'S E-MAIL SCANDAL WAS NOT ROBUST INVESTIGATION. IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO UNCOVER THE TRUTH AND LEAD TO PROSECUTION. IT WAS MORE DESIGNED TO COVER UP THE TRUTH AND EXONERATE. THAT'S WHAT JAMES COMEY DID. I'M NOT SURPRISED ABOUT ANYTHING THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORTS ON THAT I BELIEVE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE REPORT. SO THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY, WHICH CAUSED SUCH AN OUTBURST EARLY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION, YOU WOULD SEEM TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION. ROD ROSENSTEIN LIED OUT THE CASE OF HOW HE VIOLATED ALL KINDS OF DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF HOW THE FBI SHOULD ACT WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTIGATION. SO YOU KNOW, IF ANYBODY WANTS TO GET PREPARED FOR THE INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT GO TO OUR WEB PAGE AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE INTERIM REPORT ON THE FBI'S INVESTIGATION. WE PREPARED THAT IN FEBRUARY OF 2018. LAYS OUT THE BASIC TIME LINE OF ALL OF THESE EVENTS. IT'S NOT QUITE UP TO DATE. WE'LL BE MAKING IT UP TO DATE WHEN WE SEE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT. AND WE GET MORE EVIDENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WHICH IS SLOW AND COMING. THE WHITE HOUSE NO FANS OF JAMES COMEY. HOGAN GIDLEY TO ONE OF THE PRESIDENT'S SPOKESMAN HAD THIS TO SAY THIS MORNING ON "FOX AND FRIENDS." LISTEN. JAMES COMEY IS DISGRACED, A LIAR AND A LEAKER AND DISGRUNTLED. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO JAMES COMEY IS AT THIS POINT. THE BOOK TOUR HE WENT ON WAS DISGRACEFUL. PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AT THIS POINT WHAT HE IS AND WHO HE IS AND WHAT HE'S ABOUT. Jon: IS THIS CHANGING THE OFFICIAL WASHINGTON IMAGE OF THE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR, SENATOR? I KIND OF AGREE. THE BOOK TOUR WAS NOT A BRIGHT MOMENT FOR JAMES COMEY, NOT BY A LONG SHOT. LET'S FACE IT, ANDREW McCABE WAS MARTYR McCABE IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S REPORT SHOWED THAT HE LIED TO THE FBI. WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER THAT THEY SHOULDN'T LIE TO THE FBI INVESTIGATORS THAN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND THEN THE ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE FBI? LISTEN, I CAME UNDER A GREAT DEAL OF THE CRITICISM WHEN I TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLE CORRUPTION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF THE FBI. THE McCABE REPORT THAT THERE WAS DEFINITE CORRUPTION. WE'LL SEE HOW EXTENSIVE IT IS. MY WHOLE POINT OF THE INVESTIGATION IS TO MAKE THE PUBLIC AWARE, FULL DISCLOSURE, SO THAT THE FBI AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CAN REGAIN THEIR INTEGRITY, THE CREDIBILITY THAT IT NEEDS TO SERVE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. Jon: LET ME TAKE YOU TO ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S COME TO LIGHT IN WASHINGTON. THAT IS THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SECRETLY GAVE IRAN ACCESS TO THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM, THE IDEA BEING THAT THEY WOULD CONVERT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT HAD BEEN FROZEN IN AN OVERSEAS BANK INTO DOLLARS AND EUROS THROUGH THE U.S. FINANCIAL SYSTEM AT A TIME WHEN CONGRESS WAS BEING TOLD THAT NO SUCH DEAL WAS IN THE WORKS, WAS UNDERWAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? IT'S VERY PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD THE GENERAL CONTEMPT FOR CONGRESS. HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS THE FIRST ATTORNEY GENERAL TO BE CITED IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS. IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. JUST TOTALLY PLAYS TO THE NARRATIVE OF HOW DESPERATE PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HIS ADMINISTRATION WERE TO STRIKE A DEAL WITH IRAN, WHICH IS WE WE GOT SUCH A TERRIBLE DEAL THAT THE PRESIDENT HAD TO PULL OURSELVES OUT OF. DOESN'T SURPRISE ME. IT'S VERY SAD. I'M NOT SURE WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN VIOLATED IN DOING THAT. BUT CERTAINLY SHOWS THE CONTEMPT FOR CONGRESS. Jon: SOME OF YOUR DEMOCRATIC FELLOW SENATORS ARE SAYING THIS IS MUCH ADIEU ABOUT NOTHING, A NONISSUE. WE'LL SEE. I'D LIKE TO SEE IF ANY LAWS WERE VIOLATED IN DOING THIS IN TERMS OF THE SANCTIONS LAWS THAT WE PASSED. PRESIDENT OBAMA CREDITED FOR BRINGING IRAN TO THE TABLE BUT HE WAS OPPOSED TO IT WHEN THE SANCTIONS WERE PASSED. TO ME, UNDERSCORES HOW DESPERATE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WAS FOR DOING THAT DEAL. OF COURSE, IRAN UNDERSTOOD THAT
