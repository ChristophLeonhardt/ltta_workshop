let's take this to our local legislators and let's take this to midterm elections because without the persistent heat without the persistence of voters and Americans everywhere getting out to every election democracy will not flourish but it can and it will the March where our lives movement is ready for the next phase of gun reform voting starting this coming Friday organizers will embark on a nationwide summer bus tour making 75 stops over the course of 60 days registering young voters and educating them educating them about the most effective way to stop the NRA by changing the politicians who make our gun laws people don't educate themselves on who they're voting for what they're voting for and worse if people don't show up at the polls which is why we are excited to announce March 4 our lives rode to change a two-month summer tour around the country where we will go from city to city state to state making sure we are going to harness an energy the passion we witnessed on March 24th and turn it into action and joining me now are two members of the March for our lives movement and Marjory Stoneman Douglas students Ryan teach and Jaclyn corn and a little birdie tells me that Ryan you might have graduate did you just graduate yes I did just graduate Joey well congratulations I know the jacket you're still you're still a junior I think but yes congratulations on getting that cap and gown young man so alright let's talk about you guys a summer project because this is exciting this is my favorite thing voting so important and we already know that voter registrations in Broward County Florida where you guys live my former home spiked among young voters voters 25 and under during the week of the March for our lives demonstrations against gun violence how do you make that happen again we'll start with a graduate Brian well simply there are still people out there who are not registered to vote and if they want to have their voice heard if they want to participate in our country and have a say and what we have to do to make the change we need to make then everybody's just gonna have to register to vote absolutely alright so ultimately we're making voting cool they were making good and cool and ultimately we're making voting cool and then every single stop we're going to whether it be a town hall or rally or conversation or public display we are going to be registering people to vote we're partnering with head count and Rock the Vote and other voter registration programs and we are going to be visiting the 27 congressional districts in Florida and over 70 districts around the nation and making sure every single person that attends our events is registered to vote and Jackie you guys have already been you know we've already started to see younger people taking a greater interest in making change by voting by registering and voting just in Florida new voter registrations among voters under 26 years old going up up up right every month we're seeing that but we still have this challenge I'll start with you on this John Jack I know we have a little bit of a delay voter turnout in midterm elections versus presidentials goes down anyway right it already goes down but it does go down particularly among younger people they just don't see the participate in midterms give us the case that you're making when you're talking to your peers about why they should vote in midterms well midterm elections are ultimately just as important as presidential elections even more so because those the decisions that Congress makes are ultimately what just runs this country and people need to understand and be informed of who those elected officials are because far too often people don't even know they're senators and that's honestly a shame because these people run your lives every single day whether you know it or not and we didn't know it before our school got shut up and we don't want any other kid to have to go through what we are going through because these politicians aren't listening to their constituents and you know Ryan we've seen one of the things that you guys have already accomplished in March for our lives has gotten people to really focus on the issue of gun violence in schools but you guys have been very smart about saying it's not just schools but the polling shows that people now in April of 2018 at least as of April is a couple months ago definitely feel it's more important to control gun violence that's the chart on the right more important to control gun violence then it is do more to protect gun rights and is already in the Second Amendment so you've got people trending in your direction but you know Ryan traditionally younger voters focus on presidentials they get enamored with you know President Obama or when Moe bomb is running and they're into that but then when midterms come along as Jacqueline just said there's so many more people that younger people just get bored of it and don't focus on it is there a way that you can translate the message you guys have had in March for our lives to get your peers to understand that no no voting for that Congress person is the way to change this I mean simply young people just really need to focus on what affects them and how they can be affected by the political process like certain things like college payments college loans and health care and legalization of various narcotics and drugs and things like that just things that affect young people and really just lay into their everyday lives that if they could realize that they could make a difference on those fronts then they'll look into the candidates that follow their viewpoints their belief systems and then just really vote in everything that they need to make sure that they can live their lives yeah let me I have to let you to respond to Betsy DeVos than Secretary of Education this isn't on your voting thing but I wanted to give you guys a chance to respond to her she was she was at a hearing the Department of Education hearing and she was asked by Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont whether or not her study of gun violence in schools will include guns take a listen will your commission look at the role of firearms as it relates to gun violence in high schools that is not part of the Commission's charged per se I see so you so you're studying gun violence but not considering the role of guns we're actually studying school safety and how we can ensure our students are safe and your reaction Jacqueline and then Ryan ultimately Betsy DeVos needs to understand that there have been over 20 school shootings in 2018 alone and if our Secretary of Education fails to recognize the role that guns play in our schools she doesn't represent the students of America I I lost all respect for Miss DeVos after she visited our school after our tragedy she came in one morning to secretly just lurk the halls I was a part of the school TV production program so I had to film her going about this she would whisper to staff members she would sit down with grieving students when they were in a private counseling session fully breaking the privacy that these students needed after they lost their friends and I just can't respect that she wouldn't even look at one of the leading causes of just death in schools which shouldn't be a classic thing in America this shouldn't be a classic thing in the 21st century that we were talking about how many kids are dying in schools and how to stop it let alone ignoring something as obvious as the gun yeah well I have to say I have to commend both of you you guys are using part of your summer vacation to do good things to do important things to register people to vote if you guys ever run for office I suspect that either of you you get elected to pretty much anything you want it you guys can do anything you want in your futures thank you so much have a great summer we're gonna keep following what you're doing Ryan D and Jacqueline Korn thank you thank you thank you thank you have a great day and coming up in our next hour those kids are awesome Trump
