there are lots of myths in in psychology things that people believe that simply there's no academic research form when it comes to brainstorming right now around the world companies all been getting together to kick around some ideas and generate some new thoughts a terrible terrible idea if you look at the research on brainstorming it decreases the number of ideas and the originality of those ideas by around about 20 percent why because women we all get together the most dominant people take charge of the meeting and who knew they're not the most creative people in the world so a very very simple change which is that you ask people to brainstorm on their own to come up with three innovative solutions before they get together and then when you get together you go around the group and everyone talks about their solutions no matter how crazy actually increases innovation and creativity so again a very very simple change a very easy change but a very powerful one when it comes to meetings often we all like to sit around and we all like quite frankly to waste a great deal of time so if you stand up in a meeting understanding meeting it doesn't reduce productivity what it does do is massively reduce the time of the meeting people want to be out of that room quickly so they're just as productive in a much much shorter time also if you think that a colleague or maybe a client is not being entirely straight with you what's the best thing to do in order to try and find out they're being economical with the truth well when you look at the amount of lying across different types of communication you see people lie a lot face-to-face a little bit less on the phone a little bit in texting but absolutely not in emails only around about 10 percent of emails carry a lie because people don't want to commit themselves to to print and so if you think someone isn't being entirely straight with you just say all can you email me about that and instantly you'll find out whether or not they're being economical with the truth at the moment we're trying to cut down on sleep as much as possible there's an epidemic of sleeplessness and sleep is absolutely vital I underpins productivity and the pimps focus it underpins creativity and what's happening right at the moment we're taking our smartphones to debate often put him on a bedside table and treating them as alarm clocks and then of course in the middle of the night you wake up I think I just check social media whatever it is and you get this blast of light which actually contains blue light which is very disruptive for the production of melatonin which is essential for sleep and then it really messes up the rest of the night so the value sleep if there's any way of incorporating you know a 20-minute nap into the middle of the day really good for productivity businesses should be doing that value sleep
