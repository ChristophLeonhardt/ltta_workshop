when the mosques throughout China
reopened after having been closed by the
Communist Party in 1959
the 1966 Cultural Revolution had led to
the destruction of more than 29,000
mosques throughout China and the death
of untold numbers of Muslims across the

despite the persecution Islam survived

the northern route of the famous Silk
Road originally started here in Xi'an
and today it is the symbolic center of
Islam where the first mosque in China
was built
the Muslims here are from the Chinese
ethnic minority called

capital of the Chinese Empire they have
one of China's most ancient mosques in
their neighborhood the great mosque of
xi'an measuring 12,000 square feet the
great mosque is one of the oldest and
most renowned mosques in the country
the xi'an muslims are very proud of this
precious legacy and it is the center of
their religious life

faithful flock to perform their daily

part of a group of 251 pilgrims leaving
for the Hajj from the city of Xian as
the community is so closely knit
practically everyone knows who is going
from their neighborhood
the pilgrims do not get any special
subsidies from the government to perform
the Hajj for those who are not well-off
it's a matter of saving throughout their
lifetime
until they can afford the trip
it's the day of departure at the
household of mr. and mrs. JA relatives
and friends come to bid them farewell
the couple's youngest daughter is not
feeling well and is overcome with
emotion at her parents leaving home mr.
and mrs. JA are both the anchor and
pillar of the household their children
are finding it difficult to deal with
their impending absence
with the time to depart drawing close
the couple's eldest son Ren ping has to
pull his parents away from the
well-wishers so that they don't miss
their train the pilgrims will make their
way to Xian central railway station
close to the Muslim Quarter from there
they will take a train to China's
capital Beijing where they will board a
plane to Mecca
the day is charged with emotion ranging
from the sadness of goodbyes to the
elation of the prospect of pilgrimage to
Mecca
Ren ping tries to keep his parents
together while at the same time looking
after his unwell sister
for each pilgrim that leaves for the
Hajj there is usually a large send-off
party it all adds up to thousands of
people at the xi'an central railway
station
managing the crowds is a challenge for
the authorities
yo marmar is being sent off by his
immediate family as this is his fifth
time to Mecca they are well adjusted to
his absence
