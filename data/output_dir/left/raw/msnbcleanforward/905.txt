WHAT THIS MEANS. WHAT’S YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF

110
00:02:56,746 --> 00:02:57,979
WHAT’S YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS MEANS, BOTTOM LINE?

111
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,148
WHAT THIS MEANS, BOTTOM LINE? >> WELL, IT MEANS THAT JUST AS

112
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:01,349
>> WELL, IT MEANS THAT JUST AS HURRICANE SEASON IS STARTING,

113
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,585
HURRICANE SEASON IS STARTING, BECAUSE IT GENERALLY STARTS JUNE

114
00:03:03,586 --> 00:03:04,786
BECAUSE IT GENERALLY STARTS JUNE 1st, THE ADMINISTRATION IS

115
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:07,689
1st, THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING HARD TO FIND FUNDS FOR

116
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,490
WORKING HARD TO FIND FUNDS FOR ADDITIONAL DETENTION CAMPS, AND

117
00:03:08,491 --> 00:03:10,225
ADDITIONAL DETENTION CAMPS, AND OF COURSE THIS IS ALL PART OF

118
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,059
OF COURSE THIS IS ALL PART OF THE CHILD SEPARATION POLICY.

119
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,394
THE CHILD SEPARATION POLICY. AND THAT’S HOW THIS INFORMATION

120
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:13,662
AND THAT’S HOW THIS INFORMATION CAME INTO MY HANDS, BECAUSE OF

121
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:15,497
CAME INTO MY HANDS, BECAUSE OF MY WORK ON THIS ISSUE OF TRYING

122
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:19,000
MY WORK ON THIS ISSUE OF TRYING TO STOP THE CHILD SEPARATIONS.

123
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:20,502
TO STOP THE CHILD SEPARATIONS. BUT IN FACT SO $10 MILLION COMES

124
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:23,305
BUT IN FACT SO $10 MILLION COMES OUT OF FEMA WHEN WE’RE FACING A

125
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:25,106
OUT OF FEMA WHEN WE’RE FACING A HURRICANE SEASON, KNOWING WHAT

126
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:26,374
HURRICANE SEASON, KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR, AND THEN

127
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,711
HAPPENED LAST YEAR, AND THEN LOOK WHAT WE’VE HAD SINCE, A

128
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:32,013
LOOK WHAT WE’VE HAD SINCE, A HURRICANE JUST BARELY MISSED

129
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:32,347
HURRICANE JUST BARELY MISSED HAWAII.

130
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,782
HAWAII. A TROPICAL STORM THAT ALMOST

131
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,383
A TROPICAL STORM THAT ALMOST BECAME A HURRICANE HIT

132
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:37,119
BECAME A HURRICANE HIT MISSISSIPPI, AND NOW WE HAVE

133
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:37,886
MISSISSIPPI, AND NOW WE HAVE THIS HURRICANE FLORENCE BEARING

134
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,721
THIS HURRICANE FLORENCE BEARING DOWN ON THE CAROLINAS.

135
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:40,488
DOWN ON THE CAROLINAS. I FIND IT EXTRAORDINARY.

136
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,224
I FIND IT EXTRAORDINARY. AND BY THE WAY, RACHEL, THE

137
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,625

CHART I HAVE IN MY HAND RIGHT HERE.

140
00:03:46,662 --> 00:03:49,764
HERE. IT SAYS THAT MONEY CAME FROM

141
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:50,699
IT SAYS THAT MONEY CAME FROM RESPONSE AND RECOVERY RIGHT ON

142
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,033
RESPONSE AND RECOVERY RIGHT ON IT.

143
00:03:51,034 --> 00:03:53,835
IT. SO I WOULD DISPUTE THE STATEMENT

144
00:03:53,837 --> 00:03:55,637
SO I WOULD DISPUTE THE STATEMENT THAT THIS HAS NO BEARING ON

145
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:56,338
THAT THIS HAS NO BEARING ON ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES FROM

146
00:03:56,372 --> 00:03:58,340
ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES FROM HURRICANES.

147

166
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:36,445
FROM YOUR WORK ON THE FAMILY SEPARATION POLICY.

167
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,180
SEPARATION POLICY. YOU DID GROUNDBREAKING WORK

168
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,381
YOU DID GROUNDBREAKING WORK EXPOSING THAT TO THE PUBLIC.

169
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:40,883
EXPOSING THAT TO THE PUBLIC. YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON TO

00:04:40,884 --> 00:04:42,184
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON TO COME OUT AND SAY THAT YOU’D BEEN

173
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:45,788
THESE FACILITIES AND SEEN KIDS IN CAGES.

174
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:48,691
IN CAGES. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

175
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,493
IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S

176
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:52,228
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S POLICY TO START SEPARATING

177
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:53,696
POLICY TO START SEPARATING FAMILIES, TO START TAKING KIDS

178
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,164
FAMILIES, TO START TAKING KIDS AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS, TO

179
00:04:55,165 --> 00:04:56,499
AWAY FROM THEIR PARENTS, TO START THAT NEW EFFORT THAT THEY

180
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,835
START THAT NEW EFFORT THAT THEY DID THIS YEAR, THAT MIGHT HAVE

181
00:04:58,869 --> 00:04:59,702
DID THIS YEAR, THAT MIGHT HAVE NECESSITATED THIS INCREASE IN

182
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:00,703
NECESSITATED THIS INCREASE IN FUNDS BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T

183
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:02,738
FUNDS BECAUSE THEY DIDN’T OTHERWISE GET THAT FUNDED BY

184
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:03,105
OTHERWISE GET THAT FUNDED BY CONGRESS?

185
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,373
CONGRESS? >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

186
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,309
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY. IT SEEMS VERY CONNECTED BECAUSE

187
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,278
IT SEEMS VERY CONNECTED BECAUSE IT WAS IN A SPEECH IN MAY 7th

188
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,514
IT WAS IN A SPEECH IN MAY 7th THAT JEFF SESSIONS ANNOUNCED

189
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:12,348
THAT JEFF SESSIONS ANNOUNCED THIS NEW POLICY.

190
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,116
THIS NEW POLICY. IT ACTUALLY STARTED A LITTLE BIT

191
00:05:14,117 --> 00:05:15,017
IT ACTUALLY STARTED A LITTLE BIT EARLIER, A MONTH EARLIER.

192
00:05:15,051 --> 00:05:16,719
EARLIER, A MONTH EARLIER. BUT CLEARLY THEY WERE SAYING IF

193
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,454
BUT CLEARLY THEY WERE SAYING IF WE’RE GOING TO START ARRESTING

194
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:19,822
WE’RE GOING TO START ARRESTING AS A CRIMINAL MATTER AND

195
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:22,458
AS A CRIMINAL MATTER AND DETAINING PEOPLE, WE NEED TO

196
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,126
DETAINING PEOPLE, WE NEED TO HAVE MUCH BIGGER DETENTION

197
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,593
HAVE MUCH BIGGER DETENTION CAMPS.

198
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,128
CAMPS. OH, WELL, WE BETTER GET SOME

199
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:25,962
OH, WELL, WE BETTER GET SOME MORE MONEY INTO THAT.

200
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:27,330
MORE MONEY INTO THAT. AND NOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

201
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:29,932
AND NOW THE ADMINISTRATION HAS JUST PUT OUT A DRAFT REGULATION

202
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,535
JUST PUT OUT A DRAFT REGULATION IN WHICH THEY INTEND TO

203
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:34,837
IN WHICH THEY INTEND TO ESTABLISH INTERNMENT CAMPS TO

204
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:37,340
ESTABLISH INTERNMENT CAMPS TO LOCK UP CHILDREN BEHIND BARBED

205
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:37,640
LOCK UP CHILDREN BEHIND BARBED WIRE.

206
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,642
WIRE. SO WE’RE GOING FROM THE

207
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:40,843
SO WE’RE GOING FROM THE HORRENDOUS POLICY OF RIPPING

208
00:05:40,844 --> 00:05:42,611
HORRENDOUS POLICY OF RIPPING CHILDREN OUT OF THEIR PARENTS’

209
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:44,647
CHILDREN OUT OF THEIR PARENTS’ ARMS, AND OF COURSE WE’RE STILL

210
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:46,149
ARMS, AND OF COURSE WE’RE STILL TRYING TO REUNIFY ALL THOSE

211
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,851
TRYING TO REUNIFY ALL THOSE FAMILIES, TO A NEW STRATEGY OF

212
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,687
FAMILIES, TO A NEW STRATEGY OF BUILDING INTERNMENT CAMPS THAT

213
00:05:51,722 --> 00:05:52,455
BUILDING INTERNMENT CAMPS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE SAME

214
00:05:52,456 --> 00:05:53,756
WOULD BE FUNDED THROUGH THE SAME ACCOUNT THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD

215
00:05:53,757 --> 00:05:54,957
ACCOUNT THAT THESE FUNDS WOULD GO THROUGH I.C.E.

216
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,359
GO THROUGH I.C.E. >> INTERNMENT CAMPS FOR KIDS WHO

217
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,261
>> INTERNMENT CAMPS FOR KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF CRIMES?

218
00:05:58,262 --> 00:06:01,131
HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF CRIMES? OF KIDS WHO ARE IN TROUBLE IN

219
00:06:01,132 --> 00:06:03,633
OF KIDS WHO ARE IN TROUBLE IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE OF

220
00:06:03,635 --> 00:06:04,667
THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM BECAUSE OF SOME CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, OR

221
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,235
SOME CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, OR SIMPLY KIDS WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS?

222
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:08,371
SIMPLY KIDS WHO ARE IMMIGRANTS? >> KIDS WHO SIMPLY ARE PART OF A

223
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:08,705
>> KIDS WHO SIMPLY ARE PART OF A FAMILY.

224
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,573
FAMILY. SO THIS IS FAMILY INTERNMENT

225
00:06:10,574 --> 00:06:10,873
SO THIS IS FAMILY INTERNMENT CAMPS.

226
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:11,841
CAMPS. AND WE HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING

227
00:06:11,843 --> 00:06:13,877
AND WE HAVEN’T DONE ANYTHING LIKE THAT SINCE WORLD WAR II.

228
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:14,978
LIKE THAT SINCE WORLD WAR II. IT’S ABSOLUTELY COMES FROM A

229
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:17,113
IT’S ABSOLUTELY COMES FROM A DARK AND EVIL PLACE IN THE HEART

230
00:06:17,148 --> 00:06:18,181
DARK AND EVIL PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS ADMINISTRATION.

231
00:06:18,216 --> 00:06:19,549
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. THEY’RE GOING FROM ONE STRATEGY

232
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:22,485
THEY’RE GOING FROM ONE STRATEGY OF INFLICTING TRAUMA ON CHILDREN

233
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:23,386
OF INFLICTING TRAUMA ON CHILDREN TO ANOTHER A NEW STRATEGY THAT

234
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,421
TO ANOTHER A NEW STRATEGY THAT THEY’RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT TO

235
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,957
THEY’RE TRYING TO IMPLEMENT TO INFLICT TRAUMA ON CHILDREN, ALL

236
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,792
INFLICT TRAUMA ON CHILDREN, ALL TO SEND, AS JEFF SESSIONS SAYS,

237
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,727
TO SEND, AS JEFF SESSIONS SAYS, A MESSAGE OF DETERRENCE TO

238
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:32,095
A MESSAGE OF DETERRENCE TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE

239
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:33,296
DISCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO ARE FLEEING PERSECUTION FROM EVER

240
00:06:33,297 --> 00:06:34,297
FLEEING PERSECUTION FROM EVER CONSIDERING ARRIVING ON THE

00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,265
CONSIDERING ARRIVING ON THE SHORES OF THE UNITED STATES OF

242
00:06:35,266 --> 00:06:35,599
SHORES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

243
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:36,900
AMERICA. >> SENATOR, LET ME ASK YOU ONE

244
00:06:36,901 --> 00:06:38,368
>> SENATOR, LET ME ASK YOU ONE SORT OF TECHNICAL QUESTION HERE,

245
00:06:38,402 --> 00:06:40,003
SORT OF TECHNICAL QUESTION HERE, BUT ONE THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO

00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:41,338
BUT ONE THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:54,117
MILLION HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE BUDGET OF FEMA RIGHT IN

FOR WHOO APPEARS TO BE DETENTION PROGRAMS FOR IMMIGRANTS.

259
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,394
PROGRAMS FOR IMMIGRANTS. ARE THERE POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES

260
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:03,727
ARE THERE POTENTIAL LEGAL ISSUES HERE?

261
00:07:03,728 --> 00:07:05,829
HERE? I KNOW THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY

262
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,597
I KNOW THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY IN BUDGETING AND THAT’S SORT OF

263
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,532
IN BUDGETING AND THAT’S SORT OF BAKED INTO THE WAY THE

264
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,400
BAKED INTO THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT RUNS.

265
00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:11,401
GOVERNMENT RUNS. BUT IS THERE A LEGAL PROBLEM

266
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:13,503
BUT IS THERE A LEGAL PROBLEM HERE OF CONGRESS SPECIFICALLY

267
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:14,838
HERE OF CONGRESS SPECIFICALLY APPROPRIATED HOMELAND SECURITY

268

00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:22,112
SPEND THIS MONEY ON SOMETHING ELSE?

00:07:22,113 --> 00:07:24,114
ELSE? >> I BELIEVE THAT THIS MOVEMENT

276
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,150
>> I BELIEVE THAT THIS MOVEMENT OF FUNDS IS WITHIN THE

00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:26,917
OF FUNDS IS WITHIN THE FLEXIBILITY THE ADMINISTRATION

278
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:27,217
FLEXIBILITY THE ADMINISTRATION HAS.

279
00:07:27,218 --> 00:07:28,752
HAS. THEY HAVE TO DO A REPORT TO
