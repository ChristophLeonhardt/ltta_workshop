a problem in Egyptian Imam says it's permissible for men to have sex with their illegitimate daughters and marry them yet are we even allowed to criticize such an odious viewpoint given that by doing so it might be deemed as an act of Islamophobia so Egyptian cleric Mazen al source why claims that under Sharia law certain forms of incest are well okay citing the prominent Muslim scholar Imam al Shafi al circe ye noted that if a father chooses to marry and sleep with a daughter who was born out of wedlock that's permissible because the girl is not legally recognised as the man's offspring and therefore she isn't really his daughter now the shocking claim by this Imam was actually first made in the video dating back to 2012 but it's recently gone viral it falls on the heels of another Egyptian cleric mut Fah Mohammed Marouf who made waves when he stated that even newborn babies could be married to a mature man given that under Sharia law there's no set age for marriage in a televised speech he insisted that as long as no harm is done to the newborn there's no problem preventing her from getting married I think I'm feeling a little nauseous right now granted even numerous Muslims find such interpretations of Sharia law as being repugnant but in this day and age of m103 I wonder if even flagging these issues makes one guilty of carrying out an act of Islamophobia the architects of m103 never bothered to define Islamophobia but just consider the definition of Islamophobia that the Toronto District School Board originally embraced for its Islamic Heritage Month that occurred in October namely Islamophobia according to the TDSB is quote fear prejudice hatred or dislike directed against Islam or Muslims or towards Islamic politics or culture end quote now I get the idea of prejudice and hatred being directed against individual Muslims as being reprehensible but according to the TDSB you're also an islamaphobe if you have a problem with Islamic politics or Islamic cultural practices politics and cultural practices that can be in a word barbaric thus if one were to criticize female genital mutilation or honor killings or tossing gays from rooftops which whether one wants to admit it or not has indeed become part and parcel with Islamic culture and there's that word culture or Quranic mandated hatred of Jews would such criticism potentially be a form of Islamophobia and now if one were to criticize Imams making the case essentially for incest and pedophilia would this to be deemed an act of Islamophobia this is the slippery slope we are headed down these days thanks to an unholy alliance between those who are beholden to radical Islam and the so-called progressives who serve as are useful idiots namely anything that is hailed in the name of Islam is good anyone who has a problem with anything hailed in the name of Islam is bad or hateful or phobic my apologies but if it's now culturally inappropriate to criticize incest and pedophilia thanks to some adherence of a certain religion embracing such practices well just labeled me an Islamophobe then for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has an all-new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
