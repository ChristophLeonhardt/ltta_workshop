the test of whether a story is a classic is actually quite simple it simply needs time decades centuries Millennia's thousands of stories sift into the abyss of time while others become immortal stories ranging from Gilgamesh Hamlet to the Lord of the Rings and movies are no different so I guess the real question isn't how a story becomes a classic but rather why why a story can transcend time or culture tonight's entertainment hello beautiful nervous I've seen now would have to become to stop men like him the night is darkest just before the dawn I promise you the dawn is coming we go now it's been a decade since Christopher Nolan released the Dark Knight which is a film I believe is a classic for the same reason these other classic stories endure they tell the truth I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood Socrates while on trial facing death famously said an unexamined life is not worth living and I believe the same is true for stories in film now this particular rebel story piques my interest when I stumbled across an article highlighting Patton Oswald's new theory on the Joker in the Dark Knight also listening to great thinkers of our time like Jordan Peterson who on multiple occasions uses this movie to attempt to explain and articulate deep deep ideas you really saw that when he burned the pile of money mm-hmm it's like no no you don't understand I want everything to be worse than it is everything it's like you don't want the money those guys weren't evil they were just criminals they're barely even on the path right because they you want your car they want your car they're their means of achieving it differ but they're in the value structure and the Joker character is like no he's outside the value structure completely it's no you don't get it I want to make an art of pain all of these discussions coming ten years after this movie was released and this really is the key not just people enjoying a fight scene or a great monologue but rather continuing to discuss the story over time each conversation bringing a greater understanding and application so why is that because the story is true no matter where you are or who you are this really is a testament to Christopher Nolan who wrote and directed the Dark Knight and though his movies have unbelievable iconic moments like the bank heist the pencil trick blowing up an actual hospital or flipping the semis truck in the street and the famous Joker interrogation scenes but those moments are not what make a movie last it's no one's unprecedented characters telling truths that to any generation are profound so let's look at the main players Batman's the Joker and Gotham Gotham which is us a city of people just trying to live their lives the best they can and this is at the core of everything good fighting evil for love wonder woman fighting Ares for mankind God against Satan for Humanity now Batman is an extraordinary man a prophet in a sense who chooses to give up everything body mind and soul to be a symbol for the people because as he says as a man he could be killed but as a symbol he can be incorruptible this is to save us now this is profound in and of itself this isn't just making some iron suit there is deep meaning truth and purpose in this but a protagonist is only as good as the antagonist he's up against now the Joker is and I would say without argument the greatest character performance ever put to screen not because the Joker itself is great that any actor can step into we've seen that happen and it failed my friend now Heath Ledger was masterful however an artist must work in the world given to him the greater the tools the greater performance is a very delicate collaboration between actor and director story complexities dialogue situations all set up by no one to let Heath dance in chaos which is really what the Joker represents he is the chaos to Batman's order and no one by no mistake speaks the most truth through this character for example nobody panics when things go according to the plan even if the plan is horrifying as you know madness is like gravity all it takes is a little push when the chips are down these civilized people will eat each other see I'm not a monster I'm just ahead of the curve The Joker's dialogue is satanic in its precision and true because it's things we've all heard or felt in our own minds the best example being when the Joker lures a hardened and disciplined police officer by talking about how he used a knife to kill this police officers friends but as a whole the Joker is saying these things about Gotham to us a huge thriving civilization riddled with the propensity of good but also the capabilities of unimaginable Horrors this encapsulated perfectly by Commissioner Gordon and Harvey Dent the two most noble men in the movie however one in particular is pushed tortured and tempted by the Joker and overwhelmed by the seemingly inevitable victory this evil chaos as seen by the people of Gotham giving in to it and when talking to Harvey the Joker gives a line that is so perfect and the genesis of so many other evils introduce a little Anarchy upset the established order and everything becomes chaos I'm an agent of chaos Oh everything about chaos it's fair oh and you know the thing about chaos it's bear no one is hurt because everyone is hurt equally this is post-modernism at its finest no one loses because we all lose in the end but I want to go back to the idea fear and how this evil chaos comes to power in this booming society Nolan masterfully creates a formidable enemy out of nothing because at its core the Joker really isn't a man yes he is but no he isn't he has no real origin story to speak of just cryptic stories that could be anyone's origin story and that's the point no one has seen by other great films understands the power of an idea how it must be grown organically unbelievably which is why all of his characters and technologies and weapons are all practically imagined the Joker really isn't a mob boss that required respect and organization he's not a powerful member of the community because he is insane however Heath Ledger Joker is by far the most powerful because we understand him he makes sense and earns our acknowledgment of power the Joker is just that he's the idea he is that push he's that satanic influence that manipulates the people around him the Joker is born by infecting the minds of the most desperate using them making them destroy each other for his own gain and then ghosts the mob bosses and uses their structures against them ceding distrust resentment and power and then into the minds of the everyday people with one instance one thing that happened one horrific instance of someone trying to do good trying to emulate the best of them who is killed how could this thing happen if Batman is good how is that fair and if it could happen to him it could happen to us this fear this idea grows in the minds of the more powerful people now judges commissioners politicians all fall into this madman's tear and he plays them like a marionette until finally the entire community would rather their savior their Dark Knight suffer and die because of the promises of an evil madman have you heard this story before abandoning principles and values that have saved us from unbelievable evil only to go back to the evils from which we ran and the cycle continues I believe this movie will last for generations inspire conversations debate and dialogues and even revelations with each watch and those special effects may out date or set pieces become irrelevant the meaning the symbols the archetypal characters this statements will remain relevant for years to come and this is true of the entire trilogy Batman Begins is about a man who decides to live sacrificially as a hero the dark 9 is a warning against the evils and principalities of this world The Dark Knight Rises it's a vision into what happens when our heroes fade our society becomes complacent we give way and let that tyranny rise it's movies like The Dark Knight that give me hope in a time where movies particularly Oscar movies will fade into the abyss of history as soon as you leave the theater directors simply telling the audience what to think and subject us to a visual representation of a begrudging Twitter rant instead of showing truths and letting the audience experience it give some of the movies that stand the test of time of re-watch and you'll see the same thing running through all of them truth I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood in awesome news like super awesome news you can now download the rebel media app and take me with you and have access to the entire rebel lineup you
