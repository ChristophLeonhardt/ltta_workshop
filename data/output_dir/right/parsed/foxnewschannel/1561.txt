IN SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA THIS
MORNING FOR US.
GREG.
>> HI.
IT IS A RAINY NIGHT IN SEOUL,
SOUTH KOREA RIGHT NOW FROM OUR
CONTACT THROUGHOUT THE REGION
INCLUDING NORTH OF THE BORDER.
IT IS RAINING THERE, TOO.
THAT MIGHT IMPACT WHAT THE
NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT WANTS
TO DO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS.
REMEMBER WHAT THEY'RE CALLING
FOR IS THE SHUTDOWN OF ONE OF
THEIR KNOWN NUCLEAR TEST SITES
IN THE NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE
COUNTRY.
IT WILL BE DONE, WE ARE TOLD,
WITH EXPLOSIONS IN THE MOUNTAIN
THAT THESE TESTS HAVE BEEN
CONDUCTED IN, CLOSING DOWN PORT
HOLES, COLLAPSING TUNNELS USED
FOR THOSE TESTS AND WATCHED BY
A SMALL GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL
JOURNALISTS WHO HAVE BEEN
HANDPICKED BY THE PYONGYANG
REGIME.
THERE ARE SOME NOTABLE
EXCLUSIONS INCLUDING ALL OF THE
SOUTH KOREAN MEDIA CORE.
ALSO EXCLUDED FOLKS THE
INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS THAT
ARE SO KEY TO MAKING SURE THIS
IS CORRECT.
IT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE OF A
MEDIA SHOW.
STILL SOME PEOPLE WE TALKED TO
HERE SAY THIS EVENT, WHICH
COULD BE HAPPENING AS EARLY AS
TOMORROW, MIGHT HAVE SOME REAL
VALUE.
TAKE A LISTEN.
>> CLOSING THE TEST SITE IS A
GOODWILL GESTURE.
IT HAS SOME SUBSTANCE TO IT
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE
WHOLE SHEBING A.
BUT HE IS DOING THIS BEFORE
SINGAPORE, BEFORE THE REAL
NEGOTIATION.
SO AGAIN THIS IS IN THE
CATEGORY OF SETTING A POSITIVE
ATMOSPHERE SHOWING HE WILL TAKE
SOME REAL STEPS.
IT'S A REAL STEP.
>> ALL OF THIS AS OUR GUEST
NOTICED IN A RUN-UP TO THIS
IMPORTANT SUMMIT TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN IN
SINGAPORE.
FOLKS IN SEOUL ARE WATCHING
THAT VERY CLOSELY.
AGAIN THERE IS A MEETING IN
D.C. TODAY BETWEEN SOUTH KOREAN
PRESIDENT MOON AND PRESIDENT
TRUMP.
SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT MOON IS
GOING TO WANT TO TALK THIS BACK
FROM THE EDGE A LITTLE BIT.
ONE OF THE FOCUSES OF THE TRIP
ACCORDING TO HIS ENTOURAGE ON
THE FLIGHT OVER TO D.C., TO
FIND WAYS TO KEEP THE SUMMIT
FROM FALLING APART.
FRANKLY FINALLY, GUYS, HERE AS
WE SIT IN THE SOUTH KOREAN
COUNTRY ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA
WE REALIZE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY
CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE.
STRONG, STRIDENT NEW TALK
COMING FROM KIM JONG-UN JUST IN
THE PAST FIVE OR SIX DAYS.
SOME TOUGH NEW LINES COMING
FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND ITS
