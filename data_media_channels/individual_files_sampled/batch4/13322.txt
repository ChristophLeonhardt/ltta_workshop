while paying tribute to a group of Navajo war heroes Donald Trump yesterday referred to senator Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas because she used to fake having Indian heritage to further her career Warren fired back with a furious statement saying quote great orange fathers speak with forked tongue two noble red men warriors I will weep no more forever on the Trail of Tears as I stand for my people against the white man from across the sea unquote Warren is demanding the president's scalp but Trump responded by threatening to shoot out the Senators eyes so her spirit couldn't find its way to the happy hunting ground and short the American government is working pretty much as usual trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show see Topsy is a teasing it's a wonderful all right array or raw you know I have to say for a a cynical horrible monstrous person like myself yesterday was actually a hilarious day I mean there was one piece of malfeasance and corruption and incompetence and rudeness after another I went home after the show and I sent most of the day just laughing and the only person who elevated things is Melania Trump which I'm gonna talk about cuz I actually thought she I actually thought she there's something important about Melania Trump we've been talking about morality as sort of the moral chaos that seems to have fallen over America that nobody can quite figure out what's right and we're trying to decide between some kind of individual guidance and morality and whether we need the morality of rules and how the morality of rules can keep from becoming a tyranny how the morality of individualism can keep from becoming Anarchy and it struck me that one of my favorite passages it's generally regarded as one of the greatest passages in all of Western literature deals very specifically with this exact question and so we're going to talk about that as we look at the insane stupidity and craziness that has or become our country which is you know good for me because I'm amused and I'm here to be it's like like my mother said to my father on her for their first date she said he said where do you want to go and she said I'm here to be amused and that's basically been my my code for life from that that time on speaking of which when you are going on vacation I hope some of you will be going on vacation for the holidays I'm a very picky vacationer I like to be treated well and so in the past I've always wanted to go to hotels but after a while my wife convinced me you know what with a rental property you get better stuff we started to go to rental properties when we would go on hotels and you get like all this stuff like and get a kitchen and get a fully stocked kitchen and get room for more rooms for your entire family you don't you know I hate I hate when you're in a hotel especially this happens to be in New York when I was in New York well I was in New York I saw this room in the hotel I was in that had bagels laid out so I thought oh this is nice you know I'll go in and they offer bagels so I go in and get a bagel and I did that for about three days and on the third day a woman came up to me and she said did you sign in for your bagel and I said what do you mean she said well this this cost money you have to sign in for it and I went to sign in and I realized the bagels cost $16 $16 for a bagel in the hotel so I thought like should I tell them that I've already eaten accidentally ate two of them I thought no that I think three bagels for $60 it's just about right cuz hotels know when you're stuck in the hotel they can gouge you but if you have your own place if you rent your own place then you can cook for yourself go out and buy stuff in the local place also you can just feel more like a local and if you want to rent a place the best place to go is trippin comm it's the world's number one site for vacation rentals with trippin comm onesearch lets you filter compare

the place that you're visiting it will make you a more of a part of it and it really is a lot more fun and now I know the hotel I was gestated is gonna call me up and say you owe is $32 for two big holes but that is true they do Goucher anyway we got to start with Trump in the Navajos I mean this was just too funny so Trump is got there now you know who the code talkers were right the Navajos they did they did this in World War 1 - they made a movie about with I think cage with Nicolas Cage was another I think they made a movie about him they were called the code talkers I think and the reason they used the Indians was because they had a very obscure language so they could turn that into a code and you could communicate and they couldn't the bad guys couldn't bust the code and they did this during World War one - they did it a lot but the World War two guys are of course the ones were still alive so I think three of them came for two for Trump to pay tribute to them he's paying tribute to them and this is what our president said you were here long before any of us were here although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago they call her Pocahontas but you know what I like you he's like what the hell is this guy talking about and of course Elizabeth Warren was livid she immediately put out this statement creature has a life has a spirit has a very I'm sorry that was the actual Pocahontas she's now working as a harvard law professor here was Elizabeth Warren the statement this was supposed to be an event to honor heroes people who put it all on the line for our country and people who because of their incredible work saved the lives of countless Americans and our allies it is deeply unfortunate that the President of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw a racial slur what Donald Trump does this over and over thinking somehow he's going to shut me up with it it hadn't worked in the past it is not going to work in the future I have to say that if these these the left is so uncreated this thing that it was a racial slur this was picked up by every single news commentator every single news place racial slur oh it was a racial slur observationally shal slur to say Pocahontas the only thing I was a little offended by was Pocahontas became a Christian and referring to Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas is kind of bad I mean it's Foca hot this can he get this right can't the president he's the President of the United States and his foe contest because she's a fake Pocahontas it's elevating her too much to compare to Pocahontas I mean so so they do this stuff and of course Trump knows exactly what they're gonna do he's always two steps ahead of them he you know you can say what you want about him I thought it was tremendously ungracious tremendously rude to do that in that moment you know that bring up his political battle in this moment where he's paying tribute to heroes hilarious it was hilarious it was absolutely I mean I laughed till I cried but still in real life you know it was rude it's a rude thing to do but it's not racist and when they pile that stuff on the those of us namely I would say 80% of the country who are so sick and tired of having race thrown in our face over every little thing they just make him look good they plate you know they are like they're like the Lions to the Christians going into the Lions devours them because they've got this one thing in their playbook couldn't they have just said oh he was rude it was inappropriate or whatever they want to say or just let it go that let the people make their own judgment so they come up to Sarah Sanders and they hit her with it and she had the perfect response I think most people find offensive is Senator Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career the press is getting she is driving Sarah Huckabee Sanders is driving them crazy because she really without being Sean Spicer without throwing the furniture without eating the furniture she just makes them look so bad and it is ridiculous she did claim to be a Cherokee this is a Ju know among Native Americans it's a joke that people who are not Indians when they want to claim to be Indians they all claim to be Cherokees because there are a lot of Cherokees and people can say that they're Cherokees she claims Warren claims that she never used this to advance her career but it's ridiculous you know she was listed herself as a minority professor she actually actually contributed five recipes to the I swear this is true to the powwow Chow cookbook published by the Five Civilized tribes Museum in Muscogee and she signed the item she signed the recipes Elizabeth Warren Cherokee I mean you really have to have no sense of yourself to do this so it is it is absurd and finally so they keep going in this racial slur and people saying the racial slur but the Indians themselves the Native Americans they had a comment too they issued this statement okay that may have been an overreaction on their part oh this is terrible who wrote this all I did I'm sorry it's not terribly racist Joe we're having you but the thing is the thing is in my in my observation everybody acted badly Trump is acting smartly he is being a smart politician because he is bringing these guys out if he is gonna win which I think he he will if he keeps up if he's gonna win in 2020 he just needs to draw these people out he needs to do what nobody has done and say look they're phonies they're frauds that everything is racist is not racist and all this stuff so so he's doing he's doing a good job but it was incredibly rude incredibly ungracious to treat these heroes like that so they have him on that and then the left acts badly too I mean the left with their lies and their charges of racism and Elizabeth Warren with that earnest little face you know that earnest oh it was so sad that the president the United States it's just everybody everybody is acting badly and then and then we have James O'Keefe now I have to say I've always liked James O'Keefe you know he's I admire what he does he's the guy Project Veritas he sends people in to well you know what he does he sent speak of ER people in to catch people out he had a tremendous success via Andrew Breitbart when he went after acorn which was a absolute con of a an organization still around really he didn't destroy it as much as yet but he did get a lot make it lose a lot of its government backing he has had some real successes he does tend just being fair he does tend to announce that he has some amazing story and it'll come out it'll be some guy saying some untoward thing and recently he's been going after the media and remember he did that thing with in New York Times where he got them saying admitting that there have been biased against Trump he has somebody at the Washington Post now saying that they've been biased against Trump but he pulled one off and it fell flat and he got caught he sent a woman into the Washington Post with a fake story about Roy Moore right the Alabama sent a guy who's been accused of all this all this sexual malfeasance and he sent a girl in to say that Moore had impregnated her when she was 16 and had then paid for her abortion and the Washington Post was on the lookout they knew they knew that James was coming after him and they got her so here is a a clip of the woman what's her name Jamie Phillips going in of Project Veritas going into the Washington Post and telling her story and the Washington Post reporter basically does what a reporter should do she she catches her and not okay and do you want to explain anymore about how it was that you you know how you came to to call us and you know I just saw an Oracle are both at work and are you in contact with other people you contact with the Roy Moore campaign or Steve Fannin or Breitbart or so did your do you still have an interest in as this says combating the lies and estate of the liberal MSM you still have an interest in in working in the conservative media movement to combat the lies and deceit of the liberal MSM is that is that still your interest no yeah no this is just nails I mean there's no way around this the blowback was immense and we'll get that in a minute first we will talk about another great gift idea especially in your stocking you know this is one of the hardest things that I do is fill up my wife's stockings because my wife got you know I have this great wife she goes off and she does it so much of the Christmas stuff and I sort of sit around and occasionally I'll say ho ho I will drink some eggnog I do participate in that way but but filling my wife stocking is one of the hardest things I because it's hard to find nice things that will fit into a stocking and don't cost a gazillion dollars but tracker is a great device that I use like all the time that you attach to whatever you don't want to lose and it will help you find them if you lose it it is about the size of a dime it is really tiny a little disc and you can attach it to your keys you can attach it to the books purse whatever it is you misplace with me that's everything like everything I wish you know I don't attach it to glasses because I think it would kind of look silly on it but but what do you do is you attach it it's called trackers TR ACK R that's how they spell it they leave out the vowel I don't I just think all these organizations are collecting these vowels for some sinister purpose there's some leave me a storehouse of vowel somewhere but they leave it as TR ACK R and the website is called the tracker com th e TR ACK are.com it's about the size of a dime you attach it to whatever you want then you have an app on your smartphone and if you lose your glasses lose your purse lose whatever you lose you press the app on your smartphone and it makes a noise it takes a sound and it's also it's like ways you know it also helps you find you can it guys you do it so it says you're getting closer you're getting further away and you find it and I do it all the time I've dropped my keys in on trails hiking trails and all this stuff and when you drop your keys on a hiking trail you are in big big trouble because there's no you're not only have to go back up the hill to find your keys but also there's no find your keys and that has happened to me as well so I use it for that and then if you lose the tracker you press the app on the phone and it helps you find the track of the tracker itself makes a noise so it's really really useful tracker is a great gift and during the holiday season you can save 20% off your order when you go to the tracker dot-com slash Clavin KLA VA and the tracker TR ACK are.com slash Clavin you save 20% off a tracker device the tracker comm slash Clavin it's very useful stunt very useful alright so go back to O'Keefe O'Keefe sends the girl in he gets busted then the washington post goes to project Veritas and does exactly what O'Keefe did to the New York Times editor right we played this on the show O'Keefe went to the New York Times editor chased him down the street the editor wouldn't talk to him and the same exact thing happens when the Washington Post confronts James outside of Project Veritas is that is they already have you been inspired by Project Veritas no we just wanted to confirm that the woman we believe is Jamie Phillips works for Project Veritas she code up she showed up here at this morning it's really cute you guys are borrowing our techniques we're busy right now well here's the here's the problem we're running someone someone who's approached the Washington Post reporter yeah saying that she was impregnated by Roy problem was that truthful or was that a problem the problem is you're busy so if you'd like to make an appointment please call our office for make an appointment okay I can do thank you we actually tried contacting the New York Times and all those organizations okay and they refused to talk to us so you know you could knock on our door and we'd be happy to talk to you okay but I have to run to this meeting right now okay and so I I feel again the James blue this right because the Washington Post came out looking good they checked the story now the fact I found that kind of amusing that the fact that the Washington Post would fact check a story became a story like the Washington Post was like yeah like you're a newspaper you fat check every story and people were people who were vicious even on the right people were piling on to O'Keefe as if he had done something wrong now here's here's my reaction to this because he did do something wrong if okay if he just went in to expose the Washington Post if he suspected that there were accusations against Roy Moore were a political setup and there's some reason to think that there's some reason to think that some of the more a political setup if he thinks that why not go in and this is what he does undercover journalism why not go in and try and expose them and then admit it if you get caught admit that no they got you you know what what what is wrong with saying that after all it's not like the Washington Post hasn't gotten so much wrong during the Trump Bureau they have gone insane remember they've changed their their little sane DeMott to democracy dies in darkness or they've become pompous sanctimonious buffoons for one and a lot of their stuff has been wrong they got what did they have that one story where the former Republican majority leader in the house made a joke about Trump being in the pay of the Russians and they reported as a scandal you know Trump and the pay of the Russians you know it was ridiculous they've done all this stuff that was Kevin McCarthy they said Comey was fired when Trump fired Comey they said he had been asking for more funds for his Russia investigation that wasn't true they said that Russia hacked the electrical grid in Vermont that was so the Washington Post had been absurd they there in their hatred of Donald Trump in their wild desire to do vengeance journalism on Donald Trump they have made themselves absurd now the story on Roy Moore has looked good to me I read the story and it looked like a really well sourced story the women were named the women didn't come forward they found the women you can say well why didn't they come forward before but some of them just sounded very very you know reliable to me and and mores of course his defense was not very he kind of later on he solidified his defense we'll get to that in a minute but if that's what he was doing if that's what O'Keefe was doing that's fine if O'Keefe was in the pay of the more organization or if he was in the pay of Bannen at Breitbart that's not journalism anymore that is Apple research and that's you know that's running an operation so if he did that I think he was wrong and people are saying people are saying you know well he was trying to get these poor abused women and make them look like they were Liars but he didn't do that he didn't succeed so I don't understand what you know like you that's like saying of the Washington Post I thought all women were supposed to believe be believed but you didn't believe this woman no I mean this is all's fair in love and war and these are journalism Wars going on so I didn't feel O'Keefe was necessarily in the wrong unless he was in the pay of Moore or Breitbart if he was in the pay a Moore in bright broad I think he was out of line because I don't think he should be working for anybody I think he's a right he's a right-wing journalist he has the right to fight his corner but I don't think he should be in the pay of anybody but everybody but this again everybody acting badly every single person is acting bad the mainstream media look like idiots they have looked like idiots since Trump got elected and they became hysterical little girls screaming at everything that Donald Trump says after eight years of lying on their backs like a poodle waiting for their tummies to be scratched by Barack Obama they just look absurd I don't think O'Keefe came out of that smelling like a rose I think he was wrong not to turn and face the music and say good gut job you guys I thought you were doing a bad thing but you should prove me wrong that's journalism too you know proving that the Washington Post is checking their stories that's journalism too I don't know why he should run away like a criminal and I don't know why the right should pile on him like he's a criminal we need people like this to expose the mainstream media they are corrupt they are ideologically corrupt and the fact that some of them are talented journalists makes it all the worse is all the worse that their talents of journalism working journalists working a corrupt way again with Trump everybody everybody looking bad and we'll deal with that a little bit in a minute but first here is a great holiday gift that you can't leave in people stocking because it's meat do not leave meat in people stocking

okay so finally we've got this back to the sex thing and I get tired of talking about the sex thing because I feel that everybody is a hypocrite and everybody is TEI even the people who are taking the high road and saying we can't elect anybody who is guilty of sexual malfeasance without taking into account the other person who is running against them you know I mean I think it's awful the way these guys treat women I truly do I think if a woman cannot get into an elevator in our Congress without feeling safe it really does bother me you know Cokie Roberts said that yesterday really does bother me that the press knew this and just covered up for them almost certainly because they're Democrats if we're Republic you know Republicans there were Republicans saying that since the Trump that Trump is dragging us all down as if Republicans were somehow morally better than Democrats especially on things like this it is very very possible that Republicans have behaved better toward women than Democrats have for the simple reason that the press would burn them if the Cokie Roberts you would never see Cokie Roberts saying oh yeah we covered up for Ted Cruz but every woman knew that you couldn't get into an elevator with Ted Cruz she would never say that which she did say about John Conyers the icon the Democrat icon you would never hear them flacking for Al Franken now Franken it thick and I he really is he really is a piece of work he's gone out and made these non apology apologies back in the Nixon era Woodward and Bernstein used to make fun of Nixon because he would have non-denial denials now we have the non-apology apology he can't remember he would never would she say I would never touch a woman's buttocks intentionally now I can't say that it's just which woman and did she give you permission so here is Al Franken doing an interview I just find this mealy-mouthed and and despicable here is his interview basically his apology tour Franken did unequivocally apologize for the photograph from that same trip that shows him smiling with his hands overt Whedon's breasts the picture that was inexcusable and that's the thing I'm most I think ashamed for then there are three other women Lindsay mens and two others who came forward anonymously in a Huffington Post article all have similar stories claiming that Franken while posing for pictures with them grabbed their buttocks they say the incidents happened between 2007 and 2010 when Franken was either running for office or was a United States Senator are they mistaken that their butt was grabbed is that what you're saying I am NOT saying that I don't remember these as I said I take thousands of photos I don't remember these particular photos all due respect I think people are going to look at this and find it hard to believe that someone such as yourself wouldn't know that they were grabbing somebody's butt I can understand how people would feel that but you know III can't say that that hasn't happened he's still a pretty good comic I have to say I always admired him as a comic and that's still pretty funny I can't remember you know I just don't remember the I remember that I've taken a lot of pictures with people but I don't remember the ones where I was grabbing the woman's butt at the time those slipped my mind and the Democrats the same people who are parading around going oh the horror of Roy Moore oh the horror of Roy Moore here they are defending Al Franken and John Conyers when asked whether these guys should resign because the one thing you didn't hear Franken say was I resigned you didn't hear him say anything even remotely like that clicky ain't going anywhere and they're using this thing the ethics committee has to has to investigate all these people which is basically where they send this stuff to die when they're not using your tax dollars to pay hush money to the women so here is a montage of Democrats coming up with their incredible virtue to defend Al Franken and John Klein do you think our Franken should resign I think that's up to the people of Minnesota and I do think we need to have the ethics investigation first what do you that do you now think that your colleague Conyers should resign from the house no I don't think the rules are different from anyone else because we see that one of the biggest isms that we have a problem with in America is sexism along with racism what do you think should happen to him should he resign that's the question that will have to be determined after the investigation obviously more than just an apology committee do you think you should remind from his seat in Congress well I really don't know your colleague Al Franken has been accused do you think he should resign I think that that is a distraction to be talking about resignation because what's really at the bottom of this so whole issue of sexual harassment is that it is pervasive so so basically no we're not giving up one single vote anywhere nobody is giving up any single vote Trump is being hit for not you know Trump says he's not gonna campaign in Alabama for Roy Moore but he's not attacking him either and he's saying we need the vote in there and I I have to say even the people especially some of the never Trump errs who say basically who try to lift themselves above this I don't think that that's a moral stance either democratic politics sullies you because the people who get elected from the beginning of time are are sometimes bad people and Thomas Jefferson it was not a great person really and although some of the stuff he was doing John F Kennedy people blame Clinton for changing the game by basically staying in office after he was caught that's not fair I mean John Kennedy was doing terrible things in the White House and in the Oval Office they just didn't cover it that's what changed the game with Bill Clinton was the drudge exposed and what changed the game with Bill Clinton was that the new media overrode the hereditary media the corporate media and started to tell these stories that's what's changed the game it's not that people are doing anything different is that they're all being exposed now not because of CBS or NBC or ABC but because of Drudge because of them of the the internet so this stuff you know now we have a new the new situation that we have is not that men chase women around desks that's not the new situation the new situation now is you can't do it in secret is that everything gets exposed Democrats Republicans everybody gets exposed and it turns out oh my gosh we're all hypocrites well we'll vote for the guy as long as we get the vote you know maybe we should have known that but it does create this sense of that we're in a moral morass it creates a sense that we have moral chaos and this has been going on I mean it is it's galling that the left which has been undermining our sexual morality for 50 60 years is now wave wagging his finger in our face and saying men should be gentlemen after it's just finished telling us that to treat women for 50 years that women treating women differently than you treat men is a bad thing so I've been thinking about this a lot I've been thinking about this idea of how we go forward morally and the difference between the idea of individualistic morality which I'm a very much in favor of and rules morality which I don't really like I mean it doesn't sit well with me and yet if you live in a chaotic lower-class neighborhood where the social fabric has fallen apart the rules can be a very very powerful guide for what you're going to do even even little rules that are it seems simple like you know the Catholic Church telling you what to eat on Fridays can be very sad or they can be very helpful and then you have people like me who say no you've got to use God and go for it and it suddenly occurred to me that one of the greatest passages in all of Western literature deals with exactly this question I'm often asked because I'm a novelist I'm often asked what my favorite novel is and I can't answer that because so many I have so many favorites but the one that novel that has changed my life more than any other was crime and punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and crime and punishment Dostoyevsky was as close a thing to a seer as there was in literature I mean he saw communism coming fifty years away he knew exactly what was gonna happen he saw the death of God coming and in crime and punishment he was responding to Nietzsche before Nietzsche ever wrote anything he may have written things but he hadn't published things what Nietzsche basically said was God is dead morality is now relative we all we can do is parse finally the genealogy of morals find out where our morals come from and the left has basically been following that and turned it into the philosophy of relativism and multiculturalism and thus tsq wrote a novel in which a guy basically decided to become the Nietzschean Superman before there was such a thing and to kill somebody and he discovers that no in fact he has violated the moral code that is in the universe what the Khan said Khan said there are two great realities the starry sky above and the moral law within and Dostoyevsky was putting that forward when I read that book I was 19 years old the first time I read it I remember that it changed the direction of my soul that was like a big ship turning in a different direction because I was surrounded by relative relativists relativism was on the rise and each Haysom was on the rise the new criticism was on the rise and I thought you know what these guys were wrong these guys are wrong and that ultimately thirty years down the road it ultimately resulted in my becoming a Christian and which also was what happened to Dostoyevsky but the sniffs he wrote another great book called The Brothers Karamazov it's a harder read and it's all I had to read it three times before I actually understood it you know it was the third time when I thought I get this book you know in The Brothers Karamazov oh if there is a passage which you can go out and buy separately actually it called the grand inquisitor have you ever read this the grand inquisitor oh and it's it's it is some piece of work it's better if you read it in context but one of the characters a very cynical character tell stops the story of The Brothers Karamazov and tells a story within the story and I'm not gonna read it to you because it's too long but I will just give it to you very quickly it takes place during the Inquisition in Spain and the Grand Inquisitor there burning people at the stakes and the Grand Inquisitor has just finished in Seville I think it is he's just finished burning a bunch of heretics Jesus the Christ comes back to earth and starts performing miracles and the people recognize him right away and they start coming to him with their health problems and everything and in fact a little girl who has died is brought to him and he raises her as he does in the Gospels he raises her from the dead and the Grand Inquisitor is walking by and he sees Jesus doing this knows exactly who it is and has him arrested and brought before the Inquisition and condemned to be burned to the stake he goes into the prison cell and the Grand Inquisitor confronts Jesus and he says you had no right to come back you have no right to add anything to what's already in the Bible and you are getting in the way of the great work the church does stopping people from being free because what you brought them was freedom and you did it when you when you decline the temptations of Satan in the desert in the desert Jesus has three temptations the devil comes to him and says if you're the son of man if you're the son of God change these stones to bread and he says no man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes out of the mouth of God so he refuses to change the stones to bread so the devil says all right if you are the son of man prove it throw yourself off a cliff and let God's angels come and do it in and Jesus is know thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God and Satan says all right well here's what you do if you will worship Me if you will worship me I will give you I will give you all the kingdoms of the world you can see them out in front of you and Jesus basically says pounce and say maybe that's not a direct translation from the Greek but that's basically what he says and the grand inquisitor says to Jesus all people want is bread they will say all you had to do was change the stones to bread and the people would have been served that they will sell their lives for bread they will sell their conscience for bread they will sell everything if you just give them bread and he's talking about communism he sees communism Dostoevsky sees communism coming down line says when you refuse to throw yourself off the cliff and prove that you're the Son of God you took away from people somebody to worship that's the other thing they want they want to worship somebody they want to throw their conscience to somebody else they want to make a saint of somebody else you refuse to become that person and you kept insisting that the people should be free in their conscience and when you refuse to take over the kingdoms of the world you refuse the third thing let me read you this is like one sentence just like the Grand Inquisitor says all that man seeks on earth is someone to bow down town down to someone to take over his conscience and a means for uniting everyone at last into a common concordant and incontestable anthill for the need for universal Union is the third and last of men men want something to be true for everybody and they want somebody to be in control of everybody they just want something to come together and Jesus by refusing those three temptations has forced the people to be free and what the Grand Inquisitor says yes there are maybe 10,000 people who will benefit from that freedom but what about all the millions we as the church who serve Satan we are in the sight of Satan we serve those millions and yes we take away their lives and we take away their freedom but we'd give them what they want we give them bread we give them somebody to worship when we give them a universal truth that they can refer to at all times I just actually was not he was a Christian but he was not easy on the Roman Catholic Church and and and this is a story that's told by a very nefarious character and they so it's not an authoritative story at the end of the story the Grand Inquisitor says to Jesus he pardons him he says I'm not gonna burn you at the stake I'm gonna let you go but get out of here get out of town and Jesus leans forward and he kisses the Grand Inquisitor and he leaves and one of the last lines of the story is something like the kiss burned in the inquisitors heart but he did not change his opinions it's a very so it doesn't come to any conclusion but it's a very beautiful picture of the quandary that we're in we are you know social media plays this is plays to your outrage why does it play to your outrage because outrage makes you feel virtuous outrage does exactly the opposite of what Jesus told you to do if you want it to be free Jesus told you not to look at the sins of the other person but to look at your own sins to look at yourself first judge not lest ye be judged take the plank out of your eye before you attack the mote in another man's eye all you get on Twitter all you get on social media all you get on Facebook all day long is the mote in the other guy's eye because that outrage is addictive because it makes you feel virtuous win you are not and that is the way we're being deceived we're being deceived by this constant perpetual outrage over some some of the things are outrageous some of them are not the constant outrage which makes you feel good about yourself and we're constantly looking for our guys to be Saints and their guys to be devils and we are all all of us fallen short of the glory of God and this was why Melania Trump yesterday was to me a shining star and when I say this at when I finished saying this you're gonna be so ticked off at me you won't believe it Melania Trump came forward to show the new Christmas decorations just show the show the new the twelve cut 12 just the decorations themselves first can you keep my mic on from because they're decorations themselves are just beautiful and she really I mean she's got a great taste and obviously you can see her walking through this it's just absolutely spectacular that is a gingerbread bread White House it really it really is beautiful and there's a fantastic crash in there which I have to say I I have to say compares look at this really isn't nice so so she come out comes out to the shows and by the way this is in comparison to the Obama White House tree we showed show number 13 yeah so that I had mal who Mart murdered tens of millions of people was on the tree and cut number 14 is Obama on Mount Rushmore just the promise and grab so the Obama tree was about Obama the milania's tree is about the White House for the most touching thing was he came out to greet these children and I don't know what they they represented some organization and she walks out to greet these children who just watch this quick cut she comes out and if you couldn't hear it the kid says to her are you the first lady and it turns to another consist she seriously looks like an angel and then they all she comes out to shake their hands they all run into her arms I think Melania is doing a great job as the first lady I am so proud to have her representing me and every time I bring this up especially on the nevertrump right they say to me you know this is a woman who posed nude and lesbian kind of pornographic pictures and that she was almost certainly a what's the word a gold digger that whoo yeah obviously she was a gold digger who would marry Donald Trump except for his money right think about it for a minute would you ladies and be honest would you marry a Donald Trump and there's an apocryphal story that she once said you know well yeah I married him for his money but he married me for my look so what's the diff I don't know whether that story is true or not and so whenever I mentioned that her past the people who loved her get angry at me and whenever I mentioned how what a great job she's doing the people who hate her and who hate Trump bring up that stuff but to me it's that stuff that makes her so beautiful it's that stuff that makes this so amazing that she did those kind of cheap pornographic pictures that she probably married Trump in some sense for his money and yet she has elevated herself into this office where this kid just had a vision of an angel coming out of that Christmas tree that's what you're aiming for that is what because this is who we all are we are all font we have all fallen short of the glory of God and until you realize that until you stop the outrage until you take a look at yourself then you start to realize what kind of complicated moral decisions we have I'm not I'm not hitting anybody for trying to keep a vote in the Senate over punishing some guy for what he did 40 years ago or 30 years ago or 10 minutes ago I think these are complex moral questions that each of us has to judge by standing before God as who we really are and what we've really done in understanding ourselves and then making the best moral we have democracy is a mess democracy is always a mess and it's sullies everyone who touches it because because you are free to make the decision this is what the Grand Inquisitor was protesting against he was protesting against the fact that when you become free when you make the decisions of who is going to be powerful and who isn't then you are going to be touched by the dirt of the world and I do not think that elevating yourself above that and pretending to be better than it and stepping away from it and making the choices look simple I do not think that that is a moral choice all right sexual follies I've got to do this fast but just away complaints over New Zealand Commonwealth Games transit gender selection Laurel Hobart Australia's weightlifting chief says New Zealand's selection of transgender athlete Laurel Hubbard will create an uneven playing field at next year's Commonwealth Games they have allowed in the Commonwealth Games a man who says he is a woman to come on as a weightlifter what woman weightlifter has a chance against this guy Gavin Hubbard the Gavin Hubbard before he became a girl Hubbard then 39 year old was a national junior record holder in the male hundred and five kilogram class before he or she transitioned into a so-called woman in his mid-30s rival athletes complained that he had an unfair advantage after he won gold at the Australian Open this year lifting a hundred 23 kilos and 145 killers in the clean-and-jerk this is insanity this is insanity I mean if people if you know one of the things that gets me about this is it reduces all of us to stupid that we have to have a stupid argument about it whether a man pretending to be a woman should be allowed to compete with actual women in a athletic contest that we should have an argument about that doesn't allow us to get into the kinds of discussions that need to be had about how we should treat one another how we should treat how men should treat women how women should treat themselves how women should treat men all those things can only all of those conversations can be only be had after we get past stupid and all this left this nonsense that reality is not reality just keeps us stuck in stupid hey the mailbag is tomorrow go on the website daily wire.com subscribe lousy ten bucks a month hit the podcast page
