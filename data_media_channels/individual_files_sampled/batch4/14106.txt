it's a cold January day at the Alberta legislature but I'm here to cover an anti Justin Trudeau protest remember the hijab hate crime hoax a young girl and her mother claimed that an Asian male with a mustache tried to attack her on her way to school with a pair of scissors and then put a 30 centimeter long cut in her hijab the nation was absolutely captivated the left-wing media did no investigation whatsoever and believed the story at face value so did Canadian politicians of all stripes including sadly conservative ones but the worst true believer was Prime Minister Justin Trudeau he jumped on this story of an islamaphobe ik Asian Canadian scissor wielding maniac as proof that Canadians are as hateful as he believes us to be but that little girl's story in that hate crime well it turned out to be completely false but the anger and sense of betrayal remaining in the Asian Canadian community for the slander against them by the Prime Minister is very very real the Asian Canadian community has organized rolling rallies across the country they're protesting against m103 the anti-blasphemy censorship motion and they want an acknowledgment that their prime minister jumped on the bandwagon to blame someone in their community for a hate crime that didn't happen before the police could ever even investigate so I'm down here at the Alberta Legislature let's check out what these protesters have to say why was it important for you to come down today I'm protest hi Jeb Hawkes and I think the Trudeau is should be the same poor chief for these Hawks why do you think he needs to apologize because he jumped to conclusion before the police get investigated why was it important for you to come down to the legislature on such a terribly cold day yeah I just wanted this one Canadian value back yeah I think that the extent that that the thing that it's not fair to any Asian people and not fair to any Canadian people I think it's important anytime for any Canadian to have the right to express concerns over any motion any mandate of any sorts in particular this one bothers me because it is isolating one group as specific victims when the rights of all Canadians regardless of their race or religion should be treated as equals it's funny how that's controversial now yes every citizens in Canada it's not put on anybody above any others like against I'm 103 discrimination do you feel like the Prime Minister should apologize to Asian Canadians for I think so yeah he has he needs to apologize to all Canadians he's his judge jury and prosecution er right there just by saving the statement that he made and then failing to say oops I made a mistake investigate how curiously come up they just like to make his ass like a bells to towards other people Kirksey he responds and sophisticated CLE yeah he responds to fast and then without say in any if we we need to think to wait the investigation he didn't mention anything of investigation he hum every Canadians heart well there you have it it's minus 20 on the steps of the Alberta Legislature and about 40 hearty and very proud Canadians of all different backgrounds have joined together in defense of Canadian values and in defense of Canadian free speech and of course of course there was one obligatory misbehaved left-wing kook shouting everyone down and following me around and of course preventing me from doing my job like a total lunatic until the boys in blue stepped in I bet that guy probably calls himself a feminist reporting from the steps of the Alberta Legislature I'm Sheila gun read for the rebel dot media now did you know that I have my own weekly show here on the rebel it is called the gun show and they actually let me be indoors when I talk to an interesting and underreported guest to get access to my show and the rest of our amazing premium content become a rebel subscriber today you
