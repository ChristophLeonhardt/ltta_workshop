so we Christian conservatives are very often accused of trying to impose our religion on others of trying to push our religion no matter what the topic is no matter what we're talking about it always comes back to that our opponent is always going to accuse us in the end of you're trying to push your religion on me and this will even happen when they're the first ones to bring up religion so I don't know how many times I've had a conversation like this where I'm I'm talking often to a liberal and they'll say well you know the Bible and Jesus agree with me on this topic I mean Jesus said himself that he agrees with me on whatever topic we're talking about and then I'll say well no he doesn't and in fact here are a couple verses that prove and then he'll say stop pushing your religion on me why do you bring up religion all the time I didn't you did so there's this weird thing that liberals do well they're they they will try to use their first tactic is to try to use my religion against me and when that doesn't work then they'll claim that religion has nothing to do with it and we should be talking about religion so this is this is the way it usually goes this is especially the case when it comes to the topic of abortion and now roe v wade which has been the subject of conversation obviously for the last couple weeks and we were again as conservatives we were once again accused of this on of all places Fox News yesterday when pro-abortion pundit Tommy Lehren took to the airwaves to declare on Fox News that overturning roe v wade would be religious judicial activism and thus unconstitutional she says and in this I mean this is a Nancy Pelosi level talking point the idea that it's unconstitutional and religious activism to overturn roe v wade is a Nancy Pelosi level talking point and right when I say Nancy Pelosi level I mean that it is radically progressive and also it is extremely lazy and incredibly stupid and I don't know how else to put it just lazy and stupid talking point and yet this one of the most radical one of the laziest one of the stupidest leftist talking point is coming out of the mouth of an alleged spokeswoman for conservatism like someone that people turn to for insights in the conservatism I mean it's it's it's mind-boggling what I think Tommy did us a favor by bringing this up because it gives us the opportunity to discuss why this claim of pushing religion by opposing the murder of infants is false and so I want to take advantage of that opportunity and there are a few points to make here so first of all let's um you know you know that roe v wade and abortion are kind of two separate topics they in that if you re if you are a rational thinking person and you understand how the government works and you understand how the Constitution works or is supposed to work and you understand how that Supreme Court works or is supposed to work then you should be opposed to roe v wade on that basis alone even if you think abortion is the greatest thing in the world if you claim to be a constitutionalist which Tommy does then you should definitely be opposed to roe v wade on constitutional grounds even if you don't oppose it on moral grounds or on any other ground it is not judicial activism much less is it religious judicial activism to overturn previous examples of judicial activism that's something the court should do roe v wade itself was judicial activism so the main legal argument against Roe is not that abortion is a terrible thing and it kills a person although that is a legal argument against it and I think a pretty good one but that's not them actually the primary legal argument the primary legal argument against Roe is that Rho itself was in incorrect legal decision the Supreme Court this is what happened in roe v wade the Supreme Court found in the Constitution a right to abortion even though abortion is never mentioned anywhere in the dot in the document there's no there's no mention of abortion in in the Constitution nor did any of the framers even hint that they had abortion anywhere in their minds when they wrote the document but of course the court recognized this obstacle because it had to and so it this is what it did it inferred a right to abortion from the right to privacy found in the 14th amendment the only problem of course is that the 14th amendment doesn't say anything about a right to privacy there is no right to privacy the phrase right to privacy doesn't appear anywhere in the bill of rights at all the phrase right to privacy is a phrase used by previous courts so they use the precedent of previous courts to infer it in Amendment where it didn't exist and where even if the right to privacy did exist in that amendment it still wouldn't have anything to do it all with abortion um so again the court founded its right to abortion which is not enumerated on another right which is not enumerated and which even if it were enumerated would have would not apply at all to abortion but the case is even more absurd than that because let's look at the Fourteenth Amendments section 1 of the 14th amendment which is where this right to abortion came from especially this part of it nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws so there's nothing in there about privacy there's nothing in there about abortion but again as just a rational person if you were to not you know not knowing anything about roe v wade or even anything about the constitution if you were to read that phrase and then someone were to ask you how does that apply to abortion what's the first thing you would say you would say well clearly this is a law against abortion because you can't deprive any person of light without due process of law and also equal protection under the law so abortion obviously deprives a human being of a life that's a biological fact you know if you have a living human organism which is now not living anymore because of abortion and there's no due process of law also these unborn humans are by definition not treated equally they have no perd forget about equal protection they have zero protection under the law so that's the only way a sane person could possibly apply that Clause to abortion but instead the court found found you can't deprive any person of life liberty property without due process of law as a as a as a codification of our right to kill people I mean what but you know this apparently some conservatives find that to be completely completely rational this is judicial activism judicial activism is when the court realizes that a particular thing is not in the Constitution so at issues a ruling pretending that that thing is in the Constitution because it the court believes that it should be in the Constitution that's what judicial activism is and that's what the Court did in roe v wade what without saying it directly although they almost said it directly they their point was well yeah of course the Constitution doesn't protect abortion but it should and so we're just going to say that it does here's the thing there is a process if we decide or if the government decides if elected representatives decide who allegedly are at the mercy of the people if they decide that on behalf of the people that a certain thing should be in the Constitution though it isn't or a certain thing which is in the Constitution should not be there is a process by which those things can be added in it's called amending and that is a legislative process it is not a judicial process the judiciary cannot look at the Constitution and say well that should be in there so let's so we'll just say that it is they can't do that that the the legislative branch can do that and so when the judicial branch acts like the legislative branch that is judicial activism so no matter how you feel about abortion it is clear that roe v wade is the number one prime example of judicial activism second thing putting putting road to the side okay so that's row of your way let's ask this question is it bad is there something wrong with a Christian fighting against abortion fighting for its prohibition legally because he the Christian feels called to do so by his faith I mean let's just you know according to Tommy and and other leftist we pro-lifers you know we're only fighting for this because we're Christian well let's just say that's true in the case of many for the case of many pro lifers so does that make us wrong does that make us incorrect and if it is if it does make us wrong if it is bad if it is theocratic if it is disqualifying well then guess what guess what we've also disqualified the abolition of slavery civil rights many other things after all many of the great human rights fights and victories in American history have been motivated on the part of many of the people fighting for them by Christian convictions so I ask you is that is the legitimacy of slavery abolition now suddenly called into question because most of the abolitionists were devout Christians and the only reason that they that they were abolitionists is because they is because of the fact of their of their religious faith what ket should we should we be should we be scolding the Reverend Martin Luther King jr. for pushing religion on the country because his conviction about civil rights and equal rights was clearly motivated by his Christian faith and what about all the people if you were to you know find a World War two veteran and ask him why did you go overseas and fight the Nazi scourge I I guarantee you that a great many of them would answer that at least part of the reason was their faith a Christian faith does that does that call into question what they did does that does that make world war two into a holy war all of a sudden is America a theocracy because it has civil rights just based on the fact that most of the people fighting for civil rights at the time were Christian or do we recognize that though their motivations in the case of the abolitionists of the case of the people fighting for civil rights and so on though their motivations may have been Christian their aim and the results of their fight were humanitarian and democratic here's a third thing this is the real point whatever whatever might be the personal motivations of a pro-life a person doesn't mean to be Christian to be pro-life and the government doesn't need to be a theocracy to outlaw the murder of the of unborn humans the claim that pro-lifers are making again putting aside their personal motivations and their personal beliefs because that is 100% irrelevant the claim that we make as pro-lifers we make basically two claims and neither of them have anything to do with Christian theology the first claim is a scientific claim we claim that humans in the womb are human because they can't be anything else they they must be it is a human in the womb is a living organism that is a biological fact J that no scientist in the world disputes none not a single one the human in the womb is a living organism period and discussion that is a scientific reality there is no way around it here's another reality if it's a living organism it must belong to a species heston all living organisms do here's another fact if it's a living organism conceived by two members of a certain species then that living organism must also be a member of that same species so two kangaroos cannot conceive a shark two sharks can not conceive an ostrich two human beings cannot conceive anything but a human being so we have a living organism who must be a human being that is our scientific claim and it is it's not even a claim it is a fact that we are just asserting here's the second claim that we make that and this is a I admit this is a moral claim so we have those scientific claim and now we have the moral claim that claim is that a human in the womb because he is human ought to be treated just like every other human and ought to have the same rights as every other human so we make the exact same moral claim that the abolitionists made about slavery and you could now you could disagree and you could say well no it's not the same thing but the fact is we are making the same moral claim it's not a Christian theological claim it is a it is a it is a a moral claim and it has to be moral because anytime you get into ought to okay so I'm saying that a human being ought to be treated as a human being any time you use the word ought to then you're talking about morality so if you have any ideas whatsoever about how a person ought to behave and how we ought to act as a society and what and how things ought to be then those are moral beliefs that you have they're not scientific beliefs they are moral beliefs and in that way every law our whole legal system is based on a moral framework because the law by definition tells people what they should do and should not do and it even punishes them for doing things they shouldn't do that is a moral process does that mean that the law itself is inherently Christian does that mean that there were no laws before Christianity came along I mean honestly I'm flattered that the way left is talk about Christianity they basically give us credit for I got I don't know we Christian Christians we invented law we invented human decency dignity we invented morality I mean all these are all ours and honestly I'd love to take credit for all that but no that's these are these are these are broader and and and things that pre-existed Christian theology now it is true that the pro-life position while not specifically Christian is grounded inevitably in a belief in a creator god that is true so I admit that but if that's what you mean by pushing religion then fine but then the entire doctrine of human rights is also theocratic and should be abolished and what is the doctrine of human rights in a doctrine of human rights is in fact a doctrine it is a dogma it is not it is not a scientific observation human rights are not things that can be observed within the person if you look within a person you're not going to find oh yeah there's their right to free speech right there no again human rights those are those are that is a spiritual doctrine and what is the doctrine well Thomas Jefferson helpfully outlined it for us we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a human right cannot be onion about it cannot be inherent it cannot be self-evident unless it is a part of our very nature as humans and endowed by a force above us above humanity a creative force that's what that is the founding document of the United States of America and that is what it says right at the top that we are founding this country upon this spiritual doctrine of human rights that are endowed by a Creator God that is literally the foundation of the United States of America and it has to be that way because if rights are simply assigned by the government or decided by the whims of the mob or voted on by the people then rights are not unalienable they are not self-evident they are not inherent they are not endowed supernaturally and therefore the very foundations of our country are void and the Bill of Rights itself should be discarded but then here's the problem so if we get rid of human rights we get rid of the Bill of Rights then the basis for the rights to book to abortion has also been discarded you can't disqualify the argument against abortion without disqualifying the argument for it that's the that's the problem that you have if you're pro-abortion roe v wade and pro-abortion people they claim that there is a right to abortion and I assume that they believe that it is an unalienable right in fact I know they believe in that because they would say that if it's not unalienable if it's a right that's just decided by the people well then you couldn't complain when the people decide to take the right away but no you're saying it's an unalienable right and if it's unalienable then it's part of our human nature and if it's part of our human nature than it was endowed by God so what you're saying is that God has given you the right to kill your children you that is a spiritual argument that you are making and it is a demented insane spiritual art you so the pro-life the pro-life case is not Christian but it is spiritual and the pro-abortion case is spiritual too and if you have a problem with all of that and you don't like to admit that these are spiritual arguments then at least have the intellectual integrity to admit that you have a problem with human rights themselves which are also spiritual in that they cannot be observed they cannot be a product of evolution and if they are real at all they must be inherent and therefore objective so forth thing or maybe I'm on the third thing I can like it kind of carried away last point I'll just put it that way whoo so as we've established the pro-life case is a scientific case it's also a spiritual case admittedly but it is a spiritual case it in the same vein on the in the same way that human rights themselves are a spiritual case but who was really making the religious case this specifically religious like you'd have to be a part of this religion to believe it the pro-life case is grounded in biological science and universal moral law Universal because all people everywhere agree that murder is wrong that is a universal this is a also one of the most compelling proofs for the existence of God that there that there exist this universal morality that everywhere in the world everyone everywhere in the world throughout history has agreed with you take even civilizations that never encountered each other before and they came to the same kind of conclusion now it's also true that most civilizations many including ours have tried to make exceptions to this idea that it's wrong to murder or they have come up with forms of murder that they claim are not murder but they all still agree in the end that murder is wrong what they try to do is parse it and kind of compartmentalize and so as to still allow the murder of certain kinds of people that's what the pro-life cases grounded the pro-abortion case on the other hand is grounded in not science at all there's no science to it it's pure dogma and it's grounded in some kind of moral law that is confused and incomprehensible and just completely utterly baseless the pro-abortion person believes to think believes number one that the biological status of a human person in the womb hinges on the the desires and feelings of its mother this is what pro-abortion people say this is not I'm not this not a straw man if you were to ask them when does life begin what they'll tell you is well tip it's it's up to the mother so if the mother refers to her baby as a baby then it's a baby if the mother wants the baby then it's a person it's living if the mother doesn't want the person calls it a fetus then it's a fetus and it's not a person that's what pro-abortion people believe that's what they'll tell you there is no science whatsoever to back that up the idea that the the biological status of a person can be dependent upon the preferences of another person I mean that's just the superstition is that is the definition of anti science so they have an anti scientific view and their moral view is not universal at all it's it's very particular to their belief system it is that's why I call it religious or cultish if you want you know pro-lifers say you shouldn't murder okay everyone agrees and we might disagree about how you apply it so on but we all agree don't murk what pro-abortion people say though is is is is is different they believe that it can be morally acceptable to kill a defenseless and innocent human organism but only on three conditions the first condition is that this life is inconvenient the second is that the life is not yet born and in the third condition is the most absurd the third condition is that this that the person killing the life or having the life killed is the parent of the life so the person being killed must be the biological child of the person who is killing them so traditional morality would find that all murder is horrible but no form of murder is more horrible than the murder of a child by a parent that's traditional morality most people in the world would say that's the worst kind of Murli it's all bad that's the absolute worst kind that's the most set of Pama nation but the pro-abortion version of morality will say that all forms of murder are wrong except for the murder of your own child again I can only call that a religious belief it's not scientific it's not Universal it's not self-evident it's not grounded in any kind of natural moral law it's just that it is a it is a doctrinal view that is shared only by leftist it's a part of their religion you so that's what we find while pro lifers are making a scientific case and a moral case it is actually the pro-abortion people who are making a specifically religious cultish case they are the ones we're trying to establish ate their own kind of theocracy they want laws that govern according to their own specific particular moral views so that's why they don't want us to push our religion on them it's because they're trying to push their religion on us and they don't like all the competition I guess alright that's it for me thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
