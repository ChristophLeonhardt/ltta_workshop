1
00:00:05,954 --> 00:00:06,854
>> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT

2
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:07,721
MASSIVE GROUP OF PEOPLE ON

3
00:00:07,722 --> 00:00:09,056
THE BRIDGE, WHEN YOU SAW IT

4
00:00:09,057 --> 00:00:10,691
ON THE BRIDGE, THE GROUP, I

5
00:00:10,692 --> 00:00:11,925
REALLY THINK THAT IT

6
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:14,361
PROBABLY SPELLS OUT TO US

7
00:00:14,362 --> 00:00:15,329
AND CONGRESS SOMETHING HAS

8
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,263
TO BE DONE.

9
00:00:16,264 --> 00:00:17,297
WE'LL HAVE TO CALL UP OUR

10
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:18,198
MILITARY, IF WE NEED.

11
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:19,767
TO SAY BUT WE CAN'T LET THIS

12
00:00:19,768 --> 00:00:20,100
HAPPEN.

13
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:22,169
WE CANNOT ALLOW OUR COUNTRY

14
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,139
TO BE VIOLATED LIKE THIS.

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,773
STEVE: THERE YOU HAVE GOT

16
00:00:25,774 --> 00:00:26,473
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

17
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:27,241
STATES YESTERDAY IN THE OVAL

18
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:29,276
OFFICE TALKING ABOUT THE

19
00:00:29,277 --> 00:00:29,643
CARAVAN.

20
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:30,344
KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR

21
00:00:30,345 --> 00:00:30,944
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE

22
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:31,812
UNITED STATES, SHE JOINS US

23
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:34,048
FROM THE NORTH LAWN.

24
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:34,748
KELLYANNE, SO MUCH HAS BEEN

25
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:37,418
MADE OF THIS CARAVAN OF

26
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:37,851
ABOUT 7,000.

27
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:38,986
NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS

28
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:40,854
A SECOND ONE THAT IS PARKED

29
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:41,288
IN GUATEMALA.

30
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,157
AND I THINK THERE IS 2500

31
00:00:43,158 --> 00:00:43,457
THERE.

32
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:44,558
WHAT IS GOING ON?

33
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:46,226
>> WELL THE CARAVAN IS A

34
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:47,728
SYMBOL OF BROKEN PROMISES

35
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:49,897
AND FAILED POLICIES BY THE

36
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:50,497
DEMOCRATS.

37
00:00:50,498 --> 00:00:51,165
EVERY SINGLE DEMOCRATIC

38
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,767
SENATOR HAS SIGNED ONTO THE

39
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:55,803
FEINSTEIN IDEA FOR OPEN

40
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:56,136
BORDERS.

41
00:00:56,137 --> 00:00:58,072
AND AS HAVE YOU PRESIDENT

42
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:00,140
OBAMA FECKLESSLY AND

43
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:00,841
RECKLESSLY TRYING TO TAKE

44
00:01:00,842 --> 00:01:02,776
CREDIT FOR THE TRUMP

45
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:03,110
ECONOMY.

46
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,211
HE OUGHT TO TAKE CREDIT OR

47
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,546
BLAME FOR WHAT WE ARE SEEING

48
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:06,714
AT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER.

49
00:01:06,715 --> 00:01:08,515
THEY DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

50
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:11,652
TO CURB THE INFLUX OF

51
00:01:11,653 --> 00:01:12,286
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING

52
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:13,187
OVER THIS BORDER.

53
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:15,456
LOOK, I'M, YOU KNOW, EQUAL

54
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:16,757
PARTS COMPASSION AND

55
00:01:16,758 --> 00:01:17,124
TITANIUM.

56
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:18,792
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I FEAR

57
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:21,495
THAT MANY OF THE HONDURAN

58
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,696
NATIONALS WERE PROMISED

59
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:25,499
THINGS THAT WON'T BE

60
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,101
DELIVERED, GIVEN, I THINK,

61
00:01:27,102 --> 00:01:28,001
PROMISES THAT CAN'T BE

62
00:01:28,002 --> 00:01:30,003
FULFILLED BOY THE COYOTES

63
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:31,939
CHARGING THEM SO MUCH MONEY

64
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,073
OR OTHER FOLKS NOT TELLING

65
00:01:33,074 --> 00:01:34,875
THEM WHAT A TREACHEROUS

66
00:01:34,876 --> 00:01:36,043
JOURNEY THIS COULD BE.

67
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:37,878
YOU SEE THE NEWS STATISTICS

68
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:39,179
SHOW THAT OVER HALF A

69
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,080
MILLION PEOPLE TRY TO CROSS

70
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:41,648
THE BORDER ILLEGALLY LAST

71
00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:41,949
YEAR.

72
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,751
AND WE HAVE THIS INCREASE IN

73
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:44,918
FAMILIES TRYING TO CROSS

74
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:45,219
OVER.

75
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,386
BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW

76
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:47,521
THAT THEY ARE FAMILY UNITS.

77
00:01:47,522 --> 00:01:50,691
YOU CAN HAVE ONE MALE

78
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:54,328
GRABBING SOMEONE ELSE'S KID

79
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,129
AND PRETEND GO AHEAD THEY

80
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,430
ARE A FAMILY UNIT.

81
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:57,698
I'M VERY CONCERNED EVEN ONE

82
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,233
OF THOSE HAPPENS.

83
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:02,569
YOU KNOW WELL IT'S

84
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,137
HAPPENING.

85
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:05,105
THE CHILD SMUGGLING AND DRUG

86
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:05,472
SMUGGLING.

87
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:06,740
WE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHO

88
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:08,342
IS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY.

89
00:02:08,342 --> 00:02:08,941
DEMOCRATS DON'T ACT.

90
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:12,746
THEY WENT FOR ALL THE FOPS

91
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:14,548
DOWN AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER

92
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,750
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

93
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:17,818
THEY ARE COMPLETELY RADIO

94
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:18,385
SILENT ON THIS.

95
00:02:18,386 --> 00:02:19,286
SECRETARY POMPEO IS

96
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:19,853
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

97
00:02:19,854 --> 00:02:22,289
WE ARE THE WORLD'S MOST

98
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,290
GENEROUS NATION.

99
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:24,358
33 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE

100
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,626
IMMIGRATED HERE LEGALLY.

101
00:02:25,627 --> 00:02:27,094
MANY WE ALL KNOW AND PEOPLE

102
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:29,663
SHOULD TRY TO DO THAT

103
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:30,063
LEGALLY.

104
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:30,631
BRIAN: SENATOR SCHUMER

FROM COMING IN HERE.

108
00:02:35,503 --> 00:02:36,537

109
00:02:36,538 --> 00:02:39,072
ABOUT THE IDIOCY OF CHAIN

00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:40,507
MIGRATION HOW RIDICULOUS IT

111
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:40,774
IS.

112
00:02:40,775 --> 00:02:43,143
BARACK OBAMA IN 2005 TALKED

113
00:02:43,144 --> 00:02:45,245
ABOUT YOU CAN'T JUST WALK

114
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:49,783
INTO OUR COUNTRY

115
00:02:49,784 --> 00:02:50,450
UNINCUMBERED BECAUSE IT'S

116
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:52,186
NOT FAIR TO PEOPLE HERE.

117
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:53,787
WHAT HAPPENED?

118
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:56,156
DID PEOPLE NOT KNOW VCRS

119
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:57,424
WERE ROLLING THAT WE KNEW

120
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:58,325
WHERE THEY STOOD?

121
00:02:58,326 --> 00:02:58,759
WHAT CHANGED?

122
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,660

123
00:02:59,661 --> 00:03:00,661
DO YOU KNOW WHAT CHANGED?

124
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:03,330
DONALD TRUMP GOT ELECTED AND

125
00:03:03,331 --> 00:03:04,331
GOT ELECTED OVERWHELMINGLY

126
00:03:04,332 --> 00:03:05,699
IN SOME STATES BECAUSE OF

127
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,667
ISSUES LIKE THIS.

128
00:03:06,668 --> 00:03:08,635
HE IS SAYING THAT WE'RE A

129
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:09,303
SOVEREIGN NATION.

130
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:10,571
WE NEED PHYSICAL BORDERS.

131
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:12,739
AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHO IS

132
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,040
HERE.

133
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:15,442
YOU CAN IMGRATE LEGALLY.

134
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:16,410
AND, ALSO, THIS PRESIDENT

135
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:17,711
HAS BEEN VERY FORTH RIGHT

136
00:03:17,712 --> 00:03:19,413
FOR OVER THREE YEARS NOW

137
00:03:19,414 --> 00:03:20,380

154
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:44,905

160
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:50,544
THIS IS A FAILURE OF THE

162
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:53,380

THE DEMOCRATS NEVER THOUGHT

00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:35,923
WORK WITH MEXICO.

195
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:37,324
REQUIRE THE MIGRANTS TO STOP

196
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:39,660
IN MEXICO AND SEEK ASYLUM

197
00:04:39,661 --> 00:04:41,061
THERE AND MEXICO WOULD HAVE

198
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:42,229
TO AGREE TO DO THAT?

199
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,096
WILL IT WORK.

200
00:04:43,097 --> 00:04:45,899
>> MEXICO HAS BEEN VERY

201
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,900
COOPERATIVE HERE AND I WANT

202
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:48,035
TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.

203
00:04:48,036 --> 00:04:50,404
THEY HAVE OFFERED TO I HAVE

204
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:52,739
THINK GRANT TEMPORARY VISAS

205
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,674
OR ASYLUM THERE AS I

206
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,509
UNDERSTANDING IT, MANY IN

207
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,412
THE CARAVAN ARE PUSHING

208
00:04:58,413 --> 00:04:59,846
FORWARD AND REFUSING THAT

209
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:00,614
THE MAJORITY OF THEM IT'S

210
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:01,748
ESTIMATE YOU HAD ARE

211
00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:02,616
ECONOMIC MIGRANTS.

212
00:05:02,617 --> 00:05:05,986
NOT THOSE THAT HAVE A OF

213
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:06,320
ASYLUM.

214
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:07,654
THAT'S VERY INSTRUCTIVE TOO

215
00:05:07,655 --> 00:05:08,522
TO MY OTHER POINT.

216
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:09,556
WE HAVE TO TRY WHAT'S BEEN

217
00:05:09,557 --> 00:05:10,590
TRIED IN THE PAST.

218
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:11,692
AT LEAST YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN

219
00:05:11,693 --> 00:05:12,926
SENATORS LIKE THE TWO YOU

220
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,027
JUST MENTIONED TRYING TO

221
00:05:14,028 --> 00:05:15,295
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

222
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:16,296
YOU HAVE GOT DEMOCRATS OUT

223
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:17,798
THERE RUNNING FOR 2020.

224
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,267
THEY HAVE DONE ABSOLUTELY

225
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:21,068
NOTHING IN 2018 TO SECURE

226
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:21,802
OUR BORDERS.

227
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:23,303
TO KEEP US DRUG-FREE AND

228
00:05:23,304 --> 00:05:23,603
SAFE.

229
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:24,805
THEY ALL VOTED AGAINST TAX

230
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:26,940
CUTS THAT ARE STEM A LITTLE

231
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,909
OUR

232
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:28,942

233
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:30,877
STIMULATINGOUR ECONOMY.

234
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:31,778
BLUE COLLAR WAGES ARE UP.

235
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:33,080
WAGES FOR EVERYBODY ARE UP.

236
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,247
UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN.

237
00:05:34,248 --> 00:05:35,515
OPTIMISM IS SURGING.

238
00:05:35,516 --> 00:05:37,084
THE STOCK MARKET, THE

239
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:38,752
FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL

240
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:39,853
STRONG UNDER THE TRUMP

241
00:05:39,854 --> 00:05:40,187
ECONOMY.

242
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:41,621
DID YOU SEE KAMALA HARRIS

243
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:41,989
YESTERDAY?

244
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,523
SHE WAS AT SOME COLLEGE IN

245
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:45,492
IOWA FOR AN EVENT AND ABOUT

246
00:05:45,493 --> 00:05:46,960
12 PEOPLE WERE IN THE

247
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:47,494
PICTURE?

248
00:05:47,495 --> 00:05:47,828
12?

249
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:49,529
IT'S LIKE CAN I INVITE YOU

250
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,664
OVER FOR DINNER TONIGHT AND

251
00:05:50,665 --> 00:05:51,264
HAVE MORE PEOPLE.

252
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,132
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

253
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,000
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO

254
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:54,434
SELL THINGS THAT NOBODY IS

255
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:54,868
BUYING.

256
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,670
WHY ISN'T SHE AT THE BORDER

257
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:59,006
SAYING, FOLKS, LET'S COME IN

258
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,407
LEGALLY.

259
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:02,009
I AGREE WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA

260
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:02,642
FROM 2005.

261
00:06:02,643 --> 00:06:04,478
I THINK EVERY CANDIDATE

262
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,712
SHOULD BE ASKED DO YOU AGREE

263
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,147
OR DISAGREE WITH PRESIDENT

264
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,048
OBAMA FROM 2005.

265
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:09,349
HE IS OUT THERE TRYING TO

266
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,951
TAKE CREDIT FOR A TRUMP

267
00:06:10,952 --> 00:06:11,284
ECONOMY.

268
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,719
YOU KNOW WHAT?

269
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,187
TO QUOTE OBAMA FROM 2004.

270
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:14,755
HE DIDN'T BUILD.

271
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:16,256
THIS HE DIDN'T BUILD THAT

272
00:06:16,257 --> 00:06:16,590
ECONOMY.

273
00:06:16,591 --> 00:06:17,257
PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AND

274
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:20,327
EVERYBODY KNOWS IT.

275
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:21,061
STEVE: DEMOCRAT WOULD RATHER

276
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:21,795
TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE

277
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,130
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S A

278
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:24,197
WINNER FOR THEM AND NOT

279
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:24,598
IMMIGRATION.

280
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:26,133
>> THEY ARE WRONG THERE,

281
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:26,466
TOO.

282
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:27,567
20 MILLION AMERICANS, IT'S

283
00:06:27,568 --> 00:06:28,301
ESTIMATED, STILL DON'T HAVE

284
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:30,137
ANY TYPE OF HEALTH INSURANCE

285
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:31,538
8 AND A HALF YEARS AFTER

286
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:31,905
OBAMACARE.

287
00:06:31,906 --> 00:06:33,173
IT WAS A DISALSER FOR MANY

288
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:33,540
AMERICANS.

289
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:35,842
THIS PRESIDENT HAS PUT FORTH

290
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:37,310

291
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,845
SHORT-TERM DURATION PLANS.

292
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:39,713
DRUFING PRIVACIES ARE GOING

293
00:06:39,714 --> 00:06:40,080
DOWN.

294
00:06:40,081 --> 00:06:42,049
TODAY HE IS SIGNING HISTORIC

STEVE: THAT'S WHAT I WANTED

298
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,420
TO ASK YOU ABOUT.

299
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,288

HAPPENING.

304
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:53,260
