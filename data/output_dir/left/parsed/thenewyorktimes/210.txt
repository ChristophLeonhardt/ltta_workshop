“Swamp captain Mitch McConnell
has created millions of jobs
for China people. While doing so,
Mitch has gotten rich.”
This is Don Blankenship.
He’s the Trump-like
Republican candidate
running for Senate
in West Virginia
who even Donald Trump 
can’t get behind.
“So in a single vote,
we can vote for Trump’s policies 
and against the swamp.”
“Both Dons know a thing
or two about creating jobs.”
Blankenship’s “America
First”-style campaign
hasn’t minced words.
“D.C. swamp captain
Mitch McConnell
said he will drop
President Trump like a rock.
Now he backs false
and negative ads
against Trump supporter
Don Blankenship.”
“In fact his China
family has given him
tens of millions of dollars.
The war to drain the swamp
and create jobs for West
Virginia people has begun.”
He has spent a
considerable amount
of airtime targeting the family
of Transportation Secretary
Elaine Chao, 
Mitch McConnell’s wife,
who is Chinese-American.
He’s a former coal executive
who served a year in prison
for his role in a
mining explosion
that killed 29 people in 2010,
a charge he portrays 
as a political conspiracy.
“Did you know Don
Blankenship’s trial
was not about the
mine explosion?”
“Really? You sure?”
“Oh, yeah.
The Obama judge wouldn’t even
let Don mention the explosion
and the Obama prosecutors
knew Don had nothing
to do with the explosion.”
He’s gained support
in coal country
and that’s making Republicans
in Washington nervous.
A G.O.P.-linked super PAC has even
funded a series of ads against him.
Blankenship has survived
other hiccups as well.
It has been reported that he
actually resides in Las Vegas,
not West Virginia, and is
the only candidate
who hasn’t disclosed his finances.
Voters go to the
ballot box on May 8.
“I will beat Joe Manchin
and ditch 'cocaine Mitch'
for the sake of the kids.”
