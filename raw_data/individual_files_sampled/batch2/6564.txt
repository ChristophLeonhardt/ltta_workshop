now when Donald Trump got elected I was skeptical about his views of the TPP during the campaign he said over and over again that he was against the trans-pacific partnership it was a global trade deal so in fact you're gonna watch a video here the day after the election when Donald Trump was won and here was a prediction that I made now Trump folks really you think he's gonna be against TPP no here's what he's gonna do he's gonna do the same exact thing Hillary Clinton would done oh no I'm a guest that we're gonna negotiate a better deal okay guys hey Rizzo all worked out to corporations I've decided to give me money for my next run okay all the deals much better Oh see I knew go she ate a better deal let's sign it right away right away giveaway American sovereignty who cares my sucker voters aren't gonna pay attention anyway I hope I'm wrong about it but I doubt it he will never deliver on that deal he's more likely to deliver on the wall than he has to withdraw from TPP no he'll claim he made it better and then immediately Simon okay let's break down the different ways that was right Democrats right now are considering helping Donald Trump fund his wall which is somewhat likely unfortunately right now on the other hand with TPP you could argue well Genki you didn't get out of TPP until the Republican donors were very happy with the tax bill they're giving money at the Donald Trump at a record rate Steve Wynn now the disgraced Steve Wynn held a fundraiser for Donald Trump in the middle of the budget showdown you had to pay $100,000 to get a seat at that table so those are the donors going great job on the trillions of tax costs tax cuts that you gave to the very very rich so lo and behold Donald Trump goes to Davos to meet the global financial elite which he claimed he was against and then we have a report out of the hill President Trump said Thursday he would consider re-entering the trans-pacific partnership trade agreement if the terms were more favorable to the US and then as if he were channeling my prediction adding I would do TPP if we world to able to make a substantially better deal almost exactly as predicted Oh TPP it's fine now I made it a better deal yeah yeah that's why I'm reentering make checks payable to Donald Trump's next presidential run into the Republican Party now that he's part of the global financial elite by the way they had disdain for him because he'd gotten bankrupt six times he's a natural-born loser never could run a business he got money from certain places well we know both Eric Trump and Donald Trump jr. have said that the Russians gave them a ton of money but he was still an outcast but now that he gets to attend avos and had people like Seawind throw fundraisers for him he's ecstatic yeah of course TPP for everyone my voters they're a bunch of idiots it is that I scammed like the guys I scammed at Trump University send the money send the money no the hill says it's a surprising stance for Trump who won the 2016 election on a promise to take a more protectionist stance on trade well not surprising to some finally again the hill reports Trump railed against the TPP as a candidate announced the US would pull out of the agreement one of his first acts as president at the time Trump said leaving the TPP is quote a great thing for the American worker but now that he's got all the corporate cash in his coffers all the sudden Donald Trump thinks no no no re-entering TPP would now be a great thing for the American worker it almost seems like he changes opinion depending on who's paying him hmm I think I get to say told you if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm /join and once you do you'll be saying you know I'm like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me DUI tea network.com slash joy
