>> THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.
>> THE WHITE HOUSE CELEBRATING
PASTOR BRUNSON'S RELEASE, THE
EFFORTS SAY TONIGHT THAT THEY
ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE
OTHER AMERICANS STILL DETAINED
IN TURKEY.
AS WELL AS POTENTIAL CRISIS
BREWING RIGHT NOW WITH SAUDI
ARABIA.
HERE WITH MORE IS THE ILLINOIS
CONGRESSMAN KINSINGER, THE
REPUBLICAN AND MEMBER OF THE
HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS
COMMITTEE.
WELCOME.
>> THANKS.
>> WE'LL GET TO SAUDI ARABIA
IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST TALK
ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
PRESIDENT GETTING PASTOR
BRUNSON OUT WITHOUT PAYING
RANSOM.
A FEW MONTHS AGO I WAS ON DUTY
WHEN HE WAS WITH HOLT RELEASED
FROM A PRISON AND THAT IS
WITHOUT THE U.S. PAYING MONEY.
TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE.
>> THIS IS AMAZING.
IF YOU THINK OF THE PRIOR
ADMINISTRATION WHAT WAS PAID
TO GET PEOPLE BACK.
DOING THIS, THE PRESIDENT
TRUMP UNDERSTANDS ONE THING
ABOUT THE U.S. POWER.
THAT THERE IS U.S. POWER.
THAT WE ARE THE LARGEST
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.
THE BIGGEST MILITARY.
WE HAVE ARROWS IN THE QUIBER
TO USE.
SO TO TAKE A TOUGH STAND, A
LOT OF PEOPLE WERE UPSET AND
SAYING HE WILL SANCTION TURKEY
UNTIL THEY RELEASE OUR
CITIZEN.
HE WILL GET A TON OF CREDIT
FOR THIS AND CELEBRATED
TOMORROW.
>> WE TRIED TO DO RESEARCH
TODAY.
THIS IS MURKY HOW MANY
AMERICANS ARE DETAINED IN A
PLACE LIKE TURKEY.
AMERICANS ARE DETAINED ALL
AROUND THE WORLD AND WE PRAY
FOR THEM EVERY DAY.
WE SHOULD.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW
MANY AMERICANS ARE STILL IN
TURKEY BEYOND PASTOR BRUNSON?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER BUT
SOME ARE A LOT.
SOME OF THEM CAN BE FOR
LEGITIMATE REASONS BUT SOME
ARE ILLEGITIMATE REASON.
THE PASTOR WAS ILLEGITIMATE
REASON.
IT WAS A PREPOSTEROUS TRIAL.
BUT THE PRESIDENT MAKES IT
CLEAR THERE IS A COST TO
ILLEGALLY DETAINING THE
AMERICAN CITIZENS.
IT HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT.
NOT JUST TURKEY BUT OTHER
COUNTRIES LOOK AT THIS SAYING
DO WE GET LEVERAGE DETAIN AN
AMERICAN ILLEGALLY OR DOES IT
COST US MORE?
>> I WANT TO GO TO SAUDI
ARABIA.
YOU MENTIONED THE AMERICAN
POWER.
THE PRESIDENT IS UNDER
PRESSURE TONIGHT.
HE WILL GET CONGRATULATIONS
FOR BRINGING PASTOR BRUNSON
HOME BUT HE IS UNDER PRESSURE
TO DO MORE TO DEAL WITH SAUDI
ARABIA AND FIND OUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI,
THE JOURNALIST WHO DISAPPEARED
AND SOME FEAR HE HAS BEEN
MURDERED.
THE TURKS SAY SAUDI ARABIA
PLANNED THIS OUT AND KILLED
HIM.
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
>> EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE THAT
IS CORRECT.
TURKEY HAS BEEN
FORWARD-LEANING.
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE HAD
EVIDENCE.
THEY PLAYED THE EVIDENCE.
I HAVEN'T HEARD IT.
IT'S DISGUSTING IF IT'S TRUE.
AND IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE.
BUT I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT
HERE IS TO TAKE THE BROAD
INTERNATIONAL POLL TUCKS OF
THIS AND PUT IT IN CONTEXT.
KEEP IN MIND, RUSSIANS
POISONED PEOPLE IN THE UNITED
KINGDOM.
ASAD, IRAN AND RUSSIA KILLED
500,000 SYRIANS.
SO THIS IS NOT EXCUSING.
THERE NEEDS TO BE A COST TO
THAT.
BUT SOME OF THE SENATORS THAT
HAVE BEEN PINING FOR YEARS TO
CUT OFF ANY AID TO SAUDI
ARABIA FOR SOME REASON ARE
USING THIS AS THE IMPETUS TO
SAY THIS IS THE REASON TO NOW
BASICALLY CUT OFF ALL AID, CUT
OFF RELATIONSHIPS WITH SAUDI
ARABIA IS AN OVERREACTION.
>> 30 SECONDS.
ONE SENATOR IS LINDSEY GRAHAM.
HE SAID THERE SHOULD BE A
BIPARTISAN TSUNAMI HE CALLS IT
IF IN FACT SAUDI WAS BEHIND
THE DISAPPEARANCE AND
POTENTIAL MURDER.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
YOU SAY DON'T CUT OFF AID.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ARMS SALES?
OVER $100 BILLION IN ARMY
SALES?
>> THE ARM SALES IS A BIG
THING TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE WE
HANDLE THERE.
THERE ARE BIG IMPLICATIONS.
I HAVE RESPECT FOR LINDSEY
GRAHAM.
THERE SHOULD BE SANCTIONS BUT
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BEFORE
WE MAKE MASSIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS
AND END THE RELATIONSHIP WITH
SAUDI ARABIA.
I WOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS
EVERYWHERE ELSE.
>> GET THE FACTS BEFORE TAKING
ACTION.
