what do you think is Putin's ultimate
fault you know his ultimate goal is to
dominate his neighborhood again to
dominate what used to be Eastern Europe
behind the so-called Iron Curtain to
dominate Central Asia to have a foothold
in the Middle East which is a large part
of what his support of Assad in Syria is
intended to do to break up NATO to break
up the EU to sow as much dissension and
instability inside democracies it's not
just American elections or American
politicians that he has gone after he's
done the same thing in Europe and so he
wants to undo the architecture of the
post-world War two world
