well it's curious sometimes we need to rely on foreign media to give the kind of reportage on Canadian politics that our own domestic media party will not give us and so it was this week when the New York Post wrote the clearest criticism of our NAFTA strategy of any media the headline is Justin Trudeau finally gets the trade trouble he deserves it's an interesting article about how Canada frittered away our pole position on NAFTA to our own economic risk it's written by a professor of law at George Mason University Scalia School of Law his name is Professor Frank Buckley and to my shock professor Buckley was actually invited on the CBC Canada state broadcaster to explain himself may I show you a short clip a professor Buckley talking to reshmi Nair of the CBC take a look at this take a look what we talked about NAFTA we want to ask you about this op-ed piece in The New York Times because there's a lot of talk about it and about the president's ability to make decisions what is your reaction to that piece well George Mason on American universities but my article was wasn't heaven's name or the Canadians thinking in all of this I mean they decided that really what was important here was things like gender equity and not the the auto trade and they sent down Chrystia Freeland to negotiate and she went out of her way to convey her contempt for Trump and that just struck me and says about the stupidest thing you can do unless of course you would be just as happy to see the whole thing fail convey her sorry can't give that to me in what example do you have of the Minister expressing your views on Donald Trump well if you took all the speech she gave summer at the Foreign Policy magazine data fest it basically echoed everything that one reads in The Washington Post about about Donald Trump and the White House took it personally though I thought it said right you know we know where she's coming from she didn't mention my name but nevertheless and thereafter she was completely frozen out of the White House so she gets to come down and talk to the Trade Representative here but but thoughts and she talks to congressmen but that's basically about it so you know frankly if you really if you really wanted to deal it's too late now the best thing one could have done would have been to send somebody else to negotiate for Canada I love that clip reshmi near I don't I don't think she was hostile to professor Buckley I think she was just stunned she had never heard anyone criticized Chrystia Freeland before she had the wondrous look of a child seeing something for the first time and I'm delighted to say joining us now via Skype from George Mason University is Professor Frank Buckley and by the way professor I want to mention you've got a book coming out it's called the Republican Workers Party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed I can hardly wait to dig into that thanks for coming up the rebel how did you think your CBC interview went I thought it was fascinating I thought it was pretty good actually they were you know I thought they were fairly polite I think you're right she was just stunned I mean look the CBC does have a bit of a problem about the Trudeau cabinet and Christiane Freeland and you know my analysis is they've lost the gag reflex I mean that which would most people find really revoltingly smarmy and they think oh this is just so peachy keen yeah you know I I saw Reshma nares reaction and she was criticized on Twitter I don't think she was mad or fighting at least in the clip we showed there I think she was what Christian Freeland isn't the bee's knees she's not this dreamy gender equity I mean it I think she was like you had told her the tooth fairy's not real she just couldn't process what you were saying I think it's that she the Canadian political media industrial complex is such a closed system they'd never heard your point of view before well perhaps that's true I mean there are some good people in Canada like you and we're and Rex Murphy but for the most part it's pretty dismal and and you know the thing is this is serious this is really up there it's about the most important thing that the Canadian government could do is we negotiate NAFTA and they've gone out of their way to show that their bloody idiots on the question where I think they took their time they boasted about their great contacts in Congress which you know ruts ruckettes not going to do much they were frozen out of the White House and Freeland went out of her way to convey her disgust and with with the president I mean I mean you couldn't maybe you couldn't they're there two explanations one is this is really really stupid the other explanation is they wanted to fail yeah I'm tending more and more towards the latter because I mean we we went through in detail that speech who referred to at Foreign Policy magazine where Freeland was named the diplomat of the year how that could have past anyone's test after the India Fiasco the Saudi fiasco yeah I think like the Nobel Peace Prize she was just being awarded it for her political point of view remember that foreign policy magazine ran an article saying Trump is Hitler yeah now a professor what but the one thing that did surprise me is that they had you on at all because of course you're a former speechwriter for Donald Trump and you were part of his transition team but our producer dug up a clip of you on the CBC last year when you were in studio in Toronto with a different journalist at our state broadcaster rosemary Barton and it wasn't quite as friendly but I'd like to play that clip for our viewers it's it's a little bit shorter take a look here's a blast from your past professor Buckley Oh a social liberalism that allows people to be given things and a government that is trying to it's just astounding the United States has a welfare system more generous than Canada finally don't believe his truth America has 72 different federal welfare schemes and as a host your state ones in terms of will third per treaty P is I think the second most generous country in the world okay I live in Canada was about 25 years ago right so though forgive me if I know more about the country than you thank you for your time appreciate it thank you oh this never forget professor when you you don't even live here I'll forgive me if I mean that that's the sneering yeah I know well the idea that somebody working for the CBC in Ottawa knows much about Canada is pretty ridiculous in itself but you know look I you know I am Canadian not only that but I've written several books favorably comparing Canada at the United States I've said that you know Canada for example is in many respects more right-wing then in the United States I mean take a look at what Trump wanted Trump wanted a Canadian style immigration system Trump wanted a Canadian style system as to corporate taxation he wanted a rat relaxation of the regulatory state which would bring America closer to Canada so you know it's as if Canada is able to pay for its wool politically correct foreign policy by the fact that it's really pretty conservative at home well that's an interesting point of view you know professor let me run a thesis by you Canada's media I call the media party I think it's it's worse than America because we're a smaller pawn and so it's more stale and our state broadcaster is larger than all other private news media combined so not only is it dominant but as the private news media continues to shrink and lay off people journalists say well my only hope is to get on with the CBC I better tailor my opinions now so that I'm a I'm a real prospect to be hired there later here's here's what I think happens because the media is such a closed circuit I mean rushman the air could not believe that you thought Chrystia Freeland wasn't amazing so either they're ideologically supportive of Trudeau and Freeland or they're just biting their tongues because they don't want to put themselves offside with the state and the fact that Trudeau and Freeland have not had the kind of harsh scrutiny let's say Donald Trump had or our former Prime Minister Stephen Harper had there's no corrective so there was no corrective after the India Fiasco no corrective after the Saudi fiasco no corrective when Chrystia Freeland flubs it because everyone says oh you're wonderful you're wonderful and so the first time they actually encountered something tough they fail and they're failing in NAFTA and they don't understand why they they actually think no no they're like Baghdad Bob saddam hussein's spin-doctor saying no no this is going wonderfully I think the media have some blame here because they kept telling Justin Trudeau he was fabulous right I mean and in fact he's the world's laughingstock at this point right I mean after Bollywood and indeed after the the Saudi fiasco right where the the American State Department said you know we're not going to take sides on this one and nobody else in the world rushed to the side of Canada and then you have Canada condescending to Mexico and the Mexicans saying thank you very much but you know we don't need you though so much for the three amigos yeah professor I'm having too much fun with you because you clearly have caused a a psychological crisis they can't they can't process what you said I just love watch I've watched that clip of you and recipe there five times that I should tell you I want to play for you a clip professor of Christie of Freeland talking about her negotiating style and she uses emojis with hugs this clip I'm about to show you was proudly broadcast by the CBC state broadcaster as a as in admiration in they were thrilled that this new woke style of diplomacy was right like what I'm about to show you is a clip not walking by praising take a quick look at this and I'd like your views afterwards the European trade commissioner Cecilia malmstr√∂m and I call each other sisters in trade we sign our emails hugs yes we do well we sometimes send each other smiley faces in particularly difficult moments you know does that work with with Ambassador Light Heiser the the guy who eats nails for breakfast the US trade rep do you think sending him emojis of hugs it's enough to warm his cold heart I don't think it does and I don't think it works with Mike Pompeo either I mean it's it's it's Oh golly it's at the level of middle school and and it should be you're right it should be embarrassing for Canadians but instead it's you know a wonderful but you know that the fact is we're going to see what happens before very long with respect to the trade this was the big one and you know if Canada is forced to give up stuff that actually works pretty well like dispute resolution to get the deal or if Canada fails to get the deal which is more likely you know then reality should come crushingly down in the face of all of this smarm and that's the thing I mean Chrystia Freeland was in Berlin the day that Trump announced with his Mexican counterpart the deal she was in Berlin giving that same foreign policy speech poking at Trump she was talking to German diplomats pandering to their anti-americanism instead of being at the White House let me throw one more thing at you and I'm not sure if you saw this in The Wall Street Journal the other day professor but the Mexican Foreign Minister and Trump has disparaged Mexico on Twitter more than any other country more even than China I put it to you he always had an undercurrent of respect for China but he he was hostile to Mexico and yet the foreign minister of Mexico had 45 visits to the White House and ten visits to Jared Kirchner's personal home that's according to Wall Street of 55 face-to-face meetings and you never saw him giving disparaging speeches you never see him rising to the bait getting into Twitter fights with Donald Trump over his taco tweets he just quietly got the deal while our gender quota foreign minister is sending hugs emojis and she's not even invited the White House she's meeting with you know the trade rep I think Canada has frittered away our angle we used to be the best buddy of America now we're we're trying to get in on the side yeah absolutely I mean I guess it for people like real and it's much more important to be liked by the American Left which despises Trump than to actually have a trade deal which will provide jobs for Americans and that's a betrayal of Canada all right I like bashing the Liberals cuz I think they're bad I think they're bad for Canada and I think that the rest of the media is in love with them and we need a counterpoint to that but let me put on my nationalist pride my Canadian patriotism and say we need to save the Canadian auto industry by we mean eighties I mean I know Donald Trump would prefer those factories to be in median Ohio Pennsylvania it really is a zero-sum game those cars will be made in one place I mean I guess they're they're actually made on both sides of the border the the the industry is so integrated but I think Donald Trump really wants to move our Canadian factories to Michigan Ohio he'd have those states wrapped up for 2020 what can Canada do now to to salvage things I don't want Canada to humiliate itself I just want Canada to keep the factories and keep our preferred status with America what would your advice be that Chrystia Freeland if she even listened to white males of over 40 like yeah I mean she wouldn't even talk to you because you're obviously a racist sexist Islamophobe but if if she would what would advice would you take I have debated her actually we have she yeah I have actually and and she's not a fool which leads me to think that she'd be quite happy the whole thing went south from our perspective now speaking though I'm a joint Canadian American as an American it really would be in America's interest to get that deal but if it doesn't happen by virtue of Canadian obstreperous then perhaps you know we'll have a period of readjustment where the supply chain in Oshawa and Windsor moves south Canada is actually a good deal for the United States right in terms of Trade and the Canadians have tried to make that point but but they've really failed you know I I also was up in Ottawa back in February talking about this and what I said is the Liberal Party is not the party of John Manley right he was the guy who said all free trade with anybody who free trades with me it's more like the liberal party of John Turner if you remember the 1988 election it is increasingly nationalistic in the bad sense of you know raising borders and no trucker trade with the Yanks and that's just if that happens that would kill off a lot of jobs and maybe that's what they want I mean what I speculated was that given the fact that they're so hardcore left-wing up in Ottawa with the Liberal government what they really might want to do is take a page from Justin's father again with petrol can and you know produce a Canadian you go right which would be running on the fumes of green smarm unless it's cloudy in which case we'll run oh my god a solar-powered battery-powered Canadian you go no one tell Catherine McKenna your idea because I fear that will be a liberal campaign platform in the 2019 election professor it's great to catch up with you I had way too much fun watching your interview and playing back those Christy Freeland clips to you but thanks for joining us and I hope that the sound policy will prevail here but I fear that you're correct I appreciate you taking the time with us thanks so much for having me all right there you have it that's professor Frank Buckley he's the author of a new book called the Republic can workers party how the Trump victory drove everyone crazy and why it was just what we needed I haven't read that yet but it is absolutely on my reading list it sounds like something we talk about a lot on the show here so perhaps on another occasion we'll have the professor back to talk about his book you'll love it it's it's got a bitch slap on every page right well professor thanks again for your time that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezra lavance show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue interview a guest and read my fan mail and my hate mail to subscribe go to the rebel da media slash shows you
