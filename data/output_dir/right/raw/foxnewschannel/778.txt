00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,375
HIS MOTHER WAS PROBABLY

20
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,212
DRYING REAL HARD.

PAIN THESE POOR FAMILIES ARE

29
00:00:47,723 --> 00:00:49,091
SUFFERING WHICH IS AUTHENTIC

30
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,527
AND POLITICIZING IT.

31
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:51,827
RIGHT?

32
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:53,862
IT IS MONSTROUS TO TAKE

33
00:00:53,862 --> 00:00:56,031
THESE FOLKS' PAIN AND USE TO

34
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:58,767

RESPOND TO THAT THAT IS SO

38
00:01:06,642 --> 00:01:08,077
ANGRY BECAUSE OUR VOICES

39
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:09,011
NEED TO BE HEARD.

40
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:09,945
OUR CHILDREN'S VOICES NEED

41
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:10,546
TO BE HEARD.

42
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:11,580
WE NEED TO HEAR THE OTHER

43
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,748
SIDE OF THIS.

44
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:13,849
>> Laura: YOUR DAUGHTER IS

45
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:14,216

>> YOU KNOW, IT'S

51
00:01:21,824 --> 00:01:22,224
RIDICULOUS.

52
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:23,092
I WAS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST

53
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:24,493
THIS LONG BEFORE TRUMP

54
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:25,728
ANNOUNCED HE WAS EVEN

55
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:27,096
RUNNING TO BE PRESIDENT.

56
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:28,631
OUR CHILDREN NEED TO HAVE A

57
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,132
VOICE AND WE ARE TRYING TO

58
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:33,302
RAISE AWARENESS AND EDUCATE

PEOPLE AND PREVENT FUTURE

60
00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:36,972
DEATHS.

I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS

68
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,349

WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO

FACE TO FACE AND TELL ME HOW

77
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,131
THIS IS PROPAGANDA.

SHE HAS NO -- SHE JUST HAS

88
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,478
NO GROUND, SHE HAS NO SOUL

89
00:02:16,478 --> 00:02:17,212
AND NO HEART.

90
00:02:17,212 --> 00:02:19,281
I PRAY TO GOD SHE NEVER

00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,951
