1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
the general election is coming up the

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">7th of May and I'm really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous for me</font>

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,310
it feels<font color="#E5E5E5"> like even more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it all the</font>

4
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,960
elections of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,940
in the first one I can remember was when

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,590
Tony Blair was elected for the first

7
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,540
time I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like someone else is taking</font>

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,070
hold of the message and this always

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,230
happens necessarily because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parties</font>

10
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,210
decide their strongest points and they

11
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,800
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really campaign to push those</font>

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,240
points to the forefront then at the same

13
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the media doing the same</font>

14
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,539
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this whole back-and-forth of</font>

15
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:26,430
what should we be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but here</font>

16
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,560
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet al and I love we've been</font>

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,359
talking about so many social issues over

18
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,859
the past few years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you go into</font>

19
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">these discussions and they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

20
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,040
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same or things in the</font>

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,840
same old ways and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only thing that is</font>

22
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,450
new is the nakedness of some of the

23
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,879
racial attitudes and the racist

24
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,649
attitudes another thing that happens is

25
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:45,510
that when the discussion is concentrated

26
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,829
online or that there is a lot of

27
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:48,450
discussion online we tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a very</font>

28
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,610
us centric approach and we fail to look

29
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,840
at the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's happening over</font>

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">here like for example the fact that</font>

31
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,949
young black minority ethnic males are 29

32
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,899
times more likely to be stopped<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

33
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,160
stop and search and we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

34
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about incarceration in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK which we</font>

35
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,399
do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be talking about and we're</font>

36
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,019
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about sexism in the</font>

37
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,400
workplace and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way that we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

38
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,780
talking about it he gets a line in the

39
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,880
manifesto it gets people kind of winking

40
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,680
at it a little bit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't have</font>

41
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,360
its proper place there because people

42
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,580
see it as a specialist issue and people

43
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,590
see it as a pink bus issue rather than

44
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,240
everyone's issue and when I was all

45
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ballot leaders live and I</font>

46
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked Nick Clegg what is your party</font>

47
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,310
going to do to promote equality from a

48
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,049
young age among everyone they said oh

49
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,060
you know my wife's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to schools and</font>

50
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving talks about equality that's kind</font>

51
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:30,240
of where he left it after all these

52
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,070
conversations that is a big focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

53
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,750
you have on that like that to me is

54
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,729
disappointing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is horrendously</font>

55
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,650
disappointing and I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappointed</font>

56
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,720
by every single party or like<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

57
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,549
Miliband same time and time again all

58
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,170
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aren't prejudiced when they</font>

59
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,670
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about immigration it's something</font>

60
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,750
else I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very aware</font>

61
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">not equipment prejudice yeah its</font>

62
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,229
precious<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prejudice is there Oh</font>

63
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,850
anyway I'm gonna get myself in tizzy

64
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,200
anyway when I try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about these</font>

65
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,880
issues one thing I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> back a lot is</font>

66
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,920
well this election isn't about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

67
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,020
election<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about women this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> election</font>

68
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,640
isn't about welfare this election is

69
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,409
about prison this<font color="#E5E5E5"> election is it about</font>

70
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,960
transphobia this elec

71
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,790
isn't about race that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this election</font>

72
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,430
isn't about asylum seekers one who made

73
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,229
you the person who got to decide what

74
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,610
this election is about why are you

75
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,110
sticking to what someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is who's</font>

76
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,310
telling you what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this election is about</font>

77
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,650
very like incest you staying within

78
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,690
papers and within the political debates

79
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,560
and all these things like they're

80
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,580
deciding what they want to talk about

81
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,130
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's kind of a fast in a lot of</font>

82
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,840
ways they're like circling the wagons I

83
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,489
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get out my head been lying</font>

84
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:27,410
for the west wing when CJ's talking to

85
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,840
Charlie and says everyone's stupid in an

86
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,580
election yet charlie which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

87
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard said to say and Charlie responds no</font>

88
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,959
everyone gets treated stupid in an

89
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,030
election year CJ and that's so true<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

90
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,350
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to resist that because</font>

91
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,670
the big conversation may want to have

92
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">over there when they're all talking to</font>

93
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,340
each other and their<font color="#E5E5E5"> little circle</font>

94
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,050
that's the been for us that benefits the

95
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,489
person closest to the microphone and

96
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,500
these people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been by and large</font>

97
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,360
closest to the microphones with the day

98
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,920
they were born talk about the issues

99
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,420
that matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you and I would love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

100
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,920
see loads of videos over the next couple

101
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">of weeks about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues that are</font>

102
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,040
making you vote and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making you think</font>

103
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,260
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 13 that you wish your MPs would be</font>

104
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,970
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about I'm a huge example of this</font>

105
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,100
me has been george the poet who is my

106
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,480
favorite / at the moment I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the</font>

107
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,739
privilege of seeing him live in two

108
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,200
occasions recently I went to the Notting

109
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,299
Hill electric cinema and I saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

110
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:13,250
intimate gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> and discussion that so he</font>

111
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,600
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about education he had the</font>

112
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,130
director of teach first there he was

113
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,360
going about the prison system he also

114
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,820
had the director I think maybe CEO of

115
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,799
mind the mental<font color="#E5E5E5"> health charity and</font>

116
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,900
someone also<font color="#E5E5E5"> from an autism charity and</font>

117
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last person years ahead there was so</font>

118
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">Campbell and in between each of the</font>

119
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,060
conversations George would deliver his

120
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,100
poems and his powers from search party

121
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,360
which are just so relevant to life in a

122
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,190
city and life in the UK<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

123
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,510
especially for young people don't

124
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably make a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more videos</font>

125
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,269
actually about George Burke because he

126
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,829
was so dear to my heart right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but</font>

127
00:03:42,829 --> 00:03:43,880
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now he's going to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off the</font>

128
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">Booker nut bit which obviously looks</font>

129
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,570
like a newspaper cover are so many

130
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">levels it's such a strong cover because</font>

131
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,660
he's putting himself forefront of the

132
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,670
news news is kind of failing us in a way

133
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,859
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> in these papers aren't doing what we</font>

134
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,910
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing they're</font>

135
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,230
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the conversations they should</font>

136
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,430
be having so we need something to either

137
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,470
supplement that or replace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or add a</font>

138
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,540
voice or do something different and that

139
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,370
to me is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this cover says and on the</font>

140
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,930
back as well it kind of continues that

141
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,060
newsprint theme but it's all very much

142
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,819
hand your letters and hand printed

143
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,950
kind of that crafting there's a thing of

144
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,900
like being pushed on it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it to</font>

145
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,728
be of value you need to own property<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

146
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:19,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a value neat to be X Y Zed we are</font>

147
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,680
a value<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's a value it's human value</font>

148
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,289
but at the same time it's also like we

149
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,180
are a very creative nation I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

150
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are afraid to say that because</font>

151
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">they think that that's something to look</font>

152
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:30,349
down on us thing I really love about

153
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:32,030
this is that at the events of vintage

154
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,259
I've been selling the book as well it

155
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:35,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">just looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like bunch of newspapers all</font>

156
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,820
that there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's wonderful I also at</font>

157
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,590
the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really effectuated with</font>

158
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,870
like little slim hardbacks partly

159
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,370
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really liked carry my</font>

160
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,750
bags then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course love with the end</font>

161
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,520
pages is this some kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of</font>

162
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">George's bar and the line that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

163
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,509
around the back I really hope it does

164
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,000
well have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it treat sometimes is hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

165
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,860
share and hard to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right people</font>

166
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,479
to share with because people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

167
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,220
these preconceptions about poetry but I

168
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,930
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like now is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment to share</font>

169
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of what's going on and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

170
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,650
conversations that aren't happening and

171
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if people don't feel like they're</font>

172
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,620
politically minded I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

173
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,030
things that they were recognized in

174
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,979
George's poetry and in his ability to

175
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,750
create poetry<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the weird disconnect</font>

176
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,550
varsity and other people who are

177
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,349
choosing to look away rather than lick

178
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,940
in the face of what's going on in a

179
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,710
quality and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so may different situations</font>

180
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:21,169
but also real lack of communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

181
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,970
this kind of damning of communication

182
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,639
fingers so much in search party and I

183
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,530
hope you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it or a skirt chance to</font>

184
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,820
check out some of his opponents but I'm

185
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave that there for now</font>

186
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,099
there's so much more to say about drew

187
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:33,320
the poet and his poetry in<font color="#E5E5E5"> London how he</font>

188
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,880
talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the music industry and how</font>

189
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,130
he talks about poetry and how he talks

190
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,599
about our development and where he

191
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,699
started in his story his relationship to

192
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,380
education and there's so much more to

193
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,030
say but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna leave you with</font>

194
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for now and I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked I</font>

195
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:47,240
honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely would adore to see</font>

197
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:51,320

00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,820
more in the election the issues close to

199
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,620
your heart and maybe I can find some way

200
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,990
of compiling them before sense of May

201
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,580

payday

205
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:11,789
a generation came of age in the

206
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:14,610
financial crisis but what does this mean

207
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,400
in real time what's the state of play

208
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,370
for the day to day what do they eat at

209
00:06:20,370 --> 00:00:00,000
mealtimes maybe they feel fine
