THE 
DEPARTMENT 
OF 
JUSTICE 
ISSUED
ITS OWN OPINIONS ON HIS OWN
STATEMENT, DEVON O'MALLEY A
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN
SAID THE BRIEF WAS CONSISTENT
WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S
A LONG-STANDING POSITION IN THE
HOLDINGS OF 10 DIFFERENT
COURT OF APPEALS MISTER O'MALLEY
ADDING THAT THE FILING
REAFFIRMS THE DEPARTMENT'S
FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT THE
CANNOT EXPEND A LOT BEYOND
WHAT CONGRESS HAS PROVIDED.
HERE IS WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO
BE TALKING ABOUT.
TITLE VII IS A PRETTY BROAD
REACHING RED STATUE THAT DOESN'T
NECESSARILY OUTLINE EVER TO HAVE
A PROTECTION THAT IT AFFORDS,
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS UNDER
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IS
INTERPRETIVE IN ONE WAY ANOTHER
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THAT DURING
THEIR WEIGHT AROUND SAYING WE
INTERPRETED TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY,
BUT THERE IS AN ACTUALLY FEDERAL
PRECEDENT THAT IS BINDING HERE.
SCOTUS HASN'T SPOKE OUT ON THIS.
WITH THAT SAID, I WANT TO KNOW
POLITICAL PARTIES ASIDE,
WHOSE INTERPRETATION IS CORRECT.
PREPARE TO BE A LITTLE SURPRISED
AT LEAST AND DISAPPOINTED IN ME.
I AGREE WITH THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION.
I AM FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE
JUDICIALLY.
DON'T GET ME WRONG, I DON'T
AGREE WITH THE POLICIES AT ALL.
THE IDEA THAT YOU SHOULD BE
ALLOWED TO DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST LGBT COMMUNITY IS
LOATHSOME, RIDICULOUS,
POSTURES, AND UN-AMERICAN.
BUT TITLE VII SAYS THAT YOU
CANNOT STAMINA BASED ON
RACE, COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, OR
NATIONAL ORIGIN.
IT DOES IS A SEXUAL IDENTITY,
AND IT SHOULD.
THEY SHOULD PASS A LAW
IMMEDIATELY SAYING THAT,
BUT THEY HAVEN'T.
AND AS THE CONSERVATIVE LAWYERS
POINT OUT HERE, OVER AND
OVER AGAIN CONGRESS HAS HAD
EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THE
WORLD TO PASS A LOT AND HAS
CHOSEN NOT TO.
THIS IS WHERE AGAIN WHAT IT
MEANS TO BE CONSERVATIVE
JUDICIALLY IS NOT POLITICALLY
CONSERVATIVE, BUT TO SAY
WE'RE GOING TO INTERPRET WHAT IS
IN THE LAW.
OFTENTIMES, I THINK SO-CALLED
CONSERVATIVE JURORS WILL TWIST
THE LAW TO GET TO THEIR OWN
OPINION, BUT IF YOU DON'T DO
THAT, YOU JUST LOOK AT THE TEXT
OF THIS BILL, IT DOESN'T SAY
SEXUAL IDENTITY SO I ACTUALLY
THINK THEY ARE RIGHT ABOUT THIS.
AGAIN, ONE LESS THING ABOUT WHAT
I DISAGREE WITH THEM ABOUT.
CHUM CLAIMED THAT HE WAS GOING
TO BE A BIGGER FRONT OF THE
LB GT COMMUNITY THAN HILLARY
CLINTON OR ANYONE ELSE AND
IT WAS GOING TO MAKE YOUR HEAD
SPIN.
NO, I TOLD YOU HE WAS FULL OF
CRAP.
OF COURSE HE IS.
HE WAS NEVER GOING TO BE A
FRIEND TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY.
IF HE WAS, EVEN IF HE DID THIS
ON PRINCIPLE, LAUGH ALONG
WITH ME, HE WOULD THEN PROPOSE
HEY, HE WOULD GET HIS FRIENDS IN
THE SENATE TO PROPOSE A BUILD UP
A SEXUAL IDENTITY IN THE BILL.
HE ALWAYS INTENDED TO
DISCRIMINATE.
FIRST OF ALL, IF I EVER GO
SKYDIVING, I ONLY WANT TO
GO SKYDIVING WITH A GAY MAN, SO
WET THAT JUST BE CLEAR.
REST IN PEACE, SIR.
BUT I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHEN IT COMES
TO THIS, BECAUSE YOU GUYS BOTH
SAID THE SAME THING TO ME THAT
YOU TOLD ME BEFORE THE SHOW,
EVERYTHING THAT OBAMA DID, THIS
ADMINISTRATION IS SO FOCUSED ON
DOING, UNDOING WHAT OBAMA
DID THAT THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT
THE PEOPLE.
I GUESS TO PROVE TO THE PEOPLE
THAT THEY WERE GOING TO
KEEP THEIR WORD, THAT THEY ARE
GOING TO UPHOLD AND PUT AN
END, ENDORSED THEIR BIGOTRY.
IT IS JUST A FRUSTRATING.
IT IS
LIKE I SAID BEFORE, THERE
ARE APPLES IN THE WHITE HOUSE
THAT WAS THERE WHEN OBAMA
WAS PRESIDENT THROW THEM ALL OUT
AND HAVE ONLY ORANGES.
IT'S LIKE CONSTANTLY LET'S GET
RID OF THAT NAME.
EVEN PEOPLE AT RISK OF LOSING
THEIR HEALTH CARE BECAUSE
THE NAME IS ATTACHED, BUT IT'S
OBVIOUS AND ANNOYING.
BUT WHAT I THINK ABOUT THESE
CONSERVATIVES THAT ARE
ALWAYS CLAIMING TO UPHOLD
MORALITY, THEIR MORALITY IS
ALWAYS AT THE EXPENSE OF
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HUMANITY
AND THAT IS WHAT IS SO
FRUSTRATING THAT WE TO THIS
DAY, THE SHIRT THAT I SAW AT THE
MARCH, THIS OLDER WHITE WOMAN.
SHE WAS MAYBE 70.
SHE WAS LIKE I CAN'T BELIEVE I
STILL HAVE TO MARCH FOR THE SHIT.
THAT WE ARE STILL HAVING DEBATES
ABOUT THE PEOPLE BEING ABLE
TO HAVE RIGHTS AND NOT BEING
HARASSED AND DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST THAT WORKED OUT
CAN I BUILD UP THAT WILL
QUICKENING GRACE, I'M SUPER
CURIOUS LIKE YOUR OPINION ON
THIS.
DEMOCRATS, WHY DON'T YOU
PROPOSE A BILL THAT PUTS SEXUAL
IDENTITY AND TITLE VII AND
PUT THE REPUBLICANS ON THE
SPOT, BECAUSE HISTORY IS ON YOUR
SIDE.
BEST OF ALL, THE PRESENT IS ON
YOUR SIDE.
NOW A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT LGBT
PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY HUMANS.
WHAT?
I KNOW, RIGHT?
AND SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS
AS EVERYBODY ELSE.
YOU WOULD WIN TODAY AND THEN
LATER, WHEN THAT NUMBER
MOVES TO WHATEVER IT IS TODAY,
57 WHATEVER IT IS TONIGHT 77 AND
97, YOU'LL HAVE THEM ON THE
RECORD AS THE PEOPLE WHO NEVER
BELIEVED IN THE QUALITY AND
YOU NEVER BELIEVED IN AMERICA IN
THE FIRST PLACE.
CENK UYGUR, THAT IS EXACTLY
WHERE I STAND ON THIS.
I THINK THAT I WANT TO SEE
ACTION FROM PEOPLE WHO
ASSERT THAT THEY ARE ALLIES
FOR THE LGBT COMMUNITY TO
PROPOSE SOMETHING SO WOULD HAVE
TO DEAL WITH THIS SORT OF LEGAL
LOOPHOLE WHICH AGAIN, I HAD TO
WRITE MY THOUGHTS DOWN BECAUSE
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE I AM
VERY CLOSE TO, AND IS NOTING
DIRECT THE DOJ IS NOT DEAD WRONG
IN THEIR INTERPRETATION BECAUSE
THEY ARE NOT ARGUING AGAINST
BINDING PRIOR COURT DECISIONS.
WHAT IS GOING TO COME DOWN TO
THE PROCLIVITIES OF THE
SECOND CIRCUIT WHICH FORTUNATELY
IS A FAIRLY LIBERAL CIRCUIT
WITHOUT A TRUMP APPOINTEE BUT
RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST KIND
OF CROSSING OUR FINGERS THAT
THEY WILL HAVE A LIBERAL
AND PROGRESSIVE INTERPRETATION
OF TITLE 7.
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HOPE FOR
THAT ANYMORE IN 2017.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE
INTRODUCTION OF A BILL THAT
PEOPLE CAN VOTE ON SO THAT
PEOPLE WILL GO ON THE
RECORD, ARE YOU AN ALLEY OR NOT?
IT WOULD BE SUCH AS CLEAR-CUT
ISSUE.
YOU BELIEVE I SHOULD BE FIRED
FOR BEING GAY?
I REALLY THINK THAT THAT IS
WHERE WE ARE AT BECAUSE IT
IS DISHEARTENING TO LOOK AT
THIS AND THINK WELL, YEAH,
ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY THERE
ISN'T A BINDING FEDERAL
PRECEDENT HERE AND THERE IS
NO MENTION OF SEXUAL
ORIENTATION IN TITLE VII SO
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION
WAS LENIENT ON THEIR
INTERPRETATION AND
2014 2015 SAW SOME
ADMINISTRATION MEMOS AND
ISSUES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT
TITLE VII IS TO PROTECT ON
THE BASIS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION
BUT NOTHING IN WRITING.
LET'S GET SOMETHING IN WRITING
AND TAKE ACTION.
I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH JUST
TRUSTING AND ADMINISTRATION
OF HER BEST INTEREST AT HEART
BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT
WHAT THEY'RE DOING UNDER GENERAL
SESSIONS.
THEY DON'T CARE.
IN
FACT, THEY ARE ACTING
SPECIFICALLY, ALTHOUGH THEY DID
ISSUE THIS AMICUS BRIEF,
THEY DIDN'T NEED TO.
THIS DIDN'T CONCERN THEM REALLY.
THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL
FILING.
THEY JUST WANTED TO THROW THEIR
WEIGHT AROUND JUST TO SAY,
JUST YOU KNOW, WE'RE THE NEW
SHERIFF IN TOWN RIGHT NOW
SO DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE.
BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE
IS THAT THEY TRY FEAR
LAMBDA LEGAL WILL COME OUT ISSUE
ANOTHER THIRD-PARTY OPINION
AND THAT WILL BE TAKEN INTO
CONSIDERATION BEFORE THERE
IS A CORE ANALYSIS.
GAYS FOR TRUMP, IF YOU LOOK AT
THE HASHTAG THERE ARE SO
MANY GAY PEOPLE WHO ARE FOR TRUMP.
I LAUGH AT THEM LIKE I LAUGH AT
THE LATINAS FOR TRUMP, BUT
THERE ARE SO MANY GAY PEOPLE,
AND THE PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW BELOW,
THE DEVIL GUY, THERE'S SO MANY
PEOPLE WHO ARE BEHIND THIS
AND THIS IS WITH EVERY GROUP
THAT WAS SUPPORTING TRUMP.
IT IS YOUR TURN THIS TIME.
I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE I GET
HARASSED BY GAYS FOR TRUMP ON
TWITTER.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU THINK,
BECAUSE I SPEAK OUT AGAINST TRUMP
AND THEYíRE LIKE, HEíS PROGRESSIVE.
BUT THEY ARE LIKE WE DONíT WANT
TO BE ATTACHED TO PEOPLE THAT
NEED AND DON'T WANT TO PULL
THEMSELVES UP BY THE BOOTSTRAPS.
THAT APPLIES TO EVERY GROUP.
THERE ARE A LOT OF GAY ELITISTS
OUT THERE WHO VOTED FOR
TRUMP AND NOW HERE IT IS.
YOU CAN BE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST
AND HARASSED AT YOUR JOB
AND IT IS NOT AGAINST THE LAW.
NOW WHAT I WANT TO HEAR FROM
YOU.
YOU WANT TO TWEET AT ME,
TWEET ME ABOUT THAT.
LAST COUPLE OF THINGS ON
THIS.
ONE IS, I KNOW THAT IT IS OPEN
TO INTERPRETATION, BUT I
THINK YOU ARE REALLY STRETCHING
INTERPRETIVELY TO SAY THAT
SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS IN THERE
WHEN IT IS NOT.
I KNOW YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT
ABOUT HEY, THESE ARE
GENERALLY PROTECTING RIGHTS.
I UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT.
GOTTA BE HONEST, I DON'T AGREE
WITH IT, THAT IS WHY ONE OF
BILL AND NOT JUST IN
INTERPRETATION, BUT DON'T
THINK THEY'RE ACTING ON A
PRINCIPAL.
HE DID THIS ON THE DAY THAT HE
WAS GETTING TREMENDOUS HEAT
FOR THE RUSSIAN CONNECTIONS AND
FIRING OF MOELLER.
HE DID THE TRAINS BEEN IN THE
MILITARY AND THE SAME DAY.
IT IS REDMEAT FOR HIS BASE.
IT IS A VERY MINOR ISSUE IN
TERMS OF THE LEGAL PRECEDENT
THAT IS BEING SET.
IT IS
IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF CIVIL
RIGHTS, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO OUT
OF PRINCIPLE RANDOMLY ON THIS
DAY.
ITíS THE REASON
THE GAYS FOR TRUMP AND ALL
THOSE GUYS SAY THEY ARE PAPER,
THEY WILL SAY THEY ARE IN
FAVOR OF THIS.
ALL THEY WANT IS ATTENTION.
HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT
PROTECTING HIS BASE.
YOU CARE ABOUT ANYBODY BUT
HIMSELF.
HERE, THIS IS ANOTHER
OPPORTUNITY TO SELF
AGGRANDIZE AND I WILL GET EVEN
MORE ATTENTION FOR SAYING
I'M AGAINST GAYS WHEN I AM
GAY.
YES, MY CAREER AT THE EXPENSE OF
EVERYONE ELSE AND FINALLY,
EXACTLY RIGHT, ALL OF THE
SUPPORTERS INCLUDING PETER
THIEL WHO IS A VERY WEALTHY
SILICON VALLEY INVESTOR WHO
DID THAT SPEECH AT THE
CONVENTION FOR DONALD TRUMP.
HE HAPPENS TO BE GAY.
HE IS LIKE
TRUMP WILL BE FINE, I WANT MY
TAX CUTS.
WHAT NOW?
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT.
MAYBE YOU THINK I DON'T CARE, I
WILL THROW THE REST OF MY
COMMUNITY UNDER THE BUS BECAUSE
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE AN
EXTRA BUCK BUT AT LEAST BE
HONEST ABOUT IT BECAUSE
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
BOOTSTRAPS, WELL, IF YOU WORK
SUPER HARD AND YOU GOT A GREAT
JOB AND YOU PULLED YOURSELF UP
BY THE BOOTSTRAPS, NOW THEY
CAN JUST FIRE YOU FOR BEING GAY,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DID.
