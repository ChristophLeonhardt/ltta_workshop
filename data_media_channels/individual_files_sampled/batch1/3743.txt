the forecast for 2010 was that it was supposed to be the year of the IPO we were going to see facebook maybe linkedin Zynga Twitter or anybody you know IPO big big year these companies are global brands they have over a hundred million dollars in revenue not not Twitter of course and all these companies responded sort of saying nothing soon we even saw from from Yuri Miller who's an investor in facebook maybe next year maybe 2011 some are pushing it further further and further back so given that all these companies have passed this litmus test of should go IPO they have a hundred million dollars in revenue this year they'll have it next year we'll have it for the foreseeable future why what is their actual position in public this is what a reader wants to know is 2010 not going to be the year as many forecasted and here's the reason basically what's going on what you're seeing is you're seeing large holding companies come in and basically take the place of the public markets in several instances and sort of provide semi exits so in 2009 we saw facebook get a 500 million dollar investment from a Russian company called Digital Sky technologies and basically this was what happens is the founders don't want to go public yet because they don't want to have to answer to public shareholders produce quarter after quarter results but they want to provide an exit for many of their employees and early investors so a big holding company comes along and says this is a pretty sure bet this company's going to go public eventually they're going to be worth billions and billions of dollars and we're going to get our return and they just you know it sort of helps them stay semi private ty entirely private so Yelp for example got a hundred million dollar investment earlier this year from elevation partners and Zynga which we've heard you know range you know revenue ranges have approached 250 million dollars and that was just 2009 so who knows what they'll be in 2010 anyway they got 180 million dollars also from Digital Sky technologies and Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook and Mark Pincus from zynga get to keep running a private company they don't have to answer to public shareholders lots of their employees get a pretty nice return and early investors do and they get to just keep chugging along and building it to something that's going to be a complete surefire bet in the public markets at least it's the goal so anyway holding company is stepping in allowing entrepreneurs to keep running private companies that's why we're not seeing IPOs thanks for joining us
