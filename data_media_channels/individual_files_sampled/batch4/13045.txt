after a big news week CNN has decided to hire a few more people in their latest attempt to make their staff as big as their audience one position that CNN is advertising as vice president in charge of google ID hysteria this is an on-air spot so it's available only to white women homosexual men and the relatives of major Democrats with IQs and low double digits the vice president in charge of google ID hysteria has the responsibility of setting this hair on fire and running into camera shot screaming like a lunatic every time Donald Trump says or does anything that involves Russia immigration the Supreme Court or something that can be somehow construed to have an adverse effect on black people qualifications for this position include the ability to make a high-pitched warbling sound while simultaneously turning in circles with flames shooting out of your head CNN hopes that hiring a vice president of Google ID hysteria will lessen the workload on Don Lemon who now will only be expected to look solemnly into camera while saying stop please stop over and over please stop it please stop another position that CNN will soon fill is on the scene screamer of stupid questions at public officials since White House correspondent Jim look at me I'm Jim Acosta cannot physically be in two places at the same time in fact he can't mentally be in even one place at the same time the new on the scene screamer of stupid questions of public officials will be tasked with drawing attention to himself for no apparent reason at locations which Acosta either can't reach or which he has reached and is now just standing there staring into space wondering why no one gives a damn the on the scene screamer will also do occasional live spots on Wolf Blitzer show where he'll say something angry sounding while seeming to think someone is paying attention finally CNN will also be advertising for a new curvaceous and yet vaguely serious looking white woman there are only three requirements for this position I forget the third one trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right the last day of the Clavin week in the Clavin las' weekend beckons to us like a dark pit filled with fire and disaster but hey you got 45 more minutes ah we got it we have a terrific interview with Congressman Matt Gaetz say I really thought it was an interesting substantive interview maybe even news making I don't know we'll see really interesting we will stay on and let you listen to that even if you're just on Facebook or YouTube but all the more reason for

I've been wanting to talk about all week but there's been so crazy with all the news that I haven't really gotten around to it but I want to talk about it today because it actually is symbolic of what's been happening all week it is a good way to get into the theme of what's been happening all week which is this new show from Sasha Sasha Baron Cohen now I don't like going III think I have said this since Borat I wrote a piece for PJ media about this when Borat came out I said I said this on the conversation the other day he's a funny talented man and what he does is wrong and that is something that you know we really have to understand that that's possible like Eminem a talented writer of songs who writes songs that are ugly and disgusting and encourage people who don't know any better to have a really bad attitude sort of women the police you know it is possible to be incredibly cool and incredibly bad and you cannot succumb to the tyranny of cool when I wrote this piece about Cohen about Borat for PG a media I got all this blowback from people saying no no you don't understand he's funny I know he's funny I can see he's funny but when you take a camera crew to ordinary people and trick them into making fun of themselves you it is such an imbalance of power you have all that power of moviemaking of audience and they've got nothing and it's easy to make fun of people he I have seen him make fun of police trainers guys who train police making fun of them I've seen them make fun of a woman who taught people how to have good manners you know just just just ridiculing her and making her embarrassed on camera and then putting that on camera to make her fun of her that is such an abuse of power I really believe it started with David Letterman I don't have any problem with a guy going out and asking questions of people and the people don't know the answers and that's kind of funny that's one thing they know what they're getting into they walk away if they want to but to pretend you're somebody or not and leave them into making fun of themselves is just wrong it is an abuse of the power of show business and yet and show business has tremendous power so he's got a new show out and of course it's called who is America and he's British by the way so this is this guy from overseas attacking us and he it's a always directed against Middle America he just thinks Middle America is the stupidest thing ever and a lot of attacks on gun rights and so he here's here's a cut of the promo this is Showtime the show did have its debut it didn't do very well and the immediate ratings but I think with the streaming and all that stuff it did fine I find this incredibly anti-semitic a typical Jewish anti-semitism he pretends to be a Israeli guys trying to sell to people the idea that children as young as three should be armed which is funny you know and these guys are public officials so maybe it's not quite as bad as doing ordinary people but still this I found this incredibly NSM inheritance we start the program initially for kindergardens okay we trained them through the age 16 down to the age three yeah well I think it would be a good idea it's genuinely funny I'm not denying it he is a talented funny guy he did get caught I just want to play this part just because I I got a kick out of it North Sweden a California gun owner spotted him in the when he came in and here's a report on that he comes in off the bat you can see the video I'm looking I'm like this guy does not look like a Hungarian immigrant tight leather pants beard it just didn't fit but he says it's what Cohen said after that handshake that really blew his cover one do buddy done like that talking like that and I just kept looking at the guy and I was like you're Borat as soon as I said that his I just looked at me like and he did Abby turned right out the door Sweden says the video shows Cohen bailing on his crew after he gets called out so then he turns to question the producer we're talking to the people they don't want to give us that answer we basically don't get the cow you know you guys are all full I have a great day heat up that's also funny as a cat I said he was Calvary gun owners a gun store owner the guy came into the gun store I love the fact that he ditched his crew I would I would rob I would never leave you but I put you in fry put you in front of me and so I wouldn't get hit by but I would never leave you by like oh here is the thing it's funny there are stupid Republicans and you can get people to say stupid things on camera when they're trying to be nice to you they're trying to be polite you know people are always trying to adjust to you so that it's easy to kind of lure them in to this thing and you can get people to say stupid things but you don't have to fool the Democrats to say so stupid things see this is the difference between the Republicans and the Democrats you can find stupid Republicans a lot of times you'll find them online on the comments section and stuff like that but the Democrats what they believe is stupid this is the party of you know it's a party of socialism it's the party of abortion it's the party that is supporting a corrupt deep state attacking our elected officials this is the party who wear this you know the central premise the central premises of this party is they're in charge the government is charged the government will take care of you but they get to tell you what to do it is completely antithetical to America so my point about this is yeah yeah you can make fun of us you can make fun of Donald Trump when he makes a mistake in Helsinki I think you did make a mistake in Helsinki but who is doing Putin's business who is helping Putin out what does Putin want Putin and he's been you gotta say Putin has been incredibly successful you want to talk about when Trump called the Kim jong-un a talented leader Vladimir Putin is a talented killer he's a talented gangster and we'll get to this in just a minute but first sorry we first we have to talk about software advice and the thing I love about software advice is you say what is

alright so here's the thing who is doing putin's business putin wants to divide us he wants our government mixed up and arguing and screaming at one another he wants to make hot-button issues even hotter who is doing that business Trump has now adjusted his message right he did an interview with CBS and he's now saying oh yes I get it you know I trust the I trust the intelligence people and Putin did in fact hack our elections you haven't condemned Putin specifically do you hold him personally responsible well I would because he's in charge of the country just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country so certainly as the leader of a country you would have to hold him responsible yes did he say that with Putin I have no idea whether he actually said that with Putin but at least he's got the message right now okay so who is doing Putin's business is it Donald Trump for making the same mistake that Obama made and he referenced that thing with Dmitry Medvedev where Obama said oh yeah I'll have more flexibility after the election we can take out the missiles we won't have to put missiles into Europe which he actually didn't do he actually followed up on that and came through that was considered a kind of momentary gaffe a little bit of a blip in Obama's brilliance Trump essentially makes a momentary gaffe and it's Armageddon what serve Putin more us deciding that every time Trump opens his mouth it's Armageddon or Trump saying this that Trump goes on in this interview to point out that the his accusation that the deep state has been corrupted the Department of Justice and our intelligence services have been corrupted by Barack Obama and just deep state arrogance to come after him it is a fair point and he is still making it in this CBS interview that's the next cut do you think any intelligence agencies US intelligence agencies are out to get you well certainly in the past it's been terrible you look at Brennan you look at clapper you look at Hayden you look at Comey you look at McCabe you look at struck and his lover Lisa Paige you look at other people in the FBI that have been fired that are no longer there certainly I can't have any confidence in the past but I can have a lot of confidence in the present and the future because it's getting to be now where we're putting our people in but in the past no I have no confidence in a guy like Brennan I think he's a total lowlife I have no confidence in clapper you know clapper wrote me a beautiful letter when I first went to office and it was really nice and then all of a sudden he's gone haywire because they got to him and they probably got him to say things that maybe he doesn't even mean well he's talking about John Brennan a former communist and see a CIA director and current pompous gasbag who tweeted out that Trump Donald Trump's press conference performance in Helsinki rises and exceeds the threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors it was nothing short of treasonous which helps Putin more you know Trump making a gaffe at a at Helsinki or treated tweeting that the president is committing treason which does put which makes Putin laugh you think about it for a minute who is serving Putin more certainly clapper when clapper falsely claimed that that there was no evidence that NSA was spying on us when he leaked the anti-trump dossier to Jake Tapper and then convinced what did he do he sent Comey in to talk to Trump and then leak that to CNN what's helped you know what is causing more division what is causing more division here is Rand Paul who is no he's no Trump's slave by any stretch of the imagination here's Rand Paul talking about John Brennan you know John Brennan started out as adulthood by voting for the Communist Party presidential candidate he's now ending his career by showing himself to be the most biased bigoted over-the-top hyperbolic sort of unhinged director of the CIA we've ever had and really it's an insult to everything about our government to have a former head of the CIA calling the president treasonous just because he doesn't like him but realize that Brennan you know I filibustered Brennan I I tried to keep Brennan from ever being the leader of the CIA but realize that Brennan and clapper are known for wanting to expand the authority of the intelligence agencies to grab up everyone's information including Americans and so I don't have a lot of respect for these people even before they decided to go on hating the president I dislike these people because they wanted to grab up so much power and use it against the American people and they have and they've used it against the choice of the American people who's Donald Trump he was duly elected president of the United States and they've done nothing but try to undercut and D legitimize his presidency and so as the media and so of the Democrats and what serves Putin more what serves Putin more than that by the way I have to mention you know I mentioned that I met you know this woman Marie abou Tina has now been arrested charged with being a Russian spy and I mentioned that I met her at this David Horowitz event several years ago and she was walking around in this very slinky dress and later I saw her in a almost non-existent bikini and the guy who was leading her around I'm not gonna mention his name but he was a guy you know shows up at these things a conservative guy and I'm such a naive or let's put it this way my mind is so much in the gutter that all I was thinking about is that she was trying to pick up a rich American husband and never occurred to me that she might be a spy and of course I have no secrets to share except how to write a really effective action scene and I thought like I'd have turned that secret over to her in a minute but what was really funny was I she's charged that the guy who was with her when I saw the guy who was with her I thought man he thinks she's gonna sleep with him that's why he's doing this and sure enough they now charge that they were living together which I think just makes me feel a little bit better about myself at least I wasn't a complete naive anyway you know all of this stuff the Democratic Party what does it represent who is in you know it's keith Ellison it's yesterday the you know they have a that kzo Cortez came out with this stupid that every word out of her mouth is like it's stupider than the last word that came out she stops talking she would just get smarter but every word she says is dumber than less so she wants to abolish ice and the Democrats will now jump on anything any stupid idea that somebody who has some popularity has they said yeah abolish ice we got to apologize so in that house the Republicans said okay let's see let's put your money where your mouth is they say put a non-binding resolution to support ice to support the law enforcement work of ice and a hundred and thirty three Democrats voted present unbelievable unbelievable these guys and then they were saying well that's not fair you're making this boat you're making us put our money where our mouth is we just wanted to scream without beat going on record and they scream but there's still children being separated the board these are the people who hate the police they hate ice they hate our borders keith Ellison one of them their congressman he is saying that borders themselves are it's just not fair that we have borders with cut number eleven allow capital to travel over borders and our capital is is people who happen to own something we call a corporation which is a legal arrangement which gives them special rights and labor which is a regular person cannot travel back and forth across the border and so corporations certain people who get certain rights can go back and forth across the border seeking out the lowest wages but people regular people cannot go back and forth across the border seeking out the highest wages so what it creates is an imbalance it creates an injustice that I mean why is that nonsense because American corporations can go out across the border American workers can go somewhere else for better pay American workers can go to another country for better pay what we say because you can't come here and become an America in San Francisco they began registering non-citizens including illegal immigrants to register to vote in the November election for the city school board after a passage of a 2016 ballot measure by San Francisco I mean this is a beautiful city now covered in homeless crap and that crap from homeless people it's a lawless city it's a dangerous city it's an ugly city that used to be beautiful because of the left and now they're letting illegal aliens vote in school board meetings this is who they are you know this is the these are the dealers with Iran who sent them cash on pallets in the middle of the night these are the people who let the rush rushes back into the Middle East in Syria Donald Trump made a mistake who serves Putin's purposes most who doesn't it is definitely the Democrats and it is who they are you know I got to play this clip this is an English clip channel for just ordinary voters I was on the BBC once only one these people only have me on once because once they hear what I'm saying they they only let me on one time and they had they had this thing where a BBC reporter went into Appalachia and interviewed a poor person about why she doesn't like Barack Obama with all the wonderful programs she doesn't know woman said to you know honey you can't you can't spend your way out of debt I said to the BBC guy that woman probably doesn't have a college education she is a better economist than your reporter he wondered why the BBC never had me back but so here you can hear the shock and the British reporter as these Trump voters speak with perfect common sense in the light of the Democrats craziness president Trump's been called a traitor I wonder how you feel about that honestly we laugh out loud when we hear it like what what are we hearing we're on the brink of war no you know President one press meeting right when press guy birthright Awards the public expects nothing less than the from the swamp in DC in their cronies in the media it was a one-hour press conference after a two-hour private meeting we have no idea what happened in the private meeting it was a one-hour press conference and where I'm supposed to change my opinion about a president that's doing all kinds of amazingly positive things because I want our press conference Chicken Little the skies falling in and the American people are getting tired of it you've got Republicans criticized in their never Trump person and you know what we love when Trump is Trump because it exposes them and we we love that we love seeing it we can focus on what Trump says in a press conference or we can focus on what he actually does and he's put people back to work record low unemployment for Hispanics for African Americans record high employment for the whole country look at what he does and it's really it's it speaks to middle America and the swamp may not like it but I don't like and that's why there's creamy pretty low sea you know I have not I have not said the Trump was right I think that Trump Trump not only is wrong in what he did in Helsinki what he said in Helsinki he's wrong in his attitude toward Putin there's no deal to be made with a gangster who wants to wipe you off the face of the earth you can make a deal with a gangster who wants something from you who's like a leech who's gone wants to suck blood out of you because the leech doesn't want to kill the host but if the gangster just wants to wipe you out which is what Putin wants he wants to be Czar of Russia and he wants Russia to crush the competition which is us I don't think there's a deal to be made there and I think Trump is wrong I think he is in the wrong in his approach in his approach to Putin he's not wrong in his approach to Russia he's been very tough on Russia in terms of his deeds but he's wrong in his approach to Putin but how can we even discuss how can we even begin to discuss the right and wrong of what Trump is doing in a calm rational manner if the opposition party is the party of socialism the party of abortion the party of madness screaming at everything he says you know the thing is I did like the part in that where they said we like Donald Trump being Donald Trump I'm reminded always of a wonderful old Errol Flynn movie called The Adventures of Don Juan and you remember Don Juan obvious it was the great lover and at the end of the movie in one of those great moments in the 40s 50s movies where the guy steps essentially out of the screen Errol Flynn turns to Alan Hale I believe it is and he says there's a little bit of Don Juan and every man and since I am Don Juan there must be more of it in me and that's what I think about Donald Trump when I see him you know there's a little bit of Donald Trump in all every man and since he is Donald Trump there's gonna be more of it of him for good and ill but all I'm saying is the Democrats serve Putin's purposes more by keeping this hysteria going over Russian collusion which I do not believe existed and just keeping the hysteria and the anti-trump level at such a high pitch that is what Putin wants Putin doesn't care whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump is president he doesn't give a rat's which one of them is president as long as he can create the kind of chaos that the Democrats more than Trump are helping him create all right we've got this wonderful interview with Matt Gaetz and we will stay on but that is a good reason for you to feel incredibly guilty and go over the Daily wire calm and subscribe Matt Gaetz of course is a member of the hundred and fifteen Congress and serves on the budget armed services and Judiciary Committees his work in Congress focuses on national security tax reform regulatory reform and adherence to constitutional principles he has been a big Trump supporter and a big investigator of the investigation into collusion he speaks about it I thought with incredible candor and depth here and here is the interview congressman thanks so much for coming on I appreciate it honored to be with you well let's begin with the Helsinki summit and the especially the press conference absolute hysteria and craziness what was your what was your reaction to what you saw well I wish there would have been more focused on the positive interactions in the areas of non-proliferation and anti terrorism I think that the United States and Russia have a variety of common interests there there is no mechanism by which we can sufficiently leverage North Korea and Iran in the absence of some semblance of cooperation with Russia that said Russia is not our friend Russia is a competitor they engage in a malign influence campaign all over the world where they disrupt elections and I think that the president likely was better in the private context than in the public context on some of those questions I think that you know we've got to maintain better resiliency in our country I think at the state and local level a lot of work is being done to ensure that we are more resilient with our election systems and I think we can anticipate further foreign attempts at influence going forward in in 2018 and 2020 and beyond you you're a very firm Trump supporter are you confident that he understands who Vladimir Putin is I mean the guy is pretty much a gangster right so ya know I mean look the seminal moment in Putin's life is when he's a cage the agent and he you know and and in East Germany the Berlin Wall Falls Germans surround where he is and he's afraid they're all going to kill him and so he walks out and says that there are a hundred KGB agents inside with guns pointed at everyone and if they wanted to escape with their lives they needed to go home and so that's that kind of frames Putin's fear of any sort of popular uprising and the brutal efforts he's willing to take including killing journalists and killing political opponents in order to maintain power I think the president understands that I think the president was far more focused on some of the objectively measurable outcomes that we could get from broader cooperation on the proliferation space and in the anti-terrorism space now people are hammering the president over the fact that he disrespected our intelligence community over this Russian investigation and there's there are two investigations there's the Russian hacking investigation and then there's this investigation into whether anybody in the Trump campaign colluded with this and they seemed to get kind of smushed together both in the media's mind and in sometimes in the president's mind were you were you upset at all at Muller delivering these indictments these new indictments just before Helsinki did that bother you at all I mean I think that the timing was obvious to essentially troll the struck hearing that we were having in the Congress and also the president's visit but it wasn't frankly the timing wasn't my biggest concern about these indictments there's a reason why we don't do counterintelligence in article 3 US courts I'm conspire more concerned that one of these Russians will show up in the United States and stand on US soil and say I'm here to obtain the full complement of America's constitutional rights I want to engage in discovery I want to take depositions and I want a full trial on these questions I think that that could be more detrimental to our intelligence apparatus then you know then Bob Muller may may suspect so in other words by ending them because they left them open to getting the kind of information they might want to get like you know you know what we ought to do when people interfere with our elect and engage in this type of activity we ought to retaliate with force we should not invite them into an article 3 court for an airing of grievances III think it's far too deferential to the Russians to give them constitutional rights in US courts so so let's talk about this struck hearing it was certainly a lot of fireworks and hilarious fun I mean I had a good time watching it did did you learn anything from this did we learn anything from talking to Peter struck definitely this was the first time at anyone associated with the FBI publicly admitted that the dossier was introduced into the intelligence bloodstream through Bruce or who is the spouse of Nelly or who was hired to work for fusion GPS on the dossier that had been in the noon s memo the FBI issued broad statements that not everything in the new Nest memo was accurate and and this was the first confession that that was the case the same so that's kind of at the outset of the investigation or what I would call the first rotten book end I think on the back end the new revelation we learned is that when Robert Muller brought Peter struck in and dismissed him from the special counsels probe he did not ask a single question about a single text message right like he didn't say well when you said we'll stop him you know what did you mean by that what were you willing to do to stop him and I'm a lawyer and and perhaps one of the things that Bob Muller was doing as an attorney was not asking a question he didn't want the answer to but it's really troubling to me that like when Muller gets rid of struck he has absolutely no curiosity as to the extent to which Struck's bias influenced investigative decisions up to that point hmm now you know those are two facts and and in terms of a structure Lisa page we're getting word that in a closed session she was a little bit more she she cooperated a little bit more were you in on that session yeah Lisa page was definitely more forthcoming than Peter struck now she also maintained that her bias didn't impact any of her decisions bias affects the self conscious unconscious I should say bias can affect you without you knowing it that's the reason why we don't let bias people sit on juries or serve as judges over cases or service prosecutors and so struck and page say we're but yeah you know we we held these views but that didn't invest that didn't impact our investigation so in that sense she was the same as struck but there was one particular text message that struck wouldn't give answers regarding that she did it was the text message contemporaneous with James Comey spiring and and a struck says we've got to open up that case we've been waiting on while Andrew McCabe is the Acting Director and and Paige agrees that they've got to go ahead and do that struck would not answer what that matter was about previously Rosenstein had indicated behind closed doors to some of my colleagues that that had nothing to do with the Russia investigation that was some ancillary matter and we got information from Lisa page that was inconsistent with what Rosenstein had said and far more illuminating than what struck had often you know one of the things always bothers me about bias especially in the media but this is a good example as well is not that individual reporters or editors are biased is that they're surrounded by people who only agree with them so there's nobody there to say oh you're being a little biased let's find a you know more a different way to say that do you have any faith in the Muller investigation at all I don't because you're right it's become an echo chamber forth and never Trump movement I mean when it's hard to understand why Robert Muller would hire as one of the attorneys on his team someone who defended the Clinton Foundation it's hard to understand why he would hire the very person who defended the individual who ran bleach bit over the Hillary Clinton email servers it's hard to understand why he hired Weissman when Weissman had such an active role at literally attending Hillary Clinton's watch night party so when you look at the staffing decisions it's really hard to have confidence now when it comes to the facts that are laid out in the indictments I agree with those facts not based on the fact that Robert Muller presented them but based on the fact that it's consistent with what intelligence officials have said to me all over the world you know as a member of Congress we travel a good amount and when I go to a country I typically meet with the CIA station chief and I have heard a number of stories that I believed to be accurate about how Russia tries to influence and undermine democracies as institutions all over the world and that's entirely consistent with the facts laid out in these indictments but but Muller was appointed not to to investigate the collusion aspect of this wasn't he wasn't that was that was where he was supposed to go not one of those indictments has touched on that correct and one of the things that concerns me is that there don't really seem to be four corners to what we've asked Robert Muller to do Rosenstein provides his initial direction to Muller and gives that to the Congress but then there were subsequent memoranda to Muller expanding his authority that was not shared with the Congress and that really ripens this question right like either at the end of the day it's either elected people that make the final decisions or it's unelected people that make the final decisions in most cases in the executive branch the elected person is the president and that's who's ultimately responsible and their conduct or in they're held accountable by the voters but here since the president is a subject of the investigation you know you have these bureaucrats who believe that they are accountable to no one and whether you're a Republican a Democrat is someone who believes in civil liberties like like I do that should concern all of us that unelected people would have unchecked power to maintain an investigation regarding anything they'd like for as long as they'd like I think that's troubling it it also does seem to me as just an outside observer it seems to me that they're stonewalling you guys and they're actually hostile toward congressional oversight today bill McGurn and the Wall Street Journal suggested that the president Trump should simply declassify all the documents that you're trying to get at so that they can't best redact them all the time or hold back on them what do you think of that idea we do need the president's assistance particularly to declassify documents from before the 31st of July so the Department of Justice has maintained two congressional oversight members that this investigation began on the 31st of July but when I asked Rosenstein before our committee what investigative activity took place before that time he said he would not answer the question well if there was no investigative activity it would just be easy to say there wasn't anything that occurred before the 31st of July and so there are inconsistencies in the responses were getting from DOJ and particularly in those areas where they've said things that cannot be both accurate the president needs to give us access to those foundational documents to understand those questions because what I think happened is that I think that there were people that were paid to go and collect intelligence on the Trump campaign before the Papadopoulos discussion in London and if we got those documents we would be able to prove whether that was the case or not what paid by whom by the by the United States government I mean I believe that we're going to see six-figure payments to people who were then asked to go and run and collect intelligence on the Trump campaign you you believe that the United States government was paying people to collect counter intelligence on the Trump campaign before before there was any information from Papadopoulos or the Australians or anything yeah and my basis for that belief is that when we ask questions about it they won't answer and if the answer was no it'd be very clear it'd be very easy to just say no right now I don't want to you know I don't want to say that I'm certain of that it's my suspicion right and that's how you develop facts throughout throughout a case and so if the president would declassify that information we would see whether or not those payments were in fact made and I think they were but I'm happy to be proven wrong if we get access to the documents or even if we just got straight answers I'd be willing to say that that was an unfounded suspicion but as long as they're stonewalling it really it really raises the question can you think of any reason why President Trump would not declassify these documents you know I think the president really wants to have a hands-off approach to this I think he does understand that his excessive entanglement with the process functions would would be really you know would be a downward pull on his presidency and so I think he's trying not to do that it's a very awkward I Namek right where he is the subject of the investigation yeah but at the same time he is the elective he's the only elected person in the executive branch I I have to ask if you think that the government was paying people to investigate what was essentially the opposing party at that point do you think that this goes up to the White House do you think Obama was involved in those decisions well we asked a lot of questions about what it meant when struck in Page were texting back and forth about the White House wanting to be up-to-date on information and wanting to be involved again I mean I think that that would be a very serious charge but we'll only know the answer if we get the document so I don't want to say that I'm certain of that I don't know if it was a lower level decision but until we're able to really understand that decision tree it really it really undermines the integrity and the independence of the Department of Justice and the FBI because we're left wondering whether or not they were used to obtain a political outcome rather than an investigative outcome wow that's that's really something I you know I have to ask you just a one political question all this just seems like will go away if that if you lose the house of the Republicans lose the house in the midterms how are you feeling about that right now well my concern is that there are people at the Department of Justice who know that and so time is their friend you know the longer we say okay well here's a deadline well now instead of meeting that deadline we're going to have a meeting and then we're gonna have an extension and then we're gonna have redacted documents and they were gonna fight over those redactions and then we're gonna set a new meeting and then a new deadline and have more meetings that seems to be the Groundhog Day cycle that we're in currently and if the Democrats take over my suspicion is that Muller will very soon thereafter issue a report to Congress that the Democrats will use as a basis for impeachment that's why the midterms are so important I do believe that if the Democrats take over Adam Schiff will be elected their speaker and that the most fundamental question they'll have to manage is the impeachment question and it will be bad for the country do you think how are you feeling about your chances well you know November's a long way away I feel great about the economy and I think that at the end of the day regular folks just want to know whether or not they have a reason to be more optimistic about their future I think that's what every election is about if people feel like their hopes and dreams are more in their grasp as a consequence of what's going on in the country I think they're likely to keep the current party in power if people feel like their dreams are diminished that they don't have opportunity they can't get that raise that new job their business can't grow then I think they vote for for a different group to come in and run the place right now I think you know all the data we see is that Americans more optimistic about their economic circumstances than at any point certainly since the early 2000s yeah no question about it congressman gates thank you very much a really interesting interview I hope you get what you're looking for I'd like to find out myself I think most of America would thank you if we get the documents we could come back and chat about them on your pocket please please do come back I appreciate it all right really interesting interview you know it's really funny whenever there's a Republican who's doing a good job the minute they see the stupid or evil so they were saying this is a big meme on the left that Gates is stupid and I was sitting there talking to him I thought yeah you can say something about it but you can't say he's stupid all right stuff I like obviously was somebody who works here or used to work here or works here for the next I thought say 20 seconds it dumped it's like it takes me to get that little all his Alex zingaro all right this sinner I you know I rarely I rarely binge anything because I don't have time but the thing I like about the sinner sinner Isis started on USA Network and then moved over to Netflix and so it's 45 minutes in episode and I found myself binging it and I actually watched I think I stopped them embarrassed to say this but one day when my wife went to bed early I think I watched four episodes and it's only like eight episodes you know it's it's a really entertaining crime drama it's it's based on a novel by Petra hummus far it's been a little bit it's it's dark I got to tell you it's a dark story it's apparently less dark than the novel which I haven't read the novel takes place in Germany this takes place in upstate New York Jessica Biel does an excellent job she's a she was the executive producer on and she's been trying to get you know these these pretty girls as they get older they have to work very hard to get good parts she's still very beautiful she turns in a terrific performance and the story is an ordinary wife and mom one day picks up a knife and just kills a guy slaughtered a guy at the beach and in plain sight in front of everybody and the question is not who did it it's why she did it here's the trailer where did you stab so the crown jewel of it as bill Pullman's performance as this very very neurotic cop who's kind of falling apart he's enslaved by this kind of dominatrix this is the new thing it used to be when they wanted to show that a guy was dark and had troubled he was a drunk but now he's got a dominatrix but he turns in a very I couldn't decide for a lot of the a lot of the show whether he was giving a mannered overwrought performance or he was just playing a guy who had a lot of mannerisms he couldn't look at people in the eye but I ultimately decided that it was a really a really good intense complex performance there was also another woman in it and I cannot find out I've had a hard time tracking down who who she is if I get her name I'll come back and and say it but she plays a cop a feminist cop and she's a horrible horrible human being and she gets this character just right and she's it is really good she's kind of a classic character who comes in from upstate and sort of tells the local cop what's what and doesn't know what she's talking about and she just really played this person so realistically anyway it's got good performances what I really liked as I know crimes fiction so well but I really like this as it got toward the end and as the explanation started to come clear it got very original they're stuffing that I'd never seen before some anti religious stuff that I thought was silly you know kind of a depiction of Catholicism that isn't true in America anymore may still be true in Germany or may just be an anti-catholic nonsense but still the plot was original the story was compelling the performances were excellent really fun episode but really fun show and it's coming back with a new story I don't know who the cast will be in the new story that's coming back in August with a new story and I will definitely be watching it the sinner all right I've I've delayed as long as I can I the Clavin this weekend is here disaster everywhere it's gonna look like one of those movies where things the word Martians come and
