1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
“It’s hard work and 
you still have to do it

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,540
all with a smile on your face.”

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,110
“I like the fast-paced
environment.”

4
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,324
“Before I bring anything to the 
table, it needs to be perfect.”

5
00:00:10,324 --> 00:00:11,490
“There’s never a dull moment.”

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,740
“Very physical, very raw.”

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,940
“There’s never enough money.

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,310
I’ll just say that. There’s
never enough money.”

9
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,090
“Three-fourths of my yearly
income come from tips.”

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,600
“I make $2.65 an
hour.”

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,320
“In New Jersey, I was making $2.13 
an hour.”

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,360
“$2.13 an hour.”

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,170
“$2.13.”

14
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,700
“So I don’t really per se
live off of paychecks as much

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,870
as I do tips.”

16
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:34,110
“I think tipping is great for
economy and small businesses.

17
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,490
You walk out with cash.”

18
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,500
“But if we don’t smile,
if we don’t look cute —

19
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,600
we don’t make good tips.”

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,310
“You hope you do good
enough to get at least 10 percent.”

21
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,830
“It’s always true when
you really need money,

22
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,980
you’re disenfranchised.”

23
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,680
“With men, you have to 
kind of be careful.

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,900
You can't be too sweet.
you can't be too, you know, serious.”

25
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,530
“He was flirting with me
heavily and he racked up

26
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,830
about a $70 tab.

27
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,520
And when I turned him
down for dinner and drinks,

28
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,680
he wrote a zero
in the tip line.”

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,840
“He grabbed me, pulled
me by my waist

30
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,300
and started trying
to kiss me on my neck and stuff.

31
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,950
And I'm pushing him
away.”

32
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,810
“But he kept talking about

33
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,250
wanting to bend me over 
and spank me.”

34
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,850
“He looked at me and said,
‘Would you ride me like a pony?’”

35
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,470
“I’ve never been
with a black girl.”

36
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,810
“I felt a hand go
underneath my dress.”

37
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,290
“He was asking me where I live.”

38
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,635
“I screamed to my manager, who

39
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:25,620
happened to be there,

40
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,160
‘Hey, that guy just touched me.’

41
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,630
Nothing happened.”

42
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,830
“Sex does sell.

43
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,960
You have to balance it out,

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,940
but still try to
keep your dignity.”

45
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,640
“Most of my day is
geared towards — how is

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,680
a man going to feel about me?

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,550
How can I maximize
tips without feeling

48
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,790
overly sexualized?
Between the hair and the makeup

49
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,315
and how much cleavage
do I want to show today?”

50
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:52,440
“You don’t want to look too
sexy, but you don’t also

51
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
want to look sexless.”

52
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,610
“And you must always
be aware of the balance.”

53
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,830
“It's a very thin line. Yep.”

54
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,200
“You know I'll put
up with some stuff

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
to get the tip.”

56
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,040
“You know the little, 
‘Ah, you’re so funny.’

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,350
That might be an extra
$5 right there.

58
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,699
Do I like doing that?

59
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,940
No.”

60
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,020
“At my job, I’m at now,

61
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,760
this whole thing is
going on, the #MeToo movement.

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,680
And I actually heard
a guy say, ‘I don’t

63
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,660
understand what the problem is.

64
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,920
Everybody wants sex.

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,390
Everybody's got to have sex.

66
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,920
What’s the problem with this?’”

67
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,600
“I had one guy, while I was
trying to lock up, come in

68
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,340
and say, ‘Well, are you
here by yourself?’

69
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,949
And I’m like, ‘no, no, no.

70
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:32,990
My cooks are in the back.’

71
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,870
He said, ‘No, I’ve been watching
you. There’s no one here.’

72
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,210
That’s when I went and got just
a little .38 Special revolver

73
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,160
that I kept in my
purse when I closed.”

74
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,460
“Well, it was my last table.

75
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,418
I did all my side work and I
was getting ready to go.

76
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:49,790
And I was leaving at
the same time he was.

77
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,960
We got to my car.

78
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,280
And I said, ‘Thank you so much.

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,030
You were so great.

80
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,980
And I appreciate it.’

81
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,190
And I go to reach for my door
and he blocks my door shut.

82
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,780
And it was terrifying.”

83
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,630
“You know and it’s not just
that you feel frightened.

84
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,130
You feel embarrassed.”

85
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,210
“It’s awful.

86
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:06,210
The degrading, it's disgusting.”

87
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,960
“And it made me angry.”

88
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,150
“On one hand, this
guy just violated me.

89
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,220
And on the other hand —”
“I needed the $20 tip.”

90
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,830
“You have to fight for your
tips because you can’t just say,

91
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,380
‘No, don't.’”

92
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,060
“I had really, really had it.”

93
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,060
“And I wanted to say —”

94
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,320
“I shouldn’t have

95
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,570
to take home less to my
child because some guy wasn’t

96
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,530
into me that day.”

97
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,150
“Smiling isn’t consent.”

98
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,000
“Don’t touch me.”

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,780
“Don’t touch me.”

100
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,470
“Don’t touch me.”

101
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,230
“No one needs to touch each other.”

102
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,320
“If I wanted to get hit on, I’d be
on the other side of the bar.

103
00:03:36,320 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.”
