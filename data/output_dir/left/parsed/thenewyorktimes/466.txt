Prince was a chameleonic,
flamboyant and at times
reclusive artist whose work
over 35 years spanned funk,
rock, R&B and pop.
He sold more than 100 million
records, won seven Grammys
and was inducted into the Rock
& Roll Hall of Fame in 2004,
stealing the spotlight from an
ensemble of musicians who were
otherwise his peers.
He died in April of 2016
at his own Paisley Park estate
in Minnesota, also home
to his personal performing
space and recording studio.
A virtuoso guitarist and
notoriously controlling
producer, Prince not only
sang lead and backup vocals
for many of his songs,
but he also performed most of
the instrumental tracks.
Though known for his top 10
hits such as
"Little Red Corvette,"
"When Doves Cry," and
"Let's Go Crazy,"
he sequenced them into a
elaborate high concept albums
such as "1999," 
"Sign of the Times"
and "Purple Rain,"
a fictionalized memoir of an
emerging biracial, spectacularly
ambitious, musician.
Its music sold more than
13 million copies in the U.S.
and won an Academy Award.
After a much publicized split
in 1996 with his record company,
Warner Brothers,
he became a pioneer of
alternative distribution, with
Internet downloads, live
streaming and subscriptions.
He had plenty of
eccentricities.
Among them his penchant for
releasing huge troves of music
at once and his famous fondness
for the color purple.
Yet among musicians and
listeners of multiple
generations he was admired
nearly universally.
