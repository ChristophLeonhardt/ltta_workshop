there's no question this election cycle has seen a bevy of radical media double standards Donald Trump's sexual harassment assault accusers they've been treated as headline news allegations about intimidation of sexual harassment assault victims by Hillary Clinton those have been utterly ignored trumpian bigotry against a suah so-called Mexican judge dominated the news cycle for weeks Clinton connected bigotry against Catholics went completely unnoticed we heard for a full week about a Miss Universe contestant Trump allegedly called Miss Piggy back in 1997 when I was 13 years old we've heard very little about Hillary Clinton's perverse dealings with the media and the FBI we've heard for months about Trump's toxic impact on politics we've had precious seat and precious few headlines about the firebombing of a GOP campaign headquarters in North Carolina or shattered windows at other GOP operations or the repeated violent attempts to disrupt Trump rallies or hurt Trump fans part of this is the allure of novelty from sanh new figure in politics every bit of information now hitting the newsstands seems fresh meanwhile Hillary's been in the politics for decades which means every allegation of corruption and nastiness nearly reinforces general perceptions about her but there's something else afoot here most Americans simply expect Democrats to act like Hillary Clinton and to get away with it take for example the new allegations by James O'Keefe that Clinton associated parties are involved in promoting voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies keeps project Vera's house once undercover with a Democratic operative who openly admitted to encouraging people to rent cars in order to derive to precincts and vote illegally you use shells said the operative use shell companies cars come in from one company the paychecks come from another there's no bus involved so you can't prove it's on mass so it doesn't tip people off unquote the operative also admitted to attempting to provoke violence at Trump events quote you put people in the line at the front of the line which means they have to get there at 6:00 in the morning because they have to get in front of the rally so when Trump comes down the rope line they're the ones asking him the question in front of the reporter because they're pre placed there the activists admitted a 69 year-old woman supposedly beaten up by a trump supporter was actually working for him that event generated major national headlines at the time quote arrest warrants issued an assault of 69 year-old female protester at North Carolina Trump rally blared the Washington Post 69 year old says she was cold-cocked by Trump supporters during protests at midnight video shows aftermath of a 69 year-old woman punched at a trump rally reported the LA Times none of this seems to rate national attention however as that 69 year old woman Shirley Teeter appeared on national is anytime this week after these revelations apparently not how about the firebombing of the Trump offices nope and when's the next time Hillary will be asked about her position on voter ID now that it appears some associated with her campaign have been deliberately flouting voting law now some of this is due to the media's leftism but a good deal of it is due to the fact that corruption regularized over time simply becomes background noise nobody expects anything from Democrats Americans have accepted the Democratic Party as the party of voter fraud and political violence since the 1960s they've accepted Hillary Clinton as the candidate of manipulation and corruption since in the 1990s democratic evils are normal Republican evils are an ever-present source of news and interest which is terrible for the country all corruption should be shocking the fact it isn't helps explain why the 2016 election has become a competition in pursuing new lows the old lows just don't seem to register anymore i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro

lyft is the one that I use okay so last night was the was the third and final debate the apocalypse is finally coming close to an end where we're approaching the end of this routine and here are some basic overall thoughts on the debate number one everybody sort of gets graded on their own terms as I've said Trump gets graded along trumpian terms Hillary gets graded along Hillary terms if we were to have an objective standard of quality Trump sucked and so did Hillary any objective standard they were both garbage Hillary's a liar Hillary's robotic every so often Hillary breaks into her evil clown from the woods grin which means that you know that she's lying Trump implodes on a frequent basis because he's a ticking time bomb he's sort of like a piece of aluminum he put in the microwave and every so often the thing just fries yeah that's that's Trump in debate he doesn't know what he's talking about Hillary also doesn't know what she's talking about but she but she is sort of mechanical in the way she doesn't know what she's talking about so it's a fight between two awful awful human beings I would say that the Trump won the first third of the debate second third of the debate Trump sort of collapsed over Putin and final third of the debate the only thing that matters is the controversy that's dominating the headlines today this is totally driven by trumpets Trump sewn fault all of the headlines last night and this morning are about Trump saying that he's not going to accept the results of the election or that he may not accept the results of the election the only reason that was even asked to him is because he spent the last week talking about how the election is rigged and the reason he spent the last week talking about how the election is rigged is because he knows he's going to lose at this point and he's trying to convince people the reason he's going to lose is because of the media and it's because of voter fraud and it's because of never Trump and so therefore in order to fight all those people he'll need $10 a month from you for Trump TV and we will get to the fact that Donald Trump essentially launched Trump TV in the middle of the debate last night seriously like online he launched Trump TV the slogan is hair and unbalanced so it's that that's actually gonna be a thing but the debate itself I was slightly surprised by the debate number one I thought Trump performed better than I expected him to that's number one I thought that he actually had some good points to make he always makes them awkwardly but he made some good points I thought that he had a couple attacks on Hillary Clinton that were effective I thought Chris Wallace the modern was spectacular I thought that most of the effective attacks on Hillary Clinton were actually pushed by Chris Wallace and then from followed in his wake because Chris Wallace was asking decent significant questions of both candidates it was it was surprising me that Trump didn't completely blow up I was expecting him as you know from yesterday's podcast to turn into debate performance where he dropped Bill Clinton's illegitimate kid or alleged illegitimate kid and went after Hillary Clinton with National Enquirer rumors that may still happen as we enter the last couple weeks of the of the election cycle but he didn't do it last night and that helps shore up the sort of fading Republican base that is not enthused about him so that's smart of him I don't think it won him any new voters I don't think it want her any new voters but it's worthy of examination because whenever we look at these debates it's worthy of examining what should have been said what could have been said and where people are fibbing because I think the truth and facts still matter even though we're living in a post truth post factual era so let's begin it starts off last night and Hillary Clinton says that she's asked about the Supreme Court and here is Hillary Clinton's awful awful evil take on what the Supreme Court is supposed to do we stand up and basically say the Supreme Court should represent all of us that's how I see the court and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans this perspective on the court is actually evil the judicial branch is not designed to quote-unquote stand up to the powerful it's not designed to be in the great tradition of representing all Americans it's not a representative body that's the point of having people appointed for life the idea for the Supreme Court is it represents the Constitution not the people you want a representative body you look to Congress you want a representative of the people you look to these two crap shows on your screen but if you actually want a big group of people who are supposed to stand up for the Constitution that's what the Supreme Court theoretically was for you know I wrote a whole paper I've been trying to get up folks I get a lot of questions about this I've been trying to dig up my paper from Law School where I talked about why Marbury vs. Madison was a perversion of the constitutional structure but you know the idea at least in theory is the Supreme Court is supposed to stand up for the text of the Constitution it's actually what she's saying her and I say it's evil when she says that the courts are supposed to be sort of a super moral legislature standing above us and dictating what's good and bad that's nasty and it's evil and when she says that the job of the courts is to stand up to the powerful that's actually immoral okay the job of the courts is to do justice it's not to slap down people because they're powerful sometimes powerful people are right sometimes they're wrong it's not their job to to be Marxist tree distributors of justice so what she's saying here is really quite terrible Trump gives a pretty good answer by contrast down the Supreme Court the Supreme Court it's what it's all about our country is so so it's just so imperative that we have the right justices something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people many many millions of people that I represent and she was forced to apologize and apologize she did but these were statements that should never ever have been made we need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment and all amendments but the Second Amendment which is under absolute siege so eventually he got around to saying that he would appoint somebody who would actually interpret the Constitution according to the founders meaning which is the proper answer but not until he gets off his chest that he's mad at Ruth Bader Ginsburg for saying mean things about him because this is who our candidates are because this entire can this entire campaign has just been a series of Groundhog Day suicide attempts by the American people I mean it's just like we're all jumping in the bathtub and lighting that toaster and tossing it it okay so Hillary Clinton is a congenital liar so she's decided to lie about the second amendment at that point here's what she said about the Heller vs. DC decision and you mentioned the Heller decision and what I was saying that you referenced Kris was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them and the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation but they've accepted many others so I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment I make fact-check a bunch of crap it's a hundred and ten page decision the hello vs. DC decision and never once mentions toddlers the entire decision is about the that individuals do have the right to keep and bear arms and that you can't force somebody to lock up a gun in their own home and the person who actually filed the lawsuit in DC vs. Heller was a 66 year old retired policeman not a guy with a toddler so she's just making things up now because it's convenient for her politically now what have been nice is if we had a nominee who knew that unfortunately we have a nominee who barely knows how to spell his own name so here was Donald Trump's rebuttal of this well the DC versus Heller decision was very strongly and she was extremely angry about it I watched when she was very very angry when upheld and Justice Scalia was so involved and it was a well crafted decision but Hillary was extremely upset extremely angry and people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say just as upset and angry over and over and over and we're supposed to think that's a wonderful response this is the problem it was really depressing if we had a candidate who could string together a paragraph that made sense Hillary would have been not only on the ropes should have been knocked clean through the ropes in all three of these debates she's in she can't defend herself every attack on her is a good attack and you'll see I mean at a certain point in this debate you'll see that she starts grinning like a crazy person and that's the hotel hotel is when she starts grinning like the evil clown who's emerging from the woods to kill a small child and eat it that's when you know that she's being hit with something that's accurate but I mean that death glare that she's got on her face right here that was her other look of the evening so they move on from guns and the next thing they do is they start talking about abortion so first Chris Wallace has to bully Trump into saying that he'll overturn roe v wade now a lot of people today were saying that trumps answers on abortion were just the high points of this debate they're the high point of Trump's candidacy I didn't think so the reason I didn't think so is cuz I actually care about the issue of abortion an awful lot as you may have noticed and he no never at any time that I can remember did him as a moderator ever asked a Democrat about partial-birth abortion Chris Wallace actually did and Trump didn't do a very good job of slamming her over it it was it was pretty weak t it also doesn't help the Donald Trump has a very weak pro-life record over the last 15 years he went from yes partial-birth abortion should be legal to we should punish women for abortion he doesn't know anything about the issue and and that was obvious here even his answer here was very weak on abortion here's chris wallace talking about we wait do you want the court including the justices that you will name to overturn roe v wade which includes in fact states a woman's right to abortion well if that would happen because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges I would think that that will go back to the individual states but I'm asking you specifically would you like they overturned it'll go back to the states but what I'm asking you sir is do you want to see the court overturn you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment do you want to see the court overturn we put another two or perhaps three justices on that's really what's going to be had that's will happen and that'll happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court I will say this it will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination okay for people who actually care about things like pro-life it'll go back to the states is not a good answer okay I don't want States green-lighting late-term abortion either he's right that's what roe v wade does but that's not the question right the proper answer here is roe v wade is a moral and legal abomination i will appoint justices who will overturn it on the grounds that the Constitution never guarantees anybody's right to kill a child in the womb end of story end of story but that wasn't Trump's answer we'll get to Hillary's answer in just a minute but first we have a new advertiser hints water is fantastic stuff so hint water if you are is somebody who despises the taste of water I have a two and a half year old daughter she really really doesn't like water it bores her it bores most people for a long time we were for a long time we were using sparkling water that didn't do it hint water is great it has kind of this this taste of other taste that you they infuse natural flavors into the water it's not sugar it's it's additional flavor they have pineapple and watermelon Crisp Apple and Blackberry I've tried it it's fantastic it tastes great we down pints of the stuff it's very healthy and it's really good for you and right now if you go to hint calm h int calm slash Ben you get a variety pack shipped directly to your door that's three bottles of each of those four flavors I just mentioned those are the most popular pineapple watermelon Crisp Apple and Blackberry normally that's $24 now it's just fifteen bucks at drink hints.com slash Brennan's drink hint com slash Ben make sure use the /bin so that you get that that extra deal and I can tell you the water tastes great i mean hint water is really phenomenal stuff it's healthy and as i say i only put the the best food and drink into my kids and and i wouldn't give her hint if i didn't think that it was both great for her and great tasting she loves it she loves hint water so it's drink hint calm slash been by the way health and self magazines have named it the best flavored water that's on the market and i can attest that i've tried pretty much all of them and hint water is the best okay so Hillary Clinton was asked about partial birth abortion here's Hillary Clinton saying something deeply wrong and evil because she's a Democrat and that's what a lot of Democrats do you have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights you also voted against a ban on late term partial birth abortions why because roe v wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account and when i voted as a senator i did not think that that was the case the kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking painful decisions for families to make i have met those along these lines talking about these are heartbreaking painful decisions i'm sorry but when you kill a baby at term that is not a heartbreaking painful decision that is an act of moral cowardice and evil hey you can't define away babies i've seen two of them born at term and i've seen both my kids and it is a miracle and those are babies i mean they come out and those are human beings and that's what trump should say instead what trump says is something that's just it doesn't mean anything like it's evocative language but it doesn't mean anything because he doesn't know enough to say it people were praising this last night if you have one opportunity to make the pro-life argument on late term abortion and this is the best you can do it's not a good answer because it because of what hillary clinton replies I mean this is here here it is mr. Trump your reaction particularly on this issue of late term partial birth well I think it's there if you go with what Hillary is saying in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby now you can say that that's okay and Hillary can say that that's okay but it's not okay with me because based on what she's saying and based on where she's going and where she's been you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day and that's not acceptable well Hillary responds this way well that is not what happens in these cases and using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate you should meet with some of the women that I've met with women I've known over the course of my life this is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make and I do not believe the government should be making it okay again this is this is the fact that Trump was not able to make the moral case here in stronger language actually it makes my stomach hurt it's it's it's I mean she's making a moral argument that is a difficult decision for women the government shouldn't be involved how can he not say at any time this is a fully-formed child and you're talking about redefining it is not human simply so that you can kill it that's not about making a difficult decision that's about denying the reality of a human beings life for whatever reason you seek and it doesn't matter what your reasons are once you're talking about taking a baby and pulling it by the feet into the birth canal listen what partial birth abortion is and then jabbing a scissors into its skull jabbing a hole up there and then sucking its brains out because you want to pretend that that's not a child and we know that that is a child if you want to do that and say that that's okay that is an act of deep moral evil it's it's disgusting and for you to sit there and pretend that there's a write in the Constitution of the United States to do that simply because you're a woman or simply because you feel like it is denying the humanity of the other and you say that you want to protect people why don't you start with the most innocent people there are babies that are in the womb why don't you start there you know for him not to be able to say that again that's not a complex argument that's something I think that you could say instead he talks about the graphic nature he take the bait and rip the baby out of the womb he's not even talking about killing the baby right I mean like when he says take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb you could be talking about a c-section for God's sake it's just it's it's stupid language and again it's it's a blown opportunity and I feel like this entire election is a blown opportunity it's really it's really just it makes you a little bit it makes me very upset I mean if this had been a debate with anybody with the capacity to make these arguments Hillary would didn't toast and and it wasn't it's just it's very upsetting but that was not the high point or the low point for Trump we will get back to that Trump had some good points he had some some not so good points we'll get to the real headline of the day over at Daily wire comm subscribe now and you get a free copy of my book true allegiance signed and and you also get to watch the rest of this live you get to be part of the mailbag today we're doing the mailbag today taking live questions is daily wire calm which is all very exciting and you get Andrew clavin's podcasts live as well you get to be part of his mailbag so lots going on a daily wire.com new services being added all the time for the subscribers treat yourself become a subscriber daily wire calm and so you can continue listening and watching to the Ben Shapiro show right here
