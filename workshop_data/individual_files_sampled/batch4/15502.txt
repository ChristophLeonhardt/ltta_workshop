cristiano phobia is hot and Islamophobia is not I'm going to bring you the tale of the state broadcaster and their treatment of two different religions the BBC's the social describes itself on its YouTube page as the best of Scotland's music comedy-drama lifestyle Sport and everything in between now they made big promises to me that they'll bring me must watch videos daily and that I should be prepared to be surprised shocked and amazed and on their YouTube page BBC's the social posted a video titled the time for love it's about homophobia in 2018 and in that short video produced by the BBC they have some not so closeted anti-catholic bigotry just watch this from the United Kingdom's state broadcaster here like her poem line wrapped off many tailors and sell them on as Jesus save it easy because it seems to me like Jesus saved a lot a time when he died for all our claims they would have wasted teaching small mains and love is no safe sea hem thinks it's faithful and a slight cardboards and it smells like hay so BBC has no problem calling Christianity hateful saying that the Catholic Eucharist tastes like hate okay fine I'm not gonna blow anything up over it but let's compare and contrast this with the BBC's treatment of anyone who publicly expresses criticism for Islam look at this tweet from 2016 this is a BBC reporter named Katrin Nye she says a man interrupted an interview that she was doing about Islamophobia with Islamophobia she said this was part of a news story that she was doing on rising Twitter abuse now I want you to see the clip that this reporter attached to her tweet just watch the point now where I don't really think that me condemning these kind of attacks are going to change people's opinions so if you've got something to say that you can say it do you want to talk about Sharia law you want to talk about Sharia law to me and we can talk about we'll talk about Sharia law you obviously said it for a reason I wasn't I wasn't talking to you yeah who were you talking to who are you talking to you about Sharia law here sir what we losing our right to freedom of expression and I feel is that which we are we are we've been we've been told to be politically correct when we we don't want to be pretty completely so that man expressed criticism for Islam he didn't call it hateful he didn't say oh I don't know halal meat tastes like cardboard and hate no he just expressed concern and disagreement with the religious and political ideology that's not really hate is it now the woman in the video wearing the hijab actually goes on to berate that man for quite some time and then BBC posted that video on their YouTube page as evidence of Islamophobia instead of evidence of a poorly behaved woman in a head job who can't deal with someone with different ideas than herself it was weird so that's Islamic phobia there but that bizarre anti-catholic BBC video was I don't know tolerance I guess oh but there's no double standard now is there despite what the BBC has promised me I assure you that I am not amazed I am not surprised and I'm not even remotely shocked that this is the treatment the BBC would give Christianity it's not edgy it's not brave it's expected it's completely safe and it is attacking the low-hanging fruit us Christians do this thing called turning the other cheek I'm not mad I'm making a snarky video I'm Catholic I guess I'm supposed to find this video offensive but I really don't I just find it sort of dull and lazy and as a conservative I don't feel like there are any religions or ideologies that are off-limits for discussion or scrutiny or criticism especially my own I'm pretty confident in what I believe in I believe it to be true and right so I'm happy to have those discussions and I can defend my positions with other people and I don't need cristiano phobia laws to protect me and bully my critics into silence for the rebel media I'm Shiela gonna read what you just saw there is my daily video here at the rebel but I also have my own full-length show where I talk a lot about issues of anti-christian bigotry in education and in government but to get access to my show and the rest of our amazing premium content you have to become a rebel subscriber today you
