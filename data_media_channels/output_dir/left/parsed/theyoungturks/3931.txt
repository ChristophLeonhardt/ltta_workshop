A MAYORAL CANDIDATE IN
CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA POSTED
ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHE IS WHITE
AS ONE OF HER TOP QUALIFICATIONS
FOR GETTING ELECTED.
LUCKILY,
SHE IS PRETTY LOW IN THE POLLS
AND IS NOT LIKELY TO GET
ELECTED, BUT HERE IS KIMBERLY
PAIGE BARNETTE.
SHE SAID THIS ON
FACEBOOK.
APPARENTLY NOT SMART
ENOUGH TO KNOW GRAMMAR BUT
THAT'S OKAY.
SHE THINKS BEING
WHITE IS ON THE TOP
QUALIFICATIONS THAT SHE HAS.
SHE ALSO MADE SOME STATEMENTS IN
REGARD TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS
LIVING IN CHARLOTTE WHO MIGHT
NEED SOME HELP AND SHE SAID:
YOU KIND OF GET A SENSE OF WHAT
KIND OF PERSON KIMBERLY IS.
THAT IS A VERY SOPHISTICATED
LINE OF THINKING.
I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT.
SHE IS SMART AND WHITE.
WELL, THAT IS A TWO FOR.
THE NORTH CAROLINA GOP
RELEASED A STATEMENT CONDEMNING
HER BUT EVEN IN THEIR STATEMENT
CONDEMNING HER, THEY COULDN'T
HELP IT GET POLITICAL AND PLACE
BLAME ON A DEMOCRAT IN THAT
STATE.
LET'S HEAR FROM ROBIN
HAYES WHO IS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE
NORTH CAROLINA GOP.
THAT PORTION OF THE STATEMENT
IS FINE AND THEN IT CONTINUES ON
WITH:
WHAT 
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
YOU
ARE MAKING A STATEMENT IN REGARD
TO SOMETHING DISGUSTING THAT A
MAYORAL CANDIDATE THAT IS
REPUBLICAN MADE.
JUST LEAVE IT
AT THAT.
LEAVE THE POLITICS OUT
OF IT.
I GET IT, YOU WANT TO
JAB THE DEMOCRAT BUT THE
DEMOCRAT IN THIS CASE DIDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE
STATEMENT THAT THE REPUBLICAN
MADE ON HER'S FACEBOOK PAGE.
LETTER TO CONDEMN THAT AND MOVE
ON?.
I WAS GOING TO GIVE THE NORTH
CAROLINA GOP CREDIT, AT LEAST
THEY ARE DISOWNING HER AND
SAYING IT'S THE WRONG THING TO
SAY.
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS
DUE.
SHE DOESN'T SPEAK FOR ALL
REPUBLICANS.
BUT THEY CANNOT
HELP THEMSELVES.
THAT PERSON
MIGHT BE RACIST, BUT WE REALLY
HAD THE DEMOCRATIC MAYOR.
JUST
DO THAT AND ANOTHER PRESS
RELEASE.
WE GET IT THAT YOU ARE
RUNNING AGAINST HIM.
THAT'S
TOTALLY FINE.
YOU'LL HAVE TO
DISARM FOR THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN,
JUST SIMPLE.
DOPE WHEN I ERASE
BY RUNNING.
THAT'S IT.
BUT SHE
IS NOT VERY SMART.
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN SELL.
I THOUGHT FOR
A SECOND THAT MAYBE SHE DIDN'T
MEAN IT BUT THEN YOU THINK ABOUT
IT, SHE PUT WHITE, TRADITIONAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE MEANT.
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS THE STATE
OF SOME FOLKS IN THE GOP THESE
DAYS.
