well the good die young and Cuban dictator Fidel Castro has passed away at ninety all across Cuba people prepared for a seven day period of pretending to mourn while sniggering quietly and hoping no one killed them for it while the thousands of people who risk their lives to escape Cuba celebrated Castro's death all the people who risk their lives to go live in Cuba were sorry to see him go across the u.s. journalists and other Democrats honored Castro in grief-stricken statements intended to comfort the nation with the comic relief of their moral stupidity as one sobbing American college student put it quote I was so upset by the election of Donald Trump but now I see that the people condemning Trump are also praising Castro so maybe they're just knuckleheads and Trump is actually okay unquote NBC's Andrea Mitchell marked Castro's passing by saying quote even though he murdered thousands and enslaved an entire nation he gave Cuba universal health care so that even those who opposed him could walk right into a hospital and have the bullets removed from their brains Brian Williams who has a job at MSNBC for some reason said quote I remember when Fidel and I were fighting in the Cuban jungle together and we ran into a patrol of Batista's orcs who were trying to conquer Narnia and join forces with Voldemort that was the moment when I saw Castro was truly a great man unquote the New York Times a former newspaper published an obituary saying quote some people saw Fidel as a murderous dictator but some saw him as a fiery romantic revolutionary with enormous sex appeal who sometimes they would fantasize about having sex with in a thrillingly submissive way before dreaming they could hand the entire American government into his excitingly masculine and powerful hands so they could be submissive to him all the time but that's just some people unquote among world leaders soon-to-be former failed President Barack Obama issued a statement saying many in Cuba today are receiving the hearts and minds of those across America who whether they are rich or poor are looking to the hopes and dreams of an entire in the sunrise of its most opulent crescendos and told the statement to make any sense Obama bought himself another whiskey and muttered what difference does it make I've accomplished nothing and my life is a meaningless joke leave me the hell alone Canada's Prime Minister just came under heavy criticism for issuing a statement praising Castro Trudeau struck back at his critics saying quote hey maybe if you like the way you look so much oh baby you should go and love yourself unquote possibly that was Justin Bieber but who can say Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi made the wisest and most intelligent statements about Castro's death and another news a cow gave birth to a two-headed human child Castro's ashes will be buried beside those of other famous Cubans he will then proceed to the throne of God where in recognition of a lifetime of almost unimaginable brutality and evil he will be condemned to spend eternity in Castro's Cuba trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show really we like this so much we're doing it twice it's alright are we on finally yes all right so we're today we're asking the philosophical question if Fidel Castro has a Clavin this weekend is it a Clavin this weekend I mean that's that is because it certainly was from Fidel welcome back I hope you all had a nice Thanksgiving I returned to you a wiser but fatter man I think I must I did not I didn't nothing for four days but eat and drink that's all I did and argue with liberals and and make myself feel bad about the fact that I have no patience for liberals anymore right now I have to you know after walk around going oh I wish I were nicer to the Bulls you know but I'm not so it doesn't matter all right we're gonna be talking more about Fidel Castro with our Nobel Prize winning cultural correspondent Michael Knowles I gave him the Nobel Prize because I figure if they're giving it to Bob Dylan and Barack Obama no longer means anything so why can't I just give them we're gonna pipe him in here by our math miraculous technology before that let me just remind you that my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ is on sale as an e-book for three more days til the end of the month it you can get it for $2.99 but really what you should do is get the hardcover and give it to your friends for Christmas because it makes an excellent Christmas present all right nulls can we bring in all sweet chopper him in here and come in there it is coming directly from the jungles of Cuba or possibly the desk next to mine I'm not sure so so I I wanted to bring you on right away because I wanted to talk about first of all the reaction to Castro's death I mean this is a guy the almost 60 years enslaved this island he murdered you know they have this thing called the the Cuban archive where they're trying to name all the people that he assassinated I mean by firing squad and tortured and all this stuff they're up til over 9,000 now just just naming them just you know and the work is gonna be going on so this is a really here is Obama's I was making fun of this but here is a selection of Obama's statement about the death of Fidel Castro at this time of Fidel Castro's passing we extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people we know that this moment fills Cubans in Cuba and in the United States with powerful emotions recalling the countless ways in which Fidel Castro altered the course of individual lives families and of the Cuban nation a bullet to the head will alter the your life no question history will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him today we offer condolences to Fidel Castro's family and our thoughts and prayers are with the Cuban people in the days ahead they will recall the past and also look to the future as one does as they do the Cuban people must know that they have a friend and partner in the United States of America this is I mean it's amazing stuff can I just leave it and and you know I mean Trump Trump's the Trump's credit he's just said this was an evil dictator and you know good riddance just think of that statement Donald Trump has more moral clarity than any worldly Nancy Pelosi was the same but I mean you know how hard it was I mean this stuff that the press was saying was unbelievable I mean did you hear their reactions I you know I don't want to bring us back to the last segment that we did on Wednesday but there was a lot of fake news going around you know actually before we get I do think we shouldn't skip over Justin Trudeau's statement just just listen to the real one it is with deep sorrow that I learned today of the death of Cuba's longest-serving president Fidel Castro was a larger-than-life leader who served his people for almost half a century a legendary revolutionary and orator mr. Castro made significant improvement to education and healthcare no didn't of his island nation while a controversial figure both mr. Castro's supporters and detractors recognized his tremendous dedication and for the Cuban people no we don't have a deep and lasting affection for El comandante eh I can't go on it gets worse I just can't keep this is this is amazing let's go back let us talk a little bit about who this guy was in the history of this guy he I mean did in all fairness before Castro they were Cuba was under the heels of a dictator Batista right so that so that's where we start yeah that's right Cuba was under the heels of this obvious tyrant Fulgencio Batista a lot of people in their reactions are saying that we can't criticize Castro because the United States had a relationship with Batista which doesn't make any sense to me yeah but also there is there is a moral distinction here between a murderous tyrant who's an ally of the United States and a murderous tyrant who brings Soviet missiles into the Western Hemisphere on us to nuclear war so so cute so Castro comes to power Castro comes to power you know what's interesting is Castro actually tried to come to power about six years earlier than he did in 1953 he staged what he was hoping to be a revolution and was arrested by Batista thrown in jail for a few years and then eventually exiled he was allowed to go away to Mexico and start planning another revolution with his brother role and with Che Guevara of t-shirt Fame that's right and then he came back to Cuba and overthrew the government so you would this seems to happen a lot in dictatorships when these commies come to Hitler with the push and they put them away and they kind of seasons them and in prison and they come back all the stronger yeah that's right yes so I you know you think they would learn their lesson but Fidel comes to power 1959 he is 12 weeks later takes a trip to the United States says he has no interest in communism you know goes around to Georgetown University I think a few places makes nice with Americans and then within two years has ballistic missiles from the Soviet Union in Cuba almost launching the entire world into a full-scale nuclear war you know I can there's one of my earliest memories I can remember my father sitting watching TV saying like this is the to the world for all gonna die a smug my father was a very calm guy by all reports Fidel Castro was pleading with the Soviet Union to fire the missiles this is not and the tragic thing was you know we tried to get him out of there at the Bay of Pigs you know Eisenhower basically had set up this invasion where they were gonna send over the CIA say CIA backed rebels basically we're gonna go over and then Kennedy really got cold feet because they thought they thought like Dick Cheney the the Cubans were gonna rise up and throw off their chains you know and that didn't happen and Kennedy just thought like I want this to be a secret so I don't want to give them the air support they need that's right then was a fiasco that didn't stop us though from an estimated 9 to 16 CIA attempts to assassinate Castro and possible 600 attempts over the course of his life including certain ideas there were a couple really every cigar yeah there was going to be one where submarines fired lights over Cuba to make the Cubans believe that it was the second coming of Christ and revolt against the communists that's always works that always works that one has worked a million times that's right and the thing that gets me about this a lot of these statements like the one you read from Trudeau celebrated how long he was in power and they would say like he he stymied what was a six or seven American presidents that's not a good thing to have a guy in power that long you know that's a bad thing it actually was ten presidencies that he was officially in power and then obviously you know he stepped down in 2008 officially something tells me he's still wielded a bit of influence to implement the current President Raul Castro but why is that like a good thing that a guys in power for 60 years it's a bet that's what we call a dictatorship right that's right but it's so efficient you know let's get to this thing about this is what everybody's saying oh the health care and the and the universal health care and education he raised literacy that's right it's true I'll just read you a couple lines from the fake news okay yeah Andrea Mitchell said that he gave his people better health care and education and will be revered for the education and social service I'm here for all of his people that woman like you could you could shout in her ear and it would echo Jim a villa at CNN said that even Castro's critics praised his advances in health care and education I don't know which critics he does I didn't get a call and Castro was considered even to this day the George Washington of his country among those who remain in Cuba now again I don't know how many of those who remain in Cuba Jim was able to talk to but every single person who left Cuba including Castro's daughter seems to disagree with first of all that was twenty percent of the country left twenty percent of the country tried to escape tried to escape and of course you know they died they were dying and they were being eaten by sharks Castro was ramming their boats these poor rafts that they were trying to escape he was having the Coast Guard rammed their boats said there was nobody as Bill Whittle as fond of our pal bill will was fond of pointing out nobody was ruined their their inner tube in the other direction from Miami yeah I mean either smashers really summed up the left's feeling on Castro in this way says Fidel Castro was a romantic figure when he came into power we routed like mad for the guy and he was almost like a folk hero to most of us that's amazing and you know I will give Chris Matthews credit for being honest yes because I think a lot of left wingers will tell you that privately and you know they're the the buttheads Castro was a terrible guy but but as for health care and education okay it is true Cuba has one of the best health care systems in the world but it isn't for Cubans you can't use it there are about three health care systems in Cuba there is medical tourism which is very popular these are usually cosmetic surgeries Botox that's sort of so people from here can go over there you mean that's right people anyone who have hard currency like to pay the cash yeah to keep priming their economy right so that exists there's another health care system for party members and VIPs that is also ranked pretty well you know there were a lot of doctors the Cuba exports to kind of make a show of things then there's the third health care system which is for Cubans the the situation is so deplorable tomorrow word from yet former Secretary of State it is so deplorable that people have to bring their own bed sheets towels toilet paper and pillows when they go to these hospitals this is this is drives me crazy that and this is Michael Moore made a film about how wonderful it all is because this is you know this is what communism and socialism always what creates two tears it always creates it's it makes everybody equal except for the people in power I mean Castro was worth like a billion dollars I mean he was well he was a filthy rich guy and was living this life of women and mansions and all the stuff of course while people start you know when he took Batista was a dictator when he took over Cuba Cuba was one of the best one of the had one of the best economies right in the the Latin world and now if you look at Havana looks like a bomb that's it well what what I don't understand the one myth everyone keeps talking about is the great education literacy yeah in Cuba yeah and literacy and everything the University of Havana which is the University in Cuba is is not even ranked in the top thousand colleges and universities in the world it's it's ranked number seventeen hundred or something like that below yeah tiny universities in Africa and some of the poorer parts of the world it's not even in the top 20 universities in the Caribbean so I really don't know what I mean and this is a pretty recent study from Spain superior Council of scientific research I don't really know where they get any of these numbers from other than the old Chris Matthew fever dream and they and they come from Castro I mean this one has big things that all these numbers about their their health care all right well thank you very much our Nobel Prize winning cultural correspondent Michael you're my surprise
