like most Americans my wife loves law and order well the other day she stumble across the latest episode and said Ben he gotta check this out and boy was I in for a surprise I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood now there are a few things in this particular episode that are more than just a little bit problematic but first you have to start off with what law and order starts off with it's a very first frame at the very GetGo it says quote the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or event unquote well let's get into the story and why this stirred up so much controversy even before the opening frame begins the title of this particular episode is Infowars you might recognize that from being a concern of crazy news outlets and the opening sequence a conservative speaker is speaking on a college campus talking about statutes being torn down she is attacked and raped now this fictional conservative speakers name is Martha Cobb she's a beautiful blonde wearing red Infowars currently has a public speaker and reporter working for them who is also a beautiful blonde who often wears red who has also been attacked by nt4 members in the past you can see how this might be a little bit problematic people also point out that she could be a mere copy of an cult or because the way your character is successful when her book tours and very popular and charismatic as well as saying some really inflammatory things that infuriate people in the left now moving on now this event gets complicated because at this sanctioned speaking event they have some conservative people that bring in the right wing speaker and they're they're cheering and looking very very annoying with their make America great again hats channels kind of crazy stuff there's also a resistance of peaceful protesters who want to save space on campus that also have a antifa members and black bloc these people bring clubs they attack the event beat up everybody it's a really nasty thing stop me if you heard that story before anyway they tracked down the antifa member and he is almost a mirror image of Eric Clanton you might remember Eric Clanton as the bike lock assassin from the Berkeley riots this former student professor of ethics attacked a peaceful protest robe man with a bike lock and he is currently going to court right now for these assault charges you looks almost exactly like anyway at the coffee shop but of course he works that he ends up spewing a whole bunch of dribble about how there's always white supremacists trying to create genocide in the country we got a fight fascist and bring down the established order he will literally give you every single talking point you'll ever hear on YouTube of every left-wing auntie of a speaker that talks against these people he ends up laughing off the fact that this poor woman was assaulted and raped and then they take him in for questioning however did he do it we don't know because now there's a new person on the block videos release of a right-wing extremist who started a known terrorist organization called Patriots for the American Way he holds up a gun says some misogynistic racist stuff on this video and so they start tracking him now I keep him on every single character is unbearable on screen like they're all awful to listen to but particularly the right-wing people like I would like to fight any of these people they bring him to the cops and he's very confrontational rude and misogynist and awful and racist and he keeps talking about how his slogan is he's got to make America great again like clearly making that comparison to the Republican Party and trumping everything going on right now now it's important to note through all this the police are supposed to be neutral they're supposed to be the voices of reason right in the middle and from the very GetGo they completely disagree with everything the right-wing people are saying oh my gosh they're trying to take out the dreamers they don't want immigration they want to shut down Planned Parenthood all these kind of things and they're clearly leaning left that's totally fine but you can see like where they're trying to skew this anyway this whole thing finally goes to court and now it's up to you to decide like where is the truth so the antifa member openly talks about yes maybe I did rump there and yes I did assault her actually but I didn't rape her so this guy's clearly criminal but did he do it well they bring the racist kid onstage and he says some most awful stuff you've ever seen on TV even pointing out all the black people and women in the audience saying you should get out you should get out you should get out and even calls up this Jewish gay guy in the back is like yeah you can get out too anyway these lawyers and police officers I've dealt with terrible people in the past rapists murderers killers all kinds of stuff it turns out this guy is just so polarizing in so racist that they have to throw out the entire case there's no way they can get a fair trial because this guy's beliefs and views are just too nasty to do have any justice in court and the victim of the entire story who is the woman who was raped but she's you know a conservative talking pundit never gets justice never finds out who her rapist is and the whole thing is lost in the air and you never really care about the victim anyway because the way they portray her the first problem is what they chose that was actual in the stuff that was made up and fictionalized so the victims and the title are based on some real things as well as the different people in the left these are all real actual events you can see on YouTube all its kind of stuff every single talking point that you see on the left i've heard people like this the different antifa rallies say the exact same things about bringing down the fascism and stopping the genocide of these white people trying to destroy every minority and all my stuff and they'll write like I said you have the victims they even say real people like Rudy Giuliani they use real slowly making America great again which everyone on the Republican side half the country has been a part of and that is what's problematic this goalpost of this is bad and this is bad you should never be on one of these extremes let's find some common ground the middle is skewed because the side on the Left this is clearly happens this is a known terrorist organization that the US State Department recognizes and on the right you have a made-up right-wing terrorist organization that is not actually recognized or anything like it in fact the terrible pundit guided they choose is just a caricature of everything if you've heard people on CNN fighting against we're attacking these people who are openly racist misogynist and want to destroy all these immigrants and kick everyone out of the country like literally a perfect just cartoon character what the left claims to be fighting against and saving us from the United States except this guy doesn't exist you can listen to any of those far right-wing speakers that I do hate and none of them are as bad as this guy meanwhile on the left there is literally Eric Clanton the bike lock guy and the real organization that is recognized and still artificially creating this horrible villain on this side they still skew left even though this is reality all the cops that are supposed to be centrist you left the other thing that's the most problematic to me we're in the open court case where we as the audience is brought in to decide okay which side are we on who did it you have the far left people openly admit that he assaulted this girl I used physical force I heard her all its kind of stuff but did I rape her I don't know I'm gonna be that bad on the right he just says and believes a bunch of awful things and the court case is thrown out because it's neutral they can't decide which is exactly where the left is bringing us that words equal violence these are somehow equivalent no they're not we live in a society where you can wave your arms around as much as you want and scream whatever you want but as soon as you hit me you are going to be destroyed there's a massive difference between believing and thinking things that may be terrible and actually doing horrible and terrible acts towards other people and this has seen so much so in this episode that the poor woman they completely villainize who was the victim who was brutally raped with a sign never finds justice and you never even feel bad for that is the danger this episode and that's why there's so much controversy I just know people can make a clear distinction between the fiction and the real-world events that this law and order case depicts if not not even ice-t can save us then I've been Davies is pure Hollywood and don't forget now the rebel app is now available you can download it directly to your phone to get instant access to the entire rebel lineup
