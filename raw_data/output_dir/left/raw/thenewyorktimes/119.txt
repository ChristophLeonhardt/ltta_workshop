00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,560
These social
media posts belong

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,870
to an alleged Russian agent.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,910
She’s Mariia Butina.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,530
The U.S. has charged
her with trying

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,690
to influence
American politicians

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,410
and political groups to
advance Russian interests.

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:18,750
But she’s no shadowy
foreign agent.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,970
She’s all over social media:

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,490
at least 11,000 tweets, 100
YouTube videos, 4,700 Facebook

10
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,000
friends, LinkedIn,
a blog, etc.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,950
Let’s take a closer
look into these accounts

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,350
to find out who she is and
how she might have been

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,505
trying to wield influence.

14
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,910
This is Butina
during a photo shoot

15
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:45,270
for GQ Russia in 2014.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,880
She was a well-known gun
rights advocate in Russia.

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,502
And her early social feeds
followed her activism.

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,520
By 2015, she started posting
from the United States.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,740
These are from a
National Rifle Association

20
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,240
meeting in Nashville.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,690
They were posted on one of her
Russian social media pages.

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,760
U.S. court records show
that infiltrating

23
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
the N.R.A. was one way
Russia tried to influence

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,600
Republican politics.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,570
And Butina fit right in.

26
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,952
Here she is networking
with top N.R.A. officials.

27
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,440
Then there is the
Republican Party.

28
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,380
There’s a few ways
she gets inside:

29
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,320
at a teenage Republican
summer camp in South Dakota;

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,710
here she is with Wisconsin
Governor Scott Walker;

31
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,180
in 2015, she asked a question
of then candidate Donald Trump.

32
00:01:36,185 --> 00:01:37,775
“I am visiting from Russia.”

33
00:01:37,777 --> 00:01:40,803
“Ah, Putin. Good friend
of Obama, Putin.

34
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:43,320
He likes Obama a lot.
Go ahead.”

35
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,770
“My question will be
about foreign politics.”

36
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,380
At a prayer
breakfast in 2017,

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,660
she posed with her
alleged handler,

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,760
an influential
Russian official now

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,650
under U.S. sanction.

40
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,410
And right here is where
President Trump spoke

41
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,540
that same morning.

42
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,170
All the while, Butina
maintained the

43
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,440
image of an active twentysomething.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,270
She studied
international relations

45
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,430
at American University.

46
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,310
She exercised and
took flying lessons.

47
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,650
But now her social
feeds are quiet as she

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:00:00,000
sits in U.S. custody.
