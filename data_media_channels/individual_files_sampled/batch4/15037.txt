yeah it's a bursary one year chompin birthdays a year since EB was like anniversary because it's a bathroom I always say retard yeah yeah a year ago the Americans made the best decision of 2016 they did okay save the world well done Hillary being so sure save the world and with that yeah we're on TV so so what what what's the prep prep so there's a documentary where were undercover where they went undercover and they exposed me and Lucy and some other people are saying things that we say in public hmm I guess that's why it's on 11 o'clock at night they didn't get anything but we could have saved them a year like we could have saved them a whole year by just pointing them to our Twitter accounts and what is this let's give it what should we watch we can't wait we can't wait this was filmed by our friend hazel oh yeah thanks hazel who's probably not actually called hazel in real life but we hung around with her she seems like a nice girl so hmm where 10 5 right let's go that's a racist language from the start reasonable reasonable reasonable so difficult I know if they did really infiltrate she just turned up to an open meeting we penetrate in a circle we welcomed her in I guarantee you there not one single undercover thing on me in this documentary i penetrate shit he's an option what one of those things that we oppose Oh God so how were the bad guys how are we the bad guys for that terrorist attacks oh this is the old fart of Nick Griffin and the BNP wiping up Fri so why is it I would focus on positive anti-immigrant to them to you are you aunt immigrant no you aren't immigrant which one in particular it seems the new flower light has an unexpected profile its supporters are younger with women getting involved in the good-looking it is I remember that meeting that's the first time I met hazel and she just turned up and she was drinking champagne with us and because she was just sat there so confidently I assumed everyone else knew her they didn't very shocking how bigger the groups they run and are they dangerous no I'm right seriously dangerous three young women who were calling hazel Mary and Sarah are going to try and find out which means they'll have to play a long game slowly building up they are online yeah I know what she said today she wrote this piece for Huffington Post and she said I found myself getting drawn in at times and then I had to remind myself so yeah you're getting drawn in because you're listening to people telling the truth you listen to decent people like Amory the same sensible do we know do we know if in this in this program if they include any of the X Muslims and in the black people I guess we'll say she make a peep I really diverse crowd of people she met even met a Muslim on our side dish now I wonder if they'll cover it I made that logo I got lunch at the German anti-islam group Paquita in the UK oh you've got a halo Tommy posit far-far Roy agitator yeah that's you is that why I'm yeah

and tell me how I'm a farmer I don't know you've got a fatty haircut there though hey remember me I was wearing that wool blazer top too like a sponge we got like ninety five hundred people oh that's good thanks good day she's now I would say certainly the top two or three most prominent anti-islam activist we don't talk about Muslims she believe she's fighting the wall surtax Walters Twitter following Jim's to 40,000 soon after Walters makes a bold announcement she's going to run for the leadership of UK for the voice against a civilization to be heard I will stand in the UK leadership election I like that voice it sounds a lot like a good productive hazing travels to a rally in Manchester this was a wicked day great day look I loved when Johnny by John Banks said what was it alle was not a pedo Allah did not exist Muhammad was a Muhammad was the pedo yeah shagging kids making the pedo yeah it's not real well for the middle of the crowd hazel watches as we'll just taste the stage as this video clip shows waters message seems to work the ground no no look at that far-right flag right there three weeks later hazel heads to other room where waters is launching a manifesto this was the big going undercover until it is complete what is placed on the official ballot is not confirmed masses of people in New York it's not a tiny minority of extremist at all and I want the truth great speech hazel joins waters and so you got where's the camera where is it is it in those little dangly things and holders in the bathroom she's filming yourself laughter words secret funny she just it also form of being a parent to this channel Oh face make me pretty low don't they well she leaks but waters and pop be thinking not to publicize his exact role during her bid for that you can leadership liar sorry I did a good job came second to corruption Alabama in the suit yes insist she should be allowed to stand we all have to go through it and if you all get through that then you have the right standard extreme statements not to the car in profit she's even more blunt Oh what's she gonna say what a bigger arm what are disgusting I have never heard British girls being treated like that as they are Muslim countries you know a lot of Muslim women who can't drive who can't go out their house who can't leave can't do anything she can't bear the idea that would happen to British girls well it's which is already happening to many British girls here now many British Muslim girls five thousand last year had their genitals mutilated for God's sake she's a real feminist that's years she's a real feminist back home I love the country I love it so while she's saying this and while Hazel's got the recording and stuff horse hazel hazel thinking nothing Nancy Nancy Nancy I love my country I can't bear the idea of young girls know this I I think I think I bet I bet we've thought this whole thing hazel struggled in her head I reckon she had bouncing thoughts backwards and forwards saying I know she's not what she is but she's been told that that's what years so she carried on today but this is her job is to do this so it doesn't really matter well if it's her job and she did this because of the money then that tells you exactly what kind of person should we call that the purple pill that's when you kind of in the middle I'm not I'm not been on the Internet yes please yes sign me up the majority is breech public degree I know oh you're notorious past our campaign I can't why I didn't hear that what shit show because of you you can't officially do that yeah I want to hear this she doesn't Amory's the most loyal sweetest woman I've ever met doesn't care she judges people by the cut quite wonderful judges people by the content of their character and not by that skin but the past she judges me based on Who I am and what I say few headlines know I'm quoting the one of your old mates from black lives matter the official events why would journalists keep tracking her down outside the conference center the tone is very different to the cartoon yeah because you swear in private you don't swear to journalist yes these guys there was a black guy going

Jesus well you've wasted my whole hazel I've never met you you've room a fucking night and oppression usually associated with the far right she's clearly and consistently said she does not blame all Muslims but is criticized in the quran it is her fundamental right to do so what others say it events is not her responsibility and she does not agree with every view to things she speaks that she did not try to conceal her involvement with Jack Buckley she says much of what we recorded on covert camera she has said in public she doesn't believe no she said all of it she said him father he told us my reporter how dangerous neo-nazi bah he left the DMV partly because of anti-semitic abuse huh he has never condoned violent activity or terrorism and deleted his street because it was not clear he says he opposed the far-right and is not a racist he does not deliver the views of Jordan Dimond it has nothing to do with Mark Collett he says he talks about Islam that was not demonize the Muslim community true this has been like an advert for I think watching this memory Wars has come across absolutely brilliant this the staunchest and the most fearless woman in the UK that's how she would
