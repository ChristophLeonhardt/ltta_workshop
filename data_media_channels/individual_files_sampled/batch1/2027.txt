it's official tax reform is happening now all that's left to do is figure out what that means for your money one of the most important things that will be changing is your tax bracket whether you're a single filer or a married person who filed jointly separately head of household your tax bracket will be new in 2018 most Americans will see their tax bracket decrease as a result of tax reform but the only way to know for sure is to compare your current tax bracket to what your tax bracket will be next year Business Insider has put together some helpful charts so you can look at them side-by-side the highest earners will see their tax bracket drop from thirty nine point six percent in to thirty seven percent next year and so on down from there another big change is that personal exemptions have been eliminated but your standard deduction will be larger as a result for single filers this means you get suited up to twelve thousand dollars and married couples can deduct twenty four thousand unless of course you itemize in which case that's an entirely different ballgame your tax bracket is important but it doesn't tell the whole story of how your taxes will change next year many people misunderstand how taxes are actually calculated first you have to figure out what your taxable income is so that means taking your salary and everything you earned subtracting out any deductions that apply for most people that means taking the standard deduction and then that leaves you with your taxable income from there you apply it to the tax brackets and kind of a step-up fashion so everybody pays ten percent on their first nine thousand or so of income for single people or 19 thousand or so for married people and then you move through the tax brackets until you end up in your final tax bracket so if your bracket is a twenty five percent you only pay twenty-five percent in taxes on the income you earn that fits into that bracket that's a good thing overall it means you're paying a little bit less tax than you think you are we know tax math can be hard so at Business Insider we've done the math for you we've broken down how your taxes might change next year based on the job you have now or the income now whichever way is easier for you to think about it let's take an example of a fast-food worker who makes about twenty thousand dollars a year a single childless taxpayer in that situation would see a tax cut of about nineteen percent for the year let's say you're a computer programmer earning about eighty five thousand dollars a year you'll still get a tax cut but it'll be a little bit smaller on a percentage basis we're looking at about seven percent back next year not all taxpayers will get a tax cut under this plan an anesthesiologist who's single and childless and making around two hundred and seventy thousand dollars a year will actually end up paying ten percent more once this bill goes into effect whether you expect to get a tax cut or to pay more in taxes next year there are certain things you can do before December 31st to minimize your tax bill for 2017 since tax brackets will be going down next year and many itemized deductions will be eliminated or limited it's really smart to take as many deductions as you can before December 31st so for example if you own a home you can pay next year's property tax bill now and deduct it on your 2017 tax return that's bound to save you some cash if you need to buy a new car you're better off doing it before the end of the year so that you can be sure to deduct all of the sales tax you pay on that purchase on your 2017 tax return self-employed people and freelancers don't have to finish paying their 2017 taxes until January but you'll definitely benefit from making that final payment before December 31st and one great way to reduce your tax liability which you can always do is to contribute to charities so when you're thinking of any end of your tax planning strategies that's a great one to keep in mind overall this is the first I'm the US tax code has changed significantly in over three decades there's going to be a big learning curve next year but the good news is nothing will really impact your taxes until you file your 2018 taxes in 2019 there's plenty of time for us to all figure out what this means for our money
