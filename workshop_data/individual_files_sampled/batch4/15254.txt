well guess who's coming to town it's perhaps the world's most infamous Pro Sharia feminist assuming that isn't an oxymoron yes it's none other than Linda Sarsour now you think there are enough hate mongers in Canada without having to import one from south of the border eh but then again Linda Sarsour is a superstar when it comes to the hate game she's an extremist she's a palestinian-american who uses her pulpit to preach her disdain of Western values and Israel and show her love of Sharia law naturally she takes full advantage of American liberties first and foremost freedom of speech now the Canadian arm of the Islamic circle of North America is hosting Saur Saur at its Carrie the like convention at the International Center in Mississauga this Thanksgiving weekend indeed one must wonder if Linda's our source upcoming presentation will be similar to her keynote address at the Council on american-islamic relations aka care in San Francisco last December according to the Washington report on Middle East affairs Tsar sewers Bay Area speech included such pithy prose as this quote you have no choice but to be political be engaged and be a part of the resistance to defend our rights to be Muslims in the United States of America dissent is the highest form of patriotism in a country like the United States end quote and according to Newsweek Sarsour stated at a July 2017 Islamic Society of North America event that standing up to Trump is a quote jihad end quote Saur Saur reminded her audience that quote are number one and top priority is to protect and defend our community it is not to assimilate and please any other people and authority our top priority and even higher than all those other priorities is to please Allah and only Ally end quote as well at the isne convention in September of this year in Houston Saur Saur who has a long history of making anti-israel remarks called on people to stop humanizing israelis and she's a big proponent of the BDS movement as well so when she comes to the Toronto area well Sarsour repeat her well-worn toxic talking points that she's so enthusiastically uttered in the past oh and there's more folks do you remember that sir sewer ones mocked en Hirsi Ali a former Muslim and a victim of female genital mutilation in a tweet sir sewer said that quote Brigitte Gabriel equals a n her CLE she's asking for an ass-whipping I wish I could take their vaginas away they don't deserve to be woman end quote how odd one someone that is a self-described feminist be against a procedure that mutilates woman then again maybe sir sewer has drunk the Hallel kool-aid when it comes to Sharia law and which women are not considered equal to men the alleged feminist actually calls the Sharia reasonable quote Sharia law is reasonable and once you read into the details that makes a lot of sense people just know the basics end quote sir su ur also has a soft spot in her heart for terrorists she's an active supporter of convicted and now deported terrorists Raz Mia O'Day who carried out a lethal bombing attack under the banner of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine Saur Saur calls O'Day a 68 year old who poses no threat really try telling that to the families of her murder victims and sir su ER has referred to Imam Suraj will Hodge as a mentor and motivator check out this clip and to my favorite person in this room that's mutualism am suraj Mahad who has been a mentor and motivator courage or of mine someone who has taught me to speak truth to power and not worry about the consequences who some mentor missing from her descriptor of imam mahadji is that he was listed as an undated co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombings although he denies any involvement by the way this Imam will be attending the ethnic Canada event two birds of a feather I suppose this odious list of hateful rhetoric just goes on and on but what should we do about it folks we don't support censorship or banning people there's already way too much of that going on today so I think the better idea is to show it's not attendees what Linda Sarsour actually stands for using her own words here's our idea it's time to engage that truck equipped with a Jumbotron that will displace our sewers hateful words for all to see now it cost about sixteen hundred to rent this vehicle plus gas money but it's a worthwhile endeavor we want ordinary citizens in the Toronto area to realize exactly who has come into the country and what she stands for and we want to put it on the record that Canadians don't support sir sewers hateful toxic comments I also want to give our petition to Edna were thousands of names of Canadians who oppose this Islamist hate fest that's our plan one that respects freedom of expression but shame signa while forcing attendees to come face-to-face with Sarsour hatred if you agree with our plan please help us out sign our petition at Linda Sarsour CA a petition that I will personally drop off at Ignace headquarters and please help us pay for the jumbotron truck - we'll need at least 1,800 dollars to cover all expenses again please take a stand against hatred by signing our petition right now Linda Sarsour dot CA and please donate whatever you can spare to pay for this very important mission thank you hey folks do you want to take a stand against hatred in our country then go to Linda Sarsour CA and please sign our petition
