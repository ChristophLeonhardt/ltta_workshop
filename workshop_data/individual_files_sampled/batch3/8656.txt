SCENES WITH FRESHMAN HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS TO WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE TO WORK ON THE HILL AND TO TRY TO FIGHT UPSTREAM THIS SYSTEM. IT COMES AT THE COVER OF THE NEW ISSUE OF THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE IS RELEASED. IT SHOWS PRESIDENT TRUMP TRYING TO CHIP HIS WAY OUT OF A VERY DEEP SWAMP THAT IS FULL OF SNAKES AND INSIDE THE ISSUE THE ARTICLE IS TITLED TRUMP VERSUS THE DEEP STATE, HOW THE ADMINISTRATION'S LOYALISTS ARE QUIETLY RESHAPING AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. HERE IS EVAN, THE AUTHOR OF THAT IS. HE WAS ON MSNBC EARLIER TODAY. WHAT THIS PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS IS THAT HE'S GOING TO TRY TO GET THINGS DONE PERSONALLY AND EVENTUALLY HE'S HAD TO TRY TO REORDER, RESHUFFLE AND REALLY CHANGE THE NATURE OF GOVERNANCE SO THAT THE VOICES THAT ARE BEING HEARD ARE ONES WHO WILL SPEAK UP ON HIS BEHALF AND THAT DISSENT AND DEBATE WILL BE SIDELINED. Martha: JOINED ME NOW, DAVID BOSSIE, TRUMP 2016 DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE CHAIR MEMBER AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK. IF BOTH ARE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR'S. GOOD TO SEE YOU, THANKS FOR BEING HERE. DAVID, YOU HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THIS PRESIDENT. IN THE WAY THAT THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES LOYALISTS, AND WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE JETTISON FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION, IS HE RIGHT? THIS PRESIDENT RAN ON DRAINING THE SWAMP. THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN TENETS OF OUR CAMPAIGN, TO CHANGE WASHINGTON AND HE'S TRULY AN OUTSIDER AND A BELIEF IN HIS SAID THERE ARE NEARLY 80,000 FEWER FEDERAL EMPLOYEES TODAY THAN THERE WERE ONE PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME IN OFFICE 15 MONTHS AGO. THAT IS AN UNBELIEVABLE Martha: THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN AROUND TO FILLING SPOTS. YOU ARE SAYING THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF FILLING THOSE SPOTS? THESE PEOPLE ARE LEAVING, THEY ARE FLEEING THE SHIP BECAUSE IT'S NOT AS ATTRACTIVE AS IT ONCE WAS IN THE ECONOMY IS MUCH BETTER. THIS PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON THE DECONSTRUCTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING TODAY. Martha: AND DOES A LOT OF PUSHBACK, OBVIOUSLY. THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS ARE REALLY LIKE LIVING IN THAT ADMINISTRATIVE STATE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND SO INTERESTING, JASON CHAFFETZ, IS THE AREA IN AND AROUND WASHINGTON, D.C., AS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST AREAS IN THE COUNTRY, WHICH MAKES YOU WONDER, RIGHT? A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT WILL LIVE IN THAT AREA AND IT HAS GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN AND GROWN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES. DO YOU THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS HAVING ANY SUCCESS TRYING TO TURN THE SWAMP? THE PEOPLE IN THE DEEP STATE, THEY DO NOT LIKE TRANSPARENCY. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE CALLED ON THE MAT AND WHEN THEY A DIS THE MAT AND WHEN THEY A DIU THE MAT AND WHEN THEY A DIT THE MAT AND WHEN THEY A DIV THE MAT AND WHEN THEY A DIE PERSONALITY LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND HIS TEAM COME ALONG THEY WANT TO FLEE. THEY DON'T LIKE THE SUNSHINE, THEY DON'T LIKE THAT. I DO THINK HE'S MAKING PROGRESS. BUT REMEMBER, WASHINGTON, D.C., IF YOU SPEND A MILLION DOLLARS A DAY EVERY DAY IT WOULD TAKE YOU ABOUT 3,000 YEARS TO GET TO 1 TRILLION. THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS $4 TRILLION EVERY 12 MONTHS OF THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE GETTING RICH ALONG THE WAY. Martha: THE AUTHOR OF THIS PIECE, DAVID, TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE SEES AS THE POSITIVE THINGS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO. HE TALKS ABOUT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND REGULATING ASPECTS OF THE LIVES OF SENIOR CITIZENS, MAKING SURE PEOPLE DON'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND HE SEES THIS AS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY MUCH WORTH PROTECTING AND HE SEES PRESIDENT TRUMP AS TRYING TO DISMANTLE IT. WE ALL REMEMBER STEPHEN BANNON TALKING ABOUT DISMANTLING THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE, WHICH PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS SCARY. THIS GUY SEEMS TO THINK IT'S WORTH SAVING. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT NEWT GINGRICH 20 PLUS YEARS AGO, 23 YEARS AGO, IT RAN THE CONTRACT FOR AMERICA, AND PART OF THAT CONTRACT WAS ELIMINATING FEDERAL AGENCIES AND GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME. WAS AT THE TIP OF THE SPEAR ON THIS STUFF. DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES IN THE SAFETY NET. HE BELIEVES IN GOOD GOVERNMENT, HE JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE IN BLOATED GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED AND PRESIDENT TRUMP LEARNED IN SIGNING THIS REALLY BAD BILL IS HE'S NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN AND I THINK THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BRING HIM A BILL THAT'S MUCH MORE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE NEXT TIME. Martha: THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING BECAUSE WE WILL SEE THAT HAPPEN IN THE FALL AND THEN AGAIN IN DECEMBER. OPPORTUNITIES TO ACTUALLY HAVE A BUDGET AND DO NOT DO THESE CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS THAT JUST KEEP GOING ON AND ON AND ON AND ON IN THE GOVERNMENT. THE EVEN DARKER SIDE OF THIS, JASON CHAFFETZ, IS WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION SEES AS THE EFFORT TO UNDERMINE THEM WITH THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION AND THAT ALL OF IT GOES BACK TO THAT OF THEIR MOUTH STOMACH MOST POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADM POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADN POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADS POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADR POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADT POWERFUL TOOL TO PREVENT THE ADO FROM DOING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, WHICH IS TO SAY MAYBE WE DON'T NEED 15,000 PEOPLE WORKING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE FOR EXAMPLE. YOU TO HAVE THESE OPERATIVES WITHIN THE DEEP STATE THAT I CAME TO KNOW AND SEE UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL AND THEY WANT TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO EMBARRASS THE PRESIDENT. THEY WANT TO SLOW DOWN HIS AGENDA, THEY WANT TO SLOW WALK IT. THEY THINK THEY CAN OUTLAST THIS PRESIDENT. YOU HAVE PEOPLE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR, FOR INSTANCE, THAT ARE TRYING TO SLOW DOWN SECRETARY IS TRYING TO DO. WORKERS AND A LOT OF THEM ARE PATRIOTIC, THEY DO GOOD HARD WORK AND THERE IS A PROPER ROLE OF GOVERNMENT. BUT THERE'S FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE MAKING FAR TOO MUCH MONEY AND THEY JUST REGULATE THINGS TO DEATH AND THE PRESIDENT, RIGHT AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA IS TO GET RID OF THAT REGULATION. Martha: WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SHAKE-UP IN THE ADMINISTRATION, DAVID BOSSIE. WHAT THIS WRITER TALKS ABOUT IS THAT IF YOU DON'T PROVE THAT YOU ARE LOYAL TO THE PRESIDENT, IF YOU ARE NOT ON THE PROGRAM, HE'S GOING TO BOOT YOU, YOU WILL BE OUT. IS THAT TRUE? THAT SHOULD BE TRUE. YOU SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THE PRESIDENT, PERIOD. THERE IS NO AND OR BUT AT THE END OF THAT SENTENCE. YOU SERVE AT THE PLEASURE OF THIS PRESIDENT AND EITHER YOU ARE ON THE SAME PAGE ROWING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THIS PRESIDENT IS OR YOU CAN GO FIND SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. IT YOU CAN GO MANAGER RESTAURANT OR WORK SOMEWHERE ELSE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE LOYAL TO THIS PRESIDENT AND PEOPLE WERE GOING TO TRY TO MAKE A SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENCY BY FORWARDING HIS AGENDA. Martha: I THINK MOST PRESIDENTS WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE LOYAL TO THE AGENDA. CERTAINLY LYNDON JOHNSON TED AND PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD VERY LOYAL PEOPLE. SOMETHING TYPICALLY PRESIDENT WANTS TO DO, PEOPLE WHO ARE ON
