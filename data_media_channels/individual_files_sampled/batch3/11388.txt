hello and welcome to crosstalk we're all things to consider i'm peter Lavelle this is the last edition of crosstalk for the year and we're doing something different we answer questions from you our viewers crosstalking the year that was I'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Victor Oh Levesque he is a political analyst as well as a leading expert at the Centre for actual politics and we have Dimitri Babak he is a political analyst with Sputnik International all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it before we go to our our viewers questions I'd like each one of you maybe I will start here to kind of sum up some of the most important things that happened in the last 12 months and I think I'm going to kind of end the year on kind of a dramatic note I think we face and United States a constitutional crisis it's really very much coming to a head we have Congress that is not answering demands or we have a Department of Justice and the FBI they're not answering demands from Congress we see an outright media war depending on what station you look at you could be looking at a very different country and I'm looking at like Fox versus like CNN very different views of the world it's getting to a critical point it didn't happen in 2017 I think it's gonna happen in 2018 what's your major takeaway Victor the game-changer in 2017 is the victory by Russia Syria and their allies against terrorist organizations that operated in Syria for years against Isis against a noose against other others and this is really a game changer not just for Syria but for the Middle East as a whole but I don't think it's over yet mm but it's a very very major step it's a major setback for the United States and their allies mark a big take from the viewpoint of living in Russia the Russian media and and perhaps the alt media the left in the US this has been a year under siege a year of constantly having to battle back a neo McCarthyite narrative that not only intends to target Trump but intends to silenced voices of opposition with the left media Syria as well it's far from over but at least regime change is off the table but we whole new middle-east destabilization with Trump playing games and declaring Jerusalem to be talked about with our viewer viewers questions diamond go ahead I think 2017 was year a year of inconclusive endings to the crisis I think in Syria okay the the UK and France dropped for the moment the demand or Vasa to go but the United States remains there so the war is not over yet unfortunately but the crisis is over you know it seems me in a more end on that before we go to the questions there seems to be a crisis of leadership I mean as I was going to the studio here we have Rick's Rex Tillerson flip-flopping again on Assad I mean if we go back and forth like yes that's why I say it's in conclusion in conclusion I agree with you all right let's go to the first question from one of our viewers here my question is what exactly is the deep state and who's in it Victor as it's a good question or a deep state is in the Nexus of the US special services of the u.s. permanent political bureaucracy and the mass media that serves them and essentially it performs it controls the daily functioning of the nation while the president does his own thing what's really interesting about this term mark I think you pointed it out I think was a year ago almost exactly that we started talking about how the New York Times uses the term deep state that never was you in circulation in in the mass media and now it's somebody else had a deep state yeah okay so there's a long history of talking about the deep state academically in the u.s. back to eisenhower warning about the military-industrial complex but we have had a recent rejuvenation of it and the deep state has become active something it's not always at that you know supposed to because Trump challenged the deep state's establishment foreign policy and if we're talking about specific people we need to take a look it is difficult because if we knew who specifically is leaking and disrupting policy they'd be in jail Michael Morell the former acting director of the CIA a Clinton's surrogate and the one who infamously said to Charlie Rose that the US needs to start killing more Russians and Iranians the difference is here the deep state is where they're not supposed to be political they're not supposed to be active and now we have high government officials in the FBI looking for insurance policies to make sure their views come i think the deep state acts according to the ultra liberal globalist ideology it's it's there aren't armed wing as a desi communist if you know where weaponized wing which is not always seen but you know it relies on the ultra liberal ideology which which signifies that any cruelty NUI is justified if it promotes the so-called Western values not supposed to be sane but it certainly felt when they want you issues that democracy is not just a facade in the United States I would say we go through it's a fraud that disturbance our second question let's go to the second question what is the future with Ukraine is there Russian plan or shall some parts of Ukraine be like Somalia work yeah well there's a lot of discussion that Putin had a cunning plan at one point but I don't know if it's been so cunning what we have is a frozen conflict and I think we may see some some escalation you know they we say it frozen conflict there were four hundred and fifty to civilian deaths in the last year in done boss and that was but unfortunately the Russian government probably should have acted more proactively when this West back pushed first overthrew the government and seized power I warned about it at the time they did not now there is really no military solution and that the Kremlin is basically hoping that over time the corruption the unpopularity of this regime if it helps bring it down to the next plane in 2018 we know now that lethal weapons are being sold to the Ukrainian regime and that's that's gonna make this conflict but that's not well nothing well in now it's official powers go ahead believe it or not but Russia considers Ukraine an independent state so there was no Russian plan for Ukraine there was no booty you say the u.s. considers independence there's no such thing as independent states when it comes to the view of Washington either you're under their heel or you're an enemy between but probably that was indeed a mistake here I agree with mark Russia had no plan for Ukraine it hoped that common sense would prevail first it hoped that there would be because criticism of Russian foreign policies it hopes for reason absolutely that is not keep our viewers professional talkers third question what is the future of the Middle East may look like next year with Syria ending but Yemen and Lebanon continuing in the struggle and what might we see as actual policy in response to the Jerusalem decision okay so the Jerusalem decision by the Tramp administration actually gives opportunity to Moscow to Russia to become a much more active negotiator in the arab-israeli conflict and the Russia is also going to be much more active in discussions between Tehran and Riyadh it is no surprise that for the first time the king of Saudi Arabia came to Moscow to meet with Redeemer Putin in the Kremlin and now Russia is going to be much more active in the region America's foreign policy is destructive it's really interesting that you know the money pictures absolutely right is that you know it's because of the failed a proactive policies of Washington and his client states that actually open creates openings for for Moscow and Tehran go ahead first of all Syria is not over Libya is not over and Yemen is not over and none of them will be over next year either but at least with Syria now there is a light in the tunnel yeah the US has there's a lot of talk that Donald Trump has forfeited control of the Middle East to Russia by not being proactive and it's completely nonsense the u.s. is constant in the US and Saudi Arabia blowback against their repeated regime change and meddling in the region has hit them again and it again and again attempts to curtail the Iranian influence helps grow Russian influence if there's any obligation of responsibility it's it's Donald Trump of relying upon tel-aviv and we are well that's true but I think coming back to the results of the I think one of the main events was this trilateral meeting of the presidents of Russia Turkey and Iran that's a new juxtaposition of forces that is going to determine 2018 it's not going to be our versus Sunni it's not going to be pro-american versus I'll anti-american it's going to be sovereign states against the Western quarter God needs to be reminded of that because he just called the President of Syria a terrorist again the other day for that you know todai-ji politics is not about and it has never been about morality or about this it is an art of finding common ground with other nations and and using those unions those alliances against against adversaries so Turkey today is in a position it has not been in for the last 50 years today turkey has a much tougher relationship with Washington than ever before the post-war year so Russia again I thought it was Russia that was trying to create divisions with the NATO I guess what are their own members are doing it's not - Russians it's not the Russians portrait in front of a firing line in Norway it was Nita and it wasn't Russia that sponsored the coup in Turkey it was some western states and we can leave we don't know what is important is that now we have sovereign states versus US client states and this is going to continue and for Russia you know when people are esthetic about the Soviet Union that they say the servitude was so much stronger than Russia the Soviet Union only had dependence in the in the Middle East that wanted money from us you know Egypt under Nasser and others now we have the Saudi King coming to Moscow we have the Turkish president coming to Moscow they are whatever we think about them much more serious partners than the ones that we had before so from the point of view of Russia's national interest that is one of the main results of 2017 it will happen after our children will continue our discussion on questions from our viewers stay with RT yes so much the that Russia welcome back to crosstalk where all things were considered on Peter labelled Tremonti were discussing questions from our viewers alright gentlemen let's continue with our questions from viewers here that here's the next one if you couldn't project to five or even ten years from now in retrospect what would you consider to have been the defining global event that changed the future world either for the better or worse in 2017 that event will be the greatest long-term positive or negative effect for or repercussions I think we kind of didn't talked a little bit about them right now I think what's happening is it I think deema I'm gonna go with your thread here is it it's brexit and trump that happened the year before and we're still trying to get grapple with the outcomes of those two Democratic decisions I mean democracy got in the way with the of these global elites okay I mean going into leaving this year going to next we see Hungary and in Poland being sanctioned within the European Union because they're expressing their sovereign right I guess nobody told them when you join the EU you lose all of your sovereignty so and that's the cold reality that they're waking up to so talking about an event I wouldn't say it's an event it's a sequence of event that you juxtapose like Raul Castro said he would step down next year there will be another person running Cuba you have you got enough not challenging Putin any more there is a much more serious candidate now challenging him at the election you have Poland and Hungary basically opposing the EU you know with their elected governments on the other side you have RT been declared a foreign agent in the United States you have the French having a president for whom and minority vote that you know someone who wasn't wanted by the majority of the French and it was only thanks to manipulations that he became the president you have the longest post-war political crisis in Germany where they can't form the government so you see how the East is getting more and more democratic the former socialist world whatever code and the West is getting less and less democratic talking about foreign agents working for spies prohibiting people to talk to foreign ambassadors now we have members of Congress a that you know every Russian is suspect I mean I mean I mean what are they supposed to do wear some kind of a red star on their on their sleeves you know to mark posts that they thought were somehow related to Russia but then I guess too many people actually wanted to read those posts to see what it's all about and then Facebook stopped marking them so because to not to attract attention but really we are in between in a very special period in a period of change from Pax Americana from an America centric sole superpower world to a multipolar world so it's the end of the unipolar moment how much Washington wants to extend Pax Americana no matter what it does to to prolong its period of global dominance the dominance is going to weigh day by the Martland the same thing can be said about the monopoly that the mainstream media had for decades that's being broken up the fact that we're sitting here talking right now and viewers are watching us that monopoly continued to be broken in 2017 yeah but there's a lot of pushback reticulata support with with declaring foreign media to be in foreign agents and then trying to attach the label to the left and the old media the the paywalls that are going up across the the mainstream media outlets there there is a there really is an info war on the Internet although I think the common people are more the victims and that in with its this corporate mainstream media and then the stenography from the from the government that's pushing it but I agree with with Victor completely this is the year that the hegemon was challenged the hegemon was challenged at home with the election of Trump and the u.s. political regime both elected and the unelected portions are at war with itself it's shaking the USS role as not the leader of the free world but as the hegemon the global leader and legitimacy at home and abroad here that's good next question here probably the most controversial and I'm kind of curious that you guys are gonna react considering your old man is the moral corruption of the West in the formulation of its foreign domestic social and economic policy caused by feminism I think it's caused by primitive understanding of feminism I think this year will be remembered not only because of the end of Pax Americana but also it will be remembered in Russia for example by the attacks a media text against the women who opposed the global dominance look at Natalya pecan scab there was a whole campaign DCI gates in the Russian media in the foreign media you know now there's the subject that Ukrainian Cuba was released and her release was demanded by all the world's media nearly stabbed a woman man of an East Ukrainian town is sitting in jail since 2014 simply because she participated in the referendum on a federal a very interesting case I would say 2017 and listen the West is a war on men yes ok ok today we are talking about the wall and man and yes it's not just feminism it's actually red femme it's radical feminism from the 60s and 70s that that doesn't just oppose patriarchy but once meteor but the real in tu Toa pian sentiment is going to come in a few years we are actually today talking about rabbit rabbit ization a new industrial revolution and that brings the specter of a world where gender differences are not going to matter that much at all robots do not need sex and that is the real danger in the next decades ok the more there is moral corruption in the West but it doesn't come from feminism even from a few radical feminists in the later years that have gone off the ranch this show is made by women they're produced without feminism this show wouldn't be made so they've got no problems with classical feminism the rock comes from actually classical liberalism the cult of the individual and the reification of neo Beryl ISM the economic system of the unfettered unregulated free market over everything the marketization the commodification of all human relations that's where the real moral decay of the West comes from okay um I don't think we have any comments about in 2017 it was the year of the robe I'm thinking of a Harvey Weinstein and Charlie Charlie Rose did you say the robe the open robe I want to keep going here because I think this is a question that came from Don debar a frequent guest on this program and constant viewer he always is reminding me you know when is the program gonna be on YouTube okay will Trump be removed from office now Victor I'm gonna turn to you because I think almost every single episode you've been on a last six months you're predicting the removal of Trump from oh yes Trump will be removed from office in 2018 this is going to be his first in class new year in the Oval Office and the investigation cade by special counsel Robert Mueller is going to pressure those around him put pressure on his family members and essentially he's going to be asked to step down all right Victor one year from now we're gonna save this clip and then I'm gonna ask you to explain it or say I told you so go ahead mark Trump we don't know Trump may eventually be removed from office it most likely won't be in 2018 it will depend on how the Republicans do in the midterm elections do the main control and does Trump keep trying to push a foreign policy like they taught with Russia that's against the establishment so far it appears he's going in the opposite direction and bowing down to everything that neo-cons want at this point so I that way he's actually giving me what I've been saying this all along he said you know he does cave in time in time he doesn't get any kudos for it okay it only gets were no it's because like the neoliberalism this postmodernist project it doesn't believe in negotiation negotiated is called appeasement okay and then if you appease them they want more more true this is what the ideology was but I think that candidate who when you who said he wanted good relations with Russia who said that there are Russians living in Crimea and it's basically why should it be worn into Ukraine that candidate has been removed from oh absolutely so the candidate that was serious that was challenging mrs. Clinton that wanted to drain the swamp that candidate has been removed from office the fact that there is a person looking exactly like him sitting in the Oval Office and making some statements that is not very important was basically the DEP Trump the politician has been removed the Trump their official which may be still there the country remains terribly divided I mean we still have a lot of very deep deep red states here and this is what you know what we did actually did a program a civil war I mean I don't know to what degree it will get you know a hot you were it warm up but it certainly on a discursive opposing narratives that that that civil war is raging right now and I have every reason to believe it's going to continue in 2018 it is going to get even worse because these attempts to remove Trump they're going to divide the country even more you are exactly correct when you say that there is going to be there is a likelihood of a constitutional crisis Trump may attempt to fight back he may attempt to to accuse those who are trying to remove him of those misdeeds that they are guilty of and it will be very very ugly these people but these people don't they don't they have every expectation to ride this president out because they believe they know what's best okay and we all know you know these federal employees the life employees the vast majority of the mark are Democrats they pay the and give time to me contribution should the Democratic candidate we're talking about again the deep state this unelected bureaucracy that continues even after every four years the the political head changes year the hill reported that for the 2016 election cycle ninety-five percent of federal workers donated the Clinton that is only expected to continue in 2018 but relax the deep states frontmen this cabal of generals mattis McMasters Kelly they got this Trump has just about admitted that he's turned over for it and military policy to them right now he's just the Twitter and chief he's a figurehead he's something that they may find they can live with at least until the end of his regular four years twenty seconds there was an important thing that Trump did he he dumped TTIP and TPP so now it's clear that there won't be just one globalization there will be several globalization's one of them certainly centered on the United States the other one centered on China and on Russia so that is one of the main results of 2017 alright gentlemen many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching us here RT this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules
