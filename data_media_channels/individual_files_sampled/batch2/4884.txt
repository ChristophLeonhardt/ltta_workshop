I'm joined now by Chris Hill an MSNBC diplomacy expert and of course a former US ambassador to South Korea ambassador hill good to see you sir thank you so let's start with this why did Kim jong-un come to this summit well I think he came to the summit to sit on an equal basis with the President of the United States to have the North Korean flag interspersed with American flags and otherwise to become the great leader that he wanted to be I mean this is just pennies from heaven for the North Koreans I mean their propaganda is going to be full of this for a long time so I think he's done well he basically hasn't given up anything and I think your last panel pretty much nailed it on that on that agreement you know I was up watching the moment when the president came in and Kim jong-un came in to do this signing and nobody knew what they're about to sign I mean were they exchanging autographs who said it was really odd people started applauding but they weren't really sure what to applaud so you know I think probably we ought to just forget about this thing that was signed I mean this awful document and then turn it over to Pompeo and say okay Mike you got to run with with the next phase of this right put together some kind of action plan and go to work and by the way I don't think he's going to get any help from the National Security Advisor John Bolton so I think it's kind of in you know Pompeo is now in the hot seat and he's going to have to take this somewhere and I think the first question they're gonna have to ask is what do they want to do with South Korea Japan China yeah let me go to South Korea and ask you this because it seemed to be news to the South Koreans that President Trump said he would no longer call off war games and he called him because they're very provocative number one I'm curious of what you thought of that language that the president chose to use to describe military exercises between the United States in South Korea but second is it alarming to you that the South Koreans didn't know that was on the table that was alarming to me in the fact that he basically gave away in a meeting with the North Koreans and then gave the North Korean explanation for these so-called war games what they are as annual exercises where we test the ability of US troops to work with their South Korean counterparts they are peacefully they are peaceful exercises design for the purpose of dealing with a North Korean invasion and the North Koreans have nothing to fear from this so for the president to just take the North Korean line hook and say this is something we're gonna get rid of and then he makes the frankly bizarre argument that they cost a lot of money well they may cost a lot of money but they cost nothing compared to an eventual war so once again I think it was kind of shocking in fact I had friends in South Korea were just horrified that out of the blue comes the fact they're not only cancelling exercises but he also made the point that he's made before but it was kind of chilling to see him make it in Singapore after a meeting with the North Koreans that he wants to bring all the troops home anyway what if you're yours you sound pretty skeptical I think you're skeptical that the North Koreans will ever give up nukes I know I'm skeptical that they would what are they without nukes and and frankly the lesson around the world says what right if you have the nukes don't give them up if you want to stay in power that said is it possible the president has stumbled upon a strategy here that might work or are you what what has he done that you said you know what it's not what I would have advised but maybe with this weird leader in North Korea might work well first of all yeah I'm skeptical or at least of the view that it's going to be very difficult to do this but I'm absolutely of the view that this should be US policy to make North Korea get rid of those nuclear weapons so you know in negotiation it's always easier if you can be closer to your interlocutor than further away and for all the people who think we ought to be standing at a distance shaking our fists at the North Koreans I mean try it sometime it's not a very good way to negotiate so I kind of understand what he was doing I mean obviously some of the stuff was over the top and and the whole issue about human rights I mean it was a non-issue in the whole summit but I think what has to happen now is Pompeo has to figure out a regional regional strategy he's got to sit down with the Chinese who are not disinterested by all this he's got to sit down with the South Koreans and the Japanese reassure them and come up with something now obviously the president doesn't want to hear about six-party talks that was so george w bush he just doesn't want to go there well isn't Craig yeah I know right so he thinks he could pull this off by himself I think Pompeo or at least secretary Pompeo to take your bifurcation of that personality should understand that he needs China and needs these other partners and by the way you know I I mean I wouldn't get going about condos on the beach either but you know I think there can be a compelling case to be made to the North Koreans that their lives are going to be miserable as long as they hold on to these nuclear weapons would this have happened without a liberal government in South Korea because I've heard Ben Rhodes has made that argument going you know what we might have gotten this far down he said with North Korea because at the end of the day the South Koreans control this process and it's the South Koreans that this government moons government wants peace I don't know if at any price but at many prices and without it President Trump wouldn't have this much room you know with due respect to mr. Rhodes I think it's far more complex calculation than that yes there is a so-called progressive government that is invested in the idea of reaching out to the North Koreans dealing with Peninsula issues in this particular case who was a progressive government invested in the idea of kind of pulling Donald Trump back from the ramparts and getting him to to engage I get that but it's also a progressive government as with any government in South Korea who understands that the bedrock of that country's military strength is its relationship with the United States and so I can imagine the sleepless night fact he mentioned he had a sleepless night that moon jae-in had at the thought of somehow under his stewardship the US has pulled back from exercises or as the president bizarrely says war games so this is a big problem for the South Koreans and Pompeyo is the guy who's gotta get serious and fix this are you saying the South Koreans aren't look aren't looking forward to looking to China as their security umbrella no the United States walks away you know usually when you've had 3,000 years dealing with someone you kind of get a sense of their patterns and no I think the South Koreans have like this distant alliance that we have we're pretty good allied partner its Colin Powell said many times we're not looking for territory and we're pretty good partner to have we've helped make South Korea have one of the most capable militaries in the world not to speak of their economy so the problem now is going to be getting back to some kind of work plan and again I would just trash that thing that was signed I mean as someone who worked on the six-party statement worked every word of it and still had John bent and come after us just amazing it it is I think we're all got diplomatic whiplash is what I've been calling it anyway ambassador Hill thank you sir hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meat to press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
