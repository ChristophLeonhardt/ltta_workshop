you know those times when you have so much to say you don't know where to start this is one of them going to the prayer breakfast in DC speaking to so many people of faith watching Trump speak it gave me so much to think about I've hardly processes yet but at the same time I want to talk about the ongoing Nick Sounion cover-up by our news media who continue to do everything they can to hide and minimize the abuses of power of the Obama administration abuses that continue to haunt us today a case in point is the coverage of Rob Porter the Trump staffer who's resigned after two of his ex-wives claimed he beat them up now just to be clear if anyone I worked with beat his wife not only would I expect management to fire them I personally would pick them up by the ankles and repeatedly smack the top of their heads into the sidewalk I hope you're listening Knowles that's a joke I'm not talking about what I would do but I'm joking about Noel's never in a billion years so my point is the porter that porter is a scandal but it's not a big government scandal because whatever happens it won't make you richer or poorer safer or more exposed free or less free it doesn't speak into some massive corruption within the government it's just a major competence foul-up but the left sees it as a way of taking your mind off the FBI scandal continuing to poison women's minds against Trump and maybe getting rid of John Kelly because he's doing such a good job as I was traveling home in the plane last night I was able to switch back and forth between Fox News and CNN on midair satellite TV because we live in an age of miracles Fox News covered the new budget CNN covered Rob Porter Fox News covered Rob Porter CNN covered Rob Porter Fox News went on to cover the war in Syria CNN covered Rob Porter Fox News covered the FISA scandal CNN covered Rob Porter after a while I began to think I was going to switch over to CNN and see Don Lemon swinging a watch back and forth saying you're growing sleepy you will forget the corruption in Obama's Justice Department you will think only of Rob Porter what's interesting to me about this is after watching Trump at the prayer breakfast it's obvious that the president has learned how to change his tune since a year ago but news media continues to sound like this trigger warning action this is the Andrew Klavan show see top see more of the zipa teasing all right my friend Johanna hi it will be with us today she's working with live-action who are doing taking the fight against abortion in a really interesting different cultural direction

uplifting you know it's you're just in a hotel with thousands of people of faith gathered together to talk about their faith experiences I went to there is a media dinner before I spoke at that media dinner last year and it was I was one of the most successful speeches I think I've ever given but at the same time it was nice to go back there and listen to other people that be terrified to speak in public so I went to that and then I went to the prayer breakfast where Trump and other congressmen and and people of faith speak you know recently because I'm preparing for what I hope will be the second season of another Kingdom I've been going back and reading a lot of the books that inspired me when I was younger about King Arthur and a lot of the legends from that period because a lot of another Kingdom takes place in a sort of pseudo medieval world and and you know it's interesting when you go back and read classic literature and I'm reading some of the philosophy that shaped me as a young person I'm rereading a lot of things and it improves your mind and when I say that what I mean is it get gets you out of that Twitter social media craziness where everything is about the moment and everything and it suddenly returns you to the important things in life because the fact is the fact is listening to Aristotle figure out what's right is is more interesting and deeper and more relevant than listening to a brain scientist explain to you how the brain thinks about what's right you know that's that's really interesting I'm thrilled we're doing it I'm thrilled we live world of such scientific knowledge and mere technological miracles but it's more important what what iris audibles actually doing so going back into that world it really is elevating and the same thing was true with this faith gathering is that when you talk to people and I've noticed this before but I just really really came home to me again when you talk to people of faith you are talking to people they're not better than people of no faith they don't pretend to be they're not more moral anybody can be moral anyone can behave well that's not the point they are living a life that is deeper richer truer the things they think about are more real more relevant more meaningful more profound I mean everything and it doesn't matter whether they're intellectual people or non intellectual people when you sit and talk to him you can talk to anyone about faith and have a deeper conversation and you know sometimes in the mailbag we get these questions from people who think they're being clever they they raise what they think are paradoxes or contradictions or things that disprove faith as if people haven't been doing that for thousands of years they think they just came up with the big idea you know but they send it to and the thing is those questions do require intelligence and cleverness but faith requires something much deeper and richer than cleverness and intelligence which after all is only one of the gifts that people got so Trump like I said this yesterday but just to repeat it last year or the day before yesterday I was on Trump was like a guy who had been invited to the big boys table but didn't know how to use the silverware didn't know which fork and knife to use this year he he knows last year after beautiful speeches of people who fade this year like Steve Scalise who the congressman who shot was there and soldier who had lost his eyesight in Iraq and a bombing you know there's very inspiring guys last year after this very inspiring speech by Barry black the Senate chaplain Trump got up and made this kind of cynical you know remark about how maybe we should pray for Arnold Schwarzenegger because those ratings are so bad The Apprentice that Trump is gone that I mean here's here's just a cut of him and listen to this this is a different Trump than we saw a year ago or even six months ago our rights are not given to us by man our rights come from our Creator no matter what no earthly force can take those rights away that that is a different tone and I noticed this we all noticed this in the State of the Union that he's talking quieter he's not hitting those big heights he's not adding all the you know the wonderful wonderful wonderful adjectives as before there are two only two possible reasons for this one is he's bored with the presidency he's had it with the constraints of democratic governance and he's bored and he's getting tired and he's old and if he's not interested in he's you know he just starts to talk like that ah the other reason which seems far far far more likely from a guy like Trump is that he's doing what works Trump is at his core he is a capitalist and he is almost in some ways the Avatar of capitalism I'll talk about that in a minute because it really is important but he does what works that doesn't always that has nothing to do with morality that has nothing to do with being a high or low person but he's figured out that when he speaks as president to a faith gathering he has to be serious he has to be quiet he has to talk about faith it's not about Arnold Schwarzenegger ratings okay now you know you can say and of course I would say that that doesn't meet his character it has changed but that's only partly true you know Kurt Vonnegut wrote a book called mother Knight and the theme of mother Knight is you become what you pretend to be and it's very possible I mean the presidency people have noticed this through the years that the presidency elevates people and it's very possible that a trump who pretends to be the president will start to become in part the president but let's just say let's be cynical and just say his character remains the same but he's changed and he's he's singing a different tune he's doing the presidency okay the press has not changed at all they have not noticed for a moment that they they have been hysterical from the minute he was elected from the minute they lost the election from the minute this guy who they didn't understand didn't know and didn't want yet became president they have been hysterical not just to the press but the press is the mouthpiece of the Democrat Party the Democrat Party in general dan hemming or at The Wall Street Journal he wrote a really good piece today called the Trump panic and he says historians will record that the Trump panic gripped all Democrats some Republicans scores of intellectuals foreign leaders journalists and members of US security agencies on Election Day two FBI officials our friends Romeo Peters struck of the bureau's counterintelligence division and Juliet Lisa Paige his lover exchanged text messages Paige said oMG this is effing terrifying and struck responded oMG I am so depressed Henninger goes on to say recall how routine it was then to hear or read that the new US president resembled Hitler or Mussolini democracy was at risk even as such non Hitlerian pillars as Jim mattis Rex Tillerson and Gary cone joined the government and you can still see this overheated rhetoric is in their minds this idea that Trump is just absolutely beyond the beyond is in their minds here's here's Eric Holder who would they say is thinking of running for president I can't believe that but this is the guy who is the the first Attorney General to be held in contempt of Congress for stonewalling them about what the administration was doing so he exemplifies the corruption of the Obama administration he himself called himself Obama's wingman to stop for a minute and imagine Jeff session saying I'm Trump's wingman this is the Attorney General saying that's he Stonewall Congress he was held in contempt now this is what he's saying about Trump would you make a better president how was that it's pretty pretty good though I snuck that in there right yes that's pretty good I think any one of my kids would make a better president than then than Donald Trump but you know I think there are a number of people who would be a better president and the person we now have in the White House who has as I said broken through those norms conducted himself in a way that's inconsistent with what's best about this nation you know labeled people in very inappropriate ways use inappropriate terms when talking about countries turning his back on our immigrant heritage you have any number of people I think would be a better president than Donald Trump now Trump has done some of those things as you know violated norms of conversation and argument but he hasn't made like a disastrous deal with Iran you know he hasn't pulled out of the Middle East and said it like Isis on fire to burn the Middle East he didn't sit on our economy in the name of fundamentally transforming the greatest freest most powerful most generous country on earth he didn't do any of those things so that the need for panic is a little bit you know off the grid so under this panic Henninger goes on to talk about this the the insulated and I believe corrupt Obama FBI DOJ lost its way and started to spy on Americans and spy on an opposing political campaign because they were in a panic and so did the media the media had already become so partisan as even under Clinton really they had become partisan certainly under Bush but as they became partisan in support of Democrats and against Republicans Obama used that to lure them down the road of corruption because his administration was so corrupt they had to close their eyes to corruption these are reporters their whole instinct their whole purpose in life is to get dirt on powerful people and yet that was suppressed not so much by the reporters but by their bosses and now it's suppressed by the reporters too they have learned that their job depends on covering up for Obama they the old reporters would have quit if they were told not to cover stuff like this now that's not gonna happen they're going to go out and do what they do sharyl Attkisson the last reporter in America she had this incredible description of the press and it is exactly accurate we have invited some of the propagandist into our newsrooms we allow them to dictate the talking points and messages du jour and it's getting more difficult I think to find sort of down the middle on biased reporting I've never seen anything like it in fact I commented that you know I've never in my lifetime seen open government groups and journalists so uncurious and begging not to be told about alleged or supposed violations of citizen's right she's right they are begging on air we see them on CNN on in the New York Times at the networks we see them begging not to be told because why be if they're told that the Obama administration was corrupt as it was they're also being told that they let it happen and so as I've said before you know once you start to rationalize your bad behavior that's how you get worse if they said you know what we blew the Obama administration in the name of our ideology and racial pathology then they could start to cover Trump as they should and there's plenty to cover about Trump good and bad some of the things he's accomplished have been absolutely terrific some things obviously flawed now we're seeing stuff about Trump that you know we've been worried about we conservatives have been worried about we see with this the new government funding bill it's right basically paving the way for two years of funding the government pushing they say the deficit up to Obama zero levels now I'm a little bit I have to say I'm a little bit doubtful about this because I think they are misreading their miscalculating the effect of the tax cuts but they always say as well if you cut taxes by a dollar it's gonna raise the deficit by $1 because now we don't have that dollar but the truth is when you cut taxes the economy booms you collect more taxes so it's almost always true it's on a graph you know you can cut too many taxes but I do think that that will cut down the deficit if they use it to that effect and also the funding that they were proving in this new bill is not the funding that makes us bankrupt which is entitlement funding it's the funding that you can't turn off the spigot you can't turn off that's what needs to be done but Trump has promised not to do it so he's very big on keeping his promises to his base I don't know if he won't do it I don't know if he won't turn around and say look I made a mistake we have to do some of this stuff but right now this is a scary bill that raises spending to a catastrophic level so Rand Paul who sometimes I like and sometimes I think is a showboat try to hold this bill up through procedural measures and he made a speech I have to say that really did ring true which is a cut number six when the Democrats are in power Republicans appear to be the conservative party but when Republicans are in power it seems there is no conservative party you see opposition seems to bring people together and they know what they're not for but then they get in power and they decide hmm we're just gonna spend that money too we're gonna send that money to our friends this time the hypocrisy hangs in the air and chokes anyone with a sense of decency or intellectual honesty the right cries out our military's hollowed out ev'ry spending has more than doubled since 2001 the left is no better Democrats don't oppose the military money as long as they can get some for themselves signals they get some for their pet causes the dirty little secret is that by and large both parties don't care about the debt so so that's Rand Paul and he's right there there's a lot of not paying attention to the debt because present money is what gets you elected and by the time the debt comes do it in time the debt really hurts us you'll be out of office you don't care anymore that's how la is run that's how California is run entirely that we're completely broke because we hit can't pay off our pension funds and they're gonna have to tax people that in all kinds of ways to pay off those tat pension funds and ultimately the guys waiting for the pensions are going to get screwed but we keep talking about how we have this wonderful surplus because we're taxing people so much and it's it really is a question of time so if Paul is right about this meanwhile the left was against this because it doesn't attach the daca the dreamer bill to the spending right that's what they wanted so Nancy Pelosi got up and just made a complete buffoon of her she can't make a buffoon of herself she's already there but she did this thing where she just mr. Smith goes to Washington thing where she got up in filibustered and she talked about how wonderful the dreamers are I just have to play this one clip because there you have Rand Paul talking sense right and that's the right and now on the left you Nancy Pelosi talking unbelievable crap but she's talking about how wonderful Mexican people are I guess I'm reminded of them my own grandson he had a very close friend his name is Antonio is from Guatemala and he has beautiful tan skin beautiful brown eyes and the rest and this was such a proud day for me because when my grandson blew out the candles on his cake they said did you make a wish and he said yes I made a wish and said well what is your wish he said I wish I had brown skin and brown eyes like Antonio so beautiful so beautiful the beauty is in the mix so would it have been beautiful with Antonio wish to have white skin nuts not gonna insult the woman's grandson but I mean come on she is absolutely out of her mind but here's the thing here is the thing about Trump because the reason he doesn't care about debt the way I think he should because debts you know you can't pay off government debt it's not like we're supposed to be out of debt it's just that out-of-control debt will destroy a country like it did Greece and will destroy trust in your country and trust and you know in governance and Trust in your monetary system but the Rema Trump doesn't care because he is the ultimate capitalism and capitalism which people don't always understand is all about debt it is all about credit and and there's good about about that and there's bad about that here's Trump in the campaign let's just to remind you what he said about debt he was talking about the fact and this was something the press couldn't understand at all that interest rates are definitely going to go up and so we can buy back our debt at a at a discount but here is what he said about debt that made a lot of news at the time you know I'm the king of debt I understand debt better than probably anybody I know how to I know how to deal with that so we're very well I love that but you know its debt is tricky and it's dangerous and you have to be careful you have to know what you're doing but let me just tell you if there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount us in other words interest rates go up and the bonds go down right and by dad that's what I'm talking about so Trump is absolutely right about this but the essential thing that he said is that he loves debt but debt is dangerous okay as so let's go back to what I said before about Trump being a living living spirit of capitalism he is the avatar of capitalism now capitalism you know we I love capitalism it has lifted more people out of poverty than any other human system ever has I mean it is on track to eliminate poverty it has expanded the sciences because capitalism needs the sciences in order to expand and the sciences need capitalism in order to fund what they do capitalism includes hucksterism overblown sales techniques it's the best it's the the great is coming by it that's Donald Trump capitalism involves a certain amount of immorality and cynicism like selling trucks with Martin Luther King speeches you know like yeah you know Martin Luther King buy my truck you know Martin Luther King said this let's so buy my truck capitalism does that and Trump is is like that capitalism sometimes doesn't care what's right or wrong it just cares what works Trump can be like that too but but okay capitalism is also faith in the future that is the only reason capitalism exists is because people will loan money to other people to take their business to begin their businesses in the faith and hope that that business is going to succeed and expand and create enough money to pay back that debt with interest that is the essence of capitalism capitalism is based on trust that's why when people get nervous the stock market drops because they they're losing their trust now hopefully they only lose it for a day but they keep it in the overall you know system that's going forward capitalism is about faith in the future and that is yes it includes a certain amount of cheerleading and carnival barking and a certain amount of risk too but it also involves hope and faith progressives are locked in the past before before there was technology and science and things were changing you could make the argument that wealth was a zero-sum game you could make the argument that the prince in his tower and his palace was in his palace because you were out in the streets starving you could make that argument but ever since capitalism you can't make that argument anymore because when people when the princes of capitalism make money they don't sit around in a tower they reinvest it and they hire you to do their fly there are private planes and take care of their pools and their houses and they hire the rest of us I should say to do those things and capitalism grows and it grows and grows progressives are lost in the past with this zero-sum and they're not hopeful I've been playing that stuff all week it's all about oh my god don't touch the earth because the earth will run out don't do this don't to make too much money because then you're evil and people will be poor don't go into space there are too many problems here they want us to languish in fear and real conservatives I'm trying to conserve what we have instead of trying to go and get more and that's why they don't trust the people because the people invent stuff the people improve things left alone if you give them capitalism the people will make new stuff they'll go in their garage and say hey I wonder if I could make a machine that can add you know I wonder if I can make a machine that can talk around the world in a single second Trump is right about two things debt is dangerous but debt is great credit is great it's the basis of our system but it's dangerous because faith is dangerous and the future is dangerous and change is dangerous and giving power to the people is dangerous and I kind of wonder if that more than anything else is what Trump hysteria is all about people who are afraid of the future people who are afraid of the people people who were afraid of trusting in the capitalist system there are all kinds of things about Trump that I dislike I've talked about this a lot but his his capitalism is not one of them capitalism does make things better even as it is ugly and huxter Ian and fake and Trump carnival barker that he is has so far made this country better and there's just no arguing that this is a better country than it was a year ago it is working better things are going better and I hope that continues we will see all right before I get to Johanna Hyatt who I want to get to in just a second I have to talk about the Valentine's Day conversation I don't know if you saw Knowles's video for this it is one of the

to you guys so Wednesday February 14th at 5 p.m. Eastern 2 p.m. Pacific join the conversation alright so a couple of about a week ago two weeks ago we had Andrew Hyatt on the director of the new film Peter Paul apostle of Christ I can't mess up the title every single time it's going to be at Sony's big easterly's paul the apostle of christ and when I first went to one of Andrews screenings this incredibly attractive eloquent young lady came up to me and said hi I'm the sex lady and I thought gee I've dreamed about this day it's but I never thought it would really happen but Joanna Hyatt Andrews absolutely beautiful and intelligent and also beautiful wife it was the sex lady because she would go around giving speeches about responsible Saxon and how to and how to treat yourself how to treat your body how to treat your soul she had a wonderful line she would say there's no condom for the heart and I thought that was actually absolutely brilliant line she is now the director of strategic partnerships for live action a nonprofit that educates the public on abortion and the humanity of the preborn they have a terrific very successful videos we will talk to her about it Joe it's wonderful to see you you're so kind but you forgot to mention I was about 35 weeks pregnant when I didn't see that's why you were so beautiful well you look great still and it simply to see you I always say I never see my friends I only interview them at this point but you look great it improved it improves me tremendously so you're working with live action who's the leader of live action that's right and and it's been it's got this really interesting way of approaching this but I want to talk to you first about this recent vote in Congress that failed to outlaw abortion after 20 weeks which I keep reminding people is five months now I looked at that failure and I asked myself do they really want to do this and that's what I won't want to know do you think that there's any political will to curtail abortion or stop it I think it's shocking to me how extreme the Democrats are except for the three that did vote in in favor of the bill but you know you've got a Marist Poll just came out that showed three-quarters of Americans actually want to limit abortion to the first trimester so you've got the Democratic Party voting over here and the American public's on the other side of the spectrum and so I think they are so entrenched with the abortion Lobby that they can't see even beyond what's best for them as a party Republicans I think do have the will to do it not all of them are cows king collins consistently vote in line with anything that promotes abortion protects Planned Parenthood so we need to see a shake-up of the Senate before we're going to actually successfully I think jump some of these hurdles but do you think it's possibly you don't think this is just vertically okay I think it's possible because the people are in agreement with restricting abortion and so it's more alerting them to hey your senator your congressman voted actually in a way that's very extreme and outside the norm and against what you believe so if you want to see changes change who's in office you know I mean one of the things that always strikes me I think it strikes everybody who deals with this subject is that if it is true as it seems logically it must be that an unborn child is an actual human being you know an actual individual not the mother it's not the same DNA it's not the same it's not the same person what's happening in our country which i think is what 3,500 abortions a day it is a catastrophe on a major scale I mean I always tell people that while they're pulling down statues of robert e lee remember the statues of the people who supported this atrocious moment that we're in are also going to be pulled down when people catch on but it's it seems to me that somehow the culture has shift before we can deal with this the mindset has to shift and that's kind of what that is that the idea of live action yes and that's what we're working on is getting people to understand actually what is abortion and the humanity of the child and you know a couple years ago we released a series of videos called abortion procedures and we use medically animated graphics we know that seeing a real abortion could be quite traumatic and we wanted to invite people into the conversation who might not actually know what abortion is and so you see these four videos narrated by a former abortionist and the response has been overwhelming of people saying I had no idea this changed my mind and I think we assume everybody knows what abortion is but we're actually not talking from a place of knowledge because that word has been kind of cleaned up and dressed up and one in particular striking to me we took it to the streets and showed it to people and one guy said he starts off with you know we asked were you pro-choice because one hella liberal so of course I am and at the end after watching one video he says I think we're more humane in the way that we put down animals then we treat these children you know and so being able to understand in three minutes what abortion is about is why live action exists to be able to help change people's hearts of mind because you're right we have to move the culture before we can really see politics respond to where people are at and a demand for a change on behalf of the unborn I mean it always seems to me with the left that nothing drives them crazy so much as the truth the direct truth and when I listen to the people at Planned Parenthood and I have to believe that these are not like satanic evildoers are at like delight and killing children I mean I have to believe that they are not seeing what's right in front of their eyes but when I listen to them as a writer when I listen to their use of language the fact that they will not say the words they will not talk about an unborn baby they will not say you know they constantly direct words away from the facts of the matter so let me just run a couple of their arguments by you and just let let me hear what you have to say I mean the big one as always well if we outlaw abortion they'll be these back-alley abortion will go back to this world of back-alley abortions and women be dying all over the place well I think first of all we have to remember that those numbers that they're based off of were trumped up when Larry larder and bladder and Bernard Nathanson were pushing for abortion they inflated the number of women that were getting these back-alley abortions and those abortions were occurring by the way by very reputable doctors so it's not for the most part women were not taking coat hangers themselves and the reality is right now women you know go and get abortions because it's easy it's accessible and in a lot of these places it's really the only option presented staggering numbers of women will say I felt like abortion was my only choice I felt like I didn't have any other support and so the emphasis is saying how do we come around a woman and really support her as a community there's a lot of government programs there's a lot of private organizations that you excellent work in walking through women in these situations and the left wants to completely discount that as though a woman is not strong enough or capable enough to walk through a pregnancy and raising a child and I think it's fear-mongering and you won't actually see massive amounts of women running it to grab you know coat hangers and find doctors in back alleys what you're gonna see is women who are saying you know what I think there might be a better way and I think I can do it and we as a society can step up and support them and help them in that the argument that always stopped me and it took me a long time to come around to where I am I was pro-abortion for a very long time and I've told this story before but I lost an argument with a friend you know our you'd with him till 2:00 in the morning and I walked away and I thought gee I lost that argument and it still took me over a decade to change my mind and the argument that the reason was is I want people to be free I'm not an entire libertarian but I'm mostly a libertarian and I want women to have the lives they want and I understand that there's a tremendous disconnect between you know a drunken hookup that you might have and suddenly not only have you had a baby inside you but it's that guy's baby you know some clowns baby that you didn't even like to begin with so what is the argument I mean when women say hey you know you're forcing me to carry child what how do you respond to that well I mean first of all no one's forcing anyone we're not bandaging you up and keeping that baby inside of you but I think one it's a disconnect of understanding rights you know like that child also has rights and you as a woman got these rights to choose what to do with your body well when did those rights begin and if they didn't begin for you in the womb then then when at what point because that same child that you are now carrying has rights that needs to be on it as you mentioned it's a separate person and you know cases of rape and incest I understand that was not a choice although that child still has value but in every other situation you made the choices that got you to that place which is really hard for us as a society to talk about and I think the root issue is that we don't want to address that our sort of freewheeling sexuality has gotten us to this place where we still have to deal with consequences and the left doesn't talk about that this total reproductive feminist movement wants to say you know your body your choice and yet you have to deal with what those choices lead to just like you would with a sexually transmitted infection you know the emotional impact that's why I talk about no condom for your heart because we don't talk about the emotional and so the idea is that in this case you have two competing rights and you know the Constitution guarantees the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness if you don't have life you can't pursue the others and so that child's right to life in this case I would say Trump's your right to to be able to take it or leave it and there lie again a lot of people who would happily take that child and raise it and love it but I think we have a lot of work to do stepping backwards to help people understand your choices have consequences you cannot separate sex from reproduction however much you think it you can I once tent very tentatively mentioned this to a feminist that you know babies don't just get in there by lightening you actually have to do something and she said to me I don't know anybody who thinks that way and I said I think that you may have hit upon the problem there but she never spoke to me again so I now let's talk for just a minute I'm running out of time but I do want to cover that one thing about rape and incest that's always the question that they ask pro-life candidates but they never ask the pro-choice candidates they never say you know are you in favor of aborting a child because it has red hair because that's legal it's you know it's legal to abort a child because he's a Libra instead of a Capricorn so I mean that they never asked him that question but what how many do you know how many abortions are due to rape and incest they the numbers are that one percent of abortion or due to rape and incest and so those who you know there's actually a group called the 1% who are children who have been born out of rape and incest and they say are like our situation justifies the abortion of 99 percent of people and the tragedy is you know those one-percent their value their inherent Worth is not compromised by the circumstances of which they were conceived I mean a lot of us were probably not expected but our parents didn't say oh well you know because I did plan for you and so I think the problem is we have to acknowledge the horror of rape and incest absolutely like that what that does to women is horrific but to try to fix one violence with a second violence is not gonna fix the issue and in fact it just leaves her further wounded instead of really offering help and healing and being able to take that life that she is now carrying and who knows what the potential is for that child just because his father was a rapist does not mean it is going to grow up to be that yeah yeah I'm talking to join a high of the director of strategic partnerships for live action run by Lila Rose I want to ask him one last question yeah I think I think it was Gloria Steinem I won't be hold to that but she had this one of the few things she said that I actually agreed with was that a lot of women believe that abortion is justified in two cases the health of the mother and their personal case and and that was why she believed that abortion rights would never be overturned when you're looking at the future with the stuff live action is doing are you hopeful do you think that this is a fight we're gonna win or not yes I do think it's a fight one a thousand doctors internationally have said that there's no men necessary case for a woman to abort her child or to save life and so you know that argument taken out and then I think once people begin to understand really the humanity of their child and also as we as society come around and support these women then they're not gonna see abortions their only choice they're gonna realize that there's hope and and there's great beautiful things that can come out of this and we're seeing a shift we have one of the most pro-life generations we've ever had in this country you you have slowly the Supreme Court is shifting in the right direction and so I do think it's just a matter of time and education which is what live actions focused on is educating people this generation and the next so that we do shift it and I do believe we're gonna see changes potentially even in my lifetime at the very least for my children Wow from your mouth to God's ears Joanna hiya thank you from live action was really good talking to I hope to see you soon thanks bye well that was that was hopeful I'm all right stuff I like we need stupid sounds for stuff I like there was this thing comes up but it's not as many you know this week I think was this week I talked about the the painting Hylas and the minced by John William Waterhouse it was taken down by the Manchester Museum and I started talking kind of off the top of my head about the pre-raphaelites whom I loved and they were a group in the 19th century in the Victorian era who believed that everything after Raphael lost the richness of the medieval and the Gothic it was kind of it was kind of the Victorian era sentimental version of the romantics they were trying to recapture what was being lost in the Scientific Revolution which was the importance of the inner life of man the the legitimacy and the centrality of the inner life of man and one of my favorites of the of the pre-raphaelites was Dante Gabriel Rossetti and you may know his name because his sister Christina Rossetti wrote the poem she was a wonderful poet and she wrote the poem that became the Christmas Carol in the Bleak Midwinter and if you ever listen to the lyric so that you think like oh wow those are really of another koala that was Christina he was also Dante Gabriel Rossetti he was very connected he was home-schooled and he was very connected to romantic writings so he loved Edgar Allan Poe he loved Lord Byron and he was one of the guys who restored William Blake his posthumous reputation William Blake died without ever having sold I think that can't be right he was completely obscure when he died one of the great English Romantic poets a very strange guy of visionary poet everybody thought he was crazy but Dante Gabriel Rossetti collected his works and kind of restored his posthumous his reputation posthumously he built this began to help build his reputation now in 1850 this is the part I want to get to though in 1850 Rosetti met a woman named Elizabeth Siddal and she became not only his model she ultimately became his wife and she really became one of the models of all the pre-raphaelites I just just put up some of one of the pictures I sent I send in some of them this is her as Proserpina she Prosser Proserpine whatever they called her Proserpina was the daughter of Ceres she was kidnapped by the king of Hades and brought underground and Ceres went in search of her but when she finally recovered her she had already eaten Pluto had given her six seeds of a pomegranate to eat so every six months he had to go back underground and every six months she came back to the top and Ceres who was the God goddess of grain that's how we got the seasons essentially because while she was gone she mourned so there was no grain there was no growth it was winter and when her daughter would come back to her it would be summer and so if you look if you can see it this is Elizabeth Siddal with this incredibly beautiful red hair give me another one another one of the pictures that we put out here she is as a Beatrix who was the muse of Dante who helped guide him to heaven in the Divine Comedy that's of course very meaningful because Dante Gabriel Rossetti shared the name with Dante and so he Elizabeth Siddal was his muse but the most famous painting of Elizabeth Siddal was not done by Rosetta it was done by a Malay John Malay who painted this this is the famous picture of Ophelia the drowned of philia which and Hamlet Queen Gertrude comes in and gives us description of how she gathered all these flowers and then lay there and her dress slowly she was mad and her dress slowly filled with water and then the water carried her down and she was drowned and that again is the beautiful Elizabeth Siddal now these guys were just like most male artists there were terrible people they were constantly on drugs they were constantly cheating on their women and Rosetti was no different this is my favorite story about it's kind of a grim story it's my favorite story about Rosetti and Elizabeth Siddal he he really just treated her badly he cheated on her and he would offer to marry her and then at the last minute he would pull out and she answered this by continually getting sick and he when he finally did marry her they had to carry her to the wedding because she was so sick and won and had lost so much weight but because she was constantly sick she started taking laudanum laudanum was opium it was just like today that you get addicted to opiates she got addicted to opiates and she finally died of an overdose in 1862 now Rosetti was absolutely shattered so when he buried her he buried a journal with her that contained many of his poet's poems because he was also a poet and he's not as good a poet as he was an artist but his poetry became fairly famous she was buried in Highgate Cemetery which if you've ever been to it is one of these wonderful Victorian cemeteries it looks like it's a living ghost story okay but after a while he couldn't stand the fact that he had buried his poetry and some of his friends were creating poetry and they were gaining and famous becoming famous poets and he he wanted to publish some new poems but he didn't have the old mr. Fawlty got permission to dissin tore the body so he could recover the poetry and he was so ashamed of this though he got legal permission to it he went out in the dead oh he didn't go himself he sent his men out in the dead of night with torches and they dug up Elizabeth Siddal and because of the laudanum she was very well preserved oh you'd look and they said that her hair had grown now that actually doesn't happen your hair doesn't grow after you die what happens is you shrink you know you start to shrink so she had that lush beautiful red hair and apparently they up in the torches and all this stuff and they got back but Rianne they published the poetry which was attacked we didn't do very well but they brought out the poetry in the dead of night in this wonderful Victorians like a victorian ghost story Rosetti never got over this he was haunted by this for the rest of his life he was haunted by the guilt of having dug up Elizabeth Siddal and probably by the way he treated her as well but it's a wonderful wonderful story if you've never experienced the pre-raphaelite probably have without knowing it you probably have calendars with them on it but take a look look them up because they are just they just made such beautiful beautiful gothic sentimental but also wonderful paintings that took them took us back kind of into a medieval era with the new techniques that had come along since the Renaissance and they really are beautiful and Elizabeth Siddal was at the heart of many many of their paintings alright enough of that on to the cliven last weekend I'm sorry if you haven't seen another listen to another Kingdom listen to another Kingdom and that will take you through the clayvin last weekend we will end as always with some music you know I never watched the Super Bowl halftime show but I am actually kind of a fan of Justin Timberlake in the release no I'm just number like is if you're remembering was in sync he was one of these boy bands they've always had that kind of like yearning you know the thing where they were singing for twelve-year-old girls and all those but Justin Timberlake actually had talent and he had a sense of humor about himself he's actually grown as an artist so I went listened to the signature the title song of his new album and it's actually he's just good you know and he says it's called man of the woods and he says the whole album was really about his son who is named Silas which apparently means man of the woods anyway we'll we'll end with that I am Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show the Clavin this weekend begins survivors gather here on Monday and I'll see you then the Andrew Clavin show is produced by Robert Sterling executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our supervising producer is Mathis Glover technical producer Austen Stevens edited by Alex zingaro audio is mixed by Mike core Mina hair and makeup is by Jesuit vera and our animations are by Cynthia Angulo and Jacob Jackson the Andrew Klavan show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright for word publishing 2018
