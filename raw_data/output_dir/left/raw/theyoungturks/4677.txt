1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,210
TODAY THE SUPREME COURT

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,519
HANDED DONALD TRUMP AT LEAST A

3
00:00:02,519 --> 00:00:06,930
PARTIAL VICTORY ON HIS MUSLIM
TRAVEL BAND BY REINSTATING

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,230
SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF IT.

5
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:09,500
WE
WILL BREAK DOWN WHAT IS

6
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:21,600
REINSTATED 
AND WHAT IS NOT.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:31,680
IT
MEANS THAT THE COURT CASE WILL

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,100
CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,649
WHAT IS
HAPPENING TODAY IS NOT

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,570
NECESSARILY PERMANENT, ALTHOUGH

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,629
IT IS BAD FOR PEOPLE IT WILL
AFFECT AND THEORETICALLY SETS A

12
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:42,890
BAD PRECEDENT FOR THE FUTURE.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,109
LET'S BREAK DOWN THE SPECIFICS

14
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:58,510
HERE.

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:03,579
NOW AS WE POINTED OUT
EARLIER, BRINGING BACK CERTAIN

16
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,580
PORTIONS OF IT WAS WIDELY

17
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,530
SUPPORTED BY THE JUSTICES.

18
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:21,440
BUT
SOME WANTED MORE.

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,440
I KNOW YOU

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,720
WERE WONDERING WHERE GORE SUCH
CAME OUT ON THIS.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,720
HE WANTED A

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,520
FULL REINSTATEMENT OF THE BAND

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,310
GOING FORWARD UNTIL THIS FALL.

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,000
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE THE
ESTABLISHMENT MEDIA WILL SEE A

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:53,940
CONSERVATIVE WHO IS NOT FOAMING
AT 

26
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:01,210
THE MOUTH.

27
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,210
IN FACT WITH HIS

28
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:06,450
RULING IN A CASE WHERE HE SAID
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO A

29
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,219
CORPORATION AND SIT IN YOUR
TRUCK AND FREEZE TO DEATH, THEN

30
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:16,090
YOU SHOULD BE FIRED.

31
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,790
SO DON'T
GET SURPRISED WHEN GORESUCH

32
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:23,090
VOTES EXTREME RIGHT WING IN

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,360
EVERY SINGLE CASE.

34
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE IF
ANYONE ELSE WOULD'VE WON THE

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,950
PRESIDENCY THEY PROBABLY
WOULD'VE APPOINTED HIM TOO.

36
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:41,760
LET'S LOOK AT THE REST OF
THIS BAN.

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
WHICH IS GREAT FOR THE

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,240
AMERICAN TOURISM INDUSTRY, WAY

39
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,049
TO GO THERE, DONALD TRUMP.

40
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,969
THERE
YOU ARE REALLY LEAVING IT UP TO

41
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,700
A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS THAT
THEORETICALLY COULD ADJUDICATED

42
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,540
IN A MORE OR LESS STRINGENT

43
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,540
FASHION.

44
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,249
THEORETICALLY SOME, IF
THEY HAVE NO CONNECTIONS TO

45
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:09,680
QUESTIONABLE PEOPLE WILL STILL
BE ALLOWED TO ENTER THE COUNTRY,

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,739
ALTHOUGH THAT REMAINS TO BE

47
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:12,379
SEEN.

48
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:16,170
I DID WANT TO SHOW THIS TO
CENK, BECAUSE TRUMP CONSIDERS

49
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,799
THIS A GIGANTIC WIN.

50
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:32,020
NINE ñ O
WITH AN O. LEAVING ME TO HAVE TO

51
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,550
THINK FOR AT LEAST THREE
MINUTES, DOES HE KNOW WHAT THE

52
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,290
O IN 9-0 MEANS?

53
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:43,989
AND I DON'T
KNOW THAT HE DOES.

54
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:53,719
ANOTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE
IS DOES POLITICS MATTER FOR

55
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,290
JUDGES AND JUSTICES?

56
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,400
OF COURSE.

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,599
EVERY OTHER COURT SAID THAT HE

58
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,379
WAS TRYING TO BAN MUSLIMS.

59
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,930
HE
SAID HE WAS GOING TO SHUT DOWN

60
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,220
MUSLIMS WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT.

61
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,499
HE ASKED

62
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:23,180
HIM FOR A WAY TO MAKE IT LEGAL,
BUT IT WAS IN FACT A MUSLIM BAN.

63
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,770
THE FOURTH CIRCUIT LOOKED AT
THAT AND SAID IT IS A VIOLATION

64
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:37,980
OF THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE.

65
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,890
THE
SUPREME COURT LOOKED AT IT AND

66
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,099
SAID I DON'T THINK SO.

67
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,130
THESE ARE
SIX RANDOM COUNTRIES, IT

68
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,890
COULD'VE BEEN NORWAY.

69
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,190
CONSERVATIVES WILL SAY HE DIDN'T

70
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,060
BAN ALL THE MUSLIM COUNTRIES.

71
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,080
YOU KNOW THE ONES HE HAS GOOD

72
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,470
BUSINESS DEALS WITH.

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,490
BY THE WAY
SOME OF THE WORST ABUSERS, 15

74
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:07,450
OUT OF 19 OUT OF THE HIJACKERS
WERE SAUDI'S, BUT THEY CAN COME

75
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,130
BACK IN, NO PROBLEM.

76
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:11,500
CONSERVATIVES TURN AROUND AND

77
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,740
SAY IT MUST NOT BE ABOUT
MUSLIMS.

78
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,539
IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO MAKE
HISTORICAL ANALOGIES ABOUT HOW

79
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:33,199
THEY DIDN'T LOCK UP EVERYBODY.

80
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,330
BUT THEORETICALLY THEY COULD IF

81
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,729
THE SUPREME COURT WERE TO UPHOLD
THIS, THEN SIX CAN BECOME

82
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:46,289
SEVEN, OR 20
OR THE ENTIRETY 

83
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,810
OF THE PLANET.

84
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,220
BECAUSE NATIONAL SECURITY IN
THAT TIME THAT THE BAN HAD

85
00:05:52,220 --> 00:06:09,400
FALLEN APART ñ THE SIX COUNTRIES
INVOLVED HAVE NOT HAD ONE PERSON

86
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,790
FROM THOSE COUNTRIES DO A DEADLY
ATTACK INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

87
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,340
IT WAS BASED ON NO FACTS

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,070
WHATSOEVER.

89
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,430
DO WANT TO KNOW HOW MANY
REFUGEES FROM THESE COUNTRIES

90
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,680
HAVE COMMITTED TERRORIST

91
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,360
ATTACKS?

92
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,050
ZERO.

93
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,930
TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW
MUCH THIS ROLLING MATTERS, THEY

94
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:40,490
ARE GOING TO DO THE FULL RULING

95
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,410
LATER.

96
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,300
BUT THE 90 DAY BAN WELL
ALREADY HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY

97
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,721
EXECUTED BY THE TIME THEY GET TO

98
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:52,139
MAKING A DECISION ON THE CASE.

99
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:53,820
MAYBE EVEN THE WHOLE 128

100
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,270
BAN ON REFUGEES.

101
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:08,979
ANYWAYS, DON'T
WORRY BECAUSE IF THE SUPREME

102
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:13,580
COURT SAYS IT IS OKAY, THE BAN
CAN BECOME INDEFINITE.

103
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,580
SO THEN

104
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,550
WE WILL HAVE AN INDEFINITE

105
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,900
EXCLUSION BASED ON RELIGION, I'M
SURE THAT'S WHAT THE FOUNDING

106
00:07:19,900 --> 00:00:00,000
FATHERS WOULD'VE WANTED.
