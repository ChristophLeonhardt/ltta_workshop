00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">the next eight years all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of that goes</font>

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:16,770
Carolina so I hate to put a little

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,960
pressure on you but the fate of the

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,210
Republic rests on your shoulders I've

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,820
got Republican friends who don't think

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,930
or act the way Donald Trump does this is

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,330
somebody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is uniquely unqualified I</font>

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,488
ran against John McCain I ran against

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,170
Mitt Romney I thought I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a better</font>

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,170
president but I never thought that the

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,390
Republic was at risk if they were

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,129
elected the guy they nominated who many

17
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:48,989
of the Republicans he's running against

18
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,030

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,820
