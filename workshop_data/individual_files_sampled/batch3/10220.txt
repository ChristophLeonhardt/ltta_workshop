Donald Trump has hinted that the Saudi monarch wouldn't last two weeks if it wasn't the US military the US President made that fiery assessment at a campaign rally in the US state of Mississippi but wouldn't give any specifics about a conversation he had with the Saudi King which he referenced in his speech we protect Saudi Arabia would you say they're rich and I love the King King Salman but I said King we're protecting you you might not be there for two weeks without us you have to pay for your military now while US correspondent Samira Khan joins me now Samira thanks for joining us so we're able to delve any deeper perhaps into that comment from President Trump what exactly he meant by that statement well we can guess but considering the arms deals and pulling out of the Iran deal it's clear that the u.s. considers Saudi Arabia to be a major ally and if you remember about a year ago Trump's a first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia but Trump's latest remarks show that there could be some growing contention between the two Trump's been trying to get a Saudi Arabia and OPEC to lower gas prices but some have said that this is Trump's way of securing his party's control in Congress rather than a genuine concern about high gas prices but the intention hasn't been made clear yet but I wouldn't hold my breath
