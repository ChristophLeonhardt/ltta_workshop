how many identity politics can you pack into one tweet well the hill which leans left really raised the bar with regards to identity politics this past week let me read you a tweet from the hill about a Democrat winning a House primary in Kansas this past Tuesday night on August 9th at 1211 a.m. that would have been early Wednesday morning the or actually early Thursday morning the hill tweeted openly gay damn wins House primary would be first Native American woman elected to Congress if she doesn't have a name or maybe openly gay them is her name it's ridiculous how about the woman's name while the woman's name is is Charisse David's and she's a former MMA fighter she is a veteran she graduated from Cornell Law School has an Ivy League law degree but none of that mattered now she's a far left Democrat I'd never vote for this woman but I would I would think that her name the fact that she was a professional MMA fighter the fact that she was a veteran the fact that she has a degree from an Ivy League law school all matter a little bit more then being an openly gay damn and the first Native American woman elected to Congress which by the way has Elizabeth Warren inconsolable because in their attempt to pack as much as many as identity politics as they could in one tweet the hill debunked Elizabeth Warren's claim that she's in fact the first Native American woman to go to Congress so this is this is just great on so many levels then you've got Alexandria Cascio Cortes refusing refusing to debate ben shapiro and a ben shapiro offered Acacio Cortes $10,000 $10,000 he was gonna give it to charity yeah she would debate him Acacio Cortez has had a series of abysmal abysmal showings in the media her mom Nancy Pelosi of speaker await majority that um in the house and the Senate I mean she just sounds dumb every time she speaks well this was Acacio Cortez's reply to ben shapiro offering the donate $10,000 to charity if she would debate him ben shapiro by the way is Orthodox Jewish he's never been remotely inappropriate with a woman on social media and I know Ben not well but there's never even been a whisper a hint that men should be no has ever been inappropriate with a woman so instead of saying to Ben Shapiro I accept your challenge to debate no thank you but I'm gonna politely decline because I feel like the debate is going to be one-sided it's going to be more of a conservative interview than a debate which would've been valid on the part of Acacio Cortes Acacio Cortez took to Twitter and engaged in our own identity politics by saying just like cat calling like construction workers whistling inappropriately a woman in this skirt shoot him right that I paraphrase that second part I don't owe a response to unsolicited requests from men with bad intentions and also like cat calling for some reason they feel entitled to one so now Alexandria kasi acquitted as a Democrat running for the United States Congress in New York is equated a media figure and a very well-known one Ben Shapiro asking her for an interview slash debate to being a demeaned as a woman in other words she took an offer of a debate a request for an interview and turned it into a misogynistic and oppressive overture the Democrats have nothing but identity politics they know these candidates well LoCascio Cortez will probably win because of her district but the rest of their candidates are doomed and they know it so all they have to play are the race cards the identity Paula six cards the virtual signaling car virtual signaling cards and the oppression cards and I really really hope I really hope you Republican voters turn out n mass in November and turn this blue wave that isn't gonna happen into a red tsunami love bringing you these shows gonna do it every day and I do it live every day 7:30 a.m. Eastern on the rebels YouTube channel check it out Monday morning thank you guys thank you so much for watching you have an amazing weekend you
