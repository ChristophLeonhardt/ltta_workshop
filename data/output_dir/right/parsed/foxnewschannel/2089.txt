THAT FIRST PROMPTED THE FALSE
WARNING TO THE GOVERNMENT TO BAT
ON DOWN THE HATCHES AND THAT WAS
THEN, A VERY DIFFERENT
ENVIRONMENT AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE
LOOKING FORWARD TO THOSE TALKS
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND THE
NORTH KOREAN LEADER AS WELL AS
SOME PROMISING DEVELOPMENTS ON
THE RELEASE OF AMERICAN HOSTAGES
HELD THERE, THREE OF THEM THERE
MIGHT BE MORE, DOWN THE ROAD,
THE PRESIDENT HAS YET TO SET A
DATE AND A LOCATION FOR THAT.
HE SAYS HE KNOWS IT WILL SHARE
IT SOON WITH EVERYBODY.
THE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO
THE UNITED NATIONS SO MUCH MORE
BILL RICHARDSON AMBASSADOR GOOD
TO HAVE YOU.
>>  THANK YOU, NEIL.
NEIL: WHO KNOWS BETTER THAN
NEGOTIATING WITH THE NORTH
KOREANS YOU SERVED THAT ROLE
BACK DURING THE CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION.
I THINK YOU SAID YOU HAVE TO BE
CAREFUL VERIFYING EVERYTHING YOU
HEAR OUT OF THEM.
YOU DEALT WITH KIM JONG-UN'S
FATHER, BUT THIS GOES BACK TO
HIS GRANDFATHER AS WELL, THAT
THEY SAY ONE THING, DO ANOTHER,
SO IF YOU WERE TO ADVISE THE
PRESIDENT'S PEOPLE TALKING TO
KIM JONG-UN NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU
TELL THEM?
>>  I WOULD SAY TO WATCH OUT,
THAT HE'S PROBABLY GOT SOMETHING
UP HIS SLEEVE LIKE RIGHT BEFORE
A BIG NEGOTIATION LIKE WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH A SUMMIT.
THE NORTH KOREANS DO A CHARM
OFFENSIVE.
THEY PUT OUT GOOD PRESS
STATEMENTS THIS IS WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO, WE'RE GOING TO
CLOSE DOWN A NUCLEAR FACILITY,
THEY PROBABLY LEAKED THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO RELEASE THE
THREE AMERICANS BEFORE THE
SUMMIT.
YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH THEM AND
YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CONSCIENCE
OF THE DETAILS.
MY WORRY, NEIL, IS THE PRESIDENT
GOES INTO THE SUMMIT AND UNLESS
WE HAVE HAVE HAVE A STRATEGY OF
WHERE WE WANT TO END UP THESE
GUYS ARE VERY SKILLFUL AND
RELENTLESS.
THEY DON'T THINK LIKE US THEY'RE
NOT INTO QUID PRO QUO, THEY
THINK THEY'RE TOTALLY RIGHT, THE
DIVINE RIGHT OF THE FATHER AND
GRANDFATHER AS YOU MENTIONED AND
NOW KIM JONG-UN.
NEIL: ALL RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS
THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS FAVORING
TALKS INTO THE DEMILITARIZED
ZONE, THAT IT'S EASIER, IT'S
PROBABLY BETTER OPTICS, HE
DIDN'T SAY THAT BUT THAT SEEMS
TO BE THE VIEW.
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
>>  NO, DO YOU KNOW WHY, NEIL?
I'VE BEEN TO THAT AREA.
THE WAY YOU MAKE DEALS WITH THE
NORTH KOREANS IS INFORMALLY.
LIKE I HEARD THAT MAYBE THERE'S
GOING TO BE A DINNER OR THEY'RE
GOING TO WALK TOGETHER AND TALK,
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
YOU KNOW, THAT AREA IS TOO
COMPRESSED.
YOU MAKE DEALS WITH THE NORTH
KOREANS AND INFORMAL SETTINGS
AND IN TABLE TO TABLE THEY'RE
GOING TO VENT, WILL VENT BACK
AND FORTH.
NEIL: YOU LIKE PROOF WE WERE
SHOWING THE TIME THAT YOU HELPED
RESCUE AN AMERICAN PRISONER
THERE, BUT YOU WERE BIG ON
SAYING THAT I NEED TO SEE IT
BEFORE I COULD TALK ABOUT IT,
THE SAME WOULD APPLY NOW I GUESS
TO THE RELEASE OF THESE HOSTAGES
, AND ANY AGREEMENT THE
PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY SAID HE'LL
WALK AWAY FROM THE TABLE IF IT
DOESN'T LOOK PROMISING AND BY
THAT HE MEANS WHETHER THE NORTH
KOREANS ARE GOING TO AGREE TO
SOMETHING FIRM AND COMMIT TO
CHECKING WHAT THEY'RE PROMISING
RIGHT?
>>  WELL YOU KNOW I'M NOT A BIG
FAN OF THE PRESIDENT'S TWEETS
AND ANNOUNCING, YOU KNOW, LIKE
ANNOUNCING THEY'RE GOING TO BE
RELEASED SO THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
RELEASED.
THE NORTH KOREANS DECIDE WHEN
THE PRISONERS ARE RELEASED AND I
WORRY ABOUT SAYING WELL I'LL
WALK OUT . THE NORTH KOREANS ARE
VERY SENSITIVE.
DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T DESERVE
THAT SCRUTINY, BUT I JUST WISH
TRADITIONAL DIPLOMACY WOULD
GOVERN THE PRESIDENT'S STYLE,
BUT --
NEIL: BUT LOOK HOW FAR ITS TAKEN
US THIS UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH,
ITS GOT US THIS FAR THE TWO
LEADERS COULD BE TALKING, RIGHT?
>>  WELL THINGS ARE GOING WELL
THE SOUTH KOREAN SUMMIT, THE
OLYMPICS NOW THIS SUMMIT.
LOOK I'VE SAID THE PRESIDENT
DESERVES CREDIT FOR MEETING KIM
JONG-UN, AGREEING SENDING POMPEO
, YOU KNOW, I'M HOPEFUL.
IT'S THE BEST I'VE SEEN IN A
