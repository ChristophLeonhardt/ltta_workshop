laura ingraham we need to apologize the LeBron James much they run their mouths like that remember her Fox News lady who famously told LeBron to shut up and dribble at that point LeBrons I promise foundation had already pledged 41 million dollars which guaranteed four years of college tuition to kids from Akron and I'm sure Laura didn't know that or care when she played the role of the angry white person trying to belittle a black community leader thankfully instead of shutting up and dribbling LeBron put his money where his mouth is and now that same foundation has built a whole ass public school in Akron so last night I watched Laura thinking maybe she'd have the self-awareness or the decency to apologize the LeBron for her statements and boy it was I wrong yeah sure a public school that'll help thousands of at-risk kids great but turns out LeBron still not allowed to criticize the president our president is kind of trying to divide us that he's kind of used sport to kind of divide us this is the statement Laura chose to focus on while covering LeBrons gesture it's a fantastic school for at-risk kids this comment though yeah listen you might have opened a school for at-risk kids in Akron offering free lunches a Food Bank and parental Assistance Programs but have you thought about knowing your place though don't you dare something democra Blee true like the president is dividing our country along racial lines at a time when more Nazis are emboldened to run for public office than ever before and a president who apologizes for Nazis by calling them very fine people at a time when the administration is separating children from their mothers and putting them in cages very sneaky LeBron thinking we'd be fooled by one good deed nope too far this comment though that the president is dividing people with sports I think that goes too far why is it but isn't dividing us looking sports lines people kneel at the at the national anthem Colin Kaepernick did that not the challenge here's what's actually too far gaslighting an entire country first by lying and saying that these athletes are protesting the army and the flag when it's clear they're protesting police brutality when it's a veteran who suggested they kneel in the first place but to Laura they're just ungrateful punks you know what that means a lot of these guys are punks millions of dollars play a game and I can't stand for the national anthem and then to act like Trump doesn't use this as a rallying cry get that son of a the field right now out he's fired is if the president doesn't pull the NFL policy out of his ass every time the Muller investigation moves forward or when he has a bad media day Trump spoke about it but the fans didn't like it this is completely intellectually dishonest Trump has gone as far as suggesting black athletes leave the country that's precisely at the heart of the problem though LeBron can literally build a school that will genuinely better the lives of thousands of kids in Akron but if he dares to say something true about the president that everyone at this point agrees with that is backed by polling data then he's back to just being a bad black athlete who should know his place and keep his mouth shut which is funny because all it takes for you to get on Loras good graces is to be a good black athlete I've never protest during the anthem and I don't think that's the time or the venue to do so if you speak out against the protesters and you're good I adore him he's the new Tim Tebow I love him no matter what you do if you criticize Trump as a black man no less instead of being her doubt you'll be belittled and sometimes you'll even lose your job they'll never listen to your protest not on the field quietly not on the streets and not even in an interview about the future of this country even though you've shown how personally invested you are in the future of this country I'm a somber group there's blatant racism upsets you please share this video with your friends and leave your thoughts in the comment section below also don't forget to download the TYT app for more videos like this and this has been the breakdown
