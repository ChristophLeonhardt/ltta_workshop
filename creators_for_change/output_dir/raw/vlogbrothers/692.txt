00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
Good morning, John

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,680
Good morning, John.

3
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,620
Good morning, Jonathan.

4
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,460
Good morning, John.

5
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,180
Good morning, John.

6
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:05,680
Good morning, John.

7
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,420
PAX was amazing, got a bunch of signed MC Frontalot posters.

8
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,060
Obviously, really overwhelming, really fun to go to a conference that I'm not running.

9
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,760
Got to hang out with a bunch of cool people

10
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,520
and now I'm just doing the thing where I talk about the conference for a second,

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,020
so that I can show a bunch of footage that I took at the conference,

12
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,520
that I wouldn't be able to show otherwise.

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,120
Yes, footage, footage.

14
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,840
Yes, good, that's, yeah, excellent,

15
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,880
uh-huh, that was fun.

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,900
Okay, done with that.

17
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,800
Cause we have to move on,

18
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
there are serious, pressing issues here,

19
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,300
as you can see by the title of the video.

20
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,340
Serious issues!

21
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,540
Lurking just behind Google's front door;

22
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,060
the top questions asked to Google that begin with,

23
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:37,360
"Can you really..."

24
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,260
Number one.

25
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,140
"Can you really sell your soul?"

26
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,040
I don't know why I find this so disappointing.

27
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,780
Are people trying to sell their soul?

28
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,520
Do they think that they have already sold their soul?

29
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
Or someone purchased their soul without them knowing?

30
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Are we in that much debt?!

31
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No, as far as I know,

32
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,480
there is no way to transfer the ownership of a soul from one person to another,

33
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,440
for a variety of reasons.

34
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,120
One of those reasons being that if it were possible,

35
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
you'd see it on Craigslist all the time.

36
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
It'd have its own category.

37
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,620
Two!

38
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,960
"Can you really tip a cow?"

39
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,580
No!

40
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,580
Actually, cows are really big,

41
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,580
really strong,

42
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,640
surprisingly smart animals that sleep lying down.

43
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,880
I'm sure it would be possible to tip a cow,

44
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,500
if you had enough people and in the right situation

45
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
but you can't just run up to one and

46
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
shove it over.

47
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,840
They're massive animals

48
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,260
and I would really suggest against bothering one.

49
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
Because every adult cow in the world

50
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,660
outweighs every adult human in the world

51
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,280
by at least a thousand pounds.

52
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,280
There actually may be miniature cows out there;

53
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,380
I don't know, are there miniature cows?

54
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,980
Let me look it up.

55
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,320
Yeah, of course, there are miniature cows.

56
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,460
What- what was I thinking?

57
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,760
"Can you really curve a bullet?"

58
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,520
No!

59
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,220
Only Angelina Jolie can do that.

60
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,360
It's a genetic thing.

61
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,600
What a terrible movie!

62
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,060
I actually saw it in theatres.

63
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,760
"Can you really make money blogging?"

64
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,480
Yes!

65
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,160
I actually did it for several years.

66
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,920
I paid all of my bills with blogging.

67
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,060
It was really hard.

68
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,280
And now the scene is much more crowded and competitive than it ever was then,

69
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,740
but if you're serious about it,

70
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,500
go to <copyblogger.com>

71
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,840
that guy helped me a lot.

72
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,880
Assasin's creed axe.

73
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,660
Mrrrrr.

74
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,620
"Can you really fry an egg on the sidewalk?"

75
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,120
Yes!

76
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,700
In many places, you can really fry an egg on the sidewalk,

77
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,060
when it's hot in the summertime.

78
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,620
It does not, however, take that much heat

79
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,360
to cook an egg.

80
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,020
But!

81
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,800
Check out this

82
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,180
horrible video

83
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,080
of soldiers

84
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,260
whose boots are melting to the pavement,

85
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,040
in Iraq.

86
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,860
High five to those guys.

87
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,100
Come back soon.

88
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,420
"Can you really die of a broken heart?"

89
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,420
Actually, it's a sad fact, in a manner of speaking,

90
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,260
yes, you can.

91
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,860
Grief is very stressful

92
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,400
and it turns out that people who have recently lost loved ones

93
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
are much more likely to die.

94
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,740
In the 24 hours following the loss of a loved one,

95
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,280
you are 21 times more likely to have a heart attack.

96
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,960
So that means, yes, indeed,

97
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,920
very literally,

98
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,980
a broken heart.

99
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,520
"Can you really get rid of cellulite?"

100
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,700
You can maintain a healthy body weight.

101
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,540
And you can also get expensive plastic surgery

102
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,540
but the creams aren't going to do you any good.

103
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,420
But, really, c'mon,

104
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,680
I think you're gorgeous.

105
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,120
"Can you really get a free iPad?"

106
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,900
Yes.

107
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Uh, you can steal one.

108
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,000
But you are not going to get a free iPad by

109
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,548
taking an online survey,

110
00:02:58,548 --> 00:02:59,048
because

111
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,880
duh.

112
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,160
"Can you really light a fart?"

113
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
Yes, of course, you can.

114
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,000
Farts are composed of many different things,

115
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,920
including methane and hydrogen,

116
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,020
which are both flammable gases.

117
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,160
But I have to suggest

118
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,720
that you do not try this

119
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,740
because it turns out that it's fairly dangerous

120
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,580
to hold an ignition source

121
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,240
up to your flammable pants

122
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,680
and then provide a great deal of fuel

123
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,680
for that ignition source to spread

124
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,000
across the surface of your pants.

125
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
I can't imagine how that could go wrong(!)

126
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,820
"Can you really start a fire with an orange?

127
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,320
This is another viral video,

128
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,680
where some guy filled an orange up with lighter fluid and was like,

129
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,180
"Look! Oranges are flammable!"

130
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,700
They're not.

131
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,860
They're mostly made of water

132
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,060
and water isn't flammable.

133
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,340
Fructose and cellulose are flammable.

134
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,500
And that's- and- but you'd have to dehydrate it first

135
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,640
and then you could light it on fire.

136
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,540
And that's where we'll end it.

137
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,480
Everybody,

138
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,060
don't try to sell your soul,

139
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,580
do purchase iPads-- don't try to get them for free,

140
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,580
stop trying to light everything on fire,

141
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,200
don't worry about your cellulite--

142
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,500
everybody's got it,

143
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,020
and send all your warm, good thoughts

144
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,560
to all the broken hearts out there.

145
00:03:56,000 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see on Tuesday.
