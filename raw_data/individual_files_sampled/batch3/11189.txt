technology and social media Giants have been in the hot seat before US Congress intelligence committees they were being grilled on day two of the hearings into alleged Russian interference in the presidential election lawyers for Twitter Google and Facebook again testified that the amount of Russian linked content on their platforms was relatively small but that apparently wasn't what the Senators wanted to hear I had more than a little bit of frustration I went home last night with profound disappointment all of what the Russians did last year has basically been a free pass in the past election you fail lack of resources a lack of commitment and a lack of genuine effort and that just won't do the key I'd say progress we've made is that's a yes or no once again mr. edge it we think that the key this area is transparency as you might guess I'm really not satisfied with that we have services that that verify identities on the platform why on earth not well the answer is yes or no there I don't want a long explanation sir those let me let me try to say that I would like in writing within a week what you're doing about it we are constantly doing better we all we could we could have done more but I think we are doing more of today and have done more syndication no no no we need to do more mister stretch same is true okay I think there's a lot of political grandstanding going on here people trying to give reasonable answers to some very unreasonable questions but it's not their job and it isn't their job to try to exercise political censorship over content that somebody in the US government or the Congress doesn't like and that seems to be what these senators are faulting these companies for this has nothing to do with any kind of election meddling or interfering with our political system or sowing diversity and casting doubt on our institutions this has to do with the fact that the Senators do not like a source of information and a perspective of information that is not being carried by the mainstream media like CNN the three networks New York Times Washington Post which are essentially organs of the American deep state well to discuss the hearings in more detail are now joined in the studio by artis Daniel Hawkins hi there Dan so what's been going on in Congress then well the hearings are just about rounding up Kate and Twitter revealed finally what exactly is their net if you like for seeing who and what is a Russian linked account it's a pretty wide net that's cast and bearing a mile out of the half a dozen or so criteria only one is needed to be classified as rustling let's take a look at what they had to say we're looking at things like whether they register it in country in Russia do they have a Russian phone number are they on a russian mobile carrier do they have a Russian email address are they coming in from a Russian IP have they ever logged in you'll see in a retrospective work we looked at have you ever logged in at any time from Russia as you can see there's some criteria you would think fair enough others you would think again if somebody's perhaps had a louver at an airport in Russia perhaps logged in or tweeted something they are now classified as Russian link to you and I would certainly be Russia Lincoln of course having worked in Russia but it's also for concern to other journalists as well for example one journalist that BuzzFeed have said look I've opened my Twitter account with a Russian number does that mean I'm now Russia linked potentially in future even a Russian bot now art America host ed Schultz made a comment about the general atmosphere at these hearings and the demeanor of the Senators exactly on the outcomes of some of the testimonies let's take a listen to Ed the unprofessional in completely unfair assessment of this network by the Senate Intelligence Committee is disgraceful I think the unwillingness for these committees both House and Senate to call on any of our employees or this anchor for that matter to testify speaks volumes about their agenda to make excuses for the outcome of the last election now social media internet manipulation has been a hot topic of today something that the Russians have been accused of doing so it's interesting what's come out of the testimonies General Counsel's Sean ediot said that tweets under the hashtag Podesta emails and hashtag DNC leaks if you remember there were two leaks last year that wieder believed to have damaged the Clinton campaign Twitter had hidden their hashtags to limit their availability in searches now his testimony said that between two and four percent of tweets relating to the hashtag had come from Russian linked accounts but Twitter had actually hidden as much as 25% of Podesta email hashtags and 48% nearly half of DNC linked hashtags from searches now Twitter said this was due to automated spam detectors detecting some sort of suspicious activity and banning them from searches as a result that's their version of why that happened although quite why there's that discrepancy numbers of course that's a question that remains to be asked now speculation has also been rife in the House of Representatives hearing that Trump and RT this channel had somehow collaborated last year during the election campaign specifically on the issue of Hillary Clinton's health that somehow they'd perhaps fed information to each other time the release of information to the public etc now a simple look at what was covered by who and when would really reveal that all many of these allegations can be dismissed outright but simply that doesn't seem to have been the case in these testimonies so we've put together a little timeline just to give a little clearer picture here let's take a look I'd like to put up now in candidate Trump ad that included television ads questioning Hillary Clinton's health he also made it a feature of his tweets and remarks this RT advertisement on Twitter pushing the same message about Clinton's health who was mimicking who have they looked at whether the Russians were sharing Trump campaign content former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stumbling as she left the 9/11 commemoration in New York City this morning how much is the campaign gonna stumble voters know it they want a healthy president a president and rude good health well to discuss some of those points now we can cross live to political commentator and journalist John Wright John thank you very much indeed for joining us well we've just seen those tweets by Artie that led to the advertising banned by Twitter but I mean are they really low-quality and inflammatory as they've been described no this this is nonsense it's transparent nonsense and it's in the context of a campaign of anti-russian hysteria that has now become unspeakably deranged and desperate the Russia's presence the presence of RT on Twitter and Facebook has been nothing but normal nothing but part of it's acceptable and normal business of news reporting and Sky News Fox News CNN they all have a presence on social media and they all do so reporting events in other countries to do with their elections or to do with any crises that may emerge in those countries so this is part and parcel of normal news reporting in coverage but in the context of this as I see desperate and deranged campaign of anti-russian hysteria has been used to try and point the finger at Russians the interference and the internal affairs of other countries well as we had Daniel in the studio just briefly I mean he was describing some of the things that Twitter is revealed that they this particular criteria for finding what they call Russia linked BOTS and this could basically apply to any Twitter user not only from Russia but people who've passed through Russia I mean is that not really absurd it's absolutely absurd and it's actually very dangerous because it's starting to identify individuals who may and may have linked to the Internet and Russia that could be passing through a Russian airport as potential Russian agents and this is how ridiculous is it even seems ridiculous saying that but this is where this is headed and unless Western governments and Western ideologues finally wake up to these hysterics that they are engaged in they they are their own course for plunging their own political ideas into the kind of crisis from which there will be no recovery sooner or later they're gonna have to wake up to their own role and the various crises that have engulfed their countries and their political system the support for Scottish independence brexit the election of Trump there is not one scintilla of evidence of Russian state involvement or interference and these events however there is a battery of evidence when it comes to u.s. involvement in those elections in 2014 then US President Barack Obama held a joint press conference with his counterpart they and British Prime Minister David Cameron making his views known that he supported the unity of the United Kingdom he was against Scottish independence in 2016 he was even more forceful in his opposition to brexit he came to London and said that if the British people did vote for Breck's that it would mean that Britain would go to the back of the line in his words when it came to future trade relations with the US and similarly Hillary Clinton did the same when it came to break so when she was a candidate for that year's u.s. presidential election as the NATO general secretary Jens Stoltenberg so when it comes to interference in other countries elections and electoral processes it's the US and its supporters and Western politicians who are guilty of this practice we'll leave it there john white political commentator and journalist thank you for your thoughts
