cultural hegemony is the idea that one culture is pushed and forced all around the world now entertainment you can see this to be true because Hollywood and America as a whole dominates the entertainment all around the world what we put on screen is with everyone else watches the ideas the cultures and the identities that we push out and in the 80s you would think the goal for every man was to stand up and fight the good fight it was to rip your shirt off and just beat your way through every henchman to go save the girl all while shouting yippee ki-yay or I ain't got time to bleed the good old days however if you watch modern movies you think the goal of most American men is to button up your shirt to your chin drink soy flavored water and shut up and do it you're told in all circumstances and unfortunately for the left yet another movie broke this postmodern Marxist stereotype by telling a true story twelve strong is a movie about the horse soldiers in Afghanistan and is also the latest movie condemned for toxic masculinity well let's see what this movie actually promotes and if it's worth a watch I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood this is Jerry Bruckheimer's latest film he is one of the few Hollywood producers that is a conservative opening weekend 12 strong grossed just about thirty five million dollars production budget was not released but do one talk about this movie promotes and the insane critiques that it was given first let's just see how this thing stacks up as a movie my viewer review is a three out of five now this is what I call an intimate war movie for example this is more of an American sniper a lone survivor kind of movie now this means more focusing on one single idea mission or goal now there are also great macro war movies more like Dunkirk or Saving Private Ryan and these focus more on broad storylines in a bigger narrative now all these movies are great but there are specific things each one needs to be good now twelve sterling does have some great intense moments that leave you on the edge of your seat as well as being very beautiful to watch also the stunts and choreography are pretty exciting and being the fact that it's based on a true story gets you invested from the very GetGo I'm also going to start giving performance awards for who I think gave the best performance in a movie and it's well strong I'm gonna give the award to Naveed not gonna happen I hope I said his name right who plays general Dostum now there's some great emotion this movie because you see these men sacrificing everything to go save others including people that are in Afghanistan who are going through absolute Tyranny and horror because al-qaeda has taken over most of the area there's a great kind of underdog push as well because you've these 12 soldiers with these rebel horse soldiers as well they're fighting against 50,000 ik2 terrorists however you do not feel the intimate relationships that you really need for these smaller movies to really land with the audience also there's a strong theme of family here as well as the men wanting to get back to their wives however their wives usually get one or two scenes max because most movie is gonna take place in Iraq so you don't see them as much you kind of forget about them which would've been a really strong emotional pool but because the way the story need to be told you don't have that my critic review I'm gonna give this movie a four out of five I'm gonna score this a little bit higher in this particular category because of the undertaking and telling a true story in the way they did it they had actual people that were involved in this incident including the rebels who are Afghanistan 12 strong is the story of the now Declassified mission which was the first one to take place in Afghanistan which every military mind person says it's an absolutely miracle they pulled this off as now as a statue in New York to commemorate it but as far as the movie goes one of the reasons I'm gonna give this a high critic review is because of the incredible practical effects in this movie there were very few CGI moments in fact I think the only thing I particularly saw that stood out we're rockets being fired obviously you can't get permits to fire miss missiles when you're doing a movie so that was CGI but a lot of the explosions the stuns the horses it was all fantastic to watch it looks great I want to also give it a critic comes up because of how well they tried to follow the story including most the men being on a practice mission when 9/11 happened and finding out about it the lead guy having a desk job before you went to Afghanistan not having any real military experience on the field at that point the incredible relationship between the Afghani rebels and the Americans that work together bearing a piece of the World Trade Center in the soil all these things just added to the story and they did a really good job trying to incorporate that for that two-hour film also fun fact Chris Hemsworth's actual wife played his wife in the movie he jokingly said an interview that they've been rehearsing seven years for this exact part now let's get into the leftist critique of this film the Interceptor wrote quote it's time to wage war against war movies that glorify outdated models of masculinity let's just see who this guy is that wrote this yeah he must be an ally I can see why he's more compatible with the pink hat wearing soy sippin beta male stereotype let's actually take a look at what the values are that are being promoted in this film faith in values I'm gonna give this movie a four out of five maybe he's upset with the values of loving one woman unconditionally and sticking around to raise your family like most of the men in this actual story did and most the men in the actual battle did have lives and family Diamondbacks it many is the value of risking your lives for the sake of others not only fighting for those who had thousands of loved ones ripped from them in 9/11 but also fighting with the Afghan heroes that fought against to take down the Taliban and al-qaeda forces that were tearing a part communities and destroying women and children's lives if you think that scene with the al-qaeda leader of the movie where he tortured and killed a woman for teaching young girls how to read and write do you think that's hard to stomach just look at the UN statistics on the area the average Afghan woman has six children and 85% of women there are still uneducated or illiterate but wait it gets worse MSN reported quote a village council in Pakistan reportedly ordered a sixteen-year-old girl to be raped in front of her own family out of revenge for the actions committed by her brother unquote and keep in mind this is a establish and ordained Council in the community however after the story broke the actual government had to come out and condemn it so yes I would say the values of putting down your life for the sake of others and trying to save other women and people living this community from this insane tyranny even being publicly raped in front of your family because of a crime that your brother committed fighting is that yes I think that is a good value that should be promoted what about the other values like Brotherhood looking out for the one next to you and leaving no one behind do you think any of those are outdated forms of masculinity no I think we desperately need a calling back to it and movies like this do it I mean good lord what kind of form of masculinity do you want to promote it the kind that takes a backseat and since it's okay for communities to do this that all culture should be praised and appreciate it maybe even held in a higher standard than ours that still force women under penalty of law to be completely covered in the middle of the desert or asked to build a drive or not be allowed to vote maybe that's the kind of masculinity this guy wants to promote basically when I see articles and reviews like this that say oh this is not time for this kind of movie or this is not the right America that we want to promote I like to take a step back and think yeah I think I'm gonna go see that one I've been Davies this is pure Hollywood if you like this video and others like it please consider
