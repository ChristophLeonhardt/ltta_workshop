Starbucks CEO has personally met face to face with the two black men who were arrested out of Philadelphia Starbucks last week there's two men were waiting to meet a friend they asked to use the bathroom the store's manager said they had to leave because they didn't buy anything manager called the cops when they refused to leave following the incident demonstrators staged a sit-in and called for a boycott of the coffee giant Starbucks says the store manager quote is no longer at that store I'm joined now by Jason Johnson he is the politics editor at the root calm is also an MSNBC political contributor so Jason as you know these demonstrators into there they're not going to stop this boycott until they see significant change what would that change look like I don't know honestly Craig because I think that when it comes to what happened at Starbucks there are so many instances of this day-to-day racism that people may experience there are so many instances of strange enforcement of rules that only seem to apply to people of color but not other people in the room that I don't know that this particular boycott will necessarily change anything other than that store however if you are a patron of that store if you are a Starbucks customer in Philadelphia then this does have a good impact because at least it tells the CEO that the sort of responses of all we're gonna have a conversation about this aren't enough people need to pay all held accountable people need to be a fired and it needs to be training that tells folks to treat all customers regardless of color with the same spec respecting the same rules Jason and literally the last two minutes since we started this conversation I've been handed a press release from Starbucks the headline Starbucks to close all stores and subject nearly 175,000 of its employees to what it's calling I want to just gonna read it here Starbucks today announced that it's going to closing more than 8,000 company owned stores in the US on the afternoon of May 29th to conduct racial bias education geared toward preventing discrimination in our stores quote I've spent the last few in Philadelphia with my leadership team listening to the community learning what we did wrong and the steps we need to take to fix it this is according to Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson they're gonna close these stores for one day for this training how far do you think that's going to go for Starbucks how far do you think this might go for other companies and institutions out there who might have to deal with something similar to this well I think there's two levels to this Craig number one yeah one day of training is going to be what 25 30 years however old your average manage that there are years of sort of rational implicit bias that we have in this country this should be standard this should be something that you have monthly and how hard can it be to tell your staff members hey enforce the same rules with every customer if you don't let somebody use the bathroom then don't let them use the bathroom without a purchase it doesn't matter if they were black it doesn't matter if they're white it doesn't matter if they're Hispanic so the issue the rules are already in place Craig everyone knows how to treat people properly what's been happening and what we saw in Starbucks and what we saw with the viral video with the the the two black women soldiers in Georgia what we saw with the other video at Starbucks where a woman denied someone being able to use the bathroom and somebody else came out who was white who would not purchase anything is there are no consequences for the people breaking these rules I'm tired of these discussions about training when the issue is a training you don't have to train people to treat someone else nice and with respect but you do have to show them if you don't do it there could be consequences that include losing your job this the Steven goes on to tweet and again we're just getting this in there they're gonna close these stores in the afternoon they're going to be trained employees trained to address implicit bias something that you and I have talked about a fair amount here from a conscious inclusion prevent discrimination and ensure everyone inside a Starbucks store feels safe and welcomed there of course will be skeptics who are going to say this is merely a PR stunt I Craig I don't think it's a PR stunt but I want us to think about this because this is the same thing I say about police officers think of every single city where there's been an instance of police violence and brutality and the city ends up half settle for six seven sometimes ten million dollars rather than just firing a police officer who didn't do their job properly cost the taxpayer six seven million dollars this is going to cost Starbucks who knows how many hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars to shut down their stores for an entire day for an entire afternoon because you had one employee who didn't know how to do their job fire that employee tell everybody if we catch you doing something like this you get fired and they could save themselves with money at some point people are gonna realize racism cost money discrimination cost money and firing people is a much better solution than just having another training Jason Johnson we will leave it
