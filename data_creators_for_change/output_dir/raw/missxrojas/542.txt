its quality its quality entertainment

43
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,689
keep saying quality today I really don't

44
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what the main thing that was talked</font>

45
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,450
about was a book that I finished reading

46
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,759
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> blood red snow white in my</font>

47

pants got this<font color="#CCCCCC"> has just blood red snow</font>

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,490
white by marcus sedgwick and it was out

49
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">in july last year and i think was out in</font>

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,329
march or May or something in the US

51
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,460
marcus sedgwick is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

52
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,920
renowned author of junior fiction

53
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,560
technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 to 12 and he worked quite</font>

54
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,960
well received but my sword hand was

55
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,610
singing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one quite a lot</font>

56
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">of stuff but I started this today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

57
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:02,340
finished<font color="#CCCCCC"> this today I have to do a</font>

58
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,590
number of things between my starting and

59
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,820
my finishing but it didn't detract from

60
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,200
it whatsoever this is basically the

61
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,419
story<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked Arthur Ransome who was a</font>

62
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,610
journalist

63
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,010
in Russia but who you probably know if

64
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,260
you've heard of him<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as the author of</font>

65
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,610
swallows and amazons and that whole

66
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,940
sequence and old Peters Russian tales i

67
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,470
think it's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's part love story</font>

68
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's part political it's completely</font>

69
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,520
based around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Russian revolutions and</font>

70
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,860
the war and everyone was feeling at that

71
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,500
time it's got spying and it's just it

72
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,360
was really brilliant and it's in three

73
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,640
parts all these different voices mixed

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,780
up together at the same time not just

75
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,430
three different voices just all these

76
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,630
different life is not a fairy tale

77
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,730
aspect you've got the first person third

78
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,920
person it's just brilliant brilliant

79
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,300
good with different points as different

80
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,209
places and it's funny you feel like he's

81
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,760
pushing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the limit its kind of trying new</font>

82
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,950
styles of writing and I thought it was

83
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">really brilliant and I I regretfully had</font>

84
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,650
to put it down at about eleven o'clock

85
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,690
this morning to you know say goodbye<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

86
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,400
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> sister but I I was very very sad</font>

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">about having to put it down and it's</font>

88
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:07,010
funny as well because the way that

89
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:10,130
iphone another most books is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

90
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,840
a connection and great feel some empathy

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,709
with the main character or one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

92
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,030
protagonists whatever watch them

93
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,200
constantly where's this one it would

94
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,630
kind of you your sympathy group with one

95
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,489
side and then that was flipped over and

96
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:23,840
then you simply grew with another side

97
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,790
that was flipped over it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely</font>

98
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,489
brilliant you I think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> rude it was</font>

99
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:32,480
so good it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so so good that yeah</font>

100
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,790
it was impressively reminding me lot of

101
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,730
the books<font color="#E5E5E5"> teeth of the red necklace by</font>

102
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,190
Sally Gardner and also slightly the

103
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,480
general his labyrinth as well and that

104
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them taking a factual figure and</font>

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,660
just like weaving fiction around it now

106
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,549
also the thing about Garth Alice was

107
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,150
that am I after making<font color="#CCCCCC"> that video as</font>

108
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,940
people concert saying that that actually

109
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't written by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 Road ruggedized and</font>

110
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,410
interestingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has completely</font>

111
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,630
changed the way I felt about the book

112
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">because what I found amazing while</font>

113
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,400
reading it was the fact that someone

114
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,010
could be so honest the diary<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

115
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,590
I've written a good Jules review I lied

116
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to my diary all the time i embellished</font>

117
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,680
things exaggerated feelings and hugely

118
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,380
selfish about it and then that

119
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,240
she didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem to you and the voice was</font>

120
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,540
slightly different but think about it

121
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,940
gained from perspective that it wasn't

122
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,370
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 15 year old random anonymous</font>

123
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,090
drug addict who wrote it it just makes

124
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,760
it seem completely different it's it's

125
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,950
false and it's unrealistic and it's I

126
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,360
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> find it really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting how much</font>

127
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,930
the background of an author or the time

128
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,050
it set and whatever completely affects

129
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,180
the way I perceive the way I<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy MIT</font>

130
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">shadows I was kind of intrigued</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by them</font>

131
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,170
Oh blog TV I meant I meant to do that

132
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,030
last week yeah but Friday's that lead

133
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,770
him up and then I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really in the</font>

134
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,550
mood so to be honest it's probably the

135
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,020
pretty spontaneous I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to</font>

136
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,660
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this I'm not I'm you know</font>

bunch of his one of those things that I

138
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,020

<font color="#CCCCCC">cuz I'm putting those people we're</font>

140
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,280
completely random crap pops up at the

141
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,250
time and I have to do that I know I want
