1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,080
THERE IS AN IMAGE FLOATING
AROUND THE HAS KIND OF COME TO

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,430
DEFINE PEOPLE LEARNING ABOUT
THE HOUSTON HURRICANE,

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,610
HURRICANE HARVEY.

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,080
THIS IS A PHOTO YOU MAY HAVE
SEEN.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:17,640
IT IS PEOPLE AT AN ASSISTED
LIVING CENTER.

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,430
IN CASE YOU CAN'T SEE IT THERE,
THERE IS WATER COVERING

7
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:22,430
EVERYTHING.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,910
THERE ARE SENIOR CITIZENS SITTING IN
WATER.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,750
IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW I CAME
TO BE, WHAT IT IS.

10
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,750
IT

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,100
IS A SENIOR CENTER RUN
BY TIMOTHY MCINTOSH'S MOTHER.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,010
HE RECEIVED THAT PHOTO FROM
HER AND THEN DIDN'T HEAR

13
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:38,469
ANYTHING FROM HER AFTER THAT
ACCORDING TO TIME MAGAZINE.

14
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,649
FOLLOWING THAT, HE TWEETED IT
AND THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF

15
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:44,891
PEOPLE WHO RETWEETED IT AND
WITHIN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT

16
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:48,510
OF TIME THANKFULLY, FOLKS CAME
TO THE AID ACCORDING TO THE

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:01:05,600
REPORT IN TIME.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,520
THE MACINTOSH'S REACHED OUT TO
TELL PEOPLE THEY WERE GRATEFUL

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:23,229
FOR THE SHOW OF SUPPORT, SAYING:

20
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:24,659
VERY TOUCHING STORY.

21
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:30,670
I OFTENTIMES COMPLAIN ABOUT
HOW TERRIBLE TWITTER IS AND HOW

22
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,469
DETRIMENTAL SOCIAL MEDIA CAN BE,
BUT HERE IS ONE OF THE FEW CASES

23
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,470
WHERE IT LITERALLY SAVED LIVES.

24
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:41,620
LOOKING AT THAT PHOTO, IF YOU
REALLY FOCUS ON EVERY SINGLE

25
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:45,530
PERSON FOR A MINUTE IN THAT
PHOTO IT IS KIND OF AMAZING

26
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,970
BECAUSE IT ALMOST SEEMS AS
THOUGH THEY ARE JUST LIVING

27
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:53,659
THEIR LIVES AND THEY ARE NOT
SUBMERGED IN WATER, ALMOST

28
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:54,659
COMPLETELY SUBMERGED.

29
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,259
I AM SO HAPPY THAT PEOPLE
STEPPED UP AND DID

30
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,259
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

31
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,290
I'M GLAD THAT THE PHOTO WENT
VIRAL AND NO ONE DIED AS A

32
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,880
RESULT OF THAT FLOOD IN THAT
ASSISTED LIVING CENTER.

33
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,510
IT IS JUST TERRIFYING TO ME TO
THINK OF FAMILY MEMBERS WHO

34
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,940
MIGHT BE IN THAT CONDITION AND
MIGHT NOT GET THE HELP THAT

35
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,430
THEY NEED TO SURVIVE.

36
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,520
LOOK, WE DO COMMENTARY ON THE
STORY SO I'M GOING TO.

37
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,580
I NEED YOU TO CALM DOWN.

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,420
IT IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT
POLITICAL.

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,690
THE ISSUE IS GOVERNMENT.

40
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,880
BECAUSE OF THEIR TALKING
POINTS FROM THE RIGHT THAT

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,750
GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS BAD.

42
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,960
BIG GOVERNMENT IS BAD BY
DEFINITION.

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,500
MY COUNTER TO THAT IS, DOESN'T IT
DEPEND?

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,730
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING?

45
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,290
IF AMERICA IS INVADING

46
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,060
A COUNTRY THAT DIDN'T INVADE US,
YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S TERRIBLE.

47
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,280
OR GETTING INSIDE OUR
UTERUS, TERRIBLE.

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,900
SHOULDN'T GET BETWEEN US AND OUR
DOCTOR.

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,260
SOMETIMES CONSERVATIVES DON'T
AGREE WITH THAT.

50
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,050
BUT IF IT IS GOING TO THE
RESCUE OF THESE POOR WOMEN AND

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,330
OTHER PEOPLE IN THAT ASSISTED
LIVING CENTER, IT IS WONDERFUL.

52
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,820
IT IS NOT TO SAY THAT THAT
PROVES THAT GOVERNMENT IS

53
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,030
GREAT ON EVERYTHING.

54
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,490
NO, WE ARE NOT AS
BLACK-AND-WHITE AS THE

55
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,510
RIGHT WING.

56
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,200
WE ARE NOT AS SIMPLISTIC AS THE
RIGHT WING.

57
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,680
IT DEPENDS.

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,580
SOMETIMES GOVERNMENT DOES
WONDERFUL THINGS.

59
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,760
SOMETIMES IT DOES HORRIFIC
THINGS.

60
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,940
LET'S USE OUR MIND AND JUDGMENT
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH IS

61
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,290
WHICH IF WE HAD HAD MORE
GOVERNMENT ACTION, MAYBE WE

62
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,110
WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH CLIMATE
CHANGE AND THE STORMS WOULD

63
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,040
NOT OF BEEN A SEVERE AND THEY
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THIS

64
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,420
MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

65
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,980
IF WE FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME OF
THE REGULATIONS THAT OBAMA

66
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,240
PUT INTO PLACE TO PREVENT
FURTHER FLOODING IN CITIES

67
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,360
LIKE HOUSTON, MAYBE THE FLOODING
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS BAD.

68
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,980
AND CERTAINLY I HOPE WE CAN ALL
AGREE THAT RESCUING PEOPLE IN

69
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,560
NEED IS A CORE GOVERNMENT JOB.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,830
LOOK, ON THE OTHER HAND FOR
DEMOCRATS WHO SOMETIMES

71
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,370
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AND GO
GOVERNMENT IS ALWAYS GREAT.

72
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,370
NO.

73
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,000
WHEN THE POLITICIANS ARE LEGALLY
BRIBED BY THEIR DONORS, IT

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,840
IS NOT GREAT.

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,040
LET'S USE OUR MINDS ENTER
JUDGMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW

76
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,920
MUCH GOVERNMENT WE NEED AND
IN THIS CASE, THANK GOD

77
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,970
SOMEBODY SHOWED UP.

78
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,830
THESE ARE THE WEIRDEST
FEELINGS TO GO THROUGH

79
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,260
BECAUSE YOU SEE SUCH DEVASTATION
ACROSS THE BOARD.

80
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,529
HOUSTON IS Ã±

81
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:21,009
THAT IS WHAT MY GREATEST FEARS.

82
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,730
FLAT SPACE IN A FLOOD.

83
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,130
HOUSTON IS A FLOOD PRONE
DISTRICT.

84
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,390
BAYOUS, DITCHES.

85
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,240
ONE OF OUR EDITORS IS FROM
HOUSTON AND SHOWED ME A

86
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,250
PHOTO OF A GIANT FREEWAY THAT
LOOKS LIKE A RIVER.

87
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,670
IT WAS LIKE A RIVER BECAUSE
THERE WAS A LITTLE BRIDGE

88
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,010
ABOUT THIS HIGH OVER THE WATER
TO LOOK LIKE YOU COULD TAKE

89
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,010
A NICE LITTLE WALK.

90
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,690
NO, THAT'S A FREEWAY IN THE
BRIDGE IS SUPPOSED TO BE

91
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,560
TALL ENOUGH SEE YOU CAN DRIVE A
SEMI TRUCK UNDERNEATH IT.

92
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,250
IT IS TERRIFYING.

93
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,260
AND THEN YOU SEE THESE
GRANDPARENTS WHO ARE IN AN

94
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,810
ASSISTED LIVING CENTER THAT
THEY THEMSELVES NEED ASSISTANCE.

95
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,640
IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THAT THEY
GOT OUT OF THERE BUT THAT

96
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
IS A NIGHTMARE TO ME.

97
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
I WANTED TO MAKE THIS POINT
WHEN WE DID THE ORIGINAL

98
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
STORY ABOUT THE HURRICANE, BUT I
DID NOT GET AN OPPORTUNITY

99
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
SO I WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT
NOW.

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,900
THERE IS ALSO AN ISSUE OF HOW
INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT IN

101
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,990
THE HOUSTON AREA.

102
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,400
THERE IS THIS GREAT WRITER FOR
THE HOUSTON CHRONICLE.

103
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,860
HIS NAME ESCAPES ME AT THE
MOMENT BUT HE TALKED ABOUT HOW

104
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,860
RIGHT NOW THERE IS
OVERDEVELOPMENT IN THE HOUSTON

105
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,100
AREA WHICH IS FLOOD PRONE.

106
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,810
THAT
UNFORTUNATELY MAKES FLOODS WORSE

107
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,880
AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE
THERE ARE GRASSY AREAS,

108
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,400
PRAIRIES, THINGS LIKE THAT THAT
ARE BETTER AT ABSORBING THE

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,639
WATER AND NOW, THERE IS SO MUCH
OVERDEVELOPMENT, PEOPLE ARE

110
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:36,340
BUILDING CONCRETE OVER AND
OBVIOUSLY, CONCRETE DOESN'T

111
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,740
ABSORB THE WATER.

112
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,560
IT MAKES THE FLOODING WORSE AND
SO INSTEAD OF ADDRESSING

113
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,070
THAT, THERE ARE LAWMAKERS IN
THE STATE THAT CONTINUE TO

114
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:50,420
DEREGULATE CERTAIN ZONING LAWS
THAT LEAD TO THIS KIND OF

115
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,800
SITUATION GETTING WORSE AND
SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT

116
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,450
EVERYONE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND.

117
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,060
CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXASPERATING
THE ISSUE.

118
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,230
ABSOLUTELY.

119
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,480
THE UNWILLINGNESS TO BUILD
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT COULD

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,990
WITHSTAND THIS TYPE OF FLOODING
IS A PROBLEM AND THEN THIS

121
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,980
TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT
ACTUALLY MAKES THE FLOODING

122
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
WORSE IS A PROBLEM.

123
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,620
I REMEMBER WHEN INCONVENIENT
TRUTH CAME OUT A DECADE AGO

124
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,610
AND THEY SHOULD THE POSSIBILITY
THAT SOME MAJOR AMERICAN

125
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,420
CITIES WOULD BE UNDERWATER AND
CONSERVATIVES LAUGHED.

126
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,990
THAT IS RIDICULOUS, THEY ARE NOT
GOING TO BE UNDERWATER.

127
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,610
AL GORE, YOU ARE NUTS.

128
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,830
ONE OF THEM WAS PARTICULARLY
ABOUT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.

129
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,790
IN AN INCONVENIENT SEQUAL
THE SHOWED THE MEMORIAL

130
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,790
WAS UNDERWATER.

131
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,540
NOW HOUSTON IS UNDERWATER.

132
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,100
IT
HAS HAPPENED TIME AND TIME

133
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,350
AGAIN, NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA
THERE WAS THE BIGGEST FLOOD

134
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,110
THEY HAD EVER SEEN LAST YEAR.

135
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,630
THIS IS NOW BEING CALLED A 500

136
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,630
YEAR FLOOD.

137
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,050
I'M BEGINNING TO
THINK IT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY

138
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,980
500 YEARS, IT HAPPENS OFTEN
AND REPEATEDLY BECAUSE THE

139
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,450
STORMS ARE GETTING WORSE BECAUSE
OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

140
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,990
IT TURNS OUT THE SCIENTISTS WERE
RIGHT ALL ALONG.

141
00:07:00,990 --> 00:00:00,000
BIG SURPRISE.
