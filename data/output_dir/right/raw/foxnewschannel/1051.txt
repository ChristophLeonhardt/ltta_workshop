1
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:13,782
>> Laura: LU HOLDS A GRIDIRON

2
00:00:13,782 --> 00:00:14,817
LEGEND AND A MEMBER OF THE

3
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:15,517
COLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME.

4
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,620
HE HAS COACHED IN THE NFL, THE

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:20,055
SEC AND GUIDED NOTRE DAME TO A

6
00:00:20,055 --> 00:00:23,425
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP IN 1988.

7
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:25,060
ALSO WRITTEN OR CONTRIBUTED TO

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,195
TEN BOOKS.

9
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:28,597
BUT TONIGHT HE JOINS US TO

10
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:30,633
DISCUSS ISSUES AT THE

11
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:31,800
INTERSECTION OF SPORTS AND

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,235
POLITICS AND HAS BECOME SO

13
00:00:33,235 --> 00:00:33,702
PREVALENT TODAY.

14
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,804
COACH, IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

15
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,072
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

16
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:40,209
>> I'M DELIGHTED TO BE WITH YOU,

17
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:41,310
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SUCCESS

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:41,744
OF YOUR SHOW.

19
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:43,812
>> Laura: THANK YOU SO MUCH,

20
00:00:43,812 --> 00:00:44,413
COACH.

21
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:47,583
THIS HAS BEEN SO WILD FOR ME TO

22
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:49,218
WATCH WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

23
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:49,585
FOOTBALL.

24
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:50,986
I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A

25
00:00:50,986 --> 00:00:52,521
FOOTBALL FAN MY WHOLE LIFE, MY

26
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:56,225
MOTHER WAS AN ALABAMA FAN,

27
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:57,026
SORRY, COACH.

28
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:58,727
WHICH I INHERITED, NO PARTICULAR

29
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:02,398
REASON, JUST LIKE BAIRD BRYANT

30
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:04,599
AND IT WAS ALWAYS VIEWED WITH

31
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,735
PATRIOTISM AND LOVE OF COUNTRY,

32
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:08,437
AND WE ARE NOW AT A PLACE WHERE

33
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:13,008
AN INVITATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE

34
00:01:13,008 --> 00:01:14,410
TURNS THE SUPER BOWL CHAMPION

35
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,211
INTO A PUDDLE OF GOO.

36
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:17,212
THEY ARE DEBATING FOR WEEKS HOW

37
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,414
TO HANDLE IT.

38
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,783
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY

39
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:21,517
WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTR

40
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:21,850
COUNTRY?

41
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,186
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I WAS

42
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:25,220
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO TAKE A

43
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,422
FOOTBALL TEAM TO THE WHITE HOUSE

44
00:01:26,422 --> 00:01:27,823
AND IT WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST

45
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:28,991
EXPERIENCES FOR ALL OF OUR

46
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:29,591
PLAYERS.

47
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:32,294
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO EARN

48
00:01:32,294 --> 00:01:33,028
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BY PLAYING

49
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:35,230
PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL, BUT I

50
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,266
THINK THAT WE GET FOULED UP AND

51
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:38,334
WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE.

52
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:40,969
THE ONE THING THAT I TOLD OUR

53
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,205
TEAM WAS THAT WE WOULD NOT USE

54
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:45,374
OUR FOOTBALL TEAM TO PROMOTE

55
00:01:45,374 --> 00:01:46,442
ANYTHING EXCEPT FOR THE

56
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:47,276
UNIVERSITY OF THE

57
00:01:47,276 --> 00:01:47,943
PHILADELPHIA EAGLES OR THE

58
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:48,377
NEW YORK JETS.

59
00:01:48,377 --> 00:01:50,179
IF YOU WANT TO PROMOTE A CAUSE

60
00:01:50,179 --> 00:01:52,014
USE YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY,

61
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:52,448
THAT IS FINE.

62
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,116
BUT THE LOCKER ROOM BELONGS TO

63
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:54,717
THE PLAYERS OF THE NFL.

64
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:57,319
THEY CAN SAY WHAT EVER THEY

65
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:57,619
WANT.

66
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,355
FOR THE FOOTBALL THEME AND TEAM

67
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:02,624
ON THE FIELD BELONGS TO ME.

68
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,226
WE ARE HERE TO WIN THE

69
00:02:04,226 --> 00:02:04,626
SUPER BOWL.

70
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,195
NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.

71
00:02:06,195 --> 00:02:08,030
I DO NOT WANT ANY OTHER

72
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,997
DISTRACTION EXCEPT ONE FOCUS, I

73
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:10,833
CONGRATULATE COACH PETERSON ON

74
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,735
WHAT A TREMENDOUS JOB, HE LOST A

75
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:14,236
GREAT QUARTERBACK AND STILL

76
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:15,037
MANAGE TO WIN THE SUPER BOWL.

77
00:02:15,037 --> 00:02:16,672
I'M PROUD THAT HE WAS LOOKING

78
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,040
FORWARD TO GETTING TO THE

79
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,441
WHITE HOUSE AND IT IS

80
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,576
UNFORTUNATE OF THE PLAYERS DO

81
00:02:20,576 --> 00:02:22,044
NOT GET THAT EXPERIENCE.

82
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:22,878
>> Laura: HIS QUARTERBACK WAS

83
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:24,113
ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE THAT

84
00:02:24,113 --> 00:02:25,881
WANTED TO COME TO THE

85
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:27,316
WHITE HOUSE ALONG WITH COACH WHO

86
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:28,217
WANTED TO COME AS WELL.

87
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:31,020
BUT THEY DID NOT MAKE THE TRIP.

88
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,658
ANOTHER COACH FROM THE NBA,

89
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,993
COACH CARE FROM THE GOLDEN STATE

90
00:02:37,993 --> 00:02:39,995
WARRIORS MADE THIS POINT ABOUT

91
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,196
PATRIOTISM AND DONALD TRUMP.

92
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:41,597
LET'S WATCH.

93
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:42,865
>> THE PRESIDENT IS TURNING THIS

94
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:49,004
INTO A POLITICAL GAME.

95
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:51,407
IT IS A BLATANT DISPLAY OF

96
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:52,942
NATIONALISM, WE HAVE THESE

97
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:54,610
MILITARY SING-ALONGS AT THE

98
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,210
WHITE HOUSE TO SHOW HOW

99
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,378
PATRIOTIC WE ARE EVEN THOUGH WE

100
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:58,614
DO NOT KNOW THE WORDS.

101
00:02:58,614 --> 00:03:00,015
IT IS JUST INCREDIBLE.

102
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:00,516
IT IS INCREDIBLE.

103
00:03:00,516 --> 00:03:02,284
BUT I AM REALLY PROUD OF PEOPLE

104
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,619
IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE

105
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,221
RECOGNIZING WHAT IS HAPPENING

106
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:07,623
AND INSTEAD OF TURNING THIS INTO

107
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:08,157
A POLITICAL GAME --

108
00:03:08,157 --> 00:03:09,659
>> Laura: HE WENT ON TO SAY

109
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,193
THAT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THEIR

110
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:13,562
CONSCIENCE, BASICALLY THAT HE IS

111
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:14,864
A COACH FOR THE WARRIORS.

112
00:03:14,864 --> 00:03:19,835
>> LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, WHERE IS

113
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,370
GOLDEN STATE IS OUT AROUND

114
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,104
SAN FRANCISCO, THAT IS PROBABLY

115
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:24,006
THE VIEW OF MOST PEOPLE.

116
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,608
I AM AN INDIVIDUAL, I REMEMBER

117
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:27,009
WHEN MY FATHER WENT TO THE

118
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:27,743
PACIFIC FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS

119
00:03:27,743 --> 00:03:29,879
AND I NEVER SAW MY FATHER FOR

120
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,380
FIVE YEARS, BUT FORTUNATELY HE

121
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,747
CAME BACK.

122
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:33,716
MANY CHILDREN'S FATHERS DID NOT

123
00:03:33,716 --> 00:03:34,417
COME BACK AND THEY PAID THE

124
00:03:34,417 --> 00:03:36,986
ULTIMATE SACRIFICE.

125
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:38,688
I'VE BEEN TO AFGHANISTAN, LAST

126
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:41,824
JUNE I WAS IN KOREA, GO INTO A

127
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:42,658
HOSPITAL IN AFGHANISTAN TO SEE

128
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:43,859
PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR LEGS AND

129
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,761
THEY STILL HAVE THE LOVE OF THIS

130
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:47,797
COUNTRY, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

131
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:49,599
POLITICS, THEN THAT IS WHAT IS

132
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,166
COMING INTO THIS GAME.

133
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,834
IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN

134
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,003
SOMETHING, AND I THINK THAT IT

135
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:54,837
COMES BACK TO SAYING THAT

136
00:03:54,837 --> 00:03:57,607
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A RACIST, I

137
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,842
GET TIRED OF HEARING RACIST,

138
00:03:59,842 --> 00:04:01,611
HOMOPHOBIA, FOR 77 YEARS HE DID

139
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:03,213
BUSINESS, THERE WAS NEVER A

140
00:04:03,213 --> 00:04:04,881
CLAIM ONE TIME ABOUT HIM BEING A

141
00:04:04,881 --> 00:04:05,815
RACIST.

142
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:07,450
I WAS IN DETROIT YESTERDAY, BEN

143
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,419
CARSON, WE WERE TRYING TO DO

144
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,821
SOME THINGS FOR THE DISADVANTAGE

145
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:12,422
YOUTH, PRESIDENT TRUMPS

146
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:14,357
LEADERSHIP, THEY HAD A SIGN THAT

147
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:21,865
I THOUGHT WAS GREAT, SAID TALENT

148
00:04:21,865 --> 00:04:22,565
EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE

149
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:22,866
WORLD.

150
00:04:22,866 --> 00:04:23,366
OPPORTUNITY IS ON.

151
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,034
LET'S WORK TO GIVE PEOPLE AN

152
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:24,434
OPPORTUNITY.

153
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:26,369
PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE.

154
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:28,838
BUT BEFORE THIS YEAR IN THE

155
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:30,407
PREVIOUS YEAR, LOOKING AT IT AS

156
00:04:30,407 --> 00:04:33,209
ABSOLUTELY INSANE, BECAUSE WE

157
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,278
HAVE A PROBLEM, BECAUSE WE HAVE

158
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:36,012
A DIFFERENT OBJECTIVE.

159
00:04:36,012 --> 00:04:37,814
WE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF

160
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:39,015
OPINION OF HOW TO MAKE AMERICA

161
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:40,817
GREAT AND HOW TO GIVE PEOPLE AN

162
00:04:40,817 --> 00:04:42,819
OPPORTUNITY AND HOW TO WIN A

163
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,253
CHAMPIONSHIP.

164
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:44,788
COACH STEVE KERR HAS DONE A

165
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:46,222
GREAT JOB.

166
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:47,257
HE ALSO WON SEVERAL

167
00:04:47,257 --> 00:04:48,425
CHAMPIONSHIPS WITH HIS PLAYERS.

168
00:04:48,425 --> 00:04:49,659
CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT, BUT

169
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:52,595
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT A POLITICAL

170
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:54,965
STATEMENT, READ STEVE KERR'S

171
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:55,632
COMMENTS, THAT SAYS IT ALL.

172
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:56,700
>> Laura: WHAT THEY ARE SAYING

173
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,202
IS THAT THE PLAYERS ARE

174
00:04:59,202 --> 00:04:59,970
FOLLOWING THEIR CONSCIENCE ABOUT

175
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,470
POLICE BRUTALITY.

176
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,772
IT IS NOT ABOUT THE COUNTRY OR

177
00:05:02,772 --> 00:05:04,607
THE FLAG, THEY ARE VERY

178
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,476
PATRIOTIC PEOPLE, BUT THEY ARE

179
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:09,012
IN THEIR OWN WAY PROTESTING

180
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:09,679
AGAINST POLICE BRUTALITY AND

181
00:05:09,679 --> 00:05:10,647
THEY THINK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

182
00:05:10,647 --> 00:05:11,881
DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THAT SO THEY

183
00:05:11,881 --> 00:05:14,617
DO NOT WANT TO SPEND TIME WITH

184
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:15,385
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

185
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:16,619
>> I THINK WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

186
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:19,189
SAID THIS MORNING WAS GREAT, HE

187
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,991
SAID YOU TALK ABOUT POLICE

188
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:21,791
BRUTALITY AND POLICE BEING

189
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,193
UNFAIR, BRING IT TO ME.

190
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:24,027
