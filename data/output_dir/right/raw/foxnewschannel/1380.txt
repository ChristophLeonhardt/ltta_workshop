1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:04,800
MORE CONSERVATIVE NEWS CHANNEL.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,101
STEVE.

3
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:06,068
STEVE: THANK YOU.

4
00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:09,538
BACK WITH US IS KENNEDY AND

5
00:00:09,538 --> 00:00:11,774
CANDACE OWEN.

6
00:00:11,774 --> 00:00:16,579
ARE WE MAKING TOO MUCH OF SHOWS?

7
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:19,548
>> I THINK IF YOU RELY ON THE

8
00:00:19,548 --> 00:00:23,285
POLITICAL WORLD VIEW OF JIMMY

9
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:31,861
KIMMEL OR STEVEN COBERT YOU WILL

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,697
LEAVE OUT HALF OF THE COUNTRY.

11
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:36,565
NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE

12
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:36,932
POLITICAL.

13
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:40,136
NOT EVERY SITCOM HAS TO BE

14
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:40,503
POLITICAL.

15
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:43,105
IF THERE IS A STRIPE THAT'S

16
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:46,008
SHOWN IN THIS FORUM, THEY ARE

17
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,444
NOT ALL GOING TO BE LIBERAL.

18
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:50,880
HALF OF THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY

19
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,380
ISN'T.

20
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,482
THEY MAY HATE EACH OTHER BUT

21
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:57,119
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME

22
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,419
THING.

23
00:00:57,419 --> 00:01:02,892
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO

24
00:01:02,892 --> 00:01:07,496
TAMP DOWN ROSANNE'S POLITICAL

25
00:01:07,496 --> 00:01:07,797
FIRE.

26
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:12,535
SHE TWEETED BACK NO, YOU ARE

27
00:01:12,535 --> 00:01:12,802
NOT.

28
00:01:12,802 --> 00:01:13,803
STEVE: CANDACE, IN TERMS OF THE

29
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:15,471
PEOPLE RESPONDING TO YOUR

30
00:01:15,471 --> 00:01:18,474
MESSAGE AND MOVEMENT YOU ARE

31
00:01:18,474 --> 00:01:19,275
BUILDING.

32
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:23,212
WHAT IS THEIR TAKE ON THE MEDIA

33
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:23,579
LANDSCAPE.

34
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,681
DO THEY HEAR WHAT THEY BELIEVE

35
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,518
REFLECTED IN THE CULTURE OR NOT

36
00:01:29,518 --> 00:01:30,286
REALLY?

37
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:31,020
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

38
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,955
CULTURE USED TO PROVIDE THE

39
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:34,657
WINDOW INTO THE HEARTS AND MINDS

40
00:01:34,657 --> 00:01:35,357
OF PEOPLE.

41
00:01:35,357 --> 00:01:36,692
IT NO LONGER DOES.

42
00:01:36,692 --> 00:01:40,129
IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE BEING

43
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,164
PUNISHED FOR NOT AGREEING WITH

44
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:44,366
THESE HOSTS AND PLATFORMS.

45
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,968
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE STARTING

46
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:47,903
TO TURN IT OFF.

47
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:51,941
WITH THE REVIALS YOU SEE PERSON

48
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:54,076
PEOPLE SAYING THANK GOODNESS

49
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,978
SOMEONE IS STANDING UP FOR MY

50
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:59,148
IDEAS AND WHAT I BELIEVE IN.

51
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:01,550
IF THE MEDIA DOESN'T DO

52
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,185
SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.

53
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:12,695
IF THEY DON'T STOP SELLING THE

54
00:02:12,695 --> 00:02:15,297
STORY INSTEAD OF PROMOTING IT

55
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:18,567
THEN PEOPLE WILL TURN IT OFF.

56
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,169
STEVE: IT'S WEIRD HOW IT'S BEEN

57
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:22,771
SO OVERWHELMINGLY ON THE LEFT.

58
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:26,475
YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THEY

59
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:30,179
COME IN REBELLING AND THAT'S A

60
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,080
LIBERTARIAN MESSAGE.

61
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,216
IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY AN

62
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:36,118
ASSUMPTION THAT THE MUSIC

63
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:38,220
INDUSTRY ARE ON THE LEFT.

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,223
>> A LOT OF TIMES, I'M NOT SURE

65
00:02:41,223 --> 00:02:44,326
IF YOU ARE HEARD OF FREE MARKET

66
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:47,263
LYRICS, THEY ARE BORING.

67
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:48,163
[ LAUGHTER ]

68
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:49,798
>> WHEN THEY WRITE THESE

69
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:52,234
POLITICAL SONGS, THEY ARE PRETTY

70
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:52,534
AWFUL.

71
00:02:52,534 --> 00:03:01,310
I WOULDN'T NAME NAMES.

72
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,646
YOU WILL FIND THESE THEMES IN

73
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:05,581
COUNTRY MUSIC AND SOMETIMES A

74
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,284
BETTER VENUE FOR STORY TELLING.

75
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,619
THERE ARE SOME LIBERTARIANS IN

76
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,755
MUSIC AND SOME THAT FIGHT BACK.

77
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:16,058
WHEN I SAY WHEN KANYE PRAISED

78
00:03:16,058 --> 00:03:19,028
CANDACE OWENS I DON'T DOUBT THE

79
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:28,904
SEN

80
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:28,938
HIN

81
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:33,609
HIS REALNESS BUT HE REALIZED HE

82
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:34,977
WAS SUPPRESSED.

83
00:03:34,977 --> 00:03:36,812
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE THE

84
00:03:36,812 --> 00:03:41,550
PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO EXPRESS

85
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,485
INDIVIDUALISTIC THOUGHTS THAT

86
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:46,722
MAY DIFFER FROM THIS INSIDIOUS

87
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:48,924
GROUP THING.

88
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,460
IT'S SMOTHERING THOUGHT AND

89
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,928
ARTISTRY.

90
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,697
>> CANDACE, LAST WORD TO YOU ON

91
00:03:54,697 --> 00:03:54,997
THIS.

92
00:03:54,997 --> 00:03:57,132
THAT WAS WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO

93
00:03:57,132 --> 00:03:59,335
THE KANYE REACTION TO WHAT YOU

94
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,035
SAID.

95
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:02,371
IT WASN'T ENDORSING EVERYTHING

96
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:04,206
YOU ARE ARGUING FOR.

97
00:04:04,206 --> 00:04:06,442
HE SAID HANG ON A SECOND LET'S

98
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:08,043
JUST SAY WHAT WE THINK.

99
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:10,179
THAT'S A FOUNDATIONAL THING WE

100
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:11,513
SHOULD AGREE ABOUT.

101
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:14,950
THAT'S THE MOST YOU CAN EXPECT

102
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,553
FROM THE CULTURAL AND

103
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:20,656
ENTERTAINMENT WORLD?

104
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:21,824
>> EXACTLY, KENNEDY HIT THE NAIL

105
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:23,625
ON THE HEAD.

106
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:25,127
ARTIST THINK THEY ARE FREE BUT

107
00:04:25,127 --> 00:04:26,996
THEY ARE NOT.

108
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:29,565
KANYE SAYING THIS FIVE WORD

109
00:04:29,565 --> 00:04:32,201
TWEET SHOWS HOW NOT FREE THEY

110
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:32,501
ARE.

111
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:36,538
YOU WILL BE SHOCKED HOW MANY

112
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:39,675
ARTIST AND ACTORS HAVE WRITTEN

113
00:04:39,675 --> 00:04:41,610
TO ME THAT SAID THEY SUPPORT ME

114
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,846
BUT THEY ARE SCARED TO DO SO

115
00:04:43,846 --> 00:04:44,213
PUBLICLY.

116
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:47,583
THERE IS A PRISON THAT EXISTS IN

117
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:47,950
HOLLYWOOD.

118
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:51,120
THERE IS A MENTAL PRISON.

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,056
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO EXPRESS

120
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:55,057
THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEIR JOBS

121
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:56,458
ARE ON THE LINE.

122
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,327
I ALWAYS COMPARE IT TO BEING GAY

123
00:04:58,327 --> 00:05:02,765
IN THE 80s.

124
00:05:02,765 --> 00:05:05,267
STEVE: IF YOU KEEP GOING I THINK

125
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,569
THOSE PEOPLE BIT BY BIT WILL BE

126
00:05:07,569 --> 00:00:00,000
ABLE TO COME OUT IF WE CAN USE
