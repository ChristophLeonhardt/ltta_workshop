hi I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report up here in Toronto Canada Stacy's here a bunch of geese are here and they're like I don't think geese quack but they go honk they honk the geese are honking and it's almost hockey season Stacy I think they're honking at those boats out there on the water they don't like them hanging around we're still in Canada that's a Canadian goose or do you say geese that's one goose over there it's loose many geese are a gaggle of geese we're on this theme we're heading into the midterm elections in the United States we're here reporting from the front line to see if many more Americans might threaten to come here and they're certainly building a lot of property so there's plenty of space for you here but I'm looking at the US economy because my belief is that Bill Clinton was right it's the economy stupid and that's what people and that's what voters care about some you know if you if you prefer that it's actually a conspiracy theory and that people are going to vote on what Putin thinks then you could tune into em MSNBC you're free to do so and go there and and and and yes ways your you know discomfort with the economy over there but I'm gonna look at some numbers that have been out this week in the United States which are pretty shocking in light of the what seems like global chaos with the emerging market currencies with you know trade wars all sorts of stuff NFIB small business sentiment climbs in july to second highest level in history the National Federation of Independent Business small business optimism index rose point seven points in July to a hundred and seven point nine the NFIB said it was the second highest level in history in just under the 1983 peak remember 1983 was right before Reagan won his landslide in 1984 into his second term I think that was the year that that happened eight of the ten components legit plans to increase employment expectations for rising sales and for expansion increased those for current inventories and plans to increase inventories to kind the single most important issue flagged by small businesses were concerns about the quality of labor with a net twenty three percent saying so they're finding it difficult to find people to work you know the unemployment rate is down the labor participation rate is high so this goes against all the doom mongers before the election to trump and and of course nobody in mainstream media wants to focus on this because it belies their conspiracy theories small businesses and that's where most jobs in America come from small and medium-sized enterprises these are you know mama pop businesses these are family-owned businesses these are the voters of America in the heartland that are very much hated right now in the US mainstream media but they're feeling good the feeling optimistic so you know if you're if they're tuning into MSNBC and CNN and only hearing that there's an evil plot out to look like we have a Manchurian president maybe they're like well you know what things haven't been this great since Reagan for us maybe we like the president that is a Manchurian won so maybe that's the way to go so I mean this is how their conspiracy theory could backfire on them oh it's definitely backfiring and the 2018 election she'll probably not hurt Trump and he's good to go in 2020 simply because he's a change agent as I've been saying since just before the 2016 election he needs somebody to come along and drain the swamp as he says he's firing some FBI crooks he's revoking the credentials for CIA people that have long gone then they just leaked to the press for some ill-gotten gains and he's draining the Swope that's what we've want him to do it doesn't even matter my argument is it doesn't matter what crazy political tweets he sends it doesn't matter who he fires or anything like that or what his insiders all these people recording him secretly that doesn't matter if people are feeling optimistic if the next headline Americans are spending like crazy at restaurants spending at US restaurants surged over the past three months by the most on record making it both a bright spot for the economy and a risk if appetites for eating out return to normal sales at food service and drinking establishments that they on an annualized basis it's up twenty five point three percent yeah Rachel Maddow is there saying how dare you get a job American how dare your wages go up how dare you go out and spend money in a restaurant don't you know I have a wacky conspiracy theory that was told to me by my corporate overlords to increase ratings about Putin interfering with the election how dare you well her ratings are going up and maybe you know that's what she's always gonna focus on but she may be surprised when the voters don't vote based on her conspiracy theory because voters tend to vote on their pocketbook they tend to vote on how much gasoline costs they tend to vote on how much their mortgage rates costs they tend to vote on how good they're feeling one would think it looks like Americans are feeling pretty good if they're going out to restaurants and the data in this article shows that they're spending more than they normally do so people seem to be feeling positive and happy and optimistic despite what you would think tuning into the mainstream corporate media here is an apocalyptic situation in which you know fleeing to Toronto is one of your only solutions right well how come Mark Zuckerberg has been suspended Rachel Maddow's Facebook page she's clearly a propagandist and she's clearly trying to wriggle X I personally think it's disgusting and horrid and horrible that people want Mark Zuckerberg to shut down Facebook pages because I think he has a monopoly on the one of the public squares of our internet age and he should not be allowed to shut down these Page clearly but so let's talk about the economic situation and what people might be voting on rather than the conspiracy theories because if you know I don't want to go too much into the conspiracy theories you MSNBC is 24/7 conspiracy theory you can go there if you want to delve into those but I'm gonna look at some of the data that might impact more the election results coming up in 2018 but most importantly in 2020 this is a tweet from Ryan Cooper the average family premium for employer sponsored insurance is up 55 percent since 2007 average worker contributions up 74 percent that's what it looks like on a chart since 2007 remember at 2008 Obama became president we introduced Obamacare things were supposed to get better and cheaper for us in fact premiums went up for McCarroll recipients and employer these are employer sponsored so the average contribution per household is down five thousand seven hundred and fourteen dollars Thatcher famously said the problem of socialism is you eventually run out of other people's money the problem with this system is that these health care companies are going to eventually not have any more money to steal taurine extort so they are going to topple over when they've stolen all the money there's no more money to steal people might be voting on this instead it was never been looked into on the US mainstream media that I've seen there are some great people online who write blog posts who do research into Obamacare and health care premiums you and I were in North Carolina and right before the November 2016 elections Obama care prices rose by 44 percent just two weeks before the election that has never been discussed and the mainstream media about a possible reason for people voting in a certain way and I'm gonna look at another article that also could just to show you the importance of what you know you and I have talked about how people will kick the elite and the teeth to destroy the system if they don't feel that they're getting something so I'm also looking at like how what people will do what extent they will do just to have a job just to have community just to feel wanted and and participate in a society Japan's prisons are a haven for elderly women every aging society faces distinct challenges but Japan with the world's oldest population twenty seven point three percent of its citizens are 65 or older almost twice the share in the US has been dealing with one it didn't foresee senior crime complaints and arrests involving elderly people and will women in particular are taking place at rates above those of any other demographic group almost one in five women in Japanese prisons is a senior their crimes are usually minor nine and ten senior women have been convicted or found guilty of shoplifting senior prison kabuki that's a growing market now this is incredible that the senior citizens in Japan the women are seeking companionship essentially by shoplifting and being in prison Bloomberg interviews a lot of these women and what they found was that yes a lot of them were just lonely half the were impoverished because there you know the cost of rent and all sorts of things were too expensive for them to afford so they were provided with the meals and the stability but there were some remarkable things including one woman who said she had a wealthy husband and she wasn't lonely she had a child or two they were obviously grown up because she was in her 80s but she said that she you know she was arrested a few times and then the first time she was in prison she had for the first time in her life a job and she had never had a job because you're put to work in prison so she loved having a job so her husband wouldn't let her work and she was in her 80s so nobody would hire her so she shoplifted again to get into prison in order to have a job so here what I'm saying is like when you look at the US landscape and you look at places in Michigan or Wisconsin or Phil in Sylvania where people used to have good jobs and now they don't you know the fact that the mainstream media can't comprehend that they would vote for somebody like chocolate they personally despise you know the people in the media like if somebody's willing to go to prison for a job what you know what are they likely to do in a voting booth for a job remember Obama's election and reelection strategy was to give people a free phone the Obama found you know welfare give people free stuff because that he comes from a welfare background Trump's strategy was to give people a job you know people want a job they don't want free stuff people want that Cedars talking about these elderly Japanese women there's a lot of self-satisfaction that comes with working so Trump says you can get to work and we can give you a sense of purpose in life in America it would give you a job Obama's like you have no you know you didn't make anything he said famously we're actually just a Maoist kind of communist dictatorship we're gonna give you a free phone so you can click on Facebook and make them rich well actually I might say that free phone program started under Reagan so it was something that has been for poor communities to keep them connected but it did work like Fox News I think branded an Obama phone and when we were talking to a bunch of homeless people in Cambridge Massachusetts they themselves referred to it as their Obama phone so is it well Reagan famously got yeah also of course we have the system in America where we incarcerate most of our you know a lot of the african-american population and poor people we just put them in prison it costs forty four thousand dollars a year to incarcerate a person but it's the same thing in Japan it's adding up the costs are adding up neither the government nor the private sector has established an effective rehabilitation program for seniors and the cost to keep them in prison are rising fast expenses associated with elder care helped push annual medical costs at correctional facilities past six billion yen which is more than 50 million dollars in 2015 an eighty percent increase from a decade ago specialized workers have been hired to help older inmates with bathing and toileting during the day but at night these tasks are handled by guards right debt-to-gdp of any country in the world over 300% and we'll come back after this break but remember that the opiate companies drug companies killed 58,000 last year 72,000 that's the Vietnam War only killed like 50,000 think about that the opiate pushing drug companies kill more last year than we lost in Vietnam thanks opiate drug companies we'll be right back after this break welcome back to the Kaiser report on mass geyser time now to turn to Ryan Taylor he's the CEO of - core group I guess it is Ryan that's right okay welcome to the Kaiser report thank you it's great to have you on great to be here yeah - is a very important element in the whole cryptocurrency space they invented I believe the master node system am i correct that's correct a master node system just for people might not be familiar is that the miners instead of just all the mining outcome going into one specific pocket let's say the miners it's split in two in your case of - three categories one category is the miners one category is the Treasury and then one category is the what's the third category the third category is the master notes the master notes themselves and then the masternodes get to vote on how to spend that Treasury that's correct so you've got like a governance thing baked into the cake that's right and the thing about - is that it's got this Treasury and it's remarkable in a lot of ways and the most remarkable thing that's happening right now and the reason we got John is what's happening in Venezuela can you tell us what's going on yes so we're seeing a large amount of adoption taking place in Venezuela it's grown to become our second largest market and really the reason that we're seeing that type of growth is of course because of what's happening with the Bulevar they're expecting a million percent inflation this year in Venezuela and this is kind of the the prime example of a broken fiat currency and what what the Treasury system allows the community there to do is to organize and to fund a lot of their activities and so we have conferences being held there by community members funded by that Treasury we have help desks that people can call in to merchants can call in to for help with their wallets we have physical offices that people can walk into and in a small group setting get set up with a wallet and learn how to use it and we have boots on the ground out there selling to merchants this concept of accepting digital currency and so what we've seen is over 200 merchants a month - except - in Caracas and other cities throughout Venezuela and it's incredible we now have nearly 900 merchants in Venezuela accepting - and the number is just continuing to grow and grow and we're even seeing this extend into neighboring Colombia where a lot of Venezuelans are living and are able to send money back home using - and so it's just an amazing grassroots efforts that's taking root and it wouldn't be possible without the funding from the network itself to make it happen right and you know with - it's an interesting solution to payments you know there's a raging debate in the Bitcoin space is Bitcoin is it a store of value is it a medium of exchange and there's a war going on and they there is a Forex of Bitcoin going on it's all very confusing for most people - you know correct me if I'm wrong but it said you know what let Bitcoin be a store value where we want to focus on payments you know we want to get the stuff into people's hands the - wallet app is you download it in ten seconds and you're like you're ready to go you're rocking a roll and you're dashing all over the world and so it kind of solves that payments issue and but if you bring in two people of Venezuela something they've probably never had which is hard money yeah crypto money so you know you are really on the vanguard if I what would I would think would be you know Satoshi Vision I mean you guys are doing it that's right we're seeing actual adoption one of the data points that I look to is the number of transactions on the network and that's usually highly correlated with the market cap but what we've seen lately is that in this environment where market cap is falling across the entire ecosystem we're actually seeing our transaction counts go up at the same time that we're seeing more and more merchants adopt it and so I believe what we're seeing is much smaller value transactions on our network and more frequent transactions on our network that is real-world use and that is you know what we're all here to see happen and so yeah it's it's happening and I think - is really well positioned for Venezuela in particular because it we have in Inc transactions 97% of all transactions still occur in the real world not online and we have small fees our median transaction fee is about a tenth of a cent and so it that matters to people in Venezuela they're living on dollars a day right and also in the remittance market that's huge because there are remittance intermediaries that's the big names that people know of they charge 10 15 20 percent to send a hundred bucks you're saying that you can send value over the over the network for a tenth of a penny or something yeah right at that point the cost just doesn't matter right it's very so low that it's an extra 10 bucks in somebody's pocket yeah what's you for living on a dollar day that's $10 that's 10 days of life yep right I mean this is this is game changing world changing his life changing technology right so your transactions are going up even though the price across the whole crypto space is down so that must be actually quite for you kind of good to see because there's a perception that the there's nothing good about crypto except price speculation and certainly in the mainstream media or a columnist and in the New York Times would say it's just price speculation that's the only thing this thing is good for but here you now you've got a price dip but - network transactions are improving or they're going up right yeah I mean even accepting other digital forms of payment in Venezuela use accept a credit card transaction there the money doesn't hit your account until three days later and it's worth about 20% less during that time that's a huge fee to be able to accept digital form of payment and so with instant transactions they get money that they can spend right away at the next merchant and it's far more stable than going down 20% every week let's talk mercs an adoption because that number is going up quite sharply isn't it yes so at the beginning of the year we had around 50 merchants in in Venezuela we're now at nearly 900 the beginning of a year on a website that tracks our merchants adoption we had around 250 worldwide we're now up to around 22 2,300 merchants worldwide and so we've seen enormous growth you know quadruple or quadruple digit growth rates and merchant acceptance in the last year it's incredible to see okay now I know as the CEO of - core that your focus is on execution and operations and technology and you know you don't want you know you're not you're not gonna get into the politics do too much but in Venezuela obviously it's a political situation going on there yeah so how do you deal with that the community there is really a grassroots effort and so I we don't have to get directly involved and there's advantages to that we can focus on that execution component as you mentioned I think ultimately as peer-to-peer technology this would be very difficult for the the government to censor in terms of transactions there hasn't been any indication from the government that they are unwilling to allow this to occur the services that are provided down there continue to operate they haven't been approached in any way so they're just continuing to push forward and try to add value to people's lives I think it'll reach a tipping point where people won't accept not being able to use it I think that you know people have a real need to solve their immediate problems of feeding their families and and there comes a point when they're just willing to do anything to embrace something that's going to fix this problem for them yeah when you talk about this you know it reminds me Stacy and I were in Egypt in Cairo during the revolution that took place there they called the the Facebook revolution at the time because the technology was used to organize protests and that revolution against the leader of Egypt at that time and it was technology used in a way that the government never saw coming and they this is everything everyone knows the history of this but they have no currency to go with it right so all over the world you have populations that feel like they want to improve their situation and they feel mired in maybe a situation that they're not able to control much and but having hard money which crypto is gives them a leg up on the possibility of organizing a true revolution do you feel as though that is a revolution in that sense is it is there a political revolution a and number two if it is there a possibility of contagion are we gonna see a global crypto hard-money revolution Ryan I think that having hard money that his peer-to-peer certainly introduces a great deal of financial freedom to people that don't enjoy very much financial freedom today whether it is that their currency itself is broken and therefore all payment systems are effectively broken in their in their environment or whether it is restrictions on the way that they can use their money this really addresses that and then I think on the second point I'm unsure to be honest I think that in places like Venezuela where there's a strong motivator I think we'll certainly see that type of adoption whether other communities or other countries see that much value and and the transition costs associated with transitioning to a new system of money it's not without disruption and so I think they have to see the value their question is can we communicate that value and demonstrate that value to the point that entire countries are willing to you know take the plunge right revolution in the air so well with that of course the masternode system is a revolution the way that's all been set up and so walk us through that again you know a full disclosure of course the - masternodes voted in the show that we did here on Rt last year a great American pilgrimage and we had a lot of fun with that and cross country and we spread the gospel to America hopefully we that came off to everyone's satisfaction but Khitan walk us through you know how that masternode works again because that really is the secret sauce I think aside from the excellent technology right the way that the Treasury system works is that 10% of our block reward is set aside for what's called a monthly super block it's essentially out monthly budget anyone is free to put a proposal up to the network that says here's what I want to do and here's what I'm asking for in order to go do that and the master owns themselves vote on those the highest-ranking proposals pay out first until that treasury budget is gone so at the end of the month a snapshot is taken of those votes the highest-ranked proposals pay out first and really anyone with a good idea it doesn't have to come from - core group or some centralized entity right anyone can participate in this - core group gets its funding in this way and can put a proposal up to the network now in Venezuela they identified this need and they identified the specific needs that people needed to be on board in Venezuela they needed education they needed conferences and things to learn about it they needed incentives to sign up merchants they needed customer service these are the things are required to actually see this get adopted and so they put forward those proposals they got voted in and we're seeing a great deal of success with it and now those same groups are putting forward more and more proposals to enhance what they're doing their grow their teams expand the ecosystem and so it really is a system that feeds upon itself and allocates funding towards where success is being seen it seems awfully democratic it's perfectly democratic and and it's more like I liken it to being a shareholder if you own one or more masternodes you get one or more votes in proportion to you know the amount of - that you hold and so you know it really is shareholder activism exile stakeholder activism it's like invisible democracy instead of all the posturing and speech making about what we'll do if I get elected it's like here's the treasury let's all figure out how to spend it right now and everyone's life better today exactly and unlike a shareholder of a company that gets to vote once a year on who the board of directors are that make all the decisions they have much more control over the immediate decisions on a month to month basis right so it's real-time real-time democracy Ryan all right we're out of time you want to get a - wallet it's easy just go to - wallet on your phone and there it is and you can fricking get involved right away thanks for being on the Kaiser well thank you for having me all righty take care well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me max Kaiser and Stacy Herbert I want to thank our guest Ryan Taylor he's the CEO of the - core if you want to reach us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
