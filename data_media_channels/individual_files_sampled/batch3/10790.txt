hi this is max keiser this is the Kaiser report the show that drives people crazy because we drop so many truth bombs bang bang bang max there's been so so so much happening in the world a lot of the news understandably missed a pretty significant story that might one day in history look much bigger than it did the week it happened and that is explainer China aims to challenge Brent WTI oil with crude futures launch the launch of China's yuan denominated oil futures will mark the culmination of a decade long pushed by the Shanghai Futures Exchange SH Fe aimed at giving the world's largest energy consumer more power and price and crude oil sold to Asia so some are saying the petro yuan is here and it's here to challenge the petro dollar yeah we've been waiting on this for a long time because we're talking about the dollar fact that its world reserve currency countries are tired of funding America's wars because everything's got to be traded in dollars including oil do you buy oil got to buy dollars first and that means America gets a commission and they use that money to wage wars all over the world people are tired of it they're tired of war they don't want to subsidize war no more so China's saying you know what here's the weak point it's this dollar we're gonna introduce the petro UN and we're gonna take over pricing of oil and we're gonna forget well I mean you could position it as a conspiracy theory however it could be more so the conspiracy theory people die every day I know but it could just be a practical part of becoming part of the global monetary and economic power China is on a purchasing power parity the number one economy in the world without adjusting for purchasing power it's the number two behind the u.s. so at some point they do have to you join the game and allow their currency to float it's not convertible at the moment it's you know it's it's they control the exchange rate so at one point they will need to provide more liquidity to global markets there's no more market in the world perhaps gold is the closest as to oil so if right now it's all treated in US dollars and that's why every country in the world doesn't mind having a huge surplus of dollars on their books because they could use it to buy oil but you know it could just be China I'm just playing devil's advocate here to conspiracy theories because a lot of people say this is like a direct challenge and I think it is a challenge it will ultimately be perhaps they get the exorbitant privilege one day in a world of fiat but here it could just be a practical thing of how to you know how to make your currency part of not only the SDR the IMF Special Drawing rights but also a global reserve currency well why does China nee Dollars and why do they sell stuff to the US for dollars like into Walmart because without dollars they're incapable of participating in the global economy since it's all priced in dollars so to escape the yoke of being colonized by a dollar based economy they would seek to escape possibly through the UN petrol dollar contract as a expression of economic freedom so this is something that we see in other countries Russia for example is coming up with an alternative to the Swift money transfer system they don't want to be colonized by the American dollar Swift system they wanted their own system so all these countries that are emerging now it's multi trillion-dollar competitors to the US economy need to figure out the dollar question or they will remain a colony of the US well one thing of course that also happened is when Trump was threatening all sorts of tariffs on steel and an intellectual property six billion dollars with trade tariffs on there is that one there are many people in the Communist Party of China and one official did say oh we might not buy any more US Treasuries they didn't threaten to dump them but every single financial and economic analysts on earth said of course China is kind of stuck in a quagmire because they hold so many US dollar Treasury bonds and what are they going to do they're just going to ruin their own position so this is also a way to not have to accumulate even more US dollars on their books because they need to diversify their portfolio because they're right now you know they're not diversified they're hopefully giving up this symbiotic relationship that people thought was unimpeachable and unbreakable between these two but China is signaling that maybe it is breakable that maybe they will attempt to go it alone so let's look at some of the risks that Reuter says the people are concerned about and I'm just going to pick up on one matter that you are a special guest on because it's about market making and market structure and price discovery and things like this and one of the issues they point out that people are concerned about is that the Shanghai International Energy Exchange the unit of the Shanghai Futures Exchange running the contract has strict daily limits on the number of canceled orders allowed per account aimed at curbing spoofing this involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell futures contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution by creating an illusion of demand spoo furs can influence prices to benefit their market positions for a larger client placing orders of more than 300 Lots equivalent to 30,000 barrels of oil the limit is 50 a day users with smaller orders are allowed 500 cancellations that's different to international exchanges like the CME which it uses a ratio based on an investor's traded volume so they're actually targeting spoofing this is a matter we've talked about for many years a lot of people who look at commodity markets in the West point to spoofing in many of the markets including from the high-frequency traders right well spoofing is a way to defraud markets and if China is a party that wants to get the u.s. defrauded to defraud a China trader from coming from China they would use spoofing to defraud them and to steal their money so China's saying okay we want to be in this market and we don't want to be defrauded anymore we don't want to have our money stolen the way it's been stolen by the CMA for years and years with impunity so we're gonna introduce our own contract and we're gonna bring integrity to that contract to do some anti-spoofing tweaks to the way that these contracts are traded and that'll become probably a lot of popular very popular contract because a lot of people don't want to have their money stolen by the CMA you know that's a common thread again well with markets of course blockchain technology could be used to remove a lot of this fraud rather than going through a complicated regulatory measures but another thing that some people are concerned about in terms of the the shank of this new Shanghai Futures contract is that you know the Western markets are pretty much 24/7 in oil but this will this particular contract though they won't be open 24/7 and also what will happen during China's national holidays well trading will stop for China's week-long national holidays both the Spring Festival and Golden Week leaving the Shanghai market out of sync with the Western exchanges shorter trading hours with just three slots each day compared with almost 24 hours on Western exchanges means that the market may sometimes play catch-up with the rest of the world so there is a bit of an arbitrage and a weird it seems like it might be kept more chaotic if they're competing we see that within the Bitcoin market Bitcoin is 24/7 and then you have currency markets and gold markets shut down over the weekend and you see this huge catch up or you see ETFs or something like the Gold Barry Silbert gold ETF that on the weekends if the price of Bitcoin falls by 15 20 percent then you know somebody in gbtc can sell until my morning yeah yeah berries Bitcoin DTF yeah that's true they are gonna have to expand the hours of trading I think they need to roll it out slowly they're gonna do it on a limited basis and then they've got to go 24/7 for those very reasons within a year they will be 24/7 and before I know people will leave comments is not gbtc is not an ETF but it's close to it it's structured similar to it but who will use the domestic industry they asked in this article in Reuters well China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts including the country's oil majors and about a hundred and fifty brokerages ten foreign intermediaries have registered including JP Morgan bans financial straits financial services and other Hong kong-based affiliates of domestic brokerages it will likely attract however mainly mom-and-pop speculative investors who dominate the country's other often volatile commodity futures markets from dates to iron ore through although transaction fees for crude are relatively higher so they're predicting it's going to be the mom and pops speculating on this well they have enormous buying power and they do affect prices on the margin we know we know in Japan for example the mrs. Watanabe the housewife prototype archetype is the one who drives pricing in that in those markets and Forex so here you've got an enormous population online traders who can on the margins you know move prices up and down so this is an enormous population of many hundreds of millions of traders by the way foreign investors can participate you have to open a non-resident bank account so if you want to compete with the mom-and-pop speculators in China you're welcome to go there apparently but you know they mentioned JP Morgan and I want to turn to this headline and it shows again I had just mentioned blotching and what sort of transparency blockchain could introduce to these commodity markets because JP Morgan has this massive silver position and everybody's talking about it but do they really have a massive silver position we don't know however here's a headline from zero head and it's regarding John Butler who is a well-known a commodities guy and he's written many books and does a lot of research while silver prices to surge JPMorgan has acquired a massive quantity of physical silver JP Morgan continues to accumulate the biggest stockpile of physical silver in history JP Morgan now holds more than 133 million ounces more than held by The Hunt Brothers according to John Butler silver horde owned by JP Morgan has increased from zero once's in 2011 to one hundred and twenty million ounces today money managers showing more optimism towards silver through record buying near impossible to rule out an upside price surprise at any moment this is from marco burns gold court outfit and they were posting on 0 hedge oh so we need to get into this with some of the excess you know David Morgan he's a guy who would know yeah I think we're gonna talk to him in the second half are we yes but I mean the this notion of whether or not these commodity markets and whether or not they could be rigged and whether or not they're gonna drive prices or change fundamental outcomes or crash dollar all these sort of things a lot of it has been disproven by the fact that we're 10 years into it and it didn't happen we had Shanghai gold and futures markets the the silver and gold futures markets there that hasn't seemingly changed anything silver and gold are still at the same price that they were when those launched in Shanghai so whether or not this oil mark of futures will change anything to the US dollar or the petro dollar it remains to be seen everyone loves a good story though and that's what separates us from the animals as mentioned when we come back we'll be talking with David Morgan about silver don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to David Morgan he's in the Pacific Northwest David Morgan of the Morgan report dot-com David welcome back to the Kaiser report actually I have to and be back with you thank you yeah well let's get into silver now JP Morgan our friend our nemesis JP Morgan apparently they've got a whole lot of silver that's what we're hearing at least according to many headlines now how much do they have according to this headline that we've been reading and how much do they really have according to David Morgan it's impossible to determine the absolute amount what the facts show is that they have about a hundred and thirty-five million ounces of silver currently and that's basis with reporting requirements from the CMA so right now as of today GD P Morgan has five million one hundred and twenty-two thousand ounces of silver in the registry category the registered category is what they own outright at JP Morgan it can you know move in and out at their will they also have in their warehouse 133 of call 134 million ounces of silver which is the eligible category which is generally long-term investors that have trusted JP Morgan to hold their silver so you cannot sell any of the eligible category until the owner of that silver signs the form basically that says I want to sell much silver put it on the market at this price or sell it at the market or whatever so the total is a hundred and thirty nine million ounce there's a hundred and seventeen thousand five hundred and eighty two ounces of silver owned at the category of JP Morgan but again I wanted to find that most of that is at the eligible category and most of us know that the eligible category is long term investors and non hilari owned by JP Morgan now can JP Morgan have some silver nal Oh category yes it can but I think it's an inaccurate assumption to think that all of that silver it's owned by them and no one is throwing it silver in their facility uh how much of it in the eligible categories there's it's hard to say most of us think very little but it can't be proven one way one way all right so this falls under the heading are we at an inflection point in the price of silver you know we've been covering summer for many years it traded from four to fourteen for many years now it's hanging out hanging on to that 1618 range which for seems like an eternity and you've got this JP Morgan news out there apparently they're buying silver also the gold to silver ratio is 82 so which is historically very very high is all this adding up to a bullish case for silver are we about to break out of the doldrums David Morgan I believe we are if you look at the commitment of traders report which most have been oh let's say I've learned about how important the commitment of traders reports are especially for gold and silver and we are in a unique case something I haven't seen I've been looking at them for like 20 years or so which is that silver basis the co T the commitment of traders is at a level where there's basically nowhere to go but up that does not mean that it couldn't go lower still but we're basically in a net short position which hasn't happened in this category for since 2003 I believe it's been like 13 years so we are at an extremely well positioned area for silver to move higher just because the commitment of traders shows that it's at this level doesn't necessarily mean it's instantaneous but the other facts what you mentioned max are over 80 on the gold silver ratio which usually portends a closure of that which means that silver starts to outperform go the gold co t is not nearly as bullish as a sub co t normally they come inside pretty much but at this point in time that's not the case so one of the best traits I think you could use it this time would be to do a spread which means to short goal to go on silver and all that means is not to be disliked the whole just expects over to outperform gold it's rather conservative trade and it also requires less margin to perform a spreadsheet alright fair enough so now you know we've been talking to you for a number of years and the big Bugaboo with talking about gold and silver as always the fact that the US dollar is got tremendous support and all US dollar denominated assets are supported and you've got central banks around the world in on the game and they love the dollar they hate precious metals because they want to push the fiat currency and everything associated with it however now we've got in China launching an oil futures market priced in yuan many say this is the beginning of the petro UN and the end of the petro dollar so this would pull possibly a leg under out from underneath the dollar as world reserve currency is that a fair statement or what are your thoughts on this David I think it's a fair statement max the only thing I'm a more public inserted a little older doesn't make me any wise it although I hope it's good I do think it out will have an impact I'm just not willing today's gonna be immediate but I think over time it definitely will cut into the dollar hegemony in the petro dollar overtime and what does that mean David I would guess you know six months to year could be instantly or very soon we've only had one day of trading I've read several articles about it certainly the trading was robust WTI using me wantin there was a arbitrage opportunity which is interesting right from the get-go so I do think it will have something the tide of gold that's a little bit of a stretch I did an interview with Alastair McLeod from gold money and we're friends I can't see that there's a possibility to make two trades but it isn't tied to record a gold although those are trade in that parameter in this new based petrodollar petrol contract could if they elected to moving another contract gold back but it isn't tied directly right so China lost a gold features priced and you had a year ago or two years ago and has this had any impact no it hasn't yet really I mean anytime you take you know physical gold from the overall supply doesn't have enough fact and well truthfully yes I mean it moved from one hand to another hand but but really did it affect the price which affect the price substantially and the answer to that is basically no China and Russia particularly have been accumulating gold for years as the gatah guys like to say that there's been given this gift with the derivatives market getting the price at a level that they just keep buying and buying and buying so as far as a shift of physical is concern it's been massive it's been an accumulation for years and years that cannot be discounted and if you go to a gold backing in other words how much currencies out there versus how much gold is held by a nation state Russia has the best ratio so I think it's very important from that perspective or from a fundamental perspective but as far as does it you know effect the price the answers they're too smart to let it affect the price at this important time that's my view they're taking advantage as goddess says of what the derivative is market gives them as far as the price finding eken ism right you make a good point there Russia has been accumulating gold China's been accumulating gold precious metals and as far as precious metals as a percentage of their reserves and GDP they're pretty well position going forward you know we're in an environment where there's a lot of rhetoric a lot of heated rhetoric so-called cold war 2.0 and is this type of an environment tend to favor gold and silver David absolutely I mean the whole system is you know as we both know max a con game it's a confidence game and that's the problem because once confidence is lost then things to break apart rather rapid so right now the you know Brazil Russia India China and South Africa have formed years ago the Asian infrastructure investment bank they moved down the twist system so they position himself so basically isolate themselves financially from a dollar collapse now whether or not that would hold or not I would say remains to be determined but obviously the effort has been made and again to repeat they continue to buy that one thing that's been trusted for thousands years in this gold so if you look at it as objectively as I possibly can and it speaks volumes and why would these central banks in these you know in the BRICS want so much gold I mean it's pretty obvious they don't trust a dollar so I think it's a continuation and when is the breaking point I've made to be determined but I think we're ever closer especially with this depetro situation that we just talked about alright and the big competitors for the precious metal buck over the past three years of course has been crypto currency and bitcoin had a huge run-up in 2017 now big pullback of 2018 do you think there's gonna be a rotation now from those who are looking for sound money and alternative to the US dollar would rotate out of cryptos and into precious metals and particularly into silver because silver it seems to be uniquely undervalued at this stage David well totally certainly like to say when day does make a market but I meant again man at the end our cocoa complex where I spoke and I had suggested on one of the interviews that it'd be a good time perhaps to take some bitcoin profit moving into silver he did it one bit close at 17-thousand so he's pretty happy at that point in time I think the next phase could be again this is my biased where you start to see what we're already seeing which means more and more crypto currencies that are backed by gold or silver or both and you're seeing more in those I think that could be the next leg of the crypto currency or the distributed and alleged technology going forward there's been a lot in the Bitcoin world ether like when some of the better known ones that are probably the most legitimate and there's been probably I don't know arts number that have been basically what's in it for me only type of things it's a great technology I'm not against the blockchain I am a little skeptical of what the true anonymity of it is and also what it's a long-term availability meaning and I'll digress here a moment max but I was at the silver summit in San Francisco November of last year it was myself to case the agent day and a couple other presenters and we're asked ten years out if you could buy one asset Bitcoin or gold what would you buy and all of us answered gold all right well you know this attracted a lot of interesting heavyweights like Ron Paul in the Bitcoin space that was at the gym recently and one TV they had an IRA for silver and on another TV was Ron Paul advertising IRAs with Bitcoin so these two are battling it out but silver certainly is looking like it's like bitcoins circa you know be after the mount gots collapse it's uh it's it's bits time for a rally and of course you're on the front line anecdotally are you starting to see order flow and interest in silver we've got about five seconds David now very little I've checked with most the main dealers here in the last week and then a market still flat there's still sellers in the market overall so it's still flat but I growing up knowing never sell a quiet market so you'd want to be careful alright fair enough never sell a quiet market thanks David Morgan for being on the Kaiser report thank you well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser and Stacey ever want to thank our guest David Morgan and you can find him over at the Morgan report comm he's trying to find us on twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye y'all
