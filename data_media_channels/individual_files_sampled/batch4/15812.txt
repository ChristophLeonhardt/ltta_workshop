next time we are forced to collectively endure the neverending demands of a public sector Union clamoring for yet another raise or a cost-of-living increase or more benefits or a better retirement package let us all point to the stunning case of one Carles ratio is the Carles ratio story funny or tragic or a combination of the two you see until recently Carlos was a hard-working archives director employed by the Spanish government well actually he wasn't really all that hard working in fact for more than a decade Carlos didn't work at all oh sure he came to work bright and early every morning and he wouldn't check out until quitting time which was 4:00 p.m. this being a government gig but the thing is it would appear that the main job function for Carlos was to bugger off for all the hours in between starting time and quitting time that's right for 10 years this guy was never in the office he did nothing no that's not fair he undoubtedly took many coffee breaks and he probably found some nice shady spots in which to nap but aside from all those fiestas and siestas Carlos did zip and was all the while being paid by the taxpayers of Spain to do so alas the keen-eyed colleagues of Carlos finally noticed that he was seldom at his post all that took was ten years of absenteeism and any event his co-workers likely motivated by jealousy raise the alarm and this slacker supreme was finally sacked unsurprisingly Carlos was unapologetic he told the Spanish TV channel a sexta quote I do documentation work out of the office the work of a slave working like a slave means I worked so that others get the fruit of my labor and yeah just one hitch a tribunal completely rejected that explanation noting that investigations failed to turn up any record of any work he claimed of done over that decade long period but this being the public sector hope abounds for while Carlos is currently out of a job he can indeed reapply for another government gig in nine years I guess a lifetime ban for pilfering a decade's worth of tax dollars would be a tad too harsh after all for the rabble dot media I'm David the man Zoid Menzies hey folks the rebel has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
