00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,110
mess and it's because I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been dealing</font>

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,990
with more internal things lately not

my heart my mind a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big things</font>

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool but anyway when it comes to care</font>

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,100
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> on YouTube and I guess you</font>

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,590
could measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's care for someone</font>

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,190
else or something else based on clicks

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,260
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate that now you</font>

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,840
for who I am and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font>

23
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,809
do and then click on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my channel username</font>

24
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:00,120
to then see my other videos and then the

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,289
more clicks you make the more

26
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,359
interesting care you have for me as a

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,459
person up in relation to this video

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,250
there is a link in the description box

29
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,439
and if you click it it will take you to

30
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,020
a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> i filmed earlier today and I</font>

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">just didn't know if it should have gone</font>

32
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">on this channel it doesn't look that</font>

33
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,299

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,810

35
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,250
just explaining where I am in life at

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,200
the moment because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I've had</font>

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a really big decision about what</font>

38
