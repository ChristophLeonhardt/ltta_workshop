back during the election Tom Brady who is of course the quarterback for the New England Patriots seemed to be supportive of Donald Trump in fact he had a make America great again hat in his locker which he has slowly but surely tucked away and now recently he decided to talk about Donald Trump's statements in regard to NFL players who refused to stand during the national anthem he was on the Kirk and Callahan show and here's what he had to say about Trump's comments to those who refused to stand yeah I mean I certainly disagree with you know what he said and and you know thought it was just devices and you know like I said it's you know I just want to support my teammates and I'll I always say I'm never one that says oh that's wrong or that's right or that's but I do believe in what I believe in and I believe I'm bringing people together and respect and love and trust and and you know those are the values that my parents instilled to me and that's how I try to live every day and you know I've been blessed to be in a locker room with guys from all over the United States over the course of my career so my great friends are from you know Florida you know Virginia you know New York Montana Colorado Texas I mean I think one thing about football is it brings so many guys together guys that you would never have the opportunity to to be around whether it was in college and all the way into the pros and we're all different and we're all unique and you know that's what makes us all so special so he was also asked about those who agree with Trump and actually disagree with those who refused to stand for the national anthem and here's what he had to say about it and I totally agree with him I think everyone has the right to do whatever they want to do if you don't agree that is fine you can voice your disagreement I think that is great it's part of our democracy as long as it is done in a peaceful respectful way that is what our country has been all about at least that's what our country is supposed to be all about so I thought those were some interesting statements and I was more curious to read what his fans had to say about his comments because a lot of his fans are Trump supporters who are enraged about NFL players not standing the anthem and they think he's sold out I don't know who he sold out to but apparently you can't have a disagreement without selling out somehow Elizabeth Warren that's who he sold out to this senator from Massachusetts Massachusetts one of the most liberal states in the country that the Patriots are obviously from that general area and so that's the problem right the the right wing fans are giving so much more of a voice so people like all the fans don't want Kaepernick wait a minute a lot of the fans do want Kaepernick but they never get anywhere near the coverage there's a Kaepernick's jerseys were selling like crazy etc but that didn't get if you're a right winger though you have more privileged voice and so I'm sure that our overwhelming percentage of Massachusetts agrees with Tom Brady's lady's statement which by the way was not that bold it's not like he was saying oh yeah Kaepernick is right it's not like he was saying yes there is police brutality he said you could even argue that it was milquetoast I have a lot of friends from all over the country because I've played sports with them in other words right I have black friends and white friends and Latino friends right his strongest statement was I certainly disagree with what he said that was his strongest statement and and of course an argument can be made that that was milquetoast that wasn't a strong statement but coming from someone who supported Trump and had a maggot in his locker I think it's important for him to speak out because right now I feel like there is this need to support your candidate regardless of what he or she does and that's crazy it's okay to criticize someone that you supported a politician that you like you are supposed to hold them accountable and look regardless of where you stand on the national anthem debate you have to at least acknowledge that it's unacceptable for a president to refer to individuals who are practicing their First Amendment rights sons-of-bitches that is insane now look I don't mind the vulgar language it is a weird thing for the president to do it and to me the much worse part and I think what begins to try your First Amendment actual First Amendment issues is when the leader of the government says that somebody should be fired at what they said yes and so so when Brady says I definitely disagree with what he said it's not that bold a statement either because he's saying should his fellow players some of his fellow players be fired and be called sons of bitches for what they're doing it'd be a little crazy for him to go in the other direction you know Trump is right you know I think a bunch of players that FL should be fired for speaking their mind that would be an unbelievable statement so like Trump put himself in a position where he couldn't win he turned everyone against them because saying that their teammates should be fired means that all the players have to support Kaepernick whereas before not a lot of them were supporting him right and he turned to coaches against him he turned the general managers against them and then he even turned the owners against them because then he started saying people shouldn't go to the games and the owners on whoa whoa that's not cool so now they all disagree with his statements because he's too stupid a rational argument even for his own side so look and for the people who think that Brady was milquetoast there that's the issue I brought up I hear you but he also has a right to be milquetoast but yeah I'll take it I'll take it he's not it would be one thing if he was this politically outspoken hath leet and then this situation occurs and he has a very mild statement mediocre statement but he doesn't look I don't know too much about Tom Brady to be fair but he doesn't strike me as someone who engages in political discussions on a regular basis no having that hat was the most political thing he'd ever done right so in look and if you're LeBron James and Tamir rice gets shot in Cleveland and then the cops double down about it that's a moment where I was hoping that LeBron James would would do something more political and and stand up for justice now as it turns out belatedly in my opinion LeBron has done a lot more now and he's also announced supporting Steph Curry in there and the Warriors etc against Trump he's done a wonderful job recently so he's become a little bit more political but you're right Brady is has never been that guy and so for him to come out and say Trump was definitely wrong for a lot of folks that's a big deal so hey don't look a gift horse in the mouth look so god bless wonderful I'm glad to see him sharing his opinion an opinion that is hard to disagree with right and lastly I like that little reference that Anna made it's very sly how he tucked away the hat like the Tuck rule right Anna yeah totally see I know stuff I don't I don't know what the Tucker rule is it was a total accident don't even tell me yeah long story does it have to do with the jockstrap is not the tougher you know just I just ask any Raiders fan with the Tuck rule is if you like this clip of The Young Turks you know there's a whole live two-hour show 6 to 8 p.m. Eastern every day and you could download it or stream in and watch it without ads if
