PRIMARIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AFTER A LECTURE BREAKING NEWS WE WILL BRING YOU RESULTS AS WE GET THEM INTIMATE. BUT FIRST WE WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK 48 HOURS. NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN WAS THE BIG DEAL THEN IN WIDELY RESPECTED GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. A FEMINIST ICON WHO WAS REGARDED BY MANY AS A POTENTIAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE. THERE'S NOT A PROGRESSIVE CROSS THAT ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN DIDN'T EMBRACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND THEN IN TIME TO IMPOSE BY FOREST ON THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK STATE. SCHNEIDERMAN WAS AN ALL-PURPOSE LEFT-WING ACTIVIST. HE WAS ESPECIALLY AN AGGRESSIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE #MeToo MOVEMENT, WATCH. THE CHALLENGES FACING THESE SURVIVORS ARE PART OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF DISCRIMINATION AND REALLY A MANIFESTATION OF A CULTURE OF MALE SUPREMACY.
