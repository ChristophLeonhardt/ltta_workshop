ABBOTT LABORATORIES.

65
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:58,685
INTERESTING THEY ARE DOWN,

66
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,353
BECAUSE THEY WERE UP EARLIER.

67
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:03,590
AND CARSON BLOCK SAID THAT THEY

68
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,526
ANNOUNCED SHORTING SAINT JUDE

69
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,627
AND THEY ARE LONG ABBOTT

70
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:09,429
LABORATORIES, BECAUSE THEY WANT

71
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,464
TO BREAK UP THE PURCHASE AND

72
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,699
THAT ABBOTT LABORATORIES

73
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,936

THE WEEK.

78
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:24,177

CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY'S ARE

84
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:37,990

96
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,081

OF FULL CONFIDENCE IN THE

98
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,984
FINANCE MINISTER, BUT THAT DOES

99
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:06,386
NOT DO MUCH FOR THE RAND.

100
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,554
WE SAW THE DOLLAR DROPPED VERSUS

101
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:11,991
THE RAND, BUT THEN WE SAW THE

102
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,525
RAND WEEKEND.

103
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,795
IT IS THE WORST PERFORMING

104
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:16,462
CURRENCY THIS MONTH.

105
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,731
THE SECOND WORST IS THE CHILEAN

106
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,098
PESO.

107
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:21,401
A GAIN THE MOST IN TWO WEEKS.

108
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,936
IF PROMPTED DOLLARS TO BE

109
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:26,172
TRADED.

110
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:27,039
AND THURSDAY IS TYPICALLY A GOOD

111
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,674
DAY FOR THE CHILEAN PESO,

112
00:03:28,674 --> 00:03:30,543
BECAUSE THE MINING COMPANIES

113
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,779
SELL DOLLARS TO RAISE THE MONEY

114
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,916
AND FOR PAYROLL COMMITMENTS.

115
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,620
SEBASTIAN FOUND THAT TYPICALLY

116
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,421
THE PESO DOES WELL, GAINING ON

117
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,022
THURSDAYS AND FALLING THE OTHER

118
00:03:43,022 --> 00:03:43,589
DAYS OF THE WEEK.

119

120
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:46,526

121
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:52,865
WE SAW GAINS TODAY AND HOPE, ALL

122
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:53,599
THESE ABOUT PRODUCTION, BUT

123
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,468

125
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:02,241
SOA SOLVE -- SO WE SAW A GAIN.

126
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:02,909

127

132
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,919

133
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,887
TO CROSS BELOW THE 100.

134
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:19,892
IT COULD BE A NEGATIVE EVENT.

135
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:20,994
IT COULD BE NEGATIVE MOMENTUM.

136
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,063

137
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,199
JOE: WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON

138
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:26,599
THAT.

139
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,135

ANOTHER DAY OF LOOKING AT IT.

146
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,349

147
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,485

149

BASIS POINTS, THE TIGHTEST MOVE

150
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:50,756

154
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,398

155
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:00,166
THE YELLOW CIRCLES INDICATE WHEN

156
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,101

166

VERSION.

168
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:28,795

169
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:30,430
YOU CAN SEE THE TREND, WHICH

170
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,432
CONTINUES TO BE LOWER.

171
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,233
WE ARE AT A FOUR DECADE LOW AND

172
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,501
WE GO LOWER.

173
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,470
THIS IS THE MOVING AVERAGE.

174
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,440
IT IS AT THE LOWEST IT HAS BEEN

175
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,008
SINCE THE CRISIS.

176
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,042

FOUR-WEEK MOVING AVERAGE NOW.

179
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:48,648
JOE: FORGET ABOUT THE WEEKLY

180
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:49,015
NOISE.

181
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,117
MATT: THE LABOR MARKET IS

182
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,719
STRONG.

183
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,588
I AM LOOKING AT INFLATION.

184
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,390
PRICE STABILITY IS THE SECOND

185
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,659
THING THAT THE FED WILL LOOK AT.

186
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,162
AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS 3034 ON

187
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:05,565
THE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL.

188
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:09,268
THE CLEVELAND FED CPI IN BLUE,

189
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,503
AND WE ALSO HAVE THE PURPLE

190
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,604
LINE.

191
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:17,677
THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE AXES, SAY

192
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,477
CANNOT REALLY SEE THE STRENGTH

193
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:19,045
OF THE WHITE LINE.

194
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,316
THE ATLANTA LINE IS SHOWING 3.6%

195
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,152
GDP GROWTH ON THIS QUARTER, SO

196
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:31,023
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE DECENT

197
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:32,925
GROWTH AT LEAST FROM THE ATLANTA

198
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:33,459
GDP FORECAST.

199
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:35,828
WE HAVE INFLATION THAT IS GOING

200
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,496
UP TOWARD A LEVEL THAT THE FED

201
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:38,130
SHOULD BE HAPPY WITH.

202
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:41,500
IT IS 1.6%.

203
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,501
AND WE HAVE A LABOR PICTURE AS

204
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:46,772
JOE SHOWED THAT IS FANTASTIC.

205
00:06:46,772 --> 00:06:47,607
IF THE FED IS DATA DEPENDENT AND

206
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:51,877
IT LOOKS AT THE DATA WITH THE

207
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:52,645
TWO MANDATES, MAYBE IT SHOULD BE

208
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,479
NORMALIZING THE INTEREST RATES.

209
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:56,549
SCARLET: THAT IS WHAT A LOT OF

210
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:57,049
PEOPLE SAY.

211
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,785
LET'S GET TO BREAKING NEWS WE

212
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:00,953
HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING ALL DAY.

213
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,922
AND MATT REFERENCED IT EARLIER.

214
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,191
MUDDY WATERS TAKING ON ST. JUDE

215
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,394
MEDICAL.

216
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,195
THEY PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT

217
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,963
SAYS THAT THE PACEMAKERS ARE

218
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:11,664
EXPOSED TO HACKING BRONER

219
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,098
ABILITIES.

220
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,166
CARSON BLOCK SAYS THAT CHANGES

221
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:14,967
MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

222
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:19,105
>> THIS APPEARS TO BE A COMPANY

223
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,706
THAT FOR YEARS HAS PUT PROFITS

224
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,876
BEFORE PATIENTS WHEN IT COMES TO

225
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,111
SEPARATE SECURITY.

226
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:29,248
AND WE THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

227
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:29,949
MAKE SURE THAT USERS ARE

228
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,150
NOTIFIED OF THE RISKS.

229
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,818
AND TO HOLD A PUBLIC THING

230
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:33,285
ACCOUNTABLE.

231
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,055
-- PUBLICLY ACCOUNTABLE.

232
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,126
SCARLET: THEY DISCOVER THE FLAWS

233
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,893
THANKS TO A SEPARATE SECURITY

234
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,394
FIRM.

235
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,095
HERE TO DISCUSS THE STORY IS A

236
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:46,199
FORMER -- ASSOCIATE.

237
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,769
BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD

238
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:50,569
FROM THE IS YOUR REACTION TO

239
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,337
THESE ALLEGATIONS FROM CARSON

240
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:52,405
BLOCK?

241
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,441
>> I READ THE NOVEL.

242
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,311
IT WAS A FLASH IN THE PAN.

243
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,480
AND THERE REALLY IS AN ISSUE

244
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,314
HERE, RATHER THAN PICKING UP THE

245
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,450
PHONE AND SHORTING THE STOCK,

246
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,117
YOU SHOULD CALL THE FDA.

247
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,820
SCARLET: IF THE RESEARCH FIRM

248
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,590
THAT FOUND THE LOOPHOLES

249
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,424
APPROACH THE FDA WITH FINDINGS,

250
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,425
WHAT WOULD THE RESPONSE HAVE

251
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:12,825
BEEN?

252
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:17,129
>> THEY WOULD HAVE EXPLAINED HOW

253
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,465
THEY FOUND THE PHONE OR BUDDIES,

254
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,967
WEATHER DATA WOULD TELL AND --

255
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:25,304
WHAT THE DATA WOULD TELL AND

256
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,138
THEN THE FDA WOULD'VE TAKEN

257
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:26,572
ACTION.

258
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,442
BUT NOW IT IS A MARKET STORY.

259
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,878
CLEARLY THERE IS SUSPICION THAT

260
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:33,578
THE PUBLIC HEALTH IS NOT

261
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:34,246
PRIMARY, IT IS SECONDARY.

262
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:37,549
JOE: WHEN IT COMES TO GADGETS

263
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:40,720
AND HACK ABILITY OF GADGETS,

264
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,522
OBVIOUSLY MORE AND MORE OF OUR

265
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,191
LIVES ARE GOING TO BE IMPLANTED

266
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,158
DEVICES THAT ARE CONNECTED TO

267
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:49,361
THE INTERNET.

268
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,162
HOW ON THE BALL IS IN THE FDA

269
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:50,596
WITH THAT?

270
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,966
>> I WOULD NOT SAY THEY ARE ON

271
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:54,767
THE CUTTING EDGE OF TECHNOLOGY,

272
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,735
BUT THEY KNOW HOW TO RELATE

273
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:56,636
MEDICAL -- REGULATE MEDICAL

274
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,537
DEVICES.

275
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,539
HOW THEY BECOME MORE

276
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,307
INTERACTIVE, HOW THEY OPERATE

277
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:03,743
WITH SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OF THE

278
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,410
BODY, THEY NEED TO LEARN

279
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,845
QUICKLY.

280
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,712
THEY NEED TO GET CONSULTANTS AND

281
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,481
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

282
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,416
POTENTIAL NEGATIVE DOWNSIDES

283
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:10,850
COULD BE.

284
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,653
SCARLET: DISCUSS THE EVOLUTION

285
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,621
OF HACKING FITS INTO THE FDA

286
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,590
PRIORITIES WITH NEW PRODUCTS?

287
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,592
HOW HAS IT CHANGED?

288
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:23,696
>> DEVICES HAVE BECOME MORE

289
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,932
COMPLEX, EVEN IN THE MOST RECENT

290
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:27,399
FIVE YEARS.

291
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,067
THEY NEED TO REACH OUT TO

292
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,002
EXPERTS WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT

293
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:30,836
THESE DEVICES, THEY NEED TO KNOW

294
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,639
WHAT THE DEVICE DOES IN EVERY

295
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,106
RESPECT.

296
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,275
NOT ONLY HOW IT INTERACTS WITH

297
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:38,477
THE PARTS FOR A DRUG, BUT ALSO

298
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:40,880
HOW IT INTERACTS WITH OUTSIDE

299
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,380
TECHNOLOGY.

300
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,349
SCARLET: WOULD YOU WORK WITH A

301
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,685
FIRM LIKE MEDSEC?

302
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,554
>> YES.

303
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:49,321
YOU NEED TO WORK WITH OUTSIDE

304
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:49,722
FIRMS.

305
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,792
MATT: CALLING IT A SEPARATE

306
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:57,296
SECURITY FIRM I FIND INTERESTING

307
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,165
-- CYBER SECURITY FIRM I FIND

308
00:09:59,165 --> 00:09:59,965
INTERESTING, BECAUSE THIS WAS

309
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:02,568
STARTED BY A FORMER HEDGE FUND

310
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,103
EMPLOYEE, THEY ARE LOOKING FOR

311
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,904
WEAKNESSES SO THEY CAN PROFIT

312
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,840
OFF OF WEAKNESSES, LIKE THE

313
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,041
STRATEGY WITH MUDDY WATERS.

314
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:09,809
DO YOU THINK WE COULD SEE

315
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:13,746
RELATIONS BORN -- REGULATIONS

316
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,714
BORN OUT OF THIS INVESTMENT OR

317
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:16,448
BUSINESS MODEL?

318
00:10:16,448 --> 00:10:19,552
>> THERE NEEDS TO BE

319
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:20,052
REGULATIONS.

320
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,988
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THERE ARE

321
00:10:22,988 --> 00:10:23,722
NO PEOPLE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

322
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:25,992
HACKED FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES.

323
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:30,029
THIS IS ALL ABOUT MAKING STOCK

324
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,331
MOVE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

325
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,199
AND THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO MOVE

326
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:33,899
THE FORWARD PROPERLY.

327
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,701
MATT: I WANT TO READ THE

328
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,837
STATEMENT FROM SAINT JUDE.

329
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,606
IT IS IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU WHAT

330
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,741
CHANGES IS SAYING.

331
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,944
THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER

332
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:48,113
SAYING, THE ALLEGATIONS ARE

333
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:48,514
UNTRUE.

334
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:49,248
THERE ARE SEVERAL LAYERS OF

335
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:49,782
SECURITY IN PLACE.

336
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,985
WE CONDUCT SECURITY ON AN

337
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,752
ONGOING BASIS AND WORK WITH

338
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:56,155
EXPERTS SPECIFICALLY AT HOME AND

339
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,123
ON ALL DEVICES.

340
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:02,194
SAINT JUDE TAKES THE SECURITY OF

341
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,430
DEVICES VERY SERIOUSLY AND

342
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,231
CONSUMER INFORMATION IS A HIGH

343
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,532
PRIORITY FOR US.

344
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:07,366
AND WE WILL REMAIN VIGILANT TO

345
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,101
THE EVER INCREASING

346
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,070
SOPHISTICATION OF THOSE SEEKING

347
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,040
UNLAWFUL ACCESS OF DATA.

348
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:15,808
THERE IS AN ONGOING PROGRAM TO

349
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,610
PERFORM TESTING ON MEDICAL

350
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,410
DEVICES AND NETWORK EQUIPMENT.

351
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,779
SCARLET: AND THE OTHER BIG STORY

352
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:23,883
WE WANT TO ASK ABOUT IS ON

353
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:24,283
MYLAN.

354
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,219
MATT: IT IS A FASCINATING STORY,

355
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:30,356
IT IS PRICE GOUGING.

356
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,057
MYLAN IS UNDER THE MICROSCOPE.

357
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:34,360
WHAT IS FASCINATING IS THEY HAVE

358
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,263
RAISED PRICES TO $600 AND PEOPLE

359
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:39,398
ARE APPALLED BY THAT.

360
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:43,469
THEY ONLY GET $270 FROM THAT.

361
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:48,507
THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE

362
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,944
BENEFITS COMPANY ARE GETTING

363
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,146
$334, SO YOU CAN SEE, THE

364
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:58,517
PATIENT'S PAIN THE FULL 600 --

365
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,654
PAYING THE FULL $608 MESKO IT

366
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:02,388
LOOKS LIKE MANY PEOPLE ARE

367
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:02,922
SHARING THE GAINS.

368
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,557
>> I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY OR

369
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,026
THE POSITIVE THING IS THE FDA

370
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,595
CAN INSERT COMPETITION INTO THE

371
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:11,530
MICROPLATES -- MARKETPLACE.

372
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,936
THESE ARE DRUGS THAT ARE OFF

373
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:17,703
PATENT, THERE IS NO GENERIC.

374
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,705
THERE'S BEEN NO GENERIC COMPANY.

375
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,507
SO WHEN YOU BRING THOSE INTO THE

376
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:24,343
MARKET PLACE, THE PRICES

377
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:24,777
PLUMMET.

378
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:28,480

OBVIOUSLY AT THE PENS -- EPIPENS

THEY ARE DOWN ALMOST 11% IN THE

SECOND QUARTER.

389
00:12:51,236 --> 00:12:53,639
THAT IS DOUBLE WHAT THE EXPERTS

390
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,139
ESTIMATED.

391
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:56,675

THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE

MINNEAPOLIS FED SAYS WE NEED TO

398
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:21,553
HEAR A CREDIBLE PLAN FOR

399
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:22,187
MANAGING THE ECONOMY.

JANET YELLEN TOMORROW?

404
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:35,667
NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA: THANK YOU

405
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,503
FOR HAVING ME.

406
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:41,140
I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO

407
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,243
HEAR HER THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY

408
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,444
PLAN TO APPROACH THE PROBLEM OF

409
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,147
INTEREST RATES OVER THE NEXT SIX

410
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:49,481
MONTHS-TWO YEARS.

411
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,852
I THINK WHAT THE FED

412
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,687
COMMUNICATED WAS THAT THEY ARE

413
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:57,122
PLANNING TO RAISE INTEREST RATES

414
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:01,293
AT ABOUT A QUARTER PERCENTAGE

415
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,329
POINT PER QUARTER FOR THE NEXT

416
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:04,763
FEW YEARS.

417
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:08,233
I DO NOT THINK THAT WAS A PLAN

418
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,302
THAT HAS WORKED OVER THE PAST

419
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:10,669
YEAR.

420
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,940
I THINK IT IS IN TATTERS.

421
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,741
IT BETTER WAY TO COMMUNICATE

422
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,944
ABOUT MONETARY POLICY IS TO

423
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,813
ISOLATE THE DRIVERS THAT ARE

424
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,315
DRIVING YOUR THINKING AND THEN

425
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,684
LOOKING AT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

426
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,753
PUBLIC TO WATCH THE DRIVERS AND

427
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:30,522
SEE HOW THE FED WILL MAKE

428
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:30,923
CHOICES.

429
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,324
I DO NOT THINK IT IS A GREAT

430
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,494
IDEA AND I HOPE THAT JANET

431
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,729
YELLEN WALKS AWAY FROM THESE

432
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,665
TIME-BASED FORECASTS THAT WE

433
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:45,537
HEAR OVER AGAIN, ABOUT HOW WE

434
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,538
WILL HEAR ABOUT THESE IN 2016,

435
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,307
2017.

436
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:49,174
THESE ARE NOT GOOD WAYS TO LOOK

437
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,043
AT MONETARY POLICY.

438
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,745
WHEN THEY GET INTO A MEETING

439
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,847
ROOM, THEY SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT

440
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:57,683
THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH,

441
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,485
LOOKING AT DATA FLOW, TO HELP

442
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:01,386
DETERMINE WHETHER TO RAISE

443
00:17:01,386 --> 00:17:01,753
RATES.

444
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:05,824
JOE: WE ARE IN THIS TIME IN

445
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,859
MILITARY -- IN MONETARY POLICY,

446
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,596
WHERE THERE IS A DEBATE ABOUT

447
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,798
WHAT REALLY DRIVES INFLATION AND

448
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,000
WHETHER THE FRAMEWORK THROUGH

449
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,701
WHICH WE THINK ABOUT THESE

450
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,036
QUESTIONS IS ACTUALLY AN

451
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:17,903
ACCURATE ONE.

452
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:23,141
IN YOUR TENURE AT THE FED, YOU

453
00:17:23,141 --> 00:17:24,042
ARE FAMOUS BECAUSE YOU

454
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:25,978
REORIENTED YOUR APPROACH, YOU

455
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,715
ARE SEEN AS HAWKISH, NOW DOVISH.

456
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,218
THAT IS RARE IN PROFESSIONAL

457
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,019
CIRCLES FOR ANYBODY TO DO A TURN

458
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:34,453
LIKE THAT.

459
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,955
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT

460
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:37,923
HAPPENED AND WHY THAT IS NOT

461
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:44,162
MORE COMMON IN ACADEMIA, IN

462
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:44,863
ECONOMICS, OR THE FEDERAL

463
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:47,299
RESERVE?

464
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:51,003
NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA: WHEN I

465
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:53,272
FIRST JOINED THE FED IN

466
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:56,074
MINNEAPOLIS, I FELT THAT THERE

467
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,043
WERE STRONG FORCES THAT WOULD

468
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,145
RETURN INFLATION TO TARGET

469
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:02,781
RAPIDLY, REGARDLESS OF

470
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,984
UNEMPLOYMENT, OR SLACK AS WE SAY

471
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,152
IN THE LABOR MARKET.

472
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:10,956
AS I SPEND MORE TIME WATCHING

473
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:16,561
THE DATA FLOW, THAT ASSESSMENT

474
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:17,329
TURNED OUT TO BE MORE AND MORE

475
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:17,696
WRONG.

476
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,166
AND I ALSO WAS CONCERNED THAT

477
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,336
THERE MAY NOT BE MUCH SLACK AND

478
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,972
THAT PROVED TO BE WRONG.

479
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:29,541
WHERE DID IT PROVE WRONG?

480
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,309
THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK ON

481
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:35,247
ESTIMATING SLACK COMMITTEES --

482
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,916
SLACK, THIS IS MICRO WORK.

483
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,353
I WAS MISSING HIGH ON INFLATION,

484
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:42,154
SO YOU NEED TO REEVALUATE WHERE

485
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,355
YOU ARE ON THAT.

486
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:47,392
WHY OTHERS DO NOT MAKE THE TURN?

487
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:51,063
EVERYBODY MUST COME INTO THESE

488
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,198
DECISION-MAKING PROBLEMS WITH

489
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:53,865
THEIR OWN PERSPECTIVE.

490
00:18:53,865 --> 00:18:58,337
I APPROACH THESE QUESTIONS AS

491
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:02,341
WHAT WE CALL A BAYESIAN, YOU

492
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,108
HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT MODELS

493
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,676
AND POSSIBILITIES OUT THERE IN

494
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,510
TERMS OF HOW THE WORLD WORKS AND

495
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:07,512
YOU ARE ALWAYS PUTTING WEIGHT ON

496
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:09,314
ALL OF THEM AND AS DATA COMES

497
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,551
IN, IT COULD CHANGE THE WAY TO

498
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:13,318
YOU ARE PUTTING ON ONE VERSUS

499
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,853
THE OTHER.

500
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:15,721
WHEN I HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT

501
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:19,324
THE ECONOMY, THEY ARE WEDDED TO

502
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,025
ONE FRAMEWORK AND THEY WILL

503
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,526
STICK TO IT UNLESS SOMETHING

504
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:23,562
BLOWS UP.

505
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,231
MY OWN THINKING IS MORE FLUID I

506
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:26,698
WOULD SAY.

507
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:29,701
SCARLET: WE APPRECIATE YOU

508
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,537
EXPLAINING THE FLUIDITY.

509
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,974
HOW DO YOU THINK THE FED'S

510
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,576
DEFINITION OF DATA DEPENDENT HAS

511
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,544
EVOLVED?

512
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:42,280
NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA: GREAT

513
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:42,714
QUESTION.

514
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:46,251
I THINK THAT DATA DEPENDENCE

515
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,388
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO CONVEY THAT

516
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:51,557
EVERY MEETING WAS LIFE.

517
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,793
-- LIVE.

518
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,895
THEY WANTED TO GET BACK TO A

519
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,662
WORLD WHERE THEY WERE NOT

520
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:59,731
TELLING MARKETS WAY AHEAD OF

521
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,700
TIME WHERE THE INTEREST RATES

522
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,501
WOULD BECOME A SAID THEY WOULD

523
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,804
NOT SAY A YEAR AHEAD WHERE THEY

524
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:06,271
WOULD BE.

525
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,072
INSTEAD, THEY ARE TRYING TO TELL

526
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:07,739
THE MARKETS TO WATCH DATA.

527
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:10,475
I THINK THE PROBLEM HAS BECOME

528
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:14,613
THE FED IS NOT SAYING WHAT DATA

529
00:20:14,613 --> 00:20:17,716
THEY ARE WATCHING IN TERMS OF

530
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,316
MAKING A DECISION.

531
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:20,852
THERE IS A LONG LIST OF

532
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:22,721
INDICATORS IN THE STATEMENT, A

533
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,723
CATCH ALL OF ALMOST EVERYTHING

534
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,758
YOU COULD THINK ABOUT AS BEING

535
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,126
RELEVANT.

536
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:28,927
AND I THINK THE FED WOULD BE

537
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,630
BETTER SERVED BY ISOLATING 2-3

538
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,598
KEY DRIVERS.

539
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:36,868
I AM THINKING ABOUT INFLATION,

540
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:37,602
PRESSURE, THE LABOR MARKET

541
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:41,773
SITUATION, AND DOWNSIDE RISKS.

542
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:42,941
THOSE ARE PLAYING MORE OF A ROLE

543
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,810
RIGHT NOW THAN THEY

544
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,979
TRADITIONALLY DO, BECAUSE OF HOW

545
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,681
SCARCE THE TOOLKIT IS.

546
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,952
THE DOWNWARD SHOCK HITS THE

547
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:54,386
ECONOMY.

548
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:55,153
AND THERE IS NOT A LOT OF ROOM

549
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:58,257
TO MANEUVER TO OFFSET THE SHOCK.

550
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,725
YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE ECONOMY AS

551
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:03,262
HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE TO WARD OFF

552
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,096
SHOCK.

553
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,332
MATT: I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK

554
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:08,133
ABOUT THE TARGETS.

555
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:11,203
I REMEMBER WHEN INFLATION

556
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,306
TARGETS, GIVING IN AN INFLATION

557
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,907
TARGET WOULD HAVE BEEN

558
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:17,175
UNTHINKABLE, NOW MOST CENTRAL

559
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,243
BANKS ARE.

560
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,547
WE WERE TALKING TO LINCOLN

561
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,448
HARRIS TODAY AND HE SAID FED

562
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,318
OFFICIALS OR CENTRAL BANKS NEED

563
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:27,853
TO RAISE IN THE INFLATION

564
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:28,687
TARGETS, BUT THEY DO NOT WANT TO

565
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,454
DO THAT.

566
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:32,357
ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE

567
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,293
TO SAY OK, WE CAN OVERSHOOT THE

568
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,094
INFLATION TARGET AND NOT WORRY

569
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:37,529
THE MARKET THAT THEY WILL PUMP

570
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,532
THE BRAKES RIGHT AWAY.

571
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,134
NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA: THESE ARE

572
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:45,637
GOOD CONSIDERATIONS TO PUT ON

573
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,505
THE TABLE.

574
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:50,575
SO, IF YOU GO BACK TO THE

575
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,577
HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT TO 2% AS A

576
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,479
TARGET.

577
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:58,550
JANET YELLEN WAS ON THE

578
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,619
GOVERNOR'S BACK IN THE 1990'S

579
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,053
AND WAS MAKING THE CASE FOR 2%.

580
00:22:02,053 --> 00:22:05,524
I THINK WE LEARNED SINCE AND

581
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:10,262
THEN -- SINCE AND THEN, -- WHICH

582
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,597
IS WHY YOU WANT A TARGET ABOVE

583
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,133
0% IN THE FIRST PLACE, IT IS

584
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,602
MORE OF A PROBLEM THAN WE MIGHT

585
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:20,572
HAVE AND DISSIPATED SAYING THEN

586
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,340
IN 1995.

587
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,408
SO THAT IS A REASON THREE THINK

588
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:23,875
THE TARGET.

589
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:27,646
-- RE-THINK THE TARGET.

590
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,714
THE FED SHOULD REALLY THINK

591
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:33,919
ABOUT THE TARGET OR WHATEVER THE

592
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:34,653
GOALS ARE FROM MONETARY POLICY

593
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,821
AS A COLLECTIVE DECISION, NOT

594
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:37,556
JUST FOR THE COMMITTEE, BUT

595
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,658
REALLY FOR CONGRESS TO WEIGH IN

596
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,459
ON AS WELL.

597
00:22:41,459 --> 00:22:45,764
AND THEN YOU GET MORE BUYING ON

598
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:46,498
THE GOALS AND GET HELP FROM

599

644
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:44,035
THINK.

645
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,605
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES, I KNOW

646
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,407
THIS FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE, IS

647
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,576

648
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:53,611

655
00:27:06,024 --> 00:27:08,459

656
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,996

JOINS US FROM ROCHESTER, NEW

755
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,680
YORK.

756
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,480
IT IS NOW TIME TO THINK ABOUT

757
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,248
THE BIG QUESTIONS.

758
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:34,252
PROFESSOR, I ALWAYS LIKE TO

759
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,253
ASK WITH A NEUTRAL REAL RATE IS

760
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:40,658
TO PLUG INTO MY MODEL.

761
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:41,359
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THE

762
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,160
EQUILIBRIUM RATE IS COMING DOWN,

763
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,994
LOWER THAN WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT.

764
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:45,196
DO YOU AGREE, AND WHERE DO YOU

765
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:47,198
THINK IT IS?

766
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,600
>> YEAH.

767
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,635
I WANT TO ANSWER THE SECOND

768
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,502
QUESTION ABOUT WHERE I THINK IT

769
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:52,337
IS.

770
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:56,007
I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE RULE

771
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,843
IN GENERAL, AND I THINK IT'S NOT

772
00:32:58,843 --> 00:32:59,677
THE BEST WAY TO FREE MONETARY

773
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:00,411
POLICY.

774
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,413
BUT I WILL A YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

775
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:03,214
THE NEUTRAL RATE AND THE FORCES

776
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:04,148
ON IT

777
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:04,448
.

778
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:09,487
YOU SEE A SLIGHT DOWNWARD TREND

779
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,090
IN THE NEUTRAL RATE, FROM THE

780
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,392
1980'S INTO THE GREAT RECESSION

781
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:20,598
IN 2007, BUT SINCE 2007, YOU

782
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,566
HAVE SEEN A VERY SHARP DECLINE.

783
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,402
THE RIGHT WAY TO GAUGE IT, I

784
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:25,536
LIKE TO USE MARKET EVIDENCE.

785
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,639
WHERE MARKETS SINK RATE INTEREST

786
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,576
RATES WILL BE, 20 OR 30 YEARS

787
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:35,880
OUT AS MUCH LOWER THAN WHAT THEY

788
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,983
THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE IN

789
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:39,750
2007, BUT 150 BASIS POINTS

790
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,120
LOWER.

791
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,954
THAT CREATES A LOT OF CHANCES

792
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,956
FOR MONETARY POLICY.

793
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:45,790
IF YOU KEEP THE SAME INFLATION

794
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,394
TARGET, YOUR LONG RUN, NOVEL

795
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:54,732
INTEREST RATES, THE FED FUNDS

796
00:33:54,732 --> 00:34:01,472
RATE, IS MORE LIKELY TO BE LOW,

797
00:34:01,472 --> 00:34:02,273
AND YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO RUN

798
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,007
INTO ZERO LOWER BOUND WHEN

799
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:03,441
SHOCKS HIT.

800
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,642
THAT FALL IN THE NEUTRAL REAL

801
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,745
RATE, I'D SAY THAT YOU SEE IN

802
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,681
MARKET DATA EVIDENCE IS ABOUT IT

803
00:34:11,681 --> 00:34:14,685
HAS FALLEN 150 BASIS POINTS, AND

804
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:15,485
THAT WILL CREATE CHALLENGES TO

805
00:34:15,485 --> 00:34:16,286
MONETARY POLICY MAKERS IF THE

806
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:16,887
GOALS REMAIN THE SAME.

807
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:20,024
JOE: PROFESSOR, IF YOU DON'T

808
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:22,560
LIKE THE TAILER RULE, DO

809
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,496
YOU HAVE ANOTHER?

810
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,166
>> [LAUGHTER]

811
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:28,966
NO, I THINK THE BETTER WAY TO

812
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:33,004
FRAME IT IS OUTLOOK DEPENDENT.

813
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,438
YOU HAVE YOUR OUTLOOK FOR YOUR

814
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:39,844
MANDATE VARIABLES, INFLATION AND

815
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:41,212
EMPLOYMENT.

816
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,847
EMPLOYMENT IS HARDER TO MEASURE,

817
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:47,652
SO THERE ARE A FEW MORE

818
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,418
CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF EXACTLY

819
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:50,487
HOW YOU MEASURE WHERE WE ARE IN

820
00:34:50,487 --> 00:34:51,922
TERMS OF HOW WE ARE DOING.

821
00:34:51,922 --> 00:34:57,094
BUT THEN, YOU ARE TRYING TO GET

822
00:34:57,094 --> 00:35:00,498
INTEREST RATES SET SO YOU CAN

823
00:35:00,498 --> 00:35:02,166
GET BACK TO THE INFLATION GOAL

824
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,869
OF 2% AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE AND

825
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:05,670
GET BACK TO MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT

826
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,337
AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.

827
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:09,173
BY THAT, I MEAN WITHIN THE EURO

828
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,108
TO.

829
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,043
-- A YEAR OR TWO.

830
00:35:12,043 --> 00:35:15,212
JOE: YOU TALK ABOUT USING MARKET

831
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:19,317
MEASURES TO DERIVE SOME SORT OF

832
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,418
ANTICIPATION OF INFLATION.

833
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:21,252
CRITICS WOULD SAY THAT THE FED

834
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:25,556
ITSELF IS INFLUENCING THE MARKET

835
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:26,457
MEASURES WITH THE FACT THAT IT'S

836
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,093
2016 AND THE FED HAS BEEN SO

837
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,929
SLOW TO RAISE RATES, IS ITSELF

838
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:36,133
SIGNAL AND THERE'S A FEEDBACK

839
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,936
LOOP.

840
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:39,737
THEY ARE ULTIMATELY LOOKING AT

841
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:40,504
SOMETHING INFLUENCED BY THE

842
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:46,244
FED ITSELF.

843
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:47,078
ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT THEY ARE

844
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:47,878
INDEPENDENT ENOUGH THAT THE FED

845
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:48,546
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THEM?

846
00:35:48,546 --> 00:35:50,815
>> YEAH, I REMAIN VERY CONFIDENT

847
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,618
IN THAT.

848
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,586
THE FEEDBACK LOOP YOU ARE

849
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:56,220
POINTING TO IS ONE OF

850
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,790
THEORETICAL INTEREST, AND IT IS

851
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:00,591
CERTAINLY ONE THAT GETS A LOT OF

852
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:01,325
EXCITEMENT AND ATTENTION IN

853
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:01,859
ACADEMIC CIRCLES.

854
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,628
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

855
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:06,530
POLICYMAKERS IN THE U.S. HAVE TO

856
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,532
BE CONCERNED ABOUT.

857
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,168
BUT THE SLIDE WE HAVE SEEN IN

858
00:36:11,168 --> 00:36:14,872
LONGER-TERM MARKET BASE

859
00:36:14,872 --> 00:36:16,908
MEASURES OVER THE PAST THREE

860
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:20,010
YEARS, ITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

861
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:20,711
FACT THAT THE FED HAS BEEN

862
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:21,445
TIGHTENING MONETARY POLICY.

863
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,681
WHILE INFLATION REMAINS LOW.

864
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:28,052
IT SEEMS TO BE TAKING STEPS TO

865
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:28,853
SLOW THE RETURN INFLATION WILL

866
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:33,891
TARGET, AND I THINK THAT HAS

867
00:36:33,891 --> 00:36:34,725
CREATED REASONABLE DOUBTS ABOUT

868
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:35,526
THE COMMITMENT TO THE 2% FLEXION

869
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:35,893
TARGET.

870
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,597
SCARLET: BLOOMBERG COLUMNIST,

871
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:40,398
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STAYING

872
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,200
WITH US.

873
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,067
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE COVERAGE

874
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,135
FROM JACKSON HOLE TOMORROW.

875
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:45,002
WE WILL BREAK DOWN THE SPEECH IN

876
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:49,106
THE MORNING, AND WE HAVE SOME OF

877
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:49,907
THE BIGGEST VOICES ON BLOOMBERG

878
00:36:49,907 --> 00:36:53,911
TOMORROW AS WELL.

879
00:36:53,911 --> 00:37:03,320
MATT: WHAT DID YOU MISS?

880
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,121
TURKEY HAS COME OUT MORE STABLE

881
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,823
FOR THE ATTEMPTED COUP.

882
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:06,557
WHAT'S NEXT FOR THEIR

883
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,324
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED

884
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:07,858
STATES AND RUSSIA.

885
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,794
JOE BIDEN WAS IN ON CURRENT

886
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:14,131
YESTERDAY -- WAS IN ANKARA

887
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,635
YESTERDAY. >> THE UNITED STATES

888
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,436
GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO DO

889
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,136
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP.

890
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:21,672
YOUR GOVERNMENT, MR. PRIME

891
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,007
MINISTER, TO BRING THOSE TO

892
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:35,553
JUSTICE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE

893
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,220
FOR THE COUP ATTEMPT.

894
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,921
MATT: LET'S BRING IN THE

895
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:37,688
GEOPOLITICAL FUTURES FOUNDER AND

896
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,355
CHAIRMAN, GEORGE FRIEDMAN.

897
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:38,989
IF YOU ARE A CONSPIRACY

898
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:39,623
THEORIST, THIS IS REALLY

899
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:40,357
ENTERTAINING TO WATCH, BECAUSE

900
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:43,561
IT WOULD APPEAR TO YOU THAT THIS

901
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,428
COUP WAS PLANNED FOR THIS VERY

902
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,263
PURPOSE.

903
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,532
THEY DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB

904
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,401
IF IT WASN'T AND THEY SURE

905
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,068
ARRESTED A LOT OF PEOPLE

906
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:51,502
AFTERWARDS.

907
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,504
>> WELL, IT IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT

908
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:56,474
THERE WAS A COUP, AND LIKE MANY

909
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:58,509
COUPS, THEY WERE LED BY

910
00:37:58,509 --> 00:37:59,477
INCOMPETENCE.

911
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:05,850
ERDOGAN HAS LATCHED ONTO

912
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,650
THIS BRILLIANTLY TO STABILIZE

913
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:12,423
HIS INTERNAL POSITION, BUT

914
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:13,123
SO MUCH THAT HE WILL BE A

915
00:38:13,123 --> 00:38:14,558
RUSSIAN ALLY, BUT THAT HE

916
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:15,526
BROUGHT THE U.S. BACK INTO IT.

917
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:20,331
THE ONLY CONSPIRACY WAS THE

918
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,866
GANG COULDN'T SHOOT STRAIGHT.

919
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,800
THE PEOPLE COULDN'T GET IT DONE.

920
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,603
SCARLET: I WANT TO GO BACK TO

921
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,471
THAT IDEA OF THE ALLIANCE

922
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,806
BETWEEN TURKEY AND RUSSIA.

923
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,242
WHAT DID TURKEY GET OUT OF IT,

924
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,244
AND HOW HAS IT PLAYED OFF ITS

925
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:34,211
ALLIANCE WITH THE U.S.?

926
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:39,450
>> WILL, WHAT TURKEY GOT --

927
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,184
WELL, WHAT TURKEY GOT WAS

928
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,786
LEVERAGE WITH THE UNITED

929
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,788
STATES.

930
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:45,389
THEY GOT A NUMBER OF THINGS,

931
00:38:45,389 --> 00:38:48,392
AMONG WHICH IS THIS GUY IN THE

932
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:50,594
UNITED STATES WHO THE TURKS

933
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,328
ACCUSE OF HAVING STARTED THE

934
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,897
COUP.

935
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:55,699
REMEMBER THAT JUST BEFORE THIS,

936
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:56,834
RUSSIA AND TURKEY ALMOST WENT TO

937
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,769
WAR OVER THE TURKISH SHOOTDOWN

938
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:01,172
OF THE RUSSIAN PLANE.

939
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:01,906
SUDDENLY THERE WAS A LOVE

940
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,109
AFFAIR, AND SUDDENLY THE UNITED

941
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,043
STATES HAD TO START REORIENTING

942
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,511
ITSELF, BECAUSE IT NEEDED

943
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:07,945
TURKEY.

944
00:39:07,945 --> 00:39:12,016
AND TURKEY NEEDS THE UNITED

945
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,883
STATES.

946
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,853
RUSSIA IS AN HISTORIC ENEMY OF

947
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,756
TURKEY, IT'S REALLY CLOSE,

948
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:19,990
REALLY COMPETITIVE.

949
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,961
BUT I THINK THE TURKS MANAGED TO

950
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:24,595
REARRANGE THE ENTIRE

951
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:25,062

JOE: DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S WISE

953
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,102

954
00:39:32,102 --> 00:39:34,672
ITSELF WITH THE ERDOGAN

955
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,140
GOVERNMENT?

956
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,608
DO WE REALLY SHARE VALUE

957
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:38,676
SYSTEMS, OR DOES IT NOT MATTER?

958
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:42,380
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT VALUE

959
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,213

960
00:39:43,213 --> 00:39:47,318
AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT

961
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:47,952
RUSSIAN ACCESS TO THE

962
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:48,686
MEDITERRANEAN IS CONTROLLED.

963
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,556
THAT MEANS CONTROLLING THE

964
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,225
-- AND WORKING WITH

965
00:39:55,225 --> 00:39:55,626
TURKEY.

966
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,696
IT DEPENDS WHAT YOU WANT.

967
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,496
IF YOU ONLY WANT TO ALLY WITH

968
00:39:59,496 --> 00:40:01,298

MATT: WHAT ABOUT ISIS?

970
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,005
WE HAVE SEEN REPORTS, AT LEAST,

971
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:11,909
THAT IN THE PAST, ERDOGAN'S

972
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,378
GOVERNMENT HAS SUPPORTED ISIS,

973
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,145
ALTHOUGH NOW IT IS GOING AFTER

974
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:15,512

975
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:18,082
BUT DON'T YOU WANT AN ALLY THAT

976
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,216
DOESN'T SUPPORT TERRORISTS JUST

977
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:20,017
BECAUSE HE HATES HIS NEIGHBOR?

978
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,754
>> STALIN ONCE SUPPORTED

979
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,622

00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,032

00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:23,407
OR TREATING AFRICAN-AMERICANS AS

1125
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:29,245
VICTIMS.

1126
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:29,980
HE IS TRYING TO TURN THE

1127
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:30,547
NARRATIVE AROUND.

1128
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:31,248
WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS VERY

1129
00:47:31,248 --> 00:47:36,153
FORCEFUL NOT EVEN DISSENT, JUST

1130
00:47:36,153 --> 00:47:37,888
HER GOING DIRECTLY AFTER DONALD

1131
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:43,594
TRUMP ON WHAT SHE SEES AS A

1132
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,228
SLEW, ON MANY LEVELS, OF

1133
00:47:45,228 --> 00:47:45,962
QUESTIONABLE AFFILIATIONS,

1134
00:47:45,962 --> 00:47:46,730
BEHAVIORS,, STATEMENTS POLICIES.

1135
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,232
JOE: THOSE OF US WHO ARE ONLINE

1136
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:52,736
ALL THE TIME WHO HAVE SEEN WHAT

1137
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:53,537
SHE IS TALKING ABOUT FOR A LONG

1138
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:58,108
TIME, THE SO-CALLED ALT

1139
00:47:58,108 --> 00:47:58,942
RIGHT, ALL THE FRINGE ELEMENTS.

1140
00:47:58,942 --> 00:48:02,746
IS IT SAFE TO ASSUME THAT MANY

1141
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:03,547
VOTERS ARE COMPLETELY UNFAMILIAR

1142
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:07,317
WITH WHAT BREITBART.COM IS

1143
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:11,455
LIKE, AND THAT THIS SPEECH IS AN

1144
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:15,525
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE MEDIA

1145
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:16,226
SHOWING THIS SIDE OF HIS

1146
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,027
MOVEMENT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC?

1147
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:20,097
>> ABSOLUTELY THAT'S RIGHT.

1148
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:20,931
THERE WAS A TURNING POINT ABOUT

1149
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:24,534
A WEEK AGO WHEN TRUMP ANNOUNCED

1150
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:25,469
THE HIGHER OF STEPHEN BANNON,

1151
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:27,737
WHEN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN TALKED

1152
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:28,505
ABOUT WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO

1153
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:30,674
ADDRESS IT, HOW TO TAKE

1154
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:31,608
ADVANTAGE OF IT, AND WENT TO DO

1155
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:32,476
IT.

1156
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:36,947
AND YOU CAN ALWAYS SEE LABOR DAY

1157
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:37,681
AS THE POINT IN THE ELECTION

1158
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:41,618
CYCLE WHEN VOTERS TURN AWAY FROM

1159
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:42,586
VACATION, GET BACK HOME TO THE

1160
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,353
REALITY OF SENDING THEIR KIDS

1161
00:48:43,353 --> 00:48:44,621
BACK TO SCHOOL, AND INEVITABLY

1162
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,790
FOCUSING ON THE ELECTION.

1163
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,059
THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A TURNING

1164
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:49,860
POINT WHERE YOU WOULD EXPECT TO

1165
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,561
SEE BILL CLINTON AND -- BOTH

1166
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,830
CLINTON AND TRUMP RATCHETING

1167
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:54,531
THEIR CAMPAIGN.

1168
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:59,369
BUT IT WAS STEPHEN BANNON, THE

1169
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,371
REACTION FROM THESE GROUPS, IT

1170
00:49:01,371 --> 00:49:04,374
WAS JUST THERE ON THE TABLE, AND

1171
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,944
SURE ENOUGH, WITH ALL THIS FOCUS

1172
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,380
ON THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, I'M

1173
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,949
SURE THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WAS

1174
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:13,750
HAPPY TO HAVE A REASON TO TURN

1175
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,086
THE NARRATIVE, BUT I DO BELIEVE

1176
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:16,786
IT WAS THE TIMING OF THE

1177
00:49:16,786 --> 00:49:18,788
HIRE THAT REALLY EXPEDITED

1178
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:19,623
THE CONVERSATION.

1179
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,826
SCARLET: AGAINST THE BIGGER

1180
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:23,994
BACKDROP, YOU HAVE PULLED

1181
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:28,698
SHOWING MINORITY VOTERS

1182
00:49:28,698 --> 00:49:29,399
OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTING

1183
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:30,934
HILLARY CLINTON.

1184
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:32,069
HOW CAN TRUMP COMPETE FOR THEIR

1185
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:33,637
SUPPORT, OR IS EVEN TRYING?

1186
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,908
>> CONVENTIONAL WISDOM FOR QUITE

1187
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:44,680
A WHILE HAS HELD THAT OHIO AND

1188
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,582
PENNSYLVANIA, FLORIDA AND NORTH

1189
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,416
CAROLINA TO SOME DEGREE, WILL BE

1190
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,083
THE PIVOTAL STATES IN THE

1191
00:49:47,083 --> 00:49:47,517
SELECTION.

1192
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,285
WHAT YOU HAVE IS SOME POCKETS OF

1193
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:49,786
VOTERS THAT HILLARY CLINTON

1194
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:50,453
WOULD WANT TO TURN OUT,

1195
00:49:50,453 --> 00:49:53,256
PARTICULARLY JACKSONVILLE,

1196
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:53,823
PHILADELPHIA.

1197
00:49:53,823 --> 00:49:57,794
BUT FOR TRUMP, THE ISSUE IS

1198
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:03,300
TRYING TO MAXIMIZE WHITE VOTERS,

1199
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,000
INCLUDING CENTRIST WHITE OR

1200
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,002
RIGHT-LEANING VOTERS WHO WILL

1201
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,137
BACK HIM.

1202
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:09,339
IS THAT CONCERN HE IS TRYING TO

1203
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,141
ADDRESS IN HIS REMARKS,

1204
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:11,942
OSTENSIBLY TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS,

1205
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:13,977
TO BRING SOME REASSURANCE TO

1206
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:15,679
WHITE AMERICAN VOTERS WHO ARE

1207
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,647
NOT ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE WITH

THEY DO IT TO CAREFULLY, IT WILL

00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,694
HAVE SIDE EFFECTS.

A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT THE

1232
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,538
PUSH FOR HELICOPTER MONEY WILL

1233
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:29,339
BE IF THE YEN CROSSES A CERTAIN

1234
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,073
LEVEL.

1235
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:30,940
BETTY: YOU HAVE THE NAIL ON THE

HEAD.

1237
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:33,743
WHAT MARK MOBIUS SAID THAT WAS

1238
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,546
SO INTERESTING, HE'S SAYING,

1239
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,515
THEY ARE GOING TO DO IT, BUT

1240
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:39,349
IT'S LIKELY NOT GOING TO HAVE

1241
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,750
THE DESIRED EFFECT, SO WHY DO IT

1242
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:41,384
AT ALL?

1243
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,887
MATT: TYPICAL BANK OF JAPAN

1244
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,456
POLICY, IS IN THAT HOW THEY

1245
00:53:46,456 --> 00:53:47,924
DO IT?

1246
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,294
THEY DOESN'T REALLY BRING IT

1247
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,529
WITH THEIR FISCAL POLICY.

1248
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,665
SCARLET: THAT REMINDS ME OF

ANOTHER CENTRAL-BANK.

1250
00:53:56,933 --> 00:53:58,067
BUT WHY DID I HAVE TO DO IT?

1251
00:53:58,067 --> 00:54:01,471
LIKE YOU SAID, BECAUSE THE YEN

1252
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,139
CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN, AND

1253
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,308
WHAT MARK MOBIUS WAS SAYING WAS

1254
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:10,980
IF IT HITS AND CROSSES THAT ¥90

1255
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,782
PER DOLLAR LEVEL, THAT WILL

1256
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,752
LIKELY BE --

1257
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:29,933
MATT: WASN'T 100 GOING TO BE THE

1258
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:30,700
BIG ONE, AND THERE WERE HEDGES

1259
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,100
AT 100?

1260
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,868
IS IT NOW GETTING RATCHETED DOWN

1261
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:32,135

1262
00:54:32,135 --> 00:54:32,902

1263
00:54:32,902 --> 00:54:33,870
AT SOME POINT, WHAT'S

1264
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:36,005
INTERESTING, WASN'T 100 GOING TE

1265
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:36,639
BIG ONE, THIS PHRASE

1266
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:37,340
HELICOPTER MONEY IS A PHRASE

1267
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:37,974
THAT WON'T GO AWAY.

1268
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:41,911
THE BOJ GOVERNOR KURODA WAS

1269
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:42,679
ASKED THIS BY THE BBC -- YOU

1270
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:44,281
GUYS ARE EVER THIS?

1271
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,181
LET'S JUST REMIND OUR VIEWERS

1272
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:46,816
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THIS.

1273
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:57,060
>> A POLICY -- 

1274
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,696
I DON'T THINK AT THIS STAGE WE

1275
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:01,798
SHOULD ABANDON THIS

1276
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,966
INSTITUTIONAL SETTING.

1277
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:06,302
THERE'S NO POSSIBILITY FOR

1278
00:55:06,302 --> 00:55:07,003
HELICOPTER MONEY.

1279
00:55:07,003 --> 00:55:10,173
BETTY: NO POSSIBILITY.

1280
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:11,641
BUT HE ALSO SAID "AT THIS

1281
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,075
STAGE."

1282
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:14,344
IT'S MIXED MESSAGING.

1283
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:18,248
MATT: YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY THE

1284
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,015
POSSIBILITY COMPLETELY, RIGHT?

1285
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:22,285
JOE: THERE IS STILL THE ISSUE OF

1286
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,019
THE FACT THAT HELICOPTER MONEY

1287
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,154
HAS TO INVOLVE COORDINATION

1288
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:26,589
BETWEEN THE BANK OF JAPAN AND

1289
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:31,060
THE FISCAL AUTHORITY, WHERE YOU

1290
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:31,828
CLEARLY EXPRESS RESERVATIONS

1291
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,096
ABOUT THAT COORDINATION

1292
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,064
REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITIONS.

1293
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,600
BETTY: RIGHT.

1294
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,401
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

1295
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:39,202
MUCH THEY ARE ON THE SAME PAGE

1296
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:42,305
AND WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE

1297
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:43,640
MORE FISCAL REFORM BEFORE

1298
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,507
IMPLEMENTING ANY TYPE OF FURTHER

1299
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:44,908
EASING.

1300
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:45,341
ABSOLUTELY.

1301
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,709
WE WILL SEE.

1488
01:05:43,706 --> 01:05:44,974
OUT THERE.

1489
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:45,774
THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO

1490
01:05:45,774 --> 01:05:47,843
WORK WITH, AND WHAT SHE IS

1491
01:05:47,843 --> 01:05:51,948
TRYING TO DO IS SAY, TO REGULAR

1492
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,016
REPUBLICANS, MORE TRADITIONAL

1493
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,252
REPUBLICANS, YOU DON'T WANT TO

1494
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:56,986
BE IN BED WITH THESE PEOPLE.

1495
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:59,388
ALEX: AND THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE

1496
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:00,122
BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE TRYING TO

1497
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,324
SPEAK TO.

1498
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:02,191
NORMAL REPUBLICANS WHO FEEL LIKE

1499
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,092
THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE IN THE

1500
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:05,161
TRUNK CAMPAIGN -- THE TRUMP

1501
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:07,029
CAMPAIGN.

1502
01:06:07,029 --> 01:06:09,265
HILLARY CLINTON'S SPEECH TODAY

1503
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:09,965
WAS DIRECTED AT MODERATE

1504
01:06:09,965 --> 01:06:13,268
REPUBLICANS.

1505
01:06:13,268 --> 01:06:18,174
JOHN: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

1506
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:18,974
BEFORE -- DONALD TRUMP TALKING

1507
01:06:18,974 --> 01:06:19,942
ABOUT COLLEGE-EDUCATED WOMEN,

1508
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:20,843
OSTENSIBLY TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS.

1509
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:24,280
THAT IS OF THAT SPEECH IS ABOUT.

1510
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,014
THIS IS GETTING A TON OF

1511
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:29,719
COVERAGE, BUT THE REAL INTENDED

1512
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:33,889
MESSAGE, DON'T LET YOU SUBURBAN

1513
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:34,890
WHITE WOMEN OF PHILADELPHIA BE

1514
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:36,225
FOOLED.

1515
01:06:36,225 --> 01:06:38,461
REMEMBER, NOT JUST WHAT HE HAS

1516
01:06:38,461 --> 01:06:39,261
SAID THAT THE PEOPLE HE HAS

1517
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:39,962
SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH.

1518
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,631
ALEX: WHEN PEOPLE SHOW WHO

1519
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,167
THEY ARE, BELIEVE THEM.

1520
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,269
A NEW NATIONAL POLL CAME OUT

1521
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,103
TODAY, SHOWING HILLARY CLINTON

1522
01:06:48,103 --> 01:06:51,774
LEADING BY 10 POINTS, 51% TO

1523
01:06:51,774 --> 01:06:52,208
41%.

1524
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,910
BUT IT WAS ANOTHER SURVEY THAT

1525
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:58,814
REALLY CAUGHT OUR EYE,

1526
01:06:58,814 --> 01:06:59,548
SUGGESTING THAT ASPECTS OF

1527
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,150
DONALD TRUMP'S INTEGRATION PLAN

1528
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:01,951
ARE OUT OF STEP WITH MANY OF THE

1529
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:05,287
NATION'S VOTERS.

1530
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:06,088
61% SAY THEY OPPOSE BUILDING A

1531
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:08,657
WALL ON THE U.S.-MEXICO BORDER,

1532
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:11,594
WHICH IS MAYBE WHY TRUMP SEEMS

1533
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:13,162
TO BE ABOUT AS CONFUSED AS

1534
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:13,963
EVERYONE ELSE WHEN IT COMES TO

1535
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:14,730
HIS NEW POSTURE ON IMMIGRATION.

1536
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:15,998
IN A FOX NEWS TOWN HALL THAT

1537
01:07:15,998 --> 01:07:20,436
AIRED LAST NIGHT, THE REPUBLICAN

1538
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,203
NOMINEE PLAYFULLY ASKED THE

1539
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,037
AUDIENCE THREE TIMES TO VOTE ON

1540
01:07:22,037 --> 01:07:25,040
HOW TO HANDLE THE ESTIMATED 11

1541
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,808
MILLION UNDOCUMENTED MEN AND

1542
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:26,508
WOMEN LIVING IN THE UNITED

1543
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:27,176
STATES.

1544
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:30,346
IN WHAT JENNA JOHNSON OF "THE

1545
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:32,214
WASHINGTON POST" DESCRIBED AS

1546
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,050
"GAME SHOW STYLE POLLS ON THE

1547
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:35,718
STATE OF HUMAN BEINGS."

1548
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,487
SO HAS TRUMP CHANGED HIS

1549
01:07:38,487 --> 01:07:40,522
POSITIONS

1550
01:07:40,522 --> 01:07:41,490
S?

1551
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,260
AS ALWAYS, WE TURN TO KATRINA

1552
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:44,660
PEARSON.

1553
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:47,530
>> HE HASN'T CHANGED HIS

1554
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,364
POSITION, HE HAS CHANGED THE

1555
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:48,964
WORDS HE IS SAYING.

1556
01:07:48,964 --> 01:07:52,768
ALEX: IN THIS CASE SHE IS

1557
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:53,636
RIGHT,, AT LEAST ABOUT HIS WORD

1558
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:54,036
CHANGE.

1559
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:58,707
HERE'S THE EVOLUTION OF HIS

1560
01:07:58,707 --> 01:07:59,541
STANCE ON THE ISSUE OVER THE

1561
01:07:59,541 --> 01:08:00,075
PAST FEW MONTHS.

1562
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:02,044
>> YOU HAVE TO GO OUT, AND THEY

1563
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:02,978
WILL COME BACK --

1564
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:07,449
>> COME ON, WE KNOW YOU CAN'T

1565
01:08:07,449 --> 01:08:08,150
PICK THEM UP AND SHIP THEM

1566
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:08,684
ACROSS THE BORDER.

1567
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:09,752
IT'S A SILLY ARGUMENT.

1568
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,021
>> DWIGHT EISENHOWER.

1569
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,423
THEY MOVED 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE

1570
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:15,491
OUT.

1571
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:16,258
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

1572
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,295
>> ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A

1573
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:20,029
MASSIVE DEPORTATION?

1574
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:22,298
>> WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

1575
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,399
DEPORTATION FORCE, AND WE WILL

1576
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:24,933
DO IT HUMANELY.

1577
01:08:24,933 --> 01:08:27,202
>> IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT, WHAT

1578
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:30,706
WILL YOU DO FOR THOSE MEMBERS OF

1579
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:31,473
OUR COUNTRY WHO HAVE BEEN HERE

1580
01:08:31,473 --> 01:08:32,441
FOR 25 YEARS UNDOCUMENTED?

1581
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:37,046
>> THEY ARE GOING TO GO, AND WE

1582
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:37,912
ARE GOING TO CREATE A PATH WHERE

1583
01:08:37,912 --> 01:08:38,613
WE CAN GET THEM INTO THIS

1584
01:08:38,613 --> 01:08:39,881
COUNTRY LEGALLY.

1585
01:08:39,881 --> 01:08:40,749
OTHERWISE, WE DON'T HAVE A

1586
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,017
COUNTRY.

1587
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:45,787
THEY ARE GOING TO COME BACK --

1588
01:08:45,787 --> 01:08:46,587
SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN IN THE

1589
01:08:46,587 --> 01:08:48,424
COUNTRY FOR 20 YEARS, AS A JOB,

1590
01:08:48,424 --> 01:08:49,992
OK.

1591
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,361
DO WE TAKE HIM AS A FAMILY AND

1592
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:53,496
SEND THEM OUT?

1593
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:59,734
THEY OWE TAXES, THEY HAVE TO PAY

1594
01:08:59,734 --> 01:09:00,202
TAXES.

1595
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,437
ALEX: THIS IS NOT THE ONLY

1596
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,772
POSITION TRUMP TOOK DURING THE

1597
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:05,941
NOMINATION CONTEST THAT NOW

1598
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:06,975
SEEMS TO BE UNTENABLE.

1599
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:10,078
LAST NIGHT ON RACHEL MADDOW,

1600
01:09:10,078 --> 01:09:11,814
KELLYANNE CONWAY STRUGGLED TO

1601
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:12,613
RECTIFY HER BOSS'S ORIGINAL

1602
01:09:12,613 --> 01:09:14,850
MUSLIM THAN WITH HIS CURRENT

1603
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:18,386
PROPOSAL, AND SHE COULD NOT

1604
01:09:18,386 --> 01:09:19,688
SPECIFY EXACTLY WHO TRUMP IS

1605
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:20,488
APOLOGIZING TO WHEN HE EXPRESSED

1606
01:09:20,488 --> 01:09:21,724
REGRET LAST WEEK.

1607
01:09:21,724 --> 01:09:23,392
HE AND HIS CAMPAIGN SEEM TO BE

1608
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:27,662
FACING TWO UNPALATABLE CHOICES,

1609
01:09:27,662 --> 01:09:28,497
EITHER DOUBLE DOWN ON UNPOPULAR

1610
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,765
POLICIES OR RISK BEING LABELED

1611
01:09:30,765 --> 01:09:32,268
AS FLIP FLOPPER'S.

1612
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,001
JOHN, WHICH ONE TO CHOOSE?

1613
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:36,971
JOHN: A LOT OF POLITICIANS TRY

1614
01:09:36,971 --> 01:09:38,274
TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

1615
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,142
IS A TIME-HONORED TRADITION AND

1616
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:42,444
POLITICS.

1617
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,278
THESE ARE EGREGIOUS EFFORTS TO

1618
01:09:43,278 --> 01:09:46,814
HAVE IT BOTH WAYS, TO SAY WHAT

1619
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:48,783
KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID, WELL,

1620
01:09:48,783 --> 01:09:50,051
LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM.

1621
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:51,987
THEY ARE ALL PART OF A

1622
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:53,923
CONTINUUM.

1623
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:57,726
HE EXPRESSED REGRET IN GENERAL,

1624
01:09:57,726 --> 01:09:58,560
SO ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN OFFENDED

1625
01:09:58,560 --> 01:09:59,361
SHOULD TAKE THAT AS AN APOLOGY.

1626
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:02,831
THEN THIS IMMIGRATION THING,

1627
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:03,632
WHICH IS THE FLIP-FLOP TO END

1628
01:10:03,632 --> 01:10:05,301
ALL FLIP-FLOPS.

1629
01:10:05,301 --> 01:10:08,103
BEFORE I WAS AGAINST THE WAR, IT

1630
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,872
MAKES THAT LOOK LIKE

1631
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:10,339
MATCHSTICKS.

1632
01:10:10,339 --> 01:10:14,443
I DON'T KNOW WHICH HE BELIEVES.

1633
01:10:14,443 --> 01:10:16,145
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE BELIEVES.

1634
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:20,082
HE MAY BELIEVE NOTHING ABOUT IT,

1635
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:20,816
BUT I THINK THAT IS SUCH AN

1636
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,117
EGREGIOUS FLIP-FLOP THAT HE WILL

1637
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:25,588
PAY A TERRIBLE PRICE FOR IT.

1638
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:26,422
IT WILL BE ON THE FAR RIGHT IN

1639
01:10:26,422 --> 01:10:27,423
THE MIDDLE WHO REMEMBER WHAT HE

1640
01:10:27,423 --> 01:10:27,856
SAID.

1641
01:10:27,856 --> 01:10:30,893
ALEX: AND KEEP IN MIND, IN THAT

1642
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:31,894
INTERVIEW THAT KELLYANNE CONWAY

1643
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,196
BRAVELY DID, BECAUSE IT IS

1644
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:38,300
ALMOST AN IMPOSSIBLE

1645
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:41,970
POSITION, AT ONE POINT, UP POPS

1646
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:46,241
THE TRUMP LETTERHEAD, THE

1647
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:46,942
COMPLETE AND TOTAL BAN ON

1648
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:47,676
MUSLIMS ENTERING THE UNITED

1649
01:10:47,676 --> 01:10:50,179
STATES, WRITTEN BY DONALD TRUMP,

1650
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:50,979
RELEASED TO THE NATIONAL PRESS.

1651
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:54,216
THIS IS THE PRICE YOU PAY.

1652
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:58,921
YOU CANNOT ETCH-A-SKETCH AWAY

1653
01:10:58,921 --> 01:10:59,688
SOMETHING WRITTEN ON YOUR OWN

1654
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:00,122
LETTERHEAD.

1655
01:11:00,122 --> 01:11:01,156
JOHN: THROWBACK THURSDAY.

1656
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:03,559
ALEX: THERE IS NO NUANCE.

1657
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,527
AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM FOR THE

1658
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:05,994
CAMPAIGN.

1659
01:11:05,994 --> 01:11:08,897
JOHN: I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE

1660
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:12,134
-- IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW TOXIC

1661
01:11:12,134 --> 01:11:16,271
A POSITION HE TOOK IS, THE

1662
01:11:16,271 --> 01:11:19,274
BETTER THING TO ME, IF YOU HAVE

1663
01:11:19,274 --> 01:11:21,109
TO BE LABELED A FLIP FLOPPER, IS

1664
01:11:21,109 --> 01:11:22,478
ACTUALLY FLIP-FLOP.

1665
01:11:22,478 --> 01:11:24,513
SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS WRONG

1666
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:27,416
BEFORE, I HAVE TALKED TO PEOPLE,

1667
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:28,250
I HAVE COME TO A DIFFERENT POINT

1668
01:11:28,250 --> 01:11:28,617

1669
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:29,752
JUST ADMIT IT.

1670
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:33,422
YOU WILL TAKE A HIT, BUT AT

1671
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:34,189
LEAST HE WILL BE PAINTED AS

1672
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:34,890
SOMEONE TRYING TO DO WHAT IT

1673
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:36,592
SEEMS LIKE, WHICH IS TO PRETEND

1674
01:11:36,592 --> 01:11:38,694
LIKE ALL THAT STUFF ON WHICH HIS

1675
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:39,394
CAMPAIGN WAS BUILT NEVER

1676
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:39,828
HAPPENED.

1677
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:42,798
ALEX: RIGHT.

1678
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,200
ALSO, THEY MUST HAVE SOME KIND

1679
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:46,034
OF INTERNAL NUMBERS THAT SUGGEST

1680
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:53,475
TO THEM IF THEY FORSAKE THESE

1681
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,209
BASE VOTERS, WHO ARE VERY

1682
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:54,977
EXCITED ABOUT THE WALL INTO THE

1683
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:55,944
BAN, THEY PLUMMET TO A LEVEL

1684
01:11:55,944 --> 01:11:56,745
FROM WHICH IT IS UNRECOVERABLE.

1685
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:57,913
JOHN: YES.

1686
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,115
AND I THINK THEY ARE BETTING THE

1687
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:00,916
PEOPLE WHO LOVE DONALD TRUMP

1688
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:02,718
WON'T GO ANYWHERE, THAT THEY

1689
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:03,519
WILL STAY AND PUT UP WITH WHAT

1690
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:07,956
SEEMS TO BE -- HE CAN BACK AWAY

1691
01:12:07,956 --> 01:12:09,825
FROM ANYTHING, THAT HE CAN'T

1692
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:10,959
PIVOT AWAY FROM IMMIGRATION.

1693
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:11,760
THEY ARE BETTING THAT AND

1694
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,463
CULTURE IS AN OUTLIER -- THAT

1695
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:19,001
ANN COULTER IS AN OUTLIER.

1696
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:19,835
BUT HE IS PUTTING HIMSELF IN A

1697
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:20,569
HORRIBLE PLACE POLITICALLY.

THE DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN SEEMS

TO BE SUGGESTING THAT THE SPEECH

1719
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:19,715
FROM HER WORST WEEK IN POLITICS.

1720
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:21,116

1721
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:22,651
-- THE WHEELS ARE COMING OFF HIS

1722
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:23,485
CAMPAIGN, HE IS ON HIS THIRD

1723
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:25,821

1724
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:26,555
HIRES THE BEST PEOPLE IN THE

01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,324

1727
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:31,893
WHERE THE ISSUES HAVE TO BE PUT

1728
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:32,494
FRONT AND CENTER.

1729
01:15:32,494 --> 01:15:34,596
HE'S IN TRYING TO MAKE SOME

1730
01:15:34,596 --> 01:15:37,633
STATEMENTS.

1731
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,669
WHETHER HE HAS BEEN FED THEM BY

01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:42,604

1734
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:46,942

1735
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:48,143
ON POSITIONS HE HAS TAKEN THAT

1736
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,378

WILL HOLD HIM TO ACCOUNT FOR THE

1739
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,083
NEXT 75 DAYS.

1740
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:56,017
JOHN: IS DONALD TRUMP A RACIST?

1741
01:15:56,017 --> 01:15:58,353
>> YOU KNOW, WHEN THIS FIRST

1742
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:00,822
CAME UP AND HILLARY CLINTON SAID

1743
01:16:00,822 --> 01:16:04,126
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK THAT'S AN

1744
01:16:04,126 --> 01:16:06,028
ACCURATE STATEMENT.

1745
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:06,895
BELOW WE DO KNOW IS HE HAS MADE

1746
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:07,429
RACIST COMMENTS.

1747
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:11,800
PAUL RYAN SAID HIS COMMENTS

1748
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:12,467
ABOUT THE JUDGE WITH THE

1749
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:13,068
DEFINITION OF RACISM.

1750
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,704
WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN HAULED INTO

1751
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,739
COURT BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

1752
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:18,840
FOR ENGAGING IN HOUSING

1753
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,575
DISCRIMINATION, STAMPING THE

1754
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:24,780
LETTER C ON THEIR HOUSING

1755
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:25,547
APPLICATION BECAUSE THEY ARE

1756
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:26,248
AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR LATINO,

1757
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:26,915
THOSE ACTIONS ARE RACIST.

1758
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:33,055
JOHN: RACISM -- GENERALLY THEY A

1759
01:16:33,055 --> 01:16:34,890
REN'T ACTIONS.

1760
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,626
IF YOU MAKE RACIST STATEMENTS,

1761
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:38,360
IS THAT NOT THE DEFINITION OF

1762
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:38,860
BEING A RACIST?

1763
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:41,296
>> I WILL LET YOU JUDGE THAT.

1764
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,130
I DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT

1765
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:42,564
JUDGMENT.

1766
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:45,734
WHAT I FEEL COMFORTABLE

1767
01:16:45,734 --> 01:16:46,902
SAYING AND DOING IS HOLDING UP

1768
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:49,738
ALL THE HATEFUL STATEMENTS THAT

1769
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:51,506
HE HAS ENGAGED IN, THAT HE HAS

1770
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:56,144
PARTICIPATED IN, AND THE PEOPLE

1771
01:16:56,144 --> 01:17:03,185
THAT HE IS TRAFFICKING.

1772
01:17:03,185 --> 01:17:03,952
HILLARY CLINTON MADE A POINT

1773
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:04,719
TODAY -- HE TOOK A TWEET FROM A

1774
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:05,487
KNOWN WHITE SUPREMACIST, RACIST

1775
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:06,388
GUY, TAKES A GUY WITH A DOZEN

1776
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,155
FOLLOWERS AND TWEETED OUT FOR

1777
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:07,722
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

1778
01:17:07,722 --> 01:17:10,158
IT'S BEHAVIOR THAT FLIES IN THE

1779
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:10,959
FACE OF OUR VALUES AS AMERICANS,

1780
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:12,627
AND AS A COUNTRY.

1781
01:17:12,627 --> 01:17:16,031
JOHN: ONE QUICK FOLLOW-UP.

1782
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:17,899
DONALD TRUMP'S FOLLOWERS, IS

1783
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:18,700
VOTERS.

1784
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:25,440
-- HIS VOTERS.

1785
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,274
IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF HIS

1786
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,876
SUPPORT FROM OUR A RACIST,S IS

1787
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:28,643
THAT IS YOUR VIEW?

1788
01:17:28,643 --> 01:17:31,213
>> THERE ARE A BUNCH OF REASONS

1789
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:34,416
WHY PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY VOTING

1790
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,250
FOR DONALD TRUMP.

1791
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:36,918
I WILL NOT TRY AND QUANTIFY

1792
01:17:36,918 --> 01:17:39,187
ANYTHING ABOUT HIS SUPPORTERS.

1793
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:39,921
I THINK WE KNOW THAT IN A

1794
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,991
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, THERE ARE

1795
01:17:42,991 --> 01:17:43,725
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY

1796
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:44,559
DON'T AGREE WITH WHAT HE SAYS

1797
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:47,596
AND THEY ARE VOTING FOR HIM.

1798
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:48,396
BUT I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

1799
01:17:48,396 --> 01:17:49,865
PEOPLE WHO ARE APPALLED AT MANY

1800
01:17:49,865 --> 01:17:52,200
OF THE THINGS HE SAID AND I

1801
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:52,934
THINK WE WILL KEEP SPEAKING TO

1802
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:53,435
THOSE VOTERS.

1803
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:58,173
WHEN THE OTHER TEAM'S  STUDENTS

1804
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:02,310
ARE SHOUTING "BUILD THAT WALL"

1805
01:18:02,310 --> 01:18:07,215
-- YOU HAVE TO BE THE LEADER

1806
01:18:07,215 --> 01:18:09,017
AND DONALD TRUMP HAS PROVEN HE

1807
01:18:09,017 --> 01:18:09,885
IS TEMPERAMENTALLY UNFIT TO BE

1808
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:13,655
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

1809
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:14,489
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY AND

1810
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:15,223
WHAT HILLARY CLINTON TALKED

1811
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:15,924
ABOUT TODAY, THIS IS PART OF

1812
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:18,393
THAT STORY.

1813
01:18:18,393 --> 01:18:19,261
WHEN YOU'RE DIVIDING PEOPLE,

1814
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,228
USING THOSE COMMENTS, YOU ARE

1815
01:18:20,228 --> 01:18:20,896
NOT FIT TO BE PRESIDENT.

1816
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:24,132
ALEX: WAS THERE ANY TREPIDATION

1817
01:18:24,132 --> 01:18:24,900
ABOUT USING THE IMAGE OF THE

1818
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:25,634
CLAN MEMBER IN A CAMPAIGN AD?

1819
01:18:25,634 --> 01:18:29,337
>> I THINK IT WAS THE VIDEO THAT

1820
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:30,872
GOT RELEASED TODAY -- A WEB

1821
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:32,174
VIDEO.

1822
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:35,076
YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS THAT WHEN

1823
01:18:35,076 --> 01:18:38,213
YOU ALIGN WITH SOME OF THE

1824
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:39,180
PEOPLE HE HAS ALIGNED WITH,

1825
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:44,953
STEPHEN BANNON, BREITBART, WHERE

1826
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:45,754
THEY HAVE CREATED A HOME BASE

1827
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:46,554
FOR THESE PEOPLE, RECIRCULATING

1828
01:18:46,554 --> 01:18:55,630
THEIR GARBAGE, AND DONALD TRUMP

1829
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:56,331
STARTS RECIRCULATING THEIR

1830
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,065
GARBAGE, THE CONTENT OF THE

1831
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:57,699
VIDEO SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.

1832
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:58,533
YOU SHOULDN'T BE TRAFFICKING IN

1833
01:18:58,533 --> 01:18:58,967
THAT STUFF.

1834
01:18:58,967 --> 01:18:59,701
AND IF YOU ARE A PRESIDENTIAL

1835
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:00,402
CANDIDATE OF THE REPUBLICAN

1836
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:00,969
PARTY, I THINK IT IS

1837
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:01,703
DISGRACEFUL.

1838
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,371
, AGAIN IT SHOWS HE IS UNFIT TO

1839
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,874
BE PRESIDENT, AND IT IS FAIR

1840
01:19:05,874 --> 01:19:06,374
GAME TO SAY --

1841
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:08,443
ALEX: THERE WAS NO TREPIDATION?

1842
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:12,180
>> I THINK YOU HAVE

1843
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,282
CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING,

1844
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:17,052
BUT LET'S BE CLEAR.

1845
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:17,886
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A GUY WHO

1846
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:18,653
LOOKED INTO THE CAMERA WHEN HE

1847
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:21,022
WAS ASKED ABOUT DAVID DUKE, AND

1848
01:19:21,022 --> 01:19:23,959
DAVID DUKE SUPPORTING HIM, AND

1849
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:26,661
DAVID DUKE'S STROKING HIS FAVOR,

1850
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:27,595
AND SAYING I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

1851
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:30,065
ABOUT DAVID DUKE.

1852
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:30,765
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE A

1853
01:19:30,765 --> 01:19:31,533
70-YEAR-OLD MAN RUNNING FOR

1854
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:32,634
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

1855
01:19:32,634 --> 01:19:33,468
DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

1856
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:33,902
DAVID DUKE?

1857
01:19:33,902 --> 01:19:36,604
OF A MAN WHO SAID LAST WEEK, I

1858
01:19:36,604 --> 01:19:38,573
WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU THE TRUTH?

1859
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:39,307
HE KNOWS EVERYTHING HE HAS TO

1860
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,776
KNOW ABOUT TRAY THE DUKE, AND TO

1861
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:42,610
TRAFFIC AND IT MAKES IT WORSE.

1862
01:19:42,610 --> 01:19:44,012
JOHN: LET ME ASK A POLITICAL

1863
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:47,582
QUESTION.

1864
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:51,620
STRATEGY QUESTION.

1865
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:52,420
YOU GUYS HAVE RUN MILLIONS OF

1866
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:54,790
DOLLARS OF ADS IN THIS CAMPAIGN.

1867
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:56,324
MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT.

1868
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:57,258
BUT THEY HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IS

1869
01:19:57,258 --> 01:20:01,596
THIS STUFF.

1870
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:02,297
THEY TALKED ABOUT HIS

1871
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,098
TEMPERAMENT, HIS PIVOT, IS LACK

1872
01:20:03,098 --> 01:20:07,402
OF QUALIFICATIONS.

1873
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,303
BUT YOU HAVEN'T GONE AFTER HIM

1874
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,104
IN THE WAY YOU HAVE IN THIS WEB

1875
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:09,437
VIDEO.

1876
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:11,506
THAT KIND OF STUFF, IN PAID

1877
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:11,973
ADVERTISING?

1878
01:20:11,973 --> 01:20:16,644
>> THERE HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING

1879
01:20:16,644 --> 01:20:17,779
ABOUT ODIE'S COMMENTARY.

1880
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,716
JOHN: NOT FEATURING A KLANSMAN.

1881
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:27,288
>> THERE HAS BEEN FEATURING OF

1882
01:20:27,288 --> 01:20:28,056
HIS HIDEOUS LANGUAGE TOWARDS

1883
01:20:28,056 --> 01:20:30,125
WOMEN, CALLING WOMEN PIGS,

1884
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,726
DISGUSTING, BLOCKING A DISABLED

1885
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:34,362
REPORTER --

1886
01:20:34,362 --> 01:20:36,031
JOHN: I'M NOT SAYING IT HASN'T

1887
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:36,798
BEEN TOUGH, BUT WILL WE START

1888
01:20:36,798 --> 01:20:37,499
SEEING IMAGERY LIKE THIS,

1889
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,134
FEATURING A KLANSMAN?

1890
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:42,270
>> I AM NOT GOING TO TELL YOU

1891
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:43,471
WHAT WE WILL SHOW IN THE FUTURE.

1892
01:20:43,471 --> 01:20:44,906
WHAT I WILL SAY IS WE WILL KEEP

1893
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,142
HIGHLIGHTING -- THE MORE HATEFUL

1894
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:48,610
HIS STATEMENTS ARE, AND THEY

1895
01:20:48,610 --> 01:20:51,913
CONTINUE TO BE SO, HIS SPEECH

1896
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:52,647
LAST WEEK TO AFRICAN-AMERICANS

1897
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:55,050
WAS A DISGRACE, HE CONTINUES TO

1898
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:55,850
DENIGRATE AND STEREOTYPE IN THE

1899
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:57,819
WORST WAY A POPULATION THAT IS

1900
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:59,287
STILL STRUGGLING FOR EQUALITY,

1901
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,956
BUT ALSO MAKING GAINS, BUILDING

1902
01:21:01,956 --> 01:21:04,993
COMMUNITIES, EDUCATING KIDS IN

1903
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:09,164
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD -- WE ARE

1904
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:09,998
GOING TO HIGHLIGHT THE HATEFUL

1905
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:10,732
STATEMENTS HE MAKES TO WHOEVER

1906
01:21:10,732 --> 01:21:11,232
THEY ARE ABOUT.

1907
01:21:11,232 --> 01:21:12,400
ALEX: WE HAVE SO MANY MORE

1908
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,034
QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

1909
01:21:13,034 --> 01:21:14,602
>> I WILL HANG AROUND.

1910
01:21:14,602 --> 01:21:17,072
ALEX: WE WILL COME BACK RIGHT

1911
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:17,872
AFTER THIS COMMERCIAL BREAK AND

1912
01:21:17,872 --> 01:21:18,973
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION.

1913
01:21:18,973 --> 01:21:19,707
♪

1914
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:44,285
JOHN: WE ARE BACK WITH JOEL

1915
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,119
BENENSON, THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN

1916
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:45,720
CHIEF STRATEGIST.

1917
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,822
THANKS FOR STICKING AROUND.

1918
01:23:47,822 --> 01:23:49,357
I WANT TO ASK YOU -- I DON'T

1919
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,159
WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON

1920
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:52,761
FOUNDATIONS.

1921
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:53,528
BUT I DO WANT TO ASK YOU A

1922
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:56,064
POLITICAL QUESTION.

1923
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:56,898
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS YELL AT US

1924
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:58,766
AND SAY, NO ONE CARES ABOUT

1925
01:23:58,766 --> 01:24:00,869
THESE MATTERS, NO ONE CARES.

1926
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,438
ALL THE POLLING I HAVE SEEN,

1927
01:24:03,438 --> 01:24:04,205
INCLUDING THE NATIONAL POLLING

1928
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:07,976
BLOOMBERG DID, WHICH SHOWS THAT

1929
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:08,810
MORE THAN HALF OF THE COUNTRY IS

1930
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:09,577
BOTHERED A LOT BY THE DONATIONS

1931
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:15,016
TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, MORE

1932
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:15,817
THAN HALF THE COUNTRY IS WORRIED

1933
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:16,551
ABOUT THE WAY SHE HANDLED HER

1934
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,318
E-MAILS, IT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT

1935
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:18,019
IT IS NOT TRUE THAT NO ONE

1936
01:24:18,019 --> 01:24:18,353
CARES.

1937
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:20,822
A DECENT CHUNK OF PEOPLE DO.

1938
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:22,891
YOU ARE A NUMBERS GUY.

1939
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:23,691
IS THIS REALLY AN ISSUE THAT

1940
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:27,428
BOTHERS NO ONE, OR THAT BOTHERS

1941
01:24:27,428 --> 01:24:28,496
NO REMAINING AVAILABLE VOTES?

1942
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,999
>> THAT POINT YOU MADE IS ONE

1943
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:34,902
THAT'S TRUE, AND I AM NOT GOING

1944
01:24:34,902 --> 01:24:35,670
TO JUDGE WHAT VOTERS THINK OR

1945
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,572
DON'T THINK ABOUT THE ISSUES.

1946
01:24:37,572 --> 01:24:39,173
BUT IT DOES SAY THAT YOU HAVE

1947
01:24:39,173 --> 01:24:40,375
LOOKED AT POLL NUMBERS AS WELL

1948
01:24:40,375 --> 01:24:41,209
-- THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE LEFT TO

1949
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:42,210
HAVEN'T MADE UP THEIR MIND.

1950
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:43,378
WE'RE COMPETING FOR THOSE VOTES

1951
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:47,048
AND VERY HARD, BUT AT THE SAME

1952
01:24:47,048 --> 01:24:47,815
TIME YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR OWN

1953
01:24:47,815 --> 01:24:48,182
VOTE.

1954
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:50,385
THIS IS AN ISSUE WE HAVE

1955
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:51,185
ADDRESSED IN THE LAST COUPLE

1956
01:24:51,185 --> 01:24:51,519
DAYS.

1957
01:24:51,519 --> 01:24:52,220
HILLARY CLINTON ADDRESSED IT

1958
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,789
AGAIN LAST NIGHT, SAYING NO

1959
01:24:54,789 --> 01:24:58,326
EXCUSES, REMINDING PEOPLE THAT

1960
01:24:58,326 --> 01:24:59,127
HE YEAR AGO SHE APOLOGIZED THAT

1961
01:24:59,127 --> 01:24:59,927
IT WASN'T THE RIGHT DECISION.

1962
01:24:59,927 --> 01:25:01,329
I THINK WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT

1963
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:06,034
10 WEEKS, I THINK VOTERS ARE

1964
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:06,801
GOING TO LISTEN TO A DEBATE

1965
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:07,335
ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

1966
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:08,102
I THINK THEY WILL FOCUS ON THAT

1967
01:25:08,102 --> 01:25:10,872
MORE.

1968
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,408
I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO MAKE A

1969
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:14,275
DETERMINATION ABOUT THESE TWO

1970
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:15,977
PEOPLE AND WHICH ONE THEY CAN

1971
01:25:15,977 --> 01:25:17,245
COUNT ON TO MAKE A REAL

1972
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:18,079
DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES GOING

1973
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:18,446
FORWARD.

1974
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:22,083
JOHN: THIS IS YOUR GIG, RIGHT?

1975
01:25:22,083 --> 01:25:23,651
YOU HAVE MADE YOUR WHOLE CAREER

1976
01:25:23,651 --> 01:25:25,086
STUDYING WHAT VOTERS THINK ABOUT

1977
01:25:25,086 --> 01:25:29,023
ISSUES.

1978
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:31,959
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT, AMONG

1979
01:25:31,959 --> 01:25:33,761
AVAILABLE VOTERS OUT THERE, THE

1980
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,597
VOTES THAT ARE UP FOR GRABS,

1981
01:25:36,597 --> 01:25:37,432
THAT THIS ISSUE DOES NOT MATTER?

1982
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:39,100
>> I THINK PEOPLE HAVE FACTORED

1983
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:41,002
IN.

1984
01:25:41,002 --> 01:25:43,271
-- FACTORED IT IN.

1985
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:45,039
THEY HAVE FACTORED INTO THE

1986
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:47,208
TOTALITY AND THEY ARE MAKING

1987
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:50,645
THEIR JUDGMENTS BASED UPON IT.

1988
01:25:50,645 --> 01:25:51,479
TENS OF MILLIONS OF VIEWERS TUNE

1989
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:52,280
IN AND WATCH THE CONVENTIONS.

1990
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:57,218
PEOPLE HAVE FOUR DAYS, THEY BOTH

1991
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:58,019
HAD FOUR DAYS TO LAY OUT THEIR

1992
01:25:58,019 --> 01:25:58,720
MESSAGE AND ARGUMENT TO THE

1993
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,220
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

1994
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,022
THEY HEARD EVERYTHING.

1995
01:26:01,022 --> 01:26:05,460
THEY HAVE FACTORED THESE THINGS

1996
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:06,160
IN AND THEY ARE MAKING A

1997
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:08,530
DECISION RIGHT NOW, A PERSON

1998
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:09,364
THEY CAN COUNT ON TO TAKE THIS

1999
01:26:09,364 --> 01:26:10,164
COUNTRY WHERE THEY WANTED TO GO.

2000
01:26:10,164 --> 01:26:14,369
ALEX: LET ME ASK YOU THE SAME

2001
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:16,137
QUESTION IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

2002
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:18,406
IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT HILLARY

2003
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:19,240
CLINTON HAS REACHED THE CEILING

2004
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:19,807
ON HER UNFAVORABLE?

2005
01:26:19,807 --> 01:26:21,175
>> I THINK YOU JUST ASKED THE

2006
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:22,076
SAME QUESTION.

2007
01:26:22,076 --> 01:26:25,413
IF YOU LOOK AT THE TREND IN

2008
01:26:25,413 --> 01:26:26,280
POLLING, WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING

2009
01:26:26,280 --> 01:26:29,083
IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON'S

2010
01:26:29,083 --> 01:26:34,055
NUMBERS AREN'T GETTING BETTER,

2011
01:26:34,055 --> 01:26:34,889
DONALD TRUMPS ARE GETTING WORSE.

2012
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,191
ALEX: SO MAYBE YES?

2013
01:26:36,191 --> 01:26:39,561
>> I THINK IF YOU COMMUNICATE A

2014
01:26:39,561 --> 01:26:41,863
POSITIVE, OPTIMISTIC MESSAGE

2015
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:42,663
ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO TAKE

2016
01:26:42,663 --> 01:26:47,302
THIS COUNTRY, HOW YOU WILL DO

2017
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:48,102
IT, TELL THEM HOW IT IMPACTS

2018
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:48,870
THEIR LIVES, I THINK YOU WILL

2019
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:49,504
IMPROVE YOUR FAVORABLES.

2020
01:26:49,504 --> 01:26:50,271
I THINK THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE

2021
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:50,605
DOING.

2022
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:53,474
I THINK DONALD TRUMP, ON THE

2023
01:26:53,474 --> 01:26:54,809
OTHER HAND -- HE CAME OUT OF HIS

2024
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:55,576
CONVENTION, NUMBERS GETTING

2025
01:26:55,576 --> 01:26:55,977
WORSE.

2026
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,780
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

2027
01:26:58,780 --> 01:26:59,614
HE IS AS KNOWN TO THE AMERICAN

2028
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:01,916
PEOPLE IS HILLARY CLINTON.

2029
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:02,717
THEY ARE SEEING BOTH OF THESE

2030
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,052
PEOPLE EVERY DAY.

2031
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:04,852
HE IS SAYING THINGS THAT MAKE

2032
01:27:04,852 --> 01:27:07,255
HIS NUMBERS WORSE.

2033
01:27:07,255 --> 01:27:08,489
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT TOTALLY.

2034
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,392
I CAN EXPLAIN IT TO SOME DEGREE,

2035
01:27:11,392 --> 01:27:12,160
AND I THINK IT HAS TO DO WITH

2036
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:12,894
HATEFUL RHETORIC, THE TONE OF

2037
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:13,428
HIS CAMPAIGN.

I CAN'T TELL YOU.

2039
01:27:20,868 --> 01:27:21,569
I THINK HER NUMBERS ARE

2040
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:22,603
IMPROVING BECAUSE SHE IS TELLING

2041
01:27:22,603 --> 01:27:23,438
PEOPLE HOW SHE WILL GET IT DONE.

2042
01:27:23,438 --> 01:27:26,541
JOHN: JOEL BENENSON, APPARENTLY

2043
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,675
I AM NOT A CLIENT OF YOURS.

2044

JENNA, LET ME ASK YOU FIRST.

2055
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,147
HILLARY CLINTON GAVE A VERY

2056
01:30:19,147 --> 01:30:21,882
TOUGH SPEECH TODAY ABOUT DONALD

2064
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:41,969
AN ATTACK LIKE THIS.

2065
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:43,704
IN HER SPEECH SHE LAID OUT

2066
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:45,173
EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE THAT COULD

2067
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:47,208
IN ATTACK ADS.

2068
01:30:47,208 --> 01:30:50,244
SHE LAID IT ALL OUT.

2069
01:30:50,244 --> 01:30:53,047
SHE GAVE A SPEECH RIGHT BEFORE

2070
01:30:53,047 --> 01:30:54,682

2071
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:58,085
TRIED TO BEAT HER TO SOME OF

2072
01:30:58,085 --> 01:30:59,153
THESE THINGS.

2073
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:01,389
HE WALKS THROUGH A LOT OF HIS

2074
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:02,189
CONTROVERSIAL POSITIONS, CALLING

2075
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:07,428

2076
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:09,997
FROM MIDDLE EASTERN COUNTRIES OR

2077
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:10,731
COUNTRIES WITH TERRORISM.

2078
01:31:10,731 --> 01:31:13,434
HIS CALL FOR A WALL.

2079
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:14,135
