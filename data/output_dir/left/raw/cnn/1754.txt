1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,510
it was all it was ringing off the top of
the stage you could hear it hitting

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:08,340
trailers people scattering and there was
I mean it was chaos it was I've never

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,150
don't ever want to ever be a part of
anything like that ever again yeah of

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,059
course
and so what happened were you playing on

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,020
stage with Jason and how long did it
take to figure out what was unfolding I

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:26,760
was standing there you know I played I
just come offstage before Jason set and

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,359
I was back out there like we always do
we're all friends not here and we all I

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,219
was out there watching the show and
wanted to support him all of a sudden

9
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,270
you just heard a couple individual with
sounded you kind of lawyer you would ask

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,320
yourself that sounded kinda like a
gunshot yeah and then next thing you

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,120
know it was just unloading I'm like no
doubt an automatic sounding rifle or

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,260
some sort of machine gun or something
and at that point is when you could tell

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,030
the chaos and the fear and everyone's
eyes and their demeanor was changed and

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,230
everyone just started scrambling for
some of any sort of cover but in the way

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,459
it's set up in the way that you where
the guy was in Mandalay I mean it's like

16
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,760
shooting fish in a barrel
where he was I hate to say that he's

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,110
that sort of term but I mean it was I
feel so bad for these people and we're

18
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,439
all lucky we were just talking about
this my crew everyone else's crew

19
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,479
backstage we're so lucky that none of us
were in the line of fire because there's

20
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,630
so many innocent people that were there
to have a great time that's what we're

21
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,310
here to do for them they've lost their
lives this is not an exaggeration this

22
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,829
shooting was going on for at least 10
minutes I mean it was non-stop and by

23
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,780
the time I got back to the bus after
hopping a few fences we were we were all

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,950
laying down in the middle of the bus and
it was kickin fire was continuing

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:00:00,000
outside so this is something that was an
all ongoing situation
