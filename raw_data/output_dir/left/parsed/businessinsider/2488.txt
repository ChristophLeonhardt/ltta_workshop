- Even after being nailed by the car,
I'm not gonna stop.
If I get hurt enough,
maybe that'll deter me
from being so enthusiastic about it,
but until that day comes,
it's still the coolest thing
I could possibly think of
going and doing on a Sunday.
It's fun, and it's fun
to be a part of the race
'cause if we screw it up,
we screw up where the
car finishes essentially.
So it makes it that much more fun
'cause you're actually part of it.
It's not just the driver at that point.
The crew has a say-so in what's going on.
What does it take to be that guy?
Bottom line, it takes
dedication, concentration,
obviously the will to
put yourself in that kind
of harm's environment
and being able to handle, let's call it,
high-pressure environments.
That's a good way to describe that.
I wear a heart monitor,
and you're totally calm
and cool as a cucumber
and then when you know
you're 10 seconds out,
your heart rate increases.
It's crazy.
And you get done and you're pretty high
for, you know, 40 seconds,
then you come back down to reality,
like okay, that was it.
Now we wait around for the next one, ha.
Everybody's kind of at risk, for sure.
The fueler especially is at risk
'cause he's got a big
giant fuel hose in his hand
that's pumping a lot of gallons per second
and if that malfunctions and breaks,
he's gonna be doused in
a very flammable liquid
and has the potential to go up in flames.
It's happened before.
Inside front, me, I'm in a prime position
to be hit by the car, for sure
because I've got a wall behind me
and nowhere to go, essentially.
So if the driver screws
up coming into the box,
normally, I can get pummeled pretty well.
No one's safe.
It was our first stop of the race.
Kyle was a rookie this year.
He just made a small mistake and locked up
and basically, once the car
was 10, 12 feet away from me,
like, I knew it was coming.
And in the video, you can see me
kind of hesitate a little
bit, but car made contact.
I instantly stood up, I didn't
feel anything was wrong,
and we finished the pit
stop and that was it.
Once I got over the wall,
then reality kind of set in,
like, wow, you know, I
just got hit by the car.
Medical came over and
made sure I was okay.
Then team management made
sure I was all right.
Indy Car made sure I was okay.
I felt fine, I stayed in it.
I didn't wanna stop, it's the Indy 500.
I think you just have to,
you have to keep it in
the back of your head.
You know, I know there's people out there
that have done this for years
that have never been hurt
and that's a good thing.
And then I've worked with people
who have been severely
hurt to the point where
three years later,
they're still doing rehab
and reconstructive surgeries
and pins and screws
and they're not going
over the wall anymore,
they don't want to.
If we do three pit stops in a race,
and the race is two and
a half hours long, that
that 30 seconds of work that
we did throughout the race
is worth every ounce of
stress and frustration
and being tired and long
hours and this and that.
That 30 seconds is
totally worth everything.
