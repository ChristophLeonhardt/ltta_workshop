OFFICE FOLLOWING A DISTURBING
APPEARANCE ON SACHA COHEN'S
VIDEO.
>> BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE, YOU
COULD BE THE VICTIM OF
KIDNAPPING BY ISIS.
IN AMERICA THERE IS ONE
FORBIDDEN WORD.
ATTACK.
GO.
   
>> THE N WORD IS LOONEY.
IF YOUR BUTTOCKS TOUCH THEM IT
>> IF YOU WANT TO WIN, YOU SHOW
SOME SKIN.
U.S.A., U.S.A.
 YOU SHOW ME YOUR WEAPON,
GO.
JESSE: DIAMOND AND SILK.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER B.S.
METER THAN THAT.
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S SO NAIVE
TO FALL FOR THAT.
THERE HAS TO BE A CODE OF
CONDUCT WHERE YOU DON'T DROP IT
WITH IT'S HOT MORE DO YOU DO
DEROGATORY ACTIONS.
IF HE STEPPED DOWN, OTHER PEOPLE
SHOULD STEP DOWN LIKE THE ONE
RUNNING AROUND SAYING WE HAVE TO
IMPEACH 45.
JESSE: I HAD A BUDDY OUT IN
BRUNCH AT THE FOUR SEASONS.
AND SHE ADMITTED TO HIM THAT
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE OF THE GOOD
ECONOMY WOULD GET RE-ELECTED IN
SHE KNOWS IT.
JESSE: WE HAVE ELIZABETH WARREN
AS THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO CALL
HER, POCAHONTAS.
SHE SAYS THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING
TO TURN RACES AGAINST EACH
REAL PROBLEM AMERICA.
IT'S THE FAULT OF THOSE PEOPLE.
PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK LIKE.
PEOPLE WHO DON'T SOUNDS LIKE
WHO AREN'T THE SAME COLOR AND
DON'T SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE.
FILL IN THE BLANKS.
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO IS PUT BLACK
WORKING PEOPLE AGAINST WHITE
WORKING PEOPLE.
JESSE: I DON'T SEE THAT.
BUT I DO SEE THIS.
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION HAS A
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON WAGES AND
WHITE, AND LEGAL HISPANICS.
INCITE A RACE WAR.
>> THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS
TALKING ABOUT.
BUT SAYING POCAHONTAS DON'T EVEN
REALIZES WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS
DOING IS BRINGING OUR COUNTRY
TOGETHER, FOLLOWING THE LAW.
SOMETHING THEY ARE NOT USED TO
A DEMOCRAT.
SHE DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE.
THEY ARE A MESS OVER THERE, SO
THEY WILL RACE BAIT TO GET A
VOTE.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO.
WE KNOW WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS
DOING AND WE ARE HAPPY HE'S
MAKING THIS PLACE GREATER THAN
WE HAVE EVER SEEN IT BEFORE.
THE DOG WHISTLERS.
THEY TRY TO INSTILL FEAR IN
PEOPLE WITH IT MANY THEM DOING
ALL THE RACE BAITING AND BEING
WITH DIVISIVE.
JESSE: I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE
EVEN BUYING IT ANYMORE.
THERE IS A WOMAN NAMED JEANNETTE
GARCIA.
SHE IS A WEATHER GIRL.
AND ONE OF THE MOST OF FAMOUS IN
THE ENTIRE WORLD.
EVERYBODY WANTS TO DATE HER.
SHE IS AN ELIGIBLE BACHELORETTE.
SHE GETS TOGETHER WITH THIS GUY,
DOUGLAS MARTIN.
HE'S A PROFESSIONAL GAMER.
THEY ARE DATING FOR A WHILE AND
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT, AND THIS
GUY DOUGLAS DUMPS THIS WOMAN
HERE BECAUSE HE WANTS TO
DEDICATE MORE TIME TO PLAYING
VIDEO GAMES FULL TIME.
CAN YOU GUYS BELIEVE IT?
>> ANY TIME A MAN WANT TO PLAY A
YOU.
THAT REJECTION WAS PROBABLY FOR
HER PROTECTION.
BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS SHOWING
YOUR GOODIES TO EVERYBODY.
KEEP YOUR GOODIES TO YOURSELF.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LET THE WORLD
SEE EVERYTHING AS A WOMAN.
JESSE: HE LIKES "CALL OF DUTY,"
THE VIDEO GAME.
