hey everyone hope all is well I am

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry I've not made a new video</font>

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,140
in a couple of months I've had so much

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,570
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in just over a week's time</font>

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,670
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be my seven-year YouTube</font>

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,830
anniversary and I don't know about you

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of feels like a good</font>

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,810
starting point for you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting this</font>

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,640
channel up and running again with lots

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,859
and lots of content and so on this video

11
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I just want to tell you what's been</font>

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,769
going on and what I plan for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future</font>

13
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,399
now for those of you that watch lots of

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,079
video bloggers on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube you may have</font>

15
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">come across some videos over the past</font>

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,790
year from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the likes of charlie mcdonnell</font>

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,910
chris kendall crabstickz where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,940
about anxiety of making regular videos

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,190
and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very common</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and it's</font>

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,120
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've gone through the past</font>

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,489
seven years and there's two main reasons

22
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">for it the first is to do with my</font>

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,600
external environment and that's because

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,689
i work a full-time job it takes up my

25
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,760
entire week and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weekend i</font>

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,670
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to shut off chill except I've</font>

27
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,159
got housework and I've got to do bills

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,729
and paperwork and then I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:19,439
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the gym and getting my fitness</font>

30
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,810
back up and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got my band which I</font>

31
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,500
love and various projects and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,549
job is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> a YouTube network and</font>

33
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,549
helping others you know build up their

34
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,850
channels and audiences it leaves me

35
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:39,000
feeling pretty tired at the thought of

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,600
then dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my own channel so</font>

37
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,340
that's a big part of it and what it

38
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,549
means is if I miss a week out of making

39
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:50,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos I'll go can't believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've missed</font>

40
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,840
a week I've got to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure next week's</font>

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,780
video is even better to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make up for that</font>

42
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,600
lost time but when I make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> video I'm</font>

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,340
not entirely happy with it with this new

44
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,369
heightened expectation I feel I have to

45
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,060
fulfill and then it may get<font color="#E5E5E5"> delayed for</font>

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,848
another week and for every week that

47
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,540
passes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bigger the anxiety that</font>

48
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,750
builds<font color="#E5E5E5"> up within me</font>

49
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,980
of worrying that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to disappoint</font>

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,540
and that's something I've just got to

51
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,850
let go<font color="#E5E5E5"> of and the second part of you</font>

52
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,820
know why I've had this issue is actually

53
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,370
now solved and going to help me with

54
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,910
making regular content and and that is

55
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,740
my youtube<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel I've never been happy</font>

56
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,670
with how it is as a physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity</font>

57
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,430
firstly blade 376 was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> user name um I</font>

58
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,940
chose when I was a kid and used it for

59
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,100
computer game high schools<font color="#E5E5E5"> I joined</font>

60
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube never thinking it was going to</font>

61
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,739
go anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and blade 376 became a brand</font>

62
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,739
I wasn't entirely happy with um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

63
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,800
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really got to me when one of my old</font>

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,830
band was playing in Wales at this show

65
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,630
and a guy came in went<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the merch</font>

66
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:06,760
stand and said hey guys what's it like

67
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,500
being in a band<font color="#CCCCCC"> with blade and they were</font>

68
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,400
like blade yeah yeah yeahs blade know my

69
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
name is miles and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've never been able</font>

70
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,660
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away from it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it would</font>

71
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">always say it under my videos but</font>

72
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,720
luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube functionality has</font>

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,220
improved and it's given me a better

74
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,560
platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can now link it with a</font>

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,630
Google+ account so it now says miles

76
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:29,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">dire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually all the playlists and</font>

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,410
the way the channel is organized can

78
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,930
help me with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest problem I've</font>

79
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,930
had with my channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is my brand</font>

80
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,060
because we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a brand regardless</font>

81
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,489
of why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're making videos but as a</font>

82
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube marketing myself I say you need</font>

83
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,620
one clear vision so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

84
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,200
they're subscribing to epic meal time

85
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,750
for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know every week you're</font>

86
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,400
gonna get a new crazy bit of foodage

87
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,049
being created if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to word it</font>

88
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,049
that way with their own theme or aspect

89
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:05,079
of topicality with me people<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe</font>

90
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,910
because they see me put a horse mask on

91
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:10,630
and be silly but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then my next video is</font>

92
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,950
about calling out corruption in

93
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,350
government oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure i subscribe</font>

94
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,940
for that they may feel which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

95
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,978
completely legitimate so how do I

96
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,810
communicate myself better because my

97
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,089
channel has never been about sticking to

98
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,530
a particular thing is about

99
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,520
self-discovery and just being myself

100
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,490
inspiring other people to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font>

101
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,289
to benefit their own goals and ambitions

102
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:35,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">I see myself as an enabler</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so with</font>

103
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:40,000
the new functionality I and the way it's

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,860
laid out you've always had playlist but

105
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,300
now they're like called sections or

106
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,840
shelves my channel branding is<font color="#CCCCCC"> miles</font>

107
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">dire entertain inform inspire and I feel</font>

108
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:52,479
those are three great categories for

109
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,690
putting my content in and I've spent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

110
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,419
last three weeks address off' think how

111
00:04:58,419 --> 00:05:00,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">many hours I've spent it's been a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

112
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,630
late nights<font color="#E5E5E5"> and four weekends doing it</font>

113
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">270 plus videos redoing the thumbnails</font>

114
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,620
descriptions tags and putting them into

115
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,159
one of those playlists but it has been

116
00:05:15,159 --> 00:05:17,050
worth it and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at my channel</font>

117
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,210
now you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's either</font>

118
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,490
entertain comedy and all that inform how

119
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,449
to's tutorials or world events and

120
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:31,449
inspire how to feel good about yourself

121
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,270
or how to deal with particular

122
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,120
situations sort of life lessons but

123
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,180
there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two other playlists as well</font>

124
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,610
live<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates like this one which doesn't</font>

125
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,650
really fit into any particular one

126
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular category and media</font>

127
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,300
appearances<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoever on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> television stuff</font>

128
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,449
like that so now those foundations have

129
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:54,759
been put in place I'm really really

130
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:57,039
ready to give this another go and over

131
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,620
the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years I had a wall of</font>

132
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,529
post-it notes and on my phone a huge

133
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,639
list of video titles of ideas I had got

134
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,090
100 to 200 about 30 ideas that been

135
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,949
fully fleshed out but because of this

136
00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:13,599
anxiety I'm like I don't know what my

137
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:15,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">next video should be and I haven't done</font>

138
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,830
them in the end and I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font>

139
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,199
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make content and there's two</font>

140
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,940
aspects of content creation I've had an

141
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,270
issue with on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand it's been</font>

142
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,699
about what have what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys know</font>

143
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,229
about what I'm talking about so

144
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:31,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes I explain things in way too</font>

145
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,400
much detail so the videos go<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long</font>

146
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,279
I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that right now but at</font>

147
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:38,380
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time I may talk about a</font>

148
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,139
particular issue and assume well

149
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,449
a third of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people watching probably</font>

150
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:44,889
know what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about so I don't need</font>

151
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain what it is well know if</font>

152
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,969
two-thirds don't know then I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

153
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:51,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain it so I'm probably going to do a</font>

154
00:06:51,099 --> 00:06:54,099
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more short videos like explaining</font>

155
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,259
the definitions of particular things and

156
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:58,509
the other part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my content creation</font>

157
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,460
dilemma is that I don't give myself

158
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,919
enough credit I over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the years I've</font>

159
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
become less and less about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my life and</font>

160
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,789
me as a personality and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

161
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,469

I've been getting and I realize I need

166
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,830
to have more faith in myself and just

167
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,750
let go and not worry just about the

168
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,909
ideas but to do life updates do talk

169
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:29,830
