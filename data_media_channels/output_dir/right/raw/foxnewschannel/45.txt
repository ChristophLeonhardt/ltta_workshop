1
00:00:02,376 --> 00:00:03,676
OF FINE-TUNING OUR BORDER

2
00:00:03,677 --> 00:00:04,010
PATROL.

3
00:00:04,011 --> 00:00:05,378
SPEED LENT BOTH OF YOU,

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,880
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

5
00:00:06,881 --> 00:00:08,982
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM THAT

6
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,583
WILL CONTINUE UNTIL WE DEVELOP

7
00:00:10,584 --> 00:00:13,786
SOLUTIONS AND JAMES JUST

8
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:15,421
REFERRED TO CONGRESSIONAL

9
00:00:15,422 --> 00:00:15,989
SOLUTIONS NECESSARY.

10
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,857
FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR TOM HOMAN

11
00:00:17,858 --> 00:00:20,393
AND LOUISIANA RICK CONGRESSMAN

12
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:21,995
AND HOUSE WITH STEVE SCALISE.

13
00:00:21,996 --> 00:00:23,863
TOM, LET'S START WITH YOU WITH

14
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:25,365
ALL YOUR EXPERTISE IN THIS

15
00:00:25,366 --> 00:00:25,698
MATTER.

16
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,599
WHAT'S THE ONE THING THAT COULD

17
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,668
BE DONE RIGHT NOW TO HELP STEM

18
00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:29,202
THIS TIDE OF?

19
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,472
>> THERE IS ACTUALLY TWO THINGS.

20
00:00:32,473 --> 00:00:34,174
FIRST OF ALL, IT READS THE

21
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:34,641
ASYLUM BALL.

22
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:37,410
AS THE ATTORNEY SAID, 88% OF

23
00:00:37,411 --> 00:00:38,645
THEM PASSED THE ASYLUM INTERVIEW

24
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:39,812
BECAUSE THEY ARE COACHED ON WHAT

25
00:00:39,813 --> 00:00:40,980
TO SAY.

26
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:47,153
BUT WHEN THEY GET TO COURT, THEN

27
00:00:47,154 --> 00:00:48,321
THEY LOSE A CASE.

28
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:52,792
THE SECOND THING WE DO, THEY

29
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:54,260
HAVE A RIGHT TO CLAIM ASYLUM AND

30
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,196
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY YOU CAN

31
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:57,997
GARRETT A GUARANTEE DUE PROCESS.

32
00:00:57,998 --> 00:00:59,265
KEEP THEM IN THE RESIDENTIAL

33
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,201
CENTER UNTIL THEY SEE THE JUDGE.

34
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:03,603
BACK IN 2014, WE KEPT THEM THERE

35
00:01:03,604 --> 00:01:14,781
TO SEE THE JUDGE AND GUESS WHAT?

36
00:01:14,782 --> 00:01:19,953
80%, >> CONGRESSMAN SCALISE, WE

37
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:25,258
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BEFORE THIS

38
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,393
ELECTION.

39
00:01:27,394 --> 00:01:28,094
IT COST TAXPAYERS BILLIONS OF

40
00:01:28,095 --> 00:01:29,963
DOLLARS TO TAKE MILLIONS OF

41
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,864
PEOPLE IN.

42
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:34,200
PUBLIC SCHOOL, HEALTH CARE, AND

43
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,201
IT'S A HEALTH CARE ISSUE TWO

44
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:36,536
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT

45
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:39,172
PEOPLE HAVE COMING IN HERE.

46
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:40,707
WE HAVE DISEASES IN THIS COUNTRY

47
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:43,309
WE HAVEN'T HAD FOR DECADES.

48
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,345
WHAT WILL CONGRESS DO AFTER THE

49
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:47,680
MIDTERMS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE?

50
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:48,381
>> IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS YOU

51
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:51,484
WILL SEE THIS DEBATE PLAY OUT

52
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,418
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THAT ELECTION

53
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,921
IN TWO WEEKS WILL HELP DECIDE I

54
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,589
IT.

55
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,624
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT

56
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,726
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PUTTING SUCH

57
00:01:59,727 --> 00:02:02,462
A SHARP FOCUS ON THAT.

58
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:06,833
IT'S LIKE UP PARADE OF

59
00:02:06,834 --> 00:02:08,601
ASYLUM-SEEKERS.

60
00:02:08,602 --> 00:02:09,302
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COACHING

61
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:10,803
THEM ALONG THE WAY SO THAT AT

62
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:12,472
THE BEGINNING OF THIS MARCH,

63
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:13,172
THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT COMING

64
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,408
OVER HERE AND LOOKING FOR JOBS

65
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:17,610
AND BY THE TIME THEY GET CLOSER,

66
00:02:17,611 --> 00:02:19,379
THEY ARE BEING COACHED ABOUT HOW

67
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,880
TO FINALLY TRY TO GET IN HERE

68
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:22,682
LEGALLY EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT

69
00:02:22,683 --> 00:02:23,316
WHAT THE LEGAL PROCESS IS

70
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,385
SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE.

71
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:27,787
WE NEED TO CHANGE THE LAW, WE'VE

72
00:02:27,788 --> 00:02:29,789
HAD TWO DIFFERENT BILLS ON THE

73
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,223
HOUSE FLOOR.

74
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:35,261
WITHOUT ACTUALLY               E

WITHOUT ACTUALLY               O

89
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,398
TIGHTEN THESE LOOPHOLES UP.

90
00:02:38,399 --> 00:02:40,199
>> Laura: I WOULD PULL

91
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,402
EVERYONE BACK FROM THE TERM

92
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:44,370
CAMPAIGNING.

93
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,805
WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, , A

94
00:02:45,806 --> 00:02:46,773
WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE, , D

95
00:02:46,774 --> 00:02:48,374
MAYBE MOST OF THEM ARE UNARMED,

96
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,777
OR ALL OF THEM FOR ALL WE KNOW.

97
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:53,012
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE PRICING THIS

98
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:55,381
PLAY OUT, BUT THIS IS LIKE THE

99
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:57,517
PHONE IS RINGING AND NO ONE IS

100
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:58,217
HOME.

101
00:02:58,218 --> 00:02:59,218
>> ERASING PRESIDENT TRUMP

102
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:01,054
SAYING, WE ARE NOT GOING TO

103
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:01,788
ALLOW THIS.

104
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,423
FIRST OF ALL COME ALL THE OLD

105
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:04,791
LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, ALL

106
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:06,025
THOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

107
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:07,393
FOREIGN AID NEED TO BE ON THE

108
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:07,827
TABLE.

109
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:09,962
THIS IS GOING TO BE A THREAT TO

110
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,064
YOUR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

111
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:11,798
YOU ARE GETTING.

112
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,032
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALREADY

113
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,233
MADE THAT CLEAR.

114
00:03:14,234 --> 00:03:18,004
THIS WILL BE IN JEOPARDY.

115
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:18,671
YOU SAW SECRETARY OF STATE

116
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:19,806
POMPEO SAYING, WE ARE NOT GOING

117
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,641
TO LET YOU INTO OUR COUNTRY.

118
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,676
WE HAVE TO TREAT THIS AS A   A A

119
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:23,910
WE HAVE TO TREAT THIS AS A   A D

120
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:28,748
INVASION BUT ALSO AS A NATION OF

121
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:29,549
LAWS.

122
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,616
JUST PLAY BY THE RULES.

123
00:03:30,617 --> 00:03:31,884
THERE ARE RULES THAT YOU CAN

124
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:34,020
PLAY BY BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO

125
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:34,721
GAIN THE SYSTEM.

126
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:37,223
WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT

127
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:38,558
THESE LAWS HAVE TO BE CHANGED,

128
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,394
AND THERE WILL BE AN ELECTION IN

129
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:42,528
JUST TWO WEEKS.

130
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:46,232
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT --

131
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:49,001
PELOSI WANTS OPEN BORDERS.

132
00:03:49,002 --> 00:03:50,203
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS DONE A GREAT

133
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:51,571
JOB OF MAKING THIS AN ELECTION

134
00:03:51,572 --> 00:03:52,638
ISSUE BECAUSE A COUNTRY WILL

135
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,008
ULTIMATELY DECIDE.

136
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,948
NATIONAL SECURITY OPEN BORDERS,

137
00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:05,785
I'M FOR IT, NATIONAL SECURITY.

138
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:08,988
>> THE GROUPS THAT ARE

139
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,124
FACILITATING THIS, THEY ARE

140
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,592
COCONSPIRATORS.

141
00:04:12,593 --> 00:04:13,993
>> WHAT THEY DESCRIBE IS

142
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:14,727
ABSOLUTELY AIDING AND ABETTING

143
00:04:14,728 --> 00:04:17,397
AND HELPING PEOPLE.

144
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:18,965
THAT'S A VIOLATION OF

145
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,000
UNITED STATES CODE 1324 WHICH IS

146
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,603
A FELONY.

147
00:04:23,604 --> 00:00:00,000
SO THEY NEED TO WORK WITH THE
