PLACE THIS WEEKEND?

26
00:00:48,178 --> 00:00:48,911
>> I WILL TELL YOU, IT REALLY

27
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:51,680
SHOWS THE DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT

28
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,514
YOU HAVE IN WASHINGTON D.C. AND

29
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:53,315
NEW YORK CITY AND THE BELTWAY

30
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:56,652
AND THE BIG CITIES IN AMERICA

31
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:57,553
WHO HAVE BEEN BUYING INTO THIS

32
00:00:57,554 --> 00:01:00,255
MOB LIKE MENTALITY OF OPPOSING

33
00:01:00,256 --> 00:01:02,925
A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NOMINEE

34
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:08,063
FOR APPARENTLY NO REASON.

35
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:08,797
IN CONTRAST, MARIA, I'VE BEEN

36
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:09,498
OUT HERE IN THE RURAL PART OF

37
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:10,365
CALIFORNIA MY DISTRICT FOR THE

38
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:11,266
LAST WEEK.

39
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:13,368
I CANNOT GO ANYWHERE, TO ANY

40
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,503
COFFEESHOP, GROCERY STORE,

41
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:15,604
ANYWHERE, WITHOUT SOMEONE

42
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:18,040
BRINGING UP JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND

43
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:21,043
HOW UPSET THEY ARE.

44
00:01:21,044 --> 00:01:22,478
NOT ONLY BY WHAT THEY ARE DOING

45
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,212
TO HIM IN THE FAMILY BUT BY THE

46
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:26,281
BEHAVIOR OF POLITICIANS.

47
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:27,649
IT LOOKS LIKE TOTAL CHAOS IN

48
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,854
WASHINGTON D.C. WHEN REALLY,

49
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:32,621
THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

50
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:33,355
WE HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD IN

51
00:01:33,356 --> 00:01:37,159
THIS COUNTRY.

52
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,661
MARIA: WE LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES

53
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:40,429
OF THE PRESIDENTS HAVE HAD,

54
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,163
THEY'VE BEEN VERY POSITIVE FROM

55
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:45,167
ECONOMIC TO OBVIOUSLY, THE

56
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:48,637
JUDGE NAMING IS, JUDICIAL AS

57
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:49,271
WELL AS THE SUPREME COURT.

58
00:01:49,272 --> 00:01:50,839
IT IS INTERESTING TO SAY THE

59
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,144
HATE COMING FROM THE LEFT.

60
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:56,011
SUSAN COLLINS, VOTED OBVIOUS

61
00:01:56,012 --> 00:01:56,779
BECOME A VERY IMPORTANT TO GET

62
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,046
HER VOTE TO CONFIRM KAVANAUGH.

63
00:01:58,047 --> 00:01:59,014
SHE HAS BEEN FLOODED WITH

64
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:00,616
ABUSIVE TWEETS.

65
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:01,316
THREATENING DEATHS, VIOLENCE,

66
00:02:01,317 --> 00:02:05,053
FOR SUSAN COLLINS, WE SEE THE

67
00:02:05,054 --> 00:02:06,288
PROTESTERS CONTINUING.

68
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:07,122
WHERE DO THINGS GO FROM HERE,

69
00:02:07,123 --> 00:02:07,523
CONGRESSMAN?

70
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:08,190
GIVEN THE LEVEL OF HATE AND

71
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:08,824
UPSET ON THE LEFT AND THE

72
00:02:08,824 --> 00:02:12,961
SHAMING TACTICS?

73
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:18,100
>> I THINK THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE

74
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,801
BEEN SAYING FOR THE LAST TWO

75
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:19,101
YEARS.

76
00:02:19,102 --> 00:02:20,169
IT IS BEEN DONE TO THE

77
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,136
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES.

78
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:22,404
A BUNCH OF BILLIONAIRES WORKING

79
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,373
WITH THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA AND

80
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:25,140
DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO BRING UP A

81
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,074
HOAX, FAKE NEWS STORY, THEY

82
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:27,709
RILE UP THE BASE AND I HAVE A

83
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,644
BUNCH OF AMERICANS OUT THERE

84
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:29,344
WHO BELIEVE THINGS THAT JUST

85
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:32,714
ARE NOT TRUE.

86
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:34,449
YOU COUPLE THAT WITH WHAT YOU

87
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,152
HAVE SEEN WITH ALL THESE CRAZY

88
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:41,056
PROTESTS AND WHEN YOU ASK, WHAT

89
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:42,424
ARE YOU PROTESTING ABOUT?

90
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:43,025
THEY CANNOT ANSWER THE

91
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:43,392
QUESTION.

92
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:43,692
RIGHT?

93
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:44,860
YOU COVER THIS EVERY DAY ON

94
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:45,227
YOUR SHOW.

95
00:02:45,228 --> 00:02:46,929
THE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL, THE

96
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,964
MILITARY IS BEING REBUILT,

97
00:02:48,965 --> 00:02:52,734
TRADE AGREEMENT GETTING DONE.

98
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:53,535
WHAT DO YOU SEE, WHAT OTHER

99
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:53,936
PROTESTING?

100
00:02:53,937 --> 00:02:56,205
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS.

101
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:56,972
THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE LIKE,

102
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:58,807
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON

103
00:02:58,808 --> 00:02:59,308
THERE?

104
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:02,244
THAT IS WHY I SAY, WHAT YOU SAW

105
00:03:02,245 --> 00:03:04,079
HAPPEN, REALLY, I WILL SUBMIT

106
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,147
DOWN TO THIS.

107
00:03:05,148 --> 00:03:07,149
YOU SO WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING,

108
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,986
TO THE PRESIDENT, WITH

109
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:13,155
PROTESTS, BLOCKING STREETS,

110
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:15,057
VIOLENCE.

111
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:16,024
YOU NOW SAW THAT DOWN TO NUMBER

112
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:18,560
ONE, A FEDERAL JUDGE.

113
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:19,161
AND NOW, UNITED STATES

114
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:19,528
SENATORS.

115
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:20,963
I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

116
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:24,199
HAVE WOKE UP TO THE FACT THAT

117
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,967
THIS IS NOT NORMAL BEHAVIOR FOR

118
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:28,003
PEOPLE TO BE DOING IN THIS

119
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:28,604
COUNTRY.

120
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:29,371
MARIA: THAT IS WHAT WE SAW LAST

121
00:03:29,372 --> 00:03:29,671
WEEK.

122
00:03:29,672 --> 00:03:30,439
A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WE WANT TO

123
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,739
SHOW.

124
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,807
BECAUSE A NEW STRATEGY OF

125
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:35,377
GETTING IN YOUR FACE WAS REALLY

126
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:36,245
RAMPED UP AS THE CONFIRMATION

127
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:36,945
PROCESS TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK.

128
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:40,215
WATCH THIS.

129
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:40,949
>> WHY ARE YOU PUTTING YOUR

130
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:49,658
HANDS ON HER?

131
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,161
>> DON'T YOU WAVE YOUR HAND AT

132
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:56,965
ME!

133
00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:07,476
[INAUDIBLE]

134
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:12,915
MARIA: NOT TO MENTION, THE

135
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:13,615
SO-CALLED -- WHERE AN INTERN

136
00:04:13,616 --> 00:04:15,117
FOR SHEILA JACKSON, A DEMOCRAT,

137
00:04:15,118 --> 00:04:17,519
SHEILA JACKSON AS WELL AS

138
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,155
BARBARA BOXER.

139
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:22,324
THE INTRO WAS ARRESTED BY

140
00:04:22,325 --> 00:04:25,160
PUTTING INFORMATION, ADDRESSES,

141
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:27,195
PHONE NUMBERS OF LINDSEY

142
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,163
GRAHAM, MIKE LEE AND ORRIN

143
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:31,667
HATCH ON THE INTERNET.

144
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:33,936
>> YEAH, THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE

145
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:34,369
SEEING, MARIA.

146
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:40,943
THIS IS WAS HAPPENING ALL OF

147
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:42,177
AMERICA.

148
00:04:42,178 --> 00:04:42,878
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF AT THE

149
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,478
BEGINNING OF THE RUSSIA

150
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,179
INVESTIGATION, IF MYSELF FOR

151
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,782
TREY GOWDY WOULD HAVE STARTED

152
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:49,151
ASKING QUESTIONS OF TOP DOJ

153
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:52,254
OFFICIALS, WE WOULD HAVE

154
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:53,021
BROUGHT OUT THE YEARBOOK AND

155
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,523
STARTED PAGING THROUGH THEIR

156
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:57,059
HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOKS.

157
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,893
AND STARTED ASKING THEM

158
00:04:57,894 --> 00:04:58,260
QUESTIONS.

159
00:04:58,261 --> 00:04:58,627
OKAY?

160
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,128
TWO YEARS AGO, YEAR AND AND A

161
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:01,096
HALF AGO, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN

162
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:01,630
LAUGHED AT, MOCKED.

163
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:05,600
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST

164
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:05,901
JOKE.

165
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:08,870
AND BY THE WAY IT IS THE

166
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:09,304
BIGGEST JOKE.

167
00:05:09,305 --> 00:05:10,572
MARIA: DO THINK THAT THIS IS

168
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:13,008
CHANGE THE DYNAMICS GOING INTO

169
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:17,145
THE MIDTERMS FOUR WEEKS AWAY?

170
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:18,180
>> I DO.

171
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:18,914
MOST AMERICANS KNOW IT IS

172
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:21,149
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS TO HAVE

173
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,484
UNITED STATES SENATORS ASKING A

174
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:25,120
FEDERAL JUDGE ABOUT HIS

175
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:29,091
YEARBOOK ENTRY.

176
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:29,591
IT IS RIDICULOUS!

177
00:05:29,592 --> 00:05:31,360
I HOPE THAT YOU HAD TENS OF

178
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,195
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PAYING

179
00:05:33,196 --> 00:05:36,098
ATTENTION TO THIS.

180
00:05:36,099 --> 00:00:00,000
I THINK FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW,
