BRET: IT WAS UNSCHEDULED AND

00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:11,438
UNSCRIPTED.

4
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:13,340
THE PRESS HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO

5
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,474
GET THESE SHOTS.

6
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,677
JUST AFTER 6:00 P.M. ON MAY 29,

7
00:00:17,677 --> 00:00:18,445
1988 PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN

8
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,614
AND FIRST LADY NANCY EMERGED

9
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:23,149
FROM THEIR LIMOUSINE IN THE

10
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:24,751
HISTORIC SECTION OF MOSCOW.

11
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:25,652
WORD THAT THE AMERICAN

12
00:00:25,652 --> 00:00:27,020
PRESIDENT HAD COME OUT TO MEET

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,022
THEM UNANNOUNCED INSTANTLY

14
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:30,423
SPREAD, AND THOUSANDS OF

15
00:00:30,423 --> 00:00:32,792
RUSSIANS SURGED ONTO THE

16
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:33,126
STREETS.

17
00:00:33,126 --> 00:00:34,628
DESPITE A GROWING WORRY, THINGS

18
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,162
COULD SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL,

19
00:00:36,162 --> 00:00:37,964
THE 77-YEAR-OLD REAGAN ACTUALLY

20
00:00:37,964 --> 00:00:40,800
CLIMBED ONTO A VEGETABLE CART

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,471
TO ADDRESS THE CROWD.

22
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:46,506
REAGAN'S PRESS SECRETARY MARLIN

23
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,707
FITZWATER THOUGHT THIS IS GOING

24
00:00:47,707 --> 00:00:50,911
TO BE A DISASTER OR BE THE

25
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:52,078
GREATEST PERFORMANCE IN

26
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:53,313
HISTORY.

27
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:53,613
HELLO.

28
00:00:53,613 --> 00:00:55,248
I'M BRET BAIER, WHAT THE SCENE

29
00:00:55,248 --> 00:00:57,150
TURNED OUT TO BE WAS THE

30
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,818
DRAMATIC OPENING ACT OF A CLASH

31
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:01,621
OF IMAGES, WORDS AND IDEAS THAT

32
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,856
SIGNALED TO THE WORLD THAT THE

33
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,456
COLD WAR WAS ALL BUT ONE.

34
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:06,860
I WRITE ABOUT IT IN MY NEW

35
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,161
BOOK, "THREE DAYS IN MOSCOW,"

36
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,095
RONALD REAGAN AND THE FALL OF

37
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:10,797
THE SOVIET EMPIRE.

38
00:01:10,797 --> 00:01:13,233
EPIC STORY WITH UNLIKELY HERO

39
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,135
OR SO IT ONCE SEEMED.

40
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:26,680
HARD TO BELIEVE BUT AS A YOUNG

41
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,082
MAN, THE GREATEST OF COLD

42
00:01:29,082 --> 00:01:31,518
WARRIORS WAS SO LEFT WING, THE

43
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:33,586
FBI SUSPECTED HE WAS A

44
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:34,888
COMMUNIST.

45
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:39,225
IN 1946, COMMUNISTS AND THE

46
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,227
SCREEN ACTORS GUILD THREATENED

47
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,963
TO END REAGAN'S ACTING CAREER

48
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:47,600
BY POURING ACID ON HIS FACE.

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,869
REAGAN BEGAN TO TAKE NOTICE OF

50
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:50,770
COMMUNIST EXPANSION OVERSEAS.

51
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,706
>> WE IN AMERICA HAVE MET SOME

52
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:56,309
YEARS AGO A SIMILAR PROGRAM

53
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:59,112
CALLED PRESSIONISM UNDER THE

54
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:03,950
KAISER WEEK MET IT MORE

55
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,486
RECENTLY UNDER NAZISM UNDER

56
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:07,120
HITLER AND THE NATIONAL

57
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,455
EXPANSION OF RUSSIA.

58
00:02:09,455 --> 00:02:11,091
BRET: FOR THE NEXT 40 YEARS HE

59
00:02:11,091 --> 00:02:12,192
WAS RELENTLESS.

60
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,527
>> WE MET THE COMMUNIST

61
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:16,429
CHALLENGE DEPENDS ON YOU.

62
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,298
BRET: NO CRITIC WAS FORCEFUL,

63
00:02:18,298 --> 00:02:20,667
MORE UNCOMPROMISING THAN

64
00:02:20,667 --> 00:02:23,203
REAGAN.

65
00:02:23,336 --> 00:02:24,104
SECURITY, OUR FREEDOM FROM THE

66
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:25,038
THREAT OF THE BOMB.

67
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,340
BY COMMITTING IMMORALITY SO

68
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,743
GREAT AS SAYING TO A BILLION

69
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:31,411
HUMAN BEINGS NOW ENSLAVED

70
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,847
BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN, GIVE

71
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:37,617
UP DREAMS OF FREEDOM BECAUSE TO

72
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,818
SAVE OUR OWN SKINS.

73
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:43,690
BRET: IN THE 70s HE OPPOSED THE

74
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,959
NIXON-FORD-KISSINGER POLICY OF

75
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:46,292
DETENTE.

76
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,861
>> MY VIEW OF DETENTE IS ONE OF

77
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:49,662
MAKING CONCESSIONS TO THE

78
00:02:49,662 --> 00:02:49,996
SOVIETS.

79
00:02:49,996 --> 00:02:50,997
WE GIVE THEM SOMETHING THEY

80
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:53,033
WANT VERY BADLY.

81
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:54,467
WE DON'T ASK ANYTHING IN

82
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:54,801
RETURN.

83
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,703
BRET: NEITHER THE SUMMITS MORE

84
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:59,239
ARMS CONTROL TREATIES STOPPED

85
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,241
THE SPREAD OF COMMUNISM AS

86
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,110
AMERICA LOOKED TO BE SLOWLY

87
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,112
LOSING THE COLD WAR.

88
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,580
AFTER HIS LOSS TO GERALD FORD

89
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,184
IN 1976, REAGAN SPOKE MOVING

90
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:11,851
ABOUT THE STAKES.

91
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:15,422
NOT SIMPLY THE FUTURE OF

92
00:03:15,422 --> 00:03:17,924
CIVILIZATION, THE SURVIVAL OF

93
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:18,358
CIVILIZATION.

94
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:21,561
>> SOMEONE ASKED ME TO WRITE A

95
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:23,863
LETTER FOR A TIME CAPSULE THAT

96
00:03:23,863 --> 00:03:24,664
IS GOING TO BE OPENED IN LOS

97
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:26,533
ANGELES 100 YEARS FROM NOW.

98
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,368
I SAID TO MYSELF WE LIVE IN A

99
00:03:28,368 --> 00:03:29,536
WORLD WHICH THE GREAT POWERS

100
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,271
HAVE AIMED AT EACH OTHER

101
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:31,905
HORRIBLE MISSILES OF

102
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:32,772
DESTRUCTION THAT CAN IN A

103
00:03:32,772 --> 00:03:34,474
MATTER OF MINUTES ARRIVE IN

104
00:03:34,474 --> 00:03:36,576
EACH OTHER'S COUNTRY AND

105
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,043
DESTROY.

106
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,044
THOSE WHO WOULD READ THIS

107
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:39,779
LETTER 100 YEARS FROM NOW, WILL

108
00:03:39,779 --> 00:03:41,014
KNOW WHETHER THOSE MISSILES

109
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:42,549
WERE FIRED.

110
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:45,452
THEY WILL KNOW WHETHER WE MET

111
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:46,653
OUR CHALLENGE?

112
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:48,254
BRET: FORD HIMSELF LOST TO

113
00:03:48,254 --> 00:03:50,423
JIMMY CARTER WHILE THE SOVIETS

114
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:53,593
ADDED SATELLITE STATES IN ASIA,

115
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:54,227
AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA.

116
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:57,831
[CHEERS]

117
00:03:57,831 --> 00:04:00,667
WHEN REAGAN RAN AGAIN IN 1980,

118
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,135
HIS ANTI-COMMUNISM SEEMED TO

119
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,903
MANY OUT OF STEP WITH THE

120
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:04,204
TIMES.

121
00:04:04,204 --> 00:04:06,773
BUT HE WON IN A LANDSLIDE.

122
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:08,408
USING HIS FIRST PRESS

123
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:11,544
CONFERENCE AS PRESIDENT TO,

124
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,079
AGAIN, DENOUNCE COMMUNISM.

125
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,348
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WHAT DO YOU

126
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:18,051
SEE AS THE LONG RANGE

127
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,952
INTENTIONS OF THE SOVIET UNION.

128
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,322
>> I KNOW OF NO LEADER OF THE

129
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:23,656
SOVIET UNION THAT HAS NOT MORE

130
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:27,093
THAN ONE REPEATED THEIR

131
00:04:27,093 --> 00:04:27,861
DETERMINATION THAT THEIR GOAL

132
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:31,231
MUST BE THE PROMOTION OF WORLD

133
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,934
REVOLUTION AND A ONE WORLD,

134
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:37,837
SOCIALIST OR COMMUNIST, STATE.

135
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:39,372
BRET: AN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

136
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:40,340
INTENSIFIED HIS ZEAL, NOT

137
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,741
MERELY TO FIGHT THE COLD WAR,

138
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:43,977
BUT TO WIN IT.

139
00:04:43,977 --> 00:04:46,713
HE AND POPE JOHN PAUL II WHO

140
00:04:46,713 --> 00:04:48,681
MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVED AN

141
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:49,883
ASSASSIN'S BULLET SIX WEEKS

142
00:04:49,883 --> 00:04:52,085
AFTER REAGAN AGREED THAT GOD

143
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:53,887
SPARED THEM SO THEY COULD END

144
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,956
COMMUNISM AND COLLAPSE THE

145
00:04:56,956 --> 00:04:58,458
SOVIET UNION.

146
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,727
>> WON'T CONTAIN COMMUNISM, IT

147
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:01,694
WILL TRANSCEND COMMUNISM.

148
00:05:01,694 --> 00:05:05,732
>> WHEN I CAME IN IN 1982,

149
00:05:05,732 --> 00:05:08,468
REAGAN WAS STILL IN FULL

150
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:11,671
THROATED DENUNCIATION OF THE

151
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:12,205
SOVIET UNION.

152
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:13,806
HE WAS STILL VERY MUCH PLAYING

153
00:05:13,806 --> 00:05:15,942
THE COLD WARRIOR.

154
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,645
>> WHAT I'M STRIKE NOW IS A

PLAN TO HOPE FOR THE LONG TERM,

156
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,751
THE MARCH OF FREEDOM AND

157
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:27,754
DEMOCRACY THAT WILL LEAVE

158
00:05:27,754 --> 00:05:29,489
MARXISM AND LENINISM.

159
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,524
BRET: THE COLD WAR WAS

160
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:31,891
WINNABLE.

161
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:33,226
>> THERE WAS A HUGE ARGUMENT

162
00:05:33,226 --> 00:05:35,094
WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION.

163
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:35,962

DEPARTMENT AND THE CIA BOTH

165
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,632
THOUGHT THE SOVIET UNION WAS

166
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:41,768
THERE AT THE TIME.

167
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:43,369
WE'RE HERE, THEY'RE THERE,

168
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,370
THAT'S LIFE.

169
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,004
GET ALONG.

170
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:45,972
>> THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SEEMED

171
00:05:45,972 --> 00:05:48,007
TO AGREE, NEARLY THREE QUARTERS

172
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:49,943
FAVORED A NUCLEAR FREEZE BY THE

173
00:05:49,943 --> 00:05:50,944
UNITED STATES AND SOVIET UNION.

174

>> I URGE YOU TO BEWARE THE

175
00:05:53,346 --> 00:05:56,249
TEMPTATION OF PRIDE, THE

176
00:05:56,249 --> 00:05:58,017
TEMPTATION OF BLITHELY,

177
00:05:58,017 --> 00:05:59,786
DECLARING YOURSELF ABOVE IT

178
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:00,053
ALL.

179
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,854
BRET: THAT SPARKED REAGAN'S

180
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,323
MOST FORCEFUL CRITICISM EVER OF

181
00:06:03,323 --> 00:06:04,224
THE SOVIET UNION.

182
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:06,059
>> TO IGNORE THE FACTS OF

183
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:07,827
HISTORY AND AGGRESSIVE IMPULSES

184
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:08,962
OF EVIL EMPIRE.

185
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:11,264
TO CALL THE ARMS RACE A GIANT

UNDERSTANDING AND THERE BY

187
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,767
REMOVE YOURSELF FROM THE

STRUGGLE BETWEEN RIGHT AND

189
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:17,270
WRONG AND GOOD AND EVIL.

190
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,172

REAGAN'S STANDARDS THAT WAS

196
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:27,680
PRETTY BLUNT AND PRETTY RAW.

197
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,649
>> I REMEMBER JUST ASKING

198
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:31,384

MIND WHEN HE CALLED THEM THE

201
00:06:34,621 --> 00:06:36,556
EVIL EMPIRE?

202

203
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,859
STATEMENT FOR A PRESIDENT TO

204
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,327

205
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,196
AND WE JUST DECIDED THAT HE

00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:45,565
REALLY FELT HE COULD MAKE

207
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:46,232
THINGS BETTER.

208
00:06:46,232 --> 00:06:48,101

00:06:48,101 --> 00:06:49,469
THE COLD WAR FROM THE BEGINNING

210
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:51,638

211
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:51,904

212
00:06:51,904 --> 00:06:55,341

213
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:56,809
PRINCIPLED PRAGMATIST WHOSE

214
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,378
STRONGEST SUIT IS KNOWING WHAT

215
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:00,079
HE BELIEVED AND WHY HE BELIEVED

216
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,346
IT.

217
00:07:00,346 --> 00:07:01,547
>> HE HAD A SYSTEM OF GOING

218
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:02,582
ABOUT THINGS.

219
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,384

00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,323
MORE THAN THAT.
