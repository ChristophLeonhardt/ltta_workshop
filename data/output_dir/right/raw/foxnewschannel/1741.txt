1
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:10,915
>> Shannon: WE REPORTED LAST

2
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:11,583
WEEK ON THE POSSIBILITY THAT

3
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:12,984
SOMEONE INSIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

4
00:00:12,984 --> 00:00:13,718
CAMPAIGN WAS A SECRET FBI

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:14,385
SOURCE.

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:15,253
TO MAKE THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE

7
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:18,189
COMMITTEE WANTS TO KNOW MORE.

8
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:19,190
>> THE REASON WHY A LOT OF US

9
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,994
WERE SUSPICIOUS IS BECAUSE GWEN

10
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:24,896
SIMPSON AT ONE POINT, THE HEAD

11
00:00:24,896 --> 00:00:25,630
OF FUSION GPS TESTIFIED THAT

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,564
THERE IS A HUMAN SOURCE INSIDE

13
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:31,236
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN BASED ON HIS

14
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:31,936
CONVERSATIONS WITH CHRISTOPHER

15
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:32,270
STEELE.

16
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,137
>> Shannon: FORMER CHIEF

17
00:00:33,137 --> 00:00:36,674
ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY ANDREW

18
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:38,610
McCARTHY JOINS US LIVE WITH

19
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:38,977
REACTION.

20
00:00:38,977 --> 00:00:41,579
GREAT DADDY WITH US.

21
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,480
I'M GOING TO TWEET IT OUT

22
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,982
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY

23
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:45,183
IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO AREN'T

24
00:00:45,183 --> 00:00:45,884
AS FAMILIAR WITH THIS CASE

25
00:00:45,884 --> 00:00:47,585
PRETTY WELL IN THE FACTS, THE

26
00:00:47,585 --> 00:00:49,387
NAMES, THE DATES OF EVERYBODY

27
00:00:49,387 --> 00:00:49,754
INVOLVED.

28
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:51,022
IT'S VERY INFORMATIVE.

29
00:00:51,022 --> 00:00:52,423
GLENN SIMPSON, COFOUNDER OF

30
00:00:52,423 --> 00:00:53,124
FUSION GPS IS A KEY PLAYER IN

31
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:55,126
THIS WHOLE THING.

32
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:56,794
HE TOLD LAWMAKERS ONE THING,

33
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:58,463
KIND OF TRIED TO BACKPEDAL AND

34
00:00:58,463 --> 00:00:59,998
NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S BACK TO

35
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:01,599
SAYING WHAT I ORIGINALLY TOLD

36
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,301
YOU ABOUT THE SOURCING AND THE

37
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:03,835
START OF THIS WHOLE

38
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,370
INVESTIGATION WAS RIGHT.

39
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,572
>> IT'S INTERESTING.

40
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:11,776
THE TESTIMONY HE GAVE WAS THAT

41
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,611
CHRISTOPHER STEELE, THE FORMER

42
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,346
BRITISH SPY WHO WAS THE AUTHOR

43
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:17,248
OF THE DOSSIER TOLD HIM THAT THE

44
00:01:17,248 --> 00:01:20,551
FBI TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD A

45
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:23,421
SOURCE INSIDE THE CAMPAIGN.

46
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:26,824
WHEN THAT BECAME A BIG

47
00:01:26,824 --> 00:01:27,959
CONTROVERSY AFTER HE SAID IT, HE

48
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,395
TRIED TO WALK IT BACK.

49
00:01:30,395 --> 00:01:31,596
IN THE WAY HE WALKED IT BACK WAS

50
00:01:31,596 --> 00:01:33,765
TO TRY TO THROW IT OFF ON THIS

51
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:35,767
GUY PAPADOPOULOS, WHO HAD HAD

52
00:01:35,767 --> 00:01:37,502
THIS CONVERSATION WITH THE U.S.

53
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:38,036
AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMAT.

54
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,604
THAT WHOLE STORY.

55
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:40,805
IT DOESN'T LINE UP TIMEWISE

56
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:41,439
BECAUSE WHEN HE GAVE THE

57
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,409
TESTIMONY IN AUGUST, THAT STORY

58
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,543
WAS NOT PUBLISHED UNTIL ABOUT

59
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:47,779
FIVE MONTHS LATER SO IT'S HIGHLY

60
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,280
UNLIKELY HE COULD HAVE KNOWN

61
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:49,847
ABOUT IT.

62
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:52,817
BUT WHAT I LEARNED THIS EVENING

63
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:53,718
IS THAT ON THE JUDICIARY, THE

64
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:56,421
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S

65
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:57,155
WEBSITE, SIMPSON'S LAWYER,

66
00:01:57,155 --> 00:02:00,224
SIMPSON WAS ASKED BY THE

67
00:02:00,224 --> 00:02:01,025
COMMITTEE, IF YOU CHANGED YOUR

68
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:02,160
MIND ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID,

69
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,995
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T LET US IN ON

70
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:04,796
THAT?

71
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:05,530
AND THE LAWYER FOR SIMPSON GAVE

72
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,633
A SHORT LETTER TO CHAIRMAN

73
00:02:08,633 --> 00:02:11,202
GRASSLEY SAYING HE STANDS BY HIS

74
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:11,636
TESTIMONY.

75
00:02:11,636 --> 00:02:13,204
>> Shannon: THE ORIGINAL

76
00:02:13,204 --> 00:02:15,206
TESTIMONY THAT HE SAID TO

77
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:16,441
SIMPSON THAT THE FBI TOLD STEELE

78
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:19,844
THERE WAS AN INFORMANT OR

79
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:20,611
SOMEBODY WAS GIVING OUT

80
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,612
INFORMATION ON SOURCE INSIDE THE

81
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:23,014
TRUMP CAMPAIGN.

82
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:23,848
HE'S BACK TO THAT STORY?

83
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:24,615
>> HIS BACK TO THE STORY THAT

84
00:02:24,615 --> 00:02:26,250
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD HIM.

85
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,953
I WOULD UNDERSCORE HERE THAT HE

86
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:30,989
AND STEELE HAVE A LENGTHY

87
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:31,723
RELATIONSHIP AND COLLABORATION.

88
00:02:31,723 --> 00:02:33,157
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS

89
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:36,394
HIGHLY UNLIKELY HE WAS CONFUSED.

90
00:02:36,394 --> 00:02:37,595
>> Shannon: ANY HINTS OR

91
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,397
THOUGHTS, AND YOU MAY HAVE YOUR

92
00:02:39,397 --> 00:02:40,832
OWN THEORY, EVERYBODY HAS

93
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:44,068
THEORIES, EVERYBODY IS SHARING

94
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:44,836
SOMEBODY INSIDE THE TRUMP

95
00:02:44,836 --> 00:02:45,837
CAMPAIGN STARTED WORKING WITH

96
00:02:45,837 --> 00:02:46,204
THE FEDS.

97
00:02:46,204 --> 00:02:48,039
WAS IT SOMEBODY THEY PUSHED INTO

98
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,540
THAT CIRCLE THAT THEY THEN USED

99
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,808
FOR INFORMATION?

100
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:51,242
ANY IDEAS?

101
00:02:51,242 --> 00:02:53,444
>> I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH

102
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:54,245
YET BUT I WOULD SO EXPECT THERE

103
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:55,947
NOT BE JUST ONE BECAUSE IT SEEMS

104
00:02:55,947 --> 00:02:57,982
LIKE -- WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN

105
00:02:57,982 --> 00:03:01,085
RECENT DAYS IS THAT THERE WAS A

106
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:03,121
WHOLE OTHER THING GOING ON

107
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:03,488
OVERSEAS.

108
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:06,124
NOT IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN SORT

109
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:08,626
OF WHERE THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WAS

110
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:11,396
LOCATED, BUT DEALING WITH TRUMP

111
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:12,130
PEOPLE WERE IN BRITAIN

112
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,298
SPECIFICALLY AND THAT LOOKS LIKE

113
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,601
A FRUITFUL --

114
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:17,268
>> Shannon: INTERESTING BIT

115
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:19,037
FROM "THE NEW YORK TIMES" ON

116
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:21,406
SATURDAY, INCREASINGLY TOP

117
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,140
OFFICIALS AT THE JUSTICE

118
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,807
DEPARTMENT HAVE PRIVATELY

119
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:24,609
EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THE

120
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:25,810
LAWMAKERS ARE SIMPLY MINING

121
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,445
GOVERNMENT SECRETS THEY CAN

122
00:03:27,445 --> 00:03:28,046
WEAPONIZE AGAINST THOSE

123
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,381
INVESTIGATING THE PRESIDENT,

124
00:03:30,381 --> 00:03:31,382
INCLUDING THE SPECIAL COUNSEL,

125
00:03:31,382 --> 00:03:32,583
ROBERT S MULLER THE THIRD.

126
00:03:32,583 --> 00:03:35,186
HOW DO YOU WEAPONIZE INFORMATION

127
00:03:35,186 --> 00:03:36,788
NOT SOMETHING NEFARIOUS ABOUT

128
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:37,055
IT?

129
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:38,990
>> I JUST THINK THAT IS SO

130
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,791
OVERSTATED.

131
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,993
AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE

132
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:44,262
MAKING A VERY NARROW REQUEST FOR

133
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:45,029
INFORMATION.

134
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:45,696
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY

135
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:48,633
NECESSARILY NEED THE NAME OF THE

136
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:49,200
INFORMANT.

137
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,803
BUT WHAT THEY NEED TO FIND OUT

138
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:53,204
IS WAS THERE ONE, THAT'S THE

139
00:03:53,204 --> 00:03:56,307
IMPORTANT THING, AND I THINK,

140
00:03:56,307 --> 00:03:58,743
SHANNON, EVERYBODY SENSIBLE

141
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:02,980
WOULD AGREE THAT IF THERE WAS A

142
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,782
CERTAIN QUANTUM OF EVIDENCE THAT

143
00:04:04,782 --> 00:04:06,684
WAS SERIOUS THAT WE HAD A

144
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:07,385
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO WAS

145
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,587
IN CAHOOTS WITH THE PUTIN

146
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,155
REGIME, PARTICULARLY TARGETING

147
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:12,623
OUR ELECTION SYSTEM, THAT WOULD

148
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:13,558
BE SOMETHING THAT CRIED OUT TO

149
00:04:13,558 --> 00:04:14,859
BE INVESTIGATED.

150
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:16,360
BUT I THINK THEY NEED TO SHOW

151
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,962
THAT THEY HAD A CERTAIN

152
00:04:17,962 --> 00:04:19,997
THRESHOLD OF EVIDENCE BEFORE

153
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,833
THEY STARTED TO AGGRESSIVELY

154
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,500
INVESTIGATE A PRESIDENTIAL

155
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,601
CAMPAIGN AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

156
00:04:23,601 --> 00:04:25,036
TRYING TO FIND OUT, DID THEY?

157
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:25,870
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK WE

158
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,206
WILL GET THAT TIME ON, THE WHO,

159
00:04:28,206 --> 00:04:30,274
WHEN, WHERE, EXACTLY WHAT

160
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:31,442
LAUNCHED THIS FBI INVESTIGATION?

161
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:32,043
>> I DO.

162
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:33,177
I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS WE WILL

163
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,078
GET IT.

164
00:04:34,078 --> 00:04:35,713
I KNOW THEY ARE ALL INTO LET'S

165
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,181
LOOK IN THEIR FILES AND LOOK IN

166
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,216
THE INFORMANT FILE.

167
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:42,787
AND I SPENT WEEKEND LOOKING AT

168
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:43,988
THE TEXT MESSAGES BETWEEN PETER

169
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:48,192
AND LISA PAGE.

170
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:49,794
AGENT, THE FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE

171
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:51,429
WHO WAS THE COUNSEL TO THE

172
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:53,431
DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE FBI,

173
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:55,800
ANDREW McCABE.

174
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,970
THEY ARE A DAY BY DAY NARRATIVE

175
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,838
OF WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE

176
00:05:00,838 --> 00:05:02,406
INVESTIGATION AND THEY ARE

177
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:03,207
CONSTANTLY IN COMMUNICATION.

178
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:03,841
SO WITH RESPECT TO EVERY

179
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:06,811
DECISION THAT GOT MADE AND THE

180
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:08,012
DELIBERATION OVER IT, THESE TWO

181
00:05:08,012 --> 00:05:08,813
ARE WEIGHING IN.

182
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:10,848
WE DON'T KNOW AS MUCH AS WE

183
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:12,817
COULD NO ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THEY

184
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:15,019
HAVE MASSIVELY REDACTED IT, BUT

185
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,721
THE WINDOW WE HAVE INDICATES TO

186
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,190
ME THAT IF YOU GOT TO SEE THAT

187
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,024
IT WOULD ANSWER A LOT OF

188
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:20,391
QUESTIONS.

189
00:05:20,391 --> 00:05:21,726
>> Shannon: WE DO HAVE A LOT

190
00:05:21,726 --> 00:05:22,160
