COMEY.
SIX MONTHS AFTER CLAPPER TALKED
ABOUT THE DOSSIER WITH TAPPER,
THE ANALYST WAS HIRED BY CNN.
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
WITH MARKHAM AND YOUR
CONGRESSMAN PETER KING WHO SITS
ON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN GOING
ON.
CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO HAVE YOU
HERE WITH US.
I WANT TO PLAY JONATHAN TURLEY
WHO'S ON THE SHOW A LOT.
THIS IS HIM THIS MORNING TALKING
ABOUT THE TIMING ON WHAT JAMES
CLAPPER HAS SAID.
>> CLAPPER HAS ALREADY ADMITTED
THAT HE DID SPEAK WITH CNN.
NOW HE IS INSISTING THAT HE
DIDN'T SPEAK TO ANY MEDIA UNTIL
JANUARY 20TH, BUT HE INDICATED
THAT HE SPOKE TO CNN IN EARLY
JANUARY.
CNN REPORTED THAT HIGH LEVEL
PEOPLE HAD CONFIRMED THIS
INFORMATION WITH HIM.
IF ONE OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS
KLAPPER, THEN HE HAS A SERIOUS
PROBLEM.
HE COULD BE ACCUSED AGAIN OF
PERJURY.
>> Martha: WHAT DID HE TELL
YOUR COMMITTEE?
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           I
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           T
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           L
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           I
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           E
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           C
THE HOUSE INCREDIBLE           E
COMMITTEE, ABOUT THE TIMING OF
THIS?
>> FIRST, HE DENIED EVER
SPEAKING TO CNN ABOUT IT.
BEING INVOLVED IN LEAKING AT
ALL.
AND THEN WHEN HE WAS CONFRONTED,
HE SAID HE MAY HAVE SPOKEN TO
TAPPER AND IT WAS INCONCLUSIVE.
CERTAINLY MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT
HE SPOKE TO JAKE TAPPER,
SOMEBODY AT CNN, IN EARLY
JANUARY.
THAT COMMENT TO ME, IS TOTALLY
-- SOMEBODY LIKE THAT SPOKEN TO
THE MEDIA, THIS IS ONLY KNOWN BY
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.
THE WHOLE CONDUCT OF JOHN
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER DURING THAT
PERIOD, THERE WERE LEAKS COMING
FROM EVERYWHERE IN THE INTEL
COMMUNITY.
THIS DOSSIER AS JAMES COMEY TOLD
THE PRESIDENT, THE
PRESIDENT-ELECT AT THE TIME, SEE
AND THEN HAD THE DOSSIER, THERE
WASN'T ANY EXCUSE TO RELEASE IT,
HE WANTED TO GIVE IT TO THE
PRESIDENT-ELECT SO HE WOULD BE
AWARE WHAT'S IN IT.
A DAY OR TWO AGO OR THREE DAYS,
CERTAINLY CNN IS GOING WITH IT.
TURNS OUT NOW THAT CLAPPER DID
TALK TO JAKE TAPPER DURING THAT
PERIOD SO I THINK THERE IS A
REAL PERJURY ISSUE.
A WHOLE ISSUE OF LEAKS IN THE
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
>> Martha: WILL YOU ASK HIM TO
COME BACK TO CLARIFY THESE
THINGS?
>> WE MAY NOW.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, THIS IS
GOING TO BE SENT I BELIEVE TO
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.
THEY SHOULD LOOK AT IT.
IT'S REALLY UP FOR THEM.
THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE TO CLARIFY
IT IF YOU WANTED TO.
WHEN HE WAS SHOWING IT, THE
DIRECT RELATION CAME BACK AND HE
SEEMED TO BE CONFUSED.
BUT RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS WE ARE
CONCERNED, OUR REPORT IS DONE.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL HAVE
IT.
I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD LOOK AT IT
CAREFULLY AND PROBABLY TAKE
ACTION.
>> Martha: THERE IS A COUPLE
OF DISCREPANCIES TOO IN THE
STORY.
HERE'S WHAT THE CNN REPORT SAID
IN JANUARY 12TH WHEN THEY BROKE
THE STORY AND WE KNOW JAMES
COMEY SAID WHEN HE WAS
INTERVIEWED FOR THE BOOK THAT HE
KNEW THAT CNN WAS LOOKING FOR A
NEWS HOOK IN ORDER TO START
WRITING ABOUT THE DOSSIER
BECAUSE THERE WAS SORT OF
GENERALLY KNOWN THERE WAS
SOMETHING OUT THERE.
BUT ONCE THEY SAT DOWN WITH THE
PRESIDENT AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT
IT, THAT GAVE THEM THE LEAK THAT
THEY NEEDED.
THEY SAID THE ALLEGATIONS WERE
PRESENTED IN A TWO PAGE SYNOPSIS
APPENDED ON A REPORT ON RUSSIAN
INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016
ELECTION.
THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN THE CNN
REPORT.
NOW WATCH HOW IT IS WITH
BRET BAIER.
>> CNN REPORTED AT THE TIME YOU
HANDED A TWO PAGE EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY FROM THE DOSSIER OVER TO
HIM.
>> I DID NOT.
>> DID NOT.
>> Martha: WHAT DID YOU MAKE
OF THAT?
>> IT SEEMS TO ME THESE GUYS
NEED TO GET THEIR STORIES
STRAIGHT.
THAT AGAIN, TO ME THAT WHOLE
INTERVIEW WITH BRET BAIER BY THE
WAY IT IS AMAZING BECAUSE COMEY
WAS SAYING THINGS I KNOW IS NOT
TRUE.
CONTRADICTING THINGS HE SAID
BEFORE.
ALSO HIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE.
THE CONFUSION.
WHETHER IT IS HIM.
WHETHER IT IS MUSIC.
WHETHER IT IS SOMEBODY AT CNN.
THE FACT IS THIS AS A WHOLE DARK
PERIOD IN AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE
UNIT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
DECEMBER 6TH AND JANUARY 20TH,
IT'S REALLY SHAMEFUL.
HALF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY,
AND I PUT BRENNAN AND CLAPPER IN
THE CENTER OF THAT.
COMEY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS
WHOLE ROLE IS IN ALL OF THIS.
BUT I VIEW VERY SPECTACLE OF
BRENNAN AND CLAPPER.
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK THE IG
WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THIS?
>> ALL I KNOW, THE IG, DOES A
GREAT JOB.
CERTAINLY DID AN EXCELLENT JOB
WITH ANDREW MCCADE.
HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO IT.
I THINK THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD
LOOK AT IT TO ME WHEN IT COMES
TO THAT CLEAR CONTRADICTION IN
