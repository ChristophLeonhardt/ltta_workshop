okay thank you you you you good afternoon and welcome to battleground it is Monday July 16th and I'm David Menzies filling in for Ezra Levent who is on assignment as we like to say in this business by the way I just noticed it says that battleground starts at 12 p.m. that's not quite true it's 12 noon and I'm telling you this folks because last August I successfully fought a parking ticket because I was not allowed to park well actually the way the sign was written was 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. and I went to court to prove that there's no such thing as 12 a.m. and 12 p.m. and you know what I won so anyone who's got any kind of parking ticket in which they use AM and PM with the number 12 just take my precedent that the men Zoid said last August in Toronto and go to court and you will defeat that parking ticket I think the parking ticket was $30 I probably spent I don't know 300 dollars in research fighting it but still I fought it and for now on please it's 12 noon and 12 midnight I'll pass that on to our team of trained broadcast professionals so did you have a good weekend it was roasting in southern Ontario I guess the bad news is the World Cup soccer is over and the good news is the world cup of soccer is over yes France has won a me and accounting it's always someone like a me and accounting isn't it that wins the soccer pool someone who isn't tied to the sport but anyways I'm not gonna say anything more about soccer if anyone tuned in on Friday you know my position my four points for making soccer a good game which is to say more like ice hockey put boards around the pitch so that bloody ball doesn't fly out of bounds every 10 seconds eliminate diving in other words kick out the players or give them red cards whoever does that so this is incumbent on the refs because soccer players will never change their behavior that way eliminate those penalty kicks you know if something goes into overtime played till you drop be like men okay not not that cakes from ten yards out and also bigger nets we like lots of scoring here in North America we don't like one nil games and nil nil games so bigger nets or failing that just have goalkeepers who are midgets and you know what I'd I I would tune in just for that and so what else is happening i someone was just speaking Malay year Justin could you say what you were just saying to me B oh all right then we have French hooligans there you go now look at it now this is in France right yeah you know this is very interesting as you can see hooligans there's been a car overturned these are the winners you know these aren't the losers right this isn't like what happens in you know Vancouver every few years or so when the Vancouver Canucks blow the Stanley Cup final you know and and the citizens react by going on a rampage I I'm not condoning it but I can understand the anger but this is a new phenomena in the last 10 to 15 years I'd say regardless of the sport and that is whoever the championship team is the fans act as hooligans the overturned cars they vandalize buildings but but why you your team one should you be joyous and happy you know folks I remember Oh way way back in 1992 and 1993 when the Toronto Blue Jays won back-to-back World Series and I can tell you back then you had cops estimated a million people on the streets of Toronto jumping up and down in jubilation and there was virtually no reports none of damage vandalism assaults so what changed what why why do the fans of a winning team like France why would they were spawned like that I can't quite figure that out and I don't think it's a French thing because when American sports teams win I remember there was this problem in in Dallas a while back Philadelphia if you've got any theories please weigh in and of course happy to read your comments if you can kick in a buck or two or five that makes it a super chat and we guarantee to read it and there you go and I'll just check the what's coming in so far and well here we have alcohol and drugs make some do this from synth works yeah I agree you know that is a contributing factor but I'll tell you there were going back to 92 93 with all those blue jay fans there were some very drunken people there but they were they were good drunks not not evil drunks not bad drunk it's not mean drunk so again I don't think it's just that and then we have amandajoy again fans full of booze and stupidity I think more heavily on the stupidity and again a synth works as mindless gum well you know what since work say using that kind of terminology gets you in trouble with the left I mean at a commentary last week where Mayor John Tory for calling gang bangers who shot at two innocent little girls in a playground he called them justifiably so in my opinion sewer rats and members of the left such as Desmond Cole came out saying how dare the mayor stigmatized an entire community like that by the way the mayor didn't even know the race of the shooters when he made that comment so really husband who is the racist in that case and let's see what else we have let's be honest it's a crowd like this oh and just lost that quote and there you go and I also saw way up at the top to start things off somebody mentioned something about a Sadiq Khan balloon and was it there was another factor but do we have that I'm having a little trouble scroll here we are bear with me folks okay anyway is from V z IX anyone seen the balloon of Sadiq Khan being blanketed by a pig well I'll tell you I don't know if that's a true thing or not I know there was a fundraiser to make a Sadiq Khan balloon if they're putting a pig in there given the way the UK is and given the fact that there's what nine hundred police officers I'm just looking at the giant Sadiq Khan baby balloon image right now of course that's a that's a doctorate image I don't think that's that's actually happened yet but if you're gonna add in the pig or any kind of bacon reference of course that's going to be interpreted as a hate crime and not only will the balloon be grounded the people behind the balloon will be grounded as in grounded in prison because that's the way they roll in the UK in terms of freedom of speech so and you know what they might even consider just a balloon of Sadiq Khan I hate crime too depending on the interpretation but I have not seen that yet but I'd sure like to I'll tell you that much and so what else do we have here okay then ton is a disgrace to politics and that's from a Czech nationalist I tend to agree and so in the news what happened in the State of Israel on the weekend well in the town of stir odd and I was in that town just two weeks ago with my fellow rebels such as Katie Hopkins and Ezra Levant and Sheila gun Reid and the rest and we it's an incredible town folks it's about 28,000 people and it is the closest town in Israel to Gaza so therefore when there's going to be a deluge of rockets this is target numero uno and such was the case on the weekend Rockets were fired into the town of Sir doubt and there was some damage I think four people were injured and of course if you read the mainstream media the everyone is upset about Israel retaliating but really what are you supposed to do this is Israel sovereign land and yeah there's the CNN report you in urges Israel and Gaza to step back from the brink of war well you know a couple of things folks do you know in Israel I found this hilarious no matter who we spoke to IDF people people living on a kibbutz individual citizens you see these UN vehicles these black and white vehicles all over Israel and in virtually the entire nation refers to them as the United nothing's they just drive around fly around they're observing observing and then when something like this happens they condemn and typically they condemn Israel and the funny thing is too is that you know when it comes to Israel defending itself it's always a case of disproportionate force right let's see we're looking at some video footage now of the Israeli military taking out some installations there probably where the Rockets came from but you know in the history of war I can't remember this being a thing you know this whole idea that you responded in a disproportionate manner I mean if the Romans were going to fight the Phoenicians and you know the field general learns that you know of the Phoenicians have 25 boats and 400 men so therefore we should only send out 25 boats and 400 men now if I want to win I'm going to send out a hundred boats and 3,000 men so that's typically how war is always being played but not when it comes to Israel just trying to defend itself its borders and its citizens and you know Sarat it's a very interesting town folks in that they have playgrounds and the prints between playgrounds in Seurat and the rest of the world pretty much is that their indoor playgrounds even though the climate is beautiful you could play outdoor outdoors all year-round and that is just so that kids have a chance of growing into adults and not being incinerated on an outdoor playground I mean it's just so perverse it's kind of like hey kids it's a beautiful day let's get inside and play that is the way life is and I really take my hat off to the people living there because they're not backing down despite all these rockets going in despite damage injuries even fatalities the population of this town is increasing and by the way there's some video footage that we shot as you can see there's the lovely Sheila Gunn read I think she's the one that coined stir dogs being the bomb shelter capital of the world and she's probably right about that on a per capita basis and you know the population is 28,000 I believe which is an increase of a thousands more since one of the last horrific attacks a few years ago so there we go and I'll go to the board see what's happening and we have from Nolan Baptiste as Canadians need to protect our own border to our country safe or to keep our country safe I think you mean to say no and you know you're right and it's funny you mentioned that gnome because I couldn't help but notice one of the people the weigh in on the Israeli action on the weekend was good old Alexandria o Cassio Cortes you know she's the US congressional candidate for the Democrats for the Bronx and queens and this is the person if you recall once the elimination of ice okay yeah she wants immigration and customs enforcement in the US eliminated and she's talking about the occupation of Palestine I just find it perversely ironic that this woman is talking about an occupation of Palestine but once the apparatus in the United States removed so that the United States can be occupied by well anybody she's one of these you know people that believe no one is illegal and that a nation shouldn't have control over its own borders in fact it shouldn't be borders so it's kind of funny to see how she uses the word occupation and I think we have a clip of her my wonderful producer friend Alex is waving and you'll see some of the nonsense that comes out of her mouth this is from a previous interview but let's check out mrs. Cortez ice and you recently traveled to the border to Tornillo Texas to see the shelters to see where some of these separated families are being held what would you replace ice with and do we not need protection at the border well we absolutely absolutely do need to make sure that our borders are secured to make sure that people are safe and passage but what we need to realize and remember is that ice was established in 2003 right at the same time as the Patriot Act the AUMF the Iraq war and we look back at a lot of that time and legislation as as a mistake now and I think that ice is right there as a part of it extra extra traditional nature is baked in to the structure of the agency and that is why they're able to get away with black you know with black sites at our border with a separation of children we are we are committing human rights abuses on this border and separating children from their families and what that you know is is part of the structure of the agency we can replace it and we can replace it with a humane agency that is directed towards safe passage what are you gonna do action I other the criminalization what do you mean black sites what do you mean about blacks really so I was just yes yes so actually we were just hopping off MSNBC and they were talking about it basically what we have is that people are not able to access even our own members of Congress are not able to access what is happening in these sites and that in and of itself the secretive nature and when we know that that children are being kept and that human rights abuses are happening in without any sort of transparency or accountability that is where we're at right now that is simply what is happening I would note those facilities run by by HHS but I know some of the lawmakers who have even gotten inside have not been able to see some of the children you know when you even have CNN interviewers looking in a very quizzical stunned fashion at what they're hearing you know you're in the real real deep end of left-wing lunacy you know I'm trying to figure out what she was trying to say there that we no longer need ice because times are different and we need a more humanitarian approach I think those were some of her words so I guess I don't know we have these good well ambassadors on the American border and when illegals come in because she in her world she doesn't want any kind of border control they ask really really nicely and maybe you know give a a daffodil or a rose and say could you please get in line and apply legally and in the meantime go back to Mexico or Nicaragua or wherever you walked over from you I I think that has a high percentile chance of working just absolutely incredible and we have I think another clip of her a more recent one guys do we have that one too yep ok here's a here's some more pithy prose from Miss Cortez but I am in terms of geopolitics and the world is very different than people expressing their First Amendment right to protest well yes but I also think that what people are starting to see at least in in the occupation of Palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions and that to me is just where I tend to come from on this issue you use the term the occupation of Palestine mmm what did you mean by that oh I think it what I meant is like the the settlements that are increasing and in some of these areas and places where or Palestinians are experiencing that difficulty and access to their housing and homes do you think you can expand on that yeah I mean I think I'd also just I I am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue well she got one thing right on the money I am NOT the expert on geopolitics on this issue you know in fairness folks she is only 28 and it shows and I think what she has to do is get out of the Bronx and book passage to Israel and get on the ground like we did and see what the real situation is and also she doesn't have to do that much she can learn that you know Israel's been out of Gaza for four years now and so what is she talking about in terms of occupation but you know this is part of the problem you know when we had the fact-finding mission to Israel last month and for the first week of July it was a terrific success and we had about 60 rebel fans with us and part of the problem I think folks is that people that were on this trip it was kind of preaching to the converted and that that's by the way I'm not that's not meant to be taken as an insult or a knock or anything else it's that these people have an understanding of what the situation is who we need on these trips are people like miss Cortez you know people that know nothing or have an ideological viewpoint of a situation that is akin to science fiction we need those kind of people to come on a trip to Israel and to visit a town like Surratt and see what the real situation is on the ground and then you won't have those kind of embarrassing interviews or at least I hope not I let's hope with age and experience and doing a little research she changes some of these kind of opinions but Wow that this is the new face of the Democrats now I mean it's her Bernie Sanders what's the name of the other one the one who's like - what - billions Indian Elizabeth Warren that's of what Oh getting so many names in my year right now and they're all a bunch of winners and they look on the bright side folks a second term for Donald Trump it's a slam dunk and let's see what else we have to say so check nationalist ways and again ideology collides with reality that's right and on the Left these days Czech nationalists it seems that ideology Trump's reality and someone asked Kendra a question mark I'm not sure what that reference is let's see Oh Kendra Oppenheim I don't know I'm not good with the Palestine Israel thing I guess you're referring to the two-state solution there I'm not a fan of the two-state solution either I'm a fan of the one state solution and partly because the two-state solution at one point would Jews Israel at its narrowest point to just 9 miles wide in other words it would be an indefensible country so there you have it let's see too legit to quit says experience hasn't helped Bernie in the least maybe there is hope for her well you know what you're right because I mean how old is Bernie right now I think they they don't give him birthday cakes anymore I think they just carbon date them but when he was in Ontario for a photo op I think it was just before the US election of course Kathleen Wynne was the premier there so you were talking to kindred spirits and they went to one of our hospitals and I believe it was a migrant our refugee was being treated in a hospital bed and Bernie looked around and his quote was you mean all of this is free and Kathleen Wynne and all the minions were nodding no it's not Bernie you should see what our tax threshold is but nevertheless the Toronto Star reported it glowingly as look how wonderful our free care for Refugees is here in Ontario in Toronto unbelievable so yes age and experience is not being kind to Bernie so for toxic chat says Israel needs a gay black gender to be the prime minister in the name of diversity well you know what I don't think that would be enough because one of the things I noticed also in Israel we were driving around Tel Aviv and we passed by a couple of stores and they had the LGBTQ rainbow flags on display and I wish I had time to get off the bus and talked to the store keepers there because I'd love to get their opinion in terms of here in Toronto until very recently we had four years of the gay pride parade a group called queers against Israeli Apartheid now it's perverse on so many levels folks first of all there is no apartheid in Israel so if the very name of your organization is based on a lie then what is the real agenda I would suggest it's nothing more than good old-fashioned anti-semitism and the second thing is she riddled me this which is the only country and that all of the Middle East that has not one but two gay pride parades every year well yes it is Israel because if you're have a gay pride parade or even fly that flag in so many other Middle Eastern countries in the neighbourhood in which Israel resides you are cruisin for a bruisin to say the least so yeah the idea of having a person of color transgender whatever that descriptor was still there would be a hate on for Israel because these parades are are already taking place in Israel and instead of Israel being applauded we have floats in gay pride parades in the West denouncing Israeli Apartheid and this is on behalf of queers unbelievable couldn't make it up and let's see what else do we have so pH dcraven warhead anti-semitism laughing my ass off lmao I believe that's what they say well I don't know what you're laughing about did I get that wrong I mean if there is no apartheid and that's part of your name and your name is based on a lie then what do you think the real reason is please educate me there and since works rights apparently their flags are highly flammable oh for sure and if they're not they'll find some incendiary device to make them flammable and let's see we have oh yeah open borders for Israel from PhD Craven we're head again well I'd say even with the wall and the fence you have problem so could you imagine if there were hoping borders for Israel and the Grimm reefer rights LGBT IQ ip+ I think you know you're missing some letters there I know Stephen LeDrew got fired from cp24 after spending some twenty years there remember he was defending the acronym with a and he was on the Tucker Carlson show on Fox and I think that LGBT thingamabob er was up to sixteen letters I could never possibly remember them all but maybe that's a you know a good idea for now on just put LGBTQ and plus and the plus refers to whatever the current number of initials are and El Chapo Guerra writes Israel should take over the Mideast we know the funny thing is is Israel is the military superpower in the Middle East and it could if it wanted to level its enemies but Israel fights with perhaps both hands tied behind its back but certainly from the display of the air force that we saw the Israeli Air Force enter when they were graduating those cadets almost two weeks ago the the firepower at its disposal if it really chose to act in a disproportionate manner well their enemies would be vanquished that's for sure and let's see Mark Jones is anti-semitic what exactly is it anyway criticism of Judea explained David well no I'm just saying mark that this particular group queers against Israeli Apartheid has the use of word apartheid in its title there is no apartheid in Israel so why would you use the word apartheid so I'm guessing they're simply anti-semitic because the name is based on a lie so if you've got another theory let me hear it and Mark Jones also writes Saudi Arabia spends more dollars that might be true but I wonder what the the ability of the Saudi army as we've seen on several occasions Israel whether it was the six days war the Yom Kippur War defending itself against combined Arab nations and always winning see we have Jim Olynyk Israel equals monopolist for shooting strangers well I'm not sure what that means I mean if you're I guess protesters that are throwing makeshift bombs and Molotov cocktails I guess they are strangers but if they're committing a criminal act like that and they're not moving back well then you have to shoot them they're carrying out acts of violence and let's see Kendra Oppenheim again some have a crazy theory that LGBT is now designed to push for PTO's I guess that means pedophiles because look how many there are in the media well I don't know if that's true certainly we had it wasn't a pedophile but Ben Levin who one of the architects of the now dismissed sex ed curriculum was into child pornography and did jail time for that even the creation of child pornography but if you can give us some names on the public record fire away and right now moving on speaking of the sex ed curriculum premiere Doug Ford he's back in the news again today as well he is introducing his party his government rather is introducing back to work legislation for all the teaching assistants and contract workers at York University now folks this strike has been going on for four months it seems that you know at York University maybe they should hold placards when they're not on strike because it seems that they're on strike more than they're actually in the classroom I think after four months of collective bargaining and the fact that this is going to wipe out you know the the years the semesters for kids and it's causing all kinds of economic and scheduling hardship but anyways I think after four months when both sides can't come to an agreement you've got to go into the room and go either you're both wrong or you're both right doesn't matter we have to end this now so they want to bring in this back to work the legislation I think four months is more than enough time to have a kick at the can but well look who's screaming blue murder about this we have the Canadian union of public employees we have the Canadian Federation of students the Canadian Civil Liberties Union they're all urging mpps to support workers charter rights and you know not to not to have this back to work legislation you know it's really interesting isn't it folks the one that stands out here is the Canadian Federation of students now if you represented the needs and wants of students wouldn't you be all about having back to work legislation so the students who can't get the class can get the class but these cats are on the side of the progressive public sector employee unions well why is your name the Canadian Federation of students you don't care about the students you just care about a left-wing agenda and it's all about again public sector union entitlements and it's the credo there seems to be we are entitled to our entitlements you know it's funny I I have a was posted on the weekend folks a story on a Spanish civil servant it was found out that for more than a decade this guy was coming into work bright and early punching the clock and leaving at quitting time because it's government job that means 4 p.m. and had a pretty good attendance record except for one thing between going to work and quitting time he never did any work he just went out of the office and found a place to have a cafe or take a snooze so in between the fiestas and the siestas he did nothing but check in and check out well they finally caught on to him and only took over a decade and they fired him much to his misery but you know what they left the door open for him he can still reapply for his job after nine years because like I guess a lifetime ban would would just be too mean and rotten and cruel wouldn't it and so anyways we have okay so from Petra Heinrichs hi David from a journalistic point of view would you have rather been in Israel reporting oh I just lost I'll try to get that back folks because I do want to answer that and from Dave Kerr teaching is a dying profession ai expert said a couple weeks ago that teaching will be extinct as a professional within ten years high cost plus low income equals recipe for extinction I don't think so I you know I certainly what AI will be like in ten years will be fascinating but again I could see all the public sector unions banding together to having legislation written so that there would be no AI that would replace a living teacher in his or her job so there's a political thing too overcome David Kate Kyra right Spanish guy sounds like true that's funny and indeed you're right I mean then has there ever been a prime minister I mean I might be wrong but has there ever been a prime minister that has taken so many personal days off I mean he continually it seems needs to recover from a meeting and yet you have other heads of state who are much older like Donald Trump who are literally flying around the world zero downtime the schedule but Trudeau needs a personal day off or he needs to go to an island and relax on a beach yeah I think Trudeau would be well suited for that antiquities job that the spanish civil servant was fired for that's if it involves a lot of fiestas and siestas of course and oh we have a super chat being a fan of your segments would you ever consider doing an AMA well before I go in on that AMA stands for what exactly I want to find out what that Oh ask me anything that was our trained broadcast professional Justin in my ear yeah well you can ask me I think you are asking me anything and I'm trying to answer as honestly as I can so ask me anything but keep it family-friendly and okay from goatman true but Trudeau never worked a real job in his life well yeah he said he's a trust-fund kid and he got to where he is by having the right DNA essentially and oh boy are we paying for it and let's see Mark Jones Donald played golf all weekend in Scotland David well yeah that's true but you know isn't that a form of physical exercise at least I mean I'm not a golfer and and you know what I think when you isn't that sort of the customary thing to do for a head of state if you go to Scotland you got a do a round of golf I mean that's where golf was invented and it's not curling season so I'm gonna give the the president a pass on that and by the way how much golf did barack obama play during his term in office and let's see JB Duke says time to send Justin back to the drama class 2019 can't come quick enough well you know I won't give Justin this he must have scored an a-plus in drama class we have seen him apologize endlessly let's see - he's apologized to the LGBTQ community he's apologized to aboriginals a couple of times we have a whole highlight reel on rebel of him offering his apologies and it's not just apologies folks it's tearful apologies I mean I'm always amazed by any actor or actress out there who can cry on cue and Justin can do that and it's an amazing skill it really is not a good skill as a prime minister mind you but it is a good skill to have if you are an actor or a drama teacher so maybe that's his true calling and by the way as has been discussed in this space before you notice the teary-eyed apologies it's always for the sins of others it's not for what he's done such as oh I don't know groping a reporter 18 years ago in kokanee know that that's a teachable moment and time to move on and nothing to see here folks but when it comes to the systemic racism or homophobia or you name it of others he can turn on that those tears like the Niagara Falls so there you go Justin please should things you not go your way in the next election I think you would be an excellent drama teacher you've proved it time and time again how good you are and we have JB Duke apologizes and acting both start with the same letter that that's true it does and too legit to quit says bo played a lot of golf and still sucks at it well maybe I don't know what his scores are and from Petra Heinrichs Justin could easily become a Bollywood actor you know he could and it's funny you mention that Paula because it when he did that to me that's been the most disgraceful part of Justin's ongoing mr. dressup act is the fact that when he went to India he wore clothes that you would either see only in a Bollywood movie being filmed in India or at an Indian wedding I mean that's how formal you know and how ceremonial those clothes were I mean it would be like I don't know someone looking at a Canadian wedding and seeing the the groom and the bride and a tuxedo and a wedding dress and then going you know to go shopping at the Eaton Center in a tuxedo and a wedding dress I mean you'd you'd stand out like two big proverbial sore thumbs which he did and I wonder did did we ever find out what the cost of those costumes were cuz you know yeah there they are look at that holy smokes and the kids - oh I feel bad for those kids and Sophia I wonder what Sophie's praying for right there but you know yeah you don't if you're walking the streets of New Delhi on a typical day you're not seeing a whole heck of a lot of people dress up like that and let's just looking okay John Zealand writes even the UN knows Trudeau groper is an idiot well yeah but as I said in Israel they call the UN the United nothing's and that's what I'm going to be calling them so takes one to know when I guess and we have today yeah here's another one from Jim Jim a hick I I'm probably mispronouncing in there but it's about the cultural appropriations did you notice that folks in the left-wing mainstream media that on that India trip Justin and his family got a complete pass in terms of cultural appropriation I mean we have seen people condemned by the usual suspects for all manners of cultural appropriation hairstyles a wearing hoop earrings throwing a boomerang around you know this is all wrong and it's all about a culture being appropriated not appreciated why is it that Justin pulled that stunt and the same media outlets that especially around Halloween scream about cultural appropriation saw nothing there you know hypocrisy double standard yeah I think so and we have okay from John halfs the new recipe for successful military operations is to find a P up it moved too fast I'm sorry I'm very sorry about this folks I'm gonna have to get a little faster with my reading I suppose and I will try as the days go on by the way you have me for three more days this week I apologize in advance for those who miss Ezra and and let's see and we only have 190 watching now can we get that up but I you know the boss keeps track of these numbers and the money coming in from the for the super chat so if you can be so kind as to tune in and to donate that would put me in good standing with missile event and okay and we have from synth works oh wait here we have a another super chat let me get up to that sorry guys okay I'm having some technical difficulties of maybe one of our okay Joel GJ $5 thank you so much for that if Trudeau had cojones he would wear a lungi too bad he is exactly Steven Crowder's depiction we know what Joel can you send along what a lungi looks like but I'm almost betting that that would be cultural appropriation too but now here's something I want all of you to wear as you can see we have the Justin Trudeau grope t-shirt you see it says grope it's a take-off on that iconic Obama painting that says hope but because our guy has no hope and he does a lot of the grope or at least he did that's what we've gone with and it's a beautiful shirt I can't wait to wear mine proudly and you know it's gonna be interesting I wonder you know we have a rash of incidents in the US where people even kids wearing make America great again hats are getting verbally harassed and even physically assaulted just for their fashion choice in fact there was a few people a few days ago that an uber driver in Washington told them to get out of their car because they were they weren't even wearing their maggots who were just carrying them and once he saw them with those megawhatts he said sorry I I can't I can't complete this right I can't even begin it and they were booted out of the car I'm only bringing this up because again it shows the infantile level the left right now and how they personally take out their vendetta against people that don't conform to their freedom of speech their version of freedom of speech but but more to the point I wonder when people are wearing those grope t-shirts once they get into the pipeline and get into your mailboxes I just wonder what the reactions gonna be I'm wondering if people you know the true those supporters are even going to get it or you know they're even Indiana maybe they're gonna misconstrue grope as hope I don't know but like I said I can hardly wait to wear mine and it you have to admit it is a beautiful t-shirt and what a great idea if I do say so myself and we have from Tammy that Indian trip slash vacation was a complete disaster and he created I'm not sure if I've if the emails you know cut off but yeah it can even Trudeau supporters say that was a success especially when you're met at the airport by I believe it was the Deputy Minister of Agriculture I mean that's embarrassing that's humiliating you know the Deputy Minister of Agriculture and we know it was a disaster for so many other reasons other than costume choices - so let's see how we are going here and right see one of the issues I have folks when I'm reading some of these comments they seem to be comments made about other comments so I feel like I'm somebody walking into a theater with at the halfway mark of the movie and I'm not sure what so too legit to quit well I'm a GAD is just an invite to be attacked by the intolerant left progressives can't help themselves yeah and when did this become the new normal you know I mean I remember when Reagan was president from 1980 to 1988 Reagan was a polarizing president and the media were tough on rig and no question about it but nothing nothing compared to what we're seeing these days folks this is these are uncharted waters were in you know where you have media bias off the charts and you have people reacting violently to caps and t-shirts for goodness sakes it's it's a sorry state of civility to say the least and that's the miss little peg right streudel waves that no one at airports funny as hell I didn't know that maybe no one's waving at him and Tammy writes again David my grow t-shirt should be arriving any day ordered it last week well god bless you Tammy and I hope it gets there very quick I can hardly wait to see mine too and then I buy one for lady men Zoid to who I actually did grow up on the weekend but I'm allowed to because not just because I'm the husband but because oh geez alex is various it's it's his face it has ads by producer no Alex it's not because I'm her husband it's because it was consensual and she wanted to be groped that's the difference between my groping on the weekend of ladyman Zoid and what Justin Trudeau did 18 years ago and kokanee but to the point at hand what is the size when you were buying for a lady and I've been told that even no matter how large the person is never buy bigger than a medium even though if you know it's get you're gonna get it wrong even though it should be double XL never buy the double XL by the medium and then say then have her tell you oh you know sweetie it doesn't fit then send it back and get the appropriate size that will bring all kinds of harmony to a marriage and I can tell you alex is trying to hit hide his face but it's still buried in his hands I'm giving you this advice Alex for your lady friends in the future and to all you wonderful folks out there as well and let's see from a man to join perhaps you need a bigger monitor to see all the comments you know what what do you think guys can we get a bigger monitor for the days ahead it would help in a bigger font on the on the letters but thank you for that and some what David River says David you've got to see the video of Trudeau waving to no.1 funniest thing you will ever see please watch it or even bring it up now do we have that video guys is there some video out there of Trudeau waving to nobody because her our viewers seem to think that is a thing and and I'd love to see that video too and Tammy raise lady Manzo ed she must have the patience of a saint she does I mean she's put up with me for 27 years and why from st. Jean d'Arc why is this badly timed oh I think that's a comment about something else and from wake up rebel media oh brother just buy the correct size it shows you know her I'm a woman by the way yeah I'd still like to think I'm blissfully ignorant and by the way I gotta say this too when it comes to women's clothing you know sizes mean nothing I have found through bitter experience in trying to get the right size that one manufacturer size eight is another manufacturer size 12 is another sighs six so I don't think there is any kind of standardized sizing for women sizes in the fashion industry in fact I think it's a marketing gimmick I think they're all making the numbers smaller even though the garments are getting bigger just to make the person think she's buying a smaller size that's just my theory I might be wrong Lisa Leto says my son knows to only buy size small Wow your son loves you then what can I say and my team of trained broadcast professionals ladies and gentlemen tell me they have the waiving clip I would love to see that waiving clip here we go okay so it's true no walking to a very large airplane he's getting a salute he's waving and well I'm going to assume there was nobody there I didn't see anyone on the way to the plane so but who's to say there I don't know wasn't somebody maybe in air traffic trouble waving at him but there you go whatever he was off to - do you think that was business or was that a personal day off okay then and see to me so miss little peg I love buying huge t-shirts so I can use them as PJ's see that that that works in Tammy says he also ignores salute good point and you know that's not the first time he's ignored a salute he was I remember he was receiving a portrait once I believe and the police officer was saluting him and I think Trudeau leaned in for the hug for a teary-eyed something-or-other he just can't help himself and happy infidel Fox says he was waving at the seagull probably oh we have a super chat here then we get to it let's see a little Mart to try to call that up okay from Lisa Leto $10 thank you so much for generosity Lisa Trump Putin summit melted many snow flake reporters as well it should the thing is with regardless of where you stand on this Russia issue and I think the Democrats have a lot more to be fearful than the Republicans when it comes to collusion you can't ignore Russia I would classify Russia as neither an ally nor an enemy it's something sort of in between yet it's obviously a country you cannot ignore so this idea on the left that Trump shouldn't be meeting with Putin whatsoever especially with all these ongoing investigations and accusations going on it's ridiculous and how do you like that the chat just disappeared on me maybe one of my trained broadcast professionals can come in and try to fix this gizmo you see folks I'm from a day and age of typewriters and this never happened it was always hard copy and I'll never forget I had a journalism teacher the first day of school way back in 1981 and he said if you take away any lesson from this course this is what you should take away and it's this machines are out to screw you and you know what he's a hundred percent right and what he meant by that if you're going to go and tape record a very important interview bring extra batteries but bring two tape recorders always have at least two pens always you know pack an extra battery for your camera whatever it is because when you need it most machines are out to screw and then and that's why I can't read any more of your chance because it is just completely disappeared off the screen and I see we are in the homestretch of the battleground and so what can I tell you I Oh excellent we do have the Doug Ford clip and let's play that now well the only people getting hurt at York University and I've met numerous students are the students you know I believe in fair negotiation and I will always respect that but there's a time that we have to move forward but again over the next day or weeks we'll address that we're gonna look at all options and been in touch with some of the folks there and we're gonna lay everything on the table and try to get that ended as soon as possible because the only people again they're getting hurt here are the students and we want to put a quick end to this and there you have it folks I mean this strike you know let's let's be honest about this that this began in March I believe okay so we're now heading into August so if four months is not enough for the collective bargaining process well what is the correct amount of time is it six months eight months is it a year I mean did we go into September with this still lingering at some point like I said Wow ever you want to frame it you know what guys both of you are wrong you know what guys both of you are right it doesn't matter it has to end now enough is enough and it is about the kids and again I I doubt this back to one of the agitators screaming about the democratic process being violated here namely the Canadian Federation of students you guys are supposed to be standing up for students you know so the idea that you're in the same bed as the public sector unions makes me come up with a suggestion that maybe you want to change your name you're not really the Canadian Federation of students you're just a leftist puppet that is acting in the worst regard to the people that you are supposed to be representing and again I think this is more clarity coming out of Queens Park in just a a few weeks than we've had perhaps in 15 years of McGinty wind government there is so much damage to fix and you know it's I can't remember the last time there was a session sitting in summertime but it just speaks to how much damage has to be cleaned up and so far everything I've seen for du has been a hit right under the ballpark so good on him for doing this and also Doug don't back down to the the various unions and the Civil Liberties Union and the Federation of students nor they're useful idiots and the media even if you're to acquiesce to their demands they'll still hate you and they'll never thank you so do what's right do what you said you do and so far you are doing it and folks it is now 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time thank you so much for tuning in to bat battleground I'll look into this idea of getting a bigger monitor and a monitor that works for the next three days and have a wonderful day and remember without risk there can be no glory good afternoon you
