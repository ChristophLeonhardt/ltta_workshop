THEY SAID HE'S STILL AT IT.

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,858

15
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:48,770
OF COURSE THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,808
MANY PEOPLE GOT ON THE MULVANEY

HE SAID THIS IS SUPPOSE TO BE A

24
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:09,858
MULVANEY IS A DISGRACE.

25
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:11,293
INTERESTING, I AGREE.

26
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:13,795

00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:31,880
THAT WOULD BE SHAMELESSLY

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,247
DISHONEST.

59
00:02:44,386 --> 00:02:46,321

61
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:50,692

THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IN THE

65
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:56,531

YOU MIGHT SAY THOSE ARE HIS

83
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:42,477
STAFFERS.

84
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:44,613
HE'S NOT PART OF THE SWAMP.

85
00:03:44,613 --> 00:03:48,216
HE'S CLEAN AS A WHISTLE.

86
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:53,488
