AFTERMATH.
I HOPE THE HOUSE MAJORITY
DEMOCRATS.
>> Trish: JOINING ME IS SEAN
SPICER, NOW SENIOR ADVISER AND
THE SPOKESMAN FOR AMERICA
FIRST ACTION AND THE AUTHOR OF
THE NEW BOOK.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HAPPY FRIDAY.
>> Trish: IT SEEMS LIKE
DOING EVERYTHING HE COULD NOT
TO SAY YEAH, I'LL ENDORSE HER.
WE HEARD EXCUSES BUT WHAT IS
THE REAL REASON WHY SO MANY
DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING AWAY
FROM NANCY PELOSI RIGHT NOW?
>> LOOK, YOU ARE RIGHT.
THIS SHOULD BE A NO-BRAINER.
IF YOU ARE THE CHAIR OF THE
D.N.C. YOU SHOULD SAY I
TOTALLY SUPPORT NANCY PELOSI,
SHE HAS DONE ALL THE GREAT
STUFF AND I'M 100% CONFIDENT
THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL TAKE
OVER THE HOUSE.
HE DID NEITHER.
I THINK THAT WAS TELLING ON
BOTH COUNTS.
I THINK THAT SPEAKS TO THE
FACT THAT THE IDEA THAT NANCY
PELOSI FROM SAN FRANCISCO
ISN'T PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH FOR
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THEY
BELIEVE THE IDEAS ARE OLD,
TIRED, WORN OUT AND NOT THE
FUTURE OF THE PARTY SPEAKS
VOLUMES FOR WHAT TOM PEREZ
SEES FOR HIS OWN PARTY.
BUT I FOUND IT ILLUMINATING
WHEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY HE
SAYS HE HOPES THEY TAKE OVER
THE HOUSE.
IF YOU ARE THE CHAIR OF THE
D.N.C. OR THE CHAIR OF THE
R.N.C. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
OUT THERE EXPRESSING
UNBELIEVABLE CONFIDENCE IN
YOUR PARTY'S ABILITY TO WIN OR
MAINTAIN --
MAINTAIN MAJORITY.
HE DID NEITHER.
>> Trish: MAYBE HE IS NOT
GOOD AT HIS JOB.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS WHAT
YOU ARE SAYING THAT THEY THINK
SHE IS NOT THE FUTURE OF THE
PARTY.
I HAVE TO SAY, LIKE, THEY
MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING.
SHE TALKS ABOUT HOW $1,000 IS
CRUMBS, SHE MAY NOT HAVE THE
FUTURE OF THE PARTY.
>> THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY
HAVE GONE DOWN THE ROAD BEFORE
AND SHE HAS TAKEN THEM OUT OF
THE MAJORITY, MULTIPLE TIME.
THE SINGLE GREATEST GIFT THAT
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS RIGHT
NOW.
>> THEY'LL MISS HER.
>> I WON'T!
I'M A BIG FAN OF NANCY PELOSI
STAYING IN CONGRESS FOR YEARS
TO COME.
SHE IS A GREAT GIFT FOR US.
I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY
SYMBOLIC OF WHAT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY STANDS FOR.
ONCE WE EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE SHE
WOULD BE THE SPEAKER, WE MAKE
THAT RACE BINARY CHOICE.
AMERICA FIRST OUT THERE
RUNNING ADS AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND SUPPORTING CANDIDATES THAT
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY WILL
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
POLICIES AND AGENDA.
AND THAT IF WE LOSE THE
MAJORITY, IT'S NANCY PELOSI
AND ADAM SCHIFF AND MAXINE
WATERS WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE
OVER THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
THAT IS A VASTLY DIFFERENT
AGENDA THAN DONALD TRUMP AND
THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE
PASSING RIGHT NOW, THAT IS
BENEFITING SO MANY AMERICANS
FROM COAST TO COAST.
>> Trish: ISN'T THAT TRUE?
SO, HOW DOES KAVANAUGH AFFECT
ALL THIS?
HOW DOES KAVANAUGH AFFECT
MIDTERMS?
HOW DOES KAVANAUGH AFFECT THE
FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
AND THE FUTURE OF THIS
PRESIDENT?
>> INTERESTING QUESTION.
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT
BOTH SIDES HAVE DUG IN AND
THEY SEE THIS AS A POLARIZING
VIEW FOR THE SIDE.
ONE THAT IS GALVANIZING
SUPPORT FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.
THE INTERESTING THING THAT I
FIND FASCINATING IS FOR THE
FOLKS ON THE LEFT AND YOU SAW
NOT A SINGLE QUESTION IN THAT
CLIP ASKED OF TOM PEREZ.
THE DEPUTY CHAIR OF THE D.N.C.
ELLISON FROM MINNESOTA FACING
SIMILAR CHARGES AND ALL OF THE
FOLKS FROM THE DEMOCRATIC AND
THE LEFT SIDE HAVE YET TO
MENTION THE ALLEGATIONS THAT
ARE LEVELED AGAINST HIM AND
WHY HE IS STILL THE DEPUTY
CHAIR OF THE D.N.C.
THAT SHOULD BE ASKED OF EVERY
LEADERSHIP AND THE DEMOCRAT
AND RANK AND FILE.
IF THEY TAKE THIS SPECT TO
KAVANAUGH AND -- RESPECT TO
KAVANAUGH WHY ISN'T IT OKAY
FOR THEIR OWN?
>> Trish: FEMINISTS BACKED
BILL CLINTON WHEN HE TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF THE YOUNG WOMAN
WORKING AS THE INTERN.
THE DOUBLE STANDARD IN ALL OF
THIS CAN GET --
>> THAT IS ONE OF SEVERAL.
IN EVERY CASE THERE IS
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE.
IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE LEFT AND
THE POLITICALIZATION OF WHAT
THE LEFT IS DONE.
THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS
THAT NEED TO BE ASKED OF KEITH
ELLISON, THE DEPUTY CHAIR OF
D.N.C., BILL CLINTON AND
OTHERS ON THE LEFT WHO HAVE
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION AGAINST
THEM AS WELL.
IT'S FASCINATING I THINK TO
SEE HOW IT IS ONE-SIDED IN THE
CHARGES.
>> Trish: SURE.
POLITICS AS USUAL.
ALL RIGHT.
>> WOMEN NEED TO BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY AND CREDIBLY.
