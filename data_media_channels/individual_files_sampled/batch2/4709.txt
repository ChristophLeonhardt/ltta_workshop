whether rupert murdoch's wall street journal' will have anybody talking to the president The Wall Street Journal's editorial board writes today quote every sentient voter in 2016 understood that Donald Trump had a bad history with women but mistakes of character tend to catch up with everyone and that's what is now happening with President Trump and his many women mr. Trump can't retain the best legal counsel because no one wants a client who ignores all advice he wants to answer questions from mr. Muller but probably won't prepare enough to avoid even accidental self-incrimination the stormy Daniels case is typical of mr. Trump's pre presidential behavior in thinking he can with enough threats and assembling get away with anything he's never understood that a president can't behave that way and this may be the cause of his downfall Susan this is just among the first cracks in terms of support editorial support for the president from the journal and that's exactly right when you talk about the faults of his character coming back to haunt him that not only plays to the president but it also replaced to a lot of Republicans in the House and the Senate right now who should be saying I will stand up for what's right I will speak against the president and what's he's doing is whether it's his policies or even some of the things the attacks he makes on women and other people but the stormy Daniels thing is just something that hits so hits him so differently yeah and I'm not you know we know he hasn't tweeted about it he hasn't gone anywhere but I think it's just a matter of time and that's what I think a lot of people are waiting for you know Eddie there's a piece in The New York Times today by Jonathan Martin about various Republicans running around the country and they cannot they can't stand up and talk about real issues that affect people because the first question out of the box is the president's behavior right I mean it seems to me that this Teflon knot is no longer Teflon Don when it comes to to the stormy Daniels question I think there are three seas here there's the case there's the client and there's the climate I don't think any lawyer in their right mind wants to take on the case I don't even think any lawyer who his or her salt wants to deal with the client that will not pay attention that will not lie that will not follow advice that will not pay and then there's the climate the climate is not only the me2 movement the me2 movement has changed the way in which people understand and accept certain kinds of behavior with how they judge that behavior there's the climate in terms of the the serious I think response to Russian interference in our elections there's kind of economic uncertainty there's the chaos that's coming out of the White House so all of this that that that I think informs how people are judging and assessing what's going on I think it's also shaping and informing how lawyers are assessing where that I think will take on this case yeah I mean and speaking of the Republicans and that Jonathan Martin article and stormy Daniels let's go to the latest in the stormy Daniels story the porn stars now suing Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen for defamation claiming that he betrayed her is a liar when denying claims of her affair with Donald Trump the new filing also argued that the $130,000 hush-money agreement signed just 11 days before the election should be nullified because it violated campaign finance law meanwhile the White House is trying to explain why the president has not responded to the porn star directly yesterday the more in the morning after her 60 minutes interview aired the president tweeted quote so much fake news never been more of a lot of voluminous or inaccurate but through it all our country is doing great a senior administration official tells NBC News that the president has discussed his response with several aides and has been told that the stormy Daniels issue doesn't rise to the level of a presidential response the senior official also counseled Trump telling him that it doesn't endanger his presidency or agenda here's the White House yesterday categorically that the president is campaign and the Trump Organization did not violate the law still the election law regarding that payment well I can speak for only the White House and I can say categorically obviously White House didn't engage in any any wrongdoing the campaign or mr. Cohen the yeah the campaign or mr. Cohen can address anything with respect to their actions with respect to that interview I will say the president strongly clearly and has consistently denied these underlying claims and the only person who's been inconsistent is the one making the claims was the president aware of a physical threat made against well the president doesn't believe that any of the claims that miss Daniels made last night in the interview are accurate she was no he does not sorry what's his face well he just doesn't believe that you know there's nothing to corroborate her claim alright we've also learned that 22 million people watch 60 minutes Sunday the porn star interview was actually the news magazines highest-rated episode in a decade second only to Barack and Michelle Obama's sit down in 2008 beating Donald Trump's 2016 interview and any interview Donald Trump has ever had on 60 minutes stormy Daniels lawyer did some trolling though tweeting quote since this is really what matters lol the ratings from my clients or McDaniels appearance in 60 minutes last night crushed by millions Andy Apprentice show in the last 10 years as well as mr. Trump's November 2016 appearance hash tag priorities we will leave that there meanwhile Republican lawmakers are finding it increasingly tough to escape Donald Trump's shadow with many facing the grim future of a midterm that's going to be a referendum on the president's personal conduct and behavior quote I don't see headlines with porn stars whose Nancy Pelosi said Democratic congressman Cedric Richmond and Pennsylvania Republican Ryan Costello and discussing his decision not to seek reelection to the house said the president was getting in the way of the gops message we're talking about porn stars and the president rather than about tax policy or what we need to get done by the end of the year or what should have been in the omnibus it's very difficult for me to get that message out because we're talking about story daniels or it was McCabe before that it was Rex Tillerson and where he heard the news that he was fired and just one thing after another it is it is deeply frustrating I will I will certainly say that Jon Meacham that's Ryan Costello a rising star in Pennsylvania politics he was expected to go places in the house now he's going home and we find in the article this New York Times article talks about the catch-22 that we've been discussing for the past year and that is Republicans have to act a certain way to get past the primary process are they believe they do I think they're badly mistaken but they think they have to bow and scrape to Donald Trump and apologize to Donald Trump to get through that primary process but if you do that in a Nevada Senatorial primary or in an Arizona Senatorial primary as the article explains you make yourself radioactive in the general election and you lose as congressman Costello ever said who he voted for for president in 2016 I mean is is he surprised by this is this a you know it's a claw drain it mixed Claude Rains look like a documentary I mean of course this candidate is getting in the way of an agenda I mean what what what planet are they on this is the world we've all been living in since since the escalator is is the same one and so to suddenly discover like Miranda in the tempest that oh brave new world Donald Trump is a distraction from the issues of substance facing America good god well sorry yeah just I'm just such a lifer gasps that says suddenly a Republican would discover that maybe this unconventional president is it really great for an underlying concern movement conservative agenda huh yeah well in John and and maybe if they've been speaking out against the worst his worst instincts his worst character traits from the very beginning as I've been saying maybe he would have checked those at the gate when he went into the White House if he thought he ever was going to have to pay any consequences from the Republican Party but they have bowed and they have scraped and they have been scared to death and let's just start at the very top with Paul Ryan who said yes he's a racist yes what he said was the epitome of a racist statement and yes I'm going to endorse him when that is where the party leader starts and that is where the party starts it's obvious this is where we're going to end up yeah where you want to be in this just look at just to be a total self parity here historically you'll want to be Margaret chase Smith the senator from Maine who in 1950 said that Joe McCarthy was violating fundamental American principles you don't want to be the guys in 54 who just caught up with the idea that maybe things weren't so great with red-baiting and so one of the tragedies of the last era and we have used this line before but this is one of the few cases of when Trump won the nomination of a hijacker boarding a plane and the passengers sided with the hijacker okay but it's all you know the fun's over you know we're now sort of commending him in this bizarre moment for not tweeting about about a porn star and so I just think I just think I the profiles encourage would after the after the fires come down I think is a bit much and Joe just to go to your point about speaker Ryan well last week in March and he has not announced that he's seeking re-election yet as a matter of fact there's some rumors going around that he may step down but when it comes to people that he's trying to get to run for office how can he possibly influence them when he's not willing to say he's himself is running willing to run for re-election and that's starting to filter all the way down into the local races and and you know Richard you either we're talking about John meets him and I were talking about how we've said that it's the first time that a hijacker took over a plane talking about Trump taking over the Republican Party and everybody in the plane cheered on the hijackers well guess what we've now gotten to a point where that plane is either going to crash our Republicans are going to figure out a way to land the plane and continuing to let the hijacker take control of the cockpit all right this I understand people gonna say oh you have to do it we have to do it we know you don't you really don't we're an Newt Gingrich out of town when he stopped representing conservative principles I'm not saying they have to run Donald Trump out of town but they can tell him though I mean they're the thing that bothers me Richard is we're on Sesame Street today's number is two if only two Republican senators stood up there you go and two Republican senators went to Donald Trump and said I understand you don't have any discipline I understand that nobody has ever held you to account well that's fine you do what you want to do but we're just here to tell you like Barry Goldwater told Richard Nixon the 1974 it's over you either begin behaving in a respectable responsible way or you lose our two votes and you no longer have a majority of the United States Senate now I can think of two senators that were retiring and I really wonder what bob corker and Jeff like want their legacy to be but we really don't need their floor speeches we really don't need their tweets we need them to step up and protect the Republic but there seems to be absolutely no courage among Republicans here no you're right and I was going to mention the same two senators I don't see a lot that they've got to lose so it'd be an easy profile encourage for them to stand up my guess is though more broadly Joe particularly in the house you wouldn't again you'd know this better than I would but my hunch is people are gonna have to go through November and only after November and assuming these trends hold that it's a debacle for Republicans and a lot of it's attributed to the president that then some people in the Republican Party may say hey if this party has any future we've got to wrestle it back and we've got to find out what it is we we stand for and have some return to our roots but I would be really surprised if that were to happen after what the last 1415 months ahead of that kind of a political awakening or whatever you want to call it debacle so my guess is other than the odds statement I kind of think what we're seeing is what we're going to get as distressing and as depressing as it's going to be and by the way what you know we'll talk about a later expect it's not as though the world is going on pause while we're doing this you have all these things coming at the United States some rant to North Korea to trade you name it and where's the Senate where's the house where are the hearings where is Congress standing up not just about the president's personal behavior how about about its policy where are people holding up a mirror and saying are we comfortable with where this president and this administration are steering the ship of state do we agree with these things this is consequential so I want them not just a basically questioning his character as important as that is I want somebody to start questioning his policies yeah and there is no consistency there is no courage one day they stand up to in the next they go golfing with him the next he's their best friend there does seem to be absolutely no no consistency hey Eddie really quickly before we go to break the woman who inspired her actually at the time the young girl who inspired action which actually led eventually to the end of segregation in the United States passed away yesterday talk about the young girl who who looked up at those steps in Little Rock Arkansas 70 years ago and said they were big steps and my feet were so small my legs were so small but she walked up those stairs anyway and changed history yeah Linda Brown is one of those ordinary heroes that fundamentally transformed the country here we have a family in Topeka who just simply did not want their child to walk so far away in order to go to school at the the white school right down the street she really desperately wanted to attend and they would not admit her because she was an african-american and they joined the case with the n-double-a-cp and the leadership of Thurgood Marshall and they fundamentally transformed the country and we need to talk about these young children these young people Little Rock Nine you think about the students it ends these are young folk who fundamentally put their lives on the line and challenged hatred faced fate front challenged hate front on and as a result the nation is different but we have to then as we celebrate our life acknowledge the fact that the country's schools remain as segregated today as they were in the 1960s we still have a lot of fight to do you know Joe a lot of fight it gets to you know one small step climbing the schoolroom steps a young girl exhibits courage and we are now part of an age where United States senators don't have the courage to stand up to the President of the United States well and that's one of the reasons why I talked about that quote think about the courage in Kansas think about the courage in Little Rock the courage at Ole Miss in Oxford Mississippi in Tuscaloosa Alabama so many students being courageous so long ago and actually changing the world that we lived in now it's hard to even find a couple of senators who will stand up to the constitutional right that is that is occurring in Washington DC we just we just need some profiles and courage like that still ahead on Morning Joe the United States joins its allies in sending a clear message to Moscow but will the of diplomats be enough to curb the Kremlin we're gonna be talking to Richard Haass about that when we come back plus we already knew that Jared Kushner was being investigated we just didn't know it was the White House who was investigating him what's behind yet another layer of scrutiny for the presidential adviser and speaking of Donald Trump's inner circle the president is reportedly helping to bring back Rob Porter yes the same Rob Porter who was fired last month last month amid allegations of abusing two of his wife's thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you
