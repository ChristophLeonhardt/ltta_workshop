1
00:00:10,029 --> 00:00:11,564
>> Maria: WELCOME BACK.

2
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:12,632
VALORIE JARRETT IS SPEAKING OUT

3
00:00:12,632 --> 00:00:14,133
ON WHAT ROSEANNE TWEETED OUT.

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,668
SHE SAID THAT ROSEANNE IS NOT

5
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:17,637
THE ONLY ONE THAT DESERVES THE

6
00:00:17,637 --> 00:00:17,937
BLAME.

7
00:00:17,937 --> 00:00:20,339
TAKE A LISTEN.

8
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:22,074
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS

9
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:23,809
PRESIDENT HAS SET A TONE THAT

10
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:25,544
HAS MADE PEOPLE FEEL

11
00:00:25,544 --> 00:00:26,679
INCREASINGLY EMPOWERED TO SAY

12
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:27,613
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS?

13
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:30,149
>> THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,917
I THINK TONE DOES START AT TOP

15
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:34,453
AND WE LIKE TO LOOK UP TO OUR

16
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:35,855
PRESIDENT AND FEEL HE REFLECTS

17
00:00:35,855 --> 00:00:37,556
THE VALUES OF OUR COUNTRY.

18
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:39,992
EVERY INDIVIDUAL CITIZEN HAS THE

19
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:41,093
RESPONSIBILITY, TOO.

20
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:42,962
>> Maria: SHE SAID SOME OF IT

21
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:45,464
COMES FROM THE TOP, INCLUDING

22
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:45,965
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

23
00:00:45,965 --> 00:00:47,667
WHAT DO SOCIAL MEDIA STARS

24
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:49,335
DIAMOND AND SILK THINK ABOUT

25
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:49,635
THAT?

26
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:50,336
YOU HEARD VALORIE JARRETT.

27
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:51,137
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:54,273
>> OF COURSE, I DON'T AGREE WITH

29
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:56,809
WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT BLAMING OUR

30
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:58,044
PRESIDENT FOR WHAT SOMEONE

31
00:00:58,044 --> 00:00:58,711
TREATED.

32
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:01,213
FIRST OF ALL, ROSEANNE, SHE'S

33
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,715
NOT A RACIST.

34
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,283
SHE MADE BAD JUDGMENT WHEN SHE

35
00:01:04,283 --> 00:01:05,785
TWEETED OUT SOMETHING THAT WAS A

36
00:01:05,785 --> 00:01:07,086
LITTLE OFF-THE-CUFF.

37
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,521
SHE APOLOGIZED FOR IT.

38
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:10,389
WHERE IS THE APOLOGY FROM ALL OF

39
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,659
THE OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THE JOY

40
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:15,761
BEHAR, WHOOPI GOLDBERG, JIMMY

41
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:16,095
KIMMEL?

42
00:01:16,095 --> 00:01:17,430
WHERE ARE THE APOLOGIES FROM

43
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,131
THOSE PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR ABC

44
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:19,932
AS WELL?

45
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:21,867
YOU KNOW, WHY HAVEN'T THEIR

46
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:22,468
SHOWED BEEN CANNED?

47
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:24,470
THEY SAID SOME OFF-THE-CUFF

48
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,538
STUFF ABOUT OUR PRESIDENT.

49
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:26,772
ABOUT CONSERVATIVES.

50
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,775
ABOUT PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT OUR

51
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:30,676
PRESIDENT.

52
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,211
>> Maria: I WAS READING THE

53
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:36,215
KEITH OBERHMAN TWEETS.

54
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:38,150
I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE THINGS HE

55
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,419
SAID WITH THE F BOMBS AND THE

56
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:42,722
PUSH-BACK ON PRESIDENT TRUMP.

57
00:01:42,722 --> 00:01:45,891
YOU HEARD HOWIE KURTZ MENTION

58
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:46,659

59
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:48,027
>> WE HAD TO BLOCK KEITH ON

60
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:49,462
TWITTER BECAUSE HE'S SO NASTY.

61
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:52,131
>> VERY NASTY.

62
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:55,234
>> I DON'T GET THE HYPOCRISY.

63
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:56,936
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THE

64
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:57,369
CONVERSATION.

65
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,771
I KNOW VALORIE SAID THIS IS A

66
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,472
TEACHABLE MOMENT.

67
00:01:59,472 --> 00:02:01,841
IF THIS IS A TEACHABLE MOMENT,

68
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:05,144
HOW ABOUT WE OPEN UP -- OPEN IT

69
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:05,411
UP.

70
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:07,079
TALK ABOUT RACISM, TALK ABOUT IT

71
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,913
ON ONE SIDE.

72
00:02:07,913 --> 00:02:10,583
THE WORD "MONKEY", BLACK PEOPLE

73
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:11,250
CALL US THAT.

74
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,085
>> WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT ON

75
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:13,486
BOTH SIDES.

76
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:15,187
>> THIS IS NOT ONE-SIDED.

77
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:16,655
IT'S NOT ONE SIDED.

78
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:17,490
IT'S BOTH SIDES.

79
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,625
WE'RE CALLED MONKEYS, COONS, ALL

80
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,994
KINDS OF DEROGATORY NAMES.

81
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:23,362
YOU TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO TREAT

82
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:23,629
YOU.

83
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:25,331
EVERYBODY WANT TO BE MAD AT

84
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:28,467
ROSEANNE WHO HAPPENS TO BE A

85
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:28,868
WHITE WOMAN.

86
00:02:28,868 --> 00:02:30,469
YOU CALL HER RACISM.

87
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:31,470
WHAT ABOUT OUR BLACK BROTHERS

88
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,708
AND SISTERS CALLING OTHERS ALL

89
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,510
KINDS OF DEROGATORY NAMES.

90
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,278
LET'S TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE

91
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:40,913
WHOLE CONVERSATION AND NOT JUST

92
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:41,847
BE ONE SIDED.

93
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,582
>> Maria: SO WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT

94
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:43,849
IT?

95
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,519
>> STOP CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES

96
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:48,320
AND COME TO THE TABLE AND TALK

97
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:48,854
ABOUT IT.

98
00:02:48,854 --> 00:02:51,857
I DON'T THINK HER SHOW SHOULD

99
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,126
HAVE BEEN A TEACHABLE MOMENT.

100
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:55,694
LET THIS PLAY OUT ON THE SHOW SO

101
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:57,429
WE KNOW HOW TO TREAT EACH OTHER.

102
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:58,564
>> Maria: FEELS LIKE IF YOU'RE A

103
00:02:58,564 --> 00:03:01,233
TRUMP SUPPORTER, THERE'S NO ROOM

104
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:02,168
FOR ERROR.

105
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:04,003
SHE OBVIOUSLY MADE A BIG

106
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:04,370
MISTAKE.

107
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,071
>> AND SHE APOLOGIZED.

108
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,540
>> Maria: THERE'S NO ROOM FOR

109
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,608
AIRFER YOU HAVE A CONSERVATIVE

110
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:10,009
MENTALITY.

111
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:10,810
>> THAT'S NOT FAIR.

112
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,077
THAT'S WHAT THE HYPOCRISY COMES

113
00:03:12,077 --> 00:03:12,378
IN.

114
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:13,612
THAT'S -- IT'S GOT TO STOP.

115
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:15,581
>> SHE'S APOLOGIZED FOR IT.

116
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,615
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE THING.

117
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:18,050
SHE WAS WOMAN ENOUGH TO

118
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,751
APOLOGIZE IT.

119
00:03:18,751 --> 00:03:20,553
WHEN SHE SAW THE JOKE FELL FLAT,

120
00:03:20,553 --> 00:03:23,022
SHE APOLOGIZED FOR IT.

121
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,057
WE STILL HAVE YET TO WAIT ON

122
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:27,226
OTHER PEOPLE FROM THE LEFT.

123
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:31,530
WITH WERE ASTOUNDED -- THEY'RE

124
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,499
BEATING THIS LADY UP ABOUT

125
00:03:33,499 --> 00:03:35,134
RACISM WHEN THEY'RE THE ONES

126
00:03:35,134 --> 00:03:36,902
THAT DOES THE RACISM.

127
00:03:36,902 --> 00:03:39,505
YOU'LL SEE SO MANY DEROGATORY

128
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,173
REMARKS MADE ABOUT US FROM OTHER

129
00:03:41,173 --> 00:03:42,842
BLACK PEOPLE SPEAKING OUT,

130
00:03:42,842 --> 00:03:45,044
TALKING ABOUT THIS PERSON IS

131
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:45,444
RACIST.

132
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:48,214
ONE TWEET DON'T MAKE YOU A

133
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:48,547
RACIST.

134
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:50,149
>> Maria: SO WAS IT APPROPRIATE?

135
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:51,217
WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WITH

136
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:52,017
ROSEANNE NOW?

137
00:03:52,017 --> 00:03:53,586
WAS IT APPROPRIATE THAT THE SHOW

138
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:55,154
WAS CANCELLED AND DO YOU THINK

139
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:56,822
IT GETS PICKED UP BY SOMEBODY

140
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:57,122
ELSE?

141
00:03:57,122 --> 00:03:59,491
THE SHOW IS INCREDIBLY

142
00:03:59,491 --> 00:03:59,892
SUCCESSFUL.

143
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,460
>> A VERY SUCCESSFUL SHOW.

144
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,229
I HOPE IT GETS PICKED UP BY

145
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:04,263
SOMEBODY ELSE IF ABC DOESN'T

146
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:05,664
WANT TO DEAL WITH IT.

147
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:08,667
LISTEN, I THINK EVERYBODY

148
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,736
DESERVES TO BE FORGIVEN.

149
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:12,371
>> YOU CANCEL HER SHOW, THERE'S

150
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,874
MORE SHOWS THAT NEED TO BE

151
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:15,274
CANCELLED.

152
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:18,911
WE CAN CANCEL "THE VIEW" AND

153
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,579
JIMMY KIMMEL.

154
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,314
THEY SAY DEROGATORY THINGS.

155
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:24,750
YOU WANT TIT FOR TAT --

156
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,585
>> THAT'S A POINT.

157
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:28,220
JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS I'M A

158
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:28,587
COMEDIAN.

159
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:29,855
>> SHE'S A COMEDIAN, TOO.

160
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,323
>> SHE WASN'T MAKING A JOKE --

161
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:32,725
>> SHE SAID SHE WAS MAKING A

162
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:33,025
JOKE.

163
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:34,426
I WANT TO GIVE HER THE BENEFIT

164
00:04:34,426 --> 00:04:35,127
OF THE DOUBT.

165
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:35,594
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

166
00:04:35,594 --> 00:04:37,162
SHE WAS MAKING A JOKE.

167
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:40,499
SHE APOLOGIZED FOR IT, A

168
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:41,700
COMEDIAN JUST CALLED US BOOT

169
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,638
LIQUORS AND COONS.

170
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:48,340
WE TOLD HIM TO TAKE IT DOWN.

171
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:48,874
HE DID.

172
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:49,441
IT HAPPENS.

173
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,476
>> Maria: YOU HAD YOUR

174
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:52,044
CHALLENGES WITH TWITTER IN

175
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:52,378
ITSELF.

176
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:54,813
>> ABSOLUTELY.

177
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,616
TWITTER.

178
00:04:57,616 --> 00:04:57,883
YES.

179
00:04:57,883 --> 00:04:59,652
>> YOU THINK THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR

180
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:00,085
CONSERVATIVES?

181
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,420
>> AND WE SUPPORT THIS

PRESIDENT.

183

YOU HAVE TO REALIZE HOW HE WON

184
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:05,357
THIS, THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA.

185
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:06,592
WE USED SOCIAL MEDIA.

186
00:05:06,592 --> 00:05:07,860
NOW HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE

187
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,327
UNITED STATES.

188
00:05:08,327 --> 00:05:08,894
THEY DON'T LIKE THAT.

189
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,229
THEY'RE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING

190
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,264
THEY CAN TO BLOCK US AND STOP

191
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:12,531
US.

192
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:15,601
>> AND LOOK AT US AS A DOUBLE

193
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:15,935
THREAT.

194
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:19,605
WE'RE TWO BLACK WOMEN, WE LOVE

195
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:20,639
OUR PRESIDENT.

196
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,974
WE'RE A TRIPLE THREAT.

197
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:23,075
>> Maria: IN TERMS OF SOCIAL

198
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,643
MEDIA, PEOPLE ARE MOVING SO

199
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:24,944
FAST.

200
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,178
THEY SAY THINGS LIKE THIS.

201
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:29,982
YOU KNOW, I HAVE SEEN IT MYSELF.

202
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:32,151
YOU SAY THINGS AND IT'S OH GOSH,

203
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:33,585
WHY DID I SAY THAT?

204
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:34,787
WE SHOULD HAVE MORE FORGIVENESS

205
00:05:34,787 --> 00:05:35,454
FOR THAT.

206
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,656
HAVING SAID THAT, THERE'S NO

207
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:38,557
ROOM.

208
00:05:38,557 --> 00:05:39,925
THERE'S NO TOLERANCE FOR RACIST.

209
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:41,360
>> THERE'S NO TOLERANCE FOR

210
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,660
THAT.

211
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,165
ANY KIND OF RACISM ON EITHER

212
00:05:46,165 --> 00:05:46,465
SIDE.

213
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:48,100
WE CAN'T ALWAYS POINT THE FINGER

214
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,436
AT EVERY WHITE PERSON WHEN MY

215
00:05:50,436 --> 00:05:53,639
BLACK BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE

216
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,774
CALLING US OUT.

217
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:58,477
BEN CARSON WAS JUST CALLED A

218
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:00,245
PORCH MONKEY NOBODY SAID NOTHING

219
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,814
ABOUT THAT JOURNALIST.

220
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:05,451
EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO OFF ON

221
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:05,818
ROSEANNE.

222
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:07,186
>> Maria: A JOURNALIST CALLED

223
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,554

224
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:09,655
>> YES.

225
00:06:09,655 --> 00:06:11,156
>> DIDN'T APOLOGIZE.

226
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:11,690
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

227
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,692
>> CAN'T BE A DOUBLE STANDARD.

228
00:06:13,692 --> 00:06:15,260
RACISM IS NOT JUST ABOUT WHITE.

229
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,363
IF YOU ARE SPEWING UP, THEN YOU

230
00:06:17,363 --> 00:06:18,731
NEED TO STOP DOING IT.

231
00:06:18,731 --> 00:06:19,999
>> Maria: IT'S IGNORANCE ACROSS

232
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:20,632
THE BOARD.

233
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,534
>> ABSOLUTELY.

234
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,669
>> Maria: COMES IN MANY FORMS.

235
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:24,703
>> ABSOLUTELY.

236
00:06:24,703 --> 00:06:25,971
>> Maria: SO HAVE YOU HEARD FROM

237
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:26,338
ROSEANNE?

238
00:06:26,338 --> 00:06:27,473
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HER

239
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:27,840
RESPONSE?

240
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,244
>> LISTEN, IF IT WAS ME, I WOULD

241
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:33,746
GET OFF AND GIVE IT A BREAK.

242
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:36,048
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON THE

243
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,916
DEFENSE ABOUT EVERYTHING.

244
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,718
>> Maria: THE PRESIDENT

245
00:06:39,718 --> 00:06:44,556
RESPONDING, JUST TALK TO HOWIE

246
00:06:44,556 --> 00:06:46,025
KURTZ ABOUT THIS IS GIVING MORE

247
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:47,159
PEOPLE AMMUNITION TO ATTACK

248
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,760
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

249
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,527
YOU KNOW THAT.

250
00:06:48,527 --> 00:06:50,262
>> HERE'S THE DEAL.

251
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:51,797
HE MADE PERFECT SENSE WHEN HE

252
00:06:51,797 --> 00:06:52,564
SAID IT.

253
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,767
ALL OF THESE PEOPLE OF ABC

254
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:55,401
ATTACKS HIM.

255
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,369
THAT PRODUCER, WHOEVER THAT WAS,

256
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:59,171
THEY DIDN'T SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

257
00:06:59,171 --> 00:06:59,738
MR. PRESIDENT?

258
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:00,572
WE ARE SORRY.

259
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:02,541
WE APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT.

260
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,142
THE HYPOCRISY.

261
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,978
IT CANNOT BE ONE SIDED AND IT'S

262
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:06,345
ONE-SIDED.

263
00:07:06,345 --> 00:07:07,279
I'M HAPPY THAT THE PRESIDENT

264
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,881
WEIGHED IN THE WAY HE WEIGHED

265
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:09,415
IN.

266
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:10,382
>> Maria: BUT THE PRESIDENT IS

267
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,885
NOT AFRAID TO SAY, YOU KNOW,

268
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:13,986
LYING TED OR --

269
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:17,222
>> THAT WAS DURING A PRIMARY.

270
00:07:17,222 --> 00:07:19,258
>> CHUCK TODD, SLEEPY EYES.

271
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:21,660
HE'S NOT AFRAID TO THROW IT.

272
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,796
>> THESE PEOPLE HAVE THROWN IT

273
00:07:23,796 --> 00:07:25,264
TO HIM.

274
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:26,098
>> Maria: THAT'S TRUE.

275
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:27,466
>> THEY HAVE SAID THE MOST

276
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:30,469
DAMNED THINGS.

277
00:07:30,602 --> 00:07:31,003
PRESIDENT.

278
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:34,273
IMAGINE IF HE DID THAT TO OBAMA.

279
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:35,340
EVERYTHING WOULD HAVE BROKE

280
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,641
LOOSE.

281
00:07:35,641 --> 00:07:37,376
>> AND THE CRAZY THING, THEY DO

282
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:39,711
IT DAILY.

283
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,347
ROSEANNE I SHOW CAME ON ONCE A

284
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:42,748
WEEK.

285
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:46,585
THEY DO IT DAILY AND NO APOLOGY.

286
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:51,790
THEY CALL HIM A HOMOPHOBE,

287
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,157
XENOPHOBE.

288
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:54,626
THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM SAYING

289
00:07:54,626 --> 00:07:57,396
HE'S A RACIST.

290
00:07:57,396 --> 00:07:59,531
DONALD TRUMP, OUR PRESIDENT IS

291
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,899
NOT A RACISTIC AND THE ONLY

292
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,468
COLOR HE SEE IS GREEN AND HE

293
00:08:02,468 --> 00:08:03,635
WANTS EVERYBODY TO HAVE SOME.

294
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:06,105
>> HE'S WANTS US TO BE

295
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:06,505
PROSPEROUS.

296
00:08:06,505 --> 00:08:07,239
>> Maria: BY THE WAY, IT'S

297
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:07,606
HAPPENING.

298
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:08,640
THE ECONOMY IS GROWING.

299
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,043
LET ME ASK YOU, BECAUSE OF YOUR

300
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:14,012
CONSERVATIVE VIEWS, YOU'RE LIKE

301
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,681
OUT THERE AND YOU'RE UP FOR

302
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:16,014
ATTACK.

303
00:08:16,014 --> 00:08:16,615
I'VE WATCHED THIS.

304
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,150
HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN

305
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,584
CONSERVATIVE?

306
00:08:18,584 --> 00:08:19,551
>> WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN

307
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:21,086
CONSERVATIVES IN OUR THOUGHT AND

308
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:22,187
THINKING PROCESS.

309
00:08:22,187 --> 00:08:23,956
WE TENDED TO VOTE DEMOCRAT

310
00:08:23,956 --> 00:08:25,257
BECAUSE WE WERE CONDITIONED.

311
00:08:25,257 --> 00:08:26,658
WE FOUND THAT JUST BECAUSE

312
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:27,793
YOU'RE BLACK DIDN'T MEAN YOU

313
00:08:27,793 --> 00:08:28,727
HAVE TO VOTE DEMOCRAT.

314
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:32,164
WE SAY YOU CAN GET OFF OF THAT,

315
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,999
THE DEMOCRAT PLANTATION AND VOTE

316
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,100
FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

317
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,602
WHEN WE SAW DONALD TRUMP NOW

318
00:08:36,602 --> 00:08:37,836
PRESIDENT TRUMP, WE WANTED

319
00:08:37,836 --> 00:08:38,837
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THAT'S

320
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,105
WHY WE VOTED FOR HIM.

321
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,874
>> Maria: REALLY INTERESTING.

322
00:08:41,874 --> 00:08:47,779
SO YOU SORT OF WENT WITH THE

323
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:48,080
HERD.

324
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,181
>> CONDITIONED.

325
00:08:49,181 --> 00:08:50,449
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

326
00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:51,917
WE WERE LIFE-LONG DEMOCRATS.

327
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:54,119
BEING LIFE-LONG DEMOCRATS, THEY

328
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,821
TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO VOTE

329
00:08:55,821 --> 00:08:56,188
DEMOCRAT.

330
00:08:56,188 --> 00:08:57,923
WHOEVER THE HEAD OF THE TICKET

331
00:08:57,923 --> 00:08:59,591
IS, THAT'S WHO YOU VOTE FOR.

332
00:08:59,591 --> 00:09:00,759
>> Maria: EVEN IF YOUR LIFE

333
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:02,194
HASN'T CHANGED, IF YOU WEREN'T

334
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:04,296
LIKING THE POLICIES, IF THE

335
00:09:04,296 --> 00:09:06,031
POLICIES WERE WORKING AGAINST

336
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:06,298
YOU.

337
00:09:06,298 --> 00:09:07,933
>> THEY SAY STUFF LIKE YOU MAY

338
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:09,268
NOT BE ABLE TO EAT UNDER A

339
00:09:09,268 --> 00:09:09,668
REPUBLICAN.

340
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,803
THAT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO

341
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:14,006
THE JIM CROW DAYS CREATED BY THE

342
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:14,406
DEMOCRATS.

343
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:15,874
YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR HISTORY.

344
00:09:15,874 --> 00:09:17,576
WHEN WE DID OUR HISTORY ABOUT

345
00:09:17,576 --> 00:09:19,178
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, IT WAS

346
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:20,612
TIME TO DITCH THEM.

347
00:09:20,612 --> 00:09:22,080
THAT'S WHY WE STARTED THE DITCH

348
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,282
AND SWITCH MOVEMENT IN SEPTEMBER

349
00:09:23,282 --> 00:09:24,750
OF 2015 BECAUSE WE WANT

350
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,951
EVERYBODY TO SWITCH TO

351
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,119
REPUBLICAN TO VOTE FOR DONALD

352
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:27,452
TRUMP.

353
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:28,754
>> Maria: YOU MAKE A LOT OF GOOD

354
00:09:28,754 --> 00:09:29,521
POINTS, LADIES.

355
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,223
YOU THINK THE MID-TERMS WILL BE

356
00:09:31,223 --> 00:09:32,024
SUCCESSFUL FOR THE REPUBLICANS?

357
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:33,926
>> I'M LOOKING FOR THEM TO BE

358
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:34,760
SUCCESSFUL FOR THE REPUBLICAN

359
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,093
PARTY.

360
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:36,495
>> THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

361
00:09:36,495 --> 00:09:38,096
BLUE WAVE AND SEEMS TO BE SORT

362
00:09:38,096 --> 00:09:39,565
OF IN THE BACK SEAT RIGHT NOW.

363
00:09:39,565 --> 00:09:41,166
>> BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES

364
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,568
COMING OUTS OF THE TRUMP

365
00:09:42,568 --> 00:09:44,203
ADMINISTRATION, THAT HAS HAD AN

366
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:44,536
IMPACT.

367
00:09:44,536 --> 00:00:00,000
>> VOTE RIGHT OR YOU'RE GOING TO
