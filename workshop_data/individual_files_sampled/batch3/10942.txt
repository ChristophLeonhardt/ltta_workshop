Mexico with top of the group six points they were taking on a Swedish side who had to get a victory I don't know how many people fancy their chances but things look an awful lot better after 50 minutes now this was Ludwig or goo Stinson getting the breakthrough for them let's take a look at how that goal came about yeah and you know Sweden they today they got everything they deserved I mean they they suffered that laid laid their defeat to Germany that Toni Kroos called that that that could suck the energy out of any football player and it's something that you carry on for days Sweden didn't have days it was Sunday night and here we have Wednesday so it was basically straight down to - back to business right away did you think they would have the energy because that must have taken so much out of them the manner of that late defeat against the athletes in Sweden oh they're famous for their toughness and mental toughness and you remember someone like it you just gone war for instance who just stood in the baseline returned John McEnroe's whatever he was he was trying to do but they have this it's a mentality thing in Sweden they can really really when they need to they can focus on things and they did that today and you have to remember this game was played in their key 13 boy this is where the the temporary stands are actually outside the stadium and it's fair to say that for most of that game you know the Mexican team were in that stand they were completely played off the page I thought it was an excellent performance by by Sweden and they deserved to win three now and three now there's not a big picture in this game because again Sweden got we talked about this a half time it didn't get a penalty when tavar I still think when we see what else has been given in penalties they should have had it it was at nil nil but again mental toughness they took it into halftime they had a chat came out firing on all cylinders on the right from the word go and then five minutes into that half they got the reward and a1 they'll need and at this point you have to remember Sweden really needing a victory so they couldn't have relaxed at this point they would have breathe a little easier though in 62 minutes this was the defender and there is a grunt Granquist increasing their leads so this was the this the penalty that was Moreno sliding in a Marcus Berg of course Berg denied a penalty against Germany finally Sweden getting some decisions going going away from the referee yeah this was not going to var but instead of going to have our Gronk has put it in the top corner and I think he must have looked at what how he came did the other day this is by the way it's gonca second goal and penalty in this tournament then there he was for me he was he was man of the match he's send a half and the way he played today he looks a bit worn out and I'm not saying old but he looks a bit tired at times but today he was majestic he was really leading his team in he was a grand example example on on what a captain in the team can do just by showing indeed you know it's what we're talking about no person it's not the captain for Germany but just by showing just having that body like just showing everybody else I want this and I show you how to do it's very plenty because I know people have seen Harry Kane do it a couple of times that's not a any easy penalty it's brave isn't it to go top secrets and he did it over the bar two games ago and yesterday he tried the same thing and he was successful it doesn't take much these balls are very light you know you try to lift the ball up in that you know can easily just give it a little bit too much and that's why you will see most people most people will roll the ball hard soft whatever you know I try to take the good but but roll the ball around the grass because it's a it definitely won't go over so but and if Sweden had any nerves whatsoever to know they were certainly settled by a Mexico team self-destructing really 74 minutes it was known goal from Edison Alvarez and and I think they've given up the ghost by at this point they they were deflated and Sweden were all over them and three nil was suppose was was looking in every new there was a really good result I'm I'm a little bit disappointed with Mexico I'm not gonna take anything away from Sweden Sweden were fantastic today I think what Sweden did today it was was one of the best performances from a team in these World Cups so far but did disappointment with Mexico is that because with one node and then what you know then then with three no then they're thinking that going out of the World Cup and and they know that the other team in the group which was Germany they needed a result as well and they also knew they were not getting it but what happened in that second half and the goal started to go in was the style to lose that discipline first of all the discipline in in the system they've played so well and they have played well in the previous two games but also their disciplinary discipline so they started to kick players you got - got a few bookings and the referee had he been nitpicking could have done a lot worse for Mexico and this is this is the you know the mindset was or we're defeated now we're going out the fact is they're actually going on so if you carry silly yellow yellow cards for something that happened in this game into the next round you could still get banned by another yellow card worthy to go through into the quarterfinals and that for me was a little bit of a disappointment on the Mexican team but the two games they've played this thoroughly deserved the two games they've won they thoroughly deserve to go through there's no doubt about that they have been a fantastic team in this rule and in Sweden's performances I think have been solid and today they were excellent and I'm very many many congratulations to the two teams if Mexico had gone out six points that would have been extremely unfortunate and it would have been a great loss of the competition not only in terms of their play I think but also in terms of their fans it seems like probably every other Mexico supporter carries some kind of instrument it's pretty adept at using it they have been colorful they have been loud and somehow they've made it through to the last 16 despite today's performance you
