Cynthia Nixon and Governor Andrew Cuomo are going head-to-head in the gubernatorial race in New York and in a recent debate the one and only debate that they will participate in things got very very heated and I have to admit that I enjoyed it I am biased so I'm gonna be completely honest with you on that I think Cynthia Nixon brought up issues that are incredibly important to progressives she came across as very strong in the first opening statement she did seem a little nervous I'm gonna be honest about that I'm honest about all of this by the way but as soon as she got into the flow of the debate she came across as very powerful very strong so with that said I want to toss you the first video that stood out to me personally this is Cynthia Nixon arguing that Cuomo has not done enough when it comes to resisting Trump's policies take a look Donald Trump did tweet at you about whether or not America was great and you backed down pretty quickly you stood up to him about as well as he stands up to Putin when it comes to opposing Donald Trump in New York State we already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House we don't need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main opposition Wow that was strong by the way at one point in the debate I do want to read you this quote when Andrew Cuomo who has a hearty lead in the polls asked Cynthia Nixon a third time to stop interrupting him and to be fair she did interrupt him quite a bit Nixon had a quick response if you stop lying because there were a number of instances where he did lie I'm gonna give you a specific example in just a moment but before I get to all of that what do you guys think about what we've seen so far well I loved the fact that she was challenging him on the way that he was presenting himself as an anti Trump you know defender of the people and that's how he was constantly trying to frame the difference between him and Nixon as allegedly the celebrity running for office who know nothing and even called her a corporation at at some point because he he exploited the fact that most people don't understand how freelancers and artists are forced into this S corporation filing around taxes and that because of that he was able to deflect all of the like very reasonable and validated charges she had about his own relationship with corporations exactly so let me give you a little bit more on that so Cynthia Nixon refuses to take corporate PAC money that is very important to us here at the Young Turks for obvious reasons and Cuomo keeps attacking her for supposedly refusing to release her tax returns although she has released five years worth of tax returns so she is being transparent he released his tax returns as well but apparently he released more of his tax returns than she did or meaning more years worth of tax returns but she's being she's not taking corporate PAC money like let's be like blunt about that that is an incredibly important aspect of being a progressive candidate right now and she certainly fits the bill when it comes to that she fits the bill when it comes to her policy proposals and we'll get to specific examples in just a moment mark yeah III thought she was very strong painting him as what he is which is a corporate Democrat he's a corporatist all the way also comparing the limited way that he stood up to Trump Minh he really just cowered the Trump I thought those were two clean shots and from a debate standpoint what we're seeing I think just in these political debates generally you know Trump was involved in some of this on the Republican side and the presidential debates if you wait too much if you're all about the decorum of it you don't carry the night and you don't win the soundbite war so I also give her real props if I can use that word I give her a lot of credit for taking the fight to him it's oftentimes tough when you're a challenger and the a tendency might be to want to play by the rules because I know I'm not a politician and this is a new forum she came right out and she was going toe to toe to him so just in terms of the way things felt I really give her a lot of credit for the way she took the fight to him absolutely so she gets a little more specific about his lack of progressive policies in the next clip if you really care about a president that's rolling back Obamacare why haven't you fought harder for single-payer if you really care why have you prioritized Republican leadership of the Senate over the reproductive health after two ajikko divided road versus wade into law here when we pulled out of the Paris climate Accords why have you not fought for the climate and communities Protection Act movement which would have caused a hundred percent just transition to renewable energy here in New York State so she outlined a lot of her policies in that statement and everything that she said was accurate and you know she gave you Cuomo's response it was very similar to what you hear his brothers say on CNN when it comes to single-payer specifically how are we gonna pay for it how are we gonna pay for it and you know there were a number of follow-up questions for Cynthia Nixon pertaining to that very issue how do we pay for it and so there was a rand study that's been misconstrued to make it seem like single-payer would actually cost people a lot more money it would certainly increase taxes but when you consider how much it would save the average American in health care costs it actually saves them money overall even if their taxes go up a little bit so she addressed that and Cuomo's only response was how are we gonna pay for it we've gone over this over and over again they're not interested in acknowledging the very specific detailed answers you know responding to how we would pay for it that was the other thing I really liked it that she did she hit him substantively on these policy issues and she think it wasn't talking points clearly she's been on the stump and can talk about these things in depth I was very impressed that she spoke specifics he defaulted to talking points as you say he defaulted to the how are we gonna pay for it huh that was something else she did she was very very strong it's really a shame because in that race um she's she's the Dark Horse certainly right but and you look anything's possible and like when you look at Gilliam in in Florida a gubernatorial race I mean that was a stunning upset that no one expected very few expected and he delivered so you never know what could happen the most important thing is to encourage people to go out there and vote right right and she has two weeks I mean September 13th is when they're gonna be voting and he doesn't have any plans stump speeches anywhere else really he's not trying to campaign as forcefully as she is no he's um purring down like an incumbent does exactly exactly so it's actually I mean she there is a big point spread we're not gonna lie about that last poll which was at the end of July was about 30 points but she has on her side the fight to want to win it and to also move him to the left yes you know so I think that we can't under like you said like Gilliam like Alexandria Ocasio Cortes I'm really proud that I said that but we've had we've been forced to learn her name in a national sense because of how much she did surprise folks who had cast her out from the traditional Democratic machine and so I you know I don't I don't I don't cast Nixon out and I think this is actually a very important debate that wasn't gonna happen yes exactly and I'm glad the debate happened because I personally learned a lot not just about not just about Cynthia Nixon but just how establishment Cuomo really is I mean we did a story yesterday about a campaign donation that he accepted and then he did a favor for a law firm representing Harvey Weinstein like I knew he was corrupt but a thing that I've noticed with incumbents is how incredibly entitled they are and how much they underestimate their opponents because that certainly happened with Alexandria costume Cortes when she had her debate with Crowley it was amazing how unprepared he was he just showed up thinking oh Sh 20 years old look what is she she doesn't know what she's doing and she went in there guns blazing and was so powerful so strong and you see the same thing play out with this Cuomo Nixon debate and I just love it like keep under estimating just keep doing it right ever know what could happen right and like you were saying that mark he was just relying on the talking points and in this age where people have the internet and have programs like The Young Turks you can't really manipulate Englander in sorry cannot manipulate ignorant in the same way and expect it to work for you like him saying well how you're gonna pay for it clearly there is a study around it and also trying to spin her talking to mayor de Blasio about knots like helicopters during a Shakespeare in the Park performance as calling in a favor like that used to be some sort of expose on her relationship to the establishment you can't rely on those things and spinning it is gonna actually make you look worse so one final part that I want to get to in this clip is Cynthia Nixon's thoughts on single-payer take a look we can we can ensure all of our people here by a single-payer medicare-for-all system we can do it better we can do it cheaper we can do it with no co-pays with no deductibles and 98% of New Yorkers would pay less for their health care than they do now so I wanted to show you that clip so you know exactly where she stands on that issue again Cuomo responded to that by asking oh well how would we pay for it and then after Cynthia Nixon clearly identified how it would be paid for he essentially said that it would be better if the federal government does this rather than doing it on a state level so you're ticklish knowing knowing that's not gonna happen the feds yeah that's what I'm talking about I talked about he just defaults to that general corporatized political talking point and you're right Anna that's so key both of you have noted I think something important here which is that some of these issues that she mentioned the debate you want to hear them out there in the national zeitgeist you want to hear them on shows like ours you want to see those clips on the morning shows because now just the idea of single-payer is getting out there in the political atmosphere such that you hope it has some staying power I mean this is an incremental battle and we may not have a lot of time to be fair but boy it's cool that she is speaking about these things that we need to have as part of the national dialogue right and and the legalization of marijuana is a racial justice issue he nowhere near touched that and also I mean something else that was important is this focus on the fact that she isn't taking corporate tax but he also is relying on default talking points and saying well I am for campaign finance reform again also knowing that that's not gonna happen on a federal level did you know the TYT network is now
