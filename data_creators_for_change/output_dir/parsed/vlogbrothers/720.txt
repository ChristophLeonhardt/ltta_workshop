Ughhhhh
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.
I had all kinds of plans for today's video but instead it's going to be about tiny chickens
because I've been invaded.
Ughhhhhh
Quick sidenote for nerdfighters-in-training:
Tiny Chicken Disease is, of course, a disease in which tiny chickens invade your nose
and then they
poop
snot
which makes you sick.
Right, Hank so over the weekend,
the Yeti got Tiny Chicken Disease
and I was like,
"Don't worry! I'm immune to Yeti diseases."
Well I'm not!
Hank, I don't want to gross you out or anything,
but last night,
I drank like 14 liquid tons of snot.
It was like chinese water torture,
except instead of water dripping onto my forehead,
it was just snot
dripping down my throat,
all night.
And I didn't sleep and now I'm walking around with like
28 000 pounds of chicken poop in my body.
It's just not comfortable.
The weirdest thing about tiny chickens is that you become--
Sarah.
Yeah?
What's up?
: Don't forget to vote!
Ohhhhhh
Are you serious?
: Yeah.
UGGGGGH
I DON'T WANNA VOTE TODAY.
I'M SICK.
Hank, after I failed to vote in Florida in the 2000 presidential election,
I made a promise to myself
and to my country
that I would always vote.
Alright, let's go.
But I'm taking you with me!
Hank, don't get me wrong.
I like voting,
I'm grateful to vote,
I just don't think my vote matters that much.
And I don't meant that in the obvious way,
like, "lots of people vote and my vote only counts once",
I mean that whenever I'm doing like Crash Course research,
I've become increasingly convinced that
the most important actors in human history aren't voters,
they're microbes.
I went to the wrong polling place.
Now I have to try again.
On the upside, I met nerdfighting poll workers, Neil and Aidan.
Alright, let's try again.
Uggggggh
I vote.
I count.
The tiny chickens will win in the end, Hank,
but until then,
I'm doing my part.
See you on Friday.
PS. Nerdfighters,
Hank and I will be hanging out via Google+ tomorrow afternoon
on the Crash Course channel.
Go to  and subscribe to watch it.
It'll be tomorrow afternoon
at 3pm Eastern Time;
I don't know what time that is in your timezone.
I'm sick and tired
and I'm sorry
but you can look it up on this amazing thing called the Internet.
