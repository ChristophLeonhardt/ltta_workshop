This is not C.G.I., 
it’s J.G.I.: 
Jellyfish Generated
Imagery.
In this case the bioluminescent 
atolla jellyfish.
It’s a kind of amazing display
that comes from creatures 
in the sea
that make their own
light.
And there are a lot of them.
A recent study found that
among ocean dwellers that 
you can see with the naked eye,
although of course,
you'd have to be underwater 
for most of them,
three quarters are
bioluminescent.
Steven Haddock did the study.
“I always think of it like a
superpower. 
We think of these as, like, ‘oh, they're 
so primitive, these creatures'
but they can do something 
that we can only dream of doing, 
you know? 
Making light come out 
of your fingertips 
or throwing pixie dust
of glowing light  out at will."

These creatures make light with
chemicals in their own bodies.
These creatures make light with
chemicals in their own bodies.
This is how they do it.
Luciferase, an enzyme,
prompts a chemical reaction
in which luciferin molecules
absorb energy
and then release
it as light.
Often they’re trying to scare
off predators.
They may even shoot out
bioluminescent material,
like this shrimp expelling a
blob of light.
Most of this world is hidden
from human beings.
There are yellow sea worms,
red ctenophores,
bristle worms,
small crustaceans
and lots and lots of
jellyfish.
When you see some of these
creatures,
it’s a reminder that the world 
is full of Cinderellas. 
Sea cucumbers.
They’re pretty ugly. 
Just lumps to most humans. 
But when they light up at night, 
the party is on.
