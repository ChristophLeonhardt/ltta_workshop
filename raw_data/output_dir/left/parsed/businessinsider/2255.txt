castle of boxes because their cryptic
animals they like to hide and a box
gives them a place of safety and
security they can get into that box and
they can't be approached from the side
or in the back where they're not aware
of it the other thing is they can sit in
that box feeling safe and they can watch
the world go around in front of them and
if something interesting comes by they
can dash out you know sometimes we'll
see people talk about you know they they
walk by in the cattle you know swat at
their ankles or if you roll a toy past
them they'll run out and grab it then
they can run back in that box and feel
safe and secure again
