Prudential. Bring your challenges. Shepard: CONTINUING COVERAGE OF FOX TOP STORY REPORT FROM SOUTH KOREAN NEWS AGENCY THAT THE DICTATOR KIM JONG UN HAS CANCELLED HIS MEETING WITH THE SOUTH KOREANS AND IS THREATENING TO CANCEL WHAT WOULD BE AN HISTORIC SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE REASON? JOINT MILITARY DRILLS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA. LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO MICHAEL O'HANLON FROM THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION. SENIOR FELLOW OF FOREIGN POLICY THERE. MICHAEL, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU. GOOD TO SEE YOU, SHEPARD. Shepard: THESE DRILLS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOREVER. THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE COMPLAINED ABOUT THEM FOREVER. SUDDENLY THEY ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THEM AGAIN. AS USUAL YOU GOT RIGHT TO THE POINT. THE IF YOU PLEASEY THING WAS THOUGH THEY DIDN'T COMPLAIN THEM B. THEM FOR A COUPLE MONTHS. IN FACT, WHEN THE SOUTH KOREAN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR WENT TO NORTH KOREA A FEW WEEKS AGO, IT WAS REMARKABLE THAT HE CAME BACK WITH THE NEWS THAT KIM JONG UN DIDN'T MIND THE EXERCISES, SUPPOSEDLY. AND SAID THAT HE UNDERSTOOD WHY THEY HAD TO HAPPEN, WHICH, OF COURSE, IS WHAT WE SAY AND WHAT WE FIRMLY BELIEVE. AS LONG AS THERE IS A POWERFUL MILITARY THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA, EVEN IF THE ATMOSPHERICS ARE BETTER THESE DAYS, WE HAVE TO THAT I TAKETHAT THREAT SERIOUSLY. TWO BIG DRILLS FOR A YEAR FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IT LOOKED AS IF NORTH KOREA WASN'T GOING TO CARE. THAT WAS GOING TO BE APPARENTLY A CONCESSION. MAYBE THEY ARE STARTING TO RETHINK THEIR TACTICS, MAYBE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE GIVING AWAY TOO MANY CONCESSIONS FOR FREE BEFORE A NEGOTIATION OR MAYBE KIM JONG UN IS LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE TO GET OUT OF THE SUMMIT ALL TOGETHER BECAUSE HE DECIDES HE DOESN'T LIKE THE PATH THAT HE IS HEADED ON TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION. THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF POSSIBILITIES. Shepard: WHO SAYS HE IS HEADED TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION. ONLY HE SAYS THAT. HE HAS ALREADY GOTTEN A LOT HERE, HASN'T HE? WELL, HE HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF DIPLOMATIC ATTENTION. Shepard: THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. I BELIEVE THE CHINESE HAS LIGHTENED UP IN SOME OF THEIR ENFORCEMENT OF SANCTIONS. THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO, BY THE WAY BUT THEY HAVE. OTHERWISE HE HASN'T GOTTEN MUCH CONCRETE OR TANGIBLE NOW YET. HE HAS GOTTEN PROMISE OF POTENTIAL DOWN THE ROAD IF HE WHEN HE GIVES UP NUKES. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS HOLDING UP THE LINE THE BENEFITS WON'T FLOW UNTIL ALL THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE OUT. I UNDERSTAND WHY PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BEGIN WITH THAT GOING IN POSITION. I DON'T THINK IT'S REALISTIC THOUGH AS A WAY TO GET THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS. SO MAYBE WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW IS KIM JONG UN STARTING TO NEGOTIATE BACK BEFORE THE TALKS EVEN BEGIN FACE TO FACE. Shepard: WHAT DOES HISTORY TELL US ABOUT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW? IT'S NOT AS IF WE HAVEN'T REACHED THIS POINT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR IN RECENT YEARS. RIGHT. WELL, THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF SUMMITS WITH NORTH KOREA. OF COURSE, THE PACE OF THESE RECENT MEETINGS WITH SECRETARY POMPEO AND PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH KOREA AND OTHERS HAS REALLY INCREDIBLY INTENSIFIED AND THE PROMISE OF A SUMMIT WITH A U.S. PRESIDENT IS A FIRST-TIME THING, UNPRECEDENTED IN RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA. BUT, WE HAVE HAD PREVIOUS PERIODS, SO-CALLED SUNSHINE POLICY OF ABOUT 18 OR 20 YEARS AGO AND SOUTH KOREA REALLY TRIED TO BE WARM TOWARDS THE NORTH WHEN KIM JONG UN'S FATHER WAS IN POWER THERE. AND THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT. YOU KNOW, THE SOUTH KOREANS CHANGED PRESIDENTS. KIM JUDGE ILL BEHAVED MUCH WORSE. HE BROKE OUT OF A NUCLEAR AGREEMENT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO AT THAT TIME. STATE OF BELLIGERENCE. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST. Shepard: I WANT TO READ SOMETHING WE HAVE JUST GOTTEN. THIS EXERCISE TARGETING US, SAYS THE NORTH KOREANS, WHICH IS BEING CARRIED OUT ACROSS SOUTH KOREA, IS A FLAGRANT CHALLENGE TO PAN MOON JOM AND DECLARATION RUNNING COUNTER TO THE POSITIVE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. AGAIN, THAT FROM THIS REPORT THAT HAS JUST COME OUT. QUOTING AGAIN, THE UNITED STATES WILL ALSO HAVE TO UNDERTAKE CAREFULLY DELIBERATIONS ABOUT THE FATE OF THE PLANNED NORTH KOREA-U.S. SUMMIT IN LIGHT OF THIS PROVOCATIVE MILITARY WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES. NOW, THAT SUDDENLY AND FINALLY SOUNDS LIKE NORTH KOREA AGAIN. YEAH. ALL THOUGH THE WORD RUCKUS IS PRETTY MILD BY THEIR STANDARD. Shepard: IT. USUALLY FIND MUCH MORE COLORFUL LANGUAGE. POINT WELL-TAKEN. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF BUYER'S REMORSE. THE NORTH KOREAS AREN'T COMFORT WBLE DETAUNT WHEN IT HINGES ON THEM GIVING UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THEIR ENTIRETY REALLY FAST. I SEE THIS AS A EMPLOYEE I SEE THIS AS P EMPLOYEE I SEE THIS AS PLOMPLOYEE I SEE THIS AS PLOYPLOYEE I SEE THIS AS PLOY AOYEE I SEE THIS AS PLOY ASYEE I SEE THIS AS PLOY AS AE NEGOTIATION PROCESS. I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WANT THE SUMMIT TO BE CANCELLED, AT LEAST NOT YET. THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY WE ARE NOT GOING TO ARE NOT GOING AO ARE NOT GOING AS EASY AS FIRST SEEN. THEY HAVE THEN ABOUT THIS UPCOMING EXERCISE PHOTOGRAPHER AS YOU POINTED OUT, SHEPARD, THEY EVEN SAID THEY DIDN'T CARE. IF THEY ARE NOW GOING BACK TO AN EARLIER COMPLAINT, IT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO USE IT FOR A PURPOSE. EITHER AS A NEGOTIATING CARD OR BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NERVOUS ABOUT THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF DETENTE AND THEY WANT IT TO STOP AND JUST GO BACK TO WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR WHICH I WOULD REGRET BUT IT WOULD BE TYPICAL OF WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST. Shepard: THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE NOW GIVEN THE UNITED STATES ADMINISTRATION AN INSTRUCTION. HOW MIGHT OUR ADMINISTRATION RESPOND IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT SERVES OUR INTERESTS? WELL, WE HAVE TO KEEP DOING MILITARY EXERCISES IN SOUTH KOREA, AS YOU WELL KNOW, SHEPARD, AND AS ANY MILITARY OFFICER IN THE UNITED STATES WILL INSIST UPON. I HAVE DONE SOME WRITING OVER THE YEARS IN WHICH I HAVE SUGGESTED WITH A COLLEAGUE HERE THAT WE COULD PERHAPS SCALE THEM BACK IN SIZE. THAT THE SIZE. EXERCISES IS NOT CRUCIAL TO MILITARY READINESS. IF IT REALLY GIVES NORTH KOREANS SOME ANXIETY, WE COULD FIND A WAY TO BREAK THE EXERCISES UP INTO SMALLER PIECES. I THINK THAT'S MOST WE COULD CONSIDER DOING. IF THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM, I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO THINK THINGS THROUGH IN THOSE TERMS.
