1
00:00:03,775 --> 00:00:05,385
“Wir sind das Volk.”

2
00:00:05,385 --> 00:00:09,310
In German it means, “We are the people.”

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,840
This chant echoed through the
streets of Chemnitz, Germany,

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,470
this week, as far-right
protesters set out

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,690
to vent their frustrations, create
mayhem and attack refugees.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,780
It was also heard in Clausnitz
in early 2016,

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,050
as a mob of Germans surrounded
a bus of refugees entering

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,140
their town.

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,942
And later that year in Bautzen,

10
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,772
as 80 Germans chased
some 20 teenage refugees

11
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:46,605
through the streets.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,880
The chant has become a go-to
for the German far right.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,000
But it wasn’t always an
extremist rallying cry.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,450
“Leipzig is a city of
protest again tonight.”

15
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:07,140
In 1989, people in East
Germany took to the streets

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,600
to demand more
freedom, after living

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,020
under an oppressive
communist regime for decades.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,350
Their movement was neither
of the right nor the left.

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,200
It was a cry for democracy.

20
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,240
After German reunification,

21
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,620
the chant largely disappeared.

22
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,150
But in recent
years, it has been

23
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,170
co-opted by far-right groups

24
00:01:49,170 --> 00:00:00,000
who violently oppose Angela
Merkel’s open border policies.
