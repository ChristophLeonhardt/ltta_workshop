WATCHING THE WHEELS TURN.
>> Trace: JOHN ROBERTS LIVE
FOR US ON THE NORTH LAWN.
JOHN, THANK YOU.
LET'S BRING IN CHRIS WALL
LALS THE ANCHOR OF "FOX NEWS
SUNDAY."
CHRIS, YOU NAILED IT LITTLE
EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE SAYING
LOOK, ALL BETS ARE OFF.
CHRIS COONS CAME OUT AND
SAID HE THINKS THAT THE
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, THE
ONE THAT'S BEFORE THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SHOULD
BE THE FOCUS OF THIS FBI
INVESTIGATION.
BUT, WHO KNOWS IF ANOTHER
ALLEGATION COMES FORWARD
THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF.
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU
KNOW, THERE IS ALL THIS TALK
ABOUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON
CHUCK GRASSLEY AND IT ALL
DEPENDS ON PRESIDENT TRUMP.
IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T.
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE THREE
MODERATE APPARENTLY WAVERING
REPUBLICANS, JEFF FLAKE,
LISA MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN
COLLINS.
IF TWO OF THE THREE ARE
DEMANDING A WEEK DELAY UNTIL
THERE IS AT MOST UNTIL THERE
IS AN FBI INVESTIGATION OF
THE ALLEGATIONS, THEN THEY
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE
TO THAT AND HAVE A WEEK
DELAY.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE 50
VOTES PLUS THE TIE BREAKING
VOTE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT
TO PUT THE NOMINATION OVER
THE TOP.
AND, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, TIME IS AN ENEMY
OF THIS NOMINATION.
AND AS WE SAW OVER THE LAST
FEW DAYS, AND THEY SEEM TO
HAVE BEEN PRETTY THIN, ALL
OF A SUDDEN OR COMPLETELY
FALSE THESE ALLEGATIONS KEPT
COMING IN ABOUT BRETT
KAVANAUGH AND IF THERE IS A
WEEK DELAY, I DON'T WANT TO
BE CYNICAL ABOUT THIS, BUT I
BET THERE WILL BE MORE
ALLEGATIONS AND I BET AND I
DON'T WANT TO BE CYNICAL
ABOUT THIS EITHER THAT MAYBE
NOT CHRIS COONS BUT SOME OF
THE OTHER DEMOCRATS WILL SAY
WELL, A WEEK IS NOT ENOUGH
TO CONSIDER THOSE AND WE
HAVE GOT TO TAKE MORE TIME.
THIS REALLY DOES PUT THE
NOMINATION OF BRETT
KAVANAUGH IN SOME JEOPARDY
WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THESE
ALLEGATIONS PROVE OUT TO BE
TRUE OR NOT.
>> Trace: A.P. JUST ALERTED,
CHRIS AND I WATCHED YOUR
COVERAGE ALL DAY YESTERDAY
YOU ALLUDED TO THIS MARK
JUDGE HAS NOW SAID HE WILL
COOPERATE IN THIS.
THAT IS HUGE AS WE GO
FORWARD.
>> YES, IT IS.
BECAUSE, LOOK, I DON'T THINK
THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATION
OF THE CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD
ALLEGATION SHOULD TAKE THAT
LONG.
I MEAN, THERE ARE ONLY,
WHAT, THREE OTHER PEOPLE
THAT SHE NAMES, MARK JUDGE,
SOME FRIEND OF KAVANAUGH,
AND JUDGE FRIEND PJ AND
FRIEND LEE LAND KAISER.
NOT LIKE INVESTIGATION GOT
ALL TENTACLES GOING OUT.
THEY COULD TALK TO THEM
PRETTY QUICKLY.
THEY ALL DENIED ANYTHING HAD
HAPPENED.
OBVIOUSLY A STATEMENT
WRITTEN THROUGH A LAWYER, A
WRITTEN STATEMENT IS
DIFFERENT THAN SUBMITTING TO
AN FBI QUESTIONING.
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CALL
IT INTERROGATION OR NOT.
AND OBVIOUSLY, DEMOCRATS ARE
COUNTING ON THE IDEA THAT
SUDDENLY ONE OF THEM IS
GOING TO CRACK AND SAY OH,
YEAH, DO I REMEMBER IT AND
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED
