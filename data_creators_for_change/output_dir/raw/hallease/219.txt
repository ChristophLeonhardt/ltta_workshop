interlocking my hair for the first time

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,430
about a week ago I finally decided that

12
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,630
retwisting just really wasn't working

13
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,559
for me my hair is so thick that I would

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,559
retwist and then by the time a week had

15
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,170
passed I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a shower and wash</font>

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">my hair and once I got in and wash my</font>

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,390

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,840
read twisted at all and i like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

19
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it doesn't</font>

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,449
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> so twisted you know I kind of like</font>

21
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:00,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of has more of a natural</font>

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,699
your hair looks like it naturally does

23
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,939
that look rather than like you can see

24
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you twisted your scalp another</font>

25
