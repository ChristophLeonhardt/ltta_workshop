now we got to turn to your money and Wall Street where stocks are roaring back this morning after two days of stomach-turning plunges more than 1300 points on the Dow here's where we are right now a little over half an hour into the trading day and boom Dow Jones Industrial Average up almost 3:30 this morning we've already heard from Treasury secretary Steve minuchin he spoke to CNBC and he downplayed the recent market turmoil I think the fundamentals are still very strong the US economy is strong US earnings are strong so I see this is just a natural correction after the markets were up a lot I would agree with that most professional investors would - the person who hasn't is the president let's bring in CBC contributor Ron and Sanne and Whitney for the hour Republican strategist my friend a well Nick poor and host of slates daily podcast the gist Mike Pesce mister Insogna let's start with you we just heard from Steve minuchin and he said a pretty reasonable thing no it's not the Fed this is normal market moves what do you think well it could solve that I mean it could be the Fed and it could be a normal market move if the stock market is responding to what has been an ongoing series of interest rate increases from the Fed as it attempts to normalize interest rate policy in a post crisis world so oftentimes you expect the market to have at least on occasion a negative reaction of the prospects of rising interest rates short rates and long rates have jumped pretty sharply in the last week they've moderated in the last couple of days and so that does put downward pressure on stocks along with a host of other consideration of Stephanie like the ongoing trade war with China worries about a global economic slowdown and even some potential weakness in housing and auto sales here have all been identified as reasons for the pretty sharp pullback we've seen in the last couple days but Ron should we acknowledge that one of the reasons the Fed looks to raise interest rates especially when the economy is doing so well is because they need to create a cushion because if things do turn and we face a recession they need to have some sort of lever to help us and with rates extraordinarily low they won't have that and one of the things that could cause such a recession would be the deficit ballooning and it has ballooned at the hand the current President of the United States yeah it one could argue that the reason the economy is so strong is that the president with the tax cut and with the rather large two-year budget that was passed has borrowed from future growth and pulled some of it forward which is why the economy has accelerated lately which is why that in the Federal Reserve has to raise interest rates to keep inflation from going too far above its 2% target so you have in a certain sense monetary and fiscal policy right now working at cross-purposes and should there be a recession in the next year or two you're not going to get another tax cut you're not going to get more spending the only thing you have is the Federal Reserve lowering rates again and so yes in addition to building a cushion the feds also responding to the fact that the economy is strong enough at least in the short run to withstand these interest rate increases which it should be doing if indeed the economy's accelerating at this point we're out of the crisis mode long out of it in fact and so it's appropriate for the Fed to behave the way they are all right Ron Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans he spoke with your colleague and my friend Steve Liesman this morning and he was specifically asked about the president's comments saying that the Fed has gone wild a bit Loco here's what he said we're looking at the economy we're looking at a very strong economy strong fundamentals and we're adjusting the policy stance we've been doing that gradually increasing rates we've been moving up we're targeting two to two and a quarter percent right now I kind of think neutral is in the two and three quarters to three percent so after many many years of accommodative policy which I have supported strongly because inflation is now up at 2% it's time to readjust the policy stance at least neutral let's see how the economy is performing at that point and then we might have to do a little bit more after that Ron what do you make of that well I think that's a perfect explanation you know the president and others said that the Fed was crazy to bring interest rates down to zero in the post-crisis environment and keep them there for so long creating a bubble in the stock market now the president's complaining the feds raising rates and also touting a very strong economy at the same time so there's a lot of cognitive dissonance there this is exactly what the Fed should be doing at this juncture they managed to keep us from going into a Great Depression very deftly and now they're very gently handling the normalization of interest rates and so I think the Fed could go too far they could precipitate a bear market in stocks they could help to precipitate a recession but right now that's not what they're doing and they're really just trying to get rates back to normal around three percent for short-term rates and again they will have some cushion should the economy slow down but this is an environment where interest rates should be normal and the people who complained about the first round of unconventional policies after the crisis were wrong and they're wrong again with respect to what the Fed is doing now hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over
