1
00:00:03,245 --> 00:00:03,546
SHORT?

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,547
[CHEERS & APPLAUSE]

3
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:06,282
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

4
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,283
STOP IT.

5
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:09,218
THE WORLD IS LOOKING GOOD.

6
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,187
NORTH KOREA IS CALMING DOWN.

7
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:12,922
NO ISIS.

8
00:00:12,922 --> 00:00:15,057
UNEMPLOYMENT AT ITS LOWEST IN

9
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:15,357
AGES.

10
00:00:15,357 --> 00:00:17,660
TRUMP HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH

11
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,862
THAT NIGERIAN GUY.

12
00:00:19,862 --> 00:00:23,632
I THINK HE WROTE ME A LONG

13
00:00:23,632 --> 00:00:26,769
E-MAIL ONCE.

14
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:28,070
SENT HIM 10 GRAND, NEVER HEARD

15
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,905
FROM HIM AGAIN.

16
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,173
WONDER WHAT HAPPENED.

17
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:33,209
WHILE THE WORLD IMPROVES, THE

18
00:00:33,209 --> 00:00:35,377
MEDIA FOCUSING ON THE WORST.

19
00:00:35,377 --> 00:00:37,146
THE "THE NEW YORK TIMES" RAN AN

20
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:41,750
ARTICLE ENTITLED "HAPPY 200th

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:46,322
BIRTHDAY, KARL MARX.

22
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:47,423
YOU WERE RIGHT ."

23
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,592
BUT WHAT A STRANGE THING TO SAY.

24
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:52,394
I GUESS THE TRIBUTE TO JOHNS

25
00:00:52,394 --> 00:00:54,363
WILKES BOOTHE WASN'T READY YET.

26
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:58,901
BUT AS THE WRITER GLORIFIES THE

27
00:00:58,901 --> 00:01:02,471
DEAD COME

28
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:03,973
DEAD COMIE, WE BELIEVE THE TIMES

29
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:06,242
DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH SO WE

30
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:07,977
CREATED A REAL SALUTE.

31
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:12,681
>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY KARL MARX.

32
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:17,586
RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE YUNA

33
00:01:17,586 --> 00:01:23,392
BOMBER.

34
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,261
IN FACT IT WAS SUCH AN AWESOME

35
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:27,429
IDEA THAT A BUNCH OF COUNTRIES

36
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:30,299
TRIED IT, LIKE LENNON'S SOVIET

37
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,837
UNION FEATURES MASS

38
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:35,905
IMPRISONMENT.

39
00:01:35,905 --> 00:01:38,774
CASTRO'S CUBA FEATURES ANIMAL

40
00:01:38,774 --> 00:01:40,042
FARM EQUIPMENT.

41
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:43,078
AND VENEZUELA, TOILET PAPER

42
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:43,879
LINES FOR DAYS.

43
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,216
AND A BUNCH OF COUNTRIES THAT

44
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:50,452
DON'T EXIST ANYMORE.

45
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:53,389
AND THERE'S EVEN COMMUNIST

46
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:54,857
NATIONS AROUND TODAY LIKE NORTH

47
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:56,759
KOREA BUT THEY WON'T ADMIT IT

48
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,360
BECAUSE IT'S SO SUCCESSFUL THEY

49
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,596
DON'T WANT TO RUB IT IN THE REST

50
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:03,232
OF THE WORLD'S FACE.

51
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:08,871
HAPPY 200 BIRTHDAY, BRO.

52
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:12,274
GREG: WELL DONE.

53
00:02:12,274 --> 00:02:13,676
SO WE JUST WHIPPED THAT

54
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,043
TOGETHER.

55
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:16,278
SO AS THE WORLD ENTERS AN

56
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:18,547
OPTIMISTIC AGE, THE MEDIA STILL

57
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:20,149
CHASES WORDS AND NOT DEEDS.

58
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:23,519
THE LATEST FREAK OUT, WHAT TRUMP

59
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:27,089
SAID ABOUT WHAT GIULIANI SAID

60
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:28,691
ABOUT, YOU GUESSED IT, STORMY.

61
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:30,859
>> IT WAS STAGGERING.

62
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,795
>> VERY CONFUSING.

63
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:34,530
>> IT IS ASPHONNISHING.

64
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,864
>> DISGRACEFUL.

65
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,499
>> ASTONISHING.

66
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:37,967
>> STUNNING.

67
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:39,702
>> THAT WAS A DISASTER.

68
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:42,972
>> OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL

69
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:47,843
TERM ARE FREAKING OUT.

70
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:49,511
>>

71
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:49,812
.>

72
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:50,946
GREG: WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE

73
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:51,513
PEOPLE?

74
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:54,383
THEY'RE LIKE KIDS WHO ATE ALL OF

75
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,219
THEIR HALLOWEEN CANDY IN ONE

76
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,420
NIGHT.

77
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,588
THEY'RE OVERLOADED.

78
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:03,425
THEY'RE GOING TO END UP WITH A

79
00:03:03,425 --> 00:03:05,160
DTO, DONALD TRUMP OVERDOSE.

80
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,864
CNN HAS HAD STORMY'S LAWYER ON

81
00:03:08,864 --> 00:03:11,100
60 TIMES IN THREE MONTHS.

82
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,634
HE GETS MORE AIR TIME THAT

83
00:03:12,634 --> 00:03:12,968
POLLEN.

84
00:03:12,968 --> 00:03:15,104
>> YOU GOT TO STOP INTERRUPTING

85
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:15,371
ME.

86
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,739
>> THE COVERUP IS THE CON.

87
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,374
>> WHOEVER THE ATTORNEY IS WHO

88
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:20,075
WROTE THOSE TWO TWEETS IS AN

89
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:20,542
ABSOLUTE MORON.

90
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:23,012
>> NO DOUBT HE'S GOING TO FLIP

91
00:03:23,012 --> 00:03:24,513
DISWHR YOU

92
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:24,580
.ISWHR YOU

93
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,047
.>>WHR YOU

94
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:25,080
.>> YR YOU

95
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,414
.>> YOUYOU

96
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:25,447
.>> YOU CU

97
00:03:25,447 --> 00:03:27,082
.>> YOU CAN PUT LIPSTICK ON THE

98
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,084
PIG MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT BUT

99
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,853
IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A PIG.

100
00:03:30,853 --> 00:03:32,554
>> I'M STUNNED.

101
00:03:32,554 --> 00:03:34,556
STILL STUNNED THIS MORNING.

102
00:03:34,556 --> 00:03:35,991
GREG: EVERY DAY HE'S SPEECHLESS

103
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:38,394
WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE HE NEVER

104
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:38,927
SHUTS UP.

105
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,496
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE.

106
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,964
BUT FAIR PLAY TO HIM.

107
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:44,199
HE'S GOT CNN IN HIS BACK POCKET

108
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:50,105
AND HE WON'T STOP FARTING.

109
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,741
I THOUGHT ABOUT TAKING THAT OUT.

110
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,810
NOW REMEMBER WHEN IT WAS ALL

111
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,578
ABOUT COLLUSION.

112
00:03:56,578 --> 00:03:58,514
BUT NOW EVEN MSNBC HAS DOUBTS.

113
00:03:58,514 --> 00:03:59,048
THAT IS GREAT.

114
00:03:59,048 --> 00:04:02,551
>> AS FOR THE MUELLER

115
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,953
INVESTIGATION, I, I AM VERY, AS

116
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,823
AN AMERICAN, A CITIZEN, I'M

117
00:04:07,823 --> 00:04:10,359
FASCINATED TO KNOW WHAT HE

118
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:10,859
FINDS.

119
00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:13,028
I'M NOT, I'M NOT SO SURE THAT

120
00:04:13,028 --> 00:04:15,464
HE'S GOING TO FIND THE SMOKING

121
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,666
GUN OF COORDINATION OR

122
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:19,101
COLLUSION.

123
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:21,503
GREG: OH MY GOD.

124
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:23,672
MSNBC NOT SURE ABOUT COLLUSION?

125
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:25,574
THAT'S LIKE MICHAEL MOORE NOT

126
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:31,914
SURE ABOUT PIE.

127
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:33,682
HE LIKES PIE.

128
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:36,385
CAN'T CHANGE HIS MIND ON PIE.

129
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:39,154
SO IT'S STORMY THIS AND STORMY

130
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,156
THAT FROM PEOPLE WHO USED TO SAY

131
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,891
WHO CARES, IT'S ONLY SEX.

132
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:44,760
THE LESSON, IF YOU LOSE AN

133
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,261
ELECTION, WHY NOT SUE

134
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:46,662
AFTERWARDS.

135
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,865
IT'S THE POLITICAL EQUIVALENT OF

136
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:53,068
TONYA HARDING TAKING OUT NANCY

137
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:53,569
KERRIGAN.

138
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,772
AND THE MEDIA AND THE DEMS ARE

139
00:04:56,772 --> 00:05:03,445
SEAN EBBING

140
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:03,479
SEAN ECKING

141
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:03,512
SEAN ECKERG

142
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,113
SEAN ECKERT.

143
00:05:04,113 --> 00:05:05,714
THE ECHO IS IMPOACH.

144
00:05:05,714 --> 00:05:08,250
THERE ARE NO DEMOCRATIC IDEAS TO

145
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:09,985
COUNTER TRUMP'S SUCCESSES.

146
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:13,255
I MEAN HOW DO THE DEMOCRATS TOP

147
00:05:13,255 --> 00:05:14,756
ENDING THE NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR

148
00:05:14,756 --> 00:05:15,090
THREAT.

149
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,826
WHAT WOULD BE THEIR ISSUES?

150
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:22,364
FREE HEALTH CARE FOR MS-13?

151
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,567
HORSES SHOULD BE ABLE TO MARRY

152
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:25,868
SHEEP?

153
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,936
I'M FOR THAT ACTUALLY.

154
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:29,238
LOVE IS LOVE.

155
00:05:29,238 --> 00:05:30,806
ALL RIGHT.

156
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:33,542
AND SO IN A SPRINT TRUMP MADE

157
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:37,379
THE WORLD BETTER FOR 7.6 BILLION

158
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,848
PEOPLE AND THE QUESTION PLAYING

159
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:42,951
THE MEDIA'S BRAIN, DID A RICH

160
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:46,088
BILLIONAIRE PLAYBOY LIE ABOUT

161
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:46,355
SEX.

162
00:05:46,355 --> 00:05:48,223
I THINK I CAN SAVE THEM A YEAR

163
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:54,530
OF PROGRAMMING TIME AND SAY,

164
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:54,796
YES.

165
00:05:54,796 --> 00:05:57,199
NEXT QUESTION, DOES AMERICA

166
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,233
CARE?

167
00:05:58,367 --> 00:06:01,170
SEE, YOU CAN LOOK AT THIS LATEST

168
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,172
STORMY STUFF TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.

169
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,640
ONE AS A LAWYER.

170
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,575
TRUMP IS ALLOWED TO PAY A

171
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:06,975
SETTLEMENT.

172
00:06:06,975 --> 00:06:09,511
DIDN'T USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS.

173
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,780
OR YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AS A

174
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,783
VOTER, YOU CARE MORE ABOUT PEACE

175
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,586
THAN PORN STARS AND DEEDS MORE

176
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:17,986
THAN WORDS.

177
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:21,190
THAT BRINGS US TO THIS CHOICE,

178
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,093
DO YOU WANT A WHOLESOME

179
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,062
PRESIDENT WHO COULD NEVER HAVE

180
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:28,063
FIGURED OUT NORTH KOREA.

181
00:06:28,063 --> 00:06:29,598
I KNOW THE CHOICE I MADE AND

182
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,469
IT'S THE CHOICE AMERICA MADE

183
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,803
ALREADY.

184
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:37,906
LET US WELCOME TONIGHT'S GUEST.

185
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:41,043
HE'S SMART AND TOUGH LIKE AN

186
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:46,381
ENCYCLOPEDIA THAT CAN KICK YOUR

187
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:51,954
ASS, FOX NEWS

188
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,856
ASS, SOX NEWS

189
00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:54,890
ASS, SEB NEWS

190
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:54,923
