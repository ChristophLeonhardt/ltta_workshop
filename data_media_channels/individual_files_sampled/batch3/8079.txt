Bret: LET'S GET SOME PERSPECTIVE NOW AND INSIDE ARE THE STORIES THAT WE BROUGHT YOU BEFORE THE BREAK. IF THE NORTH KOREA HOSTAGE SETTLEMENTS AND WHAT GAMES COMES NEXT, THE IRAN DEAL AND OTHER STORIES. BRIT HUME JOINS US. YOUR THOUGHTS ON, THIS IS A BIG DEVELOPMENT WITH THESE THREE AMERICANS LANDING TONIGHT OR EARLY THIS MORNING, BUT IT IS SETTING THE TABLE FOR WHAT THE PRESIDENT HOPES WILL BE SOMETHING BIGGER.
