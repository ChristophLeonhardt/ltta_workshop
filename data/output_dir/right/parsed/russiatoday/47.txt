innately while we were elected because
we ran on a platform of ecological and
social transition the model practiced by
this kind of company runs counter to
that we do not endorse that model
or they call the big man big max a Big
Mac but they call it big man
dookey people can eat whatever they want
Who am I to judge but we were elected on
this platform so we have an alternative
to this model
let's go
I think on islands such as ours we
should instead encourage French or local
businesses
there is another way to create jobs plus
if you think about the quality well we
all know the guys well our Lyon is huge
feeble there is this kind of ecological
extremism and play now today McDonald's
means creating more jobs reviving the
town see a scene a new Maserati
