there's one of the stars of Queer Eye for the straight guy I came out and said that not all Republicans are racist I know it's a revelation but this person was destroyed for it so here is what this this fellow had to say about Republicans I'm not advocating for racism I'm definitely not advocating for Donald Trump who sucks but I am saying that from the left if you want to get us into a safer place nationally so that we can have LGBT rights and we can continue having equality then we have to be able to not demonize the right you got shellacked for this right that's exactly right this guy's exactly right it doesn't think like anybody in this room does probably but that's great that he actually is willing to recognize that his career will be over this is the thing you cannot say on the left while the Left claims they want to reach out to all of us they don't actually want to reach out to all of us they prefer to call everybody on this side of the aisle a Nazi and a racist in a terrible person and then castigate us for our immorality it makes it very comfortable for them to push crappy policy you never have to justify your policy if the guy on the other side is a Nazi but this but this person says something good it's just sad to me that this person was attacked for all of it
