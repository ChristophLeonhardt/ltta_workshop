1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:03,536
>> Reporter:  YOU ARE A BIG

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:04,604
SPENDER.

3
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:07,507
>> Neil: $0.75.

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,575
BY THE WAY.

5
00:00:08,575 --> 00:00:11,278
AND THESE ARE NOT PROTESTORS IN

6
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:14,281
IRAN YELLING DEATH TO AMERICA.

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:17,584
THESE ARE HOUSE LEADERS RANTING

8
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,586
ABOUT THE UNITED STATES BACKING

9
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:23,623
AWAY FROM THE DEAL:

10
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,859
AND AMBASSADOR, WHAT DID YOU

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,194
THINK THAT REACTION.

12
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,697
THEY ARE NOT HAPPY?

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:35,468
>> THE IRANIAN LEADERSHIP HAS

14
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,837
BEEN BURNING FLAGS FOR 38 YEARS.

15
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,906
AND THEY TOOK OVER THE EMBASSY

16
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:42,309
WHEN THAT REGIME CAME IN POWER

17
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,944
AND THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

18
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:48,715
BLOWING UP OF YOUR EMBASSIES AND

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,583
BECAUSE OF THEIR ACTIONS THEY

20
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,018
HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE WHO

21
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:53,586
MURDERED HUNDREDS OF AMERICANS

22
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,389
AND SUPPORTED HESBOLLAH IN

23
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,758
BLOWING UP THE MARINE BARRACKS

24
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,460
AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONSTANT

25
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,962
WAR AND THAT IS REALLY NOT NEWS

26
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:03,363
FOR ME.

27
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:07,067
THE BIG NEWS IS THAT PRESIDENT

28
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,102
TRUMP CHANGED THE WHOLE

29
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:11,171
CONJECTORY OF THE MIDDLE EAST.

30
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:14,641
THIS DEAL, NEIL PUT US ON CRUISE

31
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,376
CONTROL AND IT DOESN'T BLOCK

32
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,744
IRAN'S PATH TO THE BOMB.

33
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,145
IT PAVES IT.

34
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,881
AND BY REMOVING THE SANCTIONS ON

35
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:25,852
THE IRANIAN REGIME BILLIONS WERE

36
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,055
POURING IN THE ISRAELI COFFERS.

37
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:33,560
AND THEY WERE FUELLING IT.

38
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,029
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE

39
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,465
PRESIDENT TO STAND UP AND MAKING

40
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,367
THE COURAGEOUS DECISION

41
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:40,767
YESTERDAY.

42
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,436
>> Neil: OTHER FIVE NATIONS

43
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,004
INCLUDING BRITAIN, GERMANY AND

44
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:47,006
FRANCE AND RUSSIA AND CHINA,

45
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,875
THEY ARE GOING TO STICK WITH THE

46
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:50,410
AGREEMENT AS IT STANDS.

47
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,046
THAT MAY BE POSTURING, BUT WHAT

48
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,515
DO YOU THINK, JUST THE UNITED

49
00:01:55,515 --> 00:02:01,421
STATES THAT HAS TO ACT

50
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:01,855
UNLATERALLY.

51
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:05,158
>> I TAKE NOTE YOUR ALLIES AND A

52
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:08,360
ROB WORLD WERE OPPOSED AND WE

53
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,363
PUBLICLY SUPPORTED PRESIDENT

54
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,831
TRUMP'S DECISION AND THAT SHOULD

55
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,166
COUNT FOR SOMETHING.

56
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,834
>> Neil: YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT

57
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:15,168
THAT.

58
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,405
NOT A SINGLE NATION IN THE

59
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,206
MIDDLE EAST SIGNED ON TO THIS.

60
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:24,110
NAND WE WERE THE GUINEA PIGS.

61
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,379
AND IMAGINE THE JAPANESE AND

62
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:30,784
SOUTH KOREANS WERE A POSED TO

63
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,386
THE DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA BUT

64
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,021
GERMANY AND OTHERS WERE HAPPY.

65
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,923
WE WERE TOLD THAT THE REGION

66
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,260
WOULD BE SAFER AND IT MADE THE

67
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,195
REGION MORE DANGEROUS.

68
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,497
IT HAS BROUGHT WAR TO OUR BORDER

69
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,466
AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE NEWS

70
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,568
AND THE ARAB PARTIES ARE

71
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,036
GRATEFUL TO THE NEWS.

72
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,071
AND THE U.S. ECONOMIC PRESSURES,

73
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,207
I DON'T THINK THE GERMAN BANKS

74
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,143
WILL CHOOSE TO DO BUSINESS WITH

75
00:02:57,143 --> 00:02:58,745
IRAN OVER IT IS AMERICAN

76
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:02,048
COMPANIES AND FRENCH WILL NOT DO

77
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,251
BUSINESS WITH IRAN AND NOT

78
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:05,752
UNITED STATES.

79
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:09,823
AND MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO

80
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:10,356
GO THERE.

81
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,226
>> RIGHT NOW, THEY ARE

82
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,928
UNIVERSALLY AGAINST WHAT HE'S

83
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:15,361
DOING.

84
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,230
THAT COULD CHANGE TO YOUR POINT.

85
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,399
WHAT IS GOING ON.

86
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:22,135
OIL PRICES ARE ROCKETING ON THE

87
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,105
BELIEF THAT IT WILL TIGHTEN THE

88
00:03:26,105 --> 00:03:26,473
SUPPLY.

89
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,509
AND THE IRAN OIL, TWO AND HALF

90
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,344
MILLION A DAY X. BEERM RANG ON

91
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:31,744
EVERYONE.

92
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:32,779
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

93
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:36,583
>> YOU KNOW, PRICES ARE RISING

94
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,351
50 PERCENT OVER THE LAST COUPLE

95
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,419
OF YEARS.

96
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,221
THEY HAVE BEEN LOW AND HIDDEN

97
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:44,023
THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS

98
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:44,390
DEAL.

99
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,526
AS OIL PRICES HAVE GONE UP.

100
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,895
AND IF THEY ARE WHERE THEY WERE

101
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,364
3 OR 4 YEARS AGO, MUCH MORE

102
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,466
MONEY WOULD DEPUTY IN THE

103
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,235
IRANIAN COFFERS.

104
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,638
UNDER THE DEAL IRAN COULD SELL

105
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:58,972
OIM.

106
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,274
WHEN THE RESTRICTIONS WERE IN

107
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:03,810
PLACE THEY WERE SELLING

108
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,645
A MILLION BARREL.

109
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,648
AND NOW THEY ARE SELLING 70

110
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,751
BUCKS A BARREL AND 3 MILLION

111
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,485
A MONTH.

112
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,354
AND I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU ALL

113
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:19,659
OF THAT MONEY IS GOING TO FOR

114
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:21,327
THE REVOLUTIONARY GUARD.

115
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:24,998
BUT INSTEAD IT IS FUELLING THE

116
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,332
WAR MACHINE.

117
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,268
AS THEY INCREASE OIL PRODUCTION,

118
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,303
THAT WILL BE DANGEROUS FOR THE

119
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:30,670
REGION.

120
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,605
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR POINT

121
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,808
AND QUESTION, THE SAUDIS AND

122
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,078
OTHERS CAN INCREASE THEIR

123
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:41,648
CAPACITY AND ULTIMATELY SUPPLY

124
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,049
AND DEMAND.

125
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:46,319
YOU CAN CONSTRICT IRAN'S OIL

126
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:46,653
SALES.

127
00:04:46,653 --> 00:00:00,000
AND THAT IS GOOD FOR THE REGION
