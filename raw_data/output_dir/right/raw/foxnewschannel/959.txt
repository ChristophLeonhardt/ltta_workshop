1
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:20,234
HEATHER: NEGOTIATING WITH NORTH

2
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:23,237
KOREA DONALD TRUMP PLEDGING TO

3
00:00:23,237 --> 00:00:23,904
END WARGAMES ON THE KOREAN

4
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:27,474
PENINSULA AS PART OF THE DEAL

5
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:28,175
FOR COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION.

6
00:00:28,175 --> 00:00:28,842
>> WE WILL BE STOPPING THE

7
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:29,543
WARGAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A

8
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:30,277
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY

9
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:34,048
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE

10
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:39,720
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,287
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD.

12
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:41,021
WE WILL BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS

13
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:41,488
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

14
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,060
PLUS I THINK IT IS VERY

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:46,460
PROVOCATIVE.

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,194
HEATHER: SAY THAT COULD BE A

17
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:50,864
DANGEROUS MOVE TO MAKE.

18
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:51,565
GORDON CHANG IS THE AUTHOR OF

19
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:52,266
NUCLEAR SHOWDOWN, NORTH KOREA

20
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:56,870
TAKES OVER THE WORLD AND HE

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,241
JOINS ME.

22
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,376
I ASKED ABOUT THIS THING TO BE

23
00:01:02,376 --> 00:01:04,644
THE ONLY CONCESSION BEING MADE

24
00:01:04,644 --> 00:01:07,147
AT THIS POINT, ADAMANTLY NOT A

25
00:01:07,147 --> 00:01:07,514
GOOD IDEA.

26
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:13,787
>> IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE

27
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:14,521
OUR EXERCISES KEEP US AT A HIGH

28
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,055
STATE OF READINESS.

29
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:21,629
WE NEED TO BE AT THE HIGH STEAK,

30
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:22,196
TO DEFEND SOUTH KOREA.

31
00:01:22,196 --> 00:01:25,165
ALL THIS WILL HE WROTE VERY

32
00:01:25,165 --> 00:01:26,634
QUICKLY.

33
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:31,972
THESE NEGOTIATIONS ON

34
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:32,673
DENUCLEARIZATION TAKE YEARS,

35
00:01:32,673 --> 00:01:34,975
THEN WE COULD HAVE A HOLLOW

36
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,111
FORCE TEMPTING NORTH KOREA TO

37
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,444
INVADE.

38
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:42,783
HEATHER: JUST A PAUSE, DELAYING

39
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:47,221
THEM, SUSPENDING THEM AND THERE

40
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:51,191
HAS ALREADY BEEN ONE THIS YEAR.

41
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,459
>> LOOK AT THESE TWO, WE HAVE

42
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:57,031
TWO SETS OF EXERCISES.

43
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,199
THE IMPORTANT ONE, MEANT TO

44
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:01,335
COINCIDE WITH NORTH KOREA'S

45
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:03,203
TRAINING CYCLE AND A HIGH STATE

46
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,238
OF READINESS WE ARE AT HIGH

47
00:02:04,238 --> 00:02:04,872
STATE OF READINESS, THESE

48
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:11,211
EXERCISES TAKE PLACE IN MARCH,

49
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:11,979
MARCH IS CRITICAL, THAT IS WHAT

50
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:13,881
NORTH KOREA WOULD ATTACK, THE

51
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,215
GROUND WOULD BE FROZEN, GREAT

52
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:21,255
FOR TANKS AND THE SOUTH KOREANS

53
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:21,989
HAVEN'T FLOODED THEIR FIELDS YET

54
00:02:21,989 --> 00:02:23,691
SO THIS IS A GOOD TIME FOR NORTH

55
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:24,425
KOREA TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM IS I

56
00:02:24,425 --> 00:02:26,260
DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP GOT A

57
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,064
COMMITMENT TO END THEIR WINTER

58
00:02:30,064 --> 00:02:30,531
TRAINING CYCLE.

59
00:02:30,531 --> 00:02:33,600
>> THAT WOULD BE THE KEY TO FIND

60
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,636
OUT, IF THEY ARE GOING TO STOP

61
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:38,639
THEIR TRAINING CYCLE.

62
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,076
LISTEN TO WHAT TOM COTTON HAD TO

63
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:42,343
SAY.

64
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:43,210
LISTEN TO HIM.

65
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:50,084
>> WE JUST HAD THE BIGGEST

66
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:50,718
EXERCISE EACH YEAR IN THE

67
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:51,418
SPRING, PROBABLY WON'T HAPPEN

68
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,086
FOR ANOTHER 10 MONTHS UNTIL

69
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:52,553
SPRING OF 2019.

70
00:02:52,553 --> 00:02:56,323
WE WILL HAVE A PRETTY GOOD READ

71
00:02:56,323 --> 00:03:01,428
ON WHETHER KIM JONG UN WILL KEEP

72
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:01,895
HIS COMMITMENT.

73
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:03,564
SECRETARY MATTIS SUPPORTS THE

74
00:03:03,564 --> 00:03:09,269
DECISION, REGULAR EVERYDAY

75
00:03:09,403 --> 00:03:12,873
>> DURING THE YEAR YOU DO HAVE A

76
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:23,150
LEVEL OF TRAINING,

77
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:23,617
>> DURING THE YEAR YOU DO HAVE A
LEVEL OF TRAINING, AND EXERCISES

78
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:24,418
THAT COINCIDE WITH WHEN THE

79
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:24,918
NORTH KOREANS DO.

80
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:25,652
EVEN IF NORTH KOREA DIDN'T HAVE

81
00:03:25,652 --> 00:03:26,387
NUKES THEY STILL HAVE CHEMICAL

82
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:27,087
AND BIOLOGICAL AGENTS, STILL

83
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:27,721
HAVE AN ESTIMATED 14,300

84
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:33,260
ARTILLERY TUBES NORTH OF THE

85
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,894
DEMILITARIZED ZONE WHICH

86
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:34,628
SEPARATES THE TWO CORREIAS AND

87
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:35,863
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE, NORTH

88
00:03:35,863 --> 00:03:44,805
KOREA'S FORCES, 70% ARE DEPLOYED

89
00:03:44,805 --> 00:03:45,439
ON THE DMZ BELOW THE LINE.

90
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,140
THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE IF WE

91
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,207
SUSPEND OUR EXERCISES, NORTH

92
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:49,309
KOREA HAS TO MAKE A

93
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:50,043
CORRESPONDING COMMITMENT TO PULL

94
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:50,344
BACK.

95
00:03:50,344 --> 00:03:55,115
>> WE HAVE CONTINUING MEETINGS

96
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:55,649
GOING ON NEXT WEEK.

97
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,418
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IN TERMS OF

98
00:03:57,418 --> 00:03:57,951
STEPS FOR DIPLOMACY?

99
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:01,488
>> DONALD TRUMP IS DOING THE

100
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:01,889
RIGHT THING.

101
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:08,595
WE HAVE SECRETARY OF STATE

102
00:04:08,595 --> 00:04:09,329
POMPEO TO EXPLAIN WHAT OCCURRED,

103
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,063
WE NEED TO COORDINATE WITH OUR

104
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:18,839
ALLIES.

105
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,572
DONALD TRUMP DID NOT WASTE TIME

106
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:20,274
AND THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY TO

107
00:04:20,274 --> 00:04:21,007
PROCEED AND POMPEO AND NATIONAL

108
00:04:21,007 --> 00:04:21,708
SECURITY ADVISER JOHN BOLTON

109
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,342
TALKING WITH NORTH KOREAN

110
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:26,747
OFFICIALS AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK

111
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:27,481
SO DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT, THIS

112
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:28,081
IS GOT TO OCCUR QUICKLY.

113
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,951
HEATHER: TERMS OF EVERYTHING

114
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:32,119
LAID OUT BEFORE KEY PRIORITIES,

115
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:37,124
THE INITIAL JOINT DOCUMENT, NOT

116
00:04:37,124 --> 00:04:39,526
ENOUGH DETAILS AT THIS POINT.

117
00:04:39,526 --> 00:04:43,397
WE ARE LOOKING AT A PRELIMINARY

118
00:04:43,397 --> 00:04:44,965
DOCUMENT AND PEOPLE CRITICIZE IT

119
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:52,439
AND DEFEND IT.

120
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:53,173
WE WON'T KNOW IF THESE PROCEED

121
00:04:53,173 --> 00:04:53,874
AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY ARE.

122
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:54,575
WE KNOW THE NORTH KOREANS ARE

123
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:56,477
DECLARING THIS TO BE A VICTORY

124
00:04:56,477 --> 00:04:58,111
FOR THEMSELVES, PROPAGANDA IS

125
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:58,846
VERY CORROSIVE AND UNDERCUTS OUR

126
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:08,956
MESSAGE

127
00:05:12,793 --> 00:00:00,000
VERY CORROSIVE AND UNDERCUTS OUR
MESSAGE THEY WANT TO GIVE UP THE
