AS THE HURRICANE WAS BEARING
DOWN ON FLORIDA, A FACEBOOK POST
WENT UP EARLY ON ñ IT DESCRIBED
ITSELF ñ IT WAS A FACEBOOK
POST ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO SHOOT
INTO THE HURRICANE.
THEY ARE NUTS.
WE WILL GET INTO WHETHER IT WAS
SARCASM OR NOT BUT LET ME
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF HOW MANY
PEOPLE LIKED THAT IDEA.
IT GOT SO CRAZY AND SO POPULAR
THAT THE LOCAL SHERIFF HAD TO
PUT OUT A TWEET SAYING DON'T
SHOOT AT THE HURRICANE.
HERE IS THAT TWEET.
IT EXPLAINS HOW IF YOU SHOOT A
BULLET INTO A HURRICANE IT COULD
SWIRL AROUND AND COME BACK AND
HIT YOU.
I LIKE THE RIFLE IN THE CORNER.
IS SHOWING YOU IF YOU FIRE IT
SOMETIMES WILL COME BACK AROUND.
THERE ARE A LOT OF GROUPS
INCLUDING TERRORIST GROUPS
THAT LIKE TO CELEBRATE BY
SHOOTING GUNS IN THE AIR.
THEY ALSO DON'T TAKE GRAVITY
INTO ACCOUNT.
SHOOTING INTO A HURRICANE IS A
DISASTROUS IDEA.
BUT IT IS UNIQUELY AMERICAN.
RYAN EDWARDS, THE GUY THAT PUT
UP THE POST LATER 
SAID THIS.
LET'S TAKE RYAN AT HIS WORD.
THE WAY HE PHRASED IT, IT DID
SEEM LIKE SARCASM.
OF THE 50,000 PEOPLE WHO LIKED
IT I'M SURE A LOT OF THEM ñ
OBVIOUSLY THE SHERIFF WAS
CONCERNED ENOUGH TO PUT UP
A PUBLIC NOTICE SAYING YOU
SHOULD NOT DO IT.
IT REMINDS ME OF THE SIGN I SAW
ON THE HIGHWAY IN MIAMI
THAT SAID DON'T STOP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY.
IF YOU HAVE TO CLARIFY THAT WE
ARE ALREADY IN A BIT OF TROUBLE.
ONLY IN AMERICA DO YOU HAVE TO
REMIND PEOPLE DO NOT SHOOT
AT THE HURRICANE.
