our Brazil played better today than I've seen them in the whole tournament and ironically they go out on that performance I thought defensively you know they're very unlucky on the first goal it's just got a little flick of company which then hit see I'm a fan and Daniel goes in and it's what happens in football and they didn't really recover from that and then they find themselves to nail down at halftime um but I have to say you know it's we're saying goodbye to to one of the better teams now where you can think some of the other teams that were still in the tournament maybe you know when you'd swap them all but that's the nature of the World Cup and I thought the second half they did well I wanted them to in the last 10 minutes to push it a little bit more and they did with the goal the goal was fantastic they went you know it was a ball into the box from from Coutinho and out to Agosto who would just come on it's been on the pitch for three minutes scored and then again two minutes later he had another chance that everyone thought that that ball was in and it just sneaked outside the post and so TD changed it a little bit he took a couple heads ooh his loose off put Douglas Custer on he took Paolini off and put the Agosto on and Willian came on and it came off at half-time for me new came on and oh Gusteau's because I had a real impact he was causing all sorts of problems all three substitutions worked so so most of what happened good that happened in the second half was they were involved we look to Nima to say you know this is your opportunity to show how good you are he had little sniffs he had there there's a situation where he gets a ball on the left hand side he passes it inside the box to Femina Femina has a shot it goes just just over and named I also had a shot in there in 90 minutes plus 3 which Thibaut Courtois say fantastically and but other than that he was not he was not be that they're dominating figuring this you know do you think we're seeing how good Belgium really are now because it was difficult sort of to gauge before given who they played against I mean that paid England but that was sort of like a friendly inverted commas but then they played Japan and people may thought they made heavy weather of that and it was quite hard to work out actually how good they are yeah but I think what Belgium is it's a team it's a proper football team it's well-constructed it's well setup Roberto Martinez he's got options he can change it tactically he can change personnel but what they also have is individual players who can change game even has I in the last 15 minutes what Bertram did obviously they defended him every time they had the ball were looking for him and he can keep the ball for 5 10 15 seconds which is so helpful if you're under the pressure from from a team like Brazil we got Haase Fellaini for me was today incredible you know it's his big strong awkward he can run he a lot of people they look at Fellini and they see something different or someone they can't believe that he's like that but technically he's very good unless you know he came on the other day change the game chappy today was what was fantastic Kevin de Bruyne yeah I mean the last five minutes he could hardly walk that's how much he did he'd work so they've got all these incredible individuals individually skilled players who every single one of them can change the game Lukaku again today worked really hard it didn't really it didn't come up for him he didn't score but work so hard for the team it was all over the place at times he was running down the wing I mean most people remember hearing more seam as a centre forward but it's like a winger it's on so this is what I mean it's a team and and and that that makes a very big difference to having you know 11 individual players who all wants to go out there and and and there and you know get get the limelight so you have match winners in this team's so I mentioned Courtois that's saving the last minute all not even in the last minute it was in the 93rd minute so 90 plus 3 and that was five minutes added on that say it was fantastic and this is what they have they have guys who can change the outcome of the game and that that for me is more valuable that having you know the biggest football stars in the world you
