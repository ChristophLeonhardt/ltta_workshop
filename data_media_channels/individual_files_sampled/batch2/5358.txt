joining me now the author of unhinged at insiders account of the Trump White House Omarosa Manigault Newman Omarosa thank you so much for joining us you've been through this where he's attacked you and caught you name so I think we might have a shared experience let's talk about the NDA the Trump campaign has smiled arbitration against you do you believe you violated your 2016 agreement yeah I don't believe that I violate it but I'm gonna leave that to the lawyers to sort that out it's interesting that he's trying to silence me so what is he trying to hide what is he afraid of if he hadn't said anything that was derogatory or demeaning to african-americans and women why would he go to this extent to try to shut me should be should he be afraid of more tapes that you have in your possession I think he should be afraid of being exposed as the misogynist the big and the racist that he is do you have more tapes of the president I am NOT going to comment on that are you gonna release more tapes I'm not gonna comment on that let's talk about something you you talked to Chris Matthews about last night the Muller investigation have you been interviewed by the Special Counsel I have you have it and what sort of questions were they asking yes the extent I can go and discussing that as well I feel like my hands are tied because as you know I do have love to communicate about the things that are going on in my life but unfortunately I can't elaborate have you sat for a grand jury I'm not gonna be able to comment about that I don't want this whole thing to be up not being able to comment about that but I'd be happy to talk about unhinged my book that's out today well you did say to Chris Matthews that you have more tapes that Robert Muller could be interested in he might want to call you again what sort of tapes would he be interested in you know if he calls me I certainly will participate with anything that he needs I'll provide him what he needs but that's the extent that I can talk about but you said he's interested that's that's dangling something can you give us a little bit more that's information say this that there's a lot of corruption that went on both in the campaign and in the White House and I'm gonna blow the whistle on all of it I'm very interested in exposing what was happening too high in the scenes and while as you saw with Katrina Campins statement she really I mean Katrina Pierson statement she really lied one day and then she turned around and like the next day that's really the pattern of this organization you say have a problem with the truth do you say you say corruption but do you mean coordination anything that we albert Mohler would be interested in whether donald trump was coordinating with russia or he knew about the emails during the campaign that sort of thing I think that he should come clean with the American people I think that he should be honest about what he did during the campaign and what he continued to do in the White House you were instructed according to your book to bring up the emails at every point you could at the end of the 20 2016 Hillary Clinton's email yes that was our talker did Donald Trump know about those emails before they came out absolutely he knew about them yes he knew what was coming out before WikiLeaks released them you're saying Donald Trump had a back-channel I didn't say that you did but I will say that how I am going to most the corruption that went on in the campaign and in the White House I'm gonna continue to blow the whistle on all of us how did he know about those emails if he knew about them before they came out how did he know you know they're gonna have a press briefing at 2:30 I'm sure you can have your correspondent as saira that a question you would ask absolutely I would ask a lot of questions I would ask him why during this weekend the anniversary of Charlottesville he sent such a small tweet but he spent all day tweeting about me he could have condemned in a much stronger term in a clearer term that he is not a racist but he squandered that opportunity I think that there are a lot of things that the president should come clean about were you ever asked about Roger stone no I was not did you have any communication with Roger stack did not could Roger stone have been somebody that told Donald Trump about emails I think that Roger stone right now is being investigated and bright rightfully so he has been one of those dark shady characters in Trump world for a very long time and I think that they have their sights set properly on him how worried are folks in the White House staffers about this investigation the Moller investigation they should be very worried are they worried absolutely what are they because they have been hiding things hiding things from the American people and being very dishonest staffers have been hiding things absolutely like what I can't go into it you know Katie I'm very happy to talk about what's in the book which is why you invited me here and then we're being a bit of a whistleblower as well I'm not being evasive there's 368 wonderful pages of things that I talked about about my interesting journey for 15 years with Donald Trump I'm here with you you could ask me anything from unhinged that's out today show me if I'm wrong a whistle-blower for this administration you're saying that you want to expose Donald Trump for who he is in the corruption yes that he's perpetrated and so you know what is vast of worth ale and it's not sitting here with you it's not no there's a process for that there is also a legal process for that but that's not going to happen here in the next three minutes that we have left feel free to ask me anything about unhinge you also talked about conversations you have with Jared navona in this book are they concerned about the Moller investigation I'm not certain you'll have to ask Jared in Ivanka the president called you a dog this morning what's your reaction I think that it just shows you that if he would say that publicly what else would he say about me privately he has absolutely no respect for women for african-americans as evidenced by him instructing the chief of staff to lock me for two hours in the Situation Room to harass me to threaten me and say that things could get very ugly for me and that there would be damage to my reputation but he is unfit to be in this office and to serve as a president let's put up the tweet that he sent out when you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn't work out good work by general Kelly for quickly firing that dog we've noted that he's used a derogatory language about women a number of times in the past especially on Twitter dog women and minorities dog dumb dumbest man on television he said that the other day low IQ blood coming out of her wherever neurotic ingrates Miss Piggy's son of a B word fat ugly slob this is on Twitter and in interviews when you were in the White House did you see him treat women in a derogatory way you know there were often and I comment about this and unhinged about all of the different names that he had for everyone he would talk about you in fact Katie I was on the campaign while he harassed and talked about you and wanted to get you kicked out of things he talked about all of the people around him if you were in the room with him you leave the room for instance he would call Betsy DeVos bitsy DeVos when General when General Kelly left the room he had a for him anybody that was in his world because of his small ability to communicate he would give them these derogatory nicknames and it just wasn't appropriate it wasn't about women specifically or minorities specifically or was it everybody well did he treat women differently he does treat women differently I think as evidenced by the lack of female appointees in his administration the lack of high-level senior advisors women in his administration and throughout all of the different agencies he treats them different because he believes that they're beneath him can you detail any moment in the White House where he he treated a woman in a different way or he harass women was there any inappropriate language used about women to their faiths did he comment on appearances or looks any moment that you can describe for us one of the things that I talked about that just raised such great concern for me it was his attacks on the widow of the soldier who died in Nigeria as well as the congresswoman congresswoman Wilson when he started to attack her and then general Kelly got in on the act they were tag-teaming by attacking these african-american women who in their right mind would attack a woman who just lost her husband on the front line of serving for this country that's exactly it he is not in his right mind he is mentally impaired and unfit to serve as president you write in the book Trump has an affinity for pretty women he'd rather have a pretty woman with no experience around gonna qualify that less attractive woman you're talking about hope it's there yes I am talking about hope it's I find it very interesting you know people say interesting things about me but hope Hicks who had a relationship with a married man Corey Lewandowski that's been well-documented no pics that continue to have relationships that they were all denied that we should point out okay and then she had a relationship with Brockport or a man who is alleged to have been beaten his both of his wives and this is the person that he brought into the White House to be a communicator for him and I just think that it's interesting that people haven't really examined the fact that he rather have someone who has absolutely no political experience and has no knowledge of politics at all because she's pretty and I'm someone who served in two tours of duty this is my second time in the White House and he calls me a dog did you feel like you were harassed by him in the White House for being a woman harassed in a sexual way at any point did he harass anyone in a sexual way any meet two moments I don't know that I would characterize them as me two but I saw in your book for instance where he grabs you and he kissed you without you welcoming that he did that very often with women anytime he wanted he's very physical he would grab women kiss them unsolicited anytime any day you also write about the National Enquirer in this book and the president's relationship with David pecker and how he helped convince you to drop a lawsuit that you were going to file am i against an ami did Donald Trump talk directly to David pecker we actually all talked on a conference call together you know he called me to tell me that he learned about the lawsuit after the murder of my brother that I had against the Enquirer and that David Packer was a really good close friend of his and that he thought we should work it out outside of court because he didn't want to see any harm to David pecker he was persistent in making sure that I negotiated a deal with him and because I respect it I mean he's my mentor he's saying that David pecker is his friend ultimately as you'll see an unhinged I would go on to work for AMI in exchange for not filing a lawsuit against them so Donald Trump directly talked to David pecker this is also something that's come up with Karen McDougal and stormy Daniels in your experience is is this Donald is it Michael Cohen acting as the go-between here or is Donald Trump picking up the phone and getting a friend of his to quash negative stories about him Donald Trump called David pecker and myself directly I want to talk about Puerto Rico because you also talk about that in your book you said that Donald Trump used a derogatory term for Puerto Rico and so did John Kelly and that John Kelly was blaming Puerto Rico saying that they are using the hurricane in order to get the government to fix the power grid what exactly was a derogatory term well first of all I want to leave something to the imagination for people in the book but I want to talk about in broader terms their lack of action in Puerto Rico Tom Bossard who was the incredible person inside actually trying to get things done to get a to Puerto Rico was shut down at every single turn he tried to get the finances he tried to get food he tried to get resources john kelly was slow to acts and slow to okay things and it just baffled me why they worked so quickly to get resources to florida after the hurricane to get resources to texas and yet they allowed the people of Puerto Rico to suffer in fact the condition of Puerto Rico right now is a direct result of lack of inaction by John Kelly and it's not for Tom bass or trying it's because he blocked them widely derogatory terms of the imagination we've already heard about s whole countries can you tell us what the term was I think that you will see in the book a lot of the derogatory terms doesn't name the derogatory term from were taco because I have had to outline all of these disgusting things that he said and I think that he'll have to answer to the American people exactly what he said and how he said it unfortunately those particular words know what and said and how he said it has fortunately those remarks were stated actually in a sensitive environment and I've always been very sensitive okay I've always were getting a last question apparently yeah that's my husband I'm sorry your husband I didn't yeah we're a little but when there's sensitivity I had to not be explicit particularly sensitivity to the classification but yeah he said those things I'm just one last question and then I'll let you go and this is because this keeps coming up there's the the issue of the credibility thing and it's just it's just not going away so I want to give you a chance well I think this to say to the American public why they should believe you and believe what's written in this book anything that you see that's in this book but to do that's in quotes can be cooperated it's verified and well document at 15 years of knowing Donald Trump and seeing his behavior this is an insider look into Trump world is it on tape you've heard all the you've heard a lot of them trust me I have every single thing in this book I have verified and document it and it'll be an interesting look for people oh moriss Amana got Newman thank you so much for joining us we
