the American president has apparently agreed to stop supplying weapons to Kurdish fighters who are currently battling Islamic state in Syria Turkey's foreign minister says Trump made the pledge in a phone call to his country's leader we're saying something mr. Trump clearly stated that he had given clear instructions not to provide the YPG with arms and that this nonsense should have ended long ago but the White House was less forthcoming about the conversation it confirmed the call took place but did not mention the Kurds it simply said Donald Trump informed President Erdogan about upcoming adjustments to the military support being provided to America's partners on the ground in Syria however whether those adjustments will affect Washington's support for the courage wasn't made explicit well the US has been sending various types of weaponry to Kurdish forces and supporting their military operations with a number of strikes but it's been a major sticking point between America and Turkey which considers some Kurdish forces to be terrorists well for more on this let's now cross 2 journalists and Kurdish affairs unless he was awesome and hello he would good to have your company what would be the significance of the u.s. ending its support for Kurdish forces in your view well it will be it will mean the end of the Kurdish Enclave in in in that in in northern Syria but at the same time it will not come as a surprise to many of us u.s. policy has always been one of four the status quo of the existing countries the Kurds have been wishfully hoping for the support or the thought that the United States can become an ally with them away from the capital of capitals of the countries that they ligant any Iraqi Kurdistan the situation was very clear in in Syrian Kurdistan it will become it's only a matter of time for the u.s. support to stop and this this will mean the end of the force that fought Isis all along the effective for that that fought Isis and it will free turkey to to come and attack the YPG or attack or bump the various bases it seems that I mean states are a lot more important than people or governments are more important than people for for the United States of America this has been their policy all along and it's it does not really come as a surprise to many analysts at this point in time is it a surprise though is it know that ISIL is defeated or but in Syria that the u.s. simply wants to get turkey onside I think this is it I think the the International Coalition or the coalition that the United States has put together the purpose of it was just to end ISIL and the Kurds proved to be a very good fighting force in this and they have finished with them then now they can pack up and go that they this is this has been the situation in Iraq you understand it was exactly the same the Kurds were an effective force on the ground in the fight against ISIL when I so disappeared they were dropped like hot potatoes the same situation in there in the Syrian Kurdistan will be repeated I believe unless an international player like Russia or or Europe intervenes I don't think the United States will have any will will hesitate to leave the Kurds of Syria for Turkey or the PYD or YPG or whoever else who fought with them the policy the American policy has been one of taxi policy with various prayer groups in this area if you are it's now clear that if you are a friend of the United States or an ally of the United States and any minute you are drop like hot potato but if you are an ally or a friend of Iran or there or Russia or any of these other countries they stick by you to the end and this is something that America does not do and the Kurds specifically are not do not seem to be learning this lesson from history on the situation now in Syria how do you think this is going to affect the dynamic in the country well it will mean that it will embolden the the other forces the the more radical and the Islamic forces although Isis has gone but the the opposition forces are not that much better in terms of the Kurdish rights and many of them many of Kurds I hear anyway they with the current status of place some even prefer the the Syrian regime the the the government of Assad to some of those people in the opposition forces at least the Assad regime is clear on what he wants and what he doesn't want with the city and with a lot of the Syrian opposition forces they are not even willing to admit the presence of the Kurds their relationship with the Kurds is one of secondhand second-class citizen and this is not going to this is it will only embolden the anti-democratic forces in Syria and it will crush the Kurds though those who fought with the United States of America we appreciate your take on the matter longtime expert on all things Kurdistan and Iraq journalist and political analyst Heba Osman
