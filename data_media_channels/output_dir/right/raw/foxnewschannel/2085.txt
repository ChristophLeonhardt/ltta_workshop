SEAT IN A STATE THAT PRESIDENT

3
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:09,751
TRUMP WON.

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,986
MIKE GIBBONS ON THIS TRAIL

5
00:00:11,986 --> 00:00:13,187
ASKING FOR THE VOTE OF

THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

9
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:18,693
>> THANKS, LELAND.

10
00:00:18,693 --> 00:00:19,827
LELAND: WHEN I WATCHED THE

11
00:00:19,827 --> 00:00:20,795
INTERVIEW AND OTHER CANDIDATES

12
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:23,264
IN THE RACE AND I'VE READ SOME

13
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:24,465
OF YOUR COMMENTS, WHAT STRIKES

14
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:26,868
ME IS THAT EVERYONE IS TRYING TO

15
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:29,904
WRAP THEMSELVES IN THE I AM MORE

16
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,139
TRUMP THAN THE NEXT GUY, I'M

17
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,941
MORE OF AN OUTSIDER THAN THE

18
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:35,443
NEXT GUY.

19
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:37,679
WHY IS THAT MESSAGE SO IMPORTANT

20
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:38,413
IN OHIO?

21
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,415
>> I'VE TRAVELED THE 88 COUNTIES

22
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,518
IN THIS STATE AND THE ONE LINE

23
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:45,420
THAT I GIVE THAT ALWAYS GETS

24
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,422
APPLAUSE IS I'M NOT A

25
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,022
POLITICIAN.

26
00:00:48,022 --> 00:00:50,258
I'VE NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE

27
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:50,625
BEFORE.

28
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,193
I'M TIRED OF THE CAREER

29
00:00:52,193 --> 00:00:52,827
POLITICIANS WE HAVE IN

30
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:54,162
WASHINGTON AND THAT'S WHY I'M

31
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:54,495
RUNNING.

32
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:55,763
LELAND: THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

33
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:56,297
RUNNING.

34
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:57,231
HOW DOES IT -- WHY DO YOU THINK

35
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:57,999
THAT RESONATES?

36
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,100
>> I THINK THAT EVERYBODY ELSE

37
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,903
IS TIRED OF THEM, ALSO, AND I

38
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:03,738
MEAN, YOU KNOW, I THINK I'VE GOT

39
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:04,272
THE OPINION--

40
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,506
MY OWN OPINION IS THE OPINION OF

41
00:01:05,506 --> 00:01:07,308
MOST PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF

42
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:07,608
OHIO.

43
00:01:07,608 --> 00:01:12,347
LELAND: IS THE ARGUMENT ON THE

44
00:01:12,347 --> 00:01:15,416
FLIP SIDE, IN ORDER TO SOMETIMES

45
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:17,118
CHANGE SOMETHING THAT IS AS

46
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,519
PROFOUNDLY SCREWED UP AS

47
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,687
WASHINGTON IS AND THERE'S PRETTY

48
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:22,957
MUCH AGREEMENT ON THAT FACT, YOU

49
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,294
HAVE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT HOW IT

50
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,796
WORKS AND IN A WAY, PRESIDENT

51
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,298
TRUMP HAS LEARNED THAT HIMSELF

52
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,032
IN 18 MONTHS.

53
00:01:31,032 --> 00:01:32,033
>> HE'S RUN MONTH.

54
00:01:32,033 --> 00:01:33,067
I THINK WE HAVE TO CHANGE THE

55
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,936
ROSTER IN THE U.S. SENATE, HAVE

56
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:36,104
MORE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T TRYING TO

57
00:01:36,104 --> 00:01:37,605
KEEP THE SYSTEM THEY'RE USING

58
00:01:37,605 --> 00:01:38,806
RIGHT NOW IN PLACE.

59
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:40,274
IN EVERYBODY'S PUSHING TO KEEP

60
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:41,542
POWER AND THEY'RE ALL WORKING

61
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,478
WITH EACH OTHER, WHICH IS THE

62
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,847
CASE IN MY ELECTION HERE, YOU'RE

63
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:47,548
NEVER GOING TO CHANGE IT.

64
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:49,016
LELAND: IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT

65
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:52,353
THE PRESIDENT, WHO IS THE

66
00:01:52,353 --> 00:01:53,721
NON-POLITICIAN POLITICIAN HAS

67
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,923
ENDORSED SOMEBODY WHO IS A

68
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:59,394
POLITICIAN IN THIS RACE, THAT'S

69
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:01,963
CONGRESSMAN RENACCI, WHO IS WITH

00:02:01,963 --> 00:02:03,431
THE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW AND HERE

71
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:06,734
IS HIS INTERVIEW YESTERDAY WITH

72
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,502
BILL HEMMER.

73
00:02:08,502 --> 00:02:10,405
>> MIKE GIBBONS AND OTHERS

74
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:11,372
RUNNING IN THIS RACE WANT TO

75
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:13,207
TALK ABOUT THE OUTSIDER AND THEY

76
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:15,810
WANT TO SAY I'M THE INSIDER,

77
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,445
THEY'RE THE 0 OUTSIDER.

78
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:20,181

MY 30 YEARS OF BUSINESS

81
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:22,750
EXPERIENCE TO WASHINGTON.

82
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,419
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT

83
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,553
LIKES, AND I ALSO KNOW THAT'S

84
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:26,954
WHAT THE PEOPLE LIKE, AND I DO

85
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:29,290
HAVE NOW A COUPLE OF YEARS IN

86
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,625
THE HOUSE TO UNDERSTAND HOW

87
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:32,126
WASHINGTON IS BROKEN TO GET A

88
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:34,328
HEAD START ON IT IN THE SENATE.

89
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:35,596
LELAND: ALL RIGHT.

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,268
POLITICIAN.

93
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:41,569
LELAND: BUT I SAW YOU LAUGHING

94
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:42,103
DURING THAT CLIP.

95
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:44,372
>> WELL, HE WAS A LOBBYIST

96
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,606
BEFORE HE RAN FOR CONGRESS.

97
00:02:45,606 --> 00:02:48,042
HE'S BEEN IN FOUR TERMS IN THE

98
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,610
16TH DISTRICT, CONGRESSIONAL

99
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,512

100
00:02:51,512 --> 00:02:52,513
HE IS--

101
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:53,781
HE HAS RUN FOR THREE OFFICES IN

102
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:54,782
THE LAST TWO YEARS.

103
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,350
HE STARTED RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR.

104
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,587
AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW, THE

105
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,556
NARRATIVE IS THAT PRESIDENT

106
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,790
TRUMP CHOSE HIM.

107
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,460
MITCH MCCONNELL RECRUITED HIM,

108
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,528
CONTRIBUTES TO HIS CAMPAIGN AND

109
00:03:07,528 --> 00:03:09,831
ARRANGED FOR THE PRESIDENT TO

110
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:10,932
SUPPORT HIM.

111
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,166
I WAS DONALD TRUMP'S FUND

112
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,468
RAISING CO-CHAIRMAN IN THIS

113
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:19,040
STATE, GAVE HIM THE LARGEST

114
00:03:19,173 --> 00:03:21,242
GIVEN TO A CANDIDATE.

115
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,478
AND HE OFFERED ME A JOB IN THE

116
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:23,978
ADMINISTRATION.

117
00:03:23,978 --> 00:03:27,148
AND MADE 800 CALLS FOR HIM AND

118
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:30,918
HE THINK HITS AGENDA IS

119
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,053
IMPORTANT AND I STILL DO.

120
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:35,823
LELAND: HOW ABOUT THE AGENDA--

121
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:37,825

00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,428
>> AS THE COUNTRY GOES, OHIO

124
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:40,761
GOES.

125
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:42,430
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD EIGHT YEARS

126
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,899
OF A PRESIDENT THAT MADE EVERY

127
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,200
SMALL BUSINESS MAN IN THIS

128
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,035
COUNTRY FEEL UNWORTHY.

129
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:49,537
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T DO IT ON YOUR

130
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:50,104
OWN.

131
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,673
I'M A GUY WHO STARTED A BUSINESS

132
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:54,342
28 YEARS AGO AND REMEMBER THE 20

133
00:03:54,342 --> 00:03:55,877
HOUR DAYS AND I STILL HAVE THEM

134
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:57,345

00:03:58,946 --> 00:04:00,014
ACCOMPLISHED ANYTHING, MADE ME

137
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:01,516
FEEL LIKE WHAT I HAD DONE WAS

138
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,885
REALLY JUST, OTHER PEOPLE DOING

139
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:04,886
IT.

140
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,153
DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT

141
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:07,355
TAKES TO RUN A BUSINESS, TO

142
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:09,257
START A BUSINESS AND WHETHER THE

143
00:04:09,257 --> 00:04:09,657

MATTER YOU UNDERSTAND THOUGH

146
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,729

00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:24,472
BE THE ONLY SENATOR THAT CAN

153
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:25,640
FINISH A DRIVEWAY IF I GET

154
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,973
