we have just gotten the first reaction
to president Trump's criticisms of NFL
players who protest the national anthem
you're looking at this video from just
moments ago a number of players from the
Baltimore Ravens and the Jacksonville
Jaguars playing at Wembley Stadium in
London taking the knee as this first NFL
game begins this Sunday more players
than normally would be taking any are
doing so in an apparent direct response
and reaction to President Trump's
criticism and call for a boycott of the
NFL at least a suggestion of that
