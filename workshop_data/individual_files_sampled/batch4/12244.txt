Hillary Clinton has finally taken personal responsibility for all the things that caused her to lose the election through no fault of her own in various interviews and speeches mrs. Clinton has blamed her loss on James Comey the Russians the Democrat Party voter suppression the media the weather a guy at a gas station who gave her directions to Arizona when she asked the way to Wisconsin and the fact that Satan promised he would make her president if she would give him her immortal soul and then lied to her and pulled the prize away at the last minute actually I'm not sure that last one is really a very good excuse anyway according to her report on the website Axios Hillary's friends say she is quote seething with rage and haunted by her loss now far be it from me to revel in mrs. Clinton's personal pain or celebrate her agonizing comeuppance or dance around the room singing a happy happy song at the news that she's suffering nor would I ever wear a red clown nose and make funny faces in the bathroom mirror upon hearing that she had been plunged into a personal hell because her lifelong corruption failed to pay off that would be wrong especially wearing the clown nose but you never happened or if it did I regret it in any case claims rage is apparently left her a bit confused for instance in a recent commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley University mrs. Clinton said she was as furious about the election of Donald Trump as she had been furious at Richard Nixon when he was impeached but in fact Richard Nixon wasn't impeached that was mrs. Clinton's husband bill so which one of these two presidents is she actually furious at it's hard to tell especially since mrs. Clinton made the speech while wearing a beret that looked remarkably similar to the beret once worn by Bill Clinton's mistress Monica Lewinsky although maybe that was a gesture of thanks to Miss Lewinsky for taking care of bills personal needs leaving mrs. Clinton more free time in which to plot her lifelong run for the presidency which ultimately failed leaving her furious and miserable which is not something I would revel in or celebrate or sing happy happy songs over mrs. clinton's estrangement from the facts was further on display and an interview she gave to new york magazine in which he claimed to have beaten both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump while it is true that with all the power of the Democrat Party machine conspiring to help her mrs. Clinton was able to eke out a primary victory over the 75 year old communists Sanders the evidence suggests she actually lost a trump in the presidential election the evidence being the fact that Trump is president she's not in short mrs. Clinton has still not come to terms with what we like to call reality because it's reality perhaps this explains receiving rage and unhappiness which in turn would explain why I was wearing a red clown nose if I had been which of course I wasn't trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan and this is the Andrew Clavin show
