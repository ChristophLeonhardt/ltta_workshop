Paul Mount afford and his business associate rick gates indicted i'm gonna tell you why i couldn't care less and why this won't affect president donald trump even one little bit Paul Manafort and his business associate Rick gates surrendered to federal authorities this morning in Washington DC now we know that Bob Muller's camp I believe it was Robert Muller the Special Counsel himself but his camp leaked news of the indictment to CNN on Friday evening now of course the Democrats the never Trump errs the progressives work we're just giddy all weekend they imagine Donald Trump II and holed out of the White House in handcuffs they thought it was gonna be general Flynn they thought it was gonna be Donald Trump jr. they thought it was gonna be somebody close to the president but many of us in media did what we do and we tapped our sources and my sources and federal law enforcement said to a person it's manna fort and probably on farah violations foreign agent Registration Act violations well my source is right as were the sources of many others we found out this morning there was a 12 count federal indictment against Manta Ford in gates on charges ranging from conspiracy against the United States to making false statements to investigators the crux of it really is far legal wire transfers basically what's being alleged in a nutshell is Paul Manafort hid money that he earned from foreign governments a little more intricate than that the indictment is up on the Department of Justice's website you can read it but this segment is an about Paul Manafort I personally never liked Paul Manafort if Paul Matta Ford did these things then he has to answer for these things Paul Manafort was always the wrong guy to run Donald Trump's campaign and luckily it was only for a few months he wanted Trump to tone down the style that saw Trump beat I mean mercilessly beat 16 primary opponents I had very close associates on the Trump campaign very senior people to a person they did not like Paul Manafort and they found Rick gates for the short time he worked on the campaign with Manta fort well they found Rick Gates quote a disaster that's what they told me he was a disaster didn't know what he was doing and a president soon realized that well he was the candidate at that point and he fired them the will not touch president Trump in the least because these charges go back to 2006 in fact the last charge upon which they were indicted was in 2015 2015 a full year before Paul Manafort ever even got involved with the Trump campaign in other words this has nothing to do with the Trump campaign and nothing to do with Trump Russia Trump Russia collusion which is why Muller's investigation now needs to be shut down look these might be very serious financial crimes Paul Manafort might be guilty he might not be he's gonna have his day in court his lawyer the defense team will have a chance to present their case as will gates but that's not the issue here the issue is where Muller went now it is within the the authority of the special prosecutor special counsel who charge for any and all crimes that they might discover in the course of their investigation but this really wasn't within his scope this wasn't within Muller scope so now US taxpayers are footing the bill for a nine figure fishing expedition and that's problematic this is precisely why these kinds of crimes are precisely why we have a Department of Justice but these days we don't seem to we have an attorney general who is completely m.i.a we have a Deputy Attorney General and rod Rosenstein who's compromised he was lead prosecutor when the uranium one case was suppressed by the holder Department of Justice Eric Holder's Department of Justice for four years that is a very big problem we do not seem to have a functional Department of Justice and we cannot have these independent special prosecutors running around doing whatever they want to do it's a massive waste of taxpayer money but it's also a constitutional crisis robert muller virtually runs unchecked rot Rosenstein certainly isn't raining him in now look again if Paul Manafort did these things Paul Manafort should be prosecuted for these things and if he's found guilty served time in prison for doing these things if he's acquitted he should be left alone and allowed to live his life peacefully but again that's not the issue at hand the issue at hand is we now have a shadow Department of Justice what's even more problematic is these charges go back to 2006 the bulk of them between 2008 and 2015 when Barack Obama was president and it begs some very serious questions if all of this was so egregious and so of hurt why didn't Barack Obama Barack Obama's Department of Justice look into Paul Manafort why didn't James Comey or robert Muller's FBI look in a Paul Manafort back then it can't be because they didn't know this was going on that can't be what man affort was a public guy he operated in Washington DC circles the rumors were out there it begs a different kind of question though Paul Manafort was only with the Trump campaign for a few months however he worked with the Podesta's a Podesta group Tony Podesta John Podesta's brothers lobbying firm for years he was an associate of the Podesta group the years but could it be that Obama's FBI Obama's Department of Justice under Holder and Lynch and the FBI under Muller and Comey didn't look into manna for it because they didn't want it to wind up where it would have inevitably wound up on the doorstep of the Podesta's the Podesta's Democratic Party benefactors the Podesta's like this with the Clintons that's a question that needs to be asked and a question that needs to be looked at and it's another question that solidifies one thing robert muller has far too many conflicts of interest to remain special counsel we don't need a special counsel we have a Department of Justice and look I'm sick of hearing that calls from Muller to resign or be fired because of his conflicts of interest or bias or partisan they're not when Fitzgerald was when when patrick geryl was appointed special counsel and he was looking into who leaked the name of Valerie Plame during during george w bush's administration no one on the right asked Fitzgerald to resign because of conflicts of interest because he had none I think the chart was heavy-handed I think he went on a witch-hunt and persecuted people but I never thought he should resign for conflicts of interest because there were none to be found Muller's are glaringly obvious now what would give the president political cover perfect political cover this the next series of indictments include the Podesta so if they do if they include those darlings of the Democratic Party the Podesta's it would be the perfect time for the President of the United States and Jeff Sessions to shut the investigation down and let the Department of Justice take over and if Jeff Sessions won't do it president Trump needs to find an attorney general that will if you like this content as much as I love bringing it to you and I want to bring a tea every day please subscribe to our premium service at
