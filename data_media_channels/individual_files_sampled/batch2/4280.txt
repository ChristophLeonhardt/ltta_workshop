it isn't that time of year kids heading back to school but classrooms could still could now come equipped with something you might not expect according to a New York Times report education secretary Betsy DeVos is considering allowing states to use federal funding to buy guns for schoolteachers a school safety bill Congress passed in March allocated fifty million dollars a year to local school districts but the bill explicitly prohibited federal funds for firearms the Education Department is instead looking to use a program in the federal education law called the student support and academic enrichment grants which says nothing about prohibiting gun purchases leaving it to the discretion of DeVoss to approve any plans for firearms and firearms training let's bring in Ben White once again Noel Mick for Barbara Bianchi so I know Noel you've supported an NRA plan called the school shield program and you think they should pay for this that program obviously it's is it right to be using federal funds for this well you know I think that it would be better if the NRA would you know I think they'd make a lot of people happy maybe make a lot of people more sympathetic to what the NRA really does and what they stand for if they would implement that safety shield program again to where you know they would let's just say they put a security guard or they would do something like that you have to defend yourself from these school shootings look you know I gun control not gun control whether you're for it or against it you've got to do something because they are unarmed that they are using desk and safe rooms as their only alternative to protect from a crazy they're not the only alternative Ben I mean to you have a gun or there's no other way to protect yourself no of course there are other alternatives to trying to keep guns out of the hands of crazy people who come in and shoot up shoot up schools so but I think when it comes to Betsy DeVos and this program Congress has been pretty clear in its intent that it doesn't want federal funds used to arm teachers in this specific program that language isn't there but in this program the money is supposed to be spent on school enrichment programs for kids programs to improve education it's not supposed to be spent to put ak-47s in the hands of teachers teachers don't want them Homeland Security take this over why is this the Department of Education why does Betsy DeVos have the burden of having to do gun control I mean why didn't Homeland Security well it's not control that's not it's not but but Robert I know that you think teachers should be armed under certain circumstances and you have some background on this you were chief law enforcement officer for 44 police agencies where you set policies for officers and schools for people who are against this for teachers and I've heard a lot of them I've covered far too many of these school shootings who want to spend their time their talent their energy on teaching children what do you think I've listened to all the arguments I get it there's no perfect solution here but the bottom line is our kids are soft targets these schools cannot be properly secured I've gone out and literally evaluated them and more and more this happens you have a perimeter around these kids there has to be something done to interdict it's like the bank robbery scenario why do they rob banks because they know there's no guns and they know there's not gonna be any violence and they can get in and they can get out I'm sorry to say with the proper protocols most of the law enforcement officers I tell you have to put a long place that there's no liability for the teacher because I can tell you and you know this most law enforcement officers on the job never discharge a firearm so as a teacher as a teacher and you've got a classroom of 20 or 30 or 40 kids and you have to get it right really well the training has to be done exactly as it would be for the Lord for operated the trained owner it makes you train that's the point that has to be properly trained on a regular basis exactly as the cops do about use of force oh I'm not saying that it's a great thing to do but we can't allow our kids to be subjected to be shotting up like this and you know what we have to do is walk push meet people Chris we got to come to the scene with body bags because we have no opportunity at that time to do anything because we're not proactive I'm sorry to say it's just hard to believe we get to the point in this country where the alternative is to put the guns in the hands of teachers who have no idea how to use them who don't want to use them I have kids in schools I do not want my teachers having guns in their drawers I will I will when they have a security guard who has can observing since we've done all that we've done all the targets are now in this country right now is the questions in the Hangout telling you about unions do it for a living it is impossible to secure the schools so that there can't be ingress here period and the story and I'm not saying I like it but it needs to be done I'm gonna make one more point that you can take for what it's worth according to the National Center for Education Statistics the average teacher out of their own pocket and they're not getting rich being teacher spends four hundred and seventy nine dollars to help kids get school supplies so we're talking about not taking money to make sure that a kid has a pencil or a notebook or AB that's why another department needs to fund it
