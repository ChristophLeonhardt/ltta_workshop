me now in the studio is the former head of the Red Cross in Yemen the mission there Alexandra faith welcome back to RT International good to see you three strikes on civilians in three days these are supposed to be targeted strikes in your experience of having been in the country just how much risk are civilians in right now this many years into that conflict well let me start by saying that of course the pictures you have just shown horrific and been really moved by them in the two years that I have been in Yemen I have seen unfortunately quite a few others cases such like this one and when when you have a military operation on the scale which are taking place now in Yemen these things unfortunately happen and it is about most importance of course to document these cases and to bring the observations to the parties which is responsible for them so this is what we have been doing and consistently collecting information whenever there is a violation right or potential violation document the case and you have mentioned that there would be an investigation if we can feed into that investigation that is something that we do so I have no doubt that my colleagues now are following the case I'm not in Yemen anymore after two years that I spent over there and probably documenting the case or collecting information for for submission of reports that will hopefully help for the future bring more and care and in the way operations are conducted we have been doing this for about two years I was there and we are still doing it yeah that it felt like an almost impossible task though you wrote almost a year ago quite passionately about your experience in tyese the difficulty of getting into certain places just what kind of uphill struggle is there for aid workers once they get together well you know unfortunately we had a tragedy three days ago where one of the staff of the Yemen delegation was was killed in ties and and today I cannot help but think about him his family and and wife and this you know X is a stark reminder that working in Yemen remains tremely difficult we do it and extremely difficult circumstances in the case of ties there are extremely tense hard fighting taking place and doing this work documenting the cases is something that takes at all and sometimes takes a toll on the lives of our colleagues and in terms of getting that assistance in dealing with famine dealing with diseases like cholera and when there are efforts like the Saudi blockade of the port how much more difficult does it make getting that much-needed aid into those millions of people as you correctly point out there it's wider than a famine and there is a problem with a structural collapse of the system in Yemen you have problems of water you have problems of Sanitation we in the in the International Red Cross we try to fix those problems otherwise that would maybe not be any running water and so on anymore so there is no doubt that what is coming into the country at the moment is not enough and more should be done humanitarian aid is to some rural objects and allowed in but the problem is that more is needed to ensure a decent level of life for the population otherwise the country goes downhill so this is quite quite clearly something one of the message that I have been passing I've been going around many capitals today I'm in Moscow I was in other capitals before to pass that message that more should be done to ensure that there is enough essential goods for the civilian population today in sana and elsewhere and do you feel you're getting hurt by these capitals for a long time for a long time Yemen used to be not under the spotlight and at least I feel now that the Yemen conflict is getting the attention it deserves one year ago the secretion of united nation rang the alarm bell about the famine as I told you we believe this is wider than a famine is actually a structural collapse of essential goods and services so there is there is more awareness I think this can be said and when it comes to phrases like the the United Nations calling it the worst humanitarian crisis in modern history now there's people who sit around at the UN all those nations it's easy to condemn in words it's different when it comes to action are you getting the humanitarian aid coming in and is it just that it's being stopped from getting in or do you desperately need much much more more is needed I think this is quite clear it's not getting in enough for a combined combination of reasons its we shouldn't stop at simplistic sort of analysis it's it's there for a combination of reasons including the fact that you know shipping companies think twice as well about selling things because it can they and they can have some risk about it but yes the call I make today to you and to you or to your viewers that's today in Yemen you have a very serious crisis there is a food crisis there is also a crisis that has led to 1 million suspected cumulated cases of cholera last year in in a matter of six months it went like bushfire in 22 years in the ICRC I had never seen something like that so quite clearly yes you have a situation which is extremely worrying at the some of the reasons given for civilians being caught up in the air strikes and yes occasionally in war civilian casualties are unavoidable one of the reasons given is that they're being used as human shields from the people that you've spoken to in Yemen do you get the impression that people there are being exploited this is not something that I can see on my own observations on my own experience having said that it is important to remind all the parties to the conflict of their obligations under international humanitarian law one is to take precautions in the way they carry the attacks because they use vastly destruct forces this is on the attacking side and I would say now it's also crucially important that all those who are on the other side do not sort of place their military assets near you know villages and towns and so on and we have quite often I have to say intervened to make sure that one particular you know post is not located anymore any longer near a hospital near school or something like that and I have to say that on those occasions where we intervene we were heard and the party did move there a military asset who else is pressure do you need to try and help here because of the phenomenal efforts that organizations like the Red Cross go to in order to try and protect save look after civilians in a place like Yemen which which just seems bleak no matter which way you've read it who else are you appealing to to try and put pressure to bring this long running conflict to an end well I'm just I'm as I said I'm in Moscow today as a part of a world tour that I did after the end of my mission to raise awareness on the catastrophic situation that the country is going through at the moment from a humanitarian standpoint I've spoken of the cholera but I could I could also speak of a number of drugs which are missing which and we are we are giving some some of them which I have never done in my entire icse career like giving insulin and - because it's not sufficient what is there like you're supplying dialysis center these are things if you don't get your insulin injection or your dialysis session next week you're not around so you have the direct effect of the hostilities of the of the military operation that you spoke about at the beginning but you also have the indirect effect which are becoming increasingly important in Greece increasingly worrying and this is this has been my narrative in all the capitals of that I visited in the past or three weeks and it seems of national or public awareness why do you think it's fallen so far down the list for people I'm I followed dozens of news feeds on on Twitter and what have you and it's full of all sorts of nonsense of what's going on around the world that you would really consider important and yet when you see anything about Yemen they're talking biblical numbers about things that shouldn't be happening in a country in 2018 yes this has been also subject of an interrogation for me because I was there and I would have learned the world to be much more aware I suppose that other crises have brought more f-code more attention of the international public in media this is probably one of the reasons but now I'm you know I do think that there is more awareness when I started my mission in 2016 it was hardly any anyone who really spoke about here man and now and maybe you know my presence today in your studio is a shows that there is more awareness and I'm quite happy with this it's not where it should be probably but it's more than it used to be in terms of wishful thinking though even if it all ended tomorrow there's still a mountain of work to have to do there to bring Yemen even remotely back from the brink yes and I think you are perfectly right and and this is why I'm worried because one the secretary the Secretary General spoke about of a famine you know of a famine if you if you bring food it's okay well you have to deal with malnutrition for a few months and so on but here the problem is wider the problem is is one of a structural decay Yemen is not a country like you can find another condom you know elsewhere with a little literally infrastructure in Yemen you have a lot of infrastructure and this particular infrastructure is falling to pieces and the we at International Organization including the ICRC we we try to do what we can to support these structures but of course we can only do so much so I do agree with you that's bringing back the country on the on back on its feet will be a long a long lasting cause because that sounds like it's a technical problem that needs dealing with that aid is somehow just a front line is to do with water of food but it's not is it there are few doctors the ones over there I'm being paid the very structures of what the country needs in order to keep rolling and keep facilitating to start there at the moment it's not only one of the most serious crises that I have seen it's also as you point out one of the most complicated I have seen and I am afraid that this is becoming a feature of some of the conflicts you know some of the conflict where I work at the beginning of my career were very poor country you know they were poor before the walk ordering new one unfortunately poor after the war very little infrastructure so in a way very little to to reconstruct and the problem was relatively should I say simple to deal with here you have something which is extremely complex you have infrastructures which are falling to pieces up to the point on the health system we have commissioned a study from a well-known British School that's going to carry out a full study of the health system in Yemen to know where we are one day maybe we'll be talking here again about the rebuilding of Yemen in better circumstances a fear it might be a long way off but thanks very much for sharing your experiences over the past couple of years of running the Red Cross in Yemen really appreciate time thank you thank you for having me
