THE PRESIDENT'S NOMINEES.

20
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:56,998
WE HAD TO FILE CLOSURE TO SPEED

25
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:12,480
THAT HAPPENED ONLY 24 TIMES OVER

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,082
THE LAST 6 PRESIDENTS.

27
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:17,686
THEY MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO

28

CONFIRM JUDGES AS WELL.

29
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:20,088
EVEN THOUGH WE WIN THEM ALL,

YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

36
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,269
>> WELL, I THINK IT WILL BE

37
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:36,705
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

38
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:40,208
OFF YEAR ELECTIONS 2 YEARS INTO

39
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,009
ANY PRESIDENT.

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:43,245
BILL CLINTON LOST THE HOUSE AND

41
00:01:43,245 --> 00:01:43,578
SENATE.

42
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:44,846
OBAMA LOST THE HOUSE AND ALMOST

43
00:01:44,846 --> 00:01:46,681
LOST THE SENATE.

44
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:48,216
IT WILL BE A KNOCK DOWN, DRAG

00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,584
OUT FIGHT.

46
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:51,786
WE ARE OPTIMISTIC WE WILL STILL

48

APPOINTMENTS TO THE CABINET AND

51
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:09,037
ALL OF THAT, I THINK THE

52
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:09,971
AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO

53
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:11,906
UNDERSTAND THE CONQUENCES FOR

54
00:02:11,906 --> 00:02:15,076
THIS ADMINISTRATION IF WE LOSE

55
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:15,477

56
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,779
>> Laura: OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE

57
00:02:17,779 --> 00:02:19,347
ECONOMY IN THE FUTURE?

58
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,083
>> YES, THE ECONOMY IS ROARING.

59
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,119
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN DECADES.

60
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:25,654
JOBS ARE CREATED.

61
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:29,524
MUCH ATTRIBUTEED TO THE TAX CUTS

62
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,859
BILL PASS THE LAST DECEMBER.

63
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,328
IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE AN

64
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:35,430
AMERICAN LOOKING FOR WORK.

65
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,166
>> Laura: WHY WOULD PEOPLE VOTE

66
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,702
AGAINST THEIR OWN POCKETBOOKS?

67
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,371
>> THAT'S OUR ARGUMENT AND THEY

68
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,374
HOPE THEY SHARE OUR VIEW.

69
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,243
THIS IS NOT AN ENVIRONMENT

70
00:02:48,243 --> 00:02:49,444
CRYING OUT FOR CHANGE.

71
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:51,813
>> Laura: REPUBLICAN DONORS SAID

72
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:59,054
UNLESS CONGRESS PASSES THE DACA

73
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,156
AMNESTY, THEY WON'T GIVE A

74
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:01,589
PENNY.

75
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:03,391
ANY POSSIBILITY OF IMMIGRATION

76
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,526
REFORM GETTING PASSED IN THE

77
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:05,694
HOUSE AND THEN THE SENATE?

78
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:08,129
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IN THE

79
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:08,563
HOUSE.

80
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,665
I WENT TO IMMIGRATION EARLY THIS

81
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:10,965
YEAR.

82
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,667
WIDE OPEN FOR AMENDMENTS.

83
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:15,170
THE SENATE DIDN'T WANT TO PASS

84
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,972
ANY PARTICULAR VERSION OF IT.

85
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:20,241
I CAN'T SEE US GOING BACK TO

86
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,011
IMMIGRATION THIS YEAR UNLESS

87
00:03:23,011 --> 00:03:26,348
THERE WAS SOME PROPOSAL THE

88
00:03:26,348 --> 00:03:28,183
PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO SIGN.

89
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:28,983
I DON'T THINK HE IS ANYTHING

90
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:31,720
WITH ANYTHING I AM SEEING.

91
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,389
SHORT ANSWER NOT ON THE AGENDA

92
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,123
IN THE SENATE.

93
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:39,160
>> Laura: BOB CORKER AND OTHERS

94
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,664
EXPRESSED THEIR DISMAY OVER THE

95
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:45,266
PRESIDENT'S TARIFFS.

96
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:53,541
THE PRESIDENT WON ON THIS ROBUST

97
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,476
ECONOMIC NATIONAL PLATFORM.

98
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:58,113
GOOD FOR THE SENATE TO TAKE ON

99
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,514
THE PRESIDENT ON THE ISSUE OF

100
00:03:59,514 --> 00:03:59,848
TARIFFS?

101
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:00,882
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

102
00:04:00,882 --> 00:04:10,725
I AM NOT THRILLED ABOUT THE

103
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:15,563
TARIFFS, BUT WE WON'T BE PASSING

104
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:18,099
SOMETHING THAT THE PRESIDENT CAN

105
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:18,600
LEGALLY DO.

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,069
>> Laura: THE IG REPORT THAT WAS

107
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,972
DELAYED AND IS COMING OUT HAS

108
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,008
LEAKED PARTS OF IT SAYING THAT

109
00:04:27,008 --> 00:04:29,110
JIM COMEY THE FORMER FBI

110
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,914
DIRECTOR WAS INSUBORDINATE AND

111
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:36,818
DEFIED AUTHORITY IN THE WAY HE

112
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,655
HANDLED HIS JOB.

113
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:45,126
AT THE END HE NOTIFIED CONGRESS

114
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:47,862
AND CITED LORETTA LYNCH.

115
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,731
ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT GIVEN --

116
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:51,666
>> WE ARE ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT

117
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,934
HIS RECOMMENDATION WILL BE.

118
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:55,503
WE HEARD HE IS A STRAIGHT

119
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:55,837
SHOOTER.

120
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,505
WE KNOW HE IS CONDUCTING THIS

121
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:57,939
INVESTIGATION.

122
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,773
I HAVE NOT HEARD ABOUT THE

123
00:04:58,773 --> 00:04:59,073
LEAKS.

124
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:01,910
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIS REPORT.

125
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,712
I HOPE IT COMES OUT SOON.

126
00:05:04,712 --> 00:05:07,215
>> Laura: THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF

127
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,250
THE FBI ANDREW McCABE'S LAWYERS

128
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,319
IS ASKING FOR IMMUNITY BEFORE HE

00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,555
TESTIFIES BEFORE THE SENATE

130
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:15,023
COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHUCK

131
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,523
GRASSLEY.

132
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,192
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?

133
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,562
>> THAT'S CERTAINLY INTERESTING.

134
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:22,864
YOU COULD IMPLY WHAT YOU CHOOSE

135
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,933
TO IMPLAY FROM THAT SORT OF

136
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,734
THING.

137
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,369
YOU ARE A LAWYER.

138
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,473
I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING

139
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:31,806
REQUEST.

140
00:05:31,806 --> 00:05:33,441
>> Laura: A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID

141
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:34,809
DONALD TRUMP IS CALLING THE FBI

142
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,177
INTO QUESTION.

143
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:38,880
HOW DARE HE QUESTION THE FBI.

144
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,015
WE LOVE THE FBI BUT THIS IS THE

145
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,350
DIRECTOR OF THE FBI AND THE

146
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,151
DEPUTY DIRECTOR.

147
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:44,986
>> I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS

148
00:05:44,986 --> 00:05:46,788
WILL COME OUT SOONER OR LATER.

149
00:05:46,788 --> 00:05:50,291
THE IG REPORT IS SOMETHING THAT

150
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,125
WILL BE INTERESTING.

151
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,428
>> Laura: THE BIG QUESTION FOR

152
00:05:53,428 --> 00:05:56,931
ALL OF US COURT WATCHERS IS THE

153
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:58,500
SUPREME COURT.

154
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,101
THE DECISION COMING OUT KENNEDY

155
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:01,069
AND THE MAJORITY.

156
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,940
THE BAKERY CASE THIS WEEK.

157
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,512
IF KENNEDY STEPS DOWN AND

158
00:06:10,512 --> 00:06:12,046
RETIRES, WHEN WILL THE SUPREME

159
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:14,716
COURT HEARINGS BE HELD GIVEN THE

160
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,784
TIGHT SCHEDULE WE ALREADY HAVE?

161
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:18,152
>> THE CONGRESS MEETS UNTIL

162
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:19,988
DECEMBER 31st THIS YEAR.

163
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:22,557
IF WE GET A VACANCY IN THE NEXT

164
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,959
MONTH OR TWO WE WILL DEAL WITH

165
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,227
IT THIS YEAR.

166
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,428
>> Laura: BEFORE THE NEW COURT

167
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,196
TERM BEGINS?

168
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:30,965
>> IT WILL BE HELD THIS YEAR.

169
00:06:30,965 --> 00:06:33,835
IF THERE IS A VACANCY IN THE

170
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,136
NEXT MONTH OR TWO, WE HAVE

171
00:06:35,136 --> 00:06:39,474
PLENTY OF TIME TO DO THE

172
00:06:39,474 --> 00:06:39,908
CONFIRMATION.

173
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:41,209
>> Laura: ANY SENSE THAT THE

174
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:44,812
PRESIDENT HAS NARROWED DOWN THE

175
00:06:44,812 --> 00:06:47,115
CANDIDATES TO 1 OR 2 PEOPLE?

176
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,616
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY ARE NOT

177
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,517
BEING ABOUT THIS.

178
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:52,220
I BELIEVE THEY ARE.

179
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:55,557
IF A VACANCY OCCURS WE GET A

180
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:59,260
NOMINATION QUICKLY AND DEAL

181
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,428
WITH.

182
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:02,096
IT'S NOT JUST THE SUPREME COURT.

183
00:07:02,096 --> 00:07:04,699
WE HAVE CONFIRMED 21 CIRCUIT

184
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:09,203
COURT JUDGES IN THE FIRST YEAR

185
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,004
AND A HALF OF THE TRUMP

186
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:11,172
ADMINISTRATION.

187
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:13,474
BREAKING ALL RECORDS.

188
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,444
ONE 8th OF THE CIRCUIT JUDGES

189
00:07:16,444 --> 00:07:18,780
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED IN A YEAR

190
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,180
