of instability to other regions and countries and this is a challenge to international peace and security the civilization dialogue and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction genuine long-term solutions require a comprehensive approach on the basis of international law without double standards and based on the UN Charter the situation in the border of Israel and the Gaza sector

efforts to maintain maximally efficient work of the UN Security Council based on the constructive cooperation of all its members I would like to say several words on the statements of the representatives of the US State Department on the role of Russia in the Korean settlement we have taken note the information published by the media stating that representatives of the US State Department called Russia to cooperation with Washington and the Korean issue instead of I quote working against us on this track if such remarks actually reflect the position of the foreign policy this is a reason for concern during the visit of the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov North Korea on the 31st of May and his meeting with the president of the North Korean State Council Kim jong-un and the North Korean Foreign Minister Leon Russia has publicly expressed its support for the efforts of Pyongyang and Washington to normalize the bilateral relations and expressed his hope for a successful summit between North Korea and yes moreover the roadmap of the Korean settlement which was formulated by Russia and China stayed a necessity to establish direct dialogue between the u.s. and North Korea it is clear that the process of improvement of relations between the u.s. and North Korea and the refusal of hostility and lack of trust which are necessary to reach any sustainable agreements will take a long period of time and will require careful steps towards each other that is why we called not to express too high hopes and not to put forward requirements we would like to hope that position of common sense and find ways to find new solutions aimed at the establishment of solid peace in Northeast Asia instead of fighting the black cat where there is none now moving on to the development of the situation in Syria in the past week the situation on Syria has been as follows terrorist presence and the capital region has been eliminated the Syrian authorities have assumed control of the south and areas of Damascus in hogr that's what the dominant as well as the Palestinian refugee camp er remaining terrorists of ISIL from 800 to 1500 people have been evacuated to the desert areas located on the border of the Homs and Dara's or provinces their families who were taken to the eaglet province the national flags of Syria were raised in the liberated areas mine clearance has begun as well as works of the local services and law enforcement agencies repair groups are removing the debris from the streets thousands of refugees eager to come back to their homes before the clean-up operations have been finished at the same time the security situation in the north and northwest of Syria degraded following terrorist attacks committed that the headquarters of the al-nusra front over 50 civilians held what killed her wounded flashes all different illegal armed troops more than 20 terrorists were killed jihad is acting in the desolation zone it conducted provocative shellings of the Syrian control territories in the first three days of this week they have fired 105 mines and rockets against the local neighborhoods of left around the chance of Luca Malin Maidan in the east of the the resort province the Isis fighters have committed a number of new attacks against the strongholds of the government forces at the same time four groups were intercepted trying to come to the southwest of the Deir Ezzor province from the east of the country I shall also mentions the humanitarian situation in Syria the general background of the session of the security again Security Council that was held on the 29th of may in New York was the fact that as a result of the Syrian army the majority of the territory of the country controlled by terrorists and extremists of the neighborhoods Damascus is that the conditions created for the normalization of how the situation and about 200 needing assistance of the among the mountains thousand people displaced persons returned allocated 16 million dollars for the humanitarian assistance Western dollar donors who are caring for this opposition neighborhoods like at command losing the interest for these process and there is a cynical stance so that only after a political transition deserving trust their cue material citizens can surrender and they mean by this the change in the power the discussion has shown that the humanitarian crisis has been exploited by the affirmative opponents of the legitimate Syrian government in order to exert influence and Damascus and the ignoring of the catastrophic consequences of unilateral economic sanctions imposed by the West serious humanitarian problems created by the actions of Washington large coalition are being silenced staffed staffed with mines and the unexploded munitions there are minimum conditions created for the return about the victims and for the work of communitarian of organizations although the number of people returning is increasing and it is about 135,000 people now and in three days months we cannot resolve the situation assistance to the claims including case of family to decay Syrian authorities concerns of the property rights of its citizens the critics are very has every buyer stance because of the Donata wanted to maintain a direct dialogue with the governmental forces that would help but resolve all the misunderstandings and contradictions as for the situation in we positively assess launching the nationwide dialogue on the 16 so far me that will help existent problems in a Nicaragua that will exclude the foreign influence situation and it was the progressive development of the country government to resolve the situation and we talk about that all this which are progressively try to develop this process at the negotiation table the answer to confrontation and to the stand of unacceptable and I can only lead to the loss of lives of innocent people and to this collation of tensions russia has advocated and still advocates the reason some discrepancies in a peaceful way they see no no they to these Central American country has in defending its sovereignty and the democratic values power base we are still close attention during situation in the secure vault and last week there was a video featuring us cripple and it gives us hope and we are glad that she is in good conditions in good health and as for her return to the country we are willing to render her any assistance but are these video raises many questions as for whether our citizens is free in statements we do not know all the conditions and conditions whether she is able to contact the outside world we not do not know if your decisions and Tate meant are self-sufficient and independent and at the same time we would like the UK to comply with its obligations and to render us access to all our citizens would like also to know notice that the state of us care Paul in the video and reserved I mean testifying to the lack of psychological and other assistance from her relatives and family and under protects falsified protects the UK authorities denied access to natural sister who tried to come to the country this sincere and desire was prevented from being realized by London and London doesn't care about the feelings the family will not accept a such a neglect for human rights and ignoring aniline able rights and freedoms of our persons as for the unimpeded movement and also include the family and the relative statements by the doctor's emblem Salisbury heart from the Salisbury Hospital do not clear this make the situation more clear but at the same time they do not coincide with the data are voiced regarding this topic this only proves our position regarding the targeted and misleading information spread by the UK and such so-called facts have been spread by the UK and still it doesn't want to contact and to maintain direct dialogue with Russia creating the atmosphere of secrecy around the investigation and controlling of the flow of information in the media before still demand at London present all the answers to our questions regarding the propagation in Salisbury according that the British authorities should clarify whether the samples of inner virgins no chalk type have been developed or not on what signs on what grounds they assume that it was produced in Russia do they have control samples over the address that they call normal job since of answers to these questions only proves the decent and shameful role of London in these provocation that caused damage to our citizens dwelling on this topic I like also to say on the anti-russian report of the UK government disseminated by House of Commons about the British Parliament called titled was called 'russian corruption in the UK which has enunciated positions against Russia it raises a great deal of questions this is another element Russian convenient British authorities and it coincides with the consideration of are they dropped war in the parliament which is aimed at establishing a legal framework for a new national sanctions policy the adoption of this dropped can complicate the multilateral interaction within the international mechanisms as it is known has been in monitoring and their financial intelligence unit are the key information change on the table rostering maintain working contacts with the British delegations with the fault financial action task force such totalized information and endanger the work of the international organizations the double standards of these such policy of London is evident London has given our refuges too many refuge to many Russian citizens blamed for substantial crimes many of them present themselves as political refugees about the actually are charged with fraud a large-scale food with assassinations with extremists and other serious crimes general user sat on top of the British parliamentarians to accompany the second being with anti-russian the slogans as a testimony testimony that they have shaped policy with all the negative consequences for our bilateral ties according to the information coming from Prague including from the Czech media authorities still on the monument of the clarification with some true facts that will add to case biography this text is far from the historic truth presented has taken part in the intelligence training for the troop so far they were also treaty when they entered Czechoslovakia in 1968 didn't have any anything to do with that because he retired from from the Army in the 1963 and died in 1973 given many assessments during our briefings regarding the situation of whether monument or never checked out though the fact that these initiatives are not prevented and do not get an adequate or moral and legal assessment from the alleges from the executive power of their Republic is very disconcerting and the placement of any additional information on the moment is absurd and their clarification that do not correspond to the initial idea of the monument as a just pure rhetoric and the distortion effects in order to influence the thoughts of the people and their mentor to ignore into the tensions truth and the gratitude to a man whose role in the fight against passions and immigration in Europe cannot be overestimated a solemn ceremony the participation of the governor that would be a ceremony of transferring the church Catholic Church to religious community of us and Clement that would comment in Sebastopol this would coincide without the 135th anniversary of founding of the city and also laying the groundwork for the main base the church was built in 1908 they see no no their voluntary donations including from the address family then it was destroyed by the fascist during the Great Patriotic War then it was restored interior used as cinema for the children a question was also raised according to the agreements to Russia the secretary of state of Vatican Cardinal parolin pooting adjusted who became possible and this is a testimony of a constructive development of relations between the Russian and Vatican and the most important element of which is the restoring of confidence between the Russian earth autotags and the Roman Catholic churches a question coming from the polish media regarding the refusal of aintry niala foundry to mr.
