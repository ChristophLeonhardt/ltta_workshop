>> WHAT ABOUT THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS?
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS COME
MIDTERMS --
>> BUT EVERYBODY THINKS --
>> I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT HE
RECUSED HIMSELF, AND MANY PEOPLE
THINK I WAS RIGHT ON THAT.
>> Martha: NEWS TONIGHT, IS
ATTORNEY GENERAL JEFF SESSIONS
NOW RESPONDING TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S LATEST DIG ON HIM?
AND RESPONDING TO THE LATEST
ROUND OF CRITICISM AT A DOJ NEWS
CONFERENCE.
>> HE'S BEEN FRUSTRATED BY MY
RECRUITERS
RECUSAL, BUT WE HAVE BEEN SO
PLEASED AND HONORED TO BE GIVEN
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO USE HIS
AGENDA AT THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE.
I AM PLEASED AND HONORED TO HAVE
THAT RESPONSIBILITY, AND I WILL
DO SO AS LONG AS IT'S
APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO DO SO.
>> Martha: JIM JORDAN OF OHIO,
A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO
SEE YOU TONIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.
IF YOUR REACTION.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY CRITICAL OF THE
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
I THINK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
DOESN'T THINK PEOPLE FOCUS
ENOUGH ON THE WORK THEY ARE
DOING.
>> ROD ROSENSTEIN IS IN CHARGE
OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, NOT
JEFF SESSIONS, AND IS ALSO
OBVIOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR A NEW
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.
MY GUESS THAT WILL HAPPEN
SOMETIME IN THE NOT-SO-DISTANT
FUTURE.
JEFF SESSIONS IS A GOOD MAN, A
GOOD SENATOR, BUT I THINK IT'S
THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES WANTS AN
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WILL
CONDUCT MATTERS DIFFERENTLY, AND
I THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE
NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE.
>> Martha: VERY CRITICAL OF
ROD ROSENSTEIN, AS WELL.
HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET THE DOJ
TO TURN OVER A LOT OF DOCUMENTS.
THE PRESIDENT FEELS FOR NOW HE'S
OFF THE HOOK.
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?
>> NOW, I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT.
WE SUBPOENAED FOR THE MEMOS, WE
HAVEN'T RECEIVED THOSE.
WE ASKED FOR THE AUGUST 2ND MEMO
OF 2017 WHERE ROD ROSENSTEIN
ALTERED THE SCOPE OF SPECIAL
COUNSEL ROBERT MUELLER'S
INVESTIGATION.
HE WON'T LET US SEE THAT.
WE'VE ASKED FOR BRUCE OHR'S
THREE OH TWOS, AND HE WON'T LET
US SEE THOSE.
ON TOP OF ALL THAT, HE WAS A
NO-SHOW LAST WEEK WHEN HE WAS
ASKED TO COME IN AND GIVE US
ANSWERS UNDER OATH AND NOW
TODAY, A KEY PLAYER IN THIS
WHOLE AFFAIR TOOK THE FIFTH.
SO NO, I HAVE AS BIG A BEEF WITH
ROD ROSENSTEIN AS I DO WITH JEFF
SESSIONS BECAUSE ROD ROSENSTEIN
IS THE ONE MAKING IT DIFFICULT
TO DO OUR JOB AS A SEPARATE BUT
EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT.
>> Martha: 'S ROD ROSENSTEIN'S
ATTORNEY DISAGREES WITH YOU,
WHICH I'M SURE IT IS NOT A BIG
SURPRISE.
TALKING ABOUT YOU GUYS, WATCH.
>> THIS COMMITTEE HAS LARGELY
CONDUCTED ITS BUSINESS THROUGH
SECRET, CONFIDENTIAL INTERVIEWS,
BINDING WITNESSES AND THEIR
COUNSEL, TO SILENCE, WHILE THE
MEMBERS WALK OUTSIDE TO ALL OF
YOU, THE MEDIA, AND THE PUBLIC,
AND SELECTIVELY LEAK FROM THOSE
INTERVIEWS TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY
WANT YOU TO HEAR.
>> Martha: THUS GLENN
SIMPSON'S ATTORNEY VERSION OF
THIS.
>> GLENN SIMPSON TOOK THE FIFTH
TODAY.
YOU TAKE THE FIFTH IF YOU
BELIEVE YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF
CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON YOU TAKE
THE FIFTH.
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE DID THAT,
BECAUSE OF HE'S DOING IT JUST TO
OBSTRUCT A CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATION, THAT'S WRONG, IS
ALSO.
I THINK HE DID IT BECAUSE HE'S
CONCERNED ABOUT CRIMINAL
LIABILITY.
TO SAY THAT WE ARE THE PROBLEM?
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.
THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN HIRED GLENN
SIMPSON WHO THEN WENT OUT AND
HIRED A FOREIGNER AND THE WIFE
OF A TOP JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
OFFICIAL TO PRODUCE THE DOSSIER
THAT THEY THEN FUNNELED TO BRUCE
OHR WHO GAVE IT TO THE FBI, WHO
THEN WENT TO THE SECRET COURT SO
THEY COULD GET A WARRANT TO SPY
ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN.
AND THEY ARE ACCUSING US OF
WRONGDOING FOR TRYING TO GET
ANSWERS FOR HOW THAT ALL TOOK
PLACE CUSTOMERS THAT IS JUST
RIDICULOUS.
HE TOOK THE FIFTH BECAUSE HE'S
CONCERNED ABOUT CRIMINAL
LIABILITY AND I THINK JOHN SAID
THIS A COUPLE DAYS AGO AND SAID
IT WELL, ONE THING TO ONE
COMMITTEE, AND ANOTHER WITNESS
FOR OUR COMMITTEE, THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE, WHO SAID EXACTLY THE
OPPOSITE.
THAT'S WHAT HE MOST LIKELY TOOK
THE FIFTH TODAY.
>> Martha: THE WIFE OF BRUCE
