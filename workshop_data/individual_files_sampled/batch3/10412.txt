the US Embassy in Iraq has announced 150 million dollars is to be spent on rebuilding cities left devastated in the war on Islamic state but that's only a fraction of what the US has earmarked for its continued military operations there are teas Moorhead gas DF has more on the story what does this look like to you Mad Max Resident Evil no this is Mosul no rather what's left of it corta sea of thousands of airstrikes we filmed this a few weeks ago and nothing's really changed from when we were there last this is what the aftermath of a classic airstrike in Mosul look like neighborhoods that numbered in the thousands have been reduced to a handful the Iraqi army and the us-led coalition seemed to make sure to not leave a square metre and scorched forever talk of precision I haven't yet seen a single house and Mosul untouched by fighting the neighboring Street all but destroyed the street across rubble the street over there it's the same story wherever you look cities and towns that house millions are devastated husks even now in Mosul you never far from the stench of rotting bodies or unexploded bombs help reconstruction no one's seen any of that halli majority margin at the day an orgy of arsenal when in Masada - and what else is there to do in Mosul I mean that's if she ever thought how strange the US had pledged to help undo what its bombs did they were already helping fund reconstruction Iraq says it needs a hundred billion dollars to rebuild and the United States has doubled its pledge to one hundred and fifty million dollars there were about 0.1 percent of what Iraq needs and no one seems to have seen any of that Leticia her now it's been six months since the liberation but even if 60 months had passed nothing would happen because the rebuilding efforts are limited and small there is massive destruction here as if it was Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan there's rubble in the streets and we can smell the corpses of Islamic state quitters there's no electricity or water no NGO came to check on us you see the debris my children are in sixth fourth and third grade but they haven't opened any schools the numbers entirely different leagues but the United States spent on burning Isis out of Iraq and what the US has pledged to repair the damage it did are entirely in comparable numbers the average cost of a u.s. airstrike in Iraq at the beginning of the operation very roughly Counting fuel flight time cost of bombs maintenance and military pay was half a million dollars for one airstrike they carried out 14,000 airstrikes in Iraq alone and after helping turn Iraqis cities into this all they can pledges one hundred and fifty million dollars the equivalent of two mid-sized passenger jets that isn't going to change many lives in Iraq
