you just sort of peace that has been pinging around the internet like Samus Dada it's responding to president Trump's immigration remarks and he joins us tonight Andrew thanks a lot for coming on this is one of these pieces that probably one in three of our viewers got by text this weekend but I just want to read the first line which kind of crystallizes it nothing scandalizes a leftist like the truth that's your opening what does that mean well the left has been tremendously successful in making the statement of simple facts seem rude and evil and unkind so if you come forward and you say well men and women are different and have different desires and different career paths if you say that african-americans commit a disproportionate amount of violent crimes if you say that Muslims commit a disproportionate amount of terrorism suddenly they rear back and they start to call you a bigot they start to say you're racist or sexist or Islamophobic or whatever until the the statement of simple data things that are just factually true become unexpressable you're not allowed to say them and I don't think conservatives fully appreciate the the power of that kind of mental slavery conservatives are not very good with culture and we don't understand the way it wraps itself around your mind and keeps you from saying the things that you're thinking but shouldn't all American citizens regardless of political party or philosophy just by virtue of being American demand to live by the standard we always have live by which is truth as a defense you may not like it but if it's true I have the right to say it shouldn't we stand by that yes and usually you know it used to be that the First Amendment and the fact that Americans just tend to be kind of loudmouths and say what comes into their heads it used to protect us but the left has been exceptionally good at making sure I mean look we've learned just last week the Twitter's shadow back banning conservatives we've seen how Google fires a guy who states something that's politically incorrect we've seen Prager University videos banned on YouTube we know that there is this massive and when conservative speakers go to universities they are met by violent resistance even if they're very intelligent people like ben shapiro or charles murray they met with violent resistance the left is very intent on silencing right-wing opinion and it's very powerful I mean you look over what's happening in Europe where their immigration policy since the war have virtually destroyed their culture people who come out there and say well you know maybe Islam doesn't fit in England maybe it doesn't fit in some of the Scandinavian countries are destroyed there they were made into pariahs as a result we saw how in Rotherham in England at a conservative estimate 1,400 little girls were raped by Pakistani Muslims because the police themselves didn't want to come out and call them out and say they were afraid of being called racist so they allowed this atrocity to continue one of the things that I see when I look at Donald Trump I'm a very polite guy and I'm a guy who doesn't like to offend people just like most of us one of the things I see that actually works for Donald Trump is his rudeness and his boorishness actually have shattered this prison of political correctness that the left has managed to construct and I think that's the reason that every word that comes out of his mouth and every tweet that he sends out is such a scandal I mean if you turn on CNN over the weekend after his remarks about Haiti and African countries every one of their anchormen was crying you know their little trembling lips and the misty eyes because it was so intolerable that to them that Donald Trump was not restrained by their definition of what's cruel and their definition of what's impolite this is a network where Anderson Cooper called ordinary right-wing Americans he called them tea baggers and now when Hades insulted suddenly Anderson his lip is trembling and his eyes are all misty it's a form of bullying it's a it's simply a form of social bullying and I'm grateful for Donald Trump for shattering that even when he does it in ways that I find kind of appalled yeah I agree completely societies that hate themselves this much tend to collapse and so I'm glad you're fighting sure that tendency thank you Andrew thanks a lot that's really a great piece the pleasure
