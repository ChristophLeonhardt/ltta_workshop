00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
hello friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is past midnight so</font>

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,430
it's not really vlogmas day 17th but

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,690
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to call it that</font>

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway um I have been thinking a lot</font>

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:14,910
about resolutions today as I mostly come

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,500
up with ideas about what I want my

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,539
resolutions to be I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,910
elsewhere that I set kind of goals

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,670
throughout the year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not really</font>

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,189
necessarily my biggest goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> set in time</font>

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:27,840
but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're thinking</font>

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and part of that is because kind</font>

13
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">of connected to that video made about</font>

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,450
being an overachiever one of the things

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,160
that's nice about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new year is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,350
feel that gets sort of resetting the

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,570
clock and giving yourself another chance

18
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,280
at achieving dizzy weren't able to

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">achieve in the previous year on the</font>

20
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:45,059
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand it can feel like added</font>

21
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:46,649
pressure and it can also feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

22
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,360
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running against something</font>

23
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,489
especially if you kind of quantify that

24
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,850
in terms of like birthdays and you know

25
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,320
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these ambitions when I</font>

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,910
was little and didn't really understand

27
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,120
age in not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I necessary ghost and</font>

28
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,949
age now but you know I had all these

29
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,449
ambitions of like war i will yet book

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,369
published by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time in 14 and so on</font>

31
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:08,580
resolutions in their most positive

32
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,640
incarnation can be little reminders to

33
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,880
yourself about where your intentions and

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,650
values are and where your principles are

35
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,070
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also like the possibility of what</font>

36
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,960
you're doing it helps you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom out</font>

37
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,049
for a second and not necessarily just

38
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,060
take things day by day but zoom out even

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,640
further than that and see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,170
here is coming together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the bits</font>

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,750
and pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can achieve to get</font>

42
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself in a position you want to be</font>

43
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,280
your helper you want to help or just be

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,530
the kind of person that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

45
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,780
be can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful but it also can be a</font>

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,490
lot of pressure so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just balancing</font>

47
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,110
the two for me personally something that

48
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've been taking a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about for the new</font>

49
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,579
year is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cynical and being</font>

50
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,399
more generous with my attitude and

51
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,200
generous my attitude<font color="#CCCCCC"> towards people</font>

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,960
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in light of the</font>

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,189
political<font color="#CCCCCC"> climate and in light of</font>

54
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:01,770
everything else is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on there will</font>

55
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,590
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough cynicism everywhere and I</font>

56
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,470
mean you know not being critical not

57
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,910
being critical reader not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

58
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,190
critical thinker I just mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font>

59
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of cynicism that doesn't add in the</font>

60
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,680
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and doesn't help anyone I'm not</font>

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,300
painting with a broad brush here I

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,049
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> personally my cynicism</font>

63
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:25,090
doesn't help people my cynicism when it

64
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,319
comes out is kind of mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cruel in</font>

65
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,620
ways and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that is something</font>

66
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is definitely exacerbated by</font>

67
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,340
getting sucked in I getting reactive

68
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,079
rather than proactive and<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-to-date and</font>

69
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,819
I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things in a way</font>

70
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:49,230
that's helpful when i get reactive<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

71
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,959
become cynical and mean and sometimes

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,730
nasty so that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've been</font>

73
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,430
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about like choosing</font>

74
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,069
kindness and<font color="#E5E5E5"> generosity but also the</font>

75
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:01,720
proactive approach rather than the

76
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,370
reactive one I asked you guys tonight

77
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,379
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> dating resolutions because I've</font>

78
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">been thinking about just setting little</font>

79
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,970
fun things like note low pressure things

80
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">what fun things to do like going to</font>

81
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,959
dates a month or something and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

82
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:17,920
as an activity as a pastime but I've

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,090
been asking because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

84
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,040
interesting to see how people's

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,349
resolutions shift when they take someone

86
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:25,840
else into account and that and also how

87
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you frame that it was like always</font>

88
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:30,519
reading a bunch of BuzzFeed personality

89
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,950
test results for all of you in a way I

90
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,209
didn't feel like I could see into your

91
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:35,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">solo and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything about your anything</font>

92
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,870
it just it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a little indicator</font>

93
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,910
of something about you which was really

94
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,250
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me to see and saw where</font>

95
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run out in your lives and what</font>

96
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:45,639
you're struggling<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and what you're</font>

97
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,190
more confident about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

98
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,980
obviously just one aspect and it was

99
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,239
great to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear from asexual aromantic</font>

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,220
people about how that has affected their

101
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,079
lives and their goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the next year</font>

102
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,250
and so on I don't know why the

103
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,430
specificity itself came up but I just

104
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought was a fun fun prom take you to</font>

105
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,940
everyone also<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that invest on videos</font>

106
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,859
really excited to edit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and put that</font>

107
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,139
up sometime the next few days so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

108
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,549
wondering also whether may wish<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

109
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:14,590
one about resolutions where you will

110
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,370
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one resolution</font>

111
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:17,839
to let me know if you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

112
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,668
in comments I still like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to edit my</font>

113
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hamilton a race video so maybe I'll try</font>

114
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:24,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that this weekend who knows I'm</font>

115
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,780
sitting in front of a Christmas present

116
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,389
for people that I care a lot about and

117
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:32,270
but I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like watching it and hoping</font>

118
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn out the way I'd</font>

119
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,380
like it to turn out I think sometimes I

120
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,479
feel invasive when I ask people what

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,160
their resolutions are because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> such</font>

122
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,770
a personal question and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds a lot</font>

123
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,139
about about what you are not happy with

124
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,630
yourself about the idea of sitting on it

125
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,320
all for a moment and thinking and and

126
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,960
choosing what you need to prioritize it

127
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,610
all comes down to organization and

128
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,050
stretch it again you're looking back at

129
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,150
the places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you don't feel like you</font>

130
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,310
did enough before or like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past</font>

131
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,960
you don't feel like you incorporated

132
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,030
something into your life enough and then

133
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,500
it's looking forward in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense that</font>

134
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,380
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at what you like to be what</font>

135
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,970
you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to become so it's this kind</font>

136
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,289
of definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of who you've been and</font>

137
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:19,100
then this definition of who you want to

138
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,740
be or you consider yourself to be inside

139
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,110
and then haven't realized yet and that's

140
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's kind of exciting to me about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it I</font>

141
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,849
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> for London on Tuesday and I have</font>

142
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:31,820
to clean my flat tomorrow to get ready

143
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">and finish packing and wash my clothes</font>

145
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,599
many many other things but I definitely

146
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,700
had a bit of a self-care day and sat in

147
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">bed and read Harry Potter for a couple</font>

of hours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have her mask on right</font>

149
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,190

greasy I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I have</font>
