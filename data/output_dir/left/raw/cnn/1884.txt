00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,850
I want to bring it out CNN national
security analyst James clapper the

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,390
former Director of National Intelligence
mr. clapper thank you so much for

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:09,179
joining us what did you think of
tonight's performance by president

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,719
trauma well done it's hard to know where
to where to start just so objectionable

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:22,970
on so many levels you know I told in one
capacity or another for every president

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,349
since including John F Kennedy through
President Obama and I don't know when

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,670
I've listened and watched something like
this of a president that I found more

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:41,070
disturbing having some understanding of
the levers of power that are available

9
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:51,120
to a president if he chooses to exercise
them I found this downright scary and

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,760
disturbing
I think Bakari is right on the money

11
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:06,590
though that this is not a surprise it
interesting to contrast last night's

12
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:13,320
teleprompter Trump performance versus
tonight which is of course the real

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,580
Trump just as it was in that the unglued
impromptu press conference at Trump

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,920
Tower so I just find this extremely
disturbing are you questioning his

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:37,530
fitness yes I do i I really questioned
his ability to his fitness to be in this

16
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:45,479
office and I also beginning to wonder
about his motivation for it maybe maybe

17
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:54,420
he is looking for a way out I do wonder
as well about the people that attracted

18
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,320
to to this to the this rally as others
you know what are they thinking or why

19
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:08,459
am I so far out off base because I don't
understand the adulation and of course

20
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,640
that's why I think he
gravitated to having this rally is

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,829
ill-timed as it as it is
he should have quit wise ahead after

22
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:24,739
last night but again I think the the
real Trump came through and again as

23
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:29,870
bokhari said shouldn't be a big surprise
to anyone what should we do what should

24
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,769
we can do at this point you said your
questioning is fitness there are many

25
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,040
people who are saying it they won't say
it publicly they don't have the courage

26
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,150
that you do maybe after the speech they
will now it will become painfully

27
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:49,489
obvious - as it is to most Americans
what should we do well I think you know

28
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:56,419
the key thing here is where is he with
Republicans and I was quite struck by

29
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:06,290
Senator corkers remarks very thoughtful
and very very measured and I've I know

30
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:13,430
senator corker have dealt with him and
he is a very thoughtful senator and he

31
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:20,120
wouldn't say that lightly and and
without forethought and I'm hopeful that

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:28,430
other similarly thoughtful Republicans
will reach the point where enough is

33
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:35,599
enough enough is enough and what do you
what do you mean he playing for it

34
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:45,340
well that this behavior and this
divisiveness and the and the complete

35
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,859
intellectual moral and ethical void that
the president United States exhibits and

36
00:03:53,859 --> 00:04:00,169
how much longer does the country have to
to borrow a phrase and doer this

37
00:04:00,169 --> 00:04:07,849
nightmare the New York Times is
reporting tonight about the falling out

38
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:11,000
between the president and Mitch
McConnell over the investigations of

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,629
Russia's interference in the 2016
election there you see the headline up

40
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,500
on the screen the report says the
president was furious that McConnell

41
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,219
failed to protect him you call the
accusations of collusion between the

42
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:24,810
Trump campaign and Russia worse than
water

43
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,640
what do you think is going on with the
president why is this such a hot button

44
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:37,590
for him well first to be clear done I
when I left certainly on the 22 January

45
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:45,120
I I had not seen any evidence of direct
collusion between the Trump campaign the

46
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,520
Trump camp and the Russians there may
have been collusion but I didn't have

47
00:04:50,520 --> 00:05:01,940
any evidence of it so I don't understand
frankly the president's fascination and

48
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,790
solicitation of solicitousness of Russia
and Putin particularly unless he feels

49
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:17,310
he's a kindred soul perhaps so it is it
is very strange to me and I don't have

50
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,420
an explanation for it I don't know if
it's collusion or something else you

51
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:25,710
have you said you questioned his his
fitness is he a threat to national

52
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,040
security the president well he certainly
could be again having some understanding

53
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:41,850
of the the levers that a president can
exercise I worry about frankly you know

54
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:50,100
the access to nuclear codes the in a fit
of pique he decides to do something

55
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:58,770
about Kim Jungman there's actually very
little to to stop them the sister hole

56
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:05,400
systems built to ensure a rapid response
if if necessary so they're very little

57
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,110
in the way of controls over you know
exercising a nuclear option which is

58
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:19,470
pretty damn scary do you see this as a
crisis mr. Clasen well I am not sure

59
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:24,840
whether what the definition of a crisis
is if it is we've been in it for quite a

60
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:30,840
while certainly since the election I
have to say Donna I was I couldn't help

61
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,050
but think in the course of the the
Charlottesville

62
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,930
his statements about Charlottesville
when he was so quick to characterize the

63
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,090
intelligence community as Nazis liken us
to Nazis on the 10th of January yet seem

64
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,319
very reluctant to call out the real one
or the wannabe Nazis in this case and

65
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,039
maybe that's I'm being a little
parochial here and defend offensive

66
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,639
about the intelligence community but
that is that's one thought I had so I

67
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,440
think if it is a crisis we've been in it
for quite a while what do you think

68
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,360
other intelligence officials now and
people who have some sway in Washington

69
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,539
what are the conversations they're
having tonight and what will they be

70
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:21,050
having tomorrow you think well I think
the defeats I think many people in the

71
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,849
intelligence community certainly
rank-and-file or worried are concerned

72
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:32,960
about this they're in there and it's a
tradition in the intelligence community

73
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,819
to carry on with the mission
and provide the intelligence that our

74
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:44,270
decision-makers so desperately need and
they'll continue to do that but I think

75
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:50,270
in moments of personal reflection I
suspect there they are greatly concerned

76
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:57,529
about the divisiveness that is taking
hold of this country James clapper is a

77
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:01,190
former Director of National Intelligence
and we thank you mr. clapper thank you

78
00:08:01,190 --> 00:00:00,000
for your service for the country thank
you for coming on this evening
