BRITAIN WANT THE DEAL TO STAND WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCE OF BACKING OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL? CONOR POWELL LIVE IN JERUSALEM. WHAT ELSE ARE WE LEARNING ABOUT THE FILES, CONOR? IT'S NO SECRET THAT BENJAMIN NETANYAHU IS A STAUNCH BACKER OF THE IRAN DEAL BEING SCRAPPED. HE SAYS THESE DOCUMENTS DATE FROM THE 1990s AND EARLY 2000s. AT A TIME WHEN IRAN WAS DENYING THEIR NUCLEAR AMBITIONS AND THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION WAS MADE PUBLIC IN THE 2011 NATIONAL INTELLIGENCEST MITT WHICH CATALOGED ALSO IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM. NETANYAHU IS MAKING THE ARGUMENT TONIGHT THIS IS PROOF THAT IRAN HAD LIED ABOUT THEIR PROGRAM IN THE PAST AND CAN'T BE TRUSTED GOING FORWARD AND RENDERING THE CURRENT AGREEMENT NULL AND VOID. NETANYAHU DID NOT ACTUALLY SAY THAT IRAN HAS RECONSTITUTED THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE JUST A FEW DAYS AGO ON CAPITOL HILL, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MATTIS SAID THAT IRAN IS STILL IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT, THIS IS WHERE THE SORT OF RUB COMES IN THIS ENTIRE DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE AGREEMENT GOING FORWARD. MATTIS AND OTHERS SAY IRAN IS COMPLYING. NETANYAHU AND THOSE THAT ARE CRITICS LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THAT IRAN CAN'T BE TRUSTED. THEY'VE LIED IN THE PAST AND LIE IN THE FUTURE. Shepard: AND THE ISRAELIS AREN'T A PART OF THE DEAL. THIS COMES AS THE TENSIONS ARE GETTING HIGH. ISRAEL, SYRIA, IRAN AND REALLY A DIFFICULT MIX AT THE MOMENT. YEAH, THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHILE THERE'S THIS HUGE INTERNATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT THE IRANIAN AGREEMENT, ON THE GROUND THERE'S ESCALATING TENSIONS WITH THE ISRAELIS AND IRANIANS. IRAN LAST BEEN A HUGE SUPPORTER OF SYRIA. THE ISRAELIS IN THE PAST HAVE LAUNCHED AIR STRIKES ABOUT THE TRANSFER OF WEAPONS TO MILITANT GROUPS. IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, INCLUDING LAST NIGHT, TWO DAYS AGO, THE ISRAELIS HAVE LAUNCHED AIR STRIKES TARGETING IRANIAN FOOT HELD AND PRESENCE IN SYRIA. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT. THIS IS A CONVENTIONAL WAR THAT WE COULD BE SEEING BREWING BEFORE OUR EYES. THE IRANIANS HAVE THREATENED THE ISRAELIS. THE ISRAELIS HAVE SAID THEY WON'T TOLERATE AN IRANIAN PRESENCE ON THE BORDER. WE MAY GET TO A REAL HOT WAR ON THE GROUND IN SYRIA BETWEEN ISRAEL AND IRAN BEFORE WE HAVE A DECISION AROUND WHETHER OR NOT
