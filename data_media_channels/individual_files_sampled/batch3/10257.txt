with less than a year to go until crucial European parliamentary elections French president Emmanuel macron party has suffered a setback losing support to the far-right a recent poll suggests marine lepen 's populist national rally party could win as much as 17 percent of the french vote that's not far behind macrons on marsh party whose support has now slipped to 20% well the trend isn't unique to France in neighboring Germany far-right support has also seen a spike on the back of stronger anti-immigrant sentiment last weekend's the murder of a man is suspected by two migrants sparked a series of rowdy mass demonstrations in the city of Chemnitz support for the far-right AFD party has since surged and it's currently Germany's second largest political force meanwhile a new study suggests that women are a significant driving force behind the swing to the right as RT Charlotte Dubinsky explains across Europe right-wing parties have been gaining ground over the last few years this so-called rise of the right has caused much angst amongst political rivals and now one study written for a political foundation in Germany seems to have put its finger on what's really the problem women as apparently it's a trend of women becoming increasingly lured to right-wing political parties women voters were long thought to be relatively immune to the election policies advocated by right-wing populist and right-wing extremist parties the question is why women become involved in these parties at all whether it's because of women voters or not what seems certain when you look at the polls is that here in France the gap between Mekons lack of public or marsh party and the Pens national rally is getting narrower much narrower well so are women moving towards the right and if they are is it at all surprising prospects are swayed to a norm I don't think that it's surprising because political leaders in power before come from the party which absolutely didn't react to understand the phenomenon of voters shifting rights we need to look in context with growing insecurity we have massive immigration rise of Islamism I see this as a reaction to all these problems for more than 15 years the researchers have been looking at the National Front in France recently rebranded as the national rally to see what attracts women to them the authors concluded that often they simply poorly understood their party's electoral proposals at auction fashion I am a woman I am young I live in the Paris suburbs I think I am at the heart of the problem which means that when I leave home I know what it's like to get mean stairs be insulted over what I wear I'm really facing these problems I know how it is to have your car burned a scooter stolen dig a little further and you find that the group behind the study is affiliated with the SPD the German Social Democratic Party as such much of the work focusing on Germany looked at comparing the performance of the SPD to the anti-immigration anti-eu party the AFD last September when the AFD got record results getting into Parliament for the very first time the election was a bit of a damp squib for the SPD who lost 40 seats so the authors treated this as a bitter lesson for me progressive and feminist viewpoint it seems impossible that a woman in Germany would vote AFD and yet it happens so why did the AFD see such a rise in support and why did women vote for them conservative branch has very constant has a very traditional approach to women in my view women in the traditional views can have many roles and if check into it you will find more elderly women like myself for instance who after they have been raising children and running a family then start to get a new role in politics even the study title the triumph of women question mark could be seen as a warning in itself as it appears to allude to the title of a Nazi Party propaganda film entitled the triumph of the will which chronicled the 1934 Congress of the Nazi Party yet both the women that we spoke to felt that questioning of women triumphing with right or with left-wing movements is not an issue at all no they affirm the triumph of women I don't think it's necessary I think it's more important to talk about triumph of our ideas and triumph or France as that's what prevails today we should not think in these terms male or female woman or man I think it's up to the individual you
