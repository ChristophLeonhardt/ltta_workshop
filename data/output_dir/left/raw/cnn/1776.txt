1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,850
the NFL has all different types of rules
you can't have stickers on your helmet

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:11,400
you have to have your uniforms tucked in
what the president is saying and I think

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,139
the owner should meet and they should
vote on a rule this is about respect for

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,580
our military this is about respect for
our first responders this is not about

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,920
Republicans or Democrats players have
the right for free speech off the field

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,990
on the field this is about respect for
lots of people and I don't understand

7
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,130
why there's rules that when the Dallas
Cowboys wanted to put stickers on their

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,870
helmets out of respect for people there
they couldn't do it but now the NFL is

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,649
saying people should be able to decide
what they want to do and disrespect the

10
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,840
United States flag well two to play
devil's advocate here first of all these

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,789
players don't think they're
disrespecting the United States flag

12
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,910
they think that they are engaging in
peaceful protests of what they see is

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,859
racial oppression and inequities and as
you know Roger Goodell the head of the

14
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,949
NFL and all a whole host of team owners
including Robert Kraft who is a friend

15
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,400
of President Trump have issued
statements supporting their players

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
right to do this and criticizing the
president's comments including Robert

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,049
Kraft specifically criticizing the
president's tone why is this a fight

18
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,360
that the president wants to have I don't
think it's a question of a fight that

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,170
the president wants to have he thinks
this is about respect for the military

20
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,340
and so many people who put their lives
at risk and what the country stands for

21
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,360
and the owner should meet and they
should decide on this rule the way they

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,560
decide on any other rule again you know
for as long as I can remember people

23
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,180
have stood in honor of the country this
isn't about politics if people want to

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,259
talk politics off the field when they're
not working for the NFL they have the

25
00:01:49,259 --> 00:00:00,000
absolute right to do that
