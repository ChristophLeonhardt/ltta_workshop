1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,899
>> THE NRA HAS RESPONDED TO THE
SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE AT THE

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,360
YOUTUBE CAMPUS IN SAN BRUNO
CALIFORNIA AND THEY HAVE

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,660
ESSENTIALLY COME UP WITH ALL
SORTS OF TALKING POINTS AND

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:17,199
EXCUSES AND ORDERED TO ANY REAL
CONVERSATION ABOUT GUNS IN

5
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,199
AMERICA.

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:24,039
THE SHOOTER OPENED FIRE AND DID
NOT LUCKILY KILL ANYONE.

7
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,070
THREE PEOPLE WERE INJURED, THEN
SHE KILLED HERSELF WITH A

8
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,880
GUNSHOT WOUND.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,410
WITH THAT SAID THE NRA HAD AN
INTERESTING TAKE INITIALLY.

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,230
THE FIRST THING THEY WANTED TO
TALK ABOUT WAS YOUTUBE INVITING

11
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,550
HATRED AMONG THEMSELVES.

12
00:00:45,550 --> 00:01:07,369
CHUCK HOLTON SAID 

13
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:14,090
THE FOLLOWING.

14
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:22,179
>> THAT'S GREAT, EVERYONE WHO
WAS SHOT LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, BUT

15
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:23,399
WOULD YOU CARE.

16
00:01:23,399 --> 00:01:28,439
WE WILL MAKE FUN OF LIBERAL
CALIFORNIA, SOME OF THEM WERE

17
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,130
SHOT AND ONLY SOME OF THEM
WERE TERRIFIED.

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,530
BUT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO SELL
GUNS, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

19
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,619
YOU'RE GOING TO TURN AROUND AND

20
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,289
BLAME YOUTUBE ñ

21
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,439
>>THAT IS WHAT THE NRA DOES,
THEY BLAMED THE PARK WHEN

22
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,149
STUDENTS AND ESSENTIALLY MOCKED
THEM AND SET ALL SORTS OF

23
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:51,700
TERRIBLE THINGS BECAUSE THEY
WANTED GUN CONTROL AFTER

24
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,039
SEEING THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR
TEACHERS GET GUN DOWN.

25
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,909
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY WOULD
CONTINUE VICTIMIZING THE VICTIMS

26
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,109
IN THIS CASE.

27
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:05,139
>> THEY SPEND $50 MILLION IN THE
LAST CAMPAIGN BUYING POLITICIANS

28
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:08,179
INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP, YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YOU

29
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,780
WANT.

30
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,159
YOU GET GUNNED DOWN, WE WILL
BLAME IT ON YOU.

31
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,079
>>SO
THEY BLAMED YOUTUBE IN THAT WAY.

32
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:25,019
THEY HAVE BEEN PUSHING THIS
NARRATIVE THAT YOUTUBE IS BAD

33
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,459
FOR A WHILE NOW.

34
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:37,800
YOUTUBE HAD BASICALLY PASSED A
POLICY REGARDING POLICY.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,519
AFTER THE SHOOTING APARTMENT IN
FLORIDA THEY GOT A POLICY SAYING

36
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE
TO PROMOTE THE SALE OF GUNS.

37
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,159
YOU CAN STILL HAVE CONTENT ON
YOUTUBE WHERE YOU TALK ABOUT

38
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:49,159
GUNS.

39
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,940
IF YOU WANTED TO SHOW THE
FEATURES OF A GUN YOU PURCHASE,

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,040
THAT IS FINE BUT WE ARE NOT

41
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,069
GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO USE
YOUTUBE AS AN ADVERTISING TO

42
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:02,109
SELL GUNS.

43
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:12,590
OF COURSE THAT HAS BEEN
MISCONSTRUED BY ñ

44
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,689
HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A VIDEO
FROM NRA TV IN LATE MARCH.

45
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:19,689
TAKE A LOOK.

46
00:03:19,689 --> 00:03:22,420
>>THERE IS NO SECRET THE LEFT OF
AN AGENDA THAT REVOLVES AROUND

47
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:26,269
CENSURING SPEECH THEY DON'T
AGREE WITH.

48
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:30,020
LAST WEEK TOWNHALL.COM REPORTED
YOUTUBE CENSORING OF A FIREARM

49
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,999
SAFETY TRAINING VIDEO, BANNING

50
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:36,799
CHANNELS THAT ARE RUN BY
DONE COMPANIES.

51
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,189
THE NRA'S INSTITUTE FOR
LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS EXECUTIVE

52
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:49,030
DIRECTOR CHRIS COX RESPONDED TO
YOUTUBE CENSORSHIP SAYING THIS.

53
00:03:49,030 --> 00:04:11,359
I WILL TELL YOU CHRIS COX
IS SPOT ON.

54
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:54,639
>> WHAT'S ACTUALLY HEAR FROM
YOUTUBE AND THE NEW YORK TIMES.

55
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:03,930
AND SO THEY ARE MISREPRESENTING
THE TIME ñ

56
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,560
>> LET'S GO OVER SIMPLE THINGS.

57
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,370
THE NRA ACTUALLY KNOWS BUT THEY
ARE DOING PROPAGANDA.

58
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,639
YOUTUBE IS A PRIVATE COMPANY, OR
PART OF GOOGLE THEY ARE A PUBLIC

59
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,310
COMPANY, BUT THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT, THEY ARE

60
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:20,270
NOT THE GOVERNMENT.

61
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,090
IF THEY SAY HEY I DON'T WANT
THESE PRODUCTS THAT KILL PEOPLE

62
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,690
WHETHER IT IS A CIGARETTE OR A

63
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:33,069
GUN OR WHATEVER TO HAVE THESE
VIDEOS ON MY OUTLET.

64
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:39,330
THEY HAVE ALL THE RIGHT IN THE
WORLD TO DO THAT.

65
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,840
WHY ARE YOU STILL CRYING?

66
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,789
I
GUESS YOU THINK YOUTUBE IS SO

67
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:46,639
AWESOME THAT IF YOU ARE NOT ON
YOUTUBE YOU ARE DEVASTATED.

68
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,580
NUMBER TWO, ONE OF YOU EXPECT
THE SAME OLD ABC?

69
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
WHAT WEIRD

70
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,190
STANDARD.

71
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:11,749
ABC BUT LET ME RUN PROPAGANDA
FOR GUN MANUFACTURERS.

72
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:14,190
>> DOES ABC BAN THAT TYPE
OF CONTENT?

73
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,699
>>ABC GETS TO MAKE DECISIONS
ABOUT PROGRAMS THEY HAVE ON

74
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,580
THEIR, RIGHT?

75
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,150
THEY HAVE THE ONES
THEY WANT, AND THE ONES THEY

76
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,720
DON'T WANT ARE NOT ON.

77
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,729
NOBODY GOES AROUND SAYING ABC
CENSORED ME BECAUSE THEY

78
00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:30,159
DIDN'T PUT MY SHOW ON.

79
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:31,850
IT'S WHERE DIFFERENT RULES.

80
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,050
AND FINALLY ENTER A TV IF YOU
DON'T KNOW IS PAID FOR THROUGH

81
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,479
DONATIONS THAT GUN MANUFACTURERS
GIVE TO THE NRA.

82
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:50,439
IS LITERALLY MEANT AS A KIND OF
A QVC OF GUN MANUFACTURERS TO

83
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,330
SUBTLY AND SOMETIMES NOT SO
SUBTLY PUSH MY GUNS INTO THE

84
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,599
MARKET SO YOU WILL BUY THEM AND
THEY WILL MAKE MORE MONEY.

85
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,310
>> TO YOUR POINT ON THAT, THEY
HAVE ALREADY USED THIS SHOOTING

86
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:07,740
AT THE YOUTUBE CAMPUS TO PUSH
FOR MORE GUN SALES.

87
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,470
HERE'S THE TYPE OF FEAR
MONGERING THE NRA USED IN THE

88
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,980
COMMENTARY FOLLOWING THE
SHOOTING.

89
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:31,349
THEY 

90
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:33,590
ARE BLAMING YOUTUBE FOR NOT
HAVING THE PROPER SECURITY

91
00:07:33,590 --> 00:08:13,710
MEASURES TO PREVENT THE
SHOOTER TO GAIN ACCESS.

92
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,979
SO THAT FEAR MONGERING IT IS
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS.

93
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,780
THERE'S ALWAYS CRITICISM FROM
EXTREME GUN ADVOCATES REGARDING

94
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:28,419
POLITICIZING A MASS SHOOTING OR
A SHOOTING SITUATION.

95
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:30,370
WHAT YOU THINK THEY'RE DOING
HERE?

96
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,849
THEY ARE POLITICIZING IT

97
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,960
AND EXPLOITING IT TO SELL MORE

98
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,611
GUNS AND SO FEAR IN COMMUNITIES
AND CONVINCE YOU THAT YOU NEED

99
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:41,120
TO GIVE UP ALL YOUR PRIVACY

100
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,630
RIGHTS AND GO TO WORK WHERE YOU
HAVE TO WALK THROUGH METAL

101
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,160
DETECTORS AND HAVE CLEAR
BACKPACKS AND PURSES AND MAKE

102
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,790
SURE YOU ARM YOURSELF AS WELL.

103
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:58,460
>>THE IDEA IS ANYBODY CAN
SHOOT YOU AT ANY TIME.

104
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,830
THEY SAY GUNS DON'T KILL PEOPLE,
PEOPLE KILL PEOPLE.

105
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,500
THAT IS THE DUMBEST STATEMENT IN
THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

106
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,870
YES IF YOU HAVE AN EX-LOVER SPOT
AS WHEN HE ALLUDED TO THE PERSON

107
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,410
COULD KILL YOU, YOUR WIFE OR
YOUR GIRLFRIEND COULD KILL YOU

108
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,061
WITH HER BARE HANDS BUT IT IS A
LOT HARDER, THAT IS WHY

109
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,740
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GUN CONTROL
HAVE VERY LITTLE DEATHS, LIKE

110
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,670
JAPAN, THEY ONLY HAVE 13.

111
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:38,330
WE ON THE OTHER HAND HAVE
30/30,000 DEATHS BY GUNS.

112
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,330
IT'S

113
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,330
NOT THAT WE HAVE A CRAZIER

114
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:46,990
POPULATION, IT IS THAT WE ARE ñ
OUR ENTIRE POPULATION INCLUDING

115
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:52,640
THE RAGE PERSON ñ WHAT DO THE
GUN MANUFACTURERS SAY?

116
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,570
THE ANSWER IS HUMAN TO THEM
FIRST WITH THE GUN THAT I SOLD

117
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,570
YOU.

118
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,300
UNSURPRISING THAT THAT WOULD BE
HER ANSWER IF YOU MAKE MONEY

119
00:10:03,300 --> 00:00:00,000
SELLING GUNS.
