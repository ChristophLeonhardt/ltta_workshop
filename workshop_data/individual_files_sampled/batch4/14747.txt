Hitler should have took you all every time I read about Hitler I fall in love all over again and salivating over a picture of Hitler in stockings what do these tweets have in common well it just so happens they were all made by pro-palestinian students at McMaster University who are these nutcases and what other incitement and incoherent hatred are they peddling let's find out Nadira Mossad Rwanda Dora and Ezra Benghazi are all students at McMaster University where aside from being infatuated with Hitler they do activism with the group solidarity for Palestinian human rights but you wouldn't note from their Twitter accounts where they seem very anti human rights death to America and white people tweeted Mossad who apparently has a really rough time keeping her story straight she says Arabs and Muslims who refer to our enemies as Jews rather than Zionists make a bad image for the rest of us we're not racists stop okay but then how do you explain these tweets Adolf Hitler if you had taken them all the world would have a lot less problems right now the reason I kept some Jews alive is so I can show you why I killed them in the first place a quote she attributes to Hitler Mossad found out that watchdog group canary mission was keeping tabs on her and called them out publicly in her usual eloquent style but she must have had second thoughts because she appears to have taken some advice from Hillary and hashtag deleted her account her fellow McMaster student in Palestine activist Ezra Benghazi at least admits that what Hitler did was wrong but still seems to have an uncanny fascination with him posting positively about him on more than 10 occasions oh and she's also not a huge fan of Jews I wonder if she appreciates the irony of publicly admitting she'd get rid of a whole religious group in the same tweet where she also criticizes people who lack basic common sense here's Benghazi wondering why she's single I must say it's really a mystery unfortunately Benghazi also deleted her account so we and her future employers only have access to the hundred plus delightful screenshots captured by canary mission the same goes for the last McMaster student kuduro who laments that she wasn't born at the time of the second world war just to see the genius Hitler at work ah poor thing and surprise surprise she also just doesn't like Jews but remember folks these ladies are anti Zionist not anti-semitic honestly it's one thing to have different political opinions test out new ideologies that's what cold is all about feel free to share whatever zany thoughts you have about white privilege or how you think Palestinians do nothing wrong but saying death to whites saying the only good Zionist is a dead Zionist well there's a difference between insight and incitement for campus unmasked I'm Rob schrab shaaka if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus on mass comm
