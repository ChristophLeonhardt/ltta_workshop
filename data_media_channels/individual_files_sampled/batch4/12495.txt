important news the thing that we all care about the most is that there's going to be a fight fight fight fight fight between Joe Biden the vice president's of the United States in this corner and this quarter Donald J macfay strum it's gonna be so great okay so here's how it all started so Biden has been trying to out man from okay Biden understand something a lot of other politicians don't you can't actually just fly over the top of Trump you can't say I'll play the highroad and he'll play the low road and we'll be in Scotland before you can can't actually do that with Trump you actually have to get down in the mud with him so Biden gets this and so Biden speaks Trump's language so there's sort of weird reverse mirror images of one another it's like bizarro Trump is Joe Biden and bizarro Biden is Trump so it's it's very weird so it starts off clip 13 Joe Biden yesterday saying that he would have beaten up Trump in high school which is a real weird thing to say beat the hell out of the president of United States says and then he continues this way so Trump is a fat ugly sob and the only people who talk like that are the biggest fattest ugliest sops in the room funny because you're talking like that now right now senator Biden and so just and the or Vice President bite and then Trump fires back so here's what Trump tweets just come on this is great stuff this is a great stuff go out how can you not love this okay here's anybody trace back this morning it's so it's so phenomenal crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault he doesn't know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way don't threaten people Joe ok so Joe Biden had threatened to beat Trump up actually several months ago saying that if they got in a fight he would take down Trump and now you got the President of the United States imagine this there's a very funny Twitter account that takes all of Trump's tweets and puts them in the format of presidential statements imagine the presidential statement like you wake up from a coma and this is what you see and you're like Oh Donald Trump is in a fight with wait don't force the president you treated that so yeah that's the thing that and I love it I gotta say I love it right he's weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault he doesn't know me he would go down fast and hard crying all the way love it fast and hard crying oh boy yes and actually so so they're now booking a fight and the fight will be booked and we actually have some training footage of what's been going on in the run-up to this massive fight I do a million of these a day so just give me oh man that's hilarious that's Joe Biden pumping iron the guys on the phone he's got like a dumbbell he's pumping iron then it's Trump from WWE just knocking people over oh it's so great so I have volunteered if they do this fight first of all there's no way this is bad for America okay America's already toast when it comes to our vulgar political culture we're done okay Donald Trump is the president Hillary ran Joe Biden is an idiot he's gonna run a meme a win in 2020 oh my goodness okay so I've Ahlan tear okay I volunteer I won't I won't get paid for it I wanna be the announcer on this okay I wanna be announcer on this I tweeted out some of the things that I thought would happen some people tweeted back some lines so not all of these lines that we're about to hear on my own but I do want to announce this fight I think it would say on something like this something like this welcome ladies and gentlemen to the ruckus in the hospice the brawl on Geritol the melee over the jello tray the headlock on Matlock this is a 12-round bout between 74 year-old Donald J Trump and 78 year-old Joseph R Biden fought at the catch weight of 245 pounds Biden has had to drink for insurers per day to make weight Bernie Sanders was invited but there was not enough pudding in the world to ensure that he reached catch weight let's get ready to stumble oh and here we go Trump comes out jabbing insulin Biden hits him with a hard left and Trump is spinning dentures Trump responds the clap to Biden's cheek he clapped on and Biden clapped off Biden's gonna feel that in his walk-in bath tomorrow Trump's out there looking a little bit fuzzy out there as fuzzy as a tennis balls on his Walker and now they're both down on the mat they're both down on the mat they are both napping oh and they're back up again circling each other warily looking for an opening and boom Trump just pulled the old reverse mortgage on Biden and Biden is down Biden is down he's fallen and he can't get up he's punching his life alert button oh my goodness both of them now being carted off in wheelchairs but to be honest both of them were carted in in wheelchairs but still so they would sound something like that I mean wouldn't that be great come on come on great for American politics there's no way this goes wrong are things incredibly stupid yes things are incredibly stupid ladies things are incredibly stupid well in other stupid news it's time for Congress to pass another crappy omnibus package so this is a big omnibus package coming out Congress is no longer capable they actually just passing appropriations bills here is the problem the the Congress the House of Representatives will go forward with appropriations bills they will pass through the normal appropriations process the way that you're supposed to do budgets is you are supposed to fund individual departments and then you're supposed to send a bill to the Senate and the Senate is supposed to fund that individual Department and the president signs it instead what has happened because Mitch McConnell does not have a governing majority in the in the Senate he has 51 votes but they're all fractious instead they just slap everything together in a crap sandwich with a bill that's two hundred and twenty two two thousand two hundred and thirty two pages long and then they give people 48 hours to read it and say we got a vote and they put a bunch of good stuff in there and they put a bunch of bad stuff in there so some of the good stuff that is in there okay there is there is some funding for the wall like a very very very little bit of funding for the wall there there you know there's some things that are being pushed by sort of the left wing of the Republican Party there's increased funding for the child care access means parents in schools program which means that parents will have access to on-campus childcare and the sort of thing if this is if this is your stuff if this is the stuff that you like the the funding is there for the military this is what Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has focused on he says that this is the biggest increase in the military in 15 years the biggest pay raise for our men and women in uniform in eight years we need to rebuild our military so there's an increase in funding for the military it does a little bit of funding for the wall it has a little bit of funding for fighting opioid addiction and it but and it does not in fact enshrine daca so this is one of the things Democrats are saying Democrats are saying they're gonna vote against the bill because the bill doesn't provide full funding for the daca program to allow people in the country legally to remain here working legally but that's because Democrats don't actually want to deal on daca as I've been saying for literally years at this point on this show Democrats want to use illegal immigration as a hot-button issue when it comes to the elections but they don't actually want to solve the problems for illegal immigrants in fact Paul Ryan went to the Democrats and he offered them a really sweetheart deal he offered them three years of funding for the wall so 25 billion dollars over three years for the wall and in exchange three years of additional funding for the daca program right we push off the a con nobody'd get supported Democrats turned that down flat okay and they waited until the last minute to do it and now they'll vote against the bill saying that Republicans didn't give enough so Democrats were offered what they wanted on zakah and would have brought them past the next presidential election actually and they turned it down anyway because they just want to run on this issue here are some of the conservative concerns with all this the freedom clock is the house freedom caucus has officially opposed the Omnibus I've spoken to a lot of members of the house freedom caucus spoken to several senators who have opposed the bill Senator Mike Lee in Utah is opposed to the bill he says it's it's just unconscionable that Mitch McConnell is forcing through another one of these omnibus packages that is essentially a giant crab sandwich then nobody is going to read here's what the freedom caucus says in their statement they say the policy proposals outlined in this 1.3 trillion dollar spending bill are not consistent with what we told the American people we would do when they sent us to Washington many of the policies in the bill are in fact the opposite of what we promised in fact one of the members of the freedom caucus was saying to me yesterday that he was tempted to call this the broken promises Act of 2018 this bill barely provides for border security yet continues to allow federal dollars to flow to sanctuary cities it also includes the fix ni CS proposal without including reciprocity for Americans with concealed carry licenses something congressional leadership promised would not happen it continues to fully fund grants the co 2 Planned Parenthood it makes no changes to reduce Obamacare's burdensome regulations on America's families doesn't get rid of Obamacare regulations and on top of the massive price tag leadership is forcing a vote on this 2230 two-page bill in under 36 hours it's an insult to American taxpayers as well as many rank-and-file representatives who had no say in the omnibus negotiations and the house freedom caucus coming out extraordinarily strong against all of this now will it probably pass anyway sure because the majority of Republicans will vote for it and then there will be a bunch of Democrats who vote for it because the big omnibus package but there's a procedural hurdle they have to jump today it'll be interesting to see whether they are able to do so because in order for that procedural hurdle will be jump every Democrat is gonna jump against it it's possible that this is this bill gets voted down and is brought back for further changes so one of the things that the freedom caucus talks about there is the NIV fix an ICS bill so what exactly is that Jacob solemn over at Reason magazine says this he says legislation aimed at improving background checks for gun buyers may be included in a must-pass spending bill Congress is expected to approve tomorrow or Friday the bill would encourage data sharing with the FBI's National instant criminal background check system is faced a bunch of resistance for a measure that has broad support some the resistance is tactical because Democrats want broader gun control but there are also substantive concerns about the bill raised by supporters of gun rights who worried that it will help block firearm sales to people who pose no threat to others I'll explain why in just a second first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Lending Club so listen we all need a helping hand sometime whether it's unexpected repairs or medical expenses or credit card debt sometimes you just need a little bit of money on relatively short notice well Lending Club gives you access to low rates on loans up to $40,000 for almost any purpose right you need a home loan because you need to hit you need to make all those home

doesn't impact your credit rating you can check the rates that you receive for free so what exactly is the problem with the fixed end ICS program that is embedded in this bill well Senator Cornyn from Texas introduced this last November in response to the Sutherland Springs shooting Cornyn's bill aims to prevent the screw-ups that prevented the sharing of information with the National instant background check system ok they would also encourage sharing of local and state records but for example senator Lee has due process objections to the bill he argues that the Department of Veterans Affairs wrongly identifies veterans as mental defectives which disqualifies them from gun ownerships when they need help managing their benefits right this was a serious problem with an executive order that Obama had tried to put out last year and it was revoked by President Trump that executive order was an attempt to prohibit seniors who had other people do their finances from owning weapon well this sort of does the same thing because the Department of Veterans Affairs will say that veterans have mental defective are mentally defective if they need help managing their benefits Lee says about 168 thousand veterans have lost their second Amendment rights as a result of that particular policy Lee favors an amendment requiring a judge to determine a person's danger to himself or others so nobody's against more transparency in the National instant background check system but the question is what standard is going to be used to deny people a gun and that standard does have to be changed other conservative concerns with this bill aside from the process aside from the fact that these omnibus packages stink that they are garbage and again I think this is less on speaker Ryan because the house has consistently passed appropriations bills and it's more on on Senator McConnell now listen it's up to Ryan to pleased McConnell right he could just tell McConnell listen Bob you're on your own got it right do the appropriations process do what you need to do right and you do this but he's not he's working with McConnell bat-channel this is one of the great intentions that exists on the hill just was in Washington DC yesterday my speech of Georgetown was canceled by actual snowflakes not like the students by like actual snow I spend some time talking with a bunch of congressional staffers and a bunch of Congress people including members of the freedom caucus and this is the difficulty okay people like me actually have a relatively easy job my job is to get on the air every day and to talk to you about the things that are going on and to explain what I think is right and wrong about these bills and to analyze and to stump for better bills when you're in Congress there's also a tendency to try and get things done right the government needs to be funded we need to somehow we need to somehow bridge the gap between what we want and what we can get well sometimes that makes things pretty awkward because there are a lot of Republicans are going to vote from an omnibus package number one because they want to maintain their seats and it's better to have a Republican in that seat than the Democrat and number two because they're seriously concerned about things like military spending so what's the easiest way to do this the easiest way to do this is slap together a crappy omnibus package and then you say to your constituents listen I didn't like a lot of the stuff in there but I liked some of the stuff in there and I needed to vote for it because of that this is why it's up to Mitch McConnell to do a better job of keeping his members in line now what's amazing is that a lot of senators are afraid of Senate Majority Leader McConnell a lot of senators are afraid that he is sort of in de facto control the National Senatorial Committee for the Republicans the NR and the NRC that he is willing to remove money from them or undercut them and so they are willing to go along get along with Senate Majority Leader McConnell but the reality is that if they don't stand up at a certain point and say to McConnell listen we're not gonna vote for these omnibus packages anymore we're going to only vote for packages that we like then you're never going to get anything better the government is just going to continue to grow so the Republican Study Committee stayed up all night last night to try and read through this egregious bill and and some of the stuff that they found in there truly is truly is not great so let's start going through it so here's what they say yeah here's the statement from the Republican from the Republican Study Committee they say some conservatives will be concerned that the bill would fund the federal government at a level that exceeds the BCA discretionary spending caps for fiscal year 2018 prior to the passage of the bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 particularly concerning is the increase in non-defense discretionary spending which exceeds the cap by sixty three billion dollars in fiscal year spending by sixty billion dollars the boost in non-defense discretionary spending represents the largest single year increase in non-defense discretionary since the BCA CAPTA stood be the sequesteration caps were created conservatives may believe this is a reflection of the fact that Democrats have been successful in handcuffing ndd spending to fully funding at the national defense together the omnibus is increase in defense and non-defense spending will increase the deficit by 143 billion dollars this goes to a point that I've been making for a long time Republicans are in the business of cutting taxes they're not actually in the business of cutting spending too many Republicans don't care about cutting spending see it's fiscally hard to cut spending it is politically hard to cut spending now you take a lot of crap for cutting spending you never take crap for increasing spending and this is one of the problems here is that so many folks are focused on being popular and not enough focused on doing the right thing especially in an off-year election right in 2018 there's a fear that Republicans gonna lose the house and then what do you have then you have Nancy Pelosi in charge of making these laws so listen I have a lot of sympathy for Republican staffers and Republican House members trying to figure out what to do here go back to the drawing board give us something better this bill is not up to the standards and what's the point of you winning elections if you're not gonna do anything with the power once you finally have the power right it continues to fund things like local transit programs it funds the DC Opera House it has large spending increases in the agriculture appropriations division which is idiotic it funds the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities it funds the refugee and entrants assistant programs it funds the Social Security block grant program it doesn't change Obamacare in any significant way it does not include dodd-frank rollback language it doesn't include a provision prohibiting funding for administrative expenses of an Obamacare multi-state plan that provides coverage for abortion it doesn't include a provision to prevent to prevent federal funding for ice enforcement to provide for abortions the bill does not contain the conscience Protection Act the bill contains a treasury forfeiture fund no explicit provision prohibition on the gateway tunnel funding the bill doesn't include a provision to prohibit the EPA from implementing greenhouse gas regulations in other words to garbage program to fund the government so that people don't actually have to do anything and now again is there some good stuff here yes I mean we do have to fund defense ok defense has been just slashed tremendously by the number of but by by the Obama era cuts and that's really you know quite disastrous that the Obama did that in the first place we have to ramp up our defense spending again but Republicans are in charge and it's report on Republicans had what they what they pass here go back to the drawing board make some changes I have a feeling you can get at least something better and get at least something better because this is just not a thing right this is just not a this is this is not good enough for a Republican House to pass okay meanwhile meanwhile Facebook is finding itself in additional trouble so Mark Zuckerberg has been on the hot seat for quite a while here and he's continuing to be on the hot seat but not for a good reason yeah I think there are lots of good reasons for Mark Zuckerberg to be on the hot seat I think it's a conservative the discrimination against conservative news outlets has been egregious over the past several months and that's why you've seen traffic drive traffic decline for every conservative website you know like all of them okay but the reason that he's really getting flack is because the left has decided that Mark Zuckerberg is responsible for Hillary losing so let's count all the people responsible for Hillary losing according to the media it's not Trump right Trump didn't win the election he lost the people responsible for Hillary losing are in order James Comey the Russians the conservative media and social media right and so they've finally gotten to the last time there was social media and they're trying to encourage everybody on social media to change the nature of their algorithms in order to prevent conservatives from disseminating information so CNN is hot and bothered about Facebook having allowed companies to gather information from Facebook okay which as I've said everyone does on Facebook if you join farmville on Facebook you are go if you play farmville you are having your information drawn for Facebook every time you click on anything on the internet somebody is gathering that information in order to drive an ad program to you this is how people make money on the internet okay but CNN grows a car Berg and ask can people trust Facebook the answers of course people can't trust Facebook they never could trust Facebook and if you thought that that Facebook was your friend and that Facebook wasn't attempting to market to you how do you think they made their money it's ridiculous Facebook has asked us to share our data to share our lives on this platform and has wanted us to be transparent and people don't feel like they've received that same amount of transparency they're wondering what's happening to their data can they trust Facebook yeah so one of the most important things that I think we need to do here is make sure that we tell everyone whose data was affected by one of these rogue apps right and we're gonna do that we're gonna build a tool where anyone can go and see if their data was a part of this but the 50 million people that were impacted they will be able to tell if they were impacted by this yeah we're gonna be even conservative on that so you know we may not have all the data in our system today so anyone whose data might have been okay this is such nonsense I mean okay we want to know whose data was affected everyone's okay on Facebook because everyone is gathering information for it from you all the time on Facebook it's how Facebook makes their money okay that's this is just silly talk it's silly talk and Zuckerberg pretending Oh we'll be fully transparent Oh we'll finally reveal everything that we know oh we're finally going to show you the inside workings of our car none of this is going to happen none of this is going to happen Zuckerberg is pandering by the way is really egregious I mean he even says that he would love to see regulations on Facebook okay this is just nonsense here's Zuckerberg saying that he's not even sure that they shouldn't be regulated given the stakes here why shouldn't Facebook be regulated actually I'm not sure we should be regulated what the hell okay of course he's sure they shouldn't be regulated why do you think he's attempting to self-regulate right now he doesn't want to be regulated because he's afraid it will cut into his bottom line so what's he doing he's doing what Democrats want so they don't regulate him okay this is outside democratic pressure in order to ensure that social media companies do a Democrats want in a second I'm gonna give you the update on what Zuckerberg posted cuz he posted this long ridiculous letter about about what's been going on with the Cambridge analytical situation I'm gonna read it to you in just a second and analyze it but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at Zeile so March is national sleep Awareness Month I haven't been getting enough sleep which is why over this weekend I plan on using the Z lap zeal is the leader in on-demand massage they want you to know the best way to get the most restorative sleep without a new mattress or fancy

just tremendous they're all licensed it's really terrific okay so Mark Zuckerberg issues a letter yesterday about the Cambridge analytical situation and here's what he says quote I want to share an update on the Cambridge analytical situation including the steps we've already taken and our next steps to address this important issue we have a responsibility to protect your data and then he gives a timeline of events races in 2007 we launched the Facebook platform with the vision that more apps should be social your calendar should be able to show your friends birthdays your maps should show where your friends live in your address book should show their pictures to do this we enable people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some information about them in 2013 at Cambridge University researcher and Alexandra Cogan created a personality quiz app it was installed by about 300,000 people who shared their data as well as some of their friends data given the way our platform works at the time this meant Cogan was able to access tens of millions of their friends data in 2014 to prevent abusive apps we announced that we were changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the data apps could access most importantly apps like Cogan's who no longer ask for data about a person's friends unless their friends had also authorized the app okay so here's what I want to point out here okay what happened in this timeline he goes from 2007 to 2014 he just skips over everything else what huh what happened between 2008 and 2012 we're like there's some things that happened like I seem to remember in 2012 for example the Obama administration using exactly the same strategy in order to gather data on people everybody just keeps right over that just cambridge analytical it's doing terrible terrible things listen so I think Cambridge analytic may have been a little Shady sure do I think they did anything dramatically different as far as I am aware then then the stuff that Obama was doing am I supposed to be angry that people gather data on Facebook this is all nonsense it's all nonsense I mean this is this is all crazy he says in the next month we will show everyone a tool at the top of your newsfeed with the apps you've used in an easy way to revoke those apps permission to your data we already have a tool to do this in your privacy settings now we will put this tool at the top of your newsfeed to make sure everyone sees it so I'm glad they've used the news feed to get rid of all the people you actually follow and now they're going to insert a bunch of crap that they want you to know about but they're not going to allow you to pick the people you choose to follow ok Facebook is is increasingly a disastrous medium and and Zuckerberg seems to have lost control of his own pet project which is an amazing it's an amazing thing I mean there's a reason that the stock is dropping okay so yesterday I had the opportunity to sit down with Paul Ryan and some of the folks who helped us make this happen where the folks my friends over at young America's Foundation which is the exclusive home of my college tours so we were in DC this past week and even though the city's shut down for the snow day yeah helped us make sure that we were able to sit down with speaker Ryan for a few minutes to talk about some of the issues Republicans are working on as well as the future of the conservative movement and here is what it sounds like well we are here with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan which is pretty awesome and we are here in the in the ceremonial room outside the speaker's office where apparently they signed bills and have heads of state which I'm sure you're honored to be here with me you know that there's a lot to talk about obviously the elections are coming up and first let me get your thoughts on on where you think things are gonna head you know it's a long ways away I feel good about our chances midterm elections are hard on the majority party midterm elections for a president's first midterm on average you lose like 32 seats we've got a 24 seat majority so just clearly with the headwind of history in front of us that's not a good thing but I feel like we're gonna have a tailwind of accomplishments to get us into the midterms we can get into the all the agenda but we've done so many things it's a short period of time that will actually made a positive difference in people's lives and I think we're gonna have a really good story to tell not to mention the fact that our candidates our members are battle-hardened they know how to run tough tough races so I feel very very good about where we are so I want to start by talking about some of those accomplishments and then I want to get to sort of the the tactics that you guys are gonna use in the in the election campaign yeah so obviously you know the the top of the list for accomplishments is the tax bill and Democrats losing their minds for the tax bill did not look particularly good so it's fair to point to Nancy Pelosi saying that you've given the American people crumbs and say that that's that's wrong so how much do you think that'll impact that's gonna be the gift that keeps giving justice that just that statement but every single Democrat voted against this I really think they did that because they thought they were gonna psych us into defeating ourselves it's particularly in the Senate and when they kept pushing this line they went so far left so hard progressive that every single Democrat voted against it they're on the wrong side of history and they're on the wrong side of results I've been working on this issue a long time and basically we have this is bigger than 1986 tax reform so this is the first time in 31 years we've done tax reform but it's much more profound than the tax reform we did back then in 1986 because this completely changes the way we tax ourselves on an international competitive basis and this will put such a strong foundation of growth and opportunity and free enterprise in America more so than any kind of economic reform in in my lifetime I'm convinced of that and so they're on the wrong side of history this takes a tax system that was the worst in the industrialized world and gives us a tax system that we think is in the top three of the industrial I'd worlds tax systems that means more jobs in America more opportunity in America businesses coming back to America bringing capital back to America expanding and that is a phenomenally good thing it's gonna get more careers better wages better benefits more entrepreneurship and the Democrats are against all of that well one of the things that's really difficult in the job that you have mr. speaker viously that you are forced to do pot I mean your job is to do policy at the same time it seems to me that elections are very little about policy these days and they seem to be much more about different moral stances and maybe we hope a battle of ideas right how do you plan on tackling there because you know we can talk about our policies being great all day long if good policy one Republicans would never lose but but the problem is obviously that it particularly polls among young people they're really really egregiously bad I mean 70 percent of my audience is under the age of 35 and the polls even among conservative youngsters from our Republicans are not good how are you gonna win the battle of ideas when when you're so focused on talking policy and is there a way to say it's always been my issue I've always strongly believed that elections need to be about choices and about ideas and that's why in 2016 I got our House Republicans together to come up with an agenda and to run on it we called it the better way so that we would have a game plan we would give the country a very clear choice and that if we won the election we would have earned the right to put that agenda in place where two-thirds of the way from doing through doing that right now and that gives us a good story to tell which is here's what we said we would do here's what we did this is what we did in Wisconsin by the way in 2010 the state legislature our governor it's a model that I believe in that I saw work there it's something we're trying to apply here nationally and then we also have to go with new ideas in the election to continue this this reform agenda to disrupt it now the point you made I think is important about what about young people the thing that bothers me the most and I know you've talked about this a bit these identity politics I hate identity politics it's wrong it's morally wrong but also it's insidious and it's in its practice on both sides our job is to reject identity politics and try and replace it with better ideas and idea and aspirational politics I'm a jack camp acolyte I'm a big believer in using our core founding principles applying to the problems and show that their solutions for everybody and that to me is the kind of an agenda and temperament we have to have going into the 2018 elections and so I wanted to ask you about that specifically not in terms of you know efficiencies in economics but about the moral differences that you see between Lumpy's I think these are that's the road issue particularly for young people because you know you and I are both big towns actually you long before before I was and and in a much more prominent way but you're big on entitlement reform form is obviously a difficult thing to sell to a bunch of 17-year olds who never think they will be 60 right you know there's not a seventeen-year-old in America who cares about their social security because they're never going to be of age to receive it and so you know this when I speak to young people I try to on a regular basis it seems to me that what they really want to hear is about this moral differentiation so in your view moving below sort of the the top of the iceberg in politics moving below the water level what do you think is the big distinction between right and left and American politics that needs to be elucidated yeah we believe in equality of opportunity they believe in equality of outcome equality of opportunity means we want to make sure that we use these guiding principles that built this country liberty freedom free enterprise self-determination government by consents which gives you an open economy which gives you freedom which gives you the ability to chart your life the way you want to and we strive to promote equality of opportunity so that the most people can get the most opportunities possible and nowhere else is that ever made more clear than a free enterprise system and then a freedom democratic capitalism like we have like our system is a built on natural rights what what the left believes in and look you're asking it conserving what the left believes in but they believe in equality of outcome the difference in the kind of size and role of government you have between what we're saying and what they're saying is enormous having an equality of outcome agenda means elites in Washington unelected bureaucrats micromanage our lives and are in everything we do in such a way that they believe they have to decide how our what the results of our lives are that's very different that's the sense of equality which is they make things equal in the end and the outcome of things that gives you a stagnant society that gives you a top-down society that gives you this is I would come from Wisconsin which is the birthplace the Progressive Party they believe in all this early 20th century progressivism and Hagel and Bismarck and all these guys could basically think that we're all rubes and doobs and we don't know enough so we need to delegate our power to these these these smart bureaucrats that are insulated from elections so they can harmonize and micromanage our lives and that is an equality of outcome philosophy it's antithetical to our founding philosophy and that at the end of the day is the big difference here and so the fights we have up here in many cases not every one but in many cases are fights of that origin and I think that you know I've I've been watching obviously your political ascent for my entire life because but certainly over the last day you know 15 years and one of the things that I wish that you had the opportunity to speak more about that Steinem because it seems like you're sucked more into speaking about the efficiency on the day job yeah right exactly exactly because we do need thought leaders in the in the conservative movement who are talking specifically about the roots of the left and talking specifically about the the way that natural rights have been overcome by a different regime of how rights are thought about right the difference in positive and negative rights it right so when I go to I talk to schools all the time young people I always say look these are our rights given to us pre government you didn't have to believe in God to believe that they come from God that they're pre government so government can't take those away from us that's us that's where sovereign I don't even like the idea of negative versus positive that's more of a left construct but the idea of government granted rights means we give our power to the government I always say the health care debate everybody says health care czar right if you buy into that premise then we're saying we're giving our power to our government to tell us how when where and under what circumstances we get to exercise that right we're giving the government way too much power than we should that's what the left is saying when they say they want to grant us these new rights the best thing that I found when I talk to young crowds is if we do not get entitlements under control which we can with more choice and competition and free enterprise and choice if we don't get these things under control we are gonna bankrupt the next generation we've run the federal government I round the numbers we've run the federal government for the last 60 years by taking about 20 cents out of every dollar made in America produced in America to pay for the federal government if we do nothing add no new programs do nothing by the time my kids are having kids we're gonna have to take 40 cents out of every single dollar made in America to pay for this government at that time before they even get on to doing something else they want to do with their government so we will bankrupt the next generation I actually had the CBO run numbers years ago and what tax rates would have to be it goes up as high as 88% for tax rates just to pay for this government at that time so I try to explain to people in dollars and cents just what's going to to them if the left gets their way they produced this equality of outcome agenda where we don't reform entitlements and we stick with these kind of command and control systems so I try to find a way of of explaining in dollars and cents what their future will look like from an economic and tax standpoint and how liberty and opportunity will be will be crushed if we stay in this particular path okay so I also before while have the opportunity one they asked you about sort of the legislature versus executive balance because one of the things that I've been critiquing for a long time in the country and I was doing it under Bush I was doing it under Obama I'm doing it under the Trump administration is the is the increasing power of the executive branch is seemingly at the expense of the legislative branch the growing bureaucracy and the and the feeling that the legislative branch over the last century and a half really has abdicated its duty to by kicking it over to the bureaucracy a good example of this being trade you know the president obviously is is pushing a particular agenda on trade this was not in the purview of the executive branch originally this is in the purview of the legislative branch you know the Speaker of the House what do you how do you hope to if you do hope to reestablish the balance originally we did some of we except I wrote the trade promotion Authority law which was it allow us to go get trade agreements and we brought some of that power back into the legislative branch but not nearly as much as we'd like so I can go into the particulars of that but there's a couple of things that we're trying to do here that we've passed out of the house the biggest complaint you'll hear from a house Republican is the Senate filibuster and getting things through the Senate we have this thing called the reins act which we think is sort of the catch-all of reclaiming article one which is 32 state legislators do this you pass a big law it's vague and and then the bureaucracy fills in the details with its rules and regulations and that just then happens and so you end up having all these unelected bureaucracies effectively writing the law as we experience we think that's wrong so what we're saying with this reins Act which is you pass a law the rules and regulations get published and then those rules and regulations come back to Congress for final vote and approval or amendment before they go into effect so that they're consented to by the elected branch of government the people who are elected to write the laws before they go into effect and that holds us accountable to so to that end what we do is we try to in the bills we pass since we can't get that through the Senate yet we try to do it on an individual basis on a bill by bill basis and then I did something else we had these lawyers called the Legislative Council it's the Office of Legislative Counsel it's their actual bill drafters many said share the Ways and Means Committee which is mostly tax laws and health care law's tax laws have to be written really tightly very very prescriptive Lee and so I was worried we were writing too big of a law we were ending really vague laws and giving all this discretion in the Yurok recei except in tax laws so what I did was I promoted the guy who was head of the tax law writing department to run the entire Legislative Council department to train the other lawyers of the Legislative Council how do you write law is really prescriptively right so that we can reduce the kind of open end of the discretion we end up getting the executive branch so I'm trying to change sort of the culture of the way we legislate here so that we're far more detailed than prescriptive to not give all this discretion to the executive branch I really appreciate you taking the time and again you have one of the hardest jobs and all I do not envy you but but I appreciate that you're trying to make philosophical arguments in a time when it seems that a lot of people are actually this is part of my day so thank you okay so that was our sit-down with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan we expect to do a longer sit-down with him sometime in the near future and then I can ask him about things like today's budget bill which is garbage and we can talk a little bit more about what he intends to do to stop the overreach of the Senate which seems to only want to pass these omnibus packages that are that should not really be passed okay so I'm going to talk a

fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation already so a quick roundup of other news so meanwhile 60 minutes is now ready to do its interview with stormy Daniels according to the Daily Mail the head of CBS News said Tuesday that a 60 Minutes interview with stormy Daniels who is of course the porn started the trumped is on its way but that more journalistic work needs to be done on the story David Rhodes is the president over at CBS News I've met him he's actually a reasonable fellow I think he said in a conference in Israel on Tuesday that the first time CBS had confirmed that it interviewed Daniels who has alleged an extramarital affair with Trump before he became president she passed a lie-detector it was an of course he had an affair with her of course okay like okay I'm so tired of people fussing around this issue oh she's lying you're right she's lying as every other porn star all the women are lying there all along it's just not credible I'm sorry Michael avenatti is a lawyer for the actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford last week he tweeted a picture of himself Clifford and Anderson Cooper there no air date has yet been set for the interview but they are preparing Rhodes said he could not imagine what the basis would be for any legal action by Trump's team to prevent the interview from airing this is one of the weird things about the stormy Daniels story Jonah Goldberg pointed this out a lot of people saying well you know Trump denied all the sorts of activity during the campaign but he's not you know he's denying that he had an affair with stormy Daniels but then why would he be paying stormy Daniels 130 thousand dollars in order to shut her up like to talk about an affair they didn't have then he could sue her for libel so what exactly would be the point of any of this it doesn't make any sense at all so all of this continues to continues to roll out over over the Trump White House none of it is obviously particularly good for President Trump meanwhile President Trump continues to fulminate about Russia and Vladimir Putin he is obviously very sensitive about comments made about Russia a lot of people were very critical with the president including me and when he congratulated the Russian President on his dictate his dictatorial victory and in the new fake elections over in Russia he'd been bashed by some people including Ben Sasse the senator from Nebraska who I think says a lot of very intelligent things sass said a couple of things on the floor of the Senate the other day he said number one Trump obviously should not be praising Putin and number two that material should not be leaking from the White House which obviously is true okay there's no way that there should be material leaking from the White it says that people were telling Trump not to and that it was written on a memo in front of him do not congratulate Putin there only a certain number of people in that room if Trump really wants to be sure he can just fire everybody who's in the room when he made the phone call or everybody would seen that memo in any case here was Ben Sasse saying what he said and then Trump responding Vladimir Putin is not a friend Vladimir Putin is a despot the President of the United States was wrong to congratulate him and the White House press secretary was wrong to dump to duck a simple question about whether or not Putin's re-election was free and fair it was not the American people know that the Russian people know that and the world knows that and yesterday when the White House refused to speak directly and clearly about this matter we were weakened as a nation and a tyrant was strengthened sass went on to talk about how and none of this stuff should have been leaked from the White House anyway which is of course true Trump responded by ripping on everybody else about his own comments about Putin so here were some of his tweets on this top he said I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory in past Obama calls melosa ok that's true this is the truth this is the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him they are wrong getting along with Russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing ok so far this is all somewhat fair right they they never would have called for Barack Obama to rip on Putin in fact they were fine with Barack Obama offering flexibility to Putin right before a presidential election and then handing over control of Syria in the midst of a genocide to Vladimir Putin so he's not wrong be critical of the media but this is where he begins to go wrong then he tweets this they can help solve problems in North Korea Syria Ukraine Isis Iran and even the coming arms race Bush tried to get along but didn't have the smarts quote/unquote smarts nothing says says that you are a smart person who can use the word smarts like using scare quotes improperly Obama and Clinton tried but didn't have the energy or chemistry remember reset peace through strength okay that's not a peace through strength means they cannot help us solve problems with North Korea they have dealings with North Korea they cannot help us solve problems in Syria where they've been bolstering the Assad regime in its genocide they certainly cannot help solve problems in Ukraine which they invaded they are not going to help us with problems with Iran considering that they are fans of Iran and as far as the coming arm races Vladimir Putin who's currently testing long-range missiles again and talking about how they're upgrading their entire missile system to avoid missile defense and Trump ripping on Bush and saying he didn't have the smarts is just yuck it's it I'm sorry it's just it's classless and I love that it's that he thinks here thing about Trump Trump thinks that everything comes down to personal relationship because in essence President Trump is a Salesman so he thinks that his relationship with Putin is gonna go well because he's a good salesman okay Trump is a good salesman but that's not how international relations work good salesmanship does not mean that you are better on the international stage proper use of the the iron fist in the velvet glove power and threat of force and the use of those things right that is the essence of diplomacy Trump is not good at those things when he says peace through strength Ronald Reagan's peace through strength was that there would be peace because they knew that if they cross the line we'd bash them in the head that's what peace through strength meant Trump is saying nice things about Putin for no reason then calling it peace through strength that's not what that is and it's foolish you're president Trump to say that okay time for a thing I like and then a thing I hate and then we will be back here tomorrow with mailbag so things I like so this is well not for the kiddies it's probably not for many of the adults there's a show on Netflix called altered carbon i-4 it is it is heavily new defied okay it's like Game of Thrones sound nudity lots of lots of boobies on this particular show and it's not particularly necessary I guess you could make the argument that it's sort of artistically necessary because the whole point of the show is that there is a future in which human beings have a have their personality embedded in essentially a computer chip and that computer chip is in the base of their skull and that computer chip can actually be removed and implanted in other bodies so you actually don't die when your body dies they just take that computer chip and they take all your memories and everything they just stick it into another body and you're good to go and so this body substitution regime is sort of the points of the sort of the points of the series about five episodes in it's sort of noir ish if you like the Blade Runner 2049 it's blade is it's it's that sort of feel it's this kind of dark futuristic vision with neon colors it looks a lot like that that movie here's a little bit of the preview your body is not who you are you said it like a snake sheds of skin we transfer the human consciousness between bodies to live fraternal life I believe I've been down 215 years do you are the property the Bancroft industries you've been provided with this body which came equipped with military-grade Nurik em and combat muscle memory mr. Koh so it's an interesting series two cool-looking series I've heard that it gets kind of twisty near the end of the first season so I'm looking forward to that again it's it's heavily pornified but the whole point here is that it's actually not sexy so the the fact that there is so much nudity actually it's like Westworld it actually makes it not particularly sexy specifically because the the message of the film is a message of the the series is that your body is not all you are in fact it's very little of who you are but it is something addresses some interesting philosophical questions so worth watching if you can stand if you can stand the an nc-17 rated of it okay time for a quick thing that I hate already so there are two quick things that I hate first of all apparently there's a student in the UK who is now alleging that he was reprimanded by his school for watching a video on a public computer of me talking with Dave Rubin hey here's what he said I got reported by someone from watching disturbing hateful content in university premises and received an email from faculty course officer who wanted to be summoned for a student meeting and apparently the student says that because they they were watching this video of Rubin and me and that they were that they were threatened with suspension from school this is certainly crazy but it is unfortunately not all that uncommon the left likes to bump into the category of hate speech anyone that it doesn't like this is why they're trying to say the Jordan Peterson is responsible for hate speech should've said sam harris who's not even on the right is responsible for a hate speech all of it is stupid all of it is nonsense and it's why hate speech legislation like they have in Britain is insanely dangerous because you can just start banning viewpoints that you don't like okay the other thing that I don't like is Eleanor switz had a debate with Jeffrey Toobin over on I believe CNN about the Muller investigation and Dershowitz has been making the Dersch as we used to call him in Harvard Law School has been making the case that I think is a pretty solid case that the that the investigation MoMA investigation has exceeded its legal boundaries and he's now taking in areas where he was not originally designed to go Jeffrey Toobin who's a former gerschwitz student he says that Dershowitz is now a show of the Trump administration they go at it on CNN here's what it looked like come about that in every situation over the past year you have been carrying water for Donald Trump this is not who you used to be and you are doing this over over again in in situations that are just obviously right with conflict of interest and and it's it's just like what's happened with you what conflict of interest I attacked for is not you I'm talking about not you your conflict of interest this contact President Trump for his banning of Muslims I attacked President Trump for leaking material about to Russia I have attacked President Trump for many many things I'm not carrying his water I'm saying exactly the same thing I see yours okay and Dershowitz is exactly correct here of course you know you may disagree through its analysis but it's getting tiresome to watch people who don't like Trump simply suggest that anyone who defends Trump at any juncture even if we've been very critical of Trump and other junctures that those people have now become shells for the Trump administration this polarized political environment is really gross just because you defend Trump when he's worth defending does not mean that you like Trump overall or you think everything that he's doing is right and if you and just because you say that Trump does something wrong doesn't mean that you hate Trump overall you maced elect Trump overall you know we should be able to say what we think is right and what we think is wrong I think tersh which is done a pretty good job of that all right we will be back here tomorrow with the mailbag and look forward to seeing you then i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Mathis Glover executive producer Jeremy boring senior producer Jonathan hey our technical producer is Austin Stevens edited by Alex and Garo audio is mixed by Mike Carmina hair and makeup is by Joshua Oliveira the Ben Shapiro show is a daily wire for word publishing production copyright floor publishing
