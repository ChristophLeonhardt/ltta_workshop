I believe keeping the burger simple is the best way to make a delicious party key elements to making the burger that you can do at home are obviously select good ground beef quality 80/20 80% lean to 20% fat and then season it well before you cook it I think the best method for forming a patty is to play with it as little as possible if you make it too thick you risk it having a too rare in the middle and if you make it too thin you risk overcooking it before you get a nice crust the best seasoning for a burger is to keep it simple before I see I'll just use a generous amount of salt when I take it off I'll finish it with a little cracked pepper the reason I don't use the pepper in the beginning is I don't want it to burn the temperature for the pan when cooking the burger my suggestions to get it as hot as you can get it to get a nice sear on your burger I prefer to have it somewhere between medium rare and medium leaning towards medium I feel sometimes when the burgers too rare the texture for me is a little too soft till I lean towards medium depending on the heat to about three minutes on the first sear turn it over for three more minutes I don't like to stick things in the burger because if you lose the juices pressure that's built up from the hot sear I try to leave it alone as little as possible for the restaurant I have the advantage of having a broiler so when I take me to take the burger off I rest it and then I put the cheese on and just flash it under the broiler for home I would put it on after I flip the burger for the sear on the second side I was put the cheese on top to let it start warming through I think bun pairings should be simple we use a white bun that we make here a little bit of caraway seeds on top I think it's okay to have non-traditional toppings on burgers I think it's fun to experiment play with different flavors here at the monarch room I decided to keep the burger simple whose Bibb lettuce some tomato a little bit of onion and then a sauce that's very simply made with ketchup mustard I do a smoked chili oil that I whisk into it and some pickled jalapenos I don't believe in following recipes to the tee I believe in learning how to experience food and adding your own stuff to it so I'd say have fun trying out the burgers different ways and find what works for you and share it with your friends out of every five people is a target mosquitoes wants your blood
