I'm Andrew Klavan and this is my new novel another Kingdom performed by Michael Knowles in the last episode back in Galliano after his meeting with billionaire Sir Jarrah's go in la austin met the forest king Tora Tania who told him he had a mission to deliver the Queen's talisman to the emperor anastasius so the Emperor could return to restore the fallen country the forest king gave Austin a magic sword and armor and Austin's set off for nether Dale the mansion of Lord iron and his wife Lady Beth array seeing the lady held prisoner in the house Austin impulsively charged off to her rescue and now another Kingdom episode 9 I bent low and traveled quickly I used the trick I had learned down in the sewers where the shit monster lived I focused past my fear plus I kept hidden among the high weeds as much as I could I reached the garden around the house it was a haunted place or felt like one the stems of dead flowers and branches of leafless shrubs wafted and waved around me like phantoms in the lengthening shadows the plants did not seem to have died a natural death but to have been sucked a lifeless by some toxic something or other in the local earth and air as their cold dead tendrils and spines snatched at my arms and legs in passing I lost my concentration I suddenly had this sure clear sense that something terrible was about to happen but I reached the house without being seen at least I thought I had I went to the far right corner and pressed as close to the wall as I could hoping with all my heart that I was out of sight of the windows I'm not sure what I was planning exactly I had some vague and stupid idea of grabbing Beth ray and making a run for it my stallion ought to be able to outrace their carriage right but how the hell was I going to get to her Ike rained my neck to look up at the looming frowning soulless house Ivy grew thick and heavy down the walls twining over the brick facing that capped the corner it was old growth the vines stout and deeply entrenched in the stone I thought maybe it would hold my weight if I tried to climb it hold me long enough anyway for me to grab onto the ledges and gargoyles that shut it out from the second floor upwards I was never much of an athlete climbing I was always the guy who couldn't shimmy up to the top of the ropes in the high school gym girls with arms like twigs used to scramble by on the other ropes around me they would slap the ceiling and slide down while I was still twisting and dangling at the halfway mark but there was no other way to get to Beth array without being seen so I went for it the next few seconds well they were heroin my muscles ached and strained as I pulled myself up the vine hand-over-hand the ivy creaked and rattled like an antique car on a gravel road I felt sure one of the guards inside would hear it the cold stone scraped against my bare forearms and my face the whole house seemed to hang over me like a movie monster claws upraised only that sense that something terrible was about to happen kept me from giving up and letting go I reached the second floor one more pull and then one more and then I reached up stretched my fingers and yes I seized hold of the jutting ledge above me from there I managed to get my knees on to it and grab the next ledge and get my knees on that then balanced precariously I reached up and seized hold of the dragon gargoyle above my head holding on to the stone beasts neck I stretched my free arm out until I could grab the rail of the balcony where bethe array had stood moments before I grabbed with one hand then with the other and my knees slipped off the ledge a split second of terror the earth spinning under me my hands on the rail my feet dangling then with the strength of fear I scrambled up and spilled down onto the balcony through the glass of the doors I caught one glimpse of the room inside a spacious bedroom with a large four poster in it I saw a lady better a lit by the light of two candles kneeling at the sculpted wood and prayer desk on which the candles burned her hands were clasped beneath her chin her Valentine face was turned toward heaven her raven hair spilled down behind her she looks like a saint about to be martyred then the lady turned to the door left to her feet I pulled back quickly against the wall to hide myself from view it was a Lord iron he had come marching into the bedroom with the evil little wizard guy scuttling after him I pressed close to the balcony wall and listened I could hear their voices clearly through the glass doors I've disturbed you at your prayers my dear I'm so sorry that was iron he didn't sound sorry at all what's the meaning of this Winton that was the lady am I your prisoner here is that it my prisoner of course not don't be ridiculous you all my beloved wife and why do you keep him away from me he only wants to help you I know what he wants he uses his power to cloud my mind and shape my will shouldn't a wife's will be shaped to her husband's not by demon magic is that what he did to Carter but a spell on her to make her accuse Austin Lively you're confused you don't know what you're talking about no no now my mind is finally clear it wasn't Austin I saw with cata in the maze that night at all was it I remember now it was you there was a long Arminius silence a chill autumn wind blew off the blasted Heath below me it washed over me where I hid in the afternoon shadows it made me shudder where I stood pressed against the cold stone Lord irons spoke again his voice thick with bitterness and sarcasm my poor fine noble loyal and ever so moral wife who was the first of us to commit adultery I never did i stiffened as I heard the sound of a sharp slap until then I had felt nothing but fear fear for myself fear for her but now a raw fury washed the fear away I had never felt anything like it before not since I was a child anyway like a child I wanted to go through the window and strangle the man like a child I was helpless I stayed where I was liya iron said you think I don't know you played the hole with lively lady better raise voice was thick with shock and with tears I wanted to I should have he's ten times the man you are but I said my marriage vows before God Oh God Lord iron laughed as if it was the stupidest word he'd ever heard in his life then a shuffling movement no lady better a cried out half and fear I thought but half an anger two then another man spoke I knew right away that it was curtain the wizard more than the wind that blew across me the sound of that voice chilled me to my bones I had never heard a tone of such dead malevolence it wasn't violent or threatening or cruel in any way just malevolent just dead look at me my lady don't be afraid don't be foolish you know you can't fight me I can I will she said I was confused before by cutters lies that made me weak but now I know you can't control me if I won't let you there was another long silence I could feel the struggle of wills going on beyond the doors lady better a trying to shield her mind from the hypnotic power of the wizard the wizard trying to wear away her defenses I could imagine the two fields of energy pushing against one another vying for supremacy then damn you this was Lord iron again angry now never mind curtain it doesn't matter I don't care whether you believe me anymore my lady I only need you to be here to draw him you're nothing but bait to me now he won't come he saw me betray him at the trial that's exactly why he will come to set you right he loves you he needs you to know he didn't betray you he'll come and when he comes we'll have him and this will be over and I'll have no more need of you there was a pause a sound of motion iron was leaving iron and curtain both I thought I heard lady better a call after them he won't come he won't but there was no answer and the moment after that I heard her give a wild cry of despair she began sobbing painfully as if something had broken inside her I understood she must have realized that what Lord iron said was true she must have realized that I would come that I would walk right into her husband's trap to try to save her she was right I would lady better-a went on sobbing I wanted to go to her then and there but I remained where I was until I heard the door of the house open below me quickly I crouched down to hide myself beneath the balcony wall I heard footsteps on the dusty drive he will be here I'm sure of it Lord iron said I'll leave the rest to you best if I'm nowhere near just make sure it's Lively who takes the blame sir arriviste answered him with an easy drawl my lord I waited crouched there waited I heard the carriage take off the horses hooves pounding against the earth still I waited silence below sir Erebus must have been standing in the drive the carriage go a few more seconds of waiting and I heard his footsteps as he returned to the house I heard the front door open and closed this was it this was my moment my only moment probably the time was short very short I had to move I sprang up I stepped to the balcony doors they weren't locked I pushed them open and stepped out of the chilly day into the shadows of the candle at bedroom there was lady bethe array she was sprawled on the bed her face buried in her arms her sobs loud and violent how long before sir arriviste and his men came up to check on her minutes seconds better eh I said her sob caught on a startled gasp she lifted her head and saw me she left to her feet austan my darling she threw herself into my arms it was an impossible moment intoxicating surreal I knew we had to go we had to go now right now but I couldn't move from her embrace it was too good to full I couldn't leave it I held her surrounded by her scent swimming in her softness my cheek pressed against the velvet smoothness of her hair my whole body was enveloped in such a cloud of longing it went beyond the erotic into an almost holy devotion and more than that more than that bizarrely in that moment there were other moments too memories I had not lived through cherished experiences I did not know I'd had I caught glimpses of shared glances I heard whispers of whispered secrets I could have remember her half pulling away from me resisting my desire in the name of her vows it was crazy like one of those crazy quantum things you read about on science blogs where phenomena only exist when you're there to observe them lady Beth array and I had had a whole relationship that hadn't actually taken place until now when I remembered it a great passion I'd never felt a grand endeavor I hadn't been there for a whole dangerous conspiracy of good against evil a mission for the sake of the country and the queen that had brought us together in a past where I'd never been I did not remember falling in love with her but I knew I had I had not lived it but suddenly I remembered it maybe some great observer in the sky had seen it all from the beginning but I was only coming to it in this moment in this embrace I knew we had to go but still I didn't go I went on holding her feeling our whole fantastic history coming to life inside me for the first time at last she drew back slightly she tilted her tear-stained face up to me the sight of it filled me with something I had never felt before a fever to fight to fight for her even to die for her she had told Lord iron I was ten times the man he was just then and for the first time in my life I felt I was ten times any man can you ever forgive me she whispered Shh we have to go tell me Austin tell me you don't hate me for what I said in court I was under a spell I let out a laugh hate her I kissed her I thought kisses like that were just in the movies I whispered again we have to go on our fist has his men guarding the stairs I looked around me we'll go out through the balcony then come on we'll find a way down finally finally I worked up the will to push her gently away from me that's when I saw Sir Arabist standing in the doorway crap I thought amazing how quickly all that romantic courage turned to steam and flew away I remembered what Maude had said era vest was deadly with a sword I remembered how fast he drawn his blade and struck me down in the tower room so fast I'd hardly seen it I was unarmed and even if I had been armed unless I was armed with like a 38 I would have been no match for him no match for anyone it occurred to me again occurred to me with a wave of nausea that I was a fool to have come here an unrealistic idiot I was not the guy for this fight or for any fight what was I going to do now sir Arabist stepped forward his thumbs were hooked arrogantly in his sword belt he was smiling utterly relaxed well why wouldn't he be instinctively I pushed Lady Beth Rey behind me arriviste snorted to see it sure he did what the hell good was that going to do her how was I going to stop him not even armed lively he said you might have brought a sword just to make it entertaining look let me get her out of here I said the words came out almost before I thought them that's all I want let her go and then you've got me he lifted a finger to stroke one side of his moustache he pretended to consider it then he said that's one idea or I could hobble you and then kill her while you watch and then have you taken away to be tortured until you tell us where the talisman is yes I think all in all that's the option I prefer this time I saw him make his move I guess I was expecting it the whole time he was talking that's why I saw his hand go to the hilt of his sword just as it in the tower where lady cata died just as before he drew his sword in a flash of steel and swung it in a cruel arc at my head I threw up my arm in a useless gesture of defense and with a loud clang his blades struck the blade of the sword that was suddenly magically gripped in my hand I gave dat my blade crossed with his it was the Queen's sword the silver sword I had drawn from the heart of the oak just as it had vanished into me so it had sprung out of me in the moment of need likewise the mercurial Armour that had been sucked into my body now emerged from my skin and closed me head to toe in liquid metal whoa I thought and sir Erebus looked like he was thinking something similar because he was standing there just like I was standing there staring gaping at the sword just like I was but I understood it first I recovered my wits first I lifted my foot high and kicked him in the stomach I don't know where I came up with that move something I once saw on a movie fight scene maybe I don't know I just thought of it and I did it I planted my foot hard and sir Arabists leather clad belly I don't think it hurt him much but it was a square on blow and it sent him reeling backwards I didn't charge after him it would have been suicide I mean yes I had a sword now but I hadn't the faintest idea how to use it if I got into a duel with him he would cut me to pieces armor or no he was already recovering his balance already straightening on his feet ready to fight I grabbed Lady Beth Ray's hand and rushed with her across the room it was a desperation move how was I going to outrun Arabist how was I going to get past the other two guards I had no idea but this was the only thing I could think of sword in one hand lady in the other I reached the bedroom door I swung Beth array through it run I cried and I left after her into the houses hallway except not the hallway not the house I suddenly wasn't anywhere I recognized then I did recognize it my Nissan I was in my Nissan sitting behind the wheel of my car in the driveway outside sir Jarrah's goes hilltop ranch I didn't know whether to scream at the insanity of it or to say a prayer of thanks for my salvation second after second I just sat there in the car panting with terror and excitement my heart fluttering my chest as if I just awoken from a nightmare which I suppose in some way is exactly what I had done except I'd awoken from a nightmare into another nightmare because now I was back in LA and I had to find the book another Kingdom or Sarah the girl boy assassin would be set free to torture me to death unless I was teleported back to Galliano first then sir arrow vest would torture me to death either way there seemed a high probability that I was going to be tortured to death it took me three tries before I could steady my violently trembling hand enough to slip the key into the ignition and get the Nissan going shattered trembling confused beyond reason I drove home through the snaking darkness of cold-water Canyon I kept telling myself I needed to think think think but I couldn't think bouncing back and forth between the fatal dangers of Los Angeles and the fatal dangers of Galliano had left me in something like a state of a waking coma I stared through the windshield without seeing the road I steered the car without knowing where I was headed my mouth hung open like an idiots math or a drunks I did everything but drool and I probably would have drooled too if I'd thought of it but I couldn't think of anything nothing at all somehow by habit I guess I made my way back to North Hollywood I found my apartment building I drove into my garage and parked I reached for the handle of the car door and I froze with my fingers on the metal the old Galliano and door way problem what if I step through the door and was back in nether Dale sir arriviste had been two steps behind me at most his sword drawn a second after I returned he would be on me he would strike me down a second later Lady Beth Rey would only live a few moments after that i sat there in my dark car surrounded by dark cars in the half-lit garage I didn't know what to do finally I went into my pocket and brought out my phone the glow of the screen filled the Nissan's shadows I searched for a video how to fight with a sword guess what there was a whole series of three-minute instructional sword fighting videos no kidding yay Internet I sat in the car and watched videos each video covered one type of blow or defensive move I watched each one three or four times trying to memorize the instructions when I had gone through six of them as many as I thought I could remember I set the phone on my lap and closed my eyes I imagined how I would use the moves in the video to fight with Sir Arabist there was one I liked especially a forehand slashed down to the hand that knocked the sword aside than a back slash to the face I knew I would only have one chance to catch my opponent off guard before he killed me but I pictured in my mind what it would look like if I pulled it off it calms me down a little a little anyway I stuffed the phone back in my pocket i sat and stared at the card or some more I realized that the moment I passed through it might be the moment of my death I took a deep breath I opened the door and stepped out no transformation no galliano I was still in Los Angeles still in the garage I stayed there a few more minutes I rehearsed the sword fight moves I had learned in the videos moving about the concrete floor imagining the sword in my hand slashing my arm down to my opponent's wrist up to his face after a while another car came into the garage and I was caught in its headlights playing at the duel it made me feel like an idiot I headed into the building I went up to my apartment each time I passed through a door the building door the elevator door the apartment door I braced myself each time I thought I might be hurled back into the hallway of nether Dale with Sir Arabist right behind me I couldn't even enter the bathroom in my apartment without being afraid it would send me back to die at the point of Arabist sword by the time I went to bed I was a nervous wreck I lay there wide-awake watching the sword fighting videos on my phone again and again and when that exhausted me I put the phone down and just lay there staring into the darkness my weary mind returned to Lady Beth array the feel of her in my arms the sight of her tear-stained face turned up to me what a woman she was so feminine so passionate so steadfast honorable and loyal I had never met anyone else like her how was it possible I had won her love a Hollywood nobody liked me in those snatches of half memory that had come to me out of nowhere when I was holding her I seemed a different person better braver more heroic how would I ever be able to live up to that quantum man whom I had never been but only remembered in a way I thought bitterly I'd be lucky if Sir Arabist killed me the minute I returned at least I'd never have to see the disappointment in Beth arrays eyes when she realized I was not the man she thought I was it was almost dawn before I drifted off to sleep the book that was my first thought when my eyes opened in the late morning somehow I had to find that book another kingdom if I didn't find it and if I didn't find it fast sir Jarrah's go would let Sarah kill me who knows Sarah was so crazy and so angry he might come after me and kill me even if a Rosko didn't let him that is if I didn't flash back to Galliano and get killed by Sir Arabist first but where was I supposed to find the book I had no idea where it was I didn't even know where to begin looking I went to the bathroom after hesitating on the threshold for several minutes afraid I might be flung back into the sword fight I brushed my teeth and shaved looking in the mirror I looked like crap no sleep eyes full of worry my hand so unsteady I nicked myself with the razor twice I hesitated on the threshold again before I could leave the bathroom just stood there a full minute before I could work up the courage to go through the door I felt like I was going out of my mind already exhausted I plopped down at my desk miserable I ran my hand through my hair I gazed dolefully out the window I saw the black Mustang parked across the street Sarah was at the wheel the killer was staring up at me his eyes bright in his kittenish face his teeth bared in an insane grin I had to get out of there and fast I didn't know whether Sarah had come to kill me or just to watch me for a Rosko I didn't know if Sarah knew either but I knew if I stayed in my apartment alone and did nothing I'd be completely unprotected I couldn't call it police it would be sure to get back to a Roscoe no I needed to get myself to a public space somewhere there were people witnesses who might make Sarah think twice Hitchcock's it was past breakfast time my people might have come and gone but there'd be others there and Skylar would be there working the morning shift Skylar might be pissed off at me because Jane Jane away loved me instead of her but I still thought she'd probably object if Sarah killed me in front of her if only because she wanted to do the job herself it was an unpleasant journey I was afraid of every doorway afraid it would take me back to nether Dale afraid Sara would be waiting for me on the other side down in the garage I searched under my car for a tracker I didn't find one but it didn't matter much Sara didn't need a tracker he and his Mustang were still right there at the curb when I came driving out of the garage the minute he saw me the slender blonde pulled away from the curb and followed after he wasn't subtle about it either he kept his front fender pressed close to my rear I could see his bright eyes an eerie grin and my mirror stopped at a traffic light I saw him powdered me flirtatiously and wink he followed me right into the restaurants parking lot but he didn't get out of his car he just sat there behind the wheel just watched me as I walked to the restaurant door I went into the restaurant without thinking about the door there are so many doors to walk through in life you can't be afraid of all of them even if you know one of them might be your last it was a relief to be in my old hangout the familiar brown wood walls and white fairy lights the TV news dancing on the liquor bottles behind the bar it was all so familiar it created an illusion of normalcy and even safety Sara wouldn't just walk in here and open fire I didn't think he would anyway there were plenty of starving artists sitting at the tables drinking their coffee concoctions under the old suspense movie one-sheets even a couple of my disreputable crew were still at our usual place by the kitchen door Ted Wexler the aspiring asshole agent was scrolling through the emails on his phone with one hand and picking at the crust of some dry toast with the other the inscrutable Beauty Ren Yin was inscrutably blowing the steam off a cup of tea while inscrutably staring into space a living eurasian stereotype Skylar pushed out of the kitchen just as I was sitting down with them what the hell happened to you she said scowling both Wechsler and Ren yin glanced at me with minimal interest and looked away holding a tray in one hand Skylar stood next to me her enormous figure hanging over me like a tight deadline with her free hand she gripped my cheeks painfully and turned my face to her uh-huh I said the words squeezed into incomprehensible 'ti by her painful grip your forehead the bruise is gone it's not even discolored oh right in spite of everything that had happened only a day had passed since I'd last seen her some nude nymphs bathed me in the healing water of a magic grove then stroked me to the greatest orgasm of my life renewing my body and soul I didn't tell her I said instead iose her wha what Schuyler barked I pulled her fingers out of my cheeks I guess it wasn't as bad as it looked I said Schuyler continued to stare down at me with harsh unforgiving skepticism but it made no difference even if I told her the truth she wouldn't believe it a second later she lifted her eyes I saw her angry cherub face go soft beneath her spiky red hair and I knew Jane Jane away had come in it was an intricate moment I turned and saw Jane by the door in all her slumped mousy secret loveliness there was no mistaking the pleasure in her eyes at the sight of me even though she shyly turned away so I wouldn't see there was no mistaking Skylar's gloomy brooding as she hurried off to deliver someone's breakfast Wexler smirked ren yin watched through her tea steam the whole thing was fraught with social complexity myself it was strange as soon as I saw Jane I knew something had changed in me since yesterday I had changed and my feelings toward Jane had changed as well I couldn't figure it out just then now with all the threats hanging over me from every side not with my mind churning and burbling with anxiety but before the sight of Jane had always filled me with guilt and uncertainty I knew she liked me and I well everyone liked her she was so incredibly sweet so nurturing so kind the sort of girl you want to build a life with but was I willing to build a life with her with anyone was I willing to risk hurting her if I wasn't ready and not to sound like some shallow Hollywood cliché but well what about my career Skylar was right about Jane was the sort of woman who would give all of herself to her family her husband and children was I ready to support a woman like that a family like that I had always fancied myself a high-minded artist in the making what I give up that dream to make the money we'd need those were the questions that had paralyzed me before just yesterday but now I was different the misty nymphs of shadow wood had brought out some natural manly something in me that I had never quite felt before and my bizarre preternatural memories of Lady Beth are a and my memories of the man who was me when I was with Lady Beth Rey in the past if you get my drift had planted a new idea of myself in my brain or maybe an old idea or maybe just a different idea than the one I'd been operating on until now anyway the upshot is when I saw Jane this time I felt something a quick deep bright premonition that she was going to be mine and not mine in a polite modern equitable easygoing partnership sort of way either but totally mine in my possession and in my care body and soul forever well the feeling came and went just a flash of insight here and gone a split second shock of raw organic understanding it was crowded out immediately by a fresh rush of worry about what I was going to do next still a sort of undercurrent clarity lingered as I watched sweet Jane in her oversized sweater and ugly tennis shoes shuffle across Hitchcock's to our table she stopped when she reached me her gentle blue green eyes went wide her cheeks pink and Austen your head she said I know it healed fast didn't it well yeah I mean it's crazy how fast I pulled out the chair beside me sit down with me Jane I need to talk to you holding her teacup to her lips Rennie Ann's eyes shifted toward us inscrutably brightened inscrutably and shifted inscrutably away Jane sat down next to me all earnest and caring and Jane like what's the matter sweetheart she said you'd look worried it wasn't a romantic sweetheart it was just Jane being darling Jane she probably didn't realize yet that one day soon I was going to lay claim to her flesh and spirit and fill her belly with children and redefine her life by the force of my passion actually I wasn't sure I knew that either but I sort of did know it too like I said the scenery in my brain was moving too fast for me to get a good view of it ah what's the matter sweetie tom-toms Wexler mimicked her making a kissing noise in his best asshole and training manner shut up wax said Skylar she had returned to the table in order to assure Jane that her morning yogurt would fly to her with wings as Swift as meditation and the thoughts of love she loomed immensely glaring mournful death first at Wexler then at me then she returned to the kitchen Jane went on gazing into my face expectantly in that sisterly motherly love early Jane way of hers waiting for me to tell her my troubles so she could kiss them and make them better not for the first time I reflected what a waste of womanhood it was for her to spend such sweetness taking care of two movie stars who didn't give a crap about her I've got a problem I said tell me it's this script I'm working on I've written myself into a total corner and I need to talk it out with someone I dreamed up this story on the spot I knew it would sound natural Jane was sometimes dragooned into reading script submissions for her movie star couple Dave exes I had used her as a sounding board for ideas myself once or twice she was at least as good a story analyst as I was it's been keeping me up at night I can see you look so tired snookums muttered Wexler Skylar came out of the kitchen again and set Jane's yogurt in front of her Jane barely interrupted our intense eye contact to smile her thanks which made Skylar glower at me before she charged back through the kitchen door okay I said it's about this ordinary guy who finds himself in a totally locked room with a murdered woman and he's got amnesia so he doesn't know how he got there oh that's original drawled Wexler rolling his eyes it is the way I do it I snapped at him stop now whacks Jane told him quietly Wexler rolled his eyes again but he shut up and returned his attention to his phone because Jane was Jane so now he's on the run and the police are after him for the murder I went on it all he knows is he's got to find this book that will explain how he got into this situation but the woman who has the book has totally vanished and he doesn't even know where to begin to look for her is the woman with the book hiding from him no no she actually wants him to have the book but she's afraid if she gives it to him her enemies will get hold of it Shane gave a slow nod raising her eyes thoughtfully to the ceiling I used the moment to steal a glance out through the glass of the restaurants storefront to make sure sara hadn't left her car to come and get me there was no sign of the kitten faced assassin out there but as I was turning back to Jane my eyes passed over the television set behind the bar my lips parted my breath caught I felt the blood drained from my face the local news was on and they were covering the murder of Sean Gunther there was a picture of the house in the Hollywood Hills where I'd been last night there was a video of Gunther's body being carried out on a stretcher a chyron under the picture red death of an author it wasn't that I'd forgotten gone through his murder not exactly it's just that so many other dangers had been weighing on me it had kind of fallen to the bottom of the pile I hadn't reported the murder of course because Orosco had hinted he'd have me killed if I did but now for the first time it occurred to me to think about how that would look I'd witnessed a man being killed and I hadn't said anything if the police found out I'd been there okay how about this said Jane what I said startled I turned from the TV to stare at her my head's swimming if the woman actually wants your hero to find this thing but she's in hiding because she's afraid of her enemies would it be plausible for her to find a way to slip the hero a clue a clue i murmured gormless Lee yeah you know something subtle enough to lead him to her but without the bad guys catching on I like what Jane smiled she couldn't hide how beautiful she was when she smiled well come on sweetheart you're the writer that's your superpower come up with something I went on staring at her the thought of Gunther's murder was still pinballing around in my head and for a second I couldn't even take in what she was saying but then I did take it in hand well it was nuts I know but yes it was plausible when you thought about it what Jane was suggesting it made total sense if Ella Nevermore had sent me another him but had withdrawn it when she realized I worked for a Rosko maitain she have left a trail to help me find it again a new thought came to me at once the picture the photograph of Ellen and Gunther's phone you know what I said softly you're right that's good Jane that's actually possible that might work Jane's face went bright she was so pleased to have helped me even her schlumpy getup and her limp hair couldn't hide how lovely she was just then was it possible I wondered could Ellen evermore really have left that picture with Gunther in order to lead me to her to her and another Kingdom I've remembered the shot she was in a museum she was standing in front of the painting on the wall behind her I took out my phone I called up my search engine I tapped in a description of the painting as I remembered it a man and a skin of some kind standing between two women yay Internet it came up almost at once the choice of Hercules there were several paintings of the subject but the one I wanted was right here in LA at the Getty Museum Hey look it's you Wexler said what said Jane and I in unison wex held his phone out toward us I felt something stick in my throat as I looked at the picture on the screen it was a grainy photo like a photo taken from a security camera it showed two figures standing at the gate of Shaun Gunther's house it was me in the Cole girl the girl who had seized on my arrival to make her escape Wexler drew the phone back and read the photo's caption aloud police are looking at question two people who were outside the author's residence on the night of the murder so like you killed a guy now I didn't kill a guy I said trying to make it sound as if the idea were ridiculous that did sort of look like you said Jane it is you said Wexler it's not me I lied wex showed the picture to ren yen she shrugged her graceful shoulders inscrutably so many thoughts were racing through my mind at once I could barely make sense of any of them would the police be able to identify that picture had I left fingerprints were my fingerprints on record I had called Candi philocan at mythos to get Gunter's address would she hear about the murder see the picture and call the police maybe I needed to go to the police myself no matter what Orosco was threatening but how could I know I knew what I had to do I had to get to the Getty I had to see if Ellen evermore had left a trail for me there to lead me to the book I didn't know couldn't imagine what good another Kingdom would do me I only knew it was the one thing that linked all my troubles together Galliano Gunther Oh Roscoe everything if there was a cure from the madness that was happening to me it was in that book I have to go I said sure said Wexler run away but you won't get far just shut up
