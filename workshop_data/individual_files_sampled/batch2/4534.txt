when we talk about sexual assault sexual misconduct here one out of every six women stats wise our victims of attempted rape or rape just two to ten percent apparently these reports are false accusers right are made up basically in just thirty five percent of all rape or sexual assault cases are actually reported when you put those all together the pull back piece of this is that the number of rapes and sexual assaults that are not reported far outweighs the number of men being falsely accused so how did the president's comments play given that context well I I mean I think I've been saying all along that the charade that they continue to go through with this Kavanaugh nomination is basically like the GOP and the president carrying around a big sign saying to women we don't care about you you don't matter and I will say I was particularly offended by his statements last night because I have a son I have a son and a daughter and I think that justice in this case understanding a full thorough FBI investigation finding a nominee that has absolutely not under suspect of this is as important for my son to grow up understanding his role in the world as it is for my daughter to feel safe explain that because one of the things that you have heard from some for example Republicans has been the question of well what if this was your husband or brother or son who was falsely accused wouldn't you be acting and feeling differently about this so I posed that question to you yeah absolutely I mean any mother is gonna feel defensive on behalf of her son but I think what any mother would do is what we've been shocked that Brett Kavanaugh hasn't done which is demand a full and thorough investigation with every witness available to be interviewed by the FBI for as long as it takes because the thing I would care about most is that my son could stand behind whatever the results are and the way that this is proceeding casts a long long shadow of doubt and pain over women who as you say are loath to come forward because they get attacked the way the president attacked dr.
