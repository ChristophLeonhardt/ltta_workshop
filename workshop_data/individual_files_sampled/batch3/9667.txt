CHANNEL AT 6:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME. IT IS ONCE AGAIN ELECTION SEASON UPON US. ABBY: YOU CAN FEEL IT. ALL RIGHT WELL THE ANTI-TRUMP COMEDIAN MAKING HER POINT CLEAR IN HER VILE ATTACKS LAST NIGHT AS THE HOST OF LAST NIGHT'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S DINNER WATCH THIS. A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TRUMP TO BE IMPEACHED I DO NOT BECAUSE JUST WHEN YOU THINK TRUMP IS AWFUL, YOU REMEMBER MIKE PENCE, YOU GUYS GOT TO STOP PUTTING KELLYANNE ON YOUR SHOW. ALL SHE DOES IS LIE. WE'RE ARE GRACED WITH SARAH'S PRESENCE TONIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY I'M A LITTLE STAR STRUCK. I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LIDIA. PETE: OKAY, WELL, FELLOW COMEDIAN IS THE WRITER AND PRODUCER BEHIND KEVIN CAN WAIT. HE JOINS US NOW TO REACT. ABBY: IT'S A GREAT SHOW GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THIS MORNING. PETE: YOU'RE THE RIGHT GUY TO TALK TO. YOU KNOW HOW TO WRITE JOKES AND DELIVER THEM. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF LAST NIGHT? IT WAS HORRIBLE. IT WAS JUST STRAIGHT UP HORRIBLE THE WHOLE ROASTING HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. IT'S NOT A GENTLE, YOU KNOW, HEY WE'RE BOTH IN THE SAME BUSINESS I'M KIND OF MAKING FUN OF YOU. IT'S LIKE THE PERSONAL ATTACKS, IT'S VICIOUS, IT'S NOT FUN. IT'S NOT FUNNY. I DON'T KNOW WHO BLAMES TRUMP FOR NOT GOING? I DON'T. IT'S LIKE BEING INVITED TO A RESTAURANT WHERE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET FOOD POISONING YOU KNOW IT. WHY WOULD YOU GO? ABBY: DO YOU THINK THIS SPEAKS TO A BROADER PROBLEM WE'RE SEE ING WITH COMEDY TODAY? ROB SCHNEIDER WHO I'M SURE YOU KNOW IS AN SNL ALUM, AND HE SAYS SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE IS RUINING THE JOKE, HE SAYS THE FUN OF SNL WAS ALWAYS YOU NEVER KNEW WHICH WAY THEY LEANED AND YOU KIND OF ASSUMED THEY WOULD LIEN LEFT AND LIBERAL BUT NOW THE CAT IS OUT OF THE BAG AND THEY ARE COMPLETELY AGAINST TRUMP WHICH MAKES IT LESS INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE DIRECTION THE PIECE IS GOING AND IT IS SO PREDICTABLE TO HIS POINT, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT? I AGREE WITH IT 110%. I DON'T KNOW ROB. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING THE SAME JOKE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THERE'S ZERO SURPRISE. LEAVE IT TO THE WRITERS OF SNL TO LIKE RUIN A KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE. LIKE KNOCK-KNOCK, WHOSE THERE? ALEC BALDWIN AND HE HATES TRUMP. IT'S THE SAME THING. IT'S JUST PREDICTABLE. MAN DID A SKIT WHERE HE WAS RONALD REGAN AND HE PORTRAYED REAGAN AS THE SMARTEST MAN ON THE PLANET WITH UNLIMITED ENERGY IT WAS HILARIOUS. YOU NEED AN ELEMENT OF SURPRISE OR IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY AND THEN IT'S JUST A PERSONAL ATTACK AND BORING AND A YAWN FEST. GRIFF: MICHAEL LET ME TAKE YOU QUICKLY INTO THE WRITING PART OF THIS BECAUSE WHEN IT CAME TO MICHELLE WOLF'S SPEECH IS IT YOUR SENSE THAT THEY WROTE WITH A REAL INTENT TO EXPRESS THE HATRED THAT CAME OUT OF THAT, THAT THEY DIDN'T TRY AND WRITE SOMETHING THAT WILL BE FUNNY AND EDGEY BUT ACTUALLY HATEFUL. THEIR WRITING FOR THEIR FRIENDS IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. TODAY I'M SURE THE GIRL WHO HOSTED I DON'T EVEN KNOW HER I DON'T KNOW HER NAME, SHE'S GOING TO GO TO HER FRIENDS I SAID IT. I DID THE JOKE AND SARAH WAS RIGHT THERE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S FUNNY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SHE'S NOT EVEN TRYING TO ENTERTAIN ANYBODY SHE'S GOT AN AGENDA SHE WANTED TO HURT PEOPLE' FEELINGS SHE WANTED TO PLANT HER FLAG ON MOUNT HURT A LOT AND BRAG ABOUT IT THE NEXT DAY. ABBY: YEAH. IT'S BORING AND IT'S SAD AND IT'S NOT THE SPIRIT IN WHICH IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. EVERYBODY IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A GOOD TIME AT THE ROAST AND SADLY THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. YOU WANT TO SMACK THE OTHER PERSON DOWN AND HAVE AN AGENDA. PETE: THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT BUT IT'S PREDICTABLE AND BORING WHICH IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP IN MICHIGAN TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE BUT INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING TO GO NEXT. WHY CAN'T COMEDY MAYBE LEARN FROM TRUMP? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW BUT I HAVE MORE FUN WATCHING A TRUMP RALLY THAN I DID THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S DINNER. HE'S A BETTER COMIC. ABBY: IT'S A GREAT POINT. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US AND KEEP DOING YOUR SHOW BECAUSE IT MAKES US LAUGH. WE NEED SOME REFRESHING COMEDY TODAY. PETE: THANK YOU, SIR.
