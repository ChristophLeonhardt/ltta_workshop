47
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,340
gotten it is like sixty percent if that

48
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,060
I've never completely drained this thing

49
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,250
when you turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and hold down the</font>

50
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,590
power button and it illuminates with a

51
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,870
little blue LED backlight type thing to

52
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,909
let you know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent is left</font>

53
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then also it comes with a little</font>

54
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,810
flashlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> too if you double tap on the</font>

55
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,269
power button it creates a little

56
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:44,280
flashlight and then to turn it off you

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,010
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap once this little guy is pretty</font>

58
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,109
affordable especially I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think for what</font>

59
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:51,750
you're getting like I said he holds a

60
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,420
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of charge you can get him from</font>

61
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,930
amazon prime for 2399 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think even</font>

62
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,609
if you're not a prime member and pretty

63
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,920
sure that's still the set price you just

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,709
won't get it in two days two USB ports

65
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:09,450
to plug in for your out one of them is

66
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,909

69
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,099
