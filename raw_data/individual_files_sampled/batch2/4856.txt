why is everybody so obsessed with the Prezi nine states that they can't even begin or finish a sentence without mentioning his name five times it's kind of weird and it's and it's infecting people on on the news now who fancy themselves security experts that was counsel to the president Kelly and Conway pottering why people want to talk about the president want as a strong word I think the most interesting thing about Kelly Anne is a Washington Post report about her marriage that was out this week in the post this is from the piece Washington Post she works for Trump he can't stand him this is life with Kelly Anne and George Conway they report here at the Conway's it's a house divided she's Trump's loyal advisor the woman who carried him over the finish line to the White House he is one of the president's most notable conservative critics and wishes he had never introduced his wife to Trump in the first place now I disagree with my mom and dad Donna Edwards about Donald Trump that I do not live in their home or their timezone I cannot imagine this fight in this marriage I'm sure they make it work but it's stunning to me to read and they'll invite it we should say they invited the Washington Post in this was a planned piece that they collaborated with The Washington Post a story they wanted to tell I'm guessing and then they're angry that it was told or at least she is I feel like I'm on an episode of that old show can this marriage be saved I mean you submit we spent time you know sort of looking at Kellyanne Conway and we've got you know George Conway trolling the president Melania Trump with her be best campaign which i think is also trolling the president and it seems that there's nothing in this White House that really is off limits and that is part of their creation and their fault it's not because we're asking for it and there's actually point nothing in the report this is just there's anything awry in Kelly Anne and George Conway's marriage they just disagree about Donald Trump the contrary I allow me for a moment to be the most cynical person in the room you are a Kelly Anne Conway George Conway you may or may not have legitimate differences about the president say it's who knows but let's say you do yeah you are you are contemplating your future me at some point there will not be a Donald Trump presidency at some point you might want to leave the White House of your Kelley on Conway let me think about what's the way in which I would maximize my revenue my net worth and I'm looking for models James Carville Mary Matalin that's worked pretty well for those guys oh gosh Dave and James and Mary I love them both they're both friends of mine and they genuinely she's generally conservative he's generally liberal but they have made an industry out of their different about the oddness of their marriage and that she hated Bill Clinton and he loved Bill Clinton and etc throughout the George Bush W Bush period throughout you know those guys I will be cynical enough to say that it strikes me as wholly plausible that the story which they invited was the first launch of the cable show that they want to host where they go after each other about six years from now I know about marriage and politics so he's not in support of John's very cynical theory is that she goes on this little tirade about George and then says oh it was off the record right knowing that that was not going to be off the record and the reporter says no we didn't establish that he's an experienced press person so I mean you know clearly they had all of this where they wanted to do this hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
