my administration wants to work with members of both parties to promote clean air and clean water who doesn't want clean air or clean water I'd like to think every American does that of course was President Trump about a year and a half ago vowing to promote clean air and water but actions taken over and over by the Environmental Protection Agency may do just the opposite the rolling back of vehicle emission standards for one and now Trump critics though critics of the EPA are worried that a new rule on it's bestest could be more exposure and not less to the cancer-causing material former governor christine Todd Whitman back with me to discuss and she of course is also the former head of the EPA walk us through this because deregulation has been a central focus of this administration and in some cases it makes sense some regulations don't work or there's redundancy but in this one getting back in the asbestos game why would we want such a thing no you shouldn't and the good the only good news about the Scott Pruett tenancy bus was that he was more bluster and he'd say things and say he's gonna rollback things to make headlines but he didn't understand how complicated legally it was and he didn't go through the right procedures so a lot of those are being thrown out by the courts Andrew wheeler knows how the process works I think he's a much more stable human being and I think he's working more with with the agency than before so American people are saying bring on bring that asbestos back to the party why are they rolling back on anything I mean we know between two and three hundred thousand Americans each year died from dirty airborne related causes and we know that tailpipe emissions are the major cause of that and yet we're rolling back the tailpipe emission standards we're doing things that make no sense except for individual industries that's where they're being done because they go to the bottom line of some industries even though the majority frankly of the big companies want to do things right and they are moving forward but you've got outliers and they're the ones that are taking advantage of and they seem to have the presidents here well president does like the chemical industry he's very close with Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical Liveris is one who put together those CEO councils for him he was with President Trump on the campaign trail but today the courts have a lot of power here and we've actually seen a federal court order the EPA to ban a common pesticide that's used in fruits and vegetables a pesticide that has been linked to child development issues how did this happen who wanted this well this was again it's just it's just a sort of mindless approach to we're gonna roll back every regulation I agree with you we ought to look at regulations would from time to time they ought to be revisited because things move on we find different way of doing things we find out things were worse or not as bad as we thought that's fine but this seems to be anything that Obama did we're gonna undo without thinking about does this make sense for the American people EPA is all about protecting human health and the environment that's it do you still consider yourself a Republican I'm an Eisenhower Republican and I believe firmly that the only way to change things is from within and we still need two parties a third party has never worked terribly well in this country but it's getting harder and harder to identify I'm certainly not one of these kinds of Republican all right well there's a very well-known Democrat Al Gore who said this he president Trump has had less of an impact so far than I fear he would someone said last year his administration is a blend of malevolence as I've lost my page malevolence and incompetence I think they've made some mistakes in some of the moves they made the courts have blocked some of what they wanted to do as a result do you agree with that I mean I feel like you were alluding to it with Scott Pruett they make a lot of noise but as far as what they actually get done that would harm the environment if you don't do it right then you're going to get reversed in the courts because the enabling legislation that set up the Environmental Protection Agency is very precise on what the agency has to consider and when and all the restrictions around that so if you don't you can't just get up one day and say asbestos is good for you now you have to say this is why we think the standard current standard for asbestos is wrong and this is the back up study that has been done that tells us that we can put it at a different place you can't be more than a sad America hey we produced quite a bit of asbestos over here in Russia then of all that's going on right now what has you most worried what's it's doing to undermining our fundamentals of government in this country our respect for the institutions of government are our confidence in the courts and the Independence of the judiciary and law enforcement the damage that's being done to young people and in saying that that you can denigrate people and judge people by the way they look by how they worship by the color of their skin why is this happening people voted for this well because people were so frustrated by what they saw as a complete lack of action by Congress they were scared they were worried that they weren't going to be able to provide the kind of future for their children that they had and they wanted to see some action I think the Bernie Sanders and the Donald Trump voters were two sides of the same coin they were those same people who were working hard staying in the same place not seeing a path to forward and you know we've had the best quarter the last quarter was the best quarter we've had in 2014 which was only four years ago under the much hated Obama by the way but anyway that's good but it's only one quarter and there's more to it than that it's more than just the economics about the very fundamentals of our government and what makes the United States the United States of America that people look up to around the income inequality divide fueled many of those voters what astounds me is that divide has only worsened but you'll get up and say you know more more blacks and minorities in general are working than ever before hey there I'm Chris
