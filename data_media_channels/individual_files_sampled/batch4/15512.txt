when was the last time you cried sir one Saturday wasn't for the boys because we're asking people about Justin Trudeau he's making a lot of public apologies lately it's just that our Prime Minister every time he makes an apology he seems to break down crying is that is that a heartwarming many several times you think is a cover-up as Justin Trudeau continues his 2017 cross Canada apology tour it seems that in addition to saying sorry a lot the PM tends to be crying a lot too whether it's apologizing to natives or members of the gay community or mourning the passing of a rockstar Justin's eyeballs resembles a water fountain these days but it's the site of a grown man crying in public heartwarming or embarrassing well let's see what members of generation Trudeau after-dark have to say about this one what do you think about Justin Trudeau crying every time he makes an apology passionate for his country Canada it shows his deep love and how much he cares about what's happening here in Canada you don't think it's a sign of weakness and being a man being a leader crying in public no I honestly think being a man like being a man and a leader is so like basic here I've never seen any of that before would you want your leader your prime minister to cry or embarrassing it's not really heartwarming Justin Trudeau he's a real one you know my guy he's Fugazi whose food whose he's a Fugazi but he's a real ones no just a heartwarming thing or is this embarrassing Justin Trudeau it is yeah man no less the leader of the country correct man in just any man form is just someone who holds up in a time of crisis and at time of distress so the fact that the Prime Minister of Canada is breaking down is amazing you know we found it seems that all the guys are cringing about this but most of the woman find it heartwarming so is this maybe a a gender thing here that you know I guess it speaks to modern dating in all honesty described himself as a feminist Justin Trudeau right which is fantastic and I think is great for this day and age and what's going on he would have electoral reform and electoral firm did not happen it's the second one tonight I feel like it's very like sinister in the sense that like Justin Trudeau is kind of hiding things you know he's not very like genuine about what he's saying oh so do you think these are crocodile tears that he's faking exactly I'm saying he was a drama teacher so him crying in public is actually part of his you know his demeanor so maybe it's an act it's crocodile tears Justin Trudeau was a drama teacher so that's who that's what we expect right where'd you come from sir I'm from Afghanistan from where sir an Estonian Oh Afghanistan it's the first time I came into your Canada I like Justin Trudeau he's the best in the world I like it that's it any of the leaders cry in Afghanistan fighting could you imagine like Donald Trump crying in public for example no because he's a prick sorry but I mean like any man who says I'm sorry grab her by the p-word like I think that no man like that should be a leader of a country as large and as great as the United's of America how about yourself ma'am is crying in public by the leader a good thing or is it embarrassing this is too too controversial question to get into could you imagine like a Donald Trump crying in public for example yeah but Donald Trump's an idiot hey folks the rebel has an all-new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out
