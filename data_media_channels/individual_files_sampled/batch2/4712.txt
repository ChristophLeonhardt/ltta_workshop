and here is breaking news for Montana here is the President of the United States tonight doing something you have never seen a president of the United States do defending his mental health one afternoon Donald Trump he lost it up here you know it's pretty tough I stand up here giving speeches for an hour and a half many times without notes and then they say he's lost it and yet we have 25,000 people showing up the speeches the president who denies he's lost it is also reportedly volcanic in his anger tonight he is becoming increasingly paranoid also if that is possible and this is not just because of the anonymously sourced New York Times op-ed or the release of quotes from Bob Woodward's new book that portray the president has unfit to serve and as having lost it according to Axios for some time last year Trump even carried with him a handwritten list of people suspected to be leakers undermining his agenda he would basically be like we've got to get rid of them the snakes are everywhere but we're getting rid of them set a source close to Trump mental health professionals have sounded the alarm about Donald Trump's instability and paranoia Brandon Lee the Yale University psychiatrist who edited a book about Donald Trump's mental state last year told salon two White House officials actually contacted me in late October stating that Trump was scaring them that he was unraveling while the President conducts his own hunt for the author of the New York Times op-ed one White House official told POLITICO if the goal was to moderate Trump's behavior it will do the opposite here is former CIA director John Brennan on Donald Trump's state of mind I think you see just a continual sort of increase in the concern the extraordinary measures that people are taking I do think things will get worse before they get better I don't know how Donald Trump is going to react to this a wounded lion is a very dangerous animal and I think Donald Trump is wounded generator discussion now David from a senior editor for The Atlantic and the author of Trump aa cracy the corruption of the American Republic and O'Brien is back with us and so David Frum there's the President of the United States he goes up to try to help a Montana Senate candidate spends his time talking about the New York Times and his own mental health right it's a weird rally a weirder than when even then the usual rallies in in the rally he had kind words for Greg G and Forte the congressman who bodyslam Ben Jacobs then with the Guardian and Trump praised or seemed to praise the use of violence against a journalist he also raised the specter of his own impeachment something presidents normally do not talk about and warned that it if the Democrats do well that his impeachment will be will be something that might become a reality and that's again something presidents don't like to concede because it leads to the thought well they must have something if they're thinking of impeaching you he does seem to be under more and more strain you know when the president praised himself for speaking endlessly without notes presidents other presidents even great Bill Clinton had notes Barack Obama enormous ly eloquent man he had notes the reason you have the notes is not because you can't talk it's because you you value your words so much and the very fact that Donald Trump is speaking without notes is a sign of trouble and we've all seen both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama speak without notes as president and as candidates and they could do it perfectly coherently let's go to the point that David just mentioned and that is the President of the United States talking about impeachment he actually says impeach Trump that's a little clip of this that will live forever but the reason most presidents have never discussed impeachment is because no one has ever discussed impeachment about most presidents so it wasn't just the president not talking about it no one in the country talked about it for most presidents but here's Donald Trump flew out to Montana tonight to try to help the Senate candidate talks about the New York Times talks about his own mental health and talks about his impeachment I don't even bring it up because I view it as something that you know what they like to use the impeach word impeach Trump Maxine Waters we will impeach him but he didn't do it doesn't matter we will impeach him then what you're going to have is you have a country that's going to turn in to a third-world country because if the opposite party becomes president every time before or not he or she is going to do a great job they'll say we want to impeach him then you'll a bitch if it's so ridiculous Tim O'Brien so he begins with I don't even bring it up right he brings up impeachment by beginning with the phrase I don't even bring it up right and and the president who's who's governing the country as if he was a third world dictator he said that if the opposite party gets into power we will devolve into a third world country one of trumps many poker tells is he will get in front of a crowd and talk about things that he's deeply insecure about but say he's not insecure you could do a mash-up of him getting on a stage and saying you know I'm a really smart guy I went to Wharton okay you know I'm a really rich guy I'm worth 10 billion dollars okay I'm a very attractive guy women love me okay because he's insecure about his appeal his wealth and his intellect and now we can add to that list a president who said I'm really not going to talk about impeachment but guess what everyone else was talking about impeachment well I'm not going to talk about mental health but tonight I'm going to address that because he realizes these things are in the air and they're being taken seriously and he's ingested that it's now part of what he's worried about and the real danger of a cornered Donald Trump was either cornered reputational e or legally as he will begin lashing out and David from what the president doesn't seem to understand is that the issue of leaking and the issue of loyalty and the issue of fidelity to the purpose of the presidency is something that is decided at the hiring stage and this is the person who always talked about the best people I get the best people I will get the best people these are the people who he got these are the people who he wanted these are the people who when they have a huddle with him tonight in the Oval Office about their suspect list of 12 at least one of them immediately lease the discussion in that huddle to the Washington Post look normally when leaks happen they happen in administration's where there are very intense conflicts and the leakers are fighting a battle in front of the President epically the Reagan administration was like this there are very very strong differences of opinion on many choose foreign and domestic and the combatants would baton and the president was very much a hands-off manager and so the newspapers would fill up with attacks by one senior staffer on another senior staffer not on the president what most presidents are good at you get to be president by being a team builder I mean it's a gigantic organization to build a presidential campaign you have to win votes from lots millions of people and you're usually pretty good winning the loyalties of dozens of people and so george w bush he had this ability in a small group to make people care about him and and and make his success their success I think Barack Obama did the same thing there's some but the Clinton administration was bumpier than that the Reagan administration was bumpier but even in the more bumpy administration's and certainly in the less the president gains oil T not just by the way he hires and not by punishing people but by inspiring people and that is clearly the thing that Donald Trump is unable to do even among his closest intimates even within the people nearest to him in his room and as anyone who's worked for an elected official can tell you there is nothing that binds the loyalty more strongly than admiration for the elected official that those people are working for and that apparently is what does not exist in the Trump administration David front Tim O'Brien thank you both for joining us tonight thanks for checking out our youtube channel
