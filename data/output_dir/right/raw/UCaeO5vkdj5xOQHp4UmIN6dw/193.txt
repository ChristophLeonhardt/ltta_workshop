1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
- This is why the left is
shocked when they lose elections.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,160
They're shocked, they
turn hysterical when they

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,160
lose elections 'cause
they were supposed to win.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,230
Don't you know, didn't you get the memo?

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,130
In 2000, Al Gore was supposed to win.

6
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,810
He was supposed to be the President.

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,970
In 2016, don't get me started on 2016.

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,600
Oh, in 2016, she was supposed to win.

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,170
All the political scientists
told us she was going to win.

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,003
What's the matter?

11
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:25,370
And so when she didn't
win, and she didn't win,

12
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,506
and when she didn't win, that
deserves a round of applause.

13
00:00:29,506 --> 00:00:32,673
(audience applauding)

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,112
So when Hillary didn't win,

15
00:00:39,112 --> 00:00:43,362
(audience applauding and cheering)

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,950
You and I, we could be
here all night doing that.

17
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:52,541
All right, do it again.

18
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,541
(crowd cheering and applauding)

19
00:00:58,263 --> 00:01:02,346
So when Hillary didn't
win, she, all right, stop.

20
00:01:04,153 --> 00:01:05,725
(laughter)

21
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,310
When she didn't win, she lost it.

22
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,143
She lost it.

23
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:10,970
It couldn't possibly be,
because she didn't win.

24
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,803
It couldn't be.

25
00:01:11,803 --> 00:01:13,140
Do you know who's fault it was?

26
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,260
It was the Macedonians.

27
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,130
It was the Russians.

28
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,410
It was Comey, it was that, it was Tr.

29
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,098
Really, Donald Trump was
the guy who beat her.

30
00:01:20,098 --> 00:01:24,680
The only answer that
she could not land on,

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,750
the only one that the
ideological Democrats

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,680
could not accept was
that the American people,

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,600
those deplorable
irredeemable American people

34
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,840
did not vote for her.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:00:00,000
That she lost fair and square.
