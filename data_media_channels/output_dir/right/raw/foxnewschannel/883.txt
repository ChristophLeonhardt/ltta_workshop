5
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,970
IT'S BEEN ONLY A LITTLE OVER 24

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:19,044
HOURS SINCE THE MAJOR DOJ

7
00:00:19,044 --> 00:00:20,779
INSPECTOR GENERAL WAS RELEASE.

8
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,415
WHAT IS THE PRESS MISSING.

9
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:32,891

00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:33,358
JOURNAL BOARD.

11
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:35,260
WHAT JUMPED OUT WHEN YOU READ

12
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:35,560
THIS?

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,195
>> MOST OF THE HEADLINES TODAY

14
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:39,030
HAVE BEEN FOCUSSED ON JIM COMEY.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,299
NO QUESTION THAT THIS WAS A VERY

16
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:43,168
DAMNING INDICTMENT OF HIS

17
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,437
LEADERSHIP WHILE HE WAS THERE.

18
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,873
THEN, AGAIN, DEMOCRATS AND A LOT

19
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:49,407
IN THE MEDIA WOULD LIKE TO PIN

20
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:50,776

21
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:53,979

23
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:57,682
FBI AND ITS CULTURE.

24
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,119
THE ARGUMENT THEY LIVE BY A RULE

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:02,454
THEY THEMSELVES CRAFT AND IMPOSE

26
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:03,555
RULES ON EVERYBODY ELSE, BUT

27
00:01:03,555 --> 00:01:04,790
THEY DON'T LIVE BY THEM.

28
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:09,060
WE HAVE EXAMPLES IN HERE OF

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,529

COMPUTERS AND CELLPHONES FOR

31
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,397

32
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:14,599
WE FOUND OUT THAT COMEY'S ENTIRE

33
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:18,570
STAFF WAS COMPLICIT IN HELPING

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,910

WE HAVE UNAUTHORIZED CONTACTS

38
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:33,385
WITH THE PRESS.

39
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:40,592
AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

40
00:01:40,592 --> 00:01:43,028
TIPPING OFF THE HILLARY CLINTON

41
00:01:43,028 --> 00:01:43,662
TEAM.

42
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:46,464

QUESTIONED HIM.

46
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,139
THIS IS A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM.

47
00:01:54,139 --> 00:01:56,374
AT LEAST IN THE LEADER SHOULD BE

48
00:01:56,374 --> 00:00:00,000
ACROSS THE FBI.
