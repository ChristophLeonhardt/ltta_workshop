it's one of the poorest countries in the world facing some of the biggest challenges but Sorelli owns about to get in you're president so how will he tackle everything from the Ebola crisis of the economy this is inside story I'm Hoshi mahabhava hello and welcome to the program the votes are being counted in Sierra Leone in a poll delayed by electoral fraud allegations a presidential runoff between two men to succeed President Ernest Bai Koroma who's stepping down after 10 years the task for whoever wins the nation's recovery from years of struggle Sierra Leone already had one of the world's highest infant mortality rates then came an outbreak of the Ebola disease the health system couldn't cope on top of that a slump in commodity prices cripple the economy we'll talk to our guests in a moment but first a ministries reports from Freetown as election officers count the votes Sara Leoneans hold their breath this is the last leg for difficult three months officials are hoping that the turnout will be high to give legitimacy to the process when President Ernest Bai Koroma arrived to choose his successor there was hardly anyone queuing to vote those who did left long before the low turnout was not lost on the president my only concern at the runoff is the voter turnout that seemed to be a bit lower than what we experienced on the seventh with all the gains we have made it is incumbent on the candidates to accept the outcome of the elections this is what some say is partly responsible for some voters staying away especially in more rural areas heavily armed soldiers at polling stations we have high presence of security outfits there has been a number of issues in mutation treads and all of that and citizens and I mean they are not so enthusiastic in terms of how the process is going the real camera lives close to why the president voted but he's not keen on voting age even a youth anymore no but anything lansky yeah and there are thousands who think that way the race has narrowed to two candidates after the first round failed to produce a clear winner voters must choose between a former military ruler and a former government minister they both represent parties that have dominated politics in Sierra Leone voters who turned up are mostly young and are eager to change the way things are done here for those who chose to participate like this first-time voter they simply want their voices heard we need an improvement election officials say results could be out in a few days but we ever succeeds this man will have to find a way to unite settle unions polarized by the election as well as addressing the critical needs of the people I met Idris al Jazeera Freetown let's bring in our panel from Freetown Cornelius DeVoe really owns deputy minister of information in Birmingham in the UK Laura Martin lecturer at the University of Birmingham and joining us via Skype from Yaounde Cameroon marriageable OA editor at Africa International welcome to you all I would like to start by asking mr. devote this the first round was a tight raised race is the second round and the final one likely to be a replay of this or the first scenario well suddenly this occurrence is going to be also a tight race because we see through the two presidential candidates they have their various advantages whatever considering the total number of registered voters Parisienne it is very much likely that dr. Samoa Matthew Wilson Kamala who is the candidate of the old People's Congress will emerge successful Laura is this your feeling that Zamora Kamara is likely to win the election or his opponent Julius Madhavi oh I think that Julius Mata Bao has a very good chance of winning I think it really will depend on this voter turnout as you were discussing earlier I think it will depend on where the voters turned out but I think Julius Mata Bo has a very good chance of winning mm-hmm marine I mean it's an election which is sort of marked by voter turnout which is low compared to previous elections is something which is going to have an impact on the future of the democratic process in Sierra Leone this is a very special election because it's not been easy there it was discussion and I would say contestation didn't be as you know and what we see is very difficult to say for my point whist very difficult Apple changes that the background is that you feel that what they call the international community is sort of especially the the business world is sort of supporting the outcoming the outgoing regime so because they feel they have they have sort of real an economy after war and that the prospects are very hopeful so whatever you've been reading and hearing around and even elegantly in the eco community the most person positive with they'd be the candidate from the rooting patch so let's talk about the two main candidates let's start with Kamara mr. Deveaux why would the people of Sierra Leone pick Kamara as the next president of the country well dr. Samuel Matthew Wilson Kamara is not in any way connected with the ugly history of this country which brought about an 11 year old liberal walk and also he is a statesman who has served several governments but throughout his tenure he has never been unpicked or accused of having it being involved in any corruption apart from that he has international recognition that could not be the case by the way because he has been accused also of he's been accused of corruption and he's been widely described by his opponent as mister 10% well these are allegations for political points nobody has ever brought up any tangible in emanating evidence to justify their acquisition of dr. Samuel Aqaba has been co-opted or as DC mister 10% because if you want to see his quote then you provide the evidence in the absence of any evidence to substantiate the claims of him being mr. 10% seller unions have suddenly come to the conclusion that doctors are Muhammad Wilson Kamara is as clean as a white handkerchief and is not those that claim is experienced he has passion for young people he has passion for the older people is committed is dedicated and is the most suitable of the two on which our unions will I see appoint and over the destiny of this country to Fahrenheit box Laura we're talking about Zamora Kamara who has been a trained economist who presents himself as the candidate of the continuity of the political establishment and that he would like to move ahead his credentials likely to push voters to decide who is likely to become the next president of the country quite possibly I mean people do look at his experience he has been in government for for 20 years and and he actually has worked for the opposing party as well at certain points his credentials certainly do you mean something he is very well known in Sierra Leone for being a technocrat and having a lot of experience but his association with the APC shouldn't go unnoticed either he has an ax he has a very clear association and and hat was many would say handpicked by the current president and so and to be honest my from my experience over the last couple of weeks I was in Sierra Leone and people are a lot of people are very disillusioned with the way that the government has gone the last 10 years so I I don't know I'm not entirely confident that his credentials will necessarily be enough because at the end of the day he's still associated with the APC Marie this is someone who has been widely described as a candidate who stays away from taking a tough stance when it comes to major challenges the country faces is there something which is going to help help him or undermine his chances to become a president you know I wonder with the cerulean it's really onions the the fear to get back into the past with the opposition candidate being linked to two coos being involved in two pooch and he has also lost before the previous attempt against Bai Koroma he lost elections so it's like maybe people won't expect so much they won't expect miracles but maybe they are they prefer to have sort of the devil with Lobeck which is ruling party rather than maybe attempting again to to go the certain certain path which is more problematic it's something you wonder and that's what is at stake here because I don't think that mr. chimera is will we be a providential man I don't think so there's memory otherwise all by now I think he he has some challenges on his own but we feel that the people in Sierra Leone maybe you would like to build on on something which have started sort of recovery after war horses and and not change back right now that's mr. Deveaux running against chimera is the bravado army officer former co-leader Julius mother bo a remarkable political career widely seen by many as the white man to leave the country for the future what do you think well he's certainly the right man and that was noticed by the members of the old People's Congress party the party to which he belongs and that was why at the party's national delegates conference after going to several consultation involving senior stakeholders of the party it was resolved at the party's national delegates conference that out of 28 people who had aspired to be the presidential candidate dr. samaram Audrey Wilson Kamara was the most suitable and these leads to West the claim that he was impeached by dr. Anna's by kuma the current president who is also the national chairman and leader of our party President Koroma had to follow the dictates of the 1995 fifth December APC Constitution and it was on the provisions of that Constitution that dr. Samuel Kamara was appointed to be the presidential candidate and we in the APC we believe has the capacity we believe is fully charged we believe his experience surpasses that of mr. Julia's mother view we believe he has a very clean record we believe his aunts are not soiled with the blood of people who we are yes his answer not soiled with the blood the credentials we're talking about the track record of mr. camara didn't help him at all in the first round no of course they did don't forget that the first round was mad by several irregularities and these illegality is you know we are brought to the light by other opposition parties including the main SLPP and even my party together with civil society organizations and even ordinary citizens who used social media to bring out malpractices that we are being or not in our respective communities okay so the first round result is something that we should not take for granted especially when you consider that the results we are aggregated and released by the electoral commission on a 25 percent basis of total cooling stations instead of total number of votes cast I say the respective candidates in each polling station okay Laura I would like to move now to Laura Matt W looks like a real political phenomena in Sierra Leone how do you explain his growing appeal among the people who see him as the white choice for the country well I think it's not just about Mata Bo I think I think it's also about what the SLP P stands for I think that you know the SLP P has has done a big campaign towards free education they're very big on cleaning up corruption they're they've they've they have plans to to help the economy get back on its feet I mean I I think it's not just about him as an individual I think it's about it's also about the memory of kaabah who was the president from from 96 to 2007 and people have this memory of a better life at back then and what life was like when free education was available and their kids were not struggling to go to school and so you know I think I think he is symbolic of this he is a sort of lifelong politician he has been around he certainly doesn't have an entirely clean record by any by any stretch but but I think people are just looking for something new I think they're looking for a change mm-hmm Murray this is someone who has been involved in the 1992 military coup where his troops killed 20 people he apologized apologized for that he was also involved in 1996 coup has his image been rehabilitated among the Sierra Leoneans do they forget about the past well I don't think they forget at all but you know politics in Africa is very much based and undetermined by along the ethnic lines and this is not absent from this election the the ethnic parameter is also there but and what we see that if he people had really forgotten that his appeal would be stronger because incumbent president have always had time and what we see here is very difficult to to to decide you know they had almost the same amount of votes in in the first round almost the same era and that was spectacular but if if I may give one of the opinion well what I consider a very sort of a leading opinion in in so many course countries is that they don't like leaders who've been involved in Coos it's been not only once inclusive but twice that's true to that two times in the coup and also because now people are really desperately trying to to turn the page of that area and I'm pretty engaged into democracy and the second point is that resident biker Roma had engaged in a very constructive cooperation with his colleagues from the ECOWAS and this is an asset while Africa tries to build communities and free trade areas and and you know and achieve development through unity and they saw a mistress okay towards former purchased alright so now let's move forward to what happens next I mean let's talk about the challenges that the next president of Silurian will have to deal with mr. Deveaux what do you think is the top priority for the next president is it going to be rebuilding the health care system that has been destroyed during the Ebola crisis or do you think economy is the number one priority mr. Duvall well we have our manifesto which is governing for the grassroots and in that manifesto we intend to expand healthcare services to improve and expand healthcare services across the country we intend to expand the free health care scheme which for now includes persons with disabilities survivors of survivors of Ebola and also children under five years together with pregnant remain and lactating moderns we have recently introduced the Sierra Leone health insurance scheme which caters for every family member of every worker in this country we are also going to pursue very vigorously our efforts in diversifying the economy we realized that reliant on a particular commodity could cause a serious setback to the economy having experienced the fall in commodity prices and the way it's affected our economy we are pushing towards diversification we are expanding agricultural projects to ensure that we are able not just to grow what it that's easy sell food and implement the cultural sector I see let me just include Laura Laura we need law yeah yeah I would just like to include Laura in in this discussion the next president will come against the backdrop of a country that has been destroyed by the Ebola epidemic growing rates of HIV malaria destroyed health care system shortage of health professionals a how can he put the country back on track when the revenues have been in decline over the last few years well that's a very good question but I mean I do think the economy is is key to this and I think I think you can't really have an improved healthcare system without an improved economy you know people I spoke to in the last couple of weeks one of the key things that they pointed to when they were discussing who they were going to vote for was rising food prices and and how much the cost of living has gone up rent school fees all these sorts of things and so I think these are at the forefront of the of the things that people are worried about and and did ultimately influence their vote so I think promises of a better economy and and how you how you do that is going to be absolutely critical for the next president Murray this is going to be my last question please in less than one minute this is the fifth post-war election in Syria and many say just on its own is a sign that democracy is on track in the country a good sign yes definitely oh definitely I mean we have been following Sierra Leone and being mentioned some time as an example of the process which is underway through all those difficulties are huge we spoke about Ebola we speak about all the challenges with himself and with you you had already two x elections changing presidents and the first one who's very well the second one had a little bit of problems but basically the process is doing well and we if we compare with many other countries around on that particular issue we're sharing what Leon is doing pretty well I suppose it's a good basis we launched to get back unfortunately we're running out of time thank you thank you very much you did for your in size Cornelius Devorah Martin and Murray voucher bill WA and thank you too for watching you can see their program again any time by visiting our website aljazeera.com for further discussion go to our Facebook page that's facebook.com forward slash AJ inside story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from me hashem albert on the whole team here bye for now you you you
