so we've got drama between John McCain and Donald Trump again this time McCain with a clear shot against Trump which I have to confess that I loved before we get to that let me give you the context you remember of course when Donald Trump was running for president he had said about John McCain quote he's not a war hero he was a war hero because he was captured I like people who weren't captured now of course he said that with the convenience of having avoided the Vietnam draft and in fact that's what John McCain's him talk about in a second but I did want to you be a little bit more context to about John McCain's service if you didn't know in 1967 McCain was shot down over northern Vietnam during a bombing raid breaking both his arms and right leg while ejecting from his plane he spent the next five years in the notorious Hanoi Hilton prison camp where he was repeatedly tortured and spent two years in solitary confinement the scars remain with McCain today he's unable to raise either of his arms above his shoulders Trump has reportedly never apologized to McCain for the remarks now that doesn't mean that John McCain is immune from criticism far for Matt and I have criticized them off and on his hawkish stance and when it comes to foreign policy everybody is allowed to disagree but saying that he's not a war hero because he was captured from a guy who ran from the Vietnam War that's a little bit too much for everyone that's by very not a little it's way way too much apparently including for John McCain who had this to say recently was a tumultuous time and most of it was bred by the conflict and one aspect of the conflict by the way that I will never ever countenance is that we drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur that is wrong that is wrong if we're gonna ask every American to serve every American should serve Oh shots fired and not so friendly fire the person who claimed our bone spurs and was very rich at the time and his daddy got him out of the war Donald Trump let me use the background on that later became try to walk her back a little bit like why I didn't say don't trip no you didn't bone spurs bone spurs so here's the history of Trump on this issue when Trump was in college as salon explains from 1964 to 1968 he received four draft deferments for education but in 1968 during the height of the Vietnam War Trump received a 1y Medical deferment for bone spurs on the heels of his feet so the reference to bone spurs could couldn't be any clearer there's no other person known to have bone spurs and gotten out of the war because of that the rush limbaugh had got out of the war he said he had a tail I'm not kidding some sort of discharge built up near his anus and that's why he couldn't go to Vietnam not kidding look it up all the right almost all the right wing are filled with cowards who love to push your kids in the war but didn't go themselves Ted Nugent literally crapped himself to get out of the war looked that up that's amazing Trent Lott sorry it's time to lay back in the day hot tub Tom DeLay said that the minorities took his spots otherwise he would have gone Dick Cheney said he had better things to do later he would have better things to do like starting wars that your kids have to die for so all those guys didn't go now if that wasn't bad enough about Trump absolutely running from Vietnam and then saying he doesn't like people who were captured during that war he chose not to go to then you have this bit of context the president later told the New York Times that it was a minor malady and that he could not remember which foot had been injured in other words yeah of course we made it up we were rich my daddy got me a doctor's knows about it some bone spurs I clearly didn't have believe it or not back then he was actually an athlete I know it seems a little weird these days but yes he was there's a minor malady in other words it didn't exist and he doesn't remember which foot it was in because it wasn't an either okay now just to be absolutely over the top on this Donald Trump later joked on the Howard Stern Show that he did have his own personal beam on what was it well it was on the issue sexually transmitted diseases quote from Donald Trump I've been so lucky in terms of that whole world meaning the sexually transmitted diseases it is a dangerous world out there it's scary like Vietnam sort of like the Vietnam er it's my personal Vietnam I feel like you're great and very brave soldiers because back then he was going to so many orgies while other people were dying because they weren't as rich as him and has corrupt as him that he felt like wow you know I dodged a couple bullets there in the different orgies that I went to and I didn't get any STDs and I'm a brave and great soldier but John McCain isn't driving that shot that me came to get him is the very least he could do it's about time and I hope he does a hell of a lot more than that because Donald Trump has richly deserved it if you like this video you probably like independent media the best way
