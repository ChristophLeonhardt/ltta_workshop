there was a time when i was alone
nowhere to go and no place to call home
my only friends was the man in the moon
and even sometimes he would go away, too
then one night, as i closed my eyes
i saw a shadow flying high
he came to me with the sweetest smile
told me he wanted to talk for awhile
he said, "Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely" and
ever since that day
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with peter pan
and when we're bored we play in the woods
always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run, lost boy" they say to me
away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
and lost boys like me are free
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
and always i will say
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run, lost boy, " they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last
Peter Pan, Tinkerbell, Wendy Darling
Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect story book
Neverland, I love you so
You are now my home sweet home
Forever a lost boy at last
and ever since that day
I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
"Run, run, lost boy, " they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
