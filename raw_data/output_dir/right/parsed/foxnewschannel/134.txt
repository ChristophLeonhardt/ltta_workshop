THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
REPUBLICANS ARE LOOKING TO
KEEP THEIR MAJORITIES DESPITE
THE POLLS SHOWING THEM UNDER
WATER WITH THE FEMALE LIKELY
VOTERS.
HEADLINES LIKE THIS FROM THE
"ASSOCIATED PRESS" AIMED AT
THE PRESIDENT.
"HORSEFACE."
DOES IT MATTER WHAT TRUMP
RIDICULES WOMEN?
LAURA TRUMP IS CAMPAIGNING FOR
TRUMP AND THERE ARE A LOT OF
OTHER RACES.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME
TO VISIT WITH US.
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.
THE PRESIDENT GOT A LOT OF
ATTENTION FOR THE BACK AND
FORTH FOR STORMY DANIELS THIS
WEEK.
THE "WASHINGTON POST" SAYS
DESPITE THE MULTIPLE POLLS
SHOWS THAT THE G.O.P. IS DOING
POORLY WITH THE WOMEN OVERALL
AND THE PARTY IS LOSING SOME
OF THE FEMALE VOTERS WHO
SUPPORTED TRUMP IN 2016, THE
PRESIDENT CONTINUED TO SAY
THINGS THAT MANY PREDICT WILL
KEEP THE WOMEN VOTING FOR
REPUBLICANS IN THE NOVEMBER
MIDTERM ELECTION.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT
CONCERN?
>> I WAS IN NORTH CAROLINA
YESTERDAY.
AND THE NUMBER OF WOMEN THAT
TURNED OUT AT ALL THE PLACES
THAT I WENT, ALL THE EVENTS
SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT,
SUPPORTING THE MIDTERM
CANDIDATES, IT WAS -- I MEAN
PRETTY AMAZING.
IT IS SAD THAT THE MEDIA
FOCUSES ON THIS SORT OF THING
INSTEAD OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT
HAS DONE.
INSTEAD OF THE REASON THAT
PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN
IN 2020.
I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL VOTE
FOR HIM IN 2020 THAN EVEN DID
IN 2016.
WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY WANT TO
KNOW THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN
THE RIGHT DIRECTION.
THEY WANT TO KNOW THEIR
CHILDREN ARE BEING TAKEN CARE
OF, THAT THE FUTURE IS GOOD
FOR THEM, THAT THE COUNTRY IS
SAFER.
AND UNDER TRUMP, THEY CAN SAY
ALL THE THINGS ARE TRUE.
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING.
MANY TIMES PEOPLE HAVE MONEY
NOW TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO
COLLEGE POSSIBLY, THEY DIDN'T
BEFORE.
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WOMEN
CARE ABOUT MORE THAN TWEETS
FROM THE PRESIDENT.
>> Shannon: WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF THE POLLS THAT SHOW
18-POINT DEFICIT AMONG THE
GENDER GAP FOR THE REPUBLICANS
WITH WOMEN?
DO YOU THINK THE MESSAGE IS
NOT GETTING THROUGH OR IS IT
OVERSHADOWED IN THE TWEETS AND
THE BACK-AND-FORTH?
>> I HAVE NEVER BELIEVED
POLLS.
WE SAW POLLS IN 2016 WERE NOT
ACCURATE AT ALL.
I STILL THINK THAT IT CARRIES
OVER NOW A BIT.
I WILL TELL YOU AFTER WHAT I
CALL THE KAVANAUGH EFFECT,
HONESTLY AFTER THE KAVANAUGH
CONFIRMATION THE NUMBER OF
WOMEN THAT ARE MORE INSPIRED
ON THE REPUBLICAN END NOW TO
GET OUT AND VOTE IS REALLY
ASTONISHING.
I FOUND WOMEN COMING UP TO ME
TO TELL ME HOW FRUSTRATED THEY
WERE WITH THAT AND HOW MUCH IT
MAKES THEM WANT TO VOTE FOR
REPUBLICANS.
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE POLLS
ARE REFLECTING THE SENTIMENTS
OF THE WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY.
>> Shannon: POLLS ASIDE.
A WOMAN WHO WAS SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE AND HOPES TO BE AGAIN.
THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER
NANCY PELOSI.
>> IF THE ELECTION WERE TODAY
WE WOULD WIN THE MAJORITY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD BE
INVOLVED BUT WE WOULD WIN THE
MINORITY.
WAVE OR TSUNAMI, WE'LL SEE IN
THREE WEEKS.
>> Shannon: SHE SAID IT
WOULD BE A BLUE WAVE OR BLUE
TSUNAMI.
HOW RIGHT DO YOU THINK SHE IS?
>> I'M GOING TO HOPE SHE IS
REALLY WRONG AND I THINK THAT
WE ARE GOING TO ALL HAVE TO
WAIT AND SEE.
I WILL TELL YOU EVERYWHERE I
HAVE TRAVELED, THE NUMBER OF
THE WOMEN THAT ARE COMING OUT,
THAT ARE NOT JUST EXCITED TO
VOTE IN THE MIDTERMS BUT THAT
ARE VOLUNTEERING AND WORKING
THE POLLS -- MY MOM IS
ACTUALLY WORKING THE POLLS IN
NORTH CAROLINA.
IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.
I THINK THAT WOMEN ARE
EXCITED.
THE MEN ARE EQUALLY HAS
EXCITED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
I THINK THE REPUBLICANS AS A
WHOLE ARE GALVANIZE AND
UNIFIED.
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN
THE DEMOCRATS ARE ACTING SO
CRAZY PEOPLE IN THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY ARE COMING TOGETHER TO
SAY WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO
OVERTAKE OUR COUNTRY.
IF WE HAVE A SPEAKER NANCY
PELOSI, OR A SENATE MAJORITY
LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER, THAT
WILL SPELL DISASTER FOR THE
COUNTRY.
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA WILL
NOT GET ACCOMPLISHED.
EVERYTHING WE HAVE SEEN
POSITIVE HAPPEN IN THIS
COUNTRY UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP
WILL COME TO A SCREECHING
HALT.
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THEY WILL
TRY TO IMPEACH HIM.
AND ALL THE FORWARD PROGRESS
WILL STOP.
I THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT
IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO GET OUT
AND VOTE IN THE MIDTERMS.
>> Shannon: WHAT ABOUT THE
CONVERSATION ABOUT CIVILITY
NOW?
WE SEE THERE ARE SUGGESTIONS
TO GET IN PEOPLE'S FACES AND
FIND THEM IN PUBLIC.
WE SEE IT HAPPENING.
THEN PEOPLE AGITATE ON SOCIAL
MEDIA, MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT
THERE.
I DON'T KNOW IF IT HAPPENS TO
YOU.
IT'S PRETTY WIDESPREAD.
BUT THOSE THAT WILL SAY THE
PRESIDENT STARTED THIS BY
CARRIAGING NAME CALLING AND
EN -- BY ENCOURAGING NAME
CALLING AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE
TO GET ROUGH WITH PROTESTERS
AT THE RALLIES.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE
CONVERSATION?
>> THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
THE REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY
OF JOBS AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE
THE PARTY OF MOBS.
IT'S DISGUSTING THAT THERE IS
ANYONE CALLING FOR VIOLENCE OR
ANYTHING AS AGREESIVE AS WHAT
WE HAVE SEEN COME OUT OF SOME
DEMOCRAT LEADER'S MOUTH.
YOU ARE HEARD MAXINE WATERS
CALLING FOR THIS STUFF.
IT'S HAPPENED TO SO MANY
PEOPLE.
IT'S DISGUSTING.
THIS IS NOT AMERICA.
WE ARE ALL AMERICANS.
WE CAN DISAGREE AND WE CAN BE
CIVIL ABOUT IT.
ALL I WILL SAY IS THAT IF YOU
HAVE NOT SEEN THE NONSENSE
FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE.
