>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
NOW REPORTING GEORGE 
STEPHANOPOULOS.
>>> GOOD AFTERNOON, WE'RE COMING
ON THE AIR RIGHT NOW BECAUSE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS IN THE ROSE 
GARDEN WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
OF SPAIN MARIANO RAJOY, THE 
PRESIDENT OF THEIR GOVERNMENT.
JUST MOMENTS AGO, THE PRESIDENT 
EMPHASIZED THE DISASTER RESPONSE
IN PUERTO RICO WHICH IS NOW 
BEING DESCRIBED AS A 
HUMANITARIAN DISASTER.
ALSO DISCOVERING WITH KOREA, THE
TOUGH SANCTIONS HE SAYS THE 
UNITED NATIONS PASSED LAST WEEK.
ALSO THE TIGHTENING OF BANKING 
RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA AND 
CHINA.
THE PRESIDENT PRAISED THE 
CHINESE FOR THAT.
OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD
A WAR OF WORDS WITH KIM JONG-UN 
CALLING HIM THE ROCKET MAN.
AND TO MARTHA RADDATZ.
MARTHA, AS THE PRESIDENT HAS 
BEEN SPEAKING, THE PRESIDENT AND
JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF REMINDING 
EVERYONE HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.
>> HE SPECIFICALLY ASKED GENERAL
JOE DUNFORD, IF NORTH KOREA 
POSSESSED A NUCLEAR REACTIVE AND
CAPABLE ICBM SYSTEM.
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID, FOR ALL 
PURPOSES COMPARABILITY AND 
DEVELOPMENT, WE SHOULD ASSUME 
NOW THAT NORTH KOREA HAS THE 
CAPABILITY AND HAS THE WILL TO 
USE THAT CAPABILITY.
THAT'S HOW URGENT THIS PROBLEM 
IS.
AND IT IS A PROBLEM THAT DONALD 
TRUMP HAS TO DEAL WITH.
NO PRESIDENT BEFORE HIM HAS HAD 
THIS PROBLEM.
IT'S BASICALLY BEEN PUNTED DOWN 
THE ROAD TO DONALD TRUMP.
>> WE'VE SEEN THE ESCALATION 
AROUND NORTH KOREA SO FAR, 
MARTHA RADDATZ.
AND NORTH KOREA RESPONDING TO 
THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS BY TAKING 
THEM AS A DECLARATION OF WAR?
>> YES, THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER 
SAYS IT'S A DECLARATION OF WAR 
BY HAVING THOSE BOMBERS GO NORTH
OF THE DMZ.
IT WAS OFF THE COAST OF NORTH 
KOREA, ABOUT 100 MILES AWAY FROM
NORTH KOREA.
BUT WELL BEYOND THE BORDER WHERE
THEY USUALLY FLY.
HE SAID HE WILL SHOOT THEM DOWN,
EVEN IF THEY ARE, AS THEY WERE, 
IN INTERNATIONAL AIRSPACE.
EXPERTS DO NOT BELIEVE HE HAS 
THAT CAPABILITY RIGHT NOW, 
GEORGE.
>> NOT RIGHT NOW.
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS ALSO BEEN 
IN SOMEWHAT OF A WAR OF WORDS 
WITH THE NFL TAKING ON THE 
PLAYERS WHO DECIDED TO TAKE A 
KNEE.
IN PROTEST TO HIS COMMENTS ON 
FRIDAY.
THE PRESIDENT COULD GET ASKED 
ABOUT THAT AT THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE AS WELL.
AS WE SPEAK ON CAPITOL HILL, IT 
APPEARS THAT THE SENATE HAS MADE
A LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO REPEAL 
AND REPLACE OBAMACARE IS FINALLY
ON ITS LAST LEGS.
THREE SENATORS AGAINST IT.
SENATOR RAPIDS PAUL, SENATOR 
JOHN McCAIN, SENATOR SUSAN 
COLLINS OF MAINE.
REPUBLICANS ARE MEETING TO 
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE 
ACTUALLY GOING TO PUSH AHEAD FOR
A VOTE ON THIS.
ALL OF THIS COMING AS THE 
PRESIDENT LAYING THE GROUNDWORK 
FOR THE MAJOR TAX REFORM HE 
WANTS TO PASS.
THE PRESIDENT MEETING WITH A 
BIPARTISAN GROUP MEMBERS OF THE 
HOUSE FROM DEMOCRAT AND 
REPUBLICAN SIDE TODAY TALKING 
ABOUT TAX REFORM.
SO, A FULL PLATE FOR THE RED 
RIGHT NOW.
LET'S GO TO THE ROSE GARDEN.
>> WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE 
POLITICAL SITUATIONS OF BOTH OF 
OUR COUNTRIES, SPAIN AND UNITED 
STATES, TWO DEMOCRACIES, FRIENDS
AND ALLIES WITH MANY COMMON 
VALUES AND INTERESTS.
AND WE AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER 
IN AREA OF DEFENSE OF THOSE 
VALUES WITH A COMPREHENSIVE AND 
COOPERATIVE VISION.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE WARM 
WELCOME THAT WAS EXTENDED TOYS 
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS TEAM.
>> THE PRIME MINISTER OF SPAIN 
WRAPPING UP HIS STATEMENTS RIGHT
NOW.
MARIANO RAJOY.
>> WITH THE FRIENDSHIP THAT 
EXISTS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND SPAIN.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> STEVE HARLAND, PLEASE, 
REUTERS.
DON'T GET NERVOUS, STEVE.
BEING PREOCCUPIED WITH THE NFL 
WHY ISN'T THAT FAIR ASSESSMENT?
>> WELL, I WASN'T PREOCCUPIED BY
THE NFL.
IT WAS A SHAME.
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN DISRESPECT
OUR FLAG, OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.
TO ME, THE NFL IS A VERY 
IMPORTANT SITUATION.
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE ABOUT WAS
I PREOCCUPIED.
NOT AT ALL.
NOT AT ALL.
I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME ON MY 
HANDS.
ALL I DO IS WORK.
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, THAT'S AN
IMPORTANT FUNCTION OF WORKING.
IT'S CALLED RESPECT FOR OUR 
COUNTRY.
MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED.
MANY, MANY PEOPLE HORRIBLY 
INJURED I WAS AT WALTER REED 
HOSPITAL RECENTLY AND I SAW SO 
MANY GREAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND 
THEY'RE MISSING LEGS AND ARMS 
AND SO BADLY INJURED.
AND THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR OUR 
COUNTRY.
THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR OUR FLAG.
THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR OUR 
NATIONAL ANTHEM.
FOR PEOPLE TO DISRESPECT THAT BY
KNEELING DURING THE PLAYING OF 
OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM I THINK IS 
DISGRACEFUL.
SO, I WILL ALSO SAY THAT, AGAIN,
I READ YOU PART OF THIS QUOTE, 
BUT THE GOVERNOR OF PUERTO RICO 
IS SO THANKFUL FOR THE GREAT JOB
WE'RE DOING.
WE DID A GREAT JOB IN TEXAS.
A GREAT JOB IN FLORIDA.
A GREAT JOB IN LOUISIANA.
WE HIT LITTLE PIECES OF GEORGIA.
AND ALABAMA.
AND FRANKLY, WE'RE DOING -- AND 
IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT JOB 
BECAUSE IT'S ON THE ISLAND -- 
IT'S ON AN ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE OCEAN.
IT'S OUT IN THE OCEAN.
YOU CAN'T JUST DRIVE YOUR TRUCKS
THERE FROM OTHER STATES.
AND THE GOVERNOR SAID WE ARE 
DOING A GREAT JOB.
IN FACT, HE THANKED ME 
SPECIFICALLY FOR FEMA AND ALL OF
THE FIRST RESPONDERS IN PUERTO 
RICO.
AND WE'RE ALSO MENTIONING WITH 
THAT THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS.
IT WAS DEVASTATED.
SO, WE ARE TOTALLY FOCUSED ON 
THAT.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT DOESN'T
TAKE ME LONG TO PUT OUT A WRONG.
AND MAYBE WE'LL GET IT RIGHT.
I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT 
THING FOR THE NFL TO NOT ALLOW 
PEOPLE TO KNEEL DURING THE 
PLAYING OF OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.
TO RESPECT OUR COUNTRY AND TO 
RESPECT OUR FLAG.
OKAY?
THANK YOU.
>> IF I COULD ASK THE PRIME 
MINISTER A QUESTION.
IS IT GOING TO TAKE A WAR TO 
REIN IN NORTH KOREA?
AND WHAT IS YOUR ADVICE TO THE 
PRESIDENT ON DEALING WITH THIS?
>> Translator: NO ONE WISHES FOR
THERE TO BE A WAR ANYWHERE IN 
THE WORLD, BUT IT'S TRUE THAT 
THE RECENT EVENTS IN NORTH 
KOREA, WITH IMPLICATIONS IN THE 
NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES, VERY 
IMPORTANT COUNTRIES AND -- MEANS
THAT WE ALL HAVE TO BE FORCEFUL.
AND THOSE OF US WHO DEFEND THE 
VALUES OF DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM AND
HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE TO LET NORTH 
KOREA KNOW THAT IT ISN'T GOING 
ANYWHERE IN THAT DIRECTION.
FOR THE TIME BEING, SECTIONS 
HAVE BEEN ADOPTED.
SPAIN WILL SUPPORT ANY POLITICAL
DECISION WHICH WILL CONTRIBUTE 
TO PUTTING AN END TO THIS 
SITUATION, WHICH HAS NOTHING TO 
DO WITH THE PRINCIPLES AND 
VALUES.
MOST OF WESTERN AND GLOBAL 
DEMOCRACIES DEFEND.
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> THANK YOU.
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER DURING 
YOUR CONVERSATION YOU DISCUSSED 
THE CATALAN SITUATION, AND THIS 
IS A QUESTION FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP.
DO YOU SUPPORT WHAT THE SPANISH 
GOVERNMENT IS DOING REGARDING 
CATALONIA, I'D LIKE TO ASK THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE SPANISH 
GOVERNMENT WHETHER HE FEARS 
THERE MIGHT BE A UNILATERAL 
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN 
CATALONIA, WHAT WILL THE 
GOVERNMENT DO THEN?
>> WELL, I THINK SPAIN IS A 
GREAT COUNTRY AND IT SHOULD 
REMAIN UNITED.
WE'RE DEALING WITH A GREAT, 
GREAT COUNTRY AND IT SHOULD 
REMAIN UNITED.
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THAT UNFOLD.
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN UNFOLDING
FOR CENTURIES.
AND I THINK NOBODY KNOWS IF 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A VOTE.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A 
VOTE.
BUT I THINK THE PEOPLE WOULD BE 
VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO THAT.
I CAN SAY ONLY SPEAKING FOR 
MYSELF.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SPAIN 
CONTINUE TO BE UNITED.
>> Translator: THE DECISION TO 
UNILATERALLY DECLARE 
INDEPENDENCE IS NOT SOMETHING I 
WOULD -- IT'S NOT A DECISION I 
WOULD MAKE.
IT'S A DECISION WHICH WILL HAVE 
TO BE MADE.
OR NOT BY THE CATALAN 
GOVERNMENT.
I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY WRONG.
AND I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW, WHEN
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT THE 
REFERENDUM CAN TAKE PLACE 
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T AN ELECTORAL
COMMITTEE.
THERE ISN'T A TEAM OF THE 
CATALAN GOVERNMENT ORGANIZING 
THE REFERENDUM.
THERE AREN'T BALLOTS.
THERE AREN'T PEOPLE AT THE 
VOTING STATIONS.
SO, IT'S JUST CRAZY ALL THIS 
WILL LEAD TO IS NOISE.
BUT CERTAINLY, THERE CAN'T BE A 
VALID DEMOCRATIC REFERENDUM WITH
GUARANTEES, WITH MINIMUM 
GUARANTEES.
I THINK WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE IN
A SITUATION, SUCH AS THIS, IS TO
GO BACK TO COMMON SENSE AND PUT 
AN END TO THIS WHOLE STORY.
THE ONLY THING IT'S DOING IS 
GENERATING DIVISION, TENSIONS 
AND IT'S NOT CONTRIBUTING IN ANY
WAY TO THE CITIZEN SITUATION, I 
WANT THIS TO BE RESOLVED AS SOON
AS POSSIBLE.
AND I WANT US TO GO INTO A NEW 
STAGE WHERE THE RULE OF LAW, 
DIALOGUE AND COMMON SENSE WILL 
PREVAIL.
THANK YOU.
>> I THANK YOU.
MAJOR GARRETT, CBS.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON.
>> YES, HI.
>> -- IN TALKING ABOUT HOURS 
AWAY.
ARE YOU TRULY SATISFIED WITH 
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS DONE SO 
FAR?
AND CAN YOU TELL PEOPLE AND THE 
OFFICIALS THERE -- 
>> ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING THE 
DEPLOYMENT OF SPECIAL NAVAL 
ASSETS OR AIR ASSETS TO PUERTO 
RICO TO REJECT THE PROBLEMS 
THERE?
AND NORTH KOREA, VERY QUICKLY.
THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID HAD 
YOU HAVE DECLARED EFFECTIVELY A 
WAR ON NORTH KOREA.
AND THE NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT 
HAS THREATENED TO SHOOT DOWN OR 
AIM AT PLANES FLYING IN 
AIRSPACE.
I'D LIKE YOUR REACTION.
>> OKAY.
I'LL ANSWER THE SECOND ONE 
FIRST.
WE ARE TOTALLY PREPARED FOR THE 
SECOND OPTION.
NOT A PREFERRED OPTION.
IF WE TAKE THAT OPTION IT WILL 
BE DEVASTATING.
I CAN TELL YOU DEVASTATING FOR 
NORTH KOREA.
THAT'S CALLED THE MILITARY 
OPTION.
IF WE HAVE TO TAKE IT, WE WILL.
HE'S ACTING VERY BADLY.
HE'S SAYING THINGS THAT SHOULD 
NEVER, EVER BE SAID.
AND WE'RE REPLYING TO THOSE 
THINGS, BUT IT'S A REPLY.
IT'S NOT AN ORIGINAL SLIP, IT'S 
A REPLAY.
IN THE PAST WHAT WILL HE SAID, 
NORTH KOREA IS A SITUATION THAT 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED 25 
YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO, 15 
YEARS AGO, 10 YEARS AGO, 5 YEARS
AGO, AND IT COULD HAVE HANDLED 
MUCH MORE EASILY.
YOU HAD VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS,
MANY ADMINISTRATIONS, WHICH LEFT
ME A MESS.
BUT I'LL FIX THE MESS.
SO, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH 
NORTH KOREA.
AS FAR AS PUERTO RICO'S 
CONCERNED, I THINK JUST THE 
OPPOSITE.
WE HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS REVIEWS 
FROM GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AS WE
HAVE IN TEXAS AND LOUISIANA.
AND AS WE HAVE IN FLORIDA, AS 
YOU KNOW, FROM GOVERNOR SCOTT.
AND GREG ABBOTT, GREAT 
GOVERNORS.
AND THIS MORNING, THE GOVERNOR 
MADE INCREDIBLE STATEMENTS ABOUT
HOW WELL WE'RE DOING.
WE UNDERSTAND, IT'S A DISASTER.
IT'S A DISASTER.
THAT JUST HAPPENED.
THE GRID WAS IN BAD SHAPE BEFORE
THE STORM.
AND PUERTO RICO DIDN'T GET HIT 
BY ONE HURRICANE.
IT GOT HIT BY TWO HURRICANES.
AND THEY WERE AMONG THE BIGGEST 
WE'VE EVER SEEN, WITH THE SECOND
ONE BEING EVEN WORSE.
I MEAN, THE SECOND ONE HIT 
PUERTO RICO AS A CATEGORY 5.
I DON'T BELIEVE ANYBODY'S EVER 
SEEN THAT HAPPEN BEFORE.
HIT LAND WITH THAT KIND OF 
VELOCITY.
THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN EXTREMELY 
GENEROUS.
I APPRECIATED IT.
WE RIGHT NOW HAVE OUR TOP PEOPLE
FROM FEMA.
AND THEY HAVE BEEN THERE.
WE ARE UNLOADING ON AN HOURLY 
BASIS MASSIVE LOADS OF WATER, 
FOOD AND SUPPLIES FOR PUERTO 
RICO.
AND THIS ISN'T LIKE FLORIDA 
WHERE WE CAN GO RIGHT UP THE 
SPINE.
OR LIKE TEXAS WHERE WE GO RIGHT 
DOWN THE MIDDLE AND WE 
DISTRIBUTE.
THIS IS -- THINK ATLANTIC OCEAN.
THIS IS TOUGH STUFF.
THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN SO 
INCREDIBLE IN HIS STATEMENTS 
ABOUT THE JOB WE'RE DOING, WE'RE
DOING A GREAT JOB.
DON'T FORGET, THEIR POLICE FORCE
HAS BEEN DECIMATED.
BECAUSE MANY OF THE POLICE IN 
PUERTO RICO HAVE LOST THEIR 
HOMES.
SO, SURE, THEY WANT TO BE 
POLICE, BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO BE
ABLE TO WATCH THEIR FAMILIES AND
FIND THEIR FAMILIES.
AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE.
SO, WE'RE ALSO VERY MUCH 
INVOLVED IN SECURITY IN PUERTO 
RICO.
SO, EVERYBODY HAS SAID IT'S 
AMAZING THE JOB WE'VE DONE IN 
PUERTO RICO.
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF IT.
AND I'M GOING THERE ON TUESDAY.
NOW, WITH ALL OF THAT BEING 
SAID, RECORD -- RECORD -- IF YOU
LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF WATER 
DROPPED ON THAT ISLAND BETWEEN 
THE TWO HURRICANES, AND THE 
FIRST, THEY JUST BARELY GOT BY 
WITH, BUT THEY WERE DEVASTATED.
AND THE SECOND WAS A COMPLETE 
WIPEOUT.
I MEAN, THIS WAS A PLACE THAT 
WAS DESTROYED.
SO, I THINK WE'RE DOING A REALLY
GOOD JOB.
WE'RE CONTINUING TO.
WE'RE LITERALLY UNLOADING ON AN 
HOURLY BASIS.
WATER,YSUPPLIES.
WE HAVE OUR TOP PEOPLE FROM 
FEMA.
EVERYONE ELSE.
WE'RE DEPLOYED NAVY SHIPS.
THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED.
AND WE'RE GOING TO DO FAR MORE 
THAN ANYBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO 
DO.
AND IT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED AS 
SUCH.
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 
PRESIDENT?
>> MR. PRIME MINISTER, IF I MAY,
SIR, DO YOU SHARE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE 
VENEZUELAN REGIME?
AND WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXCEPTION THAT
THE U.S. INTERVENTION MIGHT BE 
REQUIRED WITH VENEZUELA?
AND DO YOU SUPPORT TOUGHER 
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE VENEZUELAN
GOVERNMENT?
>> Translator: WELL, WE'RE 
SPEARHEADING IN THE EUROPEAN 
UNION A PROPOSAL TO IMPOSE 
SANCTIONS ON VENEZUELA.
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN VENEZUELA 
IS UNACCEPTABLE.
VENEZUELA, TRADITIONALLY, WAS A 
DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.
AND AT THIS TIME, IT'S NO LONGER
A DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY.
THEY'RE POLITICAL PRISONERS IN 
VENEZUELA.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 
JAIL, ONLY BECAUSE THEY THINK 
DIFFERENTLY THAN MR. MADURO.
AND I WAS THE FIRST PRIME 
MINISTER TO -- THE WIFE WHO WAS 
JAILED BECAUSE MR. MADURO DIDN'T
LIKE HIM.
BUT THERE WERE MANY OTHERS SENT 
TO JAIL IN VENEZUELA.
THERE WAS A PARLIAMENT.
AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE UP 
THIS OTHER PARLIAMENT WHICH HAS 
ITS MEETING NEXT TO THE OTHER 
PARLIAMENT.
AND THAT'S LEGISLATION THAT 
CREATED A COMMISSION FOR THE 
TRUTH WHICH IS AN 
ANTI-DEMOCRATIC TOOL WHICH ONLY 
SERVES TO JUDGE PEOPLE WITHOUT 
RESPECTING MINIMUM HUMAN RIGHTS 
STANDARDS.
VENEZUELA IS ON THE ROAD TO 
DICTATORSHIP, UNLESS THAT CAN BE
STOPPED.
SO, ALL OF US WHO SHARED VALUES 
SUCH AS DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE TO DO 
SOMETHING.
AT THIS TIME.
SANCTIONS ARE IMPORTANT.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE 
INTERNATIONAL COALITION PUTTING 
PRESSURE ON MADURO, SO THAT 
POLITICAL PRISONERS ARE FREED 
AND DEMOCRACY IS RESTORED 
BECAUSE THIS LACK OF DEMOCRACY 
AND THE ATTACK AGAINST HUMAN 
RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS ARE COME -- 
COME IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
ECONOMIC -- TERRIBLE ECONOMIC 
SITUATION WITH THE 300% 
INFLATION RATE, WITH PROBLEMS 
SUPPLYING FOODS AND MEDICINES TO
PEOPLE.
SO, IT'S A REALLY TRAGIC 
SITUATION, AND I THINK WE 
HAVE -- WE, THE UNITED STATES 
AND SPAIN, HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY
TOWARDS VENEZUELA.
THERE ARE A LOT OF SPANIARDS 
LIVING IN VENEZUELA.
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THEM.
ABOUT THEM AND THE REST.
BUT THEY CERTAINLY WORRY ME.
SO I THINK THAT THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD 
BE FORCEFUL WITH REGARDS TO 
VENEZUELA.
>> THANK YOU.
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR EACH OF 
YOU, FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WITH THE SERIOUS POLITICAL 
CRISIS IN SPAIN, BECAUSE OF THE 
REFERENDUM ON SUNDAY, WHAT 
SOLUTION DO YOU THINK THERE IS?
HAVE YOU GIVEN ADVICE TO 
PRESIDENT RAJOY ON THIS MATTER?
DO YOU THINK THERE SHOULD BE A 
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE GENERAL AND
THE NOW A SOLUTION FOR PRESIDENT
RAJOY, IT SEEMS THE WAY YOU'RE 
MANAGING THINGS IN CATALONIA HAS
HAD AN IMPACT ON THE BUDGET?
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW 
WHETHER YOU THINK THE SITUATION 
WITH THE PMV PARTY CAN BE 
RESOLVED OR HAVE TO CALL 
ELECTIONS?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> WELL I THINK THE PEOPLE OF 
CATALONIA HAVE BEEN TALKING 
ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT I
BET IF YOU HAVE ACCURATE 
NUMBERS, ACCURATE POLLING, 
YOU'LL FIND THEY LOVE THEIR 
COUNTRY, THEY LOVE SPAIN.
SO I'M JUST FOR UNITED SPAIN.
I SPEAK AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, AS SOMEBODY THAT 
HAS GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR 
PRESIDENT AND ALSO HAS REALLY 
GREAT RESPECT FOR YOUR COUNTRY, 
I REALLY THINK THE PEOPLE OF 
CATALONIA WOULD STAY WITH SPAIN.
I THINK IT WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT 
TO.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STAYING 
WITH A TRULY GREAT, BEAUTIFUL 
AND VERY HISTORIC COUNTRY.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Translator: WE WILL BE 
DELAYING THE BUDGET IN 
PARLIAMENT BECAUSE WE THINK THAT
WHEN WE SUBMIT THE BUDGETS, WE 
WILL NEED THE NEEDED SUPPORT TO 
APPROVE THEM.
WE'RE TALKING WITH DIFFERENT 
POLITICAL PARTIES, AS YOU KNOW.
AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ANY
PROBLEMS, IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK
DOWN THIS LINE.
I DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE ANY 
PROBLEMS IN APPROVING THEM 
WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING FOR A 
MAJORITY, JUST LIKE WE DID LAST 
TIME AROUND WHEN WE VOTED FOR 
BUDGET.
AT ANY RATE, I'M NOT THINKING AT
ALL ABOUT CALLING THE ELECTIONS 
AS A RESULT OF WHAT WE'RE 
SEEING.
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
THANK YOU.
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP WRAPPING UP 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE THERE WITH 
THE PRESIDENT OF SPAIN MARIANO 
RAJOY.
LOTS OF NEWS FROM THE PRESIDENT.
THE QUESTIONS HE STARTED OUT 
TALKING ABOUT THE NFL AGAIN.
SAYING HE WAS ASHAMED OF WHAT 
HE'S SEEING IN THE NFL AND 
CALLING ON TO PASS A RULE FROM 
KNEELING.
THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAYING 
TOTALLY PREPARED TO TAKE THE 
MILITARY OPTION WITH NORTH 
KOREA'S NUCLEAR THREAT.
WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING
FINAL WORD FROM THE SENATE.
SENATE REPUBLICANS NOW SAY THERE
WILL NOT BE A VOTE ON THIS 
LATEST EFFORT TO REPEAL AND 
REPLACE OBAMACARE.
THEY HAD A SEPTEMBER 30th 
DEADLINE.
THEY DID NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT 
THERE FOR THE BILL.
A LOT OF NEWS THERE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT, AND FOR THE 
PRESIDENT.
JON KARL IN THE ROSE GARDEN.
>> GEORGE, TO TAKE TWO BIG 
TOPICS, NORTH KOREA AND THE NFL.
AGAIN, FIRM WORDS FROM THE 
PRESIDENT, NOT BACKING DOWN FROM
THE TYPE OF RHETORIC WE HEARD 
FROM HIM AT THE UNITED NATIONS, 
MAKING IT CLEAR THAT HE'S MORE 
THAN PREPARED TO RESPONSE 
MILITARILY IF NECESSARY TO 
ANYTHING THAT THE NORTH KOREANS 
MAY DO.
AS NOTED IN THE QUESTION THE 
NORTH KOREAN FOREIGN MINISTER 
HAS ALREADY SAID THAT THE UNITED
HAS DECLARED WAR ON HIS COUNTRY 
WITH THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS.
AND ON THE NFL ABSOLUTELY NO 
BACKING DOWN THERE WHATSOEVER.
HE WAS ASKED IF HE HAD BEEN TOOL
PREOCCUPIED WITH THE NFL 
FOLLOWING THE CRISIS IN PUERTO 
RICO.
HE SAID HE WASN'T PREOCCUPIED, 
HE SAID HE WAS ASHAMED BY THE 
ACTIONS OF THE NFL PLAYERS 
PROTESTING DURING THE NATIONAL 
ANTHEM.
ABSOLUTELY NOT BACKING DOWN.
YOU GET THE SENSE THAT IS AN 
ISSUE THAT THE PRESIDENT WANTS 
TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN.
>> ALL OF THIS OVERWHELMING 
FAILURE OF THAT EFFORT TO REPEAL
AND REPLACE OBAMACARE.
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE'S WORKING 
ON THAT SINCE HIS FIRST DAY IN 
OFFICE.
WE'RE GOING OFF THE AIR.
MUCH MORE WITH DAVID MUIR 
TONIGHT.

I'M GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS I'LL 
SEE YOU TOMORROW ON
