I HAVE
BREAKING NEWS.
SUCH AS IT IS.
KANYE WEST HAS IN FACT PUBLICLY
DECLARED HIS LOVE FOR DONALD
TRUMP, HE SAID IT IN A TWEET
THAT HIS LOVE WILL BE UNABATED
DESPITE WHAT THE MOB SAYS, AND
THAT HE HAS FREEDOM OF THOUGHT,
AND THAT HE AND DONALD ARE
DRAGONS TOGETHER.
>>HE HAS DRAGON BLOOD.
>>OKAY, I DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE
TARGARYENS.
I THOUGHT DONALD
TRUMP WAS BARATHEON, JOFFREY
SPECIFICALLY.
SO DONALD TRUMP
RETWEETED WITH A THANK YOU AND
MUCH LOVE OR SOMETHING ALONG
THOSE LINES, SO PEAS IN A POD.
JOHN, A FUN LITTLE GAME HERE,
LET'S GET IT STARTED, WE AREN'T
GOING TO DO IT, YOU GUYS ARE,
I'LL GIVE YOU A WAY TO GET IT
GOING, WHICH IS LET'S NAME THE
REALITY SHOW THAT THEY WILL
INEVITABLY HAVE TOGETHER AS SOON
AS DONALD TRUMP IS IMPEACHED.
SO, ONE OBVIOUS ONE IS DUMB AND
DUMBER.
OKAY.
ANOTHER ONE THAT I
SUGGESTED ONLINE IS BOSOM
BUDDIES.
THERE IS NO PLAY ON
WORDS THERE.
AND THEN THERE IS
TRADING PLACES, SO WHEN TRUMP
GETS IMPEACHED KANYE CAN TAKE
OVER, HE MAY BE RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, HE PUT OUT A TWEET
THAT JUST SAYS 2024.
I LIKE GAME
OF LOANS.
>>THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
>>THE GOOD HAVE A CONTEST FOR
WHO IS GOING TO GO OUT OF
BUSINESS FIRST, TRUMP HAS DONE
IT SIX TIMES, KANYE HAS
DONE IT ONCE BUT SPECTACULARLY,
HE'S $53 MILLION IN DEBT.
>>IF IT'S A REALITY SHOW I WOULD
GO WITH BANKRUPTCY SURVIVOR.
OR
POSSIBLY SECRETLY SUPPORTING BIG
BROTHER.
>>AND I HAVE A NEW NICKNAME FOR
THESE BOSOM BUDDIES, DONYE.
WE
CAN GET THAT STARTED.
THERE WAS
KIMYE, NOW THERE IS DONYE.
YOU
CAN USE IT AS A HASHTAG IF YOU
LIKE.
SO IN THE COMMENT SECTION
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS LATER,
GIVE US SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR
WHAT WE SHOULD NAME THEIR
UPCOMING DISASTROUS REALITY SHOW
AFTER TRUMP IS OUT OF OFFICE AND
AFTER KANYE IS IN.
KANYE IS SO
STUPID HE THINGS HE COULD BE
PRESIDENT.
TWO MENTALLY
CHALLENGED PEAS IN A POD.
GIVE
PEAS A CHANCE.
>>
>>I WAS GOING TO TALK ABOUT
THIS, NOT AS A FULL STORY, BUT I
WAS GOING TO MENTION IT, BECAUSE
WE ARE BEYOND SELF-PARODY, WE
ARE A SELF-PARODY PARODY AT THIS
POINT I THINK OUR COUNTRY IS A
JOKE AND THE JOKE IS ON US.
A
LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO BE VIEWING
THIS AS IF THEY ARE OUTSIDERS TO
WHAT IS GOING ON, AS IF ALL THE
TERRIBLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
NEWS IS JUST LIKE, THAT THEY ARE
LOOKING AT A COUNTRY IT'S
HAPPENING TO, BUT IT'S HAPPENING
TO US, IT'S HURTING US, AND IT'S
UNBEARABLE.
>>WE ARE THE FIRST ONES, AND WE
WON'T BE THE LAST ONES, TO
COMPARE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO TO
IDIOCRACY.
BUT WITH KANYE AND
DONALD TRUMP TEAMING UP IT'S
ALMOST THE EXACT PLOT LINE.
WE
ARE THIS CLOSE TO JUST
CALLING IT IDIOCRACY.
MAYBE THAT WILL BE THE NAME OF
THE REALITY SHOW.
