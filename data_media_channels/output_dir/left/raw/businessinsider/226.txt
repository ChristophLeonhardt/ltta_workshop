1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
- [Interviewer] Trump says--
- He's not a racist, right.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,950
- [Interviewer] He's
the least racist person.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:04,783
Do you believe him?

4
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:05,770
- He's a liar.

5
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,290
- [Narrator] This is Patrisse Cullors.

6
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,310
She's one of the three
founders of Black Lives Matter.

7
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,650
We got her thoughts about President Trump,

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,670
alternative jails and the
future of the movement

9
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,840
she helped start.

10
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:21,940
(crowd chanting)

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,550
- Black Lives Matter was
a response to the death

12
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,780
of Trayvon Martin and the
acquittal of his shooter,

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,000
George Zimmerman.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,860
The movement has since
grown into a global network

15
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,040
with dozens of chapters.

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,640
But Patrisse says the issues

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,860
with injustice for African Americans,

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,350
particularly by police,

19
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,020
started years before
the Zimmerman verdict.

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,210
- My very early memories of
LAPD is them raiding my home

21
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,260
when I was probably five or six years old.

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,624
Then living out the next decade and a half

23
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:57,624
with cops in our buildings,
in our homes, on our streets,

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:00,990
and not there to support us.

25
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:03,910
- [Narrator] In her new memoir,

26
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,700
When They Call You a Terrorist,

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,299
Patrisse talks about her
brother, Monte Cullors,

28
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:12,090
who was diagnosed with a
mental illness while in jail.

29
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,750
He was awaiting trial
for evading an officer,

30
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,420
when he had a violent
confrontation with a deputy.

31
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,960
- The experience gave
me so much compassion

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,570
for people in his condition,

33
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,070
but it also was deeply enraging

34
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,760
because instead of my brother receiving

35
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,030
care and dignity and real treatment,

36
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,420
he was only, only offered criminalization.

37
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,180
- [Narrator] Fast forward to 2013,

38
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,420
George Zimmerman is acquitted
in Trayvon Martin's death.

39
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,277
- I didn't think he was gonna get off.

40
00:01:48,277 --> 00:01:50,180
I didn't think he was gonna get murder,

41
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,190
because white people don't get murder,

42
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,640
but maybe manslaughter.

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,900
We all knew he killed a child.

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,060
So what was the big hang up?

45
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,900
I just was like, "This can't be it.

46
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,920
"This can't be the way this happens.

47
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,470
"This can't be the final say."

48
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,790
And I went onto social media

49
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,910
searching for other people's responses.

50
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,290
I went onto Alicia Garza's Facebook.

51
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,490
She and I have been friends for years

52
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,310
and she wrote a love note to black people

53
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,320
and she closed it out
with black lives matter

54
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,860
and I saw those three
words and I was like,

55
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,770
hashtag black lives matter.

56
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,625
- [Woman] Put your hands up!

57
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:26,458
- [Crowd] Don't shoot.

58
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,291
- [Woman] Put your hands up!

59
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,410
- [Crowd] Don't shoot.

60
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,170
- [Narrator] A year later,
she organized a freedom ride

61
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,485
in protest in Ferguson, Missouri,

62
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,000
after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
by police officer Darren Wilson.

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,120
The unrest in Ferguson led
to a wide wave of support

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
and criticism.

66
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,650
- [News Reporter] We have
witnessed lawlessness

67
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,170
and chaos on the streets.

68
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,590
- [Narrator] The next year,
unrest in Baltimore broke out

69
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,070
over 25 year old Freddie Gray

70
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:56,450
who was killed while being
transported in a police van.

71
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,890
More chapters formed as
more protests took place

72
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,210
all around the country.

73
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:05,500
Now in 2018, Black Lives
Matter has 50 plus chapters

74
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,780
and a reputation, for better or worse,

75
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,666
known around the world.

76
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,710
- It's all lives matter and
that should be the theme

77
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,920
of this country, frankly.

78
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,130
One of our themes.

79
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,710
- [Narrator] Trump has openly criticized

80
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,840
Black Lives Matter activists
and the movement before.

81
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,765
But Trump has repeatedly
denied being a racist.

82
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:24,780
- No, no I'm not a racist.

83
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,220
I am the least racist person
you have ever interviewed.

84
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,890
- He's a liar.

85
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:31,723
He's a liar!

86
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:33,280
"I'm gonna create a Muslim ban,

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,240
"I'm gonna create a wall."

88
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,310
and then to say in the same breath,

89
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,370
"I'm not a racist."

90
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,600
is just a lie.

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,050
And it's very dangerous when we allow them

92
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,640
to decide who they are.

93
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,440
We already know that that's racist.

94
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,070
- [Narrator] We asked
Patrisse if she could see

95
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,320
a day in America where
there wouldn't be a need

96
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,570
for Black Lives Matter anymore.

97
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,260
- We just had a civil rights
movement 40 years ago.

98
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,556
People act as if that's ancient history.

99
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:03,550
My mother lived during that time.

100
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,560
And so it's going to take
decades for us to win

101
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,130
and probably centuries for us to win.

102
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,180
And that winning will look like

103
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,150
black people being able
to live in a country

104
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,950
where they don't fear for their life.

105
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,589
That living will look like black women

106
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,599
being able to go give birth

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,900
without the risk of dying
during birth or after birth.

108
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,530
That will look like black people thriving

109
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:28,630
and I don't know if I can see that.

110
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,150
I can pray for it, but it's
something much more lofty

111
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,840
that I don't think exists
in this current moment.

112
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,354
- [Narrator] But she did
tell us about the steps

113
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:40,730
that can be taken now to
make that future possible.

114
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:44,870
- We actually need
alternatives to incarceration

115
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,840
in order to have a sustainable America.

116
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,420
And alternatives to incarceration

117
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,463
simply look like divesting

118
00:04:51,463 --> 00:04:56,010
from using jails to treat
people with mental illness.

119
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,690
It is an oxymoron to have
a mental health jail.

120
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,620
We can spend it in providing communities

121
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,620
access to housing, access to
shelter, access to green space.

122
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,260
If we were to just change
these things over time,

123
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,070
we would see a decrease in the US jail

124
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,250
and prison population.

125
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,230
We have a significant amount of people

126
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,370
who are in jail because of marijuana use,

127
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,680
or marijuana selling.

128
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,120
We have a significant amount of people

129
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,590
who are in there for petty theft

130
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,930
because they're hungry,

131
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,170
because they had to feed their children

132
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,822
and so they decided to
go to a grocery store

133
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,450
and steal some food.

134
00:05:29,450 --> 00:00:00,000
Those are social ills,
not criminal issues.
