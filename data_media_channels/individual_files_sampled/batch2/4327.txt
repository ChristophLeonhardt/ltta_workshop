and tonight's panel Shana Thomas the Washington bureau chief at vice news George will an MSNBC contributor and a syndicated columnist and Maria Teresa Kumar an MSNBC contributor and president and CEO voto Latino Georgia um we start with you the president this morning says stop it with immigration and then he does this event in the afternoon essentially saying let's politicize it more but let's not deal with them they don't legislate in Congress anymore as you know they Darren no they don't vote on things he was elected pundits five of them so I'm saying to stop doing something that you weren't going to do anyway second in a way he's exercising leadership because his base likes what he's doing and a good many others who which means millions of Americans are pleased by this can I give you a little rant on the subject of zero tolerance any policy anywhere on any subject at any time the design based on zero tolerance of X is going to fail because the whole point of zero tolerance is to make it unnecessary indeed impossible to think to exercise judgment all over the country it's now summer and twelve-year-old kids are sitting up lemonade stands all over the country to sell $0.25 shots of lemonade and police are showing up or other government enforcers to say you didn't pay your five hundred dollar business license and it down but they're not doing that is what you're saying they're showing some judgments yeah in Maryland welcome this happens that a couple a kid in Maryland a few years ago did but a little boy will do he's seven years old he had a rectangular safe breakfast pastry he chewed it into the shape of a gun and said bang bang suspended from school and all kinds of panic ensued over violence in our schools no judgment anywhere and what you're seeing now at the border is an absence of judgment institutionalized end of rant and over the leadership issue well I mean I think there is something to be said for is he a leader if he is pitting the pain of these people who have lost their children who have lost their family members in what seems to be violent crime which is a valid thing to talk about with the pain of parents and kids who are being ripped apart and trying to use either one of those for political gain is not leadership it's just not and I do agree with with mr. well that yes there are there are people in his base who do appreciate what he's trying to do and I don't think talking about immigration or being harsh on immigration is necessarily a bad thing but how we do it and whether we can show compassion about it and who neither of those parents and either of those issues is right or wrong they both have valid concerns but how you do this and what you say about it is actually very very important become political pawns in this process well and that's what he doesn't Trump does very well is actually create political pawns and make straw man arguments in order for him to advance his base the reason that he's trying to politicize immigration though is because he realized that during the primary they basically had nothing with the tax the recent primaries they were hoping that the tax reform was actually going to rally the base it did not instead they ran 14,000 ads of anti immigrants and that rally the base most recently so he recognizes that that is one of the only things absent any other policy that can actually fix an issue that actually will actually bring out the base the problem though is I was literally just at the border two days ago in McAllen I witnessed a stream of vans coming in full of families and then the vans would come back empty it's chilling the stories that you're hearing from inside the ground on the ground were with with a lot of grassroots organizers where they're witnessing twenty and twenty children at in a room crying themselves to sleep because they cannot be soothed this is not who we are this idea that he said well we're going to end my policy that I started let me ask this question we're not treating this as a refugee crisis but it is a refugee is it different that we trying to come in that's exactly right there are those who are looking for economic improvement of their lives those are migrants right and there's a then there's people running in fear right the Haitians were were refugees where I was where I grew up in Miami when they came over they were they were escaping you know fear so is that a part of the issue but the challenge is that he's actually convoluted everything and everybody's hair is on fire we I would say that we actually have three issues right now in this country we have to solve the 11 million that have been living here for the last 10 15 years in our shadows get them out of the shadows and have a conversation how we do that yes we need border enforcement but then we also have to have a strong conversation on future immigration flows what's happening at the border is not how dealing with future immigration flows it's talking about refugees families that are literally turned versing three to four countries with their parents with their children trying to save themselves and George the history of this country is asylum policy and Refugee policy the more you look at it it's always been done under duress we actually don't have a good policy because it's always been written under duress the Hungarians the Cubans the Vietnamese I mean we can go on and on you can make an argument that the default position of the United States from a moral point of view should be that someone from El Salvador or Guatemala or Honduras is presumptively a refugee not just not just someone seeking economic gain mm-hmm well and but I think we can't we can't think that this administration is actually going to do any kind of programs to help out in El Salvador or in Honduras or anything like that like some of this has been dabbled with in previous administrations but unless the United States is willing to go in and say how can we help so that your people do not have to come further north then this is not going to change we're still going to have this problem right well and the when we talk about the immigration crisis there actually is no crisis with net enumeration since 2008 we've basically been it's been neutral the people that are coming in right now are because they're they have root causes right now in Central America that we are not addressing and I would like to remind the audience it was an issue that we exported the gigs that came that were created they came out of Los Angeles they were basically indoctrinated in Los Angeles we shipped them off to countries that were vulnerable that did not have the systems and basically we helped create a criminal a criminal system that did not exist before and if the president has a metabolic urge to build a wall he should build it not on 1,700 miles across our southern border but on the 500 miles on the Guatemalan Mexican border well and this goes to is the best way to get Mexican help Mexico to help us out with this is to rip up NAFTA and beat the living daylights out of Mexico I mean I'm being facetious here George but his style Democrats only want open borders they love the criminals Mexico doesn't care they're just well if you keep treating them that way maybe Mexico's gonna say yeah go right ahead well he's doing this in the midst of a pretty interesting election campaign in Mexico and whoever wins that and I think we know who's going to win it and mr. Bress is going to talk about this is not going to have any debt owed indeed he's going to have a mandate to be difficult to mr. Trump that's right and President Vice President Biden actually went down to Mexico and they came up with a with an agreement after the first surge happened under President Obama in 2014 so there was an agreement those bets are all off because we are not engaging with our allies and actually how do we deal with international incidences the president continues to try to paint this as a criminal problem I do want to put together we put together at any point he continues to put this in just a crime issue take a listen Shawn they could be murderers and thieves and so much else you'll have killings you'll have murders you'll have this you have that you have crime they endanger all of our children we still have to maintain toughness or our country will be overrun by people by crime their drug traffickers their human traffickers their coyotes I mean we get in some real beauties look you go just you don't have to go far actually you can go all the way into the beginning of our history we always seem to find a way to classify a new group of people that are trying to come into this country as criminals thieves murderers I think at one time since southern Italians were the mongrelization of America I mean it's been even worse than some of this language but this is actually very familiar to our history yeah it's to make it's to make them feel like they are unworthy to be here it's to make them feel like you do not belong in this situation I do think it's worth noting that you know he isn't saying anything he hasn't said before I realized that that montage was basically from this week right but the campaign Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday it could have been any Monday sixteen it could have been and I will say this for him he's consistent this is no one should be surprised that this is what this government is doing George I think the weird thing about this the fact that we've sustained this sort of nativist streak that's happening in one part of the Republican Party the economy is good usually the nativists rise up when the economy's shaky the economy is so good that there are more jobs available than there are jobless which is to say we need immigrants not just immigrants in the agriculture sector where they're constantly needed but if mr. Trump is going to build his wall along our southern border he's probably gonna have to do it with the illegal immigrant labor that's how sure construction laborer is in this country well not only that in the fear is some of these folks don't even come in temporarily to do the picking because there's fear one of the biggest pieces that I heard from McAllen was that their economy is down because people that would basically cross the border just to do cotton everyday Commerce all of us and cannot last year the target CEO basically said that that their target sales cut along the border was down 11% it's impacting the economy in really large ways that it's going to reverie not just the border enforcement is that used time was four decades people would go over and come back then we sealed the borders away if we can't go over and come back we're gonna stay here because we can't come back and then you have and then and then of course it only creates more demonization of what's on the other side the the other fact is we do have this gang issue is there a way of separating it out but the gang issue is so small it's so miniscule I think that we have to have I have to we have to be rough on that's what I mean can we separate we know he doesn't but is there a clean way to separate it out I mean I think yeah I think there is and I think that we have had those mechanisms but I do have the reason that Trump started his campaign basically classifying Mexicans as criminals and as rapists is because he was basically singing the dog whistle Latinos are the second largest group of Americans in this country they're the ones that have the potential of having an incredible voting bloc and he was basically the dog whistle all around to his neighbors saying you know what I know our country's changing really quickly most most leaders would have said yes changing really quickly what's actually embracing let's actually prepare for that future I do think we have to be careful with the gang issue and the ms-13 issue just in that is media if we seem to be pushing it aside in any way because it is an important issue in some of these places you talked to Pete King you talked to people up in New York they are worried go to Annandale Virginia okay I mean this is not it is that like a made-up problem but it's also not part of the immigration issue no it's not part of the immigration issue but we don't want to dismiss it because then we're the liberal media who's just dismissing it hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more beat the press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on youtube subscribe now
