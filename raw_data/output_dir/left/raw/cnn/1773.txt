00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,990
it's interesting to see what the
president said before he was president

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,150
so here's a tweet from 2013 it's
relevant it was about the Redskins and

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,019
he tweeted then when he was just Donald
Trump presidents should not be telling

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,910
the Washington Redskins it changed their
name our country has far bigger problems

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,939
exclamation point focused on them not
nonsense

6
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,099
so I mean then you have to say well why
now why is he wearing in on the culture

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,840
why is he throwing a grenade into the
culture wars and you know a lot of

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,770
people have speculated it's the art of
distraction if health care isn't going

9
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,590
well
if the Russia investigation seems to be

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,710
encroaching on Paul Manafort time for a
culture war consistency has never been

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,399
his strong suit Allison and I think it's
just a pattern we've seen over the

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,940
course of the last nine months there
really hasn't been an effort to build

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,180
bridges it's been politically speaking
all about reinforcing the 46 percent who

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:00,000
gave him his victory
