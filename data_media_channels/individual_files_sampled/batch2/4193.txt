anyhow alright we'll begin though with President Trump reigniting the controversy around his campaigns June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians tweeting on Sunday fake news reporting a complete fabrication that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son this is always bad when he does this Donald had in Trump Tower this was a meeting to get information on an opponent totally legal and done all the time in politics and it went nowhere I did not know about it this means he knew about it and his son really messed up realize right boom-boom-boom he appears to be referring to the Washington Post reporting quote Trump has confided to friends and advisers that he is worried the Muller probe could destroy the lives of what he calls innocent and decent people remember when he called you about Miller Joe anyhow namely Trump jr. who is under scrutiny by Muller for his role in organizing a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton let me help you understand that's bad you know he's up and tweeting as one adviser described the president's thinking he does not believe his son purposefully broke the law it's ignorance of the law is actually a never mind but is fearful nonetheless that Trump jr. inadvertently may have wandered into legal jeopardy on Saturday former communications director hope Hicks was spotted on the tarmac joining the president on his trip to Ohio according to Trump juniors Senate testimony Hicks was in the middle of the president dictating his son's misleading statement about adoptions to the New York Times followed by explanations that quickly unraveled politics is not the nicest business in the world but it's very standard where they have information and you take the information in the case of Don he listened guess they talked about as I see it they talked about adoption and some things there was nothing that as far as we know that would lead anyone to believe that there was anything except for a discussion about adoption the Majin ski act the president didn't sign off on on anything was coming back from the g20 the the statement that was released on Saturday was released by Donald Trump jr. and I'm sure in consultation with his lawyers the president wasn't involved in that he certainly didn't dictate but you know he like I said he weighed in offered suggestion like any father would do it really is gentleman breathtaking I were used to the lying but on something this big perhaps the most important part of this entire investigation everything you heard from every White House representative there was a lie and Donald Trump admitted this weekend they were all lying what are the consequences of this well I don't know what the consequences are but I know that it's an indication that that the some folks here are not just in serious trouble but now recognize they're in serious trouble and I think if you asked the question Joe you know last week we watched as Donald Trump when when further deeper into the realm of like public obstruction of justice when he started attacking the Moller probe starts suggesting that that the Attorney General should shut it down we now have a pretty clear explanation for why that is which is that the president now is looking at the Manafort trial starting to focus on rick gates starting to focus on some of the things that perhaps michael cohen has told investigators about this meeting about what might have led up to it about who might have known what about it in advance about what the president's role might have been about what Donald juniors role certainly was we already have a lot of email on an email trail on that and as the president has started to recognize and we do use all the various metaphors but walls closing in and the facts that the actual facts are starting to become closer and closer to the surface and corroborating witnesses are starting to either come forward or be appear to about to be come forward the president is in the exact 180 degree opposite to what his statement in the tweet says I said mica suggested just second ago you know if he's up and tweeting about how he's not concerned about a dog Trump jr. he's concerned about Donald Trump jr. he's he's concerned about Donald Trump jr. and Phil Rucker he's he's concerned that Donald Trump jr. may have stumbled into some illegal territory on his own also obviously he's got to be concerned by the fact that again it's going to be coming out not only whether it's in the mana for trial or somewhere else that it's obvious that me from the very beginning was to get information from foreign nationals in this case the Russians which is a crime they can run around people lawyers running on collusion is not a crime clean anybody knows a lowly ranking congressman like I was in my first year understood you can't get an in-kind contribution from you know mullahs in Iran or Vladimir Putin in Russia that's right Joe and the president is concerned he's anxious he's fearful about where this is all headed his legal team is focused on that Trump Tower meeting as they happen for some time that is a key moment in the Moller investigation but our reporting despite what the president tweeted in response to it very much is that he's worried about Don junior he's expressed that worry to the people that he's been talking to on the phone he's been privately brooding over this sort of a feeling very uneasy that Muller seems to be inching closer and closer to the Oval Office to the people in the president circle and that's why you've seen him the president lashing out on Twitter lashing out at these campaign rallies tearing into the media tweeting about the witch-hunt more and more and more tweeting about Robert Muller by name more and more and more that's how he's channeling all of that frustration and fear you know it's important to keep reviewing the facts especially as the president and others try and muddle them on Twitter thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories and you can click on any of the videos around us to watch more 4
