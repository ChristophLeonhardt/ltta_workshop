there is a rumor that in order you know in order for a Rolex to actually leave the factory or be a Rolex design it has to be recognizable from 20 feet away hi I'm Cara Barrett editor at Howe dinky the leading online watch publication Rolex is one of the few brands if not the only brand that has a very specific aesthetic they are sporty they are active they are tool watches that's kind of their main DNA in the 50s they came out with the Submariner the Explorer the Mel Gauss the GMT and they were all watches that were designed and made to be used as tools and so that's their bread and butter and it still is today it kind of evolved into a luxury brand later in life which now is what they're known for so that's kind of the interesting thing about them as they initially were to watches which are now have now become luxury Rolex is kind of one of those brands that sits on the lower end of the spectrum as far as luxury watches are concerned the Submariner is $8,000 the entry-level watch at Rolex is 5 with the Oyster Perpetual they're three qualities are self-winding waterproof and precision and they really focus on quality it takes one year to make Rolex they go through extensive testing the accuracy the chronometer the timing it's all about telling the right time keeping the right time they also have extensive service work after so if you ever have a problem with your Rolex you can take it to them and they'll fix it the clasp is opened and closed a thousand times before it leaves so you know that when you get it it's not gonna break the whole point of a Rolex is you buy one now it will last you for 20 years if you take care of it it'll last for 100 if you really take care of it that's ultimately why they're so expensive because you you're buying something that will last you a lifetime presumably and something that you can pass down to other generations as well in the collectors world there's the vintage Rolex market and there's a whole underground of different you know nuances you know there's a GMT with a mac dial a GMT with a gilt dial and they're all these different tiny tiny little details that change and they make a watch more or less valuable there's the poem in Daytona which sold for seventeen point eight million dollars last fall and that's the expensive Rolex that's ever sold at auction the Paul Newman Daytona is a really good example where they came out of the Daytona back in the 70s and they put these exotic dials on them they couldn't sell them and now they're the most collectible watches on the vintage market no one knows how many Rolexes are produced per year no one knows how many worlds are produced per model but there are different specific ones like the rainbow Daytona that came out this year rumored to have an X amount made the very small quantities and you don't ever know exactly what the number is but you do know that there aren't that many and they're hard to get one of the best things about Rolex is you anyone can wear any of them they're very unisex and I think that's refreshing because a lot of times brands are you know put a lot of diamonds on watch ins I'm gonna braid it as women's watch or as roller says the same thing but it's you know kind of unisex so I wear a lot of menthol lights but the ladies date just is actually in two-tone is actually the most sold Rolex model of all time it doesn't really come back
