the Fed secretary James Madison chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford briefed both the entire House of Representative and Senate yesterday regarding the strategy and airstrikes in Syria comes as military and administration officials tell the New York Times mattis urged Trump to get congressional approval before the air strike saying it's important to get public support for military operations however he was overruled by the president who The Times reports wanted a quote rapid and dramatic response joining us now from Washington member of the Foreign Relations Committee Democratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut Senator des moines it's good to have you with us you've called these strikes in Syria illegal it appears the Secretary of Defense agrees at least in principle with you that there should have been consultation with Congress before the strike was launched the Constitution is pretty clear here the executive doesn't have the power to declare war or initiate military action without Congress in the absence of an attack against the United States or an imminent threat of an attack I asked director Pompeo at the confirmation hearing whether Syria had attacked us or whether we were at threat of being attacked and he admitted of course that neither were true so you know the danger here is that there really is no limit to what the president can do if he can get away with these relatively large-scale attacks on Syria without congressional authorization for instance what would constrain him from launching an even bigger attack on North Korea as a pre-emptive action regarding their nuclear program none of this happens in a vacuum so he may say well it's just a targeted surgical strike but in a crowded battle space like Syria it could prompt as mattis has admitted a serious counter response from the Russians the Iranians or the Syrians drawing us into a more serious war and the idea that the the match could be lit without any public debate without any authorization from Congress sets I think a really dangerous precedent as you know this is not a problem exclusive to this president there have been complaints about President Obama President Bush President Clinton before him if President Trump had come before you in the Senate and asked for a vote on the Syrian strikes how would you have voted I would have voted against them and I actually had the chance to vote on a strike of this same kind in the Obama administration he actually as you know came before Congress and asked for authorization the full Senate didn't vote on it but the Foreign Relations Committee did and I was one of the few no votes so I've been consistent in both administrations in my belief that these surgical strikes in the absence of a broader strategy to take out Assad simply make the situation worse for the Syrian people what we saw after last year's strike of about sixty Tomahawk missiles is that Assad frankly quickened the pace of the assault on his own people and there was an escalation of the fight inside the country so I know it makes us feel good when we launched these strikes but it doesn't actually a munition of already an appropriate response I think you agree that you can't stand by and watch chemical weapons launched against civilians so what would have been an appropriate strike well again I don't think that ultimately a military strike is the right way to go here I think ultimately you need to have a process by which you hold Assad accountable as a war criminal you engage in a diplomatic process and you try to get everybody out of Syria that wants to get out what we're doing now is bombing Syria you know in a way that doesn't actually have any long-term consequence for Assad well locking people in that country having taken only 11 Syrian refugees this year Scotty K here and we're hearing the same thing by the way that you've been hearing about reports that the Assad regime is already clamping down on civilians and kicking back against his own people after these strikes so they seem to be the ones that are suffering because of America and France and Britain launched these strikes but five days after these strikes does it seem to you that the threat of retaliation either by Russia or Iran or Hezbollah against perhaps US interests in the region do you think that's gone now does it look like this was a one-off strike and and the kind of military playing field has been leveled and we've moved on or do you think there could be still retaliation I was at the briefing yesterday with general mattis it certainly doesn't appear that the Iranians and the Russians are preparing any response of these strikes at the same time we still do have over two thousand US soldiers inside Syria they are very close to Russian forces and Iranian forces we have already seen instances in which they have brushed up against each other I worry that there are still plenty of other instances in the future where we could have conflict between US forces Iranian and Russian forces setting off a broader engagement and so we do have to have a conversation about what their mission is once the fight against ISIL has wound down senator Murphy the president just tweeted this morning confirming that his CIA director and Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo met with Kim jong-un in a preparation for these potential talks between Kim jong-un and president Trump what's your view of this meeting was this a positive step and do you trust that denuclearization is actually on the table well of course I don't know what the substance of the meetings were but I'm glad that there are there's some preparatory work happening for this potential summit between Trump and Kim jong-un I'm very worried that this summit is going to go very badly and then surrounded by Hawks like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo the president is going to be convinced that diplomacy has failed and the only option left is a military action I think we have to question whether the CIA hey is the appropriate in a locutor between the United States and the North Koreans that really should be the State Department but I think we should all admit that it's good not bad that the Trump administration is trying to do some work ahead of this meeting perhaps setting the stage for success rather than failure senator noah rothman with commentary magazine you said that essentially the american posture towards Bashar al-assad should be to establish his criminality and some sort of an international court transfer him to the hague what have you that's aspirational it's not something that we can pursue him immediately you said you are opposed to these strikes perhaps not in principle though because you believe that American interests are threatened by the use of chemical weapons on the battlefield and both the the two chemical attacks in foreign soil sponsored by states like Russia and North Korea that happened in the last 14 months so are you suggesting then that because Congress has the responsibility to authorize these strikes that you would withhold that authorization even though in principle you agree that American interests are threatened in Syria I would withhold that authorization because I don't believe that the strikes have any effect on the battlefield other than to put the Syrian people at greater risk listen we have to have a conversation about why we hold this special status for chemical weapons which are awful which do unbelievable horrific damage to people but we have let Bashar Assad off the hook when he is engaged in other murders activity against his own people the systemic rape of civilians barrel bombs so the idea that you know we can wash our hands of the atrocities that Bashar al-assad has committed simply because we launched one day of missile strikes after a chemical weapons attack misunderstands the fact that hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed inside Syria through means other than chemical weapons my suggestion is to engage in a process that ends this war as quickly as possible that may end up in the short term in Assad or his allies running the country but it will result in tens of thousands less Syrians being killed I get it that restraint is is is unsavory sometimes because it feels better to punch a bully in the mouth but if the bully just continues to run ravaged over the people around him even after the punch has been landed then I'm not sure what difference it makes and whether the moral universe has been square alright Senator
