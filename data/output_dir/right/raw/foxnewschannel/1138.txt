1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,579
Are those my shorts?

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:10,521
>> Shannon: AS WE ARE STILL

3
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:11,222
WATCHING RESULTS ROLL IN FROM

4
00:00:11,222 --> 00:00:12,223
CALIFORNIA, THE RACE IS STILL

5
00:00:12,223 --> 00:00:13,924
TOO CLOSE TO CALL FOR GOVERNOR.

6
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:16,026
LET'S HEAD BACK THERE NOW I TALK

7
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:17,728
TO JOHN COX OF A REPUBLICAN

8
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:19,296
CONTINENT GOVERNOR.

9
00:00:19,296 --> 00:00:21,565
HE'S HOPING TO MAKE IT INTO THE

10
00:00:21,565 --> 00:00:23,100
FALL.

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,702
THE JUNGLE PRIMARY IN

12
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:26,103
CALIFORNIA, THE TOP TWO,

13
00:00:26,103 --> 00:00:27,338
REGARDLESS OF PARTY, AND UP

14
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:28,139
THERE.

15
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:29,206
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN

16
00:00:29,206 --> 00:00:30,808
NEWSOM, AN EASY RUN OF THE TOP

17
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:31,142
SPOT.

18
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:32,910
BUT MR. COX, MAY BE THE NUMBER

19
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:33,177
TWO.

20
00:00:33,177 --> 00:00:35,846
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TONIGHT,

21
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:36,113
SIR?

22
00:00:36,113 --> 00:00:37,748
>> I'M DOING GREAT.

23
00:00:37,748 --> 00:00:39,116
I LIKE THE EARLY RETURNS AND I'M

24
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:40,384
EAGER TO GET INTO THE BATTLE.

25
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:42,920
>> Shannon: I WANT TO REDO

26
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,755
SOMETHING FROM THE "L.A. TIMES,"

27
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:46,323
"IN LEFT-LEANING CALIFORNIA,

28
00:00:46,323 --> 00:00:48,526
NEWSOM IS LIKELY TO BREEZE TO

29
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:49,660
VICTORY IN A NOVEMBER FACE-OFF

30
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,729
AGAINST COX, WHO HAS HITCHED HIS

31
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:53,430
CAMPAIGN TO THE FAR RIGHT

32
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,299
POLICIES OF THE TRUMP

33
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:55,766
ADMINISTRATION."

34
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:57,101
THEY MAKE IT SOUND LIKE YOU

35
00:00:57,101 --> 00:00:57,701
DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

36
00:00:57,701 --> 00:00:59,537
HOW DO YOU RESPOND?

37
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,539
>> THESE ARE THE SAME EXPERTS

38
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:02,540
WHO SAID THAT I WASN'T GOING TO

39
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,108
BE IN THE TOP TWO.

40
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:06,710
IT WAS GOING TO BE VILLARAIGOSA

41
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,113
AND NEWSOM AND THE TOP TWO.

42
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:09,880
THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT THAT AND

43
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,117
THEY ARE WRONG ABOUT THE EFFORTS

44
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:15,653
THAT WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IN

45
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:16,687
NOVEMBER.

46
00:01:16,687 --> 00:01:17,988
THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE HAVE

47
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:19,757
BEEN BEATEN INTO SUBMISSION BY

48
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:20,524
THE DEMOCRATS.

49
00:01:20,524 --> 00:01:22,326
THIS ESTATE IS THE NUMBER ONE

50
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:23,627
STATE OR PROPERTY, IT IS NOT IS

51
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:26,697
UNAFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE, IT

52
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:27,898
IS THE HIGHEST TAXED STATE IN

53
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:28,332
THE COUNTRY.

54
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,835
THE DEMOCRATS AND GAVIN NEWSOM

55
00:01:30,835 --> 00:01:32,136
HAVE MISMANAGED THE SCHOOLS,

56
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:34,138
MISMANAGED THE ROADS, THEY HAVE

57
00:01:34,138 --> 00:01:36,140
SPENT MONEY LIKE CRAZY, AND THEY

58
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,907
KEEP DIGGING THEIR HANDS INTO

59
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:39,543
PEOPLE'S POCKETS.

60
00:01:39,543 --> 00:01:41,612
GAVIN NEWSOM HAS SAID HIMSELF

61
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:42,813
HE'S GOING TO DOUBLE THE STATE

62
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:45,382
INCOME TAX, HE IS GOING TO RAISE

63
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:46,350
PROPERTY TAX, AND HE'S GOING TO

64
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,486
FIGHT TO REPEAL THE GAS TAX.

65
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,121
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS

66
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,524
ESTATE HAVE BEEN TAXED ENOUGH.

67
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:55,292
THEY KNOW THE STATE IS

68
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:56,093
UNAFFORDABLE, SHANNON.

69
00:01:56,093 --> 00:01:58,062
THEY WANT A CHANGE, THEY WANT TO

70
00:01:58,062 --> 00:02:00,130
HAVE A STATE WHERE THEY CAN

71
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,099
ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY FOR THEIR

72
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:03,534
RETIREMENT OR FOR THEIR KIDS

73
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:03,934
EDUCATION.

74
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:06,170
RIGHT NOW, THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE

75
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,503
TO THEM.

76
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:07,738
>> Shannon: WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

77
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:08,372
THIS BEFORE.

78
00:02:08,372 --> 00:02:09,573
THE POLLING SHOWS WHERE THEY ARE

79
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:10,941
ON A SHEET OF SANCTUARY CITIES

80
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,376
AND TAXES AND ALL KINDS OF

81
00:02:12,376 --> 00:02:13,744
THINGS THEY DON'T LIKE, AND YET

82
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,379
THEY KEEP VOTING FOR THE

83
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:15,746
DEMOCRATS.

84
00:02:15,746 --> 00:02:17,748
HOW DO YOU UNDO THAT

85
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:18,382
FORMULATION?

86
00:02:18,382 --> 00:02:21,118
IT SEEMS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

87
00:02:21,118 --> 00:02:22,319
A LOCK ON THE STATE THERE.

88
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,688
DESPITE THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE

89
00:02:24,688 --> 00:02:25,322
UNHAPPY ABOUT THE POLICY

90
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,925
DECISIONS THEY MAKE.

91
00:02:27,925 --> 00:02:29,493
>> THEY HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

92
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,528
VOTE ON AN ALTERNATIVE YET,

93
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:32,329
SHANNON.

94
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:34,131
I'M A BUSINESSMAN.

95
00:02:34,131 --> 00:02:35,733
I'VE GOTTEN RESULTS OVER 40

96
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:36,233
YEARS IN BUSINESS.

97
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:40,070
I'VE HAD A MEEK BUDGET.

98
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,172
GAVIN NEWSOM LEFT SAN FRANCISCO

99
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:44,141
WITH AN UNBELIEVABLE UNFUNDED

100
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,143
PENSION DEBT, HOMELESS PEOPLE IN

101
00:02:46,143 --> 00:02:49,947
THE STREETS, TREMENDOUS HOUSING

102
00:02:49,947 --> 00:02:51,315
PRICES THAT PRICE EVERYBODY OUT

103
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:53,951
OF THE MARKET, 46% OF PEOPLE IN

104
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:56,320
THE BAY AREA SAID THEY WANTED TO

105
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,720
LEAVE.

106
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,188
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK GAVIN

107
00:02:58,188 --> 00:03:00,791
NEWSOM DESERVES A PROMOTION, AND

108
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,093
I THINK THE PEOPLE OF THIS

109
00:03:03,093 --> 00:03:04,528
STATE, GIVEN THE ALTERNATIVE OF

110
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:06,063
SOMEBODY LIKE ME, WHO'S ACTUALLY

111
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:07,698
GOING TO DELIVER RESULTS FOR

112
00:03:07,698 --> 00:03:08,832
THEM, I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO

113
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:12,603
VOTE FOR ME AND THEY WILL CHANGE

114
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:13,737
>> Shannon: I WANT TO READ

115
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:15,906
SOMETHING ELSE COMING IN FROM

116
00:03:15,906 --> 00:03:16,540
ROLLING STONE.

117
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,109
"IF COX MAKES HIS WAY UP TO THE

118
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:19,777
BALLOT, IT WILL INCENTIVIZE

119

CONSERVATIVES TO HEAD TO THE

120
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:22,346

124
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,651
THOSE CONSERVATIVES WILL VOTE

FOR REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL

126
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,287
CANDIDATES, WHICH WOULD MAKE IT

127
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:31,555
MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE DEMOCRATS

128
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:32,957
TO ENACT THE SEATS THEY NEED TO

129
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,959
TURN THE HOUSE BLEW."

130
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,794
HOW CRITICAL OUTSIDE OF THE

131
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:37,995
GOVERNOR'S RACE IS IT FOR YOU TO

132
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:39,463
MAKE IT ONTO THE BALLOT BECAUSE

133
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:40,731
OF THE OTHER CRITICAL HOUSE

134

RACES OUT THERE?

135
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,301
>> I THINK IT IS CRITICAL TO

136
00:03:44,301 --> 00:03:45,703
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A BETTER

AGENDA IN WASHINGTON.

138
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:50,307
WE'VE GOT TO REPEAL AND REPLACE

139
00:03:50,307 --> 00:03:52,076
OBAMACARE, WE'VE GOT TO BUILD

140
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:52,810
INFRASTRUCTURE, THAT MEANS WE

141
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,712
HAVE TO HOLD THE HOUSE, GOT TO

142
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:55,813
CUT THE MASSIVE SPENDING, GOT TO

143
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:58,816
DEAL WITH A $21 TRILLION DEBT.

144
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:00,351
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO

145
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:01,852
THAT IS BY GROWING THE ECONOMY.

146
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,355
THAT IS WHAT I PLANNED TO DO IN

147
00:04:04,355 --> 00:04:05,089
CALIFORNIA, SHANNON.

148
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:07,891
WE'VE GOT A $1 TRILLION UNFUNDED

149
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:08,325
PENSION DEBT.

150
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,694
WE'VE GOT TO GROW THIS ECONOMY.

151
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:13,097
WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT

152
00:04:13,097 --> 00:04:14,531
BUSINESSES STOP LEAVING THIS

153
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:15,699
STATE.

154
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,500
WE'VE LOST 9,000 BUSINESSES IN

155
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,902
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS.

156
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,971
I AM A SMALL BUSINESSMAN.

157
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,272
I TALK TO BUSINESS PEOPLE ALL

158
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:23,374
ACROSS THE STATE, AND THEY TELL

159
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,508
ME THAT THEY WOULD MOVE THEIR

160
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:26,110
BUSINESS IF THEY COULD.

161
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,910
BUT THEY CAN'T.

162
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,345
YOU KNOW WHAT?

163
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:30,714
I THINK THEY WILL LATCH ONTO MY

164
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:31,081
CAMPAIGN.

165
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,317
THEY WILL SAY, THIS IS OUR LAST

166
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:34,318
CHANCE TO TURN AROUND THIS

167
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:35,753
ESTATE BEFORE THE DEMOCRATS AND

168
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:36,653
GAVIN NEWSOM RUIN EDGE.

169
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:39,890
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE MORE THING,

170
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,891
SHANNON.

171
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,426
19 STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY

172
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:43,961
HAVE BUSINESSMEN AS GOVERNORS.

173
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,297
INCLUDING BLUE STATES, LIKE

174
00:04:47,297 --> 00:04:47,898
MARYLAND, MICHIGAN,

175
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:49,099
MASSACHUSETTS.

176
00:04:49,099 --> 00:00:00,000
THOSE GOVERNORS GET RESULTS.
