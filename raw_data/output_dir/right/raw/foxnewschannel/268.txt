00:00:06,793 --> 00:00:08,794
GOOD MORNING.

5
00:00:08,795 --> 00:00:10,562
RUDY GIULIANI CONFIRMING TO

6
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:11,363
FOX NEWS THAT THE DEPUTY

7
00:00:11,364 --> 00:00:12,831
ATTORNEY GENERAL TOLD THE

8
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:13,498
PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ABOUT

9
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:15,701
SECRETLY RECORDING THE PRESIDENT

10
00:00:15,702 --> 00:00:18,003
AFTER FIRING JAMES COMEY LAST

11
00:00:18,004 --> 00:00:19,371
YEAR WAS SARCASTIC.

12
00:00:19,372 --> 00:00:21,773
HE ALSO SAID THE PRESIDENT DID

13
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:22,474
NOT BELIEVE THAT THE DEPUTY

14
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:24,543
ATTORNEY GENERAL INVOKING THE

15
00:00:24,544 --> 00:00:25,244
25TH AMENDMENT TO REMOVE HIM

16
00:00:25,245 --> 00:00:27,346
FROM OFFICE.

17
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:31,049
RUDY GIULIANI NOTED THAT JEFF

18
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,950
SESSIONS MONDAY THIS WEEK,

19
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:38,457
ROSENSTEIN WENT THERE IN -- HE

20
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:40,392
PHONED INTO "FOX AND FRIENDS"

21
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:42,461
AND QUESTION WHY HE DID NOT GO

22
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:43,195
TO THE HEALTH TO TELL HIS SIDE

23
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:48,767
OF THE STORY.

24
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:49,434
>> I WAS SURPRISED AT THAT.

25
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:50,102
I WOULD THINK THAT HE WOULD.

26
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:52,170
HE MENTIONED CERTAIN THINGS TO

27
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:54,539
ME THAT ARE VERY POSITIVE ABOUT

28
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,774
THAT EVENT, AND I WOULD IMAGINE

29
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:57,376
THAT HE WOULD WANT TO PUT THAT

30
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:57,809
ON.

31
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:58,510
FRANKLY, WHETHER YOU ARE UNDER

32
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:01,280
OATH OR NOT, BUT HE SAID SOME

33
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:02,781
THINGS TO ME THAT I WOULD THINK

34
00:01:02,782 --> 00:01:06,318
WOULD BE FUN FOR HIM TO TESTIFY.

35
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:08,820
SO I AM A LITTLE SURPRISED THAT

36
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:14,960
HE WOULDN'T DO IT.

37
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:20,399
>> HE WORKED UNDER DIRECTOR

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,800
COMEY, HE BELIEVES THAT HE SAID

39
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,802
HE THOUGHT THAT THE COMMENTS

40
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:25,170
WERE SERIOUS.

41
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,004
ANOTHER WITNESS THAT IS AT ODDS

42
00:01:26,005 --> 00:01:26,705
WITH THE DEPUTY

43
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:29,374
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACCOUNT.

44
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:30,976
THE SESSION TODAY, THERE WAS

45
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:33,578
REALLY AN IMPACT, SOME LAWMAKERS

46
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:34,980
PUSHING FOR A TRANSCRIBED

47
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:36,748
INTERVIEW UNDER OATH BECAUSE THE

48
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:37,482
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST ROSENSTEIN

49
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:39,751
ARE SO SERIOUS.

50
00:01:39,752 --> 00:00:00,000
A BRIEFING OR MORE INFORMAL
