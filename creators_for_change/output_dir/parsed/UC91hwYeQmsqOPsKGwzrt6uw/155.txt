congratulations because at any moment
now you'll be a father
the love of your life is going through
extraordinary pain what is your
responsibility what does a man fit in to
a birth story while you you get to
witness a miracle pay attention pay
attention to what she needs
watch our focus watch her control
breaths realize what she sacrificed her
and that she's doing it all for love
find your own way to cheer her on
but above all else be present
Oh feels so good you guys
and see the strength of not only her
body but her mind understand that
there's nothing you can do to help
sometimes you just need someone there
just so she doesn't feel alone this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this is
not just her experience this is yours as
well I believe this is something which
is supposed to see to my mind this
you're not really as strong as you think
you are and sometimes your wife is too
superhero and you're just a sidekick
and that's okay because from this moment
on you have the opportunity to work as
hard as she's working right now for love
