1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,179
I think he might win because first of

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">all he's demonstrated he could get the</font>

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,920
nomination but secondly all we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,710
have happen is some unexpected event

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,279
between today and the election<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,470
november eight we could have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrible</font>

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,600
terrorist attack perhaps one

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,720
orchestrated secretly by the man he

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,630
keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> worshiping publicly of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Vladimir</font>

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Putin we could have something happen to</font>

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other candidate there are all sorts</font>

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,219
of possibilities here secondly I don't

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,520
trust the polls this year in many<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,399
this is an election about are you a

15
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,410
racist and I think there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who don't think they're racists</font>

17
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,640
but they absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very unhappy</font>

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,739
that we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black president and the</font>

19
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,899
prospect of a woman president disturbs

20
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,520
them deeply and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

21
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're honestly reporting their</font>

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,320
feelings and conduct the pollsters and

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,329
I've talked to some pollsters who when I

24
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:04,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked them about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it get a little</font>

25
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,740
squeamish about those questions what's

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,110
the biggest reason Donald Trump may lose

27
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,180
this election the demographics of this

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,220
country don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor Donald Trump and</font>

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,960
they don't favor a Republican president

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,020
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> current Republican policies and by</font>

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,939
the way I'm a registered Republican of

32
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,070
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years standing the country's</font>

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,130
demographics are becoming more diverse

34
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,869
but many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the Republican Party</font>

35
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,570
particularly those most drawn to Donald

36
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,750
Trump want to have a white America<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

37
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,150
certainly a dominant white cultured

38
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,520
America the numbers for that just don't

39
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,650
work Trump is almost certain to win

40
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,500
states in the old south but everywhere

41
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,720
else in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country he faces</font>

42
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,399
demographics that are not at all

43
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,399
comfortable for him and for his brand of

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:00:00,000
racism and xenophobia
