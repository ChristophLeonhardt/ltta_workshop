00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,259
>>WE HAVE A STORY OF THE
ROUTINE ABUSE OF UNDOCUMENTED

2
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,759
IMMIGRANTS IN FLORIDA BY THEIR
EMPLOYERS THAT WILL PROBABLY

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,230
MAKE YOUR BLOOD BOIL, AND IT'S
HAPPENING AT A MASS SCALE.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,230
THIS

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,689
INFORMATION COMES AS THE RESULT
OF A YEAR-LONG INVESTIGATION BY

6
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:20,250
THE NAPLES DAILY NEWS, AND FIRST
HERE'S A CASE STUDY IN HOW THIS

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,250
FUNCTIONS --

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:46,600
>>SO WHEN YOU GET INJURED ON
THE JOB, AS HAPPENS, BECAUSE

9
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,110
MANY JOBS, INCLUDING
CONSTRUCTION JOBS, ARE

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,260
DANGEROUS, THEY WILL IN CAST YOU
OFF.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,640
IF YOU THEN TRY TO GET HELP

12
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,570
FROM EFFECTIVELY THE GOVERNMENT,
WHICH STILL INVOLVES YOUR

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,710
EMPLOYER, THEY WILL ATTEMPT TO
GET YOU DEPORTED.

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,710
IT'S DAMNED IF

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,140
YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU DON'T. NOW
--

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:17,340
>>NOT ALLEGEDLY, THEY DO THAT.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,909
>>LET'S TALK ABOUT THE NUMBERS,
YOU HAVE THE CASE STUDY, HOW

18
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,479
MANY CASES ARE THERE?

19
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,479
WELL --

20
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:42,500
>>I WONDER WHO IS TURNING THEM
IN, I CAN'T QUITE TELL.

21
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,430
>>OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE BREAKING
THE LAW BY PROVIDING FALSE

22
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,450
INFORMATION BUT THERE IS
SUPPOSED TO BE A LEGAL

23
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,450
REQUIREMENT FOR THE EMPLOYER TO
VERIFY.

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,579
THEY ARE WILLINGLY

25
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,659
CLOSING THEIR EYES AND HIRING
PEOPLE KNOWING THAT THEY HAVE

26
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,869
THEN BOUGHT THEMSELVES NOT
REALLY ANY LEGAL LIABILITY BUT

27
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,770
JUST A LEGAL OUT WHERE THEY GET
THE PERSON DEPORTED AND DON'T

28
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,899
HAVE TO PAY.

29
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,360
UNDERSTAND THEY ARE
SUPPOSED TO FIND OUT FOR SURE

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,770
THAT YOU ARE LEGAL, BUT --

31
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:21,920
>>SO THEY ARE DOING THIS, BUT
THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY FACING ANY

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,910
LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS FOR THEIR
ACTIONS.

33
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,910
ALSO --

34
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:32,370
>>CLEARLY THEY AREN'T ABIDING BY
THAT LAW EITHER.

35
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,600
>>LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THE
GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS WORKS IN

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,420
CAHOOTS TO SCREW OVER WORKERS
YET AGAIN.

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,580
THERE ARE NO

38
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,240
PROSECUTIONS OF THINGS THAT ARE
CLEARLY GOING ON, WHICH IS

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,890
HIRING WORKERS YOU AREN'T
SUPPOSED TO BE HIRING.

40
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,890
IF YOU

41
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,290
ARE A RIGHT-WINGER AND YOU DON'T
LIKE UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS

42
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,910
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND
GETTING THESE JOBS, YOU SHOULD

43
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,030
BE FURIOUS AT THOSE BUSINESSES.

44
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,030
THAT'S THE MAIN THING YOU TALK

45
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,540
ABOUT, OH MY GOD, THEY ARE
TAKING MY JOBS.

46
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,540
THE GUYS WHO ARE

47
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,720
HIRING THEM INSTEAD OF YOU ARE
DOING THIS, SO YOU SHOULD BE

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,410
FURIOUS AT THOSE BUSINESSES.

49
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,970
SECONDARILY, THE GOVERNMENT

50
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,390
KNOWS IT AND THEY DON'T CARE,
THEY AREN'T DOING ANYTHING ABOUT

51
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,900
IT, YOU SHOULD BE FURIOUS ABOUT
THAT.

52
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,840
AND IF YOU THINK, OBAMA --

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,810
IT'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENTS.

54
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,410
FLORIDA IS RUN BY REPUBLICANS

55
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,610
FOR HOW MANY YEARS NOW?

56
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,240
THEY
PURPOSELY AREN'T ENFORCING IT

57
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,820
BECAUSE THEY GET PAID OFF BY THE
BUSINESS INTERESTS.

58
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,250
IF YOU ARE A

59
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,299
REPUBLICAN, GOVERNMENT IS
CORRUPT, I HEAR YOU, BROTHER.

60
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,540
WHO DO YOU THINK CORRUPTED THEM?

61
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,250
BUSINESSES LIKE THIS.

62
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,250
THEN THEY

63
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:45,070
TURN AROUND AND THEY GO, I GUESS
YOU ARE HIRING ALL LEGAL

64
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,070
WORKERS.

65
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:50,600
OH YES WE ARE. AND OF
COURSE THEY TURN AROUND, YOU GOT

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,060
INJURED AND I WILL HAVE TO PAY
YOU SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU ALMOST

67
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,100
CUT YOUR FINGER OFF?

68
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,010
AND INSTEAD
OF BEING A HUMAN BEING AND

69
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:02,290
CARING ABOUT YOU, SOMEONE I WORK
WITH EVERY DAY, I WILL RUIN YOUR

70
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,630
LIFE AND SAY YOU DEAL WITH YOUR
AMPUTATED FINGER OR WHATEVER IT

71
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,620
IS, HEART ATTACK, ALL THE CASES
ARE DIFFERENT INJURIES, I DON'T

72
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,900
CARE, AND FACT I WILL RUIN YOUR
LIFE.

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,149
GOLLY GEE, I JUST FOUND

74
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,018
OUT HE'S UNDOCUMENTED, I HAVE TO
TURN HIM IN.

75
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,689
>>IT TOOK AN INJURY TO PAY
ATTENTION.

76
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:25,199
>>AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT

77
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,650
GOES, YOU ARE RIGHT,
THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT.

78
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,840
AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU
ARE REPORTING ALL THESE CASES OF

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,080
A DOCUMENT WORKERS I WON'T
INVESTIGATE THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE

80
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,710
ON STAFF RIGHT NOW.

81
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,949
I WILL ONLY
ENFORCE IT AGAINST THE PEOPLE

82
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,979
YOU TOLD ME TO FIRE BECAUSE
THEY ARE COSTING YOU MONEY.

83
00:04:42,979 --> 00:00:00,000
NOT FIRE BUT LITERALLY RUN OUT
OF THE COUNTRY.
