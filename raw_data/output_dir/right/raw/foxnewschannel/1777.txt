1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,169
GAZA BORDER WITH MORE FROM

2
00:00:03,302 --> 00:00:06,339
WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR TODAY?

3
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,241
>> WHAT A CONTRAST FROM

4
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:08,941
JERUSALEM OUT THERE.

5
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:10,810
THE GRAND CELEBRATION OF THE

6
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,313
NEW U.S. EMBASSY AND NEAR 90

7
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:15,982
MINUTES SOUTH THERE ARE HEAVY

8
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:19,085
CLASHES AND WE'VE HEARD

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,253
EXTENSIVE GUNFIRE AND BOMBING

10
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:20,720
INSIDE GAZA.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,888
IF YOU LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER

12
00:00:21,888 --> 00:00:23,523
THERE ARE SOME OF THE TENS OF

13
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,391
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE

14
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:26,692
GATHERED UP AND DOWN THIS

15
00:00:26,692 --> 00:00:27,026
BORDER.

16
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,996
WE HAVE ALSO HEARD FROM THE IDF

17
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,932
NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TRYING TO

18
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,100
BREACH THE FENCE, COORDINATED

19
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,636
ATTEMPTS BY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.

20
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:38,504
THEY HAVE RESPONDED TO PROTECT

21
00:00:38,504 --> 00:00:39,906
ISRAEL AND SAYING THEY HAVE

22
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:41,774
BOMBED TUNNELS THAT THEY'VE

23
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:43,509
FOUND AND THAT IF IT

24
00:00:43,509 --> 00:00:45,378
INTENSIFIED THEY WOULD ALSO

25
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,345
BOMB INSIDE GAZA.

26
00:00:46,345 --> 00:00:48,180
WE'VE JUST HAD CONFIRMATION

27
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,416
THEY HAVE INDEED STRUCK A HAMAS

28
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:50,716
CAMP.

29
00:00:50,716 --> 00:00:52,885
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A

30
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:53,352
SIX-WEEK MARCH.

31
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:55,087
IN FACT, TOMORROW IS THE LAST

32
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:56,956
DAY OF THE MARCH.

33
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,524
BUT TODAY IN RECOGNITION OF

34
00:00:58,524 --> 00:00:59,625
THAT JERUSALEM OPENING THEY

35
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,028
HAVE DECIDED TO GO IN A BIG WAY.

36
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,596
ALSO THE MOST DEADLY DAY WE'VE

37
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:05,298
SEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE

38
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:05,665
SIX WEEKS.

39
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,933
41 KILLED SO FAR.

40
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,601
WE EXPECT THAT NUMBER TO RISE

41
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,570
PERHAPS AND IT'S ALSO THE MOST

42
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,805
DEADLY DAY SINCE 2014.

43
00:01:12,805 --> 00:01:13,973
THE HAMAS LEADER HAD SAID --

44
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,641
HAD CALLED ON PEOPLE THE TRY TO

45
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:17,009
CROSS THE FENCE SAYING THEY

46
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:18,244
WOULD BE UNARMED AND PEACEFUL

47
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,280
BUT SAID THEY WOULD BE LIKE A

48
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,747
STARVING TIGER.

49
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:22,715
SO VERY, VERY TENSE SITUATION

50
00:01:22,715 --> 00:00:00,000
ON THE BORDER AT THE MOMENT.
