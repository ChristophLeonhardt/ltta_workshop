one here at the Baikonur cosmodrome is counting down the final seconds before takeoff the crew got to the platform about two hours ago and are now doing their final checks and actually it sounds like liftoff is already about to take place let's watch for a second there's the tell-tale sounds of the engine going off and we can finally see liftoff I have to say even from this distance you can really feel the power of engines what we just saw there was the first stage boosters roaring into action and burning on a couple hundred tons of fuel they will fall away shortly if they haven't already making way for the second and third stage booster to take over now just a few hours before launch we had a chance to see the crew up close and they all seemed to be in high spirits and now finally after a long wait and much anticipation doctor Sarina an enchanter said Ageha Procopio and Alexander Gerst are all making their way to the International Space Station for their six-month stay now it takes less than 10 minutes for them to reach Earth's orbit will they'll be for the next two days before they dock with the station on Friday now of course once they get there they'll get straight to work conducting hundreds of experiments on the world's first and only zero-gravity lab
