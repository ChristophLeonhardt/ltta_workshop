I SHARE THE ANGER AND 

71
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,210
FRUSTRATION THAT MANY ARE

73
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,647
BECAUSE OF ANYTHING, THIS 

74
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,015

75
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,483
CONTINUING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE 

76
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,317
WITH ILLEGAL GUNS AND OFFENDERS 

77
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,553
ON THE STREET THAT ARE WILLING 

78
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:36,856
TO USE THEM. 

79
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,825
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 

80
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,459

THOSE AREAS. 

84
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,270
IN FACT, 46 PEOPLE WERE 

85
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,637
ARRESTED FOR GUN CHARGES THIS 

86
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,305

THIS YEAR. 

91
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,347
IS BECAUSE OF THE HARD WORK OF 

92
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:05,685
THE OFFICERS IN THE CPD THAT WE 

93
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:06,853

94
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,521

97
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,295
ON TOP THAT, OFFICERS WILL 

98
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:20,266
CONTINUE TO PATROL THESE OFFERS 

99
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:20,867
-- AREAS. 

100
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,804
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO PROTECT

101
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:25,304
POTENTIAL HOTSPOTS. 

102
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:27,106
ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE PLANNING 

103
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:31,144
FUTURE MOTIONS MISSIONS TO 

104
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,045
FOCUS ON THE VIOLENCE. 

105
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,280
THE TRUTH IS, AND MAYBE YOU'RE 

106
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,481
TIRED OF HEARING ME SAY THAT, 

107
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:45,325
AS LONG AS WE FAIL TO KEEP THEM 

108
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,059
ACCOUNTABLE, WE ARE GOING TO 

109
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,627
KEEP HAVING THESE DISCUSSIONS 

110
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,095
ON MONDAY MORNINGS. 

111
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,131
THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH OF IT. 

112
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:53,466
IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE 

113
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,134
PULLING THE TRIGGERS IN SOME OF 

114
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,603
THESE COMMUNITIES. 

115
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,905
THIS ISN'T A WIDESPREAD ISSUE 

116
00:03:58,905 --> 00:03:59,372
AMONG THE CITIZENS. 

117
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,174
THIS IS A SMALL SUBSET OF 

118
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:04,143
INDIVIDUALS WHO THINK THEY CAN 

119
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,580
PLAY BY THEIR OWN RULES BECAUSE 

120
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,315
THEY CONTINUE TO GET A SLAP ON 

121
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,983
THE WRIST WHEN WE ARREST THEM. 

122
00:04:10,983 --> 00:04:14,387
DISLIKED -- DESPITE THE 

123
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,355
LEGISLATION WE PASSED, THESE 

124
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,123
INDIVIDUALS STILL INSIST ON 

125
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:19,192
DOING JUST THAT. 

126
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,394
I'M TIRED OF IT. 

127
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,628
EVERYBODY IN THE CITY SHOULD BE 

128
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,229
TIRED OF IT. 

129
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,564
THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT 

130
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:27,834
CANNOT DO THIS ALONE. 

131
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:30,103
MARY MANUAL HAS MADE 

132
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,138
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN 

133
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,308
MENTORING YOU THINK READING 

134
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:36,242
OPPORTUNITIES IN SOME OF THE 

135
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,043
MOST CHALLENGED NEIGHBORHOODS. 

136
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:41,414
WE NEED EVERYONE ESPECIALLY THE 

137
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:42,682
JUDICIAL PARTNERS TO START 

138
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,652
MAKING REPEAT OFFENDERS FEEL 

139
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,653
THE REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THEIR 

140
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:53,292
ACTIONS. WE NEED THE GOVERNOR TO

141
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:55,495
SIGN A BILL TO MAKE IT MORE 

142
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,497
DIFFICULT FOR OFFENDERS TO 

143
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,765
OBTAIN WEAPONS. 

144
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,601
WE NEED COMMUNITY LEVELS -- 

145
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,935
LEADERS TO WORK WITH US. 

146
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:04,837
WE NEED PARENTS TO BE PARENTS. 

147
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:07,306
WE NEED NEIGHBORHOODS TO BE 

148
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,608
NEIGHBORHOODS. 

149
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:09,542
YOU KNOW WHO THESE INDIVIDUALS 

150
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:09,809
ARE. 

151
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,243
THEY COME TO YOUR HOME'S 

152
00:05:11,243 --> 00:05:14,781
EVERYDAY, THEY SLEEP WITH YOU 

153
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:16,916
EVERY DAY. 

154
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:17,883
GRANDPARENTS, PARENTS, SIBLINGS

155
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:19,886
, SIGNIFICANT OTHERS. 

156
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:22,955
YOU KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 

157
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,291
WE ALSO NEED THOSE INVOLVED 

158
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,592
WITH THE COMMITTEE TO MENTOR 

159
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,126
THE USE. 

160
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:31,164
WE HAVE WORKED HARD AND 

161
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,598
INVESTED COUNTLESS MAN HOURS 

162
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:33,666
AND RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY 

163
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,334
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CAUSING 

164
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:37,170
THE VIOLENCE IN CERTAIN PARTS 

165
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,172
OF THE CITY. 

166
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,474
THESE SHOOTINGS ARE NOT RANDOM. 

167
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,877
THEY ARE FUELED BY GANG 

168
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:45,177
CONFLICTS. 

169
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,112
WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. 

170
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,413
AND WE CONTINUE TO SEND A 

171
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,415
MESSAGE THAT IT IS OKAY TO 

172
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,084
COMMIT THESE CRIMES BY NOT 

173
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:54,420
DOING ANYTHING AS A COMMUNITY. 

174
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,622
WE ARE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE ON 

175
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,291
THE SAME SIDE. 

176
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,627
CPD CAN BE BETTER. 

177
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:04,697
BUT THE CITY CAN BE BETTER. 

178
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,398
ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT I 

179
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,432
MENTIONED BEFORE, THEY NEED TO 

180
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,601
WORK TOGETHER AGAINST THE 

181
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,236
VIOLENCE SO THAT THE COMMUNITY 

182
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,771
CAN REBUILD. 

183
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,339
AND DESPITE WHAT WE SAW THIS 

184
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,607
WEEKEND, I'M STILL PLEASED 

185
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,610
BETWEEN CPD'S WORK, THE MAYOR'S 

186
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,047
INVESTMENTS IN THE WORK OF THE 

187
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,615
COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT WE ARE 

188
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,384
STILL REDUCING OVERALL GUN 

189
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:24,917
VIOLENCE THIS YEAR. 

190
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,319
BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT MORE 

191
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,720
WORK TO DO. 

192
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,789
I THINK THAT WAS EVIDENT BY 

193
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,090
THIS WEEKEND. 

194
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:32,824
WE NEED EVERYONE TO COME TO THE 

195
00:06:32,824 --> 00:06:36,028
TABLE WITH LESS TALK AND MORE 

196
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:36,261
ACTION. 

197
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,030
AND NOW I LIKE TO ASK MAYOR 

198
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,067
EMANUEL  TO COME UP AND SHARE 

199
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,502
SOME THOUGHTS. 

200
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:46,238
>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK 

201
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,239
THE COMMANDER, THE 

202
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:57,316
SUPERINTENDENT -- THIS MORNING, 

203
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:58,518
I SPOKE AT A GRADUATION OF 

204
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,053
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN. THEIR 

205
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:05,124
PARENTS WERE THERE. 

206
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:11,197
AND I TOLD THEM THEN AS I TOLD 

207
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,932
THEM ABOUT TAKING A TRAIN IN 

208
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,267
WITH MY DAUGHTER AS SHE WENT TO 

209
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,970
HER SUMMER JOB. 

210
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,571
THESE ARE YOUNG KIDS FROM HIGH 

211
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:23,809
SCHOOLS. 

212
00:07:23,809 --> 00:07:28,481
AND I SAID TO THE PARENTS, IN 

213
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:34,386
THE JEWISH FAITH, WHEN YOU GET 

214
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:42,895
MARRIED YOU BREAK THE GLASS. 

215
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:48,935
AND THE REASON IS TO REMIND US 

216
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,003
THAT IN A MOMENT OF JOY AND 

217
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,072
HAPPINESS AND CELEBRATION OF 

218
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:57,310
LIFE THAT LIFE IS FRAGILE. 

219
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,446
AND I ASKED THE PARENTS IN THE 

220
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:02,148
SAME WAY THAT I SAID GOODBYE TO 

221
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,352
MY DAUGHTER ON THE TRAIN, AND 

222
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,286
THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR 

223
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,387
CHILDREN CELEBRATING THIS 

224
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,723
MILESTONE, TO HUG THEM. 

225
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,225
TO TELL THEM THAT THEY LOVE 

226
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:15,261
THEM. 

227
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,428
BECAUSE I WAS LEAVING THE 

228
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:19,699
GRADUATION I WAS GOING TO MOUNT 

229
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:32,077
SINAI AND STERGER HOSPITAL TO 

230
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,647
HUG THE DOCTORS AND NURSES, AND 

231
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:38,417
MEDICAL TEAMS WHILE THEY ACTED 

232
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,388
PROFESSIONALLY THEY TOO HAVE A 

233
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:47,293
SOUL. 

234
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:48,728
AND LET THEM KNOW HOW MUCH I 

235
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,196
APPRECIATED WHAT THEY DID THIS 

236
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:55,201
WEEKEND. 

237
00:08:55,201 --> 00:09:03,342
LOOK, WE HAVE A HEAVY HEART. 

238
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,380
OUR CELLS ARE BURDENED. 

239
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,314
WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEKEND DID 

240
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:09,315
NOT HAPPEN IN EVERY 

241
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,883
NEIGHBORHOOD IN CHICAGO BUT IT 

242
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,786
IS UNACCEPTABLE TO HAPPEN IN ANY

243
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:15,688
A HOOD IN CHICAGO. 

244
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:19,892
WE ARE A BETTER CITY. 

245
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,327
I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF THE CITY. 

246
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:26,699
OF EVERY WALK OF LIFE. I HAVE 

247
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,200
BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH THE 

248
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,968
MOTHER TODAY. 

249
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,737
TWO OF THEM. 

250
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,807
THEY HAVE THE SAME ASPIRATIONS, 

251
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,043
SAME DESIRES THAT I DO FOR MY 

252
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:41,013
CHILDREN THAT YOU DO. AND 

253
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:48,621
SOMEBODY ON A BIKE TAKES THE 

254
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,793
CHILD FROM THAT PARENT. THIS IS 

255
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,227
NOT ABOUT THE CHICAGO POLICE 

256
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,962
DEPARTMENT, ALONE. 

257
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:58,931
IT'S NOT ABOUT A SUMMER JOB 

258
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,968
PROGRAM ALONE. 

259
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,469
THIS IS ABOUT THE FABRIC OF A 

260
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:08,140
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY, AS 

261
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,777
THE SUPERINTENDENT SHE SAID, 

262
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,912
WHO KNOWS WHO DID THIS. 

263
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:14,413
IF YOU SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, WE 

264
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:15,681
MUST COME FORWARD AS A 

265
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:22,955
NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE AMORAL 

266
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,225
CENTER OF GRAVITY HOLDS. 

267
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:31,196
I SOUGHT -- SAW IT ON WEDNESDAY 

268
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,065
NIGHT. 

269
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,533
POLICE, LEADERS, PEOPLE FROM 

270
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,668
ALL PARTS OF THE CITY WALKING 

271
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:47,947
TOGETHER. YOU CAN TALK ABOUT 

272
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,382
THE WEATHER. 

273
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:51,984
BUT THE WEATHER DID NOT PULL 

274
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,454
THE TRIGGER. 

275
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,456
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT JOBS AND 

276
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:00,960
THEY COUNT BUT IN PARTS OF THE 

277
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,596
CITY WERE THERE ARE NOT JOBS, 

278
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,697
PEOPLE DID NOT PULL THE 

279
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:04,963
TRIGGER. 

280
00:11:04,963 --> 00:11:07,733
THERE ARE VALLEYS, THERE ARE 

281
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,868
TOO MANY GUNS ON THE STREET, 

282
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,803
TOO MANY PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL 

283
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:16,242
RECORDS ON THE STREET AND THERE 

284
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:20,813
IS A SHORTAGE OF VALUES ABOUT 

285
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,348
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS 

286
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:22,581
WRONG. 

287
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,817
ABOUT WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE AND 

288
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:26,552
CONDONED WHAT IS CONDEMNED. 

289
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:30,256
AND WE AS A CITY IN EVERY CORNER

290
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,460
HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY AND 

291
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,827
RESPONSIBILITY. 

292
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,695
IF YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS, BE A 

293
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,463
NEIGHBOR. 

294
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,332
SPEAK UP. 

295
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,868
NEIGHBORS COME TOGETHER. 

296
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,837
THE CITY WILL BE WITH YOU 

297
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,339
SHOULDER TO SHOULDER. 

298
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,576
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY 

299
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:52,478
PEOPLE AND WHERE WERE THEY. 

300
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,014
THE SUPERINTENDENT WILL TAKE 

301
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,716
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT. 

302
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,884
THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOW MANY 

303
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,853
SEVERED JOBS -- SUMMER JOBS. 

304
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:02,588
WE'LL DO THAT. 

305
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:03,823
WE WILL DO THAT. 

306
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,624
WE HAVE MORE TO DO. 

307
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,192
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING MORE AT 

308
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:11,630
STAKE. 

309
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:19,271
AND ALL OF US KNOW THIS IS NOT 

310
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,108
CHICAGO. 

311
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:23,209
THEREFORE, ALL OF US WHO LOVE 

312
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,212
THE CITY AND CALL IT HOME HAVE 

313
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:31,549
A RESPONSIBILITY TO HEAL THE 

314
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:32,952
NEIGHBORHOODS. 

315
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:39,725
TO HOLD THE MOTHER OR A FATHER 

316
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:43,829
OR A GRANDMOTHER IN OUR ARMS. 

317
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:47,533
AND AS THEY HEAL, WE AS A CITY 

318
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,701
MUST HEAL. 

319
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,770
NOT BY POINTING FINGERS BUT BY 

320
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,307
FINDING COMPASSION AND CONCERN 

321
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,376
AND ACTUALLY BEING A 

322
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,078
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY. 

323
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,614
I HAVE MET THESE PEOPLE. 

324
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,050
THEY WERE CELEBRATING TOGETHER 

325
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,386
THE POSSIBILITY OF A NEW SCHOOL.

326
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:08,921
THAT IS WHO I KNOW WE ARE. 

327
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,157
WE ARE BETTER THAN WHAT WE SAW. 

328
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,392
IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IN YOUR 

329
00:13:13,392 --> 00:13:14,393
NEIGHBORHOOD OR YOUR COMMUNITY, 

330
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:17,763
IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN YOUR BLOCK,

331
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,098
BUT THAT BLOCK, THAT 

332
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:19,899
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THAT 

333
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,735
COMMUNITIES IN THE CITY OF 

334
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,936
CHICAGO AND IS PART OF OUR 

335
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:24,303
HOME. 

336
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:25,905
THE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THAT UP, 

337
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:30,242
THAT COMMUNITY KNOW THAT THEY 

338
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,746
HAVE A CITY THAT STANDS WITH 

339
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,581
THEM. 

340
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,950
AS I SAID TO THE DOCTORS AND 

341
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,854
NURSES THIS WEEKEND DO NOT 

342
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:45,057
FORGET TO TAKE CARE OF 

343
00:13:45,057 --> 00:13:47,660
YOURSELVES AS WELL. 

344
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,497
MY PARENTS MET AT MOUNT SINAI. 

345
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,633
THEY DID A HEROIC JOB AS THE 

346
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:59,672
POLICE OFFICERS DID. BUT THEY 

347
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,141
TOO HAVE A SOUL. 

348
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:10,049
THEY TOO HAVE A HEART. 

349
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,085
AND THIS REPS AT BOTH OF THOSE. 

350
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:15,353
WE OWE IT TO EACH OTHER TO DO 

351
00:14:15,353 --> 00:14:20,359
BETTER AND BE BETTER. 

352
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:25,531
>> I WILL TAKE A QUESTION TAKE 

353
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,068
QUESTIONS. 

354
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,971
-- WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. 

355
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:35,641
>> WE HAVE REALLY GOOD LEADS ON 

356
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,676
QUITE A FEW OF THEM. 

357
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,044
WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY PHYSICAL 

358
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:57,396
ARRESTS YET. 

359
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:04,103
AND THIS RIPS AT BOTH OF THOSE. 

360
00:15:04,103 --> 00:15:07,773
>> [ INDISCERNIBLE QUESTION ] 

361
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:12,177
>> WE HAD A FEW THAT WERE LARGE 

362
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:12,878
GATHERINGS ON PARTICULAR 

363
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,111
BLOCKS. 

364
00:15:13,111 --> 00:15:16,081
I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WHAT WE SAW 

365
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,918
THIS WEEKEND, IT JUST RIPS IT 

366
00:15:19,918 --> 00:15:23,222
EVERYTHING THAT I BELIEVE IN. 

367
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,192
BECAUSE I KNOW AS A CITY AND AS 

368
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:29,328
A NEIGHBORHOOD THESE 

369
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,930
NEIGHBORHOODS CAN DO BETTER. 

370
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,732
CERTAINLY, CPD CAN DO BETTER 

371
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:37,603
BUT THAT THE END OF THE DAY, 

372
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,538
THE MEMBERS OF THE CBT DON'T GO 

373
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:41,673
TO BED WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS 

374
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:42,074
THAT NIGHT. 

375
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:44,043
THEY DON'T WAKE UP WITH THEM IN 

376
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:46,345
THE MORNING. 

377
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,546
IT IS RARE WE ACTUALLY WITNESS 

378
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,080
THIS STUFF. 

379
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,981
SOMEBODY KNOWS WHO DID IT. 

380
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:49,381
THEY DO. 

381
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:50,549
THEY KNOW THAT. 

382
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,117
THEY HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE. 

383
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,788
THEY HOLD THE MAYOR ACCOUNTABLE.

384
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,156
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY? 

385
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,858
YOU KNOW WHAT I NEVER HEAR, I 

386
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,060
HEAR PEOPLE HOLDING US 

387
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,394
ACCOUNTABLE BUT I NEVER HEAR 

388
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:03,195
PEOPLE SAYING THESE INDIVIDUALS 

389
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:08,567
OUT HERE NEED TO STOP PULLING 

390
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:08,900
THE TRIGGER. 

391
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,367
I NEVER HEAR THAT. 

392
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,702
I NEVER HEAR THAT. 

393
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:11,903
THEY GET A PASS FROM EVERYBODY. 

394
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,205
AND THEY SHOULD NOT. 

395
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:19,445
THEY SHOULD NOT. YOU SHOULD BE 

396
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:20,679
ABLE TO GATHER ON YOUR BLOCK 

397
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,880
AND HAVE A PARTY WITHOUT THE 

398
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,182
FEAR OF BEING GUNNED DOWN. 

399
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,216
IT IS THE SAME INDIVIDUALS THAT 

400
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:24,817
CONTINUOUSLY COMMIT THESE 

401
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,050
CRIMES. 

402
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,252
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY? 

403
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:30,222
>> IT IS HARD FOR ME TO -- 

404
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,256
FORGIVE ME. 

405
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:35,728
I'VE BEEN SHOT. I WAS A DRUG 

406
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:39,031
DEALER FOR HEALTH MY LIFE AND I 

407
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,065
SHOT A LOT OF PEOPLE. 

408
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,166
ABOUT A WEEK AGO, WE GOT 

409
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,236
TOGETHER WITH MOST OF THE HEADS 

410
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,504
OF THE GANGS, THE FOUNDERS AND 

411
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,205
PEOPLE THAT WERE IN THE ROOM 

412
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:50,309
THAT NODDED THAT THEY WERE 

413
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,343
SHOOTERS, AND IN THAT MEETING, 

414
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,811
THEY EXPRESSED THAT THEY WERE 

415
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:56,314
TIRED OF SOME OF THEIR LOOSE 

416
00:16:56,314 --> 00:16:57,649
CANNONS THAT ARE GOING OUT AND 

417
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:57,916
SHOOTING. 

418
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,285
ONE OF THE THINGS -- I'M FROM 

419
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:03,022
NEW YORK CITY, MY COMMITMENT IS 

420
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,156
TO BE HERE FOR THE SUMMER. 

421
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:07,259
I'VE BEEN 24 DAYS WITHOUT FOOD 

422
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,596
AND HOPING FOR A WEEK OF PEACE 

423
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:10,996
IN CHICAGO. 

424
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:11,864
WHILE WE HAVE BEEN HERE, I 

425
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,634
DON'T SEE -- IN THOSE 

426
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,935
NEIGHBORHOODS, THERE CRIME 

427
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:19,171
STOPPER SIGNS ALL OVER 

428
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,873
BILLBOARDS THAT SAID IF YOU SEE 

429
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,642
SOMETHING, CALL THIS NUMBER. 

430
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,377
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY YOURSELF. 

431
00:17:26,377 --> 00:17:27,279
I'M JUST WONDERING, ARE YOU AT 

432
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,149
A POINT NOW WHERE YOU WOULD 

433
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,986
SAY, HEY, I'M CLERGY. 

434
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:41,760
CAN X GANG NUMBERS THEIR X GAME 

435
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:49,268
-- EX GANG MEMBERS COME IN? 

436
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:49,835
WE ARE NOT CHICAGO. 

437
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:54,039
WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING CAN WE 

438
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,741
MAKE THIS A NATIONAL ISSUE. 

439
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,044
MAYBE IT IS HAPPENING BUT I 

440
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:00,178
PRAY FOR YOU REGULARLY. 

441
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:03,048
I PRAY THAT YOU KNOCK THIS OUT 

442
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:03,749
OF THE PARK. 

443
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:04,883
WE WANT TO BE SAFE. 

444
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,253
MY WIFE AND I HAD TO DIVE ON 

445
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,021
THE FLOOR WHILE WE WERE DRIVING 

446
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:14,493
HERE. 

447
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:15,427
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, LISTEN, I 

448
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,663
APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS. 

449
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:18,697
THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR 

450
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:22,534
QUESTION IS YES, WE ARE DOING 

451
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:22,734
THAT. 

452
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:23,569
SINCE IT BECAME THE 

453
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,903
SUPERINTENDENT I'VE BEEN ALL 

454
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:25,771
OVER THE COUNTRY AS WELL AS MY 

455
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,572
STAFF COLLABORATING WITH OTHER 

456
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:31,677
AGENCIES TO DO JUST WHAT YOU 

457
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,377
ARE TALKING ABOUT. 

458
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:34,012
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU ARE 

459
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:34,379
EXACTLY RIGHT. 

460
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,047
A LOT OF THE SHOOTERS THAT I 

461
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:36,982
TALKED TO ARE TIRED OF IT. 

462
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,283
IF YOU'RE TIRED OF IT, PROVE 

463
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,419
YOU'RE TIRED OF IT. 

464
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,620
GET YOUR FRIENDS TO PUT DOWN 

465
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,487
THE GUNS. 

466
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:45,691
>> PEOPLE TALKING TO YOU AND 

467
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:51,696
GIVING TIPS ABOUT -- 

468
00:18:51,696 --> 00:18:51,963
>> RIGHT. 

469
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,365
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO SEVERAL 

470
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:53,765
INDIVIDUALS. 

471
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,468
LISTEN, THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE 

472
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,869
IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE 

473
00:18:57,869 --> 00:18:59,171
GOOD PEOPLE FAR OUTWEIGH THE 

474
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,272
BAD PEOPLE. 

475
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:00,772
THEY DO. 

476
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,975
THEY ARE SICK OF IT. 

477
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,077
I GOT SEVERAL CALLS THIS 

478
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,245
MORNING MYSELF. 

479
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:09,014
I THINK HALF THE CITY HAS MY 

480
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:09,447
CELL PHONE NUMBER. 

481
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,617
PEOPLE CALLED TO GIVE ME TIPS. 

482
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,518
WE WORK HARD WITH THE DETECTIVE 

483
00:19:13,518 --> 00:19:15,019
DIVISION AND THE STATE'S 

484
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:18,824
ATTORNEY OFFICE TO MAKE SURE IF 

485
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:23,695
YOU DO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY 

486
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,496
IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO 

487
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,097
KEEP YOU SAFE. 

488
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,732
>> LET ME DO ONE THING AND THEN 

489
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,033
WRITE TO YOU. 

490
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,168
-- RIGHT TO YOU. 

491
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:33,205
>> I REGULARLY ATTEND CHURCH. 

492
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,842
MUCH TO MY RABBI'S CHAGRIN BUT 

493
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,710
I DO. 

494
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,946
I HAVE SEEN LOVE, COMPASSION, 

495
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:45,817
AND A SENSE OF UNITY IN THE 

496
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,818
LACE OF FAITH ON SUNDAY. 

497
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,253
IT NEEDS TO BE OUT ON THE 

498
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:48,720
STREETS. 

499
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,623
SUNDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. 

500
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,524
NOT JUST CONFINED TO THE WALLS 

501
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,760
OF A PLACE OF WORSHIP. I'VE 

502
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,794
SEEN A LOT OF LEADERS AND 

503
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,095
MEMBERS OF THE CONGREGATION DO 

504
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:57,428
EXACTLY THAT. 

505
00:19:57,428 --> 00:19:59,464
TAKE THAT FAITH, TAKE THE 

506
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,068
NEIGHBORHOOD OUT TO THE STREET. 

507
00:20:03,068 --> 00:20:04,736
THAT'S OF THE PASTOR DID ON THE 

508
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,170
WESTSIDE. 

509
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,872
THAT'S WHAT I NUMBER ON THE 

510
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,974
SULCI DO. 

511
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:13,645
-- SOUTH SIDE DO. 

512
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:14,680
DON'T THINK PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 

513
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,016
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE., 

514
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:21,553
WHO ACTUALLY DID THIS. IF YOU 

515
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,020
SAY TO YOURSELF, ENOUGH IS 

516
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,058
ENOUGH, WILL THAT IMPLORE YOU 

517
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,659
TO THEN DO SOMETHING SO THIS 

518
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,462
DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN? 

519
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,131
THE OFFENDER IN ALMOST EVERY 

520
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,435
SITUATION IS KNOWN. 

521
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,102
KNOWN BY SOMEBODY. 

522
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:40,572
THEY HAVE A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

523
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,975
TO SPEAK UP SO THERE CAN BE 

524
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:46,578
LEGAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE 

525
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,780
ACTIONS. 

526
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,316
>> MAYOR, -- 

527
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,684
>> I PROMISE. 

528
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,886
>> YOU MENTIONED THAT THE 

529
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:55,921
NUMBERS ARE DOWN, 

530
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,957
SUPERINTENDENT. 

531
00:20:58,957 --> 00:20:59,958
WHY THEN SUCH A VIOLENT WEEKEND 

532
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:00,358
THIS WEEKEND? 

533
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:01,393
WHAT IS YOUR INVESTIGATION TOLD 

534
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:03,161
YOU ABOUT THE DYNAMICS THAT LED 

535
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:09,001
TO THESE THINGS AS LAST 

536
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:09,267
WEEKEND? 

537
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:10,535
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, IS IT THE 

538
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:10,802
WEATHER? 

539
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,303
IS IT THIS? 

540
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,370
IS IT THAT? 

541
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,772
NO. 

542
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,906
IT'S THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE 

543
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:15,607
PEOPLE PULLING THE TRIGGERS. 

544
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,508
THAT'S WHAT IT IS. 

545
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,542
WEATHER, ALL THAT DOES IS 

546
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:26,585
AFFORD MORE PEOPLE TO BE OUT. 

547
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,686
THE WEATHER DOESN'T CAUSE A 

548
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,121
PROBLEM TO SAY IT IS 90 DEGREES 

549
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,021
AND I'M GOING TO SHOOT 

550
00:21:30,021 --> 00:21:30,355
SOMEBODY. 

551
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:31,356
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. 

552
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,424
IT IS SIMPLY HOLDING THESE 

553
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,225
INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE. 

554
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,292
THE FACT THAT WE HAD SO MUCH 

555
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:35,394
THIS WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, WE'LL 

556
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,928
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF WE CAN 

557
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:37,796
DETERMINE THAT. 

558
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,400
LISTEN, THIS WAS CONTAINED IN 

559
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,906
ROUGHLY 4 DISTRICTS IN THE CITY.

560
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:49,341
SO IT IS NOT LIKE THOSE PEOPLE 

561
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:50,542
GOT TOGETHER AND SAID WE ARE 

562
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:51,343
GOING TO CREATE CHAOS. 

563
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,578
THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. 

564
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:54,613
IT'S A MATTER OF US BEING 

565
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:56,248
BETTER AS A SOCIETY, HOLDING 

566
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:57,582
PEOPLE THAT PULL TRIGGERS 

567
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,618
ACCOUNTABLE. 

568
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:02,888
SUPERINTENDENT -- 

569
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,725
>> THERE WAS NO DRAIN OF 

570
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:07,793
RESOURCES REGARDING LOLLAPALOOZA

571
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,194
. THAT WAS ALL OVERTIME. 

572
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:25,143
IT CAN I ADD ONE THING TO THIS? 

573
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:26,344
>> AS THE SUPERINTENDENT JUST 

574
00:22:26,344 --> 00:22:28,280
NOTED, THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR OR 

575
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,249
FIVE DISTRICTS THAT THE BULK OF 

576
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,817
THIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND GANG 

577
00:22:32,817 --> 00:22:36,354
VIOLENCE HAPPENED. 

578
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,255
THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS AND 

579
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:38,256
COMMUNITIES SIMILAR TO THE ONES 

580
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,858
WHERE THIS HAPPENED, WERE 

581
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,725
NOTHING HAPPENED. 

582
00:22:40,725 --> 00:22:41,860
SIMILAR WEATHER CONDITIONS. 

583
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,095
SIMILAR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. 

584
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:48,166
SIMILAR FAMILY CULTURAL -- THE 

585
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,502
QUESTION IS, WHAT MADE THAT 

586
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,503
DIFFERENT? 

587
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:58,376
AND I'M CONSTANTLY -- YOU ASKED 

588
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,812
AN APPROPRIATE QUESTION. 

589
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,847
THE QUESTION WAS ASKED WHERE 

590
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,448
ARE THE POLICE AND WHAT WERE 

591
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:04,216
THEY DOING? 

592
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,184
WHAT HAPPENED HERE? 

593
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:09,354
WHAT WAS THE DISTRIBUTION? 

594
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,355
THERE IS ANOTHER SET OF 

595
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:10,855
QUESTIONS, LEGITIMATE 

596
00:23:10,855 --> 00:23:11,490
QUESTIONS. 

597
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,590
I'M NOT QUESTIONING THE 

598
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,758
QUESTIONS. 

599
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,594
THERE IS A COMPONENT OF THIS 

600
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:20,465
THAT GETS AMORAL, ETHICAL, 

601
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:25,770
VALUE PEACE THAT IS A QUESTION 

602
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:26,805
THAT MUST ALSO HAVE EQUAL 

603
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:27,038
VALUE. 

604
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,440
AND BE MEASURED IN THE SAME 

605
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:28,740
WAY. 

606
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,911
AND I DO WANT TO IMPLORE -- 

607
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,145
HAVING TALKED TO ONE MOTHER 

608
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:39,618
TODAY, WHO LOST A CHILD, SHE 

609
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,019
DID EVERYTHNG RIGHT AS A 

610
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:45,023
PARENT. 

611
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,924
HER CHILD HAS BEEN STOLEN FOR 

612
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:46,124
HER. 

613
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,427
FOR HER FRIENDS, THAT CHILD 

614
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,395
WILL NEVER HAVE A CHILDHOOD 

615
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,162
AGAIN. 

616
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:54,132
AND THEREFORE, WE MUST USE THAT 

617
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:57,035
TO HEAL OURSELVES AND BE BETTER 

618
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,537
WHICH REQUIRES A COMPONENT THAT 

619
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:01,540
DOESN'T LOOK AT ALL THE 

620
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,643
CONDITIONS BUT ACTUALLY ASKS 

621
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:08,813
WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER. AND YOU 

622
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,282
MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR 

623
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,550
WHAT YOU DID. 

624
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,685
>> MAYOR -- 

625
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:19,057
>> IT IS TIME TO WORK -- IN 

626
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:23,094
CHICAGO. 

627
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:28,366
IS IT TIME TO -- BROADER 

628
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:29,334
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE? 

629
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:33,938
>> LISTEN, I WILL TELL YOU FROM 

630
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:34,539
A LAW ENFORCEMENT STANDPOINT, 

631
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,674
WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE 

632
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:36,841
FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 

633
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:38,310
AGENCIES. 

634
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,377
I DON'T THINK THE RELATIONSHIP 

635
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:43,281
BETWEEN CPT AND THE FBI, ATF, 

636
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,650
AND FBI HAVE EVER BEEN AS 

637
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,052
STRONG AS IT IS NOW. 

638
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,319
WE ARE ALREADY DOING THOSE 

639
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,590
THINGS. 

640
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,023
WE DO BETTER? 

641
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:52,324
YES. 

642
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,158
WE ALWAYS CAN DO BETTER. 

643
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,193
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE 

644
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:55,994
RESPONSIBILITY OF THINGS LIKE 

645
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,662
WE SAW THIS WEEKEND IS 

646
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,262
EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBILITY. 

647
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:00,198
>> YOU KNOW THIS. 

648
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:04,135
THERE WERE ATF AGENTS WHO WERE 

649
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,770
OUT WITH POLICE OFFICERS DOING 

650
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:10,608
WORK -- I THINK IT WAS IN THE 

651
00:25:10,608 --> 00:25:11,476
NINTH DISTRICT. 

652
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:12,077
>> YES. 

653
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:16,814
>> THE AGENT WAS SHOT. 

654
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,016
THAT'S A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF WHAT 

655
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,049
THEY ARE DOING WORKING. 

656
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:22,487
AGAIN, I WANT TO UNDERSCORE WHAT

657
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:23,221
THE SUPERINTENDENT SAID. 

658
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:24,890
EVERYBODY IS POINTING IT 

659
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,991
SOMETHING SAYING THEM. 

660
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,293
THE CRIMINAL AND THE CRIMINAL 

661
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,296
ACTIVITY AND THE GANG HAVE TO 

662
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,966
BE RAISED RATHER THAN TO SAY 

663
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,034
WHAT DID THE POLICE DO, WHAT 

664
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,835
ARE THE FEDS DOING? 

665
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:38,069
THOSE ARE LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS 

666
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:41,039
BUT NOT IN THE OF ANOTHER SET 

667
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,207
OF QUESTIONS. 

668
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:46,378
NOT IN LIEU OF ASKING WHERE IS 

669
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,379
THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE GANG OR 

670
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,213
THE CULTURE THAT CONDONES 

671
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,650
RATHER THAN CONDEMNS. 

672
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,085
COLLECTIVELY. 

673
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:59,658
I WANT TO REPEAT, THERE ARE 

674
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:00,392
GOOD PEOPLE IN THESE 

675
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,259
NEIGHBORHOODS WHO HOLD UP ALL 

676
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,727
THE VALUES OF WHAT IT TAKES TO 

677
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,929
CREATE A MORAL CENTER FOR 

678
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,063
NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITY. 

679
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,898
AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO RIP AT 

680
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:09,334
IT. 

681
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,535
AND IF YOU KNOW THAT, THEY 

682
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:11,769
COULD NOT BE PART OF IT. 

683
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:14,806
THEY TEAR AT THE VERY FABRIC. 

684
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,073
>> HOTTIE CHANGED THAT, MAYOR? 

685
00:26:16,073 --> 00:26:21,446
>> -- HOW DO I CHANGE THAT, 

686
00:26:21,446 --> 00:26:21,780
MAYOR? 

687
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:25,650
>> I HAVE MY RESPONSIBILITY AS 

688
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:25,883
A MAN. 

689
00:26:25,883 --> 00:26:28,219
WHEN IT COMES TO VALUES -- AND 

690
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:31,256
I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, THERE 

691
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,992
IS POLICING, THERE IS PUBLIC 

692
00:26:34,992 --> 00:26:38,563
SERVANTS, THERE ARE PRINCIPLES, 

693
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:41,633
THERE ARE PASTORS, AND THEIR 

694
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:42,634
APPEARANCE. 

695
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,703
AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE PLAY A 

696
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:45,603
ROLE. 

697
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:49,541
WE HAVE -- ONE OF THE THINGS 

698
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:50,775
I'M TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE 

699
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:54,612
TAKING ONE OF THOSE MENTORS AND 

700
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:58,049
GIVE THEM 3 YEARS, I NEED THE 

701
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:05,757
PARENTS TO TEACH KIDS NOT JUST I

702
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:08,226
, WE NEED TO TEACH THE KIDS. 

703
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,496
I MET A MOM. SINGLE MOM OF 

704
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,298
THREE BOYS. 

705
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,532
ONE IS APPLYING AT THE 

706
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:14,965
UNIVERSITY CHICAGO. 

707
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,367
WHAT DID SHE DO? 

708
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,936
SHE CLEANS AT A SCHOOL. 

709
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,370
BY HERSELF, RAISING THREE BOYS 

710
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,806
ALL GOING TO UNBELIEVABLE 

711
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:28,146
SCHOOLS. 

712
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,447
SHE IS INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES. 

713
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,082
I WILL SAY AS A FATHER OF THREE 

714
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:31,982
CHILDREN, PARENTING IS 

715
00:27:31,982 --> 00:27:34,018
ESSENTIAL. 

716
00:27:34,018 --> 00:27:35,353
A PLACE OF WORSHIP AND FAITH 

717
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,689
THAT BUILDS A SENSE OF MORAL 

718
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,625
CHARACTER AND JUDGMENT TO NOT 

719
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,760
JUST THE INDIVIDUAL BUT ALL OF 

720
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,728
US, THAT'S A COMPONENT OF IT AS 

721
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:47,632
MUCH AS REPLACING DESPAIR WITH 

722
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:48,333
HOPE. 

723
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,267
THAT PLAYS A COMPONENT OF IT. 

724
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:53,071
AS MUCH AS WHAT THE POLICE DO. 

725
00:27:53,071 --> 00:27:56,574
EVERY TIME WE DO THIS, IT IS 

726
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:57,742
FINGER-POINTING AT SOMEBODY 

727
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,978
ELSE WITHOUT ALSO ASKING A 

728
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:03,181
LARGER QUESTION. 

729
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,149
I WILL TAKE MY RESPONSIBILITY 

730
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:05,417
ON THE MORAL COMPONENT. 

731
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,285
AND I WILL TAKE WHERE I HAVE 

732
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,687
FALLEN SHORT. BUT THE QUESTION 

733
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:13,091
IS IF BY POINTING ONE FINGER AT 

734
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:16,060
ONE PERSON, THAT'S NOT HOW YOU 

735
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,529
-- ALL OF US COLLECTIVELY AND 

736
00:28:18,529 --> 00:28:23,802
EVENTUALLY -- INDIVIDUALLY. 

737
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,603
SINCE I STARTED TALKING ABOUT 

738
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:27,605
THE JEWISH FAITH, I WILL CLOSE 

739
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,073
WITH THIS. 

740
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:30,708
THIS IS WHAT I SAID TO MY KIDS 

741
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,144
AND EACH ONE ON THEIR PERMITS 

742
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:34,579
FOR WHEN THEY BECOME ADULTS. 

743
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:38,783
THE RABBI SAID WHO ARE YOU IF 

744
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,118
YOU'RE NOT FOR YOURSELF. 

745
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,486
WHAT ARE YOU IF YOU'RE ONLY FOR 

746
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:41,753
YOURSELF? 

747
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:42,887
IF NOT NOW, THEN WHEN? 

748
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,723
THAT IS A MORAL QUESTION ALL OF 

749
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:47,959
US INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY

750
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,127
MUST ASK OURSELVES. 

751
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,130
>> IF THESE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WENT

752
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,900
THEY TURNING IN THE BAD GUYS? 

753
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,001
>> THAT'S A QUESTION WE'VE BEEN 

754
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,469
ASKING FOR QUITE SOME TIME. 

755
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:00,104
SO LISTEN, THAT SOMETHING THEY 

756
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:01,272
HAVE TO DO BETTER AT. 

757
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:05,643
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT -- I 

758
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:06,845
WOULD NEVER RUN AWAY FROM THE 

759
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:07,979
FACT THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 

760
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,114
HAS ISSUES IN CERTAIN 

761
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:10,414
COMMITTEES. 

762
00:29:10,414 --> 00:29:13,651
I WOULD NEVER HIDE THAT FACT. 

763
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:15,587
WE'VE HAD ISSUES. I'VE BEEN A 

764
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,187
COP FOR 30 YEARS. 

765
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:19,257
DON'T THINK I'M NACVE OR TONE 

766
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,158
DEAF TO THAT. 

767
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:20,558
I'M NOT. 

768
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,159
WE ARE WORKING HARD TO REPAIR 

769
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,696
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE COMMUNITY. 

770
00:29:24,696 --> 00:29:28,700
ESPECIALLY THE LACK COMMITTEES 

771
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,100
WITH CPD. 

772
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,436
THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO. 

773
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:36,207
I DON'T ENJOY THIS. 

774
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,508
I KNOW IT IS THE REALITY OF 

775
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:38,643
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING UP. 

776
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:39,744
I HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO 

777
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:40,378
MAKE CPD BETTER. 

778
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,213
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. 

779
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,847
BUT WHAT I'M ASKING FOR THE 

780
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:48,586
COMMUNITY TO STEP UP AND DO 

781
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:49,120
THEIR PART ALSO. 

782
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,921
WE CAN'T SOLVE THESE THINGS 

783
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:50,554
WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY. 

784
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:52,156
CPD IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE 

785
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,558
FAITH THE COMMUNITY HAS IN IT. 

786
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,826
SO TO ME AND MY STAFF TO TRY TO 

787
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:58,096
REPAIR THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. 

788
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,063
WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS. 

789
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:03,701
AT THE SAME TIME, IT SIMPLY 

790
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:04,903
CAN'T BE PLACED AT THE DOORSTEP 

791
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,738
OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND 

792
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:09,607
EXPECT THEM TO HANDLE IT. 

793
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:10,241
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ISN'T 

794
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,777
HERE TO RAISE CHILDREN. 

795
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:13,278
WE ARE NOT. 

796
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,712
I TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE COME 

797
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,815
UP TO US TALK ABOUT THEIR KIDS 

798
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,350
AND WHAT WE CAN DO. 

799
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,784
NO. 

800
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:20,885
IS NOT ABOUT WHAT THE POLICE 

801
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:21,386
DEPARTMENT CAN DO. 

802
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,155
IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. 

803
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,689
AND SOMETIMES IT DOES TAKE A 

804
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:28,326
VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD. 

805
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,527
I'M OKAY WITH THAT. 

806
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:31,262
WHEN WE SEE PARENTS STRUGGLING, 

807
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,498
IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO REACH 

808
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,100
BACK AND HELP THEM. 

809
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,869
HELP THEM BE BETTER PARENTS. 

810
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:39,637
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE CPD 

811
00:30:39,637 --> 00:30:40,071
PART OF IT. 

812
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:42,440
BUT WE STILL NEED THE COMMUNITY

813
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,912
'S HELP IN RESOLVING SOME OF 

814
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:48,313
THESE ISSUES. 

815
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:49,647
IT SHOULD BE HEARTBREAKING FOR 

816
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:50,648
EVERYBODY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED 

817
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:51,616
THIS WEEKEND. 

818
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:55,320
AND AGAIN, IT WAS CONTAINED -- 

819
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,655
OUT OF 22 DISTRICTS IT WAS 

820
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:59,924
ABOUT CONTAIN TO FOUR OF THEM. 

821
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:04,462
THE CITY ISN'T ON FIRE. 

822
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:06,598
WE JUST NEED TO DO WHAT WE NEED 

823
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:06,998
TO DO. 

824
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:11,369
>> [ INDISCERNIBLE QUESTION ] 

825
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:17,675
AND YOU TALK TO SOME THESE 

826
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:21,012
PEOPLE AND -- 

827
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,182
>> THAT'S A FRUSTRATION THAT I 

828
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:25,350
SEE. 

829
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:31,589
LISTEN, MY RELATIVES, PEOPLE I 

830
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,991
GREW UP WITH IN THE CITY CALL 

831
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:36,160
ME ALL THE TIME. 

832
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,662
AND WHAT WORRIES ME IS THAT IN 

833
00:31:37,662 --> 00:31:38,897
CERTAIN AREAS OF THE CITY WE 

834
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,998
BEGIN TO NORMALIZE THESE 

835
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:40,231
THINGS. 

836
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,500
AND IT ISN'T NORMAL FOR A CHILD 

837
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,269
TO GROW UP -- LET ME DIGRESS 

838
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:48,339
FOR A MOMENT. 

839
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,208
I WAS OUT ON THE WEST SIDE ONE 

840
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,976
DAY. 

841
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,011
AND I WAS JUST WATCHING KIDS 

842
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,513
PLAY ON A PLAYGROUND. 

843
00:31:55,513 --> 00:31:56,347
AND RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER 

844
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,382
FROM WHERE WE WERE SITTING, 

845
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,717
THERE WAS ABOUT FOUR GUNSHOTS. 

846
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:05,490
BAM, BAM, BAM. I SEE THESE KIDS 

847
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,224
IMMEDIATELY GO DOWN ON THE 

848
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:06,958
GROUND. 

849
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:08,659
WE GO AROUND THE CORNER AND WE 

850
00:32:08,659 --> 00:32:09,761
COULD STILL SEE THE SMOKE. 

851
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,531
BUT THOSE OFFENDERS WERE GONE. 

852
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:14,732
AS WE ARE GOING AROUND THE 

853
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,000
BLOCK, WE GO BACK PAST THE 

854
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:16,300
PLAYGROUND. 

855
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,336
THOSE KIDS THAT HAD DUCKED DOWN 

856
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,672
ARE NOW BACK PLAYING LIKE 

857
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,072
NOTHING HAPPENED. 

858
00:32:22,072 --> 00:32:23,975
THAT'S NOT NORMAL. 

859
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,743
IT'S NOT NORMAL FOR THOSE KIDS 

860
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:26,511
TO THINK THAT'S OKAY. 

861
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,747
AND I THINK IN CERTAIN ASPECTS, 

862
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:33,217
WE BECOME DESENSITIZED TO THIS 

863
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,953
TYPE OF THING. 

864
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,788
AND WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. 

865
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,488
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS 

866
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,658
WITH PEOPLE NOW ABOUT STANDING 

867
00:32:41,658 --> 00:32:46,431
UP TRAUMA TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE 

868
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,635
WHEN THIS TYPE OF THINGS -- 

869
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,703
THING HAPPENS. 

870
00:32:52,703 --> 00:32:54,205
THE WORST THING WE CAN DO IS 

871
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,473
NOT DO ANYTHING AND LET FOLKS 

872
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,441
BECOME DESENSITIZED. 

873
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,008
THIS ISN'T RIGHT. 

874
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,843
IT IS NOT NORMAL. 

875
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,411
THEY SHOULDN'T BE GROWING UP 

876
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:04,015
LIKE THAT. 

877
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:11,222
>> [ INDISCERNIBLE QUESTION ] 

878
00:33:37,415 --> 00:33:42,754
>> YOU KNOW WHAT -- 

879
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,055
>> WE HAVE JUST BEEN LISTENING 

880
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:46,357
TO EDDIE JOHNSON AND MAYOR 

881
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:51,329
EMANUEL REACTING  TO THE RASH 

882
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,997
OF GUN VIOLENCE OVER THE 

883
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:53,998
WEEKEND STARTING SATURDAY AT 

884
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,700
MIDNIGHT. 

885
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,068
DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE 

886
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,136
WERE SHOT. 

887
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,738
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED. 

888
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,207
POSSIBLY 10 SO FAR. 

889
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,142
THESE NUMBERS ARE FLUCTUATING 

890
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:05,676
BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH GUN 

891
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,778
VIOLENCE. 

892
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:07,879
POLICE ARE SAYING THE VIOLENCE 

893
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,846
WAS TARGETED. 

894
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:12,350
IT WAS GANG RELATED. 

895
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,521
THEY WERE SHORT UPS AT A 

896
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,054
FUNERAL, AND A BLOCK PARTY, IT 

897
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:18,956
PLACES WHERE PEOPLE HAD 

898
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,690
GATHERED ON FRONT PORCHES. 

899
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,527
THE MAYOR AND THE POLICE CHIEF 

900
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:26,563
SUNDAY PARTICULARLY EXASPERATED.

901
00:34:26,563 --> 00:34:29,634
-- SOUNDING PARTICULARLY 

902
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,234
EXASPERATED. 

903
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,503
MURDERS ARE DOWN IN CHICAGO BUT 

904
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:34,471
A WEEKEND LIKE THIS HIGHLIGHTS 

905
00:34:34,471 --> 00:34:36,974
JUST HOW DISTURBING THE TREND 

906
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:37,542
IS. 

907
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,645
EVEN WITH THE REDUCTION IN 

908
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:41,812
VIOLENCE, IT STILL IS OUT OF 

909
00:34:41,812 --> 00:34:42,079
CONTROL. 

910
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,616
AND THE CHIEF WANTED PEOPLE TO 

911
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,152
KNOW THAT REALLY, THE FOCUS WAS 

912
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,786
ON FOUR DISTRICTS ON THE WEST 

913
00:34:49,786 --> 00:34:51,489
SIDE OF CHICAGO. 

914
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,824
WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A 

915
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,059
CITYWIDE PROBLEM. 

916
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,860
IT IS CONCENTRATED TO SPECIFIC 

917
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,363
AREAS BUT IT IS BAD IN CERTAIN 

918
00:34:59,363 --> 00:34:59,596
AREAS. 

919
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:01,465
WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE POLICE 

920
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,901
CHIEF AND THE BEAR WAS A DESIRE 

921
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:06,571
THAT -- AND THE MAYOR WAS A 

922
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,172
DESIRE THAT PEOPLE COME FORWARD 

923
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:09,640
AND HELP. 

924
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,676
I THINK IT WAS INTERESTING THAT 

925
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,511
MAYOR EMANUEL USED A PHRASE  

926
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,545
HIGHLIGHTING MORALITY. 

927
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,780
HE CALLED IT MORAL 

928
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,182
RESPONSIBILITY TO COME FORWARD 

929
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:22,420
AND ASSIST THE POLICE. 

930
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,088
BUT THINGS ARE COMPLICATED IN 

931
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:24,555
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS. 

932
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,591
SCHOOLS ARE STRETCHED TO THE 

933
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,191
LIMIT. 

934
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:29,126
GOOD JOBS ARE HARD TO COME BY. 

935
00:35:29,126 --> 00:35:30,995
THIS SORT OF GUN VIOLENCE 

936
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,797
DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A VACUUM. 

937
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,966
THERE ARE TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF 

938
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,101
TRENDS THAT INJURY TO THIS. 

939
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,371
SHOCKOE -- CHICAGO HAS BECOME 

940
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:42,572
THE POSTER CITY FOR THIS GUN 

941
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:43,341
VIOLENCE. 

942
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,544
THEY HAVE REMOVED MORE THAN 

943
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,878
5000 GUNS FROM THE STREETS LAST 

944
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:48,412
YEAR. 

945
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,782
THE CHIEF SAYING THEY RECEIVED 

946
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:52,850
60 MORE OF THE WEEKEND. 

947
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,752
WE WANT TO BRING IN OUR 

948
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,786
NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT, DEAN 

949
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:56,754
REYNOLDS. 

950
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:58,823
YOU ARE IN THAT PRESS 

951
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,223
CONFERENCE. 

952
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,592
THE MAYOR, MAYOR EMANUEL, HE 

953
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:03,161
LOOKED  EMOTIONAL. 

954
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,329
HE USED THE PHRASE MORAL 

955
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,532
RESPONSIBILITY. 

956
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:09,567
HE WAS ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO 

957
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:13,404
COME FORWARD AND HELP POLICE. 

958
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:14,405
WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY? 

959
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,576
WHAT WAS THE HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU? 

960
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:19,610
>> Reporter: TO BE HONEST, 

961
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,611
WE'VE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES 

962
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:20,911
BEFORE. 

963
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:23,781
I'M SEEING THE MAYOR EXERCISE 

964
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:25,316
ABOUT THE VIOLENCE IN THE CITY 

965
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,119
MANY TIMES BEFORE. 

966
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:29,520
AND MAKE THE SAME POINT MANY 

967
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:29,886
TIMES. 

968
00:36:29,886 --> 00:36:32,523
ONE VERY FAMOUS MOMENT WHEN YOU 

969
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,994
SAID WHO RAISED YOU IN 

970
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:37,995
REFERENCE TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 

971
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:39,096
DOING THE SHOOTINGS. 

972
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:40,464
SO, THERE IS REALLY NOTHING NEW 

973
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,932
HERE. 

974
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:43,334
THERE IS JUST MOUNTING 

975
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,303
FRUSTRATION. 

976
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:45,970
THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENT, 

977
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,739
EDDIE JOHNSON, SAID THAT THE 

978
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:50,174
POLICE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO 

979
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,276
IN RESTORING TRUST IN THESE 

980
00:36:52,276 --> 00:36:54,378
COMMUNITIES GETTING PEOPLE TO 

981
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,715
COME FORWARD AND IDENTIFY THOSE 

982
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,150
WHO ARE GUILTY OF DOING THE 

983
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,553
SHOOTINGS. 

984
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,788
YOU KNOW, IT OCCURS TO ME THAT 

985
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,323
IF WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 

986
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,491
SOMEWHERE AND WE WERE DISCUSSING

987
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:13,231
WANT TENT SHOOTING OF PEOPLE, 

988
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,564
WE'LL BE TALKING UNDER THE 

989
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:18,903
RUBRIC OF TERRORISM. 

990
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,872
BUT THEY ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO 

991
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,074
APPLY THAT LABEL TO WHAT IS 

992
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,175
GOING ON HERE. 

993
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:28,179
INSTEAD, THEY TALK ABOUT THE 

994
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,248
LACK OF OPPORTUNITIES. 

995
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,682
UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGH. 

996
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,251
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSING. 

997
00:37:34,251 --> 00:37:35,119
ETC., ETC. 

998
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,758
AGAIN, WE HAVE SEEN ALL OF THIS 

999
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:40,991
BEFORE. 

1000
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:42,093
THE QUESTION IS IF ANYTHING 

1001
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:42,993
WILL CHANGE BECAUSE OF IT. 

1002
00:37:42,993 --> 00:37:44,428
BECAUSE IT HAS NOT IN THE PAST. 

1003
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,697
>> BUT THERE HAS BEEN SOME 

1004
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:49,333
PROGRESSION MADE. 

1005
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,336
RIGHT? 

1006
00:37:52,336 --> 00:37:53,404
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE THOUSANDS 

1007
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,772
OF GUNS THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL 

1008
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,372
OFF THE STREETS. 

1009
00:37:55,372 --> 00:37:58,276
THE MAYOR TALKED ABOUT PROGRAMS.

1010
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,645
THIS WEEKENDS -- IT LOOKS 

1011
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:02,613
REALLY BAD. 

1012
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,249
HAVE THINGS BEEN IMPROVING? 

1013
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,451
>> Reporter: WELL, YES. 

1014
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,086
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE 

1015
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,456
CITY, THE ENTIRE CITY IS FINE. 

1016
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,657
IT'S FOUR DISTRICTS IN THE CITY 

1017
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:15,326
WERE ALL OF THIS STUFF IS GOING 

1018
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:15,526
DOWN. 

1019
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,262
THE REST OF CHICAGO IS PEACEFUL.

1020
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:21,365
THERE WAS A BIG LOLLAPALOOZA 

1021
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,668
CONCERT HERE OVER THE WEEKEND. 

1022
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:25,603
NO PROBLEMS THERE. 

1023
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:28,539
SO YES, THE VIOLENCE IS GOING 

1024
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:30,274
DOWN MARGINALLY. 

1025
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:33,744
THE PROBLEM AREAS ARE STILL THE 

1026
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:34,845
PROBLEM AREAS. 

1027
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,213
NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT, 

1028
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,082
NO MATTER HOW YOU CUT IT, THEY 

1029
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,985
KNOW WHERE THESE PROBLEM AREAS 

1030
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,185
ARE. 

1031
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,220
THE WONDER IS IF THEY KNEW 

1032
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,555
THERE WAS A BLOCK PARTY GOING 

1033
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:46,891
ON AFTER MIDNIGHT IN ONE OF THE 

1034
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,659
PROBLEM AREAS, WHY THEY DIDN'T 

1035
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,628
ASSIGN POLICE CRUISERS DOWN THE 

1036
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,898
BLOCK AS A DETERRENT. 

1037
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,633
WE HAVEN'T HAD AN ANSWER TO 

1038
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:56,333
THAT. 

1039
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,835
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 

1040
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,903
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO 

1041
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,204
SPECULATE A LITTLE BIT. 

1042
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:01,805
PLEASE FORGIVE ME. 

1043
00:39:01,805 --> 00:39:04,174
MAYOR EMANUEL  PUT THE PRESSURE 

1044
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:08,112
ON RESIDENTS TO DO MORE. 

1045
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,513
YOU SORT OF FRAMED IT AS A 

1046
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,147
MORAL RESPONSIBILITY. 

1047
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:12,783
I KNOW DURING THE WEEK THERE 

1048
00:39:12,783 --> 00:39:16,454
WERE HUGE DEMONSTRATIONS. THEY 

1049
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,588
BLOCKED THE STREET PROTESTING 

1050
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:17,888
VIOLENCE. 

1051
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,356
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MESSAGE 

1052
00:39:19,356 --> 00:39:25,663
FROM THE MAYOR WHO HAS BEEN 

1053
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,897
EMBATTLED, HOW IS THAT GOING TO 

1054
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,099
GO OVER WITH SOME OF THOSE 

1055
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,033
PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PROTESTING 

1056
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:29,633
OVER THE WEEKEND? 

1057
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,335
>> Reporter: WELL, I MEAN, HE 

1058
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,471
IS NOT REALLY SHIFTING BLAME OR 

1059
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:33,738
ANYTHING. 

1060
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:35,539
WHO CAN ARGUE THAT WHAT IS 

1061
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,476
GOING ON ON THE SOUTH AND WEST 

1062
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:39,476
SIDES IS MORAL? 

1063
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:40,344
YES. 

1064
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,547
MORALITY COMES INTO PLAY. 

1065
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,782
AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT 

1066
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,716
THESE WERE NOT HUGE 

1067
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,954
DEMONSTRATIONS. THEY WERE A 

1068
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,989
COUPLE HUNDRED PEOPLE 

1069
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,224
DEMONSTRATING ALONG LAKESHORE 

1070
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:53,457
DRIVE. 

1071
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:58,295
AND THEY WERE RECEIVED WELL IN 

1072
00:39:58,295 --> 00:39:59,196
THE NORTH SIDE COMMUNITIES 

1073
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:00,464
WHERE THEY MARCHED UP TO 

1074
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:02,733
WRIGLEY FIELD. 

1075
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,068
SO THERE IS SYMPATHY HERE. 

1076
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:04,969
THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOBODY 

1077
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,770
KNOWS WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. 

1078
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,640
AND THEY TALK ABOUT 

1079
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,674
CONFISCATING THE GUNS, THEY 

1080
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,377
TALK ABOUT PASSING NEW LAWS TO 

1081
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,145
INCREASE PENALTIES FOR THOSE 

1082
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:17,281
HOLDING ILLEGAL WEAPONS. 

1083
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,350
IT IS ANYBODY'S GUESS WHICH 

1084
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,784
THING WILL ACTUALLY STRIKE A 

1085
00:40:20,784 --> 00:40:23,186
BLOW AGAINST THE VIOLENCE. 

1086
00:40:23,186 --> 00:40:25,890
>> INDEED. 

1087
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,124
IT IS DISTURBING WHEN YOU HEAR 

1088
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:27,925
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. 

1089
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:31,896
IT IS GOOD TO POINT OUT THAT IT 

1090
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,897
ISN'T JUST A FEW DISTRICTS. 

1091
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,598
IN FACT, MOST OF CHICAGO IS 

1092
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,268
DOING WELL. 

1093
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,937
AND IT SORT OF BOGGLES THE MIND 

1094
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:44,375
WITH SO FEW AREAS TO FOCUS ON, 

1095
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:47,344
WHY WE CAN'T FIGURE THIS OUT. 

1096
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:48,345
CERTAINLY THERE IS A LOT OF 

1097
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:48,645
ATTENTION. 

1098
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:51,015
>> Reporter: YOU CAN OVERLAY 

1099
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:56,053
STATISTICS ON THOSE AREAS. 

1100
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:56,586
UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS, 

1101
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:58,923
POVERTY, POOR EDUCATION, 

1102
00:40:58,923 --> 00:40:59,857
ILLEGITIMACY, ON THOSE 

1103
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,493
NEIGHBORHOODS, AND THAT'S HOW 

1104
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:03,160
YOU IDENTIFY THE NEIGHBORHOODS. 

1105
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,961
THE REST OF THE CITYIS PRETTY 

1106
00:41:04,961 --> 00:41:05,362
GOOD. 

1107
