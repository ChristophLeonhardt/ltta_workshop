1
00:00:12,927 --> 00:00:14,562
SHOULD STEP UP AND DISMISS THE

2
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:15,162
ENTIRE INVESTIGATION.

3
00:00:15,162 --> 00:00:16,597
AND THE JUDGE ALSO HAS A RIGHT

4
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:17,298
TO DETERMINE.

5
00:00:17,298 --> 00:00:18,733
THEY WENT BEYOND THAT.

6
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:21,802
EVEN IF ROSENSTEIN INTENDED TO

7
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:22,637
GIVE IT TO THEM.

8
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:24,639
HE HAS A RIGHT TO DETERMINE THAT

9
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:25,940
BY GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT THEY

10
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,441
HAVE FAINTLY TAINTED THIS CASE.

11
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:30,411
>> THAT WAS RUDY GIULIANI, PART

12
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:32,213
OF THE PRESIDENT'S LEGAL TEAM

13
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:34,515
WEIGHING IN ON THE JUDGE

14
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:36,484
OVERSEEING PAUL MAN FOT'S CASE.

15
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:39,587
WHO RECENTLY LAID INTO MULLER'S

16
00:00:39,587 --> 00:00:41,889
SPECIAL COUNT

17
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:42,823
SPECIAL COUNSEL, ACCUSING THEM

18
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,125
OF TARGETING THE PRESIDENT.

19
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,893
OUR NEXT GUEST AGREES ADDING

20
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:48,362
IT'S TIME FOR MUELLER TO WRAP UP

21
00:00:48,362 --> 00:00:51,999
THE PROBE ONCE AND FOR ALL.

22
00:00:51,999 --> 00:00:54,402
ROBERT CHARLES SERVED AS

23
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:56,003
ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE

24
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:57,138
UNDER GEORGE W. BUSH.

25
00:00:57,138 --> 00:00:58,039
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,840
YOU SAY IT'S TIME TO WRAP UP THE

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,141
PROBE.

28
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,542
HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN AND WHAT

29
00:01:01,542 --> 00:01:02,843
CAN BE DONE TO FORCE THAT HAND.

30
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:06,781
>> A GREAT QUESTION AND I THINK

31
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:07,915
MR. GIULIANA IS RIGHT IN

32
00:01:07,915 --> 00:01:08,516
EVERYTHING HE SAID.

33
00:01:08,516 --> 00:01:10,084
I WOULD FOCUS THE ATTENTION

34
00:01:10,084 --> 00:01:11,152
RIGHT NOW ON CONGRESS BECAUSE

35
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:13,220
THERE IS A REQUEST PRESENTLY

36
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,956
PENDING THAT MR. ROSENSTEIN HAS

37
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,324
NOT HONORED AND THAT IS A

38
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:18,092
REQUEST FOR THE FUEL SCOPE MEMO

39
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:19,460
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE AMERICAN

40
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,494
PEOPLE AND THE UNITED STATES

41
00:01:20,494 --> 00:01:23,197
CONGRESS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS

42
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:24,165
INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY WAS

43
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:24,966
ALLOWED TO DO.

44
00:01:24,966 --> 00:01:28,202
THE REMARKABLE PART HONESTLY IS

45
00:01:28,202 --> 00:01:30,605
THAT THIS INQUIRY WHICH CONGRESS

46
00:01:30,605 --> 00:01:33,474
HAS MADE HAS BEEN REBUTTED BY

47
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:34,275
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO

48
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:36,010
SAYS HE'S BEEN EXTORTED BY

49
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:36,377
CONGRESS.

50
00:01:36,377 --> 00:01:37,878
AND THAT'S QUITE REMARKABLE IN

51
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:40,915
THE CONTEXT OF CONGRESSIONAL

52
00:01:40,915 --> 00:01:42,450
OVERSIGHT POWER PS THERE ARE SIX

53
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,251
PROVISIONS IN THE CONSTITUTION,

54
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:46,287
18 STATUTES THAT VALIDATE THIS

55
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:46,621
REQUEST.

56
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:48,389
TO ME IT'S VERY SURPRISING MORE

57
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:51,158
THAN ANYTHING ELSE WHY THE

58
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:52,627
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, WHICH

59
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:55,262
INCIDENTALLY HE'S BLOCKING THE

60
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:56,564
PRODUCTION OF THIS DOCUMENT,

61
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:57,565
WHICH MAY BE LAW ENFORCEMENT

62
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:59,200
SENSITIVE BUT THEY'RE FULLY

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,835
ENTITLED TO GET IT UNDER THE LAW

64
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:01,836
OF THE LAND.

65
00:02:01,836 --> 00:02:02,937
IT'S THE EXACT SAME DOCUMENT

66
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:04,372
THAT THE JUDGE IN VIRGINIA IS

67
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:05,439
TRYING TO GET.

68
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,375
TO WRAP THIS WHOLE THING UP, YOU

69
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,476
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS

70
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:09,443
WHOLE THING IS.

71
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:10,711
>> WELL EXACTLY.

72
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,079
>> AND THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO

73
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:12,513
GET AT IT.

74
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:15,716
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SCOPE

75
00:02:15,716 --> 00:02:17,218
MEMO WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

76
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:19,220
PRODUCED BY ROD ROSENSTEIN WHICH

77
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,522
GIVES THE AUTHORITY FOR BOB

78
00:02:21,522 --> 00:02:23,157
MUELLER, HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN AND

79
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:24,558
CANNOT INVESTIGATE.

80
00:02:24,558 --> 00:02:26,394
AND AS JUDGE T.S. ELLIS IS

81
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:27,595
REVIEWING THE CASE IN FRONT OF

82
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:30,231
HIM, HE WANTS TO KNOW IF THE

83
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,666
CHARGES BEING BROUGHT AGAINST

84
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,300
PAUL MANAFORT ARE WITHIN THE

85
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,269
GUIDELINES AND RIGHT NOW HE

86
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:36,837
CAN'T SEE THAT UNREDACTED.

87
00:02:36,837 --> 00:02:39,840
>> IN 12 DAYS WE'LL KNOW WHETHER

88
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,875
HE GETS THE MEMO.

89
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:42,610
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS HAS

90
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,945
AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO THAT MEMO.

91
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:48,616
THEY HAVE SUBPOENA POWER,

92
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:50,584
IMPEACHMENT POWER OVER

93
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:51,986
HIGH-RANKING OFFICIALS, POWER OF

94
00:02:51,986 --> 00:02:52,386
CONTEMPT.

95
00:02:52,386 --> 00:02:53,688
ULTIMATELY IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

96
00:02:53,688 --> 00:02:55,856
FOR THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

97
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:57,591
GENERAL, A VERY SMART GUY, NOT

98
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,326
TO SIT BACK LOOK AT THIS --

99
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,629
FRANKLY START WITH THE OVERSIGHT

100
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:02,396
MANUAL.

101
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:04,632
EVERY AMERICAN CAN GOOGLE THE

102
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:07,768
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICES

103
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:08,269
OVERSIGHT MANUAL.

104
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,005
150 PAGES OF CASE LAW.

105
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:15,276
MAKES CRYSTAL CLOO

106
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:15,309
MAKES CRYSTAL CLEO

107
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:15,943
MAKES CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT

108
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:17,478
CONGRESS HAS THE RIGHT TO THE

109
00:03:17,478 --> 00:03:17,845
DOCUMENT.

110
00:03:17,845 --> 00:03:19,013
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ROD

111
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:20,281
ROSENSTEIN IS CONFLICTED?

112
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:21,949
HE'S THE ONE THAT HELPED

113
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:23,217
RECOMMEND THAT COMEY NO LONGER

114
00:03:23,217 --> 00:03:24,485
BE THE FBI DIRECTOR.

115
00:03:24,485 --> 00:03:26,854
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SUGGESTING

116
00:03:26,854 --> 00:03:28,823
HE'S JUST TOO INVOLVED TO BE A

117
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:31,792
FAIR ASH TORE

118
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:31,826
FAIR ARB TORE

119
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:31,859
FAIR ARBITORE

120
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:32,259
FAIR ARBITERE

121
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:33,394
FAIR ARBITER OF WHAT BOB MUELLER

122
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:34,962
CAN AND CANNOT DO?

123
00:03:34,962 --> 00:03:37,531
>> HE'S IN AN AWKWARD POSITION.

124
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,799
HE'S A SMART GUY.

125
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,135
HE HAS A GAP IN HIS

126
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:43,471
UNDERSTANDING AND THAT MAY BE

127
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:44,071
OVERSIGHT.

128
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:46,073
HE'S RESPONDING ON MULTIPLE

129
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:46,974
FRONT TO CRITICISM.

130
00:03:46,974 --> 00:03:48,342
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT

131
00:03:48,342 --> 00:03:50,411
LOOKS LIKE HE'S CONFLICTED.

132
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,912
AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO ASK

133
00:03:51,912 --> 00:03:52,813
YOURSELF WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING

134
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:54,749
TO DO INSTEAD OF WHAT'S THE

135
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:56,383
POLITICALLY RIGHT THING TO DO OR

136
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,352
WHAT WILL COVER MUELLER'S

137
00:03:58,352 --> 00:03:59,120
INVESTIGATION FOR SOME

138
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,954
ADDITIONAL PERIOD OF TIME.

139
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,388
YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF, IS

140
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,823
THIS THE RIGHT TIME TO WRAP IT

141
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:03,290
UP.

142
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:04,425
>> IT'S INTERESTING AS THE

143
00:04:04,425 --> 00:04:07,094
JUDGES POINT OUT, AS T.S. ELLIS

144
00:04:07,094 --> 00:04:08,229
SAID, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE

145
00:04:08,229 --> 00:00:00,000
FIGHTING FOR PROSECUTION OR
