here's the young turks at politican 2018 if you want to catch us every day become a member to uit calm slice join you to have a discussion on how the effort in this country today all right so wait introductions here first of all to my far right we talked of it young turks network that is luckily our resellers as a former state representative software on now at the end there we have thrown in milano a NGO sensor on youtube and then it's my left yeah wire and his lovely an early-bird founder so this brain this obsession for a second here we obviously live in very polarized science say our political rhetoric is advice enough in probably in our lifetimes and just to put a finer point on the level of polarization today studies have shown that the levels of the partisanship partisan polarization Congress are the widest they've been since end of the briefing obstruction and you only have to analyze to this country to see just how the body of the sponsor is I think it might be that partisanship is really passed by the problem today so I open the panel we talk about you know how we do worse the political divide any need environment works very difficult to do it and I'm involved our panelists here are on the cutting edge of new media and if we're really going to be on the folks here to figure out how we can create anymore construct the political dialogue and so I actually want to serve the party because you have transitions from a government role and served in the state legislature South Carolina you were the nominee got America in 2014 2014 and it's the business of trying to warm legislation and work with both Democrats and Republicans in the legislature and then in transition to a commentator world I've seen a number of platforms but it's more about that transitioning that process and the changes and incentives that you found it in terms of the type of political dialogue that would get work for being here I was very young but I firmly believe that we're not generation of tomorrow with a degeneration of now in so I encourage everyone here when I was 21 years old I am a photographer officer and it's finally a to you though and in office for 26 years since 2006 the community flag like the pitch from the United States and you say regardless of how someone looks regardless of where someone came from who's it of code I always hate me with benefit of area community and I think if we start there we meet people where they are we can find issues that all of us can agree that probably to my left and my right I can honestly say that if we would have put forth an idea by making sure that we think redistricting which the reason that we're so polarized today independent ignitions statewide but I'm actually these two agree on that and push you to the state but right now but it seems those type of bold steps it takes people not be any part of any differences reality of where we are in this country I told me we made a lot of progress what you still got a ways to go yeah well just pick up on that issue a gerrymandering and the importance of our generation a lot of people don't realize this but at the state level Iowa's here I run a nonpartisan organization called millennium last project we were elected officials across the aisle and it was the young lawmakers in Ohio who pushed a bipartisan plan to put it in place reducing the reform in Ohio to get rid of the partisan gerrymandering an acid why the particles for the buggers disappeared it would have seventy five percent of the vote and I think that is something to sort opportunity our generation has different sense of the old advice that have been holding our country back the looking for when I solving the problem is consensus among college students in the government that is run by lawyers lobbyists all connected people around the 1970 see our argument is well that government has been bought and it's worse and worse government and that's obviously were great so the broad-based question here over the last 3040 years is why has the wealth power money and influence concentrated around our nation's capital what may create they create nothing they create access to the wealthiest counties in America used to be around the Detroit Michigan now developing economies America in DC where you're literally awarded and how close you are to the power and if we're have to get away from that I think there are some solutions that I would actually be very fair math don't work but I think our generation is looking for a series of policies ideas that I think that years for the debates and 11 trade all of our principles time again we're not going to be able to increase freedom and government and by the new score of lobbyists and insiders yeah that's a great point and totally on that medal over to Kyle here because we made the point about this widening gap between you know Washington DC and the rest of the country not only in terms of power but also in terms of now income and I've heard this divided America reframes particularly after I know okay so we were talking about the incentives involved in having an online TV show and I personally struggle with the incentives on social media YouTube because the most inflammatory rhetoric gets the most views most retweets you know those you know followers and so from your perspective the conversation getting involved in these issues and you know my hope is if they see something that's made a little bit of cassation I agree with purposely provocative right well see more about that you've seen from your experience well what I find is an equal reward on petition audiences reward authenticity you cannot do something I love I love I love the partnership I research I love it I don't want I'm voting who I'm voting for in the 93 supports one of the main complaints political scientists with the parties were a distinguished you have issues like taxes to death whatever people had an affair poison now I'm on all of the decisions on the veteran on the role of governments so show us someone life on marriage on death I that kind of an eyelid it gives me a choice on the movement which is found in this house but never wrong Reagan savor the flavor when when one party has doctors saying that we should go Republican phones where their children asleep we should physically around them though there's some harsh rhetoric for a little men of my age range those are not sending and that's that's my American sequel to my out of time that cellar all the reasons all the reasons both to we win but I agree that the question life is probably just measure yes like like for example very very much we it is very easy to see in a bad way but didn't even ask for that economy had a pro-life pro-choice doesn't even exfoliate hastily arranged to political peace yes right and talked about we can talk about how we make sure that people wanna adoption that about a disease not breathe you know talk about issues what I did was Chris Rock point about so we have that moment embarrasses us the area of all in rainfall the crying reduce the prison population and reduce mandatory minimum sentences very like I want to get your response that deep do you agree with similar voices at Norquist and Koch brothers who who want to reduce the huge right now is the last gasp people who deserved our deserve deserve me like and was wrong and I'm very pleased that we received the question pretty important more broadly when the president from C said long word c7 was we this was but funding them in the arms we want and we get to only allow you know we're talking about in the headlines the fact is still need that atomize we live in a very broken political system and I'm going to get some of those incentives primarily because we don't give it enough air time to be honest sexy I think it's very important you want to bring in a department because because it's work on the Obama campaign 2008 and I think the last time there was an interest in trying to transcend the divide was that camp and and Obama's famous words the 2004 was out there was kind of a liberal America it was not a conservative America there's the United States America and then that ended presidency vice news to this Rick back memory of somebody and they asked well why and he said well that hasn't worked out so well did it I'm thinking wait hold on that was a center for the premise of why you know why he ran and why he got elected so I don't want to talk too much I'll lay over his words for destruction I'm gonna get one layer deeper there's no 100 the processes you said cause that mission to fail so very good freshmen see well I mean I've been from economic recession yesterday left we have a tension about those policies issues and so it's pretty good we don't make it out of there the Delta where you want to go issues that I give credit for sort of a back end way that we are now actually having an exception about robustly is issuing breaks it stationers times together we never we never had they deny fine in houses on death row must reform without her father a family we had to literally live on on welfare for a period of time but the fact that my father had fun being active 100 years ago this is one generation and it's the great piece in the Atlantic all the first white president in talking about the ink that I think 22 when this will be able to target minority country and we'll be dealing with it now we need more it's playing on now we wouldn't be having this time is we're having founders so that's a part of the reason I believe we had right all right we have some questions here we won't have time to get to everyone but we hope to get a few I say when we're paying they're easy a question market and please evil drug war they're totally ruining there's some other things in and that's you know time it's time when we get along my answer to that is very simple way we do agree we need to get along and we need to work together on those issues I have no problem doing that but where are we going to read let's argue but I think there's things we can agree on instead of what papers would have lend itself to tearing and decentralisation power and so the diffusion power and representation not part of the thing cloud thing I think very go to present with a direct national vote will see and do not forget No so we had our first we're constitutional republic but we're also literally a representative democracy and people should be power are the most about fewer votes issues very slices do you really believe that gravity next you want me to we want me to answer do I believe that young black men wanna you know actually read into the question is yes they actually read but it's not that it's not a big deal to be a black kid really bulk so I don't want to I think the only thing I'm gonna grab right now as you can tell at times ei is greed another time little pointer grinning and you know the other point of time senator course is that I I said that a lot of battle comes to campaign rhetoric for example we would bastion after every destroying you know working people in this country and we City me to stop it interest rate heels and I think that the way you lose that by by again being issued riveted when your issues where you will find points agreement where as opposed to partisan hack your do you probably yes we'd love to have an amateur sort of white woman our large problem and it's part of that and so I think we have you know the less for European programs they're more likely to go to school hungry they're more likely to have issues I'm not pretty but it races Harvard has got a different gravy sale for Asian American students burst of laxative Ursa white Syrian it is harder to get into Ivy League schools as an asian-american student than any other eraser boxes of each other that it's curable racism that have different levels or that happens to be the richest group in America American bases America and they learned in 1940's yet over the last time you eight years they did they made evacuate legislative job and get married before yet this they've done those things over the last sixty years now we're punishing them in the college division so we need to see though because actually depends on which informations they actually more or talking about the elves you program today and you evil eyes equalizes well or is income earning with the Commonwealth so you're looking at okay when after Republican Party Tennessee I think understanding perhaps you can perhaps you can view on the death penalty's if you're talking about a Catholic question this is an evening with to my theology although there's now some question about that raised by the president think of Christ on earth but we another there are reasons you know we obviously throughout Scripture as always have some authority has right to condemn people and many others to church but it's autistic air-ride also wrote atlas okay why should we do it it's because justice is very important that were there were bad incentives that go down the line when you stop punishing people for a ascribes it's very easy to sit here and say oh I oppose the death penalty for all cases what about some awful terrorist who killed 3,000 people one sunny morning what about some money it's awful crimes rape murder why wouldn't we attack those teeth why wouldn't we with government power domestically for nationals then I think we should be protecting the lively unborn even alive for the people that I've got for reading / if eclis pain is France that obviously the light of day but I think we have conservatives need to be consistent in how we say well we should be protecting life all people no matter how difficult it might be say yes we want to see that a lively conversation and I think with two points first on the topic of the political business with Warren and look to whether George Washington said in a servo in these times of extreme partisanship our country become vulnerable to foreign aggression influence and creates fertile ground for returning tendencies and I think these political divisions Academy our country is really the challenge over time and it's not to say that we all need time but we need to have better organs we have better conversations and that's why I'm grateful for panelists here and the last I'll say that amazing optimistic it's when you look at the millennial demographic right now if you look at the data we tend to a much more issue focus than a party focus and we can have more of a dialogue around that
