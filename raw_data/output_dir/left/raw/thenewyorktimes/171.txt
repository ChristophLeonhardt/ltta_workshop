1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:06,826
This is Stephon Clark, lying
on the ground, motionless

2
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:08,700
after two Sacramento
police officers shot him

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,470
seven times.

4
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:14,520
He was a 22-year-old father of
two boys. An unarmed black man.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,620
Killed in his own backyard.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,670
And it all happened
in just 23 seconds.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,530
We’re going to break
down those 23 seconds

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,170
and look at five
critical moments.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,060
Our frame-by-frame
analysis reveals

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,990
a series of split-second
decisions and errors,

11
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,290
and examines how they
ended in Clark’s death.

12
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:34,295
A warning: It can be hard to watch.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,589
First, let’s play the whole
encounter. Pay attention

14
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:39,925
to how quickly it escalates.

15
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,760
It all starts earlier
around 9:10 p.m.,

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,580
when a resident
calls 911 and reports

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,280
that someone is
vandalizing cars.

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,100
Then, 16 minutes later,
a police helicopter

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,530
spots a suspect.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,580
This is Stephon Clark.

21
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,850
The police footage doesn’t
show Clark break a window.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,980
But the police say they
believe he was responsible

23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,590
for the reported vandalism.

24
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,710
Clark jumps a
fence into this yard.

25
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,330
He lived here with
his grandmother,

26
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,186
although there’s no
reason to think that

27
00:01:47,186 --> 00:01:49,450
the police knew this.

28
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,090
Moments later, we see two
police officers approach

29
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,710
the front of the house.

30
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,120
Police have not confirmed
the officers’ identities,

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,090
so we’ll call them
Officer 1 and Officer 2.

32
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,050
The helicopter guides
them toward Clark.

33
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,130
Officer 1 has his gun drawn
before he encounters Clark.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,650
We slowed down and
brightened this clip

35
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,640
to see it more clearly.

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,680
This is just before
the officer first shouts,

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,090
starting the
crucial 23 seconds

38
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,170
as the officers begin pursuit.

39
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,090
Clark is standing along
the side of the house,

40
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,520
while the officers
are at the front.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,270
Officer 1 sees
Clark and shouts.

42
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,910
Clark runs farther
into his backyard.

43
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,160
He moves under a covered
patio and stays there

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,420
for the next 13 seconds.

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,560
The officers chase Clark and
run around a blind corner,

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
breathing hard.

47
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,830
Their speed may
have robbed them

48
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,324
of a chance to de-escalate
the situation from a safe spot,

49
00:02:46,324 --> 00:02:47,960
which would be
in line with

50
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,817
their department’s 
instructions.

51
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:51,150
The chaos of the
full-on pursuit

52
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,630
could have been a factor
in the next critical moment,

53
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,030
when one of the officers
mistakenly thinks

54
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,460
that Clark has a weapon.

55
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,990
Officer 1 is now about
40 feet away from Clark.

56
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,830
We’ll freeze on this frame.

57
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,230
It’s difficult to see,
but right here,

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,990
this is Stephon Clark
facing Officer 1.

59
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,300
We can tell he’s stopped
and facing the officer,

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,520
but we can’t see much
else, including whether

61
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,680
he has anything in his hands.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,880
Here’s the moment from the
helicopter’s perspective.

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,340
Less than two seconds after
coming around the corner,

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,580
Officer 1 shouts
the word “Gun.”

65
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,010
So, why in that brief
moment did the officer

66
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,790
conclude that Clark, who
was unarmed, had a gun?

67
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,200
We don’t know.

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,210
Both officers backtracked
behind the corner

69
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,010
and then looked
back around it.

70
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,680
Officer 1 again concludes
that Clark is armed.

71
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,570
And immediately after that,
his partner decides to fire.

72
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,350
Why? Possibly because he
saw Clark’s movements.

73
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,460
Remember, Clark
had been stopped,

74
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,980
but as the officers retreat,
he begins moving

75
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,210
in their direction.

76
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,550
When they look around
the corner again,

77
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,880
he’s closer, around 25
feet away from the officers

78
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,975
and continuing to move.

79
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:02,220
Clark is stepping through
a narrow space

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,270
between a picnic table
and the house, likely turned

81
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,009
and not directly
facing the officers.

82
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:09,440
We drew this
conclusion in part

83
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,050
by comparing the body camera
to this picture of Clark

84
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,670
from earlier in the same day.

85
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,860
Notice the pants
with white stripes —

86
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,880
the same ones seen
in the body camera.

87
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,610
But nothing in the
videos can tell us

88
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,180
why Clark moved.

89
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,120
Overhead from the helicopter
we see him as well.

90
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,430
That small cluster
of white pixels.

91
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,170
That’s all we can see of
Clark before shots are fired.

92
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,270
Less than a second
after Officer 1 called

93
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:38,540
out a gun for the
second time, Officer 2

94
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:41,360
fires the first series
of five bullets.

95
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,460
After a short
pause, both officers

96
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,220
shoot a combined
15 more times.

97
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:51,330
Let’s look at that again
from the helicopter.

98
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,670
The first volley is fired

99
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,120
while Clark stands.

100
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,650
He falls to his
hands and knees.

101
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,880
He’s still moving as the
second round of shots begins,

102
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,910
and then, by the
time it’s over,

103
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,550
he’s motionless.

104
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,680
So, which shots killed Clark?

105
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,010
The ones fired while
he was standing

106
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,780
or those fired while
he was on the ground?

107
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,520
In early May, the
Sacramento County coroner

108
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,420
released its autopsy report,

109
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,110
concluding that Clark was shot
seven times.

110
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,620
By combining the report 
with our analysis

111
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,050
we determined that Clark
was struck in his left leg

112
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,280
while still standing,

113
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
a non-lethal shot.

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,410
He was also struck
six more times,

115
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,830
all on the right side
and back.

116
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,240
These shots broke his ribs,
fractured his spine,

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,980
lacerated his heart,
perforated his lungs

118
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,230
and killed him.

119
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,390
Given Clark’s position,
orientation and movement,

120
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,160
these last six shots
almost certainly

121
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,910
hit Clark while he was falling
or lying on the ground.

122
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,460
We don’t know exactly how
long it took these wounds

123
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,060
to kill Clark, but we
do know that there

124
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,420
was a significant delay before
any medical aid was given.

125
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,830
“Show me your hands.”

126
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,065
“Let’s see your hands.”

127
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,740
After they stopped firing,

128
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,600
the officers don’t
approach Clark.

129
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
They talk to either each other
or to Clark’s unresponsive body,

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,220
which they still consider
a threat.

131
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,220
“You all right, you hit?”
“Yeah, I’m good.”

132
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,980
Two minutes after the shooting,
other officers arrive.

133
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,440
“You can’t see his
hands, right?”

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,640
The police discuss using
a body bunker, a shield

135
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,380
to protect themselves
from gunfire.

136
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,330
“Three-Sam-five 
if you can head this way,

137
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,630
we could use a body bunker
before we detain him.”

138
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,810
Almost three minutes
after the last shot,

139
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,450
the police identify themselves
for the first time.

140
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,730
“Hey, can you hear us?”

141
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,850
“Police Department,
can you hear us?”

142
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,030
“We need to know 
if you’re OK.

143
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,080
We need to get you
medics, but we can’t

144
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,180
go over to get you help
unless we know

145
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,220
you don’t have a weapon.”

146
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,100
Officer 1 describes the
moment when they fired.

147
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,030
“He came up and then he, he kind
of approached us hands out.

148
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,050
And then, fell down.”

149
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,550
Four minutes and 50 seconds
after the shooting,

150
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,500
officers approach Clark.

151
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,780
“One of you guys want to go hands,
cover ’em, I — oh, fuck.”

152
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,330
They handcuff him,
which is a standard practice.

153
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,630
And when they roll him
over, his cellphone

154
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,980
is lying under his body.

155
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,020
This suggests a
possibility: that Clark

156
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,560
had the phone in his hand

157
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,090
and that’s what the
officers mistook for a gun.

158
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,280
The police now have the
phone but have not said

159
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,640
whether he was recording.

160
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,060
“Give me a light, 
we’ll start CPR.”

161
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:26,760
“All right.”

162
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,980
Six minutes after the
last bullet was fired,

163
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,340
officers not involved in
the shooting give first aid.

164
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,310
Clark is pronounced
dead at the scene.

165
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:42,050
Officers 1 and 2 step away
and mute their cameras.

166
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,350
“Hey, mute.”

167
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,320
We can no longer hear what
they’re discussing.

168
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,630
Shortly after 
the shooting,

169
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,130
the Sacramento
Police Department

170
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:50,810
updated its guidelines.

171
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,270
Officers are now required
to record why they mute

172
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,290
or turn off their cameras.

173
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:57,680
The officers were placed on
paid administrative leave

174
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,480
and then returned 
to desk duty on April 9.

175
00:08:00,480 --> 00:00:00,000
And the investigation
is ongoing.
