it was a race that shouldn't have been closed at all and that makes Connor Lam the new hope of the Democratic Party it took a little longer than we thought but we did it you did it you did it in a nail-biter the young charismatic former Marine and Republican state legislator Rick ciccone finished in a near dead heat in a special election for a u.s. congressional seat in Pennsylvania that traditionally leans Republican then we're gonna keep fighting and don't give up and we'll keep it up that has Democrats believing they can retake Congress with an NG trump bump Donald Trump won the district by about 20 percentage points in 2016 analysts say this election could be a sign of things to come this really will be seen as a referendum on Donald Trump if Democrats are going to take are going to take that as an indication an early indication that the November results could be very good for them and they're going to believe that they have a real chance of taking a majority in the House of Representatives late in the campaign Ciccone reached out to his party's president for health the president hoping to keep Congress Republican reached back go out and vote on Tuesday for Rick ciccone the president even dispatched his son Donald Trump jr. hoping to push Taccone ahead he's gonna support the things that my father's doing he had a real conservative who's gonna fight for America push through this agenda but here in steel and coal country lamb appealed to many of the union workers and blue-collar Democrats who supported Trump two years ago many are now disillusioned despite the protective steel tariffs Trump hoped would keep them voting Republican it's heartbreaking because I voted for Trump we all had hopes that he would change everything but I guess we were wrong or maybe we're wrong right now I don't know Democrats hope to make more gains like they have in Pennsylvania but that will depend on whether they can run electoral II appealing candidates like Lam and whether they continue to face an unpopular president John Hendren al Jazeera Washington
