although in welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle this is the last edition of crosstalk for the year and we're doing something different we answer questions from you our viewers crosstalking the year that was I'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Victor Levesque he is a political analyst as well as a leading expert at the Centre for actual politics and we have Dimitri Babak he is a political analyst with Sputnik international all right gentlemen crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate it before we go to our our viewers questions I'd like each one of you maybe I will start here to kind of sum up some of the most important things that happened in the last 12 months and I think I'm going to kind of end the year on kind of a dramatic note I think we face in the United States a constitutional crisis it's really very much coming to a head we have Congress that is not answering demands or we have a Department of Justice and the FBI they're not answering demands from Congress we see an outright media war depending on what station you look at you could be looking at a very different country and I'm looking at like Fox versus like CNN very different views of the world it's getting to a critical point it didn't happen in 2017 I think it's gonna happen in 2018 what's your major takeaway Victor the game-changer in 2017 is the victory by Russia Syria and their allies against terrorist organizations that operated in Syria for years against Isis against a noose against other others and this is really a game changer not just for Syria but for the Middle East as a whole but I don't think it's over yet mm okay but it's a very very major step it's a major setback for the United States and their allies mark a big take away from the viewpoint of living in Russia the Russian media and and perhaps the alt media the left in the US this has been a year under siege a year of constantly having to battle back a neo McCarthyite narrative that not only intends to target Trump but intends to silence voices of opposition with the left media Syria as well it's far from over but at least regime change is off the table but we have a whole new Middle East destabilization with Trump playing James in declaring Jerusalem to be able to talk about with our viewer viewers questions diamond go ahead I think 2017 was year a year of inconclusive endings to the crisis I think in Syria okay the the UK and France dropped for the moment the demand or asset to go but the United States remains there so the war is not over yet unfortunately but the crisis is over they say you know it seems to me in a more end on that before we go to the questions there seems to be a crisis of leadership I mean as I was going to the studio here we have Rick's Rex Tillerson flip-flopping again on Assad I mean if we go back and forth like that's why I say it's in conclusion conclusion I agree with you all right let's go to the first question from one of our viewers here my question is what exactly is the deep state and who's in it Victor and it's a good question or a deep state is in the Nexus of the US special services of the u.s. permanent political bureaucracy and the mass media that serves them and essentially it performs it controls the daily functioning of the nation while the president does his own thing you know what's really interesting about this term mark I think he pointed it out I think it was a year ago almost exactly that we started talking about how the New York Times uses the term deep state that never was you in circulation in in the mass media and now it's you know part somebody else so somebody else had a deep state yeah okay so there's a long history of talking about the deep state academically in the u.s. back to Eisenhower warning about the military-industrial complex but we have had a recent rejuvenation of it and the deep state has become active something it's not always at that because opposed to because Trump challenged the deep States establishment foreign policy and if we're talking about specific people we need to take a look it is difficult because if we knew who specifically is leaking and disrupting policy they'd be in jail Michael Morell the former acting director of the CIA a Clinton surrogate and the one who infamously said to Charlie Rose the the US needs to start killing more Russians and Iranians that's like the difference is here the deep state is where they're not supposed to be political they're not supposed to be active and now we have high government officials in the FBI looking for insurance policies to make sure their views come i think the deep state acts according to the ultra liberal globalist ideology it's it's they're armed armed wing as a communist you know where weaponized wing which is not always seen but you know it relies on the ultra liberal ideology which which signifies that any cruelty NUI is justified if it promotes the so-called Western values not supposed to be sane but it certainly felt when they want to you issues that democracy is not just a facade in the United States I would say we go it's a fraud that disturbance our second question let's go to the second question here what is the future with Ukraine is their Russian plan or shall some parts of Ukraine be like Somalia work yeah well there's a lot of discussion that Putin had a cunning plan at one point but I don't know if it's been so cunning what we have is a frozen conflict and I think we may see some some escalation you know we say it frozen conflict there were four hundred and fifty to civilian deaths in the last year in done boss and that was but unfortunately the Russian government probably should have acted more proactively when this West back pushed first overthrew the government and seized power I warned about it at the time they did not now there is really no military solution and that the Kremlin is basically hoping that over time the corruption the unpopularity of this regime if it helps bring it down to the next question in 2018 we know now that lethal weapons are being sold to the Ukrainian regime and that's that's going to make this conflict but that's not for me well nothing well now it's official powers go ahead believe it or not Russia considers Ukraine an independent state so there was no Russian plan for Ukraine there was no you say the u.s. considers independence independence there's no such thing as independent states when it comes to the view of Washington either you're under their heel or you're an in-between but probably that was indeed a mistake here I agree with mark Russia had no plan for Ukraine it hoped that common sense would prevail first it hoped that there would be because criticism of Russian foreign policies it helps for reason absolutely professional talkers third question what is the future of the Middle East may look like next year with Syria ending but Yemen and Lebanon continuing in the struggle and what might we see as actual policy in response to the Jerusalem decision okay so the Jerusalem decision by the Tramp administration actually gives opportunity to Moscow to Russia to become a much more active negotiator in the arab-israeli conflict and Russia is also going to be much more active in discussions between Tehran and Riyadh it is no surprise that for the first time the king of Saudi Arabia came to Moscow to meet with Fatima Putin in the Kremlin and now Russia is going to be much more active in the region it's really America's foreign policy is destructive it's really interesting that you know the money picture is absolutely right is that you know it's because of the failed of proactive policies of Washington and his client states that actually open creates openings for for Moscow and Tehran go ahead yeah first of all Syria is not over Libya is not over and Yemen is not over and none of them will be over next year either but at least with Syria now there is a lie in the funnel yeah the US has there's a lot of talk that Donald Trump has forfeited control of the Middle East to Russia by not being proactive and they said they said it's completely nonsense the u.s. is constant at the US and Saudi Arabia blowback against their repeated regime change and meddling in the region has hit them again and again and again attempts to curtail Iranian influence helps grow Russian and Iranian influence if there's any obligation of responsibility it's it's Donald Trump over relying upon tel-aviv and we are well that's true but I think coming back to the results of the I think one of the main events was this trilateral meeting of the presidents of Russia Turkey and Iran that's a new juxtaposition of forces that is going to determine 2018 it's not going to be our versus Sunni it's not going to be a pro-american versatile anti-american is going to be sovereign states against the Western client well God needs to be reminded of that because he just called the President of Syria a terrorist again the other day for that you know todai-ji politics is not about and it has never been about morality or about this yes it is it is a an art of finding common ground with other nations and and using those unions those alliances against against other sales so Turkey today is in a position it has not been in for the last 50 years a pollutant today turkey has a much tougher relationship with Washington than ever before every the post-war era so Russia again I thought it was Russia that was trying to create divisions with the NATO I guess one of their own members or do essentially it's not Russians it's not the Russians against portrait in front of a firing line in Norway it was Nita and it wasn't Russia that sponsored the coup in Turkey it was some western states and we can name we don't we don't really know what is important is that now we have sovereign states vs. US client states and this is going to continue and for Russia you know when people are esthetic about the Soviet Union that they say the surgeon was so much stronger than Russia the Soviet Union only had dependents in the in the Middle East that wanted money from us you know Egypt under Nasser and others now we have the Saudi king coming to Moscow will have the Turkish president coming to Moscow they are whatever think about them much more serious partners than the ones that we had before so from the point of view of Russia's national interest that is one of the main results of 2017 will happen after our children will continue our discussion on questions from our viewers stay with RT yes so much that Russia welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter labelled Tremont you were discussing questions from our viewers alright gentlemen let's continue with our questions from viewers here that here's the next one if you couldn't project to five or even ten years from now in retrospect what would you consider to have been the defining global event that changed the future world either for the better or worse in 2017 that event will be the greatest long-term positive or negative effect for or repercussions I think we kind of didn't talked a little bit about them right now I think what's happening is it I think deema I'm gonna go with your thread here is it it's brexit and trump that happened the year before and we're still trying to get grapple with the outcomes of those two Democratic decisions I mean democracy got in the way with the of these global elites okay I mean going into leaving this year going into next year we see Hungary and in Poland being sanctioned within the European Union because they're expressing their sovereign right I guess nobody told them when you join the EU you lose all of your sovereignty so and that's the cold reality that they're waking up to so talking about an event I wouldn't say it's an event it's a sequence of event that you juxtaposed like Raul Castro said he would step down next year there will be another person running Cuba you have you got enough not challenging Putin anymore there is a much more serious candidate now challenging him at the election you have Poland and Hungary basically opposing the EU you know with their elected governments on the other side you have Artie been declared the foreign agent in the United States you have the French having a president for whom and minority voted you know someone who wasn't wanted by the majority of the French and it was only thanks to manipulations that he became the president you have the longest post-war political crisis in Germany where they can't form the government so you see how the East is getting more and more democratic the former socialist world whatever you call it and the West is getting less and less democratic talking about foreign agents working for spies prohibiting people to talk to foreign ambassadors now we have members of Congress a that you know every Russian is suspect I mean I mean I mean what are they supposed to do wear some kind of a red star on their on their sleeves to mark posts that they thought were somehow related to Russia but then I guess too many people actually wanted to read those posts to see what it's all about and then Facebook stopped marking them so because to not to attract attention but really we are in in a very special period in a period of change from Pax Americana from an America centric sole superpower world to a multipolar world so it's the end of the unipolar moment how much Washington wants to extend Pax Americana no matter what it does to to prolong its period of global dominance the dominance is going to weigh day by day Marklin the same thing can be said about the monopoly that the mainstream media had for decades that's being broken up the fact that we're sitting here talking right now and viewers are watching us that monopoly continued to be broken in 2017 yeah but there's a lot of pushback reticulata support with with declaring foreign media to be in foreign agents and then trying to attach the label to the left and the alt media the the paywalls that are going up across the the mainstream media outlets there there is a there really is an info war on the Internet although I think the common people are more the victims and then it would it's this corporate mainstream media and then stenography from the from the government that's pushing it but I agree with with Victor completely this is the year that the hegemon was challenged the hegemon was challenged at home with the election of trump and the u.s. political regime both elected and the unelected portions are at war with itself it's shaking the USS role as not the leader of the free world but as the hegemon the global leader and legitimacy at home and abroad Harold's good next question here probably the most controversial and I'm kind of curious how you guys are gonna react considering you're all men is the moral corruption of the West in the formulation of its foreign domestic social and economic policy caused by feminism I think it's caused by primitive understanding of feminism I think this year will be remembered not only because of the end of tax American but also it will be remembered in Russia for example by the attacks a media text against the women who oppose the the global dominance look at natalia poklonskaya there was a whole campaign this year i guess in the russian media in the foreign media you know nadezhda savchenko that ukrainian cuba was released and her release was demanded by all the world's media nearly step a woman mayor of an east ukrainian town is sitting in jail since 2014 simply because she participated in the referendum all the federal a very interesting case so I would say 2017 in listen the West's a war on men yes today we are talking about the war on man and yes it's not just feminism it's actually red femme it's radical feminism from the 60s and 70s that that doesn't just oppose patriarchy but once meteor but the real anti you tow peon sentiment is going to come in a few years we are actually today talking about rabbit rabbit ization a new industrial revolution and that brings the specter of a world where gender differences are not going to matter that much at all robots do not need sex and that is the real danger in the next decades ok the more there is moral corruption in the West but it doesn't come from feminism even from a few radical feminists in the later years that have gone off the ranch this show is made by women they're produced without feminism this show wouldn't be made so I've got no problems with classical feminism the rock comes from actually classical liberalism the cult of the individual and the ratification of Neil liberalism the economic system of the unfettered unregulated free market over everything the marketization the commodification of all human relations that's where the real moral decay of the West comes from okay um I I don't think we have any comments about in 2007 it was the year of the robe I'm thinking of a Harvey Weinstein and Charlie Charlie Rose did you say you're the robe the open robe I want to keep going here because I think this is a question that came from Don debar a frequent guest on this program and constant viewer he always is reminding me you know when is the program gonna be on YouTube okay will Trump be removed from office now Victor I'm gonna turn to you because I think almost every single episode you've been on a last six months you're predicting the removal of Trump from oh yes Trump will be removed from office in 2018 this is going to be his first and last new year in the Oval Office and the investigation cade by special counsel Robert Mueller is going to pressure those around him put pressure on his family members and essentially he's going to be asked to step down all right Victor one year from now we're gonna save this clip and then I'm gonna ask you to explain it or say I told you so go ahead mark Trump we don't know Trump may eventually be removed from office it most likely won't be in 2018 it will depend on how the Republicans do in the midterm elections do the main control and does Trump keep trying to push a foreign policy like they taught with Russia that's against the establishment so far it appears he's going in the opposite direction and bowing down to everything that neo-cons won at this point so I in that way he's actually giving me more but I've been saying this all along he said you know he does cave in time entirely doesn't get any kudos for it okay it only gets were no it's because the neoliberalism this postmodernist project it doesn't believe in negotiation you negotiated is called appeasement okay and then if you appease them they want more more true this is what the ideology does but I think the candidate who when you who said he wanted good relations with Russia who said that there are Russians living in Crimea and it's basically why should it be world into Ukraine that candidate has been removed from all absolutely so the candidate that was serious that was challenging mrs. Clinton that wanted to drain the swamp that candidate has been removed from office the fact that there is a person looking exactly like him sitting in the Oval Office and making some statements that is not very important was basically the DEP Trump the politician has been removed the Trump their official which may be still there the country remains terribly divided I mean we still have a lot of very deep deep red states here and this is what you know what we did actually did a program a civil war I mean I don't know to what degree it will get you know a hot day we were at warm-up but it certainly on a discursive opposing narratives that that that civil war is raging right now and I have every reason to believe it's going to continue in 2018 it is going to get even worse because these attempts to remove Trump they're going to divide the country even more you are exactly correct when you say that there is going to be there is a likelihood of a constitutional crisis Trump may attempt to fight back he may attempt to to accuse those who are trying to remove him of those misdeeds that they are guilty of and it will be very very ugly these people but these people don't they don't they have every expectation to write this president out because they believe they know what's best okay and we all know you know these federal employees the life employees the vast majority of the mark our Democrats they pay the and give time to me contribution should the Democratic candidates we're talking about again the deep state this unelected bureaucracy that continues even after every four years the the political had changes year the hill reported that for the 2016 election cycle ninety-five percent of federal workers donated the clinton that trend is only expected to continue in 2018 but relax the deep states frontmen this cabal of generals mattis McMasters Kelley they got this Trump has just about admitted that he's turned over for it and military policy to them right now he's just the Twitter and chief he's a figurehead he's something that they may find they can live with at least until the end of his regular four years twenty seconds there was an important thing that Trump did he he dumped TTIP and TPP so now it's clear that there won't be just one globalization there will be several globalization's one of them certainly centered on the united states the other one centered on China and on Russia so that is one of the main results of 2017 all right gentlemen many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and thanks to our viewers for watching us here RT this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember crosstalk rules okay now for the extended version of our program here before we continue with the questions and political potpourri as we always do in the extended version here Victor and I on our viewers know Victor and I spent Christmas night together but for reasons you might be a little surprised we were sitting in a police station how many hours we'll be there about six five or six hours well I had some of my possessions taken from me and the police had found the perpetrator within 24 hours of getting the case which I thought was really quite remarkable and I asked them what we could do for them and they just said could you mention us on your broadcast and I said Victor and I would be happy to do that many thanks to these my local police station in Moscow for a prompt resolution of this affair it was a very interesting experience I've been here for almost 20 years it just shows there's still more things that can experience in living and profession properties a personal and they were very and they were very young all of them is in very professional and they kept these and we had pizza little cold let's continue here let me go this one to you because there's something that you and Mark like to talk about you was the u.s. withdrew from the Paris climate deal why couldn't Trump just wait until the end of his term and watch his European partners inability to fulfill the agreement was it really necessary for Trump to withdraw with such fervor well it was not necessary but that's part of his character you know he he likes noisy statements he absolutely hates environmentalist and the environmentalist movement but in fact the problem is that the Paris climate agreement doesn't solve the problem you know it's only post polls maybe a little bit the actions the real actions that need to be taken I mean you you're it's very important issue to you yeah but you weren't enamored with the I was actually an advisory delegate to the international climate conference in Copenhagen a few years ago I take the issue very seriously what Trump did was ass off to his political base and to the big particularly the energy companies that helped him as they do all US politicians get elected I would be more concerned about this if Obama had done anything to combat climate change if I believe this agreement would do anything to combat climate change as it is it's mostly just a rhetorical statement it helps lesson again this perception of US leadership on the world but whether Trump signed this statement you know kept the u.s. bound to this agreement or not is not going to save the world from climate change and it in fact I believe that this agreement keeps real action against climate change a real agreement from being finalized you know Victor the problem is is that making it the u.s. is the determinant country and I think the next negotiation of some kind of global deal shouldn't have to rely so much on the United States I mean it's the u.s. it's either our way or the highway and we need an agreement in which starts getting around that what we've seen with the BRICS we see with other the non-western institutions where you start creating parallel institutions and that's the only way forward here the way I can see it because under this sitting president we won't have any kind of clock what the America really showed this year was that it is not just not an indispensable nation but it is also not a liable nation because with a new administration attitudes in Washington change one administration believes that climate change is real a new president videos that is not the policy changes from here to here America is not a nation that can be a world leader anymore ok well then it goes to the we have some frequently asked questions that I began getting over I get these all the time here first one here let me go to Dima on this one can Russia US relations worsen in 2018 you know there's always room for getting things worse and worse I mean if we read the the the mainstream press you know I want the brink of war because the claims made about Russia just wild and wild every year you know so of course there's room for getting things even worse because for example Ukraine I mean we're at the end of a very important stage the Normandy format is dead you know the last meeting they had the French leader that the German and the Russian it was in in August this year so two years of trying to get what the Ukrainian government wanted by peaceful means by just expecting Putin to give up done boss like Gorbachev gave up GDR like Yeltsin gave up he was Slava you know this period has ended now the Americans are back and but in the private see this kind of goes back to Victor's point here I mean we had this Normandy format which the United States is not part of and then you have the Europeans trying to coordinate a intra European upon European policy and then Trump and his administration says they're going to start sending in these weapons and we know weapons means go to all but it shows but it just shows the divergence right here so I mean what is the Western approach to the and and and and all of the the European approach the American approach does nothing to alleviate the problems of the Ukrainian people . the american approach is to use the situation in Ukraine to destabilize Russia south and borders and also to as a reason to extend and expand the political and the economic sanctions regime against Moscow that's exactly what the United States has been doing in fact in the next three months before presidential elections in Russia are going to be crucial in Donbass in Ukraine because the United States with its decision now to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine this decision is a signal it's a signal to Kiev that they can act aggressively in dunt bus to provoke to try to provoke Russia to either act to defend the Russian population there and then the United States would say that Russia intervenes in the in the internal affairs of Ukraine war if Russia does not act to protect the Russian population there then then the press would say that Putin is not defending the Russians the russian-speaking people that live there so the United States wants to use the strategic situation that it itself created by SEP together with Europe yes to stabilize Russia and and to weaken it before the election yeah I agree completely I would add only that also it serves as a pretext to start rebuilding a US military footprint right on Russia's borders and and that is not going to go away it's crossing the Rubicon but aside from the sanctions the rhetoric war the censorship war the diplomatic tip tit for tat it will get worse because in three potential hotspots Syria with the u.s. refusing to vacate and moving towards partition of the country with their proxies in Ukraine with this abandoning not only of the Normandy format but the Minsk protocols right we're gonna see a military escalation there and in North Korea and possibly also Iran where the u.s. is increasing the of rhetoric and and make giving Russia some indication that it intends to make some actual military moves these are more tension with Russia not less okay you touched on something I really want to continue here another frequently asked question do you think there'll be war against a war waged against North Korea well I hope not but of course Trump is doing everything to make this war possible and of course the initiative for the escalation it is not from North Korea I think North Korea you know give me one of the things you know they are the art of the deal here I can understand this kind of a inflammatory rhetoric when you're in a real estate deal okay I can understand that you know the grandstanding you know and all that but this is something so completely different and you can't use the art of the deal mentality when it comes to thermonuclear war you know there are more than a hundred thousand in fact almost two hundred thousand US citizens currently residing in South Korea among them tens of thousands of American soldiers and officers but mostly civilians and yeah you know heavy artillery in North Korea is right now and for years since the Korean War ended in 1953 has been stationed on the border with South Korea and Seoul is going to be in the first few hours after an American attack so it's going to be leveled there is nothing American Air Force or South Korean Air Force can really do to prevent that tens of thousands of people hundreds of thousands of people by Pentagon's own estimation three hundred thousand people would die in the first week in this country no delays the American generals understand this even if Trump tries to provoke them into this they they understand that this is not in the u.s. national interest and if that work happens there it would be a geopolitical catastrophe not only for North Korea and South Korea not only for Japan it will America's partners will no longer trust Washington and will not see Washington as a nation that that able to provide security instead we go back I think our usual viewers will understand demons analogy of a good share for the bad share of one of the best analogies made of this program here go ahead mark we're gonna finish up with you yeah I first of all Trump is his inflammatory rhetoric is just that we've had admittances before that when Trump is tweeting about North Korea the top generals are in the room with him so this is happening this this madman stratagem they're playing is entirely things the question is can the US security establishment live with North Korea having a nuclear deterrent they have to make that decision we don't know what their decision is at that point I think that they they do have to I think the thing is is that the it gets no hearing in Western media we've said it repeatedly on this program what does North Korea want Deema it's very simple oh she Asians to talk to us we know through the good offices of the Russian Foreign Ministry that North Korea was open to having direct talks with the United States I don't remember getting much air time at all in western media but because that's not an outcome they want again if you talk it's called negotiations if you go into negotiations as well a piece yes the same thing in Ukraine eventually what we were asked about the Russian plan for Ukraine there's just one plan talk to the people in don't bus you the government in Kiev that came to power through a coup talked to the peanuts the one thing they did not do because it would shatter their regime and the problem with the Europeans you know with the with the Normandy format it was that France and Germany they were not mediators they were on the side of Kiev they wanted Kiev to get it all they just wanted to get it without war America is ready to get it with war that's the whole difference of the approaches and unfortunately we're done now with the European approach we may be done with 2017 gentlemen I hope you had a good Christmas for the Russian Orthodox I hope you a Merry Christmas in the new year it's a it's different from the new Western calendar and I hope you all a very happy new year with your friends and your family and we'll see you all here on I think the first or second Sunday of January that's it and I hope to our viewers that you have a very Happy New Year and we'll see you in 2018 happy new happy new year
