1
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:05,559
>> Bill: 9:15 IN NEW YORK.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,128
BIG DAY TOMORROW IN WASHINGTON

3
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:09,063
DEPUTY A.G. ROD ROSENSTEIN

4
00:00:09,064 --> 00:00:10,230
EXPECTED TO FACE TOUGH

5
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,632
QUESTIONS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS

6
00:00:11,633 --> 00:00:14,234
IN FRONT OF LAWMAKERS FROM TWO

7
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:14,735
HOUSE COMMITTEES.

8
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:16,337
SOME REPUBLICANS DO NOT LIKE

9
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:17,304
THE FORMAT.

10
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,540
WANT TO BRING IN TOM FITTON,

11
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:20,507
PRESIDENT OF JUDICIAL WATCH.

12
00:00:20,508 --> 00:00:22,676
GOOD MORNING TO YOU.

13
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:26,080
JUST SO OUR VIEWERS KNOW, THEY

14
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:27,748
TOOK ABOUT 30 LAWMAKERS AND

15
00:00:27,749 --> 00:00:29,883
TOOK IT DOWN TO FOUR.

16
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:31,018
TWO REPUBLICANS AND TWO

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:31,385
DEMOCRATS.

18
00:00:31,386 --> 00:00:32,319
ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,788
>> OF COURSE NOT.

20
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,292
THIS WILL BE SECRET OND

21
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:41,962
TESTIMONY AND IF YOU TRY TO GET

22
00:00:41,963 --> 00:00:43,697
FACTS FROM GETTING OUT TO THE

23
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:44,865
REPUBLICAN THIS IS THE WAY YOU

24
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:46,533
DO IT.

25
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:48,168
THE FACT THAT A

26
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:49,103
REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE

27
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:50,738
WOULDN'T LET MORE REPUBLICANS

28
00:00:50,739 --> 00:00:51,905
IN TO QUESTION ROD ROSENSTEIN

29
00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:53,207
ABOUT WHETHER HE AND THE F.B.I.

30
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,676
WERE TALKING ABOUT TRYING TO

31
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:58,712
REMOVE THE PRESIDENT FROM

32
00:00:58,713 --> 00:01:00,114
OFFICE, THE FACT THAT THE

33
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:01,515
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T WANT

34
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,316
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OF

35
00:01:02,317 --> 00:01:04,351
CONGRESS, CONGRESS IN THIS CASE

36
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:06,453
IS WAY TOO DEFER ENTIONALL.

37
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:07,921
>> Bill: YOU KNOW GOODLATTE AND

38
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:08,555
GOWDY.

39
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:10,424
DO YOU NOT TRUST THAT THEY ASK

40
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:12,059
THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS?

41
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,861
>> I DON'T TRUST THAT THE

42
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:16,029
INFORMATION WILL GET OUT TO THE

43
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:20,167
AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A TIMELY WAY

44
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,269
AND I DON'T TRUST THAT

45
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,872
GENERALLY SPEAKING MEMBERS OF

46
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:25,806
CONGRESS AND CONGRESSIONAL

47
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:27,608
COMMITTEES DOING THESE TYPES OF

48
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,076
INVESTIGATIONS BEHIND CLOSED

49
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:29,777
DOORS.

50
00:01:29,778 --> 00:01:31,412
A SERIES OF OTHER WITNESSES

51
00:01:31,413 --> 00:01:31,979
RECENTLY QUESTIONED.

52
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,781
WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY

53
00:01:33,782 --> 00:01:34,248
SAID.

54
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:35,916
I'M TIRED OF THESE SECRET

55
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:36,817
TESTIMONIES BEFORE CONGRESS.

56
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:37,985
>> Bill: ONE MORE QUESTION AND

57
00:01:37,986 --> 00:01:40,354
I'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AREA.

58
00:01:40,355 --> 00:01:41,522
GOODLATTE SAYS LAWMAKERS WILL

59
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:43,390
BE ALLOWED TO VIEW THE

60
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,259
CLASSIFIED VERSION OF THE

61
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,460
INTERVIEW BEFORE AN

62
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:50,063
UNCLASSIFIED ONE IS MADE PUBLIC.

63
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:51,665
>> WHEN WILL THE UNCLASSIFIED

64
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:55,102
ONE GOING TO BE MADE PUBLIC?

65
00:01:55,103 --> 00:01:56,737
THAT'S THE QUESTION I HAVE.

66
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,405
THE SAME JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

67
00:01:58,406 --> 00:02:01,675
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO ANSWER THE

68
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:02,609
QUESTIONS WILL BE DECLASSIFYING

69
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,076
MATERIAL.

70
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:05,312
I THINK THAT'S A CONFLICT.

71
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:07,915
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU EXPECT

72
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:10,517
THESE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO

73
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,419
GET FROM ROSENSTEIN?

74
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,888
>> WELL, I SUSPECT HE WILL SAY

75
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,757
WHAT HE HAS BEEN SAYING

76
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:17,925
PRIVATELY IN RESPONSE TO

77
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:19,827
QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS MEETING

78
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:22,429
WITH THE F.B.I. ABOUT

79
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,096
WIRETAPPING THE PRESIDENT,

80
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:26,333
INVOKING 25th AMENDMENT THAT HE

81
00:02:26,334 --> 00:02:27,501
WAS JOKING ABOUT THE

82
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:27,901
WIRETAPPING.

83
00:02:27,902 --> 00:02:30,070
HE DIDN'T SAY HE WAS JOKING

84
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,939
ABOUT INVOKING THE 25th

85
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,406
AMENDMENT.

86
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:34,274
ALSO DISCUSSED AT THAT MEETING

87
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,610
IN THIS MEETING ABOUT

88
00:02:36,611 --> 00:02:37,311
OVERTHROWING THE PRESIDENT,

89
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:38,946
REMOVING HIM FROM OFFICE WAS

90
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:40,347
GETTING A SPECIAL COUNSEL

91
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:40,714
APPOINTED.

92
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:42,950
I JUST HOPE THEY FOCUS ON THE

93
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:44,117
APPOINTMENT OF THE SPECIAL

94
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:44,451
COUNSEL.

95
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,253
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE MUELLER

96
00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:47,855
OPERATION AND PROTECTING THE

97
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,490
MUELLER OPERATION FROM BEING

98
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:50,424
QUESTIONED ABOUT ITS CORE --

99
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:56,263
ABOUT THE WAY IT WAS CREATED.

100
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:57,197
IT WAS CREATED BECAUSE ROD

101
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,365
ROSENSTEIN THOUGHT HE WAS UNDER

102
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:00,234
THE GUN FROM DEMOCRATS AND

103
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:01,401
GETTING PRESSURE ABOUT COMEY

104
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:02,970
BEING FIRED AND ALSO A WITNESS

105
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:04,471
IN THE FIRING AND TO WASH HIS

106
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:08,775
HANDS OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR HE

107
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,210
APPOINTED MR. MUELLER, AND ON

108
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:14,248
TOP OF THAT YOU HAD COMEY

109
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,182
PRESSURING ROSENSTEIN, HIS

110
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:18,585
FRIEND, BY STEALING AND THEN

111
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:21,188
RELEASING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

112
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:21,655
F.B.I. RECORDS.

113
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,322
UNBELIEVABLE CIRCUMSTANCES.

114
00:03:22,323 --> 00:03:23,090
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF

115
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:24,291
THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE HAS NO

116
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,426
PLANS TO FIRE ROSENSTEIN?

117
00:03:26,427 --> 00:03:27,728
THAT'S BEEN A PARLOR GAME IN

118
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,464
WASHINGTON, D.C. FOR SOME TIME.

119
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:32,566
>> HE MAY HAVE NO PLANS TODAY

120
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:36,637
BUT HE MAY HAVE PLANS TOMORROW.

121
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:38,739
>> Bill: WE'LL SEE WHICH WAY

122
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,806
THE WIND BLOWS.

123
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:41,141
NOW, A FINAL QUESTION.

124
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:42,843
YOU DO NOT GIVE THE IMPRESSION

125
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:45,579
AT ALL THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BE

126
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,749
SATISFIED FROM THIS DESPITE THE

127
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,750
FACT THAT ROSENSTEIN FINALLY

128
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,485
WILL BE .  THERE

129
00:03:51,486 --> 00:03:55,956
>> THIS IS WHY JUDICIAL WATCH

130
00:03:55,957 --> 00:03:57,157
DOES ITS OWN INVESTIGATIONS,

131
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:59,192
BECAUSE CONGRESS ISN'T

132
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:01,528
NECESSARILY THE BEST VEHICLE

133
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:02,229
FOR TRANSPARENCY.

134
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,630
AND GETTING QUESTIONS ANSWERED.

135
00:04:03,631 --> 00:04:05,532
WE OFTEN GET DOCUMENTS ABOUT

136
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,567
KEY MEETINGS LIKE THIS

137
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:09,269
SOMETIMES BEFORE CONGRESS DID.

138
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,775
FOR INSTANCE, THE -- THE SHADY

139
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,443
FISA WARRANT APPLICATIONS

140
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:18,312
JUDICIAL OBTAINED BEFORE THE

141
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:18,845
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.

142
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:20,280
WE'LL BE DOING OUR OWN WORK

143
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,582
BECAUSE WE DON'T EXPECT MUCH

144
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,283
FROM CONGRESS.

145
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:25,385
HERE YOU HAVE CONGRESS

146
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,054
BASICALLY GETTING DOWN AND

147
00:04:27,055 --> 00:00:00,000
ALLOWING MR. ROSENSTEIN TO WALK
