after numerous accusations of sexual harassment the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein has issued an apology that kind of insinuates that he should get less of a backlash for some of his actions due to his liberalism so I'm gonna read you some of his apology he says that now he's going to need a place to channel his anger and so he's going to give the NRA his full attention and he also talks about one year and one year he began one year ago excuse me he began organizing a five million dollar foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC so that's sort of how he ends his apology for harassing women for upwards of 20 years multiple women have come out and said that he sexually harassed them most notably Ashley Judd so that's very interesting and in fact he has actually been an advocate for liberal causes and women's rights in fact he appeared at his local women's March last January he and out a faculty chair in Rosario steinem's named Malia Obama interned for him and so I think a lot of people are reading this and hearing this information I mean it's included in every article about him and thinking that it's sort of contradictory and I think that like okay you can be a woke bro and you can be progressive also you can be an asshole like it's very possible to be both are not mutually exclusive and I think for sometimes people think that because you you know are unlike the right side and you that are the right side or the left side but you because you think and believe in these truly moral causes and you give to them and you are progressive and whatever that makes you exempt from committing pre heinous actions I mean this is not a left or a right issue this is a man and power issue I just think I think this this whole thing kind of shows a little bit of like the bankruptcy of like American liberalism in a lot of sense like that day these stories about how everyone seemed to me like come on shocker Harvey Weinstein is a sexual predator you know like they were out there everyone kind of like there were rumors all the time and you know the the fact that they they're just like willings so willing to turn the other because you know they respect his money or is you know the the cool movies that he breaks out you know like yeah he's powerful you know like there was a story that David Sirota the investigative journalist for the International Business Times did a story yesterday oh yeah good for him there you go did a story yesterday about the you know how he donated $10,000 to save a it's the the District Attorney for New York who's like a super corrupt dude to drop charges of sexual or sexual harassment against them you know like it's just like and this was like all this stuff is kind of out there and like they they don't care they weaken but even if it's not out there I mean when you think about somewhat like we had Bill O'Reilly we had Roger Ailes but even some of the more like progressive and liberal companies are not exempt from that something you look at Google you look at all the tech companies and Silicon Valley CEOs that were exposed in that New York Times like article like no sexual harassment is an issue and it's not about the left or the right or who you donate to or if you put your pussy hat on it is about like sexual harassment is ingrained into our culture and we need to do something now and something serious to stop it yeah and I mean Harvey wine I worked I've worked in like Hollywood before like I've had the job at the talent agency that you're supposed to have when you first start working here and there's one book when I first heard that was just called perception perception perception or something or it's all about perception and and that's what I think is at play when you see things like Harvey Weinstein gave money to a woman's charity he went down to the thing a he's trying to seem woke or whatever that stupid word is but yeah you know he's trying to seem that way because of course he is because he wants to be thought of as an activist because activists are good he wants to eat but he at heart he wants to use all of his influence and all of his money to swing his wiener around and get you know that thing that he because he can't do it with with human kindness and personal connection he wants to do it like that explicit like I do think that there's like a chance that this is very like a subconscious thing I mean this culture is ingrained into people's like psyche a dependence so you may be it may be he is it mom a true and authentic I mean I don't know I know I know I know people who have had meetings with Harvey Weinstein that ended with Harvey Weinstein throwing a chair through a window yeah because he's just like like a darkened room with a suitcase full of cash and like up you're like maybe he believes in these causes right maybe he believes in and he's a real activist that this is what also like he can do this awful thing and so I think it's important and the lust is trying to separate from him there have been multiple senators who are donating his campaign contributions to them to different causes senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico is donating the money that Harvey Weinstein or Weinstein gave him to community against violence Blumenthal to a campaign to the Connecticut Alliance to end sexual violence Cory Booker to a the New Jersey coalition against sexual assault and many other senators are doing this so we're waiting to see what other senators do they're trying to a Weinstein has taken an indefinite leave they're so great the harassment inquiry very courageous it's crazy but so you know the point of they're still people in Hawley we're still gonna do like if Miramax are not even Miramax anymore the Hawley The Weinstein Company is gonna finance that movie yeah I'm gonna do it I need the money I mean look at me just look at what do y'all instill makes movies you know like it gets big actors to work with them and yeah it's so yeah you know like they don't at the end of the day they don't really care about this stuff help us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
