SO I ADMIRE HER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. APPRECIATE IT. HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND. Bill: BREAKING OVERNIGHT THE ISRAELI MILITARY BRACING FOR A NEW ROUND OF PROTESTS AROUND THE GAZA BORDER. IT HAS BEEN A FRIDAY AFTERNOON REPEATEDLY GOING BACK MONTHS NOW WHERE THERE IS ACTION. HAMAS HAS MADE NEWS HERE. MIKE TOBIN IS IN JERUSALEM. WHAT'S HAPPENING? FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS NOW WHEN PALESTINIANS GET DONE WITH FRIDAY PRAYERS THEY'VE BEEN GATHERING AT THE FENCE THAT SEPARATES ISRAEL FROM GAZA. LET ME SHOW YOU FILE VIDEO FROM PREVIOUS PROTESTS. THE PALESTINIANS ARE GATHERING AT THE FENCE NOW. WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT AT LEAST ONE GROUP HAS TRIED TO RUSH THE FENCE AND REPORTS OF THREE INJURIES THUS FAR. NOW IT IS THE THIRD FRIDAY IN RAMADAN, PALESTINIANS GO TO THE MOSQUE AND WE'LL SEE HOW BIG THE CROWD GETS AFTER THAT. ISLAMIC JIHAD AND MILITANTS IN GAZA FIRED MORTARS IN ISRAEL. ISRAEL RESPONDED WITH AIR STRIKES AND GREW ROCKETS FROM HAMAS AND ISLAMIC JIHAD THROUGH THE NIGHT. EGYPT WANTED A CEASE-FIRE SINCE WEDNESDAY. U.S. HAS MADE A DIPLOMATIC MOVE. PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOW CONSIDERING GIVING THE U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL, DAVID FRIEDMAN. MORE CONTROL OVER THE U.S. CONSULATE IN EAST JERUSALEM AND RESPONSIBLE FOR U.S. RELATIONS WITH THE PALESTINIANS IN GAZA AND THE WEST BANK. IT HAS REPORTED DIRECTLY TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT IN WASHINGTON NOW COMMUNICATION WILL BE FILTERED THROUGH THE EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM AND IS PARTICULARLY AGGRAVATING TO PALESTINIANS BECAUSE THE K *UR CURRENT U.S. AMBASSADOR IS A SUPPORTER OF THE WEST BANK SETTLER MOVEMENT. I SPOKE TO A PALESTINIAN LEADER
