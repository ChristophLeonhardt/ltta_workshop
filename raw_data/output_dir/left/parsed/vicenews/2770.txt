and Israel officially expired on Friday

into Israel from Gaza what followed was
another two days of tit-for-tat
airstrikes and rocket fire the left
civilians once again caught in the
crossfire having to pay the bloody price
for the breakdown in negotiations
so we're standing on top of a mosque in
the new Surat refugee camp others hit

flattened the whole moss was collapse

yeah in my family drink
so Carly's house isn't actually even the
house that was was targeted wasn't hit
directly by the strike that was the
building of one of us that's been
completely collapsing on itself but even
so the roof has come completely off
every single room in the house has been
completely you know wreck destroyed with
possessions thrown about everywhere it's
a pretty incredible amount of force
that's ruin this guy's house in his life
this is my bathroom but wrong shower
when I am bout what I'm drunk now
I don't know much my wife my children
well what we want to go now where I
don't know
they say this piece of the bomb itself
that flew through this hole here and
this was this hit a house across the
street and exploded flew through that
wall and then landed in the corner of
the kitchen here if anyone was hit by
that he'd be killed
so the idea talked about the way they
use precision strikes to take out their
targets here in the Gaza Strip
they've hit and leveled one house sure
if that was their target in the first
place but all the houses around it have
been damaged in some way
coloreds house has been ruined wrecked
every single floor of the flats that he
owns here have been smashed in the roofs
gone breaking the myth of the so-called
precision strike
