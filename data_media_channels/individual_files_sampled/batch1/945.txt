this is what's left of this section of the once-mighty Tigris River barely enough water to escape Iraq's burning daytime heat the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers were the main water supplies for these once lush rice fields farmers like Abdul Rahman used to be able to grow up to 80 square meters of rice that's only a little over 1% of the size of an average football pitch but it helped to keep his family alive now he produces barely a fraction of what he could grow before yeah look how dry this land is we can't get enough water even the water irrigation canals are empty Iraq's Ministry of Water Resources says that levels and rivers like the Tigris here in Baghdad have dropped up to 40 percent over the last 20 years they say that partly to blame our dams and reservoirs which are being built in Turkey to the north and they're restricting the flow of water southwards but also in the last nine months Iraq only had about half the amount of rainfall that normally gets over the course of a year and that's making things even worse it's estimated Iraq strategic water reservoirs contain 8 billion cubic meters of water less than the minimum the country needs so the government says it's stepping in the minute of our pilot and we plan to cultivate around 50 square kilometers of rice as well as 16 thousand square kilometers of orchards and vegetables for people to use in their homes but we can't provide as much water for crops as we did in previous years farmers tried digging wells to reach water underground but it's often saturated with salt and that's deadly for plants in the past we made more profit and we were rich with crops now we can hardly grow enough underground water isn't a solution it's a big problem to not have much water to irrigate your crops many farmers are taking jobs as laborers in the streets and on building sites leaving behind their dying fields Rob Mathison al Jazeera Baghdad
