1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,810
DONALD TRUMP WAS IN PENNSYLVANIA

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:07,250
DOING A RALLY FOR HIS REELECTION
WHICH IS STRANGE BECAUSE HE'S

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,630
ALREADY PRESIDENT AND THE
GENERAL ELECTION IS MORE

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,570
THAN TWO YEARS AWAY.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,150
DURING HIS RALLY HE DECIDED TO
GO BACK TO THE SAME ANTICS WHERE

6
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,039
HE SAYS TERRIBLE THINGS ABOUT
FEMALES.

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,380
THE LATEST EXAMPLE IS MAXINE
WATERS.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,449
TAKE A LISTEN.

9
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:35,710
>> MAXINE WATERS, A VERY LOW IQ
INDIVIDUAL, EVER SEE HER?

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,710
WE

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,440
WILL IMPEACH HIM, WE WILL
IMPEACH – BUT HE HASN'T

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,879
DONE ANYTHING WRONG – IT IS A
MATTER WE WILL IMPEACH HIM.

13
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,179
SHE IS A LOW IQ INDIVIDUAL.

14
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:53,899
>> THE WORST THING ABOUT IT IS
IF YOU LOOK BEHIND HIM

15
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,059
THERE ARE A BUNCH OF KIDS.

16
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:06,980
AND IT IS JUST SAD TO ME, I JUST
DON'T THINK THAT SOMETHING A KID

17
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,130
SHOULD LOOK AT AS A GOOD EXAMPLE
OF HOW PEOPLE SHOULD BEHAVE.

18
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,270
>> I AM LESS WORRIED ABOUT HIM
BEING RUDE THAN I AM AT THE

19
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,100
GREAT IRONY OF DONALD TRUMP
CALLING ANYONE ELSE LOW IQ.

20
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,359
>> I HAVE SOME FUN IN STORE FOR
YOU TO BUTTRESS YOUR POINT.

21
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:35,009
>>MAXINE WATERS HAS BEEN CALLED
A LOT OF THINGS AND SOME

22
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,789
JUSTIFIED CRITICISM ON SOME
ISSUES, SHE HAS BEEN A CHAMPION

23
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:44,539
ON OTHERS, BUT LOW IQ HAS NOT
BEEN A CRITICISM OF MAXINE

24
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:45,539
WATERS.

25
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,799
SHE IS VERY SAVVY, A POLITICAL
PLAYER IN WASHINGTON FOR A

26
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,880
LONG TIME.

27
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,280
FOR A CERTIFIABLE MORON TO CALL
ANYONE LOW IQ LET ALONE

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,909
MAXINE WATERS IS BOTH DISTURBING
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT HILARIOUS.

29
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:02,909
>>MAXINE

30
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:10,889
WATERS DID RESPOND TO THE
CRITICISM, LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

31
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:17,080
>> HE IS EXPERT AT NAME-CALLING,
I UNDERSTAND THAT IN ADDITION TO

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,820
CONTINUING HIS NAME-CALLING OF
ME REFERRING TO MY IQ AND

33
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,790
CALLING ME LOW IQ THAT HE
CONTINUED TO ATTACK ELIZABETH

34
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,630
WARREN, NANCY PELOSI, MADE SOME
REFERENCES TO OPRAH WINFREY AND

35
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,240
IT SEEMS THAT HE IS IDENTIFYING
AND PICKING UP MORE WOMEN THAN

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,470
HE IS ATTACKING, THIS IS NOT
ONLY TYPICAL OF HIM, THIS IS

37
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,590
WHAT THIS CONMAN DOES, HE
DIVERTS ATTENTION FROM HIMSELF

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,250
BY ATTACKING OTHERS.

39
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,080
THIS BUSINESS ABOUT STORMY IS
NOT GOING TO GO AWAY.

40
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,540
HE CAN CALL US ALL THE NAMES HE
WANTS TO BUT OUR SPECIAL COUNSEL

41
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,610
IS CONNECTING THE DOTS AND LAST
NIGHT IN A SPEECH I SAID THAT IF

42
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:13,940
FOR SOME REASON MUELLER DOES NOT
GET HIM, STORMY WILL.

43
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,430
I'M NOT INTIMIDATED BY HIM SO HE
CAN KEEP CALLING NAMES.

44
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,050
I'VE GOT PLENTY FOR HIM.

45
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,470
AS A MATTER OF FACT EVERYBODY
KNOWS HE'S A CONMAN, HE'S BEEN

46
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,090
A CONMAN ALL OF HIS LIFE, LONG
BEFORE HE EVER RAN FOR OFFICE

47
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,980
AND SO THIS CONMAN, CONMAN DON
IS GOING TO KEEP IT UP AND

48
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,970
AGAIN HE'S COMING FOR ME, I'M
COMING FOR HIM.

49
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,660
>>I LOVE THAT LAST SENTENCE.

50
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,930
>>YEAH, SHE IS NOT INTIMIDATED.

51
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,120
BY THE WAY YOU MENTIONED THE
IRONY.

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,850
WE'RE GOING TO GET TO HIM IN A
SECOND, BUT THE PEOPLE

53
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,750
BEHIND HIM WERE CHEERING HIM ON
AS HE SAYS THOSE THINGS

54
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,750
ABOUT MAXINE WATERS.

55
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:02,070
THERE HOLDING SIGNS THAT SAY
DRAIN THE SWAMP TO A PRESIDENT

56
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,020
THAT HAS REX TILLERSON, FORMER
CEO OF EXXON MOBIL SITTING THERE

57
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,220
IN HIS CABINET.

58
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,600
SIGMUND NGUYEN, WALL STREET
BANKER, GOOD JOB DRAINING

59
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
THE SWAMP.

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,709
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT WHO LACKS
IQ.

61
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,920
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT MAXINE
WATERS.

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,870
>>YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO INSULT
REPUBLICAN VOTERS BECAUSE

63
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,480
MAINSTREAM MEDIA HATES THAT, ON
THE OTHER HAND FOR 40 YEARS

64
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,980
THEY'VE BEEN INSULTING LIBERALS
ON THE RADIO AND TV NONSTOP BUT

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,570
NOBODY EVER SAID THAT WAS NOT
ACCEPTABLE.

66
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:39,690
LAMY, THE CROWD FOR WHO THEY
ARE, THEY ARE THE CAST FOR THE

67
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:43,910
NEXT GOONIES THAT'S BEING SHOT.

68
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,900
DID YOUR FEELINGS GET HURT?

69
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,770
YOU
WENT TO AN IDIOTIC DONALD TRUMP

70
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:54,550
RALLY AND YOU CHEERED IT ALL THE
STUPID THINGS HE SAID AND I'M

71
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,190
SUPPOSED TO BE POLITE TO YOU?

72
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,480
THERE IS A GUY SEEMING TO WEAR A

73
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:14,260
TURTLE NECK 
BUT IT IS NOT A

74
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,300
NECK.

75
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,530
>>MAYBE THEY HAVE A POINT, LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW SMART

76
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,540
DONALD TRUMP IS.

77
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,320
>>THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT
CLEAN COAL MEANING THEY ARE

78
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,550
TAKING OUT CALL, THEY ARE GOING
TO CLEAN IT.

79
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:35,230
LAMB THE SHAM, HE'S TRYING TO
ACT LIKE A REPUBLICAN SO HE GETS

80
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,690
– HE WILL GIVE ME ONE VOTE.

81
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,470
I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKS LIKE A
NICE GUY, I HEAR HE'S

82
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,040
NICE-LOOKING, I THINK I'M BETTER
LOOKING THAN HIM.

83
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,980
I DO.

84
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,680
AND HE IS SLIGHTLY YOUNGER THAN
ME.

85
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:58,000
NOBODY HAS MORE RESPECT 
FOR

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,960
WOMEN THAN I DO, NOBODY.

87
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,490
>> IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLY COMPLEX
SUBJECT.

88
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,510
NOBODY KNEW HEALTHCARE
COULD BE SO COMPLICATED?

89
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,620
WILL ROSIE O'DONNELL IS
DISGUSTING BOTH INSIDE AND OUT.

90
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,860
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT HER, SHE'S A
SLOB.

91
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,020
SHE TOXIC A TRUCK DRIVER.

92
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:30,120
WELL YOUR FATHER IS LOOKING DOWN
AND IS VERY PROUD 

93
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
OF YOU.

94
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,340
>>WELL, HE STILL ALIVE.

95
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,259
>> THEN HE'S EVEN MORE PROUD.

96
00:06:36,259 --> 00:06:38,600
>> WE DON'T MAKE MISTAKES.

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,360
GO AHEAD KEN.

98
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,530
>>CHUCK HERE.

99
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,400
>>THAT IS OUR HIGH IQ PRESIDENT.

100
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:52,680
>> THE 
MINUTE YOU KNEW DONALD

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,740
TRUMP CAME INTO THE ROOM

102
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,810
SCREAMING HOW HE IS A SMART
PERSON WE COULD HAVE NOW SAID

103
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:03,490
THAT HE EVEN WROTE IT IN A TWEET
AND SCREAMED IN A TWEET THAT I

104
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,570
AM A VERY STABLE GENIUS.

105
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,720
YOU
SHOULD THOUGHT HE THINKS HE DOTH

106
00:07:09,720 --> 00:00:00,000
PROTEST TOO MUCH.
