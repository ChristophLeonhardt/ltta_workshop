remember last week when a dozen Greenpeace protesters illegally occupied a bridge in Vancouver well I just caught the CBC apologizing for their unusually well-done story because they covered a Greenpeace trespasser involved two fairly and the trespasser didn't like it the state broadcaster did a relatively good job covering the unlawful trespass of to Edmonton Greenpeace protesters who suspended themselves from the ironworkers Memorial Bridge in Vancouver those Kooks were up there for more than 24 hours doing god only knows what and the Greenpeace activists were protesting of course of course the Kinder Morgan trans mountain pipeline expansion now I'm not sure how stringing yourself up on a bridge does that exactly but I'm not inside the minds of these people and you know what I never ever want to be anyway in a rare act of journalism CBC did their job the CBC article covered a lot of the backgrounds of the two radicals from Edmonton and they exposed one of them a man named Fareed Iskandar as someone with strong ties to the mainstream left here in Alberta Iskandar was charged with mischief and jeopardizing the safety of a vessel now CBC reported that iskind arse now deleted LinkedIn page said he was employed as a social marketing coordinator with the City of Edmonton Iskandar also told the CBC that he volunteered for Rachel Mellie's electoral campaign in 2015 now the city has said that is kandar resigned before the protest but they won't give the exact date of that resignation and Sameera Canada which is a group that encourages political engagement of everyday citizens has a brief bio of Iskandar submitted by somebody else now the bio says that Eskander was a door knocker in the twenty 13 mayoral campaign in Edmonton and he was a vice president external of the University of Alberta's Student Union oh and he's an immigrant from Egypt and the only reason I bring this up is because he weapon eise's his immigration status a little bit later then after the CBC story came out this trespasser Iskandar who spoke to CBC willingly became mad because CBC wasn't expressly sympathetic to his radical environmentalist worldview I'm not making this up so playing the victim is canard took to Twitter tweeting that here's my email to the CBC Edmonton radio producer who called me yesterday to prepare for my radio interview this morning I'm really disappointed that CBC News is taking their lead from trolls online and are feeding the trolls with the content they want do better CBC knowing that tweet was a screenshot of an email that ISKCON are sent to the CBC producer after their coverage of him you will not believe this email hi Ariel I wanted to let you know that I'm disappointed I got asked where I work in spite of our phone conversation yesterday I took a lot of risk to do this action I am a person of color I am a 0 generation Canadian south-of-the-border were seeing the rise of anti-immigrant movement Stephen Harper passed legislation when he was in power making me a second-class citizen compared to those born in Canada Trudeau got rid of this legislation but who knows what's going to happen in the years to come Ford is in Ontario now Kenney likely to be premier in nine months Canada is not all that different from the US as we like to think I took these risks because I'm standing up for my beliefs the planet is heating fast indigenous land rights are being trampled I'm doing this for my generation and for generations to come all I asked was not to be asked what I do for my labor what my source of income was that seemed to me like a reasonable ask in comparison to all the risks I have taken but you chose to ignore that I hope you don't feel good about this decision okay that is all kinds of crazy right there it's Knauer states the fact that he's an immigrant to our country as a reason why CDC should have been more sympathetic to his law breaking it is true that under Stephen Harper if is canard did break the law he could have been stripped of his citizenship and deported back to Egypt and you know what I probably wouldn't have shed any tears about it but Trudeau did revoke that law and this fellow is now able to break whatever Canadian laws he wants and remain within our generous borders and somehow somehow because Doug Ford is refusing to pay for illegal refugees that's another reason why CBC should have been nicer to Iskandar oh and Jason Kenney and Donald Trump are also out to get him I think this guy is using his immigration status as a shield from criticism when he broke the law on camera for the entire world to see he actually sought out the attention of law breaking and now he's using his cultural background as a reason why he should be free of any real public consequences and it's pretty clear that the CBC agreed to protect him from scrutiny to some level Biskind art even sent this tweet here where he is crying about CBC saying that he might be fired because of CBC's coverage this is laughable welcome to the online world that conservatives live in did this I say so what I'm one of those mean right wingers that Iskandar is so scared of anyway I said that CBC did a rare job of journalism but it it didn't really last because this person responding here is the CBC Associate Producer that Iskandar initially emailed the one who Eskander implies agreed he wouldn't be asked where he worked and as you can see here she is apologizing for CBC reporting accurately on the background of this accused criminal who was breaking the law for attention - I'm writing back to you via email I'm sorry about this situation you think this CBC producer would be apologizing for a right-winger who said that they got a little bit too much heat for breaking the law would she apologized to I don't know a drunk driver who ends up being fired from their job because CBC reported their name no so why is this guy getting a pass except for the fact that he is on the same ideological team as the left wingers at the CBC would CDC apologize to MLA Derek Hildebrandt for the destruction of his career when they have reported his legal troubles with poaching and a hit and run 1.5 billion dollars in government subsidies per year for hard journalism that the CBC argues that no one else can do and here they are groveling at the feet of a wingnut because the wingnut is scared of the consequences for his own bad actions you know this is something I'm pretty sure probably goes on all the time in the background but it's crazy to see it happening in real time just out in the open it's so brazen it's sort of like Bigfoot you know he exists because you see his hair in the woods all the time but it's something else altogether to see him eating s'mores around a campfire with his buddies we just saw the CBC agreeing to protect an anti Canadian radical and then apologizing because they accidentally didn't protect him it's not just about the radical though by protecting the radical CBC would be protecting the left-wing City of Edmonton and Rachel notley's NDP from the scrutiny they also deserve for their ties to Iskandar so what's the moral of this story here friends CBC is on the side of the criminals as long as the criminals are on the left and CBC is actively tailoring their news coverage in such a way that criminals feelings don't get hurt remember that when you sit down to watch the National tonight just kidding you guys no one watches the national for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read unlike the CBC we give the Trudeau government to the scrutiny they deserve and that's why we have a brand new shirt out commemorating Trudeau's kokanee grope go to grope shirts com2 order yours today you
