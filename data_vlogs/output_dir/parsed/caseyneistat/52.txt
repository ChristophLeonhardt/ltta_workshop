Hey
it's about 4:45 a.m. right now I did my
training yesterday my inaugural test
flight will be in about about 20 minutes
this is the safety vest it has a little
bit of flotation in it and then this is
tear resistant a little bit of shoulder
patty protected this is all the
protection I get helmet for obvious
reasons loud and clear
okay starting flyer okay this is your
about 15 seconds away from find the
first ever flying car
okay in conclusion my final my thoughts
my comprehensive review of the flyer is
that it's amazing
if this thing didn't have all these
limiters on it I would have taken it up
to 500 feet and just flown it back to
the strip I felt that confident so good
work team at Kitty Hawk
meet George Jetson
