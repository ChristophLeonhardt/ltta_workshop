the Turkish president or the one is in Germany on his first formal state visit it comes amid growing economic pressure from Washington on both Germany and Turkey what are the one that said at times like these Berlin and Ankara need to put their problems aside it's Peter Oliver now reports from Berlin turkish President Erdogan is in Germany with the extending of olive branches the building of bridges and the turning over of new pages in the relationship between Ankara and Berlin front and center it is our responsibility to rationally move our relations forward on the basis of our shared interests quite apart from irrational fears it's been a while since he was here 2014 was the last time the one was in Germany on official business and in that time Wow have there been some exchanges between the two nations I can't see turkey being admitted to the European Union I have never been able to see it happening a Germany you have no relation whatsoever to democracy and you should know that your current actions are no different to those of the Nazi period President Erdogan you're jeopardizing everything that you with others have built and the unspeakable Nazi comparisons to not cut ties to those who want the partnership we took I'm calling on all my countrymen in Germany the Christian Democrats the SDP and the Green Party are all enemies of Turkey support those political parties who are not enemies of Turkey so you see there's more than just a few indiscretions to be overcome if the Chancellor and the president are to be chums again if we go back to the attempted coup in Turkey in 2016 Ankara is unhappy that suspects accused of taking part in a coup have been granted asylum in Germany while Germany's unhappy that while German citizens in jail in Turkey accused of taking part there if we also look at elections then well turkeys unhappy and other one in particular unhappy that Turkish rallies weren't allowed to be held in some German states while Germany which was no hosting elections in the same year they were angry that President Erdogan deemed it necessary to well give tips to Turkish Germans on how they should vote in the German general election the relationship between Germany and Turkey is in a real low right now if only there was someone they could unite against her one in particular is keen to have mrs.

Dewan may have to concede Germany has just beaten Turkey to the right to host the 2024 European football championships but of course that probably pale into insignificance when there's a trade war waging Trump to unite against Peter Oliver RT Berlin you
