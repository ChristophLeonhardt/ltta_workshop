begin with president from hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe a at mar-a-lago yesterday and resolving the crisis was front and center on their agenda the North Korean crisis that is in addition to Trump's possible upcoming summit with Kim jong-un and I hope to have a very successful meeting if we don't think it's going to be successful mark we won't have it we won't have it if I think that it's a meeting that is not going to be fruitful we're not going to go if the meeting when I'm there is not fruitful I will respectfully leave the meeting and will continue what we're doing president Trump said on Tuesday five locations currently under consideration for his possible summit with Kim and multiple US officials tell NBC News Switzerland Sweden and Singapore are among the frontrunners a senior US official tells NBC News several locations have been ruled out including Pyongyang Beijing and Mongolia all of which raised security concerns bloomberg reports that pan moon jom the site of the Korean War armistice signing also has been ruled out president Trump yesterday also expanded on outgoing CIA director and Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo and his secret meeting with Kim in North Korea which the president confirmed yesterday in an early morning tweet the White House issued a correction yesterday on the timing of pompeius trip to North Korea saying it took place over Easter weekend nearly three weeks ago not last week as the president we did Richard Haas let me start with you on all of this so joint joint press conference at mar-a-lago with Shinzo Abe a yesterday the focus of it obviously was North Korea as you've watched this play out from the Pompeo meeting and the description of how it took place and what may take place next with a meeting between President Trump and Kim jong-un and have you been impressed by the way that this administration has gone forward what the administration has done is put enormous pressure on itself by agreeing to a presidential summit as the first step usually that's the caboose of the train they made it the the engine but the fact that Mike Pompeo went is good news because that suggests a degree of preparation and what the president said yesterday part of what part of it was okay if he didn't think things were going to be fruitful they would not go ahead to the summit that is good if the preparation suggests that there's not a deal to be had just as well you don't have it what you don't want to do is have a summit that totally falls apart because then the reaction will be well we tried diplomacy that didn't work now we've got to try something else which is not what you want it's all going to come down to the president used the word fruitful yesterday what does he mean by fruitful how ambitious are we going to be what are we going to require now what are we going to require down the road what are we prepared to offer to the Devils in the details and it really comes down to what will we be satisfied with at this point and what are we prepared to postpone till we've heard the term denuclearization quite a bit if that would be what we want that that's the goal can you see a universe where King jungle and gives up the one thing he has in the world stage no but I can't see a universe where he could agree to denuclearization down the road to be details TBD to be determined you can imagine a situation where this could be a long-range goal to get rid of all nuclear weapons on the peninsula now he may have the 26 things he would require from us in order in order to bring that about and the real question that is are we prepared to live with a delayed somewhat vague concept of denuclearization in exchange for some very specific limits right now for example no you know extend the ban on North Korea testing of any nuclear warhead or any ballistic missile that's that's the question but denuclearization can mean anything to anybody and it could be extraordinarily difficult to bring about but if it required that we inspect inside North Korea to make sure there's no nuclear activities going on imagine how difficult it would be and be impossible to prove these nuclear Sejal and haven't we run into situations where the Korean North Koreans say one thing and then actually do something else I mean that seems to be a theme through the 90s I mean you ran into this under the Obama administration sure what yeah I mean every president basically over the last 30 years or so has run into this scenario where the with the North Koreans essentially try to use the prospect of possible negotiations as cover continue to develop their nuclear program you know just to pick up on where Richard left off I actually think that the widely criticized Iran deal that was negotiated by the Obama administration actually may provide some breadcrumbs about a path here because one of the benefits of the Iran deal while not perfect does actually have in place a rigorous program to verify that Iran is not further developing their nuclear program so maybe that's where you get the outline of a deal some kind of rigorous verification measures that the North Koreans agree to so because we already do know that they're having trouble with this process of essentially minted miniaturizing their nuclear capability to fit it on top of the missile maybe you can put in some place some kind of regime that would verify that they don't make further advances that would limit the risk that we face even if that's D nuclearization is the longer-term goal to think so I doubt as you know using the Iran agreement as an example is going to be a winning argument with this administration well they change positions on this like five days a week that comes up on May 12th they've got to make their announcement on Iran de second of all that's exactly the sort of thing we probably wouldn't be able to monitor the the more intrusive the requirements are for verification the less likely we're gonna have the access and have the competence that's why I like testing freezes we don't have to get inside North Korea to monitor or verify a testing freeze if we need to do certain types of modernization or production freezes I think we're in a very difficult situation you know Richard hovering above all of this though is the fact that despite Pompeo s trip to Pyongyang there is no State Department there is very little fringe element of a diplomatic approach on this and one of our one of our most vital allies in the region Prime Minister Abba and Japan he's in Palm Beach today they are sort of on the outside of this looking in how does that affect this whole thing going forward well it's reminder that the United States is not alone here you've got Japan and you've got South Korea who are very different priorities we all probably have the same list of interests we don't we just don't rank them in the same way now the president gave something to Prime Minister Abbott he talked about the so-called abductees Japanese citizens who have been taken a hostage essentially kidnapped for decades in North Korea so you put that on the agenda but Japan for example doesn't just talk about long reign nuclear missiles long-range ballistic missiles they're concerned about short-range missiles that can reach them so where's that going to fit on the agenda also the Japanese were embarrassed the fact that Pompeo Strip was announced why a base year they didn't know about that and it just showed how they're not driving the diplomatic train here even though there's obviously so directly affected by the diplomat there's also the question Elise you worked in the State Department of Mike Pompeo being the person to go over the head of CIA the State Department nominee if you listen to the president from talk yesterday he seemed to be saying well he's already behaving like the Secretary of State maybe he ought to just be the Secretary of State is he the right guy to be there it made a lot of sense for my crime pair to go over to Pyongyang he the Intel the Intel relationship is one that is has been a long-standing channel as in the Obama administration when DNI James clapper went over to try to obtain the release of the two missionaries so I think that it does help the timing of this announcement is interesting because it offended the Japanese you're announcing it and kind of undercutting their visit at the same time that Mike Pompeo really needs the boost and I do wonder if this is going to be enough to propel him over the top because I in days of late I haven't thought he was going to get confirmed it was going to be able to do it but this might be enough to actually help propel him over the finish line the weather complication though is that there are some questions about whether Pompeo was honest with members of Congress about that trip what we don't know whether or not he disclosed in the context of all the private conversations he's having even in classified settings about whether or not he acknowledged that trip it's akin to lying on the job interview and particularly if you have a wavering senator who finds out after meeting with you and private two weeks later or the president announced that you did this significant consequential visit that you didn't disclose that's a it's a kind of an odd way to try to convince wavering senators to support their nomination senators yeah I think it helps obviously I think it's when it now has done is is commingled upon payos confirmation with the North Korea diplomacy issue I actually think it's a significant boost for my backers now to vote against them to basically say we don't want him to continue in this path in the run-up to the North Korea summit I think that that be a consequential actually pick I completely agree and president is showing that he has trust and another person to have a role and to have a seat at the table and I don't think that senators I think they're gonna be very reticent to undercut that my big question at this moment is where is this actually going to be how is Kim jong-un going to fly to any of these locations does he have aircraft it isn't going to crash on the way they can go more than a thousand miles his old Soviet you know Jets I think that it's a there are a lot of logistical headaches and you look at the trial locations that have been floated and it just can't be very far and certainly Donald Trump isn't going to want to go to Pyongyang well it's funny you bring that up to Elise's point the side of the potential Trump Kim some it may come down simply to a question of Transportation ken kim's plane actually get him to the proposed location according to New York Times it's unclear if Kim's fleet of Soviet aeroplanes can fly him more than a few thousand miles from North Korea one former CIA analyst tells the paper we know he has a plane no one really knows if it works finding a location within a limited radius may prove quite the challenge a venue in Asia may provide the easiest compromise allowing Kim to avoid air travel all together the paper concludes that borrowing a plane is out of the question for the North Korean leader he's also got the train Richard we're looking at their travels like 22 miles an hour because it's so heavily armored to get on his trip to Beijing but but what I mean is this a real concern can you just stop and refuel or something or it's just a sort of a manufactured problem 26 concerns I have about this summit this is 27 it's the whole thing again is expectations and there's too dangerous here it's not it's not where it happens the real danger is one to fail your option and then we say again we tried diplomacy and the other is what price have we prepared conceivably to pay for success what are we prepared to put on the agenda and for example what about the u.s. south korean alliance what about the u.s. japanese so i'm actually worried about both ends of the barbell that it fails or quote-unquote that it succeeds but on terms where I believe we've given up too much and that's why that that's the real issue not where the summit happens well to Richard's point you know what about troops in South Korea this is something that Donald Trump is bandied around constantly on the campaign trail oh he's just gonna remove our troops is he gonna sit down with Kim Jong on you just be like yeah that's okay yeah why now yeah we've cares eh it'll save us money apparently he does I have heard from officials that President Trump does but he understands that the South Koreans play a vital role in actually paying for their contribution which he appreciates but who knows thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up-to-date on the day's biggest stories
