michael cohen is the former longtime personal lawyer to donald trump and apparently he didn't just do law he also did secret recordings including in the months leading up to the 2016 election in which he recorded a conversation with donald trump about payments they plan to make to a former playboy model who alleges she had an affair with donald trump and they wanted to pay her off so that she would not talk about it in the run-up to the election the former model Karen McDougal says she began a nearly year-long affair with Trump in 2006 shortly after Trump's wife Melania gave birth to their son Baron Miss mcdougal sold her story eventually for one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the National Inquirer which was supportive of Trump during the final months of the presidential campaign but the tabloids sat on the story which kept it from becoming public I guess you just they couldn't fit it there's too much other news so they never ended up actually covering the story which is too bad it happens here sometimes too so the boy was trapped in a refrigerator ate his own foot and that story needed to be covered yeah timely aliens have Berlin just that week and the week after and the week after there's a definitive proof that they buried it a little bit later in this story exactly now we got accent what we didn't get access but access was granted to these these recordings when the FBI raided Michael Cohen's office earlier this year the lawyers in favor of or the ones defending Michael Cohen apparently shared it with Donald Trump's lawyers obviously they did not cop to the presence of these until it was eventually released earlier today but they have that access to it we have been alerted to the fact that there are probably other tapes as well now that doesn't mean that Donald Trump is willing to admit that anything bad happened his other lawyers the replacements for Michael Cohen have come forward to talk about it Rudy Giuliani who is still technically his lawyer and not just the guy who goes on TV to get him in trouble every day confirmed in a telephone conversation on Friday that Trump had discussed payments to mrs. MacDougal with Cohen in person on the recording he said it was less than two minutes long said Trump did not know he was being recorded and claimed that the president had done nothing wrong and Rudy Giuliani specifically said nothing in that conversation suggests he had any knowledge of an advanced he said the tapes were scalped Ori in fact yeah exactly I love I love the idea he didn't know about it in advance and the conversation was less than two minutes long which means that they can really wrap these things up fast like you alert me to the possibility this woman is lying about an affair and I authorized the gigantic payment like that right no big deal it's like it's a great point John it's a fact because it's like when in every movie every movie that doesn't work narrative Lee where the cops get on the plane to fly from New York to Vegas to pick up the key suspect in the murder they land we see them get on the plane then later we see them landing getting off the plane and one cop says to the other so where do you think is and you're like what did you people talk about for five hours on the planet so yeah let's break this down first off don't believe anything Rudy Giuliani says he says exculpatory no it's not why do you think they're trying to get ahead of the story it's explosive that's why well I mean technically he didn't say he knew about it ahead of time now it might be that what Cowan says on the tapes and we obviously don't have a content of the tapes here but we have a lot of stories about people who did listen to them and then I give these stories so it's possible that in the tapes Cowan calls Trump and says the payment by the owners of the National Enquirer has been made right so and Trump goes good okay and it gets wrapped up in two minutes now Giuliani goes see he told him about it afterwards - John and Ben's point if you heard somebody called you randomly and said hey this woman you've never heard of that you might or might not have had an affair with somebody else paid a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to shut her up would you be like oh okay that's interesting I'll see you later okay no that means that's a thing you normally do good I'm glad it was taken care of right this is so obvious and I'm done trying to convince Trump people that you know like oh no yeah that's totally normal you have somebody called me I think you say $150,000 for an affair I might or might not have had I can wrap that up in two minutes right okay all right fine you're a lunatic I don't care to discuss that with you okay for everybody else it's super obvious what happened okay but there's two other to this that are monumentally important one Giuliani admitting it takes away the possibility of one other defense Trump could have done in court which is attorney-client privilege so it is either a failing of his which is the first analysis that a lot of people did or he's actually trying to hide the other story so let me do the first one okay so a lot of people has finished early and I said that a lot of lawyers and former prosecutors came out and said y know God's green earth would your own lawyer do that that takes away your ability in case you could of saying attorney-client privilege you want to reserve all your your rights before going into court as negative aggressive Tullis you hold your pattern actually sure right and so and and one theory was Cohen actually tricked them that the courts had not already passed it on to the prosecutors and that it was privileged and Cohen leaked it thereby getting Giuliani and Trump to believe that the prosecutors had it and so then Julian is like oh yeah it was it was fine it was there's nothing wrong with that call and it's like boom got you so if that's the case that's interesting and well played by Michael Cohen who had to be advised by someone oh he's being advised by being advised by Lanny Davis yes by the way that's in a quick aside another thing of like has Michael Cohen flipped on Donald Trump that's over Lanny Davis is the most Pro Hillary lawyer and maybe person in a country he he's been with the Clintons his whole life you do not hire Lanny Davis if you haven't flipped on Donald Trump it's not a question anyone who thinks it's a question dust hasn't followed politics in the last couple of decades in America Lanny Davis is in essence not only a lawyer but a Democratic operative he I mean a democratic operative loathes in many ways even by establishment mainstream Democrats he's such a conservative Democrat yeah but but in the Clinton camp clearly in the Clinton camp okay I'm keeping a reelin you could hold out against them but that's overwhelming evidence that Cohen is not a trumpet Davis said that this is the new Michael Cohen yeah that's over it's over he flipped that in essence right so okay now the explosive part oh that is fun that was actually an appetizer so I had this theory when I read it I was like now there's something wrong with this story you don't get out ahead of a story like this unless you're trying to cover up something else and then Ron Blitzer wrote about it as well on and I think a look yeah on law on crime and I was like okay good I'm not the only one and so it doesn't mean we're right but they talked about the tapes everybody acknowledges the tapes okay there's a tape of him talking about McDougal to playboy my thing I know you're there is another Playboy model cerebral shirred who they claimed had an affair with Brody the Republican financier of Donald Trump and had an abortion and they paid her nine hundred fifty thousand dollars one point six million dollars that's a whole nother level like perhaps if you had an abortion she did have an abortion they came out and just like in this story Brody raised his hand immediately was it was me it was me and um and you caught me no we didn't catch you why did you raise your hand that was really weird right and it was not for the abortion it definitely wasn't why didn't maybe she did maybe she didn't show us she did but but the 1.6 million was not for the bush so there has been an ongoing through theory written by the New York Magazine and many others that brush is fronting for trouble yes that Bashar did not have the affair with Brody she had it with Trump and and in fact it was a way of paying for Trump's abortion and if a royalty did that did he receive anything for that and if he did that is a massive crime okay and but we know that in the contracts the defense contracts that his company got went from huge like I don't have the numbers in front of me but on this scale $80 in contracts to six hundred and twenty seven million dollars in contracts that he's gotten since Donald Trump came yes so he that's a long story and I've talked about on the show before he gets contrast for the United Arab Emirates for over six hundred million dollars Donald Trump does favors for the United Arab Emirates and as opposed to Qatar which is what they wanted huge which in American policy without explanation yes and then finally that why when Juliana comes on goes to Google yeah man we did that one oh did I say that out loud mcdougal though remember everybody mcdougal not for sure and also uh the the sources saying that they and in regard to there's other tapes that the other tapes are with Cohen and people of significance and consequence that was the quote significance and counsel do you mean if you see more earlier about nothing can divorce Trump supporters from Trump and in a sense this is just going to make them feel more enthusiastic because there's a religious component to it and I'm not talking about the missionary position religious component is this idea held by Trump supporters that God works through the most unlikely characters right so the worse Trump is the more immoral he is to this group of supporters the more it affirms the magic of God's power working through this incredibly unlikely character how do you reason with people who don't use a reason so because if you said that okay well then clinton's immorality which you said was the worst thing in the world should be God working in mysterious worries and showing his magic no that's immoral Trump doing something way worse God's magic well Obama they said was literally the Antichrist wouldn't that be the ultimate wait for God to work through the Antichrist for Trump Bernie Sanders what okay but first like two little wrinkles just in terms of what they've claimed before the campaign was reached out to by The Wall Street Journal up right before the election back in 2016 and asked about those payments because the Wall Street Journal had found out that something had happened hole pick said we have no knowledge of any of this and said that Miss MacDougall's claim of an affair was totally untrue well we don't have proof of the affair just yet but they clearly did know about it and so they have been lying about that that was ongoing for a couple of years at this point and I just think this is funny in reaction to the story today a president apparently the president said I can't believe Michael would do this to me yeah like with me technically that's what weird way to say that but so my question though is there there are ways theoretically this that crimes could have been committed so there's the legal and the ethical aspects which are sort of separate this is explosive but how likely is this in either of those two areas to actually matter more than a week into the future so to Joe's earlier point people are just set in their ways we're done with it right so the Republic 80% of Republicans will not move no matter what and and even if it turns out the Bechard story is true if right and trump paid for an abortion but God works in mysterious ways and of course the guy who is the most immoral person on the planet according to our own ideology is the one that he would choose to be our leader right but this but they'll believe it don't believe it so but in and progressives already hate Trump but hold on real quick just ten seconds but the the second component to that story if that story is true that then broidy is how we say yes that then he was given favors and defense contracts for stepping up and taking that payment and he's been the middleman in these deals before that's a that's a crime that everyone understands that will make it that what that one would make it tricky for Lanny day for not for Lanny Davis for Lindsey Graham yeah and then so but that's a great point by man look the Republican voters will not move I look I give you an example we talked about on the show before Scott Desjarlais he's in Tennessee these are lay is a congressman turns out he paid for three abortions not one not two three two with his wife I believe in one with his mistress or two with his mistress one with his wife it's hard to keep up with all the abortions that he has paid for and the voters like God works in mysterious ways who cares we don't care about it but when we just lying we just kidding I just hate immigrants I don't care I don't care so will they care about Donald Trump's abortion no the voters will not care at all they never cared it was always a lie right the politicians well okay maybe they they have to make some uncork uncomfortable sentences like I'm very opposed to abortion but love Donald Trump they could walk that tight line they've been doing it for two years now but okay here it is here's a 1.6 million dollar payoff if okay one poison pay off are the Republicans gonna go yeah I don't care I don't care it's obviously illegal disguise an obvious criminal and but I'll lose my primary I vote without tell you one thing I don't know that turns out to be true Jeff Flake is gonna take to Twitter he's going to be pretty angry yeah I yeah I think they'll be perfectly fine with that I mean they got past Monday well that's a real fine stop just saying that there's there we are entering into an area where the potential no more than a potential where there are serious unambiguous crimes right I mean a big part as you know Jake your lawyer like a lot of you know you kill somebody that's a crime right but a lot of these crimes are no that's not a crime my intent was this and then you argue it and that's why we have a that's why there's no we may in and enter into unambiguous territory and that will put a different kind of pressure on all Republicans and as always as we get closer to Election Day you know though when they if they feel like there's an advantage to separate themselves from him then they will separate himself and by the way don't get me wrong I think they will I think that Trump is a disaster but also from a management perspective and I would be really surprised if the markets didn't tumble at some point because of the tariffs or the just the overinflated stock market because of the insane tax cuts etc and the minute the markets suffered the donors will flip which will make the Republican politicians flip but that's your only hope not like they develop a conscious or that the Republican voters care and it's a hope that would be absolutely devastating yeah but there is some percentage of that 80% make up a number that's persuadable give me a number three okay gonna go with eight but we'll take six okay all right 6% oh and there isn't there's a whole giant swath of Democratic operatives who will run an entire campaign on the off chance that they can get that four and a half or so running that have just been like you know there's 60 percent of the other people let's just get them yeah instead of running on corruption which is another story in the news today it turns out we were right about that all along number one pain issue I can tell you that for seven straight years anyway and number two is I love this phrasing that are across here Cortez used I cannot make dignity you run on that and you'll crush these guys so Trump is a monster of a different sort and there are legal proceedings and investigators let them do their job okay that's it to me that's a separate issue okay well but
