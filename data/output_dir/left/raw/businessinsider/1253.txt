1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
I don't give a damn what the president

United States wants to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> or anybody</font>

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,480

there's no judge in America<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,269
wouldn't say they're in violation of the

6
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:33,059
law because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's specifically in law now</font>

7
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:35,670
prohibited so I don't give a damn what

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:47,280
enough they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

13

<font color="#E5E5E5">what a pudding absolutely fine but we</font>

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,640

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,290
waterboarding that's the way I feel

25
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,320
