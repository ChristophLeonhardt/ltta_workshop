WORKS JUST FINE AT THE HOTEL IN
SINGAPORE THIS MORNING.
>> MARTHA, THAT'S RIGHT.
THIS DRAMATIC MEETING IS NOW
LESS THAN TWO HOURS AWAY AND THE
STAKES COULD NOT BE ANY HIGHER.
IT WAS MERE MONTHS AGO THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS WARNING OF
FIRE AND FURY TO RESPOND TO U.S.
INTEL OFFICIALS WARNING THAT
NORTH KOREA MAY HAVE THE ABILITY
TO MINIATURIZE NUCLEAR WARHEADS
ONTO MISSILES THAT COULD REACH
THE CONTINENTAL U.S.
THAT'S WHY THE STAKES COULD NOT
BE HIGHER.
TONIGHT HERE IN SINGAPORE,
THERE'S OPTIMISM IN THE AIR AS
THE PRESIDENT HAS DECLARED HE
WAS ON A MISSION OF PEACE.
HE JUST TWEETED THAT THE PREGAME
MEETINGS ARE GOING WELL SAYING
"MEETINGS BETWEEN STAFFS AND
REPRESENTATIVES ARE GOING WELL
AND QUICKLY, BUT IN THE END THAT
DOESN'T MATTER.
WE WILL ALL KNOW SOON WHETHER OR
NOT A REAL DEAL UNLIKE THOSE OF
THE PAST CAN HAPPEN."
THAT TWEET AND THE ONE LIKE YOU
MENTIONED APPEARED TO BE AIMED
IN PART AT THE PRESIDENT -- A
DEAL COULD BE FALLING APART
BECAUSE KIM JONG UN AIDES TOLD
THE WHITE HOUSE THE DICTATOR IS
PLANNING TO LEAVE JUST A FEW
HOURS AFTER THE SUMMIT KICKS
OFF.
THE PRESIDENT HAD LEFT OPEN THE
POSSIBILITY OF STAYING TO EXTEND
THE SUMMIT TO A SECOND DAY.
HE TOO IS NOT PLANNING TO LEAVE
JUST HOURS AFTER THIS GETS
GOING, BUT I'M THINKING UP FROM
SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS THAT THE
SCHEDULE IS STILL FLUID AND IF
THEY NEED TO THEY COULD ADD A
SECOND DAY, COULD CHANGE AGAIN,
THE U.S. SIDE IS CONFIDENT THEY
CAN STILL GET THE FRAMEWORK OF A
DEAL DONE IN THIS NARROW WINDOW
OF TIME.
IT ALL STARTS WITH A 45 MINUTE
ONE-ON-ONE MEETING BETWEEN THE
PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN KIM, JUST
THE TWO LEADERS, NO STAFF EXCEPT
FOR TRANSLATORS.
THEN 10:00 P.M. EASTERN, THIS
MEETING EXPANDS TO INCLUDE
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO.
HE HAS MET WITH KIM TWICE.
JOHN KELLY AND JOHN BOLTON.
THEN AT 11:30 P.M. EASTERN THE
PRESIDENT AND THAT CORE GROUP
WILL BE JOINED BY MORE
WHITE HOUSE AIDES FOR A WORKING
LUNCH WITH THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE
SINCE IT WILL BE MIDDAY TUESDAY
HERE, WORKING LUNCH SET UP LIKE
THE
THE PRESIDENTS MILL YESTERDAY
WITH THE PRIME MINISTER OF
SINGAPORE.
THESE CONVERSATIONS GO ON FOR
HOURS AND THEN THE TWO NATIONS
GO THEIR SEPARATE WAYS.
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ABLE TO GO
BACK TO THE HOTEL WITH HIS TEAM,
ASSESS WHERE THEY ARE AND THEN
HE'S CLAIMING A SOLO NEWS
CONFERENCE AT 4:00 A.M. EASTERN
TIME SEVEN HOURS AFTER THE
SUMMIT BEGINS.
JIM SEEMED VERY LOOSE IN THE
TALKS.
SIGHTSEEING, A STOP AT A CASINO.
ASSIGN HE IS EAGER TO SEE WHAT
HE CAN GAIN ECONOMICALLY FROM A
DEAL COULD BUT POMPEO WORN TODAY
WHILE THERE ARE ECONOMIC
INCENTIVES ON THE TABLE THE U.S.
IS NOT PULLING BACK ON TOP
SANCTIONS UNTIL THEY GET A FIRM
DENUCLEARIZATION FROM
NORTH KOREA.
>> SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN UNTIL
NORTH KOREA COMPLETELY AND
VERIFY ELIMINATES ITS WEAPONS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION'S PROGRAM.
IF THE FORM AS HE DOES NOT MOVE
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND WE
ARE HOPEFUL THE CONTINUED TO DO
SO, THOSE MEASURES WILL INCREASE
SO, THOSE MEASURES WILL INCREAS
INCREASE.
>> THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE
DESPITE THE NAYSAYERS.
SAYING THERE'S NO CHANCE OF A
DEAL.
BACK LAST AUGUST WARM WAS ON
HIGH ALERT AS NORTH KOREAN
MISSILES MORNING THEY MIGHT USE
MEDIUM OR LONG-RANGE MISSILES TO
ATTACK U.S. MILITARY PERSONNEL
AND THEIR FAMILIES, OTHERS THAT
ARE IN WARM.
THERE WERE FIERCE THIS COULD BE
THE START OF A NUCLEAR CONFLICT.
HERE WE ARE NOW, MARTHA, JUST A
FEW MONTHS LATER, LESS THAN TWO
HOURS AWAY FROM THE START OF
