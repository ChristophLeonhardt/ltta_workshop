“So, at the end of the year,
Nikki will be leaving,
and we’ll be
in constant touch.
I know that whenever
you have any ideas,
you’re going to call me,
because you know
all the players.”
President Trump accepted
Nikki Haley’s resignation
as ambassador
to the United Nations.
He appointed Haley
just weeks after winning
the presidential
election.
“It has been an honor
of a lifetime.”
She first served under
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson,
who preferred
behind-the-scenes diplomacy,
allowing Haley to step in as
the public face of
U.S. foreign policy.
Haley became a regular on the
Sunday political talk shows.
“And Jerusalem is where
the prime minister is,
the president is, the
Parliament, the Supreme Court.
It makes sense for
our embassy to be there.”
But one appearance caused a
rift with the administration.
In April, Haley announced
there would be
tougher sanctions on Russia
for supporting
Syria’s Bashar al-Assad.
This apparently caught
Trump off guard,
and one official said
Haley was perhaps confused.
“In the last half-hour,
I was able to get in
touch with Nikki Haley
and she said, quote,
‘With all due respect,
I don’t get confused.’”
Haley also championed
controversial policy decisions
on the world stage.
She slashed funds to the
Palestinian aid agency,
withdrew from the
Human Rights Council
and made her opposition
to Iran her signature goal.
In December, Haley staged
a presentation of missiles
at a military base in
Washington, accusing
Iran of providing weapons
to Houthi rebels in Yemen.
“The weapons might
as well have had
‘Made in Iran’ stickers
all over it.”
Her evidence fell short,
but it served as a step
in the Trump
administration’s effort
to punish Iran
for its activities
throughout the Middle East.
“I, Michael Richard Pompeo …”
When Mike Pompeo became
secretary of state
and John Bolton,
national security adviser,
they took a more
public approach,
and Haley became
less influential.
Bolton became more
involved with issues
in Haley’s portfolio,
like Iran and the
International Criminal Court.
Haley had many
successes of her own,
including passing sweeping
sanctions on North Korea
and imposing an arms
embargo on South Sudan.
“Look at what has happened
in two years with
the United States
on foreign policy.
Now, the United States
is respected.
Countries may not
like what we do,
but they respect
what we do.”
And Haley was widely respected
by her diplomatic colleagues,
even those from
nations who disagreed
with this administration’s
foreign policy decisions.
Many in the U.N. saw Haley
as a reasonable figure
in an otherwise
unpredictable administration —
and are closely watching
who might succeed her.
