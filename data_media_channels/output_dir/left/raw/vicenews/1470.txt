00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:11,518
Well, I'd like to think other
presidents feel the same way,

516
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:14,721
but I can tell you
I feel it... acutely.

517
00:25:14,756 --> 00:25:17,224
When I moved to Chicago 
 and I started doing

518
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,626
community organizing 
 in low-income neighborhoods,

519
00:25:19,662 --> 00:25:23,363
one of the most 
 powerful thoughts that I had

520
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,601
was driving
by street corners, uh,

521
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:31,004
with kids who at that stage--
I was in my early 20s--

522
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,275
really weren't that
far off from where I was,

523
00:25:35,311 --> 00:25:39,246
and knowing that
the mistakes they made

524
00:25:39,281 --> 00:25:43,483
would land them,
potentially, in prison...

525
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,786
in ways that just were not true
for me, growing up in Hawaii.

526
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:50,156
The notion that you or I...

527
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:53,827
couldn't have easily
been drawn into that,

528
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:56,230
that somehow
we wouldn't have fallen prey

529
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,797
to the temptations
of the streets--

530
00:25:57,833 --> 00:26:02,202
that doesn't feel right to me.
That doesn't feel true.

531
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:05,305
Smith:  The president didn't just want
to talk about the problem, though.

532
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:07,307
He wanted to speak 
 directly to the people

533
00:26:07,343 --> 00:26:10,544
who were doing time 
 as a result of it.

534
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:12,546
So he asked to sit down 
 with six inmates

535
00:26:12,581 --> 00:26:17,384
for an unprecedented, 
 unfiltered conversation.

536

00:26:50,286 --> 00:26:52,552
about the reason for my visit.

551
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:57,123
One of my concerns
has been how...

552
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,893
we're dealing with
nonviolent drug offenses--

553
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:02,496
the levels of incarceration
have gone way up,

554
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:05,165
the length of sentences
increased significantly--

555
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,934
whether the sentencing
and the price

556
00:27:07,969 --> 00:27:10,804
that not only
individuals are paying,

557
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,775
but their families for the mistakes
they make, are proportional,

558
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,711
and whether we need
to make some changes.

559
00:27:17,746 --> 00:27:20,480
And I'm also interested
in figuring out,

560
00:27:20,516 --> 00:27:24,184
as people get released,
whether they've got the tools

561
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:27,053
they need to be able to stay
on the straight and narrow

562
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,989
or whether the temptation
is to go back on the streets

563
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,558
and then end up back here.

564
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:35,595
So, my hope was to just have
folks share their stories.

565
00:27:35,631 --> 00:27:38,565

This is really kind of
a touchy subject for me.

849
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:46,879
My father was in prison.
He had life in the feds.

Also, I'm in prison,
then on top of that,

00:41:51,786 --> 00:41:55,921
I have sons. Two of my
sons went to prison.

852
00:41:55,956 --> 00:41:59,492
So they followed the same
footprints as I did with my father.

853
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:02,428
Nobody was there for them.
With that being said,

854
00:42:02,463 --> 00:42:04,763
we need to be there
for our family.

and some of the successes
that I had educational wise,

976
00:48:06,027 --> 00:48:08,661
I felt like I couldn't take
advice from others,

977
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:10,529
because they weren't
as successful as me.

978
00:48:10,565 --> 00:48:13,599
It hindered many

979
00:48:13,634 --> 00:48:17,036

who wanted to help me,

980
00:48:17,071 --> 00:48:19,705
individuals who
could benefit me,

981
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,240

right now at this time.

982
00:48:22,276 --> 00:48:26,111

00:48:26,146 --> 00:48:28,513
I've examined some
of my thinking patterns,

984
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:30,482
and I wanted to be
a part of something,

985
00:48:30,517 --> 00:48:33,418
and there was nothing available.
Mm-hmm.

986
00:48:33,454 --> 00:48:36,021
How much of that thinking relates
to programs here in the prison?

987
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:38,924
How much of it is just you
being in your cell

988
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,159
and kind of having to think
through where you are?

989
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:42,695
Well, I think the core of it

990
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,798
is the program in here
at the institution.

991
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:49,635
I found myself in prison.

992
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:51,436
Yeah, I found myself in prison.

993
00:48:52,473 --> 00:48:54,740
Is there anything that, uh,

994
00:48:56,443 --> 00:49:02,014
you think about or worry about
as you leave and readjust?

995
00:49:02,049 --> 00:49:05,217
Because one of the things that
we're always concerned about is...

996
00:49:05,252 --> 00:49:08,821
The recidivism rate is, I'll be
honest with you, it's pretty high.

997
00:49:08,856 --> 00:49:13,859
50% of folks who get released,
they're back in a year later.

998
00:49:13,894 --> 00:49:18,097
So part of what we're really spending
some time doing is thinking about,

999
00:49:18,132 --> 00:49:19,965
"How do we make
that transition effective?"

1000
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:22,001
You guys have
a good mindset now,

1001
00:49:22,036 --> 00:49:25,403
but then you get back out, you go
on a couple of job interviews,

1002
00:49:25,439 --> 00:49:28,173
it gets discouraging...

1003
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:30,275
your old friends
call you back...

1004
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:33,545
"Yo, what's up?
Why don't you come on over?"

1005
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,880
Right?
Absolutely.

1006
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:37,282
And it's easy to fall back
into the old patterns.

1007
00:49:37,317 --> 00:49:40,185

no matter what your party,

1177

upon your consciousness.

1178

1179

 Now Senator Booker brings

1181

a unique perspective 
 to the fight.

1182
00:57:57,484 --> 00:57:59,217
He's the former mayor of Newark,

1183
00:57:59,253 --> 00:58:00,752
a city that has 
 struggled with crime

1184
00:58:00,787 --> 00:58:02,987
and incarceration for decades.

This is where you used to live
here when you were Mayor?

1187
00:58:07,261 --> 00:58:09,894
Yeah.
And why choose to live here?

1188
00:58:09,929 --> 00:58:11,663
Booker: So, we looked at
the sectors in the city.

1189
00:58:11,698 --> 00:58:12,897
This was one
with the most shootings,

1190
00:58:12,932 --> 00:58:14,499
so I wanted to move into an area

1191
00:58:14,535 --> 00:58:16,201
where we could make
a difference.

1192
00:58:16,236 --> 00:58:19,204
And I knew that as a mayor, you're
gonna have 24-hour security,

1193
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:21,239
so why not have it in a
community that really needs it.

1194
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:24,108
I feel so connected to this
city because Newark is showing

1195
00:58:24,144 --> 00:58:25,777
the best of what America can be.

1196
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:28,180
That grit, that strength that
we respect about our country,

1197
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:29,981
but it also shows
the darker parts

1198
00:58:30,016 --> 00:58:31,616
of our nation that we don't
want to talk about...

1199
00:58:31,652 --> 00:58:33,851
Sure.
...where we've gone way off the rails,

1200
00:58:33,887 --> 00:58:36,521
that's unnecessary,
hyper-expensive,

1201
00:58:36,557 --> 00:58:38,256
and violates our values.

1202
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,127
So, you have Republicans,
you have Democrats,

1203
00:58:43,163 --> 00:58:45,763
you have the president,
you have general consensus

1204
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:49,133
that reform is needed.
What's holding it up?

1205
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:51,203
So, you know
I'm new in the Senate...

1206
00:58:51,238 --> 00:58:53,037
Right.
...and when I was mayor of the city,

1207
00:58:53,073 --> 00:58:54,939
when we would see
things like, you know,

1208
00:58:54,974 --> 00:58:56,974
we wanted to build
this park right here...

1209
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:59,377
that kids are playing in. And we built a park.
Right. Right.

1210
00:58:59,413 --> 00:59:02,880
And the challenge with the federal
legislature is it moves a lot slower.

1211
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:05,083
We need a far more
comprehensive focus,

1212
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:07,519
and we need to move
with a sense of urgency.

1213
00:59:08,655 --> 00:59:10,388
And we have to think
about how many guys,

1214
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:12,724
who are coming back from prison,
come back with no hope,

1215
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:14,392
believe that there's
no opportunities.

1216
00:59:14,428 --> 00:59:16,695
I think it was James Baldwin who said,
"There's nothing more dangerous

1217
00:59:16,730 --> 00:59:18,830
"than a man that believes
he has no hope."

1218
00:59:18,865 --> 00:59:21,132
And we see this-- almost two-thirds
of the people coming out

1219
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:23,835
end up going right
back down that slope.

1220
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,437
Smith:  One business 
 owner we met

1221
00:59:25,472 --> 00:59:27,805
told us how hard it's been 
 for him to stay clear

1222
00:59:27,841 --> 00:59:31,209
of the legal system, 
 even after serving his time.

1223
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:32,877
Booker: So, most of
the fellas you know

1224
00:59:32,912 --> 00:59:35,213
got involved in really
low-level stuff, right?

1225
00:59:35,249 --> 00:59:37,014
And they get
that criminal conviction,

1226
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,484
and then it's a trap, right?
How hard is it to get out?

1227
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:41,886
What are you talking about?
We're still trying to get out, man.

1228
00:59:41,921 --> 00:59:44,422
I still got ties to the system.

1229
00:59:44,458 --> 00:59:46,858
I'm still paying.
For any crime you do,

1230
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:49,761
you're gonna pay a stipend.
You know what I'm saying?

1231
00:59:49,796 --> 00:59:51,563
You come out of jail,
you paid your debt,

1232
00:59:51,598 --> 00:59:53,278
but you really--
you haven't pay your debt,

1233
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,166
'cause you got thousands
of dollars worth of fines.

1234
00:59:55,201 --> 00:59:57,269
- Exactly. - What happens if you don't
pay the fines down?

1235
00:59:57,304 --> 00:59:59,537
We get relocked up.

1236
00:59:59,573 --> 01:00:01,239
Smith:
 Now these fees may vary,

1237
01:00:01,275 --> 01:00:03,308
but almost every state 
 requires offenders

1238
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:05,410
to pay for part 
 of the legal process,

1239
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:07,912
like room and board 
 or probation costs.

1240
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:11,349
Some states even make you pay
for your public defender.

1241
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:14,118
Randell was living 
 in Philadelphia

1242
01:00:14,154 --> 01:00:16,120
when he was picked up 
 for dealing drugs.

1243
01:00:16,156 --> 01:00:18,890
And after serving his time, 
 he couldn't find a job

1244
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:21,859
and fell badly behind 
 on his fees.

1245
01:00:21,895 --> 01:00:23,528
I moved back to Philadelphia.

1246
01:00:23,563 --> 01:00:26,398
It's like hard getting jobs
and stuff down there,

1247
01:00:26,433 --> 01:00:28,400
so I just went back
to what I was doing.

1248
01:00:28,435 --> 01:00:31,403
I was selling drugs,
and I got put up.

1249
01:00:31,438 --> 01:00:33,371
You go to see your
parole officer

1250
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,007
and you don't have money,
they will hold you.

1251
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:38,843
Job or no job, and if you don't
pay, you come back to jail.

1252
01:00:38,878 --> 01:00:41,579
Yeah.
I know one thing, I found myself selling drugs

1253
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:46,017
to pay back Pennsylvania.
Damn! Yeah, that's-- that's bad.

1254
01:00:46,052 --> 01:00:48,520
So my original max
of three and a half to seven

1255
01:00:48,555 --> 01:00:52,357
turned into, like,
seven and a half to 15.

1256
01:00:52,392 --> 01:00:54,258
(laughs) Yeah, just...

1257
01:00:54,294 --> 01:00:57,228
keep you on parole forever.
You'll never get off.

1258
01:01:00,567 --> 01:01:03,901
McCall was asking about you last weekend.
Again?

1259
01:01:03,937 --> 01:01:06,338
Yes. I guess
it's kind of hard for them

1260
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:09,808
to get a grasp
of you being away.

1261
01:01:09,843 --> 01:01:13,211
Man. Plus, they don't
think I'm in jail.

1262
01:01:13,246 --> 01:01:16,113
No, 'cause he believes
that you're at work.

1263
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:21,353
Ahh. Yeah.
Yeah.

1264
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:25,590
It's sad.
Yeah.

1265
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:28,660
Smith:  Many offenders can end up
thousands of dollars in debt,

1266
01:01:28,695 --> 01:01:31,696
making it nearly impossible
for those who can't find work

1267
01:01:31,732 --> 01:01:34,265

 says that they owe.

1268
01:01:35,535 --> 01:01:37,369
And on top of all that, 
 in many states,

1271
01:01:42,041 --> 01:01:44,008
effectively stripping them 
 of the support

1272
01:01:44,043 --> 01:01:46,310

 to rebuild their lives.

1273

Seven.

Four years.
Four years. I had little jobs.

1276

I had one job making $5 an hour,
then I got a raise to $5.25.

1277
01:01:57,156 --> 01:02:01,325
I sold soap, pencils,
