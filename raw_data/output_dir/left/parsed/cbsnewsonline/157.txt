THE SIGNING WAS NOT ON THE 
AGENDA, BUT PERHAPS DURING THE 
COURSE OF THESE MEETINGS, THE 
LUNCH, THE ONE-ON-ONE MEETING, 
THE PRESIDENT HAD WITH THE 
CHAIRMAN, PERHAPS THEY CAME TO 
SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT, AND 
THAT AGREEMENT IS GOING TO BE 
ON DISPLAY FOR THE ENTIRE WORLD 
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
MINUTES, WE ARE TOLD THAT THE 
PRESS POOL, TRACKING WHAT WE 
ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW, IS 
GATHERING FOR SOMETHING, WE 
WILL HAVE TO SEE. 
>> THIS SHOWS THE ADVANTAGES 
AND DISADVANTAGES OF DISSIDENT 
-- DICTATORSHIPS. 
HE CAN SIGN WHATEVER HE WANTS, 
AND A MUCH TIGHTER SHIP, SO 
LITTLE INFORMATION, INFORMATION 
ON WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE 
COUNTRY, ON THE OTHER HAND, WE 
WILL SEE WHAT COMES OUT IN THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES IF 
ANYTHING, IF NOTHING ELSE COMES 
OUT, AT 4 PM SINGAPORE TIME, IT 
IS GOING TO BE TRUMP TALKING TO 
REPORTERS, HE WILL PAINT THE 
NARRATIVE AS HE WANTS, KIM JONG-
UN IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE, 
HE'S NOT GOING TO EXPLAIN WHAT 
HIS SIDE OF THE STORY IS, IT 
WILL CERTAINLY DIFFER FROM 
TRUMP SIDE IN CERTAIN KEY WAYS. 
>> ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING, AND 
ALL OF US ARE EAGERLY AWAITING 
TO SEE WHAT THE SIGNING IS, AND 
IF WE WILL ACTUALLY SEE THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND KIM JONG-UN SITTING AT A 
TABLE, THERE WE GO, A LIVE 
PICTURE COMING FROM THE PRESS 
POOL, AND TWO CHAIRS, THE NORTH 
KOREAN AND AMERICAN FLAGS, THE 
CHIEF OF STAFF, JOHN KELLY, WE 
SEE THE SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 
POMPEO, JOHN BOLTON, THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THE 
NORTH KOREA DELEGATION IS NOT, 
IS FAR AS I CAN TELL, IN THE 
ROOM JUST YET, BUT THAT IS 
GOING TO CHANGE IN THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF MINUTES AS WE WATCH 
REPORTERS GATHERING, THERE IS A 
NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL RIGHT 
THERE. 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. 
>> THIS IS REMARKABLE. 
>> AND HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT 
THE NORTH KOREAN FLAG AND THE 
AMERICAN FLAG ARE THE SAME 
COLORS? 
>> A LOT OF COUNTRIES LIKE THE 
RED WHITE BLUE. 
-- THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE.
>> THE SHOT THAT WE ARE SHOWING 
TO VIEWERS, THE REPORTERS IN 
THE PRESS POOL, SETTING UP FOR 
THIS MOMENT, THIS SIGNING, THAT 
THE PRESIDENT ALLUDED TO JUST 
MOMENTS AGO, AND WE DON'T KNOW 
WHAT THIS IS YET, BUT THIS 
COULD BE A FUNCTION ABOUT WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT SAID OVER THE 
WEEKEND, HE SAID WITHIN A 
MINUTE OR 60 SECONDS, HE WOULD 
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT CHAIRMAN 
KIM WAS SERIOUS ABOUT 
NEGOTIATING, BASED ON HIS GUT, 
BASED ON HIS BUSINESS ACUMEN, 
THAT HAS PROPELLED HIM TO 
SUCCESS, HE WOULD BE ABLE TO 
KNOW, WHAT CHAIRMAN KIM'S 
INTENTIONS WERE, AND IT LOOKS 
LIKE NORTH -- NORTH KOREAN 
SECURITY. 
>> IT LOOKS LIKE WHITE HOUSE 
STAFFERS THAT ARE PUSHING THE 
MORON, ARE AGGRESSIVE, WATCH 
THE NORTH KOREANS DO THIS. 
>> THE ENTIRE PROCESS, 
FASCINATING, THE WEIGHT IS 
PLAYED OUT IN PUBLIC CALLING IT 
AGAIN THEY WE DON'T -- THEY 
HAPPEN AND WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
THEM, TO SEE MOMENTS LIKE THIS, 
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING SPEAK -- 
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING. 
>> LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HEAR 
WHAT IS GOING ON. 
>> PLEASE GO BACK.
>> WHERE DO YOU WANT ME?
>> YOU CAN HERE, THERE IS A 
LIVE NEGOTIATION GOING ON 
BETWEEN THE PRESS POOL AND THE 
NORTH KOREAN HANDLERS HERE. 
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED 
IN THE BUSINESS OF NEWS, THIS 
IS HOW IT HAPPENS, AND I AM 
SURE FOR THE NORTH KOREANS, 
THIS IS SOMETHING THEY ARE NOT 
USED TO, AN AGGRESSIVE PRESS 
CORPS, THAT HAS THE RIGHT TO 
COVER NEWS EVENTS, INCLUDING 
THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, 
AND THESE GUYS, YOU CAN SEE 
THEY ARE WEARING NORTH KOREAN 
PINS, TRYING TO DICTATE HOW 
THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT. 
AND WE DID SEE THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR, JOHN BOLTON, 
GOING INTO THOSE DOORS, BEHIND 
THOSE MEN THERE, AND WE EXPECT 
THAT IS WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS. 
THIS IS REMARKABLE.
>> OF COURSE THEY DON'T WANT A 
CONFRONTATION WITH JOURNALISTS, 
ONE U.S. OFFICIAL SAID THAT YOU 
CAN'T BE HERE, BUT HARD TO 
IMAGINE ANYTHING ESCALATING 
FROM THERE. 
THIS IS POSSIBLY THE STORY OF A 
LIFETIME FOR THESE JOURNALISTS, 
THEY WANT TO BE AS CLOSE AS 
POSSIBLE. 
>> SOMEONE JUST SAID THIS IS A 
MESS OVER HERE.>> AND IT COULD 
BE, GENTLEMEN, BECAUSE IT DOES 
NOT FEEL SPONTANEOUS, FLAGS IN 
THE TABLE ARE THERE, ON THE 
OTHER HAND, GIVEN THE SHAMBOLIC 
NATURE OF WHAT WE ARE 
WITNESSING, PERHAPS IT IS A 
SPONTANEOUS ACTION.
>> WE CAN SEE THE WAY THEY ARE 
INTERACTING, THE HANDS FLYING 
IN FROM THE SCREEN, IT DOESN'T 
FEEL SCRIPTED AT ALL.
>> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY 
FASCINATING.
>> I WONDER IF THEY WANT THE 
PRESS BEHIND A CERTAIN LINE, IF 
THERE IS A RULE ABOUT HOW FAR 
MEDIA IS ALLOWED TO BE.
>> HE IS INDICATING THIS LINE. 
>>> WHAT YOU ARE WITNESSING 
HERE ON CBSN IS FASCINATING, 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, LESS THAN AN HOUR AGO, 
A HALF HOUR AGO, AS HE WAS 
LEAVING THE WORKING LUNCH WITH 
CHAIRMAN KIM INDICATED WHAT 
THEY WERE GOING TO WAS A 
SIGNING, IT LOOKED TO US THAT 
THIS WAS AN UNSCRIPTED MOMENT, 
THE PRESIDENT INDICATING THAT 
THERE WAS A SIGNING, IT LOOKED 
LIKE CHAIRMAN KIM WAS HEADING 
TO HIS VEHICLE, THE PRESIDENT 
ENGAGED HIM, AS DID THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR JOHN 
BOLTON, AND THE PRESS WAS 
USHERED INTO THIS ROOM, AND 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
MOVEMENT BETWEEN THE NORTH 
KOREAN HANDLERS AND THE 
AMERICAN HANDLERS IN THE PRESS, 
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT 
RIGHT NOW, THE LIVE FEED IN 
SINGAPORE OF REPORTERS SETTING 
UP FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED WAS A 
SIGNING OF SOME SORT. 
ONE REPORTER SAID THEY DON'T 
KNOW WHAT THE SIGNING IS, 
ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING AS WE 
WATCH THIS UNFOLD. 
LET'S JUST WATCH. 
>>> THAT WAS A REMARKABLE 
MOMENT, WHATEVER THAT NORTH 
KOREAN OFFICIAL DID, THAT IS 
THE PEN FOR CHAIRMAN KIM, HE 
DID NOT TOUCH PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 
PEN, THE LEFT SIDE OF THE 
SCREEN. 
SO WE ARE IN COMMUNICATIONS 
WITH ZEKE MILLER, THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTER, 
TRAVELING WITH THE DELEGATION 
THERE, AND SEEK IS IN THIS 
ROOM, A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH, 
WHERE THE PRESS CAN STAND, IF 
YOU HAVE BEEN WITH US FOR THE 
LAST 10 MINUTES OR SO, YOU CAN 
SEE THE NORTH KOREANS WERE 
BEING AGGRESSIVE, THE PRESS CAN 
STAND AS THE PRESS ALWAYS 
STUDIES THAT IS WHAT WE DO, WE 
WOULD BE REPORTERS, A LOT OF 
JOSTLING, HANDWAVING, AND SORT 
OF FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
INTERESTED IN HOW THE SAUSAGE 
OF NEWS IS MADE, THE TWO 
LEADERS THAT WILL WALK OUT, THE 
MOMENTS THAT HAPPEN BEFORE, AND 
HERE COMES THE NORTH KOREAN 
OFFICIAL AGAIN. 
>> A LITTLE BIT MORE FRUSTRATED 
THIS TIME.
>> REMEMBER, THIS GUY, HIS JOB, 
IF IS ONE JOB IS TO KEEP THE 
REPORTERS PAST DAY CERTAIN 
LINE, GIVEN THE REGIME AND WHAT 
THEY DO TO PEOPLE. 
EXACTLY, BETTER GET IT RIGHT.
>> THIS IS A REMARKABLE MOMENT, 
CLEARLY UNSCRIPTED, WHAT DO YOU 
THINK THAT XI JINGPING IS 
THINKING AS HE'S WATCHING THIS 
ON CBSN? 
>> I'M SURE HE IS A BIG FAN, HE 
IS PROBABLY -- >> DO YOU THINK 
HE KNOWS WHAT THIS COULD BE? 
>> I DON'T THINK HE DOES, 
YOU'VE GOT TO IMAGINE THAT 
SOMEBODY IS BUGGING THESE 
ROOMS, WHETHER IT IS SINGAPORE, 
AMERICA, NORTH KOREA, CHINESE, 
THAT PEOPLE HAVE YEARS INSIDE 
THIS BUILDING, IT OBVIOUSLY -- 
IT ALMOST FEELS TO OBVIOUS NOT 
TO, I THINK IF HE AND KIM JONG-
UN HAD PLANNED BEFORE HAND WHAT 
-- HOW MUCH ROPE HE WAS ALLOWED 
TO GIVE, FROM CHINA, THEY HAD 
DISCUSSED BEFORE HAND, WHAT HE 
WAS ALLOWED TO GIVE, THEN 
PERHAPS HE DOES KNOW, AND 
PERHAPS HE IS A BIT NERVOUS 
WHETHER OR NOT KIM WILL FOLLOW 
THE ORDERS WHICH HE SAID FOR 
IM. 
>> THAT IS REMARKABLE, AS WE 
DISCUSSED EARLIER, THE NORTH 
KOREANS MET WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, 
MEETING WITH XI JINGPING, OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS,  ONE 
WOULD HAVE TO WONDER IF THERE 
WERE INSTRUCTIONS, OR GUIDANCE, 
AS TO WHAT THEY COULD AND COULD 
NOT ACCEPT, AS FAR AS WHAT THE 
U.S. DEMANDS WERE, AND THIS MAY 
BE A MOMENT WE ARE SINGING -- 
WE ARE SEEING THAT THE CHINESE 
ARE NOT EXPECTING. 
>> PROBABLY FOR XI JINGPING, 
YOU WANTED THIS TO GO AS 
QUICKLY AND SMOOTHLY AS 
POSSIBLE, WITH NO SURPRISES,  
IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A PRETTY 
BIG CURVEBALL HERE, IF VIEWERS 
HAD NOT SEEN THE PICTURE OF 
KIM, TRUMP AND BOLTON PRODDING 
EACH OTHER EARLIER, TOTALLY 
UNSCRIPTED IT SEEMS, THAT SEEMS 
TO HAVE LED TO THIS ROOM WHERE 
THE PRESS HAS BEEN USHERED 
INTO. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WAS NOT 
EXPECTED, FOR XI JINGPING, FOR 
KIM JONG-UN, AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, IT IS HARD TO KNOW. 
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE THE 
CONSTERNATION THAT IS HAPPENING 
IN TOKYO AT THIS MOMENT, IN 
SEOUL, AND BEIJING, AS THEY SIT 
HERE WATCHING WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING IN FULL BEFORE HER EYES, 
WONDERING WHAT IS GOING ON. 
WE COULD BE WRONG, EVERYONE IS 
ON THE SAME PAGE, AND EVERYONE 
KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, 
BUT GIVEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN, 
SURMISING BASED ON JUST THE 
NATURE OF WHAT WE HAVE JUST 
WITNESSED OVER THE LAST HALF 
HOUR, PHONE CALLS HAPPENING, 
WHAT IS GOING ON, WHAT ARE YOU 
DOING, WHAT IS THE SIGNING? 
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
IT, AND HERE WE ARE. 
>> THE DRUM AT THESE MOMENTS IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
THE TENSION OF HAVING THE NORTH 
KOREAN GUARD GO AND CLEAN THE 
PEN. 
THAT KIM JONG-UN PRESUMABLY IS 
GOING TO SIGN SOMETHING, 
WHETTING OUR APPETITE FOR 
KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT IS GOING 
TO HAPPEN.
>> AND IF INDEED THIS WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS PERHAPS NOT 
PLANNED, THE QUESTION BECOMES 
OF COURSE, THIS WOULD BE 
SOMETHING THAT IS PLANNED BY 
THE U.S., BUT NOT IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THE NORTH 
KOREANS, THE PRESIDENT JUST 
MADE THIS COMMENT, EVERYBODY 
LOOKED AROUND AND SAID WHAT IS 
HE TALKING ABOUT, AND HERE WE 
ARE, AND SO NOT WANTING TO LOSE 
FACE IS ONE THING, FROM 
CHAIRMAN KIM, BUT SIGNING 
SOMETHING, IS A WHOLE ANOTHER 
KIT AND CABOODLE. 
>> TRUMP DREW A LOT OF FLAK FOR 
HIS COMMENTS ABOUT I WILL KNOW 
IN A MINUTE HOW I FEEL ABOUT 
KIM JONG-UN, BUT MOMENTS LIKE 
THESE ARE A REPORT -- IMPORTANT 
REMINDER THAT THESE PRECIOUS 
MOMENTS DO REALLY MATTER.
>> WE WILL RECALL THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SIX MONTHS AGO 
REMINDED US, THE WORLD, THAT 
HIS NUCLEAR BUTTON WAS MUCH 
BIGGER THAN CHAIRMAN KIM'S 
NUCLEAR BUTTON, AND HERE WE ARE 
NOW, THIS HISTORIC MOMENT, 
BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES AND THE DICTATOR 
OF NORTH KOREA, KIM JONG-UN, 
AFTER HAVING A MEETING, WHICH 
THE PRESIDENT IN HIS OWN WORDS 
SAID WAS FANTASTIC, IT WENT 
GREAT, HERE WE ARE, WITNESSING 
A MOMENT IN HISTORY, WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT INDICATED TO 
REPORTERS THAT THEY WERE ON 
THEIR WAY TO SOME KIND OF 
SIGNING, AND NOW, CAMERAS HAVE 
BEEN SET UP, FLAGS OF BEEN 
PLACED, CHAIRMAN KIM'S PEN HAS 
BEEN CLEANED, A REALLY SURREAL 
MOMENT FOR THOSE OF US WATCHING 
THIS. 
IF YOU MISSED IT, ONE OF THE 
HANDLERS WENT TO THE SEAT THAT 
PRESUMABLY CHAIRMAN KIM WILL BE 
SITTING IN, PUT ON A PLAYER OF 
WHITE GLOVES, AND PICKED UP THE 
PEN, AND DID WHATEVER HE DID, 
HE CLEANED IT, AND WHO KNOWS 
WHAT, MADE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT 
FAULTY, AND PLACED IT BACK ON 
THAT MATT, AND NOW WE ARE JUST 
WAITING FOR THE TWO LEADERS TO 
EMERGE, WE GUESS, FROM THOSE 
DOUBLE DOORS.
>> WAITING FOR THE NEWS TO 
HAPPEN. 
ONE KIND OF IMAGINES HOW LONG 
THIS WILL GO ON, WERE HOW LONG 
THIS COULD GO ON BEFORE PEOPLE 
STARTED LEAVING, ONE HOUR, TWO 
HOURS, THREE HOURS, WE JUST 
CONTINUE TO WAIT HERE, BUT WE 
WOULD, BECAUSE WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. 
>> IF THIS WAS UNSCRIPTED, IT 
HAD NOT BEEN HAMMERED OUT IN 
DETAIL, THAT'S WHY THESE THINGS 
ARE TIGHTLY CHOREOGRAPHED, AND 
THAT'S WHY WE HAD AN EXACT 
SCHEDULE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE 
ITSELF, THE OFFICE OF THE PRESS 
SECRETARY, WITH THE GUIDANCE, 
THE PRESS SCHEDULE, WHAT TIME 
AND IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- IT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> AT THE G7, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WAS LATE, THAT DERAILED 
MEETINGS THAT WERE SAID TO 
HAPPEN, THIS IS FOLLOW THE 
SCHEDULE THAT THE WHITE HOUSE 
PUT OUT TO A T.>> THERE'S A 
MOVEMENT AT THE DOOR, WHICH IS 
SEE WHAT IT IS BEFORE WE GO TO 
A COMMERCIAL BREAK. 
REMARKABLE.
>>> ALL RIGHT, AS YOU POINT 
OUT, WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THIS 
COULD GO ON FOR, SO WHY DON'T WE
-- HOPING IT DOESN'T HAPPEN 
WHILE WE ARE IN A COMMERCIAL 
BREAK, LET'S TAKE A QUICK 
COMMERCIAL BREAK, AS WE KEEP 
OUR EYES TRAINED ON THOSE 
DOUBLE DOORS, A POSSIBLE 
SIGNING THAT WILL TAKE PLACE 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 
JONG-UN, A QUICK BREAK, WE'LL 
BE RIGHT BACK. 
>>>  WELCOME BACK TO CBS NEWS,  
CBSN'S SPECIAL COVERAGE OF THE 
HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP  AND NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN, THE 
MEETING FOR THE MOST PART GOING 
BY THE LETTER, BY THE HOUR, AS 
RELEASED BY THE HOUSE -- THE 
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY, WE 
HAD A SCHEDULE OF EVENTS, AND 
THEN AT A MOMENT, THE PRESIDENT 
AND KIM JONG-UN EXITED THE úWOR 
WALKED OVER TO REPORTERS AND 
CAMERAS, AND SUGGESTED THAT 
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING GREAT, 
FANTASTIC MEANING, LOTS OF 
PROGRESS, TOP-OF-THE-LINE, AND 
THEN AT ONE POINT HE SAID WE 
ARE ON OUR WAY TO A SIGNING, 
AND EVERYONE LOOKED AROUND AND 
SAID WHAT IS THAT? 
AND WE HAVE CAMERAS TRAINED ON 
THE DOUBLE DOORS AT THE CAPELA 
HOTEL, THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND 
OF SIGNING, WHAT IS BEING SIGN, 
WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA, WE 
HAVE TALKED TO HER REPORTERS, 
AND ZEKE MILLER IS THERE, THEY 
HAVE INDICATED TO US THAT THEY 
ARE SCRATCHNG THEIR HEADS, 
MUCH THE SAME WAY WE ARE, 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS 
GOING TO BE SIGN, AND WE EXPECT 
THAT THE PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN 
KIM WILL EMERGE FROM THOSE 
DOUBLE DOORS, WHAT IS GOING TO 
SIT -- TO BE SIGNED, WE DON'T 
KNOW, WHAT WAS NEXT ON THE 
AGENDA WAS THE PRESIDENT MAKING 
COMMENTS TO THE PRESS ABOUT 4 
PM LOCAL TIME, BUT RIGHT NOW, 
WE ARE WAITING TO SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
MOMENTS HERE. 
WHEN THOSE DOORS OPEN UP IN 
THOSE TWO LEADERS WALK OUT. 
I'M HERE WITH GABE, AND ISAAC 
STONE FISH, WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR THE LAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS.  
A REMARKABLE MOMENT. 
>> IT IS AN UNEXPECTED MOMENT, 
AND IT WILL DICTATE HOW THIS 
RELATIONSHIP MOVES FORWARD. 
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER, BOTH 
PARTIES ARE IN THIS WEIRD 
SITUATION, THEY ARE TRYING TO 
DECIDE HOW MUCH THEY WANT TO 
PUSH EACH OTHER, AND THIS IDEA, 
IF THEY PUSH TOO MUCH, IT COULD 
ALSO RUN THE RISK OF NOT BEING 
ABLE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT, 
BUT ALSO A CRUCIAL MOMENT, WHAT 
IF THEY DON'T PUSH ENOUGH? 
BEHIND THOSE DOUBLE DOORS, 
WHERE ALL THE ACTION IS 
HAPPENING, SOME SORT OF 
NEGOTIATION, WHAT EXACTLY IS 
GOING TO BE SIGNED, WILL BE ON 
THAT, WHATEVER THAT DECLARATION 
IS.
>> THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL. 
MANY TIMES AFTER MEETINGS 
BETWEEN TWO WORLD LEADERS, THE 
SIGN CURRENT -- SOME KIND OF A 
DOCUMENT, AND THEN DIPLOMACY 
COMES AFTERWARDS, AND 
UNDERLINGS ENGAGE IN THE HARD 
BUSINESS OF DIPLOMACY, BUT IT 
DOES SEEM THAT THERE WAS SOME 
KIND OF MOMENT HERE WHERE IT 
FELT UNSCRIPTED, IT FELT VERY 
ORGANIC, BECAUSE IT IS NOT -- 
WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A HALF 
HOUR OR SO, THE FACT THAT IT 
HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE YET, WHERE 
EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN BY THE 
MINUTE, IT IS UNUSUAL. 
>> ALL OF THESE EXPECTATIONS 
OVER HOW LEADERS ARE SUPPOSED 
TO BEHAVE, AND TRUMP CERTAINLY 
DOESN'T FOLLOW A LOT OF THOSE, 
AND KIM JONG-UN DOESN'T FOLLOW 
A LOT OF THOSE, WE DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HIS EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR 
THIS, BUT THE WAY THAT DIPLOMACY
, THE WAY THAT SUMMITS ARE 
USUALLY PRACTICE, CERTAINLY 
DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE WAY 
THIS IS UNFOLDING.
>> LET'S GO TO CBS NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT STEPHEN PORTNOY, 
HE HAS BEEN WITNESSING WHAT WE 
HAVE BEEN WITNESSING ON CAMERA, 
JUST TALK US THROUGH THE 
REMARKABLE MOMENT WITH THE 
PRESIDENT CAME OUT TO THE PRESS 
POOL AND MADE COMMENTS ABOUT 
ASSIGNING?>> PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WALKED DOWN THE PATH WITH KIM 
JONG-UN BY HIS SIDE, AND THEY 
FACED REPORTERS, AND THE 
PRESIDENT SAID THAT THE MEETING 
IS GOING BETTER THAN ANYONE 
COULD HAVE EXPECTED, TOP-OF-THE-
LINE, A REALLY GOOD. 
AND THEN HE SAID THAT HE AND 
THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR WOULD 
BE SIGNING SOMETHING SHORTLY, 
BUT HE DID NOT SAY WHAT, HE HAS 
BEEN TAKEN -- THEY HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN TO A ROOM, 2 CHAIRS, AND 
PENS AT BOTH CHAIRS, WITH NORTH 
KOREAN AND AMERICAN FLAGS, IN A 
FEW MOMENTS, WE EXPECT THEY 
WILL EMERGE FROM THE 
BACKGROUND, TAKE THEIR SEATS, 
AND SIGN SOMETHING.>> I HAVE 
BEEN POINTING OUT TO VIEWERS, 
THIS HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN 
HAS BEEN SCHEDULED BY THE 
MINUTE, THE WHITE HOUSE 
RELEASED A DAILY GUIDE IN PRESS 
SCHEDULE, AND FOR THE MOST PART,
EVERYTHING THEY SKI -- SIGNAL 
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HAPPEN BY 
THE MINUTE, BUT THIS WAS NOT ON 
THE AGENDA. 
>> THIS WAS NOT AN EXPECTED 
EVENT, BUT THE WAY THIS HAS 
BEEN ORCHESTRATED, THERE WAS 
SOME DEGREE OF PLANNING TO 
STAGE IT, THERE ARE LIGHTS, AND 
WE PRESUME MICROPHONES, 
POSITIONING THE FLAGS OF 
COURSE, AND REPORTERS HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT IN CERTAINLY SOMEBODY 
HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING 
TO HAPPEN, BUT WE WERE INCLUDED 
ON IT. 
WE HAVE SEEN AT LEAST THREE 
SEPARATE, OR MAYBE FOUR, IF YOU 
INCLUDE THE LUNCH, WHERE THEY 
HAVE BEEN SEEN TOGETHER ON 
CAMERA, THERE WAS THE INITIAL 
MEETING WHERE THEY BOTH WALKED 
OUT AND SHOOK -- SHOULD EACH OF 
HIS HANDS, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK 
KIM ASIDE, AND THE SCENE WAS SO 
SURREAL, THEY THOUGHT IT WAS 
OUT OF A SCI-FI MOVIE, IS WHAT 
KIM SAID, AND THEN THEY WERE IN 
A PRIVATE MEETING WITH ONLY 
INTERPRETERS, AND THEY SAID TO 
ONE ANOTHER, THAT THEY WOULD 
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION, THE 
PRESIDENT TRUSTED THAT IT WOULD 
BE SUCCESSFUL, THEN THE AIDS 
WERE BROUGHT IN, AND THE 
PRESIDENT SAID THAT A DEAL IS 
GOING TO GET DONE. 
HE OBVIOUSLY DID NOT SAY WHAT. 
THEN WE SAW THE BEEN HAVING A 
WORKING LUNCH, OF SHORT RIB, 
AND SWEETS ARE POOR, AND THEN, 
THEY WALKED TOWARDS THE PRESS, 
AND THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED 
THAT THIS DOCUMENT WOULD BE 
SIGNED, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
, THAT THE TWO MEN ARE GOING TO 
AGREE TO. 
ONE HISTORICAL NOTE. 
IT WAS JUNE 11, 1993, THAT KIM 
JONG-UN'S GRANDFATHER SIGNED OR 
DIRECTED THE SIGNING, OF WHAT 
WAS THEN KNOWN AS THE AGREED 
FRAMEWORK, SOMETHING THAT TOOK 
PLACE EARLY IN THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION, IN WHICH NORTH 
KOREA AGREED TO THE PRINCIPLE 
OF A NUCLEAR FREE PENINSULA, 
WHAT WE LATER LEARNED WAS THAT 
THEY SECRETLY DEVELOP A -- 
DEVELOPED A NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
PROGRAM, AND NOW WE KNOW BASED 
ON THE REPORTING OF DAVID MARTY 
-- DAVID MARTIN AT THE 
PENTAGON, NORTH KOREA HAS THE 
CAPABILITY TO FIRE A BALLISTIC 
MISSILE THAT COULD REACH THE 
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES, AND 
THE CONCERN HAS BEEN THAT THEY 
HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO PUT A 
NUCLEAR WARHEAD ON THAT MISSILE.
WE HAVE HEARD, THAT AT ANY 
MOMENT, WE WILL SEE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WITH KIM JONG-UN, AND THE 
PRESIDENT IS SCHEDULED TO HAVE 
A NEWS CONFERENCE IN SINGAPORE 
IN ABOUT 2.5 HOURS, WE HAVE 
HEARD HIM SAY IT HAS BEEN A 
GOOD MEETING, BETTER THAN 
ANYONE COULD HAVE EXPECTED, 
AIDES ARE NOW PLACING SOME SORT 
OF DOCUMENT ON THE TABLE, FOR 
EACH OF THE LEADERS TO SIGN, WE 
STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT IS INSIDE 
THOSE BINDERS.>> IT IS A 
REMARKABLE TURN OF EVENTS, AND 
WE KNOW OVER THE WEEKEND, THE 
PRESIDENT SUGGESTED TO THE 
WORLD, AND TO THE PRESS CORPS, 
THAT WITHIN A MINUTE, HE WOULD 
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT MR. KIM'S 
INTENTIONS WERE SOLID, WHETHER 
OR NOT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO 
AGREE TO SOME OF THE THINGS 
THAT THE UNITED STATES WAS 
LOOKING FOR, AND GIVEN WHAT WE 
HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST FOUR OR 
FIVE HOURS, THE WAY THAT THEY 
HAVE ENGAGED WITH EACH OTHER, 
AND THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
SORT OF TALKING TO -- EVEN WHEN 
THEY APPROACHED CAMERAS, BRIEF 
ASIDES TO THE PRESS, JUST BEING 
THERE AND WITNESSING THAT, WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE OF IT? 
>> THE BODY LANGUAGE WAS 
STRIKING, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CHARACTERISTICALLY HAS BEEN 
ACTING AS THE MASTER OF 
CEREMONIES, TAPPING KIM JONG-UN 
ON THE SHOULDER, DIRECTING HIM 
INTO A ROOM, AT ONE POINT HE 
WAS JOKING WITH THE 
PHOTOGRAPHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU MAKE HIM LOOK NICE AND 
PRETTY AND THIN, KIM JONG-UN 
HAS BEEN RATHER JOVIAL IN HIS 
APPEARANCE, HE HAS SMILED 
BROADLY, AND SEEMED TO CHUCKLE, 
BUT AT OTHER POINTS HE HAS 
SEEMED STOIC AND WORN A BLANK 
EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE. 
HE IS DRESSED IN A BLACK TUNIC, 
REMINISCENT OF THE KIND OF 
DRESS THAT CHAIRMAN MAO WOULD 
WEAR, PRESIDENT TRUMP IN A 
TRADITIONAL BUSINESS SUIT, VERY 
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE KIND OF 
ATTIRE HE WEARS, WITH A CLASSIC 
RED TIE THAT HE LIKES TO WEAR.>>
THE OTHER THING THAT IS 
FASCINATING, AS YOU HAVE 
COVERED THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE 
G-7 SUMMIT, THE TENSION THAT 
EXISTS NOW BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND SOME OF OUR 
STRONGEST AND OLDEST ALLIES, 
INCLUDING FRANCE AND CANADA, 
THE PRESIDENT SUGGESTING THAT 
RUSSIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED BACK 
INTO THE G-7, AND THEN MAKING 
SOME DEROGATORY COMMENTS ABOUT 
THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA, 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, ECHOED BY ONE 
OF HIS ADVISORS ON TELEVISION, 
CONTRAST THAT WITH THE WAY THAT 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEHAVED WITH 
CHAIRMAN KIM OF THE LAST COUPLE 
OF HOURS? 
>> THE TENSION WITH THE G-7 
ALLIES HAS TO SOME DEGREE BEEN 
OVERSHADOWING THE LEAD UP TO 
THE SUMMIT, ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT WAS ASKED TO SECRETARY OF 
STATE MIKE POMPEO WAS HOW THE 
NORTH KOREANS COULD TRUST THE 
COMMITMENT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
MIGHT MAKE TO THEM IF HE WAS 
WILLING TO INITIALLY SIGN ON TO 
THE G-7 COMMUNIQUC BUT THEN 
ONCE HE HEARD ABOUT WHAT JUSTIN 
TRUDEAU SAID ABOUT HIM AT A 
PRESS CONFERENCE, UNIQUE TO THE 
U.S. OUT OF THAT COMMUNIQUC 
SECRETARY MIKE POMPEO DID NOT 
DIRECTLY ANSWER THAT, BUT IT 
CERTAINLY STILL LINGERS. 
>> THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE 
HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING WITH OUR 
PANEL AND A TRIO OF ANALYST, 
JOINING US THROUGHOUT THE 
COVERAGE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT 
THE PRESIDENT INSTRUCTED HIS 
REPRESENTATIVES NOT TO SIGN THE 
COMMUNIQUC AND CERTAINLY THE 
PRESIDENT MIGHT HAVE HIS 
REASONS, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE 
NORTH KOREANS HAVE ZERO 
CREDIBILITY ON THE WORLD STAGE 
WHEN IT COMES TO NEGOTIATIONS 
LIKE THIS, WHICH FACE IT, THEY 
HAVE DONE IN THE PAST, NOT AT 
THIS LEVEL, THERE IS NEVER BEEN 
A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT TO 
MEET A NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR, 
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER 
READINGS BETWEEN HIGH-RANKING 
OFFICIALS OF THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT, AND ALMOST EVERY 
SINGLE TIME AS YOU KNOW, NORTH 
KOREANS HAVE BACKTRACKED, SO 
LET'S JUST WATCH FOR THE 
MOMENT, AS WE START TO SEE SOME 
OF THE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION 
COMING IN, THERE IS THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO, 
ALONG WITH THE CHIEF OF STAFF 
JOHN KELLY, AND THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR, JUMBLED, I 
THINK THAT IS SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS, WE EXPECT IF YOU ARE 
IN THAT ROOM WITNESSING THIS, 
WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES TO EMERGE FROM 
THOSE DOUBLE DOORS.>> THIS IS 
THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF 
HISTORIC MOMENTS, IT PLAYED OUT 
THROUGH THIS TUESDAY, EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING, IN THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES, BUT IT IS NOW 
EARLY AFTERNOON HERE, AND IT 
LOOKS LIKE SECRETARY OF STATE 
MIKE POMPEO IS WAITING TO 
DIRECT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 
JONG-UN TO THEIR SEATS, AS THEY 
SIGN SOME SORT OF JOINT 
STATEMENT OR DECLARATION, WE 
STILL DON'T KNOW WHAT, BUT IT 
IS MEANT TO BE A DOCUMENT FOR 
THE HISTORY -- FOR HISTORY, AND 
THE WORLD, ABOUT WHAT 
TRANSPIRED AT THIS HISTORIC 
SUMMIT. 
>> AND HERE IT IS, LET'S WATCH. 
>>> SO WE ARE SIGNING A PRETTY 
MPORTANT DOCUMENT, A PRETTY 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, AND WE 
HAVE HAD A REALLY GREAT TERM 
TOGETHER, A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, 
I WILL BE GIVING A NEWS 
CONFERENCE AT 2:30 PM, A LITTLE 
BIT LESS THAN TWO HOURS, WE 
WILL DISCUSS THIS AT GREAT 
LENGTH, I BELIEVE THEY WILL BE 
HANDING IT OUT ON BEHALF OF 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND MYSELF, AND WE 
ARE BOTH VERY HONORED TO SIGN 
THE DOCUMENT, THANK YOU.
>>  
>>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY 
SOMETHING TO THE PRESS?>> [ 
KOREAN LANGUAGE SPOKEN ]
>> TODAY, WE HAD A HISTORIC 
MEETING, AND WE DECIDED TO 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND, AND WE 
ARE GOING TO SIGN A HISTORIC 
DOCUMENT. 
THE WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR 
CHANGE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY 
GRATITUDE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 
MAKE THIS MEETING HAPPEN. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
OKAY. 
>> WE ARE STARTING THE PROCESS 
VERY QUICKLY, ABSOLUTELY. 
>> YOU WILL BE SEEING 
EVERYTHING IN JUST A LITTLE 
WHILE, THE LETTER THAT WE ARE 
SIGNING IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE, 
AND I THINK BOTH SIDES WILL BE 
VERY IMPRESSED BY THE RESULTS, 
A LOT OF GOODWILL WENT INTO 
THIS, A LOT OF WORK, A LOT OF 
ú 
THINK OF A LOT OF PEOPLE ON 
BOTH SIDES, SECRETARY MIKE 
POMPEO AND HIS COUNTERPARTS, 
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY 
FANTASTIC.>> [ KOREAN LANGUAGE 
SPOKEN ] 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, IT'S 
FANTASTIC.
>>  
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
EVERYBODY, WE WILL SEE YOU A 
LITTLE BIT LATER, WE ARE VERY 
PROUD OF WHAT TOOK PLACE TODAY, 
I THINK OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA IS GOING TO BE A VERY 
MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN 
IT HAS IN THE PAST. 
WE BOTH WANT TO DO SOMETHING, 
WE BOTH ARE GOING TO DO 
SOMETHING, AND WE HAVE 
DEVELOPED A VERY SPECIAL BOND, 
SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY 
IMPRESSED, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
BE VERY HAPPY, AND WE ARE GOING 
TO TAKE CARE OF A VERY BIG AND 
DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR THE 
WORLD, AND I WANT TO THINK 
CHAIRMAN KIM, WE SPENT A LOT OF 
TIME TOGETHER, INTENSIVE TIME, 
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT 
IT WORKED OUT FOR BOTH OF US 
FAR BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD 
HAVE EXPECTED, I THINK FAR 
BETTER, THE VARIOUS NEWS 
REPORTS, FAR BETTER THAN ANYONE 
PREDICTED, AND THIS IS GOING TO 
LEAD TO MORE AND MORE, AND IT 
IS AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU, A 
GREAT HONOR TO BE WITH YOU, 
THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOUR 
REPRESENTATIVES VERY MUCH.>> [ 
KOREAN LANGUAGE SPOKEN ] 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
EVERYBODY.
>> 
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
>>  
>>> ALL RIGHT, WHAT A HISTORIC 
MOMENT WE HAVE WITNESSED HERE, 
WE ARE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT 
YOU WAS JUST SIGNED, -- WHAT 
WAS JUST SIGN, A REMARKABLE 
MOMENT, BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM 
JONG-UN, THEY SAID THEY WILL 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND, THE 
WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR CHANGE, 
HE THINKS PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IT WAS A 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, THEY 
HAD A VERY INTENSIVE MEETING, 
THE PRESIDENT SAYING, FAR 
BETTER THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE 
PREDICTED, HE SAID TO KIM JONG-
UN THAT IT IS AN HONOR TO BE 
WITH YOU. 
THE PRESIDENT AFTERWARDS, AFTER 
HE SIGNED THOSE DOCUMENTS, A 
BIG SMILE ON THE PRESIDENTS 
FACE. 
I'M HERE -- THE PRESIDENT'S 
FACE. 
GABE LIPTON AND ISAAC STONE 
FISH. 
>> A BIG CONTRAST, THE BIGGEST 
SHOW OF ENTHUSIASM FROM KIM 
THAT WE SAW ALL NIGHT, A MOMENT 
THAT HE SORT OF SMILED IN WHAT 
SEEMED LIKE A GENUINE 
EXPRESSION OF EXCITEMENT, AND 
ENTHUSIASM, BUT AT THE SAME 
TIME, SEEMED A BIT READY TO GET 
OUT OF THE ROOM, LOOKING AT HIS 
ADVISORS AT TIMES, AND A BIT 
UNEASY. 
AGAIN, AS YOU MENTIONED, IT 
REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT THIS 
DOCUMENT ACTUALLY ENTAILS, THE 
DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS, BUT 
FROM THE BODY LANGUAGE, THIS 
COULD BE SOMETHING PRETTY 
IMPORTANT.>> THIS IS A 
MASSIVELY IMPORTANT MOMENT. 
TRUMP LEADING UP TO THIS HAD 
REALLY TRIED TO MANAGE 
EXPECTATIONS, WITH THE SIGNING, 
HE THREW THAT OUT THE WINDOW. 
HE IS REALLY EXPLAINING HOW 
IMPORTANT THIS IS, WE DON'T 
KNOW WHAT IT IS YET, WE HAD KIM 
JONG-UN SAYING THAT THEY ARE 
LEAVING THE PAST BEHIND, 
LEAVING HISTORY BEHIND US, 
EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS ENTAILING, 
THEY SAID THEY WILL AND THOSE 
DOCUMENTS OUT, AND FASCINATED 
TO SEE WHAT THOSE ARE. 
>> WE ALL ARE, A SPECIAL MOMENT 
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP, SOMETHING 
THAT HE HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
FOR QUITE SOME TIME, HE DID 
BELIEVE THAT THE CAMPAIGN OF 
MAXIMUM PRESSURE THAT HE PUT ON 
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME IS 
DIRECTLY WHAT LED TO THIS 
MOMENT, WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
CALLED A HISTORIC MOMENT, THIS 
IS SOMETHING WE HAVE NEVER SEEN 
BEFORE, IT NORTH KOREAN LEADER 
SITTING DOWN WITH A SITTING 
U.S. PRESIDENT TO HAMMER OUT 
SOME DETAILS, AND GETTING TO 
THIS POINT, WHERE YOU SEE THE 
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES 
SIGNING A DOCUMENT, SIDE-BY-
SIDE, WITH THE DICTATOR OF 
NORTH KOREA, THIS IS BY ALL 
EXTENTS, THE PRESIDENT SAID IT 
WAS SOMETHING HE WANTED TO DO, 
AND HERE HE IS DOING IT. 
>> THERE WAS A MOMENT WHERE YOU 
COULD HEAR A REPORTER ASKED, 
HAVE YOU AGREED TO 100% 
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND HE WAS 
PRESIDENT, TOTAL SILENCE. 
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHAT IS 
IN THE DOCUMENT, THAT WILL BE 
CRUCIAL. 
BUT VERY STRIKING, LOOKING AT 
THIS ROOM, THE POSITIONS, IS 
NORTH KOREA READY TO GIVE UP ITS
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, UNDER WHAT 
TERMS? 
A AMAZING MOMENT. 
>> CHAIRMAN KIM SAID THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE LEAVING THE PAST 
BEHIND, YOU CAN INTERPRET THAT 
IN MANY WAYS, DOES IT MEAN A 
CESSATION OF THE KOREAN WAR, 
WHICH HAS NEVER ENDED, THAT 
COULD BE ONE THING, IT COULD 
MEAN GIVING UP THEIR NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, THAT IS ANOTHER, SO 
MANY POSSIBILITIES, WE SIMPLY 
DON'T KNOW, I KEEP LOOKING AT 
MY EMAIL, LOOKING DOWN, HE SAID 
HE WILL MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO 
THE PRESS, AND AS SOON AS WE 
KNOW, WE WILL SHARE WITH OUR 
VIEWERS, BUT I'M INTRIGUED 
ABOUT WHAT THIS COULD POSSIBLY 
BE. 
THIS PRESIDENT CAMPAIGNED ON 
BEING A CHANGE AGENT, DISRUPTOR,
AND HOWEVER YOU WANT TO CUT 
THIS, NO MATTER WHAT KIND OF -- 
WHAT SIDE OF THE POLITICAL 
AISLE YOU'RE ON, THIS IS WHAT 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.>> IF IT 
IS SOMETHING SYMBOLIC LIKE THE 
END TO THE KOREAN WAR, OR 
TALKING ABOUT A NEW FRIENDSHIP 
BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS, THAT 
WILL BE A LOT MORE -- 
┗> THESE A 
WE'RE LOOKING AT, AGAIN, THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND CHAIRMAN KIM.
>> A GREAT PERSONALITY, VERY 
SMART, A WORTHY NEGOTIATOR. 
ON BEHALF OF HIS PEOPLE, HE IS 
A VERY WORTHY AND SMART 
NEGOTIATOR. 
WE HAD A TERRIFIC DAY. 
WE LEARN MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER 
AND ABOUT OUR COUNTRIES.
>> WHAT DID YOU LEARN ABOUT HIM?
>> I LEARNED THAT HE IS A VERY 
TALENTED MAN. 
THAT HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY VERY 
MUCH.
>> WHEN WILL YOU SEE EACH OTHER 
AGAIN? 
>> WILL YOU BE MEETING AGAIN? 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
EVERYBODY.
>>> THERE YOU HAVE IT, YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT HISTORY IN THE 
MAKING, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
NORTH KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-
UN, AFTER SIGNING WHAT HAS BEEN 
CALLED A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, THE 
TWO LEADERS SHAKING HANDS ONCE 
AGAIN, AND YOU CAN SEE AS THE 
CAMERAS WERE ROLLING, THEY WERE 
HAVING WORDS WITHOUT EACH OTHER 
-- WORDS WITH EACH OTHER, 
WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF 
TRANSLATORS, IT HAS BEEN SAID 
THAT KIM JONG-UN DOES SPEAK 
ENGLISH OR AT LEAST UNDERSTANDS 
ENGLISH, AND HE SPEAKS GERMAN, 
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE EXPECTS 
THEY WILL MEET AGAIN MANY TIMES 
IN THE FUTURE, HE IS A TALENTED 
MAN, HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY VERY 
MUCH, AND HE CALLED HIM A 
WORTHY NEGOTIATOR. 
THERE IS A LOT TO ABSORB HERE. 
MOMENTS EARLIER, SITTING DOWN 
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM, DOCUMENTS 
PLACED IN FRONT OF THEM, BOTH 
OF THOSE LEADERS SIGNING THOSE 
DOCUMENTS, WE ARE GET TO KNOW 
WHAT THEY ARE. 
WHAT THEY POSSIBLY COULD BE, 
I'M CHECKING THOSE EMAILS, WE 
STILL DON'T HAVE THEM YET, THIS 
IS JUST A REMARKABLE MOMENT, AND
CALLING ATTENTION TO THE 
PRESENCE TWEET, FROM A FEW HOURS
AGO TODAY, THE FACT THAT I AM 
HAVING A MEETING IS A BIG LOSS 
FOR THE U.S., SAY THE HATERS 
AND LOSERS, WE HAVE HOSTAGES, 
TESTING AND MISSILE LAUNCHES 
HAVE STOPPED, AND THESE PUNDITS 
HAVE NOTHING ELSE THEY CAN SAY, 
WE WILL BE FINE. 
JUST GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS, 
THE PRESIDENT IS PROVING
HIMSELF TO BE AT LEAST RIGHT 
THIS MOMENT. 
>> THAT IS PROBABLY TAKING IT A 
BRIDGE TOO FAR, WE HAVE 
ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF THAT NORTH 
KOREA HAS STOPPED ANY SORT OF 
NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES, THE FACT 
THAT THEY HAVE NOT LAUNCHED A 
MISSILE WERE DONE ANOTHER 
NUCLEAR TEST DOES NOT MEAN THAT 
THEY WILL DO THAT IN THE NEXT 
SEVERAL MONTHS, AND REALLY THE 
IMPORTANCE HERE, IS IF THEY CAN 
SIGN AN AGREEMENT THAT HELPS TO 
BUILD BETTER RELATIONS, THAT'S 
GREAT, BUT AS WE DISCUSSED 
BEFORE, IT IS EASY FOR NORTH 
KOREA TO BACK OUT OF THIS 
RELATIONSHIP.>> AND THEY'VE 
DONE THAT MANY TIMES THE PAST, 
IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF THEY 
DIDN'T, AND IF THE AGREEMENT IS 
ABLE TO BIND THEM IN A WAY THAT 
IS BETTER FOR THE INTERESTS OF 
BOTH COUNTRIES, BUT I THINK 
THAT TRUMPS TWEET WAS CERTAINLY 
PREMATURE. 
>> IN THE LAST STATEMENT THAT 
WE JUST SAW, THE PRESIDENT 
CALLED MR. KIM A WORTHY 
NEGOTIATOR, SMART, A TALENTED 
MAN WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY, THE 
PRESIDENT IS STAKING HIS CLAIM 
TO WANT TO BUILD THIS 
RELATIONSHIP, HE SAID THEY WILL 
MEET MANY TIMES, JUST THE FIRST 
OF MANY DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE 
TWO LEADERS, AND WE WILL HAVE 
TO SEE WHAT THESE DEFINITIONS 
MEAN. 
AND KIM HIMSELF MENTIONED A 
CHANGE IN THE HISTORIC 
RELATIONSHIP, WHAT DOES THAT 
MEAN? 
DOES THAT MEAN A CHANGE FROM 
THE U.S. SIDE OF THE KOREAN 
SIDE? 
A NEW AND MORE PROSPEROUS, OPEN 
NORTH KOREA? 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING 
TO TAKE TIME TO UNWIND, BUT THE 
FACT THAT THEY MET, THEY SIGNED 
AN AGREEMENT, AS THE VIEWERS 
ARE SEEING, IT IS A HISTORIC 
THING. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS 
GOING TO BE HOLDING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE AND JUST ABOUT 40 
MINUTES OR SO, WHICH IS MOVED 
P EARLIER FROM WHAT WE THOUGHT 
IT WAS GOING TO BE, WE THOUGHT 
IT WAS GOING TO BE 4 PM LOCAL 
TIME, 4 AM EASTERN TIME, THE 
PRESIDENT SAID IT WILL HAPPEN 
ABOUT 2:30 PM. 
TO YOUR POINT, THIS LOOKS 
GREAT, AND FOR ALL WE KNOW, 
WHATEVER WAS SIGNED, IS IN FACT 
A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, THE 
QUESTION WILL BE, WHAT THE 
NORTH KOREANS HAVE AGREED TO, 
WHAT KIND OF VERIFICATION 
PROCESS WILL THEY AGREE TO, 
THAT IS TO BE FIGURED OUT, WE 
SIMPLY DON'T KNOW. 
AND SO THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT 
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HAVE 
TO ANSWER, AND STILL A CHANCE, 
THOSE QUESTIONS WILL COME FAST 
AND FURIOUS, PEOPLE WANT TO 
KNOW WHAT KIND OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION ARE WE TALKING 
ABOUT, THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
CONDITIONS, THE PRESIDENT SAID 
EARLIER THAT HE WOULD DO THAT. 
WE ARE ON PINS AND NEEDLES 
HERE, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 
THIS DOCUMENT IS, CERTAINLY THE 
DOCUMENT IS THERE, I THE 
PRESIDENT WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. 
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR QUESTION? 
>> MY QUESTION WOULD BE, WHAT 
ú 
SUBSTANTIVELY HAVE YOU AGREED 
TO DO WITH MR. KIM? 
THE FACT THAT THERE IS A 
DOCUMENT ISN'T NECESSARILY GOOD 
NEWS, IT COULD BE QUITE BAD 
NEWS, THERE ARE A FEW TRAPS 
THAT TRUMP COULD STEP INTO, 
AGREEING PREMATURELY TO REMOVE 
U.S. TROOPS FROM THE SOUTH 
KOREAN PENINSULA, OR WHETHER IT 
IS ECONOMIC RELIEF BEFORE NORTH 
KOREA HAS DONE ANYTHING, THERE 
ARE PLENTY OF TRIPWIRES FOR 
THIS U.S. PRESIDENT, WHO IS IN 
THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS, A 
FAIRLY INEXPERIENCED DIPLOMATIC 
NEGOTIATOR, RIGHT? 
AS THERE ARE TRIPWIRES FOR THE 
NORTH KOREAN LEADER. 
>> WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS WOULD 
YOU HAVE, ISAAC?>> I WOULD LOVE 
TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THE 
DOCUMENT, I'M SURE THAT WILL 
COME OUT PRETTY SOON, WHAT DO 
WE NEED TO SEE FOR NORTH KOREA 
IN THE FEW WEEKS, MONTHS, 
YEARS, IN ORDER FOR THIS TO 
HAPPEN? 
HOW IS CHINA GOING TO BE 
INVOLVED? 
AND I WOULD ONE TRUMP TO STAKE 
OUT A POSITION THAT HE HAS TO 
HOLD TWO, HOW MUCH CREDIT ARE 
YOU TAKING FOR SOLVING THIS, 
AND IN SIX MONTHS OR YEAR, IF 
THINGS HAVE GONE DIFFERENTLY, 
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT 
IT THEN?
>> REALLY FASCINATING, STILL 
WAITING TO HEAR WHAT EXACTLY 
WAS SIGNED IN THE DOCUMENT, 
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK, WHOLE 
LOT MORE ON THE SUMMIT, THE 
HISTORIC SUMMIT, WHEN WE COME 
BACK, YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.  
THIS IS CBSN. 
ALWAYS ON.  
>>> HI, EVERYONE, I AM VLADIMIR 
DUTHIERS, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
JOINING US,  IT IS ABOUT 2 PM 
IN SINGAPORE, WHERE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN MET FACE-
TO-FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THE 
HISTORIC SUMMIT UNFOLDED ABOUT 
FIVE HOURS AGO, WHEN THE. 
SHOOK HANDS AT THE CAPELLA 
HOTEL, ON SENTOSA ISLAND,  IN 
FRONT OF U.S. AND NORTH KOREAN 
FLAGS.>> I FEEL GREAT, WE ARE 
GOING TO HAVE A GREAT 
DISCUSSION, AND I THINK WE WILL 
BE TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. 
>> AT THAT MEETING, THE 
PRESIDENT WENT ON TO SAY THEY 
WILL HAVE A TERRIFIC 
RELATIONSHIP, KIM JONG-UN SAID 
IT WAS NOT EASY TO GET HERE, 
SINCE THEN, THEY HAVE HELD A 
ONE-ON-ONE MEETING, AND A 
WORKING LUNCH WITH TOP 
ADVISORS, THE PAIR WALKED 
OUTSIDE THE HOTEL, AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP BRIEFLY SPOKE 
TO REPORTERS. 
>> IT'S GOING GREAT, WE HAD A 
FANTASTIC MEETING, A LOT OF 
PROGRESS, REALLY VERY POSITIVE, 
BETTER THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE 
EXPECTED. 
TOP-OF-THE-LINE, REALLY GOOD. 
WE ARE GOING RIGHT NOW FOR 
SIGNING.>> THE PRESIDENT 
HINTING AT AN UNSCHEDULED 
SIGNING, AND AFTER 1:30 PM 
LOCAL TIME, WE HEARD WHAT HE 
WAS TALKING ABOUT. 
>> WE ARE SIGNING A VERY 
IMPORTANT DOCUMENT, PRETTY 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, AND WE 
HAVE HAD A REALLY GREAT TERM 
TOGETHER, A GREAT RELATIONSHIP, 
I WILL BE GIVING A NEWS 
CONFERENCE AT 2:30 PM, WHICH IS 
A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN TWO 
HOURS, AND WE WILL DISCUSS THIS 
AT GREAT LENGTH. 
IN THE MEANTIME, I BELIEVE THEY 
WILL BE HANDING OUT ON BEHALF 
OF CHAIRMAN KIM AND MYSELF, WE 
ARE BOTH VERY HONORED TO SIGN 
THE DOCUMENT. 
THANK YOU.>> BEN TRACY IS 
JOINING US FROM SINGAPORE, ONE 
OF THE FEW WESTERN JOURNALISTS 
TO HAVE TRAVEL TO NORTH KOREA. 
FIRST OF ALL, FIRST QUESTION, 
HAVE YOU RECEIVED WITH THAT 
DOCUMENT WAS? 
ARE YOU, THE PRESS CORPS, AWARE 
WHAT WAS SIGNED JUST NOW?
>> NO, FOR A PRESIDENT WHO WAS 
A REALITY TV STAR IN A FORMER 
LIFE, HE KNOWS HOW TO DELIVER A 
CLIFFHANGER, IT IS HARD TO 
REMEMBER A TIME WHEN A 
PRESIDENT WOULD SIT NEXT TO A 
ANOTHER -- NEXT TO ANOTHER 
FOREIGN HEAD OF STATE, AND NO 
ONE KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE SIGNING.
HE SAID THERE HANDING IT OUT AT 
THE NEWS CONFERENCE, IT WAS 
SCHEDULED FOR 4 PM, BUT HE SAID 
IT WAS 2:30 PM, BUT NO, THIS IS 
QUITE THE DRAMATIC ENDING TO 
THE SUMMIT THAT THEY HAVE 
AGREED TO SOMETHING, BUT NO ONE 
IS QUITE SURE WHAT IT IS. 
>> AND JUST TAKE US BACK 
THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF THE 
DAY, AS WE PLAY LIVE PICTURES 
RIGHT NOW OF KIM JONG-UN'S 
MOTORCADE DEPARTING THIS 
HISTORIC MEETING, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAYING ALL ALONG, OVER 
THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, THAT 
HIS RHETORIC HAS CHANGED FROM 
SAYING THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD 
BE MET WITH FIRE AND FURY, AND 
LITTLE ROCKET MAN DOESN'T HAVE 
A NUCLEAR BUTTON AS BIG AS HIS, 
WHERE THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING 
KIM JONG-UN IS A TALENTED MAN, 
GOOD NEGOTIATOR, LOVES HIS 
COUNTRY VERY MUCH, WE WILL MEET 
AGAIN. 
TAKE US THROUGH WHAT WE SAW 
UNFOLDING IN SINGAPORE OF THE 
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS?>> 
Reporter: THERE ARE A LOT OF 
BYGONES TO LET BE, IT APPEARS 
THAT BOTH MEN HAVE DONE THAT, 
THEY CAME TO THIS MEETING, THEY 
SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF AS MUCH AS 
YOU CAN TELL BY BODY LANGUAGE, 
THEN YOU SAW THESE 
EXTRAORDINARY MOMENTS WHERE 
THEY WERE WALKING TOGETHER IN 
THE COLONNADE, THERE WAS ONE 
VERY STRANGE MOMENT WHERE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ACTUALLY WALKED 
KIM JONG-UN OVER TO THE 
PRESIDENTIAL LIMO, AND SHOWED 
IT OFF, OPEN THE DOOR, AND SAID 
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF LOOK 
AT MY CAR, AND THEY WERE BOTH 
TALKING TO EACH OTHER, IN THE 
HALLWAY THERE, THE PRESIDENT 
SAID THEY WERE GOING TO SIGN 
SOMETHING, AND WE HAVE NOW HAD 
THIS SIGNING CEREMONY, A VERY 
UNIQUE DAY AS THESE THINGS GO, 
AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO 
SEE WHAT THIS DOCUMENT ACTUALLY 
SAYS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME TEASES OUT 
THERE SAYING, THIS IS A PRETTY 
COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT, THAT 
DENUCLEARIZATION WILL BE 
STARTING VERY QUICKLY, BUT 
THERE IS A LOT OF VAGUENESS IN 
THERE. 
IS THAT THE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
NORTH KOREA, MEANING THEY GIVE 
UP NORTH KOREA'S WEAPONS, OR 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA, WHICH 
WOULD ENTAIL THE UNITED STATES 
AGREED TO REMOVE TROOPS, OR NOT 
FLY NUCLEAR CAPABLE BOMBERS OF 
THE PENINSULA ANYMORE. 
SO THOSE TERMS CAN MEAN VERY 
DIFFERENT THINGS, WE WILL HAVE 
TO SEE WHAT KIND OF DETAIL IS 
IN THIS DOCUMENT, BUT IT DOES 
APPEAR THAT THEY ARE LEAVING 
THIS ON VERY GOOD TERMS, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE WOULD 
INVITE KIM JONG-UN TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND HE SAID OF COURSE HE 
WOULD, AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE 
RELATIONSHIP HAS CHANGED, AND 
KIM JONG-UN SAID THE WORLD WILL 
SEE SOMETHING NEW. 
>> NORTH KOREA AND THE UNITED 
STATES ARE GOING TO BE LEAVING 
THE PAST BEHIND THEY SAID, AND 
JUST FOR OUR VIEWERS WHO MAY 
NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH NORTH 
KOREA, OTHER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN 
REPORTED, IN OTHER WORDS THIS 
IS A COUNTRY YOU HAVE TRAVELED 
TO, AND THAT YOU KNOW, THIS IS 
A COUNTRY THAT HAS 
CONCENTRATION CAMPS WHERE THEY 
PUT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AND, 
CHAIRMAN KIM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE ASSASSINATION OF FAMILY 
MEMBERS, AND OTHERS WHO ARE IN 
THE GOVERNMENT, THAT HE HAS 
EITHER PURGED OR DISAGREED 
WITH, SO HE IS A BRUTAL 
DICTATOR. 
AND SOMETIMES OF COURSE THE 
UNITED STATES HAS TO GET CLOSE 
TO THE DICTATOR TO SEE WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT AND CHAIRMAN KIM 
CALLED MAJOR CHANGE, BUT FROM 
YOUR EXPERIENCE IN REPORTING 
NORTH KOREA, THIS IS A VERY 
BRUTAL REGIME. 
AMERICANS WOULD AGREE THAT IF 
YOU CAN SIT DOWN AND WORK OUT A 
DEAL THAT AVERTS A NUCLEAR WAR 
IT'S WORTH IT, BUT YOU ARE 
EXACTLY RIGHT, YOU CAN'T FORGET 
WHO WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE, 
THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT KIM 
JONG-UN BEING A NEW KIND OF 
LEADER, THE KINDS OF THINGS HE 
WAS TO DO, THAT'S ALL WELL AND 
GOOD, BUT EXACTLY WHAT YOU 
SAID, IT IS A BRUTAL 
DICTATORSHIP, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN KILLED, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 
STARVED, THIS WOULD NOT BE MUCH 
DIFFERENT IF YOU HAD SEEN THE 
FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH SITTING 
DOWN FOR LUNCH AT A SUMMIT WITH 
SADDAM HUSSEIN. 
IT IS ON THAT LEVEL. 
SO THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY 
THING TO WITNESS, THAT THIS 
HAPPENED TODAY, ESPECIALLY 
THESE TWO LEADERS, WHO HAD THIS 
PERSONAL ANIMOSITY, THIS WENT 
BEYOND TWO COUNTRIES 
DIFFERENCES OVER NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, THIS BECAME HIGHLY 
PERSONALIZED BETWEEN TWO 
LEADERS, AND PEOPLE WERE 
WORRIED ABOUT A 
MISINTERPRETATION THAT COULD 
START A FULL ON WAR. 
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY FROM 
THAT, TWO GUYS EATING HCGEN-
DAZS, THIS HAS COME A LONG WAY. 
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 
>> THAT RHETORIC YOU WERE 
TALKING ABOUT, THE PRESIDENT 
REPEATEDLY CALLED HIM LITTLE 
ROCKET MAN, AND KIM JONG-UN 
SAYING THAT THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES WAS A DOTARD, 
SENILE OR WEAK MINDED. 
AND NOW THE PRESIDENT OF UNITED 
STATES IS SAYING CHAIRMAN KIM 
IS A WORTHY NEGOTIATOR AND A 
TALENTED MAN. 
AND I WAS ALSO INTRIGUED BY 
REPORTERS, WESTERN REPORTERS 
SHOUTING QUESTIONS AT CHAIRMAN 
KIM, SOMETHING THAT HE HAS 
NEVER HAD TO DO WITH, A FREE 
AND DEMOCRATIC PRESS ABOUT WHAT 
HE IS DOING, FROM THE CAMERAS, 
THERE WAS A LOOK OF SURPRISE ON 
HIS FACE.>> Reporter: YES, IT 
IS AMAZING, THAT IS NOT 
SOMETHING HE WOULD EVER 
ENCOUNTER NORTH KOREA, NOT 
QUESTIONED BY JOURNALIST, BUT 
NOT QUETIONED BY ANYONE. 
SO I CERTAINLY THINK HE FOUND 
IT AMUSING TO SOME GREEK -- 
SOME DEGREE, HE DOES NOT ANSWER 
THE QUESTIONS, BUT STRIKING AS 
TO HOW WELL KIM JONG-UN HAS 
CARRIED ON IN THE SITUATIONS 
THAT ONE WOULD THINK ARE PRETTY 
BORING TO HIM, HE SEEMS TO TAKE 
IT ALL IN STRIDE. 
WHAT I WILL FIND INDUSTRY IS 
HOW THIS IS REPORTED -- WHAT I 
WILL FIND INTERESTING IS HOW 
THIS IS REPORTED NORTH KOREA, 
REORIENTING THEIR WHOLE 
OPERATION, PROPAGATION -- 
PROPAGANDA ABOUT THE UNITED 
STATES WANTING TO INVADE NORTH 
KOREA, KILLING ITS CITIZENS, 
THERE ARE PROPAGANDA POSTERS UP 
ALMOST EVERY CITY IN THE 
COUNTRY. 
THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO 
DEPROGRAM THE PROPAGANDA 
APPARATUS, AND CHANGE THIS IF 
THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE A 
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE 
RELATIONSHIP WITH UNITED STATES.
SO FAR, WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY 
REPORTING NORTH KOREA ABOUT THE 
OUTCOME OF THE SUMMIT, AND 
TYPICALLY THERE IS A BIT OF A 
LAG BEFORE THEY TELL THEIR 
PEOPLE SOMETHING, BUT THEY HAVE 
TOLD PEOPLE THAT HE IS HERE FOR 
THE SUMMIT, THEY EXPECT -- WE 
EXPECT THAT THEY WOULD REPORT 
ON THE SUMMIT, AND THE RESULT, 
AND WE HOPE THAT IT IS THE SAME 
REPORTING THAT WE SEE HERE IN 
SINGAPORE. 
>> THOSE IMAGES, WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, 
WITH THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER, 
SOMETHING THAT HAS NEVER 
HAPPENED, HE HAS ACHIEVES -- 
ACHIEVE SOMETHING THAT NEITHER 
HIS FATHER OR GRANDFATHER WERE 
ABLE TO ACHIEVE, IT IS AN 
ACCOMPLISHMENT, THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SIGNALED WOULD BE 
SOMETHING HE WANTED TO 
ACCOMPLISH, BUT FOR CHAIRMAN 
KIM AS WELL, HE HAS DONE 
SOMETHING THAT NORTH KOREA -- 
EIGHT NORTH KOREAN LEADER HAS 
NEVER DONE. 
AS YOU KNOW, THERE HAS BEEN TALK
THAT HE IS IN SOME WAYS VERY 
SIMILAR TO HIS GRANDFATHER, 
REPORTS OUT OF NORTH KOREA, 
THAT'S WHAT HE GAINED THE 
WEIGHT HE DID, HE CUTS HIS HAIR 
THE SAME WAY THAT HIS 
GRANDFATHER CUT HIS HAIR, AND 
SO BY ACHIEVING THIS LEVEL OF 
LEGITIMACY, WITH A U.S. 
PRESIDENT, THAT IS ONE WAY WE 
COULD SEE IT PLAYING OUT NORTH 
KOREA?>> Reporter: IT IS A BIG 
DEAL, THEY CAN USE THE 
PROPAGANDA OF THAT MOMENT, 
SHOWING HIM ON PAR WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES, TO 
KIND OF BURNISH HIS LEGACY AND 
NORTH KOREA. 
AND YOU ARE RIGHT, HE DOES TRY 
TO EMULATE HIS GRANDFATHER, WHO 
IS CONSIDERED GODLIKE AND NORTH 
KOREA, MUCH MORE POPULAR THAN 
KIM JONG-UN'S FATHER, WHO HAD 
THE UNFORTUNATE TASK OF 
PRESIDING OVER NORTH KOREA 
DURING THE WORST FAMINE, ONE OF 
THE WORST, IN HUMAN HISTORY, 
LARGELY SELF-INFLICTED. 
SO YES, KIM JONG-UN HAS TRIED 
TO APPEAR MORE LIKE HIS 
GRANDFATHER, BECAUSE PEOPLE 
THERE LIKE HIM. 
BUT HE HAS DONE SOMETHING THAT 
NO KIM HAS EVER DONE, BUT 
REMEMBER THE REASON HE GETS 
UNITED STATES, THE PRESIDENT, 
TO SIT DOWN WITH HIM, WAS NOT 
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO TALK TO 
NORTH KOREA, IT WAS BECAUSE 
NORTH KOREA WE BELIEVED HAD A 
NUCLEAR WEAPON OF -- THAT WAS 
CAPABLE OF HITTING UNITED 
STATES. 
IT WAS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES FELT HE úH 
THE UNITED STATES HAS WANTED TO 
DO HISTORICALLY, BECAUSE OF 
SOME OF THE LEGITIMACY THAT IT 
CONFERS AND THE LEADER OF NORTH 
KOREA.>> -- CONFERS ON THE 
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA.>>> YES, 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT, CHAIRMAN 
KIM, ACHIEVING THIS LEVEL OF 
NUCLEAR PROFICIENCY, BY ITS 
VERY NATURE, THE UNITED STATES 
HAS TRIED TO PREVENT THAT FOR 
THE LAST 30 OR 40 YEARS, KIM 
JONG-UN ACHIEVES IT, AND THAT 
WINS HIM A SEAT AT THE TABLE?
>> Reporter: AND THERE IS 
ALWAYS A CONCERN THAT WE LOOK 
AT THIS TOO MUCH THROUGH THE 
PRISM OF THE UNITED STATES, IN 
TERMS OF ACTIONS THE PRESIDENT 
HAS TAKEN OR THE UNITED STATES 
IS TAKEN. 
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE 
INTERNAL POLITICS OF NORTH 
KOREA, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT 
KIM JONG-UN DID NOT WANT TO 
HAVE THIS MEETING UNTIL HE 
REALLY FELT HE WAS COMING INTO 
IT IN A POSITION OF STRENGTH, 
AND LAUNCHING THAT FIRST 
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
MISSILE LAST YEAR, THAT BEGIN A 
PROCESS WHERE HE FINALLY HAD A 
HAND THAT WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO 
SIT DOWN AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
THIS SEEMS TO BE A PLAN, KIM 
JONG-UN SAID ARE NUCLEAR FORCE 
HAS BEEN BUILT, WE ARE PIVOTING 
TO THE ECONOMY, THAT IS WHAT WE 
ARE FOCUSING ON, HE REACHED OUT 
TO SOUTH KOREA, WE WILL NOT 
SPOIL YOUR OLYMPICS, WE WILL 
SEND OUR ATHLETES THERE, AND HE 
GO MOON JAE-IN TO DO SOME WORK 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, TO ALLOW 
THAT DIPLOMACY TO MOVE FORWARD, 
TO CONVINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP 
REALLY TO CONVINCE THEM IT 
WOULD BE WORTH HIS WHILE TO SIT 
DOWN WITH HIM. 
THERE WAS THE EXTRAORDINARY 
MOMENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THE 
SOUTH KOREAN ENVOY SHOWED UP, 
THEY BRIEFED PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
AND SAID THAT KIM JONG-UN WANTS 
TO HAVE A SUMMIT, AND HE SAID 
THEY CAN ANNOUNCE THAT ON THE 
DRIVEWAY. 
THAT CAME AS A SURPRISE TO 
PEOPLE AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THIS 
HAS MOVED AT LIGHTNING SPEED, 
AND IF THIS IS SOMETHING 
OMPREHENSIVE, SOMETHING THAT 
NORTH KOREA IS MAKING SOME BIG 
CONCESSIONS TO GIVE SOMETHING 
UP, THAT WILL BE PRETTY 
HISTORIC, ON THE OTHER HAND, IF 
THIS IS JUST VAGUE PROMISES, 
JUST KEEP TALKING, I'M GLAD WE 
ARE GETTING ALONG, KIND OF 
AGREEMENT, I DON'T THINK THAT 
WILL PLAY AS WELL IN THE UNITED 
STATES AS IT MIGHT PLAY IN 
NORTH KOREA, AND NORTH KOREA 
HAS THE UPPER HAND, BECAUSE 
THEY CAN CONTROL THE MESSAGE IN 
THEIR COUNTRY.>> BEN TRACY, 
PROVIDING MUCH-NEEDED CONTEXT 
ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED ON 
THIS HISTORIC DAY, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH, THAT WAS IMPORTANT 
STUFF WE DISCUSSED, THANK YOU 
FOR TAKING THE TIME TO DISCUSS 
WITH US.
>>> WE WOULD TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK, MUCH MORE SUMMIT 
COVERAGE WE COME BACK, I'M 
STARTING TO LOSE MY VOICE I 
THINK, WE ARE GOING TO 
>>> WELCOME BACK TO CBS NEWS'S 
COVERAGE OF THE HISTORIC 
MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND KIM JONG-UN, JUST MOMENTS 
AGO,  THE PRESIDENT AND THE 
CHAIRMAN SIGNING WHAT WAS 
CALLED BY THE PRESIDENT A 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, I WANT 
TO SAY LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT HE 
SAID, HE SAID TO REPORTERS, YOU 
WILL SEE EVERYTHING IN JUST A 
LITTLE WHILE, THE LETTER THAT 
WE ARE SIGNING IS VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE, AND I THINK BOTH 
SIDES ARE GOING TO BE IMPRESSED 
WITH THE RESULT, A LOT OF 
GOODWILL WENT INTO THIS, A LOT 
OF WORK IN PREPARATION. 
CHAIRMAN KIM SAID THAT TODAY 
WAS A HISTORIC MEETING, AND 
NORTH KOREA AND THE UNITED 
STATES DECIDED TO LEAVE THE 
PAST BEHIND, AND WE ARE ABOUT 
TO SIGN A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, 
THE WORLD WILL SEE A MAJOR 
CHANGE, AND HE EXPRESSED HIS 
GRATITUDE PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 
MAKING THIS HAPPEN. 
ISAAC STONE FISH IS A SENIOR  
INTRUDER, AND A FELLOW ON U.S. 
AND CHINA RELATIONS, HE JOINS 
ME NOW. 
WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING HISTORY 
IN THE MAKING, ISAAC, AND NOW 
WE ARE ON PINS AND NEEDLES 
TRYING TO SURMISE WHAT THIS 
HISTORIC DOCUMENT, WHAT 
CHAIRMAN KIM CALLED A HISTORIC 
DOCUMENT IS, TO USE THAT 
LANGUAGE, HISTORIC, FROM KIM, 
COMPREHENSIVE FROM TRUMP, IF IT 
TURNS OUT TO BE A GENERIC -- I 
CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT COULD BE, 
GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE HEARD FROM 
THE TWO LEADERS.
>> I AM DYING TO SEE WHAT IS IN 
THE DOCUMENT, AND TO KNOW. 
I THINK TRUMP HAS MOVED BACK 
AND FORTH BETWEEN MANAGING 
EXPECTATIONS AND SAYING YES, 
THIS IS TREMENDOUS, THIS IS 
AWESOME, THIS IS GREAT. 
COULD BE SOMETHING -- MAY BE 
FOR OUR OWN PSYCHE SAKE, WE 
SHOULD GET OUR HOPES UP, IT 
COULD BE SOMETHING MORE 
MEASURED THAN WE ARE EXPECTING, 
THAT THE U.S. SIDE WILL SPEND 
AS A MASSIVE BREAKTHROUGH, AND 
TO BE FAIR, THE FACT THAT THIS 
IS HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE 
IS ALREADY A HUGE BREAKTHROUGH, 
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHERE WE 
ARE IN THE PAST. 
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING OVER 
THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HOURS, 
ABOUT CHINA'S ROLE, I WANT TO 
READ A TWEET THAT CAME FROM THE 
PEOPLE'S DAILY, A CHINESE 
APPARATUS NEWS ORGANIZATION, 
BUT THE TWEET SAYS THAT CHINA 
WELCOMES AND SUPPORTS THE 
HISTORY MAKING TALKS BETWEEN 
NORTH KOREA AND U.S. LEADERS, 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN 
IMPORTANT ROLE TO SOLVE THE 
ISSUE. WE TALK ABOUT WHAT 
BEIJING MIGHT BE WONDERING 
ABOUT WHAT THIS IS, WAS GOING 
ON, THE RELATIONSHIP, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN HAVE, AND 
WE ARE SEEING THAT THEY ARE 
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS, IT GOES 
BACK TO THE POINT THAT WE MADE 
EARLIER, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE 
CHAIRMAN KIM WOULD MAKE A MOVE 
WITHOUT HAVING AGREED TO THE 
MOVE BEFORE THE MEETING? 
>> PUBLICLY, THEY ARE SHOWING A 
SIGN OF SUPPORT, I WOULD LOVE 
TO KNOW WHAT THEY ACTUALLY 
THINK ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. 
 IT DOES FEEL 
LIKELY THAT ONE OF THE REASONS 
THAT KIM JONG-UN MET FOR A 
SECOND TIME WITH CHINESE 
CHAIRMAN XI JINGPING WAS TO 
DISCUSS WHAT HE WAS ALLOWED TO 
DO OR SAY IN THAT SUMMIT,  
ANOTHER GOOD REMINDER OF HOW 
IMPORTANT CHINA IS, A MASSIVE 
COUNTRY, ONE .4 BILLION PEOPLE, 
NORTH KOREA, REMOTE, POOR, 25 
MILLIN PEOPLE, ANOTHER 
REMINDER THAT PROBABLY THE ROAD 
TO PYONGYANG GOES THROUGH 
BEIJING, AND IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE AS THE 
COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS UNFOLD, 
WHETHER OR NOT NORTH KOREA DOES 
TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM BEIJING, 
AND TRY TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE 
UNITED STATES, OR WHETHER OR 
NOT, WITH TENSIONS A BIDDING 
BETWEEN UNITED STATES NORTH 
KOREA, NORTH KOREA HAS A MORE 
COMFORTABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CHINA, AND THE U.S. CAN TURN 
ITS ATTENTION ELSEWHERE.>> WE 
WERE TALKING TO BEN TRACY, WHO 
HAS TRAVELED TO NORTH KOREA, HE 
DID MAKE THE POINT THAT IT DOES 
SEEM THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
TOTALITY OF WHAT WE HAVE 
WITNESSED OVER THE LAST 18 TO 
36 MONTHS, THE NORTH KOREANS, 
STEP-BY-STEP, APPLYING A 
CERTAIN STRATEGY TO GET THEM TO 
THIS POINT HERE, AND I KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE HAS BEEN 
PREPARING FOR THIS HIS ENTIRE 
LIFE, BUT OTHER REPORTS SAID 
THAT HE HAD READ A LOT OF THE 
BRIEFING REPORTS, AND HE WOULD 
GO ON WHAT HAS MADE HIM 
SUCCESSFUL, HE HAS ARGUED IN 
THE PAST, WHICH IS HIS GUT AND 
INSTINCT, HE SAID THIS WE CAN, 
HE WOULD KNOW WITHIN A MINUTE 
OR SO, WHETHER CHAIRMAN KIM WAS 
SERIOUS ABOUT NEGOTIATIONS, 
BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN 
TODAY, SOME LEVEL OF 
SERIOUSNESS, DISPLAYED BY THE 
CHAIRMAN, THAT ALLOWED 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MOVE FORWARD 
WITH HIS AGENDA. 
IT DOES SEEM INTERESTING, THAT 
AS HE POINTED OUT, THE NORTH 
KOREANS, ONCE THEY HAD THE 
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY, ONCE THEY 
HAD A NUCLEAR WEAPON THAT WAS 
ABLE TO BE PLACED ON A 
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC 
MISSILE AGAINST UNITED STATES, 
CHAIRMAN KIM SAID NOW WE CAN 
TALK, NOW WE WANT TO FOCUS ON 
THE ECONOMY, WHICH IS WHERE THE 
UNITED STATES COMES IN. 
TO PROVIDE RELIEF BY REMOVING 
SANCTIONS. 
YOU SEE IT THAT WAY AS A 
STRATEGIC MOVE, BY THE NORTH 
KOREANS, AS OPPOSED TO ONE DONE 
BY THE MEDIATION BY SOUTH KOREA 
AND CHINA?
>> IT IS HARD TO KNOW HOW MUCH 
CREDIT TO GIVE THE NORTH KOREANS
, A SHAMBOLIC POLITY ON SO MANY 
LEVELS, THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF 
SOPHISTICATED NEGOTIATIONS THE 
PAST, IS THIS A CAREFUL PLAN BY 
KIM JONG-UN OVER THESE LAST 
YEARS, THE BEST WAY TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE NINE STATES, 
OR HAVE THEY BEEN STEP-BY-STEP 
SAYING, THIS IS WHERE WE ARE 
RIGHT NOW, LET'S IMPROVISE, USE 
WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US, 
AND MAKE THE MOST OF A BAD 
SITUATION. 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS KNOWN AS AN 
IMPROVISER, A DISRUPTOR, COULD 
IT BE THAT THIS COULD ONLY 
HAPPEN BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS, 
I'M NOT COMPARING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TO A BRUTAL DICTATOR, BUT 
THE IDEA OF THE PERSONALITY OF 
THESE INDIVIDUALS, 
UNPREDICTABLE, SORT OF 
INSTINCTUAL, IS THAT SOMETHING 
THAT PERHAPS MIGHT'VE PLAYED 
INTO THIS? 
>> I THINK IT CERTAINLY DID, 
BUT I THINK IT WOULD CERTAINLY 
BE POSSIBLE THAT ANOTHER U.S. 
PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE DECIDED TO 
MEET WITH A NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER, BILL CLINTON CAME VERY 
CLOSE, THE CLOSEST, IN 2000, 
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT WENT TO 
PYONGYANG, SHE MET WITH HIS 
FATHER, AND CLINTON WAS VERY 
CLOSE TO GOING, BUT HE DECIDED 
TO FOCUS ON ISRAEL AND 
PALESTINE, ANOTHER VERY 
DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO SOLVE. 
AND HE LOST THE CHANCE TO BE 
THE FIRST U.S. PRESIDENT TO BE 
WITH A SITTING NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER. 
SO INSTEAD, WE HAVE TRUMP DOING 
THAT, AND I THINK IT WAS TRUMP 
DECIDING SOME HUBRIS, PERHAPS 
SOME GOOD JUDGMENT INVOLVED 
SOMEWHERE, BUT DECIDING THE WAY 
TO SOLVE THIS, IS FOR ME TO SIT 
DOWN AND MEET WITH THE NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER.>> WHEN WE GET TO 
THE LANGUAGE OF THIS 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, AS THE 
PRESIDENT CALLED IT, I'M SURE 
ANALYSTS WHO HAVE STUDIED THE 
REGION CLOSELY FOR MANY YEARS, 
THAT WILL BE LOOKING FOR 
SIMILAR LANGUAGE IN OTHER 
AGREEMENTS, THAT THE NORTH 
KOREANS HAVE SIGNED WITH THE 
UNITED STATES. 
HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO TELL, I 
WILL BE ABLE TO TELL, IT WILL 
BE NEW TO ME, BUT WHAT WILL YOU 
BE LOOKING FOR THAT WILL GIVE 
YOU SOME INDICATION THAT THIS 
IS A SERIOUS MOVE BY THE NORTH 
KOREANS, OR WE HAVE SEEN THIS 
IN THE PAST, IN 1994, AND THESE 
ARE THE TIMES?
>> FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY 
GATES SAID YOU DON'T WANT TO 
BUY THE SECOND HORSE, WILL 
WOULD BE BUYING A HORSE FOR THE 
THIRD TIME. 
-- WILL WE BE BUYING A HORSE 
FOR THE THIRD TIME? 
THE LEVEL OF DETAIL, THE 
GUIDELINES, THE GUIDE RAILS, AS 
TO HOW THIS AGREEMENT IS GOING 
TO BE ENFORCED. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF TIME 
TO PUT THIS TOGETHER, I WILL BE 
VERY SURPRISED IF THIS IS A 
DETAILED PLAN TOWARDS 
DENUCLEARIZATION, BUT WHAT I 
WILL BE LOOKING FOR IS 
SOMETHING THAT SHOWS THAT THIS 
IS UNPRECEDENTED, SOMETHING 
LIKE A CESSATION OF THE KOREAN 
WAR, AS OPPOSED TO TWO SIDES 
AGREED TO DO THIS, THEY ARE 
ACTUALLY DOING THIS. 
WE ARE TAKING THE STEP, AS 
OPPOSED TO WE AGREED TO TAKE 
THE STEP. 
>> THAT IS A GOOD POINT, 
BECAUSE FOR ME, WHEN WE 
ULTIMATELY GET THE WORDING OF 
THIS DOCUMENT, AND UNDERSTAND 
WHAT IS IN IT, IS WELL, THEY 
HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE, THIS IS 
NOT NEW. 
WHAT WOULD HAVE TO BE NEW? 
VERIFICATION, ALLOWING 
SPECTERS, -- INSPECTORS, 
FREEZING OF THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
PROGRAM? 
WHAT WOULD BE NEW?
>> THEY HAVE ALLOWED INSPECTORS 
IN THE PAST, TEAM AMERICA, HANS 
BLIX, THAT WHOLE THING, THE END 
OF THE KOREAN WAR, THAT WOULD 
BE NEW, VERY CONCRETE STEPS, 
THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE ARE 
GOING TO IN THE KOREAN WAR. 
NORMALIZING DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS, THAT WOULD BE NEW. 
THAT WOULD BE HUGE. 
OR THE AGREEMENT, KIM JONG-UN 
AT THIS POINT IS GOING TO COME 
TO THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR A STATE 
VISIT, THAT WOULD BE VERY BIG, 
CERTAINLY A VERY FAR WAY FOR 
KIM JONG-UN TO TRAVEL, 
UNPRECEDENTED. 
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING IT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN, HE SAID THAT 
HE EXPECTS THAT THEY WILL BE 
MEETING, MEANING HIMSELF AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM, AGAIN, AND HE 
SAID MANY TIMES. 
YOU KNOW, NO COUNTRY THAT HAS 
HAD THE KIND OF REGIME THAT KIM 
HAS, HAS EVER VISITED THE WHITE 
HOUSE, SADDAM HUSSEIN, QADDAFI, 
THOSE OTHER BRUTAL DICTATORS. 
THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS STEP 
FOR SURE.
>> IT IS INTERESTING, WE HAVE 
SEEN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE HAD 
HORRIFIC REGIMES EVOLVE INTO 
ALLIES OF THE UNITED STATES, 
JAPAN IS A GREAT EXAMPLE, NOT 
VERY LONG AFTER THE APPLICATION 
OF THE EMPEROR, AND THE FALL OF 
THAT GOVERNMENT, THE U.S. AND 
JAPAN HAD QUITE A GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
GERMANY IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE. 
BUT A LEADER WHO HAS BEEN ON 
BOTH SIDES. 
>>> STANDBY, WE EXPECT THAT 
THERE IS GOING TO BE A PRESS 
CONFERENCE AT 2:30 PM, AND IT 
IS ABOUT 2:20 PM, WE ARE GOING 
TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK TO GIVE 
OUR VIEWERS A PRESS CONFERENCE, 
WE HOPE TO GET MORE INFORMATION 
ABOUT THIS CONFERENCE OF 
DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED 
EARLIER TODAY, STAY WITH US, 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. , 
THIS IS CBSN. 
ALWAYS ON.. 
>>>  WELCOME BACK TO CBS NEWS'S 
COVERAGE  OF THE HISTORIC 
SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND CHAIRMAN KIM OF NORTH 
KOREA, WE ARE EXPECTING THE 
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES TO 
GIVE A PRESS CONFERENCE TO GIVE 
DETAILS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE 
DOCUMENT HE SIGNED, JUST ABOUT 
HALF AN HOUR AGO, THE PRESIDENT 
SAID IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE 
DOCUMENT, WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAD 
WORKED ON FOR QUITE SOME TIME, 
NO DETAILS YET, BUT SOME 
DETAILS ARE EKING THEIR WAY 
OUT. 
I AM JOINED HERE BY ISAAC STONE 
FISH,  ISAAC, YOU ARE SEEING 
FROM SOME SOURCES THAT SOME OF 
THOSE DETAILS ARE COMING OUT, 
AND WHAT IS YOUR FIRST THOUGHT? 
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD? 
>> THEY SEEM TO BE QUITE VAGUE 
SO FAR, BOTH SIDES AGREE, NONE 
OF THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED, 
WHAT WE THINK WE ARE SEEING IS 
THEY AGREED TO WORK TOWARDS 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION, 
AGREE TO EXCHANGE OPINIONS, A 
LOT OF LANGUAGE LIKE THAT, I 
COULD BE PROVEN WRONG, AND JUST 
A FEW MINUTES, BUT IT REALLY 
SEEMS TO BE A WHOLE LOT OF 
NOTHING. 
WHEN IT COMES TO THE AGREEMENTS 
THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH NORTH 
KOREA IN THE PAST. 
>> LET'S GO TO ZEKE MILLER, 
WHITE HOUSE REPORTER FOR THE 
ASSOCIATED PRESS, IN SINGAPORE, 
TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
WE ARE AWAITING THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE, WONDERING IF YOU 
HAVE ANY MORE DETAILS ABOUT 
THIS DOCUMENT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID WAS 
COMPREHENSIVE?>> THE TIME OF 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, IT WON'T 
BE 2:30 PM, ORIGINALLY 
SCHEDULED AT 4 PM, WAITING FOR 
A NEW UPDATED TIMING. 
ON THE DOCUMENT, WE ARE SEEING 
THE FIRST PAGE, THAT WAS 
CAPTURED BY PHOTOGRAPHERS, THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT 
PROVIDED A ADDITIONAL READOUT, 
BLURRY ZOOM IN PHOTOS, WE ARE 
REPORTING THAT WE CAN FIGURE 
OUT SOMETHING OF WHAT WAS SAID, 
IT APPEARS TO BE VERY VAGUE 
AGREEMENTS, BULLET POINTS, ON 
ONE PAGE OR PATIENT HAVE, THE 
NORTH IS AGREEING TO STANDBY 
ITS DECLARATION TO BEGIN THE 
PROCESS OF DENUCLEARIZATION, 
BUT NO TIMEFRAME, A DISCUSSION 
OF ACCOUNTING FOR TROOPS WHO 
ARE MIA FROM THE KOREAN WAR, AND
AS WELL, THERE IS A SECURITY 
COMMITMENT FROM UNITED STATES 
NORTH KOREA, THE PEACE AND 
PROSPERITY, IF IT GOES THROUGH. 
THAT IS BASICALLY ALL WE HAVE 
LEARNED, WE ARE YET TO HEAR 
MORE FROM THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF,
WHAT WAS BEHIND THE AGREEMENT 
AS WELL IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
HOURS. 
>> IN FACT, Z, WE ARE SHOWING 
AN IMAGE THERE, AS THE 
PRESIDENT HAS THIS HABIT OF 
HOLDING OF DOCUMENTS THAT HE 
SIGNS FOR THE PRESS, IIC, AND 
THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING 
TO, WE CAN SEE SOME OF THE 
THINGS YOU JUST INDICATED, THE 
FOUR BULLET POINTS, A COUPLE OF 
PARAGRAPHS, FOLLOWED BY THE 
SIGNATURES OF PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND CHAIRMAN KIM, THE LANGUAGE 
THAT IS USED, IN THE DOCUMENT, 
SOME OF THE SOURCES ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA, COMMIT, THEY COMMIT TO 
DOING SOMETHING, THAT HAS NOT, 
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, NOTHING 
CONCRETE ESTABLISHED THAT 
DOCUMENT THAT WE HAD ON THE 
SCREEN.>> EXACTLY RIGHT, THIS 
IS SOMETHING THE NORTH HAS DONE 
BEFORE, A COMMITMENT TO GO 
ABOUT A PROCESS IS VERY 
DIFFERENT TO AN AGREEMENT ON 
THE SUBSTANCE, IT IS VERY BARE-
BONES. 
THE SORT OF THING THAT TO 
DIPLOMATS, IN A ROOM ANYWHERE 
COULD ESTABLISH A PROCESS. 
JUST COMING OUT OF THE MEETING 
BETWEEN TWO LEADERS LIKE THIS, 
IT WONDERS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED IN THE 
SITDOWN, THE NORTH HAS GOTTEN 
TO THIS POINT BEFORE, IT HAS 
COMMITTED TO THIS, BUT HASN'T 
FOLLOWED THROUGH. 
THAT WILL BE THE REAL QUESTION. 
A HISTORIC AGREEMENT, WE HEARD 
THAT FROM HIM, AT THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE HE WILL PROBABLY SAY 
THAT, BUT HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT 
FROM OTHER TIMES, WHAT 
ASSURANCES CAN THE PRESIDENT 
GIVE, NOT JUST TO THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE, BUT THE PEOPLE OF THIS 
REGION, WHO LIVE EVERY DAY 
UNDER THE THREAT OF A NUCLEAR 
UMBRELLA, AND A THREAT FROM 
NORTH KOREA, HOW IS THIS 
DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST SEVERAL 
TIMES THAT THE NORTH HAS 
COMMITTED TO DO THIS VERY THING 
THAT THEY COMMITTED TO DO 
TODAY?>> AND SEEK, OVER THE 
COURSE -- SEEK -- ZEKE, WE HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS 
THAT THEY HAVE TRIED TO END THE 
HOSTILITIES THAT EXISTED 
BETWEEN THE COUNTRIES FOR 
DECADES, HAVING COVERED THE G7 
SUMMIT, THIS WE CAN, AND THEN 
FLYING ON TO SINGAPORE TO SEE 
THIS, SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THAT 
THE PRESIDENT USED WITH REGARDS 
TO KIM JONG-UN OVER THE COURSE 
OF TODAY, AFTER THE SIGNING OF 
THIS DOCUMENT, CALLED HIM A 
WORTHY NEGOTIATOR, A TALENTED 
MAN, HE SAID THAT THE MEETING 
WAS FANTASTIC, AND HE SORT OF 
PRAISED KIM JONG-UN, AND WE 
KNOW THIS IS A BRUTAL DICTATOR 
WHO HAS KILLED HIS OWN PEOPLE, 
STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, STARVED 
ANYONE WHO HAS DISAGREED WITH 
HIM, INCLUDING MEMBERS OF HIS 
OWN FAMILY, CONTRAST THAT WITH 
WHAT YOU WITNESSED AT THE G7, 
WITH THE PRESIDENT SAYING FROM 
THE COMFORT OF AIR FORCE ONE, 
ABOUT OUR CLOSEST ALLIES, 
INCLUDING CANADA AND FRANCE, 
CERTAINLY A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THAT I'M GUESSING. 
GIVE THE LANGUAGE THAT HE USED 
WITH THIS DICTATOR, AND THE 
LANGUAGE THAT HE HAS USED ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER 
PLATFORMS WITH CLOSE ALLIES WHO 
HAVE BEEN ALLIES FOR MANY 
YEARS, AS THE CANADIANS HAVE 
INDICATED, 40,000 CANADIAN 
TROOPS FOUGHT ALONG THE UNITED 
STATES -- ALONG WITH UNITED 
STATES OVER THE COURSE OF THOSE 
YEARS.>> THERE IS THIS GENERAL 
SENSE OF THE PRESIDENT USING A 
DIFFERENT TONE TO DISCUSS 
ALLIES, AND PRAISING LEADERS OF 
OPPRESSIVE REGIMES. 
SAYING THAT KIM JONG-UN CARES 
ABOUT HIS PEOPLE, MANY OF HIS 
PEOPLE ARE STARVING, IN FORCED 
LABOR CAMPS, AND HAVE BEEN 
KILLED BY HIS BRUTAL 
GOVERNMENT. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT 
FOR. 
SOME OFFICIALS HAS SAID -- HAVE 
SAID THAT THE CAMPAIGN PROMISE, 
AMERICA FIRST, IN THIS CASE, 
THE WAY THE WHITE HOUSE APPEARS 
TO BE JUST FINE THE RHETORIC, 
IS IN THE HOPES OF MAYBE 
SECURING A NUCLEAR AGREEMENT, 
IT'S OKAY TO USE THIS LANGUAGE 
TO DESCRIBE AN AUTOCRATIC 
LEADER LIKE KIM JONG-UN, AND AT 
THE SAME TIME, TO USE THE 
NEGATIVE LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE 
FRIENDS AND ALLIES, LIKE THE 
CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER AND THE 
LEADERSHIP. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT IT IS PART OF 
HIS NEGOTIATING STYLE, THE 
DEVIL WILL BE CAN HE DELIVER ON 
IT? 
HE HAS A PRO FORMA AGREEMENT 
FROM KIM JONG-UN, HE HAS 
WAGERED SO MUCH ON THIS, WHAT 
IS THE COST OF USING THIS 
RHETORIC TO DESCRIBE THESE 
LEADERS? 
THAT IS AN ANSWER THAT WE WILL 
KNOW TODAY OR TOMORROW, MAYBE 
NOT THIS YEAR, A LONGER 
QUESTION ABOUT THE NATION'S 
CREDIBILITY IF THE PRESIDENT 
CAN'T DELIVER ON THESE 
AGREEMENTS, IF THE RHETORIC 
DOESN'T RESULT IN THIS 
AGREEMENT.
>> WE ARE SHOWING TO OUR 
VIEWERS A COUPLE OF THE 
PARAGRAPHS THAT ARE OF THE 
DOCUMENT, USING THE MAGIC OF 
TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE THE 
IMAGERY, PART OF THE TEXT AS 
HIS, PRESIDENT TRUMP CO 
TO PROVIDE SECURITY GUARANTEES 
TO NORTH KOREA, THE UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA, THE DOCUMENT THAT WE 
ARE SHOWING RIGHT NOW, 
PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN OF THE 
STATE AFFAIRS COMMISSION OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA HAVE COMMITTED TO 
COOPERATE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF NEW U.S. -- DPRK RELATIONS 
IN THE FOR THE PROMOTION OF 
PEACE, PROSPERITY AND SECURITY 
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA  AND 
THE WORLD. 
IT DOES SOUND VERY VAGUE. 
>> THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT. 
THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE AN 
ANNEX TO THIS, SOME OTHER 
DOCUMENT THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN, 
WHAT IS BEHIND THE PRINCIPLES 
THAT ARE LAID OUT HERE? 
THEY ONLY MET FOR SEVERAL HOURS,
IF THIS WAS JUST THE END RESULT,
THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT THEY 
HAVE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, 
THIS IS NOT, THIS IS BARE-
BONES, WHAT A MEETING LIKE THIS 
COULD DELIVER, A PAGE AND A 
HALF, IT PROMISE THAT HAS BEEN 
MADE BEFORE, THE QUESTION IS, 
IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE? 
THAT IS SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 
WILL BE QUESTIONED ON WHEN HE 
HOLDS THIS PRESS CONFERENCE IN 
THE NEXT HOUR OR SO.>> ZEKE 
MILLER, COVERING THE WHITE 
HOUSE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>> ISAAC, THROUGHOUT THE 
COURSE OF OUR COVERAGE OF THE 
STORK SUMMIT, -- THIS HISTORIC 
SUMMIT, HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED THE 
SUMMIT, BUT WHEN YOU SEE SOME 
OF THE LANGUAGE WE ARE SEEING 
FROM THIS DOCUMENT, THE 
PRESIDENT CALLED A 
COMPREHENSIVE, THAT THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT THE WORLD WILL 
SEE IS A MAJOR CHANGE, 
SOMETHING THAT KIM SAID, A 
FANTASTIC MEETING, LOTS OF 
PROGRESS, COMPREHENSIVE 
DOCUMENT, AND HE IS TO PROVIDE 
SECURITY GUARANTEES, AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM REAFFIRMED HIS 
FIRM AND UNWAVERING COMMITMENT. 
HAS HE REAFFIRMED ANYTHING? 
HE HAS NEVER HAD A COMMITMENT TO
DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
>> IF THIS ENTIRE EVENING HAS 
BEEN AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER 
COASTER, WE ARE WAY DOWN HERE, 
THIS WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
REASONABLE TO GO TO THIS AND 
SAY LISTEN, WE HAD A MEETING, 
IT'S GREAT THAT WE MET, WE GOT 
TO KNOW EACH OTHER, NOT MUCH 
CAME OUT OF IT, FINE. 
THEN WE SEE THIS DOCUMENT, AND 
OKAY GREAT, A FIRST STEP, THEY 
MET, WE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING 
THAT WE WERE EXPECTING. 
BUT YOU HAVE TRUMP SING THIS 
WOULD BETTER THAN ANYONE COULD 
HAVE EXPECTED, I EXPECTED IT TO 
GO BETTER, IT WENT WORSE. 
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE FELT THE 
NEED TO LIE TO US ABOUT THE 
QUALITY OF WHAT WAS GOING TO 
COME OUT OF THAT, JUST A 
MEETING WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH. 
>> WE ARE WAITING FOR THE 
ENTIRETY OF THE DOCUMENT, WE 
ARE SHOWING BASICALLY A SCREEN 
GRAB, AGAIN, TO GIVE THE 
PRESIDENT THE BENEFIT, PERHAPS 
IN HIS MIND THIS IS SOMETHING 
COMPREHENSIVE, SOMETHING THAT 
HE WAS GOING FOR, BECAUSE HE 
TENDS TO USE THAT KIND OF 
RHETORIC, SOMETHING THAT WE 
HAVE COME TO EXPECT, HIS 
SUPPORTERS, HE SAYS THINGS GOT 
NOT EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE 
LETTER OF THE LETTER, OF THIS 
DOCUMENT, BUT IN HIS MIND, THIS 
IS A WIN. 
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO BE WITH 
THIS LEADER, AND HE HAS, AND 
THERE IS THIS DOCUMENT, FOR HIM 
IT IS KIND OF A THING HE IS 
EXPECTING A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL 
APPLAUD THEM FOR, BECAUSE NO 
ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS 
DONE BEFORE.>> TO HIM, HE JUST 
HAPPENS TO BE WRONG ON THIS. 
AND LIE WAS NOT A FAIR WORD, WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS INTENTIONS 
WERE, BUT I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO 
FULLY PROCESS AND ANALYZE THIS. 
JUST WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
SEE FROM THE SCREEN GRAB THAT 
IS ON SCREEN RIGHT NOW, THAT 
DOCUMENT COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED 
BETWEEN UNITED STATES AND NORTH 
KOREA FIVE OR 10 YEARS AGO. 
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VIEWED 
AS A MODEST BREAKTHROUGH. 
AND NOW, AFTER THIS MASSIVE 
SUMMIT, UNPRECEDENTED MEETING 
BETWEEN THE TWO DEALERS -- 
LEADERS, THE FACT THAT WE SEEM 
TO BE IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE 
THAT WE WERE BEFORE, IS 
DISAPPOINTING. 
>> THIS WILL ALL BE VIEWED WITH 
THE PRISM OF POLITICS IN THIS 
COUNTRY, AS IT ALWAYS IS, A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTERS OF 
THE PRESIDENT, MEMBERS OF HIS 
OWN PARTY, WILL LOOK TO THE 
PRESENCE TWEET BEFORE THE 
MEETING, WHERE HE CALLED THE 
LOSERS THE HATERS, THOSE WHO 
DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM SUCCEED 
ESSENTIALLY, THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
ACCOMPLISH, AND BECAUSE PEOPLE 
ARE SO CRITICAL OF HIM AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION, THEY ARE GOING 
TO CRITICIZE THIS, NO MATTER 
THE RESULT. 
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE 
ARE SOME CONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE 
ALWAYS CAUTIONED AGAINST 
MEETING WITH NORTH KOREA, 
WITHOUT ANYTHING SIGNED BEFORE 
THE ACTUAL MEETING. 
LET THE UNDERLINGS MEET, THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT MADE, LET THEM 
HAGGLE, AND HAVE THE MEETING, 
WHICH IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A, 
HAVE A, AFTER A COUPLE OF 
DETAILS HAVE BEEN HAMMERED OUT, 
TO SHOW THAT THEY ARE SERIOUS 
IN THEIR INTENTION TO 
DENUCLEARIZE. 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT.
>> HE DID A LITTLE BIT OF THIS 
BEFORE, BUT HIS OTHER INSTINCTS 
TOOK OVER, JUST GO TO THE 
MEETING, AND SAY THIS IS GOING 
TO BE A MEET AND GREET, WE ARE 
NOT GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS 
WITH ANYTHING NEW, PEOPLE HAVE 
CRITICIZED ME FOR SAYING I 
SHOULD MEET WITHOUT GETTING 
SOMETHING FROM THE NORTH 
KOREANS, BECAUSE THE MEETING 
ITSELF IS A CONCESSION, BUT I 
WANT TO GET TO KNOW HIM, I 
BELIEVE DIALOGUE IS IMPORTANT, 
A WAY TO CONDUCT DIPLOMACY. 
DON'T EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE THE 
WORLD, DON'T EXPECT THE KOREAN 
WAR TO END, DON'T EXPECT ALL 
THESE BIG THINGS TO COME OUT OF 
IT. 
WHAT IS REALLY STRIKING A NERVE 
WITH ME IS HIM TRYING TO SAY 
HEY, OBAMA DIDN'T DO IT, I'VE 
DONE IT, AND THIS COULD 
CERTAINLY BE WRONG IN A FEW 
MINUTES, AS MORE COMES OUT, BUT 
IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT TO GIVE 
US THE EXACT SAME THING THAT WE 
HAVE GOTTEN IN THE PAST. 
>> PERHAPS THERE IS AN ANNEX, 
WE DON'T KNOW, A POINT WE MADE 
EARLIER, PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THINK HE IS 
ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS 
THROUGH THE FORCE OF HIS WILL, 
BUT THE IDEA OF AN AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT LEADING -- MEETING 
WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA, 
AS YOU POINTED OUT, AND AS BEN 
TRACY POINTED OUT, YOU WERE 
SAYING IT ALMOST HAPPENED WITH 
BILL CLINTON AND MADELEINE 
ALBRIGHT, THE HEAD OF THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT, THEY WERE GOING TO 
MEET AND HAD ALREADY MET WITH 
HIS FATHER, AND PRESIDENT 
CLINTON WAS INTENT ON MEETING 
WITH KIM JONG ILL -- JONG-IL, 
AND THEY SAID HE WAS NOT 
SERIOUS, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS A 
REPEAT OF THINGS WE HAVE SEEN 
TIME AND TIME AGAIN, BY GIVING 
HIM WHAT HE WANTS, WHICH IS AN 
AUDIENCE WITH YOU COMES TO 
PRESIDENT, THAT WILL PLAY VERY 
WELL FOR HIM BACK HOME, AND 
WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NORTH 
KOREANS? 
>> IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO 
WATCH, IF THERE IS NO ANNEX, IF 
THIS IS ALL WE ARE GETTING, HOW 
PEOPLE IN TRUMP'S ORBIT ARE 
GOING TO SPIN THIS, HOW THIS 
WILL BE SHOWN AS BEING 
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IS COME ON 
THE PAST. 
AGAIN, THERE CERTAINLY COULD BE 
DETAILS THAT I'M MISSING, OR 
COULD BE DIFFERENT NUANCES OF 
THIS, THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN, BUT 
AS A QUICK REACTION, COMPARED 
TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE, 
COMPARED TO THE DRAMA, SUCH A 
FRAUGHT SUMMIT, SO UNSCRIPTED, 
INTENSE AND INCREDIBLE MOMENTS, 
TO HAVE THIS COME OUT OF IT IS 
JUST -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO 
SAY. 
>> WAITING TO SEE WHAT THE 
COMPLETE DETAILS ARE, WE TALKED 
ABOUT ALL THE MOMENTS THAT WE 
WITNESS TODAY, -- WITNESSED 
TODAY, WE GOT A NOTE FROM BEN 
TRACY, HE HAS BEEN TO NORTH 
KOREA MANY TIMES, AND WE DID 
SEE THE MOMENT WHERE WE WERE 
WAITING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM TO COME TO THE 
TABLE, AND WE SAW ONE OF THE 
HANDLERS, FROM THE NORTH KOREAN 
SIDE, WIPING HIS PEN DOWN, THIS 
IS AN INTERESTING NOTE FROM BEN,
THEY WANT -- THEY BRING PENS 
FOR HIM, THEY DON'T WANT HIS 
FINGERPRINTS LEFT BEHIND, AND A 
TOILET, SO THAT NOTHING IS LEFT 
BEHIND. 
THAT IS WHAT YOU GET WITH 
DICTATORS AND DESPOTS, THEY 
KNOW THAT THERE IS AN INTEREST 
IN THEIR FINGERPRINTS OR WHAT 
THEY MIGHT BE -- WHAT THEIR 
HEALTH IS, THEY DON'T WANT 
PEOPLE TO KNOW, THAT IS THE 
DEFINITION OF THIS OPAQUE AND 
UNKNOWABLE HERMIT KINGDOM, 
WHICH IS WHAT NORTH KOREA IS 
CALLED.>> IT IS ALMOST 
PARADOXICAL ABOUT HOW KIM JONG-
UN COULD HAVE SO MUCH POWER, 
AND BE SO PARANOID AND SO 
AFRAID -- AFRAID ABOUT HIS 
RULE, AND SAD IS MAYBE NOT THE 
RIGHT WORD FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
DONE HER AND DOES THINGS, KIND 
OF SAD THAT YOU REACH THAT 
POINT, AND YET YOU SPENT SO 
MUCH TIME FEARING FOR YOUR 
SAFETY.>> A REMARKABLE TURN OF 
EVENTS, A INTERESTING NUGGET, 
HE EXPECTS TO MEET HIM AGAIN, 
SUGGESTIONS, HE WAS ASKED ABOUT 
COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE, I 
DON'T SEE HOW THE CONGRESS 
WOULD ALLOW OR SUPPORT THE IDEA 
OF KIM COMING TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, AND FRANKLY, GIVEN THIS 
DOCUMENT, WHY WOULD HE TRAVEL 
SO FAR FROM THE COMFORT OF 
WHERE HE IS MOST COMFORTABLE, 
TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES, 
GIVEN THAT HE HASN'T REALLY 
COMMITTED TO ANYTHING BASED ON 
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR? 
WE EXPECT TO GET MORE DETAILS 
OF THIS DOCUMENT, THE PRESIDENT 
CALLED COMPREHENSIVE, WE ARE 
GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK, HE 
HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THAT HE 
WOULD BE HOLDING A PRESS 
CONFERENCE AT ABOUT 2:30 AM 
EASTERN TIME, 2:30 PM IN 
SINGAPORE, NOW WE ARE TOLD FROM 
BEN TRACY AND SEEGMILLER, THAT 
IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL 
MUCH LATER. 
LATER AFTER THE BREAK, HEARING 
FROM A CYBER SECURITY ANALYST, 
WHO SAYS THE NORTH ISN'T LIKELY 
TO GIVE UP ITS CYBER SECURITY 
WARFARE PROGRAM ANYTIME SOON. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.  
THIS IS CBSN. 
ALWAYS ON.  
>>> WELCOME BACK, TO OUR 
COVERAGE OF THE HISTORIC 
MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND KIM JONG-UN OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
KOREA, WE HAVE RECEIVED A COPY 
OF THIS JOINT STATEMENT, WHAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED 
COMPREHENSIVE, ISAAC, I'M GOING 
TO GO TO YOU RIGHT AWAY, ONLY A 
COUPLE OF MINUTES BEFORE WE 
TAKE A COMMERCIAL, YOUR 
THOUGHTS? 
>> I AM VERY UNDERWHELMED BY 
THIS DOCUMENT, THE MOST 
STRIKING LANGUAGES WHEN THEY 
CALL THE SUMMIT AN APOCHAL 
EVENT OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS, 
THEY ARE GIVING IT SO MUCH 
IMPORTANCE, MAYBE THINGS WILL 
COME OUT THAT WILL SHOW THIS, 
BUT THE FOUR ITEMS THEY HAVE 
COMMITTED TO, NONE OF THESE 
SEEM AT ALL NEW TO ME. 
ANOTHER STRIKING THING, 
ESTABLISH NEW RELATIONS, BUT 
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT 
ESTABLISHING FORMAL DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONSHIPS. 
AND I THINK TALKING ABOUT 
WORKING TOWARDS THAT WOULD HAVE 
BEEN A BIGGER STEP THAN JUST 
SAYING WE HAVE NEW RELATIONS 
NOW.
>> WE ARE GOING TO DIG INTO THE 
STATEMENT, WHEN WE COME BACK 
FROM THE BREAK, WE HAVE EVEN 
SEEN A NOTE FROM BEN TRACY OUR 
CORRESPONDENCE, THE KEY PHRASE 
SEEMS TO BE WORK TOWARDS 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
THE PENINSULA, IF A, 
NONEXISTENT TIMEFRAME, GETTING 
THAT LANGUAGE, MIGHT MEAN TROOP 
WITHDRAWAL, WE WOULD TAKE A 
QUICK BREAK, LOTS MORE NEWS TO 
COVER, WE EXPECT THE PRESIDENT 
WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT 4 PM 
LOCAL TIME, STAY WITH THIS. 
-- STAY WITH US. 
>>> HI, EVERYONE, I'M VLADIMIR 
DUTHIERS. 
IT IS THREE A -- 3:00 P.M. 
IN SINGAPORE WHERE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND NORTH KOREAN LEADER 
KIM JONG-UN HAVE CONCLUDED THEIR
MEETING OF AN IMPROMPTU SIGN, 
THE DOCUMENT CLAIMS BOTH SIDES 
WILL COOPERATE TO ACHIEVE 
PEACE. 
THE SUMMIT UNFOLDED SIX HOURS 
AGO WHEN THE PAIR FIRST SHOOK 
HANDS AT THE HOTEL ON SENTOSA 
ISLAND. 
IN FRONT OF A BACKDROP OF FLAG. 
THAT WAS THE FIRST MOMENT OF 
THEIR MEETING. 
A FEW MOMENTS LATER, WE HEARD 
FROM THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME. 
>> REALLY GREAT. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT 
DISCUSSION AND TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS. 
WE WILL BE TREMENDOUSLY 
SUCCESSFUL. 
>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE THINKS 
THEY WILL HAVE A TERRIFIC 
RELATIONSHIP. 
KIM JONG-UN SAID IT WAS NOT 
EASY TO GET HERE. 
THEY WENT ON TO HOLD A MEETING 
AND A WORKING LUNCH WITH TOP 
ADVISERS. 
THE PAIR WALKED OUTSIDE THE 
CAPELA HOTEL AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SPOKE TO REPORTERS. 
>> GOING GREAT. 
WE HAD A REALLY FANTASTIC 
MEETING. 
A LOT OF PROGRESS. REALLY VERY 
POSITIVE. 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE 
EXPECTED. 
TOP-OF-THE-LINE, REALLY GOOD. 
WE ARE GOING FOR A SIGNING. 
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SIGN? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HINTED AT AN 
UNSCHEDULED SIGNING. 
JUST AFTER 1:30 LOCAL TIME, WE 
LEARNED WHAT HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT. 
>> WE ARE SIGNING A VERY 
IMPORTANT DOCUMENT. 
PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, 
AND WE'VE HAD A REALLY GREAT 
TURN TOGETHER, A GREAT 
RELATIONSHIP, I'LL BE GIVING A 
NEWS CONFERENCE AT 2:30. 
WHICH IS IN A LITTLE BIT LESS 
THAN TWO HOURS. 
AND WE'LL DISCUSS THIS IN GREAT 
LENGTH. 
IN THE MEANTIME I BELIEVE THEY 
WILL BE HANDING IT OUT ON 
BEHALF OF CHAIRMAN KIM AND 
MYSELF. 
AND WE ARE BOTH VERY HONORED TO 
SIGN THE DOCUMENT. 
THANK YOU. 
>> 
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY 
SOMETHING TO THE PRESS? 
>> 
>> Translator: TODAY WE HAD A 
HISTORIC MEETING AND DECIDED TO 
LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND. 
AND WE ARE ABOUT TO SIGN A 
HISTORIC DOCUMENT. 
>> 
>> Translator: THE WORLD WILL 
SEE A MAJOR CHANGE. 
>> 
>> Translator: I WOULD LIKE TO 
EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO MAKE THIS 
MEETING HAPPEN. 
THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
OKAY. 
>> . 
>> WE ARE STARTING THAT PROCESS 
VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 
>> 
>> DID YOU TALK ABOUT OTTO 
WARMBIER? 
>>  
NUCLEAR ARMS --
>> YOU'LL BE SEEING EVERYTHING 
IN JUST A LITTLE WHILE. 
WITH THE LETTER THAT WE ARE 
SIGNING, IS VERY CONNOR HANSEN, 
AND I THINK BOTH SIDES ARE 
GOING TO BE VERY IMPRESSED WITH 
THE RESULT. 
A LOT OF GOODWILL WENT INTO 
THIS, A LOT OF WORK, A LOT OF 
PREPARATION. 
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY ON 
BOTH SIDES, SECRETARY POMPEO, 
ALL OF HIS COUNTERPARTS, THEY 
WERE ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. 
>> 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THAT'S 
FANTASTIC. 
>> 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY. 
WE'LL SEE YOU A LITTLE BIT VERY 
LATER -- A LITTLE BIT LATER. 
I THINK OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA IS GOING TO BE A VERY 
MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN 
IT HAS IN THE PAST. 
WE BOTH WANT TO DO SOMETHING. 
WE BOTH ARE GOING TO DO 
SOMETHING. 
AND WE'VE DEVELOPED A VERY 
SPECIAL BOND. 
SO PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE VERY 
IMPRESSED, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
BE VERY HAPPY, AND WE ARE GOING 
TO TAKE CARE OF A VERY BIG AND 
DANGEROUS PROBLEM FOR THE 
WORLD. 
AND I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN 
KIM, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME 
TOGETHER TODAY, VERY INTENSIVE 
TIME. 
AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY THAT 
IT WORKED OUT FOR BOTH OF US 
FAR BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD 
HAVE EXPECTED. 
I THINK FAR BETTER -- I WATCHED 
THE VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS -- FAR 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY EVEN 
PREDICTED. 
THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE 
AND MORE AND MORE -- IT'S AN 
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. 
VERY GREAT HONOR, THANK YOU, 
THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOUR 
REPRESENTATIVES VERY MUCH. 
>> 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  
>> ABSOLUTELY I WILL. 
>> MR. KIM, WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
COME TO WASHINGTON? 
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 
>> 
>> ALL RIGHT, THAT HAPPENED 
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. 
SINCE THEN, KIM JONG-UN HAS 
LEFT THE SUMMIT AND WE HAVE 
LEARNED SOME DETAILS ABOUT WHAT 
IS IN THAT DOCUMENT THAT HE AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED. 
EARLIER I SPOKE WITH POLITICAL 
CONTRIBUTOR AND ASSOCIATED 
PRESS WHITE HOUSE REPORTER ZEKE 
MILLER. 
AND WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S EXPECTED NEWS 
CONFERENCE. 
>> Reporter: WE'VE BEEN TOLD 
THAT IT WILL NOT BE 2:30 A.M., 
IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETIME 
LATER. 
WE ARE WAITING ON A NEW UPDATED 
TIMING ON THAT. 
ON THE DOCUMENT, WE ARE JUST 
SEEING THE FIRST PAGE OF THIS 
DOCUMENT, CAPTURED BY 
PHOTOGRAPHERS AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAS 
NOT PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL 
READOUT, BUT VERY BLURRY -- 
BLURRY ZOOMED IN PHOTO 
ELECTRONICS -- NOT ABLE TO 
FIGURE OUT -- SOMETHING WHAT IT 
SAYS AND AS WE WERE DISCUSSING, 
THIS APPEARS TO BE VERY, VERY 
VAGUE AGREEMENT -- YOU KNOW, 
SOME BULLET POINTS SITTING ON A 
PAGE, PAGE AND A HALF, 
INCLUDING SIGNATURES WHERE THE 
NORTH IS AGREEING TO STAND BY 
ITS DECLARATION TO BEGIN THE 
PROCESS OF DENUCLEARIZATION BUT 
REALLY THERE'S NO TIMEFRAME 
THERE. 
THERE IS A DISCUSSION OF TRYING 
TO ACCOUNT FOR TROOPS WHO ARE 
AM A FROM THE KOREAN WAR, -- 
WHO ARE M.I.A. 
AND ALSO A SECURITY AGREEMENT 
-- THE PEACE AND PROSPERITY -- 
IF THIS GOES THROUGH -- THAT'S 
ALL WE'VE LEARNED, EXPECT TO 
HEAR MORE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
HIMSELF IF NOT THIS AGREEMENT 
-- ALSO WHAT'S BEHIND IT IN THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. 
>> IN FACT, WE ARE SHOWING AN 
IMAGE THERE, AS THE PRESIDENT 
HAS THIS HABIT OF HOLDING UP 
DOCUMENTS THAT HE SIGNS FOR THE 
PRESS, TO SEE, AND THAT IS WHAT 
YOU ARE REFERRING TO, WE CAN 
SEE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU 
INDICATED, THOSE FOUR BULLET 
POINTS, BUBBLE PARAGRAPHS 
FOLLOWED BY THE SIGNATURES OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KATE -- 
CHIMACUM. 
THE LANGUAGE THAT IS USED IN 
THE DOCUMENT ACCORDING TO YOU 
AND SOME OTHER SOURCES THAT ARE 
STARTING TO LEAK OUT ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA INCLUDES WORD LIKE 
COMMIT, COMMIT TO DOING 
SOMETHING. 
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANYTHING AS 
FAR AS WE CAN TELL CONCRETE 
ESTABLISHED IN THAT DOCUMENT WE 
JUST HAD UP ON OUR SCREEN. 
>> EXACTLY RIGHT. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THE NORTH HAS 
DONE BEFORE AND THAT IS 
COMMITTING TO A PROCESS IS VERY 
DIFFERENT THAN AN AGREEMENT ON 
THE SUBSTANCE. 
ALL IT IS IS VERY BARE-BONES -- 
THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT 
TWO DIPLOMATS IN A ROOM 
ANYWHERE COULD ESTABLISH A 
PROCESS. 
FOR THIS COMING OUT OF THE 
MEETING BETWEEN TWO LEADERS, 
LIKE THIS, IT GIVES -- RAISES A 
LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHED 
IN A SITDOWN. 
THE NORTH HAS GOTTEN TO THIS 
POINT BEFORE AND HAS COMMITTED 
TO DO MANY OF THESE THINGS. 
SO THAT IS THE REAL QUESTION 
HERE. 
THE PRESIDENT -- WE'VE HEARD 
THAT FOR HIMSELF -- THE 
QUESTION WILL BE, HOW IS THIS 
DIFFERENT FROM OTHER TIMES -- 
WHAT ASSURANCES CAN THE 
PRESIDENT GIVE NOT JUST THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT THE PEOPLE 
IN THIS REGION WHO
LIVE EVERY DAY UNDER THE THREAT 
OF -- NUCLEAR UMBRELLA OF THE 
SORT OF -- FROM NORTH KOREA 
THAT THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- 
THE MESSAGE, HOW IS THIS 
DIFFERENT FROM THE LAST -- THIS 
VERY THING THEY COMMITTED TO DO 
TODAY. 
>> ZEKE, I WANT TO ASK YOU, WE 
HAVE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
LAST FIVE OR SIX HOURS HAVE SO 
HAVE GIVEN PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 
THIS HISTORIC MOMENT THAT WE 
WITNESSED HERE, THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, SITTING 
PRESIDENT
MEETING WITH A NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER TO FIGURE OUT SOME WAY 
TO END THE HOSTILITIES THAT 
HAVE EXISTED BETWEEN OUR 
COUNTRIES FOR DECADES. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, I WONDER, 
HAVING COVERED THE G-7 SUMMIT 
IS WEAKENED, YOU DID, AND 
FLYING ON TO SINGAPORE,
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE THE 
PRESIDENT USED WITH REGARDS TO 
KIM JONG-UN OVER THE COURSE OF 
TODAY, HE, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE 
SIGNING OF THIS DOCUMENT CALLED 
HIM A WORTHY NEGOTIATOR, VERY 
TALENTED MAN, HE SAID THE 
MEETING WAS FANTASTIC, YOU 
KNOW, HE SORT OF PRAISED KIM 
JONG-UN. 
WE KNOW THIS IS A BRUTAL 
DICTATOR WHO HAS KILLED HIS OWN 
PEOPLE, STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, 
STARVED ANYBODY WHO HAS 
DISAGREED WITH HIM INCLUDING 
MEMBERS OF HIS OWN FAMILY. 
CONTRAST THAT WITH WHAT YOU 
WITNESSED AT THE G-7 WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
SAYING, YOU KNOW, FROM THE 
COMFORT OF AIR FORCE ONE, ABOUT 
OUR CLOSEST ALLIES INCLUDING 
CANADA AND FRANCE, YOU KNOW, 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT I'M 
GUESSING. 
GIVEN THE LANGUAGE THAT HE USED 
WITH THIS DICTATOR. 
AND THE LANGUAGE HE HAS USED ON 
SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER 
PLATFORMS WITH OUR CLOSE ALLIES 
WHO HAVE BEEN ALLIES WITH US 
FOR MANY YEARS AS THE CANADIANS 
HAVE, YOU KNOW, INDICATED THAT, 
YOU KNOW, 40,000 TROOPS FOUGHT 
ALONGSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN 
AFGHANISTAN OVER THE COURSE OF 
THOSE YEARS. 
>> Reporter: THAT'S EXACTLY 
RIGHT. 
THERE IS THIS GENERAL SENSE THE 
PRESIDENT IS USING THIS 
DIFFERENT TONE TO DESCRIBE 
ALLIES AND ENEMIES. 
HE HAS PRAISED VLADIMIR PUTIN, 
PRAISED OTHER LEADERS OF 
OPPRESSIVE REGIMES. 
MOST RECENTLY NOW KIM JONG-UN, 
-- WHEN IN FACT SO MANY OF HIS 
PEOPLE ARE STARVING, IN FORCED 
LABOR CAMPS, KILLED BY SORT OF 
THIS BRUTAL GOVERNMENT. 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT 
FOR. 
WE HAVE HEARD OFFICIALS IN THE 
LAST SEVERAL WEEKS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT -- IS COMMITTED TO 
THAT CAMPAIGN PROMISE OF 
AMERICA FIRST. 
WHATEVER IS IN THE AMERICAN 
INTEREST HE WILL DO. 
IN THIS CASE THE WAY THE WHITE 
HOUSE APPEARS TO BE JUSTIFYING 
THIS RHETORIC IS THAT IN THE 
HOPES OF MAYBE SECURING A 
NUCLEAR AGREEMENT IS OKAY FOR 
THE PRESIDENT TO USE THIS 
LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE AUTOCRATIC 
LEADER LIKE KIM JONG-UN. 
ALSO AT THE SAME TIME TO USE 
THAT NEGATIVE LANGUAGE TO 
DESCRIBE FRIENDS AND ALLIES 
LIKE THE PRIME MINISTER AND
THE EU LEADERSHIP. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT'S PART OF HIS 
NEGOTIATING STYLE. 
CAN HE DELIVER ON IT? 
IN THIS CASE, HE HAS A PRO 
FORMA AGREEMENT FROM KIM JONG-
UN BUT CAN HE DELIVER? 
HE HAS WAGERED ON THIS AND WHAT 
IS THE COST? 
USING THE RHETORIC, WE WON'T 
KNOW TODAY OR TOMORROW, MIGHT 
NOT KNOW THIS -- IT'S A LONGER-
TERM QUESTION ABOUT THE 
NATION'S CREDIBILITY ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE IF THE 
PRESIDENT CAN'T DELIVER AND 
USING THIS SORT OF RHETORIC 
DOESN'T ULTIMATELY RESULT IN 
THE AGREEMENT HERE. 
>> LET'S -- WE'RE SHOWING OUR 
VIEWERS RIGHT NOW A COUPLE OF 
THE PARAGRAPHS THAT ARE ON THAT 
DOCUMENT, WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
USE THE MAGIC OF TECHNOLOGY TO 
ENHANCE THE IMAGERY. 
PART OF THE TEXT IS THIS. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMIT TO 
PROVIDE SECURITY GUARANTEES TO 
THE DPRK AND CHAIRMAN OWN -- 
KIM JONG-UN, AND THE DOCUMENT 
WE'RE SHOWING ON OUR SCREEN 
RIGHT NOW, IT SAYS PRESIDENT 
DONALD J. TRUMP OF THE UNITED 
STATES AMERICA AND CHAIRMAN KIM 
JONG-UN OF THE STATE AFFAIRS 
COMMISSION OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA HAVE 
COMMITTED TO COOPERATE FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW 
U.S./DPRK RELATIONS AND FOR PER 
THE MOST -- THE PROMOTION OF 
PEACE, PROSPERITY AND SECURITY 
OF THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND THE 
WORLD. 
IT DOES -- BY WHAT WE ARE 
SEEING HERE -- ONLY ONE PART OF 
THIS DOCUMENT -- SOUNDS VERY 
VAGUE. 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
THE QUESTION IS, IS THERE AN 
ANNEX TO THIS? 
THERE WERE SOME OTHER DOCUMENTS 
THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN? WHAT IS 
BEHIND THE PRINCIPLES LAID OUT 
HERE? 
AND IF IT IS THEY ONLY MET FOR 
SEVERAL HOURS, IF THIS IS JUST 
THE END RESULT, THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING THEY'VE MADE SOME KIND 
OF EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS, THIS 
IS NOT EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS, 
THIS IS BASICALLY BARE-BONES OF 
WHAT A MEETING LIKE THIS COULD 
DELIVER, PAGE AND HAVE 
DOCUMENT. 
PROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE 
BEFORE, THE QUESTION IS, IS 
THERE SOMETHING ELSE, THAT 
WOULD BE SOMETHING THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD BE QUESTIONED 
ON WHEN HE HOLDS HIS PRESS 
DIFFERENT -- CONFERENCE IN THE 
NEXT HOUR. 
>> ASSOCIATED PRESS WHITE HOUSE 
REPORTER ZEKE MILLER COVERING 
THE WHITE HOUSE, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH, WE WILL CHECK BACK IN 
WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> YOU SEE SOME OF THE 
LANGUAGE WE ARE SEEING RIGHT 
NOW FROM THIS DOCUMENT, THE 
PRESIDENT CALLED IT COMPETENCE 
OF, SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT THE WORLD WILL SEE AS A 
MAJOR CHANGE, SOMETHING THAT 
KIM SAID. 
FANTASTIC MEETING, LOTS OF 
PROGRESS, YUM BRANDS OF 
DOCUMENT. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMIT TO 
PROVIDE SECURITY GUARANTEES TO 
THE DPRK AND CHAIRMAN KIM 
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
REAFFIRMED -- WHAT IS -- THAT 
IS, SORT OF, HE'S NEVER HAD A 
COMMITMENT TO DENUCLEARIZING 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
>> THIS ENTIRE EVENING HAS BEEN 
AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER. 
WE STARTED HERE AND NOW WE ARE 
WAY DOWN HERE. 
THIS WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. 
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY 
REASONABLE FOR TRUMP TO GO INTO 
THIS AND SAY, LISTEN, WE HAD A 
MEETING, IT WAS GREAT THAT WE 
MET, WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER. 
NOT MUCH CAME OUT OF IT, FINE. 
THEN WE SEE THIS DOCUMENT AND 
WE SEE, GREAT, A FIRST STEP, 
THEY MET, WE DIDN'T GET 
ANYTHING THAT -- WE WEREN'T 
EXPECTING ANYTHING. 
BUT YOU HAVE TRUMP SAY THIS 
WENT BETTER THAN ANYONE COULD 
HAVE EXPECTED. 
I EXPECTED IT TO GO BETTER AND 
IT WENT WORSE. 
I DON'T KNOW WHY HE FELT THE 
NEED TO LIE TO US ABOUT THE 
QUALITY OF WHAT WAS GOING TO 
COME OUT OF THAT. 
JUST MEETING WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ENOUGH. 
>> WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE 
ENTIRETY OF THE DOCUMENT, WE'VE 
BEEN SHOWING WHAT IS BASICALLY 
A SCREEN GRAB. 
AGAIN, TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT 
SORT OF THE BENEFIT, PERHAPS IN 
HIS MIND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
IS CUMBRIAN SAID, MAYBE THIS IS 
SOMETHING HE WAS GOING FOR AND 
BECAUSE HE TENDS TO USE THAT 
KIND OF RHETORIC, IT IS 
SOMETHING WE HAVE ALL COME TO 
EXPECT, SUPPORTERS HAVE COME TO 
EXPECT, HE SAYS THINGS AND IT'S 
NOT EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE 
LETTER OF THE LETTER OR THIS 
DOCUMENT BUT IN HIS MIND THIS 
IS SORT OF A WIN. 
AND HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO 
MEET WITH THE LEADER AND HE 
HAS. 
AND THERE'S THE DOCUMENT AND 
FOR HIM IT'S KIND OF A THING 
THAT HE IS EXPECTING A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WILL APPLAUD HIM FOR 
BECAUSE NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO 
GET THIS DONE BEFORE. 
>> TO HIM. 
YEAH. 
THAT'S -- HE HAPPENS TO BE 
WRONG ON THIS. 
LIE WAS NOT A FAIR WORD BECAUSE 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS 
INTENTIONS WERE, BUT I HAVEN'T 
HAD TIME TO FULLY
PROCESS AND ANALYZE -- 
>> WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE WHOLE 
THING. 
>> WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE 
FROM THE SCREEN GRAB ON THE 
SCREEN RIGHT NOW, THAT DOCUMENT 
COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN 
THE UNITED STATES AND NORTH 
KOREA FIVE, TEN YEARS AGO. 
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VIEWED AS A 
MODEST BREAKTHROUGH. 
NOW AFTER THIS MASSIVE SUMMIT, 
UNPRECEDENTED MEETING BETWEEN 
THE TWO LEADERS, THE FACT THAT 
WE SEEM TO BE IN THE EXACT SAME 
PLACE WE WERE BEFORE ALL OF 
THIS I THINK IS PRETTY 
DISAPPOINTING. 
>> THIS WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH 
THE PRISM OF POLITICS IN THIS 
COUNTRY AS IT ALWAYS IS. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
SUPPORTERS OF THE PRESIDENT AND 
MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY WILL LOOK 
TO THE PRESIDENT'S TWEET FROM 
BEFORE THE MEETING HAPPENED 
WHERE HE CALLED THE LOSERS AND 
HATERS, THOSE THAT DON'T WANT 
TO SEE HIM SUCCEED ESSENTIALLY. 
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HE 
HAS BEEN TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH 
AND BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO 
CRITICAL OF HIM AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY ARE 
GOING TO CRITICIZE THIS NO 
MATTER THE RESULT. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE 
SOME INCLUDING CONSERVATIVES 
WHO HAVE ALWAYS CAUTIONED 
AGAINST MEETING WITH NORTH 
KOREA, WITHOUT ANYTHING SIGNED 
BEFORE THE ACTUAL MEETING. 
LET THE UNDERLINGS MEET, LET 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT, DIPLOMATS 
HAGGLE, SOME OF THE DETAILS, 
AND HAVE THIS MEETING WHICH IF 
YOU WANT TO HAVE IT, HAVE IT 
AFTER A COUPLE OF DETAILS WHERE 
YOU CAN SHOW TO THE WORLD THAT 
NORTH KOREA IS SERIOUS WITH ITS 
INTENTIONS TO DENUCLEARIZE. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. 
ANOTHER THING IS GOING TO THE 
MEETING AND HE DID A LITTLE BIT 
OF THIS BEFORE, BUT HIS OTHER 
INSTINCTS TOOK OVER, SAY, IT IS 
GOING TO BE MEET AND GREET, 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO COME OUT 
WITH ANYTHING NEW. 
I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE CRITICIZED 
ME FOR SAYING I SHOULDN'T MEET 
WITHOUT GETTING SOMETHING FROM 
THE NORTH KOREANS BECAUSE THE 
MEETING ITSELF IS A CONCESSION. 
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW KIM JONG-
UN, DIALOGUE IS IMPORTANT, THIS 
IS A WAY TO CONDUCT DIPLOMACY. 
DON'T EXPECT THIS TO CHANGE THE 
WORLD, DON'T EXPECT ALL OF 
THESE BIG THINGS TO COME OUT OF 
IT. 
WHAT IS STRIKING A NERVE WITH 
ME IS HIM TRYING TO SAY, HEY, 
OBAMA DIDN'T DO IT, BUSH DIDN'T 
DO IT, I'VE DONE IT. 
AND THEN SEEMING AT THIS POINT 
-- THIS COULD BE WRONG IN A FEW 
MINUTES OR AS MORE COMES OUT -- 
SEEMING TO GIVE US THE EXACT 
SAME THING WE'VE GOTTEN IN THE 
PAST. 
>> ZEKE POINTED OUT PERHAPS 
THERE'S AN ANNEX, BUT IT DOES 
SEEM, IT'S A POINT WE MADE 
EARLIER, PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THINK HE'S ABLE 
TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS THROUGH 
THE FORCE OF WILL. 
THE REALITY IS THE IDEA OF AN 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT MEETING WITH 
A LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AS YOU 
POINTED OUT AND AS BEN TRACY 
POINTED OUT, IT -- YOU ARE 
SAYING IT ALMOST HAPPENED WITH 
BILL CLINTON AND MADELINE 
ALBRIGHT. 
AT THE TIME THE HEAD OF THE 
STATE DEPARTMENT. 
YOU KNOW, WAS GOING TO -- HAD 
ALREADY MET WITH JIM AND KIM'S 
FATHER. 
AND PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS 
INTENT ON MEETING WITH KIM JONG-
IL, HIS FATHER. 
AND IT NEVER HAPPENED BECAUSE 
PEOPLE SAID, LOOK, YOU KNOW, 
HE'S NOT SERIOUS. 
WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS 
PROBABLY GOING TO BE A REPEAT 
OF THINGS WE'VE SEEN TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN. 
BY GIVING HIM WHAT HE WANTS 
WHICH IS AN AUDIENCE WITH YOU, 
MR. PRESIDENT, THAT WILL PLAY 
WELL FOR HIM BACK HOME, WON'T 
CHANGE ANYTHING FOR OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NORTH 
KOREANS. 
>> FASCINATING TO WATCH IF 
THERE IS NO ANNEX, IF THIS IS 
ALL THAT WE ARE GETTING, HOW 
PEOPLE IN TRUMP'S ORBIT ARE 
GOING TO SPIN THIS, HOW THIS IS 
GOING TO BE EXPLAINED, SHOWN AS 
BEING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT HAS 
COME OUT IN THE PAST. 
AGAIN THERE'S CERTAINLY -- 
COULD BE A LOT OF DETAILS THAT 
I AM MISSING OR COULD BE 
DIFFERENT NUANCES THAT I 
HAVEN'T SEEN, BUT AS A QUICK 
REACTION, COMPARED TO WHERE WE 
WERE BEFORE, COMPARED TO ALL 
THE DRAMA, SUCH A FRAUGHT 
SUMMIT, SUCH -- SO MANY REALLY 
TENSE AND INCREDIBLE MOMENTS, 
AND TO HAVE THIS COME OUT OF IT 
IS JUST
-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. 
>> AS WE WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE 
DETAILS OF THIS DOCUMENT ARE, 
WE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THE 
MOMENTS WE WITNESSED TODAY AND 
WE GOT A NOTE FROM BEN TRACY 
WHO IS OUR CBS NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT, HE HAS BEEN TO 
NORTH KOREA MANY TIMES, WE DID 
SEE THAT MOMENT WHERE WE WERE 
WAITING FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM TO COME TO THE 
TABLE AND WE WITNESSED -- WE 
SAW ONE OF THE HANDLERS, ONE OF 
HIS HANDLERS FROM THE NORTH 
KOREAN SIDE WIPING HIS PEN 
DOWN. 
THIS IS AN INTERESTING NOTE FOR 
BEN OR FROM BEN, THEY BRING 
PENS EVERYWHERE, THEY DON'T 
WANT HIS FINGERPRINTS
LEFT ON ANYTHING. 
THEY ALSO REPORTEDLY ACCORDING 
TO BEN BURN THE TOILET, SO, NO 
INFO CAN BE GLEANED. 
SERIOUSLY. 
IT IS INTERESTING, THAT'S WHAT 
YOU GET WITH DICTATORS AND 
DESPOTS. 
THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S AN 
INTEREST IN THEIR FINGERPRINTS 
OR WHAT THEY MAY BE -- WHAT 
THEIR HEALTH IS AND THEY DON'T 
WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW. 
THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF THIS 
OPAQUE AND UNKNOWABLE -- HERMIT 
KINGDOM. 
>> CERTAINLY. 
ALMOST PERFECT -- PARADOXICAL 
HOW SOMEONE LIKE KIM JONG-UN 
SOUP -- COULD HAVE SO MUCH 
POWER AND BE SO PARANOID AND SO 
AFRAID FOR HIS OWN LIFE AND 
SAFETY. 
IT'S KIND OF SAD THAT PEOPLE 
WHO REACH THE PINNACLE AND WHO 
ARE DICTATORS, MAYBE SAD IS NOT 
THE RIGHT WORD FOR PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE DONE HORRENDOUS THINGS -- 
I THINK IT IS KIND OF SAD THAT 
YOU REACH THAT POINT AND YET 
YOU SPEND SO MUCH TIME FEARING 
FOR YOUR SAFETY. 
>> RIGHT. 
IT IS SUCH A REMARKABLE TURN OF 
EVENTS AND SUCH AN INTERESTING 
NUGGET. 
THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE EXPECT 
TO MEET CHAIRMAN KIM AGAIN, 
SUGGESTIONS THAT HE WAS ASKED 
WHETHER HE WOULD COME TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE, GIVEN THIS 
DOCUMENT I DON'T SEE HOW THE 
CONGRESS WOULD ALLOW -- NOT 
ALLOW BUT SUPPORT THE IDEA OF 
KIM COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND GIVEN THIS DOCUMENT, I 
DON'T THINK HE WOULD DO IT, WHY 
WOULD HE TRAVEL SO FAR FROM THE 
COMFORTS OF WHERE HE IS MOST 
COMFORTABLE TO COME TO THE 
UNITED STATES? 
GIVEN THAT HE ISN'T COMMITTED 
TO ANYTHING BASED ON WHAT WE'VE 
SEEN SO FAR? 
>>> YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LIVE 
PICTURE FROM SINGAPORE WHERE 
MOMENTS FROM NOW IN A HALF HOUR 
OR SO WE EXPECT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE, 
YOU CAN SEE THE PODIUM ALONG 
WITH THE GREAT SEAL THE UNITED 
STATES ON THAT PODIUM, FAIRLY 
LARGE CROWD OF REPORTERS 
WAITING FOR THE PRESIDENT TO 
APPEAR WHERE HE WILL ANSWER 
QUESTIONS, HOPEFULLY TAKE 
SEVERAL QUESTIONS BECAUSE IT'S 
BEEN QUITE SOME TIME SINCE THE 
PRESIDENT HAS HELD A FORMAL 
CONFERENCE. 
OTHER THAN BILATERAL NEWS 
CONFERENCES WITH OTHER WORLD 
LEADERS. 
WE WILL BRING IT TO YOU LIVE ON 
CBSN. 
>>> LET'S GET TO STATE 
DEPARTMENT REPORTER KYLIE 
ATWOOD JOINING ME RIGHT NOW 
LIFE FROM SINGAPORE. 
KYLIE, GREAT TO SEE YOU. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT 
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED 
COMPREHENSIVE BUT ISAAC STONE 
FISH, ONE OF OUR EXPERTS, SAID 
WAS SORT OF DISAPPOINTING. 
HELP YOUR AUDIENCE UNDERSTAND 
THE CONTEXT OF THIS DOCUMENT, 
THIS JOINT STATEMENT BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN 
KIM JONG-UN THAT WE SAW SIGNS 
AN HOUR AGO. 
>> Reporter: I THINK THE BOTTOM 
LINE HERE IS THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN DID SIGN 
SOMETHING. 
AND THAT IS AN AGREEMENT TO 
CONTINUE TALKS, TO CONTINUE 
WORKING ON WHAT IS THE U.S. 
GOAL, THE GOAL OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN -- OF DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT IF 
TRUMP WAS GOING TO WALK OUT OF 
THIS MEETING TODAY. 
HOW HE WAS GOING TO GET ALONG 
WITH KIM JONG-UN. 
OBVIOUSLY THEY HAD DECENT 
CHEMISTRY. 
THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT OF THE 
MEETINGS AND HE SAID THEY HAD A 
SPECIAL BOND. 
HE DESCRIBED KIM JONG-UN AS 
SOMEONE WHO WAS TALENTED AND 
SOMEONE WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY. 
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS ONE OF THE 
WORST DICTATORS IN THE WORLD 
THAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. 
WHAT IT DEMONSTRATES IS THAT 
THE PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO 
CONTINUE WORKING WITH KIM JONG-
UN TO ACHIEVE THE LONG-STANDING 
GOAL OF DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THIS DOCUMENT ISN'T LAYING OUT 
THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THEY ARE 
GOING TO GET THERE JUST YET. 
>> IN FACT AS YOU POINT OUT, 
IT'S NOT SPECIFIC, IT IS VERY 
VAGUE AND THERE ARE FOUR BULLET 
POINTS HERE THAT ACCORDING TO 
THE EXPERTS WE HAVE SPOKEN TO 
-- I KNOW THAT GIVEN YOUR 
COVERAGE AS THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT REPORTER YOU SEE 
THIS AS WELL THAT THESE ARE 
THINGS THAT THE NORTH KOREANS 
HAVE AGREED TO IN THE PAST WITH 
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS AND 
HAVE YET TO FOLLOW UP. 
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 
IT'S INTERESTING, EXACTLY 25 
YEARS AGO TODAY, THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION AGREED TO A 
SIMILAR OBJECTIVE WITH NORTH 
KOREA, THEY WERE IN NEW YORK 
MEETING AND THEY BOTH -- BOTH 
AGREED TO DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA SO YOU ARE 
RIGHT, THIS HAS HAPPENED 
BEFORE. 
CRITICS WILL SAY THEY HAVEN'T 
SET ANY CONCRETE PLANS ABOUT 
HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. 
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BREAK 
DOWN NORTH KOREA'S EXTENSIVE 
NUCLEAR PROGRAM? 
THAT HAS SHOWN THAT IT IS 
REALLY SUCCEEDED SCIENTIFICALLY 
AND EXPONENTIALLY SO OVER THE 
LAST YEAR? 
RIGHT? 
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE 
-- I WAS SITTING EARLIER TODAY 
WITH ONE OF OUR CONTRIBUTORS, 
BOB CARLIN, AND HE HAS WORKED 
AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT, HE HAS 
WORKED AT THE CIA COVERING 
NORTH KOREA. 
IN BOTH OF THOSE INSTANCES. 
HE SAID HE WAITED MORE THAN 40 
YEARS TO JUST SEE THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES SHAKE 
HANDS WITH KIM JONG-UN. 
WE SHOULDN'T DEMEAN THE 
HISTORIC NATURE OF WHAT WE SAW 
TODAY. 
IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF HOW 
THEY ARE GOING TO GO FORTH FROM 
HERE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT, 
BECAUSE HE IS DESCRIBED AS A 
CHANGE AGENT, A DISRUPTOR, HE 
HAS SAID THAT HAVING BEEN AN 
OUTSIDER, SOMEONE NOT PART OF 
THE SWAMP, NOT PART OF THE 
WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT AND 
THE STATUS QUO WAS WILLING TO 
DO SOMETHING NO OTHER SITTING 
PRESIDENT HAS DONE WHICH IS TO 
MEET WITH THE NORTH KOREAN 
DICTATOR. 
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT 
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 
TO AT LEAST BE GIVEN -- BEGIN 
THIS PROCESS. 
THE QUESTION WILL BE, DOES THIS 
ND WITH DENUCLEARIZATION? 
THE PRESIDENT, AFTER BAND -- 
BANDYING ABOUT THE IDEA HE 
MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A NOBEL 
PEACE PRIZE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO 
THAT WALK BACK EXPECTATIONS AND 
SUGGESTED THIS WAS GOING TO 
TAKE MANY MONTHS PERHAPS MANY 
YEARS. 
ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT WE DID 
HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT DURING 
THE SIGNING OF THIS DOCUMENT 
WAS THAT IT WAS COMPREHENSIVE. 
AND THAT IT WAS GOING TO AFFECT 
MAJOR CHANGE AND THAT I THINK 
FR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
STUDIED THE NORTH KOREAN 
PROBLEM FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, 
THIS IS A HISTORIC MOMENT AND 
PRESIDENT TRUMP DESERVES CREDIT 
FOR UNDERTAKING IT BUT AT THE 
END OF THE DAY, WILL WE SEE 
MORE OF THE SAME FROM THE NORTH 
KOREANS OR WILL THIS ACTUALLY 
LEAD TO POSITIVE AND LASTING 
CHANGE? 
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS I SPOKE 
WITH SOME NUCLEAR EXPERTS IN 
WASHINGTON THIS WEEK WHO 
VISITED WITH WHITE HOUSE 
OFFICIALS AHEAD OF THE SUMMIT, 
AND THEY WERE WORRIED THAT THE 
WHITE HOUSE WOULD GET OUT TOO 
FAR AHEAD OF THEMSELVES IN THIS 
SUMMIT, COMMIT TO THINGS THEY 
SHOULDN'T BE COMMITTING TO, TOO 
EARLY ON. 
FOR EXAMPLE THEY SAID THERE WAS 
A NEED TO BALANCE SPEED AND 
SAFETY. 
THEY GAVE THAT ADVICE TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY 
IF THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM, THAT TAKES EXPERTS TO 
BREAK DOWN. 
SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE GOING TO SAY THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS GOING FOURTH HERE IN A 
WAY THAT HAS POTENTIAL TO BE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE MEASURED THAN 
SOME EXPERTS WERE WORRIED 
ABOUT. 
HEADING INTO THIS MEETING. 
>> CBS NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT 
REPORTER KYLIE ATWOOD REPORTING 
FOR US FROM SINGAPORE, THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> Reporter: THANKS. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A 
BREAK. 
WHILE WE AWAIT REMARKS BY THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT A LIVE 
PICTURE WHERE WE EXPECT THE 
PRESIDENT WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
CBS NEWS. 
ALWAYS ON. 
>>> WELCOME BACK TO OUR 
COVERAGE OF THE MEETING BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG-UN. 
WE ARE WAITING FOR THE PRESIDENT
TO MAKE SOME REMARKS AND TAKE 
SOME QUESTIONS. 
IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR OR SO. 
WE ARE GOING TO BRING THAT TO 
YOU LIVE. 
THIS DOCUMENT THAT WAS SIGNED 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM 
JONG-UN SAYS NORTH KOREA IS 
COMMITTED TO THE COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA BUT IT'S UNCLEAR 
EXACTLY WHAT THAT MEANS OR WHAT 
THE PROCESS WOULD LOOK LIKE. 
NORTH KOREA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE 
100 SITES THAT COULD DEVELOP 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
EARLIER ELAINE QUIJANO SPOKE 
WITH DARRELL KIMBALL, EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR OF THE ARMS CONTROL 
ASSOCIATION. 
>> WHAT WOULD IT MEAN FOR THE 
PENINSULA TO COMPLETELY AND 
IRREVERSIBLY DENUCLEARIZE? 
>> THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR 
UNDERTAKING BECAUSE NORTH KOREA 
HAS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY 
HAVE HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS, 
THEY'VE GOT DOZENS OF 
FACILITIES, THEY HAVE SOME TEN 
TO 16 NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
THEY HAVE ELASTIC MISSILES THAT 
CAN DELIVER THOSE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, THEY HAVE RESEARCH 
FACILITIES, TESTING FACILITIES, 
SO THIS IS A MAJOR UNDERTAKING 
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SEVERAL 
YEARS AT BEST. 
THIS SUMMIT COULD BE A START AT 
THAT PROCESS. 
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT NORTH 
KOREA HAS REACHED AGREEMENT 
WITH THE U.S. AND OTHER 
COUNTRIES TO DENUCLEARIZE IN 
THE PAST. 
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME WE 
ARE HEARING THIS TERM 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
IT GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO 
1992 WHEN NORTH AND SOUTH KOREA 
FIRST REACHED AGREEMENT ON A 
KOREAN PENINSULA 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO 
HERE IS TRYING TO CLARIFY, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT IS, TRYING 
TO CLARIFY, WHAT 
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS, TO MAKE 
SURE THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA 
HAVE THE SAME DEFINITION, THE 
SAME UNDERSTANDING OF THE STEPS 
NECESSARY AND THE SEQUENCE AND 
TIMING OF THOSE STEPS AND HOW 
WE ARE GOING TO VERIFY THIS 
COMPLEX PROCESS. 
>> YOU SAY THAT THE PROCESS 
ITSELF WOULD TAKE SEVERAL YEARS 
AT BEST. 
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE? 
>> I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT 
THIS IN PHASES. 
AS YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING, 
NORTH KOREA HAS TAKEN A COUPLE 
OF IMPORTANT CONFIDENCE 
BUILDING STEPS, THEY HAVE 
PLEDGED TO STOP BALLISTIC 
MISSILE FLIGHT TESTING, THEY 
HAVE BLOWN UP THE ENTRANCES TO 
THE TUNNELS AT THEIR NUCLEAR 
TEST SITE AND SAID THEY ARE 
GOING TO STOP NUCLEAR TESTING, 
THEY HAVE CONDUCTED SIX 
EXPLOSIONS IN THE PAST. 
THAT'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD. 
BUT THEY CONTINUE TO PRODUCE 
MATERIAL THAT'S HIGHLY ENRICHED 
URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM THAT YOU 
USE AS THE CORE MATERIAL FOR 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
THE FIRST STEP IS TO SOLIDIFY 
THE MISSILE FLIGHT TESTING 
FREEZE, THE NUCLEAR TEST 
STOPPAGE, AND NEED TO SEE THE 
NORTH KOREANS STOP PRODUCTION 
OF ENRICHED URANIUM AND 
PLUTONIUM. 
THAT WILL PROVIDE FOR TIME, THE 
TIME NECESSARY TO BEGIN THE 
COMPLEX PROCESS OF DISMANTLING 
AND DISABLING THE NUCLEAR INFO 
STRUCTURE AND IDENTIFYING WHERE 
THE SITES ARE, BEGINNING TO 
REMOVE THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN A 
SAFE MANNER. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 
THE NORTH KOREANS SEE 
DENUCLEARIZATION AS A PROCESS OF
-- THAT INVOLVES ACTION FOR 
ACTION STEPS. 
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE NOT GOING 
TO MOVE ALONG DOWN THE ROAD 
TOWARDS COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION UNLESS THEY 
RECEIVE ASSURANCES THAT THEIR 
REGIME WILL REMAIN INTACT. 
THEY NEED SECURITY GUARANTEES, 
THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE AND BE 
SAFE AND SECURE WITHOUT THEIR 
ARSENAL. 
SO THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN A STEPWISE FASHION, 
ACTION FOR ACTION, STEPS. 
THE OTHER QUESTION OF COURSE 
IS, HOW QUICKLY THIS TAKES 
PLACE. 
I BELIEVE THAT WHAT WE ARE 
GOING TO SEE IS A 
SOLIDIFICATION OF THE NUCLEAR 
TESTING AND BALLISTIC MISSILE 
TEST FREEZE, A STOPPAGE OF 
MATERIAL PRODUCTION IN THE 
FIRST FEW MONTHS, MAYBE BY NEXT 
YEAR, IF WE ARE LUCKY. 
GET INTO THE PROCESS OF 
VISITING SITES, IDENTIFYING 
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS HAVE, SO 
THE PROCESS OF DISMANTLEMENT 
AND DESTRUCTION CAN BEGIN. 
>> GIVEN THOSE STEPS, HOW 
LIKELY IS IT THAT THE U.S. AND 
NORTH KOREA HAVE DIFFERENT 
DEFINITIONS OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION? 
>> UP TO THIS POINT, THEY HAVE 
HAD DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS AND 
THIS HAS BEEN A MAJOR STICKING 
POINT ACCORDING TO PRESS 
REPORTS OUT OF SINGAPORE. 
IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO 
TOMORROW'S OR I SHOULD SAY 
TONIGHT'S MEETING. 
SO FROM THE U.S. PERSPECTIVE, 
DENUCLEARIZATION INVOLVES A 
COMPLETE REMOVAL OF ALL NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, THE DISMANTLEMENT OF 
THE FACILITIES, THE NUCLEAR 
MATERIAL, OVER A PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
THE NORTH KOREANS SEE 
DENUCLEARIZATION AS THE REMOVAL 
OF U.S. STRATEGIC ASSETS FROM 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
WHAT THAT MEANS IS THE REMOVAL 
OF ANY U.S. MILITARY FORCES 
THAT CAN CARRY NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
OR THAT CAN STRIKE NORTH KOREA 
AND HIT REGIME TARGETS IN A 
DECAPITATION STRIKE FOR 
INSTANCE. 
THAT MEANS NO B-1 BOMBERS, NO 
NUCLEAR POWERED AIRCRAFT 
CARRIERS, SHOULD BE IN THE 
REGION OR SHOULD BE PART OF 
JOINT U.S./SOUTH KOREAN 
MILITARY EXERCISES. 
THAT'S HOW THE NORTH KOREANS 
DEFINE IT AND THAT'S A STEP THE 
UNITED STATES CAN TAKE BECAUSE 
HAVING THOSE ASSETS IN THE 
REGION IS NOT NECESSARY TO 
PROTECT SOUTH KOREA IN CASE 
THERE IS A CONFLICT AT SOME 
POINT IN TIME. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FINANCIAL 
IMPACT, IS IT POSSIBLE TO PUT A 
NUMBER ON HOW MUCH IT WOULD 
COST THE REGIME TO DENUCLEARIZE 
I -- AND WHO WOULD FOOT THE 
BILL FOR THAT? 
>> THAT'S A CRUCIAL QUESTION. 
I DOUBT THAT THE NORTH KOREANS 
ARE GOING TO BE AS -- ASKED TO 
FOOT THE BILL BECAUSE IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT THE STEPS THAT I 
WAS DESCRIBING, THIS IS AN 
OPERATION THAT WILL TAKE YEARS. 
SOME LARGE INDUSTRIAL 
FACILITIES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 
BE TAKEN DOWN, REACTORS ARE 
GOING TO HAVE TO BE 
DECOMMISSIONED. 
WE ARE TALKING BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS WHETHER IT GETS INTO 
THE TENS OF BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS, NOT CLEAR. 
BUT WHAT PROBABLY WOULD HAPPEN 
IF WE GET THAT FAR IS THAT 
SOUTH KOREA, UNITED STATES, 
PERHAPS CHINA, PERHAPS RUSSIA, 
OTHER COUNTRIES MIGHT ASSIST IN 
FOOTING THE BILL INVOLVED IN 
UNDERTAKING THESE OPERATIONS. 
BUT WOULD ALSO HAVE TO BE DONE 
WITH THE COOPERATION OF NORTH 
KOREAN ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS 
WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THESE 
SITES, THEY KNOW HOW THE 
WEAPONS WERE BUILT FOR 
INSTANCE, SO THERE'S GOING TO 
HAVE TO BE A COOPERATIVE 
úPROGR 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT 
HELPS UNDERTAKE THESE 
ACTIVITIES. 
THERE'S ALSO THE COST OF THE 
VERIFICATION AND OVERSIGHT PART 
OF THIS PROCESS. 
SO IF WE GET A DECLARATION FROM 
NORTH KOREA, OF WHERE THEIR 
SITES ARE, WHAT THEIR WEAPONS 
HOLDINGS ARE, HOW LARGE THEIR 
STOCKPILES ARE, THAT WILL ALLOW 
INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY 
AGENCY INSPECTORS TO COME IN, 
TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF THAT 
DECLARATION, THAT WILL COST 
MONEY, THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC 
ENERGY AGENCY IS FINANCED BY 
MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS 
INCLUDING THE U.S., THEY HAVE 
AN EXISTING BUDGET THAT CAN 
COVER THE COST BUT TO DO THIS 
OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS, THE 
IAEA WILL NEED EXTRA TENS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR 
TO UNDERTAKE THESE OPERATIONS. 
THE COMPREHENSIVE TREATY 
ORGANIZATION ALSO WILL HAVE A 
ROLE IN CONFIRMING THE SHUTDOWN 
OF THE NORTH KOREAN TEST SITE, 
AND MONITORING FOR NUCLEAR TEST 
EXPLOSIONS THAT WOULD VIOLATE 
NORTH KOREA'S PLEDGES. 
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE COSTS. 
HOW THE BILL IS PAID, THAT'S AN 
ISSUE FOR FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD 
BUT THERE ARE PRECEDENTS FOR 
DOING THAT, IN THE PAST WITH 
THE UNITED STATES AND RUSSIA 
AND THEY ARE DISARMAMENT 
PROCESS. 
>> A LOT OF OPEN QUESTIONS, 
DARRELL CAMPBELL, THANKS FOR 
YOUR INSIGHT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> ALL RIGHT. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK WHILE WE AWAIT REMARKS BY 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
CBS NEWS. 
ALWAYS ON. 
>>> NORTH KOREA BEST NOT MAKE 
ANY MORE THREATS TO THE UNITED 
STATES. 
THEY WILL BE MET WITH FIRE AND 
FURY LIKE THE WORLD HAS NEVER 
SEEN. 
>> ROCKET MAN IS ON A SUICIDE 
MISSION FOR HIMSELF. 
>> HE REALLY HAS BEEN VERY OPEN 
AND -- I THINK VERY HONORABLE 
FROM EVERYTHING WE ARE SEEING. 
>> IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE 
EXISTING SUMMIT COULD TAKE 
PLACE OR A SUMMIT AT SOME LATER 
DATE. 
>> THIS WAS A MEETING WHERE A 
LETTER WAS GIVEN TO ME BY KIM 
JONG-UN AND THAT LETTER WAS A 
VERY NICE LETTER. 
>> IF YOU INVITE HIM TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE OR THE UNITED 
STATES WOULDN'T BE HERE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE OR AT MAR-A-LAGO? 
>> MAYBE WE'LL START WITH THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
>> I FEEL CONFIDENT, I FEEL 
THAT KIM JONG-UN WANTS TO DO 
SOMETHING GREAT FOR HIS PEOPLE. 
AND HE HAS THAT OPPORTUNITY. 
AND HE WON'T HAVE THAT 
OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. 
>> I FEEL REALLY GREAT, WITH 
THE GREAT DISCUSSION, 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS, 
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. 
IT'S MY HONOR AND YOU WILL HAVE 
A TERRIFIC RELATIONSHIP, I HAVE 
NO DOUBT. 
>> I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY IT 
WORKED OUT FOR BOTH OF US FAR 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE 
EXPECTED. 
I THINK FOR BETTER -- I WATCHED 
THE VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS, FAR 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY EVEN 
PREDICTED. 
THIS IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE 
AND MORE AND MORE -- IT'S AN 
HONOR TO BE WITH YOU. 
VERY GREAT HONOR, THANK YOU TO 
ALL OF YOUR REPRESENTATIVES, 
VERY MUCH. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
YOU SAW THE GREATEST HITS OF 
THE PRESIDENT, STARTING WITH 
AUGUST OF 2017 WHERE HE 
THREATENED NORTH KOREA 
ESSENTIALLY WITH NUCLEAR 
ANNIHILATION, TO THE POINT 
WHERE WE ARE TODAY WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT IS SITTING DOWN IN A 
HISTORIC MEETING WITH THE NORTH 
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN, 
SAYING TO A RESPONSE TO A 
QUESTION ABOUT
WHETHER THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD 
BE DENUCLEARIZING SAYING THAT 
HE EXPECTS THE PROCESS WILL 
START VERY QUICKLY, VERY 
QUICKLY ABSOLUTELY, THE 
PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN 
SIGNING WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
CALLED A TOM BRANT OF DOCUMENT, 
JOINT STATEMENT BETWEEN HIMSELF 
AND CHAIRMAN CHIEF -- CHAIRMAN 
KIM. 
IN THAT DOCUMENT, IT APPEARS 
THAT IT IS SIMILAR TO LANGUAGE 
USED BEFORE BY THE NORTH KOREANS
IN PROMISES THEY HAVE MADE TO 
THE UNITED STATES. 
THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING SET TO 
ADDRESS THIS DOCUMENT AND THE 
HISTORIC MEETING TO REPORTERS 
IN SINGAPORE, LOOKING AT A LIVE 
PICTURE RIGHT NOW OF THE 
BRIEFING ROOM WHERE THAT IS 
GOING TO HAPPEN AND OF COURSE 
THE PODIUM WITH THE GREAT SEAL, 
ON THAT PODIUM WHERE WE EXPECT 
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE TAKING 
QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS VERY 
SOON. 
WHILE WE AWAIT, LET'S BRING IN 
ISAAC STONE FISH, CBSN 
CONTRIBUTOR AND SENIOR FELLOW 
AT THE ASIA SOCIETY CENTER ON 
U.S./CHINA RELATIONS. 
WE ARE STARTING -- GETTING A 
MOMENT TO DIGEST THIS JOINT 
STATEMENT FROM THE PRESIDENT 
AND CHAIRMAN KIM, AND
YOU ARE THE EXPERT, I MEAN, 
SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF THE 
LANGUAGE HERE IS VERY VAGUE. 
TO BE FAIR TO THE PRESIDENT, 
THE FACT HE WAS ABLE TO SIT 
DOWN WITH CHAIRMAN KIM IS 
HISTORIC INN ITSELF, PERHAPS 
THIS IS A SIGN THINGS ARE GOING 
TO GET BETTER BETWEEN THE U.S. 
AND NORTH KOREA BUT IF HISTORY 
IS A GUIDE AND THIS LANGUAGE IS 
A GUIDE, GUARD POST, WHAT YOU 
MAKE OF IT? 
>> ON THE ONE HAND, ONE MAJOR 
PROBLEM THE U.S. AND NORTH 
KOREA HAVE HAD IS A LACK OF 
TRUST. 
IF THIS MEETING REALLY BUILD 
TRUST, THAT IS CERTAINLY A BOON 
TO THE PRESIDENT AND SOMETHING 
WE SHOULD COMMEND HIM FOR. 
I THINK WHAT'S PROBLEMATIC 
ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE 
PRESIDENT TRIED TO PLAY IT OFF 
AS SOMETHING THAT WENT BETTER 
THAN ANYONE EXPECTED AND USED A 
LOT OF GRAND FLOWERY LANGUAGE 
TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING THAT WE 
HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH. 
THIS IS NOT NEW TO AMERICANS, 
THIS IS NOT NEW TO THE NORTH 
KOREANS, SIMILAR TO A DOCUMENT 
THAT CAME OUT IN 1993. 
WE SEEM TO BE BUYING THE SAME 
HORSE THREE TIMES. 
>> I'VE SEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
PEOPLE ARE -- PEOPLE WHO ARE 
SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ARE POINTING OUT THE UNITED 
STATES AND THE DPR COMMIT TO 
RECOVERING REMAINS INCLUDING 
THE IMMEDIATE REPATRIATION OF 
THOSE ALREADY IDENTIFIED. 
HAS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE? 
>> I BELIEVE THAT HAS HAPPENED 
BEFORE. 
>> THAT'S NUMBER FOUR. 
IT SAYS REAFFIRMING THE APRIL 27
DECLARATION, THE DPRK COMMITS 
TO WORK TOWARD COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE 
PENINSULA AND THE PRESIDENT WAS 
ASKED ABOUT THAT, HE SAID IT'S 
GOING TO -- HE'S GOING TO START 
THE PROCESS, IT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN QUICKLY, IT SAYS HERE 
THE DPRK COMMITS TO WORK TOWARD 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION. 
WHEN YOU READ THAT, WHAT DOES 
THAT SAY TO YOU? 
>> THERE'S A LOT GOING ON 
BETWEEN DENUCLEARIZATION AND 
THE DPRK GETTING THERE. 
THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT LINE 
IS THAT THIS IS NOT COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH 
KOREA. 
THIS IS OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THE 
NORTH KOREANS COULD BE SAYING 
WE ARE NOT GOING TO REMOVE OUR 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNTIL THE U.S. 
GETS RID OF ITS NUCLEAR 
UMBRELLA OVER SOUTH KOREA, 
UNTIL THE U.S. REMOVES TROOPS 
OR STOPS FLYING BOMBERS OR STOP 
DOING JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES. 
AMAZING AMOUNT OF WIGGLE ROOM. 
>> THE SECOND POINT THAT IS 
MADE ON THIS JOINT STATEMENT IS 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE DPRK 
WILL JOIN THEIR EFFORTS TO 
BUILD A LASTING AND STABLE 
PEACE REGIME ON THE PENINSULA. 
>> WHAT THAT MEANS, YOUR GUESS 
IS AS GOOD AS MINE AND THAT'S A 
LOT OF WORDS SEWN TOGETHER IN 
AN OPTIMISTIC BOW. 
I DON'T THINK IT REALLY 
SIGNIFIES ANYTHING AT ALL. 
>> THE FIRST THING IN HIS JOINT 
STATEMENT IS THE UNITED STATES 
AND DPRK COMMIT TO ESTABLISH A 
NEW RELATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH 
THE DESIRE OF THE PEOPLE'S OF 
THE TWO COUNTRIES FOR PEACE AND 
PROSPERITY. 
>> SOUNDS NICE. 
I MEAN, I LIKE THE MELODY OF 
THAT SENTENCE. 
I THINK IF THEY WANTED TO SHOW 
THAT SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT, 
THEY COULD'VE SPOKEN ABOUT 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIPS OR 
INTENTIONS TO ESTABLISH 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. 
THIS IS JUST VERY, VERY VAGUE, 
VERY BOILERPLATE. 
>> YET AS YOU POINT OUT, IF 
CHAIRMAN KIM FEELS COMFORTABLE 
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, IT'S 
INTERESTING, I HAVE INTERVIEWED 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWICE AND THIS 
WAS BEFORE HE WAS PRESIDENT BUT 
RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT HE 
ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY, AS 
MANY HAVE NOTED, HE IS VERY 
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU ARE FACE-TO-
FACE AND HAVING A DISCUSSION 
WITH HIM THAN HE IS GENERALLY 
IN FRONT OF A CROWD OR IN FRONT 
OF A CAMERA. 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE WILL 
SAY TO YOU, THERE'S A REASON 
WHY PEOPLE TAKE TO HIM. 
HE IS CHARISMATIC, ENGAGING, HE 
DRAWS YOU INTO THE CONVERSATION 
AND SO IF CHAIRMAN KIM FEELS AS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SUGGESTED THAT 
HE MIGHT FEEL WITH -- WITHIN A 
MEETING -- WITHIN A MINUTE, 
COULD THAT GO A LONG WAY IN AT 
LEAST ALLOWING SOME OF THESE 
IMPORTANT NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE 
GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE LEVELS 
BELOW THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE 
PLACE AND SOMETHING CONCRETE 
ULTIMATELY COMING FROM THIS? 
>> CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. 
WHAT I AM PUSHING AGAINST AND 
WHAT IS FRUSTRATING IS THE WAY 
THAT TRUMP SPOKE ABOUT WHAT WAS 
GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS 
MEETING DURING THE MEETING. 
THIS WENT BETTER THAN ANYONE 
COULD'VE EXPECTED. 
AND THEN SAYING THAT AND HAVING 
THIS VERY BOILERPLATE STATEMENT 
COMING OUT OF THAT. 
SO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT 
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A MUCH 
BETTER AND HEALTHIER 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED 
STATES AND NORTH KOREA, BUT 
IT'S HARD TO KNOW BECAUSE OUR 
EXPECTATIONS HAVE BEEN SO 
MANIPULATED. 
>> AND YOU LOOK IN THIS 
DOCUMENT, THE DOCUMENT SAYS 
HAVING ACKNOWLEDGED THE U.S. 
DPRK SUMMIT, THE FIRST IN 
HISTORY, WAS OF GREAT 
SIGNIFICANCE IN OVERCOMING 
DECADES OF TENSIONS AND 
HOSTILITIES BETWEEN THE TWO AND 
FOR OPENING UP A NEW FUTURE, 
THAT COULD BE PART OF WHAT 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS 
THE PRESIDENT -- BECAUSE WE HAVE
HEARD FROM OTHER ANALYSTS SAYING
NORTH KOREANS HAVE ALWAYS 
WANTED THIS, THIS MEETING, NOW 
THAT THEY HAVE IT, IT IS 
INCUMBENT ON THEM TO DELIVER ON 
SOME OF THE THINGS THE UNITED 
STATES IS EXPECTING ON THE 
OTHER HAND. 
THERE WILL BE CRITICS WHO SAY 
BY GRANTING THIS MEETING, 
PROVIDING HIM THIS LEGITIMACY, 
THAT'S ALREADY A WIN FOR THE 
NORTH KOREANS AND THEY DON'T 
HAVE TO DO ANYTHING BECAUSE 
THEY'VE ALREADY GOT THIS VIDEO 
AND THEY CAN PLAY THAT OVER AND 
OVER AGAIN OF CHAIRMAN KIM 
MEETING WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 
KIM SAYING TO HIS PEOPLE IT'S 
BECAUSE WE ARE A NUCLEAR NATION 
THAT WE GOT THE SEAT AT THE 
TABLE. 
>> TRUMP SAID THAT KIM JONG-UN 
WAS A VERY SMART NEGOTIATOR. 
PRAISED HIS ABILITY. 
AND I THINK TRUMP IS RIGHT ON 
THAT BECAUSE IT REALLY DOES 
SEEM WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW THAT
KIM JONG-UN GOT THE UPPER HAND. 
>> LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 
WHILE WE AWAIT REMARKS BY THE 
PRESIDENT, LOOKING AT A LIVE 
PICTURE FROM SINGAPORE. 
WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
CBS NEWS. 
ALWAYS ON. 
>>>  HI, EVERYONE, I'M VLADAMIR 
DUTHIERS. 
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. 
IT IS ABOUT 4:00 P.M. 
IN SINGAPORE, 4:00 A.M. 
HERE ON THE EAST COAST. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN 
HAVE WRAPPED UP THEIR HISTORIC 
SUMMIT. 
ANY MOMENT NOW THE PRESIDENT 
WILL SPEAK ABOUT HIS MEETINGS 
WITH THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR 
AND THEIR IMPROMPTUDOCUMENT 
SIGNING. 
THE DOCUMENT CLAIMS BOTH SIDES 
WILL COOPERATE TO ACHIEVE 
PEACE. 
THE SUMMIT UNFOLDED ABOUT SEVEN 
HOURS AGO AND THE PAIR SHOOK 
HANDS AT THE HOTEL ON SENTOSA 
ISLAND IN A BACKDROP OF 
AMERICAN AND NORTH KOREAN 
FLAGS. 
A MOMENT AGO WE HEARD FROM THEM 
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. 
>> I FEEL REALLY GREAT. 
I FEEL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
GREAT DISCUSSION AND TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS, WE'VE BEEN 
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL. 
>> SO AT THAT FIRST MEETING THE 
PRESIDENT GOING ON TO SAY THAT 
HE THINKS THAT THEY WILL HAVE, 
QUOTE, A TERRIFIC RELATIONSHIP. 
KIM JONG-UN SAID, QUOTE, IT WAS 
NOT EASY TO GET HERE. 
THEY WENT ON TO HOLD A ONE-ON-
ONE MEETING AND A WORKING LUNCH 
WITH THEIR TOP ADVISERS. 
THE PAIR THEN WALKED OUTSIDE 
THE CAPELLA HOTEL AND PRESIDENT 
TRUMP BRIEFLY SPOKE TO 
REPORTERS. 
TAKE A LISTEN. 
>> IT'S GOING GREAT. 
WE HAD A REALLY FANTASTIC 
MEETING, A LOT OF PROGRESS, 
REALLY VERY POSITIVE, I THINK 
BETTER THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE 
EXPECTED, TOP OF THE LINE, 
REALLY GOOD. 
WE'RE GOING RIGHT NOW FOR A 
SIGNING. 
>>REPORTER:  WHAT ARE YOU GOING 
TO SIGN? 
>> SO THAT MOMENT RIGHT THERE 
WHEN THE PRESIDENT SAID WE'RE 
GOING FOR A SIGNING, HINTED AT 
AN UNSCHEDULED SIGNING, AND 
JUST AFTER 1:30 LOCAL TIME WE 
LEARNED WHAT HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT. 
THE DOCUMENT MR. TRUMP AND KIM 
SIGNED LISTS FOUR PROVISIONS, 
INCLUDING REAFFIRMING NORTH 
KOREA'S COMMITMENT OF WORKING 
DOORDZ COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE 
PENINSULA. 
HERE'S WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID BEFORE KIM JONG-UN LEFT 
THE SUMMIT. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 
WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST 
ABOUT KIM? 
>> GREAT PERSONALITY AND VERY 
SMART. 
GOOD COMBINATION. 
>>REPORTER:  IS HE WORTHY OF 
NEGOTIATING? 
>> HE'S A WORTHY NEGOTIATOR, 
NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF HIS 
PEOPLE, A VERY WORTHY, A VERY 
SMART NEGOTIATOR, ABSOLUTELY. 
AND WE HAD A TERRIFIC DAY, AND 
WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT EACH 
OTHER AND ABOUT OUR COUNTRIES. 
>>REPORTER:  WHAT DID YOU LEARN 
ABOUT HIM?
WHAT DID YOU LEARN ABOUT HIM, 
SIR? 
>> I LEARNED HE'S A VERY 
TALENTED MAN. 
I ALSO LEARNED THAT HE LOVES 
HIS COUNTRY VERY MUCH. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
CBS NEWS POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT ED O'KEEFE IS 
JOINING ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON. 
SO, ED, FIRST IMPRESSIONS AFTER 
YOU GOT A PEEK AT THIS JOINT 
STATEMENT BETWEEN PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM. 
AFTER THE PRESIDENT CALLED  IT 
A COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, 
SUGGESTING THAT 
DENUCLEARIZATION WOULD HAPPEN 
VERY, VERY QUICKLY, WHAT ARE 
YOUR THOUGHTS? 
>> MY FIRST THOUGHTS ARE HOW DO 
WE KNOW THAT AND HOW WILL WE 
VERIFY THAT IT'S HAPPENED. 
LOOK, I THINK WE HAVE TO PAUSE 
AND APPRECIATE THE HISTORY OF 
WHAT'S TRANSPIRED HERE 
OVERNIGHT IN THE UNITED STATES 
AND THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN ASIA. 
WE'VE NOW SEEN AND HEARD 
CHAIRMAN KIM, MOST OF THE WORLD 
HAS SEEN AND HEARD CHAIRMAN KIM 
UNFILTERED FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
AND THESE TWO HAVE NOW SPENT A 
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IN 
EACH OTHER'S PRESENCE WHICH IN 
AND OF ITSELF IS HISTORIC. 
THIS DOCUMENT, IF IT EVER DOES 
PAN OUT IS ALSO HISTORIC, BUT 
WHAT EXACTLY IT MEAN, WHAT IS 
THE DEFINITION OF, AS THEY PUT 
IT, DENUCLEARIZATION ON THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA? 
HOW WILL WE AND THE REST OF THE 
WORLD KNOW THAT THIS HAS 
HAPPENED, AND WHAT OTHER STEPS 
HAVE TO BE TAKE TONE MAKE THAT 
HAPPEN? 
WHAT WILL THE DIPLOMACY LOOK 
LIKE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN? 
WHO WILL BE DOING THAT, HOW 
MUCH AND WHERE? 
A LOT OF QUESTIONS REMAIN. 
THE PRESIDENT CAN SAY THAT THIS 
IS GOING TO HAPPEN VERY SOON. 
THE PRESIDENT WILL BE ABLE TO 
TOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS AND 
THE FACT THAT HE IS NOW AND 
FOREVER THE FIRST U.S. 
PRESIDENT TO MEET WITH THE 
NORTH KOREAN LEADER. 
BUT, AGAIN, U.S. PRESIDENTS 
HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE AND 
THEY'VE BEEN DUPED, AND WE'LL 
SEE WHETHER OR NOT THIS ONE IS 
ANY DIFFERENT AND WHY THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION AT LEAST 
BELIEVES IT WOULD BE ANY 
DIFFERENT 
>> YEAH. 
I MEAN, ED, THAT'S A GREAT 
POINT. 
WE'RE GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY 
WATCHING TO SEE HOW QUICKLY 
SOME OF THESE NOTES AND THESE 
POINTS THAT ARE IN THIS 
DOCUMENT GET IMPLEMENTED. 
AND AS YOU POINT OUT, THE NORTH 
KOREANS HAVE SUGGESTED IN 
DOCUMENTS PRIOR TO THIS, PRIOR 
TO THIS HISTORIC MEETING 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM THAT THEY WOULD DO 
THE THINGS THAT ARE LISTED  IN 
THIS VERY DOCUMENT AS WELL. 
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR 
YOU, ED, IS SOME OF THE 
LANGUAGE PRESIDENT TRUMP USED 
IN DESCRIBING THE DICTATOR KIM 
JONG-UN, LANGUAGE THAT WAS VERY 
BECOMING OF CHAIRMAN KIM. 
HE CALLED HIM TERRIFIC. 
HE SAID HE WAS A WORTHY 
NEGOTIATOR, A VERY TAL EMENTED 
MAN WHO LOVES HIS COUNTRY. 
CONTRAST THAT WITH SOME OF THE 
LANGUAGE THE PRESIDENT HAS USED 
WITH SOME OF OUR CLOSEST 
ALLIES, SPECIFICALLY AS IT 
RELATES TO THE G7 SUMMIT THAT 
JUST TOOK PLACE THIS WEEKEND. 
>> RIGHT. 
AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN 
HERE IN WASHINGTON AND OTHER 
PARTS OF THE WORLD ABOUT HOW 
THAT ALL WENT, THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS TALKING TOUGH AND 
BEING A PIT PETULENT, PERHAPS 
WITH SOME OF OUR CLOSEST 
ALLIES, BUT NOW SHOWS UP UP 
FLATTERING THE NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER. 
THERE IS ONE STREAM OF THOUGHT 
HERE IN WASHINGTON THAT PERHAPS 
THE PRESIDENT DID WHAT HE DID 
AND SAID WHAT HE SAID ABOUT 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU AND OTHER 
LEADERS IN A BID TO SORT OF AT 
THE LAST SECOND SHOW CHAIRMAN 
KIM HOW SERIOUS HE WOULD BE 
ABOUT BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY 
HIMSELF, THAT HE NEEDED TO 
DEMONSTRATE SOME TOUGHNESS ON 
THE GLOBAL STAGE BEFORE HE GOT 
TO SINGAPORE, MAYBE THE MESSAGE 
WAS RECEIVED THAT WAY, BUT, 
LOOK, YOU KNOW, I THINK WE CAN 
TAKE SOME COMFORT PERHAPS IN 
THE FACT THAT THE MARKETS AT 
LEAST DIDN'T REACT ADVERSELY ON 
MONDAY AND DON'T APPEAR TO BE 
PREPARING TO DO THAT TODAY. 
YOU KNOW, THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC 
WORLD ORDER AT LEAST STILL 
APPEARS TO BE INTACT EVEN IF 
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION ARE GOING TO 
HAVE SOME CLEANUP TO DO WITH 
CANADA, WITH GERMANY, WITH THE 
U.K. 
AND OTHERS. 
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK THEY 
WILL BE JUST AS SKEPTICAL, OUR 
CLOSEST ALLIES ABOUT WHAT HAS 
TRANSPIRED TODAY AND ARE GOING 
TO WANT TO LEARN MORE AS WELL. 
BUT IF ALL THAT OVER THE 
WEEKEND WAS SOME TOUGH TALK 
AHEAD OF THIS AND THERE AREN'T 
ANY OTHER REPERCUSSIONS, THEN 
PERHAPS EVERYTHING WILL BE 
FINE. 
BUT IT IS A TELLING CONTRAST, 
AND ONE THAT'S CERTAINLY 
DISTURBING  TO A LOT OF THE 
PRESIDENT'S CRITICS THAT HE 
WOULD GET SO NASTY WITH OUR 
ALLIES AND THEN SHOW UP IN 
SINGAPORE AND SAY SUCH NICE 
THINGS AND REALLY ROLL OUT THE 
RED CARPET FOR WHAT MOST OF THE 
WORLD HISTORY AND CERTAINLY 
THROUGHOUT HIS REIGN IN THE 
LAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS HAS 
BEEN DESCRIBED AS A DESPOT. 
>> YEAH, ED, AND IN THE TIME 
YOU'VE BEEN COVERING 
WASHINGTON, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD 
A PRESIDENTIAL -- A MEMBER OF A 
PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION 
SAYING THAT THERE'S A SPECIAL 
PLACE IN HELL FOR THE LEADER OF 
ONE OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES? 
I MEAN, LANGUAGE LIKE THAT IS 
TYPICALLY USED FOR PEOPLE LIKE 
KIM JONG-UN AND BASHAR AL-ASSAD 
AND OTHER HORRIBLE LEADERS OF 
ROGUE REGIMES AND NOT ONE OF 
AMERICA'S OLDEST ALLIES, 
INCLUDING A PRIME MINISTER WHO 
-- AND PREVIOUS PRIME MINISTERS 
IN CANADA WHO HAVE SUPPORTED 
THE UNITED STATES' EFFORT, FOR 
EXAMPLE, IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON 
TERROR. 
>> EXACTLY. 
SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL WOULD BE 
RESERVED FOR THOSE GUYS AND NOT 
FOR THE CANADIAN PRIME 
MINISTER. 
AND WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT ON 
MONDAY AT LEAST THERE WERE 
OTHER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS WHO SUGGESTED THAT 
PETER NAVARRO, THE PRESIDENT'S 
TOP TRADE ENVOY WHO SAID THOSE 
THINGS ABOUT JUSTIN TRUDEAU, 
THOSE OTHER ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THEY 
WOULDN'T HAVE GONE THAT FAR AND 
THAT PERHAPS MR. NAVARRO, YOU 
KNOW -- WOULDN'T NECESSARILY 
FACE CONSEQUENCES, BUT ISN'T 
NECESSARILY SPEAKING ON BEHALF 
OF AN ADMINISTRATION THAT 
AGREES UNANIMOUSLY WITH WHAT HE 
SAID. 
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT 
NAVARRO HAS NOT BEEN HELD IN 
HIGHEST REGARD BY THE PRESIDENT 
AND BY OTHER OFFICIALS AS WELL, 
AND HAS BEEN KNOWTO SAY THE 
KINDS OF THINGS THAT HE SAID 
OVER THE WEEKEND. 
BUT OBVIOUSLY THEY COULD BE 
CAUSING GREAT HEADACHES FOR A 
LOT OF OUR ALLIES. 
AND WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT 
THAT THE PEOPLE LIKE NAVARRO 
ARE NOT INVOLVED WITH WHAT'S 
TRANSPIRED TODAY IN SINGAPORE, 
THAT THIS HAS BEEN DRIVEN SO 
MUCH MORE BY THE SECRETARY OF 
STATE, BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISER, BY THE CHIEF OF STAFF 
WHO ARE ALL THERE WITH THE 
PRESIDENT AND SEEM TO HAVE A 
BETTER SENSE AND A TIGHTER 
CONTROL OVER WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS DOING AND SAYING AT THIS 
HOUR THERE IN ASIA. 
>> ED, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
IF YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR SCREEN 
RIGHT NOW, WE ARE LOOKING AT A 
HIGHLY-PRODUCED VIDEO HERE, 
BASICALLY LOOKS LIKE A 
PROPAGANDA VIDEO. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY 
SOUND. 
I'LL ASK THE CONTROL ROOM IF 
THERE'S ANY SOUND, BUT WHAT 
REPORTERS ARE BEING -- OR ARE 
WITNESSING RIGHT NOW -- LET'S 
WATCH THIS. 
THIS IS INCREDIBLE. 
 
 [ SPEAKING 
FOREIGN LANGUAGE  ] 
>> THIS IS OBVIOUSLY IN KOREAN, 
BUT YOU'RE SEEING -- AT LEAST 
THE INITIAL IMAGES OF KIM JONG-
UN SORT OF GREETING PEOPLE 
WITHIN HIS COUNTRY, I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS. 
ISAAC STONE FISH IS JOINING ME. 
HE'S AN ANALYST WHO'S BEEN 
COVERING THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT 
WITH ME FOR THE LAST SIX HOURS 
OR SO. 
ISAAC, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THIS? 
>> CERTAINLY VERY STRIKING THAT 
THE NORTH KOREANS WERE ABLE TO 
GET THIS VIDEO SHOWN, AND WHAT 
IT SEEMS TO BE SAYING IS THE 
KOREAN WAR WAS DEVASTATING FOR 
NORTH KOREA AND THE NORTH 
KOREAN PEOPLE FACED A LOT OF 
HARDSHIPS OVER THE DECADES, BUT 
UNDER THE WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP 
OF KIM JONG-UN THEY'VE MANAGED 
TO DEVELOP THEIR ECONOMY, 
THEY'VE MANAGED TO BRING 
THEMSELVES INTO A PRIDEFUL 
PLACE IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY. 
I DON'T SPEAK ANY KOREAN. 
I'D LOVE TO KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY 
THEY'RE SAYING IN THE VIDEO, 
BUT IT'S JUST SUCH A STRIKING 
SERIES OF IMAGES TO SEE THE 
AMERICAN AND GLOBAL PRESS CORPS 
TO SIT THERE AND WATCH AS WE 
WAIT FOR DONALD TRUMP TO COME 
OUT. 
IT'S ONE OF THE MOST SURREAL 
IMAGES WE'VE SEEN IN A VERY 
SURREAL DAY. 
>> I MEAN, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NO 
IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO PLAY OUT 
NEXT, BUT THE IDEA THAT AN 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, 
HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE 
FLATTERED IN THIS VIDEO, AS 
YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE IMAGES 
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THAT 
VIDEO, BUT FOR AN AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT TO COME OUT TO A 
VIDEO LIKE THIS, WHICH IS 
BASICALLY ESSENTIALLY VETTING 
THE LEADERSHIP OF KIM JONG-UN, 
ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL 
DICTATORS IN THE HISTORY OF THE 
WORLD, INCLUDING THE ENTIRE KIM 
FAMILY, HIS FATHER AND 
GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM IS 
REMARKABLE INDEED. 
>> IT'S REALLY STRIKING. 
IT'S, AGAIN, ONE OF THOSE -- I 
FEEL THAT KIND OF SPEECHLESS 
WHERE I JUST WANT TO TRY TO 
TALK AND EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING 
ON HERE. 
IT'S REALLY, REALLY BIZARRE. 
AND ONE IMAGINES THAT AS PART 
OF THE NEGOTIATING, OKAY, KIM 
JONG-UN IS NOT GOING TO SHOW UP 
FOR THE PRESS CONFERENCE 
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE 
TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF 
THE AWFUL THINGS HE'S DONE AND 
JUST FRANKLY PROBABLY DOESN'T 
WANT TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AT 
ALL, AND INSTEAD THE NORTH 
KOREANS GET TO SHOW THIS VIDEO. 
>> AND THEY'RE REPLAYING IT. 
>> THEY'RE REPLAYING IT. 
>> YEAH. 
>> THEY'RE SHOWING PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AT THE UNITED NATIONS 
WHERE HE MADE THE COMMENTS TO 
LITTLE ROCKET MAN, AND THEN YOU 
SAW AN IMAGE OF CHAIRMAN KIM. 
OH, THEY'RE PLAYING IT IN 
ENGLISH. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> RELATIVE PEACE AND TIMES OF 
GREAT TENSION. 
WHILE THIS CYCLE REPEATS, THE 
LIGHT OF PROSPERITY AND 
INNOVATION HAS BURNED BRIGHT 
FOR MOST OF THE WORLD. 
HISTORY IS ALWAYS EVOLVING, AND 
THERE COMES A TIME WHEN ONLY A 
FEW ARE CALLED UPON TO MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE. 
BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT 
DIFFERENCE WILL THE FEW MAKE? 
THE PAST DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE 
FUTURE. 
OUT OF THE DARKNESS CAN COME 
THE LIGHT, AND THE LIGHT OF 
HOPE CAN BURN BRIGHT. 
WHAT IF A PEOPLE THAT SHARE A 
COMMON AND RICH HERITAGE CAN 
FIND A COMMON FUTURE? 
THEIR STORY IS WELL KNOWN, BUT 
WHAT WILL BE THEIR SEQUEL? 
DESTINY PICTURES PRESENTS A 
STORY OF OPPORTUNITY, A NEW 
STORY, A NEW BEGINNING, ONE OF 
PEACE, TWO MEN, TWO LEADERS, 
ONE DESTINY, A STORY ABOUT A 
SPECIAL MOMENT IN TIME WHEN A 
MAN IS PRESENTED WITH ONE 
CHANCE THAT MAY NEVER BE 
REPEATED. 
WHAT WILL HE CHOOSE? 
TO SHOW VISION AND LEADERSHIP? 
OR NOT? 
THERE CAN ONLY BE TWO RESULTS, 
ONE OF MOVING BACK. 
  
>> OR ONE OF MOVING FORWARD. 
>> A NEW WORLD CAN BEGIN TODAY, 
ONE OF FRIENDSHIP, RESPECT AND 
GOOD WILL. 
BE PART OF THAT WORLD WHERE THE 
DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY ARE READY 
TO BE OPENED, INVESTMENT FROM 
AROUND THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN 
HAVE MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGHS, AN 
ABUNDANCE OF RESOURCES, 
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND NEW 
DISCOVERIES. 
WHAT IF? 
CAN HISTORY BE CHANGED? 
WILL THE WORLD EMBRACE THIS 
CHANGE? 
AND WHEN COULD THIS MOMENT IN 
HISTORY BEGIN? 
IT COMES DOWN TO A CHOICE. 
ON THIS DAY, IN THIS TIME, AT 
THIS MOMENT, THE WORLD WILL BE 
WATCHING, LISTENING, 
ANTICIPATING, HOPING. 
WILL THIS LEADER CHOOSE TO 
ADVANCE HIS COUNTRY AND BE PART 
OF A NEW WORLD? 
BE THE HERO OF HIS PEOPLE? 
WILL HE SHAKE THE HAND OF PEACE 
AND ENJOY PROSPERITY LIKE HE 
HAS NEVER SEEN? 
A GREAT LIFE OR MORE ISOLATION? 
WHICH PATH WILL BE CHOAZEN? 
FEATURING PRESIDENT DONALD 
TRUMP AND CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN. 
>> THIS IS REMARKABLE. 
ISAAC, I'VE NEVER SEEN -- THIS 
IS UNLIKE ANYTHING I HAVE EVER 
SEEN BEFORE, BASICALLY A 
PROPAGADA VIDEO PRODUCED BY -- 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE NORTH 
KOREANS OR THE SOUTH KOREANS. 
LOOKS LIKE IT'S THE NORTH 
KOREANS BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT 
-- AND HERE COMES THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES AFTER THIS 
PROPAGANDA VIDEO PLAYED. 
LET'S WATCH THIS. 
 
>> WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY. 
APPRECIATE IT. 
WE'RE GETTING READY TO GO BACK. 
WE HAD A TREMENDOUS 24 HOURS, 
WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS THREE 
MONTHS, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THIS 
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE A 
WHILE. 
THAT WAS A TAPE THAT WE GAVE TO 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND HIS PEOPLE, 
HIS REPRESENTATIVES AND 
CAPTURES A LOT, CAPTURES WHAT 
COULD BE DONE, AND THAT'S A 
GREAT PLACE, HAS THE POTENTIAL 
TO BE AN INCREDIBLE PLACE 
BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA, IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT IT, AND CHINA, IT'S 
GOT TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL AND I 
THINK UNDERSTANDS THAT, AND HE 
WANTS TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. 
IT'S MY HONOR TODAY TO ADDRESS 
THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD 
FOLLOWING THIS VERY HISTORIC 
SUMMIT WITH CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-
UN OF NORTH KOREA, SPENT VERY 
INTENSIVE HOURS TOGETHER, AND I 
THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE GOTTEN 
THE SIGNED DOCUMENT, OR YOU 
WILL VERY SHORTLY. 
IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE. 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 
I STAND BEFORE YOU AS AN 
EMISSARY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
TO DELIVER A MESSAGE OF HOPE 
AND VISION AND A MESSAGE OF 
PEACE. 
LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING OUR 
INCREDIBLE HOSTS IN SINGAPORE, 
ESPECIALLY PRIME MINISTER LE, A 
FRIEND OF MINE. 
THIS IS A COUNTRY, OF PROFOUND 
GRACE AND BEAUTY, AND WE SEND 
OUR WARMEST WISHES TO EVERY 
CITIZEN OF SINGAPORE WHO REALLY 
MADE THIS VISIT SO IMPORTANT 
AND SO PLEASANT DESPITE ALL OF 
THE WORK AND ALL OF THE LONG 
HOURS. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT 
MOON OF SOUTH KOREA. 
HE'S WORKING HARD. 
IN FACT, I'LL BE SPEAKING TO 
HIM RIGHT AFTER WE'RE FINISHED. 
PRIME MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN, A 
FRIEND OF MINE, JUST LEFT OUR 
COUNTRY, AND HE WANTS WHAT'S 
RIGHT FOR JAPAN AND FOR THE 
WORLD. 
GOOD MAN. 
AND A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, 
PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA WHO HAS 
REALLY CLOSED UP THAT BORDER, 
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS SO OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT 
THAT'S OKAY. 
BUT HE REALLY HAS, AND HE'S A 
TERRIFIC PERSON AND A FRIEND OF 
MINE AND REALLY A GREAT LEADER 
OF HIS PEOPLE. 
I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR 
EFFORTS TO HELP US GET TO THIS 
VERY HISTORIC DAY. 
MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WANT TO 
THANK CHAIRMAN KIM FOR TAKING 
THE FIRST BOLD STEP TOWARD A 
BRIGHT NEW FUTURE FOR HIS 
PEOPLE, OUR UNPRECEDENTED 
MEETING, THE FIRST BETWEEN AN 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND A LEADER 
OF NORTH KOREA PROVES THAT REAL 
CHANGE IS INDEED POSSIBLE. 
MY MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 
WAS HONEST, DIRECT AND 
PRODUCTIVE. 
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 
IN A VERY CONFINED PERIOD OF 
TIME, UNDER VERY STRONG, STRONG 
CIRCUMSTANCE. 
WE'RE PREPARED TO START A NEW 
HISTORY, AND WE'RE READY TO 
WRITE A NEW CHAPTER BETWEEN OUR 
NATIONS. 
NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO, THINK OF 
THAT, 70 YEARS AGO AN EXTREMELY 
BLOODY CONFLICT RAVAGED THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA. 
COUNTLESS PEOPLE DIED IN THE 
CONFLICT, INCLUDING TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BRAVE AMERICANS, 
YET WHILE THE ARMISTICE WAS 
AGREED TO, THE WAR NEVER ENDED 
TO THIS DAY, NEVER ENDED. 
BUT NOW WE CAN ALL HAVE HOPE 
THAT IT WILL SOON END, AND IT 
WILL, IT WILL SOON END. 
THE PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO 
DEFINE THE FUTURE. 
YESTERDAY'S CONFLICT DOES NOT 
HAVE TO BE TOMORROW'S WAR. 
AND AS HISTORY HAS PROVEN OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN, ADVERSARIES CAN 
INDEED BECOME FRIENDS. 
WE CAN HONOR THE SACRIFICE OF 
OUR FOREFATHERS BY REPLACING 
THE HORRORS OF BATTLE WITH THE 
BLESSINGS OF PEACE, AND THAT'S 
WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND THAT'S 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE. 
THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT NORTH 
KOREA CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IT GIVES 
UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 
EMBRACES COMMERCE, AN 
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE 
WORLD THAT REALLY WANTS TO 
ENGAGE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 
OPPORTUNITY LIKE NO OTHER TO BE 
REMEMBERED AS THE LEADER WHO 
USHERED IN A GLORIOUS NEW ERA 
OF SECURITY AND PROSPERITY FOR 
HIS PEOPLE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST SIGNED 
A JOINT STATEMENT IN WHICH HE 
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS 
NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE 
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, 
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT. 
THIS ISN'T THE PAST, THIS ISN'T 
ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION THAT 
NEVER GOT IT STARTED AND 
THEREFORE NEVER GOT IT DONE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TOLD ME THAT 
NORTH KOREA IS ALREADY 
DESTROYING A MAJOR MISSILE 
ENGINE TESTING SITE, THAT'S NOT 
IN YOUR SIGNED AGREEMENT, WE 
AGREED TO THAT AFTER THE 
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED. 
THAT'S A BIG THING FOR THE 
MISSILES THAT THEY WERE 
TESTING, SITE IS GOING TO BE 
DESTROYED VERY SOON. 
TODAY IS THE BEGINNING OF 
ANARDUOUS PROCESS, OUR EYES ARE 
WIDE OPEN, BUT PEACE IS ALWAYS 
WORTH THE EFFORT, ESPECIALLY IN 
THIS CASE. 
THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 
YEARS AGO, THIS SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN RESOLVED A LONG TIME AGO. 
BUT WE'RE RESOLVING IT NOW. 
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS THE CHANCE TO 
SEIZE AN INCREDIBLE FUTURE FOR 
HIS PEOPLE. 
ANYONE CAN MAKE WAR, BUT ONLY 
THE MOST COURAGEOUS CAN MAKE 
PEACE. 
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 
CANNOT ENDURE FOREVER, THE 
PEOPLE OF KOREA, NORTH AND 
SOUTH ARE PROFOUNDLY TALENTED, 
INDUS TREOUS AND GIFTED. 
THESE ARE TRULY GIFTED PEOPLE. 
THEY SHARE THE SAME HERITAGE, 
LANGUAGE, CULTURE, CUSTOMS AND 
DESTINY. 
BUT TO REALIZE THEIR AMAZING 
DESTINY, TO REUNITE THEIR 
NATIONAL FAMILY, THE MENACE OF 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL NOW BE 
REMOVED. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THE SANCTIONS 
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT. 
WE DREAM OF A FUTURE WHERE ALL 
KOREANS CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN 
HERMANY, WHERE FAMILIES ARE 
REUNITED AND HOPES ARE REBORN, 
AND WHERE THE LIGHT OF PEACE 
CHASES AWAY THE DARKNESS OF 
WAR, THIS BRIGHT FUTURE IS 
WITHIN IT AND THIS IS WHAT'S 
HAPPENING. 
IT IS RIGHT THERE, IT'S WITHIN 
OUR REACH. 
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE. 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 
PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS COULD NEVER 
TAKE PLACE. 
IT IS NOW TAKING PLACE. 
IT'S A VERY GREAT DAY, IT'S A 
VERY GREAT MOMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM IS ON HIS WAY BACK 
TO NORTH KOREA, AND I KNOW FOR 
A FACT AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES 
HE'S GOING TO START A PROCESS 
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE VERY HAPPY AND VERY 
SAFE. 
SO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH 
EVERYBODY TODAY, THE MEDIA. 
THIS IS A BIG GATHERING OF 
MEDIA, I WILL SAY. 
MAKES ME FEEL VERY 
UNCOMFORTABLE. 
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS 
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL 
OF US, INCLUDING YOURSELF AND 
YOUR FAMILIES. 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
BEING HERE. 
WE'LL TAKE SOME QUESTIONS. 
WOW! 
THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 
GO AHEAD. 
SURE. 
GO AHEAD. 
NBC. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU, IF YOU 
DON'T MIND. 
FIRST, THE MAN YOU MET TODAY, 
KIM JONG-UN, AS YOU KNOW HAS 
KILLED FAMILY MEMBERS, HAS úSTA 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF 
OTTO WARMBIER. 
WHY ARE YOU SO COMFORTABLE 
CALLING HIM VERY TALENTED? 
>> WELL, HE IS VERY TALENTED. 
ANYBODY THAT TAKES OVER A 
SITUATION LIKE HE DID AT 26 
YEARS OF AGE AND IS ABLE TO RUN 
IT AND RUN IT TOUGH, I DON'T 
SAY HE WAS NICE, OR I DON'T SAY 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT VERY FEW 
PEOPLE AT THAT AGE -- YOU COULD 
TAKE ONE OUT OF 10,000 PROBABLY 
COULDN'T DO IT. 
OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PERSON, AND HE WILL BE FOR A 
LONG TIME IN MY LIFE. 
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 
MINE. 
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 
DAY. 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH 
KOREA. 
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 
VAIN. 
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS. 
A SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 
HE A LOT TO DO WITH US BEING 
HERE TODAY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 
THAT SECOND QUESTION FOR YOU, 
SIR, IS ON THE SECURITY -- 
SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE 
SECURITY ASSURANCES YOU TALKED 
ABOUT IN YOUR STATEMENT. 
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 
ASSURANCES YOU ARE WILLING TO 
GIVE TO KIM JONG-UN? 
DOES THAT INCLUDE REDUCING 
MILITARY CAPABILITIES? 
AND JUST TO FL FOLLOW UP ON 
YOUR ANSWER -- 
>> NO, WE'RE NOT REDUCING 
ANYTHING. 
AT SOME POINT I HAVE TO BE 
HONEST AND I USED TO SAY THIS 
DURING MY CAMPAIGN, AS YOU KNOW 
PROBABLY BETTER THAN MOST, I 
WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS OUT. 
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 
BACK HOME. 
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 
THEM BACK HOME. 
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY, 
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD, BUT WE'LL 
BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 
OF MONEY, PLUS I THINK IT'S 
VERY PROVOCATIVE. 
YES, JOHN. 
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD. 
OH. 
GO AHEAD. 
I'M SORRY. 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOHN 
ROBERTS. 
I LOOKED AT YOU. 
YOU LOOK MUCH BETTER, RIGHT? 
>>REPORTER:  WE'RE FREQUENTLY 
CONFUSED, MR. PRESIDENT. 
MR. PRESIDENT, THIS JOINT 
STATEMENT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT 
VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
>> YEAH. 
>>REPORTER:  IS THAT A 
CONCESSION ON PART OF THE 
UNITED STATES? 
>> NO, NOT AT ALL. 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT SAID WE 
ARE GOING TO -- LET'S SEE HERE, 
IT WILL BE GONE -- I DON'T 
THINK YOU CAN BE ANY MORE PLAIN 
THAN WHAT WE'RE ASKING, ISSUES 
RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
THE NEW U.S. D.P.K.R. 
RELATIONS, THE BUILDING. 
WE TALK ABOUT THE GUARANTEES, 
AND WE TALK ABOUT UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO THE COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
THIS IS THE DOCUMENT THAT WE 
JUST SIGNED. 
>>REPORTER:  DID YOU DISCUSS 
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM METHODS TO 
VERIFY, EITHER WITH WITH THE 
UNITED STATES OR INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT VERY 
PROCESS? 
>> YES, WE DID. 
IT WILL BE -- WE'LL BE 
VERIFYING. 
>>REPORTER:  HOW IS THAT GOING 
TO BE ACHIEVED, MR. PRESIDENT? 
>> WELL, IT'S GOING TO BE 
ACHIEVE BID HAVING A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THERE. 
AND AS WE DEVELOP -- BE 
ACHIEVED BY HAVING A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THERE. 
AND AS WE DEVELOP THAT TRUST, 
SECRETARY POMPEO HAS REALLY 
BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, HIS 
STAFF, EVERYBODY. 
AS WE DO THAT, WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE. 
WHILE WE'RE THERE, WE'RE GOING 
TO BE WORKING ON A LOT OF OTHER 
THINGS, BUT THIS IS COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH 
KOREA, AND IT WILL BE VERIFIED. 
>>REPORTER:  WILL THOSE PEOPLE 
BE AMERICANS OR INTERNATIONAL 
-- 
>> COMBINATIONS OF BOTH. 
AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT. 
YEAH. 
GO AHEAD. 
BE NICE. 
BE RESPECTLEFUL. 
>>REPORTER:  I'LL BE VERY 
RESPECTFUL, SIR. 
WHAT DID KIM JONG-UN SAY TO YOU 
TO GIVE YOU THE CONFIDENCE THAT 
FOR ONCE IN THE HISTORY OF 
NORTH KOREA THEY ARE NOT 
CHEATING THE SYSTEM AND GAMING 
THE WORLD AND GAMING THE PEOPLE 
WHO WILL HAVE TO GO IN AND MAKE 
SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY 
GIVING UP THEIR NUCLEAR 
ARSENAL? 
>>REPORTER:  VERY FAIR 
QUESTION. 
HE ACTUALLY MENTIONED THE FACT 
THAT THEY PROCEEDED DOWN A PATH 
IN THE PAST AND ULTIMATELY, AS 
YOU KNOW, NOTHING GOT DONE. 
IN ONE CASE THEY TOOK BILLIONS 
OF DOLLARS DURING THE CLINTON 
REGIME, TOOK BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS AND NOTHING HAPPENED. 
THAT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. 
AND HE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT UP 
TO ME, AND HE SAID WE HAVE 
NEVER GONE THIS FAR, I DON'T 
THINK THEY'VE EVER HAD THE 
CONFIDENCE, FRANKLY, IN A 
PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE RIGHT 
NOW FOR GETTING THINGS DONE AND 
HAVING THE ABILITY TO GET 
THINGS DONE. 
AND HE WAS VERY FIRM IN THE 
FACT THAT HE WANTS TO DO THIS 
-- I THINK HE MIGHT WANT TO DO 
THIS AS MUCH OR EVEN MORE THAN 
ME BECAUSE THEY SEE A VERY 
BRIGHT FUTURE FOR NORTH KOREA. 
SO YOU NEVER KNOW, RIGHT? 
WE NEVER KNOW. 
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, WE SIGNED 
A VERY COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT 
TODAY, AND I THINK MOST OF YOU 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THAT DOCUMENT. 
BUT WE SIGNED A VERY, VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, AND I 
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO LIVE UP 
TO THAT DOCUMENT. 
IN FACT, WEN HE LANDS WHICH IS 
GOING TO BE SHORTLY, I THINK 
THAT HE WILL START THAT PROCESS 
RIGHT AWAY. 
I DO. 
I CAN ONLY SAY THAT I KNOW HIM 
FOR -- REALLY WELL, IT'S BEEN 
VERY RHETORICAL, AS YOU KNOW. 
I THINK WITHOUT THE RHETORIC IT 
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED. 
I THINK WITHOUT OTHER THINGS 
GOING ALONG, I THINK THE 
ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW TEAM WAS 
VERY IMPORTANT. 
WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM. 
BUT I DO, I THINK HE WANTS TO 
GET IT DONE. 
I REALLY FEEL THAT VERY 
STRONGLY. 
THERE'S JOHN. 
YOU KNOW, YOU TWO GUYS LOOK 
ALIKE WHEN THE LIGHT IS RIGHT. 
THE HAIR IS VERY SIMILAR. 
LET'S SEE. 
WHO HAS BETTER HAIR? 
HE HAS PRETTY GOOD HAIR, JOHN. 
>>REPORTER:  IT'S THE ANGELIC 
GLOW OF THE BACK LIGHTING, MR. 
PRESIDENT THAT MAKES US LOOK SO 
SIMILAR. 
OF COURSE THE DENUCLEARIZATION, 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND BIOLOGICAL 
WEAPONS AND WHATNOT IS ONE 
PROBLEM IN NORTH KOREA. 
ANOTHER HUGE PROBLEM IS THE 
HORRIBLE RECORD THAT THEY HAVE 
ON HUMAN RIGHTS. 
WAS THAT DISCUSSED AT ALL? 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL 
TACKLE IN THE FUTURE? 
>> YES, IT WAS DISCUSSED. 
IT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN THE 
FUTURE, HUMAN RIGHTS. 
WHAT WAS ALSO DISCUSSED IN 
GREAT DETAIL, JOHN, WAS THE 
FACT THAT, YOU KNOW -- AND I 
MUST HAVE HAD JUST COUNTLESS 
CALLS AND LETTERS AND PLEASE, 
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO, THEY WANT 
THE REMAINS OF THEIR SONS BACK. 
THEY WANT THE REMAINS OF THEIR 
FATHERS AND MOTHERS AND ALL OF 
THE PEOPLE THAT GOT CAUGHT IN 
THAT REALLY BRUTAL WAR WHICH 
TOOK PLACE TO A LARGE EXTENT IN 
NORTH KOREA, AND I ASKED FOR IT 
TODAY, AND WE GOT IT. 
THAT WAS A VERY LAST MINUTE, 
THE REMAINS WILL BE COMING 
BACK. 
THEY'RE GOING TO START THAT 
PROCESS IMMEDIATELY. 
BUT SO MANY PEOPLE, EVEN DURING 
THE CAMPAIGN, THEY'D SAY IS 
THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN WORK WITH 
NORTH KOREA TO GET THE REMAINS 
OF MY SON BACK OR MY FATHER 
BACK, SO MANY PEOPLE ASK ME 
THIS QUESTION. 
AND, YOU KNOW, I SAID, LOOK, WE 
DON'T GET ALONG TOO WELL WITH 
THAT PARTICULAR GROUP OF 
PEOPLE. 
BUT NOW WE DO. 
AND HE AGREED TO THAT SO 
QUICKLY AND SO NICE -- IT WAS 
REALLY A VERY NICE THING, AND 
HE UNDERSTANDS IT. 
HE UNDERSTANDS IT. 
SO FOR THE THOUSANDS AND 
THOUSANDS, I GUESS WAY OVER 
6,000 THAT WE KNOW OF IN TERMS 
OF THE REMAINS, THEY'LL BE 
BROUGHT BACK. 
>>REPORTER:  THE POW/MIA ISSUE 
IS CLEARLY A VERY IMPORTANT ONE 
TO THOUSANDS. 
>> ESPECIALLY TO A LOT OF 
PEOPLE. 
>>REPORTER:  BUT WHAT DO YOU, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, EXPECT KIM 
JONG-UN TO DO ABOUT THE HUMAN 
RIGHTS RECORD REGARDING THE 
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE? 
>> RIGHT. 
IT WAS DISCUSSED, IT WAS 
DISCUSSED RELATIVELY BRIEFLY 
COMPARED TO DENUCLEARIZATION, 
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHERE WE 
STARTED AND WHERE WE ENDED. 
BUT THEY WILL BE DOING THINGS, 
AND I THINK HE WANTS TO DO 
THINGS. 
I THINK HE WANTS TO. 
YOU'D BE VERY SURPRISED, VERY 
SMART, VERY GOOD NEGOTIATOR, 
WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. 
YOU KNOW, HE BROUGHT UP THE 
FACT THAT IN THE PAST THEY TOOK 
DIALOGUE -- THEY NEVER WERE 
LIKE WE ARE. 
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING 
LIKE WHAT'S TAKEN PLACE NOW. 
BUT THEY WENT DOWN THE LINE, 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE GIVEN, 
AND, YOU KNOW, THE FOLLOWING 
DAY THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM 
CONTINUED. 
BUT THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT 
TIME. 
AND THIS IS A MUCH DIFFERENT 
PRESIDENT IN ALL FAIRNESS. 
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. 
THIS WAS ONE OF THE -- PERHAPS 
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I WON 
-- I CAMPAIGNED ON THIS ISSUE, 
AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL, JOHN. 
OKAY. 
WHOEVER THOSE PEOPLE ARE, I 
CANNOT SEE YOU WITH ALL THE 
LIGHTS, BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE 
EITHER OF THE TWO -- GO AHEAD. 
SURE. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
AND FIRST OF ALL 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
APPRECIATE IT. 
>>REPORTER:  DID YOU TOUCH ON 
THE ISSUE OF PEACE TREATY, AND 
ALSO WILL YOU TRAVEL TO 
PYONGYANG ANYTIME SOON? 
>> WELL, AT A CERTAIN TIME I 
WILL. 
THAT WILL BE A DAY THAT I LOOK 
VERY MUCH FORWARD TO, AT THE 
APPROPRIATE TIME. 
AND I ALSO WILL BE INVITING 
CHAIRMAN KIM AT THE APPROPRIATE 
TIME TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
I THINK IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE 
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE VERY 
IMPORTANT, AND HE HAS ACCEPTED. 
I SAID AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. 
WE WANT TO GO A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD. 
BUT WHAT WE SIGNED TODAY WAS A 
LOT OF THINGS INCLUDED. 
AND THEN YOU HAVE THINGS THAT 
WEREN'T INCLUDED THAT WE GOT 
AFTER THE DEAL WAS SIGNED. 
I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE IN MY 
LIFE, AND WE DIDN'T PUT IT IN 
THE AGREEMENT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T 
HAVE TIME. 
AND I THINK MOST OF YOU HAVE 
BEEN HANDED OUT THE AGREEMENT 
OR SOON WILL. 
OH, YOU HAVE NOT? 
WELL, IF YOU COULD HAVE THOSE 
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT. 
WE JUST FINISHED THEM JUST A 
LITTLE WHILE AGO. 
BUT IF YOU COULD HAVE THE 
AGREEMENTS PASSED OUT, YOU'LL 
SEE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. 
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  CONGRATULATIONS, 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>REPORTER:  WHAT PART DID 
JAPAN PLAY, AND DID THE 
ABDUCTION ISSUE COME UP? 
>> YES. 
>>REPORTER:  AND ALSO THE FATE 
OF THE CHRISTIANS? 
AND ALSO, A FOLLOWUP QUESTION 
IS WHEN WILL YOU BE DOING AN 
INTERVIEW WITH JAPANESE TV? 
50,000 TROOPS ARE IN JAPAN. 
>> THAT'S TRUE. 
50,000 GREAT TROOPS, THAT'S 
TRUE. 
ABDUCTION, ABSOLUTELY. 
PRIME MINISTER ABE, ONE OF HIS 
CERTAINLY -- OTHER THAN THE 
WHOLE DENUKING SUBJECT, 
CERTAINLY HIS -- I WOULD SAY 
HIS MAIN POINT, AND I BROUGHT 
IT UP, ABSOLUTELY, AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE WORKING ON THAT. 
WE DIDN'T PUT IT DOWN IN THE 
DOCUMENT, BUT IT WILL BE WORKED 
ON. 
CHRISTIANS, YES, WE ARE -- 
BROUGHT IT UP, VERY STRONGLY. 
YOU KNOW, FRANKLIN GRAHAM SPENT 
AND SPENDS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 
OF TIME IN NORTH KOREA. 
HE'S GOT IT VERY CLOSE IT HIS 
HEART. 
IT DID COME UP AND THINGS WILL 
BE HAPPENING. 
THANK YOU. 
GREAT QUESTION. 
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU, JOHN. 
>>REPORTER:  RETURNING TO THE 
QUESTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS, YOU 
SPOKE VERY POWERFULLY ON THE 
ISSUE DURING YOUR STATE OF THE 
UNION ADDRESS. 
>> RIGHT. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU SHOWED THAT 
YOU HAD THE DEFACTOR IN THE 
FIRST LADY'S BOX WITH THE 
CRUTCHES WHO ESCAPED, AND YOU 
SAID THAT NORTH KOREA HAS MORE 
BRUTALLY OPPRESSED ITS PEOPLE 
THAN ANY OTHER REGIME ON EARTH. 
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT IS 
THE CASE HAVING SAT DOWN WITH 
KIM JONG-UN, AND DOES HE NEED 
TO CHANGE THAT? 
>> JOHN, I BELIEVE IT'S A ROUGH 
SITUATION OVER THERE, THERE'S 
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, AND WE 
DID DISCUSS IT TODAY PRETTY 
STRONGLY. 
I MEAN, KNOWING WHAT THE MAIN 
PURPOSE OF WHAT WE WERE DOING 
IS DENUKING, BUT DISCUSSED IT 
AT PRETTY GOOD LENGTH. 
WE'LL BE DOING SOMETHING ON IT. 
IT'S ROUGH. 
IT'S ROUGH IN A LOT OF PLACES, 
BY THE WAY, NOT JUST THERE, BUT 
IT'S ROUGH. 
AND WE WILL CONTINUE THAT, AND 
I THINK ULTIMATELY WE'LL AGREE 
TO SOMETHING. 
BUT IT WAS DISCUSSED AT LENGTH 
OUTSIDE OF THE NUCLEAR 
SITUATION, ONE OF THE PRIMARY 
TOPICS. 
>>REPORTER:  BUT DO YOU THINK 
THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE TO BRING 
ON THIS GLORIOUS NEW ERA YOU 
TALKED ABOUT? 
>> I THINK IT WILL CHANGE, 
YEAH. 
I THINK IT PROBABLY HAS TO, BUT 
I THINK IT PROBABLY WILL. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
STEVE. 
THAT'S YOU, STEVE, RIGHT THERE. 
>>REPORTER:  YES, SIR. 
THANK YOU. 
WHAT TIMETABLE DO YOU ENVISION 
FOR THE DENUCLEARIZATION, AND 
IN THE MEANTIME ARE YOU 
THINKING ABOUT EASING ANY 
SANCTION? 
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, 
SCIENTIFICALLY I'VE BEEN 
WATCHING AND READING A LOT 
ABOUT THIS, AND IT DOES TAKE A 
LONG TIME TO, YOU KNOW, PULL 
OFF COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION. 
IT TAKE AS LONG TIME 
SCIENTIFICALLY. 
YOU HAVE TO WAIT CERTAIN 
PERIODS OF TIME, AND A LOT OF 
THINGS HAPPEN. 
BUT DESPITE THAT, ONCE YOU 
START THE PROCESS, IT MEANS 
IT'S PRETTY MUCH OVER, CAN'T 
USE THEM. 
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 
AND THAT'S GOING TO START VERY 
SOON. 
I BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO START 
VERY SOON. 
WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS IT CAN 
MECHANICALLY AND PHYSICALLY BE 
DONE, STEVE. 
>>REPORTER:  AND THE SANCTIONS? 
>> THE SANCTIONS WILL COME OFF 
WHEN WE ARE SURE THAT THE NUKES 
ARE NO LONGER A FACTOR. 
SANCTIONS PLAYED A BIG ROLE, 
BUT THEY'LL COME OFF AT THAT 
POINT. 
I HOPE IT'S GOING TO BE SOON. 
BUT THEY'LL COME OFF. 
AS YOU KNOW, AND AS I'VE SAID, 
THE SANCTIONS RIGHT NOW REMAIN. 
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT -- I 
ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING 
THEM OFF, AND THEY'LL COME OFF 
WHEN WE KNOW WE ARE -- WHEN WE 
KNOW WHERE DOWN THE ROAD 
NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 
>> YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>REPORTER  CONGRATULATIONS ON 
THIS HISTORIC SUMMIT. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY, 
BY THE WAY. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU SIGNED A 
DOCUMENT WITH KIM JONG-UN. 
IT'S ESSENTIALLY A PIECE OF 
PAPER. 
YESTERDAY WE HAD A BRIEFING 
FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
MIKE POMPEO, AND HE SAID THE 
FOLLOWING, MANY PRESIDENTS 
PREVIOUSLY HAVE SIGNED OFF ON 
PIECES OF PAPER, ONLY TO FIND 
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS EITHER 
DIDN'T PROMISE WHAT WE THOUGHT 
THEY HAD OR ACTUALLY RENEGED ON 
THOSE PROMISES. 
WHAT MAKES THIS TIME DIFFERENT, 
MR. PRESIDENT? 
>> WELL, YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT 
ADMINISTRATION. 
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT PRESIDENT, 
YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT SECRETARY 
OF STATE. 
YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE, YOU 
KNOW, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO 
THEM, AND WE GET IT DONE. 
THE OTHER GROUPS, MAYBE IT 
WASN'T A PRIORITY. 
I DON'T THINK THEY COULD HAVE 
DONE IT IF IT WAS A PRIORITY, 
FRANKLY. 
I DON'T THINK THEY HONESTLY 
COULD HAVE DONE IT EVEN IF IT 
WAS A PRIORITY. 
AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER 
BACK THEN. 
FOR ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH 
EASIER IF THIS WERE 10 YEARS 
AGO OR FIVE YEARS AGO, AND I'M 
NOT JUST BLAMING PRESIDENT 
OBAMA. 
THIS GOES ACK FOR 25 YEARS 
THIS SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. 
I WAS GIVEN A VERY TOUGH HAND. 
I WAS GIVEN THIS, I WAS GIVEN 
THE IRAN DEAL, AND PLENTY OF 
OTHER PROBLEMS. 
BUT WE ARE -- WE'RE DOING 
REALLY WELL. 
AND THE IRAN DEAL, I HAVE TO BE 
HONEST, I DID IT BECAUSE 
NUCLEAR IS ALWAYS NUMBER ONE TO 
ME, NUCLEAR IS NUMBER ONE. 
BUT ON THE IRAN DEAL, I THINK 
IRAN IS A DIFFERENT COUNTRY NOW 
THAN IT WAS THREE OR FOUR 
MONTHS AGO. 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING 
SO MUCH TO THE MEDITERRANEAN. 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOOKING 
SO MUCH AT SYRIA LIKE THEY WERE 
WITH TOTAL CONFIDENCE. 
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE SO 
CONFIDENT RIGHT NOW. 
BUT I HOPE WITH -- WITH THAT 
BEING SAID, I HOPE THAT AT THE 
APPROPRIATE TIME AFTER THESE 
SANCTIONS KICK IN AND THEY ARE 
BRUTAL WHAT WE'VE PUT ON IRAN, 
I HOPE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 
COME BACK AND NEGOTIATE A REAL 
DEAL BECAUSE I'D LOVE TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THAT. 
BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S TOO SOON FOR 
THAT. 
YES. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, YOU 
ALSO TALKED ABOUT ESTABLISHING 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. 
>> YEAH. 
>>REPORTER:  EXCHANGING 
AMBASSADORS. 
HOW LONG BEFORE THAT HAPPENS? 
>> GOOD QUESTION. 
HOPEFULLY SOON, BUT WE'LL HAVE 
TO GET THINGS MOVING FIRST. 
A LITTLE BIT EARLY FOR THAT. 
WE HAVE TO GET THINGS MOVING. 
YES, GO AHEAD. 
HI. 
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU CLARIFY -- 
WHEN YOU SAID YOU'RE STOPPING 
WAR GAMES 
>> YEAH. 
>>REPORTER:  SO YOU ARE 
STOPPING THE MILITARY EXERCISES 
WITH SOUTH KOREA? 
>> WE'VE DONE EXERCISES FOR A 
LONG PERIOD OF TIME, WORKING 
WITH SOUTH KOREA, AND WE CALL 
THEM WAR GAMES, I CALL THEM WAR 
GAMES AND THEY'RE TREMENDOUSLY 
EXPENSIVE. 
THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE 
SPEND ON THAT IS INCREDIBLE, 
AND SOUTH KOREA CONTRIBUTES, 
BUT NOT 100% WHICH IS CERTAINY 
A SUBJECT WE HAVE TO TALK TO 
THEM ABOUT ALSO, AND THAT HAS 
TOO DO WITH THE MILITARY -- TO 
DO WITH THE MILITARY EXPENSE 
AND ALSO THE TRADE. 
SO WE'RE DOING THAT. 
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEW DEAL 
WITH SOUTH KOREA IN TERMS OF 
THE TRADE DEAL, BUT WE HAVE TO 
TALK TO THEM, WE HAVE TO TALK 
TO MANY COUNTRIES  ABOUT 
TREATING US FAIRLY. 
BUT THE WAR GAMES ARE VERY 
EXPENSIVE. 
WE PAY FOR A BIG MAJORITY OF 
THEM. 
WE FLY IN BOMBERS FROM GUAM. 
I SAID -- WHEN I FIRST STARTED, 
I SAID WHERE DO THE BOMBERS 
COME FROM? 
GUAM, NEARBY. 
I SAID, OH, GREAT, NEARBY. 
WHERE'S NEARBY? 
6 1/2 HOURS. 
6 1/2 HOURS, THAT'S A LONG TIME 
FOR THESE BIG MASSIVE PLANES TO 
BE FLYING TO SOUTH KOREA TO 
PRACTICE AND THEN DROP BOMBS 
ALL OVER THE PLACE AND THEN GO 
BACK TO GUAM. 
ILLINOIS HE A LOT ABOUT 
AIRPLANE -- I KNOW A LOT ABOUT 
AIRPLANES, IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE, 
AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT. 
AND WHAT I DID SAY IS -- AND I 
THINK IT'S VERY PROVOCATIVE, I 
HAVE TO TELL YOU, JENNIFER, 
IT'S A VERY PROVOCATIVE 
SITUATION. 
WHEN I SEE THAT AND YOU HAVE A 
COUNTRY RIGHT NEXT DOOR. 
SO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT 
WE'RE NEGOTIATING A VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETE DEAL, I 
THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE TO BE 
HAVING WAR GAMES. 
SO NUMBER ONE, WE SAVE MONEY, A 
LOT, AND, NUMBER TWO, IT REALLY 
IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK THEY 
VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. 
>>REPORTER:  DOES NORTH KOREA 
GIVE YOU SOMETHING IN RETURN, 
THOUGH? 
>> WELL, WE'VE GOTTEN -- I'VE 
HEARD THAT. 
SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT -- I 
DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THEY REALLY 
MEAN IT. 
I DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO GO 
AGAINST THE PRESS, I JUST 
DON'T, ESPECIALLY NOT TODAY, 
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT. 
BUT I NOTICE THAT SOME OF THE 
PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS AGREED TO MEET, 
HE HAS GIVEN UP SO MUCH. 
I GAVE UP NOTHING. 
I'M HERE. 
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN 25 HOURS, 
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS 
APPROPRIATE TO DO BECAUSE WE'VE 
BEEN NEGOTIATING FOR LITERALLY 
AROUND THE CLOCK WITH THEM AND 
WITH US AND WITH JOHN AND WITH 
MIKE AND A WHOLE TEAM OF VERY 
TALENTED PEOPLE. 
BUT WE HAVEN'T GIVEN UP 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN YOU'RE 
RIGHT, I AGREED TO MEET. 
AND I THINK THE MEETING WAS 
EVERY BIT AS GOOD FOR THE 
UNITED STATES AS IT WAS FOR 
NORTH KOREA. 
BUT I JUST WROTE DOWN SOME OF 
THE THINGS WE GOT, AND THEY -- 
YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD, THEY GOT 
A MEETING. 
BUT ONLY A PERSON THAT DISLIKES 
DONALD TRUMP WOULD SAY THAT 
I'VE AGREED TO MAKE A BIG 
COMMITMENT. 
SURE. 
I'VE AGREED TO TAKE A PERIOD OF 
TIME TO COME HERE AND MEET, AND 
THAT'S GOOD. 
BUT I THINK IT'S GREAT FOR US 
AS A COUNTRY, AND I THINK IT'S 
GOOD FOR THEM. 
BUT WHAT DID THEY DO TO JUSTIFY 
THIS MEETING? 
SECURED COMMITMENT FOR COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THAT'S THE BIG THING. 
THEY SECURED THE RELEASE OF 
THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES. 
THEY ALREADY GAVE THEM TO US 
TWO MONTHS AGO. 
THESE PEOPLE ARE NOW LIVING 
HAPPYILY BACK IN THEIR HOMES 
WITH -- HAPPILY BACK IN THEIR 
HOMES WITH THEIR FAMILIES, AND 
IT WAS PRETTY ROUGH FOR THEM, 
TO PUT IT MILDLY. 
SECURE THE COMMITMENT TO 
RECOVER THE REMAINS, INCLUDING 
THESE OF OUR FALLEN HEROS, AND 
THEY'RE GIVING A COMMITMENT, 
THEY'RE STARTING IT IMMEDIATELY 
TO RECOVER THE REMAINS. 
AND I JUST WENT THROUGH HOW 
MANY PEOPLE ASKED ME ABOUT IT. 
I WAS AMAZED, ACTUALLY. 
, SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME, 
IS IT POSSIBLE, IS IT POSSIBLE? 
AT THAT TIME WE HAD NO 
RELATIONSHIP TO CHAIRMAN KIM OR 
TO IT ANYBODY ELSE IN NORTH 
KOREA. 
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A VERY CLOSED 
SOCIETY. 
SO WE'RE GETTING THE REMAINS 
BACK, SECURED THE HALT OF ALL 
MISSILE AND NUCLEAR TESTS FOR 
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? 
SEVEN MONTHS YOU HAVEN'T HAD A 
MISSILE GO OFF. 
FOR SEVEN MONTHS YOU HAVEN'T 
HAD A NUCLEAR TEST, YOU HAVEN'T 
HAD A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION. 
I REMEMBER A NUCLEAR EVENT TOOK 
PLACE, 8.8 ON THE RICHTER 
SCALE, AND THEY ANNOUNCED, I 
HEARD IT ON THE RADIO, THEY 
ANNOUNCED THAT A MASSIVE, YOU 
KNOW, A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE TOOK 
PLACE SOMEWHERE IN ASIA, AND 
THEN THEY SAID IT WAS NORTH 
KOREA, AND THEN THEYFOUND OUT 
IT WAS A NUCLEAR TEST. 
I SAID I NEVER HEARD OF A 
RICHTER SKILL IN THE HIGH 8s. 
AND IF YOU LOOK, THERE HAS BEEN 
NO MISSILE LAUNCHES. 
THEY'VE BLOWN UP THEIR MISSILE 
AREA, THAT'S GOING TO TAKE 
PLACE. 
THAT HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN INTO 
THE CONTRACT. 
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE 
EXACT DETAILS ON THAT. 
BUT THEY SECURED THE HALT OF 
ALL MISSILES AND OF ALL NUCLEAR 
TESTS. 
THEY SECURED THE CLOSURE OF 
THEIR SINGLE PRIMARY NUCLEAR 
TEST FLIGHT, TEST SITE, ALL 
THREE OF THEM THERE IN AN AREA 
THAT'S COMMON AROUND EACH 
OTHER, THEY SECURED THE 
CLOSURE. 
THEY SECURED THE COMMITMENT TO 
DESTROY THE MISSILE ENGINE 
TESTING SITE. 
THAT WAS NOT IN YOUR AGREEMENT. 
I GOT THAT AFTER WE SIGNED THE 
AGREEMENT. 
I SAID, DO ME A FAVOR. 
YOU'VE GOT THIS MISSILE ENGINE 
TESTING SITE, WE KNOW WHERE IT 
IS BECAUSE OF THE HEAT, IT'S 
INCREDIBLE THE EQUIPMENT WE 
HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. 
I SAID CAN YOU CLOSE IT UP? 
YOU CAN CLOSE IT UP. 
WE MAINTAINED THE ABILITY TO 
CONTINUE TO APPLY SANCTIONS. 
SO WE'RE APPLYING SANCTIONS. 
NOW, I HAD 300 SANCTIONS THAT I 
WAS GETTING READY TO PUT ON 
LAST WEEK, AND I SAID, YOU 
KNOW, I CAN'T REALLY PUT ON 
SANCTIONS WHEN I'M MEETING. 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY 
DISRESPECTFUL, 300 VERY BIG 
ONES, POWERFUL ONES. 
AND I SAID IT WOULD BE 
DISRESPECTFUL. 
SO, JENNIFER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE 
GOT, AND WHEN WE GOT OUR 
HOSTAGES BACK, I DIDN'T PAY 
$1.8 BILLION IN CASH LIKE THE 
HOSTAGES THAT CAME BACK FROM 
IRAN WHICH WAS A DISGRACEFUL 
SITUATION WHAT TOOK PLACE. 
SO WE'VE GOTTEN A LOT. 
SO WHEN I HEAR SOMEBODY IN THE 
MEDIA SAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
HAS AGREED TO MEET, LIKE IT'S 
NOT A BIG DEAL TO MEET. 
I THINK WE SHOULD MEET ON A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT TOPIC, NOT JUST 
THIS ONE. 
AND I REALLY BELIEVE A LOT OF 
GREAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN. 
YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 
>>REPORTER:  SIR, YOU JUST 
LISTED OFF A LOT OF THINGS THAT 
YOU SAY YOU GOT IN THIS 
MEETING. 
IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO, THOUGH, 
THAT YOU SAID YOU DEFINED 
SUCCESS OF THIS MEETING BY 
NORTH KOREA GIVING UP ITS 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING. 
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 
HOW -- 
>> SURE, THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE 
DOING. 
I DON'T THINK -- YEAH. 
>>REPORTER:  KIM JONG-UN FOR A 
COMPLETE VERIFIABLE 
IRREVERSIBLE -- 
>> I DIDN'T HONESTLY -- 
>>REPORTER:  AND WHY YOU DIDN'T 
SECURE THOSE DETAILS IN THIS 
AGREEMENT? 
>> BECAUSE THERE'S NO TIME. 
I'M HERE FOR ONE DAY. 
WE'RE TOGETHER FOR MANY HOURS 
INTENSIVELY, BUT THE PROCESS IS 
NOW GOING TO TAKE PLACE. 
AND I WOULD BE SURPRISED, MIKE, 
IF THEY HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED 
ALREADY. 
THEY HAVE STARTED. 
THEY BLEW UP THEIR SITES. 
THEY BLEW UP THEIR TESTING 
SITE. 
SO -- BUT I WILL SAY HE KNEW 
PRIOR TO COMING -- YOU KNOW, 
THIS WASN'T LIKE A SURPRISE, IT 
WASN'T LIKE WE'VE NEVER 
DISCUSSED IT. 
WE DISCUSSED IT, MIKE DISCUSSED 
IT VERY STRONGLY WITH HIS 
COUNTERPART IN NORTH KOREA. 
THEY KNEW THAT THIS WAS -- 
LET'S SAY THEY DIDN'T AGREE TO 
THAT, I COULDN'T SIGN ANY 
AGREEMENT. 
THERE WAS NO AGREEMENT THAT 
COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNED. 
SO THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT, AND IT 
WASN'T A BIG POINT TODAY 
BECAUSE REALLY THIS HAD BEEN 
TAKEN CARE OF MORE THAN ANY 
OTHER THING BECAUSE IT WAS ALL 
ABOUT THIS. 
THIS HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF 
BEFORE WE GOT HERE. 
SO WHEN WE BROUGHT THAT UP 
TODAY, YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE, 
IT'S VERY STRONG. 
IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT. 
YES, MA'AM. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
MILITARY CONSEQUENCES FOR NORTH 
KOREA IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW 
THROUGH ON THE COMMITMENTS THAT 
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? 
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TALK 
-- YEAH, I KNOW. 
THAT'S A TOUGH THING TO TALK 
ABOUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO 
BE THREATENING. 
I DON'T WANT TO BE THREATENING. 
THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT, AND 
YOU'VE SEEN WHAT WAS PERHAPS 
GOING TO HAPPEN, AND, YOU KNOW, 
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE. 
WE THINK WE HAVE BIG CITIES, 
YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK WHERE IT 
HAS 8 MILLION PEOPLE, WE THINK 
IT IS A BIG CITY. 
SEOUL HAS 28 MILLION PEOPLE, 
THINK ABOUT THAT, AND IT'S 
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BORDER. 
IT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE DMZ, 
IT'S RIGHT THERE. 
IF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED -- 
I'VE HEARD, OH, 100,000 PEOPLE. 
I THINK YOU COULD HAVE LOST 20 
MILLION PEOPLE, 30 MILLION 
PEOPLE. 
THIS IS REALLY AN HONOR FOR ME 
TO BE DOING THIS BECAUSE I 
THINK, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY 
YOU COULD HAVE LOST 30, 40, 50 
MILLION PEOPLE. 
THE CITY OF SEOUL, ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST CITIES IN THE WORLD IS 
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BORDER. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU ONCE SPOKE 
ABOUT FIRE AND FURY, IS THAT NO 
LONGER THE CASE? 
>> WELL, AT THAT TIME WE NEEDED 
PERHAPS FIRE AND FURY BECAUSE 
WE COULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THAT 
KIND OF CAPABILITY FROM THE 
STANDPOINT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, AND CERTAINLY JAPAN 
WASN'T GOING TO ALLOW IT 
EITHER. 
JAPAN IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR. 
>>REPORTER:  ONE MORE THING. 
MR. PRESIDENT, COULD YOU TELL 
US ABOUT THE VIDEO THAT YOU 
SHOWED BEFORE THIS? 
>> YEAH. 
>>REPORTER:  WHEN DID YOU SHOW 
THAT TO KIM, WHAT WAS THE GOAL 
THERE? 
>> TODAY. 
WE HAD IT MADE UP BY SOME -- I 
HOPE YOU LIKED IT. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING 
ENOUGH TO SHOW, ONE IN ENGLISH 
AND ONE IN KOREAN. 
AND WE HAD IT MADE UP. 
I SHOWED IT TO HIM TODAY, 
DURING THE MEETING, TOWARD THE 
END OF THE MEETING, AND I THINK 
HE LOVED IT. 
THEY WERE GIVEN -- WE DIDN'T 
HAVE A BIG SCREEN LIKE YOU HAVE 
THE LUXURY OF HAVING. 
WE DIDN'T NEED IT BECAUSE WE 
HAD IT ON A CASSETTE, AN  iPAD, 
AND THEY PLAYED IT. 
AND ABOUT EIGHT OF THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE 
WATCHING IT, AND I THOUGHT THEY 
WERE FASCINATE BID IT. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS WELL DONE. 
I SHOWED IT TO YOU BECAUSE 
THAT'S THE FUTURE. 
I MEAN, THAT VERY WELL COULD BE 
THE FUTURE. 
AND THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS 
JUST NOT A VERY GOOD 
ALTERNATIVE. 
IT'S JUST NOT GOOD. 
BUT I SHOWED IT BECAUSE I 
REALLY WANT HIM TO DO 
SOMETHING. 
NOW, I DON'T THINK I HAD TO 
SHOW IT BECAUSE I REALLY 
BELIEVE HE WANTS TO -- I THINK 
HE WANTS TO GET IT DONE. 
YES, GO AHEAD. 
HOW'S STATEN ISLAND FERRY 
DOING, OKAY? 
>>REPORTER:  GOING WELL. 
>> HE WROTE THE BEST STORY 
ABOUT ME WITH THE STATEN ISLAND 
FERRY AND AFTER THAT HE'S NEVER 
WRITTEN A GOOD STORY. 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 
>>REPORTER:  IT'S A LONG TIME 
AGO, SIR. 
>> IT'S A LONG TIME AGO. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 
IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK FOR YOU 
ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. 
YOU'RE LEAVING THIS SUMMIT HERE 
IN SINGAPORE HAVING DETERMINED 
THAT KIM JONG-UN IS A TALENTED 
MAN. 
YOU LEFT THE G7 SUMMIT A FEW 
DAYS AGO IN CANADA HAVING 
DETERMINED THAT PRIME MINISTER 
TRUDEAU IS WEAK AND DISHONEST. 
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO AMERICA'S 
ALLIES WHO WORRY THAT YOU MIGHT 
BE JEOPARDIZING OUR LONG-TERM 
ALLIANCES AND WHO WORRY THAT 
YOU MIGHT BE TREATING OUR 
HISTORIC FRIENDS AS ENEMY AND 
OUR HISTORIC ENEMIES AS FRIEND? 
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK 
IT'S A VERY FAIR QUESTION. 
I HAD A VERY GOOD MEETING WITH 
THE G7, AND I LEFT THE MEETING. 
AND I'LL BE HONEST, WE ARE 
BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF BY 
VIRTUALLY EVERY ONE OF THOSE 
COUNTRIES, VERY, VERY 
SERIOUSLY. 
NOW, THE UNITED STATES, BECAUSE 
OF BAD MANAGEMENT AT THE TOP, 
BECAUSE OF PRESIDENTS THAT 
DIDN'T CARE ABOUT TRADE OR 
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT OR 
WHATEVER REASON, FOR MANY YEARS 
WITH CHINA BEING OBVIOUSLY THE 
MOST SUCCESSFUL AT IT, BUT THE 
EUROPEAN UNION IS SECOND, $151 
BILLION WE LOST, THEY WERE 
REPRESENTED AT THE MEETING, AND 
WE'RE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF 
ON TRADE. 
CANADA DOES HAVE VERY BIG 
ADVANTAGES OVER US IN TERMS OF 
TRADE DEFICITS. 
WE HAVE A BIG TRADE DEFICIT 
WITH CANADA. 
I WAS READING WHERE, OH, IT'S 
ACTUALLY A SURPLUS. 
IT'S NOT A SURPLUS. 
IT'S EITHER 17, BUT IT COULD 
ACTUALLY BE 100. 
YOU KNOW, THEY PUT OUT A 
DOCUMENT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU 
SAW IT, THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO 
SEE IT, BUT WE FOUND IT, 
PERHAPS THEY WERE TRYING TO 
SHOW THE POWER THEY HAVE, IT'S 
CLOSE TO $100 BILLION A YEAR 
LOST WITH CANADA. 
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR FARM 
PRODUCTS, MANY OF THEM, THEY 
CHARGE WHAT WAS 270%, BUT 
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THE OTHER DAY 
THAT A FEW MONTHS AGO THEY 
RAISED IT TO 295% FOR DAIRY 
PRODUCTS. 
AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO OUR 
FARMERS, AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR 
TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR COUNTRY, 
THE WORKERS, THE FARMERS, THE 
COMPANIES, AND WE ARE NOT ABLE 
TO -- THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS 
BARRIERS UP, THEY HAVE 
TREMENDOUS TARIFFS. 
SO WHEN I PUT IN A A 
COUNTERVEILING TARIFF JUST TO 
GET US UP A LITTLE BIT SO THE 
BALANCE ISN'T SO MUCH, IT'S 
LIKE THIS, THEY SAID, OH, 
THAT'S SO TERRIBLE. 
I SAID WHAT'S TERRIBLE. 
WE HAVE TO CATCH YOU A LITTLE 
BIT. 
WE HAVE TO HAVE A LITTLE 
BALANCE, EVEN IF IT'S NOT 
COMPLETE, WE HAVE TO HAVE A 
LITTLE BALANCE. 
I SAY THIS WITH MANY COUNTRIES. 
ANYWAY, WE CAME -- WE FINISHED 
THE MEETING REALLY EVERYBODY 
WAS HAPPY, AND I GREEDED TO 
SIGN SOMETHING -- I AGREED TO 
SIGN SOMETHING. 
I ASKED FOR CHANGE, I DEMANDED 
CHANGE. 
IN FACT, THE PICTURE WITH 
ANGELA MERKEL WHO I GET ALONG 
WITH VERY WELL WHERE I'M SIT 
THRG LIKE THIS, THAT PICTURE IS 
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE DOCUMENT 
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE THE 
FINAL DOCUMENT AS CHANGED BY 
THE CHANGES THAT I REQUESTED. 
THAT WAS VERY FRIENDLY -- I 
KNOW IT DIDN'T LOOK FRIENDLY 
AND I KNOW IT WAS REPORTED SORT 
OF NASTY BOTH WAYS, I WAS ANGRY 
AT HER. 
ACTUALLY, WE WERE JUST TALKING, 
THE WHOLE GROUP ABOUT SOMETHING 
UNRELATED TO EVERYTHING, VERY 
FRIENDLY, WAITING FOR THE 
DOCUMENT TO COME BACK SO I 
COULD READ IT BEFORE I LEAVE. 
ANYWAY, I LEFT AND IT WAS VERY 
FRIENDLY. 
WHEN I GOT ONTO THE PLANE, I 
THINK THAT JUSTIN PROBABLY 
DIDN'T KNOW THAT AIR FORCE ONE 
HAS ABOUT 20 TELEVISIONS, AND I 
SEE THE TELEVISION, AND HE'S 
GIVING A NEWS CONFERENCE ABOUT 
HOW HE WILL NOT BE PUSHED 
AROUND BY THE UNITED STATES. 
AND I SAY PUSH HIM AROUND? 
WE JUST SHOOK HANDS. 
IT WAS VERY FRIENDLY. 
LOOK, COUNTRIES CANNOT CONTINUE 
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US ON 
TRADE. 
THE NUMBERS ARE OUT. 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, 
AND OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS, 
BUT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
YEARS THIS COUNTRY HAS LOST 
$800 BILLION ON TRADE WITH 
OTHER COUNTRIES, THE BIGGEST 
ONE BEING CHINA, $800 BILLION, 
$151 WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 
THEY DON'T TAKE OUR 
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, BARELY. 
THEY DON'T TAKE A LOT OF WHAT 
WE HAVE, AND YET THEY SEND 
MERCEDES IN TO US, THEY SEND 
BMWs INTO US BY THE MILLIONS. 
IT'S VERY UNFAIR. 
AND IT'S VERY UNFAIR TO OUR 
WORKERS, AND I'M GOING TO 
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT, AND IT WON'T 
EVEN BE TOUGH. 
THANK YOU. 
GO AHEAD. 
GO AHEAD. [ 
INAUDIBLE  ] 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO INVOLVE 
CONGRESS, YES. 
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, I REALLY DID, 
OTHER THAN HE HAD A NEWS 
CONFERENCE THAT HE HAD BECAUSE 
HE ASSUMED I WAS IN AN AIRPLANE 
AND I WASN'T WATCHING. 
HE LEARNED THAT'S GOING TO COST 
A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE PEOPLE 
OF CANADA. 
HE LEARNED. 
YOU CAN'T DO THAT. 
YOU CAN'T DO THAT. 
WE LAUGHED. 
WE HAD A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP. 
I'VE HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP 
WITH JUSTIN. 
I HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
-- I HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH ANGELA 
MERKEL. 
BUT ON NATO WE'RE PAYING 4.2%, 
SHE'S PAYING 1% OF A MUCH 
SMALLER G.D.P. 
THAN WE HAVE. 
WE'RE PAYING 4.2% ON A MUCH 
LARGER. 
WE'RE PAYING FOR -- I MEAN, 
ANYONE CAN SAY ANYWHERE FROM 
60% TO 90% OF NATO AND THEN 
WE'RE PROTECTING COUNTRIES ON 
EUROPE AND THEY KILL US ON 
TRADE. 
IT'S UNFAIR. 
IT'S UNFAIR TO OUR TAXPAYERS 
AND OUR PEOPLE. 
NO, VI A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
JUSTIN -- I HAVE A VERY GOOD 
RELATIONSHIP WITH JUSTIN AND I 
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH 
CHAIRMAN KIM RIGHT NOW. 
I HOPE IT'S GOOD. 
BECAUSE IF IT'S GOOD, WE'RE 
GOING TO SOLVE A IT. 
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING FOR A 
LITTLE WHILE? 
IT'S UP TO THE LEGENDARY SARAH 
HUCKABEE SANDERS. 
SHOULD WE KEEP GOING, SARAH? 
OKAY. 
WE'LL GO. 
WELL, I DON'T CARE. 
HEY, YOU KNOW, IT JUST MEANS WE 
GET HOME A LITTLE LATER IN THE 
EVENING, RIGHT? 
YEAH, GO AHEAD. 
SURE. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  HI, MR. PRESIDENT. 
>> HOW ARE YOU? 
>>REPORTER:  I'M GOOD. 
I'M FROM THE STRAITS TIMES OF 
SINGAPORE. 
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED OUR FOOD. 
>> BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY. 
I DID. 
>>REPORTER:  I JUST WANTED TO 
FIND OUT, YOU DESCRIBED THIS AS 
A PROCESS. 
WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP? 
IS THERE SOME ONGOING DIALOGUE? 
>> YES. 
WE'RE GETTING TOGETHER NEXT 
WEEK TO GO INTO THE DETAILS. 
YEAH, NEXT WEEK WITH JOHN 
BOLTON AND OUR ENTIRE TEAM TO 
GO OVER THE DETAILS AND TO GET 
THIS STUFF DONE. 
WE WANT TO GET IT DONE, HE 
WANTS TO GET IT DONE. 
WE'RE ALSO WORKING VERY MUCH 
WITH SOUTH KOREA, WE'RE WORKING 
WITH JAPAN, ARE WE'RE WORKING 
WITH CHINA TO A LESSER EXTENT, 
BUT WE'RE WORKING WITH CHINA. 
>>REPORTER:  AND YOU ARE COMING 
BACK TO SINGAPORE? 
>> I WOULD COME BACK GLADLY. 
YOUR PRIME MINISTER WAS 
FANTASTIC. 
WE WERE WITH HIM YESTERDAY. 
HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB. 
VERY WELCOMING. 
PROBABLY MADE A DIFFERENCE, 
ACTUALLY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
>> YES, MA'AM. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THAT FIRST 
INTERACTION WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 
THIS MORNING THAT MADE YOU 
DECIDE NOT TO WALK AWAY AFTER 
YOU SAID THAT YOU WOULD KNOW 
WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE IF HE 
WAS SINCERE? 
>> I'VE SAID THAT ABOUT 
RELATIONSHIP, I'VE SAID THAT 
ABOUT PEOPLE. 
YOU KNOW, IN THE FIRST SECOND 
-- I WAS GENEROUS, I SAID FIVE 
SECONDS. 
BUT IN THE FIRST SECOND, IN 
SOME CASES, SOMETIMES THAT 
DOESN'T WORK OUT, BUT SOMETIMES 
IT DOES. 
FROM THE BEGINNING WE GOT 
ALONG. 
BUT THIS MADE A LOT OF 
GROUNDWORK. 
THIS WASN'T LIKE WE WENT AND WE 
STARTED TALKING ABOUT -- AS YOU 
KNOW, RIGHT? 
WE DIDN'T JUST COME IN AND 
START TALKING ABOUT THESE VERY 
COMPLEX SUBJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN 
GOING ON FOR 70 YEARS. 
WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS FOR 
MONTHS, AND, YOU KNOW, ONCE THE 
RHETORIC STOPPED, ONCE THEY DID 
A GREAT THING -- YOU KNOW, 
NORTH KOREA DID A GREAT THING 
BY GOING TO THE OLYMPICS 
BECAUSE THE OLYMPICS AND 
PRESIDENT MOON WILL TELL YOU 
THIS, THE OLYMPICS WAS NOT 
EXACTLY DOING GREAT. 
PEOPLE DIDN'T FEEL LIKE BEING 
BOMBED OUT OF THE OPENING 
CEREMONIES, YOU KNOW, THEY 
WEREN'T EXACTLY SELLING 
TICKETS. 
AND AS SOON AS THE CHAIRMAN, 
CHAIRMAN KIM SAID LET'S 
PARTICIPATE IN THE OLYMPICS, IT 
SOLD LIKE WILDFIRE AND WAS A 
GREAT SUCCESS AS AN OLYMPICS. 
IT WAS A GREAT SUCCESS. 
HE DID A GREAT THING. 
BUT SINCE THAT TIME, PRETTY 
MUCH SINCE THAT TIME -- 
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, A 
DELEGATION CAME FROM SOUTH 
KOREA THEY CAME TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE, THEY TOLD ME THINGS 
INCLUDING WE'D BE WILLING TO 
DENUKE. 
WE HAVE ONE OF THE GREAT PEOPLE 
HERE TODAY, THAT THEY WERE 
WILLING TO DENUKE, AND ONCE 
THAT STARTED, WE HAVE BEEN 
REALLY TALKING THAT FROM THE 
END OF THE OLYMPICS WHEN THE 
WHOLE DELEGATION GAME TO SAY 
VARIOUS THINGS INCLUDING 
DENUKING. 
>>REPORTER:  IF I MAY, A SECOND 
QUESTION, IN THE DOCUMENT THAT 
YOU SIGNED EARLIER TODAY, NORTH 
KOREA AGREED TO COMMIT TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
TO BORROW A PHRASE THAT YOU 
HAVE USED TO CRITICIZE YOUR 
PREDECESSORS AND POLITICAL 
OPPONENT, HOW DO YOU ENSURE 
THAT NORTH KOREA IS NOT ALL 
TALK, NO ACTION. 
>>REPORTER:  I THINK CAN YOU 
ENSURE ANYTHING? 
CAN I ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GOING 
TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN PROPERLY 
WHEN YOU SIT DOWN? 
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T ENSURE 
ANYTHING. 
ALL I CAN SAY IS THEY WANT TO 
MAKE A DEAL. 
THAT'S WHAT I DO. 
MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN DEALS. 
I'VE DONE GREAT AT IT. 
THAT'S WHAT I DO. 
AND I KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY WANTS 
TO DEAL, AND I KNOW WHEN 
SOMEBODY DOESN'T. 
A LOT OF POLITICIANS DON'T. 
THAT'S NOT THEIR THING. 
BUT IT IS MY THING. 
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS REALLY 
COULD HAVE BEEN DONE I THINK 
EASIER A LONG TIME AGO. 
BUT I KNOW FOR A -- I JUST FEEL 
VERY STRONGLY, MY INSTINCT, MY 
ABILITY OR TALENT, THEY WANT TO 
MAKE A DEAL, AND MAKING A DEAL 
IS A GREAT THING FOR THE WORLD. 
IT'S ALSO A GREAT THING FOR 
CHINA BECAUSE I CAN'T IMAGINE 
THAT CHINA HAS -- YOU KNOW, IS 
HAPPY WITH SOMEBODY HAVING 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS SO CLOSE. 
SO, YOU KNOW, AND CHINA WAS 
VERY HELPFUL. 
SO I THINK HE WANTS TO MAKE A 
DEAL. 
CAN ANYBODY BE CERTAIN? 
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE CERTAIN 
SOON BECAUSE THE NEGOTIATIONS 
CONTINUE. 
OKAY? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  YOU MENTIONED THAT 
YOU HAVE RAISED EXTENSIVELY THE 
ISSUE OF HUMAN RIGHT WITH 
CHAIRMAN KIM. 
>> YES. 
>>REPORTER:  I WONDER WHAT YOU 
WOULD SAY TO THE GROUP OF 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE NO ABILITY 
WHATSOEVER TO HEAR OR TO SEE 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THE 
100,000 NORTH KOREANS KEPT IN A 
NETWORK OF GULAGS, HAVE YOU 
BETRAYED THEM BY LEGITIMATIZING 
THE REGIME IN PYONGYANG? 
>> NO. 
I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM 
BECAUSE I THINK THINGS WILL 
CHANGE. 
I THINK I'VE HELPED THEM. 
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN SAY. 
ALL I CAN DO IS DO WHAT I CAN 
DO. 
WE HAVE TO STOP THE 
NUCLEARATION, WE HAVE TO DO 
OTHER THINGS AND THAT'S A VERY 
IMPORTANT THING. 
SO AT A PERSON POINT HOPEFULLY 
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ASK ME A MUCH 
MORE POSITIVE QUESTION OR MAKE 
A STATEMENT. 
BUT NOT MUCH I CAN DO RIGHT 
NOW. 
AT A CERTAIN POINT I REALLY DO 
BELIEVE HE'S GOING TO DO THINGS 
ABOUT IT. 
I THINK THEY ARE ONE OF THE 
GREAT WINNERS TODAY, THAT LARGE 
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
I THINK ULTIMATELY THEY ARE 
GOING TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT 
WINNERS AS A GROUP. 
YES, SIR, GO AHEAD. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  WOULD YOU EVER 
CONSIDER REMOVING THE SANCTIONS 
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT 
IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION? 
>> NO. 
I WANT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. 
I WANT TO KNOW THAT IT WON'T BE 
HAPPENING. 
AND, AGAIN, ONCE YOU START THAT 
PROCESS, THEY'LL BE APPOINTED, 
WHICH EVEN THOUGH YOU WON'T BE 
FINISHED FOR A WHILE BECAUSE IT 
CAN'T HAPPEN SCIENTIFICALLY OR 
MECHANICALLY, BUT YOU'RE NOT 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK. 
ONCE WE REACH THAT POINT, I'LL 
START TO GIVE THAT VERY SERIOUS 
THOUGHT. 
YES, GO AHEAD. 
GO AHEAD. 
YOU FIRST. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, DID 
YOU ALSO DISCUSS THE COST OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION AND HOW NORTH 
KOREA IS ABOUT TO FOOT THE BILL 
OR THE CRIPPLING SANCTIONS 
REMAIN IN PLACE? 
>> WELL, I THINK THAT SOUTH 
KOREA AND I THINK THAT JAPAN 
WILL HELP THEM VERY GREATLY. 
I THINK THEY'RE PREPARED TO 
HELP THEM. 
THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE 
TO HELP THEM. 
I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO HELP 
THEM VERY GREATLY. 
WE WON'T HAVE TO HELP THEM. 
THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN 
PAYING A BIG PRICE AT A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT PLACES, BUT SOUTH 
KOREA WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS RIGHT 
NEXT DOOR IN JAPAN WHICH 
ESSENTIALLY IS NEXT DOOR, 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE HELPING 
THEM, AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING 
TO BE DOING A VERY GENEROUS JOB 
AND A GOOD JOB, SO THEY WILL BE 
HELPING THEM. 
YES, MA'AM, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
úPR 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>REPORTER:  I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW 
UP ON STEVE'S QUESTION. 
HE ASKED YOU HOW LONG IT WOULD 
TAKE TO DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
YOU SAID A LONG TIME. 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
>> WHEN YOU SAY A LONG TIME, I 
THINK WE WILL DO IT AS FAST AS 
IT CAN BE DONE SCIENTIFICALLY, 
AS FAST AS IT CAN BE DONE 
MECHANICALLY. 
I DON'T THINK -- I MEAN, I'VE 
READ HORROR STORIES. 
IT'S A 15-YEAR PROCESS, OKAY, 
ASSUMING YOU WANTED TO DO IT 
QUICKLY. 
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. 
I THINK WHOEVER WROTE THAT IS 
WRONG. 
BUT THERE WILL BE A POINT AT 
WHICH WHEN YOU'RE 20% THROUGH 
YOU CAN'T GO BACK. 
I HAD AN UNCLE WHO WAS A GREAT 
PROFESSOR FOR I BELIEVE 40 
YEARS AT M.I.T., AND I USED TO 
DISCUSS NUCLEAR WITH HIM ALL 
THE TIME. 
HE WAS A GREAT EXPERT, A GREAT 
BRILLIANT GENIUS, DR. TRUMP 
THERE AT M.I.T. 
IN FACT, M.I.T. 
SENT ME A BOOK ON MY UNCLE. 
WE USED TO TALK ABOUT NUCLEAR. 
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A VERY 
COMPLEX SUBJECT. 
IT'S NOT JUST, LIKE, OH, GEE, 
LET'S GET RID O THE NUKES. 
IT TAKES A PERIOD OF TIME. 
BUT THE MAIN PERIOD OF TIME 
THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS THAT 
FIRST PERIOD. 
WHEN YOU HIT A CERTAIN POINT 
YOU CAN'T GO BACK. 
IT'S VERY HARD TO GO BACK. 
>>REPORTER:  AND HOW LONG WILL 
THAT TAKE? 
>> WE DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'LL GO 
PRETTY QUICKLY. 
GO AHEAD. 
SURE. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
I WANTED TO ASK YOU AGAIN ON 
THE SANCTIONS CAMPAIGN. 
YOU ALLUDED AT THE VERY 
BEGINNING THAT THE CHINESE ARE 
NOT DOING AS GREAT A JOB 
SECURING THE BORDER AS THEY 
WERE BEFORE. 
YOU EXPRESSED, YOU KNOW, SOME 
DOUBTS WHEN KIM WENT TO SEE 
PRESIDENT XI, THE RUSSIAN 
FOREIGN MINISTER WAS IN 
PYONGYANG AND SAID THERE 
SHOULDN'T BE ANY SANCTIONS 
WHILE THESE NEGOTIATIONS ARE 
UNDER WAY, AND THE SOUTH 
KOREANS ARE NOW TALKING ABOUT 
RESTORING SOME FORM OF TRADE. 
SO WITH ALL OF THOSE PLAYERS 
APPEARING TO BE MOVING TOWARD 
ERODING SANCTIONS, HOW CAN YOU 
KEEP THE SANCTIONS REGIME IN 
PLACE? 
WHAT LEVERAGE DO YOU HAVE ON 
THESE COUNTRIES? 
>> WELL, I THINK WE HAVE A LOT 
OF LEVERAGE. 
I THINK WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 
LEVERAGE. 
I DO BELIEVE THAT CHINA, 
DESPITE MY RELATIONSHIP WITH 
PRESIDENT XI, A MAN WHO I TOLD 
YOU I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR 
AND LIKE ALSO A LOT, YOU KNOW, 
WE'RE HAVING VERY TOUGH TALKS 
ON TRADE. 
AND I THINK THAT PROBABLY 
AFFECTS CHINA SOMEWHAT, BUT I 
HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO. 
AND I THINK OVER THE LAST TWO 
MONTHS THE BORDER IS MORE OPEN 
THAN IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST 
STARTED. 
BUT THAT IS WHAT IT IS. 
WE HAVE TO DO IT. 
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS, 
TREMENDOUS DEFICIT IN TRADE, 
COMMONLY KNOWN AS A TRADE 
DEFICIT. 
WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS DEFICIT IN 
TRADE WITH CHINA, AND WE HAVE 
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 
WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO LET THAT 
HAPPEN. 
AND I THINK THAT HAS HAD AN 
IMPACT ON MY RELATIONSHIP IN 
TERMS OF THE BORDER. 
I DON'T THINK IT HAS A 
RELATIONSHIP -- YOU KNOW, I 
DON'T THINK IT AFFECTS MY 
FEELING OR MY RELATIONSHIP TO 
PRESIDENT XI, BUT WHEN WE FIRST 
STARTED, WE WEREN'T READY TO GO 
THAT ROUTE, AND AS WE STARTED 
PREPARING AND GETTING READY TO 
DO THAT, I THINK THAT'S HAD AN 
IMPACT ON FRANKLY THE BORDER 
WHICH IS A SHAME. 
BUT I HAVE TO DO IT. 
I HAVE NO CHOICE, FOR OUR 
COUNTRY I HAVE TO DO IT. 
SOUTH KOREA WILL DO WHATEVER IS 
NECESSARY TO GET A DEAL DONE. 
IF THAT MEANS WE CAN'T TRADE, 
WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO 
TRADE. 
THEY'RE DEFINITELY NOT GOING TO 
TRADE. 
IF THEY THINK -- AND THEY WOULD 
DO THIS WITH OUR CONCURRENCE, 
IF THEY THINK THEY CAN DO SOME 
WORK BECAUSE WE'RE VERY FAR 
DOWN THE LINE, WE'RE ACTUALLYúV 
YOU KNOW, THAT DOCUMENT WHEN 
YOU READ IT TODAY, THAT'S FAR 
DOWN THE LINE. 
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT JUST 
HAPPENED TO BE PUT TOGETHER. 
THAT WAS DONE OVER MONTHS. 
AND, AGAIN, THE RHETORIC WAS 
IMPORTANT AND THE SANCTIONS 
WERE IMPORTANT. 
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHICH ONE WAS 
MORE IMPORTANT. 
THEY WERE BOTH IMPORTANT. 
YEAH, GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 
DAVID SANGER FROM THE "NEW YORK 
TIMES." 
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD 
GIVE US SOME SENSE OF WHETHER 
THE CHAIRMAN KIM TOLD YOU HOW 
MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS HE 
BELIEVES HE'S MADE, WHETHER 
HE'S WILLING TO TURN THOSE OVER 
FIRST, AND THEN WHETHER IN YOUR 
MIND YOU NEED TO DO MORE THAN 
WAS DONE IN THE IRAN DEAL FOR 
ACTUALLY DISMANTLING THE -- 
BOTH THE URANIUM AND THE 
PLUTONIUM PROCESSES, AND 
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAD A SENSE 
THAT CHAIRMAN KIM REALLY 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT THAT INVOLVES 
AND HAD A TIMETABLE IN HIS OWN 
MIND OF SHUTTING THAT? 
>> WELL, DAVID, I CAN TELL YOU 
HE UNDERSTANDS. 
HE UNDERSTANDS IT SO WELL, HE 
UNDERSTANDS IT BETTER THAN THE 
PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK 
FOR HIM. 
THAT'S AN EASY ONE. 
AS FAR AS WHAT HE HAS, IT'S 
SUBSTANTIAL, VERY SUBSTANTIAL. 
THE TIMING WILL GO QUICKLY. 
I BELIEVE YOU'LL SEE SOME GOOD 
ACTION. 
I MEAN, AS AN EXAMPLE, ONE OF 
THE THINGS WITH THE MISSILE 
SITE I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY 
SURPRISED TO HEAR THAT, THAT IT 
WAS A THROW-IN AT THE END, THE 
MISSILE SITE. 
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE, DAVID, 
THAT IT'S GOING TO GO VERY 
QUICKLY. 
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT'S 
GOING TO GO FAST. 
AND IT IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL 
ARSENAL, THERE'S NO QUESTION 
ABOUT IT. 
YOU KNOW, I USED TO SAY MAYBE 
IT'S ALL TALK AND NO ACTION. 
BUT WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD 
INTELLIGENCE INTO THAT, 
ALTHOUGH PROBABLY LESS THERE 
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY, YOU 
UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE BETTER 
THAN ANYBODY IN THE ROOM, 
PROBABLY LESS THERE THAN IN ANY 
OTHER COUNTRY. 
BUT WE HAVE ENOUGH INTELLIGENCE 
TO KNOW THAT WHAT THEY HAVE IS 
VERY SUBSTANTIAL. 
THIS IS WHY, DAVID, I ALWAYS 
SAY THAT THIS SHOULDN'T HAVE 
TAKEN PLACE SO LATE INTO THE 
PROCESS. 
WOULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN BETTER 
IF IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO OR 20 
YEARS AGO OR 15 YEARS AGO WHEN 
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT NOT HAVING A SUCCESSFUL 
MEETING LIKE TODAY? 
AND I STILL LOVE MY FIRST 
INTERVIEW WITH YOU, DAVID. 
STILL HAVE THAT INTERVIEW, 
ACTUALLY. 
YEAH, GO AHEAD. 
THANK YOU. 
>>REPORTER:  IF 
THERE IS A SECOND SUMMIT -- 
THAT'S OKAY. 
IF THERE IS A SECOND SUMMIT 
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN, 
WOULD IT BE IN PYONGYANG OR 
WASHINGTON? 
>> WE HAVEN'T SET THAT UP. 
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER 
SUMMIT. 
WE'LL PROBABLY NEED -- OR 
MEETING, WE COULD USE A 
DIFFERENT TERM, BUT WE'LL 
PROBABLY NEED ANOTHER ONE. 
I WILL SAY THIS, WE'RE MUCH 
FURTHER ALONG THAN I WOULD HAVE 
THOUGHT. 
I DID NOT THINK WE'D BE HERE. 
AND I TOLD PEOPLE, I DIDN'T 
WANT TO BUILD UP PEOPLE'S HOPES 
TOO MUCH, I TOLD PEOPLE, I 
THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A 
SUCCESSFUL MEETING IF WE GOT 
ALONG, WE DEVELOPED A 
RELATIONSHIP, AND WE COULD HAVE 
MAYBE GOTTEN TO THIS POINT IN 
THREE OR FOUR MONTHS FROM NOW. 
BUT IT REALLY HAPPENED VERY 
QUICKLY. 
A LOT OF THAT WAS BECAUSE OF 
THE FOUNDATION THAT WAS, YOU 
KNOW, PUT DOWN BEFORE WE MET. 
A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED VERY 
FAST. 
WE DIDN'T HAVE, AS AN EXAMPLE, 
BRINGING BACK THE REMAINS, THAT 
WAS NOT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
WAS ON OUR AGENDA TODAY. 
I BROUGHT THAT UP AT THE VERY 
END BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD 
TALKED TO ME ABOUT IT. 
AND I BROUGHT IT UP AT THE VERY 
END, AND HE WAS REALLY VERY 
GRACIOUS. 
INSTEAD OF SAYING, WELL, LET'S 
TALK ABOUT IT THE NEXT TIME, HE 
SAID IT MAKES SENSE, WE WILL DO 
IT. 
AND HE KNEW -- YOU KNOW, THEY 
KNOW WHERE MANY OF THOSE 
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ARE, WHERE 
THEY'RE BURIED, ALONG ROADS, 
ALONG HIGHWAYS, ALONG PATHS 
USUALLY BECAUSE OUR SOLDIERS 
WERE MOVING BACK AND FORTH, 
THEY MOVED RAPIDLY. 
IT'S VERY SAD. 
BUT HE KNEW -- AND THAT WAS 
BROUGHT UP AT THE VERY END. 
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY 
GREAT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO 
IT. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT. 
YES, GO AHEAD, PLEASE. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
ONE AMERICAN NEWS, 
CONGRATULATIONS. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU FOR THE NICE WAY YOU 
TREAT ME TOO, I APPRECIATE IT. 
REALLY, IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL 
WHAT YOU DO. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  SO YOU -- 
>> AND NOW I'LL PROBABLY GET 
THIS KILLER QUESTION. 
>>REPORTER:  WELL, I DO WANT TO 
TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF NORTH 
KOREA. 
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT. 
>>REPORTER:  SPECIFICALLY THE 
PEOPLE. 
KIM JONG-UN IS SAYING HE'S 
WANTING A BRIGHTER FUTURE WITH 
PROSPERITY FOR HIS PEOPLE, YET 
WE KNOW THEY'VE LIVED UNDER 
OPPRESSION. 
YOU SHOWED HIM THIS VIDEO OF 
WHAT THE FUTURE COULD BE LIKE, 
BUT DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA 
SPECIFICALLY OF THE MODEL THAT 
HE WOULD LIKE TO GO TOWARDS? 
ECONOMICALLY, IS HE OPEN TO 
MORE ECONOMIC FREEDOM? 
>> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. 
SO YOU SAW THE TAPE TODAY, AND 
I THINK THAT WAS DONE REALLY 
WELL. 
BUT THAT WAS DONE AT THE 
HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUTURE 
DEVELOPMENT. 
I TOLD HIM, YOU MAY NOT WANT 
THIS, YOU MAY WANT TO DO A MUCH 
SMALLER VERSION OF THIS. 
I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING TO DO 
SOMETHING. 
BUT YOU MAY WANT TO DO A 
SMALLER VERSION. 
YOU MAY NOT WANT THAT WITH THE 
TRAINS AND THE EVERYTHING, YOU 
KNOW, SUPER, EVERYTHING AT THE 
TOP. 
YOU MAY NOT WANT THAT. 
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM, 
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THE 
PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT. 
THEY MAY NOT WANT THAT. 
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT TOO. 
BUT THAT WAS A VERSION OF WHAT 
COULD HAPPEN, WHAT COULD TAKE 
PLACE. 
AS AN EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE GREAT 
BEACHES. 
YOU SEE THAT WHENEVER THEY'RE 
EXPLODING THEIR CANNONS INTO 
THE OCEAN, RIGHT? 
I SAID, BOY, LOOK AT THAT VIEW, 
WOULDN'T THAT MAKE A GREAT 
CONDO. 
I EXPLAINED, INSTEAD OF DOING 
THAT, YOU COULD HAVE THE BEST 
HOTELS IN THE WORLD RIGHT 
THERE. 
THINK OF IT FROM A REAL ESTATE 
PERSPECTIVE. 
VU SOUTH KOREA, YOU HAVE CHINA, 
AND THEY -- YOU HAVE SOUTH 
KOREA, YOU HAVE CHINA AND THEY 
OWN THE LAND IN THE MIDDLE. 
IT'S GREAT, RIGHT? 
I TOLD HIM, I SAID, YOU MAY NOT 
WANT TO DO WHAT'S THERE, YOU 
MAY WANT TO DO A SMALLER 
VERSION OF IT, AND THAT COULD 
BE, ALTHOUGH, I TELL YOU WHAT, 
HE LOOKED AT THAT TAPE, HE 
LOOKED AT THAT  iPAD, AND I'M 
TELLING YOU, THEY REALLY 
ENJOYED IT, I BELIEVE. 
YEAH, GO AHEAD. 
COUPLE MORE. 
WE'LL DO THREE MORE. 
>>REPORTER:  BRIAN BENNETT FROM 
"TIME" MAGAZINE. 
>> HI, BRIAN. 
AM I UNDER COVER AGAIN THIS 
WEEK? 
>>REPORTER:  IT'S ENTIRELY 
POSSIBLE. 
>> I KNOW. 
THAT'S OKAY. 
>>REPORTER:  DO YOU NOW SEE KIM 
JONG-UN AS AN EQUAL? 
>> IN WHAT WAY? 
>>REPORTER:  YOU JUST SHOWED A 
VIDEO THAT SHOWED YOU AND KIM 
JONG-UN ON EQUAL FOOTING AND 
DISCUSSING THE FUTURE OF THE 
COUNTRY. 
>> NO. 
I DON'T THINK THAT -- I DON'T 
VIEW IT THAT WAY. 
SEE, I DON'T VIEW IT THAT WAY. 
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO 
MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE. 
IF I HAVE TO SAY I'M SITTING ON 
A STAGE -- I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND 
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT. 
IF I HAVE TO SAY I'M SITTING ON 
A STAGE WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND 
THAT'S GOING TO GET US TO SAVE 
30 MILLION LIVES, COULD BE MORE 
THAN THAT, I'M WILLING TO SIT 
ON THE STAGE, I'M WILLING TO 
TRAVEL TO SINGAPORE, VERY 
PROUDLY, VERY GLADLY. 
AGAIN, YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN THE 
FACT THAT IT IS TAKING MY TIME, 
THEY HAVE GIVEN UP A TREMENDOUS 
AMOUNT. 
THEY'VE GIVEN IT UP EVEN 
BEFORE, AND EVEN ADD THE 
OLYMPICS TO IT. 
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD ADD THE 
OLYMPICS TO THE QUESTION. 
THEY WENT TO THE OLYMPICS. 
THEY TOOK AN OLYMPICS THAT WAS 
GOING TO BE A MASSIVE FAILURE, 
THAT MAYBE WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN 
OPENED, AND THEY MADE IT A 
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS BY AGREEING 
TO PARTICIPATE. 
ADD THAT TO THE LIST OF THINGS 
THAT THEY'VE DONE. 
SO, BRIAN, IF I CAN SAVE 
MILLIONS OF LIVES BY COMING 
HERE, SITTING DOWN AND 
ESTABLISHING A RELATIONSHIP 
WITH SOMEONE WHO'S A VERY 
POWERFUL MAN, WHO'S GOT FIRM 
CONTROL OF A COUNTRY, AND THAT 
COUNTRY HAS VERY POWERFUL 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS, IT'S MY HONOR 
TO DO IT. 
>>REPORTER:  ARE YOU CONCERNED 
THAT THE VIDEO YOU JUST SHOWED 
COULD BE USED BY KIM AS 
PROPAGANDA TO SHOW HIM -- 
>> NO, I'M NOT CONCERNED AT 
ALL. 
WE COULD USE THAT VIDEO FOR 
OTHER COUNTRIES. 
GO AHEAD. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, IN 
THE YEAR 2000 PRESIDENT CLINTON 
GOT A REQUEST BY KIM-JOFG-IL. 
>> GOT IMPRESSED? 
>>REPORTER:  GOT A REQUEST TO 
TRAVEL TO PYONGYANG AND MEET 
HIM AND CLINTON REFUSED. 
HE SENT SECRETARY OF STATE 
ALBRIGHT 
>> YEAH, HE DID A GREAT DEAL 
AND HE SPENT $3 BILLION AND GOT 
NOTHING AND STARTED MAKING 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, GOT THE 
REQUEST AND RIGHT AWAY WENT 
HERE TO MEET HIM, AND DO YOU 
UNDERSTAND THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAY 
THAT YOU GAVE HIM THE ULTIMATE 
PRESIDENT, A LEGITIMACY FOR A 
REGIME TO OPPRESS ITS PEOPLE 
WITHOUT ONGOING PROCESS BEFORE 
YOU AS THE U.S. PRESIDENT AND 
THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD 
MEET AND SHAKE HANDS WITH THIS 
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA WAS 
PERCEIVED TO BE OPPRESSING 
BRUTALLY HIS OWN PEOPLE? 
>> I THINK WE'VE JUST ANSWERED 
THE QUESTION. 
>>REPORTER:  DO YOU UNDERSTAND? 
>> I UNDERSTAND IT MUCH BETTER 
THAN YOU DO. 
OKAY. 
YEAH. 
GO AHEAD. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
YES. 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 
ELIANA JOHNSON WITH POLITICO. 
>> HI. 
>>REPORTER:  HI. 
YOU MENTIONED A COUPLE SPECIFIC 
CONCESSIONS YOU GOT FROM KIM, 
THE RETURN OF REMAINS AND THE 
DESTRUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR 
SITE, AND I KNOW YOU SAID THAT 
-- 
>> AND MUCH MORE. 
>>REPORTER:  YEAH. 
I KNOW YOU SAID THE LAST THING 
WAS AN ADD-ON, IT WASN'T IN THE 
AGREEMENT BUT HE GAVE YOU HIS 
WORD. 
IF HE DOESN'T FOLLOW THROUGH ON 
THESE THINGS, WHAT ARE YOU 
PREPARED  TO DO IN RESPONSE, 
AND WILL YOU LOSE FAITH IN THIS 
PROCESS? 
>> NO. 
I THINK HE'LL DO IT. 
I REALLY BELIEVE THAT, 
OTHERWISE I WOULDN'T BE DOING 
THIS. 
I REALLY BELIEVE -- AND IT WAS 
REALLY THE ENGINE TESTING SITE 
IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE OTHER 
THINGS THAT THEY'VE AGREED TO 
DO, IT WAS -- THEY HAVE A VERY 
POWERFUL ENGINE TESTING SITE 
THAT, AGAIN, WE'RE ABLE TO SEE 
BECAUSE OF THE HEAT THAT THEY 
-- THAT IT EMITS. 
AND, YEAH, I'M ABLE TO -- I'M 
VERY HAPPY -- I'LL TELL YOU 
WHAT, I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THOSE 
TWO POINT, THE TWO POINTS YOU 
MENTIONED, BUT I THINK YOU 
MIGHT BE REFERRING TO THE THING 
THAT'S NOT IN WHICH IS THE 
ENGINE TESTING SITE. 
I THINK HONESTLY HE'S GOING TO 
DO THESE THINGS. 
I MAY BE WRONG. 
I MEAN, I MAY STAND BEFORE YOU 
IN SIX MONTHS AND SAY, HEY, I 
WAS WRONG. 
I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER ADMIT 
THAT, BUT I'LL FIND SOME KIND 
OF AN EXCUSE. 
ONE MORE. 
COME ON. 
YEAH. 
GO AHEAD. 
SURE. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
THANK YOU. 
>>REPORTER:  MEDIA GROUP CHINA. 
I JUST WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, WILL 
YOU CALL CHINESE PRESIDENT WHEN 
YOU COME BACK TO D.C. TO 
DISCUSS ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS YOU 
MADE TODAY WITH -- 
>> YES, I WILL. 
>>REPORTER:  AND WHAT'S YOUR 
EXPECTATION ABOUT CHINA'S ROLE 
TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS TO 
ESTABLISH THE LONG-TERM PACE 
MECHANISM? 
>> WELL, MY EXPECTATION ABOUT 
CHINA IS THAT CHINA IS A GREAT 
COUNTRY WITH A GREAT LEADER AND 
A FRIEND OF MINE, AND I REALLY 
BELIEVE THAT HE'S HAPPY THAT 
WE'VE MADE THIS KIND OF 
PROGRESS. 
AND I'VE HEARD FROM HIM. 
BUT I WILL BE CALLING HIM VERY 
SHORTLY, MAYBE EVEN BEFORE I 
LAND. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY -- YOU KNOW, 
AND THE UNITED STATES IS A 
GREAT COUNTRY. 
AND WE HAVE SET RECORDS 
ECONOMICALLY, OVER $7 TRILLION 
IN NET WORTH ADDITION TO WHAT 
WE HAVE, AND WE ARE ALMOST 
TWICE THE SIZE -- THE ECONOMY 
OF THE UNITED STATES -- NOBODY 
TALKS  ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU 
DO HEAR A LOT ABOUT CHINA, 
RIGHTFULLY SO, BUT THE UNITED 
STATES NOW IS ALMOST TWICE THE 
SIZE OF THE ECONOMY OF CHINA. 
WE HAVE A GREAT COUNTRY, AND 
WE'RE ON A CORRECT PATH. 
OKAY, ONE MORE, THAT WILL BE 
IT. 
SOUTH KOREA? 
WHERE IS SOUTH KOREA? 
I THINK YOU DESERVE -- GO 
AHEAD. 
YOU DESERVE ONE, YES. 
YOU DESERVE ONE. 
>>REPORTER:  I'VE GOT TWO 
QUESTIONS FOR YOU, MR. 
PRESIDENT. 
FIRST, YOU MENTIONED EARLIER 
THAT YOU WERE GOING TO TALK 
WITH SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT 
MOON JAE-IN OVER THE PHONE. 
>> YES. 
>>REPORTER:  WHAT DO YOU PLAN 
TO DISCUSS WITH HIM? 
>> I JUST WANT TO TELL HIM 
ABOUT THE MEETING, VERY 
SUCCESSFUL, AND HE'LL BE VERY 
MUCH INVOLVED IN THE FINAL 
NEGOTIATION. 
HE'S A VERY, VERY FINE 
GENTLEMAN, ALSO A FRIEND OF 
MINE. 
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING 
TO HIM. 
HE'LL BE VERY HAPPY WHEN HE 
HEARS ABOUT -- I'VE ALREADY 
SENT WORD TO HIM ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
I SENT THE DOCUMENT TO HIM, 
ACTUALLY, AND ALL OF THE 
DETAILS BEHIND THE DOCUMENT. 
SO I'LL BE TALKING TO HIM VERY 
SHORTLY. 
>>REPORTER:  IF I MAY ASK 
ANOTHER QUESTION. 
IN SIGNING THE PEACE TREATY, DO 
YOU HOPE TO -- DO YOU PLAN TO 
WORK THIS OUT WITH NORTH 
KOREA'S CHAIRMAN KIM ONLY OR 
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE 
INVOLVEMENT OF SOUTH KOREA AND 
CHINA AS THE SIGNIFICANT 
NATORY? 
>> I'D LIKE TO HAVE THEM 
INVOLVED ALSO. 
THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER 
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO OR LEGALLY 
WHETHER WE HAVE TO, I DON'T 
CARE. 
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT TO 
HAVE CHINA INVOLVED AND ALSO 
SOUTH KOREA. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 
>> WHAT? 
>>REPORTER:  
>> MIKE, DO THEY HAVE A 
TRANSCRIPT? 
THEY PROBABLY HAVE A ROUGH 
TRANSCRIPT WHICH YOU CAN GIVE 
IF YOU HAVE ONE. 
>>REPORTER:  
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T RECORD IT. 
I DON'T THINK THEY RECORDED IT. 
ARE THERE ANY RECORDINGS OF IT? 
I WISH THERE WERE BECAUSE IT IS 
INTERESTING STUFF. 
>>REPORTER:  
>> IT I DON'T. 
WE PROBABLY HAVE SOME NOTES OR 
SOMETHING, BUT THEY HAVE 
ACTUALLY DETAILED NOTES I WOULD 
IMAGINE. 
BUT WE HAD A GREAT 
CONVERSATION. 
IT WAS A VERY HEART FELT 
CONVERSATION. 
>>REPORTER:  
>> I DON'T HAVE TO VERIFY 
BECAUSE I HAVE ONE OF THE GREAT 
MEMORIES OF ALL TIME, SO I 
DON'T HAVE TO. 
OKAY? 
>>REPORTER:  
>> YEAH. 
BUT I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT. 
BUT WHAT WE DID IS WE'VE HAD 
NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS, WE'VE HAD 
VERY IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS 
ESTABLISHED AT MIKE'S LEVEL AND 
OTHER LEVELS, IN FACT, A COUPLE 
OF PEOPLE ARE HERE FROM -- AS 
YOU KNOW, FROM NORTH KOREA. 
THEY'RE IN THE ROOM. 
WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE 
BACK ALSO. 
SO WHEN WE WENT INTO THIS FINAL 
AGREEMENT, VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE 
REALLY DIDN'T GO IN COLD, WE 
WENT IN WITH TREMENDOUS 
RELATIONSHIP AND TREMENDOUS 
KNOWLEDGE, AND I THINK THAT'S 
WHY WE GOT IT DONE. 
SO I'M GOING TO HEAD BACK. 
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU FOLKS, 
BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE 
I'VE TAKEN IT EASY. 
SO NOW WE CAN TAKE IT A LITTLE 
BIT EASIER AND THEN THE WORK 
BEGINS AGAIN. 
AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY 
BEING HERE. 
I HOPE WE'VE ANSWERED YOUR 
QUESTIONS, AND THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
AND SORT OF CONGRATULATIONS TO 
EVERYBODY BECAUSE THIS IS 
REALLY -- TO ME IT'S A VERY 
IMPORTANT ENT IN WORLD 
HISTORY AND TO BE REALLY TRUE 
TO MYSELF, I HAVE TO ADD, I 
WANT TO GET IT COMPLETED. 
SO, MIKES, OUR WHOLE TEAM HAS 
TO GET TO WORK AND GET IT 
COMPLETED BECAUSE OTHERWISE 
WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB. 
BUT IF YOU DON'T GET THE BALL 
OVER THE GOAL LINE, IT DOESN'T 
MEAN ENOUGH, OKAY? 
SO THANK YOU AND SORT OF 
CONGRATULATIONS TO EVERYBODY IN 
THE ROOM. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
APPRECIATE IT. 
THANK YOU. 
 
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, HOW 
DO YOU FEEL TODAY?
>> THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES TAKING QUESTIONS FROM 
REPORTERS AFTER A HISTORIC 
MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-
UN OF NORTH KOREA. 
WE'VE GOT A LOT TO BREAK DOWN. 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WAS AN 
HOUR AND FIVE MINUTES. 
THE PRESIDENT ANSWERING A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS 
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO CBS NEWS 
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ED 
O'KEEFE. 
HE'S JOINING ME IN WASHINGTON, 
AND OF COURSE HERE ON SET ISAAC 
STONE FISH. 
FIRST, ED, TO YOU. 
THERE'S A LOT TO UNRAVEL HERE. 
AS WE SAID, THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 
AND TOOK QUESTION FROM 
REPORTERS FOR OVER AN HOUR. 
BUT HERE'S SORT OF I THINK THE 
HIGHLIGHTS THAT NEED TO BE SORT 
OF TALKED ABOUT. 
ONE, THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING 
THAT HE ACTUALLY MADE NO 
CONCESSIONS, THAT HE WAS JUST 
MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREAN 
DICTATOR. 
BUT THE REALITY IS HE'S 
SUGGESTED TO REPORTERS THERE 
THAT HE WILL STOP THOSE WAR 
GAMES THAT HAVE BEEN ONGOING 
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS ON THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA, HE ALSO 
TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY REMOVING 
TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA, TWO 
HUGE CONCESSIONS ONE WOULD SAY. 
CERTAINLY CHINA AND THE NORTH 
KOREANS BENEFICIARIES IF THE 
PRESIDENT DECIDES TO FOLLOW 
THROUGH. 
THOSE ARE JUST TWO OF THE 
BIGGER HEADLINES THAT I COULD 
SORT OF COME UP WITH, BUT 
THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE 
COULD UNRAVEL, BUT YOUR TAKE. 
>> YEAH. 
AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT THE 
IDEA THAT HE'S INVITED HIM TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS A SIGN OF 
LEGITIMACY AND RESPECT THAT HAS 
NOT BEEN AFFORDED TO OTHER 
WORLD LEADERS AND SERNLT WOULD 
BE A REAL FEATHER IN HIS CAP AS 
WELL. 
AS YOU SAID, LOTS TO UNPACK 
HERE. 
I THINK AMONG OTHER THINGS, 
LET'S JUST SORT OF RUN THROUGH 
IT HERE. 
HE SAYS THAT U.S. SANCTIONS 
WILL REMAIN ON NORTH KOREA -- 
EXISTING U.S. SANCTIONS WILL 
REMAIN ON NORTH KOREA AS THESE 
TALKS CONTINUE AND SUGGESTED 
THAT HE BATTED AWAY A HANDFUL 
OF MORE SANCTIONS BECAUSE IT 
WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL, SAID 
THE U.S. WILL END THE WAR 
GAMES, SAID THAT NORTH KOREA 
WILL BEGIN DESTROYING ITS 
MISSILE TESTING SITES. 
HOW THAT WOULD BE VERIFIED, 
HOWEVER, HE DID NOT SAY OR 
WOULD NOT SHARE. 
THE IDEA THAT THOUSANDS OF 
MISSING PEOPLE FROM THE KOREAN 
CONFLICT WILL BE RETURNED. 
AGAIN, WHETHEROR NOT THEY KNOW 
THAT THOSE THOUSANDS ARE STILL 
WITHIN NORTH KOREA'S BORDERS, 
HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, WHEN 
THAT WOULD HAPPEN WAS UNCLEAR. 
DID SAY THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE 
TWO COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE 
NEXT WEEK, AND BY ROPING IN THE 
SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, THE 
CHINESE, THE JAPANESE 
UNDOUBTEDLY THEY'LL REMAIN 
ENGAGED IN ALL OF THIS AS WELL 
SUGGESTED HE WOULD VISIT 
PYONGYANG AT SOME POINT DOWN 
THE ROAD, AND DID EXTEND THAT 
INVITE TO CHAIRMAN KIM TO VISIT 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
AND ADMITTED DENUCLEARIZATION 
WILL TAKE A LONG TIME, SAYING 
THAT SCIENTIFICALLY HE'S BEEN 
TOLD IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME, 
BUT LATER SUGGESTED IT COULD GO 
PRETTY FAST. 
SO TAKE IT EITHER WAY YOU'D 
LIKE. 
DID SUGGEST THINGS WITH THE G7 
NATIONS DID GO AS BAD AS YOU 
MIGHT THINK, THAT IN FACT THE 
CONVERSATIONS WERE CONSTRUCTIVE 
AND CORDIAL. 
AND IF YOU NEEDED ANY REMINDER 
THAT THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT 
CLOSELY AND CAREFULLY CONSUMES 
THAT THAT IS SAID AND WRITTEN 
BY THE NEWS MEDIA, YOU GOT IT 
YET AGAIN TODAY AS HE RECALLED 
SPECIFIC STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN 
BRITT WRITTEN IN THE PAST BY -- 
BEEN WRITTEN IN THE PAST BY 
VARIOUS REPORTERS THAT WERE 
THERE QUESTIONING HIM. 
VLAD, WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK THIS 
WITH OUR COLLEAGUE MARK WHO 
TRACKS THESE THINGS CLOSELY, I 
CANNOT RECALL SINCE HE BECAME 
PRESIDENT MR. TRUMP TAKING 
QUESTIONS FROM EVERY NEWS 
OUTLET THAT SITS IN THE FRONT 
ROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS 
BRIEFING ROOM, AMONG OTHERS. 
THIS IS A SIGN PERHAPS THAT 
HE'S GOING TO BE MORE WILLING 
TO DO THAT OR PERHAPS JUST 
ASSIGNED THAT ON TODAY, A 
HISTORIC DAY FOR HIM FOR HIS 
ADMINISTRATION, HE'S WILLING TO 
ENGAGE THE PRESS A LITTLE MORE 
THAN USUAL. 
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THE 
PRESIDENT FEELING MUCH MORE 
COMFORTABLE, FEELING THAT HE IS 
IN CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 
OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, OF HIS 
DESTINY, AND THAT IS PERHAPS -- 
AND THAT HAS PERHAPS LED HIM TO 
BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH SOME 
OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PRESS WHO 
IN THE PAST HE HAS NOT CHOSEN 
TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM. 
CBS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 
REPORTER FOR THE AP WHO COVERS 
THE WHITE HOUSE ZEKE MILLER 
JOINS ME ON THE TELEPHONE. 
ZEKE, YOU WERE IN THAT ROOM 
WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS TAKING 
QUESTIONS. 
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS WAS A LONG 
PRESS CONFERENCE, AN HOUR AND 
FIVE MINUTES, YOUR TAKEAWAYS. 
>> THIS EPITOMIZED THE 
PRESIDENT. 
THE PRESIDENT MEETS -- THE 
PRESIDENT ON THE STAGE FOR A 
YEAR AND A HALF, IN AMERICAN 
LIFE FOR THREE YEARS, BEEN IN 
OUR LIVING ROOMS AND TVs FOR 
TWO DECADES. 
THIS IS THE DEAL MAKER THAT 
SAID HE ALONE COULD FIX IT, 
GETTING IN THE ROOM WITH KIM 
JONG-UN, THIS AUTO KRAT AND 
TRYING TO CUT THIS AGREEMENT TO 
BRING BACK THIS INDETRACTABLE 
GLOBAL ISSUE. 
THE QUESTION IS DID HE 
ACCOMPLISH THAT? 
THE DEVIL IS IN DETAILS THERE. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF INDICATIONS 
THAT IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO 
ACCOMPLISH, BUT CERTAINLY FROM 
HIS PUBLIC DEMEANOR HERE IN 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THIS IS 
-- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED THIS -- 
IT SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST 
DAYS IF NOT THE BEST DAY OF HIS 
PRESIDENCY, SORT OF FREE-FORM 
PRESS CONFERENCE, TAKING 
QUESTIONS LIKE HE HASN'T SINCE 
THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MAYBE 
2015, IT FELT HE WAS LOOSE, HE 
WAS HAPPY, COMFORTABLE, FEELING 
LIKE HE WAS -- HE IS REALLY 
CONTROLLING HIS OWN DESTINY 
HERE. 
>> YOU KNOW, ZEKE, I MEAN, 
AGAIN, IF YOU JUST GO BACK AND 
WE WILL OBVIOUSLY OVER THE 
COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF
HOURS BE HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF 
THE STATEMETS THE PRESIDENT 
MADE, SOME OF THE ANSWERS THAT 
HE GAVE TO REPORTERS THERE, 
BUT, AGAIN, THE IDEA THAT THE 
U.S. WILL STOP MILITARY 
EXERCISES ON THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA IN THE REGION, 
PLEDGES TO REMOVE TROOPS AT 
SOME POINT SAYING THEY COST 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, THAT IT'S 
VERY EXPENSIVE, NO NEW 
SANCTIONS IN PLACE, AND ALL WE 
ARE GETTING APPEARS TO BE WHAT 
IS IN THIS DOCUMENT, THIS 
DOCUMENT WHICH IN EFFECT IS A 
VAGUE PROMISE TO DENUCLEARIZE 
AT SOME POINT. 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
YOU KNOW, IF THIS DOCUMENT WERE 
TO BE COMPLETELY AND FULLY 
EXECUTED, TO ITS FULLEST 
CONCLUSION, THIS WOULD BE A 
MASSIVE SUCCESS BY THE 
PRESIDENT. 
IF NORTH KOREA WERE TO GIVE UP 
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HOWEVER 
LONG THAT PROCESS WOULD BE, 
MASSIVE FOREIGN POLICY FOR THIS 
PRESIDENT, NOBODY DISPUTES 
THAT. 
BUT SIGNING A DOCUMENT IS VERY 
DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY 
ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL, AND 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IS 
ELEVATED KIM JONG-UN, ELEVATED 
NORTH KOREA ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE, ENDING 
GENERATIONS OF ISOLATION FOR 
THAT GOVERNMENT, AND MAKING 
SOME KEY SANCTIONS THAT ARE 
GOING TO RANKLE KEY U.S. ALLIES 
AND AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE 
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT SOUTH 
KOREA OBVIOUSLY  
OTHER ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD 
WHO WILL COME TO QUESTION 
WHETHER THEY ARE ASSURANCES BY 
THE UNITED STATES WILL LAST. 
SO FOR THE PRESIDENT -- YOU 
KNOW, IT'LL COME DOWN TO IS IT 
WORTH IT? 
WE HEARD HIM SAY ELEVATING KIM 
ON THE STAGE AND MAKING THOSE 
PROMISES, THOUGH COMMITMENTS 
ARE WORTH IT IF YOU CAN 
ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. 
IF NOT, IN SIX MONTHS, IN SIX 
YEARS, WE MAY BE HAVING A VERY 
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION LOOKING 
BACK AT THIS MOMENT VERY 
DIFFERENT AND THE PRESIDENT 
HINTED AT THAT SAYING HE WOULD 
PROBABLY TRY TO FIND AN EXCUSE, 
SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME IT ON, 
BUT THIS IS A MASSIVE RISK BY 
THIS PRESIDENT AND IT'LL TAKE 
SOME TIME TO SEE IF IT'LL PAY 
OFF OR NOT. 
>> IT ZEKE, STAND BY, ISAAC, 
STAND BY. 
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT 
THIS VERY ISSUE. 
LET'S PLAY THAT. 
>> I WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS 
OUT. 
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 
BACK HOME. 
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 
THEM BACK HOME. 
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY 
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD. 
BUT WE'LL BE SAVING A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. 
PLUS I THINK IT'S VERY 
PROVOCATIVE. 
>> ISAAC, TO YOU NOW. 
WHEN YOU HEARD THAT, THAT I 
THINK WE BOTH LOOKED AT EACH 
OTHER AND SAID THAT WAS 
SOMETHING WE NEVER HEARD WAS 
EVEN ON THE TABLE, THE IDEA OF 
THE UNITED STATES STOPPING 
THESE WAR GAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN 
IN PLAY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. 
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU 
HEARD THAT? 
>> I THINK THROUGHOUT THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE, AND, 
ACTUALLY, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 
NINE-HOUR PERIOD THAT WE'VE 
BEEN WATCHING THIS, I HAVE FELT 
JUST SO SHOCKED, AND THIS HAS 
BEEN SUCH A SURPRISING TURN OF 
EVENTS. 
AND I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 
WHY TRUMP FELT THE NEED TO STOP 
THE WAR GAMES. 
THEY ARE SOMETHING THAT SHOWS 
U.S. RESOLVE IN THE REGION, NOT 
ONLY TO NORTH KOREA, BUT ALSO 
MORE IMPORTANTLY TO CHINA. 
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THIS 
WHOLE IDEA OF TRUMP AS THIS 
GREAT NEGOTIATOR AND YET HE 
GAVE UP ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT CARDS WE HAVE IN THE 
REGION SEEMINGLY FOR FREE. 
SO I THINK I AM BAFFLED BY THAT 
AND I'M BAFFLED BY A LOT OF 
THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF TRUMP'S 
MOUTH. 
>> WE -- WE'VE BEEN ON THE AIR 
FOR ABOUT NINE HOURS NOW, SO I 
DON'T RECALL WHO OF OUR GUESTS, 
MAYBE IT WAS YOU, THAT SAID 
THAT SOMEBODY MENTIONED THOSE 
WAR GAMES AND SAID IT ACTUALLY 
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH NORTH 
KOREA OR WITH CHINA, IT'S 
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 
SOUTH KOREA, THAT'S THE 
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE 
SOUTH KOREANS AND IN SOME 
CASES THE JAPANESE TO CONDUCT 
THESE WAR GAMES, AND YET THE 
PRESIDENT -- IF KIM JONG-UN 
ASKED FOR THIS AND THE 
PRESIDENT GAVE THAT UP FOR SOME 
VAGUE PROMISES TO DENUCLEARIZE 
AT SOME POINT, THE PRESIDENT AT 
ONE POINT WAS ASKED HOW DO YOU 
ENSURE THAT, THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING, WELL, HOW CAN YOU 
ENSURE ANYTHING, IT SEEMED 
REMARKABLE. 
>> RIGHT. 
I THINK HE SAID THAT HOW CAN 
YOU ENSURE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO 
SIT DOWN YOU ACTUALLY SIT DOWN. 
>> YEAH. 
>> AND, AGAIN, YOU KIND OF WANT 
TO THINK, OKAY, WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING THIS FOR SO LONG, WE 
MUST BE HEARING THINGS, BUT I 
THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE 
WAS SAYING AND THE POINT HE WAS 
EXACTLY MAKING ABOUT HOW YOU 
CAN'T ENSURE ANYTHING, AND SO 
THEREFORE WE'RE GOING TO GIVE 
UP THIS REALLY IMPORTANT 
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONSHIP THAT WE 
HAVE AND THIS VERY IMPORTANT 
PART OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 
SOUTH KOREA SO THAT NORTH KOREA 
MAY EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT 
LATER IN THE FUTURE DO 
SOMETHING THEY'VE ALREADY 
PROMISED  TO DO BUT HAVEN'T 
DONE. 
>> ED O'KEEFE, YOU'RE STILL 
WITH US. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU THINK 
HAVING COVERED CONGRESS FOR 
MANY, MANY YEARS, HOW DO YOU 
THINK THIS IS GOING TO PLAY 
WITH SOME CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS, BOTH REPUBLICANS 
AND DEMOCRAT WHO ARE GOING TO 
LOOK AT SOME OF THE REMARKS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE IN THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAY, WHOA, 
WHOA, WHOA, WE -- THE IDEA THAT 
WE WOULD STOP PROTECTING OUR 
ALLIES BY REMOVING TROOPS FROM 
THE PENINSULA OR STOPPING THESE 
WAR GAMES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 
WE THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 
BE SUGGESTING OR EVEN 
ADVOCATING FOR, ALL THAT LOOKS 
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 
THAT WE'RE ABANDONING OUR 
ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA WHILE 
EMBOLDENING THE NORTH KOREANS? 
>> YEAH. 
WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE A FAIR BIT 
OF SKEPTICISM FROM MEMBERS OF 
BOTH PARTIES. 
BUT I THINK WE'LL SEE SOME AT 
LEAST MEASURED SUPPORT FROM 
CERTAIN REPUBLICANS. 
SOME OF HIS BIGGEST DEFENDERS 
ON CAPITOL HILL ARE ALSO SOME 
OF THIS REGIME'S BIGGEST 
CRITICS, THE NORTH KOREAN 
REGIME'S BIGGEST CRITICS. 
I'M THINKING OF ENJOYS LIKE TOM 
COTTON -- LIKE GUYS OF TOM 
COTTON OF ARKANSAS OR OTHER 
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE PRETTY 
OUTSPOKEN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
YOU DID HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY 
HE'D LIKE TO ENGAGE CONGRESS ON 
THAT, WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK 
LIKE, WHEN AND HOW REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN. 
LET ME JUST READ TO YOU A BIT, 
VLAD, FROM A STATEMENT THAT WAS 
PUT OUT LAST NIGHT BY TOP HOUSE 
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE ABOUT AS 
MUCH INFLUENCE OVER THIS AS YOU 
AND I DO, FRANKLY IN THE WAY 
POLITICS WORK IN WASHINGTON 
RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK IT 
SPEAKS BROADLY TO HOW DEMOCRATS 
ARE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT ALL OF 
THIS, AND THEY SAY IN PART, 
SUPPORT FROM OUR PARTNERS AND 
AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS WILL 
BE ESSENTIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL 
OUTCOME TO HIGH-STAKES NUCLEAR 
DIPLOMACY WITH PYONGYANG, A 
DEAL THAT PRESERVES THE STATUS 
QUO IN TERMS OF NORTH KOREA'S 
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY WHILE 
TRADING AWAY OUR ABILITY TO 
COUNTER THEIR NUCLEAR AGGRESS 
AND -- AGGRESSION AND PRO 
TO ACHIEVE AN AGREEMENT THAT 
LEADS TO LASTING PEACE WILL 
REQUIRE THE SUPPORT OF OUR 
ALLIES. 
IN ESSENCE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 
HERE IS WE'RE COOL WITH THIS IF 
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS COOL 
WITH THIS. 
AND IF THEY AREN'T, WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE A LOT OF SKEPTICISM. 
I SUSPECT IN THE COMING DAYS 
THERE WILL BE SOME BRIEFINGS 
FOR AT LEAST SENIOR LAWMAKERS 
TO LEARN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT 
THE DETAILS OF THIS, ABOUT THE 
PATH FORWARD AND POTENTIALLY 
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT AND 
SECRETARY POMPEO'S DIRECT 
INTERACTIONS WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 
AND HIS CLOSE-KNIT CIRCLE, AND 
SO WE MAY START TO LEARN A 
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT IN THE 
COMING DAYS. 
I WOULD ONLY ADD TO WHAT 
ISAAC'S CONCERN WAS THERE ABOUT 
THE WAR GAMES. 
YOU KNOW, I THINK AS MUCH AS WE 
ARE SKEPTICAL THAT THE NORTH 
KOREANS ARE GOING TO DO ANY OF 
THIS, WE PROBABLY SHOULD BE 
JUST AS SKEPTICAL THAT WE WOULD 
EVER REALLY CONSIDER DOING 
THOSE THINGS UNTIL WE SEE SOME 
VERIFIABLE ACTION BY THE NORTH 
 
PICKING UP THE PHONE TO SPEAK 
NEXT WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN -- 
WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, 
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS YOU CAN 
BET THAT THAT PHONE CALL WILL 
INCLUDE IS A QUESTION ABOUT, 
WAIT, WE'RE ENDING THOSE WAR 
GAMES? 
THAT'S PART OF OUR DEAL, NOT 
PART OF YOUR DEAL WITH THEM. 
SO I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT THERE 
WILL BE -- THERE WOULD BE A 
WHILE AT LEAST UNTIL THAT IS 
COMPLETELY TAKEN OFF THE TABLE. 
AND AS I RECALL, ISAAC, THOSE 
ARE ANNUAL WAR GAMES, RIGHT? 
THEY'RE NOT ONGOING. 
>> THERE ARE ANNUAL ONES. 
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER 
EXERCISES THAT THE UNITED 
STATES AND SOUTH KOREA DOES. 
I THINK THE ONES -- THERE'S 
PARTICULAR EXERCISES THAT THE 
NORTH KOREANS HAVE THE LARGEST 
PROBLEM WITH. 
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM 
REALLY SHOULD OR NEED TO BE ON 
THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATE UNLESS, 
AS YOU WERE SAYING, WE ARE 
GETTING CONCRETE DELIVERABLES 
FROM THE NORTH KOREANS, AND I 
THINK THAT'S A GOOD POINT. 
I THINK THE SOUTH KOREAN 
PRESIDENT, I THINK ALSO 
SECRETARY MATTIS AND OTHER 
MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S CABINET ARE 
GOING TO TRY TO WALK HIM BACK 
FROM A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT 
HE SAID IN THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
ISAAC, STAND BY. 
ONE SECOND. 
ED, STAND BY. 
I WANT TO GO STRAIGHT TO "CBS 
EVENING NEWS" ANCHOR JEFF GLOR 
WHO IS JOINING ME NOW FROM 
SINGAPORE WHERE HE HAS BEEN 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS 
TRACKING THIS HISTORIC MEETING 
BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG-
UN. 
JEFF, REMARKABLE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THERE BY THE 
PRESIDENT, OVER AN HOUR AND 
FIVE MINUTES TAKING QUESTIONS 
FROM REPORTERS. 
>>REPORTER:  YES, AN EXHAUSTIVE 
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST 
WATCHED, AND NOW THE PRESIDENT 
PREPARES TO DEPART ON AIR FORCE 
ONE, KIM JONG-UN HAS ALREADY 
DEPARTED HERE. 
SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT 
OF -- THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A 
LOT OF INSTANT ANALYSIS HERE, A 
LOT OF HAND WRINGING. 
I THINK BOTTOM LINE AT THIS 
POINT RIGHT NOW THERE IS THIS 
FRAMEWORK WHICH HAS BEEN 
SIGNED, THESE FOUR MAIN POINTS, 
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. 
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT 
SOMETHING HAPPENING NOW NEXT 
WEEK. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
BEING ASKED ABOUT WHEN KIM JONG-
UN POTENTIALLY VISITS THE 
UNITED STATES, WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD POTENTIALLY 
VISIT PYONGYANG, BUT WE HAVE TO 
WAIT ON THOSE DETAILS, VLAD. 
>> JEFF, TALK ABOUT THE -- IF 
WE TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST 
WITNESSED WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND MEMBERS 
OF THE PRESS, THIS HISTORIC 
MEETING THAT WE SAW UNFOLDING 
BEFORE OUR EYES HERE, AND YOU 
SAW FROM THE GROUND THERE IN 
SINGAPORE, THE FIRST-EVER 
MEETING BETWEEN A SITTING 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND A 
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AND 
ULTIMATELY COMING AWAY WITH A 
SIGNED JOINT AGREEMENT, JUST 
THE HISTORY IN THE MAKING THAT 
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
LAST NINE HOURS OR SO. 
>> YEAH. 
I THINK THERE WERE A COUPLE 
THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO. 
AS FAR AS LAST NIGHT GOES, 
THERE WAS -- YES, THERE WAS THE 
THEATER OF WHAT HAPPENED, THERE 
WAS WHAT WE SAW FROM THESE TWO 
MEN, THE MULTIPLE HANDSHAKES, 
THAT RELATIONSHIP -- BECAUSE 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT 
IT SO MUCH, BECAUSE HE HAS SAID 
HE FEELS LIKE THAT IS SO 
IMPORTANT, THAT POTENTIAL 
CONNECTION AND HOW THAT 
HAPPENS, ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S 
THE MEETING LAST NIGHT. 
AND THEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THE 
LANGUAGE IN THE FRAMEWORK WE 
SEE HERE NOW. 
DOES IT SAY COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION? 
YES, IT DOES. 
IS THE WORD VERIFIABLE IN 
THERE? 
NO. 
AS FAR AS THE SEQUENCE OF THE 
POINTS GOES, SOME HAVE NOTED 
ALREADY THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD 
HAVE PREFERRED AND GOT THAT. 
WE TALK ABOUT THESE FIRST TWO 
POINTS FIRST TALKING ABOUT A 
STABLE FUTURE, PEACE, A PEACE 
REGIME ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, 
THOSE ARE THE FIRST COUPLE 
POINTS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND 
THEN IT MOVES DOWN TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND THEN 
THERE'S THE FOURTH PINT WHICH 
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SO MANY IN 
THE U.S. AND THAT IS THE RETURN 
OF THESE POW/MIA REMAINS. 
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED AT THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS A 
LAST MINUTE ADDITION, BUT IT'S 
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN 
TALKED ABOUT BETWEEN THESE TWO 
SIDES FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. 
>> "CBS EVENING NEWS" ANCHOR 
JEFF GLOR REPORTING TO US FROM 
SINGAPORE. 
JEFF, WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 
REPORTING ON "CBS THIS MORNING" 
AND LATER TONIGHT ON "THE CBS 
EVENING NEWS." 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> THANKS, VLAD. 
>> LET'S BRING BACK ZEKE 
MILLER, A WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE A.P. 
HE'S JOINING ME ON THE PHONE 
FROM SINGAPORE. 
SO, ZEKE, THE PRESIDENT ON HIS 
WAY BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, 
WE KNOW THAT CHAIRMAN KIM HAS 
ALREADY DEPARTED SINGAPORE, 
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS, THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING HE'S GOING TO 
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK, HE'S BEEN 
UP FOR 25 HOURS, HE DESERVES A 
BREAK AFTER THIS HISTORIC 
MEETING, BUT THERE WILL BE 
QUESTIONS AND THERE WILL BE 
FOLLOWUPS, ESPECIALLY TO THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
AT THE END OF HIS REMARKS HERE 
THE PRESIDENT POINTING TO HIS 
SECRETARY OF STATE SAYING, 
LOOK, YOU GOTTA GET THAT BALL 
OVER THE FINISH LINE. 
>> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
AND THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION WE 
WERE TALKING FOR THE LAST 
SEVERAL HOURS NOW SINCE THIS 
DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED AND WE 
STARTED LEARNING WHAT WAS IN 
IT. 
REALLY, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL 
THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS AGREED 
TO, WHAT WILL HE ACTUALLY 
IMPLEMENT, YOU KNOW, THIS VERY 
LIMITED BROAD AGREEMENT, AND 
THAT WILL BE UP TO, AS THE 
PRESIDENT SAID, MIKE POMPEO AND 
OTHER NEGOTIATORS WILL BEGIN 
MEETING NEXT WEEK, WHAT WILL 
THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE. 
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
HINTED THAT HE WAS LOOKING TO 
SEE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA JOIN 
THESE TALKS IN SOME FORM OR 
FASHION. 
WILL OTHERS BE BROUGHT IN? 
WHAT WILL THE NATURE -- HOW 
OFTEN WILL THEY MEET? 
WILL THERE BE CERTAIN 
TIMETABLES FOR THESE 
DELIVERABLES TO BE MET? 
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ANY OF 
THAT RIGHT NOW. 
IF ANYTHING, THAT'S WHAT WE 
WERE LOOKING TO HEAR OUT OF THE 
SUMMIT, IT WAS A TIMETABLE 
STRUCTURE FOR SOME OF THOSE 
TALKS AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE 
OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVEN'T 
QUITE LEARNED YET. 
MAYBE WE WILL LEARN THAT WHILE 
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING BACK TO 
THE UNITED STATES. 
AND THEN ALSO WILL THERE BE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME OF THESE 
-- WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 
CALLING THE QUESTION OF THE 
NATURE OF THESE ALLIANCES WHEN 
IT COMES TO THE WAR GAMES, HIS 
PRESIDENT WITH PRESIDENT -- HIS 
CONVERSATION COMING UP WITH 
PRESIDENT MOON JUST A BIT. 
WILL THERE BE ALLIANCE FROM THE 
REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD IN 
THE WAY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
CONDUCTED THESE NEGOTIATIONS, 
THT'S SOMETHING WE'LL BE 
WATCHING OBVIOUSLY VERY CLOSELY 
AT OVER THE HOURS AND WEEKS. 
>> ZEKE, I HOPE YOU CAN STAND 
BY. 
ED IS STILL WITH US AS WELL 
FROM OUR WASHINGTON BUREAU AND 
ISAAC IS HERE ON THE SET WITH 
ME. 
ED, TO YOU FIRST, AND, ISAAC, 
I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME THING. 
THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
WAS ASKED BY I THINK A MEMBER 
OF THE FOREIGN PRESS, I DON'T 
THINK IT WAS AN AMERICAN 
REPORTER WHO VERY POINTEDLY 
ASKED PRESIDENT TRUMP THE 
QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN ASKED BY 
ANALYSTS AND PUNDITS LEADING UP 
TO THIS HISTORIC MEETING WHICH 
IS BY MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN 
ARE YOU PROVIDING LEGITIMACY TO 
HIS REGIME? 
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
REFUSING TO ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION, MAYBE BECAUSE HE FELT 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE IT 
WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE U.S. 
PRESS, BUT THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED 
IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD AS 
WE LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT THAT 
WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND CHAIRMAN KIM. 
THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT, 
FOR EXAMPLE, AT ONE POINT 
SAYING TO A QUESTION FROM 
ANOTHER REPORTER SAYING THAT 
ONE OF THE GREAT WINNERS FROM 
THIS MEETING ARE THE GROUP OF 
NORTH KOREANS WHO ARE FORCED TO 
LABOR IN GULAGS, THE PRESIDENT 
SAYING THEY ARE ONE OF THE 
GREAT WINNERS AS A GROUP. 
I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE 
-- I KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL JUST 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES OUT OF THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT THERE'S 
GOING TO BE A PARSING OF HIS 
WORDS, AND WORDS DO MATTER 
BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
>> YEAH. 
AND I THINK PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS MIGHT HAVE PUT 
MORE EMPHASIS ON THAT QUESTION 
AND VERIFYING THAT THINGS ARE 
IMPROVING WHEN IT COMES TO 
HUMAN RIGHTS ALONGSIDE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
YOU KNOW, HE ALSO SUGGESTED AT 
ONE POINT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DID 
COME UP. 
REMEMBER GOING INTO THIS 
MEETING WE WERE TOLD BY I 
BELIEVE SECRETARY POMPEO AND 
OTHER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS 
WOULD NOT BE ON THE AGENDA. 
THEY MAY HAVE JUST SAID THAT 
PUBLICLY SO AS TO KEEP THE 
NORTH KOREANS FROM BACKING OUT 
AT THE LAST MINUTE AND MAYBE IT 
CAME UP IN THE MEETING, MAYBE 
IT DIDN'T COME UP IN THE 
MEETING. 
AND UNTIL WE GET SOME KIND OF 
VERIFICATION OF THAT, I THINK 
IT'S PROPER TO PERHAPS BE A BIT 
SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 
STATEMENT THERE THAT IT DID 
INDEED GET DISCUSSED. 
YEAH, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE A 
MAIN TOPIC OF CONCERN AMONG THE 
PRESIDENT'S TOP CRITICS, NOT 
ONLY IN SORT OF FOREIGN POLICY 
OF THE WORLD, BUT I WOULD THINK 
ON CAPITOL HILL LATER TODAY 
THERE WILL START TO BE SOME 
CONCERN THAT, HEY, MAYBE WE'RE 
GOING DOWN THE PATH TOO QUICKLY 
WITH THEM ON THIS AND NOT ALSO 
DISCUSSING THE FACT THAT 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NORTH 
KOREANS ARE IN FORCED LABOR 
CAMPS, THAT OTHERS HAVE BEEN 
KILLED WITH NO APPARENT REASON 
AND QUITE GRUESOMELY, AND THAT, 
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 
CLEARLY HAS A TOTAL GRIP ON HIS 
COUNTRY AND NO SENSE OF 
DEMOCRACY. 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO 
ASKED AT ONE POINT DO YOU HAVE 
A MODEL FOR WHAT A FUTURE NORTH 
KOREA MIGHT LOOK LIKE, AND HE 
SAID, WELL, THAT'LL BE UP TO 
THE NORTH KOREANS TO DECIDE 
WHICH IS A DEFT DIPLOMATIC 
STATEMENT BECAUSE YOU DON'T 
WANT TO BE DICTATE WHAG ANOTHER 
COUNTRY DOES NECESSARILY. 
BUT, AGAIN, I THINK SOME OF HIS 
PREDECESSORS MIGHT HAVE SAID 
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, 
BUT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY'LL 
ADOPT SOME SENSE OR SOME 
DEMOCRATIC NORMS AND BECOME A 
FREER SOCIETY. 
SO PERHAPS AN OPPORTUNITY 
MISSED THERE. 
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS 
BEEN PRETTY LASER FOCUSED ON 
THE IDEA OF DENUCLEARIZATION 
FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
LATER. 
>> ED, STAND BY. 
I WANT TO BRING IN DUYNG KIM, 
SHE'S AT THE PENINSULA FUTURE 
FORUM, SHE IS IN SINGAPORE. 
YOU WATCHED THESE EVENTS UNFOLD 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS 
HOURS CULMINATING IN THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE 
HISTORIC MEETING AND THEN SOME 
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ANSWERED, WHAT YOU 
THOUGHT OF HIS RESPONSES TO 
REPORTERS' QUESTIONS. 
>>REPORTER: 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, VLAD. 
WELL, ON THE SUMMIT ITSELF, THE 
MEETING ITSELF, THE THEATRICS 
WERE THERE, THE ATMOSPHERE WAS 
THERE, AT LEAST THE PUBLIC 
VIDEO CLIPS THAT WE'VE SEEN OF 
THEM, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
DISCUSSION WAS LIKE IN PRIVATE, 
BUT ON THE SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL, 
THE JOINT STATEMENT AND THE 
ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS DURING 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY 
LEAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS THAN 
ANSWERS. 
DID THEY AGREE ON WHAT 
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS? 
DID THEY AGREE ON A TIMETABLE? 
IT SOUNDS LIKE BASED ON THE 
JOINT STATEMENT THEY DID NOT, 
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT 
SECRETARY POMPEO IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO NEGOTIATE GOING 
FORWARD. 
ONE KEY ISSUE THAT STOOD OUT 
FOR ME DURING THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE WAS THE MENTIONING 
OF U.S. TROOPS ON THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA AND THE JOINT 
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH 
AMERICAN ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA. 
NOW, HE FIRST ANSWERED THE 
QUESTION AS SAYING, NO, WE'RE 
NOT REDUCING TROOPS ON THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA WHICH IS 
REASSURING TO BOTH SOUTH KOREA 
AND JAPANESE ALLIES, BUT THEN 
HE SAID HE WANTS TO WITHDRAW 
ALL HIS TROOPS AT SOME POINT, 
AND THAT IS A BIG MISTAKE. 
THE TROOPS ARE THERE TO 
MAINTAIN STABILITY AND SECURITY 
IN THE REGION. 
IT'S NOT JUST IN SOUTH KOREA, 
IT'S THE REGION AS A WHOLE. 
HE IS WRONG WHEN HE SAYS THAT 
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO KEEP 
TROOPS THERE. 
IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO 
BRING THEM HOME. 
THE OTHER ISSUE IS I HAD WAS HE 
ANSWERED A QUESTION SAYING THAT 
THE WAR GAMES -- HE CALLS THEM 
WAR GAMES WILL BE DISCONTINUED, 
WILL BE CANCELED, AND THAT 
CONCERNS ME. 
DID HE MEAN THE JOINT MILITARY 
EXERCISES, THE DEFENSIVE 
DRILLS, OR DID HE MEAN THE 
BOMBERS AND THE STRATEGIC 
ASSETS THAT ARE MORE 
PROVOCATIVE IN THE DRILLS? 
IF IT'S THE FORMER, IF IT'S THE 
ENTIRE EXERCISES, THIS IS ALSO 
A BIG MISTAKE. 
THESE ARE DEFENSIVE IN NATURE, 
THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW THEY 
ARE, THEY KNOW WHEN THEY 
HAPPEN, AND IT REALLY IS -- 
IT'S JUST LIKE DROPPING YOUR 
SHIELD, YOUR DEFENSIVE SHIELD 
IN FRONT OF A DRAWN SWORD AND 
THAT DRAWN SWORD IS NORTH 
KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
UNTIL NORTH KOREA GETS RID OF 
THE NUKE WEAPONS, THESE 
MILITARY EXERCISES SHOULD NOT 
BE STOPPED. 
>> DEYEON KIM JOINING US FROM 
SINGAPORE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
ANALYSIS. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 
>>>  "FACE THE NATION" 
MODERATOR AND SENIOR AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT MARGARET BRENNAN 
IS JOINING ME NOW HERE AT THE 
TABLE. 
MARGARET, A REMARKABLE SERIES 
OF EVENTS UNFOLDING OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS 
CULMINATING IN THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND WHAT 
MANY PEOPLE ARE CALLING 
CONCESSIONS. 
LET'S FACE IT, WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID, WHAT DEYEON KIM 
JUST SAID, REMOVING TROOPS AT 
SOME POINT FROM THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA, STOPPING THE WAR 
GAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN DEFENSIVE 
IN NATURE, THEREFORE TO THE 
BENEFIT OF SOUTH KOREA, WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE OF THOSE RESPONSE? 
>> WELL, IT WILL BE INTERESTING 
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY 
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE 
AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED THAT 
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATEMENT 
THAT WAS RELEASED BECAUSE THE 
STATEMENT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN 
THAT THE PRESS SECRETARY HANDED 
TO US WAS ALL VERY GENERAL. 
IT WAS PLEDGE OF FUTURE ACTION, 
IT WAS A DESCRIPTION OF WHERE 
THEY WANT TO GO, A ROAD MAP, A 
FRAMEWORK, ALL OF THAT CAN BE 
PULLED BACK VERY QUICKLY. 
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS, LOOK, 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY 
BELIEVES REGARDLESS OF POLITICS 
THIS IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE 
IN TERMS OF THE THREAT TO U.S. 
TERRITORY. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA BEFORE THE 
PRESIDENT WAS INAUGURATED SAID 
THIS WILL BE YOUR NUMBER ONE 
CHALLENGE. 
SO GIVING THE PRESIDENT HIS DUE 
THAT HE GOT TO THIS POINT TO 
EVEN BEGIN TO ENGAGE 
DIPLOMATICALLY WHEN HIS 
PREFERRED OPTION AT FIRST 
GLANCE HAD BEEN MILITARILY IS 
SOMETHING, BUT IT IS REALLY 
GOING TO BE IN THE DETAILS IN 
TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY 
NEGOTIATE AT THAT MEETING NEXT 
WEEK, THAT JOHN BOLTON, THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE WILL HAVE 
WITH THE NORTH KOREANS AND IN 
THE FUTURE. 
I MEAN, THIS IS THE BEGINNING 
OF A PROCESS. 
IT TOOK ABOUT TWO YEARS OF 
NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN TO GET 
THE AGREEMENT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DESCRIBED AS 
IMPERFECT AND TORE UP. 
THAT WAS TWO YEARS WITH A 
COUNTRY THAT DID NOT HAVE THE 
TYPE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM 
THAT NORTH KOREA HAS. 
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
SOMETHING THAT POTENTIALLY GOES 
BEYOND THE, YOU KNOW, FIRST 
TERM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, IF IT 
WORKS MAY NOT SEE FULL 
DISMANTLEMENT INTO THE SECOND 
TERM, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT 
BEHIND THE SCENES THEY'VE BEEN 
WORKING VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO 
GET OUR PARTNERS, OTHER NUCLEAR 
POWERS TO CHIP IN, TO FIGURE 
OUT HOW THEY CAN POOL RESOURCES 
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN MORE 
QUICKLY THAN ESTIMATES. 
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY IT 
WON'T TAKE 15 YEARS. 
THEY WANT IT TO HAPPEN IN A 
SHORTER DURATION OF TIME, BUT 
TO ACTUALLY DISMANTLE NUKES, 
NONE OF THAT WAS PROMISED 
TODAY. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
CRITICAL, AS YOU KNOW, OF THE 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND THERE WAS 
A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF 
THE PRESIDENT, LOOK, IF YOU 
DON'T GET AT LEAST WHAT 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS AIBLG TO 
GET WITH IRAN -- WAS ABLE TO 
GET WITH IRAN, THAT WAS DAVID 
SANGER, I BELIEVE, OF THE "NEW 
YORK TIMES," THAT'S A FAILURE. 
>> RIGHT 
>> DO YOU AGREE? 
>> WELL, DAVID AND I SPENT A 
LOT OF TIME IN VIENNA COVERING 
THESE NUCLEAR TALK WITH IRAN, 
YES, THAT THE BENCHMARK THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SET FOR HIMSELF 
AND HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. 
REMEMBER, MIKE POMPEO BEFORE HE 
WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS A 
CONGRESSMAN FROM KANSAS WHO 
RAISED HOLY HELL ABOUT THE IRAN 
NUCLEAR DEAL. 
HE TRIED TO STOP IT. 
AND SO HE'S GOT -- HE'S SET FOR 
HIMSELF A CHALLENGING SET OF 
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE. 
LOOK, THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, 
WHAT DID THEY GET? 
THEY GOT IRAN TO SHIP OUT 97% 
OF THEIR ENRICHED URANIUM. 
THEY GOT THEM TO DESTROY 
THOUSAND FS CENTRIFUGES. 
THEY GOT THEM TO FREEZE A 
PROGRAM NO WHERE NEAR NORTH 
KOREA'S IS. 
WHAT THEY DIDN'T GET, THEY 
DIDN'T GET A HALT TO BALLISTIC 
MISSILE TESTING. 
REMEMBER ONE OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S COMPLAINTS  ABOUT THIS 
DEAL THAT THEY COULD STILL FIRE 
OFF MISSILES. 
THEY DIDN'T GET THAT. 
NOW THE PRESIDENT HAS SET 
MISSILES ON HIS AGENDA FOR 
NORTH KOREA. 
THEY DIDN'T GET ACCESS TO ALL 
MILITARY BASES. 
THEY DID GET SNAP INSPECTIONS 
IN IRAN. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER COMPLAINT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT. 
THAT MEANS IN NORTH KOREA HE'S 
GOT TO BE TIEBL GET KIM JONG-UN 
TO SAY HAVE AT IT, LET YOUR 
INSPECTORS WANDER AROUND MY 
COUNTRY, INCLUDING INTO SOME OF 
THE MOST SECRET MILITARY BASES 
TO SEE IF I HAVE A NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM. 
THAT WASN'T AGREED TO TODAY. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE 
TO COME IN THE FUTURE. 
THAT TAKES TIME. 
THAT TAKES TRUST TO BE ABLE TO 
GET. 
AND IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO 
GET THERE WITH IRAN. 
WE WILL SEE WHERE THEY GO WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
BUT THIS IS A STARTING POINT, 
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR SOMETHING 
THAT -- EVERYTHING IS 
POLITICIZED THESE DAYS, IF THEY 
CAN MAKE THIS WORK, IT WILL BE 
A WIN FOR THE WORLD, AT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID. 
IT'S A WORLD PROBLEM, HE'S NOT 
WRONG ON THAT. 
>> A LOT OF PEOPLE WONDERED HOW 
WE GOT TO THIS POINT, HOW WE 
GOT TO THE POINT WHERE A 
SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT WOULD 
MEET WITH A NORTH KOREAN 
DICTATOR. 
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID WHY HE 
CHOSE TO MAKE THIS AN 
IMPERATIVE. 
LET'S PLAY THAT. 
>> FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE, 
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 
MINE. 
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 
DAY. 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH 
KOREA. 
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 
VAIN. 
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS, 
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 
>> AND THE PRESIDENT THERE, 
MARGARET, SAYING THAT THIS ALL 
SORT OF BEGAN WITH OTTO, AT 
LEAST AS FAR AS WHERE WE ARE 
TODAY, AND WE TALKED ABOUT ALL 
THROUGHOUT THIS COVERAGE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A CHANGE 
AGENT, HE'S A DISRUPTER, THAT'S 
WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS WANT FROM 
HIM, THAT'S WHAT HE'S 
DELIVERING. 
AND YET THERE ARE SEEMINGLY 
MOMENTS DURING THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE SPECIFICALLY WHERE 
HE SEEMED TO INDICATE, FOR 
EXAMPLE, WHEN THEY SAID, WELL, 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
VERIFY THIS? 
AND IT'S BECAUSE I TRUST 
CHAIRMAN KIM. 
AT ONE POINT SAYING HOW CAN YOU 
ENSURE ANYTHING? 
I THINK AS WE GO BACK AND WE 
LOOK AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 
THERE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE 
QUESTIONS  ABOUT HOW THIS 
NEGOTIATION TAKES PLACE, 
BECAUSE GIVEN THE PRESIDENT IS 
A CHANGE AGENT, THIS USUALLY 
HAPPENS AT THE END. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> IN OTHER WORDS, SECRETARY 
POMPEO AND OTHER DIPLOMAT, 
BOLTON AND THE OTHERS, THEY 
HAMMER OUT ALL THESE 
AGREEMENTS, THEN THE PRESIDENT 
MEETS WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH 
KOREA AND WE COME AWAY WITH AN 
AGREEMENT AND A FRAMEWORK IN 
PLACE. 
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. 
>> RIGHT. 
AND TO BE FAIR, EVEN THOSE WHO 
WERE IN HIGH NATIONAL SECURITY 
POSITIONS IN THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING THE 
FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE JIM CLAPPER WHO IS 
NO FAN OF THIS PRESIDENT HAS 
SAID I GIVE HIM CREDIT ON THIS 
BECAUSE HE ADVOCATED, LOOK, 
YOU'VE GOTTA ENGAGE. 
AND IN A COUNTRY IN NORTH KOREA 
YOU DON'T HAVE BUREAUCRACIES 
AND PROFESSIONAL DIPLOMATS 
EMPOWERED IN THE WAY YOU MIGHT 
HAVE IN OTHER COUNTRIES THAT 
REALLY IN SOME WAYS THE ONLY 
PERSON WHO MATTERS IN TERMS OF 
DECISION MAKING IS THE GUY AT 
THE TOP, KIM JONG-UN. 
REMEMBER, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, 
YES, IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE 
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD, 
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, HE'S 
SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO MURDERED HIS 
FAMILY MEMBERS. 
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S CARRIED OUT 
MASS SOME WOULD SAY GENOCIDE, 
CERTAINLY MASS KILLING OF HIS 
OWN PEOPLE, STARVATION, LABOR 
CAMPS, GULAGS. 
SO THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS 
TOTALITARIAN IN POWER. 
HE'S THE PERSON YOU'LL HAVE TO 
SIT AWAY FROM. 
THE U.S. HAS BROKERED DEALS 
WITH BRUTAL MURDERERS IN THE 
PAST WHEN IT HAS SERVED THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS, 
AND THAT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS TRYING TO DO TODAY. 
IT IS A HUGE DIPLOMATIC GAMBLE, 
AND IT IS INTERESTING THAT HE'S 
WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. 
AS YOU SAY, IF PEOPLE -- AS YOU 
SAY, THE PEOPLE WEREN'T WILLING 
TO IN THE PAST. 
IT'S NOW GOING TO BE ALL IN THE 
DETAILS. 
THAT'S WHY JOURNALISTS WILL 
CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE, 
ANALYSTS WILL CONTINUE TO PICK 
APART THESE DETAILS, NOT 
NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF ANY KIND 
OF POLITICS, BUT BECAUSE THIS 
HAS TO BE FLAWLESS IN EXECUTION 
FOR THIS GAMBLE TO PAY OFF. 
AND WHAT WE HAVE HEARD BEHIND 
THE SCENES IS THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND OTHERS HAVE SAID, 
LOOK, IF WE CAN JUST GET 
INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, IF WE 
CAN JUST GET THEM TO OPEN UP 
THE DOOR, LET OUR PEOPLE IN 
THERE, HAVE EYES ON, EARS ON, 
WALK AROUND SOME OF THESE SITES 
AND GET A GOOD SENSE OF THINGS 
BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A BLACK BOX, 
WE KNEW FAR MORE ABOUT IRAN AND 
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAN WE 
KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA BECAUSE 
OF OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION, 
BECAUSE OF SO MUCH OVER TIME. 
NORTH KOREA WE KNOW FAR LESS, 
AND WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM 
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS 
FROM THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION, 
FROM THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
SAY, LOOK, IN THE PAST WHEN WE 
HAVE GOTTEN INSPECTORS IN THERE 
-- REMEMBER, THEY DID COME IN 
UNDER THAT 1994 AGREEMENT? 
>> I REMEMBER. 
>> AND THEY WERE THROWN OUT IN 
THE BUSH ERA WHEN THEY POINTED 
OUT THEY WERE CHEATING, THEY 
úG 
FOUND FAR MORE THAN WE EVER 
THOUGHT, AND THEY WERE 
ENRICHING AND DOING THINGS MORE 
AND BEYOND WHAT THE U.S. HAD 
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 
SO IF THEY CAN AT LEAST GET IN 
THERE AND VERIFY, AND IT WAS 
OUR MAJOR DWAIRT WHO ASKED 
ABOUT -- MAJOR GARRETT WHO 
ASKED ABOUT THAT, THE PRESIDENT 
WAS VAGUE, AS YOU SAY, BUT 
THAT'S WHEN IT'S GOING TO COME 
DOWN TO POMPEO AND BOLTON 
WORKING OUT HOW THIS WORKS AND 
BOLTON, SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT 
HIS PAST COMMENTS IN POLITICS, 
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S A -- WHO 
HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN ARMS 
CONTROL. 
>> WE'VE GOT JUST ABOUT TWO 
MINUTES LEFT, MARGARET, TO TALK 
ABOUT THIS. 
YOU POINT OUT THAT MAJOR DID 
ASK ABOUT THE VERIFYING OF -- 
AND HAVING INSPECTORS AND THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING, YEAH, YEAH, 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE, 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
COMBINATION EVERY AMERICANS AND 
PERHAPS OTHERS, WHY NOT PUT 
THAT IN THE AGREEMENT THAT WE 
HAVE TODAY? 
AT LEAST SOMETHING CONCRETE? 
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING 
RIGHT NOW IS A LOT OF PEOPLE 
SAYING THIS THING IS VAGUE AND 
THE NORTH KOREANS, EVERY FOUR 
OF THOSE BULLET POINTS HAVE 
BEEN PROMISED IN 1994 AND AGAIN 
IN 2000. 
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING 
THEY HAVEN'T IRONED OUT. 
WE KNOW THE U.S. HAS PUT 
TOGETHER THEIR SORT OF DREAM 
TEAM THAT THEY WANT TO SEE WITH 
INSPECTORS AND PEOPLE WITH 
EXPERIENCE IN NUCLEAR POWER. 
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING JUST 
ANYONE CAN DO, RIGHT? 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BUILD A 
NUCLEAR WEAPON, TO KNOW HOW TO 
TAKE IT APART. 
AND THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF 
SCIENTISTS WHO CAN DO THAT. 
SO THE U.S. HAS BEEN PUTTING 
TOGETHER ALLIES, THE U.K., 
OTHERS HAVE OFFERED RESOURCES. 
SOME OF OUR ADVERSARIES, 
RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY'VE GOT 
EXPERIENCE WITH THAT. 
WE WANT THEM IN ON THIS. 
HAVING THOSE PEOPLE IN THERE IS 
SOMETHING THAT NORTH KOREA HAS 
TO AGREE TO, AND SO THEY MAY BE 
ABLE TO SAY, OH, YES TO THE 
AMERICAN, NO TO THE FRENCH. 
YES TO THE CHINESE, NO TO THE 
RUSSIANS, ALL THAT STUFF HAS TO 
BE NEGOTIATED. 
AND THAT IS WHERE IT CAN GET 
MESSY. 
KIM JONG-UN CAN DRAW THIS OUT 
FOR AS LONG AS HE WANTS. 
AND THAT IS THE RISK WITH 
DIPLOMACY, IT IS NOT WITHOUT A 
PRICE. 
>> INDEED. 
"FACE THE NATION" MODERATOR, 
OUR SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT, THANKS FOREIGN 
COMING DOWN TO BREAK THIS DOWN 
WITH US. 
ED O'KEEFE, GREAT TO HAVE YOU 
ON CBSN. 
>>>  WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A 
QUICK BREAK. 
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HAVE A 
LOT MORE COVERAGE AT THE TOP OF 
THE HOUR. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, CBS 
NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>> HI, EVERYONE, I'M VLADAMIR 
DUTHIERS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR 
JOINING US. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN 
HAVE WRAPPED UP THEIR HISTORIC 
SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE. 
IT ENDED WITH AN 
IMPROMPTUDOCUMENT SIGNING WHERE 
BOTH SIDES AGREED TO COOPERATE 
TO ACHIEVE PEACE. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER HAS ACCEPTED AN 
INVITATION TO THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND THE U.S. WILL STOP 
CONDUCTING WAR GAMES WITH SOUTH 
KOREA. 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE ON 
THAT IN JUST A MOMENT. 
FIRST LET'S LOOK HOW IT ALL 
UNFOLDED. 
THE PAIR SHOOK HANDS AT THE 
CAPELLA HOTEL ON SENTOSA ISLAND 
ON TUESDAY. 
THEY GREETED EACH OTHER ON A 
BACKDROP OF AMERICAN AND NORTH 
KOREAN FLAGS. 
A FEW MOMENTS LATER WE HEARD 
FROM BOTH OF THEM FOR THE FIRST 
TIME. 
>> I FEEL GREAT. 
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
GREAT DISCUSSION AND TREMENDOUS 
SUCCESS, WE'LL BE TREUMEDLY 
SUCCESSFUL. 
>> THE PRESIDENT WENT ON TO SAY 
AFTER THOSE COMMENTS THAT HE 
BELIEVES THEY WILL HAVE, QUOTE, 
A TRAFFIC RELATIONSHIP. 
KIM JONG-UN FOR HIS PART SAID, 
QUOTE, IT WAS NOT QUZ TO GET 
HERE. 
THEY WENT ON TO HOLD A ONE-ON-
ONE MEETING AND A WORKING LUNCH 
WITH TOP ADVISERS. 
THE PAIR THEN WALKED OUTSIDE 
THE CAPELLA HOTEL AND THAT IS 
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE TO 
REPORTERS FOR A BRIEF MOMENT. 
>> IT'S GOING GREAT. 
WE HAD A REALLY FANTASTIC 
MEETING. 
, A LOT OF PROGRESS, REALLY 
VERY POSITIVE, I THINK BETTER 
THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE 
EXPECTED. 
TOP OF THE LINE. 
REALLY GOOD. 
WE'RE GOING RIGHT NOW FOR A 
SIGNING. 
>>REPORTER:  WHAT ARE YOU GOING 
TO SIGN? 
>> SO THAT MOMENT WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT SAID WE WERE GOING 
FOR A SIGNING, AN UNSCHEDULED 
SIGNING THAT REPORTERS WERE NOT 
PREPARED FOR. 
AND JUST AFTER 1:30 LOCAL TIME 
WE LEARNED WHAT HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT. 
THE DOCUMENT MR. TRUMP AND KIM 
SIGNED LISTS FOUR PROVISIONS, 
INCLUDING REAFFIRMING NORTH 
KOREA'S, QUOTE, COMMITMENT TO 
WORKING TOWARD COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
HERE'S SOME OF WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID IN A NEWS 
CONFERENCE AFTER THE SUMMIT. 
 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
EVERYBODY. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
WE'RE GETTING READY TO GO BACK, 
HAD A TREMENDOUS 24 HOURS, 
WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS THREE 
MONTHS, ACTUALLY, BECAUSE THIS 
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR QUITE A 
WHILE. 
THAT WAS A TAPE THAT WE GAVE TO 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND HIS PEOPLE, 
HIS REPRESENTATIVES, AND IT 
CAPTURES A LOT, IT CAPTURES 
WHAT COULD BE DONE, AND THAT'S 
A GREAT PLACE, HAS A POTENTIAL 
TO BE AN INCREDIBLE PLACE, 
BETWEEN SOUTH KOREA, IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT IT, AND CHINA, IT'S 
GOT TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL, AND I 
THINK HE UNDERSTANDS THAT, AND 
HE WANTS TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT. 
IT'S MY HONOR TODAY TO ADDRESS 
THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD 
FOLLOWING THIS VERY HISTORIC 
SUMMIT WITH CHAIRMAN KIM. 
KIM KIM OF NORTH KOREA. 
SPENT -- WITH CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-
UN OF NORTH KOREA. 
WE SPENT VERY INTENSIVE HOURS 
TOGETHER, AND I THINK MOST OF 
YOU HAVE GOTTEN THE SIGNED 
DOCUMENT OR YOU WILL VERY 
SHORTLY. 
IT'S VERY COMPREHENSIVE, IT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN. 
I STAND BEFORE YOU AS AN 
EMISSARY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
TO DELIVER A MESSAGE OF HOPE 
AND VISION AND A MESSAGE OF 
PEACE. 
LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING OUR 
INCREDIBLE HOSTS IN SINGAPORE, 
ESPECIALLY PRIME MINISTER LE, A 
FRIEND OF MINE. 
THIS IS A COUNTRY OF PROFOUND 
GRACE AND BEAUTY, AND WE SEND 
OUR WARMEST WISHES TO EVERY 
CITIZEN OF SINGAPORE WHO REALLY 
MADE THIS VISIT SO IMPORTANT 
AND SO PLEASANT DESPITE ALL OF 
THE WORK AND ALL OF THE LONG 
HOURS. 
I ALSO WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT 
MOON OF SOUTH KOREA. 
HE'S WORKING HARD. 
IN FACT, I'LL BE SPEAKING TO 
HIM RIGHT AFTER WE'RE FINISHED. 
PRIME MINISTER ABE OF JAPAN, A 
FRIEND OF MINE, JUST LEFT OUR 
COUNTRY, AND HE WANTS WHAT'S 
RIGHT FOR JAPAN AND THE WORLD, 
A GOOD MAN. 
AND A VERY SPECIAL PERSON, 
PRESIDENT XI OF CHINA WHO HAS 
REALLY CLOSED UP THAT BORDER, 
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT LESS SO OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, BUT 
THAT'S OKAY. 
BUT HE REALLY HAS, AND HE'S A 
TERRIFIC PERSON AND A FRIEND OF 
MINE AND A REALLY A GREAT 
LEADER OF HIS PEOPLE. 
I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR 
EFFORTS TO HELP US GET TO THIS 
VERY HISTORIC DAY. 
MOST IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO 
THANK CHAIRMAN KIM FOR TAKING 
THE FIRST BOLD STEP TOWARDS A 
BRIGHT NEW FUTURE FOR HIS 
PEOPLE, OUR UNPRECEDENTED 
MEETING, THE FIRST BETWEEN AN 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND A LEADER 
OF NORTH KOREA PROVES THAT REAL 
CHANGE IS INDEED POSSIBLE. 
MY MEETING WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 
WAS HONEST, DIRECT AND 
PRODUCTIVE. 
WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 
IN A VERY CONFINED PERIOD OF 
TIME, UNDER VERY STRONG, STRONG 
CIRCUMSTANCE. 
WE'RE PREPARED TO START A NEW 
HISTORY, AND WE'RE READY TO 
WRITE A NEW CHAPTER BETWEEN OUR 
NATIONS. 
NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO, THINK OF 
THAT, NEARLY 70 YEARS AGO AN 
EXTREMELY BLOODY CONFLICT 
RAVAGED THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
COUNTLESS PEOPLE DIED IN THE 
CONFLICT, INCLUDING TENS OF 
THOUSANDS OF BRAVE AMERICANS, 
YET WHILE THE ARMISTICE WAS 
AGREED TO, THE WAR NEVER ENDED, 
TO THIS DAY NEVER ENDED, BUT 
NOW WE CAN ALL HAVE HOPE THAT 
IT WILL SOON END, AND IT WILL, 
IT WILL SOON END. 
THE PAST DOES NOT HAVE TO 
DEFINE THE FUTURE. 
YES, IT IS CONFLICT, IT DOES 
NOT HAVE TO BE TOMORROW'S WAR, 
AND AS HISTORY HAS PROVEN OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN, ADVERSARIES CAN 
INDEED BECOME FRIENDS. 
WE CAN HONOR THE 
THERE IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT NORTH 
KOREA CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IT GIVES 
UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND 
EMBRACES COMMERCE AND 
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE 
WORLD THAT REALLY WANTS TO 
ENGAGE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 
OPPORTUNITY LIKE NO OTHER AS 
THE LEADER TO USHERED IN A 
GLORIOUS NEW ERA OF SECURITY 
AND PROSPERITY FOR HIS PEOPLE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST SIGNED 
A JOINT STATEMENT IN WHICH HE 
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS 
NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE 
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT. 
THIS ISN'T THE PAST. 
THIS ISN'T ANOTHER 
ADMINISTRATION THAT NEVER GOT 
IT STARTED, AND THEREFORE NEVER 
GOT IT DONE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS TOLD ME THAT 
NORTH KOREA IS ALREADY 
DESTROYING A MAJOR MISSILE 
ENGINE TESTING SITE. 
THAT'S NOT IN YOUR SIGNED 
DOCUMENT. 
WE AGREED TO THAT AFTER THE 
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED. 
THAT'S A BIG THING FOR THE 
MISSILES THAT THEY WERE 
TESTING, THE SITE IS GOING TO 
BE DESTROYED VERY SOON. 
TODAY IS THE BEGINNING OF 
ANARDUOUS PROCESS. 
OUR EYES ARE WIDE OPEN, BUT 
PEACE IS ALWAYS WORTH THE 
EFFORT, ESPECIALLY IN THIS 
CASE. 
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE 
YEARS AGO. 
THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESOLVED 
A LONG TIME AGO. 
BUT WE ARE WE'RE RESOLVING IT 
NOW. 
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS THE CHANCE TO 
SEIZE AN INCREDIBLE FUTURE FOR 
HIS PEOPLE. 
ANYONE CAN MAKE WAR, BUT ONLY 
THE MOST COURAGEOUS CAN MAKE 
PEACE. 
THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS 
CANNOT ENDURE FOREVER, THE 
PEOPLE OF KOREA, NORTH AND 
SOUTH ARE PROFOUNDLY 
TALENTED, INDUSTRIOUS AND 
GIFTED. 
THESE ARE TRULY GIFTED PEOPLE. 
THEY SHARE THE SAME HERITAGE, 
LANGUAGE, CULTURE, 
CUSTOMS AND DESTINY. 
BUT TO REALIZE THEIR AMAZING 
DESTINY, TO REUNITE THEIR 
NATIONAL FAMILY, THE MENACE OF 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS WILL NOW BE 
REMOVED. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THE SANCTIONS 
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT. 
WE DREAM OF A FUTURE WHERE ALL 
KOREANS CAN LIVE TOGETHER IN 
HARMONEY, WHERE FAMILIES ARE 
REUNITED AND HOPES ARE REBORN, 
AND WHERE THE LIGHT OF PEACE 
CHASES AWAY THE DARKNESS OF 
WAR, THIS BRIGHT FUTURE IS 
WITHIN IT AND THIS IS WHAT'S 
HAPPENING. 
IT IS RIGHT THERE, IT'S WITHIN 
OUR REACH. 
IT'S GOING TO BE THERE. 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. 
PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS COULD NEVER 
TAKE PLACE. 
IT IS NOW TAKING PLACE. 
IT'S A VERY GREAT DAY, IT'S A 
VERY GREAT MOMENT IN THE 
HISTORY OF THE WORLD, AND 
CHAIRMAN KIM IS ON HIS WAY BACK 
TO NORTH KOREA, AND I KNOW FOR 
A FACT AS SOON AS HE ARRIVES 
HE'S GOING TO START A PROCESS 
THAT'S GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF 
PEOPLE VERY HAPPY AND VERY 
SAFE. 
SO IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH 
EVERYBODY TODAY, THE MEDIA. 
THIS IS A BIG GATHERING OF 
MEDIA, I WILL SAY. 
MAKES ME FEEL VERY 
UNCOMFORTABLE. 
BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS 
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO ALL 
OF US, INCLUDING YOURSELF AND 
YOUR FAMILIES. 
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
BEING HERE. 
WE'LL TAKE SOM QUESTIONS. 
WOW! 
THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 
GO AHEAD. 
SURE. 
GO AHEAD. 
NBC. 
>>REPORTER:  THANKS, MR.
PRESIDENT.
TWO QUESTIONS FOR YOU, IF YOU 
DON'T MIND. 
FIRST, THE MAN YOU MET TODAY, 
KIM JONG-UN, AS YOU KNOW HAS 
KILLED FAMILY MEMBERS, HAS 
STARVED HIS OWN PEOPLE, IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATH OF 
OTTO WARMBIER. 
WHY ARE YOU SO COMFORTABLE 
CALLING HIM VERY TALENTED? 
>> WELL, HE IS VERY TALENTED. 
ANYBODY THAT TAKES OVER A 
SITUATION LIKE HE DID AT 26 
YEARS OF AGE AND IS ABLE TO RUN 
IT AND RUN IT TOUGH, I DON'T 
SAY HE WAS NICE, OR I DON'T SAY 
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, BUT VERY FEW 
PEOPLE AT THAT AGE -- YOU COULD 
TAKE ONE OUT OF 10,000 PROBABLY 
COULDN'T DO IT. 
OTTO WARMBIER IS A VERY SPECIAL 
PERSON, AND HE WILL 
BE FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE. 
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 
MINE. 
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 
DAY. 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH 
KOREA. 
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 
VAIN. 
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS. 
A SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.HE HAD 
A LOT TO DO WITH US BEING HERE 
TODAY. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>>REPORTER:  MR. PRESIDENT, 
THAT SECOND QUESTION FOR YOU, 
SIR, IS ON THE SECURITY -- 
SECOND QUESTION IS ON THE 
SECURITY ASSURANCES YOU TALKED 
ABOUT IN YOUR STATEMENT. 
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 
ASSURANCES YOU ARE WILLING TO 
GIVE TO KIM JONG-UN? 
DOES THAT INCLUDE REDUCING 
MILITARY CAPABILITIES? 
AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON YOUR 
ANSWER -- 
>> NO, WE'RE NOT REDUCING 
ANYTHING. 
AT SOME POINT I HAVE TO BE 
HONEST, AND I USED TO SAY THIS 
DURING MY CAMPAIGN, AS YOU KNOW 
PROBABLY BETTER THAN MOST, I 
WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS OUT. 
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 
BACK HOME. 
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 
THEM BACK HOME. 
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY, 
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD, BUT WE'LL 
BE SAVING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 
OF MONEY, PLUS I THINK IT'S 
VERY PROVOCATIVE. 
YES, JOHN. 
YES, JOHN, GO AHEAD. 
OH. 
GO AHEAD. 
I'M SORRY. 
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOHN 
ROBERTS. 
I LOOKED AT YOU. 
YOU LOOK MUCH BETTER, RIGHT? 
>>REPORTER:  WE'RE FREQUENTLY
CONFUSED,
MR. PRESIDENT. 
MR. PRESIDENT, THIS JOINT 
STATEMENT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT 
VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
>> YEAH. 
>>REPORTER:  IS THAT A 
CONCESSION ON PART OF THE 
UNITED STATES? 
>> NO, NOT AT ALL. 
IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT SAID WE 
ARE GOING TO -- LET'S SEE HERE, 
IT WILL BE GONE -- I DON'T 
THINK YOU CAN BE ANY MORE PLAIN 
THAN WHAT WE'RE ASKING, ISSUES 
RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF 
THE NEW U.S. D.P.K.R. 
RELATIONS, THE BUILDING. 
WE TALK ABOUT THE GUARANTEES, 
AND WE TALK ABOUT UNWAVERING 
COMMITMENT TO THE COMPLETE THIS 
IS THE DOCUMENT THAT WE JUST 
SIGNED. 
>>REPORTER:  DID YOU DISCUSS 
WITH CHAIRMAN KIM METHODS TO 
VERIFY, EITHER WITH WITH THE 
UNITED 
STATES OR INTERNATIONAL 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT VERY 
PROCESS? 
>> YES, WE DID. 
IT WILL BE -- WE'LL BE 
VERIFYING. 
>>REPORTER:  HOW IS THAT GOING 
TO BE ACHIEVED, MR. PRESIDENT? 
>> WELL, IT'S GOING TO BE 
ACHIEVED BY HAVING A LOT 
OF PEOPLE THERE. 
AND AS WE DEVELOP -- BE 
ACHIEVED BY HAVING A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THERE. 
AND AS WE DEVELOP THAT TRUST, 
SECRETARY POMPEO HAS REALLY 
BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, HIS 
STAFF, EVERYBODY. 
AS WE DO THAT, WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE. 
WHILE WE'RE THERE, WE'RE GOING 
TO BE WORKING ON A LOT OF OTHER 
THINGS, BUT THIS IS COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH 
KOREA, AND IT WILL BE VERIFIED. 
>>REPORTER:  WILL THOSE PEOPLE 
BE AMERICANS OR INTERNATIONAL 
-- 
>> COMBINATIONS OF BOTH. 
AND WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
IT.RCHLTDZ WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 
A QUICK BREAK. 
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE COVERAGE 
OF THE HISTORIC SUMMIT IN 
SINGAPORE. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, CBS 
NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>>  LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO CBS 
NEWS POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ED 
O'KEEFE. 
HE'S JOINING ME IN WASHINGTON 
AND OF COURSE HERE ON SET ISAAC 
STONE FISH. 
FIRST, ED, TO YOU. 
THERE'S A LOT TO UNRAVEL HERE. 
AS WE SAID, THE PRESIDENT SPOKE 
AND TOOK QUESTIONS FROM 
REPORTERS FOR OVER AN HOUR. 
BUT HERE'S SORT OF I THINK THE 
HIGHLIGHTS THAT NEED TO BE SORT 
OF TALKED ABOUT. 
ONE, THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT 
HE ACTUALLY MADE NO 
CONCESSIONS, THAT HE WAS JUST 
MEETING WITH THE NORTH KOREAN 
DICTATOR, BUT THE REALITY IS 
HE'S SUGGESTED TO REPORTERS 
REPORTERS THERE THAT HE WILL 
STOP THOSE WAR GAMES THAT HAVE 
BEEN ONGOING FOR MANY, MANY 
YEARS ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT POSSIBLY 
REMOVING TROOPS FROM SOUTH 
KOREA. 
TWO HUGE CONCESSIONS ONE WOULD 
SAY, CERTAINLY CHINA AND THE 
NORTH KOREANS BENEFICIARIES IF 
THE PRESIDENT DECIDES TO FOLLOW 
THROUGH. 
THOSE ARE JUST TWO OF THE 
BIGGER HEADLINES THAT I COULD 
SORT OF COME UP WITH. 
BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE 
CAN UNRAVEL. 
BUT YOUR TAKE. 
>> YEAH. 
AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT THE 
IDEA THAT HE'S INVITED HIM TO 
THE WHITE HOUSE IS A SIGN OF 
LEGITIMACY AND RESPECT THAT HAS 
NOT BEEN AFFORDED TO OTHER 
WORLD LEADERS AND CERTAINLY 
WOULD BE A REAL FEATHER IN HIS 
CAP AS WELL. 
AS YOU SAID, LOTS TO UNPACK 
HERE. 
AMONG OTHER THINGS, LET'S SORT 
OF RUN THROUGH IT HERE, HE SAYS 
THAT U.S. SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN 
ON NORTH KOREA -- EXISTING U.S. 
SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN ON NORTH 
KOREA AS THESE TALKS CONTINUE, 
AND SUGGESTED THAT HE BATTED 
AWAY A HANDFUL OF MORE 
SANCTIONS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE 
DISRESPECTFUL, SAID THE U.S. 
WILL END THE WAR GAMES, SAID 
THAT NORTH KOREA WILL BEGIN 
DESTROYING ITS MISSILE TESTING 
SITES. 
HOW THAT WOULD BE VERIFIED, 
HOWEVER, HE WOULD NOT SAY OR 
WOULD NOT SHARE. 
THE IDEA THAT THOUSANDS OF 
MISSING PEOPLE FROM THE KOREAN 
CONFLICT WILL BE RETURNED, 
AGAIN, WHETHER OR NOT THEY KNOW 
THAT THOSE THOUSANDS ARE STILL 
WITHIN NORTH KOREA'S BORDERS, 
HOW THAT WOULD HAPPEN, WHEN 
THAT WOULD HAPPEN WAS UNCLEAR. 
DID SAY THAT TALKS BETWEEN THE 
TWO COUNTRIES WOULD CONTINUE 
NEXT WEEK. 
AND BY ROPING IN THE SOUTH 
KOREAN LEADER, THE CHINESE, THE 
JAPANESE UNDOUBTEDLY THEY'LL 
REMAIN ENGAGED IN ALL THIS AS 
WELL SUGGESTED HE WOULD VISIT 
PYONGYANG AT SOME POINT DOWN 
THE ROAD, AND DID EXTEND THAT 
INVITE TO 
CHAIRMAN KIM TO VISIT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
AND ADMITTED DENUCLEARIZATION 
WILL TAKE A LONG TIME, SAYING 
THAT SCIENTIFICALLY HE'S BEEN 
TOLD IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME, 
BUT LATER SUGGESTED IT COULD GO 
PRETTY FAST. 
SO TAKE IT EITHER WAY YOU'D 
LIKE. 
DID SUGGEST THINGS WITH THE G7 
NATIONS DIDN'T GO AS BAD AS YOU 
MIGHT THINK, THAT IN FACT THE 
CONVERSATIONS WERE CONSTRUCTIVE 
AND CORDIAL. 
AND IF YOU NEEDED ANY REMINDER 
THAT THIS IS A PRESIDENT THAT 
CLOSELY AND CAREFULLY CONSUMES 
THAT THAT IS SAID AND WRITTEN 
BY THE NEWS MEDIA, YOU GOT IT 
YET AGAIN TODAY AS HE RECALLED 
SPECIFIC STORIES THAT HAVE BEEN 
WRITTEN IN THE PAST BY VARIOUS 
REPORTERS THAT WERE THERE 
QUESTIONING HIM. 
VLAD, WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK THIS 
WITH OUR COLLEAGUE MARK WHO 
TRACKS THESE THINGS CLOSELY, I 
CANNOT 
RECALL SINCE HE BECAME 
PRESIDENT MR. TRUMP TAKING 
QUESTIONS FROM EVERY NEWS 
OUTLET THAT SITS IN THE FRONT 
ROW OF THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS 
BRIEFING ROOM, AMONG OTHERS. 
THIS IS A SIGN PERHAPS THAT 
HE'S GOING TO BE MORE 
WILLING TO DO THAT OR PERHAPS 
JUST A SIGN THAT ON TODAY, A 
HISTORIC DAY FOR HIM FOR HIS 
ADMINISTRATION, HE'S WILLING TO 
ENGAGE THE PRESS A LITTLE MORE 
THAN USUAL. 
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THE 
PRESIDENT FEELING MUCH MORE 
COMFORTABLE, FEELING THAT HE IS 
IN CONTROL OF THE WHITE HOUSE, 
OF HIS ADMINISTRATION, OF HIS 
DESTINY AND THAT PERHAPS HAS 
LED HIM TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE 
WITH SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE 
PRESS WHO IN THE PAST HE HAS 
NOT 
CHOSEN TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM. 
CBS POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 
REPORTER FOR THE AP WHO COVERS 
THE WHITE HOUSE ZEKE MILLER 
JOINS ME ON THE TELEPHONE. 
ZEKE, YOU WERE IN THAT ROOM 
WHILE THE PRESIDENT WAS TAKING 
QUESTIONS. 
I MEAN, AGAIN, THIS WAS A LONG 
PRESS CONFERENCE, AN HOUR AND 
FIVE MINUTES, YOUR TAKEAWAYS.
>> THIS, YOU KNOW, EPITOMIZED 
THE PRESIDENT. 
THE PRESIDENT SEEN ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE NOW FOR A 
YEAR AND A HALF, IN AMERICAN 
LIFE, FOR THREE YEARS, BEEN IN 
OUR LIVING ROOMS AND TVs FOR 
TWO DECADES. 
THIS IS THE DEAL MAKER THAT 
SAID HE ALONE COULD FIX IT, 
GETTING IN THE ROOM WITH KIM 
JONG-UN, THIS AUTOCRAT AND 
TRYING TO CUT THIS AGREEMENT TO 
BRING BACK THIS INDETRACTABLE 
GLOBAL ISSUE. 
THE QUESTION IS DID HE 
ACCOMPLISH THAT? 
THE DEVIL IS IN DETAILS THERE. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF INDICATIONS 
THAT IN FACT THAT'S WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO 
ACCOMPLISH, BUT CERTAINLY FROM 
HIS PUBLIC DEMEANOR HERE IN 
THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, THIS IS 
-- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMED THIS -- 
IT SEEMED TO BE ONE OF THE BEST 
DAYS IF NOT THE BEST DAY OF HIS 
PRESIDENCY, SORT OF FREE-FORM 
PRESS CONFERENCE, TAKING 
QUESTIONS LIKE HE HASN'T SINCE 
THE VERY EARLIEST DAYS OF THE 
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, MAYBE 
2015, IT FELT HE WAS LOOSE, HE 
WAS 
HAPPY, COMFORTABLE, FEELING 
LIKE HE WAS -- HE IS REALLY 
CONTROLLING HIS OWN DESTINY 
HERE. 
>> YOU KNOW, ZEKE, I MEAN, 
AGAIN, IF YOU JUST GO BACK, AND 
WE WILL OBVIOUSLY OVER THE 
COURSE OF THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
HOURS BE HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF 
THE STATEMENTS THE PRESIDENT 
MADE, SOME OF THE ANSWERS THAT 
HE GAVE TO REPORTERS THERE, 
BUT, AGAIN, THE IDEA THAT THE 
U.S. WILL STOP MILITARY 
EXERCISES ON THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA IN THE REGION, 
PLEDGES TO 
REMOVE TROOPS AT SOME POINT 
SAYING THEY COST BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS, THAT IT'S VERY 
EXPENSIVE, NO NEW SANCTIONS IN 
PLACE, AND ALL WE ARE GETTING 
APPEARS TO BE WHAT IS IN THIS 
DOCUMENT, THIS DOCUMENT WHICH 
IN EFFECT IS A VAGUE PROMISE TO 
DENUCLEARIZE AT SOME POINT. 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
YOU KNOW, IF THIS DOCUMENT WERE 
TO BE COMPLETELY AND FULLY 
EXECUTED TO ITS FULLEST 
CONCLUSION, THIS WOULD BE A 
MASSIVE SUCCESS BY THE 
PRESIDENT. 
IF NORTH KOREA WERE TO GIVE UP 
ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, HOWEVER 
LONG THAT PROCESS WOULD BE, 
MASSIVE FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESS 
FOR THIS PRESIDENT, NOBODY 
DISPUTES THAT. 
BUT SIGNING A DOCUMENT IS VERY 
DIFFERENT FROM ACTUALLY 
ACCOMPLISHING THAT GOAL, AND 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE IS 
ELEVATED KIM JONG-UN, ELEVATED 
NORTH KOREA ON THE 
INTERNATIONAL STAGE, ENDING 
GENERATIONS OF ISOLATION FOR 
THAT GOVERNMENT, AND MAKING 
SOME KEY SANCTIONS THAT ARE 
GOING TO RANKLE KEY U.S. ALLIES 
AND AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE 
THIS QUESTIONS THIS IS NOT JUST 
ABOUT SOUTH KOREA OBVIOUSLY [ 
INAUDIBLE  ] OTHER ALLIES AROUND
THE WORLD WHO WILL COME TO 
QUESTION WHETHER THEY ARE 
ASSURANCES BY THE UNITED STATES 
WILL LAST. 
SO FOR THE PRESIDENT -- YOU 
KNOW, IT'LL COME DOWN TO IS IT 
WORTH IT? 
WE HEARD HIM SAY ELEVATING KIM 
ON THE STAGE AND MAKING THOSE 
PROMISES, THOUGH COMMITMENTS 
ARE WORTH IT IF HE CAN ACTUALLY 
ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. 
IF NOT, IN SIX MONTHS, IN SIX 
YEARS, WE MAY BE HAVING A VERY 
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION LOOKING 
BACK AT THIS MOMENT VERY 
DIFFERENT AND THE PRESIDENT 
HINTED AT THAT SAYING HE WOULD 
PROBABLY TRY TO FIND AN EXCUSE, 
SOMEBODY ELSE TO BLAME IT ON, 
BUT THIS IS A MASSIVE RISK BY 
THIS PRESIDENT AND IT'LL TAKE 
SOME TIME TO SEE IF IT'LL PAY 
OFF OR NOT. 
>> ZEKE, ED, STAND BY, ISAAC, 
STAND BY. 
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 
THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT 
THIS VERY ISSUE. 
LET'S PLAY THAT. 
>> I WANT TO GET OUR SOLDIERS 
OUT. 
I WANT TO BRING OUR SOLDIERS 
BACK HOME. 
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 32,000 
SOLDIERS IN SOUTH KOREA, AND 
I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BRING 
THEM BACK HOME. 
BUT THAT'S NOT PART OF THE 
EQUATION RIGHT NOW. 
AT SOME POINT I HOPE IT WILL 
BE, BUT NOT RIGHT NOW. 
WE WILL BE STOPPING THE WAR 
GAMES WHICH WILL SAVE US A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY 
UNLESS AND UNTIL WE SEE THE 
FUTURE NEGOTIATION IS NOT GOING 
ALONG LIKE IT SHOULD. 
BUT WE'LL BE SAVING A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. 
PLUS I THINK IT'S VERY 
PROVOCATIVE. 
>> ISAAC, TO YOU NOW. 
WHEN YOU HEARD THAT, THAT I 
THINK -- WE BOTH LOOKED AT EACH 
OTHER AND SAID THAT WAS 
SOMETHING WE NEVER HEARD WAS 
EVEN ON THE TABLE, THE IDEA OF 
THE UNITED STATES STOPPING 
THESE WAR GAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN 
IN PLAY FOR MANY, MANY YEARS. 
WHAT DID YOU THINK WHEN YOU 
HEARD THAT? 
>> I THINK THROUGHOUT THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE, AND, 
ACTUALLY, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE 
NINE-HOUR PERIOD THAT WE'VE 
BEEN WATCHING THIS, I HAVE FELT 
JUST SO SHOCKED, AND THIS HAS 
BEEN SUCH A SURPRISING TURN OF 
EVENTS. 
AND I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND 
WHY TRUMP FELT THE NEED TO STOP 
THE WAR GAMES. 
THEY ARE SOMETHING THAT SHOWS 
U.S. RESOLVE IN THE REGION, NOT 
ONLY TO NORTH KOREA, BUT ALSO 
MORE IMPORTANTLY TO CHINA. 
AND IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S THIS 
WHOLE IDEA OF TRUMP AS THIS 
GREAT NEGOTIATOR AND YET HE 
GAVE UP ONE OF THE MOST 
IMPORTANT CARDS WE HAVE IN THE 
REGION SEEMINGLY FOR FREE. 
SO I THINK I AM BAFFLED BY THAT 
AND I'M BAFFLED BY A 
LOT OF THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF 
TRUMP'S MOUTH. 
>> WE'VE BEEN ON THE AIR FOR 
ABOUT NINE HOURS NOW, SO I 
DON'T RECALL WHO OF OUR GUESTS, 
MAYBE IT WAS YOU, THAT SAID 
THAT -- SOMEBODY MENTIONED 
THOSE WAR GAMES AND SAID IT 
ACTUALLY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
NORTH KOREA OR WITH CHINA, IT'S 
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND 
SOUTH KOREA, THAT'S THE 
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE WITH THE 
SOUTH KOREANS, AND IN SOME 
CASES THE JAPANESE TO CONDUCT 
THESE WAR GAMES, AND YET THE 
PRESIDENT -- IF KIM JONG-UN 
ASKED FOR THIS AND THE 
PRESIDENT GAVE THAT UP FOR SOME 
VAGUE PROMISES TO DENUCLEARIZE 
AT SOME POINT, THE PRESIDENT AT 
ONE POINT WAS ASKED HOW DO YOU 
ENSURE THAT, THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING, WELL, HOW CAN 
YOU ENSURE ANYTHING, IT SEEMED 
REMARKABLE. 
>> RIGHT. 
I THINK HE SAID THAT HOW CAN 
YOU ENSURE WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO 
SIT DOWN YOU ACTUALLY SIT DOWN. 
>> YEAH. 
>> AND, AGAIN, YOU KIND OF WANT 
TO THINK, OKAY, WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING THIS FOR SO LONG, WE 
MUST BE HEARING THINGS, BUT I 
THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE 
WAS SAYING AND THE POINT HE WAS 
EXACTLY MAKING ABOUT HOW YOU 
CAN'T ENSURE ANYTHING, AND SO 
THEREFORE 
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE UP THIS 
REALLY IMPORTANT DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONSHIP THAT WE HAVE AND 
THIS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH SOUTH KOREA 
SO THAT NORTH KOREA MAY 
EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT LATER 
IN THE FUTURE DO SOMETHING THAT 
THEY'VE ALREADY PROMISED  TO DO 
BUT HAVEN'T DONE. 
>> ED O'KEEFE, YOU'RE STILL 
WITH US. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW YOU THINK 
HAVING COVERED CONGRESS FOR 
MANY, MANY YEARS, HOW DO YOU 
THINK THIS IS GOING TO PLAY 
WITH SOME CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS 
OF CONGRESS, BOTH REPUBLICAN 
AND DEMOCRAT WHO ARE GOING TO 
LOOK AT SOME OF THE REMARKS 
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE IN THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE AND SAY, WOA, 
WHOA, WHOA, WE -- THE IDEA THAT 
WE WOULD STOP PROTECTING OUR 
ALLIES BY REMOVING TROOPS FROM 
THE PENINSULA OR STOPPING THESE 
WAR GAMES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 
WE THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 
BE SUGGESTING OR EVEN 
ADVOCATING FOR, ALL THAT LOOKS 
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD IS 
THAT WE'RE ABANDONING OUR 
ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA WHILE 
EMBOLDENING THE NORTH KOREANS? 
>> YEAH. 
WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE A FAIR BIT 
OF SKEPTICISM FROM MEMBERS OF 
BOTH PARTIES. 
BUT I THINK WE'LL SEE SOME AT 
LEAST MEASURED SUPPORT FROM 
CERTAIN REPUBLICANS. 
SOME OF HIS BIGGEST DEFENDERS 
ON CAPITOL HILL ARE ALSO SOME 
OF THIS REGIME'S BIGGEST 
CRITICS, THE NORTH KOREAN 
REGIME'S BIGGEST CRITICS. 
I'M THINKING OF ENJOYS LIKE TOM 
COTTON -- LIKE GUYS OF TOM 
COTTON OF ARKANSAS OR OTHER 
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE PRETTY 
OUTSPOKEN ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS. 
YOU DID HEAR THE PRESIDENT SAY 
HE'D LIKE TO ENGAGE CONGRESS ON 
THAT, WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK 
LIKE, WHEN AND HOW REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN. 
LET ME JUST READ TO YOU A BIT, 
VLAD, FROM A STATEMENT THAT WAS 
PUT OUT LAST NIGHT BY TOP HOUSE 
DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE ABOUT AS 
MUCH INFLUENCE OVER THIS AS YOU 
AND I DO, FRANKLY, IN THE WAY 
POLITICS WORK IN WASHINGTON 
RIGHT NOW, BUT I THINK IT 
SPEAKS BROADLY TO HOW DEMOCRATS 
ARE GOING TO FEEL ABOUT LL OF 
THIS, AND THEY SAY IN PART, 
SUPPORT FROM OUR PARTNERS AND 
AN INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS WILL 
BE ESSENTIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL 
OUTCOME TO HIGH-STAKES NUCLEAR 
DIPLOMACY WITH PYONGYANG, A 
DEAL THAT PRESERVES THE STATUS 
QUO IN TERMS OF NORTH KOREA'S 
NUCLEAR CAPABILITY WHILE 
TRADING AWAY OUR ABILITY TO 
COUNTER THEIR NUCLEAR 
AGGRESSION AND PRO 
TO 
ACHIEVE AN AGREEMENT THAT LEADS 
TO LASTING PEACE WILL REQUIRE 
THE SUPPORT OF OUR ALLIES. 
IN ESSENCE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING 
HERE IS WE'RE COOL WITH THIS IF 
THE REST OF THE WORLD IS COOL 
WITH THIS. 
AND IF THEY AREN'T, WE'RE GOING 
TO HAVE A LOT OF SKEPTICISM. 
I SUSPECT IN THE COMING DAYS 
THERE WILL BE SOME 
BRIEFINGS FOR AT LEAST SENIOR 
LAWMAKERS TO LEARN A LITTLE 
MORE ABOUT THE DETAILS OF THIS, 
ABOUT THE PATH FORWARD AND 
POTENTIALLY ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 
AND SECRETARY POMPEO'S DIRECT 
INTERACTIONS WITH CHAIRMAN KIM 
AND HIS CLOSE-KNIT CIRCLE, AND 
SO WE MAY START TO LEARN A 
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IT IN THE 
COMING DAYS. 
I WOULD ONLY ADD TO WHAT 
ISAAC'S CONCERN WAS THERE ABOUT 
THE WAR GAMES. 
YOU KNOW, I THINK AS MUCH AS WE 
ARE SKEPTICAL THAT 
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE GOING TO 
DO ANY OF THIS, WE PROBABLY 
SHOULD BE JUST AS SKEPTICAL 
THAT WE WOULD EVER REALLY 
CONSIDER DOING THOSE THINGS 
UNTIL WE SEE SOME VERIFIABLE 
ACTION BY THE NORTH KOREANS 
BECAUSE IF HE IS PICKING UP THE 
PHONE TO SPEAK NEXT WITH THE 
SOUTH KOREAN AND -- WITH THE 
SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, ONE OF THE 
FIRST THINGS YOU CAN BET THAT 
THAT PHONE CALL WILL INCLUDE IS 
A QUESTION ABOUT, WAIT, WE'RE 
ENDING THOSE WAR GAMES? 
THAT'S PART OF OUR DEAL, NOT 
PART OF YOUR DEAL WITH THEM. 
SO I GOTTA BELIEVE THAT THERE 
WILL BE -- THERE WOULD 
BE A WHILE AT LEAST UNTIL THAT 
IS COMPLETELY TAKEN OFF THE 
TABLE. 
AND AS I RECALL, ISAAC, THOSE 
ARE ANNUAL WAR GAMES, RIGHT? 
THEY'RE NOT ONGOING. 
>> THERE ARE ANNUAL ONES. 
I THINK THERE ARE OTHER 
EXERCISES THAT THE UNITED 
STATES AND SOUTH KOREA DOES. 
I THINK THE ONES -- THERE'S 
PARTICULAR EXERCISES THAT THE 
NORTH KOREANS HAVE THE LARGEST 
PROBLEM WITH. 
BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF THEM 
REALLY SHOULD OR NEED TO BE ON 
THE TABLE TO NEGOTIATE UNLESS, 
AS YOU WERE 
SAYING, WE ARE GETTING CONCRETE 
DELIVERABLES FROM THE NORTH 
KOREANS, AND I THINK THAT'S A 
GOOD POINT. 
I THINK THE SOUTH KOREAN 
PRESIDENT, I THINK ALSO 
SECRETARY MATTIS AND OTHER 
MEMBERS OF TRUMP'S CABINET ARE 
GOING TO TRY TO WALK HIM BACK 
FROM A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT 
HE SAID IN THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL HAVE 
THE LATEST ON THE HISTORIC 
SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN, CBS 
NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
JEFF GLOR WHO IS JOINING ME NOW 
FROM SINGAPORE WHERE HE HAS 
BEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS TRACKING 
THIS HISTORIC MEETING BETWEEN 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NORTH 
KOREAN DICTATOR KIM JONG-UN. 
JEFF, REMARKABLE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THERE BY THE 
PRESIDENT, OVER AN HOUR AND 
FIVE MINUTES TAKING QUESTIONS 
FROM REPORTERS. 
>>REPORTER: 
YES, AN EXHAUSTIVE PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST 
WATCHED, AND NOW THE PRESIDENT 
PREPARES TO DEPART ON AIR FORCE 
ONE. 
KIM JONG-UN HAS ALREADY 
DEPARTED HERE. 
THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A LOT OF 
INSTANT ANALYSIS HERE, A LOT OF 
HAND WRINGING. 
I THINK BOTTOM LINE AT THIS 
POINT RIGHT NOW THERE IS THIS 
FRAMEWORK WHICH HAS BEEN 
SIGNED, THESE FOUR MAIN POINTS, 
AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. 
THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT 
SOMETHING HAPPENING NOW NEXT 
WEEK. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
BEING ASKED ABOUT WHEN KIM JONG-
UN POTENTIALLY VISITS THE 
UNITED STATES, WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD POTENTIALLY 
VISIT PYONGYANG, BUT WE HAVE TO 
WAIT ON THOSE DETAILS, VLAD. 
>> JEFF, TALK ABOUT THE -- IF 
WE TAKE A STEP BACK FROM THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WE JUST 
WITNESSED WITH THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND MEMBERS 
OF THE PRESS, THIS HISTORIC 
MEETING THAT WE ALL SAW 
UNFOLDING BEFORE OUR EYES HERE, 
AND YOU SAW FROM THE GROUND 
THERE IN SINGAPORE, THE FIRST-
EVER MEETING BETWEEN A SITTING 
UNITED STATES PRESIDENT AND A 
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA AND 
ULTIMATELY COMING AWAY WITH A 
SIGNED JOINT AGREEMENT, JUST 
THE HISTORY IN THE MAKING THAT 
HAPPENED OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
LAST NINE HOURS OR SO. 
>> YEAH. 
I THINK THERE WERE A COUPLE 
THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO. 
AS FAR AS LAST NIGHT GOES, 
THERE WAS -- YES, THERE WAS THE 
THEATER OF WHAT HAPPENED, THERE 
WAS WHAT WE SAW FROM THESE TWO 
MEN, THE MULTIPLE HANDSHAKES, 
THAT RELATIONSHIP -- BECAUSE 
THE PRESIDENT HAS TALKED ABOUT 
IT SO MUCH, BECAUSE HE HAS SAID 
HE FEELS LIKE THAT IS SO 
IMPORTANT, THAT POTENTIAL 
CONNECTION AND HOW THAT 
HAPPENS, ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S 
THE MEETING LAST NIGHT. 
AND THEN MORE IMPORTANT IS THE 
LANGUAGE IN THE FRAMEWORK WE 
SEE HERE NOW. 
DOES IT SAY COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION? 
YES, IT DOES. 
IS THE WORD VERIFIABLE IN 
THERE? 
NO. 
AS FAR AS THE SEQUENCE OF THE 
POINTS GOES, SOME HAVE NOTED 
ALREADY THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD 
HAVE PREFERRED AND GOT THAT. 
WE TALK ABOUT THESE FIRST TWO 
POINTS, FIRST TALKING ABOUT A 
STABLE FUTURE, PEACE, A PEACE 
REGIME ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, 
THOSE ARE THE FIRST COUPLE 
POINTS IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND 
THEN IT MOVES DOWN TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND THEN 
THERE'S THE FOURTH POINT WHICH 
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SO MANY IN 
THE U.S. AND THAT IS THE RETURN 
OF THESE POW/MIA REMAINS. 
THE PRESIDENT INDICATED AT THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS A 
LAST MINUTE ADDITION, BUT ITS 
ERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN 
TALKED ABOUT BETWEEN THESE TWO 
SIDES FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. 
>> "CBS EVENING NEWS" ANCHOR 
JEFF GLOR REPORTING TO US FROM 
SINGAPORE. 
JEFF, WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 
REPORTING ON "CBS THIS MORNING" 
AND LATER TONIGHT ON "THE CBS 
EVENING NEWS." 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> THANKS, VLAD. 
>> LET'S BRING BACK ZEKE 
MILLER, A WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE A.P. 
HE'S JOINING ME ON THE PHONE 
FROM SINGAPORE. 
SO, ZEKE, THE PRESIDENT ON HIS 
WAY BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, 
WE KNOW THAT CHAIRMAN KIM HAS 
ALREADY DEPARTED SINGAPORE, 
THERE WILL BE QUESTIONS, THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING HE'S GOING TO 
TAKE A LITTLE BREAK, HES BEEN 
UP FOR 25 HOURS, HE DESERVES A 
BREAK AFTER THIS HISTORIC 
MEETING, BUT THERE WILL BE 
QUESTIONS AND THERE WILL BE 
FOLLOWUPS, ESPECIALLY TO THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO 
AT THE END OF HIS REMARKS HERE 
THE PRESIDENT POINTING TO HIS 
SECRETARY OF STATE SAYING, 
LOOK, YOU GOTTA GET THAT BALL 
OVER 
THE FINISH LINE. 
>> YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
AND THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION 
WE'VE TALKING FOR THE LAST 
SEVERAL HOURS NOW SINCE THIS 
DOCUMENT WAS SIGNED AND WE 
STARTED LEARNING WHAT WAS IN 
IT. 
REALLY, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALL 
THESE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS AGREED 
TO, WHAT WILL HE ACTUALLY 
IMPLEMENTED, YOU KNOW, THIS 
VERY LIMITED BROAD AGREEMENT, 
AND THAT WILL BE UP TO, AS THE 
PRESIDENT SAID, MIKE POMPEO AND 
OTHER 
NEGOTIATORS WILL BEGIN MEETING 
NEXT WEEK, WHAT WILL THAT 
PROCESS LOOK LIKE. 
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
HINTED THAT HE WAS LOOKING TO 
SEE CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA JOIN 
THESE TALKS IN SOME FORM OR 
FASHION. 
WILL OTHERS BE BROUGHT IN? 
WHAT WILL THE NATURE -- HOW 
OFTEN WILL THEY MEET? 
WILL THERE BE CERTAIN 
TIMETABLES FOR THESE 
DELIVERABLES TO BE MET? 
WE REALLY DON'T KNOW ANY OF 
THAT RIGHT NOW.ACTUALLY, IF 
ANYTHING, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE 
LOOKING TO HEAR OUT OF THE 
SUMMIT, IT WAS A TIMETABLE 
STRUCTURE FOR SOME OF THOSE 
TALKS AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE 
OF THOSE THINGS WE HAVEN'T 
QUITE LEARNED YET. 
MAYBE WE WILL LEARN THAT WHILE 
THE PRESIDENT IS FLYING BACK TO 
THE UNITED STATES. 
AND THEN ALSO WILL THERE BE 
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME OF THESE 
-- WE TALK ABOUT THE PRESIDENT 
CALLING THE QUESTION, THE 
NATURE OF THESE ALLIANCES WHEN 
IT COMES TO THE WAR GAMES, HIS 
CONVERSATION COMING UP WITH 
PRESIDENT MOON JUST A BIT. 
WILL THERE BE ALLIANCE FROM THE 
REGION AND AROUND THE WORLD IN 
THE WAY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
CONDUCTED THESE NEGOTIATIONS, 
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL BE 
WATCHING OBVIOUSLY VERY CLOSELY 
AT OVER THE HOURS AND WEEKS. 
>> ZEKE, I HOPE YOU CAN STAND 
BY. 
ED IS STILL WITH US AS WELL 
FROM OUR WASHINGTON 
BUREAU AND ISAAC IS HERE ON THE 
SET WITH ME. 
ED, TO YOU FIRST, AND, ISAAC, 
I'LL ASK YOU THE SAME THING. 
THERE WAS ONE MOMENT WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES 
WAS ASKED BY I THINK A MEMBER 
OF THE FOREIGN PRESS, I DON'T 
THINK IT WAS AN AMERICAN 
REPORTER WHO VERY POINTEDLY 
ASKED PRESIDENT TRUMP THE 
QUESTION THAT HAD BEEN ASKED BY 
ANALYSTS AND PUNDITS LEADING UP 
TO THIS HISTORIC MEETING WHICH 
IS BY MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN 
ARE YOU PROVIDING 
LEGITIMACY TO HIS REGIME? 
AND THE PRESIDENT SORT OF 
REFUSING TO ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION, MAYBE BECAUSE HE FELT 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO BECAUSE IT 
WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE U.S. 
PRESS, BUT THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSED 
IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD AS 
WE LOOK AT THE AGREEMENT THAT 
WAS SIGNED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND CHAIRMAN KIM. 
THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT, 
FOR EXAMPLE, AT ONE POINT 
SAYING TO A QUESTION FROM 
ANOTHER REPORTER 
SAYING THAT ONE OF THE GREAT 
WINNERS FROM THIS MEETING ARE 
THE GROUP OF NORTH KOREANS WHO 
ARE FORCED TO LABOR IN GULAGS, 
THE PRESIDENT SAYING THEY ARE 
ONE OF THE GREAT WINNERS AS A 
GROUP. 
I THINK THERE ARE GOING TO BE 
-- I KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL JUST 
A COUPLE OF MINUTES OUT OF THIS 
PRESS CONFERENCE, BUT THERE'S 
GOING TO BE A PARSING OF HIS 
WORDS, AND WORDS DO MATTER 
BECAUSE HE IS THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. 
>> YEAH. 
AND I THINK PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATIONS MIGHT HAVE PUT 
MORE EMPHASIS ON THAT QUESTION 
AND VERIFYING THAT THINGS ARE 
IMPROVING WHEN IT COMES TO 
HUMAN RIGHTS ALONGSIDE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
YOU KNOW, HE ALSO SUGGESTED AT 
ONE POINT THAT HUMAN RIGHTS DID 
COME UP. 
REMEMBER GOING INTO THIS 
MEETING WE WERE TOLD BY I 
BELIEVE SECRETARY POMPEO AND 
OTHER SENIOR ADMINISTRATION 
OFFICIALS THAT HUMAN RIGHTS 
WOULD NOT BE ON THE AGENDA. 
THEY MAY HAVE JUST SAID THAT 
PUBLICLY SO AS TO KEEP THE 
NORTH KOREANS FROM BACKING OUT 
AT THE LAST MINUTE AND MAYBE IT 
CAME UP IN THE MEETING, MAYBE 
IT DIDN'T COME UP IN THE 
MEETING. 
AND UNTIL WE GET SOME KIND OF 
VERIFICATION OF THAT, I THINK 
IT'S PROPER TO PERHAPS BE A BIT 
SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S 
STATEMENT THERE THAT IT DID 
INDEED GET DISCUSSED. 
BHU, YES, IT WILL DEFINITELY -- 
BUT, YES, IT WILL DEFINITELY BE 
A MAIN TOPIC OF CONCERN AMONG 
THE PRESIDENT'S TOP CRITICS, 
NOT ONLY IN SORT OF FOREIGN 
POLICY OF THE WORLD, BUT I 
WOULD THINK ON CAPITOL HILL 
LATER TODAY THERE WILL START TO 
BE SOME CONCERN THAT, HEY, 
MAYBE WE'RE GOING DOWN THE PATH 
TOO QUICKLY WITH THEM ON THIS 
AND NOT ALSO DISCUSSING THE 
FACT THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF NORTH KOREANS ARE IN FORCED 
LABOR CAMPS, THAT OTHERS 
HAVE BEEN KILLED WITH NO 
APPARENT REASON AND QUITE 
GRUESOMELY, AND THAT, YOU KNOW, 
THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 
CLEARLY HAS A TOTAL GRIP ON HIS 
COUNTRY AND NO SENSE OF 
DEMOCRACY. 
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS ALSO 
ASKED AT ONE POINT DO YOU HAVE 
A MODEL FOR WHAT A FUTURE NORTH 
KOREA MIGHT LOOK LIKE, AND HE 
SAID, WELL, THAT'LL BE UP TO 
THE 
NORTH KOREANS TO DECIDE WHICH 
IS A DEFT DIPLOMATIC STATEMENT 
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE 
DICTATING WHAT ANOTHER COUNTRY 
DOES NECESSARILY. 
BUT, AGAIN, I THINK SOME OF HIS 
PREDECESSORS MIGHT HAVE SAID 
SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, 
BUT WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY'LL 
ADOPT SOME SENSE OR SOME 
DEMOCRATIC NORMS AND BECOME A 
FREER SOCIETY. 
SO PERHAPS AN OPPORTUNITY 
MISSED THERE. 
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS 
BEEN PRETTY LASER FOCUSED ON 
THE IDEA OF DENUCLEARIZATION 
FIRST AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
LATER. 
>> ED, STAND BY. 
I WANT TO BRING INDUYNG KIM, 
SHE'S AT THE PENINSULA
-- I WANT TO BRING IN DEYEON 
KIM, SHE'S A SENIOR FELLOW AT 
THE PENINSULA OF FUTURE FORUM, 
SHE IS IN SINGAPORE. 
YOU WATCHED THESE EVENTS UNFOLD 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS 
CULMINATING IN THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES. 
I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE 
HISTORIC MEETING AND THEN SOME 
OF THE QUESTIONS THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ANSWERED, WHAT YOU 
THOUGHT OF HIS RESPONSES TO 
REPORTERS' QUESTIONS.GLP 
THANKS, VLAD. 
WELL, ON THE SUMMIT ITSELF, THE 
MEETING ITSELF, THE THEATRICS 
WERE THERE, THE ATMOSPHERE WAS 
THERE, AT LEAST THE PUBLIC 
VIDEO CLIPS THAT WE'VE SEEN OF 
THEM, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
DISCUSSION WAS LIKE IN PRVATE, 
BUT ON THE SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL, 
THE JOINT STATEMENT AND THE 
ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS DURING 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THEY 
LEAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS THAN 
ANSWERS. 
DID THEY AGREE ON WHAT 
DENUCLEARIZATION MEANS? 
DID THEY AGREE ON A TIMETABLE? 
IT SOUNDS LIKE BASED ON THE 
JOINT STATEMENT THEY DID NOT, 
AND PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT 
SECRETARY POMPEO IS GOING TO 
HAVE TO NEGOTIATE GOING 
FORWARD. 
ONE KEY ISSUE THAT STOOD OUT 
FOR ME DURING THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE WAS THE MENTIONING 
OF U.S. TROOPS ON THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA AND THE JOINT 
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH 
AMERICAN ALLIES, SOUTH KOREA. 
NOW, HE FIRST ANSWERED THE 
QUESTION AS SAYING, NO, WE'RE 
NOT REDUCING TROOPS ON THE 
KOREAN PENINSULA WHICH IS 
REASSURING TO BOTH SOUTH KOREA 
AND JAPANESE ALLIES, BUT THEN 
HE SAID HE WANTS TO WITHDRAW 
ALL HIS TROOPS AT SOME POINT, 
AND THAT IS A BIG MISTAKE. 
THE TROOPS ARE THERE TO 
MAINTAIN STABILITY AND SECURITY 
IN THE REGION. 
IT'S NOT JUST IN SOUTH KOREA, 
IT'S THE REGION AS A WHOLE. 
HE IS WRONG WHEN HE SAYS THAT 
IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO 
KEEP TROOPS THERE. 
IT'S MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE TO 
BRING THEM HOME. 
THE OTHER ISSUE I HAD WAS HE 
ANSWERED A QUESTION 
SAYING THAT THE WAR GAMES -- HE 
CALLS THEM WAR GAMES WILL BE 
DISCONTINUED, WILL BE CANCELED, 
AND THAT CONCERNS ME. 
DID HE MEAN THE JOINT MILITARY 
EXERCISES, THE DEFENSIVE 
DRILLS, OR DID HE MEAN THE 
BOMBERS AND THE STRATEGIC 
ASSETS THAT ARE MORE 
PROVOCATIVE IN THE DRILLS? 
IF IT'S THE FORMER, IF IT'S THE 
ENTIRE EXERCISES, THIS IS ALSO 
A BIG MISTAKE. 
THESE ARE DEFENSIVE IN NATURE, 
THE NORTH KOREANS KNOW THEY 
ARE, THEY KNOW WHEN THEY 
HAPPEN, AND IT 
REALLY IS -- IT'S JUST LIKE 
DROPPING YOUR SHIELD, YOUR 
DEFENSIVE SHIELD IN FRONT OF A 
DRAWN SWORD AND THAT DRAWN 
SWORD IS NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS. 
UNTIL NORTH KOREA GETS RID OF 
THE NUKE WEAPONS, THESE 
MILITARY EXERCISES SHOULD NOT 
BE STOPPED. 
>> DUYEON KIM JOINING US FROM 
SINGAPORE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
ANALYSIS. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
>>REPORTER:  THANK YOU. 
>>>  "FACE THE NATION" 
MODERATOR AND SENIOR FOREIGN 
AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT MARGARET 
BRENNAN IS JOINING ME NOW HERE 
AT THE TABLE. 
MARGARET, A REMARKABLE SERIES 
OF EVENTS UNFOLDING 
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS 
CULMINATING IN THAT PRESS 
CONFERENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND WHAT 
MANY PEOPLE ARE CALLING 
CONCESSIONS. 
LET'S FACE IT, WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID, WHAT DUYEON KIM 
JUST SAID, REMOVING TROOPS AT 
SOME POINT FROM THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA, STOPPING THE WAR 
GAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN DEFENSIVE 
IN NATURE, THEREFORE TO THE 
BENEFIT OF SOUTH KOREA, WHAT 
DID YOU MAKE OF THOSE RESPONSE? 
>> WELL, IT WILL BE INTERESTING 
TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY 
SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN THE 
AGREEMENT THAT WAS SIGNED THAT 
IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STATEMENT 
THAT WAS RELEASED BECAUSE THE 
STATEMENT THAT WE'VE GOTTEN 
THAT THE PRESS SECRETARY HANDED 
TO US WAS ALL VERY GENERAL. 
IT WAS A PLEDGE OF FUTURE 
ACTION, IT WAS A DESCRIPTION OF 
WHERE THEY WANT TO GO, A ROAD 
MAP, A FRAMEWORK, ALL OF THAT 
CAN BE PULLED BACK VERY 
QUICKLY. 
BUT WHAT I WILL SAY IS, LOOK, 
THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMUNITY 
BELIEVES REGARDLESS OF POLITICS 
THIS IS THE MOST PRESSING ISSUE 
IN TERMS OF THE THREAT TO U.S. 
TERRITORY. 
PRESIDENT OBAMA BEFORE THE 
PRESIDENT WAS INAUGURATED SAID 
THIS WILL BE YOUR NUMBER ONE 
CHALLENGE. 
SO GIVING THE PRESIDENT HIS DUE 
THAT HE GOT TO THIS POINT TO 
EVEN BEGIN TO ENGAGE 
DIPLOMATICALLY WHEN HIS 
PREFERRED OPTION AT FIRST 
GLANCE HAD BEEN MILITARILY IS 
SOMETHING, BUT IT IS REALLY 
GOING TO BE IN THE DETAILS IN 
TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY 
NEGOTIATE AT THAT MEETING NEXT 
WEEK, THAT JOHN 
BOLTON, THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
ADVISER, THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
WILL HAVE WITH THE NORTH 
KOREANS AND IN THE FUTURE. 
I MEAN, THIS IS THE BEGINNING 
OF A PROCESS. 
IT TOOK ABOUT TWO YEARS OF 
NEGOTIATING WITH IRAN TO GET 
THE AGREEMENT THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS DESCRIBED AS 
IMPERFECT AND TORE UP. 
THAT WAS TWO YEARS WITH A 
COUNTRY THAT DID NOT HAVE THE 
TYPE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM 
THAT NORTH KOREA HAS. 
SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
SOMETHING THAT POTENTIALLY 
GOES BEYOND THE, YOU KNOW, 
FIRST TERM OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
IF IT WORKS MAY NOT SEE FULL 
DISMANTLEMENT INTO THE SECOND 
TERM, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT 
BEHIND THE SCENES THEY'VE BEEN 
WORKING VERY QUICKLY TO TRY TO 
GET OUR PARTNERS, OTHER NUCLEAR 
POWERS TO CHIP IN, TO FIGURE 
OUT HOW THEY CAN POOL RESOURCES 
TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN MORE 
QUICKLY THAN ESTIMATES. 
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY IT 
WON'T TAKE 15 YEARS. 
THEY WANT IT TO HAPPEN IN A 
SHORTER DURATION OF TIME, BUT 
TO ACTUALLY DISMANTLE NUKES, 
NONE OF THAT WAS PROMISED 
TODAY. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
CRITICAL, AS YOU KNOW, OF THE 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND THERE WAS 
A QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF 
THE PRESIDENT, LOOK, IF YOU 
DON'T GET AT LEAST WHAT 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS ABLE TO GET 
WITH IRAN, THAT WAS DAVIDS 
SANGER, I BELIEVE, OF THE "NEW 
YORK TIMES," THAT'S A FAILURE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> DO YOU AGREE? 
>> WELL, DAVID AND I SPENT A 
LOT OF TIME IN VIENNA COVERING 
THESE NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN, 
YES, THAT THE BENCHMARK THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SET FOR HIMSELF 
AND HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. 
REMEMBER, MIKE POMPEO BEFORE HE 
WAS SECRETARY OF STATE WAS A 
CONGRESSMAN FROM KANSAS WHO 
RAISED HOLY HELL ABOUT THE IRAN 
NUCLEAR DEAL. 
HE TRIED TO STOP IT. 
AND SO HE'S GOT -- HE'S SET FOR 
HIMSELF A CHALLENGING SET OF 
CIRCUMSTANCES HERE. 
LOOK, THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, 
WHAT DID THEY GET? 
THEY GOT IRAN TO SHIP OUT 97% 
OF THEIR ENRICHED URANIUM. 
THEY GOT THEM TO DESTROY 
THOUSANDS OF CENTRIFUGES. 
THEY GOT THEM TO FREEZE A 
PROGRAM NO WHERE NEAR NORTH 
KOREA'S IS. 
WHAT THEY DIDN'T GET, THEY 
DIDN'T GET A HALT TO 
BALLISTIC MISSILE TESTING. 
REMEMBER ONE OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S COMPLAINTS  ABOUT THIS
DEAL THAT THEY COULD STILL FIRE 
OFF MISSILES. 
THEY DIDN'T GET THAT. 
NOW THE PRESIDENT HAS SET 
MISSILES ON HIS AGENDA FOR 
NORTH KOREA. 
THEY DIDN'T GET ACCESS TO ALL 
MILITARY BASES. 
THEY DID GET SNAP INSPECTIONS 
IN IRAN. 
THAT WAS ANOTHER COMPLAINT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SENT. 
THAT MEANS IN NORTH KOREA HE'S 
GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET KIM JONG-
UN TO SAY HAVE AT IT, LET YOUR 
INSPECTORS WANDER AROUND MY 
COUNTRY, INCLUDING INTO SOME OF 
THE MOST SECRET MILITARY BASES 
TO SEE IF I HAVE A NUCLEAR 
PROGRAM. 
THAT WASN'T AGREED TO TODAY. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAY HAVE 
TO COME IN THE FUTURE. 
THAT TAKES TIME. 
THAT TAKES TRUST TO BE ABLE TO 
GET. 
AND IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME TO 
GET THERE WITH IRAN. 
WE WILL SEE WHERE THEY GO WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
BUT THIS IS A STARTING POINT, 
AND, YOU KNOW, FOR SOMETHING 
THAT -- EVERYTHING IS 
POLITICIZED THESE DAYS, IF THEY 
CAN MAKE THIS WORK, IT WILL BE 
A WIN FOR THE WORLD, AT THE 
PRESIDENT SAID. 
IT'S A WORLD PROBLEM, HE'S NOT 
WRONG ON THAT. 
>> FOR SURE. 
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 
WONDERED HOW WE GOT TO THIS 
POINT, HOW WE GOT TO THE POINT 
WHERE A SITTING U.S. 
PRESIDENT WOULD MEET WITH A 
NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR. 
I WANT TO PLAY A LITTLE BIT OF 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT 
WHY HE CHOSE TO MAKE THIS AN 
IMPERATIVE LET'S PLAY THAT. 
>> FOR A LONG TIME IN MY LIFE, 
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD 
FRIENDS OF MINE. 
I THINK WITHOUT OTTO THIS WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 
DAY. 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING, IT WAS 
BRUTAL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE 
STARTED TO FOCUS ON WHAT WAS 
GOING ON, INCLUDING NORTH KOREA.
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 
VAIN. 
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS, 
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN. 
AND I HAVE TO SAY SPECIAL 
PARENTS, SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 
>> AND THE PRESIDENT THERE, 
MARGARET, SAYING THAT THIS ALL 
SORT OF BEGAN WITH OTTO, AT 
LEAST AS FAR AS WHERE WE ARE 
TODAY. 
AND WE TALKED ABOUT ALL 
THROUGHOUT THIS COVERAGE THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A CHANGE 
AGENT, HE'S A DISRUPTER, THAT'S 
WHAT HIS SUPPORTERS WANT FROM 
HIM, THAT'S WHAT HE'S 
DELIVERING. 
AND YET THERE ARE SEEMINGLY 
MOMENTS DURING THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE SPECIFICALLY WHERE 
HE SEEMED TO INDICATE, FOR 
EXAMPLE, WHEN THEY SAID, WELL, 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO 
VERIFY THIS? 
AND IT'S BECAUSE I TRUST 
CHAIRMAN KIM. 
AND AT ONE POINT SAYING HOW CAN 
YOU ENSURE ANYTHING? 
I THINK AS WE GO BACK AND WE 
LOOK AT THIS PRESS CONFERENCE, 
THERE IS CERTAINLY GOING TO BE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS 
NEGOTIATION TAKES PLACE, 
BECAUSE GIVEN THE PRESIDENT IS 
A CHANGE AGENT, THIS USUALLY 
HAPPENS AT THE END. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> IN OTHER WORDS, SECRETARY 
POMPEO AND OTHER DIPLOMATS, 
BOLTON AND THE OTHERS, THEY 
HAMMER OUT ALL THESE 
AGREEMENTS, THEN THE PRESIDENT 
MEETS WITH THE LEADER OF NORTH 
KOREA AND WE COME AWAY WITH AN 
AGREEMENT AND A FRAMEWORK IN 
PLACE. 
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE OF THAT. 
>> RIGHT. 
AND TO BE FAIR, EVEN THOSE WHO 
WERE IN HIGH NATIONAL 
SECURITY POSITIONS IN THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING THE 
FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL 
INTELLIGENCE JIM CLAPPER WHO IS 
NO FAN OF THIS PRESIDENT HAS 
SAID I GIVE HIM CREDIT ON THIS 
BECAUSE HE ADVOCATED, LOOK, 
YOU'VE GOTTA ENGAGE. 
AND IN A COUNTRY LIKE NORTH 
KOREA YOU DON'T HAVE 
BUREAUCRACIES AND PROFESSIONAL 
DIPLOMATS EMPOWERED 
IN THE WAY YOU MIGHT HAVE IN 
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT REALLY IN 
SOME WAYS THE ONLY PERSON WHO 
MATTERS IN TERMS OF DECISION 
MAKING IS THE GUY AT THE TOP, 
KIM JONG-UN. 
REMEMBER, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, 
YES, IS SITTING ACROSS FROM THE 
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD, 
THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT, HE'S 
SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO MURDERED HIS 
FAMILY MEMBERS. 
HE IS SOMEONE WHO'S CARRIED OUT 
MASS SOME WOULD SAY GENOCIDE, 
CERTAINLY MASS KILLING OF HIS 
OWN PEOPLE, 
STARVATION, LABOR CAMPS, 
GULAGS. 
SO THIS IS SOMEONE WHO IS 
TOTALITARIAN IN POWER. 
HE'S THE PERSON YOU'LL HAVE TO 
SIT AWAY FROM.THE UNITED STATES 
HAS BROKERED DEALS WITH BRUTAL 
MURDERERS IN THE PAST WHEN IT 
HAS SERVED THE NATIONAL 
SECURITY INTERESTS, AND THAT IS 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO 
DO TODAY. 
IT IS A HUGE DIPLOMATIC GAMBLE, 
AND IT IS INTERESTING THAT HE'S 
WILLING TO TAKE THAT RISK. 
AS YOU SAY, THE PEOPLE WEREN'T 
WILLING TO IN THE PAST. 
IT'S NOW GOING TO BE ALL IN THE 
DETAILS. 
THAT'S WHY JOURNALISTS WILL 
CONTINUE TO SCUTINIZE, 
ANALYSTS WILL CONTINUE TO PICK 
APART THESE DETAILS, NOT 
NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF ANY KIND 
OF POLITICS, BUT 
BECAUSE THIS HAS TO BE FLAWLESS 
IN EXECUTION FOR THIS GAMBLE TO 
PAY OFF. 
AND WHAT WE HAVE HEARD BEHIND 
THE SCENES IS THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND OTHERS HAVE SAID, 
LOOK, IF WE CAN JUST GET 
INSPECTORS ON THE GROUND, IF WE 
CAN JUST GET THEM TO OPEN UP 
THE DOORS, LET OUR PEOPLE IN 
THERE, HAVE EYES ON, EARS ON, 
WALK AROUND SOME OF 
THESE SITES AND GET A GOOD 
SENSE OF THINGS BECAUSE IT'S 
SUCH A BLACK BOX. 
WE KNEW FAR MORE ABOUT IRAN AND 
THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM THAN WE 
KNOW ABOUT NORTH KOREA BECAUSE 
OF OUR ALLIES IN THE REGION, 
BECAUSE OF SO MUCH OVER TIME. 
NORTH KOREA WE KNOW FAR LESS, 
AND WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM 
NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS 
FROM THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION, FROM THE 
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SAY, 
LOOK, IN THE PAST WHEN WE HAVE 
GOTTEN INSPECTORS IN THERE -- 
REMEMBER, THEY DID COME IN 
UNDER THAT 1994 AGREEMENT? 
>> I REMEMBER. 
>> AND THEY WERE THROWN OUT IN 
THE BUSH ERA WHEN THEY POINTED 
OUT THEY WERE CHEATING, THEY 
GOT ON THE GROUND AND SAID WE 
FOUND FAR MORE THAN WE EVER 
THOUGHT, AND THEY WERE 
ENRICHING AND DOING THINGS MORE 
AND BEYOND WHAT TH U.S. HAD 
THOUGHT POSSIBLE. 
SO IF THEY CAN AT LEAST GET IN 
THERE AND VERIFY, AND IT WAS 
OUR MAJOR GARRETT WHO ASKED 
ABOUT THAT, THE PRESIDENT WAS 
VAGUE, AS YOU SAY, BUT THAT'S 
WHEN IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO 
POMPEO AND BOLTON WORKING OUT 
HOW THIS WORKS AND BOLTON, SAY 
WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT HIS PAST 
COMMENTS IN POLITICS, HE IS 
SOMEONE WHO HAS A LOT OF 
EXPERIENCE IN ARMS CONTROL. 
>> WE'VE GOT JUST ABOUT TWO 
MINUTES LEFT, MARGARET, TO TALK 
ABOUT THIS. 
YOU POINT OUT THAT MAJOR DID 
ASK ABOUT THE VERIFYING OF -- 
AND HAVING INSPECTORS AND THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING, YEAH, YEAH, 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE, WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE A COMBINATION OF 
AMERICANS AND PERHAPS OTHERS, 
WHY NOT PUT THAT IN THE 
AGREEMENT THAT WE HAVE TODAY? 
AT LEAST SOMETHING CONCRETE? 
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING 
RIGHT NOW IS A LOT OF 
PEOPLE SAYING THIS THING IS 
VAGUE AND THE NORTH KOREANS, 
EVERY FOUR OF THOSE BULLET 
POINTS HAVE BEEN PROMISED IN 
1994 AND AGAIN IN 2000. 
>> THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING 
THEY HAVEN'T IRONED OUT. 
WE KNOW THE U.S. HAS PUT 
TOGETHER THEIR SORT OF DREAM 
TEAM THAT THEY WANT TO SEE WITH 
INSPECTORS AND PEOPLE WITH 
EXPERIENCE IN NUCLEAR POWER. 
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING JUST 
ANYONE CAN DO, RIGHT? 
YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BUILD A 
NUCLEAR WEAPON, TO KNOW HOW TO 
TAKE IT APART. 
AND THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBER OF 
SCIENTISTS WHO CAN DO THAT. 
SO THE U.S. HAS BEEN PUTTING 
TOGETHER ALLIES, THE U.K., 
OTHERS HAVE OFFERED RESOURCES. 
SOME OF OUR ADVERSARIES, 
RUSSIA, CHINA, THEY'VE GOT 
EXPERIENCE WITH THAT. 
WE WANT THEM IN ON THIS. 
HAVING THOSE PEOPLE IN THERE IS 
SOMETHING THAT NORTH KOREA HAS 
TO AGREE TO. 
AND SO THEY MAY BE ABLE TO SAY, 
OH, YES TO THE AMERICANS, NO TO 
THE FRENCH. 
YES TO THE CHINESE, NO TO THE 
RUSSIANS, ALL THAT STUFF HAS TO 
BE NEGOTIATED. 
AND THAT IS WHERE IT CAN GET 
MESSY. 
KIM JONG-UN CAN DRAW THIS OUT 
FOR AS LONG AS HE WANTS. 
AND THAT IS THE RISK WITH 
DIPLOMACY, IT IS NOT WITHOUT A 
PRICE. 
>> INDEED. 
"FACE THE NATION" MODERATOR, 
OUR SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT, MARGARET 
BRENNAN, THANKS FOR BREAKING 
THIS DOWN FOR US. 
ED O'KEEFE, GREAT TO HAVE YOU 
ON CBSN. 
>>> MY COLLEAGUE ANNE MARIE

>>  THIS IS CBSN. 
WE'RE JUST ON THE FRONT LINES.

>>  IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT CAUSED 
THIS FIRE, WHY IT SPREAD SO 
QUICKLY. 
>>  THERE ARE FLOODED HOMES,

>>  CHANGE IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE

NOW, THEY ARE TRYING TO PIN THE 
ISIS GUNMAN DOWN. 
>>  THE MARCHERS ARE SAYING, 
LET US MARCH, WE WANT TO MARCH. 
>>  CBSN, CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>> A HISTORIC DAY FOR THE 
UNITED STATES, NORTH KOREA, IN 
FACT, FOR THE WORLD. 
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, A 
SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT MET WITH 
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, KIM JONG-UN, 
AND BOTH OF THEM RATHER HELD A 
SERIES OF MEETINGS OVERNIGHT IN 
SINGAPORE. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID KIM 
COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION. 
HE ALSO SAID THE U.S. WOULD 
STOP WAR GAMES WITH SOUTH 
KOREA. 
REPORTERS PRESSED MR. TRUMP ON 
THE LIST OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS, BUT EMPHASIZED 
DENUCLEARIZATION -- HE WOULD 
RATHER EMPHASIZE 
DENUCLEARIZATION WAS THE MAIN 
FOCUS OF THE TALKS. 
>>  THERE'S NO LIMIT TO WHAT 
NORTH KOREA CAN ACHIEVE WHEN IT 
GIVES UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
AND EMBRACES COMMERCE AND 
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE REST OF THE 
WORLD. 
THAT REALLY WANTS TO ENGAGE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM HAS BEFORE HIM AN 
OPPORTUNITY LIKE NO OTHER. 
TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE LEADER 
WHO USHERED IN A GLORIOUS NEW 
ERA OF SECURITY AND PROSPERITY 
FOR HIS PEOPLE. 
CHAIRMAN KIM AND I JUST SIGNED 
A JOINT STATEMENT IN WHICH HE 
REAFFIRMED HIS UNWAIVERRING 
COMMITMENT TO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAEN 
PENINSULA. 
WE ALSO AGREED TO VIGOROUS 
NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE 
AGREEMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
AND HE WANTS TO DO THAT. 
>>  CBS NEWS STATE DEPARTMENT 
REPORTER IS WITH ME NOW FROM 
SINGAPORE. 
SO, KILEY, WE KNOW THE 
PRESIDENT AND KIM JONG-UN 
SIGNED AN AGREEMENT THAT HAD 
FOUR COMPONENTS, BUT ALSO GAVE 
A LENGTHY PRESS CONFERENCE 
AFTERWARDS. 
CAN YOU SORT OF FLESH OUT WHAT 
WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT WHAT THE 
TWO LEADERS HAVE AGREED TO. 
>>  Reporter: BASICALLY, WHAT 
WE SAW TODAY WAS THAT THEY HAD 
A MEETING AND THEY AGREED TO 
WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY AGREED 
TO. 
THAT NORTH KOREA SAID IT WOULD 
DENUCLEARIZE, THAT THE U.S. 
WOULD PROVIDE NORTH KOREA WITH 
SECURITY ASSURANCES, AND THAT 
WAS BUILT ON A LITTLE BIT. 
IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE THAT 
YOU JUST PLAYED A LITTLE BIT 
OF, TRUMP SAID THAT THE U.S. 
WOULD STOP ITS WAR GAMES IN 
SOUTH KOREA. 
NOW THAT IS SIGNIFICANT, 
BECAUSE DID IS BASICALLY 
GIVING, YOU KNOW, NORTH KOREA A 
BIT OF A WIN ON THE BOARD. 
THEY VIEW THOSE EXERCISES THAT 
THE U.S. DOES IN THE REGION AS 
PROVOCATIVE AND TRUMP USED THAT 
WORD HIMSELF. 
WHAT WE DIDN'T GET FROM 
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS HOW DUH 
NUCLEARIZATION, HOW THIS 
PROCESS IS GOING TO OCCUR, WHEN 
IT'S GOING TO OCCUR, WHAT IT'S 
GOING TO LOOK LIKE. 
HE SAID IT WILL BE VERIFYABLE. 
THEY WILL GET A LOT OF 
INDIVIDUALS IN THERE TO CHECK 
OUT THESE SITES. 
BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE 
DETAILS OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO 
SHAPE UP. 
>>  AND YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK 
AT THE FOUR POINTS, THE 
DOCUMENT THAT THE TWO LEADERS 
SIGNED, THE WORD THAT IS USED 
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAEN 
PENINSULA IS REAFFIRMING, 
SUGGESTING THIS IS AN 
AFFIRMATION THAT HAS BEEN MADE 
BEFORE, AND NOTHING NEW. 
>>  Reporter: YEAH, EXACTLY. 
AND SO WE DID HEAR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAY THAT AN AGREEMENT 
THAT HE CAME TO WITH KIM JONG-
UN OUTSIDE OF THAT WRITTEN 
STATEMENT WAS THAT NORTH KOREA 
WAS GOING TO BLOW UP ONE OF THE 
-- DESTROY ONE OF ITS MISSILE 
ENGINE TESTING SITES. 
THAT IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION. 
IF NORTH KOREA IS GOING TO MOVE 
TOWARD DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THERE ARE AS MANY AS 100 SITES 
THAT WOULD NEED TO BE 
THOROUGHLY INSPECTED IN ORDER 
TO GET A COMPLETE ASSESSMENT OF 
WHAT THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
ARSENAL OF NORTH KOREA LOOKS 
LIKE. 
BECAUSE A LOT OF THAT IS 
UNKNOWN TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN, YOU KNOW, 
OUTSIDERS, INSPECTORS ON THE 
GROUND THERE IN YEARS NOW. 
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT HOW MUCH WORK IS IN FRONT 
OF US AS TRUMP, YOU KNOW, 
CLAIMS VICTORY HERE. 
WITH KIM JONG-UN, BUT STILL HAS 
A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. 
HE DID ADMIT THERE MIGHT BE 
ANOTHER SUMMIT, THEY MAY NEED 
TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS. 
SECRETARY OF STATE, MIKE 
POMPEO, JOHN BOLTON, TRUMP SAID 
WILL BOTH BE CONTINUING TO WORK 
ON THIS AND MEETING WITH NORTH 
KOREANS IN THE FUTURE. 
WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHEN 
THOSE MEETINGS WILL GET GOING 
AGAIN. 
>>  YOU ARE SO RIGHT. 
A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION 
LEADING UP TO THIS SUMMIT HAD 
TO DO WITH THE DEFINITIONS, HOW 
THE TWO LEADERS DEFINE 
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND OTHER 
AREAS OF CONCERN. 
IT SEEMS LIKE THAT CONVERSATION 
CONTINUES. 
YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU VERIFY? 
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE ARE WE 
TALKING ABOUT SITES IN WHICH 
NORTH KOREA IDENTIFIES 
LOCATIONS THAT THEY HAVE 
NUCLEAR STOCKPILE, OR OTHER 
LOCATIONS THAT PERHAPS, BASED 
ON OUR INTELLIGENCE, WE WANT TO 
TAKE A LOOK AT OR THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WANTS 
TO LOOK AT. 
IN TERMS OF THE WAR GAMES, 
SPECIFICALLY WHAT DOES THAT 
MEAN? 
NO WAR GAMES AT ALL? 
THESE WAR GAMES ARE ALL ABOUT 
MILITARY READINESS AND DEFENSE, 
SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU HAVE A 
MILITARY PRESENCE, BUT NO 
PRACTICE AT READINESS? 
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S STILL A 
LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS 
HERE. 
>>  Reporter: YEAH, I THINK 
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT. 
THERE ARE A LOT OF UNANSWERED 
QUESTIONS. 
BUT YOU KNOW, I WATCHED TRUMP 
AND KIM JONG-UN SHAKE HANDS 
THIS MORNING NEXT TO ONE OF CBS 
NEWS CONTRIBUTORS WHO HAS 
WORKED AT THE CIA AND THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT. 
HE SAID HE'S BEEN WAITING 40 
YEARS TO SEE A HANDSHAKE LIKE 
THAT BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES AND THE 
LEADER OF NORTH KOREA. 
SO, AGAIN, THERE IS SOME 
PROGRESS THAT WAS MADE HERE. 
YOU CAN'T UNDERMINE THAT. 
BUT, IN TERMS OF THESE 
NEGOTIATORS THAT HAVE BEEN 
WORKING TO TRY AND COME TO SOME 
SORT OF CONCRETE PLAN FORWARD, 
WELL WE DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF 
THAT THEY HAVE GOTTEN ANYWHERE. 
WE HAD KIM WHO IS NOW THE U.S. 
AMBASSADOR TO THE PHILIPPINES, 
LEADING A DELEGATION FOR ABOUT 
TEN DAYS LEADING UP TO THIS 
SUMMIT TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND 
HOW THE U.S. AND NORTH KOREA 
CAN ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS. 
OBVIOUSLY, WITH THE AIM OF 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION, AND 
IF TODAY IS ANY TEST FOR WHAT 
THEY WERE ABLE TO AGREE TO, 
WELL IT'S NOT MUCH. 
THEY STILL ARE VERY FAR FROM 
ONE ANOTHER IN TERMS OF HOW 
THEY WILL GET TO AN END STATE. 
>>  YEAH, BUT PERHAPS WE HAVE 
TO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS 
PARTICULARLY HISTORIC. 
THIS IS FURTHER ALONG THAN MANY 
OF THE PAST ADMINISTRATIONS 
HAVE GOTTEN TO. 
AND THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGES 
THIS IS PART OF AN ON GOING 
CONVERSATION. 
THIS IS NOT THE BEGINNING, BY 
ANY MEANS AT ALL. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY LEFT. 
HE IS BACK ON HIS WAY. 
BACK HOME TO WASHINGTON. 
AFTER THIS HISTORIC COUPLE OF 
DAYS IN SINGAPORE. 
HE ADDRESSED REPORTERS ON BOARD 
AIR FORCE ONE EARLIER TO TALK 
ABOUT THE MEETING WITH KIM JONG-
UN. 
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. 
>>  I KNOW YOU SAID YOU 
COULDN'T GET EVERYTHING DONE 
YOU WANTED TO. 
>>  BASICALLY, GOING BACK TO 
THE HOTEL ROOM AND LEAVE 
TOMORROW. 
I WOULD RATHER FLY DURING THE 
NIGHT AND GET BACK. 
I HAD THE OPTION. 
YOU ALMOST DIDN'T, BECAUSE THEY 
WEREN'T PREPARED FOR THIS. 
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO LEAVE 
TOMORROW MORNING AT 7:00, AND 
INSTEAD, WE'RE LEAVING TONIGHT, 
SO WE'LL BE ARRIVING WHEN WE'RE 
SUPPOSED TO. 
>>  WHEN DID YOU LET THEM KNOW 
YOU WERE LEAVING? 
>>  HE WAS RIGHT ON TIME. 
HE WAS RIGHT ON TIME. 
>>   THERE WAS NOTHING MORE WE 
COULD HAVE DONE. 
>>  WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS? 
>>  I WONDER IF HE'S -- LET ME 
ASK YOU THIS. 
SIT DOWN AND HAVE A GOOD 
FLIGHT. 
>>  CAN YOU COME VISIT WITH US 
MORE LATER? 
IT'S A LONG FLIGHT. 
>>  IT'S 26 HOURS, YOU ARE 
VULNERABLE IN 26 HOURS. 
YOU BECOME  VULNERABLE. 
STEVE WILL ASK ME ANOTHER 
QUESTION. 
>>  HOW IS THE FIRST LADY 
DOING? 
>>  SHE'S DOING GREAT. 
>>  SHE IS NOT SUPPOSED TO FLY. 
IN FACT, SHE WAS HANDING OUT 
THE AWARD LAST NIGHT. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY LINGERING 
CONCERNS ABOUT? 
>>  I CAN ONLY TELL YOU FROM 
THE TIME I DEALT WITH HIM, 
WHICH IS STARTING 90 DAYS AGO, 
IT'S BEEN VERY STRONG. 
I THINK HE WANTS TO GET IT 
DONE. 
AND WE SHOULD ALL WANT THAT TO 
HAPPEN. 
>>  EVEN A TINY BET OF YOU IS 
NOT DISAPPOINTED? 
>>  WE SET UP A PLATFORM. 
HE UNDERSTOOD. 
THE REMAINS, I ASKED HIM, SO 
MANY PEOPLE ASK ME THAT. 
THEIR SONS, THEIR FATHERS, SO 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME ABOUT 
THAT. 
I WOULD SAY TO MYSELF, AS SOON 
AS I HAVE MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY, 
COULD YOU DO WHAT HE SAID WE 
WILL DO? 
>>  AND HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE 
YOU GET PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE HE 
DENUCLEARIZES? 
>>  WE WILL CHECK IT. 
WE'LL CHECK IT STRONGLY. 
HE HAS A PLAN, TOTAL, AND 
COMPLETE. 
>>  YOU TRUST HIM? 
>>  I DO. 
AS I TOLD YOU. 
>>  THE TOTAL PLAN FOR TOTAL 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
HE HAS A TOTAL PLAN? 
>>  YES. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT. 
>>  SO THAT'S WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD TO SAY ABOUT THIS 
HISTORIC MEETING ON HIS WAY 
BACK TO WASHINGTON ON AIR FORCE 
ONE, THAT HE TOTALLY TRUSTS KIM 
JONG-UN AND BELIEVES HE HAS A 
TOTAL PLAN FOR A COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A LOT OF 
THINGS UP IN THE AIR ABOUT WHAT 
THAT MEANS. 
LIVE WE'VE BEEN SAYING, THIS IS 
HISTORIC, THIS IS FURTHER ALONG 
THAN ANY OTHER ADMINISTRATION 
MANAGED TO GET TO. 
WE WANT TO BRING IN AP'S WHITE 
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, ZEEK 
MILLER. 
YOU'RE IN SINGAPORE. 
YOU'RE ON THE PHONE JOINING US 
NOW. 
THE PRESIDENT GAVE A REALLY 
LENGTHY INTERVIEW AND HE 
REENFORCED SOME OF WHAT HE HAD 
TO SAY IN THAT INTERVIEW ON AIR 
FORCE ONE. 
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT HE  
TRUSTS KIM JONG-UN, WHEN ASKED 
ABOUT VERIFICATION IN THAT 
PRESS CONFERENCE, HE SAID 
ESSENTIALLY, HE TRUSTED HIS GUT 
AND HIS INSTINCT. 
IS THAT ENOUGH? 
>>  Reporter: THAT IS NOT 
ENOUGH AT THE END OF THE DAY. 
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 
INSTINCT. 
IT WILL HAVE EVERYTHING TO DO 
WITH THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
IF NORTH KOREA IS BELIEVED TO 
HAVE BETWEEN 50 AND 60 ACTIVE 
WARHEADS, DO THEY LEAVE THE 
COUNTRY? 
THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT 
WILL DETERMINE SUCCESS OR 
FAILURE OF THIS SUMMIT. 
ULTIMATELY BY THE PRESIDENT, HE 
SAID COMPLETE VERIFYABLE, 
IRREVERSIBLE THE BE ALL AND END 
ALL FOR THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. 
IF HE CANNOT GET THERE, YES, IT 
WILL TAKE SOME TIME, BUT IF HE 
CAN'T GET THERE, ALL OF THIS 
WILL BE FOR NOT, BECAUSE WE SAW 
A LITTLE DURING THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE, SAYING YOU KNOW, IF 
IN SIX MONTHS, HE IS SAYING 
THIS WAS A FAILURE, HE-WRONG, 
HE WOULD COME UP WITH AN 
EXCUSE. 
>>  YEAH, HE DID. 
YOU KNOW, THE FOUR POINT 
DOCUMENT GAVE US INFORMATION, 
BUT HE REVEALED A LOT MORE IN 
HIS PRESS CONFERENCE. 
PERHAPS, PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN 
CAUGHT OFF GUARD WHEN HE TALKED 
ABOUT HIS INTENTION OR DESIRE 
TO MOVE U.S. TROOPS OUT OF 
SOUTH KOREA AND THEN HIS 
INTENTION TO END THE WAR GAMES. 
BUT THERE'S STILL QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THAT, SPECIFICALLY, WHAT 
DOES THAT MEAN AND IT'S MY 
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU KNOW, 
THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE TO DO 
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP THAT THE 
U.S. HAS WITH SOUTH KOREA AND 
NOT AN AGREEMENT WITH NORTH 
KOREA AT ALL. 
>>  THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. 
THE CLEAR THING ABOUT TODAY, 
THE BIGGEST TAKE AWAY, WE HAVE 
MORE QUESTIONS TODAY THAN WE 
HAD YESTERDAY. 
WE HAD MORE QUESTIONS ASKED. 
>>  YEAH, INDEED. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE 
QUESTIONS. 
CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, THE 
REMOVAL OF TROOPS, THE POSSIBLE 
REMOVAL OF TROOPS, THE ENDING 
OF THESE WAR GAMES. 
>>  CERTAINLY -- 
>>  SORRY, GO AHEAD. 
>>  WHEN IT COMES TO WAR GAMES, 
THAT IS SOMETHING I WILL 
CERTAINLY QUESTION U.S. 
ALLIANCES AROUND THE WORLD. 
THE SOUTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT 
WANTS TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT. 
AND THAT'S SOMETHING MEMBERS OF 
THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY BACK 
IN WASHINGTON WILL WANT TO HEAR 
MORE ABOUT, THEY WERE WARNING 
THE PRESIDENT NOT TO GIVE UP IN 
THE INITIAL AGREEMENT AND 
MAKING A FREEZE LIKE THAT, AND 
EMBRACING HIS RHETORIC, IS NOT 
A CONCESSION TO KIM JONG-UN. 
THAT THE PRESIDENT REALLY 
HASN'T GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT FOR. 
MAYBE IF THIS THING ULTIMATELY 
GETS THROUGH, IT WILL HAVE 
WORKED. 
IT'S A MASS UV RISK IVE RISK BY 
THE PRESIDENT. 
>>  COMPLETE, VERIFYABLE, 
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THAT'S THE PHRASE WE HEARD OVER 
AND OVER AGAIN. 
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T 
BRING IT UP IN HIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE EITHER. 
SO, THERE ARE A LOT OF OPEN 
ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW DO 
YOU VERIFY? 
THE PRESIDENT COULDN'T ANSWER 
THAT QUESTION IN HIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
WHEN IT COMES TO LOOKING INTO 
SUSPECT SITES, DO WE GO BY WHAT 
THE NORTH KOREANS WANT TO 
ACKNOWLEDGE OR DO WE GO BY WHAT 
LIMITED INTELLIGENCE MAY BE 
SUGGESTING ARE SITES OF 
CONCERN? 
THERE'S ALSO SORTS OF THINGS 
THAT ARE OPEN ENDED HERE. 
>>  THE PRESIDENT ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT U.S. INTELLIGENCE LIMITED, 
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW, IT'S A 
VAST PROGRAM THAT IS WELL 
DEVELOPED AND HAS BEEN WELL 
DEVELOPED -- DESIGNED TO EVADE 
DETECTION FOR DECADES. 
THIS WILL BE A LARGE ENDEAVOR. 
WITH THAT, SAYING THEY WILL BE 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO IN. 
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT HAS NOT BEEN WORKED OUT IN 
THE EAST. 
THIS HAS BEEN WORKED OUT IN THE 
PAST AND OTHER AGREEMENTS THAT 
HAVE ULTIMATELY FALLEN APART, 
THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT 
THAT'S THE SORT OF DETAIL HE 
WAS GOING TO LEAVE TO HIS 
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM, EITHER 
JOHN BOLTON, MIKE POMPEO, AND 
OTHERS THAT WILL TALK TO THE 
NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPARTS NEXT 
WEEK. 
>>  SOME OBSERVERS MAY BE 
DISAPPOINTED IN, THE LIMITED 
DISCUSSION ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID IT CAME UP, 
BUT IT CERTAINLY WASN'T A TOP 
PRIORITY IN THE CONVERSATION. 
HE CREDITED OTTO AS BEING PART 
OF THE CATALYST FOR THE 
DISCUSSIONS AND FOR THE SUMMIT. 
SAYING YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T DIE 
IN VAIN. 
BUT, WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS KIND OF 
RECEIVE SUCH LITTLE TIME WITH 
THIS SUMMIT? 
>>  IT'S REALLY NOT SURPRISING, 
IF YOU LOOK THE WAY THE 
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THESE 
ISSUES. 
IT'S OVER THE COURSE OF HIS 
CANDIDACY, YOU KNOW, THE 
PRESIDENT TAKING ON A VERY 
NARROW VIEW OF WHAT IS AMERICAN 
INTEREST AND HE MADE HIS 
CAMPAIGN PROMISE, AMERICA 
FIRST. 
EMBRACED THAT TOWARD THE END OF 
HIS CAMPAIGN. 
THE WAY HE VIEWED AMERICAN 
INTEREST, HUMAN RIGHTS IS NOT 
PART OF AMERICAN INTEREST. 
IT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OF THE WEST 
QUARTERS, MEANS IT'S NOT OUR 
PROBLEM. 
THAT MEANS THAT THE PRESIDENT 
DOESN'T BELIEVE HE HAS TO RAISE 
THOSE ISSUES. 
BUT THE SAME FORCE, AS OTHER 
PRESIDENTS WHO TRIED TO PROTECT 
THE MORAL AUTHORITY OF THE 
UNITED STATES, THAT'S NOT HIS 
JOB, IF YOU CAN OBTAIN PROGRESS 
ON A NUCLEAR QUESTION, HE CAN 
GIVE KIM THE VICTORY OF THAT 
PHOTO OP, SAYING MAYBE HE'S 
GOING TO SAVE AS MANY AS 30 
MILLION LIVES. 
THAT ALSO APPLIES TO NOT 
BRINGING UP ISSUES, LIKE HUMAN 
RIGHTS LIKE THAT, WHERE THE 
PRESIDENT IS WILLING TO MAKE 
THE CHALLENGING COMPROMISES. 
AND IT'S NOT THAT OTHER 
PRESIDENTS HAVEN'T HAD TO MAKE 
THOSE COMPROMISES, SHOW ALL OF 
HIS CARDS, BUT THERE'S NO HINT 
OF ANY WANDERY HERE. 
THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T FEEL THE 
NEED TO RAISE THOSE ISSUES. 
>>  I THINK PART OF WHAT MADE 
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE SO 
REMARKABLE IS YEAH, THE 
PRESIDENT CERTAINLY WAS PRETTY 
DIRECT ABOUT IT AND 
UNAPOLOGETIC ABOUT SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT THEY DISCUSSED AND 
HIS PERSPECTIVE AND POINT OF 
VIEW. 
IT WENT ON FOR OVER AN HOUR. 
HE TOOK QUESTIONS FROM 
JOURNALISTS, INCLUDING 
JOURNALISTS THAT REPRESENT 
PUBLICATIONS OR BROADCASTS THAT 
HE CONSIDERS UNFAVORABLE TO 
HIM. 
HE CERTAINLY WAS FEELING VERY 
GOOD ABOUT THIS SUMMIT. 
>>  YOU KNOW, THE REALLY BIG 
TAKE AWAY FROM THAT, THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE IS GOOD. 
DOES HE HAVE REASON TO? 
HE DID HAVE THIS BIG MOMENT ON 
THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE, BUT 
SOMETHING THAT IS TOO SOON TO 
TELL. 
IN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS, THIS 
COULD TURN OUT TO BE A MASSIVE 
REGRET. 
STOCKPILED, MISSILE PROGRAM 
GROWTH MORE ADVANCED. 
THAT IS A RISK HERE THAT THE 
PRESIDENT IS TAKING. 
IT LOOKED LIKE HE HAD BEEN 
PLAYED THE MASTER DEAL MAKER. 
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES HE HAS 
ASSURANCES. 
NORTH KOREA HAS GIVEN 
ASSURANCES BEFORE AND HAS GONE 
BACK ON THEM. 
THE PRESIDENT BELIEVES THIS 
TIME IS DIFFERENT. 
WE DON'T SEE THE EVIDENCE OF 
THAT RIGHT NOW, OTHER THAN THIS 
FACE TO FACE MEETING BETWEEN 
THE PRESIDENT AND THE NORTH 
KOREAN LEADER. 
THAT IS NOT THE TYPE OF THING 
YOU WOULD THINK ON. 
>>  SPEAKING OF TRACK RECORDS, 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN, 
IN THE PAST, PARTICULARLY 
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA 
AFTER HE REACHED OUT TO CUBA, 
CRITICAL OF PRESIDENT OBAMA 
WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD BE 
WILLING TO SPEAK WITH NO 
PRECONDITIONS. 
WE ARE GETTING A DIFFERENT FEEL 
HERE IN REGARDS TO PRESIDENT 
TRUMP. 
THERE IS NO SURPRISE IN TERMS 
OF THAT. 
IF THIS SHOULD NOT PAN OUT, DO 
YOU EXPECT THAT THE PRESIDENT 
WILL HEAR SOME HARSH WORDS FROM 
HIS OWN PARTY? 
>>  I THINK THERE WILL 
CERTAINLY BE HARSH WORDS FROM 
THE PRESIDENT'S OWN PARTY. 
TEMPERED WORDS. 
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE, THE 
RELATION OF SOUTH KOREA, THE 
PRESIDENT -- THE JOUR ALL  -- 
IN AMERICAN POLITICS. 
AND THAT IS THE TRUE POLITICAL 
FACT THERE, IF THIS DOESN'T 
SEEM TO BE GOING VERY WELL, IF 
NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO GO BACK ON 
SOME COMMITMENTS, YOU'LL SEE 
MORE CRITICISM. 
BY AND LARGE, THE POLITICAL 
PARTY WILL STAY WITH HIM, 
BECAUSE THAT'S THE NATURE OF 
AMERICAN POLITICS TODAY. 
>>  ZEEK MILLER FROM A.P., 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
I WANT TO THANK KILEY ATWOOD AS 
WELL. 
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK 
WITH BEN TRACY. 
HE IS STANDING BY IN SINGAPORE. 
>>> THERE YOU HAVE A LOOK AT 
SINGAPORE. 
BEAUTIFUL SINGAPORE. 
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS WELL 
ON HIS WAY TO WASHINGTON, 
HAVING LEFT HISTORIC SUMMIT IN 
SINGAPORE. 
AND  NORTH KOREAN LEADER ALSO 
HEADED BACK TO NORTH KOREA. 
AFTER WHAT MANY HAVE CALLED 
REMARKABLE, SURPRISING, AND 
CERTAINLY HISTORIC TALKS. 
CBS NEWS FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, 
BEN TRACY, IS JOINING ME NOW 
FROM SINGAPORE. 
BEN, YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN 
NORTH KOREA. 
YOU WERE THERE WHEN THE NORTH 
KOREANS DESTROYED, WHAT THEY 
SAID WAS DESTROYING A NUCLEAR 
TEST SITE. 
AND NOW, WE'RE HEARING THERE IS 
SOME SORT OF COMMITMENT TO 
CONTINUE THAT PROCESS OF 
DENUCLEARIZING THE KOREAEN 
PENINSULA. 
BUT THE QUESTION OF 
VERIFICATION HAS COME UP. 
WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING THAT 
TEST SITE BEING DESTROYED, THEY 
DID NOT ALLOW ANY EXPERTS THERE 
TO WITNESS IT. 
SO ESSENTIALLY, IT WAS A NUMBER 
OF JOURNALISTS WHO KNOW A LOT, 
BUT NOT NECESSARILY ENOUGH 
ABOUT NUCLEAR SITES TO KNOW 
WHETHER THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT 
OR WHETHER OR NOT THAT SITE WAS 
DESTROYED. 
>>  Reporter: I WILL FULLY 
ADMIT I DO NOT HAVE THE SKILLS 
TO VERIFY THE DECERTIFY CATION 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF A TEST 
SITE. 
ALL WE COULD TELL WERE THE 
ENTRANCES OF THE TUNNELS WERE 
BLOWN UP. 
IF THE TUNNELS THAT STRETCH 
MILES INTO THOSE MOUNTAINS 
AREN'T ACTUALLY DESTROYED, THEY 
COULD BRING THAT SITE BACK 
ONLINE AND THEORETICALLY, START 
TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS THERE 
AGAIN. 
BUT THE NORTH KOREANS DID VIEW 
THAT AS A DOWN PAYMENT, A GOOD 
FAITH EFFORT TO SHOW THEY PLAN 
TO DISMANTEL THEIR PROGRAM. 
IF THEY DON'T ALLOW IN 
INSPECTORS TO VERIFY THAT THIS 
HAS BEEN DONE, WE WILL NEVER 
KNOW IF NORTH KOREA HAS TAKEN 
THE STEPS. 
THAT IS THE PROBLEM COMING OUT 
OF THE SUMMIT TODAY. 
THERE IS THIS VAGUE PLEDGE OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THE WORD REITERATES ITS 
COMMITMENT. 
NORTH KOREA HAS SAID THIS 
BEFORE. 
ARE THEY GOING TO ALLOW 
INSPECTORS IN TO VERIFY THAT 
THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY 
DESTROYED? 
>>  INDEED. 
I THINK ONE OF THE MORE 
SURPRISING THINGS TO COME OUT 
OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE,  HIS 
DESIRE TO REMOVE AMERICAN 
TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA AND HIS 
WILLINGNESS TO STOP THOSE WAR 
GAMES. 
THESE ARE WAR GAMES THAT THE 
NORTH KOREANS HAVE CALLED 
PROVOCATIVE AND THAT THE 
PRESIDENT ALSO CALLED 
PROVOCATIVE, TODAY, WHICH IS 
SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM 
AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT BEFORE. 
TELL ME THE SIGNIFICANCE OF 
THAT. 
>>  Reporter: IT WAS STUNNING. 
HE BASICALLY ADOPTED NORTH 
KOREA'S LANGUAGE ON THOSE 
MILITARY EXERCISES. 
THE UNITED STATES HAS GONE TO 
GREAT PAINS OVER A VERY LONG 
PERIOD OF TIME, DECADES, TO 
CALL THOSE JOINT MILITARY 
EXERCISE AND TO STRESS THEY 
ARE DEFENSIVE IN NATURE. 
THEY ARE ABOUT MAKING SURE THE 
AMERICAN TROOPS THAT ARE 
STATIONED THERE ON THE KOREAEN 
PENINSULA ARE PREPARED IF NORTH 
KOREA WERE TO TAKE SOME SORT OF 
ACTION OR ANOTHER CONFLICT IN 
THE REGION. 
FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES TO BASICALLY CALL THEM 
WAR GAMES AND CALL THEM 
PROVOCATIVE, THAT'S WHAT NORTH 
KOREA AND CHINA CALL THEM. 
FOR HIM TO SAY THEY WILL NO 
LONGER TAKE PLACE, CAN ONLY BE 
VIEWED AS A CONCESSION. 
IT'S A FAIRLY BIG ONE, BECAUSE 
IT HAS LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. 
YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SAY HE 
WOULD LOVE TO BRING ALL THOSE 
TROOPS HOME. 
HE DOESN'T SEE WHY WE SHOULD BE 
SPENDING THE MONEY TO HAVE THEM 
THERE. 
TO PROVIDE CONTEXT, THOSE 
TROOPS AREN'T THERE BECAUSE OF 
NORTH KOREA. 
THAT STARTED AT THE END OF THE 
KOREAEN WAR. 
THEY ARE THERE AS A BUFFER FOR 
CHINA, WHICH IS SPREADING THEIR 
MILITARY POWER IN THE ASIA, 
PACIFIC REGION. 
IF THE UNITED STATES PULLS OUT, 
THAT SEEDS THAT TO CHINA AND 
THERE IS NO COMPETITION IN THIS 
SPACE THAT COULD TAKE ON A 
COUNTRY AS POWERFUL CHINA NOW 
IS. 
>>  A GOOD REMINDER THAT THOUGH 
THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION HAS 
BEEN ABOUT THE U.S. AND ITS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA. 
THERE ARE OTHER IMPORTANT 
PLAYERS, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA, 
JAPAN, AND RUSSIA LOOKING ON. 
BEN TRACY IN SINGAPORE, THANK 
YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> WE WANT TO TURN TO CBS 
EVENING NEWS ANCHOR, JEFF GLOR. 
JEFF IS ALSO IN SINGAPORE. 
JEFF, THIS IS REALLY BEEN A 
REMARKABLE MOMENT TO WITNESS.
I DON'T THINK WE CAN SORT OF 
OVERSTATE THE HISTORIC 
SIGNIFICANCE HERE. 
A NUMBER OF ADMINISTRATIONS HAD 
TRIED TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS 
WAY. 
THIS IS THE FURTHEST AN 
AMERICAN PRESIDENT AND AN 
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION HAS 
GOTTEN SO FAR. 
>>  Reporter: YEAH, A BIT OF A 
WHIPLASH HERE. 
SO, BOTH SHOWS HAVE LEFT TOWN. 
THEY SWEPT IN QUICKLY. 
THIS SUMMIT WAS FIVE HOURS 
LONG. 
THERE WAS THAT 45 MINUTE 
MEETING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP 
AND KIM JONG-UN SOLO WITH THE 
TRANSLATERS. 
A NUMBER OF HANDSHAKES. 
THERE WAS A DISCUSSION AT THE 
TABLE. 
WE SAW THE SIGNATURES. 
THAT WAS THE THEATER OF ALL 
THIS. 
AND THEN THE SIGNED AGREEMENT. 
IS SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN IT 
STRONG? 
YES. 
IS IT ALSO VAGUE? 
YES. 
SO, I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT, WE 
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM KIM JONG-UN, 
OTHER THAN HIM CALLING IT A 
SCENE FROM A SCIENCE FICTION 
MOVIE, WHICH TO MANY, IT 
APPEARED THAT WAY. 
IT WAS CERTAINLY SURREAL IN 
MANY WAYS TO WATCH THIS HAPPEN. 
IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
SAYS IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, 
THERE'S TALK ABOUT MORE 
DISCUSSIONS NEXT WEEK AND THEN 
DOWN THE ROAD, IT'S POTENTIALLY 
A VISIT FROM KIM JONG-UN TO THE 
U.S. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE 
WOULD BE WELCOME AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED ABOUT 
WHETHER HE WOULD GO TO NORTH 
KOREA. 
HE SAID YES, AT SOME POINT, HE 
MIGHT. 
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
RIGHT AWAY. 
>>  YOU TALK ABOUT SURREAL AND 
YOU MENTIONED KIM JONG-UN 
COMING TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE TWO 
MEN WENT TO CHECK OUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S CAR, LIKE SORT OF 
BUDDIES ALMOST. 
SO, MOVING FORWARD THOUGH, THIS 
IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE 
CONVERSATION. 
WE REALLY HAVE SOME VAGUE 
ASSERTIONS THAT THE TWO LEADERS 
SIGNED. 
DETAILS ARE SPARSE. 
>>  Reporter: YES, SO 
VERIFYABLE IS THE BIG WORD WHEN 
IT COMES TO TAKING THE NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS OUT OF A COUNTRY WHICH 
IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY 
COMPLICATED PROCESS. 
ALSO, HAS DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS 
DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING 
TO. 
SO, THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF  
THE KEYS HERE. 
NORTH KOREA WANTS PEACE, 
RECOGNITION, SOVEREIGNTY. 
THE U.S.  WANTS 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF THAT 
TALKING PROCESS NOW. 
YES, WAS IT DONE WHEN YOU TALK 
ABOUT NORMAL DIPLOMATIC TERMS. 
WAS IT DONE IN AN UPSIDE DOWN 
PROCESS? 
YES, THIS HAPPENED VERY 
QUICKLY. 
YOU TALK TO THE FOLKS WHO 
HANDLE NEGOTIATIONS LIKE THIS, 
OR WHO WATCH NEGOTIATIONS LIKE 
THIS, AND THEY TALK ABOUT A 
SUMMIT LIKE THE WHERE YOU KNOW 
WE JUST SAW HERE WOULD BE A 
YEAR, TWO YEARS IN THE FUTURE. 
THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT PLAYED 
OUT THIS TIME. 
THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WON'T 
WORK. 
IT DOES MEAN IN TERMS OF THE 
NITTY-GRITTY, AND TRYING TO 
FIGURE ALL THIS OUT RIGHT NOW, 
THERE IS A LOT TO BE DONE. 
>>  DEFINITELY. 
NOT JUST VERIFICATION, BUT ALSO 
TIME LINE. 
WE DIDN'T GET A SENSE OF WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT MEANT BY 
DENUCLEARIZATION, WOULD HAPPEN 
QUICKLY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, 
TAKE SOME TIME. 
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHEN THE FINISH 
LINE WILL OCCUR FOR THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>>  Reporter: NO, WE DON'T HAVE 
A TIME LINE ON A LOT OF IT. 
WHEN THE EXERCISES EXACTLY WILL 
STOP. 
WHEN THE NEXT DISCUSSIONS WITH 
SOUTH KOREA, WITH JAPAN, WITH 
CHINA, WHEN ALL THAT MIGHT 
HAPPEN. 
WHEN THE NEXT MEETING WILL 
HAPPEN. 
BUT YES, THE BIG TIMETABLE IS 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. 
DOESN'T HAPPEN IN A WEEK. 
COULD IT HAPPEN IN THREE OR 
FOUR YEARS? 
SOME SAY IT COULD. 
OTHERS SAY IT'S MORE OF A 10 TO 
15 YEARLONG PROCESS. 
THAT'S A LONG TIME. 
YOU ARE TALKING 10 TO 15 YEARS, 
YOU'RE TALKING WELL BEYOND A 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 
EVEN IF HE WINS A SECOND TERM. 
IF IT CONTINUES ON HERE, BY 
MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS OVER 
THAT COURSE. 
>>  CBS EVENING NEWS ANCHOR, 
JEFF GLOR, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
FOR TAKING TIME OUT TO TALK TO 
US. 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 
REPORTING. 
WITH ME NOW IS CBS NEWS SENIOR 
GLOBAL AFFAIRS CONTRIBUTOR, 
IAN. 
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO TALK TO 
YOU. 
YOU'VE BEEN NECK DEEP IN THIS 
STUFF FOR YEARS. 
WE TALKED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 
CERTAIN KEYWORDS. 
AND WE DON'T KNOW THE 
DEFINITION. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT VERIFICATION 
MEANS. 
WE KNOW WHAT IT MEANS  MEANS 
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS FOR 
KIM JONG-UN. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO 
CURTAIL OR SHUT DOWN THESE WAR 
GAMES. 
WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT MEAN? 
ABSOLUTELY NO READINESS FOR OUR 
TROOPS IN THE REGION? 
DEFINITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT 
HERE. 
>>  I THINK THE SUSPENSION OF 
BIG JOINT EXERCISE IS SOMETHING 
WE TALKED ABOUT. 
NOT ONLY ARE THEY PROVOCATIVE. 
THAT CLEARLY SOUNDS LIKE A GIVE 
AWAY TO THE NORTH KOREANS AND 
THE CHINESE. 
I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST, 
CONCRETE THINGS THAT HAPPENED 
HERE, ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT 
THEY MET, IS THAT THE CHINESE, 
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, SAID THE 
WAY FORWARD WITH PEACE IS THE 
NORTH KOREAENS SUSPEND THEIR 
MISSILE AND NUCLEAR TESTING IN 
RETURN FOR THE AMERICANS 
FREEZING MILITARY EXERCISES. 
A FREEZE FOR FREEZE. 
AND THE AMERICANS, INCLUDING 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, SAID 
THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. 
OBAMA NEVER WANTED TO GO THERE. 
NOW. 
>>  WHAT IS THE POINT OF HAVING 
TROOPS IF THEY ARE NOT 
PRACTICED AND READY TO BE 
DEPLOYED? 
>>  YOU STILL WANT TROOPS 
THERE. 
TE POINT OF HAVING TROOPS, YOU 
ROTATE THEM OUT. 
THESE THINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT, 
AND TRIP WIRE. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THE CHINESE, 
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE PREVENTED 
FROM ENGAGING IN AGGRESSION, 
BECAUSE IF ANYTHING SPIRALS OUT 
OF CONTROL, THERE'S AMERICAN 
MILITARY THAT ARE GOING TO 
ACTUALLY HAVE THEIR BLOOD 
SPILLED. 
THE AMERICANS WOULD HAVE TO 
ESCALATE. 
THAT IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT IT'S A 
GIVE. 
ANOTHER BIG GIVE IS THE FACT 
THAT THE UNITED STATES IS NOW 
PROACTIVELY TALKING ABOUT MAYBE 
WE DON'T NEED THESE TROOPS IN 
SOUTH KOREA. 
30,000 TROOPS, THEY ARE 
EXPENSIVE. 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE OFF 
SANCTIONS UNTIL THERE IS 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
WE AREN'T GOING TO TAKE THE 
TROOPS OUT UNTIL THERE'S 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
YOU CAN WORK YOUR WAY DOWN THE 
PROCESS. 
IT FELT LIKE IN THE CONCRETE 
LANGUAGE HERE, TRUMP WAS DOING 
A LOT MORE GIVING THAN KIM JONG-
UN ACTUALLY WAS. 
LOOK, THIS IS CLEARLY A 
HISTORIC SUMMIT. 
IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR THE WORLD. 
YOU AND I WERE SITTING HERE 
TALKING A FEW MONTHS AGO. 
IT WAS ONE IN FIVE, ONE IN 
THREE TWO LIKELIHOOD, WE WERE 
GOING TO END UP IN A LIKELIHOOD 
IN THE NEAR TERM IS EFFECTIVELY 
ZERO. 
SO THAT'S A BIG WIN. 
RIGHT? 
LET'S NOT LOSE  SIGHT OF THAT. 
IF YOU LOSE OVER THE LONGER 
TERM, WHAT ASIA IS MORE LIKELY 
TO LOOK LIKE, IT IS DOMINATED 
BY THE CHINESE. 
THAT WAS THE CASE OF THE 
SUMMIT, BUT THIS SUMMIT AND THE 
OUTCOME, SORT OF SPED THAT 
PROCESS ALONG A LITTLE BIT. 
>>  THE POSSIBILITY OF REMOVING 
U.S. TROOPS, THAN DEFINITELY. 
YOU KNOW ONE THING I DIDN'T SEE 
AND DIDN'T HEAR MUCH OF, THAT 
THE PRESIDENT PROMISED BEFORE 
WAS SOME LEVEL OF SECURITY 
ASSURANCES FOR KIM JONG-UN. 
THAT DIDN'T COME UP, I DON'T 
THINK. 
>>  NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY 
CONCRETE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT 
SECURITY ASSURANCES WOULD LOOK 
LIKE. 
ASHIED FROM ASIDE FROM THE FACT 
THAT WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT 
PUTTING AN EMBASSY. 
THAT WAS DISCUSSED. 
AND WE DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT 
WE WANT A FORMAL END TO THE 
KOREAEN WAR. 
AND ASSUMING WE GET THERE, THAT 
WOULD BE SOME KIND OF A 
SYMBOLIC GUARANTEE. 
BUT LOOK, TRUMP BARELY PREPARED 
FOR THIS MEETING. 
SO THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE GOING 
TO WORK OUT THOSE KINDS OF 
DETAILS REALLY HARD TO IMAGINE. 
AND NORTH KOREA WANTED ALL THE 
TRAPPINGS OF THE SUMMIT, WANTED 
THE LEGITIMACY THAT COMES WITH 
THE FLAGS SIDE BY SIDE, BEING 
SEEN AS AN EQUAL ON THAT STAGE, 
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING 
SPECIFIC. 
I SAW NOTHING FROM THE SUMMIT 
THAT THE NORTH KOREANS GAVE THE 
AMERICANS THAT THEY HADN'T 
ALREADY SAID IN THEIR SUMMIT 
WITH PRESIDENT MOON OF SOUTH 
KOREA. 
THE FIRST SUMMIT. 
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE IS 
THAT KIM JONG-UN CLEARLY DOES 
WANT TO REACH OUT. 
HE'S ENGAGED NOW WITH THE 
CHINESE. 
THEY HAD TWO MEETINGS. 
TWO WARM AND MEANINGFUL SUMMITS 
WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN 
PRESIDENT. 
HE HAD A BREAKTHROUGH SUMMIT 
WITH THE AMERICANS. 
HE TRAVELED THERE NEXT WEEK. 
RELATIVELY SHORT ORDER. 
BEFORE THE FIRE AND FURY 
COMMENTS FROM TRUMP. 
THE ONLY FOREIGN LEADER THAT 
KIM JONG-UN EVER MET WAS DENNIS 
RODMAN. 
SO, WE'VE COME AN AWFUL LONG 
WAY, AND YOU KNOW, IF WE SAY 
THAT TRUMP IS THIS LEADER THAT 
NO ONE ELSE WOULD HAVE GONE 
HALF WAY AROUND THE WORLD, AND 
SAID THE KIND OF NICE THINGS 
ABOUT KIM JONG-UN THAT TRUMP 
HAS, THERE'S NO NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER THAT WE'VE SEEN, THAT 
WOULD HAVE ENGAGED IN THE OPEN 
DIPLOMACY. 
TRAVELING TO SINGAPORE, 
SMILING, ENGAGING, A SELFIE 
WITH THE SINGAPORE FOREIGN 
MINISTER, AND TALKING OPENLY 
ABOUT A MOVIE. 
HE CLEARLY IS MORE INTERESTED 
IN PROVIDING SOME ECONOMIC 
BENEFITS TO HIS PEOPLE THAN 
PREVIOUS NORTH KOREAN LEADERS 
HAVE. 
HAVING SAID THAT, HE'S THE GUY 
THAT KILLED OTTO, HAVING SAID 
THAT, HE'S ALSO THE GUY THAT IS 
LEADING THE WORLD'S LARGEST 
HUMAN CONCENTRATION CAMP. 
IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT. 
HE HAS ABSOLUTELY BEEN 
NORMALIZED THROUGH THIS 
PROCESS. 
>>  WELL, THAT IS THE FOLLOWUP 
QUESTION. 
DOES THIS SUMMIT MAKE IT OKAY 
FOR OTHER LEADERS TO MEET WITH 
HIM? 
WE KNOW ASSAD WILL MEET WITH 
HIM. 
THAT'S NOTHING STUNNING THERE, 
BUT, DOES THIS OPEN THE DOOR 
FOR OTHERS TO REACH OUT AND 
MAKE CONNECTIONS, DIPLOMATIC 
AND ECONOMIC CONNECTIONS? 
>>  I THINK THE MEETING WITH 
THE SOUTH KOREANS ALREADY DID 
THAT. 
THE MORE IMPORTANT POINT IS 
THAT TRUMP HAVING A VALUES FREE 
PRESIDENCY, WHERE HE ENGAGES 
WITH ANYONE, AS LONG AS HE CAN 
DO A DEAL MEANS THAT EVERY 
ROGUE STATE IS SOMEONE THAT CAN 
BE NORMALIZED. 
HE DOESN'T LIKE CUBA AND IRAN 
IN PART BECAUSE THOSE WERE 
OBAMA THINGS. 
AS OPPOSED TO A TRUMP THING. 
HE LIKES KIM JONG-UN, BECAUSE 
THAT'S A TRUMP THING. 
TRUMP WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MORE 
LIKELY PRESIDENT TO REACH OUT 
FOR CUBA. 
HE WANTED TO DO BUSINESS THERE 
BEFORE WITH THE TRUMP 
ORGANIZATION. 
HE TRIED TO GET IN. 
IF OBAMA HADN'T REACHED OUT TO 
CUBA, TRUMP WOULD HAVE TRIED 
THAT. 
OBAMA DID, AND WE HAVE TO UNDO 
EVERYTHING THAT OBAMA DID. 
SO, AS A CONSEQUENCE, TRUMP'S 
MOVE IS NORTH KOREA. 
>>  WHAT ABOUT THIS BUSINESS OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS? 
IT CAME UP BRIEFLY, BUT THAT 
WAS THAT HE MADE A LOT, AND 
IT'S SIGNIFICANT. 
HE MADE A LOT OF THE PROMISE TO 
RETURN THE REMAINS OF FALLEN 
SOLDIERS IN NORTH KOREA, BUT, 
YOU KNOW, HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS, IT'S HUGE. 
HE CREDITED OTTO'S DEATH AS 
IMPRISONMENT AND DEATH FOR 
BEING PART OF THE CATALYST 
TOWARDS THE SUMMIT, WHICH I 
SUPPOSE IS GOOD, BUT THE 
PREFERENCE IS THAT NO ONE WOULD 
END UP BEHIND BARS IN NORTH 
KOREA FOR ILLEGITIMATE REASONS 
AND WIND UP DEAD. 
>>  IT WAS HARD TO WATCH TRUMP 
TALK ABOUT OTTO, SAID HE HAD 
SPOKEN TO THE PARENTS, RIGHT 
THING TO DO. 
I THINK HE HANDLED THAT ABOUT 
AS WELL AS ANY PRESIDENT COULD, 
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHAT 
ACTUALLY HAPPENED. 
I'M GLAD IT WAS BROUGHT UP. 
BUT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. 
>>  BEFORE YOU GO AHEAD. 
LET'S PLAY THAT SOUND BYTE. 
IT HAPPENED IN THE WEE HOURS OF 
THE MORNING. 
>>  A VERY SPECIAL PERSON AND 
HE WILL BE FOR A LONG TIME IN 
MY LIFE. 
HIS PARENTS ARE GOOD FRIENDS OF 
MINE. 
I THINK WITHOUT HIM, THIS WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAPPENED. 
SOMETHING HAPPENED FROM THAT 
DAY. 
IT WAS A TERRIBLE THING. 
IT WAS BRUTAL. 
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTED TO 
FOCUS ON WHAT WAS GOING ON, 
INCLUDING NORTH KOREA. 
I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 
VAIN. 
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS. 
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN, AND I HAVE 
TO SAY, SPECIAL PARENTS. 
SPECIAL PEOPLE. 
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 
>>  I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WAS 
ASKED ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS AT THE TIME. 
HI PIVOTED TOWARDS OTTO. 
YOU KNOW, IT'S TRAGIC WHAT 
HAPPENED WITH HIM. 
BUT WE HAVE A WHOLE COUNTRY, 
NEARLY HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE 
BEHIND BARS IN NORTH KOREA FOR 
ESSENTIALLY OPPOSING THE 
GOVERNMENT. 
>>  LOOK, I MEAN THE DOWNSIDE 
OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING WITH 
THE NORTH KOREANS IS YOU OPEN 
YOURSELF UP TO ENGAGING, 
LEGITIMIZING AN INDIVIDUAL AND 
A REGIME THAT HAS COMMITTED 
UNSPEAKABLE HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS. 
I MEAN, THINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE 
TO IMAGINE. 
LET'S KEEP IN MIND, THE IRANIAN 
REGIME, WHICH IS NOT REPRESSIVE 
A NORTH KOREA. 
BUT IS PRETTY REPRESSIVE, IN 
TERMS OF TREATMENT OF 
HOMOSEXUALS AND ATROCITIES 
AGAINST JOURNALISTS. 
AMERICANS HAVE BEEN TORTURED. 
THEY SUPPORT TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS. 
WHEN OBAMA WAS WORKING THE 
NUCLEAR DEAL, THEY WEREN'T 
WORKING HUMAN RIGHTS. 
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD A LIST 
OF VIOLATORS, BUT THAT DID NOT 
STOP OBAMA -- THEY WERE HOPING 
BY DOING THAT EVENTUALLY, THEY 
COULD MOVE IRAN IN A DIRECTION 
THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO BE MORE 
FUNCTIONAL IN A COMMUNITY OF 
NATIONS. 
CERTAINLY, IT IS MORE LIKELY 
THAT BY THE UNITED STATES AND 
OTHERS ENGAGING NORTH  NORTH 
KOREA, THEY WILL OPEN UP 
ECONOMICALLY AND THAT OPENING 
WILL LEAD TO BETTER QUALITY OF 
LIFE. 
BETTER STANDARDS OF LIVING FOR 
THE TENS AND MILLIONS OF NORTH 
KOREANS LIVING IN THE MOST 
REPRESSIVE COUNTRY IN THE 
WORLD. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WILL 
CRITICIZE. 
COMING AFTER THIS SUMMIT, IF 
YOU LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING, THE POLARIZATION IS 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
FOR MANY, IT IS, THIS IS THE 
WORST DEAL TRUMP GAVE AWAY THE 
STORE, HOW COULD HE? 
OR TRUMP DESERVES A NOBEL PRIZE 
TODAY. 
I'VE SEEN THAT, TOO. 
THOSE ARE SILLY THINGS, BUT 
THEY REFLECT A COUNTRY, WHICH 
IS MORE DIVIDED THAN ANY POINT 
IN MY LIFE. 
THAT SPEAKS A LOT MORE TO THE 
REACTIONS THAN I THINK WHAT IS 
REALLY GOING ON HERE. 
WHICH IS THAT NORTH KOREA HAS A 
NEW LEADER AND THEY WANT TO 
ENGAGE MORE WITH THE REST OF 
THE WORLD. 
WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT GETS HIM. 
>>  DENNIS RODMAN CERTAINLY 
THINKS SO. 
>>  DENNIS RODMAN DIDN'T GET 
HIS SELFIE WITH THE TWO OF 
THEM. 
I THINK HE'S VERY DISAPPOINTED. 
>>  I'M SURE. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>  SO, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ON 
HIS WAY BACK TO WASHINGTON 
WHERE HE WILL FACE A LOT OF 
QUESTIONS FROM LAWMAKERS ON 
CAPITOL HILL. 
MARK BRENNAN IS STANDING BY 
WITH A LOOK AT HOW THE SUMMIT 
IS PLAYING OUT IN THE NATION'S 
CAPITAL. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>> THERE YOU HAVE NORTH KOREA. 
IT'S EVENING THERE, AS YOU CAN 
TELL. 
NORTH KOREAN LEADER, KIM JONG-
UN HAS LEFT SINGAPORE. 
HE HAS HEADED HOME, AS IS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON AIR FORCE 
ONE. 
HEADED BACK FROM THIS 
UNBELIEVABLE SUMMIT THAT HAS 
BEEN DESCRIBED AS HISTORIC, 
SURPRISING, AMAZING. 
MANY PEOPLE STUNNED BY THE FACT 
THAT WE HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
IN DECADES, A NORTH KOREAN 
LEADER MEETING WITH THE 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. 
I WANT TO BRING IN FACE THE 
NATION MODERATOR AND CBS NEWS 
SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
CORRESPONDENT, MARGARET BRENNAN 
TO JUST TALK ABOUT THIS. 
MARGARET, WE'RE GETTING 
REACTION FROM SOME OF THE OTHER 
PLAYERS IN THE REGION, THAT 
HAVE BEEN OBSERVING THIS. 
CHINA, JAPAN, RUSSIA, BUT I'M 
GOING TO READ YOU A STATEMENT 
FROM THE JAPANESE PRIME 
MINISTER. 
HE SAID, THIS IS JUST BEING 
RELEASED. 
I WANT TO EXPRESS MY HEARTFELT 
RESPECT FOR THE EFFORTS AND 
LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, 
I SUPPORT THE SUMMIT MEETING 
TODAY THAT HAS RECONFIRMED 
CHAIRMAN KIM JONG-UN'S 
COMMITMENT TO THE COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAEN 
PENINSULA, AS A STEP FORWARD 
TOWARD THE COMPREHENSIVE 
RESOLUTIONS OF OUTSTANDING 
ISSUES OF CONCERN. 
OUTSTANDING, BECAUSE IT'S NOT 
THE FIRST TIME NORTH KOREA HAS 
PROMISED THIS SORT OF THING. 
>>  RIGHT. 
AND REITERATING SOMETHING THEY 
ALREADY PROMISED IN THE PAST TO 
DO AND THEN CHEATED ON THOSE 
PAST AGREEMENTS. 
SO, WHAT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME? 
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT THE 
ENFORCEMENT. 
IT'S GOING TO BE WHAT THE 
SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER, JOHN 
BOLTON, CAN GET THEM TO WORK 
OUT IN TERMS OF DETAILS. 
THEY SAID THERE'S ANOTHER 
MEETING NEXT WEEK. 
WE KNOW THAT THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT TEAM, THERE'S STILL 
A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. 
WHAT YOU GOT TODAY WAS A 
FRAMEWORK. 
A GENERAL ONE. 
A PROMISE OF SECURITY 
GUARANTEES. 
THE PRESIDENT WOULDN'T SAY WHAT 
THEY ARE BEYOND THIS PAUSE. %
IS IT A COMPLETE END? 
A TEMPORARY HALT IN MILITARY 
EXERCISES? 
HE SAID THE TROOPS WILL REMAIN 
NOW, WHAT HAPPENS IN THE 
FUTURE. 
SO, THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL 
HERE THAT HAS TO STILL BE 
NEGOTIATED. 
BUT, TO BE FAIR, IT TOOK TWO 
YEARS TO GET THE AGREEMENT WITH 
IRAN. 
THIS IS A FIRST MEETING. 
THEY'VE HAD ABOUT SEVEN ONE ON 
ONES WITH THESE NORTH KOREAN 
AND U.S. TEAMS OF DIPLOMATS. 
100 DIFFERENT TECHNICAL 
ADVISERS WEIGHING IN. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF NORTH KOREA 
AGREED TO ANY. 
THEY HAVEN'T HANDED OVER THAT 
LIST OF NUCLEAR SITES. 
>>  RIGHT. 
AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE LIST 
THAT THEY WOULD HAND OVER, NOT 
NECESSARILY THE LIST THAT 
INTELLIGENCE WOULD SUGGEST 
SHOULD BE INSPECTED. 
BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK 
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
ONE THING THAT DIDN'T COME UP 
WITH THE PRESS CONFERENCE IS 
THE TIME LINE. 
AND EXPERTS HAVE INDICATED 
THERE COULD BE A COUPLE OF 
YEARS, 15, 20 YEARS. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID IN THAT 
PRESS CONFERENCE, IT WOULD 
HAPPEN QUICKLY, BUT IT WOULD 
TAKE TIME. 
WHEN HE WAS PRESSED ON WHAT 
QUICKLY MEANT, HE DIDN'T GIVE A 
TIME LINE. 
AND SO, MOVING FORWARD, AT 
LEAST THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, 
WHEN WE TRY TO GAUGE THE 
SUCCESS OF THIS SUMMIT, WHAT 
ARE WE LOOKING FOR? 
>>  WELL, THE PRESIDENT WAS 
LOOKING FOR THIS GENERAL 
FRAMEWORK WITH THE DETAILS TO 
BE NEGOTIATED. 
HE GOT THAT. 
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS SEEM TO 
BE LOOKING FOR WAS THIS 
RECOGNITION. 
THEY DIDN'T GET SANCTIONS 
RELIEF HERE UP FRONT. 
THAT IS WHAT THEY REALLY 
WANTED. 
BUT THEY GOT THIS PROMISE OF, 
WELL WE'LL LIFT THEM WHEN YOU 
DELIVER ON DENUCLEARIZATION. 
TWO VERY -- STATEMENTS. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE WITHOUT 
GETTING SOMETHING. 
SO FAR, DOESN'T IT APPEAR THE 
U.S. HAS GOTTEN ANYTHING, OTHER 
THAN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID 
WAS NOT IN THE AGREEMENT, BUT 
HE BELIEVES NORTH KOREA IS 
CARRYING OUT THIS DESTRUCTION 
OF SOME OF THEIR MISSILES. 
YOU CAN BUILD ANOTHER MISSILE. 
SO, THE COMPLETE, IRREVERSIBLE 
VERIFICATION THAT YOU CONTINUE 
TO HEAR THEM REPEAT, WE HAVEN'T 
SEEN EVIDENCE OF. 
IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THEY 
HAVE GOTTEN WHAT THEY BELIEVE 
IS THIS FAR AT A LEVEL WITH THE 
LEADERSHIP THAT THEY HAVE NOT 
GOTTEN IN THE PAST. 
RIGHT? 
SO, THEY BELIEVE IT'S DIFFERENT 
THIS TIME. 
BUT THE PRESIDENT TO GIVE HIM 
HIS CREDIT SAID LOOK, I MAY 
STAND UP HERE SIX MONTHS FROM 
NOW AND TELL YOU HE'S WRONG. 
NOT ONLY TO MEET WITH KIM AGAIN 
POTENTIALLY, BUT SAY DEAL IS 
OFF. 
>>  YOU KNOW, HE INDICATED THE 
COMPONENTS OF THIS AGREEMENT 
THAT THEY SIGNED WERE HAMMERED 
OUT BEFOREHAND, WHICH IS WHAT 
WE WOULD EXPECT. 
MOST OF THEM ANYWAYS. 
WHEN HE WAS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 
OR NOT HE TRUSTED KIM JONG-UN, 
HE REPEATED HE DID. 
HE SAID THE SAME THING ON THE 
FLIGHT BACK HOME. 
WHEN ASKED WHY, HE KIND OF 
DEFERRED BACK TO HIS GUT, HIS 
INSTINCT, IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
OTHER POLITICIANS DON'T DO SO 
WELL. 
BUT I'M PRETTY GOOD AT. 
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THAT? 
THIS IS A GUY THAT, YOU KNOW, 
AS A PRESIDENT, WE KNOW HE 
VALUES THAT ONE ON ONE, FACE TO 
FACE CONNECTION. 
AND HE VALUES READING PEOPLE. 
IS THAT DANGEROUS AT THIS 
LEVEL? 
>>  IT'S A DANGEROUS THING TO 
SAY, BECAUSE IT CAN SO EASILY 
COME BACK TO HURT YOU. 
AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING, 
REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH 
WAS GIVEN SUCH GRIEF FOR 
SAYING, I LOOKED INTO PUTIN'S 
EYES AND I SAW HIS SOUL. 
WE HAVE SEEN WHAT  VLADIMIR 
PUTIN THINKS OF THE UNITED 
STATES, AND WHAT HE DOES IN 
TERMS OF ATTACKS AGAINST THIS 
COUNTRY, WITH THE CYBER HACKING 
AND OTHER THINGS. 
WILL THE PRESIDENT REGRET TO 
SAY, I TRUST KIM JONG-UN? 
NO DOUBT. 
TRUST, BUT VERIFY, THE 
PRESIDENT SAYING WE WILL 
VERIFY, BUT HE HASN'T TOLD US 
EXACTLY HOW YET. 
WE KNOW THE WISH LIST. 
THEY WANT TO GET INSPECTORS ON 
THE GROUND TO ROAM THROUGH 
THESE SITES, ABOUT 100 OF THEM 
TO SEE WHAT'S IN THE ARSENAL. 
WE DID NOT GET THAT TODAY THAT 
WE KNOW ABOUT. 
WE DID NOT GET THAT WE KNOW 
ABOUT, A LIST OF THOSE SUSPECT 
SITES THAT INTELLIGENCE CAN 
COMPARE TO WHAT WE THINK THEY 
ú 
THEY HAVE. 
SO, THAT VERIFYING PART OF IT, 
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO PROVE 
THAT HE IS TRUSTWORTHY UNTIL WE 
GET THERE. 
>>  AND WHAT WE DIDN'T HEAR 
TALK OF ARE SECURITY 
ASSURANCES. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT 
PROMISED KIM JONG-UN IN THE 
PRESS AVAILABILITIES HE HAD. 
>>  AND REPORTERS PRESSED THE 
PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS OFF CAMERA 
ON AIR FORCE ONE. 
AN AUDIO RECORDING WAS SHARED 
WITH RECORDERS. 
HE SAID I DON'T WANT TO TALK 
ABOUT THAT. 
SO, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT 
MEANS. 
WE KNOW IN THE PAST, THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SAID HE SHOULDN'T 
WORRY ABOUT REGIME CHANGE. 
IS THAT ENOUGH OF A SECURITY 
GUARANTEE? 
IS THAT ECONOMIC SECURITY IN 
TERMS OF PROMISE OF AIDE? 
WE KNOW THE U.N. HAS SAID THEY 
WANTED TO DELIVER ABOUT $100 
MILLION. 
THEY ARE TRYING TO RAISE FUNDS 
FOR THAT. 
IF IT COMES FROM THE UNITED 
NATIONS, DOES THAT MAKE IT 
SOMEHOW NOT COUNT AS AMERICAN 
AIDE TO NORTH KOREA? 
THERE IS DIPLOMATIC WIGGLE ROOM 
HERE THAT NEGOTIATORS HAVE 
CARVED OUT FOR THEMSELVES ON A 
FEW FRONTS. 
SANCTIONS, REMEMBER, WE ALWAYS 
THINK IN TERMS OF BILATERAL 
TERMS, THE PRESIDENT LIKES 
THINKING ABOUT WHAT AMERICA, 
NORTH KOREA CAN DO. 
THIS IS A WIN FOR THE GLOBAL, 
SO MANY SUPPORTERS COMPLAIN 
ABOUT, BECAUSE THE REASON NORTH 
KOREA IS ON THE ROPES NOT JUST 
BECAUSE OF THE U.S., BUT 
ADVERSARIES AND ALLIES THAT ARE 
JUST AS WORRIED AS WE WERE AND 
PUT SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA. 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO IN 
TERMS OF, DOES CHINA GO THROUGH 
WITH MORE TRADE WITH NORTH 
KOREA OR RUSSIA? 
YOU CAN SEE SOME WEAKENING OF 
THAT LEVERAGE, SOME LEE WAY FOR 
THEM, EVEN IF THE U.S. DOESN'T 
PULL BACK ON THOSE SANCTIONS. 
>>  AND FINALLY, WHAT WASN'T IN 
THE AGREEMENT, BUT THE 
PRESIDENT DISCUSSED IT, HAD TO 
DO WITH HUMAN RIGHTS 
VIOLATIONS. 
AND EVEN WITHIN THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE, THE PRESIDENT SAID 
IT CAME UP BRIEFLY. 
IT WAS NOT A PRIORITY FOR HIM 
DURING THE SUMMIT. 
>>  WELL, LOOK. 
IN THESE SUMMITS, AND IT'S TRUE 
WITH IRAN. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS 
PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS REALLY 
GIVEN GRIEF ABOUT BY REPORTERS 
BY MYSELF, BY OTHERS WHO SAID 
HOW CAN YOU NEGOTIATE WHEN YOU 
HAVE PRISONERS IN JAIL. 
AMERICANS IN JAIL. 
HOW CAN YOU DO THIS WHEN THEY 
HAVE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES IN 
IRAN. 
WE CAN DISCUSS THIS ONE TOPIC 
BECAUSE IT IS A NATIONAL 
SECURITY ISSUE FOR ALL OF US. 
AMERICA HAS CUT DEALS WITH 
DICTATORS IN THE PAST, WITH 
HORRIBLE HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES 
AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THEM 
AIDE. 
IT'S ONE OF THOSE UNCOMFORTABLE 
COME PROMIZES THAT AMERICA 
CONTINUES TO MAKE. 
IS IT ON THE SCALE OF WHAT WE 
ARE SEEING IN NORTH  NORTH 
KOREA RIGHT NOW? 
THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE IN TERMS 
OF WHERE HE RANKS, VERSUS 
DICTATORS, LIKE BASHAR AL 
ASSAD, OR OTHERS. 
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO ASK ABOUT 
AND THAT DIPLOMATS WILL PRESS. 
WHEN YOU GET INTO THE ROOM, AND 
THE BEGINNINGS OF THESE 
MEETINGS, THEY KIND OF START 
WITH, OKAY, GIVE ME YOUR LIST 
OF COMPLAINTS, GIVE ME YOUR 
LIST OF COMPLAINTS. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE 
HERE TO TALK ABOUT. 
THE MAJORITY OF THE 
CONVERSATION IS ON THE ISSUE AT 
HAND. 
SO, THERE'S AN AIRING OF THE 
GRIEVANCES OFTEN BEFORE YOU GET 
INTO THE DETAILS OF THE 
NEGOTIATIONS. 
>>  AND ULTIMATELY, DO YOU 
THINK THIS IS A WIN FOR KIM 
JONG-UN AT THIS POINT? 
>>  HE CERTAINLY GOT THE WIN TO 
GO -- THE POLITICAL LEE WAY TO 
GO BACK TO HIS PEOPLE AND SAY 
LOOK, LOOK AT SINGAPORE AND ALL 
OF THESE LIGHTS AND ALL OF THE 
ACCESS AND ALL OF THE MONEY 
HERE, MAYBE I CAN BRING SOME OF 
THAT TO NORTH KOREA AND TO YOU 
AND LOOK AT THAT AMERICAN FLAG 
RIGHT NEXT TO THE NORTH KOREAN 
ONE. 
LOOK AT THAT RECOGNITION. 
NO ONE HAS GOTTEN THAT FOR YOU 
BEFORE. 
IF HE WAS WORRIED ABOUT 
POTENTIAL THREATS TO HIS POWER 
FROM WITHIN HIS OWN MILITARY OR 
ELSEWHERE, HE CAN TURN TO HIS 
PEOPLE AND SAY I DID FOR YOU 
WHAT NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE. 
INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION FROM 
THE MOST POWERFUL MAN IN THE 
WORLD. 
FROM THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD, THEY ARE CALLING 
ME A FRIEND. 
>>  THOSE IMAGES ARE PROBABLY 
GETTING A LOT OF PLAY ON NORTH 
KOREAN TELEVISION. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE GOING 
TO HEAD TO NORA, GAYLE, AND 
JOHN, AND THE CBS MORNING TEAM 
WILL GET US CAUGHT UP ON 
STORIES. 
A HOSTAGE SITUATION INVOLVING 
FOUR KIDS TURNED TRAGIC IN 
FLORIDA. 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>> GOOD MORNING. 
IT'S TUESDAY, JUNE 12, 2018. 
WELCOME TO CBS THIS MORNING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND NORTH KOREA 
LEADER KIM JONG-UN WRAP UP 
THEIR HISTORIC MEETING BY 
SIGNING A JOINT DECLARATION. 
THE AGREEMENT CALLING FOR 
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA, BUT 
THERE'S FEW DETAILS. 
WE WILL DISCUSS WHAT IT MEANS

POPULAR SUVs. 
WE WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THE

TRANSPLANT PROGRAM IS SHUT 
DOWN. 
HOW IT REVEALED AN UNUSUAL 
NUMBER OF DEATHS.

THE DRUG MAKER'S PLAN TO HELP 
CANCER PATIENTS AND LOWER THE 
COST OF TREATMENT. 
WE BEGIN WITH YOUR WORLD IN 90 
SECONDS. 
>> ANYONE CAN MAKE WAR, BUT 
ONLY THE MOST COURAGEOUS CAN 
PROMISE PEACE. 
>> KIM JONG-UN PROMISING TO 
GIVE UP HIS NUCLEAR ARSENAL. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THE 
JOINT MILITARY EXERCISES WITH 
THE SOUTH WILL END WITH THIS 
AGREEMENT. 
>> WE HAVE A SPECIAL BOND. 
PEOPLE WILL BE IMPRESSED AND 
VERY HAPPY. 
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
JUST SHERIFFED NEW SANCTIONS ON 
RUSSIAN COMPANIES AND 
EXECUTIVES LINKED TO CYBER 
ATTACKS ON THE U.S. 
>>> FEARS WILL NO LONGER BE 
ACCEPTED AS CONDITIONS FOR 
ACCEPTING ASYLUM. 
>>> FOUR CHILDREN ARE DEAD 
AFTER A DAY-LONG STANDOFF IN 
OHIO. 
THE MAN WHO HELD HIM THERE IS 
DEAD ALSO. 
>>> LARRY KUDLOW SUFFERED A 
HEART ATTACK. 
HE'S EXPECTED TO MAKE A FULL 
RECOVERY. 
>> ALL OF THAT -- PUT ON SHOW 
FOR WATCHING. 
>> AND ALL THAT MALTERS. 
>> THE IMAGES FOR SINGAPORE 
BRINGING DENNIS RODMAN TO 
TEARS. 
>> TODAY IS A GREAT DAY FOR 
EVERYONE, SINGAPORE, TOKYO, 
CHINA, EVERYWHERE. 
IT'S A GREAT DAY. 
>> THAT SUMMIT WAS ON A RESORT 
ISLAND WHERE UNIVERSAL 
SINGAPORE IS LOCATED RIGHT 
ACROSS THE STREET. 
>> THE NEGOTIATIONS ARE CLOSED 
TO THE PRESS, BUT THEY HAVE 
RELEASED THIS PICTURE, OKAY. 
THEY ARE HAVING A GOOD TIME. 
WE ARE ON THE BRINK OF WORLD 
WAR WEEEEEEEEE! 
>>> HISTORY IN THE MAKING, AND 
IT HAPPENED WHILE MANY PEOPLE 
WERE SLEEPING. 
>> NOT US. 
>> WELCOME TO CBS THIS MORNING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG-UN 
FINISHING AN UNPRECEDENTED 
MEETING IN SINGAPORE WITH THE 
DEAL TO START DENUCLEARIZING 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
>> WE ARE VERY PROUD OF WHAT 
TOOK PLACE TODAY. 
I THINK OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP 
WITH NORTH KOREA AND THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA WILL BE A VERY MUCH 
DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN IT HAS 
BEEN IN THE PAST. 
>> THE TWO LEADERS SIGNED WHAT 
MR. TRUMP CALLED A 
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENT, 
DETAILING WHAT HE SAID WAS A 
COMMIT. 
TO THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. 
>> IT OFFERS FEW SPECIFICS ON 
HOW THE NUCLEAR ARSENAL WILL BE 
REMOVED. 
THE SUMMIT, WHICH LASTED LESS 
THAN 5 HOURS WAS THE FIRST WITH 
A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT AND A 
NORTH KOREA LEADER. 
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IT 
WOULD LEAD TO MANY MORE 
MEETINGS AND WILL ABSOLUTELY 
ONSIDER INVITING KIM TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
JEFF GLOR IS LEADING OUR 
COVERAGE FROM SINGAPORE, WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT LEFT A SHORT TIME 
AGO. 
GOOD MORNING. 
WHAT A DAY. 
>> Reporter: IN DEED, GOOD 
MORNING, GAYLE, GOOD MORNING TO 
YOU, GOOD EVENING HERE FROM 
SINGAPORE. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE DID 
EVERYTHING HING -- HE COULD AT 
THE SUMMIT, AND THAT'S WHY HE 
IS HEADED BACK EARLIER. 
THEY AGREED TO DENUCLEARIZATION 
BUT THEY DID NOT ESTABLISH A 
TIMETABLE FOR THE GOAL. 
COULD BE 3-15 YEARS FOLKS SAY 
FOR DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE 
PENINSULA IF IT HAPPENS, AND 
THERE WAS ALSO NO MENTION IN 
THE AGREEMENT OF HUMANS RIGHTS 
ABUSES COMMITTED BY THE REGIME, 
AND HOW THE DEAL WOULD GET DONE 
THAT SAID, THERE'S A SIGNED 
DOCUMENTS, AND IT WAS THE FIRST 
TIME A SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT 
HAS MET WITH THE LEADER OF 
NORTH KOREA, AND THERE WERE 
THESE HANDSHAKES. 
MAJOR GARRETT IS AT THE SITE OF 
THE HISTORIC SUMMIT WITH MORE 
ON THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN MOVING 
FORWARD. 
MAJOR, GOOD MORNING. 
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. 
IMAGES FOR THIS HOTEL WERE IN 
EVERY WAY HISTORIC. 
NORTH KOREA HAS A CHECKERED 
HISTORY OF LIVING UP TO THE 
AGREEMENTS MADE WITH THE UNITED 
STATES. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THERE'S A 
REAL CHANCE FOR PEACE, 
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND A BRAND 
NEW RELATIONSHIP, WHY? 
THE PRESIDENT NOW TRUSTS KIM 
JONG-UN, AND HE KNOWS HE WANTS 
TO MAKE A DEAL. 
MORE SUMMITS APPEAR INEVITABLE, 
AND THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS 
OPEN TO TRAVELING TO THE 
CAPITAL IN NORTH KOREA, AND HE 
WILL INVITE KIM TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
>> THE LETTER IS VERY 
COMPREHENSIVE. 
>> Reporter: A JOINT STATEMENT 
SEEKING A NEW RELATIONSHIP, A 
PROCESS TO BRING PEACE TO THE 
TWO KOREANS, AND FOR THE NORTH 
TO WORK TOWARDS COMPLETE 
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN 
PENINSULA. 
>> IT DOES NOT TALK ABOUT 
VERIFIABLE OR IRREVERSIBLE, IS 
THAT A CONCESSION? 
>> NO, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT 
SAYS IT WILL BE GONE. 
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE ANY 
MORE PLAIN THAN WHAT WE ARE 
ASKING. 
>> Reporter: WE ASKED ABOUT 
VERIFYING NORTH KOREAN 
COMPLIANCE. 
>> IT WILL BE ACHIEVED BY 
HAVING CERTAIN PEOPLE THERE. 
>> Reporter: WILL THE PEOPLE BE 
AMERICANS OR INTERNATIONAL. 
>> COMBINATION OF BOTH. 
WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT, YES. 
>> Reporter: THE DAY BEGAN WITH 
NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN IMAGES WITH A 
SITTING U.S. PRESIDENT SHAKING 
HANDS WITH THE LEADER OF THE 
REGIME. 
KIM JONG-UN SAID IT WAS LIKE A 
SCENE FROM A SCIENCE FICTION 
MOVIE. 
LAST YEAR'S CHEST THUMPING AND 
INSULTS BETWEEN THE TWO WERE A 
DISTANT MEMORY, REPLACED BY 
CHATTING AS THEY WALKED IN ONE 
OF SINGAPORE'S MOST LUXURIOUS 
HOTELS. 
SEATED ALONE WITH INTERPRETERS 
ONLY, KIM SAID THEY OVERCAME 
THE OBSTACLES OF THE PAST, AND 
LATER IN A MEETING INCLUDING 
THE LEADERS' AIDES, PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAID HE WAS CONFIDENT THE 
TWO WOULD MAKE PROGRESS. 
>> I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. 
IT WILL BE DONE. 
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT SAID 
NORTH KOREA HAS A SIZABLE 
ARSENAL, AND KIM KNOWS AS MUCH 
OR MORE ABOUT THE MILITARY THAT 
SUPERVISES IT, AND NORTH KOREA 
HAS TAKEN NO AGGRESSIVE STEPS 
TO DISMANTLE, BUT HE SAID NOW 
IS THE TIME TO END JOINT 
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH THE 
U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY ARE 
EXPENSIVE, AND IN THIS 
ATMOSPHERE OF GOOD WILL HE SAID 
THEY ARE, QUOTE, INAPPROPRIATE. 
>> Reporter: MAJOR, WHAT THE 
PRESIDENT CALLED WAR GAMES, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID IN THE 
PAST, TAKING NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
OUT OF NORTH KOREA COULD HAPPEN 
VERY QUICKLY, AND THIS MORNING 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED IT COULD TAKE A 
LONG TIME. 
BEN TRACEY IS HERE NOW, ALSO IN 
SINGAPORE, LOOKING AT HOW  -- 
BEN TRACY IS HERE NOW ALSO IN 
SINGAPORE, LOOKING AT THE 
PROCESS. 
>> Reporter: THE FIRST STEP 
WOULD BE FINDING OUT WHAT THEY 
HAVE, AND WHERE THEY HAVE IT. 
IT'S BELIEVED NORTH KOREA HAS 
MATERIAL FOR UP TO 30 NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, 100 SITES THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY THAT INSPECTORS 
WANT TO ACCESS, INCLUDING THE 
SPRAWLING COMPLEX ABOUT 50 
MILES FROM THE CAPITAL. 
IT COVERS NEARLY 3 SQUARE MILES 
WITH HUNDREDS OF BUILDINGS. 
>> THE NUMBER ONE THING THE 
U.S. OFFICIALS WOULD WANT IS TO 
INSPECT THE WARHEAD. 
>> Reporter: MELISSA IS AN 
EXPERT AND SAYS THE WARHEADS 
WILL REVEAL VALUABLE 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE DESIGN 
AND ADVANCE. 
OF THE PROGRAM. 
THE U.S. WANTS ALL PARTS 
DESTROYED, SHIPPED TO A LAB IN 
TENNESSEE. 
IT COULD TAKE UP TO 10 YEARS. 
>> AND THEN YOU TO SEARCH THE 
REST OF NORTH KOREA TO MAKE 
SURE THERE WAS NOTHING THEY DID 
NOT DECLARE. 
>> Reporter: LAST MONTH NORTH 
KOREA, CLAIMING TO HAVE 
DESTROYED THE MAIN NUCLEAR 
TESTING SITE, BUILT DEEP IN A 
REMOTE COMPLEX. 
>> Reporter: IS THE ENTRANCE TO 
THE NORTH KOREA TEST SITE, 
WHERE THEY HAVE CONDUCTED FIVE 
OF THE SIX NUCLEAR TESTS OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. 
WE WERE PART OF THE SMALL GROUP 
OF JOURNALISTS ALLOWED TO 
WITNESS WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS 
SAID WAS A SHOW OF GOOD FAITH. 
>> THEE ARE ALL JOURNALISTS, NO 
OUTSIDE EXPERTS VERIFYING WHAT 
THEY HAVE DONE HERE HAS MADE 
THE SITE UNUSABLE. 
>> Reporter: VERIFICATION BY 
TRAINED EXPERCENTS WILL BE 
CRUCIAL, AND INSPECTIONS WILL 
BE NEEDED FOR DECADES TO MAKE 
SURE NORTH KOREA DOES NOT 
CHEAT. 
>> WITH NORTH KOREA, YOU'RE 
NEVER 100% SURE. 
>> Reporter: THEY WOULD STILL 
HAVE PLENTY OF MISSILES AND 
AMMUNITION THAT COULD DEVASTATE 
JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA AND THEIR 
STOCKPILES OF CHEMICAL AND 
BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS. 
>> TRUMP-KIM PART ONE HAS LEFT 
TOWN, AND WE ARE WAITING TO SEE 
WHAT THE SEQUEL IS. 
MUCH MORE COVERAGE FROM 
SINGAPORE IN THE NEXT HOUR. 
FOR NOW, BACK TO JOHN IN NEW 
YORK. 
>> THANK YOU, JEFF. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HIS  
MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN WOULD 
NOT HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THE 
DEATH OF OTTO WARMBIER. 
THE STUDENT FROM OHIO WAS 
RELEASED A YEAR AGO TOMORROW. 
HE WAS DETAINED FOR 17 MONTHS 
OVER AN ALLEGED THEFT. 
>> I REALLY THINK THAT OTTO IS 
SOMEONE WHO DID NOT DIE IN 
VAIN. 
I TOLD THIS TO HIS PARENTS, A 
SPECIAL YOUNG MAN, AND I HAVE 
TO SAY SPECIAL PARENTS, SPECIAL 
PEOPLE. 
OTTO DID NOT DIE IN VAIN. 
HE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH US 
BEING HERE TODAY. 
>> THE PRESIDENT HELPED TO 
SECURE OTTO WARMBIER'S RELEASE. 
HE DIED A WEEK LATER AFTER 
BEING IN A COMA. 
>>> THE FIRST GLOBAL REACTIONS 
COMING FROM THE PRESIDENT OF 
SOUTH KOREA. 
HE SAID HIS COUNTRY WILL, 
QUOTE, WRITE A NEW HISTORY OF 
PEACE WITH NORTH KOREA. 
OTHER PEOPLE IN SOUTH KOREA 
GATHERED TO WATCH IN PUBLIC 
SPACES LIKE THE TRAIN STATIONS, 
AND CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTER 
SAID THEY ARE CREATING A NEW 
HISTORY, AND HIS SPOKESPERSON 
ú 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
-- KOREA. 
>>> MARGARET BRENNAN IS HERE 
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
EURASIA GROUP. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE DID NOT 
GIVE UP ANYTHING. 
SOUTH KOREA RESPONDED SAYING WE 
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT 
HE MEANT.  
IS THIS A BIG CONCESSION? 
>> IT'S TREMENDOUS. 
SOUTH KOREA IS OUR PARTNERS, 
THE ALLIES IN THE EXERCISES, 
AND THE PENTAGON HAS NOT SAID 
IS IT A HALT, SUSPENSION, HOW 
LONG DOES IT LAST? 
THERE'S SO MANY DETAILS WE 
DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THE 
SECURITY GUARANTEE THAT IS 
MENTIONED HERE IN THE 
STATEMENT. 
DOES IT GO BEYOND THAT? 
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN ASKED BY 
REPORTERS THREE TIMES, WHAT 
ELSE DID YOU PROMISE FOR 
SECURITY GUARANTEES, AND HE 
WILL NOT GO INTO IT. 
IT'S UP TO MIKE POMPEO WHO IS 
FLYING TO CHINA AND SOUTH KOREA 
TO EXPLAIN AND WORK OUT THE 
DETAILS. 
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE 
AGREEMENTS IN THE PAST, 1994, 
2005, 2012, AND THE NORTH 
KOREANS HAVE A GREAT STRATEGY, 
STRINGING US ALONG, RINGING OUT 
NEW ECONOMIC STUFF, AND THEN 
IT'S JUST TALK, AND THEY 
CONTINUE THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
PROGRAM. 
WHY SHOULD WE BELIEVE THEM NOW? 
>> WE SHOULD NOT BELIEVE THEM. 
IT'S SURPRISING TO HEAR TRUMP 
SAY I TRUST THE GUY. 
IT'S A STRONGER FORMULATION 
THAN BUSH LOOKING INTO PUTIN'S 
EYES AND SAYING I SAW HIS SOUL, 
BUT KIM JONG-UN IS FOCUSING ON 
THE ECONOMIC ENGAGEMENT, AND 
THE OPENNESS WITH SOUTH KOREA 
WITH A SUMMIT TWICE NOW, AND 
ONCE WITH RUSSIA, AND NOW 
TRUMP, AND THAT IS THE STORY, 
AND NORTH KOREA IS OPENING UP, 
AND TRUMP IS A PIECE OF IT. 
LET'S KEEP IN MIND. 
WE HAVE A FREEZE FOR FREEZE. 
NORTH KOREA IS FREEZING THEIR 
ICBM AND NUCLEAR TESTS, AND THE 
AMERICANS ARE FREEZING OUR 
MILITARY EXERCISE WITH THE 
SOUTH KOREANS. 
THAT'S WHAT THEY HAVE ASKED 
FOR, AND WE SAID ABSOLUTELY 
NOT. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT 
DENUCLEARIZATION. 
IN THE AGREEMENT, IT'S A 
REAFFIRMATION OF POINT NUMBER 
THREE, THE PREVIOUS PROMISE THE 
NORTH KOREANS MADE, TO WORK 
TOWARDS THE CRUCIAL -- WORK 
WORKING TOWARDS, AS OPPOSED TO 
AGREEING TO. 
WHAT WAS AGREED TO HERE THAT 
NORTH KOREANS HAVE NOT 
PREVIOUSLY AGREED TO ON NUCS. 
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DON'T 
KNOW. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY ARE 
STARTING TO BREAK APART OF 
THEIR MISSILES, PART OF THE 
IRREVERSIBLE STEP HE WANTED TO 
SEE. 
MIKE POMPEO IS FLYING TO 
EXPLAIN TO THE NATIONS WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE ROOM, BUT HE 
HAS TO BRIEF CONGRESS. 
ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS F 
YOU TAKE A  -- IF YOU TAKE A 
STEP BACK, IT TOOK 2 YEARS FOR 
IRAN TO HALT THEIR PROGRAM, AND 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY LEVELS 
LIKE NORTH KOREA. 
MIKE POMPEO SET HOLY HELL OVER 
THAT DEAL. 
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT AMERICA 
WANTS, BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF 
THAT'S WHAT WAS AGREED TO IN 
THE ROOM. 
WE KNOW THAT'S WHAT JOHN BOLTON 
SAID, HE WANTS AMERICAN 
INSPECTORS TO TAKE THE LEAD TO 
BREAK APART THE WEAPONS SO THEY 
DON'T CHEAT LIKE IN THE PAST. 
>> WHAT STOOD OUT TO BOTH OF 
YOU IN THE AGREEMENT WE HAVE 
REACHED TODAY? 
IS THERE A WIN FOR BOTH SIDES? 
>> I THINK WHAT THE BIGGEST WIN 
IS THAT 6 MONTHS AGO, WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY 
OF MILITARY PREEMPTION AGAINST 
NORTH KOREA. 
IT'S ALMOST INCONCEIVABLE 
THERE'S A SHORT-TERM RISK OF 
CONFLICT. 
THAT'S A WIN FOR THE PEOPLE OF 
NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA, 
FIRST OF ALL. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT THE CHINESE 
TO SQUEEZE HARDER ON SANCTIONS, 
AND NORTH KOREANS CAME TO THE 
TABLE. 
BEFORE THAT, THE ONLY FOREIGNER 
KIM JONG-UN HAD MET WITH WAS 
DENNIS RODMAN. 
AS MARGARET SUGGESTED, IT'S 
HARD TO GO FROM HERE TO 
DENUCLEARIZATION, AND NORTH 
KOREANS DIDN'T TAKE ANY 
CONCRETE STEP TOWARDS THAT 
YESTERDAY. 
>> ONE THING THE PRESIDENT 
DANGLED WAS THE REMOVING OF 
30,000 TROOPS WHO HAVE BEEN IN 
THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
I LIVED THERE AS A KID. 
IT'S A LONG-TIME COMMITMENT TO 
THE AREA IT DOES NOT JUST 
AFFECT THE KOREAN PENINSULA, IT 
AFFECTS THE MILITARY POSTURE IN 
ASIA. 
ISN'T THAT WHAT CHINA WANTS? 
>> NOT ONLY WHAT IAN 
HIGHLIGHTED THERE, THIS IS WHAT 
CHINA WANTS. 
NORTH KOREA IS NOT THE ONLY 
FLASH POINT IN ASIA, AS YOU 
POINT OUT. 
-- CLASH POINT IN ASIA, AS YOU 
POINT OUT. 
AND SOUTH KOREA WAS LOOKING FOR 
AN OFFRAMP, CONCERNED OVER THE 
MILITARY TENSIONS, AND HE 
DELIVERED, PULLING OFF THE COUP 
OF GETTING THE OFFICERS INTO 
THE OVAL OFFICERS TO BRIEF THE 
PRESIDENT. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID I HAVE HAD A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM JONG-UN 
FOR 90 DAYS. 
HE HAS NOT SAID IF HE SPOKE TO 
HIM BEFORE. 
>> YOU THINK THEY TALKED ON THE 
PHONE? 
>> THAT SEEMS WHAT HE MAY BE 
DANCING AROUND THERE. 
A RELATIONSHIP FOR 90 DAYS. 
THAT'S WHEN HE SAID I TRUST 
HIM. 
>> WHAT ABOUT THE PERSONAL 
CHEMISTRY WITH THE TWO THEY 
BOTH SEEMED TO ENJOY THE PHOTO 
OP, THE WAY THEY TOUCHED EACH 
OTHER, SMILED AT EACH OTHER, 
GOING FROM PERSONAL NAME 
CALLING NOT SO LONG AGO. 
>> YOU REMEMBER THE WAY THE 
NORTH KOREAN LEADER, HIS FATHER 
WAS PORTRAYED FROM TEAM 
AMERICA, I'M SO LONELY. 
TRUMP AND KIM ARE LEADERS WHO 
CLEARLY REALLY WANT MORE. 
THE WAY SYRIA DEFINED THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION, THAT'S WHAT WE 
ARE SEEING HERE, CHINA IS THE 
BIG WINNER. 
>> THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH IN 
NEXT HOUR WE WILL TALK TO 
LINDSEY GRAHAM ABOUT THE SUMMIT 
AND HOW THE PRESIDENT CAN GET 
NORTH KOREA TO FOLLOW THROUGH. 
>>> WE HAVE MUCH MORE NEWS 
AHEAD THIS MORNING, INCLUDING 
TWO POPULAR SUVs THAT DID NOT 
SCORE WELL ON THE NEWEST CRASH 
TESTS. 
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO KNOW 
AHEAD. 
WHY THE INSURANCE INSTITUTION 
FOR HIGHWAY SAFETY SAYS YOU MAY 
WANT TO THINK TWICE ABOUT THE 
FORD EXPLORER AND JEEP GRAND 
CHEROKEE. 
>>> THE SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE WAS 
KICKED OFF WITH THIS HISTORIC 
MOMENT, THE FIRST TIME A U.S. 
PRESIDENT HAS EVER MET, IN 
PERSON, WITH A NORTH KOREAN 
DICTATOR. 
THE FLAGS WERE SIDE-BY-SIDE, 
HAPPENING JUST AFTER 9:00 
EASTERN STANDARD TIME LAST 
NIGHT, BEFORE THEY SAT DOWN FOR 
EXTENSIVE TALKS, AND YOU KNOW, 
AS WE TALKED SO MUCH ABOUT 
NORTH KOREA AND THE HERMIT 
KINGDOM IN THE PAST, ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED LAST 
NIGHT, WE HEARD FOR THE FIRST 
TIME THE VOICE OF KIM JONG-UN. 
LISTEN. 
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY 
SOMETHING? 
>> NOW, IT'S BEEN 30 YEARS 
SINCE I LIVED IN KOREA, SO I 
CAN'T TRANSLATE. 
HE IS YOUNG WITH A DEEP VOICE. 
HE SMOKES A LOT OF CIGARETTES. 
>> HE SAID IT TOOK AWHILE TO 
GET HERE, AND I HAPPENED TO SEE 
DENNIS RODMAN LAST NIGHT, AND 
HE'S PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE ON 
THE PLANET WHO KNOWS BOTH OF 
THEM, AND WHEN HE WAS ASKED 
DOES HE SPEAK ENGLISH HE SAID 
WELL, AND HE DIDN'T ASK IT 
OUTRIGHT, AND HE SAID WHEN IT 
COMES TO BASKETBALL, HE CAN 
SPEAK ENGLISH. 
>> HE'S A FAN OF AMERICAN POP 
CULTURE. 
>> CERTAINLY BASKETBALL. 
HE WOULD NOT SAY IF HE SPEAKS 
ENGLISH OR NOT. 
>> THAT IMAGE IS AMAZING. 
IT'S QUITE THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP TO HAVE THE 
MEETING TAKE PLACE AFTER ALL 
THE THREATS AND DISCUSSIONS, 
BUT IT'S A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT FOR 
KIM JONG-UN. 
THE HANDSHAKE WHERE THEY LOOK 
LIKE THE LEADERS OF BIG 
POWERFUL COUNTRIES. 
NORTH KOREA HAS NUCLEAR 
WEAPONS, BUT IT'S A COUNTRY IN 
GREAT PEARL ECONOMICALLY. 
MOST COUNTRIES OF THE WEST 
THINK NORTH KOREA IS RUN BY A 
DICTATOR WHO HAS IMPRISONED HIS 
OWN PEOPLE, A HUMAN RIGHTS 
ABUSER, AND THE PICTURES OF THE 
AMERICAN FLAG NEXT TO THE NORTH 
KOREAN FLAG IS QUITE A STRIKING 
VICTORY FOR KIM JONG-UN. 
>> 100,000 PEOPLE ARE IN 
PRISONS, TORTURING THEM, ONE OF 
THE MOST ATROCIOUS HUMAN RIGHTS 
REPORTS IN THE WORLD. 
>> IAN BREMER SAID IT DIDN'T 
START AS A MEETING OF EQUALS, 
BUT IT ENDED THAT WAY WHEN YOU 
SEE THE FLAGS SIDE-BY-SIDE AND 
THE TWO STANDING TOGETHER. 
>>> WELCOME BACK. 
HERE'S THREE THINGS YOU SHOULD 
KNOW THIS MORNING. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS NORTH 
KOREA WILL RETURN THE REMAINS 
OF U.S. PRISONERS OF WAR AND 
THOSE MISSING IN ACTION DURING 
THE KOREAN WAR. 
THE JOINT STATEMENT WAS SIGNED 
THIS MORNING, COMMITTING THE 
NORTH TO THE RECOVERY OF THE 
REMAINS. 
THOUSANDS OF U.S. TROOPS FOR 
THE KOREAN WAR ARE UNACCOUNTED 
FOR 65 YEARS LATER. 
>>> A FEDERAL JUDGE COULD 
DECIDE TODAY IF AT&T CAN TAKE 
OVER TIME WARNER. 
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS 
SUING TO BLOCK THE DEAL, 
ARGUING IT WILL HURT 
COMPETITION. 
REGULATORS SAY IT WILL GIVE 
AT&T UNLAWFUL POWER TO RESTRICT 
ACCESS TO CABLE CHANNELS, 
INCREASING COSTS FOR CONSUMERS. 
AT&T SAYS IT WILL IMPROVE 
COMPETITION WITH STREAMING 
SERVICES AND BENEFIT CONSUMERS. 
THE LANDMARK TRIAL COULD 
INFLUENCE THE FUTURE MEDIA 
MERGERS. 
>>> GEORGE H.W. 
BUSH IS THE FIRST U.S. 
PRESIDENT TO CELEBRATE HIS 94th 
BIRTHDAY TODAY. 
HE'S AT HOME WITH FAMILY AND 
FRIENDS IN MAINE AFTER A RECENT 
HOSPITAL STAY TO TREAT HIS LOW 
BLOOD PRESSURE. 
HE SAID HE WANTS A LOW-KEY DAY 
AND NO PRESENTS. 
HIS FORMER FIRST LADY, BARBARA 
BUSH WOULD HAVE TURNED 93 LAST 
FRIDAY. 
WE WISH THE PRESIDENT A VERY 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
HE USED TO CELEBRATE THEM BY 
JUMPING OUT OF AIRPLANES. 
>> I REMEMBER THAT. 
>> NOW HE WILL PROBABLY JUST 
SPORT FUN SOCKS BECAUSE THAT'S 
WHAT HE LIKES TO DO. 
>> EXACTLY. 
>>> NEW THIS MORNING, CRASH 
TESTS ON TWO POPULAR SUVs ARE 
REVEALING SAFETY CONCERNS. 
THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE FOR 
HIGHWAY SAFETY GAVE THE TO 18 
FORD EXPLORER AND JEEP GRAND 
CHEROKEE POOR RATINGS IN FRONT 
PASSENGER CRASH TESTS. 
THE TESTS SHOWED PROTECTIONS 
BUILT INTO THE DRIVER SIDE 
AREN'T NECESSARILY THERE FOR 
FRONT SEAT PASSENGERS, AND THE 
AGENCY TESTED EIGHT SUVs, AND 
ONLY THREE OF THEM EARNED THE 
TOP SCORE OF GOOD. 
THREE OTHERS WERE RATED 
ACCEPTABLE. 
KRIS VAN CLEAVE IS IN 
WASHINGTON WITH THE EYE OPENING 
RESULTS. 
>> Reporter: GOOD MORNING. 
THE CRASH TEST FOCUSES ON WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN ONE PART OF THE 
FRONT END HITS SOMETHING AT 40 
MILES AN HOUR. 
THE INSURANCE INSTITUTE 
ESTIMATES 25% OF THE SERIOUS 
INJURIES AND DEATHS THAT RESULT 
FROM FRONT END CRASHES COME OUT 
OF THESE KIND OF ACCIDENTS. 
>> Reporter: THE 2018 FORD 
EXPLORER RATED POOR BECAUSE ITS 
STRUCTURE COLLAPSED, INTRUDING 
AS MUCH AS 15 INCHES INTO THE 
SUV, RESULTING IN A HIGH 
LIKELIHOOD OF INJURIES TO THE 
PASSENGER'S HIP AND LOWER LEG. 
FORD INSISTS IT'S SAFE SAYING 
WE CONTINUALLY MAKE 
IMPROVEMENTS TO HELP OUR 
CUSTOMERS STAY SAFE ON THE 
ROAD. 
DAVID ZUBEY IS THE CHIEF 
RESEARCH OFFICER. 
>> WE ARE OBSERVING THE DESIGN 
CHANGES THAT ALL  -- THAT AUTO 
MAKERS WERE MAKING CHANGES BUT 
NOT NECESSARILY TO THE 
PASSENGER VEHICLE. 
>> Reporter: WATCH THE CRASH 
DUMMY'S HEAD WHEN THE JEEP 
CHEROKEE CRASHES IT HITS 
THROUGH THE AIR BAG, AND THE 
SIDE AIR BAG DOES NOT DEPLOY, 
AND THE DOOR OPENS, ALLOWING 
THE DUMMY'S HEAD TO GO OUTSIDE 
OF THE SUV. 
IT RESULTED IN POSSIBLE HEAD 
INJURIES. 
THE SAFETY CAGE INTRUDED INTO 
THE CABIN BY UP TO 10 INCHES. 
FIAT CHRYSLER MAKES THE JEEP 
AND SAYS ALL VEHICLES ARE 
ENGINEERED TO ADDRESS REAL-
WORLD DRIVING SITUATIONS, AND 
NO SINGLE TEST MEASURES OVERALL 
VEHICLE SAFETY. 
>> MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE SHOPPING 
FOR A NEW VEHICLE IS THAT THEY 
HAVE GOT BETTER CHOICES. 
>> Reporter: THE 2019 KIA 
SORENTO DID GOOD AFTER IT WAS 
REDESIGNED TO BETTER PROTECT 
FRONT PASSENGERS, THE ONLY ONE 
OF THE EIGHT TO EARN THE 
HIGHEST OVERALL RATING, TOP 
SAFETY PICK PLUS. 
BOTH THE FORD EXPLORER AND JEEP 
GRAND CHEROKEE ARE OLDER 
DESIGNS. 
FORD EXPECTS THE NEW 2020 FORD 
EXPLORER TO DO BETTER IN THE 
TEST WHEN IT'S LAUNCHED NEXT 
YEAR, AND IT'S EXPECTED THE NEW 
JEEP CHEROKEE WILL ALSO DO 
BETTER WHEN THE VEHICLE 
LAUNCHES. 
>> IMPORTANT INFORMATION, 
CHRIS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> HEART TRANSPLANT DEATHS 
LEADING TO AN INVESTIGATION AT 
A HOUSTON HOSPITAL THAT HELPED 
TO PIONEER THE PROCEDURE. 
AHEAD WHAT PATIENTS' FAMILIES 
AND DOCTORS SAID HAS GONE 
WRONG.
