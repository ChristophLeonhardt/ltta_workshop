President Putin has ordered the start of the withdrawal of Russian forces from Syria and Arty's Daniel Hawkins joins me with this to do with it in here I didn't get my teeth in there down in the studio with the details why they're done so does that mean that Russia's mission in Syria is over well according to some that will be the case in terms of the military phase certainly this was announced by President Putin as you mentioned of a surprise visit to Romania air base in attackee it's part of his middle-eastern visit where he will also meet the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-sisi after leaving Syria as well as you mentioned he's officially given the order for Russian troops to withdraw from the country although the Russian air base in Latakia as well as the naval base of course will remain he has made it clear though that if terrorists according to his words rear their heads again Russia won't hesitate to strike them down once again now since 2015 of course the launch of Russia's air campaign the Syrian army's regained vast amounts of territory as much as 90 percent of the country the Russian warplanes who were involved in the operation the Russian troops have destroyed thousands of targets command posts oil infrastructure training camps etc and participated in some of the key military operations of the war the liberation of Aleppo of Palmyra twice and of datas or as well in addition of course to helping fight jihadist Russian troops on the ground have been actively engaged in demining those areas most affected by the conflict as well the active phase of fighting the most battle-hardened jihadists according to the Russian government is over and now the switch goes over to the political process as well we can have a look now at some of the key moments that the Russian troops have been involved in since 2015 the so-called Islamic state of Syria and Iraq is a state no more for all intents and purposes says the Russian Defense Ministry it has been destroyed as a faction there are still hot spots and isolated pockets Vladimir Putin added but with the liberation of the west bank of the Euphrates River Isis has done 799 days after Russia got involved in Temba 2015 when Isis was arguably at its peak when the Russian operation began Isis held more territory in Syria than any other faction two years and a few months on the Caliphate has been reduced to clumps of villages and uninhabited desert wasn't the Russian Air Force alone that did this the us-led coalition also played a huge part we've been covering the Syrian civil war in depth before Isis even had its name the four jihadists hijacked the rebels cause here are some of the more memorable moments filmed by my colleagues and I this is the air base in Latakia from which Russian jets are launching their sorties against Islamic state targets here in Syria the pilots are ready to go at a moment's notice in this amphitheater laid down by the Romans almost 2,000 years ago that Isis staged one of its sickest massacres the Russian military considers it the crowning jewel of their operation here in Syria you can see here just some of the impressive military hardware that Isis have in their possession that has made the battle for Palmyra so tough we're extremely close to Isis positions less than two kilometres away where is a Syrian artillery position overlooking the industrial quarter of their resort the battle is said to be fierce Isis fired back as we filmed shells began falling all around we ran but the Syrian batteries kept firing life in the azure is still far from normal but at least they won't be starving to death anymore ultimately it wasn't Russian who are American jets that played the decisive role in this this victory belongs to the Syrians a thousands and thousands who fought and died to defeat Isis those who stood up to jihadists even when it seemed nothing could stop them unfortunately it's unlikely that this will end here many isis fighters have escaped oh god on the ground there sleeper cells will terrorize the world for years to come but now they'll no longer have their Caliphate to fight for or to discuss all these issues in more depth we're now joined by America director of nasus a British think-tank that focuses on crises in Syria and the Middle East thank you very much you did a mouth for joining us I mean what do you make of this unexpected trip to Syria well it's quite he was quite surprising we knew all along that the President Putin would be visiting Turkey and and an Egypt later on but then you know would he stop it maybe I don't think anybody thought about this especially there is nothing new but but this is very highly significant because it gives you the impression that there is a you know a large feel or a growing confidence in Syria instability of Syria and so on but this is definitely a surprising visit and it tells you again you know that things are going forward major combating operations regarding the announcement itself of course of withdrawal of major combat units that you know major operations are now coming to an end and things are heading hopefully in the right direction and Ahmad Daniel Hawkins here in the studio along side Kate here this has been labeled the end of this sort of active military phase here in the beginning of what's going to be a long and probably quite complex political process for the country how significant exactly is that transition into that political negotiation phase now well it's going to take it's going to take a long time it will be very hard to convince all stakeholders especially who are those who are influenced heavily by states who do not really want stability in Syria to take part or actually to take active part or proactive part a constructive part so to speak in in building a new Syria so to speak I think the contrast itself or the stark contrast between the Russia Russian announcement of withdrawing major combat units or Russian forces main combat units and the American declaration after declaration of increasing the air forces in Syria and putting them indefinitely unvoyage an invited by the way and tells you that Russia has invested heavily predominantly to secure legitimacy in Syria to support the state and stability basically once the Americans have always will always continue soon apparently to undermine the state and undermine stability in Syria so make no mistake this is not going to happen very soon and there will be parties who will be swayed by America's brand name you know if we stick with the Americans and and don't join with the central government then probably we would be better but you know at the end of the day it's very not unsustainable and hopefully you know we will get this nightmare behind our backs very soon and on that basis then Emma I mean there is you're looking at the consensus of agreement that ISIL is defeated or there are only pockets of resistance remaining do you think that other foreign countries involved in this Syria conflict will follow the Russian example and announced their withdrawal roles as well well as I said the the Americans are not going to do so they've in fact announced that they are beefing up their forces they apparently would want to keep a certain I wouldn't say include because it's actually a large segment of Syria that is now controlled by Syrian democratic forces as independent as possible so that they think they could influence it is what they think they could influence the political process in a sense as a pressure card but that would only lead to instability there is always there is also the ink llave in a blip where the Syrian army has just started major operations in North Hama western Aleppo and Idlib itself where al Qaeda or jabhat al-nusra are basically still there and it will take also time to clear them and reinstate that piece of land into into Syria so we're not you know it's it will take time but certain players have different agendas and different objectives and the Americans they feel that if they hold enough pressure cards like in northeastern Syria and in southern Syria they could probably influence the political process and have their voices heard and you know we're going to suffer a little bit due to that but hopefully things will come right at the end just looking back at the last two years since 2015 my rush has obviously faced some negative reaction a lot of criticism as well for its operation in Syria that's not something we can we can get away from the main achievement without a doubt has been by the Syrian army of course in liberating the country but just from a tactical point of view how significant was Russia's involvement militarily in backing up the Syrian army on the ground well first of all everybody needs to know that the Russian involvement has been highly appreciated by a lot of people who did not really want neither this revolution or you know the the huge support that it got from regional powers you know 120 hundred and thirty countries they wanted to maintain their government they didn't want Syria to go to shreds just like what happened in Iraq or Libya or now as we can see Yemen and I think Russia helped a lot with that and and it really deserves a lot of credit and a lot of people are really you know full with gratitude towards that in a sense from a tactical point of view it was at the time when Russia came it was it was a bleak moment that's for sure nothing in a sense said that Syria's government was going to collapse at all and we could also sense a lot of Russia's support before that and I think the main proof of that Russia support was that no may to operation whatsoever started in Syria between the year 2011 and year 2015 in a sense so Russia was always behind the scenes you know the Security Council and that all all helped keep the state on its feet now militarily the surge of air power especially did help turn the tide and also most importantly the psychological factor you know the the rebels the militants they they suddenly felt that the Russians are coming here and now we are not only fighting a government that is on a regime so to speak that is whose fault is imminent now there is a super power so that you know affected their morale that affected their performance in a sense and that helped sway other countries in the region like Turkey for example whose and still is unhappy with what the United States is doing in northeastern Syria to come to their senses and and try having realized that the fall of the government in Damascus was never going to be imminent come to their senses and start you know some sort of a constructive role I think all in all both politically militarily and even economically if you want to put it that way it helped a lot and a lot of Syrians I can assure you I appreciate that and I woke up we'll leave it there if you can just hold on just a few minutes we'll come back to you to talk about other issues in the meantime then
