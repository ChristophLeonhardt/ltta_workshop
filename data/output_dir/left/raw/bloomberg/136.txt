1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:03,759
This is the all new Nike Vapormax.

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:07,669
190 dollar running shoe that took 7 years
to make.

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:11,769
The upper is pretty standard Nike, but the
sole is, well, it's different.

4
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:16,219
There's no foam, there's no rubber, just a
system of air bladders.

5
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,910
These sneakers may well be the future of the
company, but are they any good?

6
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:25,250
We took them for a spin to find out.

7
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:32,770
So these things look like space ships but
otherwise the NASA factor is kinda low honestly.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,720
On a run, the shoe doesn't feel drastically
unique.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,540
It's not like bouncing on a trampoline or
running on a water bed mattress.

10
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,610
And it's the subtle things that kinda stand
out.

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,710
They're really light.

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,720
And they're more flexible than they look.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,600
There's also a good bit of pop, but it doesn't
feel synthetic, and the bounce is mostly in

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,690
the heel.

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:57,210
Someone who tends to run striking with the
middle or the front of their foot won't even

16
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,869
notice that much.

17
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:03,650
Maybe the most impressive thing is that these
little jellyfish bladders didn't pop like

18
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,800
water balloons when we came down hard on a
curb or a subway grate.

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,230
Another selling point is durability.

20
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,550
The air bladders are filled with nitrogen,
which, unlike foam cushioning, won't break

21
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,550
down.

22
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:21,480
So the shoes can theoretically go a lot farther
than 500 miles, which is kinda the standard

23
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,560
life of a running shoe.

24
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,970
Finally the sole is modular- look for nike
to start monkeying with these airpods to make

25
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,330
versions that are more minimal, more cushioned,
more firm, etc.

26
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:38,740
In truth, how vapormax sneakers perform on
a run isn't as important as one might think.

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,611
Three quarters of athletic shoes never see
a track or a field, they're bought for the

28
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,360
street, the style if you will.

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,170
They're bought more often for walking.

30
00:01:47,170 --> 00:00:00,000
These sneakers do that just fine.
