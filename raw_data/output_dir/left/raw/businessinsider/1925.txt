00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,990
we would first of all if we see somebody

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,630
drinking more than usual or asking

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,420
different groove for the drinks we tried

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,540
to communicate between us all first to

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,020
say maybe stop the passenger or the

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,359
customer from drinking after that if

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,279
they continue or if they've managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,380
find a loophole we would probably assess

9
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,840
them and suggest drinking water or go to

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,130
the seats and having<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font>

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,090
aggressive we have different threat

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:38,760
levels that we can adhere to and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

14

<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get to level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three which</font>

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:46,800
with another passenger or crew as in

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,180
punching kicking then we would have what

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,059
we would call a passenger restraint

19
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,530
situation where we would go in guns

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,270
blazing and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the passenger is</font>

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,090
restraint in the seeds we have body

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,199
buckles and and we do get restraint

23
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,390
training as well which does help so

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,760
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got somewhere some ninja</font>

25
00:01:08,760 --> 00:00:00,000
moves that we can pull out enough oxygen
