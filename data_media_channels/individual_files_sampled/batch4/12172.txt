very that's fine we'll make do you'll notice I'm coming to you right now from the Christmas War Rooms I because I woke up this morning and my city is on fire and now while most of the people at the Daily wire live on the other side of the hill or the little east or whatever I am directly in line with where the fire is just raining down like Sodom and Gomorrah on Hollywood and so I sent out a couple tweets this morning you know basically I think the images of la burning are what people think it's like to commute to the Daily wire just going down into the infernos and to hell you know abandon all hope ye who enter here I also pointed out that God does not paint with a terribly subtle brush because people got very angry about this on Twitter they they said that it was similar to when lefties claimed the Hurricanes were divine vengeance for Trump but it actually is a completely different joke the point here is that Hollywood is figuratively burning itself to the ground you've seen Harvey Weinstein you've seen all of these major actors celebrities Kevin Spacey heads of studios agents everybody is being accused of sexual harassment Ben Affleck although you don't hear about that anymore because he's too valuable to Hollywood and so it's all figuratively burning and then God with that little you know a little brush brush the truck it makes it much more vivid because no it's literally burning to the ground that's quite a relation between the symbol and the symbolized so people get into all of that and you know they say that aha politics is show business for ugly people which is true that DC's Hollywood for ugly people and if there's one ugly person who's succeeded in both that would be Democratic senator Al Franken of New Jersey he remember he was on Saturday Night Live and now he is professionally groping women in our nation's capital in the swampland and so there have been these accusations bubbling for a few weeks now they say as people have been harping on Roy Moore in Alabama they've said what about Al Franken Al Franken posed for photos groping women groping troops grabbing people's derriere at state fairs that sort of thing and he's denied it he said he's reflecting over Thanksgiving whatever but they haven't gotten him yet just today that all changed there are now 28 Democratic senators his colleagues people from his caucus who are calling on him to resign this is one day after John Conyers who has been a United States representative since I think 1751 he's been around he's been there since the Johnson administration 15 men 13 women who were his colleagues in the Senate are calling on him to resign and so here's a live feed from senator Franken's office this morning I deserve good thing I am entitled to my share of happiness I refuse to beat myself up I am an attractive person I am fun to be with daily affirmation with Stuart Smalley Stuart Smalley is a caring nurturer a member of several 12-step programs but not a licensed therapist I'm going to do a terrific show today and I'm going to help people because I'm good enough I'm smart enough and doggone it people like me turns out that's fake news because people don't like Al Franken because he gropes women I guess and it isn't just that I actually I was showing this clip around today people forget that he was on Saturday Night Live they forget whenever I see senator Franken trying to grill someone during Senate testimony or whatever all I can see is Stuart Smalley I'm good enough I'm smart enough I grope enough and gosh darn it but anyway he very likely will have to resign now and and this is a trade do not think for one second that the Democrats have woken up they said oh you know we were wrong about sexual assault for so long and coincidentally we'll do it at exactly the moment when it isn't politically advantageous for us anymore to support sexual assailants so there's nothing organic about this this began because Bill Clinton is no longer useful because Hillary Clinton will never be President and there have been these allegations bubbling up but they know they can only go after Roy Moore and Roy Moore by the way it's not about Roy Moore it's not about this Alabama Senate seat this is all a proxy for Donald Trump if we can get Roy more on these decades-old allegations about bad things with women than we can we can bring it all the way up to Donald Trump if we can get them to crack on Roy Moore we get them to crack on Donald Trump but oops we can't have any credibility on those issues if we don't get rid of John Conyers if we don't get rid of Bob Menendez if we don't get rid of Al Franken they've already had to deal with Anthony Weiner and the myriad other politicians who have been accused of impropriety with women now there is a trade that's going on so John Conyers Nancy Pelosi initially stood up for the guy said he shouldn't resign and then eventually she came and said okay get rid of him why because he's politically useless now he's about 150 years old he in a totally safe Democrat seat he's endorsed his son to take over the seat his son by the way who we've just learned has wrapped about how his dad as a womanizer and he's a player and all this and that and how his mother went to prison so they know it's a safe seat and the kid might actually win it who knows Al Franken is another one we have the governor of Minnesota who is a Democrat his name is Mark Dayton so if Frank and resigns they'll be able to appoint another Democrat senator nothing ventured nothing gained right no harm no foul it's okay there there Senate numbers are still doing just fine Bob Menendez is where the rubber meets the road and it's how you know that these guys are totally full of it because they're willing to throw people who are useless to them under the bus began with Donna Brazile her through hillary clinton the house of clinton under the bus they threw up now franken and before that john conyers but bob menendez can't go now what does Bob Menendez accused of if you listen to the mainstream media tell it he's accused of nothing there were these old discredited allegations that in the Dominican Republic yet a few dances Italian PSA's with dances a few dalliance with underaged prostitutes but it's totally discredited it was run on one of those fake news right wing websites not so Bob Menendez on trial for corruption a lot of slick dealings from Bob Menendez in New Jersey not terribly surprising but federal prosecutors made a point of saying on Monday that they are not convinced that the underage prostitute allegations are false they're not sure it's not saying he certainly did it but it totally undercuts the mainstream media narrative that these are discredited that it isn't true so we're seeing this all burning down but until we abandoned as until they offer one of their own one of the own Democrats who's accused of these things where it actually has a political cost to them I just don't believe in you shouldn't believe it either now before we move on there is so much more apocalypse to talk about there is so many more signs at the end times and some of the best news of the day by the way but before we do that we have got to talk about zip recruiter so I'm here it's very nice I'm cozy here today and I'm sipping on my cup of Cocco FFA and I'm by the Christmas tree and wearing my pajamas or whatever but I'm actually going to say some good things about the michael noland daily wire staff for a change because they managed to throw this all together and fight back the blazes that are burning in the hills right now so that we could do this show it is very important to hire good people and if you're in need of great talent for your business but you're short on time you don't have to get lost in a huge stack of resumes and headshots since we're coming from Hollywood and since we're barely in the final days of Hollywood here I can tell you this whole town is basically based on a group of people bringing stacks and stacks of headshots and resumes to offices and then people are specifically hired to take those headshots and resumes and throw them out without anybody you can make an personnel decision looking at them they're just useless it's an old way of doing things it's to time intents if you don't have to do it if hiring could be easier what if it were as streamlined what if there were less time-consuming so even when you're busy you can still be smart about the way you're hot you can hire now you know quality hires keep your business moving forward and it can take a lot of time to find a good candidate but the zip recruiter is different that's why you have zip recruiter with the zip recruiter you can post your job to over 100 of the web's leading job boards with the click of a button just one click you can rest easy knowing your job is being seen by the right candidates free q√≠n talk about this I'm a millennial if I can't do something with one click for not very much money sir you're free sitting in a chair you know I don't want to do it and that's that's why I sip recruiter makes it so easy puts it smart matching technology to work actively notifying qualified candidates about your job within minutes of posting so you receive the best possible matches sometimes you post a job out there and then you just wait and nothing happens that's because the talent the job is out there but the talent aren't being notified that it's available zip recruiter makes that happen unlike other hiring sites it doesn't depend on the right candidates to find you it finds them you can even actually get a start on the interview process by adding some screening questions to your job post to help identify qualified candidates when we were hiring Marshall if we had only done this if we'd ever said have you ever been commit to insane asylums and walked around muttering on the sidewalk we would have avoided a lot of headaches folks I'm just telling you it's a really important aspect of it now there is no wonder that 80% of employers who post as a recruiter get a quality Canada through the site in just one day 24 hours that is pretty co5 a so the easy to use super cooter dashboard lets you manage hiring zip recruiter is the smartest way to hire find out today why zip recruiter has been used by growing businesses of all sizes all industries find the most qualified job candidate with immediate results and right now my listeners can post jobs on zip recruiter for free that is a price I can afford for free just go to zip recruiter com /m k s you know what that stands for that's the Michael Nolt show zip recruiter comm / MKS one more time to try for free go to where zip recruiter com / M K s now I we had there was a lot of hand-wringing especially on the right when we were going to hire a president in 2016 and we were all very nervous the president Trump would not keep any of his promises he wasn't a real conservative we hadn't seen him exhibit conservatism or right-wing views in his life one of the promises that he made he was very insistent on this was to move the capital of Israel to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem now you know with Gomorrah on the sea by fire with Washington DC in the slum swamp imploding the most prophetic news to the of the day as the Donald Trump made good on that promise here is president Trump on the campaign trail we will move the American Embassy to the Eternals capital of the Jews people Jerusalem when he said it I didn't believe it either by the way I didn't think it would happen because Republicans have campaigned on this for years ever since after the Gingrich revolution after the big Republican wins in the house in 1995 they passed the Jerusalem embassy act what does it mean it means what it says they decided that they would move the US embassy from Tel Aviv where all of the embassies practically are in Israel to Jerusalem to recognize Jerusalem is the Eternal City and capital of the Jewish people and of Israel now the problem with this is that Palestinian Arabs claim the city for themselves and that's where we see the palestinian-israeli conflict what did President Clinton do when this law was passed he signed a waiver and said that they couldn't do it same with President Bush same with President Obama they all cited national security concerns we can't do it'll basically piss off our neighbors too much and we don't want to have to deal with that so what does President Trump do does he do what three of his predecessors did in violation of the law and contravention of the law here as president Trump this morning therefore I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel while previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise they failed to deliver today I am delivering is delivering that's what he does he's the deliverer and not just that there were some reports before that Donald Trump would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel but not moved the US embassy so you kind of get all the nice press releases but it doesn't have much of an effect even that by the way would have been an act of moral courage but he didn't do that he followed through with the concrete action you would always hear on the campaign trail Donald Trump's say well I build things I build a wall I'm very good at building things he would always use concrete examples low energy Jeb lyin Ted crooked Hillary read these graphic vivid examples and it's how he makes his rhetoric so effective even make America great again it's very concrete creates an image in your mind and that's what he's doing here it would be very on Trumpy it would be anti trumpian to say Jerusalem is the capital of Israel but we're not going to move the embassy he has to follow through with that concrete action and that's what he did more than I expected more than a lot of commentators expected this is an act of real political courage and moral clarity four people say that Donald Trump has no moral vision or no ideological vision of the world it's hard to say that now this was a difficult act there was no reason he had to do it he easily could have gotten away without doing it it runs a lot of risks by moving the embassy to Jerusalem but he understood that it's the right thing to do and it sends a clear moral message to the world and it's a reason for the world of American moral leadership so much of what you heard during Barack Obama's era was the United States apologizing for crimes that it didn't commit and at the west by the way didn't even commit as he's talking about Islamic terrorism he starts talking about the Crusades one as if the first crusade were some bad war that the West should apologize for which it wasn't and two as though a war that happened a thousand years ago or eight hundred years ago is morally equivalent to what's happening today that is politically irrelevant as it is today and Donald Trump isn't doing that so I guess the real sign of the apocalypse we have Hollywood burning that might be it we have the the American Embassy being reconstructed in Jerusalem maybe that's it but Donald Trump being the voice of moral clarity in the world is probably the Primus example that we're in the end times and bring it on that's not so bad with that I think we should bring on our panel but before by the way before we bring on our panel I've got to tell you we and we have a good panel today we have Lauren Cooley from the Washington Examiner that's a real journalist that's not just a fake news journalist and we have Jacob berry but before that we got to talk about ring rings mission is to make neighborhoods safer today over 1 million people use the amazing ring video doorbell to help protect their homes ring knows that home security begins at the front door but it doesn't end there so they extend that same level of security with their ring floodlight cam you know this when you go to rob somebody's house and then the light goes on and then you scurry away and decide to confess your sins and really take a hard look at your life because that floodlight now what ring does is it puts a camera in there so even if someone comes up and steals your floodlight it's already uploaded to the to the cloud and you can see who did it you can access it from anywhere it really is the future in in the old days we used to have neighborhood watches to keep communities safe now it ring is the way to do it it's so much easier it's it's I think neighborhood watches are a thing in the past this is how you do it you you could be anywhere you could be at work you could be on the beach someone rings your bell you can get a video feed right to them you can talk you can see what's going on you can make sure they're not trying to do you any harm and whether you're home or away the ring floodlight cam also keeps an eye on your home from everywhere it offers the ultimate in home security with high visibility floodlights powerful HD camera puts security in your own hands right now if you're a Michael Nolt show listener you can save up to 150 dollars off a ring home security kit when you go to ring.com slash Knowles canna wles just like Beyonce ring comm slash Knowles that is ring.com slash Knowles they did this a great study in one of the bad neighborhoods of LA and they gave at a bunch of a bunch of ring equipment it reduced home burglaries by fifty five percent within six months or something like that unbelievable stuff ring comm slash Knowles okay let's bring on our panel Loren Cooley from the Washington Examiner thank you for being here and Jacob Jacob are you sitting in my office are you sitting in my studio I escaped from the sane asylum and ended up in the basement of the Daily wire I don't know how that happened it's very fitting there's something very fitting about that well that's okay I would be upset that you're sitting in my studio but I am coming from war on Christmas central right now with a hot cup of cocoa FFA so that that's okay I can get over it there is insane news this is why we couldn't just cancel the show today this is unbelievable I was watching this morning as I should have been commuting to the Daily wire watching that incredible press conference from President Trump Lauren let's begin with you this has been promised for long time there have been a lot of national security risks was this the right thing to do for president Trump with regard to all of the national security risks it entails yeah absolutely so like you said this is something that not everyone expected but I'm starting to believe that if we can expect one thing from Donald Trump it's that he's going to do what he says he's going to do there's been many different campaign promises that he's followed through on and that's not your typical politician by any means obviously president Trump is not our typical politician but the interesting thing here is like you said he didn't have to follow through on this in the sense that other presidents haven't followed through on this and there's a lot of risk involved but I think sometimes doing the right thing is risky otherwise everyone would be doing the right thing so when it comes to moral clarity it's exciting to see that we have a president that isn't just gonna do it's politically expedient isn't gonna do necessarily the easiest thing the path of least resistance but he's actually doing something that takes a lot of guts and we may have some pushback for but it's the right thing to do and we've got a guy in office that's willing to do the right thing Jacob why did he do this is this by the way going to be the beginning of the much promised Trump World War 3 because as World War 3 by making our our friends over in the Middle East very angry at us or is there some political motive that's going on here why this move why now why is he the president to do it after 20 years I think he wants to make history that's why I think he's doing it I'm not saying that his motivations are bad I think they're very well-intentioned but I honestly do think that he's doing this because hey I'm going to be that president that Republican president who actually kept that promise and now he's in the history books II reckon he's the first US presidents recognized Jerusalem as the true capital of Israel now as far as the starting World War 3 I think we're gonna see a lot of virtue signaling from the left and we might get some blowback from radical Islam Islamist but I honestly think that as far as World War 3 is concerned I don't think that's going to happen I think I think we're gonna see a lot of pushback but outside of that no real international damage outside of some UN delicates just grandstanding on it that's the only reason the UN exists anyways just for bad people to grandstand but I do think also these stories are related the store maybe not the fire the fire its just be unrelated but all of the sexual assault reckoning happening on the left and president Trump doing very well in office I think there's no coincidence that the reason they're ramping this up the reason they're willing to claim Al Franken's scalp and John Conyers scalp and and really reckon with these issues is that they have to run on this in 2018 and 2020 Donald Trump is doing too well I think they were banking on running on Trump doing a terrible job crashing the economy starting trade war is starting World War three but it just isn't happening the economy is growing very strongly he was able to get this major legislative win with tax reform he's able handle foreign policy he's he's really had political courage even as a Republican yeah obviously we see this with the the Jerusalem embassy move but he's done a decent job of wrangling massive deregulation kept his promise on originalist judges is packing the courts with his judges so they're not going to be able to run on that eye they just have to hit him on sexual assault claims or whatever lauren is that going to work are they going to be able to drag these girls from 30 years ago back up is it are these allegations if they fire Frank and they fire Conyers and reclaim the moral high ground or these allegations enough to win in 2018 and 2020 I don't think they are and here's why I'm going to tide the Israel embassy move into this sexual assault conversation so the left has done a great job trying to say that Republicans and conservatives have lost the moral high ground and they keep hammering an issue long enough some of the religious conservative base may start to believe it may start to lose faith in the president but by actually doing something so bold with Israel with our foreign policy when it comes to you know our greatest a lie which has a lot of historical and biblical context and means a lot to social conservatives I think this foreign policy move and win actually helps him regain moral high-ground despite all the claims with sexual assault having to deal with President Trump in his past because there is also a world in which I can totally believe voters saying you're throwing out these allegations from 40 years ago and they might be true they may not be true if they're true I feel bad for the victims but my political priorities are bigger than unsubstantiated allegations I could see that happening it might be their best shot though Jacob where does this end does it end are they gonna end right before they get Bob Menendez is it gonna topple over into Bob Menendez is it gonna bring down the entire United States Senate sexual impropriety is a job requirement politics basically where what is the endgame here is it just are we all going to be sitting around looking like the disgusting fallen sinners that we are well I think so and quite frankly here's what's happening like oh this Republican did this but this Democrat did this just wait they're gonna go into Christmas recess and all of a sudden the finger-pointing stops if Al Franken and John Connors resigns now if they don't that might be a different story but I think that or with more if more gets elected then and he doesn't get censured then then the finger-pointing will continue those three but if those three things become unraveled then I think all of a sudden it'll just die down and all the sexual harassment finger-pointing that's done by these politicians we won't hear about anymore because like you said it's almost a job requirement for a senator to have some weird fetish that we have to hear about that is true and I don't want to hear about them you know let's hope it dies that after Christmas and the bad guys just resign or go away I don't want to hear about it okay we have much more to talk about speaking of President Trump being right and surprising all of us turns out he was coincidentally right about terror threats in the United Kingdom against the government of Teresa may we also need to talk about a woman marrying her chandelier and the few your super race of human mice but before we can get to any of that I have to say goodbye to Facebook in YouTube you're gonna have to leave my living room the Christmas War Rooms and headquarters for the war on Christmas you can't sip on any more cups of cocoa FFA unless you go to daily well I can't right now now what do you get to go to daily wire.com well one you can listen to the conversation with our very own super big boss man ben shapiro that conversation will be happening on december 12th december 12th that's next week at 5 p.m. Eastern 2 p.m. Pacific if you subscribe to The Daily wire right now you can ask him any question you want you know frequently been fires me and today was a very graphic version of that as the whole place burned up and I'm gonna log in I'm gonna ask him questions I think you should too it is it's a great opportunities just gonna sit there and take them basically as they come in so if you want to be able to talk to Ben and get the answers to change your life do that what else do you get you get me you get the under Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show blah blah blah you also get the leftist tears tumblr I'm feeling very deprived right now I accidentally left my left is tears tumblr at the office yesterday I figured I would be in the studio today so I've had to drink my hot coco FFA out of these very inferior very subpar devices they certainly couldn't store a single drop of left as tears and by the way they are going to be flowing they're gonna be flowing from the four corners of the earth now that Donald Trump has moved to Jerusalem Amba City I remove the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem they're gonna be pouring out everywhere it is gonna be really dangerous you're gonna be wiped away in a flood so make sure you get the left this tears tumblr you can serve those tears hot or cold always salty and delicious go to daily wire calm right now we'll be right back more great news there is more great news coming out of this news cycle some how so you might have remembered a week or two ago Donald Trump retweeted Britain first this very far-right group tweet Muslim videos videos of Muslims doing bad sorts of things and he gotten a lot of trouble for this and actually the Tory prime minister of the UK Teresa may criticize Donald Trump for doing it said he shouldn't have done it and it was bad and unhelpful so Donald Trump responded to her and said Theresa May don't focus on me focus on the destructive radical Islamic terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom we are doing just fine now at the time is why are you antagonizing an ally there's no reason for this we've just learned that Theresa mate was almost assassinated by Islamic terrorists recently an Islamist man was planning to blow up 10 Downing Street the center of the UK government before his plot was foiled by British intelligence Lauren does Donald Trump just keep accidentally being right about these things what can you tell me about this plot so I think Donald Trump in a sense is accidentally right in in the sense that he knows there's a threat in the UK specifically when it comes to Islamic terrorists so is the video accurate of what it was reported was depicted a lot of people said no president Trump watched it he thought that it depicted a broader issue going on in Europe obviously he has his finger on the pulse he understands that there is an issue going on there so I actually equate this kind of to liberal journalists their worldview is that President Trump is absolutely terrible and so don't jump to conclusions and report fake news because they hear a rumor and they're like that makes sense to my worldview that makes sense I'm gonna publish it it has to be true and it's not so in the same way these videos not necessarily accurate not necessarily factual but it meets Donald Trump's worldview and that's that is long terrorism is becoming more and more rampant in the UK and so when he retweeted those videos and that information it may not specifically been accurate but it fits the worldview of Donald Trump and I think his worldview is very accurate in the broad scheme of things this does happen on both sides both sides the left and the right I'm perfectly willing to admit when we hear some information that confirms our suspicions about the world we're more likely to run with it even if the evidence isn't there were more likely to say well this isn't true but it confirms the greater truth I see that happening on the left all the time it does happen on the right as well Jacob what is the threat here how does Europe deal with this obviously Europe is going to deal with Islamic terrorism and as Islamic threats that are different than the United States does how do they mitigate the risk and what does this have to do with it with all of the other European politics we've seen this year the brexit the pushing back against diversity throughout the United Kingdom well first of all I think they need to get a handle on their immigration crisis because right now especially you see in Germany and France they're trying to censor places like Austria the Czech Republic Poland that are putting into place stricter migration policies and so they need to deal with that first because that is where the red is coming from they're just having open borders and so they're not vetting any of the immigrants and there are good immigrants coming in but there's also as we see with some with some of the incidents in Paris and in and in Belgium we're seeing our excuse me Brussels we're seeing these terrorists slip in and so that's what they need to do right off the bat now are they willing to do it well Angela Merkel's seem to hint that she might be realizing oh maybe this was a bad idea so I think that's where they go they want to start and I think as far as brexit was concerned I think that was more of a reaction to the British wanted to stay British they didn't the British don't want to be for his terrible racists I can't believe the English want to stay engaged exactly they're like we don't want to be we don't want to be French we don't want of the Germans we want to be English so I think that was that was more of a reaction to we want to keep our culture as opposed to reaction with how the EU is handling Islamic immigration into the into the countenance absolutely and I actually want to talk about this a little more but we might have to do a separate show on it because there's much more important news and another sign of the Apocalypse a woman is marrying her chandelier a woman named Amanda Liberty well named 33 years old says she will soon marry a chandelier that she bought online she described how she kisses and cuddles the antique which is 57 years older than she is she says that she is emotionally and get ready to cringe sexually gratified by the chandelier Lauren isn't this illegal isn't this an example of prostitution isn't this trafficking she purchased her soon-to-be spouse yeah well I don't object but what I will say is this the fact that we validate this and say you know congratulations on your you know upcoming nuptials to a chandelier just shows that we're starting to really accept mental health issues as not only the norm but as like something to celebrate and encourage this is not the only example that I've seen in the news recently about women or men becoming you know attracted to random objects there's a woman who wants to marry a ferris wheel and another one I think who married a bridge I mean this is just bizarre and with the lady in the chandelier I read that she actually has multiple other chandeliers that she also loves but she's only gonna marry the one and so I just went after the chandelier she's marrying I mean I would want you know a monogamous relationship that way I guess she's polyamorous I guess she has a whole harem of lamps and like flash bulbs and things like that we actually do have a clip of the woman with her beloved balance by you before that looks like sexual assault to me she was clearly saying oh no and he said all yes oh no oh yeah that is no good that's gonna be the next Hollywood story too follows Lumiere from Beauty and the Beast really awful now Lauren pointed out we are indulging these delusions and these mental illnesses but Jacob how far back does this go it seems to me that the purpose of indulging a woman who has a sexual fetish to be sexual with inanimate objects which I believe qualifies her to be a u.s. senator if we indulge that that only mainstream's the problem it only enhances the problem there was a woman earlier this year who married herself she had a ceremony with a mirror and she married herself in front of friends and family how far does this go if we're going to say no clearly it is not marriage if you are hugging your light bulb that is clearly not marriage then aren't we just hateful bigots doesn't that undo so much of the argumentation and so much of the logic behind redefining marriage not just to include same-sex monogamous couples but to include polygamous couples polyamorous couples in sexual relationships if we yell at the lady and we tell the lady who's marrying her lumi√®re that it isn't marriage doesn't that undo all of the logic of our progressive period yes and I think that's why you see some some of these far left hacks going for it I want to know who these ministers are that are marrying these people I mean if they should be defrocked immediately they're just as crazy as this woman marrying her her lantern or her chandelier or whatever this is but I'm sure they're Unitarians our judge with nothing could be I just to your broader point yes I think that this thread because they've realized the left has realized they've opened this Pandora's box and they don't know where it's going to end because right after the Supreme Court declared that homosexual marriage was legal the first thing was the the radical Mormon said hey we're next we want to have our marriages to our five four wives so I think that I do think that that's why we're not seeing as much of a push back that's why you know they used to be when people would do this crazy stuff it would be all over the news now now you barely hear about it it's you know you might hear it on some some oddball news outlet but now it's been kind of quiet because they know once they pull that string they have to close the Pandora's box plus the left has made all of these things so unfunny that this is obviously hilarious a woman is marrying her chandelier I feel bad for her she clearly has some mental illness but the act itself is very funny drag queens are funny but the left makes them so solemn and so unfunny we have to treat it very seriously and you know yes I feel my heart is bleeding or whatever Lauren is there going to be any sort of cultural shift backward we've seen Donald Trump using humor to point out the absurdities of political correctness the absurdities of the culture warrior left is there going to be any push backward when it comes to marriage or sexual morality or are we just living in decadent times here to stay actually you know I think that it used to be the left was so progressive and pushing the boundaries but today the real like rebellious counterculture is the right it's conservatives and so studies actually show that generations even younger than Millennials so kids that are in high school and starting college now actually kind of find an appeal to conservative values traditional social values in a sense because it's cool to be different it's cool to push the boundaries and obviously the Hollywood left the culture across really across the globe at this point is so liberal in not in just a sense of freedom and the ability of new things but liberal in the sense of just wacky craziness accepting mental illness these things I think we will see a shift back not necessarily for the morality of it but I think just because if you push too far you almost push into the other side nothing says cool guy like cardigan sweaters and hair and sockless loafers I know I'm with you we're the new punk man it's great so the speaking of mental illness and the future of humanity and the apocalypse I think we've reached the end we've officially reached the end which is that the National Institutes of Health have now used your taxpayer dollars to create quote humanized mice mice implanted with tissues taken from aborted babies jacob my first question is there any way to make that more horrifying that's like the most horrifying thing I've ever heard well I wouldn't know why they didn't use Turtles because I would see like to see a real incarnation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles but to your point no this is this is that humans playing God and whenever humans play God we always screw it up it always leads to chaos and so I think that I think they for one thing I want to refined I want all the money back that they spent on this ridiculous project it's not worth it and it's going to have dire consequences because then right now they're using they're they're using aborted fetuses right well next they're going what if it's a live person what if it's a person in a coma who could potentially wake up I mean when are we going to draw the line of when can we farm these parts of these human body parts I donate Marshall if it is for science and I have to I'm I am willing to donate my producer Marshall it will further the human race it will further scientific progress and thank you for your sacrifice Marshall they are using a human bone marrow liver and thymus in these animals so it's not the brain yet it isn't like a poor little human brain and a rat saying like kill me kill me by the for decades and decades the primary battle in bio ethical debates has been abortion and obviously we've made great strides toward a reasonable the reasonable side of life we've made great strides on pro-life forty years but leon kass the the president's philosopher the head of President Bush's Council on bioethics inquiry is a bio conservative but he's predicted these things that cloning would become the next great debate that hybrids and chimeras would be the next great debate Lauren I noticed we've missed the debate they're just funding this stuff with taxpayer money without asking us is this now going to take over abortion as the the real bioethical issue or are Americans going to say oh well who cares you can keep funding it I don't really understand what it is anyway well I think if you ask most of Americans they would say humans are humans and God it's God humans are not God and so why would we be you know dabbling in this but I do think it's a little more tricky it's a little more difficult to understand than the concept just of abortion so it may take a while for people to wake up to it but I kind of equate this with the artificial intelligence debate you know obviously our super computers aren't being hybrid meshed with humans and there's not that debate of when do you take human DNA away from someone whether whether they're an organ donor there's somebody who is just in a coma there's not that debate but at the same time these are the things where we have to actually think about it and say are we going to be successful bridging these mice humans and are they gonna become superheroes or super villains I mean that's something far down the line but it's not ridiculous to be talking about but I do think we've missed the debate we're already paying for it whether we like it or not it does sound ridiculous though when you think of like an evil Mouse with a moustache in a cape flying around with a human brain or something but it's a 20 surround the corner yeah the brave new world has arrived and it does seem a little bit apocalyptic all right panel thank you for being here we have Loren Cooley from the Washington Examiner we have Jacob berry from my desk apparently for some reason that is our show we will be talking much more this is a little preview in in the Christmas war rooms here we will be talking about the war on Christmas I feel passionately about this subject and I think some of my fellow conservatives do not appreciate the importance of it so we will be down in the bunkers discussing that get your mailbag questions and we'll be changing your lives for the better hopefully tomorrow be sure to do that in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael nul show come back tomorrow we will do it all again the

for science and I have to I am willing to donate my producer marshal it will further the human race it will further scientific progress and thank you for your sacrifice Marshall Thank You panel for your input it was fantastic so good and now it's time for me to put on my Rachel Maddow glasses and give you my final thoughts president Trump showed real moral courage today by officially recognizing Jerusalem as real capital will it affect him in the long run and with the fake news I don't think so I think this is a make America great again moment well that's all the time we have for today I'm
