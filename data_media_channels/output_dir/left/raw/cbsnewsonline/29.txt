1
00:00:02,135 --> 00:00:03,736
HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF 

2
00:00:03,736 --> 00:00:11,478
PROTESTERS, SINCE THE 

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:12,045
NOMINATION WAS ANNOUNCED. 

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:13,012
APART FROM HER, THE ONLY OTHER 

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:13,947
SENATOR WHO HAS NOT INDICATED 

6
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,482
WHICH WAY HE WILL VOTE IS 

7
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:21,788
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, 

8
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:26,493
THEY VOTED YES FOR CLOTURE, IT 

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:31,297
PASSED 51-49, ALONG PARTY 

10
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:36,970
LINES, THE ONLY ONE TO GO 

11
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,405
AGAINST HIS CONFIRMATION WAS 

12
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,242
LISA MURKOWSKI. 

13
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:42,975
A CBSN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR 

14
00:00:42,975 --> 00:00:43,942
AND A CAPITOL HILL  REPORTER 

15
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:46,546
FOR THE HILL, MOLLY, THANK YOU 

16
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:49,816
FOR JOINING US, I WANT TO START 

17
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,251
WITH MURKOWSKI, I KNOW SHE 

18
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:55,889
VOTED NO TO MOVE IT FORWARD, I 

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:56,689
KNOW PEOPLE USUALLY SAY THAT'S 

20
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:57,891
AN INDICATION OF WHERE SHE WILL 

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,125
VOTE, DOES IT MEAN, AND HAVE WE 

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,994
HEARD ANYTHING FURTHER, THAT 

23
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,796
HER ACTUAL VOTE WILL BE NO? 

24
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:07,734
>> IT IS UNCLEAR AT THIS POINT, 

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,735
BUT GOING INTO THE CHAMBER, SHE 

26
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,103
TOLD REPORTERS THAT ESSENTIALLY 

27
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:13,373
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A GOOD MAN, 

28
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:14,574
BUT HE'S NOT THE RIGHT MAN FOR 

29
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,675
THE COURT AT THIS TIME, AND 

30
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,477
EARLIER THURSDAY, THE DAYS SEEM 

31
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:22,482
TO BE RUNNING TOGETHER, SHE MET 

32
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,149
WITH SEXUAL SURVIVORS FROM 

33
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,786
ALASKA IN HER OFFICE, THAT 

34
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:27,787
MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN IMPACT ON 

35
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,821
WHETHER OR NOT SHE WANTED TO 

36
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,689
MOVE THE NOMINATION FORWARDOR 

37
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:33,093
NOT, KEEP IN MIND, IF THE SENATE

38
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:38,398
DECIDED TO MOVE FORWARD, AND IN 

39
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:40,633
THIS WAY, THE SENATE WILL MAKE 

40
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:42,869
THE POST AND THE DECISION ON 

41
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:45,905
WHETHER TO CONFIRM OR NOT, ON 

42
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,040
SATURDAY AFTERNOON, AS LATE AS 

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,476
5:30 PM SATURDAY, AND AGAIN, A 

44
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:52,011
LOT CAN HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND 

45
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,912

TO SENATOR MURKOWSKI, COLLINS, 

49

AND FOR THE MOST PART, I'VE 

50
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:06,292
HEARD IT SAYING THAT WE ARE 

51
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,094
TRYING TO LET THEM KEEP IT TO 

52
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:13,099
THEIR OWN COUNSEL, NOT TRYING TO

53
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:17,803
PUSH THEM EITHER WAY, A NUMBER 

54
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:18,671
PROTESTERS, BUT THEY WERE SOON 

55
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,772
CLEARED OUT, IT'S A LOT MORE 

56
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,907
QUITE UP HERE THAN IT HAS BEEN 

57
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,675
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS.>> I WAS

STRUCK BY SENATOR FLAKE, HE 

59
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:32,085
WOULD VOTE YES, SOMETHING BIG 

60
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:32,952

LIFETIME, AND YOU NEVER KNOW 

65
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,463
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN OR 

66
00:02:44,463 --> 00:02:46,633
UNFOLD, AFTER ESSENTIALLY TWO

WHEN HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, 

72
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,687
MOST SENATORS HAVE A COVENANT 

73
00:03:08,687 --> 00:03:11,324
WITH THEIR ANSWERS, BARRING 

74
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:11,958
ANYTHING UNFORESEEN. 

75
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:15,528
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT, MANY OF 

76
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:20,066
THEM, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS,

77
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,099
DID NOT SEE THAT LETTER COMING 

78
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:21,968
OUT, OR THE ALLEGATIONS COMING 

79
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,503
OUT, UNTIL THE 11th HOUR, THAT 

80
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:31,377
IS SOMETHING, A REAR END 

81

APPEAR, UNTIL THE FINAL VOTE

00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:32,512
HAPPENS. 

83

KAVANAUGH, SHE WOULD GET INTO 

94
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,509
THE RACE, FACING A LOT OF 

95
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,244
PRESSURE FROM THE FOLKS WHO ARE

TO COLLINS, THERE HAVE BEEN VERY

106
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,777
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS, TO FORCE 

107
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,245
COLLINS TO VOTE AGAINST 

108
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,481

CONCLUSION, OF A CONFIRMATION

PROCESS THAT HAS BECOME SO 

146
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:34,527
DYSFUNCTIONAL IT LOOKS MORE LIKE

147
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,598
A CARICATURE OF A GUTTER LEVEL 

148
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,933

THE FIRST TO OPPOSE THEM, 

156
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:03,589
INCLUDING ONE ORGANIZATION THAT 

157
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,624
DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FILL IN

RACE TO ANNOUNCE THEIR 

166
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,347
OPPOSITION, BUT THEY WERE 

167
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,983
BEATEN TO THE PUNCH BY ONE OF 

168
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,920
OUR COLLEAGUES, WHO ACTUALLY 

169
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,854
ANNOUNCED OPPOSITION BEFORE THE

WAS EVEN KNOWN. 

172
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:46,365

PRODUCED SHORT-LIVED HEADLINES, 

184
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:14,060
WHICH ALTHOUGH DEBUNKED HOURS 

185
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:18,831
LATER, CONTINUED TO LIVE ON AND 

186
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:22,868
BE SPREAD THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. 

187
00:08:22,868 --> 00:08:26,505
INTEREST GROUPS HAVE ALSO SPENT 

188
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:29,108
AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF DARK 

189
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:33,679
MONEY OPPOSING THIS NOMINATION. 

190
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,881
OUR SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION 

191
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:40,953
PROCESS HAS BEEN IN STEADY 

192
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:42,955
DECLINE FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. 

193
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:47,326
ONE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE 

194
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,729
KAVANAUGH NOMINATION IS WHERE 

195
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:53,199
THE PROCESS HAS FINALLY HIT 

196
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,368
ROCK BOTTOM. 

197
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,004
AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, IT IS UP 

198
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,806
TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SENATOR TO 

199
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:06,846
DECIDE WHAT THE CONSTITUTION'S 

200
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,015
ADVICE AND CONSENT DUTY MEANS. 

201
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,550
INFORMED BY ALEXANDER HAMILTON

202
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:19,425
THIS -- HAMILTON'S, IN 1776, I 

203
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,693
HAVE INTERPRETED THIS TO MEAN 

204
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,429
THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS BROAD 

205
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:24,697
DISCRETION TO CONSIDER A 

206
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,332
NOMINEES PHILOSOPHY, WHEREAS MY 

207
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:30,002
DUTY AS A SENATOR IS TO FOCUS 

208
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,471
ON THE NOMINEES QUALIFICATIONS, 

209
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,774
AS LONG AS THAT NOMINEES 

210
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,809
PHILOSOPHY IS WITHIN THE 

211
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:42,982
MAINSTREAM OF JUDICIAL THOUGHT. 

212
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,784
I HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED LITMUS 

213
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:48,320
TESTS FOR JUDICIAL NOMINEES 

214
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,921
WITH RESPECT TO THEIR PERSONAL 

215
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:53,993
VIEWS OR POLITICS. 

216
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,062
BUT I FULLY EXPECT THEM TO BE 

217
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,800
ABLE TO PUT ASIDE ANY AND ALL 

218
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,968
PERSONAL PREFERENCES IN 

219
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:04,370
DECIDING THE CASES THAT COME 

220
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,010
BEFORE THEM. 

221
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,044
I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED THE 

222
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:13,145
PRESIDENT'S IDENTITY OR PARTY 

223
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,082
WHEN EVALUATING SUPREME COURT 

224
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:20,786
NOMINATIONS. 

225
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,987
AS A RESULT, I VOTED IN FAVOR 

226
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:27,660
OF JUSTICES ROBERTS AND ALITO, 

227
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,094
WHO WERE NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT 

228
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:32,264
BUSH, JUSTICES SOTOMAYOR AND 

229
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:35,968
KAGAN, WHO WERE NOMINATED BY 

230
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:40,172
PRESIDENT OBAMA, AND JUSTICE 

231
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:40,806
NEIL GORSUCH, WHO WAS NOMINATED 

232
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,708
BY PRESIDENT TRUMP.

233
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:48,314
>>> SO I BEGAN MY EVALUATION OF 

234
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,015
HIS NOMINATION BY REVIEWING HIS 

235
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,786
12 YEAR RECORD ON THE DC 

236
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,590
CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. 

237
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,924
INCLUDING HIS MORE THAN 300 

238
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,527
OPINIONS AND HIS MANY SPEECHES 

239
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:05,931
AND LOG REVIEW ARTICLES. 

240
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,135
19 ATTORNEYS, INCLUDING LAWYERS 

241
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,036
FROM THE NONPARTISAN 

242
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:13,405
CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE, 

243
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:16,542
BRIEFED ME MANY TIMES EACH WEEK,

244
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:20,279
AND ASSISTED ME IN EVALUATING 

245
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,283
THE JUDGES EXTENSIVE RECORD. 

246
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,153
I MET WITH JUDGE KAVANAUGH FOR 

247
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,354
MORE THAN TWO HOURS, AND MY 

248
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,624
OFFICE. 

249
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:32,958
I LISTENED CAREFULLY TO THE 

250
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,759
TESTIMONY AT THE COMMITTEE 

251
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:37,530
HEARINGS, I SPOKE WITH PEOPLE 

252
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,233
WHO KNEW HIM PERSONALLY, SUCH 

253
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,801
AS CONDOLEEZZA RICE, AND MANY 

254
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:44,670
OTHERS. 

255
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,538
AND I TALKED WITH JUDGE 

256
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:50,076
KAVANAUGH A SECOND TIME BY PHONE

257
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:53,846
FOR ANOTHER HOUR, TO ASK HIM A 

258
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,280
VERY SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL 

259
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:00,486
QUESTIONS. 

260
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,519
I ALSO HAVE MET WITH THOUSANDS 

261
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,756
OF MY CONSTITUENTS, BOTH 

262
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,991
ADVOCATES AND MANY OPPONENTS, 

263
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,595
REGARDING JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

264
00:12:09,595 --> 00:12:10,529
ONE CONCERN THAT I FREQUENTLY 

265
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,198
HEARD WAS THAT THE JUDGE WOULD 

266
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:14,833
BE LIKELY TO ELIMINATE THE 

267
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,837
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S VITAL 

268
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:20,538
PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH PRE-

269
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:22,842
EXISTIN CONDITIONS. 

270
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:26,679
I DISAGREE WITH THIS CONTENTION.

271
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:34,186
AND A DISSENT IN 7 SKY VS HOLDER

272
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:38,657
, JUDGE KAVANAUGH REJECTED A 

273
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:39,892
CHALLENGE ON NARROW PROCEDURAL 

274
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,192
GROUNDS, PRESERVING THE LAW IN 

275
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,128
FULL. 

276
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,663
MANY EXPERTS HAVE SAID THAT HIS 

277
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,299
DISSENT INFORMED JUSTICE 

278
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,301
ROBERTS OPINION UPHOLDING THE 

279
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:55,741
ACA AT THE SUPREME COURT. 

280
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,374
FURTHERMORE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

281
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:59,011
APPROACH TOWARD THE DOCTRINE OF 

282
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:03,482
SEVERABILITY IS NARROW, WHEN A 

283
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:04,450
PART OF A STATUTE IS CHALLENGED 

284
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,353
ON CONSTITUTIONAL GROUNDS, HE 

285
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:11,557
HAS ARGUED FOR SEVERING THE 

286
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,126
INVALID CLAUSE, AS SURGICALLY 

287
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,594
AS POSSIBLE. 

288
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:18,230
WHILE ALLOWING THE OVERALL LAW 

289
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,799
TO REMAIN INTACT. 

290
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,571
THIS WAS HIS APPROACH AND HIS 

291
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,439
DISSENT IN THE CASE INVOLVED A 

292
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,507
CHALLENGE TO THE STRUCTURE OF 

293
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:29,608
THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL 

294
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:30,743
PROTECTION BUREAU. 

295
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,646
IN HIS DISSENT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

296
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:38,384
ARGUED FOR QUOTE, SEVERING ANY 

297
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,818
PROBLEMATIC PORTIONS WHILE 

298
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,855
LEAVING THE REMAINDER INTACT.

299
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:46,758
". GIVEN THE CURRENT CHALLENGES 

300
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,895
TO THE ACA, PROPONENTS, 

301
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:51,730
INCLUDING MYSELF, OF 

302
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,699
PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH 

303
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,935
EXISTING CONDITIONS, SHOULD 

304
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,769
WANTED JUSTICE WHO WOULD TAKE 

305
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,573
JUST THIS KIND OF APPROACH.

306
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:05,110
>>> ANOTHER ASSERTION THAT I 

307
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,845
HAVE HEARD OFTEN IS THAT JUDGE 

308
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:10,349
KAVANAUGH CANNOT BE TRUSTED IF 

309
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,351
A CASE INVOLVING ALLEGED 

310
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,386
WRONGDOING BY THE PRESIDENT 

311
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:20,926
WERE TO COME BEFORE THE COURT. 

312
00:14:20,926 --> 00:14:21,793
THE BASIS FOR THIS ARGUMENT 

313
00:14:21,793 --> 00:14:23,696
SEEMS TO BE TWOFOLD, FIRST, 

314
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,395
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS WRITTEN 

315
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:26,097
THAT HE BELIEVES THAT CONGRESS 

316
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:27,966
SHOULD ENACT LEGISLATION TO 

317
00:14:27,966 --> 00:14:31,169
PROTECT PRESIDENTS FROM 

318
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:33,305
CRIMINAL PROSECUTION, OR CIVIL 

319
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:38,110
LIABILITY WHILE IN OFFICE. 

320
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,344
MR. PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE 

321
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:41,213
OPPONENTS MISS THE MARK ON THIS 

322
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,414
ISSUE. 

323
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,984
THE FACT THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

324
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,118
OFFERED THIS LEGISLATIVE 

325
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:49,188
PROPOSAL SUGGESTS THAT HE 

326
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,156
BELIEVES THAT THE PRESIDENT 

327
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:54,359
DOES NOT HAVE SUCH PROTECTION 

328
00:14:54,359 --> 00:14:56,428
CURRENTLY.

329
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,666
>>> SECOND, THERE ARE SOME WHO 

330
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,700
ARGUE THAT GIVEN THE CURRENT 

331
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,804
SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, 

332
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:06,672
PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD NOT EVEN 

333
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,973
BE ALLOWED TO NOMINATE A 

334
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,508
JUSTICE. 

335
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:13,278
THAT ARGUMENT IGNORES OUR 

336
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,147
RECENT HISTORY. 

337
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,716
PRESIDENT CLINTON IN 1993 

338
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,819
NOMINATED JUSTICE GINSBURG 

339
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,554
AFTER THE WHITEWATER 

340
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,222
INVESTIGATION WAS ALREADY 

341
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,091
UNDERWAY. 

342
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:32,564
AND SHE WAS CONFIRMED 96-3. THE 

343
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,732
NEXT YEAR, JUST THREE MONTHS 

344
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,468
AFTER AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL, 

345
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,338
ROBERT FISK, WAS NAMED TO LEAD 

346
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,939
THE WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION, 

347
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,675
PRESIDENT CLINTON NOMINATED 

348
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:50,783
JUSTICE BREYER, HE WAS 

349
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:56,321
CONFIRMED 87-9.

350
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,189
>>> SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE 

351
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,057
NOT HESITATED TO RULE AGAINST 

352
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:58,924
THE PRESIDENTS WHO HAVE 

353
00:15:58,924 --> 00:15:59,291
NOMINATED THEM. 

354
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,660
PERHAPS MOST NOTABLY, IN THE 

355

UNITED STATES VERSUS NIXON, 3 

356
00:16:05,864 --> 00:16:08,600

CASE JOINED THE UNANIMOUS 

358
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:15,074
OPINION AGAINST HIM. 

359
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,275
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN 

360
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,944
UNEQUIVOCAL IN HIS BELIEF THAT 

361
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,780
NO PRESIDENT IS ABOVE THE LAW. 

362
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,684
HE HAS STATED THAT MARYBURY VS

00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,863
4 GREATEST SUPREME COURT CASES 

367
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:38,831
IN HISTORY. 

368
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:44,803
WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON? 

369
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:46,038
EACH OF THEM IS A CASE WHERE 

370
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,673
CONGRESS SERVED AS A CHECK ON 

371
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,308
PRESIDENTIAL POWER. 

372
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:50,342
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT THE 

373
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,744
FOURTH CASE THAT JUDGE 

374
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:59,618
KAVANAUGH HAS POINTED TO AS THE 

375
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:00,486
GREATEST IN HISTORY WAS BROWN 

376
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:01,653
VERSUS THE BOARD OF 

377
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:07,157
EDUCATION.>>> ONE KAVANAUGH 

378
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:07,859
DECISION ILLUSTRATES THE POINT 

379
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,792
ABOUT THE CHECK ON PRESIDENTIAL 

380
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,060
POWER DIRECTLY, HE WROTE THE 

381
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,733
OPINION IN HAMDAN VS THE UNITED 

382
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:21,473
STATES, A CASE THAT CHALLENGES 

383
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,540
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S 

384
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,376
MILITARY PROSECUTION OF AN 

385
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,310
ASSOCIATE OF OSAMA BIN LADEN, 

386
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,014
THIS CONVICTION WAS VERY 

387
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,516
IMPORTANT TO THE BUSH 

388
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,049
ADMINISTRATION, BUT JUDGE 

389
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,686
KAVANAUGH, WHO HAD BEEN 

390
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,422
APPOINTED TO THE DC CIRCUIT BY 

391
00:17:37,422 --> 00:17:39,658
PRESIDENT BUSH, AND HAD WORKED

IN PRESIDENT BUSH'S WHITE HOUSE,

393
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:44,462
RULED THAT THE CONVICTION WAS 

394
00:17:44,462 --> 00:17:48,133
UNLAWFUL. 

395
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,568
AS HE EXPLAINED DURING THE 

396
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,870
HEARING, QUOTE, WE DON'T MAKE 

397

OR THE MOMENT, WE BASE 

400
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,546
DECISIONS ON THE LAW.

".>>> OTHERS I HAVE MET WITH 

402
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,155
HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS THAT 

403
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:11,223
JUSTICE KENNEDY'S RETIREMENT 

404
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:13,725
THREATENS THE RIGHT OF SAME-SEX 

405
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,594
COUPLES TO MARRY. 

406
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:19,998
YET JUDGE KAVANAUGH DESCRIBE THE

407
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,401
DECISION, WHICH LEGALIZED SAME 

408
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,103
GENDER MARRIAGES, AS AN 

409
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:29,174
IMPORTANT LANDMARK PRECEDENT. 

410

-- "THE DAYS OF TREATING GAY

OTHERS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE 

421
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:01,206
JUDGE HOLDS EXTREME VIEWS ON 

422
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,943
BIRTH CONTROL, IN ONE CASE, 

423
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:05,611
JUDGE KAVANAUGH INCURRED THE 

424
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,412
DISFAVOR OF BOTH SIDES OF THE 

425
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,281
POLITICAL SPECTRUM FOR SEEKING 

426
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,552
TO ENSURE THE AVAILABILITY OF 

427
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,519
CONTRACEPTIVE SERVICES FOR 

428
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,489
WOMEN, WHILE MINIMIZING THE 

429
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,291
INVOLVEMENT OF EMPLOYERS WITH 

430
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,926
RELIGIOUS OBJECTIONS. 

431
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,695
ALTHOUGH HIS CRITICS FREQUENTLY 

432
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,032
OVERLOOKED THIS POINT, JUDGE 

433
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:29,367
KAVANAUGH'S DISSENT REJECTED 

434
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,436
ARGUMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT 

435
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,872
DID NOT HAVE A COMPELLING 

436
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,975
INTEREST IN FACILITATING ACCESS 

437
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,645
TO CONTRACEPTION. 

438
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,346
IN FACT, HE WROTE THAT THE 

439
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:41,913
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT 

440
00:19:41,913 --> 00:19:43,448
STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT THERE 

441
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:47,852
WAS A COMPELLING INTEREST IN 

442
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:50,655
FACILITATING ACCESS TO BIRTH 

443
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,791
CONTROL.

444
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,661
>>> THERE HAS ALSO BEEN 

445
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,762
CONSIDERABLE FOCUS ON THE 

446
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,532
FUTURE OF ABORTION RIGHTS, 

447
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,700
BASED ON THE CONCERN THAT JUDGE 

448
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,905
KAVANAUGH WOULD SEEK TO OVERTURN

449
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,974
ROE VERSUS WADE, PROTECTING 

450
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:12,310
THIS RIGHT IS IMPORTANT TO ME. 

451
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:16,682
TO MY KNOWLEDGE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH

452
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,150
IS THE FIRST SUPREME COURT 

453
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,420
NOMINEE TO EXPRESS THE VIEW THAT

454
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,058
PRECEDENT IS NOT MERELY A 

455
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,592
PRACTICE AND TRADITION, BUT 

456
00:20:27,592 --> 00:20:32,531
ROOTED IN ARTICLE 3 OF OUR 

457
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:33,665
CONSTITUTION ITSELF. 

458
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,302
HE BELIEVES THAT PRECEDENT IS 

459
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:39,972
NOT JUST A JUDICIAL POLICY, IT 

460
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,107
IS CONSTITUTIONALLY DICTATED TO 

461
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:45,811
PAY ATTENTION AND PAY HEED TO 

462
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:47,713
RULES OF PRECEDENT. 

463
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:50,649
IN OTHER WORDS, PRECEDENT IS 

464
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,051
NOT A GOAL OR ASPIRATION, IT IS 

465
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:56,287
A CONSTITUTIONAL TENANT -- 10 

466
00:20:56,287 --> 00:21:03,395
THAT -- TENET THAT HAS TO BE 

467
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,863
FOLLOWED EXCEPT IN THE MOST 

468
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,231
EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES. 

469
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:10,702
AND PRECEDENT SUPPLIES 

470
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:11,636
PREDICTABILITY, RELIANCE AND 

471
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:12,137
FAIRNESS. 

472
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,340
THERE ARE OF COURSE RARE AND 

473
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,376
EXTRAORDINARY TIMES WHERE THE 

474
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,412
SUPREME COURT WOULD RIGHTLY 

475
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:22,447
OVERTURN A PRECEDENT, THE MOST 

476
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,585
FAMOUS EXAMPLE WAS WHEN THE 

477
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,418
SUPREME COURT IN BROWN VERSUS 

478
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:32,224
THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OVERRULED

479
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:37,462
PLESSEY VS FERGUSON, CORRECTING 

480
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,164
A GRIEVOUSLY WRONG DECISION, TO 

481
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,234
USE THE JUDGE'S TERM, ALLOWING 

482
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,535
RACIAL INEQUALITY.

483
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,905
>>> BUT SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES 

484
00:21:47,905 --> 00:21:49,107
THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF 

485
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,542
PRECEDENT HAS BEEN ROOTED IN 

486
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:55,981
THE CONSTITUTION WOULD FOLLOW 

487
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:56,581
LONG-ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT, 

488
00:21:56,581 --> 00:21:57,516
EXCEPT IN THOSE RARE 

489
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,484
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A DECISION 

490
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,588
IS PREVIOUSLY WRONG OR DEEPLY 

491
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,358
INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAW, 

492
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,593
THOSE ARE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 

493
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:10,962
PHRASES. 

494
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,132
AS THE JUDGE ASSERTED TO ME, A 

495
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,135
LONG-ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT IS 

496
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,070
NOT SOMETHING TO BE TRIMMED, 

497
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,972
NARROWED, DISCARDED, OR 

498
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:21,406
OVERLOOKED. 

499
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,642
ITS ROOTS IN THE CONSTITUTION 

500
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:38,456
GIVE THE CONCEPT OF STARE 

501
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:44,262
DECISIS, PRECLUDING ATTEMPTS TO 

502
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,297
DO BY STEALTH THAT WHICH ONE 

503
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:51,303
HAS COMMITTED NOT TO DO OVERLY. 

504
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,204
-- OVERTLY. 

505
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,107
NOTING THAT ROE VERSUS WADE WAS 

506
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:56,942
DECIDED 45 YEARS AGO, AND 

507
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:00,879
REAFFIRMED 19 YEARS LATER, IN 

508
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,579
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS 

509
00:23:01,579 --> 00:23:05,182
CASEY, I ASKED JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

510
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:06,884
WHETHER THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS 

511
00:23:06,884 --> 00:23:10,522
RELEVANT TO FOLLOWING PRECEDENT.

OF OUR LEGAL FRAMEWORK WITH THE 

514

PASSAGE OF TIME, AND THAT 

515
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:20,165
HONORING PRECEDENT IS ESSENTIAL 

516
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:21,232
TO MAINTAINING PUBLIC 

517
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:24,502
CONFIDENCE. 

518
00:23:24,502 --> 00:23:25,303
OUR DISCUSSION THEN TURNED TO 

519
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:27,439
THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY ON WHICH 

520
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:32,910
THE SUPREME COURT RELIED IN 

521
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:38,884
GRISWALD VS CONNECTICUT, A CASE 

522
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:39,918
THAT STRUCK DOWN A LAW BANNING 

523
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,855
THE USE OF CONTRACEPTION. 

524
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:44,589
IT ESTABLISHED THE LEGAL 

525
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,423
FOUNDATION THAT LED TO ROE 

526
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,659
VERSUS WADE EIGHT YEARS LATER. 

527
00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,694
IN DESCRIBING GRISWOLD AS 

528
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:53,431
SETTLED LAW, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

529
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,500
OBSERVED THAT IT WAS THE 

530
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,470
CORRECT APPLICATION OF TWO 

531
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,506
FAMOUS CASES FROM THE 1920S. 

532
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:06,211
MEYER AND PIERCE, THAT ARE NOT 

533
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,445
SERIOUSLY CHALLENGED BY ANYONE 

534
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:10,015
TODAY.

535
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:10,882
>>> FINALLY, IN HIS TESTIMONY 

536
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,450
HE NOTED REPEATEDLY THAT ROE 

537
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,722
VERSUS WADE HAD BEEN UPHELD BY 

538
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:18,322
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS 

539
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:18,924
CASEY, DESCRIBING IT AS 

540
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,227
PRECEDENT ON PRECEDENT. 

541
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,928
WHEN I ASKED HIM, WOULD IT BE 

542
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:26,531
SUFFICIENT TO OVERTURN A LONG-

543
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,802
ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT IF 5 

544
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:35,140
CURRENT JUSTICES BELIEVED THAT 

545
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:35,774
IT WAS WRONGLY DECIDED, HE 

546
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:40,445

583
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,512

NOT JUDGE KAVANAUGH COMMITTED 

655

TO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

657
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,545
SOME ARGUE THAT BECAUSE THIS IS 

658
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:45,083
A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT, TO OUR 

659
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:50,855
HIGHEST COURTS, THE REQUIREMENT 

660
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:52,156
IS TO RESOLVE AGAINST THE 

661

662
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,361

INNOCENCE. 

668

IN CASES IN WHICH THE FACTS ARE 

669
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:12,143
UNCLEAR, THEY WOULD ARGUE THAT 

670
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:12,844
THE QUESTIONS SHOULD BE 

671
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:14,178
RESOLVED IN FAVOR OF THE

BOTH VIEWPOINTS, THIS DEBATE IS 

675
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,188
COMPLICATED FURTHER BY THE FACT 

676
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:26,657
THAT THE SENATE CONFIRMATION 

677
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,928
PROCESS IS NOT A TRIAL, BUT 

678
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:32,030
CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL LEGAL 

679
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,466
PRINCIPLES ABOUT DUE PROCESS, 

680
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:38,970
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, 

681
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,872
AND FAIRNESS, DO BEAR ON MY 

682
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:50,048
THINKING, AND I CANNOT ABANDON 

683
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:50,481
THEM. 

684
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,883
IN EVALUATING ANY GIVEN CLAIM 

685
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,251
OF MISCONDUCT, WE WILL BE EEL 

686
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:56,453
SERVED IN THE LONG RUN IF WE 

687
00:30:56,453 --> 00:30:59,490
ABANDON THE PRESUMPTION OF 

688
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,860
INNOCENCE AND FAIRNESS, 

689
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,963
TEMPTING THOUGH IT MAY BE. 

690
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:08,399
WE MUST ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT IT 

691
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,035
IS WHEN PASSIONS ARE MOST 

692
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:15,640
INFLAMED, THAT FAIRNESS IS MOST 

693
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,776
IN JEOPARDY.

694
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:23,481
>>> THE PRESUMPTION OF 

695
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:24,349
INNOCENCE IS RELEVANT TO THE 

696
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:25,016
ADVICE AND CONSENT FUNCTION 

697
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:28,119
WHEN AN ACCUSATION DEPARTS FROM 

698
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,954
A NOMINEES OTHERWISE EXEMPLARY 

699
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:32,590
RECORD. 

700
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,760
I WORRY THAT DEPARTING FROM 

701
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,163
THIS PRESUMPTION COULD LEAD TO 

702
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,031
A LACK OF PUBLIC FAITH IN THE 

703
00:31:41,031 --> 00:31:46,503
JUDICIARY, AND WOULD BE HUGELY 

704
00:31:46,503 --> 00:31:47,271
DAMAGING TO THE CONFIRMATION 

705
00:31:47,271 --> 00:31:50,141
PROCESS MOVING FORWARD. 

706
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,576
SOME OF THE ALLEGATIONS LEVIED 

707
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,609
AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

708
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:55,213
ILLUSTRATE WHY THE PRESUMPTION 

709
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:59,751
OF INNOCENCE IS SO IMPORTANT. 

710
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,452
I AM THINKING IN PARTICULAR NOT 

711
00:32:01,452 --> 00:32:05,523
AT THE ALLEGATIONS RAISED BY 

712
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,692
PROFESSOR FORD, BUT OF THE 

713
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,227
ALLEGATION THAT WHEN HE WAS A 

714
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,829
TEENAGER, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

715
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:14,766
DRUGGED MULTIPLE GIRLS, AND 

716
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,100
USED THEIR WEEKEND ESTATE TO 

717
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:21,439
FACILITATE GANG RAPE. 

718
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:27,311
-- WEAKENED STATE TO FACILITATE 

719
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:28,146
GANG RAPE. 

720
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,448
THIS OUTLANDISH ASSERTION CAME 

721
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,950
WITHOUT EVIDENCE, AND SIMPLY 

722
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,118
PARROTED PUBLIC STATEMENTS OF 

723
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:34,852
OTHERS. 

724
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,554
THAT SUCH AN ALLEGATION CAN 

725
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:40,658
FIND ITS WAY INTO THE SUPREME 

726
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,161
COURT CONFIRMATION PROCESS IS A 

727
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:46,197
STARK REMINDER ABOUT WHY THE 

728
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,466
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IS SO 

729
00:32:49,466 --> 00:32:53,471
INGRAINED IN OUR AMERICAN 

730
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,540
CONSCIOUSNESS.

731
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,143
>>> ESTHER PRESIDENT, I 

732
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:02,780
LISTENED CAREFULLY TO CHRISTINE 

733
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,081
BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY BEFORE 

734
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:07,151
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 

735
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,220
I FOUND HER TESTIMONY TO BE 

736
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:13,657
SINCERE, PAINFUL, AND 

737
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:16,160
COMPELLING. 

738
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,164
I BELIEVE THAT SHE IS A SURVIVOR

739
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,768
OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND THAT 

740
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:26,236
THIS TRAUMA HAS UPENDED HER 

741
00:33:26,236 --> 00:33:29,240
LIFE. 

742
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,576
NEVERTHELESS, THE FOUR 

743
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,443
WITNESSES SHE NAMED COULD NOT 

744
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:37,581
CORROBORATE ANY OF THE EVENTS 

745
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:40,351
OF THAT EVENING GATHERING WHERE 

746
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,989
SHE SAYS THE ASSAULT OCCURRED. 

747
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,558
NONE OF THE INDIVIDUALS 

748
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:49,092
PROFESSOR FORD SAYS WERE AT THE 

749
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:52,196
PARTY HAS ANY RECOLLECTION AT 

750
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:56,601
ALL OF THAT NIGHT. 

751
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,304
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FORCEFULLY 

752
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:01,139
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS UNDER 

753
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,409
PENALTY OF PERJURY. 

754
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:09,914
MARK JUDGE DENIED UNDER PENALTY 

755
00:34:09,914 --> 00:34:11,549
OF FELONY THAT HE HAD WITNESSED 

756
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,550
AN ASSAULT. 

757
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,953
PJ SMITH, ANOTHER PERSON 

758
00:34:15,953 --> 00:34:18,222
ALLEGEDLY AT THE PARTY, DENIED 

759
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,391
THAT HE WAS THERE. 

760
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,561
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY. 

761
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,864
PROFESSOR FORD'S LIFELONG FRIEND

762
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:33,271
, LELAND KAISER, INDICATED THAT 

763
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,239
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY, SHE 

764
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,873
DOES NOT REMEMBER THAT PARTY. 

765
00:34:36,873 --> 00:34:40,511
AND SHE WENT FURTHER, SHE 

766
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:41,946
INDICATED THAT NOT ONLY DOES 

767
00:34:41,946 --> 00:34:43,414
SHE NOT REMEMBER A NIGHT LIKE 

768
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,850
THAT, BUT ALSO THAT SHE DOES 

769
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:53,925
NOT EVEN KNOW BRETT KAVANAUGH.

770
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,693
>>> IN ADDITION TO THE LACK OF 

771
00:34:55,693 --> 00:34:57,328
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE, WE ALSO 

772
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:58,396
LEARNED SOME FACTS THAT RAISE 

773
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,332
MORE QUESTIONS, FOR INSTANCE, 

774
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:02,667
SINCE THESE ALLEGATIONS HAVE 

775
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:06,003
BECOME PUBLIC, PROFESSOR FORD 

776
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:07,705
TESTIFIED THAT NOT A SINGLE 

777
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:11,976
PERSON HAS CONTACTED HER TO SAY 

778
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:20,051
I WAS AT THE PARTY THAT NIGHT. 

779
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:20,618
FURTHERMORE, THE PROFESSOR 

780
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,285
TESTIFIED THAT ALTHOUGH SHE 

781
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,286
DOES NOT REMEMBER HOW SHE GOT 

782
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,589
HOME THAT EVENING, SHE KNEW THAT

783
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,125
BECAUSE OF THE DISTANCE, SHE 

784
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:31,229
WOULD HAVE NEEDED A RIDE, YET 

785
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:32,296
NOT A SINGLE PERSON HAS COME 

786
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,432
FORWARD TO SAY THAT THEY WERE 

787
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:38,836
THE ONE WHO DROVE HER HOME, OR 

788
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,504
WERE IN THE CAR WITH HER THAT 

789
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,206
NIGHT. 

790
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:43,441
AND PROFESSOR FORD ALSO 

791
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:48,412
INDICATED THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE 

792
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,347
LEFT THAT SMALL GATHERING OF 

793
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,416
SIX OR SO PEOPLE ABRUPTLY AND 

794
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,785
WITHOUT SAYING GOODBYE, AND 

795
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:58,522
DISTRAUGHT, NONE OF THEM CALLED 

796
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:01,993
HER THE NEXT DAY, OR EVER, TO 

797
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,630
ASK WHY SHE LEFT, IS SHE OKAY. 

798
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:09,133
NOT EVEN HER CLOSEST FRIEND, 

799
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:11,268
MS. KAISER. 

800
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:16,440
>>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE 

801
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,275
CONSTITUTION DOES NOT PROVIDE 

802
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,141
GUIDANCE ON HOW WE ARE SUPPOSED 

803
00:36:18,141 --> 00:36:19,409
TO EVALUATE THESE COMPETING 

804
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,812
CLAIMS, IT LEAVES THAT DECISION 

805
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:26,917
UP TO EACH SENATOR. THIS IS NOT 

806
00:36:26,917 --> 00:36:29,654
A CRIMINAL TRIAL, AND I DO NOT 

807
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:34,292
BELIEVE THAT THE CRIMINAL TRIAL

808
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,493
, AND I DON'T THINK THAT THE 

809
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:36,794
CLAIMS NEED TO BE PROVED BEYOND 

810
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,261
A REASONABLE DOUBT, 

811
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,295
NEVERTHELESS, FAIRNESS WOULD 

812
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:40,865
DICTATE THAT THE CLAIMS AT 

813
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:45,002
LEAST SHOULD MEET A THRESHOLD 

814
00:36:45,002 --> 00:36:49,373
OF MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. 

815
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,808
AS OUR STANDARD. 

816
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:54,779
THE FACTS PRESENTED DO NOT MEAN 

817
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:59,216
THAT PROFESSOR FORD WAS NOT 

818
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:01,886
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED THAT NIGHT, 

819
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,889
OR AT SOME OTHER TIME. 

820
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,959
BUT THEY DO LEAD ME TO CONCLUDE 

821
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,693
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS FAILED TO 

822
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:12,796
MEET THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT 

823
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:17,634
STANDARD. THEREFORE, I DO NOT 

824
00:37:17,634 --> 00:37:20,771
BELIEVE THAT THESE CHARGES CAN 

825
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:24,307
FAIRLY PREVENT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 

826
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:27,378
FROM SERVING ON THE COURT.

827
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:31,015
>>> LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT MY 

828
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:32,283
APPROACH TO THIS QUESTION 

829
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,820
SHOULD NOT BE MISCONSTRUED AS 

830
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,256
SUGGESTING THAT UNWANTED SEXUAL 

831
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:41,425
CONTACT OF ANY NATURE IS NOT A 

832
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,495
SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY.

833
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:52,036
TO THE CONTRARY, IF ANY GOOD AT 

834
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:53,537
ALL HAS COME FROM THIS UGLY 

835
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:54,204
CONFIRMATION PROCESS, IT HAS 

836
00:37:54,204 --> 00:37:56,707
BEEN TO CREATE AN AWARENESS 

837
00:37:56,707 --> 00:38:00,911
THAT WE HAVE UNDERESTIMATED THE 

838
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,580
PERVASIVENESS OF THIS TERRIBLE 

839
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,916
PROBLEM. 

840
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:10,955
I HAVE BEEN ALARMED AND 

841
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,289
DISTURBED, HOWEVER, BY SOME WHO 

842
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,559
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT UNLESS 

843
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:16,693
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION IS 

844
00:38:16,693 --> 00:38:19,697
REJECTED, THE SENATE IS SOMEHOW 

845
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,800
CONDONING SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

846
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,735
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 

847
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:28,439
THE TRUTH. 

848
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:32,376
EVERY PERSON, MAN OR WOMAN, WHO 

849
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:34,011
MAKES A CHARGE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT

850
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,680
DESERVES TO BE HEARD AND 

851
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,183
TREATED WITH RESPECT. 

852
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,821
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IS REAL. 

853
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,123
IT MATTERS. 

854
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,859
IT IS NEEDED, AND IT IS LONG 

855
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:53,564
OVERDUE. 

856
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:54,598
WE KNOW THAT RAPE AND SEXUAL 

857
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,700
ASSAULT ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE 

858
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:05,743
REPORTED TO THE POLICE, AN 

859
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:06,510
ESTIMATED 211,000 RAPES AND 

860
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,711
SEXUAL ASSAULTS GO UNREPORTED 

861
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,548
EVERY YEAR. 

862
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,683
WE MUST LISTEN TO SURVIVORS, 

863
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,852
AND EVERY DAY WE MUST SEEK TO 

864
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,955
STOP THE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR THAT 

865
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:21,892
HAS HURT SO MANY. 

866
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:23,527
WE OWE THIS TO OURSELVES, OUR 

867
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,129
CHILDREN, AND GENERATIONS TO 

868
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,797
COME.

869
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:30,534
>>> SINCE THE HEARING, I HAVE 

870
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,672
LISTENED TO MANY SURVIVORS OF 

871
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:36,674
SEXUAL ASSAULT. 

872
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:38,809
MANY WERE TOTAL STRANGERS, WHO 

873
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,245
TOLD ME THEIR HEART WRENCHING 

874
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:47,685
STORIES, FOR THE FIRST TIME, 

875
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,219
SOME WERE FRIENDS THAT I HAVE 

876
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:59,830
KNOWN, AND I HAD NO IDEA, THAT 

877
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,233
THEY HAD BEEN THE VICTIM OF 

878
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,069
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ATTACKS. 

879
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:09,573
I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEIR COURAGE,

880
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,411
AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO COME 

881
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,714
FORWARD, AND I HOPE THAT IN 

882
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,249
HEIGHTENING PUBLIC AWARENESS, 

883
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,617
THEY HAVE ALSO LIGHTENED THE 

884
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,119
BURDEN THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 

885
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,489
QUIETLY BEARING FOR SO MANY 

886
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:26,757
YEARS. 

887
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,627
TO THEM, I PLEDGE TO DO ALL 

888
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:33,230
THAT I CAN TO ENSURE THAT THEIR 

889
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,433
DAUGHTERS, AND GRANDDAUGHTERS, 

890
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:41,205
NEVER SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES.

891
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:49,447
>>> OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS, I 

892
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,247
HAVE BEEN EMPHATIC THAT THE 

893
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,682
SENATE HAS AN OBLIGATION TO 

894
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:56,787
INVESTIGATE AND EVALUATE THE 

895
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,454
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL 

896
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:58,389
ASSAULT, I CALLED FOR AND 

897
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:58,922
SUPPORTED THE ADDITIONAL 

898
00:40:58,922 --> 00:41:00,457
HEARING TO HEAR FROM BOTH 

899
00:41:00,457 --> 00:41:02,259
PROFESSOR FORD AND JUDGE 

900
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:05,396
KAVANAUGH. I ALSO PUSHED 

901
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:09,700
FORWARD AND SUPPORTED THE FBI'S 

902
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,667
SUPPLEMENTAL BACKGROUND 

903
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:13,037
INVESTIGATION. 

904
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:17,074
THIS WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. 

905
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,943
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD NEVER 

906
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:22,880
SOUGHT THE SPOTLIGHT, SHE 

907
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,581
INDICATED THAT SHE WAS 

908
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:29,420
TERRIFIED TO APPEAR BEFORE THE 

909
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,120
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, AND 

910
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,988
SHE HAS SHUNNED ATTENTION SINCE 

911
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:31,755
THEN. 

912
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:37,061
SHE SEEMED UNAWARE OF CHAIRMAN 

913
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,663
GRASSLEY'S OFFER TO ALLOW HER 

914
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:44,234
TO TESTIFY CONFIDENTIALITY -- 

915
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:49,006
CONFIDENTIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. 

916
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:49,873
WATCHING HER, MR. PRESIDENT, I 

917
00:41:49,873 --> 00:41:51,675
COULD NOT HELP BUT FEEL THAT 

918
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,810
SOME PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO 

919
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,546
ENGINEER THE DEFEAT OF THIS 

920
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:59,917
NOMINATION CARED LITTLE, IF AT 

921
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:06,957
ALL, ABOUT HER WELL-BEING. 

922
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:11,362
PROFESSOR FORD TESTIFIED THAT A 

923
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,329
VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE 

924
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:14,331
HAD ACCESS TO HER LETTER. 

925
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,601
YET THAT LETTER FOUND ITS WAY 

926
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:22,172
INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN. 

927
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,040
SHE TESTIFIED THAT SHE NEVER 

928
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,907
GAVE PERMISSION FOR THAT VERY 

929
00:42:23,907 --> 00:42:27,011
PRIVATE LETTER, TO BE RELEASED. 

930
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:30,047
AND YET, HERE WE ARE. 

931
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,115
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT 

932
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:36,453
THAT SHE NEVER SOUGHT, ARGUING 

933
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:38,088
ABOUT CLAIMS THAT SHE WANTED TO 

934
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,424
RAISE CONFIDENTIALLY. 

935
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:41,525
NOW ONE THEORY I HAVE HEARD 

936
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,792
ESPOUSED REPEATEDLY IS THAT OUR 

937
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:45,663
COLLEAGUE, SENATOR DIANNE 

938
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,497
FEINSTEIN, LEAKED PROFESSOR 

939
00:42:47,497 --> 00:42:49,033
FORD'S LETTER AT THE 11th HOUR 

940
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:51,969
TO DERAIL THIS PROCESS. 

941
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,470
I WANT TO STATE THIS VERY 

942
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,641
CLEARLY, I KNOW SENATOR DIANNE 

943
00:42:57,641 --> 00:43:00,010
FEINSTEIN EXTREMELY WELL. 

944
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,113
AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE WOULD 

945
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:08,852
NEVER DO THAT. 

946
00:43:08,852 --> 00:43:09,987
I KNEW THAT TO BE THE CASE 

947
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,188
BEFORE SHE EVEN STATED IT AT 

948
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,723
THE HEARING, A PERSON OF 

949
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:16,960
INTEGRITY, AND I STAND BY HER. 

950
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,663
I HAVE ALSO HEARD SOME ARGUE 

951
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,032
THAT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 

952
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:27,171
COMMITTEE SOMEHOW TREATED 

953
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:27,704
PROFESSOR FORD UNFAIRLY. 

954
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:29,139
NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM 

955
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,507
THE TRUTH. 

956
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,509
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, ALONG WITH 

957
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,512
HIS EXCELLENT STAFF, TREATED 

958
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,915
PROFESSOR FORD WITH COMPASSION 

959
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,484
AND RESPECT THROUGHOUT THE 

960
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,319
ENTIRE PROCESS. 

961
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,090
AND THAT IS THE WAY THE SENATOR 

962
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,658
FROM IOWA HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF 

963
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:51,228
THROUGHOUT A LIFETIME DEDICATED 

964
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:53,397
TO PUBLIC SERVICE.

965
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:58,335
>>> BUT THE FACT REMAINS, MR. 

966
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,903
PRESIDENT, SOMEONE LEAKED THIS 

967
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,540
LETTER AGAINST PROFESSOR FORD'S 

968
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,210
EXPRESSED WISHES. 

969
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:08,846
I SUSPECT, REGRETTABLY, THAT WE 

970
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:10,414
WILL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN WHO 

971
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,916
DID IT. 

972
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,086
TO THAT LEAKER, WHO I HOPE IS 

973
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,388
LISTENING NOW, LET ME SAY THAT 

974
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:24,662
WHAT YOU DID WAS UNCONSCIONABLE.

975
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:28,599
YOU HAVE TAKEN A SURVIVOR, WHO 

976
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,133
WAS NOT ONLY ENTITLED TO YOUR 

977
00:44:30,133 --> 00:44:33,236
RESPECT, BUT WHO ALSO TRUSTED 

978
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:37,674
YOU TO PROTECT HER, AND YOU 

979
00:44:37,674 --> 00:44:39,877
HAVE SACRIFICED HER WELL-BEING 

980
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:43,413
IN A MISGUIDED ATTEMPT TO WIN 

981
00:44:43,413 --> 00:44:46,749
WHATEVER POLITICAL CRUSADE YOU 

982
00:44:46,749 --> 00:44:50,387
THINK YOU ARE FIGHTING. 

983
00:44:50,387 --> 00:44:53,724
MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT YOUR 

984
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:56,393
CALLOUS ACT HAS TURNED THIS 

985
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:59,863
PROCESS INTO SUCH A 

986
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,597
DYSFUNCTIONAL CIRCUS THAT IT 

987
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,167
WILL CAUSE THE SENATE, AND 

988
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,834
INDEED ALL AMERICANS, TO 

989
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:07,671
RECONSIDER HOW WE EVALUATE 

990
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:11,275
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. 

991
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:15,145
IF THAT HAPPENS, THEN THE 

992
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:16,747
APPALLING LACK OF COMPASSION 

993
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,616
YOU AFFORDED PROFESSOR FORD, 

994
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,318
WILL AT LEAST HAVE SOME 

995
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,287
UNINTENDED POSITIVE 

996
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:28,358
CONSEQUENCES.

997
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,294
>>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE 

998
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,396
POLITICALLY CHARGED ATMOSPHERE 

999
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,667
SURROUNDING THIS NOMINATION HAS 

1000
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,469
REACHED THE FEVER PITCH EVEN 

1001
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:40,604
BEFORE THESE ALLEGATIONS WERE 

1002
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:42,673
KNOWN, AND IT HAS BEEN 

1003
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:45,041
CHALLENGING, EVEN THEN, TWO 

1004
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:49,379
SEPARATE FACT FROM FICTION. 

1005
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:54,785
WE LIVE IN A TIME OF SUCH GREAT 

1006
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:58,288
DISUNITY, AS THE BITTER FIGHT 

1007
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:58,989
OVER THIS NOMINATION, BOTH IN 

1008
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:00,691
THE SENATE AND AMONG THE PUBLIC

1009
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,460
, CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES. 

1010
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,830
IT IS NOT MERELY A CASE OF 

1011
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,799
DIFFERING GROUPS HAVING 

1012
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:11,235
DIFFERENT OPINIONS, IT IS A 

1013
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:14,705
CASE OF PEOPLE BEARING EXTREME 

1014
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:17,374
ILL WILL TOWARD THOSE WHO 

1015
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:21,345
DISAGREE WITH THEM. 

1016
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,713
IN OUR INTENSE FOCUS ON OUR 

1017
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,948
DIFFERENCES, WE HAVE FORGOTTEN 

1018
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:30,787
THE COMMON VALUES THAT BIND US 

1019
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,891
TOGETHER AS AMERICANS. 

1020
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:36,360
WHEN SOME OF OUR BEST MINDS, 

1021
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,728
ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP EVEN 

1022
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:42,833
MORE SOPHISTICATED ALGORITHMS 

1023
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:43,699
DESIGNED TO LINK US TO WEBSITES 

1024
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:47,304
THAT ONLY REINFORCE AND CATER 

1025
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:51,742
TO OUR VIEWS, WE CAN ONLY EXPECT

1026
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:57,414
OUR DIFFERENCES TO INTENSIFY.

1027
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,650
>>> THIS WOULD HAVE ALARMED THE 

1028
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,885
DRAFTERS OF OUR CONSTITUTION, 

1029
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,988

1032
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:14,964
BECOMING AN REMAINING -- AND 

1033
00:47:14,964 --> 00:47:19,803
REMAINING THE PEOPLE, THE SIX 

1034
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,204
OBJECTIVES IN THE PREAMBLE TO 

1035
00:47:21,204 --> 00:47:22,339
THE CONSTITUTION, THE ONE THAT 

1036
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,707
THEY PUT FIRST, WAS THE 

1037
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:27,710
FORMATION OF A MORE PERFECT 

1038
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:31,481
UNION.

THEIR VISION OF A MORE PERFECT 

1040
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:39,022
UNION DOES NOT EXIST TODAY. 

1041
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,057
AND IF ANYTHING, WE APPEAR TO 

1042
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,458
BE MOVING FARTHER AWAY FROM 

1043
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,261
THAT. 

1044
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:46,096
IT IS PARTICULARLY WORRISOME 

1045
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:50,233
THAT THE SUPREME COURT, THE 

1046
00:47:50,233 --> 00:47:51,868
INSTITUTION THAT MOST AMERICANS 

1047
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,504
SEE AS THE PRINCIPAL GUARDIAN 

1048
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:57,975
OF OUR SHARED CONSTITUTIONAL 

1049
00:47:57,975 --> 00:48:02,145
HERITAGE, IS VIEWED AS PART OF 

1050
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:04,213
THE PROBLEM THROUGH A POLITICAL 

1051
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:07,651
LENS. 

1052
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:11,888
MR. PRESIDENT, WE HAVE HEARD A 

1053
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,358
LOT OF CHARGES AND COUNTER 

1054
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,463
CHARGES ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 

1055
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,198
BUT AS THOSE WHO HAVE KNOWN HIM 

1056
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:27,504
BEST HAVE ATTESTED, HE HAS BEEN 

1057
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:30,407
AN EXEMPLARY PUBLIC SERVANT, 

1058
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,076
JUDGE, TEACHER, COACH, HUSBAND, 

1059

TO LESSEN THE DIVISIONS IN THE 

1065

1066
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:58,502
FAR FEWER 5-4 DECISIONS, AND SO 

1067
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:02,205

COLLINS, SHE MADE A COMMITMENT 

1165
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,479

00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,296

OUT WHAT WAS SAID AND MOVE FROM 

1274

THERE. 

1275
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,681
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER TALKING 

1276
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:33,716
AT THIS POINT, BUT AFTER THE 

1277
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:36,686
VOTE, IT IS EASIER TO TELL.

1278
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:45,461
>>> WE HAVE SENATOR JOE 

1279
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:47,831
MANCHIN. 

1280
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,282
>>> WE WANTED TO  

1281
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:10,253
>> GREAT CONCERN FOR THE PEOPLE 

1282
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:10,620
HERE? 

1283
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:10,954
>> SURE. 

1284
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,055
I'M VERY CONCERNED WITH THE 

1285
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,289
SEXUAL ABUSE THAT PEOPLE HAD TO 

1286
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:16,292
ENDURE, AND VERY MUCH CONCERNED 

1287
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:18,027
THAT WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING AS 

1288
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:21,431
A COUNTRY. 

1289
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,699
>> WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO BE 

1290
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:24,667
THE -- VOTE FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH?

1291
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:31,174
>> I JUST, YOU KNOW, I NEVER 

1292
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,141
THOUGHT OF IT BASED ON 50-50, 

1293
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,277
50-52, WHATEVER IT WAS. 

1294
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:35,278
IF I'D HAVE BEEN IN THAT 

1295
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,213
POSITION, I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO 

1296
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:43,386
SEE THE PROCEDURE. 

1297
00:58:43,386 --> 00:58:44,654
>> BUT, WHY DID YOU WAIT FOR 

1298
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:45,388
COLLINS TO MAKE HER 

1299
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,623
ANNOUNCEMENT BEFORE YOU MADE 

1300
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:48,625
YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT? 

1301
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,759
>> I THINK THAT WAS BASICALLY 

1302
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:54,230
WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO SAY. 

1303
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:55,564
>> BUT DID YOU -- DECIDE TO GO 

1304
00:58:55,564 --> 00:58:56,566
THAT WAY? 

1305
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:59,235
>> OH, NO. 

1306
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,136
I THINK EVERYONE LABORED WITH 

1307
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:00,303
IT. 

1308
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:01,571
I THINK EVERYBODY LABORED WITH 

1309
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:02,872
IT. 

1310
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,375
AND, WE HAD BEEN -- ALL MORNING 

1311
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:05,575
LONG. 

1312
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:06,776
EVERYTHING. 

1313
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:13,416
>> HOW DOES SENATOR MURKOWSKI 

1314
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:14,350
VOTING  CHANGE YOUR DECISIO? 

1315
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:18,655
>> SENATOR MURKOWSKI  IS A 

1316
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,722
VERY, VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. 

1317
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,358
VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. 

1318
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:22,992
AND, SHE DID EVERYTHING, 

1319
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:30,900
CROSSED A VERY -- CROSSED EVERY 

1320
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:31,601
"T," DOTTED EVERY "I." 

1321
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:42,211
ALL OF US WENT THROUGH THE SAME 

1322
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:43,045
PROCESS AND CAME TO DIFFERENT 

1323
00:59:43,045 --> 00:59:43,379
CONCLUSIONS. 

1324
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,380
>> DO YOU BELIEVE DR. FORD? 

1325
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:45,281
>> I BELIEVE DR. FORD. 

1326
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:45,714
SOMETHING HAPPENED. 

1327
00:59:45,714 --> 00:59:46,582
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE FACTS 

1328
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:47,483
SHOW THAT IT WAS BRETT 

1329
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:48,016
KAVANAUGH, BUT I BELIEVE 

1330
00:59:48,016 --> 00:59:48,450
SOMETHING HAPPENED. 

1331
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:49,585
>> DO YOU BELIEVE SOMEBODY ELSE 

1332
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:50,486
DID IT? 

1333
00:59:50,486 --> 00:59:54,190
>> I THINK SOMETHING HAPPENED 

1334
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:54,423
TO HER. 

1335
00:59:54,423 --> 00:59:55,625
>> WHAT YOU SAY TO WOMEN WHO 

1336
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:56,692
WATCH THIS PROCESS UNFOLD? 

1337
00:59:56,692 --> 00:59:58,861
HEARD DR. FORD'S STORY? 

1338
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:00,296
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE STEPPED 

1339
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:04,500
FORWARD? 

1340
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,234
AND THAT, THE SENATE IS 

1341
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:05,601
ESSENTIALLY -- 

1342
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:06,469
>> I'VE HAD PEOPLE ALL OVER 

1343
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:10,573
WEST VIRGINIA COME FORWARD. 

1344
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,207
JUST BASICALLY, THE HURT THAT 

1345
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:12,075
PEOPLE HAVE, THE TRAUMA THEY 

1346
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:12,508
HAVE GONE THROUGH. 

1347
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:17,447
AND, I DON'T KNOW. 

1348
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,581
I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO 

1349
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,617
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE HEARD. 

1350
01:00:21,617 --> 01:00:25,955
>> IS THIS AN ADEQUATE FBI 

1351
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:26,489
INVESTIGATION? 

1352
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:27,724
>> I CAN ONLY HAVE WHAT'S IN 

1353
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:28,257
FRONT OF ME. 

1354
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:29,758
THAT'S ALL I HAVE IN FRONT OF 

1355
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:31,861
ME. 

1356
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:32,996
>> DO YOU BELIEVE THAT -- FOR 

1357
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:33,329
THE FBI? 

1358
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:41,537
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS THAT? 

1359
01:00:41,537 --> 01:00:42,605
>> DO YOU THINK THAT THERE 

1360
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:43,506
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE 

1361
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:43,806
WITNESSES? 

1362
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:44,807
>> I THINK THERE IS ALWAYS MORE 

1363
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:45,541
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE. 

1364
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,675
I LOOKED AT WHAT WAS IN FRONT 

1365
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:48,544
OF ME AND I HAD TO MAKE THE 

1366
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:48,944
DECISION. 

1367
01:00:48,944 --> 01:00:50,279
>> BASED ON THAT, WAS IT AN 

1368
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:50,646
INVESTIGATION? 

1369
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:51,514
>> FROM WHAT I SAW, THE PEOPLE 

1370
01:00:51,514 --> 01:00:53,182
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT AND WHAT 

1371
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:58,888
THEY SAID WHAT THEY SAID. 

1372
01:00:58,888 --> 01:01:00,256
>> DO YOU THINK THERE IS STILL 

1373
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:01,090
PLACE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 

1374
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:01,423
AFTER THIS? 

1375
01:01:01,423 --> 01:01:02,091
>> I DON'T KNOW. 

1376
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,626
I'M JUST A GOOD OLD WEST 

1377
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,560
VIRGINIAN. 

1378
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:12,001
>> BUT YOU ARE LOOKING AT 

1379
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:12,368
DEBATES -- 

1380
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:13,870
>> I DID NOT LOOK AT THIS FROM 

1381
01:01:13,870 --> 01:01:14,437
A POLITICAL STANDPOINT. 

1382
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,071
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED WITH 

1383
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:15,972
KAVANAUGH'S TEMPERAMENT AT ALL? 

1384
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:16,605
I KNOW SOME ARE CONCERNED. 

1385
01:01:16,605 --> 01:01:17,373
>> THURSDAY BOTHERED ME. 

1386
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,107
THURSDAY BOTHERED ME A LOT. 

1387
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,175
BUT, I SAW BASICALLY A 

1388
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:19,976
DIFFERENT SIDE. 

1389
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:23,680
>> 

1390
01:01:32,822 --> 01:01:36,558
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, EXPLAINING 

1391
01:01:36,558 --> 01:01:37,593
WHY HE CHOSE TO CROSS PARTY 

1392
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:42,398
LINES, AND WILL BE VOTING "YES" 

1393
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:42,965
ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 

1394
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,000
HE SAID, WHEN ASKED IF YOU 

1395
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,633
BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD 

1396
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:45,968
VOTE FOR HIM,  HE SAID, I'M 

1397
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:48,237
JUST A WEST VIRGINIAN. 

1398
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:49,372
MOLLY, I'M SURE YOU COULD HEAR 

1399
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:52,241
THAT, IT WAS HARD TO HEAR 

1400
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,777
MANCHIN BECAUSE YOU COULD HEAR 

1401
01:01:54,777 --> 01:02:01,484
PROTESTERS  SAYING "SHAME, 

1402
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:02,185
SHAME, SHAME," COMPLETELY 

1403
01:02:02,185 --> 01:02:02,885
OVERPOWERING MOST OF WHAT WE 

1404
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:03,218
COULD HEAR. 

1405
01:02:03,218 --> 01:02:04,253
I WANT TO BRING IN CAPITAL 

1406
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,221
REPORTER FOR "THE HILL," MOLLY 

1407
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:05,922
HOOPER. 

1408
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:06,556
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE COULD 

1409
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,392
HEAR FROM SENATOR MANCHIN? 

1410
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:10,560
>> A FEW THINGS WERE GOING ON 

1411
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:10,793
HERE. 

1412
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:15,731
NUMBER ONE,  HEARING THOSE 

1413
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:16,699
PROTESTERS IN THE BACKGROUND, 

1414
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:17,333
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SENATORS 

1415
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:18,301
HAVE BEEN FACING FOR THE PAST 

1416
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:19,202
TWO WEEKS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN 

1417
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,971
FACING A DAILY. 

1418
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,039
IN FACT, I'VE COVERED CAPITOL 

1419
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,807
HILL FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. 

1420
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:25,274
AS YOU KNOW. 

1421
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:30,780
AND, I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT QUITE 

1422
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:35,518
SO -- THE AGGRESSIVE NATURE OF 

1423
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:36,319
THE PROTESTERS, REALLY GETTING 

1424
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,988
IN THE FACE OF SENATORS AND 

1425
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,056
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, TO THE 

1426
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:40,790
POINT WHERE CAPITOL POLICE ARE 

1427
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:47,163
AROUND ON HAND SO THAT A 

1428
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:47,997
SENATOR CAN SAY, YES, THIS 

1429
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:48,931
PERSON IS IMPEDING THE ABILITY 

1430
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,999
FOR ME TO DO MY JOB. 

1431
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:52,502
THAT'S ONE THING. 

1432
01:02:52,502 --> 01:03:00,776
NUMBER TWO, TALKING TO OTHER 

1433
01:03:00,776 --> 01:03:01,711
SENATORS, SOMEBODY ASKED HIM, 

1434
01:03:01,711 --> 01:03:02,445
DO YOU NOT BELIEVE THE 

1435
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:02,745
SURVIVORS? 

1436
01:03:02,745 --> 01:03:03,212
TO WHICH JOE MANCHIN 

1437
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:04,046
ESSENTIALLY SAID, I'VE HEARD A 

1438
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:04,914
LOT OF HEARTFELT STORIES BUT 

1439
01:03:04,914 --> 01:03:05,548
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT 

1440
01:03:05,548 --> 01:03:06,582
THIS IS ABOUT BECAUSE WE DON'T 

1441
01:03:06,582 --> 01:03:07,416
HAVE THE CORROBORATING -- IN 

1442
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,317
FACT, HE SAID THAT. 

1443
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:08,850
THERE IS AN CORROBORATING 

1444
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,586
EVIDENCE THAT WHAT DR. FORD IS 

1445
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:15,124
ALLEGING HAPPENED TO HER BY 

1446
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,125
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY DID IN 

1447
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:16,458
FACT HAPPEN. 

1448
01:03:16,458 --> 01:03:17,193
THAT FACTORS INTO THE DECISION 

1449
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,161
THAT THESE MEMBERS ARE GOING TO 

1450
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:18,861
BE MAKING. 

1451
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,196
AND NUMBER THREE, EARLIER 

1452
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:20,963
TODAY, WHEN SENATOR MANCHIN 

1453
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:21,697
CROSSED PARTY LINES AND VOTED 

1454
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:28,738
FOR THAT PROCEDURAL VOTE  TO 

1455
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:29,972
CLOTURE, TO END DEBATE, THAT'S 

1456
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:30,773
A BIG DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO 

1457
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:31,207
CAPITOL HILL. 

1458
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:31,974
USUALLY, THOSE VOTES ARE 

1459
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:32,574
PARTYLINE VOTES BECAUSE THEY 

1460
01:03:32,574 --> 01:03:35,778
ARE PROCEDURAL  AND YOU WANT TO 

1461
01:03:35,778 --> 01:03:36,445
STICK WITH YOUR PARTY. 

1462
01:03:36,445 --> 01:03:37,213
ESSENTIALLY, HIS VOTE WAS TO 

1463
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,414
GIVE CONTROL OF THE FLOOR BACK 

1464
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:41,117
TO THE REPUBLICANS AND TO LET 

1465
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:41,550
THAT MOVE FORWARD. 

1466
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:42,584
THAT WAS A BIG MOVE EARLIER 

1467
01:03:42,584 --> 01:03:43,753
TODAY AND SORT OF PROJECTED HOW 

1468
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,254
HE WOULD VOTE FOR THE FINAL 

1469
01:03:45,254 --> 01:03:45,721
CONFIRMATION. 

1470
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:48,691
BUT AGAIN, THIS HAS JUST BEEN A 

1471
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:50,493
VERY TOUGH ISSUE, AS SUSAN 

1472
01:03:50,493 --> 01:04:01,404
COLLINS WAS SAYING, IN THAT, 

1473
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:02,705
YOU DO HAVE PEOPLE UP HERE ON 

1474
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:03,539
CAPITOL HILL, AS BOB CORKER WAS 

1475
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:04,507
SAYING TO ME, PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

1476
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,774
TAKEN THE DAY OFF OF THEIR JOBS 

1477
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:06,943
COME UP BECAUSE THIS ISSUE, 

1478
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:07,910
SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THEIR 

1479
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,110
PAST. 

1480
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:08,811
THIS ISSUE HAS DREDGED IT ALL 

1481
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:10,146
UP AGAIN AND THEY HAD TO COME 

1482
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:17,720
UP AND TALK TO A SENATOR AND 

1483
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:18,721
TELL THEM WHY THEY OPPOSE BRETT 

1484
01:04:18,721 --> 01:04:19,288
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 

1485
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:20,222
BUT AGAIN HE ALSO SAID SOME OF 

1486
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:21,324
THESE OF THE PROTESTERS UP HERE 

1487
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,191
WHO ARE JUST GETTING IN YOUR 

1488
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:23,025
FACE AND PREVENTING US FROM 

1489
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,493
DOING OUR JOB, THAT'S NOT WHAT 

1490
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:24,861
THIS IS. 

1491
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,728
AND SO, I THINK THAT'S 

1492
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:26,696
PARTIALLY IN THE BACK OF SOME 

1493
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,364
OF THESE SENATORS MINDS. 

1494
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,899
BUT, MORE SO, THEY HAVE TO 

1495
01:04:29,899 --> 01:04:30,866
REPRESENT THEIR CONSTITUENTS. 

1496
01:04:30,866 --> 01:04:32,768
>> MOLLY, WE ARE GETTING SOME 

1497
01:04:32,768 --> 01:04:42,178
REACTION FROM CAPITOL HILL, 

1498
01:04:42,178 --> 01:04:42,912
FROM FELLOW REPUBLICAN SENATORS 

1499
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:43,546
INCLUDING SENATOR CORNYN WHO 

1500
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,081
SAYS I'M PROUD OF SENATOR 

1501
01:04:45,081 --> 01:04:45,614
COLLINS FOR RESISTING THE 

1502
01:04:45,614 --> 01:04:45,948
INTIMIDATION. 

1503
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:46,515
FOLKS ON THE RIGHT REALLY 

1504
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:47,984
BELIEVED THAT THIS WAS AN  

1505
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:49,452
INNOCENT MAN, A MAN WHO HAD 

1506
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,052
GREAT JUDICIA REVIEW, SOMEONE 

1507
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,921
WHO HAD JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT, 

1508
01:04:51,921 --> 01:04:53,122
WHO HAD WORKED HARD TO GET TO 

1509
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:53,422
THIS LEVEL. 

1510
01:04:53,422 --> 01:05:00,363
AND, NOT EVERYONE BELIEVED DR. 

1511
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:00,763
FORD'S TESTIMONY. 

1512
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:01,296
WHAT DOES IT MEAN? 

1513
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:02,164
EVEN THOUGH SUSAN COLLINS HAS 

1514
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:03,299
SAYS THAT SHE BELIEVES IN THE 

1515
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:04,600
ME TOO MOVEMENT AND CASTING 

1516
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,236
THIS VOTE  DOES NOT MEAN SHE IS 

1517
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,037
AGAINST THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. 

1518
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:08,804
IT'S REALLY HARD, AS YOU'RE 

1519
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:10,106
WATCHING REACTION ON SOCIAL 

1520
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:12,174
MEDIA RIGHT NOW, SEEING WOMEN 

1521
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:13,942
SAY, IF YOU REALLY BELIEVED IN 

1522
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:14,176
 

1523
01:05:14,176 --> 01:05:16,545
NOT HOW YOU WOULD CAST YOUR 

1524
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:17,579
VOTE. 

1525
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:18,614
>> Reporter: WELL AGAIN, YOU 

1526
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,448
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THOSE 

1527
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:19,715
SENATORS. 

1528
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:20,549
I GO BACK TO BOB CORKER, 

1529
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:21,416
BECAUSE HE IS REALLY A MIDDLE-

1530
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:22,218
OF-THE-ROAD GUY. 

1531
01:05:22,218 --> 01:05:26,122
HE SAID HE HAS SPOKEN OUT MORE 

1532
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:26,856
TIMES AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1533
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:31,660
THAN SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE. 

1534
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,728
BUT AGAIN, WHEN IT COMES DOWN 

1535
01:05:32,728 --> 01:05:33,696
TO THIS ISSUE, AND AGAIN, HE 

1536
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:34,764
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST 

1537
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:38,034
REPUBLICANS TO CALL FOR,  YOU 

1538
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:38,768
KNOW, A DELAY IN KAVANAUGH'S 

1539
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,769
NOMINATION IN ORDER TO HAVE A 

1540
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:45,141
HEARING TO HEAR FROM DR. FORD,  

1541
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:45,808
OR A PRIVATE MEETING, WHATEVER 

1542
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:46,142
IT WAS. 

1543
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,309
BUT, TO HAVE DR. FORD TELL HER 

1544
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:50,880
STORY TO THE SENATORS AND THE 

1545
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,381
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHO WOULD 

1546
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:53,449
BE VOTING AND ULTIMATELY TO THE 

1547
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:54,550
SENATE AS A BODY WHO WOULD BE 

1548
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:54,783
VOTING. 

1549
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:56,085
HE SAID, THERE ARE THESE 

1550
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:59,188
INTIMIDATION TACTICS GOING ON 

1551
01:05:59,188 --> 01:05:59,421
HERE. 

1552
01:05:59,421 --> 01:05:59,988
AND, REALLY DIFFERENTIATED 

1553
01:05:59,988 --> 01:06:00,522
BETWEEN, YOU KNOW, THE 

1554
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:02,024
PROTESTERS WHO ARE UP HERE 

1555
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:04,293
EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW, IN YOUR 

1556
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,127
FACE, AND EXPOSING PEOPLE'S 

1557
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:09,699
HOME ADDRESSES AND WHATNOT. 

1558
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:10,699
AND, THOSE PEOPLE WHO COME UP 

1559
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:11,767
AND ARE TALKING ONE-ON-ONE WITH 

1560
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:14,236
SENATORS AND SAYING, PLEASE, 

1561
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:15,170
THIS IS WHY I OPPOSE HIM. 

1562
01:06:15,170 --> 01:06:26,816
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH, YOU DO 

1563
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:27,750
HEAR FROM SENATORS LIKE SUSAN 

1564
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,651
COLLINS, LIKE BOB CORKER, WHO 

1565
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:29,251
SAY THERE ISN'T CORROBORATING 

1566
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:29,918
EVIDENCE THAT THIS HAPPENED. 

1567
01:06:29,918 --> 01:06:30,953
AND IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU ARE 

1568
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:31,687
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 

1569
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,255
THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL COURT. 

1570
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:34,323
BUT, IN DENYING SOMEBODY A JOB 

1571
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:35,257
BASED ON ALLEGATIONS FROM 40 

1572
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:38,794
YEARS AGO THAT CAN'T BE 

1573
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:42,465
CORROBORATED, IT SETS A 

1574
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:43,065
DIFFICULT PRECEDENT FOR 

1575
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,066
INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD WANT TO 

1576
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,501
COME FORWARD AND BE NOMINEES IN 

1577
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,169
THE FUTURE. 

1578
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:47,970
WHY PUT YOURSELF THROUGH THAT 

1579
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:48,904
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S 

1580
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:50,372
GOING TO COME AT YOU? 

1581
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:51,440
TRUE OR NOT. 

1582
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,274
AND AGAIN, IT'S UNCLEAR IF 

1583
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:53,743
THESE ARE TRUE OR NOT. 

1584
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:57,246
AT THIS POINT, I THINK THAT'S 

1585
01:06:57,246 --> 01:06:57,946
WHAT I'M HEARING SENATORS SAY. 

1586
01:06:57,946 --> 01:07:01,183
YOU WILL HEAR VARYING DEGREES 

1587
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:01,584
OF THAT. 

1588
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:02,751
BUT FOR FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE 

1589
01:07:02,751 --> 01:07:03,318
LIKE SUSAN COLLINS, LISA 

1590
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:06,655
MURKOWSKI TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, 

1591
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:07,556
LIKE JOE MANCHIN, IT'S REALLY 

1592
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:08,357
THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 

1593
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:08,891
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 

1594
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:14,930
AND, THE WAY THAT CERTAIN 

1595
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:18,533
DEMOCRATS HANDLED THE HEARING 

1596
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,167
AND THOSE ALLEGATIONS. 

1597
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:23,038
>> MOLLY HOOPER, THANK YOU SO 

1598
01:07:23,038 --> 01:07:24,106
