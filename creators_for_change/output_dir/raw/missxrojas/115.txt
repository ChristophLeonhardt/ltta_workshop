100
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,330
if I've learnt anything this year is

101
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's so so easy to mix strange and</font>

102
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:20,259
unfair assumptions about others

103
00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:22,150
character of course there are some

104
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,849
people you like and some you won't but

105
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,830
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ads should call someone a bad person</font>

106
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,190
a less than person someone not worthy of

107
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,770
a chance is in all the most personal

108
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,870
hurtful of instances thoroughly

109
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,050
misplaced and hurtful I think to all of

110
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,750
us obviously this isn't a sweeping

111
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,430
statement there are people I've cut out

112
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,930
of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> life you do not get another chance</font>

113
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,720
ever but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that marking middle</font>

114
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,819
space the spectrum space

115
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,290
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the drizzling day here in</font>

116
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,200
London and my way to meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> up Lucy early</font>

117
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,640
