What's in your wallet? Shannon: THE PRESIDENT DEFENDING HIS ADMINISTRATION ZERO-TOLERANCE IMMIGRATION POLICY, OVERSHADOWING ANOTHER ANNOUNCEMENT THAT UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD HAVE MADE MAJOR NEWS. THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO CREATE A SIXTH BRANCH OF THE U.S. ARMED FORCES, A SO-CALLED SPACE FORCE. IF YOU WOULD CARRY THAT ASSIGNMENT OUT, I WOULD BE VERY GREATLY HONORED. ALSO, WHERE GENERAL DUNFORD? Shannon: IT APPEARS HE STILL HAS A WAY TO GO TO SELL THE IDEA, EVEN TO SOME WITHIN HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION. BUT IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE AN IMPORTANT PROJECT FOR HIM SO WE WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHY. JOINING US NOW, REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN DOUG LAMBORN, WHO SITS ON THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. I'M GLAD TO DO SO. Shannon: LISTEN, THERE ARE FOLKS TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL SPACE FOR LOOMING. THEY SAY WE ARE WAY BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO CHINA AND RUSSIA. IT'S NOT A TOPIC WE HEAR A LOT TO HEAR ABOUT. WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW? WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF OUR SPACE WOULD BE AFFECTED IN A TIME OF WAR, WE WOULD BE DEAF, DUMB, AND BLIND. WE NEED TO SHOW THE OTHER SIDE THAT WE CAN PUT THEIR ASSETS AT RISK. THIS ALL REQUIRES MAKING MILITARY OR DEFENSIVE SPACE MORE A PRIORITY, EVEN THEN IT IS RIGHT NOW. ARE NOT JUST WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS AFTER. I THINK THAT IS VERY EXCITING, AND TIMELY AND NECESSARY. Shannon: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE AIR FORCE HANDLES ABOUT 80% OF THIS RIGHT NOW. BY SOME REPORTS, THEY WERE NOT EXCITED ABOUT THIS. HERE'S WITH THE WITH THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE HAD TO SAY. A FEW MONTHS BACK. "OPPOSE THE CREATION OF A NEW MILITARY SERVICE AND ADDITIONAL ORGANIZATIONAL LEADERS AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE FOCUSED ON REDUCING OVERHEAD AND INTEGRATING JOINT WAR FIGHTING FUNCTIONS." WHAT YOU MAKE OF THAT? I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL PART OF THE PHRASE BUT OVER THE DEFENSIVE SECRETARY. WHAT THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF DESIRES IS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE HOUSE AND SENATE ARE IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITIONS. THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE MORE REFORM MINDED. THE SENATE IS A LITTLE MORE STATUS QUO MINDED. BUT WE NEED TO DO WHATEVER THE FINAL VERSION IS, WE HAVE TO MAKE SPACE MORE OF A PRIORITY. THE AIR FORCE IS TAKING SOME GOOD STEPS, DOING SOME GOOD THINGS, DOING A STUDY RIGHT NOW, FOR INSTANCE, BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT SPACE IS MORE OF A PRIORITY. IT WON'T CREATE MORE BUREAUCRACY NECESSARILY. THE KEY IS TO MAKE IT BETTER FUNDED, A BETTER PRIORITY, THAT THE PERSONNEL WITHIN THE SPACE HAVE MORE CLOUT AND PRESTIGE, AND SET THE ACQUISITION THIS IS ALL IMPORTANT THAT THE ACQUISITION PROCESS IS FASTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE. RIGHT NOW IT TAKES FIVE TO TEN YEARS TO PUT A SATELLITE UP INTO SPACE. THAT IS WAY TOO LONG. TECHNOLOGY CHANGES SO FAST. Shannon: I KNOW THE PENTAGON HAS BEEN WORKING ON A NUMBER OF STUDIES, ONE MAJOR ONE, INDEPENDENT REVIEW ORDERED BY CONGRESS, NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE UNTIL DECEMBER. SOME FOLKS WONDER IF HE IS JUMPING THE GUN. SENATOR BILL NELSON, DEMOCRAT WHO HAPPENS TO BE A FORMER ASTRONAUT, SAYS THE PRESIDENT TOLD A U.S. GENERAL TO CREATE A SPACE FOR US, SIXTH BRANCH OF THE MILITARY TODAY, GENERALS TELLING ME THEY DON'T WANT TO. THANKFULLY THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT CONGRESS BECAUSE IT NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO RIP THE AIR FORCE APART. TOO MANY IMPORTANT MEASURES THAT I STAYED FOR IT WILL CONGRESS CONGRESS PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN DEFINE THE PARAMETERS AND HOW THE PROCESS WILL BE DONE AND EVEN SOME OF THE FINAL VERSION WILL LOOK LIKE. THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF HAS THE BIGGEST VOICE OF ALL. I DISAGREE WITH SENATOR NELSON. IT'S NOT THE PRIORITY RIGHT NOW THAT IT NEEDS TO BE. IT'S TUGGED INTO MANY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THE FUNDING FOR IT SOMETIMES GETS SIPHONED OFF INTO OTHER THINGS, BECAUSE IS NOT THE PRIORITY THAT IT SHOULD BE. WE ALL AGREE ON THE OBJECTIVE, EVEN IF WE DISAGREE ON HOW TO GET THERE.
