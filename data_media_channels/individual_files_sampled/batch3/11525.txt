police in Britain have confirmed they are treating a car crash outside Parliament as a terror attack the vehicle crashed into security barriers after injuring cyclists and pedestrians during choose the morning rush hour the driver was detained by armed police who rushed to the scene well around 7:30 a.m. a silver hatchback drove at speed through the Westminster area before crushing into barriers outside the houses of parliament coming down this way to here but for Parliament's summer recess this would really normally just be a bustling government area though with iconic landmarks nearby Big Ben is there at Westminster Abbey as well it's always very popular with tourists now police have lifted the cordon from around the area and say intelligence indicates there is no further danger to the public what we do know is that three people have been injured two were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries and the driver was arrested on suspicion of terror offences and they said not to be cooperating however it is believed he's from the city of Birmingham in the Midlands following the incident extra officers are patrolling the streets of England Scotland and Wales and currently a government emergency Committee known as Cobra is holding a matter meeting on the matter I think that is still ongoing right now Alice to see a Turkana in the meantime reports for us from Westminster we are as close as physically possible to the houses of parliament that area is now cordoned off as you can see behind me while police now investigate what it is exactly that happened what we do know is about 20 minutes before 8:00 in the morning what is being described as a silver Ford Fiesta had hit cyclist and then crashed into security barriers right outside houses of parliament again Parliament right now is in recess so no MPs were present there at the time and we know that armed police had arrested one man and taken him to of inter custody to a police station in South London where he is being questioned according to Scotland Yard however this man is not cooperating with authorities quite yet this is what they had to say the driver of the Fiesta who was alone in the vehicle was arrested at the scene by armed officers who were already nearby the man is in his late 20s and he's been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses and has been taken to a South London police station where he remains in custody given that this appears to be a deliberate act the method and this being an iconic site we are treating it as a terrorist incident and the investigation is being led by officers from the counterterrorism command two people were injured and taken her to hospital it's understood that they're not in critical condition and are going to be fine following this attack and we've been talking to a witness here a local resident who saw it all with his own my eyes let's take a listen to how he described what happened I've seen a car driving erratically two rules our department and we've actually hit the one of the big Borlaug's the barriers did you see the man who was in the car for the arrest yeah I kind of saw I think he's a was quite talk and he is straight to share I think and he seemed quiet Tom to me he didn't seem wasn't I didn't seem I didn't hear him screaming or anything all shouting and didn't resist arrest it's worrying because I'm a father of two young sons you know aged almost seven and five and a half and it's worrying I mean but this this is like this is one of this is like the number one city in the world in my opinion London you know there's so many tourists come here throughout the year and you know it's beautiful weather and you know another thing I understand all the MPs are on holiday so whoever land is I don't know what it's all about well if confirmed by the police that this is a terrorist attack it's going to turn out to be the first one this year but unfortunately one of several to have taken place recently you won't succeed you undivided we won't be cowered by terrorists you will see over the next few days an increased number of armed and unarmed officers across London the attempt to divide us met countless acts of kindness that brought people closer together there continue to be visible patrols around Manchester which include the deployment of armed officers Londoners will see an increased police presence today and over the course of the next few days no reason to be alarmed Londoners will see an increased number of visible police officers well we have discussed the incident with former intelligence officer Charles Shoebridge and ex British police officer Roger gray there's no question that intelligence is key to foiling thwarting and arguably even preventing these attacks taking place and in that respect for example as we've seen today if the intelligence systems fail to the extent that an attacker actually gets through to his target today it was against a hard target but worst it was it to be a softer target in terms of civilians in the street for example tourists and so on then of course there's nothing can be done at that stage or very little it can be done to actually protect them should this indeed turn out to be a terrorist attack but of course it's too early at this stage at least to speculate about today's incident on whether any of those considerations will actually apply but generally speaking of course intelligence cooperation between the different intelligence bodies and the trust that's needed between those intelligence bodies to actually share intelligence in a meaningful way and in a timely way rather than just sitting on the intelligence is absolutely vital and not just between European and other partners but between the intelligence services and the police in countries themselves including as has been a problem in the past in the United Kingdom - there's a danger of overreaction as well London is congested enough as it is at times and if we start adding more sort of no-go zones as it were that's that's got to become worse and also we don't want to give any terrorists or an oppressor any sense of success in carrying us into doing one thing or the other result of their actions so it's something they should be considered but white very carefully you
