Shemp hello to everyone from aboard the ISS my name is Alexander misurkin and today I'd like to talk to you about water as you well know water is just as important in space as it is on earth but you need water to drink to take showers and maintain proper hygiene and to turn our space food which is subliminal that is dehydrated in a special way into actual food we also use water to generate oxygen through the process of electrolysis but that's not all you know spare time we can use water to play games like tennis table tennis of course let me show you how it's done you take some water shape it into a steer and now we have a ball in order to play table tennis you need at least one racquet and of course a friend to play with well it worked with one racket that's nice and now we have made some balls more than now we can juggle them now me a chicken and of course you wouldn't call this place a sports ground but still leukemia for me let me ask you a question but you more why does the water ball stick to one surface and not to the other smell up there correct it doesn't stick to the racket what it does to the mirror why do you think that is let me give you a clue you'll find the answer in an eighth grade physics textbooks
