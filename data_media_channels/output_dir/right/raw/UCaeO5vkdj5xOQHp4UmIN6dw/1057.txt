1
00:00:00,252 --> 00:00:01,579
- Andrew, so good to see you.

2
00:00:01,579 --> 00:00:04,370
Why, why haven't, why
not a documentary about,

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,737
you know, poor dumb Homer Simpson.

4
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:11,042
Or nerdy Christian Ned
Flanders. Why is it just Apu?

5
00:00:11,042 --> 00:00:12,957
- It's an excellent question, I mean,

6
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:13,990
the show has been making fun of

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:18,047
every single human being
on Earth for over 10 years.

8
00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:21,051
I have no idea why you single
out this one character.

9
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:23,675
I mean, this is kind
of what you worry about

10
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:24,857
when you have nothing to worry about.

11
00:00:24,857 --> 00:00:26,607
This is what you worry
about when you're in a rich,

12
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:28,148
safe, happy country where you will

13
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:30,500
probably gonna live to be like 84.

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,082
You know your generation
is gonna like build

15
00:00:33,082 --> 00:00:36,222
little cities on Mars and
like, nothing's wrong.

16
00:00:36,222 --> 00:00:38,040
You really don't have a
problem, you have a job,

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,063
you're making money, this
guy, the guy who started

18
00:00:40,063 --> 00:00:42,905
this complain is a comedian
who's doing pretty well.

19
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:45,460
This is what you worry, you
worry about a cartoon, you know.

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,876
And it's just embarrassing, and it's also,

21
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:50,592
I mean the only thing
fun for the rest of us

22
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,925
is it's the left eating itself.

23
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:54,609
It's basically left wingers, you know,

24
00:00:54,609 --> 00:00:56,009
people who are making fun of the culture

25
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:57,500
are now no good because
they are making fun

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,606
of a culture, including its stereotypes.

27
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:02,589
It's kind of like, I don't understand

28
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:05,355
where the lefties' sense of
humor is gonna come from.

29
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,753
Or maybe they think they're
not gonna need jokes.

30
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:10,027
One of the complains that this guy made is

31
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:12,476
that the voice of Apu
is done by a white man.

32
00:01:12,476 --> 00:01:15,326
The white man happens, who
happens to be Hank Azaria,

33
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:18,989
who is one of the greatest
voice man in show business ever.

34
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,871
I mean a guy who can do
almost any accent, any voice.

35
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:24,033
You can't recognize him
from one role to another.

36
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,936
He's a genius at this, and
like they're gonna attacked him

37
00:01:26,936 --> 00:01:28,649
because his skin color is white.

38
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:31,602
It is just, it is utterly
amazing, it's kind of (laughs)

39
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:33,430
you know like everything
in life at this point.

40
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,451
It's kind of tragic and
hilarious at the same time.

41
00:01:36,451 --> 00:01:38,672
Tragic because it's sad to
see one half of the country

42
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:40,425
just give over to racism like this.

43
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:43,452
And hilarious because these
are supposed to be the people

44
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:45,423
who are the anti-racist, these
are the guys that have been

45
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:48,692
slinging at this racist
slur and conservative slur

46
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,135
for all those years and now
they've just degraded themselves

47
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:53,210
to the point where they're
pointing at each other

48
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,654
"You're white but you
wrote about a black person"

49
00:01:55,654 --> 00:01:57,643
or "You're a woman but
you wrote about a man"

50
00:01:57,643 --> 00:01:59,516
you know, "Men are not
allowed to write about women",

51
00:01:59,516 --> 00:02:02,294
"Women are not", you know
it's utterly unbelievable.

52
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:04,605
And by the way Dana, out
here in Hollywood now,

53
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:07,800
agents get phone calls
from producers saying

54
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,286
"I need a latino female
to write this part".

55
00:02:11,286 --> 00:02:14,827
You know, they have actually
outlaw the imagination,

56
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,828
they've outlaw the idea that
a guy like William Shakespeare

57
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,319
could ever create a black character

58
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,301
like Othello and make it matter.

59
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:23,915
- Wow, I didn't even know that.

60
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:27,134
That's incredibly troubling,
they are banning imagination.

61
00:02:27,134 --> 00:02:29,117
The other thing I thought about

62
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,433
when I was looking at this is

63
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:32,782
I think Ned Flanders besides
his dorkiness is probably

64
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:34,676
one of the more well adjusted characters.

65
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:37,418
But Apu is a success
story and it felt like

66
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:38,876
they were looking down in the fact

67
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,299
that here is this immigrant
who comes to the United States,

68
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,866
raises a family, he's
running a successful business

69
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:46,087
that everybody relies upon in the town.

70
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:48,476
And apparently that's shameful.

71
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:50,273
- You know, it's funny
that you mention that

72
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,027
because I think you're absolutely right.

73
00:02:52,027 --> 00:02:55,821
And, Ned Flanders is a great
example, he's kind of dorky,

74
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:58,496
not kind of dorky, he is
the definition of dorky,

75
00:02:58,496 --> 00:03:01,346
he is a living dork, and
he's silly and he is like

76
00:03:01,346 --> 00:03:03,809
a lot a religious people I know.

77
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,302
He's hyper friendly and
hyper peaceful and on,

78
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:08,701
but everything he says
always turns out to be true.

79
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:11,926
And God does show up on the
Simpsons from time to time

80
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:13,866
and reck justice and give mercy.

81
00:03:13,866 --> 00:03:16,951
And actually Ned Flanders
always turns out to be right.

82
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,286
And the same thing is true of Apu.

83
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:20,210
You can make all the fun of him you want

84
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:22,135
for his accent or whatever
but he's a successful

85
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:25,558
American story of a guy
who's built a business.

86
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,610
And I think that is that's the funny thing

87
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,677
about The Simpsons in general is that

88
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:32,480
it has the dopey father and
the steady mom and all this,

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,291
but it really is a kind of
pin to the American family.

90
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:39,055
And it, it really does this so well,

91
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:42,407
where it makes fun of all us on a one hand

92
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:45,343
but also kind of has a
tenderness at its heart

93
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:48,352
which is I think why it's
been on the air so long.

94
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,067
It's not just running people
down, it actually shows

95
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,622
that things work the
way they're supposed to.

96
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:58,395
And I think that's kind of
nice about The Simpsons.

97
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:02,978
- I feel that comedy is
finding fewer places of refuge.

98
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:05,904
They don't, comedy doesn't really

99
00:04:05,904 --> 00:04:08,954
have a lot of places to go anymore Andrew,

100
00:04:08,954 --> 00:04:11,528
and it's like, that's the
last frontier for free speech

101
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:14,166
and it just seems like
it's getting smaller.

102
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:16,559
- Well, you know, I mean,
if you real problems

103
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:18,024
you need a sense of humor.

104
00:04:18,024 --> 00:04:20,775
You know, if you're under
the gun, if you're enslaved,

105
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,510
if you're oppressed, if you're beaten,

106
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,774
you need a sense of humor.

107
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:25,690
But if you're living in
this country right now

108
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,840
where nothing bad as ever
happening to anybody basically,

109
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,599
certainly not on a kind
of a governmental level,

110
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,209
the government isn't oppressing people.

111
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:34,728
You're not being
oppressed if you're black,

112
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:36,241
you're not being oppressed if you're gay.

113
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,799
These people don't really
have problems (laughs).

114
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:41,241
So they don't, they
have to be super serious

115
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,191
to pretend they're important.

116
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:44,649
You know, it gives them
a sense of importance,

117
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,041
it give them a sense
that they have something,

118
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,508
some injustice to fight,
some major battle to wage.

119
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:51,780
- Fake it until you make it.

120
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,278
You know, that's what they say.

121
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:54,761
- Yeah, that's right. I Think
it will be so much better

122
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,998
if they would be concentrating
on doing positive things.

123
00:04:56,998 --> 00:04:58,973
Like building new businesses,
building rocket ships,

124
00:04:58,973 --> 00:05:01,081
building ways that we
can explore new planets,

125
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:03,952
all kind of things that
this generation has to do.

126
00:05:03,952 --> 00:05:06,411
And we've just got a whole
generation of whiners,

127
00:05:06,411 --> 00:05:09,121
complaining about cartoons (laughs).

128
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:11,987
- Yeah, (stutters), I thought
they would, if they're gonna

129
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:14,662
pick on something that's
offensive, my gosh South Park.

130
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,753
And South Park doesn't
have any of the tenderness.

131
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:18,103
I love that you pick up on that.

132
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:20,363
The tenderness of The
Simpsons, because it does,

133
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:23,070
I mean, there are times when
it's you know, both part,

134
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,437
ridiculous and also very
tender but then you have

135
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:27,836
South Park that just goes out
and just pommels the crap out

136
00:05:27,836 --> 00:05:30,697
at every single person, no one is safe.

137
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,995
Everyone gets ruthlessly
mocked and made fun of,

138
00:05:32,995 --> 00:05:36,517
and they regularly kill off
their main character so,

139
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:40,057
I mean it's funny they
didn't pick on South Park.

140
00:05:40,057 --> 00:05:42,809
Probably because they'll
make an episode out of it.

141
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,450
- That's exactly right.
In South Park, South Park,

142
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,058
those guys are republicans
and they are libertarians

143
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,901
and they don't care about this stuff.

144
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,192
So if you attack them they will come back

145
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,969
and just make fun of you for doing it.

146
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:56,452
They'll made fun out of
their political correctness.

147
00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:59,395
They always go after, that's
why they go after their own,

148
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:00,987
because we won't listen to them.

149
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:02,703
If they attack you Dana
you're not gonna respond,

150
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,261
you're not gonna be
cowed. But if they attack

151
00:06:05,261 --> 00:06:07,750
somebody who actually
kind of agrees with them,

152
00:06:07,750 --> 00:00:00,000
they might agree and they
might get some headwound.
