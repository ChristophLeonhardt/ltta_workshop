1
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,290
First you get on a bus,
you get comfortable

2
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,310
and then that's when they turn on 
movies. And after a while, I fall asleep.

3
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,720
I don't talk to anyone about my dad 
being in prison.

4
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:39,968
Please everyone, you leave everything
on the bus, no electronics

5
00:00:39,968 --> 00:00:45,117
no cellphones. Just have your 
money if you are taking money.

6
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:48,417
If you have a baby with you you...

7
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:52,114
And then we walk in the prison and 
they call our names

8
00:00:52,114 --> 00:00:55,820
by alphabetical order. 
And then we walk in the they check us

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,860
and then I run to him and hug him.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,860
I don't, I don't like being in a prison.

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,350
I love my kids, I go do anything to try 
to get them, be there for them,

12
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,910
communicate with them.

13
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,160
They didn't even ask to be here, to
go through this, but they are here in it.

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,160
They don't know exactly when I get out.

15
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,460
Because there was problems 
that I would have with my daughter,

16
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,430
where she would be distant.
And she said to me,

17
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,470
you're my dad I know you,
but I don't know you.

18
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,201
He says he has a 50-50 percent 
chance he might get out.

19
00:01:46,428 --> 00:00:00,000
It's going to be different if he
came home, I would be happy.
