Jason Kessler is the white nationalist who decided to organize the hate rally that took place in Charlottesville Virginia now he has let FoxNews know that he's had to go into hiding because he has gotten so many death threats now it's unsurprising that he'd get death threats death threats are just a common part of society now and it is fair to assume that some of those death threats come from those on the left and I also want to be fair to him he did get attacked when he tried to hold a press conference after the violence in Charlottesville Virginia and that did not go well in fact we have video from that so this this goes in a lot of direction so first of course it's hard not to be amused by people who are in favor of white power running from of course for a band of white people they're from a press conference that they that they organize doesn't look very powerful that's okay but overall the main thing about attacking them or threatening him is don't do it don't sink to their level you don't need to do it the violence is their calling card not our calling card so you should I think they should have let them finish that press conference I'm not afraid of white nationalist ideas I think they sound preposterous if we're gonna give you some of Kessler's quotes here in a second and we'll shred those but that's in the battlefield of ideas and threatening look man you don't know where the threatening leads don't do it it's and you start with kestler I don't know where it ends and you shouldn't start with Kessler let alone wherever it ends so that's that's my strong opinion on that issue yeah and I it's easy to say all but they're white nationalists of course I know we fight white nationalists every single day here on the show but when you stoop to their tactics it doesn't help anybody and when you get physical with them when you get violent with them you are essentially giving them a gift right yeah they love it then they get to they love being victims but you can shout them down please practice your First Amendment right and let them know what you think but don't get physical yeah and by the way shouting than that them dad I also want to be clear about that it was in the context of a Nazi rally right you get to have speech against them right damn freedom of speech you have freedom of speech within the context of a an organized speech I'd let any speaker speak again look this thing we showed you yesterday in Seattle well these all right guys I'm gonna bring you a lot of statues yeah and since no button gave him pay him any mind 7du chota there when you just let him spout their nonsense it's incredibly ineffectual by the way that's what usually happens that's what happened in Charlottesville Charlottesville has had a rally once a month since May at least once a month since May since they announced that the Lee statue is coming down it's only when they sort of made this huge convocation of white people of haters come there and have this kind of you know big big group that this kind that this sort of thing happened people kind of ignored them in Charlottesville at these small rallies we didn't even know they were happening right and so that that's very an effective thing to do is to just let them you know scream in a vacuum let him scream in the darkness anyway yes so let's get to the good parts of the story so as I mentioned Kessler let Fox News know that he's afraid for his safety and so he's gone into hiding and so again while I certainly agree that there might be those on the Left who are threatening him there are also those on the far right who are also threatening him which amazes me because they think he's part of some sort of false flag conspiracy and he's actually a liberal who's just trying to make the white supremacist look bad I'm not kidding it's amazing now first let's start with his own conspiracies okay Kessler had tweeted the following what occurred in Charlottesville was a conspiracy to violate my civil rights in violation of a federal court judge's order now the irony of that is so thick it's just awesome it's one of the best ironies I've ever seen now of course african-americans shouldn't have their civil rights but you're violating my civil rights to say that how dare you if their lack of empathy is stunning and the fact that they can't even see it shows also their lack of intellect now here's the super interesting part ok pro-trump far-right commenters are now trying to distance themselves from Kessler in the wake of the deadly Charlottesville riots claiming that he was paid by the liberal philanthropist George Soros to invite several neo-nazi and KKK groups to smear everyone attending ok so let me give you this is amazing let me give you an actual quote from a far-right Trump supporter in one of these uh Trump reddit forums or whatever of threads he just did some digging and I found out that this little fuck was a leftist operative until when you guessed it November 2016 oh my gosh okay unite the right is a soros funded honey honeypot PSYOP that employs the Pied Piper strategy to damage the Republican brand by insinuating that anti-fog UN's disguised as Nazis represent the views of the entire right wing in America okay so where we read all those guys on tape who said you know chanted blood and soil well the Jews will not replace us then later our made videos crying about how the police are gonna get them and said two commentators on the scene oh we're gonna go get the Jew lovers they were all actors and by the way stunningly good actors great actors are hired by you know nobody loves the Nazi more than George Soros so he's just gonna pay as much as he can to get one out there I mean the reason Mark Michael jokes about that is because George Soros has helped fund movements to help Holocaust survivors I mean he is nothing like what the right says he also fought communism and and helped to topple communism in Eastern Europe right so he's the and he's a huge capitalist he's a giant financial guru right any one of the top financial guys in the in the world maybe in the history of the world he's deep capitalist but they're like oh there's leftist who loves the Nazis so no no that left didn't have to make you look bad you look bad if you're good enough job that on your own that was your guys who showed up in your uniforms with the the khakis and the white shirts and held the torches so now that this hilarious excuse of look I think it was like a false flag man no but honestly okay so now they're angry with a far-right Trump supporters hate Kessler they think he's part of some conspiracy and it made me realize something look we can sit here and criticize what's going on with the right-wing all we want but it's not going to be as effective as the right-wing eating one another and that's what's happening right now like they are destroying one another right and so that party's imploding that part of the electorate is imploding and it's delicious and it's a microcosm of the White House I mean that we that's with this sort of the punctuation you can put on this day of all days it's they're eating each other there too so why not eat them eat each other in the streets and eat each other the White House and it makes perfect sense on a day that Steve Bannon has left the White House as scrum uchi famously said of him that he likes to suck his own cock speaking of eating each other TYT membership gets your commercial-free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that
