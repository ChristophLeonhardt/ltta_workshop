now as part of my work as an aussie psychiatrist i assess bullying claims in the workplace now over the last decade what i've seen is a growing prioritization of perceptions when we look at bullying now I'll explain now this making it much harder for employers to manage the greater expectation they have now on managing the emotional well-being of their employees which i think is a bit over the top especially the case is our society much like Canada or other Western democracies become more ethnically diverse this creates a wider variety of perceptions around any incident or statement there's also this huge run in realignment around gender relations now this complicates what we expect around appropriate behavior even more now let me give you an example I remember as a doctor where I saw an English colleague and he was asked to do photocopying by nurse so this is an big passing officer sort of Greater egalitarian ethos of Australia now the same thing when happened to an Indian or Chinese doctor they saw it through the lens of race and saw it as a slight on their status and it shows how attitudes to hierarchy and authority can be part of claims say around mistreatment you know they virtually saw it as racist when bullying research first arose in say the 1970 the focus on school kids the definition was very much about repeated intentional hostility and had to involve some kind of power imbalance now the concept then spread to say the workplace and now social media now this is appropriate especially Australia recent there's been a you know tragic suicide of a teenager called dolly Everett she lived in the Northern Territory she's actually the former face of a k√ºbra the Hat now as cyberbullying was seen to be a factor in a suicide and as a result the Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has really put on a national emphasis on tackling bullying but what's changed about bullying is this importance around intention and ongoing mistreatment has sort of been diluted so what's happened instead is that the elevation of perceptions has been elevated that this doesn't always work what happens you really decided to help victims but it often just leads to people digging their heels in now the a Productivity Commission Claire estimates bullying cost us almost thirty six billion dollars average of claims twenty four thousand dollars psychological disputes that look longest and most prolonged now the realities there's always going to be a tension between say profit productivity and the welfare of workers now that's why often bullying claims occur around performance management processes but the growth industry and anti-bullying programs has the potential to do more harm than good especially if perceptions continue to be given a priority there's a limit to the management imperative on say human resources and psychosocial risk at this time last year former Australian pod to Jeff Kennett of NGO mental health NGO beyondblue said management performance bonuses should be linked to the emotional well-being of workers there's also been announcement recently that teacher teachers in Australia will be trained in mental health to see it early in their kids now I don't necessarily disagree with that but it shows you there's a bigger expectation now institutions to be kind of almost therapists if you like but in reality a lot of mental codes reflect wider changes you know you've got the rise in individual self fulfillment as being the kind of goal of our lives and might decline a lot of collective institutions family community religion that often complains out at work because works the biggest marker of our status and identity for men and women and also the rise of the service economies in in Western societies also puts a greater pressure on self presentation we're all there trying to project our best selves but that can actually make us more brittle now behavior it worked it really chose us as kind of these advanced primates sort of fighting out sort of dances of dominance and aggression all through email meetings and open-plan offices now employees have a duty to maintain a safe workplace but this shouldn't go to the burden of sort of monitoring the psychic parameters of their employees now there are wider social currents that have made us more sensitive to the prospect of psychological harm and really employers to not be held responsible I'm Tami Roman if you liked this video subscribe to rebel media you
