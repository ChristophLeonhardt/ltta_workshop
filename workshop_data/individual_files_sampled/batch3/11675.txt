they feel it from their own country from their own Russian citizens but what I out think too is that they will be united they will be together for to officially the manager create a bubble around them they are together they have their principles of play but fundamentally I feel they are going to be a United team in the sense of in the sense of the world they want to do it for themselves they want to do for their country and in this moment they feel what I call the good pressure is good you need that little bit of adrenaline you need that little bit of a fire on your body in your brain that push you for for high performance levels without that not possible as a manager Josie is it more difficult to prepare your players mentally than it is physically because you can't actually see inside their heads candy but you can see physically whether they're running well out of breath or whatever but is it difficult to replace normally is by the mental point of view that that you have the positive and the negative surprises because the way players are preferred nowadays there is no problem at all about their physical condition there is no problem at all because the managers they prepare the team well enough by the tactical point of view they know how to play they know what to do the mental situation is more individual and then you have to deal with the characters with the personalities that Indian can make a difference you need people for not to be relaxed you need the people for not to be and a huge pressure you need people to be just in that in that edge where you are ready to give everything but you are ready to be happy to be there and I think that's fundamental for for players and managers in these occasions they have to be happy to be there they have to to feel that is their natural habitat so hopefully we get the goods it would be immunized but of course they will feel both sides expression fascinating well let's check on the mental state of fans shall we - because we've got Alexa Guerra chef ski he's down he's down at the Luzhniki stadium for us Alexei hi there it feels incredible to be sharing the airwaves with you both gentlemen just as it feels incredible to actually realize what's going on here seven and a half years ago on a cold December night on December 3rd and I know this is dead very well because it was 24 hours before I actually got married I was standing here reporting on Russia's bid for the World Cup 2018 not one soul among our crew not one soul in the press believed that we would actually get it and now it's becoming reality it says right here on the Luzhniki stadium the World Cup 2018 FIFA in Russia the atmosphere here is absolutely electrifying a lot of fans it's something close to four hours before the kickoff of the first game but it's already crammed with fans I just took a train to the Luzhniki area and it felt like I was joining a global party on that train German Spanish French Arabic on just one car of that train different languages different mix and that's what it's all about obviously the World Cup so for the last several days the city has been filled with fans from all over the world if you're feeling down for any reason just go to the Red Square area you can see for yourself everywhere right Saudi Arabia the guys are optimistic guys are optimistic right you can see that energy here but yesterday I went in the streets of Moscow and if you want to see more of that energy check out my high energy report from the Red Square breaking news Moscow has been taken over by friendly forces meaning fans from all over the world and I'm here on a mission chanting is part of football culture and I want to learn chants from different parts of the world I don't know exactly what these guys are chanting usually but I know the channel will make them happy guys masala I'm on a mission can you teach me any of the Egyptian chance in a circle promise stuff drop-off and stuff I wonder what they will be chanting tonight Peruvian fans in Moscow have one of the largest representations so you see the atmosphere it's absolutely mental now in the streets of Moscow and it will obviously continue for the next 30 days yeah sure thanks alexei that was Alexia chefs key forest and illusion League Josie you've really got a sense of the excitement is building here haven't you in Moscow just looking at that report you're not just here as a manager as a pundit you're here is a fan - aren't you for Portugal how are you feeling about tomorrow's game down in Sochi against Spain I feel that we can win we can lose and there's a fan you are right as a fan I wouldn't be in hell if we lose against Spain but I will not also be in heaven if you beat Spain I think we both are going to qualify because we are two of the strongest teams in the competition and the match tomorrow I think anything can happen we we Portugal we feel confident enough to play against Spain and try to win but I know that's been with the quality in the class of the players they have they also feel confident that they can beat anyone so I think can be one of the best matches of the group phase because we are speaking about two very good teams it is the biggest of the bunch isn't it at the moment what did you make of the fact that Spain sacked their manager yesterday just two days before this match you know I think it's a strange situation I don't know if Spain sacked the manager or if the manager set himself with the way everything happened between himself and and Real Madrid I feel sorry for the manager of course because the he went with the team for the last two years and of course you would deserve to be with the team but I also understand the position of them of the Federation they just gave him a new contract for the future if he's through what I read because nowadays you read so many things that are not true but if he through what I read that the president of the Federation was informed a couple of minutes before the club makes official is a strange process what I feel is that is a national team with such such a quality and such a maturity and such an understanding the majority of the players belong to Real Madrid too Barcelona with some top class players with the philosophy of play that comes since Lizarraga has so many years and then the bosc is so many years so I think the fact that is not la pedagogy on the bench and this fernando hierro honestly i don't think he's going to make a huge difference because the place they pick themselves they are so good the team is so good that team is so automatic that I don't think is a huge huge problem for them okay well let's see what some of the fans think sure we can go to Sochi now I think Kate Partridge is down in Sochi for us if we can get a connection okay good afternoon josée we say Mady hello Jo same is saying there he doesn't think the Spanish team will be affected by events over the last front of 48 hours so how are the fans down there what's the feeling or the feeling sorry Andy all I can say is hot hot hot it's 30 degrees here at the Black Sea resort and it's another beautiful day here the fans they've just started to arrive we just actually were at the hotel where the Spanish team have come in they're actually based in Krasnodar but they're coming in obviously ahead of that now more than ever crunch game against Portugal and the fans as I say they've gradually started to arrive here we can see a few of them outside of the hotel obviously wanting to greet their heroes but in the meantime let's tell you a little bit about what sorry is really like I was totally surprised by I remember it as the 2014 Winter Olympic venue I remember it for the mountains I remember it for all the skiing events I remember it for all the medals but when you actually get here this time round what you do see apart from the Sun and also the sea and also what you can see behind me the fish stadium that was the the venue for the opening and closing ceremonies for the Olympics but of course will be the scene then for that crunch game that group B game between Portugal and Spain that's one of four group matches here as well as the last 16 and quarterfinal game you can't actually see it but we really are on the edge of the Black Sea literally a hundred metres behind the stadium is the beachfront it's all pebbles the sea is very clear it's beautiful and along it as well there are or there are bars there are restaurants there are places to go and tonight well we were asking about obviously doing research we could see what the fans would get a sample of it's a really quite gorgeous place there's also a theme park called Saatchi Park which is further along the way so plenty to see and do I mean if you look behind me here you can see the fish stadium also you can see that thing sticking out that was the Olympic flame and last night that was lit up with fountains and music was playing here in the Olympic Park which is a gorgeous park surrounded by all those arenas that we learned about at those Sochi games and the fans at the moment Russian but a few more Spanish and Portuguese fans arriving here getting a taste of what it's going to be like hearing Sachi and if it continues with the matches in the same way that the temperature has been it's going to be a cracker okay thanks Kate Kate Partridge there for a sir in Sochi tomorrow night josée we'll get our first glimpse of Ronaldo yeah Portugal I know in your predictions when you were making them you said because of him Portugal have a chance of winning this World Cup why is he so important because the best players in the world big they can make the difference I'm not saying they make I'm saying they can make the difference and everybody knows that for the last decades Ronaldo and Messi they were the two best players in in the planet they did amazingly well for the clubs they tried and of course Portugal won in the Europe but they try to give the best of them to their countries and I think they both arrived in this world probably as the last one you think this is their last chance when a welcome I don't see of course Cristiano by the physical point of view is is in our Superman and it can if he wants but four more years at the highest level to come back to the next World Cup I feel it I feel it hard of course Donnell is is younger and he can he can perfectly be in the next World Cup in four years time but I would also sync that to play every week to three matches per week Barcelona Real Madrid's La Liga champions league national team I think to to resist to all of that and four years later to come at the highest level I think hard to so I think they are going both to put everything in this in this World Cup to try to try to finish their careers with the only thing that they don't have because no one is is a world champion and of course the careers they they are having as club players to be worked watch anything is being the pinnacle of their career car makes it both eliminations we'll see ya Lionel Messi wrote me on Saturday here in Moscow and is Argentina play Iceland of course they're not the only two that are superstars at this World Cup in fact we can take a look at some others okay well some smaller teams have got some big names in their teams - haven't they they've got to sit down as moon for example is playing for RAM tomorrow he's up against Morocco in some Petersburg and I think we can go to our reporter there Easter Ally who's a amongst the fans to give us a taste of the mood their recent yes here in st. Petersburg everyone's looking forward to that first game tomorrow Iran against Morocco we can have a little breakdown of those two teams two very tight well organized offensive teams you have the Iranian team led of course by the Portuguese coach Carlos karashi led them to the last World Cup in Brazil in 2014 and again leading them this time round and in their qualifying they were very good defensively conceding only once in their ten qualifying games and although not the most perhaps attacking team also only scoring 10 in those games and they have their star player asada as moon he actually plays here in Russia for Rubin Kazan and he's somebody who's been dubbed the Iranian Messi and they'll be going up against Morocco of course another team with a very good defensive record and their final qualifying group they played six games and only it actually didn't concede a goal their defense being led by you ventus's Metis benattia so expect tomorrow's game to be tight not too many goals although I say that it will probably end up being a formal draw and there should be a really good game to get things kicked off here in st. Petersburg my mother's Iranian so I'm not going to pretend to not be very biased throughout the course of this whole tournament but actually here in st. Petersburg with regards to the fans and on the way here even in the airport as we were flying in there were Moroccan and Iranian fans in the airport during the stopover all singing songs and chanting songs at each other but all in very good nature and we've seen a number of supporters walking around the city today so amazing atmosphere not just fans from Iran of Morocco we've seen Colombian fans Argentinian fans were real festival football with people all around the world getting to know each other learn about each other's cultures and just enjoy what should be a month of fascinating football okay thanks that was Lisa rally for us there up in st. Petersburg I'm Jay Z I know you've got to head down to the luge Aniki shortly and before kickoff we've got the opening ceremony and there's a chap playing you've managed I understand robbie williams he played in the charity match once and you were the manager yeah that was a couple of famous is he any good as a player as a footballer he's lucky that he's a phenomenal singer a phenomenal artist because he wouldn't break alive in the career in football but what is is an amazing guy we'd love for the game and especially love for children in trouble and that's why it gets involved in in charity matches playing organizing but fundamentally is is a very funny a very happy guy in love with with life and with great affection for children in in trouble that's why when when you say is please Josie I always try to just say yes okay look Jose I been great talking to you over the last half-hour so go enjoy the match tonight I know you're coming back to us to talk more about how it went for the moment though we're going to leave you as well you're watching our special coverage here of the World Cup in our lofty studio overlooking Red Square we've got reporters all over the country to keep you covered we're going to be back in a few hours time with more build-up to the opening match Russia against Saudi Arabia five minute
