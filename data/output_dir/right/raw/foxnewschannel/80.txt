1
00:00:01,488 --> 00:00:01,854
BRIAN.

2
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:02,922
BRIAN: LET'S GO TO THIS.

3
00:00:02,923 --> 00:00:04,657
THIS MORNING THE CARAVAN OF

4
00:00:04,658 --> 00:00:05,792
MIGRANTS PUSHING CLOSER TO

5
00:00:05,793 --> 00:00:06,959
THE UNITED STATES OF

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,527
AMERICA.

7
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:10,029
RIGHT TO OUR BORDER.

8
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,564
DESPITE MEXICAN AUTHORITIES

9
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:12,165
SUPPOSE SUPPOSED BEST

10
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,299
EFFORTS TO STOP THEM.

11
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,002
OUR NEXT GUEST WHO LEGALLY

12
00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:18,037
IMMIGRATED TO AMERICA FROM

13
00:00:18,038 --> 00:00:18,971
NICARAGUA IS CALLING THIS

14
00:00:18,972 --> 00:00:20,373
CARAVAN A TOTAL INVASION.

15
00:00:20,374 --> 00:00:22,275
CALLING IT AN ACT OF WAR.

16
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:24,477
HERE TO EXPLAIN HANS BURGER,

17
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:25,611
FOUNDER OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS

18
00:00:25,612 --> 00:00:27,413
FOR AMERICA.

19
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:29,282
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ACT OF WAR?

20
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:30,917
I THOUGHT WE WERE SUPPOSED

21
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:32,952
TO OPEN UP OUR ARMS AND HAVE

22
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:33,352
COMPASSION?

23
00:00:33,353 --> 00:00:38,157
>> WELL, THE VARY CAN IS --

24
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:39,859
ACT OF WAR WHICH IS DEFINED

25
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,630
AS AN ACT OF AGGRESSION BY A

26
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:46,933
COUNTRY WHICH CONSTITUTES AN

27
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:50,803
IMMEDIATE THREAT TOE PIECE.

28
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:52,972
AND I -- IMMEDIATE THREAT TO

29
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:55,541
NATIONAL SECURITY.

30
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:56,943
BRIAN: NOW YOU ARE A LEGAL

31
00:00:56,944 --> 00:00:57,310
IMMIGRANT.

32
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:59,245
YOU CAME FROM NICARAGUA.

33
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:00,713
>> YES.

34
00:01:00,714 --> 00:01:01,347
BRIAN: HOW DID YOU DO IT?

35
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:08,521
>> LEGALLY, I WENT TO THE

36
00:01:08,522 --> 00:01:09,922
EMBASSY, FILLED OUT FORMS.

37
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:10,990
SUBMITTED MYSELF TO THE

38
00:01:10,991 --> 00:01:12,291
VETTING PROCESSION AND

39
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:15,027
WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE

40
00:01:15,028 --> 00:01:16,195
EMBASSY TO APPROVE MY

41
00:01:16,196 --> 00:01:18,531
COMING.

42
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:21,367
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE SHOULD DO

43
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:21,701
IT.

44
00:01:21,702 --> 00:01:22,401
BRIAN: THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT

45
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:23,669
WAITING FOR THAT WHY ARE

46
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,937
THEY COMING HERE AND WHO ARE

47
00:01:24,938 --> 00:01:25,238
THEY?

48
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:28,374
>> I BELIEVE THAT THEY

49
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,709
ARE -- WE DO NOT KNOW.

50
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,210
BUT THEY ARE A THREAT TO OUR

51
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:35,047
NATIONAL SECURITY BECAUSE

52
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:38,618
TODAY WAR IS NOT ONLY

53
00:01:38,619 --> 00:01:40,586
COUNTRIES THAT GO TO WAR, IT

54
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:44,724
IS GROUPS, SUCH AS ISIS.

55
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:46,292
HEZBOLLAH, HAMAS, THE

56
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:48,528
TALIBAN, AND THEY HAVE

57
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:49,662
DECLARED WAR OPENLY AGAINST

58
00:01:49,663 --> 00:01:53,733
THE UNITED STATES.

59
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:54,634
SO, WITH THE OPEN BORDERS

60
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:55,768
POLICIES WE HAVE HAD.

61
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:57,270
HOW MANY OF THEM ARE IN

62
00:01:57,271 --> 00:01:57,637
AMERICA?

63
00:01:57,638 --> 00:02:00,873
THAT'S THE QUESTION.

64
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:01,307
BRIAN: RIGHT.

65
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:02,008
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED THIS

66
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:02,275
OUT.

67
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,709
A CARAVANS ARE A DISGRACE TO

68
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,510
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

69
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:05,845
CHANGE THE IMMIGRATION LAWS

70
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:06,178
NOW.

71
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:07,146
YOU POINT OUT, TOO.

72
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:10,416
THE CARAVAN ORGANIZERS ARE A

73
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:10,750
PROBLEM.

74
00:02:10,751 --> 00:02:12,018
AND BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING

75
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:14,420
FROM COUNTRIES IN HONDURAS,

76
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:15,421
FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS NUMBER

77
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:17,657
ONE IN THE WORLD IN

78
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:18,024
HOMICIDES.

79
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:18,958
EL SALVADOR IS NUMBER 4,

80
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,561
GUATEMALA IS NUMBER 5.  JUST

81
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,262
ON STATISTICAL PURPOSES JUST

82
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:24,830
RUNNING THE STATS.

83
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:25,865
SABER METRICS.

84
00:02:25,866 --> 00:02:27,567
THIS DOESN'T LOOK AS THOUGH,

85
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:29,101
WE ARE ACTUALLY CAUSING

86
00:02:29,102 --> 00:02:30,303
OURSELVES SOME SECURITY

87
00:02:30,304 --> 00:02:34,540
ISSUES BY ALLOWING 5 TO

88
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:39,412
7,000 WE DON'T KNOW IN.

89
00:02:39,413 --> 00:02:40,313
45,000 WILL BE COMING NEXT?

90
00:02:40,314 --> 00:02:40,913
>> YES.

91
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:42,081
I BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBERS

92
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:43,983
INCREASE EVERY TIME THEY

93
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:47,086
COME IN SUCCESSFULLY AND AT

94
00:02:47,087 --> 00:02:50,356
WHAT POINT ARE WE GOING TO

95
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:55,528
CALL THEM -- CALL THE

96
00:02:55,529 --> 00:02:57,363
ORGANIZER COMMITTING AN ACT

97
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:58,164
OF WAR?

98
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:00,700
IS IT 40,000 WHEN THEY BRING

99
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:05,004
IN 40,000 STRANGERS?

100
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,505
BRIAN: WHAT IS THE MESSAGE

101
00:03:06,506 --> 00:03:07,373
INSIDE NICARAGUA?

102
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:08,474
WHY DO THEY FEEL THEY CAN

103
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,977
COME HERE OR HONDURAS?

104
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:11,611
WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY

105
00:03:11,612 --> 00:03:13,179
FEEL LIKE THE FLOOD GATES

106
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,813
ARE OPEN?

107
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:14,280
WHAT HAPPENED?

108
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:15,948
>> I BELIEVE THEY ARE

109
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:20,820
ENTICED BY PEOPLE THAT FUND

110
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,154
THEIR CARAVAN WITH MONEY.

111
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:23,522
THEY ARE INSTRUCTED WHAT TO

112
00:03:23,523 --> 00:03:23,789
SAY.

113
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,991
WHAT TO DO.

114
00:03:24,992 --> 00:03:26,325
THEY ARE ALSO BRAINWASHED

115
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:29,128
INTO BELIEVING THEY BELONG

116
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,032
IN THE UNITED STATES OF

117
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:34,066
AMERICA AND THAT THEY HAVE

118
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:35,167
RIGHTS TO COME IN AND ASK

119
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,970
FOR BENEFITS.

120
00:03:37,971 --> 00:00:00,000
BRIAN: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
