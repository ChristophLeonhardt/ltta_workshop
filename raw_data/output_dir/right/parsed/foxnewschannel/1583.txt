EVERYTHING WENT JUST WHITE.
>> Martha: NOTHING FURTHER.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
>> Martha: BORN OUT OF MY
EXCLUSIVE SIT DOWN THIS
AFTERNOON WITH VICE PRESIDENT
MIKE PENCE AND A FASCINATING
LOOK AT OUR FUTURE RATE
RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAN.
AND NEW QUESTIONS TONIGHT, IF
THIS WHITE HOUSE IS URGING THE
PEOPLE OF IRAN TO PUSH OUT THE
AYATOLLAH.
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO
IS NOW THREATENING IRAN WITH
NORTH KOREA-STYLE SANCTIONS.
I ASKED VICE PRESIDENT PENCE
ABOUT THAT.
>> Martha: WITH REGARD TO
IRAN, SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO
TODAY TWEETED TO THE IRANIAN
PEOPLE REALLY, DO YOU WANT YOUR
COUNTRY TO BE KNOWN AS
COCONSPIRATOR WITH HEZBOLLAH,
HAMAS, THE TALIBAN.
THE PRESIDENT A COUPLE WEEKS AGO
SAID RECLAIM YOUR HERITAGE.
IS THIS ADMINISTRATION
ENCOURAGING REBELLION ON THE
PART OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLE TO
PUSH BACK AGAINST THAT REGIME
AND THAT LEADERSHIP?
>> I THINK WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
HAS MADE CLEAR, AND YOU'RE THE
SECRETARY MAKE CLEAR TODAY IS
THAT WE ARE WITH THE PEOPLE OF
IRAN.
YOU ACTUALLY SAW DEMONSTRATIONS
ALL OVER IRAN DURING THE LAST
YEARS.
YOU REMEMBER THE GREEN
REVOLUTION OF JUST A FEW SHORT
YEARS AGO THAT WAS PUT DOWN BY
THE AYATOLLAHS.
THE PEOPLE OF IRAN DESERVE
BETTER THAN A REGIME THAT
SPONSORS TERRORISM ACROSS THE
REGION.
THE PEOPLE OF IRAN DESERVE
BETTER THAN A REGIME THAT
CONTINUES TO FOCUS --
>> Martha: IN WHAT WAY WOULD
WE ATE THAT OR HELP THAT OR
ENCOURAGE THAT?
WHAT WOULD WE DO?
>> IT WOULD ALL BEGIN BY
WITHDRAWING FROM THE IRAN
NUCLEAR DEAL AND MAKING IT CLEAR
THAT WE ARE NO LONGER GOING TO
ABIDE AN AGREEMENT THAT THE
FOCUS WAS ULTIMATELY TO DELAY
IRAN FROM OBTAINING A NUCLEAR
WEAPON FOR A PERIOD OF TEN
YEARS.
THE REALITY IS THE UNDERLYING
PROMISE WAS THAT IRAN WOULD
ABANDON THEIR SUPPORT OF
TERRORISM, THEIR MALIGN
ACTIVITIES ACROSS THE REGION
WITH GROUPS LIKE HEZBOLLAH,
HAMAS, DESTABILIZING ACTIVITIES
IN PLACES LIKE SYRIA AND YEMEN,
AND THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE
HAS HAPPENED.
IRAN IS DOING MORE TODAY IN THE
REGION TO SUPPORT TERRORISM AND
TO SUPPORT VIOLENCE THAN THEY
DID BEFORE THE JCPOA WAS SIGNED.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS MADE IT
CLEAR THAT WE ARE OUT OF THE
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND WE ARE
CALLING ON OUR ALLIES ACROSS
EUROPE TO JOIN WITH US IN A
NEGOTIATION OVER A NEW AGREEMENT
THAT WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
PERMANENTLY BANNING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS THAT DEALS WITH IRAN'S
INFLUENCE IN PLACES LIKE YEMEN
AND OF COURSE SYRIA.
DEALS WITH BALLISTIC MISSILES
AND ULTIMATELY WILL PUT
