1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,980
the declaration of support for United
Nations reform began as a way to give

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,599
momentum to secretary-general Guterres
efforts to bring greater efficiency

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,660
accountability and transparency to the
UN we thought that having member states

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,770
put their names on a document would help
ensure that these goals don't remain

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:25,470
just words but become a part of the
culture of the UN the response that

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,759
we've had has been nothing short of
fantastic 128 nations have signed on to

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,190
the declaration as of this morning and
we're still counting that is a

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,430
supermajority I thank our co-hosts today
our friends from Canada Germany

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:54,480

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,840
committed to sing the United Nations

12
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,210
only that change is desperately needed
but that it will be achieved you were

13
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,610
the reason change is coming to the UN it
is now my honor to introduce someone who

14
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,920
is no stranger to change Donald Trump
has a business man's eye for seeing

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,470
potential and he sees great potential
not just in this reform movement but in

16
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,320
the United Nations itself he shares your
commitment to creating a more effective

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,820
advocate for peace security and human
rights we are deeply grateful he has

18
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,159
taken the time to be with us today
ladies and gentlemen president Donald J

19
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:55,220
Trump well thank you very much thank you
I actually saw a great potential right

20
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,660
across the street to be honest with you
and it was only for the reason that the

21
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:04,790
United Nations was here that that turned
out to be such a successful project so I

22
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,820
want to thank you ambassador Haley for
your introduction and for your steadfast

23
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:16,430
advocacy for American interests on the
world stage on behalf of the co-host

24
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,920
countries I would like to also thank
secretary-general GU turis for and you

25
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,980
have been fantastic for joining us and
we affirm our commitment to the United

26
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,620
Nations reform and reform is what we're
talking about I applaud the

27
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,930
secretary-general for laying out a
vision to reform the United Nations so

28
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,640
that it better serves the people we all
represent we support your efforts to

29
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,709
look across the entire system and to
find ways the United Nations can better

30
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:56,959
and be better at development management
peace and security the United Nations

31
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,019
was founded on truly noble goals
these include affirming the dignity and

32
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:09,530
worth of the human person and striving
for international peace the United

33
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,850
Nations has helped advance toward these
goals in so many ways feeding the hungry

34
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:22,580
providing disaster relief and empowering
women and girls and many societies all

35
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:28,519
across the world yet in recent years the
United Nations has not reached its full

36
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,980
potential because of bureaucracy and
mismanagement while the United Nations

37
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,130
on a regular budget has increased by 140
percent and its staff has more than

38
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:47,390
doubled since 2000 we are not seeing the
results in line with this investment but

39
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,640
I know that under the secretary-general
that's changing and it's changing fast

40
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,540
and we've seen it that's why we commend
the secretary-general and is call for

41
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,990
the United Nations to focus more on
people

42
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:09,620
and less on bureaucracy we seek a United
Nations that regains the trust of the

43
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,000
people around the world in order to
achieve this the United Nations must

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,620
hold every level of management
accountable protect whistleblowers and

45
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:25,580
focus on results rather than on process
to honor the people of our nations we

46
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,440
must ensure that no one and no member
state shoulders

47
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,220
a disproportionate share of the burden
and that's militarily or financially we

48
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,320
also ask that every peacekeeping mission
have clearly defined goals and metrics

49
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,850
for evaluating success they deserve to
see the value in the United Nations and

50
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:55,700
it is our job to show it to them we
encourage the secretary-general to fully

51
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,410
use his authority to cut through the
bureaucracy reform outdated systems and

52
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,560
make firm decisions to advance the UN's
core mission further we encourage all

53
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,350
Member States to look at ways to take
bold stands at the United Nations with

54
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:19,880
an eye toward changing business as usual
and not being beholden to ways of the

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,750
past which were not working mr.
secretary-general the United States and

56
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:35,480
the member states present today support
this great reform vision we pledge to be

57
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,950
partners in your work and I am confident
that if we work together and champion

58
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,940
truly bold reforms the United Nations
will emerge as a stronger more effective

59
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:53,060
more just in greater force for peace and
harmony in the world Thank You mr.

60
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,760
secretary-general and I look forward to
advancing the shared goals in the years

61
00:05:58,760 --> 00:00:00,000
to come and it is a great honor to be
with you today thank you
