I'm as relevant it's May 9th and you're watching battleground hey everybody Ezra Levant here we call this the super chat every weekday from 12:00 noon Eastern to 1:00 p.m. I do a live chitchat and we call a super chat because on the side of the screen you can make any live comment and I'll read them and I'll reply and if you chip in a couple bucks the comment is put in a colorful highlight and I see out of the corner of my eye and immediately read it and it's also a nice way to help our company go because of course we don't receive any government funding today however I cannot stick around I actually am recording this yesterday even though we're running a lot to have a funeral but I wanted to say hello and please come back tomorrow because we do intend to do this every weekday so I announce this on yesterday's show but I'm just saying this again for people who missed it I want to show you a fun video being either got a lot of videos at the realm Shelagh gonna read Dave Menzies I want to show you a couple of videos from around other parts for the ripple world empire your folks in Hollywood we got folks from Florida we got folks let me show you another video take a look the Alberta Teachers Association wants the government of Alberta to tell journalists hug report on provincial exam results I'd like the Alberta government to tell these teachers about this little thing called the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that protects the Free Press but I suspect neither group has all that great of a grasp on it the Alberta Teachers Association or the ATA is calling upon the Alberta government to make reporters follow the recommendations of the Canadian Psychological Association when reporting on provincial exam results now this is the motion here from the ATA Executive it reads the failure on the part of the press to acknowledge the many other factors other than schooling that are known to influence test performance is misleading and damaging to the integrity of teacher professionalism and student well-being be it resolved that the Teachers Association urged the Department of Education to encourage the media to adhere to the joint positions statement by the Canadian Psychological Association and the Canadian Association of School Psychologists on the Canadian Press coverage of the province wide achievement test results in reporting and interpreting diploma examination results school awarded marks and achievement test results now the recommendations of the Canadian Psychological Association include having journalists who are reporting on exam results use a full disclaimer in their articles this is a recommendation here as a further means of avoiding any misunderstanding on the part of the public we recommend that a note similar to the following should appear in a prominent position together with any school by school breakdown of results because children are not randomly assigned to schools it is impossible to determine the cause of any differences in test results that occur between schools without access to further information although this newspaper publishes the following results as a service to the public we strongly discourage the public from making unwarranted comparisons that may lead to erroneous conclusions are these people out of their minds the ATA says that the failure of the press to acknowledge other factors other than schooling teaching really is misleading and mijung to the integrity of teacher professionalism and student well-being but I think that's probably a pretty disingenuous excuse teachers demanding that the government tell journalists how to do their jobs is damaging to teacher professionalism since it demonstrates an extreme lack of understanding of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Free Press but there's something else at play here Alberta test results are tumbling they are sinking like a stone across the whole province an international grade for aptitude test taken in 2015 showed Alberta students scoring an average of 484 in math that's a 40 point drop since 1995 but it's also a very drastic recent drop the average score in 2005 was 505 and it was 507 in 2011 then Along Came discovery math and our numbers tanked in Edmonton according to the results of the provincial achievement tests the percentage of grade 6 students who are meeting the acceptable standard for math has dropped consistently since 2014 in Calgary students are falling even further behind the provincial average here's what I think is happening those provincial achievement tests for grade 6 math are coming up again this month and next month and so the teachers union is just trying to cover their asses as they know bad results are going to continue to roll in for their crazy curriculum update there's been an sjw teaching focus and a lack of real consequences for failing teachers even as math and general aptitude scores continue to decline the teachers union continues to make demands for more salary something we would absolutely never see happen in the private sector if you're not doing your job or you're doing your job poorly you certainly wouldn't get a raise then would you and do the teachers union cronies really think that we don't know that kids and schools are different there have always been different socioeconomic classes in education there have always been poor kids hungry kids affluent kids and schools that serve these different demographics in different neighborhoods all across the country why is the teachers union pretending like income inequality is suddenly a new situation here in Canada and actually this idea that different socioeconomic demographics are driving this change in educational outcomes is really just you know a garbage excuse stats can data from 2015 shows that there were 1.2 million children across Canada living in low-income households but the share of low-income population that our children has decreased faster than any other demographic in Canada so the teachers unions need to come up with a different excuse for why they are failing our kids these falling test results for school-aged children are only going to harm the Canadian economy and the future of these school kids are going to be damned to struggle for the rest of their lives researchers at Princeton Educational Testing Service analyzed American Millennials the first group of kids who were subject to these new trends in education the researchers found that American Millennials fall short in the skills employers want most literacy practical math and problem solving in technology rich environments Alberta's teachers unions would rather ask their pals in the NDP government to try to control the media rather than teach kids the basics effectively and I would not be surprised at the freedom-hating NDP obliged them but what would we expect from a union that paid David Suzuki who once called for the jailing of people he disagreed with somewhere between 30 to $50,000 to speak to them at their convention maybe the teachers union would benefit from having an economist rather than a fake scientist speak to them at their conventions for the rebel media I'm Shiela gun read so that's from elsewhere on the rebel just a reminder to folks who are tuning in right now unfortunately I can't be here in real life today because I have to go to a funeral I will be back tomorrow but because you took the time to join I want to show you one more video from elsewhere in the rebel world empire just because you took the time to join us so here's another video of some of the other stuff we are doing what is it with Democrats and freaky violent sexual perversions that get them kicked out of office or make them lose their jobs well the most recent Democrat to go down in a disgraceful ball of fire is none other than New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman now this is the guy who had been cooperating with Robert Muller to try to take down Team Trump out of some political grievance because of course the President of the United States can't pardon state-level crime so Muller was sharing information with this disgusting pervert you try to take out team Trump good Muller's federal investigation fail if you haven't seen the news on Schneiderman that broke late yesterday he was forced to resign in disgrace after four women accused him of beating them typically during sex and after he was drunk one of the women who's a bit darker skinned is a longtime mistress said he forced her to call him master and he would call her his brown slave and she had to tell him she was his property if she didn't do it he would beat her pretty severely choking her until he cut off her airway other women said that he'd merely hit on them and when they rejected his advances he smacked them so hard in the face with an open hand that they had a welt for days this guy was the Attorney General of New York State living out and he still is until close of business today living out these perverse sexual fantasies by beating women by beating women this The New Yorker broke the story and here are some of the excerpts from her let me find a for it said it closed something on my screen there now this guy remember Eric Schneiderman big liberal champion of the hashtag me too movement while he's beating women without their consent these women are just their stories are horrific now die Derman issued a very unbelievable statement let's put it that way Kim B I don't believe this for a second he said quote in the privacy of intimate relationships I have engaged in role-playing and other consensual sexual activity I have not assaulted anyone I have never engaged in non-consensual sex which is a line I would not cross and the women aren't aren't alleging that he raped them no they're saying that he would become more sexually aroused if he beat them without their consent and and their stories are here she hears one woman excuses after about four weeks a woman named Manning barish that she began to see signs of controlling and abusive behavior doing after she started dating Nider men he had her remove a tattoo from her wrist he was she said he was trying to control her by quote taking a strong woman and tearing her to pieces in his Jam after they became physically involved sexual I guess he became violent she says one night they were in the bedroom of his Upper West Side apartment still clothed but getting ready for bed and lightly beating each other flirting as she recalls that he then called her a whore she talked back they had both been drinking a recollection in the conversation she says his blurry but what happened next remains vivid item and she says backed her up to the edge of his bed and all of a sudden just slapped her is it her quotes all of a sudden he just slapped me open handed with great force across the face landing a blow directly onto my ear it was horrendous it just came out of nowhere my ear was ringing I lost my balance and fell backward onto the bed I sprang up but at this point there was very little room between the bed and him I got up to try to shove him back or take a swing he pushed me back down he then used his bodyweight to hold me down and began to choke me the choking was very hard it was really bad I kicked in every fiber I felt that was being beaten by a man end quote that she was crying and in shock now her stories mirror those of the three other women the novelist summon Rushdie who also dated this same woman before Schneiderman did and they remained close friends says that she confided this to him and the version she's telling today comports with the version she told him when it happened so it's a believable story these women are not alleging that they were sexually abused they're not out there looking for money these are all established women in their own right this woman Manning bearish very successful the other woman who was forced to call him master Harvard Graduate so these are not women looking for a payday they do fine in their own right these allegations are coming from some very credible from some very credible sources now this woman Manning bearish said she sought medical help from dr. Gwen her oven an ear nose and throat specialist and she shared her medical record with the new yorker the medical records confirm that the doctor removed dried bloody crust pretty bad visual from her ear and she thought the slap might've caused the injury but when Korriban asked her would happen he said she might have injured herself with a q-tip the woman batting bearish claims she was protecting night ermine and she was ashamed korban was asked the doctor was asked by the new yorker if the injury could have been caused by a slap and she said yes it could have been consistent with a slap with a q-tip or a slap and so inconclusive but the account of the event I always tell you timeline is everything an investigation the account of the event the date of the event when should i Derman supposedly physically abused this woman in relation to when she went to the doctor and there were signs of a recent injury in her ear from an evidentiary perspective support her claim and it wouldn't be the first woman who lied to a doctor lied to police because they were ashamed about being assaulted or they were afraid of the perpetrator and they wanted to protect them believe me wouldn't be the first might be the last it's more common than the victims who initially come forward in many respects especially when the guy is very powerful now that's the bigger problem here you've got an incredibly powerful person in the Attorney General or Attorney General of New York Remender relationships around the country politically know all the Wall Street power brokers so don't want to get on their bad side these women were terrified these women were terrified and and the stories go on and on and on I mean this guy was a serial sadistic physical abuser still is what a bad guy I mean what a terrible terrible guy now this is um Eric Schneiderman is just one in a long list of political scandals in New York the New York Times that his story the many faces of New York political scandals going back a decade over thirty thirty a current or former state office holders in New York have been convicted of crimes sanctioned or otherwise de cused of wrongdoing they put thirty of them up there of the 30 25 are Democrat 25 are Democrat lucas tells me how many Hall is alive and well in New York but this Schneiderman case is particularly bad in light of all of these other allegations that I'm going to tell you all about and in the fact that neither Minh was cooperating with robert muller earlier in the segment was corrupt cooperating with robert muller to try to bring down members of team Trump in a way that would be impervious to federal pardon the presidential pardon hey welcome back I pre-recorded this yesterday actually because I had to go to a funeral today so I could not be here for our daily chat that we're doing every day from 12:00 and Eastern to 1:00 p.m. Eastern normally I would be here and take your live questions for an hour but I had to go to a funeral today but I wanted to say hello to those who join today and didn't hear my notice I'd be away when I mean today let me close with a third and final video from around the rabble just some fun stuff of what we do when it comes to cattle slaughtering procedures occurring in Atlantic Canada just what the Halal is going on in PEI earlier this year the CBC ran a glowing profile of a company called Atlantic beef products and this slaughterhouse is a success story it is the only slaughtering facility in Atlantic Canada it's not one of those high-volume buildings such as the ones you find in Western Canada but Atlantic definitely does serve a need for both local farmers and consumers and the CBC certainly thinks so embracing a diversity is our strength narrative the CBC story was headlined blessed beef a boon for Pei Company the story noted that many of the employees are Muslim newcomers to Canada which is fine but then there was a statement by the company CEO that created some controversy on the island namely Russ Maillard told the CBC that all cattle are slaughtered in the halal method even though the Muslim population on PEI is perhaps about two percent now the all halal statement is problematic for certain people who are not of the Muslim faith Sikhs for example are forbidden from eating food blessed by someone of another faith and many devout Christians have a problem with this - not sure where the atheist stand on this issue in an event Paul MacGregor of skips fish and chips in Summerside PEI took issue with the all halal policy as well and he did a cheeky Facebook marketing campaign in which he noted that his new burger is religion free in other words it is made with non-halal ingredients source from Macquarie's meats naturally MacGregor was condemned by the usual suspects for being a bigot for marketing his non-halal burger just check out a logic-defying story about MacGregor in something called carbonated TV the headline states Canadian restaurant flaunts bigotry with new religion free burger and check out this line of copy from the writer Sam Walker regarding McGregor's decision to go non-halal quote the reason for this preference apparently it has nothing to with the meat itself but how one company prioritizes creating meals everyone can eat including adherence to Islam end quote hey Sami what about all those other affirmation people from other faiths who are actually forbidden to eat Islamic blessed beef Sam sounds to me that you might suffer from Sica phobia gee who's the bigot now well I put in a call to CEO of Atlantic beef products Russ Maillard I wanted to ask why his company is 100% Hallel especially given the very tiny Muslim population on the island we had a long chat and maillard came across as being a really good guy now on the subject of halal slaughter maillard told me that the certification board his company deals with allows the animal to be stunned first he assured me that this is a far more humane way of ritualistic animal slaughter than halal classic if you will as for that other issue at hand namely the fact that his plant is 100% Hallel maillard dropped the bombshell he told me he was misquoted by the CBC and that it's only a single-digit percentage of cattle that are being slaughtered using the halal process well that changed everything because the story was no longer about Islanders having to eat halal beef source from Atlantic whether they wanted to or not no the story had now become how unnecessary controversy had been created because of sloppy journalism on the behalf of the CBC so I reached out to our state broadcaster to see if it planned to issue a correction or clarification and to its credit the CBC launched an investigation and a few days later CBC spokesman Chuck Thompson informed me that the CBC was standing by its story here's what Thompson said quote I heard back from my colleague Donna Logan with CBC News and PEI who spoke to mr. Maillard on Friday as I understand it the line you allege that was misquoted was now all the beef put through the plant are slaughtered in the halal tradition he said this was a paraphrase and not a direct quote but it was supported by the interview when it first happened and then again during Donna Logan's conversation on Friday with mr. Maillard mr. Maillard says that the line is accurate and he also says he didn't tell you that we misquoted him all of that to say we are standing by our story thanks for your patience end quote what well folks for starters have maillard had never said he was misquoted I never would have contacted the CBC in the first place so I reached out to Russ Maillard again and again and again over several days I called him more than probably a dozen times and left behind detailed voicemails not a single call back so I put in a call to the cattle producers Association of Prince Edward Island they told me the best source for information regarding my halal query was Bruce Andrews who is the procurement and logistics manager at Atlantic beef products so I called him to ask him just one simple question how much beef is produced via the halal method Andrews would say instead he advised me to call you guessed it CEO Russ Maillard now I follow through with a few more calls to Maillard until finally a colleague of Maillard told me he had nothing more to say on the matter and he would not be calling me back fortunately I was able to reach a cattle farmer on the island he didn't want his name used but he told me that to make everything more efficient all cows are indeed slaughtered the halal way at Atlantic beef products even though not all the beef products are labeled halal he said quote they Atlantic were excited about this halal slaughter and never saw a problem end quote the farmer told me that in its quest to embrace Sharia Atlantic never foresaw that certain people of other faiths might take exception to eating cattle that had been salat or but with an Islamic blessing but since Russ Maillard or anyone else working at Atlantic beef products won't return my phone calls let me state it publicly when it comes to halal slaughter which is it guys a small percentage or one hundred percent or something in between or is this a matter of Ross Maillard stating one stat that will play well to a CBC audience and another stat that is better suited for a rebel media audience miss Maillard with all due respect it's time to talk Turkey with the people of Prince Edward Island especially those who want to know what the halal is going on their dinner plate for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies my name is Katie Hopkins the biggest bitch in Britain according to some and guess what I'm breaking back in to Toronto to come and meet you in person from rebel eyes will you come and join me it's a top team that are going to be there and rebel contributors and hundreds of rebels for a brilliant one day conservative conference in Canada now I know conferences can be a bit dull name badges sake sandwiches but if ours doesn't make you want to stand up and shout hallelujah at least once in the day I will refund your ticket price for myself the brilliant Sheila Gunn read will be there she's a brave lady and Alberta's leader of the unofficial opposition rebel mission specialist David Menzies will be sharing his wisdom and even though he's kind of ginger he's like a really nice guy and we're thrilled that Islamic reformist and human rights activist Raheel Raza will be on team as well and my old mucker who makes me laugh a lot former NYPD cop and rebel host John Cardillo will be there and if that wasn't enough for you all the bearded wonder boy himself the official troublemaker in chief Gavin McGinnis will be taking center stage I love him don't tell him I said that your ticket price will include lunch and refreshments throughout the day as says the snacks are good that's the official 9 and the one thing I've realized about conservative conferences is that unlike liberals and Democrats when they come with emit their own sandals and socks our kind of people are just so much better dressed I look forward to seeing you there that Saturday the 2nd of June don't miss out get your ticket now go to the rebel live.com for special early bird ticket prices I look forward to seeing you in Toronto well that's it for today I had to pre-record this because I was out of town but I will be back in our world headquarters tomorrow Thursday at 12 min eastern time that's 10 a.m. mountain time for one hour of super chat until tomorrow on behalf of all of us here at rebel world headquarters keep fighting for freedom
