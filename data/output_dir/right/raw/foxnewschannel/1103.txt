1
00:00:00,787 --> 00:00:01,988
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU COULDN'T

2
00:00:01,988 --> 00:00:03,022
HAVE SCRIPTED IT.

3
00:00:03,022 --> 00:00:05,625
ALL RIGHT, KRISTIN FISHER,

4
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:06,159
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

5
00:00:06,159 --> 00:00:06,960
>> THANKS.

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,128
>> Shannon: A REPORT RELEASED

7
00:00:09,128 --> 00:00:11,030
BY SENATE REPUBLICANS TODAY SAYS

8
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,198
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

9
00:00:12,198 --> 00:00:13,833
DELIBERATELY MISLED THE PUBLIC

10
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:16,769
AND CONGRESS BY GRANTING A

11
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:21,407
IRAN TO ACCESS THE FINANCIAL

12
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:23,743
SYSTEM RIGHT HERE IN THE U.S. BY

13
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:24,344
SIDESTEPPING SANCTIONS.

14
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:25,044
FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS SAY IT

15
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:25,745
WAS ALL PART OF THE SPIRIT OF

16
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:26,746
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, PART OF

17
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:27,780
THE BENEFITS THEY PROMISED TO

18
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,148
IRAN.

19
00:00:29,148 --> 00:00:30,116
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE'S

20
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,651
PERMANENT SUBCOMMITTEE ON

21
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:32,317
INVESTIGATIONS, SENATOR ROB

22
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:33,052
PORTMAN, JOINED US NOT TO

23
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:34,387
DISCUSS THIS REPORT THAT HAS A

24
00:00:34,387 --> 00:00:36,389
LOT OF PEOPLE BY SURPRISE.

25
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:37,490
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

26
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,991
>> THANK YOU.

27
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:39,692
>> Shannon: WHAT WAS GOING ON

28
00:00:39,692 --> 00:00:40,159
HERE?

29
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:41,327
WHAT DID YOU UNCOVER?

30
00:00:41,327 --> 00:00:42,829
>> WE SPENT TWO YEARS LOOKING AT

31
00:00:42,829 --> 00:00:44,764
THIS, BECAUSE OF THE RUMORS THAT

32
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:46,399
THERE WAS SOME SORT OF A

33
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,200
SANCTIONS VIOLATION BY THE

34
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,634
ADMINISTRATION, THEY HAD ALLOWED

35
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:51,671
IRAN TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE

36
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:52,338
FINANCIAL SYSTEM.

37
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:53,406
WE JUST DID A LOT OF INTERVIEWS

38
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:54,774
AND TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND

39
00:00:54,774 --> 00:00:56,275
WERE ABLE TO GET EMAILS THAT

40
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:57,810
OTHERS HAD NOT RECEIVED, AND IT

41
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,612
BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT

42
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:00,847
HAPPENED WAS THE ADMINISTRATION

43
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:02,115
CHOSE TO MISLEAD CONGRESS, AND

44
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:04,349
MISLEAD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, BY

45
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,018
SAYING THEY ARE NOT GETTING

46
00:01:05,018 --> 00:01:06,386
ACCESS TO THE U.S. BANKS, THE

47
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:08,354
U.S. DOLLAR, THE U.S. FINANCIAL

48
00:01:08,354 --> 00:01:09,355
SYSTEM, WHEN IN FACT THEY

49
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:10,523
GRANTED THEM A SPECIFIC LICENSE

50
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:10,923
TO DO SO.

51
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:12,625
>> Shannon: WE WANT TO PLAY A

52
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,694
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT TWO TOP

53
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:16,929
TREASURY OFFICIALS, INCLUDING

54
00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:20,133
THEN TREASURY SECRETARY HAD TO

55
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:20,600
SAY ABOUT THIS.

56
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,135
>> IRAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE

57
00:01:22,135 --> 00:01:23,569
DENIED ACCESS TO THE WORLD'S

58
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:28,174
LARGEST MARKET, AND WILL

59
00:01:28,174 --> 00:01:28,875
MAINTAIN POWERFUL SANCTIONS.

60
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,743
>> IRAN WILL BE DENIED ACCESS TO

61
00:01:30,743 --> 00:01:31,577
THE WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT

62
00:01:31,577 --> 00:01:33,746
MARKET AND UNABLE TO DEAL IN THE

63
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:35,481
WORLD'S MOST IMPORTANT CURRENCY.

64
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:36,449
>> Shannon: THAT WAS BACK IN

65
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:36,983
2015.

66
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:38,217
SHORTLY AFTER THE DEAL HAD COME

67
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:38,785
TOGETHER.

68
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:41,387
WHAT YOU LATER FOUND, IN THE

69
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:43,423
SPRING OF 2016, THIS

70
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:44,590
ADMINISTRATION, THE PREVIOUS

71
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:45,358
ADMINISTRATION, ACTUALLY GRANTED

72
00:01:45,358 --> 00:01:46,025
A LICENSE WHICH WOULD HAVE

73
00:01:46,025 --> 00:01:47,193
ALLOWED THEM TO DO WHAT THEY

74
00:01:47,193 --> 00:01:49,295
NEEDED TO DO, WHICH WAS GET THE

75
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:49,929
CURRENCY TRANSLATED INTO

76
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:51,297
SOMETHING IF THEY COULD THEN

77
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:53,499
SEND, AND THEY WERE ANGRY WITH

78
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:54,467
THE ADMINISTRATION, FRUSTRATED

79
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:55,535
THAT THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE

80
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:56,836
GETTING WHAT THEY HAD AGREED TO

81
00:01:56,836 --> 00:01:57,870
UNDER THE DEAL.

82
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,672
>> $5.8 BILLION.

83
00:01:59,672 --> 00:02:03,376
IN A BANK IN OMAN, AND THEY

84
00:02:03,376 --> 00:02:05,344
WANTED TO CONVERT THAT INTO

85
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:07,146
EUROS ULTIMATELY, TRUE DOLLARS,

86
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:09,348
SINCE THEY HAD A

87
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:10,015
DOLLAR-DENOMINATED CURRENCY,

88
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:11,684
BETTER TO DO DOLLARS.

89
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:12,552
THEY ASKED THE TREASURY

90
00:02:12,552 --> 00:02:13,453
DEPARTMENT IF THEY COULD GET THE

91
00:02:13,453 --> 00:02:15,388
ABILITY TO DO THAT AND SURE

92
00:02:15,388 --> 00:02:16,556
ENOUGH, THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT

93
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:18,391
GRANTED THEM A LICENSE TO DO

94
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:18,691
THAT.

95
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:20,193
WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THEY WENT

96
00:02:20,193 --> 00:02:22,962
TO THE TWO BIG U.S. BANKS, THE

97
00:02:22,962 --> 00:02:24,597
APPROPRIATE BANKS TO DO THIS,

98
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,399
BOTH BANKS SAID, NO, WE WANTS

99
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:28,167
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

100
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:28,801
THIS IS WRONG.

101
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:31,204
IN OTHER WORDS, THE REPUTATIONAL

102
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:32,405
RISK OR LESS AND LEGAL RISKS

103
00:02:32,405 --> 00:02:34,173
WERE TOO HIGH.

104
00:02:34,173 --> 00:02:35,741
ULTIMATELY, THE DOLLARS WERE NOT

105
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:36,609
PROVIDED TO CONVERT THAT

106
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:37,376
CURRENCY.

107
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:38,945
OVER TIME, THEY CONVERTED TO

108
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:40,480
EUROS, AS WE UNDERSTAND IT,

109
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,081
SMALL AMOUNTS IN EUROPE, MUCH

110
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:42,615
LESS EFFICIENTLY.

111
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,817
THE POINT IS, AT THAT TIME, THE

112
00:02:44,817 --> 00:02:45,518
ADMINISTRATION WAS SAYING, WE

113
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:46,719
ARE NOT ALLOWING THE U.S.

114
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,987
FINANCIAL SYSTEM TO BE USED, WE

115
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:49,055
ARE NOT ALLOWING THE DOLLAR TO

116
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:51,390
BE USED, KEEPING THE SANCTIONS

117
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,458
IN PLACE, ONLY THE SECONDARY

118
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,026
SANCTIONS AND OTHERS ARE WE

119
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:54,994
ALLOWING THE ARRAY NEEDS TO HAVE

120
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:56,729
ACCESS TO, WHEN IN FACT, THEY

121
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:58,865
WERE GRANTING THIS LICENSE.

122
00:02:58,865 --> 00:02:59,899
IT'S JUST WRONG.

123
00:02:59,899 --> 00:03:02,168
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FLUSH

124
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,769
THAT OUT BECAUSE NOW WITH REGARD

125
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,771
TO THE NEXT IRAN AGREEMENT, OR

126
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:06,939
WITH REGARD TO THE AGREEMENT

127
00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:08,508
WITH NORTH KOREA, WILL REQUIRE

128
00:03:08,508 --> 00:03:10,309
MORE TRANSPARENCY AND IT IS PART

129
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,910
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS.

130
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,778
>> Shannon: SOME RESPONSE TO

131
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:14,747
THE REPORT, NET PRICE, PART OF

132
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:15,948
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SAYS,

133
00:03:15,948 --> 00:03:17,016
"THEY CONTINUE TO MALIGN THE

134
00:03:17,016 --> 00:03:20,753
DEAL IN AN EFFORT TO JUSTIFY

135
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:21,587
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S UNJUSTIFIABLE

136
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:22,188
DECISION."

137
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:24,056
REFERRING TO THE FACT THAT

138
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:24,757
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS WITHDRAWN

139
00:03:24,757 --> 00:03:25,591
FROM THE DEAL.

140
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:26,626
THEY SAY THIS IS ABOUT

141
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:27,593
BESMIRCHING THE DEAL AND NOTHING

142
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:28,161
MORE.

143
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:29,762
SPEAK OF THIS INVESTIGATION IS

144
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:30,997
TWO YEARS OLD.

145
00:03:30,997 --> 00:03:31,764
IT BEGAN LONG BEFORE

146
00:03:31,764 --> 00:03:32,565
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT,

147
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:34,333
MUCH MORE THAT HE WOULD PULL OUT

148
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:34,901
OF THE IRAN AGREEMENT.

149
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,670
BUT IT WAS DONE IN A TOTALLY

150
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,172
STRAIGHT UP, OBJECTIVE WAY.

151
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:40,973
WE FOUND THAT THIS HAD OCCURRED,

152
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,175
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME

153
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,177
AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT.

154
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:47,013
AND AGAIN, FOR THE FUTURE, THAT

155
00:03:47,013 --> 00:03:47,980
WE HAVE BETTER TRANSPARENCY.

156
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,582
ANYTIME THERE'S A SPECIAL

157
00:03:49,582 --> 00:03:50,349
LICENSE GRANTED, CONGRESS OUGHT

158
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:51,450
TO KNOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

159
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,618
OFTEN OPERATE IN THIS CASE, IT

160
00:03:52,618 --> 00:03:54,587
WAS KEPT FROM US.

161
00:03:54,587 --> 00:03:56,589
BECAUSE, AS HE SAID EARLIER,

162
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:58,191
IRAN WAS FRUSTRATED, ANGRY, WE

163
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:59,292
KNEW THIS FROM PUBLIC AND

164
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,726
PRIVATE DOCUMENTS, THEY WANTED

165
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,428
TO BE SURE IRAN WOULD STAY WITH

166
00:04:02,428 --> 00:04:05,331
THE AGREEMENT, AND SO THEY WERE

167
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:06,766
WILLING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS

168
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:07,433
COUNTERS ARE NOT JUST WITH A

169
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,401
WITH ED TO DO, BUT COUNTER TO

170
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:09,969
THE APPROACH HERE, WHICH WAS

171
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:10,903
THAT HE WAS SANCTIONS WOULD

172
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:11,504
STAY IN PLACE.

173
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:13,039
>> Shannon: IS THERE ANY LEGAL

174
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,941
LIABILITY HERE?

175
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:16,776
WHAT DOES IT SAY TO YOU MORE

176
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:17,610
BROADLY ABOUT THE PREVIOUS

177
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,778
ADMINISTRATION'S DESIRE TO GET

178
00:04:18,778 --> 00:04:20,745
THEN LOGIN AND KEEP THIS DEAL IN

179
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:21,047
PLACE?

180
00:04:21,047 --> 00:04:22,248
>> IT SAYS THAT THEY WERE

181
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:23,583
WILLING TO DO THINGS THAT THEY

182
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,851
SHOULD NOT DO IN ORDER TO BOTH

183
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:27,186
GET THE IRANIANS TO THE TABLE,

184
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:29,155
AND THEN KEEP IT AT THE TABLE,

185
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:30,790
AND HOLD THE AGREEMENT.

186
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,191
THERE WAS A VOTE IN THE

187
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:32,992
UNITED STATES SENATE, PEOPLE

188
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,627
FORGET ABOUT THE SOMETIMES.

189
00:04:34,627 --> 00:04:36,195
THE VOTE WAS A MAJORITY

190
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,397
REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT VOTE

191
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:39,799
AGAINST THE IRAN AGREEMENT.

192
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,601
IT WASN'T NECESSARY TWO-THIRDS,

193
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:42,802
WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE HAD UNDER

194
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:43,836
THE RULES.

195
00:04:43,836 --> 00:04:45,471
BUT IT WAS A VOTE AGAINST IT.

196
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:46,872
NORMALLY, IF YOU'VE A TREATY,

197
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:49,642
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TWO-THIRDS

198
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:50,876
VOTE TO APPROVE IT.

199
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:51,611
EVEN IF THEY KNEW THEY COULDN'T

200
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:52,411
GET THAT, THEY DO NOT SEEK THIS

201
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:53,980
TO BE A TREATY.

202
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,147
WHEN THERE WAS A VOTE ON THIS

203
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:57,183
ISSUE IN CONGRESS, SURE ENOUGH,

204
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:58,584
A MAJORITY OF THE CONGRESS SAID,

205
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:00,553
THIS IS NOT A GOOD AGREEMENT.

206
00:05:00,553 --> 00:05:01,821
AND I THINK THAT IS ONE REASON

207
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,289
THE PRESIDENT CHOSE, BECAUSE HE

208
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,390
WAS ABLE TO COME WITHOUT HAVING

209
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,359
A TREATY, TO PULL BACK AND TO

210
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:07,426
SAY, LET'S PUT TOGETHER

211
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:08,194
SOMETHING THAT MAKES MORE SENSE.

212
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:10,496
>> Shannon: I KNOW IT'S BEEN A

213
00:05:10,496 --> 00:05:11,797
LONG PROCESS, FLEW UNDER OUR

214
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:12,598
RADAR.

215
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:14,200
WE HAD NO IDEA.

216
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,568
DEMOCRATS ALSO WORKED WITH YOU

217
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:17,637
ON THIS, CHOSE NOT TO SIGN THE

00:05:17,637 --> 00:00:00,000
