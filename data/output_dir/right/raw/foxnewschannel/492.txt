1
00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:01,672
WATCHING THE WHEELS TURN.

2
00:00:01,672 --> 00:00:05,843
>> Trace: JOHN ROBERTS LIVE

3
00:00:05,843 --> 00:00:06,477
FOR US ON THE NORTH LAWN.

4
00:00:06,477 --> 00:00:06,944
JOHN, THANK YOU.

5
00:00:06,944 --> 00:00:07,578
LET'S BRING IN CHRIS WALL

6
00:00:07,578 --> 00:00:08,279
LALS THE ANCHOR OF "FOX NEWS

7
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:08,613
SUNDAY."

8
00:00:08,613 --> 00:00:09,313
CHRIS, YOU NAILED IT LITTLE

9
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:10,681
EARLIER WHEN YOU WERE SAYING

10
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:15,420
LOOK, ALL BETS ARE OFF.

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,020
CHRIS COONS CAME OUT AND

12
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,621
SAID HE THINKS THAT THE

13
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,255
EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE, THE

14
00:00:17,255 --> 00:00:17,822
ONE THAT'S BEFORE THE

15
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:18,489
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SHOULD

16
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:19,123
BE THE FOCUS OF THIS FBI

17
00:00:19,123 --> 00:00:19,557
INVESTIGATION.

18
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:20,858
BUT, WHO KNOWS IF ANOTHER

19
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:22,760
ALLEGATION COMES FORWARD

20
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,362
THEN ALL BETS ARE OFF.

21
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:26,297
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU

22
00:00:26,297 --> 00:00:28,866
KNOW, THERE IS ALL THIS TALK

23
00:00:28,866 --> 00:00:30,702
ABOUT IT ALL DEPENDS ON

24
00:00:30,702 --> 00:00:31,903
CHUCK GRASSLEY AND IT ALL

25
00:00:31,903 --> 00:00:32,804
DEPENDS ON PRESIDENT TRUMP.

26
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,005
IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T.

27
00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:37,675
IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE THREE

28
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,278
MODERATE APPARENTLY WAVERING

29
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:42,380
REPUBLICANS, JEFF FLAKE,

30
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,781
LISA MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN

31
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:44,115
COLLINS.

32
00:00:44,115 --> 00:00:45,917
IF TWO OF THE THREE ARE

33
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:47,752
DEMANDING A WEEK DELAY UNTIL

34
00:00:47,752 --> 00:00:49,287
THERE IS AT MOST UNTIL THERE

35
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:50,622
IS AN FBI INVESTIGATION OF

36
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:52,557
THE ALLEGATIONS, THEN THEY

37
00:00:52,557 --> 00:00:53,658
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO AGREE

38
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:55,126
TO THAT AND HAVE A WEEK

39
00:00:55,126 --> 00:00:55,493
DELAY.

40
00:00:55,493 --> 00:00:57,128
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE 50

41
00:00:57,128 --> 00:00:58,429
VOTES PLUS THE TIE BREAKING

42
00:00:58,429 --> 00:00:59,130
VOTE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT

43
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,131
TO PUT THE NOMINATION OVER

44
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:02,500
THE TOP.

45
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,601
AND, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

46
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:06,004
YOU KNOW, TIME IS AN ENEMY

47
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:06,871
OF THIS NOMINATION.

48
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,540
AND AS WE SAW OVER THE LAST

49
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:09,975
FEW DAYS, AND THEY SEEM TO

50
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:11,710
HAVE BEEN PRETTY THIN, ALL

51
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:14,846
OF A SUDDEN OR COMPLETELY

52
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:16,648
FALSE THESE ALLEGATIONS KEPT

53
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:18,216
COMING IN ABOUT BRETT

54
00:01:18,216 --> 00:01:19,484
KAVANAUGH AND IF THERE IS A

55
00:01:19,484 --> 00:01:21,219
WEEK DELAY, I DON'T WANT TO

56
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,088
BE CYNICAL ABOUT THIS, BUT I

57
00:01:23,088 --> 00:01:24,322
BET THERE WILL BE MORE

58
00:01:24,322 --> 00:01:25,490
ALLEGATIONS AND I BET AND I

59
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,391
DON'T WANT TO BE CYNICAL

60
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:27,959
ABOUT THIS EITHER THAT MAYBE

61
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,094
NOT CHRIS COONS BUT SOME OF

62
00:01:29,094 --> 00:01:30,195
THE OTHER DEMOCRATS WILL SAY

63
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:31,396
WELL, A WEEK IS NOT ENOUGH

64
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:32,330
TO CONSIDER THOSE AND WE

65
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,765
HAVE GOT TO TAKE MORE TIME.

66
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:37,369
THIS REALLY DOES PUT THE

67
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:38,270
NOMINATION OF BRETT

68
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,705
KAVANAUGH IN SOME JEOPARDY

69
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:41,940
WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF THESE

70
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,974
ALLEGATIONS PROVE OUT TO BE

71
00:01:42,974 --> 00:01:47,345
TRUE OR NOT.

72
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:48,947
>> Trace: A.P. JUST ALERTED,

73
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:49,848
CHRIS AND I WATCHED YOUR

74
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:50,916
COVERAGE ALL DAY YESTERDAY

75
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,485
YOU ALLUDED TO THIS MARK

76
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:55,520
JUDGE HAS NOW SAID HE WILL

77
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,922
COOPERATE IN THIS.

78
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:58,590
THAT IS HUGE AS WE GO

79
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,291
FORWARD.

80
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,159
>> YES, IT IS.

81
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,561
BECAUSE, LOOK, I DON'T THINK

82
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:04,196
THAT THE FBI INVESTIGATION

83
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:06,965
OF THE CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD

84
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:07,833
ALLEGATION SHOULD TAKE THAT

85
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:08,133
LONG.

86
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,701
I MEAN, THERE ARE ONLY,

87
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,136
WHAT, THREE OTHER PEOPLE

88
00:02:11,136 --> 00:02:13,639
THAT SHE NAMES, MARK JUDGE,

89
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,410
SOME FRIEND OF KAVANAUGH,

90
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,446
AND JUDGE FRIEND PJ AND

91
00:02:21,446 --> 00:02:24,549
FRIEND LEE LAND KAISER.

92
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,151
NOT LIKE INVESTIGATION GOT

93
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:27,552
ALL TENTACLES GOING OUT.

94
00:02:27,552 --> 00:02:28,854
THEY COULD TALK TO THEM

95
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:29,388
PRETTY QUICKLY.

96
00:02:29,388 --> 00:02:31,156
THEY ALL DENIED ANYTHING HAD

97
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:31,590
HAPPENED.

98
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,391
OBVIOUSLY A STATEMENT

99
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:34,259
WRITTEN THROUGH A LAWYER, A

100
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:35,827
WRITTEN STATEMENT IS

101
00:02:35,827 --> 00:02:38,697
DIFFERENT THAN SUBMITTING TO

102
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:39,598
AN FBI QUESTIONING.

103
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:40,432
I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CALL

104
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:41,867
IT INTERROGATION OR NOT.

105
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:45,103
AND OBVIOUSLY, DEMOCRATS ARE

106
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:46,171
COUNTING ON THE IDEA THAT

107
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,005
SUDDENLY ONE OF THEM IS

108
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:48,907
GOING TO CRACK AND SAY OH,

109
00:02:48,907 --> 00:02:50,008
YEAH, DO I REMEMBER IT AND

110
00:02:50,008 --> 00:00:00,000
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED
