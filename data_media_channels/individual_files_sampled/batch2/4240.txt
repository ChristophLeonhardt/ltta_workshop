guy president Trump also launched an attack at senator Elizabeth Warren a potential 2020 rival and appeared to mock the me to movement while doing so let's say I'm debating Pocahontas right I promise you I'll do this I will take you know those little kits they sell on television for two dollars learn your heritage and in the middle of the debate when she proclaims a tease of Indian heritage because her mother said she has high cheekbones we will take that little tit and say but we have to do it gently because we're in the me two generations who have to be very gentle and we will very gently take that kid and we will slowly toss it hoping it doesn't hit her and injure her arm even though it only weighs probably two ounces and we will say I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity paid for by Trump if you take the test that it shows you're an idiot you know and let's see what she does so senator Warren responded last night on Twitter writing hey Donald Trump while you obsess over my jeans your administration is conducting DNA tests and little kids because you ripped them from their mamas and you were too incompetent to reunite them in time to meet a court order maybe you should focus on fixing the lives you're destroying so obviously Jonathan the Pocahontas line is one of the greatest hits if we call a rock concert that people are going to see but the way he talked about the me2 movement which is over the last year or so as a collection of women who've gone through horrific things in their lives her truly horrific things and had the courage to step forward I know nothing matters to him I know words don't matter and everything is sort of like skywriting and evaporates after he says that he doesn't worry about the consequences but we saw in the background some eyes rolling if you look at that clip did is there anything in here where you could say that bridge too far does he care between the campaign and then the rally she's he's held since taking office I've been 200 more of these and they're still see it almost surprises me that I can still be surprised and this was one of those moments I mean yes the the attack Elizabeth Warren for the Pocahontas thing that is as you said that's in that's in the repertoire he breaks that out most nights but to go to the me to movement which of course as you just said has meant so much to so many people but this is also his back that's right and Donald Trump is someone who has been accused of sexual assault we have heard you know on the access hollywood tape brag about grabbing women without their consent but also helps he is bragged let's make no mistake about it he's bragged it is on tape about sexually assaulting women this also comes on the same day that the higher of bill shine becomes official bill shine who was ousted from Fox News for helping cover up these allegations of harassment and so on and but this is someone this is he viewed it as a punch line he made a joke of it and as Senator Warren pointed out to have it when DNA testing is so you know in the news right now because his administration has a bought this botched this scenario at the border separating children from their families and now having to use DNA to try to reunite them you know I wonder where wonder why I'm not that in the next block I do wonder why people that used to call themselves conservatives Laura Ingraham Sean Hannity people who used to claim to be Republicans but aren't are not even close I guess they never were I guess it's about being an anti liberal instead of being a conservative wonder what people like that just sit back and while Donald Trump is mocking John McCain that well Donald Trump is mocking George HW Bush after all they've given to this country and after all those people and other Republicans just sit back and say nothing it's so funny some of these same people would attack me in real time after I said like George W Bush lost the first presidential debate Laura Ingraham up the next day slamming me how dare you say that about George Tucker and then Sean Hannity attacking me for going after george w bush how dare you attack the President of the United States you left winger yeah when did you become a liberal no no no I'm not see it doesn't matter who's in power with them they're like Alan Dershowitz they just they're like moths that go to the flame so if George W Bush is president the United States they attack anybody like me he was attacking george w bush for spending too much money for running a deep debt i mitt romney i said blake around Labor Day in 2012 Mitt Romney was gonna lose the election eight a horrible campaign get absolutely castigated mica can tell you my Twitter feed just ran non-stop it was a lot of these same Stooges that would just sit there to help dare you attack Mitt Romney and then boy do they turn on it so they're not conservatives they're all about power all you have to do is just look and see the the people that they bowed and scrape to before george w bush george HW bush john mckay it's all on tapes by the way I don't want you now it's all on tapes it's all in the transcripts just like with me everything I've ever said all on tape all in the transcripts so the very people that were there alan dershowitz is on talk radio protecting the powerful even when it was indefensible now they're sitting there reveling that these two men as they lay dying what does that say what are they I don't D call them they're not gonna we know they're not conservatives there's nothing conservative about the Republic they're just anti-liberal is it just about trolling liberals and not having an agenda of your own or is it just about power it's definitely a man power they also have something that they've never had before a pliable president he just gets molded around into whatever they're looking for and they love that they love that they could just have another kind of TV star pliable issue they just go and speak to him and he kind of changes his position is the cost of that cheering on the mocking of an American hero who gave his all in Vietnam while Donald Trump had five deferments and on the day he graduated from Penn I think 40 Americans died in Vietnam is that the cost of that I don't think the cost is that I I don't think you have to call to mock a man who was dying of brain cancer I don't think you have to mock George HW Bush a man who gave us everything he had from being shot down in World War two to being there when the Berlin wall collapsed they take their cues from the president this is team red versus team blue red not necessarily as Republican don't they just as Rommel as just Trump and that if Donald Trump John McCain George HW Bush in that case George Bush and Jeb Bush and that's why this is all linked because they there's like they never supported him he fused them as the enemy and therefore no matter what physical state they may be in no matter how decorated their resume may be Rene opposed him he will take their shots and then others in the media will follow his lead you know what's interesting is that you say team red versus team blue I'd give friends say on Twitter other day you know Joe Joe and I are good friends and he's always been a good friend of mine we're just on opposite ends of the political spectrum and because I'm a good friend I didn't write back and say oh because when people come up to me and say oh I don't like your pies at all I'm sorry when did you become a liberal because again transcripts are forever I went back just to make sure cleaning up my house boxing things up making a move and I found some 1994 literature it's very shocking how much I've changed since 1994 fight to balance the budget fight to reform entitlements fight for a stronger military fight to cut you know yeah of course abolish Department agencies excessive Department agencies it's the same thing an obsession on small government an obsession on devolve empower from Washington to the state's an obsession on all the things that Donald Trump's not obsessed on biggest spending bill in the history of the planet and they sit there and they scrape and bow to it you got a guy who's trying to expand the powers of the presidency an unprecedented way something that does violence to Madison's view of checks and balances something that we as conservatives always talked about on the campaign trail but they just sit back and they bow and scrape they have no agenda but bowing to Donald I look I'd love to hear it I'd love to hear them tell us what is their consistent conservative agenda other than not liking Nancy Pelosi because that's not an agenda that's not what takes us forward into the 21st century and they're attacking NATO he's attacking Germany he's attacking England he's attacking print he's attacking all of our friends and he's embracing Vladimir Putin a Russian who has tried according to Donald Trump's for Intel Chiefs to undermine American democracy and it has been an ongoing project by his government since 2014 you don't believe me fellas ask Sean Sean Hannity why don't you see what Dan Coates said about it Laura Ingraham why don't you see what Mike Pompeo said about it why don't you ask what the FBI director said about it why don't you ask what all of Donald Trump's appointed Intel Chiefs said about it Vladimir Putin is trying to subvert American democracy their words to the Senate and yet Donald Trump said what do you say last night there's nothing wrong with that says Putin was fine we're fine Newton is fine I don't know I'm still a conservative that kind of takes it personally when Russia tries to subvert our democracy but I guess you know I guess I think that makes me on the other team oh by the way I support free trade too so we showed you Elizabeth Warren's response to Trump's attack against her bringing up what his policy of separating families has done to people's lives still ahead we're gonna get to the latest on the effects of this policy but let you see it some families finally reunited after days weeks months apart this little girl she's eight she hadn't seen her mom in 55 days boy this is heartbreaking and there are new numbers of just how many children were separated from their parents at the US border there are children waiting to see their mother's or Father's there are mothers waiting to see their babies and no word yet on exactly how that's going to happen plus Michael Cohen has a new attorney B former special counsel to President Bill Clinton didn't see that
