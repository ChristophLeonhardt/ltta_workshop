if you take a DNA test that proves that you're a Native American so she took the DNA test and it didn't go the way that she wanted I think it proves that she's almost entirely white the Ted that so 99.9% chance she's white the test did show the possibility that she has a smidgen of Native American ancestry at the very most 1/32 Native American and perhaps more likely closer to 1,000 24th Native American well she is less than 1/1000 Native American possibly according to this test and the DNC and the Liz Warren campaign and the left is releasing this as though it is a victory and I we actually have exclusive footage from inside the Liz Warren campaign headquarters inside the Democratic National Committee headquarters to see why they're releasing this as a victory people made fun of me for being French DNA and me showed I was 8 percent Navajo nobody's making fun of me now or my people who are victims I'm thirteen percent victim 21 victim order now and find out if your friend should be more sympathetic order now is that a new sponsor a ridiculous that find out of you are a victim the victim identifier that is what Liz Warren is so happy about so you know I thought that I was just a coddled a white woman white as can be her Harvard employee you know traded on my fake ancestry to gain a professional advantage you know now a member of the United States Senate but really I'm a victim really Liz Warren is a victim that is the this is the Boston Globe story we've got to get into this because the the way that the left is reacting is lunacy Boston Globe comes out they say quote senator Elizabeth Warren has released a DNA test that provides strong evidence she had a Native American in her family tree dating back to ten generations an unprecedented move by one of the top possible contenders for the 2020 Democratic nomination for president and this is very important this is unprecedented because it shows how insane the left has gotten about their racism about their race obsession they are now releasing tests that show that they have one one thousandth Native American blood they see I'm to see I'm on that race I'm that race that race matters that's what I'm gonna win that is unprecedented that is bizarre that we're now releasing our racial pedigrees when we're running for public office that not not in 70 years or so have we seen that in a developed country that is pretty crazy and it's the Democrats doing it all in the name of progressivism the piece goes on Warren whose claims to Native American blood have been mocked by President Trump and other Republicans provided the test results to the globe on Sunday in an effort to defuse questions about her ancestry that have persisted for years she planned an elaborate rollout Monday of the results as she aimed for widespread attention this is like that scene you know that Jim Carrey clip where I think it was him Dumb and Dumber where the girl is like I will never date you you're awful I hate you no no no and he just look so he goes so you're saying there's a chance that that is Liz Warren opening these test results all right give it to me straight doctor well Liz you're between ninety six point nine and ninety-nine point nine percent white so you're saying there's a chance you're saying there's a chance I'm Cherokee that is absurd this was done by Carlos Bustamante Stanford University geneticist I am trying to analyze just for you how the left possibly thinks that this is a win because it's even it see the news news reporters got the number wrong they initially thought it was between 1/32 and one 500th I think Indian now if they've revised that to one thirty second to one one thousandth Indian also Native American DNA is notoriously unreliable in these tests the reason for that is that Native Americans don't take these tests one because they don't care they know that they're Native American and too because you know Native Americans have been treated a little rough in this country from time to time so they don't they don't want to give over their their DNA to these guys the the important statistic here is not 1/32 it's not one 1,024 it's not whatever the average European American is 1.8% Indian Native American American indigenous whatever euphemism you want to use that's the average white American has 1.8% Indian in them Liz Warren has almost that exact same amount possibly significantly less it would be it would mean that virtually every white member of the United States Senate Congress running for president could say I'm an Indian I'm Cherokee prove that I'm not because don't forget Liz Warren used this for professional benefit she says that she didn't fact check her left-wing commentary websites say that she didn't she did she certainly did we'll get into that in a second I my first thought on this was what was she thinking and I'm not the only one and this is not just a partisan reaction Jim Messina who was Barack Obama's campaign chairman he also was furious he's tweeting and who's saying what are you thinking 22 days before an important election the midterm elections Liz Warren is doubling down on this absurd claim that she's an Indian telling you not to believe your lying eyes because she's one one-thousandth Native American what are you thinking Liz word after the Cavanaugh effect that's already killing Democrats and swing races Liz Warren comes down and says yeah but really I'm chief Lyle Wafaa give me a break so so Jim Jim Messina and I agree on this we don't agree on much but we agree on that Liz Warren needs less attention on her ancestry I know you know what it is it's that President Trump gets in the heads of his opponents because he's so brash and infuriating cuz he's like a little schoolyard bully who's holding Liz Warren's like stalks of corn and wampum I don't know I'm trying to make an analogy here she's holding it he's holding it above her head and she's saying I'm real I am Native American you're not you're Pocahontas I am Native America and he's he's driving them if she were thinking clearly here if she were thinking rationally she would not take a test she would not make a big news story about it she would not do any of that what she is thinking is that this issue is dogged her in her career it might prevent her from being successful in 2020 president Trump has forever branded her Pocahontas so she what she is thinking is right now even before the midterms I'm gonna get this story out there my personal Pravda the Boston Globe is gonna run with it and they're going to cover for me in all of the media are gonna cover for me and then when it comes up again the next time President Trump calls me Pocahontas in six months I can say I took a test and it proves I'm Native American that's not how this is gonna play out that is not how this is going to play out President Trump is gonna have a field day with this I hope he has a field day with this he hasn't really gotten too into it yet I hope he's just he's just you know testing out the tweets he's trying he's massaging it like a poet with the you know with his meter and his rhyme scheme trying to get the tweets right this has no upside for Liz Warren how are you gonna react to this so Liz Warren claims for her professional career that she's Native American not even just like part Native American she's listed in the Harvard directory is Native American she contributes a recipe to a Native American cookbook called powwow Chow as Elizabeth Warren Cherokee not Elizabeth Warren 99.9% generic white possibly point 1% Cherokee been probably not even that just Elizabeth Warren Cherokee so she's been Duke using this for her entire academic career and then she says no no I wasn't lying see I'm 1/1000 that Native American who is that gonna convince conservatives obviously you're gonna have to laugh at that as we've been doing all day but or is that going to convince moderates is that gonna convince independence you say oh well you know I thought she was lying about being Native American but she's one one-thousandth so I don't know I'm I must be like one one-thousandth sub-saharan African right somewhere especially Italy and a lot of people are moving around and Sicily in the in the good old days does that doesn't make me a black guy doesn't I don't I don't get to say certain words I don't get to sing certain songs that are politically incorrect and offensive absolutely not of course not and this doesn't make her in Indian but even among the left because I think what she's thinking right now is okay I'm going to at least give myself this data point that I can always point back to before the 2020 primaries heat up and I'm going to give leftist progressives an excuse not to hate me I'm gonna give the race obsessed laughs an excuse not to hate me is that really gonna work because now they know now they know that she's 99.9% white before we all everybody knew it but there was this kind of you could just pretend say well we don't know she never took a test she could be Indian we just don't know and she doesn't look Indian but we don't know now we know it's like the monster in a horror movie you know when you when you're watching a horror movie and the monster the killer is off screen you fill it with whatever you want to see you fill it with your imagination and it really works when you see the monster it's always a letdown because it can't live up to your expectations that is how the race obsessed left the activists that Liz Warren is trying to appeal to here that's what they're gonna see because the reality is going to disappoint them it already has before we get any further with this let me tell you about something that doesn't disappoint me black rifle coffee make a little money honey if you have ever found yourself wincing at the weak taste of coffee from those left-leaning soy corporate brands you know the ones that have become homeless shelters in recent days because of ridiculous PR stones I don't know I'm just the ones that maybe come from the city of Seattle I don't know I'm just I don't want to name any other brand you've probably thought I wish they spent less time on meaningless bias training bathroom policy reform donating to Planned Parenthood all that other stuff that defies common sense a more time on their coffee that's why you need black rifle coffee founded by former Special Operations veterans black rifle delivers the best roasts to order coffee right to your door I gotta tell you I would probably buy it just to support veterans first responder causes because they're not politically correct wackos yeah but what actually matters to me is just how good the coffee is the coffee is excellent you cannot beat the coffee it is superb I drink it all time mmm I'm sorry that was left us tears yeah I also have coffee out of that too though this guarantees you're getting fresh premium coffee with every order in addition to great coffee and gear black rifle as a coffee club that makes things easy they also give a portion of their sales to veteran and first responder causes so that's a wonderful thing to visit black rifle coffee I'm slash cough fa c OV e fe fe you're gonna want a little bit of both in your day little coffee a little cough fa you can have one without the other receive 15% off your order black rifle coffee calm slash cough fa co v fe fe for 15% off black rifle coffee calm / co FFA go get it it's very very delicious so i think this is gonna backfire because in the intersectional left just like in that commercial you know I'm a victim I'm one thirty-second victim I'm one 1000th victim you're if you're a white lady from Harvard you're gonna lose that battle eventually and now we have the data point now when she says we don't know I might be Native American you say you're not you're one one-thousandth Native American maybe maybe not even that I think that's gonna really hurt her also I would like to point out identity politics doesn't work for Native Americans because there aren't enough of them so I think I think they're kind of believing their own press releases they're believing some of the stuff that they're putting out there in their advertisements and this is an important lesson one of the best pieces of advice I ever got from my mother is don't believe your own press releases don't believe the stuff that you were saying just to kind of puff up your activities or puff up your campaign or but don't don't fall into the trap of believing that yourself I think she's believing that she thinks if I can claim even one one-millionth Native American ancestry I'll get that victim point you won't the the appeal of racial identity politics which the left has totally embraced for decades now the appeal is a brutal appeal it's not an ideological appeal it's not a philosophical appeal it is brutal it gets to our very basic animal instincts which is you look like me uh you look like you I'll vote for you that's the appeal that they're making and it's it's pretty cheap and it's pretty tawdry and it's not a human or humanistic or elevated appeal but it only works if you look like the person it only the identity appeal only works if you can say yeah I'm gonna help out black people specifically and that other guy hates black people and I'm gonna help out Hispanics specifically and the other guys hate Hispanics and only if you're appealing directly that group what's the appeal for Native Americans what what argument is she making on behalf of Native Americans how many are going to swing the vote at least in certain municipalities if you can actually appeal to race and you can get racial groups to vote as a bloc then you can then it works it at least pays off at the ballot box that doesn't work for Native Americans its shoes must be kicking herself that she doesn't have some you know more more populist racial minority group that she could cynically try to play on the other the other reason this doesn't work for Democrats is it reminds American voters of the Democrats terrible history so this is not going to be as bad in effect as the rest of them but it reminds voters of the one-drop rule which is this racist Democrat policy from the 19th and 20th centuries that if you had even one little teensy drop of black heritage in you then you were black for purposes of the law and therefore you were a second-class citizen that that's obviously a racist idea it's a creates racial hierarchies that do not and should not exist and she's buying into that a century later for her Native American lies because what a tangled web we leave when we when we practice to conceive when we practiced oh that's know that that was a Freudian slip a Freudian slip is where you say one thing I mean your mother what a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive and that's what Liz Warren has done she told this lie in the 1980s she was becoming a professor she switched from white ethnicity to Indian Native American ethnicity this as she contributed you know recipes to that cookbook and Harvard touted this for her they said we have a Native American on staff she's been covering up for that lie ever since and this evidence today exposes that lie even more just putting aside all of that ugliness does she really think this quells the issue that people gonna say okay well okay one one-thousandth of course not this is more fodder and she's using this to galvanize the left does she not think her primary opponents in 2020 on the left are gonna use this does she not realize that Kamala Harris Cory Booker Joe Biden all of these guys are gonna clobber her with this it's not she is not the leader in this presidential race right now if anybody is probably Joe Biden is because Barack Obama might support him if there's a breakout star right now she is not the leader she cannot play it as though she's the the nominee she's got to play really hard punch really hard and she's not doing it why did she do it I think she did it because Trump makes people expose who they are he makes people exposed to they really are you know I I remember this vividly in the 2016 primaries there was that moment on stage where President Trump he's talking to Jeb Bush he's prodding Jeb Bush and Jeb Bush says something that you know he thought Donald would approve of and Donald puts his hand out there and Bush smacks it gives him a weird like awkward high-five and this killed Jeb Bush because Jeb Bush had been running on I am this serious mature confident person in the room very sober but now he was a case politician like everybody else and president Trump exposed that when he when he did is like yeehaw you know jump up in smack Trump's hand it exposed him is not really being more stable not really being more mature than anybody else he might have held a Shepley glass the right way but it exposed that lie he does it everybody did it to Hillary when he'll when he had a prodded Hillary Clinton into calling half the country deplorable and irredeemable she exposed who she was the Democrats now we're admitting to being a mob because they hate Trump so much they say yeah you bet we want to go clobber them at their house were their children sleep in restaurants you bet we're gonna go out there and get them so he's forcing them to admit who they are and Liz Warren is doing that too and unfortunately for Liz Walker and she's an old white lady this is the difference between Democrats and Republicans here because what are the Republicans talking about in their strategy sessions they say we're gonna go hard on political correctness we'll get to that in a second later we're gonna go hard on immigration we're gonna go hard on the economic prosperity the virtual extinction of unemployment the relative peace around the world that's we're gonna campaign on in this election what are the Democrats thinking thinking hmm is 132nd enough is that is one one-thousandth enough by the way it's not for membership in these Indian tribes usually you need one quarter Indian heritage that's for most tribes some you can go down to 1/16 I think the eastern Cherokees allow you to go down to 1/16 and the Cherokee Nation says there's no limit there's no minimum but you do have to be able to document it she doesn't have any of that Liz Warren doesn't have doesn't meet any of those requirements she would be rejected for membership even though she contributed powwow chow to that to that cookbook that is the reality of this and I'm one unless than 1/1000 the Native American is not an answer the other political error that she's making here is she doesn't realize that when you're explaining you're losing so Ronald Reagan articulated this very well when you are explaining in politics you are losing what do you mean by that well in politics sometimes the best defense is a good offense Trump is a good example Brett Kavanaugh is a good example when you punch back really hard it disorients your opponent but when you're explaining you've already given up the argument if somebody says to you when did you stop beating your wife you say well what well what did you did you talk to my wife my wife will tell you that that I didn't beat her and I Bubba and you've already lost because you've accepted the premise that they're giving you when you're explaining you're losing sometimes it's true the premise that Liz Warren is fighting against here is that she's a liar and a fraud and inauthentic that's true she's not gonna win by fighting that that's true she's a fraud she's not gonna win by explaining why she's not affront she's got to hit something else she's got to talk about I don't know healthcare or whatever other or you know soaking the rich I think his faith medicare-for-all I don't know is she's got to run on her socialist program that's the only way she has a chance if she's fighting on the terms of this premise that she's a she's not really inauthentic she's not really a fraud she's going to lose president Trump uses this to great effect when you're explaining you're losing so you always punch back if you saw this sixty minutes interview it was superb don't take my word for it cuz obviously I'm a little biased I like the president variety admitted this a left-wing Hollywood publication variety said quote sixty minutes outmatched by Donald Trump here's a clip of him talking to Lesley Stahl you go out and you go to Mississippi the famous Mississippi speech I had one beer well you think was shooting up that was one beer oh good how did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was it I don't know and you mimicked professor blase Ford you mimicked her had I not made that speech we would not have won I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything and you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary why did you have to make fun of her I didn't really make fun well they were what I said is the person that we're talking about didn't know the year the time the place professor Blasi Ford got before the Senate and and was asked what's the worst moment she said when the two boys laughed at me at my expense and then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her they can do what they tell you the way now justice Kavanagh was traded has become a big factor in the midterms have you seen what's gone on with the polls but did you have to well I think she was treated with great respect I'll be honest what do you think there were those things you shouldn't do you think you treated her with great I think so yeah I did but you seem to be saying that she lied what you know what I'm not gonna get into it because we won it doesn't matter we won did you see there is so much in that clip there actually it's an I mean it's typical you know Trump bluster but there is a lot of rhetoric to realize there and it's all on this when you're explaining you're losing so she brings it up she says you mocked you made fun of Christine Ford you that lady who could changed her story a thousand times and discovered these 30 year old memories after the fact at the 11th hour that you know that lady you made fun of of Christine Ford and so his first reaction is now I didn't really make fun of her so his first reaction is denial it's a very New York thing deny till you die so his first reaction is denial and then she shows the clip and she goes on and but you you you made fun of her why did you make fun of her now what a less skilled media operative or a less skilled politician would have done there is it I didn't I didn't really make fun of her I said hypothetically I just pointed out you know that testimony and but I wasn't making fun of her I was violence define the word fun and define making and well it depends on what the definition you know know what he does is he realizes where this is going if it were just one question they could move on but he realizes that Lesley Stahl of 60 minutes is gonna try to nail him on this point and just drill it until he says something stupid and they're gonna run with that so what does he do he immediately turns it to Cavanaugh he says look the way Kavanaugh was treated of very he even takes that little beat you can see it turn Cavanaugh was treated very unfairly what they did to Cavanaugh was so awful so he changes it he moves the topic into a new direction and then she says but I want to get back to talking about how you made fun of her didn't you didn't you make fun of her and he says absolutely not no I didn't do you notice the difference there at first he said I didn't really make fun of her - I did not make fun of her - then she says no didn't show though and he says I treated her with great respect I think I treated her with great respect with just within that answer now you might say he is sort of contradict one another they don't quite contradict one another but you are seeing rhetorical strategies change as he's getting where this is going and he is fighting he is punching right back because I think I treated her respectfully yeah I think I treated her respectfully and Lesley Stahl still pushes it so she's just there hectoring I'm just badgering him and so finally he says well we won doesn't really matter now does it because we got him on the court so yeah keep trying because we still on the court and that that were I think that really shows you a lot about how we should handle politics through the midterms and afterward they are not that's not an honest question were you making fun of her you were making fun of her were you making fun of her that's not an honest question that is a line of attack so you've got you can't counter that line of attack by trying to explain why you weren't really making fun of her he denied it he hit hard and then he changed the topic he moved on he blew right past it you know Antonin Scalia in an interview with Lesley Stahl and was the exact same setup he had a similar interaction with her where she said you say Justice Scalia the torture isn't cruel and unusual punishment and he says yeah that's right she goes well if you're trying to get information out of a terrorist is that yeah right if you're trying to get information that's not punishment then you're trying to get information how is that punishment because well you know because you're a terrorist and and she just keeps pushing just keep saying it's cruel and unusual it's cruel and unusual it's cruel and unusual punishment and finally he just cuts her off and he says well that's my view and it happens to be correct which is a line that I now use constantly you know whenever you really ever you get to the end of an argument said well that's my view and it happens to be correct and president Trump realizes this too I think Republicans should get it you know I saw Jeff Flake today was getting squishy again I know shock also water is wet in the sky is blue in the Sun shines and Jeff Flake said well we shouldn't have spiked the football over Cavanagh spike that football I want I want parrot jumpers you know out of helicopters and out of airplanes to grab a football not deploy their parachute and just dive it right into the dirt I want it to go halfway through the core of the earth spike that football it teaches them a lesson this is a bare knuckle moment and we can't have people who don't understand them so then there's more fake news I know you'll be shocked to find that out the fake news this weekend was particularly egregious NBC tweeted this out they said quote watch president Trump says that Robert Ely was a great general during ohio rally calling the Confederate leader incredible incredible not just great general you incredible now here's the clip that they posted with President Trump it also gave you a general who was incredible he drank a little bit too much you know who I'm talking about right so robert e lee was a great general and abraham lincoln developed a phobia he couldn't beat robert e lee he was going crazy couldn't be robert e lee okay ultra so you heard that you heard that begin that was the whole clip that they posted the trouble with their tweet is it that it was completely incorrect they tweeted out feel like a Herman Cain Herman Cain during one of the debates in 2012 some Bloomberg reporter said mister Cain we've analyzed your tax plan and it'll cost the government way too much money and he said well the problem with your analysis is that it is incorrect that's the the problem with your tweet NBC is that it is incorrect so it week correction an earlier tweet misidentified the general president Trump described as incredible at a rally in Ohio it was general ulysses s grant not general robert e lee it was the opposite general it was the good guy not the bad guy they go on an attached video clip lacked the full context for trump's remark here is the Folklife here's the full clip they didn't know how and one day it was looking really bad and lincoln just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem and lincoln said I don't care what problem he has you guys aren't winning and his name was Grant General Grant and his name was grant general grant you heard that the set up on the incredible general in that first clip was he had a drinking problem the payoff in this clip is he had a drinking problem but he was an incredible general ulysses s grant so they finally released that how long do you think it took NB c news to correct that story and and by correct i mean completely reverse it completely reverse it that you remember there was a study a few years ago that came out some psychology study that said that conservatives are much more likely to be authoritarian than leftists and then years later they corrected that and they said Oh actually it's the opposite Oh actually the leftists or authoritarian sorry we forgot it was opposite day when we released the video so I guess it was opposite day when NBC News released that clip how long do you think it took them to to correct that 5 minutes 10 minutes 10 minutes on Twitter's a long time two hours two days two days it took them are we to suspect that they didn't watch the clip I don't know maybe they watched the clip that they don't understand how language works that's perfectly plausible it took them two days that why because they're dishonest they always run the the fake story on page one and then the the correction on page 377 in this clip by the way tells us a lot about Donald Trump I'll tell you what it tells us in a second plus we've got to get on to how MIT Romney never learns anything some important polls for the midterm elections and then I think I've discovered the straw that broke the camel's back of political correctness I think I've discovered the end of political correctness but first we've got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube you go to daily wire calm and by the way if you join daily wire right now you will get early access to another Kingdom that's the podcast that I'm doing with Andrew Clavin he wrote the whole thing I read it it's been Illustrated it's got this incredible artwork now cool sets and it's drew story its second season first season was very popular this one is even cooler you will get that on Mondays and you'll get to watch the whole thing if you are a subscriber if you're not a subscriber you got to wait until Friday and then you just get to listen to it that's terrible don't do that go do it go to daily wire calm it's ten bucks a month $100 for an annual membership you get me you get the under Clavin sure you get the bench piercer you have questions the mailbag you test questions in the conversation but then you get this you get the leftist here's tumblr which contains heap big leftist tears these days heap big leftist tears this is this has sustained my ancestors for generations and generations the great spirit of the leftist tears has moved from plane to plane as the Knowles family has moved across this great country and it can sustain you too this is at look you know I'm a Native American I was born in America this is a little native secret that I've uncovered is the leftist years it will sustain you will bring you joy all the days of your life go to daily wire calm we'll be right back with a lot more this clip tells us a lot about Donald Trump because he's talking about Ulysses s screen he says look there was this incredible guy but he had a drinking problem and so they didn't they didn't pick him then the Lincoln had this trouble because the Confederate General Robert E Lee was a great general and he kept winning with victory after victory and Lincoln picked all the guys who looked like the good generals all the guys who should have been the good generals you know they they had the right cut of their jib and they talked good and they went to West Point and they they all should have been great generals but they kept losing to robert e lee and so lincoln took a little look over at that alcoholic that guy or the drinking problem ulysses s grant and he picked him and he said i don't care if he's got a drinking problem he can win he can fight and he can win I'll put the historical seriousness of that story aside and just listen to Trump telling that story he's talking about himself and this is actually pretty self effacing one of the things about Trump is he's this big ego right he's always talking Trump is on every building that he's ever walked by he's plastered his name on it this is pretty self effacing because he's comparing himself to an alcoholic he's saying look I know I don't look like the tough conservative president I know I don't sound like him I don't talk like the president I don't talk like the guy who can fix the economy bring peace around the world you know fix some wars here and there we renegotiate a tree I know I don't talk like that guy and I don't look like that guy and I've got my own flaws but sometimes that's just the guy who can get it done and I think he's absolutely right and and some more evidence for this is that he said this before they were talking about Brett Cavanaugh's beer-drinking you know I like beer I still like beer I drink beer I like beer and Trump said you know I'm basically the only politician in the world who can say I've never had a beer I've just never I've never had a beer and imagine if I did I would be the worst the only good thing about me is that I don't drink now this is quote was almost almost word-for-word his quote and that was self effacing means he's got a sense of his own flaws and he's a very flawed guy no question about it but for him to talk like this at a rally is pretty impressive to me it actually shows me that he understands his place not just in the Republican Party not just in the American government but also in history that he's the guy who goes in and just the unlikely fixer he's the unlikely guy that you'd never pick in ideal circumstances you'd always pick the guys who look like they should win except they can't win so you picked that guy and maybe he can pull you pull you out of victory I'm really impressed when I see these things sometimes I worry you know that he really is the caricature that the left makes him out to be but then he keeps getting stuff right so I don't believe that and I really you know I trust my lyin eyes before I trust the lying New York Times compare him compare that line to Mitt Romney who we've talked about I think months ago on the show we talked about him Mitt Romney can't learn anything Donald Trump does learn things but Mitt Romney just can't he never learns anything here is some you know lefty comes up approaches Romney with a camera and tries to get Romney on the record talking about I mean maybe it was a right-winger I don't know talking about never Trump you know President Trump is you know or rather Mitt Romney is going to go to the United States Senate he's gonna have to work with Trump so whoever it is left or right winger has the camera there and you hear this question come out from you know all the other press who are there with the microphones and they say what about never Trump here's his answer well I don't think that was the case the President Trump was not the person I wanted to become the nominee of our party but he's president now the policies he's promoted have been pretty effective and I support a lot of those policies when that then there's a place where I disagree I point that out but right now we're in a race to say are we going to have a nation that is going to be guided by conservative principles where we get a dick a sharp turn left turn left vote any conservative principles work and that's my people I think are given get behind martha mcsalley and across Republican suppression getting you there's the Mitt Romney answer there it is they say you were the leader of never Trump he was the leader of never Trump Mitt Romney was the former presidential nominee of the Republican Party he came out he called Trump a liar and a fraud he said his promises are worth as worthless as a degree from Trump University by the way it turns out President Trump has kept more promises than virtually any president in recent history and but he came out of me he gave that speech that blistering speech against Donald Trump and and he didn't vote for Donald Trump he was the face of the true never Trump movement and now what does he say well I wasn't the head of never Trump I never what are you talking about never troubles I never never Trump I'm gonna never never it from this reminds me he did this exact thing in 1994 when he was running for Senate in Massachusetts he was asked about the record of Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan and you know in the 1980s Reagan Bush here's his answer look I was an independent during the time of Reagan Bush I'm not trying to return to Reagan Bush same thing I was an independent during the time of Reagan but I'm not trying to return to Reagan Bush I was an independent during the time I've never Trump I'm not trying to return to never Trump look Mitt Romney comes from the squishy wing of the Republican Party his father George Romney came from that same wing the liberal you know kind of consensus middle part of the Republican Party but he always pretends to be something different when he's running for office Mitt Romney invented Obamacare he was the governor who installed Obamacare in his state and then he tried to pretend that he wasn't he's always running away from who he is it's the same problem that Liz Warren has I don't mean to beat up on Mitt Romney I'm sure he's a good guy but he just is so bad at this like he's so wrong on one issue be who you are if he if they had said well you know you lead never Trump what do you think now if they said that Tim and he said look yeah I was really anti Trump never Trump and then it turned out he's been a very good president yeah I guess I was wrong I'm glad I got that one wrong and I can't wait to continue this great conservative success when I'm in the US Senate that would be a great answer still be a little skeptical of Romney but at least he's being honest at least he's being authentic but what he looks me in the eye and he tells me that reality isn't as it is if in that 94 election he thought that being a conservative was a risk in that 94 election against Ted Kennedy guess what he lost the election of course he lost the election but if he came out here they said what do you think of Reagan Bush and he said I thought things went great during Reagan Bush and I think the reason that we're we've seen an economic boost is because of the policies of Reagan Bush and I think we defeated the Soviet Union which by that time had been defeated because of Reagan Bush yeah if returning to Reagan Bush means winning the Cold War and having peace and prosperity you're damn right I'm a supporter of Reagan Bush if he had said that he would have had a fighting chance if you stand in the middle of the road you are going to get hit by a truck this is a fact of politics he's doing the same thing again he's gonna win this sentence eat but it's really frustrating it's really really unfortunate speaking of polls by the way before we get on to the cause of the death of political correctness I want to point out an important poll that matters no I'm not talking about Missouri no I'm not talking about Indiana no I'm not talking about Texas all of which show significant movement in the direction of the Republican candidate after Brett Kavanaugh I'm not talking I'm talking about first man you saw this movie with Damien Chazelle came out over the weekend and you know Ryan Gosling movie about Neil Armstrong landing on the moon and it's one of these blockbuster Oscar bait movies and it flopped at the box office now there had been some controversy with this movie because they don't shown the alarm strong planting the flag on the moon why didn't they do that I don't know I sort of suspect it's because they want to cozy up to Chinese audiences and overseas audiences which you're going to constitute a lot of it's profit but Ryan Gosling did an interview and he said oh you know it's was a human achievement it's not an American achievement and this really irritated half the country so is watching these box office returns pretty closely because I thought you know if this is a monster win at the box office conservatives aren't as influential as I thought we were concert' the the raw feeling of patriotism wouldn't be as big and this thing flopped it only made I think what is it sixteen million over the week sixteen seventeen million should have made a lot more money than that that's an important poll polls are notoriously unreliable especially generic polls especially national polls I think that polls pretty reliable this movie should have been a hit the only explanation I can come up with is that Americans don't want to see Hollywood disrespect them anymore they don't want to see elites disrespect them anymore they don't want to be pushed around twenty-two days until the election that's an important data point and I I think I know why the tide turned there was this study that came out at the end of last week it showed that eighty percent of Americans oppose political correctness they think that it's a danger to the country eighty percent this is an all-time high in the 1990s the number was fifty three percent opposed PC and then it rose even as late as 2016 polls put it about seventy three percent now it's up to 80 percent consider political correctness a serious problem in the country why is that I think the answer is transgenderism I actually think that's the one that put it over because you know it's one thing to say you have to say happy holidays instead of Merry Christmas my roll your eyes you say man that's stupid I mean it's the holidays Christmas but we're all right whatever it's quite another thing to follow a guy's daughter into the changing room at the swimming pool because you say that men can be women and women can be men that's a very different thing sex is essential to our identities in the beginning God created man male and female he created them this is a raw part of us we've got a lot of hormones pumping through our body the attraction for men to women and women to men is essential to the human condition it's enjoyed by at least 97 or 98 percent of the population it's it it really matters it really moves people I think that's what this about there was a story that came out from the women's cycling tournament the UCI masters Track Cycling World Championship this transgender dude who now is pretending to be a woman won the Women's Championship surprise surprise Rachel McKinnon is the name Rachel McKinnon tweets out quote lots of transphobic bigots are responding to my world championship wins saying next up the Paralympics hey women you realize all these people many of them women are comparing you to disabled people right Wow offensive because this person this guy Rachel McKinnon is trying to distract from the fact that he a man with a biological advantage took a prize away from women who should have won because it's a women's competition because it's a women's competition he actually or look we've been predicting this forever and it's happened frequently too he actually responded because people said look you have a biological advantage he said quote focusing on performance advantage is largely irrelevant because this is a rights issue we shouldn't be worried about trans people taking over the Olympics we should be worried about their fairness and human rights instead but it's a sports competition sports competition is about physical prowess he says that people are comparing women to the disabled in the analogy about the Paralympics women do have a handicap there is a handicap when men are competing against women men are stronger this guy Rachel MacKinnon tweeted out he said we don't know why men do better at sports than women we don't know it's really complicated it's not complicated men are stronger than women that's why even because then their response is always well Michael you're not exactly an Adonis you're not a strong guy you're not physically fit right I know I could still beat up virtually any woman I don't want to I never want to do that god forbid I that ever happens I'm just telling you men are stronger than women I think that there is this idea this crazy ideology especially among Millennials that oh well you know men generally are stronger than women but look there are a lot of women could beat up guys there are not a lot of women who could beat up guys there were virtually no women who could ever beat up any guy it of people you know I don't know maybe something like eight-year-old boy or something but people who are vaguely in the same age-range it virtually can never happen because men simply are stronger than women this is a biological fact and they're denying this biological fact and I think it cracked political correctness because I can look with my own two eyes and I can see that a guy is not a woman and that a woman is not a man and and when you when that lie is exposed when that essential lie is exposed all the other ones for you think oh maybe illegal aliens aren't really undocumented dreaming dreamer sleeping dreamers maybe a future or documented American maybe those lot maybe it isn't true maybe that falls apart I think you're seeing the crack up of political correctness and I would encourage people we're talking about earlier president Trump's political kind of gut reaction look at where he goes on the issues I think there you're gonna find where people resonates strongly because he doesn't think about politics from the perspective of Edmund Burke or Russell Kirk or Michael Oakshott or even Bill Buckley or whatever he's thinking about it from a really gut level from a media level from an information level and what did he focus on political correctness immigration those are the big issues in the 2016 campaign and we're still seeing that really resonates with people the lies of political correctness justice injustice protecting our borders protecting our country really good news for Republicans from all of those polls but look around because in the next 22 days you're gonna see polls get manipulated try to suppress conservative votes try to boost left-wing activism and left-wing boats look around for that because it is bound to happen but we will be here drinking our powwow tears our powwow Chow tears and smiling because right now people should be cautiously hopeful come back tomorrow in the meantime I'm Michael Knowles this is the Michael Knowles show I will see you know I won't see you
