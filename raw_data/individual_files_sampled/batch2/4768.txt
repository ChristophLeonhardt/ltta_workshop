welcome back tonight I'm obsessed with obituaries not just any obituaries it's the obituaries the New York Times has written or more to the point the obituaries that the New York Times hasn't written today on International Women's Day The Times conceded what has been obvious to many over the years their obituaries have disproportionately honored men mostly white men sometimes put it in a piece called overlooked they chronicled the lives of such history-making achievements as the inventor of a stovetop stuffing and the namer of slinky yet women who made a real contribution to society we're not seen as news that was fit to print until today today for the first time The Times published obituaries of 15 women women like Ida B Wells an african-american journalist in the late 19th century who wrote somebody must show that the afro-american race is more sinned against than sinning and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so about women like Diane Arbus the photographer of people living on the edges of society the mentally disabled transvestites circus performers or women like Sylvia Plath the poet and wife of the poet Ted Hughes whose work was largely ignored by male editors and whose brilliance was only recognized after her suicide by the way The Times is welcoming readers to nominate other candidates for overlooked obits this is quite the thing they're embarking upon and I tell you were the ones that are benefiting it's been it's a great treat to read more history and a more complete record of everything we'll be right back hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
