1
00:00:00,263 --> 00:00:02,098
MAKING REMARKS ON MOTHER'S DAY

2
00:00:02,098 --> 00:00:05,768
SPECIAL ALONG WITH MERCEDES

3
00:00:05,768 --> 00:00:08,337
SCHLAPP AND KELLYANNE CONWAY.

4
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:09,906
>> TODAY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION

5
00:00:09,906 --> 00:00:11,140
OFFICIALS WILL HOLD BRIEFING ON

6
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,809
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PLAN TO LOWER

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,480
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,285
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO REWARD

9
00:00:22,285 --> 00:00:28,090
COMPANY THAT CONSTANTLY RAISES

10
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:28,558
PRICES.

11
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:30,393
DISCOUNTS SHOULD BE PASSED ONTO

12
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:31,761
CONSUMERS AND PATIENTS.

13
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:33,996
CARLEY: LATEST MOVE AS THE TRUMP

14
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:36,799
ADMINISTRATION TRIES TO FIX A

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,601
BROKEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, WHAT

16
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,169
ARE THE STEPS THEY'VE TAKEN,

17
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:43,072
HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN FOX NEWS

18
00:00:43,072 --> 00:00:45,675
MEDICAL DR. MARK SIEGEL.

19
00:00:45,675 --> 00:00:47,643
DOCTOR, WHAT CAN WE EXPECT TO

20
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:48,444
HAPPEN HERE.

21
00:00:48,444 --> 00:00:50,112
WHEN MY PARENTS WERE SICK THEY

22
00:00:50,112 --> 00:00:53,316
WERE ON 5 TO 10 MEDICATIONS AT A

23
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:55,918
TIME AND COULD BE EXPENSIVE

24
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:58,054
ESPECIALLY ON PEOPLE WITH FIXED

25
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:58,387
INCOME.

26
00:00:58,387 --> 00:00:59,722
WOULD THEY SEE THE COST OF

27
00:00:59,722 --> 00:01:00,857
MEDICATION DECREES?

28
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:03,326
>> ABSOLUTELY, CARLEY.

29
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:04,626
ALREADY POINTED OUT ONE OF THE

30
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:06,762
THINGS YOU WILL SEE THE

31
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,130
MIDDLEMAN WILL GET LESS TO HAVE

32
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,332
PROFIT, MORE TO HAVE SAVINGS

33
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:11,067
WILL COME TO THE PATIENT, LIST

34
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,169
PRICES OF DRUGS ARE SKY HIGH,

35
00:01:13,169 --> 00:01:14,837
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OVER

36
00:01:14,837 --> 00:01:15,538
$300 BILLION A YEAR IN THE

37
00:01:15,538 --> 00:01:17,340
UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW.

38
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,076
FALSELY INFLATED LIST PRICES

39
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:22,078
LEADS TO MIDDLEMEN COMING IN AND

40
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:23,579
GOUGING OUT THEIR PROFIT BUT THE

41
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,715
PATIENT PAYS MORE OUT OF POCKET.

42
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:27,083
ALL OF THAT IS BEING CUT DOWN

43
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:27,516
ON.

44
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,585
THERE'S GOING TO BE LESS HIDDEN

45
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,020
PRICES, PRESIDENT TRUMP TALKED

46
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,154
ABOUT MORE PRICE TRANSPARENCY

47
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:33,823
WHERE YOU WILL KNOW WHAT

48
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:35,191
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ACTUALLY COST

49
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:37,193
AND REBATES WILL COME INTO PLAY

50
00:01:37,193 --> 00:01:39,195
SO THAT PRICES WON'T BE AS

51
00:01:39,195 --> 00:01:40,096
INFLATED.

52
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,865
AGAIN, LESS OUT OF POCKET

53
00:01:42,865 --> 00:01:43,900
PAYMENT BY THE PATIENT.

54
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,134
CARLEY: YOU SAY COMPETITION IS

55
00:01:45,134 --> 00:01:47,069
ALSO KEY.

56
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:47,803
>> WELL, COMPETITION IS KEY.

57
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,105
THIS IS HOW COMPETITION WILL

58
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:50,973
COME INTO THE EQUATION, MORE

59
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:52,808
GENERIC DRUGS APPROVED.

60
00:01:52,808 --> 00:01:54,911
FDA IS WORKING ON THAT.

61
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:56,312
LEST YEAR OVER A THOUSAND NEW

62
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:58,614
DRUGS WERE APPROVED THAT WERE

63
00:01:58,614 --> 00:01:59,982
GENERICS, MOST ON RECORD EVER,

64
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:01,817
WHY, IT'S GETTING EASIER AND

65
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:03,819
EASIER FOR GENERIC TO BE

66
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:04,253
APPROVED.

67
00:02:04,253 --> 00:02:06,355
WHY DOES THAT BRING DOWN PRICES,

68
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:07,890
BECAUSE GENERIC DRUGS ARE

69
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,824
CHEAPER, INSTEAD OF BRAND-NAME

70
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:11,160
DRUG BEING ABLE TO HOLD TO THE

71
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,828
MARKET LONGER, CHEAPER DRUGS

72
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:16,699
WILL COME IN AND COST LESS, HUGE

73
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:17,700
IMPROVEMENT AND PRESIDENT TRUMP

74
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,135
IS DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT.

75
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:20,903
CARLEY: LET'S GET A GRAPHIC OF

76
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:23,506
WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN WILL

77
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:25,207
INCLUDE, LOWER DRUG COSTS FOR

78
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:26,142
SENIORS, PERSUADE OTHER

79
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:30,379
COUNTRIES TO PAY MORE, REQUIRE

80
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:32,882
PRICE SHOWN IN DRUG ADS AND BAN

81
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:35,017
GAG CLAUSES FOR PHARMACIES AND

82
00:02:35,017 --> 00:02:36,686
END THE PATIENT GAINS.

83
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:39,288
THE ONE THING THAT I FOUND

84
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:41,424
INTERESTING, THE GAG CLAUSE

85
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:43,125
SITUATION WHERE PHARMACISTS

86
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,227
COULDN'T TELL ABOUT LOWER-COST

87
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:46,629
DRUGS, WHY DID THAT EVER HAPPEN

88
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:49,131
TO BEGIN WITH?

89
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,167
>> THAT'S IN BENEFIT OF

90
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,702
BRAND-NAME DRUGS.

91
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:54,036
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU

92
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:55,604
THERE WAS AN ALTERNATIVE.

93
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:56,706
CAN YOU IMAGINE AN ENTIRE

94
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:58,074
COUNTRY LIKE GERMANY COMES INTO

95
00:02:58,074 --> 00:02:59,475
PLAY AND SAYS, WE ARE ONLY

96
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,610
PAYING THIS AMOUNT FOR YOUR DRUG

97
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,579
AND DRUG MANUFACTURERS SAY,

98
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:05,581
SURE, OKAY, YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF

99
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:06,816
CUSTOMERS, WE WILL ACCEPT THAT

100
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:08,484
AND PASS IT ALONG TO PEOPLE BACK

101
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:08,918
HOME.

102
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:10,619
THAT'S GOING TO BE ENDED NOW.

103
00:03:10,619 --> 00:03:12,021
CARLEY: ALSO AMAZING HOW

104
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,990
EXPENSIVE DRUGS HAVE GOTTEN OVER

105
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,459
THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.

106
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:18,761
IN 2006 AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF

107
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:20,262
MEDICATION, $4,000, BY 2015,

108
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:24,100
THAT HAD TRIPLED TO NEARLY

109
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,068
$13,000, HOW COULD THAT HAVE

110
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,504
HAPPENED OVER SHORT PERIOD OF

111
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:29,038
TIME?

112
00:03:29,038 --> 00:03:30,206
>> MANUFACTURERS SAY IT'S

113
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:31,874
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, THAT'S

114
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:34,010
THEIR EXCUSE, BUT THEN THEY ARE

115
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,312
PASSING THE COST ALONG TO US,

116
00:03:36,312 --> 00:03:37,546
NOT ALONG TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES

117
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:41,317
AND YOU HAVE THE MIDDLEMEN THAT

118
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:45,488
COME AND PRICE GOUGE.

119
00:03:45,488 --> 00:03:46,722
PRICE TRANSPARENCY.

120
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:47,923
SENIORS ARE BEING TARGETED TO

121
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:49,592
GET MORE BENEFITS.

122
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:50,826
CARLEY: YEAH, THOSE ARE THE

123
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:52,228
FOLKS THAT SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE

124
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:53,896
A LOT OF SENIORS CAN'T REALLY

125
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:54,397
AFFORD IT.

126
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:55,431
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF

127
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:56,799
PEOPLE CARE ABOUT BECAUSE IT

128
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,167
AFFECTS THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR

129
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,969
FINANCES, SO IF THE PRESIDENT

130
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,171
CAN REALLY, YOU KNOW, CHANGE THE

131
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:03,706
SITUATION, IT WILL BE A MAJOR

132
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:05,374
WIN FOR THE TRUMP

133
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:06,042
ADMINISTRATION.

134
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,510
>> CARLEY, IF YOU'RE OVER 70

135
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,145
YEAR'S OLD AND ON FIXED INCOME

136
00:04:09,145 --> 00:04:12,548
AND GOING TO PHARMACY, THE LAST

137
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:14,483
THING YOU WANT TO BE TOLD, PONY

138
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:15,751
UP ANOTHER 50 BUCKS, YOU DON'T

139
00:04:15,751 --> 00:00:00,000
HAVE IT.
