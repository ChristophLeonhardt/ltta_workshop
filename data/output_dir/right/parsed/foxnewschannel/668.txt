EVEN THOUGH LIBERAL AUGUST
OF 2010.
REMEMBER THAT AUGUST OF 2010
SHE WAS CONFIRMED.
MEANWHILE, WE TALKED WEEK
AFTER WEEK ABOUT CIVILITY
AND INCIVILITY AND NOW WE
SEE MORE AND MORE CASES OF
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT BEING
ASSAULTED.
A MAN NOW CLAIMING HE WAS
ASSAULTED BECAUSE HE HAD A
TRUMP FLAG OUT IN HIS YARD
IN FLORIDA.
A LONG ISLAND MAN NOW WAS
ARRESTED IN THE LAST DAY OR
SO FOR MAKING THREATS TO
KILL A CAMPAIGN WORKER, A
VOLUNTEER, I BELIEVE, FOR
CONGRESSMAN LEE ZELDIN WHO
TWEETED THIS.
IN THE U.S. POLITICAL SCORES
ARE SETTLED AT THE BALLOT
BOX, THE CONGRESSMAN SAYS.
NOT BY TRYING TO KILL YOUR
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.
DONATO PANICO IS A GREAT
AMERICAN AND SUPPORTER OF @
REAL DONALD TRUMP.
AND ONE OF MY VOLUNTEERS.
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
TARGETED LIKE THIS TODAY FOR
HIS PASSION AND INVOLVEMENT.
PETE: SOMEONE DRIVES UP,
THEN HE GETS DRAGGED FOR
30 FEET AS THE GUY DRIVES
AWAY.
AND THEN OUTSIDE OF A
CAMPAIGN OFFICE, WE'RE NOT
JUST SCREAMING OR
PROTESTING, WE'RE LITERALLY
ASSAULTING AND THREATENING
THE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO WORK
ON CAMPAIGNS.
ABBY: HERE IS THE PROBLEM I
SEE THIS IS BECOMING THE NEW
NORM.
WE ARE SEEING THIS EVERY
SINGLE WEEK, MORE AND MORE
OF THESE STORIES HAPPENING.
WE ARE NOT EVEN NUT THICK OF
THE MID TERMS YET.
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
DURING THOSE DAYS AND THEN
PROUD OF THE PERSON YOU ARE
SUPPORTING.
I DO WORRY ABOUT WHERE WE
ARE AS A COUNTRY AND MAKING
THIS THE NORMAL AND THINKING
THIS IS OKAY.
THERE ASK THEM TO LEAVE A
RESTAURANT BECAUSE YOU DON'T
AGREE WITH WHO THEY WORK FOR
OR WHATEVER IT IS.
WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE A
WHAT MAXINE WATERS IS
SAYING.
WHAT SHE SAYS NOW IS
TRICKLING INTO THE POPULACE
OF THAT SIDE.
GOT TO BE CHUCK SCHUMER AND
NANCY PELOSI.
WE DID IT LAST HOUR.
THE JOB NUMBERS, EVEN NANCY
PELOSI SAYS WE HAVE GREAT
WHEN YOUR LEADER WON'T EACH
ACKNOWLEDGE GOOD ECONOMIC
DATA AND EVERYTHING IS EVIL
ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, NO
SURPRISE THAT THE RANK AND
FILE.
ABBY: WHY DOES SHE DO THAT?
THAT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE
PARTY.
THEY DON'T WANT TO
ACKNOWLEDGE THE PARTY IS
ED: BILL MAHER WANTS
RECESSION BECAUSE HE THINKS
IT WILL GET DONALD TRUMP OUT
OF OFFICE.
HE DOESN'T CARE IF THE
ECONOMY IS BAD FOR YOU.
ABBY: I WAS THINKING ABOUT
THAT THE OTHER DAY IF THERE
EATING HIS STEAK TARTAR, HIS
LIFE WOULDN'T CHANGE.
SO FOR HIM IT DOESN'T
