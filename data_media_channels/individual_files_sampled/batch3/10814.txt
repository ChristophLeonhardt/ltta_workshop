start this r2 with breaking news because the US Senate Intelligence Committee has sent a letter to Julian Assange asking him to testify on alleged Russian meddling in America's 2016 presidential election well let's get more details now from and see chocolate these are following the story for us from London a nasty a good afternoon to you just go through them what exactly is in this document well Andrew indeed the US Senate Intelligence Committee has sent a letter to the Ecuadorian embassy in London where as we all know that WikiLeaks publisher has been holed up for the last six years this letter is addressed to Julian Assange basically calling upon him to testify and what is being described as a closed interview at a mutually convenient time and location now given we all understand Julian Assange has made it clear he has no plans to be leaving that embassy anytime soon out of his own free will potentially this is going to be some kind of question-and-answer session that is probably going to be taking place via some kind of web link now to be clear the committee has clarified that the topic of this testimony would be Russian interference in the US elections of 2016 and we have seen the WikiLeaks or Julian Assange's legal team already react to this letter saying they would be open to this kind of testimony but it must conform to a high ethical standard so we'll be keeping an eye on when exactly this happens and whether or not some kind of information comes out of what is discussed sure why does the US believe that Assange should be central then to their investigation into those alleged actions by Moscow well this seems to fall into this us-led narrative that has been circulating widely especially in mainstream media basically saying that Russia had something to do with the u.s. elections when Donald Trump came to power and that Julian Assange had part to play in that because as we know of course just recently it's been said that 11 Russian intelligence officers had hacked into DNC servers they had taken some sensitive information allegedly passed it to Julian Assange who later published that information and despite Julian Assange himself having denied any of this countless times and numerous appearances it seems this is still a prevalent understanding in Washington so that's why they want to talk to him about it but Julian Assange has made his position clear a handful of times our source is not the Russian government and it is not the state party this is something a 14 year old kid a 14 year old kid I could have practice so the actor that they've tried to bring in is the Russian intelligence services Hillary Clinton stated multiple times falsely that 17 US intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications okay that's false well so now with WikiLeaks legal team saying Assange would not be against talking to them we might be able to get some more information in terms of Assange setting the record straight when it comes to the investigation being carried out by this US intelligence Senate committee okay thanks nasty answer choking her there for us in London well let's get their views now if Patrick Henson he's the year from the 21st century why.com and he's there waiting for us right now Patrick thanks for your time today what do you make of this then why do you think Senators are still calling for Assange to testify over these claims of Russian meddling even though he's repeatedly denied any links to the Kremlin yeah it is kind of puzzling why why they would want generally Assange to testify in these hearings his previous statements all pretty much refute the official story in the United States establishment in the US media and the democratic establishment so there's two two problems one of the main problems that they have the United States if they have Assange testify is that he may possibly give information that would destroy the sort of mainline conspiracy theory that the russians hacked the DNC servers and they stole the emails and handed them to WikiLeaks the whole Russia Gate case more or less more or less hinges on that sort of conspiracy theory so Julian Assange comes and testifies and you know destroys that narrative I don't know where that's going to lead the the current u.s. political polarization is it's completely wet to that narrative so is this maybe some other political forces at play in the United States is it are their moves being made possibly to you know put it put the cap on this whole Russia gate thing that's been going now for two years it's difficult to say it is I mean just on that point so we keep hearing that Russia's behind this but in fact former US intelligence officials do contend don't know that the dnc hack was an inside job it wasn't Russia sure Julian Assange himself alluded to this point a number of times over the last two years especially in the immediate aftermath of the incident as well so I think it would be very enlightening if he did testify I think it would be fantastic on many levels if it happened before the midterms it could have some kind of effect perhaps on the the results but then if it doesn't go one party's way they might blame Julian Assange for meddling in the u.s. midterm elections who knows or the Russians by extension but but so but if it's done by remote link then there's the issue of his safety exiting the embassy that's not going to be a big issue although that's on the table the discussions are happening now his lawyers are in talks with the Ecuadorian embassy and the Ecuadorian Embassy is guaranteeing his safety if if he is released they want the British authorities to guarantee his safety so there's there is some bargaining going on between Assange as camp Ecuador the UK and the United States there's a lot there's a lot of leverage here especially on Julian Assange side so there are deals to be made sure would you anticipate then that this orange would agree to testify I mean do you see it's in his interests I think it is absolutely in his interest I think he wants to testify he stated in previous occasions that he's willing to testify provided that the interactions and it meets a high ethical standard that might be a problem though in the United States because they seem to be having issues with anything of a high ethical standard at the moment in Washington so that's a slight slightly bit dicey there but if if he is if he is ejected or he does leave the embassy and he does so with some level of immunity that could also be something to look for in the future that he would step out with some level of immunity in in the agreement that he might testify on another around perhaps or another legal proceeding or another hearing it's difficult to say or another round of this current hearing which this doesn't seem to be like it's gonna finish anytime soon we're now in our second year but I think they'll they'll want to ring this Russia gate thing out at least until after the midterms sure before we go Patrick we should remind people there are plenty in the US do believe Russia was up to no good during these presidential elections in fact just last week heads of the US Intelligence and Security came up with a joint statement we can listen to that now it's in the crosshairs pain by Russia to try to weaken and divide the United States this threat is not going away to prevent foreign interference in our elections to prevent Russian and other foreign influence and the Russians try to hack into and steal information on candidates and government officials alike cyber attacks against voting infrastructure along with computer intrusions malicious cyber actors targeting elected officials that goes beyond the elections that goes to Russia's intent to undermine our democratic values lots of accusations but again no hard evidence is presented are we going to see any anytime soon do you think no we're not we're not gonna see any because if there was any hard evidence I guarantee you it would have been on the table before the election or weeks or months in the run-up immediately to the election because if they had evidence it would have absolutely so you know killed the Donald Trump campaign in his tracks so it would have come out that there is no evidence we would have seen it by now and if you want any if there's any argument this isn't a partisan witch hunt just look at the ten Democratic senators who demanded that Julian Assange is Asylum be revoked in violation of international law all ten of them are Democrats so this is a completely a partisan witch hunt it's been so from the start and you know they the Democratic Party rather than having a come-to-jesus moment in a moment of self introspection and see what they did wrong in one of the worst presidential campaigns in history instead they immediately blamed Russia and covered up the meddling that was being done with by the Hillary Clinton camp with the DNC derailing the Sanders campaign and the Obama White House's role in that as well so I think that cover-up continues to this day so they really need to hold this into place as long as possible at least till after these midterm elections maybe until 2020 but that would be a disaster for their party okay we're gonna have to leave it there but good to talk to you that's Patrick Harrington from 21st century wired.com thank you well as we were hearing for six years now the WikiLeaks chief has been stuck in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London over fears he will be extradited to the US if he leaves the building some American politicians have even called to assassinate him here's a recap why his revelations have angered Washington my doctor but I think you're getting good medical care does the NSA collect any data on millions of nerve no sir what a Leakes walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service you you
