1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
so something that's come out recently is

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">Scientology has taken the stand to put</font>

3
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:06,240
forward their religion in advertisements

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,910
and to advertise on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> side bars of</font>

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,599
people's channels and furthermore

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,620
youtube drama mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,260
know how the true this is but on certain

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,410
profiles where people aren't partners

9
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,020
people who criticize the religionists

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">scientology whether it's constructive or</font>

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,099
not have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientology get the facts</font>

12
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,779
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

13
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,390
video now it was my latest one here we

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,570

15
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,430
yourself get the facts Scientology video

16
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,370
channel now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a video response to</font>

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">a video i did when i went to Hollywood</font>

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,340
last year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to where you apply</font>

19
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in Scientology and I gave a fair</font>

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,180
perspective I asked him<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I could</font>

21
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,649
interview him about it but of course

22
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,570
they they want to do that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fair</font>

23
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,010
enough they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a scale of plus</font>

24
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:01,980
102-101 like- 98 on nervousness and they

25
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,210
were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince me that i was</font>

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,549
nervous and insecure when in fact i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

27
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,619
in hollywood by myself traveling the

28
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,119
world trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out and reaching the</font>

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,650
people but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i gave a balanced</font>

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,720
perspective and gave my views so check

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,549
that video out my question to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is do</font>

32
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:17,610
you believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that religions should feel</font>

33
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,710
the need to advertise in such a way I

34
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,200
mean surely it's about people who find

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,970
it in their lives and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it</font>

36
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">friend in their face fine just ontology</font>

37
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,060
is trying to move<font color="#CCCCCC"> away from the fact</font>

38
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,090
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> business and I went there the</font>

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,409
only thing I got out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was being</font>

40
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked if I wanted a buy a book and to</font>

41
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,210
sign up and pay money and that gave me

42
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,560
the impression that it is all business

43
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,930
and furthermore do you think that

44
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,729
YouTube should give partners the option

45
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,680
of what they advertise on their channels

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,939
because if there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font>

47
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,040
channel which is advertised next to my

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,659
video it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be something that I</font>

49
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with when I was in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollywood I had</font>

50
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,710
stuff right in my face and I was able to

51
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">shrug it off and go you know what I'm</font>

52
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to cope by myself but there are</font>

53
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,469
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in life who may be dragged</font>

54
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,299
off the streets into this Scientology

55
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:02,790
Center who are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for something to</font>

56
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,250
reach out to and they could potentially

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,380
get sucked into it which<font color="#CCCCCC"> were good or</font>

58
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,660
bad it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that would happen on</font>

59
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,610
my channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about very sensitive</font>

60
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,989
issues and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people who</font>

61
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,500
come

62
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,240
for my videos to find out you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,220
comfort that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know they're not the</font>

64
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,050
only ones undergoing difficulties and

65
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,460
then if they've got sign on the side

66
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,040
saying get the facts for this religion

67
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,100
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't agree with it I</font>

68
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,660
think if advertisement is to be taken

69
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,220
seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

70
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,230
this youtube channels should be able to

71
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">choose what is advertising their channel</font>

72
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who use alternative music a lot</font>

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,830
in their videos ideally should have

74
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,930
adverts for<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative sort of stuff</font>

75
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,330
you know it appeals to them my channel

76
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is nothing to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Scientology and</font>

77
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,810
therefore I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want it on my channel</font>

78
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,940
so get it off there please now I'm

79
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking you I'm not having a go at</font>

80
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,790
Scientology but Scientology I prefer if

81
00:02:53,790 --> 00:00:00,000
you stayed off my channel
