00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:08,940

cauldron hi put a website<font color="#CCCCCC"> I write for by</font>

8
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,949
some kind of miracle because I've loved

9
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:18,449
that website for so many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

10
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,090
two years ago or so I managed wing a job

11
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,470
there I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that before and I</font>

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,880
felt like I was really being thrown in

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,140
at the deep end at first cuz I done a

14
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,670
lot of preparation and I prepare lots of

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,720
questions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's nothing like</font>

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,539
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason Isaacs or ray Fiennes or</font>

17
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,520
Julie Walters or even tom Felton and

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">jason oliver phelps and Devin Murray and</font>

19
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,550
all those people standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of</font>

20
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,260
you waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your questions most of</font>

21
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,430
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they asked were predictably</font>

22
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,469
about kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of character and how this</font>

23
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,170
film as a story fits into the other

24
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,850
films and how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works whether it's just</font>

25
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,379
a second part to the first film or

26
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,430
whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the last part in this</font>

27
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,930
huge series and I also wondered whether

28
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,760
like they have any sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of closure and</font>

29
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,199
stuff like that I put a link down here

30
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:53,489
where you can find most of the video and

31
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,140
interviews that we did I also took loads

32
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,760

33
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,899

42
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,600
