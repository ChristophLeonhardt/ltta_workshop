125
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:43,870
>> I WAS EXCITED AND ELATED

126
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,372

00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,612
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW.

132
00:03:52,612 --> 00:03:55,082
SO I WAS I-I ACTUALLY

00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:55,849
GOOGLED HER.

134
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,250

BECAUSE, WITHOUT HER, MY SON

140
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,157
WOULDN'T HAVE THE

141
00:04:04,157 --> 00:04:05,225
OPPORTUNITY TO WALK AGAIN.

142
00:04:05,225 --> 00:04:07,461
AND I CAN NEVER REPAY HER

143
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:07,728
FOR.

144
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:10,364

00:04:12,632 --> 00:04:14,034
YOU KNOW, THEY HAD SUCH A

148
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:14,835
TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED IN

149
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:16,202
THEIR LIVES AND THAT THEY

150
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:18,904
ARE USING IT TO MAKE SOMEONE

151
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:21,375
ELSE'S LIFE, YOUR LITTLE BOY

152
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,709
LAMONT'S LIFE BETTER.

00:04:25,078 --> 00:04:26,613
MIRACLE.

155
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:27,914
I SAID USING THEIR TRAGEDY

156
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:29,116
TO GIVE MIRACLES.

157
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:31,251
IT'S A MIRACLE TO BE ABLE TO

158
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,319
GIVE SOMEONE THE OPPORTUNITY

159
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,756
TO BE ABLE TO WALK AGAIN:

160
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:39,393
WE TAKE FOR GRANTED TO WHERE

161
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:41,061
NOW IT'S A NECESSITY TO

162
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:42,729
WHERE I HAVE TO CARRY HIM

163
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:43,063
AROUND.

164
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:45,332
YOU UNDERSTAND?

165
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:46,900
IF HE WASN'T WE WOULD HAVE

166
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,236
TO CARRY HIM AROUND.

167
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:50,637
SO, IT'S A BLESSING.

168
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,639
>> Martha: HE IS A BLESSING.

169
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:52,973
LAMONT.

170
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:55,108
