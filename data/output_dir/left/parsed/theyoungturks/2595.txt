ALTHOUGH REPUBLICANS IN THE
HOUSE AND SENATE HAVE DONE
WHATEVER THEY CAN TO KILL NET
NEUTRALITY MANY STATES ARE NOW
STEPPING FORWARD TO REASSERT
THESE PROTECTIONS FOR INTERNET
CONTENT AND ACCESS TO THE
INTERNET.
THIS WEEK THANKFULLY WE ARE IN
CALIFORNIA AND WE GET TO
TALK ABOUT IT.
THE CALIFORNIA SENATE PASSED A
NET NEUTRALITY BILL OF ITS OWN.
IT'S NOT LAW YET BUT IT IS
AN IMPORTANT STEP.
THESE ARE THE
MOST IMPORTANT CORE PARTS OF NET
NEUTRALITY, THE PARTICULAR TYPES
OF CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS ARE
NOT BEING BLOCKED AND THEY ARE
NOT MANIPULATING THE SPEED OR
RELATIVE ACCESS YOU HAVE TWO
INFORMATION BASED ON
WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE BEEN
PAID BY THESE COMPANIES OR NOT.
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT, BUT ON
TOP OF 
THAT Ã± THIS IS OF COURSE
AN ISSUE THAT HAS THE VERY
BEGINNING GIVEN A LOT OF
MISINFORMATION.
YOU DON'T HAVE NEAR UNIVERSAL
SUPPORT FOR NET NEUTRALITY.
YOU DO HAVE MAJORITY SUPPORT
BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
CONVINCED THAT NET NEUTRALITY
IS A BAD THING.
I 
WOULD LOOK INTO WHO
THEIR DONORS ARE.
IT WILL NOW MOVE TO THE
STATE ASSEMBLY.
IT LOOKS LIKELY AT THIS POINT
THAT IT WILL SUCCEED BUT
DON'T TAKE YOUR EYE
OFF THE PRIZE.
WHAT IS GREAT AS IT IS
NOT JUST CALIFORNIA.
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF
NATIONWIDE GOOD NEWS ON AN
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE.
>>THIS IS HOW STATES LIKE
CALIFORNIA WHICH ARE
PROGRESSIVE CAN MAKE A
BIG DIFFERENCE.
WHEN WE HAVE DIFFERENT ADMISSION
STANDARDS, THEN YOU HAVE TO
FOLLOW THOSE EMISSIONS
STANDARDS.
WE WOULD BE THE SEVENTH LARGEST
ECONOMY IN THE 
WORLD IF 
WE
WERE A NATION.
SO MONTANA AND NEW YORK HAVE
DONE A GREAT JOB PASSING LAWS ON
THIS AND YOU CAN TELL IT IS NOT
A CONSERVATIVE OR LIBERAL ISSUE.
THE GOOD FOLKS IN MONTANA ARE
NOT KNOWN FOR BEING LIBERAL.
BUT EVERYBODY WANTS ACCESS.
OF COURSE WE ALL PAY MONEY
FOR INTERNET SERVICES.
SOME WEBSITES ARE NOT BIASED
TOWARDS SOME CUSTOMERS SO BOTH
CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS WANT
TO PROTECT THAT, IN THIS CASE
GREAT JOB FROM THE SENATE SIDE
OF CALIFORNIA.
THERE ARE SOME PROGRESSIVES THAT
HAVE BEEN PUSHED IN THAT
DIRECTION.
THAT IS WHY IT IS ALWAYS
IMPORTANT TO PUT PRESSURE ON.
AND JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE BAD
GUYS IN CHARGE AT THE FEDERAL
LEVEL DOESN'T MEAN YOU GIVE UP
OR LET IT FIZZLE OUT.
YOU ALWAYS FIGHT AND YOU
NEVER KNOW WHAT KIND OF A
DIFFERENCE IT CAN MAKE.
>>THE PRESSURE WILL BE
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.
HOPEFULLY SIMILAR BILLS
AND OTHER STATES.
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF BAD
NEWS UNFORTUNATELY.
WHAT WE HAVE BREWING HERE IS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND
IMPENDING CONFLICT
OVER THESE ISSUES.
WILL THE STATES BE ALLOWED TO
ESTABLISH THEIR OWN VERSION
OF NET NEUTRALITY?
OR WILL THE SEC BE ABLE TO
ASSERT DOMINANCE OVER THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ENDS UP
GOING TO AN APPEALS COURT, BUT
THAT FIGHT IS COMING AND YOU CAN
HELP INFLUENCE ITS EVENTUAL
OUTCOME BY PUTTING PRESSURE
ON PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND
ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW?
>>AND I WAS LED TO BELIEVE
CONSERVATIVES CARE DEEPLY
ABOUT STATES RIGHTS.
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN NOT AS MUCH.
BY THE WAY LET'S JUST REVIEW FOR
THE RECORD WHY THEY CARED
ABOUT STATES RIGHTS.
BACK WHEN STATES WANTED TO
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
AFRICAN-AMERICANS, REPUBLICANS
WERE ALL ABOUT STATES RIGHTS.
NOW THAT STATES WANT TO LEGALIZE
MARIJUANA AND MAKE SURE THE
INTERNET IS FREE FROM
INTERFERENCE AND IS THE SAME
INTERNET WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD, ALL
OF A SUDDEN IT'S LIKE WE ARE
JUST KIDDING.
ALL WE CARE ABOUT IS
THE MONEY LEBOWSKI.
