okay what am i doing now I really have
to come up with a good concept for for
what's going on with the Golden Globes
we're my studio it's a one-bedroom place
in the South Bay this is why I do my
work this is a ward season there's no
reason for me to not hit the Oscars and
the Grammys and all those other
awards shows there it's basically just
them patting themselves in the back I
would like to think that everyone that's
about to attend the Golden Globes is a
little uncomfortable right now because a
lot of people in Hollywood did know what
the hell was going on if Meryl Streep
who like embraced him and even called
him God if she didn't know what was
going on then she's a dumb bitch back in
the like 2000 or 1999 I snapped I turn
on my television on my radio and they're
telling me I'm a dick because I'm a
Republican I just said so who are the
Republican artists out there there were
none I said it I'm gonna do it
myself I'm not even a conservative I'm
just not a leftist I consider myself a
right-leaning 1960s liberal at the end
of the day we're really not defacing
anything or hurting anything we're just
putting up the whole point is to
take photographs document what we do
and then have it go viral hopefully
raaah what the is going on over
there over there over there carabiners
out don't pull too hard that's it we're
don't trip on the rope screw that car
behind us we got all day
 that's the best we can do man and
that is a cop act like you know what
you're doing we're now what
do we do straightness fast as you can go
without breaking law hope I know what
I'm doing because I only brought this
the reaction that I think I'm gonna get
is Hollywood scared to death right now
they don't know if they should be having
a party or if they should be in mourning
and when this happens I think they're
gonna freak out you've pretty much
crapped in their front door
you
you
