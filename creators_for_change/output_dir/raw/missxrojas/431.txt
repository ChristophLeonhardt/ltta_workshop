10
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,590
about that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was peculiar I didn't even</font>

11
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan it but I ended up wearing like some</font>

13
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,539
rather than black because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think black</font>

14
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,920
would have been a bit too intense for me

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,140
to handle alone let alone anyone else if

16
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,699
you know how itself was great because it

17
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,590
was really environmentally conscious

18
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,060
that's not something that you really

19
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,439
give a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time to think about when</font>

20
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,700
you're in that space<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your huge</font>

21
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,320
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these difficult decisions and</font>

22
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,940
all these very sad decisions they<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

23
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,590
a company that helped<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a lot with that</font>

24
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,719
casket itself was like this beautiful

25
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,730
wicker casket they didn't embalm him or

26
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,350
anything it was in this lovely wooded

27
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,940
area and there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of light even</font>

28
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,350
though it was a rainy day it smelt

29
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,289
beetle so it was a really nice event as

30
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:52,440
much as you know if funeral<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

32
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,890
sleep schedules a bit upside down I

33
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,120
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know what that's to do with</font>

34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,489
probably just jet lag really I've been

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,130
actually colored in another thing I did

46
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:21,930
is I went through some photographs and

47
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:24,450
printed up some really nice photos from

48
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,520

50
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:30,329
of the ones i printed was actually my

51
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,540
desktop background for a while which is

52
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,460
lots of us at the ball at<font color="#CCCCCC"> mickey cohen</font>

53
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,990
she can't really see very well because i

54
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,220
put this little frame on it and i had

55
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,680
this one which I really love of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Haley me</font>

56
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,509
and Sammy I turned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a black and</font>

57
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,860
white picture but I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> some photo</font>

58
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,270
paper and it worked out really well

59
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,009
these two were from the ball and then

60
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:49,590

61
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,579

72
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,849
