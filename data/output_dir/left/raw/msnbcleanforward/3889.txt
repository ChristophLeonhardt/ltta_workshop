people about Barbara Bush and the bushes

59
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,360
themselves and it certainly has struck

60
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,258
me his Barbara Bush was incredibly deep

61
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a level of decency to her that</font>

62
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,090
we miss I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public life a lot</font>

63
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,760
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but also the fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that she</font>

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,549
was so grounded<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even though that</font>

65
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:22,470
she was a former<font color="#E5E5E5"> first lady and while</font>

66
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,569
she was<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lady you wouldn't be at</font>

67
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">all surprised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you bumped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into her in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Aisle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three of a grocery store</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

69
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:32,580
that's completely true<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it wasn't just</font>

70
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,920
the common touch as people say I think

71
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">she was a person who felt very</font>

72
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,930
comfortable in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all levels of American</font>

73
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,140
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you know we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lost her</font>

74
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,670
and and so in a way it is a a sobered

75
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,310
day<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in a funny way not a sad one</font>

76
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,410
because what you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at with her</font>

77
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,010
is a great triumphant life one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of real</font>

78

effort and real achievement who had

79

considerable happiness and
