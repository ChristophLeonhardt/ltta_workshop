members of European Parliament have voted to reject a copyright law that could effectively ban means a couple of weeks ago the internet was introduced to a new bill that was going through the European Parliament that could have effectively banned memes what it would have meant is that websites would have been required to use artificial intelligence software that scanned content that uses uploaded and if it found copyrighted material then it would have just been scrapped so it essentially would have seen memes deleted from websites because we know the creation of means they take something that's in popular culture they add text to it edit it bla bla bla it's it's undoubtedly going to contain copyrighted material and it's not like the people who create the memes are making money from it anyway so the whole thing's a bit of a fast but it wasn't just me my artists that were concerned about this in fact the inventor of the Internet was concerned about this the BBC said the web's inventor Sir Tim berners-lee and others have expressed concerns about the proposed rules which they said threatened Internet freedom and they're right it does threaten Internet freedom you know the Internet has changed everything it's not just changed how we physically communicate in terms of we might now type it on a laptop or type it on our phones but it's also changed how we communicate we communicate not just through words we through images and through gifts and through emojis I mean it's all quite bizarre we're going back to this kind of hieroglyphic style way of communicating but it's what we do and jokes are found are hidden within memes jokes are hidden within graphics and taking away memes because they're copyright it changes once again exactly the way that we communicate through the internet so it's a big big thing and the latest news is that members of European Parliament have voted to reject the new bill which is fantastic news they've but at least they voted to reject it in its current form so that doesn't mean that the game is over I spoke to Johnny Sack inson an independent mep today and she told me nothing goes away it'll come back in September and even if rejected it will never die just be repackaged and represented the vote was tight two members voted 318 against and 278 in Fay so if the bill was to come back then it might well just get voted in but the main issue with this copyright law was article 13 which made media liable if users published unlicensed content so it would have been memes as in graphics but it also could have meant videos music and source code and a sticking point with this law is that it was actually in part designed to assist the music industry big stars like Paul McCartney have supported the bill because it would have protected record labels and artists in fact BPI music tweeted we respect the decision by M EPS to have a plenary discussion on the draft copyright directive we will work with M EPS over the next week's to explain how the proposed directive will benefit not just European creativity but also Internet users and the technology sector maybe beneath all the political and cultural implications here there's actually some legitimate concern the way we listen to music has changed we stream music we don't buy it individually anymore and because that industry's changed maybe the music industry does need some protection from online pirates so maybe there's some legitimate concern here but I don't for a moment think that as this bill keeps getting re presented to the European Parliament I don't think for a moment that the European Union is ever going to back down on banning memes the II used new copyright bill including article 11 and 13 might well have some good intentions regarding the music industry for instance but its attack on memes is completely transparent to me you know this just isn't just about protecting copyright this is a convenient excuse for a supranational authoritarianism fightback that we've been winning they know we use memes and they know that's how we win and while the MVPs might have voted against it this time it was a thin majority and what I'm Janice Atkinson MEP is right when she tells me that this bill is just gonna be repackaged and represented in no time we haven't won the second meme war yet it's just beginning you
