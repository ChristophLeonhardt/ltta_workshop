animals brought these folks
settle people down you can see a
difference in their expressions it purrs
they can feel that for people with
dementia it's very comforting to them we
don't try to tell them that it's not
real it's not you know we're living in
their life right now we're living in
their life what's going on girls how's
your lunch my name is Steven oudy and I
am the director of memory care here at
Plymouth crossings Plymouth crossings is
an assisted living community for folks
with memory care issues distrust me a
little bit that he was conversing with
something that wasn't real but it gave
him pleasure and that relaxed him and I
figured it's working so why not yeah I
like the cat now we both like the cat hi
dad
oh yeah Nancy I found it you're lucky he
loves you yeah who wants to take care of
the kitty you want to take the kitty
all right if you want to take care of
the other kitty okay we need to give
these guys some names it has something
to say about the cats but I don't know
what it is he's a sweetheart
it's just absolutely
sweetie some people don't have to worry
about having the animal fed although
they do try to feed them you hungry
the first one that we got was just was
like on a whim I just kept passing it in
the store
it would meow when it would roll over it
it would kind of flip it spar at me and
probably about the fourth or fifth time
after I walked by it on my visits to the
store I finally said are a hundred bucks
all right I'll buy I just assumed that
it was designed for kids so then we got
another cat we had somebody donate
another one after families saw you know
for one or two folks that we may take
aside who are not having such a great
day and we know that some of these
animals will help to settle them or help
get a smile out of them or help to get a
conversation going
I don't discourage them from thinking
that the animals are not real you know
they know that when they're finished
with the animal at any given time they
can give it back to us some people will
get anxious that that I gotta take care
of this cat I don't want to take care of
this cat you know so we will go back and
we'll take it I sit up you know I'll
take the cat to my house now and I'll
take care of it I'll bring it back
tomorrow
put them right next to you okay some
families were a little bit reluctant you
know I don't want you to lie to them
I said well but look how look how happy
it's making him to them in Israel
you
