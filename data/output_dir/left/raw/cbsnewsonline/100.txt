99
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,399

NICE, DON'T FEAR WHAT THEY'LL 

191
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,372
BE DOING IT TWICE. 

192
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,674
BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES WILL 

193
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,174
BE MATCHED UP AGAIN IN 

194
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:15,741
NOVEMBER. 

195
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,277
CAN WE EXPECT ANYTHING 

196
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:18,577
DIFFERENT? 

197

201
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,753

THE TURNOUT MODEL THAT PEOPLE

ARE ACCUSTOMED TO WILL PROBABLY 

206
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,360
TAKE EFFECT. 

207
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,161
YOU WILL SEE FAR MORE 

208
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:35,828
REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY SHOW UP TO

PEOPLE ARE STILL ON VACATION.

SCHOOL HASN'T STARTED YET.

213
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,569
BOTH SIDES ARE GRIPING ABOUT 

214
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,170
THE FACT THAT THIS WAS BEING 

215
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,703
HELD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 

216
00:06:44,703 --> 00:06:45,037
SUMMER. 

217
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,205
THE MAY HAVE A POINT. 

218
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:47,106
THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS KNOW IT 

219
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:50,243
WILL BE HARDER FOR O'CONNOR TO

00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,377
GET AHEAD COME NOVEMBER IF OR 

221
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,545
WHEN THERE IS A REMATCH. 

222

THEY BOTH SECURED THE 

223
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,449

>>> WE ARE GOING BACK TO A 

233
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:17,170
PRESS CONFERENCE. 

234
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,938
CHRIS COLLINS HAS BEEN CHARGED 

235
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,173
WITH SECURITY FRAUD. 

236
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:22,308
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN. 

237
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,777
>> HE LIED ABOUT IT TO LAW 

238
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,548
ENFORCEMENT TO COVER IT UP. 

239
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,584
ALSO CHARGED IS HIS SON, 

240
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:35,688
CAMERON COLLINS AND THE FATHER 

241
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:40,993
OF CAMERON'S FIANCC 

242
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,895
THESE CHARGES ARE REMINDER THAT 

243
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:46,531
THIS IS A NATION OF LAWS AND 

244
00:07:46,531 --> 00:07:48,935
THAT EVERYBODY STANDS EQUAL 

245
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:54,307
BEFORE THE BAR OF JUSTICE. 

246
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,841
NOT LIKE TO GO INTO THE DETAILS 

247
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:56,842
OF THE ALLEGATIONS A LITTLE 

248
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:57,677
MORE. 

249
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,713
IN ADDITION TO SERVING IN THE 

250
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:02,715
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 

251
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,717
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS WAS ALSO ON 

252
00:08:04,717 --> 00:08:09,421
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF A 

253
00:08:09,421 --> 00:08:15,327
COMPANY THAT IS PUBLICLY TRADED 

254
00:08:15,327 --> 00:08:18,097
THAT WAS DEVELOPING A DRUG FOR 

255
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,265
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. 

256
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,833
IN JUNE 2017, CONGRESSMAN 

257
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,902
COLLINS WAS TOLD SOME 

258
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,671
CONFIDENTIAL AND HIGHLY 

259
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,706
SENSITIVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE 

260
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:29,041
COMPANY. 

261
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,309
INFORMATION THAT WAS NOT YET 

262
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,343
MADE PUBLIC. 

263
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:36,148
NAMELY THAT THE MAIN DRUG, THE 

264
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,150
DRUG THEY WERE DEVELOPING TO BE 

265
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,519
THE BACK BONE OF THE COMPANY 

266
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,925
WAS A TOTAL FAILURE. 

267
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:46,892
THIS WAS DEVASTATING 

268
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:49,795
INFORMATION FOR THE COMPANY. 

269
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,896
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS HAD AN 

270
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,665
OBLIGATION TO KEEP THAT 

271
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,800
INFORMATION SECRET UNTIL THAT 

272
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,936
INTERMISSION WAS RELEASED BY 

273
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,006
THE COMPANY TO THE PUBLIC. 

274
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,507
HE DIDN'T KEEP IT SECRET. 

275
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:05,845
INSTEAD, AS ALLEGED, HE DECIDED 

276
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:06,512
TO COMMIT A CRIME. 

277
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:08,314
HE PLACED HIS FAMILY AND 

278
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,785
FRIENDS ABOVE THE PUBLIC GOOD. 

279
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,987
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS WAS A MAJOR 

280
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:19,358
INVESTOR AND SO IS HIS SUN -- 

281
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:19,558
SON. 

282
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,527
THE CONGRESSMAN KNEW HE 

283
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,029
COULDN'T SELL HIS OWN SHARES 

284
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,329
FOR PERSONAL AND TECHNICAL 

285
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:27,466
REASONS INCLUDING THAT HE WAS 

286
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,868
ALREADY UNDER AN INVESTIGATION 

287
00:09:29,868 --> 00:09:32,104
REGARDING INNATE  BY THE 

288
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,940
CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS OFFICE. 

289
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,610
THE CRIME THAT HE COMMITTED WAS 

290
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,149
TO TIP HIS SON SO THAT CAMERON 

291
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,283
AND A FEW SELECT OTHERS COULD 

292
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:47,753
TRADE ON THE NEWS WHILE THE 

293
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,288
INVESTING PUBLIC REMAINED IN 

294
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:50,422
THE DARK. 

295
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,425
AS THIS ALLEGES, THAT'S EXACTLY 

296
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,796
WHAT THEY DID. 

297
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,898
HIS SON, SOLD. 

298
00:09:58,898 --> 00:09:59,965
HIS FIANCC SOLD. 

299
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:04,637
THE FATHER OF THE FIANCC SOLD. 

300
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,038
HIS WIFE SOLD. 

301
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,407
OTHER FRIENDS AND RELATIVES 

302
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:10,910
SOLD. 

303
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,945
AND THIS WAS ALL BECAUSE 

304
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,413
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS VIOLATED 

305
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,917
HIS DUTY TO KEEP INNATE'S 

306
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,618
INFORMATION  SECRET. 

307
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:22,989
AND WHEN THE NEWS BECAME PUBLIC,

308
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:25,524
THE STOCK PLUMMETED. 

309
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:27,960
THE CONSPIRATORS USED THE 

310
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,933
INSIDE INFORMATION TO AVOID 

311
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:36,135
OVER $750,000 IN LOSSES. 

312
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,804
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS COULDN'T 

313
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:42,475
KEEP HIS CRIME A SECRET FOR 

314
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,275
EVER. 

315
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:44,310
THE FBI ASKED TO INTERVIEW HIM 

316
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,411
AND INSTEAD OF TELLING THE 

317
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:46,045
TRUTH, HE LIED. 

318
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,147
AND SO DID CAMERON COLLINS. 

319
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,418
AND SO DID STEPHEN ZARKSY.  

320
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,186
BY LYING TO THE FBI, THEY 

321
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:57,823
COMPOUNDED THE CRIME WITH THE 

322
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,960
CRIME OF CRIMINAL COVER-UP. 

323
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,665
NOW I WOULD LIKE TO GO OVER THE 

324
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,866
CHARGES THAT SUMMARIZE SOME OF 

325
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,168
THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE 

326
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,672
INDICTMENT. 

327
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,277
THIS IS A TIPPING CHAIN. 

328
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:21,881
IT DEMONSTRATES THE FLOW OF THE 

329
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,350
ILLEGAL INSIDER INFORMATION AND 

330
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:32,491
THE TRADING OF THAT INFORMATION.

331
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:37,396
AT THE TOP OF THAT CHAIN WAS 

332
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,397
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS.  

333
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:42,067
SHE RECEIVED CONFIRMATION -- 

334
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:45,871
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. 

335
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,040
IN TOTAL, THE DISREGARD OF THAT 

336
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,143
OBLIGATION, MINUTES AFTER 

337
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,412
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  RECEIVED 

338
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,447
THE DEVASTATING, HIGHLY 

339
00:11:55,447 --> 00:11:59,518
CONFIDENTIAL NEWS THAT INNATE'S 

340
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:01,387
DRUG HAD FAILED THE TRIAL, 

341
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,023
CONGRESSMAN COLLINS  TIPPED 

342
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,092
THAT INSIDE INFORMATION TO HIS 

343
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:08,794
SON SO THAT HIS SON COULD TRADE 

344
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:10,563
IT. 

345
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,365
CAMERON COLLINS, WHEN HE 

346
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,868
RECEIVED THAT ILLEGAL INSIDE 

347
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:18,671
INFORMATION, HE DID TWO THINGS. 

348
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,706
BOTH OF WHICH ARE ILLEGAL. 

349
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:24,343
HE SOLD STOCK BASED ON THAT 

350
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:29,682
INSIDE INFORMATION AND AVOIDED 

351
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,250
$570,000 IN LOSSES. 

352
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,285
AND HE ALSO TOOK THAT ILLEGAL 

353
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,386
INSIDE INFORMATION AND TIPPED 

354
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,823
OTHERS. 

355
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:40,326
HE TIPPED HIS FIANCC. HE 

356
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:44,630
TOPPED -- TIPPED HIS FIANCC'S 

357
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,365
FATHER AND A FRIEND. 

358
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,401
ALL OF WHOM TRADED ON THAT 

359
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:53,138
ILLEGAL INSIDE INFORMATION. 

360
00:12:53,138 --> 00:12:59,645
STEPHEN ZARSKY AVOIDED $143,000 

361
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,514
IN LOSSES BY TRADING ON THAT 

362
00:13:02,514 --> 00:13:02,948
INFORMATION. 

363
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,217
AND HE TIPPED OTHERS. 

364
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,419
HE TIPPED HIS BROTHER. 

365
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,021
HE TIPPED HIS SISTER. 

366
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,389
AND HE TIPPED A FRIEND. 

367
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,892
TWO OF WHOM TRADED ON THE 

368
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:13,225
INFORMATION. 

369
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,827
ONE ATTEMPTED TO TRADE ON THE 

370
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,997
INFORMATION BUT WAS UNABLE. 

371
