1
00:00:01,289 --> 00:00:03,191
NORTH KOREA.

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:04,359
>> Shannon: DID RAISE EYEBROWS

3
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:06,160
ON ALL SIDES OF THIS

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,594
CONVERSATION.

5
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,630
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,798
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DIRECTOR OF

7
00:00:10,798 --> 00:00:12,567
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JAMES

8
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,168
CLAPPER OFFERING RARE PRAISE FOR

9
00:00:14,168 --> 00:00:14,969
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S UNUSUAL

10
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:15,637
DIPLOMATIC APPROACH TO HIS

11
00:00:15,637 --> 00:00:17,772
NORTH KOREAN COUNTERPART.

12
00:00:17,772 --> 00:00:20,308
>> THIS IS TYPICAL NORTH KOREAN.

13
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:23,745
ONE STEP BACK, -- TWO STEPS

14
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:24,479
FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK, THAT'S

15
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:26,347
WHAT THEY ALWAYS DO.

16
00:00:26,347 --> 00:00:28,616
IN SOME WAYS HE MAY HAVE MET HIS

17
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:30,952
MATCH OR WITH A VERY

18
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:31,586
UNCONVENTIONAL PRESIDENT.

19
00:00:31,586 --> 00:00:32,987
>> Shannon: LET'S BRING IN

20
00:00:32,987 --> 00:00:34,155
CLIFF MAY FOR ANALYSIS,

21
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:35,523
PRESIDENT OF THE FOUNDATION FOR

22
00:00:35,523 --> 00:00:36,090
DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY.

23
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,759
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US

24
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:38,092
TONIGHT.

25
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:44,532
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF FORMER DNI

26
00:00:44,532 --> 00:00:45,967
CLAPPERS STATEMENT THAT HE MAY

27
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,168
HAVE MET HIS MATCH.

28
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,970
>> COMING FROM JAMES CLAPPER

29
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,939
THAT'S QUITE A COMPLIMENT FOR

30
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:52,573
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

31
00:00:52,573 --> 00:00:53,241
HE OBVIOUSLY DOES DIPLOMACY

32
00:00:53,241 --> 00:00:54,842
UNCONVENTIONALLY AND I THINK

33
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:56,744
WHAT CLAPPER IS SAYING IS MAYBE

34
00:00:56,744 --> 00:00:59,580
THIS IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT

35
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,581
THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD IN THE

36
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:01,349
ADMINISTRATION FOR THE

37
00:01:01,349 --> 00:01:02,350
DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THAT OR THE

38
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,251
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE THAT

39
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:05,086
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GOING BACK

40
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:07,121
AND FORTH NOT SUCCEEDING WITH

41
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,323
NORTH KOREA FOR ABOUT A QUARTER

42
00:01:08,323 --> 00:01:10,758
OF A CENTURY.

43
00:01:10,758 --> 00:01:11,826
>> Shannon: SO THERE ARE A

44
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:12,794
NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE

45
00:01:12,794 --> 00:01:13,561
CRITICAL TO US GETTING THIS

46
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:13,861
DONE.

47
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:17,665
WE SAW THAT THE TALKING WITH

48
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,233
PRIME MINISTER ABE, BUT WHEN IT

49
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,735
COMES TO CHINA, RUSSIA AND MANY

50
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:22,704
OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT

51
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:23,338
ESSENTIALLY ENFORCING THE

52
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:26,541
SANCTIONS IN FULL, WHAT PARTNERS

53
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,775
DO WE NEED TO GET ON BOARD IN

54
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:29,777
ORDER TO ACTUALLY MAKE SOMETHING

55
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:30,745
HAPPEN?

56
00:01:30,745 --> 00:01:31,813
>> THE HARDEST PARTNER AND THE

57
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:34,882
MOST CONSEQUENTIAL IS OF COURSE

58
00:01:34,882 --> 00:01:35,216
CHINA.

59
00:01:35,216 --> 00:01:38,753
CHINA HAS SEEN NORTH KOREA AS AN

60
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:39,988
ASSET.

61
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:41,155
IT'S A PITBULL.

62
00:01:41,155 --> 00:01:43,758
IT BARKS A LOT, IT BITES AT

63
00:01:43,758 --> 00:01:44,959
AMERICA'S LAKES.

64
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,793
IT KEEPS AMERICA DISTRACTED AND

65
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:47,395
IT REPRESENTS A THREAT TO

66
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:48,563
AMERICA AND CHINA IS SEEING THAT

67
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:49,564
IS A GOOD THING.

68
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:50,431
WHAT HAS TO CHANGE?

69
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:52,767
CHINA HAS TO SEE NORTH KOREA NOT

70
00:01:52,767 --> 00:01:54,168
AS AN ASSET BUT RATHER AS A

71
00:01:54,168 --> 00:01:54,535
LIABILITY.

72
00:01:54,535 --> 00:01:58,139
THAT'S NOT EASY, BUT IT'S NOT

73
00:01:58,139 --> 00:01:58,740
IMPOSSIBLE.

74
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,209
THAT'S GOING TO PROBABLY REQUIRE

75
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:02,276
PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING A LOT OF

76
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,144
ECONOMIC PRESSURE NOT JUST ON

77
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:05,580
NORTH KOREA, MUCH MORE THAN HE

78
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,382
HAS ALREADY, BUT ALSO ON CHINA

79
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:08,515
THAT WILL HURT CHINA, IT MAY

80
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:09,817
HURT THE U.S. AS WELL BUT UNLESS

81
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,185
HE SHOWS THAT HE IS WILLING TO

82
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:12,553
DO THAT AND A COUPLE OTHER

83
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:13,688
THINGS WE CAN TALK ABOUT, CHINA

84
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:15,957
IS NOT GOING TO SEE THIS AS ITS

85
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:18,393
PROBLEM TO SOLVE.

86
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:20,161
>> Shannon: I KNOW THAT

87
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:20,828
NORTH KOREA'S ECONOMY AMONG

88
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:21,629
OTHER THINGS IS VERY OPAQUE.

89
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,631
IT'S TOUGH FOR US TO GET A REAL

90
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:24,365
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE

91
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:25,366
AND THERE ARE SOME ACCOUNTS THAT

92
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:26,401
ARE READ TODAY THAT SET

93
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:27,635
FINANCIALLY THEY ARE NOT DOING

94
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:28,836
AS BAD AS PEOPLE WOULD THINK MAY

95
00:02:28,836 --> 00:02:31,205
BE THAT THEY ARE.

96
00:02:31,205 --> 00:02:32,407
THERE IS STILL CURRENCY FLOWING.

97
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:33,274
THEY HAVE GOTTEN WEAPONS THAT

98
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:34,776
ARE TRADING FOR AT MIDDLE EAST

99
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:35,877
THAT THE UNREST THERE ACTUALLY

100
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:38,379
BENEFITS THEM IN MANY WAYS.

101
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,881
>> THE STRATEGY OF THE PRESIDENT

102
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:40,448
HAS TALKED ABOUT WITH

103
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:41,949
NORTH KOREA -- BY THE WAY WITH

104
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:44,385
IRAN AS WELL, IT'S ONE OF

105
00:02:44,385 --> 00:02:44,886
MAXIMUM PRESSURE.

106
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:45,753
MAXIMUM PRESSURE MEANS THAT THE

107
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:48,189
U.S. ECONOMY IS SO STRONG WE CAN

108
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:49,724
PUT SUCH PRESSURE ON, SANCTIONS

109
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:53,428
NOT AS SLEDGEHAMMERS AT THE SIDE

110
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:55,296
OF THE HEAD THAT WE CAN CRUSH A

111
00:02:55,296 --> 00:02:56,798
FOREIGN ECONOMY LIKE

112
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:57,198
NORTH KOREA.

113
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,566
WE CAN MAKE IT CRUMBLE.

114
00:02:58,566 --> 00:02:59,434
SO THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS, CAN

115
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:01,335
WE ACTUALLY DO THAT?

116
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:04,272
AND WILL BE ACTUALLY DO THAT,

117
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:04,906
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEFORE.

118
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:06,974
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT AN

119
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:07,775
ANALOGY.

120
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,243
VERY TOUGH SANCTIONS ON IRAN

121
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:10,278
BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE

122
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:10,812
NEGOTIATING TABLE.

123
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:14,382
WE LIFTED THEM, PRESIDENT OBAMA

124
00:03:14,382 --> 00:03:15,750
LIFTED THEM.

125
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,586
THE ECONOMY OF IRAN WENT FROM

126
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:19,253
SUBSTANTIAL RECESSION INTO

127
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,022
RECOVERY AND WE NEVER GOT

128
00:03:21,022 --> 00:03:22,857
ANOTHER CONCESSION AFTER THAT.

129
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:23,524
ALREADY NORTH KOREA HAS HAD

130
00:03:23,524 --> 00:03:26,060
ABOUT A TWO MONTH RESPITE FROM

131
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,894
SERIOUS SANCTIONS AND IS

132
00:03:26,894 --> 00:03:28,963
PROBABLY GOING TO GET AS I

133
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:29,764
UNDERSTAND IT ANOTHER RESPITE

134
00:03:29,764 --> 00:03:31,766
BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 12TH.

135
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:33,267
I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS

136
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:35,837
TO PUT VERY TOUGH SANCTIONS ON

137
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:37,271
SO THAT KIM JONG UN LOOKS AROUND

138
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,973
AND SAYS MY ECONOMY COULD

139
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:40,341
ACTUALLY IMPLODE.

140
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:41,542
THAT WOULD BE DANGEROUS.

141
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,910
PLUS THE SKY TRUMP IS SO CRAZY

142
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,011
HE MIGHT EVEN USE MILITARY

143
00:03:44,011 --> 00:03:44,378
MEANS.

144
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:45,246
I DON'T WANT A MISSILE ON MY

145
00:03:45,246 --> 00:03:46,948
BREAKFAST TABLE.

146
00:03:46,948 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Shannon: THAT IS VERY
