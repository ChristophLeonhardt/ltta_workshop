00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
today is back to school day for wizards

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,710
and i have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say i am a bit jealous I</font>

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,080
kind of missed that first week of sep

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,269
tember feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> I miss going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> WH Smiths</font>

5
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,280
and picking out my pencil case or when I

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,690
was in my first year of secondary school

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,910
going to the cool korean stationery shop

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,560
and picking out the coolest<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue bear</font>

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,660
pencil case<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting my timetable</font>

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,189
and funny out who my teachers were and

11
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,689
if I'd been stuck with any rubbish one

12
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,820
and working out when PE was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,350
schedule as many orthodontist

14
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,029
appointments as possible in that time

15
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,310
period PE the only thing worse than the

16
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,019
orthodontist I<font color="#CCCCCC"> missed getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the books</font>

17
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,759
and the highlighters and the yearly

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,010
reminders that<font color="#CCCCCC"> tippex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was just not</font>

19
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:37,260
permitted banned substance and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

20
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">sec form everything felt a little bit</font>

21
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,350
cooler because you had those ring

22
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,590
binders and you had note paper and you

23
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:44,910
carried a hole punch with you everywhere

24
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,289
maybe that was just me actually

25
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,809
definitely just me the strange pride to

26
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,670
be taken in saying towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

27
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,649
first year at secondary schools revising

28
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,300
for my end of year exams felt very

29
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,770
important somehow the obligatory

30
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,480
complaints about having to put the

31
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,340
uniform on and my skirt is falling apart

32
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,140
but I can't buy a new one because there

33
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,329
would be so horribly long the peculiar

34
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,670
invocation to a new year that is the

35
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,500
assembly despite the fact that it's

36
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,299
September I feel like I'm still

37
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,130
structuring my life around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure</font>

38
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,350
of school I still feel like September's

39
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,810
in a year and a new time in a way that

40
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,700
January really isn't for me and I still

41
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,380
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like summer holidays are like a</font>

42
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,720
sacred time but everything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for</font>

43
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,939
like 18 to 20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your life how</font>

44
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,070
could it not be really but then quickly

45
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,200
of course and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see this if you go</font>

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,549
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my videos because i started</font>

47
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">making them when i was so much younger</font>

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,770
all too quickly overwhelmed stressed so

49
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,470
much homework felt so behind but so

50
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,210
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing you're not without</font>

51
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,860
need to be doing more too many

52
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,020
extracurriculars too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things on the</font>

53
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,979
brain so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> drama and nonsense and</font>

54
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,110
particulars bad bad choices so many

55
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,520
things I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I wouldn't come back</font>

56
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that people wouldn't forget or that</font>

57
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:54,659
I would never ever ever stop regretting

58
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,060
and I'm here now and I still look like

59
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">at that time with some fondness and I</font>

60
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,110
don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sick feeling in my</font>

61
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,759
stomach when I think about what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

62
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:04,680
to so and so what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

63
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">so-and-so that stuff goes it done and</font>

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,419
you learn I think I hope

65
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,150
not to overload yourself in that way if

66
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,310
you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hermione type you</font>

67
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,870
learned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> next year you probably</font>

68
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,700
won't use the time tab but then I've

69
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,989
also been<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking a lot recently about</font>

70
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:21,720
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky I was to be in I was in this</font>

71
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,489
one secondary school for seven years all

72
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:26,250
girls in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways it was tough and</font>

73
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,690
it was very competitive teachers and

74
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">pupils alike were kind of pushy in some</font>

75
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,950
ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that led to people being very</font>

76
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,290
stressed out and not very kind to

77
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,060
themselves and there wasn't enough

78
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,880
emphasis on self care but it was in so

79
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,220
many ways a really safe space very lucky

80
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,170
took one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a school where I felt safe</font>

81
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,989
and to have friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> in whose friendship</font>

82
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,880
groups I felt safe and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I could sit</font>

83
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,060
here now and reminisce about buying

84
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,459
rubbers and pencil cases and rulers

85
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">sweeps we at school I hope you all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a</font>

86
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,940
great train ride all the Hogwarts
