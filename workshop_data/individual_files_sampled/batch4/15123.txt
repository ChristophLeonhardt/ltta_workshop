did you join in on the hype of International Women's Day and Harvey Weinstein might be getting some new bracelets Jordan be Peterson's speech was met with hysterical idiocy all of that today on the rebel buzz all right to be candid I am not really clear on the sentiment behind International Women's Day don't get me wrong women are amazing I can personally vouch for that and we are a lot of things which absolutely deserve praise but I reject the notion that simply because I was born female that I deserve a day dedicated to my chromosomal content and configuration that precipitated my gender call me weird but I would rather be recognized for more I don't know legitimate reasons now don't get me wrong there are a lot of these recognition holidays that I support National Nurses Day National Teachers Day those days provide recognition for essential jobs that men and women alike perform diligently every single day but like I said I don't think that women we don't need a day every day that I work hard and were awarded for that hard work and talent is International Women's Day for me I'd rather not have a specific day dedicated to the fact that I was born female rather be recognized when worthy because of my merit not my gender so where did all this hullabaloo about Women's Day start it only recently seems popular here in the US but do not be disillusioned it's been around for a while oh yeah like literally since the days of Eastern European communism in fact the holiday itself is actually quite communist it was basically used as propaganda to spread the belief that communism is focused on gender equality on this day out of the year male bosses would give their female employees red flowers but what the holiday has turned into in Russia and other former Soviet blocks of the region is an amalgamation of Mother's Day and Valentine's Days tacky and commercialized and basically lacking any genuine intent to show appreciation for women or recognition of their equality in Russian culture so go ahead and wish someone a happy international win today but don't say it to me because I earned my recognition or I don't but I do not demand it on a calendar or on Twitter moving on Harvey Weinstein's sir you better take off that fancy Breitling watch you wouldn't want it to get scuffed by the handcuffs Cyrus Vance who is Manhattan da as he was taking office back in 2010 gave us a little foreshadowing when he said crimes committed by the affluent the powerful or by public officials will be investigated and prosecuted as vigorously as Street Crimes so will he make good on that promise well he seems to be the last to get on board a law enforcement source said that the DA's office is still investigating while Chief of Detectives seems confident that they have already compiled plenty of evidence in response Weinstein's attorney said this I have been assured that the filing of criminal charges against mr. Weinstein have not been authorized in his arrest is not imminent still clinging to his innocence huh so with all of the evidence mounting against Weinstein and all of the horror stories about experiences with him the final nail in the coffin might actually be an incident from back in 2004 when an aspiring actress lechia Evans claims that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex in his tribal Tribeca office sidenote I was at the Tribeca Film Festival that year so that's a little eerie for all of you Canadian rebels out there you probably have known the name Jordan V Peterson for a while but you have to forgive us Americans we are a little late to the party this time he gained popularity here in the US after millions of people viewed his interview with British journalist Kathy Newman if you know the interview I'm talking about you know that poor miss Newman she didn't fare so well she flat out looked like an idiot he kind of looks like a genius psychology rockstar and she looked ignorant and petty and overly sensitive not unlike the progressive left here in the u.s. so that interview was back in January but Peterson's name is back in the news as he has been on a logical thought tour bestowing reasonability on the ears and in the minds of all who come to hear him speak but of course there are exceptions there are always those few idiots Monday night during a speech at Queen's University the hysterics were out in full force beating and shattering stained-glass windows shouting lock them in and burn it down now keep in mind they are protesting a man who's legitimate views on gender roles and equality are the result of decades of study as a clinical psychologist he's not just some kooky all right firebrand media guy he's a medical professional but because they don't agree with him acts of violence and property damage are all on the table as appropriate and legitimate and justifiable reactions after the incident Peterson tweeted barbarians at the gate Queens you today reminiscent of the destruction of the stained glass on Pleasure Island in Pinocchio he then tweeted in an exchange with Joe Rogan it was absolutely surreal Joe the mob neglected to bring torches and pitchforks but the sentiment was there locked them in and burn it down so apparently it's not just here in the US apparently free speech has gone out of style everywhere including Canada I truly longed for the day when free speech in conjunction with sanity returns to our dear continent so stay safe Canada and good grief stay away from windows thanks so much for watching I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoy my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry
