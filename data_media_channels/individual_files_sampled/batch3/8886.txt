♪ ♪ Tucker: FOR MORE THAN A YEAR THE ONLY ESPIONAGE THREAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IS RUSSIA EVEN THOUGH THE WORST THING ANYONE HAS PINNED ON VLADIMIR PUTIN SO FAR IS A HANDFUL OF DOPEY FACEBOOK ADS THAT ALMOST NOBODY SAW BUT JUST BECAUSE THE RUSSIAN THREAT IS GROTESQUELY OVERBLOWN DOESN'T MEAN THAT FOREIGN SPYING IS IN A PROBLEM FOR US. IT DEFINITELY IS A PROBLEM. CHINESE SPYING IS THE REAL PROBLEM. CHINA IS OUR MAIN RIVAL ON THE WORLD STAGE. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SPIES ON US RELENTLESSLY. ON OUR COMPANIES, OUR MILITARY, OUR GOVERNMENT. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CHINESE NATIONALS WHO LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST OF THEM ARE HARMLESS, BUT SOME LARGE NUMBER OF THEM ARE SPIES. IN MARCH OF 2016 A CHINESE NATIONAL PLEADED GUILTY TO HELPING HACK THE COMPUTER NETWORKS OF MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTORS. DATA RELATED TO THE CFIUS STRATEGIC TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT IN THE F35 FIGHTER JET WAS STOLEN AND MADE ITS WAY BACK TO CHINA. IF THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME THE CHINESE HAVE STOLEN VITAL MILITARY SECRETS. THEIR INDUSTRIAL ESPIONAGE IS IF ANYTHING EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE. EARLIER THIS YEAR CHINESE WIND TURBINE COMPANY WAS CONVICTED OF PAYING AN ENGINEER TO STEAL SECRETS FROM AN AMERICAN MANUFACTURER. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, AFTER STEALING THE INFORMATION, THE CHINESE COMPANY THEN CANCELED $800 MILLION IN CONTRACTS. THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON. IF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ESTIMATES THE OVERALL COST FROM CHINA STAFFED AN AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INDUSTRIAL SECRETS, COULD REACH $600 BILLION EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THAT'S ALMOST AS MUCH AS ALL ANNUAL TRADE BETWEEN THIS COUNTRY AND CHINA. CHINESE BUSINESSES ARE THEMSELVES A FRONT FOR MORE CONVENTIONAL ESPIONAGE SINCE MAJOR CHINESE COMPANIES ARE BY DEFINITION CLOSELY INTERTWINED WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE CHINESE MILITARY IN MANY CASES. INTELLIGENCE EXPERTS WARNED THAT THE CHINESE MOBILE COMPANIES DTE COULD EASILY BEGIN SPYING ON ANY AMERICAN WHO OWNS THEIR PRODUCTS WHERE THEY ALLOWED TO EXPAND THEIR SHARE OF THE U.S. MARKET, AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY TRYING TO DO. THOSE ARE JUST CELL PHONES. HOW ABOUT EMAIL, AND OTHER ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS? ACCORDING TO A HIGH LEVEL GOVERNMENT SCORES ATOMIC SOURCE WHO SPOKE TO US IN THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ARTIE HAS DIRECT OR INDIRECT CONTROL MUCH OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF OUR INTERNET IN THIS COUNTRY. IF CHINA WANTS TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING THEY PROBABLY ARTIE CAN. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN EXACTLY? HOW DID WE GET TO THIS PLACE? SLOWLY AND INTENTIONALLY ON THE PART OF CHINA. OUR LEADERS MEANWHILE WERE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE CHINESE THREAT. SOME OF THEM KNEW ABOUT IT BUT DIDN'T CARE. IF THEY ARE GETTING VERY RICH FROM CHINA. NOT COINCIDENTALLY SOME OF THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE ARE THE ONES NOW TELLING YOU THAT RUSSIA IS THE BIGGEST THREAT WE FACE. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THEY ARE LYING AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE LYING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE REALLY DOING IS TRYING TO COVER THEIR TRACKS. LONGER THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER AMERICAN JOURNALIST. A SENIOR EDITOR AT "THE WASHINGTON FREE BEACON" AND THE OFFER OF I WAR, WAR AND PEACE IN THE INFORMATION AGE. THANKS FOR COMING ON GOOD TO BE HERE. Tucker: GIVE US A SENSE IF YOU CAN, I KNOW IT'S A COMPLEX TOPIC, BUT GIVE US THE SENSE OF THE SCALE OF CHINESE SPYING ON AMERICAN INDUSTRIES. IT'S A THREE-PRONGED THREAT. YOU HAVE TRADITIONAL SPYING. RIGHT NOW IN ALEXANDRIA THERE ARE TWO EX-CIA OFFICERS WHO ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION OR BEING PROSECUTED FOR SPYING RELATED ACTIVITIES IN CHINA. THEN YOU HAVE THE CYBER THREAT, AND THIS IS A MASSIVE THEFT OF TECHNOLOGY FROM BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND LAST ARE WHAT THEY CALL THE NONTRADITIONAL COLLECTORS, THAT'S THE 350,000 CHINESE STUDENTS HERE, RESEARCHERS, ACADEMICS AND THEY ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER AS MUCH A SECRET GOVERNMENT CHINESE GOVERNMENT DIRECTED PROGRAM, THEY ARE GOING AFTER THE CUTTING EDGE STUFF RIGHT NOW. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND QUANTUM COMPUTING. Tucker: SO WHO IS MINDING THE STORE? WHO WAS PROTECTING AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL SECRETS AND MILITARY DATA? IT'S THE FBI'S JOB TO GO AFTER CHINESE SPIES. JUST THIS WEEK THE HEAD OF THE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE UNIT CALLED THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CENTER SAID THAT NOT ENOUGH HAS BEEN DONE TO DEAL WITH THIS CHINESE ESPIONAGE AND TECHNOLOGY COLLECTION THREAT. HE BASICALLY UPGRADED THE THREAT. DURING THE OBAMA PERIOD WHERE THEY DIDN'T GO AFTER THIS AT ALL, NOW HE SAYS IT'S A GRAVE THREAT TO U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY AND IT'S PRIMARILY IN THIS ECONOMIC SPHERE THAT THEY ARE GOING AFTER OUR SECRETS AS WELL AS MILITARY TECHNOLOGY AS WELL. Tucker: GIVEN THAT THE CHINESE ECONOMY IS ABOUT TO SURPASS AMERICA'S INSIDES ASSUMING IT HASN'T ALREADY, THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY OUR MAIN RIVAL IN THE WORLD STAGE, WHY DIDN'T THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION FOR EIGHT YEARS RESPOND TO WHAT IS CLEARLY THE PREEMINENT THREAT WE FACE? IT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE RUSSIA PROBE. THEY KNEW ABOUT THE RUSSIA INTERFERENCE GOING BACK TO 2015 AND DID NOTHING. BASICALLY IT'S BEEN A PASSIVE APPROACH. THEY RELY ON JUST DIPLOMATIC NICETIES AND THEY BASICALLY IGNORED THIS GROWING INTELLIGENCE THREAT THAT AS YOU SAID, THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN TOTALED BETWEEN 200,000,000,600,000,000,000 ANNUALLY IN OUR MOST CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGIES. Tucker: YOU WOULD THINK THAT AMERICAN INDUSTRY FROM HOME THIS DATA IS BEING STOLEN WOULD BE COMPLAINING IN PUBLIC, BUT THEY ARE NOT. THEY ARE NOT. THERE WAS A MEETING LAST YEAR WITH A LOT OF THE TECH CHIEFS WITH TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND BASICALLY ALL OF THEM SAID YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING TO CUT OFF THIS CHINESE THEFT OF TECHNOLOGY. THEY ARE JUST PILLAGING EVERYTHING THAT SILICON VALLEY HAS AND THERE HAS BEEN LITERALLY NOTHING DONE TO TRY AND STOP THAT. Tucker: ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING. VERY QUICKLY, DO YOU THINK I'M ALMOST A RHETORICAL QUESTION, BUT THE RELENTLESS FOCUS ON RUSSIA HACKING OUR ELECTION WHATEVER THAT MEANS, DOES NOT DETRACT FROM OUR AWARENESS IN OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO CHINA? ABSOLUTELY. RUSSIA DOES POSE A THREAT BUT IT'S A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF A THREAT. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE TWO ECONOMIES. THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS SEVEN TIMES SMALLER THAN THE CHINESE ECONOMY, SO THEY ARE NOT AS GREAT A THREAT AS CHINA, SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TAKE ACTION TO STOP THE CHINESE
