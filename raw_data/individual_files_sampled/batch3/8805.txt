WITH YOU FOR THAT BREAKING NEWS. MEANWHILE, THIS IS HAPPENING. PRESIDENT TRUMP FIRING BACK AT DEMOCRATS OVER THE LATEST ACCUSATIONS AGAINST JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SAYING THEY ARE PLAYING A "CON GAME." THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE VOWED TO FIGHT THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM AHEAD OF A HEARING THIS THURSDAY. HERE'S THE PRESIDENT JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO. IT'S HORRIBLE WITH THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE, IT'S A CON GAME, THEY ARE CON ARTISTS. THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT THEMSELVES. THEY KNOW HE'S A HIGH-QUALITY PERSON, THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT. IT'S JUST RESISTANT ABSTRACT. Harris: THOSE REMARKS WERE FROM THE UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK, HE WAS SEATED NEXT TO THE PRESIDENT OF COLUMBIA AS REPORTERS WERE ASKING HIM QUESTIONS. THEY COME AFTER SARAH SANDERS SAID THE PRESIDENT IS OPEN TO HAVING KAVANAUGH'S NOW SECOND ACCUSER TESTIFY. HERE'S DEMOCRAT KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND. I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH SIDES AND I BELIEVE DR. BLASEY FORD AND I BELIEVE MR. MIRRORS. IT'S NOT THE RESPONSE OF SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO PLEAD HIS INNOCENCE, YOU HAVE WOMEN TELLING THE STORIES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AND CREDIBLY ACCUSING JUDGE KAVANAUGH OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOR, OF SEXUAL ASSAULT, OF BEHAVIOR THAT IS DISQUALIFYING. Harris: LET'S BRING IN COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT KELLYANNE CONWAY. THIS IS A HUGE NEWSMAKING DAY AHEAD OF WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THURSDAY. I WANT TO START IF WE CAN, THE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH TODAY. EVEN THOUGH HE SAID HE WAS OPEN TO HEARING A SECOND ACCUSER. THAT MAY BE A LITTLE PREMATURE BECAUSE THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE DECIDES WHO WILL TESTIFY ON THURSDAY AND I THINK WE NEED TO DEFER TO THEM. AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE COMMITTEE IS TAKING THE TESTIMONY OF DOCTOR FOR IT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. BUT IT'S WITHIN AN HOUR OF THAT ARTICLE GOING ONLINE THE OTHER NIGHT, A THINLY SOURCED, WIDELY CRITICIZED BY PEERS IN THE MEDIA ARTICLE IN THE NEW YORKER ABOUT THE SECOND ACCUSER. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DID REACH OUT TO MR. MIRRORS AND ASK IF SHE WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING. SO THEY WILL TAKE STATEMENTS, THEY WILL TAKE ANYTHING SHE WOULD LIKE TO OFFER AND THAT'S HOW THE PROCESS WORKS. THIS IS A PROCESS BEING BY THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. LET'S NOT FORGET, THIS IS NOT A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CRIMINAL PROCEEDING, IT IS STILL THE SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING OF A NOMINEE TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH. THIS WILL BE PART OF THAT. THURSDAY IS ABOUT THE TWO OF THEM, JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS MADE VERY CLEAR IN A WIDE RANGE OF INTERVIEWS, HIS WIFE BY HIS SIDE, THAT HE'S BEEN WILLING TO TESTIFY SINCE HE FOUND OUT THE NAME OF THE ACCUSER. HE WAS WILLING TO TESTIFY WHEN SHE WAS STILL ANONYMOUS BECAUSE HE IS CONFIDENT IN SAYING AS HE HAS MANY TIMES, AND ONLY HE CAN SAY THIS, THAT HE WAS AT NO SUCH PARTY, HE HAD NEVER TREATED ANYONE LIKE THIS. Harris: JUST A QUICK FOLLOW, THE PRESIDENT CALLING THIS A "CON GAME" BY DEMOCRATS, I WANT TO GET YOUR FINAL THOUGHT ON THIS. THE PRESIDENT HAS A POINT. IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PROCESS, WHY DID THE DEMOCRATS SIT ON THIS LETTER ALL THIS TIME? AFTER 30 HOURS OF SWORN TESTIMONY, HE HAS ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS AND IMPECCABLE INTEGRITY AND CHARACTER AND QUALIFICATIONS BEYOND REPROACH. MANY OF THEM WERE RAISING MONEY FOR THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS INSTEAD OF ASKING THE JUDGE ABOUT LEGAL PRECEDENT BECAUSE THEY ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT HIM. THE PRESIDENT'S POINT IS AS I SAID YESTERDAY, THIS IS BECOMING A LEFT-WING CONSPIRACY. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS, CONSULTANTS, HOLLYWOOD FOLKS AND OTHERS OF THE LEFT WING IN CAHOOTS, CODDLING EACH OTHER, DEFINITELY COACHING EACH OTHER ON THIS. THERE IS NO QUESTION. Harris: THE DEFINITION OF WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING A CON GAME. I WANT TO GET TO ROD ROSENSTEIN. THE PRESIDENT MEETING WITH HIS DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL. PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS SAYS THAT IF ROD ROSENSTEIN EXITS, HOWEVER HE EXITS, THAT COULD BEGIN THE END OF THE ROBERT MUELLER INVESTIGATION. WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING ABOUT THAT NOW? THE PRESIDENT MADE THE POINT YESTERDAY THAT ON THURSDAY HE WILL MEET WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, HE MET WITH THE CHIEF OF STAFF AT THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY PARTICIPATED IN A MEETING ON OTHER ISSUES. SOME OF THE MEDIA ARE ALWAYS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT PEOPLE COME TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND JUSTICE DOES THAT ROUTINELY. THE PRESIDENT AND MR. ROSENSTEIN WILL HAVE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS I GUESS ON THURSDAY. AS FOR THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION THAT'S UP TO THE PRESIDENT, I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT AND I THINK YESTERDAY WAS A TERRIBLE DAY FOR THE MEDIA GETTING THEIR INFORMATION FROM TWITTER, FROM FAULTY SOURCES, PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON. HE'S ON THE JOB TODAY, HE WAS ON THE JOB YESTERDAY. THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO MEET HIM IN PERSON ON THURSDAY. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, AS RUN BY THE LAST ADMINISTRATION, WAS ROTTEN TO THE CORE AT THE TOP OF THE FBI. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT CAME TO PUTTING THEIR THUMB ON THE SCALES TO GET HILLARY CLINTON ELECTED. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE I SEE A PATTERN HERE, PERHAPS. JIM COMEY FIRED FROM THE FBI HAD TAKEN NOTES, GOT A BOOK DEAL AND LEAKED SOME OF THOSE NOTES TO THE MEDIA. ANDY McCABE GOT FIRED, HAD SOME NOTES, GOT A BOOK DEAL. LEAKED NOTES TO THE MEDIA. Harris: I WANT TO BRING YOU BACK AND I HOPE YOU CAN FORGIVE THE INTERRUPTION, WE'VE GOT
