1
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:04,820
A baseball glove is basically an addition

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,109
to your hand that allows
you to trap the ball

3
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,600
between the thumb and the index finger

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,210
in such a fashion that you can

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,263
make a great catch and throw it back.

6
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:18,350
From the time I started playing baseball

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:19,630
I've been in love with the game.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,790
Something very basic about it.

9
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,260
It's not about fads or this or that,

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,150
it's about a rich heritage that goes back

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,703
you know, over a hundred years.

12
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:35,256
(dramatic music)

13
00:00:39,138 --> 00:00:40,950
(bell rings)

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,730
(tense music)

15
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,750
I'm Rob Storey.

16
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,510
I'm the Executive Vice
President of Nokona Ball Gloves.

17
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,210
We make world-class ball
gloves here in Nokona, Texas.

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,900
To build a glove you're
going to have to have

19
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,910
the right leather.

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,690
We use a number of different leathers,

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,173
such as kangaroo, cowhide,
buffalo, even some Cayman.

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,290
When that comes in to us, we
begin the grading process.

23
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,163
We're looking for any
blemishes, scars, defects.

24
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,960
With a classic walnut glove,
we're going to be using

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,240
a leather that we call Walnut Crunch.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,860
It's very durable, but
very easy to break in.

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,820
A lot of players like that
because they can go out

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,170
and play catch immediately.

29
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,610
We introduced some cutting
dies, or what we call clickers.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,140
Basically big cookie cutters.

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,700
We gotta take that leather
and cut it into about

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,223
25 different pieces.

33
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,093
We have somewhere about 2000 cutting dies.

34
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,680
While the leather's still flat,

35
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,193
do what we call hot-stamping.

36
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,830
We'll take other pieces
to the embroidery station.

37
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,090
Where we have fixed and
single-head machines

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,090
that can pump out four
to 500 gloves a day.

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,433
Putting all that information
somewhere on the leather

40
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:55,083
so that the customer is educated.

41
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,220
Once that's done, then
it's time to transition

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,870
over to the stitching department.

43
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,470
Two or three of the pieces
go a different direction

44
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,360
where they're made into the
web or the pocket of the glove.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,260
Another station will
start the interior lining.

46
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,000
This is the part that the hand touches.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,470
Not only the palm lining,
but the mac fingers,

48
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,983
as well as three center pads inside.

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,820
Start to welt those parts
together while we're

50
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,820
adding the third piece of material

51
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,960
in between the seams, setting
the spine to the backs

52
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,363
of the fingers of the glove.

53
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,780
Really at that point, you begin

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,330
to see the glove come together.

55
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,880
The fingers are finally
married to the front.

56
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,093
And it becomes a shell.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,490
Once you've closed the
glove, it's inside-out.

58
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,690
Literally pushed the leather down,

59
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:02,283
and pushed the inside back to the outside.

60
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,770
Then it's time to start shaping the glove,

61
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,470
and we do that through a series of forms

62
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,990
that look like giant hands.

63
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,560
They're heated to about
250 degrees Fahrenheit.

64
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,660
Pulled around and shaped with a mallet

65
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,900
so that all the welting and all the seams

66
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,250
are just perfectly aligned.

67
00:03:20,892 --> 00:03:24,225
(truck engine starting)

68
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,750
Living in a small town like Nokona, Texas

69
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,050
is a big part of who I am.

70
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:39,520
I think Nokona Ball Gloves

71
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,380
wouldn't necessarily work somewhere else.

72
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,653
It's about the local people and the pride.

73
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,423
The town itself is very much
a part of the final product.

74
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,880
I'm a fourth-generation
family member in the company

75
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,120
and in the 1960's, most
baseball glove manufacturers

76
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,463
decided to take their
manufacturive offshore.

77
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:05,350
My grandfather, Bob Storey,
didn't want to do that.

78
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:07,910
He wanted to give
employment to the locals.

79
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,850
He made a decision at that point that was

80
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,780
very crucial to the long-term history

81
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,890
of our company, and that was that

82
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,590
we were going to be American-made.

83
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,220
Something that's been a part of Americana

84
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,329
for decades and decades but

85
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,143
they can't find anywhere else
now in the United States.

86
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,880
There are up to 40
different labor operations

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,150
that go into making a glove.

88
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,530
And so it's not just stickin'

89
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,630
a piece of leather in a machine.

90
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,150
More and more people
are starting to realize

91
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,680
just because you can make
it cheaply somewhere else

92
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,280
that doesn't make it good.

93
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,950
You've gotta put the very best
craftsmanship into the glove.

94
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,300
We think our history of
80-plus years of doing that,

95
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,650
we've learned how to do it.

96
00:04:50,096 --> 00:04:51,030
Leather's one of the most

97
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,630
interesting materials known to man.

98
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:56,720
The feel as it firmly
wraps around your hand,

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,500
the subtle pop as the ball hits it,

100
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,250
these characteristic are things that make

101
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,700
crafting, and with this
medium, one of the most

102
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,267
enjoyable parts of my job.

103
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:10,350
(slow country music)

104
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,800
After the forming marry the outside shell

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,003
with the inside lining.

106
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,520
We're going to be gluing
some parts together.

107
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,083
So in the inside liner,

108
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,050
take long strips of
tensile-strength laces,

109
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,963
and start filling 120 holes in the glove.

110
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,410
Cosmoline holds the palm
to the inside of the liner.

111
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,960
It's a very heavy form of petroleum jelly.

112
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,580
It looks a lot like peanut butter.

113
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,090
It's a great adhesive.

114
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,030
We can open up a glove 10 years later

115
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,033
and that stuff's still sticky inside.

116
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,780
First the top fingers,

117
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,660
then the bottom perimeter of the glove.

118
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,150
And finally the web, which
usually kind of gives

119
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:00,103
the glove it's character,
into one finalize piece.

120
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:06,740
We will physically beat
the palm of the glove.

121
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,830
That softens the glove,
shapes the leather,

122
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,380
take out all the wrinkles,
and makes it just right.

123
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,640
We take hot petroleum jelly and lanolin

124
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,630
and we spray that onto the glove

125
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,030
so that we have a very
uniform layer of oil

126
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,053
that starts to moisturize the leather.

127
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,820
Just like skin, if left to its own design,

128
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,283
will start to dry out and crack and flake.

129
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,240
We bag, we tag the glove, seal it up

130
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,083
and get it ready to go out to the market.

131
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,610
(tense music)

132
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,950
Even though it's evolved
through the years,

133
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,870
it's still very very
personal to each player

134
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,357
that uses the glove.

135
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,090
I think to our customers,
Nokona Ball Gloves

136
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,990
represent a product that
is rich in heritage,

137
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,990
at the top level of the game,

138
00:07:06,990 --> 00:00:00,000
and hopefully lasts for decades to come.
