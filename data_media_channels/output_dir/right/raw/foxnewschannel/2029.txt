1
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:11,966
>> JOHN KERRY SHADOW DIPLOMACY,

2
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:13,968
HOW DOES THAT IMPACT

3
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:14,536
DELIBERATIONS?

4
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,905
>> I DON'T THINK IT IMPACTS IT

5
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:17,172
ALL.

6
00:00:17,172 --> 00:00:19,274
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE OUT ABOUT

7
00:00:19,274 --> 00:00:28,483
THAT PRETTY CLEARLY.

8
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:30,285
I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD LISTEN

9
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:33,154
TO HIM NOW.

10
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:34,989
>> THE ADMINISTRATION BLAMING

11
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:37,392
JOHN KERRY IN ENGAGING IN SHADOW

12
00:00:37,392 --> 00:00:39,294
DIPLOMACY

13
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:41,162
AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS

14
00:00:41,162 --> 00:00:44,499
HOLDING MEETINGS PRIVATELY WITH

15
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:46,968
IRANIAN OFFICIALS TRYING TO SAVE

16
00:00:46,968 --> 00:00:50,572
THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN.

17
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,540
BUT THAT DEAL CAN COME TO A

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,576
HAULT TOMORROW.

19
00:00:54,576 --> 00:00:55,577
WE KNOW NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT

20
00:00:55,577 --> 00:00:57,178
WILL MAKE HIS FEELINGS KNOWN.

21
00:00:57,178 --> 00:01:02,484
HIS DECISION KNOWN ON THIS.

22
00:01:02,484 --> 00:01:04,285
NOW THE COUNT DOWN IS ON.

23
00:01:04,285 --> 00:01:07,789
WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WORLD

24
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:13,261
LEADERS BUY INTO THIS.

25
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:13,928
>> GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

26
00:01:13,928 --> 00:01:15,296
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION

27
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:19,601
OF LOGAN ACT, IT ESSENTIALLY

28
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:20,902
SAYS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT

29
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:23,338
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAL

30
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:23,371
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAA

31
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:23,438
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAY

32
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:23,471
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAK

33
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:23,505
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAN

34
00:01:23,505 --> 00:01:23,538
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEA

35
00:01:23,538 --> 00:01:23,571
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAF

36
00:01:23,571 --> 00:01:23,605
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAD

37
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:23,638
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAA

38
00:01:23,638 --> 00:01:23,671
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEA

39
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,923
ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAR

40
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:28,042
NEGOTIATION WITH ANY FOREIGN

41
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:28,643
LEADER.

42
00:01:28,643 --> 00:01:29,310
IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR EVEN

43
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,412
THOUGH IT'S NEVER USED.

44
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:31,946
>> IT'S NEVER USED.

45
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:32,297
IF YOU TALK

46
00:01:34,449 --> 00:01:35,016
TO MOST CONSERVATIVE

47
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:35,783
LEGAL SCHOLARS THEY WILL TELL

48
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:37,152
YOU IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

49
00:01:37,152 --> 00:01:38,853
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WHAT

50
00:01:38,853 --> 00:01:39,554
JOHN KERRY DID WAS ILLEGAL BUT

51
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:41,856
IT IS CERTAINLY OUTRAGEOUS AND

52
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:43,258
IT IS CERTAINLY HYPOCRITICAL.

53
00:01:43,258 --> 00:01:45,460
IF YOU RECALL IN 2015 WHEN

54
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,061
JOHN KERRY WAS NEGOTIATING THIS

55
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:48,229
HORRIBLE IRAN DEAL, TOM COTTON

56
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:50,298
AND 46 REPUBLICAN SENATORS WROTE

57
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:53,301
A LETTER TO IRAN'S LEADERS WHERE

58
00:01:53,301 --> 00:01:56,037
THEY SIMPLY BLAMED THE SENATE'S

59
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:57,438
ROLE IN THE APPROVAL OF

60
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,040
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,441
JOHN KERRY WAS OUTRAGED.

62
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:01,176
HE EXPRESSED HIS UTTER DISBELIEF

63
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:03,444
AT THEIR IRRESPONSIBLE ACTIONS.

64
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:03,945
THIS IS A QUOTE.

65
00:02:03,945 --> 00:02:06,447
TO WRITE THE LEADERS IN THE

66
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:08,449
MIDDLE OF A NEGOTIATION IS QUITE

67
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,184
STUNNING AND IGNORES MORE THAN

68
00:02:09,184 --> 00:02:10,285
TWO CENTURIES OF PRECEDENT IN

69
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:12,187
THE CONDUCT OF AMERICAN FOREIGN

70
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:13,288
POLICY.

71
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,022
TOM COTTON WAS AND IS A SITTING

72
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,791
UNITED STATES SENATOR.

73
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,126
THE SENATOR HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL

74
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,328
ROLE IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY.

75
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,362
JOHN KERRY HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL

76
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:21,863
ROLE IN NOTHING.

77
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:28,303
HE'S A FORMER OFFICIAL.

78
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:29,003
>> Martha: I THINK YOU POINTED

79
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:32,974
OUT IN SOME THOUGHTS HE POINTED

80
00:02:32,974 --> 00:02:33,241
OUT.

81
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,442
IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF YOU ARE

82
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:35,877
TRYING TO RALLY WITH SOME OF OUR

83
00:02:35,877 --> 00:02:36,544
ALLIES AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO

84
00:02:36,544 --> 00:02:39,480
STAND FIRM AGAINST ANY ATTEMPT

85
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,449
TO SHATTER THE DEAL, BUT INSTEAD

86
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,051
HE'S RALLYING WITH THE ENEMY.

87
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:44,686
>> HE'S WORKING WITH -- HE'S

88
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:48,489
WORKING WITH -- COLLABORATING

89
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:50,258
WITH A TERRORIST STATE, A

90
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:51,659
READING THAT HAS RALLIED MORE

91
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,127
PEOPLE CHANT DEATH TO AMERICA IN

92
00:02:53,127 --> 00:02:54,796
ORDER TO UNDERMINE THE FOREIGN

93
00:02:54,796 --> 00:02:56,631
POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES OF

94
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:57,498
AMERICA.

95
00:02:57,498 --> 00:03:00,101
THAT COULD BE COLLUSION WITH A

96
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:03,271
FOREIGN POWER.

97
00:03:03,271 --> 00:03:03,938
TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY.

98
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:06,174
I THOUGHT WE WERE AGAINST

99
00:03:06,174 --> 00:03:07,041
COLLUSION.

100
00:03:07,041 --> 00:03:08,309
>> Martha: WANTED TO CHARGE

101
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:09,611
MIKE FLYNN WITH THE LOGAN ACT IN

102
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:12,280
VIOLATION OF THE LOGAN ACT.

103
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,048
OUTRAGED THAT HE WAS DISCUSSING

104
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,916
THINGS AS A TRANSITION OFFICIAL

105
00:03:14,916 --> 00:03:17,485
WITH A FOREIGN AMBASSADOR.

106
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:18,052
HE WAS ON THE WAY INTO

107
00:03:18,052 --> 00:03:21,055
GOVERNMENT AT THAT POINT.

108
00:03:21,055 --> 00:03:23,224
YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOTH

109
00:03:23,224 --> 00:03:24,692
THINGS AS APPLES AND APPLES.

110
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,194
IF HE WAS OUTRAGED ABOUT THAT,

111
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:26,794
SHE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE

112
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:30,498
OUTRAGED ABOUT THIS.

113
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:31,499
>> ABSOLUTELY.

114
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:32,233
JOHN KERRY HAS TRANSITIONED OUT

115
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:34,102
OF GOVERNMENT, HE'S A PRIVATE

116
00:03:34,102 --> 00:03:34,435
CITIZEN.

117
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:35,570
HIS DEFENDERS, WHAT THEY WOULD

118
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:36,537
SAY IS ALL FORMER SECRETARIES OF

119
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:39,073
STATE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR

120
00:03:39,073 --> 00:03:40,074
COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD AND

121
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:40,708
CAN WREAK DEL MIKE HENRY

122
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,876
KISSINGER DID THIS.

123
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:43,278
HE WAS A GLOBE-TROTTING DIPLOMAT

124
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:44,245
FOR YEARS AFTER LEAVING

125
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:45,079
GOVERNMENT.

126
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,047
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

127
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:47,148
HENRY KISSINGER, ESPECIALLY WITH

128
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:49,150
A SENSITIVE MOMENT LIKE THIS, HE

129
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,585
WOULD ASK THE PERMISSION OF THE

130
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:51,286
WHITE HOUSE WHETHER IT WAS A

131
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,987
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT

132
00:03:52,987 --> 00:03:53,354
PRESIDENT.

133
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:55,390
HE WOULD CARRY A MESSAGE FROM

134
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,658
THE PRESIDENT.

135
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:57,191
>> Martha: EXACTLY.

136
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:59,193
HOW ABOUT A REQUEST, DO YOU MIND

137
00:03:59,193 --> 00:04:00,728
IF I REACH OUT AND HAVE A

138
00:04:00,728 --> 00:04:01,262
CONVERSATION OR NOT?

139
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:01,729
LET ME KNOW.

140
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:03,831
I DON'T WANT TO BE UNHELPFUL

141
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,466
HERE.

142
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:07,435
BEN RHODES, OBVIOUSLY VERY

143
00:04:07,435 --> 00:04:08,102
INVOLVED AS A MEMBER OF THE

144
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:10,371
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH THE

145
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:12,473
WHOLE IRAN DEAL AS WELL,

146
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:15,977
OUTRAGED BECAUSE HE HAS THE

147
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:18,446
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS AN

148
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:19,447
ISRAELI-U.S. ATTEMPT TO DIG UP

149
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:21,616
DIRT ON THE PEOPLE WHO DEVELOPED

150
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:25,219
THIS DEAL IN ORDER TO DISCREDIT

151
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:25,887
THEM AS A SORT OF DOSSIER

152
00:04:25,887 --> 00:04:28,056
AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT

153
00:04:28,056 --> 00:04:28,823
THIS DEAL.

154
00:04:28,823 --> 00:04:30,258
HE SAYS THIS IS NOT BEHAVIOR

155
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:32,360
THAT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IN A

156
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,094
DEMOCRACY.

157
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:35,697
IT'S A THUGGISH, MEAN-SPIRITED,

158
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:37,398
CHILLING AND THREATENING CLOUD

159
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:38,333
OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT RISKS

160
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:42,270
EXTENDING FAR BEYOND ME, AND

161
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,004
COLLIN, WHO WAS ALSO NAMED IN

162
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:43,304
THEM.

163
00:04:43,304 --> 00:04:45,640
WHAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT >> DO

164
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,841
KNOW IT'S UNACCEPTABLE IN OUR

165
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,208
DEMOCRACY?

166
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,243
BEN RHODES.

167
00:04:49,243 --> 00:04:50,578
IT THE LEAST QUALIFIED PERSON TO

168
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:53,247
EVER SIT IN A POSITION OF

169
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:53,915
AUTHORITY IN FOREIGN POLICY.

170
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:55,450
I DOUBT THAT THE STORY IS TRUE.

171
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:56,718
I DOUBT THAT DONALD TRUMP'S

172
00:04:56,718 --> 00:04:59,020
WHITE HOUSE WAS DOING THIS, THEY

173
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,921
SAY THE TRUMP TEAM MAY HAVE BEEN

174
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:02,423
INVOLVED IN THIS.

175
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,258
THAT COULD BE ANYBODY.

176
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:05,159
I THINK MIKE POMPEO AND JOHN

177
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:07,862
BOLTON HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO

178
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:08,663
LEANING UP BEN RHODES' MASSES

179
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:11,866
AND TO DIG UP DIRT.

180
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:12,533
>> Martha: WORTH REMEMBERING

181
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:14,302
THAT BEN ROSE BRAG ABOUT THE

182
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:15,703
ECHO CHAMBER AND THE YOUNG

183
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:17,138
JOURNALISTS IN THEIR 20s WHO

184
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,072
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

185
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:19,173
FOREIGN POLICY THAT HE WAS ABLE

186
00:05:19,173 --> 00:00:00,000
TO CREATE THIS ECHO CHAMBER TO
