guesting it could mean so many things
yeah I like that one I was gonna say it
sounded pretty 90s and then it's
centered really 70s because he's always
been really into that kind of retro
nostalgic I was getting a heavy heavy
like seal yeah nineties life
I like the chorus hola if i was high on
ecstasy I'd probably really enjoy it
the stones are great though the program
is great the shape of the arc whatever
dr. Torres owns like an upside down drop
it like it's hot to me is about the last
thing I expected any of you guys to
savor this okay okay I still want to
give you the shoulder like looking big
side this thing that was immediately
identifiable which is a Spence in this
day and age when it's hard to stand
there people really love to party and
listen to that band margin being the
bass player in that I'm not bigoted
laughing Gouda is so much fun as
evidenced by our trap clear basic
it reminds me of a kind of an electro
Siouxsie and the Banshees a little bit
the sequence is really odd as well yeah
the catch you see it's really unperfect
yeah it's like Russian America
the Goths like dress like executives now
executive Goths with nice trousers but
like really too short for you and some
statement socks and I've got Paul shot
on know that I'm worthy yeah your cost
of just evolved they've all got short
haircuts their like tight haircuts not
like like Robert semester and like
anymore that's all fun
kind of a shame I miss that either my
favorite go
you
