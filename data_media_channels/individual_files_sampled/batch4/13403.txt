so I was watching James Comey and I you know it was obvious the FBI director of the Trump fired and he basically claims that you know this was a form of obstruction of justice he released his memos to the press he leaked them to the press through a friend at Columbia University and that is what started the Special Counsel investigation which according to Comey under in his testimony he said that's why he did it he did it to get Trump investigated so a very very adept political operator but when I was looking at thinking that I was thinking about Richard Nixon because everybody always says this scandal is worse than Watergate but to me you know you look back in Watergate Watergate was really was a kind of a bunch of minor crimes and misdemeanors nothing nothing at all like the IRS scandal under the Obama administration the only difference being the press didn't cover the IRS scandal I mean to take the most powerful agency in the country and silence your political opponents with it during an election year I mean that is a major major American scandal but they just ignored it so it didn't matter but they got Nixon there was a higher level of honor there was before we discovered that the bar of honor only applied to Republicans not to Democrats once we discovered that it all kind of became a little bit adjustable but mixing stepped down because he didn't want the country to descend into a constitutional crisis and impeachment hearings and so on Nixon said this in his final speech as he was leaving the office as he was leaving office and mixing that in those days was just a utter figure of disdain hatred everybody hated him the press had ginned up all this hatred against them but he wasn't interested dark figure but an interesting figure and he made this final comment which I has always stuck in my mind always remember others may hate you but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them and then you destroy yourself and he was referring to himself I mean it was a very self-aware thought that he was saying he had come to hate the people who were attacking him and that was why he was destroyed because and as they frequently said with Watergate the cover-up was worse than the crime and it was the fact that Nixon couldn't concede to his enemies that he had made mistakes that he had done a couple of bad things that had all kind of got out of hand and was all this you know all these cover-ups all this illegal action to keep the news out of the press and he just appeared to the people as a liar and I got kind of a cry as he himself said as a crook I worry during the primaries that we were doing this with Donald Trump that Barack Obama had gotten us so ticked off and the press had gotten us so ticked off that we were essentially had come to hate them and we're throwing Donald Trump at them like a bowling ball you know like the attitude basically being we gave you george w bush one of the most decent men you know who ever was president and you called him Hitler we ran Mitt Romney one of the most decent men in the country and you told us oh he bullied someone in high school he put put his dog on the roof and he made maybe he was responsible for a death that happened when a company closed I mean he just made him out to be a criminal and eventually we just thought okay if those are the rules if Barack Obama can abuse the IRS if he can lie and lie and lie if he can do all the thing and he can say he's gonna fundamentally transform this country that we love that we don't want fundamentally transformed if that's okay and Mitt Romney is the bad guy here's Donald Trump eat this you know and I was afraid that this was going to destroy the conservative movement and there's still that concern there's still the concern that basically he's going to alienate so many young people from republicanism from conservatism that will never get them back however however the one thing about Trump is the Trump equals Obama in the talent of making his enemies ticked off and I have noticed again and again I've spoken about this many times on the show that the people who come after him destroy themselves Marco Rubio with the fingers you know talking about the fingers one after another the people who come after him I mean can anybody deny that Donald Trump has undermined the credibility of the press not by his tweets not by the shouting and the screaming in the yelling but by what they've done to him I mean a year and a half of russia' investigation with nothing to show for it you know who would trust these people again so I was thinking about this as I watched James Comey on TV they've been building up and building up his book that he's putting out and it's this book about how virtuous he is but really there's not that much news in it I mean even Maggie Haberman a Clinton loyalist at the time said this there's not that much news in it it's it's like he says he has the story of Trump asking for his loyalty which Trump says is untrue but he's told that story before he compares him to a mob boss I mean this is just it's just vitriol you know I mean I you know listen we have a quote just a little bit of this George Stephanopoulos who was interviewing him asked him about comparing them to a mob boss and listen to what Comey says how strange is it for you to sit here and compare the president to a mob boss very strange and I don't do it lightly and I'm not trying to by that by the way suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and shaking down shopkeepers but instead what I'm talking about is that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration so I'm not doing it lightly but it doesn't mean when I say he's a mob boss it doesn't mean he's a mob boss I mean my bosses kill people they grow up Rob things they you know ask for they ask for you know protection money and things like no he's not meaning any of that he just means that he demands loyalty to himself and the and he says it's all about the family the family the family so when you start there you just think like it's just it's just pure vitriol it's just I was fired and I hate this guy and you know he again not a lot of news he talks about the Russian collusion story he says well it might have happened it might you know these things might have happened maybe the Russians had something to blackmail him with but I could say that about anybody or maybe the Russians have something to blackmail Comey with you know a guy like this who's so political when he walked into Donald Trump and he said I just want you to know that there's this story about you with Russian prostitutes Trump may have trim probably wasn't savvy enough at the time to think about it this way but Trump may have felt like oh Mike this is like J Edgar Hoover coming in to me and saying don't step out of line cuz I've got information on you I mean the guy was obviously playing the game for himself so here was the big quote as far as I was concerned where he asked Stephanopoulos ask Comey if Trump was unfit for office and this is commis response and I don't think he's medically unfit to be President I think morally unfit to be President the person who sees moral equivalence in Strongsville who talks about and treats women like they're pieces of meat who lies constantly about matters big and small and insist the American people believe it that person is not fit to be President of the United States on moral grounds our president must embody respect and adhere to the values there at the core of this country the most important being truth this president is not able to do that he's morally unfit to be President I'm sitting there thinking about this okay I think okay treats women like me I would say that that's sounds pretty true some of the things he's crude things he said some of the abuses he is you know some of the affairs he's had with women or at least they allege he's had with women but also true of Bill Clinton right I mean that was something that was true of Bill Clinton with the girl you know young enough to be his daughter on her knees in the Oval Office with all the girls here were the one woman he was accused of raping all the girls he was accused of grabbing treated women like me then he says he lies constantly about matters big and small and I thought like yeah like if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor we waited until there were moderates in Iran before we started negotiating with him that was a lie bill a iers I'm a I'm talking obviously about the lies from Obama bill eyes was just a guy in the neighborhood not a terrorist who helped me start my political career I never heard Jeremiah Wright say nasty things about America after 20 years in the pew you know I mean these are these are things that can be held against people and I'm not saying the Trump is a good guy I'm not saying that he doesn't have a case against him I'm just saying when it's all on one side it makes you just look like a political operative and you know in terms of Charlottesville which I think Trump gets hit on this again and again and again when you go back and look at the transcripts Trump was in Charlotte was talking about people who wanted statues torn down versus people who didn't want statues torn down he said you had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of to them a very very important statue and the renaming of a park from robert e lee to another name and when he said that there were good people on both sides those were the people he was talking about it's very clear and it's us if you it was a tone deaf yes was it not the right way to put it at the yes but but that's what he was saying and I just think that the politicizing of this from James Comey is just purely manipulative and political and we know he's a political guy from the fact that he leaked information in order to get in order to get a special counsel to investigate the guy who had fired him we know that that's the truth you know I mean this is it's really as interesting the the Inspector General report on Andrew McCabe came out I had the the other fired FBI guy and remember the press was weeping and moaning that he wasn't gonna get his full pension and all this and and it says the IG report says we concluded that McCabe lacked candor on four separate occasions in connection with the disclosure to the Wall Street Journal three of those occasions involved his testimony under oath so he lied under oath but no one has talked about bringing criminal charges against him no one has talked about that he lied under oath but no one is talking about perjury the AP reports this and I'm getting this from News Buster's the AP reports this the news department the Justice Department watchdog says fired FBI director Andrew McCabe mislead investigators over his role in the news media disclosure and it they talk about the lack of candor but they do not put together the fact that he was lying under oath and so all I'm saying is I admit that James Comey putting out a book as news you want to hear the vitriol but that's all it is it all it is is vitriol and let's not forget let us not forget that when James Comey reopened the Clinton investigation during the election remember at the last minute he said I found some new emails on Anthony Weiner's computer and I have to look into this the press went nuts I mean the press just hated them this is cut number 10 James Comey is getting horrible advice he is interfering in this election I don't understand what the guy is doing but just from pure political point of view it's a nightmare for the Clinton ministration a Clinton campaign I know why they're upset they should be I think what Jim Comey did was to throw overboard Justice Department procedures because of political reasons his own internal politics because of the hatred for Hillary Clinton within the f this is just the worst possible situation for the FBI for the country for Hillary Clinton certainly what why throw that stink bomb in the middle of this you know at the very end of the campaign I think that's that's a real big problem it does seem like we have a problem with the FBI director Comey has said high profile investigations make him feel pressure to do things quickly and do it well tonight as critics are wondering if he is failed on both counts what we're talking about here is we're talking about being reactionary we're talking about having a knee-jerk reaction to everything that happens according to what side you're on and this is what I was talking about during the primaries with Trump are we being reactionary are we gaining this guy who is a great big animal who's gonna tear things down because we're so angry at Barack Obama and were so angry at the press the press I mean the press does it to you there's no question about it the press makes me angry with their constant lies our constant one-sidedness but it's just you know when you are watching partisan politics this is what's happening you should know all the time that that's what you're watching and when the press is as we now see they are Democrat operatives with press cards as Glenn Reynolds calls them overt instant pundit when we see their Democrat operatives with press cards we just remember they are reacting all the time and Trump has this kind of magical power to make them overreact I mean even the Democrats the Democrats remember at this moment he did James Comey you know the RNC has put up a sign called lion copy it's a site called lion Comey and so they put together this montage of Democrats hating on Comey that's where the the danger music comes from in the background but the montage was perfectly fair Democrats been very critical of James Comey and many of us did his resignation well I was appalled by what director called me did call me acted in an outrageous way he made a mistake maybe he's not in the right job powerdine former Democratic candidate for president says quote he may have destroyed the credibility of the FBI forever this was a very serious error in judgment the president what the fire called me immediately and the auto initiate an investigation what he did was unprecedented and outrageous damaged the institution of law enforcement in this country the lowest moment in the history of the FBI I found it hard to believe that Comey who I thought had some degree of integrity would do this all I can tell you is the FBI director has no credibility so what you're hearing is you're hanging Democrats say that stuff the press gives them the echo chamber and then Comey comes out in a tax trumpets ha Comey look love that Comey Comey is you know really I mean you can just see here's let's play cut number four there's a CNN panel just listen to the difference in tone suddenly now the Comey is attacking Trump we've been waiting for this interview to happen finally speaking out this is the man who used to be the head of the FBI one of the highest offices in the government calling the President of the United States morally unfit your reaction look I mean this is something that in any other time would be seismic and I think even in this time where it's easy to kind of lose sight of of things that are enormous enormous ly out of bounds and enormous ly unusual for an FBI director even though he was fired and he has you know he certainly feels a sense he says of higher loyalty but some retribution let's face it to say the things that he did about a sitting president of the United States is absolutely extraordinary it is extraordinary but it is extraordinary vengefulness pettiness a ego or is it an extraordinary revelation I mean this is the the whole thing about Trump he's like what has he done if Mitt Romney is a criminal because he ties his dog in a in a crate to the top of his car when he's traveling on a trip if that makes MIT Romney one of the most decent people country a criminal we don't they have to cite something that Donald Trump is done don't they have to say when you say he's morally unfit to be President and all you can cite are things that other presidents have done before him but they just happened to be Democrats you know there was like a lot here when you caught lying while being a Democrat then it's not as bad don't you have to say like well come on you got to produce the goods you got to produce the goods and Comey kind of says that at one point which to me turned the entire interview the entire event on its head Comey says we shouldn't impeach Trump this would cut to give you a strange answer I hope not because I think impeaching and removing Donald Trump from office would let the American people off the hook and have something happen indirectly that I believe their duties bound to do directly people in this country need to stand up and go to the voting booth and vote their values and so impeachment in a way which short-circuit that so James Comey is going to explain to us this FBI guy who that got fired for leaking stuff he's gonna explain to us what our moral duty is I mean where do these guys get the gall you know where do they get the gall where do they think their position comes from so now you know everything the Trump does is wrong and even you know he he sent a a retaliatory strike against Syria for over the weekend almost immediately the minute the clayvin last weekend began you know they launched missiles late I think it's Syria they don't know it cleverness we got oh my god and and you know the story is the sourced story that was in The Wall Street Journal is that Trump wanted to go much harder he really wanted to dislodge make some political hits and maybe even dislodge Assad and may strike on his compound but James Madison and said the ramifications with the Russians and the Iranians would just be too much to handle and we'd end up having to go in we don't want to do that let's keep it you know steady and just bomb one of their chemical factories which they did oddly enough nobody sounds like like one person was killed I mean don't they it was nobody guarding the chemical factory did they call them up I hadn't say they're missiles coming your way so and then he gets it from both sides because he put out a tweet that said mission accomplished and they start saying oh my god that's what George W Bush said and the mission wasn't accomplished but this mission was accomplished you know I mean I listened to this mission accomplished this is a montage this is they just seize on this one thing he the tweet says a perfectly executed strike last night thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military the France and the United Kingdom joined in could not have had a better result mission accomplished right makes perfect sense here's the press discussing it Trump said the strike was perfectly executed and that the mission was accomplished but some in Congress say the strikes didn't go far enough Kristin this morning we've already heard from the president doubling down on his mission accomplished line with Syria and know the tak they believe the tactical mission was a success but they do we know what the strategy is on Syria going for a mission accomplishes a short-term declaration and when you tweet about it this is not the substitute for either a message or a strategy mission accomplished those are loaded words in American politics and dangerous to use when no one believes one night of military strikes will dislodge the Assad regime or bring order to one of the world's most cruel and deadly places well George I think it is generally not wise to use the term mission accomplished in an ongoing conflict but if you want it if what you wanted was a limited punishing strike is safe for US and Allied forces as you can possibly make it with no unintended casualties on the ground and no escalation in the conflict than the mission was accomplished so though it's like the commentary is the mission was accomplished but was the mission accomplished because it was accomplished but he's accomplishing the mission actually mission accomplished or is accomplishing a mission not an accomplished mission in which case it's not a mission you know and the thing and the entire here's the thing about narrative the way into this narrative works the whole thing with george w bush standing on that troop ship where they had put up the sign mission accomplished and he was just making a speech and so the cat the camera caught that with the sign behind them that that itself was created by the press right if that had been obama do you think they would have made a big deal over the mission accomplished i no of course not of course not they say those are loaded words in american politics who loaded them who loaded them they did so it's all their narrative playing back in this endless loop it's in this endless loop not to say however that Trump didn't get some some flak from the right for this this whole kind of isolationist body on the right you know why is he building the wall why is he going into Syria you know these things have to be dealt with you can't just sit by while they use chemical weapons you can't sit by and let people be destroyed you know without at least making a comment which is essentially what's sending a couple of rockets over there is you know to to say you know we're not gonna stand for it this is a beyond global norms you can't do that so there does have to be but a lot of people were upset about this on the right no one more upset than our friend Alex Jones at Infowars listen to this and then they say there they're like you know if you just turn against Trump things will be better but he was doing good and that was makes it so bad if you can't see that it's just listening the guy sitting next to him oh and I guess his name is has this look on his face like he just sat like he's on a subway and there's nowhere to move and I lunatic next dude his eyes are about the size of saucers he's going what is happening to thanks alex is Jones is weeping for Syria weep for Syria Alex but but here's the thing here's the thing and I'll finish with this and then we'll talk to knowles you know they had this raid on trump's lawyer right Trump's personal lawyer they had a raid and what it seems that they're investigating is that this lawyer Michael Kohn made some payoffs to women who were threatening to talk about their affairs with Donald Trump during the election and they seemed to believe that Cohn got the money to make these payoffs he got the money to make these payoffs by applying for a house loan to the bank and then using the money for that and that's bank fraud okay so that that's what they're talking about right now that's everything I know from reading the newspapers basically that they have so you're talking about the President of the United States you're talking about the last president used the IRS to silence his political opponents you're talking about presidents who have done things you know in terms of when Clinton was in office in terms of China that bordered on the very suspicious you know very suspicious stuff that he did that money he took from Russia while Hillary Clinton was doing favors for the Russians yeah all this stuff that doesn't count it doesn't count but they're going to go after Donald Trump for some payoffs to some women which is probably pretty common in politics to begin with we're how do we trust them how do we trust on it so there's this ping-pong ball going back and forth of this ping-pong ball of a reactionary hatred between the left and the right and I don't see how it doesn't just keep getting worse and worse and worse until somebody says until somebody by accident almost gets elected who actually has honor and decency and can start to talk to people the way people should be spoken to you know I mean I'm not I'm not defending Donald Trump here you know I'm not defending his attitude you know he had all these tweets against Comey where he called him a slimeball and he kind of you know stoop to his level slippery James Comey a man who always ends up badly and out of whack he is not smart he will go down as the worst FBI director in history Comey Dre you know he says he's guilty of many crimes which I thought doesn't seem to be true to me I'm not sure what Comey did that was criminal you know it is it is this kind of dialogue where when when only one side is expected to be civil namely the right ultimately that's just not gonna work and so we have this reactionary ping-pong game going back and forth so if the left doesn't like Donald Trump you know I mean my attitude toward Donald Trump is his lifestyle has been egregious he cheats on his wife almost surely you know he's here the way he talks as egregious he has a bullying style but his governance is fine right his governance has been fine he's been governing like a kind of typical Republican to the right a little bit more conservative than to the typical Republican hasn't done anything authoritarian hasn't stretched the norms of constitutional governance so as far as I'm concerned the not inviting him to my house but you know he's been a good president he has been a bit good president if the rules are as according to James Comey that he has to have honored that he has to always speak truthfully that he can't treat women badly then those rules have to apply both ways okay then the lies of Barack Obama have to come home to roost and the treatment that Bill Clinton dealt out to women have to come home to roost and Hillary Clinton's fronting for Bill Clinton has to come home to roost until that moment comes you know this is just going to be a ping-pong game of getting of lower lower degradation as we react to each other III just think like the press it's all about the press it's all about the press because if the politicians were doing what they do which is defending their partisan position and the press weren't only playing for one side it would be a much much different scenario so anyway I think we should go back to Nixon and remember the people who hate you can't destroy you unless you hate them and then you destroy themselves and that seems to me to be going on a little bit on both sides but maybe right now just a little bit more on the left all right I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube come on over to the Daily wire calm listen to the rest of the show I think you can listen on YouTube too but but if you subscribe for a lousy 10 bucks a month you could watch the whole show right on the daily wire calm it subscribe for a lousy hundred bucks you get the whole year plus the leftist tears tumblr and you know it is magic it is a magic tumblr because it fills up automatically with leftist years whenever I speak and then you drink them and it cures your eczema all right Michael Noel's speaking of eczema Michael Moss is coming up right now there is no there you are I can't hear you can you hear me now I got it like a you've got me thinking the eczema comment was no joke I was out at the beach over this weekend yeah and of Chi have bronze Sicilian skin so I don't usually lather up the Sun sunscreen right and I am just a blister you really were out there I make a human blister right now so fortunately for the entire audience see nobody can see that right in fact just just imagining it is worse than you know it's why I have this - I've miner a desert people and so I go out and I think I don't need sunscreen but now now I just got a spray I hate that gum oh yeah so I just spray myself every time I go out and they see a halo disgusting stuff like uh we're gonna let's talk about scooter libby remind people who scooter libby is and how he got in trouble in the first place well it all goes back to james comey because james cut in 2003 james comey was the adeptia tourney general and this was the first time he really screwed something up there was the Valerie Plame scandal and he appoints a special counsel to invest a blah blah blah blah blah and screw Libby was Dick Cheney's chief of staff chief of staff to the vice president the United States there was something called the Valerie Plame affair it basically only existed in the mainstream media in the imagination and fever dreams of the mainstream media it existed to attack george w bush because george w bush was right think about something it's because he was right and because he didn't have actual scandals so they had to jin this one out yeah yeah it basically all happened because Valerie Plame was a covert CIA operative she was married to Joseph Wilson who was a former diplomat and so Wilson went on a fact-finding mission to investigate whether Saddam Hussein was trying to get uranium from Niger he comes back and writes an op-ed in the New York Times and said absolutely not he wasn't doing that and one of these reasons for the Iraq war just wasn't true turns out that Al Bhed was not true he's I'm Hussein absolutely was trying to get uranium from Niger this was widely accepted by the international intelligence agencies and the u.s. intelligence agencies we know the only other explanation for a 1999 high-level Iraqi trip to Niger would be that they were I don't know just on vacation or something Niger doesn't export anything by anyone who has even looked into this for eight minutes that is now accepted now they didn't yeah just just to just to break in here I have to remember because people don't remember they're too young to remember that the press he did george w bush you know they they say oh it's all about trump it's all about trump know trump is different trump is different well maybe trump is different but they hated him and the idea that the New York Times had run an op ed and had got him and then got wrong-footed drove them insane so we just have to put that in context this is not new with the press they hate Republicans no matter who they are I know it's confusing because now they love george w bush they always love the last republic Republic they always really love him but if the the anti-bush hysteria was just as bad as the anti-trump hysteria in most ways people forget about that now so they thought they had him they were so excited that they had him and they were wrong they were just dead wrong about it so at a certain point the identity the covert CIA identity of Wilson's wife Valerie Plame is leaked it was a columnist basically saying you know he just mentioned it as he was proving that George W Bush was right that's right he mentioned Valerie Plame's in Novak writing in The Washington Post referenced this her position with the CIA and this became a big scandal now this is where Comey comes in Comey as Deputy Attorney General appoints a special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald to investigate all of these nefarious dealings because the Democrats were hoping that the White House a leak did as retribution for Wilson's op Edie right there are a lot of moving parts here yeah but if you look even slightly beyond the surface and none of that holds up the White House didn't have to get back at Wilson for anything Wilson got it wrong the truth the truth validated quite so so there's an investigation into all of this Scooter Libby who was the only guy who was who was sentenced to prison and fined for this whole thing was never even indicted he was never indicted for it because it was absurd to think that he leaked it he did not leak if we know that he did not we actually know who did leak Valerie Plame's information and it was a Deputy Secretary of State richard armitage so he had nothing to do with Cheney right and that was the big one they didn't have anything to do with the White House State Department right and so richard armitage who by the way opposed the arrest right proposed the Arachnia Posey wreck where he had no reason to to get revenge on Wilson or on Valerie Plame it just came out as these things do people don't know what's cove or what isn't covert so we know that richard armitage leaked it he never went to jail he was never sentenced to anything they get Scooter Libby because they wanted to get the White House they got him on a procedural crime of making conflicting statements to investigators and this that and the other thing he had absolutely nothing to do with claim he gets sentenced to a quarter-million dollar fine and two and a half years in jail so very similar to what happened to Mike Flynn in this Russian and collusion investigation no Russian collusion they haven't found a thing but they got a couple of guys who made conflicting statements when they say to you you lied to the FBI you've got to decide whether you're gonna face a long time in prison or you're gonna plead and get a deal yeah I mean that's what you have to do that's exactly right and they're gonna squeeze him and look you can indict a ham sandwich and they they basically said look we're gonna get you we're gonna get you for something so I we thought we were gonna get you on this obviously that didn't happen at all and actually we already knew from Richard Armitage that he was the guy who leaked it but you're going to jail buddy so George W Bush at the time despite Dick Cheney begging him to pardon scooter libby as he should have done george bush said no well he did do this little procedural crime and so i'll commute his sentence but i won't pardon him right donald trump just pardon scooter libby justice prevailing eleven years late and i got to tell you something i like george w bush i think in many ways he was a good leader and a moral guy this was a moral miscalculation on the part of george w bush and crazy as it sounds this was an absolutely correct moral judgment made by donald trump justice finally prevails eleven years later eleven years too late well it's like it is kind of like an esop fable of why Trump is in the White House in a way because the fact that george w bush was so in love with maintaining the honor of the office and remember bill clinton had dragged the office of the presidency through the muck i mean people used to think conservatives used to talk about how ronald reagan wouldn't remove his jacket and tie when he was in the oval office cuz that's how much he respected it where bill clinton was removing his pants in the oval office building human humidors there were a lot of and so you know george w bush for conservatives came in with a mandate to restore the dignity of the office but in doing this and not in not pardoning scooter libby for this completely created scandal a scandal that actually didn't exist because Valerie Plame was not like out there in the field you know like the girl on Homeland you know arresting terrorists she was already basically back home she was not it was not endangering anybody so for this completely meaningless leak they developed the scandal simply to silence the fact that George W Bush was right he was right and that and so it really is it shows you why conservatives are fed up now they actually made a movie about this I'm I've only seen bits and pieces of what was it called fair game rights this movie with Naomi Watts and Sean Penn that's just Sean Penn that should tell you all but suddenly suddenly she was like you know no he was a beautiful and talented actress and suddenly that's Valerie Plame and she's a big spy basically right and basically everything in the movie is untrue and the movie also covers up the fact that George Bush was right that the intelligence was right and it gets a little confusing because there was some disinformation from about Niger to try to discredit this trip to try to discredit Saddam Hussein from his Nam Hussein trying to get uranium from Niger there were forged documents and all of that but the actual facts on the ground that Saddam Hussein wanted uranium from Niger that was correct the movie glides right over that says no no way and this is what the left always does when they can't have the facts on their side which is frequently they create fantasies in Hollywood so that's all people will remember I mean even for me I'm a conservative I'm a Republican I remember this scandal I've read a lot about this scandal some of the facts get a little confusing you have to check some dates people are gonna remember the movie JFK where it wasn't a communist to give some right-wing conspiracy they're gonna remember fair game these are the guys who are writing history it is it is a real assault on history and it's a way that the left always wins the culture this is you know Joseph Wilson the guy who wrote the original op-ed right he wrote the original op and he hadn't really done any investigation and they said to him nobody's gonna go see a movie fair game about this scandal and this is a direct quote this is where Joseph Wilson said he said for people who have short memories or don't read this is the only way they will remember the period and and they do it all the time I mean this is what it means to control the narrative it's just this is you know even even if you get it wrong in the moment you can get it wrong by making a movie about it that is the only thing as he said that people remember cuz I mean even as we're talking about it right it's a it's a minor weird story who can remember what scooter where scooter libby was and you know who can't even remember the vice president half the time the Ryan you know we remember Dick Cheney because we loved them but like still yeah you know like who can remember these things but it is exactly what has happened to Donald Trump it is this absolute barrage between the bureaucracy which is like a sort of a system for rejecting anybody who tries to come and get it you know it's like an a I'm trying but the immunity is an immune system that says that we will kill you if you come and try and fire us but it's also the press and Hollywood backing them up and this is why when we complain about this stuff this is why because they win history even when they lose the truth I told you I got to meet Scalia a couple times before he died we asked him what do you think is the greatest threat to American liberty he said the headless unaccountable bureaucracy really yeah the self-perpetuating bureaucracy and other reasonable people might say well the press the press is really lying and covering up for people and and what we see now is that the press the mainstream media utterly one-sided or lying and covering up for the bureaucracy I mean it is a really unholy alliance and it's a real threat to Liberty it's really hilarious to me when I think of all the flack the J Edgar Hoover got it for being a dishonest FBI guy who would come to you he would come to you and say yeah you don't want to do that because we have documents on you the show you were with Russian hookers so you don't want to do it you want to do what I want to do it it's hilarious to me to see journalists so-called saying oh wow you don't want to destroy the people's trust in the FBI and my feeling is wait you're a journalist that is your job you're destroyed you see this from a certain brand of conservative who doesn't like Donald Trump to all of a sudden the federal bureaucracy is sacrosanct bill kristol said if I have to choose between the deep state and the Trump State I'll choose the deep state and my feeling is everything you say after that sentences meaning it's our prediction so you and I are both walking out of this building after this and going on a trip I'm going to Grand Canyon University in Phoenix to talk about Christianity and the culture where you vote I was gonna I was gonna speak at the University of Phoenix I thought you know the online one I'm going to Alabama I'm gonna speak the Alabama Policy Institute nice in Mobile which should be a lot of fun and then on Thursday I'm going to Trump University itself the University of Pennsylvania I'll be speaking in John Huntsman Hall he's the ambassador to Russia I've seen colluding with the Russian ambassador and the speech will be on the topic this reasons to vote for Trump there you go this is the place where he learned all the best words that's real come on maybe I'll have it a little art of the deal with the protesters Michael Moses show is coming up and we will talk to you when you get back all right see drew all right our crappy culture so in all of podcasting is there a smoother segue between Michael Knowles and between Michael Knowles and our crappy culture I mean I think when you're talking to Michael is just our crappy culture just comes to mind so Mike Pompeo has been chosen by Donald Trump to replace Rex Tolson as the Secretary of State and you all know what the Secretary of State does right here's our chief diplomat he goes around the world and Cory Booker decided to question him on one of the truly important issues that comes up when the Secretary of State is going from place to place trying to stop wars from happening and this was the the moment is being gay a perversion senator I when I was a politician I had a very clear view on whether it was appropriate for two same-sex persons to marry I stand by that so you do not believe it's appropriate for two gay people to marry senator I continue to hold that view it's the same view and so people in the State Department I met some in Africa that are married under your leadership you do not believe that that should be allowed so we have a belief it's the case we have married gay couples at the CIA you should know I treated them with the exact same set of right believe you believe the gay sex is a perversion yes or no Senate if I if I can if yes or no if you believe that gay sex is a perverse because it's what you said here Center in one of your speeches yes or no do you believe gay sex is a perversions that are I'm gonna give you the same answer I just gave you previously my respect for every individual regardless of the sexual orientation it's the same now as you know the constitution for the religious tests for appointments and yet we've seen dianne feinstein complaining about someone believing in catholic dogma and this again he's saying in terms of his practice as a diplomat and as a CIA director he treats everybody the same his personal beliefs are really his own business and yet of course the press the press comes up and they back up cory booker in this moment here is CNN Wolf Wolf Blitzer and nia-malika Henderson cut thirteen that was a very strong extremely tough exchange and somebody's unexpected exchange Cory Booker is the progressive on this panel you've had a lot of gay rights groups raise these concerns about some of the comments that Pompeo has made in the past so you saw some of that exchange come up there and Pompeyo essentially relying on the same answer which is that he treats everybody fairly that people in the CIA have same-sex partners and he didn't treat them any differently but i think there is that issue again it can you promote human rights and equality in the way that typically secretaries of state have done and presidents have done if you do personally have this belief that same-sex marriage shouldn't happen and that essentially that people who are gay and lesbian aren't as equal and he stood by that unbelievable unbelievabl that is not enough for a man to treat each person equally this is something I'm gonna talk about this more as we go on woke culture as they now call it woke culture is racist culture woke culture is anti religious culture woke culture is sexist culture woke cultures all the things we climbed out of the mud and built this country to get away from woke culture which pretends to be progressive as the most regressive culture imaginable and it defines everything with which it disagrees as hatred and everything it disagrees with is out of bounds and so it encloses itself in a cyst of ignorance because if you can't hear people you disagree with you can never change your mind you can never learn new things this was appalling Pompeyo should have ripped into him I know he wants the appointment and I know you don't want to say to a senator or congressman you don't want to say you know basically go screw yourself but I think that they deserve it and we we really should be honoring them every single time every single time they go after an appointee for his religion it is unconstitutional all right we will be back I'll be on the road tomorrow but I will be here we will somehow through the miracle of modern technology will somehow get me on the air do we have a guest oh yeah tartar sauce he was on talking about he has a new book about the Constitution and the
