good morning John am Hank it's Friday

00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,200
John Hanke some days just<font color="#CCCCCC"> some days I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be a professional Lauren Conrad</font>

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,350

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,970
newfound positivity is all about you

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">going for your dreams and your ambitions</font>

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,830
guess that's what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do today so</font>

9
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast we have a classic Lauren didn't go</font>

10
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:16,680
to Paris she'll always be known as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

11
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,000
girl who didn't go to Paris do you

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,430
regret that decision gift so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

13
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,810
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> composure it's all about showing</font>

14
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,300
genuine despair and regret with even<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

15
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,220
slightest gestures<font color="#E5E5E5"> but within it there</font>

16
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,660
burns a fire knowing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one day</font>

17
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,060
perhaps towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of season</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

18
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of season three you will go to</font>

19
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:33,960
Paris while the shrug at first seems

20
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,520
like humble deference and it's also

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,829
rising to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge set before you the</font>

22
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,290
second and among my favorites is upgrade

23
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,180
in situations where socially it might

24
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,890
not be entirely acceptable for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

25
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,530
feel joy or delight however you do feel

26
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,210
joy and delight it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

27
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,710
upgrade in a way of continuing from the

28
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">theme of the last gear if the upgrade is</font>

29
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,530
all about when you've made a decision

30
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,210
that other people have criticized but

31
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,500
actually ends up working out in your

32
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">favor and you feel a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit smug</font>

33
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,949
just a bit I would be one hundred

34
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:01,079
percent remiss if i did a gift video and

35
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,809
didn't talk about cats where where I'm

36
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,549
gonna say anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lauren</font>

37
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,320
identifies with her spirit animal the

38
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,420
quiet cat who actually has all the power

39
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,159
the captain might be sweet and friendly

40
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always there to quit you or on</font>

41
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other hand the cap you might</font>

42
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
defecate in your food and eat you while

43
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,630
you sleep as<font color="#CCCCCC"> demonstrated by the other</font>

44
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,640
gifts and her angel light glowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lauren</font>

45
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,020
is clearly on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the good side of the cat</font>

46
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,670
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's fun to have a suggestion</font>

47
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be up there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also it's an excellent</font>

48
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:26,580
piece of advice whenever someone's

49
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,530
gossiping around you grab a cat that

50
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds dirty that he has a girlfriend</font>

51
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,009
gift perfectly captures the moment of

52
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">betrayal that could leave to a lifetime</font>

53
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,040
of trauma in the grand theme of

54
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,020
imagining people completely it says you

55
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,640
have to imagine complexity enough to

56
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,110
know that they could lie to you does

57
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,729
that mean we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> most vulnerable when</font>

58
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,110
we're betrayed or in a broader sense

59
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,579
when we're in conversation with other

60
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,930
people and we don't know what they're

61
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,700
going to say at least what's that circle

62
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,500
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trail has commenced now some</font>

63
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,540
examples of Lauren<font color="#CCCCCC"> ehrhoff Arceus on the</font>

64
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,829
first date don't tell me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked me</font>

65
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> girl you've ever met</font>

66
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,369
what's wisdom and it is through doing

67
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:57,840
those tasks through that work ethic

68
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,030
through going through physical items and

69
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,040
cleaning physical items and sorting

70
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,899
physical items but the real truths come

71
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,700
out from within us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real frustration</font>

72
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,469
the same can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimate</font>

73
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:09,300
classic gif and probably my favorite

74
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,910
scene of all time he's a sucky person in

75
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,300
it

76
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,680
someone who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> reached their limit and</font>

77
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,270
he was finally learned to stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

78
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,860
themselves in it is the struggle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

79
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,450
supporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> your friend without challenge</font>

80
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,460
or supporting your friend by telling her

81
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,750
things that she needs to know that

82
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,520
conflict manifests itself in the arm

83
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,990
movement now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first one I'm</font>

84
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,280
choosing to include<font color="#CCCCCC"> that involves other</font>

85
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,330
people because it's such a classic

86
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of the awkward moment the kind</font>

87
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of awkward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone what's</font>

88
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,130
everyone else to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is awkward but</font>

89
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,540
then at the same time no one really

90
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,190
knows what to do next the kind of moment

91
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,510
that is like an awkward<font color="#E5E5E5"> silence</font>

92
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,520
happening as someone saying oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> my god</font>

93
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an awkward silence why do we do</font>

94
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,850
that goes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to confusion there little</font>

95
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,230
bit but above all I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think your ties in</font>

96
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,910
most strongly with anger with knowing

97
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it might not be socially acceptable</font>

98
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,180
to speak up and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

99
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,620
things that you're holding within but

100
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,090
then also rejecting the idea that you

101
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:52,740
have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy and go lucky all the</font>

102
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,540
time so I know which side you fall in

103
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,160
that one the final gift are we talking

104
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,110
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today is consolation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at its finest</font>

105
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,970
homeboy wore combat boots to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach I</font>

106
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,020
know you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call that your</font>

107
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,760
boyfriend<font color="#E5E5E5"> because while kindness is good</font>

108
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,160
and judgment is bad sometimes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

109
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,260
to rip apart your<font color="#CCCCCC"> friend's ex to make</font>
