Britain's controversial former Prime Minister Tony Blair has bid to push his country to yet another military conflict this time in Syria in an interview Blair claimed that the UK should back a US intervention against Damascus in the wake of the alleged chemical attack the man who teamed up with Washington to invade Iraq in 2003 had this to say this would be action in support of military intervention by the the u.s. if you don't respond to this to the use of chemical weapons against civilians then obviously you know we're ignoring what the international community has said which is that this is unacceptable than those that use such methods should be held to account even if we take the action which I think we will have to do it doesn't solve the longer-term question of what happens in Syria I gave the order for British forces to take part in military action in Iraq my judgment as Prime Minister is that this threat is real growing and of an entirely different nature to any conventional threat to our security that Britain has faced before the program in the form that we thought it was did not exist in the way that we thought so I can apologize for that I can also apologize by the way for some of the mistakes in planning and certainly our mistaken in our understanding of what would happen once you removed the regime for all of this I express more sorrow regret and apology that you may ever know or can believe well the Iraq inquiry also known as the Chilcott report was published in 2016 and uncovered quote mistakes in a six year long UK campaign in Iraq the report revealed that there was no imminent threat to the UK or urgent need for military action against Saddam Hussein's government it also highlighted that Blair's certainty that Iraq stockpiling weapons of mass destruction including chemical and biological agents was unjustified the UK lost 179 men and women during the campaign it also claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians in 2016 a petition was uploaded on the UK's parliamentary website for the arrest of Blair for his role in the destruction of Iraq well than 20,000 signed the petition before it was removed with a journalist Kamala Lam told us that Tony Blair's just following the Western line on Syria says all about playing to the gallery this is all about headlines Twitter and media this is not about Syria what what's good for Syria as far as the u.s. France and UK goes it's making themselves feel good and patting themselves in the back sadly this is a tried and tested formula over the last seven years the West's make their mind up even before a minute has passed for any action on the ground and in this case the Americans the Europeans and the British have always wanted to be the judge jury and executioner and you can't do that any crime that's committed you you need to look at the evidence but if no one wants to look at the evidence then they want to look the other way
