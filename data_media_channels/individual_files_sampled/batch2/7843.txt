a Dallas cop is facing criminal charges following the shooting death of a man who was unfortunately in his own apartment while the cop walked into the wrong apartment and thought allegedly that he was a burglar so amber Geiger is the cop in question here and luckily there have been some charges filed against her she's a four year veteran with the Dallas Police Department and she allegedly went into the wrong apartment in her building and fatally shot Botham Shawn a 26-year old native of st. Lucia so she had parked her car this is what she's alleging after a 12-hour shift and she walked into the wrong floor apartment so she thought she claims she thought it was hers police said the officer returned to what she believed to be her apartment after her shift ended and that she was still in uniform when she encountered the victim here Geiger told investigators that she went to what she thought was her third-floor apartment instead she went to Shawn's fourth floor apartment directly above hers and she says that the door was ajar and that she saw a large silhouette inside and she thought that it was a burglar now what she's alleging what she's saying is different from what witnesses in the building are saying so she claims oh the door was ajar so I walked in but the witnesses said that they heard banging on the door that she was saying open up and so look that's what the witnesses are claiming this is what she's claiming the story seems very strange but luckily there is going to be an investigation because there are criminal charges being filed right now she's charged with manslaughter but prosecutors are saying that there could be additional charges as an investigation continues with that said though I do want to toss to this video it's a news report giving you a little more detail into what occurred attorneys for John's family say two witnesses told them details that contradict Giger's account they heard knocking down the hallway followed by a woman's voice that they believe to be officer Geiger saying let me in let me in the families attorneys say one of the witnesses then heard gunshots followed by a man's voice what we believe to be the last words of both them John which was oh my God why did she do that Alison Sean wants to know what happened to her son I'm not satisfied that we have all the answers and by the way one other part of this story before you jump in jank she says that he did not respond to her verbal commands maybe because you walked into his apartment and and that's not even clear that that he didn't respond to her verbal commands so we have states in the u.s. that that have passed Castle Doctrine laws allowing people to shoot a trespasser immediately immediately no questions asked I mean it's it's incredible that this cop walks onto his property into his home and opens fire I mean it's God help him if he had shot her do you think they would apply this castle doctrine or stand your ground or anything like that so she walks into a guy's apartment and says oh my god is a big black guy in my apartment I'm gonna shoot him and kill him and boom now look again at least here there's some degree of charge charges and hence justice at least the pursuit of justice in the beginning of justice but here's another cop shooting way too early what have they been trained everything's a threat threat threat threat make sure you're protected don't worry about the citizen right in this case I don't know if she was on something would how do you not know you're not going into your own apartment right and turns out you know before I tell you about the other innocent issues involved it I gotta say look I'm glad that NBC news in the particular article that I haven't read about the story first talked about what a great guy they would the victim but we immediate efforts a cop shooting we immediately investigate the person they shot for no reason that's right yeah so in this case they're like well he was going to a private Christian institution in Arkansas he belonged to good news singers the campus ministry he worked at price water scoopers as an associate and Rick risk assurance department so it's almost kind of like a but he was okay right I did doesn't matter what he was she burst into his apartment and murdered him so but anyway but glad didn't late least gave him good context usually they attack the person who's been killed by the conference cetera and it turns out that she had another physical confrontation and shot someone in may 12th of 2017 when she claims that that the guy was grabbing at her officers stun gun was he I don't know this is I mean it's two shootings within a little over a year okay and look again I want to give credit to the prosecutors who are looking at you who brought these charges but what are we trained our cops shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot ask questions later I remember growing up at a time where you would even see on TV where they would say freeze put your hands up you're under arrest there would be a little bit of a pause before they pulled the trigger and obviously you could tell from the witnesses when the guys last words were I can't believe you did that like burst into his apartment shoots him kills him and and and we're done with it on the go don't worry we got you covered you still listen to TYT at our new podcast network find us on Apple podcast at Google Play Store or at TYT comm slash podcast
