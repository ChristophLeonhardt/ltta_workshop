REPORTING.

12
00:00:14,365 --> 00:00:17,334
THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE THAT ROD

13
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,336
ROSENSTEIN VERBALLY OFFERED HIS

14
00:00:19,336 --> 00:00:19,336
ROSENSTEIN VERBALLY OFFERED HIS

I THINK IT’S WORTH NOTING IN AN

00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:38,389
I THINK IT’S WORTH NOTING IN AN

28
00:00:38,389 --> 00:00:39,791
INTERVIEW YOU HAD A SHORT TIME

00:00:43,594 --> 00:00:46,831
THERE IS ANOTHER PRESSURE POINT

32
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:46,831
THERE IS ANOTHER PRESSURE POINT

33
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:48,466

00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,276
IDEA THAT BY MAY OF 2017 REALLY

61
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:29,141
THERE HAD BEEN A PIVOT POINT IN

62
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:33,145
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION INTO

FIRING OF DIRECTOR COMEY.

00:01:36,548 --> 00:01:38,083
AND THAT REALLY IS ALSO AT THE

00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:39,918

>> Bill: A COUPLE OF THINGS.

72
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,259
GAETZ WAS SETTING HERE 30

73
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,795
MINUTES AGO AND TALKING ABOUT

00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:50,729

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:53,299
WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD GET THE

00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:53,599
VOTES.

78
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,167
HE DID NOT HAVE AN ANSWER.

79
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,102
WHETHER YOU HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT

80
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:56,102
WHETHER YOU HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT

81
00:01:56,102 --> 00:02:00,773
IN THE HOUSE TO DO IT IS

82
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:01,207
ANOTHER THING.

83
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:01,941
DID THEY HAVE SUPPORT?

84
00:02:01,941 --> 00:02:03,509
>> I DON’T WANT TO SPECULATE.

85
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:07,647
THEY GOT THE VOTES THEY NEEDED

86
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:08,848
FOR THIS RESOLUTION AGAINST ROD

87
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:08,848
FOR THIS RESOLUTION AGAINST ROD

88
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:09,247
ROSENSTEIN.

89
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:11,651
THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

90
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:12,585
PEOPLE FEELING VERY DEFLATED

91
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:14,921
WITH THE DECISION BY THE

92
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:17,390
PRESIDENT TO BACKTRACK ON THE

93
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,258
DECLASSIFICATION OF THESE

94
00:02:19,258 --> 00:02:19,592
RECORDS.

95
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:23,363
BUT CONGRESSMAN GAETZ SAID THAT

96
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:23,363
BUT CONGRESSMAN GAETZ SAID THAT

97
00:02:23,363 --> 00:02:24,630
WAS ANOTHER THREAT OR BIG STICK

98
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:24,630
WAS ANOTHER THREAT OR BIG STICK

99
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,199
THEY WERE HOLDING OVER THE

100
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:28,067
SITUATION WITH ROSENSTEIN.

101
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,235
>> Bill: ROSENSTEIN’S BOSS IS

102
00:02:29,235 --> 00:02:30,703
JEFF SESSIONS, RIGHT?

103
00:02:30,703 --> 00:02:32,772
>> CORRECT.

104
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:33,706
>> Bill: WHETHER ROSENSTEIN

105
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:36,643
RESIGNS OR WHETHER HE IS FIRED

106
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:37,610
OR WHETHER HIS RESIGNATION IS

107
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,212
ACCEPTED, PUT THAT ON THE BACK

108
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:40,380
BURNER FOR NOW.

109
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,781
IF HE IS NO LONGER AT THE

110
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:42,983
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WHAT

111
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:45,085
WOULD HAPPEN TO HIS JOB?

112
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:46,152
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE RUSSIA

113
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:46,486
MATTER?

114
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:47,921
HOW IS ANY OF THAT AFFECTED?

115
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:49,990
>> WELL, WHAT I CAN SAY WITH

116
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,992
ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY IS THAT

117
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:54,194
THERE HAS BEEN WHAT I’LL CALL A

118
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:54,194
THERE HAS BEEN WHAT I’LL CALL A

119
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,530
PLAN B IN THE EVENT THAT ROD

120
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,398
ROSENSTEIN WAS NO LONGER

121
00:02:58,398 --> 00:03:00,500
OVERSEEING THE RUSSIA

122
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,902
INVESTIGATION IN TERMS OF

123
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:03,070
PRESERVING RECORDS AND THE

124
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:05,839
INTEGRITY OF THE SPECIAL

125
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:06,540
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION.

126
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,474
BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING HERE

127
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:07,474
BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING HERE

128
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:09,610
AT THIS POINT IT WOULD GO TO

129
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,777
THE NUMBER THREE OR SOLICITOR

130
00:03:10,777 --> 00:03:11,845
GENERAL AT THE JUSTICE

131
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:12,246
DEPARTMENT.

132
00:03:12,246 --> 00:03:14,982
I DON’T WANT TO GO TOO FAR.

133
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:16,617
THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING PIECES.

134
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:16,617
THERE ARE SO MANY MOVING PIECES.

135
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:19,219
WE WANT TO FIRST STAY FOCUSED

136
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:21,288
WHETHER THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

137
00:03:21,288 --> 00:00:00,000
GENERAL HAS VERBALLY RESIGNED
