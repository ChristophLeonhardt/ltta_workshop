ALLISON HARTSON RUNNING
AGAINST DIANE FEINSTEIN IN
CALIFORNIA HAS A NEW AD OUT.
LET'S WATCH THE FIRST ONE.
DIANE, YOU'VE BEEN IN
CONGRESS FOR A QUARTER OF A
CENTURY WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO BE
READY FOR MEDICARE FRAUD?
WHAT JUST BE HONEST WITH THE
VOTERS AND SAY THAT YOU ARE
NEVER GOING TO BE READY
BECAUSE THAT IS NOT WHAT YOUR
DONORS WANT.
AFTER THAT TOWNHOUSE WHEN THIS
MONEY FROM HEALTHCARE
COMPANY AS WELL OUR FAMILIES ARE
SUFFERING.
THE PEOPLE OVERWHELMINGLY WANT
MEDICARE FOR ALL THAT THE
BIG PHARMA DONORS PROFIT OFF OF
SICK AMERICA.
THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THIS A
DEMOCRACY I'M GOING TO MAKE
SURE TO COUNTRY HEALTHCARE BY
FIGHTING FOR A MEDICARE
FOR ALL SYSTEM NOW.
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP
WAITING, FOR THIS NATION
THE PROSPEROUS PEOPLE.
YOU CAN MY FACE FOR YOU.
UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A
CENTER.
NOT FOLLOW THE MONEY.
DAMN.
THERE WE GO.
FEINSTEIN
HAS BEEN 
IN OFFICE FOR 15 YEARS.
SHE'S NEVER GOING TO DO MEDICARE
FOR ALL AND ALLISON HARTSON WAS
COMING WITH A 2 X 4 OVER THERE
SAYING WHILE OUR FAMILIES
WERE SUFFERING SHE WAS
COLLECTING CHECKS.
THIS IS WHY ALLISON HAS
OUTRAISED DIANE FEINSTEIN
AND ANOTHER PERSON IN THE RACE
COMBINED.
SHE HAS MORE VOLUNTEERS THAN
ANYONE ELSE IN THE RACE
COMBINED.
LET'S GO TO THAT ALLISON
HARTSON.COM/NOW.
IF YOU ARE IN CALIFORNIA GO
KNOCK ON DOORS, IT MAKES A
HUGE DIFFERENCE.
YOU CAN MAKE PHONE CALLS FOR
HER.
YOU CAN DO IT IN 15 SECONDS.
WE WILL HAVE THE LINKS DOWN
BELOW.
OF COURSE THOSE SMALL DOLLAR
DONATIONS MAKE ALL THE
DIFFERENCE.
DO A DONATION, SMALL DOLLAR
AMOUNT IS GREAT, AND A DONATION
IS GREAT SO WE CAN BEAT THOSE
CORPORATE DEMOCRATS AND GET
MEDICARE FOR ALL AND A REAL
PROGRESSIVE.
HERE COMES ALLISON.
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS YOU DO
WHEN YOU DON'T IT IS GIVEN THE
ABILITY TO RUN THAT ADD MORE IN
CALIFORNIA SO PEOPLE CAN FIND
OUT HOW AWFUL DIANE FEINSTEIN'S
RECORD IS.
SHE TELLS A CONSTITUENT I AM NOT
READY FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL YET.
THEN A WEEK LATER SHE GOES
AND COLLECTS CHECKS FROM
HEALTHCARE INDUSTRIES AND
REPRESENTS YOUR DONORS INSTEAD.
