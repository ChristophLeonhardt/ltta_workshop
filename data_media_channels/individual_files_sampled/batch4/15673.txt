hey remember this little ditty it's not easy being green yeah you have to wonder if Kermit was referring to government agencies using the public dime in the name of environmentalism the latest screw-up the province of Ontario's unintentionally funny rollout of electric car charging stations a project that essentially boils down to three words failure to launch well ho-hum another day another green energy Fiasco in Ontario recently Sheila Gunn read highlighted how numerous federal government departments in Ottawa have spent millions on electric car charging stations that are apparently only being used as photo ops as opposed to actually you know charging electric cars but at least the feds managed to get those chargers up and running which seems to be somewhat of a stretch goal when it comes to their counterparts running the province of Ontario consider the incredible expose by jenny yoon in the Toronto Sun here's the deal folks the Wynne Liberals announced plans in 2016 to spend 20 million dollars on a network of 500 charging stations for electric vehicles across the province the extensible policy reason for this infrastructure was to enable evey drivers to travel between and within cities boost electric car sales and of course fight climate change well much like the 1971 Ford Pinto this scheme probably looked good on paper but in real life it's been a disaster because as UN points out instead of a reliable affordable network of charging stations just over half the charging stations that were supposed to be constructed by last March have actually been built and most of those new charging stations are concentrated in downtown Toronto and the GTA an area that is already saturated with charging stations as you might recall most of those chargers were supposed to be located on provincial highways between cities that's where the Liberals originally said they were needed wow talk about range anxiety and it gets worse of the charging stations that have been built users complain that the software is already outdated the machines are often broken and overpriced and the company running these chargers delivers poor customer service Paul Reza ski founder of the Toronto electric vehicle Association has an idea as to why this might be the case in an article for the Sun he's quoted as saying the interior government awarded the lion's share of the charger contract worth some eleven point four million dollars to ksi a relatively unknown Mississauga green energy firm indeed it turns out that ksi was originally run out of the house of company founder Vic Burke onic bottom line yet again when it comes to the green file and unapologetic unaccountable and downright incompetent government over promises and under delivers but hey since this is the latest taxpayer-funded financial sinkhole and it's all in the name of fighting global warming or is it climate change how dare any of us have the audacity to complain it's all for a good cause after all for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's Lloyd Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary why not take the rebel with you please download our app you can do so at the Google Play Store for Android phones and for the iPhone by going to the Apple App Store you
