what would your lead be if you were the public editor of the New York Times how would you be tackling this well I actually did write a column about it today for the Washington Post and although it's not a typical public editor column where you're trying to do something different which is sort of internal refereeing I did come to the conclusion that I had no problem with the New York Times publication of this piece that I think it was irresistible in some ways and I also think that it had significant news value that was newsworthy the complaint I have is as you said with the writer of it who I think you know reasonably you could apply the word gutless to it that well there's a message there it's not exactly a new message and I think it's one that would have been much more effective with a name behind it as with so many things why do you assume it's newsworthy and I say this for this reason it's new it to me it's newsworthy depending on the title of this person what if it's just a mid-level political appointee does that make it Vince or thee I mean that's a question I have well obviously the farther up the food chain this person is the more newsworthy it is we're told that it's a senior administration official and I don't think the New York Times would would throw that phrase around lightly so I think it is someone fairly high up and some have argued actually that The Times has thrown that at that title around lightly I mean that would be that would be one of the emails you'd be getting a lot of from readers saying hey what is the New York Times definition of a senior administration official and is there you know how deep does that go right well Chuck I think we're going to find out sooner or later and I and I strongly suspect that it'll be sooner I don't have reason to think that but I believe it will and I think we're gonna recognize the name and that it'll be someone fairly high up and for that reason I think that the the kinds of things that were said and the voice that the person said it in which was very personal I think very egotistical you know makes it highly newsworthy hello youtubers if you're what this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meet the press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
