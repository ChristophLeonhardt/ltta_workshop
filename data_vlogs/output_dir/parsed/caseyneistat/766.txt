let's get you out there
okay ready shits 11 a.m. we are on the
move
Oscar Mike Oscar Mike your mother
alright traffic has been pretty uncool
we are currently having what candace
would describe as an emergency bathroom
situation run some gas station in some
town in between our departure and our
destination okay Bobby Gigi okay
everybody's doing fine Gigi went out for
a walk obligatory rest stop snack break
honestly this drive was a huge pain in
the ass before we had a baby and with
the baby it's like almost intolerable I
totally don't drive out here anymore
which is a bummer it's so nice to be out
of the city in the summertime
welcome to Connecticut
what are you under beach feel what lon
oh my god get over it no in a minute
look at this baby she needs some
sunshine Oh who's that who's there is
there your big brother Owen here in the
hoverboard
how you doing thank you
look at that lawn clean
going to the beach now this will be my
first time going to the beach in 2015
which is kind of crazy because when when
I got this house eight years ago
I literally would spend like 80% of my
summer sitting on this beach and now
it's like we're lucky if we make it here
one or two days a month
you hear that alarm I think that means
I'm going too fast
because well on the grass did you wake
up
good this is us yep whoa thank you this
place is called Scott's lobster dock if
you ever find yourself in New London
Connecticut come here get the lobster
roll telling your friend of mine and
they will give you nothing parents
watching the baby on the trampoline and
Owen just got back don't drop it
whatever you do don't drop it that is
probably the most laborious way you
could possibly put it in there but stick
with it on you got it obviously we're
gonna take my truck the movies tonight
first I got to get it ready
you had a nice shopping trip did you buy
anything for me that is kind of a gift
for me thank you
close that baby don't forget to lock
your door
holy smokes is packed in
I wouldn't say drastic world was a good
movie about it's extremely satisfying
put the ending was oh my god Casey hey
I'm gonna finally be on a vlog
