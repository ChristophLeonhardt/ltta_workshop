LARRY, GREAT TO SEE YOU.THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.
LARRY KUDLOW, AT THE WHITE
HOUSE.
JERMAINE WRIGHT OF CALIFORNIA
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN, DARRELL
ISSA.
HE SITS ON THE HOUSE FOREIGN
AFFAIRS AND JUDICIARY.
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.
THE HARDEST GUIDE TO FOLLOW.
YOU TALK ABOUT THE FREE
TRADERS.
THE FACT THAT HE IS AT THE
PRESIDENTS SIDE TELLS YOU THAT
TARIFFS ARE THE TOOL TO GET TO
FREE TRADE.
HIS VERY BEING IN THE
MINISTRATION SAYS THAT.
MARIA: ABOUT ISSUES ON CHINA
SPECIFICALLY?
THIS COULD GO ON FOR YEARS,
RIGHT?
DEALING WITH A DICTATOR FOR
LIFE, HE DOESN'T CARE.
>> WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO
MAKE CHINA DO WHAT THEY SAID
THEY WERE GOING TO DO.
I WAS IN CHINA A FEW WEEKS AGO
FOR THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM
THERE.
AND XI TALKED ABOUT TAX CUTS
AND DID 45 MINUTES OF A SPEECH
NO ONE BELIEVED BUT IT SOUNDED
GREAT!
YOU HAVE TO HOLD CHINA
ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT THEY SAY
THEY'RE GOING TO DO, NOT WHAT
THEY HAVE BEEN DOING.
WHICH INCLUDES SPYING ON US,
STEALING TECHNOLOGY, BULLYING
THEIR NEIGHBORS, THE MILITARY
ACTIVITIES IN THE SOUTH CHINA
SEAS.
THERE IS AN OLD EXPRESSION THAT
IN AMERICA WE ONLY DO TWO
THINGS WRONG.
AT THE PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL.
IT IS WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE
FAIL TO DO.
THE LAST COUPLE OF
ADMINISTRATIONS FAILED TO TAKE
CHINA ON.EVERYONE IS EXPECTED
BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT IS
TAKING CHINA ON.
I WOULD RATHER MAKE THE MISTAKE
OF TAKING CHINA ON THAN THE
GUARANTEED MISTAKE OF NOT DOING
IT AND ALLOWING THEM TO
CONTINUE TO GROW WITH A FALSE
ECONOMY.
MARIA: GIVEN THAT WE DO SO THE
NEW USNCA, DOES NOT EMPOWER THE
PRESIDENT TO HAVE A UNIFIED
FRONT AGAINST CHINA?
HE IS WORKING WITH THE
EUROPEANS TRYING TO DO ANOTHER
DEAL ON TRADE WITH THE EU AND
THE SAME WITH JAPAN.
HE NEEDS ALLIES TO GO UP
AGAINST, DOESN'T HE?
>> HE DOES, BUT WE WILL NEVER
HAVE THEM.
THE FACT IS, THESE TRADING
PARTNERS WILL BE OUR TRADING
PARTNERS.
MOVING FACTORS FROM CHINA TO
SOUTH KOREA AND VIETNAM AND
OTHER PLACES WILL BE PART OF
THE SOLUTION THAT CHINA CANNOT
GET ITS ACT TOGETHER.
BUT THE COURAGE OF AMERICA IS
NOT FOUND IN EUROPE.
THE COURAGE OF AMERICA IS NOT
EVEN FOUND IN JAPAN.
HIS PEOPLE TAKE WHAT CHINA IS
DOING WRONG AND EVEN TALK ABOUT
THE WTO COMPLAINTS.
THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO JOIN US
AND AGGRESSIVELY DO IT THIS
PRESIDENT IS DOING.
AND THAT IS OKAY.
WE CAN THINK OF ALL OF THE
TIMES IN WHICH AMERICA LED AND
IT WAS LONELY.
BUT AT THE END OF IT ALL,
PEOPLE SAID WE ARE SURE GLAD
YOU DID.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING
WITH TODAY.
I DO NOT WANT TO RAISE
EXPECTATIONS THAT SOMEHOW THE
EUROPEANS WILL GET -- IT IS NOT
IN THEIR DNA.
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE
SAME ALTERNATIVE TRADING
PARTNERS THAT WE ARE.
