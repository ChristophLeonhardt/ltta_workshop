NORTH KOREA RECENTLY RELEASED AN
AMERICAN WHO WAS DETAINED IN THE
COUNTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY, WE
NOW FIND THAT AUTO WARM BEER HAS
A SEVERE BRAIN INJURY AND HAS
BEEN IN A COMA SINCE HIS
ARRIVAL TO THE UNITED STATES.
DOCTORS CARING FOR THE RELEASED
NORTH KOREAN DETAINEE SAID
THAT HE IS NOT SPOKEN OR MOVED
ON HIS OWN SINCE HE ARRIVED
IN THE UNITED STATES ON TUESDAY,
A CONDITION THEY DESCRIBED
AS UNRESPONSIVE WAKEFULNESS OR
PERSISTENT VEGETATIVE
VEGETATIVE STATE.
HE ACTUALLY DID SUFFER FROM
EXTENSIVE LOSS OF BRAIN
TISSUE IN ALL REGIONS OF THE
BRAIN.
HE DOES OPEN HIS EYES AND BLINKS
SPONTANEOUSLY BUT DOCTORS
SAY HE SHOWS NO SIGNS OF
UNDERSTANDING LANGUAGE OR
RESPONDING TO VERBAL COMMANDS.
HE'S IN BAD SHAPE.
NORTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES SAY
WELL HE SUFFERED FROM
BOTULISM AND HE TOOK A SLEEPING
PILL AND THAT IS WHAT
CAUSED IT BUT OF COURSE THAT IS
NOT THE CASE.
THE DOCTORS IN THE UNITED STATES
DO NOT BELIEVE THAT'S THE CASE.
, HERE'S A STATEMENT FROM ONE OF
THE DOCTORS IN THE US.
WITH NO CERTIFIABLE KNOWLEDGE OF
THE CAUSE OR CIRCUMSTANCES
OF HIS NEUROLOGICAL INJURIES
THAT THIS PATTERN OF BRAIN
INJURY IS USUALLY SEEN AS A
RESULT OF CARDIOPULMONARY
ARREST REPORTS APPLIED TO THE
BRAIN IS INADEQUATE FOR A P
TIME, RESULTING IN THE DEATH OF
BRAIN TISSUE.
HE WAS DETAINED AFTER
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE ALLEGEDLY
FOUND HIM TAKING DOWN SOME SORT
OF POSTER OR BANNER AND AT THAT
POINT, WHILE HE WAS ABOUT TO
LEAVE THE COUNTRY, IS GOING TO
THE AIRPORT, HE WAS STOPPED AND
ARRESTED AND HE WAS ACCUSED
OF ESPIONAGE.
EXACTLY.
HE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF
COMMITTING A HOSTILE ACT AGAINST
THE COUNTRY AND SENTENCED TO 15
YEARS OF HARD LABOR.
HARD LABOR FOR THEM IS LEARNING
THE DANCE FROM THRILLER.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN
THE VIDEOS.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THEM?
ON YOUTUBE, YOU'VE SEEN THEM?
WAIT YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS?
YES.
THAT IT WAS JUST A JAB AT
MICHAEL JACKSON I WAS LIKE DAMN.
THEY HAVE TO WHEN THE
CHOREOGRAPHY OF THRILLER
AND THEY VIDEOTAPE IT. IT IS ON
YOUTUBE.
NORTH KOREAN PRISONERS AND IF
THEY DON'T DO IT EXACTLY,
THEY GET IN TROUBLE.
IT'S SICK.
I WOULD SAY THAT MY FIRST
INSTINCT WAS THERE SOME TRICK
BEING PUSHED BUT
THAT'S NOT TRUE, BUT THIS IS KIM
JONG-UN, KIM JONG-IL CLAIMED
TO SHOOT A 39 ON EVERY GOLF
COURSE AND SAID HE NEVER BOWLED A
GAME LESS THAN 300.
YOU KNOW THE STORY OF HOW HE
WAS BORN?
I WENT TO THE DMZ LINE BECAUSE I
WAS ENTERTAIN TROOPS AND
THEY MAKE YOU WATCH A MOVIE
ABOUT HOW 
HE WAS BORN.
HE FLEW OUT OF HIS MOTHER'S FOR
CHINA AND ASCENDED.
LITERALLY FLEW.
AND WHITE DOVE CAME OUT OF THERE
TOO.
HIS DAD LOVE MOVIES, BIG
MOVIE FAN WITH THE HUGE
MOVIE COLLECTION.
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF
WESTERN MOVIES BUT HE
WANTED TO START THE NORTH KOREAN
FILM INDUSTRY.
IT'S NOT A SUPER ARTISTICALLY
CREATIVE COUNTRY AS YOU MIGHT
IMAGINE SO HE KIDNAPPED SOUTH
KOREA'S LEADING ACTRESS AND HER
HUSBAND, A DIRECTOR, THEY WERE
KIDNAPPED 
AND SPENT,
12 YEARS OR SO IN NORTH KOREA
MAKING MOVIES THERE AFTER
THEY'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED BEFORE
THEY ESCAPED AND GOT BACK
ACROSS SO HE IS 
A LUNATIC SO THE
NOTION THAT THEY WOULD MAKE
THE PRISONERS DANCE TO
THRILLER, AT FIRST I WAS LIKE
YOU BEEN TRICKED AND THEN I
WAS LIKE NO, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT NORTH KOREA, THAT IS
PROBABLY TRUE.
I DON'T MEAN TO BLAME THE
VICTIM BUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE
ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO
AVOID TRAVELING TO NORTH KOREA.
PLEASE DON'T DO IT.
I KNOW THERE'S A MARKET FOR
PEOPLE WHO 
LIKE 
TO GO TO
COUNTRIES LIKE NORTH KOREA.
THEY THINK IT IS ADVENTUROUS.
DON'T PUT YOUR LIFE AT RISK LIKE
THIS.
PLEASE, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
IT WAS UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA IS
DOING. DON'T DO IT.
IT WAS GOING AROUND.
THEY SAY HE GOT BOTULISM TO GET
THE BRAIN INJURY.
HE DIDN'T.
THEY DID IT.
THEY KNOCKED HIM OVER AND THEY
HIT HIS HEAD AND THEN THEY
FINALLY LET THEM GO.
THEY PRAISE TRUMP FOR GETTING
THEIR SON OUT OF NORTH KOREA.
