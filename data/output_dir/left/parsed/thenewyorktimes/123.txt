President Trump, you are
meeting the most dangerous
man on our planet:
Russia’s bloody dictator,
Vladimir Putin.
Don’t be wowed by his toxic shirtless
masculinity or his judo skills.
He’s a silent killer
and a former K.G.B. officer who
has raped his own country
for profit and silenced
those who oppose him.
Yes, he’s small and unassuming, but
he’s much more sly than you.
I’m a founding member of
the Ukrainian feminist group
Femen.
We are a union of women who
are ready to protest topless
for their rights.
There are dozens
of our activists
who are protesting against
Putin everywhere in the world
now.
And we are not
scared to take him
on because we want
to protect women.
We want to protect the
world from this monster.
I’m the one who
screamed in his face,
“ you, dictator,” when he met with
world leaders in 2013.
I know that millions
of Russians, Ukrainians
and Syrians are dreaming of
telling him the same thing.
After our protest,
Putin’s security goons
at the F.S.B. attacked me and
my comrades. They surveilled us.
They beat us.
I’ve been arrested
more than 50 times.
I’ve been kidnapped by
Russia’s Secret Service.
They use their
massive influence
on Ukrainian judiciary to
get us thrown in prison.
They even had Ukrainian police
charge us with terrorism.
I managed to
survive and escape
and now I’m alive and
free, but living in exile.
I know you don’t care about
Putin’s bloody regime in Russia.
You don’t care about
political prisoners
or political
murders in Russia.
You don’t care
about women’s rights
to stay safe and free
from domestic violence.
You don’t care about the
L.G.B.T. community and their lives.
You don’t care about
Putin’s toxic influence
on the leaders of
other countries,
like in Syria, where
he’s propping up
a brutal dictator.
You don’t care
about my country,
Ukraine, where in 2014
Putin’s army invaded
and launched a now forgotten 
civil war that is still
ravaging the
lives of thousands
of people who are simply
trying to protect their own land.
You don’t care about Crimea,
which was annexed by Putin
and will always be
a part of Ukraine
no matter what
he says or does.
But I see you do care about
wielding your own power.
I’m warning you: don’t
be just another puppet
of this modern Russian tsar.
Try another way to leave
a historical legacy
if you dare. Try to fight Putin
with your strong position
with political and
economic sanctions.
Save us from Putin
and we will see
who really runs the world.
