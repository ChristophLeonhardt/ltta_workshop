he was my brother yeah it's like an
asteroid fell out of the sky
we have no he hasn't yeah those things
oh yeah now it's last time I talked to
him was he texted me to ask how my mom
was after we didn't have power for five
days in the neighborhood you know he
talked to her on the phone a week or two
ago and didn't send her a walker because
she's having trouble walking
do you think I mean I thought I was
trying to convey that a little bit well
that's why we're like I said this is
like an asteroid no there's no I mean
he had no machine guns when I moved him
from Melbourne to mesquite I mean find
out who gave you know who we bought the
machine guns from and once again
it's there's no Gleeman you know it's
just he bought the machine guns and he
did this I mean it was him who did this
there's no doubt about it because he was
him I mean he was lately out of
character
he's never sure I mean he's never even
drawn his gun
oh yeah it makes no sense he's never hit
anybody he's never gonna through this
door just yeah a couple of handguns I
think yeah we had a safe with a couple
handguns he might have had one long
rifle we didn't have any I mean he had
no automatic weapons when that I know
that I knew over at any time I there's
no it just
just makes no sense
