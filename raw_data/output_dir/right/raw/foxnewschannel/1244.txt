00:00:08,282 --> 00:00:10,084
>> AFTER MORE THAN A CENTURY OF

2
00:00:10,084 --> 00:00:11,385
TEACHING MILLIONS OF AMERICAN

3
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:13,687
BOYS MARKMANSHIP, WOOD CRAFTS,

4
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:15,622
PATRIOTISM, GOOD CITIZENSHIP,

5
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,558
THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA HAVE

6
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:19,426
DECIDED TO CHANGE COMPLETELY,

7
00:00:19,426 --> 00:00:21,128
STARTING WITH THEIR NAME.

8
00:00:21,128 --> 00:00:27,067
IT'S NOW THE SCOUTS, GENDER

9
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:29,570
NEUTRAL.

10
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:31,004
NUMBER ONE SHOW, CALLED

11
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:32,606
"RETURNING THE FAVOR."

12
00:00:32,606 --> 00:00:34,842
WE SPOKE TO HIM RECENTLY.

13
00:00:34,842 --> 00:00:36,810
THANKS A LOT FOR JOINING US.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,946
YOU WERE FAMOUSLY AN EAGLE SCOUT

15
00:00:38,946 --> 00:00:39,746
AS A BOY.

16
00:00:39,746 --> 00:00:41,381
THE SCOUTS ARE NO LONGER THE BOY

17
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,283
SCOUTS BUT SIMPLY THE SCOUTS.

18
00:00:43,283 --> 00:00:44,651
WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?

19
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:47,187
>> WELL, IT'S FUNNY UNDER ASK,

20
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:48,922
BECAUSE NO LESS THAN 10,000

21
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:50,224
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME THAT VERY

22
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,225
QUESTION OVER THE LAST MONTH.

23
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:52,392
>> I BET.

24
00:00:52,392 --> 00:00:55,496
>> ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE,

25
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:56,797
DISTINGUISHED EAGLE SCOUT, IF

26
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:58,298
YOU'RE KEEPING SCORE, FIVE OR

27
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:01,235
SIX YEARS AGO I WAS AWARDED

28
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:01,535
THAT.

29
00:01:01,535 --> 00:01:02,503
IT WAS VERY TOUCHING.

30
00:01:02,503 --> 00:01:04,104
LOOK, I'M WATCHING WHAT'S

31
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:08,008
HAPPENING CAREFULLY.

32
00:01:08,008 --> 00:01:10,577
I'VE SENT 50,000 TO 55,000

33
00:01:10,577 --> 00:01:12,646
LETTERS OUT OVER THE LAST 10

34
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,281
YEARS TO OTHER EAGLE SCOUTS.

35
00:01:14,281 --> 00:01:15,883
I THINK THE COUNTRY NEEDS THE

36
00:01:15,883 --> 00:01:16,216
SCOUTS.

37
00:01:16,216 --> 00:01:18,085
I THINK THE COUNTRY NEEDS THE

38
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:21,522
FUTURE FARMERS OF AMERICA AND

39
00:01:21,522 --> 00:01:24,958
SKILLS USA AND 4-H, DESPERATELY,

40
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:25,526
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

41
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:28,162
IT CONCERNS ME TO SEE ALL THE

42
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:31,064
CONFUSION SWIRLING AROUND THE

43
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:34,301
ORGANIZATION, BUT LIKE SO MANY

44
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:36,737
WOUNDS I'M AFRAID SO MANY OF

45
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:37,804
THESE ARE SELF-INFLICTED.

46
00:01:37,804 --> 00:01:39,673
I ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF THE

47
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:40,908
CONFUSION GOING ON IS

48
00:01:40,908 --> 00:01:41,441
LEGITIMATE.

49
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:43,277
I READ THEIR OFFICIAL STATEMENT.

50
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:45,679
WHILE GIRLS ARE BEING WELCOMED

51
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,981
IN, I DIDN'T READ ANYTHING ABOUT

52
00:01:47,981 --> 00:01:50,317
INTEGRATED CAMPING TRIPS OR

53
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:50,851
TROOP MEETINGS.

54
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,420
I THINK IT'S A PLAY TO COMPETE

55
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,454
WITH THE GIRL SCOUTS.

56
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,490
I UNDERSTAND WHEN THE GIRL

57
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,624
SCOUTS ARE UPSET, BUT SINCE WHEN

58
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:59,459
IS COMPETITION A BAD THING?

59
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:00,594
I THINK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

60
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:01,995
AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT HAVE

61
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:03,664
NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN

62
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:04,865
THEY ARE TODAY.

63
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:08,435
SO MY HOPE IS THAT THE BOY

64
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,070
SCOUTS ASSUME THE OPPORTUNITY

65
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,838
THAT'S PRESENTING ITSELF, AND

66
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,242
BECOME AN ANTIDOTE FOR THE SAFE

67
00:02:15,242 --> 00:02:17,744
SPACE ENVIRONMENT THAT'S OUT

68
00:02:17,744 --> 00:02:19,546
THERE, AND PUSH BACK A LITTLE

69
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:20,047
BIT.

70
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:21,281
NOT TO SOUND LIKE THE ANGRY GUY

71
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:22,849
ON YOUR NEIGHBOR'S PORCH YELLING

72
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,418
AT THE KIDS ON THE LAWN, BUT

73
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:27,888
WHEN I WAS IN THE SCOUTS, IN '64

74
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:31,525
AND '75, IT WASN'T A SAFE SPACE

75
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,659
IN THE BASEMENT OF OUR CHURCH,

76
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:35,062
YOU'D GO HOME WITH A BLOODY NOSE

77
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:36,463
OR A BLACK EYE.

78
00:02:36,463 --> 00:02:37,564
WE HAD A BOXING RING.

79
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:40,300
IT WAS A VIBRANT PLACE WHERE YOU

80
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,105
REALLY COULD TEST YOURSELF AND

81
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,441
HANDMADE YOU SAFE ENOUGH TO

82
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:48,375
ATTEMPT, BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND,

83
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,277
DIDN'T TRY AND CHECK EVERY BOX

84
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:52,913
AND PLEASE EVERY SINGLE PERSON.

85
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:55,215
IT'S A TOUGH TIME.

86
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:56,917
YOU KNOW, I'M SYMPATHETIC FOR

87
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:59,453
THE LEADERS, BUT I'M AFRAID

88
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:01,154
YOU'VE GOT TO DRAW THE LINE AND

89
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:02,422
BE CLEAR WHAT YOU STAND FOR AS

90
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:02,990
WELL AS AGAINST.

91
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,692
>> SO YOU DON'T SEE THIS AS THE

92
00:03:05,692 --> 00:03:07,194
END OF SOMETHING THEN?

93
00:03:07,194 --> 00:03:07,995
>> I DON'T KNOW.

94
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:11,398
I MEAN, AGAIN, YOU EITHER EVOLVE

95
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:13,600
OR YOU -- OR YOU DIE.

96
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,636
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK

97
00:03:15,636 --> 00:03:17,771
PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED BECAUSE THE

98
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,473
SCOUTS SIMPLY HAVEN'T COME OUT

99
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:22,042
AND SAID CATEGORICALLY WHAT

100
00:03:22,042 --> 00:03:24,344
THEY'RE FOR, RIGHT?

101
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:26,880
SO I JUST THINK THIS

102
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,181
CONVERSATION TOUCHES ON EVERY

103
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:29,683
SINGLE POINT RIGHT NOW GOING ON

104
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:31,018
IN POPULAR CULTURE, FROM

105
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:34,054
TOLERANCE TO ACCEPTANCE, WHICH,

106
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,722
BY THE WAY, I'M NOT SURE WHAT

107
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:36,757
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO

108
00:03:36,757 --> 00:03:37,991
THINGS IS ANYMORE, BUT THERE

109
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,526
USED TO BE A BIG DIFFERENCE.

110
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:42,262
PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING FOR THEIR

111
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:42,796
OWN IDENTITY.

112
00:03:42,796 --> 00:03:44,831
LOOK, THE LAST TIME I WAS ON, WE

113
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,900
TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT

114
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,307
EVERYTHING IS EITHER BEING

115
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,941
OR EVERYTHING IS BEING INFORMED

116
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:57,678
BY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE

117
00:03:57,678 --> 00:03:58,078
CHALLENGED.

118
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:59,479
I THINK PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE TO

119
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:00,480
BE CHALLENGED.

120
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,216
MY HOPE FOR THESE YOUTH-BASED

121
00:04:03,216 --> 00:04:05,619
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP PREACH

122
00:04:05,619 --> 00:04:07,587
CHARACTER IS THAT THEY LOOK FOR

123
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:10,357
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE

124
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:11,892
CHALLENGED, AND NOT CURRY FAVOR

125
00:04:11,892 --> 00:04:13,994
SO MUCH WITH THOSE WHO WANT A

126
00:04:13,994 --> 00:04:15,295
NICE REASSURING PAT ON THE HEAD.

127
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:16,663
>> YEAH.

128
00:04:16,663 --> 00:04:19,632
THAT'S HOW THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH

129
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:19,933
DIED.

130
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,969
>> YEAH.

131
00:04:22,969 --> 00:00:00,000
WOW.
