WE WISH YOU THE BEST.

>> NEWLY CONFIRMED PROMISES HAVE

6
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:21,786
BEEN MADE AND DASHED.

7
00:00:21,786 --> 00:00:24,155
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THIS TODAY.

8
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:24,889
>> President Trump: NO, I DON'T

9
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:25,456
THINK HE'S PLAYING.

10
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:26,324
NO I DON'T THINK HE'S PLAYING.

11
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:27,992
IT IS NEVER GONE LIKE THIS.

12
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:30,094
IT HAS NEVER GONE THIS FAR.

13
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:32,229
I DON'T THINK IT HAS THIS

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,598
ENTHUSIASM FOR THEM WANTING TO

15
00:00:33,598 --> 00:00:37,201
MAKE A DEAL.

16
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,503

AND THE FORMER PRESS SECRETARY

FOR NICKY HILLY.

GENTLEMEN.

22
00:00:46,911 --> 00:00:48,079
WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,347
>> THANK YOU, SHANNON.

24
00:00:49,347 --> 00:00:50,915
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS.

25
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:53,684
>> CHRISTOPHER HILL A LEAD

26
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:54,886
NEGOTIATOR WITH NORTH KOREA

27
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:56,754
UNDER THE GEORGE W BUSH SAYS.

28
00:00:56,754 --> 00:00:58,356
>> IT IS A START WHAT WE'RE

29
00:00:58,356 --> 00:00:59,991
HEARING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH

30
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:00,291
KOREA.

31
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,893
I'M GUIDED BY MY EXPERIENCE.

32
00:01:01,893 --> 00:01:04,194
THEY SAY ALL THE RIGHT THINGS

33
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:06,430
BUT GAVE US A DECLARATION NOT

34
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,032
COMPLETE AND ENTIRELY ACCURATE

35
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:10,501
AND FAILED TO GIVE US ANY

36
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:11,702
VERIFICATION PROTOCOL.

37
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:13,971
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE TOUGH NEXT

38
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,542
STEPS THAT COME FROM, YOU KNOW

39
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,477
THIS HAPPY GLOW OVER WHAT'S

40
00:01:19,477 --> 00:01:23,114
HAPPENING IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH

41
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:25,616
KOREA, BUT GETTING TO BRASS TAX.

42
00:01:25,616 --> 00:01:26,517
>> I THINK THERE'S GREAT REASON

43
00:01:26,517 --> 00:01:28,686
TO BE OPTIMISTIC, BUT I THINK

44
00:01:28,686 --> 00:01:30,121
THE WARNINGS CLEARLY MATTER A

45
00:01:30,121 --> 00:01:30,755
LOT THERE.

46
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:32,657
ARE SOME VERY STICKY ISSUES.

47
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,859
THE QUESTION OF U.S. PRESENCE IS

48
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:37,195
SOMETHING THAT FOR, EXAMPLE, THE

49
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:39,430
NORTH KOREA CONSIDER TO BE A

50
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,364
NONSTARTER GOING FORWARD.

51
00:01:40,364 --> 00:01:42,967
FOR THE UNITED STATES THERE IS

52
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:44,202
BY QUESTIONS AROUND

53
00:01:44,202 --> 00:01:45,803
NUCLEARIZATION.

54
00:01:45,803 --> 00:01:49,073
IS KIM JUNE UNIT SERIOUS ABOUT

55
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:51,375
ENDING HIS NUCLEAR PROGRAMMING?

56
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:53,477
THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS HE WILL

57
00:01:53,477 --> 00:01:56,080
SIT DOWN SHOULD HE SIT DOWN WITH

58
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,949
KIM JONG-UN.

59
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:59,884
I THINK THE PRESIDENT DESERVES

60
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:00,218
CREDIT.

61
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:03,487
BUT IT IS STILL A MAMMOTH TASK.

62
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,223
>> THERE WERE SKEPTICS WHETHER

63
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:07,692
WE WOULD GET TO THIS MOMENT.

64
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:08,893
>> BEN ROSE OF THE OBAMA

65
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:11,095
ADMINISTRATION TWEETED IN

66
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:13,431
SEPTEMBER EVERY TAUNT BACK AND

67
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:17,034
FORTH BETWEEN TRUMP AND KIM

68
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:18,603
JONG-UN MEANS DIPLOMACY LESS

69
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:19,237
POSSIBLE.

70
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:20,738
>> SAYING WE ARE FAR CLOSER TO

71
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,240
ACTUALLY CONFLICT OVER NORTH

72
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,775
KOREA THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

73
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:27,712
REALIZE GEORGE SOR, OS SAYING

74
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,814
THE UNITED STATES IS SET ON THE

75
00:02:29,814 --> 00:02:31,048
COURSE TOWARDS NUCLEAR WAR.

76
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:32,116
DO YOU THINK ANY THOUGHT WE

77
00:02:32,116 --> 00:02:34,652
WOULD GET TO THIS POINT WHERE

78
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,586
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE HAS TO

79
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,521
CLOSE THE DEAL AND A LOT TO DO,

80
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:38,689
DO YOU THINK THEY EVER THOUGHT

81
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,558
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR WOULD

82
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:42,460
HAPPEN ON HIS WATCH?

83
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,295
>> THOSE PICTURES WE ALL WATCHED

84
00:02:44,295 --> 00:02:45,630
YESTERDAY, AND THIS MORNING, AS

85
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,265
THEY HAVE BEEN REPLAYED HAVE

86
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:48,866
BEEN REMARKABLE.

87
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,835
WE REALLY ARE SURPRISED BY WHAT

88
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:53,337
HAS TRANSPIRED CERTAINLY BETWEEN

89
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,739
THE TWO-GOAL KOREAS.

90
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,574
BUT AS YOU SAY THERE'S A LONG

91
00:02:56,574 --> 00:02:59,110
WAYS TO GO TO WORK THINGS OUT.

92
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,511
ALL SORTS SORTS

93
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:01,746
OFICALLYIFICATIONS LIE AHEAD,

94
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:04,548
FROM HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY PUT

95
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,484
SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN MOTION TO

96
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:09,153
BRING TO KOREAS WITH COMPLETELY

97
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:09,754
DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTS.

98
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:12,156
ONE COMPLETELY AUTOCRATIC, THAT

99
00:03:12,156 --> 00:03:13,157
HAS BEEN CRUEL TO ITS OWN

100
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:13,491
PEOPLE.

101
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,693
ANOTHER ONE, THAT IS A LIBERAL

102
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:18,029
DEMOCRACY IN COMPARISON WITH A

103
00:03:18,029 --> 00:03:20,097
FREE ECONOMY?

104
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:22,900
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

105
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,301
ASPIRATIONS.

106
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:27,271
THAT WERE AT WAR, AND STILL ARE

107
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:28,673
THAT HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

108
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:29,473
ANOTHER THAT DONE.

109
00:03:29,473 --> 00:03:31,909
ONE THAT IS STILL AT WAR WITH

110
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:33,077
THE UNITED STATES.

111
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:34,845
LOTS OF COMPLICATIONS ALL OF

112
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:36,147
THOSE LOVELY PICTURES THAT WE

113
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:39,917
SAW THAT LOOK SOUP LISTING BELIE

114
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:44,088
A VERY COMPLICATED ROAD AHEAD.

115
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:44,855
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING INTO

116
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:46,190
NEGOTIATIONS, IF THEY ACTUALLY

117
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,226
DO HAPPEN IN A VERYICALLYCATED

118
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:49,593
SITUATION.

119
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:52,730
NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU REALLY

120
00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:04,942
WANT TO RUSH INTO.

121
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:09,613
WANT TO RUSH INTO.

122
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:11,415
NOW WE FIND OURSELVES IN A

123
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,850
DIFFERENT SCENARIO.

124
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,185
>> IT IS NOT JUST THE KOREAS AND

125
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:14,919
THE U.S.

126
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:16,187
OTHER PARTIES AND OTHER NATION

127
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,456
ALSO HAVE SOME SAY WHETHERRER

128
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,923
OUT FRONT OR THROUGH BACK DOORS

129
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:20,825
LIKE CHINA.

130
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,760
>> THAT IS TRUE.

131
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,260
>> ABSOLUTELY.

132
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:23,894
>> LONNY.

133
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:25,096
>> THE CHINESE, NO.

134
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,431
THE CHINESE ARE CRITICAL IN THIS

135
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:27,832
DISCUSSION.

136
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:29,266
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

137
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,769
THEY WERE ACTUALLY A PARTY TO

138
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:36,741
THE ORIGINAL END OF HOST STILT

139
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:39,210
OR THE TERMINATION OF HOSTILITY

140
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,678
AAGREEMENT IN THE 1950S.

141
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:42,012
THEY'RE PARTY AND THEY'RE

142
00:04:42,012 --> 00:04:44,715
WATCHING WITH A VERY CAREFUL EYE

143
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:45,383
TOWARDS NORTH KOREA.

144
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:48,386
IN A LOT OF WAYS, CHINA CONTROLS

145
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:49,220
THE WILL LEVERS.

146
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,921
IT IS REALLY THE ELEPHANT IN THE

147
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,656
ROOM, WHEN IT COMES TO WHERE

148
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:53,324
NORTH KOREA GOES.

149
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,593
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

150
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:57,528
KIM JONG-UN WILL NOT DO ANYTHING

151
00:04:57,528 --> 00:05:00,364
THAT RUNS ACROSS THE CHINESE.

152
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:02,133
FUNDAMENTALLY THE ROAD TO PEACE

153
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,168
IN THE KOREAN PENINSULA AND IN

154
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,170
TERMS OF BRINGING NORTH AND

155
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,304
SOUTH TOGETHER WILL STILL

156
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:09,039
LARGELY BE DICTATED BY THE

157
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,541
DISCUSSIONS THE U.S. HAS WITH

158
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,476
CHINA, WHICH IS COMPLICATED

159
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:15,579
FURTHER WE'RE PLAYING THE THREE

160
00:05:15,579 --> 00:05:17,448
DIMENSIONAL GAME OF CHESS WITH

161
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:18,983
CHINA, GIVEN THE TRADE

162
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:19,350
SITUATION.

163
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,652
ALL OF THE FACTOURS HAVE TO BE

164
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:22,520
TAKEN TO INTO ACCOUNT.

165
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,721
>> IT IS JUST THE BEGINNING.

166
00:05:23,721 --> 00:05:25,523
IT IS HOPEFUL TO SEE HIS IMAGES

167
00:05:25,523 --> 00:05:27,558
BUT A VERY LONG ROAD TO GO

168
00:05:27,558 --> 00:00:00,000
LEADING US FORWARD.
