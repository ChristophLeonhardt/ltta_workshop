all right well in the Young Turks coverage of the Medicare all for all Town Hall that Bernie Sanders just had in Washington DC a little bit later tonight in about twenty minutes or so we're gonna have Nina Turner on on rebel headquarters talking about Medicare for all what our revolution is doing to fight for it she's the president of our revolution it just started by Bernie Sanders we'll also have some people who started watch events for for this town hall to see how that one as well alright so Jimmy door Jane Kyogre John I'd roll with you guys and I want to go through what we just heard there so I've got a broken down into a couple of topics in my head so let me start with numbers so we just watched Bernie Sanders medicare-for-all town hall and a couple of numbers stood out to me first of all 36 people 36 I wish I was the only 36 36 thousand people died last year and I every year because they don't have health insurance in America just let that sink in for a second 9/11 was a little under 3,000 people so that's 12 911s per year this is it's not a spectacular event it's not one covered every day it doesn't have it at 36,000 people at once we just ignore it but it is a fact it happens every year and so it's unbelievable and and and later in the in the Town Hall if you don't hour and a half of the last session was about how other countries handle health care and what we can learn from it and in all the other developed countries Norway one of Donald Trump's favorite countries apparently they had an expert from Norway on there who was the doctor from there and they said it's unconscionable to think about not having insurance people don't understand what that means so it Canada same thing so they're like wait I don't get it you just let people die and our answer seems vicious and deeply immoral to them yeah we just let them die and and there was a doctor or earlier in the program we talked about people who come into the emergency room right before they die and so the Republicans say or you go to the emergency room like yeah but the person came in that insurance so they never did checkups so we never caught their diabetes so they come into the emergency room to die and that's what we have in America and so let's just acknowledge the depth of the problem then you talk about how about finances you know problems arose all cost too much no no it's the exact opposite of the truth that's why it's maddening that this wasn't covered by cable news outlets and said are we covered it but it's it's so many of their advertisers put out this propaganda which then you hear in cable news but the reality is it costs nine thousand eight hundred dollars per person in America for every person health care costs every year so Canada has a life expectancy that is three years older than ours they have a system measured by doctors and experts that is demonstrable better than us they have better health care than us you know how much it cost them well if it cost ninety eight hundred dollars per person for us it must cost them what fifteen thousand we were ten thousand fifty no four thousand six hundred we cost nine thousand eight hundred get worse results they cost four thousand six hundred get better results so why are we doing this and other doctors said look I spent half my time filling out insurance forms bureaucracy we're talking about bureaucracy all I do is with his insurance bureaucrats hey my patient is dying for God's sake can I give them some sort of treatment well I don't know you fill out the forms and have them fill out the forms and we'll see what happens and then she said so some guy comes in and he's got a four dollar deductible the next person comes in has the same exact problem has a twelve hundred dollar deductible well I mean so what so one of them gets to live the other one gets to die because he doesn't have to twelve hundred dollars the doctor from Canada who was on later in the program said you know we have no deductibles and I just think about that for a second and what a sigh relief we would all have as a country in in in all the rest of the developed world they say it's not practical no our system is the one that's not practical it's the most expensive it is double what almost all developed countries pay for worse results and yes and we stress ourselves out like where we're going to get health care how good can I afford it can I not afford it so in Canada and all those other countries no deductibles no Co pace it on top of that you've got no assurance forms and this one actually got to me the most I don't know why but no medical bankruptcies so no one has to ever worried hit like hey I got cancer so am I gonna have to am I gonna lose my house am I gonna lose my business hey hey my mom or my wife or my uncle he they got they had a stroke are we all finished are we all done because we all have to put all of our money in to try to save their life and then we've lost our hosts we lost our bankruptcy for the rest of the developed world they're like what kind of what kind of a monstrous system says you get a health care problem and you don't have the right insurance you picked the wrong thing etc and that's it bankruptcy if we can cheat we would have lower costs and then finally Bernie said look the good thing is we don't have to invent a new system we already have it it's Medicare and it is among the top two most popular programs in the entire country Social Security is number one Medicare is number two and all we have to do is let other people in another one of the the business men that were in and they had business men in there as well and they said well look we already have a system that works and that's incredibly far popular and it gives you some sort of relief and so like people are racing to get to 65 and they stole the story about how people are coming and and working at jobs they don't want to work at cuz they it has decent health insurance I actually know a story like that of someone who was really high up at MSNBC in her 60s he said he had to come back to MSNBC come out of retirement because his wife was sick and so he had to they had to hang in there until they turned 65 so he to go back to a job you didn't want to do come out of retirement and because they've got sick so then we got a we just got to make it to 65 why do we ask the whole country have to wait till we get to 65 and we already have the system why don't we just let everyone in so you can all have a little bit of relief and again it's cheaper so it makes no since not to do it last thing for me is that here's why we do do it as is Sanders again pointing out in the middle the pharmaceutical industry alone not the rest of healthcare just the pharmaceutical industry and not in campaign contributions just in lobbying spends 3.6 billion dollars a year so that's why we don't have a far more rational system that cost less that covers people better that allows us relief and decency and equality okay the woman from doctor from Norway said we treat poor people middle class people and rich people the same they all get health care I mean it made me think of what we used to talk about during the primaries whisper of a dream could you imagine if in America we were all treated equally and it actually cost less money and the only reason we don't is because we have an insane system where we allow them to spend billions of dollars corrupting our system through lobbying campaign contributions the number one donors are not the oil companies they're not the banks it's the pharmaceutical companies and lo and behold they have monopolies Medicare the one problem Medicare is because the government is so bought and corrupt by these companies they're not allowed to negotiate with drug companies again the woman from Norway the guy from Canada like what do you mean you can't negotiate with drug companies you represent the people how could the companies rule the people well that's what we have in America and that's why we have the disastrous system that we do yeah yeah and I mean look as you point out all we have to do is change the number on when you become eligible for it we just put it down to one or guess technically zero and we know that government bureaucrats know how to do that I mean they keep pitching raising Social Security eligibility they want to change that number okay well why don't we pass it out why don't we change another the number down there we know that they can do it that 36,000 is is absolutely crazy I would love to see is there any other country that has sort of a per capita rate like that and obviously we know we can expect that that number is going to go up because the tax bill got rid of the individual mandate and estimates say 13 million people will lose their health insurance because of that and so that number is going to be higher now more than 30 6000 but yeah the thing that I want to focus on briefly and what I love about burning why I love listening to him is that he it they kept calling him like a pie in the sky progressive like but he's not he's a fundamentally pragmatic politician and he kept he kept saying there and I'm glad that he brought those those health care professionals on to talk about this like we need single-payer and I fundamentally believe that we're going to get and I don't think it's going to take too long but that is not the end of history when we get that as I try to remind people there are people who haven't been born yet that will be born grow up go into politics and then spend their careers trying to take out the single-payer health care system we're going to set up but even once we get the single that payer health care system that is just the beginning I mean in Canada they're trying to make theirs better in the UK they're trying to make theirs better that is just the beginning to a number of other foundational and structural changes we need to make societal changes we need to make to take down the cost of health care and make sure that people get the best health care possible this is just a very necessary and important first step in that direction Jack I just want to add one quick thing to that bernie asks the experts together with doctors from canada in Norway is there any politician in your country in canada had a conservative prime minister fairly recently said is there any one the most conservative politician you have in norway or in canada who would suggest taking away single-payer and they again almost laughed out loud like who would be crazy enough to suggest that they'd get voted out of office immediately well if every developed country that has single-payer loves it so much that any politician anywhere in the political spectrum would immediately lose their job if they suggested taking it away maybe there's something to that yeah and i think our country is so messed up i mean there are people who every year try to cut your social security benefits there's people try to kill medicare and medicaid every single year i mean these are insanely popular programs perhaps the best government programs our country has ever had and every single year we have to protect them from cuts well we've sick politicians in our country well it's the it's neoliberalism that wants to privatize everything and so it's it's not even to one party right because even Barack Obama proved it and had the grand bargain which everyone knows was to cutting Social Security and Medicare so the thing that I love the thing I like the most I heard tonight was that was when they woman from Cook County said we already pay enough money for health care we don't have to pay any more money to get health care for everybody in the United States would have to pay one cent more we already paid twice as much so if people just thought about that so while you have 30 million people left out of health care even under Obamacare we don't have to spend one more penny to insure all those people that's just a mind-blowing thing and then we in those 36,000 people wouldn't die every year so that's the thing I think we got to keep pushing single payer doesn't cost any more money that's the thing people need to remember and not only the only thing that was left out of tonight's discussion was the effect of income inequality on health care I mean on health outcomes right because the greater the income disparity the worst the health is for the poor people but also for the richer people too the greater the according to a study research shows negative effects of the health on even affluent mainly because researchers contend inequality reduces social cohesion a dynamic that leads to more stress fear and insecurity for everyone so these two things go ahead and if we could get single-payer we would probably reduce some of the income inequality right because people spend so much money on health care and a family of four just to have insurance is up in $29,000 a year according to so uh we you can address both things you're gonna single-payer also addresses income inequality the countries with the greatest income inequality of the worst health comes house outcomes super last thing one of the businessman talked about how Warren Buffett said that the health care costs is the tapeworm in the belly of our economy it's actually hurting our businesses it's not helping them and then another one of the businesswomen there made a great point she said it actually creates an incentive for companies to be more immoral she said if I have to pay my I'm a decent person I pay for my employees health care but the guy next door doesn't pay for their health care says go get medicaid puts it on the taxpayers now they have a competitiveness and of advantage over me because they're more you more than I am because I actually care about my workers I want to make sure that they have health care and that is an insane system we should not have that system and what and then Bernie pointed out we're all subsidizing the Walton family as Walmart I mean because they paid the wages so low they know that they've got to go to Medicaid their workers have to go to Medicaid and we pay for their workers and then they use that to drive mom-and-pop businesses out of business in the middle of America yeah so none of this makes any sense we've got to change the system luckily the answer is really simple we already have Medicare all you gotta do is say now everyone is eligible instead of just people over the age of 65 if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one
