1
00:00:03,127 --> 00:00:03,728
RESISTANCE.

2
00:00:03,728 --> 00:00:06,230
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:09,533
"ANGLE" ."

4
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:10,701
TODAY THE WORLD WATCHED AS

5
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:11,936
DONALD TRUMP MADE GOOD ON HIS

6
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:14,138
PROMISE TO MOVE THE U.S. EMBASSY

7
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:17,508
IN ISRAEL TO JERUSALEM.

8
00:00:17,508 --> 00:00:18,142
THREE PREVIOUS AMERICAN

9
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:21,112
PRESIDENTS HAD PROMISED TO DO

10
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:22,113
THIS.

11
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,514
>> JERUSALEM IS STILL THE

12
00:00:23,514 --> 00:00:24,181
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND MUST

13
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:26,751
REMAIN AN UNDIVIDED CITY

14
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:27,318
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL.

15
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,819
>> AS SOON AS I TAKE OFFICE I

16
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:29,654
WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF MOVING

17
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,856
THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO

18
00:00:31,856 --> 00:00:37,728
THE CITY OF    ISRAEL HAS CHOSEN

19
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:37,762
THE CITY OF    ISRAEL HAS CHOSEI

20
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:38,496
THE CITY OF    ISRAEL HAS CHOSES

21
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:38,829
CAPITAL.

22
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:39,530
>> JERUSALEM WILL REMAIN THE

23
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,799
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND IT MUST

24
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:42,300
REMAIN UNDIVIDED.

25
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,301
>> Laura: BUT ONE FROM

26
00:00:43,301 --> 00:00:46,704
PROMISED, HE ACTUALLY DELIVERED.

27
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:47,938
REMEMBER, CONGRESS PASSED A LAW

28
00:00:47,938 --> 00:00:49,373
AUTHORIZING THE EMBASSY TO MOVE

29
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:52,543
BACK IN 1995, BUT EVERY

30
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:54,612
PRESIDENT HAS DELAYED IT UNTIL

31
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:56,914
NOW.

32
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:58,115
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, THE

33
00:00:58,115 --> 00:00:59,517
PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL,

34
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,951
CELEBRATED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

35
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:02,720
THE MOMENT.

36
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,422
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAME THE

37
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:05,188
FIRST WORLD LEADER TO RECOGNIZE

38
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,958
JERUSALEM AS OUR CAPITAL AND

39
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:11,162
TODAY THE UNITED STATES OF

40
00:01:11,162 --> 00:01:12,330
AMERICA IS OPENING ITS EMBASSY

41
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,367
RIGHT HERE IN JERUSALEM.

42
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:20,204
THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR

43
00:01:20,204 --> 00:01:22,306
HAVING THE COURAGE TO KEEP YOUR

44
00:01:22,306 --> 00:01:24,108
PROMISES.

45
00:01:24,108 --> 00:01:24,709
IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR OUR

46
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,311
FANTASTIC PARTNERSHIP, BUT I

47
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:29,080
BELIEVE IT'S ALSO A GREAT DAY

48
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,447
FOR PEACE.

49
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:33,718
>> Laura: OF COURSE IF ISRAEL

50
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,419
IS JUBILANT AND TRUMP CHALKS UP

51
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:36,454
ANOTHER ACHIEVEMENT, WELL WELL

52
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:41,092
WELL THE MEDIA REFLEXIVELY WHALE

53
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:44,161
AND FAILED POLITICIANS AND

54
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:47,231
DIPLOMATS OF YESTERYEAR GROUSE.

55
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,200
>> IT DOESN'T HELP.

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,369
TO SOME EXTENT IT HURTS, BUT IT

57
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:53,938
EXPOSES A LACK OF A DIPLOMATIC

58
00:01:53,938 --> 00:01:54,772
STRATEGY.

59
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:56,374
I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

60
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:57,708
IS SEEING IT AND UNDERSTANDS

61
00:01:57,708 --> 00:01:58,909
WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE GOING

62
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:01,512
TO BE IF THEY DO ACTUALLY WANT

63
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,714
TO RESTART THE PEACE PROCESS.

64
00:02:03,714 --> 00:02:04,448
>> THIS DECISION WAS ON BOARD

65
00:02:04,448 --> 00:02:08,919
AND ON TETHERED.

66
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,321
PEACE PROCESS IS COMATOSE.

67
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,056
>> IN THE LONG RUN IT WILL NOT

68
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:12,656
ADVANCE PEACE PROCESS.

69
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,759
IT WILL MAKE HIS OWN POLICY MORE

70
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,194
DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE AND

71
00:02:17,194 --> 00:02:17,561
IMPLEMENT.

72
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:21,632
THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE, AND IT

73
00:02:21,632 --> 00:02:26,270
GREATLY INFLAMES AN ALREADY VERY

74
00:02:26,404 --> 00:02:30,341
>> Laura: AS OPPOSED TO WHAT?

75
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:31,008
GEORGE MITCHELL, WHAT YOU

76
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:35,045
NEGOTIATED?

77
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:41,051
LOOK, IF THE OLD GUARD, THE

78
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:41,752
SO-CALLED WISEMAN OF DIPLOMACY

79
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:42,453
KNEW SO MUCH, SUCH SMART GUYS,

80
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,754
WHY ARE WE STILL STRUGGLING IN

81
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:45,222
2018 TO BRING PEACE TO THE

82
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:45,556
REGION?

83
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:47,057
YOU HAD YOUR SHOT AND IT DIDN'T

84
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:47,525
WORK.

85
00:02:47,525 --> 00:02:49,126
AND LET'S FACE IT.

86
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:50,494
NOW IT'S TRUMP'S TURN.

87
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:52,563
SO WHAT THE CRITICS FAILED TO

88
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:53,130
ACKNOWLEDGE IS THAT

89
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,333
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ENGAGED IN AN

90
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,101
INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY THAT IS

91
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:59,737
ALREADY PAYING SOME DIVIDENDS.

92
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,539
HE'S REMAKING ALLIANCES IN THE

93
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:02,773
MIDDLE EAST AND TAKING THE OLD

94
00:03:02,773 --> 00:03:06,177
BARGAINING CHIPS OFF THE TABLE.

95
00:03:06,177 --> 00:03:07,511
HE'S CHANGING THE OLD AND

96
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,245
FRANKLY THE STALE DYNAMIC THAT

97
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,547
WAS IN PLACE.

98
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:12,716
TRUMP IS A REORDERING THE

99
00:03:12,716 --> 00:03:14,852
STATUS QUO AND HE'S FORCING OUR

100
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:16,120
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS INTO NEW

101
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,954
WAYS OF THINKING AND ACTING,

102
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:18,689
EVEN IF IT SEEMS UNCOMFORTABLE.

103
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,293
SAY WHAT YOU WANT, AND A LOT OF

104
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:25,129
YOU DO, ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S

105
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:25,729
APPROACH, BUT HE HAS

106
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,997
REINVIGORATED THE PROSPECTS OF

107
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:28,799
PEACE IN PLACES WE NEVER WOULD

108
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,835
HAVE THOUGHT CHANGE WHATEVER

109
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,202
HAPPENED.

110
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:32,369
AND HE'S CREATED NEW

111
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:32,803
POSSIBILITIES.

112
00:03:32,803 --> 00:03:35,906
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ONLY A

113
00:03:35,906 --> 00:03:37,208
YEAR AGO THAT NORTH KOREA WOULD

114
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,044
BE WILLING TO MELT DOWN ITS

115
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:40,778
NUCLEAR TESTING FACILITIES OR

116
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,179
EVEN COME TO THE NEGOTIATING

117
00:03:42,179 --> 00:03:42,480
TABLE?

118
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,416
NO ONE THOUGHT THAT, EXCEPT

119
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:49,520
MAYBE PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF.

120
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,255
AT HOME, THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING

121
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:53,123
AND THE PRESIDENT IS

122
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,626
DEMONSTRATING THAT BOLD,

123
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:57,161
INNOVATIVE LEADERSHIP CAN GET

124
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,563
REAL RESULTS ABROAD AND AT HOME.

125
00:03:59,563 --> 00:04:00,865
HE'S APPOINTING TOPS ARE NOT

126
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,132
LEGAL MINDS TO THE FEDERAL

127
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:04,134
BENCH, WE KNOW THAT.

128
00:04:04,134 --> 00:04:05,736
HE IS UNTANGLING REGULATIONS

129
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:06,837
THAT CHOKE, STIFLE AMERICAN

130
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:09,707
BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL.

131
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,141
AND NOW HE'S EVEN TACKLING

132
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:11,842
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES.

133
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:12,710
HE DID THAT LAST WEEK AND IS

134
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,746
GOING TO BE WORKING ON THAT.

135
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,113
SO EVEN AS THE MEDIA ARE LOATH

136
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:19,116
TO COVER ANY OF THIS, AT LEAST

137
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:23,320
FAIRLY, THE PUBLIC I THINK GETS

138
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,921
IT.

139
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:26,323
SO TRUMP'S NUMBERS ARE CLIMBING.

140
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:27,591
BUT THE ONLY GROUP OF COURSE

141
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:29,126
THAT HASN'T GOTTEN THE MEMO IS

142
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,194
THE RESISTANCE MEDIA AND THEIR

143
00:04:30,194 --> 00:04:32,930
PALS IN POLITICS.

144
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,031
THEY CONSISTENTLY IGNORE THE

145
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,599
PRESIDENT'S ACHIEVEMENTS WHILE

146
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:38,435
GRASPING AT ANY STRAW TO ASSAIL

147
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:39,970
HIM.

148
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,038
TODAY'S STRAW WAS A SIDE COMMENT

149
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,742
MADE LAST WEEK BY A WHITE HOUSE

150
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,545
AIDE DURING A PRIVATE MEETING

151
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:48,946
ABOUT AILING

152
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:49,480
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN.

153
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,347
>> A WHITE HOUSE AIDE MARKS HIM

154
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:53,384
AND THEY INTERJECT THAT THEY

155
00:04:53,384 --> 00:04:57,488
STAND WITH THE PERSON MOCKING

156
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,356
JOHN McCAIN FOR HAVING BRAIN

157
00:04:59,356 --> 00:04:59,690
CANCER.

158
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,725
>> THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN

159
00:05:01,725 --> 00:05:03,627
APOLOGIES AND IT'S EASY TO

160
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,395
ASSUME THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE

161
00:05:04,395 --> 00:05:06,263
UNITED STATES WAS OKAY WITH THIS

162
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:07,131
BEING SAID.

163
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:08,532
>> SHE HAS STILL NOT PUBLICLY

164
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,167
APOLOGIZED AND SHE IS STILL AN

165
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:12,269
EMPLOYEE HERE AT THE

166
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:13,971
>> THIS SHOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE

167
00:05:13,971 --> 00:05:14,772
CULTURE OF THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

168
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,174
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

169
00:05:17,174 --> 00:05:17,942
POLITICS, LIBERAL, CONSERVATIVE,

170
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,010
REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT.

171
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,047
THAT THERE HAS BEEN A KIND OF

172
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:25,049
INDECENCY THAT HAS BEEN

173
00:05:25,049 --> 00:05:26,951
PERMITTED.

174
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,918
>> Laura: I'M SORRY.

175
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:29,720
I HAD TO BE AWAKEN FROM THAT

176
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,054
MONTAGE.

177
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,823
COME ON.

178
00:05:32,823 --> 00:05:35,626
THE STAFF CALLED McCAIN'S

179
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:36,193
FAMILY PERSONALLY AND

180
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:37,394
APOLOGIZED.

181
00:05:37,394 --> 00:05:39,330
THEY WANT A PUBLIC APOLOGY FOR

182
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,030
WHAT WAS A PRIVATE, LEAKED

183
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,564
COMMENT.

184
00:05:40,564 --> 00:05:43,133
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS THIS

185
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:43,968
AFTERNOON.

186
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,036
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT TEAM OBAMA

187
00:05:46,036 --> 00:05:47,371
SET ABOUT TRUMP AND HIS STAFF,

188
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:49,373
HIS TEAM OR ANY OF HIS

189
00:05:49,373 --> 00:05:51,175
SUPPORTERS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS?

190
00:05:51,175 --> 00:05:53,377
I SHUDDER TO THINK WHAT THEY

191
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:54,144
SAID.

192
00:05:54,144 --> 00:05:57,147
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS REALLY ALL

193
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:57,915
ABOUT.

194
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:00,551
TRYING TO REVIVE THE PRESIDENT'S

195
00:06:00,551 --> 00:06:01,885
COMMENTS ABOUT McCAIN MADE

196
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:02,987
DURING THE CAMPAIGN ABOUT HIM

197
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,922
BEING A P.O.W., WHICH WERE

198
00:06:04,922 --> 00:06:05,889
UNFORTUNATE COMMENTS, BUT TO DO

199
00:06:05,889 --> 00:06:08,325
THAT IN AN EFFORT TO SOMEHOW

200
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,893
HURT TRUMP NOW.

201
00:06:09,893 --> 00:06:11,629
IT DIDN'T WORK THEN AND I DON'T

202
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:12,329
THINK IT WILL WORK NOW.

203
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:16,133
WHILE THE MEDIA AND THEIR

204
00:06:16,133 --> 00:06:18,535
FRIENDS IN POLITICS OBSESS ABOUT

205
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:20,738
THOUGHTLESS COMMENTS AND

206
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:21,939
NONESSENTIALS, A FEW MEMBERS OF

207
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:22,673
THE MEDIA SEEM INTERESTED IN

208
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,708
DOING THEIR ACTUAL JOBS.

209
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:28,379
PURSUING THE STORIES THAT

210
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,147
ACTUALLY TOUCH AND AFFECT OUR

211
00:06:30,147 --> 00:06:30,447
LIVES.

212
00:06:30,447 --> 00:06:31,015
WHAT ABOUT HOLDING OUR

213
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,916
INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE

214
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:33,651
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT

215
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,652
PAY THE BILL.

216
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:38,355
WHY ARE THE MEDIA SO IN CURIOUS

217
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:43,360
ABOUT FBI'S INVESTIGATION OF

218
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,495
HILLARY CLINTON AND COMEY'S

219
00:06:44,495 --> 00:06:47,131
DECISION NOT TO INDICT HER?

220
00:06:47,131 --> 00:06:49,199
WHAT ABOUT THE REPORTS OF

221
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:49,833
PARTISANSHIP IN THE FBI?

222
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,235
POSSIBLE CORRUPTION WITHIN THE

223
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:53,737
MUELLER PRO.

224
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:55,072
WHERE IS THE REPORTING ON DEVIN

225
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,940
NUNES ATTEMPT TO GET THE JUSTICE

226
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,509
DEPARTMENT TO HAND OVER

227
00:06:58,509 --> 00:06:59,576
DOCUMENTS EXPLAINING HOW THE

228
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:02,746
FBI'S RUSSIAN COLLUSION PROBE

229
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:03,847
STARTED AND WHO ACTUALLY STARTED

230
00:07:03,847 --> 00:07:04,348
AT?

231
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:06,116
HE HAD TO THREATEN ROD

232
00:07:06,116 --> 00:07:06,784
ROSENSTEIN WITH IMPEACHMENT

233
00:07:06,784 --> 00:07:09,119
BASICALLY TO GET A RESPONSE.

234
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,187
AND HE STILL HASN'T SEEN ALL THE

235
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:14,158
DOCUMENTS IN QUESTION.

236
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:15,426
ISN'T THAT WORTH INVESTIGATING?

237
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:16,126
PUT TRUMP ASIDE AND WHAT YOU

238
00:07:16,126 --> 00:07:18,462
THINK ABOUT HIM ASIDE.

239
00:07:18,462 --> 00:07:21,932
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND THE

240
00:07:21,932 --> 00:07:23,367
FBI STONEWALLING THOSE WITH

241
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:29,406
ACTUAL OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY.

242
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:32,142
OR HAVE PORN STARS AND RUSSIAN

243
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:32,910
COLLUSION CONSPIRACY THEORIES

244
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,545
SAPPED ALL THE MEDIA'S MANPOWER

245
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:36,914
AND ALL OF THEIR ENERGY AND

246
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,148
RESOURCES?

247
00:07:38,148 --> 00:07:39,650
IF THE PRESS, THINK ABOUT THIS,

248
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:40,918
SPENT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

249
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,922
COVERING SOME OF THOSE STORIES,

250
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,157
IT MAY BE MORE AMERICANS MIGHT

251
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:47,791
LISTEN WHEN THEY REPORTED

252
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,827
CRITICALLY ON THE PRESIDENT.

253
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:51,995
BUT SO LONG AS THE PRESS IS JUST

254
00:07:51,995 --> 00:07:53,931
A WING OF THE RESISTANCE, THEIR

255
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,936
AUDIENCE WILL SCATTER, IT WILL

256
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,703
DWINDLE AND SOON MOST OF AMERICA

257
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:02,005
WILL JUST TUNE THEM OUT.

258
00:08:02,005 --> 00:08:05,409
SO GO AHEAD AND COVER CRITICISM

259
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:06,777
OF THE PRESIDENT BUT ONCE IN A

260
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:07,745
WHILE JUST TRY BALANCING OUT

261
00:08:07,745 --> 00:08:09,346
WHAT SOME HONEST COVERAGE OF

262
00:08:09,346 --> 00:08:11,448
SOME OF THE GROUNDBREAKING

263
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:13,350
SUCCESSES IN THE REAL

264
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,251
ACHIEVEMENTS.

265
00:08:14,251 --> 00:08:14,952
WE ALL NEED THE PRESS TO HOLD

266
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,355
EVERYONE ACCOUNTABLE.

267
00:08:18,355 --> 00:00:00,000
TRUMP SURELY, BUT ALSO THE OTHER
