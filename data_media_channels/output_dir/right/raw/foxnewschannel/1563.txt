00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:49,082
STATES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

67
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,617

69
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:54,188
BAD IT IS GETTING, AT THIS TIME

70
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:56,423

71
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:57,024

NOW IT IS UP TO 26.

73
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,662
LAST YEAR IT CAPPED OUT AT 35.

74
00:02:01,662 --> 00:02:03,864
SADLY LOOKS LIKE WE'LL GET WAY

75
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:07,367
PAST THAT BEFORE THE SUMMER

76
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:07,701
STARTS.

77
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:09,136
YOU WONDER IF THIS IS AN

78
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:10,270
ATTITUDE IN AMERICA TODAY?

79
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,339
>> YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOU,

80
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:12,639
BRIAN.

81
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,807
I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING THERE

82
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:14,341
TO THAT.

83
00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:16,476
I KNOW THERE IS A GENERAL LACK

84
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:19,479
OF RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER AND

85
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,714
AUTHORITY AND MAKING SURE THAT

86
00:02:20,714 --> 00:02:24,151
WE ALL LIVE NICELY AND IN

87
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:25,118
HARMONY WITH EVERYBODY BUT AT

88
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:26,587
THE SAME TIME WITH LAW

89
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:29,423
ENFORCEMENT I THINK IT IS TRENDY

90
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,691
TO HATE COPS RIGHT NOW.

91
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:32,025
I HONESTLY DO.

92
00:02:32,025 --> 00:02:33,560
I THINK IT IS TRENDY TO HATE

93
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,763
COPS AND TRENDY TO BASH COPS.

94
00:02:36,763 --> 00:02:39,466
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS EASY

95
00:02:39,466 --> 00:02:41,201
TO SUNDAY MORNING QUARTER A

96
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,103
COP'S DECISION THROUGH THE

97
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:44,471
KEYBOARD IN PARTICULAR THEY

DON'T HAVE ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT

99
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:47,608
TRAINING.

100
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:48,942
>> GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, GREG

101
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:50,510
ABBOTT WILL HOLD A ROUNDTABLE

102
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,845
DISCUSSION, THREE DAYS OF

103
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:54,414
ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSIONS TO SPEED

104
00:02:54,414 --> 00:02:56,049
UP SECURITY IN STATE.

105
00:02:56,049 --> 00:02:58,719
KEEP GUNS AWAY FROM THOSE WHO

106
00:02:58,719 --> 00:02:59,953
POSE IMMEDIATE DANGER.

107
00:02:59,953 --> 00:03:01,488
HE WANTS MORE RESOURCES FOR

108
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:02,990
SCHOOL SAFETY PERSONNEL, AND HE

109
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,592
WANTS TO ADDRESS MENTAL ILLNESS

110
00:03:05,592 --> 00:03:07,294
ISSUES TIEDED TO GUN VIOLENCE.

111
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:09,396
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS, DANA?

112
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,131
>> AINSLEY, THESE ARE ALL ISSUES

113
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:12,499
I HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOR' HAVE,

114
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:15,402
VERY LONG TIME, SINCE THE NOW

115
00:03:15,402 --> 00:03:17,471
INFAMOUS TOWN HALL WHEN THOSE

116
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:18,805
SUGGESTIONS WERE ROUNDLY BOOED.

117
00:03:18,805 --> 00:03:19,806
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE

118
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:20,607
SCHOOL SHIELD PROGRAM.

119
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,276
I HOPE THAT SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

120
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:25,512
COUNTRY REALIZE THAT THESE

121
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:26,413
RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM.

122
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:29,149
IF I CAN MAKE ONE QUICK POINT.

123
00:03:29,149 --> 00:03:31,051
EVERY ONE WHO HAS CHILDREN IN

124
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:32,386
SCHOOLS NEED TO REALIZE RIGHT

125
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:32,653
NOW.

126
00:03:32,653 --> 00:03:34,254
THEY NEED TO REALIZE THIS

127
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:35,656
HAPPENED IN BROWARD COUNTY.

128
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:37,524
I TALKED TO PEOPLE IN BROWARD

129
00:03:37,524 --> 00:03:39,926
COUNTY AT MARJORY STONEMAN

130
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:40,560
DOUGLAS SCHOOL.

131
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,930
THEY HAD A SECRET SERVICE MEMBER

132
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,499
DO RISK AS SENTIMENT.

133
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:46,566
NONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE PUT

134
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,200
INTO PLACE.

135
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,202
A PROMISED PROGRAM THAT DIDN'T

136
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:50,504
REPORT CRIMINALITY OF STUDENTS

137
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:51,772
AND PREVENT AD RECORD FROM BEING

138
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,206
ESTABLISHED FOR THE MURDERER.

139
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:56,610
HE COULD HAVE BEEN RENDERED A

140
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,613
PROHIBITED POSSESSOR.

141
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:01,048
PARENTS NEED TO MAKE SURE THESE

142
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,817
PROGRAMS ARE NOW IN THEIR KIDS

143
00:04:03,817 --> 00:04:04,184
SCHOOLS.

144
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,153
HOW ABOUT TAKE HALF A BILLION

145
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:07,254
DOLLARS PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND

146
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:08,989
REDIRECT THAT TO MAKE SURE

147
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,524
SCHOOLS ARE SECURED AND ARMED

148
00:04:10,524 --> 00:04:12,225
SECURITY AND METAL DETECTORS.

149
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:14,394
WE PROTECT OUR SPORTING EVENTS

150
00:04:14,394 --> 00:04:15,829
AND CONCERTS MORE.

151
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:17,831
STEVE: AS AN NRA SPOKESPERSON

152
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:18,798
OVER THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS

153
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:19,933
WE'VE BEEN HEARING MORE AND

154
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:21,500
MORE, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT OF

155
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,803
THE UNITED STATES TALKING ABOUT

156
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:24,304
WE SHOULD BE ARMING OUR

157
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:24,671
TEACHERS.

158
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,206
IN FACT THAT IS ONE OF THE

159
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:27,674
THINGS THAT GREG ABBOTT IS GOING

160
00:04:27,674 --> 00:04:29,276
TO BE TALKING ABOUT, GOVERNOR

161
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:31,144
ABBOTT THERE IN YOUR STATE

162
00:04:31,144 --> 00:04:31,445
TODAY.

163
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:32,145
>> YES.

164
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:34,948
AND I THINK IF TEACHERS AND

165
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:35,816
PARENTS DETERMINE FOR THEIR,

166
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:36,983
EACH FOR THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT

167
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:38,051
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY

168
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:41,288
BAN TO IMPLEMENT AND TEACHERS

169
00:04:41,288 --> 00:04:42,255
VOLUNTEERED, THEY'RE WILLING TO

170
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:43,824
TRAIN AND WILLING TO CARRY --

171
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:45,359
TEACH REMEMBERS INCREDIBLY

172
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:45,992
TALENTED PEOPLE.

173
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:47,361
I DON'T THINK THEY GET THE

174
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,495
CREDIT THEY DESERVE.

175
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:49,896
THEY CAN TEACH THEIR STUDENTS

176
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:52,265
AND DEFEND THEIR OWN LIVES.

177
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:54,301
IF HEAVEN FORBIDS ALL ELSE

178
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:55,602
FAILS, DEFEND THE LIVES OF

179
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:57,070
STUDENTS IF WE HAVE ARMED

180
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,872
RESOURCE OFFICERS, DO WHAT DAN

181
00:04:58,872 --> 00:05:00,741
PATRICK WAS DISCUSSING MAKE SURE

182
00:05:00,741 --> 00:05:02,576
WE'RE WATCHING ACCESS POINTS AND

183
00:05:02,576 --> 00:05:03,577
EXIT POINTS.

184
00:05:03,577 --> 00:05:05,612
THAT OUR SCHOOLS, PERIMETERS ARE

185
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:06,580
SAFE, DOUBLE LOCKING DOORS.

186
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,615
THIS IS MULTILAYER THING.

187
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:09,950
NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE REALIZE

188
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,250
THAT.

189
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,351
THAT IS WHAT PATRICK IS

190
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:12,152
DISCUSSING.

191
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:13,854
THAT IS WHAT GREG ABBOTT IS

192
