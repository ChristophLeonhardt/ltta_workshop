1
00:00:02,857 --> 00:00:04,692
TIMES AS MANY ACCORDING TO OUR

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:05,359
CALCULATIONS AS LAST YEAR.

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,561
THE CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS THE

4
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,663
REVIEW SHOULD BE COMPLETE IN

5
00:00:09,663 --> 00:00:10,164
ABOUT TWO WEEKS.

6
00:00:10,164 --> 00:00:12,500
NEW REACTION COMING IN AROUND

7
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,234
THE WORLD AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP

8
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,169
SET THE UNITED STATES IS PULLING

9
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:18,472
OUT OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL.

10
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:19,673
RICH EDSON IS TRACKING OF

11
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:20,674
ELEMENTS FROM THE

12
00:00:20,674 --> 00:00:21,175
STATE DEPARTMENT.

13
00:00:21,175 --> 00:00:24,478
IT SOUNDS, RICH, FROM THE LATEST

14
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:25,846
DISPATCHES FROM TEHRAN THAT THE

15
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:27,948
IRANIANS ARE TAKING A HARD LINE

16
00:00:27,948 --> 00:00:28,682
ON THIS.

17
00:00:28,682 --> 00:00:30,684
>> THEY CERTAINLY ARE AND THE

18
00:00:30,684 --> 00:00:31,352
SPECIFIC FALLOUT IS HOW THE

19
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:33,220
UNITED STATES WILL BE

20
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:35,990
RE-IMPOSING SANCTIONS AND WHO

21
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:37,491
THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO

22
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,559
SANCTION AS A RESULT OF ALL

23
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,093
THIS.

24
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:40,494
WE ARE STILL WORKING ALL THAT

25
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:42,163
OUT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

26
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:44,098
WHAT EXACTLY IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

27
00:00:44,098 --> 00:00:45,266
FOR THE GENERAL RULE, THE

28
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:49,370
COUNTRIES THAT ARE PART OF THE

29
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,338
IRAN-NUCLEAR DEAL, THEY WANT THE

30
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:53,507
UNITED STATES TO STAY IN US.

31
00:00:53,507 --> 00:00:56,243
THEY WERE NEGOTIATING AND THAT

32
00:00:56,243 --> 00:00:58,279
THEY JUST RELEASED A STATEMENT

33
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:58,646
CALLED E3.

34
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:02,116
AFTER ENGAGING WITH THE U.S.

35
00:01:02,116 --> 00:01:02,883
ADMINISTRATION AND A THOROUGH

36
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:03,784
MANNER IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS,

37
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:05,486
WE CALL ON THE U.S. TO DO

38
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:06,253
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO PRESERVE

39
00:01:06,253 --> 00:01:11,058
THE GAINS FOR NONNUCLEAR

40
00:01:11,058 --> 00:01:11,892
PROLIFERATION BACK ALLOWING

41
00:01:11,892 --> 00:01:13,561
CONTINUED ENFORCEMENT OF ITS

42
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:14,295
MAIN ELEMENT.

43
00:01:14,295 --> 00:01:15,296
THAT'S STILL UNCLEAR.

44
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:16,530
THE OTHER TWO COUNTRIES THAT ARE

45
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,799
PART OF THIS, CHINA AND RUSSIA,

46
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,500
THEY ARE PUSHING THE U.S. TO

47
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,570
STAY IN AND THEY ARE NOW TALKING

48
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,271
AND EXPRESSING THE SAME

49
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:25,272
DISAPPOINTMENT.

50
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:26,807
THE GULF COUNTRIES INCLUDING

51
00:01:26,807 --> 00:01:28,475
ISRAEL AND SAUDI ARABIA, FOR

52
00:01:28,475 --> 00:01:29,210
EXAMPLE, THEY NEVER LIKED THIS

53
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,312
DEAL AND WANT OF THE U.S. OUT OF

54
00:01:31,312 --> 00:01:32,112
IT.

55
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:33,380
THE SAUDIS ARE SAYING THEY

56
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,883
SUPPORT THE U.S. DECISION AS

57
00:01:35,883 --> 00:01:39,286
WELL AS BENJAMIN NETANYAHU.

58
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,288
>> ISRAEL FULLY SUPPORTS

59
00:01:41,288 --> 00:01:42,623
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BOLD DECISION

60
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:44,658
TO REJECT THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH

61
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:46,594
THE TERRORISTS REGIME IN TEHRAN.

62
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:48,295
ISRAEL HAS OPPOSED THE NUCLEAR

63
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:50,264
DEAL FROM THE START, BECAUSE WE

64
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:56,503
SAID THAT, RATHER THAN BLOCKING

65
00:01:56,503 --> 00:01:58,272
IRAN'S PATH TO THE BOMB, IT

66
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,574
ACTUALLY PAVES THE PATH TO THE

67
00:02:00,574 --> 00:02:01,242
NUCLEAR BOMBS WITHIN A FEW

68
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:03,277
YEARS' TIME.

69
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:05,512
>> Shepard: HE ADDED THAT THE

70
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:07,581
DECISION WAS BOTH BRAVE AND

71
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:10,317
CORRECT, >> .

72
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:13,087
>> Shepard: BUT WHAT WILL STOP

73
00:02:13,087 --> 00:02:15,222
THE IRANIANS FROM ENRICHING

74
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:15,522
AGAIN?

75
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:16,790
>> YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT OF

76
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:20,194
WHAT THE U.S. REACTION WAS TO

77
00:02:20,194 --> 00:02:24,665
THAT DURING MIKE POMPEI UP HER

78
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:26,901
>> 'S.

79
00:02:26,901 --> 00:02:27,668
>> STATEMENT.

80
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:28,869
THAT'S A QUESTION THE EUROPEANS

81
00:02:28,869 --> 00:02:29,270
ARE ASKING.

82
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:31,705
NOW THAT YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION

83
00:02:31,705 --> 00:02:33,307
WHERE THERE IS A STRONG

84
00:02:33,307 --> 00:02:35,276
INSPECTION REGIME, BECAUSE OF

85
00:02:35,276 --> 00:02:37,411
THE JCPOA, DOES IRAN NO LONGER

86
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,113
LET THOSE INSPECTORS INSIDE OF

87
00:02:39,113 --> 00:02:39,713
THE COUNTRY BECAUSE THE

88
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:41,715
UNITED STATES IS DESIGNED TO

89
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:42,516
REIMPOSE SECTIONS?

90
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:43,517
THAT'S WHY THE EUROPEAN

91
00:02:43,517 --> 00:02:44,518
GOVERNMENTS IN CHINA AND RUSSIA

92
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:45,686
ARE TRYING TO HOLD THIS

93
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,655
AGREEMENT TOGETHER, THEY TRY TO

94
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:50,090
DO SO WITHOUT THE UNITED STATES.

95
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,525
BUT IRAN NOW HAS WHAT IT

96
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,494
BELIEVES IS A REASON TO WALK

97
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:55,496
AWAY FROM THIS, BECAUSE THE

98
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:56,630
UNITED STATES IS IT'S GOING TO

99
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,931
DO SO.

100
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:58,966
>> Shepard: TO BE CLEAR, THE

101
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,734
IRANIAN PRESIDENT HAS JUST SAID

102
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:03,270
THAT THE TALKS WITH THESE OTHER

103
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,072
NATIONS, ALL THESE WHO WERE

104
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:06,840
PARTY TO THE DEAL WILL COMMENCE.

105
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,877
ALONG WITH THE RUSSIANS AND THE

106
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:10,911
CHINESE, AND IF, IN FACT, THERE

107
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:13,113
IS NOT A WAY TO MAINTAIN THIS

108
00:03:13,113 --> 00:03:15,282
DEAL WITH THESE PARTIES, THE

109
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,283
IRANIANS WILL THEN BEGIN

110
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:17,084
ENRICHING URANIUM AGAIN AT A

111
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:21,088
LEVEL LARGER THAN BEFORE.

112
00:03:21,088 --> 00:00:00,000
AND IF THE IRANIANS DO THAT,
