scandal that's not really a scandal but is at least worth talking about because it does say something about the left's perspective and hollywood's perspective on america it is as they say one of the reasons President Trump is president this particular scandal comes courtesy of Damien Chazelle now this makes me sad because Damien Chazelle is one of the best directors working today he did whiplash and then he did lala land and his new movie looks great it's a biopic titled first man about Neil Armstrong who's the first man to walk on moon and the stars Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong but there's one problem the movie apparently omits the American flag why is that big deal you say because at the most crucial moment the picture that everyone cares about from the actual moon landing is Neil Armstrong racing the American flag on the moon this is sort of like doing a movie about the Battle of Iwo Jima and not having the guys raise an American flag instead they just decided to raise an empty flagpole with like an emoji sticker on it or something right it makes no sense at all it's an iconic moment in American history but Ryan Gosling who is Canadian says that he thinks that Neil Armstrong saw himself more as a world citizen than as an American hero which makes no sense at all he says I think this was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement and that's how we chose to view it well not by Americans it wasn't not by Americans it turns out that when America was putting a man on the moon in China which is the real reason why they're not putting the American flag in this film is because they're afraid that it'll piss off the Chinese censors and they want to make sure that the Chinese market goes to see the film so they've removed the American flag it's the same reason that long ago when they made Superman Returns they omitted truth justice in the American Way they turn it into truth justice and all that other stuff the Hollywood is really really afraid of taking off foreign audiences with all of the America there's only one problem with that logic which is that nobody in foreign countries actually cares whether American films promote America because it turns out America's a pretty frickin amazing place like we put a man on the moon that's one of the pieces of proof actually so Ryan Gosling Canadian says I also think Neil was extremely humble as were many of these astronauts and time and time again he deferred the focus from himself to the 400,000 people who made the mission possible those 400,000 people would have been Americans by the way who worked for the American government he was running everyone that he was just the tip of the iceberg and that's not just to be humble that's also true so I don't think Neil viewed himself as an American hero for my interviews with his family and people that knew him it was quite the opposite and we wanted the film to reflect Neil alternatively Hollywood is just catering to foreign audiences and so they're going to omit the American flag in a blatant attempt to grab Chinese money but let's be clear putting a man on the moon was an American mission it was not a world mission it was an American mission JFK who announced the original missions put a man on the moon when he did this when he talked about why we would put a man on the moon he explicitly linked it to America's special rule in the world as a provider of freedom remember this is the middle of the Cold War and there was a lot of talk in those days like right about this time about the Russians putting a man into space on the Sputnik satellite and JFK decided okay we're gonna fight back against that by actually going far beyond that we'll put a man on the moon putting an American flag on the moon was the point of the endeavor it wasn't ancillary to the endeavor it was actually point of the endeavor here's Jeff K talking about the original mission we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills okay and then he explicitly links the mission to guess what the American flag here's what he had to say about the American flag in announcing this mission he's talking about this at Rice University's very famous speech obviously well the eyes of the world now look into space to the moon and to the planets beyond and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest but by a banner of freedom and please so it turns out that the American flag was sort of the point right we didn't want the Russians to be up there on the moon using it as a base we didn't want the Chinese up there by the way at the time that we were actually throwing ticker-tape parades for Neil Armstrong the Chinese were busy stringing up people who were dissenting from government policy so the fact that we are now catering to a Chinese government that remains a fascistic dictatorship the fact that we are catering to that government in order to downplay the role of America it has a lot to say with with the nature of free markets free markets are not by nature moral when it comes to who they take into account markets are moral only in the sense that they recognize that our property is the fruit of our labor that's what makes markets moral but there's nothing that says a free market is more when it comes to which audience you are catering to and if Hollywood feels you can cater to a Chinese market by getting rid of American messaging it will do so despite the immorality of that basic idea but there's something deeper happening here and that is that Hollywood in the American left are deeply embarrassed by the idea that America is a nation that is a force for good in the world there's a hard core of the left that believes that America historically it's the Howard Zinn left believes that America is historically a force for evil in the world if you go listen to the radicals over like chapo traphouse or something another podcast on the Left what you will see is that they're constantly talking about historically how America has been a force for tyranny and fascism around the world and maybe it would be better if America had just backed off the world stage and allowed the Soviets and the Communists to dominate Africa dominate South America it's all about America backing to your it's the no I'm Chomsky view of history and that is being indicated here every good thing America did is actually a whirl of achievement and every bad thing America did is America's burden alone so slavery was America's alone of putting a man on the moon that was a world achievement in reality it's sort of the reverse slavery was a universal in human history America fought a bloody war to get rid of slavery that does not mean that folks who engaged in slavery and back slavery in the United States are off the moral hook far from it but what is uniquely American is not slavery that was a universal world institution that was also enacted in the United States and was evil but what is uniquely American is what we did after slavery and the foundations of the country in the Constitution there are certain things that are unique about America the left reverses all of these historical truths everything that is bad about America in reality the vast majority of things that have been bad about America were not unique to America they were rather Universal and most of the things that are good about America tend to be pretty unique to America and not universal which is why America's Rises coincident with the greatest reduction in world poverty in the history of mankind why America's rise in terms of economic power is coincident with the dramatic decrease in child death in in health problems even in pollution and in the last 20 years America's been reducing its own pollution by leaps and bounds the fact is America is a uniquely wonderful place and the fact and and because Hollywood doesn't choose to recognize that they will remove any indicator than anything good that was ever done under American auspices was done under the auspices of that American flag they will champion people kneeling for the American flag with regard to isolated instances of police misconduct but they won't put the American flag on the moon it's more representative of the American flag when there's a bad cop than it is of the American flag when we legitimately expend billions of dollars to put a human being on the moon and put the American flag up there that's insanity but unfortunately that's a pretty prevalent view among a lot of folks on the radical left and I would say even on the mainstream left now meanwhile I think it's important to point out some news regarding some of the beloved candidates of the of the Democratic Party and the left one of the candidates who is rising fast in the polls is beta O'Rourke beta O'Rourke is running against Ted Cruz for the Senate in Texas and the polls having him pretty close I mean in spitting distance some polls have them within the margin of error Democrats are of course extraordinarily excited about that's if they could turn Texas blue if then they'd never lose another election I mean basically once Texas goes below the country goes blue Texas is certainly a bellwether state and what you saw in the last election it was actually very interesting is that while President Trump turned Ohio red and he turned Florida red and Wisconsin red and while he turned Michigan red Texas was trending more blue he actually he actually won Texas by fewer points I believe than Mitt Romney won Texas in 2012 I'm not mistaken in any case bado Eric was expected to be far behind Ted Cruz in the Texas race turnout is gonna be very high on the Democratic side and I think Cruz's camp is is worried about our work in a way that is pretty shocked and given the fact that Texas is a deep red state it is not a blue state in the proof is in the pudding Republicans dominate the state legislature they dominate the governor's office they have four years beta work those being held up as the new face of the Democratic Party should bethe own work win the Senate seat in Texas there's very little doubt that he would be the frontrunner for the presidential nomination in 2020 from the Democratic side of the aisle he is a pretty good speaker there they're trying to paint him as a sort of Obama like figure that he came out of nowhere and therefore he is he is somebody who ought to be with a formidable resume but apparently his campaign has now run into a bit of a speed bump the speed bump being that he was involved in a DUI 20 years ago and actually apparently tried to flee the scene of the crime this is according to the Houston Chronicle US Representative beta O'Rourke has long owned up to his drunken driving arrests 20 years ago describing it in a Houston Chronicle op-ed piece earlier this week as a serious mistake for which there is no excuse although the arrest has been public knowledge police reports of the September 1998 incident when the Democratic Senate candidate had just turned 26 shows more serious threat to public safety than has previously been reported state and local police reports obtained by the Chronicle and Express news show work was driving drunk and what a witness called a high rate of speed in a 75 mile per hour zone on Interstate 10 about a mile from the New Mexico border he lost control and hit a truck sending his car careening across the center median into oncoming lanes the witness who stopped at the scene later told police that her work had tried to drive away from the scene so he's involved in a DUI allegedly a DUI hit-and-run after crossing into oncoming traffic O'Rourke blew a 0.1 36 and 0.134 on police breathalyzers which means that bass that he was made of alcohol at that point that is not a mild drunk driving arrest that is you have been drinking incessantly for hours and then you get in a car and rush into oncoming traffic then try to flee the scene this is well above the legal limit the legal limit in Texas is point zero eight so he's driving most twice the legal limit he's arrested at the scene charged with DUI completed a court approved diversion program and had the charges dismissed now listen as somebody who's had their license suspended for speeding I've never driven drunk I have had my license suspended I would say that there is a major difference between a speeding ticket or even a DUI where you're pulled over and you and you blow above the legal limit and you rushing into oncoming traffic hitting and hitting other cars and then trying to flee that's that's a significant amount worse so bitter erupts candidacy could be in trouble we'll talk about that plus another Democratic candidate who could be in trouble for even more insane reasons in just one second

trouble in his Texas race to the great consternation of Democrats that's not even the craziest Democrat story of the day the craziest Democrat story of the day comes courtesy of Senate candidate Julia Salazar so Julia Salazar was running for the state Senate in New York and she is according to city and state New York she has attracted significant often fawning media coverage an army of enthusiastic volunteers endorsements from politicians and activist organizations and now withering scrutiny a series of articles have dug into her childhood religion and activist history exposing facts that either contradict or provide relevant context to some of her biographical claims based on interviews with her mother and brother and Salazar herself city and state has discovered additional previously unreported instances of Salazar falsely presenting her background and others that are well not technically untrue misleading but the deeper one digs into the competing narratives of Salazar's upbringing the less it appears to be a simple matter of truth or lies or he-said she-said Salazar has told the few outright falsehoods she claimed her family emigrated from Colombia when in reality she her brother and mother were born and raised in the United States and her father first came to the United States as a teenager and was naturalized before Salazar was ever born and she also claimed that she had Jewish background she has no Jewish background at all but she's anti-israel she wanted to claim that she was Jewish that she could get away with the anti-israel nonsense she also claimed that she grew up working class in an economically stressed family it turns out that is not true according to her brother my family emigrated to the u.s. from cologne so she said my family immigrated to the u.s. from Colombia when I was a baby my mom ended up raising my brother and me as a single mom without a college degree and from a working-class background that's what she told Jacobin magazine the socialist magazine her brother says he remembers them being financially comfortable living in a big house along a river in Jupiter Florida each of the siblings had their own rooms the six-figure income their father Luis Hernandez are owned as a pilot meant the family could afford to set aside college saving funds of about $6,000 for each child he says we were very much middle-class we had a house in Jupiter along the river it was in a beautiful neighborhood I feel very strongly about my family and I want to tell the truth so all of this is basically a lie so that's pretty awesome so that I like that every but she recently said we didn't she she also claimed that she didn't have permanent residence in the United States that is not true everyone in her family was a US citizen because her father became a US citizen sometime around 1984 so all sorts of good stuff from Julia Salazar and she is she's kind of a crazy person it sounds like but the Democrats are defending because obviously she fulfills certain intersectional boxes and that's of course why they're defending bata or work as well because those intersectional boxes matter a lot more than being qualified to actually be a legislator in the United States the Democrats are much more interested in this sort of intersectional racial politics than they are in anything else and this is a broader trend in American politics right now what's it's it's very weird what's happening American politics on the left you have people jumping into a sort of left wing populism that is wrapped around identity politics so populism to describe what populism is in sort of policy context is difficult because populism is more a tactic than it is natural policy populism is when people say I speak for the people that's populism when people say I speak for a policy that's usually not populism but if you had to sort of peg down the populist attitude toward policy it's usually distrust of major institutions and so jamie curott puts it and i think this is right distrust of major institutions so sort of conspiracy theorizing about the power of institutions and in life belief that your identity group is paramount and distrust of the markets those would be sort of the three big things you just trust the free market because you think the fruit the free market is rigged you just trust institutions like the government and you believe that your identity group is paramount well what's weird is that both left and right have now embraced a lot of these particular principles on the right this manifest has anti-immigrant attitude at a belief that we have to maintain you know in quote-unquote white majority there are parts of the right that have actually argued this that the real problem with with immigration is not people immigrating from cultures that may not be well assimilated in the United States but it's actually the countries that the people themselves coming from countries that we don't like right that's that's a bad attitude and it's and that that's sort of right-wing populism with regard to immigration on the Left it's actually manifested as the out-group is white Americans in many case in the in-group is minority citizens who have been put under the thumb anti institutions on the right you see this as everything that the the deep state right everything the government does is conspiratorial and an attempt to get you and well I am on board with a lot of suspicion of government intervention ISM the economy I have real doubts that the government is a malevolent force in American life I think it's much more to do with radical incompetence and stupidity because most people are radically incompetent and stupid then it had to do with conspiracy theories inside the government and on the right the anti-free market attitude which we'll talk about in a second has taken the form of big corporations are backing the leftist agenda so we'll talk about all those three from the right on the Left these three attitudes manifest in a different way so the in-group loyalty is loyalty to this idea of a majority minority country that that's very important we have to push that and we have to say that the future of America is non-white you see this in an article in The New York Times today the the anti free markets attitude is evidence on the left in virtually every respect and then you have the distrust of institutions which is America is systemically racist America's institutionally biased and all the rest and so there's this meeting of the minds when it comes to distrust of institutions distrust of the markets and belief that the in-group is paramount so let's talk about I think that the populism of the right has in large part been driven by the populism of the left I think that a lot of the populism of the right is a reactionary response to the populism of the left particularly on issues racial so I mentioned Julia Salazar I mentioned also bata O'Rourke obviously a lot of the enthusiasm for Andrew Gilliam in Florida has to do with the fact that he's black not just the fact that he is a Democratic Socialist by the way I mentioned quick correction yesterday I suggested he was gay because it's just a mistake he's not gay he has a wife in any case the the intersectional politics of the left is very evident and the proof today comes courtesy of the New York Times there are two separate pieces in the New York Times talking about the threat of whiteness in America and why it would be good if there was a white minority in America there's the identity politics populism of the left that has led them to embrace a bunch of radical candidates on their own side there's a piece by Thomas Edsel talking about demography in the United States and the fact that the there are a lot of people he's very against this he's there's a lot of people who are Hispanic who now identify as white now normally we would think okay that maybe that's a fine thing like how you self-identified racially that maybe that's an indicator that you feel comfortable in the United States if there's this line that's being put out by the by the press that America is a whites-only country and that whites are comfortable in America and then you started self-identifying as well maybe that isn't you being a race trader maybe that's you basically saying I don't care about my race anymore I'm just going to identify as what the media would identify me as because I'm successful the reality is I think that our focus on race in the country is extraordinarily over-the-top in the most tolerant in the first country in human history but this article by Edsel in the New York Times suggests that it's really bad that people are self identifying as white instead we should cuddle them back into particular racial groups so that we can have this majority minority America and then identify voters by their particular strain of race this is this something Edsel is pushing over at the New York Times that's not the only calm there's a piece in The New York Times today that's even worse which I'm gonna get to in just a second but first let's talk about your sleep quality so you have a mattress is that mattress made for you to just go to a mattress store you lay on it for like ten seconds then you bought it and now you're really uncomfortable you're not sleeping all that well this is why you instead I ought to go to helix sleep calm or they go tailor a mattress to you helix sleep calm has a two-minute sleep quiz and it will

sister for her wedding she loves it as well go check it out right now helix sleep calm slash Ben helix sleep calm slash Ben for 125 bucks off your mattress or to use that slash Ben so that they know that we sent you okay so the left populism on race takes the form of identity politics there's a piece by a person named Pankaj Mishra is a contributing opinion writer focused on ideas and politics of the neuro Times the title is the religion of whiteness becomes a suicide cult and the basic idea is that everything she disagrees with his whiteness everything she doesn't like his whiteness because white men are bad and whiteness is bad and what would be better is if we were ruled by an intersectional coalition of people who have been victimized in the past by American whiteness so this is what this idiot writes putting Pankaj Mishra whose representative of serious strain of thought in the left-wing community white men an obscure Australian academic named Charles Henry Pearson predicted in his eighth 93 book national life and character a forecast would be elbowed and hustled and perhaps even thrust aside by people they had long regarded as their inferiors black and yellow races China in particular would be a major threat Pearson prone to terrors of racial extinction while living in a settler colony in an Asian neighborhood thought it was imperative to defend the last part of the world in which the higher races can live an increase freely for the higher civilization his prescriptions for racial self-defense thunderously echoed around the white Anglo sphere the community of men with shared historical ties to Britain Theodore Roosevelt who held a complacent 19th century faith buttress by racist pseudoscience that non white people's were hopelessly inferior reported to Pearson the great effect of his book among all our men here in Washington in the years that followed politicians and pundits in Britain and in settler colonies of Australia Canada and the United States will jointly forge an identity geopolitics of the higher races today it has written so you're saying what is 1893 have to do with like 2018 it's 121 125 years later what is the why well let let Pankaj Mishra explain today this ideology has reached its final and most desperate phase with existential fears about endangered white power feverishly circulating once again between the core and the periphery of the greatest modern Empire the fundamentalists question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive president from said last year in a speech hailed by the British journalist Douglas Murray the Canadian columnist mark Stein and the American editor rich Lowry more recently mr. Trump tweeted falsely about large-scale killing of white farmers in South Africa a preoccupy preoccupation deepened by Rupert Murdoch's media of white supremacists around the world so in other words because Trump said that the West may be losing its will to survive that is an indicator of white supremacy but the West is a unique thing in human history and it is not because of race is actually because of not caring about race the West was shaped by a couple of cultural forces judeo-christian values and Greek reason none of them are exclusive to race I mean Augustine was was from North Africa and the idea that that everybody who is a part of Western civilization was of one race even there were there were legitimate racial battles between like Italians and between the Irish and the British it's only now that we consider whiteness a thing and that is largely yes due to racism of whites but now it's being re kind of vivified by this idea of the left that whiteness is the prevailing culturally dominant hierarchy and we have to get rid of it and so in this article this is the part that's amazing this are this author basically connects whiteness to every conservative idea so if you're conservative this means that you're an advocate of whiteness which means that we need an identity politics is left we need a populist identity politics of the left to fight the white over structure here's what Mishra writes mr. Trump appeals to some appears to some of these powerful but insecure men as an able-bodied defender of the higher races the Muslim baiting British conservative politician Boris Johnson says that he's increasingly admiring of Donald Trump mr. Murray the British journalist thinks mr. Trump is reminding the West of what is great about ourselves the Canadian YouTube personality Jordan Peterson claims that his loathing of identity politics would have driven him to vote for Trump so in other words all of these guys are apparently white supremacists because Trump is a white supremacist and Trump was reading Teddy Roosevelt I find all of this highly doubtful but it's this identity politics of the left that has has driven the left into a populous area with regard to race now they're obviously in a populist area with regard to opposition to free markets Bernie Sanders represents that side of the party and then finally you have the Democrats embracing this distrust of institutions the idea that all of our institutions are riddled with corruption and evil and therefore must be torn down from the inside this has been matched on the right by the rise of a sort of comparative populism this looks a lot more like European politics by the way the far-right politics in Europe look a lot like what's happening on the populist right here in the United States which is big government but distrust of big corporations anger at immigrants and a belief that free markets are corrupt inherently and and we're starting to see that you know in on the right and it's disquieting I don't like it on the left it's really ugly on the left and I think the reactionary right is is doing some of the same stuff as an example President Trump yesterday was giving a speech in which he was talking about the quote-unquote old corrupt globalist ruling class now remember President Trump is the President of the United States he is the head of a government that has Republicans in charge of the House and the Senate the executive branch is incredibly powerful the Supreme Court is largely stacked with Republican appointees and yet here he is railing against the idea of this old corrupt globalist ruling class which is the populist language of distrust of institutions and free markets yeah this sort of populism is is anti classical liberalism it when he says globalist ruling class I'm not sure what he means he's very unclear about this terminology but it perpetuates this myth that people are losing their jobs because there is a cabal of people in power on the coast who are attempting to remove jobs from people in the middle of the country and send them to China which is not actually accurate free trade policy is not responsible for the vast majority of job loss in the United States free trade policy is really involved with the vast majority of growth in the United States technological progress is what its created job loss and manufacturing for the most part because manufacturing output is the same as it's ever been for the last thirty years here's President Trump going off on the old globalist ruling class which sounds a lot like Bernie Sanders frankly the so-called resistance is mad because their ideas have been rejected by the American people they're the old and corrupt globalist ruling class that squandered trillions of dollars on foreign adventures I mean that that foreign adventures language that's that's like Ron Paul Bernie Sanders stuff right the idea that we're we've squandered money on foreign we are still involved by the way in a war in Afghanistan the President of the United States has spent an enormous amount of money on the military as he should but this is this populism of the right which is rising to meet a populism of the left is not good the best indicator of this last night was Tucker Carlson who's a very into a lot of this populist rhetoric now I think Tucker's a really talented host I think Tucker has a lot of intelligent things to say but here he was yesterday legitimately repeating Bernie Sanders talking points to go after Amazon now going after Amazon has become a preoccupation since President Trump decided particular corporations are worth targeting Amazon is a fine American corporation that provides literally hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country keeps other businesses in business because you can sell your product at via Amazon I've never understood the attacks on Amazon it doesn't make any sense to me Bernie Sanders is attached on Amazon have been that Amazon doesn't pay its workers enough but the reality is the Amazon pays the workers what they are willing to accept because no one is being forced into a job the chief reason that Amazon like a lot of major corporations in the United States doesn't pay very much to its workers is because number one they don't have to write supply meets demand in the labor market as well and second because the government provides an enormous amount of aid in the form of food stamps and welfare programs to supplement the income that people are from corporations like Amazon if you actually want Amazon's pay rates to go up all you have to do is remove a lot of these government subsidies and then Amazon will start paying higher wages because no one can accept a job that is not a quote unquote living wage you hear this phrase a lot from the left a living wage Amazon's not paying a living wage what by definition Amazon is paying a living wage or you would be dead right any lennie wage that you choose to accept is by definition a living wage because if you were dead you couldn't accept it or if we're going to kill you you couldn't accept it what you mean is that it's wage you don't like but the worker likes it enough to take it so here's Tucker Carlson nonetheless using the same populist rhetoric as Bernie Sanders again not trusting free markets because it's more important to distrust institutions and therefore call for a sort of bizarre centralized government control it's certainly enough to pay his employees well but he doesn't a huge number of Amazon workers are so poorly paid they qualify for federal welfare benefits according to data from the nonprofit group new food economy nearly 1 in 3 Amazon employees in Arizona for example was on food stamps last year Jeff Bezos isn't paying his workers enough to eat so you made up the difference with your tax dollars next time you see Jeff Bezos make certain diseases thank you ok it's actually the opposite Jeff Bezos is not paying those people because they aren't paying them less because they're on welfare the welfare exists and therefore he is paying them less that's that's just the way markets work again if there's a subsidy more people are going to be on that subsidy and you are subsidizing the business on the other end the reason that I bring all of this up really is because I think that we're moving toward a darker time in American politics or certain basic principles of classical liberalism are going by the wayside there are inherent contradictions in the populist ideology and philosophy these inherent contradictions are pretty simple let's say that you're an in-group you trust the members of that in-group that's an institutional in-group but you don't trust institutions so why is it you trust your in-group but you don't trust institutions that doesn't make any sense you don't trust free markets but you also don't trust the institutions that are there to restrict the free market so who do you trust which is why populism basically ends up being a lot of NP sloganeering and fulmination about problems without any real solutions but I guess that entry fulminating has become the culmination of our politics and then the most irritating part is that we have politicians who engage in this sort of crap on a regular basis and then gloss over it the minute that it rears ugly head in a second I'm gonna talk about that but first we're gonna have to go over to Daily wire comm for $9.99 a month you can subscribe to daily

leftist here's patrick old tumblr subscribe over at youtube or itunes we have some pretty good stuff coming up on the sunday special this week it is Professor Edie fazer talking about the logical and Aristotelian proofs of God's existence so that's deep stuff go check that out right now we're the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation when one of the as I say one of the elements of deep irritation is that populism because it is seductive population here's the basic picture populism is it's not your fault that is the base of picture populism you got a problem in your life well blame it on the failure of markets or blame it on the failure of institutions or blame it on the out-group that is targeting your in-group never blame it on yourself never say maybe the problem in my life is I live in a free country with a free market with institutions that are largely trustworthy and I'm just effing up my life populism says it's not you it's everybody else and so you see that on the right and on the left and it makes politics nastier because now you have to in groups that see the out-group as an enemy and that means that the battles are going to become worse and worse I was talking with my mom about this last night with regard to the Catholic Church because she was suggested she was saying I don't understand how it is that there are so many people in various institutions that are willing to go along with for example the abuse of children just to protect their institution and I was explaining to her that human psychology is such that we like to belong to groups when these groups make us feel protected this is the in-group mentality that is so endemic to populism but it's also endemic to the human condition if you're part of a group you are safer if your group is threatened you're going to rise to the defense of the group and it does not matter whether the group is threatened for good reason or for bad reason so if you read a child sex abuse scandal as an attack on your group rather than honest a good-hearted attempt to cleanse the group of something bad you are likely to respond by defending your group even if it means defending the bad thing and you're now seeing this inside both political parties as well you're seeing Democrats respond to legitimate criticisms of their policies ideas and politicians as you're attacking my identity and my identity group therefore you're evil and I will fight you and I will try to shut you down I will censor you and I will use every method at my disposal to silence you and then you see on the right every time President Trump for example does something that's actually morally bereft people on the right say well you're actually attacking my in-group it's not that you're attacking Trump I understand your real motive is to destroy my end group and the problem is that in both cases that's sort of half right the right does want to destroy the left in-group and the left doesn't want to destroy the right hand group the only way to get past this is to get past the end groups themselves and say listen I'm not interested in destroying your in-group I don't like your ideology but that's not a group right your group the groups that we're talking about that are really dangerous are these identity politics in groups the identity politics of whiteness or a blackness or of Hispanic Ness I think those are the in groups that I'm not I'm not threatening any of that stuff I see you as an individual and your rip on president Trump for stooping a porn star and then paying off $130,000 that is not necessarily an attempt to destroy whiteness but I think that the radicals in each group have an advantage once people are engaged in a certain tribal loyalty to their in-group radicals are able to take advantage of that because the more radical you are the more you're threatened by the out-group which means that your in-group comes to your defense they say that again slower the more that you are radical the more out groups have reason to attack you but those attacks the very presence of the attacks drives the in-group to greater solidarity so it's easy for radicals to take footholds in in groups that feel threatened that's a very very dangerous thing you're seeing it happened with populism across the country what's truly irritating is some of the people who have been pushing exactly the sort of populism exactly the sort of in-group out-group division those people now claiming that they had nothing to do with it so for example Joe Biden was being at John McCain's eulogy yesterday and Vice President former Vice President Biden who obviously wants to run in 2020 says that he saw John McCain as a unifying figure and he thinks that we need to get past the attacks on each other's motives what he says here is correct and good and anti populist there's only one problem it was always appropriate to challenge another senators judgment but never appropriate to challenge their motive when you challenge their motive it's impossible to get to go but all we do today stop it they're weird because I seem to recall Joe Biden saying this about Mitt Romney's motives going back to the 2012 campaign I campaigned by the way that I think broke the country I think 2012 is really the moment that the country I think fragments it maybe beyond recognition here was Joe Biden driving this leftist populism of identity politics that has crafted that has driven the reaction and led to a populist rise out on all sides look at their budget and what they're proposing Romney wants to let that he said the first hundred days he's gonna let the big banks once again write their own rules unchain Wall Street you're gonna put y'all back in Chains you speaking at a historically black church and historically black church she was saying the Mitt Romney is gonna put y'all back in Chains but don't worry he wasn't questioning anybody's motives Joe Biden also likened the Tea Party to terrorists back during that campaign in 2000 in 2011 actually he said that and even going all the way back to 2008 when he was running against John McCain right he was on the VP side running with Barack Obama against John McCain he said that it was unpatriotic not to back his tax program we want to take money and put it back in the pocket of middle-class people anybody making over 250,000 dollars he's gonna pay me god it's time to be patriotic okay time to jump in time to be part of the deal if you don't have his program you're not a patriot right so all these people who are engaging in this exact sort of populist political rhetoric now they turn around they say they don't like it when Trump does it they were the creators of it so let's be clear where all of this came from and let's also be clear that standing for a certain moral standard when it comes to classical liberalism and politics is actually an important thing there are central principles in American politics and those principles do include seeing ourselves seeing America as the big end group and unified by principle and seeing free markets as a good thing and seeing our institutions as bedrock of American honesty Yalie we're were spoiled in this country really are when it comes to the honesty of our institutions we like to talk about the corruption of American institutions yes there are certain institutions that have corruption embedded in them there are certain there are certain individuals who are corrupt but try another country and see how corrupted is where you're actually paying off police officers to get your business done I mean the idea that of America's great virtues of the fact that our institutions are historically non-corrupt actually okay so let's get into some mailbag let's get into some mailbag so here we go Stephen asks does your wife brag at her work about her husband the lawyer because obviously I bragged a lot about my wife the doctor no after my wife tends to keep what I do on the DL on the down-low because there's a lot of blowback in every institution in California if people know that you're a conservative there have been a few cases where patients have gone in and see my wife and known who she was and she always finds that hilarious and flattering but like a lot of her co-workers don't know what I do for a which is pretty hilarious Rachel's has been what do you think of space force why not just add the duties to the Air Force I'm not sure why you wouldn't have the duties to the Air Force I'm not enough a military expert to know the answer to that question but I do like the idea that we ought to have some sort of military understanding of space because that is a space that we are going to have to protect obviously there are foreign nations that are attempting to militarized space melissa's hey Ben my relationship for four years just ended the main Ravin reason given was that my now ex didn't want to marry me or possibly ever get married if it meant that there would be times of struggle in the relationship he comes from a broken home with a sort of Elizabeth Taylor story on one side my parents have been married for 34 years so I've watched them work through all the tough times and come out stronger as someone who has what appears to be a strong marriage what is your advice to a millennial looking to find a future spouse willing to build a life together including overcoming adversity all the best Melissa well honestly this is an entry level question that you need to be asking the person you're dating now you shouldn't find out four years into the relationship that the person doesn't want difficulties in the relationship and doesn't want marriage like you should be dating for marriage that is the only in my view this is the only purpose to date I really I do not understand the idea of dating to live together I don't understand the idea of dating for sex it doesn't make any sense to me the entire purpose of dating for marriage of dating should be that you want to create a long lasting relationship with ended within which to build a family and that means asking tough questions I'm like the first eight and by the way as soon as you date with direction in mind your dating life is going to change because you're actually going to be able to dismiss people who are waste of your time you're not going to be wasting time with losers who latch on to you for four years and then decide they don't want to get married and ladies you're not going to draw a man in by living with him that's not how this works maybe the old saw they no one buys the cow vein get the milk for free there is a there's a large grain of truth to that you know what you know what kind of women men want to marry the kind of women who make it clear that they want to be married if men can get away with not marrying women then they will do it because that's how men are if you want to get married make clear to the dude you're not doing anything until you get married and he will marry you really there's an entry-level there's in any in any relationship whether it is business or whether it is personal in order for somebody to fully commit to a business relationship they have to have skin in the game the only way to get skin in the game when it comes to actual marriage is to to say you are not going to get anything out of me basically and I mean in terms of sex particularly until marriage actually happens I think that virginity until marriage is not just a good idea for your own protection I think and for your spiritual good I think it's actually a pretty good negotiating tactic is the reality so do what you want it's free country but if you want my advice on how to actually snag the kind of person worth marrying make clear to the person that that's what you're looking for because it draws a different kind of person every job has a job description the job description of husband is not the same as the job description of a guy I want to live with for four years and then get dumped by Veronica says what do we do about religious people who reject conservative politics like being pro socialism because they don't understand that charity isn't the government job well again I think the number of people who truly believe that religion dictates socialism is very low I think there are a lot of socialists who like to use religion as a guise but this sort of progressive social justice religious folks very often these are the same people who suggest that the Bible is fine with abortion so I have a very time tough time believing the the sincerity of those particular motives and I say I don't like questioning people's motives but when the motive clearly does not line up with the purported motive I have a tough time understanding where exactly the gap takes place that said you know there there are lots of it does say in the New Testament that who he who does not work nor shall he eat the the the New Testament focused on sharing and common among us which is one that the left likes to use a lot is specifically talking about the disciples who are being treated more as a family there is something worth noting when it comes to religious talk about the quote/unquote sharing among people religious communities were designed to build out family to larger levels that's basically the idea you're a socialist I'm a communist in my own family right from each according to his ability to each according to her need when it comes to my daughter right that's the way it works inside families that's not the way that works in society at large and trying to apply the rules of religious redistribution ISM in a communal context to a broader society that that compels redistribution ISM is actually a form of theocracy so all these all these sjw's who are quoting the Bible asked them whether they're for theocracy because it's kind of weird Bobby says hey Ben my son was finally born my question is considering to let classical do also like the Opera if so what were your top five operas be can't wait see you in Pittsburgh this November thanks so I do really enjoy opera bezees Carmen on the Magic Flute by Mozart though those would be the top two I'm trying to think what else La Boheme the let's see there there's so much good opera hmm I actually have to think about this one there's some verde there's some Poochyena that's really really good stuff I do like Fidelio which is an underrated opera by Beethoven and but but basically everything by Mozart is just in town Giovanni Don Giovanni sound Giovanni obviously that's a huge how could I forget to on Giovanni my favorite actually evolved them Jay says all husbands in white fight from time to time how do your fights go with your wife and have you ever told her facts don't care about your feelings so I did actually I have ripped off a meme that somebody made about me and fights with my wife whenever my wife my wife does what all women do which is she gets dressed and she puts on makeup and she looks very pretty and then she says do you like this outfit and I say yes I think you look beautiful which is why I don't feel beautiful and then I say impacts don't care about your feelings right so that's I have actually used that line before um but as far as fights with my wife we don't typically tend to fight I mean really we don't fight a lot when we do disagree I think that I've tried to develop over the years the capacity to understand where my own upset is coming from is it coming from her being unreasonable or is it coming from me being unreasonable or glomming on too hard to my own emotional state because sometimes you're just stuck in an emotional state now you're gonna lash out about it you know I've very often fights come because you bottle stuff up for a long time but there are a few key things I think in fights number one never say always are never when you say always remember it's always inaccurate okay there there that's the one time you can use always so when you say to your spouse who you always do X it's a it's a recipe for failure because your spouse doesn't always do X your spouse sometimes does X and it drives you nuts right your spouse does something sometimes to drive you nuts but it's important to recognize that that sometimes is not always also I would say that most of the major fights that you're going to have most of the major character flaws are gonna have get them settled while you're young because by the time you hit 65 you're set in your ways and it's very difficult to change and you see this with with people who are above the age of 60 and I think that it's important to you know try and iron all that stuff out as fast as possible that said why do I fight with my wife sometimes yeah my wife and I had had a bit of a tiff on Sunday it was actually really really funny it ended up being really funny so basically here's the story and she's gonna be so pissed I'm gonna tell this on air so here's the story so my wife was really really tired she'd been tired because she'd be working the previous night and we had to go to this bat mitzvah that you know I didn't know people but she knew the people and so we had to know this bat mitzvah on a Sunday night and my wife has my pet peeve with my wife he's really simple and stupid one she loses her phone all the time like legitimately she's lose it all the time and when she loses her phone she doesn't say to me she does she doesn't look for it for 10 minutes and then say I've lost my phone she immediately says I've lost my phone which makes me feel like she's losing it even when she's not because she'll say I've lost my phone then five seconds later she looked down and it's right there right so in any case we're about to leave and we have both our kids in the house and my parents are taking care of the kids and my wife turns to me she says I don't have my phone and I say well is that a big deal like I've got my phone my parents can call me it's not really a big deal she said well I feel more comfortable to my phone I said okay why don't you just go back in the house and get it we're sitting right outside the house and she says I'm too tired can you get it I said you know okay fine I'm already late to this party okay okay fine and you know I'm not I'm not happy about it my son right now is very attached to me so if I walk back in the house we both sneaked out of the house so he doesn't make a fuss if we walk back in the house my son is going to jump on me like a barnacle on a whale or this is what he does he's two-and-a-half he just runs to me and he grabs my leg and won't let go and it's very cute when you're trying to leave and then he breaks down into a crying fit it's not quite as cute so I say you know it would be better if you went inside because he's not gonna bother you as much it's not I'm really tired I just I don't care enough I don't care enough let's just go I said well now you've got me right because you've just said you didn't you want the phone and you don't want to go and now you're telling me that you don't care and let's go so fine I'll go inside I'll go look for the phone so I go inside I have no idea where the damn phone is well how would I know where the phone is I don't know where she's been in the house so I'm searching around the house and sure enough like a shot out comes my son running to me and grabbing my leg and screaming so I pick him up I'm walking around the house I look around for five minutes I can't find it we're even later to this party I walk out - I finally kind of pushed my son off to my dad and I start to walk out of the house and I walk back to the car and then my and then my son comes charging out the front door after me and I walk back to the I said sweetheart I don't know your phone is can you get up off your butt and go in the house and look for your phone you know where your phone is right like you know where it is or at least you have a better idea cuz you know you worry where the hostage is no no I don't know no I'm not gonna you know I don't need it it's not important and so well now you've made me go in the house and bring my sons running after me and I'm gonna have to go back in the house now and by this point I'm ticked and I said I'm gonna go back in the house mm-hmm and I said I'll go back in the house I look some more can't find the phone right I finally come out I say sweetheart you're being really really unreasonable this is not reasonable and she says well I don't care anymore let's just go so she consents I am extraordinarily post because I'm very angry at this point and when I go angry I tend to go silent rather than yelling I'm not a Yeller so I go silent and we drive for about three minutes and now the car is on and because we're driving and then strangely a phone begins to ring in the car through the speakers of the car and we've tried calling her phone before we got nothing it turns out that it's ringing in the car because even when your phone is on silent it rings through the car speakers right but the car wasn't on when she was sitting in it where was the phone the entire time they need her bud so if she had just gotten up for ten seconds she would have seen that the phone was right there and we would not have had to do any of this it was my dad calling just to tell me that the kids were fine and I said dad if I come home in the car by myself it's because I tossed my wife's body in a lake and and you know don't tell the cops we both started laughing because sometimes is something out of a sitcom so that's that's typically how our fights kind of go they usually end with us laughing about most of them but my I will say my wife is an incredibly understanding and giving person and so when I have critiques of her she takes them really well and I've tried to do the same and it means that our fights become us fights and more discussions about how we can improve in the future which is the best way to handle things and it has to be less accusatory for fights has to be less accusing and a lot more sort of you know here's how we can fix the problem it has two fights have to be proud to be problem-solving oriented they have to start off as understanding Orient's and then move to problem solving they can't start off as problem solving and then move to understanding because if you start off with I want to solve this problem the other person doesn't feel understood that's a hard one for me okay let's see let's see girl says what are your thoughts on the operating paradigms for media bias should members of the media be transparent with their personal biases and operate along the lines of their biases or should members of the media always seek to be central line in their coverage perhaps there's a difference between an ideal and practical approach so I think that we should know how everyone feels politically and then we can take it with a grain of salt and you can say listen I'm a conservative but I'm trying to cover this story straight right I do this on the show all the time actually I say I say all the time on the show I'm a conservative but I'm gonna try and be as objective as possible on this story you can take my objectivity with a grain of salt but at least I'm gonna try and separate my opinion out that seems to me the honest way to do things being completely transparent is the best way okay final one mark says hey man I'm addicted to all things ben shapiro the first thing i do when my feet hit the floor every day is check daily wire that question is what sites do you check what are your first couple of go-to sites when you start your day thanks your biggest fan Mary please come to Tampa soon so my honestly I'm a Twitter guy obviously I'm on Twitter all the time one of the reasons I tweet so often is because it's also where I get my news a lot of my retweets the reason I retweet so often is to remind myself of stuff that I want to talk about or write about a little bit later in the day twitter is still the central source of news so I think that's that's something worth noting okay you know what I lied one more sorry guys here it is oh there's so many good questions today and I'm so mad Jacob says hey Ben my name is Jacob okay I'm a 19 year old college student I'm also a proud third degree member of the Knights of Columbus and a proud Catholic with the recent news of the scandals inside the Vatican a lot of hate for my church has come to light it pains me to hear people talk like this about my faith as a very religious person and since people of the Jewish faith are no strangers to hate you have any advice on how to deal with it Thank You Jacob well I think you have to determine what the cause of the hatred is very often people are using the hatred of a particular incident or thing as an excuse for hatred of the church generally you see the sedan's high Semitism all the time it's like they just people hate the Jews and they just find some sort of hook to latch on so people hate the Jews because all the Jews are communists no people hate the Jews because all the Jews are capitalist pigs no people hate the Jews because of the State of Israel no people hate the Jews because there are rootless nation less people the same thing happens with regard to any out group if you hate the out group you can find an excuse to hate the out group and trying to identify whether this is an honest critique of the in-group is a worthwhile endeavor you try to determine from from where all of this is coming okay you know I lied again this is it's a good question so this is I promise this is the actual last one and we'll do a very short things I like in things I hate just to just to round it up Gregory says dear supreme overlord Shapiro recently I got into a debate with one of my good friends over the definition of racism my friend contends that according to people with PhDs who study the issue true racism is when the race that holds power or privilege in a society uses that power or privilege to suppress other people of other races now a friend went on to say because of white privilege it is only possible for white people to be racist I found my friends definition of racism to be very disturbing because I personally believe racism is something that occurs anytime someone is treated unfairly solely based on the color of their skin I do not believe power or privilege in society plays any role in determining what is deemed racist I'd like to get your opinion well I totally agree with you now does that mean that all racism is inherently equally dangerous of course not racism combined with power is a lot more dangerous than racism combined with non power but racism is itself is a toxic brew and even if you are victimized and you engage in racism what you are doing is poisoning your kids and you never know in a free country and even in non free societies which race is gonna end up on top again right this is the problem with the argument that racism is inherently connected to power well so if a group let's take some Bob way for example whites were racist against Blacks in Zimbabwe clearly clearly hey now let's say that that's and into blacks many blacks were racist against whites and Zimbabwe was that a good thing was that an okay thing well maybe the argument would go they didn't have any power so they couldn't actually be racist but then it turns out that black folks took power in Zimbabwe and then that regime has now reduced farmers white farmers in Zimbabwe to almost a subject state by seizing their land is that what we did only become racism when they gain power or is it just that racism itself is something toxic evil and and terrible and it is made a lot worse in terms of real-world effect by power it's not that it's not that racial hatred plus power equals racism it's that racial hatred equals racism racism plus power equals something a lot more dangerous and it's the easiest way to explain it okay time for things I like and then things I hate so the thing I like today is a book called the diversity delusion by Heather McDonald we're gonna have Heather McDonald on the Sunday special at some point in the future it's a really really good book it's all about the subtitle is how race and gender pandering corrupt the University and undermine culture our colleges have become repository of leftist thought that leftist thought has led to exactly the sort of identity politics populism we are seeing right now and the exactly the sort of rise of democratic socialism and hatred of Central American principles we've seen Heather McDonald details all of the nuttiness going on in our university level with Letran intimately familiar go check out the diversity delusion by Heather McDonald who full disclosure I'm friends with and we became friends because I like her writing so much so go check it out Heather McDonald the diversity delusion okay time for a quick thing that I hate Stephen a Smith said something dumb on ESPN because today ending and why and he was talking about Serena Williams and he said about Serena Williams that if she were a man we would call her the greatest ever you just say that if she were a man what would we be saying we'd be calling her the greatest ever there would be no dispute we wouldn't even be talking about Michael Jordan and that we would have be talking about Mohammed Ali we would be talking about Serena Williams because of the sustained level of greatness and I think the only reason we haven't is because she's a woman well no the reason that we haven't is because I mean I guess so in that she would lose to the two hundredth ranked men's player so there's that we can say she's the greatest woman ever if he really believes that she that it's only there's only sexism that prevents us from calling her the greatest ever then why don't we just have open brackets at the US Open really we just do that like no sex no sex discrimination at all we'll just have men and women compete in the same brackets and then we'll see if she is indeed at the greatest ever or if she's the greatest woman I don't see what's wrong by the way with being the greatest woman ever like what's so bad about this why is that so terrible it doesn't why can't we just acknowledge that men are more physically powerful than women on average and also far more physically powerful at the upper end of the bell curve why is this it why is this so difficult it's because everything is stupid somebody tweeted out today there's a big story about income disparity when it comes to tennis when a complex sport said Venus Williams demanded equal pay for women before Steph Curry was even in college and then it says total earnings highest-paid male tennis player Roger Federer seventy seven point two million dollars highest paid female tennis player Serena Williams eighteen point 1 million dollars you know why because far more people care about men's tennis they care about women's tennis the ratings are fire far higher for men's tennis the players are far better in men's tennis the players are more popular in men's tennis I mean this is like saying well you know the pay in the NBA is just orders of magnitude larger than the WNBA right because no one in history has ever wanted to see the WNBA for basketball reasons no one right people want to see the a WNBA for political reasons or for gender parity reasons or to show their daughters that girls can play basketball too oh that's fine but if you're looking for a display of physical athleticism and skill you're not actually going to want to watch the WNBA WNBA championship teams could be beat by the leading high school teams men's high school teams boys high school teams in America the Women's World Cup soccer team there's the story that came out when they won the World Cup and I think 2000 something like that they played like a good high school or good college soccer men's soccer team in Australia and lost six nothing something again none of this is to suggest that women can't be great at sports they're held a lot better than I am I mean I wouldn't get on the court with serene wheelers you blow me away obviously but if we are going to be honest about discrepancies and disparities we can't attribute them all to discrimination otherwise we are just being idiots okay we will be back here next week have yourself a wonderful Labor Day weekend enjoy it come back refreshed on Tuesday I'm sure the world will have imploded in some fashion and we'll talk about all of it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is
