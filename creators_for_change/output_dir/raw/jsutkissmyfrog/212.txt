3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,020
British Museum after work casually in

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,730
fact it's still here look I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font>

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,139
staying too long<font color="#CCCCCC"> max I feel like it's</font>

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,940
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> overwhelming but and what's nice</font>

7
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,990
about living near it is that you can

8
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">just gonna pop in see one thing fucking</font>

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,139
leave so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like he was really</font>

10
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">special kind of statue of Aphrodite</font>

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,230
which i think is a copy of a Greek it's

12
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,760
like a Roman statue there's a copy of a

13
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,789
Greek statue<font color="#CCCCCC"> second century AD and it's</font>

14
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking beautiful but that doesn't</font>

15
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,910
really set it apart because we're in the

16
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,260
British Museum like it was one of

17
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,970
Aphrodite kind of crouching which is

18
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,380
quite a famous pose for her I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

19
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,850
on a few bars<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there as well it</font>

20
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:33,989
suppose to be catching<font color="#CCCCCC"> her in a moment</font>

21
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:36,149
of washing and she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like trying</font>

22
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to hide her body from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the viewers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

23
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,239
kind of putting you immediately in the

24
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,250
position of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the viewer and which kind of</font>

25
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,840
makes you all feel a little bit pervy

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,100
which things the point pervy isn't

27
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:44,960
really probably the technical

28
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,680
sociological term but that's what makes

29
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,539
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel makes you go crazy I love it</font>

30
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,739
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of perspectives one because</font>

31
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it assumes she's God</font>

32
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,739
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> she just washes is that old Gilbert</font>

33
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:54,840
and George aspect of the gods that even

34
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,160
the Greeks and the Romans<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognized</font>

35
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,420
which I really really like it's like

36
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,770
making a statue of Miley Cyrus pick an

37
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,449
event i mean really interests me<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

38
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,890
boy dressed it comes back because<font color="#CCCCCC"> me of</font>

39
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,270
union or not voluntarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is very</font>

40
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,319
appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this vlog because i</font>

41
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,188
think that's probably the first vlog

42
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,530
have ever done proper public public I'm

43
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,070
stuttering<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh god</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> certain people okay</font>

44
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,020
well i just looked at good eye contact

45
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,610
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh god well if it was interesting</font>

46
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,960
even is just trying to hide her body she

47
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,040
was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing a very good job</font>

48
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,659
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could see things and she what she</font>

49
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,189
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> being successful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

50
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,720
of like it was supposed to capture<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

51
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment of like spontaneous like all</font>

52
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,140
don't look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me and I feel like that's</font>

53
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">what a lot of kind of activity on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,590
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people who aren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SP were</font>

55
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,970
don't upload to YouTube that's that's

56
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,040
their kind of initial reaction is like

57
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,240
oh god don't look at me<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I'm not gonna</font>

58
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,829
put my stuff up there people will see it

59
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,150
it's not good to share your personal

60
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,920
life on the internet and that's

61
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,790
something that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been worrying about</font>

62
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,780
lately because of you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

63
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,180
professionalism and<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and like oh</font>

64
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,710
this is my favorite hobby but I don't

65
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,180
stop it but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compromising with</font>

66
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,140
your ear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it made me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really think</font>

67
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,280
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of like spontaneous</font>

68
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,020
aspect of like covering and what that

69
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">really cuz you know actually I think the</font>

70
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,350
stuff that I can expose on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and</font>

71
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,560
stuff I think maybe just small get<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

72
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,880
harm okay sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look like a twat</font>

73
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">and sometimes before we deliver a</font>

74
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,640
professional and I swear a lot but I

75
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,860
feel like on balance and it's that

76
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,479
initial I want to shy away from that

77
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,670
initial gut reaction of what all don't

78
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,560
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at me because when I can for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dottie</font>

79
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,568
I don't think I really succeed in hiding

80
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,459
myself in general because that's the

81
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,370
kind of person I am and I

82
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,569
that's how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a little</font>

83
00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more exposing because privacy is</font>

84
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,319
born from a place of suspicion and

85
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,670
sometimes that's efficient is very very

86
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,349
well placed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really a lot of</font>

87
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,730
fucked up things as well but the same

88
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,000
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think trying me trying to stop</font>

89
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">making these videos which be</font>

90
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,650
counterproductive because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever want to</font>

91
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,060
spontaneously share my life with people

92
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,260
and that's how I wanna spend it and then

93
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,900
sets of journalism or writing or that

94
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,430
you know it being off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rim writing</font>

95
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,049
about your most intimate experiences is

96
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,670
encouraged and something but if you want

97
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to blog about your breakup on the</font>

98
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,019
internet somehow not is called and so

99
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,400
yeah that's Aphrodite taught me today

100
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,709
thanks Aphrodite this has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a very</font>

101
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,599
voyeuristic episode of in it oh it's so

102
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">met like I watched a statue that knew</font>

103
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was looking and put me in the pic</font>

104
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,640
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> viewer now I'm talking about</font>

105
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">being viewed outside while I'm being</font>

106
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:58,209
viewed oh my god oh my god this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

107
00:02:58,209 --> 00:00:00,000
matter must stop
