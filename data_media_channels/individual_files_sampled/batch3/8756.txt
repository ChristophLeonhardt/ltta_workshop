Sandra: THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. THE BIG NEWS WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING FOR YOU THE PAST HOUR, AN AMERICAN PASTOR HELD PRISONER IN TURKEY FOR TWO YEARS WILL SOON BE HEADING HOME. A COURT IN TURKEY FREEING ANDREW BRUNSON JUST MINUTES AGO. PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETING MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH PASTOR BRUNSON APPEARED HOPE TO HAVE HIM SAFELY BACK HOME SOON. JOINING US BY PHONE SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM. THANK YOU FOR CALLING IN. THIS HAS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR YOU. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THE NEWS? WELL, I'M PLEASED. I WON'T CELEBRATE UNTIL HE GETS HOME. I THINK THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE AND TRULY BIPARTISAN, SENATORS TILLIS, LANGFORD AND SHAHEEN WE VISITED PASTOR BRUNSON MONTHS AGO IN TURKEY. ALLOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND TURKEY TO IMPROVE AND HE IS A FINE MAN, PASTOR BRUNSON AND HIS WIFE, AND I'M JUST GOING TO WITHHOLD COMMENT UNTIL HE GETS HOME BUT THIS IS A GREAT DAY AND IT MAYBE STARTS A NEW BEGINNING WITH THE U.S./TURKEY RELATIONSHIP. Jon: CAN YOU SAY, WAS HE SIMPLY A PAWN IN THIS BATTLE OVER THE ATTEMPTED COUP THAT TRIED TO DISLODGE PRESIDENT ERDOGAN THERE? I THINK HE GOT CAUGHT UP IN SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST NOT OF HIS OWN MAKING. I'VE NEVER BELIEVED ONE MINUTE THAT PASTOR BRUNSON HAD ANY ILL WILL TOWARD THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT. THERE WAS A COUP AGAINST PRESIDENT ERDOGAN. THE MILITARY DID TRY TO TAKE HIM OUT AND PHYSICALLY DETAIN HIM. IT IS A TENSE TIME IN TURKEY AND PRESIDENT BRUNSON HAS BEEN THERE FOR 25 YEARS PREACHING THE GOSPEL. A SITUATION WHERE HE GOT CAUGHT UP IN A SITUATION THAT NOT OF HIS MAKING AND IT'S BEEN TWO LONG YEARS. I VISITED HIM IN JAIL AND TALKED TO PRESIDENT ERDOGAN ABOUT IT. THE RELATIONSHIP NEEDS TO IMPROVE AND A GREAT STEP FORWARD. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENT PENCE HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THIS. SENATOR LANGFORD, TILLIS AND SHAHEEN HAVE BEEN PUSHING HARD FOR A LONG TIME. WHEN HE GETS HOME I'LL FEEL BETTER. HE IS NOT HOME YET. Sandra: SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC UNTIL HE SETS FOOT ON AMERICAN SOIL. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION WITH TURKEY TO ACTUALLY MAKE THAT HAPPEN? WHAT WILL THE DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS BE TO ACTUALLY FACILITATE HIS RETURN? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COURT PROCEDURES ARE ALL ABOUT. I THINK HE HAS BEEN CONVICTED AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO BEING ALLOWED TO COME HOME FOR TIME SERVED. I KNOW OUR EMBASSY PERSONNEL, MIKE POMPEO HAS BEEN TERRIFIC. I WENT THERE SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, TALKED TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, TALKED TO PRESIDENT ERDOGAN DIRECTLY. I KNOW MIKE POMPEO'S TEAM IS HANDLING THE DETAILS AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THIS BEHIND US. I TOLD PRESIDENT ERDOGAN IT WOULD BE HARD FOR US TO GO FORWARD IN A PRODUCTIVE FASHION UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED AND TURKEY IS A STRATEGIC ALLY. IT'S AN IMPORTANT RELATIONSHIP. WE HAVE AN AIR BASE THERE. THEY HELPED US IN SYRIA. KEEP OUR FINGER CROSSED AND I HOPE HE WILL COME HOME SOON AND POMPEO'S PEOPLE ARE WORKING HARD. Jon: THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SLAPPED SANCTIONS ON THE INTERIOR AND JUSTICE MINISTER OF TURKEY IN PART AS A RESULT OF THE BRUNSON CASE. WOULD YOU EXPECT THOSE NOW WILL BE DROPPED? I WOULD HOPE SO. I WOULD THINK SO. LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP. HE HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THIS. TRIED TO GIVE TURKEY THE SPACE THEY NEED TO GET A RESULT GOOD FOR BOTH COUNTRIES. HE HAS BEEN VERY PRACTICAL AND FIRM. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF, I THINK, PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP WORKING WITH AN ALLY OVER A VERY CONTENTIOUS EVENT. TRYING TO FIND THE SPACE NECESSARY TO GET A GOOD OUTCOME BUT BEING TOUGH. AND SO POMPEO'S PEOPLE ARE WORKING AS WE SPEAK. THIS WILL GIVE US A NEW LIFE IN THE U.S./TURKEY RELATIONSHIP. Sandra: FASCINATING TO WATCH. AS FAR AS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN TURKEY IS CONCERNED, WE ALL KNOW IT HAS BEEN A DETERIORATING SITUATION THERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS ADMINISTRATION SEEM UNMOFSHD BY THAT IN EFFORTS TO GET PASTOR BRUNSON HOME. THEY HAD A GOAL TO MAKE SURE THIS FINE MAN WOULD COME BACK HOME. HE GOT CAUGHT UP INTO SOMETHING NOT OF HIS MAKING AND WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? WE GET PASTOR BRUNSON HOME OTHER PEOPLE ARE BEING DETAINED THAT WORK FOR THE U.S. EMBASSY. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THEM, TOO. WE AREN'T GOING TO FORGET ABOUT THEM. THEY'RE TURKISH NATIONALS. A DEA AGENT THERE. PEOPLE STILL BEING DETAINED WE THINK INAPPROPRIATELY AND WE AREN'T GOING TO FORGET ABOUT THEM. IF THEIR FAMILIES ARE LISTENING WE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU. HOW DOES THIS MOVE FORWARD? I HOPE ONE DAY TO HAVE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT WITH TURKEY. THEIR ECONOMY IS IN DECLINE. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THEIR ECONOMY AND OUR ECONOMY TO HAVE A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND SHOW WE'RE WORKING AS A PARTNER AND A TEAM. THAT'S A WAYS OFF. THAT'S MY GOAL. Jon: THERE WAS A TIME TURKEY WAS DEMANDING THE U.S. EXTRADITE INTO TURKISH CUSTODY, AN ISLAMIST PREACHER WHO THE GOVERNMENT THERE, ERDOGAN, CONSIDERS AN ENEMY OF THE GOVERNMENT. DID THAT EVER COME INTO CONSIDERATION, THAT KIND OF EXCHANGE? WE HAVE A PROCESS TO LOOK AT WE'RE AN EVIDENCE-BASED, LEGAL-BASED COUNTRY, NOT JUST POLITICAL TRADES HERE. THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OF I THINK THE GENTLEMAN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT WHAT HIS ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN. HAVE THEY BEEN AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY? HAVE THEY BEEN CRIMINAL? THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION OF THE PERSON YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. AND WE'LL SEE WHERE THAT TAKES US. WE NEVER LINKED THE TWO. THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE. THAT WAS REJECTED FROM THE START. TURKEY UNDERSTOOD THAT. THEY HAVE A LEGAL SYSTEM, WE HAVE A LEGAL SYSTEM. I WANT TO THANK PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SECRETARY POMPEO FOR WORKING HARD. BUT THIS IS A TIME WHEN CONGRESS HELPED. WE WERE PRETTY TOUGH ABOUT THE S-400 MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM FROM RUSSIA. THEY'RE A NATO ALLY. THAT'S AGAINST EVERYTHING WE BELIEVE. WE'RE TRYING TO SELL THEM THE F-35 AND HAVING AN S-400 SYSTEM SOLD TO THE TURKEY BY RUSSIA IS A VERY BAD SITUATION. WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT. THAT COMES LATER. WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO HAVE A NORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH TURKEY. Sandra: I HAVE TO ASK YOU MEANWHILE BECAUSE PASTOR BRUNSON'S RELEASE, SENATOR GRAHAM, COINCIDES WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF JAMAL GASH GASH, THE SAUDI COLUMNIST FOR THE "WASHINGTON POST" WHO WAS INSIDE THE SAUDI CONSULATE IN INSTAN BULL. TURKEY SAYS THEY HAVE VIDEO AND AUDIO EVIDENCE THAT KHASHOGGI WAS KILLED. WHAT IS YOUR LATEST THINKING ON WHAT WE'RE LEARNING HERE? BECAUSE WE DID NOT KNOW MUCH AT FIRST AND CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE. WELL, WITH EVERY PASSING DAY IT'S MORE LIKELY HE IS DEAD. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SHERLOCK HOLMES TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE. HE GOES INTO THE CONSULATE AT 1:15 IN THE AFTERNOON. GIVES HIS CELL PHONE TO HIS FIANCE AND NEVER COMES OUT. I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT SAUDI ARABIA HAD TARGETED HIM IN THE PAST. HE HAS BEEN A DISSIDENT IN THE MILDEST FORM. IF THIS IS TRUE THAT HE WAS ABDUCTED AND KILLED AT THE DIRECTION OF THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT, IT WILL DESTROY THE RELATIONSHIP AS WE KNOW IT. I'VE BEEN THE BIGGEST DEFENDER OF SAUDI ARABIA. I'VE BEEN A BIG CHAMPION OF THE RELATIONSHIP. I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES USUALLY WITH SENATOR MCCAIN. THE CROWN PRINCE TALKED ABOUT REFORMING THE COUNTRY IN A WAY THAT IS PLEASING AND APPROPRIATE. BUT IF HE AND OTHERS WERE INVOLVED IN THIS, THAT WOULD BE AN OFFENSE TO ME, TO OUR VALUES. IT WOULD BE CONTEMPT FOR THE U.S./SAUDI RELATIONSHIP AND IT WOULD DESTROY IT IN MY EYES. AND I WOULD DO EVERYTHING I COULD TO PUNISH THE SAUDI REGIME IF THEY DID, IN FACT, KILL THIS MAN BECAUSE OF HIS DISSIDENT VOICE. THAT WOULD BE A COMPLETE DISRESPECT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP AND I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE OTHERS UNDERSTOOD WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS. Jon: A LOT OF PEOPLE ON CAPITOL HILL ARE TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CANCELING $110 BILLION WORTH OF ARMS SALES TO THE SAUDIS. WOULD YOU GO THAT FAR? THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA. HE MAY BE RIGHT BUT I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL USED AND ABUSED, QUITE FRANKLY PERSONALLY. I'VE STOOD WITH THE SAUDIS AFTER THE 9/11 ACTIONS HERE, I'VE TRIED TO HELP THE GOVERNMENT. THEY'VE BEEN A STRATEGIC ALLY. THEY HELP US WITH TERRORISM. THEY'VE BEEN STANDING UP TO IRAN. THEY'VE BEEN BETTER TOWARD ISRAEL. BUT IT MUST BE TAKING US FOR GRANTED. TO THINK THAT A GUY LIKE ME AND MY COLLEAGUES WOULD ACCEPT THIS AND JUST GO BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL IS COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTANDING WHO WE ARE. OUR FOREIGN POLICY HAS A COMPONENT OF OUR VALUES AND OUR HUMAN RIGHTS VALUES. AND WE DON'T BELIEVE IN MURDERING PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY ARE DISSIDENT AND YOU HAVE TO DO BUSINESS WITH UNSAVERY CHARACTERS IN THIS BUSINESS BUT WHEN YOU HAVE AN ALLY YOU HAVE TO LET THEM AND THE WORLD KNOW WHO YOU ARE. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE AND IF THE CROWN PRINCE WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS IN ANY FASHION, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO BE A LEGITIMATE LEADER ON THE INTERNATIONAL
