Sirians in search of safety there may be less violence because of Russian brokered local ceasefires but there are still active frontlines in some areas of the country over the past year the opposition lost a sizable territory and the Syrian government with the backing of Russia and Iran have also recaptured areas from ISIL the government is stronger than it has been since the conflict began nearly seven years ago but the war is not nearing its end the war is far from over that is for sure Ian what we're seeing is perhaps winding down a bit of the conflict and some parts there is a likelihood of an escalation or flare-up and further conflicts and other parts of the country almost a quarter of the country in the northeast for example is outside the state's control the mainly Kurdish region wants a federal system for Syria the government once said it would be ready to discuss this but now it calls the Kurds traitors for working with a foreign country and the u.s. decision to maintain a troop presence in the end clave has alarmed Russia which says there is no legitimate reason for them to stay the war is not over but the focus is already on dividing the spoils russia's President Vladimir Putin wants to play a lead role in brokering a political settlements the Kremlin has successfully created an alternative path for negotiations the Russian led talks in Astana have overshadowed the un-led Geneva process and now Putin plans to host the Syrian peace conference in Sochi Russia's leader says he has the support of Iran and Turkey countries that are deeply involved in the conflict he also says Syria's President Bashar al-assad is backing the peace initiative that may weaken his powers but leave him in office for at least a few years with a reformed Constitution we will likely see as a Syrian not divided but divided in terms of spheres of influence it will be like a multinational company with countries holding shares and of course Russia having the biggest share a political settlement is still a long way off for opponents of the government what is being discussed doesn't amount to peace but priorities have changed in 2017 calls for us to be removed from power were no longer hurt Western leaders now seem to be more concerned with working with Russia to counter Iran's growing influence in Syria sanika dar al jazeera Beirut
