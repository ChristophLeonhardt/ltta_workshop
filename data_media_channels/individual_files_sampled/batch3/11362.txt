hey this is max bit about Kaiser this is the Kaiser report oh we got all kinds of good stuff for you today yeah baby Staci max yeah I want to bring up the issue of squirrels because the squirrels in this world they're the bane of my existence we have many squirrels around here in North Carolina and you know I noticed because they're always dodging in front of my car and then I have to screech to a stop and though he's running in front of the road and they have a little acorn in their mouth and they're like they think I'm gonna stay lit right and I spend all day long so so busy so engaged in burying all these acorns all over the place because they're stupid right and they have a bad memory so they don't learn from history they that the fact is that they lose their acorns all the time though they're so afraid of somebody stealing it and this is how stupid I think we as a human race are this is a very interesting analogy that you're making there with the squirrels you know they got their own economy you're coming down harsh on the squirrels they hide nuts and then other squirrels find nuts and it's a big nut economy it all works out in the end the squirrels have been around for a long long time they were here before humans were here their ancestors and they'll be here after we're all gone because they got a unique way of surviving this world well even think about it they bury these nuts and then other squirrels find it now look at this whole resistance movement in America and the media space we have they basically ran on a platform of outrage and looking for anything to get the other side fired and now it's backfiring on a lot of media personalities here in the United States from the left wing the from the resistance I might point out joy Reed or Samantha bee everybody's looking we as a media and cultural people are spending our time searching I got some sauce on that well we're searching for those little nuts that had been planted the seeds the the acorns and nuts that somebody planted in an old blog post from like 20 years ago and we're trying to say fire that person fire that person yeah you the squirrels versus the maximum predators in the white house that have lunch roasting up squirrel meat of all these media personalities here's the deal you've got basically profanity arbitrage you got a profanity arbitrage in the making you see Trump can say anything he wants to say and you can't fire him you know it won't be another election until 2020 and he's gliding into 2018 probably won't even lose many representatives and support in the in this election and this year so he says something outrageous he says something profane that's not profound in any way and then celebrities like a Sarah Silverman or its Samantha bee or is Roseanne Barr and there's got to be some guys too in this mix I can't think of any at the moment but they say these outrageous things or they tweet these outrageous things and the course corporate America will immediately fire them and they are out on the street because there's profanity arbitrage so it reminds me if we were living in the South of France if you recall and we live next door to a very famous Chateau and this is where the Rolling Stones recorded one of their earliest records asylum mainstream Exile on Main Street and a lot of the locals try to keep up with Keith Richards with his heroin use and they all died but Keith Richards lived because Keith Richards is immortal but a lot everyone else died so it's like these guys say the equivalent of the squirrels that run in front of the car and don't have somebody as nice as I to stop and let them pass most people just run them over but I stop yeah you know actually when you talk about Trump's tweets and he gets away with it if you look throughout history and mad emperors and mad kings if you look at the series the tutors it's a good demonstration of this Henry the eighth was deranged okay he killed all his friends he executed half the royal family of aristocrats all over everybody right and everybody had around him had just like your highness you're such a benevolent King and of course this is same thing with where the the grotesqueness of Trump and his tweets when you see Europeans when you see Asians when you see everybody responding as if like oh well we're close allies of America even though Trump has tweeted like they're bimbos over there and we're never gonna we're gonna slap on some tariffs and we're not gonna deal with those people and they're like they have to be polite and pretend that America has become like British or a European aristocracy yeah and they have forsaken their role of telling truth to power years ago decades ago they become an instrument of corporate power they're very little media so I agree with Trump when he calls people from NBC CBS ABC fake news because they are and using Twitter to go directly to the public has worked brilliantly and I take umbrage at insulting King Henry the eighth like this because of course he did invent the Church of England which in America became Episcopalian ISM which is my there are other stories that of you know in this hyperactive media world where you have Twitter all day long and you need you know excitement and people forget the new cycle within a few moments just like squirrels forget where they buried their ACORN we have stories like that derange story I don't know what really happened but some deranged pretend assassination a fake assassination that happened in Ukraine because the Ukrainian media or the lobbyists and the think tanks couldn't wait creating squirrels with media amnesia staged a fake assassination in Ukraine and all the major fake news networks in America NBC CBS and ABC reported in as fact and got in their face and then it was quickly forgotten well exactly because the likes of Rachel Maddow couldn't wait for the real story to happen squirrels so they what happened I don't know I get it by car yeah and the nut is a fake story it's a fake assassination but just like the story about Trump's tax returns that she was so excited like returns I have sex returns and they showed he paid thirty three million dollars in taxes that year and she's like oh I guess that's not so exciting Geraldo Rivera we need the Al Capone's tomb that was the beginning of this fake news cycle he was ahead of the curve Geraldo yes that was like 20 years ago people might not remember that but I'm gonna talk to a story about well in 20 years time again people might not remember this guy Mike Marui but Mike Marui here is profiled I think it's the New York Times what is one of these big papers Mike Marui has 1 million dollars of student loans how did that happen escalating tuition and easy credit have yielded a class of student loan borrowers with spectacular debt they may never pay back due to escalating tuition and easy credit the US has 101 people who owe at least 1 million dollars in federal student loans according to the Education Department five years ago just 14 people it that much more could join that group well the typical student loan borrower owes $17,000 the number of those who owe at least a hundred thousand has risen to around 2.5 million nearly 6% of the borrowing pool according to the Education Department right and they know nothing about it economics when they go to these colleges and universities they study things that have no marketable after college value whatsoever like philosophy or art school and but they are willing to take on a million dollars in debt so that they can enter the workforce find themselves at the mercy of the government's military industrial complex that'll say hey we figured out a way for you to pay off your debt become a drone operator and kill people remotely in villages across the world there have a nice day this is quite multi-layered first of all we do need dentists this guy Mike Maru is an orthodontist doctors perhaps we need lawyers who knows we need plumbers we need electricians we need barristers people who can make our coffee for us we need these sort of people and we need to educate and train them right so there is a need for this but have we gone about it the most deranged way possible have we spent a lot of time just like I said about those squirrels they look really busy all day long running around trying hard to you know plant these little acorns that they whereas taken a million dollars in loan to learn how to be a plumber not yet they're actually making hard money cash and they have a savings account and they're buying the 18% debt of the student loan repackaged and they're making big bucks man these ridiculous debt mongers in fact the US government meaning the US taxpayer backs almost all student loans this happened under Bush essentially during the financial crisis and banks at home on all these bad debts they didn't with the subprime loans they don't want the student debts the government took it on and of course what happens is the financial crisis is the debt tuition went up because the government was now backing the debt so everybody could take out unlimited amounts of debt this is something pass under and the collective stupidity in America keeps escalating yes even though we've paying millions and billions and hundreds of billions to in debt a whole generation of morons yes and of course many in our sort of economy we value debt we think credit and debt are so they're like that amazing acorn this squirrel is found it's so good he's gonna go bury this and make sure he could find it later well of course in 25 years time when these student debts expire hey this guy Mike Maru he always a million dollars because he only borrowed something he borrowed like six hundred thousand dollars to go to USC dental school medical school then dental school and it keeps on he keeps it keeps building because he doesn't even pay anything down towards the principal he doesn't even cover the interest on the debt so by law he doesn't have to pay it after 25 years it just basically expires so in 25 years his debt will be two million dollars even though he's gonna pay $1,300 a month towards us ten percent of his income his after-tax income according to the law here of your you know of the government who owns your debt essentially in 25 years time some taxpayers of the future will find his acorn pushes this a pile of debt that expires there collectively stupid and then they're going to monitor by repackaging these stupid student debt bombs and then sell them into pension accounts that will go to zero every time you say mic Maru I think of this viral video that's out there now flatulating kangaroo i don't know if you've seen that but this kangaroo is flatulating and then it waves away the width it waves it away and actually I it's brought to my attention by that ap report of the in Washington mattli linked to this flashlight and kangaroo so here's a guy who's in the press pool in the White House who has nothing better to do than to talk about hockey and flashlights and kangaroos should you be doing your job maybe in the White House and tell us what's going on he's actually the best one in the west of the best he only has five million in debt how did this stupid program and policy of trying to recover from the financial crisis by pushing the American people essentially into indentured servitude they owe for 25 years this guy has to give ten percent of his income back to my man ISM okay most of mr. Murray's debt came from grad plus a program created by Congress in 2005 and removed loan limits and allowed grad students to borrow for any expense including rent and other living costs the law signed by president george w bush was intended to ease student reliance on private banks which had more strict repayment plans this is the packaging that they sold it to the american people we're just trying to help people you know private banks charge more it's general walking you notice that this is the opposite of the whole PFI how they sell PFI is they say the private sector is more efficient the government can't borrow for cheaper than the private sector but here they're saying the opposite they sold it and pitches it on an opposite story but anyway whereas dubber walking I've invented a new word called debt Walker II debt whacker II its debt whacker II well it's as dumb as a squirrel that's what I'll say its debt whacker II and squirrel and flatulating kangaroos and mattli much more coming your way after the break don't go away welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to return to South Africa and speak with Abraham Cambridge of the Sun exchange now after helping the company securely financing several years ago I'm now advising this company the Sun exchange and they're working with the United Nations Development Program to trial a plan to monetize solar energy that's right solar money you might call it welcome back Abraham it's going to be back alrighty so let's talk Sun exchange as currently as we mentioned working with the UN Development Programme on a pilot program to bring solar to the University of Moldova so how do they judge success in this case like what are they looking at Abraham they're looking at getting emerging markets particularly countries which are landlocked like Moldova with no energy natural resources other than Sun so the goal is to enable these countries to go solar quickly and easily particularly in markets where the solar industry is still rather immature obviously the Sun exchanges mission is to enable anyone to go solar quickly and easily but we've also been working with the solar point foundation since 2014 so the electric chain group who've been issuing the solar point bonuses to anyone who owns a solar panel we partnered with Sun exchange so we can issue these solar points to customers but they also arranged for UNDP will sort of up the UNDP now want us to apply this this model in tumult over so I've seen Moldova Moldova has got a great demand for energy and without that with access to cheap affordable energy their Development Goals are being limited in is one of the one of the clean table and mechanism goals is to enable access to clean energy so in unity B you've got a very very strong interest in getting this model to be proven in Eastern Europe so success for them is to have this rolled out through the whole of Eastern Europe and potentially the rest of the world I mean this one exchange was set up to be is this this global platform to enable anyone to own a solar panel anywhere else in the world and your DPC down right so for those just joining us you know we've been talking about this for a bit now so as you point out anybody anywhere can get involved in the solar energy business and derive an income from that solar energy and this solves problems in areas that have no access to energy because they do have access to however to the Sun and so this is really creating a whole new market now the efficiencies in this are quite remarkable because the efficiencies in crypto are phenomenal you can send pennies around using the crypto Network it doesn't really cost you anything to send pennies and the cost of solar energy is plummeting and so all the components of this business model the raw materials are the components the price is falling so the this allows for that income to be generated so you're capturing something from the Sun the Sun the god the god Apollo is you know another thing I was thinking about this Abraham I'm curious what your thoughts are people talk about universal basic income and you know if everybody had a wallet attached to the Sun everyone would beget an income from the Sun yeah good point I mean the point is that most people in the world today live in apartments or rented accommodation so even if they wanted to own a solar panel they can't because they don't own a roof so that what science change does is enable anyone to now owner solar cells somewhere else on earth and we've broken down that ownership to a single solar cell and you can lease now so sell that big somewhere else on the planet in an income stream for 20 years from it so actual cost of going solar we've reduced by three orders of magnitude east cost more than ten thousand dollars to go solar now people go solar in increments of less than ten dollars and that's that what we believe is that everyone should have the right to be able to access and harness solar power and blockchain payments of an enable that resolution and that speed and that transparency to unlock this kind of business model so follow up on that point let's say hypothetically I'm running the United States of America and I've got a multi trillion dollar budget and I decide I'm going to allocate five hundred billion dollars to solar income and I'm gonna open up wallets for everyone beneath the poverty line I've now given energy currency from the Sun into the pockets of millions of people at a cost effective rate correct yeah I mean you take three hundred and fifty billion dollars to provide basic electricity access to every single person in Africa and that's six hundred and fifty million people who don't have access to power so I've been globally three point four trillion dollars has been pledged into clean energy today that's from institutions and individuals so the money is there we can solar power the planet if we want to we just lacked the platforms and the mechanisms are which to do this and accelerate the process and but as fortunately what has now come to fruition and while you've been growing your company China has basically driven the cost of solar down tremendously so can you give us some breakdown on the cost of setting up a solar operation let's say in Moldova or wherever yes so we're looking now at the installed price for what falling below $1 a watt wid who are we looking probably now down to maybe around eighty cents a watt which is completely unprecedented now you can now look at how the completely unsubsidized solar plan in a country with not tremendously brilliant solar conditions and it still be completely commercial commercially viable I mean the project that we're hosting here in South Africa we always target around an eleven percent IRR or ten to eleven percent IRR on that project such as the one that's there's available and open now and then that's what we'd hope to achieve in all emerging markets as as solar cell prices continue to come down well to see the not all the solar price is the whole river solar installation cost is coming down there are some aspects prices go up such as the actual labor and installation costs some of the copper in the cabling those costs do come up so it's not a completely rosy picture for the whole solar sector but fortunately the most expensive art being the solar panels that they have continued to come down as as economies of scale kick in right now I remember last year we were talking about the possibility plugging a crypto minor into this network for I think start coin we were talking about at the time where you could plug a start coin node into or a miner into what was happening on this platform and not only generate solar currency income but crypto mining income I don't know how far along we are in that discussion but I'm hoping to revisit that sometime in the next few months because interest in start coins is picking up again I guess because we helped finance this back a year ago or so through start showing so there's a lot of synergies now on your blog you recently pointed out that shining a profitable light on plastic stone enter exchange announces an opportunity to earn from solar power south african plastics industry can you expand on that yeah I mean plastics are a huge issue worldwide I mean that they are literally plumbing up our rivers and oceans but the beautiful thing about plastic is it does actually last forever it can be reused so there are factories that manufacture plastic bottles and all these factories are capable of using 100% recycled PE t the plastic aggregate that goes into making bottles so the only thing that's stopping this from being committee Sickler economy is the energy it takes to recycle those bottles so we're solar powering a factory company called nayara plastics they manufacture drinking bottles bottles of detergents and they already pay about 50% recycled plastics into their mix we're hoping that by shining the light on this in this topic but we can only encourage their their customers to demand 100% recycled plastics going into going to that factory exhilarated world we're trying to create we really believe in the triple bottom-line social environmental and economic that's what all of us on exchange projects are about we believe it is possible to make money and do good at the same time then it's not where it's not one or the other and in fact it's gonna be the ugly other side you're actually pretty gonna make more money by being more environmentally environm entity conscious and I can just connect conscientious capital to these projects right the it's a moneymaker to be environmentally conscious because you're taking all the what the corporations call the external costs and which is going into environmental pollution and degradation and you're turning that into a positive income stream how was the South African government reacting to cryptocurrency and blockchain Innovation what's the regulatory framework like well the local municipality here so that has been very very post about Sun exchange they're they're very supportive what we're doing because it's it's about use case you know we actually are utilizing this technology for good we we are enabling direct foreign investment into South Africa providing energy and sustainable energy and reduce energy costs to businesses that's only driving the economy upwards and bringing and creating jobs in South Africa for installing solar plants we've created I don't know how many jobs with and training people how to install the maintained solar plants this is happening so it is such an amazing use case that the government is favorable and positive towards I think what they are concerned about is is some of these schemes and pyramid schemes that are always going to happen but not just in crypto you know in old-fashioned money as well so those things people are gonna have to keep an eye on but in terms of actually demonstrates them what we've got good these 10 all you can do sonic changes is being looked at very favorably how about the tech talent in South Africa do you have a rich source of local talent to draw from yeah I mean this is amazing no I'm here it's a rise in Cape Town here we've probably got three four different blockchain businesses including linen labs whoo-hoo right and and audit the theory of smart contracts up in Joburg where our tech team is based we have two three flushing engineers up there now solid in turning out our wallet systems our smart contracts exploring and testing lightning payment lightning Network payment rails to increase the frequency and reduce costs on the payments were making so is it's all happening down here it's a great great industry and it's driven by need and the opportunity that comes from that need and there's an amazing organization it's called we think code which produces some of the brightest and best talent encoders that we've got one of their one of their best students now worked with us full-time building our tech and it's just amazing to have such great resources available to us down here in South Africa well I was talking to Ram nooner who does a show crypto trainer from South Africa he's a South African I sent him the press release about us becoming advisors to stun exchange he was very excited said he knew your company very well he suggested we all have a meet up down in South Africa he said he'd wear his speedos and this some naked pole dancing bar I don't know he's famous for that in South Africa this is news to me is ran nooner actually famous for doing naked pole dancing in South Africa do you have any insight into that I don't know I met Brad wheat we ran an art auction last year to raise money for one of our solar projects could hashtag Sobers the future he came down to watch that he was wearing clothes and it is winter right now so I wouldn't recommend budgie smugglers and I'm pretty aware at least a body wore at the same time well fair enough well let's say goodbye for now thanks for being on the show Abraham Cambridge from the Sun exchange thanks very much well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser and Stacey Herbert like to thank our guests abraham cambridge of the sun exchange if you want to reach us on twitter go to Kaiser report until next time bye hi y'all
