I don't wear it to pay it's my hair I swear he was often quoted as saying that baldness was kind of a terrible thing for any of his executives to suffer and in one account he actually handed out a tuber bro game to someone who was losing his hair in my professional opinion yeah I think he's had a couple things done I think he's had surgery I do and the only way I would know that for a fact would be to examine his head if I had to guess what's up with his hair we were on a a game show and somebody says you have to tell us now what's up with his hair I would say from looking at previous pictures he's had a flap which means that hair from the side of the hair head has been rotated over to the front to give a thick hairline and behind that flap he's had more hair place of what we call grasp to give thickness behind the flap you have to do an inspection sir this is getting crazy this is great just real quick we don't want to mess it up too much because I do use hairspray that is cops come yes I believe it up
