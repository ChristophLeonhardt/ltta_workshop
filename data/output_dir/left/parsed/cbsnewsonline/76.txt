DEMOCRATS HAVE EYED FLAKE'S 
SEAT AS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF 
THEIR PLAN TO REGAIN CONTROL OF 
THE SENATE AND REPUBLICANS HAVE 
SOUGHT TO REPLACE FLAKE WHO WAS 
A FREQUENT CRITIC OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WITH A MORE CONSERVATIVE 
VOICE. 
ONE THING MISSING FROM THAT 
REPUBLICAN RACE, THOUGH, HAS 
BEEN A PRESIDENTIAL 
ENDORSEMENT. 
YOU SEE, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS 
NOT WADED INTO THE SENATE RACE, 
ALTHOUGH ALL THREE CANDIDATES 
USED THE PRESIDENT'S NAME TO 
GARNER SUPPORT. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS, HOWEVER, 
JUMPED INTO THE REPUBLICAN 
PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR OVER IN 
FLORIDA. 
IN A MONDAY TWEET MR. TRUMP 
ENDORSED CONGRESSMAN RON 
DESANTOS PRAISING HIS RECORD ON 
CRIME AND BORDER SECURITY AND 
SAYING HE'S DONE A "INCREDIBLE 
JOB." 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS NOW. 
JOINING ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON 
IS WHITE HOUSE McCLATCHY 
CORRESPONDENT ANITA KUMAR AND 
WHITE HOUSE REPORTER ZEKE 
MILLER. 
BOTH FEEL FREE TO JUMP IN AS I 
THROW THESE QUESTIONS OUT, 
ALTHOUGH I'LL THROW THE FIRST 
QUESTION TO ANITA. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS WAITING AND WATCHING 
FOR IN TONIGHT'S PRIMARY 
ELECTIONS IN ARIZONA AND IN 
FLORIDA? 
>> Reporter:  THE PRESIDENT 
OBVIOUSLY IS LOOKING FOR HIS 
CANDIDATE, RON DESANTOS, TO WIN 
THE GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY THERE 
IN FLORIDA AND THIS IS SOMEONE 
HE SUPPORTED NUMEROUS TIMES, 
NOT JUST IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. 
HE ALSO DID AN EVENT FOR HIM. 
IN THE PRIMARY IN ARIZONA IT'S 
INTERESTING. 
THERE ARE THREE CANDIDATES 
RUNNING, THREE PRIMARY 
CANDIDATES ON THE REPUBLICAN 
SIDE, WHO ARE ALL TRYING TO SAY 
THAT THEY ARE THE TRUMP 
CANDIDATE. 
THEY'RE ALL ADVERTISING MAILERS 
AND TV ADS WITH DONALD TRUMP, 
BUT OBVIOUSLY HE IS NOT 
ENDORSED IN THAT ONE. 
>> ZEKE, ALL THE CANDIDATES IN 
THE ARIZONA SENATE RACE HAVE 
REALLY EMBRACED PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. 
SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO, OF COURSE, 
WAS PARDONED BY THE PRESIDENT, 
BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF HAS 
NOT MADE AN ENDORSEMENT. 
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? 
>> Reporter:  THERE ARE A 
COUPLE OF REASONS WHY AND IF 
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS 
PRIMARY RACE IN ARIZONA HASN'T 
BEEN SO MUCH A CAMPAIGN TO WIN, 
BUT FOR SOME OF THESE 
CANDIDATES, PARTICULARLY WARD 
AND ARPAIO, IT'S BEEN A 
CAMPAIGN REALLY FOR THE 
ENDORSEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT 
BECAUSE IN THAT THREE-WAY 
BATTLE THE ASSUMPTION HAS BEEN 
THAT ONE OR THE OTHER, THEY 
WERE CANNIBALIZING BOTH OF EACH 
OTHER THAT A PRESIDENTIAL 
ENDORSEMENT WOULD BOOST THEM 
OVER THE TOP AND THAT GETS TO 
WHY THE PRESIDENT HASN'T 
ENDORSED THERE WHILE ALL THREE 
ARE TRYING TO PUSH AND MAKE THE 
CASE THEY ARE THE MOST TRUMP 
CANDIDATE IN THE RACE, THE BEST 
CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN 
THE RACE. 
AGAIN ARIZONA IS A STATE, 
PARTICULARLY THE REPUBLICAN 
VOTERS IN ARIZONA, ARE VERY 
REPUBLICAN AND VERY SUPPORTIVE 
OF THE PRESIDENT. 
THE PRESIDENT'S ADVISORS HAVE 
TOLD HIM TO STAY OUT. 
DON'T ENDORSE ARPAIO. 
DON'T ENDORSE WARD. 
THAT WOULD ALMOST CERTAINLY 
POTENTIALLY DO SALLY WHO IS THE 
ESTABLISHED REPUBLICAN FAVORITE 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT GENERAL 
ELECTION MATCH-UPS OF THE FEW 
PUBLIC POLLS OUT THERE AND 
TALKING TO CONSULTANTS OF BOTH 
SIDES OF THE AISLE, THAT WOULD 
BE THE MOST COMPETITIVE MATCH-
UPS FOR REPUBLICANS IN A STATE 
THEY'VE VIEW VITAL TO MAINTAIN 
THEIR SENATE MAJORITY IN FALL. 
SO IF THE PRESIDENT WERE TO 
ENDORSE WARD OR ARPAIO, HE 
SEEMS MOST LIKELY TO WANT TO 
ENDORSE, IT COULD THROW THAT 
SEAT INTO JEOPARDY. 
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT'S 
AIDES HAVE REALLY BEEN MAKING A 
CASE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ENDORSE 
PEOPLE IN THESE OTHER RACES, 
BUT THIS IS THE ONE WHERE YOU 
JUST CAN'T WEIGH IN. 
>> I'M JUST WONDERING TO YOU 
BOTH IF THERE IS AT ALL A 
McCAIN FACTOR IN THERE, 
EVERYONE NOW DEALING WITH THE 
LOSS OF SENATOR JOHN McCAIN, 
SPEAKING ABOUT WHAT HE 
REPRESENTED AS A STATESMAN, 
WHAT HE REPRESENTED TO ARIZONA 
AND THE DIVISION BETWEEN McCAIN 
AND TRUMP IS ON FULL DISPLAY 
WITH THE PRESIDENT STILL NOT 
COMMENTING DIRECTLY ABOUT 
McCAIN'S PASSING. 
ANITA, IS THERE A McCAIN 
FACTOR, DO YOU THINK, IN 
PEOPLE'S MINDS HEADING TO THE 
POLLS? 
>> Reporter:  YEAH. 
I DEFINITELY DO, BUT I THINK 
THAT SORT OF THAT McCAIN/TRUMP 
FACTOR HAS BEEN AROUND FOR THE 
LAST COUPLE YEARS. 
I MEAN DONALD TRUMP TOOK OVER 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HE'S, 
YOU KNOW, STILL POPULAR WITH 
REPUBLICANS AND McCAIN HAD 
GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT MORE 
UNPOPULAR AS THIS PARTY HAS 
SPLIT BETWEEN THE MORE 
ESTABLISHMENT AND DONALD TRUMP 
AND SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO 
BE A FACTOR IN THAT STATE, BUT 
I THINK IT'S A FACTOR ALL OVER 
THE COUNTRY IN THESE ELECTIONS 
THAT ARE HAPPENING. 
I THINK ONE THING THAT ALSO IS 
A FACTOR IS THE PRESIDENT HAS 
TRIED AS MUCH AS HE CAN, AS 
DISCIPLINED AS HE IS OR 
UNDISCIPLINED SOMETIMES TO 
LISTEN TO MITCH McCONNELL, THE 
SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. 
IF HE'S REALLY BEEN PUSHED TO 
GET INVOLVED IN A RACE, I THINK 
HE'S TRIED TO LISTEN TO THAT, 
TRIED TO LISTEN TO HIM AND GET 
INVOLVED. 
HE EITHER GETS INVOLVED WITH 
WHAT MITCH McCONNELL WANTS OR 
HE STAYS OUT. 
SO THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE 
REASONS THAT YOU'RE SEEING HIM 
STAY OUT. 
>> ZEKE, DO YOU FEEL THERE'S A 
LEVEL OF THAT, TOO, THAT 
PERHAPS THE ADVICE PRESIDENT 
TRUMP IS GETTING IS TO STAY OUT 
OF THE ARIZONA PRIMARY AT THE 
MOMENT? 
IN SOME CIRCLES THEY DO 
CONSIDER THE PRESIDENT THE 
KINGMAKER CONSIDERING HIS HIGH 
POPULARITY WITHIN THE BASE. 
>> Reporter:  THAT'S EXACTLY 
RIGHT. 
I TALKED TO WHITE HOUSE 
OFFICIALS ABOUT THIS RACE OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS BECAUSE 
AS WE'VE BEEN WATCHING, WE SAW 
HIM ENDORSE FOSTER FRIESS IN 
WYOMING, A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE 
LAST WEEK MEANING THIS WOULD BE 
SORT OF THE NEXT OBVIOUS PLACE 
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO PUT HIS 
FINGER ON THE SCALE IN THAT 
PRIMARY. 
OFFICIALS SAY HE'S BEEN PRETTY 
DISCIPLINED AND THAT'S 
CERTAINLY NOT FOR ANY -- 
THERE'S BEEN A CONCERTED EFFORT 
BY THE WHITE HOUSE, POLITICAL 
OPERATION, PEOPLE AROUND THE 
PRESS, THE RNC, TO SORT OF 
EXPLAIN TO THE PRESIDENT TIME 
AND AGAIN WHY HE CAN'T ENDORSE 
HIM. 
YOU LOOK AT THE TACTICS 
PARTICULARLY ARPAIO AND WARD 
EMBRACED TO TAKE THEIR MESSAGE 
DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT 
WHETHER IT BE MENTIONING HIM ON 
TWITTER, TAKING TO FOX NEWS 
PROGRAMS THEY KNOW HE WATCHES 
OR MEDIA THEY KNOW -- THEY'RE 
TRYING TO GET AROUND THE 
FILTER, THE ORGANIZATION AROUND 
THE PRESIDENT TO GET HIM TO 
SORT OF GOAT HIM INTO WADING 
INTO THAT PRIMARY AND SO FAR 
AIDES SAY HE'S BEEN PRETTY 
DISCIPLINED. 
NOW WITH POLLS CLOSING IN A 
COUPLE OF HOURS HE HAS NOT 
TAKEN THE BAIT. 
>> I WANT TO DO A QUICK GUT 
CHECK WITH BOTH OF YOU BECAUSE 
I WANT TO SWITCH TO THIS OTHER 
TOPIC IN THE NEWS TODAY, 
PRESIDET TRUMP ATTACKING 
GOOGLE THIS MORNING ACCUSING 
THEM OF SUPPRESSING 
CONSERVATIVE VOICES. 
YOU HAD HIS CHIEF ECONOMIC 
ADVISOR LARRY KUDLOW SPEAKING 
TO REPORTERS AT THE WHITE HOUSE 
SAYING THAT THEY ARE LOOKING 
INTO IT. 
DO YOU BOTH BUY THIS AS A 
LEGITIMATE POSITION THE WHITE 
HOUSE IS TAKING OR IS THIS KIND 
OF MORE DISTRACT FROM McCAIN-
ISH BEHAVIOR? 
>> Reporter:  TIMES IT'S NOT, 
YOU KNOW, A WHITE HOUSE 
POSITION. 
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAPPENS TO SEE. 
HE MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY JUST 
GOOGLED HIMSELF AND WAS 
WONDERING WHAT WAS GOING ON. 
A LOT OF TIMES THINGS COMING 
OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ARE JUST 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT SEES 
SOMETHING AND HE WANTS TO KNOW 
WHAT'S GOING ON AND HIS AIDES 
NEED TO FOLLOW SUIT. 
I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. 
>> ANITA, DO YOU BELIEVE 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS REALLY 
GOOGLING HIMSELF OR IS THIS AN 
ADVISOR COMING TO HIM SAYING 
MAYBE THIS CAN GET THE BASE 
GOING? 
>> Reporter:  MAYBE HE'S TRYING 
TO DISTRACT OR APPEAL TO HIS 
BASE AND I THINK BOTH THOSE 
THINGS ARE PROBABLY TRUE AND IN 
SOME CASES I THINK IT PROBABLY 
IS WHAT IT SEEMS AT THE SAME 
TIME. 
IF IT COULD BE ALL THOSE 
THINGS, I THINK IT IS. 
OFTENTIMES HIS AIDES ARE CAUGHT 
UNAWARE WHAT'S GOING ON. 
IT'S SOMETHING HE HAPPENS TO 
SAY OR TWEET AND THEN SUDDENLY 
IT BECOMES SORT OF WHITE HOUSE 
POLICY THEY HAVE TO LOOK INTO. 
>> ZEKE, WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ON 
THIS? 
>> Reporter:  YEAH. 
IT CERTAINLY APPEARED TO BE THE 
SORT OF THING THAT WAS SORT OF 
PRESIDENT LED AND THEN STAFF 
DOING THE BACKFILLING TO TRY TO 
BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR WHAT 
THE PRESIDENT'S ARTICULATED, 
BUT IT IS INTERESTING. 
THE PRESIDENT ARTICULATING THAT 
COMPLAINT INTO LOOKING INTO 
SOME SORT OF REGULATION OF 
THESE INTERNET COMPANIES WHEN 
ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT 
DID WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE WAS 
ROLL BACK NET NEUTRALITY 
REGULATIONS. 
THE LACK OF CONSISTENCY THAT 
OFTEN FOLLOWS WHEN THE 
PRESIDENT IS ESSENTIALLY 
SETTING THE AGENDA FOR HIS 
ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT A WHOLE 
LOT OF FORETHOUGT AND 
CERTAINLY VERY LITTLE STAFF 
CONSULTATIONS THERE. 
THAT REALLY LEADS TO A LOT OF 
INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS THE 
ADMINISTRATION. 
>> GO AHEAD, ANITA. 
>> Reporter:  LET'S JUST 
REMEMBER THIS IS THE BACKDROP 
OF TWITTER AND FACEBOOK BEING 
IN THE NEWS FOR BEING ACCUSED 
OF, YOU KNOW, EXACTLY THE SAME 
THING. 
SO HE HAS SOMETHING TO SORT OF 
SAY HEY, LOOK AT THIS CONTEXT 
OF IT'S BEEN HAPPENING AND 
MAYBE WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT A 
LITTLE FURTHER. 
>> YOU HAD JACK DORSEY ADMIT TO 
TWITTER'S LEFT LEANING BIAS, IN 
FACT. 
A QUICK QUESTION TO YOU BOTH. 
WHEN IS THE LAST TIME YOU'VE 
GOOGLED YOURSELVES? 
TELL THE TRUTH. 
ZEKE? 
COME ON. 
>> Reporter:  I DID JUST 
YESTERDAY. 
>> AND ANITA? 
>> Reporter:  I WAS LOOKING FOR 
AN OLD STORY I WROTE. 
>> Reporter:  YEAH. 
THAT'S BASICALLY IT. 
I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED UP STORIES 
THAT I'VE WRITTEN. 
>> THE TYPICAL REPORTERS' 
EXCUSE. 
I, TOO, DID IT YESTERDAY. 
A FINAL QUESTION TO YOU BOTH. 
WE HAD THIS NEW REPORT RELEASED 
TODAY FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON 
UNIVERSITY FINDING THAT NEARLY 
3,000 PEOPLE DIED IN HURRICANE 
MARIA. 
YOU HAD GOVERNOR RICARDO 
ROSSELLO ADJUSTING THE DEATH 
TOLL FROM 64 ALL THE WAY UP TO 
2,975. 
IT MAKES IT THE DEADLIEST STORM 
FOR AMERICANS IN MORE THAN A 
CENTURY. 
I QUICKLY WANT TO HAVE YOU BOTH 
LISTEN TO AN INTERVIEW MY 
COLLEAGUE DAVID BEGNAUD HAD 
WITH SAN JUAN'S MAYOR JUST A 
SHORT TIME AGO. 
>> THIS IS NOT A NUMBER. 
IT'S NOT 2,975. 
THAT NUMBER IS JUST THE AMOUNT 
OF TIMES THERE WAS NEGLECT. 
IT'S JUST THE AMOUNT OF TIMES 
THAT SOMEBODY TURNED THE OTHER 
CHEEK. 
IT WAS THE AMOUNT OF TIMES THAT 
THIS GOVERNMENT AND THE 
MAJORITY OF THE POLITICAL CLASS 
IN PUERTO RICO DECIDED TO PLAY 
BY DONALD TRUMP AND DANCE TO 
HIS TUNE RATHER THAN TO SPEAK 
UP WHAT YOU WERE SEEING, WHAT 
EVERYONE WHO CAME TO PUERTO 
RICO WAS SEEING, WHAT WE WERE 
SEEING THAT PEOPLE WERE DYING. 
>> THE STORM A DISASTER, THE 
AFTERMATH EVEN MORE SO AND IT 
IS NOW BEING CONFIRMED IN STUDY 
AFTER STUDY. 
CAN THE WHITE HOUSE STAY SILENT 
ABOUT THIS? 
IF NOT, WHAT SHOULD IT BE
