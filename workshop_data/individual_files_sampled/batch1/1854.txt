the Palestinian president has urged to suspend recognition of Israel it's a further expression of Palestinian anger following Donald Trump's decision on Jerusalem but one of the consequences of cutting ties with Israel and the Palestinians have alternative options verses inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Elizabeth puranam Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called Donald Trump's peace efforts for slap of the century and promised a slap back now the Palestinian Liberation Organization has outlined its strategy to face the u.s. president's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital the core demands are to suspend Palestinian recognition of Israel and to no longer regard the US as a partner for peace we'll discuss the implications with our guests in a moment but first in rankin reports from the occupied West Bank late on Monday night the Palestinian leadership issued a statement that could have far-reaching consequences for the peace process the statement includes the call to suspend recognition of Israel suspend security coordination with it and unite the Palestinian factions through reconciliation the statement comes from the Central Council of the PLO after two days of meetings it will be discussed further by the PLO Executive Committee and is up to that committee to implement the most policy at some point in the future the statement also said that the u.s. is no longer a partner for peace and that the Palestinians want international involvement but given that the u.s. is perhaps the only country that can put pressure on Israel will this work we have to utilize different forms of accountability for result it has to know that this occupation this form of brutal colonialism can no longer be accepted and therefore we have to go to the International Criminal Court we have to go to the International Court of Justice we have to join organizations and accede to charters and conventions that would protect us on the one hand and hold Israel to account the US president Donald Trump has said he will cut USA to the Palestinians if that happens there will be an economic impact this factory produces extract of olive leaf tablets and is part of a multi-million dollar project to encourage enterprise in Jericho the occupied West Bank the factory was set up in this industrial zone were Japanese investment without it it wouldn't been successful for the operations manager here it shows that there are alternatives to the US for example the Japanese lots of other governments they showed interest in helping the Palestinians economy ladies are lots of other options once it's complete this Japanese funded industrial zone will house around 5,000 workers and that's going to have a positive impact not just here locally but across the Palestinian territories now if you speak to Palestinians what they'll tell you is oftentimes foreign aid unlike US aid comes without strings and preconditions but it's not just economics politics also plays a key role according to one analyst Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has options he's trying to tell the international community that I will be going to the United Nations time after time and he's trying to say that I will have I will be patient I will stop looking for a two-state solutions if you are not really positive that Israel despite Palestinian confidence that there is an alternative to u.s. involvement in the peace process how the international community will react is key at some point the Israelis and the Palestinians will need some sort of framework for talks without the u.s. what that will look like is currently unknown Imran Khan al Jazeera occupied West Bank well let's bring in our guests now joining us via Skype from Nablus in the West Bank abdul Sattar Kassim professor of political science and columnist for Middle East monitor in Tel Aviv Yossi Beilin former Israeli cabinet minister and in Paris and Voula gibreel professor of communication at the University of Miami welcome to you all mr. Qasim the PLO Central Council has said that they do not recognize the State of Israel you have watched Palestinian politics for a very long time is this an indication of just how bad things are things are so bad and probably you need to ask the people in the street how bad it is they are suffering a lot all the time but when you have the PLO Central Council did not say that they don't recognize Israel but they have been talking about a temporary withdrawal of recognition until Israel recognizes the State of Palestine and stops the settlement activities in other words they cut the council the Central Committee is still recognizing Israel conditionally and that's not even acceptable by the Palestinians the Palestinians were hoping that their PL o will withdraw completely its recognition of Israel because this recognition has not brought us anything profitable and on the contrary we have been suffering because of the negotiations process and because of the false and fake promises of the United States mr. Bri let me go to you and pick up on what mr. Carson is saying just how realistic is a complete withdrawal from the peace process that has that started with Oslo in 1993 with no longer recognizing Israel given the reality on the ground the cooperation between Israel and Palestinian entities in running the Palestinian territories I don't think the the PLO was mentioning or even the president of recognizing Israel its recognizing the leadership of Bibi Netanyahu as a as a viable partner her piece de facto the peace process is dead it's been dead for a while it's now to recognize the reality on the ground and formulate new paradigm this leadership the Palestinian Authority led by Mahmoud Abbas has failed spectacularly they'll promise the Palestinian sovereignty equality and freedom none of these things has been delivered ever the peace process was there for the sake of peace for the peace process it was a fake leave the settlement activity continued the colonization activity continued we are looking at a one-state reality it's a bi-national state it's an apartheid state this is what former prime minister hood Olmert and a hood Barak actually said that Israel is today Israel is an ethno-religious project of purity and exclusion we have as Palestinians and as Israeli we have to look at reality as is not as our leaders are stating that they would love it to be the truth is now the Palestinian national movement needs to formulate a new vision a new and also open the door our bus is 82 I think for it's time for him to acknowledge his failure and for him to open the door for new leaders for new ideas and a new vision look yesterday was the day of Martin Luther King the Israeli Declaration of Independence talked about equal rights for all inhabitants regardless their ethnicity their gender and their religion it's time to acknowledge that Israel control the whole territory between the sea and the river even the ambassador of America in Israel Friedman who is somebody who financed settlement activity talked about lifting the term occupation never use it because this is the whole land is the Land of Israel it's time to acknowledge that the population that lives there deserve equal rights as the Declaration of Independence at of Israel called for and this is why mr. Abbas said that he would not actually meet with mr. Friedman because he doesn't even want the use of the word occupation by the Americans mr. Berlin if I can bring you in now how do you think that Israeli finance activity yeah how do you think the Israelis and the Israeli government will be looking on at what's come out of this PLO Central Council meeting we have heard from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that actually muckle with Abbas has only served Israel's interests he said that he exposed what we have been saying all the time that the root of the conflict is the basic refusal to recognize a Jewish state in any borders I mean did mr. Abbas a speech and recommendations play into Benjamin Netanyahu's hands well we are having a very rightist government in Israel the most rightist one if this government doesn't believe in real agreement with the Palestinians there are theoretically our for peace but without paying the price for peace as a result of it what the government spokesmen are saying all the time is that it is not a territorial issue not even on Jerusalem not even the number of refugees or exactly the border but it is something which is perhaps religious or perhaps very very a far distance in its origin and it cannot be solved by just sitting together and having something like the Clinton parameters or the Geneva initiative now but by what is what was said about the Balfour Declaration in the past and and about 48 and whatever in the eyes of Netanyahu is strengthening the feeling that it is insoluble if it is insoluble then you don't have to do anything of course I cannot agree with something like that but I believe that that Mahmoud Abbas President Abbas a missed the point in his speech rather than saying something very very concrete like after 25 years I decide to dissolve the Palestinian Authority which I believe is time is timely well something which could be very very concrete like even the idea that if nothing is happening right now we should now work very seriously on the option of one-person one-vote of course many Israelis would not would like to do whatever possibly in order to prevent it and it might edge in negotiations right now the situation is quite convenient for the current Israeli government and I don't think that neither the the speech of yet of the other day of a Presidente Abbas no the resolutions of the a council changing something for the current government well let's look at how we have got to this point despite many peace plans over the years little progress has been made among the main sticking points Israeli leaders say Jerusalem is the indivisible capital of Israel Palestinian leaders won't occupied East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state Palestinians demand the borders of their new state includes the occupied West Bank occupied East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip Israeli leaders insist most of those areas should be part of Israel another major stumbling block the right of return for around five million Palestinian refugees scattered all over the world all their families fled in 1948 when Israel was created Israel refuses to support the return of any of them mr. abdul Sattar Kasim will here we are now yoson Baylin was saying that this was something of even a missed opportunity by Mahmoud Abbas that these recommendations are not concrete enough so what does the PLO need to do now they are not concrete enough that's true because they do not meet the aspirations of the Palestinians we want complete withdrawal from Oslo Accords and we should withdraw the recognition shame and we should be back to armed resistance against the Israelis we should understand that the Israelis are not occupying us with roses and the flowers they are occupying us with American and war planes coming from the United States they are using force against us to maintain their own occupation of our land and that is by definition terrorism if we want to talk about international terrorism Israel is a leader of international terrorism and it's backed by the United States so we should defend ourselves and we should defend our rights our rights are of two major points first the return of the refugees there are millions of Palestinian refugees who should be back to their homes and property until now the international community represented by the United States has not been talking about this basic human rights no mr. Carson anyone is second yes and you are bringing yes you are dressing up the issues that have been this you know the the main sticking points where there has been no progress on mr. Beale if I can bring you in now who can defend the rights of Palestinians in this conflict now that they no longer want to deal with the United States look Palestinians are fighting for their existence and continuation as a nation no doubt this is a critical moment for the Palestinian history and the Palestinian people they've been abandoned by the Arab most alert Arab leaders starting with Saudi Arabia they're abandoned by Saudi Arabia and Arab countries are focused on something else it's not a main issue as I think Bahraini the Bahraini foreign minister tweeted it's a side issue Americans are 100% Pro Bibi Netanyahu not even Pro the Israelis where the majority is not the majority there's a camp that Yossi Beilin talks about and talked - which one's actually a democratic Israeli state with equality maybe for all or at least a federation a confederation the Palestinians need to seek protection from the international community I think the balance are that this balance of power is in Israel favor whether it's economically or militarily we cannot think back that we cannot roll back these 25 years however I truly believe exactly like the rest of the world exactly like South Africa or the African American community in America the the civil right movement starts now and started the moment Bibi Netanyahu started rebuilding settlements and making the settlement Center for his policy and policies of segregation and discrimination America has elected the first African American president and President Obama this is what democracy is about its rule to be rule and rule in turn its participation it's one man one vote and I believe this is where the conflict needs to be and where the struggle needs to start Israelis especially like people like Yossi Beilin and others need to start fighting for the Democratic soul of their government and of their country otherwise we are looking at an extreme religious right-wing that wants purity and exclusion even of people from people like mr. Balin who is a liberal and a real Democrat mr. Balin I do want to bring you in here because I ask truly gibreel who could be an alternative to the US as a mediator in peace talks and we talked about who can no longer play that role and I guess that's one of the big problems in this peace process is who can replace the u.s. which is no longer seen as an honest broker mr. brill spoke of you know arab states who have who are not championing the palestinian cause like they might once have mahmoud abbas did speak about you know possible alternatives the Arab initiative the roadmap but do you think Israel would be interest in these initiatives where there is where they get a normalizing of ties from Arab states when that seems to be happening anyway somewhat behind the scenes because their ally the United States wants Arab Gulf states in the region to normalize ties with Israel yeah but there is no a secret normalization normalization is normalization with with tourism and culture and whatever what we are having there today is the status of a concubine I mean Israel has undoubtedly some some nono some of them a little bit known a connections with the leadership in the Arab world but not with the Arab world itself and it is not normalization in my view but if we're speaking about who might defend the the Palestinians not not by asking them to begin out terrorism it will bring them nowhere or bringing here five million refugees then it is of course the end of Israel for Israelis like myself the issue of the refugees should be solved but not in that in that way at the end of the day my belief is that what we have to do is to defend each other that the peace camp in Israel which is big it is not a marginal one and the peace camp in Palestine which is also big should help each other I mean we went to Oslo without the Americans or the Europeans or anybody the Norwegians well facilitators that's all they went out of the room when we negotiated we negotiated with Jordan without President Clinton without the Americans they all helped us eventually with with financial as assistant and whatever but not in the initiative and not in the negotiations we don't need a kind of help from the parents in order to sit together we know each other well we can talk to each other if we really want peace those of us who do know will always find excuses why not to sit together yeah and of course the issue of leadership regretfully on both sides is something which has to be tackled mr. brill I can see you wanting to come in yes Yosi I'm sorry to say we had consecutive government on the left and on the right on Israel however none of them implemented really the promises of the Oslo agreement it failed we need to acknowledge that it's a failed process 25 years after we have more settlements more enriched occupation it's time to look at the reality we are one state a bi-national state it's an apartheid state it's now - call it for what it is and not pretend that it's something else whenever a bus is saying he is 8 year old he is declared actually his failure by saying what he said it's not to create a new paradigm I agree with you that but the peace camp in Israel the labor camp that campaigned where the leader of the that camp in the last election said we are not the one that loved Arabs we actually agree with most of these policies that Bibi Netanyahu is enacting in the West Bank in the occupied territories in Gaza so you have an issue inside Israel where the right wing is cannibalizing all the ideas and basically winning over and again so we need to decide that this civil right movement must start with Israelis and Palestinian progressive Israelis but you still have this entrench racism and bigotry inside even the left camp and we need to speak about it in a clear-cut way exactly like American are speaking about their president as a racist president calling him out your camp needs to come out and call out ill these racist laws that are enacted against even Palestinians with an Israeli passport mr. Casten let me bring you in now what do you make of miss what mr. Brean has saying you know what can the Palestinians what can the PLO what can muffin with Abbas achieve now when what the politics of Israel as they are now Mahmoud Abbas doesn't have any legal status his mandate ended in 2009 he is our objective it does not represent the Palestinians they should leave that will take his path who do you think should take his place now if he wants it there should there should be democratic elections but these guys do not believe in democracy Mahmoud Abbas and all of this court do not believe in democracy they should leave they have failed they haven't achieved anything for the Palestinians over 25 years and we are really fed up with the situation they have been a complete failure and we should elect a new leaders that's the way it should be done and how likely do you think that is mr. Carsen because there has been talk of elections for a long time now we know they are long overdue there's also a lot of talk of you know reconciliation between the main Palestinian factions and yet Hamas Islamic Jihad did not turn up to this PLO central council meeting before the Palestinians can deal with Israel and the international community do they have their house in order did the right thing they are not members in the PLO and why they should go to the meeting of the Central Council and its main English to attend that that meeting and you you you say that the resolution series by the Central Council do not respond to that Palestinian demands I understand what you're saying we only have a minute left in the program and I would like to ask our other guests a very quick question mr. Baily and the reality on the ground Israel will have to be part of the solution how do you get the Israeli political system to accept the resolutions being proposed well I believe that we are not far from changing our government the government today the coalition today is not a very strong one it's it's it's based on very few members of necessity and I hope that in the next elections the the center-left will win it and parties like my party merits it will be part of such a coalition and they will will actually do whatever they can in order to go back to get back to the negotiating table we know the solutions we don't have to begin from from zero from scratch well thank you to all our guests up the SATA chasm and Nablus Yossi Beilin and Tel Aviv and religion burial in Paris and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website al-jazeera calm and for further discussion go to our Facebook page at facebook.com forward slash AJ Inside Story you can also join the conversation on twitter our handle is at aj inside story from the elizabeth puranam the whole team here bye for now you
