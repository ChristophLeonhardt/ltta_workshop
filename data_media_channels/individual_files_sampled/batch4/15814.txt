Twitter and social media it's like life there's the best and the worst of humanity on it so you shouldn't take it too seriously when you see awful things on Facebook I'm gonna tell you about a tweet on Twitter about the horrific highway crash that killed 16 people on the Humboldt Broncos hockey team last week I'll tell you in a moment but first just to recap that story there's so much grief such young beautiful people men and women actually including one of the female sports therapists on the bus they were from different backgrounds in life it's something more from Alberta actually some of the hockey players were Aboriginal of course it was just young people loving life loving Canada's national sport loving being a team together hoping for the future and then a shocking tragedy what can you do except grieve what are you gonna do what people wanted to do something so one woman set up a GoFundMe crowdfunding page to help raise money for the families to cover expenses to cover Hospital costs for the injured survivors I'm not sure exactly what all the money is for but I am absolutely sure that it will be needed Canadians saw this and they saw that it was a legitimate fund and so they gave as a symbol of unity I think it was beautiful really don't you think the best of humanity brought out through social media it is rare but that can happen well I want to talk to you about the worst side of people that social media can bring out to that tweet I mentioned it's from a left-wing activist journalist named Nora Loreto again Twitter is full of people from the best of the worst she's the worst she said this she posted a picture of the GoFundMe page and said this is a lot of money which is true you know and you could leave it at that or you could even chip in a bit yourself or you can stop being weird and voyeuristic about it but yeah it's a lot of money that represents Canadians trying to do some tangible thing to help those hurting the most but yeah it's a lot of money but then she wrote this I'm trying not to get cynical about what is a totally devastating tragedy but the maleness the youthful and the whiteness of the victims are of course playing a significant role I'm sorry pardon me to say what the bodies were not yet buried yet the families were crying the the community was agonizing and this weirdo wants to turn it into a feminist racialist moment she's angry that people are so generous and she thinks it's not because of the horrific tragedy but rather an expression an expression of racism and sexism is that what you see when you look at this you don't see pain of humans just people Canadians you immediately put those people those human beings those Canadians in a little boxes this race or that this sex or that is that what you do it's a hockey team so of course it's gonna be young it's a men's hockey team so it's cause they're gonna be male and she's wrong by the way that there were Aboriginal members of the team and I mentioned there was a young woman killed too does that make her feel better does she want gender and race quotas in this tragedy she's so obsessed with that what a freak what a monster look at the bottom of her tweet the number on the right is the people who like the tweet just over 400 fellow creeps the number in the middle is people who retweeted it that has republished it to their own followers just over 150 but look at the number on the left more than 4,000 people replied to her tweet overwhelmingly calling her out not just for being racist and sexist and creepy but just for being so cruel you'd think that's when someone would say sorry or even sorry too soon or even I believe what I said but I was inconsiderate no no she's digging in not just digging in she's turned herself into the real victim of the humble tragedy this was actually the big breakthrough she needed she wanted attention that's what she was after oh and she got it she wasn't about to be contrite and back down and apologized or even just shut up she had succeeded in becoming relevant to a big cultural moment in Canada she managed to put herself in the story about the humble Broncos as a victim she was finally as somebody even if she had to crawl over dead bodies to do it we just scroll through all her tweets about it she wrote about herself and and reiterated a dozen times here's one of them she said thanks to everyone for the support I have so much to say about how the far-right manufacturers hate online and all I can say is Wow no one deserves this even if what day something dos respectful which by the way I didn't even so she's stupid too right um but what she said there she said the far-right manufacturers hate online what's what's right-wing or left-wing got got to do with this it's not right-wing or left-wing she's smeared the dad and their families saying they didn't deserve the help they were getting or something weird like that and then she's pleading that she's the victim of hate she's the real victim here that the right-wing manufactured you read her original tweet she's the author of her own fiasco that she absolutely loves and his milking I showed you all the tweets that she did thereafter who is this Nora Louie no I mean why am I talking about some loser on Twitter there are 300 million people on Twitter two billion on Facebook why should we care about any one of them I mean she's got about 7,000 followers on Twitter for comparison I have about 120,000 and I'm not that big a deal on Twitter my point is why would I focus on someone so obscure who made a grotesque comment online I mean you do that you know you'll be doing that forever it's that sort of like walking downtown maybe a dress in the suit you're looking you're Bassett and let's say there's some drunk hobo in the alley who's out at you with a profanity you wouldn't stop and debate that drunk you wouldn't even reply to them you'd keep on walking you wouldn't indulge them so why would we indulge this disgraceful woman well because that drunk profane hobo isn't a nobody actually in this case she's a somebody actually sure she's gross but she's a gross somebody she was a Students Union president about a decade ago steeped in all the postmodern crap and political correctness and Marxism he's just a short sample of that hi my name is Nora Loreto and and I guess this is my submission for a candidate's next great prime minister I am currently in the working Student Center office at Ryerson University the Ryerson Students Heon we do a lot of social justice work here make education free it is a right the title of that video by the way was why I want to be prime minister so gross she finally graduated and she kept up the extremism in real life after University blending socialism with racism here she is in front of a Marxist banner that says a system in crisis Marxism 2014 she's so far off the NDP's and left-wing in that for her can you believe that she actually campaigned for a party in Quebec called Quebec solidaire they're a mix of Marxism and pro Islam extremism that's her beat and she's actually on the executive of uniform that big labor union she's on the executive of their Canadian freelance Union which is an attempt to unionize journalists who don't have permanent jobs so if you're a working man or woman in Canada in a union she's your spokesman that your union dues it worked how do you feel about that he's part of uniform but still I mean so far who cares right I mean the fact that you have a gross leftist in student politics and then Quebec radical politics and they're propped up by a labor union none of that is really surprising right and anyone who's glimpsed at life on campus lately or just listen to five minutes of Jordan Peterson the great professor from U of T you know how toxic campus culture is so so that's not news still so here's my point she is not just a marginal monster she's in the heart of mainstream media culture in Canada and is still today she's a star and Maclean's magazine here's her peace doing her pro Islam race Huck stirring about the mass shooting in Quebec City that police and prosecutors said had nothing to do with Islamophobia well not to her it's proof we're all racist she's a regular at an unreadable obscure magazine called The Walrus unreadable but sort of mainstream in that they're subsidized by Trudeau's Liberal government of course they are issues of the pages of The Globe and Mail Canada's national newspaper if they do say so themselves and so I'm coming to my point now my problem with Nora Loreto it's not that she's gross or racist or sexist or Marxist or a bit of a monster for trying to make the humble tragedy about her trying to take away the victimhood from the dead and their families and wear it around her own neck like she's the victim my problem isn't that she's foul when this part of humanity and you can't legislate against that you can't ban that you don't want to ban that because freedom includes the freedom to be that grotesque my point is that Canada's mainstream media the scolding censoring fainting couch mainstream media who marginalize and D platform and ban anyone who merely breathes a word of dissent about any genuine controversy the same media political industrial complex that tries to get any dissident on issues of let's say transgenderism or Islam to get that person either fired from their jobs or banned from social media or even prosecuted for a hate crime the same thin-skinned crybabies who want to legally ban Islamophobia as if that's a thing they're just fine with this gross gross woman because she's on the left and because she attacked men and white people and Saskatchewan and hockey and national pride and common Canadian purpose I mean I've told you before about rebel derangement syndrome how the mainstream media just won't stop obsessing over how we here at the rebel was just awful that we're even allowed to exist I mean remember when men when they medley interviewed Jordan Peterson the other day like I say best-selling journalist in the world right now her first question to him her first question was why hasn't he disassociated himself from us speaking out against the the federal bill c16 of gender pronouns and so on the federal government cut your funding for research rebel media came in and did a crowdfunding project for you raise about $200,000 after Charlottesville and the riots of protests there many people cut ties with rebel media including the conservative leader Andrew Shearer saying that it could be seen as giving hate groups a platform you still go on there so I'm wondering why do you go on rebel media after after Charlottesville she's obsessed with scolding us D platforming us spearing us it's really quite weird I won't show you all the other examples right now well here's one of Nora Leary hos loving appearances on the CBC to work together for a common political or so there's no call for her to be blacklisted blackballed thrown out marginalized banned from all these different media's she was on The Globe and Mail The Walrus Maclean's the state broadcaster for which Wendy menace leaf works I mean a few people on Twitter is saying that but there's no concerted effort to get her band or criminalized there's no political hygiene for the nor Lurie toes of the world either from the general public or more importantly from within those media companies I've listened the cleans the globe the CBC unifor the Union Quebec solidaire and Twitter itself of course they're just fine with nor Laurita they're actually fine with what she said not how she said it of course she was too blunt too rude she said it too soon she made herself too easy to criticize but hating Canadian culture I mean actual Canadian culture like like a busload of kids in Saskatchewan going out to play hockey and then Canadians supporting their grieving families with private donations yeah they all hate that culture just as much as Nora Loreto does she's gross I would wash my hands if I ever shook hers but she's just an example a symptom of the problem our media political culture please tell me any important ways that it's any different from Nora Loreto she she's just wendy ms lee without all the plastic surgery isn't she that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one
