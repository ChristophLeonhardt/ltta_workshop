I just spoke to Tommy Robinson he called me and told me the news they're trying to send them back to prison next month here are the details you know it's just last week Tommy won his stunning court of appeal victory so many people were jubilant and the elite media were furious justice was served Tommy was vindicated when he was let out of prison I met with him and his family and I had a hug and handshake we paid the last of his legal bills and then we shut down our crowdfunding campaign we were done I came back to Canada Tommy went away with his family for two weeks of quiet personal time to reconnect with them mission accomplished that felt pretty good thank you for helping but now Tommy called me what why would he do that he should be spending time with his family not talking to me well he had bad news first he tells me he's been unwell you saw how he was abused in prison they starved him he lost 40 pounds a weight they refused his request to let him even buy more food they did not give him any medical care in prison since he's been out he's been to the hospital twice already he'll get better eventually but they tortured him in prison physically and psychologically a man's not meant to be in solitary confinement locked in a small cage 23 and a half hours a day for two solid months with Muslim prison gangs being allowed to come right up to his cell shouting violent threats at him literally pushing their own human excrement through his prison window all the while he's living on just a can of tuna and a piece of fruit a day only two visits the entire time from his family that's what the prison officials ordered be done to Tommy that's not the worst of it Tommy tells me that the UK government insists on proceeding against him in criminal court a second time you thought they were done with him they want to put him through another trial for the same thing for his facebook livestream that day back in May in Leeds the one that spent two months in solitary confinement for an improper and illegal sentence according to the court of appeal they want to do it to him all over again they want to put him in prison again I am sorry but that will kill him you saw him after 2 months in solitary confinement now imagine him after 13 months they've already scheduled the next trial September 4th at Old Bailey that's the main Criminal Court in London Tommy should never have served a day in prison no British journalist has been imprisoned for contempt of court since the 1940s they want him to serve even more time now they want to go at him again I should tell you and let me be very clear on this the UK government does not have to do this in fact they've never sent a journalist to prison for contempt of court since the 40s the leading contempt of court case in the United Kingdom the leading legal precedent a judgement written by Lord Justice Brian Levin himself the head criminal judge in the UK he says you don't have to do that you don't even have to retry someone for contempt when it's thrown out for procedural reasons has happened to Tommy let me tell you about this important legal precedent for one minute and look at the double standard as it's applied to Tommy Robinson in this leading case there was a lawyer named Ian Stuart West who is in his outrageous conduct in court there was in court arguing with the judge insulting the judge and then he refused to show up in court when the judge ordered him to do so and he quarreled with the judge he was abusive to the judge and then I can't even believe this this lawyer Ian Stewart West stood there in the court and demanded that the judge apologised to him that judge later wrote and I quote I thought your behavior was appalling in open court I think leaving court when you were required here in the afternoon was monstrous appalling and monstrous later on judge Bryan Lipson of the Court of Appeal called it and I quote willful and deliberate disobedience of an order of the court as an act of defiance which is serious misconduct unquote so what happened to this guy he paid a fine of a few hundred pounds but then he appealed and the Court of Appeal quashed that verdict like they did for Tommy saying it was procedurally flawed like they said for Tommy but they decided that Ian Stuart West didn't have to go back for a second hearing he was done no fine no prison he could go monstrous and appalling the tummy who just improperly spent two months in solitary confinement he has to go back to court again and likely back to prison again Tommy has lost 40 pounds from starvation in prison he is unwell he did not deliberately undermine the courts like Ian Stuart West did he immediately offered to take down his Facebook live stream when asked he cooperated he didn't even know he was breaking the rules in the first place he didn't shout back at the judge like Ian Stuart West did Ian Stuart West was free to go but Tommy Robinson has to go back to court so Tommy called me and asked me to help him one more time and I told him I would he said he needs to pay for the lawyers again I've talked to the lawyers and so we've started up saved Tommy calm the crowdfunding page again because we have to pay for them to prepare for another hearing now we have to pay to do this bloody thing all over again can you please go to save Tommy calm to help please do why is this happening at all as Tommy not served enough time in prison for being a journalist last month I met the new Attorney General of the United Kingdom Geoffrey cogs did I tell you that I met him the day he was sworn in in court I went right up to him and I shook his hand and I asked him about Tony Robinson and Tommy's treatment in prison now Cox said he had been too busy preparing for his new position of attorney-general to get caught up on the news about Tommy okay fair enough but he surely had a chance to get it caught up by now so we have a petition now please sign the petition at save Tommy calm it's to Geoffrey Cox the Attorney General telling him to stop treating Tommy Robinson like a political prisoner in a banana republic we will personally deliver this petition to the Attorney General's Office in London demanding that this abuse of Tommy Robinson be stopped that this endless harassment be stopped the Court of Appeal said that Tommy Robinson was wrongly convicted and wrongly sentenced he should not be subjected to a second round of punishment for the same thing the United Kingdom us stop it's disgraceful treatment of a man who is clearly being treated as a political prisoner and who has been tortured while in Her Majesty's prisons go to save Tommy calm Tommy has asked for my help one more time so I'll do it and I need your help he's not well he's not yet fed they wrecked him
