>> Harris: FOX NEWS ALERT,
FORMER TRUMP CAMPAIGN ADVISOR
GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS IS ON
CAPITOL HILL TODAY.
HERE'S THERE FOR A CLOSED-DOOR
INTERVIEW BEFORE A WHITE HOUSE
PANEL.
THIS COMES NEARLY ONE YEAR AFTER
HE BECAME VERY FUSED PERSON TO
PLEAD GUILTY TO THE MUELLER
PROBE.
PUBLICANS ARE HOPING HE CAN
BOLSTER THEIR CASE REGARDING
POETICAL BIAS IN THE RUN-UP TO
THE TRUMP-RUSH INVESTIGATION.
DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING TO PRESS
HIM ON HIS MEDICATIONS WITH THE
FORMER FOREIGN PROFESSOR WHO
TOLD PAPADOPOULOS IN 2016 THAT
RUSSIANS HAD DRIVEN
HILLARY CLINTON.
THE FORM OF THOUSANDS OF TAX
EMAILS.
PAPADOPOULOS HAS RECENTLY BEEN
APPLYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT HE
WAS SET UP.
HERE'S MARK MEADOWS ON WHAT HE'S
HOPING TO LEARN TODAY.
>> OBVIOUSLY, GEORGE
PAPADOPOULOS WAS THE REASON WHY
THIS WHOLE RUSH INVESTIGATION
WAS OPENED.
IT WAS A PREDICATE FOR THE
AFFAIR.
HOPEFULLY WE WILL LEARN TODAY
EXACTLY WHAT WAS SAID, WHAT WAS
NOT SAID.
I THINK WHAT WE WILL FIND IS
THAT THIS WAS NOT SOMEONE WHO
WAS COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA.
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.
>> Jason: THE QUESTIONING WILL
BE OF BLOOD ON THE SIDE BY
RATCLIFF OUT OF TEXAS.
THERE WILL BE OTHERS IN THE ROOM
AS WELL.
THIS IS A BETTER SETTING TO DO
THIS, BECAUSE YOU CAN GO FOR ONE
HOUR EACH SIDE.
UNLIKE THE 5 MINUTES TO GET IN
THE PUBLIC PREVIEW GO ONE HOUR.
THE DEMOCRATS, WHEN OUR THIRD
REPUBLICANS, VICE VERSA.
YOU CAN CONTINUE AS LONG AS YOU
WANT.
THAT'S WHY SOMETIMES THESE
THINGS GO FOR EIGHT OR NINE
HOURS.
ALL THE PROCEDURAL YOURSELF THAT
HAPPENS.
THE TIMELINE IS ONE OF THE KEY
THINGS, HERE.
OFFICIALS TRYING TO CLAIM THAT
THIS STARTED AT THIS DATE IN
JULY, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT
SUGGESTS THAT IS WRONG.
REALLY WRONG.
THE QUESTIONING WILL BE, IN
PART, BUT WHAT DID HE SAY AND
NOT SAY.
IT'S NOT TRYING TO REHASH
WHETHER OR NOT HE LIED TO
FEDERAL OFFICIALS, WHICH HE
EVIDENTLY DID AND HAS DONE
SOMETIME BEFORE.
WHAT WAS THE TIMELINE LIKE?
WHY ARE THERE OTHER PEOPLE THAT
WERE ENGAGING WITH HIM TO
POTENTIALLY SET HIM UP AND THEN
JUSTIFY THIS FISA APPLICATION?
>> Melissa: WHY DOES IT MATTER
IF IT'S EARLIER?
>> Jason: THIS IS CUTE WITH
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S LOOKING
AT.
HE DOES THIS REPORT AND SAYS "I
FIND NO IMPETUS TO AFFECT WHAT
THEY DID, BASED ON BIAS."
BUT WHAT YOU CAN LOOK AT IS, DID
THE SAME FBI OFFICIALS USE TIME?
DID THEY USE RESOURCES?
DID THEY SPEND MONEY?
DID THEY PAY INFORMANTS?
WHY DID THEY DO THAT?
THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN THAT
THEY WERE TARGETING A POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN AND DONALD TRUMP, AS
OPPOSED TO FOLLOWING THE LEADS
BASED ON INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAY
HAVE, YOU KNOW, ENCOMPASS THIS
PERSON OR NOT.
THAT'S WHY THE TIMELINE --
BECAUSE PETER STRZOK, IN
PARTICULAR, STARTED SPENDING
TIME IN MAKING RESOURCES AND
SENDING THESE TEXT MESSAGES THAT
THEY CAN COMPARE THE TIMELINES.
>> Melissa: BEFORE ANY WHY
DIDN'T HE THINK I'M IS WHAT
YOU'RE SAYING.
BEFORE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS, THEY
WERE ALREADY --
>> Jason: BEFORE THEY HAD
EVIDENCE, WHERE THE ALLOCATING
RESOURCES TO TRY AND DO THIS?
IS THE QUESTION.
SPEAKER IT'S INTERESTING,
BECAUSE A LOOK AT BEST AND
THINK, WHAT WOULD SOME
OPERATIVES ON HILLARY CLINTON'S
CAMPAIGNS, WHAT HAS     WHERE TA
CAMPAIGNS, WHAT HAS     WHERE TE
DONE?
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN THIS COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT
TO WANT TO MAKE YOUR BOSS HAPPY.
WHO WANTED TO LIVE OR SOMETHING,
UNFORTUNATELY, WITH BOTH SIDES.
THEY REACHED INTO INTERNATIONAL
FILTH IN ORDER TO GET OPPOSITION
RESEARCH ON THEIR OPPONENTS.
WAS GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS GOADED
INTO BREAKING THE LAW, OR WAS HE
SOMEHOW -- I DON'T KNOW -- GIVEN
LIQUOR AND GIVEN THIS
INFORMATION SO HE WOULD SPILL
WHAT HE KNEW IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY
THIS?
TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE
ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE FBI?
THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF THINGS
WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.
SO MANY QUESTIONS ON BOTH SIDES.
HOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS
ABLE TO INVESTIGATE PEOPLE, AND
WHAT MEANS THEY ARE WILLING TO
USE AND ARE CAPABLE OF USING TO
EXTRACT INFORMATION WITHOUT
SOMEONE'S KNOWLEDGE.
THAT LEADS TO GROSS ABUSES OF
POWER, REGARDLESS OF WHO IS IN
POWER.
>> Harris: ADRIENNE?
>> Adrienne: I THINK GEORGE
PAPADOPOULOS IS TRYING TO GET A
BOOK DEAL RIGHT NOW.
HE MIGHT BE TRYING TO GET A
TELEVISION DEAL.
>> Harris: OH, BOY.
>> Adrienne: I THINK HE ENJOYS
THE LIMELIGHT.
HE'S BEEN USING HIS TWITTER FEED
RECENTLY TO PEDDLE SOME
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.
FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND TODAY HE
WILL BE TRYING TO SAY THIS IS
LIKE A DEEP STATE CONSPIRACY
THEORY.
I DON'T KNOW...
IT TO ME HIGHLIGHTS THE
IMPORTANCE OF WHY WE HAVE THIS
INVESTIGATION.
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
HAPPENED.
>> Jason: YOU THINK THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION --
>> Melissa: USE PAID BY THE
RUSSIAN SOMEHOW, THOUGH?
>> Adrienne: I DON'T KNOW.
>> THEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
POLLUTION.
MANY OF PEOPLE BEING PAID BY
FOREIGN ENTITIES IN ORDER TO
AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THE
CAMPAIGN.
HAVE WE SEEN THAT YET?
>> Adrienne: NO.
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN --
>> IS NOT THE POINT OF THE
INVESTIGATION?
>> Adrienne: YOU GET PEOPLE
BIKE GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS WERE
MORE THAN HAPPY TO TESTIFY
BECAUSE THEY ENTER THE     TILLM
BECAUSE THEY ENTER THE     TILLK
BECAUSE THEY ENTER THE     TILLE
ENJOYED THE LIMELIGHT.
>> Jason: THAT'S UNFAIR.
HE WAS CALLED FOR THE CONGRESS
THE FIRST TIME, AND YOU SAY IT'S
BECAUSE HE LIKES THE LIMELIGHT?
IT >> Adrienne: LOOK AT HIS
TWITTER FEED.
HE HAS CONSPIRACY THEORIES.
>> Jason: YOU HAVE TOO MUCH
TIME ON YOUR HANDS IF YOU'RE
WATCHING HIS TWITTER FEED.
>> Adrienne: I'M READING ABOUT
IT.
>> Jason: I THINK IT'S UNFAIR
SOMEBODY TO TRY AND CAST
DISPERSION UPON THE PRAYED I
DON'T THINK HE ASKED FOR THIS.
I DON'T THINK HIS LIFE IS BETTER
BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN THROWN INTO
THIS PREDICAMENT THAT HE HAS.
I DO THINK HE HAS SOMETHING HE
WANTS TO SHARE.
THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE OUT
THERE, THE HIGHEST ECHELONS OF
THE FBI WERE ACTING
INAPPROPRIATELY.
THAT'S WHY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL
DOESN'T WRITE WHAT HE HAS
WRITTEN.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE FISA VISAS AND THE
OTHER ALLEGATIONS OUT THERE,
THAT NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN.
>> Harris: ONE THING WE DO
WANT TO SAY, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE
WONDERING, PAPADOPOULOS HAS LIED
TO FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS.
