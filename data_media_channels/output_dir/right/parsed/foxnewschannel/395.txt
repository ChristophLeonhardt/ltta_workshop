AINSLEY: AS WE ARE SPEAKING
SENATORS ARE NOW IN WASHINGTON
REVIEWING THE LATEST FBI REPORT.
ALLEGEDLY NO EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL
MISCONDUCT AGAINST JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
BRIAN: WE HAVE A NEW TWEET FROM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
HE SAID THIS, THE HARSH AND
UNFAIR TREATMENT OF JUDGE
KAVANAUGH IS HAVING INCREDIBLE
UPWARD IMPACT ON VOTERS.
THE PEOPLE GET IT FAR BETTER
THAN THE POLITICIANS.
MOST IMPORTANTLY THIS GREAT LIFE
CANNOT BE RUINED BY MEAN AND
DESPICABLE DEMOCRATS AND TOTALLY
UNCORROBORATED ALLEGATIONS.
THE QUESTION IS, DID THE
PRESIDENT WRITE THAT AFTER
READING FBI REPORT?
DID HE PLAY HIS HAND, SAY THERE
IS NOTHING TO CORROBORATE THE
ACCOUNT.
AINSLEY: BRINGS UP GOOD POINT,
RUINING A GUY'S LIFE IF THERE IS
NO CORROBORATION, NO EVIDENCE,
HOW FAR DO YOU TAKE THIS?
A MAN WORKED HIS WHOLE LIFE WITH
A STELLAR REPUTATION AND HAS
CHILDREN AND A WIFE?
STEVE: SURE.
BRING IN DANA LOESCH, SYNDICATED
RADIO TALK SHOW HOST.
DANA EARNS THE SENATE LAST WEEK
ASKED THE FBI TO LOOK INTO THE
ALLEGATIONS BY DR. FORD.
THEY HAVE.
APPARENTLY PERSONALLY
INTERVIEWED NINE DIFFERENT
PEOPLE.
GOT A SWORN STATEMENT FROM A
10th.
WE DON'T KNOW IDENTITIES OF THE
HANDFUL OF PEOPLE.
THAT IS WHAT THE SENATE ASKED
FOR.
APPARENTLY THEY CAN PROVE HER
ALLEGATIONS.
NOW WHAT HAPPENS?
>> OF COURSE THEY CAN'T.
GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL, THESE
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN UNSUBSTANTIATED
ACCUSATIONS.
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS INNOCENT AND
SHOULD BE CONFIRMED TO THE
SUPREME COURT, IF, IF, HEAVEN
FOR BID THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN I
LIKE SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM'S
PROPOSAL TO RENOMINATE HIM AND
THEN APPEAL THE SENATE'S VERDICT
TO THE BALLOT BOX.
LET THE AMERICAN VOTERS DECIDE
HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE SENATE'S
TREATMENT OF BRETT KAVANAUGH,
PARTICULARLY STATES PRESIDENT
TRUMP HAS DONE VERY WELL,
INDIANA, NORTH DAKOTA, MISSOURI.
YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER THIS
MORNING ABOUT THE KAVANAUGH
EFFECT ON SOME OF THESE VERY
CLOSE RACES.
I LIVE IN TEXAS NOW BUT MY HOME
STATE MISSOURI SENATOR CLAIRE
McCASKILL IS IN MORE TROUBLE
THAN SHE EVER HAS BEEN AND A NEW
POLL SAYING KAVANAUGH HAVING
DIRECT EFFECT ON HER NUMBERS.
THIS IS HAVING EFFECT ON
REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM.
I HOPE REPUBLICANS DO NOT
GAMBLE.
I APPEAL AS A VOTER TO THE
SENATE AND PARTICULARLY TO LISA
MURKOWSKI AND SUSAN COLLINS AND
JEFF FLAKE, DO NOT LEGITIMATIZE
A HATEFUL PROCESS FALLING ONE
VOTE SHORT AND RUIN THIS MAN'S
LIFE AND GOODWILL WITH THE
AMERICAN VOTERS.
DO NOT GAMBLE THIS.
CONFIRM THIS INNOCENT MAN.
BRIAN: EIGHT DEMOCRATS ON THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SENT A
LETTER TO REPUBLICAN MEMBERS
YESTERDAY SUGGESTING THAT PAST
FBI INVESTIGATIONS INTO
KAVANAUGH MAY HAVE INCLUDED
INFORMATION ABOUT ALLEGATIONS OF
INAPPROPRIATE SEX ALL BEHAVIOR
OR ALCOHOL ABUSE.
WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
>> YEAH.
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IF THAT WAS
THE HIGH SCHOOL ANTICS OR THE
COLLEGE ANTICS, BUT DOESN'T
SUBSTANTIATE CLAIMS THAT HAVE
BEEN MADE.
DEMOCRATS NEED TO STOP MOVING
THESE GOALPOSTS.
EITHER HE IS A GANG RAPE
CAMPAIGN AND HE SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED ANOTHER WOMAN OR HE
DIDN'T.
YOU CAN'T COME UP WITH, AGAIN
MOVING THE GOALPOSTS, WELL, WE
DIDN'T LIKE HIS YEARBOOK QUOTE
OR MAYBE HE LIKED BEER WHEN HE
WAS IN COLLEGE.
WHAT COLLEGE FRAT BOY DIDN'T BY
THE WAY?
I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT IS GREAT
BUT I'M SAYING, FOR CRYING OUT
LOUD, IF WE'RE GOING TO SIT HERE
AND JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH BY
THESE STANDARDS, I'M TELLING
Y'ALL, A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
WASHINGTON, D.C., I HAVE SEEN
BOOZING AT SOME COCKTAIL PARTIES
WHO WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO
EVEN CAST A VOTE IN THIS
PROCESS.
AINSLEY: MAYBE THEY DIDN'T DO A
DEEP DIVE INTO THE HIGH SCHOOL
DRINKING BECAUSE MANY OF THEM
MIGHT NOT WANT A DEEP DIVE INTO
THEIR OPEN LIVES.
>> EXACTLY.
AINSLEY: WE'LL HAVE SENATOR
COONS, CHRIS COONS, DONE A TOUR
WITH JEFF FLAKE.
HE HAS BEEN ON SOME OTHER
MORNING SHOWS THIS MORNING HE
SAYS THIS INVESTIGATION DIDN'T
GO FAR ENOUGH.
KEEP IN MIND THIS IS THE SEVENTH
FBI INVESTIGATION.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE DEMOCRATS
ARE GOING TO SAY TO TRY TO STOP
THIS NEXT?
BECAUSE EVERYONE IS EXPECTING
THEY WILL.
>> YEAH.
WHATEVER DELAY TACTIC THEY CAN.
AT FIRST, REMEMBER WHEN WE ALL
GOT STARTED WITH THIS, WE HAVE
TO ALLOW THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE.
THE FBI NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE
THIS.
THEY NEED TO DO ANOTHER
BACKGROUND CHECK, A SEVENTH ONE
BECAUSE APPARENTLY THE SEVENTH
ONE WILL FIND WHAT THE PREVIOUS
SIX DID NOT.
IT WASN'T TO THEIR LIKING AND
CONCLUSIONS DON'T FIT THEIR
NARRATIVE AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY
WANT TO DELAY, NOW THEY'RE GOING
TO SAY THAT THE FBI DIDN'T DO
GOOD ENOUGH JOB AND NARRATIVE
CHANGES.
THEY NEED TO PICK ONE, STAY WITH
IT CONSISTENTLY, BECAUSE VOTERS
HAVE HAD ENOUGH.
FBI DID WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO.
THE SEVENTH BACKGROUND CHECK
DIDN'T UNCOVER ANYTHING TO
SUBSTANTIATE THEIR ALLEGATIONS.
THIS SALEM WITCH-HUNT NEEDS TO
BE STOPPED AND HE NEEDS TO BE
CONFIRMED.
BRIAN: WE'LL FIND OUT.
WE KNOW DEMOCRATS HAVE A PRESSER
AT 11:00.
AT WHICH TIME THEY ALREADY
CONDITION CONCLUDED THEY DON'T
LIKE THE RESULTS.
STEVE: SHOCKING.
>> I HOPE THEY DEFEND THE
PROCESS.
