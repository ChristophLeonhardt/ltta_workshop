cleanup operations underway in Germany
after the country and other parts of
Europe received a battering from storm
Frederick violent crosswinds meant the
skills of pilots were tested to the max
a video has emerged online of what can
only be described as something of an
extreme landing in Dusseldorf as we show
you this pictures here the plane is well
taking a pounding from the wind lurching
from side to side looking like at one
point it might even turn over the pilot
battles against the elements every step
of the way there before finally touching
down that is one excellent landing a
safe flight although perhaps not all
that enjoyable for those on board
