1
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,140
This was a wonderful place
for a lot of people to come to.

2
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,410
It was straight and gay and
it was a great place for

3
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,790
people to come and dance and
have fun and be safe.

4
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,350
Who would have thought?

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,860
One man's hate is
tripley undone by

6
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,610
a million people from around
the world's message of love.

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,710
We all deserve to be loved
and to show love.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,820
It's my community.

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,100
I watched some of the people in this
town, who maybe hated,

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,819
maybe tolerated, come around.

11
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:06,870
And I think they learned from
this that we're all human.

12
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:24,548
We will never forget our loved ones.
We will never forgive what happened

13
00:01:24,548 --> 00:00:00,000
here that night, but we
will try to heal.
