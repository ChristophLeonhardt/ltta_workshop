STEVE: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
THAT.
YOU'RE DOING GREAT WORK.WITH
ME NOW, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST,
ANN COULTER, POST OF KENNEDY ON
THE FOX BUSINESS NETWORK.
FROM UTAH CONGRESSMAN, AND
AUTHOR OF BOOK, THE DEEP STATE,
-- JASON CHAFFETZ.
BY THE WAY, WHY DID WE MENTION
THE BOOK, WE NEED TO DO THAT?
>> I WAS WONDERING THAT.
WE WILL GET TO IT LATER.
FROM NEW YORK FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR, TAMMY BRUCE.
TAMMY, I WILL BRING YOU AT
FIRST BECAUSE YOU ALL THE WAY
OVER THERE, I JUST WANT TO
START ANY DISCUSSION ON
IMMIGRATION.
WITH A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT.
FOR ME PERSONALLY WHICH IS THAT
BASICALLY, I AM
PRO-IMMIGRATION.
MY FAMILY FLED COMMUNISM IN
HUNGARY.
SOME OF THEM LITERALLY CLIMBING
OVER FENCES AS WE HAVE SEEN AS
REFUGEES FROM THE COMMUNIST
INVASION.
NOW I AM AN IMMIGRANT HERE
TWICE OVER.
SO IT HAS TO BE CONTROLLED IF
THERE WILL BE IMMIGRATION IT'S
QUITE CLEAR THAT IMMIGRATION
HAS BEEN OUT OF CONTROL AND
THESE SCENES WE ARE WITNESSING,
IT JUST TOTALLY EMPHASIZE THE
POINT OF CONTROL.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE
CAN LOOK AT THOSE PICTURES AND
NOT BE INCREDIBLY ALARMED OF
WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> LOOK, THE LACK OF REAL
POLICY HERE IN THE UNITED
STATES, THE LACK OF CONTROL,
THE EFFECTIVE THROUGH THE OBAMA
MINISTRATION, THE EFFECT OF
OPEN BORDER HAS ENCOURAGED THIS
NOW FOR HALF A GENERATION.
AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE
PICTURES, THE CHILDREN, PEOPLE
HUDDLING, THE DANGERS INVOLVED.
EFFECTIVELY, IT IS AN ABUSE OF
PROCESS THAT EXISTS.
BECAUSE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT
THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME
POLITICAL GAIN TO BE HAD BY
HAVING THE IMAGES, THAT THEY
CAN BE USED POLITICALLY.
JUST LIKE WITH THE KAVANAUGH
SITUATION.
OTHER PEOPLES LIVES DON'T
MATTER TO THE ESTABLISHMENT.
YOU SEE THE FRAMEWORK.
WE OF COURSE HAVE ABANDONED
POLICIES FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTH
AMERICA.
TO DEAL WITH CORRUPT REGIMES
WHERE THERE IS HORRIBLE
DYNAMICS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE
FLEEING.
BUT THE SOLUTION THAT DONALD
TRUMP IS COME UP WITH IS A GOOD
ONE.
IF YOU HAVE A SAFE NATION THAT
WILL ACCEPT REFUGEE STATUS FOR
YOU, THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
GET IT AT THE UNITED STATES
BORDER.
AND THAT IS IMPORTANT.
IF THIS IS REALLY ABOUT REFUGEE
FRAMEWORK, THE INTERNATIONAL
SCENE RECOGNIZES THIS AS THE
VERY NEXT SAFE COUNTRY AND FOR
THESE INDIVIDUALS, IT IS
MEXICO, IT IS NOT THE UNITED
STATES.
AT LEAST THERE IS FRAMEWORK OF
A STRUCTURE THE PRESIDENT IS
MOVING IN.
HE WAS RIGHT IN HIS TWEET THAT
THEY COULD SOLVE SOME OF THIS
IN AN HOUR IF THE DEMOCRATS
WERE NOT OBSTRUCTING.
BUT LIKE WITH DACA, THEY REALLY
DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.
THEY WANT TO SHOW THIS, THEY
WANT TO TRY AND BLAME IT ON
TRUMP AND IS NOT GOING TO WORK
THIS TIME.
STEVE: LET'S PICK UP JASON ON
THAT MEXICO POINT.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS,
ASSUMING THE CHANGED ATTITUDE
OF MEXICO.
THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD THIS
NEW TRADE DEAL NEGOTIATED.
THE ACTIONS THEY ARE TAKING DO
SEEM TO BE MORE COOPERATIVE.
>> WE ARE ABOUT TO FIND OUT.
MAYBE OR MAYBE NOT.
UNITED STATES AMERICA LEGALLY
AND LAWFULLY BRINGS IN ABOUT A
MILLION PEOPLE YEAR.
MORE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY
COMBINED.
IN THIS SURGE IS ONE OF THE
WORST THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN
DEMOCRATS AND COURAGE.
IT STARTED WITH BARACK OBAMA.
WHEN HE CHANGE THE PARAMETERS
OF ASYLUM.
HE BASICALLY SAID COME HERE AND
WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY YOU CAN
COMMIT THIS CLAIM.
THEY YOU SEE THESE PEOPLE, AND
THEY ARE RAPED, THEY ARE
PILLAGED, THEIR TAKEN ADVANTAGE
OF.
IT IS HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND AT
THE DEMOCRATS, THEY SEEM TO
THINK IT'S OKAY!
THEY SHOULD BE SAYING NO.
IF YOU WANT TO CLAIM ASYLUM AND
THE RIGHT WAY WITH THE UNITED
STATES, GO TO THE LOCAL
EMBASSY.
IN HONDURAS OR GUATEMALA AND AS
A COUNTRY, WE SUPPORTED THEM
FOR DECADES.
GO TO THE NEXT COUNTRY AND STAY
THERE.
DO NOT LEAPFROG TO TRY AND GET
TO THE UNITED STATES.
>> THE DEMOCRATS HATE IT WHEN
YOU SAY YOU ARE FOR OPEN
BORDERS.
THEY SAY NO BUT THIS IS AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO SHOW
THAT.
IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND
I WILL SEE A SINGLE DEMOCRAT
SPEAKING UP AGAINST THIS.
AND ERIC GARCETTI -- THERE'S AN
ARGUMENT HE PUT OUT THERE THAT
I THINK IS, IT REVEALS
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE
DEMOCRATS SEE.
LET'S WATCH.
>> FUNDAMENTALLY, WHAT THE
ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T GET LIKE
SO MANY OF ITS PLANS, THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY ARE AGAINST, THEY
DON'T HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
INVESTING FOR INSTANCE AND
STABILIZING THE ECONOMIES OF
THE COUNTRIES IN CENTRAL
AMERICA.
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO CUT OFF --
THEY THINK A WALL WILL KEEP
PEOPLE OUT WHEN THEY DON'T GO
TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM.
STEVE: THAT IS EXACTLY WRONG.
I WANT TO POINT IT OUT.
EXPLAIN TO THE AUDIENCE, OF
COURSE IT IS TRUE THAT THE ROOT
PROBLEM IS THE FACT THAT YOU
HAVE THESE FAILED STATES.
FEELING EVEN MORE.
BUT THE IDEA THAT INVESTING
WHICH IS CODE FOR GIVING THEM
MORE MONEY WILL SOLVE THE
PROBLEM IS SO RIDICULOUS.
IT IS ABOUT ENCOURAGING THEM TO
GET RICHER IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY
PRETTY MEANS THE INSTITUTIONS,
THE MARKET ECONOMY IN A FREE
SOCIETY, PROPERTY RIGHTS, RULE
OF LAW, ALL OF THE THINGS THAT
ARE THE BASIS TO GET RICHER AND
BE STABLE.
NOT JUST HANDING THEM OVER
MONEY.THEN HE SAYS IS NOT
ABOUT THE WAR.
WHICH BRINGS ME TO YOU, IT JUST
CAPTURES THIS ATTITUDE THAT YOU
HAVE TOOTH, -- TO A POINT OF
SAYING WE ARE AGAINST THE WALL.
>> THIS AND RIPTA KEEP
ADMITTING EVERYONE THAT RUNS
ACROSS THE BORDER, I'VE HEARD A
LOT OF DEMOCRATS SAY THAT.
FIRST WE HAVE TO SOLVE ALL OF
THESE OTHER COUNTRIES PROBLEMS.
NO, THAT IS PRECISELY WHY WE
DON'T WANT THEM COMING HERE.
AND I MEAN, TO YOUR RELATIVES
ESCAPING HUNGARY, WE DON'T HAVE
A HOLOCAUST, WITH A HARVEST OF
YOUR UNIT, THERE'S NOT A POTATO
FAMINE.
IN EACH ONE OF THOSE CASES
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME
UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE.
IT WASN'T LIKE HOW THE IRISH
ALWAYS LIVED, ALWAYS STARTING
TO GET.
NO, THERE WAS A POTATO FAMINE
BECAUSE A POTATO CROP DIED.
YOU ARE SUBJECT TO COMMUNISM.
ADOLF HITLER ROSA.
THIS IS HOW THESE PEOPLE OF ALL
THE TIME.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO CORRECT
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF CULTURE.
I MEAN YES, WE WISH THEM LUCK,
WE WANT TO HELP THEM.
BUT TO SAY WE HAVE TO CHANGE
CULTURES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND
FOR A THOUSAND YEARS AND HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN HEAVILY CORRUPT,
HEAVILY POOR.
IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.
YOU MAY AS WELL SAY FIRST YOU
HAVE TO COLONIZE MARS.
THEN WE CAN BUILD THE WALL.
STEVE: I WOULD SAY CULTURALLY
THIS IS THE INSTITUTIONAL
THING.
THEY DON'T HAVE THE
INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK.TO
SUPPORT --
>> YES BUT IT'S BEEN A THOUSAND
YEARS, AMERICA IS NOT GOING TO
SOLVE -- 
>> I AGREE WITH THAT AND I
THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
FOR THIS DIRECT INVESTMENT
WHICH IS FUTILE.
AND IT REALLY PULLS PEOPLE OUT
OF POVERTY.
IN A COUNTRY LIKE THAT THERE IS
MORE EXTREME POVERTY CERTAINLY
THEN IN MEXICO AND UNITED
STATES.
IT IS FREE-TRADE.
ACTUALLY OPENING UP MARKETS.
AND NOT INVESTING IN, BUT
CAPITALIZING ON THE NATURAL
RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE AND IN
ADDITION TO THE LABOR THAT THEY
HAVE GOT.
PART OF THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE
HERE IS, AND THIS GOES BACK TO
SOME OF THE FORMER COLLEAGUES,
WE HAVE SO MANY DISCREPANCIES
IN IMMIGRATION AND IT IS SO
CONFUSING AND LEGAL IMMIGRATION
IS REALLY LAUGHABLE AND
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.
THAT HAS CREATED AN IMPACT THAT
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS LOVE.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK
TOGETHER ON IMMIGRATION.THEY
LOVE THESE PICTURES BECAUSE
THEY RILE UP THE COMPLETELY
TORN APART BASIS ON EACH SIDE.
AND IF YOU HAVE LESS CHAOS AND
IF YOU HAVE MORE RULE OF LAW
AND PEOPLE KNEW EXACTLY HOW
THEY COULD GET INTO THE COUNTRY
AND HAVE MORE INCENTIVE TO GO
BACK WHEN THEY WERE DONE
WORKING, IT WOULD BE MUCH
BETTER FOR BUSINESSES AND
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO
ARE BEING TORN APART AND THAT
MEANS THAT I.C.E. AGES CAN'T GO
AFTER BAD PEOPLE GETTING THE
COUNTRY BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY
THEY ARE HAVING TO LOOK AFTER
THESE OVERRUN DETENTION
CENTERS.
>> I THINK THAT'S WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE BEGINNING.
