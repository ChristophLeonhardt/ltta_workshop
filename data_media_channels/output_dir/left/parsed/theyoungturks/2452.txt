NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE
MAINSTREAM MEDIA TELL ME TO
CELEBRATE BIPARTISANSHIP AND
THAT IT'S A
WONDERFUL THING.
I THINK IT DEPENDS.
IF THEY COME UP WITH A GOOD
COMPROMISE, I UNDERSTAND AND
APPRECIATE THE NEED FOR
COMPROMISE.
WE ARE PRACTICAL BUT OFTENTIMES
THEY COME UP WITH
DISASTROUS COMPROMISES AND THAT
IS THE CASE IN THE IMMIGRATION
BILL
SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THEY
CAME UP WITH JUST LAST NIGHT.
TALKING POINTS MEMO REPORTING:
THAT 
IS A TERRIBLE COMPROMISE.
ON THE ONE HAND, OKAY, YOU
PROTECT DREAMERS, BUT THEY
HAVE AN ENORMOUS PATHWAY TO
CITIZENSHIP.
12 YEARS.
REMEMBER, INDENTURED
SERVITUDE WAS SEVEN YEARS.
IN RETURN FOR THAT DONALD TRUMP
ASKED FOR A PREPOSTEROUS
$25 BILLION AND THE DEMOCRATS
GAVE IT TO HIM AND THEN YOU
CAN'T PROTECT THE DREAMERS
PARENTS.
YOU CAN'T SPONSOR FAMILY
MEMBERS FROM COMING IN, IN THE
PARTICULAR PROVISION I JUST READ
TO YOU.
ALL OF THESE HORRIBLE PROVISIONS
ARE IN THERE.
BEGINNING TO CUT DOWN ON NOT E
LEGAL IMMIGRATION BUT LEGAL
IMMIGRATION AND THE DEMOCRATS
SAID YES.
NO HERE COMES THE TWIST.
AFTER THEY AGREE TO THIS
TERRIBLE COMPROMISE TRUMP COMES
IN AND GOES, HA HA, NOT GOING
TO GIVE IT TO YOU ANYWAY.
SO HE SENDS THE DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY TO GO CRAP ALL
OVER THE COMPROMISE LEGISLATION.
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY SAYS:
THAT IS VERY STRONG LANGUAGE.
OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUS BUT THEY
DO NOT WANT THIS TO PASS.
DONALD TRUMP HAS TOLD THEM HE
DOESN'T WANT TO COMPROMISE.
HE WANTS EVERYTHING.
HE DOESN'T WANT A COMPROMISE
THAT IS MASSIVELY IN FAVOR
OF THE REPUBLICANS, HE WAS
EVERYTHING BECAUSE HE THINKS
THESE DEMOCRATS ARE SO WEAK AND
PATHETIC I WILL JUST BREAK THEM
AND THEY WILL GIVE ME EVERYTHING
AND GET NOTHING IN RETURN.
IT IS ACTUALLY A FEASIBLE
OUTCOME KNOWING THE DEMOCRATS.
THEY CONTINUE:
AGAIN, OUTRAGEOUS OVER-THE-TOP
TALK.
PREPOSTEROUS.
NONE OF THE PROVISIONS HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HOW THE
9/11 TERRORIST GOT TO THE
COUNTRY.
THEY GOT IN ON BUSINESS AND
TOURISM AND STUDENT VISAS.
THIS DOESN'T ADDRESS ANY OF
THAT.
IT HAS TO DO WITH THE WALL
AND NONE OF THE 9/11 TERRORISTS
WERE DREAMERS, THEY JUST MADE
THAT UP.
THERE IS NOTHING THEY WILL NOT
STOOP TO, TO TRY TO GET
THEIR WAY.
IT WAS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT EVEN
LINDSEY GRAHAM, I THOUGHT
HE WAS BUDDIES WITH DONALD
TRUMP?
IT TURNS OUT, HE WAS
DISAPPOINTED.
IN FACT
HE SAYS HE IS INCREDIBLY
DISAPPOINTMENT IN THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY
FOR RELEASING SUCH A
POLITICIZED STATEMENT.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT FROM THE
TRUMP WHITE HOUSE?
THESE POLITICIANS DRIVE ME NUTS.
OH GOLLY GEE, THE TRUMP WHITE
HOUSE IS BEING POLITICAL.
I'VE GOT THE VAPORS.
AND THEN GRAHAM CONTINUES TO
SAY:
YOU DON'T SAY, LINDSAY.
OF COURSE, THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
ALL THE TIME.
TRUMP IS SAYING YOU GAVE ME
ALMOST EVERYTHING I WANTED,
IDIOTS.
I'M GOING TO ASK FOR MORE
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ENABLED HIM
AND THEY HAVE EMPOWERED HIM TO
DENIGRATE ALL PROGRESSIVES
PRIORITIES AND TO DEMAND
EVERYTHING IN RETURN SO
HEY, DEMOCRATS, HOW IS THAT
NEGOTIATION STRATEGY
WORKING OUT FOR YOU?
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD YOU GUYS PLAY
THREE-DIMENSIONAL CHESS AND
YOU ARE ALL PRACTICAL AND
GENIUSES AND IF YOU JUST GIVE IN
TO TRUMP OVER AND OVER AGAIN
THAT YOU WILL GET YOUR WAY.
DOES IT LOOK LIKE WE ARE GETTING
OUR WAY?
NO, YOU'VE TRADED AWAY
EVERYTHING.
THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
THERE ACTUALLY IS ONE COMPROMISE
BILL THAT IS NOT SO BAD.
LOOK, IT IS NOWHERE NEAR PERFECT
AND IT HAS A WHOLE HOST OF
PROBLEMS.
I WOULDN'T READ ANYWHERE LIKE
THIS, BUT I AM TELLING YOU,
PROGRESSIVES ARE NOT
IMPRACTICAL.
BUT CORPORATE DEMOCRATS,
ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS
GIVE AWAY EVERYTHING AND SAY,
THAT IS A PRACTICAL THING TO DO.
NO, IT IS NOT.
THE FIGHT FOR OUR PRIORITIES AS
WELL IS PRACTICAL.
THERE IS, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
ACTUALLY A BIPARTISAN BILL
THAT IS NOT, AGAIN, IT IS NOT
GREAT BUT IS WAY BETTER
THAN THE OTHER ONE.
SO A FRIENDLY PIECE OF ADVICE TO
DEMOCRATS.
VOTE FOR THAT ONE, NOT THE
TERRIBLE COMPROMISE TRUMP
IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ANYWAY.
SO INSIST ON THE ONE THAT IS
BETTER AND THEN IF YOU DO
NOT GET YOUR VOTE, THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU DO?
YOU DO A POLITICAL FIGHT.
YOU TAKE IT TO THE PEOPLE AND
YOU SAY, IF THESE BUMS,
YOU KNOW OVER 80%
OF AMERICANS WANT THE DREAMERS
TO HAVE A PATHWAY TO
CITIZENSHIP?
IF YOU CANNOT WIN ON THAT ISSUE
THEN RETIRE.
IF YOU SAY I AM SUCH AN
INCOMPETENT POLITICIAN THAT I
NEED MORE THAN 80% OF THE PEOPLE
ON MY SIDE, PLEASE RETIRE.
PLEASE STEP ASIDE.
LET REAL PROGRESSIVES RUN.
PEOPLE WHO KNOW POLITICS, WHO
ARE PRACTICAL AND KNOW HOW
TO WIN.
SO AGAIN, STICK WITH THE COONS-
MCCAIN BILL AND IF TRUMP AND THE
OTHER REPUBLICANS WON'T VOTE FOR
IT THEN KICK THEIR ASS WITH IT
AND
THEN GET ENOUGH DEMOCRATS AND
THAT WILL VOTE FOR THAT BILL.
I KNOW, VERY COMPLICATED AND
HARD FOR SIMPLEMINDED
ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRATS TO
UNDERSTAND.
OR YOU COULD DO WHAT YOU ARE
LIKELY TO DO, GIVE DONALD
TRUMP EVEN MORE.
THEY ARE UNBEARABLE.
