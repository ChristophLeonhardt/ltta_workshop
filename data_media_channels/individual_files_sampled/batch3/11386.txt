scandal over Donald Trump's alleged use of a racial slur has seen a hail of accusations of racism slung at the US president one former aide claims she has a recording of the US president saying a racial slur though this recording has yet to emerge that has not stopped the media rounding on Trump for alleged racism at the end of the day we don't need a tape to know that Donald Trump is racist I was at the unite the right rally in Washington DC on Sunday I didn't hear anybody say the n-word but I'm pretty sure those guys were still racist we were curious about what she could possibly say that might dispel some of the animosity the black community has toward her after all of these years of her being complicit in trumps clearly racist you know policies and actions however amid the scandal a new poll shows that support for the u.s. president among the black community has almost doubled since last year ass americana investigates according to this poll Trump has more support among African Americans than Republican candidates of the past but African Americans are still the most politically homogeneous voting bloc consistently voting for Democrats rapper Kanye West who's recently made headlines over his support for Trump says that going against this trend makes you a pariah in the community everyone around me tried to pick my candidate for me mm-hmm and then told me every time I said I liked Trump that I couldn't say it out loud or my career would be over I get kicked out to black community because blacks are we suppose have a monolithic thought we can only like we can only be Democrats at all though it's unclear whether such statements from black celebrities have a positive effect on Donald Trump's popularity a leading civil rights group says Trump trotting out his black surrogates to woo voters has little impact as the majority of African Americans truck Trump strategy of trotting out black people to support him is not working if it is intended to inspire african-american support for him or his policies a majority of black voters say these celebrities have no impact before Trump's set off on the campaign trail in 2015 black rappers and hip-hop artists felt a little differently about him in the 90s they often mentioned Trump in their music boasting of his wealth so why're african-americans starting to think this way we asked around to find out do you think African Americans support Trump would you want to guess a percentage I'm definitely going to say that not a lot of them support them Wow 30 are you kidding me 36 36 not even close to what I thought about 6% it's actually 36% really are you surprised by that at all mm-hmm why is that because I don't know any black Trump supporters why do you think some African Americans support Trump by some I mean one-third I'm gonna say probably because they thought that he was the best chance for our economy instead of thinking about where we are socially there is a chance to be heard which hasn't been there before I think those that do probably are looking from from an economic perspective he's a businessman right so more Americans including black Americans are finding job opportunities and by that I mean it's not just you must take the one job you find you're seeing that there are multiple opportunities people are now I'm getting to buy a car for themselves or a truck for themselves for the first time in sin in a long time last summer we set a record among Americans including black Americans who went on education for the first time and it looks like we're gonna see another record-breaking activity with that in that regard a lot of black Americans are experiencing this and it's no surprise that they understand it's the policies of President Donald Trump that they that they accept that they acknowledge and that they're very appreciative of you
