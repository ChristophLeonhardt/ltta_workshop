00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,980
in the middle of desperation another
potential crisis may be brewing this is

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,139
not a small place the whole island and
the problem with the diesel and the

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,710
gasoline we are trying to work with
these people

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,750
we are trying to still providing
services to these people dr. Maria

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,769
Rodriguez has worked at this Community
Health Clinic for 24 years it's one of

6
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,340
70 such places all across the island
which serves the frontline for

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,340
preventive health care
everything from broken bones to

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,100
counseling to pharmacy services for many
Puerto Ricans but as fuel dwindle so

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,370
will care in that way that if we
continue to provide these services in

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,250
this area we stop the that the patients
go to the hospital that is already

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,750
overcrowded they have been told that
they have just six hours of fuel left

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,820
and at that point without any help they
will have to close their doors what else

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,430
we can do the only thing we can do is go
into the shelter we do the medical

14
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,070
evaluation but we can provide
medications to those patients and that's

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,330
in part why you're seeing tents like
this pop up in places like San Juan

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,220
you see even before Maria a third of the
population here was reported to be in

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,119
poor health the more likely to be older
here more likely to have chronic disease

18
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,009
like hypertension and diabetes and
therein lies the concern what happens to

19
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,610
all these patients if they don't get
access to care within the next several

20
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,439
days getting health care services up and
running is key but the only way to do

21
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,640
that is to make sure clinics like this
are powered with fuel and right now

22
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,950
that's a big unknown Domingo Cruz
director of San Jorge pediatric hospital

23
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:51,479
knows just how critical it can be just
two days ago it was dark and all of a

24
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:59,759
sudden as you may understand everybody
was very nervous if we were we started

25
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,840
evaluating transfers possible transfer
to other hospitals patients that could

26
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,260
have been discharged home
earlier than what it was initially it

27
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,780
perceived they were running low on fuel
just two days worth and a dozen children

28
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,330
on ventilators who are ready to evacuate
the entire hospital if we didn't get

29
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,490
power somehow early afternoon a
neighboring hospital brought 1200

30
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:34,050
gallons of fuel and then yesterday a
u.s. army tank provided three more days

31
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:40,440
worth to keep this generator going it
was a close call a day we thank God that

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:47,160
it work out it's been trying
professionally as well as personally in

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,360
the midst of the storm his mother passed
away

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:59,940
bury her the day of the stroke the day
after is done I sure need to be open got

35
00:02:59,940 --> 00:00:00,000
people looking for us
