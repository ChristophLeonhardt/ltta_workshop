00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:14,934
LELAND: SOME OF THE MOST POPULAR

2
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:15,735
DEMOCRATS IN THIS YEAR'S

3
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:16,435
PRIMARIES ARE AMONG THE MOST

4
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:20,406
PROGRESSIVE AND RECENT HISTORY.

5
00:00:20,406 --> 00:00:21,674
THEY WORRY THE SAME POSITIONS

6
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:24,277
THAT MAKE THEM POPULAR NOW WILL

7
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:25,211
TURN TOXIC COME NOVEMBER.

8
00:00:25,211 --> 00:00:28,114
WHEN WE WERE IN OHIO YESTERDAY,

9
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:28,748
FORMER BOMB ADMINISTRATION

10
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:30,816
OFFICIAL NOW RUNNING FOR

11
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:31,584
GOVERNOR SAID THE DIVIDE BETWEEN

12
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:32,317
REAGAN DEMOCRAT AND PROGRESSIVE

13
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:37,089
LIBERAL IS JUST A MEDIA FIX IT.

14
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:38,591
>> I DON'T THINK IT REPRESENTS

15
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:40,026
ANY REAL SPLIT PARTY.

16
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:40,726
BERNIE SANDERS HAS NOT MADE AN

17
00:00:40,726 --> 00:00:42,795
ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE

18
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:43,462
ALTHOUGH SENATOR WARREN HAS

19
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:45,097
ENDORSED ME.

20
00:00:45,097 --> 00:00:49,201
>> HERE TO DISCUSS WAYS AT THE

21
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:54,407
BATTLE OF THE SEC GOING DOWN ON

22
00:00:54,407 --> 00:00:54,941
A SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

23
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:57,910
ROBERT, TO YOU FIRST.

24
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,812
IS HE RIGHT THERE'S NOT A SPLIT

25
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:01,280
IN THIS IS JUST FICTION?

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,049
>> THERE IS A SPLIT BETWEEN THE

27
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:03,783
MODERATES IN THE PARTY COME THE

28
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:04,450
PEOPLE AROUND PARTY INTO THE

29
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,920
GROUND OVER THE LAST DECADE AND

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,021
PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE PARTY

31
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:09,655
WHICH IS THE FUTURE OF THE

32
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,657
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

33
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:13,626
THINGS LIKE THE UNIVERSAL

34
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,428
GUARANTEED INCOME FROM

35
00:01:15,428 --> 00:01:17,263
IMMIGRATION REFORM, ADDRESSING

36
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:18,798
POLICE BRUTALITY, WORKING

37
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:21,734
TOWARDS ISSUES THAT AFFECT YOUNG

38
00:01:21,734 --> 00:01:22,501
PEOPLE, STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS

39
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,870
WILL DRIVE THE PARTY TO THE

40
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,204
FUTURE.

41
00:01:25,204 --> 00:01:26,238
PEOPLE WHO RAN THE PARTY INTO

42
00:01:26,238 --> 00:01:27,773
THE GROUND ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE

43
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:28,407
PAID ATTENTION ON THE NEW

44
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:33,145
PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE PARTY.

45
00:01:33,145 --> 00:01:34,113
LELAND: ASSUMING THAT EXIST AS

46
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:34,814
ROBERT SAYS, WILL TAKE HIM AT

47
00:01:34,814 --> 00:01:36,716
FACE VALUE.

48
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:39,819
HOW DO REPUBLICANS EXPLOIT THAT?

49
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:41,587
>> IT'S REALLY A TOUGH BATTLE

50
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:43,656
RIGHT NOW AS YOU SAY IN THE

51
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:44,824
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS MOVING MY

52
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:45,124
LEFT.

53
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:47,760
REPUBLICAN PARTY MOVIE MARBURY.

54
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,295
A WIDE OPENING IN THE MIDDLE.

55
00:01:49,295 --> 00:01:49,996
WAS ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

56
00:01:49,996 --> 00:01:52,231
THAT I'M NOT SURE.

57
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:53,799
BUT JUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO

58
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:54,567
CONTINUES TO GO RIGHT IN MORE

59
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:57,336
RIGHT AND IT'S GOING TO GO THAT

60
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:58,304
WAY THROUGH 2020.

61
00:01:58,304 --> 00:01:58,738
AS 20.

62
00:01:58,738 --> 00:01:59,071
HIS 20.

63
00:01:59,071 --> 00:01:59,805
HIS FIRST 2018 GOES, NOT A LOT

64
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:02,541
OF EXPLOITING THE DEMOCRATS TO

65
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:06,879
THE RIGHT TO SUPPORT TRUMP AND

66
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,346
HIS PEOPLE.

67
00:02:07,346 --> 00:02:11,083
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPECIAL

68
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,919
ELECTION, IT WAS A DEMOCRAT

69
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,653
ESSENTIALLY RUNNING ALMOST AS A

70
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:17,723
MODERATE REPUBLICAN IF YOU

71
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:20,092
LISTEN TO AND WITH NANCY PELOSI

72
00:02:20,092 --> 00:02:20,693
AND OTHERS THAT WON THE

73
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:21,060
ELECTION.

74
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,398
YOU MAY SAY PROGRESSIVES ARE THE

75
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:26,098
FUTURE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

76
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:31,003
BUT IS THAT A WINNING FUTURE?

77
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:31,771
>> IMAGIST INEPTITUDE BY THE

78
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:37,009
CLINTON CAMPAIGN THAT RESULTED

79
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:37,810
IN CAMPAIGN IN STATES WHERE THEY

80
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,347
NEEDED A MORE PROGRESSIVE

81
00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:41,680
METHOD.

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,648
DISTRICT BY DISTRICT, WHAT WE

83
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:45,251
SEE IS PEOPLE ARE RUNNING ON A

84
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:45,951
BET THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A

85
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:47,520
DAILY IF NOT WEEKLY SCANDAL

86
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,388
GOING ON IN PUSHING OUT THEIR

87
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:49,688
BASE.

88
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:54,026
THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO PLAY BY

89
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:54,827
THE POLICY CLINTON STENY HOYER

90
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:55,961
PLAYBOOK IS A THING OF THE PAST.

91
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:01,400
THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY IS RIGHT

92
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,734
NOW.

93
00:03:01,734 --> 00:03:02,802
>> AS WE LOOK FORWARD IN THE WAY

94
00:03:02,802 --> 00:03:05,404
THIS IS SHAPING UP, AND IT IS

95
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:06,672
CLEAR HOW THE PRESIDENT IN THE

96
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:08,240
WHITE HOUSE WANT TO FRAME THE

97
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,443
SERVICES ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

98
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:11,310
YOU SAW THAT YESTERDAY WITH THE

99
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,011
PRESIDENT WAS IN OHIO FOR A

100
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,814
SMALL BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE.

101
00:03:14,814 --> 00:03:17,516
HERE'S ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE

102
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:17,983
ROUNDTABLE.

103
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:22,188
>> WE CHOSE TO MOVE FORWARD.

104
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:23,355
WE HAD CONTEMPLATED THAT FOR

105
00:03:23,355 --> 00:03:24,056
SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS, DIDN'T

106
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:27,226
FEEL IT WAS THE RIGHT TIME THAT

107
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,260
WE SAW WITH YOUR STRONG

108
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,095
LEADERSHIP THAT NOW IS THE TIME

109
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:33,199
TO REINVEST IN OUR COMPANY.

110
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,601
>> OS DO THE SAME QUESTION I

111
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:38,504
ASKED IN THE POSTER UP A BIT

112
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:38,838
EARLIER.

113
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:39,638
THOSE FOLKS ON STAGE CERTAINLY

114
00:03:39,638 --> 00:03:42,975
SEEM TO CREDIT THE PRESIDENT.

115
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:44,543
AS WE WENT THROUGH OHIO, PEOPLE

116
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:47,713
SAID THE ECONOMY IS DOING

117
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:48,047
BETTER.

118
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:49,949
THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY GIVE THE

119
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:50,549
CREDIT TO THE PRESIDENT.

120
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:51,851
HOW DO REPUBLICANS WIN THE

121
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:58,724
ARGUMENT IN 28 TEAM?

122
00:03:58,724 --> 00:03:59,425
>> THE BIGGEST FOR REPUBLICANS

123
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:00,159
IN 2018 AS THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT

124
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,826
WHAT TRUMP HAD DONE AND WHAT

125
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:04,430
TRUMP CAN DO IT WITH HIM IN THE

126
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,831
WHITE HOUSE, HOW IS THE ECONOMY

127
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,165
TURNED?

128
00:04:06,165 --> 00:04:08,534
EVEN IF IT'S NOT HIM

129
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:09,735
SPECIFICALLY, HE'S BEEN IN THE

130
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:10,136
WHITE HOUSE.

131
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:12,638
JOB NUMBERS ARE AT.

132
00:04:12,638 --> 00:04:15,474
MORE MONEY IN PEOPLE'S PAYCHECKS

133
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:16,308
GOING UP.

134
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:17,543
FOR THOSE THAT MAY NOT TALK

135
00:04:17,543 --> 00:04:18,344
ABOUT, THEY LOOK UP MONEY IN

136
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:18,810
THEIR PAYCHECKS.

137
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,680
FOR THOSE THAT LIKE PRESIDENT

138
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,048
TRUMP, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT

139
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:24,250
HAVE TO SUPPORT BECAUSE THE

140
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,118
VOTER NUMBERS ARE NOT AS HIGH IN

141
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:26,785
A MIDTERM ELECTION LIKE THEY

142
00:04:26,785 --> 00:04:28,921
WILL BE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL AND

143
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:30,022
THEY ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THOSE

144
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:32,424
THAT SAY WE ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP

145
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,125
SUPPORTERS BECAUSE THEY THINK

146
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,894
THEY HAVE TO DEFEND HIM FROM THE

147
00:04:34,894 --> 00:04:40,799
MEDIA, THE LEFT SIDE.

148
00:04:40,799 --> 00:04:43,502
>> CERTAINLY AS YOU LOOK AT THE

149
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:44,236
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY DEAL, A RACE

150
00:04:44,236 --> 00:04:46,338
OF WHO CAN BE MORE TRUMP, WHO

151
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:48,340
CAN WRAP THEMSELVES AS A

152
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,577
REPUBLICAN MORE IN THE FLAG OF

153
00:04:51,577 --> 00:04:51,877
CHARM.

154
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:55,181
ROBERT QUESTION TO YOU.

155
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:56,182
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.

156
00:04:56,182 --> 00:04:57,049
EVERYONE WE TALKED TO IN OHIO

157
00:04:57,049 --> 00:05:00,486
SAYS THE ECONOMY IS DOING GREAT.

158
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:02,254
HOW DO DEMOCRATS DO ANYTHING

159
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:03,589
OTHER THAN SAY THANK YOU,

160
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:04,557
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

161
00:05:04,557 --> 00:05:05,291
HOW DO YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THE

162
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,727
ECONOMY WHEN THINGS ARE DOING

163
00:05:08,727 --> 00:05:09,094
WELL?

164
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:09,762
>> THESE NUMBERS WOULD FORCE

165
00:05:09,762 --> 00:05:11,330
EVERYONE TO RUN FOR THE MIDDLE.

166
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,433
THE PROBLEM IS THE PRESIDENT HAD

167
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,234
SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS ON A DAILY

168
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:18,070
AND WEEKLY BALLOTS.

169
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,737
DEMOCRATS RUN ON RESTORING

170
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,940
FAMILY VALUES TO THE WHITE

171
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,240
HOUSE.

172
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,241
THEY RUN ON THE FUTURE OF THE

173
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:22,942
COUNTRY NOT BE IN A SITUATION

174
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:27,780
WHERE TALK ABOUT STARS IN

175
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,347
EVERYDAY RESTORING THE

176
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:31,684
PRESIDENCY PEOPLE CAN BE PROUD

177
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:32,017
OF.

178
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:32,751
LELAND: GENTLEMEN, APPRECIATE

179
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:33,018
IT.

180
00:05:33,018 --> 00:00:00,000
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
