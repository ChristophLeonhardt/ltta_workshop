1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
now this was not a normal week so this
is not a normal show president Trump's

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,429
actions and inactions in the wake of
Charlottesville are provoking some

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,309
uncomfortable conversations mostly off
the air for being honest in discussions

4
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,600
among friends and family and debates on
social media people are questioning the

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,199
president's fitness but these
conversations are happening in newsrooms

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,150
and TV studios as well usually after the
microphones are off or after the stories

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,859
are filed after the papers been put to
bed people's concerns and fears and

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:39,120
questions come out questions that often
feel out of bounds off-limits too hot

9
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:46,820
for TV questions like these is the
President of the United States a racist

10
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:58,170
is he suffering from some kind of
illness is he fit for office and if he's

11
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:05,729
unfit then what these are upsetting
polarizing questions that they're

12
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,780
uncomfortable to ask but we in the
national news media can't pretend like

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,030
our readers and viewers aren't already
asking they are asking this is how deep

14
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,860
the country's divide that's really
become my impression is that since

15
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:24,240
president Trump's inauguration there's
been a lot of a lot of tiptoeing going

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
on his actions have been described as
unpresidential as unhinged and sometimes

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,060
even crazy
now that word crazy can be interpreted

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,960
several different ways it gets said a
lot more in private than it gets set on

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,070
TV for instance this next soundbite was
never meant to be heard on TV at all

20
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,640
last month Republican senator Susan
Collins was overheard on a hot mic

21
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,409
saying that trumps handling of spending
was incredibly irresponsible Democratic

22
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:59,130
senator Jack Reed responded by saying he
thinks Trump is crazy I don't say that

23
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,700
you know lightly and it's a kind of
59 this week republican senator bob

24
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:14,040
Corker questioned the president
stability watch president has not yet is

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,640
not yet been able to demonstrate the
stability nor some of the confidence

26
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,700
that he needs to demonstrate in order to
be successful

27
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,810
now some democrats not surprisingly have
gone a lot further california Democrat

28
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,580
Zoe Lofgren asked if Trump has early
stage dementia she says she wants a

29
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,010
medical mental exam conducted another
California dem jackie speier called for

30
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,040
Trump's removal under the 25th amendment
and Al Gore said Trump should resign

31
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,160
we're also hearing this in some liberal
corners of the news media and the

32
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,980
entertainment world
you saw late night comics got very

33
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,060
furious this week Jimmy Kimmel made
jokes about making Trump a powerless

34
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,820
King but he meant what he said about
getting Trump out of office desperate

35
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,790
times call for desperate measures
and I'm asking you the people who

36
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,810
supported Donald Trump to step in and
help for the good of this country Mike

37
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,120
Pence is ready he's boring he's
relatively sane he looks like a neighbor

38
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,830
you might borrow a lawn mower from let's
get him in there before it's too late

39
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,130
let's make America Great Britain again
now if you've picked up their Sunday

40
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,420
paper you've seen that the papers are
filled with cries for change this is the

41
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,470
Los Angeles Times the liberal editorial
board they're saying enough is enough

42
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,360
Trump is quote a danger to the
Constitution a threat to our democratic

43
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,730
institutions now all this brings me back
to those questions that are tough to ask

44
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:50,430
out loud on national television is the
President of the United States suffering

45
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:57,950
from some sort of illness is he racist
is he fit to be commander in chief and

46
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,160
one more is it time for objective
journalists and I don't mean opinion

47
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,480
folks I mean down the middle journalists
to address these questions head-on and

48
00:04:06,480 --> 00:00:00,000
if so how in the world should they do
that
