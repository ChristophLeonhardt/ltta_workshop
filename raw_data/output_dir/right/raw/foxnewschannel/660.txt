1
00:00:08,964 --> 00:00:09,697
HEATHER: REFUSING TO BACK DOWN

2
00:00:09,698 --> 00:00:10,431
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THAT HE

3
00:00:10,432 --> 00:00:11,799
BELIEVES THAT KIM JONG UN WILL

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,334
HONOR DENUCLEARIZATION AGREEMENT

5
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,536
BUT SUGGESTED THAT CHINA COULD

6
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,605
BE OBSTRUCTING THE GOAL AMID

7
00:00:17,606 --> 00:00:19,206
TRADE TENSIONS, SO THE PRESIDENT

8
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:21,375
TRUMP FIGHTING THIS BATTLE ON

9
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:22,476
TWO FRONTS?

10
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:24,145
JOINING ME NOW MILITARY EXPERT

11
00:00:24,146 --> 00:00:26,780
LIEUTENANT COLONEL DANIEL DAVIS,

12
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,215
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US

13
00:00:28,216 --> 00:00:29,817
THIS MORNING.

14
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:30,317
APPRECIATE IT.

15
00:00:30,318 --> 00:00:33,954
>> YOU BET, MY PLEASURE TO BE

16
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:35,623
HERE, THANKS.

17
00:00:35,624 --> 00:00:36,924
HEATHER: DO YOU BELIEVE CHINA IS

18
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:38,826
MED UNTIL THIS DENUCLEARIZATION

19
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:39,960
PROCESS WITH NORTH KOREA, DO YOU

20
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:40,694
BELIEVE WHAT THE PRESIDENT

21
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:41,929
TWEETED OUT?

22
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,763
>> THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS WE

23
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:43,998
HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

24
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,366
TO UNDERSTAND WITH CHINA, THAT

25
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:49,904
ANYTHING.

26
00:00:49,905 --> 00:00:50,905
AND THE SECOND THING IS THAT

27
00:00:50,906 --> 00:00:53,340
THEY THINK IN TERMS OF REGIONAL

28
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:55,209
STRATEGIC VIEW, THEY VIEW MANY

29
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,911
THINGS ALTOGETHER AND THAT

30
00:00:56,912 --> 00:00:58,746
INCLUDES THE TRADE WAR RIGHT OFF

31
00:00:58,747 --> 00:01:00,681
THE TOP BUT ALSO THE

32
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:01,382
DENUCLEARIZATION ISSUE WITH

33
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,750
NORTH KOREA, THE SOUTH CHINA SEA

34
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:03,884
WITH ALL OF THE ISLANDS THAT

35
00:01:03,885 --> 00:01:05,553
THEY ARE BUILDING OUT THERE AND

36
00:01:05,554 --> 00:01:07,588
ALSO THE TAIWAN ISSUE, THEY

37
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:08,822
THINK OF ALL THOSE THINGS

38
00:01:08,823 --> 00:01:10,624
TOGETHER AND WE DON'T HAVE TO

39
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,394
WONDER THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE

40
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,828
DOING.

41
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,330
CHINA-STATE MEDIA THAT THOSE ARE

42
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,165
CONNECTED, THEY WILL USE

43
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,400
WHATEVER LEVERAGE THEY CAN IN

44
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:20,701
COMBINATION WITH ALL OF THAT TO

45
00:01:20,702 --> 00:01:22,269
GET WHAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST

46
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,308
INTEREST OF CHINESE ECONOMIC

47
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:29,510
ON THE DENUCLEARIZATION ISSUE,

48
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:30,311
THEY MAY BE WILLING TO DO THAT

49
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:31,612
AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

50
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:33,547
IMPORTANT THAT WE ALSO THINK IN

51
00:01:33,548 --> 00:01:34,915
THOSE SAME TERMS OF HAVING ALL

52
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:36,383
THOSE THINGS TOGETHER AND IT'S

53
00:01:36,384 --> 00:01:41,722
NOT INDIVIDUAL LIKE STOVE-POT

54
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:43,524
KIND OF OPTIONS.

55
00:01:43,525 --> 00:01:45,492
HEATHER: SO WHAT SHOULD THE

56
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:47,294
TERMS BE BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES

57
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:48,896
TO TARIFFS, WE KNOW THE U.S. AND

58
00:01:48,897 --> 00:01:50,531
CHINA THEY ARE PLACING 25%

59
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:53,867
TARIFFS ON $34 BILLION OF EACH

60
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:01,875
INCREASED TO 32.2 BILLION, WHAT

61
00:02:01,876 --> 00:02:03,377
TYPE OF LEVERAGE DO WE HAVE,

62
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:05,112
WHAT TYPE OF LEVERAGE DO THEY

63
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:05,613
HAVE?

64
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:06,647
>> RIGHT, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT

65
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:08,782
-- PLUS, CHINA HAS BEEN CHEATING

66
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:10,283
ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

67
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:11,852
FOR A LONG TIME AND PRESIDENT

68
00:02:14,356 --> 00:02:16,390
BRING IT BACK INTO BANS BUT THE

69
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,861
WANT TO PREZ TOO HARD IN

70
00:02:20,862 --> 00:02:22,463
ECONOMIC REALM WITH THE TRADE

71
00:02:22,464 --> 00:02:23,964
WAR THAT COMPLICATES OUR

72
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:30,571
COOPERATIVE OR THEY CAN BE MORE

73
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:31,205
COMBATIVE DEPENDING ON HOW

74
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:31,972
THINGS GO IN THAT DIRECTION.

75
00:02:31,973 --> 00:02:33,574
I THINK MAYBE THERE ARE BETTER

76
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:34,708
WAYS, CERTAINLY OTHER WAYS TO

77
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:36,143
HANDLE THE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS

78
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:37,978
THROUGH THE WTO AND OTHER

79
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:38,312
THINGS.

80
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,580
WE HAVE GOOD TRACK RECORD WITH

81
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:45,352
ALL OF THAT BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO

82
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:47,421
GOING TO BE WITH NORTH KOREA.

83
00:02:47,422 --> 00:02:49,323
HEATHER: CAN I ASK YOU WHAT DID

84
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:50,924
YOU TAKE THIS MEANS TO MEAN WHEN

85
00:02:50,925 --> 00:02:52,393
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

86
00:02:52,394 --> 00:02:53,661
CAME OUT OF MEETINGS WITH NORTH

87
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:58,499
GANGSTER-LIKE, THE DEMANDS --

88
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,134
OUR DEMANDS ARE GANGSTER-LIKE

89
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,108
GANGSTER-LIKE THEN THE WORLD IS

90
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:09,677
GANGSTER-LIKE BECAUSE IF YOU ARE

91
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:12,179
TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS IT WAS A

92
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,447
UNANIMOUS DECISION TO KEEP

93
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:14,715
SANCTIONS UNTIL DENUCLEARIZATION

94
00:03:14,716 --> 00:03:16,317
IS COMPLETE.

95
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,652
>> HOW THE TWO SIDES VIEW THINGS

96
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:19,153
DIFFERENTLY.

97
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:20,321
IN THE NORTH KOREA SIDE, I WILL

98
00:03:20,322 --> 00:03:22,656
POINT OUT THAT ON THE CHINESE

99
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:23,524
SIDE, UNITED STATES, SOUTH

100
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:24,792
KOREA, EVERYONE SAYS THAT

101
00:03:24,793 --> 00:03:26,660
DENUCLEARIZATION IS THE ULTIMATE

102
00:03:26,661 --> 00:03:28,362
GOAL AND THEY ALL BELIEVE THAT.

103
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:29,863
THE PATH TO GET THAT, THOUGH,

104
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:30,764
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

105
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:33,767
NORTH KOREA WHEN THEY SAID GANG

106
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:36,170
STF LIKE WHAT THEY VIEW IN

107
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:37,805
CONTEXT, HEY, YOU'RE COMING AND

108
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:39,440
AND YOU'RE GOING ROB US BY

109
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:41,141
ASKING US TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING

110
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:43,143
AND THEN AT THE END THEN WE HAVE

111
00:03:50,385 --> 00:04:01,462
THE THINGS.

112
00:04:01,463 --> 00:04:02,262
IF WE GO IN THE SITUATION WHERE

113
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:02,996
WE HAVE TO HAVE 100% BEFORE WE

114
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:03,764
GIVE ANYTHING, IT WOULD BE HARD

115
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:04,998
TO COME TO ANY KIND OF

116
00:04:04,999 --> 00:04:06,567
CONCLUSION, WE HAVE TO MAYBE

117
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,707
HEATHER: KIM JONG UN HAS TO

118
00:04:13,708 --> 00:00:00,000
APPEAR TO BE FIGHTING BACK, WE
