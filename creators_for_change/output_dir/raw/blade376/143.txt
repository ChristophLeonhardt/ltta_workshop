1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">I propose that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we set up an online</font>

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,350
database system which will address

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,879
problems occurring in the world today

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,250
and provide solutions that are backed by

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,969
research and not just opinion

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,049
consequently this will create a strong

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:15,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">foundation for us to then develop tools</font>

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,770
to spread awareness all over the world

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,960
inspiring people to educate themselves

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,769
and to become problem solvers before

11
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,150
explaining the education<font color="#E5E5E5"> and awareness</font>

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,949
project it would be I deals first

13
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,080
explore the underlying principles of

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">education and awareness I mean when I</font>

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,180
mention the word education<font color="#E5E5E5"> what comes to</font>

16
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,579
mind do you feel the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way education</font>

17
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,010
operates in society today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good enough</font>

18
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,149
and if not why not personally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

19
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,070
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> education should be primarily</font>

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,200
about the transfer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> information from</font>

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">one person to the next but instead it</font>

22
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the process in which we</font>

23
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:52,649
inspire other people to question<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

24
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,770
think for themselves furthermore the

25
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,660
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> people receive shouldn't be</font>

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,030
based upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> their geographical location</font>

27
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,190
or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money they have it</font>

28
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,199
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how much they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

29
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,560
educated<font color="#E5E5E5"> now when it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spreading</font>

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,119
awareness of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> project the goal</font>

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,070
should be focused upon making people

32
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,830
want to actively participate in this it

33
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,689
should literally just be about making

34
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">people aware it may sound like an</font>

35
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">obvious point but it is one that is</font>

36
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,350
disregarded by so many activist groups

37
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,090
and movements today who aim to

38
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,600
indoctrinate others with their values to

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,890
give an example of spreading awareness

40
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,170
recently I have been informing my

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,759
friends about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things going on in the</font>

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,500
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment not many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people know</font>

43
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,110
about they agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that solutions</font>

44
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,970
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented but they do not</font>

45
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,790
feel motivated to acts now they have

46
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,500
gone back to living their lives not

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">letting this new information affect the</font>

48
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,210
way they live their life however this is

49
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because there may become a point</font>

50
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,229
where their personal life becomes

51
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,390
affected by local national or global

52
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,060
problems this could include<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font>

53
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,810
unemployed or building up a huge debt

54
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,280
such occurrences would be the very

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,229
catalyst which makes them decide to

56
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:06,030
become active<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the educational</font>

57
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,068
awareness project this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be their</font>

00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">own awakening so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reality that this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">world needs to come together</font>

60
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,450
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately the main points I'd</font>

61
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,920
like to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> about educational awareness</font>

62
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,170
is that it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

63
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,720
ability to choose because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

64
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,280
choose to become involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,020
project and not because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've been</font>

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,090
told to join they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be much more</font>

67
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,300
passionate and engaged many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people will</font>

68
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">argue that awareness it's about taking</font>

69
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,080
to the streets and making a physical

70
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">presence to promote the change they wish</font>

71
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see in this world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly a</font>

72
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,190
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the awareness process but having</font>

73
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,230
a strong foundation which contains

74
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,720
detailed information with<font color="#E5E5E5"> credibility</font>

75
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,450
will give much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus and power to</font>

76
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">those wishing to take such actions</font>

77
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:54,150
because if or when the system fails the

78
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,830
frustration among society will be

79
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,110
reduced if we have a transparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

80
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,030
of information which provides viable

81
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,510
solutions to the occurring problems

82
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,170
frustration comes from the lack of

83
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,290
solution now and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> live their lives</font>

84
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,720
while politicians take care of society

85
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,450
put out inverted commas and this is

86
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly why the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> average person doesn't</font>

87
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,930
have solutions for many of the world's

88
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,060
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> today because in their current</font>

89
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,630
system it was never their responsibility

90
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,520
but regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your job title whether</font>

91
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,460
you're a politician or a shopkeeper we

92
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,470
are all humans and we should all have

93
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,540
the opportunity to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

94
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,970
for the better we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see currently that</font>

95
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,740
political systems all over the world are

96
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">being held under immense scrutiny by the</font>

97
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,940
general populations for example when

98
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,530
civil unrest is occurring in the Middle

99
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,780
East many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not look towards our</font>

100
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,580
prime ministers and presidents to find

101
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,620
out what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on we can see with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">own eyes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through the internet therefore</font>

103
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,870
we turn to our leaders and say this is

104
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,980
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you doing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

105
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,000
furthermore having an educated

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,830
population will actually reduce

107
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,680
significantly the risk of governmental

108
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,130
corruption and exploitation and going

109
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,750
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of frustration</font>

110
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,430
frustration is going to occur when

111
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">things within the society starts a fire</font>

112
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,709
and people begin to wonder things like

113
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,290
how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> these elected politicians allow</font>

114
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,358
this to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is when</font>

115
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,959
anger will really hit hard the recession

116
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">was described by many politicians as</font>

117
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,280
being unforeseeable when this was simply

118
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the</font>

119
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,120
case the only reasons it<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have been</font>

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,200
unexpected as they would describe it

121
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,360
would be due to poor communication of

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,400
information since there were politicians

123
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,220
who did warn us back then or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> facts</font>

124
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,650
opinions and hidden agendas got in the

125
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,660
way after all my driving instructor

126
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,790
warned me about a recession coming years

127
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,010
before it actually did because he had

128
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,140
access to research and information which

129
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:52,770
revealed this a recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> event I'd like to</font>

130
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">highlight that illustrates the nature of</font>

131
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,340
frustration is the loss of confidence in

132
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,560
the government in Egypt people took to

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> streets were very passionate but</font>

134
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,250
peaceful protests because they had a

135
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,170
solution in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> they knew what they</font>

136
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,630
wanted and therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustration was at</font>

137
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,210
a controllable level but when President

138
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:11,160
Mubarak said he wasn't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to step</font>

139
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,460
down which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what the people wanted</font>

140
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,660
frustration rose and violent clashes

141
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,850
began<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people no longer knew what</font>

142
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,650
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could do but when the president</font>

143
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally did step down the country</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> united</font>

144
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,850
and things went to a new degree<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

145
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,280
normality I mean next<font color="#E5E5E5"> day people</font>

146
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,320
clearing up the streets and getting back

147
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,080
on with their lives education is about

148
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,270
empowering people with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

149
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,130
become problem solvers based on

150
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">legitimate research and not opinion</font>

151
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,180
whilst awareness is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving people</font>

152
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the opportunity to come together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

153
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,100
work towards common goals so the

154
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,230
education<font color="#E5E5E5"> and awareness project I'd like</font>

155
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to propose consists of three stages the</font>

156
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,960
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to create an information</font>

157
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,070
database and secondly<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enable audience</font>

158
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,670
