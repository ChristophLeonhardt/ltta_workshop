1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,870
You’re looking at one of the most incredible
moments in human history.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,050
That’s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, walking
on the moon.

3
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,249
Okay, maybe you’ve seen this clip before,
but think about that for a second: They’re

4
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:13,429
on the moon.

5
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:17,750
A celestial object nearly 240,000 miles into
outer space.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,460
That distance is like flying all the way around
the Earth 9 1/2 times.

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:28,749
Millions of people around the world watched
on July 16, 1969, as Apollo 11, carrying astronauts

8
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:34,010
Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins
launched from Cape Kennedy, Florida,

9
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,360
and disappeared into the sky.

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,080
It was the climax of years of preparation
and research, and the pinnacle moment of the

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,610
so-called “Space Race” between the United
States and Soviet Union, a years-long rivalry

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,960
to compete for dominance in space exploration.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,230
For the eight days following the launch, the
world awaited the return of the would-be heroes.

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,300
So what actually happened between here

15
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,330
and here?

16
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:06,080
So let’s start with the components of the
ship that were discarded one by one until

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
this

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,320
became this.

19
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,500
Here’s the rocket that sent the astronauts
into space: the Saturn V.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,500
The three stages of the Saturn V each played
a different role in launching Apollo on a

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,920
path to the moon — we’ll get to that later.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,170
On top of the rocket is the actual Apollo
spacecraft.

23
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,140
It’s made up of three parts too.

24
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,390
There’s the lunar module, the component
that would eventually land on the lunar surface,

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,530
the service module, which had propulsion systems
for course corrections and entering and escaping

26
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,990
orbit, and the command module, where our three
heroes were for most of the mission.

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,190
And last but not least, this is the launch
escape system, which was designed to pull

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,820
the command module away from the rocket if
something went wrong during launch.

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,530
Together, all these pieces made up the Saturn
V rocket and Apollo 11 spacecraft.

30
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:59,150
But it’s the way they came apart that made
the moon landing happen.

31
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,710
The Saturn V’s first stage launched Apollo,
carrying the spacecraft 42 miles above the

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,659
Earth and reaching a speed of about 6,000
miles per hour.

33
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,090
The first stage then detached, and once the
Saturn V’s second stage kicked in, the now

34
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,930
needless launch escape system jettisoned too.

35
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,640
The second stage propelled the spacecraft
even farther and faster into space, and after

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,720
it detached, the third stage of the rocket
fired briefly to knock Apollo into a parking

37
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,560
orbit, 103 miles above the Earth’s surface.

38
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,040
Here, final checks were made, and the Saturn
V fired again to set Apollo on course to the

39
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,319
moon, in a move called the “translunar injection.”

40
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,180
Once the spacecraft propelled away from Earth,
the Saturn V’s job was done.

41
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,359
Now the astronauts needed to pull off a mid-flight
maneuver to reconfigure the ship so the crew

42
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:47,409
could access the lunar module, which had been
stored in a protective compartment during

43
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,409
launch.

44
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:52,579
To do this, the command and service modules
detached together and flipped 180 degrees,

45
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,909
docking with the lunar module and extracting
it.

46
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,530
In the process, they ditched the third, now-useless,
stage of the Saturn rocket.

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,189
This whole high-stakes launch process only
took about 3 1/2 hours and this — the completed

48
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,709
Apollo spacecraft — was the end result.

49
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:13,169
For the next three days, Apollo coasted through
space.

50
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,269
Until it finally reached its target and was
pulled into orbit by the moon’s gravity.

51
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:18,919
This is where the crew split up.

52
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,919
Armstrong and Aldrin transferred to the lunar
module, named Eagle, and slowly descended

53
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:24,040
toward the surface.

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,499
While Collins continued to circle the moon
in the command module, called Columbia.

55
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,680
Now here comes another tricky part: landing
on the moon.

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,129
To make this historic moment happen, Eagle
turned and used its engine to slow its momentum

57
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:38,859
and ultimately touch down on the lunar surface.

58
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,489
“The Eagle has landed.”

59
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:45,469
The moonwalk was broadcast live on television,
immortalizing Neil Armstrong’s words here:

60
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:53,230
“That’s one small step for man, one giant
leap for mankind.”

61
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,019
“I think that was Neil’s quote I didn’t
understand.”

62
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:01,089
“‘One small step for man,’ but I didn’t
get the second phrase …”

63
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:05,159
After about 21 1/2 hours on the moon, Eagle
performed the first launch from a celestial

64
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,709
body that wasn’t Earth, leaving its landing
gear behind and timing its ascent with Columbia’s

65
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:12,510
path in lunar orbit to rejoin the spacecraft.

66
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,209
Once Armstrong and Aldrin transferred back
into the command module, the lunar module

67
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,959
was no longer needed.

68
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,539
Just like before, Apollo needed to break out
of orbit.

69
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:27,620
This maneuver is called the transearth injection,
and began the 2 1/2 day journey home.

70
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,580
Upon approaching its entry point into Earth’s
atmosphere and no longer needing its propulsion

71
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,000
engines, Apollo jettisoned the service module
and prepared for reentry, protected by the

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,120
now-exposed heat shield on the bottom of the
command module.

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,129
“Apollo blazes across the heavens, coming
back to Earth at 25,000 miles per hour.”

74
00:04:45,129 --> 00:04:49,620
Parachutes deployed, and Columbia splashed
down safely into the Pacific Ocean.

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,400
And what was once a 3,000-ton behemoth of
rocket, fuel, and freight

76
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,800
was reduced to this.

77
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,259
A small command module floating in the ocean,
carrying three astronauts and rock samples

78
00:05:00,259 --> 00:00:00,000
collected from the surface of the moon.
