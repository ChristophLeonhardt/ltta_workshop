there was one example in The Washington Post mr. Diaz and I'm just curious if you've had to deal with something like this where it was a former soldier and they only he only wanted to give his first name because he was afraid he'd be targeted and he said that the State Department told him that they weren't convinced he was a US citizen that they needed a bunch of the following documents either his mother's evidence of his mother's prenatal care his baptismal certificate maybe rental agreements when he was a baby this is a grown man I'm sorry I don't think my mother has the power bill from when I was born in 1972 is this the burden of proof that's being put on on your clients yes and yes and that is what is going on with they're asking for things that no one has no one in the whole United States has pretty near record from her mother the person that is four years old there's no way they have them so they're asking for things that they know they don't have them people get frustrated but if you live in the border there is a need for you to cross to the other side you have family you have things to than the other side and when they're coming back that's when they are detaining them they're putting me preceding them or they're making them sign documents so they can get away from it I what it is happening so rages and they really you know opportunity like these to tell the American people what is going on is incredible because we're not talking about people that naturalize we're talking people who were born in the United States that you happened to be have a Hispanic last name and they were born with Midway's but that's still Americans mr. Diaz if you had any client who didn't have an s panic last name who had their passport taken away not that I can remember over right now on top of my head you know most of them have been taken away no I have people that I've represented that have having difficulty getting a pastor because they were born in southern Texas with a midwife but someone that has a passport taken away a revoked was never coming back or through a letter in the mail no I have never had hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meat to press content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mindset right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
