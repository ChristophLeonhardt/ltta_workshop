they hey why P because why people are
successful and they're not
well no the grimace in the mind is that
the the Animus the anger they hate Y P
because white people are successful and
they're not I mean yes it is it is a
welfare state we have we have spent
trillions of dollars on welfare but
we've put people in bondage so that they
can't be all that they're capable to
being so it's becoming a racial issue
there's nothing racial about what
happened it's tragic
what you know you look at the
educational system seventy percent of
all African American children are born
out of wedlock this is tragic and it's a
breakdown in our society
I apologize for the comments they
certainly weren't men in the context of
how many have viewed them frankly I was
quoting is what they were saying last
night that I observed on on your network
and their their hatred for for white
people
