let's take some plane and we put all of
them Cesario

take the first column and you say be
happy you should if a little considered
City Council a little ridiculous you
alcohol because it's go young
suppository investor
this is a commemoration area that is
formed with flowers and candles and
notes for the victims who passed and
there's a lot of heaviness in the air
here there's a lot of silence in shock
Marius sealed off the police have
forbidden anyone to pass into the actual
shooting area
Papa's an emoji problem isn't
when I got the
yes well just kind
moving up with the
Kiska Jamison fool survivors of a to
Allah respectively
I'm chunky
with a twitch love
just poki Bobo ha was sending loss
come on shondo
how do you guys feel coming there right
now January we thought that it is
something isolated time but then
and same year second time so like
what's nice - yeah they were just going
into a concert have fun
nobody would have gotten on that
interest Kevin Oh bollocks of getting
what crazier and crazier if yo speed all
needs blood we need to stand ready if
there is
any local initiatives that has been
asked to the civilian we need
we're ready I refuse to lose my freedom
from then we're gonna drink some wine
tonight in order to tomorrow we're going
to steal the life is going on and it's
still going on and say
not one anything
in Paris we we are not like at war but
we need to imagine that there is some
Australia to answer to harm anyone it's
not only in France yeah it's everywhere
Muslims aren't doing this to us
extremists are doing this from the very
differently
so we're on our way to a public now it's
a very symbolic center in the heart of
Paris where people come to the protest
and express feelings enough about the
Charlie Hebdo it was an epicenter of
like protest movements and we're going
to go and see who is there and you know
how people are feeling in the aftermath
of this attack
there is no more to negotiate you know
we try to negotiate I try to tarry day
right can you say which one of these
things but when you find t realized one
there is another one there is another
one coming to try to radicalize on the
top
yes yes yes oh it's really it's never
anything like this mhm no negotiation
episode I told you what is a solution 12
hours from Paris we have lot of stones
fixed all that like Island all these
people in the island let's take some
plane and we put all of them from Syria
just before the good and saga will take
the first column you see happy nation if
a little considered is in Mesa City
Council immediately the ridiculous you
on course because it's for young
position historiography it sooner
American to demo in some dodgy misses
your way to evaluate a chemical not
scrap available and yes you have to put
no intellectual fight before it's a
police fight for a military Pike and it
is far too simple to say we should check
them all in prison and it's not a
solution and it's also you would
radicalize other people I suppose I
think we are enough clever here fish and
France to know which is a good guy in
the bad guy that makes the good mask in
and they are the majority and the 100
maybe up 200 a trend right here we're
gonna and although the good ones they
pay for this this guy too
so how many times again all the good one
for the pay for the red one
Paris here we are the mistake of freedom
therefore in this conflict in general
were shocked that it happened earlier
near our apartment I mean people the
idea should could be our friends or
family I mean it happened and this at
the beginning of the year because we
shall you do now it's quite different
because it's I mean the terrorist attack
is for everybody now not the only the
Jews not only the press is for everybody
now so it's what we are saying that it's
like the difference the whole country is
now attack what happened today in France
is not only important for us it's
important for the world
a zone
the gravity show didn't even know
to complain
then one more you did over there
on
