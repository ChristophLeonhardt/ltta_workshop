1
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:10,162
>> Shepard: MORE ON WHAT IS NEXT

2
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,564
FOR THE NORTH KOREA SITUATION.

3
00:00:11,564 --> 00:00:14,734
GORDON CHANG IS HERE, AUTHOR OF

4
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:17,536
"NUCLEAR SHOW DOWN, NORTH KOREA

5
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:18,804
TAKES ON THE WORLD."

6
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:19,605
THEY HAD A GOOD WEEK.

7
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,173
>> NORTH KOREA HAD A GOOD WEEK.

8
00:00:21,173 --> 00:00:23,743
WE HAD THE SUMMIT.

9
00:00:23,743 --> 00:00:28,114
KIM JONG-UN GOT

10
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:28,614
LEGITIMATIZATION.

11
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:30,649
THAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR HIM.

12
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:32,885
HE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE

13
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:33,252
MILITARY.

14
00:00:33,252 --> 00:00:36,655
WE NOW THE TOP THREE OFFICERS

15
00:00:36,655 --> 00:00:37,857
BEING CHANGED AND HE'S HAD

16
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:39,558
PROBLEMS AT THE BOTTOM AS WELL.

17
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,361
HE CREATED EXPECTATIONS.

18
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:45,564
EVERYBODY WANTS A BETTER LIFE.

19
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:48,801
WE KNOW HE HAD AN EXCELLENT

20
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:49,735
WEEK.

21
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:51,437
NORTH KOREAN PROPAGANDA -- WE'LL

22
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:53,372
SEE THE PICTURES AS LONG AS KIM

23
00:00:53,372 --> 00:00:55,040
IS IN CHARGE.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,610
>> Shepard: IF YOU BACK IT UP

25
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,078
FARTHER, YOU'VE SAID THAT THIS

26
00:00:59,078 --> 00:00:59,912
PRESIDENT HANDLED THAT SITUATION

27
00:00:59,912 --> 00:01:00,679
VERY WELL.

28
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,448
WE WERE IN A BETTER POSITION.

29
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:03,082
>> YEAH.

30
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:05,084
TEN DAYS AGO, I THINK TRUMP

31
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,719
BEING TRUMP PUT US IN A GOOD

32
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,086
POSITION.

33
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,120
IT WAS THE NORTH KOREANS THAT

34
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:11,991
WERE MAKING CONCESSION.

35
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:14,794
>> Shepard: WHAT DID THEY

36
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:15,127
CONCEDE?

37
00:01:15,127 --> 00:01:19,298
>> THEY GAVE UP THE THREE

38
00:01:19,298 --> 00:01:19,698
AMERICANS.

39
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:20,933
THEY MADE PLEDGES.

40
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:23,035
THEY SAID THEY WOULD GIVE UP ALL

41
00:01:23,035 --> 00:01:25,538
OF THEIR ARSENAL IN EXCHANGE NOR

42
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:26,539
ENDING THE KOREAN WAR AND A

43
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,841
PLEDGE NOT TO ATTACK THEM.

44
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:30,943
THAT'S NOT TOO BAD A DEAL.

45
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:32,478
ESPECIALLY IF THEY GET

46
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:34,380
EVERYTHING THAT -- GIVE UP

47
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:34,780
EVERYTHING.

48
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,416
THE POINT IS AT THAT SUMMIT WE

49
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:38,317
GOT A ENJOYMENT STATEMENT BUT

50
00:01:38,317 --> 00:01:39,418
THE ENJOYMENT STATEMENT WAS

51
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:39,718
VAGUE.

52
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:42,455
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE END OF THE

53
00:01:42,455 --> 00:01:42,755
DEAL.

54
00:01:42,755 --> 00:01:44,690
IT'S LIKE A TERM SHEET AS

55
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,524
NEGOTIATORS WOULD SAY.

56
00:01:45,524 --> 00:01:47,526
THE POINT IS WE SHOULD HAVE

57
00:01:47,526 --> 00:01:48,561
GOTTEN SOMETHING MORE.

58
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:50,062
>> Shepard: WE GAVE UP THE

59
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:50,696
HANDSHAKE, RIGHT?

60
00:01:50,696 --> 00:01:53,899
>> WE GAVE UP THE HANDSHAKE.

61
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:55,034
ONE OTHER THING.

62
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:55,868
>> Shepard: SECURITY.

63
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:56,936
A SECURITY PROMISE.

64
00:01:56,936 --> 00:01:58,337
>> AND THE JOINT STATEMENT,

65
00:01:58,337 --> 00:01:58,637
YEAH.

66
00:01:58,637 --> 00:02:00,906
WE SAID WE WOULD GIVE A SECURITY

67
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:05,344
PROMISE.

68
00:02:05,344 --> 00:02:06,078
THEY SAID THEY THEY WOULD GO FOR

69
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:06,812
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

70
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:07,179
PENINSULA.

71
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:07,980
THEY SAID THEY WOULD RETURN

72
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,314
REMAINS.

73
00:02:08,314 --> 00:02:08,948
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

74
00:02:08,948 --> 00:02:10,049
IT WAS GOOD FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

75
00:02:10,049 --> 00:02:11,884
TO PUT THAT ON THE AGENDA.

76
00:02:11,884 --> 00:02:12,785
IT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE

77
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:13,719
WERE TALKING ABOUT.

78
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,955
THE PRESIDENT GETS CREDIT FOR

79
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:16,255
THAT.

80
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:17,490
THE POINT IS THEN THE PRESIDENT

81
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,558
TURNS AROUND TO THE PRESS

82
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:20,259
CONFERENCE AFTER HIS MEETING

83
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:21,694
WITH KIM AND HE SAYS, LOOK,

84
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:26,665
WE'RE GOING TO STOP THE MILITARY

85
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:27,032
EXERCISE.

86
00:02:27,032 --> 00:02:29,635
>> Shepard: HE CALLED THEM WAR

87
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,237
FOR 30 YEARS.

88
00:02:31,237 --> 00:02:32,738
>> WAR GAMES IS A TERM FROM KIM

89
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:33,072
JONG-UN.

90
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,074
HE DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM THE

91
00:02:35,074 --> 00:02:35,608
PENTAGON.

92
00:02:35,608 --> 00:02:38,744
HE SAID THE "WAR GAMES" WERE

93
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:39,144
PROVOCATIVE.

94
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:40,513
THAT'S NORTH KOREAN AND CHINESE

95
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:41,146
TALKING POINTS.

96
00:02:41,146 --> 00:02:42,348
THEY'RE NOT PROVOCATIVE.

97
00:02:42,348 --> 00:02:43,315
THEY'RE DEFENSIVE.

98
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:44,750
THE POINT HERE IS THAT WE'RE NOT

99
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,785
ONLY DEFENDING SOUTH KOREA,

100
00:02:46,785 --> 00:02:47,987
WE'RE DEFENDING THE UNITED

101
00:02:47,987 --> 00:02:48,320
STATES.

102
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,255
>> Shepard: DID HE SAY THAT

103
00:02:49,255 --> 00:02:50,756
BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT'S WHAT THE

104
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:51,590
NORTH KOREANS WANTED TO HEAR?

105
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,192
HE JUST HEARD IT FROM THEM.

106
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,194
THEY ALWAYS CALLED THEM

107
00:02:55,194 --> 00:02:55,594
PROVOCATIVE.

108
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:56,795
WHY WOULDN'T THEY CALL THEM

109
00:02:56,795 --> 00:02:57,830
PROVOCATIVE TO HIM?

110
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,033
IF HE AGREES WITH THAT, MAYBE HE

111
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:01,867
WILL GET SOMETHING ELSE.

112
00:03:01,867 --> 00:03:04,336
I WAS WONDERING IF THAT WAS THE

113
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:05,170
THINKING BUT --

114
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,805
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

115
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,407
>> Shepard: WHY WOULD HE SAY

116
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:10,309
TODAY THE NORTH KOREA THREAT IS

117
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:10,609
OVER?

118
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:12,578
I MEAN, SAYING SOMETHING LIKE

119
00:03:12,578 --> 00:03:15,314
THAT IS A -- JUST MAKE YOU

120
00:03:15,314 --> 00:03:17,650
WONDER ABOUT EVERYTHING.

121
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,186
>> NORTH KOREA ON MONDAY HAD

122
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:26,792
ENOUGH FISSILE MATERIAL FOR 20

123
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:28,561
TO 60 WAR HEADS.

124
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:29,795
>> Shepard: WHO IS IN CHARGE OF

125
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:30,729
THAT STUFF?

126
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,097
>> THE MILITARY.

127
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:33,165
>> Shepard: DO MULTIPLE PEOPLE

128
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:33,966
HAVE CONTROL?

129
00:03:33,966 --> 00:03:35,935
I MEAN, HOW -- ARE THEY GUARDED

130
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:38,671
IN A WAY THAT OTHER NATIONS

131
00:03:38,671 --> 00:03:39,672
NUKES ARE GUARDED?

132
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:40,940
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

133
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,508
>> Shepard: WE DON'T HAVE A

134
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:42,808
CLUE.

135
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,143
>> WE'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH

136
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:45,911
PAKISTAN TO PUT LINKS ON THEIR

137
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,545
NUKES.

138
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:50,716
EVEN THOUGH OUR RELATIONS WITH

139
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:51,650
ISLAMABAD SOMETIMES HAVEN'T BEEN

140
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,385
GOOD BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD THE

141
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,588
SAME RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH

142
00:03:55,588 --> 00:03:57,489
KOREA AND SECURING LOOSE NUKES.

143
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,224
>> Shepard: SO THERE'S A REAL

144
00:03:59,224 --> 00:04:02,595
WORRY OF A MISSTEP OR A ROGUE

145
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:04,196
ACTOR DOING SOMETHING THAT COULD

146
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:05,764
START A CONFLICT THAT COULD

147
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:07,066
QUICKLY ESCALATE.

148
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,068
>> THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IF THE

149
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:10,636
MILITARY WAS SO UNHAPPY WITH KIM

150
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:12,004
THAT THEY GOT RID OF HIM.

151
00:04:12,004 --> 00:04:14,039
THEN YOU'D SEE THE MILITARY

152
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:14,373
DIVIDE.

153
00:04:14,373 --> 00:04:16,208
YOU'D HAVE CHINA IN THERE AS

154
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:16,575
WELL.

155
00:04:16,575 --> 00:04:17,709
IT WOULD BE A SITUATION WHICH WE

156
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,312
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT.

157
00:04:20,312 --> 00:04:21,747
THAT IS OUR NIGHTMARE SCENARIO

158
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:23,248
AND PROBABLY CHINA'S AS WELL.

159
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:25,584
CHINA DOES HAVE LINKS INTO THE

160
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:27,820
NORTH KOREAN MILITARY.

161
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,090
THEY'VE HAD THEM FOR DECADES.

162
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,524
THE KIM FAMILY HAS HAD LINKS

163
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:33,759
WITH CHINA AND THEN CHINA BUYS

164
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,727
MORE GENERALS.

165
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:37,029
IT'S A VERY INTERESTING PROCESS.

166
00:04:37,029 --> 00:00:00,000
THE POINT IS, WE'RE ON THE
