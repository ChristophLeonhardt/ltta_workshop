♪ ♪ ♪ Tucker: GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. THE NEWS STACKS UP AND WE FINALLY GET ANSWERS. WE HAVE SOME TONIGHT. AFTER YEAR OF RESEARCH AND INTERVIEWS THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS FINALLY CONCLUDED ITS INVESTIGATION INTO THIS RUSSIAN MEDDLING DURING THE 2016 ELECTION THAT YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT. THE FINAL REPORT IS OUT. IT'S MORE THAN 200 PAGES LONG. HERE'S THE HEADLINE. INVESTIGATORS FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION OF ANY KIND BETWEEN THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AND THE DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT CAMPAIGN. NONE. SO THAT'S BAD NEWS FOR THE OTHER CABLE CHANNELS. THEY PROBABLY OUGHT TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE ENTIRE LAST YEAR OF THEIR PROGRAMMING BUT OBVIOUSLY DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. BUT TO THE REST OF US, THERE IS REALLY NO SURPRISE HERE BECAUSE THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION. IT WAS ALWAYS A FANTASY. BY THE WAY, THE REPORT DOES NOT OFFER ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT DIRECTED THE HACKING OF THE DNC SERVERS OR JOHN PODESTA'S G MAIL ACCOUNT EITHER. TO THIS DAY, THOUGH NO ONE EVER SAYS IT, NO ONE HAS EVER CAME UP WITH ANY PROOF THAT HAPPENED DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALL REQUIRED TO BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED OR ELSE WE ARE RUSSIAN AGENTS OURSELVES BUT WHATEVER. THERE IS NOT A LOT NEW ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IN THIS REPORT. THERE IS QUITE A BIT ABOUT HOW WASHINGTON ACTUALLY WORKS. CONSIDER FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE JIM CLAPPER. FOR YEARS, CLAPPER WAS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL INTELLIGENCE CHIEFS IN THE WORLD. NOW IS HE A CABLE NEWS SHOUTER AND POLITICAL ACTIVIST. HE IS ALSO A PROLIFIC LIAR. ACCORDING TO TODAY'S REPORTS IN SWORN TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS, UNDER OATH. CLAPPER CLAIMED THAT HE NEVER DISCUSSED THE STEELE DOSSIER WITH ANYONE IN THE PRESS. THAT'S UNTRUE. THE REPORT REVEALED THAT CLAPPER WHISPERED TO CNN ABOUT THE STEELE DOSSIER AND MONTHS LATER, OF COURSE, THE NETWORK HIRED HIM AS A CONTRIBUTOR. HE STILL IS ONE. YESTERDAY JIM COMEY TOLD OUR FRIEND BRET BAIER THAT CLAPPER ENCOURAGED HIM TO DISCUSS THE DOSSIER WITH THE PRESIDENT. THAT BRIEFS WAS LATER USED BY CNN AND OTHER MEDIA OUTLETS TO JUSTIFY REPORTING ON THES TO YEA. AND SO ON IN THE CIRCULAR FASHION WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR THE LAST YEAR. IN OTHER WORDS, THE WHOLE THING WAS A SETUP FROM THE BEGINNING. NO ONE EVER BELIEVED THE DOES QUAY WAS TRUE OR CARED IF IT WAS TRUE. IT WAS ALWAYS JUST A TOOL DESIGNED TO HAMSTRING THE ADMINISTRATION THAT PERMANENT WASHINGTON OPPOSED FROM DAY ONE. TRUMP WAS ON TO THIS ACTUALLY FROM THE BEGINNING. HE COULDN'T REALLY EXPLAIN IT, BUT HE COULD SMELL IT, WHICH IS HIS ONE GREAT TALENT AND HE WAS RIGHT. OF COURSE, HE WAS ATTACKED MERCILESSLY FOR SUGGESTING THE SO-CALLED INTEL COMMUNITY MIGHT NOT BE ON THE LEVEL. HOW DARE HE DO THAT HE YELPED ON CNN. THEY ARE PUBLIC SERVANTS DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO KEEPING YOU SAFE BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. ACTUALLY SOME OF THEM ARE PEOPLE. SOME ARE GREAT PEOPLE. SOME ROTTEN AND UNETHICAL. SOME WOULD USE LEAKS, DECEPTION AND INTEND DOUGH TO REVERSE RESULTS OF AN ELECTION. MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THIS THAT'S WHY THE PHRASE DEEP STATE IS SUDDENLY PART OF THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION. JOHN BRENNAN IS PART OF THE REASON BY THE WAY. BRENNAN IS THE FORMER HEAD OF THE CIA AND LIKE JIRMT CLAMMER IS ENTHUSIASTIC LIAR. LIKE CLAPPER HE HAS BEGUN SECOND CAREER AS LEGAL ANALYST. BRENNAN DENOUNCED THE ENTIRE THING AS MEANINGLESS. HE THEN SAID THIS ON TWITTER DIRECTLY TO THE PRESIDENT, QUOTE THE: THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S FINDINGS WILL BE COMPREHENSIVE AND AUTHORITATIVE, STAY TUNED, MR. TRUMP. HE AUDITED HE AUDIT AN ELLIPSIS TO MAKE IT EXTRA OMINOUS, WHICH IT WAS. OKAY. SO THE LONG-TIME CHIEF OF A SHADOWY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IS WARNING THE DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED PRESIDENT OF OUR COUNTRY THAT SOMETHING BAD IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN TO HIM. APPARENTLY BECAUSE JOHN BRENNAN HAS INSIDE KNOWLEDGE THE REST OF US DON'T. BUT DON'T LET THAT BOTHER YOU. DON'T GET PARANOID OR ANYTHING. DON'T BUY ANY OF THOSE NUTTY CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THE DEEP STATE. EVERYTHING IS FINE. JUST BE SURE TO OBEY OUT PERMANENT GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON OR ELSE GOONS LIKE JOHN BRENNAN WILL CRUSH YOU. TERRY TURCHIE IS FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTER TERRORISM. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY SENIOR EDITOR AT THE FEDERALIST. THEY JOIN US TONIGHT. MOLLIE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? WHAT'S THE TAKE AWAY. THEY FOUND AFTER A YEAR OF RIGOROUS INVESTIGATION THERE IS NO ACTUAL EVIDENCE OF TREASONOUS COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. THAT'S PROBABLY THOUGHT VERY SURPRISING. WHAT THEY DID SHOW WAS THAT THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF COLLUSION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO COOK UP AND PROPAGATE A NARRATIVE OF RUSSIAN COLLUSION. WE HAD ALREADY LEARNED FROM THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE FISA ABUSE AT DOJ WHERE THEY USED A RESEARCH DOCUMENT BOUGHT AND PAID FOR SECRETLY BY HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE TO SECURE A WIRETAP ON A TRUMP CAMPAIGN AFFILIATE. AND THEN YOU PICKED UP ON THIS OTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING. JAMES CLAPPER GAVE CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY UNDER OATH ABOUT WHAT HE WAS LEAKING TO CNN. AND THAT IS INTERESTING. THE WHOLE THING THAT GOT EVERYTHING GOING WAS THIS BRIEFING OF PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, SUPPOSEDLY ABOUT THE DOSSIER. WE LATER LEARNED IT WAS ONLY ABOUT ONE SALACIOUS PART OF THE DOSSIER. THIS WAS HIGHLY PLACED. THIS WAS WELL-SOURCED. OBVIOUSLY. IT LOOKS LIKE IT WENT TO CLAPPER OR SOMEONE CLOSE TO HIM AND LEARNING THAT THIS WAS ALL DONE, THAT COMEY WAS ASKED TO BRIEF PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP ON THIS DOSSIER AND THAT THIS WAS DONE BECAUSE CNN NEEDED A NEWS HOOK IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY WRITING ABOUT A DOSSIER. THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING DETAIL TO LEARN AND SHOULD PUT A LOT OF THE COVERAGE THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE LAST 15 MONTHS IN AN ENTIRELY NEW LIGHT. Tucker: I MEAN, TERRY, YOU SPENT A LOT OF YOUR LIFE WORKING FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THAT HAS INTELLIGENCE COMPONENTS TO IT THE CREDIBILITY OF THE AGENCY, I'M SURE IS IMPORTANT TO YOU. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME AS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. NONE OF THIS SEEMS TO HELP. I MEAN, IF THERE IS NO COLLUSION AT THE BOTTOM OF ALL OF THIS, THEN ALL OF THIS IS STARTING TO LOOK VERY POLITICAL AND THAT'S BAD FOR THE WAY CITIZENS FEEL ABOUT THEIR GOVERNMENT. ISN'T IT? ABSOLUTELY AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, THE REAL DANGEROUS PART OF THIS AND THE PART THAT SHOULD SCARE EVERY ONE OF US, YOU JUST NAMED THEM. THE HEADS OF THE MAJOR INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, THE CIA AND THE FBI AND THE NSA, AWFUL THESE PEOPLE AT THE TOP APPEAR TO HAVE HAD JUST ONE GOAL IN MIND. AND THAT WAS TO BE ANTI-TRUMP AND TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR HIM AFTER HE BECAME THE PRESIDENT. I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT ALL OF THIS IDEA OF UNMASKING, FOR EXAMPLE, DIDN'T REALLY START UP UNTIL AFTER HE BECAME ELECTED. AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY THOUGHT AND I THINK MOLLIE AND YOU AND I WOULD NOT BE SITTING HERE TODAY AND TALKING HAD HILLARY CLINTON
