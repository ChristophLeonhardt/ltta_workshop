very excited about this
this is the new first class suite on
Emirates this is the comprehensive
review of that suite
I mean it's about proper a heavy big
wooden door now more like a small but
extremely elegant hotel room than it
does an airplane seat you got your seat
which is also a bed you've got closets
two TVs and a door here that opens and
closes it goes all the way yes thank you
are they taking off now
taking off
let me begin with a proper tour of the
entire suite bedroom is always a big
deal when flying and the legroom and
this the legroom borders on ridiculous
ready you can fit a small family down
here this is just the leg reading
situation if you were 7 or 8 feet tall
you couldn't use up all this legroom if
you were a circus clown wearing stilts
you couldn't use up all this legroom so
there are these little lights these
little lights in the carpet look I found
a TV situation here is amazing
you get one gigantic screen right there
that's like I don't know 35 inches 40
inches something like that that's one TV
and then you've got another thing over
here but these two aren't connected so
on your big TV you watching Pulp Fiction
and then on the iPad here you can do
other stuff
here we can see what happens with this
I don't need anything I just wanted to
see if this worked nice to see you this
is so unnecessary thank you see you no I
don't I don't need anything I'm gonna go
see her all right thank you
vanity mirror
and then so far I found two closets one
here this one appears to be for like
suits or jackets or anything like that I
didn't bring any suits so I so I just
put my skateboard in here then kind of
under the TV there's this big Locker and
this one's pretty massive I've got my
backpack in here but you can probably
put a rolling suitcase or it's big you
know like put my head in here
I think I think I'm done with this
portion of the meal it was very good I
couldn't finish it I was too much stuff
staking a few bit of the sunset but not
a lot of it if you want to
be fantastic so what are these these are
just like TV screens so these are just
like LCD screens of what's going on out
there
those are cameras where look like
Oh
now this isn't the long-haul flight of
the a380 which has the showers and the
gigantic spa on it but this is a nice
bathroom is it very comfortable I don't
work this is turkey or air fresh never
both Gary 11 bars of soap I don't know
what you would need eleven bars of soap
or but they have eleven bars and so
cloth towels that's it I'm gonna go back
to my back to my room
now this seat itself is supposed to be
pretty magical this is the standard
takeoff and landing position
a dining position
this is something called zero gravity
where it's supposed to make it feel like
this is very nice
she told me that when I was ready to go
to bed that I had to get her and she
would make the bed
I will now attempt to fly my drone
inside this airplane
really was all it was cracked up to be
it was everything I ever wanted
I can see every
