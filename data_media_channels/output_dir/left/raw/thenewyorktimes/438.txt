00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,904
Welcome to the Baltimore City
Police Crime Lab

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:06,673
firearms reference collection.

3
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,908
I'm Jim Wagster. I'm a 
firearms examiner 

4
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:11,344
at the Baltimore City
Police Department.

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,646
This reference collection is
all firearms

6
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,315
that were recovered 
off the street.

7
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,952
Every year we get approximately
3,000 firearms in.

8
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:21,788
Sometimes a little more,
sometimes it's a little less,

9
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,058
but the average being right
around 3,000.

10
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,460
to my right here is just a
collection of some

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,729
of the semiautomatics.

12
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,466
They run from a Beretta,
like was issued to

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,270
the military and a lot of the
police departments,

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:42,642
and also down to German 
World War II firearms.

15
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:47,180
This is a more modern 12 gauge
pump action shotgun. 

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:51,217
It's more representative of
what we get in now.

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,821
Behind me is a collection of
semiautomatics.

18
00:00:54,821 --> 00:01:00,226
They run from .25s, .32s, 
.380s, 9 millimeters.

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,430
And this is just typical of the
smaller type caliber 

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:00:00,000
semiautomatic pistols.
