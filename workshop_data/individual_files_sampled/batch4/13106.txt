I'm Andrew Klavan and this is my new story another Kingdom performed by Michael Knowles so far on another Kingdom Hollywood nobody Austin Lively has been transported from Los Angeles to the sword & Sworcery land of Galliano where he's beaten and accused of murdering a woman in a locked room but before he can be taken from the castle dungeon to stand trial he finds himself just as suddenly back in LA while being nursed back to health by his friends Skylar Cohen and Jane Janeway he runs an internet search for Galliano and finds that it's a country in a novel called another Kingdom a novel he may have read now episode 3 my hunting blood was up now something weird had happened to me something very weird mega weird the hallucination or dream or whatever it was the head wound and now a novel with the place-names Galliano and Easter a minute just like in the dream it felt like I was close to finding an explanation for my experience close and yet impossibly for because I couldn't imagine what explanation there could be but whatever it was I wanted to find out needed to another Kingdom by Ella Nevermore I needed to get home I used my or go ride share app to call for a car then moving slowly like an old man I swung my feet down onto the floor I found my shoes slipped them on I tried to stand but the room began tossing and tilting again i sat back on the bed hard my stomach dropping I stayed there a few moments drawing deep breaths I knew I must have a concussion I knew I ought to go to a doctor or at least lie back down and rest it was awfully tempting to think of staying here for a few more hours even a day or two Jane would sit with me sometimes she would feed me soup Schuyler couldn't hang around forever I pushed myself up and staggered from the room I heard voices as I came down the hallway toward the front door I passed Jaynes home office and peeked in the room was empty the lights were out she was gone I was disappointed the voices were coming from the living room up ahead I continued down the hall and went in there it was an elegant colorful room a wagon wheel chandelier hung down from a dark wooden beam ceiling the sofa and stuffed chairs below were bright sherbet colors red and green everything was arranged around a tall white fireplace high arched windows made the space airy and light a television was on that's where the voices were coming from some daytime talk show loud women and lots of applause at first I thought there was no one watching but then I saw Skylar I saw the red top of her head anyway she was splayed in harmoniously in the armchair right in front of me her feet on the Ottoman one hand holding a beer balanced on her bellybutton bare where her black t-shirt didn't quite meet her black leggings she had her back to me as she watched the program she didn't look around when I stepped into the open archway I thought she didn't know I was there then she said Jane had to go to the big house the big house that was where Alexis Merriweather and David Thune usually lived when they were in town Jane had shown me pictures of it a massive estate you could have seen from the moon she told me to make you soup if you woke up Skylar said that's all right I said I'm not hungry I called a car good because I'm not making any fucking soup I smiled I nodded though she couldn't see me I felt for her I started to sidle away toward the door why don't you make your move you dumb shit she asked me you can see she loves you well that made me pause I searched for an answer a true answer but I didn't know what the answer was I wasn't sure how I felt I guess and you don't make a move on Jane Jane away unless you're ready unless you're sure but before I could say even that Skylar said Christ sweets a cost in a girl like that she'd serve you all her fucking days isn't that what men want I felt the sting was I so selfish of course but somehow I managed not to say hey it's what you want too isn't it you're obviously crazy about her you're not man enough that's your problem she said that hurt too because I suspected it might be so and on another day I might have barked back neither are you if it comes down to it but somehow I managed not to say that either she swings her beer you're just another wannabe artiste counting the days until you sell out and get a job wow that was merciless Jesus but even now I felt for her even now I managed not to say well what the hell are you then Schuyler belched you know what she said to the TV screen in the old fairy tales you know how the beautiful princess gets the handsome prince and people read that shit and they think well why doesn't that happen to me you know why you know it doesn't because they're not princesses they're not princes that's why they're just messed up freaks who want the world to make-believe they're beautiful and give them a happy ending they haven't earned and that's you Austin you're not what you want to be you're not who you ought to be and you're not what Jane deserves so go fuck yourself all right I was reeling from the blows but I was swamped with pity for her as well because I knew it wasn't just me she was talking about it was her too maybe it was the whole stupid wannabe City were all so lost here all of us wobbly and sick I moved slowly out of the archway to her chair and stood above her looking down she lifted her angry cherub face to me her cheeks were flushed her eyes glassy don't pat yourself on the back for being kind to me she said I can hear what you're thinking I reached down and lifted her free hand off the chair arm I raised it to my lips and kissed it thank you for helping me back at Hitchcock Skye you're a good friend if you don't let go of my hand right now I'm gonna use it to rip your fucking heart out my apartment was an attic space and a charmless complex of concrete towers its sole redeeming feature was a window near my writing desk that looked out on the street from there I could see the spillover crowd in the parking lot and back of the corner bar the no hole come Saturday night if someone out there screamed or broke a bottle I could look down and check on the noise and watch a couple of drunken louts shoving one another before they wandered off home other than that it was two small rooms with aggressively low ceilings the bedroom was so small that when I unfolded the sofa into a futon there was no space to walk around it on either side the living room / kitchenette where the precious window was was filled by the writing in a couple of chairs I set my laptop up on the table I was raring to start my search but before I could I had to sit and rest a moment leaning my elbow on the table squeezing my eyes shut with my hand when the concussion nausea passed I went to work I searched my computer for the title another Kingdom nothing then for the author Ella Nevermore nothing again i sat and stared at the screen frustrated I was beginning to doubt myself maybe I hadn't read the book for Mythos maybe I had heard the word Galliano somewhere else in a desperation move I tried the computer's trash files and there it was a page I discarded another Kingdom I opened it it was coverage all right or that is it was the beginning of a coverage report I hadn't finished there was nothing there but the company formed the lines you fill out before you write your outline in your review another Kingdom form novel genre fantasy author Ellen ever more coverage Austen lively submitted to candy philocan submitted by Sean Gunther plot line murder intrigue betrayal and love

irons wife one time lady-in-waiting to Queen aleena lady cot Apple of Lady Beth Ray's friend one time that was it one page no plot outline no report the abrupt ending nothing else why hadn't I finished it I checked the documents date it had been created three months ago it was just starting summer them I tried to think back something stirred in my memory candy had sent me an e-book as part of the usual package had started reading it but before could finish something happened I couldn't remember what I searched for the title in my email files found it an email from candy austin hope this catches you before you read another kingdom the submission has been withdrawn so we don't have to bother with it sorry CF I didn't remember what I'd done with the book after that but I'd almost surely deleted it I deleted all of the books after I'd read them why wouldn't I I stood up from the desk the room did a slow sickening roll around me I cursed I had to reach out and grab the back of an armchair so I could lower myself into it close my eyes rest sitting there like that I tried to remember more about the book but there was nothing nothing certainly that would explain what had happened to me in the Edison building maybe candy still had a copy I thought doubtful after three months but she might or she might remember something about it or something about the man who had submitted it Sean Gunther that name sounded familiar too if I hadn't felt so lousy I might have been able to remember taking a deep breath to steady myself I worked my way out of the chair again back to the desk again I got my phone I dialed candy I gazed out the window as I listened to the ringing on the other end of the line that was the first time I saw the black Mustang it was parked at the curb in the red no parking zone next to the no whole lot a racy old school machine yet black and shiny I didn't take much notice of it not right away not yet it was just something to gaze at idly while I waited for Ken Candy's assistant to answer the phone I did notice the driver though kind of a strange-looking guy or a strange-looking girl I wasn't actually sure which he or she had boycot blonde hair but a small round face with kitten ish female features he had a narrow girlie body from what I could see of it but a bared bicep on his visible arm with muscles that had to be a man's collar ahem them for convenience sake that was all I took in before Ken picked up the line he said he'd see if he could find candy which men he'd asked her if she thought I was worth speaking to I guess I was I was still looking down at the driver of the Mustang when she came on the line Austin she said curtly I was just a reader after all I'd already had my weekly meeting what did I want now is there a problem with the assignments no look I'm sorry to bother you candy I said I turned away from the window to focus I already had my story ready I was just checking my records and I found an unfinished report for a book called another Kingdom I was worried I hadn't completed the assignment do you remember that one G nope I'm sure if it was important I'd have asked for it it was submitted by a guy named Sean Gunther I said oh oh yeah sure he's a pal of Henry's Henry Quint was the head of mythos Candy's boss he was like some big writer back in the day like a million years ago or something as she went on talking I searched a gun through his name on my laptop Henry talks about him a lot I guess he wrote this one famous novel at some point and he was like the flavor of the month then he did that Hollywood thing they do you know where he came out here hoping to score the big bucks and he took a lot of meetings and people fond over him and it was all sweet and dreamy except the years went by and nothing he wrote got made and then people stopped hiring him so by the time he decided to sit down and write something again his glory days were over nobody cared anymore what he did Gunter's Wikipedia entry came up on the screen there was his picture a noble countenance haloed by a leonine mane of silver white hair his first novel a thousand pages of self referential drivel had been shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize thirty years ago kandi went on he sent this another Kingdom thing to Henry because he wanted to adapt it for the movies it was supposed to be this big comeback or whatever it was a mercy read basically Henry was just being nice to a friend right only you pulled it before I finished the coverage right right right now I remember Gunther got cold feet about the whole thing and decided he didn't want to go through with it I think the guy's basically an old drunk you know Henry humors him because they were friends back when dinosaurs roamed the earth you don't still have a copy of that book around do you know why again I had my story prepared when I stumbled on the coverage I remember how much I liked what I read I was thinking if Gunther doesn't want to do anything with it maybe I would you don't happen to have his contacts do you I'd like to ask him if he'd let me read it again I'll have Ken check with Gunther and get permission to send you his info candy said I thanked her and hung up I turned back to the window glanced out thinking and there was the black Mustang the kittenish man behind the wheel looked away quickly as if I'd almost caught him staring up at me what the hell I thought was he watching my apartment but before I could think much more about it my phone buzzed again a video call this time my kid sister Riley in every family drama each person has a role to play in my family my older brother Richard was the big success my parents pride and joy me well I guess I was the misguided wastrel frittering away my life in Hollywood until I came to my senses and got a real job or went back to school Riley though she was the lost sheep the lost cause no one really had any hope for her future not even me and I loved her like crazy I took her call on my computer so I could see her on the bigger screen there she was as she almost always was when she called me lying tummy down on her unmade bed her legs bent at the knees so that her tiny feet and their ankle socks waggled up in the air behind her she was only three years younger than I was but she seemed a childlike creature small with straw yellow hair she wore in braided pigtails and a round cute face that got all pinched and wrinkled when she was upset like a baby's face when she's about to cry her body was more a girl's body than a woman's with no shape to speak of and she always wore tattered jeans and baggy t-shirts that gave her a gammy and charm I couldn't look at her without wanting to feed her and tuck her into bed as I had actually done for her sometimes when she was younger and my professor mom and professor dad couldn't be bothered to do the parenting now whenever I heard from her I worried it was trouble and a lot of times it was the same girlish vulnerability I found endearing in her was a magnet to the sort of men who wanted to use her and mistreat her which sadly enough seemed to be just the sort of men she was attracted to she always seemed to have one of these nasty creeps hanging around her and I was the one who got the weepy phone call after he left and before his successor moved in hey I said what happened to your head she asked nothing I tripped on the curb and bumped it it looks worse than it is I'm fine what's wrong with you who said anything was wrong you only call me when something's wrong that's so untrue okay how's everything everything sucks she said and she kicked one little foot pedal II into the mattress I hate our parents which means you're out of money again and they won't give you any no that's such a shitty thing to say Austin I rolled my eyes all right yes she said but it's still shitty to say Riley lived up north near our parents she had a job or a sort of job as an actress at the happy town theme park near Walnut Creek in summer she played a farm girl their welcoming kids to the petting zoo while the dads stole glances at the back of her cutoff jeans in autumn now she was a ghoul in the funhouse jumping out at passers-by in winter she waited tables but whatever the time of year happy town was only weekend work meant to supplement her true vocation Riley was a video maker she recorded and starred in a series of videos called aura Burroughs dark dreams of reality in the videos she lay on her unmade bed just as she was doing now except for the circular design framing her she looked into the camera on her phone and spun conspiracy theories out of stories she'd read online these theories involved aliens from outer space and an international cabal of plotters variously called the Illuminati or the Templars the Templars were helping the aliens take over the earth they the Templars or maybe the aliens I'm not sure thought alien government would be better for us humans because the aliens had superior intelligence but it was clear they wanted power for its own sake too and that ultimately they meant to enslave us all the theory is ensured were crazy and ridiculous and though she explained them with a straight face I could never tell I'm not sure she could tell whether she was serious about any of it or not either way for some reason don't ask me why people seem to like her stuff her vids got tens of thousands of hits hundreds of thousands sometimes enough viewers to win her site the sponsors and subscribers she needed to supplement her happy town money and help her make the rent but somehow for Riley even that was never enough maybe it was the man or just her own recklessness but she was constantly broke constantly asking her parents for money most of the time they helped her out if only to keep her from moving back in with them but sometimes who's the guy I asked her because when our parents refused to send cash it was usually because they didn't like Riley's latest nightmare of a boyfriend it's not always about the guy said Riley then she said his name is Marco and she coyly twined her stocking feet together and smiled at someone standing behind her camera on cue Marco entered the picture he plopped down on the mattress beside her and gave her a smack on the backside a gesture of ownership she clearly enjoyed it made me wince plus the guy looked like a drug dealer assuming he wasn't something worse like a pimp or a hitman or a serial killer he was long and sinewy with blue ink tats on his neck chest and arms all of which were visible because he wasn't wearing a shirt he looked aggressively good shirtless too with his washboard abs folded neatly into the enormous silver belt buckle at the front of his jeans he had long shaggy hair and long vulpine features and olive skin like some brand of Latino he smiled at me as he left his hand resting on Riley's bottom it was a domineering and insinuating smile a strong man to a weak man smile and I have my hand on your sisters bottom smile the bastard Austin this is Marco Marco Austin Riley said isn't he cool she added fondly rubbing her head against him as if she were a kitten Jesus Riley I said of course mom and dad won't give you money what did you expect it's not because of Marco of course it's because of Marco look at him Marco smiled wider showing me his white predatory teeth well okay they do hate him Riley said affectionately but it's the vids they're angry about they say they're not going to help me anymore until I stop posting them they say I'm embarrassing them well I could believe that my folks had worked their way out of a Midwestern nowhere my father now held the prestigious Orosco chair in psychology Berkeley my mother was a professor of sociology there they were covetous of their academic status and proud of their elegant intellectual friends I'm sure it was difficult enough for them when people asked and what is your other son doing but Riley in her videos it is because she is getting too close to the truth Marco chimed in at this point he had a deep belief Luis voice with a fake sounding Latin Lover accent he was the whole bad news package all right no wonder Riley adored him yeah too close to the truth I said that must be it Marco was a documentary filmmaker in Venezuela during the collapse Reilly said proudly he saw my videos online and came to help me I bet he did we are very close to exposing the old conspiracy now my friend he said and he lifted his hand off my sister's butt long enough to indicate the books on the Shelf on the wall behind them there were books with purple bindings and yellow lettering white bindings and rainbow lettering and one enormous tome with scarlet leather binding an inlaid gold lettering my experience as a reader told me these were the sorts of designs publishers reserved for nutty diatribes about UFOs and Templars and crystals and the like we just need a little more time Riley wheedled if they would just give us enough to live on for a few more months we'll be famous Riley could you ask Richard for us please Richard won't give you money if mom and dad won't but he'll argue with mom and dad if you ask him to they love him and he loves you and you love me that's how our family operates I was about to ask who do you love Riley but then Marco replaced his hand on her backside and gave me his toothy grin again so that answered that Riley rolled over and pressed the back of her head into Marcos bare belly please Austin she repeated she stretched the words out as far as they would go I looked at her sprawled on her side with her t-shirt bunched up to expose her bare belly and her jeans torn to show the white flesh high on one thigh I'll think about it I said i gestured toward marco meanwhile dump this clown he's trash marco grinned even wider the bastard I broke the connect I cooked myself some eggs then lay down on the sofa and slept again when I woke up the light was fading from the small patch of sky visible from the bedroom window i sat up my dizziness was gone my head felt better my mind was clearer I touched the bump on my head and it felt smaller less sore maybe the worst effects of the concussion were passing I picked my phone off the floor and checked my mail Ken the assistant had sent me Shaun gun through his contact info email phone number and home address charged up on the hunt again I went back into the living room i sat down at my desk and began to write Gunter an email but what should I say exactly dear mr. Gunter yesterday I was transported into an alternate reality and I was wondering haha no there was no way to explain this an email I decided to phone him he picked up on the 3rd ring a gruff voice yeah mr. Gunter yeah my name is Austin Lively I oh yeah come on over he hung up I took the phone from my ear and looked at it I thought ok that was weird i sat at my desk pondering gazing out the window then I noticed the black Mustang was still there that was kind of weird too wasn't it the car just sitting in the no parking zone all this time the driver with the girly kitten face and the big muscle man arm just sitting there I wondered about it another second or two then shrugged it off the important thing was I was getting somewhere now closer to the book another Kingdom closer to an explanation for what had happened to me maybe Shaun Gunther had some of the answers I got up to go I grabbed my denim jacket off the back of a chair I slipped it on as I walked to the apartment door then I walked out and I let out a wild shout of horror oh no suddenly two guards had me gripped by the arms and I was being hustled up the dungeon steps to face my trial for murder it was a brutal shock a hammer blow to the belly knocking the air and life right out of me why hadn't it occurred to me I might through another door and find myself swept back into Galliano because shit like that doesn't happen that's why I still didn't really believe it had happened to me the first time and to find myself back here in manacles again facing murder charges again the jolt of despair was so sudden it was nearly crippling was I going nuts or was this real why hadn't I gotten that brain scan while I had the chance one of the guards gave me a rough shove come on let's go hurry up stop stalling the man in the red vest walked ahead of us leading the way sir era vez Tim the captain of the guard even in the world of hopelessness and confusion I knew his name now I remembered it from the character list in my computer we reached the top of the stairs we went down a short stone hallway pushed through a heavy set of doors I prayed that crossing the threshold would transport me back to Los Angeles and save me no such luck we came into a small chamber a cohort of guards were waiting for us there all with their swords drawn why then a sound reached me and I understood it was the sound of a mob just outside an angry mob people shouting chanting bring him out bring us the murderer murder conspiracy will strangle him with his own guts I looked around wide-eyed at the guards surrounding me I swallowed horn wait are they screaming for me no one answered no one even looked my way the guards focused only on sara vez Tim sir Arabist said keep him surrounded don't let him get at him let's go no wait wait I said the captain pushed through the doors and the guards marched me out after him there is let him get out of our way everything was chaos noise in motion I was in a courtyard a square of sky above me stone walls rising on every side I was jostled hard rough faces contorted and purple with murderous rage lunged at me over the guards shoulders hands reached from he grabbed at me clawed the space in front of my eyes the mobs roar filled the air like the roar of a surging sea pushed and shoved the cohort of guards veered and stumbled left and then right carrying me with them with my hands manacled behind me I had to fight to keep my balance I could barely see beyond backs and shoulders angry faces and glimpses of the tossing sky it occurred to me in jumbled flashes of panicky thought that I could die here really die right here in this ridiculous fairyland I'd been smacked with the flat of a sword here and the bruise was still on my head when I returned to LA so wouldn't I be dead in LA if I was torn to pieces by this mob or tried and condemned and executed and what if almost worse what if I was sentenced to life in the dungeon what if I never got a chance to pass through another doorway and could never return to my life at home what I rot away in my cell chained to the wall dying in this dream while I dreamed of my lost life in Hollywood Burnham draw and quarter him let us have him murderer well cut him to pieces the crowd kept roaring the faces and hands kept trying to get at me the guards kept shoving their way through carrying me along with them it wasn't far thank God the trip across the courtyard couldn't have been more than 20 yards after a few terrifying moments two massive dark wood doors loomed high above me just ahead the doors swung open as the guards fought their way to them the mob charged us one last time the guards stumbled into me hands reached contorted faces screamed there were curses there were clawing fingers there were flashing silver blades that back.you animos then I was hurried through the doors and the doors swung shut behind me with a boom the guards sheathed their swords and stepped away from me my hands still manacled I bent forward panting for breath then slowly I straightened I looked up I was in a small but majestic courtroom lit by fire by torches flaming from sconces and candles burning in the rims of chandeliers in oaken boxes of teared spectator benches to my left and right lords and ladies and priestly types and who knows who else at looking down at me their pitiless expressions flared and darkened in the shifting light and shadow behind them wooden strips made Chevron's on the yellow walls above them shields and battle axes formed cornices beneath the dark wood ceilings like the eyes of the spectators the murderous blades caught the orange fire glow and reflected it back to me straight ahead at the end of a long broad aisle was a high judges bench it was an awful sight towering almost to the rafters a rampant red dragon was carved into the front of it six feet tall at least and seated at the top were too terrifying figures the judges they wore black robes and their eyes burned red from the depths of the cowls that covered their heads and shadowed their faces I took one look at them and I knew I was doomed now two guards gripped my arms and marched me down the aisle between the spectators they brought me to a railing under the high bench and left me there I stood manacled blinking up at the judges sir Arabist hem swaggered up beside me stroking his neat black beard with one hand the thumb of his other hand and soutien Lee hooked in his sword-belt Lord judges of the High Council he said in a soldierly voice that echoed in the reaches of the ceiling I deliver the prisoner Austin lively to be tried for the murder of lady cuttable of the room was deathly silent then there was not even a curious murmur the two judges way up there above me solemnly nodded their hooded heads the one to the left spoken the gravely voice of an old man though his face was hidden in shadow and I couldn't tell his age summon Lord nether Dale he said Lord iron nether Dale head of the High Council of the New Republic I remembered his name from the characterless too and even in my days of fear and confusion it occurred to me now how bizarre that was you know that I should have read a name in a fantasy book and that I should be here in Galliano wherever the hell that was and that name should be called as if it were attached to a living man a bell tolled a massive bell tolling massively sonorous Li somewhere in some tower nearby out in the courtyard there was a shuffling sound and I turn to see that everyone in the courtroom was standing the judges and the pitiless lords and ladies and priests and the spectator benches everyone and in came Lord iron he entered from a doorway high up in the wall and moved briskly across a raised platform toward the bench as he went he smiled at someone in the audience and pointed at someone else and smiled at yet another a public man a politician just like the ones we have back home in reality if I held any hope of getting justice here it died right then and there when I saw him he was in his 50s tall and substantial straight-backed and broad shoulders fit and trim he had a thick head of brown blond hair and a handsome confident countenance that went before him like the prow of a ship I could see at a glance he was smart and schemee the master of the place whatever happened here it would be his doing or by his will he was followed close behind by another man a much smaller man very short and very wizened very thin he wore a robe of deep indigo that flowed about his desiccated frame like liquid night he had a face like a raisin with small glittering eyes buried deep in the wrinkled flesh a great tuft of hair rose like a little wave up top a great of beard hung limply from his chin Lord iron settled into his seat between the two other judges and when he sat all the others in the hall the judges and the spectators sat down as well the little man in the indigo cape took up a place directly behind him standing this Tribunal is in session Lord irons said in a voice that was both relaxed and strong casual and yet authoritative he looked down at me from his great height I felt his power over me the power of life and death it made my guts curdle austan lively he said and I hated to hear him speak my name it was disorienting unreal as if my name should have been on the character list on my computer along with his you are charged with stabbing lady cut up a love to death how do you plead I didn't want to answer I didn't want to admit that this was happening that I was actually here but what could I do I'm not guilty I said as forcefully as I could the little gray beard behind Lord iron leaned forward and whispered into the Lord's ear the Lord smiled knowingly and gave a little snort my heart sank doomed summoned Lady Beth right to take the stand he said lady Beth Rey yes I remembered that name from the characterless to like Sir Arabists name and Lord irons and now she was coming here how crazy was this really what the fuck had I become a character in a novel everyone turned and so I turned I saw a small door set in the wall at the rear of the room behind the spectators box the door swung open and out from the darkness within walked a woman into the firelight a woman like no woman I had ever seen before she took my breath away it wasn't just that she was beautiful though she was beautiful she really was she was young in her early 20s at most she had lush raven hair held in bangs on her brow by a silver tiara studded with gems the rest of it spilled with heart-stopping abandonned down the sides of her rose and ivory Valentine of a face her lips were soft and rich and her eyes were brilliant green a golden chain with a round golden locket set off the grace and elegance of her throat her long gown of white and gold draped a shapely figure at once sensual and majestic she was beautiful no question but I lived in LA I saw beautiful women all the time it was more than that that struck me about her it was the grace with which she came down the aisle as if floating on air it was the way she never turned never glanced either left or right at the staring murmuring spectators it was the way she kept her hands clasped beneath her breasts in a position of such modesty and self-contained meant everything about her it was all just so incredibly what was the word womanly so incredibly womanly I watched her walk past me I couldn't stop staring sir Erebus tim opened a gate in the railing for her she inclined her chin half an inch in thanks and passed through I watched her as she climbed up the narrow stairway to the witness box beside the high bench climbed so smoothly she almost seemed to levitate she took her place in the box stood there behind it slow rail erect dignified her hands still clasped before her the witness would state her name Lord iron said my name is Lady Beth reina de deo she answered her voice was like silver bells and your station I'm honored to be your wife my lord Lord iron smiled blandly and it is my great pleasure that you are he said as the watching crowd tittered its approval I thought that's right I remembered that from the character list she was Lord irons wife a recent prize for him I would have bet considering what had to be the 30-year difference in their ages before the fall of the Queen in the rise of the New Republic did you have another station as well Lord iron asked her I did my lord I was lady-in-waiting to Queen aleena and in that capacity you served with Lady cuttable of the victim in this case did you not yes my lord yes I remembered this to lady kata had been lady better A's friend which meant lady Coty's death her murder must have really grieved this woman I couldn't see any signs of grief on her face of course not she was too poised to seemingly serene but I had to wonder was she sorrowful enough to be angry angry enough to want vengeance vengeful enough to assume I was guilty to actively try to condemn me here in her testimony there was a brief pause as once again the wizened graybeard in the wizardly robe leaned forward and whispered in Lord irons ear the politicians large head inclined in agreement then he said lady betray during the time you were lady-in-waiting did you ever have occasion to witness lady kata in a secret meeting with a man I do my lord would you describe that occasion lady better a went on in her silvery voice gazing straight ahead never turning her hands still clasped in front of her I couldn't take my eyes off her she was radiant in her womanly dignity and modesty it happened one evening at the end of summer just at Twilight shortly before the fall of the Queen I was doing my handiwork sitting on the window seat of the ladies chamber in the Queen's quarters in order to catch the last rays of the Sun to see by as the daylight failed I put my work away in its basket I was just preparing to leave when I happen to glance down into the hedge maze in the garden directly below me I saw lady Carter there she was walking in the maze moving toward its center you could identify her even in the fading light Lord iron asked I could my lord there was still light enough and I knew the lady well very well go on I was curious as to what lady Carter was doing in the maze of that hour so I stood and watched for a few moments she made her way to the center and sat on the stone bench in the statue garden there and then and then she waited and it got darker and after a few minutes when it was full night so that I could no longer make out anything of her but her shadow a man approached her you saw him into the maze I did not my lord said lady Bertha ray she spoke into the air before her looking neither to her husband nor anyone else it is my belief he had been standing in one of the mazes alcoves hidden behind a statue I remember it seemed to me as if a statue had come to life and approached her again the little wizard guy hovering behind the bench whispered to Lord iron and again Lord iron nodded please go on lady bath ray the man made his way to the center of the maze and joined lady kata in the Statue garden she said and in what manner did she greet him she lady kata lept from the bench on which she was sitting and rushed into the man's arms even from where I was standing far below her I saw a faint flush of pink tinged the ivory of Lady Beth Ray's cheeks it occurred to me somewhere in the back of my mind that I never seen a woman blush like that before blush because she was speaking about romantic stuff I mean I had only read about women doing that in books but here it was in real life if real life is what this was she embraced him you mean Lord iron said embraced him passionately and then kissed him my Lord kissed him like a relative no my lord they kissed as lovers kiss and for a long time the crowd murmur and Lady Beth raised blush deepened and something about it I don't know what the old-fashioned ladylike modesty of it I guess I don't know but whatever it was I felt it pierced me through like a sword point even here even now Lord iron had one of those gavels without a handle you know that just fit in the palm he banged it on the bench order when the spectators had fallen silent he turned back to his wife Lady Beth ray would you describe to this court your reaction to what you witnessed I was quite startled my lord I was shocked I had always known lady Carter to be a woman of virtue and true religion she was married to Lord gaunt who was still alive at that time and though he was much older than she was and had been sick of late I had always known Carter Lady Carter to be faithful to her vows I had not expected this and did you confront her about her infidelity I did my lord I considered it my duty as a friend I spoke to her in private the very next day and can you describe that conversation lady Carter was in great distress crying grievously she begged me to say nothing to the Queen or to her husband and yet she feared that she would be undone in any case undone because lady kata confessed to me and now for the first time the lady faltered lowering her eyes almost imperceptibly go on my lady she drew a breath and lifted her head willing herself back to composure lady kata confessed to me that she feared she was carrying her lover's child you could hear that pass through the crowd like a bolt of electricity the murmur moving from one end of the hall to other and she knew that it was her lover's child and not her husband's ask Lord iron calmly she did my lord Lord gaunt had been grievously ill for many months as everyone at court was aware lady cutter feared that when her condition became known she would face trial for adultery and she would have said Lord iron the wizard type behind him leaned in again to whisper but he held up his hand to silence him and continued lady beth ray did lady kata confessed you the name of her lover she did my told the lady replied it sounds crazy I know but to that point I had been so hypnotized by her loveliness so wrapped up in the narrative of her testimony so completely convinced down to the bottom of my soul that that narrative had nothing to do with me that it was only in the moment before she answered that I realized with horror what she was going to say until then she had spoken almost without moving her hands clasp before her her eyes straight ahead but now she turned her face just a little just enough so that her piercing green eyes were directly on me she said that her lover was Austin lively what no I shouted I'd always wondered why people in courtroom dramas on TV shout out like that it makes them look so bad I always thought they would be smart enough to control themselves it turns out you can't help it it isn't true I shouted straining against my manacles as a nearby guard grabbed hold of me I never touched her I never met her she isn't I was about to say she isn't even real in my world but Lord iron hammered his palm gavel against the bench and I caught myself brought up he commanded thank you for your testimony Lady Beth Rey he said then you may step down one more thing happened then one more thing I mean to set my whirling mind whirling even faster lady Beth array descended from the witness box floating down the stairs as she had floated up them she glided beneath the judges bench to the railing sir arriviste opened the gate and she glided through and just then just as she was gliding past me close to me near enough to touch me near enough so that I thought I caught a wild a yearning sent from her like the scent of night blooming Jasmine she turned and faced me she looked right into my eyes gazed right into my eyes and as I gawked back my mind's still reeling with horror and bewilderment I saw I couldn't have said just then what I saw just then I was too crazed to figure it out but her gaze struck me like a broad side blow and an image came to life in my mind a memory more than a memory a visceral flashback her lips on mine her soft shape against me and in her eyes I saw well I saw that she loved me this has been another Kingdom by Andrew Klavan
