Trump supporters were not too pleased after NPR tweeted out the Declaration of Independence in bits and pieces now this is something of a tradition for NPR who has been doing it for 29 years now they have been tweeting it out but they've been reading out the Declaration of Independence but when it was broken down into bits and pieces some Trump users were saying that there was some propaganda some bias let's just go to some tweets for the reaction right now so NPR is calling for revolution interesting way to condone the violence while trying to sound patriotic your implications are clear please stop this is not the right place and then my favorite someone responding to this this is Goff miss Frizzle which that's a great Twitter name that deserves to be called out there's nothing more American than getting pissed because you think the Declaration of Independence is on the president that seemed to have been what was going on people thought that falsely they assumed that the Declaration of Independence was calling out current President Trump when in fact it was calling out 1776 monarch King George this is actually taken place in 1951 Wisconsin journalist John Patrick Hunter was reporting for the Capitol Times and he ran into sort of a similar sort of propaganda scare during the Red Scare the reporter typed up the declarations preamble along with six of the ten amendments that make up the Bill of Rights and added the 15th amendment prohibiting racist laws against voting hunter put those foundational American documents into petition form and canvas 112 people at Madison's Independence Day celebration but found only one person insurance agent Wentworth Miller not the actor willing to sign off none of the others Hunter approached would sign and 20 of them accused hunter of being a communist I think this is this is a very interesting story I want to get your take on this is this just a read this is just people not knowing the Declaration of Independence or just looking for propaganda and scare tactics so first just to finish up that 1951 case was just hilarious they weren't alone but Joe McCarthy the guy who was doing the Red Scare said that it was he congratulate the people of Madison for not signing a petition agreeing with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights because he said uh the petition was put out by a commie editor of a communist newspaper yeah so let's enjoy the irony of the Declaration of American Declaration of Independence being communist oh so now back to today here we are again because the Trump supporters called the decorative Declaration of Independence quote trash okay of course they didn't know that it was the Declaration of Independence and then others were like oh that's an interesting coincidence putting out the Declaration of Independence on Independence Day like trying to find the first thought that makes sense in all of this in anyone who would respond like I think this idea is stupid and terrible but not for the reasons as these people are objecting to it I just picture the people who have like Auto notifications on their phone from NPR and then they had get like 140 character at a time updates that are just the Declaration of Independence like that would be so frustrating if your phone just kept going it's like all right NPR stopped like that would make me want to unsubscribe for NPR for NPR's Twitter feed but there's no way that you can get mad at them for communicating the decklid it is it's sort of a tradition for them they're just sort of changing with the times instead of reading it out on the radio they're tweeting it out a lot of people get their news through Twitter I think this makes total sense but a lot of the people who learn about during 1776 instead of apologizing a lot of people were saying I how many people do know the Declaration of Independence is that a valid excuse here instead of saying you know instead of calling themselves out a little bit and realizing that all right let me take this as a sort of a gut check here what was I looking for yeah no it isn't and I'll tell you why because I have it I understand so one of the tweets for example is a quote from the Declaration that says a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people so if you just saw that by itself you might go whoa what's going on here although I would not jump to the conclusion that they were referring to down a Trump when talking about a prince who's a tire I'm and it sounds kind of old-school II I'd be like I wonder where that quote is from maybe I google it before I tweet in a range but if it was a the Obama administration I definitely would not have assumed that they meant the tyrant was Obama but these guys took it a little personally because their sense is that's kind of what we're doing right and so don't call us out on it my favorite was people asking for balance and right one commentator Gizmodo was like should we have put King George's statement of how again how people perceive news delivering organizations right so it's not that they disagree with it's not that they take in any bit of information look at it for what it is instead its source first like they know they disagree with NPR they know that NPR's of the other team they're a liberal news organization in the minds of these Trump supporters so they look to disagree with every single thing that NPR puts out I think that's the dynamic that's most talent I completely agree this sort of reminded me of people backing good job Brett of people backing into their own corners and before they really contextualize what these statements were because again it is a little strange that it is in an older form of English instead of all right let me google this they're like I automatically disagree with this it is exactly what I have this knee-jerk reaction I think it to be and so I'm gonna tweet out this response and then a lot of them got pretty embarrassed and had to eat their own words I think it's great to go back and reread the Declaration of Independence it's pretty amazing like if you take in and kind of parse it out it's like all right we tried with this guy we tried with King George we sent him email and we tried to set up our laws but he keeps avoiding every time we try to contact him and then you pepper in a couple lines about how he's like inciting violence with the merciless Indian savages which is kind of a left turn where they just start talking about Indian savages who kill women and children maybe a right turn yeah a right turn but it is it is great to go back and and kind of reread the Declaration of Independence and hopefully the next step for them and for a lot of people was to do just that to kind of see where it got and Mark like if you think that Trump is this terrible tyrant like it if you read the gripes against King George Trump doesn't seem that bad well we did revolt against King choice so that is that's kind of a high bar right there is stuff in the Declaration of Independence like obstructing laws of naturalization obstructing justice creating judges who are dependent to his will by the way that is why some of the people thought it was about Trump they're like our guy obstructs justice so this must be about him right there is something about calling legislative bodies to strange places that are essentially intended to wear down the will of the public and so when it makes you think of like conducting state business in weird places like mar-a-lago and then also like over twitter why have we chosen that to be the the place we take these kinds of discussions my favorite was that like the idea that this was a conspiracy by NPR it's a kiss versity launched 29 years ago yeah right we know that Donald Trump will be President 29 years from now so we'll pretend that we care about the Declaration of Independence for 28 years yeah and now Wabo will get Trump on the twenty-ninth here and and and the guys are like oh now you're putting this out on Independence Day like gee you I wonder what message you're sending it's like it's what they're exciting the message that it's Independence Day which is named after kind of the Declaration of Independence yeah we're not always talking about you people aren't always trying to make you angry sometimes it's Independence Day and so they're communicating the document that triggered independence well and also just to remember that are you hearing you that the United States was founded on a revolution on speaking truth to power and I think that that's something you know reading from what happened in nineteen was it 51 yeah yeah in 1951 that's another thing that we why are we so afraid of acknowledging that in our court our roots a revolt when there's an abuse of power I think it's kind of beautiful and it's a nice reminder I'm very happy that MPR has this tradition because it's something we do tend to forget and because servers are supposed to be totally in favor of that that don't tread on me and I have the rights government doesn't have the rights again if you read it it's that's exactly what it's saying but apparently it makes you angry these days my I can't wait for next 4th of July when they flip out over Independence Day the movie trying to say about trump is he calling him an alien help us build an independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
