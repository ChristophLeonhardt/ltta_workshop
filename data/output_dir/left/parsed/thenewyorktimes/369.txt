The iPhone.
Released in 2007, Apple's
smartphone has become ingrained
in our day-to-day lives.
From allowing us to access
a search engine at the tap
of a finger to offering us an
entire keyboard full of emojis,
it seems like the iPhone
has created a lot of new
possibilities.
But it's also destroyed things.
You could say the iPhone is
an equal opportunity destroyer
and spares not even itself.
One thing the iPhone
hasn't destroyed--
our desire for more.
