the Boyle family was recently rescued from their Taliban captors in the aftermath there are still more questions than there are answers but don't expect those in the mainstream media to ask the really tough queries well it's been more than a week now since we learned about the plight of Canadian Joshua Boyle and his American wife Caitlyn Coleman now as the story goes Boyle took his very pregnant wife for a backpacking trip to Afghanistan five years ago hey why not even though Caitlin was in our third trimester who wouldn't want to go to one of the most upside down gunned up regimes in the world in order to tiptoe through the tulips what could possibly go wrong well you could get kidnapped by the Taliban which is allegedly what happened while captive Caitlyn's child perished the couple say the child died due to a forced abortion but the Taliban which apparently now operates an ob/gyn division claims the death was due to a miscarriage in any event who knew that the terrorists who comprised the Taliban were such compassionate captors that's because they allowed Joshua and Caitlin to have conjugal visits all of which facilitated the opportunity for the couple to have three count them three children while in captivity and hey why not Joshua told The Associated Press that he and his wife always wanted to have lots of kids and just because they were prisoners in a very nasty regime well that little hiccup wasn't going to derail those Brady Bunch plans said Joshua about starting his dream family quote we're sitting as hostages with a lot of time on our hands we always wanted to as many kids as possible and we didn't want to waste time Kate's in her 30s the clock is ticking end quote well for the sake of argument let's assume he's talking about Kate's biological clock ticking and not something slightly more nefarious now later on their captors eventually moved the family into Pakistan and at the insistence of the US government the Pakistani military was convinced to conduct a raid to rescue the family which they did and they all lived happily ever after right well in the aftermath so many things just don't add up and the mainstream media doesn't appear to want to do any invest of journalism on this issue for fear of coming across as being oh I don't know culturally insensitive well thank goodness for Tareq Fattah who's never been beholden to the tyranny of political correctness in a recent schwa no son calm about the boil incident Fatah notes that quote one problem is that non-muslim journalists today are so scared of being labeled racist that obvious questions arising from boils account of his and his family's captivity aren't being asked end quote two things strike Fatah as being downright weird about this story first was the rapid modification in Boyle's appearance Boyle's new beard in particular was a note as its quote a trademark of devout Muslims and even political Islamists as well Boyle describes himself as a pilgrim Fatah notes this reference was missed by most journalists who apparently don't know that most Muslim places of pilgrimage are in Saudi Arabia Turkey Iran in India and hut the valleys of Afghanistan's Wardak province finally Boyle says he went to Wardak province with a sense of mission and to help people fix things fix things what things well he wouldn't elaborate now oddly Katelyn Boyles wife demonstrated a characteristic one would expect of a Muslim woman living under the Taliban rule which is to say Joshua did all the talking while she kept her mouth shut thankfully she was allowed to ditch her black burka for a stylized Egyptian he jabbed though and how's this nugget for a not so insignificant epilogue to the story Joshua was once briefly married tis an Abe Cotter yes that is an Abe the sister of former terrorist and current multi-millionaire Omar Khadr and during their marriage when's an Abe said that the 9/11 terror attacks were justified Joshua was quick to defend her remarks Wow makes you wonder if Joshua even wanted to be rescued in the first place by the way his brief marriage an Abe is being dismissed by Joshua's apologists as a mere coincidence I say if you believe that whopper then I have a bridge I can sell you real cheap that's located in a certain New York borough bottom line when it comes to this kidnapping caper I smell a rat of godzilla-sized proportions I don't know what the real story is I don't know if anyone knows the real story but it might help things come to light if only the politically correct sheep in the mainstream media at least started asking the right albeit tough questions for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks we have an all new fall lineup please visit the rebel dot media slash shows and check it out you
