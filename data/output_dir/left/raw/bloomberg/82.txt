1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,660
I think the passion, you really need it to
create something on a particular level.

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,280
You need to give everything from yourself
in there and that's the difference I think.

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,080
Bespoke means for me, that I discuss really with the client what he wants.

4
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:37,580
You have ideas here, you can see different
materials, different models.

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,380
It's very important to listen.

6
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,940
Nowadays, many people don't listen anymore.

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,080
The last is really the copy of your foot on
which we create the shoe.

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,880
But nobody shows you how to make a last, really, so you have to train it by yourself,

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,340
and to get the feeling by yourself, how you should do it.

10
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,140
You have certain measurements from the foot, but the feeling of the client is always different.

11
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,140
I love using leather because you get this
particular different touches.

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,060
What I appreciate so much from this tannery is they use a Swiss calf.

13
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,120
Maybe it's because it's cold and these animals live on a very high level in the mountains.

14
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:30,760
It's always a cow, but cows are also different.

15
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,460
I think it's something which you can wear for a long time and the leather

16
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,980
the more you wear it, it really gets more life I think.

17
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,140
I will draw the model from the client.

18
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:52,350
This drawing, I will translate then on a flat
paper model, which I put on the leather, then

19
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,799
we sew it together.

20
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,200
From there, we start creating really the shoe.

21
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:06,619
I think the handcraft and this concentration of different craftmanships in Florence is

22
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,068
really coming up from the Medici family.

23
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:18,110
If it's a jeweler or if it's a painter, or a sculpture maker, they've always tried to

24
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,260
get the best artisans in town.

25
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,520
The upper will be nailed and pulled over the last.

26
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,660
I will start sewing with the linen thread,
which is made waterproofed with wax.

27
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,310
When you stitch you have two threads which go into the same hole and as you pull,

28
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,620
the wax goes hot, it will seal together, so the water can't go through.

29
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,680
This is a very particular and very old process.

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,180
It's very rare to be a woman in this shoemaking world.

31
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,040
When I started, everybody looked at me and said, this lady is going to close down in

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,200
a year.

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,700
A woman in a man's job, it's not going to
work.

34
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,300
Now, they all proud in this area that I'm
still here.

35
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,760
We fill in the wooden shank and back support because that's the part under the curve of

36
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,600
your foot, which will not be bent so it has
to be supportive and stiff.

37
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,760
The front part we will fill with cork.

38
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,090
This is to give you a cushion effect, as you bend it the whole time it's important to have

39
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,220
it soft.

40
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,780
We apply the sole.

41
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,040
We will glue it on and afterwards make a channel.

42
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,420
We will stitch the welt and the leather sole
together through the channel so it gets more

43
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,800
the shape of a shoe and you see it more as a finished product.

44
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,560
When we work normally in the workshop, it's a very calm feeling.

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,570
We are in a meditation, because you are so concentrated on what you do.

46
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:05,840
You can feel that all of a sudden, the energy comes down.

47
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
Everybody's concentrated on his particular step.

48
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,840
The last big step to put on is the heel, which will be built out of single layers of leather.

49
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,380
We will glue them and nail them on, and then cut them in shape.

50
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,420
At the end, we pass some glass, sanding it.

51
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,440
And then burn it with hot irons, so all the pores are going to be completely closed up.

52
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,680
The last step is to shine the whole shoe.

53
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,480
And then we can pull out the last and then
the client can wear it.

54
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,320
If you count the hours, we would work around three weeks on one pair of shoes.

55
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:15,460
When I see a finished shoe and the client
really tries it on, it's always the moment

56
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,420
of reality and relief, if it really fits well.

57
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:26,220
When this person is really happy, you can
just see in their eyes without explaining

58
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,480
that it's the best feeling ever.

59
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,820
I think a shoe is more than an object.

60
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,020
A shoe really reflects the person who is wearing it.

61
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,300
The leather they choose, the color they choose, and how they wear it.

62
00:05:46,680 --> 00:00:00,000
Because it's not just the pair in the beginning, it's the pair over many, many years.
