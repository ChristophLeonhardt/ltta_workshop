00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:07,643
THAT IS FALSE.

3
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:08,377
ANOTHER EMAIL STATING MUELLER IS

4
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:08,978
THE ONLY HOPE FOR TRUTH.

BLUE WAVE INTO A SOON ARMY.

11
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:29,565
CAN REPUBLICANS KEEP CONTROLLING

12
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:29,932
CONGRESS?

I WILL START WITH YOU.

17
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:43,679
DO YOU THINK DEMOCRATS WILL BE

18
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:44,413
ABLE TO TURN THIS BLUE WAVE INTO

19
00:00:44,413 --> 00:00:44,814
A SOON ARMY?

20
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:47,283
>> THEY ARE HAVING AN INTERNAL

21
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:48,017
DEBATE BETWEEN BERNIE SOCIALISTS

22
00:00:48,017 --> 00:00:50,086
WHO WANT THEM TO RUN ON THE

23
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:50,820
ECONOMY AND NORMAL ESTABLISHMENT

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,821
RESIST DEMOCRATS WHO JUST WANT

25
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:57,693
THEM TO RUN AGAINST TRUMP.

26
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:58,394
THE BERNIE SOCIALISTS WANT TO

27
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:01,731
RUN ON THE ECONOMY WHEN UNDER A

28
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:02,398
CAPITALIST PRESIDENT EVERY

29
00:01:02,398 --> 00:01:03,132
DEMOGRAPHIC IS SUCCEEDING RIGHT

30
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:03,999
NOW.

31
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,301
AS FAR AS PRIMARY ELECTIONS

32
00:01:05,301 --> 00:01:08,003
TODAY DEMOCRATS HAVE NO CHOICE

33
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:15,044
WHICH WAY THEY WANT TO GO.

34
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:16,712
AND THE QUESTION IS WILL

35
00:01:16,712 --> 00:01:21,717
REPUBLICANS GET THEIR ACT

36
00:01:21,717 --> 00:01:23,986
TOGETHER.

37
00:01:23,986 --> 00:01:26,021
>> IS THAT THE BIGGER ISSUE?

38
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:26,756
>> SOMETHING IN THE PENNSYLVANIA

39
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:32,728
18TH A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHEN

40
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:33,429
DEMOCRATS WON OVERWHELMINGLY.

41
00:01:33,429 --> 00:01:37,066
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BERNIE

42
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:43,806
SANDERS BUT RUNNING CANDIDATES

43
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:44,540
THAT UNDERSTAND THE DISTRICT AND

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,274
HAVE A TOUGH CONVERSATION WITH

45
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:45,808
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

46
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:46,542
TAKE WEST VIRGINIA FOR EXAMPLE.

47
00:01:46,542 --> 00:01:47,309
A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE WAS A

48
00:01:47,309 --> 00:01:53,649
TEACHER STRIKE WHERE ALL 55

49
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:54,350
COUNTIES DECIDED TO GO OUT ON

50
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,050
STRIKE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT

51
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,584
GETTING PAID ENOUGH.

52
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:56,552
WHO WAS STANDING WITH THEM AND

53
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:58,487
SUPPORTING THEM?

54
00:01:58,487 --> 00:01:58,888
JOE MANCHIN.

55
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:01,023
THEY WILL REMEMBER HIM TODAY AND

56
00:02:01,023 --> 00:02:06,829
IN NOVEMBER.

57
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:07,496
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVING

58
00:02:07,496 --> 00:02:08,229
THESE HONEST CONVERSATIONS WITH

59
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:08,964
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW TO LOWER

60
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:11,434
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, DECREASE THE

61
00:02:11,434 --> 00:02:12,168
COST OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND

62
00:02:12,168 --> 00:02:15,671
HOW TO SOLVE THE OPIOID CRISIS.

63
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,274
JILLIAN: WILL THAT BE ENOUGH FOR

64
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:19,942
THEM TO WIN?

65
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:23,546
>> IT IS UP TO THE REPUBLICANS

66
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:30,419
WHO HAVE TO LEARN FROM RUNNING

67
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:31,153
ON LOCAL ISSUES WAS LAST TUESDAY

68
00:02:31,153 --> 00:02:31,821
IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA, EVERY

69
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:32,555
ELECTION WHERE REPUBLICANS PUT

70
00:02:32,555 --> 00:02:33,255
PEOPLE UP WE WON SO THE BLUE

71
00:02:33,255 --> 00:02:37,860
WAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE HAD A

72
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,527
MINI RED WAVE BECAUSE LOCAL

73
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:43,032
ISSUES, SIMPLE MESSAGING.

74
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:43,999
DONALD TRUMP IS ABLE TO WIN IN

75
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:51,373
2016, HE WAS ABLE TO TARGET

76
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,107
AREAS WITH A UNIQUE MESSAGE FOR

77
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:52,808
THEM IN THE RUSTBELT, TALKING

78
00:02:52,808 --> 00:02:53,476
ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND JOBS.

79
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:54,210
OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES AND

80
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:54,944
SENATE CANDIDATES CAN LEARN FROM

81
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:55,678
THAT AND LOCALIZED ISSUES HAVE

82
00:02:55,678 --> 00:02:56,378
SIMPLE MESSAGING AND GO AWAY

83
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,915
FROM THE TYPICAL GOP TALKING

84
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:00,449
POINTS THEY CAN WIN.

85
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:01,150
A STATE REP IN OHIO IS A GOOD

86
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,351
EXAMPLE, SHE IS A MILLENNIAL

87
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:06,555
YOUNGER THAN 30, RUNNING ON

88
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:07,990
LOCAL ISSUES AND PRO-TRUMP AND

89
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:11,393
ABLE TO PULL OFF AN UPSET TODAY,

90
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:15,998
CANDIDATES CAN WIN BUT IT IS

91
00:03:15,998 --> 00:03:16,732
GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING BEYOND

92
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:18,868
RUNNING IS A GENERIC REPUBLICAN

93
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:22,037
IN THE LAST DECADE.

94
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:22,872
DEMOCRATS IF YOU CONSIDER HOW

95
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:28,143
HILLARY CLINTON RAN AGAINST

96
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:28,844
DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 BECAUSE

97
00:03:28,844 --> 00:03:29,778
LOOK AT THE FACTS SO MUCH OF HER

98
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:32,748
MESSAGE WAS ANTI-TRUMP, DO YOU

99
00:03:32,748 --> 00:03:37,386
THINK THAT IS GOING TO WORK THIS

100
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:37,686
TIME?

101
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:38,287
>> IT IS DIFFERENT FROM

102
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:39,655
CONGRESSIONAL OR SENATE RACE.

103
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:43,325
WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME AND WHAT

104
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:45,828
HAVE YOU DONE LATELY, DEMOCRATIC

105
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:47,997
CANDIDATES WILL ANSWER THAT

106
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,865
QUESTION AND REPUBLICANS

107
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:50,599
DELIVERED A TAX BILL THAT IS NOT

108
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,036
WORKING FOR A LOT OF

109
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:54,770
MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES AND UNION

110
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,308
SUPPORT HAS GONE DOWN

111
00:03:59,308 --> 00:03:59,742
TREMENDOUSLY.

112
00:03:59,742 --> 00:04:03,979
THE PRES. ISN'T TALKING ABOUT

113
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:04,613
HIS TAX-CUT PLAN BUT THE

114
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:05,347
ECONOMY, DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE A

115
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:10,319
QUESTION OF WHAT IS LEFT ON THE

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,987
TABLE.

117
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:13,022
THEY PROMISED IT INFRASTRUCTURE

118
00:04:13,022 --> 00:04:14,857
PACKAGE AND LOWERING

119
00:04:14,857 --> 00:04:15,991
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE

120
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:19,128
OPIOID CRISIS.

121
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:19,762
WE ARE STILL WAITING AND

122
00:04:19,762 --> 00:04:20,396
DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE THAT

123
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:23,065
CONVERSATION WITH VOTERS AND

124
00:04:23,065 --> 00:04:32,007
LOCAL DISTRICTS IN STATES ACROSS

125
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:32,408
THE COUNTRY.

126
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:33,142
>> THE OPIOID BILL DROPPING IN

127
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:33,876
JUNE, INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD BE

128
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:38,480
MOVING FORWARD AND TAX CUTS ARE

129
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,181
BENEFITING THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS

130
00:04:39,181 --> 00:04:39,782
YOU MENTIONED IN EVERY

131
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:40,516
LOW-INCOME, MIDDLE INCOME GROUP

132
00:04:40,516 --> 00:04:46,155
ESPECIALLY IN THE RUSTBELT AND

133
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:46,822
PENNSYLVANIA, ESPECIALLY IN

134
00:04:46,822 --> 00:04:47,556
PLACES WHERE REPUBLICANS NEED TO

135
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:48,223
WIN SO RUNNING AGAINST THE

136
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:48,757
TEXTILE, GOOD LUCK.

137
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:50,259
>> SOUND GOOD BUT THE TRUTH IS

138
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,994
IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE

139
00:04:51,994 --> 00:04:55,764
IN OHIO AND KENTUCKY AND INDIANA

140
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:56,465
THEY WILL SAY THE MAJORITY OF

141
00:04:56,465 --> 00:00:00,000
THE BENEFIT GOES TO CORPORATIONS
