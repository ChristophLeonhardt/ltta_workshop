1
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,594
- How much does it cost to feed
a family of three per month?

2
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,361
(men answer)

3
00:00:08,361 --> 00:00:12,222
Remember this the home of three,
apartment for three people.

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:15,047
Certain things just need a
little TLC, am I correct?

5
00:00:15,047 --> 00:00:16,047
- [Man] Yep.

6
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:18,087
- [Sheldon] That's generally what happens

7
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:19,809
when you become a father.

8
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:20,855
Everything changes.

9
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:21,736
- [Man] You grow up...

10
00:00:21,736 --> 00:00:23,082
- Everything changes, right?

11
00:00:23,082 --> 00:00:24,655
- [Man] You can't do bad stuff no more.

12
00:00:24,655 --> 00:00:27,122
- Absolutely, because
you want to stick around

13
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:29,678
for your legacy, which is your child.

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:32,261
(cars honking)

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,635
This is the South Side of Chicago.

16
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:37,051
When people think about Chicago,

17
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:40,217
the first thing they speak
about is the violence, right?

18
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,818
Oftentimes you really
don't hear those stories

19
00:00:41,818 --> 00:00:43,482
about some of the great
things that are going on

20
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:45,696
on the South Side.

21
00:00:45,696 --> 00:00:47,945
Courage, integrity.

22
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,537
I learned that from my
mother, my grandmother,

23
00:00:51,537 --> 00:00:54,418
but I still was a knucklehead,
running with the wrong crowd.

24
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:57,634
I wound up going to
jail for armed robbery.

25
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:59,677
I disappointed a lot of
people who believed in me

26
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:01,973
and who had invested in me.

27
00:01:01,973 --> 00:01:04,806
(inspiring music)

28
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:10,955
Really understanding the
consequences behind what I did,

29
00:01:10,955 --> 00:01:11,894
it changed me.

30
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:15,922
It made me look at the world differently.

31
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:18,083
Working hard, right?

32
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,746
Give me three things that you
need to change in your life

33
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:23,496
and just be honest with yourself.

34
00:01:24,748 --> 00:01:27,850
I built the Dovetail Project,
a fatherhood initiative

35
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,603
for young African-American men
between the ages of 17 to 24.

36
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:34,580
I grew up with my father
in and out of my life.

37
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,338
That played a real big
impact on me in my growth.

38
00:01:38,338 --> 00:01:39,853
Before you can talk about fatherhood,

39
00:01:39,853 --> 00:01:41,906
you have to talk about manhood

40
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:44,498
and how you view yourself
and value yourself

41
00:01:44,498 --> 00:01:46,234
because the way that you view yourself,

42
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:48,937
that's how your children view you.

43
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:51,484
90% of the young men that
we serve have grown up

44
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:53,491
with their fathers in
and out of their lives,

45
00:01:53,491 --> 00:01:57,720
but they're looking to
do something different.

46
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,858
We've been able to impact
over 287 young men,

47
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:02,968
giving them scholarships to go to school,

48
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:07,204
partnering them with employers,
talking about those areas.

49
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:10,244
We have 287 success stories, right?

50
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:11,649
Because all of them have come out

51
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:16,603
to just be that great father
and heroes to their children.

52
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,710
When I became a father for the first time,

53
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,569
to me it was really a magical moment.

54
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:22,495
I had a chance to see life.

55
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,179
I'll never forget it.

56
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,218
I don't think we live in a bad world.

57
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:29,168
There are a lot of great
people doing wonderful things.

58
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:33,622
My goal is to make sure that
she's one of those people.

59
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:37,267
Stories like that aren't
told all the time.

60
00:02:37,267 --> 00:00:00,000
