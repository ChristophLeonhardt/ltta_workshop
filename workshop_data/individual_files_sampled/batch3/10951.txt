France they go marching on to the World Cup final so their Jersey meridia what did you think of that much well I think as I was telling you at at the halftime that happened what we could expect one goal would win it and one goal would create some reaction and that happened more space for France to counter-attack more initiative from from Belgium but I think the Belgium players they go home with a bad feeling feeling that we could do more and better feeling that probably others is out of it because it tried absolutely everything but many of other players they kept hiding and a little bit more in the last 20 25 minutes but they are much better than that and for big occasions big players and many of the players they were not there in the big occasion France was was good on the basic things of the game they defended well they were compact they score a goal that probably is Fellaini the last match the last man to to touch it but they score and then they try to control the game which basically they they did with fantastic performance by varam and I think a very good performance by Papa Pablo was was mature he played the game with with great maturity when he had to hold position and to keep control of the game he did when the Shah took off Jihu to bring his own Z then paga had more freedom but had freedom not to do silly things he had freedom to keep the ball away from the dangerous areas to keep to keep the ball to assist Griezmann for a great chance he was very very mature but in the end I think the result was one Neil could be zero zero could be one one and be now waiting for for extra time but since the beginning I was I was smelling this I was smelling a match without many walls and the game that was was was good by the emotion that involves the semi-final but what was not especially good football match the pitches for the goal now I mean it's another goal from a set-piece of this World Cup as well you know set pieces are something that you can train weed out without damage more of your physical condition and when you are in a competition like this where the accumulation of fatigue comes you have just to recover then it's very difficult to have training sessions of development of tactical situations that create even more spending of energy opening the door for more small injuries so what can you train set please you don't run you don't spend any of your energetic sources you do it you do it in a relaxed way you do it you do it as part of your recovering sessions and you go for the set pieces and you develop the set pieces and you become really dangerous on that and you know that that can can be in this case happen in a space between I think Witzel and felony until he attacks the ball very well in the space but the most important thing is the quality of the service and their service was was was fast was exacting on that spot then indeed he comes and between new entity and and fellaini they give no chance to talk or song you know so you said talking about energy as well I mean killing him back again showed it had some tricks and flicks as well he proved that he is a prodigy he's something for the future for France as well yes this French team is young you know Varane looks looks a play with 20 years of football but varam must be below 25 he played his first match with me with 18 in real madrid that was 2013 so he must be now 24 years old or so and then Griezmann is young Paul is young pava look as a man and a zoom TT Matt VD I think only Lori's see who they are Matt VD they are on on the thirties is a very very young team and of course two years ago Euro Cup final World Cup final now and the majority of these players they have one more euro to play or two they have won more World Cup to play or to well Maurice I mean she said he might be in history she did produce some fine saves as well yeah but for me the best one is is Corsa Anto Lisa of course is in the moment of the game where everything is almost decided that give only a corner where Paul could keep the ball and hide the ball from the Belgium players in the last 30 seconds of the game but that is the safe and for a man of two meters to go to go to that ball with his left hand these are fantastic is a fantastic City so so France car marching on that the face either Croatia or England I mean how do you see you said before that Croatia were tired how do you see the second semi-final you know I think England is fashion has younger players had a easy group phase where they play two easy matches and the match against Belgium that every player so the players that are playing now they they all had one match less than Croatia to play because they didn't play against Belgium and the majority of the players are our young feed players when I look to the team I think Ashley yang 33 years old just today or yesterday something like that and a part of that the players are all very young and and and very feet and the way England plays with three center centre backs probably three PA is Ashley yang are the players that have to to run more I see Croatia probably as the globality the best midfield players in in in the competition if Paul plays always like he did today in the second half then Paul Matt we D is and and can't a is a fantastic group of players a moderate racket each abrazo vich is his is the same level so let's see what let's see what happened between England and Croatia I think Croatia has great mentality a fantastic media player to control the game in the possession of the game but England is is a happy team is a team that you look at them and you see happiness is a team that that they went from Eden candidate to a candidate and I just hope because that's that's what they really need I just hope that they are themselves and not like Belgium that the majority of the players they were not themselves in big matches you have to be yourself or a bit but the big match can make you a bit that extra adrenaline that extra feeling of how big I am can only make you better if the big occasion makes you worse than you are then you regret and I think the majority of the Belgium players are having now this feeling and I hope that this is not the feeling of the English players looking to my boys I think lingard is one that enjoyed the occasion I think the guard is going to be lingered I think he's going to be the happy kid that is every day and that is showing in every match I think he's going to show this yet the same Ashla yang is very reliable I think he will not be affected by by the occasion and normally Markos Rushford and and Phil Jones will not play but looking to the to the England players I really believe that that will be their father for the occasion and of course Modric is one of my of my boys when I bought him to Real Madrid they the Spanish press was saying that we bought the worst player of Real Madrid history is not at all the worst player of Real Madrid history but I have four of my boys in in in the English team and that's my second country so hopefully England does it you
