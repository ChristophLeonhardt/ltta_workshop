1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,935
KOREA NEGOTIATIONS HARD LAST

2
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:03,636
NIGHT IN NASHVILLE.

3
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:05,971
WE HEARD A LOT FROM HIM ON THIS.

4
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,840
>> YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT HAS

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,542
BEEN MAKING THE POINT ABOUT

6
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:10,709
NORTH KOREA AND BRINGING THEM

7
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:12,578
TO THE TABLE AND MAKING SURE

8
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:14,380
THAT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH KIM

9
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,882
JONG-UN SEEMS TO BE ON A GOOD

10
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:17,216
FOOTING.

11
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:18,384
WHICH IT APPEARS TO BE RIGHT

12
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:18,851
NOW.

13
00:00:18,851 --> 00:00:20,719
THE WHITE HOUSE NOT SAYING THAT

14
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,588
THE SUMMIT IS BACK ON JUST YET.

15
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:24,023
I IMAGINE THAT A LOT OF THAT

16
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,624
WILL RIDE ON THE OUTCOME OF

17
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:27,526

THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY

23
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,769
SOUNDING A NOTE OF OPTIMISM

24
00:00:36,769 --> 00:00:38,304
ABOUT THE IDEA IT COULD STILL

25
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,039

36
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:57,356
TAKES PLACE AT A LATER DATE AND

37
00:00:57,356 --> 00:00:58,991
BE PREPARED FOR THAT AS WELL.

38
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,659
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS TWO TEAMS

39
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,728

WITH NORTH KOREA ON WHAT THE

46
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:16,909
SUMMIT CAN ACHIEVE.

47
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,947
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE A LOT IS

48
00:01:21,947 --> 00:01:22,448
PREARRANGED.

49
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:24,083

HAD PRAISE FOR JOHN BOLTON WHO

52
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,460
GOT NORTH KOREA ALL WORKED UP

53
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,394
WHEN HE SAID DENUCLEARIZATION

54
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:37,763
OF NORTH KOREA WOULD LIKELY

55
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:39,264
FOLLOW THE LIBYAN MODEL.

56
00:01:39,264 --> 00:01:42,067
>> President Trump: WHERE IS

57
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:42,935
JOHN BOLTON?

58
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:47,172
THE GREAT JOHN BOLTON.

59
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:48,574
THEY THINK HE IS SO NASTY AND

60
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:51,143
TOUGH THAT I HAVE TO HOLD HIM

61
00:01:51,143 --> 00:01:51,844

00:01:52,544 --> 00:01:55,614
HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB.

64
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:56,782
YOU BETTER GET SOME REST.

67
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:02,154
>> YOU BETTER GET REST.

68
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:05,224
I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT BOLTON

69
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:07,426
GETS UP EVERY DAY AT LEAST 4:30

70
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,193

71
00:02:09,193 --> 00:02:10,362
THE PRESIDENT HAS WALKED BACK

72
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:13,666
THE IDEA OF THE LIBYAN MODEL

73
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,067
FOR NORTH KOREAN

74
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:15,801
DENUCLEARIZATION SAYING THAT

75
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:17,670
GADHAFI NEVER GOT ANY SECURITY

76
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,837
OR POLITICAL GUARANTEES FROM

77
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:19,772

PERSONAL, POLITICAL AND

81
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:28,681
SECURITY GUARANTEES IF HE GOES

82
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,915
AHEAD WITH DENUCLEARIZATION.

83
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:30,849
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON WHERE ALL

84
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:31,483

85
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:33,852

WHAT DID WE HEAR ON THAT?

91
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:41,727

ACCOMPLISH OVER THE LAST 16

95
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:49,168
MONTHS WILL BE AT RISK IF THE
