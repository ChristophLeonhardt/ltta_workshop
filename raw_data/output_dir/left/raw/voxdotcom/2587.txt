1
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,920
Gene Lu uses GPS to map his runs on a phone.

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,900
These days, that’s pretty normal.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,630
But the way he does it, isn’t like most
people.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,780
Gene is drawing something here.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:24,710
Before he runs, Gene spends hours mapping
a route to create an elaborate drawing.

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,860
He then traces it on the ground using GPS
during the run.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,460
Sometimes I try to remember not the next turn,
but maybe two or three turns ahead.

8
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,680
Sort of, like, a way to distract myself on the run.

9
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:41,180
Turning your run into a doodle isn’t an
easy way to train.

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,080
But something else he’s doing is.

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,600
Using GPS can make you into a better runner, no
matter what route follow.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,759
In the 1970s, the US military created the
Global Positioning System, or GPS, by launching

13
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:09,880
a network of satellites into orbit.

14
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,409
Transmitting precise, jam-resistant radio navigational
signals.

15
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,869
A GPS receiver measures its distance from
multiple satellites in order to pinpoint where

16
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,280
you are on Earth.

17
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,719
By the year 2000, the government made the
system fully available for public use and

18
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,020
around that time the first GPS watches were
released for consumers.

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,000
Clunky design and high prices meant only hardcore
data nerds were using them for exercise.

20
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,490
But over time, devices became cheaper and
sleeker and eventually, mobile apps made GPS

21
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,960
tracking widely accessible.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,360
These days, it’s commonly used by casual
runners.

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,600
I’ve become very accustomed to running with
technology on me...

24
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,760
When I go running without my stuff, I sort
of feel like...

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,300
Almost like drowning a little bit.

26
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,829
Performance in running is measured by just
a few variables: distance, time, and speed.

27
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:05,680
GPS makes it easy to monitor those elements.

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,840
In 2016, Runner’s World conducted a survey
of their global audience and found that 80%

29
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,520
of runners used GPS to track their runs.

30
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,520
I go for a run, I track my run, and I am given
that data about that run.

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,240
So based on that, I can now do it again and
either up my distance,

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,220
lower it, so on so forth.

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,080
Using GPS to collect data about your runs
makes it easy to track your accomplishments.

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,460
But there's another reason GPS tracking is
gaining popularity.

35
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,480
Putting your run on a map with a time and
pace, gives runners a better story -- to tell

36
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,520
on social media.

37
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,380
What’s missing from it is, I think, the narrative to that
run.

38
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,890
Like, what was that run about?

39
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,820
Where did you run?

40
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,200
Was it hard?

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,140
Was it easy?

42
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,590
I think social media has sort of changed how
people approach running.

43
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,960
For me one of the big factors or one of the big motivations

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,440
for running these shapes is to be able to

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,080
share it.

46
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,380
To a lot of people, this looks like bragging.

47
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,630
I’m going to share it to social media, I’m
going to get all these likes and then I’m

48
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,780
going to do more.

49
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,280
But, it turns out, sharing your runs on social
media actually makes you a better runner.

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,840
This visualization comes from researchers
at MIT that analyzed GPS data from millions

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,460
of runners and correlated it to social network
sharing.

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,400
They found that when runners share their accomplishments,

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,140
they run farther, faster and longer.

54
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,780
And so do their friends.

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,780
According to their research, “an additional
kilometer run by friends can inspire someone

56
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,540
to run an additional three-tenths of a kilometer
and an additional ten minutes.”

57
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,970
Gene isn’t your average example, but sharing
his runs has made him a better runner.

58
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,380
With social media being at the forefront of
everything, there’s this social media feedback

59
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,080
loop that sort of merges with the sport of
running.

60
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,650
Everytime I did the run I would post it onto
social media and my friends would just sort of

61
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,590
freak out and say, “Whoa!

62
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,440
I didn’t know that there was the Dire Wolf
in Queens!”

63
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,640
And so because of that, I started to do more
and more.

64
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,739
Did the lion in Minneapolis.

65
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,580
The octopus.

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,400
The bear in Jackson Heights.

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,220
C3PO.

68
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,140
Darth Vader.

69
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,880
Storm Trooper.

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,600
TIE Fighter.

71
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,100
AT-AT Walker.

72
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,260
AT-ST Walker.

73
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,430
At some point, it started to go into ten-plus
miles.

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:39,000
And for me that was sort of an achievement
because at the time I was only doing five miles.

75
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,380
There is, however, a downside.

76
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,620
Using GPS to track our runs has raised privacy
concerns.

77
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,289
When the popular fitness tracking app Strava
released their global heatmap showing data collected

78
00:04:52,289 --> 00:04:57,169
from runners around the world, they unknowingly
revealed detailed military information

79
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,840
from locations where users had been tracking
their jogging routes.

80
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,580
While you might not be stationed on a secret
military base, sharing information about your

81
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,580
run can make your daily routine and home address
publicly available.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,499
But it’s a tradeoff.

83
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:17,660
The same technology that's driving people
to share their progress and location, at the

84
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,640
cost of their privacy, it's also helping them
stay active.

85
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,330
At least we are getting more people to run.

86
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,500
We’re getting more people to run because
of GPS and, on top of that, social media.

87
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:35,440
I think with all this tracking,

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:00:00,000
I think you just need to be able to turn it on and off.
