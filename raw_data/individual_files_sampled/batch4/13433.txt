all righty so here we are on the bench Shapiro show Facebook live and I wanted to take this opportunity to really introduce you to Andrew Clavin so you've heard me say his name on my show every day for two years but you may never have actually heard from Andrew Clavin directly if you haven't you need to go and check out his show so Andrew thanks for joining me I appreciate it it's always a pleasure to see you as far away as you are I know it's amazing we're literally next door do we go there yet we're in different Studios which is just the way that we like it exactly so drew I you know I want to give you a chance to make the picture for your show so what do you think is it that makes your show different than my show or knows it Knowles is execrable show well I think the thing about that makes it different than Knowles is just literate and intelligent witty you know but that wholly brings me you know in into your ballpark you know one of the big things is I lived my entire life basically as a novelist and the the traits that novelists have the the super power that they have is basically observing an entire field of information it's not so much I don't it's not sitting around talking about this policy is gonna do this this tax cut is gonna go here or there it's more talking about the culture and where things stand in a kind of big picture way which is incredibly important because that's the thing that so much of the media is trying to manipulate the media is always trying to manipulate your imaginative world and put it out of joint with the real world and what I'm trying to do is get your imaginative world back into running with the real world so what you're seeing and what you're thinking are both the same thing except this weekend if you were paying attention this weekend it was one crisis after another that simply wasn't happening you know our children are being murdered in their schools everywhere that's not happening you know Trump is going insane he's no warrants after what he's pretty much exactly as he was before the Russians have taken over our elections it's just not happening and so we have a culture basically run by the left-wing is trying to manipulate the the people's imagination to see the world from the left-wing perspective and all I'm trying to do is get them to see the world as it actually is and one of the things folks if you haven't listened to Drew's show that that really is is I think his specialty is because he's a constructor of narrative professionally he's also a Deconstructor of narrative professionally that's essentially what a show is is taking these narratives and breaking them down and showing how they're false one of the narratives that we've been getting from Hollywood consistently is of course America is an awful terrible sexist racist bigoted place the number one movie at the box office demonstrated just how racist we are over the weekend Black Panther made a bajillion dollars when every white person in America went to see it and then took a picture of themself in front of the poster in order to demonstrate their bonafide ease so what do you make of the fact that Black Panther did so well at the box office and also I don't know if you've seen the film but if he had any thoughts on it well I'm the only person I know who hasn't seen it so I think I may be the race last racist in America because I just didn't I don't like superhero movies that much and I really think that they are kind of infantilizing I mean there are exceptions are great superhero movies like Logan was a terrific one some of the old The Dark Knight films I really liked but you know the problem with superhero films is that they're basically about heroics without tragedy if you have a character like Superman you have all these basic superheroes you know that they're not risking that much when they go and take on the gigantic monster plus the gigantic monster has no real personality he's not a Muslim he doesn't has not George Soros he does never full-out utopian philosophy they never have to engage with the world as it is you can say yes we've had childlike genres before maybe the Western but you have to remember the 10 or 15 great westerns rise out of a genre of just absolute trash which the Western the Western was as for Hollywood lecturing us about anything it is it is amazing to me I mean this you know I've been complaining for years that the right doesn't get involved enough in culture and the other side of that is of course the left blacklist sauce it keeps us out of culture I mean if you've ever said a right-wing thing a Hollywood meeting you know the next place you are is in the parking lot but the flipside of that is this culture is completely the left's creation so they're the ones who have torn down the barriers between the sexes they are the ones who say there are no rules to sexuality it's just do whatever you want to do they're the ones who told women they didn't have to be modest they could treat sex the same way as men they're the ones who told men they didn't have to be protective or strong they could be weak they could actually turn themselves into women and then they're the ones who complain when the culture throws up the stuff that it's going to throw up when you remove barriers they're the ones who say hey how come women are being abused all over the place you created a culture in which that's gonna happen how come people are shooting each other all the time well you're the ones who said that we didn't have to worry about gangster rap we didn't have to worry about people screaming violent vile things over our radios they created this culture and they're the ones who now are wagging their fingers and lecturing us about it which at least is good for comic relief well for a lot of folks who listen to my show and have not listened to Drew's show there are a lot of people who do us in to both of our shows what we usually get is that they take - down or and they take yours as an upper and that's because Drew's show is a lot more optimistic in in tone and tenor than mine his actual theme song contains the line life is tickety-boo which is actually become a t-shirt I believe at this point so drew what makes you so optimistic about the state of American life at this point when apparently all is in the toilet we're all going to die and and nuclear Hellfire will rain down on all of us from from North Korea well you know actually I think things are going fantastically well you know I think that I think that we're going forward in scientific ways that are insane you know hunger is virtually been eliminated disease has been cut back so things are actually going well but I think the real difference between you and me is I think you're more of an idealist than I am I as a novelist I've always been kind of a tragedy and I've always looked at the world as a sad place where things ultimately go wrong all people die all cultures fall all con that just means that every day that I'm still here it's a celebration I once told you that you wake up every day angry that it's not 1956 and I wake up every day thankful that it's not 1936 I'm expecting I always expect a certain amount of the worst because of what I the way I'd look at human beings and the way I look at history but that means that this is a great day and conservatives are like doctors in the end we know we lose you know every doctor knows he's gonna lose his patient but every day that we win is a good day and you only have to win this day and night right now I think we're winning like crazy as our own president might say yeah in my own defense 1956 without the segregation and with women in the workplace to make that correction before the left jump son takes it out of context and construct an entire narrative out of whole cloth well that's the Andrew Clavin show and you should give that a listen you should head over right now while
