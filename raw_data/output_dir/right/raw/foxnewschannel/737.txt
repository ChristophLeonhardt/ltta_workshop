1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:03,862
FEES AMOUNT OF HIS WORD, HE WILL

2
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:12,103
LET'S GET REACTION OUT FROM

3
00:00:12,104 --> 00:00:12,804
FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL MIKE

4
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:15,273
McKAY ZANE.

5
00:00:15,274 --> 00:00:16,808
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,643
YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:20,812
CONGRESSMAN, THIS IS WILD.

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:21,679
THE JUSTICE THAT YOU HAVE

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,615
RECEIVED ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT

10
00:00:23,616 --> 00:00:24,382
YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY ENTITLED TO.

11
00:00:24,383 --> 00:00:27,118
WHERE ARE WE TENANT, JUDGE?

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,620
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN THE SUBPOENA

13
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,428
WE WOULD HAVE TO DO MORE

14
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,664
DISCUSSING BETWEEN AND AMONGST

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,268
>> Laura: IT LOOKS LIKE THE

16
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:44,335
DOCUMENTS NUNEZ REQUESTED WERE

17
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,404
ABOUT INFORMANTS PLACED INSIDE

18
00:00:46,405 --> 00:00:47,939
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, OR WHO

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,610
APPROACH THE DRUM CAMPAIGN.

20
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:56,881
INVESTIGATION REALLY BEGAN.

21
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,620
INDICATIONS ARE THAT IT BEGAN

22
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:10,695
WELL INVOLVED, CHRISTOPHER

23
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,798
STEELE                    CHRISO

24
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:13,831
STEELE                    CHRISH

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,837
ABOUT.

26
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:22,674
AND WHO WAS THE IMPETUS JUDGE

27
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:23,808
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

28
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:25,310
>> THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW

29
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:31,916
INTERESTED IN EXAMPLE, KNOWING

30
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:33,618
HOW THIS INFORMANT, WHO STARTED

31
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:41,826
REALLY PLAY WITH EACH OTHER'S

32
00:01:41,827 --> 00:01:46,798
TOYS AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

33
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,735
THAT HAPPENED, WHO BROUGHT IT

34
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,479
THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO KNOW THAT

35
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,413
AS WELL.

36
00:02:05,851 --> 00:02:06,584
FAILURE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL

37
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,853
TO REVEAL WHO THESE STAFF

38
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:10,121
ATTORNEYS ARE.

39
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,991
AND IT LOOKS LIKE ESTHER

40
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:13,858
KLEINSMITH WAS WRITING

41
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:14,659
UNBELIEVABLE TEXT MESSAGES THAT

42
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,996
HE WAS SO DEPRESSED AFTER THE

43
00:02:17,997 --> 00:02:21,466
ELECTION, HE WAS STRESSED AND

44
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,401
DEPRESSED.

45
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:24,435
AND AT THE HEART OF THIS

46
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:30,208
INVESTIGATION ALONG WITH STRZOK

47
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:39,617
AT LEAST TO ME, IS NOT JUST THE

48
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,220
STATEMENTS ABOUT THE RESISTANCE

49
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:44,522
BUT RATHER, A SET OF MESSAGES

50
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:48,860
THAT PASS BETWEEN STRZOK AND HIS

51
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:51,462
FRIEND THE NIGHT THAT

52
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:52,797
DONALD TRUMP OUT THE NOMINATION,

53
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:56,434
WHERE SHE WROTE TO HIM THAT IT'S

54
00:02:56,435 --> 00:02:58,403
UNBELIEVABLE TRUNK OUT OF

55
00:02:58,404 --> 00:03:01,839
NOMINATION.

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,242
AND HE HE SAID THIS INCREASES

57
00:03:04,243 --> 00:03:05,610
THE PRESSURE TO TERMINATE AND

58
00:03:05,611 --> 00:03:07,645
WHY E, WHICH WAS THE CODE NAME,

59
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:11,849
MADE YOUR EXAM, FOR THE CLINTON

60
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,417
INVESTIGATION.

61
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:14,252
THAT'S NOT JUST AN EXPRESSION OF

62
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:14,986
OPINION, THAT'S A STATEMENT OF

63
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:22,460
IN THE IG REPORT, I DON'T RECALL

64
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:23,261
SEEING THAT.

65
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:24,696
AND I THINK THAT SOMETHING THEY

66
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:27,498
HAVE TO QUESTION STRZOK ABOUT

67
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,633
WHEN HE TESTIFIES.

68
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:31,502
>> Laura: AND JUDGE, HE WAS

69
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:40,812
JUST WALKED OUT OF THE DOJ LAST

70
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:41,112
WEEK.

71
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:42,613
APPARENTLY JUST LOST HIS

72
00:03:42,614 --> 00:03:43,815
SECURITY CLEARANCE.

73
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:45,416
I NEVER WORKED AT DOJ.

74
00:03:45,417 --> 00:03:47,585
I'VE WORKED AT THE WHITE HOUSE

75
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:50,755
AND TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION,

76
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:51,189
SUPREME COURT.

77
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,323
I'VE NEVER WORKED AT DOJ BUT IF

78
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:54,125
THAT'S THE WAY BUSINESS IS DONE

79
00:03:54,126 --> 00:03:55,660
AT THE DOJ, WE ARE IN BIG

80
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:58,229
TROUBLE IN THIS COUNTRY.

81
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,198
BIG TROUBLE.

82
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,233
>> DOESN'T INSPIRE CONFIDENCE,

83
00:04:02,234 --> 00:04:04,235
NOR DOES SOMETHING THAT WAS

84
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:07,438
REPORTED IN THE IG REPORT,

85
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,441
NAMELY THAT THEY WERE FBI AGENTS

86
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:12,744
IN ADDITION TO THE PRESS GETTING

87
00:04:12,745 --> 00:04:14,245
THREE MEALS AND FREE TICKETS AND

88
00:04:14,246 --> 00:04:16,347
OTHER PERKS, AND THAT THERE WERE

89
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:17,849
SO MANY OF THEM.

90
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:23,921
THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTE JAW

91
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:24,655
DROPPER.

92
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:27,325
THE NOTION THAT FBI AGENTS WERE

93
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:29,293
GETTING COMPENSATION COME

94
00:04:29,294 --> 00:00:00,000
ESSENTIALLY COME FROM REPORTERS
