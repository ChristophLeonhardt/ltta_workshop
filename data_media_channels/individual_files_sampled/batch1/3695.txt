the year is 1947 McCarthyism is about to sweep the nation Congress holds its first televised session and in the South Jim Crow is alive and well but on April 15th Jackie Robinson will break the baseball color barrier playing in his first game for the Brooklyn Dodgers more and more black athletes continue to join the league and by 1959 they account for 17% of MLB rosters and provide the game with some of his biggest superstars including Hank Aaron Ernie Banks and Willie Mays by the mid-70s african-americans make up almost 1/3 of the league's players out laying the country's black population by a ratio of 5 to 2 but over the last 40 years Major League Baseball has seen a steady decline of black athletes hitting a low of 8.1 percent in 2012 and so the question remains why there are a couple of explanations that may seem obvious for one the league has seen a steep increase in Latino players over the last couple of decades African Americans have also slowly migrated to other sports but many would argue that the large drop in black baseball players has a lot to do with money in the United States pay-for-play youth baseball has become the new normal while there are community and public high school leagues available to most they don't offer the same amount of exposure that Premier League's do and if a player is offered the chance to play college ball he's going to have to pay for it under NCAA regulation d1 football teams can give out 85 full scholarships for a 90 to 105 man roster basketball can give out 13 for a roster of about 15 for baseball's 35 man roster a school is allowed to give out no more than eleven point seven full scholarships which are often divided among players in a sports so dependent on wealth it becomes tough for many black athletes to compete considering the average household income of a black family there's only sixty percent that of a white family it's true that the total number of african-american pro athletes has only been increasing since the mid 1970s so maybe the fact that less are playing baseball is it really a problem but the idea that the sports you can play are so dependent on your wealth and the wealth you possess is so closely related to your race doesn't exactly support the American ideal of equal opportunity for all it may be that the sports we watch and the people who participate in them tell us more about our society than we'd like to admit the main studio and our nxq do this is so with the talent can be more part of the show and you can read the graphics better and you can see the the the contrast and and again let them tell the better
