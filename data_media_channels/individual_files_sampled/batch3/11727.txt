a court ruling in Germany has provoked controversy after it refused the deportation of a Turkish jihadist the decisions likely to also give Chancellor Merkel a headache as she continues to struggle to form a coalition government RT solid dibinsky has more details well Germany's a top court has ruled on Wednesday that a person cannot be deported back to their country of origin if they face torture or inhumane treatment in that country now the Turkish Court has said that the Germany would need to have appropriate assurances that neither of those would take place if a person was deported to that country now this case has been highlighted because of a court case brought by a German born Turk who was convicted back in 2015 of supporting terrorism the man whose thirty years old had travelled to Syria and had supported a terrorist organization in the country including giving funds to that terrorist organization now he received a three-and-a-half year sentence for doing so here in Germany but in 2016 he was threatened with deportation back to Turkey and he decided to appeal that threat and take it to the court system here in this country now he had a support from groups such as Amnesty who said that if he was deported to Turkey because he had links to a terror organization he could be tortured or abused and they're not the only human rights organization who have made links and Alette allegations like this Human Rights report back in just a few months ago actually raised a report which detailed 11 cases of people who had links to terror organizations who were tortured they say all were abducted while in police custody and as a result of that the court has made this decision today the man has two-thirds of his sentence left to serve and could be released within the next year and that is highly controversial here in Germany because many people fear that he could potentially be a a terror threat in the future he could actually be somebody who then goes on to actually radicalize other people to carry out potential terror attacks here in Germany and Germany of course is no stranger to terror attacks the country's been on high alert since the Christmas market attack in December 2016 which killed 12 people and injured dozens others were back in 2017 just weeks after that Christmas market attack the German interior minister called for speed up in deportations in cases like this but this ruling could poke in the wheel of those with anybody now able to claim that if they deported back to their country of origin they could face inhumane treatment or torture and that some people say could add fuel to the fire to an already politically charged argument this thing is a fuel on the fire of anyone and it's not only the IFD but it's those in the Christian social Union and also electrician Democrats who want to have criminals deported as a new ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court will not be received with great pleasure by the public at large well this case comes as a highly sensitive time politically here in Germany as Angela Merkel is trying to grasp onto her chancellorship her party is in talks with the SPD over forming a coalition government and that comes after talks with other parties in Germany fell apart now this decision by the High Court is unlikely to help the parties or who already have very deep divisions when it comes to issues over immigration gel together
