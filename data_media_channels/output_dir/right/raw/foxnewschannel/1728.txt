1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:01,617
KOREA HAVE NOT HAPPENED

2
00:00:01,617 --> 00:00:03,552
LEADING UP TO THE SUMMIT.

3
00:00:03,552 --> 00:00:03,919
NEIL?

4
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,587
>> Neil: SOMETHING HAPPENED.

5
00:00:04,587 --> 00:00:05,354
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS

6
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:05,654
BUDDY.

7
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:06,622
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:00:06,622 --> 00:00:07,256
RICH EDSON AT THE STATE

9
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:07,656
DEPARTMENT.

10
00:00:07,656 --> 00:00:09,225
COULD IT BE AS SIMPLE AS A

11
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,293
CASE OF COLD FEET AND NORTH

12
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:12,161
KOREANS GETTING NERVOUS

13
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:13,562
ABOUT GIVING AWAY SO MUCH SO

14
00:00:13,562 --> 00:00:15,231
EARLY OR THE GLOBAL

15
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:15,965
PERCEPTION THAT THEY'RE.

16
00:00:15,965 --> 00:00:17,433
WHO BETTER THAN TO GET A

17
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:18,601
READ OF THIS THAN A WOMAN

18
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,102
WHO WILL BE VISITING THE

19
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,238
COUNTRY AGAIN ARIZONA

20
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:24,940
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN

21
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,342
KELLY McSALLY.

22
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:27,043
CONGRESSWOMAN, GOOD TO HAVE

23
00:00:27,043 --> 00:00:27,376
YOU ON.

24
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:29,211
>> GOOD TO BE ON, NEIL,

25
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:29,545
THANKS.

26
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:31,213
I'M GOING THERE NEXT WEEKEND

27
00:00:31,213 --> 00:00:32,848
LEADING A CONGRESSIONAL

28
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:33,282
DELEGATES.

29
00:00:33,282 --> 00:00:33,783
>> Neil: BE SAVE.

30
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:34,784
>> I WILL.

31
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:35,418
>> Neil: WHAT'S GOING ON

32
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:35,718
HERE.

33
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:36,285
>> HARD TO TELL.

34
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:38,521
COULD BE JUST SOME POSTURING

35
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,755
AND TRYING TO SHOW STRENGTH

36
00:00:39,755 --> 00:00:41,757
COMING UP TO THE SUMMIT.

37
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:44,193
BUT WE HAVE ALSO SEEN IN THE

38
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:46,128
PAST 1992 AND 2000 AND 2007,

39
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:47,430
WHERE THEY HAD A LOT OF NICE

40
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,498
WORDS ABOUT MOVING TOWARDS

41
00:00:49,498 --> 00:00:51,367
MORE OF A PEACE AND THEN IT

42
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,601
ENDED UP BEING NOTHING AND

43
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,138
THEY BACKTRACKED THEIR

44
00:00:56,138 --> 00:00:57,907
NORMAL OPPRESSIVE REGIME.

45
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:58,607
>> Neil: THEY HAVE A HISTORY

46
00:00:58,607 --> 00:00:59,075
OF LYING.

47
00:00:59,075 --> 00:01:02,111
>> THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF

48
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:02,445
LYING.

49
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:04,146
TRUST BUT VERIFY DISTRUST

50
00:01:04,146 --> 00:01:06,215
BUT VERIFY.

51
00:01:06,215 --> 00:01:07,883
HISTORIC OPENING WE HAVEN'T

52
00:01:07,883 --> 00:01:09,552
SEEN THANKS TO THE MAXIMUM

53
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:10,186
PRESSURE CAMPAIGN BY THE

54
00:01:10,186 --> 00:01:10,753
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

55
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:12,054
THE HARD WORK IS IN FRONT OF

56
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:12,588
US.

57
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:13,923
CAPABILITY, YOU KNOW, THREAT

58
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:14,857
EQUALS CAPABILITY PLUS

59
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:15,291
INTENT.

60
00:01:15,291 --> 00:01:16,392
RIGHT NOW CAPABILITIES ARE

61
00:01:16,392 --> 00:01:17,226
STILL THERE.

62
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:19,095
AS WAS JUST POINTED OUT.

63
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:20,329
THE WORDS HAVE CHANGED A

64
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:20,830
LITTLE BIT.

65
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,465
BUT THE HARD WORK WITH

66
00:01:22,465 --> 00:01:24,233
REALLY IN THE FRONT.

67
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:24,934
>> Neil: IF KIM JONG UN IS

68
00:01:24,934 --> 00:01:26,335
SAYING I HAVE NO INTERESTED

69
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,536
IN MEETING WITH MY SOUTH

70
00:01:27,536 --> 00:01:28,737
KOREAN COUNTER PART, DO WE

71
00:01:28,737 --> 00:01:29,805
STILL GO TO OUR WEDDING?

72
00:01:29,805 --> 00:01:31,207
>> I THINK THERE IS STILL A

73
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:32,441
LOT OF DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS

74
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:33,375
GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES

75
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:34,310
IN ORDER TO PREPARE FOR

76
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,610
THIS.

77
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,011
SO LET'S SEE HOW THE NEXT

78
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:36,645
DAYS UNFOLD.

79
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:38,114
THEY HAVE ONGOING EXERCISE

80
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:38,814
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE

81
00:01:38,814 --> 00:01:40,282
UNTIL THE END OF THE MONTH.

82
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:41,884
THEY HAVE AIR FORCE

83
00:01:41,884 --> 00:01:42,318
EXERCISE.

84
00:01:42,318 --> 00:01:43,252
>> Neil: YOU MEAN OUR JOINT

85
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:44,553
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH THE

86
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:45,154
SOUTH KOREANS?

87
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:46,555
>> YES.

88
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:47,223
>> Neil: ANYTHING THAT WE

89
00:01:47,223 --> 00:01:47,857
HAVE BEEN DOING DIFFERENT

90
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,991
DELAY WOULD HAVE PROMPTED

91
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:49,291
THIS?

92
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,259
>> NO.

93
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:51,727
WE, IN FACT, DELAYED THE

94
00:01:51,727 --> 00:01:52,428
INITIAL EXERCISE UNTIL AFTER

95
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:54,830
THE OLYMPICS, YOU KNOW, IN A

96
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,197
GOODWILL.

97
00:01:55,197 --> 00:02:00,503
THEY KNEW IT WAS COMING.

98
00:02:00,503 --> 00:02:02,071
>> Neil: DID WE TELL THEM IT

99
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:02,471
WAS COMING.

100
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,640
>> YES.

101
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,307
>> Neil: MISCOMMUNICATED OR

102
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:06,542
DIDN'T SEE COMING.

103
00:02:06,542 --> 00:02:08,110
>> THE AIR FORCE EXERCISES

104
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,711
STARTED YESTERDAY.

105
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,378
AND THEY GO UNTIL THE 25TH.

106
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:11,714
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

107
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,850
SHIFT OF A NEW EXERCISE THAT

108
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,351
STARTED.

109
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:17,553
>> Neil: WE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY

110
00:02:17,553 --> 00:02:18,154
MORE PROVOCATIVE.

111
00:02:18,154 --> 00:02:19,955
>> NOT AT ALL.

112
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,291
THESE EXERCISES ARE YEARLY.

113
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,192
SOUTH KOREAN COUNTERPARTS

114
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:24,460
MAKE SURE WE ARE READY TO

115
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:24,727
GO.

116
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,528
COMMAND AND CONTROL.

117
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,929
THIS IS WHAT WE DO ALL THE

118
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:27,897
TIME AND WE SHOULDN'T STOP

119
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,264
THEM.

120
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,298
IF THEY ARE TRYING TO GET TO

121
00:02:29,298 --> 00:02:30,566
US STOP THESE EXERCISES AND

122
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:31,600
THEY HAVEN'T CHANGED ONE

123
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,468
THING THAT WOULD BE

124
00:02:32,468 --> 00:02:32,835
DANGEROUS.

125
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:34,670
I WOULD NOT ADVISE THAT.

126
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,504
>> Neil: YOU WOULDN'T ADVISE

127
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:37,006
THAT WE CHANGE NOT STOP THE

128
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:37,973
EXERCISES BUT EITHER, I

129
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,543
DON'T KNOW, DON'T MAKE THEM

130
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:40,943
AS DRAMATIC.

131
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:41,644
>> NO WAY.

132
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:42,478
STAY THE COURSE NOW.

133
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:43,979
KEEP UP THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE

134
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:44,346
CAMPAIGN.

135
00:02:44,346 --> 00:02:45,481
WE HAVE A DIPLOMATIC OPENING

136
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:47,816
FOR SURE.

137
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:49,451
BUT, THE VICE SCRIPTS NEED

138
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,819
TO KEEP BEING VERY STRONG

139
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:51,720
UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY CHANGE

140
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,588
THEIR BEHAVIOR THAT THEY

141
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,190
WOULD ALLOW A FULL

142
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,791
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

143
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,394
PENINSULA VERIFIABLE.

144
00:02:58,394 --> 00:02:59,662
>> Neil: THE MEETING ON

145
00:02:59,662 --> 00:03:01,197
JUNE 129 CHANGING BEHAVIOR

146
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:01,497
THEN.

147
00:03:01,497 --> 00:03:02,531
>> SECRETARY POMPEO BEEN

148
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,632
OVER THERE A COUPLE TIMES

149
00:03:03,632 --> 00:03:04,867
NOW AND DOING A LOT OF

150
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:05,668
GROUND WORK BEHIND THE

151
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:06,335
SCENES IN ORDER TO PREPARE

152
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:07,503
FOR THAT MEETING ON

153
00:03:07,503 --> 00:03:07,970
JUNE 12TH.

154
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,605
SO, AGAIN, THIS IS A LONG

155
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,240
TIME BETWEEN NOW AND

156
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,607
JUNE 129.

157
00:03:11,607 --> 00:03:13,108
AND A LOT OF THINGS CAN

158
00:03:13,108 --> 00:03:14,343
HAPPEN DIPLOMATICALLY AND

159
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:15,044
THE ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO

160
00:03:15,044 --> 00:03:15,644
MAKE THE DECISION.

161
00:03:15,644 --> 00:03:17,213
WE ALWAYS HAD TO BE READY TO

162
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:17,746
WALK AWAIT A MINUTE

163
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:18,380
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID

164
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:18,881
THAT MANY TIMES.

165
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:21,917
THIS IS HIS.

166
00:03:21,917 --> 00:03:25,888
>> Neil: AHEAD OF THE

167
00:03:25,888 --> 00:03:27,389
MEETING.

168
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:28,190
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK THE

169
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,359
CHINESE IS PLAYING ANY ROLE

170
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,393
OR PRESSURE IN NORTH KOREA

171
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:32,728
THAT KIM JONG UN IS GIVING

172
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:33,662
THE IMPRESSION WE'RE GIVING

173
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:35,431
THE STORE AWAY BEFORE EVEN

174
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:35,864
SITTING DOWN?

175
00:03:35,864 --> 00:03:37,299
>> I THINK HE CERTAINLY

176
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:38,968
NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO SHOW

177
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,669
STRENGTH IN HIS OWN INTERNAL

178
00:03:40,669 --> 00:03:42,671
POLITICS AND OWN REGIME

179
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:43,739
DYNAMICS GOING ON.

180
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:47,743
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

181
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:48,344
>> Neil: OVERTURES MADE

182
00:03:48,344 --> 00:03:49,445
COULDN'T MAKE THEM IN A

183
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:49,778
VACUUM.

184
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,280
>> RIGHT.

185
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,281
>> Neil: PERCEPTION BETWEEN

186
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,116
THE POLICE OR THE HOSTAGES.

187
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,317
BETWEEN THE DENUCLEARIZATION

188
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:55,718
COMMISSION.

189
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:56,919
>> SHOWING WEAKNESS,

190
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,319
ESSENTIALLY.

191
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,220
AND, AGAIN, THAT DOESN'T

192
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,821
SURPRISE ME.

193
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,956
I'M NOT SAYING THAT I CAN'T

194
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:01,590
TELL YOU ABOUT CLASSIFIED

195
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,258
INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

196
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:03,092
THEY'RE ACTUALLY TALKING

197
00:04:03,092 --> 00:04:03,959
ABOUT INTERNALLY.

198
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,128
SO, HE IS TRYING TO, I

199
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:07,463
THINK, SHOW UP TO THE

200
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:08,130
NEGOTIATIONS POTENTIALLY

201
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,498
WITH GREATER STRENGTH

202
00:04:09,498 --> 00:04:13,469
INSTEAD OF WEAKNESS.

203
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:14,169
>> Neil: NOTHING HAS BEEN

204
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:14,536
CANCELLED.

205
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:17,139
>> I'M STILL HEADING OVER

206
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:19,875
THERE WE'RE NOT GOING NORTH.

207
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:20,875
WE'RE GOING.

208
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:21,610
>> Neil: WORRIED THAT ALL OF

209
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,411
THE SUDDEN THE NORTH DOESN'T

210
00:04:22,411 --> 00:04:23,212
WANT TO MEET WITH.

211
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:24,980
THEY WOULD YOUR MEETING BE

212
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,347
POINTLESS?

213
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:26,315
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY

214
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:27,483
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO GET ON

215
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:28,917
THE GROUND WITH THIS

216
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:29,518
DELEGATES, TALK TO THE

217
00:04:29,518 --> 00:04:30,853
TROOPS, TALK TO THE EMBASSY,

218
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,621
SEE WHAT'S ACTUALLY

219
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,922
HAPPENING REALTIME AND GET A

220
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:35,491
REAL SENSE FIRSTHAND.

221
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:36,325
>> Neil: HAVE THEY TALKED TO

222
00:04:36,325 --> 00:04:37,426
YOU, CONGRESSWOMAN TO SAY WE

223
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:38,093
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP?

224
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:39,361
>> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING

225
00:04:39,361 --> 00:04:41,030
BOWER PLANS FOR OUR TRIP BUT

226
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,931
WE'LL SEE WHEN WE GET ON THE

227
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:43,332
GROUND.

228
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:43,866
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

229
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,168
THE PRESIDENT, OF COURSE,

230
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:52,207
HAS BEEN STATE DEPARTMENT

231
00:04:52,207 --> 00:04:53,942
WE'RE STILL GOING.

232
00:04:53,942 --> 00:04:55,711
>> I THINK RIGHT NOW, AGAIN,

233
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:56,812
THIS IS JUST NEW NECESSARY.

234
00:04:56,812 --> 00:04:57,813
WE NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

235
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:58,881
IN THE DAYS AHEAD.

236
00:04:58,881 --> 00:04:59,882
I THINK IT'S RIGHT TO

237
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,550
CONTINUE TO PLAN TOWARDS

238
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:01,917
JUNE 12TH.

239
00:05:01,917 --> 00:05:02,818
BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

240
00:05:02,818 --> 00:05:04,386
WILLING TO WALK AWAY.

241
00:05:04,386 --> 00:05:05,254
AND THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

242
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:05,954
VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

243
00:05:05,954 --> 00:05:07,356
WE ARE NOT GIVING AWAY THE

244
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:07,690
FARM.

245
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,024
WE HAVE VERY CLEAR

246
00:05:09,024 --> 00:05:10,592
OBJECTIVES OF MAKING SURE NO

247
00:05:10,592 --> 00:05:11,727
AMERICAN CITY IS GOING TO BE

248
00:05:11,727 --> 00:05:13,829
HELD HOSTAGE BY A NUCLEAR

249
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:14,697
WEAPON WITH NORTH KOREA.

250
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:16,332
WE WILL USE ALL ELEMENTS OF

251
00:05:16,332 --> 00:05:17,499
NATIONAL POWER, ECONOMIC,

252
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,836
DIPLOMAT I

253
00:05:20,836 --> 00:05:22,971
DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY IF.

254
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,239
WE WILL SEE WHAT PATH HE

255
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,574
CHOOSES TO TAKE.

256
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:26,442
>> Neil: A BULLETIN COMING

257
00:05:26,442 --> 00:05:28,143
IN THE EUROPEAN UNION IS

258
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:30,746
LOOKING AT EFFORTS TO

259
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:31,680
SALVAGE THE IRAN DEAL

260
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,881
FOLLOWING OUR WITHDRAWAL.

261
00:05:32,881 --> 00:05:33,649
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY HAVE

262
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,283
NOT JOINED US.

263
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:38,053
THAT IS ENGLAND, FRANCE,

264
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,588
GERMANY DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING

265
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:40,923
ABOUT RUSSIA AND CHINA.

266
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,024
BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO

267
00:05:42,024 --> 00:05:42,424
SALVAGE IT.

268
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:43,425
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT

269
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:43,726
MEANS.

270
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:45,961
IT'S A CRAPPY WE HAVE SAID

271
00:05:45,961 --> 00:05:46,729
THAT ALL ALONG.

272
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:48,731
THEY HAVE HAD 16 MONTHS TO

273
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:51,500
ADDRESS THESE VERY REAL SUN

274
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,302
SET LAWS THEY HAVE A PATH TO

275
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:55,070
A BOMB IT DOESN'T ADDRESS

276
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,671
THEIR BALLISTIC MISSILE

277
00:05:55,671 --> 00:05:56,472
DEVELOPMENT AND DOESN'T

278
00:05:56,472 --> 00:06:00,576
ADDRESS ALL THEIR MALIGNED

279
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,978
ACTIVITIES AND STATE SPONSOR

280
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:03,712
OF TERROR.

281
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:04,980
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE

282
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,048
CAUSING IRAN WHETHER IT'S IN

283
00:06:06,048 --> 00:06:08,250
YEMEN OR SYRIA OR ATTACKING

284
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,184
ISRAEL, THIS IS ALL BECAUSE

285
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:10,853
OF INFLUX OF CASH THAT THE

286
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:12,254
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ALLOWED

287
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:13,088
FOR THEM.

288
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:14,323
THE EUROPEANS HAVE TO DECIDE

289
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:15,157
WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO BE

290
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,459
WITH US AND STABILIZATION OR

291
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:18,594
LOOKING THROUGH GREEN

292
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:19,428
GLASSES ONLY ABOUT DOING

293
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:20,129
BUSINESS WITH IRAN.

294
00:06:20,129 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HAVE SOME TOUGH
