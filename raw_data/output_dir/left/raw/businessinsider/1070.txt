right out of school thank you these

175
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,950
judges brought me up in the law truly I

176

would not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> here without them today is</font>

177
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,320
as much their day as it is mine in the

178
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,450
balance of my professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> life I've had</font>

179
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the privilege of working as a practicing</font>

180
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,320
lawyer and teacher I've enjoyed

181
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,900
wonderful colleagues who support means

182
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,340
so much for me at this moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it has</font>

183
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,460
year in and year out practicing and the

184
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,070
trial work trenches of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the law I saw to</font>

185
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,020
that when we judges Donna rogues it

186
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,050
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> us any smarter but it does</font>

187
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,460
serve as a reminder of what's expected

188
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:55,040
us impartiality and independence

189
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,510
collegiality and courage as this process

190
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,550
now moves to the Senate I look forward

191
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,290
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking with members from both</font>

192
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,990
sides of the aisle to answering their

193
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,120
questions and to hearing their concerns

194
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,970
I consider the United States<font color="#CCCCCC"> Senate the</font>

195
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,560
greatest deliberative body in the world

196
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,410
and I respect the important role the

197
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,060
Constitution affords in the confirmation

198
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our judges</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I respect to the fact that</font>

199
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,010
in our legal order it is for Congress

200
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:26,160
and not the courts to write new law it

201
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,260
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a role of judges to apply not alter</font>

202
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work of the people's representatives</font>

203
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,150
a judge who likes every outcome he

204
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,500
reaches is very likely a bad judge

205
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,090
stretching for results he prefers rather

206
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,260
than those<font color="#E5E5E5"> the law demands I am so</font>

207
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,110
thankful tonight for my family my
