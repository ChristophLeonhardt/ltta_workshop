61
00:01:56,747 --> 00:01:59,081
TRUMP'S NOMINATION WITHOUT EVEN

62
00:01:59,082 --> 00:02:00,850
GIVING IT A SECOND THOUGHT.

63
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:04,053
NEVADA WANTS AN INDEPENDENT

00:02:04,054 --> 00:02:06,322
VOICE.

65
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:09,325
>> IN THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF

66
00:02:09,326 --> 00:02:11,527
EARLY VOTING, DEMOCRATIC VOTERS

REPUBLICANS CAST 36%.

69
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:18,100
BUT SENATOR HELLER LIKES HIS

70
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:19,702
CHANCES BECAUSE HE THINKS THE

71
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:20,703
CAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION CHAOS

72
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:21,404
KEPT THE G.O.P. EXCITED JUST

73
00:02:21,405 --> 00:02:23,673
LONG ENOUGH.

74
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:25,474
>> LET ME TELL YOU MY CONCERN ON

75
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:29,278
ALL OF THIS.

76
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,314
KAVANAUGH HAPPENED TOO QUICK.

77
00:02:31,315 --> 00:02:32,415
I WANTED THAT MOMENTUM TO

78
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:33,416
CONTINUE TO EARLY VOTING, AND IT

79
00:02:33,417 --> 00:02:39,188
HAS OCCURRED.

80
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:40,489
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA'S PITCH HERE

81
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,324
ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRATIC

82
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:42,391
CANDIDATES WAS LESS ABOUT THEIR

83
00:02:42,392 --> 00:02:43,926
RECORDS AND MORE ABOUT HIS OWN

84
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:44,694
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS TALKING

85
00:02:44,695 --> 00:02:47,730
ABOUT THE ECONOMY.

86
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:50,900
BUT THE CROWD ATE IT UP, ROUGHLY

87
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,501
2,000 PEOPLE CAME TO HEAR HIM

88
00:02:52,502 --> 00:00:00,000
SPEAK AND THAT IS LESS THAN HALF
