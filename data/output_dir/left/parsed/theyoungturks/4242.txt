>> AN ISLAMIC CENTER IN
SUBURBAN MINNEAPOLIS WAS
TARGETED WITH EXPLOSIVES,
LUCKILY NO ONE HAS DIED AS A
RESULT.
THIS IS THE CULMINATION
OF A NUMBER OF THREATS THAT WAS
SENT TO A NUMBER OF ISLAMIC
CENTERS IN THE AREA.
BECAUSE
THERE IS A BIG SOMALI COMMUNITY
LIVING THERE, SOME ARE WORRIED
THIS WILL BECOME COMMONPLACE.
AS
FAR AS WE KNOW, THEY HAVE NOT
IDENTIFIED A SUSPECT.
THEY ARE
OFFERING A $24,000 REWARD FOR
ANYONE WITH INFORMATION.
USUALLY
WHEN STORIES LIKE THIS BREAK AND
MAKE HEADLINES, PEOPLE DON'T
REFER TO IT AS A HATE CRIME OR A
TERRORIST ACT.
BUT SURPRISINGLY
THE GOVERNOR SPOKE OUT ABOUT
THIS.
>> MARK DAYTON IS SUCCESSFUL IN
MINNESOTA.
IT IS GOOD TO SEE HIM
BEING CLEAR ABOUT THIS.
BUT THAT
SENTENCE SHOWS OUR MINDSET AS A
COUNTRY.
THIS IS AGAINST THE LAW
IN AMERICA.
YOU HAVE TO CLARIFY
THAT?
IF THERE WAS A MUSLIM
TERRORIST AND HE HAD DONE A
BOMBING AT A CHURCH NO ONE WOULD
HAVE TO REFRESH YOUR
RECOLLECTION THAT IS AGAINST THE
LAW IN AMERICA.
SOMETIMES IT
TURNS OUT SOMEONE THAT IS
INTERNAL FOR ATTENTION.
IT 
IS
UNLIKELY, BUT POSSIBLE.
WHAT IS
FAR MORE LIKELY IS THAT IT WAS
DIRECTED AT MUSLIMS BECAUSE OF
THE CLIMATE OF FEAR AND HATRED.
THERE ARE LAYERS TO DIFFERENT
KINDS OF INTIMIDATION OR HATE
CRIMES.
CALLING UP AND SAYING
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU ALL ñ THAT
USED TO BE A SERIOUS THING BUT
NOW IS COMMONPLACE, WHICH IS
TERRIBLE.
THEN THERE IS GOING
AFTER ñ MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I AM
AGNOSTIC, I DON'T CARE THAT
MUCH.
BUT THE SWASTIKAS ARE
TERRIBLE.
A BOMB IS A BOMB.
IT
REMINDED ME OF THE BOMBINGS OF
BLACK CHURCHES DURING THE CIVIL
RIGHTS ERA.
SOMETIMES BOMBS GO
OFF AND NO ONE DIES.
WHEN IT
WENT OFF IN THE 16TH ST.,
BAPTIST CHURCH, FOR LITTLE GIRLS
DIED.
YOU CAN TIME A BOMB TO GO
OFF AT A CERTAIN TIME, BUT IT
ALWAYS GOES OFF ON ANOTHER TIME
SOMETIMES.
THIS IS A GIANT DEAL.
IT HAPPENED UNDER A DIFFERENT
CONTEXT, IT WOULD JUST BE SAYING
LOOK AT THE GOVERNOR CALLING IT
AN ACT OF TERRORISM.
IF IT WAS
MUSLIMS VERSUS THE CHURCH, WE
WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT IT 24
SEVEN.
YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE A
GIANT EVENT, TRUMP WOULD'VE
TWEETED ABOUT IT ENDLESSLY.
BUT
WHEN MUSLIMS ARE ATTACKED IT IS
LIKE HEY, SOMEONE AT CALL IT AN
ACT OF TERRORISM PLEASE.
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS
THERE ARE BAD PEOPLE FROM ALL
WALKS OF LIFE.
THERE SHOULD BE A
PROPER INVESTIGATION, AND EACH
CRIME SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH THE
SAME TYPE OF LEGAL WEIGHT.
I
KNOW THE PERCEPTION IN THE MEDIA
IS THAT IT IS ONLY ONE GROUP
DOING ALL 
THE BAD THINGS.
THERE
ARE ALSO INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T
IDENTIFY AS MUSLIM THE DO
TERRIBLE THINGS.
THAT PERSON WHO
SHOT UP A PLANNED PARENTHOOD,
THAT WAS A BIG STORY.
IT SHOWS
YOU THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE
POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.
AND PAST
CASES THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WERE
NOT MUSLIM AND ARE POLITICALLY
MOTIVATED AND CARRY OUT
TERRORISTIC ACTIONS.
MY POINT IS
I AM NOT SITTING HERE TRYING TO
SAY MUSLIMS ARE GOOD.
THERE ARE
BAD PEOPLE FROM ALL WALKS OF
LIFE AND WE NEED TO STOP
PRETENDING LIKE ONE GROUP
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG AND
ONE GROUP IS ALWAYS GUILTY.
WE
JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE WE
PROTECT OUR CITIZENS BY CARRYING
OUT JUSTICE FOR ALL GROUPS OF
PEOPLE WHO CARRY OUT TERRORISTIC
THREATS.
>>THE GOVERNOR CALLED AN ACT OF
TERRORISM, SAID HE HAS ENOUGH
INFORMATION TO SAY IT IS WHAT
HAPPENED.
PENDING THE FULL
INVESTIGATION WE WILL
GIVE YOU AN UPDATE.
RIGHT-WING EXTREMISTS DO
TWICE AS MUCH TERRORISM IN
AMERICA AS MUSLIM EXTREMISTS.
>>THEY CARRY OUT TWICE AS MANY
BECAUSE THERE ISN'T AS MUCH
FOCUS ON RIGHT-WING TERRORISM IN
THE COUNTRY.
WHEN IT COMES TO
FOILING TERRORISTIC PLOTS, LAW
ENFORCEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES
IS REALLY GOOD AT FOILING PLOTS
THAT ARE ATTEMPTED BY MUSLIM
GROUPS.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO
OTHER NON-MUSLIM, RIGHT-WING
ORGANIZATIONS, OR GROUPS, IT'S
NOT THE SAME.
THERE ISN'T AS
MUCH ATTENTION PAID TO THAT.
>>MY POINT IS, IF YOU LOOK AT
THE PROPORTIONALITY BASED ON THE
PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION,
IT'S STILL NOT GREAT NEWS FOR
MUSLIMS OVERALL.
BUT YOU ARE
MIS-ALLOCATING RESOURCES ñ GREAT
CREDIT TO THE FBI AND OTHERS WHO
ARE FOILING THOSE PLOTS.
THAT
KEEPS US SAFER.
I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING BLOWN UP AT ALL.
WE ALL
WANT TO BE SAFE.
IF
RIGHT-WINGERS ARE DOING 
IT A TWO
TO ONE RATIO, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
ENOUGH PEOPLE FOILING THOSE
PLOTS BECAUSE THERE ARE TWICE AS
MANY OF THEM HENCE ENDANGERING
ALL OF US TWICE AS MUCH.
LET'S
PUT ENOUGH RESOURCES BEHIND
THOSE DIFFERENT GROUPS DOING
THOSE TERRORISTIC
ACTIVITIES AS WE LIKELY SEE HERE
IN MINNESOTA.
