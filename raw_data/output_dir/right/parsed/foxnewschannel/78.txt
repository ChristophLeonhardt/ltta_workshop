MADE US LAUGH THAT WAS CUTE.
BRIAN: BIG STATE, BIG FUN, JESS
EWATERS IS A BIG STAR.
STEVE: THAT WAS HOUSTON OF THE
COUPLE HUNDRED MILES TO THE
NORTH IN DALLAS, FORD STADIUM,
BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS OF SMU WHERE
ONE OF THE DOOCY CHILDREN DID
ONCE UPON A TIME DID ATTEND,
JESSE WATTERS.
JESSE, PEOPLE OF TEXAS ARE
EXCITED ABOUT THE SENATE RACE,
AREN'T THEY?
>> IT'S A HOT RACE.
TRUMP IS UP ABOUT SEVEN.
I THINK BETO IS GOING DOWN.
HE CHANGED HIS NAME.
WHO DOES THAT.
AINSLEY, YOU NEVER CHANGED YOUR
NAME.
I NEVER CHANGED MY NAME.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THAT IS
ABOUT.
IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR HIM.
LIKE THE REPORTER JUST SAID,
LIKE BIEBER MANIA.
PEOPLE PITCHING TENTS.
IT IS ELECTRIC.
"THE FIVE" IS DOWN HERE TO FEEL
THE PULSE OF THE SITUATION DOWN
HERE.
JUAN MIGHT HANG OUT WITH BETO.
WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THAT HE
HAS KIND OF GOT BETO FEVER.
IT IS GOING TO BE A FUN TIME
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE DOWN
HERE AT SMU TAKING QUESTIONS
FROM COLLEGE STUDENTS.
I'M NERVOUS BECAUSE USUALLY I'M
ASKING THE QUESTIONS.
SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE TURNING
THE TABLE ON US.
WE WENT TO A BARBECUE JOINT LAST
NIGHT.
I THINK GREG IS STILL ASLEEP.
HE HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH SWEET
TEA.
BUT WE'RE HAVING A LOT OF FUN
DOWN HERE.
STEVE: YEAH.
BRIAN: JESSE, WHEN YOU GO ON THE
ROAD WITH A CREW LIKE YOU GO ON
THE ROAD, EITHER BRINGS YOU
CLOSER OR BRINGS YOU APART.
I KNOW IT IS EARLY IN THE TRIP
BUT DO YOU SENSE AN ADDITIONAL
BONDING GOING ON AMONGST
"THE FIVE" AND THE CREW AND THE
PRODUCERS OR ARE YOU COMING
APART?
>> I THINK DANA AND I HAVE
BONDED.
GREG AND I ARE KIND OF, YOU
KNOW, COULD BE BETTER.
LAST NIGHT WAS A LITTLE ROUGH.
HE LIKES TO HOG A LOT OF THE
ATTENTION.
BRIAN: GREG IS NOT NORMAL,
JESSE.
YOU ARE.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WITH STEVE.
STEVE TRIES TO DOMINATE THE
SITUATION.
STEVE: RIGHT NOW.
DARN IT.
>> LIKE RIGHT NOW.
BUT WE'RE ALL GETTING ALONG.
JUAN'S NOT HERE.
WE ALWAYS ASK, WHERE IS JUAN?
APPARENTLY JUAN'S COMING BUT WE
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM YET.
HOPEFULLY HE WILL BE HERE TODAY.
AINSLEY: HE DOESN'T WANT TO
TRAVEL WITH YOU.
JESSE TELL DANA, HIGHLAND PARK
VILLAGE, HERE IN NEW YORK, ALL
THE SHOPS ARE SPREAD OUT, MY
FAVORITE THING TO DO, HERS IS
TOO, GO TO A MALL.
SHE IS THERE IN DALLAS.
HIGHLAND PARK VILLAGE.
ABOUT THE AWESOME STORES.
STEVE: ABOUT A MILE FROM WHERE
YOU'RE SITTING.
>> MEN LIKE SHOPPING TOO.
WHY CAN'T I GO TO THE MALL AND
SHOP, AINSLEY?
AINSLEY: NOT ALL MEN.
>> I WILL TELL HIM YOU SAID
THAT.
STEVE: "THE FIVE" LIVE FROM
DALLAS, TEXAS.
AINSLEY: MICACINA IS THE FAMOUS
RESTAURANT.
BRIAN: ARE YOU WRITING ANY OF
THIS DOWN.
>> NO ONE IS CHASING THE
"THE FIVE" OUT.
