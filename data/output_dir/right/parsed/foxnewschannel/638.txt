AS THE DAY DEVELOPS.
BACK TO YOU.
ELIZABETH: BRET INGLE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.
MOVING ON TO THE HEADLINES TODAY
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE ALEXANDRIA
AND IS ONE DEMOCRAT AMONG MANY
NOW DOUBLING DOWN TO ABOLISH ICE
NOW DOUBLING DOWN TO ABOLISH IC
ICE.
OFFICE UNTIL THE KIDS ARE BACK
WITH THEIR PARENTS.
WE NEED TO REBUILD OUR
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM FROM TOP TO
BOTTOM STARTING BY REPLACING
ICE.
WHAT ICE IS DOING TODAY.
I BELIEVE WE SHOULD GET RID OF
IT AND START OVER, REIMAGINE IT.
ELIZABETH: OTHER CANDIDATES
BELIEVE THE SAME THING.
THOSE COMMENTS I WAS GETTING
PUSHED BACK.
THE SPRING IN OUR POLITICAL
PANEL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF
LOOKAHEAD AMERICA AND JOSE
JUDGMENT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING
US.
I THINK I KNOW WHERE YOU FALL ON
THIS SO I WANT TO START WITH
YOU, JOSE
YOU, JOSÃ‰.
TRUE OR FALSE, DEMOCRATS ARE
JUST THROWING CONDEMNATION AT
IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND NOT
PROVIDING A SOLUTION.
>> I DISAGREE.
WE'VE HAD A SOLUTION FROM DAY
ONE.
LET'S CAP PASS COMPANIES OF
IMMIGRATION REFORM.
2013, THAT'S OKAY, IT'S TOUGH TO
PASS, ABSOLUTELY.
BUT THIS IS MY MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS GOT ELECTED
BUT THIS IS MY MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS GOT ELECTED TO TALK
WITH.
ELIZABETH: BUT THAT'S ALSO WHY
THEY HAVE THE LOWEST APPROVAL
RATING THE ELECTED OFFICE
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GET
IMMIGRATION REFORM DONE.
>> BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP OF
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT ALLOWING
PASS THE SENATE BILL AND BLOCKED
THE REPUBLICANS.
ELIZABETH: IF THERE IS AN
OPPORTUNITY AND MY SAY THEY TAKE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY MAKES YOU THINK
THAT PASS IMMIGRATION REFORM IF
UNDER OBAMA TRIED TO DO
HEALTHCARE AND DID A TERRIBLE
JOB.
THE CAP NEXT IMMIGRATION MEN
BECAUSE THEY ARE A SUPER
MAJORITY IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND
DO NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
NOW I DO BELIEVE COMING TOGETHER
WITH COPIES OF SOLUTION AND THAT
IS AIDING AND ABETTING
WITH COPIES OF SOLUTION AND THAT
IS AIDING AND ABETTING MS 13
WITH SANCTUARY CITIES AND AIDING
AND ABETTING CHILD BACK
TRAFFICKERS BY ALLOWING ANYONE
WHO SHOWS UP TO THE BORDER WITH
OUT TO BE CAUGHT AND RELEASED
INTO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WITHOUT
ACCOUNTABILITY OR HAVING A DNA
TEST TO PROVE THAT THE RELATED
TERM.
THESE POLICIES OF ABOLISHING ICE
ARE CREATING AN ANTI-
LAW-ENFORCEMENT COMPETENCE OF
SOLUTION THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE
INCREASING GETTING ON BOARD
WITH.
I'M ENTHUSIASTIC TO RUN AGAINST
US OR SEE THEM RUN ON THIS
ABOLISHING ICE AND RUNNING IN
2020.
I EXPECT THIS WING OF THE PARTY
THAT HAS BECOME SO LOUD AND
DOMINATED ALL THE NEWS CYCLES IS
GOING TO PUSH ABOLISHING ICE AND
WILL BE IN THE 2020 DEMOCRATIC
PROBLEM.
CONTROL.
DO THEY KNOW -- WHAT WILL THAT
DO IF WE ABOLISH ICE?
>> THIS IS THE TRUTH.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MATT,
THE MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS DON'T
WANT TO ABOLISH ICE.
PAST WHERE THE WOMEN AND MEN WHO
WERE.
>> DO YOU SUPPORT THE MEN AND
WOMEN DOING THIS JOB?
THEY SAT ON THE SIDELINES
INCLUDING THE MAJORITY LEADER.
>> NOT TRUE.
>> YES, IT'S A DATE.
ELIZABETH: ARE YOU SEEN A PUSH
FOR MODERATES ARE SAYING LET'S
BRING THAT IN A LITTLE BIT?
>> WE ADDED YOU AS A PARTY IN
THE LIBRA REBRAND ICE.
IT'S NOT A DEPORTATION FORCE.
AFTER THE REAL BAD GUYS,
TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL
ORGANIZATIONS AND THINGS OF THE
SUCH.
YOU KNOW AND YOU CANNOT SIT HERE
WITH A STRAIGHT FACE AND SAY
THAT ICE IS DOING THE RIGHT JOB
BECAUSE IT'S NOT.
>> LET ME TELL YOU.
IF YOU WERE TO PARENT IN THE
CHILD IS ILLEGAL CAUSE OF ORDER
WITH THE PAID COYOTE CBS WOULD
TAKE THAT CHILD AWAY FROM YOU
AND PERSECUTE YOU.
>> NO, NO, NO.
>> MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS WILL
DISAGREE AND THE MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS.
>> WE WILL FIND OUT IN NOVEMBER.
ELIZABETH: WE WILL SEE HOW SOME
OF THESE FAR LEFT CANDIDATES
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL --
WHEN WE SEE POLLING THAT SHOWS
MERIT-BASED IMMIGRATION IS
POPULAR ARE WE GOING TO SEE
CANDIDATES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE
AISLE GETTING BEHIND THAT?
LETS ARE WITH YOU, FOR THE.
>> DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS WHO
SIT AT A TABLE AND NEGOTIATE AND
FIND A MIDDLE GROUND THAT
REPRESENTS THE MAJORITY OF
AMERICANS WANT AND I KNOW YOU
WILL DISAGREE WITH ME AND I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO PASS BUT WE CAN DO
IT.
OF GET TOGETHER AND PUT THE
POLITICAL GAMES ASIDE AND PASS
