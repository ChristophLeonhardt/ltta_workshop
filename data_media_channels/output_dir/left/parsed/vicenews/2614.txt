repression is much worse than ever
many people have been killed thousand
people lift the country thousand people
are behind bars but the revolution did
not stop I could hear the screams of
those which been tortured and I don't
know when it's going to be my turn
the process is telling me that at least
19 people have done this happening every
night then has happened every night for
the last three years this is a
government that we meet regularly we
roll out the red carpet and yet we don't
appear to be willing to use that
leverage to actually address the human
right problems
