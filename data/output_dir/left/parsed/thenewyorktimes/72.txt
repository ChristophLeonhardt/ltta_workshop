“The government has
separated 2,000 kids
from their parents.”
“They are being held in
so-called tender-age
shelters.”
“Some of these kids might
not never potentially be
reunited with their mothers.”
“Even after all the
trauma and separation
that these kids
just went through,
their nightmare is
only getting worse.”
“Illegal entry is a crime,
as determined by Congress.”
“Every child that crosses
the border without permission
has an immigration
court case to fight.
The U.S. government is
actually expecting
these children, as
young as 18 months,
unable to speak, to
represent themselves
in court against a
government attorney.”
“Everyone in America,
including non-citizens,
have a right to fair trial.
However, under this
administration,
immigration judges are under
pressure to meet quotas.
They’re expected to close
700 cases every year,
and we’re seeing that
children’s cases are
being sped up.”
“We were recently in court
with a 3-year-old.”
“She can’t say anything,
not even her name.”
“The child can’t even sit
on the chair by herself.”
“We have to physically
pick up the child
and place her on the chair.”
“Some of them
talk about seeing
family members murdered.
It’s not uncommon for us to
have a 5-year-old describe
to us what a dead body
on the street looks like,
or how he heard bullets
from a gun being shot.
For many of these
kids, if they
get ordered deported, going
back to their home country
could mean death.”
“It’s up to Congress to
act, and give children
the right to attorneys
in immigration court.
These children are fighting,
not just to stay here,
but to live.
They deserve at least a
chance to a fair fight.”
