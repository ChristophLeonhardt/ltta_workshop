1
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:12,479
So Shakespeare knew better than 
anyone that for two hundred 

2
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,414
years they talked about 
hearing plays, 

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,750
you went to listen to a play.

4
00:00:22,622 --> 00:00:26,459
And Shakespeareâ€™s words have 
endured over the course of time,

5
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,162
and he performed, 
you know, open air,

6
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:32,131
and that is the tradition to 
listen to these plays 

7
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:35,402
with the baseline of sound 
being these woods 

8
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:37,771
or this natural setting.

9
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,952
And there is nothing quite like
the end of a play,

10
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:29,355
to have the story be done,
it go to blackout,

11
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,292
and the entire thousand seats 
look up to the sky, 

12
00:01:32,292 --> 00:00:00,000
and take a breath.
