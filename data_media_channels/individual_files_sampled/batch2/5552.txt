humph watch Friday June 8th 2018 I wish our president Godspeed on his way to Singapore along with a warning North Korea does not want what we want they want South Korea have wanted it since they invaded and nearly overrun that country in June of 1950 and to reach that goal going forward they want the United States to end its strategic alliance with the South removing our 32,000 troops from the 38th parallel the president should not be taken in by Kim Jong Un's talk of writing a peace treaty between North and South Korea that peace tree will have one clear purpose to remove the justification for our keeping those 32,000 troops now in the way of another invasion from the north the danger is that the president will agree to removing our troops in exchange for a promise from North Korea to kill its nuclear weapons program such a promise of course is worthless the only real step by the north would be to declare the number of weapons they have and stay where they are and allow them to be inspected President Reagan said trust but verify without verification there is no reason to believe a word Kim jong-un says a final warning we need to be specific about what we the United States agree to do if we agree to denuclearize the entire Korean Peninsula we need to specify that does not mean removing our troops that it does not mean ending our strategic alliance with South Korea we've removed our nuclear weapons from South Korea under the first president Bush it's time for Kim jong-un to do the same with his nuclear weapons under President Trump what matters is not the smiles or words of next week or the cheerfulness of the occasion it's the reality that arises from it will we be safer or not we've had Munich we've had Yalta let's not let Singapore join that list and that's hardball for now thanks for being with us all in with Chris Hayes starts right now hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click Subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
