1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
The sound of the
crinkling of paper,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,830
the movement of a
finger traveling

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,457
across smooth plastic —

4
00:00:06,457 --> 00:00:07,370
“Cool.”

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,985
— like capitalist A.S.M.R.

6
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:10,465
[whispering]
Capitalist A.S.M.R.

7
00:00:10,465 --> 00:00:12,510
“Awesome stickers.”

8
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,657
What is it about
unboxing videos?

9
00:00:15,657 --> 00:00:16,740
“I’m here to unbox it.”

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,636
“I love unboxing this thing.”

11
00:00:18,636 --> 00:00:20,683
“This is gonna be a pretty
big unboxing video.”

12
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:21,960
“Welcome to the unboxing.”

13
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,660
I mean, maybe we’re looking
to buy those actual things

14
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,450
and want to see them
almost in person first.

15
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,550
But there are now
74 million results

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,200
for “unboxing”
on YouTube, and I

17
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,660
don’t think the insane
popularity of these videos

18
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,622
is purely practical.

19
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:36,080
“I love these types
of duffel bags,

20
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,996
because what I do is I
fill them with make-up,

21
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:40,410
and then I just drop them
off at my dentist’s office.”

22
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,690
You know how it can be
oddly relaxing to walk

23
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,660
through a Target or a Costco
where all the products are

24
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,220
lined up and in your reach?

25
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,220
In meatspace, we call
that retail therapy.

26
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,280
On YouTube, it’s
unbox therapy.

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,710
We watch videos of
products that we will never

28
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,120
buy, never touch or taste —

29
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,295
“That looks delicious.”

30
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:01,830
— or even see in
our lifetimes.

31
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,900
In the same way that
videos of people consuming

32
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,870
mass amounts of food 
can be read as a

33
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,990
strange commentary

34
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,170
on underlying eating
issues, unboxing videos

35
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,250
reflect a culture that
has issues with stuff —

36
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,990
like America, where 
capitalism creates

37
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,062
desires for things we 
didn’t even know we wanted.

38
00:01:20,062 --> 00:01:22,860
“I promise this is my last
fidget spinner YouTube

39
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:23,835
video.”

40
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:27,150
And the internet has
exploded that feeling.

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,100
Everything we could
ever want feels

42
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,370
hypothetically accessible,
almost touchable,

43
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,680
but just out of our grasp.

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,660
We’re hyper aware of
everything we could have

45
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,525
but don’t.

46
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:38,680
“I’m so mad right now.

47
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,080
You guys literally
have no idea.

48
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,275
I just got back from
Bath and Body Works.”

49
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:46,320
Now, the idea of not being
able to buy the very specific

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,640
item that we desire —

51
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,335
“My peach bellinis.”

52
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:50,340
— is an outrage.

53
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,627
“Give me my candles now.”

54
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:54,090
Conspicuous
consumption is what

55
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,670
happens when capitalism
produces more stuff

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,680
than people need to survive.

57
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,230
We start buying things that
don’t have any use other than

58
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,520
to project status.

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,580
The point is that
it’s unnecessary.

60
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,699
But there’s a different flavor
to online product fetishism.

61
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,940
This is a private
vicarious thrill.

62
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,550
The internet feeds an
impulse to consume not just

63
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,320
luxury goods, but
mass quantities

64
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,380
of all kinds of stuff
to help us somehow

65
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,720
visually process all
of the products that

66
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,910
are put in front of our faces
every second we’re online.

67
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,430
Binging unboxing videos
is like mainlining shopping —

68
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,420
virtually consuming
more things than you could

69
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,870
ever actually consume, 
without any of the

70
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,870
friction of trying

71
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,630
on clothes, tracking
a lost package

72
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:39,330
or actually interacting
with another human being.

73
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,710
And they crystallize
the product

74
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,690
at its most valuable stage —

75
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,808
right after it comes
out of the box.

76
00:02:44,808 --> 00:02:47,000
[screaming]

77
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,220
That’s one reason
why unboxing videos

78
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,933
are so popular among kids.

79
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:53,075
“Open more Kinder Joy.”

80
00:02:53,075 --> 00:02:54,950
Children are surrounded
by materialism

81
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,930
but lack the
agency and the cash

82
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,510
to actually buy
anything themselves.

83
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,520
And now, they’re
starting to want stuff

84
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,680
just because it comes
out of a package,

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,710
like these L.O.L. Surprise!
dolls, specifically inspired

86
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,301
by unboxing videos.

87
00:03:08,301 --> 00:03:09,470
“Wow.”

88
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:12,200
But usually, when the
product is unboxed,

89
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,820
the spell is broken.

90
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,117
It looks dinky,
plastic, useless.

91
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:20,429
“Hey, she’s a crier.”

92
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:21,870
“Mine spits.”

93
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,035
Often, unboxers
look visibly bored.

94
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:25,595
“I'm super excited.”

95
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:26,600
“Mhm.”

96
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Maybe these videos help us
scratch a materialist itch

97
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,760
without forcing us to
actually spend a ton of money

98
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,950
on QVC or whatever.

99
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,260
But they also allow
our desire for things

100
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,950
to digitally replicate,
basically endlessly.

101
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,100
It’s just that now, instead of
hoarding stuff in our living

102
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,233
rooms, we’re filling
our brains with it.

103
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,402
[laughing]

104
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,208
“Oh, my god.

105
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:48,612
No way!”

106
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:52,380
Are we eliminating a
desire or creating one?

107
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,135
Hey, this is Amanda.

108
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:55,950
This is Shane.

109
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,184
He edits the videos.

110
00:03:57,184 --> 00:03:58,627
She writes the videos.

111
00:03:58,627 --> 00:03:59,710
You watch the videos.

112
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,125
And if you like the videos,

113
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:02,865
like, comment and 
subscribe here.

114
00:04:02,865 --> 00:04:03,945
And then tell us:

115
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:06,039
How are you coping with
late capitalism?

116
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,503
Hm, with food.

117
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,733
Tell us in the comments.

118
00:04:08,733 --> 00:04:11,003
We are very thirsty.

119
00:04:11,003 --> 00:00:00,000
[singing] “Internetting
with Amanda Hess.”
