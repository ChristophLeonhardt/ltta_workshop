we have to be realistic about the challenges the challenges opposed by Russia are far greater than the challenges that were presented as an insurgency in terms of Iraq and Afghanistan Oh Russia and the perceived threat coming from the Kremlin was the top of the agenda at the g7 meeting in Toronto in Canada officials there described Moscow's behavior as irresponsible and destabilizing the UK's Foreign Secretary called for joint efforts against Moscow what we decided was that we were going to set up a g7 group that would look at Russian malign behavior in all its manifestations whether it's cyber war whether it's disinformation assassination attempts whatever it happens to be and collectively try and call it out live now to world affairs journalist and author Neil Clark welcome back to our tea Neil what's the main reason I call it behind the defense secretary Gavin Williamson in highlighting Russia as a potential global threat what's the thinking there I mean this is the real divide between the neocon establishment in Britain and the rest of the country because Russia is not a threat Russia is not a threat to the British people or to Britain but it is a threat to the neocon plan for for regime change in Syria is thwarted that and for possible war with Iran so that's why Russia's been demonized by these neoconservative politicians in Britain Russia does not pose a threat to British citizens Russia did not Massacre British tourists in Tunisia in 2015 Russia did Massacre concert goers in Manchester Arena a year ago did it he actually was forces they were actually facilitating the help by the British government in their regime change operation so I'm gonna be clear here who the threat is the threat is actually at home the British government has been backing jihadists in Syria so-called rebels around the world etc Afghanistan which I Dean back in the 80s and it's these people who are the threat not Russia because Russia has done nothing wrong that's right British citizens and this is all in neocon demonization campaign I'm not very optimistic thoughts of the g7 though on this and with regards to Russia do you expect any action to come from that groups meeting in Canada there's some pretty diverse thoughts there I can't imagine that the Italians necessarily agreeing with the Germans or the French or necessary in the japanese on this so what do you expect to happen what's gonna happen colonies for other countries to actually stand up now make their voices loudly heard about this it can't be right that Britain and America are going around trying to bully other countries in Europe particularly against their own financial best interest to actually increase sanctions on Russia or to treat Russians in enemy Europe wants better links with Russia it wants the sanctions to be lifted European business wants that and that's the message that came out of the Yalta floor of last week which I attended the altar international economic for all we had visitors to Russia for over 400 400 people from I think over 60 countries but usually was loud and clear these countries in Europe which are unhappy about this I put a stand up now I make their voices heard they've got to represent their own people and not allow themselves to be bullied by countries like the US and the UK so I think that the other g7 countries now have got to stand up for themselves a bit more and it's same with the EU where we've got countries like Austria who I know are critical about the sanctions countries should come together now and say to the US and UK no no you know any more of this this ratcheting up with a call with Russia we actually want to see sanctions lifted and that would be good for European business and good for European jobs and so I think I think it's about time these countries stood up for themselves a bit more what if for the the g7 do end up on the same page we're still talking about a block of powerful countries and the EU is a powerful entity if that happens then what harm might that do to the anti-terror efforts in the Middle East he's gonna do enormous harm isn't it because who is fighting who has been fighting Isis whose by the pivotal role in defeating Isis in Syria it's been Russia who who has been the country that has actually done more to defeat or tried to feed the sort of groups you had his Bruce whose people whose followers were committing terrorist acts in Britain but it's been Russia not the British government the British government is intervening in Syria against a government backed by Russia that is fighting the jihadis so it's quite absurd this situation and as you said it's anti Russian campaign continues then the victims are going to be those people under threat for the journalists so I think it's time that the people in BRIC their voice is very loudly heard on this one to say enough is enough enough to an end to this retro phobia when I see a lifting of sanctions on Russia but unfortunately we're going the opposite way the government is pushing this pushing this more and more I'm afraid and you know I came back to England from Russia on sensit on Sunday night on the plane and we were met by a custom staff asking Russians and British people on that plane why'd you go to Russia why are you coming to Britain it's quite appalling that's Russia a phobia at the moment that's coming from above that's coming from the British government and I think they were all going to say enough is enough now on this and and and make our voices even more loudly heard whichever way you look at it we're a long way from Russian Western relations getting anywhere near back on track aren't we all right for now Neill clogged well the first journalist thanks very much for talking to us again
