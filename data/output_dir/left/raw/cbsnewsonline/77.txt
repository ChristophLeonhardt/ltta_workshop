77
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:15,935
WIN THE  GUBERNATORIAL PRIMARY. 

78
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,704
HOW CRUCIAL WAS THE PRESIDENTS 

79
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:21,741
ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE? 

80
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:22,441
FOR A LONG TIME, ADAM PUTNAM 

81
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:24,077
HAD THE LEAD.  

82
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,812
THEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED 

83
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,580
ABOUT  DESANTIS AND THINGS 

84
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,750
CHANGED.  

85
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,218
>> OH, THE DIFFERENCES A SINGLE 

86
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,253
TWEET CAN MAKE. 

87
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:33,887
RON DESANTIS WAS BEHIND, THEN 

88
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,589
SUDDENLY THE  PRESIDENT CAME 

89
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:41,161
ALONG, SUPPORTED HIM WITH A 

90
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,794
TWEET. 

91
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:42,595
THAT TWEET HAD A LOT OF 

92
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:42,895
AFFECTS. 

93
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:43,730
ONE OF THE EFFECTS WAS THAT IT 

94
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,497
GAVE A SIGNAL TO REPUBLICAN 

95
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,164
DONORS, BIG DONORS, ACROSS THE 

96
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:51,504

00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:51,904
TO RON DESANTIS. 

98
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:52,505
THAT PROVED USEFUL FOR HIM. 

99
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,172
BUT ALSO DESANTIS WAS FAMILIAR 

100
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:57,075
WITH THE GOP TRIPE  -- TYPE 

101
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:57,442
PRIMARY VOTER. 

102
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:58,778
HE RAN A CAMPAIGN OF LARGELY 

103
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:04,417
GOING -- NOT OPERATING A GROUND 

104
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,084
GAME, BUT GOING THROUGH THE 

105
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:05,284
AIR. 

106
00:03:05,284 --> 00:03:06,319
HE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO IT. 

107
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,457
HE EMBRACED DONALD TRUMP, HE 

108
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:11,991
NEVER SHIED AWAY. 

109
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:12,692
IT GOT HIM THE REPUBLICAN 

110
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:12,992
NOMINATION. 

111
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,960
NOW WE WILL SEE WHAT IT DOES IN 

112
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,527
THE GENERAL ELECTION, WHEN 

113
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,228
DEMOCRATS WILL TRY TO HANG 

114
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:20,133
DONALD TRUMP AROUND HIS NECK. 

115
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,033
>> IS THIS A LIVE PICTURE OF 

116
00:03:21,033 --> 00:03:21,300
DESANTIS? 

117
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,101
JIM, ARE YOU OKAY TO LISTEN IN 

118
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,904
FOR A MOMENT?  

119
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:25,171
>> SURE. 

120
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,606
>> -- REALIZE THIS VISION, IS 

121
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,274
EXERCISE LEADERSHIP. 

122
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:28,975
MOST PEOPLE WHO GET ELECTED TO 

123
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,943
PUBLIC OFFICE ARE NOT LEADERS. 

124
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:33,446
MOST OF THEM ARE POLITICIANS. 

125
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:34,213
A LEADER IS SOMEBODY WHO IS 

126
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:37,684
WILLING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT, 

127
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,651
EVEN WHEN IT IS NOT EASY, EVEN 

128
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,785
WHEN IT IS POLITICALLY 

129
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:40,353
DIFFICULT. 

130
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,187
IF YOU LOOK AT MY TRACK RECORD, 

131
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:48,828
FROM ATHLETICS TO THE MILITARY, 

132
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:49,762
TO FIGHTING TO DRAIN THE SWAMP 

133
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,362
IN WASHINGTON, I HAVE BEEN 

134
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:51,096
WILLING TO TAKE THE TOP STANDS, 

135
00:03:51,096 --> 00:03:52,265
THE PRINCIPLED POSITIONS, EVEN 

136
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:52,899
WHEN IT WAS DETRIMENTAL TO ME 

137
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:53,232
POLITICALLY. 

138
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,868
I HAD MORE MONEY SPENT 

139
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,270
NEGATIVELY ON ME THAN ALL THE 

140
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,138
OTHER CANDIDATES COMBINED ON 

141
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,073
BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. 

142
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,610
THAT IS FINE, I AM WILLING TO 

143
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,478
STAND UP, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT 

144
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,112
STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF 

145
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,080
FLORIDA IS THE RIGHT THING TO 

146
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,246
DO. 

147
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,781
SO I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE THERE 

148
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,183
IS NO LIMIT TO WHAT WE CAN 

149
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:10,883
ACCOMPLISH HERE, AS LONG AS YOU 

150
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,585

00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:14,953
AND I PLEDGE TO YOU, AS

OFF TO ACCOMPLISH GREAT THINGS 

154
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,160
FOR THIS STATE, I WILL SHOW THE 

155
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,100
COURAGE TO LEAD, AND WE WILL 

156
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,800
KEEP FLORIDA GREAT AND MAKE IT 

157
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,167
EVEN GREATER. 

158
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:28,968
GOD BLESS YOU GUYS, THANK YOU 

159
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:29,802

THANK YOU. 

161
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:36,476

TELL US WHAT THE STRATEGY WAS. 

167
00:04:46,018 --> 00:04:46,886
THE STRATEGY THAT ALLOWED HIM 

168
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,720
TO BE A VICTOR AGAINST A 

169
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,421
CANDIDATE WHO WAS VERY MUCH 

170
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,122
PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. 

171
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,023

00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:10,643
HAPPENED IN 2016.

SAME THING WITH ADAM PUTNAM.  

187
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:19,251
THAT IS WHAT YOU SEE NOW. 

188
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:20,219
YOU ARE SEEING THAT THIS IS THE 

189
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:20,786
COMPLETE TAKEOVER OF THE 

190
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:24,457
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN FLORIDA OF 

191
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:24,957
THE DONALD TRUMP ERA. 

192
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:25,757
>> WE SAW IN FACT PRESIDENT 

193
00:05:25,757 --> 00:05:27,093
TRUMP COME TO TAMPA  AND 

194
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:31,664
ACTUALLY RALLY ON BEHALF OF RON 

195
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:31,931
DESANTIS. 

196
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:32,798
HOW MUCH OF A FACTOR DO YOU 

197
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:33,599
THINK THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AS 

198
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,002
WELL?  

199
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:41,607
>> THAT WAS A BIG PART OF IT. 

200
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:42,442
I THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 

201
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,309
SEE THE PRESIDENT DOWN HERE A 

202
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:43,676
WHOLE LOT. 

203
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:44,410
WHAT WILL BE INTERESTING IS THE 

204
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:44,677
DYNAMIC. 

205
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,911
RON DESANTIS WILL EMBRACE  

206
00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:51,217
PRESIDENT TRUMP , HE WILL 

207
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:51,817
CAMPAIGN WITH DONALD TRUMP. 

208
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:52,552
IT WILL BE TRICKIER FOR RICK 

209
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:53,152
SCOTT, THE SENATE NOMINEE, 

210
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:53,753
RUNNING AGAINST BILL NELSON. 

211
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:54,653
SCOTT HAS TRIED NOT TO 

212
00:05:54,653 --> 00:05:57,223
NECESSARILY DISTANCE HIMSELF 

213
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:58,790
FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT HE 

214
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,892
HAS NOT EMBRACED HIM THE WAY 

215
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:00,726
THAT  RON DESANTIS HAD. 

216
00:06:00,726 --> 00:06:02,695
THERE COULD BE  INTERESTING 

217
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:07,500
JOCKEYING IN TERMS OF WHAT 

218
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,100
EVENTS THE CURRENT GOVERNOR 

219
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,934
GOES TO IN HIS SENATE RACE WHEN 

220
00:06:08,934 --> 00:06:10,336
IT COMES TO THE PRESIDENT, BUT 

221
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:14,373
I EXPECT TO SEE HIM DOWN HERE A 

222
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:14,573
LOT. 

223
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:15,341
>>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE 

224
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:16,175
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WHEN IT COMES 

225
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:16,708
TO THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. 

226
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:17,342
GWEN GRAHAM WAS CONSIDERED THE 

227
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:18,811
FAVORITE ,  BUT ANDREW GILLUM 

228
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,612
IS EXCEEDING  EXPECTATIONS. 

229
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:23,383
HOW SURPRISING IS THAT TO YOU? 

230
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:30,456
>> LOOK, ANDREW GILLUM IS MORE 

231
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:31,090
THAN EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS. 

232
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:31,690
THE LATEST NUMBERS, HE IS 

233
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:31,957
WINNING. 

234
00:06:31,957 --> 00:06:32,792
HE IS AHEAD RIGHT NOW.  

235
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:33,626
THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE 

236
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:34,994
BIGGEST STORIES IN THE COUNTRY 

237
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:38,531
TONIGHT, ANDREW GILLUM , AN 

238
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:39,131
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WHO IS NOT A 

239
00:06:39,131 --> 00:06:39,465
MILLIONAIRE. 

240
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,065
EVERY OTHER CANDIDATE ON THE 

241
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:40,566
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WAS. 

242
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,001
THEY EVEN HAD A BILLIONAIRE 

243
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,137
RUNNING AND PROVING THAT HE 

244
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:47,106
COULD WIN THIS RACE. 

245
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:47,840
NOW, THERE ARE THREE FACTORS 

246
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,375
THAT I THINK PLAYED A KEY ROLE 

247
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:53,145
IN ANDREW GILLUM'S SURGE AND 

248
00:06:53,145 --> 00:06:54,046
WHY HE IS IN THE LEAD. 

249
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,014
WE ARE NOT CALLING THAT FOR HIM 

250
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,516
YET, BUT HE IS AHEAD  BY A 

251
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:56,949
SUBSTANTIAL MARGIN. 

252
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,952
THE THREE FACTORS ARE -- BERNIE 

253
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:00,653
SANDERS CAME IN AND CAMPAIGNED 

254
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,020
WITH HIM. 

255
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,857
THAT WAS A HUGE ENDORSEMENT FOR 

256
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:05,224
ANDREW GILLUM. 

257
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:05,858
THAT GAVE HIM THE PROGRESSIVE 

258
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:06,091
LABEL. 

259
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:09,795
BERNIE SANDERS , APPEARING WITH 

260
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:10,196
HIM WAS KEY. 

261
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,264
IT ALSO MEANT THAT A LOT OF 

262
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:11,931
THAT PROGRESSIVE MONEY CAME IN. 

263
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,332
WHETHER IT WAS FROM TOM STEIN 

264
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,270
OR OTHERS THAT CAME IN AND 

265
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,404
SUPPORTED HIM. 

266
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:18,937
THE OTHER THING THAT WAS 

267
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,239
PIVOTAL, THE STATES STAND YOUR 

268
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:24,911
GROUND LAW. 

269
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:25,511
ANDREW GILLUM WAS AN EARLY 

270
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,279
OPPONENT OF STAND YOUR GROUND. 

271
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,079
HE MADE THAT A CENTRAL PART OF 

272
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:27,480
HIS CAMPAIGN.  

273
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,550
I THINK A LOT OF DEMOCRATS SAW 

274
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,184
ANDREW GILLUM'S OPPOSITION AS 

275
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:31,884
BEING SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD 

276
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,954
EMBRACE  AND REALLY GET BEHIND. 

277
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,888
AND THE THIRD THING, AND YOU 

278
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:36,522
CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THIS -- 

279
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:38,924
THERE WAS SO MUCH NEGATIVE 

280
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:40,092
ADVERTISING SPEND, BUT NONE OF 

281
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,827
IT AGAINST ANDREW GILLUM.  

282
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:45,964
WHAT YOU HAD WAS -- GWEN GRAHAM 

283
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:48,000
RUNNING ATTACK AS AGAINST OTHER 

284
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,370
CANDIDATES.  

285
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,038
JEFF GREEN, THEY WERE ALL 

286
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:52,705
RUNNING ATTACK ADS AGAINST EACH 

287
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,006
OTHER BUT NOBODY WAS TAKING A 

288
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,942
PUNCH AT ANDREW GUILLEN. 

289
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,575
IT WAS FOR A FEW THINGS. 

290
00:07:56,575 --> 00:08:00,412
ONE, HE WAS TRADITIONALLY 

291
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:01,447
FOURTH AND MOST OF THE POLLS, 

292
00:08:01,447 --> 00:08:01,947
SO HE WAS NOT LEADING. 

293
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:02,782
NOBODY WANTED TO PUNCH DOWN AND 

294
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,149
NOBODY WANTED TO BE IN THE 

295
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,719
POSITION OF ATTACKING AN 

296
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,319
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CANDIDATE, 

297
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,920
KNOWING HOW VITAL THAT VOTE 

298
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,288
WOULD BE  FOR THEM IN NOVEMBER. 

299
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:12,925
WELL, THAT STRATEGY OF KEEPING 

300
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:13,693
THEIR HANDS OFF OF ANDREW 

301
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:15,861
GILLUM APPEARS TO HAVE  

302
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,495
BACKFIRED ON GWEN GRAHAM AND 

303
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:17,797
RIGHT NOW HE IS AHEAD.  

304
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:21,434
>> JIM, WE HAVE AT O'KEEFE HERE 

305
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:22,435
WHO WANTS TO ASK YOU A 

306
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:22,702
QUESTION. 

307
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:23,870
>> JIM, IF THE CONVENTIONAL 

308
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,272
WISDOM WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO 

309
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:28,207
BE GWEN GRAHAM, WHO IS SEEN AS 

310
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,610
A MODERATE , MORE EXPERIENCED 

311
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,143
POLITICAL FIGURE, RUNNING 

312
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,613
AGAINST RON DESANTIS , THE 39-

313
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,748
YEAR-OLD CONGRESSMAN WHO 

314
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,950
BASICALLY WON THE REPUBLICAN 

315
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,616
PRIMARY BY APPEARING AS OFTEN 

316
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,219
AS HE COULD ON FOX NEWS. 

317
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,820
IF YOU SET UP A RACE BETWEEN A 

318
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,289
39-YEAR-OLD TRUMP BACKED 

319
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,157
REPUBLICA AND A 39-YEAR-OLD 

320
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:46,826
MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE, WHO DID 

321
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,260
IT ON THE BACK OF BERNIE 

322
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,763
SANDERS, THAT SCRAMBLES THINGS 

323
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:51,931
IN A WAY THAT PERHAPS FLORIDA 

324
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,265
HAS NOT SEEN BEFORE, BECAUSE 

325
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:57,269
YOU WILL HAVE A REAL PARTISAN 

326
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,903
REPUBLICAN RUNNING AGAINST A 

327
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,237
REAL PARTISAN LIBERAL DEMOCRAT. 

328
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:07,713
>> WHAT IS TRULY AMAZING IS -- 

329
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,447
THE DEMOCRATS GOT EXACTLY THE 

330
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,148
CANDIDATE THEY WANTED ON THE 

331
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:09,715
REPUBLICAN SIDE AND THE 

332
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,282
REPUBLICANS GOT EXACTLY THE 

333
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,584
CANDIDATE THEY WANTED ON THE 

334
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,486
DEMOCRAT SIDE. 

335
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:14,353
EACH ARE WAITING TO TEAR INTO 

336
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:14,653
THE OTHER. 

337
00:09:14,653 --> 00:09:15,821
I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE -- 

338
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:17,089
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A VERY 

339
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,393
NASTY RACE IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. 

340
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,030
THIS IS GOING TO BE AN 

341
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,930
EXPENSIVE RACE. 

342
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,797
YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF 

343
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:26,498
PROGRESSIVE MONEY COMING TO THE 

344
00:09:26,498 --> 00:09:26,732
STATE. 

345
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,466
YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF 

346
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:28,100
CONSERVATIVE MONEY COME INTO 

347
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,433
THE STATE. 

348
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:29,735
AND WHERE DOES THAT CENTER GO? 

349
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,270
YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 

350
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,437
LOST THE LAST FIVE GOVERNORS 

351
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,674
RACES BY NARROW MARGINS. 

352
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,574
AS I SAID IN THE LAST HOUR WHEN 

353
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:42,014
I WAS WITH YOU, FOUR YEARS AGO, 

354
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:42,614
THERE WERE ALMOST 6 MILLION 

355
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:42,915
VOTES CAST. 

356
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,582
THE SEPARATION WAS ABOUT 60,000 

357
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:44,350
VOTES. 

358
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,820
EIGHT YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A 

359
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,387
LITTLE MORE THAN 5 MILLION 

360
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:49,221
VOTES CAST, IT WAS ABOUT 60,000 

361
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:49,455
VOTES. 

362
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,356
THE THINKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- 

363
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,159
THE DEMOCRATS ELECT A MODERATE 

364
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,626
DEMOCRAT TO RUN IN THE PRIMARY, 

365
00:09:54,626 --> 00:09:55,627
HOPING THAT THEY CAN DRAW 

366
00:09:55,627 --> 00:09:56,996
VOTERS. 

367
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,966
THE ARGUMENT THAT ANDREW GILLUM 

368
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:01,901
HAS ALWAYS MADE IS THAT WE HAVE 

369
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,269
DONE ENOUGH  WITH NOMINATING 

370
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,439
MODERATE DEMOCRATS TO DRAW OFF 

371
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,875
REPUBLICAN VOTERS. 

372
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:10,843
WHAT YOU NEEDED TO DO WAS 

373
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,443
NOMINATE A TRUE PROGRESSIVE, 

374
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,478
ENERGIZE THAT PROGRESSIVE BASE, 

375
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:16,114
BRING OUT HISPANICS AND BLACKS, 

376
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,049
BRING THE TO THE POLLS, AND 

377
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:22,254
WIN IN THE SAME WAY THAT OBAMA 

378
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,389
DID IN FLORIDA WHEN HE RAN FOR 

379
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,689
PRESIDENT. 

380
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,423
>> IT IS THE SAME ARGUMENT THAT 

381
00:10:24,423 --> 00:10:28,961
STACEY ABRAMS  WAS MAKING TO 

382
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,494
THE NORTH OF GEORGIA. 

383
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:30,463
IF YOU COULD BRING OUT THE 

384
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,030
DEMOCRATS YOU COULD WIN A 

385
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,430
STATEWIDE RACE. 

386
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,198
WE WILL SEE THAT HAPPENS IN 

387
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:32,464
FLORIDA. 

388
00:10:32,464 --> 00:10:34,099
THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS 

389
00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:35,201
-- TODAY IS THE LAST DAY OF 

390
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:36,101
VOTING IN FLORIDA. 

391
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:36,802
NEARLY 2 MILLION BALLOTS HAVE 

392
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:41,707
BEEN CAST AS OF YESTERDAY, 

393
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,209
WHICH IS A HUGE SOME, AND MORE 

394
00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:46,312
THAN USUAL, RIGHT? 

395
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,382
>> NO, WE ARE SEEING A LEVEL OF 

396
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:53,619
EXCITEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

397
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,019
RECORD-BREAKING. 

398
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:54,753
I KNOW THAT IN A NUMBER OF 

399
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:56,188
COUNTIES THAT I LOOKED AT 

400
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,690
BEFORE COMING ON, THEY'RE 

401
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,257
SETTING RECORD TURNOUT. 

402
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,524
I WILL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, 

403
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,860
MIAMI-DADE. I LOOKED AT THOSE 

404
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:07,032
NUMBERS, YOU KNOW -- THE VOTE 

405
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:07,699
AMONG REPUBLICANS IN MIAMI-DADE 

406
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:08,033
IS UP 31%. 

407
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,969
YOU WOUL THINK THAT IS GREAT 

408
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:10,502
FOR REPUBLICANS, UNTIL YOU 

409
00:11:10,502 --> 00:11:11,136
úREA 

410
00:11:11,136 --> 00:11:15,741
VOTE FROM FOUR YEARS AGO WAS UP 

411
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:15,941
71%. 

412
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:16,675
YOU ARE SEEING EXCITEMENT ON 

413
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,243
BOTH SIDES. 

414
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,778
THE NOTION OF SUPPRESSING A 

415
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,146
REPUBLICAN VOTE, OR NOT BEEN 

416
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:25,251
ABLE TO GET -- LOOK, THERE IS 

417
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,285
GOING TO BE -- THIS IS GOING TO 

418
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:26,952
BE A MAJOR ELECTION IN 

419
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:27,219
NOVEMBER. 

420
00:11:27,219 --> 00:11:28,654
I HAVE HEARD ONE OF YOUR GUESTS 

421
00:11:28,654 --> 00:11:29,388
EARLIER TALK ABOUT THIS BEING 

422
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:30,022
THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL MIDTERM 

423
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,589
ELECTION IN HIS LIFETIME. 

424
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:37,396
I THINK I FEEL THE SAME WAY. 

425
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:38,297
THERE IS A LOT AT STAKE. 

426
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,231
I THINK THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD 

427
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:40,166
LOWER VOTERS INTO NOT TURNING 

428
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:40,599
OUT IS A MISTAKE. 

429
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:41,600
IT WILL BE A HIGH TURNOUT 

430
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:41,866
ELECTION. 

431
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:42,467
JUST LIKE IN PRESIDENTIAL 

432
00:11:42,467 --> 00:11:43,168
ELECTIONS, IT WILL COME DOWN TO 

433
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:45,104
A RAZOR THIN MARGIN IN 

434
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:45,371
NOVEMBER. 

435
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,538
>> LET'S TURN TO THE SENATE 

436
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:51,010
RACE, RICK SCOTT HAS EASILY WON 

437
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,911
HIS PARTY PRIMARY, SETTING THE 

438
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:52,545
STAGE FOR A HIGHLY ANTICIPATED 

439
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,579
RACE AGAINST INCUMBENT 

440
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,080
DEMOCRAT, SENATOR BILL NELSON. 

441
00:11:55,080 --> 00:12:00,853
HOW RARE IS IT TO CA U.S. 

442
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:05,157
SENATE OR SQUARE OFF AGAINST A 

443
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,625
SITTING GOVERNOR? 

444
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,392
>> THAT IS RARE, BUT MORE 

445
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,059
IMPORTANTLY -- RICK SCOTT HAS 

446
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,430
THE MONEY TO MAKE THIS A REALLY 

447
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:11,830
COMPETITIVE RACE. 

448
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,265
MOST OF THE EARLY POLLING HAS 

449
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,568
RICK SCOTT AHEAD. 

450
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,202
BILL NELSON, A LOT OF PEOPLE 

451
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,069
ARE WONDERINGÃWHAT KIND OF 

452
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:17,769
CAMPAIGN IS HE RUNNING? 

453
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:19,171
HIS STAFF TELLS ME THAT THEY 

454
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:25,177
ARE HOLDING THEIR POWDER. 

455
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:25,877
THEY KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT 

456
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:26,511
OUTSPEND THE REPUBLICANS, SO 

457
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:27,145
THEY ARE KEEPING THEIR MONEY 

458
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:28,614
BACK UNTIL IT REALLY COUNTS, 

459
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,114
STARTING IN SEPTEMBER. 

460
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:29,948
AND THEN IN OCTOBER THEY WILL 

461
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:30,783
BE ON THE AIR. 

462
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,483
BUT, RIGHT NOW THE GOVERNOR HAS 

463
00:12:31,483 --> 00:12:32,952
HAD TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 

464
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:39,691
OF ADS ATTACKING THE SITTING 

465
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:40,392
SENATOR, BASICALLY TRYING TO 

466
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:41,092
MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT HE IS 

467
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:41,594
TOO OLD. 

468
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,862
HE HAS CALLED HIM CONFUSED AT 

469
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:45,264
TIME. 

470
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,432
SO, YOU WILL SEE THIS TURN INTO 

471
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,266
A NASTY RACE AS WELL. 

472
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,000
IF I COULD THROW ONE OTHER 

473
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,968
THING -- I THINK THAT OVER ALL 

474
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,737
OF THESE RACES, YOU ARE SEEING 

475
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:52,337
THE STONEMAN DOUGLAS TRAGEDY 

476
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:52,771
PLAY OUT AS WELL. 

477
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,073
YOU WILL SEE THIS IN 

478
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,376
CONGRESSIONAL RACES, YOU ARE 

479
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,344
SEEING IT IN THE SENATE RACE. 

480
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:58,811
THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. 

481
00:12:58,811 --> 00:12:59,745
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE -- 

482
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,281
IN BROWARD COUNTY, NORMALLY WE 

483
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,282
DO NOT SPEND A LOT OF TIME 

484
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:03,916
LOOKING AT SCHOOL BOARD RACES 

485
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,083
NATIONALLY, BUT ONE OF THE 

486
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,518
PARENTS OF THE STONEMAN DOUGLAS 

487
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:07,786
TRAGEDY, ONE OF THE PARENTS WHO 

488
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,155
LOST A DAUGHTER WAS ELECTED TO 

489
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,224
THE SCHOOL BOARD. 

490
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,025
SHE IS A POLITICAL NEOPHYTE, 

491
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,093
NEVER HAD ANY EXPERIENCE 

492
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,961
WHATSOEVER. 

493
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,995
SHE RAN, SHE NOW WILL SERVE ON 

494
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:17,429
THE SCHOOL BOARD. 

495
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:18,497
IT IS A NEW DAY AND THIS IS 

496
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:19,398
GOING TO BE AN INTERESTING 

497
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,034
ISSUE AND A LOT OF RACES AT THE 

498
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,002
LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL 

499
00:13:24,002 --> 00:13:24,269
LEVEL. 

500
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:29,008
>> JIM, THANKS VERY MUCH FOR 

501
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,476
YOUR ANALYSIS AND INSIGHT. 

502
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,244
>> ANYTIME. 

503
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:37,816
>> LET'S TURN TO OUR PANEL. 

504
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:38,450
WAS TALK ABOUT WHAT WE JUST 

505
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:38,683
HEARD. 

506
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:39,418
AND, IT WAS INTERESTING -- YOU 

507
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,087
KNOW, THE FACT THAT BILL NELSON 

508
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:42,921
DOESN'T HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF 

509
00:13:42,921 --> 00:13:44,456
NAME RECOGNITION, CAN WE TALK 

510
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,223
ABOUT THAT? 

511
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:46,058
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD 

512
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:46,826
APPEAR TO BE SOMETHING OF A 

513
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:51,263
LITTLE BIT OF A MYSTERY. 

514
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:51,997
>> WELL, IT SPEAKS TO FLORIDA. 

515
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,697
REMEMBER, THIS IS A TRANSIENT 

516
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,032
STATE WHERE YOU HAVE RETIREES 

517
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:57,770
CYCLING THROUGH EVERY FEW 

518
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,003
YEARS. 

519
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:58,971
WHEN YOU ARE ON THE BALLOT ONCE 

520
00:13:58,971 --> 00:13:59,538
EVERY SIX YEARS, THERE IS 

521
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,673
INEVITABLY GOING TO BE CHURNED 

522
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:02,675
IN A STATE WHERE THEY MOVE IN, 

523
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,609
THEY DIE AND A NEW BATCH OF 

524
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:04,076
RETIREES MOVE IN. 

525
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,978
THAT IS WHAT IT IS. 

526
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:14,853
>> ED O'KEEFE -- AT IS YOUR 

527
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:15,453
PART OF THE SHOW. 

528
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:16,655
>> THE OTHER PART IS THE INFLUX 

529
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:20,459
OF PEOPLE FROM OTHER STATES. 

530
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,226
YOU HAVE A LOT OF PUERTO RICANS 

531
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:22,194
THAT HAVE MOVED INTO THE STATE. 

532
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:22,894
IF THEY REGISTER TO VOTE THEY 

533
00:14:22,894 --> 00:14:23,328
BECOME A FACTOR. 

534
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:23,795
IT IS HARD. 

535
00:14:23,795 --> 00:14:24,897
THIS IS A STATE THAT IN ONE WAY 

536
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:29,234
OR ANOTHER TOUCHES 10 MEDIA 

537
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:29,501
MARKETS. 

538
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,369
YOU HAVE TO SPEND AS MUCH AS 

539
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,203
EIGHT FIGURES IN ORDER TO 

540
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,137
ADVERTISE EFFECTIVELY IN THE 

541
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,238
STATE. 

542
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,206
AND NELSON DOES NOT HAVE THAT 

543
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:34,573
KIND OF MONEY. 

544
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:35,374
NOT IN A YEAR WHEN DEMOCRATS 

545
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,875
HAVE TO DEFEND 10 SEATS IN 10 

546
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,312
STATES THAT DONALD TRUMP ONE IN 

547
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:40,512
2016. 

548
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:45,417
THEY HAVE TO PICK AND CHOOSE. 

549
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:46,251
AS IS OFTEN THE CASE, THEY'RE 

550
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:46,952
WAITING UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT 

551
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,752
TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY 

552
00:14:47,752 --> 00:14:48,821
WANT TO THROW ALL OF THEIR 

553
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:49,488
MONEY INTO FLORIDA, OR LET BILL 

554
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:50,356
NELSON WEATHER ON THE VINE AND 

555
00:14:50,356 --> 00:14:51,356
FIGHT FOR HIMSELF . 

556
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:56,362
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT, AS A 

557
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:56,629
STRATEGY? 

558
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,263
YOU DO HAVE AN OPPONENT IN 

559
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:57,930
GOVERNOR SCOTT THAT HAS VERY 

560
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,297
DEEP POCKETS. 

561
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:02,835
WHAT ABOUT THIS NOTION THAT 

562
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:03,602
THEY MAY BE HOLDING BACK A 

563
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,470
LITTLE BIT AND TRYING TO BE 

564
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,704
STRATEGIC ABOUT HOW THEY SPEND 

565
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,037
THEIR MONEY? 

566
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:08,140
>> JUST LIKE ANDREW GILLUM, 

567
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:08,907
WHEN IT COMES TO BILL NELSON, 

568
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,442
WHEN PEOPLE COUNT HIM OUT  HE 

569
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,510
WILL TEACH PEOPLE THAT THEY 

570
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,212
DON'T KNOW HOW TO COUNT. 

571
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:20,519
I BELIEVE THAT ABOUT HIM. 

572
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,387
LOOK, I THINK ED IS RIGHT ABOUT 

573
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:22,054
THE TRANSIENT POPULATION MOVING 

574
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:22,388
IN AND OUT. 

575
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:22,921
BUT, WHAT YOU CANNOT 

576
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:24,189
UNDERESTIMATE IS THE FACT THAT 

577
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,557
PRIMARIES ARE LIKE SCRIMMAGES. 

578
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:26,458
THEY DETERMINE WHO WILL BE ON 

579
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,326
THE FIELD FOR THE BIG GAME IN 

580
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:27,793
THE GENERAL ELECTION. 

581
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,396
WHAT PLAYS YOU RUN BEFORE THE 

582
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,263
BIG GAME WILL DETERMINE WHO 

583
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:31,463
WINS. 

584
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,199
NOW, RICK SCOTT AND BILL NELSON 

585
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:34,866
HAVE TO HAVE POLICY DISCUSSIONS 

586
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:37,436
IN ORDER TO CONVINCE FOLKS TO 

587
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:37,970
VOTE FOR THEM. 

588
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:38,971
THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR OF 

589
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:41,140
FLORIDA FAILED TO ACT ON MANY 

590
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,010
FRONTS TO HELP THE PEOPLE OF 

591
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,978
FLORIDA IS GOING TO BE A 

592
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,580
LIABILITY FOR HIM IN NOVEMBER. 

593
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,415
AND HE HAS TO CONVINCE 

594
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,582
MODERATES, AS WELL AS THE 

595
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:55,687
EXTREME WING OF THE REPUBLICAN  

596
00:15:55,687 --> 00:15:56,421
TWO STEPS AWAY FROM PRESIDENT 

597
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:56,655
TRUMP. 

598
00:15:56,655 --> 00:16:00,092
THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT.  

599
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:00,993
THE FACT THAT IF ANDREW GILLUM 

600
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,627
IS THE WINNER OF THE PRIMARY 

601
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,928
FOR GOVERNOR, YOU'RE GOING TO 

602
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:08,000
HAVE  A SURGE IN BLACK AND 

603
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,734
BROWN TURNOUT FOR THE SIMPLE 

604
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:09,568
FACT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME 

605
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,202
TO THE RESCUE OF THEIR OWN. 

606
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:10,969
YOU CANNOT UNDERESTIMATE THAT. 

607
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:11,636
THE OTHER THING THAT YOU CANNOT 

608
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:12,770
UNDERESTIMATE IS THE NEWFOUND 

609
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,174
LOVE WITH YOUNG VOTERS IN 

610
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:15,808
FLORIDA THAT ARE DISAPPOINTED 

611
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,775
IN THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT 

612
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,010
THAT -- FOR FAILING TO DO 

613
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,548
SOMETHING FOR GUN VIOLENCE. 

614
00:16:23,548 --> 00:16:24,383
>> LET ME ASK LESLIE, GOVERNOR 

615
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:25,217
SCOTTÃI SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

616
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:26,451
HAS TWEETED  CONGRATULATIONS TO 

617
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:30,222
BOTH SCOTT AND RON DESANTIS.  

618
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:34,093
SO, YOU HAVE A GOVERNOR, RIGHT? 

619
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:34,960
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY IN RICK SCOTT 

620
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,928
THAT IS TRYING TO WALK A LINE. 

621
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:38,831
ON THE ONE HAND, UNDERSTAND THE 

622
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,465
POWER OF THE TRUMP EFFECT ON 

623
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:40,299
REPUBLICANS. 

624
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:40,899
ON THE OTHER, WHEN YOU'RE 

625
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,236
TALKING ABOUT A GENERAL ELECTION

626
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:44,836
, IT BECOMES A DIFFERENT 

627
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:45,737
CALCULATION, DOESN'T IT? 

628
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:49,408
SO, DO HAVE THE TWEET ALSO FROM 

629
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,108
PRESIDENT TRUMP, JUST SO THAT 

630
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:53,245
WE CAN SHOW PEOPLE YOU KNOW,  

631
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,480
HE CONGRATULATED GOVERNOR 

632
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,215
SCOTT, AND HE SAID 

633
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:56,782
CONGRATULATIONS TO GOVERNOR 

634
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,550
RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA ON HIS 

635
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,184
CONCLUSIVE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY 

636
00:16:59,184 --> 00:16:59,384
WIN. 

637
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:03,455
HE WILL BE A GREAT SENATOR. 

638
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:04,223
WHAT IS THE CALCULUS NOW FOR 

639
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:05,189
GOVERNOR SCOTT, GOING INTO 

640
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:05,490
NOVEMBER? 

641
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,127
>> YOU KNOW, THE BIG QUESTION I 

642
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:09,828
THINK -- AND, MOSTLY HIS 

643
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,863
CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES ARE TRYING 

644
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,333
TO DO THE MATH RIGHT NOW AND 

645
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,300
DETERMINE IF THEY CAN PICK UP 

646
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,700
THOSE MODERATES. 

647
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,734
CAN THEY PICK UP THOSE ETHNIC 

648
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:18,002
MINORITY VOTERS THAT TEND TO BE 

649
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:22,574
MORE CONSERVATIVE THAT WOULD GO 

650
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,308
AND GET THAT BASE TRUMP SUPPORT 

651
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:23,575
AS WELL? 

652
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,442
AND I THINK THAT ANY CANDIDATE 

653
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:26,044
THAT HAS NOT WHOLEHEARTEDLY 

654
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:26,845
EMBRACE THE PRESIDENT, 

655
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,413
ESPECIALLY NOW, ON THE 

656
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:29,982
REPUBLICAN SIDE, IS GOING TO 

657
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,218
REALLY BE IN A DIFFICULT 

658
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,219
SITUATION, BECAUSE THE ONES WHO 

659
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:40,058
HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT FULL 

660
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:40,959
BEARHUG ARE THE ONES THAT ARE 

661
00:17:40,959 --> 00:17:41,259
PREVAILING. 

662
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:42,094
AND FLORIDA WILL BE JUST LIKE 

663
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:42,527
EVERY OTHER STATE. 

664
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:43,695
>> IN THE PRIMARY -- 

665
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,831
>> YES, BUT AS MUCH IS THE 

666
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:50,902
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL  GALVANIZE 

667
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:51,904
HIS BASE TO REALLY GET OUT 

668
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,404
THERE AND MAKE THIS 

669
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,038
COMPETITIVE, THOSE VOTERS ARE 

670
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:53,672
GOING TO TURN OUT FOR SCOTT. 

671
00:17:53,672 --> 00:18:00,912
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP  REPORTEDLY 

672
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:01,547
CALLED THE ELECTIONS A 

673
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:01,980
REFERENDUM ON HIM. 

674
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,681
HE WARNED THAT IF THE GOP 

675
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,582
LOSES, THERE WILL BE VIOLENCE. 

676
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:04,383
ED, YOU SPOKE TO A GROUP OF 

677
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,050
VOTERS LAST NIGHT ABOUT THEIR 

678
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:05,284
ISSUES. 

679
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:12,724
I WANT TO PLAY SOME OF THAT. 

680
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:13,358
>> IMMIGRATION, HEALTHCARE, AND 

681
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:13,692
THE ECONOMY. 

682
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,860
THOSE ARE MY TOP THREE. 

683
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,863
>> IMMIGRATION, WE NEED TO KEEP 

684
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,432
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, AND 

685
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,200
POSSIBLY EVEN INCREASE THE 

686
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,035
NUMBERS IN BOTH HOUSES OF 

687
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:26,038
CONGRESS SO THAT TRUMP CAN GET 

688
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:26,638
HIS AGENDA PUSHED THROUGH. 

689
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,006
>> MORE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS 

690
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:30,408
WOULD HELP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. 

691
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:33,612
>> WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE 

692
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,981
DRIVING YOU TO THE POLLS? 

693
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,617
>> THE SILLY TALK BY THE 

694
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,517
DEMOCRATS OF IMPEACHING THE 

695
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:42,821
PRESIDENT. 

696
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:43,589
>> SO YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE 

697
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:43,889
PRESIDENT? 

698
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:45,090
IT IS PROTECTING THE PRESIDENT 

699
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,290
THEN? 

700
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,291
>> THAT IS SOMETHING VERY 

701
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,159
IMPORTANT AND I WANT THE 

702
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:47,759
ECONOMY TO CONTINUE THE WAY 

703
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,094
THAT IT IS GOING. 

704
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:52,464
I THINK WITH MORE REPUBLICANS 

705
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,198
IN CONGRESS, THE PRESIDENT WILL 

706
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:54,599
BE ABLE TO PASS HIS AGENDA MORE 

707
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,301
FREELY. 

708
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,637
>> ARE YOU PLANNING TO VOTE? 

709
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,038
WHAT IS THE MAIN REASON WHY? 

710
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,976
>> THE MAIN REASON WHY? 

711
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,143
JUST TO VOTE DEMOCRAT. 

712
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:09,815
I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY IT 

713
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:16,788
HAS SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT. WE DO 

714
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,623
NOT HAVE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, 

715
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:18,490
WE DON'T HAVE CONGRESS, AND WE 

716
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,524
DON'T HAVE THE COURTS. 

717
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:23,929
AND THE CHECKS AND BALANCES IS 

718
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,766
SKEWED ONE WAY. 

719
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:28,900
>> SO, HOW DOES THIS BECOME A 

720
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,968
REFERENDUM ON PRESIDENT TRUMP?  

721
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:34,373
>> I WILL TELL YOU, IN MY 

722
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,674
TRAVELS TO FLORIDA, ARIZONA, 

723
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:39,177
OHIO, VERMONT -- HE COMES UP 

724
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:39,477
UNPROMPTED. 

725
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:40,145
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ANYMORE. 

726
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,580
THE VOTERS ARE BRINGING IT UP 

727
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,381
FOR YOU. 

728
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:42,948
SO, WHETHER REPUBLICANS AND 

729
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,616
DEMOCRATS LIKE IT, HE IS GOING 

730
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:45,183
TO BE AN ISSUE. 

731
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,184
HE IS GOING TO BE ON THE 

732
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:50,388
BALLOT, WHICH IS WHY THE RACES 

733
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:51,223
IN FLORIDA FOR GOVERNOR AND 

734
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:51,890
SENATE COULD BE INTERESTING, 

735
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,962
SINCE HE IS SO CLOSELY ALIGNED 

736
00:19:56,962 --> 00:19:57,729
WITH BOTH OF THE GOP NOMINEES 

737
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:57,962
THERE. 

738
00:19:57,962 --> 00:19:58,363
IT WAS TELLING. 

739
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,030
WE WILL TALK TONIGHT AND WE 

740
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,998
WILL HEAR TALK IN THE COMING 

741
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:00,832
WEEKS ABOUT GUNS IN FLORIDA, 

742
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,399
ESPECIALLY SOUTH FLORIDA. 

743
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:06,972
THERE WAS A GATHERING OF FOLKS 

744
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:07,339
OUTSIDE MIAMI. 

745
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:07,939
I ASKED THEM ABOUT PARKLAND, 

746
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:08,573
WHICH HAD HAPPENED ABOUT ONE 

747
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:09,407
HOUR NORTH AND WHETHER OR NOT 

748
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:10,074
IT WOULD BE AN ISSUE. 

749
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:11,375
TO A PERSON, THE DEMOCRATS SAID 

750
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,577
NO, WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE 

751
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:15,480
THIS MOVING THE NEEDLE AT ALL 

752
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,785
IN TERMS OF THOSE STUDENTS FROM 

753
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,419
PARKLAND TRAVELING THE COUNTRY 

754
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,386
TRYING TO MAKE IT AN ISSUE. 

755
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,654
BE THAT IS DISPROVEN IN THE 

756
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,991
RESULTS IF ANDREW GILLUM 

757
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:26,858
PREVAILS AND WE FIND OUT THAT 

758
00:20:26,858 --> 00:20:27,559
PEOPLE SHOWED UP IN PART 

759
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,527
BECAUSE OF HIS  OPPOSITION TO 

760
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,962
STAND YOUR GROUND AND THE STATES

761
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:31,763
GUN CONTROL POLICY. 

762
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:37,702
BUT IT WAS TELLING THAT ISSUE 

763
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:38,336
WAS DISMISSED, BUT IMMIGRATIN, 

764
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,171
WHETHER OR NOT TO IMPEACH THE 

765
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:40,138
PRESIDENT OR PROTECT THE 

766
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,606
PRESIDENT, AND THE ECONOMY 

767
00:20:41,606 --> 00:20:42,274
CERTAINLY ON THE MINDS OF 

768
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,308
VOTERS DOWN THERE. 

769
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,110
>> YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER HOW 

770
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,778
MUCH THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO 

771
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:51,049
BE ACTIVE. JUST LAST WEEK WE 

772
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:51,817
WERE SPEAKING WITH WHITE HOUSE 

773
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:52,350
OFFICIALS THAT SAID THIS 

774
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,118
PRESIDENT WANTS TO BE MORE 

775
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:53,819
ACTIVE THAN OBAMA WAS, LAST 

776
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:54,286
TIME AROUND HE LOVES 

777
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:59,191
CAMPAIGNING, WE KNOW THAT HE 

778
00:20:59,191 --> 00:20:59,891
RELISHES THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO 

779
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:00,625
OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND 

780
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:05,263
MOSTLY DEFEND HIMSELF AND THE 

781
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:06,064
IN FRONT OF WELCOMING CROWDS 

782
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:06,798
AND TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT HE 

783
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,468
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT, WHICH 

784
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,503
MIGHT NOT BE THINGS THAT MOST 

785
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:12,137
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WANT TO 

786
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:12,938
TALK ABOUT, BUT HE WILL BE 

787
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,171
ACTIVE. 

788
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,172
THAT GIVES REPUBLICANS AN 

789
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:15,340
OPPORTUNITY TO RALLY THEIR 

790
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,109
BASE, BUT COMES WITH THE RISK 

791
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:23,548
OF DOING MORE TO RALLY UP THE 

792
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,216
OTHER SIDE IF THAT IS EVEN 

793
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:24,783
POSSIBLE AT THIS POINT. 

794
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,419
BUT, KEEP THAT IN MIND. 

795
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:28,487
HE WILL BE SPENDING A LOT OF 

796
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:29,387
TIME IN FLORIDA AS WE KNOW, HE 

797
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:30,688
VISITS THERE IN THE WINTER 

798
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:31,790
ANYWAY. HE LOVES THAT STATE, HE 

799
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,158
LOVES GOING THERE. 

800
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:36,193
HE LOVES RON DESANTIS. 

801
00:21:36,193 --> 00:21:37,262
HE IS GOING TO BE CAMPAIGNING A 

802
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:39,731
LOT, WHICH IS SOMETHING TO 

803
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,098
CONSIDER . 

804
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:43,535
>> ANTOINE, CAN WE TALK ABOUT 

805
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,402
ANDREW GILLUM A LITTLE BIT MORE 

806
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:44,603
 

807
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,270
I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING IS 

808
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:48,073
AND ÃINTERESTING. 

809
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:48,807
AFTER LISTENING TO JIM DESCRIBE 

810
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,208
THOSE THREE THINGS THAT HE SAID 

811
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,444
THAT WERE FACTORS, BERNIE 

812
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:57,015
SANDERS, THE OPPOSITION BY 

813
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:57,615
ANDREW GILLUM TO STAND YOUR 

814
00:21:57,615 --> 00:21:58,483
GROUND, AND THE FACT THAT AMONG 

815
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,985
THE NEGATIVE AS,  NONE OF THEM 

816
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,422
WERE TARGETED AT ANDREW GILLUM. 

817
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,322
THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT -- 

818
00:22:04,322 --> 00:22:04,922
WHAT IS THE PROPER APPROACH 

819
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:05,289
NATIONALLY?  

820
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:08,927
IS IT TO BE IN TUNE MORE WITH 

821
00:22:08,927 --> 00:22:09,494
THOSE PROGRESSIVE KIND OF 

822
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:09,727
IDEALS? 

823
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:12,364
IS IT TO BE MORE MODERATE? 

824
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:13,932
IS THERE A TAKE AWAY THAT CAN 

825
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:20,705
BE APPLIED,  IF IN FACT ANDREW 

826
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:21,272
GILLUM IS ABLE TO EMERGE 

827
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:22,040
VICTORIOUS, ABOUT WHAT THE 

828
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,640
PROPER APPROACH FOR DEMOCRATS 

829
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,141
NATIONWIDE SHOULD BE? 

830
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:23,808
>>  I DON'T PUT LABELS ON 

831
00:22:23,808 --> 00:22:24,643
DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE I THINK THAT 

832
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,245
YOU TAKE YELLOW DOG, BLUE DOG, 

833
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:30,015
PINK DOG. 

834
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,715
PROGRESSIVE NOT PROGRESSIVE, WE 

835
00:22:30,715 --> 00:22:33,251
ARE JUST DEMOCRATS. 

836
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,086
I HATE LABELING PEOPLE 

837
00:22:35,086 --> 00:22:35,754
UNDERNEATH THE TENT OF THE 

838
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,187
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

839
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:38,756
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE. 

840
00:22:38,756 --> 00:22:39,323
HOWEVER, YOU CANNOT 

841
00:22:39,323 --> 00:22:41,993
UNDERESTIMATE THE FACT THAT THE 

842
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,462
TYPE OF CAMPAIGN THAT HE RAN 

843
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,064
WAS HIGH-TECH AND HIGH TOUCH 

844
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:46,331
CAMPAIGN. 

845
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,133
THAT WAS PART OF THE FAILURE I 

846
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:51,002
FEEL LIKE THAT HILLARY CLINTON 

847
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:51,670
DID NOT DO IN 2016. 

848
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,638
THE FACT THAT HE HAS ACTIVATED 

849
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:54,506
PEOPLE NORMALLY NOT INVOLVED IN 

850
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,508
THE PROCESS IS VERY TELLING 

851
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,610
ABOUT THE RESULTS AND THE SURGE 

852
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,114
IN TURNOUT, PARTICULARLY AMONG 

853
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:03,815
BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS. 

854
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:04,415
I GUARANTEE YOU, WHEN WE 

855
00:23:04,415 --> 00:23:12,090
CALCULATE THE TABS, WE WILL SEE 

856
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:12,924
THAT THERE HAVE BEEN HISTORIC 

857
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,524
GAINS AMONG BLACK AND BROWN 

858
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,025
VOTERS WITHIN FLORIDA. 

859
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:14,759
>> HOW DID HE ACTIVATE THEM? 

860
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:16,861
>> HIGH-TECH AND HIGH TOUCH. 

861
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:17,362
TRADITIONAL GRASSROOTS, 

862
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,029
KNOCKING ON DOORS, FAITH-BASED 

863
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:18,463
STUFF. 

864
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:21,900
YOU KNOW, ROBO CALLS, AFRICAN-

865
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,401
AMERICAN RADIO, ETC. 

866
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,468
BUT, THE HIGH-TECH COMPONENT, 

867
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:28,073
WHETHER IT IS DIGITAL, EMAILS, 

868
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,640
ON THE AIR, TB. 

869
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,207
TEXT MESSAGING, ALL OF THE 

870
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,208
NONTRADITIONAL THINGS THAT 

871
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:33,078
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PROGRESSIVE 

872
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:33,745
CANDIDATES HAVE NOT DONE IN THE 

873
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:33,945
PAST. 

874
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:42,187
THE OTHER THING, WITH PRESIDENT 

875
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:42,854
TRUMP COMES SOME OF HIS 

876
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:43,688
FRIENDS, BUT ALL OF HIS 

877
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:43,955
ENEMIES. 

878
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:44,555
AND, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 

879
00:23:44,555 --> 00:23:45,623
THINGS THAT DRIVE OUT VOTERS IN 

880
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:48,826
ELECTIONS, FEAR, ANGER, AND 

881
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:49,160
FRUSTRATION. 

882
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,827
I THINK THOSE THINGS WILL BE A 

883
00:23:49,827 --> 00:23:50,628
BIG FACTOR FOR THE U.S. SENATE 

884
00:23:50,628 --> 00:23:51,463
RACE, AND THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 

885
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,163
IN FLORIDA AND IN OTHER PLACES 

886
00:23:52,163 --> 00:23:53,265
LIKE ARIZONA. 

887
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,101
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK, LESLIE, 

888
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:56,801
AS A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST WHEN 

889
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:57,401
YOU HEAR THAT? 

890
00:23:57,401 --> 00:23:58,670
>> CONSISTENTLY, I THINK THAT 

891
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,273
AS WE COME BACK INTO THE 

892
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,375
ASSESSMENT OF ALL THIS, THE 

893
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,409
CANDIDATES -- THESE 

894
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,677
CHARISMATIC, EVEN IN THE 

895
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,512
PRIMARIES WE SEE THE DYNAMIC 

896
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:13,518
HIGH TOUCH RETAIL POLITICIAN AND

897
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,353
FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE TALKING 

898
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,923
ABOUT FLORIDA AND THE SEATS 

899
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:21,326
THAT WERE HELD AND THAT THEY 

900
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:21,826
SHOULD BE A SHOE IN. 

901
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:24,129
WE HAD A LOT OF CANDIDATES BACK 

902
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,531
OUT DID NOT THINK THEY COULD 

903
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:26,898
RAISE MONEY. 

904
00:24:26,898 --> 00:24:27,532
PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT SHE TOOK 

905
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:28,600
MORE OF A LAZY LAID-BACK 

906
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,568
APPROACH AS IT WAS AS COMPARED 

907
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:34,439
TO THE UNIVISION ANCHOR WENT 

908
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,173
OUT THERE AND REALLY HAS BEEN 

909
00:24:35,173 --> 00:24:35,974
VERY PRESENT, DYNAMIC, AND IS 

910
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,108
REALLY GETTING A LOT OF 

911
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,810
ATTENTION. 

912
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:39,677
I THINK AS THE CARDS FALL, AND 

913
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:41,146
WE SEE THIS, IT IS GOING TO BE 

914
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:45,850
THESE INDIVIDUAL DYNAMIC, 

915
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,551
CANDIDATES THAT USE A 

916
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:47,185
COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGY AND 

917
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:47,885
RETAIL POLITICKING, TO GET PAST 

918
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:51,889
THE NOISE, BUT WE CANNOT 

919
00:24:51,889 --> 00:24:52,590
DISCOUNT THE PRESIDENTS EFFECT, 

920
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,791
THE TRUMP EFFECT OF GALVANIZING 

921
00:24:53,791 --> 00:24:55,193
AND DRAWING THE ATTENTION AND 

922
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,028
THE MONEY TO GET THEM TO THAT 

923
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,097
NEXT LEVEL. 

924
00:24:59,097 --> 00:24:59,864
>> YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING? 

925
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:01,199
>> THAT COULD BACKFIRE. 

926
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,134
>> IT WAS GOING TO BE MY 

927
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:03,400
QUESTION. 

928
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:13,444
IS THERE A ISSUE ABOUT 

929
00:25:13,444 --> 00:25:13,911
ENERGIZING DEMOCRATS? 

930
00:25:13,911 --> 00:25:14,712
>> THEY HAVE HAD TWO YEARS -- 

931
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:15,647
>> YOU THINK IT DOESN'T MATTER? 

932
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:16,514
>> EVERY DAY YOU THINK YOU 

933
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:20,018
CANNOT GET MORE EXCITED. 

934
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,852
EVEN AS REPUBLICANS WE ARE LIKE 

935
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:21,752
ÃTHIS IS NOT REALLY HAPPENING. 

936
00:25:21,752 --> 00:25:22,353
EVERYDAY PEOPLE ARE EXCITED 

937
00:25:22,353 --> 00:25:23,020
ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. 

938
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,255
THE QUESTION IS -- ARE THERE 

939
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:24,688
VIABLE CANDIDATES? 

940
00:25:24,688 --> 00:25:25,857
THOSE WERE THE LESSONS FROM 

941
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,926
LAST YEAR. 

942
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:28,526
CONFIDENT, VIABLE CANDIDATES 

943
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,593
THAT CAN REALLY HOLD OFFICE AND 

944
00:25:29,593 --> 00:25:35,867
LEAD? I THINK THAT YOU ARE 

945
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,501
STARTING TO SEE A GESTATION OF 

946
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,702
THAT BUT THERE ARE MORE ON THE 

947
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,470
RIGHT AND THE LEFT BUT IS 

948
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,104
FASCINATING IS THE PROGRESSIVE 

949
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:39,771
SIDE, THOSE CANDIDATES ARE ABLE 

950
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:41,239
TO REALLY KIND OF BECOME 

951
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:45,443
COMPETITIVE. 

952
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,177
BUT IN THESE RACES, THERE 

953
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:46,777
STATES THAT YOU NEVER WOULD 

954
00:25:46,777 --> 00:25:47,979
HAVE SEEN A PROGRESSIVE 

955
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,280
CANDIDATE WIN. 

956
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,115
>> OR, CANDIDATES THAT ARE 

957
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:54,218
HOPPING IN THE CAR, WRITING 

958
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:54,919
DOWN THIS POLITICAL ROAD WITH 

959
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:55,620
DONALD TRUMP, I WOULD CAUTION 

960
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,425
THEM, BECAUSE WE DO NOT KNOW IN 

961
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,259
THE COMING DAYS, WEEKS, OR 

962
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:01,959
MONTHS WHAT THEY MAY LOOK LIKE 

963
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:02,426
FOR THIS PRESIDENT. 

964
00:26:02,426 --> 00:26:05,496
KEEP IN MIND, HE HAS GOT SOME 

965
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:05,897
LEGAL ISSUES. 

966
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,631
HE HAS PEOPLE ALL AROUND HIM 

967
00:26:06,631 --> 00:26:07,432
WHO HAVE RUBBED UP AGAINST HIM 

968
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:08,900
IN MANY WAYS THAT COULD BE 

969
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,135
GOING DOWN FROM A LEGAL 

970
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:13,104
STANDPOINT IN THE COMING DAYS 

971
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:13,805
OR WEEKS, THAT COULD HAVE 

972
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,107
TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HIS 

973
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,142
APPROVAL, THAT COULD HAVE 

974
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,679
TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HOW THE 

975
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:21,112
PUBLIC VIEWS HIM. 

976
00:26:21,112 --> 00:26:21,713
THAT COULD HAVE TREMENDOUS 

977
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:26,818
IMPACT ON HOW HE IS ABLE TO 

978
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:27,518
GARNER SUPPORT AMONG THE BASE 

979
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:28,352
AND BRING BACK OUT THE VOTERS 

980
00:26:28,352 --> 00:26:29,921
WHO VOTED FOR HIM IN THE 2016 

981
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,388
ELECTION AS WELL AS CONVINCE 

982
00:26:31,388 --> 00:26:36,695
PEOPLE TO NOT VOTE AGAINST HIM 

983
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,095
IN THE MIDTERMS.

984
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:37,696
>> CAITLIN, HAVEN'T WE SEEN 

985
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,331
THOUGH THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT 

986
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:40,565
REMAIN ROCKSOLID AMONG THAT 40% 

987
00:26:40,565 --> 00:26:41,332
OF VOTERS? 

988
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:42,033
FOR OTHER PEOPLE, WHO ARE 

989
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:48,106
LOOKING AT THE RUSSIA 

990
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,040
SITUATION, AND A LOT OF FOLKS 

991
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,275
DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF IT 

992
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,310
YET, THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTUAL 

993
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,311
CONCLUSION BY ROBERT MUELLER. 

994
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:54,245
>> THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SEEN THE 

995
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:59,150
PRESIDENT CREATE HIS OWN MESSAGE

996
00:26:59,150 --> 00:26:59,750
AROUND THIS MUELLER PROBE, 

997
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,418
TRYING TO WIN THE PUBLIC 

998
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:01,619
RELATIONS BATTLE AND INFLUENCE 

999
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:02,019
PUBLIC OPINION. 

1000
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:02,754
THAT IS BEFORE ANYTHING 

1001
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:03,988
ACTUALLY COMES OUT OF IT IN 

1002
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:08,092
TERMS OF THE RELATION TO HIM. 

1003
00:27:08,092 --> 00:27:08,759
I THINK WHAT IS REALLY 

1004
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:09,994
INTERESTING HERE IS THAT YOU 

1005
00:27:09,994 --> 00:27:14,432
KNOW, THE MAP IS NOT THE SAME 

1006
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:14,732
EVERYWHERE. 

1007
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:17,736
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPETITIVE 

1008
00:27:17,736 --> 00:27:18,470
HOUSE RACES FOR DEMOCRATS, BUT 

1009
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,738
WE HAVE A LOT OF COMPETITIVE 

1010
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,638
SENATE RACES FOR REPUBLICANS. 

1011
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:25,043
NOW, THE HOUSES WHERE THE 

1012
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:25,677
CONCERNS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT LIE 

1013
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:25,977
OF COURSE. 

1014
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,345
SO, THAT IS REALLY THE BIG KIND 

1015
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:29,047
OF KEY ISSUE HERE AND ALONG 

1016
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:31,416
WITH THAT TURNOVER COMES ALL 

1017
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:38,256
THE TURNOVER OF CHAIRMANÃ

1018
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:38,823
CHAIRMANSHIPS AND THE INNER 

1019
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:39,691
WORKINGS OF CONGRESS AND WE 

1020
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:40,191
HAVE SEEN THAT BEFORE. 

1021
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:40,858
ON THE SENATE SIDE, REPUBLICANS 

1022
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:42,027
ARE VERY HAPPY WITH WHAT THEIR 

1023
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:45,629
PROSPECTS LOOK LIKE, TAKING 

1024
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:46,330
OVER SOME OF THESE SENATE 

1025
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,632
RACES, ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE 

1026
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:51,636
TALKING ABOUT JUDGES. 

1027
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:52,370
THE SENATE CONFIRMING JUDGES AT 

1028
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:52,937
A NEAR RECORD PACE. 

1029
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:56,240
A NEAR RECORD AMOUNT OF FEDERAL 

1030
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,741
JUDGESHIPS STILL OPEN. 

1031
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,111
SO, THESE ARE SOME OF THE KINDS 

1032
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,747
OF THINGS. 

1033
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:03,414
YOU KNOW, YOU WILL SEE 

1034
00:28:03,414 --> 00:28:04,182
REPUBLICANS ON THE HOUSE SIDE 

1035
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,183
TRY TO LOCALIZE THEIR RACES, ON 

1036
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,386
THE SENATE SIDE THERE VERY MUCH 

1037
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,053
TRYING TO NATIONALIZE THESE 

1038
00:28:09,053 --> 00:28:09,754
RACES AND HITCH THEMSELVES TO 

1039
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,055

1041
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,892
>> WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED, 

1042
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:15,960
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AS

OKAY, IT IS A PROJECTION WITH 

1069
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:44,535
ANDREW GILLUM EMERGING THE 

1070
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,536

BACK TO THAT LIFE SHOT IN 

1073
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,879
TALLAHASSEE, WHERE WE SPEAK TO 

1074
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:55,346
OUR PANEL HERE. 

1075
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,180
ANTOINE, LET ME START WITH YOU. 

1076
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,847
WE HAD SPOKEN LAST SEGMENT 

1077
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:59,784
ABOUT THE NOTION THAT THERE 

1078
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:00,484
WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT PUSHED 

1079
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:01,486
ANDREW GILLUM  TOWARDS THE 

1080
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:04,589
FRONT THAT PEOPLE MAYBE DID NOT 

1081
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:05,022
EVEN SEE COMING. 

1082
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:10,094
BUT, IN YOUR VIEW, YOU THINK IT 

1083
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:10,661
WAS HIS COMBINATION OF OLD-

1084
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:11,562
FASHIONED SHOE LEATHER, RETAIL 

1085
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,765
POLITICS, WITH A HIGH-TECH 

1086
00:32:14,765 --> 00:32:15,333
APPROACH THAT HAS NOT 

1087
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:15,967
NECESSARILY BEEN TAKEN BEFORE 

1088
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,135
BY A CANDIDATE LIKE HIM? 

1089
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:18,436
>> IT WAS A REMIX VERSION. 

1090
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,004
LET ME SAY TO ENTER, I'M TRYING 

1091
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:23,007
NOT TO BE EMOTIONAL, BUT IT IS A

1092
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:23,440
HISTORIC NIGHT. 

1093
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,143
THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY 

1094
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,479
OF FLORIDA THAT A AFRICAN-

1095
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:29,180
AMERICAN WILL BE THE DEMOCRATIC 

1096
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,647
NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR. 

1097
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:30,681
SO, NOW FOR DEMOCRATS WE HAVE 

1098
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:31,783
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT THE 

1099
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,284

1100
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:36,921

1117

1118
00:33:00,877 --> 00:33:02,212
THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEFORE FOR 

1119

1122
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,454
HILLARY CLINTON LOST IN 16, 

1123
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:10,888
WHERE DEMOCRATS UNDERPERFORMED, 

1124

THOSE VOTER NUMBERS ARE UP. 

1125

1127
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,032
VOTER REGISTRATION. 

1128
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:21,566
AND ALL THAT MAKES A 

1129
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:21,899
DIFFERENCE. 

1130
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,134
BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES. 

1131
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:23,801
THOSE MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. 

1132
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:29,240
PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW HOW IT 

1133
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,707
IMPACTS THEIR WALLET. 

1134
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,374
THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW IT IS 

1135
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:31,242
GOING TO IMPACT THEIR QUALITY 

1136
00:33:31,242 --> 00:33:31,576

1137
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:32,844
HE SPENT HIS TIME TALKING ABOUT 

1138
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,478
THOSE ISSUES WHILE EVERYONE 

1139
00:33:34,478 --> 00:33:35,947

1140

HE FOCUSED ON DOING STEP ONE 

1142

1143
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:41,585

1144

IF YOU CANNOT GET TO STEP ONE 

1151
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:51,395
YOU CANNOT GET TO STEP TWO TO 

1152
00:33:51,395 --> 00:33:52,196

00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,812
AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL 

1283
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:13,784
UNIVERSITY. 

1284
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:16,220
I CAN'T -- [ CHEERING ] 

1285
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:21,659
>> I CANNOT THANK, I CAN'T THANK

1286
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:26,464
ENOUGH MY FLORIDA A AND M 

1287
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,032
UNIVERSITY FAMILY THAT HAVE 

1288
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,001
HELD ME UP THROUGHOUT THIS RACE.

1289
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,304
BUT, I ALSO CANNOT HESITATE TO 

1290
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:37,675
THINK THOSE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT 

1291
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:44,215
KNOW ME FROM ADAM WHO, AS I 

1292
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:44,882
TRAVELED AROUND THE STATE, THEY 

1293
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,884
TOOK HOLD OF OUR VISION AND OUR 

1294
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,253
MISSION, AND OUR PLANS FOR A 

1295
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,955
STATE THAT MAKES ROOM FOR ALL 

1296
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:52,223
OF US. 

1297
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,492
NOT JUST THE WELL-CONNECTED, 

1298
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:57,695
BUT ALL OF US. 

1299
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,164
AND I SINCERELY BELIEVE THAT 

1300
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,331
WHAT IS GOING TO DELIVER US TO 

1301
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:03,033
VICTORY IN NOVEMBER IS THE FACT 

1302
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:06,503
THAT THERE ARE EVERYDAY HARD-

1303
00:40:06,503 --> 00:40:07,705
WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS STATE 

1304
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:16,647
WHO BELIEVE, WHO BELIEVE -- 

1305
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,715
THAT THEY DESERVE A VOICE IN 

1306
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,349
OUR GOVERNMENT TO, AND WE ARE 

1307
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,316
GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM. 

1308
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:24,288
WE ARE GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM.

1309
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,222
THE POINT HAS NEVER BEEN LOST 

1310
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,456
ON ME THAT MY NAME ON THE 

1311
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:28,492
BALLOT IS SIMPLY A VESSEL. 

1312
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:32,930
IT IS SIMPLY THE NAME, BUT WHAT 

1313
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,299
IS UNDERNEATH THAT NAME ALL THE 

1314
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:36,533
ISSUES THAT WE CARE SO DEEPLY 

1315
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:37,201
ABOUT. 

1316
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:41,005
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME IS THE 

1317
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,139
BELIEF THAT WE OUGHT TO PAY 

1318
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:45,142
TEACHERS WHAT THEY ARE WORTH 

1319
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:45,775
FOR DOING THE MOST DIFFICULT 

1320
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:47,011
JOB THAT EXISTS ON EARTH. 

1321
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:50,080
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME IS OUR 

1322
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:57,254
BELIEF THAT OUR PUBLIC 

1323
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:57,988
EDUCATION SYSTEM AND OUR PUBLIC 

1324
00:40:57,988 --> 00:40:58,855
TAX DOLLARS ARE TO BE USED FOR 

1325
00:40:58,855 --> 00:40:59,990
THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM, TO 

1326
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:00,390
EDUCATE ALL KIDS. 

1327
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:05,262
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME -- WHAT 

1328
00:41:05,262 --> 00:41:05,896
IS BEHIND AND BENEATH MY NAME 

1329
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,899
IS A BELIEF, A VERY DEEP AND 

1330
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,467
PASSIONATE BELIEF THAT ANYBODY 

1331
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:13,237
WHO WORKS A FULL-TIME JOB, WHO 

1332
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:17,641
GETS UP EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK 

1333
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:21,745
WHO SPENDS 40 HOURS FULL-TIME 

1334
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:25,015
GIVING THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIFE

1335
00:41:25,015 --> 00:41:25,816
TO THEIR PROFESSION INTO THEIR 

1336
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,719
WORK, IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THEY 

1337
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:29,886
 

1338
00:41:29,886 --> 00:41:32,556
CAN LIVE ON AND NOT BE PAID 

1339
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:41,465
POVERTY WAGES AS THEY SERVICE 

1340
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:42,165
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. 

1341
00:41:42,165 --> 00:41:43,133
WHAT I ALSO BELIEVE IS THAT 

1342
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:44,033
FOLKS OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO WORK 

1343
00:41:44,033 --> 00:41:44,935
ONE JOB, NOT 2-3, BUT ONE FULL-

1344
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,503
TIME JOB AS A WAY TO MAKE ENDS 

1345
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:47,338
MEET. 

1346
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,172
WHAT IS B■ENEATH MY NAME? 

1347
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:52,676
THE BELIEF THAT WE DESERVE A 

1348
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,343
GOVERNOR WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES 

1349
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:55,145
IN THE SCIENCE. 

1350
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:59,450
[ CHEERING ] ACTUALLY BELIEVES  

1351
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:04,688
WHO IS GOING TO TAKE BACK 

1352
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,956
CONTROL OF OUR DEPARTMENT OF 

1353
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,391
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND 

1354
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:11,629
MAKE IT MEAN SOMETHING AGAIN. 

1355
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,463
WERE WE HAVE CLEAN AIR TO 

1356
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:15,566
BREATHE, CLEAN WATER TO DRINK, 

1357
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:21,305
OUR OCEANS -- THAT ARE NOT 

1358
00:42:21,305 --> 00:42:22,006
CONTAMINATED WITH RED TIDE AND 

1359
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:22,973
BLUE-GREEN ALGAE SUFFOCATING 

1360
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,743
OUR SEA LIFE. 

1361
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:26,944
THERE IS NOT A PROFIT MARGIN IN 

1362
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:27,611
THE STATE OF FLORIDA THAT OUGHT 

1363
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:28,678
TO BE ABLE TO ROB US OF THOSE 

1364
00:42:28,678 --> 00:42:29,947
ELEMENTS OF CLEAN WATER, CLEAN 

1365
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,483
AIR, AND GOOD OCEANS. 

1366
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,885
WHAT IS BENEATH MY NAME -- A 

1367
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:38,255
BELIEF THAT WE HAVE TO TREAT 

1368
00:42:38,255 --> 00:42:39,390
HEALTHCARE LIKE A RIGHT, AND 

1369
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,424
NOT A PRIVILEGE. 

1370
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,959
I BELIEVE THAT. 

1371
00:42:42,959 --> 00:42:45,162
AND IT BEGINS BY EXPANDING 

1372
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:49,600
MEDICAID FOR OVER 700,000 OF 

1373
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,701
THE MOST MEDICALLY NEEDY PEOPLE 

1374
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:51,135
IN THIS STATE. 

1375
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,469
YOU CAN ALSO REST ASSURED THAT 

1376
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:55,105
WHEN I AM GOVERNOR OF THE STATE 

1377
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,674
OF FLORIDA, IF THE PRESIDENT 

1378
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,943
DECIDES TO SEND US $2.4 BILLION 

1379
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:04,715
TO BUILD A HIGH-SPEED RAIL 

1380
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,616
ACROSS THE QUARTER, WE ARE 

1381
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:06,283
GOING TO BRING THAT MONEY RIGHT 

1382
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,717
HERE TO THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

1383
00:43:07,717 --> 00:43:10,487
RIGHT? 

1384
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,256
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS THAT THESE 

1385
00:43:13,256 --> 00:43:14,657
ARE NOT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT 

1386
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:20,898
ISSUES -- THE JOB OF THE 

1387
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:21,598
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF 

1388
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:22,566
FLORIDA IS TO DO WHAT IS IN THE 

1389
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:23,434
BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE OF 

1390
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,036
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

1391
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,104
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING THAT 

1392
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:31,675
GUY FOR YOU, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

1393
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:32,543
BENEATH MY NAME IS ALSO A 

1394
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,243
DESIRE BY THE MAJORITY OF 

1395
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,945
PEOPLE IN THIS STATE TO SEE 

1396
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,080
REAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM 

1397
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,414
TAKE HOLD IN THE STATE OF 

1398
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,683
FLORIDA. 

1399
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,251
THE KIND OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE 

1400
00:43:41,251 --> 00:43:44,388
REFORM THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO 

1401
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:50,160
MAKE A MISTAKE TO BE ABLE TO 

1402
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,760
REDEEM THEMSELVES FROM THAT 

1403
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,361
MISTAKE, RETURN TO SOCIETY, 

1404
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:51,995
HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE, BUT 

1405
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,230
ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO WORK. 

1406
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,667
A GOOD WAGE. 

1407
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:03,040
THIS IS -- NOT MY MOMENT, THIS 

1408
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,308
IS OUR MOMENT. 

1409
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,111
THIS IS OUR MOMENT. 

1410
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:09,846
WE COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY WERE 

1411
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:13,150
IT NOT FOR THE STRUGGLE, THE 

1412
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,853
CONTRIBUTIONS, THE HARD WORK, 

1413
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:16,854
THE ORGANIZING, THE SELF 

1414
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:21,291
ORGANIZING WHEN WE WENT INTO 

1415
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:22,091
PLACES AND WE DID NOT HAVE 

1416
00:44:22,091 --> 00:44:23,060
FLYERS TO HAND OUT THAT I WENT 

1417
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,596
BACK A WEEK LATER AND THEY HAD 

1418
00:44:25,596 --> 00:44:26,163
MADE THEIR OWN FLYERS. 

1419
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:26,897
RIGHT? 

1420
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:30,134
THE PLACES -- THE PLACES WHERE 

1421
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:34,304
WE HAD NO VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION

1422
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,773
BUT PEOPLE BEGAN TO SELF 

1423
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:43,180
ORGANIZE AND VOLUNTEER. 

1424
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,214
WE ARE IN THIS PLACE BECAUSE OF 

1425
00:44:44,214 --> 00:44:44,814
THE EVERYDAY PEOPLE OF THIS 

1426
00:44:44,814 --> 00:44:45,048
STATE. 

1427
00:44:45,048 --> 00:44:45,648
AND I CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER 

1428
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:46,416
WITHOUT AT LEAST ACKNOWLEDGING 

1429
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:49,186
THAT I AM HERE BECAUSE I AM 

1430
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,822
PROPPED UP ON MY LEFT AND MY 

1431
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:54,591
RIGHT SIDE. 

1432
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:58,429
THERE THE WIND BENEATH MY WINGS.

1433
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:04,802
THE WOMAN -- THE WOMAN WHO 

1434
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:06,270
MAKES ME SMILE JUST A LITTLE 

1435
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:11,542
BIT WIDER. 

1436
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,277
THE WOMAN WHO, IN MY ABSENCE 

1437
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:17,147
HAS BEEN AN AMAZING MOTHER AND 

1438
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:21,651
AN AMAZING PARTNER AND SHE IS 

1439
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:22,485
GOING TO BE AN AMAZING FIRST 

1440
00:45:22,485 --> 00:45:24,154
LADY FOR THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

1441
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:29,126
MY WIFE -- I LOVE YOU HONEY. 

1442
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:35,933
I LOVE YOU BABY. 

1443
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:42,772
WE -- WE TOGETHER, WE TOGETHER, 

1444
00:45:42,772 --> 00:45:46,476
WITH ALL OF YOU, OVER THE NEXT 

1445
00:45:46,476 --> 00:45:49,746
SEVERAL MONTHS ARE GOING TO 

1446
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:50,480
MAKE OUR WAY ALL ACROSS THE 

1447
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,183
STATE OF FLORIDA TO READ 

1448
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,686
COUNTIES, TWO BLUE COUNTIES, 

1449
00:45:55,686 --> 00:46:02,459
TUBER -- PURPLE COUNTIES, AND 

1450
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:03,193
WE ARE GOING TO UNITE THIS 

1451
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:03,861
STATE IN WAYS THAT ARE 

1452
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,595
UNPARALLELED IN THE HISTORY OF 

1453
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,262
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

1454
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,596
WE ARE GOING TO BRING PEOPLE 

1455
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:09,132
TOGETHER, NOT THROUGH 

1456
00:46:09,132 --> 00:46:14,104
SUPERFICIAL DIFFERENCES, RACE, 

1457
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:14,771
COLOR, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, WHO 

1458
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:18,742
WE CHOOSE TO LOVE, RIGHT? 

1459
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:19,843
THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO BE OUR 

1460
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:20,243

BRING IT HOME FOR THE BOY DOWN 

1517
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:33,744

1518
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,144

AND AS I HAVE SAID TIME AND 

1527
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:49,992
TIME AGAIN, I DID NOT ALWAYS 

1528
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:50,794
KNOW WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER WAS 

1529
00:48:50,794 --> 00:48:51,261
COMMUNICATING TO ME. 

1530
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,062
BUT I WOULD COME TO LEARN THAT 

1531
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:53,196

1532
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,298

1534

BROTHER AND YOUR SISTER, IT IS 

1535

THERE WAS A BELIEF THAT IF I 

1539
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,109
WENT FAR IN LIFE, WE WOULD ALL 

1540
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,077
GO FAR IN LIFE.

00:49:11,881 --> 00:49:12,716
WELL, FLORIDA YOU KNOW WHAT? 

1544
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:13,849

1546
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:16,820
COLLECTIVISM BACK TO THE STATE 

1547
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,188

TO PRAY FOR SOMEBODY ELSE'S 

1553
00:49:29,332 --> 00:49:31,401
DEFEAT OR DEMISE, BUT FOR US TO 

1554
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:32,668

CREATE A VOTE THAT ALL OF US  

1556
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:38,341

1557
00:49:38,341 --> 00:49:39,142
THAT A RISING TIDE DOES LIFT 

1558
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:39,576

GILLUM'S CAMPAIGN  AND IT 

1640
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:09,252
úINCL 

1641
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:11,655
HIM. 

1642
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:13,255
LET'S LISTEN -- IS HE SPEAKING 

1643
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:15,325
AGAIN? 

1644
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,994
>> MY LOVING WIFE, MY THREE 

1645
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:21,397
KIDS, MY MOTHER, MY MOTHER-IN-

1646
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:24,935
LAW, MY BROTHERS AND MY SISTER, 

1647
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:27,871
ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU, AND ON 

1648
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,040
BEHALF OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF  

1649
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,875
THIS NOMINATION AND LOOK FORWARD

1650
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:35,812
TO NOVEMBER 6, WHEN I AM ELECTED

1651
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:38,982
THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT 

1652
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:40,884
STATE OF FLORIDA. 

1653
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,152
GOD BLESS YOU, LET'S BRING IT 

1654
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,521
HOME. 

1655
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,691
>> OKAY, AND NOW WE BELIEVE 

1656
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:49,392
THAT HE HAS CONCLUDED HIS 

1657
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:49,759
VICTORY SPEECH. 

1658
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,060
BUT, ANDREW GILLUM IN HIS QUEST 

1659
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,295
TO BECOME GOVERNOR, IF ELECTED 

1660
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:55,899
HE WOULD BE FLORIDA'S FIRST 

1661
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,466
AFRICAN-AMERICAN GOVERNOR. 

1662
00:53:56,466 --> 00:54:00,070
YOU HEARD HIM THERE TALK ABOUT 

1663
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,640
HIS SUPPORTERS. 

1664
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,407
THERE IS THE TWEET FROM SENATOR 

1665
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,075
SANDERS THAT I MENTIONED. 

1666
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:05,642
HE SAID CONGRATULATIONS TO 

1667
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,211
ANDREW GILLUM ON HIS VICTORY.  

1668
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:08,845
TONIGHT, FLORIDIANS JOINED HIM 

1669
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:09,445
IN STANDING UP AND DEMANDING 

1670
00:54:09,445 --> 00:54:13,950
REAL CHANGE . LET'S MAKE 

1671
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:14,651
HISTORY THIS NOVEMBER, AND MAKE 

1672
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:16,786
ANDREW GILLUM THE GOVERNOR OF 

1673
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:17,153
FLORIDA.  

1674
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:18,154
ED O'KEEFE, LET ME START WITH 

1675
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,790
YOU, FIRST OF ALL -- YOU KNOW, 

1676
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,361
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEEN 

1677
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:26,896
LOOKING FOR THE DIRECTION THAT 

1678
00:54:26,896 --> 00:54:29,966
WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY 

1679
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:31,668
TO TRY AND DEFEAT REPUBLICANS, 

1680
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:33,903
AND YOU HAVE SEENÃ

1681
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,172
PROGRESSIVES AND MODERATES TAKE 

1682
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:40,777
VARYING APPROACHES HERE. 

1683
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:41,477
HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT NOW THAT 

1684
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:42,479
YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE A ANDREW 

1685
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:43,179
GILLUM, WHO HAS PULLED OFF  

1686
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:44,647
WHAT IN MANY RESPECTS IS AN 

1687
00:54:44,647 --> 00:54:46,115
UPSET WHEN IN THAT PARTICULAR 

1688
00:54:46,115 --> 00:54:52,355
RACE? 

1689
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:52,789
WITH BERNIE SANDERS 

1690
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,122
ENDORSEMENT? 

1691
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:53,890
>> THIS IS A FAR BIGGER PRIZE 

1692
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,591
FOR THE PROGRESSIVE OR LIBERAL 

1693
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:56,126
WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY 

1694
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:56,926
THEN THE QUEENS CONGRESSIONAL 

1695
00:54:56,926 --> 00:55:01,764
SEAT THAT HAS BEEN ONE BY 

1696
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:02,331
ALEXANDRIA ACOSTA CORTEZ. 

1697
00:55:02,331 --> 00:55:02,899
MAKE NO MISTAKE, WINNING A 

1698
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:03,867
PRIMARY IN A SWING STATE IN 

1699
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,335
THIS COUNTRY,  IT IS A BIG 

1700
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:06,202
DEAL. 

1701
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:10,740
AND ANDREW GILLUM, THE 39-YEAR-

1702
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:11,474
OLD MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE DID IT 

1703
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,141
WITH THE SUPPORT OF BERNIE 

1704
00:55:12,141 --> 00:55:12,976
SANDERS AND TOM STIERS  NEXT 

1705
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,943
GEN ORGANIZATION. 

1706
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:16,145
WITH THE NATIONAL ENDORSEMENT 

1707
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:17,147
FROM INDIVISIBLE, THE GROUP 

1708
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:21,050
THAT WAS FORMED, GRASSROOTS -- 

1709
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:24,954
NETWORKS SINCE PRESIDENT TRUMP 

1710
00:55:24,954 --> 00:55:25,288
WAS ELECTED. 

1711
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,189
THEY RAISED A LOT OF MONEY IN 

1712
00:55:26,189 --> 00:55:27,222
THE CLOSING DAYS  AND THEY WERE 

1713
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:28,925
ABLE TO PULL IT OFF TONIGHT. 

1714
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:32,996
THAT WAS IN AN IMPRESSIVE WAY 

1715
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:33,829
AND THEY DID IT IN BROWARD 

1716
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:34,531
COUNTY IN THE SOUTH, 

1717
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,366
HLLSBOROUGH COUNTY, IN TAMPA 

1718
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,200
AND UP IN THE NORTH, WHERE HE 

1719
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,303
ENJOYS HIS BASE OF SUPPORT, AND 

1720
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:41,103
IT IS A CONSIDERABLE VICTORY. 

1721
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:41,971
AGAIN, I THINK FOR MORE 

1722
00:55:41,971 --> 00:55:43,172
SINIFICANT THAN THE MOVEMENT 

1723
00:55:43,172 --> 00:55:47,043
THAT ALEXANDRIA ACOSTA CORTEZ 

1724
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:47,677
STARTED HERE IN NEW YORK. 

1725
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,145
IF YOU CAN DO IT IN A STATE 

1726
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:55,185
LIKE FLORIDA,  I SUSPECT WE ARE 

1727
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,051
GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF LIBERALS 

1728
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:56,986
AND PROGRESSIVES SAY YOU CAN DO 

1729
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:57,319
IT ANYWHERE. 

1730
00:55:57,319 --> 00:55:58,221
>> ANTOINE, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE 

1731
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,255
ON THIS VICTORY? 

1732
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:00,290
>> I THINK THAT IT TAKES MANY 

1733
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,124
PARTS TO MAKE A CAR RUN. 

1734
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,291
YOU NEED THE ENGINE, 

1735
00:56:02,291 --> 00:56:05,462
TRANSMISSION, LIGHTS, TIRES, 

1736
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:05,895
ALL THE THINGS. 

1737
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:06,729
SO, I THINK BERNIE SANDERS AND 

1738
00:56:06,729 --> 00:56:07,630
ALL THE GROUPS THAT MENTIONED 

1739
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,565
ARE PARTS OF THE CAR THAT MAKE 

1740
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,234
THIS CAR RUN DOWN THE ROAD AS 

1741
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:11,834
THE WAY IT DID TONIGHT. 

1742
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,303
BUT, WHAT I THINK HAPPENED 

1743
00:56:14,303 --> 00:56:16,439
TONIGHT WAS THAT I THINK 

1744
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:20,777
ANDREW'S CAMPAIGN SET A TONE OR 

1745
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:21,678
A MODEL FOR WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE 

1746
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:23,213
GOING TO NEED TO DO TO BE 

1747
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,982
SUCCESSFUL IN NOVEMBE. 

1748
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:26,816
THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS -- 

1749
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:34,023
WE HAVE TRIED TO RUN IN THE 

1750
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:34,624
SOUTH WITH THE CAMPAIGNS. 

1751
00:56:34,624 --> 00:56:35,458
WE HAVE TRIED TO HAVE MODERATE 

1752
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:36,192
CANDIDATES AND RUN AWAY FROM 

1753
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,193
THE BASE. 

1754
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,063
BUT, ANDREW, AND STACEY ABRAMS 

1755
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,130
SHOWED THAT WHEN YOU TAKE CARE 

1756
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:44,067
OF HOME FIRST, EVERYTHING ELSE  

1757
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:44,400
BECOMES EASY. 

1758
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,134
IF WE CONTINUE THIS STRATEGY OF 

1759
00:56:45,134 --> 00:56:53,676
TAKING CARE OF THE BASE, MAKING 

1760
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:54,811
SURE THAT THE BASE TURNS OUT AS 

1761
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:55,512
DOUG JONES DID WITH 98% OF 

1762
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,079
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN WHO 

1763
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:56,679
SHOWED SUPPORT FOR HIM, AS 

1764
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,480
STACEY ABRAMS AND ANDREW DID 

1765
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,281
TONIGHT,  THEN WE WILL BE WELL-

1766
00:56:58,281 --> 00:56:58,948
POSITIONED TO WIN IN NOVEMBER. 

1767
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,149
>> GO AHEAD, CAITLIN. 

1768
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:06,055
>> WAS GOING TO SAY ESPECIALLY 

1769
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:06,789
SINCE HE IS RUNNING AGAINST RON 

1770
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:07,056
DESANTIS. 

1771
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:08,558
THIS WILL BE A TEST OF BASE 

1772
00:57:08,558 --> 00:57:10,860
ELECTORAL POLITICS  IN A STATE 

1773
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,193
LIKE FLORIDA. 

1774
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:12,128
>> WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO TALK 

1775
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:12,962
ABOUT, BUT RIGHT NOW WE WILL 

1776
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:15,465
TAKE A QUICK BREAK, MUCH MORE 

1777
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:16,098

ESPECIALLY SINCE HE'S RUNNING 

1784
00:58:12,388 --> 00:58:13,021
AGAINST RON DESANTIS. 

1785
00:58:13,021 --> 00:58:14,223
THIS IS POLITICS IN A STATE

I'M BILL WHITAKER WITH "60 

1799

MINUTES." 

1800
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,060
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 

1801
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:58,494
CONGRESSMAN MORENO. 

1802

>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS 

1803
00:59:59,628 --> 01:00:00,129
OUT OF CONTROL. 

1804
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:02,532
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 

1805
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:02,832
PEOPLE DIE. 

1806
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:05,635

1807
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:06,235
ABOUT THIS WITHOUT "60

>> I DID SEE THE REPORT. 

1810
01:00:07,636 --> 01:00:09,138
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE 

1811
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:12,175
REPORT AND TAKE IT VERY 

1812
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:15,244
SERIOUSLY. 

1813
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,646
>> THEY WERE JUST DRUG DEALERS 

1814
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:17,246
IN LAB COATS. 

1815
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,315

PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 

1817
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,264
>>> HI, EVERYONE. 

1818
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:35,965
I'M ELAINE QUIJANO. 

1819
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,632
WELCOME TO CBSN'S SPECIAL 

1820
01:00:36,632 --> 01:00:37,834
ELECTION COVERAGE OF THE 

1821
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,235
FLORIDA AND ARIZONA PRIMARIES 

1822
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:39,435
THIS. 

1823
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,337
IS THE LAST BIG PRIMARY DAY, 

1824
01:00:41,337 --> 01:00:43,573
BEFORE THE CRITICAL NOVEMBER 

1825
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:44,340
ELECTIONS. 

1826
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,308
TONIGHT'S RESULTS WILL DECIDE 

1827
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,476
MIDTERM MATCHUPS FOR GOVERNOR, 

1828
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:47,543
SENATE AND THE HOUSE. 

1829
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,779
IN ARIZONA, POLLS HAVE NOW JUST 

1830
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:50,346
CLOSED. 

1831
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:51,614
THE STATE'S REPUBLICAN SENATE 

1832
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,015
RACE HAS RECEIVED ENORMOUS 

1833
01:00:53,015 --> 01:00:53,316
ATTENTION. 

1834
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,584
IT FEATURES THREE CANDIDATES  

1835
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:57,253
WHO HAVE VIED FOR THE 

1836
01:00:57,253 --> 01:00:58,054
PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT, BUT 

1837
01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,688
HAVE NOT RECEIVE TODAY. 

1838
01:00:59,688 --> 01:01:01,791
THEY ARE RUNNING TO REPLACE GOP 

1839
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:02,992
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE, WHO IS 

1840
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:03,259
RETIRING. 

1841
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,627
THE RACES IN ARIZONA ARE 

1842
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:06,128
HAPPENING IN THE SHADOW OF 

1843
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:08,731
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S PASSING. 

1844
01:01:08,731 --> 01:01:09,198
THE LONG-TIME ARIZONA 

1845
01:01:09,198 --> 01:01:11,300
REPUBLICAN SEAT IS NOT UP FOR 

1846
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,000
GRABS TONIGHT. 

1847
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:12,968
BUT HIS DEATH HAS PUT A 

1848
01:01:12,968 --> 01:01:16,172
SPOTLIGHT ON THE FUTURE OF THE 

1849
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:16,572
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

1850
01:01:16,572 --> 01:01:18,074
>>> AND IN FLORIDA, WE ARE 

1851
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:20,910
SEEING THE FIRST UPSET OF THE 

1852
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,645
NIGHT, WHERE ANDREW GILLUM HAS 

1853
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:24,213
WON THE DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR 

1854
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:24,480
GOVERNOR. 

1855
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,148
HE WAS BACKED GUY BY SENATOR 

1856
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:28,184
BERNIE SANDERS AND NOW AIMS TO 

1857
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:30,053
BE THE FIRST BLACK GOVERNOR IN 

1858
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,955
FLORIDA HISTORY. 

1859
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,058
GILLUM WILL NOW FACE DESANTIS, 

1860
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,893
WHO DEFEATED PUTNAM IN THE 

1861
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,127
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY RACE. 

1862
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:41,197
THIS HAS BEEN TOUTED AS A PRESS 

1863
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,800
OF THE PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT. 

1864
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,601
EARLIER, HE CONGRATULATED HIM 

1865
01:01:45,601 --> 01:01:48,504
ON TWITTER, CALLING IT A 

1866
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,672
FANTASTIC WIN. 

1867
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,007
MEANWHILE NTHE SENATE RACE, 

1868
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:53,876
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT, 

1869
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:54,810
WON HIS PRIMARY. 

1870
01:01:54,810 --> 01:01:58,548
WHICH MEANS HE'LL FACE OFF 

1871
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,148
AGAINST DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT 

1872
01:01:59,148 --> 01:01:59,515
BILL NELSON. 

1873
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:04,220
WE HAVE A PANEL TO COVER EVERY 

1874
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,254
ASPECT OF TONIGHT'S RACES. 

1875
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:08,191
ED O'KEEFE. 

1876
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:11,360
CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS IS A 

1877
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,195
TRIBUTER AND REPORTER FOR 

1878
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:16,399
POLITICS. 

1879
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,166
AND FOUNDER AND CEO OF 

1880
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:19,969
BLUEPRINT STRATEGY. 

1881
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,238
AND RIGHT NOW, THOUGH, LET'S 

1882
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,372
TURN TO JOSEPH GARCIA. 

1883
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:25,808
HE IS WITH ARIZONA STATE 

1884
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:27,476
UNIVERSITY'S MORRISON INSTITUTE 

1885
01:02:27,476 --> 01:02:28,678
FOR PUBLIC POLICY. 

1886
01:02:28,678 --> 01:02:30,046
HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF 

1887
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:30,613
COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY 

1888
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:34,984
IMPACT AS WELL AS DIRECTOR OF 

1889
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,120
THE LATINO PUBLIC POLICY 

1890
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:38,688
CENTER. 

1891
01:02:38,688 --> 01:02:41,691
JOSEPH, THANK YOU FOR JOINING 

1892
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:41,857
US. 

1893
01:02:41,857 --> 01:02:45,428
YOU RECENTLY SAID BY 2030, 

1894
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,796
ARIZONA WOULD BE A MINORITY 

1895
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:48,030
STATE. 

1896
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,700
>> WITH MORE LATINOS GOING 

1897
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:51,400
THROUGH THE MATURATION PROCESS, 

1898
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,202
MORE LATINOS WILL BE ABLE TO 

1899
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:53,402
VOTE. 

1900
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,937
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND 

1901
01:02:54,937 --> 01:02:56,906
THAT LATINOS IN ARIZONA ARE A 

1902
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:57,940
VERY YOUNG POPULATION. 

1903
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,942
BUT ALL OF THEM ARE U.S. 

1904
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:00,209
CITIZENS. 

1905
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,311
SO THEY WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO 

1906
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,647
VOTE, ONCE THEY TURN 18. 

1907
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,782
BUT MANY LATINOS HAVE YET TO 

1908
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:07,049
TURN 18. 

1909
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:10,019
SO THE SUNANLY WAVE THAT WE -- 

1910
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,588
TSUNAMI WAVE WE HEAR OF LATINOS 

1911
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,490
HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE BALLOT 

1912
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:14,857
BOX. 

1913
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:19,195
IT'S GOING TO BE WAVE BY WAVE, 

1914
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:19,495
BY WAVE. 

1915
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:22,098
BUT BY 2030, ALL U.S. CITIZENS 

1916
01:03:22,098 --> 01:03:23,833
WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE. 

1917
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,068
AND COULD TURN ARIZONA FROM A 

1918
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,803
RED CONSERVATIVE STATE TO A 

1919
01:03:27,803 --> 01:03:28,336
BLUE PROGRESSIVE STATE. 

1920
01:03:28,336 --> 01:03:30,640
>> LESLIE, YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN 

1921
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:30,840
HERE? 

1922
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,107
>> SURE. 

1923
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:33,509
NO, YOU RAISED REALLY GOOD 

1924
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:34,443
POINTS ABOUT DEMOGRAPHICS. 

1925
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:35,911
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. 

1926
01:03:35,911 --> 01:03:37,980
THE PUSHBACK ON THAT IS THAT 

1927
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,015
MANY OF THESE YOUNG LATINOS 

1928
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:40,315
DON'T VOTE. 

1929
01:03:40,315 --> 01:03:44,320
DESPITE THE FACT THERE WILL BE 

1930
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:44,787
HIGHER REGISTRATION. 

1931
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:46,856
YOU GET LULACK OR THESE CIVIL 

1932
01:03:46,856 --> 01:03:48,291
RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS GETTING 

1933
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:48,824
THEM TO REGISTER. 

1934
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:51,027
ARE YOU SEEING ANY CHANGES IN 

1935
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,461
THE TREND TO GET THESE YOUNGER 

1936
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,130
VOTERS TO THE POLL? 

1937
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,298
>> YEAH, GETTING ANY YOUNGER 

1938
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,266
PEOPLE TO THE POLLS IS VERY 

1939
01:03:57,266 --> 01:04:00,102
DIFFICULT. 

1940
01:04:00,102 --> 01:04:02,872
FACT, A RECENT STUDY, WE HAVE A 

1941
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,441
REPORT OUT, THAT SHOWS THAT 

1942
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,910
HALF OF MILLENNIALS DON'T EVEN 

1943
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:08,310
REGISTER TO VOTE. 

1944
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:11,747
AND OF THREE POOLS  WHO LARGELY 

1945
01:04:11,747 --> 01:04:12,047
DON'T VOTE. 

1946
01:04:12,047 --> 01:04:13,482
YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T VOTE, POOR 

1947
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:16,352
PEOPLE DON'T VOTE, AND PEOPLE 

1948
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,120
WITH SOMEWHAT OF A LIMITED 

1949
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:18,620
EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. 

1950
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:21,190
CERTAINLY THEY DON'T FINISH 

1951
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:24,459
HIGH SCHOOL, OR FINISH COLLEGE. 

1952
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:25,160
THESE DON'T VOTE EITHER. 

1953
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:27,096
AND LATINOS ARE REPRESENTED IN 

1954
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:28,230
ALL THREE OF THOSE CATEGORIES. 

1955
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,366
SO IT IS A CHALLENGE. 

1956
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:34,904
BUT WHEN WE LOOKED AT EMERGING 

1957
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:35,271
LATINO VOTER. 

1958
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,206
WE LOOKED AT STRAIGHT LINE 

1959
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:37,540
PROJECTIONS. 

1960
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,077
THAT IS EVEN WITH NOTHING 

1961
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:44,980
CHANGING TODAY, WITH LAT OINOS 

1962
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:45,681
-- LATINOS REGISTERING. 

1963
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:49,151
THE LARGE NUMBER OF LAT -- 

1964
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:51,420
LATINOS COMING IN THE PROCESS, 

1965
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,756
ARIZONA WILL BECOME A MINORITY-

1966
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:54,590
MAJORITY STATE BY 2030. 

1967
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:56,391
IT'S JUST A GAME CHANGER. 

1968
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:59,729
IT COULD HAPPEN SOONER IF MORE 

1969
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:00,663
LATINOS BECOME INVOLVED AND 

1970
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:01,363
ENGAGE IN POLITICS AND VOTE. 

1971
01:05:01,363 --> 01:05:02,865
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES 

1972
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,267
THAT ARE FRONT AND CENTER IN 

1973
01:05:05,267 --> 01:05:06,135
ARIZONA? 

1974
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,104
>> WELL, EVERYONE WANTS TO TALK 

1975
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:08,670
ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION. 

1976
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,772
BUT ACTUALLY, EDUCATION IS THE 

1977
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:10,906
NUMBER 1 ISSUE IN ARIZONA. 

1978
01:05:10,906 --> 01:05:12,942
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG DECIDER 

1979
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:14,110
WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE -- 

1980
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,578
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG DECIDER 

1981
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,114
IN MANY OF THE STATE HOUSE -- 

1982
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:18,714
STATE RACES. 

1983
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,716
EDUCATION IS THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE 

1984
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,319
FOR LATINOS AND FOR ALL OF 

1985
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:23,619
ARIZONANS. 

1986
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:25,821
AND THAT IS BECAUSE LATINOS 

1987
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:27,956
KNOW THAT THROUGH ONE WAY OUT 

1988
01:05:27,956 --> 01:05:29,258
OF POVERTY IS THROUGH 

1989
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:30,659
EDUCATION. 

1990
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,029
NOW, IMMIGRATION, THOUGH, IS 

1991
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:33,329
IMPORTANT. 

1992
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,163
BECAUSE FOR LATINOS, 

1993
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:36,232
IMMIGRATION IS A VERY REAL AND 

1994
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:37,166
PERSONAL ISSUE. 

1995
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,235
FOR MANY LATINOS, THAT MAY MEAN 

1996
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,437
A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY COULD BE 

1997
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:41,704
DEPORTED. 

1998
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:43,205
IT COULD BE A NEIGHBOR. 

1999
01:05:43,205 --> 01:05:44,639
IT COULD BE A COWORKER. 

2000
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:45,340
A FRIEND. 

2001
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:48,210
IT IS A VERY REAL, PERSONAL 

2002
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,679
SITUATION. 

2003
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:55,484
FOR MANY NONLAT OINEYS, -- 

2004
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,319
NONLATINOS, IT IS A RHETORIC. 

2005
01:05:57,319 --> 01:05:59,421
THEY ARE NOT PERSONALLY 

2006
01:05:59,421 --> 01:05:59,688
IMPACTED. 

2007
01:05:59,688 --> 01:06:02,024
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW 

2008
01:06:02,024 --> 01:06:06,362
ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN DEPORTED. 

2009
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:07,896
IMMIGRATION IS A AN ISSUE BUT 

2010
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:09,698
NOT THE KEY ISSUE. 

2011
01:06:09,698 --> 01:06:10,866
>> ARE THERE MORE COMPETITIVE 

2012
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:13,802
RACES WHEN IT COMES TO THE 

2013
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:14,136
LATINO VOTE? 

2014
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,571
>> THE WAY THIS THING IS SET UP 

2015
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:17,673
IS THAT ARIZONA HAS A SEMI OPEN 

2016
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:18,106
PRIMARY SYSTEM. 

2017
01:06:18,106 --> 01:06:20,910
THAT MEANS EITHER YOU VOTE FOR 

2018
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,578
THE DEMOCRATIC BALLOT OR THE 

2019
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:23,011
REPUBLICAN BALLOT. 

2020
01:06:23,011 --> 01:06:24,112
AND OUR HUGE NUMBER OF 

2021
01:06:24,112 --> 01:06:25,147
INDEPENDENTS CAN CHOOSE ONE OF 

2022
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:28,751
THE BALLOTS. 

2023
01:06:28,751 --> 01:06:29,652
UNFORTUNATELY, ONLY 10% OF 

2024
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:30,986
INDEPENDENTS ACTUALLY VOTE IN 

2025
01:06:30,986 --> 01:06:31,353
THE PRIMARIES. 

2026
01:06:31,353 --> 01:06:33,154
AND A LOW NUMBER AS WELL, IN 

2027
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:34,022
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. 

2028
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:36,192
SO NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

2029
01:06:36,192 --> 01:06:37,860
PARTICIPATE IN THE PRIMARIES, 

2030
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:38,995
EVEN THOUGH OFTENTIMES, THE 

2031
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:39,829
PRIMARY DECIDES THE ELECTION 

2032
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,398
BECAUSE WE HAVE WHAT IS CALLED, 

2033
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:45,167
YOU KNOW, SAFE DISTRICTS. 

2034
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,402
THAT'S ONE PARTY. 

2035
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:47,570
EITHER THE DEMOCRATS OR 

2036
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,237
REPUBLICANS, OVERWHELMINGLY 

2037
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:51,974
OUTNUMBER IN THE OTHER PARTY IN 

2038
01:06:51,974 --> 01:06:52,407
CERTAIN DISTRICTS. 

2039
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:56,379
SO 20 TO 22 OF ARIZONA'S 

2040
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:57,146
LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS ARE 

2041
01:06:57,146 --> 01:06:58,280
CONSIDERED "SAFE" DISTRICTS, 

2042
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,582
WHERE ONE PARTY, WHOEVER WINS 

2043
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:02,484
THE PRIMARY IS PRETTY MUCH 

2044
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:03,986
GUARANTEED THAT NOMINEE IS 

2045
01:07:03,986 --> 01:07:06,021
GOING TO WIN THE GENERAL 

2046
01:07:06,021 --> 01:07:06,288
ELECTION. 

2047
01:07:06,288 --> 01:07:06,721
FOR ARIZONA'S NINE 

2048
01:07:06,721 --> 01:07:07,456
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS, WE'RE 

2049
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:08,923
ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE SAME 

2050
01:07:08,923 --> 01:07:09,291
THING. 

2051
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,626
IT'S -- THERE ARE SAFE 

2052
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:11,227
DISTRICTS. 

2053
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:12,528
SO SIX OF NINE OF ARIZONA'S 

2054
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:14,764
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS ARE 

2055
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:15,231
SAFE AS WELL. 

2056
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,032
-- WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE 

2057
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:18,200
PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEED A 

2058
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:18,867
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. 

2059
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:20,436
IT'S THOSE OTHER STATES THAT 

2060
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:21,503
ARE COMPETITIVE, WHERE YOU HAVE 

2061
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:23,939
SWING DISTRICTS AND GO EITHER 

2062
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:24,206
WAY. 

2063
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,142
OR THE MOST COMPETITION. 

2064
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:28,377
BUT DEMP CRATS HAVE -- 

2065
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,512
DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN A 

2066
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:32,180
DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY IN THIS 

2067
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:32,681
APPROACH. 

2068
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:33,849
WHERE THEY PUT DEMOCRATS IN 

2069
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,751
RACES, WHERE THEY ARE IN SAFE 

2070
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:36,051
DISTRICTS. 

2071
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:37,686
SETTING IT UP FOR MAYBE NOT 

2072
01:07:37,686 --> 01:07:39,255
THIS ELECTION BUT MAYBE 

2073
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:40,556
ELECTIONS ELECTIONS TO COME, 

2074
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:42,324
WHERE DEMOCRATS CAN FIGHT FOR 

2075
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:42,724
THOSE DISTRICTS. 

2076
01:07:42,724 --> 01:07:44,493
>> IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO 

2077
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,262
WATCH THE DYNAMICS PLAY OUT IN 

2078
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:46,562
YOUR STATE. 

2079
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:47,797
JOSEPH GARCIA, THANK YOU SO 

2080
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:48,230
MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. 

2081
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:49,098
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 

2082
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:50,733
>> THANK YOU. 

2083
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,637
>>> LET'S TURN NOW TO SUSAN 

2084
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:55,938
McMANNIS IS FLORIDA. 

2085
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:57,973
SHE IS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST 

2086
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,643
RAT THE -- SCIENTIST AT THE 

2087
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:01,710
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA. 

2088
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:03,145
SUSAN, WE'RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE 

2089
01:08:03,145 --> 01:08:03,479
YOUR INSIGHT. 

2090
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,081
THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT IN 

2091
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:07,349
YOUR STATE, STARTING WITH 

2092
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:07,716
ANDREW GILLUM. 

2093
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:09,718
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK MADE THE 

2094
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:10,118
DIFFERENCE HERE? 

2095
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:12,153
HOW WAS HE ABLE TO SECURE THE 

2096
01:08:12,153 --> 01:08:13,923
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR 

2097
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:14,190
GOVERNOR? 

2098
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:16,091
>> IT WAS LAST-MINUTE BUS TOUR 

2099
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:17,725
AROUND THE STATE, ENERGY FROM 

2100
01:08:17,725 --> 01:08:19,161
BERNIE SANDERS, A LOT OF MONEY 

2101
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,964
THAT WAS POURED IN SO THAT HE 

2102
01:08:21,964 --> 01:08:22,363
COULD ADVERTISE. 

2103
01:08:22,363 --> 01:08:25,533
IT WAS THE ENERGY AND THE 

2104
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,303
TURNOUT WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT 

2105
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,404
FOR HIM AND THE BIG 

2106
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:29,470
METROPOLITAN AREAS OF THE 

2107
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:31,106
STATE. 

2108
01:08:31,106 --> 01:08:33,175
IT'S ALSO EVIDENT THAT HE GOT A 

2109
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,944
LOT OF THE MINORITY VOTE AND 

2110
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,046
THE YOUNG VOTE IN FLORIDA, 

2111
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:41,149
WHICH IS NOW A LARGER PORTION 

2112
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:43,919
OF FLORIDA'S ELECTORATE THAT 

2113
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:45,587
MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE. 

2114
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:48,823
ABOUT 52% OF OUR ELECTORATE 

2115
01:08:48,823 --> 01:08:51,593
OVERALL, IS MILLENNIALS AND GEN-

2116
01:08:51,593 --> 01:08:52,627
EXERS AND THE HASHTAG 

2117
01:08:52,627 --> 01:08:52,928
GENERATION. 

2118
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:55,898
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT OVER 

2119
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:56,497
HALF OF FLORIDA'S REGISTERED 

2120
01:08:56,497 --> 01:08:57,399
DEMOCRATS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. 

2121
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:58,734
AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT HE 

2122
01:08:58,734 --> 01:09:01,237
TAPPED INTO THE YOUNG VOTE AND 

2123
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:02,636
THE PROGRESSIVE VOTE AND THE 

2124
01:09:02,636 --> 01:09:03,971
MINORITY VOTE. 

2125
01:09:03,971 --> 01:09:05,173
THAT WAS THE KEY TO VICTORY. 

2126
01:09:05,173 --> 01:09:07,142
AND IT WAS IN THE REALLY BIG 

2127
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:09,778
URBAN AREAS OF THE STATE THAT 

2128
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:10,845
HE PILED UP MARGINS OVER GWEN 

2129
01:09:10,845 --> 01:09:12,014
GRAHAM. 

2130
01:09:12,014 --> 01:09:13,249
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

2131
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:13,716
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 

2132
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:16,252
OF THIS. 

2133
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,053
YOU HAD CONGRESSMAN RON 

2134
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:18,920
DESANTIS, WHO WAS ENDORSED, OF 

2135
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:21,624
COURSE, BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

2136
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,059
HE WON THE GOP FOMINATION. 

2137
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,961
AS SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT 

2138
01:09:25,961 --> 01:09:27,263
DESPITE DESANTIS BEING ABLE TO 

2139
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,663
PULL OFF A WIN IN HIS PRIMARY, 

2140
01:09:28,663 --> 01:09:30,832
THAT IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR 

2141
01:09:30,832 --> 01:09:32,468
HIM TO SORT OF GO BACK TO THE 

2142
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,868
CENTER FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION 

2143
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:36,205
TO BE COMPETITIVE IN WHAT IS 

2144
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:37,238
STILL A SWING STATE. 

2145
01:09:37,238 --> 01:09:37,706
WHAT'S YOUR ANALYSIS? 

2146
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:41,542
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 

2147
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:42,611
VERY IDEOLOGICALLY-DRIVEN RACE. 

2148
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,513
BECAUSE YOU HAVE GILLUM, OF ALL 

2149
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:46,881
THE DEMOCRATS, WAS FARTHER TO 

2150
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:49,350
THE LEFT, AND DE SANTIS, 

2151
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,085
FARTHER TO THE RIGHT. 

2152
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:55,924
THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO HAVE TO 

2153
01:09:55,924 --> 01:09:56,892
PIVOT AND MOVE. 

2154
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,927
BECAUSE 28% OF FLORIDA'S 

2155
01:09:58,927 --> 01:10:00,061
REGISTERED VOTERS ARE NOT 

2156
01:10:00,061 --> 01:10:02,364
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. 

2157
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,600
DESANT I GUESS TAPPED INTO THE 

2158
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:04,967
TRUMP SUPPORT. 

2159
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,936
IT WAS REALLY UNCLEAR AS TO 

2160
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:10,506
WHETHER HE COULD REALLY RALLY 

2161
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:11,106
THESE SOMETIMES VOTER THAT 

2162
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,774
VOTED FOR HIM IN A MIDTERM 

2163
01:10:12,774 --> 01:10:13,041
ELECTION. 

2164
01:10:13,041 --> 01:10:14,710
BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY ABLE TO DO 

2165
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:16,478
THAT, WITH VOTES -- I MEAN, 

2166
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:17,646
WITH -- EXCUSE EXCUSE ME, WITH 

2167
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:23,218
A BIG RALLY HERE IN TAMPA. 

2168
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:24,286
AND CONSTANT TWEETS AND SO 

2169
01:10:24,286 --> 01:10:24,519
NORTH. 

2170
01:10:24,519 --> 01:10:24,786
-- FORTH. 

2171
01:10:24,786 --> 01:10:26,054
BUT IT WAS ALSO THE CASE THAT 

2172
01:10:26,054 --> 01:10:27,256
PUTNAM HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A 

2173
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,791
PROBLEM WITH THE FACT THAT HE 

2174
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:32,594
HAD BEEN IN OFFICE A LONG 

2175
01:10:32,594 --> 01:10:32,827
WHILE. 

2176
01:10:32,827 --> 01:10:34,463
SO I THINK LONGEVITY IN OFFICE 

2177
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:36,398
IS NOT AN ASSET IN THIS 

2178
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,098
PARTICULAR ELECTION CYCLE. 

2179
01:10:37,098 --> 01:10:39,234
IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALSO 

2180
01:10:39,234 --> 01:10:40,302
WATCHING FOR SENATOR NELSON 

2181
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,004
FROM FLORIDA ON THE DEMOCRATIC 

2182
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:42,204
SIDE. 

2183
01:10:42,204 --> 01:10:43,639
BUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES 

2184
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,975
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PIVOT TO 

2185
01:10:46,975 --> 01:10:47,576
THE MIDDLE. 

2186
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,278
>> SUSAN, IT'S ED O'KEEFE. 

2187
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:51,112
AND WE SHOULD REMIND VIEWERS. 

2188
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:54,917
SUSAN IS ONE OF THE PREMIERE 

2189
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,252
EXPERTS ON FLORIDA POLITICS. 

2190
01:10:57,252 --> 01:10:58,019
IF YOU'RE AN OUT-OF-TOWN 

2191
01:10:58,019 --> 01:10:59,822
REPORTER, AND YOU NEED TON 

2192
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:00,688
ABOUT FLORIDA ELECTIONS, YOU 

2193
01:11:00,688 --> 01:11:01,022
CALL SUSAN. 

2194
01:11:01,022 --> 01:11:05,194
AND SHE WILL LET YOU KNOW. 

2195
01:11:05,194 --> 01:11:07,262
SUSAN, SET THIS AGAINST YOUR 

2196
01:11:07,262 --> 01:11:08,897
IDEOLOGUES, AGAINST THE MODERN 

2197
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:09,731
POLITICAL HISTORY OF FLORIDA. 

2198
01:11:09,731 --> 01:11:11,500
HOW IS THIS RACE GOING TO SHAPE 

2199
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:11,967
UP? 

2200
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:13,035
AND WHERE IS THIS RACE GOING TO 

2201
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:15,237
BE WON FOR EITHER OF THESE 

2202
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,339
GUYS, IF THEY'VE GOT TO GO FIND 

2203
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:18,207
INDEPENDENT VOTERS ACROSS THE 

2204
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:18,440
STATE? 

2205
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,608
>> IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S GOING 

2206
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,543
TO BE ONE, I BELIEVE IN THE 

2207
01:11:21,543 --> 01:11:23,212
SUBURBAN AREAS OF THE STATE. 

2208
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,179
THE SWING VOTERS, WHERE YOU 

2209
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,616
HAVE FAMILIES. 

2210
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,684
THE BELLWETHER KINDS OF 

2211
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:31,086
COUNTIES, WHERE YOU SAW VOTERS  

2212
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,721
WHO VOTED FOR OBAMA BUT ALSO 

2213
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,423
THEN VOTED FOR TRUMP. 

2214
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:35,723
THAT KIND OF VOTER. 

2215
01:11:35,723 --> 01:11:37,493
I THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE 

2216
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:40,529
A BIG BATTLEGROUND. 

2217
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:41,496
AND OF COURSE, OUR ELECTORATES 

2218
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:41,863
CHANGE SO MUCH. 

2219
01:11:41,863 --> 01:11:44,600
WE'RE -- FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF 

2220
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,701
YEARS NOW, WE'VE BITTEN BACK 

2221
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:47,136
INTO THE SITUATION, WHERE WE 

2222
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,637
HAVE A THOUSAND PEOPLE MOVING 

2223
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:50,205
IN EVERY WEEK OR SO. 

2224
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:52,875
SO OUR WHOLE POPULATION IS 

2225
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:53,242
GROWN. 

2226
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,844
AND OUR ELECTED HAS GROWN 7 

2227
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:56,111
MILLION. 

2228
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,314
SO I THINK THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF 

2229
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,981
THE OF THE STATE -- OF THE 

2230
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:01,717
STATE HAS LIFTED A LITTLE BIT. 

2231
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:04,086
WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE TO LOOK 

2232
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,053
AT THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING 

2233
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:07,289
DEMOGRAPHIC OF OUR STATE, FOR 

2234
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,991
BOTH PARTIES AND ALSO FOR NO-

2235
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:09,424
PARTY AFFILIATION. 

2236
01:12:09,424 --> 01:12:13,562
BY THE WAY, THE LARGE, NO-PARTY 

2237
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:15,831
AFFILIATION, PART OF OUR 

2238
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,366
ELECTORATE, IS LARGELY, YOUNGER 

2239
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:18,267
VOTERS. 

2240
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:22,037
IN FACT, THE HASHTAG 

2241
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:23,071
GENERATION, 18- TO 21-YEAR-

2242
01:12:23,071 --> 01:12:23,271
OLDS. 

2243
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:24,606
40% ARE REGISTERING AS NO PARTY 

2244
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:24,939
AFFILIATION. 

2245
01:12:24,939 --> 01:12:29,344
THAT'S WHY I SAY, THIS LARGE 

2246
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:31,346
CLUMP OF NO PARTY AFFILIATION, 

2247
01:12:31,346 --> 01:12:34,116
AND EVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF 

2248
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:37,453
PUERTO RICANS ARRIVING ARE 

2249
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:39,154
REGISTERING AS NO ASMGZ. 

2250
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:39,954
YOU -- AFFILIATION. 

2251
01:12:39,954 --> 01:12:42,091
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS TIMEAT 

2252
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,526
THINGS THAT MAKE PEOPLE 

2253
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:45,293
ENERGIZED TO VOTE. 

2254
01:12:45,293 --> 01:12:47,696
>> THIS HASHTAG GENERATION. 

2255
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,898
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WATHAT. 

2256
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,433
SO 18 TO 21-YEAR-OLDS, THAT'S 

2257
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:54,570
WHAT YOU CALL THE HASHTAG 

2258
01:12:54,570 --> 01:12:55,070
GENERATION. 

2259
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,172
>> THE PEW RESEARCH CALLS IT 

2260
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:58,707
THE Z GENERATION. 

2261
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,242
BUT I'VE WILL RENAMED IT. 

2262
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:00,742
THE HASHTAG GENERATION. 

2263
01:13:00,742 --> 01:13:02,344
>> YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST. 

2264
01:13:02,344 --> 01:13:03,979
>> IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE 

2265
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,380
DEMOCRATS HAVE WON THE STATE OF 

2266
01:13:05,380 --> 01:13:05,647
FLORIDA. 

2267
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:06,815
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE 

2268
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:07,749
PARTICULAR CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN 

2269
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:09,217
FOR DEMOCRATS WHEN IT COMES TO 

2270
01:13:09,217 --> 01:13:10,586
THAT PARTICULAR CONTEST? 

2271
01:13:10,586 --> 01:13:11,819
>> A LOT OF IT HAS BEEN 

2272
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:12,086
TURNOUT. 

2273
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:13,655
AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS 

2274
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:15,090
WE WERE REALLY WATCHING 

2275
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:17,192
TONIGHT, WAS WHAT WOULD TURNOUT 

2276
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,295
LOOK LIKE. 

2277
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:24,166
IN THE CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE 

2278
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,500
-- IN THE REGISTRATION, 

2279
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,002
DEMOCRATIC-RICH REGERATION. 

2280
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,237
BUT PARTICULARLY, WE WERE 

2281
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,137
WATCHING MIAMI-DADE. 

2282
01:13:29,137 --> 01:13:30,005
BUT OF COURSE, BROWARD COUNTY, 

2283
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,406
WHICH WAS ONE OF THE LATE TO 

2284
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:33,107
COME IN THAT WERE WAS WATCHING 

2285
01:13:33,107 --> 01:13:33,374
CLOSELY. 

2286
01:13:33,374 --> 01:13:35,611
BECAUSE IN THE PAST, IT'S BEEN 

2287
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:40,115
THE MINORITY VOTE IN THOSE KEY 

2288
01:13:40,115 --> 01:13:42,351
COUNTIES, WITH LARGE DEM 

2289
01:13:42,351 --> 01:13:43,218
CRATTIC -- DEMOCRATIC 

2290
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:44,520
CONSTITUENCIES THAT HAVE NOT 

2291
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,489
TURNED OUT IN MIDTERM 

2292
01:13:47,489 --> 01:13:48,056
ELECTIONS. 

2293
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:51,427
IT'S COST FLORIDA DEMOCRATS A 

2294
01:13:51,427 --> 01:13:52,327
COUPLE OF GUBERNATORIAL 

2295
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:52,627
ELECTIONS. 

2296
01:13:52,627 --> 01:13:53,896
AND SOME COULD EVEN ARGUE IT 

2297
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,397
COST THEM THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE 

2298
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:55,998
LAST TIME. 

2299
01:13:55,998 --> 01:13:56,865
>> I'M JUST CURIOUS, TOO. 

2300
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:01,036
WE WERE TALKING TO A REPORTER 

2301
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:03,238
FROM WFOR, OUR CBS MIAMI 

2302
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:03,505
STATION. 

2303
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:04,506
WHO SAID, FOR ANDREW GILLUM, 

2304
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:06,275
AMONG THE THINGS THAT HELPED 

2305
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:09,778
PUSH HIM TO VICTORY, WERE THE 

2306
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:11,947
ENDORSEMENT FROM BERNIE 

2307
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:12,247
SANDERS. 

2308
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:14,550
BUT ALSO, MAYOR GILLUM'S 

2309
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:15,250
OPPOSITION TO "STAND YOUR 

2310
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:15,517
GROUND." 

2311
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:17,152
I WONDER, WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF 

2312
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:19,487
HOW THE ISSUE OF THE PARKLAND 

2313
01:14:19,487 --> 01:14:21,323
SHOOTING, HOW THE ISSUE OF GUNS 

2314
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:22,256
GENERALLY SHOULD BE VIEWED IN 

2315
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:24,927
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

2316
01:14:24,927 --> 01:14:26,828
>> WELL, IT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT 

2317
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:30,165
MANY HAVE DESCRIBED AS A MAJOR 

2318
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:30,632
ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS. 

2319
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,467
AND CERTAINLY GILLUM AND HIS 

2320
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:33,168
ACCEPTANCE SPEECH TONIGHT, 

2321
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,602
REALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT A LOT. 

2322
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:38,440
AND STAND YOUR GROUND HAS BEEN 

2323
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,144
A VERY MOBILIZING KIND OF ISSUE 

2324
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:42,978
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, PROGRESSIVES, 

2325
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,179
AND PARTICULARLY, PEOPLE OF 

2326
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:45,113
COLOR IN OUR STATE. 

2327
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,082
AND IT'S, OF COURSE, UNDER 

2328
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:47,415
ATTACK AGAIN. 

2329
01:14:47,415 --> 01:14:49,518
I ALSO THINK THAT ANOTHER HUGE 

2330
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:50,118
ISSUE IS THE ENVIRONMENT. 

2331
01:14:50,118 --> 01:14:52,154
AND AGAIN, I POINT TO THE 

2332
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,523
GENERATIONAL SHIFTS IN FLORIDA, 

2333
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,159
WHERE YOU HAVE THIS LARGER, 

2334
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:58,794
YOUNG DEMOGRAPHIC NOW, THAT IS 

2335
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:01,263
-- CAN BE DESCRIBED AS ONLY THE 

2336
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:02,898
ENVIRONMENTAL GENERATION. 

2337
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,866
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S 

2338
01:15:04,866 --> 01:15:08,837
PROBABLY EQUALLY AS MUCH OF A 

2339
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:10,338
DRAW TO THE YOUNGER 

2340
01:15:10,338 --> 01:15:11,073
CONSTITUENTS, DEMOCRATS, 

2341
01:15:11,073 --> 01:15:12,474
ESPECIALLY, AS THE GUN ISSUE. 

2342
01:15:12,474 --> 01:15:14,543
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SENATE 

2343
01:15:14,543 --> 01:15:15,143
RACE. 

2344
01:15:15,143 --> 01:15:16,244
YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR 

2345
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:17,312
RICK SCOTT, WINNING HIS 

2346
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:19,815
PRIMARY, WHICH MEANINGS HE'LL 

2347
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:21,850
FACE OFF AGAINST INCUMBENT 

2348
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:22,517
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, BILL 

2349
01:15:22,517 --> 01:15:22,985
NELSON. 

2350
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,152
THIS IS ALREADY THE MOST 

2351
01:15:24,152 --> 01:15:27,189
EXPENSIVE RACE OF THE 2018 

2352
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:27,455
MIDTERMS. 

2353
01:15:27,455 --> 01:15:29,324
THAT IS WITH GOVERNOR SCOTT 

2354
01:15:29,324 --> 01:15:30,425
OUTSPENDING NELSON BY A 4-1 

2355
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:31,093
MARGIN SO FAR. 

2356
01:15:31,093 --> 01:15:33,228
HOW BIG OF A FACTOR IS THAT? 

2357
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:34,696
>> WELL, IT'S STILL A TIED 

2358
01:15:34,696 --> 01:15:34,896
RACE. 

2359
01:15:34,896 --> 01:15:36,198
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE KIND OF 

2360
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:39,301
RACE THAT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE 

2361
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:39,701
VINTAGE FLORIDA. 

2362
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:40,736
AFTER ALL, THE LAST TWO 

2363
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:43,739
GOVERNOR'S RACES, AND THE LAST 

2364
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:44,472
TWO PRESIDENTIAL CONTESTS. 

2365
01:15:44,472 --> 01:15:45,874
THE WINNER HAS ONLY PREVAILED 

2366
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:46,207
BY 1%. 

2367
01:15:46,207 --> 01:15:47,542
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THIS COULD BE 

2368
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:48,443
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF 

2369
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:50,178
RACES. 

2370
01:15:50,178 --> 01:15:52,314
BUT YOU HAVE THE CASE, I THINK, 

2371
01:15:52,314 --> 01:15:54,916
OF WHERE THE SENATE RACE IS, IN 

2372
01:15:54,916 --> 01:15:56,985
IN A WAY, GOING TO BE AFFECTED 

2373
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:57,753
BY THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. 

2374
01:15:57,753 --> 01:15:58,553
BECAUSE IN MY OPINION. 

2375
01:15:58,553 --> 01:15:59,287
I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S 

2376
01:15:59,287 --> 01:16:02,156
RACE IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER 

2377
01:16:02,156 --> 01:16:04,726
DRAW -- DRAWING PEOPLE TO TURN 

2378
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:06,962
OUT TO VOTE THAN IS THE U.S. 

2379
01:16:06,962 --> 01:16:07,295
SENATE RACE. 

2380
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:08,630
BUT IT'S GOING TO GO DOWN TO 

2381
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:08,997
THE WIRE. 

2382
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,233
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE 

2383
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:11,666
ALREADY BEEN SPENT. 

2384
01:16:11,666 --> 01:16:13,001
EACH OF THE CANDIDATES HAS A 

2385
01:16:13,001 --> 01:16:15,203
DIMENSION THAT THE OTHER ONE IS 

2386
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:17,872
GOING AFTER. 

2387
01:16:17,872 --> 01:16:19,641
AND OF COURSE, THE ENVIRONMENT 

2388
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:19,874
IS ONE. 

2389
01:16:19,874 --> 01:16:20,408
HEALTHCARE IS ANOTHER. 

2390
01:16:20,408 --> 01:16:22,344
BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE RACES 

2391
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:24,479
THAT RIGHT NOW IS NOT AS 

2392
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:32,254
EXCITING RIGHT NOW, AS THE 

2393
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:32,654
GOVERNOR'S RACE. 

2394
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,623
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT -- 

2395
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:35,223
IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL 

2396
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,125
CONSEQUENCE MEANS THE FIGHT 

2397
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:40,028
WILL BE TO THE BITTER END. 

2398
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:43,732
DEMOCRATS FIGHTING TO HOLD ONTO 

2399
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:44,332
THE SEAT. 

2400
01:16:44,332 --> 01:16:46,468
AND REPUBLICANS DESPERATE TO 

2401
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:50,272
PICK ONE WHERE THEY MIGHT LOSE 

2402
01:16:50,272 --> 01:16:51,440
ONE SOMEWHERE ELSE. 

2403
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:56,545
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR 

2404
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:56,812
INSIGHT. 

2405
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:57,913
>> THANK YOU. 

2406
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,147
>> LET'S TURN TO ANTHONY 

2407
01:16:59,147 --> 01:16:59,715
SALVANTO. 

2408
01:16:59,715 --> 01:17:00,282
TELL US WHAT YOU'RE SEEING 

2409
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:01,483
THERE. 

2410
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:02,350
>> FIRST OF ALL. 

2411
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:04,553
LET ME PUT THE MONEY ISSUE AND 

2412
01:17:04,553 --> 01:17:06,154
THE SPENDING, WHAT WE THINK IS 

2413
01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:09,191
GOING TO BE A VERY EXPENSIVE 

2414
01:17:09,191 --> 01:17:09,524
SENATE RACE. 

2415
01:17:09,524 --> 01:17:09,958
IN PERSPECTIVE. 

2416
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:10,659
FLORIDA IS A SWING STATE. 

2417
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,662
IT IS ALSO ONE OF THE FEW SWING 

2418
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:14,362
STATES THAT COVERS REALLY 

2419
01:17:14,362 --> 01:17:16,898
EXPENSIVE TELEVISION MARKETS. 

2420
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:20,102
SO OTHER BIG EXPENSIVE STATES 

2421
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:22,738
LIKE NEW YORK OR CALIFORNIA 

2422
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:23,371
AREN'T SWING STATES. 

2423
01:17:23,371 --> 01:17:23,738
BUT FLORIDA IS. 

2424
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:25,440
SO IT'S EXPENSIVE TO RUN THERE. 

2425
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,744
AND LET ME SHOW YOU THE GILLUM 

2426
01:17:28,744 --> 01:17:30,245
RACE HERE IN THE DEMOCRATIC 

2427
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:30,512
PRIMARY. 

2428
01:17:30,512 --> 01:17:31,079
AND THE PROFESSOR MENTIONED 

2429
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:32,881
SOME OF THIS AS WELL. 

2430
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:35,083
THESE AREAS THAT YOU SEE DOWN 

2431
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:37,619
HERE THAT ARE SHADED IN A 

2432
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,854
LITTLE BIT OF THIS PURPLE-GRAY, 

2433
01:17:39,854 --> 01:17:41,990
MIAMI-DADE, BROWARD COUNTY, 

2434
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:43,291
THESE ARE PLACES WHERE GILLUM 

2435
01:17:43,291 --> 01:17:46,360
DID DO WELL, DID RUN UP SOME OF 

2436
01:17:46,360 --> 01:17:46,795
THOSE MARGINS. 

2437
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:48,463
EVEN UP INTO PALM BEACH HERE, 

2438
01:17:48,463 --> 01:17:49,630
AS VOTES COME IN. 

2439
01:17:49,630 --> 01:17:50,031
A NARROW ONE. 

2440
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:51,833
BUT HE HOLDS IT EVEN THERE. 

2441
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,235
YOU GO UP HERE. 

2442
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:54,369
LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY. 

2443
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,704
THAT'S THE ORLANDO AREA. 

2444
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:56,437
SO DEFINITELY IN THE CITIES. 

2445
01:17:56,437 --> 01:18:00,041
HE WAS ABLE TO RUN UP SOME SOME 

2446
01:18:00,041 --> 01:18:00,474
OF THOSE MARGINS. 

2447
01:18:00,474 --> 01:18:04,346
AND AS YOU MENTIONED, PULL OFF 

2448
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:04,679
THE UPSET. 

2449
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:05,881
RICK SCOTT, COMFORTABLY WINNING 

2450
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:06,181
THROUGHOUT. 

2451
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:07,149
SO THAT SETS UP THE SENATE 

2452
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:07,415
RACE. 

2453
01:18:07,415 --> 01:18:08,817
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN 

2454
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,453
FLORIDA, AS WE THEN WAIT TO SEE 

2455
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:11,786
WHAT HAPPENS. 

2456
01:18:11,786 --> 01:18:12,888
NOW, POLLS ARE CLOSED IN 

2457
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:13,155
ARIZONA. 

2458
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,756
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA IN 

2459
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:18,026
FROM THERE YET. 

2460
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:18,326
ELAINE. 

2461
01:18:18,326 --> 01:18:18,927
>> ALL RIGHT. 

2462
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:19,327
ANTHONY SALVANTO. 

2463
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:19,794
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

2464
01:18:19,794 --> 01:18:20,996
LET'S GO BACK TO OUR PANEL 

2465
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:21,196
HERE. 

2466
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:25,167
AND CHEW ON SOME OF WHAT WE 

2467
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,702
HEARD FROM SUSAN MacMANUS. 

2468
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:28,269
IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR 

2469
01:18:28,269 --> 01:18:30,338
CAITLIN -- TALK ABOUT THE FACT 

2470
01:18:30,338 --> 01:18:32,808
THAT THE IDEA OF SWING 

2471
01:18:32,808 --> 01:18:36,177
COUNTIES, THESE SUBURBAN VOTERS 

2472
01:18:36,177 --> 01:18:36,678
 

2473
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:37,211
HARD-FOUGHT BATTLEGROUND 

2474
01:18:37,211 --> 01:18:38,280
TERRITORY FOR CANDIDATES. 

2475
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:42,284
WHAT DO YOU THINK -- 

2476
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:43,018
PARTICULARLY WITH THE 

2477
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,086
GUBERNATORIAL CONTEST, WHAT DO 

2478
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:44,886
YOU THINK THE CHALLENGES ARE 

2479
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,389
GOING TO BE FOR EACH CANDIDATE 

2480
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:47,622
THERE? 

2481
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:48,556
>> WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. 

2482
01:18:48,556 --> 01:18:49,991
AND WE'RE SEEING THIS IN 

2483
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:50,992
GEORGIA, TOO, IS THIS IDEA THAT 

2484
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:53,595
IT'S GOING TO BE A BASE 

2485
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,965
ELECTION ON THE GUBERNATORIAL 

2486
01:18:56,965 --> 01:18:59,634
ELECTION, AT LEAST. 

2487
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:01,002
YOU HAVE UNABASHED IDEOLOGUE. 

2488
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:02,037
TO BORROW SOME PHRASING FROM ED 

2489
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:02,237
HERE. 

2490
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,172
SO THAT'S GOING TO BE AN 

2491
01:19:04,172 --> 01:19:04,805
INTERESTING DYNAMIC. 

2492
01:19:04,805 --> 01:19:05,674
THEN PAIRED WITH THE SENATE 

2493
01:19:05,674 --> 01:19:06,041
RACE. 

2494
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:06,775
REMEMBER THAT FLORIDA -- YOU 

2495
01:19:06,775 --> 01:19:09,077
KNOW, ALL EYES ARE GOING TO BE 

2496
01:19:09,077 --> 01:19:09,377
ON FLORIDA. 

2497
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:10,779
BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MANY 

2498
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:11,546
COMPETITIVE RACES. 

2499
01:19:11,546 --> 01:19:13,415
BUT ALSO NA LOT OF THESE -- IN 

2500
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:16,117
A LOT OF THESE KEY DISTRICTS. 

2501
01:19:16,117 --> 01:19:20,655
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY 

2502
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:20,956
DISTRICTS. 

2503
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,957
CARLOS -- DISTRICTS THAT 

2504
01:19:22,957 --> 01:19:23,491
HILLARY CLINTON WON 

2505
01:19:23,491 --> 01:19:24,192
OVERWHELMINGLY, TRYING TO 

2506
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:27,129
CREATE THEIR OWN BRANDS IN 

2507
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:27,529
THEIR DISTRICTS. 

2508
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:28,730
TRYING TO LOCALIZE THOSE RACES 

2509
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,065
AGAINST KIND OF THE NATIONAL, 

2510
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:30,298
TIED. 

2511
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:31,099
THAT WILL BE REALLY INTERESTING 

2512
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,201
TO WATCH HERE, TOO. 

2513
01:19:33,201 --> 01:19:34,903
AND THOSE KINDS OF VOTERS, WILL 

2514
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:36,438
BE REALLY CRITICAL IN THOSE 

2515
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:36,805
DISTRICTS, TOO. 

2516
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:38,573
TRYING TO GET VOTERS TO SEE, 

2517
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:40,041
MAYBE IF THEY SPLIT THE TICKET. 

2518
01:19:40,041 --> 01:19:41,076
MAYBE IF THEY CAN SEPARATE 

2519
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:42,410
THEMSELVES FROM THE NATIONAL 

2520
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:42,944
úE 

2521
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:44,212
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 

2522
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:45,247
DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE 

2523
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:46,748
KNOW, DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO 

2524
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:48,649
SPEND AS MUCH TIME IN FLORIDA 

2525
01:19:48,649 --> 01:19:50,852
AS HE POSSIBLY CAN. 

2526
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:51,619
HE LOVES CAMPAIGNING THERE. 

2527
01:19:51,619 --> 01:19:53,155
IT'S A STATE THAT HE JUST LOVES 

2528
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:53,755
BEING IN 

2529
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:55,991
SO THAT WILL BE KIND OF AN 

2530
01:19:55,991 --> 01:19:58,860
INTERESTING DYNAMIC HERE, TOO. 

2531
01:19:58,860 --> 01:19:59,327
LESLIE? 

2532
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:00,628
>> REALLY INTERESTING POINT. 

2533
01:20:00,628 --> 01:20:04,065
BECAUSE I'M HEARING FROM MARIA 

2534
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:05,267
ELVIRAS-SALAZAR, WHICH IS THE 

2535
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:09,137
REPUBLICAN WHO WON THE 

2536
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:13,141
NOMINATION FOR ILEANA ROTH 

2537
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:14,809
LATON'S SEAT. 

2538
01:20:14,809 --> 01:20:17,479
SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF A 

2539
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:17,746
MODERATE. 

2540
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:19,414
SHE HAS LGBT RIGHTS WILL, MUCH 

2541
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:21,749
MORE OF A GLOBAL LEADER. 

2542
01:20:21,749 --> 01:20:22,584
AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE 

2543
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:25,086
SALAZAR IS HEARING HERSELF THE 

2544
01:20:25,086 --> 01:20:25,353
SAME WAY. 

2545
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,088
SHE IS MODELING ILEANA VERY 

2546
01:20:27,088 --> 01:20:27,789
MUCH, THE CONGRESSWOMAN. 

2547
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:30,859
GOING TO SEE HERSELF AS A MOD 

2548
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:31,126
MODERATE. 

2549
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:31,760
AND SHE WAS ASKED DIRECTLY, DO 

2550
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:32,327
YOU WANT DONALD TRUMP TO 

2551
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:33,361
SUPPORT YOU AND CAMPAIGN FOR 

2552
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:33,594
YOU. 

2553
01:20:33,594 --> 01:20:35,730
AND SHE GOES, WE HAVE YET TO 

2554
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,165
MAKE THAT DECISION. 

2555
01:20:37,165 --> 01:20:44,072
SO WHILE THIS WAVE OF TRUMP IS 

2556
01:20:44,072 --> 01:20:45,640
GOING TO BE TO BE FLYING INTO 

2557
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:46,107
FLORIDA. 

2558
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:52,247
IT'S GOING TO BE A SERIES OF 

2559
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:54,316
EVASIVE MOVE MANEUVERS -- 

2560
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,350
EVASIVE MANEUVERS. 

2561
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,318
>> THIS IDEA OF COMPOLING 

2562
01:20:57,318 --> 01:20:57,852
CANDIDATE -- COMPELLING 

2563
01:20:57,852 --> 01:21:01,289
CANDIDATES TO WIN OUT THE DAY. 

2564
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:01,889
REPUBLICANS HOPING FOR THAT. 

2565
01:21:01,889 --> 01:21:03,992
BUT DEMOCRATS CERTAINLY HAVE A 

2566
01:21:03,992 --> 01:21:05,860
LOT OF COMPELLING CANDIDATES 

2567
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:06,962
THAT THEY'RE ENJOYING TOUTING 

2568
01:21:06,962 --> 01:21:09,130
THAT REPRESENT, YOU KNOW, THEIR 

2569
01:21:09,130 --> 01:21:09,597
DISTRICTS FOR STATES 

2570
01:21:09,597 --> 01:21:11,132
SPECIFICALLY. 

2571
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:12,067
WE'LL SEE IF GILLUM DOES 

2572
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:14,569
REPRESENT HIS IN THE NATIONAL 

2573
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:14,835
TURNOUT. 

2574
01:21:14,835 --> 01:21:17,272
>> I MEAN, I'M WONDERING, FROM 

2575
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,441
YOUR PERSPECTIVE, ANTOINE, AS A 

2576
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:20,141
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, IF YOU 

2577
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:20,875
ARE WATCHING PRESIDENT TRUMP 

2578
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,244
COME INTO THE STATE OF FLORIDA 

2579
01:21:23,244 --> 01:21:25,146
AND YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THOSE 

2580
01:21:25,146 --> 01:21:29,150
SUBURBAN VOTERS AND THOSE SWING 

2581
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:30,084
COUNTIES, THAT PROFESSOR 

2582
01:21:30,084 --> 01:21:31,686
MacMANUS TALKED ABOUT, THAT ARE 

2583
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:32,887
GOING TO BE REALLY DECIDING 

2584
01:21:32,887 --> 01:21:33,220
FACTORS HERE. 

2585
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:34,756
WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT WHEN YOU 

2586
01:21:34,756 --> 01:21:36,558
SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP COME INTO 

2587
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:40,428
THE STATE, CAMPAIGNING FOR A 

2588
01:21:40,428 --> 01:21:42,230
RON DISANTIS, CAMPAIGNING 

2589
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,732
AGAINST ANDREW GILLUM? 

2590
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,101
>> FIRST OF ALL, I SAY, GAME 

2591
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:46,468
ON. 

2592
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:47,535
BECAUSE WHAT I HAVE REALIZED. 

2593
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:51,006
AND WHAT WE HAVE SEEN JUST BY 

2594
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:53,141
PURE FACT. 

2595
01:21:53,141 --> 01:21:53,574
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

2596
01:21:53,574 --> 01:21:54,075
AND SPECIAL ELECTIONS. 

2597
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:54,742
SPECIAL SEATS, ET CETERA. 

2598
01:21:54,742 --> 01:21:55,510
THAT FRIENDS WILL NOT LET 

2599
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:57,045
FRIENDS VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP 

2600
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:00,281
AND HIS PARTY IN THESE 

2601
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:00,614
ELECTIONLESS. 

2602
01:22:00,614 --> 01:22:02,016
SO BRING -- ELECTIONS. 

2603
01:22:02,016 --> 01:22:03,751
SO BRING TRUMP ON. 

2604
01:22:03,751 --> 01:22:05,119
THE FACT, THE ROAD FOR 

2605
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:05,920
DEMOCRATS TO TAKE BACK 

2606
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,422
CONGRESS, OR TO TAKE OUR 

2607
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,057
COUNTRY BACK, WILL MEAN KEY 

2608
01:22:09,057 --> 01:22:10,024
RACES IN FLORIDA. 

2609
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:10,458
AND GUESS WHAT. 

2610
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:11,559
IN THOSE PLACES, AND I KNOW 

2611
01:22:11,559 --> 01:22:13,194
THIS FOR SURE, THE PRESIDENT IS 

2612
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:14,529
NOT THE MOST POPULAR PERSON. 

2613
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:15,897
THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE 

2614
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:17,665
CANDIDATES TRYING TO RUN FULL 

2615
01:22:17,665 --> 01:22:18,767
STEAM BACKWARD AWAY FROM HIM AS 

2616
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:20,201
HE COMES INTO THE STATE, THAT 

2617
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:21,269
MEANS HE'S GOING TO SUPPRESS A 

2618
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:23,271
LOT OF VOTERS IN THOSE PLACES 

2619
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,472
WHERE THE GOP WOULD NEED TO 

2620
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,341
WIN, IN ORDER TO WIN THE STATE, 

2621
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:29,511
VERSUS US THE SENATE AND THE 

2622
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:29,944
GUBERNATORIAL RACE. 

2623
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:32,047
THE OTHER FACTOR IS THAT THE 

2624
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:33,281
PROFESSOR TALKED ABOUT THE 

2625
01:22:33,281 --> 01:22:35,283
SURGE AND A NUMBER OF PEOPLE 

2626
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:35,850
MOVING TO FLORIDA PER WEEK. 

2627
01:22:35,850 --> 01:22:37,318
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THOSE 

2628
01:22:37,318 --> 01:22:37,851
PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO. 

2629
01:22:37,851 --> 01:22:39,454
IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THEY'RE 

2630
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:39,787
COMING FROM. 

2631
01:22:39,787 --> 01:22:43,491
YOU CAN ALMOST COIN THEM IN THE 

2632
01:22:43,491 --> 01:22:44,191
DEMOCRATIC OR LEAN DEMOCRATIC 

2633
01:22:44,191 --> 01:22:44,458
CATEGORY. 

2634
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:46,428
THAT'S A BIG GIFT FOR A PLACE 

2635
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:46,927
LIKE FLORIDA. 

2636
01:22:46,927 --> 01:22:49,230
THAT'S A BIG GET FOR A 

2637
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:50,765
PROGRESSIVE CAMP LIKE ANDREW 

2638
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:50,998
GILLUM. 

2639
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:52,734
THAT'S A BIG, SECURE GET, FOR A 

2640
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:55,737
BILL NELSON, WHO IS A VERY 

2641
01:22:55,737 --> 01:22:56,137
MODERATE SENATOR. 

2642
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:59,140
HE WON'T FIND HIM TAKING ON THE 

2643
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,275
PROGRESSIVE ISSUESS IN THE 

2644
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:00,675
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. 

2645
01:23:00,675 --> 01:23:06,548
I THINK ALL OF THOSE THINGS, 

2646
01:23:06,548 --> 01:23:08,049
POSITION DEMOCRATS FOR 

2647
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:08,316
NOVEMBER. 

2648
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:08,916
LISTEN, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN. 

2649
01:23:08,916 --> 01:23:21,129
THE CAR CAN DRIVE OFF THE ROAD. 

2650
01:23:21,129 --> 01:23:22,530
>> IF -- IF YOU'RE RICK SCOTT, 

2651
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,533
YOU HAVE TO RUN A SLIGHTLY 

2652
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:26,101
DIFFERENT RACE THAN RON 

2653
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:27,769
DESANTIS TO WIN. 

2654
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,238
I HAVE TO BELIEVE, GILLUM, THE 

2655
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:32,006
NOMINEE HAS TO HELP GILLUM WITH 

2656
01:23:32,006 --> 01:23:34,442
THE BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS OF 

2657
01:23:34,442 --> 01:23:34,742
THE STATE. 

2658
01:23:34,742 --> 01:23:35,042
>> BASIC. 

2659
01:23:35,042 --> 01:23:37,011
NOT JUST BLACK AND BROWN. 

2660
01:23:37,011 --> 01:23:37,979
BECAUSE THERE'S PROGRESSIVE 

2661
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:39,447
WHITES IN THE STATE, WHO 

2662
01:23:39,447 --> 01:23:40,114
TRADITIONALLY PROBABLY WOULDN'T 

2663
01:23:40,114 --> 01:23:43,151
BE AS EXCITED TO COME OUT AND 

2664
01:23:43,151 --> 01:23:45,787
PRESS THE BUTTON FOR A BILL 

2665
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:49,357
NELSON TYPE BECAUSE HE'S A VERY 

2666
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,024
MOODERATE SENATOR -- MODERATE 

2667
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:50,291
SENATOR. 

2668
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:53,461
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A 

2669
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:55,230
LOT OF CONSISTENCY, BETWEEN 

2670
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:58,733
DESANTIS AND SCOTT OR GILLUM. 

2671
01:23:58,733 --> 01:24:00,201
>> FOR EXACTLY THAT REASON. 

2672
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,135
WE HAD A CLOSED PRIMARY. 

2673
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:04,105
INDEPENDENTS DIDN'T HAVE A 

2674
01:24:04,105 --> 01:24:04,538
PLACE TO GO TODAY. 

2675
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:06,474
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO BE 

2676
01:24:06,474 --> 01:24:06,807
LOOKING LIKE? 

2677
01:24:06,807 --> 01:24:09,310
ARE THEY GOING TO BE LOOKING AT 

2678
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,445
THIS VERY NEW, PROGRESSIVE, 

2679
01:24:10,445 --> 01:24:12,513
BLUE FLORIDA OTHER THAT IS END 

2680
01:24:12,513 --> 01:24:13,581
OF I.C.E., MEDICARE, SOME OF 

2681
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,250
THE THEMES THAT YOU SAW? 

2682
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,751
WHAT IS INTERESTING, I WOULD 

2683
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:21,389
SAY, THOUGH, IS WHAT I THINK 

2684
01:24:21,389 --> 01:24:24,425
YOU SAW WITH GRAHAM, TWEETING 

2685
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:27,796
RIGHT AAWAY TRYING TO COALLEYS 

2686
01:24:27,796 --> 01:24:29,264
THAT BASE. 

2687
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:30,231
WE -- COALESCE. 

2688
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:33,134
WE DON'T DO THAT AS FAST BUT 

2689
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:34,635
THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING THE 

2690
01:24:34,635 --> 01:24:37,138
CORE BLOC OF WHAT THAT IS GOING 

2691
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:38,606
TO LOOK LIKE. 

2692
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,408
SOME INDEPENDENTS TEND TO LEAN 

2693
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:41,242
DEMOCRATIC. 

2694
01:24:41,242 --> 01:24:42,143
>> IN FLORIDA. 

2695
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:42,643
>> IN FLORIDA. 

2696
01:24:42,643 --> 01:24:45,546
THOSE SMALL PERCENTAGES. 

2697
01:24:45,546 --> 01:24:47,781
THAT MAY BE THE MARGIN, ED. 

2698
01:24:47,781 --> 01:24:48,415
ARE THEY LEFT-LEANING INDIES 

2699
01:24:48,415 --> 01:24:51,486
WHO ARE GOING TO BE THE ONES 

2700
01:24:51,486 --> 01:24:52,019
WHO WILL MOBILIZE. 

2701
01:24:52,019 --> 01:24:53,621
>> THE KEY FOR DEMOCRATS, YOU 

2702
01:24:53,621 --> 01:24:56,191
BROUGHT UP A VERY VALID POINT 

2703
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:58,760
IS FOR US TO BE ROCK SOLID, 

2704
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,427
UNITED ON ALL POINTS. 

2705
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,528
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO HAVE ONE 

2706
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:01,362
CRACK WITHIN THE PARTY. 

2707
01:25:01,362 --> 01:25:03,264
AND THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS 

2708
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:05,266
WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL AT IN 

2709
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:05,466
2016. 

2710
01:25:05,466 --> 01:25:07,302
IN SPITE OF ALL THE THINGS 

2711
01:25:07,302 --> 01:25:09,070
TRUMP SAID AND DONE, THEY MAY 

2712
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:10,972
HAVE COME FROM THE CAMPAIGN, 

2713
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:11,639
REPUBLICANS SAID, YOU KNOW 

2714
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:11,839
WHAT? 

2715
01:25:11,839 --> 01:25:14,108
WE'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE 

2716
01:25:14,108 --> 01:25:14,475
PARTY. 

2717
01:25:14,475 --> 01:25:16,678
VERSUS DEMOCRATS, YOU HAD THE 

2718
01:25:16,678 --> 01:25:17,745
PROGRESSIVE AND THE BERNIE, 

2719
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,914
PRIMARY VOTER SAYING WE'RE 

2720
01:25:19,914 --> 01:25:21,182
GOING TO VOTE THIRD PARTY OR 

2721
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:24,385
NOT SHOW UP AT ALL, OR WRITE IN 

2722
01:25:24,385 --> 01:25:24,685
CANDIDATES. 

2723
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:25,887
AND IN SOME PLACES, THAT MADE 

2724
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:26,421
ALL THE DIFFERENCE. 

2725
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,156
THE OTHER THING, I CAUTION MY 

2726
01:25:29,156 --> 01:25:29,990
DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS ABOUT IS 

2727
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:32,193
WIPE OUT EVERY POLL THAT YOU 

2728
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:34,028
SEE, WHETHER IT'S GENERIC OR 

2729
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:36,364
WHETHER IT HAS -- WHATEVER IT 

2730
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:36,564
SAYS. 

2731
01:25:36,564 --> 01:25:37,699
BECAUSE POLLS DO NOT MATTER IN 

2732
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:40,468
AN ENVIRONMENT NA RACE LIKE 

2733
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:44,539
THIS -- IN A RACE LIKE THIS. 

2734
01:25:44,539 --> 01:25:45,640
BECAUSE POLLS ARE A SIMPLE 

2735
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,107
SNAPSHOT OF THE TIME. 

2736
01:25:46,107 --> 01:25:48,710
AND WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL 

2737
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,077
NOT TO FALL INTO THE HILLARY 

2738
01:25:50,077 --> 01:25:52,513
CLINTON 2016 TRAP.

WE HAVE TO SNEAK IN A QUICK 

2742
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:58,118
BREAK. 

2743
01:25:58,118 --> 01:25:59,420
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE PRIMARY 

2744
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,588
NIGHT COVERAGE WHEN WE RETURN. 

2745
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:03,524
INCLUDING A LOOK AT WHAT TO

01:26:03,524 --> 01:26:05,160
EXPECT COME NOVEMBER.

AS WE EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF 

2752
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,847
TECHNOLOGY ON OUR ABILITY TO 

2753
01:28:39,847 --> 01:28:40,080
FOCUS. 

2754
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:42,116
>> CAN YOU GO OFF, DOWN A 

2755
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:44,318
RABBIT HOLE AND TELLS YOU.

TECHNOLOGY. 

2761
01:28:50,358 --> 01:28:52,026
AND INCREASINGLY, I'VE HAD THIS 

2762
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:52,393
HUNTED FEELING. 

2763
01:28:52,393 --> 01:28:53,861

01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:54,862

BOTH ARIZONA AND FLORIDA. 

2774
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:26,327
I WANT TO BRING IN LARRY 

2775
01:29:26,327 --> 01:29:26,560
SABIDO. 

2776
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,095
AND LARRY, FIRST OF ALL, LET'S 

2777
01:29:28,095 --> 01:29:30,231
GET YOUR TAKE ON WHAT WE HAVE 

2778
01:29:30,231 --> 01:29:33,000
SEEN IN FLORIDA TONIGHT, WITH 

2779
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,335
ANDREW GILLUM AND RON DESANTIS, 

2780
01:29:35,335 --> 01:29:38,272
WINNING THEIR RESPECTIVE RACES. 

2781
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:39,139
>> DESANTIS WAS EXPECTED. 

2782
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:40,141
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN 

2783
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,242
BEATING THE DRUMS FOR HIM FOR A 

2784
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,744
LONG TIME. 

2785
01:29:43,744 --> 01:29:46,414
AND TRUMP IS ACTUALLY MORE 

2786
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:47,882
POPULAR OR HAS MAINTAINED HIS 

2787
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:48,382
POPULARITY IN FLORIDA. 

2788
01:29:48,382 --> 01:29:50,618
MUCH BETTER THAN HE HAS IN 

2789
01:29:50,618 --> 01:29:50,951
OTHER STATES. 

2790
01:29:50,951 --> 01:29:55,890
THERE'S SOME KIND OF TIE THERE 

2791
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:58,192
BEYOND WINNING THE ELECTION IN 

2792
01:29:58,192 --> 01:29:58,392
2016. 

2793
01:29:58,392 --> 01:30:00,261
SO DESANTIS, AS EXPECTED, 

2794
01:30:00,261 --> 01:30:02,530
DEFEATED THE ORIGINAL FRONT 

2795
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:02,864
RUNNER. 

2796
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:05,266
FRONT RUNNER BY A MILE, ADAM 

2797
01:30:05,266 --> 01:30:05,499
PUTNAM. 

2798
01:30:05,499 --> 01:30:07,602
AND NOW, AN EVEN BIGGER UPSET 

2799
01:30:07,602 --> 01:30:09,136
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, A GIANT 

2800
01:30:09,136 --> 01:30:11,672
UPSET, WHETHER IT'S RIGHT OR 

2801
01:30:11,672 --> 01:30:13,274
NOT, MOST DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN 

2802
01:30:13,274 --> 01:30:15,476
FLORIDA HAVE BEEN PRETTY HONEST 

2803
01:30:15,476 --> 01:30:16,544
IN SAYING THEY BELIEVE THAT 

2804
01:30:16,544 --> 01:30:18,312
GWEN GRAHAM HAD A MUCH BETTER 

2805
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:20,247
CHANCE OF WINNING THE GENTLEMAN 

2806
01:30:20,247 --> 01:30:21,415
ELECTION THAN ANDREW GILLUM. 

2807
01:30:21,415 --> 01:30:25,153
MAYBE THEY'RE WRONG. 

2808
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:26,954
WHAT GETTING GET -- GOING TO 

2809
01:30:26,954 --> 01:30:27,889
DEPEND ON, IN MY VIEW, IS 

2810
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:31,058
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A TRULY 

2811
01:30:31,058 --> 01:30:31,658
SUBSTANTIAL DEMOCRATIC WAVE. 

2812
01:30:31,658 --> 01:30:36,230
WE DON'T SEE EVIDENCE FOR IT 

2813
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:36,430
YET. 

2814
01:30:36,430 --> 01:30:38,065
AND I THINK ANTHONY SALVANTO 

2815
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:39,834
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT, BASED ON 

2816
01:30:39,834 --> 01:30:41,102
THE CBS POLLS OUT SO FAR. 

2817
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:42,770
MAYBE IT WILL BE CLOSER TO 

2818
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:43,137
ELECTION DAY. 

2819
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:45,006
BUT IF THERE IS A WAVE, THINK 

2820
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:46,274
ABOUT IT SWEEPING ACROSS THE 

2821
01:30:46,274 --> 01:30:48,309
UNITED STATES. 

2822
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:49,843
AND HOW COULD IT MISS FLORIDA? 

2823
01:30:49,843 --> 01:30:54,649
FLORIDA IS A PENINSULA. 

2824
01:30:54,649 --> 01:30:58,419
AT LEAST IN IN THIS 

2825
01:30:58,419 --> 01:30:59,520
METAPHORICAL WAY, FLORIDA WOULD 

2826
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,253
HAVE TO BE INCLUDED. 

2827
01:31:00,253 --> 01:31:02,323
BUT IT HAS TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL 

2828
01:31:02,323 --> 01:31:03,557
WAY FOR GILLUM TO WIN. 

2829
01:31:03,557 --> 01:31:04,758
WHAT GIVES HIM THE CHANCE OF 

2830
01:31:04,758 --> 01:31:06,227
WINNING IS NOT ONLY THE 

2831
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:08,195
POSSIBILITY OF A BLUE WAVE. 

2832
01:31:08,195 --> 01:31:10,665
BUT ALSO, DESANTIS IS EVERY BIT 

2833
01:31:10,665 --> 01:31:12,099
AS FAR RIGHT AS GILLUM WILL BE 

2834
01:31:12,099 --> 01:31:15,636
CONSIDERED FAR LEFT. 

2835
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,572
AS YOUR FLORIDA EXPERT WAS ON, 

2836
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:23,411
SHE REALLY WAS A TERRIFIC 

2837
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:24,144
EXPERT, SUSAN MacMANUS. 

2838
01:31:24,144 --> 01:31:25,413
SUSAN WAS SUGGESTING, THIS IS A 

2839
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:26,681
REAL STRUGGLE FOR PEOPLE WHO 

2840
01:31:26,681 --> 01:31:28,115
ARE IN THE REAL CENTER. 

2841
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:28,816
DO THEY GO LEFT? 

2842
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:30,451
OR DO THEY GO RIGHT? 

2843
01:31:30,451 --> 01:31:32,987
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO MIDDLE. 

2844
01:31:32,987 --> 01:31:33,955
>> SO I'M CURIOUS. 

2845
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:35,956
WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS OF 

2846
01:31:35,956 --> 01:31:37,324
THAT KIND OF A MATCHUP WHERE 

2847
01:31:37,324 --> 01:31:38,426
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE 

2848
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:40,928
CANDIDATES WHO ARE NOT CLOSE TO 

2849
01:31:40,928 --> 01:31:41,228
THE MIDDLE? 

2850
01:31:41,228 --> 01:31:44,365
>> ELAINE, IT FITS OUR MOOD IN 

2851
01:31:44,365 --> 01:31:44,865
THIS COUNTRY PERFECTLY. 

2852
01:31:44,865 --> 01:31:45,832
WE ARE AS POLARIZED AS ANY TIME 

2853
01:31:45,832 --> 01:31:47,401
IN MY LIFETIME. 

2854
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:49,971
I THOUGHT FOR A WHILE THE 

2855
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:51,739
1960s, THE LATE '60s AND EARLY 

2856
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:54,075
'70s WOULD FOREVER BE THE MOST 

2857
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:55,009
POLARIZED PERIOD, AT LEAST 

2858
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,578
WHILE I WAS ON EARTH. 

2859
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:57,911
WELL, WRONG. 

2860
01:31:57,911 --> 01:31:59,246
WE ARE MORE POLARIZED NOW, I 

2861
01:31:59,246 --> 01:32:01,248
THINK, BY A MILE, THAN WE WERE 

2862
01:32:01,248 --> 01:32:01,849
THEN. 

2863
01:32:01,849 --> 01:32:03,116
AND IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THERE 

2864
01:32:03,116 --> 01:32:04,552
IS NO CENTER. 

2865
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:05,853
THE CENTER DOESN'T HOLD. 

2866
01:32:05,853 --> 01:32:07,421
WE USED TO SAY, THE CENTER 

2867
01:32:07,421 --> 01:32:07,655
HOLDS. 

2868
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:10,691
NO, THE CENTER HAS BEEN BLOWN 

2869
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:11,158
APART. 

2870
01:32:11,158 --> 01:32:14,028
AND YOUR CHOICES NOW ARE RIGHT, 

2871
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,731
TRUMPIST, AND LEFT, FILL IN THE 

2872
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:16,964
BLANK. 

2873
01:32:16,964 --> 01:32:18,466
IS IT BERNIE SANDER. 

2874
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:20,133
>> WHO EVERY IS -- WHOEVER IS 

2875
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:20,433
NOMINATED. 

2876
01:32:20,433 --> 01:32:21,568
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE LEFT 

2877
01:32:21,568 --> 01:32:21,935
VERSUS RIGHT. 

2878
01:32:21,935 --> 01:32:22,937
AND THE MIDDLE WILL JUST HAVE 

2879
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,939
TO LIVE WITH IT. 

2880
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:26,407
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT SOME OF 

2881
01:32:26,407 --> 01:32:28,175
THE RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE BEEN 

2882
01:32:28,175 --> 01:32:28,643
DOING. 

2883
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,645
YOU RECENTLY LAUNCHED A MIDTERM 

2884
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:31,979
TRACKING TOOL WITH INSUS. 

2885
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:33,513
WHAT DID YOU FIND -- IPSUS. 

2886
01:32:33,513 --> 01:32:36,217
WHAT DID YOU FIND IN TERMS OF 

2887
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:36,550
HOUSE RACES? 

2888
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:38,953
>> WELL, WITH HOUSE RACES, OF 

2889
01:32:38,953 --> 01:32:40,087
COURSE, SOME ARE NOT WELL-

2890
01:32:40,087 --> 01:32:40,320
FORMED. 

2891
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,889
THEY TEND TO BREAK LATER IN THE 

2892
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:42,322
ELECTION PERIOD. 

2893
01:32:42,322 --> 01:32:43,857
AND WE'VE GOT THE COUPLE OF 

2894
01:32:43,857 --> 01:32:45,660
MONTHS TO GO. 

2895
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:49,864
BUT AS FAR AS SOCIAL MEDIA IS 

2896
01:32:49,864 --> 01:32:50,464
CONCERNED, IT'S INTERESTING. 

2897
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:51,098
BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY CLEAR, 

2898
01:32:51,098 --> 01:32:53,034
AGAIN, THE ENERGY IS ON THE 

2899
01:32:53,034 --> 01:32:54,301
RIGHT AND THE LEFT. 

2900
01:32:54,301 --> 01:32:55,436
THEY'RE PUSHING CANDIDATES ON 

2901
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:57,605
THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT. 

2902
01:32:57,605 --> 01:32:58,673
THE MOPY COMES -- MONEY COMES 

2903
01:32:58,673 --> 01:32:59,573
IN TO THE CANDIDATES ON THE 

2904
01:32:59,573 --> 01:33:01,242
RIGHT AND THE LEFT. 

2905
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:04,412
WE DID ALSO DISCOVER SOMETHING 

2906
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:05,246
INTERESTING. 

2907
01:33:05,246 --> 01:33:08,082
AND I GIVE FULL CREDIT TO IPSUS 

2908
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:09,250
FOR THIS. 

2909
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,485
THEY HAVE A WAY, A VERY CAREFUL 

2910
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:13,154
WAY OF PRESENTING WHAT 

2911
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:14,522
PERCENTAGE OF SOCIAL MEDIA FOR 

2912
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:16,957
EACH CANDIDATE IS GENERATED BY 

2913
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:17,157
BOTS. 

2914
01:33:17,157 --> 01:33:18,626
BY THESE ROBOTS ON TWITTER. 

2915
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:21,295
AND IT'S QUITE REMARKABLE. 

2916
01:33:21,295 --> 01:33:22,663
YOU CAN HAVE A DECENT 

2917
01:33:22,663 --> 01:33:24,965
PERCENTAGE -- IT'S GENERALLY IN 

2918
01:33:24,965 --> 01:33:25,398
THE SINGLE DIGITS. 

2919
01:33:25,398 --> 01:33:27,101
BUT WHEN YOU THINK OF THE 

2920
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,136
MILLIONS OF TWEETS INVOLVED, 

2921
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:29,636
IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. 

2922
01:33:29,636 --> 01:33:32,607
>> WHAT ABOUT THE SENATE AND 

2923
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:32,974
GOVERNOR RACES? 

2924
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:34,175
>> WELL, THE SENATE -- OF 

2925
01:33:34,175 --> 01:33:35,342
COURSE, DEPENDS ON THE MAP THAT 

2926
01:33:35,342 --> 01:33:37,244
IS UP IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. 

2927
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:39,580
AND WE'VE GONE BACK AND LOOKED 

2928
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,315
AT EVERY SINGLE SENATE MAP FROM 

2929
01:33:41,315 --> 01:33:42,516
THE BEGINNING OF POPULAR 

2930
01:33:42,516 --> 01:33:44,418
ELECTION AT THE BEGINNING OF 

2931
01:33:44,418 --> 01:33:47,154
THE 20th CENTURY TO THE 

2932
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:47,722
PRESENT. 

2933
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:50,558
THIS IS ARGUABLY, THE WORST MAP 

2934
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:51,725
FOR EITHER PARTY EVER. 

2935
01:33:51,725 --> 01:33:53,160
AND OF COURSE, IT'S THE WORST 

2936
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,864
MAP FOR THE DEMOCRATS. 

2937
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,731
THEY ARE TREMENDOUSLY EXPOSED, 

2938
01:33:57,731 --> 01:33:59,533
BECAUSE THEY HAVE 26 OF THE 

2939
01:33:59,533 --> 01:33:59,933
SENATE SEATS UP. 

2940
01:33:59,933 --> 01:34:01,535
ONLY A THIRD OF THE SENATES 

2941
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:02,903
ELECTED. 

2942
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,272
AND 10 OF THEM ARE IN STATES 

2943
01:34:05,272 --> 01:34:07,241
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WON BY 

2944
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,977
MARGINS UP TO OVER 40%. 

2945
01:34:09,977 --> 01:34:11,678
IT WILL BE A MIRACLE, IF 

2946
01:34:11,678 --> 01:34:13,247
DEMOCRATS TAKE THE SENATE. 

2947
01:34:13,247 --> 01:34:15,182
IT IS AT LEAST AS POSSIBLE, 

2948
01:34:15,182 --> 01:34:16,684
MAYBE MORE POSSIBLE, THAT THE 

2949
01:34:16,684 --> 01:34:18,986
REPUBLICANS WILL ADD SEATS IN 

2950
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:19,353
THE SENATE. 

2951
01:34:19,353 --> 01:34:21,255
SO IN THAT SENSE, PRESIDENT 

2952
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:24,692
TRUMP, FOR HIS SUPREME COURT 

2953
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:26,027
NOMINATIONS, OR CABINET 

2954
01:34:26,027 --> 01:34:27,294
NOMINATIONS, LOWER COURT JUDGE 

2955
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:29,330
NOMINATIONS, MIGHT END UP IN AS 

2956
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,998
GOOD OR EVEN BETTER SHAPE, EVEN 

2957
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:33,067
IF HE LOSES THE HOUSE OF 

2958
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:34,068
REPRESENTATIVES, WHICH I THINK 

2959
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,569
IS SLIGHTLY PROBABLE RIGHT NOW. 

2960
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:37,171
YOU'D HAVE TO CALL THE 

2961
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,706
DEMOCRATS AT LEAST SOFT 

2962
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:39,506
FAVORITES FOR THE HOUSE. 

2963
01:34:39,506 --> 01:34:41,509
THOUGH THAT COULD CHANGE BY 

2964
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:41,776
NOVEMBER. 

2965
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:42,476
>> WHAT ABOUT ISSUES, LARRY? 

2966
01:34:42,476 --> 01:34:44,612
WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT 

2967
01:34:44,612 --> 01:34:45,245
ISSUES TO VOTERS THIS ELECTION 

2968
01:34:45,245 --> 01:34:47,915
CYCLE? 

2969
01:34:47,915 --> 01:34:50,017
>> WELL, THANKS TO OUR FRIENDS 

2970
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,287
AT IPSOS AND THE MODELS THAT WE 

2971
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:56,290
HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTING FOR THIS 

2972
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:57,157
NEW POLITICAL ATLAS. 

2973
01:34:57,157 --> 01:34:57,591
THAT'S CLEAR. 

2974
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:59,093
FOR THE REPUBLICANS, THE 

2975
01:34:59,093 --> 01:35:00,361
LEADING ISSUE BY A MILE IS 

2976
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:01,562
IMMIGRATION. 

2977
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:02,830
IN OTHER WORDS, THE REPUBLICAN 

2978
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:04,732
PARTY TODAY, WHICH IS THE TRUMP 

2979
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:06,333
PARTY, IT'S NOT THE OLD 

2980
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,200
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

2981
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:08,235
IT'S THE TRUMP PARTY. 

2982
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:10,538
THEY LISTEN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

2983
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:11,005
HE PROBABLY STRESSES 

2984
01:35:11,005 --> 01:35:12,740
IMMIGRATION MORE THAN ANY OTHER 

2985
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:12,973
ISSUE. 

2986
01:35:12,973 --> 01:35:14,041
IT PROBABLY HELPED HIM TO GET 

2987
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:17,244
ELECTED MORE THAN ANY OTHER 

2988
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:18,479
ISSUE. 

2989
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:19,146
FOR THE DEMOCRATS, 

2990
01:35:19,146 --> 01:35:20,548
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, THE TOP 

2991
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:21,548
ISSUE IS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE. 

2992
01:35:21,548 --> 01:35:24,285
IT'S DONALD TRUMP. 

2993
01:35:24,285 --> 01:35:25,352
DONALD TRUMP MOTIVATES 

2994
01:35:25,352 --> 01:35:26,587
DEMOCRATS MORE THAN ANY SINGLE 

2995
01:35:26,587 --> 01:35:26,820
ISSUE. 

2996
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,456
THOUGH IF YOU HAD TO PICK ONE, 

2997
01:35:29,456 --> 01:35:29,990
YOU'D PICK HEALTHCARE. 

2998
01:35:29,990 --> 01:35:32,126
THAT SEEMS TO BE THE ISSUE, 

2999
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:33,527
ISSUE, THEY'RE MOST CONCERNED 

3000
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:33,760
ABOUT. 

3001
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:34,327
BUT THEY ARE MOTIVATED BY 

3002
01:35:34,327 --> 01:35:36,230
DONALD TRUMP IN THE SENSE THAT 

3003
01:35:36,230 --> 01:35:38,632
THEY WANT TO GET OUT AND VOTE 

3004
01:35:38,632 --> 01:35:39,532
AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BY 

3005
01:35:39,532 --> 01:35:41,235
ELECTING A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS. 

3006
01:35:41,235 --> 01:35:42,435
>> AND SO GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST 

3007
01:35:42,435 --> 01:35:44,572
LAID OUT THERE. 

3008
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:47,741
HAS MUCH CHANGED IN THE WAY OF 

3009
01:35:47,741 --> 01:35:49,409
HOW VOTERS FEEL WITH RESPECT TO 

3010
01:35:49,409 --> 01:35:52,812
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S APPROVAL 

3011
01:35:52,812 --> 01:35:53,046
RATING? 

3012
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:54,614
>> IT'S BEEN REMARKABLY STABLE. 

3013
01:35:54,614 --> 01:35:56,851
HE HAD A ROUGH FIRST FEW 

3014
01:35:56,851 --> 01:35:58,285
MONTHS, REALLY HALF A YEAR, 

3015
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:01,221
MAYBE LONGER THAN HALF A YEAR. 

3016
01:36:01,221 --> 01:36:01,856
BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED? 

3017
01:36:01,856 --> 01:36:03,623
BECAUSE THE ECONOMY HAS BEEN 

3018
01:36:03,623 --> 01:36:03,823
GOOD. 

3019
01:36:03,823 --> 01:36:06,327
BECAUSE TRUMP HAS ACHIEVED SOME 

3020
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:07,027
OF HIS GOALS. 

3021
01:36:07,027 --> 01:36:08,462
IT SATISFIED THE 46% OF 

3022
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:10,431
AMERICANS WHO VOTED FOR HIM. 

3023
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:12,299
OF COURSE, HIS BASE, WHICH IS 

3024
01:36:12,299 --> 01:36:13,934
SOMEWHERE AROUND 35% OF THE 

3025
01:36:13,934 --> 01:36:16,237
WHOLE COUNTRY, WOULD HAVE BEEN 

3026
01:36:16,237 --> 01:36:17,438
ENTHUSIASTIC IF HE HADN'T 

3027
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,105
SUCCESS SUCCEEDED IN ANYTHING. 

3028
01:36:19,105 --> 01:36:21,142
THEY WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN FOR 

3029
01:36:21,142 --> 01:36:22,809
TRUMP, FOR REPUBLICANS FOR THE 

3030
01:36:22,809 --> 01:36:23,043
PARTY. 

3031
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:25,346
BUT WHAT TRUMP HAS BEEN AGE TO 

3032
01:36:25,346 --> 01:36:27,014
-- ABLE TO DO IS TO ADD BACK 

3033
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:28,349
INTO THE MIX, THE ADDITIONAL 

3034
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:30,084
PERCENTAGE POINTS THAT GOT HIM 

3035
01:36:30,084 --> 01:36:30,517
UP TO 46. 

3036
01:36:30,517 --> 01:36:31,752
AND EVEN THOUGH HE LOST THE 

3037
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:36,323
POPULAR VOTE AS WE KNOW, HE WON 

3038
01:36:36,323 --> 01:36:36,923
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE. 

3039
01:36:36,923 --> 01:36:38,526
SO HE IS ABOUT WHERE HE WAS ON 

3040
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:38,859
ELECTION DAY. 

3041
01:36:38,859 --> 01:36:41,762
I DOUBT HE GOES ANY FURTHER OR 

3042
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:42,095
MUCH FURTHER. 

3043
01:36:42,095 --> 01:36:43,564
I DOUBT HE'S A MAJORITY PRESENT 

3044
01:36:43,564 --> 01:36:44,465
EVER. 

3045
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,066
BUT HE'S GOT ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN 

3046
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:47,835
HIS PRESIDENCY, AND GIVEN WHO 

3047
01:36:47,835 --> 01:36:49,737
THE DEMOCRATS MAY NOMINATE, 

3048
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:50,670
PERHAPS TO WIN RE-ELECTION. 

3049
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:52,472
>> SO WE KNOW, LARRY, THAT THE 

3050
01:36:52,472 --> 01:36:53,240
PRESIDENT SUGGESTED THAT THERE 

3051
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,742
WOULD BE VIOLENCE, IF THE GOP 

3052
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:56,709
WERE TO LOSE IN THE MIDTERMS. 

3053
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:58,378
I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU 

3054
01:36:58,378 --> 01:37:00,080
MAKE OF THOSE REMARKS FROM THE 

3055
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:00,380
PRESIDENT? 

3056
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:02,916
>> OH, I THINK THEY'RE JUST 

3057
01:37:02,916 --> 01:37:03,250
NONSENSICAL. 

3058
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,886
WHO KNOWS WHERE HE WAS GOING OR 

3059
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:06,553
WHY HE SAID IT. 

3060
01:37:06,553 --> 01:37:08,055
HE SAYS SO MANY THINGS THAT 

3061
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:11,926
TURN OUT NOT TO BE TRUE, OR 

3062
01:37:11,926 --> 01:37:13,928
WHICH THERE IS NO FACTUAL 

3063
01:37:13,928 --> 01:37:14,161
BASIS. 

3064
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:15,595
THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS. 

3065
01:37:15,595 --> 01:37:16,497
YOU COULD POSTULATE THAT THERE 

3066
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:19,099
IS GOING TO BE VIOLENCE, 

3067
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:19,466
UNFORTUNATELY. 

3068
01:37:19,466 --> 01:37:20,234
AND I HOPE IT ISN'T TRUE. 

3069
01:37:20,234 --> 01:37:22,836
BUT THERE COULD BE VIOLENCE, AS 

3070
01:37:22,836 --> 01:37:25,039
WE CONTINUE ALONG THIS 

3071
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:25,406
POLARIZED PATH. 

3072
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:26,639
THE MORE POLARIZED WE GET, THE 

3073
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,144
MORE LIKELY THERE IS TO BE 

3074
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:30,544
VIOLENCE, THOUGH. 

3075
01:37:30,544 --> 01:37:32,212
MAYBE THAT'S MY PERSPECTIVE, 

3076
01:37:32,212 --> 01:37:33,247
LIVING IN CHARLOTTESVILLE. 

3077
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:34,882
>> ALL RIGHT. 

3078
01:37:34,882 --> 01:37:35,382
EXCELLENT POINT THERE. 

3079
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:37,251
LARRY SABATO, THANK YOU SO MUCH 

3080
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:37,751
FO YOUR TIME. 

3081
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:39,987
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. 

3082
01:37:39,987 --> 01:37:40,454
>> THANK YOU, ELAINE. 

3083
01:37:40,454 --> 01:37:42,623
>>> GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

3084
01:37:42,623 --> 01:37:42,856
BREAK. 

3085
01:37:42,856 --> 01:37:45,259
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE PRIMARY 

3086
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:46,326
NIGHT COVERAGE, WHEN WE RETURN. 

3087
01:37:46,326 --> 01:37:49,063
INCLUDING A LOOK AT CONCERNS 

3088
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:49,563
ABOUT ELECTION HACKING. 

3089
01:37:49,563 --> 01:37:50,598
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

3090
01:40:17,277 --> 01:40:17,577
>>> HELLO. 

3091
01:40:17,577 --> 01:40:19,546
I'M BILL WHITAKER, WITH "60 

3092
01:40:19,546 --> 01:40:19,880
MINUTES." 

3093
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:21,448
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 

3094
01:40:21,448 --> 01:40:21,881
CONGRESSMAN MORENO. 

3095
01:40:21,881 --> 01:40:23,117
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS 

3096
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:23,717
OUT OF CONTROL. 

3097
01:40:23,717 --> 01:40:24,551
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 

3098
01:40:24,551 --> 01:40:27,821
PEOPLE DIE. 

3099
01:40:27,821 --> 01:40:29,923
>> WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN 

3100
01:40:29,923 --> 01:40:30,456
ABOUT THIS WITHOUT "60 

3101
01:40:30,456 --> 01:40:31,759
MINUTES." 

3102
01:40:31,759 --> 01:40:32,826
>> I DID SEE THE REPORT. 

3103
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:34,228
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE 

3104
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:34,461
REPORT. 

3105
01:40:34,461 --> 01:40:36,363
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY 

3106
01:40:36,363 --> 01:40:38,699
SERIOUSLY. 

3107
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:40,334
>> THEY WERE JUST DRUG DEALERS 

3108
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:40,734
IN LAB COATS. 

3109
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:41,968
>> YOU KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 

3110
01:40:41,968 --> 01:40:45,239
PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 

3111
01:40:45,239 --> 01:40:46,840
>>> ELECTION HACKING BECAME A 

3112
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,142
HOT TOPIC IN FLORIDA'S PRIMARY, 

3113
01:40:48,142 --> 01:40:50,611
AFTER A REPORT OF AN 11-YEAR-

3114
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:52,779
OLD MANAGING TO HACK A REPLICA 

3115
01:40:52,779 --> 01:40:55,115
OF A FLORIDA WEBSITE -- VOTING 

3116
01:40:55,115 --> 01:40:56,082
WEBSITE, EARLIER THIS MONTH. 

3117
01:40:56,082 --> 01:40:57,151
BUT FLORIDA ELECTION OFFICIALS 

3118
01:40:57,151 --> 01:40:59,119
ARE PUSHING BACK AGAINST THAT 

3119
01:40:59,119 --> 01:40:59,352
REPORT. 

3120
01:40:59,352 --> 01:41:01,221
JOINING ME NOW TO TALK ABOUT 

3121
01:41:01,221 --> 01:41:02,422
THIS IS DAN PATTERSON. 

3122
01:41:02,422 --> 01:41:04,291
HE'S THE SENIOR PRODUCER FOR 

3123
01:41:04,291 --> 01:41:05,259
CNET AND CBS NEWS. 

3124
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:06,025
DAN, BREAK THIS DOWN FOR US. 

3125
01:41:06,025 --> 01:41:09,563
BECAUSE THIS WAS COMING OUT OF 

3126
01:41:09,563 --> 01:41:10,297
THIS HACKING CONFERENCE, KNOWN 

3127
01:41:10,297 --> 01:41:12,599
AS DEF CON, WHERE YOU HAD AN 11-

3128
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:13,834
YEAR-OLD, WHO HACKED WHAT WAS 

3129
01:41:13,834 --> 01:41:16,103
ALLEGED TO BE A REPLICA OF A 

3130
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:17,103
FLORIDA VOTING WEBSITE. 

3131
01:41:17,103 --> 01:41:18,939
WHAT'S THE REAL STORY HERE? 

3132
01:41:18,939 --> 01:41:19,206
>> YEAH. 

3133
01:41:19,206 --> 01:41:22,543
SO THIS WAS A REPLICA OF A SITE 

3134
01:41:22,543 --> 01:41:24,044
THAT RESEMBLED THE FLORIDA 

3135
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:24,311
WEBSITE. 

3136
01:41:24,311 --> 01:41:26,447
AND IT WAS INTENDED AS A 

3137
01:41:26,447 --> 01:41:27,581
DEMPISTRATION OF -- 

3138
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:30,150
DEMONSTRATION OF HOW EASY IT IS 

3139
01:41:30,150 --> 01:41:30,717
TO HACK SOME WEBSITES. 

3140
01:41:30,717 --> 01:41:32,086
THE CONFUSION HERE CAME WITH 

3141
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,186
THE USE OF THE FLORIDA WEBSITE. 

3142
01:41:33,186 --> 01:41:35,489
SO WE TALKED TO THE STATE OF 

3143
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:36,190
FLORIDA. 

3144
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:37,291
AND THEY PUSHED BACK PRETTY 

3145
01:41:37,291 --> 01:41:37,491
HARD. 

3146
01:41:37,491 --> 01:41:38,425
UNDERSTANDABLY. 

3147
01:41:38,425 --> 01:41:40,761
SO THIS WAS A WEBSITE THAT WAS 

3148
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:43,063
DESIGNED TO LOOK AND FEEL AS 

3149
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:44,965
THOUGH IT WAS FLORIDA. 

3150
01:41:44,965 --> 01:41:46,833
BUT IT WAS NOT CONNECTED TO ANY 

3151
01:41:46,833 --> 01:41:47,233
FLORIDA SYSTEMS. 

3152
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:49,002
AND IN FACT, THE STATE OF 

3153
01:41:49,002 --> 01:41:51,071
FLORIDA SAID THAT LOOK, WE 

3154
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:52,473
WOULD BE CRAZY -- I'M 

3155
01:41:52,473 --> 01:41:53,140
PARAPHRASING A LITTLE BIT HERE. 

3156
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:55,008
BUT WE WOULD BE CRAZY TO NOT 

3157
01:41:55,008 --> 01:41:56,777
ONLY GIVE OUR WEBSITE FOR A 

3158
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:57,244
DEMONSTRATION. 

3159
01:41:57,244 --> 01:41:59,847
BUT TO CONNECT OUR WEBSITES TO 

3160
01:41:59,847 --> 01:42:01,248
THE DATABASES AND OTHER 

3161
01:42:01,248 --> 01:42:02,082
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT 

3162
01:42:02,082 --> 01:42:04,051
POWERS OUR VOTING SYSTEMS. 

3163
01:42:04,051 --> 01:42:06,186
SO IT'S AN EASY HEADLINE. 

3164
01:42:06,186 --> 01:42:09,690
IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND 

3165
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:10,290
WHY DEMONSTRATIONS CAN BE 

3166
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:10,624
MISCONSTRUED. 

3167
01:42:10,624 --> 01:42:16,130
BUT THE USE OF THE STATE OF 

3168
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,164
FLORIDA FOR THIS HACKING 

3169
01:42:17,164 --> 01:42:20,867
DEMONSTRATION, BOARDED -- 

3170
01:42:20,867 --> 01:42:21,467
BORDERED ON IRRESPONSIBLE. 

3171
01:42:21,467 --> 01:42:23,604
>> WHART IMPATIONS -- WHAT ARE 

3172
01:42:23,604 --> 01:42:24,304
THE IMPLICATIONS OF SOMETHING 

3173
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:25,839
LIKE THAT HAPPENING. 

3174
01:42:25,839 --> 01:42:26,673
WHAT ARE THE BROADER 

3175
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:27,006
IMPLICATIONS. 

3176
01:42:27,006 --> 01:42:28,775
>> YOU SAID THE RIGHT WORDS 

3177
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:29,008
THERE. 

3178
01:42:29,008 --> 01:42:33,647
WE ARE RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT NOT 

3179
01:42:33,647 --> 01:42:36,149
JUST RUSSIAN METTLING. 

3180
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:37,151
BUT IRANIAN METTLING. 

3181
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:39,386
THE -- MEDDLING, THE NORTH 

3182
01:42:39,386 --> 01:42:39,653
KOREANS. 

3183
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:41,121
EVERYONE IS PAYING ATTENTION TO 

3184
01:42:41,121 --> 01:42:43,123
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDDLING, 

3185
01:42:43,123 --> 01:42:47,227
WHETHER IT'S FROM ACTUAL 

3186
01:42:47,227 --> 01:42:48,095
DATABASE TAMPERING TO CRITICAL 

3187
01:42:48,095 --> 01:42:48,662
INFRASTRUCTURE TAMPERING. 

3188
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:49,296
EVERYBODY IS LOOKING AT THIS 

3189
01:42:49,296 --> 01:42:51,598
NOW, AND THROWING UP RED FLAGS 

3190
01:42:51,598 --> 01:42:53,900
LIKE THIS PUTS US ON KIND OF A 

3191
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,369
SCARE ALERT THAT IS NOT ONLY 

3192
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:57,170
UNNECESSARY, BUT IT DISTRACTS 

3193
01:42:57,170 --> 01:42:58,238
FROM THE REAL CHALLENGES THAT 

3194
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:00,607
DO ACTUALLY EXIST IN THE CYBER 

3195
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:01,575
AND POLITICAL ECOSYSTEM. 

3196
01:43:01,575 --> 01:43:02,776
>> SO ONE OF THE STORY LINES 

3197
01:43:02,776 --> 01:43:05,645
THAT I HAD READ IN FLORIDA. 

3198
01:43:05,645 --> 01:43:07,714
ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE 

3199
01:43:07,714 --> 01:43:08,515
DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT SENATOR, 

3200
01:43:08,515 --> 01:43:10,150
BILL NELSON, WHO REPORTEDLY 

3201
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:12,052
SAID THAT RUSSIAN OPERATIVES 

3202
01:43:12,052 --> 01:43:13,453
HAD TARGETED FLORIDA VOTING 

3203
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:14,221
SYSTEMS, AHEAD OF TONIGHT'S 

3204
01:43:14,221 --> 01:43:14,521
PRIMARIES. 

3205
01:43:14,521 --> 01:43:16,055
AND THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD THE 

3206
01:43:16,055 --> 01:43:18,458
TAMPA BAY TIMES. 

3207
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:18,691
QUOTE. 

3208
01:43:18,691 --> 01:43:19,292
THEY HAVE ALREADY PENETRATED 

3209
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:20,627
CERTAIN COUNTIES IN THE STATE. 

3210
01:43:20,627 --> 01:43:23,597
AND THEY NOW HAVE FREE REIGN TO 

3211
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:23,897
MOVE ABOUT. 

3212
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:25,699
SO DAN. 

3213
01:43:25,699 --> 01:43:26,399
WHAT'S THE EVIDENCE? 

3214
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:27,968
WAS THERE ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE 

3215
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:29,870
TO SUPPORT THESE CLAIMS? 

3216
01:43:29,870 --> 01:43:31,938
>> THE CLAIMS FROM NELSON ARE 

3217
01:43:31,938 --> 01:43:33,139
-- THERE IS ZERO EVIDENCE TO 

3218
01:43:33,139 --> 01:43:33,473
SUPPORT THIS. 

3219
01:43:33,473 --> 01:43:36,843
AND ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS A 

3220
01:43:36,843 --> 01:43:37,878
REALLY, REALLY CHALLENGING 

3221
01:43:37,878 --> 01:43:39,579
THING FOR HIM TO ASSERT. 

3222
01:43:39,579 --> 01:43:41,782
BECAUSE AGAIN, RUSSIAN ACTORS 

3223
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,350
AND OTHER FOREIGN ADVERSARIES 

3224
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:45,152
ARE TAMPERING WITH OUR SYSTEMS, 

3225
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:46,753
WITH MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF 

3226
01:43:46,753 --> 01:43:47,020
SYSTEMS. 

3227
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:48,922
BUT TO ALLEGE THIS WITHOUT ANY 

3228
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:50,190
TYPE OF EVIDENCE, AGAIN, MAKES 

3229
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:52,326
THE CYBER WORLD FEEL AS THOUGH 

3230
01:43:52,326 --> 01:43:55,062
WE ARE WORKING ON VERY SERIOUS 

3231
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,463
FORENSIC EVIDENCE TO TRACK THE 

3232
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:57,264
ACTUAL MEDDLING THAT IS 

3233
01:43:57,264 --> 01:43:58,765
HAPPENING. 

3234
01:43:58,765 --> 01:44:01,100
AND WHEN WE CONFUSE THAT 

3235
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:01,400
ECOSYSTEM. 

3236
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,204
WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIVISION 

3237
01:44:04,204 --> 01:44:05,272
AND THE DISTRUST OF 

3238
01:44:05,272 --> 01:44:06,473
ORGANIZATIONS AND OF 

3239
01:44:06,473 --> 01:44:07,274
INSTITUTIONS THAT IS ALREADY 

3240
01:44:07,274 --> 01:44:09,242
PERCOLATING UP TO THE SURFACE 

3241
01:44:09,242 --> 01:44:09,542
RIGHT NOW. 

3242
01:44:09,542 --> 01:44:09,842
>> RIGHT. 

3243
01:44:09,842 --> 01:44:10,510
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE 

3244
01:44:10,510 --> 01:44:12,246
WHO ARE QUESTIONING WHAT IS 

3245
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:13,914
SORT OF REAL, WHAT'S NOT REAL. 

3246
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:16,116
BUT YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE 

3247
01:44:16,116 --> 01:44:18,085
WATCHING THIS, IS THIS THREAT 

3248
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:18,784
OF ELECTION HACKING SOMETHING 

3249
01:44:18,784 --> 01:44:22,055
THAT THEY SHOULD REALLY BE 

3250
01:44:22,055 --> 01:44:22,455
CONCERNED ABOUT? 

3251
01:44:22,455 --> 01:44:22,722
>> YES. 

3252
01:44:22,722 --> 01:44:23,623
ELECTION MEDDLING, ELECTION 

3253
01:44:23,623 --> 01:44:25,192
HACKING, AND TAMPERING, IS 

3254
01:44:25,192 --> 01:44:26,893

01:51:12,065 --> 01:51:14,834
WELL KNOWN TO YOUR VIEWERS AS 

3437
01:51:14,834 --> 01:51:16,670
AMERICA'S TOUGHEST SHERIFF. 

3438
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,537
ENDED HIS CAREER IN DISGRACE. 

3439
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:20,340
ENDED UP BEING KNOCKED OUT BY 

3440
01:51:20,340 --> 01:51:22,742
THE VOTERS IN MARICOPA COUNTY. 

3441
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:24,010
THEN ALSO, CONVICTED AND LATER 

3442
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:27,547
PARDONED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR 

3443
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:28,481
VIOLATIONS OF A COURT ORDER. 

3444
01:51:28,481 --> 01:51:29,783
>> AND IT'S INTERESTING. 

3445
01:51:29,783 --> 01:51:31,885
ALL THREE OF THOSE CANDIDATES 

3446
01:51:31,885 --> 01:51:32,986
HAVE EMBRACED PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

3447
01:51:32,986 --> 01:51:35,188
AND YET HE HAS NOT EPIDORSED 

3448
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:37,223
ANY OF -- NOT ENDORSED ANY OF 

3449
01:51:37,223 --> 01:51:37,457
THEM. 

3450
01:51:37,457 --> 01:51:40,059
TELL US ABOUT THAT. 

3451
01:51:40,059 --> 01:51:41,361
>> YEAH, MARTHA McSALLY, BEFORE 

3452
01:51:41,361 --> 01:51:43,930
SHE GOT INVOLVED IN RUNNING FOR 

3453
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:45,698
THE STATEWIDE SEAT, SERVED A 

3454
01:51:45,698 --> 01:51:47,567
VERY COMPETITIVE DISTRICT HERE 

3455
01:51:47,567 --> 01:51:48,767
IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA. 

3456
01:51:48,767 --> 01:51:50,103
AND ACTUALLY KEPT HER DISTANCE 

3457
01:51:50,103 --> 01:51:50,570
FROM DONALD TRUMP. 

3458
01:51:50,570 --> 01:51:53,239
DID NOT SAY IF SHE WOULD VOTE 

3459
01:51:53,239 --> 01:51:53,840
FOR HIM. 

3460
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,575
DID NOT ENDORSE HIM. 

3461
01:51:55,575 --> 01:51:58,411
CONDEMNED HIM AFTER THE ACCESS 

3462
01:51:58,411 --> 01:51:59,212
HOLLYWOOD TAPE EMERGED IN 2016. 

3463
01:51:59,212 --> 01:52:02,115
BUT SINCE HER PLANS TO RUN FOR 

3464
01:52:02,115 --> 01:52:03,750
STATEWIDE U.S. SENATE HAS 

3465
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:04,684
GOTTEN CLOSE TO DONALD TRUMP. 

3466
01:52:04,684 --> 01:52:05,718
HE SAID VERY NICE THINGS ABOUT 

3467
01:52:05,718 --> 01:52:05,918
HER. 

3468
01:52:05,918 --> 01:52:08,354
SHE WAS THERE FOR THE SIGNING 

3469
01:52:08,354 --> 01:52:09,122
OF THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION 

3470
01:52:09,122 --> 01:52:10,790
BILL RECENTLY. 

3471
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:13,727
BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS KIND OF 

3472
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:14,928
STEERED CLEAR OF MAKING HIS 

3473
01:52:14,928 --> 01:52:16,396
ENDORSEMENT IN THIS RACE. 

3474
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:19,532
HE HAS OBVIOUSLY HAD A LONG AND 

3475
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:22,902
TIGHT ALLIANCE WITH JOE ARPAIO. 

3476
01:52:22,902 --> 01:52:24,838
AND KELLY WARD IS ALSO REALLY 

3477
01:52:24,838 --> 01:52:27,874
SOUGHT HIS APPROVAL FOR 

3478
01:52:27,874 --> 01:52:28,841
WHATEVER REASON, HE'S KIND. 

3479
01:52:28,841 --> 01:52:29,776
STEERED CLEAR OF SAYING 

3480
01:52:29,776 --> 01:52:31,678
ANYTHING TO ANY OF THESE GUYS. 

3481
01:52:31,678 --> 01:52:32,712
>> LET'S TALK DEMOCRATS. 

3482
01:52:32,712 --> 01:52:34,447
LAST TIME A DEMOCRAT WAS 

3483
01:52:34,447 --> 01:52:36,850
ELECTED TO THE U.S. ARIZONA 

3484
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:37,951
SENATE, WAS 1988. 

3485
01:52:37,951 --> 01:52:40,320
WHO ARE THE DEMOCRATIC 

3486
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:40,620
CANDIDATES? 

3487
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:43,689
AND WHAT ARE THEIR CHANCES? 

3488
01:52:43,689 --> 01:52:47,527
>> THERE'S A CONGRESSWOMAN OUT 

3489
01:52:47,527 --> 01:52:48,895
OF PHOENIX, NAMED KIRSTEN 

3490
01:52:48,895 --> 01:52:49,128
CINEMA. 

3491
01:52:49,128 --> 01:52:52,065
SHE IS A DEMOCRAT WHO HAS VOTED 

3492
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:53,233
ALONGSIDE REPUBLICANS IN A 

3493
01:52:53,233 --> 01:52:54,701
BIPARTISAN FASHION IN RECENT 

3494
01:52:54,701 --> 01:52:55,969
YEARS, I THINK PROBABLY 

3495
01:52:55,969 --> 01:52:57,604
PREPPING HERSELF FOR THIS 

3496
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:58,037
STATEWIDE RACE. 

3497
01:52:58,037 --> 01:53:00,607
RIGHT NOW, POLLS SHOW HER 

3498
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:03,443
LEADING ALL THREE OF THOSE 

3499
01:53:03,443 --> 01:53:04,244
REPUBLIAN CANDIDATES. 

3500
01:53:04,244 --> 01:53:05,678
BUT THAT'S A SPLIT FIELD. 

3501
01:53:05,678 --> 01:53:08,681
AND I THINK LIKELY, MARTHA 

3502
01:53:08,681 --> 01:53:10,083
McSALLY'S EMERGENCE IN THIS 

3503
01:53:10,083 --> 01:53:13,253
RACE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE 

3504
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:14,554
REPUBLICANS COALLEYSING BEHIND 

3505
01:53:14,554 --> 01:53:14,921
HER. 

3506
01:53:14,921 --> 01:53:15,988
PEOPLE SAY, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING 

3507
01:53:15,988 --> 01:53:17,890
TO -- ARIZONA IS A PURPLE 

3508
01:53:17,890 --> 01:53:18,291
STATE. 

3509
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:22,362
AND DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO 

3510
01:53:22,362 --> 01:53:22,996
START WINNING STATEWIDE AGAIN. 

3511
01:53:22,996 --> 01:53:25,064
I'LL IN A -- I'M IN A POSITION 

3512
01:53:25,064 --> 01:53:29,135
WHERE I WILL BELIEVE IT WHEN I 

3513
01:53:29,135 --> 01:53:29,368
SEE IT. 

3514
01:53:29,368 --> 01:53:30,570
>> MARTHMARTHA McSALLY IS 

3515
01:53:30,570 --> 01:53:32,271
ALREADY IN AN AD. 

3516
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:33,139
>> I'M LEADING SECURITY. 

3517
01:53:33,139 --> 01:53:34,774
WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP TO 

3518
01:53:34,774 --> 01:53:38,144
DO EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DO IN 

3519
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:38,544
OUR CAN COUNTRY. 

3520
01:53:38,544 --> 01:53:39,611
>> I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT 

3521
01:53:39,611 --> 01:53:40,880
THING IS, I SUPPORT THE 

3522
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:41,681
PRESIDENT AND ALWAYS HAVE. 

3523
01:53:41,681 --> 01:53:48,454
>> I SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT FROM 

3524
01:53:48,454 --> 01:53:48,688
DAY 1. 

3525
01:53:48,688 --> 01:53:50,422
>> THAT WAS THE WRONG SOUND. 

3526
01:53:50,422 --> 01:53:51,991
BUT THAT WAS WHAT WE WERE 

3527
01:53:51,991 --> 01:53:52,591
TALKING ABOUT A MOMENT AGO. 

3528
01:53:52,591 --> 01:53:54,360
THAT IS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. 

3529
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:55,561
YOU HAVE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE 

3530
01:53:55,561 --> 01:53:56,662
VERY MUCH RUSHED TO EMBRACE 

3531
01:53:56,662 --> 01:53:57,163
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

3532
01:53:57,163 --> 01:53:59,265
SINCE WE JUST HEARD THAT. 

3533
01:53:59,265 --> 01:54:00,400
LET ME REDIRECT MY QUESTION, 

3534
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,969
BACK TO WHAT WE JUST HEARD 

3535
01:54:02,969 --> 01:54:03,202
THERE. 

3536
01:54:03,202 --> 01:54:04,804
HOW DIFFICULT WILL IT BE, GIVEN 

3537
01:54:04,804 --> 01:54:06,539
WHAT WE JUST HEARD THERE? 

3538
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:11,077
GIVEN HOW THEY TRIED TO TACK 

3539
01:54:11,077 --> 01:54:13,146
TRY TO THE RIGHT FOR THE 

3540
01:54:13,146 --> 01:54:14,847
EVENTUAL VICTOR THERE ON THE 

3541
01:54:14,847 --> 01:54:15,080
RIGHT. 

3542
01:54:15,080 --> 01:54:16,382
FOR A FAIR AND GENERAL ELECTION 

3543
01:54:16,382 --> 01:54:18,317
IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA? 

3544
01:54:18,317 --> 01:54:19,819
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. 

3545
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:21,087
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO 

3546
01:54:21,087 --> 01:54:22,655
FIND THE ANSWERS OUT TO IN 

3547
01:54:22,655 --> 01:54:22,922
NOVEMBER. 

3548
01:54:22,922 --> 01:54:24,423
BUT I THINK WHAT IS REALLY 

3549
01:54:24,423 --> 01:54:27,427
INTERESTING THERE IS HOW MUCH 

3550
01:54:27,427 --> 01:54:28,494
MARTHA McSALLY HAS EMBRACED 

3551
01:54:28,494 --> 01:54:31,264
DONALD TRUMP, THE LIKELY WINNER 

3552
01:54:31,264 --> 01:54:32,498
OF THIS ELECTION TONIGHT. 

3553
01:54:32,498 --> 01:54:34,267
COMPARED TO KIRSTEN CINEMA, WHO 

3554
01:54:34,267 --> 01:54:35,068
IS TELLING PEOPLE, I DON'T 

3555
01:54:35,068 --> 01:54:37,103
THINK DONALD TRUMP IS A FACTOR 

3556
01:54:37,103 --> 01:54:38,237
IN THIS CASE. 

3557
01:54:38,237 --> 01:54:39,739
I DON'T THINK THIS RACE IS 

3558
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:41,274
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, IT'S ABOUT 

3559
01:54:41,274 --> 01:54:43,609
WHAT PEOPLE IN ARIZONA NEED. 

3560
01:54:43,609 --> 01:54:45,478
IT'S ABOUT MOVING THE COUNTRY 

3561
01:54:45,478 --> 01:54:46,045
FORWARD. 

3562
01:54:46,045 --> 01:54:46,646
THAT KIND OF RHETORIC. 

3563
01:54:46,646 --> 01:54:48,081
AND I THINK AS MUCH AS KIRSTEN 

3564
01:54:48,081 --> 01:54:51,551
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT, IT WILL 

3565
01:54:51,551 --> 01:54:52,485
BE LARGELY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. 

3566
01:54:52,485 --> 01:54:54,487
HE IS GOING TO BE HANGING OVER 

3567
01:54:54,487 --> 01:54:58,591
ALL OF THESE CONGRESSIONAL AND 

3568
01:54:58,591 --> 01:54:59,658
SENATE AND EVEN GUBERNATORIAL 

3569
01:54:59,658 --> 01:55:01,627
RACES HERE THIS YEAR. 

3570
01:55:01,627 --> 01:55:03,062
AND THIS, IF ANYTHING, 

3571
01:55:03,062 --> 01:55:05,164
DEMOCRATS DO HAVE AN 

3572
01:55:05,164 --> 01:55:07,333
OPPORTUNITY, IF THEY CAN 

3573
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:08,234
CAPITALIZE ON PEOPLE'S CONCERNS 

3574
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:11,137
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND MAKE THE 

3575
01:55:11,137 --> 01:55:12,305
NARRATIVE ABOUT BEING A 

3576
01:55:12,305 --> 01:55:12,805
WATCHDOG OVER THE TRUMP 

3577
01:55:12,805 --> 01:55:15,241
ADMINISTRATION. 

3578
01:55:15,241 --> 01:55:20,079
>> WELL, UNTIL -- I'M TOLD NOW, 

3579
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:21,714
WE HAVE MARTHA McSALLY GOING 

3580
01:55:21,714 --> 01:55:23,015
AFTER KIRSTEN CINEMA NOW. 

3581
01:55:23,015 --> 01:55:24,417
LET'S PLAY THAT AD AD FOR 

3582
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:24,684
VIEWERS. 

3583
01:55:24,684 --> 01:55:25,418
>> EVERYONE REMEMBERS WHERE 

3584
01:55:25,418 --> 01:55:26,185
THEY WERE ON 9/11. 

3585
01:55:26,185 --> 01:55:28,688
I WAS DEPLOYED TO THE MIDDLE 

3586
01:55:28,688 --> 01:55:28,888
EAST. 

3587
01:55:28,888 --> 01:55:30,990
LED AIR STRIKES AGAINST THE 

3588
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:33,192
TALIBAN AND WAS FIRST WOMAN TO 

3589
01:55:33,192 --> 01:55:33,926
FLY A JET IN COMBAT. 

3590
01:55:33,926 --> 01:55:35,795
I KNOW THE PRICE OF FREEDOM. 

3591
01:55:35,795 --> 01:55:38,498
WHILE WE WERE IN HARM'S WAY, IN 

3592
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:39,465
UNIFORM, KIRSTEN CINEMA WAS 

3593
01:55:39,465 --> 01:55:42,335
PROTESTING US IN A PINK TUTU, 

3594
01:55:42,335 --> 01:55:43,870
AND DENIGRATING OUR SERVICE. 

3595
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:46,306
THE WORLD IS A DANGEROUS PLACE. 

3596
01:55:46,306 --> 01:55:51,577
WE NEED STRONG LEADERS WHO 

3597
01:55:51,577 --> 01:55:52,077
UNDERSTAND THE THREAT. 

3598
01:55:52,077 --> 01:55:54,614
KIRSTEN CINEMA FAILED THE TEST. 

3599
01:55:54,614 --> 01:55:58,017
I'M MARTHA McSALLY AND I 

3600
01:55:58,017 --> 01:55:59,185
APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. 

3601
01:55:59,185 --> 01:56:02,155
>> THAT PARTICULAR APPROACH, 

3602
01:56:02,155 --> 01:56:03,823
GOING AFTER A CANDIDATE'S ANTI-

3603
01:56:03,823 --> 01:56:04,190
WAR PROTEST. 

3604
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:07,226
>> CERTAINLY NAIMAGE OF A PINK 

3605
01:56:07,226 --> 01:56:08,394
TUTU, CONTRASTED WITH MARTHA 

3606
01:56:08,394 --> 01:56:10,496
McSALLY, IN THE COCKPIT OF A 

3607
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:13,299
FIGHTER PLANE, IS NOT A GOOD 

3608
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:14,033
IMAGE FOR KIRSTEN CINEMA. 

3609
01:56:14,033 --> 01:56:18,037
THAT WAS TAKEN A LONG TIME AGO. 

3610
01:56:18,037 --> 01:56:20,006
KIRSTEN CINEMA WAS MUCH MORE 

3611
01:56:20,006 --> 01:56:21,140
LEFTY, BEFORE SHE GOT ELECTED 

3612
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:24,444
TO THE STATE LADIES AND 

3613
01:56:24,444 --> 01:56:25,544
GENTLEMENALATE -- LEGISLATURE, 

3614
01:56:25,544 --> 01:56:26,879
AND EVENTUALLY TO CONGRESS, 

3615
01:56:26,879 --> 01:56:28,848
WHERE SHE HAS CALIBRATED 

3616
01:56:28,848 --> 01:56:31,684
HERSELF INTO A MUCH MORE 

3617
01:56:31,684 --> 01:56:32,117
CALIBRATED PROFILE. 

3618
01:56:32,117 --> 01:56:37,423
NOW, SHE'S BEEN RUNNING ADS, 

3619
01:56:37,423 --> 01:56:40,326
TRYING TO INOCALATE -- 

3620
01:56:40,326 --> 01:56:41,094
INOCALATE HERSELF AGAINST THIS 

3621
01:56:41,094 --> 01:56:42,495
-- SHE WAS ANTICIPATING THIS 

3622
01:56:42,495 --> 01:56:49,335
LINE OF ATTACK, RIGHT FROM THE 

3623
01:56:49,335 --> 01:56:54,640
GET-GO I THINK THESE ARE VERY 

3624
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:55,207
SMART, SAVVY WOMEN. 

3625
01:56:55,207 --> 01:56:56,476
THIS IS DEGREE TO BE A -- THIS 

3626
01:56:56,476 --> 01:56:58,610
IS GOING TO BE A BARN BURNER. 

3627
01:56:58,610 --> 01:57:00,312
>> OF COURSE, THIS HAPPENS IN 

3628
01:57:00,312 --> 01:57:04,317
THE SHADOW OF SENATOR JOHN 

3629
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:05,251
McCAIN'S PASSING. 

3630
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:10,089
WHAT HAVE WE SEEN FROM THE 

3631
01:57:10,089 --> 01:57:11,423
CANDIDATES IN THE RACES? 

3632
01:57:11,423 --> 01:57:12,792
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING 

3633
01:57:12,792 --> 01:57:13,059
ELEMENT. 

3634
01:57:13,059 --> 01:57:13,960
BECAUSE JOHN McCAIN, OF COURSE, 

3635
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:15,694
WAS FEUDING WITH DONALD TRUMP. 

3636
01:57:15,694 --> 01:57:19,098
SO YOU HAVEN'T SEEN VERY MUCH 

3637
01:57:19,098 --> 01:57:22,535
OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES 

3638
01:57:22,535 --> 01:57:23,068
SEEKING HIS ENDORSEMENT. 

3639
01:57:23,068 --> 01:57:23,836
ILLNESS, OBVIOUSLY PLAYS A ROLE 

3640
01:57:23,836 --> 01:57:24,103
IN THAT. 

3641
01:57:24,103 --> 01:57:26,772
BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. 

3642
01:57:26,772 --> 01:57:29,809
KELLI WARD IS RUNNING AGAINST 

3643
01:57:29,809 --> 01:57:30,176
MARTHA McSALLY. 

3644
01:57:30,176 --> 01:57:30,843
ACCUSING THE McCAIN FAMILY OF 

3645
01:57:30,843 --> 01:57:33,212
ANNOUNCING THAT THEY WERE GOING 

3646
01:57:33,212 --> 01:57:34,680
TO STOP MEDICAL TREATMENT TO 

3647
01:57:34,680 --> 01:57:36,182
SIDELINE THE CAMPAIGN AND TO 

3648
01:57:36,182 --> 01:57:38,051
TRY TO MAKE HER LOOK BAD, WHICH 

3649
01:57:38,051 --> 01:57:45,992
IS KIND OF A CRAZY THING TO 

3650
01:57:45,992 --> 01:57:46,425
SAY. 

3651
01:57:46,425 --> 01:57:48,427
BUT MARTHA McSALLY IS SNOT 

3652
01:57:48,427 --> 01:57:50,663
TRYING TO SAY MUCH ABOUT JOHN 

3653
01:57:50,663 --> 01:57:53,032
McCAIN, WHO WAS ONE OF HER BIG 

3654
01:57:53,032 --> 01:57:54,366
SUPPORTERS DURING HER CAMPAIGN 

3655
01:57:54,366 --> 01:57:54,567
RUN. 

3656
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:55,968
IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING, THE 

3657
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:57,102
MUTED ASPECT OF McCAIN SUPPORT. 

3658
01:57:57,102 --> 01:57:58,438
ON THE OTHER HAND, A LOT OF 

3659
01:57:58,438 --> 01:57:59,972
PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED IN 

3660
01:57:59,972 --> 01:58:00,373
ARIZONA. 

3661
01:58:00,373 --> 01:58:01,106
WE HAVE EARLY VOTING. 

3662
01:58:01,106 --> 01:58:03,442
AND AS A RESULT, YOU KNOW, 70% 

3663
01:58:03,442 --> 01:58:04,676
OF THE PEOPLE CAST A BALLOT 

3664
01:58:04,676 --> 01:58:06,379
BEFORE ELECTION DAY. 

3665
01:58:06,379 --> 01:58:07,780
I SUSPECT HIS PASSING IS NOT 

3666
01:58:07,780 --> 01:58:09,749
GOING TO OF TOO MUCH OF AN 

3667
01:58:09,749 --> 01:58:10,949
EFFECT ON WHAT IS GOING ON 

3668
01:58:10,949 --> 01:58:14,420
TODAY IN ELECTIONS. 

3669
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:16,089
>> ALL RIGHT, JIM NITZEL. 

3670
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:17,123
THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 

3671
01:58:17,123 --> 01:58:17,390
INSIGHT. 

3672
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:18,090
>> OH, IT'S A PLEASURE. 

3673
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:18,824
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 

3674
01:58:18,824 --> 01:58:22,195
>> AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BE 

3675
01:58:22,195 --> 01:58:23,962
QUICK -- TAKE A QUICK BREAK. 

3676

MUCH MORE PRIMARY AHEAD, AS WE 

3677
01:58:25,264 --> 01:58:28,501
HOPE TO START GETTING MORE 

3678
01:58:28,501 --> 01:58:28,968
RESULTS FROM ARIZONA.

01:58:28,968 --> 01:58:29,368

POLLS ARE CLOSED IN BOTH 

3686

3687
02:01:14,967 --> 02:01:17,203
AND SOME RACES HAVE ALREADY 

3688
02:01:17,203 --> 02:01:17,536
BEEN CALLED. 

3689
02:01:17,536 --> 02:01:19,538
THIS IS THE LAST BIG PRIMARY 

3690
02:01:19,538 --> 02:01:21,240
DAY BEFORE THE CRITICAL 

3691
02:01:21,240 --> 02:01:23,576
NOVEMBER ELECTIONS.

TONIGHT'S RESULTS ARE 

3693
02:01:24,377 --> 02:01:25,211
DETERMINING MIDTERM MATCHUPS 

3694
02:01:25,211 --> 02:01:27,580
FOR GOVERNOR, SENATE, AND THE 

3695
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:28,047
HOUSE. 

3696
02:01:28,047 --> 02:01:30,015
IN ARIZONA, THE STATE'S 

3697
02:01:30,015 --> 02:01:30,582
REPUBLICAN SENATE RACE HAS 

3698
02:01:30,582 --> 02:01:32,685
RECEIVED ENORMOUS ATTENTION. 

3699
02:01:32,685 --> 02:01:34,086
IT FEATURES THREE CANDIDATES  

3700
02:01:34,086 --> 02:01:36,956
WHO HAVE VIED FOR THE 

3701
02:01:36,956 --> 02:01:37,590
PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT, BUT 

3702
02:01:37,590 --> 02:01:39,057
HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. 

3703
02:01:39,057 --> 02:01:41,160
THEY ARE RUNNING TO REPLACE GOP 

3704
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:42,728
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE, WHO IS 

3705
02:01:42,728 --> 02:01:42,995
RETIRING. 

3706
02:01:42,995 --> 02:01:44,430
THE RACES IN ARIZONA ARE 

3707
02:01:44,430 --> 02:01:47,299
HAPPENING IN THE SHADOW OF 

3708
02:01:47,299 --> 02:01:47,966
SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S PASSING. 

3709
02:01:47,966 --> 02:01:48,433
THE LONG-TIME ARIZONA 

3710
02:01:48,433 --> 02:01:50,903
REPUBLICAN SEAT IS NOT UP FOR 

3711
02:01:50,903 --> 02:01:52,938
GRABS TONIGHT, BUT HIS DEATH 

3712
02:01:52,938 --> 02:01:54,940
HAS PUT A SPOTLIGHT ON THE 

3713
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:55,874
FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

3714
02:01:55,874 --> 02:01:57,175
>>> AND IN FLORIDA, WE ARE 

3715
02:01:57,175 --> 02:01:59,111
SEEING THE FIRST UPSET OF THE 

3716
02:01:59,111 --> 02:02:00,913
NIGHT, WHERE ANDREW GILLUM HAS 

3717
02:02:00,913 --> 02:02:03,349
WON THE DEMOCRATIC RACE FOR 

3718
02:02:03,349 --> 02:02:03,616
GOVERNOR. 

3719
02:02:03,616 --> 02:02:05,551
HE WAS BACKED BY SENATOR BERNIE

02:02:05,551 --> 02:02:07,053
SAND SANDERS AND NOW AIMS TO BE 

3721

02:02:11,122 --> 02:02:14,593
GILLUM WILL NOW FACE 

3724
02:02:14,593 --> 02:02:16,462
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS, WHO 

3725
02:02:16,462 --> 02:02:17,296
DEFEATED ANDREW PUTNAM IN THE 

3726
02:02:17,296 --> 02:02:21,734
PRIMARY RACE. 

3727
02:02:21,734 --> 02:02:23,035
MR. TRUMP BACKED CONGRESSMAN 

3728
02:02:23,035 --> 02:02:25,237

>>> MEANWHILE, IN THE SENATE 

3733
02:02:30,443 --> 02:02:32,712
RACE, REPUBLICAN RICK SCOTT HAS 

3734
02:02:32,712 --> 02:02:35,681

3735
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:37,149
HE'LL FACE OFF AGAINST

02:02:37,149 --> 02:02:38,150
INCUMBENT BILL NELSON.

FLORIDA, ANT JUAN. 

3747

THIS IS SOMETHING THAT FOLKS 

3748
02:03:11,383 --> 02:03:12,284
WERE NOT EXPECTING NECESSARILY 

3749
02:03:12,284 --> 02:03:13,185
TO HAPPEN. 

3750
02:03:13,185 --> 02:03:17,189
THE ATTENTION, WE HEARD IT FROM 

3751
02:03:17,189 --> 02:03:19,658
LARRY SAB ATO -- SABATO EARLY 

3752
02:03:19,658 --> 02:03:20,058
NER THE EVENING. 

3753
02:03:20,058 --> 02:03:22,528
THAT -- EARLIER IN THE EVENING. 

3754
02:03:22,528 --> 02:03:25,030
THAT THE DEMOCRATS HE TALKED 

3755
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:25,764
TO, THOUGHT ANOTHER CANDIDATE, 

3756
02:03:25,764 --> 02:03:27,066
GWEN GRAHAM WAS GOING TO BE THE 

3757
02:03:27,066 --> 02:03:29,268
ONE TO RUN IN THE GENERAL. 

3758
02:03:29,268 --> 02:03:30,336
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE? 

3759
02:03:30,336 --> 02:03:32,171
>> WELL, IT'S A HISTORIC NIGHT. 

3760
02:03:32,171 --> 02:03:33,706
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 

3761
02:03:33,706 --> 02:03:36,174
THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF 

3762
02:03:36,174 --> 02:03:37,242
FLORIDA, THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE 

3763
02:03:37,242 --> 02:03:38,377
IS AFRICAN AMERICAN. 

3764
02:03:38,377 --> 02:03:39,612
AND HE IS POSITIONED, IF ALL 

3765
02:03:39,612 --> 02:03:40,913
GOES WELL, TO BE THE FIRST 

3766
02:03:40,913 --> 02:03:41,847
AFRICAN AMERICAN GOVERNOR OF 

3767
02:03:41,847 --> 02:03:43,315
THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

3768
02:03:43,315 --> 02:03:43,982
SO IT'S A HISTORIC NIGHT. 

3769
02:03:43,982 --> 02:03:46,051
THE SECOND THING I WILL TELL 

3770
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:48,153
YOU IS THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO DID 

3771
02:03:48,153 --> 02:03:49,688
NOT THINK TONIGHT WAS POSSIBLE 

3772
02:03:49,688 --> 02:03:51,624
WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT 

3773
02:03:51,624 --> 02:03:52,057
PAYING ATTENTION. 

3774
02:03:52,057 --> 02:03:54,527
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THE 

3775
02:03:54,527 --> 02:03:56,395
CAMPAIGNS MATCHED UP, FROM A 

3776
02:03:56,395 --> 02:03:57,463
PURE TACTICAL STANDPOINT, AND 

3777
02:03:57,463 --> 02:03:59,598
WHAT WAS DONE, I MENTIONED 

3778
02:03:59,598 --> 02:04:00,666
EARLIER, GILLUM'S TEAM DID A 

3779
02:04:00,666 --> 02:04:03,068
GREAT JOB OF HAVING A CAMPAIGN 

3780
02:04:03,068 --> 02:04:05,738
THAT WAS NOT ONLY HIGH TECH, 

3781
02:04:05,738 --> 02:04:06,405
LIKE TRADITIONAL CAMPAIGNS ARE, 

3782
02:04:06,405 --> 02:04:07,673
IN 2018. 

3783
02:04:07,673 --> 02:04:09,008
BUT IT WAS A COMBINATION OF 

3784
02:04:09,008 --> 02:04:10,242
HIGH TECH AND HIGH TOUCH. 

3785
02:04:10,242 --> 02:04:11,877
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE BREAD AND 

3786
02:04:11,877 --> 02:04:14,380
BUTTER ISSUES, THE ISSUES WE 

3787
02:04:14,380 --> 02:04:16,649
HEAR AT BARBER SHOPS AND BEAUTY 

3788
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:17,349
SALONS AND NAIL SHOPS. 

3789
02:04:17,349 --> 02:04:18,517
THEY TALKED ABOUT QUALITY OF 

3790
02:04:18,517 --> 02:04:18,850
LIFE THINGS. 

3791
02:04:18,850 --> 02:04:21,020
AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE FUTURE 

3792
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,421
THAT I THINK WOULD IMPACT 

3793
02:04:22,421 --> 02:04:23,021
FUTURE FLORIDA GENERATIONS. 

3794
02:04:23,021 --> 02:04:25,190
AND I THINK THAT MADE ALL OF 

3795
02:04:25,190 --> 02:04:25,657
THE DIFFERENCE. 

3796
02:04:25,657 --> 02:04:28,227
NOW, POLITICS, LIKE LIFE, IS A 

3797
02:04:28,227 --> 02:04:30,462
GAME OF MATCHUPS. 

3798
02:04:30,462 --> 02:04:32,498
AND I'M A FUNDAMENTAL BELIEVER 

3799
02:04:32,498 --> 02:04:37,670
THAT POLITICS, LIKE LIFE, IS 

3800
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:40,806
ABOUT ADDITION AND MULTIPLISKS, 

3801
02:04:40,806 --> 02:04:42,441
NOT -- MULTIPLICATION, NOT 

3802
02:04:42,441 --> 02:04:43,742
SUBTRACTION OR DIVISION. 

3803
02:04:43,742 --> 02:04:45,677
AND THAT IS WHAT POSITIONS 

3804
02:04:45,677 --> 02:04:48,146
ANDREW GILLUM TO WIN IN 

3805
02:04:48,146 --> 02:04:48,413
NOVEMBER. 

3806
02:04:48,413 --> 02:04:51,584
AND BRING ALONG PEOPLE WITH 

3807
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:51,850
HIM. 

3808
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:54,286
LIKE CONVINCE FLORIDA VOTE BILL 

3809
02:04:54,286 --> 02:04:56,055
NELSON SHOULD BE REELECTED AS 

3810
02:04:56,055 --> 02:04:57,056
SENATOR. 

3811
02:04:57,056 --> 02:04:59,058
>> LESLIE, THOUGH, THE CONTRAST 

3812
02:04:59,058 --> 02:05:01,160
BETWEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES, 

3813
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:02,294
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS, 

3814
02:05:02,294 --> 02:05:03,261
ENDORSED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

3815
02:05:03,261 --> 02:05:04,863
WHO ACTUALLY, BEFORE THE 

3816
02:05:04,863 --> 02:05:06,332
PRESIDENT'S TWEET, BACK IN 

3817
02:05:06,332 --> 02:05:08,567
JUNE, WAS BEHIND IN THE POLLS. 

3818
02:05:08,567 --> 02:05:09,301
THEN AFTER THE PRESIDENT 

3819
02:05:09,301 --> 02:05:11,203
TWEETED ABOUT HIM, GOT A HUGE 

3820
02:05:11,203 --> 02:05:11,537
BUMP. 

3821
02:05:11,537 --> 02:05:12,738
AND THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME 

3822
02:05:12,738 --> 02:05:15,074
TO TAMPA FOR A CAMPAIGN RALLY 

3823
02:05:15,074 --> 02:05:15,307
THERE. 

3824
02:05:15,307 --> 02:05:19,178
AND NOW HE'S EMERGED, THE 

3825
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:19,611
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. 

3826
02:05:19,611 --> 02:05:21,513
HOW STARK IS THAT CONTRAS? 

3827
02:05:21,513 --> 02:05:22,915
AND YOU HEARD WHAT ANT JUAN 

3828
02:05:22,915 --> 02:05:23,882
JUST SPELLED OUT THERE, IN 

3829
02:05:23,882 --> 02:05:27,319
TERMS OF THE APPEAL THERE. 

3830
02:05:27,319 --> 02:05:28,019
OF ANDREW GILLUM. 

3831
02:05:28,019 --> 02:05:29,688
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY HERE FOR 

3832
02:05:29,688 --> 02:05:30,021
REPUBLICANS? 

3833
02:05:30,021 --> 02:05:30,622
>> DEFINITELY, THE PARTY AND 

3834
02:05:30,622 --> 02:05:34,260
THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO SAY 

3835
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:36,095
THE PRESIDENT'S ENDORSEMENT 

3836
02:05:36,095 --> 02:05:36,428
MATTERS. 

3837
02:05:36,428 --> 02:05:38,864
IT GENERATED A TREMENDOUS 

3838
02:05:38,864 --> 02:05:39,097
AMOUNT. 

3839
02:05:39,097 --> 02:05:39,464
MEDIA DOLLARS. 

3840
02:05:39,464 --> 02:05:40,165
AND GALVANIZED THE BASE TO COME 

3841
02:05:40,165 --> 02:05:41,266
OUT AND SUPPORT DURING THE 

3842
02:05:41,266 --> 02:05:42,334
PRIMARY. 

3843
02:05:42,334 --> 02:05:44,102
BUT ONE THING TO CONSIDER. 

3844
02:05:44,102 --> 02:05:45,471
IT WAS A VERY REPUBLICAN 

3845
02:05:45,471 --> 02:05:46,604
PRIMARY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. 

3846
02:05:46,604 --> 02:05:48,040
AND IT'S BEEN RAISED SEVERAL 

3847
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,308
TIMES THAT ALL OF THOSE 

3848
02:05:49,308 --> 02:05:50,809
NEGATIVE ADS AND ALL OF THOSE 

3849
02:05:50,809 --> 02:05:53,912
DOLLARS AND ALL OF THOSE LIVE 

3850
02:05:53,912 --> 02:05:55,347
BALLS HAVEN'T BEEN TARGETED AT 

3851
02:05:55,347 --> 02:05:56,548
THESE TWO, TO THE LEVEL THAT 

3852
02:05:56,548 --> 02:05:58,550
WE'LL SEE COMING IN NOVEMBER. 

3853
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:59,084
EVERYTHING FROM FBI 

3854
02:05:59,084 --> 02:05:59,785
INVESTIGATIONS TO YOU KNOW, 

3855
02:05:59,785 --> 02:06:02,655
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO IN 

3856
02:06:02,655 --> 02:06:05,190
TERMS OF IMMIGRATION AND HOW 

3857
02:06:05,190 --> 02:06:07,292
LONG STEP ARE YOU GOING TO BE 

3858
02:06:07,292 --> 02:06:07,759
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 

3859
02:06:07,759 --> 02:06:08,827
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT 

3860
02:06:08,827 --> 02:06:10,362
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE 

3861
02:06:10,362 --> 02:06:12,665
TO GRAPPLE WITH AND DECIDE WHO 

3862
02:06:12,665 --> 02:06:13,999
IS THE FAIREST REPRESENTATION 

3863
02:06:13,999 --> 02:06:14,399
OF THEIR STATE. 

3864
02:06:14,399 --> 02:06:16,602
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE 

3865
02:06:16,602 --> 02:06:18,336
AN EASY CALL TO MAKE TODAY. 

3866
02:06:18,336 --> 02:06:20,906
>> WHAT ABOUT THE 

3867
02:06:20,906 --> 02:06:21,273
ELECTORRALITY. 

3868
02:06:21,273 --> 02:06:21,807
AND THE -- ELECTORATE. 

3869
02:06:21,807 --> 02:06:25,177
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT'S A 

3870
02:06:25,177 --> 02:06:26,545
TRANSIENT POPULATION AND 

3871
02:06:26,545 --> 02:06:27,212
YOUNGER POPULATION. 

3872
02:06:27,212 --> 02:06:28,814
AND THOSE YOUNGER VOTERS TEND 

3873
02:06:28,814 --> 02:06:29,481
TO BE INDEPENDENT. 

3874
02:06:29,481 --> 02:06:31,650
>> THERE'S YOUNGER VOTERS IN 

3875
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:31,984
FLORIDA. 

3876
02:06:31,984 --> 02:06:33,518
BUT A LOT OF OLDER VOTERS, TOO. 

3877
02:06:33,518 --> 02:06:36,355
I THINK WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE 

3878
02:06:36,355 --> 02:06:36,855
TESTED IN FLORIDA AND 

3879
02:06:36,855 --> 02:06:39,425
EVERYWHERE ELSE, IS THE 

3880
02:06:39,425 --> 02:06:41,527
TRADITIONAL MIDTERM TURNOUT 

3881
02:06:41,527 --> 02:06:41,760
MODEL. 

3882
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:43,328
UPON MIGHT GET TURNED ON ITS 

3883
02:06:43,328 --> 02:06:43,995
HEAD, IF DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO 

3884
02:06:43,995 --> 02:06:45,964
SHOW UP IN THE NUMBERS THAT 

3885
02:06:45,964 --> 02:06:48,333
THEY'VE SHOWN UP IN THE 

3886
02:06:48,333 --> 02:06:48,633
PRIMARIES. 

3887
02:06:48,633 --> 02:06:50,202
AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S LOOKING 

3888
02:06:50,202 --> 02:06:50,402
LIKE. 

3889
02:06:50,402 --> 02:06:51,069
BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEING MORE. 

3890
02:06:51,069 --> 02:06:51,936
AND I'VE TALKED TO VOTERS 

3891
02:06:51,936 --> 02:06:54,406
ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 

3892
02:06:54,406 --> 02:06:55,774
DEMOCRATIC VOTERS, PEOPLE WHO 

3893
02:06:55,774 --> 02:06:57,108
ARE VOTE FOR EXAMPLE DEMOCRATS 

3894
02:06:57,108 --> 02:06:58,043
WHO SAY, YOU KNOW, I DON'T 

3895
02:06:58,043 --> 02:07:01,580
NORMALLY SHOW UP IN A 

3896
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:02,013
CONGRESSIONAL YEAR. 

3897
02:07:02,013 --> 02:07:03,348
I ONLY FOCUS ON THE PRESIDENCY. 

3898
02:07:03,348 --> 02:07:05,250
AND AGAIN, THEY'RE TELLING US 

3899
02:07:05,250 --> 02:07:06,318
THIS. 

3900
02:07:06,318 --> 02:07:07,553
WE'RE NOT PROMPTING THEM. 

3901
02:07:07,553 --> 02:07:10,723
AND THEY ADMIT, I'VE GOT TO DO 

3902
02:07:10,723 --> 02:07:10,923
MORE. 

3903
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:12,624
SO I'M SHOWING UP THIS YEAR. 

3904
02:07:12,624 --> 02:07:13,658
KNOCKING ON DOORS, DONATING 

3905
02:07:13,658 --> 02:07:13,959
MONEY. 

3906
02:07:13,959 --> 02:07:15,160
SOME ARE EVEN RUNNING FOR 

3907
02:07:15,160 --> 02:07:16,094
OFFICE, UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT. 

3908
02:07:16,094 --> 02:07:17,963
AND I THINK IF THAT CONTINUES, 

3909
02:07:17,963 --> 02:07:19,865
AND IF WE SEE THAT INTENSITY 

3910
02:07:19,865 --> 02:07:21,333
PREVAIL, THROUGH NOVEMBER. 

3911
02:07:21,333 --> 02:07:23,068
IT'S GOING TO TURN WHAT WE'VE 

3912
02:07:23,068 --> 02:07:24,303
THOUGHT ABOUT MIDTERM ELECTIONS 

3913
02:07:24,303 --> 02:07:24,770
ON ITS HEAD. 

3914
02:07:24,770 --> 02:07:27,406
AND THAT MAY BE JUST ENOUGH FOR 

3915
02:07:27,406 --> 02:07:29,875
DEMOCRATS TO WIN NARROWLY IN 

3916
02:07:29,875 --> 02:07:30,242
SOME RACES. 

3917
02:07:30,242 --> 02:07:33,712
AND BY BIG MARGINS IN OTHERS. 

3918
02:07:33,712 --> 02:07:34,880
>> LET'S BRING IN ANTHONY 

3919
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:36,882
SALVANTO, WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING 

3920
02:07:36,882 --> 02:07:37,649
AT THE MAP THERE. 

3921
02:07:37,649 --> 02:07:38,750
ANTHONY, TELL US ABOUT FLORIDA. 

3922
02:07:38,750 --> 02:07:42,287
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE? 

3923
02:07:42,287 --> 02:07:45,124
>> WELL, AS IF ON CUE, ED TEED 

3924
02:07:45,124 --> 02:07:46,925
THIS UP. 

3925
02:07:46,925 --> 02:07:47,559
HERE'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 

3926
02:07:47,559 --> 02:07:48,961
NOT ALWAYS BY NEWS THERE. 

3927
02:07:48,961 --> 02:07:50,462
BUT TURNOUT IS ONE OF THE 

3928
02:07:50,462 --> 02:07:51,730
THINGS EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE 

3929
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:52,063
LOOKING FOR. 

3930
02:07:52,063 --> 02:07:53,665
AND WE'RE GOING TO READ THE TEA 

3931
02:07:53,665 --> 02:07:56,268
LEAVES OF PRIMARIES TO SEE IF 

3932
02:07:56,268 --> 02:07:57,336
THAT PORTENDS SOMETHING GOING 

3933
02:07:57,336 --> 02:07:57,870
FORWARD. 

3934
02:07:57,870 --> 02:07:59,972
THE TURNOUT HERE ON THE 

3935
02:07:59,972 --> 02:08:01,874
DEMOCRATIC SIDE, IN THE 

3936
02:08:01,874 --> 02:08:02,374
GOVERNOR'S PRIMARY, IS 

3937
02:08:02,374 --> 02:08:03,275
APPROACHING, AS THESE VOTE 

3938
02:08:03,275 --> 02:08:05,844
COMES IN, WHAT WE SAW IN THE 

3939
02:08:05,844 --> 02:08:08,480
2016 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. 

3940
02:08:08,480 --> 02:08:11,350
IT'S UP OVER 80% NOW. 

3941
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:14,052
IT'S GOING TO BE AROUND 86%, 

3942
02:08:14,052 --> 02:08:15,854
87%, I THINK, WHEN ALL IS SAID 

3943
02:08:15,854 --> 02:08:16,121
AND DONE. 

3944
02:08:16,121 --> 02:08:17,156
MAYBE MORE. 

3945
02:08:17,156 --> 02:08:19,057
AND YOU KNOW, THAT WAS HELPED. 

3946
02:08:19,057 --> 02:08:21,994
WE BROKE THIS DOWN A LITTLE BIT 

3947
02:08:21,994 --> 02:08:22,261
EARLIER. 

3948
02:08:22,261 --> 02:08:24,429
BY THE TURNOUT IN THE URBAN 

3949
02:08:24,429 --> 02:08:25,430
AREAS IN THE CITIES. 

3950
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:29,168
YOU GO AROUND ORANGE COUNTY. 

3951
02:08:29,168 --> 02:08:29,668
THAT'S AROUND ORLANDO. 

3952
02:08:29,668 --> 02:08:30,301
AROUND MIAMI-DADE, AROUND 

3953
02:08:30,301 --> 02:08:31,970
BROWARD, ET CETERA. 

3954
02:08:31,970 --> 02:08:33,105
PLACES WHERE ANDREW GILLUM DID 

3955
02:08:33,105 --> 02:08:33,305
WELL. 

3956
02:08:33,305 --> 02:08:35,574
BUT IF YOU -- I THINK THE KEY 

3957
02:08:35,574 --> 02:08:37,109
QUESTION GOING FORWARD IS, 

3958
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:39,011
THESE ARE FOLKS, LIKE ED 

3959
02:08:39,011 --> 02:08:40,412
DESCRIBED, PERHAPS, WHO VOTE IN 

3960
02:08:40,412 --> 02:08:41,947
PRESIDENTIAL YEARS, BUT DON'T 

3961
02:08:41,947 --> 02:08:43,582
ALWAYS SHOW UP IN MIDTERMS. 

3962
02:08:43,582 --> 02:08:46,351
IF THEY'RE NOW VOTING IN A 

3963
02:08:46,351 --> 02:08:47,419
PRIMARY, WELL, A POLLSTER IS 

3964
02:08:47,419 --> 02:08:48,887
GOING TO LOOK AT THAT AND GOING 

3965
02:08:48,887 --> 02:08:50,322
TO SAY, OKAY. 

3966
02:08:50,322 --> 02:08:51,923
THAT IS PROBABLY A LIKELY 

3967
02:08:51,923 --> 02:08:53,158
VOTER, COME NOVEMBER. 

3968
02:08:53,158 --> 02:08:55,194
THEN THE QUESTION IS GOING TO 

3969
02:08:55,194 --> 02:08:57,095
BE, IS THERE ANOTHER LEVEL OF 

3970
02:08:57,095 --> 02:08:58,597
VOTER, COME NOVEMBER, WHO 

3971
02:08:58,597 --> 02:08:59,565
HASN'T BEEN IN THESE PRIMARIES, 

3972
02:08:59,565 --> 02:09:00,966
WHO WILL COME OUT. 

3973
02:09:00,966 --> 02:09:02,501
AND THAT WOULD TAKE TURNOUT 

3974
02:09:02,501 --> 02:09:02,834
EVEN HIGHER. 

3975
02:09:02,834 --> 02:09:04,136
BUT I SHOULDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT 

3976
02:09:04,136 --> 02:09:05,370
THE DEMOCRATS HERE. 

3977
02:09:05,370 --> 02:09:08,373
WE'VE ALSO GOT TO LOOK AT THE 

3978
02:09:08,373 --> 02:09:09,575
REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE THEIR TURN 

3979
02:09:09,575 --> 02:09:11,577
TURNOUT HERE IS NO SLOUCH 

3980
02:09:11,577 --> 02:09:11,810
EITHER. 

3981
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:13,345
YOU KNOW, RICK SCOTT WON 

3982
02:09:13,345 --> 02:09:13,812
EASILY. 

3983
02:09:13,812 --> 02:09:17,182
BUT ONCE YOU GET UP OVER 1.5 

3984
02:09:17,182 --> 02:09:19,585
MILLION VOTES, NOW HERE YOU'RE 

3985
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:21,153
TALKING APPROACHING ALMOST 70% 

3986
02:09:21,153 --> 02:09:25,323
OF THE TURNOUT IN THE 2016 

3987
02:09:25,323 --> 02:09:25,957
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL 

3988
02:09:25,957 --> 02:09:26,224
PRIMARY. 

3989
02:09:26,224 --> 02:09:29,027
AND THAT, OF COURSE, WAS A 

3990
02:09:29,027 --> 02:09:29,627
REALLY CONTESTED, REALLY HOT 

3991
02:09:29,627 --> 02:09:30,362
RACE. 

3992
02:09:30,362 --> 02:09:32,097
SO REPUBLICANS ARE TURNING OUT 

3993
02:09:32,097 --> 02:09:32,397
HERE, TOO. 

3994
02:09:32,397 --> 02:09:33,298
AND I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. 

3995
02:09:33,298 --> 02:09:34,199
THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO 

3996
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:37,002
BE ONE OF THOSE BATTLES, AS WE 

3997
02:09:37,002 --> 02:09:37,502
HEAD TOWARDS NOVEMBER. 

3998
02:09:37,502 --> 02:09:39,571
NOT REALLY EVEN SO MUCH FOR THE 

3999
02:09:39,571 --> 02:09:39,804
MIDDLE. 

4000
02:09:39,804 --> 02:09:41,607
BUT BOTH PARTIES, SAYING, OKAY. 

4001
02:09:41,607 --> 02:09:42,641
YOU CAME OUT IN 2016. 

4002
02:09:42,641 --> 02:09:45,510
YOU'VE GOT TO COME OUT IN THIS 

4003
02:09:45,510 --> 02:09:45,877
CONGRESSIONAL. 

4004
02:09:45,877 --> 02:09:47,512
>> SO ANTHONY, WHAT YOU'RE 

4005
02:09:47,512 --> 02:09:51,016
SAYING THERE IS, WHILE TURNOUT 

4006
02:09:51,016 --> 02:09:52,618
IS IMPRESSIVE, PERCENTAGE, 

4007
02:09:52,618 --> 02:09:55,220
COMPARED TO 2016, WE SHOULD 

4008
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:56,355
RIMIND VOTERS -- REMIND VOTERS, 

4009
02:09:56,355 --> 02:09:57,355
THERE ARE STILL MORE 

4010
02:09:57,355 --> 02:09:58,523
REPUBLICANS VOTING IN THEIR 

4011
02:09:58,523 --> 02:10:00,826
PRAY MARRY TODAY, OR THAT HAVE 

4012
02:10:00,826 --> 02:10:02,861
VOTED THROUGHENTIAL VOTING AND 

4013
02:10:02,861 --> 02:10:05,731
TODAY -- THROUGH EARLY VOTING 

4014
02:10:05,731 --> 02:10:06,498
AND TODAY, THAN DEMOCRATS. 

4015
02:10:06,498 --> 02:10:08,333
IT'S THE PERCENTAGE THAT SHOWED 

4016
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:10,402
UP IT, IF THEY'RE A REGISTERED 

4017
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:12,471
DEMOCRAT, IS HIGHER, WHICH IS 

4018
02:10:12,471 --> 02:10:13,906
WHAT POTENTIALLY REMAKES THE 

4019
02:10:13,906 --> 02:10:15,440
MODELS OF TURNOUT ON BOTH 

4020
02:10:15,440 --> 02:10:15,807
SIDES. 

4021
02:10:15,807 --> 02:10:16,074
>> YEAH. 

4022
02:10:16,074 --> 02:10:18,210
I THINK -- YOU KNOW, YOU WANT 

4023
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:21,046
TO JUST BE CAREFUL WITH THE 

4024
02:10:21,046 --> 02:10:21,713
COMPARISONS HERE. 

4025
02:10:21,713 --> 02:10:24,049
I USE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL 

4026
02:10:24,049 --> 02:10:25,584
PRIMARY, AS ONE, KIND OF 

4027
02:10:25,584 --> 02:10:28,086
APPLES, WHAT I WOULD HOPE WOULD 

4028
02:10:28,086 --> 02:10:29,054
BE AN APPLES TO APPLES 

4029
02:10:29,054 --> 02:10:29,354
COMPARISON. 

4030
02:10:29,354 --> 02:10:31,456
WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT 

4031
02:10:31,456 --> 02:10:33,859
PAST MIDTERMS, THIS WILL EXCEED 

4032
02:10:33,859 --> 02:10:34,226
PAST MIDTERMS. 

4033
02:10:34,226 --> 02:10:37,496
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO FACTOR 

4034
02:10:37,496 --> 02:10:39,932
IN, WELL, OKAY, IN 2013, WAS 

4035
02:10:39,932 --> 02:10:41,333
THERE A COMPETITIVE RACE ON 

4036
02:10:41,333 --> 02:10:41,633
EACH SIDE? 

4037
02:10:41,633 --> 02:10:43,602
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT DON'T 

4038
02:10:43,602 --> 02:10:44,069
NECESSARILY MATCH UP. 

4039
02:10:44,069 --> 02:10:45,704
YOU COMPARE NOW TO THEN. 

4040
02:10:45,704 --> 02:10:46,972
AND IT'S A FALSE COMPARISON. 

4041
02:10:46,972 --> 02:10:49,107
BECAUSE MAYBE THE REPUBLICAN 

4042
02:10:49,107 --> 02:10:50,309
SIDE, THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, 

4043
02:10:50,309 --> 02:10:51,142
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS HOTLY 

4044
02:10:51,142 --> 02:10:53,111
CONTESTED ON THAT SIDE BACK 

4045
02:10:53,111 --> 02:10:53,311
THEN. 

4046
02:10:53,311 --> 02:10:54,880
SO THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY 

4047
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:55,680
HAVE EXPECTED A HIGH TURNOUT. 

4048
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:58,784
SO YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE THOSE 

4049
02:10:58,784 --> 02:10:59,718
KIND OF APPLES TO ORANGES 

4050
02:10:59,718 --> 02:11:00,051
COMPARISONS. 

4051
02:11:00,051 --> 02:11:03,855
THAT'S PERHAPS THE ONE THAT I 

4052
02:11:03,855 --> 02:11:05,256
MIGHT USE AS BENCHMARK. 

4053
02:11:05,256 --> 02:11:05,857
BUT EVEN THEN. 

4054
02:11:05,857 --> 02:11:07,859
THESE ARE THINGS WE'RE SETTING

4055
02:11:07,859 --> 02:11:08,659
UP AS WAYS TO COMPARE. 

4056
02:11:08,659 --> 02:11:10,729
AGAIN, I THINK THAT WHEN WE GET 

4057
02:11:10,729 --> 02:11:11,062
TO NOVEMBER. 

4058
02:11:11,062 --> 02:11:13,031
I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE A 

4059
02:11:13,031 --> 02:11:15,968
LOT OF THESE FOLKS WHO DON'T 

4060
02:11:15,968 --> 02:11:16,868
TYPICALLY VOTE IN MIDTERMS. 

4061
02:11:16,868 --> 02:11:18,437
REMEMBER, IN A MIDTERM 

4062
02:11:18,437 --> 02:11:21,173
ELECTION, YOU MIGHT GET 40% 

4063
02:11:21,173 --> 02:11:21,440
TURNOUT. 

4064
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:23,642
YOU KNOW, THAT'S LESS THAN HALF 

4065
02:11:23,642 --> 02:11:24,443
OF PEOPLE. 

4066
02:11:24,443 --> 02:11:26,845
IF THAT STARTS TO APPROACH 50%, 

4067
02:11:26,845 --> 02:11:30,115
WHICH WOULD BE -- WHICH WOULD 

4068
02:11:30,115 --> 02:11:30,649
BE REMARKABLE. 

4069
02:11:30,649 --> 02:11:33,585
BUT IF IT DOES, THEN WE HAVE A 

4070
02:11:33,585 --> 02:11:36,221
VERY DIFFERENT ELECTORATE, ED. 

4071
02:11:36,221 --> 02:11:37,355
>> ALL RIGHT. 

4072
02:11:37,355 --> 02:11:38,390
IMPORTANT CONTEX. 

4073
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:39,057
THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANTHONY. 

4074
02:11:39,057 --> 02:11:41,460
>>> LET'S TALK TO ARIZONA. 

4075
02:11:41,460 --> 02:11:41,893
ED O'KEEFE. 

4076
02:11:41,893 --> 02:11:43,028
YOU TALKED TO VOTERS IN THE 

4077
02:11:43,028 --> 02:11:44,363
STATE EARLIER THIS YEAR ABOUT 

4078
02:11:44,363 --> 02:11:44,963
THE REPUBLICAN SENATE RACE. 

4079
02:11:44,963 --> 02:11:46,064
LET'S GO AHEAD AND LISTEN TO 

4080
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:46,264
THAT. 

4081
02:11:46,264 --> 02:11:48,934
>> WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE 

4082
02:11:48,934 --> 02:11:53,972
PEOPLE RUNNING TO SUCCEED HIM? 

4083
02:11:53,972 --> 02:12:03,849
>> WE'VE GOT KRISTEN CINEMA -- 

4084
02:12:03,849 --> 02:12:04,216
KRISTEN CINEMA. 

4085
02:12:04,216 --> 02:12:05,116
SHE'S -- KYRSTEN SINEMA. 

4086
02:12:05,116 --> 02:12:07,285
>> YOU TALKING ABOUT EITHER 

4087
02:12:07,285 --> 02:12:08,587
PARTY. 

4088
02:12:08,587 --> 02:12:08,853
>> YEAH. 

4089
02:12:08,853 --> 02:12:10,355
ALL OF THEM. 

4090
02:12:10,355 --> 02:12:10,689
>> OKAY. 

4091
02:12:10,689 --> 02:12:13,991
WELL, YOU'VE GOT McSALLY. 

4092
02:12:13,991 --> 02:12:15,693
NUMBER 1, I THINK McSALLY OUGHT 

4093
02:12:15,693 --> 02:12:17,195
TO STAY IN THE DISTRICT TO SAVE 

4094
02:12:17,195 --> 02:12:18,430
THAT SEAT. 

4095
02:12:18,430 --> 02:12:20,799
AND SHE HAD ONLY BEEN THERE TWO 

4096
02:12:20,799 --> 02:12:21,032
YEARS. 

4097
02:12:21,032 --> 02:12:22,434
AND TO RUN FOR A HIGHER OFFICE, 

4098
02:12:22,434 --> 02:12:28,473
I DON'T THINK SHE'S QUALIFIED. 

4099
02:12:28,473 --> 02:12:30,976
THE -- I GOTTA SAY NAME. 

4100
02:12:30,976 --> 02:12:32,210
>> KELLI WARD. 

4101
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:37,149
>> I GOTTA INTERRUPT ANYWAY. 

4102
02:12:37,149 --> 02:12:42,554
>> KELLI WARD IS A LONG-TIME 

4103
02:12:42,554 --> 02:12:42,854
ARIZONAIAN. 

4104
02:12:42,854 --> 02:12:44,155
KNOWS ALL THE ISSUES. 

4105
02:12:44,155 --> 02:12:46,491
BEEN THROUGH IT FOR YEARS. 

4106
02:12:46,491 --> 02:12:48,260
AND WILL I GIVE CREDIT TO HER 

4107
02:12:48,260 --> 02:12:51,396
BEING AN AIR PILOT AND ALL OF 

4108
02:12:51,396 --> 02:12:53,265
TASTUFF? 

4109
02:12:53,265 --> 02:12:55,333
-- THAT STUFF. 

4110
02:12:55,333 --> 02:12:58,970
SINCE I WAS AN INFANTRYMAN, I 

4111
02:12:58,970 --> 02:13:00,872
STICK MORE WITH THE INFANTRYMEN 

4112
02:13:00,872 --> 02:13:01,740
THAN AIR FORCE GUYS. 

4113
02:13:01,740 --> 02:13:06,077
>> I LOVE HEARING FROM VOTERS. 

4114
02:13:06,077 --> 02:13:06,611
WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY? 

4115
02:13:06,611 --> 02:13:08,046
>> THEY DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT 

4116
02:13:08,046 --> 02:13:11,016
THE PEOPLE RUNNING TO REPLACE 

4117
02:13:11,016 --> 02:13:11,316
JEFF FLAKE. 

4118
02:13:11,316 --> 02:13:12,617
THEY MAYBE HEARD THE NAME. 

4119
02:13:12,617 --> 02:13:13,251
BUT UNDERSTANDABLE. 

4120
02:13:13,251 --> 02:13:17,255
BECAUSE WE TALKED TO THEM IN 

4121
02:13:17,255 --> 02:13:18,523
JULY. 

4122
02:13:18,523 --> 02:13:20,959
THAT THEY HADN'T HADN'T FORMED 

4123
02:13:20,959 --> 02:13:22,728
ON WHO WAS RUNNING. 

4124
02:13:22,728 --> 02:13:23,128
WE CAN SEE NOW. 

4125
02:13:23,128 --> 02:13:25,396
WE'RE AN HOUR AND 13 MINUTES 

4126
02:13:25,396 --> 02:13:28,333
AFTER THE POLL CLOSED, THEY'VE 

4127
02:13:28,333 --> 02:13:31,002
DECIDED TO CLOSE THE RESULTS. 

4128
02:13:31,002 --> 02:13:33,171
AND MARKETTA McSAL -- MARTHA 

4129
02:13:33,171 --> 02:13:38,076
McSALLY, AS AMOUNTED, IS THE 

4130
02:13:38,076 --> 02:13:38,276
LEAD. 

4131
02:13:38,276 --> 02:13:40,746
>> YOU KNOW, THE TALK HAD BEEN 

4132
02:13:40,746 --> 02:13:42,581
THE APPEAL ABOUT KELLI WARD AND 

4133
02:13:42,581 --> 02:13:44,616
JOE ARPAIO, OBVIOUSLY TO THOSE 

4134
02:13:44,616 --> 02:13:46,284
IN THE FAR RIGHT OF THE 

4135
02:13:46,284 --> 02:13:46,784
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 

4136
02:13:46,784 --> 02:13:47,352
>> EXTREME RIGHT. 

4137
02:13:47,352 --> 02:13:50,589
>> AND HAVING THIS EFFECT OF 

4138
02:13:50,589 --> 02:13:51,856
SPLITTING THAT FAR RIGHT VOTE. 

4139
02:13:51,856 --> 02:13:52,858
IS THAT POTENTIALLY WHAT WE'RE 

4140
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:58,196
BEGINNING TO SEE HERE, AS YOU 

4141
02:13:58,196 --> 02:13:59,598
SEE MARTHA McSALLY, ENJOYING 

4142
02:13:59,598 --> 02:14:00,798
THIS LEAD AT THIS POINT. 

4143
02:14:00,798 --> 02:14:01,399
OBVIOUSLY, VERY EARLY YET. 

4144
02:14:01,399 --> 02:14:02,467
BUT STILL, HOW MUCH OF A 

4145
02:14:02,467 --> 02:14:03,835
CONCERN WAS THAT? 

4146
02:14:03,835 --> 02:14:07,472
>> TALKING TO FOLKS ON THE 

4147
02:14:07,472 --> 02:14:10,108
GROUND, THEY REALLY FELT THAT 

4148
02:14:10,108 --> 02:14:12,310
WARD AND ARPAIO, OBVIOUSLY, 

4149
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:12,777
WERE VERY SENSATIONAL 

4150
02:14:12,777 --> 02:14:14,780
CANDIDATES. 

4151
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:15,814
THAT WERE ATTRACTED TO THE 

4152
02:14:15,814 --> 02:14:16,114
LIMELIGHT. 

4153
02:14:16,114 --> 02:14:18,150
AND REALLY WERE HOPING THAT THE 

4154
02:14:18,150 --> 02:14:20,318
TRUMP EFFECT WOULD BE MUCH MORE 

4155
02:14:20,318 --> 02:14:21,119
SIGNIFICANT IN THEIR CAMPAIGNS. 

4156
02:14:21,119 --> 02:14:24,689
BUT THAT McSALLY WAS A MUCH 

4157
02:14:24,689 --> 02:14:25,322
MORE TRIED-AND-TRUE, PROVEN 

4158
02:14:25,322 --> 02:14:25,556
LEADER. 

4159
02:14:25,556 --> 02:14:27,225
AND SHE DOES FALL IN THAT 

4160
02:14:27,225 --> 02:14:27,658
ESTABLISHMENT CAMP. 

4161
02:14:27,658 --> 02:14:29,194
BUT THEY FELT A LOT MORE SECURE 

4162
02:14:29,194 --> 02:14:29,527
ABOUT HER. 

4163
02:14:29,527 --> 02:14:31,796
AND THEY FELT SHE COULD RAISE 

4164
02:14:31,796 --> 02:14:32,430
MONEY, BE COMPETITIVE, AND 

4165
02:14:32,430 --> 02:14:34,966
SHE'S IN THE MODEL OF WHAT 

4166
02:14:34,966 --> 02:14:39,137
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF 

4167
02:14:39,137 --> 02:14:39,804
ARIZONA LEADERSHIP. 

4168
02:14:39,804 --> 02:14:40,806
THE STRONG MILITARY SIDE. 

4169
02:14:40,806 --> 02:14:41,640
PRO BUSINESS SIDE. 

4170
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:42,573
KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING. 

4171
02:14:42,573 --> 02:14:44,175
AND CAN HAVE A STRONG STAND ON 

4172
02:14:44,175 --> 02:14:45,777
IMMIGRATION, WHICH IT'S NOT ONE 

4173
02:14:45,777 --> 02:14:46,745
OF THE ISSUES SHE RAISED. 

4174
02:14:46,745 --> 02:14:48,046
BUT THEY DO FEEL THAT SHE WOULD 

4175
02:14:48,046 --> 02:14:51,783
FALL IN LINE WITH, YOU KNOW, 

4176
02:14:51,783 --> 02:14:52,951
ENFORCING THE BORDER, NATIONAL 

4177
02:14:52,951 --> 02:14:53,451
SECURITY PERSPECTIVE. 

4178
02:14:53,451 --> 02:14:55,053
SHE WAS VERY APPEALING ALL THE 

4179
02:14:55,053 --> 02:14:55,353
WAY AROUND. 

4180
02:14:55,353 --> 02:14:57,522
>> THE FACT THAT ALL THREE HAD 

4181
02:14:57,522 --> 02:15:00,025
TO ESSENTIALLY RUN TO EMBRACE 

4182
02:15:00,025 --> 02:15:00,692
PRESIDENT TRUMP, EFFECTIVELY 

4183
02:15:00,692 --> 02:15:02,393
CANCEL OUT THAT ASPECT? 

4184
02:15:02,393 --> 02:15:03,461
>> WELL, THEIR EMBRACE WAS VERY 

4185
02:15:03,461 --> 02:15:05,330
DIFFERENT. 

4186
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:07,999
IT WAS LIKE FROM VERY FAR AWAY. 

4187
02:15:07,999 --> 02:15:09,801
I'M WAVING FROM A WINDOW. 

4188
02:15:09,801 --> 02:15:12,504
ANOTHER WAS LIKE FROM A BEAR 

4189
02:15:12,504 --> 02:15:13,205
HUG. 

4190
02:15:13,205 --> 02:15:13,705
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE 

4191
02:15:13,705 --> 02:15:14,872
PARDONED, IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH 

4192
02:15:14,872 --> 02:15:17,241
APPEAL THAT HAS. 

4193
02:15:17,241 --> 02:15:17,776
JOE ARPAIO, YES. 

4194
02:15:17,776 --> 02:15:20,111
AND SALLY WAS THE TRIED AND 

4195
02:15:20,111 --> 02:15:21,213
TRUE ESTABLISHMENT, THAT GAVE 

4196
02:15:21,213 --> 02:15:23,548
THE MOST CONFIDENCE TO PARTY 

4197
02:15:23,548 --> 02:15:26,818
LEADERS AND TO REPUBLICAN-BASED 

4198
02:15:26,818 --> 02:15:27,151
VOTERS THERE. 

4199
02:15:27,151 --> 02:15:28,820
>> MITCH McCONNELL HAS SAID, 

4200
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:30,789
THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN HOLD THAT 

4201
02:15:30,789 --> 02:15:34,458
SEAT FOR US IS MARTHA McSALLY. 

4202
02:15:34,458 --> 02:15:35,260
>> BECAUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE 

4203
02:15:35,260 --> 02:15:36,695
SEEN IN PRIOR ELECTIONS, IF YOU 

4204
02:15:36,695 --> 02:15:38,430
GO TO EXTREME, IT'S NOT A 

4205
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:39,698
VIABLE CANDIDATE THAT CAN WIN 

4206
02:15:39,698 --> 02:15:40,364
IN GENERAL. 

4207
02:15:40,364 --> 02:15:44,236
>> AND WE SHOULD MENTION, TWO 

4208
02:15:44,236 --> 02:15:45,603
YEARS AGO, KELLI WARD RAN 

4209
02:15:45,603 --> 02:15:48,139
AGAINST JOHN McCAIN. 

4210
02:15:48,139 --> 02:15:48,840
ULTIMATELY ONLY GOT 16%. 

4211
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:50,675
BUT WAS MAKING THE POINT, HER 

4212
02:15:50,675 --> 02:15:52,811
WORDS, NOT OURS, THAT SHE 

4213
02:15:52,811 --> 02:15:54,646
DIDN'T THINK HE WAS HEALTHY 

4214
02:15:54,646 --> 02:15:58,216
ENOUGH TO RUN AGAIN, THAT HE 

4215
02:15:58,216 --> 02:15:58,649
SHOULD STEP ASIDE. 

4216
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:02,053
AND SHE RAN AGAINST JEFF FLAKE, 

4217
02:16:02,053 --> 02:16:04,723
MAKING THE ARGUMENT HE IS 

4218
02:16:04,723 --> 02:16:05,323
INSUFFICIENTLY CONSERVATIVE. 

4219
02:16:05,323 --> 02:16:07,058
BUT DREW A LOT OF NOTORIETY 

4220
02:16:07,058 --> 02:16:09,861
ACROSS THE COUNTRY FOR 

4221
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:10,461
BASICALLY CRITIQUING SENATOR 

4222
02:16:10,461 --> 02:16:11,162
McCAIN'S AGE AND WHETHER OR NOT 

4223
02:16:11,162 --> 02:16:12,430
HE WAS FIT FOR THE JOB. 

4224
02:16:12,430 --> 02:16:16,134
>> AND SHE DID FORCE HIM TO DO 

4225
02:16:16,134 --> 02:16:19,638
ADDITIONAL POLLING, GO OUT AND 

4226
02:16:19,638 --> 02:16:20,939
REACH TO HIS FAN OF 

4227
02:16:20,939 --> 02:16:22,474
CONSERVATIVES, BROADEN THE BASE 

4228
02:16:22,474 --> 02:16:22,774
OF SUPPORT. 

4229
02:16:22,774 --> 02:16:24,008
AND REALLY DIG DOWN INTO THE 

4230
02:16:24,008 --> 02:16:26,044
DATA TO MAKE SURE THEY COULD 

4231
02:16:26,044 --> 02:16:27,111
GET THE TURNOUT MODEL RIGHT. 

4232
02:16:27,111 --> 02:16:29,147
SO IT DID HEIGHTEN THE 

4233
02:16:29,147 --> 02:16:30,849
AWARENESS THAT THIS WAVE, THIS 

4234
02:16:30,849 --> 02:16:32,416
TRUMP EFFECT COULD BE VERY 

4235
02:16:32,416 --> 02:16:33,017
SIGNIFICANT, EVEN FOR McCAIN. 

4236
02:16:33,017 --> 02:16:38,790
>>> THEN WE'RE LOOKING AT 

4237
02:16:38,790 --> 02:16:40,025
TRUMP'S EFFECT IN THESE 

4238
02:16:40,025 --> 02:16:40,325
PRIMARIES. 

4239
02:16:40,325 --> 02:16:45,163
I MEAN, LET'S NOT FORGET, TRUMP 

4240
02:16:45,163 --> 02:16:46,263
COULD NOT SURVIVE ELECTION. 

4241
02:16:46,263 --> 02:16:48,600
IF HE WERE A CRITIC OF DONALD 

4242
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:48,967
TRUMP. 

4243
02:16:48,967 --> 02:16:51,002
AND WE TALKED ABOUT MARTHA 

4244
02:16:51,002 --> 02:16:52,370
McSALLY AS AN ESTABLISHED 

4245
02:16:52,370 --> 02:16:52,670
CANDIDATE. 

4246
02:16:52,670 --> 02:16:52,969
AND SHE IS. 

4247
02:16:52,969 --> 02:16:55,040
BUT SHE HAD TO BACK AWAY FROM 

4248
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:56,907
HER SUPPORT OF DREAM 

4249
02:16:56,907 --> 02:16:58,410
LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE. 

4250
02:16:58,410 --> 02:17:00,344
HER FIRST AD, WAS TALKING ABOUT 

4251
02:17:00,344 --> 02:17:03,448
NOT TAKING THE POLITICALLY 

4252
02:17:03,448 --> 02:17:05,650
CORRECT STANCE. 

4253
02:17:05,650 --> 02:17:07,084
AND CALLING OUT LAWMAKERS AND 

4254
02:17:07,084 --> 02:17:07,451
CONGRESS. 

4255
02:17:07,451 --> 02:17:08,952
VERY MUCH RUNNING IN THAT WAY. 

4256
02:17:08,952 --> 02:17:10,288
AND WE SHOULD ALSO NOTE, TOO, 

4257
02:17:10,288 --> 02:17:12,057
THAT ARIZONA WILL MAKE HISTORY, 

4258
02:17:12,057 --> 02:17:13,624
NO MATTER WHAT, IN NOVEMBER. 

4259
02:17:13,624 --> 02:17:18,463
BECAUSE IT'S NEVER HAD A WOMAN 

4260
02:17:18,463 --> 02:17:21,900
REPRESENTING THE STATE AND THE 

4261
02:17:21,900 --> 02:17:22,133
SENATE. 

4262
02:17:22,133 --> 02:17:24,236
SO ASSUMING ARPAIO DOESN'T WIN, 

4263
02:17:24,236 --> 02:17:26,304
McSALLY AND SINEMA WILL BE 

4264
02:17:26,304 --> 02:17:26,704
QUITE A MATCHUP. 

4265
02:17:26,704 --> 02:17:28,740
>> THE CHALLENGE FOR THE 

4266
02:17:28,740 --> 02:17:29,272
REPUBLICANS IS THE SAME 

4267
02:17:29,272 --> 02:17:30,941
CHALLENGE FOR THE REPUBLICANS 

4268
02:17:30,941 --> 02:17:31,275
IN FLORIDA. 

4269
02:17:31,275 --> 02:17:32,811
THE PRIMARY IN THE REPUBLICAN 

4270
02:17:32,811 --> 02:17:34,712
PARTY IS SOMEWHERE ON PLUTO. 

4271
02:17:34,712 --> 02:17:36,414
SO IT'S THE FIGHT TO GET TO 

4272
02:17:36,414 --> 02:17:36,647
PLUTO. 

4273
02:17:36,647 --> 02:17:37,615
SO NOW, HAVE YOU TO TRY TO 

4274
02:17:37,615 --> 02:17:40,285
FIGHT TO GET BACK TO THE 

4275
02:17:40,285 --> 02:17:40,518
MIDDLE. 

4276
02:17:40,518 --> 02:17:43,221
AND ALSO, CONVINCE THESE PEOPLE 

4277
02:17:43,221 --> 02:17:45,690
IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AND 

4278
02:17:45,690 --> 02:17:46,758
THESE NORMAL VOTERS, NORMAL 

4279
02:17:46,758 --> 02:17:47,290
REPUBLICAN, TRADITIONAL 

4280
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:48,393
REPUBLICAN VOTERS, TO VOTE FOR 

4281
02:17:48,393 --> 02:17:50,995
YOU AT THE SAME TIME. 

4282
02:17:50,995 --> 02:17:53,164
-- [ SIMULTANEOUS SPEAKERS ] 

4283
02:17:53,164 --> 02:17:53,598
>> YEAH. 

4284
02:17:53,598 --> 02:17:55,332
>> BY THE WAY, ANTJUAN. 

4285
02:17:55,332 --> 02:17:56,800
HE'S A DEMOCRAT, CAN YOU TELL. 

4286
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:58,168
>> I MAKE NO APOLOGIES ABOUT T. 

4287
02:17:58,168 --> 02:18:00,438
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE THE 

4288
02:18:00,438 --> 02:18:02,772
CHALLENGE FOR REPUBLICAN VOTERS 

4289
02:18:02,772 --> 02:18:04,941
AND ARIZONANS AND FLORIDA. 

4290
02:18:04,941 --> 02:18:06,477
THE QUESTION WILL BE, WILL 

4291
02:18:06,477 --> 02:18:07,045
MODERATE REPUBLICANS SAY, 

4292
02:18:07,045 --> 02:18:08,313
AUTOBIOGRAPHY, WE'RE GOING TO 

4293
02:18:08,313 --> 02:18:11,182
HOP ON THIS TRAIN AND RIDE WITH 

4294
02:18:11,182 --> 02:18:11,549
OUR CANDIDATE? 

4295
02:18:11,549 --> 02:18:13,251
AND WILL THE EXTREME 

4296
02:18:13,251 --> 02:18:14,285
REPUBLICANS DO THE SAME? 

4297
02:18:14,285 --> 02:18:15,387
OR WILL THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 

4298
02:18:15,387 --> 02:18:16,788
THE SAME PROBLEM THEY HAD IN 

4299
02:18:16,788 --> 02:18:18,323
2016, WHERE YOU HAVE THE FAR 

4300
02:18:18,323 --> 02:18:20,191
WING OR THE PARTY WHO WILL SAY, 

4301
02:18:20,191 --> 02:18:21,259
WE'LL DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. 

4302
02:18:21,259 --> 02:18:23,395
WE'LL RUN A THIRD PARTY 

4303
02:18:23,395 --> 02:18:24,361
CANDIDATE, WE'LL GO SOMEWHERE 

4304
02:18:24,361 --> 02:18:26,064
ELSE, AND SIT IT OUT. 

4305
02:18:26,064 --> 02:18:27,932
IF THAT HAPPENS, THAT GIVES THE 

4306
02:18:27,932 --> 02:18:28,733
POSSIBILITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO 

4307
02:18:28,733 --> 02:18:30,134
MAKE HISTORY IN ARIZONA AND 

4308
02:18:30,134 --> 02:18:32,736
BALK INTO A -- WALK INTO A U.S. 

4309
02:18:32,736 --> 02:18:33,070
SENATE SEAT. 

4310
02:18:33,070 --> 02:18:37,609
>> REMEMBER, JEFF FLAKE OPTED 

4311
02:18:37,609 --> 02:18:39,576
NOT TO RUN PRIMARILY, AND IN 

4312
02:18:39,576 --> 02:18:41,478
THE SHOARM TERM BECAUSE HE 

4313
02:18:41,478 --> 02:18:42,614
FIGURED HE COULDN'T WIN 

4314
02:18:42,614 --> 02:18:43,181
TONIGHT. 

4315
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:45,282
BUT THERE WAS ALSO POLLING 

4316
02:18:45,282 --> 02:18:48,452
SHOWING HIM LOSING TO KYRSTEN 

4317
02:18:48,452 --> 02:18:50,754
SINEMA THAT THE STATE'S GENERAL 

4318
02:18:50,754 --> 02:18:52,590
ELECTION REALITY WAS SUCH THAT 

4319
02:18:52,590 --> 02:18:53,924
A MODERATE DEMOCRATIC WOMAN 

4320
02:18:53,924 --> 02:18:55,360
FROM THE PHOENIX AREA, HAD A 

4321
02:18:55,360 --> 02:18:57,395
BETTER SHOT AT HOLDING A SEAT 

4322
02:18:57,395 --> 02:18:59,197
THAN JEFF FLAKE WHO WAS A ONE-

4323
02:18:59,197 --> 02:18:59,530
TERM SENATOR. 

4324
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:00,531
>> IT GOES BACK TO WHAT I SAID 

4325
02:19:00,531 --> 02:19:02,400
EARLIER. 

4326
02:19:02,400 --> 02:19:02,666
MATCHUPS. 

4327
02:19:02,666 --> 02:19:03,968
POLLICK ITS IS A GAME OF 

4328
02:19:03,968 --> 02:19:04,636
MATCHUPS WHOVMENTD IS ON THE 

4329
02:19:04,636 --> 02:19:08,807
FIELD AT THE SAME TIME, AND HOW 

4330
02:19:08,807 --> 02:19:09,741
DOES THAT PLAY OUT? 

4331
02:19:09,741 --> 02:19:11,509
>> NATIONAL DEMOCRATS LOOKED AT 

4332
02:19:11,509 --> 02:19:16,246
HER RECORD AND SAID, AT THIS 

4333
02:19:16,246 --> 02:19:16,847
TIME, COULD PREVEAL. 

4334
02:19:16,847 --> 02:19:17,214
-- PREVAIL. 

4335
02:19:17,214 --> 02:19:18,716
>> AND AGAIN, PREVAIL, BUT 

4336
02:19:18,716 --> 02:19:20,752
APPLES TO APPLES IN TERMS OF 

4337
02:19:20,752 --> 02:19:22,452
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. 

4338
02:19:22,452 --> 02:19:23,754
THOSE TWO, VERY HIGHLY 

4339
02:19:23,754 --> 02:19:24,722
CONFIDENT WOMEN AGAINST EACH 

4340
02:19:24,722 --> 02:19:24,955
OTHER. 

4341
02:19:24,955 --> 02:19:25,522
AND DETERMINING WHERE THAT 

4342
02:19:25,522 --> 02:19:26,790
FALLS. 

4343
02:19:26,790 --> 02:19:28,293
>> WELL, LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT 

4344
02:19:28,293 --> 02:19:30,361
SENATOR FLAKE AND PRESIDENT 

4345
02:19:30,361 --> 02:19:32,730
TRUMP HAVE SAID ABOUT MOTHER -- 

4346
02:19:32,730 --> 02:19:33,364
MARTHA SALLY. 

4347
02:19:33,364 --> 02:19:35,200
>> I THINK McSALLY WILL WIN. 

4348
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:36,800
I HOPE SHE DOES. 

4349
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:38,436
THAT'S THE ONLY SHOT THAT 

4350
02:19:38,436 --> 02:19:39,070
OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS HAVE TO 

4351
02:19:39,070 --> 02:19:40,772
HOLD ONTO THE SEAT. 

4352
02:19:40,772 --> 02:19:42,340
BUT IT'S EVEN DIFFICULT THEN. 

4353
02:19:42,340 --> 02:19:44,875
THIS IS GOING TO BE A HARD-

4354
02:19:44,875 --> 02:19:45,543
FOUGHT GENERAL ELECTION. 

4355
02:19:45,543 --> 02:19:47,145
>> OKAY. 

4356
02:19:47,145 --> 02:19:48,446
NO SOUND FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 

4357
02:19:48,446 --> 02:19:48,947
APPARENTLY. 

4358
02:19:48,947 --> 02:19:51,282
I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE THAT. 

4359
02:19:51,282 --> 02:19:53,251
BUT YOU KNOW, HARD FOUGHT 

4360
02:19:53,251 --> 02:19:54,552
ELECTION. 

4361
02:19:54,552 --> 02:19:56,754
SO YOU KNOW,ICATE LIN, AS WE 

4362
02:19:56,754 --> 02:19:58,423
LOOK AT THAT MATCHUP, AND WHAT 

4363
02:19:58,423 --> 02:19:59,891
LESLIE JUST TALKED ABOUT, YOU 

4364
02:19:59,891 --> 02:20:00,592
HAVE THESE WOMEN, POTENTIALLY, 

4365
02:20:00,592 --> 02:20:04,462
WHO ARE GOING TO BE FACING EACH 

4366
02:20:04,462 --> 02:20:05,329
OTHER IN THE GENERAL. 

4367
02:20:05,329 --> 02:20:08,233
WHAT DOES IT THAT MEAN, FOR A 

4368
02:20:08,233 --> 02:20:09,566
STATE LIKE ARIZONA? 

4369
02:20:09,566 --> 02:20:10,601
AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. 

4370
02:20:10,601 --> 02:20:11,803
HOW DOES THAT SQUARE UP? 

4371
02:20:11,803 --> 02:20:13,204
>> BRINGS AN IMPORTANT POINT 

4372
02:20:13,204 --> 02:20:19,477
ABOUT THE GENERAL ELECTION AND 

4373
02:20:19,477 --> 02:20:21,246
INSECURITIES THAT THE QUESTIONS 

4374
02:20:21,246 --> 02:20:21,579
ABOUT FLAKE. 

4375
02:20:21,579 --> 02:20:23,214
SECOND OF ALL, THERE IS THIS 

4376
02:20:23,214 --> 02:20:24,048
FEELING, TOO, THAT WHILE YOU 

4377
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:26,518
HAVE TO KIND OF APPEAL TO A 

4378
02:20:26,518 --> 02:20:28,019
CHANGING ELECTORATE, YOU ALSO 

4379
02:20:28,019 --> 02:20:34,392
HAVE TO REALLY DRIVE UP YOUR 

4380
02:20:34,392 --> 02:20:36,060
BASE AND JEFF FLAKE WAS NOT 

4381
02:20:36,060 --> 02:20:37,562
LIKED BY HIS BASE. 

4382
02:20:37,562 --> 02:20:39,697
McSALLY DOES HAVE AN 

4383
02:20:39,697 --> 02:20:40,097
OPPORTUNITY HERE. 

4384
02:20:40,097 --> 02:20:41,266
AND REPUBLICANS CERTAINLY THINK 

4385
02:20:41,266 --> 02:20:42,166
SHE HAS THE BEST ONE. 

4386
02:20:42,166 --> 02:20:44,068
AND SHE CAN REALLY PLAY TO WHAT 

4387
02:20:44,068 --> 02:20:46,137
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE, 

4388
02:20:46,137 --> 02:20:46,570
HER OWN BIOGRAPHY. 

4389
02:20:46,570 --> 02:20:47,805
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT 

4390
02:20:47,805 --> 02:20:48,506
TONIGHT, TOO. 

4391
02:20:48,506 --> 02:20:50,408
WE HEARD THIS FROM GILLUM, KIND 

4392
02:20:50,408 --> 02:20:51,342
OF THIS FREE AIR CAMPAIGN 

4393
02:20:51,342 --> 02:20:54,178
TONIGHT, WHEN THEY CAN MAKE 

4394
02:20:54,178 --> 02:20:54,778
THEIR VICTORY SPEECHES AND 

4395
02:20:54,778 --> 02:20:56,414
INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO THAT 

4396
02:20:56,414 --> 02:20:56,848
GENERAL ELECTORATE. 

4397
02:20:56,848 --> 02:20:59,551
IT GIVES THEM THE CHANCE TO 

4398
02:20:59,551 --> 02:21:00,518
CREATE THEIR OWN BIOGRAPHICAL 

4399
02:21:00,518 --> 02:21:00,885
SPOTS, REALLY. 

4400
02:21:00,885 --> 02:21:01,685
AND TRY TO PLAY THAT UP. 

4401
02:21:01,685 --> 02:21:03,988
AND I THINK WE'LL SEE A LOT OF 

4402
02:21:03,988 --> 02:21:04,555
REPUBLICANS DOING THAT. 

4403
02:21:04,555 --> 02:21:06,758
HOWEVER, ARIZONA IS A BORDER 

4404
02:21:06,758 --> 02:21:07,358
STATE. 

4405
02:21:07,358 --> 02:21:09,260
WE SAW McSALLY ALSO RELEASE 

4406
02:21:09,260 --> 02:21:09,561
ADS. 

4407
02:21:09,561 --> 02:21:11,262
ONE AD, ABOUT BEING TOUGH ON 

4408
02:21:11,262 --> 02:21:12,130
THE BORDER. 

4409
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:13,264
SHE DIDN'T USE THE RHETORIC 

4410
02:21:13,264 --> 02:21:14,165
THAT DONALD TRUMP USES. 

4411
02:21:14,165 --> 02:21:16,267
BUT STILL, IT'S AN ELEMENT WE 

4412
02:21:16,267 --> 02:21:18,403
SAW IN THAT McCAIN AD, A FEW 

4413
02:21:18,403 --> 02:21:20,171
YEARS AGO, SAYING, BUILD THE 

4414
02:21:20,171 --> 02:21:20,471
DANG FENCE. 

4415
02:21:20,471 --> 02:21:22,407
IT'S STILL VERY MUCH, PICKING 

4416
02:21:22,407 --> 02:21:24,608
UP ON WHAT LARRY SABATO SAID. 

4417
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:26,010
AN ISSUE AT LEAST AMONG 

4418
02:21:26,010 --> 02:21:26,343
REPUBLICANS. 

4419
02:21:26,343 --> 02:21:29,647
>> AND WE DO HAVE THAT SOUND 

4420
02:21:29,647 --> 02:21:30,314
NOW, FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

4421
02:21:30,314 --> 02:21:33,017
MARTHA McSALLY, LET'S LISTEN TO 

4422
02:21:33,017 --> 02:21:33,217
THAT. 

4423
02:21:33,217 --> 02:21:33,952
>> THERE'S ANOTHER MEMBER OF 

4424
02:21:33,952 --> 02:21:35,753
CONGRESS HERE TODAY, WHO IS NOT 

4425
02:21:35,753 --> 02:21:37,155
ONLY AN AIR FORCE VETERAN, BUT 

4426
02:21:37,155 --> 02:21:40,725
THE FIRST WOMAN EVER TO FLY A 

4427
02:21:40,725 --> 02:21:41,392
FIGHTER JET IN COMBAT IN U.S. 

4428
02:21:41,392 --> 02:21:43,461
HISTORY. 

4429
02:21:43,461 --> 02:21:45,229
AND I'VE GOTTEN TO KNOW HER 

4430
02:21:45,229 --> 02:21:45,529
VERY WELL. 

4431
02:21:45,529 --> 02:21:47,565
AND SHE IS TERRIFIC. 

4432
02:21:47,565 --> 02:21:50,201
CONGRESSWOMAN MARTHA McSALLY. 

4433
02:21:50,201 --> 02:21:52,136
CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU, 

4434
02:21:52,136 --> 02:21:52,370
MARTHA. 

4435
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:55,640
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. 

4436
02:21:55,640 --> 02:21:57,208
>> SO IT'S INTERESTING, LESLIE. 

4437
02:21:57,208 --> 02:21:57,775
YOU HEARD HIM THERE. 

4438
02:21:57,775 --> 02:22:00,178
AND THAT WAS NOT THAT LONG AGO, 

4439
02:22:00,178 --> 02:22:00,411
RIGHT? 

4440
02:22:00,411 --> 02:22:03,548
THAT WAS JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS 

4441
02:22:03,548 --> 02:22:04,616
AGO. 

4442
02:22:04,616 --> 02:22:06,250
AND YET, NO ACTUAL ENGORSMENT. 

4443
02:22:06,250 --> 02:22:06,617
-- ENDORSEMENT. 

4444
02:22:06,617 --> 02:22:07,151
>> NOT AN ENDORSEMENT. 

4445
02:22:07,151 --> 02:22:08,820
I DON'T THINK SHE WAS 

4446
02:22:08,820 --> 02:22:09,420
AGGRESSIVELY GOING FOR THAT 

4447
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:09,754
ENDORSEMENT. 

4448
02:22:09,754 --> 02:22:11,522
BUT I THINK THERE IS ALSO THE 

4449
02:22:11,522 --> 02:22:13,190
DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW, ESPECIALLY 

4450
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:14,391
SINCE THE PASSING OF SENATOR 

4451
02:22:14,391 --> 02:22:17,595
McCAIN AND THIS RIFT THAT 

4452
02:22:17,595 --> 02:22:18,329
CONTINUOUS -- CONTINUES WITH 

4453
02:22:18,329 --> 02:22:19,464
THE PRESIDENT AND THE DUE 

4454
02:22:19,464 --> 02:22:22,599
RESPECT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN 

4455
02:22:22,599 --> 02:22:22,833
GIVEN. 

4456
02:22:22,833 --> 02:22:24,235
HER FOCUS NOW, LOOKING AT THE 

4457
02:22:24,235 --> 02:22:26,270
STATE, AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT 

4458
02:22:26,270 --> 02:22:28,907
IS PROBABLY -- IT BEHOOVES HER, 

4459
02:22:28,907 --> 02:22:29,907
CERTAINLY POLITICALLY. 

4460
02:22:29,907 --> 02:22:31,342
>> THERE WERE SOME REPORTING 

4461
02:22:31,342 --> 02:22:33,044
TODAY FROM HER FRIENDS AT THE 

4462
02:22:33,044 --> 02:22:33,978
NEW YORK TIMES, SAYING THE 

4463
02:22:33,978 --> 02:22:35,179
McSALLY CAMPAIGN HAD GONE TO 

4464
02:22:35,179 --> 02:22:36,481
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SAID, DO 

4465
02:22:36,481 --> 02:22:39,651
US A FAVOR, AND SIT THIS ONE 

4466
02:22:39,651 --> 02:22:39,984
OUT. 

4467
02:22:39,984 --> 02:22:41,786
AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW AND WE 

4468
02:22:41,786 --> 02:22:43,454
KNOW WE'RE THE BEST SHOT AT 

4469
02:22:43,454 --> 02:22:44,556
HOLDING THIS SEAT. 

4470
02:22:44,556 --> 02:22:46,224
BUT THEN IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, 

4471
02:22:46,224 --> 02:22:48,359
APPARENTLY THEY SAID, HOW ABOUT 

4472
02:22:48,359 --> 02:22:49,193
YOU ENDORSE US NOW? 

4473
02:22:49,193 --> 02:22:50,161
THE WHITE HOUSE SAID NO. 

4474
02:22:50,161 --> 02:22:50,761
AND PART OF THE REASON THEY 

4475
02:22:50,761 --> 02:22:52,664
FIGURED SHE WAS ASKING FOR IT 

4476
02:22:52,664 --> 02:22:54,098
IS SHE ACTUALLY WANTED TO SAVE 

4477
02:22:54,098 --> 02:22:56,467
SOME MONEY, SO SHE DIDN'T HAVE 

4478
02:22:56,467 --> 02:22:58,002
TO KEEP RUNNING ADS AGAINST 

4479
02:22:58,002 --> 02:22:59,037
KELLI WARD AND JOE ARPAIO, AND 

4480
02:22:59,037 --> 02:23:03,808
WOULD BE ABLE TO BANK IT AWAY, 

4481
02:23:03,808 --> 02:23:07,145
TO RUN AGAINST KIRSTEN CINEMA. 

4482
02:23:07,145 --> 02:23:11,683
KIRSTEN CINEMA. 

4483
02:23:11,683 --> 02:23:12,516
-- KYRSTEN SINEMA. 

4484
02:23:12,516 --> 02:23:16,054
THAT NIGHT WAS THE NIGHT HE -- 

4485
02:23:16,054 --> 02:23:18,056
THEY THOUGHT HE WOULD ENDORSE 

4486
02:23:18,056 --> 02:23:18,322
SOMEBODY. 

4487
02:23:18,322 --> 02:23:19,056
HE DIDN'T DO IT. 

4488
02:23:19,056 --> 02:23:22,893
HE MET WITH KELLI WARD. 

4489
02:23:22,893 --> 02:23:26,531
MET WITH SALMON, A BUNCH OF 

4490
02:23:26,531 --> 02:23:27,565
OTHERSES BACKSTAGE. 

4491
02:23:27,565 --> 02:23:30,468
BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. 

4492
02:23:30,468 --> 02:23:32,336
>> AND REMEMBER THAT KYRSTEN 

4493
02:23:32,336 --> 02:23:33,537
SINEMA DIDN'T HAVE A PRIMARY 

4494
02:23:33,537 --> 02:23:33,871
OPPONENT. 

4495
02:23:33,871 --> 02:23:35,506
SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO RUN THIS 

4496
02:23:35,506 --> 02:23:36,941
ENTIRE TIME, GEARING UP TOWARD 

4497
02:23:36,941 --> 02:23:38,342
THE GENERAL ELECTION. 

4498
02:23:38,342 --> 02:23:39,610
THIS WAS ALWAYS A CONCERN WITH 

4499
02:23:39,610 --> 02:23:41,012
REPUBLICANS THAT THE PRIMARY, 

4500
02:23:41,012 --> 02:23:42,914
AT THE END OF AUGUST HERE, 

4501
02:23:42,914 --> 02:23:46,451
WOULD BE KIND OF LONG AND 

4502
02:23:46,451 --> 02:23:46,784
DRAGGED OUT. 

4503
02:23:46,784 --> 02:23:50,121
AND WHILE SINEMA, COULD RUN 

4504
02:23:50,121 --> 02:23:50,621
ESSENTIALLY UNOPPOSED. 

4505
02:23:50,621 --> 02:23:51,522
>> THEY ARE TELLING US WE NEED 

4506
02:23:51,522 --> 02:23:55,560
TO TAKE A BREAK. 

4507
02:23:55,560 --> 02:23:56,227
MUCH MORE ELECTION COVERAGE 

4508
02:23:56,227 --> 02:23:57,261
AHEAD. 

4509
02:23:57,261 --> 02:23:57,661
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 

4510
02:26:42,193 --> 02:26:45,530
>>> HELLO, I'M BILL WHITAKER, 

4511
02:26:45,530 --> 02:26:46,630
WITH "60 MINUTES." 

4512
02:26:46,630 --> 02:26:48,699
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 

4513
02:26:48,699 --> 02:26:49,133
CONGRESSMAN MORENO. 

4514
02:26:49,133 --> 02:26:51,669
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY WHAT IS 

4515
02:26:51,669 --> 02:26:52,336
OUT OF CONTROL. 

4516
02:26:52,336 --> 02:26:54,939
IF WE DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 

4517
02:26:54,939 --> 02:26:55,773
PEOPLE DIE. 

4518
02:26:55,773 --> 02:26:57,074
>> WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN 

4519
02:26:57,074 --> 02:26:57,941
ABOUT THIS WITHOUT 60 MINUTES. 

4520
02:26:57,941 --> 02:26:59,443
>> I DID LOOK INTO THE REPORT. 

4521
02:26:59,443 --> 02:27:02,413
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT VERY 

4522
02:27:02,413 --> 02:27:02,746
SERIOUSLY. 

4523
02:27:02,746 --> 02:27:05,115
>> THEY'RE JUST DRUG DEALERS IN 

4524
02:27:05,115 --> 02:27:05,416
LAB COATS. 

4525
02:27:05,416 --> 02:27:05,983
>> YOU KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 

4526
02:27:05,983 --> 02:27:10,187
PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 

4527
02:27:10,187 --> 02:27:14,292
>>> HE TAUGHT ME THAT HONOR AND 

4528
02:27:14,292 --> 02:27:17,128
IMPERFECT PERFECTION ARE ALWAYS 

4529
02:27:17,128 --> 02:27:17,495
IN COMPETITION. 

4530
02:27:17,495 --> 02:27:20,164
I DO NOT CRY FOR A PERFECT MAN. 

4531
02:27:20,164 --> 02:27:25,469
I CRY FOR A MAN WHO HAD HONOR 

4532
02:27:25,469 --> 02:27:27,003
AND ALWAYS WAS WILLING TO ADMIT 

4533
02:27:27,003 --> 02:27:29,774
TO HIS IMPERFECTION. 

4534
02:27:29,774 --> 02:27:32,109
>> THAT WAS SENATOR LINDSEY 

4535
02:27:32,109 --> 02:27:33,110
GRAHAM, PRAISING HIS FRIEND, 

4536
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:34,778
THE LATE SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. 

4537
02:27:34,778 --> 02:27:38,583
McCAIN'S SEAT WILL BE PICKED BY 

4538
02:27:38,583 --> 02:27:40,284
GOVERNOR DOUG DOUG DUCEY. 

4539
02:27:40,284 --> 02:27:42,687
AND JOINING ME NOW IS NICK 

4540
02:27:42,687 --> 02:27:43,154
CARTER. 

4541
02:27:43,154 --> 02:27:46,156
NICK, LET'S TALK ABOUT ARIZONA 

4542
02:27:46,156 --> 02:27:47,358
GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY, UP FOR RE-

4543
02:27:47,358 --> 02:27:47,624
ELECTION. 

4544
02:27:47,624 --> 02:27:49,694
NOW HE'S GOT TO PICK A 

4545
02:27:49,694 --> 02:27:51,662
REPLACEMENT FOR SENATOR JOHN 

4546
02:27:51,662 --> 02:27:52,029
McCAIN'S SEAT. 

4547
02:27:52,029 --> 02:27:54,365
YOU CALLED THIS A POLITICAL 

4548
02:27:54,365 --> 02:27:56,133
BALANCING ACT. 

4549
02:27:56,133 --> 02:27:57,668
HOW DOES THIS APPOINTMENT 

4550
02:27:57,668 --> 02:27:59,203
COMPLICATE DUCEY'S OWN RE-

4551
02:27:59,203 --> 02:27:59,536
ELECTION BID? 

4552
02:27:59,536 --> 02:28:08,312
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRETTY 

4553
02:28:08,312 --> 02:28:08,912
CONSIENTIAL -- CONSEQUENTIAL 

4554
02:28:08,912 --> 02:28:09,246
ELECTION. 

4555
02:28:09,246 --> 02:28:10,915
HE SAID THERE SHOULDN'T BE 

4556
02:28:10,915 --> 02:28:11,615
ANYTHING UNTIL McCAIN'S BURIAL, 

4557
02:28:11,615 --> 02:28:15,086
WHICH IS GOING TO BE ON SUNDAY. 

4558
02:28:15,086 --> 02:28:16,520
GOVERNOR DUCEY FACES NOMINAL 

4559
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:18,522
OPPOSITION FROM HIS RIGHT IN 

4560
02:28:18,522 --> 02:28:18,989
THE PRIMARY. 

4561
02:28:18,989 --> 02:28:21,158
HIS MAIN WORRY WILL BE THE 

4562
02:28:21,158 --> 02:28:21,859
GENERAL ELECTION. 

4563
02:28:21,859 --> 02:28:24,962
AND HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO, AS 

4564
02:28:24,962 --> 02:28:25,896
I SAID, IN THE REFERENCE, HE'S 

4565
02:28:25,896 --> 02:28:28,165
GOING TO HAVE TO BALANCE A LOT 

4566
02:28:28,165 --> 02:28:29,166
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS. 

4567
02:28:29,166 --> 02:28:30,801
THE McCAIN FAMILY AND THEIR 

4568
02:28:30,801 --> 02:28:32,670
DESIRES IS GOING TO BE ONE OF 

4569
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:33,804
THEM AND A VERY STRONG ONE. 

4570
02:28:33,804 --> 02:28:35,372
THE GOVERNOR HAS GOTTEN A LOT 

4571
02:28:35,372 --> 02:28:37,675
OF PRAISE, FROM PEOPLE CLOSE TO 

4572
02:28:37,675 --> 02:28:39,342
THE LATE SENATOR FOR KEEPING A 

4573
02:28:39,342 --> 02:28:41,512
LID ON SPECULATION. 

4574
02:28:41,512 --> 02:28:42,380
THERE HAS BEEN A NOTABLE LACK 

4575
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:45,583
OF LEAKS. 

4576
02:28:45,583 --> 02:28:47,485
THERE HAS BEEN THE IMPRESSION 

4577
02:28:47,485 --> 02:28:48,419
AMONG A LOT OF POLITICAL 

4578
02:28:48,419 --> 02:28:50,488
PLAYERS, THAT HE IS NOT TALKING 

4579
02:28:50,488 --> 02:28:51,822
TO THE CANDIDATES. 

4580
02:28:51,822 --> 02:28:53,791
HE EVEN SAID THAT IF ANY OF THE 

4581
02:28:53,791 --> 02:28:54,592
CANDIDATES REACHED OUT TO HIM, 

4582
02:28:54,592 --> 02:28:57,161
WHILE JOHN McCAIN WAS STILL 

4583
02:28:57,161 --> 02:28:58,896
ALIVE, THEY'D PROBABLY 

4584
02:28:58,896 --> 02:28:59,396
DISQUALIFY THEMSELVES. 

4585
02:28:59,396 --> 02:29:02,433
AND THAT'S LED TO ESSENTIALLY 

4586
02:29:02,433 --> 02:29:03,768
PEOPLE CREATING HANDICAP LISTS, 

4587
02:29:03,768 --> 02:29:05,269
BUT HIM NOT TIPPING HIS HAND AT 

4588
02:29:05,269 --> 02:29:05,536
ALL. 

4589
02:29:05,536 --> 02:29:07,771
SO HE'S GOT TO BALANCE THE 

4590
02:29:07,771 --> 02:29:08,171
FAMILY'S WISHES. 

4591
02:29:08,171 --> 02:29:11,609
HE'S GOT TO BALANCE THE 

4592
02:29:11,609 --> 02:29:12,743
POLITICAL REALITIES OF ARIZONA 

4593
02:29:12,743 --> 02:29:14,978
STATE, WHERE THE REPUBLICAN 

4594
02:29:14,978 --> 02:29:16,747
PARTY IS FAIRLY DIVIDED, WE'RE 

4595
02:29:16,747 --> 02:29:18,149
SEEING THAT IN THE PRIMARY 

4596
02:29:18,149 --> 02:29:18,449
RIGHT NOW. 

4597
02:29:18,449 --> 02:29:21,552
THERE IS A FACTION THAT THE 

4598
02:29:21,552 --> 02:29:24,555
REPUBLICAN PARTY, IT'S PROBABLY 

4599
02:29:24,555 --> 02:29:27,124
A SIZABLE MINORITY THAT STILL 

4600
02:29:27,124 --> 02:29:29,326
DISLIKES AND IS ANGRY AT 

4601
02:29:29,326 --> 02:29:29,826
SENATOR McCAIN. 

4602
02:29:29,826 --> 02:29:32,930
VERY STRONGLY ANGRY AT HIM. 

4603
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:34,131
NATIONALLY, POLLS GENERALLY 

4604
02:29:34,131 --> 02:29:36,233
SHOW, HE'S MORE FAVORABLY 

4605
02:29:36,233 --> 02:29:38,002
LOOKED UPON BY THE DEMOCRATS 

4606
02:29:38,002 --> 02:29:38,402
THAN REPUBLICANS. 

4607
02:29:38,402 --> 02:29:39,336
AND WHAT THE FAMILY WANTS MAY 

4608
02:29:39,336 --> 02:29:41,672
NOT BE WHAT THE GOVERNOR WANTS. 

4609
02:29:41,672 --> 02:29:44,842
AND GOVERNOR DUCEY WILL NEED 

4610
02:29:44,842 --> 02:29:45,509
THEIR LOYALTY TO WIN RE-

4611
02:29:45,509 --> 02:29:46,010
ELECTION. 

4612
02:29:46,010 --> 02:29:48,612
HE ALSO HAS TO THINK ABOUT, 

4613
02:29:48,612 --> 02:29:50,181
DOES HE APPOINT A CARETAKER, 

4614
02:29:50,181 --> 02:29:51,449
WHO WILL STEP ASIDE AND LET 

4615
02:29:51,449 --> 02:29:52,883
OTHER PEOPLE COMPETE FOR THE 

4616
02:29:52,883 --> 02:29:54,785
SEAT IN 2020, WHEN THE NEXT 

4617
02:29:54,785 --> 02:29:57,254
ELECTION IS SCHEDULED FOR IT? 

4618
02:29:57,254 --> 02:30:00,324
OR DOES HE APPOINT A STRONG 

4619
02:30:00,324 --> 02:30:02,026
CANDIDATE FOR 2020? 

4620
02:30:02,026 --> 02:30:03,294
IN DOING THAT, THAT'S TWO 

4621
02:30:03,294 --> 02:30:03,661
OTHERS. 

4622
02:30:03,661 --> 02:30:05,629
YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER THE 

4623
02:30:05,629 --> 02:30:07,631
FAMILY'S WISHES, VERSUS THE 

4624
02:30:07,631 --> 02:30:09,266
NEEDS IN WASHINGTON. 

4625
02:30:09,266 --> 02:30:10,267
IT'S A NARROWLY DEVOIDED 

4626
02:30:10,267 --> 02:30:12,303
SENATE. 

4627
02:30:12,303 --> 02:30:12,803
YOU -- DIVIDED SENATE. 

4628
02:30:12,803 --> 02:30:14,738
JOHN McCAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS A 

4629
02:30:14,738 --> 02:30:16,874
RELIABLE VOTE FOR PARTY LEADERS 

4630
02:30:16,874 --> 02:30:17,241
IN WASHINGTON. 

4631
02:30:17,241 --> 02:30:19,110
AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT ANGERED 

4632
02:30:19,110 --> 02:30:19,643
THE BASE HERE. 

4633
02:30:19,643 --> 02:30:22,012
IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO IS 

4634
02:30:22,012 --> 02:30:24,315
ELECTABLE IN 2020, YOU NEED TO 

4635
02:30:24,315 --> 02:30:25,249
MAKE SURE THEY'RE NOT 

4636
02:30:25,249 --> 02:30:25,549
PRIMARIED. 

4637
02:30:25,549 --> 02:30:27,685
LIKE JEFF FLAKE HAD TO STOP 

4638
02:30:27,685 --> 02:30:28,619
RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION, 

4639
02:30:28,619 --> 02:30:29,954
BECAUSE OF DANGER OF A PRIMARY. 

4640
02:30:29,954 --> 02:30:31,255
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT 

4641
02:30:31,255 --> 02:30:32,790
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ACCEPTABLE 

4642
02:30:32,790 --> 02:30:33,557
TO THE BASE, BUT THAT THEY'RE 

4643
02:30:33,557 --> 02:30:35,759
ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN A 

4644
02:30:35,759 --> 02:30:36,159
GENERAL ELECTION. 

4645
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:38,428
SO THERE'S A LOT OF COOM 

4646
02:30:38,428 --> 02:30:39,496
PEATING -- COMPETING PRESSURES 

4647
02:30:39,496 --> 02:30:42,066
ON THE GOVERNOR. 

4648
02:30:42,066 --> 02:30:43,367
>> YOU SAID OUT OF RESPECT FOR 

4649
02:30:43,367 --> 02:30:45,603
THE McCAIN FAMILY, HE IS NOT 

4650
02:30:45,603 --> 02:30:46,870
GOING TO NAME A REPLACEMENT, 

4651
02:30:46,870 --> 02:30:50,274
UNTIL THE LATE SENATOR IS LAID 

4652
02:30:50,274 --> 02:30:50,541
TO REST. 

4653
02:30:50,541 --> 02:30:52,510
BUT ARE THERE NUMBER -- NAMES 

4654
02:30:52,510 --> 02:30:52,877
BEING FLOATED? 

4655
02:30:52,877 --> 02:30:57,047
>> THERE ARE NUMBERS OF NAMES 

4656
02:30:57,047 --> 02:30:57,414
BEING FLOATED. 

4657
02:30:57,414 --> 02:30:58,949
ONE THAT IS RECOGNIZED IS THAT 

4658
02:30:58,949 --> 02:31:00,484
OF THE SENATOR'S WIFE, CINDY 

4659
02:31:00,484 --> 02:31:01,519
McCAIN. 

4660
02:31:01,519 --> 02:31:03,854
AND OTHER NAMES -- SHE KIND OF 

4661
02:31:03,854 --> 02:31:05,222
HAS GOTTEN THE MOST ATTENTION. 

4662
02:31:05,222 --> 02:31:06,991
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT THE MOST -- 

4663
02:31:06,991 --> 02:31:09,093
YOU KNOW, THE BEST-KNOWN NAME. 

4664
02:31:09,093 --> 02:31:09,927
THERE'S THE FAMILY CONNECTION. 

4665
02:31:09,927 --> 02:31:12,196
IT IS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR WIDOWS 

4666
02:31:12,196 --> 02:31:14,198
TO BE APPOINTED THROUGHOUT THE 

4667
02:31:14,198 --> 02:31:14,765
REMAINDER OF THEIR LATE 

4668
02:31:14,765 --> 02:31:16,900
HUSBAND'S SENATE SEATS. 

4669
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:19,070
BUT SHE WOULD PROBABLY COME 

4670
02:31:19,070 --> 02:31:20,604
WITH SOME POTENTIAL, YOU KNOW, 

4671
02:31:20,604 --> 02:31:21,572
POTENTIAL BAGGAGE, THE LAST 

4672
02:31:21,572 --> 02:31:25,109
NAME ALONE, MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO 

4673
02:31:25,109 --> 02:31:27,611
INCITE SOME MEMBERS OF THE 

4674
02:31:27,611 --> 02:31:28,044
CONSERVATIVE BASE. 

4675
02:31:28,044 --> 02:31:30,181
AND OTHER NAMES ARE SENATOR JON 

4676
02:31:30,181 --> 02:31:31,582
KYL, FORMER SENATOR JON KYL. 

4677
02:31:31,582 --> 02:31:33,384
HE IS, OF COURSE, THE -- AS 

4678
02:31:33,384 --> 02:31:35,920
THEY CALL IT IN WASHINGTON, THE 

4679
02:31:35,920 --> 02:31:37,521
SHERPA FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH. 

4680
02:31:37,521 --> 02:31:38,322
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 

4681
02:31:38,322 --> 02:31:40,658
SO HE'S NOW TRYING TO MARSHALL 

4682
02:31:40,658 --> 02:31:41,191
THAT THROUGH THE SENATE. 

4683
02:31:41,191 --> 02:31:45,663
HE SEEMS TO HAVE A RATHER BUSY 

4684
02:31:45,663 --> 02:31:46,664
DAY JOB. 

4685
02:31:46,664 --> 02:31:49,299
BUT HIS NAME DOES CIRCULATE 

4686
02:31:49,299 --> 02:31:49,600
FREQUENTLY. 

4687
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:50,934
HE'LL BE SPEAKING AT SENATOR 

4688
02:31:50,934 --> 02:31:55,739
McCAIN'S SERVICE TOMORROW. 

4689
02:31:55,739 --> 02:31:56,139
AND JOHN SHADEC. 

4690
02:31:56,139 --> 02:31:58,776
AND MATT SALMON, TWO REPUBLICAN 

4691
02:31:58,776 --> 02:32:01,245
CONGRESSMEN FROM ARIZONA. 

4692
02:32:01,245 --> 02:32:02,680
EILEEN KLEIN IS THE STATE 

4693
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:02,980
TREASURER. 

4694
02:32:02,980 --> 02:32:04,782
AND SHE IS -- HER NAME COMES UP 

4695
02:32:04,782 --> 02:32:08,285
AS WELL, AS THE SORT OF 

4696
02:32:08,285 --> 02:32:09,486
CANDIDATE WHO WOULD BE MORE -- 

4697
02:32:09,486 --> 02:32:13,624
SOMEBODY WHO COULD RUN IN 2020. 

4698
02:32:13,624 --> 02:32:17,695
KAREN ROBIS SON IS ALSO A 

4699
02:32:17,695 --> 02:32:19,530
DEVELOPER WHO COMES UP 

4700
02:32:19,530 --> 02:32:19,863
OCCASIONALLY. 

4701
02:32:19,863 --> 02:32:20,698
THIS HAS BEEN SPECULATION. 

4702
02:32:20,698 --> 02:32:22,233
THERE HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN MANY 

4703
02:32:22,233 --> 02:32:24,802
HINTS OR TIPS OUT HERE. 

4704
02:32:24,802 --> 02:32:28,172
>> REPUBLICANS HOLD ONLY A 

4705
02:32:28,172 --> 02:32:28,572
SLIGHT MAJORITY. 

4706
02:32:28,572 --> 02:32:30,940
WHAT ARE SOME IMPLICATIONS -- 

4707
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:32,309
>> OBVIOUSLY THE CABINET 

4708
02:32:32,309 --> 02:32:33,076
NOMINATION IS NUMBER 1. 

4709
02:32:33,076 --> 02:32:34,578
PROBABLY THE MAIN ORDER OF 

4710
02:32:34,578 --> 02:32:35,879
BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON THIS 

4711
02:32:35,879 --> 02:32:36,213
FALL. 

4712
02:32:36,213 --> 02:32:37,047
AND I IMAGINE, MOST REPUBLICANS 

4713
02:32:37,047 --> 02:32:38,215
WANT TO BE SURE THAT WHOEVER 

4714
02:32:38,215 --> 02:32:41,284
TAKES THE SEAT IS GOING TO BE A 

4715
02:32:41,284 --> 02:32:44,054
SOLID YES ON KAVANAUGH. 

4716
02:32:44,054 --> 02:32:45,256
OBVIOUSLY, SENATOR McCAIN -- 

4717
02:32:45,256 --> 02:32:49,360
SENATOR McCAIN'S MOST FAMOUS 

4718
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:49,793
AND CONSIENTIAL -- 

4719
02:32:49,793 --> 02:32:51,362
CONSEQUENTIAL VOTE OF THE LAST 

4720
02:32:51,362 --> 02:32:55,232
YEAR WAS THE REPLACEMENT OF THE 

4721
02:32:55,232 --> 02:32:55,732
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 

4722
02:32:55,732 --> 02:32:58,302
WHEN HE VOTED THAT DOWN WITH 

4723
02:32:58,302 --> 02:33:00,303
HIS FAMOUS AFTER-MIDNIGHT 

4724
02:33:00,303 --> 02:33:00,804
THUMBS DOWN. 

4725
02:33:00,804 --> 02:33:01,438
AD HIS REPLACEMENT, THERE 

4726
02:33:01,438 --> 02:33:02,906
WOULD PROBABLY BE A LOT OF 

4727
02:33:02,906 --> 02:33:04,041
PRESSURE TO SOMEBODY WHO WOULD 

4728
02:33:04,041 --> 02:33:06,043
BE COMMITTED TO A FOUL REPEAL 

4729
02:33:06,043 --> 02:33:07,578
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 

4730
02:33:07,578 --> 02:33:09,213
THERE'S -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A 

4731
02:33:09,213 --> 02:33:11,181
NUMBER -- THOSE ARE PROBABLY 

4732
02:33:11,181 --> 02:33:11,849
THE TWO. 

4733
02:33:11,849 --> 02:33:14,418
THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT 

4734
02:33:14,418 --> 02:33:16,754
YOU COULD PROBABLY POINT TO AS 

4735
02:33:16,754 --> 02:33:19,256
POSSIBLE DEFUNDING OF PLANNED 

4736
02:33:19,256 --> 02:33:20,090
PARENTHOOD AND THAT. 

4737
02:33:20,090 --> 02:33:22,960
BUT KAVANAUGH AND THE ACA ARE 

4738
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:24,461
PROBABLY THE TWO MOST 

4739
02:33:24,461 --> 02:33:25,362
CONSEQUENCAL QUESTIONS THAT 

4740
02:33:25,362 --> 02:33:26,931
FACE REPUBLICANS, WHERE THEIR 

4741
02:33:26,931 --> 02:33:27,364
NARROW MAJORITY IS. 

4742
02:33:27,364 --> 02:33:30,267
>> AND WE WANT TO POINT OUT TO 

4743
02:33:30,267 --> 02:33:31,435
VOTERS THERE, THE CBS NEWS 

4744
02:33:31,435 --> 02:33:32,469
PROTECTION THAT GOVERNOR DUCEY 

4745
02:33:32,469 --> 02:33:35,505
HAS WON IN HIS PRIMARY THERE. 

4746
02:33:35,505 --> 02:33:36,139
THAT'S NOT UNEXPECTED, NICK. 

4747
02:33:36,139 --> 02:33:37,141
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH AMONG THE 

4748
02:33:37,141 --> 02:33:40,411
LINES OF WHAT WE HAD THOUGHT 

4749
02:33:40,411 --> 02:33:41,578
GOING INTO THIS NIGHT. 

4750
02:33:41,578 --> 02:33:41,845
>> YEAH. 

4751
02:33:41,845 --> 02:33:47,117
HE -- HE -- HE HAD FAMOUSED A 

4752
02:33:47,117 --> 02:33:47,818
RELATIVELY NEGLIGIBLE PRIMARY 

4753
02:33:47,818 --> 02:33:49,186
OPPOSITION AND HAS BEEN FAIRLY 

4754
02:33:49,186 --> 02:33:49,753
WELL POSITIONED. 

4755
02:33:49,753 --> 02:33:50,988
IT WILL WILL BE INTERESTING TO 

4756
02:33:50,988 --> 02:33:53,090
SEE HOW HE FAIRS IN THE GENERAL 

4757
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:53,390
ELECTION. 

4758
02:33:53,390 --> 02:33:59,129
>> BACK ON THE ISSUE OF FINDING 

4759
02:33:59,129 --> 02:34:00,531
A REPLACEMENT FOR SENATOR 

4760
02:34:00,531 --> 02:34:01,498
SENATOR McEXAIN'S SEAT -- 

4761
02:34:01,498 --> 02:34:01,865
McCAIN'S SEAT. 

4762
02:34:01,865 --> 02:34:04,268
DO WE KNOW IF THE GOVERNOR IS 

4763
02:34:04,268 --> 02:34:06,403
TAKING INPUT FROM LEADERS IN 

4764
02:34:06,403 --> 02:34:08,572
WASHINGTON ON WHO SHOULD FILL 

4765
02:34:08,572 --> 02:34:09,940
THIS VACANCY HAD. 

4766
02:34:09,940 --> 02:34:11,875
>> IT HAS BEEN PLAYED VERY 

4767
02:34:11,875 --> 02:34:12,910
CLOSE TO THE VEST. 

4768
02:34:12,910 --> 02:34:14,077
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE GOOD 

4769
02:34:14,077 --> 02:34:16,513
INSIGHT INTO WHO HE IS TALKING 

4770
02:34:16,513 --> 02:34:16,679
TO. 

4771
02:34:16,679 --> 02:34:18,115
32 HAVE BEEN A COMPLETE LACK OF 

4772
02:34:18,115 --> 02:34:19,182
LEAKS ON THE MATTER. 

4773
02:34:19,182 --> 02:34:21,151
WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, UNUSUAL. 

4774
02:34:21,151 --> 02:34:22,519
PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- PEOPL WHO 

4775
02:34:22,519 --> 02:34:25,255
ARE KIND OF IN THE POLITICAL 

4776
02:34:25,255 --> 02:34:26,990
WORLD, THE REPUBLICAN POLITICAL 

4777
02:34:26,990 --> 02:34:28,592
OPERATIONS OUT HERE, SAY THAT 

4778
02:34:28,592 --> 02:34:30,227
THEY TAKE THE SILENCE TO MEAN 

4779
02:34:30,227 --> 02:34:31,795
THAT HE REALLY HASN'T HAD 

4780
02:34:31,795 --> 02:34:32,429
CONVERSATIONS WITH ANYBODY. 

4781
02:34:32,429 --> 02:34:33,831
AND THAT HE'S STAYING TRUE TO 

4782
02:34:33,831 --> 02:34:34,330
WHAT HE SAID. 

4783
02:34:34,330 --> 02:34:35,132
THAT HE'S GOING TO WAIT FOR THE 

4784
02:34:35,132 --> 02:34:37,134
SENATOR TO BE LAID TO REST, 

4785
02:34:37,134 --> 02:34:37,834
BEFORE HE APPROACHES THE ISSUE. 

4786
02:34:37,834 --> 02:34:41,138
>> WE WANT TO POINT OUT TO OUR 

4787
02:34:41,138 --> 02:34:42,773
VIEWERS, YOU'RE WATCHING LIVE 

4788
02:34:42,773 --> 02:34:44,073
IMAGES THERE OF MARTHA McSALLY. 

4789
02:34:44,073 --> 02:34:46,143
WE SHOULD TELL YOU OTHER 

4790
02:34:46,143 --> 02:34:47,444
ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE, IN FACT, 

4791
02:34:47,444 --> 02:34:48,378
CALLED US FOR HER. 

4792
02:34:48,378 --> 02:34:50,581
WE HAVE NOT YET HERE AT CBS 

4793
02:34:50,581 --> 02:34:50,781
NEWS. 

4794
02:34:50,781 --> 02:34:51,749
BUT LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ABOUT 

4795
02:34:51,749 --> 02:34:53,217
READY TO TAKE TO THE PODIUM. 

4796
02:34:53,217 --> 02:34:54,852
LET'S LISTEN IN. 

4797
02:34:54,852 --> 02:34:57,154
>> WOW. 

4798
02:34:57,154 --> 02:35:03,961
[ APPLAUSE ] 

4799
02:35:03,961 --> 02:35:04,494
>> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY. 

4800
02:35:04,494 --> 02:35:06,296
THANK YOU. 

4801
02:35:06,296 --> 02:35:10,434
WOW. 

4802
02:35:10,434 --> 02:35:11,568
WELL, THANK YOU. 

4803
02:35:11,568 --> 02:35:14,271
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. 

4804
02:35:14,271 --> 02:35:15,973
I'M HUMBLED AND HONORED TO NOW 

4805
02:35:15,973 --> 02:35:18,408
STAND BEFORE YOU FOR THE VERY 

4806
02:35:18,408 --> 02:35:19,843
FIRST TIME AS YOUR REPUBLICAN 

4807
02:35:19,843 --> 02:35:21,245
NOMINEE FOR THE UNITED STATES 

4808
02:35:21,245 --> 02:35:21,678

02:35:36,560 --> 02:35:36,860
CELEBRATE. 

4812
02:35:36,860 --> 02:35:38,228
BUT LET'S KEEP SOMETHING IN 

4813
02:35:38,228 --> 02:35:38,695
MIND. 

4814
02:35:38,695 --> 02:35:39,630
THIS IS NOT OUR OBJECTIVE. 

4815
02:35:39,630 --> 02:35:41,865
OUR MISSION IS IN 70 DAYS. 

4816
02:35:41,865 --> 02:35:42,766
WE HAVE 70 DAYS TO WIN THIS 

4817
02:35:42,766 --> 02:35:47,738
SEAT. 

4818
02:35:47,738 --> 02:35:48,805
AND CANDIDLY, IT'S DIFFICULT TO 

4819
02:35:48,805 --> 02:35:50,341
DIFFICULT TO CELEBRATE ANYTHING 

4820
02:35:50,341 --> 02:35:52,543
THIS WEEK, AS WE MOURN THE LOSS 

4821
02:35:52,543 --> 02:35:53,043
OF SENATOR McCAIN. 

4822
02:35:53,043 --> 02:35:54,111
AND WE PREPARE TO HONOR HIM 

4823
02:35:54,111 --> 02:35:56,446
HERE IN ARIZONA AND IN D.C., 

4824
02:35:56,446 --> 02:35:59,550
BEFORE HE'S LAID TO REST AT 

4825
02:35:59,550 --> 02:35:59,850
ANNAPOLIS. 

4826
02:35:59,850 --> 02:36:02,486
SENATOR McCAIN WAS AN AMERICAN 

4827
02:36:02,486 --> 02:36:03,253
HERO. 

4828
02:36:03,253 --> 02:36:04,188
HE PAID AN UNFATHOMABLE PRICE 

4829
02:36:04,188 --> 02:36:05,956
FOR OUR FREEDOM, AND UPON 

4830
02:36:05,956 --> 02:36:07,090
RETURNING HOME, CONTINUED TO 

4831
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:08,324
SERVE A CONVICTION, HONOR AND 

4832
02:36:08,324 --> 02:36:11,128
SACRIFICE, HIS WHOLE LIFE. 

4833
02:36:11,128 --> 02:36:13,163
FROM EARLY DAYS AS A CADET AT 

4834
02:36:13,163 --> 02:36:15,632
THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY, WE 

4835
02:36:15,632 --> 02:36:17,734
STUDIED HIM, AS AN EXAMPLE OF 

4836
02:36:17,734 --> 02:36:21,138
COURAGE, LEADERSHIP, AND HONOR. 

4837
02:36:21,138 --> 02:36:22,339
SENATOR McCAIN CAME TO AN EVENT 

4838
02:36:22,339 --> 02:36:24,508
FOR ME, WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR 

4839
02:36:24,508 --> 02:36:25,876
CONGRESS. 

4840
02:36:25,876 --> 02:36:27,411
AND HE TOLD THE CROWD THERE 

4841
02:36:27,411 --> 02:36:29,113
THAT THE MAIN DIFFERENCE 

4842
02:36:29,113 --> 02:36:32,082
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US WAS THAT 

4843
02:36:32,082 --> 02:36:33,717
MY TAKEOFFS EQUAL MY LANDINGS. 

4844
02:36:33,717 --> 02:36:34,050
UNLIKE HIM. 

4845
02:36:34,050 --> 02:36:36,520
[ LAUGHTER ] 

4846
02:36:36,520 --> 02:36:38,522
>> AND THAT I SHOOT DOWN 

4847
02:36:38,522 --> 02:36:39,789
AIRPLANES AND HE GETS SHOT 

4848
02:36:39,789 --> 02:36:40,023
DOWN. 

4849
02:36:40,023 --> 02:36:44,695
IN HIS WORDS. 

4850
02:36:44,695 --> 02:36:46,964
HERE WAS THIS LARGER-THAN-LIFE 

4851
02:36:46,964 --> 02:36:48,532
PATRIOT, JOKING ABOUT BEING 

4852
02:36:48,532 --> 02:36:50,300
SHOT DOWN. 

4853
02:36:50,300 --> 02:36:52,335
AND TAKING HIS TIME TO SUPPORT 

4854
02:36:52,335 --> 02:36:53,903
A FELLOW FIGHTER PILOT, WHO 

4855
02:36:53,903 --> 02:36:56,039
FOLLOWED IN HIS FOOTSTEPS. 

4856
02:36:56,039 --> 02:36:57,240
I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HAVE 

4857
02:36:57,240 --> 02:37:00,377
HAD THE CHANCE TO KNOW HIM, TO 

4858
02:37:00,377 --> 02:37:02,346
LEARN FROM HIM, AND TO EACH 

4859
02:37:02,346 --> 02:37:06,149

[ APPLAUSE ] AND IN HIS HONOR, 

4862
02:37:21,164 --> 02:37:22,432
I'D ASK US NOW, PLEASE, JOIN ME

IN A BURQA BATTLE.

02:51:01,617 --> 02:51:03,419

AND WOMEN INTO COMBAT. 

5233

CALLED THAT RACE.

5293
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:22,492
SHE WASTED NO TIME THERE, GOING

5309

5310
02:53:47,049 --> 02:53:50,920

5311
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:51,754

5318
02:54:07,370 --> 02:54:08,438
SHE ALSO TALKED ABOUT BUILDING 

5319
02:54:08,438 --> 02:54:08,704
THE WALL. 

5320
02:54:08,704 --> 02:54:10,173
I DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS GOING 

5321
02:54:10,173 --> 02:54:12,708
TO COME UP IN THIS SPEECH. 

5322
02:54:12,708 --> 02:54:13,876
AND KIND OF ENCAPSULATED THE 

5323
02:54:13,876 --> 02:54:15,845
WHOLE THING WITH HER FAITH AND 

5324
02:54:15,845 --> 02:54:18,314
HOW IMPORTANT THAT HAS BEEN TO 

5325
02:54:18,314 --> 02:54:18,514
HER. 

5326
02:54:18,514 --> 02:54:21,150
SHE IS DEFINITELY SOMEONE WHO 

5327
02:54:21,150 --> 02:54:23,753
IS -- I THINK SHE HAS VERY 

5328
02:54:23,753 --> 02:54:24,353
SMART PEOPLE AROUND HER. 

5329
02:54:24,353 --> 02:54:26,756
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE, WHERE YOU 

5330
02:54:26,756 --> 02:54:27,890
HAVE A NATIONAL PLATFORM. 

5331
02:54:27,890 --> 02:54:29,658
A LOT OF PEOPLE PAYING 

5332
02:54:29,658 --> 02:54:30,493
ATTENTION TO HER. 

5333
02:54:30,493 --> 02:54:33,162
THIS IS ABOUT RAISING MONEY AND 

5334
02:54:33,162 --> 02:54:34,196
GETTING HER EXPOSED THERE. 

5335
02:54:34,196 --> 02:54:37,166
AND INTRODUCING HERSELF TO A 

5336
02:54:37,166 --> 02:54:38,867
MUCH LARGER AUDIENCE. 

5337
02:54:38,867 --> 02:54:39,668
IF YOU CONSIDER MUCH MONEY -- 

5338
02:54:39,668 --> 02:54:42,104
HOW MUCH MONEY IS COMING OUT OF 

5339
02:54:42,104 --> 02:54:44,573
THAT STATE, IT'S VERY 

5340
02:54:44,573 --> 02:54:44,874
IMPACTFUL. 

5341
02:54:44,874 --> 02:54:48,711
>> WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS, 

5342
02:54:48,711 --> 02:54:48,977
ANTJUAN? 

5343
02:54:48,977 --> 02:54:50,746
>> I THINK IT'S SMART FOR HER 

5344
02:54:50,746 --> 02:54:53,382
TO SHIFT THE STRATEGY OF HER 

5345
02:54:53,382 --> 02:54:53,716
CAMPAIGN. 

5346
02:54:53,716 --> 02:54:57,253
KEEP IN MIND, A PRIMARY STRATEG 

5347
02:54:57,253 --> 02:55:00,456
SENAIT AND DAY, COMPARED TO A 

5348
02:55:00,456 --> 02:55:00,889
GENERAL ELECTION. 

5349
02:55:00,889 --> 02:55:02,124
AND SHE HAS OPERATED WITH NO 

5350
02:55:02,124 --> 02:55:04,727
PUNCHES TO HER BAG AT THIS 

5351
02:55:04,727 --> 02:55:04,960
POINT. 

5352
02:55:04,960 --> 02:55:05,494
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE A 

5353
02:55:05,494 --> 02:55:06,862
PRIMARY. 

5354
02:55:06,862 --> 02:55:08,798
SO IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. 

5355
02:55:08,798 --> 02:55:12,034
SO SHE'S USED THIS AS AN 

5356
02:55:12,034 --> 02:55:13,903
OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW REPUBLICAN 

5357
02:55:13,903 --> 02:55:14,604

5358
02:55:14,604 --> 02:55:17,773
SUPPORTERS OF THE TWO MEN SHE 

5359
02:55:17,773 --> 02:55:18,841
RAN AGAINST, SAYING, LOOKING, I 

5360
02:55:18,841 --> 02:55:20,810

5361

BATTLE, I CAN RUN IN THE 

5362
02:55:22,745 --> 02:55:22,978
JUNGLE. 

5363
02:55:22,978 --> 02:55:24,113
AND I THINK SHE WAS TRYING TO 

5364
02:55:24,113 --> 02:55:25,815
PROVE THAT SHE IS WORTHY OF THE 

5365
02:55:25,815 --> 02:55:27,015
NOMINATION, TO THE EXTREME 

5366
02:55:27,015 --> 02:55:28,417
PERSONS IN HER PARTY. 

5367
02:55:28,417 --> 02:55:29,752
>> THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING 

5368
02:55:29,752 --> 02:55:30,119
POINT. 

5369
02:55:30,119 --> 02:55:31,020
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THESE 

5370
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:32,321
CANDIDATES BEFORE, WHERE THEY 

5371
02:55:32,321 --> 02:55:33,823
COME UP AND DO THIS CONTRAST, 

5372
02:55:33,823 --> 02:55:35,424
AND TALK ABOUT THEIR OPTIMISM, 

5373
02:55:35,424 --> 02:55:37,493
THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE MOVING 

5374
02:55:37,493 --> 02:55:38,194
FOR, LAUDING THESE BIG 

5375
02:55:38,194 --> 02:55:40,363
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, THEY HOPE TO 

5376
02:55:40,363 --> 02:55:40,730
BRING TOGETHER. 

5377
02:55:40,730 --> 02:55:42,264
THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS WAS 

5378
02:55:42,264 --> 02:55:42,497
ABOUT. 

5379
02:55:42,497 --> 02:55:43,899
THIS IS ABOUT, I'M A BETTER

5381
02:55:45,801 --> 02:55:47,102

5382
02:55:47,102 --> 02:55:47,904
COMPARED TO MY OPPONENT, THIS 

5383
02:55:47,904 --> 02:55:50,272
IS GOING TO BE A FIGHT THAT I'M 

5384
02:55:50,272 --> 02:55:51,273
READY TO TAKE TO NOVEMBER. 

5385
02:55:51,273 --> 02:55:52,909
>> WELL, LET'S SET THIS AGAINST 

5386
02:55:52,909 --> 02:55:54,043
ALL THE OTHER RACES THIS YEAR. 

5387
02:55:54,043 --> 02:55:57,680

>> NOTABLE. 

5391

>> AND DECIDED BY THE STATES. 

5392
02:56:01,984 --> 02:56:04,153
THAT IS A RECORD HIGH. 

5393
02:56:04,153 --> 02:56:06,455
BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES, 

5394
02:56:06,455 --> 02:56:09,258
HISTORIC IN THEIR OWN RIGHTS. 

5395

MARTHA McSALLY, THE FIRST 

5396
02:56:12,495 --> 02:56:13,629
FEMALE COMBAT FIGHTER PILOT. 

5397
02:56:13,629 --> 02:56:16,799
THAT IN ITSELF IS NOTEWORTHY. 

5398
02:56:16,799 --> 02:56:21,137
ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, SINEMA, 

5399

02:56:23,539 --> 02:56:25,174
IS THE FIRST OPENLY BISEXUAL. 

5401
02:56:25,174 --> 02:56:27,410
IN BOTH CASES, THEY ARE 

5402
02:56:27,410 --> 02:56:27,710
DIVORCEES. 

5403
02:56:27,710 --> 02:56:29,145
SO YOU NOT ONLY HAVE WOMEN 

5404
02:56:29,145 --> 02:56:30,646
RUNNING, BUT WOMEN WHO ARE NOT 

5405
02:56:30,646 --> 02:56:31,079
MARRIED, RUNNING. 

5406
02:56:31,079 --> 02:56:34,750

FIRSTS AND INTERESTING TWISTS 

5408
02:56:36,352 --> 02:56:37,653
AND DEMOGRAPHICS AND GENDER, 

5409
02:56:37,653 --> 02:56:38,320
THAT'S ANOTHER INTERESTING 

5410
02:56:38,320 --> 02:56:38,921
ELEMENT OF THIS RACE. 

5411
02:56:38,921 --> 02:56:40,790
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH 

5412
02:56:40,790 --> 02:56:42,124
MORE PRIMARY COVERAGE IN A 

5413
02:56:42,124 --> 02:56:42,357
MOMENT. 

5414
02:56:42,357 --> 02:56:43,525
BUT FIRST, A QUICK BREAK. 

5415
02:56:43,525 --> 02:56:43,993
STAY WITH US. 

5416
02:56:43,993 --> 02:56:44,393

SERIES CALLED PAY ATTENTION. 

5419

>> JOHN IS OUR GUINEA PIG AS WE 

5420
02:59:48,811 --> 02:59:49,912
EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF 

5421
02:59:49,912 --> 02:59:51,280
TECHNOLOGY ON OUR ABILITY TO 

5422
02:59:51,280 --> 02:59:51,513
FOCUS. 

5423
02:59:51,513 --> 02:59:54,717
>> YOU CAN GO DOWN A RABBIT 

5424
02:59:54,717 --> 02:59:56,185
HOLE THAT TELLS YOU AND HERE 

5425
02:59:56,185 --> 02:59:58,287
I'M GETTING ANOTHER INSTAGRAM 

5426

5427
02:59:58,754 --> 02:59:59,688
TODAY I'VE GONE WITHOUT

02:59:59,688 --> 03:00:00,522
TECHNOLOGY AND INCREASINGLY 

5429
03:00:00,522 --> 03:00:01,791
I'VE HAD THIS HUNTED FEELING. 

5430
03:00:01,791 --> 03:00:03,726
>> YOU'RE STEPPING IN THE WAY 

5431
03:00:03,726 --> 03:00:04,259
OF A HABIT. 

5432
03:00:04,259 --> 03:00:04,559
IT'S HARD. 

5433
03:00:04,559 --> 03:00:06,629
>> HAVING THAT FOCUS BACK WAS 

5434
03:00:06,629 --> 03:00:06,829
NICE. 

5435
03:00:06,829 --> 03:00:08,731
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT THROWING AWAY 

5436
03:00:08,731 --> 03:00:09,031
YOUR PHONE. 

5437
03:00:09,031 --> 03:00:09,631
IT'S ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP 

5438
03:00:09,631 --> 03:00:11,934
WITH YOUR PHONE. 

5439
03:00:26,582 --> 03:00:28,083
>>> HI, I'M ELAINE QUIJANO IN

NEW YORK. 

5441
03:00:28,484 --> 03:00:30,486
IT WAS A BUSY PRIMARY DAY IN 

5442
03:00:30,486 --> 03:00:31,821
ARIZONA AND FLORIDA WHERE 

5443
03:00:31,821 --> 03:00:32,721
VOTERS DECIDED THE MIDTERM 

5444
03:00:32,721 --> 03:00:35,357

5445
03:00:35,357 --> 03:00:36,425

SHE BEAT SHERIFF JOE ARPAIO AND 

5450
03:00:46,936 --> 03:00:47,636
DR. KELLI WARD.

SHE WILL GO UP AGAINST KYRSTEN 

5452
03:00:50,539 --> 03:00:51,607
SINEMA WHO WON HER PRIMARY. 

5453
03:00:51,607 --> 03:00:52,908
THIS WAS THE RACE TO FILL 

5454
03:00:52,908 --> 03:00:56,111
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE'S SEAT AFTER 

5455
03:00:56,111 --> 03:00:56,879

SENATOR JOHN McCAIN'S SEAT. 

5460
03:01:03,118 --> 03:01:05,321
THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WON'T BE MADE 

5461
03:01:05,321 --> 03:01:05,988
UNTIL AFTER McCAIN'S BURIAL, 

5462
03:01:05,988 --> 03:01:08,023
BUT THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT OF 

5463
03:01:08,023 --> 03:01:11,327
THE NIGHT CAME FROM FLORIDA 

5464
03:01:11,327 --> 03:01:13,228

YOU'LL SEE A MUCH DIFFERENT 

5524
03:02:58,834 --> 03:03:00,536
KYRSTEN SINEMA, ONE WHO HAS 

5525
03:03:00,536 --> 03:03:02,104
MOVED MUCH MORE TO THE CENTER 

5526
03:03:02,104 --> 03:03:03,672
SINCE THE DAYS SHE WAS OUT 

5527
03:03:03,672 --> 03:03:04,139

5528
03:03:04,139 --> 03:03:06,208

03:03:08,510 --> 03:03:11,513
LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS. 

5531
03:03:11,513 --> 03:03:13,482
SHE IS NOT GOING TO BE 

5532
03:03:13,482 --> 03:03:13,782
PARTISAN. 

5533
03:03:13,782 --> 03:03:15,317
SHE DOESN'T SEE THIS AS A 

5534
03:03:15,317 --> 03:03:18,487
REFERENDUM ON DONALD TRUMP AND 

5535
03:03:18,487 --> 03:03:23,025
WANTS TO WORK FOR ARIZONANS.

AT THIS MOMENT SINEMA IS 

5537
03:03:23,758 --> 03:03:26,194
LEADING IN MOST OF THE POLLS, 

5538
03:03:26,194 --> 03:03:28,130

03:03:31,033 --> 03:03:31,733
IN THE LAST WEEK. 

5542
03:03:31,733 --> 03:03:34,403
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

5543
03:03:34,403 --> 03:03:34,836
GOVERNOR'S RACE. 

5544
03:03:34,836 --> 03:03:37,139
ARIZONA GOVERNOR DOUG DUCEY WON 

5545
03:03:37,139 --> 03:03:37,672
HIS PRIMARY. 

5546
03:03:37,672 --> 03:03:38,707
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES 

5547
03:03:38,707 --> 03:03:40,542
HE'S FACING IN THE GENERAL 

5548
03:03:40,542 --> 03:03:40,809
ELECTION? 

5549
03:03:40,809 --> 03:03:42,176
>> AGAIN, I THINK IT'S SORT OF 

5550
03:03:42,176 --> 03:03:44,413
THE OVERHANG OF DONALD TRUMP ON 

5551
03:03:44,413 --> 03:03:45,014
THE ELECTORATE. 

5552
03:03:45,014 --> 03:03:46,615
HOWEVER, DUCEY WILL HAVE A LOT 

5553
03:03:46,615 --> 03:03:46,881
OF MONEY. 

5554
03:03:46,881 --> 03:03:49,585
HE'LL HAVE A LOT OF INDEPENDENT 

5555
03:03:49,585 --> 03:03:50,018
CAMPAIGN SUPPORT. 

5556
03:03:50,018 --> 03:03:51,020
DAVID GARCIA WAS RUNNING ALMOST 

5557
03:03:51,020 --> 03:03:53,088
OUT OF MONEY JUST TO WIN THIS 

5558
03:03:53,088 --> 03:03:53,355
PRIMARY. 

5559
03:03:53,355 --> 03:03:56,425
I DON'T KNOW HE'LL BE IN A 

5560
03:03:56,425 --> 03:04:00,462
POSITION TO MOUNT A VERY 

5561
03:04:00,462 --> 03:04:02,231
SERIOUS EFFORT AGAINST DOUG 

5562
03:04:02,231 --> 03:04:02,531
DUCEY. 

5563
03:04:02,531 --> 03:04:03,165
THE BIG CHALLENGE FOR DEMOCRATS 

5564
03:04:03,165 --> 03:04:06,335
IN ARIZONA IS THEY ARE TRAILING 

5565
03:04:06,335 --> 03:04:07,636
INDEPENDENTS IN TERMS OF VOTER 

5566
03:04:07,636 --> 03:04:08,270
REGISTRATION AT THIS POINT. 

5567
03:04:08,270 --> 03:04:10,339
WE HEAR EVERY YEAR THIS IS THE 

5568
03:04:10,339 --> 03:04:11,306
YEAR DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO 

5569
03:04:11,306 --> 03:04:13,574
COME BACK AND WIN IN ARIZONA. 

5570
03:04:13,574 --> 03:04:15,543
WE'LL MAKE THIS A PURPLE STATE. 

5571
03:04:15,543 --> 03:04:17,212
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE WATCHING 

5572
03:04:17,212 --> 03:04:19,515
LUCY WITH THE FOOTBALL. 

5573
03:04:19,515 --> 03:04:25,087
>> ON THAT POINT, JANET THAT 

5574
03:04:25,087 --> 03:04:30,626
PAL TAN OWE -- NAPALITANO OF 

5575
03:04:30,626 --> 03:04:32,060
THE LAST DEMOCRAT TO SERVE. 

5576
03:04:32,060 --> 03:04:35,731
WHO ARE WE LOOKING AT NOW? 

5577
03:04:35,731 --> 03:04:37,032
>> DAVID GARCIA, WHO WAS 

5578
03:04:37,032 --> 03:04:38,333

CLOSEST TO WINNING A RACE IN

TO GO OVER THE TOP WITH A 

5586
03:04:49,711 --> 03:04:51,847
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO 

5587
03:04:51,847 --> 03:04:57,252
ACTUALLY BARELY LEFT THEIR

HOW IS THAT RACE SHAPING UP? 

5595
03:05:11,567 --> 03:05:12,668

TO SOUTHERN ARIZONA AND APPEARS 

5599
03:05:17,806 --> 03:05:25,314
TO BE WINNING THAT PRIMARY.

5600
03:05:25,314 --> 03:05:26,615
SHE IS A TERRIFIC FUNDRAISER 

5601
03:05:26,615 --> 03:05:28,517
AND HAS WON VERY TIGHT RACES 

5602
03:05:28,517 --> 03:05:28,817
BEFORE. 

5603
03:05:28,817 --> 03:05:30,486

SHE HAS BEEN THE LEADER OF THE 

5608

HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 

5609
03:05:39,327 --> 03:05:40,729
SHE'S BEEN VERY POLITICALLY 

5610
03:05:40,729 --> 03:05:41,129
CONNECTED. 

5611
03:05:41,129 --> 03:05:42,531
SHE WAS NOT A TRUMP PERSON 

5612
03:05:42,531 --> 03:05:45,734
BEFORE SHE GOT INTO THIS RACE. 

5613
03:05:45,734 --> 03:05:48,737
SHE WAS MORE OF A MARCO RUBIO 

5614
03:05:48,737 --> 03:05:50,505
REPUBLICAN, BUT SHE HAS SINCE 

5615
03:05:50,505 --> 03:05:53,274
BEEN A LOT MORE FRIENDLY TO THE 

5616
03:05:53,274 --> 03:05:53,708
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA. 

5617
03:05:53,708 --> 03:05:55,244
SHE'S BEEN REALLY DODGING THE 

5618
03:05:55,244 --> 03:05:57,212
PRESS SINCE SHE LOST THIS 

5619
03:05:57,212 --> 03:05:57,479
CAMPAIGN. 

5620
03:05:57,479 --> 03:05:58,446
>> ALL RIGHT. 

5621
03:05:58,446 --> 03:06:00,515

WE HEARD JIM TALK ABOUT SOME OF 

5628
03:06:10,425 --> 03:06:11,159
THE DYNAMICS THERE. 

5629
03:06:11,159 --> 03:06:15,130
IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU THINK 

5630
03:06:15,130 --> 03:06:17,132
ABOUT SPECIFICALLY THE KYRSTEN 

5631
03:06:17,132 --> 03:06:18,133

CONTRAST ALREADY ARE TRYING TO 

5635
03:06:24,473 --> 03:06:25,507
BASICALLY FRAME THIS CONTEST 

5636
03:06:25,507 --> 03:06:27,009
DRAWING UPON HER OWN EXPERIENCE 

5637
03:06:27,009 --> 03:06:30,112
AS A FIGHTER PILOT TO KIND OF 

5638
03:06:30,112 --> 03:06:32,414
PRESENT HERSELF AS THE OPTION 

5639
03:06:32,414 --> 03:06:33,715

TO FIGHT AND LET'S TAKE A 

5641
03:06:36,018 --> 03:06:38,220
LISTEN ACTUALLY TO SOME OF WHAT 

5642
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:38,820
McSALLY HAD TO SAY. 

5643
03:06:38,820 --> 03:06:41,590
>> IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN A DOER 

5644
03:06:41,590 --> 03:06:44,526
AND A TALKER, BETWEEN A PATRIOT 

5645
03:06:44,526 --> 03:06:47,362
AND A PROTESTER, BETWEEN A 

5646
03:06:47,362 --> 03:06:50,832
CAREER FIGHTER PILOT AND A 

5647
03:06:50,832 --> 03:06:52,367
CAREER POLITICIAN, BETWEEN

PROVEN GRIT AND HOLLYWOOD 

5649
03:06:53,268 --> 03:06:55,103
GLITZ. 

5650
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:55,504
>> OKAY. 

5651
03:06:55,504 --> 03:06:57,005
SO PRETTY TOUGH LANGUAGE HERE 

5652
03:06:57,005 --> 03:06:58,507
AND RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE, 

5653
03:06:58,507 --> 03:07:00,909
BASICALLY A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S 

5654
03:07:00,909 --> 03:07:01,176
TO COME. 

5655
03:07:01,176 --> 03:07:02,911
>> MARTHA McSALLY HAS HAD TO 

5656
03:07:02,911 --> 03:07:04,913
FOCUS THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS 

5657
03:07:04,913 --> 03:07:06,615
ON HER REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS IN 

5658
03:07:06,615 --> 03:07:07,716
HOPES OF PRESERVING HER WIN 

5659
03:07:07,716 --> 03:07:08,216
TONIGHT. 

5660
03:07:08,216 --> 03:07:10,118
SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS 

5661
03:07:10,118 --> 03:07:11,920
ON KYRSTEN SINEMA AND WITH SO 

5662
03:07:11,920 --> 03:07:13,121
FEW WEEKS UNTIL THE ELECTION 

5663
03:07:13,121 --> 03:07:16,625
SHE CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE ANY 

5664
03:07:16,625 --> 03:07:17,659
TIME TRYING TO DEFINE SINEMA. 

5665
03:07:17,659 --> 03:07:19,728
YOU TALK TO DEMOCRATS AND 

5666
03:07:19,728 --> 03:07:20,629
REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY 

5667
03:07:20,629 --> 03:07:22,931
WHO MONITOR THESE THINGS AND 

5668
03:07:22,931 --> 03:07:24,265
THEY POINT OUT KYRSTEN SINEMA 

5669
03:07:24,265 --> 03:07:26,334
HAS GOTTEN A PRETTY FREE PASS. 

5670
03:07:26,334 --> 03:07:29,204
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A SERIOUS 

5671
03:07:29,204 --> 03:07:30,539
PRIMARY OPPONENT AND HAS SORT 

5672
03:07:30,539 --> 03:07:31,806
OF BEEN THE ANOINTED CANDIDATE 

5673
03:07:31,806 --> 03:07:33,008
MORE THAN A YEAR AND THERE'S 

5674
03:07:33,008 --> 03:07:36,511
BEEN NO PUSH TO GO AFTER HER 

5675
03:07:36,511 --> 03:07:37,111
BACKGROUND WHICH POLITICALLY 

5676
03:07:37,111 --> 03:07:38,513
HAS SHIFTED FROM BEING SORT OF 

5677
03:07:38,513 --> 03:07:40,215
A FAR LEFT LIBERAL OPPONENT OF 

5678
03:07:40,215 --> 03:07:42,117
THE IRAQ WAR TO NOW THIS 

5679
03:07:42,117 --> 03:07:43,418
MODERATE DEMOCRAT WHO HAS 

5680
03:07:43,418 --> 03:07:44,820
SERVED ABLY FROM THE PHOENIX 

5681
03:07:44,820 --> 03:07:45,721
AREA THE LAST SEVERAL CYCLES 

5682
03:07:45,721 --> 03:07:52,994
AND HAS BEEN SEEN AS A FOR 

5683
03:07:52,994 --> 03:07:55,630
MIDDIBLE STATEWIDE CANDIDATE.  

5684
03:07:55,630 --> 03:07:56,531
-- FORMIDABLE STATEWIDE 

5685
03:07:56,531 --> 03:07:57,265
CANDIDATE. 

5686
03:07:57,265 --> 03:07:58,667
MEANWHILE DEMOCRATS SAY McSALLY 

5687
03:07:58,667 --> 03:08:00,869
HAS FLIP-FLOPPED STARTING AS A 

5688
03:08:00,869 --> 03:08:01,503
MODERATE MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN 

5689
03:08:01,503 --> 03:08:02,504
TRYING TO EMBRACE THE POLICIES 

5690
03:08:02,504 --> 03:08:04,005
OF THE PRESIDENT AND SHE IS NOT 

5691
03:08:04,005 --> 03:08:06,208
EXACTLY WHAT SHE SETS HERSELF 

5692
03:08:06,208 --> 03:08:06,641
UP TO BE. 

5693
03:08:06,641 --> 03:08:08,043
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ATTACK 

5694
03:08:08,043 --> 03:08:10,812
EACH OTHER IN WAYS THAT A MALE 

5695
03:08:10,812 --> 03:08:13,615
OPPONENT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 

5696
03:08:13,615 --> 03:08:14,816
ATTACK THEM REGARDING THEIR 

5697
03:08:14,816 --> 03:08:15,517
BACKGROUND, THEIR PROFESSIONAL 

5698
03:08:15,517 --> 03:08:15,917
HISTORY. 

5699
03:08:15,917 --> 03:08:19,054
WE HEARD A LITTLE OF THAT 

5700
03:08:19,054 --> 03:08:22,190
TONIGHT FROM MARTHA McSALLY 

5701
03:08:22,190 --> 03:08:23,258
GOING AFTER SINEMA'S SUIT 

5702
03:08:23,258 --> 03:08:23,558
COLLECTION. 

5703
03:08:23,558 --> 03:08:25,060
NO MALE CANDIDATE WOULD EVER GO 

5704
03:08:25,060 --> 03:08:25,293
THERE. 

5705
03:08:25,293 --> 03:08:26,794
>> YOU MIGHT DO IT TO ME. 

5706
03:08:26,794 --> 03:08:28,763
>> YOU AND I COULD DO THAT. 

5707
03:08:28,763 --> 03:08:29,063
>> RIGHT. 

5708
03:08:29,063 --> 03:08:30,065
HER COMMENT WAS SOMETHING ALONG 

5709
03:08:30,065 --> 03:08:32,434
THE LINES OF SHE SAID SHE HAS 

5710
03:08:32,434 --> 03:08:33,768
OVER 100 PAIRS OF SHOES. 

5711
03:08:33,768 --> 03:08:35,404
I HAVE OVER 100 COMBAT 

5712
03:08:35,404 --> 03:08:36,571
MISSIONS. 

5713
03:08:36,571 --> 03:08:38,240
WHAT ABOUT THAT LINE OF ATTACK, 

5714
03:08:38,240 --> 03:08:38,473
ANTWAN? 

5715
03:08:38,473 --> 03:08:39,307
THERE IS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO 

5716
03:08:39,307 --> 03:08:41,309
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO 

5717
03:08:41,309 --> 03:08:41,742
FEMALE CANDIDATES. 

5718
03:08:41,742 --> 03:08:45,013
>> IT'S CUTE AND MIGHT GET HER 

5719
03:08:45,013 --> 03:08:45,881
A FEW NOTIFICATIONS. 

5720
03:08:45,881 --> 03:08:47,516
THE BOTTOM LINE IS FOR THIS 

5721
03:08:47,516 --> 03:08:49,217
RACE THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE 

5722
03:08:49,217 --> 03:08:52,220
ONLY RACES IN THE COUNTRY WHERE 

5723
03:08:52,220 --> 03:08:53,922
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 

5724
03:08:53,922 --> 03:08:55,023
SERIOUS CONVERSATION AND DEBATE 

5725
03:08:55,023 --> 03:08:58,760
ABOUT ISSUES BECAUSE YOU HAVE 

5726
03:08:58,760 --> 03:08:59,260
TWO FEMALE CANDIDATES. 

5727
03:08:59,260 --> 03:09:00,462
YOU HAVE TWO QUALIFIED FEMALE 

5728
03:09:00,462 --> 03:09:02,764
CANDIDATES WHO BOTH HAVE TRACK 

5729
03:09:02,764 --> 03:09:04,065
RECORDS OF BEING GOOD LEADERS 

5730
03:09:04,065 --> 03:09:06,068
FOR BOTH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE 

5731
03:09:06,068 --> 03:09:06,635
PARTIES. 

5732
03:09:06,635 --> 03:09:07,869
NOW ISSUES COME INTO PLAY. 

5733
03:09:07,869 --> 03:09:10,639
THIS IS WHERE I THINK THE 

5734
03:09:10,639 --> 03:09:11,707
DEMOCRATS POSSIBLY COULD HAVE 

5735
03:09:11,707 --> 03:09:13,508
THE UPTICK IN THIS RACE BECAUSE 

5736
03:09:13,508 --> 03:09:15,243
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ISSUES AND 

5737
03:09:15,243 --> 03:09:17,312
IF DEMOCRATS DO THEIR JOB OF 

5738
03:09:17,312 --> 03:09:21,550
TYING HER TO THE PRESIDENT AND 

5739
03:09:21,550 --> 03:09:22,617
THE FAILED REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, 

5740
03:09:22,617 --> 03:09:23,652
THAT GIVES THIS WINDOW OF 

5741
03:09:23,652 --> 03:09:24,719
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC 

5742
03:09:24,719 --> 03:09:26,021
CANDIDATE TO SAY WHAT THE 

5743
03:09:26,021 --> 03:09:28,656
DEMOCRATS WILL DO AND WHAT SHE 

5744
03:09:28,656 --> 03:09:31,393
IS FOR, NOT NECESSARILY ONLY 

5745
03:09:31,393 --> 03:09:32,861
AGAINST TRUMP AND I THINK THAT 

5746
03:09:32,861 --> 03:09:34,295
PRESENTS A REAL OPPORTUNITY. 

5747
03:09:34,295 --> 03:09:36,064
>> WHAT ABOUT, LESLIE, WHAT WE 

5748
03:09:36,064 --> 03:09:38,266
HEARD FROM MARTHA McSALLY WAS 

5749
03:09:38,266 --> 03:09:40,969
ESSENTIALLY THE ARGUMENT BASED 

5750
03:09:40,969 --> 03:09:44,406
ON HER EXPERIENCE IN COMBAT, 

5751
03:09:44,406 --> 03:09:45,106
BASED ON HER OWN LIFE 

5752
03:09:45,106 --> 03:09:47,008
EXPERIENCE IN THE BIOGRAPHY SHE 

5753
03:09:47,008 --> 03:09:48,210
WAS PRESENTED TO HER SUPPORTERS 

5754
03:09:48,210 --> 03:09:50,712
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO FACING 

5755
03:09:50,712 --> 03:09:52,614
DIFFICULT ISSUES AMONG THEM 

5756
03:09:52,614 --> 03:09:53,715
IMMIGRATION OBVIOUSLY IN A 

5757
03:09:53,715 --> 03:10:02,890
STATE LIKE ARIZONA THAT SHE'S ú 

5758
03:10:02,890 --> 03:10:05,193
TO DO THAT. 

5759
03:10:05,193 --> 03:10:06,628
HOW RESONANT DO YOU THINK THAT 

5760
03:10:06,628 --> 03:10:08,963
WILL BE FOR ARIZONA VOTERS? 

5761
03:10:08,963 --> 03:10:09,430
>> EXTREMELY VOTERS. 

5762
03:10:09,430 --> 03:10:10,832
SHE IS GOING TO WIN LOOKING 

5763
03:10:10,832 --> 03:10:12,534
MORE LIKE SHE IS IN LINE WITH 

5764
03:10:12,534 --> 03:10:14,769
THE PRESIDENT THAN SHE IS 

5765
03:10:14,769 --> 03:10:15,236
LOOKING INDEPENDENT. 

5766
03:10:15,236 --> 03:10:16,338
THAT'S KIND OF BEEN THE 

5767
03:10:16,338 --> 03:10:18,507
CHALLENGE WHERE THE STATE IS 

5768
03:10:18,507 --> 03:10:18,773
TURNING. 

5769
03:10:18,773 --> 03:10:20,208
SHE HAS TO LOOK STRONG, LIKE 

5770
03:10:20,208 --> 03:10:22,711
SHE HAS A TRACK RECORD, 

5771
03:10:22,711 --> 03:10:23,111
FORMIDABLE. 

5772
03:10:23,111 --> 03:10:24,913
SHE WILL MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS 

5773
03:10:24,913 --> 03:10:25,914
AND I WILL PREDICT THERE'S 

5774
03:10:25,914 --> 03:10:28,116
GOING TO BE AN AREA WHERE SHE 

5775
03:10:28,116 --> 03:10:28,817
HAS TO SHOW SOME INDEPENDENCE 

5776
03:10:28,817 --> 03:10:30,886
WHERE SHE CAN MAKE THE TOUGH 

5777
03:10:30,886 --> 03:10:32,020
CHOICE BASED ON PROTECTING 

5778
03:10:32,020 --> 03:10:33,354
ARIZONA AS OPPOSED TO LOCK STEP 

5779
03:10:33,354 --> 03:10:34,122
WITH THE PRESIDENT. 

5780
03:10:34,122 --> 03:10:35,423
YOU'LL HEAR A LOT OF THAT 

5781
03:10:35,423 --> 03:10:36,525
VERSUS HER OPPONENT WHO WILL 

5782
03:10:36,525 --> 03:10:40,862
START TO SOUND LIKE MORE OF A 

5783
03:10:40,862 --> 03:10:41,495
CENTRIST AND REPUBLICAN LIGHT. 

5784
03:10:41,495 --> 03:10:43,765
YOU NEVER WIN WHEN YOU'RE KIND 

5785
03:10:43,765 --> 03:10:44,666
OF THE WEAKER OR DILUTED 

5786
03:10:44,666 --> 03:10:47,335
VERSION OF THE OTHER PARTY AS 

5787
03:10:47,335 --> 03:10:48,003
OPPOSED TO THE PROGRESSIVE 

5788
03:10:48,003 --> 03:10:49,538
CONTRAST, WHICH IS STILL A VERY 

5789
03:10:49,538 --> 03:10:50,906
DIFFICULT ROAD TO WIN IN SOME 

5790
03:10:50,906 --> 03:10:53,308
OF THESE, BUT IN A VERY RED 

5791
03:10:53,308 --> 03:10:56,077
STATE LIKE ARIZONA SHE'S TAKING 

5792
03:10:56,077 --> 03:10:56,577
EXACTLY THE RIGHT TONE. 

5793
03:10:56,577 --> 03:10:57,612
IT'S FUNNY IN SOME OF THESE 

5794
03:10:57,612 --> 03:11:01,750
ATTACKS AND I THINK IT'S MORE 

5795
03:11:01,750 --> 03:11:03,919
THAN THE KIND OF SASSY 100 

5796
03:11:03,919 --> 03:11:05,921
SHOES, 100 COMBAT MISSIONS, I 

5797
03:11:05,921 --> 03:11:09,758
THINK THAT'S A VERY SHARP ARROW 

5798
03:11:09,758 --> 03:11:12,461
DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY TO POINT 

5799
03:11:12,461 --> 03:11:14,696
OUT THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK 

5800
03:11:14,696 --> 03:11:17,199
SUBURBAN WOMEN WILL RESPOND TO. 

5801
03:11:17,199 --> 03:11:20,569
IT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE POINT 

5802
03:11:20,569 --> 03:11:24,973
OF SUBSTANCE VERSUS KIND OF THE 

5803
03:11:24,973 --> 03:11:25,406
TIME AND MOVEMENT. 

5804
03:11:25,406 --> 03:11:27,642
IT HAS A DIFFERENT TONE TO IT 

5805
03:11:27,642 --> 03:11:29,611
AND I THINK THAT CAN REALLY 

5806
03:11:29,611 --> 03:11:30,311
PLAY AND BE EFFECTIVE. 

5807
03:11:30,311 --> 03:11:33,148
>> SO I DISAGREE A LITTLE BIT 

5808
03:11:33,148 --> 03:11:36,017
WITH YOU, LESLIE, WITH ALL DUE 

5809
03:11:36,017 --> 03:11:36,283
RESPECT. 

5810
03:11:36,283 --> 03:11:37,552
>> ONLY A LITTLE? 

5811
03:11:37,552 --> 03:11:37,752
GOOD. 

5812
03:11:37,752 --> 03:11:39,020
FIVE HOURS LATER IT'S ONLY A 

5813
03:11:39,020 --> 03:11:39,253
LITTLE. 

5814
03:11:39,253 --> 03:11:41,222
>> BECAUSE YOU ALL ON THE 

5815
03:11:41,222 --> 03:11:42,324
REPUBLICAN SIDE ACCUSED CONOR 

5816
03:11:42,324 --> 03:11:45,260
LAMB AND DOUG JONES OF BEING 

5817
03:11:45,260 --> 03:11:45,961
SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY RAN 

5818
03:11:45,961 --> 03:11:48,163
REPUBLICANLIKE CAMPAIGNS AND 

5819
03:11:48,163 --> 03:11:48,896
RAN ON REPUBLICANLIKE ISSUES. 

5820
03:11:48,896 --> 03:11:49,831
>> WE DID SAY THAT. 

5821
03:11:49,831 --> 03:11:51,933
>> NOW ON THE COUNTER SIDE 

5822
03:11:51,933 --> 03:11:52,867
YOU'RE SAYING THAT DOESN'T 

5823
03:11:52,867 --> 03:11:53,268
WORK. 

5824
03:11:53,268 --> 03:11:56,137
SO I DISAGREE WITH YOU A LITTLE 

5825
03:11:56,137 --> 03:11:56,237
BIT. 

5826
03:11:57,205 --> 03:11:59,107
THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT 

5827
03:11:59,107 --> 03:12:00,542
WILL BE VERY CRITICAL IN THIS 

5828
03:12:00,542 --> 03:12:06,514
RACE IS HOW WILL THE McCAIN 

5829
03:12:06,514 --> 03:12:08,617
MACHINE RESPOND TO A PRO TRUMP 

5830
03:12:08,617 --> 03:12:09,217
TYPE CANDIDATE? 

5831
03:12:09,217 --> 03:12:10,118
WE KNOW TRUMP, FLAKE, ET 

5832
03:12:10,118 --> 03:12:11,753
CETERA, THAT WING OF THE 

5833
03:12:11,753 --> 03:12:17,659
REPUBLICAN PARTY IN ARIZONA 

5834
03:12:17,659 --> 03:12:19,928
HAVE NOT CUDDLED AND PLAYED 

5835
03:12:19,928 --> 03:12:20,562
FOOTSY WITH THE PRESIDENT. 

5836
03:12:20,562 --> 03:12:21,429
SO HOW ENTHUSIASTIC WILL THEY 

5837
03:12:21,429 --> 03:12:23,064
BE TRYING TO TURN OUT THEIR 

5838
03:12:23,064 --> 03:12:24,666
MODEL OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS TO 

5839
03:12:24,666 --> 03:12:26,368
SUPPORT THE NOMINEE OR WILL 

5840
03:12:26,368 --> 03:12:27,669
THEY TAKE A CHILL PILL, SIT 

5841
03:12:27,669 --> 03:12:29,804
BACK AND WAIT IT OUT TO FOCUS 

5842
03:12:29,804 --> 03:12:31,406
ON TRYING TO PUT THEIR NOMINEE 

5843
03:12:31,406 --> 03:12:32,540
IN THE McCAIN SEAT? 

5844
03:12:32,540 --> 03:12:35,143
THOSE ARE DYNAMICS WE CAN'T 

5845
03:12:35,143 --> 03:12:37,378
FIGURE OUT THIS EARLY ON. 

5846
03:12:37,378 --> 03:12:39,447
NO ONE CAN GUARANTEE THE McCAIN 

5847
03:12:39,447 --> 03:12:41,816
OR FLAKE MACHINE WILL BE ALL IN 

5848
03:12:41,816 --> 03:12:42,817
FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, 

5849
03:12:42,817 --> 03:12:44,319
PARTICULARLY IF SHE STARTS TO 

5850
03:12:44,319 --> 03:12:45,720
RUN A VERY PRO TRUMP STYLE 

5851
03:12:45,720 --> 03:12:46,621
CAMPAIGN. 

5852
03:12:46,621 --> 03:12:48,924
>> I THINK THERE'S A PRAGMATISM 

5853
03:12:48,924 --> 03:12:51,059
ESPECIALLY AMONG PARTY LEADERS 

5854
03:12:51,059 --> 03:12:52,326
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THESE ARE 

5855
03:12:52,326 --> 03:12:53,361
FUNDAMENTALLY POLITICIANS WHO 

5856
03:12:53,361 --> 03:12:55,529
ARE TRYING TO READ THE TEA 

5857
03:12:55,529 --> 03:12:58,432
LEAVES IN TERMS OF WHERE THE 

5858
03:12:58,432 --> 03:12:58,866
STATE IS GOING. 

5859
03:12:58,866 --> 03:13:00,535
THAT'S A FINGER TO THE WIND IN 

5860
03:13:00,535 --> 03:13:00,835
THAT SENSE. 

5861
03:13:00,835 --> 03:13:03,604
SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE McCAIN 

5862
03:13:03,604 --> 03:13:06,207
OPERATIVES TRIED AND TRUE, BEEN 

5863
03:13:06,207 --> 03:13:08,643
HERE SO LONG. %

5864
03:13:08,643 --> 03:13:10,812
THAT FORMULA IS NOT WORKING 

5865
03:13:10,812 --> 03:13:13,614
ANYMORE AND SENATOR FLAKE RAN 

5866
03:13:13,614 --> 03:13:14,582
INTO THAT HEADWIND. 

5867
03:13:16,217 --> 03:13:17,719
SO THIS NEW DYNAMIC, I THINK 

5868
03:13:17,719 --> 03:13:18,420
THERE'S GOING TO BE 

5869
03:13:18,420 --> 03:13:21,122
FAVORABILITY TO HER AS 

5870
03:13:21,122 --> 03:13:22,857
REPUBLICANS TO PROTECT THE 

5871
03:13:22,857 --> 03:13:23,057
SEAT. 

5872
03:13:23,057 --> 03:13:23,624
SHE'S CERTAINLY COMPETENT, 

5873
03:13:23,624 --> 03:13:25,260
VIABLE AND CAN BE A STRONG 

5874
03:13:25,260 --> 03:13:25,493
LEADER. 

5875
03:13:25,493 --> 03:13:27,862
LOOKING AHEAD SHE'S THAT NEXT 

5876
03:13:27,862 --> 03:13:29,164
GENERATION OF YOUNG LEADERS. 

5877
03:13:29,164 --> 03:13:31,466
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST 

5878
03:13:31,466 --> 03:13:31,866
POSITIVE ASPECT. 

5879
03:13:31,866 --> 03:13:32,767
>> IT'S INTERESTING, ED, 

5880
03:13:32,767 --> 03:13:34,269
BECAUSE HEARING THAT BUT ALSO 

5881
03:13:34,269 --> 03:13:35,537
THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU HAD 

5882
03:13:35,537 --> 03:13:37,505
SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE FACT 

5883
03:13:37,505 --> 03:13:39,441
THAT MITCH MCCONNELL, WHEN 

5884
03:13:39,441 --> 03:13:42,610
LOOKING AT THE LANDSCAPE OF THE 

5885
03:13:42,610 --> 03:13:44,512
GOP CANDIDATES, RIGHT, LOOKED 

5886
03:13:44,512 --> 03:13:45,647
AT MARTHA McSALLY AS REALLY 

5887
03:13:45,647 --> 03:13:49,517
BEING THEIR OPTION AND YET IT'S 

5888
03:13:49,517 --> 03:13:50,150
A TRUMP FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT. 

5889
03:13:50,150 --> 03:13:52,120
SO YOU HAVE THIS INTERSECTION 

5890
03:13:52,120 --> 03:13:54,022
OF THE ESTABLISHMENT AS 

5891
03:13:54,022 --> 03:13:56,558
EMBODIED BY MITCH McCONNELL 

5892
03:13:56,558 --> 03:14:00,095
BASICALLY SAYING THIS IS THE 

5893
03:14:00,095 --> 03:14:00,528
PERSON WE WANT. 

5894
03:14:00,528 --> 03:14:03,064
YOU HAVE THEN PEOPLE WHO 

5895
03:14:03,064 --> 03:14:05,166
WOULD BE SYMPATHETIC AND 

5896
03:14:05,166 --> 03:14:08,570
SUPPORT VERY MUCH TRUMP 

5897
03:14:08,570 --> 03:14:10,438
POLICIES ALSO GOING TO A MARTHA 

5898
03:14:10,438 --> 03:14:11,239
McSALLY. 

5899
03:14:11,239 --> 03:14:12,741
>> BUT LOOK AT THESE NUMBERS. 

5900
03:14:12,741 --> 03:14:15,009
SHE'S WON ROUGHLY 50% OF THE 

5901
03:14:15,009 --> 03:14:16,244
PRIMARY ELECTORATE. 

5902
03:14:16,244 --> 03:14:18,613
THE OTHER TWO WOULD HAVE GOTTEN 

5903
03:14:18,613 --> 03:14:18,813
48%. 

5904
03:14:18,813 --> 03:14:20,315
THAT SUGGESTS A FAIR AMOUNT OF 

5905
03:14:20,315 --> 03:14:20,582
STRENGTH. 

5906
03:14:20,582 --> 03:14:22,951
IN THE COUNTY LEVEL SHE DID 

5907
03:14:22,951 --> 03:14:24,952
JUST FINE IN MARICOPA COUNTY. 

5908
03:14:24,952 --> 03:14:27,522
SHE WON A MAJORITY THERE AND A 

5909
03:14:27,522 --> 03:14:28,323
MAJORITY IN THE NEIGHBORING 

5910
03:14:28,323 --> 03:14:28,623
COUNTIES. 

5911
03:14:28,623 --> 03:14:29,791
THAT SUGGESTS HER BASE OF 

5912
03:14:29,791 --> 03:14:31,359
SUPPORT IN THE POPULATION 

5913
03:14:31,359 --> 03:14:33,261
CENTERS ARE STRONG ENOUGH THAT 

5914
03:14:33,261 --> 03:14:35,062
THEY BELIEVE TAKING THAT BASE 

5915
03:14:35,062 --> 03:14:36,264
OF SUPPORT, ADDING INDEPENDENT 

5916
03:14:36,264 --> 03:14:37,465
VOTERS AND MAYBE SOME MODERATE 

5917
03:14:37,465 --> 03:14:40,368
DEMOCRATS WHO DON'T LIKE THE 

5918
03:14:40,368 --> 03:14:41,469
IDEA OF KYRSTEN SINEMA BECAUSE 

5919
03:14:41,469 --> 03:14:43,338
MAYBE THESE ATTACKS ON HER 

5920
03:14:43,338 --> 03:14:44,339
CHARACTER AND PERSONALITY WILL 

5921
03:14:44,339 --> 03:14:46,007
STICK AND THEY BELIEVE SHE CAN 

5922
03:14:46,007 --> 03:14:46,273
DO THAT. 

5923
03:14:46,273 --> 03:14:48,910
KELLI WARD WON'T BE ABLE TO DO 

5924
03:14:48,910 --> 03:14:49,210
IT. 

5925
03:14:49,210 --> 03:14:49,844
JOE ARPAIO DEFINITELY WAS NOT 

5926
03:14:49,844 --> 03:14:52,079
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. 

5927
03:14:52,079 --> 03:14:55,517
THEY BELIEVE McSALLY WAS THEIR 

5928
03:14:55,517 --> 03:14:56,951
BEST SHOT AGAINST SINEMA WHO 

5929
03:14:56,951 --> 03:14:59,120
HAS POLLED QUITE WELL FOR ABOUT 

5930
03:14:59,120 --> 03:15:00,755
18 MONTHS IN A HYPOTHETICAL 

5931
03:15:00,755 --> 03:15:02,023
MATCH-UP WITH McSALLY, JEFF 

5932
03:15:02,023 --> 03:15:03,158
FLAKE OR ANYBODY ELSE. 

5933
03:15:03,158 --> 03:15:05,193
>> BUT TO YOUR POINT EARLIER, 

5934
03:15:05,193 --> 03:15:05,960
HE, SHE'S BEEN POLLING STRONG 

5935
03:15:05,960 --> 03:15:11,366
BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN NO REAL 

5936
03:15:11,366 --> 03:15:11,766
ATTACKS ON HER. 

5937
03:15:11,766 --> 03:15:13,468
JUST LIKE FLORIDA AND A LOT OF 

5938
03:15:13,468 --> 03:15:15,737
OTHER PLACES I DON'T KNOW IF WE 

5939
03:15:15,737 --> 03:15:17,171
CAN MEASURE THE ENTHUSIASM GAP, 

5940
03:15:17,171 --> 03:15:18,640
NO. 

5941
03:15:18,640 --> 03:15:23,244
1, TO BE ANTI-TRUMP. 

5942
03:15:23,244 --> 03:15:24,412
IT'S EASIER TO VOTE AGAINST 

5943
03:15:24,412 --> 03:15:25,947
SOMETHING THAN FOR SOMETHING, 

5944
03:15:25,947 --> 03:15:27,749
NOR CAN WE ACCURATELY MEASURE 

5945
03:15:27,749 --> 03:15:29,250
THE CHANGE IN DYNAMICS IN THE 

5946
03:15:29,250 --> 03:15:29,850
POPULATION OF THE STATE. 

5947
03:15:29,850 --> 03:15:31,653
>> YOU GUYS TALK ABOUT THAT 

5948
03:15:31,653 --> 03:15:33,254
EVERY TWO YEARS AND IT HASN'T 

5949
03:15:33,254 --> 03:15:35,056
MANIFESTED ITSELF AND YOU KNOW 

5950
03:15:35,056 --> 03:15:35,256
THAT. 

5951
03:15:35,256 --> 03:15:35,957
>> IT HASN'T YET. 

5952
03:15:35,957 --> 03:15:37,759
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY EVERY 

5953
03:15:37,759 --> 03:15:38,059
TWO YEARS. 

5954
03:15:38,059 --> 03:15:39,761
>> CHANGE IS SLOW AND IF YOU 

5955
03:15:39,761 --> 03:15:41,062
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN 

5956
03:15:41,062 --> 03:15:43,064
FLORIDA AND WHAT HAPPENED IN 

5957
03:15:43,064 --> 03:15:44,299
THE GEORGIA PRIMARY, YOU WILL 

5958
03:15:44,299 --> 03:15:45,700
SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN. 

5959
03:15:45,700 --> 03:15:46,367
CHANGE DOES NOT HAPPEN 

5960
03:15:46,367 --> 03:15:46,667
OVERNIGHT. 

5961
03:15:46,667 --> 03:15:51,139
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT FLORIDA

5962
03:15:51,139 --> 03:15:54,576
BECAUSE THERE'S A FASCINATING 

5963
03:15:54,576 --> 03:15:55,076
DYNAMIC THERE. 

5964
03:15:55,076 --> 03:15:57,745
ANDREW GILLUM PULLED OFF AN 

5965
03:15:57,745 --> 03:15:58,046
UPSET. 

5966
03:15:58,046 --> 03:15:58,346
>> CHANGE. 

5967
03:15:58,346 --> 03:15:59,847
>> THESE AREN'T REPUBLICAN OR 

5968
03:15:59,847 --> 03:16:00,281
DEMOCRATIC ISSUES. 

5969
03:16:00,281 --> 03:16:01,549
THE JOB OF THE GOVERNOR OF THE 

5970
03:16:01,549 --> 03:16:05,653
STATE OF FLORIDA IS TO DO WHAT 

5971
03:16:05,653 --> 03:16:08,056
IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE 

5972
03:16:08,056 --> 03:16:09,823
PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA. 

5973
03:16:09,823 --> 03:16:11,893
I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING THAT 

5974
03:16:11,893 --> 03:16:12,260
GOVERNOR. 

5975
03:16:12,260 --> 03:16:17,198
>> I WANT TO BRING IN JIM 

5976
03:16:17,198 --> 03:16:19,667
DEFEDE IN MIAMI, A POLITICAL 

5977
03:16:19,667 --> 03:16:20,201
CORRESPONDENT WITH WFOR. 

5978
03:16:20,201 --> 03:16:21,169
JIM, TELL US ABOUT THIS STORY 

5979
03:16:21,169 --> 03:16:24,939
LINE OF THE NIGHT IN FLORIDA, 

5980
03:16:24,939 --> 03:16:26,741
ANDREW GILLUM PULLING OFF 

5981
03:16:26,741 --> 03:16:30,178
SOMETHING EVEN DEMOCRATS IN THE 

5982
03:16:30,178 --> 03:16:31,746
STATE DIDN'T NECESSARILY COUNT 

5983
03:16:31,746 --> 03:16:31,912
ON. 

5984
03:16:31,912 --> 03:16:32,146
>> NO. 

5985
03:16:32,146 --> 03:16:33,848
THIS WORD GETS USED WAY TOO 

5986
03:16:33,848 --> 03:16:42,524
OFTEN THESE DAYS, BUT THIS WAS 

5987
03:16:42,524 --> 03:16:53,334
A HISTORIC NIGHT.

5988
03:16:53,334 --> 03:16:55,069
THE LAST FIVE GOVERNOR RACES 

5989
03:16:55,069 --> 03:16:56,871
THAT LOST EVERY TIME WERE WITH 

5990
03:16:56,871 --> 03:16:58,773
MODERATE DEMOCRATS FROM THE 

5991
03:16:58,773 --> 03:16:59,440
TAMPA BAY AREA. 

5992
03:16:59,440 --> 03:17:00,742
ANDREW GILLUM IS NOT A MODERATE 

5993
03:17:00,742 --> 03:17:01,843
DEMOCRAT FROM TAMPA BAY. 

5994
03:17:01,843 --> 03:17:03,878
HE'S AN AFRICAN AMERICAN, PROUD 

5995
03:17:03,878 --> 03:17:04,946
PROGRESSIVE LIBERAL CANDIDATE 

5996
03:17:04,946 --> 03:17:09,217
FROM TALLAHASSEE WITH ROOTS IN 

5997
03:17:09,217 --> 03:17:09,584
SOUTH FLORIDA. 

5998
03:17:09,584 --> 03:17:10,551
SO THE GEORGE SORROWS AND TOM 

5999
03:17:10,551 --> 03:17:12,153
STEYER WING OF THE PARTY REALLY 

6000
03:17:12,153 --> 03:17:13,855
TRIED TO PUMP HIM UP, GIVE HIM 

6001
03:17:13,855 --> 03:17:15,456
THE SUPPORT HE NEEDED TO HANG 

6002
03:17:15,456 --> 03:17:18,026
IN THERE WITH THE MILLIONAIRES 

6003
03:17:18,026 --> 03:17:20,495
AND BILLIONAIRES HE RAN 

6004
03:17:20,495 --> 03:17:20,761
AGAINST. 

6005
03:17:20,761 --> 03:17:21,696
THAT HELPED HIM A GREAT DEAL. 

6006
03:17:21,696 --> 03:17:22,897
BERNIE SANDERS COMING INTO THE 

6007
03:17:22,897 --> 03:17:24,599
STATE HELPED HIM A GREAT DEAL. 

6008
03:17:24,599 --> 03:17:27,001
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE FACT 

6009
03:17:27,001 --> 03:17:28,569
ANDREW GILLUM HAD NO NEGATIVE 

6010
03:17:28,569 --> 03:17:31,472
ADS RUN AGAINST HIM, WHICH WAS 

6011
03:17:31,472 --> 03:17:33,241
REALLY A FASCINATING DYNAMIC. 

6012
03:17:33,241 --> 03:17:34,575
ALL THE OTHER CANDIDATES SPENT 

6013
03:17:34,575 --> 03:17:36,678
TENS AND TENS OF MILLIONS OF 

6014
03:17:36,678 --> 03:17:39,580
DOLLARS ATTACKING EACH OTHER, 

6015
03:17:39,580 --> 03:17:41,950
JEFF GREEN ATTACKING GWEN 

6016
03:17:41,950 --> 03:17:44,319
GRAHAM, GWEN GRAHAM ATTACKING 

6017
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:45,854
PHIL LEVINE, PHIL LEVINE 

6018
03:17:45,854 --> 03:17:47,388
ATTACKING JEFF GREEN, ON AND ON 

6019
03:17:47,388 --> 03:17:48,956
AND ON, BUT NOBODY ATTACKED 

6020
03:17:48,956 --> 03:17:51,225
ANDREW GILLUM BECAUSE IN LARGE 

6021
03:17:51,225 --> 03:17:54,595
PART THE POLLS HAD GILLUM LOW 

6022
03:17:54,595 --> 03:17:55,296
AROUND THIRD AND FOURTH PLACE 

6023
03:17:55,296 --> 03:17:56,898
AND TWO, I THINK A CALCULATION 

6024
03:17:56,898 --> 03:17:58,565
WAS MADE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TRY 

6025
03:17:58,565 --> 03:18:00,401
TO WIN BY ATTACKING AN AFRICAN 

6026
03:18:00,401 --> 03:18:01,102
AMERICAN CANDIDATE KNOWING YOU 

6027
03:18:01,102 --> 03:18:05,139
WOULD NEED THAT AFRICAN 

6028
03:18:05,139 --> 03:18:06,073
AMERICAN VOTE IN NOVEMBER. 

6029
03:18:06,073 --> 03:18:07,775
WELL, THEY STAYED AWAY FROM HIM 

6030
03:18:07,775 --> 03:18:09,277
AND NOW HE'S THE NOMINEE AND 

6031
03:18:09,277 --> 03:18:11,179
WHAT YOU'RE SURE TO SEE IS THIS 

6032
03:18:11,179 --> 03:18:12,246
IS THE RACE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN 

6033
03:18:12,246 --> 03:18:13,348
WANTING ALL ALONG IN THE LEFT 

6034
03:18:13,348 --> 03:18:15,850
WING OF THE PARTY IN FLORIDA. 

6035
03:18:15,850 --> 03:18:17,485
THEY WANTED A PROGRESSIVE 

6036
03:18:17,485 --> 03:18:19,687
CANDIDATE TO CHALLENGE THEIR 

6037
03:18:19,687 --> 03:18:19,887
RACE. 

6038
03:18:19,887 --> 03:18:21,256
>> JIM, THE CONTRAST COULD NOT 

6039
03:18:21,256 --> 03:18:23,291
BE MORE STARK GOING INTO 

6040
03:18:23,291 --> 03:18:23,791
NOVEMBER HERE. 

6041
03:18:23,791 --> 03:18:26,294
YOU HAVE GOT ON THE DEMOCRATIC 

6042
03:18:26,294 --> 03:18:27,528
SIDE IN IN GUBERNATORIAL RACE 

6043
03:18:27,528 --> 03:18:28,396
ANDREW GILLUM AND ON THE 

6044
03:18:28,396 --> 03:18:32,200
REPUBLICAN SIDE YOU HAVE A 

6045
03:18:32,200 --> 03:18:34,702
TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATE IN 

6046
03:18:34,702 --> 03:18:36,637
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTOS. 

6047
03:18:36,637 --> 03:18:38,239
DESCRIBE THAT CONTRAST FOR US. 

6048
03:18:38,239 --> 03:18:39,374
>> HERE'S A SIMPLE NUTSHELL 

6049
03:18:39,374 --> 03:18:41,842
THAT SORT OF GETS TO IT. 

6050
03:18:41,842 --> 03:18:43,578
ANDREW GILLUM GOT INTO POLITICS 

6051
03:18:43,578 --> 03:18:49,651
IN LARGE POT INSPIRED BY BARACK 

6052
03:18:49,651 --> 03:18:49,884
OBAMA. 

6053
03:18:49,884 --> 03:18:51,152
RON DESANTOS WROTE A BOOK THAT 

6054
03:18:51,152 --> 03:18:52,854
WAS BASICALLY A REPUTATION OF 

6055
03:18:52,854 --> 03:18:55,189
OBAMA IN WHICH HE ENTITLED HIS 

6056
03:18:55,189 --> 03:18:57,592
BOOK DREAMS OF OUR FOUNDING 

6057
03:18:57,592 --> 03:18:57,992
FATHERS. 

6058
03:18:57,992 --> 03:19:00,328
SO YOU HAVE TWO CANDIDATES, ONE 

6059
03:19:00,328 --> 03:19:00,995
WHO IS PROUDLY CONSERVATIVE IN 

6060
03:19:00,995 --> 03:19:03,531
VIEW POINT, THE OTHER WHO IS 

6061
03:19:03,531 --> 03:19:04,899
PROUDLY PROGRESSIVE IN HIS AND 

6062
03:19:04,899 --> 03:19:07,402
THE FIGHT NOW IS OVER HOW YOU 

6063
03:19:07,402 --> 03:19:09,570
ATTRACT THAT VOTE IN THE CENTER 

6064
03:19:09,570 --> 03:19:11,773
OR IS IT THE WAY SOME DEMOCRATS 

6065
03:19:11,773 --> 03:19:12,673
BELIEVE OR THE REPUBLICANS 

6066
03:19:12,673 --> 03:19:14,675
WELL, IS THIS JUST A BASE 

6067
03:19:14,675 --> 03:19:14,975
ELECTION? 

6068
03:19:14,975 --> 03:19:17,145
DO YOU JUST BRING OUT THE BASE 

6069
03:19:17,145 --> 03:19:18,579
IN HUGE NUMBERS AND LET THE 

6070
03:19:18,579 --> 03:19:20,848
MIDDLE GROUND SORT OF SORT I 

6071
03:19:20,848 --> 03:19:21,182
OUT? 

6072
03:19:21,182 --> 03:19:22,683
>> JIM, IT'S ED O'KEEFE AGAIN. 

6073
03:19:22,683 --> 03:19:29,190
WHERE IN THE STATE IS EITHER OF 

6074
03:19:29,190 --> 03:19:40,101
THESE GUYS GOING TO WIN?

6075
03:19:40,101 --> 03:19:41,903
>> DEMOCRATS WILL RACK UP WINS 

6076
03:19:41,903 --> 03:19:44,372
IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF 

6077
03:19:44,372 --> 03:19:46,007
FLORIDA, BUT ANDREW GILLUM WILL 

6078
03:19:46,007 --> 03:19:46,474
WIN THROUGHOUT. 

6079
03:19:46,474 --> 03:19:48,076
I THINK ONE OF THE DECIDING 

6080
03:19:48,076 --> 03:19:48,776
FACTORS IN THIS RACE. 

6081
03:19:48,776 --> 03:19:50,478
I MENTIONED THIS IN ONE OF MY 

6082
03:19:50,478 --> 03:19:52,280
EARLIER VISITS WITH YOU GUYS. 

6083
03:19:52,280 --> 03:19:54,382
THE LAST TWO GOVERNORS RACES 

6084
03:19:54,382 --> 03:19:56,951
OUT OF THE 6 MILLION CAST FOUR 

6085
03:19:56,951 --> 03:19:59,787
YEARS AGO, 62,000 VOTES 

6086
03:19:59,787 --> 03:20:00,354
SEPARATED FOUR CANDIDATES. 

6087
03:20:00,354 --> 03:20:01,689
EIGHT YEARS AGO 5.5 MILLION 

6088
03:20:01,689 --> 03:20:04,192
VOTES CAST, AGAIN 60,000 VOTES 

6089
03:20:04,192 --> 03:20:04,492
SEPARATED. 

6090
03:20:04,492 --> 03:20:06,126
HOW DO YOU GET TO THAT CENTRAL 

6091
03:20:06,126 --> 03:20:06,360
GROUND. 

6092
03:20:06,360 --> 03:20:08,096
I THINK ONE OF THE KEYS OF THIS 

6093
03:20:08,096 --> 03:20:10,298
RACE WILL BE THE STONEMAN 

6094
03:20:10,298 --> 03:20:11,399
DOUGLAS SHOOTING AND GUNS. 

6095
03:20:11,399 --> 03:20:13,167
I THINK THERE'S A CALCULATION 

6096
03:20:13,167 --> 03:20:19,073
BEING MADE NOW THAT THE WAY TO 

6097
03:20:19,073 --> 03:20:20,575
ATTRACT THE WOMEN VOTERS, 

6098
03:20:20,575 --> 03:20:21,242
COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN 

6099
03:20:21,242 --> 03:20:23,444
WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP IN 

6100
03:20:23,444 --> 03:20:25,246
2016, ARE THEY TURNED OFF NOW 

6101
03:20:25,246 --> 03:20:26,881
TO THE GUN VIOLENCE, THE MASS 

6102
03:20:26,881 --> 03:20:28,049
SHOOTINGS, TURNED OFF BY SOME 

6103
03:20:28,049 --> 03:20:29,784
OF WHAT THEY HEAR FROM DONALD 

6104
03:20:29,784 --> 03:20:32,086
TRUMP AND WILL THEY VOTE FOR A 

6105
03:20:32,086 --> 03:20:33,554
CANDIDATE LIKE ANDREW GILLUM? 

6106
03:20:33,554 --> 03:20:34,154
THAT'S THE QUESTION DEMOCRATS 

6107
03:20:34,154 --> 03:20:35,690
WILL TRY TO ANSWER AND 

6108
03:20:35,690 --> 03:20:37,625
REPUBLICANS WILL TRY TO RUN A 

6109
03:20:37,625 --> 03:20:39,527
REAL BASE ELECTION AND APPEAL 

6110
03:20:39,527 --> 03:20:40,027
TO OTHER ISSUES. 

6111
03:20:40,027 --> 03:20:42,663
>> JIM, IF YOU'LL STAND BY, FOR 

6112
03:20:42,663 --> 03:20:45,166
OUR VIEWERS WHO ARE MAYBE JUST 

6113
03:20:45,166 --> 03:20:46,701
STARTING TO TUNE INTO THE 

6114
03:20:46,701 --> 03:20:48,603
FLORIDA CONTEST, WE HEARD FROM 

6115
03:20:48,603 --> 03:20:49,971
CONGRESSMAN RON DESANTIS WHO 

6116
03:20:49,971 --> 03:20:51,472
WON THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR 

6117
03:20:51,472 --> 03:20:51,939
GOVERNOR IN FLORIDA. 

6118
03:20:51,939 --> 03:20:53,975
HERE'S A BIT OF WHAT HE HAD TO 

6119
03:20:53,975 --> 03:20:54,175
SAY. 

6120
03:20:54,175 --> 03:20:55,977
>> I'M NOT ALWAYS THE MOST 

6121
03:20:55,977 --> 03:20:58,312
POPULAR GUY IN D.C., BUT I DID 

6122
03:20:58,312 --> 03:20:59,780
HAVE SUPPORT FROM SOMEONE IN 

6123
03:20:59,780 --> 03:21:00,281
WASHINGTON. 

6124
03:21:00,281 --> 03:21:01,382
IF YOU WALK DOWN PENNSYLVANIA 

6125
03:21:01,382 --> 03:21:02,784
AVENUE, HE LIVES IN THE WHITE 

6126
03:21:02,784 --> 03:21:04,552
HOUSE WITH THE PILLARS IN FRONT 

6127
03:21:04,552 --> 03:21:04,886
OF IT. 

6128
03:21:04,886 --> 03:21:07,388
I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE 

6129
03:21:07,388 --> 03:21:07,688
PRESIDENT. 

6130
03:21:07,688 --> 03:21:09,290
I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS 

6131
03:21:09,290 --> 03:21:09,457
SUPPORT. 

6132
03:21:11,258 --> 03:21:12,894
I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR VIEWING 

6133
03:21:12,894 --> 03:21:14,762
ME AS SOMEBODY WHO COULD BE A 

6134
03:21:14,762 --> 03:21:16,397
GREAT LEADER FOR FLORIDA. 

6135
03:21:16,397 --> 03:21:20,701
SO THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

6136
03:21:20,701 --> 03:21:21,068
>> ALL RIGHT. 

6137
03:21:21,068 --> 03:21:23,204
SO, JIM, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 

6138
03:21:23,204 --> 03:21:24,906
OUTLINES OF THIS RACE NOW, 

6139
03:21:24,906 --> 03:21:29,177
YOU'VE COVERED FLORIDA POLITICS 

6140
03:21:29,177 --> 03:21:30,778
FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHAT IS 

6141
03:21:30,778 --> 03:21:32,380
THE DYNAMIC IN THE STATE RIGHT 

6142
03:21:32,380 --> 03:21:34,182
NOW WITH RESPECT TO THE 

6143
03:21:34,182 --> 03:21:35,816
ELECTORATE THAT WILL HELP 

6144
03:21:35,816 --> 03:21:37,284
DECIDE WHO EMERGES VICTORIOUS 

6145
03:21:37,284 --> 03:21:37,651
IN NOVEMBER? 

6146
03:21:37,651 --> 03:21:39,787
>> THE ISSUES I THINK RESONATE 

6147
03:21:39,787 --> 03:21:41,989
THE MOST WITH VOTERS NOW, I DO 

6148
03:21:41,989 --> 03:21:42,923
THINK GUNS AND SAFETY. 

6149
03:21:42,923 --> 03:21:45,626
WE HAD ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING IN 

6150
03:21:45,626 --> 03:21:46,327
JACKSONVILLE. 

6151
03:21:46,327 --> 03:21:47,995
YOU HAD THE STONEMAN DOUGLAS 

6152
03:21:47,995 --> 03:21:49,030
SHOOTING ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS 

6153
03:21:49,030 --> 03:21:49,263
AGO. 

6154
03:21:49,263 --> 03:21:52,233
YOU HAD THE PULSE SHOOTING. 

6155
03:21:52,233 --> 03:21:53,000
THOSE SHOOTINGS ARE RESONATING 

6156
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:53,634
THROUGHOUT THE STATE. 

6157
03:21:53,634 --> 03:21:55,803
I THINK THE ENVIRONMENT IS 

6158
03:21:55,803 --> 03:21:56,937
ANOTHER CRITICAL ISSUE. 

6159
03:21:56,937 --> 03:21:59,440
YOU HAVE THE TOXIC GREEN ALGAE 

6160
03:21:59,440 --> 03:22:00,508
SLUDGE COMING OUT OF LAKE 

6161
03:22:00,508 --> 03:22:02,076
OKEECHOBEE THAT IS DECIMATING 

6162
03:22:02,076 --> 03:22:03,478
BOTH THE EAST AND WEST COASTS 

6163
03:22:03,478 --> 03:22:03,778
OF FLORIDA. 

6164
03:22:03,778 --> 03:22:05,179
THAT IS A HUGE PROBLEM THAT 

6165
03:22:05,179 --> 03:22:06,681
BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS 

6166
03:22:06,681 --> 03:22:09,083
ARE POINTING THE FINGER AT EACH 

6167
03:22:09,083 --> 03:22:09,350
OTHER ON. 

6168
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:11,586
I WOULD SAY THE THIRD ISSUE IS 

6169
03:22:11,586 --> 03:22:12,620
HEALTHCARE. 

6170
03:22:12,620 --> 03:22:13,888
THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF 

6171
03:22:13,888 --> 03:22:14,522
FLORIDIANS WITHOUT HEALTHCARE 

6172
03:22:14,522 --> 03:22:16,824
AND THE STATE IS NO CLOSER TO 

6173
03:22:16,824 --> 03:22:19,327
SOLVING THAT ISSUE THAN FOUR OR 

6174
03:22:19,327 --> 03:22:19,894
EIGHT YEARS AGO. 

6175
03:22:19,894 --> 03:22:22,496
RON DESANTIS VOTED TO ELIMINATE 

6176
03:22:22,496 --> 03:22:22,830
OBAMACARE. 

6177
03:22:22,830 --> 03:22:24,332
ANDREW GILLUM WANTS MEDICARE 

6178
03:22:24,332 --> 03:22:24,599
FOR ALL. 

6179
03:22:24,599 --> 03:22:26,634
SO YOU'VE GOT VERY STARK 

6180
03:22:26,634 --> 03:22:26,934
CONTRASTS. 

6181
03:22:26,934 --> 03:22:29,370
>> JIM, WHAT IS THE THING 

6182
03:22:29,370 --> 03:22:31,772
YOU'LL WATCH MOST CLOSELY IN 

6183
03:22:31,772 --> 03:22:33,774
THIS PARTICULAR MATCH-UP 

6184
03:22:33,774 --> 03:22:34,709
BETWEEN RON DESANTIS AND ANDREW 

6185
03:22:34,709 --> 03:22:34,942
GILLUM? 

6186
03:22:34,942 --> 03:22:36,410
>> I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT 

6187
03:22:36,410 --> 03:22:37,244
WHERE THE MONEY COMES IN. 

6188
03:22:37,244 --> 03:22:38,980
WHETHER OR NOT THE DEMOCRATS 

6189
03:22:38,980 --> 03:22:40,882
WILL FIGHT HARD FOR THIS AND 

6190
03:22:40,882 --> 03:22:42,783
THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THE 

6191
03:22:42,783 --> 03:22:43,817
DEMOCRATS WILL PUMP MONEY. 

6192
03:22:43,817 --> 03:22:46,420
IN LOOK, RON DESANTIS WILL BE 

6193
03:22:46,420 --> 03:22:48,388
ABLE TO RAISE -- MONEY IN. 

6194
03:22:48,388 --> 03:22:53,628
LOOK, RON DESAN  -- DESANTIS 

6195
03:22:53,628 --> 03:22:56,364
WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE A LOT OF 

6196
03:22:56,364 --> 03:22:56,597
MONEY. 

6197
03:22:56,597 --> 03:22:57,398
THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH. 

6198
03:22:57,398 --> 03:22:58,633
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK 

6199
03:22:58,633 --> 03:22:59,933
PEOPLE LOSE TRACK OF IN TERMS 

6200
03:22:59,933 --> 03:23:02,270
OF WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT GOING 

6201
03:23:02,270 --> 03:23:03,471
FORWARD IN THE GOVERNORS RACE 

6202
03:23:03,471 --> 03:23:04,071
IS REDISTRICTING WILL TAKE 

6203
03:23:04,071 --> 03:23:06,707
PLACE IN 2020 AFTER THE CENSUS. 

6204
03:23:06,707 --> 03:23:08,409
WHOEVER IS ELECTED GOVERNOR NOW 

6205
03:23:08,409 --> 03:23:09,477
WILL OVERSEE THE REDISTRICTING 

6206
03:23:09,477 --> 03:23:12,513
OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA FOR 

6207
03:23:12,513 --> 03:23:12,980
CONGRESSIONAL RACES. 

6208
03:23:12,980 --> 03:23:13,514
THAT COULD BE CRITICAL. 

6209
03:23:13,514 --> 03:23:16,384
THE LEGISLATURE WILL DIVIDE IT 

6210
03:23:16,384 --> 03:23:16,784
UP. 

6211
03:23:16,784 --> 03:23:18,986
IT'S STILL GOING TO BE A 

6212
03:23:18,986 --> 03:23:19,686
REPUBLICAN LED LEGISLATURE, BUT 

6213
03:23:19,686 --> 03:23:22,189
IF THERE'S A DEMOCRAT IN THE 

6214
03:23:22,189 --> 03:23:23,424
GOVERNOR'S MANSION, THEY CAN 

6215
03:23:23,424 --> 03:23:24,892
THREATEN TO VETO THOSE BILLS 

6216
03:23:24,892 --> 03:23:26,827
AND IT COULD BE A VERY 

6217
03:23:26,827 --> 03:23:27,928
DIFFERENT THING IN TERMS OF 

6218
03:23:27,928 --> 03:23:28,295
REDISTRICTING. 

6219
03:23:28,295 --> 03:23:30,131
I'M GOING TO LOOK TO SEE WHERE 

6220
03:23:30,131 --> 03:23:33,834
THE MONEY IS COMING INTO THIS 

6221
03:23:33,834 --> 03:23:34,034
RACE. 

6222
03:23:34,034 --> 03:23:35,036
>> JIM, THANKS SO MUCH. 

6223
03:23:35,036 --> 03:23:36,003
WE'LL HAVE MORE PRIMARY 

6224
03:23:36,003 --> 03:23:37,605
COVERAGE IN A MOMENT, BUT FIRST 

6225
03:23:37,605 --> 03:23:38,172
A QUICK BREAK. 

6226
03:23:38,172 --> 03:23:40,508
STAY WITH US. 

6227
03:23:40,508 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.
