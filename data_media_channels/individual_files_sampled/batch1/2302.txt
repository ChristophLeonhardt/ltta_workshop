the time excuse kind of drives me nuts the classic response to this is hey Mark Zuckerberg has time to do it but you're not Mark Zuckerberg what I can tell you is that when you break it down and think about time let me first say that time is the most politically correct excuse that we use I don't have time what is your friend gonna say actually Ramin you do have time you watch four episodes of Vanderpump rules every Tuesday morning you do this you go out to 25 restaurants dah dah dah dah dah you watch the Netflix no because it's very politically incorrect to say actually you're lying to me into yourself so we say it because we know we can get away with it a couple of thoughts on time management number one we have a lot of students who have successfully started businesses and I'm talking $10,000 a hundred thousand dollars seven figures on five hours a week to start that's it starting a business finding the time is about knowing what you should focus on and also knowing what you don't need to focus on so we get a lot of people like I got to be on Pinterest Twitter Instagram snapchat a million different things no you don't what you need to do is find out you have a profitable idea and you need to sell something and generate your first revenue okay that's number one number two really think about where you are spending your time what I do is I put it in my calendar so I have writing time every week I need to write otherwise if I don't put it on my calendar it just gets away from me so I block it off and it becomes a non-negotiable I guarantee you right now if you said hey I don't need 50 hours to start a business every week I just need five block it off on your calendar maybe it's Monday morning maybe it's Wednesday night and it's Saturday for three hours all of a sudden your calendar is gonna flow around those blocks instead of you flowing around whatever life throws at you
