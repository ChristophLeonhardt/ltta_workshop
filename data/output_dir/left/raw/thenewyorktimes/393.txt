1
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:29,546
Beloit is an old Rust Belt 
manufacturing community

2
00:00:29,546 --> 00:00:33,496
that just did some spectacular 
things for many, many years.

3
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,969
But the transition, like
many other Rust Belt communities,

4
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,329
started as technology — started 
to change and manufacturing

5
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:52,969
started going overseas.
Ultimately we looked at Ironworks

6
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:59,449
here as a great kind of a canvas 
to take a very, very old building and

7
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:03,449
transform into something that 
could be used in today’s world

8
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,419
with most notably technology.

9
00:01:29,874 --> 00:01:32,894
The evolution didn’t just happen 
overnight, and it’s kind of like,

10
00:01:32,894 --> 00:01:36,134
which comes first, the chicken 
or the egg, and we’re trying

11
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:38,104
to figure out how we could 
reinvent this.

12
00:01:38,104 --> 00:01:39,964
Because again, what comes first, 
do you get the businesses

13
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:44,034
and then hope the people come, 
do you try with your existing

14
00:01:44,034 --> 00:00:00,000
businesses to get more 
excitement somehow?
