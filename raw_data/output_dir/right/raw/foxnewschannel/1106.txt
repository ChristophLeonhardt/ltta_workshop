PHONEY HE WAS.

76
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:08,847
HE HID THIS INVESTIGATION FROM

77
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:09,914
CONGRESS FOR 8 MONTHS.

78
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:11,616
JUST SO EVERYBODY IS CLEAR ON

79
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:16,988

80
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,891
QUARTERLY BRIEFINGS TO CONGRESS

81
00:03:19,891 --> 00:03:21,826
ABOUT SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS.

82
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,728
THEY ASKED HIM, EVERY 3 MONTHS,

83
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:24,729
THIS IS NOT DIFFICULT FOR

84
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:25,563
ANYBODY TO UNDERSTAND.

85
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:30,135
HE HIDES IT FOR 8 MONTHS.

86
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:32,504
MR. COMEY, WHY DID YOU HIDE THE

87
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,605
INVESTIGATION FROM CONGRESS FOR

88
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,106
8 MONTHS?

89
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:37,142
YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE THIS.

90
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:38,710
BECAUSE IT WAS SENSITIVE.

91
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,079
AFTER ACKNOWLEDGING THEY BRIEFED

92
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,747
CONGRESS EVERY 3 MONTHS BECAUSE

93
00:03:42,747 --> 00:03:44,849
OF SENSITIVE INVESTIGATIONS.

94
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,151
I AM TALKING ABOUT THE

00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:48,319
INVESTIGATION OF DONALD TRUMP.

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,622
COMEY IS BEING EXPOSED.

97
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:51,990
HORRIBLE LEADERSHIP.

98
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,660
I HOPE THIS IG REPORT GETS THE

99
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,561
TRUTH OUT THERE.

100

MONEY AND WORK REALLY HARD AND

105
00:04:06,237 --> 00:04:10,341
PUT THEIR LIVES IN DANGER EVERY

106
00:04:10,341 --> 00:04:10,608

107
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:12,510
WHAT DO THEY THINK?

108
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,679
I TRY TO PUT MYSELF IN THEIR

109
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:14,979
SHOES.

110
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,748
WHAT ARE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY

00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:19,884
SEE THE CIRCUS AROUND THIS

112
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,287
HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL

113
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:24,322
INVESTIGATION AND THE COLLUSION

114
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:27,759
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND TRUMP THAT

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,260
SEEMS NONEXISTENT.

116
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,196
DATES NOT MATCHING UP.

117
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,697
WHAT IS GOING THROUGH THEIR

118
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:32,997
MINDS?

119
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:37,102
>> YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE

120
00:04:37,102 --> 00:04:38,036
DISAPPOINTED.

121
00:04:38,036 --> 00:04:40,638
COMEY, I DON'T BELIEVE HE EVER

122
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:43,208
WAS AN FBI AGENT.

123
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,375
HE WAS AN ATTORNEY.

124
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,812
HE HASN'T COME UP THROUGH THE

125
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:48,646
RANKS.

126
00:04:48,646 --> 00:04:50,548
CONTRAST TO AT THE CIA HASKELL

127
00:04:50,548 --> 00:04:53,885
WHO CAME UP THROUGH THE RANKS.

128
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:58,423
ONE OF THE UNDER LYING THINGS IS

129
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,126
WHERE ARE THE WHISTLE BLOWERS

130
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:01,426
HERE?

131
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,696
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THERE ARE

132
00:05:04,696 --> 00:05:06,931
NOT RANK-AND-FILE WHISTLE

133
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:07,932
PLOWERS COMING FORWARD.

134
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:10,235
THERE IS A PAY SYSTEM IN THE

135
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:10,668
FBI.

136
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:13,938
THEY DON'T GET THE BEST BASE

137
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,205
PAY.

138
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:18,143
A SYSTEM REWARDS THEM WITH 25%

139
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:22,013
OF THEIR BASE PAY.

140
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:24,883
IT CAME LAW ENFORCEMENT

141
00:05:24,883 --> 00:05:26,751
AVAILABILITY PAY.

142
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:30,688
THE FBI AGENTS HAVE TO CERTIFY

143
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:32,323
THAT ADDITIONAL TIME HAS BEEN

144
00:05:32,323 --> 00:05:32,657
WORKED.

145
00:05:32,657 --> 00:05:36,394
50 HOUR WEEKS OR MORE.

146
00:05:36,394 --> 00:05:38,563
SOMETIMES THESE CORNERS ARE CUT.

147
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:41,533
A GREAT LOOK OUT THERE CALLED

148
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,670

FRAUD AND THE SUPERVISORS

151

CERTIFY THIS TIME WAS WORKED.

152
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,481
>> Laura: YOU ARE SAYING THEY

153
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,049
ARE NOT WHISTLE BLOWERS BECAUSE

154
00:05:58,049 --> 00:05:59,951
THEY ARE AFRAID THEY WILL GET

155
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,186
DOCKED PAY?

156
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:06,524
>> WELL, THEY HAD TO SIGN EXTRA

157
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:08,493
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS.

158
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,896
THEY PUT THE FEAR OF GOD INTO

159
00:06:11,896 --> 00:06:14,532
THEM FORCING THEM TO SIGN THESE

160
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:14,933
AGREEMENTS.

161
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:18,870
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT

162
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:28,613
THE IG LEAK IS UNDERMINES THE

163
00:06:28,613 --> 00:06:30,815
COMEY INVESTIGATION.

164
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:32,717
>> Laura: HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

165
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:34,419
GONE DAY 1.

166
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:35,687
THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW THINGS

167
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,288
TRUMP COULD HAVE DONE

168
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:37,689
DIFFERENTLY.

169
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,824
>> THIS WAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

170
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:42,627
ANTI-CORRUPTION ACT BY A

171
00:06:42,627 --> 00:06:46,464
PRESIDENT IN RECENT MEMORY.

172
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:49,334
[OVERLAPPING TALKING].

173
00:06:49,334 --> 00:06:52,403
>> Laura: DAN, WHY IS ROB

174
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:53,171
ROSENSTEIN STILL SUPERVISING

175
00:06:53,171 --> 00:06:55,707
MUELLER WHEN HE IS GOING TO BE A

176
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,741
WITNESS?

177
00:06:56,741 --> 00:06:58,643
HE IS A WITNESS HAVING SIGNED A

178
00:06:58,643 --> 00:07:02,413
FISA WARRANT THAT DID NOT REVEAL

179
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:05,350
THAT HILLARY CLINTON PAID FOR

180
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,151
THAT FIELD DOSSIER.

181
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:08,152
LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS ALL OVER THIS

182
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:10,088
AND SAID I WILL RECUSE MYSELF.

183
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:12,190
HE SHOULD NOT BE EXERCISING

184
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,523
MUELLER.

185
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:16,327
>> LAURA, NOT ONLY THAT.

186
00:07:16,327 --> 00:07:18,830
NOT ONLY DID ROSENSTEIN SIGN A

187
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,665
FISA WARRANT.

188
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,767
HE IS A MATERIAL WITNESS IN THE

189
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:26,204
FIRING OF JIM COMEY WHICH THE

190
00:07:26,204 --> 00:07:29,374
DEMOCRATS ALLEGE WAS THE

191
00:07:29,374 --> 00:07:34,579
GREATEST SIN OF THE TRUMP

PRESIDENCY.

196
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,166
THE GREAT MYSTERIES.

00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:02,607
THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AND IN

200
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,841
THE WHITE HOUSE.

201
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:05,877
THE UNDER-SECRETARY POSITIONS

202
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:08,313
ARE SO IMPORTANT.

203
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:12,116
YOU HAVE BAD PEOPLE YOU FOR BIG

204
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,785
TROUBLE.

205
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,087
JEFF, REACT TO PAUL RYAN TODAY

00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:21,993
IN HIS WEEKLY PRESS CONFERENCE

207
00:08:21,993 --> 00:08:30,935
JUMPED ON THE GAUDY SPY WAGON.

208
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,003
LET'S WATCH.

209
00:08:32,003 --> 00:08:35,039

210
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,841

00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:42,746
>> I DON'T LIKE TO COMMENT, LET

212
00:08:42,746 --> 00:08:46,284
ME SAY IT THIS WAY.

213
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:48,553
I THINK HIS INITIAL ASSESSMENTS

214
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:54,625
ARE ACCURATE BUT HAVE MORE

215
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,127
DIGING TO DO.

216
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,395
>> Laura: THAT'S AN

217
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:57,862
UNDERSTATEMENT.

218
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,497
A LOT OF DOCUMENTS ARE MISSING.

219
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,198
NO SPY.

220
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:02,266
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THAT?

221
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:07,205
>> WELL, MY REACTION IS THIS HAS

222
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:10,508
ALWAYS BEEN 2 DIFFERENT

223
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:10,875
APROACHES.

224
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,712
WHEN THE DEMOCRATS APPARATUS WAS

225
00:09:14,712 --> 00:09:15,980
PENETRATED BY PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF

226
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:19,550
THIS COUNTRY THE FBI WARNED THEM

227
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:19,951
TOGETHER.

228
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,452
THAT'S NOT THE WAY THEY HANDLED

229
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,521
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE COIN.

230
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,524
THEY DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND

231
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,726
CALL IT ENTRAPMENT.

232
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:30,228
THEY DIDN'T GO INTO THEM AS

233
00:09:30,228 --> 00:09:32,196
AMERICAN CITIZENS AND SAY,

234
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,432
LISTEN, WE HAVE FOREIGN ENTITS

235
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:36,267
TRYING TO PENETRATE THIS AND

236
00:09:36,267 --> 00:09:38,669
CORRUPT THE PROCESS.

237
00:09:38,669 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY HANDLED THE REPUBLICANS
