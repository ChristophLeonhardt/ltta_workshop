it's been revealed that US authorities have been secretly tracking American travelers under a surveillance program called quiet skies the move targets people who haven't been investigated by any US agency but still may pose a risk this is suspicious behavior defined as things like stronger body odor irregular sleeping patterns and changing hairstyle or clothes could flag up someone for surveillance the unit then compiles individual daily reports after the story broke the TSA issued a statement claiming it's standard procedure federal air marshals may deploy on flights in furtherance of the TSA mission to ensure the safety and security of passengers crew members and aircraft throughout the aviation sector my colleague Kay Partridge got reaction to this from investigative reporter Dave Linder and political commentator Steve malls Berg TSA has determined that yes surely the shoe bomber Steve travel patterns and may be changing and maybe changing hair color which could be suspicious and it's not only hair color and body odor those are - to promote examples but you know what let's take a poll the American people and overwhelmingly they'll say do what it takes to keep us safe hey do you want people to be able to say Bob while walking through an airport - because they can't they'll get arrested they didn't catch a bunch of people with their no-fly lists they were busy capturing nuns who were going to protests and people like my co-author of the impeachment book Barbara Lansky who was stopped and every time she she had to make sure she had good Underpants because she was strip-searched every time she would fly because she was a lawyer for the Center for Constitutional Rights people have to understand is that you don't have any right to fly in the United States certainly it's a privilege to fly and you don't have a right to say whatever you want on a plane or in an airport you don't have a right to move about the way you want so your freedoms are severely limited to begin with for security purposes and I believe most Americans would agree rightfully so these things get out of hand if people don't get to know that they're on a list and get to challenge the list and that was the problem with the no-fly list that's the problem with this that nobody knows they're on hand maybe we know maybe they're watching you maybe there was probably him if I now know there were air marshals who are armed on my flights most of my flights I don't care who they're watching as long as they're there so I don't have a problem with this what some of these human rights groups are saying they're saying the TSA may be singling people out though if you think about according to race or some of those other factors we might be you might be keeping people safe but is it okay so they're focusing on the right people yeah of course that's what I was talking about when they went after the nuns and the political people they weren't going after the people that were the real problems and risks and look I got a I got a beard I look like maybe I'm you know some jihadi that list goes to law enforcement in the United States it's gonna stay there and it's going to impact your life in some way because you're not going to know it's there and they're gonna watch you in different ways it may affect your employment your promotion could affect all kinds of things you should have a right to know once they decide that you're not a suspicious person supposedly after 90 days that you're on that list and it gets wiped there's nobody saying that happens this is out of control problem already and it's going to get worse to say it's out of control to say that we've missed to say that we've missed people will be crazy because we're watching this one we missed that one there are none they point to the shoe bomber that was a long time ago to say people aren't going to get promotions people are going to get not get jobs there's no evidence of this this is math sister this is not math it's just evidence when everything to fly is privileged if you don't want to if every kind I want a bit realist on fly don't fly you
