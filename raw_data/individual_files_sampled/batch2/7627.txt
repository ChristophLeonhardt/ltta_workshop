North in South Korea have engaged in diplomatic talks following some threats of potential nuclear war due to trump and his provocative tweets now the Olympics are set to take place in South Korea and interestingly enough North Korea will have a role in the Olympics and I'll give you the details on what they've agreed to so far the two Koreas will actually compete in a unified team in the Olympics for the first time though they have joined forces at other international sports before now they haven't really decided which sport they will join in on you know as one unified team there's some speculation that it could be the hockey team and South Korea's hockey team is not amused by that and I'll tell you what they think in just a minute North Korea will also send a delegation of more than 400 including 230 cheerleaders 140 artists and 30 Taekwondo fighters for a demonstration now here's what South Korean athletes have to say about all of this our players are really nervous we can only take 23 players to the Olympics this is someone who represents the South Korea women's hockey team and they thought the North Koreans are going to come in and take our spots so there's a little bit of pushback but understand that a lot of this really has to do with easing tensions among both countries and also trying to possibly enter negotiations regarding nuclear disarmament I don't know how likely that is to happen but there is historical precedent when it comes to this very issue involving South Korea and the United States back in 1987 about a year before the Olympics were set to take place in Seoul there was a pretty terrible act of violence on the part of North Koreans to North Korean agents bombed a flight that mostly had South Korean workers on it and you would think after that I mean relations are done no one's interested in having any diplomatic talks but Ronald Reagan surprisingly approached North Korea and look I know you guys want to you know open up negotiations have some diplomatic talks you want to maybe possibly have some role in the Olympics in Seoul why don't we have those discussions as long as you promise that you will not carry out an act of terror during the 1988 Olympics so in the past their acts of violence have been met with diplomatic talks and so the only bargaining chip that they've always really had was bad behavior well Reagan encouraged a lot of terrorists he negotiated with terrorists all the time even he sold them weapons go look it up so okay but putting that aside I generally really like this I I get the concern of that those very specific people the female ice hockey team yeah the North Koreans might take some of their spots if they were gonna be on 23 persons team and they could only have 23 people and half of them are now North Koreans well there goes you know 11 or 12 people off that team potentially maybe right so the second thing that that's the concern is apparently they were a pretty good team North Koreans are not nearly as good an ice hockey so there goes our chance of meddling probably but you never know I've seen miracles on ice before but come on the issue of peace is so much larger than one hockey team so I love the idea of bringing them together and I know it's a small step and you know the right-wingers always scream i B's man right but you don't have to appease North Korea you don't have to ease the sanctions you don't have to say hey you know what guys everybody take a load off don't worry about North Korea and their bombs know you could be as vigilant as you were the day before but to me the most important part is they're gonna fly they're gonna appear under one flag that's a big step and these steps matter the closer you get to peace the better off you are the further away you are from peace or the worse off the whole world is so I I welcome this completely yeah look I ultimately agree with you but I definitely understand the other perspective right which is you know they have been carrying out missile tests and and nuclear tests and all of that stuff that's been incredibly provocative and all stuff and and you know to be met with kindness it's it goes against what human instincts are but I think that when it comes to international relations you have to overcome whatever human instincts you have because human instincts will lead to terrible outcomes you have to tuck tail and and and do what's right in the name of peace but at the same time like I don't know how this all ends okay so the Olympics happen and then what they're not willing to stop their missile tests they're not willing to stop with their provocative language about destroying the United States you know you know destroying potentially South Korea although those conversations have subsided a little bit I mean there needs to be a long-term solution I'm not sure what that solution is so let me say the last two things about that one is yeah you don't get to make peace with your allies you already at peace with them you make peace with your enemies that's why it's really really hard so when Jimmy Carter did one of the greatest things the US president has ever done he brought peace to the Middle East between Egypt and Israel Egypt was the the top enemy of Israel at the time and the strongest one and what do you do he put their two leaders at Camp David together and they didn't want to be there they tried to take helicopter rides out of there over and over again and it was really difficult and Bagan and cidade didn't like each other their countries didn't like each other that's why they were at war and they didn't want to do the deal and in the deal they gave up things they didn't want to give up and it was super hard but the first step was an important step maybe the most important step he brought them to Camp David they began to talk and that's how things go so here we are taking a first step and in the second point I want to make is what's the alternative we say no we're not gonna let you into the Olympics with South Korea we're not gonna let you under the ice hockey team well you made the situation even more hostile driving them to even more provocative talking more missile tests that's what I mean when I say that you know their bad behavior happens to be like the one bargaining chip that they have and it sucks that it's working out that way but again ultimately I agree with you I mean this is the best way to handle it especially considering the fact that you know you don't want any type of threat during the Winter Olympics and if North Korea is playing a role there isn't going to be a and look it's a and I'm less concerned about that as I am although I'm very concerned about it as overall peace in the region and so look I I don't want anyone to think that anyone should be naive about the North Koreans like Oh Kim jong-un says he'll play hockey with you then I'm sure they're fine no they still have concentration camps in North Korea they're still you know treating their population in the most grotesque ways possible let alone threatening South Korea Japan and Japan is very skeptical and very rightfully so remain skeptical okay but at the same time take that first step towards peace if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm /join and once you do you'll be saying you know
