the murderous perpetrator of last week's London terror attack has now been identified in the press as a man born in England the BBC ABC Reuters and The New York Times a former newspaper all headlined the fact that the terrorist was a native of the UK the Kent born UK native Englishman is named kalid Masood an old anglo-saxon name meaning Allah will destroy every unbeliever which is what they used to say back in anglo-saxon times the savage act of violence by this british-born British man from Britain raises some questions are the British naturally violent and what was it in particular that moved this English Englishman from England to commit such a brutal act on his fellow English Englishman was it something in the fish and chips that set off a bizarre chemical reaction and mr. Masood's brain and caused him to turn away from watching football on the telly in order to murder his fellow Westerners in the name of Allah was he just sick and tired of wearing a derby and carrying an umbrella all the time or saying silly sounding British things like what oh or dash at all or Allahu Akbar or was he inspired to violence by some particularly triggering episode of Downton Abbey or the latest BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice in fact we may never know this uk-born British Englishman's peculiarly Anglican motive for this British act of English savagery now I don't want to stir up any anti-english feeling here for all the violence committed by uk-born British Englishman like mr. masood I'm sure there are practically dozens of peaceful hard wit working English men and women who simply want to raise their families and do their jobs and attend their houses of worship to pray to the God of love or possibly the hate-filled warrior God who commands us to destroy everyone who doesn't believe in him I always get those two gods confused I think it would be a shame if this isolated act of terrorism by a lone wolf english-born Englishman should cause an uptick in incidents of Anglo fabia or cause anyone to view a UK born Britain with suspicion when he's simply sitting harmlessly in the local pub enjoying a pint and reading the Koran while strapped with dynamite now you may say well if we can't examine what turned so many Englishmen into terrorists how will we ever stop them from committing their English acts of terror shouldn't we be asking what is it about reading Shakespeare Milton Charles Dickens and Harry Potter that has created that peculiarly English outlook on life that leads to poverty oppression brutality and terror everywhere it arises if we just turn a blind eye to English terror won't we all altima tlie be conquered by England and forced to live under Magna Carta while speaking and funny sort of gay sounding accents yeah but I say let's try and coexist let's reach out to our English neighbors in friendship and understanding just steer clear of the Islamist ones because those guys will kill you trigger warning I'm Andrew Klavan

nice nice sponsor I like this much alright alright so here's what i wrote on friday when the health care bill fails writing at pj media where I have my Clavin on the culture column I fear that conservatives may have erred the president has never shown himself to be a reliable philosophical conservative he often seems guided to go where he is loved and worked with those who are nice to him he clearly is committed to the concept of winning if the president now finds himself humiliated by the conservative leadership unable to work with Republicans on the hill many conservatives may find they have paved the way toward and essentially left-wing presidency I feel this may be the end result of the failure of the health care bill a Washington in which Donald Trump can find more love on the left and on the right more chance of winning through leftism then through conservatism that was Friday here's the Wall Street Journal headline today White House opens door to Democrats in wake of health bill failure move signals Trump administration is fed up with many factions in House Republican Conference and Trump is also tweeting against the freedom caucus but conservatives who basically shot down the bill so I know what you're saying how does Cleveland do that the physics it was like a property like you know he's like that kid in in the sixth sense who sees dead people except he just looks into the future and sees things that aren't going to happen so reason the reason is is that I'm just a practical realist night my attitude is different my attitude is admittedly different to those who want to live and die on the hill of principle and the hill of righteousness I love my country I want to do the best thing for my country at any given moment that's what love looks like me sometimes love tastes like a crap sandwich okay you could have make a little mug that says that sometimes love tastes like a crab salmon I didn't love voting for Donald Trump I did not love voting for Donald Trump there were exactly two choices one was Hillary Clinton who I thought actually was wicked and would mark the end of the American experiment one was Donald Trump who is an unreliable if you're a conservative right some people aren't conservative and like Trump they their populace they want to they want to keep all the entitlements and all that stuff great then he's a perfect candidate for me the guy is to the left of me and he's not a reliable conservative lifelong Democrat so how do you then deal with it for a moment there for a moment because Trump goes where he's loved because all this love was coming from the conservative side for a moment we had a chance to get that agenda going and it still but if chance is not totally destroyed but I think on this first big thing the first big thing that he was his legislative accomplishment you don't just give him everything he wants all day long for the rest of his term but on the first big thing I would have given him a win I would not have stood on my righteousness I would have given him the win and hope the Senate made it into a better bill it wasn't a great bill it was not a great bill everybody knew it wasn't but look so let's take a look here's Trump right in the aftermath and he puts it on the Democrats that were stuck with Obamacare which is what he's going to sell yeah we were very close he's very very tight margin we have no Democrats support we had no votes from the Democrats and if they weren't going to give us a single vote so it's a very difficult thing to do I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode it is exploding right now it's many states have big problems almost all states have big problems I was in Tennessee the other day and they've lost half of their state in terms of an insurer have no insurance and that's happening to many other places i was in Kentucky the other day and similar things are happening so Obamacare is exploding with no democrat support we couldn't quite get there were just a very small number of those shorts in terms of getting our bill had a lot of people don't realize how good our bill was because they were viewing phase one but when you add phase two which was mostly designing for secretary price who's behind them and you add phase three which I think we would have gotten it became the great film see I agree that he would have gotten phase two because obviously that was stuff that just need to depend on a phone and not even a phone actually but I don't think they would have ever gotten to stage three now so first he slaps the Democrats around I first he says you know you stuck us with this bill all your fault we wouldn't help us change it and then he reaches out the room here's the second code again I think what will happen is Obamacare unfortunately will explode could have a very bad year last year you had over a hundred percent increases in various places in Arizona understand it going up very rapidly again like it did last year lesser was 116 / said many places fifty sixty seventy percent i guess it averaged whatever the average was very very hard and this year should be much worse for Obamacare so what would be really good with no democrat support if the democrats when it explodes which it will soon if they got together with us and get a real health care so i'd be totally open to it and i think that's going to happen i think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer because now they own Obamacare they own it 100 percent donuts so basically he's trying to scare the one thing by the way the good news here is it's not just the freedom caucus was going to stand on their principles the Democrats are too stupid to you know to respond to this I mean Chuck Schumer has built his his fortress he's not coming around I don't think he's there's anything there there I think Trump is bacon Trump knows it I think he's basically scaring trying to scare the conservative straight basically trying to say you work with me you're gonna have to work with me or else I reach out to the Democrats which I'm not sure it's an actual possibility all right so who's to blame I ain't blame to go around I think there's blame to go around I mean first of all I think Trump didn't care about this and he pushed Ryan to just get something done because he wants to get to tax reform and by the way this is another problem with this miss bill did cut 1.2 trillion dollars in government spending which makes tax reform a doddle right I mean I then you then you can do tax reform any way you want right because you've got all this money that's not being spent so that's all the money that you can take out of the tax system until maybe the tax cuts cause there to be more money coming in now you don't have that feeling ceilings and now you know the guys like Paul Ryan they want a neutral tax cut in income neutral tax cut makes it a lot harder to do it's a lot harder to find that kind of money just lying around in the sofa in Washington that's one thing so come push cryin Ryan move too quickly I mean there is just no question that Ryan moved too quickly but basically he did this in secret he didn't bring everybody together he didn't get the consensus first that would have taken too much time he's let Trump Russian after all it's Ryan's you know one of the things you know I'm I'm an actual fan of Ryan but I think he screwed the pooch I mean I think that's basically it I think Ryan did screw the pooch on this and I think that he he basically thought that the Trump would bring the guys around he thought Trump would do is his deal making thing I don't think Trump cared enough to do it and and he just didn't get the consensus he needed because it would have taken too long it would have taken too long to get everybody together so that was that was well here's why and afterwards he just looks like basically he's been hit by a bowling ball I will not sugarcoat this this is a disappointing day for us doing big things is hard all of us all of us myself included we will need time to reflect on how we got to this moment what we could have done to do it better but ultimately this all kind of comes down to a choice are all of us willing to give a little to get something done are we willing to say yes to the good to the very good even if it's not the perfect because if we're willing to do that we still have such an incredible opportunity in front of us there remains so much that we can do to help improve people's lives and we will because that's I got to tell you that's why I'm here and I know which way every member of this conference is here to make this a better country we want American families to feel more confident in their lot in life we want the next generation to know that yes the best days of this country are still ahead of us I'm really proud of the bill that we produce it would make a dramatic improvement in our health care system and provide relief by people hurting under Obamacare and what's probably most troubling is the worst is yet to come with Obamacare you know one kind word for Ryan I always feel her you know the Conservatives always hate the Speaker of the House they hate to speak of the house because he's wrangling cats you know you forget that a lot of the people in the house are moderates you know this is a center-right country right it's not it's not a far-right country and so a lot of the people that he's dealing with the moderates and as he made compromises for with the freedom caucus for conserving he was losing the moderates he was losing you know he's book ended in so conservatives always hate the speaker of the house because he's a Wrangler you know and that's not what we want we want people of principle to stand up and shake their fists and all that stuff totally understandable but I will say on his on his behalf that he was dealing with a president who promised everyone would be covered right because the president has Democrat tendencies this way he was dealing with moderates and he was dealing with an absolutely intransigent freedom caucus who I do think has to take some of the blame and we'll talk about that in a minute but we gotta cut away from facebook and youtube come on over to the daily wire calm to hear the best-selling cultural correspondent Michael Knowles discuss really weird gender stuff which is just something he does it's kind of strange and also if you come over if you just come over and subscribe you know you
