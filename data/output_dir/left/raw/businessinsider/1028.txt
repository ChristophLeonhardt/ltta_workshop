00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,319
you just said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you want me to help</font>

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:03,449
you do the dishes I want you to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

3
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:05,370
do the dishes why what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,039
dishes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah almost nobody responds to</font>

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,590
criticism without becoming defensive in

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,019
some way so what you want to do is you

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,870
want to be alert to anything you might

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,029
say that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the person go</font>

9
00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:20,130
on the counter-attack to defend him or

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,560
herself you say something positive you

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,170
make the person feel aware of your love

12
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,699
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> support and what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is good</font>

13
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,980
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and then you you add the</font>

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,920
other bit it's a lot easier to hear the

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,370
hard things when somebody has reassured

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,070
you that you're loved you also need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

17
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">be really careful in conflict not to get</font>

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,000
into what I call shame trading somebody

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,230
does something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hurts the other</font>

20
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:49,260
person and then that person criticizes

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,690
the person who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is criticized then feels</font>

22
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,030
bad and tries to make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other person's</font>

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,129
feel bad and then you go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth</font>

24
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to figure out who's the one who</font>

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,210
deserves the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blame who's the one that</font>

26
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,280
ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be ashamed of his or her</font>

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,438
<font color="#E5E5E5">behavior this is a pattern you see all</font>

28
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:06,120
the time in relationship

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:00:00,000
