1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,140
TOMI LAHREN LIKE TO CONSIDER
HERSELF A FIGHTER FOR FREE

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,380
SPEECH.

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,610
SHE HATES COLLEGES LIKE BERKELEY
THAT WANT TO SHUT DOWN

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,190
CONSERVATIVE SPEAKERS BUT

5
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:14,540
RECENTLY SHE WAS AT THE STUDENT
ACTION SUMMIT THROWN TOGETHER

6
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,760
BY ATTORNEY POINT USA.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,029
DURING HER APPEARANCE SHE
REFUSED TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS

8
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,109
IN REGARD TO HER STANCE ON
ABORTION.

9
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:27,340
IF YOU CAN RECALL SHE GOT FIRED
FROM THE BLAZE BECAUSE SHE

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,340
SAID THIS?

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,789
>>I AM PRO-CHOICE.

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,200
I AM A CONSTITUTIONAL, SOMEONE
THAT LOVES THE CONSTITUTION.

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,330
I AM FOR LIMITED GOVERNMENT SO I
CAN'T SIT HERE AND BE A

14
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,330
HYPOCRITE.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,789
I CAN SIT HERE AND SAY THAT AS A
REPUBLICAN AND I CAN SAY I AM

16
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,180
FOR LIMITED GOVERNMENT SO STAY

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,089
OUT OF MY GUNS AND YOU CAN STAY
OUT OF MY BODY AS WELL.

18
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:51,970
>>
OKAY SO SHE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL.

19
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,590
REMEMBER SHE IS PART OF THE
RIGHT WING SO THEY DID NOT

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,649
LIKE THAT.

21
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,530
UNDERSTANDABLY SOME OF THE SUITS
WHO WENT TO THIS TURNING POINT

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,510
USA WANTED TO ASK HER ABOUT IT.

23
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,220
THEY GOT SHUT DOWN.

24
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,800
SHE ALSO WOULD NOT TAKE
QUESTIONS ABOUT COLIN

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,410
KAEPERNICK AND NFL PLAYERS
WHO WERE KNEELING.

26
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:36,440
THAT IS THE 
ONLY REASON WHY I

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:46,180
WANTED TO DO THIS STORY

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,130
BECAUSE OF THAT LAST COMMENT.

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,430
AND THERE WAS MORE DRAMA.

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,090
THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT IS THAT
SHE DECIDED TO ADDRESS THE

31
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,810
STUDENTS ON HER INSTAGRAM.

32
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:03,230
SHE REFERRED TO HERSELF AS A
ROLE MODEL AND ALSO SAID SHE

33
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,180
IS NOT GOING TO DO THINGS TO
PLEASE OTHERS, SHE WILL STAY

34
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,050
TRUE TO HERSELF.

35
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,890
I GUESS I ADMIRE THAT IF I
BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS BEING

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,890
SINCERE.

37
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,890
A COUPLE YEARS AGO SHE WAS
TWEETING ABOUT POPPING THAT

38
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,890
PUSSY.

39
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,890
SHE WASN'T REALLY CONSERVATIVE
BACK IN THE DAY BUT WHEN IT

40
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,890
BECAME SOMETHING THAT BROUGHT IN

41
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,890
MONEY, ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE IS A
CONSERVATIVE FIREBRAND.

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,890
SHE DID SAY THAT, NO ONE
REACTED TO IT.

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,890
SHE SAID POPPING MY PUSSY
ON TWITTER.

44
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,890
>>FIRST OF ALL THE PERSON
CALLING HER A SNOWFLAKE IS NOT A

45
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,890
LIBERAL, IT IS A PRO-LIFE

46
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,980
ANTIABORTION PERSON WHO WAS
SAYING WHAT HAPPENED MISS FREE

47
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
SPEECH?

48
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,780
I WANTED TO ASK YOU A
SIMPLE QUESTION, AND YOU'RE

49
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,810
GETTING PAID A LOT OF MONEY.

50
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,510
I PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO ATTEND
AND I CAN'T ASK A QUESTION?

51
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:40,510
WHEN

52
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,690
THEY SAY THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF
FREE SPEECH THEY DON'T MEAN

53
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,680
LITERALLY.

54
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,120
ALL THESE RIGHT-WING FIREBRANDS
THAT GO TO THESE DIFFERENT

55
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,350
COLLEGE CAMPUSES ACTUALLY GET

56
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,240
PAID HUGE MONEY.

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,930
THAT IS OKAY, OTHERWISE THEY
MIGHT NOT GO TO BAYLOR.

58
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,700
FREE MARKET, DIFFERENT CHOICES.

59
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,620
I GET IT.

60
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,010
BUT THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY IN
FAVOR OF FREE SPEECH IF IT IS

61
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,010
NOT SPEECH THEY LIKE.

62
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,514
THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF PAID SPEECH
WHERE THEY GET TO TALK AND YOU

63
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:07,514
GET TO SHUT UP.

64
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:08,514
THAT IS REALLY THE DEAL.

65
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:09,514
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU BROUGHT
THIS UP BEFORE BUT ISN'T THAT

66
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:10,514
THE FIRST TIME SHE HAS PULLED
OUT OF A SITUATION BECAUSE SHE

67
00:03:10,514 --> 00:03:11,514
CAN'T REALLY TAKE THE HEAT?

68
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:12,514
HAVE YOU DISCUSSED POLITICON?

69
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:13,514
>>NO.

70
00:03:13,514 --> 00:03:14,514
I NEVER DISCUSSED THAT.

71
00:03:14,514 --> 00:03:15,514
CAN I?

72
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,514
>> CAN I JUST SAY TOMI WAS
SUPPOSED TO DEBATE ANNA BUT SHE

73
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:17,514
DIDN'T SURPRISINGLY SO AND I

74
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:18,514
WONDER WHY?

75
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:19,514
IF THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH
PEOPLE THAT WOULD CHALLENGE HER,

76
00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:20,514
THEN MAYBE SHE WILL LIMIT
ACCESS.

77
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:21,514
I THINK THIS IS MORE HER STORY,
SHE IS TRYING TO DEVELOP A

78
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,514
PERSONALITY THAT IS PROFITABLE
FOR HER AND IF SHE CAN'T

79
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:23,514
MAINTAIN THAT THEN SHE IS JUST
GOING TO LIMIT ANYONE'S ABILITY

80
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,514
TO CHALLENGE HER OR TO PENETRATE
HER PAPERTHIN IDEALS.

81
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:25,514
>> I THINK THERE ARE TWO
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE WHO

82
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:26,514
ENTER POLITICAL COMMENTARY.LT

83
00:03:26,514 --> 00:03:27,514
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE
PRINCIPLED IN THE BELIEVE IN

84
00:03:27,514 --> 00:03:28,514
WHAT THEY ARE SAYING AND THEY
FEEL CONFIDENT TO DEBATE OTHERS

85
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:29,514
ABOUT THEIR IDEAS.

86
00:03:29,514 --> 00:03:30,514
THAT IS THE REASON WHY I HAD NO
PROBLEM DEBATING ANNE COU

87
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:31,514
OR ANYONE THEY WANTED ME TO.

88
00:03:31,514 --> 00:03:32,514
I BELIEVE IN WHAT I AM SAYING
BECAUSE THE WORK IS NECESSARY

89
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:33,514
TO BACKUP THE FACTS.

90
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:34,514
I DON'T KNOW WHO IS SMARTER
BECAUSE TOMI LAHREN IS

91
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,514
ROLLING IN THE DOUGH,
AND I AM NOT.

92
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:36,514
>> BUT THE REALITY IS SHE IS
PLAYING THE SAME OLD MAINSTREAM

93
00:03:36,514 --> 00:03:37,514
MEDIA GAMES AND ONLY DOING THE
THINGS THAT PAY HER THE MOST

94
00:03:37,514 --> 00:03:38,514
AMOUNT OF MONEY, GET HER IN THE
BEST LIGHT, AND THE HELL OUT

95
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:39,514
OF DODGE.

96
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:40,514
>> LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I HATE
MOST ABOUT THE STORY AND

97
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:41,514
INSPIRED ME TO GO ON HER
INSTAGRAM.

98
00:03:41,514 --> 00:03:42,514
THAT WAS HARD FOR ME TO TAKE A
SOMEONE WHO IS BEEN DRAINED

99
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,514
AROUND ARGUMENTATION, AND
PRESENTING STRONG COHERENT

100
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,514
ARGUMENTS.

101
00:03:44,514 --> 00:03:45,514
HER LAST POST WAS KNEELING FOR
JESUS.

102
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,514
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

103
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,514
>>I DON'T KNOW.

104
00:03:47,514 --> 00:03:48,514
>> AND WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING
IS SHE FOLLOWS TREVOR NOAH.

105
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:49,514
I STARTED LOOKING AT ALL THE
PEOPLE SHE FOLLOWS AND I THOUGHT

106
00:03:49,514 --> 00:03:50,514
THAT IS INTERESTING, SHE IS
PRESENTING THIS WHOLE MANICURED

107
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:55,060
IMAGE OF HERSELF THAT HAS KIM
KARDASHIAN INSTAGRAM PICTURES,

108
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,760
AND SHE HAS THIS OTHER SIDE THAT

109
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
SHE IS CONCEALING.

110
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,720
SHE ALSO FOLLOWS MASTER P
FOR SOME REASON.

111
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,510
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

112
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,550
I THINK THERE COULD BE A STUDY
DONE ABOUT THE MANY SIDES OF

113
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,990
HER.

114
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:15,080
>>SHE IS MAKING THAT DOUGH.

115
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,010
LOOK
CONSERVATIVE WOMEN MAKE MONEY.

116
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,940
PROGRESSIVE MONEY DON'T.

117
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,320
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:39,030
>> THAT IS HOW THE MAINSTREAM
MEDIA WORKS.

119
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:44,850
>> WITH THE EXCEPTION OF IF YOU
WANTED TO CRITIQUE ISLAM, I

120
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,510
COULD BE ROLLING IN SO MUCH
DOUGH IF I CAME OUT AND SAID I

121
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,530
DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE HEADSCARF
AND ISLAM, I AM A FORMER MUSLIM.

122
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,680
I WOULD HAVE THAT CNN
CONTRIBUTOR CONTRACT LIKE THAT.

123
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,420
>> IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK OUT
AGAINST YOUR OWN GROUP, IT IS A

124
00:05:03,420 --> 00:00:00,000
GUARANTEED CONTRACT AT FOX NEWS.
