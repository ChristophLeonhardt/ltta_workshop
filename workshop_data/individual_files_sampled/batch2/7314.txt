company of Fox News seems not to know what movies are let me explain Jamie Lee Curtis she is in the movie Halloween it's the 11th installment of the of Halloween she started off in the original and she's reprising her role she tweet she this is the tweet from Fox News it says Jamie Lee Curtis wields firearms in her new Halloween movie despite advocating for gun control they got her no damn it they ladies and gentlemen they got her if you want to see an airtight argument it's that one yeah yeah and they can and they it you know is that that movie also features this guy Michael Michael Myers yeah and the hypocrite who plays him is not in even in favor of serial killers he's not i eyes checked I checked his Twitter account not Pro serial killers total hypocrite but play one but playing one in a movie okay I also went to Joe check Al Pacino does not want you to meet his little friend okay in real life total hypocrite has it mowed down anyone with a with a with a machine gun and in real life he's not even he doesn't even have a ridiculously terrible Cuban accent in real life the nerve of this baby hypocrite Al Pacino does not sleep on piles of cocaine jerk here's so it's one of those things where like I now need to find what the hell they're even trying to say mm-hmm this is what they're saying essentially Jamie Lee Curtis she has made statements against assault weapons a pro gun control pro common sense gun control legislation stance here are some tweets she said in the past one is assault weapons ban now she's repeated that another one can we take the word control out of the debate and call it gun safety nothing changes unless something changes by the way that is a weakened sin like we'll call it gun safety we'll do whatever you want I want to actually not even weaken but like more specific I'm not trying to take all guns away stance they're trying to say that because she tweeted this and then in a movie where she's trying to stop a mythical seemingly undead murderer she uses and she doesn't even use assault weapons in the movie they were showing like here in the in the actual body of this article it was like here she is in the trailer having multiple guns but in that she doesn't have assault weapons she has a shotgun and a handgun mm-hmm yeah but then again they do tweet it so it must be an airtight defense so look she's for gun safety and I don't know what kind of a monster is for gun safety okay so I'm glad they finally opposes it you know exposed as hypocrite for who she is I mean obviously Fox News not in favor of gun safety but actually that might be true because you remember this the the not in case of guns but in case of weapons they're not necessarily for safety one of the Fox and Friends anchors threw an ax in the middle of New York City in the sidewalk because they thought that was a good idea for a segment for a morning segment we're not gonna cook today on the show now there was a bull's-eye you're gonna be shocked to find out he missed it went over the bow spike and actually hit someone on the other side okay the guy had to be hospitalized now luckily the the blade didn't hit him unless he might have literally killed him okay this like maybe Halloween takes place in a mythical world where there are like common sense gun laws because Michael Myers uses a that's the fiction not that he's his undead entity that despite how many times they think they got I mean keeps rising from that raises rising from the dead he brought I mean he has a machete that's what he uses right maybe in this world that she's in he goes and tries like can I please get a gun and they're like oh no you're psychotic you are a documented in ten movie serial killer you can't have a gun and still he isn't I imagine how many people he would kill if he had a gun yeah you know what that is that's amazing that actually the this Halloween a movie a horror movie horror is actually a better scenario than what we have today in America because our serial killers like a gun yep of course you can have a gun right dan our races you could have anybody can have a gun e if you're on a terrorist watch list you could have a gun you got mental problems you're gonna have a gun any your your Michael Myers well of course you can have a gun I think I walked in with that mask on they're like yellow and her taste like new spokesmodel uh-huh the Halloween franchise has a zero rating from the NRA because yeah and and look finally III do have to confess though I did catch one other hypocrite it's Joe Pesci it turns out he's not four in favor of beating people with a phone in real life or stabbing them with a pen he's not in favor of either one of those things and yet I watched casino and what am I see this was is it come here come here but he's never done it in real life hypocrite so good there if you want more like tweets of that kind you can go online here's some other ones wait until they hear about how anti eating humans Anthony Hopkins is in home alone to Donald Trump helps a child separated from his parents but in real life oh it's actually really good I didn't see that one he's helping kids but in the real world he separated them from his parents mmm it's amazing I believe that actually is hypocrisy two easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second
