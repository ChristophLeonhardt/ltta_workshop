former Trump campaign aide sam nunn Berg is here with me live right now this is his first on-camera interview since nunberg made some news late today saying he received a new grand jury subpoena from Bob Muller and he plans to defy it I'm gonna interview Sam about that right now here's the context nunberg is the first witness to publicly say he will not cooperate with this Muller probe that's an announcement that shook the political and legal world late today is just about everyone with any stake in the Malheur probe was assessing the meaning of a former Trump campaign aide vowing to defy the special counsel which can theoretically land a person in jail and while the White House generally tries to avoid specific comments on the Malheur probe the president's spokesperson specifically rebutting nunberg just this afternoon and disavowing collusion he just said what MSNBC moments ago I think he meeting the President may have done something during the election but I don't know that for sure I definitely think he doesn't know that for sure because he's incorrect as we've said many times before there was no collusion with the Trump campaign Sam Nunn Berg was one of Donald Trump's first hires on this campaign they did have a falling out in August 2015 his pledge to defy Muller today comes along with an extraordinary revelation nunberg taking the public inside mullahs probe and showing us this list of people these are the people according to Nunn Berg's materials that the special counsel wants more information on Sam Nunn Berg thank you for coming on the beat for yours thank you for having me on when we last spoke when you were at this table yes sir you were cooperating with this probe why now tonight do you say you won't well when I look at this for the period of November 1 2015 to the present please provide all documents related to the following individuals Carter page never spoke to him okay never spoke to Cory Lewandowski hope Higgs I mean speak to them they forced me out of the campaign they push they push Roger out of the campaign Keith Schiller Keith is a friend of mine why do I have to give them my personal communications Steve Bannon Roger stone Rogers my mentor I email re with Roger 15 times a day okay and we had a big disagreement during 2016 because once again as you know and I've been honest about this I wanted Trump for lose I think care of Trump lost I thought it would be funny if go down this list of names some of them you say you don't have much material with some of them you say you do why won't you hand that over when last week you were willing to talk to these investigators because I talked to them I talked to them I've spent money on an attorney I've cooperated with them and when I got something like this and then they wanted me to go to the grand jury next Friday and I believe they're trying to start a case against Roger and the reason I believe that re you let's just be clear so everyone can follow this you're holding the subpoena from Bob Miller's office by the way let's just just so we have the facts your hole that's what you're holding here yes yes this is a requirement it's a requirement of as you say to get documents and material on those people and also for you to go in the grand jury room why do you think after you did the other interview do they want to make you go in the grand jury room because they're trying to set up a perjury case against Roger stone and I'm not gonna have and Rogers my mentor Roger is like family to me and I'm not gonna do it I'm not gonna do it and Roger did not talk Roger may have lied about it let me vote Roger did amazing that that view that they're gone wrong since I gotta use you to get to Roger based on a theory or based on the questions they asked you based on the questions they asked me I have no idea in advance what they wanted for the grand jury but what they do what they did tell me was I wasn't gonna be a subject or target and I was gonna get the same kind of immunity but they wanted something now re let me just say something immunity yes re let me say something sure the idea that we had some major plot with Roger with Donald Trump after he corey lewandowski the minute he got hired he was yeah he was I don't to be he let me put it this way he ran a scam to hyoeun okay that's my opinion corey lewandowski the minute he got hired one in Roger and me out but you think Muller's investigation I think Corey was in there Corey told them a lot of stuff about us and let me trying to say did they say that to you or your lawyer said my lawyer I haven't communicated directly with them and when you say they're after Roger has Roger in any way encourage you not to cooperate no he's not in fact Roger may be very upset a lot of people may be very upset I don't think this is but have this been done before especially with something like that people are upset I think and I'm gonna speak to you as a human being I think there's two reactions right now I think some people are worried about you and they're worried about what you're doing I think other people are upset because we just showed the white house which doesn't want to comment on this responded you so clearly you should shut up frankly you're in the eye of a storm era should shut up let me ask you this she's a terrible she's a terrible community let me ask you this by the way her by the way her presidential the one the person she defends every day he has a 35 percent approval rating she should shut her mouth let me ask you the important question yeah do you understand and I'm warning her by the way to shut her mouth do you understand that you have a legal obligation to comply yeah I have a legal technically I have a legal obligation but Robert Mahler and the team is gonna have to decide if they really want me to give every communication I had with Steve Ben and a Roger stone well sir I think they've decided and let me read to you because this is important defying a subpoena is a jailable offense I'm reading to you here under the rules the court may hold in contempt that's funny it's obeys a subpoena if you're saying that they've set a Friday deadline in your mind they wanted a 3 p.m. deadline for the documents and then a Friday deadline for you to go in there yes yes and I'm not going so if you're not going are you prepared to be held in contempt to potentially go to jail yes and you know why why yeah why tell us because when they asked for something like this to me and the way they treated and reu and I can disagree about it but though and once again Donald Trump is responsible for this investigation because he was so stupid after you fired Comey he had the lesser whole interview and he had the Russians in his office but if they're gonna do something like this after the way they treated all the Hillary people with the emails during that investigation I'm not gonna have it so because they just want to get the facts because it's a lot flying here for people you're making two serious claims though about what Muller's asked of you number one you're saying that they subpoenaed this information about these other Trump officials by 3:00 p.m. today and that deadline has passed and you're now you're saying in defiance of it yeah correct I'm not gonna know over 50,000 you're saying this is not a pledge that you will violate but now you are not complying with that deadline something like this is so ridiculous after I went down there after by the way I spent money on illegal you know for a lawyer and a lot of other people have spent a lot of money and it's not fair it's really not fair now once again it's Donald Trump's responsibility that this investigations going on mm-hmm and I built and as I've told you I think it was a hundred percent right that roses that he started this independent council not because Trump fired called me which I'd agreed with because Trump gave them less their whole interview and had the Russians and the the the things he said about why he did it let me ask you a question that's not about the law yes sir you and I have both been around these types of situations these types of probes they can be very stressful even for people who are completely innocent did nothing wrong it can be stressful how are you holding up and do you want to take more time to think this through could you change your mind I'm not gonna answer something so why does this this is so ridiculous I'm not gonna give them every email I had with Steve Banta and Roger stone I communicate with them every day and are you are you feeling okay you feeling stressed out by this no and I'm feeling kind of I want to see what mr. Muller does it's never been done before once again and here's where we go where you're very fair about this you can leave I think that there's a hypocrisy mm-hmm I think that there's two separate rules for Democrats and Republicans I want to see if they're gonna do something to me about this after the way they treated Hillary Clinton during the we investigation let's see that let's see it let me ask our tour page I mean I mean re look at this Cory Lu do you think I talked to Cory November 1 I despised Cory if I could see it if I could find Cory in an alley it wouldn't be very nice well well here's the question since you guess sir if you're showing this and this is your choice if you don't talk to Cory much and you don't have a lot of material of you and Cory going back and forth then this wouldn't be very onerous at all but the issue isn't that it's owner√≠s the issue is why is the government asking for my communications when they know they're casual and they know that I collude and we do not wash the short time there let me let me try to be fair the short answer for me is I don't know cuz I'm not inside the probe but let me put it this way to you are you aware that they may already have all of that I think they do but they had they definitely do they definitely had they definitely had Roger stones emails and so one of them asked me questions about Roger stones even they asked me questions about Roger and me that they would only have had Rogers emails the questions they asked you in your previous interview suggests yes so we're already reading your private communications of the Roger stone yes sir yeah yeah so that goes to a point to Preet Bharara who I'm sure you've heard of the federal prosecutor very nice guy I like his podcast by the way well this is what he said in response to what you've done today he said I'm prepared to bet special counsel mother's team already has numbers emails even if you have them from other parties or from the service provider you asked for them anyway among other things you learn a lot when people selectively disclose and so wait this is an important question Sam don't you think it's possible that what they're testing here is not against you assuming you would completely comply but against other people if they withheld incriminating emails here's what I would say Ari is Roger stone is like a surrogate father you feel loyal to him and I'm not gonna go in there for them to set up a case against Roger Roger did not do anything Roger and I were treated like crap by Donald Trump okay the fact that I was fired for Facebook posts which were fine racially intensive do you think that would have cost us a vote well and you and I spoke about that and you actually apologized for that I apologize sure so I know that history they live in that quarry let me ask my dad why and then Trump was ready to let Cory and the buyer Raj and those are old campaign scores and an investigation of a campaign is hope exe hope x2 hope aches giving Cory's girlfriend his paramour let's stay with let's say I think I contacted her let's stay on track on what the best serve is looking at because I think you have gotten attention of a lot of people tonight as I mentioned yes sir Rove is looking at whether people are complying you seem if I'm reading you right the best case of reading of what you're saying is an inference that they are out to get you or Roger but you don't really know that because if you guys comply and didn't do anything wrong you don't think Bob Miller from what you said last week is gonna make up a case against he's making up a case but I think that this is to buck that I think that the this request is too wide and he's not fair not fair let me play for you what you said about these and I said they're very professional but this is let's let's take a look at that but all right let's take a locate this was like a white-shoe law firm going in okay I'm sat in there they asked me questions they had charts out they had specific things they wanted to know they had follow-ups it was almost like flow charts it wasn't a waste of taxpayers money to have me in there wasn't a waste of time for me either and I'm happy to have been there and I'm happy to have cooperated is that still your view because that's my view then it wouldn't be too broad it would be that they're like a wino being diligent I'm asking you know my point is is that I was so honest I cooperated I didn't say call me to the grand jury when they first when they first contacted me and after that after sitting there for so many hours after paying the money for a lawyer I think it's something like this and I can and re I have to earn a living mm-hmm you know I know I you know I know Bob Muller I know I know that whole team and they and their ride and they probably have something on Trump Trump did something pretty bad if I understand what do they have I don't know I have no idea but they have something do you think they were more injured in Trump related to the criminal hacking which occurred and we know there were stolen emails are in relation to all the social media and I think that were interested in something with his business with his business yes they asked you about the way he run his business yes he asked me about his business and I have no by the way I've no idea what he did and he may not have done anything and I could a wrong felt they were asking you more about potential crimes related to the Trump Organization than related to the Trump campaign that's what I felt yeah well that was your interpretation that was huh let me ask you this do you think that these investigators are escalating against you for a reason because you did say something that's true and you know there are people out there that are that are wondering what you're doing there people as I mentioned that are worried are you doing something that's adverse to your interests wait and there are people saying okay does he have a point what you just said is true that an interview is more cooperative and you did that cooperation and now they're bringing you before the grand jury do you have any reason to know why they're appearing to escalate against you in that way our strategy was not to ask why they wanted me at the grand jury once again as I was told I am NOT a target mm-hmm I am NOT a subject of the investigation which would if true what they wanted but they wanted something I said to them and that interview they want and at the grand jury do you think they wanted it to put on record for testimonial purposes to use against someone later yes of course yeah well you say of course we're all everyone's trying to okay yes yes yeah you might be ahead of where some people are so you think they want you in the grand jury room and you're a lawyer too you understand the way it works right and the great needs grand juries they build a game they want you and the grand jury room to build that case against someone else yes and here's that person is I don't know you don't know and if it's Roger I'm not going to testify against Roger Roger did not do anything Roger was treated terribly by Donald Trump and he's one of Donald Trump's oldest advisors yeah but Trump is the most disloyal person you've ever gonna meet I don't know if you do comply with this and you go in the grand jury room you know you have to go in there alone without a lawyer that's the issue isn't about me going in there I have no problem telling them what I what I said in there the issue is is I don't think this is fair this is over this is what bi that I can't the Carter page corey lewandowski hope hicks I mean Corey Lewandowski and hope Hayek's colluded to get Roger me fired okay Carter page never met the guy in my life never made I think do you think harder page as criminal exposure I think Carter page colluded with the Russians and I've told you that before I've told you that privately I think he colluded with the Russian how many people do you think he told he was doing that with on the campaign I don't know I don't know I don't think he told a lot of people cuz I don't think he had a lot of power in the campaign I don't think he had a lot has been a lot of talk about how Muller has not yet done anything in an indictment level regarding collusion do you think what you just said your allegation the Carter page colluded with the Russians do you think Muller has that from multiple witnesses I have no idea I no idea would be good from you no no I never spoke to Sam Nunn Berg thank you for being here I have another update you're welcome to stay at the table and you want them to continue to participate I want to give viewers a little more context on what is a big development until today think about it like this every single person who has spoken publicly about this Muller probe who's been involved has at least publicly said they'll cooperate I'm looking forward to it actually very okay to explain to the special counsel you know whatever whatever responses are required we will continue to cooperate with Bob Muller in his investigation will continue to cooperate and comply I'm more than happy to be transparent about it and I'm more than happy to cooperate with everyone and yet today as we just saw a different tack I want to turn to attorney Maya Wiley who's a former counsel of the mayor of New York City and a talented and knowledgeable legal analyst for us and you were also at this table with mr. nunberg who is still with us the last time he was here and he spoke about what was again for viewers following this the FBI interview that's not the grand jury box that's an FBI interview now what you just heard from him your analysis well I'm really quite flabbergasted at the statement that Sam you don't believe that there is anything that you would share that would implicate Roger stone in a crime and yet you would not actually come forward in a grand jury and then you repeat the statements you've made already directly to federal prosecutors in front of a grand jury it's rather astounding certainly the way I've seen the subpoena it is a reasonable subpoena it does not sound like a huge random fishing expedition mr. never used the word broad is your view that it is very broad or then it seems targeted it seems pretty targeted to people who are directly implicated in the investigation already by many things if there are emails that do not exist they can't be turned over and it can't be burdensome to produce them let me ask you this a mr. number who's who's taken time to be on the show before which I appreciate he said many things some of them shocking some of them may have been based on conjecture he did say one thing that I mentioned earlier that struck me as very reasonable and something I've heard from a range of people caught up in this situation which is if I cooperated and I didn't do anything wrong and I've been told I'm not the target and I'm spending all this money why is it getting more pressure on me why the heat what did you think of his concern there that might be animating how he's feeling I think it's a very human response to being in the witness in an investigation it's stressful it is time-consuming there's no question that in the process of trying to get to the truth which remember it is the grand jury that will decide whether or not to indict so that the grand jury can hear the evidence that the prosecutors have heard in order to understand the facts and circumstances that are being brought to them so to sort of suggest that talking to the prosecutors is sufficient in the context of an imp annulled grand jury is sort of saying let's have justice with both eyes not just closed but gagged and completely unable to engage in a cross and this is her and this is where I'll disagree with you respectfully is that I felt they were very bias against Roger when I was in there I felt that they're going after Roger I felt Paul Manafort and Ric Gates did illegal things and they couldn't pay the taxes I don't know why they didn't want to pay the taxes and they worked for Russian oligarchs Roger didn't work for Russian oligarchs they went after they ask me things in other words once again as I just mentioned earlier ma'am is that ask me things like was this some grand plot by Roger and me to get fired and then I would work for Ted Cruz and then we would collude with the Russians I mean it's ridiculous so Sam said here last week on Wednesday that this was an extremely professional and highly skilled team so the notion that they were asking questions first of all does not mean they were suggesting that the question that there was answers that would be true or false right only that there were things that they were going to pursue the fact that they asked them in and of themselves has nothing to do with what they will ultimately do decide to take to the grand jury if we had a justice system that said that witnesses could decide the guilt or innocence of any particular individual and therefore not cooperate and make that legally permissible essentially we would not have any system at all can you speak to that structural point that that miss Wylie raises because what she's saying is I think wait wait okay I just want to be clear though you get you know you get time I know whatever you do what she's saying is that you may have put it in the best light possible you may have a good faith honest belief in your position and the innocence of your very dear friend and I think anyone who's fair who's watching can relate to that it sounds like you care a lot about someone and you think they're in the right he's my mentor and word of it mm-hmm and I think if anyone's if anyone's fair and honest and thinks about the person that in their life that's in that role they could understand the feeling you have and yet Maya Wiley is saying something that's broader than that which is you have as I mentioned earlier in the interview you have an obligation or federal law to comply because it's not your call or my call or my is call it is the call of justice which we have prosecutors here charge federal courts to adjudicate what do you say to her point that it's not your call I say one you're right and I'm making it my call but here's what I also say why do they not invite Podesta Podesta's brother I only Podesta probably has according to the reports significant foreign lobbying exposure here mana for a judge it prejudge it but one person because it's not over because here's what I hear what I would say and and here's where we can agree to disagree I know he's find that with these investigations weather was scooter libby weather was any of whether they didn't charge hillary clinton that there's always a reason some that the democrats don't get tried and the republicans do now you're gonna laugh you are gonna laugh at me but you explained to me why she didn't get indicted she hid her emails well but but i i'm gonna use moderators privilege and say yes sir you're trying to change the topic not much the reason you're here is you seem to be taking a position that is befuddling and and really affecting a lot of people and people are wondering is it the right decision for you and is it the right decision under law and here's why by the way once again rogers my mentor rogers like a father to me i don't care they could take down Donald Trump take him down if he did if Donald Trump did something take them down so you're saying you would protect Roger but not trunk I'm not going to go into a grand jury for them to set up a case against Roger whatever case it is which could be ridiculous if it's ridiculous there's no reason for you not to go and help you have a great sharing what you know the suggestion and the in what you're essentially projecting to me as an attorney is that you're actually protecting them because there's something to protect there's nothing so you would do more service to your mentor by demonstrating that he has nothing to fear if as you say there nothing in the emails you as far as you know have never seen or heard any contact between him WikiLeaks Russians that comes to calculating these statutes they take these statutes as you know is a US Attorney and they're so broad they could find a way to just charge you're worried just to be clear you're worried they could make a case against Roger stone I'm worried that they're trying to make a case against Rogers that their that their court that they're maneuvering what would that case be bill I have no idea I have no idea but it's ridiculous would it relate to wiki leak tell you once again would it relate to WikiLeaks it could relate to WikiLeaks and here's the other thing what I would tell you once again and I wanted to be so and I've been very honest here rod I was fired Roger quit we were treated like crap by Donald Trump we had Roger could have done whatever he wanted and I had a fight with Roger about this I was happy to see Trump loose Tory some do you think the president saw your last interview on on this show he did and you know what I don't care you know that he did know I said yeah yeah what do you want to say to him tonight I don't care you know whatever I don't care what he thinks you know I don't care once again I worked for him from 2011 to 2015 he had separate sets of rules for Roger and me when he hired corey lewandowski who he thought left the cokes to go work for Trump which he did and Cory was fired and that's a fact and Cory can come on your show and dispute it he decided that we were trashed and then as I've told you he treated Michael Kohn very badly are you worried about Michael yeah like I I'm worried about Michael because I I don't by Michael did not do any I don't know I'm gonna bring in a former federal prosecutor who also has expertise on this but let me ask you this question does your lawyer think what you're doing now tonight is a good idea I have no idea I think he may have dropped me frankly I don't know I definitely know my father doesn't like it my father was my one of my co-counsel I think your family wants you home for Thanksgiving and I hope you will testify I think no it's not ridiculous Sam November not radicular 1 2015 I talk because 15 times a day from November 1 well talking to them an email two different things so they could subpoena your phone records as well and they're welcome to but my point is if you had email exchanges with them during a period that is under investigation with people who have clearly been implicated in some way that doesn't mean they've committed a crime but it clearly have been implicated in transactions that relate to understanding whether or not there was a violation of federal law here then it is a completely reasonable request to ask for those emails from November 1 2015 it was the period of the campaign in which there were I was all you have to do is go back and the to the press by the way to the present to the president yes as promised hang with me I want to bring in a former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade I guess I will begin with a point that Sam raised have you ever seen anything quite like this no I haven't typically people comply with grand jury subpoenas you know there are a few bases that a witness can use to object to a grand jury subpoena one is if they have some sort of privilege like a Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination attorney-client spousal privilege or the like or if they believe that the request is unduly burdensome and the remedy there is to file a motion to quash with the court and ask the court to narrow the scope if that is granted then a prosecutor might say we'll ask you for fewer documents if this is unduly burdensome but other than those circumstances if witness refuses then I do think they face contempt of court and possible jail in contempt of court as mr. Neuberger and I were discussing earlier can bring jail I'm not going to jail come on let me let me let me put it to the federal prosecutor and and you're still here so you're part of the discussion but Barbara if we take mr. Nunn Berg's argument in the best possible light as a legal argument it would be something that you just referred to which is maybe this is an over broad request and it should be narrowed now typically as I think we all know and as viewers will know because this does feel so unusual typically that would be a private set of negotiations through lawyers and not played out in public and from what we know about the Miller probe that is not the preference of the investigators so your view of that aspect of this Barbara and what they may or may not or legally could do with a witness who is divulging so much yeah I mean the first step would be for a lawyer to communicate with the prosecutor and ask if the scope of the subpoena could be near if that is refused then to file a motion to quash but short of that I think that a judge could very well hold a witness in contempt and I would think in a case like this where a witness is so publicly defying the subpoena power of the special prosecutor I would believe that a prosecutor would feel a very strong desire to file charges to file a motion for contempt because you have to think about the deterrent effect that that might have on other witnesses who are out there not just in this case but in every case going on across the country so Barbara another follow up on that to you and then mr. number your response if you want but Barbara what you're saying is under the law we're not here to predict but you're staying under the law based on what's happening at mr. nunberg zone account that there was one grand jury subpoena documentary' deadlines that he's passed now today and the other one is testimonial that is him going in that he vows to defy you're saying they would be in their legal rights to file a contempt proceeding at what point well I do you know again I think lawyers typically try to work things out if if a witness says I don't have enough time to go through the emails you've requested you can ask for an extension of time for those things so there can be an attempt to work things out I would imagine there would be a request is you really define our subpoena because I've heard a lot of reasons I've heard unreasonable I've also heard I don't want to incriminate my mentor Roger stone which would not be an appropriate exercise of the Fifth Amendment right which is about self-incrimination not against incriminating others so I think they would want to clearly define what is the basis for your objection do you just need a little more time or are you truly define this subpoena and if it's the latter I do think a motion for contempt of court would be appropriate and you asked about other if I've ever seen anything like this the one example that comes to mind is Susan mcdougal who refused to testify for the special counsel in the investigation of Bill Clinton she was held in contempt and was jailed for 18 months for that contempt so Sam your reaction to hearing that laid out here by a federal prosecutor and your reaction to I think the implication of what miss McQuaid just said which was I'm gonna put this against try to be fair but try to be accurate yes you are be fair what I meant to say sounds bad but I'm gonna say it to you the implication of what she is analyzing there under the is that the way you are speaking out and you've spoken out several times today this is not the first time you've spoken out today the way you're speaking up she said is actually potentially hurting undermining the type of case you might make for why you shouldn't have to testify because you're putting forth the idea that you might not want to testify to protect someone else's conduct well I'm not protecting Rogers conduct what I would say is they went after Paul manna for it they went after gates now Paul Manta fording gates I've never spoken to I met Paul once at a Yankee ALCS they went after them from the very beginning for activities earlier than the campaign if they're trying to build a case against Roger I'm not gonna be part of it I'm not Roger didn't do anything Roger didn't do anything except get treated like crap by Donald Trump the president you keep saying you don't think there'll be a consequence what if the cause for that is going to jail Sam they're not gonna send me to jail you know what mr. Muller if he wants to send me to jail he could send me to jail and then and then I'll laugh about it and I don't make a bigger spectacle that I am on your TV show right now well sir I don't know what they're gonna do I don't I don't know that and I can't prejudge it I know you can't yeah but but miss McQuaid Barbara if you would speak to Sam's point he's saying that's not going to happen you just outlined again a different case not a prediction but a different place where the refusal to testify did result in lengthy time in jail yeah I don't want to give mr. number glial advice he certainly should consult with his lone lawyer about what he should do in this case but if his information and his evidence is that Roger stone did nothing wrong he should tell that to the grand jury the grand jury wants to find out the truth if he's got information truthfully that can exonerate any of these people that's information that's valuable to the grand jury as well ma'am and I'm telling should I go into the grand jury what if they want me again what is it how many times do I hand line if the grand jury wanted you again it would be because there was some additional information forthcoming during the investigation that they had not had the opportunity to ask you about so I think this is what's incredibly important here Sam you got immunity so you certainly don't have any reason not to testify right as you told today not only that not only that it actually makes it appear that Roger stone has something to hide because you will not go testify he has nothing to hide well then go testify you know what I'll tell you what okay so I don't mind about testifying I'm not gonna sit there for 80 hours or this document request I have real work to do I have to earn a living mm-hmm I don't think this is fair I don't think it's fair to ask me Paul man afford Ricki once again like I told you Corey Lewandowski hope Hicks do you think I was talking to Cory and hope Hicks I mean while they were having their affair after they screwed over Roger and me give me a break the harder Paige never met no let me ask you to boggle by the way look at this oh gee Donald Trump is number three on the listing that's not you're releasing I think that that's a problem when they ask that too well no now I would turn over anything but but no you wouldn't the whole point the reason you're here right now the reason we're talking about this is you're saying you won't turn over things that's the problem Sam it's been 80 hours going over emails with Steve Bannon and Roger stone because my E I mean Ari Roger and me and Steve we communicated like 50 times let me we talked about that this is my final my final search and I appreciate you sharing with us your thinking it is certainly newsworthy this is the final question yes sir you and again I say this forget the law forget the journalism forget that we're on a TV okay is it possible as someone listens to you and you talk so much about all of these people and you've been through something with them and you feel that you've been through something that's been unfair is it possible that in the heat of this you're having a very strong reaction based on on the strong feelings you have and that over time you might come around to a different view of this is it possible that this is coming in the heat of the moment I think that I think that in our discussion and what you said I would have no problem going to the grand jury but I once again don't want to have to spend 80 hours going over email you'd rather spend possibly a year in jail I'm not going to jail you think I'm going to do
