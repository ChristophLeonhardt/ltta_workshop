>>EARL GRANVILLE IS A VETERAN
OF THE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN
WHERE HE LOST A LEG, AS MANY OF
OUR SOLDIERS DID, LEGS, ARMS,
ALL THAT.
WHEN HE RETURNED TO
AMERICA FROM HIS SERVICE HE ALSO
RETURNS TO HIS HOBBY OF
COMPETITIVE ATHLETIC EVENTS, AND
ONE EVENT HE WAS IN WAS A
MULTI-DAY SPARTAN RACE IN THE
MOUNTAINS OF VERMONT THAT IS
FOCUSED ON ENDURANCE, MOUNTAIN
CLIMBING AND RUNNING THROUGH
HILLS AND ALL OF THAT.
TO
COMMEMORATE THIS DIFFICULT
ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENT HE TOOK A
PHOTO, HERE IS THE PHOTO.
YOU
SEE ON HIS T-SHIRT, THAT'S THE
NAME OF THE EVENT HE WAS IN, AND
THAT'S A STRIKING PHOTO.
HE JUST
DID SOMETHING I LITERALLY
COULDN'T DO RIGHT NOW, AND HE
DID IT WITH ONLY ONE LEG, SO I
WOULD LOOK AT THAT PHOTO AND
THINK THIS IS AMAZING, NOT JUST
FOR WHAT HE PREVIOUSLY DID IN
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY BUT WHAT
HE CONTINUES TO DO NOW, IT'S
INSPIRING.
THAT IS ME, OTHER
PEOPLE LOOK AT IT AND THINK I
COULD MAKE SOME MONEY, SO LET'S
BRING UP THIS NEXT PHOTO THAT
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN, WAIT A
SECOND, HIS SHIRT IS DIFFERENT,
IT SAYS I DON'T KNEEL.
WEIRD
THAT HE'S SUPPORTING THE PEOPLE
WHO DON'T WANT ATHLETES TO KNEEL
DURING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.
WEIRD.
HE FOUND IT WEIRD TOO
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T POSE FOR THAT
PHOTO, PEOPLE JUST PHOTOSHOPPED
AND BEGAN SELLING THE SHIRT BY
USING HIS IMAGE --
>>BY THE WAY, TO GIVE YOU AN
IDEA OF THE REACH OF THIS THING,
WHEN POLITICAL INSIDER POSTED IT
IS THAT 157,000 SHARES, THIS
IMAGE OF THIS SOLDIER
PHOTOSHOPPED AND SPREAD WITHOUT
HIS CONSENT, AND NOT JUST HIS
IMPLICIT LACK OF CONSENT, HE
SPECIFICALLY SAID 
NO --
>>IT ISN'T JUST THAT THEY
DIDN'T ASK HIM OR THEY DIDN'T
CARE, HE CONTACTED ONE PAGE IN
PARTICULAR, VETERANS PRIDE, AND
THEY BLOCK HIM.
THIS ISN'T A
RANDOM PROTEST, THIS IS A
PROTEST WHERE THEY SAY THEY ARE
ATTACKING AFRICAN-AMERICANS FOR
NOT RESPECTING THE FLAG AND OUR
COUNTRY AND CONCEIVABLY OUR
SOLDIERS, AND THEY ARE BLOCKING
THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE PROFITING
OFF OF TO SELL THEIR STUPID
T-SHIRTS.
>>FIRST OF ALL, I GET WHERE THEY
ARE USING THAT PICTURE, I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT EARL
GRANVILLE'S POLITICS, HE NEVER
SAID ANYTHING ABOUT HIS
POLITICS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE
THINKS ABOUT KNEELING, I GET
WHY THEY ARE USING THE PICTURE
BECAUSE THAT'S A MAN.
THAT IS
UNREAL, BLESS HIS HEART.
BUT TO
ME THE MOST AMAZING PART IS THE
LAST THING JOHN SAID.
HE REACHES
OUT TO THE COMPANY THAT CHANGED
ITS NAME TO IRONICALLY I KNEEL,
I'M NOT KIDDING, IT'S SPELLED I
KNEEL, THAT'S THE FACEBOOK PAGE
NOW, IT USED TO BE VETERAN TALK,
NOW IT'S ALSO -- NOW THEY ALSO
ARE USING VETERANS PRIDE.
NO ONE
KNOWS IF THERE IS A SINGLE
VETERAN INVOLVED IN THE
ORGANIZATION.
AND WHEN THE
VETERAN THEY USED IN THE ACTUAL
PICTURE REACHED OUT TO HIM, THEY
BLOCK HIM.
YOU WANT TO TALK
DISRESPECTFUL TO VETERANS?
AND
THERE IS ANOTHER PHRASE FOR
THIS, IT'S CALLED STOLEN VALOR.
THAT GUY LOST HIS LEG IN
AFGHANISTAN, NO MATTER WHAT YOU
THINK OF THAT CONFLICT HE SIGNED
UP, HE WENT, HE FOUGHT FOR US,
AND IN THIS CASE IT'S LITERALLY
STOLEN VALOR SO YOU CAN MAKE
MONEY OFF OF IT, AND THESE GUYS
TALK ABOUT RESPECTING THE FLAG
IN OUR MILITARY?
WE ARE
CONSERVATIVES, WE ARE GOOD GUYS,
RESPECT THAT FLAG, DON'T KNEEL
LIKE THOSE GUYS WHO WANT TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT POLICE
BRUTALITY, POLICE BRUTALITY IS
AWESOME, AND I'M FOR THE TROOPS.
OKAY, I'M THE GUY YOU WERE USING
THE PICTURE OF -- PISS OFF
VETERAN, WE DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT YOU, WE ARE MAKING MONEY
BY TRICKING PEOPLE.
>>I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR PAGE, VETERANS PRIDE,
OR POLITICAL INSIDER, WHO KNOWS,
BUT WE REPORTED IN THE LAST WEEK
THAT A LOT OF THESE FACEBOOK
PAGES WHICH WERE GETTING
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF SHARES
ON THEIR POLITICAL MEMES DESIGNS
TO STOKE RACIAL AND POLITICAL
DIVISION IN OUR COUNTRY DIDN'T
JUST NOT HAVE ANY VETERANS IN
THEM, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY
AMERICANS IN THEM BECAUSE THEY
WERE BEING RUN BY ANOTHER
COUNTRY.
I WILL BE MORE SPECIFIC
THAN THAT, DO YOUR RESEARCH.
>>THEY HAVE NO BOUNDS.
POLITICAL
INSIDER HAS AS A CAPTION IN THIS
PICTURE, THANK HIM FOR HIS
SERVICE, SHARE.
YOU COULD THANK
HIM FOR YOURSELF IF YOU ANSWERED
HIS CALL OR EMAIL OR FACEBOOK
COMMENTS SAYING I'M THE GUY, CAN
YOU STOP USING MY IMAGE?
BY THE
WAY MAYBE HE AGREES WITH YOU, I
DON'T KNOW, THEN YOU GIVE HIM
10%, I DON'T KNOW.
BUT FOR GOD'S
SAKE ANSWER THE GUY INSTEAD OF
STEALING FROM HIM.
>>VETERANS HAVE BEEN EXPLOITED
IN SO MANY WAYS, IF YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN IT, EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD
SEE THE PAT TILLMAN STORY, A
DOCUMENTARY CALLED THE PAT
TILLMAN STORY, YOU CAN SEE HOW
THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT EXPLOITS
OUR VETERANS TO BRING OTHERS
INTO SERVICE, HE WAS A GREAT
HERO, HE MADE MILLIONS IN THE
NFL, HE WAS IN THE PRIME OF HIS
CAREER, HE WAS MOTIVATED TO
SERVE IN AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE OF
THE 9/11 ATTACK, HE LOSES HIS
LIFE TO FRIENDLY FIRE, AND WHAT
DOES THE GOVERNMENT DO?
THEY
CREATE A STORY AROUND HIS LOSS
OF LIFE EVEN THOUGH HE LOST IT
TO FRIENDLY FIRE, THEY SAID A
TERRORIST TOOK HIM DOWN, THEN
THEY BUILD THIS MYTHOLOGY AROUND
HIM TO BRING IN MORE RECRUITS.
THAT'S OUR OWN GOVERNMENT WHO HE
HAS GIVEN HIS LIFE FOR
EXPLOITING HIS SERVICE FOR A
MESSAGE THEY WANT TO GET OUT
THERE.
IT IS HEINOUS, AND THIS
REALLY IS THAT, THE EXPORTATION
OF THIS GUY.
VENUE AT ALL THE
B.S. ON TOP OF IT, BLOCKING HIM
AFTER HE JUST TRIES TO ENGAGE, I
THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE
WITH MY PICTURE, IT IS
NAUSEATING.
>>AND TRUMP THE OTHER DAY TRIED
TO USE PAT TILLMAN AGAIN, AND
HIS WIFE WAS LIKE, NO, DON'T DO
THAT, THAT'S GROSS.
AND TILLMAN
DIDN'T EVEN AGREE WITH THE WAR.
HE LEFT AN NFL CAREER, HE WENT
TO FIGHT FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE
OF 9/11, AND HE IS LIKE I SIGNED
UP FOR IT, I THINK THIS IS A
MESS, BUT I'M STAYING BECAUSE
THAT'S MY JOB AND THAT'S MY
SERVICE.
HE DIES IN THAT
SERVICE, THEN THEY USE HIM AS A
POLITICAL PUNCHLINE.
IT'S NOT
EQUAL.
YOU MIGHT DISAGREE WITH
PROGRESSIVES, BUT GENERALLY
SPEAKING THEY DON'T DO THINGS
LIKE THAT.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY
LIBERAL WEBSITE, PROGRESSIVE
WEBSITE, WHATEVER, LET'S JUST
RIP OFF OF VETERAN, THAT WILL BE
FUN.
WHO CARES, LET'S MAKE MONEY
WITH HIM.
IF THEY DID THAT THE
MEDIA WOULD NEVER STOP TALKING
ABOUT IT.
CONSERVATIVES DO IT
WITHOUT BLINKING AND I AND THEN
THEY GO YES, I'M FOR THE
VETERANS.
AS LONG AS YOU ARE
MAKING A BUCK OFF THEM.
IT'S
DISGUSTING.
