Tell us how you [really] feel now are you so angry [don't] be angry?

28
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,398
This person doesn't really know proper sense of representative structure

29
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:15,670

30
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,729
Grammer! I'm sorry that we make you so angry

31
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,419
[I] actually heard a really good thing when I was in Jordan if you spot it you got it

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,599
It's not an amazing thing if you spotted you got it yeah, so for the people who hate

33
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,269
online or wherever

34
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,750
Usually when you spot something because you got it if you thought

35
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:42,179
goodness and people and happiness and joy and kindness because you also possess that so

36
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:48,779
If you think about it that deep knowledge, if [you] spotted you got it wow man slow clap

37
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,620
Why make your daughter so ugly faces question question question dislike

38
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,020
*singing fail music*

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,900

Because that just makes you look bad

47
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,489
No, it doesn't no one correct my spelling because it is like you know what I'm going to hate on this and I probably have

48
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,378
Really bad grammar or spelling so just in case you better not hate on me because I hate you

49
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:49,869
Just don't tell me that. I'm not good at spelling can we take a moment of silence for public education and

50
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,888
teachers and schools all over the world moment of silence

51
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,709

52
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:58,970

54
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:01,700
I thought I

55
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:08,709
Feel that we don't try to post anything that gives you a bad feeling or that makes you sad or uncomfortable

56
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,909
we try to

57
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,809
Give you lots of fun while you're watching our videos

58
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,320
Nice. Look wow this is like Slow Clap Version

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,639
Okay

60
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,119
Tell your daughter to stop singing

61
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,759
It's stupid there goes a bigger winter tray like always the same old bread and roll

62
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:34,989
Doodleball morning, just the same things in the morning [then] we came to this provincial sound good morning back

63
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,150
Horsham is Chris

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,479
charming

65
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:47,139
But she doesn't know let him to chapter [3]

66
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,990
Yeah, I don't think she's not [stopping]

67
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,810
[yes], sure sure

68
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,989
This family [is] so stupid the only reason they're famous there

69
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,109
They're famous is because they're suckers for money. [they'd]

70
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,039
probably

71
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,039
[drop] out of school

72
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
Okay, first, okay

73
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,639
There are so many grammar mistakes on this comment

74
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,499
That is annoyed like I am to the point where I am just fed up there are three bears

75
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,500
There's as in someone else possession with an eye

76
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:31,729
there are

77
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:38,318
The one as in they are four with an apostrophe, and then there is their like there's a bike over there

78
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:43,209
No, no, no, they don't know they don't know the meaning for any of the dare. So they're famous

79
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,669
We never did this to become famous

80
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:51,189
[we] just wanted to make videos and have fun and share them with the world [and] you guys [enjoyed] them so that's that

81
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:55,299
Nothing more nothing less. We have fun, and we're not so good for money

82
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:02,500
I want to talk report or not. I friggin hate your stupid ugly famous Wanna kids who thinks they can [sing]

83
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,560
For what is a mad?

84
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,209
Woman, what has he got if not himself?

85
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:14,619
then he has naught to say

86
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,569
nothing

87
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:21,729
He truly feels and not the words

88
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,150
of one who kneels

89
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,340
The record shows I took the blows

90
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,209
and it my

91
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,050
way

92
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,819
The thing here is whether you can sing or what you can't sing?

93
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,939
It doesn't matter as long as you have fun

94
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,449
And if it's something you love to do then do it just doesn't matter what other [people] think yeah, [do] what makes you happy

95
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,739
Yeah, you know what I think you're right. They are Wanna kids they want to sing

96
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,060
You ruined the whole song?

97
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,150
the Whole song

98
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,310
Well is the whole song oh

99
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:17,099
Wait, we all have [holes]

100
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,909

101
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:34,938
And we also have a hole over okay. This is from froggy [biggest] spiders are cool, but your channel is leaving stupid
