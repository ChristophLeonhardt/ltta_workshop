1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,770
TODAY DRAMATIC NEWS

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,260
INVOLVING THE SPEAKER OF THE
HOUSE.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,260
CENK?

4
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:11,420
>>[LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE GOT
HIM] DOWN GOES RYAN!

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,040
DOWN GOES

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,650
PAUL RYAN!

7
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,050
COME ON, YOU KNOW YOU
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,050
>>NO!

9
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,840
I WANTED HIM TO GO DOWN IN
NOVEMBER, I WANTED HIM TO LOSE.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
>>I KNOW.

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,840
THAT'S GOING TO BE A
HUGE PART OF THIS STORY AS WE

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,949
BREAK IT DOWN, WHY HE IS LEAVING
IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND PART OF

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,170
THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE
JUSTICE DEMOCRATS.

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,800
>>I'D SAY IT'S A PRETTY HEALTHY
PART OF THE REASON.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,910
>>AS I WILL EXPLAIN IN A BIT,
IT'S ABOUT 80% OF THE REASON

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,910
WHY.

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,810
I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S THE
OVERWHELMING REASON WHY HE'S

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:45,329
LEAVING, AND I SAY JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS BECAUSE RANDY BRYCE,

19
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,699
HIS DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT THERE,
IS A DEMOCRAT, ALSO KNOWN AS

20
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:49,699
IRON STACHE.

21
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,500
>>I WAS GOING TO SAY, I DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE THE LAST NAME, USE HIS

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
REAL NAME.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:02,190
>>IRON STACHE CHASED HIM
OUT WITH A CROWBAR.

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,460
WE WILL EXPLAIN ALL THAT, FIRST
JOHN WITH THE STORY AND WE

25
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,820
WILL RANK THE REASONS HE'S
LEAVING.

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,831
>>AS CENK SAYS WE ARE GOING TO
GIVE YOU THE REAL REASONS WHY HE

27
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:16,660
STEPPED DOWN, BUT BEFORE WE GET
TO THAT, HERE ARE REASONS HE DID

28
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,500
NOT STEP DOWN, DELIVERED BY PAUL
RYAN.

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,630
>>THE JOB PROVIDES INCREDIBLE
OPPORTUNITIES, BUT THE TRUTH IS,

30
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,810
IT'S EASY FOR IT TO TAKE OVER
EVERYTHING IN YOUR LIFE, AND YOU

31
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,740
CAN'T JUST LET THAT HAPPEN.

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

33
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:35,060
IN LIFE THAT CAN BE FLEETING AS
WELL.

34
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,411
NAMELY, YOUR TIME IS A

35
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:42,830
HUSBAND AND A DAD, WHICH IS THE
OTHER GREAT HONOR OF MY LIFE.

36
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,490
THAT'S WHY TODAY I'M ANNOUNCING
THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE MY LAST

37
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,940
ONE AS A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE.

38
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,200
TO
BE CLEAR, I AM NOT RESIGNING, I

39
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,200
INTENDS TO SERVE MY FULL TERM AS
I WAS ELECTED.

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
MY KIDS WEREN'T

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,890
EVEN BORN WHEN I WAS ELECTED,
OUR OLDEST WAS 13 YEARS OLD WHEN

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:03,900
I BECAME SPEAKER, NOW ALL THREE
OF OUR KIDS ARE TEENAGERS, AND

43
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,530
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED ABOUT
TEENAGERS IS, UM, THEIR IDEA OF

44
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,600
AN IDEAL WEEKEND IS NOT
NECESSARILY TO SPEND ALL OF

45
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,420
THEIR TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS.

46
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,280
WHAT I REALIZE IS IF I'M HERE

47
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,720
FOR ONE MORE TERM, MY KIDS WILL
ONLY HAVE EVER KNOWN ME AS A

48
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,860
WEEKEND DAD.

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,880
I JUST CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

50
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
SOME OF YOU KNOW MY

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,480
STORY, MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS
16, THE AGE MY DAUGHTER IS, AND

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,410
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF
THOSE PEOPLE LOOKING BACK ON MY

53
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,920
LIFE THINKING I COULD HAVE
SPENT MORE TIME WITH MY KIDS

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,090
THINKING IF I SPEND ONE MORE
TERM THEY WILL ONLY KNOW ME

55
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,450
AS A WEEKEND FATHER.

56
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,230
>>THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

57
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,670
BECAUSE OF
THE FAMILY.

58
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,540
>>I'VE NEVER HEARD IT BEFORE.

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,430
>>I WROTE DOWN FOUR PRINCIPAL
REASONS WHY PAUL RYAN IS

60
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,670
LEAVING, I FORGOT TO PUT FAMILY
DOWN.

61
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,940
THAT'S NOT WHY. AND HE

62
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,130
WILL SOON GET A JOB AS A
LOBBYIST OR AN "CONSULTANT" OR

63
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,290
"ADVISOR" THAT WILL PAY HIM AN
UNBELIEVABLE AMONG THE MONEY AND

64
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,040
BECAUSE OF THAT HE WILL BE GOING
BACK BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND NEW

65
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,460
YORK FAIRLY OFTEN ANYWAY, BY THE
WAY THAT JOKE ABOUT HIS TEENAGE

66
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,630
KIDS, THEY DON'T REALLY WANT TO
SPEND TIME WITH THEIR PARENTS,

67
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,630
THAT'S ALSO FLAT.

68
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,180
ON MY GOD,
THAT WAS AWKWARD.

69
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,310
IF EVERY

70
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,240
LEGISLATOR THAT HAD TEENAGE KIDS
LEFT TO SPEND TIME WITH THEIR

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,180
TEENAGE KIDS WE WOULD HAVE NO
ONE IN CONGRESS.

72
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,180
THAT'S CRAZY,

73
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
THAT'S NOT WHY.

74
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,760
THEY SAY THAT
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

75
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
NO SERIOUS

76
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,100
PRESS PERSON SHOULD EVER TAKE,
OH, "I LEFT BECAUSE OF MY

77
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,310
FAMILY" SERIOUSLY UNLESS IT'S AN
INCREDIBLY SPECIFIC CASE LIKE

78
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,209
SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, HER HUSBAND
HAD ALZHEIMER'S, SHE WANTED TO

79
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:52,420
SPEND A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME
BEFORE HE LOST RECOGNITION OF

80
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,090
HER, ETC., THAT MAKES SENSE.

81
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,540
THIS, I GOT TEENAGE KIDS WHO

82
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,970
DON'T WANT TO SEE ME ANYWAY?

83
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,970
WHAT?

84
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:01,130
NO, THAT'S NOT WHY.

85
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,460
>>JESUS.

86
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,800
WOW.

87
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,020
AS I SAID, THAT
WAS A PACK OF LIES, HE HAD

88
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,140
OTHERS, WE WON'T GO INTO THEM,
BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT SOME

89
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,680
REASONS HE MIGHT HAVE FELT LIKE
NOW WAS A GOOD TIME TO

90
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,380
TRANSITION OUT.

91
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:15,610
AS A SEGUE INTO
THIS, HERE IS WHAT HE SAYS ARE

92
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,209
HIS BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN
HIS TIME IN CONGRESS --

93
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,209
>>

94
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:40,740
>>SO HE'S 

95
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,380
TALKING ABOUT PASSING
TAX CUTS, AND PASSING THE

96
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,020
MASSIVE SPENDING BILL, BECAUSE
HE'S A DEFICIT HAWK, THAT'S HIS

97
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,800
REPUTATION, AND YOU WILL BE
SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT THE CBO

98
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,500
IS NOW PROJECTING AS OF THIS
WEEK THAT THE DEFICIT WILL REACH

99
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,730
$1 TRILLION BY 2020,
THAT HAPPENED IN RECORD TIME

100
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,630
UNDER HIS WATCH WITH DONALD
TRUMP.

101
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,590
>>LET'S BREAK THOSE TWO THINGS
DOWN.

102
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:05,630
HE HAS RAISED $54 MILLION

103
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,280
IN JUST THIS ELECTION CYCLE.

104
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,060
NOT
HIS CAREER, JUST THIS ELECTION

105
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,350
CYCLE, AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN
WARMED UP YET FOR THIS CYCLE.

106
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,350
WHY IS THAT?

107
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,690
BECAUSE HE WAS
ABOUT TO PASS TRILLIONS OF

108
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,320
DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS.

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,530
HE'S THE
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, AN

110
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,520
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POSITION,
HE GOES TO THE TOP REPUBLICAN

111
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,840
DONORS AND SAYS GIMME, GIMME.

112
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,580
THEN HE DOES IT OUT TO THE OTHER

113
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:28,210
REPUBLICANS AND THAT'S WHY WHEN
DONORS SAY YOU BETTER PASS THE

114
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,370
TAX CUTS OR ELSE WE WON'T GIVE
YOU ANY MORE MONEY, PAUL RYAN

115
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,980
SAYS ALL THESE BRIBES WILL END
IN A SECOND IF WE DON'T GIVE

116
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,110
THEM WHAT THEY BRIBED US FOR.

117
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,639
HE'S INCREDIBLY PROUD TO BE A

118
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,389
WATER BOY, I TAKE MONEY FROM THE
DONORS AND GIVE THEM TO THE

119
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,240
OTHER WATER BOYS IN CONGRESS WHO
ALL WORK FOR THESE DONORS, AND

120
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,669
THEN THE DONORS GET TRILLIONS IN
TAX CUTS.

121
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:55,669
PAUL RYAN HIS WHOLE

122
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,112
LIFE, HIS MAIN THING -- HE
DIDN'T SAY TAX CUTS WAS HIS MAIN

123
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:02,910
THING, HE SAID I WANT TO MAKE
SURE I GET THE DEFICIT UNDER

124
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,150
CONTROL, I CARE ABOUT A BALANCED
BUDGET.

125
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,110
THAT TAX CUT COST THE

126
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,110
BUDGET $1.9 TRILLION.

127
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,199
THAT'S A
DEFICIT.

128
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:13,199
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

129
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,370
THE OVERALL COST OF THE PACKAGE,
I'M TALKING ABOUT IT ADDED TO

130
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,430
TRILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEFICIT.

131
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,080
SO PAUL RYAN'S ENTIRE CAREER WAS

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,740
BASED ON A LIE, A TWO TRILLION
DOLLAR LIFE.

133
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,740
WHEN PUSH CAME TO

134
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,620
SHOVE HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE
DEFICIT AT ALL, ALL HE CARED

135
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,270
ABOUT WAS, HOW DO I DELIVER FOR
THE DONORS?

136
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,270
AND THEN THE DEFENSE

137
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,850
CONTRACTORS ARE A NICE SECOND
THOUGHT.

138
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,770
OH, BY THE WAY, ARE WE

139
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,460
SAFE FROM CANADA INVADING, OR
WHATEVER FANTASIES THEY HAVE IN

140
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,460
THEIR HEADS.

141
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,889
THE MEXICANS ARE
COMING, LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO

142
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:45,889
TAKE OVER THE COUNTRY.

143
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:46,990
SHARIA
LAW.

144
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,169
TOTAL NONSENSE.

145
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:49,389
NO, IT'S TO

146
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:54,139
GET LOCKHEED MARTIN AND BOEING
AND ALL THOSE COMPANIES UNGODLY

147
00:06:54,139 --> 00:06:58,550
SUMS OF MONEY BECAUSE THEY ARE
HUGE DONORS TO THE REPUBLICAN

148
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,550
PARTY.

149
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,310
AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S
QUOTE UNQUOTE PROUD OF.

150
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,570
>>THEY WILL ALSO NEED LOBBYIST
AS WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD

151
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,070
PUT THAT IN THE TOP FIVE OF THE
INDUSTRIES HE WILL END UP

152
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,820
REPRESENTING IN A YEAR OR SO,
BUT IT'S POSSIBLE, MENTIONING IT

153
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,820
ON YOUR WAY OUT MIGHT BE A WAY
TO GET A JOB WORKING FOR

154
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,450
LOCKHEED OR ONE OF THOSE
COMPANIES.

155
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,630
NOW, AS TO HOW LONG

156
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,990
AGO PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE
LEAVING, THIS CAME OUT --

157
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,990
>>

158
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:59,039
>>SO HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
INVOLVED IN THAT, NECESSARILY.

159
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,950
AND THERE ARE SOME RELATED
ISSUES TO THAT I THINK AS WELL,

160
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,070
BUT A LOT OF THAT TURNED OUT TO
BE TRUE, AND WHAT IS INTERESTING

161
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:08,160
IS POLITICIANS ARE SO DISHONEST.

162
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,680
LIKE, ARE YOU GOING TO RUN FOR

163
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
SOMETHING?

164
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,210
NO, I'M NOT GOING TO
RUN FOR THAT, I'M HAPPY SERVING

165
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,210
IN THE OFFICE I'M IN.

166
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,640
ARE YOU
GOING TO BE STEPPING DOWN?

167
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
NO,

168
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,640
DEFINITELY NOT.

169
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,490
WESTERN TO A
VIDEO JAYAR CUT FROM A COUPLE

170
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,889
MONTHS AGO WHEN POLITICO
REPORTED PEOPLE WERE SAYING

171
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:28,000
HE WOULD BE STEPPING OUT, THIS
IS HIS RESPONSE.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,688
>>THAT'S WHAT SURPRISES ME,
THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT IT WAS AN

173
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:33,688
IRRESPONSIBLE PIECE.

174
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:35,368
THE IDEA
THAT AFTER PASSING TAX REFORM,

175
00:08:35,369 --> 00:08:38,350
AS IF THAT THE ONLY THING I CARE
ABOUT, I'M JUST GOING TO GET UP

176
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,350
AND GO?

177
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,839
IT'S RIDICULOUS, IT
NEVER ENTERED MY MIND, LET ALONE

178
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,300
DISCUSSED IT WITH ANYBODY, SO I
REALLY SEE THIS AS SORT OF RANK

179
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,170
SPECULATION ON THE DC BELTWAY
PRESS SPECULATING THESE THINGS.

180
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,760
I THINK IT WAS FAIRLY
IRRESPONSIBLE SPECULATION, IT'S

181
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,149
FAULTY SPECULATION, I'M NOT
GOING TO GET UP AND LEAVE THIS

182
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,760
CONGRESS IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE TERM.

183
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,529
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO,
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT GOING

184
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:03,529
ANYWHERE SOON.

185
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:07,129
>>HE SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO PASS
TAX REFORM AND JUST LEAVE, WHY

186
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,459
ARE YOU ENGAGING IN RANK
SPECULATION?

187
00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:10,459
HE DIDN'T SAY FAKE

188
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,829
NEWS BUT HE WAS THINKING IT. AND
THEN WITHIN A MONTH THEY PASS

189
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:17,790
THE TAX LEGISLATION AND TWO
MONTHS LATER HE STEPS DOWN.

190
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,279
>>WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

191
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,480
THE ONLY
THING THEY CARED ABOUT WAS TAX

192
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,459
CUTS FOR THE RICH, THAT WAS
THEIR ONLY PRIORITY.

193
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:26,639
SO YES,

194
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,079
WHEN YOU GET INTO SPECIFIC
SUBSIDIES FOR THE DIFFERENT

195
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,029
INDUSTRIES, SURE, WONDERFUL, I
GET SPECIFIC THE REGULATION FOR

196
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,749
CERTAIN INDUSTRIES, YOU MAKE
MORE MONEY POLLUTING RIVERS AND

197
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:41,480
WATERS, GREAT, BUT THE TAX CUTS,
THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE

198
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,920
GOODIES, THAT WAS THE BIG
TREASURE CHEST.

199
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
THEY GOT THAT.

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,220
NONE OF THEM CARE ANYMORE.

201
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,059
AND I
SAID THIS FROM DAY ONE, THE

202
00:09:48,059 --> 00:09:51,589
MOMENT TRUMP TOOK OFFICE, I SAID
THERE OVERWHELMING PRIORITY WILL

203
00:09:51,589 --> 00:09:53,830
BE TAX CUTS, THEN THEY CAN
IMPEACH HIM, DO WHATEVER THEY

204
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,819
WANT WITH HIM, IT DOESN'T
MATTER, THE ONLY THING THAT

205
00:09:56,819 --> 00:09:57,889
MATTERS IS TAX CUTS.

206
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,889
OKAY.

207
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,029
SO
WHY IS PAUL RYAN ACTUALLY

208
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:01,029
LEAVING?

209
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,559
THERE ARE FOUR REASONS
WHY.

210
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:04,730
TO THE CREDIT OF THE

211
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,470
MAINSTREAM PRESS, THEY DON'T
REALLY GIVE A LOT OF TIME TO THE

212
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,160
FAMILY REASON, THEY ALSO IGNORE
THAT, THEY DON'T DISMISS IT LIKE

213
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,329
I DO, BUT THEY IGNORE IT.

214
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:15,129
NUMBER
FOUR IS THE ONE THEY TALK ABOUT

215
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:17,519
THE MOST, THIS CIVIL WAR WITHIN
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,

216
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,160
CONSERVATIVES PRESSURING HIM,
FRUSTRATING HIM, THE FREEDOM

217
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,699
CAUCUS, IT'S A TOUGH JOB AND WHO
WOULD REALLY WANT THIS JOB?

218
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:28,699
GO

219
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:30,529
READ ANY ARTICLE IN THE
MAINSTREAM PRESS, THEY SPEND 80%

220
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,579
OF THEIR TIME TALKING ABOUT
THAT.

221
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:33,579
THAT IS NOT THE REAL

222
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,420
ISSUE, THAT IS ABOUT 2% OF HIS
CONSIDERATION.

223
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,420
ALL THESE THINGS

224
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,490
ARE TOUGH JOB STOPPING
POLITICIANS LOVE POWER.

225
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,490
THEY

226
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,649
AREN'T LIKE, GOLLY GEE, I'VE
BEEN PRESSED A LITTLE BIT, THIS

227
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,079
IS A TOUGH JOB, I HAVE TO GO.

228
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,199
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

229
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,199
IT'S

230
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:50,589
NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT A
CONSIDERATION BUT IT'S A TINY

231
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:51,589
CONSIDERATION.

232
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:52,949
THAT'S REASON
NUMBER FOUR.

233
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:53,949
REASON NUMBER THREE

234
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:54,949
IS CASHING IN.

235
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:57,579
YOU THINK THAT
MIGHT BE REASON NUMBER ONE, BUT

236
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,180
HE'S ONLY 48, HE'S GOT A LOT OF
YEARS TO CASH IN. AND THESE GUYS

237
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,079
HAVE TROUBLE LETTING GO OF
POWER.

238
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,350
BUT HE'S GOING TO LEAVE

239
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,489
AND HE'S GOING TO MAKE AN UNREAL
AMOUNT OF MONEY.

240
00:11:07,489 --> 00:11:08,489
SO WHEN HE

241
00:11:08,489 --> 00:11:09,829
TALKS ABOUT HIS FAMILY AND
TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY,

242
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:11,199
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT HE'S
TALKING ABOUT.

243
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:12,199
LIKE, I'M GOING

244
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:13,259
TO MAKE SO MUCH MONEY.

245
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:15,019
THE KIDS
ARE TEENAGERS, THEY ARE GOING TO

246
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,810
COLLEGE SOON, I'VE GOT TO MAKE
SOME SERIOUS MOOLAH HERE.

247
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,749
BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO GO
BACK INTO GOVERNMENT.

248
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,369
THIS IS A REVOLVING DOOR.

249
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:26,439
>>CENK, HE LITERALLY SAID TODAY
HE'S NOT GOING TO RUN AGAIN.

250
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:29,160
>>SURE, SURE.

251
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,589
>>SO YOU HAVE JUST BEEN PROVEN
WRONG, WE SHOULD HAVE BET.

252
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:36,000
>>OKAY, SO THERE ARE RUMORS ON
WHETHER HIS WANT TO CHALLENGE

253
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,740
MIKE PENCE FOR THE NOMINATION IN
2020 WHEN THEY ASSUME TRUMP

254
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:46,339
WON'T BE THERE ANYMORE, THOSE
ARE AMONG THE SPECULATIONS, SOME

255
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,610
SAY 2024, SOMETHING OTHER POSTS,
BUT WHAT DO YOU DO?

256
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,610
THIS IS THE

257
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,610
M.O.

258
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,649
OF ALMOST ALL POLITICIANS
ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE THE AGE

259
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:56,050
OF PAUL RYAN, YOU CASH IN AND
MAKE MILLIONS AND THEN YOU COME

260
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,649
BACK INTO GOVERNMENT, WORST CASE
SCENARIO IS A CABINET SECRETARY

261
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,819
OR SOMETHING, AND LIKE SCOTT
PRUITT YOU SAY THANK YOU TO THE

262
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:06,220
INDUSTRY THAT MAYBE ALL THIS
MONEY, AND I WILL DESTROY ALL

263
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,379
REGULATIONS OF IT.

264
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:15,040
REASON NUMBER
TWO IS HE DOESN'T WANT ANY PART

265
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,509
OF TRUMP, BECAUSE TRUMP IS GOING
TO PUT HIM IN AN IMPOSSIBLE

266
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:20,589
SITUATION.

267
00:12:20,589 --> 00:12:22,989
HE'S NOT GETTING OUT
BEFORE THE NEXT CONGRESS, AS HE

268
00:12:22,989 --> 00:12:26,209
STATED, HE'S GETTING OUT BEFORE
IMPEACHMENT.

269
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:27,209
THAT'S WHAT HE

270
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,209
THINKS, BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO
MAKE IT.

271
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:29,660
I THINK WHATEVER IS

272
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,899
WANT TO HAPPEN WITH TRUMP WILL
HAPPEN BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, AND

273
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:34,959
HENCE BEFORE HE RETIRES, SO
CHAFFETZ MADE THE RIGHT MOVE,

274
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,369
GET OUT RIGHT NOW.

275
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:39,440
IN FACT PAUL
RYAN, FUN PREDICTION, IF IT

276
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,589
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOOD TO HEAD
TOWARD IMPEACHMENT AND A TOTAL

277
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,350
BLOWOUT, MIGHT PULL THE CHUTE
LIKE CHAFFETZ DID AND SAY I

278
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,970
MEANT AT THE END OF MY TERM, BUT
GOSH, TEENAGERS, GOTTA RUN.

279
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:55,570
SOMEONE JUST TURNED 13, I'VE GOT
TO GO.

280
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,980
BECAUSE IF THEY ARE GOING

281
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,389
TO DO IMPEACHMENT HE'S BETWEEN A
ROCK AND A HARD PLACE, HE SAID

282
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:04,740
ALL ALONG INCLUDING TODAY LET
MUELLER DO HIS JOB, THE RULE OF

283
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,009
LAW IN THIS COUNTRY IS
IMPORTANT.

284
00:13:07,009 --> 00:13:08,009
THERE'S A REPUBLICAN

285
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:10,899
CONGRESSMAN OFF THE RECORD
TALKING TO ERICK ERICKSON TODAY

286
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,960
ABOUT HOW WE ALL KNOW TRUMP IS
AN IDIOT AND WE WOULD IMPEACH

287
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,959
HIM IF HE COULD, IF IT COMES TO
IT, IF HE FIRES MUELLER.

288
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:18,959
NOW IF

289
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,709
YOU GO TO IMPEACHMENT, THE
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE ABOUT AS

290
00:13:21,709 --> 00:13:24,269
RELEVANT A HUMAN BEING AS THERE
IS ON THE PLANET.

291
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:25,269
SO THAT IF HE

292
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,899
BETRAYS TRUMP, THOSE REPUBLICAN
VOTERS THAT ARE THE BASE OF

293
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:31,579
TRUMP AND THE BASE OF THE NEW
REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL HATE HIM

294
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:35,779
FOREVER AND HE WILL NEVER GET
REELECTED TO ANYTHING AGAIN IF

295
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,350
HE GOES FOR IMPEACHMENT.

296
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,689
IF HE
DOESN'T GO FOR IMPEACHMENT,

297
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:42,899
THAT'S THE MOST CRAVEN,
RIDICULOUS THING IF TRUMP DID

298
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,379
ALMOST THINGS, ETC.

299
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:47,959
SO ALL OF
HIS -- EITHER YOU LOSE ANY KIND

300
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,120
OF SEMBLANCE OF BEING --

301
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,840
>>A SERIOUS PERSON.

302
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,820
>>A SERIOUS PERSON WHO CARES
ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND THE

303
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,279
CONSTITUTION, ETC., YOU ARE
SCREWED IF YOU ARE CAUGHT IN

304
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,279
THAT TRAP.

305
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,660
JESUS, THAT'S REASON
NUMBER TWO?

306
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
WHAT IS REASON

307
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,119
NUMBER ONE?

308
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,660
HE'S IN A DISTRICT
THAT'S ONLY +5 REPUBLICAN, THEY

309
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,519
JUST LOST A DISTRICT WHERE THEY
WERE +19, THEY LOST ANYWAY.

310
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,660
IN A

311
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,649
+5 DISTRICT IN WISCONSIN,
WISCONSIN, WHERE WE JUST HAD TWO

312
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:19,790
ENORMOUS UPSETS, ONE THAT THE
GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER SAID WAS A

313
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,420
HUGE RED FLAG FOR ALL
REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

314
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,929
AND ANOTHER ONE IN A JUDGE
VACANCY WHERE ANOTHER SHOCKING

315
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:31,579
VICTORY, BIG VICTORY FOR
PROGRESSIVES, WISCONSIN IS GOING

316
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,420
BLUE WAVE BIG TIME.

317
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,550
SCOTT
WALKER, THE GOVERNOR, IS LIKE,

318
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,850
HELP, I NEED MORE MONEY, WE'RE
DYING OUT HERE.

319
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,850
FRANK LUNTZ, THE

320
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,329
TOP REPUBLICAN POLLSTER, SAYS
YOU DON'T GET IT, IT'S A

321
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:48,910
TSUNAMI, THE HOUSE AND THE
SENATE ARE GOING.

322
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,910
WHETHER YOU

323
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,779
BELIEVE THAT OR NOT, JOHN,
THAT'S WHAT THE TOP REPUBLICAN

324
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,139
POSTERS ARE SAYING, THAT'S WHAT
ALL THE POLLS SAY.

325
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:55,139
THAT'S WHAT

326
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,949
SABADO IS SAYING.

327
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,829
>>ANTONIO SABATO, JR.?

328
00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:03,119
>>NO.

329
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:08,540
IF YOU ARE IN A +5
DISTRICT AND YOUR OPPONENT,

330
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,689
RANDY BRYCE, HAS RAISED 2
MILLION IN JUST THE LAST

331
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:18,259
QUARTER, AND SMALL DONATIONS,
HE'S A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT, HE

332
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:22,829
DOESN'T TAKE CORPORATE PAC
MONEY, RANDY BRYCE IS COMING

333
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,740
WITH A BLOWTORCH, YOU ARE IN A
+5 DISTRICT.

334
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,740
IF YOU AS THE

335
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,279
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE LOSE YOUR
OWN SEAT YOU ARE HUMILIATED.

336
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,279
IT

337
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,439
WOULD BE LITERALLY AN
UNPRECEDENTED LOSS.

338
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:36,439
IT WOULD BE

339
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:37,639
A HISTORIC LOSS.

340
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,639
AND RIGHT NOW
--

341
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,639
>>DASCHLE?

342
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,720
>>THAT WAS THE SENATE, BUT A
DASCHLE-LIKE LOSS, THAT'S RIGHT.

343
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,149
SO RIGHT NOW HE'S LOOKING AT THE
PRECIPICE, HE'S GOT TO GO.

344
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,149
ARE

345
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,149
YOU INSANE?

346
00:15:51,149 --> 00:15:53,120
WHY ARE WE HAVING A
CONVERSATION ABOUT REPUBLICAN

347
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,499
CIVIL WARS AND FAMILIES AND ALL
THAT NONSENSE?

348
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:56,939
HE HAS TO LEAVE

349
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:03,689
BECAUSE HE HAS AT MINIMUM OF 50%
CHANCE OF BEING HUMILIATED AND

350
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:06,279
RUN OUT OF TOWN, TARRED AND
FEATHERED.

351
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,279
THAT'S WHY HE'S

352
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,670
RESIGNING.

353
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,589
AND BY THE WAY, RANDY
BRYCE HAS A LOT OF SUPPORTERS

354
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,489
AND A LOT OF HEALTH, A LOT OF
GROUPS BACKING HIM, GREAT,

355
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:19,799
STRONG PROGRESSIVE GROUPS, ETC.,
AND HE'S ALSO JUSTICE DEMOCRAT.

356
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:22,990
SO I'M NOT SAYING JUSTICE
DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO

357
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,779
GET CREDIT, NOT REMOTELY.

358
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,029
ALL
THOSE GROUPS SHOULD GET CREDIT

359
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:28,989
FOR ALL THE HELP THEY HAVE
GIVEN, PCCC, ETC., TO RANDY

360
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:30,089
BRYCE.

361
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:33,829
BUT I REMEMBER WHEN
JUSTICE DEMOCRATS STARTED, THE

362
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:37,070
IDEA THAT THEY WOULD EVEN GET
ONE DEMOCRAT IN CONGRESS WAS

363
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,350
FUNNY.

364
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,299
DEEPLY PROGRESSIVE
CANDIDATES WHO DON'T TAKE ANY

365
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:45,389
CORPORATE PAC MONEY?

366
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,149
MAYBE YOU
WILL GET ONE BY ACCIDENT.

367
00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:50,449
IT

368
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,339
LOOKS LIKE A JUSTICE DEMOCRAT
BACKED CANDIDATE IS ABOUT TO

369
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:56,870
TAKE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE'S
JOB.

370
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,149
WHAT NOW?

371
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:00,149
BY THE WAY, WE

372
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,420
WILL HAVE THE LINKS DOWN BELOW
TO HELP RANDY BRYCE TAKE THAT

373
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,130
SEAT, DON'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR
GRANTED, AND LINKS TO

374
00:17:05,130 --> 00:00:00,000
JUSTICE DEMOCRATS AS WELL.
