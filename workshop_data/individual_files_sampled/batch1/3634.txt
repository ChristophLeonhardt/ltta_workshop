so my name is Luke Harding I'm a journalist and a writer and my new book is called collusion and it's about Donald Trump and Russia Putin saying that the collapse of Soviet Union is the world's sort of greatest geopolitical catastrophe it's a famous quote and essentially I think it's important because Putin is a KGB guy deep down he sees the world in conspiratorial terms there's a phrase for it that they they teacher at KGB spy school which is globally pretty bleak the main adversary and the main adversary is America both in the 60s 70s and 80s and also now in Putin's head that he sees international politics and diplomacy is a zero-sum game in which what's bad for America is good for Russia and actually he's had a pretty good run recently he invaded Ukraine he staged military kind of intervention in Syria and obviously he hacked the u.s. election to help Donald Trump who I think to Putin's surprise became president if a Putin lying is is something he does all the time and there's nothing shameful about it it's he views lying as a kind of operational tactic and again it's something you learned about its spy school you live for strategic reasons but what's astonishing is that the dahle Trump seemingly believes Vladimir Putin the KGB officer over all 30 in the US intelligence agencies who unanimously say that Russia hide the elation now I'm a not a psychologist I mean I thought I can't explain what's going on and all Trump's head but but clearly Putin is lying and and for Trump to kind of believe him or at least to say he believes his isn't it is an astonishing sign of where we now are I think he intends to carry on forever there's a Russian election next year in 2018 but but it's like an election it's not an election it's essentially decorative I think we all know who's going to win it which means they have no six-year term taking him until 2024 and the logic of this sort of corrupt system in Russia is the eating has to carry on forever and so I can see Putin outlasting Trump and I think he is going to be a kind of formidable for politicians not just now but also in the future
