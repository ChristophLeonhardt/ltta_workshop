evidence to call you before the call it's this statement that has changed what is happening today I'll read it is safer to you I see the little journalist this is a bit a lot of psychosis there with me share this sharing white proceedings and the court has served me with two allegations of continuous this is one more than 300 this is one more than one face at the Crown Court of Leeds in relation to the first allegation breaching the order of the call which requires as I understand an intention to interfere with the administration of justice I would like to say this firstly would like to assure the core that undermining the core Safari or interfering with the administration of justice was never my intention I believe the acted in good faith within the parameters of the section or reporting restriction embrace information I provided was in the public domain they respect you and Ray LaHood but did not provide any feet the trolls proceedings already been reported previously documents in my condo as examples of what had previously been reported that leaves from cool mahogany you're going to actually bring this when you buy when I arrived for these trample that morning I could not tell you any specific details of the report and restriction order I do not believe there is a website which holds such details so I researched online and I reviewed the reporting restriction guidelines provided they say that the portion include details of reporting restrictions on the call these scenes both online and in poor and also provided no is for the door of record my solicitors have photographic evidence to show you that the court did not follow these guidelines that they there were no detailed listing anywhere of a rapport restriction for this case this is also in the bundle the only time the magnification about reporting restrictions was available was later the afternoon after the court had convicted me and send me to prison and the restriction against the court this is the boat grooming pace he Islamic rated you had pace and was subsequent thanks oh my previous experience with content of call in Calabrese to ensure I would not feel found or found at the Laura game or a privately paid for training with one elite let London's leaving North Road pingzhi Napoli to cover all details of guard in contempt of court there is a documentation in relation to this in my bundle for the lead grand Paul I had knowledge of the verdict of the first phase of the trial I knew many of the specific details discussing call for this particular trial I did not talk about these in my livestream on that day I had understood based on my training there are specifics of the case and the verdicts were off limits for reporting restrictions drink having a drink Thanks having been unable to obtain any details from the core on the conditions of the reported restriction I decided to review the guidelines for reporting restrictions all the judiciary's website there is a practical guide and the touches and the media of the statutory and common law principles should be acquired irregardless reporting restrictions this paper was called reporting restrictions in the criminal course act in his paper each state's the court have no power under Section four two of the content of court act to prevent publication of material already see 8:27 at this document I follow my training and this guidance to the letter I did not divulge any of the previous case verdict I did not detail any specifics mentioned in the trial I did not shoot kill I refrain from entering court puppy I even asked the office also I call where the court boundaries were and was i okay to film which he replied confirmed I was I also call it the guidance document issued on the judiciary website in for me and for me means I can only reference information that was already in the public domain every single thing I said that they was in the public domain I actually read the charges and the names of the defendants from a BBC news article which to this day is still live on their website I also made sure not to film anyone other than the defendant I was calm and respectful it's my understanding that there is no individual in the last 60 years that have been sentenced to prison for a publication breach of a report in order it would appear my punishment is exceptional I would ask I'm treated in the same manner as every other journalist who's been charged with these allegations the journalist scott-little was writing for The Spectator magazine in relation to the Stephen Lawrence murder trial when he was sentenced for breach in a section for order and risk him prejudice to the trial he was given a fine journalist at the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror published highly prejudicial material on the trial of Levi Bellfield who ducked it and murdered an 11 year old child this content of call led to the collapse of the entire place and the discharge of the jury it brought one of the victims of the chance of justice the reporters in this instance were not prosecuted instead their employers were found guilty of content and 510 thousand pounds the Daily Mirror have run in peace of the hippies of the he peace against me for this crime but they have committed for mercy I approve the court transcripts from Leeds Crown Court where the judge was discussing various report in order breaches the judge and the CPS discussed the fact the multiple news sources reached the very same award pay for my trial and some breach of both reported orders by mentioning the crewmen TRO as well as fire risks and prison term this occasion the home oh hello this is somewhere the horrible piece of page correspondent at the indicated actually refused to remove her article when provided with the order stay in that the effect of social media or each report restrictions to see yes and the judge agreed that these breaches of the order were matter for the Attorney General to review when I was informed of the blanket order I offer to delete my video immediately despite the multiple breaches of the order by different newspapers that we came and the flatter refusal were Lizzie didn't to take her Arkell down not one of these journalists all the edges of those publications have ever been arrested or prosecuted for breaching sexual or two of the contempt of court act according according to the court transcripts the newspaper breaches of the reported order was a matter literally general my case was not referred to the Attorney General for review in state I was hoping to court immediately refuge my own choice of legal representation prosecuted and convicted in a matter of minutes in all the Court of Appeal regarded as a flawed trial I was then imprisoned by over two and a half months in solitary confinement till I won the appeal I was having against with accusation moved to the highest Muslim population Katzie prison umbria subjected to mental torture and constant threats abuse had all of my whites removed in the interest of prison safety it is free to me than my continued persecution and heavy-handed tactics from mistake is because of who I am rather than what I did in relation to the second allegation the strength liability allegation I would like to say this it is only since my original trial that there has been an additional charge habits suggesting that the contents of my live stream were prejudicial to this case the cows have bring it the jury concluded and the verdicts were given I would like to state clearly they in the transcripts from the original trial the judge to stop my video with mr. Roy QC prosecution counsel having reviewed the entire content of my video mr. Roy stated in court I'll quote there is nothing they could have seen that could in any way prejudice them against the defendants judge Mawson agrees on the record in court for this reason I cannot see why I should face two charges when the core of the allegation in front of Judge Marcin was the breach of a section for to order AHA because I regard it as a political activist and the charges are motivated by my political activism I do not accept that the material was live-streamed creates even real or subjects of those who wish the prejudice to the least resilience the prosecution capsule and the judge both agreed on the court transcripts the Malloy stream could not have prejudice that your in fact sorry we don't need the media to report that because we everything everything pogrom everything horrible in the morning was fair and accurate published in good faith within the constraints of the judiciary's guidelines for the media I will address each point in the allegations drafted by the Advocate of the core the first allegation is that I suggested the defendants were involved in war criminal activity this is not correct I was referring to two reports one on the radio and one in the huntzberger examinar which sell the allegations related to the twenty nine individuals the second allegation is that stay in the pose of the same efficacy of religion as the defendants were disproportionately likely to commit the crimes for which the defendant were being tried could prejudice the trial this statement is factually correct the quillion foundation her muslim run antique streamers and think-tank have produced a research paper looking at commissions at these street grooming from 2005 to 2007 tea this is in the defense fundal they found 84% of all convictions but south asian with the significant majority oppose the in pakistani the white children salty target the home secretary himself announced on BBC news this year they least hit types of street grooming the individuals convicted or from a disproportionately Pakistani background nothing nothing absol is the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the northwest of England he's a lead prosecutor on child sexual abuse and he also publicly stated on channel folders the Asians Muslims and Pakistanis in particular are disproportionately involved in this type of street grooming he also presented these facts in front of POD I merely say it factual insight into the ethnicity and the religious makeup of the perpetrators of these crimes I repeated publicly available research papers from the quillion organization testimony from the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the northwest and a statement from our home secretary himself all three of which are in fact Pakistani Muslims themselves I do not accept that reporting facts on the ethnicity or the makeup of a particular offender group could be categorized as contempt of court given the number of grooming trials coming in progress across our country and the commentary on those facts which are widely discussed online and in the media the third allegation of voices go the third allegation is the highlighting as significant the sexual references of the abuse I elicit from the defendants could prejudice the trial IR features of the pendants what their views were on the verdict they were expecting that day all three of them separately made aggressive vulgar sexual references or sexual threats against both my mother and my wife Oh a beanie looks a lot also dependent to coming on their fuse or my wife or my mother they did this out of the blue repeating what the action set in the video has no relevance or prejudice on this trial itself the full allegation the full allegation in Britain inner core is the I make derogatory comments about the religious background of the defendants I would like to point out I was talking about I was not talking about specific defendant on trial I was referring to a reaction I have received my family and friends on previous convicted grieving games boy to Robert we comment appears to mean telling the truth that under Islamic law the age of consent come inside for puberty in Islam there is no set age for marriage the Islamic false prophet Muhammad who is said to serve as a role model for every Muslim is reported by sunny hadith sources to America Ayesha when she was six and raped her when she by age 56 years old is tiny the prosecution may not like to hear the truth but there is no way than me sharing the truth and facts about a particular religion from social media can lead to prejudice on a trial in relation to the fifth allegation a number of comments revived over made by other people by comments related to proven trolls generally across the country revival in this particular case eg shamed page 8 of the transcripts at the live stream relate to robbery lobsters I made it clear from my video that the trial concerns allegations I make it clear that the defendants we're innocent until proven guilty the nature the nature and the number of these ongoing soils prosecution's and investigations is highly alarming I believe is in the public's interest to hear the details and know of the complexities and the connections amongst the previous prosecution's the future safety of vulnerable children at risk is my concern here not the perceived prejudice towards the defenders if twenty nine Christian priests were on trial on such charges with reporting restrictions I would feel exactly the same when when I initially went to can't recall I did sorry wife there was the public's interests the police have DNA evidence on all four of the now convicted child babies yet the decision was made to grant these individuals fail they were still they were still running the same take race off and coming into contact with young school children rather than the defendants absconded to Afghanistan we've DNA evidence on each now convicted child rapist is my belief that they should have been remanded to prison until Oh Joe Vitale instead a decision was made to release these pedophiles back into the community on bail the same Ranger was placed with the children in case in question but now convicted child gang rape is on trial in Leeds that they were also free to walk on the streets of mail there were 18 different witness statements detailing the rape and the torture of those children yet the justice system to side it that they did not pose a risk to the British public and granted then bail just like the colibri case one of these child rapists in Leeds also absconded before his verdict was reached right for me his plane to Pakistan and according to the court transcripts he was last seen leaving his house with a large bag that is a convicted child rapist free to roam the streets estate loan this to the public and judge Larson granted him bail to to to the reporting restrictions on the case for the last five months neither the British public have been allowed to be made aware that this man is on the run where when when the reporting restrictions were lifted how many national newspapers or news agencies have run with a picture of this man saying three previously been charged with a non-violent offense I was reminded straight to prison to await oil leadscrew court in May this year the police whiskey from the streets almost subjected to a fundamentally flawed trial and then I was sent straight to prison moving five hours this is all was the very same system allows alleged child rapist with multiple prosecution witness statements and even DNA evidence implicating them to the crime to continue to walk our streets the court has a duty to the victims and to the public to protect them and telling them could help sort on going child sex reputation and maybe prevent future wonderful children from falling victim to it okay I would like to reiterate that undermining the judge that caught all the proceedings and the supremacy of the law of the administration of justice was never my intention for I truly believed that there are poor restriction on this trial and subsequent connected trials are detrimental to the public and should never be not happening imposed so the public believe the details and tourists the jurors are given a responsibility they are aware of the consequences of researching the cases they still are it should be upon them and we should trust them to the retirement policy and integrity it should not be for the priests company to be kept at the scene the dark just in case we do not the content this witness Nathan are true and to the best of my knowledge and my belief we don't take any money from the corporate media we don't take any money from the government that leaves just you my friends if you support our crowdfunded journalism please do at Tommi trial calm you
