how many times has the president been to his own properties now that the Year is coming to a close well the answer is over a hundred according to a report from CNN Trump's Friday arrival at mar-a-lago on the heels of signing the tax bill he just left and went tomorrow it's 106 day he's visited one of his properties as a president a fact that critics argue helps the businessman turned politician boost the bottom line of the Trump Organization just a quick recap of all the plate all the days he spent how that breaks up we don't need to go to the graphics 34 days at mar-a-lago 40 days at Bedminster 23 times at the Trump International Hotel just blocks down the street from the White House at on Pennsylvania Avenue which is weird at fight he's been there five times during his presidency and then he also went to the Trump International Hotel in Waikiki this is this costs you know the tax payers not only an average of about three million dollars for every four days that he's away according to analysis of one Obama administration trip that he made but also it costs a lot of money toward local law enforcement 60,000 dollars in overtime per day according to CNN the cost to the local government for protecting him so a couple of notes here one is that stop that brett mentioned so on his way to asia trump stopped for no reason at all in hawaii so that he could go to Trump International Hotel Waikiki it's just on our dime a massive ad for his property I mean there's no reason to stop there but he did it obviously for marketing he's supposed to turn over all his properties when he's America because he's not supposed so when he's president he suppose served all of us right and he won't do it at a minimum you're supposed to put in a blind trust he's like I did well where is it it said my son like my son stress he's handling it well then it's not blind right you know where all your properties are that's what you're stopping at them and you know your kids are running it and and he said about the tax plan he's like it's so good I might go back into business you are in business what you're doing except you're doing on our dime but to me the numbers that really stand out is his hundred and six day it's it's been less than a year yeah it's been eleven months a hundred and six days on his own properties 80 days golfing and he had the temerity to criticize Obama for golfing too much I haven't golfed eighty days in my life okay and I like I like bitching but I like the 3par think it's fun I'd love to go I feel like I'm too busy to go on the weekends the President of the United States is going let's got eighty times in 11 months that's unbelievable to me where have you been a hundred times wherever where have you spent a hundred days this year like I can't think I got a gym membership like I'm going all the time forty like that's super max this year there's where have I've been here a hundred times and I've been to my house a hundred times that's it well and his look the Trump hypocrisy is now I mean it's just it's almost mythological the way he was banging on Obama about as Genk says oh I've taken so much time golfing and that was this big this guy plays golf more than the pros you know and that of course Trump does that I was banging on Hillary about the email server and all that and then and whatever we find out everybody in here with everybody first of all conflict of interest he's surrounded by everybody who's there got one interest or another at the White House and they're all on private servers I mean sending government diamond so so this this cascade of a parody continues and he's an utter hypocrite but ultimately you get to the cost and that's what really pisses me off I mean we're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of our money and again from an administration that says don't we're gonna cut the we're gonna cut the waste and you know again he was saying that tune so it's hypocrisy on top of just profligate spending for to secure president who's just doing a big commercial for his own property that's what it is like I mean you can you can argument that argue that the Democrats don't care about the deficit now you can absolutely say the Republicans don't care about the deficit now it's down to how they spend the money they don't have and I just rather spend it on people who need it that's the difference all right and then one last thing is Trump is being sued by someone for the violating the emoluments clause which basically says it's illegal for you to give you you know use the government to give yourself profits to your own business that was dismissed recently because the plaintiffs in the case lacked standing not due to the merits of their arguments so it was like these people can't sue him but they didn't say you can't zoom because of that so keep an eye on that this guy's a parade of violating that clause right oh yeah yeah for another time he doesn't have Santa Claus he has a monuments class that's his favorite you just watch the video by the Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member
