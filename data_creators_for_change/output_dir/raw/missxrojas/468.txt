00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be</font>

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,330
entirely about books about some books

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recently read mainly for my</font>

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,480
classes at university actually all the

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,069
ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've been talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about today upper</font>

6
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:09,719
classes the first one is manhattan

7
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,700
transfer by john dos passos which i

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,320
thought was really well done it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,109
set in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City in kind of a span</font>

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,529
that starts around 1910 maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

11
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,029
bit earlier<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes</font>

12
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,340
on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> post-war</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's multiple narratives</font>

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,109
and sometimes it can get very confusing

14
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be honest even by the end I was it</font>

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,710
sure everyone was but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the narratives it</font>

16
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,630
does present like some of them are just

17
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">really touching some of them you kind of</font>

18
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,430
feel very shocked by really feel like

19
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,719
you're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being thrown into the</font>

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,340
city and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a really</font>

21
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,340
effective piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of writing I suppose so</font>

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's that secondly the story of</font>

23
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,250
Buddhism which I mentioned in an earlier

24
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,469
video was really really good i like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

25
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,090
it uses lots of case studies loads of

26
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,100
examples it really called you in it was

27
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,870
very clear accessible but you didn't

28
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,579
feel patronized by and highlighted a lot

29
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problems that we encounter when we</font>

30
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,210
study religion in general so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought</font>

31
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was a good read thirdly i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recently</font>

32
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,750
finished the pathfinder by James

33
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,890
Fenimore Cooper all 512 pages of it and

34
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,869
I really just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this book I didn't</font>

35
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:08,220
like any of the characters but I thought

36
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,600
was interesting how like the landscape

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,450
of America was presented but I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

38
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,189
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> so annoying it was so like typical</font>

39
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:17,340
oh this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hero he said great had no</font>

40
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,560
reason to see the Pathfinder as a hero

41
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,180
but I was being told that he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a hero</font>

42
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,409
and that is something that I really

43
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,659
dislike next one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Washington Irving's</font>

44
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sketchbook which I also mentioned in</font>

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,930
an earlier video it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> collection of</font>

46
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,640
short stories including Rip Van Winkle

47
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,200
and The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and it

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,579
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant and it has this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

49
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:34,590
nice kind of framing all of the stories

50
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,659
are found within papers of an old dead

51
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,430
guy given that whole kind of folk tale

52
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,439
and authentic atmosphere that it's just

53
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">really nice and I wouldn't say that it's</font>

54
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,079
a particularly hard we'd even though

55
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was written in the early 19th</font>

56
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,380
century so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you should give that</font>

57
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,909
short especially if you like short

58
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,320
stories the last book that I want to

59
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about today is kind of the central</font>

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,079
reason why I'm making this video I

61
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,850
literally finished reading it about 20

62
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes ago and it's titled the heart</font>

63
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">from understanding commentaries on the</font>

64
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,310
pressure parameter Heart Sutra by

65
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">ticknor ton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't pronounce it very</font>

66
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,140
well and I apologize and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's them for</font>

67
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,550
49 pages of commentaries on one of the

68
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,180
sutures from Buddhism<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

69
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,069
learn about vaguely if you read the

70
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,209
story of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Buddhism but then you learn</font>

71
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">about more if you take a class about the</font>

72
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,390
religions of asia which is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

73
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,250
doing and is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm reading these books</font>

74
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,069
finishing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cry but in a</font>

75
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:26,739
wonderful way he uses the Heart Sutra to

76
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:28,390
explain some of the ideas of emptiness

77
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,609
and of kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> interbeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

78
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,260
interconnectedness and some of the ideas

79
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,359
that are kind of central to my

80
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,430
appreciation of their little bits that i

81
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,109
know of different aspects of different

82
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:40,989
schools of Buddhism it put me<font color="#CCCCCC"> in such a</font>

83
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:43,209
state of calm<font color="#CCCCCC"> and peace and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

84
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:44,709
strange for me because I'm a very

85
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:47,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">anxious person i think a lot i stress a</font>

86
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,879
lot as you all know it<font color="#CCCCCC"> writings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

87
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,919
clear and it is written for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Western</font>

88
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:53,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">audience as well so with an awareness of</font>

89
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:55,060
the kind of things that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> grown up</font>

90
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,560
learning and growing up knowing so the

91
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,349
examples are clear to us and so i just

92
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:01,359
i'd like please read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it i mean it's it's</font>

93
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,239
49 pages long this was ten dollars so

94
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,530
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for today the next books I'm</font>

95
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,419

96
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:09,639

97
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,319
reading to do so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stop this</font>
