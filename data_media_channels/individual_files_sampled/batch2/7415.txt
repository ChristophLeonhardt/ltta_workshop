yesterday we reported on UN Ambassador nikki Haley and Donald Trump who both made comments threatening to potentially pull funding from countries that participate in an upcoming vote as of yesterday that was going to happen inside of the United Nations that would condemn the us's decision to move its embassy to Jerusalem which is obviously very controversial and they did it and there has been violence as a result of it people have lost their lives and there are significant concerns about the effect on the long term push for peace in that region as a result of it well now that vote has actually happened despite the threats and here's the final result it was 128 to 9 voting to condemn the u.s. for that move with 35 countries abstaining now the nine who voted against the resolution we have the US and Israel I mean if you were betting on that you should have been but also Guatemala Honduras the Marshall Islands Micronesia Nauru Palau and Togo well the great island nation of Togo what have you done yes well look every nation gets to vote it's the UN but it is interesting that that they have decided to go with the US now there were a lot of abstentions and that's questionable as well especially considering the fact that with the threats to pull the funding a lot of people are paying attention to this there can be a certain maybe cowardliness to not die deciding to vote in the end but what's interesting is one of the countries in that abstaining category is Canada and it was reported by Barack Rafat earlier today that Canada had considered voting against the resolution but changed the vote to abstention after hearing Trump's threats in order not to be perceived as a u.s. puppet according to diplomats who were briefed on the matter and so it did seem to have an effect to these threats but perhaps not the effect that they intended well that's exactly what we talked about on the show yesterday I mean now you if you cave in to Trump's overt threats you look like a lap dog you look like Tony Blair or worse going along with the Iraq war so it puts our allies in a tough position even if they were going to agree with us yeah and and they have enough sense not to and as we talked about yesterday on the show too sometimes your allies are our try our in a case like this voting against you not because they don't like you not because they're against you but because they're trying to help you say this is a bad idea it's gonna destabilize the Middle East it's not gonna help Israel it's not gonna help yourself and and so Canada did the right thing and and so did 128 other countries yeah and so we're now perceived as a bullies of the world and it's not even working yeah well let's see if this messaging helps so nikki Haley spoke at the UN before the vote but probably had a pretty good idea of how it was going to go and here is a small section of what she said - its shame the United Nations has long been a hostile place for the State of Israel both the current and the previous Secretary General's have objected to the UN's disproportionate focus on Israel it's a wrong that undermines the credibility of this institution I've often wondered why in the face of such hostility Israel has chosen to remain a member of this body and then I remember that Israel has chosen to remain in this institution because it's important to stand up for yourself Israel must stand up for its own survival as a nation but it also stands up for the ideals of freedom and human dignity that the United Nations is supposed to be about that speech was disgusting and and look I want there to be two states I want Israel to be free and independent and an and a great Ally and all those wonderful things but you cannot go out there and say with a straight face that Israel stands for the values of freedom while you are occupying the Palestinians for decade after decade after decade and you have no plan to ever let them go so it's not a quitting it seemed like just randomly randomly the entire world decided that Israel was wrong about this and just just how to correct being capricious or something no there's a reason because you're not legally allowed to occupy those people you're not I'm go let him go if you care about Israel you love Israel stop putting it in a situation where it does not have the moral high ground where it seems like it is it has captured those people and is never going to let them go for God's sake to a two-state solution so but for America to come up there and do a disingenuous speech about how Norway and org Y and Kenya or some have decided that they're gonna suppress Israel's freedom what what's being suppressed Israel is allowed to be Israel Israel's got everything it's got power it's got weapons it's got the u.s. behind it the biggest military ever created in the history of the world it's the Palestinians that are it makes it if you listen making Haley speech you think that Palestinians were occupying the Israelis mm-hmm it's the other way around let him go let him go let him go if you care about Israel and you care about doing the right thing and you and living in peace for God's sake you've got to let him go peace deals work Carter did a peace deal between Israel and Gyptians the right wing laughed at it they said I don't I'll never work it did work they haven't done a war in all those years and all those decades peace does work the right wing doesn't want peace not because it cares about Israel or America but because fear drives people to vote for right-wingers and if you have peace well that it's harder to make people afraid and it's also monetarily very good for some people yeah yeah we're not gonna play more of a commentary but it went on like that for quite a while and she made clear that I mean she seemed to know the vote was not going to go her way since we all did but said that this vote won't change the decision the embassy change will happen although not immediately and that the US will remember those who voted against them and disrespected them she specifically said well wow the bully was disrespected are you okay you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
