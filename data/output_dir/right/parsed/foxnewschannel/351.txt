THING.
THANK YOU, JONATHAN.
WELL, SOME HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES
ARE LEADING THE RESISTANCE,
THERE ARE A HANDFUL IN
TINSELTOWN SUPPORTING THE
NOMINATION AND THE PRESIDENT WHO
MADE IT.
CHRISTY SWANSON HAS BEEN BUSY ON
THE BIG AND SMALL SCREEN.
POLITICS GETTING IT A TENSION.
CHRISTY JOINS US LIVE, WELCOME.
>> HELLO, SHANNON.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
>> Shannon: LISTEN, YOU KNOW,
YOU GET HEAT FOR WHAT YOU ARE
DOING.
I WANT TO READ ONE OF YOUR
TWEETS FROM AUGUST.
YOU SAID WOMEN HAVE ALL THE
POWER.
WE DECIDE EVERYTHING.
WHEN TO EAT DINNER, HAVE SOUTH
CAROLINA, GET MARRIED, WHEN TO
HAVE BABIES, GO TO SCHOOL, PLAY
SPORTS, EVEN FOR POTUS.
WHAT’S WITH THE VICTIM TRAIN,
#WOMENHAVEITALL.
WHAT KIND OF REACTION DID YOU
GET?
>> I GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT AND
YOU KNOW, I GOT A LOT OF
BACKLASH FOR IT.
MY WHOLE POINT OF THAT TWEET, IS
DON’T VICTIMIZE.
LIKE, BE STRONG.
BE POWERFUL.
YOU AREN’T -- I HAVE A HARD TIME
UNDERSTANDING ALL OF THESE
PROTESTS BY WOMEN AND THE
MARCHS.
AND I JUST DON’T GET IT.
WE ARE POWERFUL AND WE ARE
STRONG.
AND WE JUST NODE TO STICK TO
THAT.
I DON’T KNOW, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE
IT’S GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.
>> Shannon: YOU HAVE BEEN
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PRESIDENT
BEFORE HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, SUPPORTIVE OF JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, TALKED ABOUT PRAYING
FOR HIS FAMILY.
YOU ARE IN A UNIQUE SITUATION,
YOU ARE A SOUTH CAROLINA ASSAULT
YOU ARE OPEN ABOUT THE FACT THAT
YOU ARE A SOUTH CAROLINA ASSAULTSURVIVE OR, MORE THAN ONCE -- A
SURVIVE OR, MORE THAN ONCE -- A
SEX ASSAULT SURVIVOR.
HOW DO YOU LOOK AT BOTH SIDES OF
THIS AS IT’S BEEN PLAYING OUT?
>> IT’S REALLY HIT HOME FOR ME.
BEING ON BOTH SIDES,
EXPERIENCING BOTH THINGS, BEING
A CHILD AND AS A TEENAGER.
A SURVIVE OR OF SEXUAL ABUSE AS
IT’S BROUGHT UP A LOT OF
EMOTIONS, ALL OF THIS STUFF.
AND HIM BEING ACCUSED AND THE
STORY FULL OF HOLES.
IT DOESN’T MAKE ANY SENSE.
I’M JUST, I’VE BEEN PULLING FOR
HIM BECAUSE THIS WHOLE STORY WAS
I’M JUST, I’VE BEEN PULLING FOR
HIM BECAUSE THIS WHOLE STORY WAS
JUST, IT’S JUST FABRICATED.
NOTHING, NOTHING ABOUT IT MAKES
ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.
>> Shannon: DO YOU THINK BECAUSE
ARE YOU A SURVIVOR YOURSELF,
THAT DR. FORD WAS CREDIBLE?
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK SHE
SUFFERED A TRAUMA, WHAT THEY
DON’T AGREE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT
CLEARLY SHE SEEMS A BIT FRAGILE
AND HAS SUFFERED SOMETHING.
>> IT’S, LOOK, I WILL SAY IT’S
VERY POSSIBLE THAT SOMETHING HAS
HAPPENED TO HER IN HER LIFE.
VERY POSSIBLE.
BUT IT’S NOT BRETT KAVANAUGH.
THAT’S NOT THE STORY.
BUT I DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER.
I MEAN, ARE WE EVER GOING TO
KNOW.
NONE OF HER STORY COMES
TOGETHER, WHATSOEVER.
AND, YOU KNOW, BEING SURVIVOR
MYSELF, MY SITUATION WAS 1984,
AND I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.
I MEAN EVERYTHING.
THERE’S NOTHING THAT I DON’T
REMEMBER.
>> Shannon: LET ME ASK YOU THIS
AS WE WRAP UP, DOES IT BOTHER
YOU THE BACKLASH THAT YOU GET IN
L.A., OR ON TWITTER, OR DO YOU
RELISH THE CHANCE TO ENGAGE
PEOPLE WHO DON’T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU FEEL THE WAY YOU DO?
>> I GOT TO BE ME, YOU KNOW.
I’VE BEEN CONSERVATIVE MY ENTIRE
LIFE.
I’VE KEPT QUIET IN HOLLYWOOD
OVER THE YEARS, KEEP TO MYSELF
ABOUT IT.
BUT I’M A MOM, I’M STILL AN
ACTRESS, AND RAISING A CHILD,
AND I’VE GOT TO BE MYSELF.
I’VE GOT TO STAND UP FOR WHAT I
BELIEVE IN.
THAT’S WHAT I’M DOING.
IF I GET BACKLASH, SO BE IT.
BUT I GOT TO BE ME.
>> Shannon: GOOD ADVICE FOR ALL
OF US.
AND WE WISH YOU THE BEST.
I KNOW FOR MANY, MANY WOMEN AND
MEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS HAS
I KNOW FOR MANY, MANY WOMEN AND
MEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS HAS BROUGHT UP A LOT FOR THEM, IT’S
BROUGHT UP A LOT FOR THEM, IT’S
