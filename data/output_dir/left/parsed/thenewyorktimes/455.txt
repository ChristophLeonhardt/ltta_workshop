Here at the Torkham Border Crossing,
hundreds of thousands of
Afghan refugees have been
returning to their home country.
50-year-old Shah Jahan is one of them.
He’s lived near Peshawar, in Pakistan
for 35 years, where he worked
as a daily laborer and raised a family
of 10 children. With them, he’s now
returning to Kabul, the Afghan capital.
More than two million Afghans have
been living in Pakistan for decades.
The majority fled during the
Soviet-Afghan war of the 1980s.
The Pakistani government is now
pushing them to return to Afghanistan.
Jahan registers his family for
assistance and gets emergency supplies
from the International Organization for
Migration. Like many recent Afghan returnees,
Jahan and his family never formally
registered in Pakistan, and so are
ineligible for the $200 per person UNHCR
cash grant afforded to those who were.
Instead, they’re given $30 per person
to cover transportation costs to Kabul.
Shah Jahan and his family then board
this rented truck with their belongings.
They carry the donated supplies — large
sacks of flour, tarpaulins, cooking oil,
blankets and pots and pans — to the truck.
He returns to an increasingly
unstable Afghanistan.
On this route, they pass through miles
of territory which Afghan security forces
and the Taliban fight over on
an almost daily basis.
The Islamic State is also active in
the area, and one week after
Jahan’s journey, the U.S. dropped
the so-called “mother of all bombs”
on one of their hideouts about
10 miles south.
With the country's unemployment rate as
high as 40 percent, the family’s
prospects for financial
security are bleak.
The returnees stop at
one point for lunch.
From there, they press on to
the west for their final destination,
where Jahan plans to rent a house.
He hopes to one day return to
his home village in the province of
Paktia, and build a house of his own.
