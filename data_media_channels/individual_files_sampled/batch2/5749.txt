take on this breaking news right now the White House is just announcing just announcing that it is official they do in fact plan to pardon scooter libby Kelly O'Donnell standing by for us there on the lawn of the White House Kelly Oprah folks who haven't been following this necessarily as closely as all of us who were scooted who was scooter libby why is this significant scooter libby was the chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney in the Bush administration and he was convicted of a handful of counts related to not telling the truth to investigators and the grand jury related to the leak of the name of an FBI officer Valerie Plame who has been now well known over the last several years today the president has issued a full pardon he says that I don't know mr. Libby but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly hopefully this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life at issue one of the witnesses in the case Judith Miller who had previously worked for the New York Times had given testimony about learning the name of Valerie Plame Wilson she was married to the ambassador at the time who had been critical of the Iraq war that that conversation between a source Scooter Libby and the reporter that that she recanted that saying that she had given inaccurate information about Libby being a source with respect to the leak of a CIA officer's name this was a huge crisis during the Bush administration it led to the appointment of a special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald the person who appointed that prosecutor was none other than James Comey who we have all been living through the drama of his time as FBI director fired by this president conservatives have long felt that Libby's crimes happened after the special prosecutor had known that it was a different official a State Department official who had first disclosed the name to a columnist but the investigation continued and in the course of that investigation Libby maintained that it was a conflict of memories between himself and other witnesses who contradicted his testimony and therefore the argument conservatives have made is that the scope of what the special Secutor was doing went beyond who identified his classified individual valerie plame to catching libby in lies now the jury reviewed all that information they found that Libby did in fact mislead and lie to the FBI and a grand jury President Bush not long after the conviction that was another day I ran to the camera with a piece of paper from the White House he commuted the sentence so stripping away from Libby the 30 month conviction prison time that he had but he kept the conviction in place saying that he didn't want to substitute his own judgment for that of a jury that had reviewed all the evidence and in the years since at the end of the Bush administration Vice President Cheney had implored President Bush to pardon Libby and it was a real point of contention between the two men as they left office that did not happen conservatives in the years since have raised money on behalf of Libby he lost his law license at the time it has since been reinstated but today President Trump grants a full pardon to Lewis Scooter Libby for the crimes he was convicted of in 2007 earlier and yes go ahead Craig Kelly in terms of timing what can we make of the timing why now and was was scooter libby lobbying the the president for this pardon through an intermediary because apparently not directly because according to the statement President Trump doesn't even know the guy well there is a process through the Department of Justice where anyone who is convicted and is seeking a pardon on federal crimes can file paperwork to be reviewed and you often find that in the case of we saw a lot of times when President Obama commuted or pardoned those who were convicted of drug crimes so those were not well-known individuals but there's a process by which you can seek an official pardon I'm told that that process had begun for Libby the timing however appears much more about a recent influence in the life of this President Joe digenova and Victoria tensing two lawyers here in Washington happen to be husband and wife tensing is currently scooter Libby's lawyer they have had the president's ear and were almost a part of the president's legal team one might just might expect that that case was brought to his attention because of their close in proximity to the president but it is a larger issue that conservatives have been complaining about for years believing that this was the scope of a special prosecutor going too far now of course those who believe the conviction was appropriate say that that is bunk but today this president who is living with a different kind of special counsel and a different kind of investigation he that he regularly claims is going too far you see the similarity perhaps the sensitivity from President Trump they cite here in the statement from the White House specific facts related to the Libby case that have been known in the public domain but it is hard to not see a little self reflection in the pardon the president Trump has signed for scooter living hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
