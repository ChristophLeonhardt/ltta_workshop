former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond is taking the Scottish government to court over its handling of - sexual harassment allegations which he strongly denies the claims date back to when he was first minister with one said to have taken place in the official Beauty House residence in Edinburgh the former SNP leader has asked the Court of Session to review the government's handling of the complaints process that procedure was changed on the advice of current First Minister Nicola Sturgeon these allegations came to light in January with Salmond informed about them in March the Scottish permanent secretary says the government will defend its position following the conclusion of an internal investigation I can confirm the Scottish government received two complaints in January in relation to Alex Salmond I note that the former minister has indicated his intention to challenge the actions taken by the Scottish Government his statement contains significant inaccuracies which will be addressed in those court proceedings the Scottish government would defend its position vigorously well joining me now for more is the man himself and examined mr. Sammon evening good evening you've dropped legal action against the Scottish government to stop them revealing details of the investigation why have you done that no that was because the Scottish government yesterday gave us two and a half hours notice that they were about to release a statement which would have brought the confidentiality of this whole process now these investigations depend on convened contain of confidentiality if you don't have that then how an f of people going to have the confidence to complain in future because it's not just about the person complained about it's the confidentiality of the complainants and the Scottish government wasn't breaking that confidentiality so we told them but to not make that statement because we were taking the action in the Court of Session but then of course somewhere from when the bowels of the Scottish government a tabloid newspaper was briefed so the story got out and therefore we revealed about a legal action and events have taken of course but it's an extraordinary situation when the Scottish government starts to break is on confidentiality after the shooting everybody connected with this that that was going to be absolutely protected throughout the process you say you're innocent of all these allegations why then should you not be concerned or are you concerned that the details of this investigation will be made public well the whole point about confidentiality is too low the process to be properly conducted and that's about the person who's who is on the receiving end and there and the people who've complained another point about it is of course just natural justice you know anything like this depends on having a fair show having a fair opportunity and I'm afraid the Scottish Government process doesn't do that you don't get to see the evidence you don't get to present your own case I was banned from speaking to any current civil servant many of whom incidentally have texted me today saying why didn't you come to us for to support your position well the reason is I was banned from doing that by Miss Leslie Evans the permanent secretary of the the Scottish government I wasn't allowed to contact them directly so if you can't present your own case you've got an unjust process but luckily in Scotland our highest court the Court of Session is available to go to and that's where I'm going to make sure we have a just process now if any good can come in at this whole thing then it will be that in future the process will be corrected so that it's both confidential as it's meant to be and just so that people can have confidence in it so if any good doesn't come out of this next stage going to the Court of Session what happens if you lose then of course I would have to to the to the complaints and answer them publicly and openly which I would do but of course if I win that judicial review then it means that the most serious questions are going to be asked in the very highest levels of Scottish government I'm not talking here about the politicians I'm talking about the permanent secretary miss Leslie Evans and the administration of Scottish government and how an F that could have got themselves into this situation this is a process that she herself devised there was only introduced has not been tested or tried and unfortunately it doesn't give people an opportunity to fairly state their case and most folk in Scotland and indeed elsewhere understand the point and principle of fairness are you trying to deflect from the details of the allegations by focusing on the process of this investigation as suggested by Nicola Sturgeon well I certainly hope that's not what Nicola Sturgeon was trying to suggest because nobody knows what the detail of the complaints are because haven't been published and certainly the lurid description brief from the Scottish Government to one tabloid newspaper that's not an accurate one how do you respond to the allegations how do you respond to this argument how do you respond to complaints I've refuted the complaints that were made against me and I absolutely deny any semblance of criminality so when you have such things you need a process which is both confidential and fair and most reasonable people will understand that and what I'm not frightened of going to the highest court in the land to establish that it seems the Scottish government looks a bit shaky in their position here's a little more of what your successor and former Protege Nicola Sturgeon had to say when complaints are received it is important that they are not swept under the carpet because of the identity the seniority or the political allegiance of the person being complained about as meek lead on many occasions that in all workplaces people must feel able to bring forward complaints and have confidence that they will be treated seriously and no it is important that due process and fair processes for so just to reiterate you're happy for an investigation as long as it's fair you surely accept that you shouldn't be treated differently and as Nicola Sturgeon was saying because we have seen high-profile politicians others being accused and investigated well I mean I always understand what's unique about the Scottish government processes of talking about events of many years ago I mean I'm not a serving Scottish government Minister I'm not even an MP and MSP at the present moment and therefore it's really important if you try and introduce such a retrospective procedure that you make sure that the person who is being complained about it has the opportunity to properly present the case I mean all all these civil servants who texted me today saying why didn't you come to us and ask us to support your position well I mean I wish I've been allowed to but these are basic tenants of national justice that have to be followed and the Scottish Government's been making the position look that should apply to everybody including former First Minister's I absolutely agree and everybody including former First Minister's and everybody in the land is entitled to a fair process and a chance to state their case fairly what could be wrong with that but now you know we as I say the only good that I can see coming out of this is we're on our way to the the Court of Session that's a real Court with real judgement with fair processes they'll make the decision and then we'll all have to obey but this is all happening five years on from the alleged incidents what do you make of the timing why is all this happening now do you think well I'm not gonna make any suggestions about motivations I I can't I can't establish but certainly I've been in pretty much the firing line for for quite some time and but I I don't know the motivation of of Lesley evans you'd have to ask her but it does seem quite extraordinary that she should have developed procedure which lacks the basic tenets of fairness there's also part of this process but we tried everything mediation conciliation we tried arbitration we offered arbitration to to get a High Court judge to look at the process and say how it could be made fair the Scottish government Leslie evidence said all when don't need that because we're confident for our position when people are confident in the position they don't resist arbitration they agreed to arbitration because they know the position will be upheld but we are where we are and where we are is going to the the Court of Session and if you go to the Court of Session in my opinion in Scotland with an argument for fairness and then that's a good expectation that the court recessional grant not of course you've been in the firing line from being a host hosting a TV show here on our tuk NRT so will you be stepping back from the limelight take a break wall well this is worked out no certainly no I'm going to the highest court allowed to establish my position to get me a fair process I think that's a perfectly reasonable thing to do it I'll be continuing to to perform as long as I'm wanted to perform which you know I expect will be some considerable time to come so you go on my life you get on my life I mean this has been hanging over maybe four five months now and it should have been a much more rapid a much more confidential and a much fairer process but that's what we'll get out the quarter session and I'll get on the life and I I wouldn't be I won't be dissuaded from making my opinions known just because I'm under fire in a number of ways just finally you're giving a very confident interview very confident appearance about you use strongly denial all these allegations saying they're patently ridiculous but but having them hanging over you just how do you cope on a daily basis and and what sort of impact could this have on your life in the future well I mean I've been in this for five months now and people people made I've got no incidentally animus against the complainants so they're perfectly entitled to complain but their expectation of my expectation should be a fear of confidential process but I believe for it for five months but then I've been in their own public life for more than thirty years I'm kind of used to the holiday ballet even if this is at the extreme end of it you gotta remember for there are people involved in us the I don't know the complainants families my family my friends hearing the news today which should be deeply upsetting for them so you know it does emphasize why fighting you're dealing with these highly sensitive matters you must have a process which is both confidential when you promise it to be and stays confidential those people can have confidence in it and it's also maybe not a Glee effect that's right however luckily for us the court recession will have the opportunity to establish that fear process which you know it will be good for the future if we get an improved situation when the Scottish government has a procedure for dealing with things that everybody can have confidence in Alex Salmond thank you very much indeed for your time you
