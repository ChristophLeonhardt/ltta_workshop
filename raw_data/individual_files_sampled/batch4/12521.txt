those of you who still follow world events through the mainstream media may find you're beginning to have some serious questions like why is that big head on my television screen lying to me all the time why is everything I know about the news completely untrue and how come I can't get a date but perhaps the most important question that is troubling followers of mainstream news is are the Russians good or bad if they're bad what's bad about them and if they're good why don't they speak English like normal people the history of Russia as told by the mainstream media is very complex in the old days Russia was good because they helped us defeat the Nazis who were bad which was good but then bad because then the Russians murdered millions of people and enslaved everybody which can't be good during the sixties the Russians were good because America was bad because America was fighting communism which was good which was bad the fighting I mean was bad because when America was fighting communism you could get sent to war and killed and that was bad because you were good then ronald reagan was elected and he was very bad because he was republican so when he said the Russians were bad they must have been good Reagan said the Russians were so bad that their country would collapse and all the smart people in the mainstream media said hahaha you stupid Reagan because they were good and he was bad and then the Russians country collapsed but not because of Reagan because he was bad now all the people who had said that Russia was good became college professors so they could teach young people that they were good and America was bad then the young people grew up and got jobs as journalists which was very bad George W Bush and Mitt Romney said the Russians were bad but they were Republicans so they were bad and the Russians were good then America was good because we elected Barack Obama who was good and he said the Russians were good so the Russians were good and we sent him a great big red reset button which wasn't bad until they pressed the button and Crimea disappeared which probably wasn't so good Barack Obama who was good said we should do business with Russia because they were good so Donald Trump's friends did business with them which was bad because Trump was bad when he said Russia was good she was bad but not like Reagan said it was bad because reagan was bad so he couldn't be good but russia was bad because Trump said it was good and he was that the important thing to remember is Republicans are bad so if they say Russia is good it's bad and Democrats are good so they if they say Russia is bad it's bad that's how the mainstream media television mr. collection and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right the clave endless

not sure if they're gonna pay me twice for that or just fire me i'm not sure anyway haha well if we're living in the aftermath of yesterday's speech and it I don't know if you watch the speech if you saw it toward the end if you watch Trump speech to the end all the Democrats got up and quickly ran out of the room you know and so here's the report as they report on what happened to the democrat party after the speech oh please bursting into flames and is falling I'm going that's all the fuss percentage that is terrible this is the one of the questions asked me to the world my feet into the sky it is is that the river great ladies Bill Burton spoken escapes out and the famous crazy to the ground nuts right to the mooring mast all the you met at it all the fence it wasn't a good day for the Democrats it was not a good day for the Democrats you know five years ago yesterday our friend Andrew Breitbart died and i'm gonna i want to talk about that but i want to talk about it in the context of what's happening with Trump and with the Breitbart sites and all of this history because now Breitbart has become this word it doesn't mean Andrew it means these sites that became one of the big under steve bannon's you know heading it became one of the big Pro Trump sites and probably helped him get elected I would have to say when chomp got up and made that speech yesterday and the Democrats ran for the doors and they didn't applaud for American jobs and they some of them didn't applaud for the widow of a fallen Navy Seal and they didn't applaud for all the things the Trump was talking he was kind of talking about you know making compromises and working with them I just thought wow wow this is a disaster for the Democrat Party I don't want to over blow it because you know Trump can sometimes step on his own feet he can blow himself up but that was here's dan henig her in the Wall Street Journal talking about the state of the Democrats that scene you saw at the moment president Trump ended his speech to a joint session of Congress was the Democrats abandoning the ship of state like the progressive street demonstrations endured by the country the past four weeks we may assume Congress's Democratic delegation organized their post speech bolt to the exits by the famous social media hashtag hashtag the resistance you'd have thought that a two-thirds at the two-thirds point when mr. Trump had him self destructed as expected when instead he was looking less like Alec Baldwin and more like president Trump the Chuck Schumer might have pulled out his smartphone to tweet the troops walk out maybe not a good idea not this crew on mosque they went over the side just as they refused to attend hearings for cabinet nah man and voted as a block against virtually all of them so they blew it I mean we talked about this yesterday they didn't see this coming it was like it really was like a freight train ran him right over as they SAT there in their old you know we're the resistance who was a Roseanne Barr tweeted the other day did you see this she tweeted Trump is the resistance and I think that that's exactly right so in the aftermath the press is scrambling how can we get back the narrative this is the presses problem since it began in Charlie Sykes who I think was speaking for all journalists left-wing commentator on MSNBC listen to him describe the speech his hopes for the future the Trump will now self-destruct and what he feels is happening to the press I mean that was a good speech it's going to help him you're going to get a bump agree assured jittery Republicans there were some genuine grace notes let's give it a minute I mean how many times that we had this discussion is he going to make a pivot is he going to make a turn and I think we're upper class those pieces is very important because what vo the point here is that nothing actually changed there is no policy he is the same Donald Trump as he was 24 hours Phoebe and he doesn't have this ability to change his tune when he needs to be in a different audience or needs to give a different a style of speech we have seen that from time to time in the campaign trail but this certainly was quite difficult word used to with Donald was it was a solid speech all the way I do think with the exception of Robert casa there's almost a a battered pundit syndrome going on out there where you know it he comes home and he's not abusive but he's not drunk and so we're just so incredibly grateful it's so incredibly good hearing the breast to a battered wife you know the only difference you know just is that of course wives don't deserve to be battered we're just getting the crap out of these guys should be a national sports I mean they really have been so dishonest and they immediately by the way talking about who's getting battered here's a chart from our friends and NewsBusters showing the negative coverage right is the red versus is the positive coverage for Trump in his first few days in his first month in office right and it's you know the difference if you can't see it the difference is insane i mean that the the negative comments look like Trump Tower and the positive comments are like a little hot off to the side so 74 to 8674 288 those are the comments and that's leaving out that's leaving now partisan commentaries leaving out people you know who actually were attacking the President or praising the president's just from the anchorman all right so I'm talking about this in the context I want just to remind you that in the context of remembering Andrew Breitbart has been gone for five years and so today the news trying to take this back going back to this stupid Russian story which I believe is a complete nothing burger I just think it is absolutely nothing just remember just remember that until Crimea was annexed Barack Obama was urging businessmen to do business with the Soviet Union the ad with the Soviet with the Russians he was going over to Russia Obama was accompanied by businessmen and by you know CEOs and saying we need to invest in Russia this is going to press the reset button bada bada ba and all that money was going to establish and strengthen the regime of Vladimir Putin I mean this is what Obama did until they annex with Crimea and he started to impose sanctions he was helping out the Russians of all those businessmen very very few of them had anything to do with Donald Trump Donald Trump took very very little business with the Russians less than a lot of people who were following obama's leads when they say Oh Paul Manafort he was over there representing Ukraine Obama wanted them to do that he asked them to do that so now they've got Jeff Sessions and they are claiming I mean they've gone they just gone nuts Elizabeth Warren says he has to quit and even Lindsey Graham who is like a useful idiot for the Democrats at this point he's saying you know any of this is true he has to recuse himself from investigating the Russian ties to the Trump campaign and all this al franken during his confirmation hearings asked jeff Sessions jeff Sessions confirmation hearings for attorney general this question and i believe i'm going to play the whole thing leave it to you to have it in context this is the question he asked and this is sessions reply CNN just published a story alleging that the intelligence community provided documents to the president-elect last week that included information that quote Russian operatives claims you have compromising personal and financial information about mr. Trump these documents also allegedly say quote there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government now again I'm telling you this as it's coming out so you know but if it's true it's obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign what will you do senator Franken I'm not aware of any of those activities I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians and I'm unable to comment on it okay so it turns out that he during this time he was on the Armed Services Committee and he did meet with the Russian ambassador a couple of times he says in connection with his duties as a senator not as a surrogate for the Donald Fox I mean it's the Russian ambassador everybody's met I have everybody in Washington meets with these ambassadors and so he met with them a couple times now they're saying oh well this is this is perjury this is perjury completely forgetting by the way that Al Franken himself committed this act of perjury here times good enough I'm smart enough and doggone it people like me every word untrue I mean every sickle and under oath as well all right so so here's what I'm going to say where you know like I'm going to pause here before we get into the bright part of it all I'm gonna pause to say goodbye to folks on Facebook and YouTube come on over to the daily wire calm and hear the rest of the show or subscribe and watch the rest of the show Plus put your questions in the mail bag and have your life changed possibly for the better ah
