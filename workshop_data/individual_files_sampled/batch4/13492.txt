one of the moments that Donald Trump had with the media that actually started to win me over to him that made me think oh maybe this guy knows what he's doing is Donald Trump use the term anchor baby you know people who come here and they have a baby and then they baby has American citizenship and you can bring the whole family he used the term anchor baby and the the reporter said don't you know that that term is offensive said how's that offensive what's what's it what donate he is it's just so offensive so Trump says well what would you like me to say said you know you should call them future dreaming undocumented flag waving dreaming baby tax pay whatever you know and Trump cuts him off and says yeah I think I'm gonna keep using anchor baby yeah yeah I think that's just fine I think that works this way it was so beautiful it's so highlighted that the absurdity of that oppressive culture that none of us really believes none of us really take seriously but we all feel that we have to comply
