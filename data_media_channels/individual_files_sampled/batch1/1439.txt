the slide into crisis in the countries which surround Lake Chad has been slow painful and largely ignored by the rest of the world what was the decade of chronic poverty and food and water shortages have seen two and a half million Africans displaced from their homes and 10 million made dependent on humanitarian aid the crisis is compounded by the bomb and gun attacks of the Boko Haram group for the first time in the world history we are seeing young girls and young boys been strapped in improvised bombs and using them Boko harem using them as instrument of war this has never happened anywhere before the level of displacement the level of gender-based violence that girls particularly adolescent girls are going through is unbelievable famine in the lake chad region was only averted after an emergency donor conference in Norway last year the latest donor conference in Berlin aimed to push on from that at the heart of this conference has been the need to look beyond the immediate crisis the ongoing Boko Haram attacks the ongoing food and water shortages and has started contemplate strategies for long-term stability and resilience in the region and to tackle what's been described here as the crisis of protection one important strand of that is to make sure women's skills and abilities are enabled in the four countries which surround the lake Nigeria Niger Chad and Cameroon education provide them access to resources change some of the legal obstacles that they might face in terms of land ownership in in terms of inheritance and also try to address issues of forced marriage the UN had estimated the funding requirement as one point five six billion dollars this conference has raised two point 1 billion assuming of course that the money pledged is donated I think it's a fair question and I hope people will keep asking it because the worst thing to do is to make a pledge and not deliver it that's worse than not making a place in the first place because you create expectations and you undermine confidence in the system if you then don't deliver delivering a solution for Lake Chad is seen as extraordinarily complex but as the meeting in Berlin shows the crisis described as the world most neglected is getting much needed wider attention and pledges of help for millions in need Paul Brennan al-jazeera Berlin
