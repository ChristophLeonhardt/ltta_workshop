okay so I'm gonna start off this hour we can go to Peter Baker but you know I want to get your take on this as well this is Sarah Huckabee Sanders answering questions about her quell her credibility she throws it back at the media saying the media is not very credible but these questions came up yesterday in the briefing because so much has come out of the podium come out from her mouth that has turned out not to be true especially the answer that she gave about the letter that was written about the meeting at Trump Tower and I guess members of the press felt it was finally time to ask whether she really is someone who should be believed take a look I don't know how many times I have to address this but I work every single day to give you accurate and up-to-date information and I'm going to continue to do that frankly I think my credibility is probably higher than the media's and I think that in large part that's because you guys spend more of your time focused on attacking the president instead of reporting the news I think that if you spent a little bit more time reporting the news instead of trying to tear me down you might actually see that we're working hard trying to provide you good information and trying to provide that same good information to the American people so there are a lot of questions to her Joe like why should we believe you when everything that you say or so much of import that you have to say from that podium turns out not to be true and she just kept turning around the media and here's the problem we're not covering negative stories about them we're covering the story about the president lying and then those lies being funneled through her podium and at what point does the press secretary and that whole briefing become completely null and void because it is not credible well a daily basis on a daily basis they get luck from the kitchen point get your point make up we've got your point and you know the fact is first of all let's just talk facts you can look at just about every poll that's been out on whether more Americans trust the media our trust the president the United States and even Fox News polls show by a wide margin the more Americans trust ABC CBS NBC The New York Times The Washington Post in the president the United States and yes yesterday the White House press corps was tough on them but you know we showed somebody from Fox News yesterday pushing Sarah Huckabee Sanders and this tweet from Brit Hume who's been very very tough on Trump critics from time to time and certainly been very tough on mutant molars Russian probe Brit Hume yesterday tweets no way around the fact that Trump team lied yeah no way around the fact that Trump's team lied when they said POTUS had nothing to do with a statement on the Trump Taylor meeting now they acknowledge he dictated his statement and Peter Baker there is one story after another story after another story that is not does not take a Pulitzer prize-winning columnist or a New York Times journalist to just stack one tweet up against another or one statement against the other to see as britt hume was saying yesterday that the White House is lying well you know it's funny I was thinking about this this morning I mean Sarah Sanders is I think my 12th White House press secretary and all the press doctors I've seen in the past when they got stuff wrong from time to time but when they did it was important and they understood that it was important because the credibility of what is put out at that podium is important to a White House as anything they do and what you saw in that clip you just showed us Sarah Sanders is a very trumpian response which is rather than say yeah I got it wrong or I was misinformed or we we should have said this or that instead turning it around and attacking the people who are asking the question but she did in fact get caught in a statement that was flatly not true what we don't know of course is did she know it was not true when she said it or was she provided misinformation that she passed along you suspect the latter and that's one reason why she doesn't want to because she doesn't want to you know get caught out between whoever it was told her that possibly even the president and that leaves her in a very awkward position it's certainly not a pleasant position for any press secretary to be and she's chosen to be there so you know sympathy only goes so far but it is a very awkward position for any SEC press secretary to be in when you're not being given the truth and you're being asked to go out there and put that out on camera on a daily basis well and you know we've all seen my gosh Susan page you were there during the Clinton administration as what speaker as was I and in in different different positions but you saw time and again the Clinton administration we all did where they told lies they told half-truths Bill Clinton shaded the truth they with great regularity but still we had Mike McCurry go up behind that podium Mike McCurry was always careful to defend the president as much as he could but also to make sure that he maintained credibility with a with a very hostile and very skeptical White House press corps yeah Mike had a great phrase which was that his job was to tell the truth slowly so he didn't always tell you everything he knew but you could be pretty confident that what he told you was going to be correct and in that way I think spokesman and spokeswoman for the for the president are very much like the reporters who cover them and that credibility is really your prime asset it really is what you bring to the table and so reporters try very hard to be accurate in everything they write and if they make a mistake we try to correct it and try to figure out why we made a mistake and not make it again and that is something that we forgive spokesman when they admit their their own mistakes as long as we feel like they're being honest workers there are real consequences also when a White House press our grades does not have credibility it makes things tougher down the road when the White House press are maybe saying something that is absolutely correct but people cannot be confident that it is yep Turk thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe to stay up on the day's biggest stories and you can click on
