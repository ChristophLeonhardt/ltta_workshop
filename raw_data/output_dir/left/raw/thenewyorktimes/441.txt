1
00:00:03,403 --> 00:00:05,739
O.K. so now you're going to get 
a chance to see

2
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,407
what it feels like to be in 
one of these suits.

3
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:08,808
So first thing you're 
going to do

4
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,910
is throw on your 
battery pack.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,912
It's going to make sure you
have good air circulation,

6
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,181
super important.

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:19,919
Next you're going to 
suit up.

8
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:25,558
All right now it's really 
important that you bring

9
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:26,659
lots of water and supplies
because now 

10
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,595
you're going to be hiking
through lava channels

11
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,563
for about three hours.

12
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,964
The HI-SEAS habitat is a
complex system.

13
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:07,300
We have over 100 electric
sensors that measure 

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,903
everything from temperature to
to solar radiation 

15
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,672
to water level.

16
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:18,878
When we may not get enough
charge from the solar panels,

17
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:21,047
we can make decisions like
whether or not we need to go

18
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:23,950
outside to start up the 
back up generator.

19
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,351
We don't have a lot of
communication 

20
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,021
with the outside world, so 
we're often on our own.

21
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,058
So Laura and I are going to 
take a sample of 

22
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:35,095
this lava flow here. From the 
sample we're going to take,

23
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,896
we're going to able to tell 
some things about  

24
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,065
the lava flow. So, something 
about its formational history

25
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,234
perhaps how quickly 
it cooled

26
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,869
maybe even the age 
of the lava flow.

27
00:01:56,716 --> 00:02:01,054
So I'm here in the garden
at the habitat.

28
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,523
And you're sitting inside one
of the planter boxes. 

29
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,728
Here on Mars, fresh food
is a luxury.

30
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:14,767
When it comes to canned items,
we have plenty of it.

31
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:20,773
Creamy potato cheddar soup.
You guessed it, powder.

32
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:26,779
White chicken in a can,
cubes with powder.

33
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:33,119
The dried huevos, that's right,
powder.

34
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,122
The marshmallows!
These are real.

35
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,991
But that's basically all we 
got here to eat

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,492
here on Mars.

37
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,209
All our communication with 
mission support 

38
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,411
with our friends and family 
is through email.

39
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,846
And that email goes through
 a server that introduces 

40
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,182
a 20-minute delay 
on each email.

41
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,918
So if I want to send 
one exchange

42
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,087
with someone outside 
the hab,

43
00:03:41,087 --> 00:00:00,000
it takes 40 minutes roundtrip.
