1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,705
I am Director X. I’m the
director of ‘Superfly’ 2018.

2
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,938
“I want to up our supply."

3
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:10,990
This scene is
Trevor and Michael

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,821
as Priest and Scatter,
the student and mentor.

5
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,320
On a couple levels,
you know Scatter

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,860
is Priest’s mentor
in the drug game

7
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,580
and also his teacher in
martial arts and jujitsu.

8
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,310
The wide shots are
really stunt people.

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,470
And then when you get
closer, obviously it’s them.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,928
Trevor actually has been doing
capoeira for maybe 10 years,

11
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:33,050
so he’s really excited
and really capable

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,190
to do these kinds of things.

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,844
And he was there a week
ahead of time doing the work

14
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:39,260
and getting the
choreography down.

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,460
Michael isn’t trained as far
as I know, but he’s a dancer.

16
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,990
He came out of a
dance background.

17
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,260
So physicality is still
pretty second nature to him.

18
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,020
So he didn’t spend as
much time rehearsing this,

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,500
but he’s a pro.

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,770
He can get there and make
it happen pretty quickly.

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:00,000
“You ain’t that good."
