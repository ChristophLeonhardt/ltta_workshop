SO, CALIFORNIA EARLIER THIS WEEK
PASSED CAP AND TRADE.
IT WAS AN EXTENSION OF EARLIER
LEGISLATION, IT WAS ABOUT TO GO
UNTIL 2020, AND WE ARE ALMOST
THERE, THEY EXTENDED IT TO 2030.
EDIT WAS A REALLY NICE MOMENT,
JERRY BROWN AND ARNOLD
SCHWARZENEGGER WERE TOGETHER,
AND THEY RAISED EACH OTHER'S
HANDS, BECAUSE ARNOLD IS ON THE
RIGHT SIDE OF THAT ISSUE.
TELUS ABOUT CAP AND TRADE, AND
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT.
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IT MAKES
JERRY BROWN ONE OF THE
PREMIER EXPERTS ON THIS ISSUE.
I KNOW THERE WAS SOME CRITICISM
OF THIS DETAIL OR THAT
DETAIL, BUT TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
WAS AMAZING.
AND HE GOT EIGHT REPUBLICAN
MEMBERS, AND REPUBLICAN
GOVERNORS AS WELL, TO ENDORSE
THE LEGISLATION, SO WHAT IT DOES
IS PUT A PRICE ON CARBON,
THROUGH THE CAP AND TRADE
MECHANISM.
IT GREATLY BENEFITS CANADA AS
WELL, BECAUSE ONTARIO HAS
JOINED, QU…BEC IS ñ QU…BEC HAS
ALREADY JOINED, ONTARIO IS ABOUT
TO.
MEXICO.
3 WEEKS AGO, I WAS IN AUSTRALIA,
AND I TOOK FOUR LETTERS FROM HIM
TO THE PREMIERES OF THE FOUR
LARGEST STATES IN AUSTRALIA ñ
IT'S THE SAME DEAL THERE, THEY
HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT
DOESN'T HAVE ITS ACT TOGETHER.
SO, CALIFORNIA IS REALLY KIND OF
LEADING THE WAY IN THE U.S., BUT
YOU GOT A LOT OF OTHER STATES
TOO, SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
IS CAP AND TRADE THE RIGHT WAY
TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE?
IF I HAD MY DRUTHERS, I WOULD
HAVE A TAX ON CARBON, AND CAP
AND TRADE, AND A CERTAIN
PERCENTAGE GOING TOWARDS
RENEWABLES GOING UP EVERY YEAR.
BUT THE RESISTANCE, OF COURSE
BECAUSE OF HOW THE IDEOLOGICAL
ARGUMENT HAS BEEN SHAPED, MAKES
IT EASIER IN MOST JURISDICTIONS
TO GO FOR THE INDIRECT PRICE ON
CARBON, WHICH Added TRADE IS.
EVEN IN CHINA, BY THE WAY, I
HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND THERE WHO IS
THEIR TOP, GUY, WORKS FOR XI
JINPING, THEY FLOATED A CARBON
TAX IN CHINA COMMENTED A LOT OF
RESISTANCE FROM THE REGIONAL
INDUSTRIAL LEADERS ñ REQUESTED A
DICTATORSHIP, BUT NOT TOTALLY
ñ SO THEY DIVERTED TO A CAP AND
TRADE THERE AS WELL.
SWEDEN, PROBABLY DOING THE BEST
JOB OF ANY COUNTRY, HAS BOTH CAP
AND TRADE, AND A CARBON TAX, AND
EVENTUALLY I HOPE WE WILL HAVE A
CARBON TAX.
A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAX IS
SOMETHING I'VE SUPPORTED FOR
MORE THAN 25 YEARS, BUT WHEN I
REALIZED THAT WAS AN ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE SELL, I SAID, OKAY,
SECOND BEST IS CAP AND
TRADE, LET'S DO THAT.
THE FIRST PRESIDENT BUSH HAD
DONE THAT TO STOP SULFUR
DIOXIDE, AND HELP CURE ACID
RAIN, AND IT WORKED, BETTER THAN
A LOT OF US EXPECTED IT WOULD.
SO I SAID LET'S DO THAT.
THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED THE
EFFORT, AND THE REPUBLICAN
AUTHORS OF THE FIRST CAP AND
TRADE PLAN IMMEDIATELY
SWITCHED, AND SAID YOU ARE FOR
IT?
WE ARE NOW AGAINST IT.
NOT SAYING THAT TO ME, BUT TO
THE DEMOCRATS.
WHERE HAVE I SEEN THAT MOVIE
BEFORE?
HERITAGE FOUNDATION PROPOSED A
HEALTHCARE PLAN BEFORE.
SAME THING, GOOD CATCH.
