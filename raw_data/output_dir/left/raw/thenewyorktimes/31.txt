1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
“Over the past eight weeks,
I’ve witnessed firsthand

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,300
the Senate’s deep appreciation
for the vital role

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,990
of the American judiciary.”

4
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,950
“This confirmation process has
become a national disgrace.”

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,020
“The first thing
that makes a good judge

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,990
is independence,
not being swayed

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:27,550
by political or
public pressure —

8
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,070
that takes some backbone.”

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,600
“This whole two-week
effort has been

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,730
a calculated and
orchestrated political hit

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,720
fueled with apparent pent-up
anger about President Trump

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,060
and the 2016 election,

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,930
revenge on behalf
of the Clintons,

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,200
and millions of dollars
in money from outside

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,160
left-wing opposition groups.”

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,600
“The Supreme Court

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,540
must never, never be viewed
as a partisan institution.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,310
The justices on
the Supreme Court

19
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,110
do not sit on opposite
sides of an aisle.”

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,489
“There has been a frenzy
on the left to come up

21
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,320
with something, anything.”

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,690
“The behavior of several
of the Democratic members

23
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,040
of this committee
at my hearing

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,320
a few weeks ago was
an embarrassment.”

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,260
“This is a circus.”

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,140
“The Supreme Court
is the last line of defense

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,050
for the separation of powers.”

28
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,920
“My judicial philosophy
is straightforward:

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,810
A judge must be independent.”

30
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,970
“I do not decide cases
based on personal or

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,790
policy preferences.”

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,620
“Are you saying that
Doctor Ford’s efforts

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,620
to come forward, to prepare for
the very difficult testimony

34
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,007
she gave today,
have all been part

35
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:38,340
of an orchestrated
political hit,

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,840
and are you
basically calling her

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,410
some kind of
political operative?”

38
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,910
“I’ve said, my family has
no ill will toward Dr. Ford.”

39
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,260
“But you’re not
saying in any way

40
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,770
that she is a political pawn,
political operative?”

41
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,200
“I said all allegations
should be taken seriously.”

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,510
“And you made the allegation
that she was coordinating it.

43
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,010
I do not think she
was coordinating —”

44
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,720
“I did not say that.
That‘s a —”

45
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,820
“You said — I’m sorry —

46
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,080
so you said that others
were making a coordinated —”

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,340
“Coordinated by people
in this room.”

48
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,590
“Not her. So she was not —”

49
00:02:07,590 --> 00:00:00,000
“People in this room
coordinated it.”
