<font color="#E5E5E5">dynamism will return to the United</font>

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,519
public policies is that a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

6
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:10,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">just cyclical and will come back or does</font>

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,219
the government have to do something

8
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,170
specific to cause that to happen I think

9
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">it matters a lot but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this point I'm</font>

10
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,520
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimistic about reform</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and many if</font>

11
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,010
any policy areas at all I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

12
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,140
make further progress by inventing new

13
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,880
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't much regulated yet</font>

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,699
and out racing bad policy I look at so

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,099
many policy areas regulation regulatory

16
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,529
reform health care reform it's all

17
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,360
failing we're not making improvements or

18
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,160
going backwards as we were discussing

19
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">before the new Republican</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font>

20
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,879
plan appears to be a step backwards

21
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,219
Trump's get rid of two regulations for

22
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:43,260
everyone passed maybe it's better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,370
nothing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

24
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective compared to the total stock of</font>

25
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,600
regulation it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work so</font>

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,980
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does it matter the Donald Trump</font>

27
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,690
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> president does that does that concern</font>

28
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,289
you about these trends if I mean because

29
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,300
setting aside his ideology he does not

30
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,980
seem like an especially competent

31
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,210
manager of the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

32
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,340
bureaucracy I sometimes called Trump the

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,470
placebo president he will talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big</font>

34
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,330
game but for domestic policy I think

35
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,760
change remarkably little I worry much

36
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,530
more about foreign policy not the topic

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my book but there I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

38
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,939
president<font color="#E5E5E5"> matters much more can there be</font>

39
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,799
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefits from Trump as a placebo</font>

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,110
president you talk of absolutely so so

41
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,729
walk us through how that could help

42
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:22,890
here's a scenario I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying this is</font>

43
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,150
how things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and so first of all</font>

44
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,680
explain what you mean when you say he's

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,479
the placebo president that people feel

46
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,009
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he says all kinds of</font>

47
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,200
things no one else would say and we get

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,079
certain tendencies out of our system so

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,479
if attacking immigrants say is a

50
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,189
substitute for doing something worse

51
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,710
there's at least a scenario under which

52
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,210
that's a better alternative than

53
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,560
something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might have happened</font>

54
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,110
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the positive scenario but</font>

55
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,579
something has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> going wrong in</font>

56
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,229
American society you see it in wage

57
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,659
growth opioid abuse many other social

58
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,290
indicators as you know sometimes it's

59
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,479
better to get the bad reaction to that

60
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,219
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> with quickly while your civil</font>

61
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,140
society still is strong and you can

62
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,780
react and respond in protest and you

63
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,430
know for eight years from now make

64
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,259
another decision and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it's better</font>

65
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,910
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that happen now than 20 years</font>

66

<font color="#E5E5E5">later when some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our problems are</font>
