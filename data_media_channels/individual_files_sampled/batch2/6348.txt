Ted Cruz is the conservative Family Values senator from Texas that's what he tells us all the time so it was curious that late last night he liked something on Twitter that's got everybody scratching their heads if you will as to what he was doing and thinking last night let's show you a PC version of the of the tweet here or a PG version I should say now what that lady is looking at is a couple copulating in the living room she is then excited by that copulation and finds uh winds up pleasuring herself now this is a thing that Ted Cruz is very much against he even wrote legal briefs against pleasuring yourself which I'll get to in a little bit so it's not just a silly story it also has important ramifications if you will so of course Twitter then immediately exploded as it apparently senator Cruz okay just getting started so he was referencing a porn there he apparently very very much like there was someone on his staff or his staff very much liked it so there's no question that it was like and it stayed up for at least 40 minutes now I'm gonna show you a couple of my own tweets here and we're just warming up here because the main thing I want to show you is your guys response to my tweets so I wrote can't wait for the Ted Cruz book if I did it here's how it happened actually wait wouldn't read that book of my life dependent on it then I went to first Ted Cruz was known as a serial killing killer now he's known as a serial masturbator what are compassed Rafi so now I'm gonna get to the serial masturbator in a second because this is not his only masturbation controversy believe it or not this is an awesome story okay then I went to hashtag what happened is no longer just titled Hillary's book it's the ration Ted Cruz has this morning when he turned on Twitter then here's the main reason I'm sharing these tweets the responses from you guys were awesome here was the first response to that last three why what happened with the lady that's such a great picture I love that picture why would happen okay I saw a couple of screenshots and one was the couple in mid copulation the other one was when she had got to work on herself and the guy was outside and boy I mean these are some heart issues attacking okay but ted cruz's the man with a job I know it's a little sticky but anyway so now then somebody sent in this tweet which that might be my favorite picture of all time Ted Cruz dialing for Donald Trump with Jordans crime face on it you guys are awesome all right so now then there's general Twitter they want to work on my homes too as did he himself so here is Matthew writing in its matthew d ambrosio me waiting for ted cruz to respond to this drama okay and then here's Jon Favreau this is the night that Ted Cruz became president that's really funny okay then his old pressor roommate got back into the action now this guy stays Craig Mazin he ruled with Ted Cruz and he is the first one to point out that Ted Cruz is a serial masturbator so he had pointed this out back in 2016 when Cruz was running for president he said Ted Cruz thinks people don't have a right to quote stimulate their genitals I was his college roommate this would be a new belief of his now so that's an old controversy I'm gonna get back to that because that actually is the substantive part of this story Ted Cruz is wanted to put people in jail for pleasuring themselves I'm not kidding so I can't wait to see who he's gonna lock up in his own office whether it's him or a staffer okay we'll get to that in a second but Craig Mazin his roommate now jumps back in today and says now imagine Ted Cruz is doing this doing this four feet below you in the bottom bunk bed yes my misery very much appreciates your company now look if Ted Cruz was a young male masquerading in college that is not going to be breaking news and it must might actually be one of the most human things he's done on the other hand doing it while the other guys still in the room I hope not a direction a lot of other dudes too went in okay so I mean how uncomfortable that hey I'm your freshman year roommate good to meet you good to meet you all right anyway let's call it a night what in the world is he doing Jesus Christ you're awkward dead and then speaking of awkward just a little while ago he had tweeted this we have to deliver now I believe we can come together we have to this sounds like something that might say we have to come together we have to all right Ted all right okay so Craig is also thinking along the similar lines as I am this college roommate sadly the fact that Ted Cruz Jax offed a meteor core porn spam is the most human thing we can say about him this is actually his high point I agree well actually it was maybe a little bit high and then not high at all anymore after that but so and I don't know that it was mediocre I've yet to watch that clip but I thought I wonder who she is why is she looking in who are they how does this all end no I would did for Ted Cruz anyway look him you know masturbating to porn whatever who cares I don't care I don't care that he didn't in college although can't have the decency wait for your roommate to leave the room and and I don't care that he does it as a senator or as a grown man what I do care about is is hypocrisy back in 2004 he was the Solicitor General for the state of Texas he wrote and a 76 page brief let me tell you what was in that brief let's go to Vanity Fair here he was defending a state law banning the sale and advertisement of sex toys or quote obscene devices as he called them an offense he then punishable by up to two years in jail in fact he continued banning obscene devices he he continued banning obscene devices was in the public interest and the government should be granted police powers for the purposes of quote discouraging period interest is sexual gratification combating the commercial sale of sex and protecting minors indeed he went on to save furthermore using obscene devices the state argued was akin to hiring a quote hiring a willing prostitute or engaging in consensual consensual bigamy now that data I don't even know where that logic is going that's so insane I can t keep it keep up with that but if you went with ted cruz logic that he himself wrote I guess the ted cruz is a bigamist for having sex with himself that logic is so insane maybe he needed a sex device so that's him and another object making him a bigamist of some sort or that he is basically prostituting himself i does not my insane logic it's Ted Cruz's insane logic this is why he's considered an intellectual heavyweight on the right and then here comes the killer quote from Ted Cruz and the rest of the guys who wrote this brief there is no substantive due process right this stimulate one's genitals for non-medical purposes unrelated to procreation or outside of an interpersonal relationship Wow he said there is no substantive due process right to stimulate one's genitals hey man here's what I have to say to that lock him up lock him up he thought that should be a sentence of two years in jail if you stimulated yourself in in the general area well if it wasn't him it was definitely somebody on his staff one way or another that was getting stimulated last night in Ted Cruz's office I assume he's looking to throw them in jail as we speak this is the insanity that is the right wing today in America so Frank Thorpe v writes in Ted Cruz just now just jokes about light porn tweet so he's trying to make light of it now that he's in a lot of trouble not in a lot of trouble but like in an awkward situation he says Cruz apparently said perhaps we should have done something like this during the Indiana primary reelection campaign okay wait are you a family values guy or not should people go to jail for stimulating their own genitals or should they not or all of a sudden like oh you know the right way does not stop masturbation you know what I'm saying okay so now that the joking by Cruz has subsided who are you gonna blame because there's no way he's gonna take it on blame you know who's gonna blame his own staff if you will and which is correct one way or another all right so there he said there are a number of people on the team who have access to the on account but it appears that someone inadvertently hit the like button when we discovered the post which I was I guess an hour or two later we pulled it down and then up and then down and then up and then down and then we were done with it okay fine he didn't say that last part okay if you notice that was a non-denial denial he said there are a number of people on the team who have access he didn't say I didn't do it he's one of the people who has access he says it appears someone inadvertently hit the button he didn't say who and he said when we discovered the post we pulled it down he did not deny that it was him and he is a lawyer he writes 76 page briefs he knows what he's saying he says it was a staffing issue again you could take that two different ways and it was inadvertent it was a mistake it was not a deliberate act we're dealing with it internally and then we're dealing with an inside and outside that inside and outside but it was a mistake it was not malicious he never denied it so then finally a reporter as he's leaving is like wait wait but is it you or someone else was it you senator Cruz and he according to the reporters whispered no oh daddy two years lock him up lock him up which then could be a different porn which reality kiss could be interested in they had made this offer reality Kings would like to offer Ted Cruz a free lifetime membership for making in our morning so special DM us hashtag Ted Cruz did nothing wrong yes today or late last night he did nothing wrong we are professors we don't care what you do with your own sex life or your own members or what it is that you're doing and if you fire your staffers now don't do that don't have a scapegoat then you'll be short-staffed which we suspected you were anyway anyway don't punish your staff that's what you were doing last night so we want any of that stuff happening but what we do want is for Ted Cruz to come out and say I'm sorry I should have never written that memo saying that people who simulate their own genitals should be imprisoned that was a terrible mistake of mine because obviously at a minimum someone on my own staff would be locked up if I had it my way I'm waiting for that apology that is unlikely to come but at unlike Ted Cruz but at least we know what an incredible hypocrite senator Cruz is now if you didn't already know TYT membership gets you commercial free young turks downloaded streaming podcasts that
