more CEOs who have been involved in Donald Trump's manufacturing council have decided to resign from that Council following his refusal to denounce white supremacy in America later on he did denounce white supremacy and then he took it back during a press conference that occurred today where he said yeah there's violence on both sides now the first CEO to pull out of this council was the CEO of Merck & Co CEO Ken Frazier the only african-american on the council was first to step down to quote take a stand against intolerance and extremism the move drew an immediate rebuke from Trump who claimed on Twitter that the pharmaceuticals chief would now have more time to lower ripoff drug prices how about you Trump how about you do something about drug prices you claimed you were gonna do something about it but you haven't done anything at all in fact you've been working closely with pharmaceutical companies and giving them a pass so it's your responsibility to do something in regard to policy to actually hone pharmaceutical companies in any way let me give you his exact tweet he said now that Ken Frazier and Merck Pharma has resigned from president's manufacturing Council he will have more time to lower ripoff drug prices in all caps look guys this is super important this is part of the Charlottesville's story and part of the second strike against Donald Trump this is monumental because once he loses those people in power he's got very little left and what did I tell you he's too stupid to know what to do and what not to do if you yell at a guy who just left the manufacturing council who is the CEO of Merck that's gonna send a message to all other business people don't do business with Trump because if you do if there's even a slight disagreement he's gonna try to go after you it is a monumentally bad idea if you're trying to get allies but he's too stupid to know the difference and so once he did that just as I suspected boom out goes to more people he criticized them and out goes the fourth so Anna's gonna tell you about that all right so the sec CEO to resign was Kevin Plank he is the CEO of Under Armour he quit the group to focus my efforts on inspiring every person that they can do anything through the power of sport which promotes you to do diversity and inclusion nice little plug for your business but that's okay he's the CEO Kevin Plank previously had gotten criticism for supporting Trump too much right and even he bailed out but the reason they're bailing out is not necessarily because of Charlottesville although that's really bad that's the reason that I can't Fraser left in the first place but the other guys are mainly leaving because of what how Trump treated Ken Frazier because they got the memo that if you stay with this guy he's gonna knife you at some point so they're like no no this guy's a madman we're out the CEO of Intel also pulled out he resigned to quote call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues I resigned because I want to make progress while many in Washington seem more concerned with attacking anyone who disagrees with them we should honor not attack those who have stood up for equality and other cherished American values so that that's the most important quote because that's the Intel CEO going you're gonna attack people who don't agree with you so we were here to support you on this council and then when Ken leaves now you're viciously attacking him in public no that's not how we roll and he does it with lawmakers he's doing it with CEOs who have decided to resign I mean that's that's his strategy anyone who disagrees with him will be bullied on social media and he thinks that's a winning strategy no you're turning allies into enemies which is great right for us it's good it is no no that's that so I'm not saying that these CEOs are good guys and everything they do this the right decision to make and I applaud them for making it but what I'm and I'm not telling you that they're even doing it for the right reasons what I'm telling you is if you the one thing that they're powerful do not like is when the powerful are touched so if it's higher drug prices and you have to pay it not such a big problem right we invade a country and a bunch of people die over there not such a big problem yourself with my friend no no no no we're not gonna have that not only did you insult my friend but that implies that you're gonna come after me next it's a terrible strategic mistake by Donald Trump thank God that noise you hear is the noise of power leaving the building and if you don't have that kind of power behind you and you're a Republican what do you have not much all you have left is those guys in Charlottesville and you ain't going win elections with that he's in a war or the trouble if you liked this video you'll love the whole TYT Network check it out at TYT Network comm slash join
