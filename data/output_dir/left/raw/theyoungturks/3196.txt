1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,689
>>NEW VIDEO SHOWS A NORTH KOREAN
DEFECTOR WHO MANAGED TO ESCAPE,

2
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:10,430
EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SHOT FIVE
TIMES IN THE PROCESS OF DOING

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,430
SO.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:14,631
THIS WAS A 24-YEAR-OLD
MEMBER OF THE NORTH KOREAN

5
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:20,550
MILITARY, AND HE DID DEFECT, HE
DID MANAGE TO CROSS OVER TO

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,650
SOUTH KOREA, AND HE IS RECEIVING
MEDICAL ATTENTION AT THE MOMENT.

7
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,220
HE IS EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.

8
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,770
BUT THE STORY IS INSANE,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TAKE A

9
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:32,220
LOOK AT THE VIDEO, TAKE A QUICK
LOOK AT THAT.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,340
>>YOU SEE THE NORTH KOREAN
MILITARY JEEP SPEEDING PAST

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,600
CHECKPOINTS, HEADING TOWARDS THE
BORDER WITH SOUTH KOREA.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
INSIDE,

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,999
THE SOLDIER BENT ON DEFECTING.

14
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,359
AS HE GETS CLOSER TO THE

15
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,719
DEMILITARIZED ZONE NORTH KOREAN
SOLDIERS REACTING FROM THERE

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,839
POST, SCRAMBLING TOWARDS THE
VEHICLE.

17
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:53,920
ONCE THE JEEP CRASHES

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,890
INTO A DITCH NEAR THE LINE THAT
DIVIDES THE TWO NATIONS, HE SETS

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,789
OUT ON FOOT, RUNNING, AS THE
NORTH KOREAN GUARDS BEGIN

20
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:02,789
SHOOTING.

21
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,480
DOZENS OF ROUNDS FIRED
AT THE DEFECTOR, EVEN AS HE

22
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,830
CROSSES THAT CRUCIAL LINE TO
FREEDOM.

23
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:12,480
>>AT SOME POINT THE NORTH KOREAN
SOLDIERS SEE HIM AND SEE WHAT

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,940
HE'S DOING, THEY START FIRING AT
HIM, MULTIPLE ROUNDS, AND

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,820
HITTING HIM, AND HE STILL
SURVIVES ENOUGH TO CRAWL TO

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,700
SAFETY, TO GET BEHIND THE WALL.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,290
>>CRITICALLY WOUNDED, SHOT FIVE
OR SIX TIMES, HEAT SIGNATURE

28
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,220
FROM CAMERAS SHOW TWO SOUTH
KOREAN SECURITY FORCES CRAWLING

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,540
TOWARDS THE DEFECTOR TO CARRY
HIM OUT AND EVACUATE HIM TO

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,570
A NEARBY MEDICAL CENTER.

31
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,000
>>THAT IS GREAT FOOTAGE, AND A
GREAT REPORT BY ABC, CHECK OUT

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,580
THE LINK DOWN BELOW FOR THE
WHOLE REPORT.

33
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,040
LOOK, THAT IS THE

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,780
THAT WAS
AMAZING.

36
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,570
HE TOOK FIVE BULLETS

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,640
FOR FREEDOM.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,880
A DAY LATER THEY
FLEW HIM TO A HOSPITAL DOWN PAST

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,680
SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA AND REMOVED
FIVE BULLETS FROM HIS BODY.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,310
>>THEY DID, AND TO GIVE YOU SOME
MORE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MANY

41
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,369
TIMES THEY SHOT AT HIM,
ACCORDING TO REPORTS THE

42
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:14,769
SOLDIERS FIRED AT HIM ABOUT 40
TIMES, HITTING HIM WITH BULLETS

43
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:18,590
FROM BOTH PISTOLS AND AN AK-47.

44
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,549
ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE WAS

45
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:26,069
THE DEMILITARIZED SONG THAT HE
CROSSED INTO, AND AT THAT POINT,

46
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:29,909
THE NORTH KOREAN SOLDIERS BASED
ON A CEASE-FIRE AGREEMENT ARE

47
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,909
SUPPOSED TO BE SHOOTING AT HIM,
BUT THEY DID SO ANYWAY.

48
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:34,909
NOW

49
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:39,410
THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT THEY
VIOLATED THE ARMISTICE AGREEMENT

50
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,609
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES, I
DON'T THINK NORTH KOREA CARES AT

51
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:43,049
ALL.

52
00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:47,540
>>IF YOU START FIRING INTO THAT
ZONE YOU ARE REALLY RISKING

53
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,829
WAR, AND THEY DID FIRE INTO THAT
ZONE, WHICH THEY AREN'T SUPPOSED

54
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,700
TO DO, AND THEY PHYSICALLY
CROSSED OVER AS WELL.

55
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
NORTH

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,440
KOREA HAS A LOT OF BLUSTER AND
THEY DO A LOT OF MISSILE TESTS,

57
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,629
BUT GENERALLY THEY DON'T CROSS
THAT ZONE.

58
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:01,969
IF THEY DO THEN

59
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:05,000
OBVIOUSLY SOUTH KOREA WILL CROSS
IT BACK AND WE ARE BACK IN THE

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,230
MIDDLE OF A WAR.

61
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,219
IT WAS A
DANGEROUS MOMENT THERE, BUT I

62
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:13,069
THINK THAT WHAT THEY FOUND IN
THE SOLDIER OTHER THAN THE

63
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,519
BULLETS IS, IN SOME WAYS, MORE
AMAZING.

64
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,599
>>IT IS INSANE.

65
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,260
>>IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT
IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING

66
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,260
INSIDE NORTH KOREA --

67
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:37,709
>>AND THE PHOTO I'M ABOUT 
TO

68
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:39,299
SHOW YOU IS OF THE PARASITIC

69
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,299
WORMS SO IF YOU ARE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT I WANT

70
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,269
TO GIVE THAT WARNING, BUT WITH
THAT SAID, HERE IS A PHOTO OF

71
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:51,840
WHAT THE DOCTORS PULLED OUT OF
HIS INTESTINES.

72
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
THEY ALSO FOUND

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,090
OUT THAT HE IS SUFFERING FROM
HEPATITIS, IT'S A FORM OF

74
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:02,069
HEPATITIS THAT USUALLY SPREADS
FROM UNSANITARY HOSPITALS

75
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:03,159
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

76
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,450
>>WHEN THEY WE USE SYRINGES
THEY SHOULDN'T USE, NEEDLES,

77
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,790
ETC.

78
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,959
IT TURNS OUT THAT A
SHOCKING PERCENTAGE OF NORTH

79
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,340
KOREAN DEFECTORS HAVE PARASITIC
WORMS IN THEIR BODY.

80
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
PART OF THE

81
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,610
REASON IS THEY USE HUMAN MANURE
FOR FARMING, WHICH YOU AREN'T

82
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,349
SUPPOSED TO DO. AND THERE IS
EASY THINGS YOU CAN DO TO AVOID

83
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:31,240
THESE WORMS, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
ANY MONEY, THEY HAVE NOTHING.

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
IN

85
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,080
ONE CASE THEY DID A STUDY OF
NORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS, AND OF

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,660
THE WOMEN THEY STUDIED, I THINK
IT WAS ALL WOMEN, SEVEN OUT OF

87
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,970
THE 17 HAD WORMS IN THEIR
BODIES, AND ABOUT 10% OF THE

88
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,870
DEFECTORS SO FAR HAVE HEPATITIS
B. IT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE

89
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,590
NORMAL PRECAUTIONS THAT ANYWHERE
ELSE IN THE WORLD YOU WOULD

90
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:58,500
TAKE, BECAUSE NORTH KOREA IS
BASICALLY ONE GIANT

91
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
CONCENTRATION.

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,881
THERE'S 25
MILLION PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN

93
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:08,349
NORTH KOREA, THEY ARE HOSTAGES
TO KIM JONG-UN AND THE RULING

94
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:14,349
CLASS IN NORTH KOREA.

95
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:17,150
PEOPLE
LIKE THIS -- HIS LAST NAME IS

96
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:21,580
OH, WE DON'T KNOW HIS FIRST
NAME, WE KNOW IT ISN'T STEVE --

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:28,470
PEOPLE LIKE HIM ARE WILLING TO
WHISK THEIR LIVES TO GET OUT OF

98
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,220
THIS HELLHOLE.

99
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,949
NORTH KOREA IS
ONE OF THE MOST INTRACTABLE

100
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:35,560
PROBLEMS ON THE PLANET, YOU ARE
DAMNED IF YOU DO, DAMNED IF YOU

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,270
DON'T. IF YOU START HOSTILITIES
WITH THEM THEY CAN LAUNCH OTHER

102
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:43,440
MISSILES AND KILL MILLIONS AT A
BARE MINIMUM IN SOUTH KOREA, LET

103
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,199
ALONE THE 25 MILLION WHO WILL
GET HURT WHEN SOUTH KOREA,

104
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,730
JAPAN, THE UNITED STATES
COUNTERSTRIKE.

105
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,039
AND KILLING NORTH

106
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,970
KOREANS -- LINDSAY GRAHAM
RECENTLY FLIPPANTLY TALKED ABOUT

107
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,520
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

108
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,699
NO, YOU ARE
KILLING PEOPLE IN A

109
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,860
CONCENTRATION CAMP.

110
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,740
BOMBING THE
NORTH KOREANS IS TERRIBLE.

111
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,740
ON

112
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,830
THE OTHER HAND, THEY HAVE
ENSLAVED THESE PEOPLE FOR

113
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,909
DECADES.

114
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,620
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
SUFFERING UNDER UNIMAGINABLE

115
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,280
CIRCUMSTANCES.

116
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,180
I LOVE TO DO
CONSTRUCTIVE CRITIQUES, NOT JUST

117
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,680
BLINDLY SAY THAT PERSON IS BAD
OR THAT SITUATION IS TERRIBLE,

118
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,629
AND NOT GIVE YOU AN ANSWER --
BUT NORTH KOREA IS A VERY

119
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:26,560
DIFFICULT SITUATION WITH NOT A
LOT OF GREAT ANSWERS.

120
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
I KNOW

121
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,990
THAT WAR IS NOT THE ANSWER, I
THINK THE ANSWER IS TO APPLY

122
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,099
EVERY KIND OF DIPLOMACY WE CAN
TO CHINA, WHICH IS THE ONLY

123
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:38,610
COUNTRY BASICALLY PROPPING UP
THE NORTH KOREAN REGIME.

124
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,610
AND BY

125
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,100
HOOK OR BY CROOK WE NEED TO GET
CHINA TO AGREE WITH US TO

126
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,099
SOMEHOW, WITHOUT HAVING THE
NORTH KOREANS LAUNCH, TAKE OUT

127
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:49,930
THE LEADERSHIP AND
FREE THOSE PEOPLE.

128
00:06:49,930 --> 00:00:00,000
BUT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT
PROBLEM.
