person breaking news is coming overnight
as well in the last few hours we are in
Lisbon a helicopter crash 18 people have
died when a helicopter carrying all
workers crashed this morning in the
Krasny asked region of Siberia seems it
happened shortly after takeoff the
aircraft's fuel tanks were full the
helicopter was carrying 15 all workers
and a three crew at the time there is
some suggestion that there could have
been some kind of collision with another
helicopters propeller blades or hitting
some kind of cargo held by another
helicopter it was forced to ditch its
load mid landing but as I say there are
reports of casualties of this morning 18
