1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,265
MENTALITY CULTURE.

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:07,470
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON KANYE'S

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,105
DEVELOPING FRIENDSHIP IN THE

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:09,639
PROGRAM.

5
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:12,375
WE'LL HAVE ACTION TO ALL OF

6
00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:13,943
THESE DEVELOPMENTS TONIGHT.

7
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:15,411
WE'LL HAVE MORE FROM A

8
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:16,312
GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE WHO I

9
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:19,615
SAID I WANT TO WIN TO BE THE

10
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:21,517
NEXT GOVERNOR.

11
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:23,653
RON DeSANTOS.

12
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:25,888
I KNOW THIS IS JUST RELEASED.

13
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:27,857
WE'RE POURING THROUGH THE 49

14
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:28,157
PAGES.

15
00:00:28,157 --> 00:00:29,625
WE KNOW THE HATRED STRZOK AND

16
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:31,394
PAGE HAVE FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP.

17
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:32,962
WHAT DO YOU HAVE SO FAR?

18
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:35,932
>> SEAN, I THINK THIS IS

19
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,200
INCOMPLETE PRODUCTION.

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,936
WE KNOW THEIR TEXTING HABITS,

21
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,370
HOW OFTEN THEY WERE TEXTING IN

22
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,473
OTHER PERIODS, THIS IS THE

23
00:00:43,473 --> 00:00:45,208
PERIOD DECEMBER 2016 DURING THE

24
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,709
TRUMP TRANSITION ALL THE WAY UP

25
00:00:46,709 --> 00:00:48,211
TO THE FIRING OF JAMES COMEY AND

26
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,612
THEN THE APPOINTMENT OF ROBERT

27
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:52,248
MUELLER AS A SPECIAL COUNSEL.

28
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:53,883
IF THERE'S ONLY 40 SOME PAGES

29
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:54,884
THERE, THERE'S GAPS.

30
00:00:54,884 --> 00:00:56,118
SOME OF THE STUFF IS INCOMPLETE.

31
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:58,754
SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS A FULL

32
00:00:58,754 --> 00:00:59,522
PRODUCTION.

33
00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:00,490
I THINK THERE'S MORE QUESTIONS

34
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,791
THAT THIS RAISES AND WE'RE GOING

35
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,293
TO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE

36
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:05,394
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND ASK THEM

37
00:01:05,394 --> 00:01:07,797
WHY THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO RECOVER

38
00:01:07,797 --> 00:01:10,633
THE FULL STRZOK-PAGE TEXTS.

39
00:01:10,633 --> 00:01:11,934
>> Sean: CONGRESSMAN, I HAD

40
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,636
MULTIPLE SOURCES TELLING ME

41
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,071
TONIGHT THAT THEY SUSPECT THAT

42
00:01:15,071 --> 00:01:16,873
THERE WERE OTHER DEVICES USED AS

43
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:17,173
WELL.

44
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:18,841
DID YOU GET THAT?

45
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,476
IS THAT YOUR INTERPRETATION

46
00:01:20,476 --> 00:01:22,411
LOOKING AT THIS?

47
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,312
>> YES.

48
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:25,414
WE'VE ALSO HAVE REASON TO

49
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:26,949
BELIEVE THAT THEY WERE USING

50
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:28,784
SOMETHING CALLED THE CLEAN

51
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:29,118
G-MAIL.

52
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:30,553
EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THE

53
00:01:30,553 --> 00:01:31,954
ACCOUNTS AND YOU DO MESSAGES IN

54
00:01:31,954 --> 00:01:33,656
THE DRAFT AND RESPOND TO DRAFTS

55
00:01:33,656 --> 00:01:35,224
SO YOU'RE NOT SENDING E-MAILS.

56
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:37,593
SO YEAH, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

57
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:38,528
THAT THEY DO.

58
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:39,328
USING I MESSAGE.

59
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,130
SO WE HAVE TO GET ALL OF THAT

60
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,132
THAT WE CAN GET FOR SURE.

61
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:44,500
THIS IS NOT IT.

62
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,135
SEAN, YOU'VE DOCUMENTED, THESE

63
00:01:46,135 --> 00:01:47,336
ARE LOVEBIRDS.

64
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:49,138
THEY HAD ALL THIS HATRED FOR THE

65
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:49,972
PRESIDENT.

66
00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:51,073
THEY WERE VERY QUICK TO PUT

67
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:52,141
THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING

68
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:53,276
THAT WAS GOING ON.

69
00:01:53,276 --> 00:01:55,811
YET HERE, YOU KNOW, YOU'LL JUST

70
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:58,214
SEE GAP AFTER GAP.

71
00:01:58,214 --> 00:01:58,915
I'M NOT SATISFIED.

72
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:00,449
>> Sean: OKAY.

73
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:04,036
I WANT TO GO TO DISH

74
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:04,287
I WANT TO GO TO DIS

75
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:04,320
I WANT TO GO TO THS

76
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:04,921
I WANT TO GO TO THE

77
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:04,954
I WANT TO GO TO THE I

78
00:02:04,954 --> 00:02:04,987
I WANT TO GO TO THE ISS

79
00:02:04,987 --> 00:02:05,121
I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE

80
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:05,154
I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE H

81
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:05,288
I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE HOW

82
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:05,321
I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE HOW I

83
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:05,655
I WANT TO GO TO THE ISSUE HOW IS

84
00:02:05,655 --> 00:02:06,656
IT POSSIBLE THAT PETER STRZOK IS

85
00:02:06,656 --> 00:02:08,890
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS?

86
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,158
HE INTERVIEWED FLYNN?

87
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:12,228
HE ALSO INTERVIEWED HILLARY

88
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:12,562
CLINTON.

89
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:14,964
THAT WAS IN JULY OF 2016.

90
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:19,135
IT WAS EARLY MAY OF 2016 WHERE

91
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:21,470
IT WAS STRZOK AND COMEY HIMSELF

92
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,172
WRITING AN EXONERATION THAT

93
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:26,609
ACTUALLY USED THE STANDARD, THE

94
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:28,077
LEGAL STANDARD THAT MEANS

95
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:29,345
HILLARY WOULDN'T HAVE BROKEN THE

96
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,079
LAW.

97
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,280
THEY CHANGED THE WORDING TO TAKE

98
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,517
THAT PART OUT AND THE ORIGINAL

99
00:02:34,517 --> 00:02:37,053
DRAFTING ALSO HAD IN THAT

100
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:38,154
MULTIPLE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE

101
00:02:38,154 --> 00:02:39,789
AGENCIES HAD HACKED INTO HILLARY

102
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:42,692
CLINTON'S E-MAIL SERVER AND THAT

103
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:44,994
MEANS TOP SECRET CLASSIFIED

104
00:02:44,994 --> 00:02:46,095
SPECIAL ACCESS PROGRAMMING

105
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,097
INFORMATION WAS IN FACT OBTAINED

106
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:49,832
BY AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NONE OF

107
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:53,302
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN REDACTED,

108
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:53,569
SIR.

109
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,906
>> SO IF YOU WERE SOMEBODY ON

110
00:02:56,906 --> 00:02:58,174
HILL'S CAMPAIGN TEAM AT THE TIME

111
00:02:58,174 --> 00:02:59,575
AND COULD HAVE SUGGESTED CHANGES

112
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:02,478
TO BE MADE, YOU WOULD HAVE

113
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:03,446
SUGGESTED THE CHANGES THAT PETER

114
00:03:03,446 --> 00:03:05,414
STRZOK INSISTED ON TO TRY TO

115
00:03:05,414 --> 00:03:09,218
REDUCE HILLARY'S LEVEL OF

116
00:03:09,218 --> 00:03:16,392
RECKLESSNESS AND HER

117
00:03:16,392 --> 00:03:16,792
CULPABILITY.

118
00:03:16,792 --> 00:03:18,894
WHAT DOES HE DO AFTER COMEY

119
00:03:18,894 --> 00:03:19,595
EXONERATES HILLARY?

120
00:03:19,595 --> 00:03:21,998
A COUPLE WEEKS LATER, HE OPENS

121
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:23,733
UP A COLLUSION CASE AGAINST THE

122
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,434
TRUMP CAMPAIGN BASED OFF OF WHAT

123
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:28,738
WE NOW KNOW IS A TWO-PAGE

124
00:03:28,738 --> 00:03:29,939
DOCUMENT WITH NO ACTUAL

125
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:30,373
INTELLIGENCE.

126
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:31,974
THEN EVENTUALLY THEY

127
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:33,109
SUPPLEMENTED IT WITH A FAKE

128
00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:35,778
DOSSIER PAID FOR BY THE

129
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:36,145
DEMOCRATS.

130
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,514
BUT STRZOK WAS THE PRIME DRIVER

131
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:40,416
NOT ONLY BEHIND EXONERATING

132
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,218
HILLARY BUT PURSUING THIS

133
00:03:42,218 --> 00:03:44,353
COLLUSION FAIRY TALE AND THAT

134
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:45,855
ULTIMATELY LED TO THE

135
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:47,456
APPOINTMENT OF MUELLER.

136
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:48,791
>> Sean: UNBELIEVABLE.

137
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,959
CONGRESSMAN, WE'RE NOT GOING TO

138
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:50,493
LET UP.

139
00:03:50,493 --> 00:03:53,195
THERE'S APPARENTLY 50,000 OF

140
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:53,929
THEM.

141
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:56,332
APPARENTLY 1.2 MILLION PAGES

142
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:58,934
THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAS

143
00:03:58,934 --> 00:04:00,569
THAT CONGRESS NEEDS TO GET.

144
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,238
AND I'M JUST URGING CONGRESS, IF

145
00:04:02,238 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY DON'T HAND THEM OVER SOON,
