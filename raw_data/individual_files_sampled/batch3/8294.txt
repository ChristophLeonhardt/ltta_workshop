HEAT OF THE DEBATE, AND THAT THERE WAS NOT A QUID PRO QUO. Bret: DAVID LEE MILLER, THANK YOU. SOME MAJOR RULINGS TO TELL YOU ABOUT OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. LET'S GET TO MY COLLEAGUE, AND ANGER AT FOX NEWS AT NIGHT, SHANNON BREAM. FIRST UP, WE HAVE THE COURT ESSENTIALLY TAKING ON THE DISTRICTS IN TEXAS. SO THE QUESTION IS, THE CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS IN PLAY HERE AND ALSO SOME STATE HOUSE SEATS IN TEXAS. WHAT THEY DID FOR THE MOST PART, THIS WILL BE VIEWED AS A WIN FOR THE REPUBLICANS TODAY BASED ON WHAT THE COURT DECIDED. IN A 5-4 RULING, THESE DISTRICTS WILL NOW LEAVE MOST OF THEM HELD HAD A PROBLEM. THIS 5-4 VOTE, THE CRITICS SAID THIS WAS JOAN MIKE DRAWN IN A WAY THAT GAVE MINORITY VOTERS LESS OF A CHOICE, VOICE. THE COURT SAID IT WAS SEND THAT BACK DOWN. Bret: SO THEY ASKED HOW MIKE ALSO TOOK ON ACTION IN THE WE HAVE REPORTED ON MANY TIMES THAT DECLINED TO DO FLOWERS FOR A SAME-SEX WEDDING? Shannon: WE HAVE ALL BEEN WATCHING HER CASE, SHE HAD A LONG TIME CLIENT SHE WAS VERY CLOSE TO BUT WHEN HE ASKED HER TO DO FLOWERS FOR A SAME-SEX WEDDING SHE DECLINED BASED ON HER RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS AND OFFERED TO HELP FIND SOMEONE ELSE. THE MAN POSTED ABOUT IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT'S WHEN THE WASHINGTON STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. HE ENDED THE ACL IN VIEW, NOT THE COUPLE, ARE THE ONES THAT SUIT THE FLORIST. SO THE SUPREME COURT SENT THE FLORIST CASE BACK TO WASHINGTON STATE TO THE SUPREME COURT SAYING, RECONSIDER THAT BASED ON WHAT WE DID WITH THE BAKERY CASE. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS CASE AND WINDS UP BACK IN SUPREME COURT WITHIN A YEAR OR Bret: BUT FOR THOSE FOLKS, THEY SEE OPTIMISM. Shannon: YES THEY DO. Bret: SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR TOMORROW? THESE REALLY BIG DECISIONS THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SPECIFY. PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES WHO SAY THEY DO NOT WANT TO SUPPORT THE UNION'S POLITICAL MESSAGES AND ACTIVITIES. SO AGAIN, WE WILL GET ANOTHER
