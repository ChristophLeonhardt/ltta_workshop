if ever there was doubt of a worsening trade war between the US and China the White House's long-awaited announcement made Monday put an end to the debate it will be a lot of money coming into the coffers of the United States of America a lot of money coming in a lot of money in the form of tariffs on an additional two hundred billion dollars of Chinese imports the US government will begin collecting a ten percent tariff on those Goods starting September 24th through the end of the year then on January 1st the terrorists will jump to 25% and if China at any time retaliates the White House says an additional 267 billion dollars of Chinese imports practically the remainder of all Chinese products sold in the US will also fall under the tariffs the president's view is not to destroy the Chinese economy we're not trying to put him out of business we're trying to get them to join the international trading nations world and be a citizen and abide by the rules for the first time in some 20 odd years prior to the US announcement China's foreign ministry had warned China would indeed retaliate China will have to take necessary countermeasures to defend its own legitimate rights and interests the increased tensions will likely scuttle the renewal of trade talks between Beijing and Washington while about 5,000 Chinese products including household goods from vacuum cleaners to bikes will be targeted many US businesses are expected to suffer as well three out of four American companies are adversely affected by US tariffs and maybe 60% are adversely affected by the Chinese tariffs so the companies and remember these are folks doing business in China experts agree the trade war will not only hurt the US and China but also the global supply chain with the pain likely spread across the world hi Joe Castro al Jazeera Washington
