<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kill Harry the baby and</font>

7
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,000
spare him the agony I think JK Rowling

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,559
has dedicated some time explaining the

9
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,150

climbed a lion in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Traverse Square before</font>

27
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">we had to rectify this</font>

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,380
I then spent the evening with Christina

29
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,060
Charlie and Alex I was persuaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font>

30
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,830
frequency of giggles emerging from

31
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,150
Charlie's room when I arrived at<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

flat coupled with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the persuasive and</font>

33
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:29,410
created charm of Kristina Horner to

34
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,940
begin watching the television program

35
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,770
community I now agree with Christina's

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,660
assessment that it is one of if not the

37
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,060
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> written program on television at</font>

38
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,190
the moment at least on us television and

39
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,720
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> until Aaron Sorkin's annex</font>

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,700
project comes on TV I really want Aaron

41
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,920

45
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,620
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a belated birthday celebration</font>

46
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,660
seven of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us went bowling at the all-star</font>

47
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,970
bowling lanes in London kind of a 50s

48
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,240
retro Americana style bowling alley it's

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,710
really nice there's only five bowling

50
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,790
lanes there's a few of them around

51
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,040
there's three all star lanes and there's

52
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,390
also greens free bowling which does a

53
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,530
similar thing and they gave me a

54
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,880
birthday<font color="#CCCCCC"> card</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i learned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

55
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">night i am very bad at bowling but</font>

56
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,570
extremely good at picking out tasty

57
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,190
cocktails Lex of course pick the

58
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:17,500
cocktail that is so strong you can't buy

59
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,570
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than two were you drinking right</font>

60
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,220
now zombie it was fun we ate pizza

61
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,270
everyone else is quite nonchalant and

62
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,890
melissa is checking her phone so jazz

63
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,510
and everything was great and then

64
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">yesterday I'd say goodbyes Christina</font>

65
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,090
which was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sad because she's kind</font>

66
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,220
of been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the whole process of</font>

67
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,020
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only person was he was</font>

68
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,120
probably around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for more of it was</font>

69
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,070
Ariana weird to kind of not have her

70
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,390
around even though she was only here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

71
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,190
three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy birthday despite the</font>

72
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,810
circumstances would probably be the

73
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,850
stolen phrase that would best some this

74
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,560
week up the emptiness hasn't gone yet

75
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,420
and it was even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more noticeable when I</font>

76
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,820
opened my birthday caught up from my mom

77
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,040
and it didn't have my dad's tiny writing

78
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,570
in it when I didn't hear his voice

79
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,010
seeing the man yanique does in the

80
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,630
morning when my<font color="#E5E5E5"> family came in and woke</font>

81
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,000
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> up as per Mexican traditions a great</font>

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,230
tradition because people bring presents

83
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,880
and then you get open them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in</font>

84
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,340
bed you revenge me of presents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

85
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,560
cards and it's great and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> singing</font>

86
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,840
it was like this very absent voice and

87
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,190
it was extremely noticeable when I

88
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,020
rewatched the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harry Potter film</font>

89
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,640
that he will never see he being the

90
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,140
person who introduced me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the series</font>

91
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,970
when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also the fact that</font>

92
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,470
we've all seen the Harry Potter films

93
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,110
together and over the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> since the</font>

94
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,730
very first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so it was very strange</font>

95
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,680
but I do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say despite the</font>

96
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,540
circumstances<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thanks to friends and</font>

97
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,790
family alike I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very happy birthday</font>

98
00:03:34,819 --> 00:00:00,000
stop that with that camera
