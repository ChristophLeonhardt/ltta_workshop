77
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:50,699
I MEAN, ACTUALLY THE

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,535
INDICTMENT ITSELF HAS THE

79
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,704
WORD IN TURKISH, OF COURSE,

80
00:01:55,705 --> 00:01:56,572
IT'S CALLED

81
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:57,072
CHRISTIANIZATION.

82
00:01:57,073 --> 00:01:59,141
THAT IS THEY VIEW THAT ACT

83
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:00,776
OF RUNNING A SMALL CHURCH,

84
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:03,345
SHARING THE GOSPEL AS AN ACT

85
00:02:03,346 --> 00:02:04,713
THAT WAS AN ACT OF

86
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:05,080
TERRORISM.

87
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:06,548
THAT'S HOW THEY DEFINE IT

88
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:08,383
THIS WAS A TERRORISM CASE,

89
00:02:08,383 --> 00:02:09,083
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

90
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:10,385

94
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,157

DID IN GETTING THIS

97
00:02:17,393 --> 00:00:00,000
ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE FAMILY.
