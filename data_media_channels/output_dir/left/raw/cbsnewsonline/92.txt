00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:06,505
MAKING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. 

2
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:06,805
THANK YOU. 

3
00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:11,010
>> LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY, WE 

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,582
WILL NOT JEOPARDIZE ANY PART OF 

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,015
THIS INVESTIGATION. 

6
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:16,916
HOWEVER, TODAY WE WILL TAKE 

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:22,789
SOME QUESTIONS, BUT NO DETAILS 

8
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,258
WILL BE RELEASED THAT WILL 

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:25,824
JEOPARDIZE ANYTHING. 

10
00:00:25,824 --> 00:00:26,058
SIR. 

11
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:26,525
>>REPORTER:  YEAH. 

12
00:00:26,525 --> 00:00:30,063
CHANNEL 7 HERE. 

13
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,531
HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO RECOVER 

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,164
THE BODIES? 

15
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:34,834
>> AT THIS POINT WE HAVE BEEN 

16
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:39,572
ABLE TO RECOVER A BODY THAT 

17
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:40,306
WE'RE QUITE CERTAIN IS SHANANN 

18
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:40,639
WATTS' BODY. 

19
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:42,542
WE HAVE STRONG REASON TO 

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,778
BELIEVE THAT WE KNOW WHERE THE 

21
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,480
BODIES OF THE CHILDREN ARE AND 

22
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,185
RECOVERY EFFORTS ARE IN PROCESS 

23
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:52,452
ON THAT. 

24
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:53,019
>>REPORTER:  YOU MENTIONED 

25
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:53,252
DARCO. 

26
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:53,686
[ INAUDIBLE  ] 

27
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:56,456
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT. 

28
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,690
>>REPORTER:  HAS HE GIVEN YOU 

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,092
ANY INDICATION AND YOU KNOW AND 

30
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:01,094
I HAVE REPORTED THAT YOU GUYS 

31
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,228
HAVE SPOKEN WITH HIM, HAS HE 

32
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,696
GIVEN YOU ANY INDICATION AS TO 

33
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,498
WHY HE MIGHT HAVE ALLEGEDLY 

34
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,132
COMMITTED THESE CRIMES? 

35
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,333
>> THAT PART, JASON, WE JUST 

36
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,034
CAN'T GET INTO ANY COMMENTS 

37
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:11,337
THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 

38
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,772
MADE BY AN INDIVIDUAL IN AN 

39
00:01:12,772 --> 00:01:13,072
INTERVIEW. 

40
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,074
THAT REALLY WOULD JEOPARDIZE 

41
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:14,340
THE CASE. 

42
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,441
>>REPORTER:  HAS HE BEEN 

43
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:16,109
COOPERATIVE WITH YOU? 

44
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,778
>> I CAN'T EVEN GIVE YOU AN 

45
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:19,812
ASSESSMENT OF THAT. 

46
00:01:19,812 --> 00:01:20,145
I APOLOGIZE. 

47
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,814
>>REPORTER:  DO YOU THINK THERE 

48
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:25,852
COULD BE ANYONE ELSE INVOLVED 

49
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,787
IN THIS HELPING WITH THE BODIES 

50
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,855
OR THAT THERE COULD BE 

51
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:29,288
ADDITIONAL PEOPLE? 

52
00:01:29,288 --> 00:01:30,857
>> WE HAVE AN AWFUL, AWFUL LOT 

53
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,092
OF PEOPLE WE STILL NEED TO TALK 

54
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:33,258
TO. 

55
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:35,228
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, AN 

56
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,563
INVESTIGATION LIKE THIS, IT'S 

57
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:36,830
COMPLEX. 

58
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,097
WE TALK TO ANYONE AND EVERYONE 

59
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:38,932
NO MATTER HOW LOOSELY RELATED 

60
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,366
TO THIS THEY MIGHT BE, AND SO 

61
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:44,170
WE GOT A LOT OF FOLKS WE NEED 

62
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:44,504
TO TALK TO. 

63
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,871
IN TERMS OF -- I THINK IT'S 

64
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,473
SAFE TO SAY THAT IN TERMS OF 

65
00:01:47,473 --> 00:01:49,943
ANY DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY OR 

66
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,945
ANYTHING LIKE THAT, WE'RE NOT 

67
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:57,850
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AT ALL. 

68
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,519
AND SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT. 

69
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,522
>>REPORTER:  THE STATEMENTS BY 

70
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,224

BODIES? 

72
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,492
>> IT WOULD BE A TOTALITY OF 

73
00:02:06,492 --> 00:02:08,228
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A FULL 

74
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:08,895
POLICE INVESTIGATION REGARDING 

75
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,830
ANY MORE DETAILS THAN THAT I 

76
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,263
WILL NOT GIVE OUT. 

77
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,265
>>REPORTER:  DO YOU KNOW WHEN 

78
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:16,102
THEY WERE KILLED MORE OR LESS? 

79
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:20,106
>> THAT I DO NOT HAVE AT MY 

80
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:20,373
DISPOSAL. 

81
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,274
>>REPORTER:  ANY SENSE OF IF HE 

82
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,110
KILLED THEM ALL AT THE SAME 

83
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,912
TIME, DID HE DO IT OVER THE 

84
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:26,679
WEEKEND, CAN YOU TELL US A 

85
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:27,647
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT? 

86
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,948
>> THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE 

87
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,383
MANY DETAILS WE ARE NOT ABLE TO 

88
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,016
DISCUSS AT THIS TIME. 

89
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:34,053
AS I SAID BEFORE, THE CASE IS 

90
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:34,888
STILL ONGOING, THE 

91
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,222
INVESTIGATION IS STILL 

92
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:36,756
CONTINUING. 

93
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:38,625
>>REPORTER:  IS THERE A

TIMELINE BETWEEN WHEN MR. WATTS

WAS ARRESTED AND WHEN THE BODY 

96
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,796
OF SHANANN WAS RECOVERED, CAN 

97
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,765
YOU GIVE US THE DETAIL ON THE 

98
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:46,032
TIMELINE? 

99
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,234
>> I DON'T WANT TO ATTEST TO 

100
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,068
ANYTHING THAT I'M NOT CERTAIN 

101
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:51,905
ABOUT MYSELF OR WOULD 

102
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,472
JEOPARDIZE THE CASE IN THE 

103
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:52,739
MATTER. 

104

>>REPORTER:  THE VICTIM'S

FAMILY ON SOCIAL MEDIA SAID HE 

106
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,275
CONFESSED TO THE MURDERS. 

107
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:56,742
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT? 

108
00:02:56,742 --> 00:02:57,944
>> AGAIN, THAT WOULD BE A 

109
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,646
DETAIL I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 

110
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:00,146
DISCLOSE AT THIS TIME. 

111
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,213
>>REPORTER:  CAN YOU TALK MORE

ON YOUR OFFICERS, ON THE TEAM? 

115
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,054
>> OH, ABSOLUTELY. 

116
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:12,191
THAT IS A QUESTION I CAN'T 

117
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:15,762
ANSWER, AND IT'S BEEN EARTH 

118
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:16,095
SHATTERING. 

119
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:16,829
OUR SMALL DEPARTMENT, 20 PLUS 

120
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,298
OFFICERS, WE'VE BEEN WORKING 

121
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,266
AROUND THE CLOCK ON THIS, AND 

122
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,301
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN 

123
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:22,001
WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY, 

124
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,305

THEMSELVES, OBVIOUSLY THE MEDIA 

127
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:29,442
AND IT'S BEEN NONSTOP. 

128
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,878
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY THERE'S 

129
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,146
NO END IN SIGHT, BUT IT'S 

130
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:33,579

DISCLOSE ANYTHING ABOUT THE 

140
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:48,928
PERSONAL LIVES. 

141
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,530

LAST NIGHT AT OUR REQUEST BY A 

148
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:02,708
DISTRICT COURT JUDGE. 

149
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,477
WE DID SO SO THAT WE COULD 

150
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,480
FINISH UP A FEW OF THE 

151
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:07,947
INVESTIGATIVE STEPS. 

152
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,382
MY ANTICIPATION IS THAT ON OR 

153
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,783
ABOUT MONDAY WHEN WE MAKE A 

154
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,552
FILING DECISION MY HOPE WILL BE 

155
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,786
THAT WE CAN ASK THE COURT TO 

156
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,487
UNSEAL THAT INFORMATION AND 

157
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,322
MAKE IT A PUBLIC RECORD AT THIS 

158
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:17,757
POINT IN TIME. 

159

SHANANN WAS CHRIS TALKED TO US, 

162
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,565
HE WAS THE LAST ONE THAT SAW 

163

HER AT 5:00 A.M. 

164
00:04:26,965 --> 00:04:28,201
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE YOU KNOW 

165

OF THAT KNOW OF THE LAST PLACE 

166
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,938
OR TIME THAT SHE WAS SEEN

PHYSICALLY BY SOMEBODY OTHER 

168
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:34,973
THAN THE SUSPECT? 

169

>> AGAIN, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO 

170
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,878
SAY THAT THAT'S, YOU KNOW, ALL 

171
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,080
PART OF DEVELOPING A TIMELINE 

172
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,215
IN A CASE LIKE THIS. 

173
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,483
WE HAVE MANY, MANY PEOPLE TO

TALK TO. 

175
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,151
SO ANYTHING THAT YOU HEAR LIKE 

176
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:46,452
THAT, YOU KNOW, CERTAINLY 

177
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,022
THINGS THAT WE CHECK INTO, BUT 

178
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:52,091
THEN WE ALSO TRY TO VERIFY AND 

179
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,994
TALK TO OTHERS AND REALLY 

180
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:55,661
COMPLETE THAT TIMELINE AS BEST 

181
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:55,894
WE CAN.
