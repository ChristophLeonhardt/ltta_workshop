THAT. WE SHOULD GET THAT ON THE SHOW. KEEP SENDING US YOUR THOUGHTS, FRIENDS@FOXNEWS.COM. THE FIRST REAL FAIR I EVER WENT TO WAS WITH GOVERNOR MIKE HUCKABEE. WE WANT TO BRING HIM IN NOW PETE: I THINK HE REMEMBERS THIS. ABBY: I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER THIS, BUT YOU WERE IN CHARGE OF THE GOVERNORS' ASSOCIATION, AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I MET YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. I BELIEVE IT WAS IN ARKANSAS, YES, I DO, ABBY. AND I REMEMBER THAT YOUR DAD AND I IN IOWA PLAYED WITH R EXO SPEEDWAGON, BECAUSE YOUR DAD IS AN AMAZING KEYBOARD MARE, AND I'M A MEDIOCRE BASS PLAYER. I REMEMBER, THE BEST STATE FOOD FAIR IS PORK CHOP ON A STICK AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR. NORMALLY YOU GO TO THESE THINGS AND YOU JUST TAKE A BITE FOR THE CAMERAS AND YOU KIND OF PASS IT ON, AND THAT'S IT, ONE BITE. I TOOK ONE BITE OF THAT, IT WAS SO GOOD, AND THEY STARTED TO TAKE IT AWAY THERE ME. I SAY TOUCH ME AND I KILL YOU. GRIFF: IT IS REALLY GOOD. I CAN ATTEST TO THAT. THE GOVERNOR IS TELLING THE TRUTH. AND PEOPLE LINE UP JUST TO GET THAT IOWA STATE FAIR PORK CHOP. IT IS A SERIOUS THING. ABBY: AND PEOPLE ALSO LINE UP, GOVERNOR, FOR THESE BIG RALLIES THAT WE ARE SEEING THE PRESIDENT DO. HE IS REALLY GETTING THE GEAR, GETTING US ALL IN GEAR FOR THE MIDTERMS. HE WAS IN TAMPA EARLIER, IN PENNSYLVANIA, LAST NIGHT IN OHIO, AND HE REALLY A TAKES THE TIME, GOVERNOR, TO REMIND HIS BASE WHY THEY VOTED FOR HIM, WHY HE IS THE PERSON THAT IS FIGHTING FOR THE THINGS THAT THEY CARE MOST ABOUT, AND THAT IS THIS COUNTRY. HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT PREDICTING A RED WAVE. HE SAID WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT A BLUE WAVE COMING, AND THIS IS WHY I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A RED WAVE. HERE'S A BIT OF WHAT HE SAID LAST NIGHT. OH, I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE THAT. BUT YOU WERE WATCHING, WE WERE ALL WATCHING IT, GOVERNOR. WHAT WERE THE HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU? YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT DONALD TRUMP IS DOING AND HE'S DOING INCREASES, IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO AN ECONOMY THAT NO LONGER IS CHUGGING ALONG WITH 4.1% GDP GROWTH AND GO BACK TO AN ANEMIC, JUST STRUGGLING ECONOMY, VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS. IF YOU WANT A GOVERNMENT THAT MOVES US MORE TOWARDS SOCIALISM, MORE TOWARD THE IDEA OF YOU WORKING HARD AND GIVING IT TO SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T WORK AS HARD AS YOU DO, VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. IF YOU WANT A NATION AND A WORLD THAT'S NOT AS SAFE, THAT HATES COPS, THAT WANTS TO SURRENDER AND BOW DOWN TO FOREIGN LEADERS, VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS. AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANYTHING THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD DO MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN WHAT HE'S DOIING AND THAT'S GOING OUT THERE. AND IT DRIVES THE MEDIA PEOPLE NUTS, IT DRIVES THE ELITISTS BUT IT'S RALLYING THE PEOPLE AND REMINDING THEM WHY HE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN NOVEMBER OF 2016. GRIFF: AND, GOVERNOR, THE PRESIDENT'S OUT THERE RALLY ARING FOR, ALSO, TROY BALDERSON, DO YOU FEEL LIKE HE'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT THERE? ENDORSEMENT BECAUSE IT CALLS ATTENTION. SOMEBODY, BUT MAYBE A PERSON THAT JUST WASN'T ON THE RADAR OF PERSON, MAYBE I SHOULD BE TOO. AND WE'VE SEEN THE INFLUENCE IN KEY RACES. MARTHA ROBY IN ALABAMA COMES TO MIND, THERE ARE SOME OTHER RACES WHERE I THINK HE'S PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN BOOSTING THE CANDIDATE AND GIVING THEM THE PUSH OVER THE FINISH LINE. PETE: ABSOLUTELY. WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE ABOUT LAST NIGHT WAS THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA, AND PART OF THE REASON HE TALKS ABOUT IT IS THEY FAIL TO TELL THE WHOLE STORY, OR THEY TELL ONE SIDE OF THE STORY AND PRETEND IT'S UNBIASED. ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS "THE NEW YORK TIMES," WHICH THE PRESIDENT CALLS THE FAILING NEW YORK TIMES. THERE WAS AN OP-ED THAT CAUGHT OUR EYE, IT TALKED ABOUT THE CHILDREN AT TRUMP RALLIES. IT SAID WHAT IS IT LIKE TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE EXPOSED TO SO MUCH PHOTOGRAPHER. SO THESE POSITING THAT THESE KIDS AT THE RALLY THAT GO WITH THEIR PARENTS, THEY'RE BEING THEY'RE IN A BAD SPOT. YOU'VE HAD KIDS GO TO PLENTY OF RALLIES. WHAT DOES IT DO HOW DOES IT AFFECT KIDS? DONALD TRUMP RALLIES ARE INCREDIBLY PATRIOTIC, THEY'RE UPLIFT ARING. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO AN ARKANSAS/LSU GAME? YOU WANT TO SEE SOME TENSION, SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP YOUR KIDS AWAY FROM, THAT OUGHT TO DO IT. WHY DON'T WE TAKE OUR KIDS TO THAT OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT PUTS YOU IN A SOOTHING MOOD. I MEAN, GOOD HENS. "THE NEW YORK TIMES" GOOD HEAVENS, THE NEW YORK TIME THE IS EMBARRASSING ITSELF. THEY JUST HIRED A COP-HATING PERSON TO BE ON THEIR EDITORIAL BOARD, AND THEY EVEN HAVE THE AUDACITY TO DEFEND IT. FOR THEM TO COME OUT AND TRY TO SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE ABOUT THE TONE OF DONALD TRUMP IS ABSOLUTELY LAUGHABLE. THEY ARE MAKING A JOKE OF THEMSELVES, AND I DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF DOING THAT THAN THEY ALREADY HAVE DONE. ABBY: GOVERNOR, THE BATTLE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND MEDIA, IT SEEMS TO ONLY GET HOTTER AND HOTTER. HE SLAMS THEM EVERY TIME. HE POINTS BACK BECAUSE HE KNOWS THEY'RE STANDING RIGHT THERE, AND THEY CAN'T RESPOND, PEOPLE, DISGUSTING, CALLS THEM OUT BY NAME. DO YOU THINK THIS IS HELPFUL IN THE LONG RUN, OR IS HE MAKING THEM THE STORY? WELL, THEY SHOULD NEVER BE THE STORY. I MEAN, PERSONALLY, I WOULD PREFER THAT HE SPENDS MORE TIME IGNORING THEM BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THEY MATTER THAT MUCH TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN VOTER. AND I THINK HE'S GOT TO DISTINGUISH THE FACT THAT NOT ALL THE PRESS ARE THE ENEMY OF BEST THING WE HAVE IN A DEMOCRACY. OF IT'S CRITICAL TO OUR SURVIVAL. BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN, THE PRESS NEEDS TO ACT WITH SOME LIKE THE GUY ON CNN WHO ENJOYS BECOMING THE STORY, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, WHENEVER A JOURNALIST BECOMES PART OF THE STORY, IT'S NO LONGER A NEWS BECAUSE THE BEST JOURNALISTS ARE THE ONES WHO SIMPLY DUI YOU THE GIVE YOU THE FACTS, AND THEY REALLY ARE NOT PART OF THE STORY AT ALL, THEIR VIEWS, THEIR OPINIONS, THEIR BIASES ARE SUBJUGATED TO THE FACTS THEMSELVES AND LET THE READER OR THE VIEWER MAKE THE DECISION. THAT'S NOT HAPPENING VERY MUCH ANYWHERE IN JOURNALISM TODAY. PETE: YEAH. AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S POINTING OUT. IT'S BEEN A DOUBLE STANDARD FOR ANOTHER HALLMARK OF THE LEFT HAS BEEN THE USE OF IDENTITY POLITICS AND THE USE OF RACE AND GENDER AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION AS THE WAY OF CLASSIFYING SOMEONE. WELL, KAMALA HARRIS, WE ALL KNOW IS ON THE 2020 LIST, SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA. SHE TOOK THAT HEAD ON, AND WE WANT YOU TO REACT. LISTEN. THAT PHRASE, IDENTITY AND IT IS USED TO DISTRACT. IT IS USED TO TRY AND SHUT US UP. THESE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DIMINISH AND DEMEAN ARE THE VERY ISSUES THAT WILL DEFINE OUR DEFINE OUR IDENTITY AS AMERICANS. IN KAMALA HARRIS' WORLD, IN THE WORLD OF MOST OF THE LEFTIST DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE THE CLEAREST EXAMPLE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CONSERVATIVE AND A LIBERAL, AND HERE IT IS: CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE THAT OUR BASIC FORM AS A NATION IS BUILT AROUND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY, THAT I'M PERSONALLY FREE AND I'M PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MY FREEDOM. IN, WHETHER IT'S MY GENDER, WHETHER IT'S MY RACE, WHETHER IT'S MY SOCIOECONOMIC STANDARD, AND THAT I'VE GOT TO STAY IN MY GROUP. IF MY WHOLE GROUP DOESN'T ADVANCE, I CAN'T ADVANCE BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT THE GROUP, NOT THE THE RIGHT, THERE IT IS. DO YOU BELIEVE IN INDIVIDUAL BELIEVE THAT WE'RE PART OF GROUP THINK. AND IF YOU THINK THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE GROUPS AND YOU STAY IN YOUR CORRAL AND DON'T LEAVE UNTIL THE WHOLE HERD OF SHEEP GO OUT, WELL, FIRST OF ALL, YOU'RE A LIBERAL. SECONDLY, I HOPE YOU LIKE WHERE YOUR HERD IS, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING OUT. I'M GRATEFUL TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT LET ME GET OUT OF SOME OF THE CORRALS THAT I WAS PUT IN AS A CHILD, YOU KNOW, IN TERM THE OF POVERTY, IN TERMS OF NEVER THINKING I'D GO 50 MILES FROM MY HOME. I GREW UP BELIEVING THAT IN AMERICA YOU CAN DO ANYTHING, BE ANYTHING IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK HARD, GET AN EDUCATION AND NOT GO AROUND CALLING YOURSELF A VICTIM. THANK GOD I LIVE IN AMERICA, AND I'LL BE GRATEFUL EVERY DAY FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY PRIVILEGE OF BEING INDIVIDUALLY FREE. ABBY: THAT IS VERY WELL SAID, GOVERNOR. GRIFF: THANK YOU, GOVERNOR, BECAUSE NOW I'M HUNGRY FOR THAT FLASHBACKS TO THE FAIR WE WENT TO WITH REO SPEEDWAGON. I WAS A BACK-UP SINGER SINGING GO, JOHNNY GO. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? I WISH WE HAD VIDEO TO PROVE IT. TOM VILSACK PLAYING THE SPOONS, GOVERNOR OF IOWA AND A GREAT FRIEND OF OURS. HE WAS THE HOST GOVERNOR, SO THEY GOT HIM UP ON THE STAGE, AND HE DIDN'T PLAY AN INSTRUMENT, BUT HE PLAYED THE SPOONS. I FELT BAD FOR HIM BECAUSE THE DES MOINES PAPER EXCORIATED HIM FOR SAYING HE HAD HUCKABEE ON
