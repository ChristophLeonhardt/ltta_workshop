00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
would be there it was really close to my

house it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 10 minute walk from my</font>

13
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,029
lovely space it has all sorts of amazing

14
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,710
really great selection of books actually

15
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,900
the best created young adult section

16
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,170
there is in the UK I think and it's just

17
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's quite small it's all on one</font>

18
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,640
floor but it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> fun space and I</font>

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,960
remember going<font color="#E5E5E5"> there as a child's as</font>

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,450
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roald Dahl open the shop in 1977</font>

21
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,059
and he is the first in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> furthest away</font>

22
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:44,309
on the big war photographs<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the many</font>

23
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,079
many many events they've had in that

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,940
shop my two sisters are also on that

25
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">wall and a black and white picture next</font>

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,239
to Rolf Harris and yeah so there are so

27
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,860
many greats up there but today I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

28
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,629
very sad news something I'd suspected

29
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:56,070
for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also something that had</font>

30
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,629
apparently been in denial about the

31
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:59,129
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> time as well because I got really</font>

32
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:00,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">upset when I found out that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

33
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happening that the line and you</font>

34
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,719
know comfort shop will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> closing and in</font>

35
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,220
August that's what they thinks it's

36
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to talk about to other</font>

37
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:07,290
people because a lot of people don't

38
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:09,630
really understand what space is to you

39
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,040
and in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it can be really hard to</font>

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,380
convey this or formative aspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> a place</font>

41
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that and your first job especially</font>

42
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,740
can have in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> life I used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bio</font>

43
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,320
babysat before that but I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

44
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">like my first proper job it's just so</font>

45
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,640
sad and it's such a loss for southwest

46
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,799
London and for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> London really and</font>

47
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,240
that shop has so many partnerships with

48
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,430
so many schools and when I was there

49
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,619
that was what I really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> learnt to</font>

50
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,670
read critically into I don't know find

51
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,530
what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about a certain book it makes</font>

52
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,420
you love it and to put that into words

53
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,390
in a way that shot really trained me for

54
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,430
being able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> books on here I</font>

55
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,259
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them before in a sort of</font>

56
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,990
vague way and I mean sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I relapse</font>

57
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,290
into that now but it just it made me

58
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,909
want to share books with people more

59
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">than anything and before like reading</font>

60
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,600
had been kind of a solitary activity

61
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,329
that kept myself and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much felt</font>

62
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,969
that these books for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my books and I</font>

63
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:04,320
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really would share them and</font>

64
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,780
reading was my thing but working that

65
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,060
bookshop really showed me<font color="#E5E5E5"> how important</font>

66
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,440
it is to share that love of reading

67
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,690
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's with someone</font>

68
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,430
who is a reluctant reader or someone who

69
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,740
loves reading as much as you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

70
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,510
there's a real joy to be found in that

71
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,070
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person somebody came with the</font>

72
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,430
street or an aspiring author or a

73
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,040
celebrity they all kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a looking for</font>

74
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that book that will grab them and that</font>

75
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,730
to me was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> appealing and then of</font>

76
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,170
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key role of my Muslim</font>

77
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,610
people would come in asking for Twila

78
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,230
and say you might think you want do I

79
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,110
like what you actually want is X Y Zed

80
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,790
but then I also have caused games from

81
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,200
the copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> of twilight they requested</font>

82
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,970
because you know customer service<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

83
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,250
in that book shop that I got this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

84
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,110
was in that book shop that I got this

85
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,300
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking with rascal especially was</font>

86
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,340
entirely on a recommendation I came in

87
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,400
after school<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and spoke to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you one of</font>

88
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watched the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bookshop you</font>

89
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,850
later became colleague of mine and it

90
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,260
was on the recommended read shelf but

91
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,330
she said<font color="#E5E5E5"> you absolutely must read it and</font>

92
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,740
it's that thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss</font>

93
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,900
so much we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> lack that so much when</font>

94
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,830
we eventually push independent bookshops

95
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:11,580
and real like handcent<font color="#E5E5E5"> book shops out</font>

96
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,500
the picture and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose</font>

97
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,320
people like Tony you worked at the line

98
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,720
unicorny were hood you felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he'd</font>

99
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,480
read absolutely everything he knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

100
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,430
what you were looking for and he talks

101
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,110
about it he talks about books in a way

102
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,820
that make you feel like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

103
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,800
magical there's really something to be

104
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,330
discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

105
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,130
there's any element of fantasy in them

106
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,480
then there's people like John who works

107
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,800
there as well you find this amazing

108
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,170
gritty teen reads but also finds this

109
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,200
fun junior fiction venture stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

110
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,709
really good sense of humor dhone about

111
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,810
dragon detectives was Margaret who's

112
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,840
like queen of team alongside<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean as</font>

113
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,880
well who loves the dystopia in the

114
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,100
fairyland and then Jenni who's owned the

115
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,690
shop after all this time minutes and

116
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,930
it's hard so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I so sad to me</font>

117
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,910
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going I feel sad about this</font>

118
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,950
and I felt about when we sold our house

119
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,780
like the house I grew up in the house

120
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my parents are in for like 30 years</font>

121
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,730
I feel so much sadder about this book

122
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,110
shop closing<font color="#CCCCCC"> than I thought about that</font>

123
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that might sound terrible to say and</font>

124
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,519
like I'm sure that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people would</font>

125
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,100
be confused about that but to me it's

126
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,769
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a huge loss because I know</font>

127
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,478
that other kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to move into</font>

128
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:23,520
my house you know and like there's

129
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,380
another family living

130
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,510
there now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dagenham an amazing time</font>

131
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,770
there it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be part of their</font>

132
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,570
memory and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I take comfort in</font>

133
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,820
that but in fact that kids aren't going

134
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have the lining eunuch around and the</font>

135
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,880
fact that teenagers aren't gonna be able

136
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,250
to wander in it and find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing</font>

137
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,920
out of book and you know it just is so

138
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,740
sad to me however<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's guess I'm really</font>

139
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,080
self-serving now but I have put up more
