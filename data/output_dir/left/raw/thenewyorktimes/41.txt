00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,960
In 2007 charlie bit my finger became one of the most watched youtube videos ever

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:15,150
Everyone saw this video from your fun aunt to Osama bin Laden

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,539
And it launched a whole genre of Internet content

4
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,480
Parents unexpectedly capturing their kids doing hilariously

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,349
adorable things

6
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:33,689
Adults have always been captivated by kids. Duh. They are cute

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,829
But as the internet

8
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:39,689
professionalized the cute kid genre morphed into something new

9
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:47,759
Now the Internet is producing kid makeup artists kid power eaters and kid parody music video stars

10
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,429
And then there are kids whose parents just film everything they do

11
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,658
One of YouTube's most popular channels is run by the Shaytards a YouTube family of seven that lives by the motto

12
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,769
But most of the time life is pretty boring

13
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,070
watermelon hat

14
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:23,759
In order to make a living on YouTube you have to push out content really consistently, but that content also needs to be

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,600
exciting for

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,580
YouTube family that means making normal everyday life into something that feels

17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,869
Sensational and no YouTube couple has pushed the limits of the family genre more than Sam and Mia

18
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:44,609
The first time Sam and Nia Rayder went viral was in 2014 when they installed a dashcam on their minivan

19
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,629
Dubbed themselves the good-looking parents and lip synced a song from frozen

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,890
the second time Sam in the year went viral was when Sam

21
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:58,199
Extracted Mia's pee from an unflushed toilet and then announced his wife's surprise pregnancy

22
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,840
to her

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,069
At least that's what they said happened

24
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,619
This is the part where I try to think of what's not so bad about this trend

25
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,679
Okay, so these family vloggers show the messy negative parts of parenting

26
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,739
Not just the idyllic cutesy stuff

27
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:31,150
They've helped to open up

28
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:37,920
Conversations about infertility and miscarriages that are often taboo in the mainstream and some parents have always treated their kids like commodities

29
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,899
But on the Internet that impulse can be blown up and popularized on a massive scale

30
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:51,750
the result is that childhood itself is being molded to YouTube's expectations if the traditional baby photo album

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,030
Crystallizes the warmest loveliest moments of a person's young life the YouTube algorithm

32
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,479
Seems to be drawn to the extreme highs and lows

33
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,359
Cuteness is fine

34
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,759
But embarrassment also works

35
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:12,419
Baby fails is now its own thriving at YouTube genre and if you want your own famous YouTube, baby

36
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,899
It would be really convenient if your kid failed like every day

37
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,989
In one particularly disturbing YouTube sub-genre

38
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,759
Parents dress up their kids like their babies and have them suck on pacifiers and fake poop in diapers

39
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,910
At least I think it's fake I

40
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:42,089
Hope it's fake at its most extreme this genre teeters on the edge of abuse

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,420
we put things on the internet that should not be there the parents behind Daddy of five a YouTube channel where they habitually

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,960
Played horrifying pranks on their kids were convicted on misdemeanor

43
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,550
counts of neglect of a minor after the videos came to the attention of Child Protective Services

44
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,479
We just kept going more and more for the shock factor

45
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,080
versus

46
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,910
Reality and to see what could get more views actually

47
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,510
but even kids who aren't outright terrorized on these channels don't have the same rights that traditional child performers do

48
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:20,340
The protections of child labor laws or something like the Coogan Act which saves child actors earnings in a trust until they reach adulthood

49
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,799
These kids don't even get the respite of a distinction between performance and life

50
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:33,599
They're being raised to seek validation by a moding on cue and being taught that that's what family is for back here smile

51
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,940
Say something on the blogs, that means performing a lot of emotional labor

52
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,219
maybe before you even know what emotions are when bogging and

53
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,520
Filming we don't cry

54
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,279
The Raiders youngest child Juliette has been famous since she was born Truman Show style

55
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,089
Her birth has been seen 14 million times

56
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:05,309
Now she's just 2 years old, but she's already experienced a lifetime of drama

57
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:15,649
We don't yet know what that means for a child's development just that millions of other parents and kids are watching

58
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,509
Hey, this is Amanda, this is Shane he edits the videos

59
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:24,348
She writes the videos you watch the videos and if you like the videos

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:30,529
