Center right now is one of anxiety and
excitement everyone feels it that
tonight might be a very historic night

hours into Trump's election night party
in midtown Manhattan people who can come
into this party expecting a lot this
room is a lot smaller than Hillary
Clinton's room the crowds a lot smaller
than Hillary Clinton's crowd but as the
hours have gone on and the results have
started to come in there's been a real
change in atmosphere here a real sense
that maybe something could happen
so we're talking about the county
everybody's Hall we should get some
sleep
