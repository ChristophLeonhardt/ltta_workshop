00:00:11,377 --> 00:00:12,445
AWARE WHEN YOU WERE WORKING

10
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,314

TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT

16
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:24,324
THAT.

17
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,426
>> I HAVE DISCUSSED PUBLICLY

18
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,194
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS

19
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,830
EARLY MAY APPROACH TO ME BY

20
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,965
A FORMER GOVERNMENT

21
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,299
CONTRACTOR IN THE NATIONAL

22
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,934
SECURITY ARENA WHO THROUGH

23
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:38,905
AN INTERMEDIARY TRIED TO GET

24
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,774
TO ME AND TELL ME THAT THE

25
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,342
NSA HAD HILLARY CLINTON'S

26
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,643
EMAILS AND THAT WE COULD GET

27
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,378
AHOLD OF THEM IF WE WANTED

28
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,112
THEM.

29
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:47,580
AND THIS CONVERSATION

30
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,715
CONTINUED FOR A COUPLE OF

31
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,015
WEEKS.

32
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,450
AND I EVENTUALLY TOLD THEM I

33
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,319
HAD NO INTEREST BECAUSE I

34
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:53,420
THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE

35
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,688
CLASSIFIED MATERIAL AS A

36
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:57,724
FORMER ARMY VETERAN WHO HELD

37
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,259
A TOP SECRET CLEARANCE I

38
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:04,197
KNEW THAT WAS FRAUGHT WITH

39
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:06,499
PERIL.

40
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:07,200
>> Tucker: YOU BELIEVE THAT

41
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,903
WAS A TRAP TO LURE YOU IN TO

42
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,704
COMPROMISING THE TRUMP

43
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,304
CAMPAIGN IN SOME WAY.

44
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,641
>> I WILL TELL YOU WHAT,

45
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:15,575
TUCKER, FOR TWO YEARS I

46
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,309
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT AS.

47
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,677
I GAVE IT TO THE SENATE

48
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:18,511
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND

49
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,145
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATORS

50
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,380
WHEN I SAT WITH THEM TWO

51
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,581
WEEKS AGO OR THREE WEEKS

52
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,015
AGO.

53
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,550
AND THEY DIDN'T SEEM THE

54
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,551
LEAST BIT INTERESTED.

55
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,485
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK

56
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,186
OF IT.

57
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,554
TWO YEARS I SCRATCHED MY

58
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:28,021
HEAD.

59
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:29,623
THE INTERMEDIARY OLD FRIEND

60
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,123
OF MINE.

61
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:31,391
WE TALKED ABOUT IT OVER

62
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,892
DINNER DOZENS OF TIMES.

63
00:01:32,892 --> 00:01:34,127
WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT

64
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:34,694
IT WAS.

65
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,530
THEN THE NEWS CAME OUT ABOUT

66
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,368
THE SPY LATCHING ON TO

67
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,103
MEMBERS MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP

68
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,504
CAMPAIGN POLICY COMMITTEE.

69
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:46,206
A LIGHT BULB CAME ON IN MY

70
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:46,640
HEAD.

71
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,041
IF THIS WASN'T A DANGLE OF

72
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:52,879
SOME SORT FROM WHATEVER FBI,

73
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,947
WHATEVER THIS WAS STRAKE

74
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,281
ENOUGH WHERE YOU NEEDED TO

75
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,616
BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC.

76
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,451
I KNEW THE INVESTIGATORS

77
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,419
WEREN'TED

78
00:01:59,419 --> 00:01:59,986
WEREN'T INTERESTED IN IT.

79
00:01:59,986 --> 00:02:00,854
THEY AT THIS POINT IN TIME

80
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:02,322
TAKE NOTES WHEN I TOLD THEM

81
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,023
ABOUT IT.

82
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:03,890
>> Tucker: MAY I STOP YOU

83
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,158
THERE REALLY QUICK?

84
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,126
I'M CONFUSED BY THAT.

85
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,193
THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE TO THE

86
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:08,127
HEART OF THE TOPIC THAT

87
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:10,330
MUELLER IS PURPORTEDLY

88
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:10,764
INVESTIGATING.

89
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,098
>> RIGHT.

90
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:12,732
>> Tucker: CONSUMING ALL

91
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,667
THIS MONEY AND ATTENTION

92
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,134
INVESTIGATING.

93
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,635
WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE

94
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,569
INTERESTED IN HEARING MORE

95
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:16,970
ABOUT THAT?

96
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,404
>> RIGHT.

97
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,872
IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAD

98
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:23,843
HILLARY'S EMAILS IN EARLY

99
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,111
MAY WHEN THIS GOVERNMENT

100
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,046
CONTRACTOR WAS TELL US WE

101
00:02:26,046 --> 00:02:29,783
COULD GET THEM WHY AREN'T

102
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,517
THEY INTERESTED.

103
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,484
I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU

104
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,952
THAT'S WHAT SET OFF A RED

105
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:33,653
FLAG FOR ME.

106
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,021
THEY DIDN'T SEEM THE LEAST

107
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,089
BIT INTERESTED AT ALL.

108
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,357
THEY DIDN'T EVEN TAKE NOTES.

109
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:42,262
I OFFERED THEM THE TIME LINE

110
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,530
I WAS READING FROM IN MY

111
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,198
VIEW AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE

112
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:45,532
IT.

113
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:46,232
>> Tucker: THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

114
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:46,633
REMARKABLE.

115
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,801
WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING YOUR

116
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:49,069
PERSONAL STORY FOR A NUMBER

117
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,103
OF MONTHS NOW.

118
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,171
AND YOU GOT SUCKED INTO

119
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,006
THIS, I THINK, AND IT'S

120
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,374
TURNED YOUR LIFE UPSIDE

121
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:54,674
DOWN.

122
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,842
DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE MORE

123
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,613
CONTACT WITH MUELLER'S

124
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,046
INVESTIGATORS?

125
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,081
>> I BROUGHT THIS TO THE

126
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,148
PUBLIC JUST IN THE LAST

127
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,083
COUPLE OF DAYS.

128
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:03,984
THERE IS ANOTHER APPROACH TO

129
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,819

ORGANIZED BY THE

136
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,128
INVESTIGATORS.

137
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:15,895
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ON

138
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:16,596
TELEVISION BECAUSE THE

139
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:17,497
MUELLER TEAM WANTED TO TALK

140
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,099
ABOUT IT SO MUCH SO MUCH

141
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,533
THAT THEY SOUNDED LIKE THE

142
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,167
AUTHORS OF IT.

143
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,936
I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT

144
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:23,870
WITH THE DOJ OFFICE OF

145
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,738
INSPECTOR GENERAL.

NOW THAT THAT I KNOW THEY

PRESIDENT POSITIVELY AND

149
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,109

THE FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY

161
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,152
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR WHO

162
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,421
CAME TO ME THROUGH

163
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,122
INTERMEDIARY IN THE FIRST

164
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:44,724

00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,028
THE LAST HALF OF MAY.

167
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,563
MY ATTORNEY IS WRITING A

168
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,032

00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,205
>> Tucker: I HOPE YOU WILL

173
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:58,872
BE.

174
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:00,373
BECAUSE, UNLIKE MUELLER'S

175
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:00,974
INVESTIGATORS, I AM

176
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:01,441
INTERESTED.

177
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:02,142
MICHAEL, THANK YOU.

178
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:02,676
GREAT TO SEE YOU.

00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,147
THAT WANT TO GO IN AS WELL.

182
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:07,948
THEY ARE ASKING FOR

183
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,116
SUBPOENAS SO THEY CAN GO AND

184
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,584
TALK TO THE IG ABOUT WHAT

185
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:11,518

00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:12,252
OFFICE AT THE FBI.

187
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,420
THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT MEN

188
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,355
AND WOMEN WHO ARE LYING

189
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,255
AGENTS AT THE FBI WHO WANT

190
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:16,890
TO TALK.

191
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,425
I WANT THEM TO KNOW IF THEY

192
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,291
ARE WATCHING THEY DON'T HAVE

00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:20,793
TO WAIT FOR A SUBPOENA, I

194
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,028
