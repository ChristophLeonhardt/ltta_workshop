00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh human it√µs so I am a major introvert</font>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:05,400
so why do I make videos on the internet

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,940
haha it's because well I get my fix of

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,580
talking to you I'm actually completely

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,740
alone I suspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because you spend</font>

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,929
your free time alone watching people

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:17,880
talk to themselves you may be an

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,279
introvert too bad byeeeee but in case

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,710
you're not let me explain some things

10
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,500
unlike people i enjoy human interaction

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,380
in fact I even get lonely sometimes

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,689
however extended periods of interaction

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,700
kind of wear me out and trying to

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,890
socialize with more than maybe two

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,840
people at a time can be completely

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,450
overwhelming to illustrate take my

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">co-workers everyone I've ever worked</font>

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,290
with in my department has been an

19
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,030
extrovert how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply to work</font>

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,640
where I do like many places you take a

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,860
personality assessment even though I

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,719
always kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fudge those because for</font>

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,100
whatever reason people think that

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,559
introversion is a negative trait this

25
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,010
test still knew my true nature so with

26
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,530
my extroverted coworkers I can go to

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,140
work and I can spend the day talking

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,150
with them and laughing and interacting

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,979
and joking around go to meetings we

30
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,110
lunched together i genuinely enjoy their

31
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,640
company but when people want to go to

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,890
happy hour after work I'm like but

33
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:16,650
didn't we just spend like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire day</font>

34
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,900
together already I mean I have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

35
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,450
being alone to do right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I get home</font>

36
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,159
and my husband<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an ensure it</font>

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,490
gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and we just kind of sit by</font>

38
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,110
ourselves for a while until<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're ready</font>

39
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be around people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again but it's</font>

40
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,259
interesting because a lot of people that

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:32,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">I meet actually don't believe that I'm</font>

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,530
an introvert and I think that's because

43
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,680
I insist on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a strength not that</font>

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,140
I can't talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

45
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,720
prefer not to I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> need time to</font>

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,090
go away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be alone and process things</font>

47
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,460
other than just shouting out ideas in a

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,600
large group setting but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,159
that the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with are</font>

50
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,460
stronger for it call me quiet or shy or

51
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,470
loner but I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that I'm just</font>

52
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,869
fiercely independent it's just who you

53
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,549
are you don't have to be sorry about it

54
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,770
but don't let it be an excuse for things

55
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,640
either so go for it and continue doing

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,110
