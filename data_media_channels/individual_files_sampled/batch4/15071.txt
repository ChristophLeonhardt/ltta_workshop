I don't think it's impossible for conservatives to regain Hollywood again and be involved in the arts and moviemaking Hollywood has always been political but it wasn't always liberal you live here yes maybe you know what a zombie is when a person dies and is buried seems a certain voodoo priest who will have the power to bring him back to life it's worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own you see them sometimes walking around blindly with dead eyes following orders not knowing what they do not caring you mean like Democrats the right has been effective in translating entertainment into votes ever since Louie B mayor turned his studio MGM into a political tool for Republicans in the 1920s taking pictures of Calvin Coolidge on set in 1924 raising money and delivering radio addresses for Republicans in 1928 in return President Herbert Hoover rewarded him with an overnight stay at the White House in 1929 Ronald Reagan was a staple in the Hollywood creating Western movies he reached the heart of voters most significant Reagan's rise to the presidency reinforced the belief that entertainment mattered and this belief is the authority that conservative and liberal entertainers draw on today yes the most outspoken celebrities in Hollywood tend to support liberal causes but there are conservative entertainers such as James Woods Kevin Sorbo Tim Allen who advanced Republican goals Scott Baio even spoke at Trump's GOP convention in 2016 in the 1920s and 30s most of the studio heads were Republican who spent a lot of time trying to block unions and guild organizations a number of protest groups had successfully lobbied Washington and federal government was looking to impose censorship guidelines on the studio's rather than losing control of their product and face the involvement of the government the motion picture producers and distributors of American hired Warren Harding's Republican Postmaster General will Hays to address the problem that's when the Hays Code was implemented where they were really careful about the amount of and sex stuff involved in movies so that's why those old-fashioned movies they always just phase out when they're about to kiss and things are very subtle with sexuality in them there was a list of do's and don'ts that they had to abide by but this list started to get phased out and people started doing whatever they wanted anyway Gary Cooper Ronald Reagan Robert Taylor and other figures expressed concern over liberal content in their scripts Hollywood began to slowly liberalize by 1962 the production code was virtually toothless the newly formed Motion Picture Association of America implemented a rating system which still stands today in 1969 following the release of Easy Rider directed by liberal turned conservative Dennis Hopper counterculture films began to appear in significant numbers by the mid-1970s older directors were retiring and new generations of filmmakers were emerging by the late 1970s Hollywood was very openly and specifically liberal after making his last film in 1965 Hollywood director John Ford saw the writing on the wall Hollywood now is run by Wall Street in Madison Avenue who demand sex and violence author tag Gallagher quotes him as writing in his book this is against my conscious and religion so I don't think it's totally out of line for conservatives to be ruling Hollywood again we have in the past we created the industry liberals like always take it over change it make it seem like it's their thing and push us out but not anymore I think it's time we regain our stance in Hollywood if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
