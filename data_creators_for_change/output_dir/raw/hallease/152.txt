cuz it's got a really simple compact

20

design the power cord itself even

21
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,430
becomes more compact and manageable you

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,590
just flip it through there's a natural

23
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,700
groove in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power strip that holds the</font>

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,549
