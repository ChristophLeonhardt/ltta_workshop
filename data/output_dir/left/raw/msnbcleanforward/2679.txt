GOING TO RULE THIS ONE A SUICIDE.

24
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,555
SUICIDE. IT IS SELF-INFLICTED.

25
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,856
IT IS SELF-INFLICTED. IT’S MORALLY REPUGNANT.

26
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,658
IT’S MORALLY REPUGNANT. IT’S A STAIN ON THE HISTORY OF

27
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,659
IT’S A STAIN ON THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY AND ON THIS

28
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,059
THE COUNTRY AND ON THIS PRESIDENCY.

29
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:40,897
PRESIDENCY. I THINK THIS IS A DISASTER, ANDI

00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,599
I THINK THIS IS A DISASTER, ANDI AT LEAVE 70 TO 100 CONGRESSIONAL

EVEN IN BASE DISTRICTS, THIS HAS PEOPLE OUTRAGED.

34
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,905
PEOPLE OUTRAGED. THESE ARE NOT REPUBLICAN VALUES.

35
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,306
THESE ARE NOT REPUBLICAN VALUES. THESE ARE NOT AMERICAN VALUES.

36
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,308
THESE ARE NOT AMERICAN VALUES. THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE A BIG

37
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:51,975
THIS ONE IS GOING TO BE A BIG PRICE TO PAY.

38
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,510
PRICE TO PAY. YOU CAN SEE THE POLITICAL

39
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:55,712
YOU CAN SEE THE POLITICAL MACHINERY WORKING AS THE SENATE

40
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,215
MACHINERY WORKING AS THE SENATE IS IN JUST ABOUT FULL REVOLT

41
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:01,351
IS IN JUST ABOUT FULL REVOLT NOW, AND THE HOUSE WHICH IS MORE

THERE’S TREMENDOUS ENERGY TO GET OUT OF THIS THING, BUT A LOT OF

45
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,490
OUT OF THIS THING, BUT A LOT OF DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE.

46
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:08,025
DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE. IF THEY MOVE VERY QUICKLY, THEY

47
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,593
IF THEY MOVE VERY QUICKLY, THEY CAN AMELIORATE SOME OF IT.

48
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:11,328
CAN AMELIORATE SOME OF IT. >> I WAS THINKING ABOUT A MEMBER

>> RIGHT. >> I’VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST HIM

56
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:20,137
>> I’VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST HIM AT ALL.

57
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,139
AT ALL. YOU AND I COULD SIT DOWN WITH A

58
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,774
YOU AND I COULD SIT DOWN WITH A LAPTOP AND GARAGE BAND AND MAKE

59
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,143
LAPTOP AND GARAGE BAND AND MAKE A SPOT RIGHT NOW THAT COULD HELP

A SPOT RIGHT NOW THAT COULD HELP TO DEFEAT HIM IN NOVEMBER USING

61
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:29,380
TO DEFEAT HIM IN NOVEMBER USING JUST THIS ISSUE.

62
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,147
JUST THIS ISSUE. >> YEAH.

00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,085
GUYS IN THE TOUGHEST DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST

66
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:35,519
ARE GOING TO BE THE FIRST CASUALTIES.

67
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,920
CASUALTIES. THAT’S KIND OF THE CRUEL IRONY

68
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:37,455
THAT’S KIND OF THE CRUEL IRONY OF THIS.

69
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:38,956
OF THIS. BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FOLLOW

70
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:40,758
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FOLLOW YOUR PRESIDENT OFF A CLIFF OF

BEHAVIOR, YOU’RE GOING TO PAY A POLITICAL PRICE, AND THAT’S

76
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,267
POLITICAL PRICE, AND THAT’S WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN.

77
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,836
WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN. >> WHAT IF THE DEMS ON THE LEFT

78
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,471
>> WHAT IF THE DEMS ON THE LEFT HAD THEIR ACT TOGETHER?

79
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,071
HAD THEIR ACT TOGETHER? >> MM-HMM.

80
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:54,572

85
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,078
THING, YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE A POLITICAL GENIUS.

86
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,947
POLITICAL GENIUS. YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT AND THIS

87
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:05,182
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT AND THIS POLICY HAS MANAGED TO OFFEND THE

88
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,650
POLICY HAS MANAGED TO OFFEND THE WHOLE COUNTRY ON A DEEP,

89
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:07,185
WHOLE COUNTRY ON A DEEP, FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL.

90
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:09,487
FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL. SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE A

91
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:10,988
SO YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE A POLITICAL MACHIAVELLIAN TO PUT

92
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,989
POLITICAL MACHIAVELLIAN TO PUT TOGETHER THE CAMPAIGN.

93
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,090

94
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,291
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE OUT WANTING TO PUNISH THE PARTY FOR

95
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:14,726
WANTING TO PUNISH THE PARTY FOR THIS.

THE NEXT WAVE WILL BE WE’RE GOING TO SEE IT ON TODAY.

98
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:18,996
GOING TO SEE IT ON TODAY. WE’RE NOT JUST GOING TO HEAR

99
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:21,499
WE’RE NOT JUST GOING TO HEAR AUDIOTAPE OF A KID SCREAMING FOR

100
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,900
AUDIOTAPE OF A KID SCREAMING FOR HIS OR HER MOTHER.

101
00:02:22,944 --> 00:02:24,168
HIS OR HER MOTHER. WE’RE GOING TO SEE IT.

102
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,703
WE’RE GOING TO SEE IT. THEN THERE WILL BE THE

103
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:26,671
THEN THERE WILL BE THE INVESTIGATIONS, RECRIMINATIONS.

104
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,805
INVESTIGATIONS, RECRIMINATIONS. THE PRESIDENT BEING THE

105
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:28,906
THE PRESIDENT BEING THE PRESIDENT WILL DIG IN.

106
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,808
PRESIDENT WILL DIG IN. TODAY IT WAS A CASE STUDY IN

107
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,475
TODAY IT WAS A CASE STUDY IN NON-PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP.

108
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,711
NON-PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP. HE WENT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE,

109
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,113
HE WENT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE, THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE, AND

110
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:37,782
THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE, AND SAID, I’M FOR BOTH BILLS, KEEP

111
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:38,182
SAID, I’M FOR BOTH BILLS, KEEP FIGHTING.

112

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,117
>> AND DIDN’T HERE A PEEP IN OPPOSITION.

114
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,419
OPPOSITION. >> QUIETLY THEY’RE ALL

115
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:41,786
>> QUIETLY THEY’RE ALL HORRIFIED.

116
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,820
HORRIFIED. THE SENATE WILL MOVE FAST, AND

117
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,721
THE SENATE WILL MOVE FAST, AND THEY WILL FOLLOW.

118
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,889
THEY WILL FOLLOW. THE LEGAL PROBLEM IS IT’S A

119
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:46,991
THE LEGAL PROBLEM IS IT’S A LITTLE TRICKY TO FIGURE OUT HOW

120
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:48,392
LITTLE TRICKY TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE CONGRESS CAN MICRO MANAGE

121
00:02:48,403 --> 00:02:49,427
THE CONGRESS CAN MICRO MANAGE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT.

122
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,428
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. LAMAR ALEXANDER IN THE SENATE IS

123
00:02:50,438 --> 00:02:50,728
LAMAR ALEXANDER IN THE SENATE IS RIGHT.

124
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:51,862
RIGHT. THE PRESIDENT COULD STOP THIS

125
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,431
THE PRESIDENT COULD STOP THIS THING IN AN HOUR, YOU KNOW, WITH

126
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,232
THING IN AN HOUR, YOU KNOW, WITH ONE PHONE CALL.

127
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:55,433
ONE PHONE CALL. AND CLEARLY HE DOESN’T WANT TO

128
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:55,934
AND CLEARLY HE DOESN’T WANT TO DO THAT.

129
00:02:55,944 --> 00:02:57,302
DO THAT. HE WANTS TO PLAY A POLITICAL

130
00:02:57,312 --> 00:02:58,703
HE WANTS TO PLAY A POLITICAL GAME THAT ULTIMATELY IS GOING

131
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:01,439
GAME THAT ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO, YOU KNOW, MASSIVELY HURT THE

132
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,073
TO, YOU KNOW, MASSIVELY HURT THE PARTY HE’S ALLEGEDLY FOR.

133
00:03:02,117 --> 00:03:04,642
PARTY HE’S ALLEGEDLY FOR. AND YOU THINK HE DIGS IN MORE

134
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:05,510
AND YOU THINK HE DIGS IN MORE BEFORE A BREAKING POINT OR A

135
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,010
BEFORE A BREAKING POINT OR A TIPPING POINT.

136
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,646
TIPPING POINT. >> >> I THINK HE’S A TODDLER.

137
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,981
>> >> I THINK HE’S A TODDLER. PUSH AND HE THROWS A TANTRUM.

138
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:10,849
PUSH AND HE THROWS A TANTRUM. HE WANTED TO TALK TODAY ABOUT

139
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:13,618
HE WANTED TO TALK TODAY ABOUT MARK SANFORD AND TAKE SOME

140
00:03:13,628 --> 00:03:14,653
MARK SANFORD AND TAKE SOME VICTORY LAP OVER A PRIMARY.

141
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,353
VICTORY LAP OVER A PRIMARY. IT’S INFANTILE.

142
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:16,688
IT’S INFANTILE. I THINK HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND

143
00:03:16,731 --> 00:03:17,922
I THINK HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT’S HAPPENING HERE OR HE

144
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,224
WHAT’S HAPPENING HERE OR HE DOESN’T CARE.

145
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:20,158
DOESN’T CARE. YOU’VE GOT PEOPLE LIKE

146
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:21,860
YOU’VE GOT PEOPLE LIKE LEWANDOWSKY WHO IS ON PENCE’S

147
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,961
LEWANDOWSKY WHO IS ON PENCE’S PAYROLL OUT MOCKING THESE

148
00:03:22,971 --> 00:03:23,295
PAYROLL OUT MOCKING THESE PEOPLE.

149
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,463
PEOPLE. I MEAN THIS IS NOT ONLY TONE

150
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:25,763
I MEAN THIS IS NOT ONLY TONE DEAF.

151
00:03:25,774 --> 00:00:00,000
DEAF. THIS IS MORALLY DEFICIENT, AND A
