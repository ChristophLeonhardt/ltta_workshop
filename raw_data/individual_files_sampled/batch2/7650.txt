Blasi ford in today's hearings there were a number of reactions from Republican lawmakers that were fascinating and honestly unexpected given the partisan politics that play a role in this whole debacle now there were Republicans who said yeah this her testimony is absolutely credible for example there was a Senator Richard Shelby from Alabama Richard Shelby the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee called Christine Blasi Ford's testimony on Thursday credible he said quote I thought the prosecutor looked like she knew what she was doing I don't know how it plays out I said let's see how this process works now you know that was a statement specifically about the prosecutor in this case but the prosecutor by her own admission by the way was unable to poke any holes in dr. Blasi Ford's testimony toward the end of the questioning she made it clear that uh you know it's these five-minute intervals of questioning that make it very difficult for me to do what I'm supposed to do and that was essentially an admission of a failing to find any holes in the story that Blasi Ford was sharing with her there was orrin hatch so Orrin Hatch attempted to comment on how credible the testimony was however he used wording that some found controversial when reporters asked hatch to elaborate on what he meant by attractive and good witness you know his aides essentially said attractive meant attractive testimony not her physical appearance he said she seems very sincere but in terms she seems very sincere but in terms about her and Kavanagh I don't really know any more other than she can't remember how she got there and how she left and that's a to Lindsey Graham that is not Orrin Hatch's comments and to me I know there's a controversy around Orrin Hatch calling her attractive and and pleasing is was his explanation of what he meant by attractive and people are really upset about that because they think especially for a sexual assault survivor those are not the right words to use to me the more relevant part as to whether he found her believable or not is he said I didn't find her uncredible right wait so in other words even Orrin Hatch who when the hearings began was the most vituperative against her and and had said all the charges are phony and when asked how he knew that he said I just know okay comes out and says basically yeah she was credible so again the idea of questioning whether this happened to her is pretty much done at this point only kook's on fox news and on social media are still talking about how she's lying or you know in the words of one of them as skank right but but but the Republicans in Kavanagh have said no mas we don't dispute this happen to her exactly and so there was also an interesting thing that happened with Senator Lindsey Graham following dr. Blasi Ford's testimony this is when they finally went to recess and so Lindsey Graham was approached by reporters and he he seemed to belittle her testimony he seemed to say that he didn't really believe her now let me give you one of those quotes unless something new comes forward you have just an emotional accusation and an emotional denial without corroboration and then he was approached by someone who identified herself as a rape victim and according to reporters this woman just told Lindsey Graham that she was raped he said as he headed into an elevator I'm sorry tell the cops it does not seem like a particularly caring response for God's sake take a minute to just you know give a proper response and then and then move on but Lindsey Graham full of a lot of anger today as he just showed later in testimony but but Cavanaugh's testimony is a different question but Blasi fors testimony was pretty much as good as her supporters could have asked for in terms of making her case and watching her and hearing her makes a huge difference it's way more effective than seeing it in in cold print in front of you it's one thing to see the quotes it's another thing to see and connect to a human being telling a story and it was so powerful it broke through through even to the Republicans now they might not vote in the right direction anyway they might vote for Kavanagh even if they believed her and I guess they're gonna hang their hat on yeah she's definitely telling the truth about everything except that it was Kavanagh mm-hmm but but overall she was an excellent witness like what you see click this subscribe button below and don't forget to ring the bell to never miss another video from the Young Turks
