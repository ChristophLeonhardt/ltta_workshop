can arabs solve their problems their leaders meet for yet another summit if millions of Arabs remain caught up in wars and conflicts from Syria to Palestine and Yemen what can these leaders offer and do these summits serve any purpose at all this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Rochelle Carey leaders of the Arab world or in Saudi Arabia for the annual Arab League summit yeah it's a state are discussing a wide range of issues from the wars in Yemen and Syria it is riyals role in the UN Security Council but they're also clear about what they will not be talking about the airstrikes by the US UK and France in Syria are not on the agenda nor is the GCC crisis and the saudi-led blockade on Qatar the king of Saudi Arabia opened the summit with these words the Palestinian cause remains our paramount issue and it will remain as such until our Palestinian brothers achieve all their lawful rights chiefly the establishment of an independent state with East Jerusalem as its capital we renew our rejection and denounce the decision made by the US administration on Jerusalem and we further reiterate that all the states reject such decisions emphasizing that East Jerusalem is an integral part of the Palestinian territories first topic up for discussion at the Arab summit was US President Donald Trump's plan to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem he made the controversial announcement at the end of last year calling Jerusalem the capital of Israel Yemen is also on the table with the UAE and Saudi Arabia heavily involved in the war and the humanitarian crisis there there will be mention of the war in Syria but not the recent airstrikes several member states including Iraq if call for quick solutions to the conflict there is no representative from Syria at the meeting though Syria has been suspended from the league since the war began and 2011 let's bring in our guests now joining us from Gaza Luc heimer Abu Saud oppressor professor that is a political science at al Gaston University in Gaza and in sana Hakim alma smari editor-in-chief and publisher of the Yemen Post gentlemen thank you very much for joining me so let's start with something that is technically not supposed to be on the agenda but that's actually my question the recent airstrikes in Syria the leaders of the Arab summit have already said that's not something that is going to be on there agenda Machamer how does that strike you that something like that is not technically going to be discussed here and what does that say to you about the role that these leaders see in helping develop some sort of future for Syria well I believe there are two explanations for this one is that the Arab summit has been scheduled from a long time ago and it was supposed to be held at the end of March and it has been postponed for mid-april now and the attack against Syria just took place just yesterday so maybe that is one of the reasons for for not putting this issue on the djinn on the agenda and second there is definitely a very deep differences among Arab leaders and Arab governments with regard to these attacks by the US administration against Syria I believe we veered from some of the Arab leaders some of them who have supported these attacks against Syria and some of the Arab leaders who were cautious with regard to these attacks and they were calling for restrain and for the unity of the Syrian territory and they will constrain that these attacks will probably destabilize the region and cause more tension and frankly friction in the Middle East region how can what do you make of the fact that the reports are that that leaders of many of these countries that the Arab summit weren't given any type of heads-up that these airstrikes are going to happen in Syria it's an embarrassment the rachelle never before in the last hundred years have the air has been so divided like they are today in the past they had somewhat of a unified agenda today they cannot do that because their enemy their threat is from within the Arab League is because the nations are fighting themselves of the war in Syria the war in the Yemen the political tension in Egypt in Libya in Somalia are all involved with Arab nations so the the enemy is now from within in the past forget the Arab League the GCC itself was a united front even though the Arab League was weak today that's a different case there are nations like that who are not attending the the Arab summit so not the Arab League but also the GCC and the list goes on and the division does not end with a political tension a rather war that is being raised the air strikes on Syria the other day two days ago over a hundred airstrikes just two days before the summit this is a clear embarrassment of they have no influential no involvement in trying to end this so the meeting is it's said that there it's being held today and with their heads raised up as if the Arab nations are living years of prosperity forgetting the the humanitarian crisis that's pouring on many nations the airstrikes that are bombarding countries like Yemen in Syria the attacks from within the political tension and they're still meeting as if nothing had happened and threatening Oh blue putting the blame or scapegoat on Iran instead of trying to solve their problems Yemen is right next door to Saudi Arabia okay the the blame is to Iran and not Yemen because Iran is a powerful nation occasion so Saudis attacking Yemen and not Iran okay let me jump in for just a minute cuz you actually brought in a lot of issues that we are going to address but I want to bring in now who's I'm gonna join the conversation Sammy not our director of the LaVon Institute for strategic affairs and Sammy thank you so much for joining us I want to bring you into the discussion that we're having about Syria and to the point that he made I asked him you know the reports are that the the leaders at this summit most of them were not eat really none of them actually were told we're given a heads up about this airstrike in Syria is something that that clearly on some level affects them what does that say to you that they weren't and what role do the leaders here play in the future of Syria when a lot of them are not even on the same page about it first of all keep in mind that the Arab League has suspended Syria a membership in 2012 so why because most of the Arab League countries are at odds with the Syrian regime and the regime of Assad in particular and when it comes to the strike it's not the first strike I mean this is a sanction ad it has been done one year ago and the process was put in place when the agreement were reached between the Russian and American so this act is mostly came as a response to an agreement that was not honored and this is the western version mainly the American version of it and the president Trump said it very clearly blaming Russia for not putting enough pressure on Assad or two to respect the non use of chemical weapon and he named Russia responsible for this secondly it behind this chemical attack there is definitely a message that the West's want to send to Russia so it's more a Russian Western affair than something that deals with a political settlement in Syria now yes mr. Trump hinted to the to the Geneva process today France or yesterday France called for a more active role of the United Nation a leading role in order to push for a settlement in Syria and I expect the Arab League today to push into the same direction in this case yes definitely the Arab countries should be a consulted and as it was put by the Egyptian president today during the the summit the Arab or the main concerned with what's happening in sea and it's after all and before all in that affair so look Homer what about that I mean to Sammy's point Syria has been isolated and suspended from the league for years now in the past few years at least the opposition was in fact brought in invited to the summit they're not this year and there's so much division among the countries there about what they even think about Syria having said all of that isolating Syria has not worked what what role do these countries play in some sort of solution to Syria what definitely it's a very important issue which has been brought by Sammy that Syria's membership in the Arab League was suspended in the year of 2012 after the eruption of the Syrian civil war which erupted after March 15 of 2011 when the Arab Spring erupted in a number of Arab countries and yes Syria has been isolated and has been boycotted by many Arab countries and many Arab regimes but I believe that there are a number of Arab countries who are insisting in bringing back Syria again to the membership of the Arab League I believe there are about 10 Arab countries who are calling for the for bringing Syria back because Syria has managed to survive the past seven years of civil war and also Syrians ability to to defeat the so-called terrorists or Isis in in a number of areas in the Syrian territory and with the support of the Russians and the Iranians for the Assad regime it seems to me that it doesn't make any sense to neglect these military facts or these political facts in in Syria and that's why there are calls for bringing Syria back to the Arab League now whether that is going to happen in future Arab summits or not but at least there is still a big division among the Arab leaders with regard to the Syrian civil war and with regard to also to the US airstrikes against Syria we all have healed from a number of Arab countries who supported the US airstrikes against Syrian army and there are Arab countries like Egypt who were hesitant to support such airstrikes and calling for restraint and that that such airstrikes will will will cause a further destabilization in Syria and in the Middle East but but overall overall I believe I believe that this is one of the most contentious issues that is facing the Arab leaders and in this summit and definitely maybe maybe this Arab summit will will will cause will even deepen the division among Arab leaders an arab government okay let's pivot to the issue that is apparently going to be the leading issue at the summit King Salman already referenced it obviously that being the Palestinians and specifically he spoke of u.s. Donald Trump declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel and but this is something that the Saudis had not done before there's been not a lot of pushback against the the announcement that Donald Trump may Hakeem let me bring you into that why why is that that there hasn't been more pushback and what does that say to the Palestinians sadly the Palestinian civil war or occupation is now sidelined because of the Arab nations dividing between themselves of Israel series that's it's the best time to act as if pleases and I don't blame them I don't blame the smart for being smart I blame that dumb for being dumb or the if someone is not doing his job as a political leader then I can't blame the other the enemy of for being smarter than him Palestine today is is a lost case so whatever happens in the summits won't even help listen ins there are even sites or governments within the Arab League who are coordinating with Israel before the summit itself it's an embarrassment if I was an Arab leader I would I would be forced to come maybe but I would at least cover my face while attending the meeting for Yemen for example um three years we're entering we entered a fourth year of war all of us because to to return president Hadi back to power and until today he's still living in Saudi Arabia after three and plus years he's still living in Southie yes he has an easy trip to the summit but it's an embarrassment that all these crises are not being solved whether it's in Yemen and Palestine and Syria all of these countries will face lost cases division from within so I don't have no idea why the Arabs are even meeting just to ensure to the world that we are more divided that you than you think that's the message that's okay we have divided we're very much divided okay let me put that to Sammy Sammy do you agree with a pretty gloomy picture that came is painting of of the the lack of unity at the Arab summit and the fact that he says that the Palestinian cause is a lost cause the lack of unity is not a new thing rarely the Arab League got a unified position on some issue maybe with the exception of the Palestinian issue they have a unified position though they don't have a unified strategy but most of the Arab countries agreed and are supporting the strategy of what we call the Arab initiative in 2002 which is the Arab Peace offer that consists in to the peace in return of the land or the land in return of peace more exactly however what we call the axis of resistance the Syria and a non Arab country Iran is having a different strategy a strategy of control think Israel even at-at-at one country level or two country level not seeking a unified position and this has weakened arab position today for for most of the arab countries at least the GCC countries and even egypt when we hear the speech of President Sisi today the main concern is Iran they see Iran as the major threat it's at the expense definitely of other important issues like the Palestinian issue like the Syrian people rice I mean let me ask you today the number one so to that point so are you and how to confront Iran are you saying that you think that putting that much attention on Iran I mean you can't walk into chew gum at the same time but it seems like you're saying that you think that too much energy is being put into Iran at the expense of other things is that what you think yes and definitely today that there is there should be a new dynamic more efforts put towards pushing this Arab initiative because in my view this is the best way to counter America decision to word Jerusalem because the United State what I have done unfair move but if we can put it in this way they have to give to the Palestinian what they gave to the Israeli they gave only on one hand and they kept the other hand a closed the one that should have given something to the Palestinian and the best way to push America towards more more opening to the Palestinian is once again to push for this Arab initiative and I won't be surprised that this will be the number one issue today at at the Arab summit but I mean if you put yourself in the shoes of the Saudi Arabia for instance when the Saudi soul is like targeted who see missile and they are accusing directly Iran of equipping those who see with this missile it's normal that their number one concern that most of their effort are deployed in order to fend off the Iranian influence in the region that took a great advantage for the last during the Obama year and yes it could took advantage of Obama decision to unilaterally withdraw from Iraq look I'm are holy because they fill the void okay more who do you who is to blame for this lingering conflict in Yemen and the humanitarian crisis and the fact that that Saudi is hosting the summit do you think there's going to be any real brutal honesty in the discussions about what's going on there considering their role in bombing Yemen well if you could just allow me to respond to what was mentioned by Hakim earlier about the Palestinian cause as a lost cause I think it's too early and premature to say that the Palestinian cause is a lost cause yes there is a Palestinian internal division which has been going on for more than ten years now but that doesn't justify at all to say that the Palestinian cause is a last rose is a lost cause I believe that the Palestinian people have paid heavy casualties over the past 70 years and especially since the Israeli occupation of West Bank Gaza is Jerusalem in 1967 and the Palestinian people are willing to do whatever it takes to put an end to this Israeli occupation and settlement expansion restore their national unity and established a Palestinian independent over their occupied territory now going back to your question and who is responsible for this lingering in the oven and now unfortunately what is happening in Yemen is part of the Arab internal division it's part of the Arab rivalries and especially the perceived threat from the Iranians in the region is I think the major cause for this lingering position in in Yemen and now it's no secret that Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates are leading a war in Yemen to try to contain the Iranian shared threat in the in Yemen and also in the Gulf region and also to stop the Houthis from making further advances in Yemen now though I do want to bring her came into this because Yemen is his area of expertise and I want to I want to bring him into this and I want I want to put that question to you the Saudi Arabia is hosting this summit Saudi Arabia is bombing Yemen it is creating one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world is there going to be any real brutal honesty there about what is happening and what to do about it he came there will be a lot of blaming and finger-pointing yeah again when I said that Palestine is a lost case I'm not saying it's some happiness it's sad that but I'm being realistic that this is what the Arab countries are witnessing today and living today Yemen for example before in the previous summits at least the Arabs were trying to solve their problems in the last couple of years it's not solving anymore it's just trying to find a scapegoat or fingers to blame that who is the reason for example Iran they are being blamed for Yemen I have no doubt that they are involved in supporting the Houthis some way or the other but again what three years of war three plus years of war and there has been no advancements over the last 19 to 20 months there hasn't been the President himself was still living in reality there is no success story in any of the cities that have been controlled by the coalition so people were hopeful that the Coalition might come and help him and but there hasn't been that in Yemen and that's why people are losing hope that this war is supposed to take long the international community or the international powers in coordination with the Gulf countries mainly Saudi and the UAE are purposely trying to make human war continued longer longer the humanity doesn't care it doesn't say that again about continuing to go ahead yeah the idea it's not trying to end the war as I said earlier 20 months of war in Yemen there has been very very little 5 to 10 kilometers of success for any side so it's been a complete stalemate there hasn't been no development major development in the Yemen war both sides are doing and still made so it mostly mean is now believe that this war is supposed to take long the agenda is for the Yemen war to continue and not to be solved there is no success story for any city that has been taken over or controlled by the saudi-led coalition support the government there's no success story this clashes everywhere there's are human rights violations every day assassinations happening in those cities so this war is supposed to take long Yemenis are convinced that it's not in Saudis hands anymore Saudis just a reason to have this work continue longer longer for other side interests that are involved by the test community so there's no hope for Yemenis to end this war not because peaceful peace is not there's no place for peace but because there's no real willingness to end this war because of the major international entrants that are developing and will be continued to develop over the next couple of years and Yemen has to continue to be divided in order for the interest of continual okay so we will have to see how all of these really important issues are actually addressed at the summit gentlemen thank you all for joining me Sammy
