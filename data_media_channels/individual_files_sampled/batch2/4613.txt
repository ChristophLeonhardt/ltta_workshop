joining us now Tim O'Brien the executive editor of Bloomberg view the author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald he's an MSNBC contributor also as Curt Anderson who's the author of the book Fantasyland how America went haywire and Jennifer Rubin is joining us a conservative opinion writer at the Washington Post and an MSNBC contributor and Jennifer before I get to my Trump scholars here who've been studying him for decades I wanted to start with you on on the dimensions of this lie that the president told today because here we have 17 dead in Florida and certainly more than 17 families wondering what might have been what could have been how could this have been different and for the President to insert himself and say if only Donald Trump were there if only Donald Trump were there your child might be alive today for him to insert himself into that grief with this ugly fantasy is is such in my view such a vile violation of the grieving that is going on in Florida something only Donald Trump would be capable of it is always about Donald Trump to even the death of 17 people including a number of children is always about Donald Trump the truth be told of course he's a five-time deferred wannabe he has to equate going to boarding school or avoiding sexually transmitted diseases to his own Vietnam he is afraid of blood he's afraid of sharks he's afraid of germs he's afraid of Vladimir Putin he's afraid of Robert Muller this is a man who is deeply deeply insecure deeply damaged and so I think he makes up for with this ridiculous pompous boasting that really no one probably even he does at some point believes it but it is galling and it is particularly galling because in the job he is elected to do we don't ask that he run into buildings we simply ask that he'd be true to the United States that he stand up for America that he stand up to our enemies that he take a stand a foreign power for example metals our election and even that he cannot do so regardless of whether he thinks he could run into a building or he doesn't think he could run into a building the man is a coward he will always be a coward he wasn't his personal life and he has been as president and as far as he tries to spin his way out of that that's a reality I think that most Americans in their hearts no Tim don't rubs hid behind lawyers his entire life including and dealing with you and other reporters and and so I I don't think there's anyone other than the most the people who have absolutely no connection to fact who can imagine Donald Trump doing what he said he would do today but his ability to step into the grieving process that's going on in Florida and in a larger sense around the country and say you know this could have been completely different if I was there this is not a new performance by Donald Trump you know in the 1980s two of his casino executives were killed in a helicopter crash on their way to Atlantic City and he was interviewed the day of the crash I believe about how he felt about it and what the loss of the executives meant to him and he turned the whole thing into a yarn about how he just missed getting on the helicopter and thank goodness because if he had been on that helicopter he would have died too and rather than consoling the families or talking about the service that these executives had provided to his company he sat around and talked about himself and you're seeing this repeated again with with the Parkland shootings rather than get into the nuances of gun control or or go out of his way to involve himself with grieving families and traumatized students he uses it a moment for self-aggrandizement and this is in keeping with the way he's always rolled and I think in the moments when he's most of the time when he's boasting he's boasting about things he's most deeply insecure about I'm worth 10 billion dollars I'm a really rich guy when he's not I'm a really smart guy I went to Wharton when he's not particularly bright and I'm a superhero I'd run into a building when there's gunfire to save all the students when I don't think he'd get anywhere near any of it Kurt one of the defenses you were seeing for the president up until today when he started calling the officers who did not go in cowards was there was there was some people were offering the defense well the Trump isn't saying that he would have gone in himself well now he is and and now the defense the subsequent to that is he's not saying he would have saved the day but that just he would have gone in well for but of course he's saying he would go in which as you're suggesting is among his many many lies in his life it's among the most preposterous and anybody who has any sense of not just him of reality and what anybody as you say without a child there would do who isn't a police officer running in unarmed it's ridiculous so there are those people as you say who will continue to support and believe him because they are his true believers and and and can accommodate any fantasy to keep that up but let's remember what he said about his true believers when he was running for president they would support me even if I shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue that's how shooting has come up in his various fantasies before is he could shoot somebody they'd still love me well he can say he would go in there unarmed and and into the hail of semiautomatic weapons fire and I guess they'll still believe him and he's got a point and Jennifer the brave Donald Trump is already backing away from what he said he was willing to do on gun legislation after having lunch with the NRA yeah wouldn't you know Donald Trump always wants to be the hero I never can quite bring himself to do it so he did the same thing on dreamers he loves dreamers he's gonna take care of the dreamers he then threatened to veto the only bill that possibly could have spared them deportation he really wants to do something about guns he's really gonna do it he feels terrible let's have lunch with the NRA and forget about it so he can always play the hero he always wants to be the star but he never has the guts he never has the tenacity to go against his party wacky bass he never has the nerve to stand up to people who he perceives as powerful and said he surrounds himself by people who are powerful and he completely misunderstands the whole notion of valor remember poor Jim mattis had to talk him in out of resuming a policy of torture because that's what Donald Trump thinks soldiers do he has no conception that American soldiers are bound by the laws of war and the laws of the United States similarly he won't likes to be around police officers he told them oh go ahead rough up some of your suspects he has no idea that police officers the vast vast majority of them taking oath and behave in exemplary fashion so Donald Trump is always trying to be one of the guys he's always trying to be the hero but he never can be because he is not made of stuff he is an empty damaged soul and you know if he was a decent person I might care about it frankly our only care is that this behavior is damaging to the country and and frankly appalling for a President of the United States who is supposed to exemplify at least some decent qualities and Tim quickly before we go I know a number of you authors who have written about Trump closely have examined his family relationships and there's some dispute about how long Donald Trump jr. went without speaking to his father I know that the author of the art of the deal suggests as a very significant period of time and and the Trump was very content his notion of dealing with his own kids was just if they want to come to the office and watch me work that's okay but he was he would brag about not bothering to take me for walks he wasn't around he was not a hands-on father with any of his kids he's not a hands-on father now really with Barron and it was left to his wives to have to I think pick up the remnants of the day and make sure the kids got to school got fed were attended to that wasn't his thing you really didn't engage with any of his kids until they got to college we're gonna break it there on this one Curt Anderson Tim O'Brien Jennifer Rubin thank you all for joining us tonight really appreciate it hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC
