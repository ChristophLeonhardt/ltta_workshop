LEGALLY. EVERYBODY HERE IN SAN DIEGO TRYING TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. I'M JAMIE CHAMBERS. FOX NEWS. Martha: SHORT WHILE AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED, "THE MIGRANT CARAVAN THAT IS OPENLY DEFYING OUR BORDER SHOWS HOW WEAK CAN EFFECTIVE USE IMMIGRATION LAWS ARE. YET JON TESTER VOTED TO PROTECT CENTURY CITIES. WE NEED LAWMAKERS WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST. ELMA." THE PRESIDENT GOING AFTER JON TESTER FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING THE RONNIE JACKSON SITUATION. HERE WITH JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND FRANCISCO HERNANDEZ, IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY. ONE OF THE THINGS THE LAYOUT HERE IS THESE ARE PEOPLE SEEKING ASYLUM. THERE IS A PROCESS TO SEEK ASYLUM. THEY HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE UNTIL THEY CAN GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS. RIGHT, JASON? YES. THEY CAN CLAIM ASYLUM AND GO TO UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN THE COUNTRY OF OREGON. THERE IS THIS PRINCIPLE WHERE THEY JUST DO NOT GET THE CARAVAN COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AND STATE TO STATE AND FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY WANT TO GO. WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE THE OPPRESSION, YOU NEED TO STOP WHERE YOU ARE FREE OF THAT OPPRESSION. Martha: FRANCISCO, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT? THEY CAME MOSTLY FROM HONDURAS. ONCE THEY GOT INTO MEXICO, THEY WERE FREE OF THE OPPRESSION THEY WEAR UNDER ACCORDING TO THEM IN THEIR SITUATION, THE APPLICATION, IN HONDURAS AND GUATEMALA? ACTUALLY, NO. MEXICO DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL ASYLUM PROCESS LIKE WE DO. WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS THESE FOLKS ARE TRYING TO APPLY TO COME HERE ILLEGALLY. THE PROBLEM WITH APPLYING AT THE EMBASSY IN HONDURAS IS IF THEY ARE TURNED AWAY, WE ARE TURNING THEM AWAY TO THE VERY SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE PROSECUTING THEM, WHO ARE GOING TO KILL THEM, NARCO TRAFFICKER, CARTELS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT NEITHER COUNTRY CAN ADMIT THAT HONDURAS CANNOT GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF ITS CITIZENS. WE HAVE TO LET EVERYONE IN. WE HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE WHO LEGALLY AND LAWFULLY COME TO THIS COUNTRY AND WE ARE FAILING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO IT LEGALLY. THEY JUST WANT TO GO THROUGH THE DOOR. NO, BUT THERE IS NO PROCESS WHERE THESE FOLKS CAN APPLY TO COME HERE OTHER THAN KNOCK ON THE DOOR. LOOK, THEY CAN TRY TO PAY A SMUGGLER TO CROSS THEM WITH A TUNNEL OR A TALL LADDER, BUT THE PROBLEM IS THEY ARE TRYING TO APPLY TO COME HERE LEGALLY. Martha: YEAH, BUT FRANCISCO, THAT'S WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. THERE IS A PROCESS. THERE ARE 150 AND 60 OF THEM. THEY ARE ALREADY PROCESSING SOME 300 PEOPLE, AS YOU JUST HEARD IN THE REPORT. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, YOU HAVE TO WAIT YOUR TURN. YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE APPLICATION PROCESS. CORRECT. Martha: WHATEVER PERCENTAGE OF THEM MAY ACTUALLY BE GRANTED ASYLUM BASED ON THEIR SITUATION. WE KNOW THEY ARE BEING ADVISED IN TERMS OF HOW TO WORK THAT SYSTEM. BUT THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS. THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING. THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE PROOF OF THE PERSECUTION. ABOUT 75% OF ALL HONDURAN APPLICATIONS ARE DENIED ANYWAY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THEM. BUT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO APPLY TO COME HERE LEGALLY. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE ASYLUM LAWS, CHANGE THEM. I AGREE. Martha: JASON, MY QUESTION WHY ARE THEY DENIED? AGAIN, HE MAKES A POINT. NEED TO CHANGE THE LAW. THE LAW IS WORKING. THESE WANT TO BREAK THE LAW. THEY CAN GO TO THE UNITED STATES AND BUSY IN HONDURAS. YOU CANNOT APPLY IN THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY IN HONDURAS! THEY WILL NOT LET THEM APPLY! YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO GET IN THE DOOR. HERE, THEY ARE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR TO APPLY HERE LEGALLY. CAN Y'ALL NOT GET THE POINT? YOU WANT TO OBEY THE OBEY THE LAW, YOU DO NOT LIKE THE OLD LAW OF POLITICAL ASYLUM! Martha: SOUND LIKE THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT THEIR TURN AND
