EMPLOYERS IN
THE UNITED STATES ARE NOW
EXPLORING THE OPTION OF
MICRO-CHIPPING THEIR EMPLOYEES.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, TAKE
THREE SQUARE MARKET, A WISCONSIN
COMPANY. ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES
AT THAT COMPANY WENT TO A BIO
HACK CONVENTION IN SWEDEN WHERE
THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE
CHIPS IS TRYING TO APPEAL TO
EMPLOYERS. WHAT WOULD IT DO? IT
WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO HAVE
ACCESS TO THE OFFICE BUILDING.
IT WOULD ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO
THE COMPUTER, AND IT WOULD MAKE
LIFE EASIER, MORE CONVENIENT,
BUT THERE ARE SOME PRIVACY
CONCERNS AS WELL. THIS MICROCHIP
IS IMPLANTED IN YOUR FINGER.
CRAZY.
>> BEWARE OF MANAGERS WEARING
GIFTS. IN ALL FAIRNESS I THINK
THEY GENUINELY GOT EXCITED AND
THEY DO CARE ABOUT THE
TECHNOLOGY. FROM MY READING I
DON'T SEE A BAD INTENT.
>> MY SENSE AND READ OF THIS
COMPANY IS NOT THAT THERE IS ANY
MALICIOUS INTENT BUT THAT THEY
WANT TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE.
SO IT IS EXCITING. BUT THERE ARE
SOME REVOCATIONS TO THAT.
>> AND IT IS NOT JUST A Q PARTY
THEY HAD CHIPS AND SALSA. BUT
THIS STARTS AS YOU CAN TURN ON A
COMPUTER WITH YOUR HAND. YOU
THINK THEY CAN'T TRACK WHERE YOU
ARE MOVING IF THERE IS A CHIP
INSIDE YOU? WHY WOULD YOUR
EMPLOYER 
WANT TO 
DO THAT?
>> I HAVE NO PROBLEM TURNING ON
MY COMPUTER WITH MY FINGERS. I
HAVE NO PROBLEM USING A KEY OR
ANYTHING I NEED TO USE OTHER
THAN A MICROCHIP TO OPEN A DOOR
TO MY OFFICE. I FEEL LIKE WE GET
SO EXCITED ABOUT TECHNOLOGY THAT
WE DON'T THINK ENOUGH ABOUT HOW
INVASIVE IT COULD BE,
PRIVACY CONCERNS.
BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE
MICROCHIP.
WE ARE READY HAVE ENOUGH
TECHNOLOGY TRACKING WHAT WE
ARE DOING.
>> HAVING A CHIP INSIDE YOUR
BODY Ã± TERRIBLE IDEA. YOU SHOULD
HAVE TWO WORDS, HELL NO. I WILL
GIVE YOU MORE EXAMPLES OF WHAT
CAN GO WRONG BUT FIRST I WANT TO
KNOW HOW FUNNY WHAT ANNA SAID
WAS. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF YOU CAN
TURN ON YOUR COMPUTER WITH YOUR
OWN HAND? IT IS NOT THAT MUCH
HARDER TO PRESS THE BUTTON. THE
WASHINGTON POST NOTES TRACKABLE
DATA IS HACKABLE DATA. WHETHER
IT IS YOUR MANAGER OR SOMEONE
ELSE, WHAT 
IF YOUR-
>> THIS COULD ALSO INCLUDE
PAYMENT DATA TO USE THE CHIP FOR
THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO BUY. I
DON'T REALLY WANT A CHIP TO HAVE
THAT DATA.
I 
FEEL HAVING IT ON A MICROCHIP
IS JUST AN EXTRA LAYER OF A
POTENTIAL SECURITY RISK.
>> IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT MUCH
TIME TO TAKE OUT MY CREDIT CARD
OR DEBIT CARD AT THE GROCERY
STORE.
>>AND YOU CAN TURN OFF THE GPS
TRACKING.
>> THIS IS SCIENCE FICTION
BECOMING REALITY. EVEN IF YOU
THINK THEY MEAN WELL, DON'T DO
IT. IT IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.
