the decision to ban Russian athletes follows an investigation by an IOC bar Commission headed by a former head of the Swiss department of sport and former president of the country Samuel Schmidt to discuss the issue further and I joined live in the studio by Kate partridge Kate's well this is what has happened after 18 months of Investigation and the thing here that really gets me is that we're just months away from the Winter Olympics this is all coming you've got athletes who've been preparing for absolute years for this perhaps their first opportunity but now the ban is implemented what does this actually mean well it doesn't give them a great deal of time to to appeal against this because first of all let's look at it on a legal basis athletes who have been banned they've been 25 that have been banned already and it looks like on the basis of this decision they're obviously going to be looking at are the medal decisions that we we heard from Thomas Bach they're saying that not only we're going to be looking at the medals that were won in Sochi of course let's let's not forget there that Russia topped the medal table but also the fact that some of those medal ceremonies are going to be repeated again in Pyeongchang you know because of when we looked at whether or not these these cases then go through if these athletes are banned and their medals gone that's a lot of that's a lot of Appeals to go through and after that you're looking at at leats then as you've been rightly saying who've been preparing forever and concentrating on sport if then got to go through the distraction that saw said the legal case of going through appeals and also waiting to see whether or not they'll be able to take part we just saw their faces cater before we just came to you and the dismay the disappointment as they were watching live that announcement by the IOC you could just see their hopes being dashed these are people who have never filled a doping test in their entire careers that's correct and that's right but the whole point about what's happened with it's subject to the report says it's all based on on what they consider to be at the basis of probability okay this isn't a present this is a presumption of guilt rather than okay because the idea is that it's all about levels of probability they've gone through they've as you said there's been a 17 month investigation subsequent to what was the McLaren report the McLaren report effectively came out and claimed that there was state-sponsored doping by Russia then after that it went into the details of how it was done and also the athletes a thousand athletes they believe from Russia across 30 different sports this is not just the Winter Olympics this will have other ramifications as well they said were implicated in this then after that it was a case of going about proving it what happened was in the meantime you had the Rio game so the initial reaction was okay we're going to stop the Russian track-and-field athletes competing in Rio and then there were there were so-called clean athletes and other athletes who'd be not what they said part of the system been trained elsewhere in the world we're allowed to take part under a neutral flag then of course then you have the long-term investigation and up until a month ago it was looking better for Russia because they weren't able to effectively back up what they believed were the claims by grigory Rodchenko who'd run the lab in Moscow just they would have been happening then about a month ago you had the world anti-doping agency said what we're looking at the Russian system again and it looks like resada the Russian anti-doping agency is non-compliant that was a bit ominous for Russia also in the meantime as well you had a commission saying that the claim was that been this systemic this means of doping this hiding the positive doping results by the elaborate system and what the IOC Commission said was they were able to replicate that and the argument argument was is that they've gone through the system has said we found variations of scratches on bottles and also salt in various samples we've been able to replicate what the Russian did and based on all of that plus rodchenko's Diaries we're able to say that on a balance of probabilities that this is we can effectively say that that's happened but then of course you've got the question of doubt and transparency the IOC in their investigations are claiming that because we could replicate the system that the Russians did therefore it's a chance that it happened but you've got some athletes like Oh Leona Bjorn darling who's a biathlete saying well if it's a case of it's based on scratches of bottles then actually I'm a bit scared and we can here for go now I hope that we will be able to see some evidence for what they're being punished and that is not that error some marks on the bottles because then I will be terribly afraid of giving samples well has we heard then it's a case of athletes are in fear because we need I think more transparency on this if you look through all the reading for alexander lenkov which was the basis from from all these effectively what's come from this decision has come from that in it they the IOC gave the that there their reasons for this particular ruling all those levels of probability and it's this whole kind of presumption of guilt by going through the system that's created a lot of fear really we need to be able to look at those scratches on bottles I think it would help everybody if we were to say okay the IFC said we've replicated the system let's have a look at it then what have you done shows the photo show us a film show us how it was done then and therefore that would effectively sort of calm a lot of fears and also give more credibility to what is as I said the basis presumption of guilt here and that's the thing isn't it because you're talking about seeing some kind of evidence that's never been put forward on any kind of tampering with bottles we have to take that really as being proof although we can't see it so on that you've got thousands of athletes according to this from 2012 to 2015 and future athletes their careers are now being based on that that we don't know about and also subsequent to that and you look at svetlana sure over he was a former speed skater and is now in the duma she is really concerned about the fact that young athletes who are outside of this the so called system in 2015 are also effective affected by this sort of blanket ban and if they are then given the opportunity asked me enough it's to go forward they have very little time to sort of prove their case so this is the problem is there's not a lot of time you know something is located it seems to me just from hearing reactions to other athletes that even though they're given this opportunity to compete in the games under a neutral flag not very many of them want to take that opportunity because they're thinking it's the games aren't just for me they're for my family my friends this is my country this is who I represent I've heard some criticism saying well why not just go and compete under a neutral flag but that doesn't take into account you know how much pride they have in a nation from which they're competing on which they've trained their whole lives to do so absolutely I think the really the flag has caused more problems than anything else and more offence because it's a presumption you're looking at the presumed guilty idea of that it's an entire country that has been implicated but underneath that you you have the the IOC saying effectively clean athletes are then allowed to take part well we've got a blanket black band but also saying clean athletes take part so in a way no overlap here isn't that and you've got one side of athletes who are effectively people who are involved in sports saying very much they want people to take part and then of course you've got other people arguing saying this has become politicized and this is where it's caused a lot of problem and particular controversy okay let's take a listen four years ago there were skepticism that Russia's first Winter Olympics would go without a hitch do mongers predicted not enough flights not enough hotels and not enough snow your concerns about Sochi squaller in Sochi double toilets and missing door handles the water that came out of the town problem with the door but the host games went so well even critics had to admit they were hit everything's been amazing it's running like clockwork and and everything's just going really really well I've been really impressed with everything Russia's done so far really nice so far it's well organized and people are really friendly here and having a good time pretty sweet like who our accommodation our food almost four years later and Russians who triumphed in Sochi and are being stripped of their medals and given life Olympic bands why in 2016 the Muharram report explosively claimed Russia used an elaborate system of state-sponsored doping athletes officials and ministers were implicated like the plot of a cold war novel the attitude to Russia returned to skepticism then retribution as its track and field team and entire Paralympic team were banned from the Rio games which left the clean athletes wondering why we cannot have the Russians completing again until they have adopted the right policies that sure that they are a clean nation nevermind cleaned athletes they have to be a clean nation the IOC and IPC have now definitively backed up Maclaren supporting the claims of former lab boss Cory green Rajan cough who's under criminal investigation in Russia and saying that infamous sample swapping system has finally been replicated but questions remain the IOC standard of proof is not beyond any reasonable doubt but rather the balance of probability the presumption of guilt is enough it was Rajan cough who is the original and only source of so-called proof against Russian athletes this evidence has been grossly overvalued we can't say we are seeing the result of a proper legal process it's a question of faith to believe watching cough or not it looks more like a religious Inquisition where sample bottles had no visible scratches they were presumed tampered with as the Russians must have perfected their technique and left no marks the no argument basis for an on mass ban the clean condemned without any guilt no presumption of innocence for Team Russia what we see here is actually a violation of the Olympic Charter which is which stands against political national racial discrimination so it appears that in the name of protecting clean athletes they are actually taking away the rights of Russian clean athletes and in my opinion the Maclaren accusations are unfounded and they're very politically biased surely any athlete should be denied a medal and banned from competition if he or she cheats it undermines others lifetime's work as does a ban slapped on the innocent who has simply presumed guilty yes the key point there is is presumed guilty and let's also look back about some of the other cries that have come up about double standards here I mean there have been other athletes who've been effectively sure that's done for badges we know Justin Gatlin Tyson Gay as well the American athletes I mean they've received bans as rather than subsequently being able to compete which I thought was actually contrary to what the IOC had always believed in the fact that effectively we were always told as we were growing up it's a case if you have those bans it goes against the illusion just American came back and won a silver medal at the 2016 Rio games absolutely yes so that was that was something where was kind of different standard that was applied there so this has raised a lot of issues thanks very much Kate parted with the comprehensive update on that well some Western athletes had heartfelt messages for the Russian counterparts who as we've been speaking about are now set to miss out on the games that was in contrast to some of the gloating headlines I suppose it's safe to say in parts of the media's news of the ban Brooke well those number of international plates express sympathy on Twitter with some pointing out that the scandal has become a political symbol and that the move likely ignores punishment for those who have actually doped the doping scandal was triggered back in 2015 by the McLaren report as we have been speaking about he was the Canadian lawyer who put forward this document into part it claimed over a thousand athletes were involved in a state-sponsored doping conspiracy with positive samples being swapped for clean ones although it was meant to prove widespread unstated bug doping violations it's still being questioned over its supporting evidence the International Olympic Committee itself says it's unclear who was behind the doping it's not the investigations highlighted between 2012 and 2015 the ioc report also mentions it was unable to find evidence to suggest the russian government was responsible outside of the sports ministry nevertheless the independent and impartial evidence do not allow the IOC DC to establish with certitude either who initiated or who headed this scheme on many occasions reference was made on the involvement at the minister of sports level but no indication independent or impartial evidence appeared to corroborate any involvement or knowledge at a higher level of the state
