1
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:02,334
24/7.

2
00:00:02,334 --> 00:00:04,603
THIS PRESIDENT PROMISED YOU MORE

3
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:04,904
JOBS.

4
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:11,410
IN 501 DAY HES IS DELIVERIY.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,314
JOINING US THE FORMER U.S.

6
00:00:15,314 --> 00:00:17,249
ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF

7
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:18,117
COLUMBIA.

8
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:20,920
JOE, 18 MONTHS LATER, I HAVE A

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,988
PROBLEM, WE HAD A GOOD RESULT IN

10
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:25,457
THE CASE OF McCABE WHERE THERE

11
00:00:25,457 --> 00:00:28,327
WAS A CRIMINAL RER FALNOW.

12
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:29,695
-- REFERRAL.

13
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:31,230
NOW ROB ROSENSTEIN AND THE DOJ

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,599
HAVE HAD THIS REPORT FOR 2

15
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:33,966
WEEKS.

16
00:00:33,966 --> 00:00:35,901
THE SAME GUY THAT OBSTRUCTED

17
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:39,305
CONGRESS AND WON'T HAND OVER THE

18
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,474
DOCUMENTS THEY SUBPOENAED, WHY

19
00:00:42,474 --> 00:00:45,811
DO I NOT TRUST HIM THAT THEY

20
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:48,681
WANT REDACTIONS TO PROTECT

21
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:49,081
THEMSELVES?

22
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,517
>> THE REASON IS SIMPLE, SEAN.

23
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:54,053
ROB ROSENSTEIN IS A CAREERIST.

24
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,555
HE BELIEVES IN THE INSTITUTION

25
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:57,923
OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND

26
00:00:57,923 --> 00:01:02,361
THE FBI TO THE EXCLUSION OF ANY

27
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:03,996
ACCUSATIONS OF FAULT.

28
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:07,433
THE IG REPORT IS BEING SCRUBBED

29
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,636
BY ROSENSTEIN TO REMOVE AS MUCH

30
00:01:10,636 --> 00:01:11,470
EMBARRASSING INFORMATION ABOUT

31
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,839
THE BUREAU AS POSSIBLE.

32
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,474
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S GOING TO BE

33
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:17,876
DELAY THE RELEASE OF THE REPORT

34
00:01:17,876 --> 00:01:20,779
AND PERHAPS PUT IT OUT DURING

35
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:21,380
THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT.

36
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,449
THIS CONDUCT BY ROSENSTEIN AND

37
00:01:23,449 --> 00:01:25,284
THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

38
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:27,219
DELAY IS REPREHENSIBLE.

39
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:29,154
BUT IT'S A PATTERN.

40
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:31,423
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS THEY

41
00:01:31,423 --> 00:01:34,293
WANT TO HURT THE PRESIDENT.

42
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:35,094
THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL

43
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,628
WANTS TO HURT THE PRESIDENT AND

44
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:40,232
PREVENT THE RELEASE OF TRUTHFUL

45
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:46,405
INFORMATION TO DENY

46
00:01:46,405 --> 00:01:48,340
TRANSPARENCIES TO THE AMERICAN

47
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:48,974
PEOPLE.

48
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:50,576
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE

49
00:01:50,576 --> 00:01:51,777
CAMPAIGN AND WHAT HAPPENED

50
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,213
DURING THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL

51
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:55,714
SERVER INVESTIGATION IS A

52
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:56,648
NATIONAL DISGRACE.

53
00:01:56,648 --> 00:01:58,083
ROSENSTEIN SHOULD BE AT THE

54
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,551
FOREFRONT OF RELEASING THAT

55
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,052
INFORMATION.

56
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:03,722
INSTEAD HE IS TRYING TO HIDE

57
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:06,692
SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF IT.

58
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:10,829
>> Sean: IT WON'T BE MICHAEL

59
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,631
HOROWITZ THAT DECIDES THE

60
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,699
RELEASE DATE.

61
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:19,438
IF IT'S RELEASED NOW THROUGH

62
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,907
NEXT WEEK WITH THIS HISTORIC

63
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,175
SINGAPORE SUMMIT WITH KIM

64
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:24,143
JONG-UN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, DO

65
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,378
YOU AGREE THEY ARE BURYING IT

66
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:28,247
DURING ONE OF THE MOST HISTORIC

67
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:28,781
SUMMITS IN HISTORY?

68
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,350
>> WELL, THERE IS NO QUESTION

69
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,551
THAT'S THEIR INTENT.

70
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,986
OTHERWISE THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN

71
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:35,054
RELEASE AID LONG TIME AGO.

72
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:37,089
THE REASON IT'S DELAYED IS TO

73
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:38,891
ALLOW THE LEAKS WHEN YOU SAW

74
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,594
TODAY, THE PARTIAL LEAK OF THE

75
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:46,665
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMEY

76
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:47,466
INSUBORDINATION.

77
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:49,568
HE WAS MORE THAN THAT.

78
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:55,574
HE SUBVERTED THE DEPARTMENT OF

79
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:55,974
JUSTICE.

80
00:02:55,974 --> 00:02:59,278
LORETTA LYNCH WAS COMPROMISED.

81
00:02:59,278 --> 00:03:01,647
THERE SAT SALLY YATES WHO COULD

82
00:03:01,647 --> 00:03:03,015
HAVE DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED AND

83
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:05,517
DECIDED THIS CASE ON BEHALF OF

84
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:06,351
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

85
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:08,854
WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IS THEY

86
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:13,325
ARE DELAYING TO PREVENT TIMELY

87
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:13,725
DISCLOSURE.

88
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:14,993
>> Sean: YOU ARE CONVINCED THEY

89
00:03:14,993 --> 00:03:21,400
WILL TRY TO BURY THIS?

90
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,934
>> ABSOLUTELY.

91
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,936
>> Sean: WHO WOULD MAKE THAT

92
00:03:23,936 --> 00:03:24,303
DECISION?

93
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:25,838
>> IT'S ROB ROSENSTEIN.

94
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,239
THE REPORT EVEN THOUGH IT'S

95
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,209
GOING TO CONGRESS IS CONTROLLED

96
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:30,809
BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

97
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:31,844
AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.

98
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:34,179
THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE

99
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:37,249
CHANGES FOR NATIONAL SECURITY OR

100
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:39,718
OTHER REASONS.

101
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:42,888
>> Sean: 2 WEEKS WORTH OF

102
00:03:42,888 --> 00:03:43,288
REDACTIONS.

103
00:03:43,288 --> 00:03:44,189
>> THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

104
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:46,892
>> Sean: AND REMEMBER THE FBI

105
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,093
DIRECTOR ASSIGNED ADDITIONAL

106
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:50,095
PEOPLE TO RESPOND MORE QUICKLY.

107
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:56,201
LET'S GO TO WHAT HAS COME OUT TO

108
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,537
THE INSUBORDINATION ISSUE.

109
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:02,541
WE KNOW THE FACTS IN THIS CASE.

110
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:06,645
IT'S INDISPUTABLE AT THIS POINT.

111
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,781
HILLARY CLINTON VIOLATED THE

112
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,650
ESPIONAGE ACT AND PUT TOP SECRET

113
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,118
INFORMATION ON A PRIVATE SERVER.

114
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,887
THAT'S ILLEGAL AND LIED ABOUT

115
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:15,154
IT.

116
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,923
AND AS I SAID, NOW THAT ROBERT

117
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:20,125
MUELLER WANTS EVERYBODY'S PHONES

118
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:24,897
IN CASE THEY USE ONE OF THESE

119
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,599
APPLICATIONS, HE WANTS ALL OF

120
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:36,842
THIS INFORMATION I WONDER IF

121
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:38,210
EVERYBODY DOES WHAT HILLARY

122
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,379
CLINTON DID.

123
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:43,015
LET'S THE APP AND ACID WATCH THE

124
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:47,753
PHONE AND TAKE THE SIMCARDS OUT

125
00:04:47,753 --> 00:04:51,323
HOW WOULD THAT WORK OUT FOR

126
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:51,790
ROBERT MUELLER?

127
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,293
>> THEY WOULD OBSTRUCT JUSTICE.

128
00:04:54,293 --> 00:04:57,296
THAT WASN'T THE WAY HILLARY

129
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:59,164
CLINTON WAS TREATED.

130
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:04,836
JAMES COMEY CONDUCTED A

131
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,238
FRAUDULENT INVESTIGATION.

132
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:11,176
NO SUSPECTS.

133
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:15,180
-- SUBPOENAS.

134
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,215
MASSIVE IMMUNITY.

135
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,749
YOU HAVE A DOUBLE STANDARD.

136
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:19,418
IT'S VISIBLE FROM THE WAY

137
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:21,353
MUELLER IS CONDUCTING HIS

138
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:21,787
INVESTIGATION.

139
00:05:21,787 --> 00:05:25,991
THE ULTIMATE PRESSURE OPPOSED TO

140
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:26,858
THE NO PRESSURE IN THE HILLARY

141
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:27,526
CLINTON INVESTIGATION.

142
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:29,561
>> Sean: AND THE LARGER ROLE?

143
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:36,201
WE ONLY HAVE A SAMPLING OF TEXT

144
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,237
MESSAGES OF PETER STRZOK.

145
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:42,975
THE HATRED THEY HAD FOR DONALD

146
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,476
TRUMP.

147
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:48,080
WE BROKE A STORY THAT SAID IT

148
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,583
WAS RUN OUT OF THE OBAMA WHITE

149
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,752
HOUSE.

150
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:54,319
THEY WERE WRITING THE

151
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,824
EXONERATION IN MAY AND THIS WAS

152
00:05:58,824 --> 00:05:59,124
JULY.

153
00:05:59,124 --> 00:06:02,461
HE LIEED TO THE FBI AND WAS

154
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,262
INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF

155
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:04,763
TRUMP AND ROBERT MUELLER

156
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,799
APPOINTED THIS GUY.

157
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:11,703
WHEN ARE THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM

158
00:06:11,703 --> 00:06:12,037
COMING?

159
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,839
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY

160
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,906
DOUBT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S

161
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:18,377
REPORT WILL DEAL WITH ALL OF

162
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,913
THAT.

163
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:22,914
PETER STRZOK IS A SERIOUS

164
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:23,248
PERSON.

165
00:06:23,248 --> 00:06:26,051
HE WOULD BE SOMEONE BECAUSE OF

166
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:29,921
THE KNOWLEDGE HE HAS OF COMEY,

167
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:32,991
HE MAY BE IMMUNIZED.

168
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:35,994
THERE WILL BE CRIMINAL REFERRALS

169
00:06:35,994 --> 00:06:37,529
FROM THE INVESTIGATION INVOLVING

170
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:43,201
THE WAY THE FBI COVERED UP THE

171
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,369
CLINTON INVESTIGATION LED BY THE

172
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:45,604
SENIOR DIRTY COP JAMES COMEY

173
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:47,105
THROUGH THE CASE.

174
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:54,780
IT'S THE MOST EMBARRASSING

175
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,816
SITUATION IN THE FBI.

176
00:06:57,816 --> 00:07:00,218
>> Sean: THERE ARE FBI AGENTS

177
00:07:00,218 --> 00:00:00,000
THAT WANT TO TELL THE STORY OF
