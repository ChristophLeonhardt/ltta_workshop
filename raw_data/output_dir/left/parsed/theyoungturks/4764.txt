RECENTLY DONALD TRUMP TOOK TO
TWITTER TO SHARE HOW OUTRAGED HE
IS IN REGARD TO THE RUSSIA
PROBE, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HE
HASN'T KNOWLEDGED THAT HE IS
BEING PERSONALLY INVESTIGATED AS
A RESULT OF THIS CASE.
IN FACT
HE'S BEING INVESTIGATED FOR
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE, MOSTLY
BECAUSE OF HIS OWN DOING AND
BECAUSE OF THE FACT HE DECIDED
TO FIRE JAMES COMEY.
NOW --
NOW --
KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS A
LITTLE BIT OF A CONFLICT IN
TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT DONALD
TRUMP WAS ACTUALLY ENCOURAGED OR
ADVISED TO FIRE COMEY BY JEFF
SESSIONS AND ALSO ROD
ROSENSTEIN.
AND IF THAT'S THE
CASE, THEY COULD ALSO BE
INVESTIGATED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE.
IF THEY TOLD HIM TO
FIRE COMEY THEY ARE ALSO
IMPLICATED IN THIS CASE.
ROSENSTEIN RELEASED A STATEMENT
ABOUT THIS, HE SAID --
ALSO, THIS IS SPECULATION,
THIS IS MY TAKE, THIS IS NOT
FACT, OR HASN'T BEEN CONFIRMED,
BUT I JUST GET THE SENSE THAT
MUELLER IS LIKE, DUDE, I DON'T
WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE, FINE,
I'M RECUSED.
THAT ROSENSTEIN DOESN'T WANT
TO DO IT ANYMORE.
YES.
HERE'S THE INTERESTING
THING, TRUMP STARTS TWEETING
ABOUT IT, OF COURSE HE'S
OUTRAGED, HE SAYS --
SO IT IS UNCLEAR WHO IS
TALKING ABOUT.
IS HE TALKING
ABOUT SESSIONS?
ROSENSTEIN?
HE'S TALKING ABOUT ROSENSTEIN.
WE ARE ASSUMING HE'S TALKING
ABOUT ROSENSTEIN, TALKING POINTS
MEMO WRITES --
BUT IT'S ALL SUPER
QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE IF YOU CAN
REMEMBER, DURING AN INTERVIEW,
TRUMP SAID THIS --
LOOK, HE'S A SHOW BOAT, HE'S A
GRANDSTANDER, THE FBI HAS BEEN
IN TURMOIL, YOU KNOW THAT, I
KNOW THAT, EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
WHAT I DID IS I WAS GOING TO
FIRE COMEY, MY DECISION.
YOU MADE THE DECISION BEFORE
THEY CAME IN?
I WAS GOING TO FIRE COMEY.
THERE'S NO GOOD TIME TO DO IT,
BY THE WAY.
IN YOUR LETTER YOU SAID I
ACCEPTED THE RECOMMENDATION.
YOU MADE THE DECISION?
I WAS GOING TO FIRE HIM
REGARDLESS OF RECOMMENDATIONS.
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO
IT UNILATERALLY, AND THEN
FAST-FORWARD TO TODAY, I'M BEING
INVESTIGATED FOR FIRING THE FBI
DIRECTOR BY THE MAN WHO TOLD ME
TO FIRE THE FBI DIRECTOR.
YOU ARE A CLOWN.
ROSENSTEIN NEEDS TO LEAVE.
HE
GOT USED WHEN HE WROTE THAT MEMO
THAT HE SHOULD'VE REFUSED TO
WRITE, BUT WHEN HE AGREED TO
WRITE IT, IF HE DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WAS A REASON WHY THEY
WANTED YOU TO WRITE THE MEMO,
IT'S SO WHETHER TRUMP THEN MADE
A MISTAKE AND I THINK THE PLAN
BY BECAUSE HE CAN'T HELP HIMSELF
BY GOING ON WITH LESTER HOLT AND
ADMITTING, NO, IT WAS MY
DECISION AND I WAS I WAS GOING
TO DO IT, BUT STILL EVEN NOW
THEY CAN ALWAYS REFER BACK, HE
COULD SAY I WAS GOING TO DO IT
BUT I GOT BOTH JEFF SESSIONS,
WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE ALREADY
RECUSED HIMSELF, AND ROD
ROSENSTEIN WROTE THIS MEMO.
HE
GOT PLAYED, HE ALLEGEDLY HAS
THIS REPUTATION FOR BEING
ROSENSTEIN DOES BEING A SERIOUS
BIPARTISAN YOU KNOW HE'S A
PROFESSIONAL, THAT WAS THE IMAGE
WE WERE -- BUT A PROFESSIONAL
DOESN'T ALLOW HIMSELF TO GET
USED LIKE THAT, AND QUITTING NOW
AGAIN WOULD SERVE HIM WELL.
BUT
I SEE NO INDICATION THAT HE WILL
DO THAT.
EVERYONE IN AMERICA
SHOULD GET FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH
THE NAME RACHEL BRAND, SHE'S THE
THIRD IN COMMAND AT THE JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT, AND WHEN ROSENSTEIN
RECUSES HIMSELF, AND SINCE TRUMP
HAD A CONVERSATION WITH HIM
WHERE HE ASKED HIM TO WRITE THIS
MEMO OBVIOUSLY IT WOULD APPEAR
THAT THAT WOULD BE PART OF
MUELLER'S INVESTIGATION, WHAT
WAS THAT CONVERSATION LIKE?
WHAT
WAS YOUR CONVERSATION WITH THE
PRESIDENT?
THAT MAKES YOU
INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION,
NOT THE TARGET OF IT, SO MY
HUNCH IS ROSENSTEIN WILL HAVE TO
RECUSE HIMSELF AND RACHEL BRAND
WILL BE THE PERSON WHO
ULTIMATELY TRUMP PRESSURES TO
FIRE ROBERT MUELLER.
AND
THEN ULTIMATELY SHE WILL HAVE TO
RECUSE HERSELF IN SOME WAY.
SHE JUST GOT HERE, MAYBE SHE
WON'T.
IF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN RUSSIA
HAD TO RECUSE THEMSELVES WE
WOULD HAVE NO GOVERNMENT.
BUT
THE MOST INSANE THING ABOUT THIS
IS IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE WITH
THE PRESIDENT, WE HAVE TO TRY TO
INTERPRET HIS TWEETS.
IT'S ABSURD.
THAT IS LIKE TALKING TO A
14-YEAR-OLD GIRL, LIKE, WHAT DID
THAT WE REALLY MEAN?
DON'T INSULT 14-YEAR-OLD
GIRLS.
WELL, THEIR HANDS ARE ABOUT
THE SAME SIZE.
