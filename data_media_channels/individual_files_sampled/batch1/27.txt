in dongle ax many are surviving on coconuts and whatever else they can scavenge from the rubble the death toll now stands at a 1420 for thousands more people are in hospital where Wayne Hays our correspondent and he's managed to get to dong gala one of the few international news teams Wayne to get to this part of Sulawesi Island what have you discovered there well Martine we have discovered that there are entire communities that have disappeared here I mean the scene behind me may look like a beach but really up until Friday last week this was a tightly packed fishing village and now it is completely gone his livelihoods swept away when those huge waves came through here swept down the bay towards Palu City taking absolutely everything with them as you mentioned this area very close to the epicenter of the earthquake really the largest significant population to the quake so clearly it was felt very strong by the people here and they say that they had just two minutes before the first wave came two minutes after the earthquake struck there was a lot of concern since Friday about the people in this area the population is just under 300,000 because communication was largely cut off access was pretty much cut off as well so the fate of the population here was largely unknown officially the death toll is around 150 just over 150 here many more people are still missing they think or at least some people are still missing they presume they have been swept out to sea because there is no search-and-rescue operation going on here there is no sign of any rebuilding no heavy machinery coming in here to clear away the rubble so that process can pet started simply a case of people either sitting around contemplating what has happened with them people picking through what is left of their homes their communities trying to find anything that may be left of value matting and tell us about your journey from pal√º they the main city on the island your journey to don't gala because presumably that would be the journey that any aid supplies and rescuers and help would have to take as well yes well that road is now largely open it's not a direct line as it used to be a fairly smooth road along this coastline between Paulo and dong gali you certainly have to deviate off I yea hillside inland around some of the damaged roads there is still a lot of debris over over some sections of the road so it does take some time but certainly that road between pilou City and dong Gala is open now aid can get through heavy machinery prop could probably get through as well but again there is no sign of that some aid is coming through but the people here are saying it is not enough they need more water they need food they need some medical supplies and other things like that they do say though that even though communication was cut off and the fate of the people here was as I say was largely unknown in the aftermath of the quake and tsunami that some aid was immediately coming through from another direction from the West from basically this end of the peninsula coming through from other areas of Sulawesi said they were getting some assistance very early on but it's just that not much was known about that because the communication was was so difficult on Wednesday we saw the Indonesian president come here Joko Widodo was his first visit to dong gala because there had been a lot of publicity about the fact that there was no communication there was no access to this area so he wanted to come and see exactly what the scene was what the people needed and he's promised that the government will help with the communities here they will give them cash to rebuild the people's and say here they very much very much will need that money but they will believe it when they see it okay Wayne thank you very much Wayne hey live there in dongle or a small fishing community
