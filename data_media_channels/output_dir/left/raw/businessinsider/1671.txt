00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sides have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:10,820
chill do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that American democracy</font>

00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,480
ends if Trump is president now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,500
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are plenty of checks and</font>

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,779
balances in place I think he would do

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,220
some damage to the country but we would

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,580
recover the office of the presidency and

8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,260
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> and demerit American democratic</font>

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">institutions are a lot stronger than one</font>

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,090
person we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to</font>

11
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,470
reinvigorate our political institutions

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,750
and he's sort of demonstrating to us the

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,090
urgency of that task we want American

14
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,809
democracy to be flourishing 10 15 and 20

15
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:45,539
and 50 years from<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and the only way</font>

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,570
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work is if we calm down</font>

17
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,510
a little I'm always surprised when

18
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,489
people don't take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the long view so you</font>

19
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,170
have a country that's been around for

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,079
going on 250 years that has been an

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,120
extraordinarily successful democracy and

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,250
it's been successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of the</font>

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,170
strength of its institutions the kind of

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,600
rhetoric that people are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using now</font>

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,670
strikes me is incredibly damaging you

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,799
you know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> may hate Hillary Clinton</font>

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may have good reason for hating</font>

28
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,659
Hillary Clinton but Hillary Clinton is

29
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:17,310
one person who even if she's elected

30
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,189
will be gone one day and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font>

31
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">use threatening dangerous negative angry</font>

32
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,140
language about people who are running

33
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,509
for trying to be public servants and

34
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:31,770
have a history by the way in public

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,439
service you're creating some potential

36
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:36,630
for long-term damage that is pretty

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:00:00,000
serious
