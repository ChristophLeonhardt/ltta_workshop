this weekend is Super Sunday as the Patriots shall go about plucking the Eagles yet again but even before the coin toss the NFL has fumbled again when it comes to the thorny issue of disrespecting the star-spangled banner even with the absence of : Kaepernick on any roster we all remember how bittersweet this past NFL season was at least in the early stages given the number of players who dissed the national anthem by taking a knee the NFL reacted to the anthem protests in a spineless manner their attitude was essentially hey boys will be boys there's no rule that actually prohibits players from kneeling so what you're gonna do but all that rhetoric is ringing hollow now in light of the NFL snubbing the largest US veteran's service organization you see AM vet was invited by the NFL to place a free ad during Super Bowl 52 hey that's jolly good of the league isn't it and AM vets idea for an ad was brilliantly simple yet profound namely a two-word message reading hashtag please stand but the NFL rejected that ad no really they did check out what NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy had to say about this act of censorship namely the game game program is quote designed for fans to commemorate and celebrate the game players teams and the Superbowl it's never been a place for advertising that could be considered by some as a political statement end quote did you catch that politely asking people to stand for the star-spangled banner is a political statement where does this request make for a political statement in North Korea Iran Venezuela but apparently the league feels that this ad might be offensive to a handful of 300-pound social justice line backers actually what am I saying folks it's now crystal clear that the social justice Warriors have taken over the Commissioner's Office because of asking Americans in America to stand for the American national anthem is deemed to be a political statement the NFL is now irredeemable what's more it is now apparent that the people residing in the NFL front office never really were all that concerned about players taking a knee during the anthem all that hand wringing and frowning and posturing it was all so much Kabuki theater no NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell probably secretly approved of those half-baked protests on company time how else can you possibly explain such a mind-numbing act of censorship especially when the NFL should be desperate for good PR especially when it comes to patriotism indeed the NFL at a first and goal opportunity to repair frayed nerves and lure back disenchanted fans but they blew it big Lee despite the fact that both NFL TV ratings and stadium attendance fell significantly this season forget about the players it's as if the people running the league are the ones suffering from post concussion syndrome because in the new world order of the National Football League according to Goodell and his minions the NFL's multi-million dollar mercenaries are free to kneel when they should be standing and as for the men and women serving in the military well hey guys well after you do that little fly over the stadium can you kindly resume your rightful role and go back to putting your lives on the line defending America abroad so that the NFL can keep its multibillion-dollar pigskin cartel rolling but in the meantime don't you even think about asking anyone to stand at attention for a song that represents the country the constitution and everything that's great about the United States of America for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
