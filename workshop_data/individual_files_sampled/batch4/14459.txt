Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dropped a bombshell unintended on Iran yesterday I'm gonna tell you all about it Benjamin Netanyahu's press conference yesterday was earth-shattering but not surprising we knew that Iran cheated with regards to their nuclear weapons program we know that Iran has been lying to the world what was earth-shattering it was groundbreaking about Bibi Netanyahu's press conference was the treasure trove of intelligence a gain gleaned by the Mossad and I presume allies in the intelligence community I'm guessing our CIA was involved our NSA was involved I'm guessing the Jordanians were probably involved maybe even the Saudis were involved all people that don't want to see Iran have nuclear weapons so if you didn't watch the press conference what did we learn well this has to go down in history as one of the most successful intelligence operations it was stellar work I mean I mean all of the job done by Israeli intelligence in all they were able to grab roughly a hundred and five thousand files from the Iranians a secure bunker facility it looked like a little shack from the outside but inside was full of safes and they were able to get somewhere in the neighborhood of 55,000 pages actual hard pages in binders about Israel Iran nuclear weapons program in addition they got another 183 computer disks that contained another 50,000 or so files those files contained everything from plans proof blueprints photos videos documents schematics irrefutable conclusive proof and law enforcement we call it a smoking gun conclusive proof that Iran has been lying to the world and the OEE of these International Atomic Energy Commission IAEA now this puts the future of the Iran deal commonly known as the jcpoa in jeopardy the Iran deal at the aim of final stages gave as Netanyahu said Iran the chance to come fully clean for Iran to say we have no nuclear weapons whatsoever if they were honest or say hey look you got us we've been developing nuclear weapons in secret and this goes back in the late 90s the name of the operation was project Ahmad under which Iran secretly began developing nuclear weapons and run the looks of what was seized by Israeli intelligence they were getting there they were pretty far along now how do you know how do you know that this was not just about nuclear technology development for energy or medicine well you don't bury centrifuges underground as Netanyahu said who enriched medical nuclear material also in Farsi but in the in the some of the phrases couldn't be translated to Farsi where things like ten kiloton TNT and that referred to when translated from Farsi that Iran was seeking to develop five warheads each with a ten kiloton TNT yield in other words the warheads would be as powerful as ten kiloton of TNT when they detonated that's something like four to five times more powerful than the bombs we dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War two five warheads now think about which country Iran probably would have used one of those five warheads on or maybe all of those five warheads and you can understand why Israeli intelligence and of course that country is Israel you could understand why Israeli intelligence under this mission let's talk about the mission for a moment Wow Wow they had to I have had someone embedded in Iran's nuclear weapons program which tells me that someone inside Iran started to get very very nervous about what rouhani the president is up to and Khomeini the supreme leader are up to and my guess is analyzing these things studying these things understanding how they work on the inside my guess is somebody relatively senior or possibly very senior in the Iranian government said hey look we nuke Israel the weight of the world is coming down on us and Iran will cease to exist and my family's gonna die and my kids are gonna die all for these lunatics Ronnie and Khomeini know I've got to put an end to this and someone in the Iranian government helped the Israelis and brought the Israeli operatives in it's the only way the only way the Israelis were able to get this level of intelligence now the big question is what does Iran do next Iran was gained I mean they were literally shamed and embarrassed on the world stage this is devastating for Iran it's devastating for the Iran deal but the Obama administration was also shamed the Obama administration knew that Iran was bubble wrapping their nuclear program under the guise of research they knew this because if they didn't know this and then the Israeli intelligence services just proved that the Obama administration was the most incompetent inept naive bunch of morons who ever run the world's greatest superpower of the United States of America and I mean everybody Barack Obama Joe Biden Susan Rice Samantha power Ben Rhodes uh Hillary Clinton John Kerry Ashton Carter everybody involved Tim Geithner everyone involved with this would be ashamed of themselves now Ben Rhodes a former lapdog of the Obama administration member of their National Security Council I think he was deputy national security adviser if memory serves me correctly I often get into it with Ben Rhodes on social media in Rhodes who has been critical of President Trump in his administration daily I mean tweet upon tweet upon tweet about how wonderful Obama's foreign policy was and how terrible Trump's is how we were gonna be in World War three in North Korea now they're shaking hands Ben Rhodes has gone radio silent I haven't checked his Twitter feed today let's take a look and see if Ben Rhodes is still silent let's see when his last tweet was when this broke yeah Ben Rhodes last tweet was April 27 I'm sure he knew this information was coming out Ben Rhodes who was typically tweeting several times a day condemning the Trump administration ah deleted a bunch of tweets and his last tweet was four days ago he has not tweeted since he's probably hiding under a rock somewhere in shame if you want to find Ben Rhodes he's on the wrong side of history just look there I'm sure you'll find him and I think also with him over there on the wrong side of history is Barack Obama Hillary Clinton Joe Biden Susan Rice Samantha power name um just just name them name the list goes on and on John Brennan forgot to mention John Brennan Loretta Lynch Eric Holder all over there on the wrong side of history if you want to chat with the Obama gang just jump over the right side of history we got to build a wall now we're gonna build a wall between good history and bad history now this all broke shortly after French President Emmanuel macron visited the United States and interestingly if you noticed and that Rose Garden press conference did a 180 on the Iran deal he was all of a sudden all of a sudden opened to renegotiating it something tells me Trump shared all or part of this intelligence with him did he share the same with Angela Merkel and what role did Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have in all this because the day before this was released by Netanyahu which was yesterday so two days ago Pompeyo had met with Netanyahu what role did Mike Pompeo during his time at CIA playing all this well I'm gonna tell you all about that we're gonna go much deeper on my longer show off-the-cuff Declassified today right here on the rebel this is really really important content and I want to be able to bring you this every day I'm gonna stay on top of the story we're gonna analyze this as more information becomes available what Iran is up to it's put the entire world at red
