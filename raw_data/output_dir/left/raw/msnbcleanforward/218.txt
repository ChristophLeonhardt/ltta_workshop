167
00:04:59,436 --> 00:05:01,504
320 MILLION AMERICANS SHOULD CARE BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE MEN

168

CARE BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE MEN AND WOMEN PUT ON A UNIFORM TO

FIGHT FOR OUR FREEDOM AND UNDERSTAND WHY WE CARE.

171
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:12,782
UNDERSTAND WHY WE CARE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TAXPAYERS

172
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:15,384
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TAXPAYERS FUNDING BILLS AROUND THE WORLD

173

FUNDING BILLS AROUND THE WORLD AND WE KNOW IN A FLAT WORLD

STUFF THAT GOES WRONG IN THE MIDDLE EAST COMES HOME TO ROOST

MIDDLE EAST COMES HOME TO ROOST HERE.

00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:23,426
HERE. AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY NEEDS TO

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,895
AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY NEEDS TO BE BASED ON THE IDEA OF AN

AMERICAN CREED THAT BELIEVES IN UNIVERSAL HUMAN DIGNITY.

UNIVERSAL HUMAN DIGNITY. IT MEANS ALLIANCES MATTER TO TRY

TRIBALISM ARCING IN AMERICA AND I DON’T THINK THAT PROBLEM FLOWS

195
00:05:57,328 --> 00:05:58,728
I DON’T THINK THAT PROBLEM FLOWS FROM POLITICS.

00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:01,364
FROM POLITICS. WHY I WROTE "THEM" I WANT TO

PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. HAVING A FRIENDSHIP IN AMERICA

HAVING A FRIENDSHIP IN AMERICA IN THE LAST 27 YEARS.

00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:21,151
WE’VE GONE FROM 3.2 FRIENDS TO 1.8 FRIENDS.

205

POLITICS IS ABOUT BUILDING GOOD ROADS BUT NOT DEFINING

ROADS BUT NOT DEFINING COMMUNITY.

216
00:06:45,376 --> 00:06:47,611
COMMUNITY. MOST OF OUR POLITICS ARE

00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:03,508
HOUR A DAY, A DAY A WEEK, A WEEK A YEAR, GET AWAY FROM TECHNOLOGY

00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:05,343
A YEAR, GET AWAY FROM TECHNOLOGY AND HAVE FAMILY DINNER AGAIN.

327
00:10:05,378 --> 00:10:08,380
AND HAVE FAMILY DINNER AGAIN. THERE’S BEEN A HAVING OF HOSTING

328
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:12,584
THERE’S BEEN A HAVING OF HOSTING IN THE LAST 25 YEARS.

329
00:10:12,585 --> 00:10:16,722
IN THE LAST 25 YEARS. 25 YEARS AGO THE AVERAGE FAMILY

330
00:10:16,756 --> 00:10:19,959
25 YEARS AGO THE AVERAGE FAMILY INVITED PEOPLE OVER FOR DINNER

331
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,693
INVITED PEOPLE OVER FOR DINNER 14 TIMES A YEAR.

332
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:22,794
14 TIMES A YEAR. NOW IT’S EIGHT.

333
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,329
NOW IT’S EIGHT. AT THE END OF THE DAY POLITICS

334
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,697
AT THE END OF THE DAY POLITICS ARE IMPORTANT BUT POLITICS CAN’T

335
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:27,433
ARE IMPORTANT BUT POLITICS CAN’T SOLVE THE VACUUM WE’RE DEALING

336
00:10:27,466 --> 00:10:29,602
SOLVE THE VACUUM WE’RE DEALING WITH IN THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION

337
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:31,837
WITH IN THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION AND THE REASON I WROTE "THEM" WE

338
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:33,639
AND THE REASON I WROTE "THEM" WE NEED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME OF

339
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,574
NEED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOME OF THESE NOT JUST NEUTRAL CORNERS

340
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,644
THESE NOT JUST NEUTRAL CORNERS BUT NOT HYPER INSTANT

341
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:39,578
BUT NOT HYPER INSTANT POLITICIZED CORNERS.

342
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:44,316
POLITICIZED CORNERS. >> I KNOW YOU FEEL THE NEED,

343
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,218
>> I KNOW YOU FEEL THE NEED, SENATOR, TO TALK ABOUT THE

344
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:47,453
SENATOR, TO TALK ABOUT THE SMARTPHONE, A LOT OF AGGRAVATE

345
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:49,455
SMARTPHONE, A LOT OF AGGRAVATE THINGS ABOUT THE SMARTPHONE.

346
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:52,658
THINGS ABOUT THE SMARTPHONE. WITH FOUR KIDS THE OLDER I GET

347
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,260
WITH FOUR KIDS THE OLDER I GET THE LESS GREAT THINGS I SEE

348
00:10:54,261 --> 00:10:55,428
THE LESS GREAT THINGS I SEE ABOUT THE SMARTPHONE.

349
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:57,062
ABOUT THE SMARTPHONE. I BELIEVE IF YOU TALK TO

350
00:10:57,097 --> 00:10:58,597
I BELIEVE IF YOU TALK TO EDUCATORS AND YOU HEAR THE SAME

351
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:00,466
EDUCATORS AND YOU HEAR THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

352
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,268
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ANXIETY IS UP AMONG TEENAGERS

353
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:03,669
ANXIETY IS UP AMONG TEENAGERS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS.

354
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,770
AND COLLEGE STUDENTS. DEPRESSION IS UP.

355
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,338
DEPRESSION IS UP. IT ALL GOES BACK TO THIS.

356
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,940
IT ALL GOES BACK TO THIS. DO YOU THINK IT MAY BE POSSIBLE

357
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:09,475
DO YOU THINK IT MAY BE POSSIBLE THAT 20 YEARS FROM NOW WE’RE

358
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,745
THAT 20 YEARS FROM NOW WE’RE GOING TO LOOK AT UNREGULATED USE

359
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,480
GOING TO LOOK AT UNREGULATED USE OF SMARTPHONES BY DEVELOPING

360
00:11:14,481 --> 00:11:16,182
OF SMARTPHONES BY DEVELOPING MINDS THE SAME WAY WE’RE LOOKING

361
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:18,451
MINDS THE SAME WAY WE’RE LOOKING AT CIGARETTES AND HOW THEY WERE

362
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:19,952
AT CIGARETTES AND HOW THEY WERE VIEWED IN THE 1950s.

363
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:21,287
VIEWED IN THE 1950s. >> IT’S A GREAT QUESTION.

364
00:11:21,288 --> 00:11:23,089
>> IT’S A GREAT QUESTION. I’M NOT READY TO JUMP TO THE

365
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:24,524
I’M NOT READY TO JUMP TO THE POLITICAL ANSWERS BUT THERE’S A

366
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,158
POLITICAL ANSWERS BUT THERE’S A WHOLE CHAPTER ON WHAT YOU’RE

00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:34,767
I DO THINK PARENTS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ATTENTION BY

00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:36,269
UNDERSTAND THAT THE ATTENTION BY ENGINEERS 30 YEARS AGO WERE

371
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,305
ENGINEERS 30 YEARS AGO WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP

00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,114
TO KEEP OUR 15-YEAR-OLDS ADDICTED TO OUR SMARTPHONE.

376
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,116
ADDICTED TO OUR SMARTPHONE. THERE’S A TON OF DATA THAT SHOWS

00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:52,118
THERE’S A TON OF DATA THAT SHOWS YOUR FRONTAL LOBE ISN’T DONE

YOUR FRONTAL LOBE ISN’T DONE WHEN YOU’RE 15 AND 18.

WE’RE LONELIER AND MORE DISCONNECTED.

389
00:12:23,818 --> 00:12:25,552
DISCONNECTED. THE LAST TIME WE HAD ANYTHING

390
00:12:25,586 --> 00:12:29,389
THE LAST TIME WE HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS WAS DURING THE

391
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:30,256
LIKE THIS WAS DURING THE INDUSTRIALIZATION.

392
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,457
INDUSTRIALIZATION. PROHIBITION WAS THE RESPONSE TO

393
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,627
PROHIBITION WAS THE RESPONSE TO ALL THE WHOLISM BECAUSE OF THE

394
00:12:33,661 --> 00:12:35,161
ALL THE WHOLISM BECAUSE OF THE LONELINESS OF THE CITIES.

395
00:12:35,163 --> 00:12:36,663
LONELINESS OF THE CITIES. WE REFORMED SOCIAL CAPITAL IN

LOOKING AT INSTAGRAM FEEDS AND THINKING THAT’S THIS IDEALIZED

THINKING THAT’S THIS IDEALIZED WORLD THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO

WORLD THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO CREATE WILL NEVER BE MATCHED.

421
00:13:20,408 --> 00:13:21,808

00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,136
I WENT TO THE SENATE FLOOR AND SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT

440
00:13:49,171 --> 00:13:50,571
SAID THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THAT.

441
00:13:50,605 --> 00:13:52,639
SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE THAT. WE CAN’T NAVIGATE ISSUES LIKE

442
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:54,642
WE CAN’T NAVIGATE ISSUES LIKE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IN A RALLY

443
00:13:54,676 --> 00:13:55,476
THE ME TOO MOVEMENT IN A RALLY ENVIRONMENT.

444
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,910
ENVIRONMENT. FRANKLY THE SENATE BEARS A LOT

KAVANAUGH HEARING AND JUDICIAL COMMITTEE WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT.

450
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,020
COMMITTEE WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT. IT DIDN’T SERVE OUR KIDS WELL,

IT DIDN’T SERVE OUR KIDS WELL, THE KAVANAUGH FAMILY WELL, THE

456
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:27,642
GETTING DEATH THREATS. THAT CIRCUS ENVIRONMENT IS ABOUT

00:14:27,676 --> 00:14:28,976
THAT CIRCUS ENVIRONMENT IS ABOUT INSTITUTIONS THAT SHOULD BE

458
00:14:28,977 --> 00:14:30,478
INSTITUTIONS THAT SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS AND BUILDING PUBLIC

459
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:32,347
CAUTIOUS AND BUILDING PUBLIC TRUST, BEING SWALLOWED WHOLE BY

TO THE PRESIDENCY NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP BUT THE PRESIDENCY

468
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,067
ITSELF IF YOU LOOK AT HIS WRIENGS, I’M WONDER IF YOU’RE

469
00:14:53,069 --> 00:14:58,906
WRIENGS, I’M WONDER IF YOU’RE CONCERN THAT HE’S MORE OF A

470
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:01,509
CONCERN THAT HE’S MORE OF A HAMILTONIAN THAN A MADISONIAN HE

471
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,112
HAMILTONIAN THAN A MADISONIAN HE MAY DEFER TOO MUCH TO AN

472
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,314
MAY DEFER TOO MUCH TO AN IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY.

473

IMPERIAL PRESIDENCY. >> JOE YOU SAID BRIEF QUESTION

>> HOW ABOUT A BRIEF ANSWER? >> I’M GREAT AT THOSE.

478
00:15:16,826 --> 00:15:19,961
>> I’M GREAT AT THOSE. I DO THINK SOME OF THE NEWS HAS

479
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:21,229
I DO THINK SOME OF THE NEWS HAS MISCONSTRUED WHAT JUSTICE

480
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,030
MISCONSTRUED WHAT JUSTICE KAVANAUGH WAS SAYING.

481
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:24,099
KAVANAUGH WAS SAYING. I THINK HE WAS SAYING IN

I THINK HE WAS SAYING IN RETROSPECT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

483

RETROSPECT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN BOTH PARTIES REGARDED THE

484
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:29,738
IN BOTH PARTIES REGARDED THE STARR INVESTIGATION AS TOO

485
00:15:29,772 --> 00:15:30,105
STARR INVESTIGATION AS TOO BOUNDLESS.

486
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:31,840
BOUNDLESS. PEOPLE WERE HEARING IT AS

487
00:15:31,841 --> 00:15:33,041
PEOPLE WERE HEARING IT AS CRITICISM OF THE MUELLER

488
00:15:33,076 --> 00:15:34,042
CRITICISM OF THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION AND THERE’S A

489
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,878
INVESTIGATION AND THERE’S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SPECIAL

490
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:39,347
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR AND SPECIAL

491
00:15:39,381 --> 00:15:40,048
INVESTIGATOR AND SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.

492
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,317
PROSECUTOR. THE HAMILTONIAN DEBATES HOW

493
00:15:42,351 --> 00:15:45,453
THE HAMILTONIAN DEBATES HOW THREE BRANCHES STOP AT THREE, I

494
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,188
THREE BRANCHES STOP AT THREE, I THINK THAT STUFF IS PRETTY

495
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:47,556
THINK THAT STUFF IS PRETTY IMPORTANT.

496
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,691
IMPORTANT. SO I DON’T THINK THERE’S MUCH TO

497
00:15:49,725 --> 00:15:51,459
SO I DON’T THINK THERE’S MUCH TO BE THAT FRIGHTENED ABOUT IN WHAT

498
00:15:51,461 --> 00:15:53,061
BE THAT FRIGHTENED ABOUT IN WHAT KAVANAUGH HAS WRITTEN ABOUT HIS

499
00:15:53,096 --> 00:15:54,863
KAVANAUGH HAS WRITTEN ABOUT HIS WORRIES OVER THE LAST 10 OR 15

500
00:15:54,864 --> 00:15:57,165
WORRIES OVER THE LAST 10 OR 15 YEARS ABOUT THE LATE 1990s AND

501
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,299
YEARS ABOUT THE LATE 1990s AND THE DOWNLESS STARR

502
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:58,767
THE DOWNLESS STARR INVESTIGATION.

503
00:15:58,801 --> 00:16:00,435
INVESTIGATION. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT DEBATES WE

504
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,670
THOSE ARE IMPORTANT DEBATES WE SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE.

505
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:02,337
SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE. >> YEAH.

506
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:04,473
>> YEAH. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP AND TRY TO

507
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:05,974
I WANT TO FOLLOW UP AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR VOTE MORE.

508
00:16:05,976 --> 00:16:08,443
UNDERSTAND YOUR VOTE MORE. >> SURE.

509
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:10,979
>> SURE. >> BECAUSE HE EVEN SAID IN 2015

510
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:13,682
>> BECAUSE HE EVEN SAID IN 2015 IN A SPEECH ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS

511
00:16:13,716 --> 00:16:16,051
IN A SPEECH ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A JUDGE, TO BE ON THE

512
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:16,384
TO BE A JUDGE, TO BE ON THE BENCH.

513
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:19,087
BENCH. AND HE DESCRIBED THE ATTRIBUTES

514
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:20,855
AND HE DESCRIBED THE ATTRIBUTES OF THAT PERSON.

515
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,891
OF THAT PERSON. AND THEN HE WENT THROUGH EVERY

516
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:25,227
AND THEN HE WENT THROUGH EVERY STOP SIGN OF HIS OWN DESCRIPTION

517
00:16:25,261 --> 00:16:27,296
STOP SIGN OF HIS OWN DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A JUDGE.

518
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,164
OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A JUDGE. HE WAS RUDE.

519
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:29,665
HE WAS RUDE. HE WAS DEFIANT.

520
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:33,268
HE WAS DEFIANT. HE SHOWED RAGE.

521
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,102
HE SHOWED RAGE. HE WAS POLITICAL.

522
00:16:34,104 --> 00:16:35,971
HE WAS POLITICAL. AND HE WAS VERY UNDISCIPLINED

523
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:37,673
AND HE WAS VERY UNDISCIPLINED DURING HIS OPENING STATEMENTS BY

524
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:39,108
DURING HIS OPENING STATEMENTS BY HIS OWN DEFINITION OF WHAT IT

525
00:16:39,109 --> 00:16:41,210
HIS OWN DEFINITION OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FIT TO BE A JUDGE.

526
00:16:41,211 --> 00:16:44,680
MEANS TO BE FIT TO BE A JUDGE. SO WHILE I’M NOT SAYING THOSE

527
00:16:44,681 --> 00:16:46,815
SO WHILE I’M NOT SAYING THOSE BEHAVIORS MADE HIM GUILTY, BUT I

528
00:16:46,816 --> 00:16:49,117
BEHAVIORS MADE HIM GUILTY, BUT I AM ASKING YOU WHY THEY DIDN’T

529
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:50,919
AM ASKING YOU WHY THEY DIDN’T MAKE HIM UNFIT?

530
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:53,221
MAKE HIM UNFIT? >> MIKA, IT’S AN IMPORTANT

531
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:53,722
>> MIKA, IT’S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION.

532
00:16:53,757 --> 00:16:56,792
QUESTION. I THINK WE’RE 32 YEARS INTO THE

533
00:16:56,826 --> 00:16:57,626
I THINK WE’RE 32 YEARS INTO THE DECLINE OF THE SENATE

534
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:59,228
DECLINE OF THE SENATE CONFIRMATION PROCESS, GOING BACK

535
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,363
CONFIRMATION PROCESS, GOING BACK TO BORK IN 1986 AND COMING

536
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:01,730
TO BORK IN 1986 AND COMING FORWARD.

537
00:17:01,732 --> 00:17:03,599
FORWARD. WE HAVE A TREND LINE THAT LOOKS

538
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,634
WE HAVE A TREND LINE THAT LOOKS LIKE CRAP AND IT’S HEADED TO A

539
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:12,040
LIKE CRAP AND IT’S HEADED TO A BAD PLACE.

540
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,909
BAD PLACE. WE CAN DO HATFIELDS AND McCOYS

541
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,846
WE CAN DO HATFIELDS AND McCOYS FROM HERE ON OUT.

542
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,014
FROM HERE ON OUT. ULTIMATELY DR. FORD MADE

543
00:17:18,048 --> 00:17:19,949
ULTIMATELY DR. FORD MADE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE SENATE

544
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,484
ALLEGATIONS THAT THE SENATE NEEDED TO DELIBERATE ABOUT VERY

545
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:23,152
NEEDED TO DELIBERATE ABOUT VERY CAUTIOUSLY AND I THINK WE DID.

546
00:17:23,153 --> 00:17:24,620
CAUTIOUSLY AND I THINK WE DID. PEOPLE LIKE ME CALLED TO DELAY

547
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:26,355
PEOPLE LIKE ME CALLED TO DELAY THE VOTE, CALLED TO HAVE ANOTHER

548
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:28,657
THE VOTE, CALLED TO HAVE ANOTHER HEARING WITH HER, DULD HAVE A

549
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,226
HEARING WITH HER, DULD HAVE A SEVENTH FBI BACKGROUND

550
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:30,760
SEVENTH FBI BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION.

551
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:34,830
INVESTIGATION. I THINK PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL

552
00:17:34,832 --> 00:17:36,965
I THINK PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL AVENATTI WERE DOING SOMETHING

553
00:17:36,967 --> 00:17:37,433
AVENATTI WERE DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

554
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:39,168
DIFFERENT. WHEN YOU GET ACCUSED OF BEING

555
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:40,569
WHEN YOU GET ACCUSED OF BEING INVOLVED IN GANG RAPE AND YOUR

556
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,639
INVOLVED IN GANG RAPE AND YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE HEARING ALL THAT

557
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:44,774
DAUGHTERS ARE HEARING ALL THAT STUFF FROM THEIR FRIENDS, IT’S

558
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:45,508
STUFF FROM THEIR FRIENDS, IT’S UNDERSTANDABLE THAT SOMEBODY

559
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:46,742
UNDERSTANDABLE THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE OUTRAGED.

560
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,878
WOULD BE OUTRAGED. I WISH THE HEARING HAD GONE

561
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:50,513
I WISH THE HEARING HAD GONE QUITE DIFFERENTLY THAN IT DID

562
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:53,582
QUITE DIFFERENTLY THAN IT DID AND THERE’S LOTS OF BLAME TO GO

563
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:55,885
AND THERE’S LOTS OF BLAME TO GO AROUND ON WHY THE HEARING DID GO

564
00:17:55,886 --> 00:17:56,853
AROUND ON WHY THE HEARING DID GO THE WAY DID IT.

565
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:59,455
THE WAY DID IT. IT’S VERY UNORTHODOX NOW THAT

566
00:17:59,457 --> 00:18:01,057
IT’S VERY UNORTHODOX NOW THAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH WROTE THE OP-ED

567
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:03,293
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WROTE THE OP-ED HE DID AFTER THAT WHERE HE

568
00:18:03,294 --> 00:18:05,395
HE DID AFTER THAT WHERE HE PARTIALLY REPENNED FOR THE WAY

569
00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:07,264
PARTIALLY REPENNED FOR THE WAY HE PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THAT

570
00:18:07,298 --> 00:18:09,098
HE PRESENTED HIMSELF IN THAT HEARING WHERE HE SAID THERE

571
00:18:09,133 --> 00:18:10,433
HEARING WHERE HE SAID THERE SHOULD BE NO AISLE AT THE

572
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:14,103
SHOULD BE NO AISLE AT THE SUPREME COURT, NO CAUCUS ROOMS

573
00:18:14,104 --> 00:18:14,971
SUPREME COURT, NO CAUCUS ROOMS AT THE SUPREME COURT.

574
00:18:14,972 --> 00:18:17,173
AT THE SUPREME COURT. I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE’RE HEADED

575
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:21,778
I THINK WE ALL KNOW WE’RE HEADED TOWARDS AN UGLY RED AND BLUE

576
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:23,713
TOWARDS AN UGLY RED AND BLUE JERSEY PLACE IN THE JUDICIARY.

577
00:18:23,748 --> 00:18:26,115
JERSEY PLACE IN THE JUDICIARY. ONE GUY WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF

578
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,451
ONE GUY WHO HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF GANG RAPE AND SPEAKING ABOUT

579
00:18:27,485 --> 00:18:29,519
GANG RAPE AND SPEAKING ABOUT THAT AND LOSING HIS COOL I DON’T

580
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,920
THAT AND LOSING HIS COOL I DON’T THINK IS DISQUALIFYING.

581
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:32,321
THINK IS DISQUALIFYING. BUT I THINK IT WAS UNFORTUNATE

582
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:34,524
BUT I THINK IT WAS UNFORTUNATE AND I THINK JUSTICE KAVANAUGH

583
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,258
AND I THINK JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AGREES IT WAS UNFORTUNATE.

584
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:37,226
AGREES IT WAS UNFORTUNATE. >> ONE MORE QUICK QUESTION ABOUT

585
00:18:37,228 --> 00:18:38,995
>> ONE MORE QUICK QUESTION ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND THEN I’LL

586
00:18:38,996 --> 00:18:41,331
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND THEN I’LL ASK YOU ABOUT AN EASY QUESTION

587
00:18:41,332 --> 00:18:44,134
ASK YOU ABOUT AN EASY QUESTION HOW YOU ERASE A $20 TRILLION

588
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:44,501
HOW YOU ERASE A $20 TRILLION DEBT.

589
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,002
DEBT. ONE QUESTION ABOUT JUDGE

590
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:46,336
ONE QUESTION ABOUT JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

591
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,971
KAVANAUGH. THE MOST DISTURBING ANSWER, THE

592
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:49,806
THE MOST DISTURBING ANSWER, THE MOST DISTURBING PART OF

593
00:18:49,807 --> 00:18:51,241
MOST DISTURBING PART OF KAVANAUGH’S TESTIMONY WAS WHEN

594
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:55,045
KAVANAUGH’S TESTIMONY WAS WHEN HE WAS ASKED BY SENATOR HARRIS

595
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:56,313
HE WAS ASKED BY SENATOR HARRIS WHETHER CONGRESS OR THE

596
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:57,113
WHETHER CONGRESS OR THE PRESIDENT COULD BAN SOMEBODY

597
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:58,715
PRESIDENT COULD BAN SOMEBODY FROM ENTERING THE UNITED STATES

598
00:18:58,716 --> 00:19:00,250
FROM ENTERING THE UNITED STATES BASED SOLELY ON THEIR RACE.

599
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,619
BASED SOLELY ON THEIR RACE. HE REFUSED TO ANSWER THAT

600
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,422
HE REFUSED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, SAID THAT IT WAS STILL

601
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:06,623
QUESTION, SAID THAT IT WAS STILL BEFORE -- COULD STILL COME

602
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:07,824
BEFORE -- COULD STILL COME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT.

603
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:09,826
BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. I DON’T THINK THAT’S CORRECT, IS

604
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:10,226
I DON’T THINK THAT’S CORRECT, IS IT?

605
00:19:10,228 --> 00:19:13,263
IT? THE PRESIDENT’S FIRST TWO

606
00:19:13,298 --> 00:19:16,600
THE PRESIDENT’S FIRST TWO SO-CALLED TRAVEL BANS WERE

607
00:19:16,634 --> 00:19:17,734
SO-CALLED TRAVEL BANS WERE TRIATHLON OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE

608
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:18,435
TRIATHLON OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO RACE SPECIFIC.

609
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:20,771
TOO RACE SPECIFIC. >> I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE

610
00:19:20,805 --> 00:19:21,371
>> I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE SUBSTANCE.

611
00:19:21,373 --> 00:19:23,073
SUBSTANCE. CLEARLY THERE’S NOT A RACE BASED

612
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:24,241
CLEARLY THERE’S NOT A RACE BASED ARGUMENT FOR DOING THAT.

613
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:26,677
ARGUMENT FOR DOING THAT. >> YOU CAN’T DO IT UNDER THE

614
00:19:26,711 --> 00:19:27,111
>> YOU CAN’T DO IT UNDER THE CONSTITUTION.

615
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,345
CONSTITUTION. IT’S UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

616
00:19:28,346 --> 00:19:29,847
IT’S UNCONSTITUTIONAL. >> THAT’S WHAT I BELIEVE, YES.

617
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:31,982
>> THAT’S WHAT I BELIEVE, YES. THE CASES ARE STILL PENDING

618
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:33,951
THE CASES ARE STILL PENDING BECAUSE TRAVEL BAN THREE, I

619
00:19:33,985 --> 00:19:35,552
BECAUSE TRAVEL BAN THREE, I GUESS, THE LEGAL NERDS ARE

620
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,454
GUESS, THE LEGAL NERDS ARE CALLING IT NOW HAS PIECES OF IT

621
00:19:37,455 --> 00:19:39,189
CALLING IT NOW HAS PIECES OF IT THAT ARE STILL BEING LITIGATED

622
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,557
THAT ARE STILL BEING LITIGATED AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

623
00:19:40,592 --> 00:19:42,192
AND OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE

624
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:44,595
COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE THERE’S A LOT OF JIHADISM AND

625
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:47,031
THERE’S A LOT OF JIHADISM AND THAT’S A MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR

626
00:19:47,065 --> 00:19:49,266
THAT’S A MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR WHY PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO COME

627
00:19:49,267 --> 00:19:51,401
WHY PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO COME TO THE U.S., THE U.S. NATIONAL

628
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:52,503
TO THE U.S., THE U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY MEANS WE NEED TO

629
00:19:52,537 --> 00:19:55,840
SECURITY MEANS WE NEED TO CONTROL OUR BORDERS AND WE NEED

630
00:19:55,874 --> 00:19:59,310
CONTROL OUR BORDERS AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT COUNTRY DOES NOT

631
00:19:59,344 --> 00:20:01,712
TO LOOK AT WHAT COUNTRY DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT VETTING.

632
00:20:01,713 --> 00:20:02,846
HAVE SUFFICIENT VETTING. KILLING IN THE NAME OF RELIGION

633
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:04,315
KILLING IN THE NAME OF RELIGION IF THAT’S ONE OF YOUR MOIFRS

634
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:05,950
IF THAT’S ONE OF YOUR MOIFRS THAT CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE

635
00:20:05,984 --> 00:20:06,383
THAT CLEARLY NEEDS TO BE DELIBERATED.

636
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,018
DELIBERATED. I THINK KAVANAUGH WAS LARGELY

637
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,520
I THINK KAVANAUGH WAS LARGELY TRYING TO SAY THOSE CASES ARE

638
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:11,121
TRYING TO SAY THOSE CASES ARE STILL BEING DISCUSSED SO I DON’T

639
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:12,889
STILL BEING DISCUSSED SO I DON’T WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO THEM.

640
00:20:12,924 --> 00:20:15,192
WANT TO GET TOO CLOSE TO THEM. YOU’RE RIGHT RACE CAN’T BE ONE

641
00:20:15,193 --> 00:20:16,794
YOU’RE RIGHT RACE CAN’T BE ONE OF THOSE VARIABLES.

642
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,329
OF THOSE VARIABLES. >> FINALLY ON THE FEDERAL DEBT

643
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,530
>> FINALLY ON THE FEDERAL DEBT WHEN I GOT TO WASHINGTON THERE

644
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:22,233
WHEN I GOT TO WASHINGTON THERE WAS A $4 TRILLION NATIONAL DEBT,

THE TIME. I BELIEVE LOTS OF AMERICAN

675
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,384

POLITICAL TRIBALISM IS SO STUPID AND DANGEROUS IS THAT RIGHT NOW

PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE DEBT LIKE IT’S ONLY THE FAULT OF THE OTHER

PARTY WHEN THEY WERE IN POWER AND WHEN YOU TAKE BACK POWER

688
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,703
AND WHEN YOU TAKE BACK POWER YOU’RE JUST PLAYING DEFERS

00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,105
YOU’RE JUST PLAYING DEFERS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY

690

POLITICS AREN’T THE CENTER OF THE WORLD.

693
00:21:37,476 --> 00:21:40,011
THE WORLD. POLITICS HAS TO SOLVE THE

00:21:40,045 --> 00:21:42,480
POLITICS HAS TO SOLVE THE ENTITLEMENT CRISIS.

695
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:44,282

ENTITLEMENT REFORM IS ONE OF THOSE BASIC THINGS.

THOSE BASIC THINGS. IT’S HARD TO FIND PEOPLE WHO

IT’S HARD TO FIND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK TOGETHER BETWEEN

708
00:22:05,004 --> 00:22:06,938
WANT TO WORK TOGETHER BETWEEN BLUE AND RED TRIBE BECAUSE THEY
