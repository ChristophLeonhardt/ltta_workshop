it's our seventh full day here in Israel and today we're touring the border wall and the security fence now only five percent of the security fence is actually concrete wall in the places where there is concrete wall it's in open areas to prevent shooting from the inside from harming Israelis that live on the outside now the wall itself is 9 meters high and 45 centimeters thick now it's 9 meters high because nobody jumps from 9 meters somebody would have to lower themselves down and that can give the Israeli soldiers time to intercept the person coming down the wall now I want to show you right over here this building behind me is actually a security terminal it's one of the so called checkpoints and within that checkpoint a thousand people per day can pass through that one checkpoint alone and within that checkpoint it's entirely automated because as the man who built the wall explained to us Colonel Danny tearsa he said that it is automated to maintain the dignity of the people passing through the wall where they can pass through something that resembles airport security instead of being searched at gunpoint by Israeli soldiers now it's in the terminal the Israeli soldiers have to work behind bulletproof glass because the potential for a terror attack within the terminal has been built into the terminal itself the top of the building you can see the overhang the awning there it's open and the reason it's open is that if a suicide bombing happens within the terminal the percussion can be dissipated and it will cause less damage to the building itself so within that terminal that allows a thousand people per day to get through it or a thousand people per hour excuse me to get through it the only people working in apartheid are the Israeli soldiers for the rebel media I'm Shiela gunnery it's day seven of our trip here to Israel today we're touring the security fence and the security wall to see all of our coverage from on the ground go to rebel Israel calm you
