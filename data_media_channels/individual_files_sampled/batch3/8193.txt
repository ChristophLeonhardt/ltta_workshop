BARBECUE, WORE RED, WHITE, AND BLUE AND WAS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS. RELAXING DAY TO CELEBRATE THIS GREAT NATION WE LIVE. IN. NOT RESISTING. STEVE: MICHAEL MOORE AND CHELSEA HANDLER AND BETTE MIDLER. USUAL SUSPECTS. STEVE: TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS A HORRIBLE PRESIDENT. NOVEMBER IS COMING. ROB REINER TWEETED THIS OUT THE GREATEST GIFT WE CAN BIRTHDAY IS THE SURVIVAL OF DEMOCRACY VERSUS AUTHORITARIANISM AND RACISM ARE FIGHTING TO DESTROY IT. NOW TIME FOR PATRIOTS TO WE LOVE YOU, AMERICA. THANK YOU, ROB REINER. I WOULD SAY PATRIOTS ARE STANDING UP AND HAVING THEIR SITTING IN THE OVAL OFFICE. STEVE: DRIVING THEM CRAZY. DRIVING THEM ABSOLUTELY INSANE. HOLLYWOOD HAS ACTED ALMOST AS A MEGAPHONE FOR THE LEFT. NOT JUST HOLLYWOOD TWEETING. THIS ALSO A TWEET FROM KAMALA HARRIS ABOUT ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN SUPPORT OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. THIS GREAT NATION, OUR TROOPS, THE MANY TROOPS THAT ARE STILL ALIVE THAT FOUGHT IN WARS, THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO IT. THEY DON'T DEFEAT THE NOTION WHATSOEVER THAT WE ALL FEEL THE LEFT IS UNAMERICAN AND HOLLYWOOD IS JUST A MEGA PHONE FOR THEM. BRIAN: WHAT I THINK I FIND MOST DISTURBING I LOVE THAT ROB REINER SAYS SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT AMERICA BEFORE HE CLOSED OUT. FOR THE MOST PART ALL YOU GET IS CRITICS AND ANGER. THEY SAY AMERICA IS BASED ON PROTESTS. "U.S.A. TODAY" IN THE "NEW YORK TIMES," THEY DON'T TELL YOU ABOUT CELEBRATING BUT HOW TO START YOUR OWN PROTEST. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. IT'S REALLY ABHORRENT BEHAVIOR. FURTHER AWAY FROM DEMOCRATS AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE LEFT AND MORE ON OUR SIDE. THAT'S THE OPTIMISM. THAT'S THE SILVER LINING IN ALL OF THIS. AINSLEY: THERE ARE BLACK FEMALE LEADERS WHO ARE CRITICIZED NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER FOR NOT PROTECTING WHAT THEY SAY. MAXINE WATERS. THIS IS WHAT THE LETTER FROM DISAPPOINTMENT OVER RECENT FAILURE TO PROTECT CONGRESSWOMAN WATERS FROM UNWARRANTED ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS IN THE G.O.P. THAT FAILURE WAS FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY YOUR DECISION TO UNFAIRLY DERIDE HER AS I ACTUALLY LOVED. THIS BECAUSE THE LEFT CREATED THE BLACK CARD. AND NOW THEY HAVE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE, THIS WHEN YOU SAY THAT A BLACK WOMAN CANNOT BE CRITICIZED WHATSOEVER DESPITE WHAT SHE DOES. MAXINE WATERS WAS PATENTLY WRONG. REMARKS WERE UNCIVIL AND INSPIRING HATRED TOWARD NOT THAT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. SO HE THIS WERE RIGHT TO CONDEMN HEAR AND SHE WAS ROUNDLY CONDEMNED ACROSS THE BOARD. SHE HAD SOME PEOPLE PLAY THE BLACK CARD. THEY HAVE TO CONTEND WITH THAT THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY CREATED THAT I SPEAK OUT AGAINST SAYING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE CIVIL DESPITE THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN YOU CAN DO SOMETHING WRONG IN THIS COUNTRY. I THOUGHT THIS WAS THE LEFT EATING ITS OWN AND NANCY PELOSI, I SAW RESPONDED AND SHE ISSUED A STATEMENT ESSENTIALLY BACKING MAXINE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE IS BLACK. BRIAN: MOST GETTABLE SECTION OF THE VOTING BASE IS GOING DIFFERENTLY? ANOTHER RELEVANT GROUP GOING TO HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD IN THE MID TERMS, WHO ARE THEY? ABSOLUTELY. I MOST RECENTLY TWEETED THE BLACK VOTE IS GOING TO BECOME THE MOST RELEVANT VOTE IN AMERICA BY 2020. WE ARE SEEING A MAJOR SHIFT. AINSLEY: WHY IS THAT? THE CONVERSATION IS DIFFERENT. I THINK DIGITAL MEDIA HAS ALLOWED FOR THIS. FOR SO LONG WE WERE TRAPPED. AND WE SAW THE VERSION OF SOCIETY THAT CNN PROJECTED TOWARDS US. NOW WE HAVE SOCIAL MEDIA. NOW THEY ARE HEARING VOICES WRONG FACTS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THEIR TV SCREENS. AND THEY ARE SEEING PEOPLE VERSION. YOUTUBE, ON FACEBOOK, ON TWITTER USING DIFFERENT SOMETHING THATS. THERE IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR BLACK EXIT FROM THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ACTUALLY COMPETE FOR THEIR VOTES IN 2020. STEVE: WHEN DONALD TRUMP WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT HAVE TO LOSE. HE WAS CORRECT. WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN AND WE'RE GAINING IT. AINSLEY: CANDACE, YOU GREW AINSLEY: DID I GROW UP TO THINK THAT REPUBLICANS WERE RACIST. I DID. AINSLEY: WHY DID YOU SWITCH SPEARTS. WHY DID YOU BECOME REPUBLICAN. IT WASN'T A WHY. IT WAS UNDERSTANDING THAT RACISM AS DONALD TRUMP WAS RUNNING WAS BEING USED AS A THEME TO TRAP TRUMP VOTERS. HE WAS LOVED BY THE HIP HOP WORLD. EVERY SONG I LISTENED TO GROWING UP CELEBRATED DONALD TRUMP AND MAR-A-LAGO. HE WAS THE GOAL. THE MOMENT HE DECIDED TO RUN FOR THE PRESIDENT MOMENT HE BRIAN: HE WAS THROUGH THE ROOF MINORITY AND HISPANICS. WE LOVED HIM. BRIAN: WHAT COULD THE ADMINISTRATION DO BETTER TO VOTES OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. I THINK THEY ARE DOING A TREMENDOUS JOB IN JUST SLASHING REGULATIONS, GIVING OPPORTUNITIES TO BLACK AMERICANS AGAIN. TACKLING THE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT SITUATION, THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS BLACK PEOPLE BEYOND ANY OTHER GROUP IN THIS SOCIETY. STEVE: WHAT ABOUT BREAD AND BUTTER NUMBERS WHEN THIS COMES TOWN EMPLOYMENT, RECORD LOW. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M SPEAKING ABOUT. EXACTLY. THAT'S BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE OUT. THAT'S WHAT I'M FOR. THAT'S WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON. BEEN WORKING ON A MAJOR PROJECT THAT WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS THAT IS GOING TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET URBAN COMMUNITIES AND SORT OF BRING THEM THIS GREAT AWAKENING THAT I SEE HAPPENING. AINSLEY: GET OUT YOUR
