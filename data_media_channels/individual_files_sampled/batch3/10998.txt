UK has a new foreign secretary following the resignation of Boris Johnson has been replaced by Jeremy Hunt there's been a string of departures by key brexit ears over the government's adoption of a softer approach to leaving the EU the new Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been serving as the country's health secretary for the past six years he supported the remain campaign during the 2016 brexit referendum though he claims to have since become a brexit ear as Boris Johnson was leaving his official residence in central London after his resignation he was bombarded with questions from reporters do you think we now go live to understeer Churkin uh now things are pretty chaotic in terms of UK politics right now aren't they well sure it's definitely quite chaotic times here in Britain Jackie first of all we do of course have brexit looming with really just months to go before it becomes a reality and here we are in a situation where Teresa Mae's cabinet certainly seems to be in a state of disarray not only do we have two of the top ministers connected to brexit coming and going three ministers in total really gone almost in a blink of an eye and a total of seven cabinet ministers that have departed in a span of a year and of course it seems quite clear that if it's one more hiccup it looks very likely that a vote of no-confidence will be showing Teresa may the door and while all of this is unraveling at home the situation with talks with the rest of the European Union about what's going to happen also seem to be leaving much to be desired politicians come and go but the problems they have created for the people remain and the mess caused by bracket is the biggest problem in the history of you UK relations and it is still very far from being solved with or without mr. Davies and unfortunately the idea of regs it hasn't left together with deputies well and obviously other political disasters here in the UK have not been making life easy for Theresa May first of course we did see a snap election that was expected to be a success but turned out to be an embarrassment we saw massive problems Williford Teresa made with a grand felt our disaster with people here quite unhappy with the way that situation was handled by the British prime minister and of course last but very far from least is the whole novel shock saga that has been unraveling over the last several months we're now especially with the second incident of a poisoning of that officials here are connecting to Nava choc and with one woman dead some people are continuing to push the whole Russian narrative but it's becoming increasingly clear that evidence will need to be provided sooner or later agent that's being used in this incident is the same as the March the fourth incident but we have not the scientists have not been able to identify or determine if it is the same batch so it may well be but at this point that is not known the simple reality is that Russia has committed an attack on British soil which is seeing the death of a British citizen that is something that I think the world will unite with us in actually condemning well exactly because all of this is indeed unraveling on British soil it seems quite clear that the British government here in London has quite a lot to sort out and quickly parties Anastacio Turkana staying across all the ups and downs of Theresa Mays government thank you very much you
