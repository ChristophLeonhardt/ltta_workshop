1
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,446
JESSE: HE'S PUTTING HIS FOOT IN

2
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:14,149
HIS MOUTH ONE WEEK AFTER

3
00:00:14,149 --> 00:00:15,917
SNAPPING AT A REPORTER FOR

4
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:18,787
ASKING IF HE APOLOGIZED TO

5
00:00:18,787 --> 00:00:20,455
MONICA LEWINSKY.

6
00:00:20,455 --> 00:00:23,492
>> I THINK THE NORMS HAVE REALLY

7
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:25,494
CHANGED IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CAN

8
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:26,795
DO TO SOMEBODY AGAINST THEIR

9
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:27,896
WILL.

10
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:32,767
HOW MUCH YOU CAN CROWD THEIR

11
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,669
SPACE AND MAKE THEM MISERABLE AT

12
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:35,003
WORK.

13
00:00:35,003 --> 00:00:37,439
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PHYSICALLY

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,308
ASSAULTED SOMEONE TO MAKE THEM

15
00:00:40,308 --> 00:00:42,410
UNCOMFORTABLE AT WORK OR AT HOME

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,712
OR WALKING AROUND.

17
00:00:43,712 --> 00:00:46,781
JESSE: BILL WENT ON TO SAY IT'S

18
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,683
A GOOD THING THE NORMS HAVE

19
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:49,551
CHANGED.

20
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:53,922
BUT HERE TO RESPOND, DIAMOND AND

21
00:00:53,922 --> 00:00:54,222
SILK.

22
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:56,491
HE NEEDS TO STOP TALKING ABOUT

23
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:56,791
THIS.

24
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,594
>> HE'S EMBARRASSING HIMSELF.

25
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:00,929
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE MIGHT BE

26
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,131
HAVING AN OUT OF MIND, OUT OF

27
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:03,698
TOUCH EXPERIENCE.

28
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,467
MAYBE HE'S TRYING TO COME CLEAN

29
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:07,869
ABOUT WHAT HE DID IN THE PAST

30
00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:11,973
AND CLEAR HIS CONSCIENCE.

31
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:13,308
HE'LL PROBABLY NEVER BE

32
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:14,543
PROSECUTED FOR ANYTHING.

33
00:01:14,543 --> 00:01:17,679
HE SHOULD BE IN A TIME OUT.

34
00:01:17,679 --> 00:01:20,582
WHEREVER HE IS SITTING.

35
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:23,018
>> IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S HAVING A

36
00:01:23,018 --> 00:01:25,720
COME TO JESUS MOMENT.

37
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,857
JESSE: WATCH TONIGHTA BROADDRICK

38
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:31,393
HAD THIS TO SAY.

39
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:32,827
SO BILL CLINTON THINKS HE SHOULD

40
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:35,497
GET A PASS BECAUSE IT WAS 1978

41
00:01:35,497 --> 00:00:00,000
WHEN HE RAPED ME AND HE KNOWS
