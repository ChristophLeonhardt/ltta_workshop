1
00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:02,080
MIGHT AND EASES ON REPORTS THAT

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,281
TALKS ARE GROWING WELL.

3
00:00:03,281 --> 00:00:04,783
THEY'RE COMING BACK TOMORROW

4
00:00:04,783 --> 00:00:05,684
NIGHT.

5
00:00:05,684 --> 00:00:07,352
WE'LL KNOW TOMORROW NIGHT.

6
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:10,455
MEANTIME, ANOTHER DEADLINE FAST

7
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:10,855
APPROACHING.

8
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:12,123
THAT IS ON THIS IRAN DEAL AND

9
00:00:12,123 --> 00:00:13,158
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

10
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:14,859
A LITTLE MORE THAN A WEEK AWAY

11
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:16,161
DETERMINING ON THE PART OF THE

12
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,796
PRESIDENT WHETHER HE WANTS TO

13
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:20,065
NIX THE DEAL IN PLACE OR FIX THE

14
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:20,799
ONE THAT IS.

15
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:21,633
ALL RIGHT.

16
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:27,439
FORMER U.S. ARMY INTELLIGENCE

17
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,008
OFFICER JOINING US.

18
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:32,043
MICHAEL, FRENCH AND GERMAN

19
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:33,645
LEADERS SAID WE PUT TOO MUCH IN

20
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:35,680
THIS TO RISK STARTING FROM

21
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,114
SCRATCH.

22
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:37,682
THERE'S THINGS THAT WE CAN FIX.

23
00:00:37,682 --> 00:00:40,085
THE PRESIDENT SAYS NO, IT WAS A

24
00:00:40,085 --> 00:00:41,886
DISASTER FROM THE GET-GO.

25
00:00:41,886 --> 00:00:43,221
WHAT DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO

26
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:43,521
DO?

27
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,856
>> HE'S GOING TO WALK AWAY.

28
00:00:44,856 --> 00:00:46,958
THANKS FOR HAVING ME, NEIL.

29
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:48,493
HE'S GOING TO WALK AWAY.

30
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:50,862
MACRON HAS SAID IT BEST.

31
00:00:50,862 --> 00:00:53,398
IF THERE'S NOT FIXES TO THE

32
00:00:53,398 --> 00:00:55,500
JCPOA, IRAN WILL BECOME NORTH

33
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,368
KOREA IN TEN YEARS.

34
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:58,503
THE PRESIDENT WILL WALK AWAY

35
00:00:58,503 --> 00:01:01,740
BASED ON WHAT BOLTON AND POMPEO

36
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,542
ARE ADVISING HIM AND THE

37
00:01:04,542 --> 00:01:05,644
BRIEFING THAT NETANYAHU GAVE

38
00:01:05,644 --> 00:01:06,044
LAST WEEK.

39
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:07,312
>> Neil: AND THEN WHAT?

40
00:01:07,312 --> 00:01:11,016
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY -- I KNOW

41
00:01:11,016 --> 00:01:14,819
THIS WAS NOT THE KIND OF THING

42
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,023
THAT -- SINCE IT WAS NOT

43
00:01:18,023 --> 00:01:19,524
RATIFIED BY CONGRESS, WE COULD

44
00:01:19,524 --> 00:01:22,160
WALK AWAY IF WE WANT TO, BUT

45
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,862
CRITICS SAY BE CAREFUL BECAUSE

46
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:26,097
THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T TRUST

47
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:28,366
THE AMERICANS.

48
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:30,335
ONE PRESIDENT AND THE NEXT GUY

49
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:32,237
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

50
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:35,440
>> THIS GIVES US LEVERAGE WITH

51
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,508
NORTH KOREAN.

52
00:01:36,508 --> 00:01:38,276
KIM JONG-UN WANTED AN IRAN-LIKE

53
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:38,576
DEAL.

54
00:01:38,576 --> 00:01:40,078
HE WAS BANKING ON THAT.

55
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:41,880
THIS GIVES US LEVERAGE.

56
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,982
WE'RE TEARING UP A BAD DEAL AND

57
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:46,084
GOING IN FROM A POSITION OF

58
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:46,451
STRENGTH.

59
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:48,553
I THINK IT GIVES US LEVERAGE.

60
00:01:48,553 --> 00:01:50,322
THAT'S A WEAK ARGUMENT FROM THE

61
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:51,990
OTHER SIDE.

62
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,125
>> Neil: BUT I'M CURIOUS, TIM

63
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:57,128
MONEY GUY HERE AT FOX, THE NERDY

64
00:01:57,128 --> 00:01:57,595
GUY.

65
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:58,930
IRAN HAS THEIR MONEY, A

66
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,464
MONEY.

67
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,899
>> RIGHT.

68
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,167
>> Neil: SO WHAT IS THE

69
00:02:02,167 --> 00:02:03,735
INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO SAY, ALL

70
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:05,303
RIGHT, SURE, LET'S RENEGOTIATE

71
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:07,872
THIS OR GET INVOLVED IN THIS?

72
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:09,441
>> THEY SQUANDERED THAT'S MONEY.

73
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:11,142
THAT'S WHAT THE PROTESTS ARE

74
00:02:11,142 --> 00:02:11,443
ABOUT.

75
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,845
THE IRANIAN MONEY HAVE SAID THE

76
00:02:13,845 --> 00:02:15,046
REGIME SQUANDERED THE ECONOMIC

77
00:02:15,046 --> 00:02:17,449
BENEFITS OF THE IRAN DEAL, THE

78
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:18,917
$150 BILLION.

79
00:02:18,917 --> 00:02:19,584
IT'S GONE.

80
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:20,985
IT WENT TO BALLISTIC MISSILE

81
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:24,222
TESTING AND EXPORTING OF

82
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:25,156
TERRORISM.

83
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:27,225
PROTESTERS ARE STOP PAYING

84
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:34,065
ATTENTION TO IRAQ, SYRIA AND

85
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:36,768
LEBANON AND PAY ATTENTION TO US.

86
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,436
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE

87
00:02:38,436 --> 00:02:42,240
TRILLION GOING TO A REGIME TO

88
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,608
CONTINUE BALLISTIC MISSILE

89
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:45,910
TESTING, THE EXPORT OF

90
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,277
TERRORISM.

91
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:49,614
ALL THE WHILE, AT THE END OF A

92
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:51,783
SUNSET CLAUSE, IT'S A NUCLEAR

93
00:02:51,783 --> 00:02:54,119
NORTH KOREA.

94
00:02:54,119 --> 00:02:56,788
THAT'S THE REASON TO WALK AWAY

95
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:57,389
FROM THE JCPOA.

96
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,324
IF YOU WANT TO HURT THE REGIME,

97
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,059
TAKE THE JCPOA AWAY.

98
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:03,228
EUROPE IS NOT INVESTING NOW.

99
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,763
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO INVEST IN

100
00:03:04,763 --> 00:03:06,364
IRAN WHEN THE U.S. HAS WALKED

101
00:03:06,364 --> 00:03:07,499
AWAY FROM IT.

102
00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:09,100
IRAN'S ECONOMY IS NOT WORTH IT.

103
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,202
DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH THEY

104
00:03:11,202 --> 00:03:12,404
HATE THE PRESIDENT, IT'S NOT

105
00:03:12,404 --> 00:03:15,640
WORTH HURTING A EUROPE FOR A

106
00:03:15,640 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT THAT COULD BE GONE IN
