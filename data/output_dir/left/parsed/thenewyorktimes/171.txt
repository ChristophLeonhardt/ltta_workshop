This is Stephon Clark, lying
on the ground, motionless
after two Sacramento
police officers shot him
seven times.
He was a 22-year-old father of
two boys. An unarmed black man.
Killed in his own backyard.
And it all happened
in just 23 seconds.
We’re going to break
down those 23 seconds
and look at five
critical moments.
Our frame-by-frame
analysis reveals
a series of split-second
decisions and errors,
and examines how they
ended in Clark’s death.
A warning: It can be hard to watch.
First, let’s play the whole
encounter. Pay attention
to how quickly it escalates.
It all starts earlier
around 9:10 p.m.,
when a resident
calls 911 and reports
that someone is
vandalizing cars.
Then, 16 minutes later,
a police helicopter
spots a suspect.
This is Stephon Clark.
The police footage doesn’t
show Clark break a window.
But the police say they
believe he was responsible
for the reported vandalism.
Clark jumps a
fence into this yard.
He lived here with
his grandmother,
although there’s no
reason to think that
the police knew this.
Moments later, we see two
police officers approach
the front of the house.
Police have not confirmed
the officers’ identities,
so we’ll call them
Officer 1 and Officer 2.
The helicopter guides
them toward Clark.
Officer 1 has his gun drawn
before he encounters Clark.
We slowed down and
brightened this clip
to see it more clearly.
This is just before
the officer first shouts,
starting the
crucial 23 seconds
as the officers begin pursuit.
Clark is standing along
the side of the house,
while the officers
are at the front.
Officer 1 sees
Clark and shouts.
Clark runs farther
into his backyard.
He moves under a covered
patio and stays there
for the next 13 seconds.
The officers chase Clark and
run around a blind corner,
breathing hard.
Their speed may
have robbed them
of a chance to de-escalate
the situation from a safe spot,
which would be
in line with
their department’s 
instructions.
The chaos of the
full-on pursuit
could have been a factor
in the next critical moment,
when one of the officers
mistakenly thinks
that Clark has a weapon.
Officer 1 is now about
40 feet away from Clark.
We’ll freeze on this frame.
It’s difficult to see,
but right here,
this is Stephon Clark
facing Officer 1.
We can tell he’s stopped
and facing the officer,
but we can’t see much
else, including whether
he has anything in his hands.
Here’s the moment from the
helicopter’s perspective.
Less than two seconds after
coming around the corner,
Officer 1 shouts
the word “Gun.”
So, why in that brief
moment did the officer
conclude that Clark, who
was unarmed, had a gun?
We don’t know.
Both officers backtracked
behind the corner
and then looked
back around it.
Officer 1 again concludes
that Clark is armed.
And immediately after that,
his partner decides to fire.
Why? Possibly because he
saw Clark’s movements.
Remember, Clark
had been stopped,
but as the officers retreat,
he begins moving
in their direction.
When they look around
the corner again,
he’s closer, around 25
feet away from the officers
and continuing to move.
Clark is stepping through
a narrow space
between a picnic table
and the house, likely turned
and not directly
facing the officers.
We drew this
conclusion in part
by comparing the body camera
to this picture of Clark
from earlier in the same day.
Notice the pants
with white stripes —
the same ones seen
in the body camera.
But nothing in the
videos can tell us
why Clark moved.
Overhead from the helicopter
we see him as well.
That small cluster
of white pixels.
That’s all we can see of
Clark before shots are fired.
Less than a second
after Officer 1 called
out a gun for the
second time, Officer 2
fires the first series
of five bullets.
After a short
pause, both officers
shoot a combined
15 more times.
Let’s look at that again
from the helicopter.
The first volley is fired
while Clark stands.
He falls to his
hands and knees.
He’s still moving as the
second round of shots begins,
and then, by the
time it’s over,
he’s motionless.
So, which shots killed Clark?
The ones fired while
he was standing
or those fired while
he was on the ground?
In early May, the
Sacramento County coroner
released its autopsy report,
concluding that Clark was shot
seven times.
By combining the report 
with our analysis
we determined that Clark
was struck in his left leg
while still standing,
a non-lethal shot.
He was also struck
six more times,
all on the right side
and back.
These shots broke his ribs,
fractured his spine,
lacerated his heart,
perforated his lungs
and killed him.
Given Clark’s position,
orientation and movement,
these last six shots
almost certainly
hit Clark while he was falling
or lying on the ground.
We don’t know exactly how
long it took these wounds
to kill Clark, but we
do know that there
was a significant delay before
any medical aid was given.
“Show me your hands.”
“Let’s see your hands.”
After they stopped firing,
the officers don’t
approach Clark.
They talk to either each other
or to Clark’s unresponsive body,
which they still consider
a threat.
“You all right, you hit?”
“Yeah, I’m good.”
Two minutes after the shooting,
other officers arrive.
“You can’t see his
hands, right?”
The police discuss using
a body bunker, a shield
to protect themselves
from gunfire.
“Three-Sam-five 
if you can head this way,
we could use a body bunker
before we detain him.”
Almost three minutes
after the last shot,
the police identify themselves
for the first time.
“Hey, can you hear us?”
“Police Department,
can you hear us?”
“We need to know 
if you’re OK.
We need to get you
medics, but we can’t
go over to get you help
unless we know
you don’t have a weapon.”
Officer 1 describes the
moment when they fired.
“He came up and then he, he kind
of approached us hands out.
And then, fell down.”
Four minutes and 50 seconds
after the shooting,
officers approach Clark.
“One of you guys want to go hands,
cover ’em, I — oh, fuck.”
They handcuff him,
which is a standard practice.
And when they roll him
over, his cellphone
is lying under his body.
This suggests a
possibility: that Clark
had the phone in his hand
and that’s what the
officers mistook for a gun.
The police now have the
phone but have not said
whether he was recording.
“Give me a light, 
we’ll start CPR.”
“All right.”
Six minutes after the
last bullet was fired,
officers not involved in
the shooting give first aid.
Clark is pronounced
dead at the scene.
Officers 1 and 2 step away
and mute their cameras.
“Hey, mute.”
We can no longer hear what
they’re discussing.
Shortly after 
the shooting,
the Sacramento
Police Department
updated its guidelines.
Officers are now required
to record why they mute
or turn off their cameras.
The officers were placed on
paid administrative leave
and then returned 
to desk duty on April 9.
And the investigation
is ongoing.
