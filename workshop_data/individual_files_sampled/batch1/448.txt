she was 44 a mother of three children with no apparent links to the Espionage drama that has engulfed this quiet city yet dawn sturgis became the first murder victim and one of the most troubling poisoning cases in recent times that is both shocking and utterly appalling that a British citizen has died having been exposed to another choke nerve agent though make no mistake we are determined to find out how dawn and her partner Charlie Charlie Rowley came into contact with such a deadly substance and we will do everything we possibly can to bring those responsible to justice more than 100 counterterrorism police officers are involved in the investigation they are working on the theory that the latest victims handled the container used to carry the nerve agent that poisoned Russian double agent said gas creeped out and his daughter Yulia the UK authorities still hold Russia responsible but while Kremlin officials offered sympathies for the victim they have denied any involvement anyone mentioning Russia in the context of the second poisoning in the UK Russia being mentioned by anyone or being associated with it we suppose it would be quite absurd anyway meanwhile Salisbury remains a city in a state of nervousness as just behind me here earlier on Monday the road closed because a man had taken ill on a bus there is no confirmation that it has anything to do with another truck poisoning here but it just goes to show that police here are taking absolutely no chances yep there are those here who are trying to remain composed it can be a little bit worrying but I think we've got the best people around we've got putting down down the road we've got the hospital down the road and we've got the best people we can life is what it is if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time you may or may not survive isn't it a bit weird because the other ones didn't go over these ones didn't so nice here there's new dangerous for the public but you know they are the public and it died saying and the wait goes on for more definitive answers to this deeply troubling incident Sonya guy a go al-jazeera Salisbury
