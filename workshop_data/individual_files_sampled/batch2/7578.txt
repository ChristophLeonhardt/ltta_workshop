Before we jump into the next clip I just want to tell you real quick we got a new audio network go to TYT dot-com slash audio and get all of our new podcasts a federal judge has ruled to block the release of the downloadable blueprints that would allow people to essentially print guns on 3d printers now this was set to take effect August 1st meaning tomorrow people would be able to access those blueprints and then print guns on these 3d printers but luckily this federal judge in Seattle has issued a temporary restraining order to stop the release of the blueprints and by the way these guns would be untraceable and undetectable they would be made of materials that wouldn't be detected through a metal detector and untraceable because they wouldn't have serial codes on them or anything that would allow the authorities to trace them now who is the person behind these blueprints who's trying to make this you know widely available to Americans man by the name of Cody Wilson defense distributed announced its plans to make 3d gun blueprints including a single-shot pistol called The Liberator an ar-15 low lower receiver and a complete Beretta m9 handgun available on August 1st and by the way they thought they were gonna be able to do this because they reached a settlement with the federal government under the trump administration they tried to get this approved under the Obama administration and of course it didn't get approved under Trump it did get approved but it seems like Trump didn't know anything about it now keep in mind that the NRA is not necessarily in favor of this because it means weapons manufacturers the very weapons manufacturers that fund their organizations are gonna lose money because then you can just go ahead and print a gun with a 3d printer right so here's what Trump had to say about this whole ordeal I am looking into 3d plastic guns being sold to the public already spoke to NRA doesn't seem to make much sense your federal government reach this settlement with the guy who's trying to make these blueprints legal widely available you did that you did that I mean it's incredible ok I gotta give you two toll juice so first told you is when this 3d a gun printing story came out that they were the Trump government was going to allow it I remember John and I discussed it on the show and I said the NRA is not gonna like this they're in favor of every lacs gun regulation there is and this is obviously lacks gun regulation hey everybody can have a gun and their whole argument is the Second Amendment I gotta protect myself against the government right we said NRA wouldn't like it turns out Trump there admits to the tweet he spoke to that NRA and they don't like it why cuz they don't give a damn about your rights they don't even care about the Second Amendment at all all they care is are we making money for weapons manufacturers because those are the people who fund us if they're not making money then screw your second Amendment rights no I don't want you to get a 3d gun printed ok I want you to buy it from the guys who are bribing me yeah that as well a lot of times the NRA will be actually have positions that were opposed to their members 77% of their members want federal background checks the NRA says no then my gun manufacturers won't be able to sell enough guns so I I don't care what my members say what do you think I actually give a damn about you know where's the money Lebowski that's all they're in our a is it's deeply corrupt now ii told you is trump after the shooting in Florida came out and said well I'm gonna be tough on there and all right you know these Republican governors and Senators can't do it but I could become gonna be tough I said no he's not they're gonna tell him hey idiot they gave you 30 million dollars during the election they gave 50 million to the Republican Party overall bow your head and Trump's on an actual alpha-male he's just stupid he didn't think the check who how much the NRA had given him couple of days later he comes out and he's like god no I mean no but we don't really need to do any of that stuff yeah whatever then RA says I told you and then look at this tweet he says I check with the NRA and they say they're not you're so stupid amazing you're not supposed to say I checked with the NRA you're not supposed to say I checked with my donors and they gave me my orders because I work for them you're supposed to hide that and pretend that you came to a principled conclusion on this besides which it was your federal government who agreed to this settlement with Cody Wilson the guy who wants to publish these blueprints right by the way not only did they tell him yeah yeah effective August 1st you can publish those blueprints they even paid his legal fees to the tune of $40,000 but he doesn't know about this oh I looked into 3d guns for the first time ever after reaching the settlement I knew your goddamn homework man just but nobody can tell him anything cuz he doesn't care to do the job you think he knew about that case like people assume that he knows the things that we know in the news no he doesn't he's an empty-headed fool you think he's asking about any federal rulings you think he even knows what a federal ruling is judges why do we need judge oh I mean he literally said why do we need judges he said what are they gonna get him from a barbershop why would they get the from a barbershop why would they do that moron as president and obviously corrupt so look but the great irony of all this is that at the end of the day we're always trying to be principled here and so as much as I despise that rnai despise Trump and for completely different reasons we're coming to the same conclusion do not do the 3d printed guns I know they care about making money off of death right that's their concern my concern is less death I mean the liberator who you're going to liberate you're gonna liberate somebody from their lives right so the whole idea of this is oh well you know my second Amendment I'm in the woods and I printed my gun and and the government's coming to get me so look let's just be clear in your plan you would be murdering government officials well ok Cody Wilson again the person behind all this the person who wants to publish the blueprints online has said some pretty terrible things done some pretty terrible things we have some videos to prove it let's go to the first video of Cody Wilson Joe Biden this is no country for old man okay no no that's look if we had any sanity in the country he'd immediately be arrested you can't threaten to kill government officials like that and they brag about it yeah and if he had said Mike Pence and then said this is what I think I'm Mike Pence and shot a gun Secret Service should be at his door the very next day whether it's Pence Trump Biden or Obama you can't these lunatics are going around like celebrating the idea of murdering people who work in the government it's not a thing to be celebrated also I mean with all the shootings that have happened in you know crowded events think about the fact that metal detectors wouldn't even you know detect these guns they would be made of materials that wouldn't be detected so that's a that's a terrifying situation to deal with there's only two people or sets of people who want guns without serial numbers one is criminals obviously and the other is lunatics waiting in the woods to do some sort of armed revolution against government you know like people just assume like oh that's a normal thing oh yeah that's what the second amendments for no that would mean that you would wait in the woods and murder what cops they're the government officials with the guns right with the authority you would murder FBI officials you would murder people in the military and then you want to talk about NFL players taking a knee during anthems you're planning to murder all these law enforcement officials while you're sitting in the woods with your gun that you print it out cuz let speak that's that's what you're saying right I mean well I just covered it was purely man so that's what murdered all those cops by the way it's not theoretical that there are crazed right-wing groups that do go around killing cops there's dozens of these stories is the one that always that I remember that sticks out to me was the guy god sorry I'm sorry to interrupt you this is breaking he had already posted the online blueprints so this is according to CBS it wasn't supposed to happen before midnight tonight but it turns out the founder of the radical pro-gun group has already posted online blueprints for using 3d print to make guns luckily it's pretty expensive now and the guys in the woods can't afford to figure out a 3d printer but someone will have it some of them will have it and now it's out in the world and by the way he had posted it before before the government told him not to and it or had already been downloaded millions of times and including by America's enemies so the patriotic guy yeah yeah so just in the story I was telling was that in Vegas guy right-winger shoots two cops dead he does it he says he does it for freedom and then he lays down a Gadson flag over their dead bodies the gas in the flag is the one that says don't tread on me so these lunatics they're already out there and they're killing cops and then you tell me about how blue lives matter and now he's got the Tea Party put it online are there gonna be consequences for it that's what I want to know right I mean even if the judge had not blocked it which the judge in Seattle did block it he still posted it before he was supposed to so are there are there ever gonna be consequences for anyone on the right and and by the way if you go to arrest the guy for violating an order if he did right what's he gonna do oh here comes tyranny god knows what he's gonna do the cops who's coming to arrest them so we actually care about all human beings yes including cops we just want them to do a better job of not shooting unarmed people but do we want them getting shot hell no we don't so protect the cops against these lunatics and if you're gonna go arrest right-wingers go with a lot of force because this is not a situation where oh I saw a guy with a tor gun in a Walmart or a twelve-year-old in a park they do have weapons be careful two easy ways to follow Young Turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and
