several months ago Donald Trump met with kim jeong-hoon in a summit meeting in order to discuss deep nuclei zhing North Korea and possibly bettering relations between the United States and and North Korea but it turns out that several months later after Trump had agreed to stop doing joint military exercises with South Korea because he can consider them provocative he has decided to continue doing those joint military exercises because North Korea hasn't actually denuclearized North Korea hasn't actually done anything which is what we predicted would happen and so as a result defense secretary Jim mattis during a press conference address this and essentially said yeah that suspension lifted take a look as you know we took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit we have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises we will work very closely as I said with the Secretary of State and what he needs done we will certainly do to reinforce his effort but at this time there is no discussion about further suspensions so I want to also correct myself because I made one small error in the intro to the story so North Korea did send back some remains of American soldiers that they had essentially kept so that's one thing that they did but they're still moving forward with their nuclear weapons development there is documentation proving that and so it was clear to me because Trump had a bargaining chip and that bargaining chip included the joint military exercises but all it took was one meeting where an individual said complementary things to Trump and he's immediately regurgitating North Korean propaganda talking points and one of those talking points was that these joint military exercises were provocative so Jake before you jump in I just want to refresh everyone's memory about the propaganda tour that Trump went on immediately after meeting with kim jeong-hoon and I want to do is we're gonna stop the war games flying to South Korea to practice and then drop bombs all over the place and then go back to Guam we are gonna get out of the the war games that cost so much money so under the circumstances that we're negotiating a very comprehensive complete deal I think it's inappropriate to be having war games and I'm doing something that I've wanted to do from the beginning we stopped playing those war games that cost us a fortune the war games are very expensive we pay for a big majority of them we fly in bombers from Guam I know a lot about airplanes it's very expensive because I think number one it's very provocative and I want to do it and I think they're very happy about it because it is so provocative and I think it's very provocative it's a very provocative situation you know I want to do stop the war games I thought they were very provocative but I also think they're very expensive it really is something that I think they very much appreciated and I think it's very provocative especially George since we're getting along oops so they then followed up and asked Jim mattis well president Trump said over and over again that the war games were very provocative and you're now doing that again so are you trying to provoke North Korea that's an excellent question because now normally no we're just doing military exercises like we've always done but the president said it was provocative so are you trying to provoke them then manas had the kind of backpedal and say well I mean we're not turning them back on they've never been turned off we're going to see how the negotiations go and then we'll calculate the future how we go forward in the future how we go forward yeah he can't answer it because the the president is an idiot and so you know what kill I don't blame mattis what's he supposed to do and the Trump put him in an untenable situation so now let's have fun in the middle of those clips you saw now I know a lot about planes they're expensive first of all who says I know a lot about planes okay I'm moving on and then follows it with their expensive as if no one knows that no one knows no but you know why he said it just remember he had Trump planes and as usual when bankrupt he's like I know casinos they're very expensive I know steaks they're very expensive because you bankrupt in every company you ever had that's why you think they're expensive you're more on so speaking of how stupid he is I don't know if you guys have heard me say that before so here are the things that he said about North Korea other than the videos that we just showed you there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea who makes a statement like that when they hadn't done one single thing to denuclearize they had all they had done was complement your stupid stupid childish ass so they went and they're like no mr. president you're a very important person he's like good there are no more nuclear weapons in North but there is at least they're trying to make them and they didn't Dino cars at all he also said it will be total denuclearization which is already starting to take place what not remotely true it was not starting to take place and of course there's not total denuclearization and they said well these negotiations what was the result correct answer is hey it was a good beginning you should talk to your enemies and that's how you get the peace in which case we'd be like hey Trump nice work good start ok we told we said that before he went right so we're on the record instead he comes on goes tremendous success so ok but like you can say hey it's a good beginning but if you say it's a tremendous success and they don't have nukes anymore then they have you they have no incentive to actually denuclearize cuz you're already in a little world that they did they can they can just keep going and then you look like an idiot yeah I mean look he bungled it in so many different ways and that's what we were talking about on the show at the time of this summit and people got on us a lot of progressives got on us because they're like oh you want war you don't want peace this is a good thing no but this is a political issue a foreign policy issue that's not black and white it is complicated and yes it's a good thing to sit down with your enemies and have a conversation a negotiation about how to move forward in order to accomplish a peaceful agreement Trump is incapable of that so when that summit took place yeah we criticized him because he was like oh here's my bargaining chip I give you I give you bargaining chip no but you know you hold on to the bargaining chip and make sure that you have verification you have a time line you have some indication some proof that they're actually gonna denuclearize and then you talk about what you're gonna give them in return including suspending the so-called war games by the way I don't really care about whether or not we do war games but if it's a bargaining chip then yes let's use that to our advantage he didn't do that he gave everything way immediately and North Korea did nothing they continued developing nuclear weapons I'll end on three goofy points okay okay number one I would love to play poker with Donald Trump oh my god mr. Trump your hair is so nice it's Chloe nice and orange fine I have a jack ten unsuited this is super random are you ready for Trump in a second I love the names of these exercises the one that's gonna have it but these are ones they like mediocre it could be better the one that's about to happen because it's back on its fall eagle anything with a bird sounds good oh yeah I don't even know what fall is and it doesn't sound great fo al okay but it's got eagle in it good enough okay you gonna be like mighty dove and I'm like yeah let's do this Yello let's go yeah the one that was canceled earlier although now mattis's having to say well nothing was canceled but it was it's back on even though it never went off Cassell was Ulchi freedom Guardian I don't know what og is at maybe it's a Korean word I don't know but it doesn't matter yeah you could take that out okay we don't speak Korean okay I know they do any freedom guardians of the galaxy maybe slightly goofy yesterday in the postgame after our gigantic long coverage of the elections Jon and I discussed what a Blue Falcon is now Blue Falcon sounds pretty cool but it's not in the postgame but not it turns out it's it's military slang for something that is very wrong okay if you want to find out what that is hey you can just google it in five seconds or you could become a Young Turks member and get that fun post game from yesterday t y-t-dot-com slash join and then the last thing is look should you talk to your enemies just to double down on an I was saying of course we've been through down times now the question is what do you get right so should you talk to Iran Dick Cheney said no Arad was ready to cooperate with us back right after the 9/11 attacks because they also hate al Qaeda and and then later actually after we invaded Iraq in a surprising move this is a rare moment where the New York a sort of movement had a chance at working Iran did get a little spooked and was like okay maybe we talked to you about you know some of the things you want and Dick Cheney's like we don't talk to evil so dumb okay on the other hand so Obama goes talk to Iran they get a good deal we actually do deep nuclear eyes Iran they just had energy programs they did have weapons programs but great fantastic let's you know take away any potential nuclear arms now if Trump had gone to Iran we would have said good I'm glad he's going to run but what if he came out of the negotiations said it's a tremendous success we gave them San Antonio but still it's wonderful you'd like I wanted you to talk to them I didn't want you to give up a US city if the situation with North Korea wasn't enough evidence to prove that Trump is a horrible negotiator just consider when he was really genuinely thinking about doing for Vladimir Putin after the Helsinki summit remember Putin wanted to do the shakedown of US officials and Trump was like uh-oh sounds like a good deal what what so if you think the Trump is not corrupt then you've got to think he's the worst negotiator ever because Putin is like hey why don't you hand over your former US ambassador for me to interrogate and a couple other people you might never see them again but in return I will let you talk to to our agents our spa who of course will give you nothing in return right and I will help you with your investigation of me oh come on any rational person with just like an IQ of 49 or higher would go wait you're gonna help my investigation of you and the way that you're gonna do that is I'm gonna give you all the documents in that investigation of you you'd laugh at the guy out of the room Trump's like that is a very good deal I'm very interested in that deal Iran will just have to be like hey Donald you want a ham sandwich okay I mean we're Muslims were against him but I'll give you a ham sandwich but throw in Seattle too so go deal be like oh you guys you'll never believe this a good a ham sandwich I did I gave up sanity San Antonio si all right let me sign the paperwork before you make me that sandwich though Oh turns out I didn't get it okay but but still still I'm thinking about getting a Nobel Peace Prize Oh disaster how's that coming along like this video that's great and you never have to miss another episode of TYT by hitting the subscribe button below and ring the bell to get notified whenever we publish a new video
