google's newest tablet the Nexus 7 is an updated version to last year's model of the same name but this year's version is better in every conceivable way this time the Nexus 7 is a bit slimmer and lighter has a narrow side bezel and a screen that's sharper than the one on Apple's iPad Mini and that's what really makes the nexus 7 stand out from a hardware perspective it's much better than the ipad mini and you're getting it off or a hundred dollars less the screen is the best part it has the sharpest resolution of any display on a 7-inch tablet and that makes all the difference when gaming reading text or watching video design-wise the nexus 7 feels slim and has a nice rubbery feel on the back but I'm not too crazy about the wide bezels at the top and bottom of the display and it makes the whole tablet feel bit out of proportion still it's easy enough to hold in one hand because it's an android tablet the Nexus 7 has one major drawback most android apps aren't designed for bigger tablet screens instead they're just blown up version of the smartphone apps the iPad on the other hand has tens of thousands of apps designed for bigger tablet screens so you're going to have a much better selection if you go with an iPad but acts aside the Nexus 7 is going to be a great tablet for a lot of people that a hundred dollars in savings more than makes up for its lack of apps plus you'll have no problem with all the basics like using email and getting all your books video music and other content from the Google Play Store for Android the nexus 7 isn't just a great budget friendly tablet it's a great tablet period for 229 dollars you're getting a lot more than Apple and other competitors can offer making it the best device in its category
