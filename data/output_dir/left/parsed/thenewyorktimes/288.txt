This story begins with a
young group of Kurds in Syria
resisting attacks
by Turkish forces.
It ends in flames.
What happens in between gives
us a rare and intimate look
at how two sides fight
on a modern battlefield.
And it shows just
how unaware one side
can be to the dangers
that are lurking above.
We’ve pieced together
frontline footage
to track the units’
movements over several days,
how they targeted
advancing forces,
and how they may
have met their end.
But first, how did these
fighters end up here?
In January, Turkey
launched an offensive
into Syria’s northwest.
It’s mostly a Kurdish area.
And Turkey regards certain
Kurds as terrorists.
The fighters’ license
plate is for Afrin,
which is a strategic
objective of Turkey.
Standing in its way is
the town of Jinderes,
a crucial junction.
This is where we located
the Kurdish fighters.
You can see that over time,
Turkish and Allied ground
forces close in on Jinderes.
They’re already overhead.
This edited drone footage
was released by Turkey.
And along with other
video, it helps
us analyze the Kurds’
defensive of Jinderes.
They’re using an M40-series
106-millimeter recoilless
rifle.
It’s a pre-Vietnam War weapon
and relatively simple to use.
It’s most accurate when
the gun’s crew can visually
identify their target.
But this crew seems to be firing
towards targets they can’t see,
elevating the barrel
to shoot over buildings
that block their view.
That kind of indiscriminate fire
can risk civilian casualties.
On Feb. 10, we located
the Kurds’ position
and determine their
direction of fire.
They’re firing towards a town
that had just been taken over
by Turkish-backed forces.
Two days later, the Kurdish
fighters moved their position,
and they shifted fire
in this direction.
Again, it corresponds
with territory
the enemy had just gained
after days of heavy fighting.
It seems the Kurds are keenly
aware of the closing threat.
The drone tracks
them to a garage
and identifies the target.
The building is hit from above.
Kurdish forces say
the gun crew was killed.
But there’s one more thing.
Remember, this drone video
was released as propaganda.
It shows a precise strike,
no collateral damage.
But that rarely happens.
Civilians have been killed
in other Turkish strikes.
And human rights organizations
say some of these
may be unlawful.
And the Kurds have fired
at civilian areas, too.
And as the Turkish offensive
moves towards more urban areas,
the fighting is likely
to get even more complex.
