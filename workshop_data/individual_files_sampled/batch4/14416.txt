kind of sort of possibly good news for us here in California about guns more on that coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if I was a day drinker or still was I would be popping bottles right now I would be popping champagne because technically technically right now with California being a part of the ninth circuit open-carry is legal with a permit although no one here except law enforcement in LA has a permit now again on technicality I possibly could and maybe in the future would be able to carry but I will not right now because this is commie California and they will find some way to bastardize and skew this judgment but at least for the moment before it gets bounced back to lower courts and then it's revisited in Circuit Court also because California likes to act like it's own country and ignore laws who knows what's going to happen here ie immigration now a little bit of background in LA County I cannot carry a pistol without a permit I can't get a permit unless I am law enforcement or show some reasonable cause of necessity and believe me I have tried every time I get a crazy stalker who somehow it gets ahold of my phone number and it starts texting me or calling me or every time I get a death threat on social media I file a police police report not because I am paranoid but because I would really like to have a paper trail and evidence every time I deemed it a necessity for me to carry a permit here in LA some day after I have had time to do my research and do a little bit of judge shopping I might try to appeal to a conservative judge that as a conservative in Los Angeles if there is anyone who deserves to be able to carry a pistol and protect herself its midget me so basically what happened is a partial panel from the Ninth Circuit three judges ruled two to one that openly carrying a firearm in public is legal the case was brought by George young in Hawaii after he was twice denied a permit to carry on the grounds of Hawaii's open carry ban so this is a rebuttal to Hawaii's earlier ruling that second Amendment protections apply only to carrying in one's home which makes absolutely no sense but anyway about the ruling Ninth Circuit Judge dr mode o Scanlon said we do not take lightly the problem of gun violence but for better or for worse the Second Amendment does protect a right to carry a firearm in public for self-defense damn right it does thank you for recognizing that okay so maybe I should clarify my excitement from earlier I might have rambled on a bit the Ninth Circuit has ruled that it is constitutional to carry in public to protect one's self in California you have to have a permit so for me to carry I still have to have a permit and it has been the policy for years that here in LA even if you carry your gun has to be unloaded I think I don't know for sure because again I've never had the luxury of knowing because I was able to carry you but again all of this is contingent upon what happens with this case in the future it will likely get bounced back down to a lower court or it will be re heard in front of the full Ninth Circuit now I will be staying on top of this because this interests me and it pertains to me here in California and again I would very much like to be able to have a concealed or open carry permit I'm not picky I'll take either one thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebels if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebels subscribe to our premium content at www.osr.wa.gov.au/payrollenquiry
