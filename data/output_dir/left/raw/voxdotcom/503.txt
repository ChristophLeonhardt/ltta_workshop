00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,460
A few months ago I took a road trip from Chicago
down to New Orleans.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,080
And on the way back up (we were somewhere
either in Tennessee or Missouri), I got pulled

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,930
over — it was my first time getting pulled over.

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,450
And it wasn’t for speeding.

5
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,970
it was because I was driving in the left lane.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,600
So there are basically two types of drivers
in the world.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,390
There are people who get really upset about
all the people driving slowly in the left

8
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,260
lane.

9
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,390
That’s Joey.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,390
He fits into that first group.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,350
And then there are a lot of drivers who had
no idea that this is even a problem.

12
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,680
Yeah, that was me.

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,480
Sorry about that.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,680
I don’t drive much.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,040
The truth is, when drivers hang out in the
left lane, it makes traffic worse and more

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,969
dangerous for everybody involved.

17
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:40,029
Here’s what that looks like.

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,120
If you have relatively slow drivers scattered
amongst the right and left lanes, faster drivers

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,089
have to repeatedly slow down and weave back
and forth, changing lanes many times to pass

20
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:51,089
all of them.

21
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:53,429
So if you're going five miles slower than
everyone else and you're traveling in the left

22
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:56,589
lane, it forces them to make dangerous moves
trying to pass you on the right

23
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,309
which is more likely to cause an accident.

24
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,760
But there’s a better way for traffic to
flow -- and that's if we only use the left lane for passing.

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,210
If all the slower drivers are in the right
lane, a faster driver can pass several at

26
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,940
once, and get back over to the right, which
cuts down the total number of lane changes

27
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,280
and eliminates the slowdowns.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,940
Move over, or get a ticket. That's the message from state troopers to people driving too slowly in the left lane.

29
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,140
Some people argue that as long as they’re
going the speed limit, they shouldn’t have

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,140
to move over.

31
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,240
But there’s evidence that that slowing down
and changing lanes is actually more dangerous

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
than speeding.

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,270
Research has shown that the strongest predictor
of an accident is variance from the average

34
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,700
speed of traffic.

35
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,270
And a car going five miles per hour slower
than the surrounding traffic has a greater

36
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,820
chance of causing an accident than one going
five miles per hour faster.

37
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,930
That’s why every state has some law on on
record that restricts the use of the left

38
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:47,930
lane.

39
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,700
In 29 states, any car that’s moving slower
than the surrounding speed of traffic should

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,760
be in the right lane.

41
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,380
And in 11 states, the laws are stricter —, they
say that the left lane is only for turning

42
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,390
or passing.

43
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:02,390
Historically police didn’t really pay that
much attention to slow left lane drivers,

44
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,940
but more recently there have been campaigns
in places like Washington, Texas, and Ohio

45
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,229
where police are actually issuing tickets
to people they spot traveling slowly in the

46
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,729
left lane.

47
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,629
"The reason why I stopped you is the law in the state of Washington is keep right except to pass."

48
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,469
"This is something that has always been illegal and against the law here in Michigan,

49
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:23,949
But now officers are rolling out this new education effort to help the public understand just what they can

50
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:26,969
and they cannot do when it comes to this type of driving.

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,920
Now, it doesn’t have to be this way.

52
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,849
A good example of this is the German Autobahn
— so this is Germany's highway network,

53
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:38,109
which has long stretches of road with no speed
limits and it has surprisingly low accident rates.

54
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:41,489
One reason for this, some researchers think,
is that German drivers are more likely to

55
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:44,680
stay in the right lane for traveling and only
use the left for passing.

56
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,049
That shared norm helps keep them safe.

57
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:50,360
So fellow drivers I am sorry — I didn’t
know the rules.

58
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,999
But I’m not alone, and if more people understand
how this works, we will have much fewer traffic

59
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:55,999
jams.

60
00:02:55,999 --> 00:00:00,000
And our roads will be a lot safer, too.
