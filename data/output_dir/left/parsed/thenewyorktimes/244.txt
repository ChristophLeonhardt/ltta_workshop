I’m Kay Cannon.
I’m the director of “Blockers."
In this scene, the
parents, played
by Leslie Mann, John
Cena, and Ike Barinholtz,
are rushing out of the house,
because Lisa and Mitchell want
to go to prom to talk
to their daughters
to stop them from having sex.
And Hunter is
trying to stop them.
"I just need to talk to my
daughter for five minutes."
"Get out of the car."
It’s a short, comedic
set piece that’s
really physical that feels like
a little bit of a comedy dance.
A little commentary here —
Ike Barinholtz was
not wearing a cup,
and he was supposed
to wear a cup.
And we had to stop the
scene in this moment
because he was hurting himself.
"Truce, truce, truce."
"I’m so sorry.
I’m so sorry."
When you’re doing
something like this,
I had a stunt team actually
do a video of what I wanted.
And then I showed the actors
what they would be doing.
We just very slowly went
through each moment.
But we did it as a whole.
So I was like, I had them
run out, get into the car,
and then we went in slow motion
through all the physicality
in the scene.
"You’re bullying me!
This is bullying!
What you’re doing is wrong!"
