and Sookie Laura when Manju Keats called
the second goal and ran to the corner
flag when I saw him heading towards me I
grabbed my second camera which was
adjusted and weighted to him but the
other player started running - they
moved closer and I had to lean back
because they were right above me more
players arrived and started piling up
and I fell down but I managed to keep
the camera aimed and get these unique
shots although I was under a pyramid of
players
