I woke up this morning for about five o'clock this morning and then started looking at the videos and when you're in the middle of a moment you don't realize just how big or special that moment is so looking back and once you come out of it you have the opportunity to just realize just how great yes they was unbelievable for me the feeling of seeing that suppor also the passion in everyone lives there again I'd say that the media have showed their complete contempt and their attitude the Metro headline this is fun the biggest red papers in Britain stellar drinking Tommy Robinson's supporters there's probably thousands of people there out of thousands of people three or four people were Matakana Stella and that's the headline they use because of the impeccable behavior and there was nothing negative to rapport they then focus on a bit of litter on the ground and man headlines about that look at the little left but on the rhombus of support the litter and the area they were focusing on was where you know against fascism all 15 of them we're demonstrating so I just thought I would catch up just today I'm feeling rough and I'm feeling rough and that the son Tommy Robinson and the male Tony wasn't straight from demonstration to die implying I was getting drunk in the House of Lords I was drinking water in the house and lots I did have a few drinks yesterday to let my hair down who wouldn't love they're not in the house lords it's not just every angle they have they try to demonize and tarnish and make it look so they can fit this marry of an image of the person that they want you to be not the person you are but the person that they want you to be the person that they want to tell the world you are and it's then the BBC reported tones and addresses his four hundred to support as out as my call everyone's got social media the British public will watch our videos and they'll know you're loyal every media outlet again with the idea of Ezra to bring independent look Joan this alongside but independent journalist to pay their travel a net and their hotels to come and report on the case I've just realized in follow those journalists so I'll put a link to them I'll put their names on here and I'm following their reporting and so find out that one of them who was sitting with the mainstream media in core and they were all conspiring together this is Associated Press the main news networks there was conspiring together on how many to say they how many people to say were our demonstration to downplay the numbers they are not there as journalist to report the truth to you the public they are lawyers and I'm glad so glad again I've called him out and since then I've just followed all their news articles if there's not conspiracy if there's not conspiracy how come my court case was not not heard yesterday because it was too complex after the judge read my evidence and my statement not one single newspaper from what I understand none have reported anything that was set in my statement the main evidence that got the case taken down and none of them have reported it's like come on oh they're funny with it's like why are you doing you're just but they don't even realize the more they do this because the public are now watching us there's eight and a half thousand people watching this life if you don't kindly share this video it will be seen by you you're expired they expose themselves if every time people know they're lying they know what they're safe today general what the flock the fellows that irrelevant I've never even heard of him some Scottish MP today stood up and make comments and accusations about myself now so people understand he has parliamentary privilege which means they can say what they won in Parliament and no one could do anything about it even if his lies so he stood up today in Parliament and he said I am a racist violent thug and that I spend my days in sight the I incite racial hatred if I incited racial hatred considering the government want a silence means stop me don't you think I'd have been arrested for inciting racial hatred he can stand up make all of these accusations with a zero evidence to cater to a sane and then no I'm quite small but this his name Berko the little chubby dwarfee looking fella who's to speak with the House of Commons is he he then backs up saying yes well I completely agree with your assessment of who that man is know nothing about me yeah I completely agree if ever there was a video of people from a different class looking down on other people it's these two morons without even realising that when they do this everyone's going to watch that video and just think you traitors or somehow a touch through so at such and you're looking down upon us and it's not just when they make these comments I think you like just as much to come up at me yeah I just seen someone's house a house or new 950,000 man house the hell so I'm sitting it's a house why bill with land oddball actually four turns husband with a mortgage you moron but anyway that's again the mainstream media building noise just building anything they can find there's some newspaper were currently harassing after my solicitors trying to they're trying to run a story now because I said ice ice at my lawyers it was the wrong word what happened was I got read him got rid of the QC not much mrs. Carson Cape in most missus and I got rid of the QC and it was the to see who was who was trying to get me to go Gilly so I'm so glad I did I'm so glad I did that so yeah it's just um it's unbelievable ready not none of them have reported none of them reported what was said in my statement none of them are reported the fact that other journalists have a broke the same reporting station none they've all just focused on anything they can use to paint anything negative when there was nothing negative yesterday there was actually a I'd say a festival or a jubilant atmosphere outside the Albani by thousands of hard-working decent British people but of course that they'd never report that they're never reporter and this case was exposed again for what is and all the journalists do I have an even breast they need to be going to finding judge Marcin and asking him if he has any regrets so this MV the MP that stood up today and made all these accusations my words to him would be simple if you're a man of your word and you would stand by your word come out of Parliament and repeat what you said about me repeat what you said where you haven't got parliamentary privilege which river would prevent me from suing your sad-ass because you made statements perming which are complete lies and you know they're lies you all know their lives but you just think and you can't even sing it's like my nose done this either meeting this morning with a barrister I was back in London first thing this morning to meet with a barrister to discuss I'm looking options now to go on the offensive for some of the things that have happened and things that have been said about me which are complete noise little guys that they can't back up for nothing come back um um but obviously he uses private Parliament's and privilege to run a headline the headline or now goes around whereas what they think is they think that by saying this and this headline that is running around now about me being and loathsome loathesome basically just slamming me by Burkhardt waivers names I think it's fraught by this this little bloke who's in the House of Commons who's had accusation off the accusation off the accusation of bullying against him who they have their own sexual problems counting on in the House of Commons and he should get his own house in order before he starts trying to slam me but again neither of these men would say what they've said outside of the house of parliament because then there'd be in a courtroom and then they'd have to stand there and look ridiculous having zero evidence to back up their claims unbelievable and you saw the reaction you all saw the reaction they've had because I sat and had a meal after I was invited by Lord Pearson we've jeroboam and others in Parliament could you imagine could you imagine if I stood for Parliament could you imagine if I was voted in could you imagine seeds inside Parliament is also I've always said I don't want to be a politician but they is not there's actually no one in that in our establishment not one person there's an elected MP that stands to speak openly and honestly about the real problems in this country there's not one there is not what our sad state look to Holland look to France look the front that's now really paid in France they have mayor's MPs all over the whole country they've all speaking openly honest look to any other as any other Parliament in Europe they all have representatives of their people of the people's the people's movements the anti-establishment freedom-loving parties across Europe or whatever happens representation we don't we have none that at some point it's going to have to change and yeah and I think that when I watch these videos I think the average person is going to watch you standing up there with your posh voice looking down upon us whilst you spout lies that most people will know allies and it's you I think that come across far worse when you make these accusations and you stand there pompously pompously slamming and slandering me well I don't have any this is my only opportunity to defend myself on social media which is why you're working tirelessly to remove me from social media I had my Twitter account removed I've had two strikes off YouTube in the last month three strikes and your YouTube account is closed down what they've kept me strikes ball without telling me exactly what it is we're booking was for a jerk I'd done an interview on German TV look at me a strike for that for hey yep if it was Haley I'd be arrested for it okay now so I currently haven't uploaded anything on from a YouTube channel because I believe the strikes last three months so they are using just like to edit and there's a video of Labour MPs grilling the CEO of YouTube asked him why humming Robinson's videos on YouTube if ever I've seen in a example of fascism it is when the government is pressurizing a private company in order to remove someone's views because the government don't like them because they break any laws but that pressure just like the pressure would've been put on the sweater off the down was born after they open up a court case in in on down won't squawk a saying that I just I had direct messages with Darin Oswald which again was a complete lie but that was enough basis to put pressure on 12 to then have me removed and they're doing down the same review and eventually it will be a face book so make the most of this while we have it and then I've appear with the YouTube strikes I'll appeal them so I don't start and only give them the excuse so I might now have to not use YouTube for the next eight weeks but yeah that's the are just fun give my views on a couple of the instances the media again and the thank-yous if you've watched I had the thing I'll thanked everyone when I was on the stage yeah this movement needs to go political it has to go political there has to be a political option for all of you people who are feeling not listen to silenced yeah I'm gonna start a new campaign tomorrow and I'm gonna give an update on I am soldier X as well but I'll wait until I've got some finalized information I'll

where around and just early next week no yeah most fine man when I was giving my speech I could even I could hardly speak I could hardly speak but again the courier was great Papa J's is one in Lua there's one in Nome King's beautiful and I just say again yeah just that every single person that turned up I know you travel from far I know you booked days off and you have to understand how how
