after several fatal terror attacks hit London last year the mayor of that say Sadiq Khan who is a demagogue tried to placate his critics by saying that overall London is the world's safest city London is the safest global city of the world and one of the safest cities in the world but we are very safer a city that was false then it's ridiculous now a wave of stabbings have given London a higher murder rate than New York City which is much bigger on Thursday six teenagers were stabbed in London and four separate incidents over just 90 minutes why is this happening why is it accelerating Katie Hopkins a lifelong resident of the UK calling us if the rebel author of lead joins us now with an explanation Katie what's going on in London it doesn't it just make you your skin cruel to hear that London Mayor still trotting out and just two days ago the same lines London is one of the safest cities and if you go amongst London right now and talk to regular people talk to regular people in Britain they wouldn't dream of taking their young people to London because we now have a higher murder rate than New York we have a major problem with black gangs in different areas of London in different postcode zip code regions black gangs rival black gangs are killing each other and that figure you mentioned six in twenty four hours or what actually went up to nine stabbings yesterday and for every stabbing carried out by one tribe one gang that will be revenge there will be vengeance for that so it's a perpetuating crime level and it's a crime wave we're going to see rising and it's a serious problem here in London that the mayor and the head of the network talked about it because it involves young black men and they're too afraid of being called racist well that's it right there I mean London has had crime problems in centuries past in various points but what's changed is the unwillingness of the people in charge to acknowledge it and their willingness instead to lie about it and punish anyone else who doesn't lie about it so when he says the lie that London is the safest global city how do people respondent London do they kind of nod in a bovine wail yeah of course it is no absolutely not in fact there's quite a campaign and it's building now to get a Sadiq Khan out and I see myself as one of the cheerleaders of that campaign of course frankly if little Sadiq Khan could take off his ballet shoes and his tutu and stop dancing around the issue and addressed the problem head-on we have a problem with black gangs in London these are a syndicated crime gangs in different areas attacking each other we need to do profiling of the attackers then we need to quadruple our stop and search efforts he got into power saying he would do his best to stop stop and search because it unfairly targeted young black men well I say tough luck if young black men are the guys mostly committing this crime then young black men can expect to be stopped and searched and frankly if it was white conservative women doing the stabbing I'd be very happy to be searched every day if it saved a life but this lot are so politically correct they are prepared to let London for let young boys die on the street slaughtered every night here because they don't want to be called racist and I think that's a thickening state of affairs here in the UK but it's a very recognisable theme for that for us over here
