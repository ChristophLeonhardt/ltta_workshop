michael cohen was not only selling access to his client donald trump but maybe doing so in a way was illegal specifically the feds could use the same law that they had against my clinton Paul Manafort because here's the report Schoen received a secret payment of $400 to fix these talks between the Khomeini and President Trump the payment arranged by intermediaries acting for Ukraine's leader Petro poroshenko now the BBC reports the part that creates this jeopardy Cohen not registered as a representative of Ukraine is required by US law a meeting took place last June and that was after the payment a source in Kiev saying they also gave Trump a gift making sure Ukraine would find no more evidence for the u.s. inquiry into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia now I'll tell you MBC News has not confirmed the BBC story Cohen denies it and Trump's newest lawyer Rudy Giuliani striking a very different note saying he assumes maybe there was a discussion of doing this while adding on that neither end was it consummated Mimi Roca also rejoins moving from the other breaking news to what was our plan story and a big one what does this mean for Michael Cohen well I think there's three different sort of buckets to this story one is the one you you mentioned already which is a fara violation or breaking of the foreign agent Registration Act law which is the same law that a Flynn has been charged with as you mentioned and that would be the Cohen acted essentially as an agent of the Ukrainian government without registering as he is required to do so any do you know what I got to ask you you're a lawyer he's a lawyer if that's all it is why didn't he register well exactly I mean look the the the reason for the law is we want to know when foreign governments are having an influence on you know US policy or or buying the president's lawyer yes exactly and clearly they didn't want anyone to know that Cohen didn't know it's this I mean do you think he knowingly took that suspicious risk for some reason I I can't say that he I mean it seems clear that he was aware that that's something he had to do I mean it would be pretty hard for him to claim that it that it isn't but but I think the second impossibly bigger piece that we just don't know the answer to yet is was there some kind of bribe going on here in other words they paid Cohen to get a meeting with Trump we know that what came out of this meeting was actually what we know so far from this report assuming it's true is it Ukraine changed its policy right they stopped investigating mana for now that also benefitted trunk because it hurts the Moller investigation because then they weren't cooperating with Muller they weren't digging for more evidence about mana for to cooperate with Muller was was that something that was requested by Trump was there and did Trump promise anything in return or Cohen what is the likelihood that there would be strong leads out of Ukraine that Bob Miller wouldn't otherwise get well actually if there are leads in the Ukraine it would be very hard to get them without the cooperation of the Ukrainian government that that you know getting leads from a foreign country even a cooperative one can be cumbersome let alone a non cooperative one so that actually is very important and ed how weird does this strike you because the flip side is if you want to be real politic about it there are people who would say that countries do all kinds of immoral unethical favors for other countries yeah Aria I'm actually less concerned with the money changing hands here I mean in some ways we've all become inured to the pay-for-play schemes that we've seen emanate from this administration I'm much more concerned with the latter element of your conversation what Mimi was talking about about the Ukrainians dropping their investigation into Paul manna Ford we've seen a pattern here and it's a pattern in which American foreign policy is accruing personal benefits to Donald Trump not for our national interest there's this example in Ukraine where the Ukrainians dropped the mana Ford investigation later in mutant Ukraine we learned from the New York Times earlier this month in fact that the Ukrainians very publicly signaled that they would stop cooperating with the Moller probe just as the United States government was deciding whether to provide them with general anti-tank missiles right which is what Mimi was was laying out I also want to get you Mimi on we learned today Jared Kushner went back to Muller spent over six hours there and we heard from his side which we don't usually hear zabi law his lawyer on that I have done this for a bunch and I'll tell you that today's witness is tomorrow's indicted person so I don't ask that question these are just the titles that are high for the media to use and so I didn't ask but I would tell you that in my experience the kinds of questions they asked the kinds of statements he made the kinds of information he has reflects that they understand that he's a witness to the events a very lawyerly way of saying he hopes his client or Kushner's a witness but he has no idea right he's certainly better at this than Giuliani the answer he gave wasn't a better answer well he's saying I'm not gonna throw a term out there because then everyone's gonna say oh well he's a witness today subject tomorrow so so you know but then again I don't know that he can read into from the questions that his client is just a witness I think that's you know he's sort of claiming to look through a crystal ball that I'm not sure you can look through you know it is interesting the cursor was called back recently I you know you would think that if someone was it can go either way because you either want to sort of give someone a chance to explain before you decide yep they're really a target or you've ruled out that there are somebody likely to be indicted and you are treating them more as a witness so it really can go either way which is why I'm saying it's it's dangerous for him or us to read into that what that means about Kushner status so my big takeaway from you tonight is a be better than Rudy I think so Mimi Roca and Ned price on a very busy evening thank you both thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on the button below for more from the last
