North Korea has claimed to have detonated its first hydrogen bomb,
in what's been called the country's largest nuclear test.
Well the international community
continues to sanction and condemn North Korea's nuclear proliferation

It's clear that the nation's future
is now more important than ever.
Will it survive, or will it fall,

The pro-dominant theory on North Korea's use of nuclear weapon

is that for now there are negotiation tools more than immediate threat to global security.

In short, many political and military analytics

In both Iraq and Libya,
disarmament has led direct to invasion by the Western forces,

In an analysis by a think-tank of instability in North Korea suggests that

in the absence of a singular leader
factions among political elites would likely form,
and lead to a deadlocked, non-functioning government,

and most importantly, food rations would stop,
and that creates a massive problem
for a population that is already closed to starvation.
Problematically,
a desperate, starving and divided population
is incredibly dangerous
for what is technically
the largest military force in the world.
Former soldiers would have nothing to rely on,
leading to high rate of criminal activities to replace government assistance.

Additionally,
North Koreans are brainwashed from a early age
to view the United States and South Korea as aggressors.

In the light of facts that these two countries along with China
would likely to be the first to respond an invade
The local populations may find back
assuming the invaders
are there to hurt and not to help
Another major issue would be dealing with
the humanitarian disaster
as 25 million North Koreans
suddenly lose what little foods stored they have.
Food Consumption Country-Wide
is estimated around 15 000 tons per day.
By comparison,
in 2017, the US offers the country
about 5% of that
to help sure the available resources.
So 15,000 tons a day
is an astronomical amount of food,
and would be incredibly difficult to deliver
while the country undergoes an insurgency
or even a civil war.
It's been predicted that if the North Korean government falls

millions would rush into China and South Korea,
neither which have the infrastructure

This could create a situation
