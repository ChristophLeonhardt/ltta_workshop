00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,880
our guest today is<font color="#CCCCCC"> John Mauldin I think</font>

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,609
despite<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday's encouraging jobs report</font>

3
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,210
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still not spectacularly optimistic</font>

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,980
about the near term for the economy but

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,720
certainly optimistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term John does</font>

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,369
the jobs report on Friday that<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

7
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">your outlook for a muddle through at all</font>

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,750
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a jobs report like this for</font>

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,840
the next three months yeah in the sense

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,550
of its more<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll I'll become more</font>

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,530
optimistic but I still think we're going

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,410
to muddle through uh in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense that</font>

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,730
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a double-dip</font>

14
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,250
recession i agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> uriel but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,360
it's because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of taxes the tax increase</font>

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,670
is just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so huge and it is</font>

17
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,020
the tax increase that's embedded

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,910
indicated in two thousand elects and

19
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">their ol law and they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give</font>

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,670
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> another four or five percent on the</font>

21
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,059
top in on that precisely on the people

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,329
who create jobs the small businesses<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

23
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,589
mean that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not their target but that's</font>

24
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,420
what happens and so you're taking money

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,640
out of the private sector and that's and

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,900
putting into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public sector which has</font>

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,970
no multiplier<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tax cuts Christina Romo</font>

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,770
I mean Obama's own person says it you

29
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,930
have a 3x multiplier on Texas forgotten

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,299
that man she's forgotten yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> old history</font>

31
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,530
and so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to have a</font>

32
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,680
negative 3x on on the tax increase so do

33
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think there's any chance Congress</font>

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,680
says you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are so</font>

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,329
perilous that we're going to postpone

36
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,549
that a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years or is a done deal that</font>

37
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,030
taxes are going up do you think pelosi

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,799
and reid are going to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we want</font>

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep the bush tax cuts really yeah i</font>

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,720
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's any chance now could</font>

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">we in some future world maybe get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

42
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that maybe but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I doubt it because</font>

43
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,159
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in pretty serious</font>

44
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,710
financial straits as a country for quite

45
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,149
some time and there's not going to be

46
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,930
this you know with the big deficits it's

47
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,579
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be difficult I think to start</font>

48
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,500
arguing that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cut taxes in</font>

49
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,570
order to decrease the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deficit and so</font>

50
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,758
what do you when does this actually hit

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,340
the economy because this is 2011 events

52
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,470
2011 only smooth sailing all through

53
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,810
tooth

54
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,730
doesn't end especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is I</font>

55
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's low growth economy one or two</font>

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,900
percent I hope it is but and and that's

57
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,580
the problem it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a slow</font>

58
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,370
growth economy and then we're going to

59
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,180
punch it with this big tax cut normally

60
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,180
the quarter after the recession ends and

61
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,739
people are saying the recession<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

62
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,470
ended you see a seven percent spike in

63
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,680
GDP well they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to revise this</font>

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,390
last quarter down to two and a half

65
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,120
percent spike when they do the next

66
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,120
revision that's not a robust recovery at

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,090
all and the jobs today doesn't change

68
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,310
that or friday doesn't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I mean</font>

69
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,910
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get to the place where um</font>

70
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,610
we start growing again I mean it's I'm

71
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:03,790
not a falling off the world gloom and

72
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,590
doom er I mean we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're finally</font>

73
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,840
finding the bottom we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find</font>

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,209
you know the new normal wear that shifts

75
00:03:10,209 --> 00:00:00,000
