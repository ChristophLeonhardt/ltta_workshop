AMERICA IN A POSITION WHERE

153
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:24,248
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADERSHIP

154
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:25,683
THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS TRULY

155
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:27,051
POSSIBLE THAT THE AMERICANS

156
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:28,219
WOULD ACTUALLY DO THIS.

157
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,587
WOULD LEAD TO THE PLACE

158
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:31,155
WHERE AMERICA WAS NO LONGER

159
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,523
HELD AT RISK BY THE NORTH

160
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:33,257
KOREAN REGIME.

161
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:35,493
THAT'S THE OBJECTIVE.

162
00:03:35,493 --> 00:03:36,761
