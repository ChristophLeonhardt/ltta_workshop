hypocrite of the day in the wake of her big Kavanagh LeBron style speech of like I'm taking my talents to Brett Kavanaugh she made that big announcement there was instantly a giant kind of GoFundMe style crowdfunding campaign that prop that came up and in in it pledged to give it raised a million dollars in a day and pledged to give that money to whoever ran against Susan Collins in 2020 when she's up for reelection she said this in response at that time she said this is a classic quid pro quo is defined in our bribery laws she told 60 minutes I think that if our politics has come to the point where people are trying to buy votes and buy positions then we are in a very sad place now we'll talk about how this unprofitable hypocrisy z itself but pretty soon after that they started there was a group called the judicial crisis network that started running this ad Washington is divided more than ever in the midst of the chaos one leader stood out Susan Collins she worked hard she put Maine and the country's best interests first senator Collins thoughtfully reviewed judge Cavanaugh judicial record and carefully weighed the evidence confident he'll be an independent judge she did the right thing support thank Susan Collins for being a reasonable voice in Washington this is part of a 6-figure a huge ad buy they spent 1.5 million dollars on the Cavanaugh thing anyway this is part of an announced huge ad buy to thank Susan Collins for what she did there that's a lot of quid pro her quo yeah I just so many great ironies here first of all I like this in her original course she's like if we have gotten to a place where people give money to politicians and expect favors in return it's a really sad place in America oh if we've gotten there if of course as I've noted before that same susan collins has taken over 21 million dollars in campaign donations from large donors and multinational corporations so my god if ever we find a politician taking money and and me vote on their behalf of course why do you think they gave her the money in the first place the second place the eighth place a time they give you money this is probably a pretty good investment on their part so that's point one point two is judicial crisis network i like their name maybe it's because they're creating judicial crises so what freakin crisis you just got like six judges in a row I know well no they I think that they're in the judicial crisis business they're like well let's create one it was nominate Cavanaugh not a credit crisis anyway I feel like with that like smooth jazz in the background like abbadabba victory lap for us dinner noon it's the judicial crisis network you can't have like that dichotomy this smooth ad for Susan Collins to moderate brought to you by the judicial rights Network anyway so there what I have million that Brett reference was an initial ad campaign they ran that was pro camera also hilarious because the woman in the ad eventually withdrew her support for Cavanaugh and said need not bang him anymore okay so that was awkward they spent a million and a half on that overall in the campaign before they started spending money afterwards it was a five million dollar campaign but Collins is shocked shocked to find out that people put money into politics she didn't know that at all not just that but also chuck Grassley in response to all the money that was gonna be given to whoever Susan Collins is by the way call to thank Susan Collins she isn't up for election until 2020 like that's an ad for her and she's not up for election for another two years and that's ridiculous to me but also chuck Grassley says I'm gonna help raise three million dollars to match that so there's more money that's a quid pro quo so that one particularly so let's break it down Susan Collins says I mean no one even bothers to ask her about her own corruption the fact that she's taking 21 million dollars over her career but if they were to ask you say no no no no now that was because you know Chevron wanted to do something for charity and Johnson & Johnson cared about my well-being and you know fill in the name of a company right JP Morgan Chase really wanted to help the people of Maine okay and that's what they gave me a lot of money and I happen to deregulate the banks but that's just a wild coincidence okay but so what she said in this case it's a quid pro quo because they're saying if you vote a certain way we're gonna raise money against you and they did they raised three and a half million dollars right now but what Chuck Grassley is saying is okay now since you voted a certain way on this issue I'm gonna give you three million dollars how is that not a quid pro quo even by susan collins logic that's exactly a quid pro quo that's exactly a bribe now the reality is of course all of those campaign donations are bribes we just made them legal in this country and who's the guy who did that oh right Justice Kennedy who Cavanaugh clerked for and so did Gorsuch and that's the last of two Supreme Court justices Kennedy retires now Cavanaugh takes his seat and he's Pro citizens united and he thinks bribery isn't bribery and corporations are human beings and money's not money it's speech but when you go protests Susan Collins and the others they say no no you should shut up about your free speech because that's a mob we don't and all day long for though all week long the Republicans would be saying it's a mob mob how dare the actual citizens speak to us you only speak to us through money but now they have the audacity to pretend that they are outraged about money in politics well it's the same exact time saying oh yeah we've got three million dollars of our own then we're gonna put in thank you for that vote I mean like one little quick sentence yeah I'll raise three million dollars for her in a heartbeat yeah that's a great point buy bread just think about that so where's that three million coming from we know where the three and a half million against her came from it came from you guys it came from average citizens no big corporations or anything like that where's the three million that Chuck grass is gonna raise like this coming from where's the five million that judicial crisis Network put in coming from their dark money groups so we're not allowed to know right so the reality is it's actually not like aggrieved conservative voters they don't ask for small dollar donations if they do it's a tiny percentage of what they take no it's from corporations wait a minute why do corporations care about sexual assault are not sexual assault or Roe vs. Wade what is it their business no it isn't about that guys Cavanaugh is massively pro corporate almost all of his decisions are in favor of big business in one particular case somebody was killed on the job in SeaWorld it's like you're have a right to your life on the job no no corporation is right again okay Gorsuch the same thing said in a different case if the employer tells you to freeze to death you should freeze to death otherwise their right to fire you okay that's these animals that are now on the court you want to talk about animals okay and where did they get the five million the three million like that to support them Oh funny enough those corporations but Susan Collins is just shocked to chagrined to find out there's money in politics next week Emma wigglin is going to be doing a money in politics video on the home of progressive series that we're doing as well that's right so everybody check that out
