12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,239
entire life<font color="#CCCCCC"> as soon as Donald was old</font>

13
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough to really compete</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he did and I</font>

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">think he was inclined</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Fred down</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Fred</font>

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,030
was very uncomfortable working<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,699
Trump Organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> he really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> struggled</font>

18
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:56,670
to fit in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually left he pursued</font>

20
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> story is also Donald's belittling</font>

21
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,860
of his brother<font color="#CCCCCC"> the joke and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fred probably took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a joke</font>

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that pilots were essentially bus</font>

24
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:12,270
drivers in the sky<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the way that</font>

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">Donald spoke to him and as a result I</font>

26
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:16,950
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the two of them were</font>

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,439
terribly close<font color="#CCCCCC"> Donald now will say that</font>

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,930
he mourns his brother who died an early

complications<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alcoholism</font>

31
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,170
the sad thing I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the lesson</font>

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Donald took from Fred's life is not</font>

33
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fred loved life and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fred was</font>

than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one will written in his lifetime</font>

40
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,829
and the last one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was completed</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">before he died essentially cut Fred's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">blood</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of becoming nicer because</font>

51

he observed his<font color="#CCCCCC"> brothers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fine qualities</font>

52
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,110
Donald became tougher<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font>

55

I hope the rest of us will<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn from</font>

our experience with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our siblings but I</font>

57
00:02:45,160 --> 00:00:00,000
think that's where Donald comes down
