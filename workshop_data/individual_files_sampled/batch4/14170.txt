Justin Trudeau and Bill Morneau have declared war on farm families proposing broad sweeping changes to punish small businesses in corporations now it's all part of Justin Trudeau's war on Canada's entrepreneurial class but it is going to hit farm families the hardest these new changes would actually make it easier for a farmer to sell his land to a large multinational corporation than it would be for that same farmer to hand down his same land to his own son or daughter the Liberals well they wouldn't bring their new corporate tax change consultations to Alberta small towns and agricultural communities so I guess I'm bringing in the consultations to you I'm hosting a series of town hall meetings first in Alberta and then Saskatchewan to save the family farm we'll have guest speakers including tax experts and I am very excited to announce that Jerry Reds the former conservative agriculture minister the man who freed us all from the wheat board will be our keynote speaker and even though the Liberals fake consultation period is all wrapped up ours is just beginning our first meeting will be Saturday October 14th 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. at Western or Park in Red Deer in salon B and the very next day that Sunday October 15th between noon and 2 will be at the Legion in Vulcan Alberta and while you're there at these two events I want to encourage everyone to record a short personal video with us about how these changes will affect you and we'll publish it we want to tell the other side of the story we want to tell your side of the story and remember I'm angry you're angry look we're all angry about these changes but we need to be on our very best behavior this like all of our events is the family-friendly one and we know how the liberal media looks for any reason to paint a group of conservatives as bigots now I need you to RSVP so that we know how many people to expect admission is free and we expect the cost of each Town Hall to be around 500 bucks if you can pitch in to help cover our costs go to save the family farm CA and the first two town halls are this weekend so I really need your help sharing this information and getting the word out now we also have a petition to the liberal agriculture minister Lawrence McAuley telling him to stop this disaster McAuley himself used to be a farmer - maybe we can jog his memory and remind him what it's like to work the land everyday with your family just so that you have something to leave to them one day please sign and share our petition now and we'll see you at one of our meetings for the rebel dot media I'm Sheila Gunn read the RSVP for our town hall meeting go to save the family farm dot CA
