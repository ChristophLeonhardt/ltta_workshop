00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,030
Hey everyone so if you follow me on

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,070
Instagram

3
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,940
then you know that I recently went to
Ireland

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,980
with my husband. This video is actually going to be a
little bit of a breakdown

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,480
of what we did for the whole trip and
also a review

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,029
of the trip itself.  Throughout the trip

7
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:23,400
we toured four different castles and
Great Value Vacations

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,990
provided the international
flight for us, they also provided the

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,830
rental car that we used

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,400
and they arranged all

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,550
the accommodations for us as well at each of the castles.

12
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,699
Each of the castles is a hotel. All that
being said I'm gonna come to go through

13
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:45,210
what we did each day
and where we went

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,379
each day and let y'all see that.
While we were on the trip

15
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,370
I did take footage and hopefully you can get
some ideas if you decide to do this

16
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,500
specific tour

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:00,270
things you can do while you're in
Ireland.

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,699
So we left on a Saturday we flew out
from San Antonio

19
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:07,729
to JFK and then from JFK we caught our

20
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,560
international flight to Air Lingus.

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,970
We ended up arriving at around

22
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,300
6 a.m. in the morning so when we arrived
on Sunday we went by

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,650
our rental car location which was

24
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:26,410
Dan Dooley Rentals and they gave us a
Nissan Micra

25
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:29,869
which is basically a compact car

26
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:34,780
and we drove that Nissan Micra for the entire week. It was automatic.

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,060
So once we got our rental car and set out

28
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,930
on our way, we took off to Cabra Castle

29
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,460
which is the first stop with the Great Value Vacations tour

30
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:48,869
Cabra Castle is located a little ways outside of

31
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,040
Kingscourt.  The castle itself sits on

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,060
a pretty huge estate. As you're driving up the

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,759
driveway to the castle. You can see just

34
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:03,950
beautiful green it's actually

35
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,420
a big golfing area all throughout it.

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,570
So that was really cool. As we pulled up the castle itself is

37
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,780
quite breathtaking as well.

38
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,500
We checked in and

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,640
got to our room, and the room was really
nice

40
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,700
I mean it was what you would expect I
think

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,099
from a mid century castle that
has been

42
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,640
converted to a hotel. So because it was
the first day

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,239
and we were incredibly jet lag -
we played it pretty cool first day.

44
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,350
We did go down and have dinner in the
restaurant

45
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:50,239
We both had Irish steak

46
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,900
which was incredibly delicious!

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,970
So after we got breakfast we took
off to

48
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,049
Newgrange! Make sure you go to the visitor center

49
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,670
first they actually shuttle bus you to
Newgrange

50
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:10,100
Newgrange is the oldest known burial
site of

51
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,690
mankind. It's older even than the pyramids by

52
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,420
I think 500 years or something...and if you're a little claustrophobic

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,640
just be aware that you do go inside
New Grange, but it is very very tight so

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,340
if you are a claustrophobic person

55
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,280
you should be aware that.

56
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,370
We woke up the day of St. Patrick's day - Tuesday

57
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,730
morning and checked out Cabra Castle. On the way out we said goodbye to

58
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,520
the Irish Wolfhounds a

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,690
little bit cause they're pretty cool.

60
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:51,850
Then set off to Donegal to head to castle #2 which is

61
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,170
Lough Eske castle - pretty sure I'm saying these names wrong...

62
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,610
Lough Eske Castle is in Donegal and

63
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,810
once again the views were breath taking

64
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,070
on the way. Lots of country side, lots of sheep

65
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,400
lots of cattle, passed a tractor or two

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,150
Lough Eske contrasted quite a bit

67
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,298
to Cabra Castle in that it was a
little more modern

68
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:23,730
Lough Eske castle also had a full spa.

69
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,290
My husband and I didn't actually do
anything in the spa because our mindset was

70
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:32,210
"we're here in this other country, so we're going to do stuff"

71
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,719
We headed to the closest town, which is Donegal

72
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:43,040
and checked out the parade

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:05:01,939
[Accordion Irish music]

74
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,719
One thing that we're really upset about
was that we only get to spend one night

75
00:05:05,719 --> 00:05:09,389
at Lough Eske castle.  It would have been
really cool to stay there a little bit

76
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:10,949
longer because

77
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,009
that room and that hotel

78
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,550
was just so nice and it's the

79
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,090
only castle that I think is actually
relatively close to a

80
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,319
decent sized city.  I think if that's something Great Value Vacations

81
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,330
would want to rethink or redo

82
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,490
is giving you an extra day

83
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,450
at Lough Eske.

84
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,300
So on the way

85
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,570
to Kilronan Castle we stopped

86
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:44,190
at the Slieve League Cliffs. One of the
excursions that you can do and

87
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,650
optionally purchase

88
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,930
through Great Value Vacations is the Cliffs of Moor.

89
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,990
We didn't. Even though we purchased it,
we didn't actually go and do it because

90
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,210
we realized it was just so out of the
way

91
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,690
from all the hotels. So we ended up
finding

92
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,800
the Slieve League cliffs and I am really happy
we did those. The Slieve League Cliffs are actually

93
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,330
free

94
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,270
right before you hit the cliffs
there's a little cafe restaurant that

95
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,900
gives you information on them

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,490
as well as gives you a little gift shop and has different snacks and beverages.

97
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,950
Those cliffs were breath taking!

98
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,110
I definitely recomment

99
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:23,490
checking out the Slieve League cliffs if

100
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,830
you are in that part of Ireland.

101
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,470
Kilronan castle was

102
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,980
for me and Mr. Hallease - our least favorite castle of the trip

103
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:44,030
I don't know, compared to Cabra Castle which is your more

104
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,230
conventional, what you would think the
castle would be

105
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,070
and then going to Lough Eske Castle which is just

106
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,810
luxury five-star feel to it.

107
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,760
Going to Kilronan Castle was just kinda like...eh..

108
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,310
That being said

109
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,290
Kilronan does offer quite a few things. They do offer a spa.

110
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,940
We did not partake, but they do have one.

111
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:13,860
They also do have fine dinning. We did eat at their restaurant.

112
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,410
The grounds are actually very pretty

113
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,970
and there was a lake right near by as well which gave a lot of picturesque views

114
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:26,220
and they also have different paths you can walk.

115
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,330
That was cool too we kinda went outside
and

116
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,750
got some fresh air and did some trekking.

117
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,680
It does seem to be very popular, there seems to be a lot of weddings that happen there

118
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,100
and I can see why

119
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,010
it would be a great location for that.

120
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,470
We kinda played it cool the next day, we really just relaxed

121
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,870
and just kinda slept in.

122
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,940
We just hung out at the castle.

123
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,620
Because at this point we've been driving every day for at least 2 - 4 hours

124
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,970
getting to different places and
seeing different things.

125
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,310
One thing about this trip that was kind of hectic is

126
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,110
it is a good amount of driving.

127
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,340
So if you live in a place where you
know

128
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,660
being in a car for 30 minutes is like

129
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,700
so long for you...

130
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,330
This particular vacation might not be up your
alley because you are driving

131
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,440
a lot.

132
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,100
We checked out of Kilronan Castle and drove straight to Dublin

133
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,090
for the day and spent the day there. We found a random parking garage

134
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,679
I think on St. John's Street and explored Dublin

135
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,350
we went by St. Patrick's Cathedral
which

136
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,040
you have to go to St. Patrick's Cathedral, and while we were there a

137
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,210
young choir was practicing which was really
cool

138
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,420
because they're voices filled the halls

139
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,320
of St. Patrick's Cathedral

140
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:37,680
[Women's choir sings]

141
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,180
The thing about Dublin is that I really would consider it a smaller New York

142
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,770
you are going to see a lot of different

143
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,780
ethnicities and types of people
represented.

144
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:52,080
We definitely fit in compared to

145
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,730
most of the rural cities that we went to which
were predominantly Caucasian.

146
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,140
Being a minority and Ireland to me

147
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:05,270
didn't feel that weird because it's not like they were looking at me

148
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,570
as if I were a threat.

149
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,840
I think in America

150
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,850
an african-american you tend to get
looked at with this

151
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,720
kinda just like confusion

152
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,420
or just like a projection of just automatic fear...

153
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,530
as an african-american.

154
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,430
In Ireland mostly people just kinda
looked at me with

155
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,560
I think just excitement.

156
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,320
...someone we don't usually see!

157
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,130
They're staring at you, but its a different kind of stare.

158
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,880
It's a different kind of stare, its more like

159
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,310
an excitement honestly.

160
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,560
Dunboyne Castle

161
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,370
is ...I wouldn't consider it a castle

162
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,580
wouldn't consider that a castle.

163
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,040
It's a really pretty building

164
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,230
The room was pretty basic nothing too
extravagant about it they have

165
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,460
really great wifi! Dunboyne - best wifi!

166
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,920
For sure! And I liked their bar area, and their bar

167
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,360
food was good. So,

168
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,280
that was the whole trip through the castles of
Ireland tour that we took with Great Value

169
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,170
Vacations.

170
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,710
All in all it was a really great
experience and I feel like

171
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,160
we definitely got our money's worth
working with Great Value Vacations to get

172
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,630
the whole trip planned was

173
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,210
pretty easy.

174
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,990
It didn't take much at all. Every hotel knew
we were coming

175
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,940
and there wasn't any taper reservations
snafu anything like that. Great Value

176
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,230
Vacations held up their end of the
deal

177
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:47,280
we ended up seeing Ireland for exponential cheaper

178
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,209
than if we had tried to do the whole
thing ourselves and

179
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:55,379
book everything ourselves. So I will
definitely be using them again

180
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:58,949
and I would recommend them. If you're the type
of person who

181
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,110
just what's a travel deal or

182
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,800
travel bargain - definitely look into Great Value Vacations

183
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,220
and the trips they offer. I know I will!

184
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,389
So I hope you enjoyed this video let me
know what you think in the comments

185
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:13,709
below!

186
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:17,759
Let me know if you have
ever been to Ireland

187
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,800
what you're trip was like

188
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,040
and if you would go back.

189
00:12:25,040 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you, when I see you!
