ASK UNANIMOUS CONSENT THAT I BE
ALLOWED TO GIVE MY REMARKS.
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: IS
THERE OBJECTION?
WITHOUT OBJECTION.
MR. RUBIO: THANK YOU,
MR. PRESIDENT.
TWO WEEKS AGO THE TRAGIC
INCIDENT IN PARKLAND, ONE OF
MANY THAT HAVE IMPACTED OUR
COUNTRY OVER THE LAST DECADE AND
BEYOND, AND BOTH THAT COMMUNITY
IN PARKLAND, THE RESIDENTS OF
THE STATE OF FLORIDA THAT I
REPRESENT, AND, FRANKLY, THE
ENTIRE NATION HAVE DEMANDED NOT
JUST ACTION, BUT IMMEDIATE
ACTION.
WE KNOW AND ANYONE WHO WATCHES
THIS PROCESS IS WELL AWARE THAT
THERE ARE DEEP DIFFERENCES ON
HOW FAR AND HOW MUCH WE SHOULD
RESTRICT THE SECOND AMENDMENT
RIGHT OF EVERY AMERICAN.
WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE DEEP
DIFFERENCES ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT
SOME OF THOSE PROPOSED
RESTRICTIONS WORK.
AND I IMAGINE THAT THOSE DEBATES
AND THOSE DIFFERENCES WILL NOT
BE EASILY RESOLVED AND WILL
CONTINUE.
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS
WIDESPREAD SUPPORT AND AGREEMENT
THAT WE MUST ACT NOW AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO PREVENT ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE
PARKLAND FROM HAPPENING ANYWHERE
ELSE EVER AGAIN.
THAT IS A CONSENSUS POSITION.
NO MATTER WHERE YOU FALL ON THIS
DEBATE, NO MATTER HOW FAR OR HOW
RESTRICTED RESTRICTIONS ON GUN
SALES IN AMERICA SHOULD BE, NO
MATTER WHAT YOUR VIEWS ARE ON
THAT, I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO
IS IN FAVOR OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS
AND I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO
IS IN FAVOR OF SEEING ANOTHER
ONE HAPPEN.
THERE IS COMMON GROUND IN THAT
REGARD.
AND WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO
OVERRED THE -- OVER THE LAST
COUPLE OF WEEKS IS TO TRY TO
DETERMINE WHAT CHANGES IN
FEDERAL LAW WOULD NOT ONLY
PREVENTED THIS ATTACK BUT
PREVENT FUTURE LAWS.
I MET WITH FEDERAL LAW
ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS
INVOLVED IN NOT THIS CASE BUT
GUN LAW IN GENERAL.
I MET WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS
FROM MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS
HIGH SCHOOL INCLUDING TWO
TEACHERS INJURED IN THE ATTACK.
I MET WITH SCHOOL BOARD
ADMINISTRATORS, THE COMMUNITY AT
LARGE INCLUDING AN APPEARANCE
LAST WEEK AT A NATIONALLY
TELEVISED TOWN HALL.
I'VE BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT
WITH SEVERAL OF THE PARENTS OF
VICTIMS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES,
AND I'VE ALSO SPOKEN TO EXPERTS
IN FIREARMS SALES.
I'VE IS SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF
FEDERALLY LICENSED FIREARMS
DEALERS THAT TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOME OF THE FRUSTRATIONS THEY
HAVE WITH OUR EXISTING LAW AND
THEIR INABILITY TO ADDRESS
PEOPLE THAT ULTIMATELY TURN OUT
TO BE INDIVIDUALS WHO SHOULD NOT
OWN ANY GUN OF ANY KIND.
AND SO BASED ON THESE MEETINGS,
BASED ON ALL OF THIS INPUT,
BASED ON ALL THE OTHER RESEARCH
THAT'S OUT THERE LEADING TO
THIS, THE FIRST THING I WANT TO
SAY, I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS
ATTACK COULD HAVE AND SHOULD
HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF CURRENT
LAW HAD BEEN FULLY ENFORCED.
THIS KILLER WAS A WELL-KNOWN
DANGER.
TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.
HE WAS A WELL-KNOWN DANGER TO
THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
HE WAS A WELL-KNOWN DANGER TO
HIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
HE WAS ALSO THE SUBJECT OF TWO
SEPARATE AND SPECIFIC WARNINGS
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, A
CALL TO THE BROWARD SHERIFF'S
OFFICE LAST NOVEMBER, A CALL TO
AN F.B.I. HOTLINE IN JANUARY.
IN
-- IN ESSENCE, WE'RE TELLING
PEOPLE, IF YOU SEEING IS, SAY
SOMETHING.
PEOPLE SAW SOMETHING AND THEY
SAID SOMETHING.
OTHER PEOPLE SAW IT OVER A
COURSE OF TIME, AND YET SOMEHOW
THIS DERANGED AND VIOLENT
INDIVIDUAL PASSED A BACKGROUND
CHECK AND PURCHASED NOT ONE, BUT
TEN SEPARATE FIREARMS AND THIS
DERANGED INDIVIDUAL WAS ABLE TO
WALK RIGHT INTO SCHOOL A FEW
MINUTES BEFORE DISMISSAL AND
TAKE THE LIVES OF 17 INNOCENT
FLORIDIANS.
THIS TRAGEDY IS THE RESULT OF A
MASSIVE, MULTISYSTEMIC FAILURE,
A FAILURE INVOLVING FEDERAL
AGENCIES, STATE AGENCIES, LOCAL
AUTHORITIES WHO ALL FAILED TO
BOTH IDENTIFY THE THREAT THAT HE
POSED AND COORDINATE A RESPONSE
TO STOP HIM BEFORE HE TOOK
ACTION.
AND IT IS THIS FAILURE WHICH I
HOPE WE WILL FOCUS ON BY
ADDRESSING THE SHORTCOMINGS AND
VULNERABILITIES IN OUR CURRENT
LAWS AND IN OUR CURRENT
POLICIES.
WE MAY STILL HAVE A DEBATE ON
THE BROADER ISSUES OF GUN SALES,
BUT IRRESPECTIVE OF THAT DEBATE,
WE STILL MUST AND SHOULD DO
THIS.
SO TODAY I WANTED TO COME HERE
AND ANNOUNCE A COMPREHENSIVE
PLAN.
NOT A SIMPLE BILL THAT YOU JUST
VOTE ON AND MOVE ON, BUT A
SERIES OF MEASURES THAT I
BELIEVE COULD PREVENT THESE
ATTACKS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN AND
ALSO HELP SCHOOLS PROTECT THEIR
STUDENTS AND THEIR TEACHERS.
I BELIEVE THESE IDEAS SHOULD
ENJOY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND, IF
PASSED, SHOULD AND COULD HELP
PREVENT THE NEXT POTENTIAL MASS
SHOOTING.
THESE ARE DETAILS I OUTLINED NOT
JUST BECAUSE THEY WORK BUT
BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN GET THE
VOTES TO PASS THEM, 60 IN THE
SENATE, AND THE MAJORITY IN THE
HOUSE AND SIGNED BY THE
PRESIDENT.
THESE ARE IDEAS THAT I THINK
WILL ENJOY THAT WIDESPREAD
SUPPORT.
ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT OUR
SCHOOLS ARE NOT PREPARED TO
PREVENT AN ATTACK.
IN MY FOLLOWUP MEETING WITH THE
TEACHERS AT THE SCHOOLS, I
LEARNED OF CHANGES TO SCHOOL
FACILITIES OR PRACTICE THAT'S
COULD HAVE STOPPED THE ATTACK OR
IMPROVED THE RESPONSE.
THEREFORE, I WILL JOIN WITH
SENATOR ORRIN HATCH AND OTHERS
TO INTRODUCE THE STOP SCHOOL
VIOLENCE ACT.
IF PASSED THIS WILL PROVIDE
FEDERAL GRANTS THAT WILL DO
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN HELPFUL, STRENGTHEN
SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE, PROVIDE
TRAINING FOR ADMINISTRATORS,
TEACHERS, AND EVEN STUDENTS TO
IDENTIFY THREATS HAND REPORT
THEM.
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL
IS SCHOOL CRISIS INTERVENTION
TEAMS.
THERE IS A SUCCESSFUL TEAM IN
LOS ANGELES THAT DOES THAT.
THAT IS A TEAM BETWEEN LAW
ENFORCEMENT, OTHER STATE
AGENCIES AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
WHERE THEY ARE TALKING TO EACH
OTHER ABOUT STUDENTS THAT MAY
POSE A THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND
INTERVENE BEFORE THEY ACT.
A SECOND ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD
IDENTIFY IS EVEN IF LAW
ENFORCEMENT, SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATORS OR FAMILIES
BELIEVES AN INDIVIDUAL COULD
HAVE AN ACT OF VIOLENCE, THEY
WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THEM FROM
PURCHASING A GUN OR TAKE AWAY
THE GUNS THEY HAVE.
THEREFORE I INTEND TO INTRODUCE
A FEW LAW, PERHAPS IN
COORDINATION WITH OTHERS, THAT
WILL LEAD TO GUN VIOLENCE
RESTRAINING ORDER, SOMETHING
THAT WILL GIVE FAMILY MEMBERS AN
OPTION TO REMOVE GUNS FROM
INDIVIDUALS WHO POSE A THREAT,
AND TO BE CLEAR, THE DUE PROCESS
IN SUCH A SITUATION WOULD BE ON
THE FRONT END, NOT ON THE BACK
END.
THE THIRD ISSUE WE UNCOVERED IS
THAT FEDERAL LAW APPEARS TO
DISCOURAGE SCHOOL SYSTEMS FROM
REPORTING DANGEROUS STUDENTS TO
LAW ENFORCEMENT.
I DON'T SUPPORT CRIMINALIZING
ALL SCHOOL CONDUCT OR SCHOOL
MISCONDUCT, BUT A STUDENT WHO
HAS THREATENED VIOLENCE, WHO HAS
EXHIBITED VIOLENT BEHAVIOR NEEDS
TO BE REPORTED TO LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
A STUDENT THAT HAS QIMENTD A
CRIME BY USE -- ISSUING A THREAT
OF DEATH.
THAT NEEDS TO BE REPORTED.
UNDER BROWARD COUNTY SCHOOL
AUTHORITIES, REPORTING A
STUDENT, A DANGEROUS ONE, TO LAW
ENFORCEMENT IS STEP SIX IN THEIR
PLAN.
THEREFORE, I INTEND TO PROPOSE
CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL YOUTH
PROMISE PROGRAM SO THAT A SCHOOL
DISTRICT PLAN UNDER THIS PROGRAM
DOES NOT DELAY AND DOES IN THE
DISCOURAGE LAW.
FROM BEING ALERTED -- LAW
ENFORCEMENT FROM BEING ALERTED
TO DANGEROUS OR VIOLENT
BEHAVIOR.
FOURTH, WE NEED TON
STRENGTHEN -- NEED TO STRENGEN
BACKGROUND CHECKS.
FIX NICS WILL INCENTIVIZE EVERY
STATE TO FULLY REPORT RELEVANT
INFORMATION TO THE NATIONAL
BACKGROUND CHECK DATABASE.
BECAUSE A BACKGROUND CHECK IS
ONLY AS GOOD AS THE INFORMATION
THAT IS ON IT.
AND THIS DERANGED KILLER WAS
ABLE TO BUY GUNS ON TEN SEPARATE
OCCASIONS BECAUSE HE WOULD HAVE
PASSED ANY BACKGROUND CHECK
BECAUSE NONE OF THIS KNOWN ABOUT
HIM WAS REPORTED TO THAT SYSTEM.
FIFTH, WE MUST BEGIN TO
PROSECUTE THE PURCHASE OF GUN BY
PEOPLE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO.
NEXT WEEK I HOPE TO BE JOINING A
BIPARTISAN GROUP LED BY SENATORS
TOOMEY AND COONS IN FILING THE
LIE AND TRY BILL.
WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE F.B.I. TO
NOTIFY STATES WHEN SOMEONE WHO
IS NOT ALLOWED TO BUY A GUN
TRIES TO BUY A GUN AND FAILS THE
BACKGROUND CHECK SO THEY CAN BE
INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED.
IN ADDITION, WE WILL PROVIDE A
NEW LAW TO GO AFTER STRAW
PURCHASES WHERE SOMEONE BUYS A
GUN ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE
BECAUSE THAT SOMEONE ELSE COULD
NOT PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK.
THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REFORMS I'M
OPEN TO, THE POSSIBILITY OF
LOOKING THE -- AT THE AGE LIMITS
OF SEMIAUTOMATIC RIFLES, THE
NOTION OF WHAT COULD BE DONE
WITH HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE AND
LOOK AT THOSE.
THESE DO NOT ENJOY THE
WIDESPREAD SUPPORT IN CONGRESS
THAT THE OTHER MEASURES I HAVE
SAID DO.
THESE IDEAS WILL HAVE TO BE
CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT CONTRIBUTE
TO GREATER PUBLIC SAFETY BUT
ALSO DO NOT UNNECESSARILY OR
UNFAIRLY INFRINGE ON THE
SECOND-AMENDMENT RIGHT OF ALL
LAW-ABIDING ADULTS TO HUNT AND
PARTICIPATE IN RECREATIONAL
SHOOTING.
BUT ULTIMATELY THERE ARE THINGS
THAT WE CAN DO THAT HAVE
WIDESPREAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
THAT WE CAN ACT ON, THAT WE CAN
GET PASSED, THAT WILL ACTUALLY
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
THESE ARE IMPACTFUL THINGS.
I JUST URGE THE SENATE AND THE
HOUSE, ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES
HERE, DO NOT HOLD HOSTAGE A
PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL
WORK AND THAT WE ALL SUPPORT
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.
THERE ARE THINGS WE CAN ACT ON
AND DO AND THERE ARE THINGS WE
CAN CONTINUE TO ARGUE OVER AND
DEBATE AND PERHAPS VOTE ON IN
THE FUTURE.
BUT THERE ARE THINGS THAT COULD
HAVE POSSIBLY PREVENTED THIS
ATTACK AND POSSIBLY FUTURE
ATTACKS, LET'S GET IT DONE.
WE OWE IT NOT JUST TO THE
FAMILIES AND VICTIMS OF
PARKLAND, BUT TO ALL FAMILIES.
FOR THIS ATTACK MAY HAVE
HAPPENED IN SOUTHERN FLOOR
BUT -- SOUTHERN FLORIDA, BUT
THESE ATTACKS COULD HAPPEN
SOMEWHERE ELSE IF WE DON'T FIX
THE LAWS AND THE WAY THAT THEY
ARE ENFORCED.
WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS
INCIDENT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS
SYSTEM AND LET US FIX IT AND WE
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO
WHILE WE CONTINUE TO DEBATE AND
WORK ON THE ISSUES THAT WE DO
NOT AGREE ON.
THAT IS WHAT I HOPE WE WILL DO.
THAT IS WHAT I HOPE AND WILL DO
EVERYTHING I CAN TO ACHIEVE.
WITH THAT, I YIELD THE FLOOR.
THE PRESIDING OFFICER: ALL TIME
HAS EXPIRED.
THE QUESTION HAS -- HAS OCCURRED
ON THE QUATTLEBAUM NOMINATION.
THERE IS A SUFFICIENT SECOND?
THERE APPEARS TO BE.
THE CLERK SHALL CALL THE ROLL.
VOTE:
