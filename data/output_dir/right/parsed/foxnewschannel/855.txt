COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP
ABOUT NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR KIM
JONG-UN SENDING THE MEDIA INTO A
TOTAL TAIL SPIN.
>> HE'S THE HEAD OF A COUNTRY.
I MEAN HE'S THE STRONG HEAD.
DON'T LET ANYONE THINK ANYTHING
DIFFERENT.
HE SPEAKS AND HIS PEOPLE SIT UP
AT ATTENTION.
I WANT MY PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID IT WITH US
A JOKE BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP THE
HEADLINES BIKE THE WASHINGTON
POST CALLING IT DICTATOR ENVY
AND POLITICO SAYING DONALD
DREAMS OF DICK CATERS.
IS THE MEDIA MAKING THIS FOR
SOMETHING NEGATIVE?
HERE TO DEBATE, ANTWUAN
SEAWRIGHT.
GOOD MORNING, ANTWUAN, LET ME
START WITH YOU.
IS THE MEDIA BLOWING THIS
COMMENT WHICH WAS INTEBDED
COMMENT WHICH WAS INTENDED FOR A
JOKE ACCORDING TO THE PRESIDENT,
ARE THEY BLOWING IT OUT OF
PROPORTION?
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE TK
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE TE
SERIOUS AND WHAT NOT TO TAKE
SERIOUS WITH THIS PRESIDENT.
WE TEND TO RESPOND TO WHAT HE
GIVES US.
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
THIS PRESIDENT HAS THE HISTORY
OF FLIRTING WITH THE IDEA OF
PROCESS OF SOME DICTATORSHIP
BEHAVIOR, FOR INSTANCE, WANTING
TO JAIL HIS POLITICAL OPPONENTS
SPEAKING TO HILLARY CLINTON.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TAKE
SERIOUS AND WHAT TO TAKE NOT.
WHAT I'VE BEEN TAUGHT IS THERE'S
ALWAYS AN ELEMENT OF SERIOUSNESS
TO EVERY JOKE.
>> MORGAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO
RESPOND TO THAT?
>> YEAH.
SO I THINK IT WAS CLEARLY A
JOKE.
AND I ACTUALLY THINK THERE'S A
STRATEGY BEHIND THE FLATTERING
WORDS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS HAD
FOR KIM JONG-UN RECENTLY.
MOST OF THIS PRESIDENCY,
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN TOUGH
ON KIM JONG-UN.
IN FACT THE SAME MEDIA NOW
CRITICIZING HIM FOR WHAT I THINK
IS A JOKE, SAID HE WAS ON THE
BRINK OF LEADING AMERICA TO THE
BRINK OF WAR.
WHAT YOU SAW FOR A FULL YEAR OF
HIS PRESIDENCY WAS VERY TOUGH
RHETT TICK ON NORTH KOREA.
NOW THAT HE'S MET WITH HIM, HE'S
TRYING TO GET TO A DEAL.
HE'S PLAYING GOOD COP IN THIS
ADMINISTRATION AND LETTING
SECRETARY POMPEO AND AMBASSADOR
BOLTON, THEY'VE HAD TOUGH WORDS
FOR NORTH KOREA.
UNTIL THEY SEE A GOOD ACT ON
NORTH KOREA TO DENUCLEARIZE.
MY ASSESSMENT IS WHAT YOU'RE
SEEING IN THE ADMINISTRATION,
THE PRESIDENT IS PLAYING GOOD
COP TRYING TO GET A DEAL DONE
AND LETTING HIS DEPUTIES TAKE ON
THE TOUGHER ROLE.
>> MORGAN, THAT IS VERY UNSTABLE
AND IT IS A DIFFERENT STYLE OF
BEHAVIOR WHEN IT COMES TO
FOREIGN POLICY.
AND EVEN THE U.N. AMBASSADOR
NIKKI HALEY SPOKE TO THE
UNSTABLE PS AND UNPREDICTABILITY
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS MAN IN
NORTH KOREA.
I THINK THAT SETS A DANGEROUS
PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE LEADERS.
THIS IS BIGGER THAN MR. TRUMP
AND FUTURE LEADERS.
>> IS THIS NOT THE PRESIDENT
PATH OF DIPLOMACY.
THIS IS HIS WHOLE PLAN.
WE SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA,
CONTROVERSIAL LEADERS, CASTRO
COMES TO MIND.
IS THIS NOT, MORGAN, I WANT YOU
TO RESPOND TO THIS.
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERL
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERR
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERE
IS THIS NOT PART OF A LOORNLGERR
PLAN?
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE HAVE USED
THE EXAMPLE OF PRESIDENT OBAMA
MEETING WITH THE LEADERS WHICH
IS A LEGITIMATE COMPARISON.
HOWEVER THE DIFFERENCE IS IN
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS, THOSE
COUNTRIES LIKE CUBA, THEY WERE
CRITICIZED AT THE TIME BECAUSE
SANCTIONS WERE RELIEVED AND
PENALTIES WERE TAKEN OFF OF THE
TABLE BEFORE YOU SAW THE OTHER
SIDE COME TO ANY SORT OF A DEAL.
THE DIFFERENCE IS IN NORTH
KOREA, SANCTIONS ARE STILL IN
PLACE, THE THREAT OF FORCE IS
THERE WU THE
THERE BU THE
THERE BUTTHE
THERE BUT TE
THERE BUT THE PRESIDENT IS
BACKING OFF SAYING I'M WILLING
TO MAKE A DEAL.
>> THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THE
HYPOCRISY WE SEE FROM THE RIGHT
OF THE IDEA OF SPEAKING TO OR
TALKING TO DICTATORS.
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER THE
RIGHT EXPLODING WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
>> QUICKLY.
>> HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE.
NORTH KOREA HAS THE CAPABILITY.
THEY HAVE SOME OF THE MOST
SOPHISTICATED CYBER WARFARE IN
THE WORLD.
THIS IS A DIFFERENT CASE THAN
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE WORLD.
THE CHICKENS FINALLY CAME HOME
TO ROOST IN NORTH KOREA.
>> IT'S FATHER'S DAY.
WE GOT TO MOVE ON.
THANK YOU.
WE DID HAVE AN EARLY MORNING
