INVESTIGATION.
FOR YEARS HE HAS BEEN SAYING
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND I'M
GOING TO PROVE IT TO YOU.
THINGS COMING OUT I WANT YOU
TO FOCUS ON THAT.
THINK ABOUT MEASURED THINK
ABOUT WHAT HE HAS DONE.
THINGS ARE STARTING TO GO
OFF RAILS A LITTLE BIT BUT
THE PRESIDENT HASN'T.
THE VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
AGGRESSIVE.
OTHERS HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE
HE HAS NOT.
SO I ASKED HIM WHAT ABOUT
THIS SUMMIT?
DO YOU STILL BELIEVE IT'S ON
TRACK?
NOW, I HAVE TO BE HONEST,
AFTERWARDS I FOUND OUT FROM
READING THE CHINESE
NEWSPAPERS WHERE NORTH KOREA
THINKS OF MIKE PENCE'S
COMMENTS DID I NOT HAVE THAT
INFORMATION GOING IN.
BUT, WATCH.
JUNE 12TH, HAVE YOU GOING TO
BE IN SINGAPORE.
>> WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT
IT TALKING ABOUT IT WE HAVE
CERTAIN CONDITIONS.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE.
AND IT WOULD BE A GREAT
THING FOR NORTH KOREA.
IF THAT HAPPENS, IT WILL BE
A GREAT THING FOR NORTH
KOREA.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT WOULD
BE A GREAT THING FOR THE
WORLD.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
BRIAN: ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE
PHASE IN OF A I DO
NUCLEARIZATION.
IF CONFIDENCE MEASURES ARE
REQUIRED?
>> WE ARE GOING TO SEE.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT DONE
IMMEDIATELY.
PHYSICALLY, A PHASE-IN MAY
BE NECESSARY.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT DONE
AT ONE TIME.
STEVE: THAT'S THE KEY POINT
RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S THE SOUND BITE.
RATHER THAN JUST NORTH KOREA
PULLING THE PLUG COMPLETELY,
THEY WOULD DO IT OVER
STAGES.
AINSLEY: THEY ARE NOT GOING
TO GIVE UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THEY SAID THAT.
STEVE: THEY WANT LEVERAGE.
TO BRIAN'S POINT, ONE OF THE
FOREIGN MINISTERS FROM NORTH
KOREA SAID REGARDING MIKE
PENCE, CALLED HIM A
POLITICAL DUMMY BECAUSE MIKE
PENCE CAME OUT AND SAID, YOU
KNOW, UNLESS NORTH KOREA
DENUKES, GOING TO WIND UP
LIKE LIBYA.
GOING TO WIND UP LIKE
QADDAFI.
THAT WAS NOT GOOD FOR
