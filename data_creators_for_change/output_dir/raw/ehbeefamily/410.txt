1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,880
I've never been so happy but without you here I feel so low

2
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:10,140
I watched you as you left but I can never seem to let you go

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,100
Cause once upon a time you were my everything

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,120
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,640
It's buried deep inside me but I feel that there is some you should know

6
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,220
I will never forget you

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,060
and you will always be by my side

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,500
from the day that I met you

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,340
I knew that I would love you till the day I die

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,440
And I will never want much more

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,900
And in my heart I will always be sure

12
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,340
I will never forget you

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,120
And you will always be by my side till the day I die

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,300
till the day I die

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,400
till the day I die

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,520
till the day I die

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,740
till the day I die

18
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,860
Funny how we both end up here but everything seems alright

19
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,940
I wonder what would happen if you went back and put up a fight

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,280
Cause once upon a time you were my everything

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,760
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,880
So what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind

23
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,880
I will never forget you

24
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,340
And you will always be by my side

25
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,140
from the day that I met you

26
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,580
I knew that I would love you till the day I die

27
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,480
And I will never want much more

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,980
And in my heart I will always be sure

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,180
I will never forget you

30
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,460
And you will always be by my side till the day I die

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,860
feeling it, loving it, everything that we do

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,940
And all along, I knew I had, something special with you

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,140
But sometimes, you gotta know, that these things fall through

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,100
But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,080
feeling it, loving it, everything that we do

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,640
And all along, I knew I had, something special with you

37
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,440
But sometimes, you gotta know, that these things fall through

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,480
I can't hide my connection with you

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,440
I will never forget you

40
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:24,160
And you will always be by my side

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,000
from the day that I met you

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,380
I knew that I would love you till the day I die

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,440
And I will never want much more

44
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,920
And in my heart I will always be sure

45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,300
I will never forget you

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,160
And you will always be by my side till the day I die

47
00:02:48,160 --> 00:00:00,000
