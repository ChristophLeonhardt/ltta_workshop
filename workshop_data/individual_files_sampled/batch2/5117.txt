and joining our discussion now Nick Ackerman a former federal prosecutor and assistants special Watergate prosecutors also an MSNBC contributor Mimi Roca a former federal prosecutor and a former assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York and a fellow at Pace University Law School now and David corn the Washington bureau chief for Mother Jones and the co-author of the new book Russian Roulette he's also an MSNBC political analyst and Nick I want to go to the first I want to go in reverse order the president's last tweet there about how strange it would be to have an obstruction of justice a case about a case under at the beginning of which there was no crime well first of all there's I don't know where he gets the idea that there was no crime there certainly are crimes that are being investigated there's the hacking into the Democratic National Committee the theft of those emails to be used to help Trump get elected there's probably a quid pro quo involved in that deal where the Russians agreed to help Trump in the campaign and the campaign agreed that with Reluctant they would drop the sanctions that were imposed for the Ukraine and by Obama secondly there's the whole conspiracy relating to the use of data Facebook and Twitter to try and suppress the Hillary Clinton vote I mean we know that Russians have already been indicted for those charges so it's just a matter of time before Muller winds up indicted the people who are on the American side of the equation so the idea that these questions were just out of the blue had nothing to do with conspiracy and the crime is not collusion it's conspiracy and that is what Muller is looking at the obstruction sure it's a separate crime and in Watergate it was charged as a separate crime because they were unable to prove the involvement of all of these various Knicks and officials in the actual break-in so they were charged and they were convicted of obstruction the underlying crime didn't come up because they committed a separate crime here there is a separate crime but it also serves to prove Trump's consciousness of guilt why would he be firing call me if he wasn't concerned that call me was going to uncover his when you go into a negotiation whether it's about legislation or litigation or anything else that you're in a serious negotiation about it seems to me if you know how to do it you know what your ammunition is and so I for example do not mention the word subpoena in this discussion unless I know I can issue a subpoena absolutely and I think Joyce was absolutely right in that statement there is no way because any prosecutor but especially Muller in this situation you don't want to make an empty threat and I use threat you know loosely because it's really more of a promise because then you look weak if you say you're gonna do something and you don't you know you look you look weak and and and you are in fact but and Mahler would have had to pre wire his subpoena Authority with Rosenstein before he said that in the discussion I think so I mean I think that's a safe assumption here given that Rosen is overseeing the investigation this is such an important step I really and what we know about Muller and how he conducts himself I don't think he would have just said this off the cuff and I don't think he would have said it without first discussing it with Rosenstein and and that brings us to Rosen Stein and David Koren I want you to listen to what rod Rosen Stein had to say today because this was extraordinary and would have been the lead tonight here if it wasn't overtaken by this Washington Post story because reveron Stein is this guy who really has been living inside his shell and we really saw him come out of his shell today when he was asked about the House of Representatives some people in the House of Representatives moving the idea of impeaching him he was at a seminar where he was discussing various public issues he was asked about that let's listen to this any reaction to the news that certain members of the house freedom caucus have talked about drafting up articles of impeachment your best efforts to comply with their document requests they can't even resist leaking their own drafts elaborate on that I saw that draft I mean I don't know who wrote it I just don't have anything to say about documents like that that nobody has the courage to put their name on and that they leaked in that way but I can tell you there were people who've been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time and I think they should understand by now the Department of Justice is not going to be extorted we're gonna do what's required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job we have a responsibility everybody in the department takes that oath we have a hundred fifteen thousand employees and if they violate it they know they're gonna be held accountable and I know those folks know that I'm not going to violate my oath david korn I think I heard applause out there in the audience watching this show right now but we have that's the most we've heard from rod Rosenstein about this investigation publicly and to see him just very easily and I think with tremendous strength back away these people who are attacking him in the House of Representatives was quite striking and suggest that you get the sense from that that he's backing Robert Mahler 100% well I assume he is at this point at some point if he doesn't he probably will have an obligation to get rid of Robin Muller but I think what we have here we've seen for the last year and a half or so Trump and his minions and I use that word in terms of that in the movie you know all kind of nibbling at the Justice Department and declaring war on the FBI and people who follow rules traditions and norms and you know I think a lot of that has come from the freedom caucus they've come up with crazy cockamamie theories conspiracy theories about the deep state and the FBI actually trying to work against Trump before the election as well as after the election and I think he must be very hard for Rosenstein and Comey when he was in office and and and director Rea now to sit back and just keep taking this again and again it's very I think undermining of the morale of people who we count on to protect us from crime and terrorists so I think this was probably a gigantic venting I think probably for the Deputy Attorney General the on a scale of one to ten this was an 11 yeah in terms of pushing back against you know the politicos me I know Nick believes that the Nixon case established the subpoena power that the prosecutors have against the president that was a subpoena for documents so now there's this 21st century question does it apply to testimony I know Nick believes it certainly does that it applied to forcing a president to submit to the to any subpoena that they would have issued then what's your view do we have it as clearly enough that the Nixon case established the president's need to comply with a testimony subpoena I think so because if you look at the language of those cases it's really about you know the president in court opinion exactly it's really about the president not being above the law and so why would you you know why would that be true for documents but not testimony so the principle you know and that's how courts decide cases they take the principle from one case and apply it to slightly different but similar facts so it seems to me it would be applicable to testimony as well and quickly before we go did did the president's did President Nixon's lawyers ever make the argument in court that hey the president is too busy no no they never did that well you couldn't do it with this president because he goes and finds his own cases in federal court that's right he becomes a litigant to himself and he's out in the golf course all the time so how can he ever claim he's too busy yeah in david korn this is the same president who volunteered to come to New York and sit down and spend as long as it took to examine the evidence in the FBI raid of Michael Cohen's home and office and hotel room to sort out what attorney-client privilege he might have there he says he's not too busy to participate in that case I think you had it right at the beginning Lawrence that line from John Dowd looked like a poor man's version of West Wing they were going to puff and and I think it's more or less probably directed at Trump himself they want Trump to say no the last thing they want is Trump appearing before Muller his lawyers David corn Nick Agron me Roca thank you all
