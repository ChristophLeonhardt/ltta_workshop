three quarters of Democrats want to nominate a fresh face for president in 2020 as public opinion polls show the party veering sharply to the left all of this is bad news of course for the reanimated corpse of former future president Hillary Clinton but it's great news for Alexandria Ocasio Cortes the wild-eyed fresh-faced socialist fraud with wind between her ears then Lisa de Pasquale will stop by to discuss these youths in her new book the social justice warrior handbook a practical Survival Guide for snowflakes Millennials and Generation Z because all of nature is but art unknown to thee an underestimated straight-shooting American president meets with a Russian dictator on this day in history finally a British baby sentenced to death in the United Kingdom is alive today because this is America this is America I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show in the spirit of communism and socialism and to Alexandria ocasion Cortez I'm not gonna do any ads today because money is bad man you know money is where I don't want to make any money money is terrible I don't want to keep the lights on it wouldn't be cool if we could all just like hang out and write poetry so no ads today that's my that's my mark for socialism because there's a really scary scary statistics going around about how Millennials have embraced socialism and apparently like issuing all education whatsoever and this is the wave of the future this is the wave of the Democratic Party future a major difference between leftists and conservatives is that leftists read Karl Marx and conservatives understand Karl Marx nowhere is this more evident than this girl Alexandria Ocasio Cortez who she went on the public affairs show on PBS firing line it's the reboot of the Bill Buckley show and this one is hosted by Margaret Hoover and she just spewed ignorance she kind of laughed about how ignorant she is it's blithe ignorance and she's a unrepentant radical socialist the numbers of that are going way way up it's really scary on this question you know left us to read Marx conservatives understand Marx here enters Alexandria Ocasio Cortes talking about unemployment I'm not the left versus the right right now the economy is going pretty strong right there's roughly 4% unemployment 3.9 percent unemployment do you think that capitalism has failed to deliver for working-class Americans or is no longer the best vehicle for working-class America well I think the numbers that you just talked about is part of the problem right because we look at these figures and we say oh unemployment is low everything is fine right well unemployment is low because everyone has two jobs unemployment is low because people are working 60 70 80 hours a week and can barely feed their kids and so I do think that right now when we have this no-holds-barred Wild West hyper capitalism what that means is profit at any cost capitalism has not always existed in the world and it will not always exist in the work where do I begin with that where this is by the way I got to tell you this lady is probably the Democrats best shot at messaging in November because right now everything is going so so well in every area of Public Policy Foreign Affairs domestic affairs but especially in the economy and that's the undeniable part right now the economy is booming we're basically that we're the strongest economy we've ever had the the Federal Reserve is seeing more growth they're observing more growth projecting more growth the International Monetary Fund is crediting Donald Trump's policies with global economic growth not just American economic growth the tax cuts people are seeing that in their paychecks unfortunately about 80% of Americans use direct deposit so they're not necessarily seeing the benefits of tax reform in every single paycheck but they are seeing it when April rolls around they're also seeing it because the corporate tax rate was slashed so we're seeing just the the economy is just roaring right now it's doing pretty well also for the first time in over a decade wages are rising wages have not been rising and there are a number of reasons for that a lot of economic reasons some reasons with regarding with regard to migration and immigration but we're seeing wages rising pretty significantly for the first time in a long time so everything's going so well and what is the Democrat answer the socialist answer is don't believe your lyin eyes good economies are bad up is down war is peace that's what they're saying how Orwellian this is the Newspeak is you're saying oh yeah low unemployment it's really really bad because that means people are working and workings is terrible I hate working do you have a look I've done a lot in my life to avoid working you know I the only book I've ever written doesn't have any words but I got to tell you working is a good thing people feel better when they're working God in the Garden of Eden doesn't just say hey Adam loaf around all day says you have to cultivate the garden before the fall he says you have to cultivate the garden you have to name the beasts you have to you know tend to this world that I've given you you have dominion over and you have to cultivate it working is good it's when people retire they just like wither away and die I'm not not all the time people can enjoy retirement but they have to be doing something if you're you know it you can look if you retire you can you know join a non-profit you can volunteer at the church you can see your family a lot and sort of spend a lot of time with them if you sit on a couch and watch TV you're not gonna last very long people are meant to work and this happened during the Obamacare debates the Democrats Nancy Pelosi said look one of the reasons that people stay in their jobs is to keep their health care but we don't want that we don't want people to feel like they have to work we want them to be able to quit their jobs and they'll have more time to write poetry and walk through the woods and you know just do it no that's bad people don't like that idle hands are the devil's playground you do have to work and it's the only answer they have but by the way the reason unemployment is low right now is not because people have two jobs that doesn't make any sense right but like the eye that just she's pulling that out of thin air because you know that people are really really overworked right now look the evidence is that wages are going up there are more jobs than people to fill them this is good this is a great time to be an American worker best time in a very long time but imagine how removed she is from the real economic circumstances of people on the ground you know leftists socialists communists like Alexandria Ocasio Cortes they're ideologue who say who cares if the economy is working in practice doesn't work in theory does it work in theory you know how removed she's trying to portray herself as this you know downtrodden hard worker from the Bronx you know who grew up in dire poverty and had no opportunities that's not true she grew up a town away from where I did in Westchester County she grew up in a more affluent town in one of the most affluent counties in the country and she had all of those opportunities her candidacy is premise taun this idea she says people like me aren't supposed to run for office what affluent people who went to expensive private colleges and got extraordinarily good public education they're not supposed to go that's who's supposed to be a politician then either people like me are really rich privileged people or not you're cute kidding me you the sort of sir even if you grew up without a lot of money in your family in in Westchester County going to those schools what like I did - we have some basically parallel stories you still are so far be I mean you were you were at the the crux of in the United States which means and if you're just born in the United States you're at the height of privilege in the world so it's this totally disingenuous thing and her answer is no money's bad that's basically her answer right that's she saying no it's bad for people to you know you don't they shouldn't work they should get everything for free but then here comes the best part of her of a range review on this program the Margaret Hoover show because it really it really highlights what what these young lefty Millennials are like here she is talking about Israel Palestine I also think that what people are starting to see at least in in the occupation of Palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian condition you use the term the occupation of Palestine I think it what I meant is like the the settlement places where or Palestinians are experiencing difficulties do you think you can expand on that I am NOT the expert geopolitics on this issue this girl has a degree from an expensive private university in international relations she says I'm not an expert on a basic question of foreign policy where she's running for Congress she's almost certainly going to win that seat for Congress but that was her degree she's got a call up bu and get a refund show apparently Yorktown High School isn't as good as we all thought it was unbelievable it and it really by the way I don't mean to just pick on her I actually kind of feel bad for this girl cuz she is so so profoundly ignorant and sort of blithely ignorant and proudly ignorant but you know this is a real problem of education because she knows the slogans Democrats know the slogans they know the talking points she's refers to the Israeli occupation of Palestine can you can you tell us more about that it's not like Margaret Hoover was trying to get her it what can you tell us more it's not a gotcha question you know Jesus could you expand on that and okay see of Cortez goes no no I can't I don't know anything next what pass we excuse me yeah I'll pass I think I'll pass on that question just moves right along this is a trouble of a millennial education because first of all there's no country called Palestine there's never in a country called Palestine as I mentioned on Fox this morning it's the country to the east of Narnia and the west of Wakanda it's not a country it's just an ideological talking point but the way that Millennials were educated and I can really speak to this I went to high school in the town over from where she went to high school at the same time were the same age I know a lady doesn't tell her age but we she and I are the same age and the way that we were educated I don't I don't blame the teachers I've had wonderful teachers the curricula all across the country and especially in New York focus on not having students learn names dates facts details what they focus on is broad themes you don't need to know the facts look you have an iphone you can always look up the facts just know the broad themes just know our ideological position and don't look too closely into those details because that might contradict the position it's a real fear it's a trouble in in education more broadly over the last few decades which is that people don't read the original texts they read Howard Zinn talking about the the framers and the founders of you know they read these left-wing ideologue and so they just get this sort of glib talking points they don't know the facts and then the moment that someone says Oh tell me more about that opinion she goes oh well I'm not an expert and by the way she finishes that clip she goes oh I'm not an expert on this but I firmly believe and this is like the most bothersome things that Millennials do they say oh I didn't read that book but here's what I think about it oh I didn't see the movie but here's what I think about it you know they're frequently wrong but never in doubt they have opinions on things that they don't know anything about and what's a the Ocasio Cortez is proudly ignorant because she doesn't have humility what a person who had any humility would say is first of all someone running for office should know should know about israel-palestine they should know about problems in the Middle East this is a sort of basic aspect of international relations and as someone who has a degree in international relations certainly should know about that but I don't really blame her for being ignorant people are ignorant all the time it's the pride of it she says you know I'd if you had humility you would say I don't know about this and so I'm gonna have to do some research and I'll get back to you when I've thought about this more she says well I don't know anything about this but I'm pretty sure that I'm right let me tell you you should believe what I think that I think even I don't know anything that is a real problem it's a crux of Millennials and it is part of the reason by the way why socialism is creeping in in such huge numbers you know she she says these things but this woman is a communist she's a member of the Democrat socialists of America she says that capitalism won't be around forever she doesn't know what capitalism is capitalism is a word that was invented in the 1820s and really popularized in later in the 19th century by by Marx and Engels and it's to refer to economic freedom I I don't even usually use the word capitalism because I think it's it's a contrivance of socialists it was invented by socialists to criticize them so I know economic a Pattaya ISM means economic freedom I use economic freedom do you think people should be able to use their money how they want to use their money buy what they want have have freedom have choice if well then you're a capitalist if you don't like that then you're anti-capitalist she's anti-capitalist people you know it's true capitalism hasn't always existed freedom of enterprise hasn't always existed that's a bad thing it just means that certain governments have abridged liberty and certain governments have allowed liberty and she says we need less Liberty I hope we have less Liberty she uses these sort of capital era communist rather talking points of late-stage capitalism you know the Democrats have always done this they in the Bush years they would say we need no war for oil you say when did we have a war for oil the Oh Bush said when did we get any oil how much oil did we get uh Oh none we didn't get any oil we should probably should have gotten some oil and we didn't get me well is they Bush lied people died is they Bush lied huh yeah what do you lie about the weapons and had it when it what was the lie first of all Saddam Hussein did have weapons of mass destruction second of all all of the intelligence communities around the world said that the weapons existed it's not a lie even even if there weren't which there were by the way but even if there weren't weapons it isn't a lie to lie you have to intentionally not tell the truth Oh Trump colluded with Russia what's your evidence that Trump colluded with Russia how that they just know the slogans and it's really sad but right now among these Millennials the Millennials broadly not just Democrats half of Millennials identify as socialists according to some new polls that is horrifying the Democratic socialists of America which had just 5,000 members less than two years ago 2016 they had 5,000 members 2018 fast forward two years that number has gone up Eightfold to 40,000 members that is a terrifying statistic it's gone up eight times in just two years that momentum isn't going to stop part of it is that Millennials don't remember communism they were born as Cortez and and I were both you know in the as the Berlin Wall was falling down and because they were uneducated they think history begins when they were born you know they don't they don't even the ones who have studied history haven't really studied history broadly they've studied people polemicists writing about history like Howard Zinn and the Democrats have moved very far to the left here we're gonna get to ELISA de Pasquale in a second because she's the expert on these millennial sjw's but just some scary statistics the the Democrats had moved far to the left according to Pew a study that came out a Pew Research last year the parties have moved apart from one another but most of that movement the vast majority of that movement is Democrats moving to the left the GOP hasn't moved that much further to the right it's the Democrats moving to the left seventy-one percent of Democrats right now believe that we should go into debt to increase welfare spending spend money that we don't have borrow money from China to just dole it out to the poor and redistribute wealth that's that's up 17 percentage points in just six years the GOP has moved just one percentage point on this issue it's dropped down just 1% Democrats have moved 17 percentage points to the left in 1994 the question was asked by pew do immigrants strengthen the country overall are they or are they aboon to the country the parties basically were in agreement Democrats said 32% yes GOP said 30% yes now the GOP has actually moved in that direction to 42% Democrats have way more than doubled it's up one and a half times on that question 84% of Democrats say yes immigrants are a spoon to the country that's a huge divergence on the question is racial discrimination the main reason the blacks can't get ahead the main reason not that does it exist at all not are there ISIL is racial discrimination the main reason that some black people can't get ahead that number when Democrats were asked that question in 2010 not that long ago 28 percent said yes now today 64 percent say yes the question basic questions a political philosophy is religion required for morality the Democrat no answer is up 13 percentage points just since 2011 this is these numbers are moving way way faster than anyone would expect that this is a bad sign and it's having some negative consequences because they're appointing these sort of witless people who haven't ever studied the things that they're talking about they don't know anything that they're talking about their radical leftists and some people are trying to pump the brakes now you know leading Democrats are realizing this here's Barack Obama just today or yesterday trying to pump the brakes on all of this but democracy demands though we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view maybe we can change their minds but maybe they'll change ours and you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start and you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you because they're white or because they're male that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling but somehow they lacked standing to speak on certain matters who's that guy does anyone can anyone recognize that guy cuz he looks like Barack Obama but he sounds like the opposite of Barack Obama this is being reported he just gave this speech if it was a speech about Nelson Mandela and it's being reported Obama issues stern rebuke to Trump no Obama issues a stern rebuke to Obama he's criticizing his own the tone that he set in the White House for the past eight years or for the eight years that he was president you know he's he's talking about the politics of fear resentment retrenchment this is the guy who said I'm gonna fundamentally transform America I'm gonna get rid of all those bitter clingers those those rubes who cling to their guns and religion he was he painted the White House rainbow colors as a rebuke to people who or the Constitution in a traditional view of marriage he said that those in power seek to undermine every institution that gives democracy meaning this is the guy undermining institutions he went up on and gave the State of the Union and he he tried he insulted the Supreme Court right to their faces when they couldn't respond to it he was he was utterly undermining the the Supreme Court he was the one who said that his surrogate said that Republican Congressmen were terrorists he said he's gonna roll over Congress because he has a pen and a phone this is the guy undermining institutions it's outrageous this is a guy politicizing the IRS to attack his political opponents politicizing it appears the FBI to attack and investigate his political opponents and this where was this Barack Obama in 2012 this guy's vice president not not just running mate sitting vice president said that the Republican nominee was trying to put black people back in Chains that's what he said he said the Trayvon Martin guy who was killed in a in a sort of cloud of mystery but whom we know was viciously beating the guy who killed him beating his head against the pavement we used we saw photos of the the injuries he said oh that he could have been my son what do you mean he could have been your son because he's black do all play Barack Obama saying all black people look alike basically it's outrageous he doesn't really wouldn't have been Barack Obama's son he doesn't doesn't look like him either you know who attacks the Cambridge police because of a local affair you know it this is the guy it's too little too late man you let you let this loose you opened up Pandora's box and now you you're reaping the Alexandria Cortes Ocasio Cortez's because of it you know the the Democratic Party is is now in the grip of these guys and this is why we've got to get to the expert you know they're in the grip of these aggrieved social justice warrior entitled lightly educated Millennials and the expert of this the author to help us understand of the of the social justice warrior Handbook is ELISA de Pasquale a practical survival guide for snowflakes Millennials and generations II Lisa thank you for being here hi there thanks for having me I'm so glad to not only be one degree away from Tom Arnold that's I'm really a the far degraded Kevin Bacon pivot point here you know just bringing us all tom has been tweeting me a lot today because of the apparent evidence that President Trump is now a Russian asset do you think it's an open-and-shut case isn't it the Trump is a Russian asset yeah I mean I you know we knew that in October 2016 right you know it's it's funny because he Tom tweeted me today said see are you finally going to apologize and admit the Trump's of Russian asset I said you know the fact that he took that soccer ball and threw it off the stage like a hot potato that's how I know that President Trump is a red-blooded American and but I am worried about the future of the country in one because I look at people like Alexandria Ocasio Cortes and also because I read your book before we begin I have to say I'm seeing some a little bit of plagiarism in here Lisa from another yeah employees I missed a whole chapter I took word-for-word from your book it's really at least you abridged it though it's only about 10 or 15 pages in there of absolutely well that's it's the one book where you cannot read it and be an expert I you know my first question because I really did enjoy the book and I encourage people to go out there and buy it and read it it's really funny what is it with these guys what is it with this generation we beat up on Millennials all the time and I want to do it some more what's their problem I think part of it is actually kind of a lack of culture I mean I'm um Generation X I know I like super young but I'm 41 and you know what lady doesn't tell her age as I always pointed out that I'm Alexandria's age too yeah I mean I don't mind saying it because I'd rather be called Gen X and fair point maybe I'm gonna be trans ageist I'm gonna be 41 here yeah you identify as a gen Xer but I think part of it is looking for some sort of culture and of their own and they do that I think by separating themselves and by creating their own rules you know for instance appropriation things like that I mean I'm appropriating Mexican culture I guess and just sort of setting up their own their own rules I mean you can go into a hot topic and you don't see their own bands you see you know 70s and 80s 60s 70s and 80s bands and there's just sort of a generation loss because as far as their knowledge like you said history begins the day they were born but as as as culture I don't think they really have it I mean they don't have the stuff that we identify so much and part of that is because there are so many niches I mean there's not you know the one TV show that they all sat down and watched as kids like like we did right which which was Nick at Nite and that's why I identify as a 75 year old at this point the I think you've you hit on it because it isn't just that they're poorly educated because and I think there is a real problem of Education for the millennial generation but people can always read books you can always try to ameliorate that the issue is the lack of culture and those are different things you know they don't a couple generations ago you could play people excerpts of classical music you could reference certain great books or novels you could reference certain movies and people would get it there was a sense of cultural idioms that I think now just don't exist why is that and is there any way to get that back yeah I mean I don't know I mean I think that's why things like Blazing Saddles were we're we're okay because people didn't separate themselves so badly that they didn't know what their black friends or Hispanic friends or or other friends would think if they were caught watching it they were already part of a big group and they didn't have to feel like they were being judged or that people didn't know who they were you know based on you know telling jokes are telling lines from from a movie and now part of it is also just that they're so willing to put so much of their lives out there you know on Twitter on Instagram or whatever the kids are using snapchat yeah use MySpace yeah yeah Facebook that it's the culture I think pushing back but you know what's interesting is you had mentioned the poll before about so ilysm but when you ask them individual issues like well do you think that you should be able to use apps like uber and an Rover and things like that I'm on individual issues they're more you know capitalist or economic they support economic freedom but in general they say they support socialism and so I don't know what the the the overlap is but on the individual issues they do support economic freedom but that's where you go back to the education in that they don't know that they don't support socialism yeah and they just think it sounds good it's just you know they have a younger voice telling them that it does the issue is the is the Blyth in the blithe ignorance you know this sort of carefreeness this cavalier ignorant the we're and I blame I guess in part the not just the education in the lack of culture but the self-esteem movement too because they've always been told they're so so special and everything they do is great and they're they can do whatever they want to do and they're gonna be wonderful and that you know I'm just on a very basic level that isn't true you know that that just isn't the case I played Little League baseball for eight years and I leaned into pitches because I like Don Baylor I mean I was a pretty good you know I was pretty good at getting on base but I couldn't hit that ball and I have eight trophies from it I have eight participation trophies and then that the the what we were always told is that when the Millennials get into the real world the real world is going to hit them like a freight train and they're gonna grow up but when you look around I don't see that happening I see people like Alexandria court Ocasio Cortes going on TV and saying oh yeah I guess I don't know that very important issue ahaha posh posh posh I'm gonna do to do I'm just gonna go right to Congress are they just gonna be able to be ouch kids forever I mean so many of them are living with their parents so many of them are not paying bills every millennial is on their parents cellphone plan I mean they're gonna they're gonna have like grandchildren before they get off their parents cellphone plan okay that's I think the workaround that they found and that's like a big topic and the social justice warrior Handbook is they'll work around of living with their parents and then now they have like a dull day camps or summer camps they have I mean the that I can't stand as adulting you know like I can't don't today they use it as a verb yeah I have to adult today because I have to pay my bills like I don't even think about it as you know behavior that's optional and there's you know to me it was never optional whether or not to have cell phone plans I mean part of it might be because when I was I get moved out of the house at 18 so things were barely a thing so I don't think they had family plans but I think they found a way and that's to prolong this adolescence as long as possible you know it used to be I mean kind of the cutoff was 26 when you started with the healthcare plan right and then now it's like 30 and then there's kind of no age on on cell phones and then they're creating all this adult type of behavior like where you can go places and have naptime you can go to a summer camp yeah the coloring books adult coloring books it's all coloring books which there's an activity and I actually call it a dream book because I think workbook is a little too demanding that's right so here's the dream book right here at section 4 yep it's pretty yeah it's a dream you don't want to you can't work you don't want to work no no that that's right that mean that's absolutely right and I I do worry that there's you know I guess it's just as with the ignorance just as with the uncultured it's the blitheness of it all they they are cavalier about their parents paying for their lifestyle their cavalier about not working they're cavalier about not having responsibility and and not knowing and it you know I mean there it even as a young man you know if right when I turned 18 you know I or 20 or whatever because everyone's on their parents cell phone plan but I said like I've got to pay I've got to pay for this or I feel weird I like it's nice to not have to pay but you but there's this kind of anxiety that comes to and you think I can't I could never live in my father's house as a 24 year old I'd feel weird about I wouldn't to do that but there are so many Millennials who who do want to do that how what is that psychology like I mean where does that come from and is there any hope to fix it I think you know I part of me doesn't just blame Millennials or our younger like I guess Gen Z part of it I think is the Boomers and that's because they've been so helpful I mean these are like the original helicopter parents right that wanted their kids to stay at home I mean it's like the smother on on the Goldbergs who doesn't want the babies to leave the nest so I think they hold some of the blame but now they're getting older they're wanting to retire and they're looking and they're like we'll wait my kids still here you know I'm ready to move to Costa Rica but I can't get the kid out of the house right I mean they've been doing ads based on those things there's an realtor ad that's but that's basically around that concept and you have to think if they're doing ads based on these concepts they're not foreign to a lot of people I mean these are real issues that that people are dealing with so to me they hold some blame and in prolonging this adolescence and I think that goes back to the culture and you have to make it less accepting with the culture that you know if you're embarrassed to tell people you know I live at home if you're embarrassed to tell a date do you want to come back to my parents place and then I think at that point it was what you're gonna start seeing the culture change yeah yeah that is a shame you've got it yeah you need because now Millennials they're so afraid of shame they say stop body shaming stop age shaming stop jawed they do all this shaming yeah you need a little shame man the shame is a good thing shame well I really enjoyed the book I encourage people to go get it the social justice warrior handbook a practical guide for snowflakes Millennials and Generation Z I also do want to quote I really like Nick Searcy's blurb on it Nick Searcy's a friend of the show he comes and hangs out with us sometimes and he said when it comes to political advice you should only listen to Hollywood actors like me but if I'm unavailable this book will do really and and you've got you've got some great endorsements here you've got an Coulter really recommends that you know seriously a number of other people and now a blank book author right then perhaps the most entitled author ever there has been also really recommends that go out there and get it where can people find you Lisa they can find the book on Amazon they can find me on Twitter at at Lisa de P and the website for the book is sjw handbook com really good Lisa thank you for being here Lisa de Pasquale we'll have to have you back and talk again yes for sure thanks okay we've got a lot more to get to today we've got to get to two segments this is America and I'll probably do a little sync do the dance and everything hey you know and then we'll also have to get to this day in history because there is just weird coincidence it's real Providence perhaps that the Trump Helsinki summit with a Russian dictator coincides with the historical anniversary of the Potsdam Conference when another straightforward American president met with a Russian dictator we'll get to that and we'll get to a great story on this day in America or the the stay in America this is America where we talk about really the the wonders of capitalism and free enterprise and freedom of movement that saved a poor little British baby before that I have to say goodbye to you I have to I have to get real capitalist now I was communist at the top of the show and I skipped the ad but now we get real capitalists give me your money keep my lights on let me start adulting and pay my own bills go to daily wired.com right now subscribe do it it's 10 bucks a month $100 for annual membership and you get a lot when you subscribe you get me you get the end were Clavin show you get the Ben Shapiro show get to ask questions in the mailbag you get no ads on the website you have to ask questions in the conversation you get I don't know like a bunch of cool stuff and most importantly you get the leftist years tumblr when Alexandria Ocasio Cortes goes on TV and talks about fictional countries and the end of capitalism and all of that and Democrats like like good electoral Democrats smart politician Democrats like you know Barack Obama or the Clintons right they they look and they say no no no no don't say that stuff no don't let them know what we really want to do now oh no now they're not gonna lose oh is that good go to daily wire.com we'll be right back with this is America and this day in history we're back so let's begin with this is America we're running late as per huge as perused when I'm adult I gotta start adulting so I can keep my schedule properly but on on this segment of this is America I got to talk about baby Oliver this is a great story only in America would this be true so you remember you've heard these stories in the UK of little Alfie Evans he was the baby that the UK authorities the National Health Service said he's got this disease there's no way that he's going to live the parents said we'll let let us take him to look for treatment elsewhere they said absolutely not we own your baby you're not allowed to do it I mean even you've got the Pope trying to intervene you've got the the Italian government offering babies like Alfie Evans or Charlie guard but citizenship so that they can come there and get get help they need and this and no you're not gonna do with this baby has to die we are gonna make this baby die and he's gonna die with dignity that's the new euphemism they use when they refuse people the Liberty to try to care for their own children and try to save their own children so this baby baby Oliver was diagnosed with cardiac fibroma which is an exceedingly rare affliction of the heart where he had this huge tumor in his heart little baby Oliver as the huge tumor and the the doctors there had never seen anything like this a lot of them didn't know what it was didn't know what it could be and all of the doctors in the UK said we can't treat it the only way that we can try to save his life is with a heart transplant but the trouble is is as in all socialistic systems there are long waiting lines and for for a baby it's virtually impossible most likely the baby would have just died waiting to get a heart transplant it would have been very very risky they said this tumor just cannot be removed sorry your kid is gonna die there's nothing you can do about it so what happens the parents say can we look elsewhere in the UK and National Health Service and it's typical way says no sorry no way no no we're not gonna pay for anything we're not gonna let you look no your kids probably gonna die and so the Boston Children's Hospital hears about this and they post and they say we can help I know that you British socialist health care system you can't help but we can help because we because of our free enterprise we have far better care more innovative care and we're and we're gonna allow you to do it we're gonna give you the freedom to try to pay for your your kid to live and so the National Health Service in the UK hears about this and what do they do they say nope we're not gonna pay for that we're not gonna pay to transport we're not gonna send any doctors nope sorry the kid has to die die with dignity he's got to die all that do you know all that dignity of death and then so dignified so the parents started a fundraiser and they raised almost all of the money that was needed to do it themselves and I think because of all the bad press the NHS has recently received they finally caved on this they said oh yes sure oh you wanted to save your kid oh yeah no we're we want you that's good we do that so what about for the last year you've been letting those other kids die and refusing to let their parents oh no that would know we love saving kids okay so they finally cave once there's enough publicity enough money raised and they even sent a couple doctors to go with the kid and the at the Boston Hospital Boston Children's Hospital they said look it's a huge tumor it's really where we don't know if we can remove the whole thing do our best what did they do because this is America they removed the whole tumor they removed the whole thing in this miraculous surgery they were sure everybody was shocked that this could happen and now that kid gets to live which is a very good thing only in America could that happen not in the United Kingdom not elsewhere in the world and why though why wish alexandria Ocasio cortez would watch my show so that you could learn these wonderful things about the the capitalist system she sewed derides it's because we have freedom and freedom you know it is true that freedom allows people to risk things you can in a in a free enterprise system you have the right to lose your own money you have the right to make trouble for yourself but you also have the right to be Tam ingenuity and to save yourself and to save your kids and the the UK they're focusing on death with dignity these are the ghouls who want to chip fundamentally change the medical profession from only caring for people in in helping people and helping to save people to killing them to assisted suicide to killing people because death is better than life it's an anti-life movement and with death and with dignity means that you don't value life in America we have a life with dignity we say you can live with dignity when you dot look we're all headed for the same place we're all gonna have our bodies turn to worm food at some point but not today you can live with dignity and there's another aspect of this which is economic and it's the scarcity mindset and the abundance mindset in socialistic countries and economies and societies they have a scarcity mindset there's a pie and it's this big and everyone's gonna get some of that pie and that's all there is the abundance mindset is baked more pie the pie can grow economies are not static societies are not static you can have innovation you can have abundance you can grow and grow and grow and you don't have that I mean Margaret Thatcher spelled it out very well he said the Socialists they just want to reduce economic inequality even if everybody is lower they want the difference to be down here rather than have some more inequality but everybody is doing much much better you know it's not the economy is not just a pie you can have abundance and you can say yes we can do it that is the outlook because socialism I I think Winston Churchill I'm gonna paraphrase this because I'm not gonna get the quote right but it's a philosophy of failure and the gospel of envy you know it's this it's just this very dour down looking scarce decrepit philosophy it's and it's a 200 year old philosophy 150 year old philosophy it's not there's nothing new about it there's nothing innovative but abundance and innovation that's always that the American spirit and it's in it we see evidence of this we see wonderful example because it saved a British babies life very good stuff before I let you all go today we got a talk also in this day in history because all of nature is but art unknown today in chance direction which thou canst not see everyone's talking about Russia and you know I've got Tom Arnold tweeting at me and saying that Trump's a traitor because he made some perhaps loose comments yesterday at a press conference that it changes practically nothing about American foreign policy and he did it accomplished a few important things too but on this day in history in 1945 President Truman met at the Potsdam Conference it was the big three he met Winston Churchill was there and also Joseph Stalin the this you know the the world with the worst dictator ever one of the worst dictators and the Soviet dictator so as strange coincidence who knows if it was planned that way it's hard for me to imagine that it wasn't planned with some sense of the calendar but they met there and Truman and Trump have some similarities you know they're both can both underestimated both considered kind of stupid they came from industries that are not traditionally political a lot of people think that they were - that they talked to straight in a too straightforward a manner you know they're too blunt and what happens at that conference by the way is that Truman mentioned to Stalin he said you know we've got this new bomb that's much more destructive than any bomb we've ever had and it's reported differently by different people but he told Stalin about the bomb that they were about to use they sort of agonized over this they said should we surprise the Soviets and just use the bomb on the Japanese and end this war and they'll learn about it when we blow it up or do we want to give them a heads up because they're our allies in this war they ultimately decided on the ladder but from everyone in attendance Churchill said this Anthony Eden said this Truman said this everyone said that Stalin didn't really react he said oh that's good you got a good bomb use it against the Japanese and the war and it was only later on that some of the Russian ministers said oh yes Stalin played it very cool in the moment but he immediately got down that night and said we've got to start building this or bomb faster we've got to catch up with them what we what we do know though is that they the event the historical ramifications of that event only became clear much later you know when you're dealing it's not like these are straightforward and negotiations and summits when you're dealing with these people you know the Soviet dictators are killers they're sharks and what we think is the obvious way to deal with them it's not always the obvious way and and the ramifications will be clear later on so everyone is freaking out over this Trump press conference with Putin what we really need to do is pump the brakes and see what happens you know because it's these things are not clear in the moment they'll become clear over time Putin said I don't trust Trump Trump doesn't trust me what will come of this will be clearer over time are we allowed to are we going to work with the Russians are we going to share some strategic interests or are we going to have just an acrimonious eight years and then another eight years at the Penn's administration and then who know it'll go on and on and on are we what are we going to have everybody take a breather it's okay these this has happened before that the United States didn't fall apart yesterday it's alright so he's going just fine there was a good NATO summit we got a lot of good progress there yeah as the New York Times admits president Trump accomplished much of what Barack Obama tried to accomplish and failed to accomplish and as the you know the Democrats were always pushing for that Russian reset the Bush administration was pushing to reset relations with Russia and get out on a good foot you know george w bush said i saw vladimir putin's soul in his eyes and probably dark and black place and in blender Putin's ole he's just like the fires of hell glowing behind them and you know President Trump goes there and he says oh yeah you know look we we're a little bit to blame to for for the the problems in the relationship between the US and Russia these are just things that people say we'll see how that relationship goes moving forward but ah take a breather you know on this point to another coincidence on this day in history in 1776 Congress learned that the the British General Howe had offered a peace deal to General Washington you know the British had landed Washington had moved his troops from Boston down to New York the British could you know ready to wipe them out but General Howe said you know we'll we'll just try to negotiate some peace and we'll let the colonies come back in and no harm no foul and he sent an emissary to Washington and Washington read the letter in the letter did not begin with the word general didn't say General Washington he wouldn't address him as general and Washington was so insulted by this he sent them packing he ripped it up he said not a chance and this is a little just a little warning to add here words do matter words really do matter in international affairs certainly and in politics you know did that break or video on it the words really really matter speech is the essential human Act and the words that use matter so I you know all in all as I say it take a breather it doesn't everything is fine in American foreign relations and and with Russia it is worth pointing out to to defend some of the critics of that press conference yesterday the words do really matter one has to be pretty careful with what they say because speech is the political act it's the human Act and so you know if I I think that press conference yesterday was just great and it was like four words from being really good you know and a few words just really left a bad taste in people's mouths one does have to be careful because words when we're negotiating when we're talking like loose people words can be used really Catholic in a Cavalier way but you've you've got to be precise about what you're saying so that there's not not a lot of confusion on that point I hope I haven't confused you on that point come back tomorrow get your mailbag questions in we're gonna do that on Thursday we've got some great guests we have like too many great guests right now so I've got to figure out we did a pre tape interview with my priest father rut ler so maybe maybe we'll try to get that to you soon because man if you think I'm right wing you got to listen to my yesterday really talk about the opposite where we've owned that Millennials are uncultured and uneducated this guy has read every single book ever and it's the most cultured man I know so we'll get that to you and some other great interviews coming up
