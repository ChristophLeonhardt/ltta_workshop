1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:00,488
THIS.

2
00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:02,223
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THAT

3
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:03,491
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT

4
00:00:03,491 --> 00:00:05,660
AND TRADE IMBALANCE WILL

5
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:06,227
END.

6
00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:07,595
HERE NOW LARRY KUDLOW,

7
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:08,596
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

8
00:00:08,596 --> 00:00:09,431
ECONOMIC COUNCIL.

9
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:10,398
LARRY, GOOD TO SEE YOU

10
00:00:10,398 --> 00:00:10,732
TONIGHT.

11
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:11,366
THANKS FOR BEING WITH US.

12
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:12,334
>> THANKS, MARTHA.

13
00:00:12,334 --> 00:00:13,335
APPRECIATE IT.

14
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:14,302
>> Martha: I GUESS, MY FIRST

15
00:00:14,302 --> 00:00:16,303
QUESTION IS ABOUT THE SORT

16
00:00:16,303 --> 00:00:17,739
OF BALANCE THAT WE HAVE SEEN

17
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,674
BETWEEN THE ONGOING TRADE

18
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:21,409
NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA, YOU

19
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,344
KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID A

20
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:23,945
WEEK OR SO AGO THAT HE WAS

21
00:00:23,945 --> 00:00:25,480
SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THE SECOND

22
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,281
MEETING THAT THE NORTH

23
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:28,183
KOREAN LEADER HAD WITH

24
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:28,683
PRESIDENT XI.

25
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:29,818
AND SHORTLY YOU THOUGHT THAT

26
00:00:29,818 --> 00:00:31,353
SORT OF MESSED THINGS UP IN

27
00:00:31,353 --> 00:00:32,153
A WAIT A MINUTE SHORTLY

28
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:34,923
AFTER THAT YOU HAD A ZTE

29
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:36,391
DEAL THAT WAS REACHED.

30
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:37,158
NOW, HAVE YOU GOT THIS

31
00:00:37,158 --> 00:00:38,560
SECOND SORT OF SLAM IN THE

32
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,361
OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH

33
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:41,262
SAYING THAT HE IS GOING TO

34
00:00:41,262 --> 00:00:43,064
HAVE 25% TARIFFS ON

35
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:44,199
50 BILLION OF CHINESE GOODS.

36
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:45,333
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION OF ALL

37
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:46,701
OF THESE THINGS, LARRY?

38
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:51,306
>> WELL, LOOK, YOU KNOW, ONE

39
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:52,674
THOUGHT RIGHT NOW, HAVE YOU

40
00:00:52,674 --> 00:00:56,044
GOT ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL

41
00:00:56,044 --> 00:00:57,112
DISCUSSIONS, NEGOTIATIONS

42
00:00:57,112 --> 00:00:59,147
AND COMMUNICATIONS.

43
00:00:59,147 --> 00:01:00,382
VIRTUALLY ALL OVER THE

44
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:00,682
GLOBE.

45
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,418
I MEAN, YOU MENTIONED NORTH

46
00:01:03,418 --> 00:01:05,553
KOREA AND SOCKET POMPEO

47
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:07,188
OPERATING THERE.

48
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:07,822
PRESUMABLY THE PRESIDENT

49
00:01:07,822 --> 00:01:08,857
WILL BE OVER THERE IN

50
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:09,891
SINGAPORE IN A WEEK OR.

51
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:12,427
SO THERE IS A G-7 MEETING

52
00:01:12,427 --> 00:01:13,962
COMING UP THERE ARE EUROPEAN

53
00:01:13,962 --> 00:01:15,363
DISCUSSIONS WITH US ABOUT

54
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:15,663
TRADE.

55
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:16,798
THERE ARE NAFTA DISCUSSIONS

56
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:18,099
WITH US ABOUT TRADE.

57
00:01:18,099 --> 00:01:19,701
THERE ARE CHINESE

58
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,101
DISCUSSIONS.

59
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:21,336
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS A CHANGE

60
00:01:21,336 --> 00:01:21,869
AGENT.

61
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:22,971
HE IS TRYING TO CHANGE A

62
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:24,472
NUMBER OF THINGS, YOU KNOW,

63
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:26,107
INCLUDING UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL

64
00:01:26,107 --> 00:01:26,641
TRADING PRACTICES.

65
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,942
HE WANTS THE U.S. TO BE

66
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:28,876
TREATED FAIRLY.

67
00:01:28,876 --> 00:01:30,545
HE WANTS RECIPROCITY.

68
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:33,748
HE WANTS PEACE AND

69
00:01:33,748 --> 00:01:34,849
DENUCLEARIZATION ON THE

70
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:35,416
KOREAN PENINSULA.

71
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,585
YOU KNOW, THESE ARE

72
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:39,153
BREAST-TAKING DEVELOPMENTS.

73
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:39,821
>> Martha: INDEED THEY ARE.

74
00:01:39,821 --> 00:01:40,722
>> I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THEY

75
00:01:40,722 --> 00:01:41,656
ARE ALL FOR THE GOOD.

76
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:42,490
I THINK THAT THE PRESIDENT

77
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,225
IS CONDUCTING HIMSELF IN A

78
00:01:44,225 --> 00:01:44,826
TERRIFIC MANNER.

79
00:01:44,826 --> 00:01:45,994
BY THE WAY, HE DOESN'T

80
00:01:45,994 --> 00:01:48,663
ALWAYS PLAY BY THE NORMS OF

81
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:49,130
WASHINGTON.

82
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,797
>> Martha: WHICH IS WHY IT

83
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:51,833
IS SO FASCINATING TO WATCH.

84
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:52,900
HE DOES LINK TRADE WITH

85
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,836
POLICY IN A WAY THAT WE

86
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:55,670
TYPICALLY HAVEN'T SEEN.

87
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,938
SO MY QUESTION WAS, YOU

88
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:59,040
KNOW, DO YOU THINK THAT THE

89
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,109
TRADE NEGOTIATION WITH CHINA

90
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:02,944
IS A BASELINE FOR WHETHER OR

91
00:02:02,944 --> 00:02:04,312
NOT CHINA IS GOING TO ALLOW

92
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:05,346
THIS NORTH KOREA TALK TO GO

93
00:02:05,346 --> 00:02:06,381
FORWARD AND YOU JUST SAID

94
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:08,316
THAT YOU THINK HE WILL BE IN

95
00:02:08,316 --> 00:02:09,951
SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12TH.

96
00:02:09,951 --> 00:02:10,717
IS THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING

97
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:11,686
THEY BELIEVE THIS THING IS

98
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:12,920
BACK ON?

99
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,355
>> NOTHING IS DEFINITE.

100
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:16,257
SO I DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD

101
00:02:16,257 --> 00:02:17,725
OF THAT CURVE.

102
00:02:17,725 --> 00:02:18,192
>> Martha: OKAY.

103
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:19,660
>> I THINK THE EXPECTATIONS

104
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,195
ARE VERY ENCOURAGING.

105
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:22,730
LOOK, CHINA TRADE DOESN'T

106
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,700
DEPEND ENCORE REA KOREA

107
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,734
DOESN'T DEPEND ON CHINA

108
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:27,101
TRADE.

109
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,469
I ACKNOWLEDGE THEY MAY BE

110
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:29,937
LINKED IN A GRAND LANDSCAPE

111
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:30,538
IF YOU WILL.

112
00:02:30,538 --> 00:02:32,240
BUT THE CHINA TRADE, LOOK,

113
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,107
THE UNITED STATES NEEDS

114
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:35,042
CHINA TO GET RID OF THESE

115
00:02:35,042 --> 00:02:37,345
UNFAIR AND ILLEGAL TRADING

116
00:02:37,345 --> 00:02:37,712
PRACTICES.

117
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:39,747
WE CAN'T LET THEM STEAL OUR

118
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:40,148
TECHNOLOGY.

119
00:02:40,148 --> 00:02:41,282
WE CAN'T LET THEM FORCE US

120
00:02:41,282 --> 00:02:42,784
TO GIVE TECHNOLOGY OVER.

121
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:46,053
THEY HAVE TO DROP TARIFF

122
00:02:46,053 --> 00:02:47,955
BARRIERS AND NONTARIFF

123
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:48,322
BARRIERS.

124
00:02:48,322 --> 00:02:51,692
SOME PROGRESS IS BEING MADE.

125
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:52,660
WILBUR ROSS IS GOING TO BE

126
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,161
OVER THERE.

127
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,562
I THINK HE IS THERE NOW

128
00:02:54,562 --> 00:02:56,230
CROSSING THE DATELINE.

129
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,299
PROGRESS MAYBE

130
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:58,332
PROGRESS HAYBE

131
00:02:58,332 --> 00:02:58,533
PROGRESS HASBE

132
00:02:58,533 --> 00:02:59,734
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.

133
00:02:59,734 --> 00:03:03,237
STEVE MNUCHIN MADE PROGRESS.

134
00:03:03,237 --> 00:03:03,938
EMPHASIZED TO THE CHINESE AS

135
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,940
WE TOLD THEM IN

136
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,574
PERSON-TO-PERSON MEETINGS,

137
00:03:06,574 --> 00:03:08,109
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT OUR

138
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:08,976
FAMILY JEWELS.

139
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:11,312
WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT

140
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:12,980
CRUCIAL, CRITICAL, STRATEGIC

141
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:13,648
TECHNOLOGIES, FOR EXAMPLE.

142
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:16,717
WE ARE GOING TO PUT IMPORTS

143
00:03:16,717 --> 00:03:18,586
ON CHINA THAT MIGHT STEAL

144
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:19,420
THOSE TECHNOLOGIES.

145
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,388
I THINK THAT'S VERY

146
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:20,755
IMPORTANT.

147
00:03:20,755 --> 00:03:21,589
WE ARE GOING TO DEMAND THAT

148
00:03:21,589 --> 00:03:23,658
THEY CHANGE A LOT OF THEIR

149
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:25,593
POLICY IN RETROSPECT TO

150
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:26,194
INVESTMENT HERE IN THE

151
00:03:26,194 --> 00:03:26,627
UNITED STATES.

152
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:27,728
THIS IS NOT NEW.

153
00:03:27,728 --> 00:03:28,996
THE CHINESE HAVE HEARD THIS

154
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:29,330
BEFORE.

155
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,831
THEIR RESPONSE, BY THE WAY,

156
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:31,799
WAS QUITE MILD BECAUSE THEY

157
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:32,867
HAVE HEARD THIS BEFORE.

158
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:36,571
BUT, AGAIN YOU, TO GET

159
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:38,306
GROWTH, TO GET MORE AMERICAN

160
00:03:38,306 --> 00:03:38,639
EXPORTS.

161
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,274
TO GET RECIPROCITY WITH

162
00:03:40,274 --> 00:03:40,608
EUROPE.

163
00:03:40,608 --> 00:03:41,809
TO GET BETTER TRADE DEALS

164
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:42,710
WITH CHINA.

165
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,178
IT WILL HELP AMERICAN JOBS.

166
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,980
IT WILL HELP AMERICA'S

167
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,782
EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES.

168
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:48,349
>> Martha: UNDERSTOOD.

169
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,850
I THINK IT IS FASCINATING TO

170
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,518
WATCH ALL THE DIFFERENT

171
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:51,586
AREAS WHERE SO MUCH WORK IS

172
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:52,186
BEING DONE.

173
00:03:52,186 --> 00:03:53,955
I GUESS, HOW FAR OUT DO YOU

174
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:54,989
THINK A TRADE DEAL WITH

175
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:55,723
CHINA IS?

176
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:57,558
CAN YOU PUT AN APPROXIMATE

177
00:03:57,558 --> 00:03:58,426
TIME FRAME ON IT, LARRY?

178
00:03:58,426 --> 00:03:59,160
>> NO.

179
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,094
I WOULDN'T EVEN TRY.

180
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,996
I MEAN, THIS IS A LONG

181
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:02,330
PROCESS.

182
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:05,499
IT'S A LONG NEGOTIATION.

183
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:06,601
PARTS OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS

184
00:04:06,601 --> 00:04:08,936
AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID

185
00:04:08,936 --> 00:04:10,438
THERE WILL BE TIME WHEN HE

186
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:11,772
EMPLOYS TARIFFS AS

187
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:12,673
ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM OR

188
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:13,741
MAYBE NEGOTIATING MECHANISM.

189
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:14,809
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN TARIFFS

190
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:15,876
WILL NOT BE USED.

191
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:17,345
THESE THINGS HAVE THEIR UPS

192
00:04:17,345 --> 00:04:18,779
AND DOWNS THERE ARE CYCLES

193
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,380
TO THIS.

194
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,382
NO, I WOULDN'T WANT TO PUT A

195
00:04:21,382 --> 00:04:21,882
DEADLINE ON THAT.

196
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:23,017
I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN

197
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:24,619
CONTINUE MAKING PROGRESS.

198
00:04:24,619 --> 00:04:25,386
>> Martha: I'M SHORT ON

199
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:25,720
TIME.

200
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,954
I WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION

201
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:27,955
TO ONE MORE THING.

202
00:04:27,955 --> 00:04:29,123
ON NORTH KOREA, THERE IS A

203
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:31,559
STORY THAT THEY PLAN TO KEEP

204
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,593
THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT

205
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:33,828
OFFERING TO KEEP BURGER

206
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:34,795
CHAINS IN NORTH KOREA.

207
00:04:34,795 --> 00:04:36,397
>> IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A

208
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,298
WINNER TO ME.

209
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:39,200
BUT I'M NOT RUNNING THE

210
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,867
STATE DEPARTMENT.

211
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,502
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT

212
00:04:41,502 --> 00:04:42,937
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

213
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,071
DENUCLEARIZATION IS A VERY

214
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:48,442
KEY PART OF THE U.S.

215
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:48,776
DEMANDS.

216
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,745
BURGER KINGS, FINE, THE MORE

217
00:04:50,745 --> 00:04:52,179
THE MERRIER, I GUESS.

218
00:04:52,179 --> 00:04:54,015
>> Martha: I COULD SAY WHY

219
00:04:54,015 --> 00:04:54,949
IF YOU ARE IN NORTH KOREA

220
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,083
YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE A

221
00:04:56,083 --> 00:04:57,451
FIVE GUYS ON THE CORNER.

222
00:04:57,451 --> 00:04:59,520
>> NORTH KOREANS NEED FOOD.

223
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,388
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

224
00:05:00,388 --> 00:05:01,422
THEY MIGHT GET SOME HELP

225
00:05:01,422 --> 00:00:00,000
FROM US IF THEY DO
