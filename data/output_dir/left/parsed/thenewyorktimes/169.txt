Hi.
I’m Ari Aster, and I
am the writer/director
of “Hereditary."
This is the opening
shot of the film.
We are opening on an image
of the treehouse, which
is a significant
monument in the film.
When we were on set
we were actually
shooting a green screen
outside of this window,
because that
treehouse is actually
a plate because we built
the entire set on a stage.
So the entire house
was built from scratch.
We’re panning away
now to reveal that we
are inside Annie’s workshop.
Annie is a character
played by Toni Collette.
And in this space she
builds miniature replicas
of spaces in her life.
And the miniatures always
sort of served as a metaphor
for the family’s
situation in this film,
which is that they are
people with no agency
and they’re revealed
to be like dolls
in a dollhouse
being manipulated
by outside forces.
So now we have landed on
the Graham house miniature.
And this is meant to
basically function
as a replica of the house
that we are in right now.
And so we needed to design
everything well in advance
of shooting so that we
could get a miniaturist,
Steve Newburn — who also
did our prosthetics —
to replicate everything
by the time we
were ready to shoot it.
So we were replicating
things before they were
built in the first place.
And here we actually had
to use tracking markers
on the miniature
room and shoot
a separate plate of
Peter’s actual room
with the wall removed.
And then we had the wonderful
VFX artists at Brainstorm.
They did a beautiful job
of seamlessly incorporating
that plate into
this shot so that it
looks as though Peter’s
actual bedroom is a miniature.
