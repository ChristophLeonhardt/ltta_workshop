1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:01,794
>> BIG SURPRISE.

2
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:03,562
WHAT THEY DON'T REPORT IS THAT

3
00:00:03,562 --> 00:00:04,830
PRESIDENT TRUMP, HE GAVE UP

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,932
NOTHING FOR THE RELEASE OF THE

5
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:09,201
THREE HOSTAGES.

6
00:00:09,201 --> 00:00:11,303
THEY'RE HOME FROM NORTH KOREA.

7
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,272
KIM JONG-UN NEEDS THE SUMMIT

8
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:15,741
MORE THAN THE U.S.

9
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:19,245
HERE WITH US, SEAN SPICER IS

10
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:21,614
WITH US AND ARI FLEISCHER,

11
00:00:21,614 --> 00:00:22,548
FORMER PRESS SECRETARY.

12
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,583
IT'S A SAD POSITION FOR

13
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:26,619
DEMOCRATS TO BE IN.

14
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,687
ALL THESE 14 RECORD STATES ON

15
00:00:28,687 --> 00:00:30,389
LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, ALL THE

16
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:31,991
DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS ON LOW

17
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:33,659
UNEMPLOYMENT RECORDS, YOU KNOW,

18
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:37,363
THE PRESIDENT, NORTH KOREA IS A

19
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:37,963
GREAT THING.

20
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:40,066
FOR THEM TO BE HAPPY, HE HAS TO

21
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:40,366
FAIL.

22
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:40,900
>> THAT'S TRUE.

23
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,368
BUT I HAVE A SURPRISING

24
00:00:42,368 --> 00:00:43,502
CONCLUSION HOW BAD IT IS WITH

25
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:44,103
THE PRESS.

26
00:00:44,103 --> 00:00:45,237
IT'S GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS.

27
00:00:45,237 --> 00:00:46,806
BECAUSE THE PRESS IS SO

28
00:00:46,806 --> 00:00:47,773
SEPARATING ITSELF FROM THE

29
00:00:47,773 --> 00:00:50,076
AMERICAN PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY IN

30
00:00:50,076 --> 00:00:52,278
THE BATTLEGROUND STATES, THE

31
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:54,847
DEMOCRATS READ THEIR GOOD

32
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,682
FAVORABLE PRESS CLIPS AND READ

33
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,084
THE TRUMP CLIPS AND THEY BELIEVE

34
00:00:58,084 --> 00:00:58,384
THEM.

35
00:00:58,384 --> 00:00:59,852
THE MORE THEY BELIEVE THE GOOD

36
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,253
PRESS THEY'RE GETTING, THE MORE

37
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:02,688
THEY SEPARATE THEMSELVES FROM

38
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:03,322
THE VOTERS.

39
00:01:03,322 --> 00:01:04,390
THE PRESS HAS SEPARATED

40
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,558
THEMSELVES FROM THE AMERICAN

41
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:06,258
PEOPLE.

42
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:08,227
SO YOU HAVE A SLICE LEFT THAT

43
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:09,228
BELIEVES THE PRESS.

44
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:10,996
>> Sean: YOU MIGHT BE THE LAST

45
00:01:10,996 --> 00:01:13,199
PRESS SECRETARY THAT EVER HAD A

46
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,634
CHANCE AT THAT JOB.

47
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,803
I WATCH SEAN SPICER WHO DID --

48
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:20,039
SEAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID

49
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,906
THAT JOB.

50
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,141
THEY CAN'T PAY NUMBER ENOUGH.

51
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,742
AND SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS IS

52
00:01:23,742 --> 00:01:24,076
AMAZING.

53
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:25,611
SHE HAS THE PATIENCE OF JOBE.

54
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:28,581
I COULD NOT DO THE JOB THAT YOU

55
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:29,415
TWO HAVE DONE.

56
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:32,685
>> THE WOUNDS ARE FINALLY

57
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:33,686
STARTING TO HEAL.

58
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:36,088
I WOULD AGREE -- CAN I JUST SAY

59
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:37,056
SOMETHING ON NORTH KOREA THOUGH?

60
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,992
THE FUNNY PART IS, ALL THE CLIPS

61
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:41,160
FORGET WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID

62
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,128
AT THE BEGINNING.

63
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:43,963
IF WE GET A DEAL, GREAT.

64
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,097
I MIGHT WALK OUT.

65
00:01:45,097 --> 00:01:47,166
HE LAID THE PREDICATE FOR THIS A

66
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:47,666
LONG TIME AGO.

67
00:01:47,666 --> 00:01:49,034
EVERYBODY IS FORGETTING HOW HE

68
00:01:49,034 --> 00:01:51,103
APPROACHED THIS TO BEGIN WITH.

69
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:52,872
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE VERY

70
00:01:52,872 --> 00:01:54,140
CLEAR HE'S WILLING TO MEET WITH

71
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,808
HIM BUT WILLING TO WALK AWAY.

72
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:57,309
THAT'S WHAT ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE

73
00:01:57,309 --> 00:01:58,110
NOR GOTTEN.

74
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,211
YOU'RE RIGHT.

75
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:00,546
HE'S GOTTEN KIM JONG-UN TO GIVE

76
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:02,481
THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES BACK,

77
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:06,385
GOTTEN TO START TALKING ABOUT

78
00:02:06,385 --> 00:02:09,020
DENUCLEARIZING THE CLEAN

79
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,388
PENINSULA.

80
00:02:09,388 --> 00:02:10,656
SO MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

81
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:11,524
ARE BENEFITTING AND THEY'RE

82
00:02:11,524 --> 00:02:13,526
DOING WHATEVER THEY CAN TO

83
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:15,261
FIGURE OUT WHAT NEGATIVE NEWS TO

84
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:15,561
COVER.

85
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,297
WHAT IS SO FASCINATING, MOST

86
00:02:18,297 --> 00:02:18,964
AMERICANS ARE SAYING THIS

87
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:19,899
PRESIDENT IS GETTING THINGS DONE

88
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,534
AND KEEPING HIS PROMISES AND

89
00:02:21,534 --> 00:02:22,768
AMERICA IS BETTER FOR IT.

90
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,603
SO I KNOW FOR A LOT OF FOLKS IN

91
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:27,106
THE PRESS CORPS, THEY'RE TRYING

92
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,809
TO FIGURE WHAT ELSE CAN I GO AT

93
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:31,510
HIM ON?

94
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,579
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THEY SHOW

95
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:34,847
HOW WILDLY OUT OF TOUCH THEY ARE

96
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:36,348
WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

97
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:38,584
THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING RESULTS

98
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:39,885
DOMESTICALLY AND FOREIGN

99
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:41,654
POLICY-WISE HE'S KEEPING THE

100
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,822
COUNTRY SAFE, DEVELOPING JOBS,

101
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:44,957
CREATING A ROBUST ECONOMY --

102
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:48,460
>> GO BACK TO NORTH KOREA FOR A

103
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,794
SECOND.

104
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,597
IF TRUMP DECIDES HE'S NOT GOING

105
00:02:51,597 --> 00:02:53,599
TO GO, THE PRESS WILL BLAME

106
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,099
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

107
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:57,036
IF KIM JONG-UN DECIDES HE'S NOT

108
00:02:57,036 --> 00:03:00,639
GOING TO GO, THE PRESS WILL

109
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,073
BLAME TRUMP.

110
00:03:01,073 --> 00:03:03,409
THEY WON'T BLAME THE DICTATOR.

111
00:03:03,409 --> 00:03:05,711
>> Sean: WHAT ABOUT NO ROCKETS

112
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:10,115
FIRED OVER JAPAN, THE DMZ?

113
00:03:10,115 --> 00:03:12,885
>> THEY COVERED THE HOSTAGES BUT

114
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:17,056
IT WAS A ONE-DAY STORY.

115
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:23,662
JILL ABRAMSON CALLS THEM THE

116
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,731
FAKE NEWS, SHE SAYS THEY HEAR

117
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:27,366
THE CASH REGISTER.

118
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:30,202
PEOPLE ARE SUBSCRIBING ONLINE IS

119
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:33,472
SO OPPOSITIONAL TO PRESIDENT

120
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:37,176
TRUMP -- IT'S THE VOICE OF THE

121
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,244
OPPOSITION.

122
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,778
NEWSPAPERS HAVE TO BE FACTUAL.

123
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:41,013
THAT'S WHAT'S GOTTEN LOST.

124
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,681
>> Sean: HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN HOW

125
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:45,084
HORRIBLE CNN -- I WANT RESIDUALS

126
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:46,585
FROM CNN AND MSNBC.

127
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,053
THEY RUN ME ALL THE TIME.

128
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:52,358
THEY NEED TO PAY ME.

129
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:53,692
ZUCKER NEEDS TO PAY ME.

130
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,862
THEY'RE NOT DOING WELL WITH

131
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,263
THIS.

132
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:59,531
IF I WAS WATCHING A PRESIDENT

133
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,568
GIVE A SPEECH AND THEY CHANTED

134
00:04:02,568 --> 00:04:06,071
FOX NEWS SUCKS, I MIGHT TAKE IT

135
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,139
SERIOUSLY AFTER A WHILE.

136
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:10,009
>> THE FUNNY THING ON MY ENDS,

137
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:11,243
DURING THE CAMPAIGN SEASON, I

138
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:11,777
WAS PUBLIC.

139
00:04:11,777 --> 00:04:13,746
I GAVE CREDIT TO CNN IN TERMS OF

140
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,347
HOW THEY COVERED THE CAMPAIGN,

141
00:04:15,347 --> 00:04:17,750
HOW THEY RAN THEIR DEBATE.

142
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,817
SUDDENLY JANUARY 11 WHEN JIM

143
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,553
ACOSTA DECIDED TO BECOME A

144
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,056
CARNIVAL BARKER, THEY DECIDED TO

145
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:27,393
CHANGE THEIR MODEL AND REALIZED

146
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:29,695
IT WAS TO FOLLOW MSNBC AND BE

147
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:31,864
THE OTHER RESISTANCE.

148
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:32,798
IT'S SAD.

149
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:35,067
THEY MADE IT PERSONAL AND THEIR

150
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:35,834
RAIDINGS ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE

151
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:36,835
OF IT.

152
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:40,172
EVERY ONE OF THESE HOSTS GOES ON

153
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,808
AIR AND TRIES TO OUTDUE EACH

154
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:43,142
OTHER.

155
00:04:43,142 --> 00:04:46,512
>> AND THE PROBLEM IS THE PRESS

156
00:04:46,512 --> 00:00:00,000
SHOULD BE THE RESISTANCE.
