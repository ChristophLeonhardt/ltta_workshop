these are television and Twitter savvy
warriors these student activists
fighting for common sense gun reports I
think Donald Trump and the nra have met
their match am i watching too much TV a
lot of these members of Congress have
fired an ar-15 and they've heard the
loud sound of that weapon but most of
them haven't been on the receiving end
of that sound like these kids have I
think it's a much larger question that's
being put to the country through the
voices of these kids what type of
country do we want to live in
