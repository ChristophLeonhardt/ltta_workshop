1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,760
When you think of the street gang MS-13, what
do you see?

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,990
Maybe, something like this.

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,450
Or this.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,369
But what if I told you the typical MS-13 gang
member in the US actually looks like one of

5
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:17,039
these young men on Facebook?

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,830
They’re around 18 years old, they like selfies,
and memes about the Joker.

7
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,750
And the young men in these photos have all
been charged with or convicted of horrific

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,750
crimes.

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,390
“The gang has committed 27 murders.”

10
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:37,140
“Taking advantage of illegal immigrants.”

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,900
MS-13 has become notorious for committing some brutal crimes.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,050
But, that’s not all we hear about them.

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,540
“MS-13 takes advantage of glaring loopholes
in our immigration laws."

14
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,800
“Violated our borders."

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,420
“Let MS-13 all over our country.”
“Not with me, we’re taking them out by

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,700
the thousands.”

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,809
The Trump Administration has made MS-13 the

18
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:08,420
most visible symbol of why the United States
needs tougher immigration policies -- especially

19
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,750
as a reason to point a finger at Central American
immigrants.

20
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:18,140
But, here’s the thing -- MS-13 was born
right here in the United States.

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:28,320
In the 1980s, a US-backed war against the
Salvadoran rebels raged in El Salvador.

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,710
Nearly a million Salvadorans escaped the violence
and fled to the US as undocumented immigrants.

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:40,660
“There to protect themselves from American
gang violence, young Salvadorans formed MS-13.”

24
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,050
This is 100 percent an American born gang.

25
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,740
It comes out of the Salvadoran immigrant community
in Los Angeles.

26
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,040
You know, a group of teenagers hanging out
smoking pot listening to rock music.

27
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,060
They called themselves the “Stoners,”
later “Mara Salvatrucha,” and eventually,

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
MS-13.

29
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,780
At the time, they were mostly juvenile delinquents
involved in street crimes, who were stuffed

30
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,500
into American jails.

31
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,819
Eventually, in the 90s and early 2000s, the
US sent large numbers of convicted immigrants

32
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,720
back to El Salvador.

33
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,860
“Today 103 dangerous individuals are off
the streets and will no longer be a threat

34
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,700
to those communities or the United States.”

35
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:25,770
But the strategy of deporting the MS-13 problem
- didn’t quite succeed.

36
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,940
“One of the most violent street gangs in

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,370
the country, the gang is known as Mara Salvatrucha.”

38
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,030
“What the FBI is now calling the most dangerous
gang in America.”

39
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,840
“Violent criminals who represent a more
immediate threat to Americans here at home

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,879
than terrorists.”

41
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,080
MS-13 members eventually set up cliques on
the East Coast of the US, concentrated in

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,540
the suburbs of Boston, DC, and Long Island.

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,560
I've been reporting on Long Island for a year
and the MS-13 that I'm seeing on the ground

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,390
there has almost nothing in common with the
MS-13 as portrayed by the government.

45
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,780
For one, the Trump administration presents
MS-13 as a drug cartel.

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,000
"They're drug smugglers."

47
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,800
But that’s not really the case.

48
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,349
MS-13 is not really involved with the international
drug trade.

49
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:22,170
The MS-13 members that I've been following
are working after school jobs.

50
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,510
They're living with their parents.

51
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,060
They get around Long Island on bicycles because
they can't afford cars.

52
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,200
It's not the kind of gang that you really
get any money from.

53
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,640
MS-13 isn’t a highly organized criminal
group -- it doesn’t have a central leader

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,870
or global ambitions.

55
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,560
But it’s been classified as a  “transnational
criminal organization.”

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,280
The Obama-era Treasury Department put the
group on a list of sanctioned organizations

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,940
with groups like the Mexican Zetas and the
Japanese Yakuza.

58
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,940
But...

59
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,440
The organization doesn’t have that kind
of sophistication to really play with the

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
major players.

61
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,190
Yet MS-13 alarmism has persisted -- for decades.

62
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,380
“MS-13 has the potential to be far more
dangerous than gangs like the Bloods and Crips.”

63
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,680
“One of the fastest growing gangs in our
nation.”

64
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,150
“It’s a fact MS-13 is the fastest growing
gang in the United States.”

65
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,699
Even though MS-13 has stuck around, it’s
not actually growing.

66
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:24,169
The estimates of MS-13 size in the U.S. have
kind of ping ponged between 5,000 and 10,000

67
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:26,460
for the last 10 to 15 years.

68
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:32,379
There's no indication that we're seeing a
bigger surge of MS-13 than we'd seen in the

69
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,379
past.

70
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:38,949
But even based on the government’s rough
estimates, MS-13 accounts for a tiny fraction

71
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:44,729
of street gang members in the US, which are
said to be about 1.4 million.

72
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:50,319
Of that, the Crips, based primarily in Southern
California, have an estimated 35,000 members.

73
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,439
Lesser known groups, like Chicago’s Gangster
Disciples, have about 50,000 members.

74
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,199
But MS-13 is likely the gang we hear about
the most.

75
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,969
Now, with Central American immigrants seeking
asylum at the US Border, the Trump administration

76
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:10,330
has raised a new concern about MS-13 posing
as fake families.

77
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,580
“The kids are being used by pawns. Those
are traffickers, those are smugglers, that

78
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,110
is MS-13. Those are criminals, those are abusers.”

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:25,741
In reality, out of over 30,000 families apprehended
at the border this fiscal year, only 200 were

80
00:05:25,741 --> 00:05:30,909
fake families and there’s no evidence to
tie any of them to MS-13.

81
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:35,659
The administration has said that it is carrying
out aggressive immigration raids to pick up

82
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,659
MS-13 members...

83
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:41,340
“We are sending MS-13 out by the thousands."

84
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,400
But they may actually be picking up the gang’s

85
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,900
victims.

86
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,159
The targets of MS-13 violence are the exact
same Salvadoran-American immigrants who are

87
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,999
the targets of MS-13's recruitment.

88
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:57,620
It can be hard to tell who’s really in the
gang and who’s just adopting gang style.

89
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,529
Kids in high school will wear Chicago Bulls
t-shirts or will wear Nike Cortez sneakers.

90
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,839
And that is a sign of the gang but it’s
also just a sign of a high school kid trying

91
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,839
to look tough.

92
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:14,149
It's the same thing you saw in the 90s, you
saw kids who would have like a blue bandana

93
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:19,860
to try to act like Snoop Dogg, but that didn't
mean that they were Crips.

94
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,800
If we're trying to send a message that we
don't want MS-13 in the U.S, but that message

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,490
comes at the cost of hurting the exact same
people who MS-13 is victimizing, is that really

96
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,699
the right way to go forward?

97
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,319
For any policy to work, it’s worth keeping
the facts front and center.

98
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,009
MS-13 is not invading the country.

99
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:43,089
They’re neither a new phenomenon nor growing
in numbers.

100
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:49,599
But they have committed acts of horrific violence,
mostly against other immigrants, in specific

101
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,599
communities.

102
00:06:50,599 --> 00:00:00,000
And that -- is still an American problem.
