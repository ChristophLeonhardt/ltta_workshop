ROBERT MUELLER. THAT IS FALSE. ANOTHER EMAIL STATING MUELLER IS THE ONLY HOPE FOR TRUTH. OVER TO YOU. POLLS OPENING IN FOUR KEY PRIMARY RACES, INDIANA, NORTH CAROLINA, OHIO AND WEST VIRGINIA AND DEMOCRATS HOPING TO TURN THE BLUE WAVE INTO A SOON ARMY. CAN REPUBLICANS KEEP CONTROLLING CONGRESS? JOINING ME TO DEBATE IS RON MYRON FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR RICHARD FOWLER. I WILL START WITH YOU. DO YOU THINK DEMOCRATS WILL BE ABLE TO TURN THIS BLUE WAVE INTO A SOON ARMY? THEY ARE HAVING AN INTERNAL DEBATE BETWEEN BERNIE SOCIALISTS WHO WANT THEM TO RUN ON THE ECONOMY AND NORMAL ESTABLISHMENT RESIST DEMOCRATS WHO JUST WANT THEM TO RUN AGAINST TRUMP. THE BERNIE SOCIALISTS WANT TO RUN ON THE ECONOMY WHEN UNDER A CAPITALIST PRESIDENT EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC IS SUCCEEDING RIGHT NOW. AS FAR AS PRIMARY ELECTIONS TODAY DEMOCRATS HAVE NO CHOICE WHICH WAY THEY WANT TO GO. AND THE QUESTION IS WILL REPUBLICANS GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER. IS THAT THE BIGGER ISSUE? SOMETHING IN THE PENNSYLVANIA 18TH A COUPLE MONTHS AGO WHEN DEMOCRATS WON OVERWHELMINGLY. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BERNIE SANDERS BUT RUNNING CANDIDATES THAT UNDERSTAND THE DISTRICT AND HAVE A TOUGH CONVERSATION WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. TAKE WEST VIRGINIA FOR EXAMPLE. A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE WAS A TEACHER STRIKE WHERE ALL 55 COUNTIES DECIDED TO GO OUT ON STRIKE BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT GETTING PAID ENOUGH. WHO WAS STANDING WITH THEM AND SUPPORTING THEM? JOE MANCHIN. THEY WILL REMEMBER HIM TODAY AND IN NOVEMBER. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAVING THESE HONEST CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, DECREASE THE COST OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND HOW TO SOLVE THE OPIOID CRISIS. JILLIAN: WILL THAT BE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO WIN? IT IS UP TO THE REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE TO LEARN FROM RUNNING ON LOCAL ISSUES WAS LAST TUESDAY IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA, EVERY ELECTION WHERE REPUBLICANS PUT PEOPLE UP WE WON SO THE BLUE WAVE WAS STOPPED AND WE HAD A MINI RED WAVE BECAUSE LOCAL ISSUES, SIMPLE MESSAGING. DONALD TRUMP IS ABLE TO WIN IN 2016, HE WAS ABLE TO TARGET AREAS WITH A UNIQUE MESSAGE FOR THEM IN THE RUSTBELT, TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND JOBS. OF CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES AND SENATE CANDIDATES CAN LEARN FROM THAT AND LOCALIZED ISSUES HAVE SIMPLE MESSAGING AND GO AWAY FROM THE TYPICAL GOP TALKING POINTS THEY CAN WIN. A STATE REP IN OHIO IS A GOOD EXAMPLE, SHE IS A MILLENNIAL YOUNGER THAN 30, RUNNING ON LOCAL ISSUES AND PRO-TRUMP AND ABLE TO PULL OFF AN UPSET TODAY, CANDIDATES CAN WIN BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOMETHING BEYOND RUNNING IS A GENERIC REPUBLICAN IN THE LAST DECADE. DEMOCRATS IF YOU CONSIDER HOW HILLARY CLINTON RAN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP IN 2016 BECAUSE LOOK AT THE FACTS SO MUCH OF HER MESSAGE WAS ANTI-TRUMP, DO YOU THINK THAT IS GOING TO WORK THIS TIME? IT IS DIFFERENT FROM CONGRESSIONAL OR SENATE RACE. WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE LATELY, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WILL ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND REPUBLICANS DELIVERED A TAX BILL THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR A LOT OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES AND UNION SUPPORT HAS GONE DOWN TREMENDOUSLY. THE PRES. ISN'T TALKING ABOUT HIS TAX-CUT PLAN BUT THE ECONOMY, DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE A QUESTION OF WHAT IS LEFT ON THE TABLE. THEY PROMISED IT INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE AND LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE OPIOID CRISIS. WE ARE STILL WAITING AND DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH VOTERS AND LOCAL DISTRICTS IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE OPIOID BILL DROPPING IN JUNE, INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD BE MOVING FORWARD AND TAX CUTS ARE BENEFITING THOSE DEMOGRAPHICS YOU MENTIONED IN EVERY LOW-INCOME, MIDDLE INCOME GROUP ESPECIALLY IN THE RUSTBELT AND PENNSYLVANIA, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE REPUBLICANS NEED TO WIN SO RUNNING AGAINST THE TEXTILE, GOOD LUCK. SOUND GOOD BUT THE TRUTH IS IF YOU TALK TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN OHIO AND KENTUCKY AND INDIANA THEY WILL SAY THE MAJORITY OF THE BENEFIT GOES TO CORPORATIONS
