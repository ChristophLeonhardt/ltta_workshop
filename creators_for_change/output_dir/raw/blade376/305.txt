the moment what is happening now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

8

00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,320

22
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:21,500
cheers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you're wondering whether</font>

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,570
I'm holding the left all others I don't

24
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,130
if it came<font color="#CCCCCC"> out well on the camera house</font>

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,700
standing out there oh I saw was in the

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,560
sky was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she left to me that was</font>

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,979
sunlight shining bright across the

28
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:36,800
weather in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sky was gray and dark</font>

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,500
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left side but as he looked</font>

30
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,260
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right it was dark here on the</font>

31
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,390
ground but<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it was bright sunlight</font>

32
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:46,550
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it I'm going to talk about</font>

33
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,810
well it just made me think about

34
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,810
contrast and of course contrast is when

35
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,240
there's a difference between two

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,450
separate things and I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the sky</font>

37
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I for really bribe their read arc</font>

38
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,430
but it it amazed<font color="#CCCCCC"> me I don't understand</font>

39
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:05,090
why when you see to split contrast are

40
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,860
thinking more about the weather you know

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">dark clouds burst bright clouds I've had</font>

42
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,150
conversations before about your favorite

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">type of weather and I said mine was when</font>

44
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,530
it's really hot and sunny but it's also

45
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,810
raining which two completely opposite

46
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,610
things or win as a funder store but

47
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,459
there's bright sunshine as well so I was

48
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:23,900
out there trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault going through</font>

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,580
my head and I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

50
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,920
things to deal with contrast and I

51
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,269
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of another really good one which</font>

52
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:32,660
was music now as a lot of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

53
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,370
into my heavy music but people usually

54
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:37,220
get complete all people usually make the

55
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,810
assumptions that because I'm into heavy

56
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,269
music I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like shouting which isn't</font>

57
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,970
true music that appeals to me has

58
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,489
contrast I like music the cage really

59
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">heavy but goes very melodic as well I</font>

60
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,900
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you sort of know I mean so</font>

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,390
one minute will be locate the shouting

62
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,980
vocals and then next minute will be

63
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,430
really melodic ballads really powerful

64
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,239
epic stuff and yeah I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

65
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you is</font>

66
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,989
what do you think amazes you the most in

67
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:08,150
life and I thought actually if I put it

68
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,459
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's contrast</font>

69
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,560
and as I said for my last video peaks

70
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,230
and troughs which was the title<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

71
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,820
won't know it's the bad times in<font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font>

72
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,680
until you've experienced the good and

73
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,970
you won't experience the good until

74
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,980
you've experienced the bad that's

75
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,709
contrast everything in life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know</font>

76
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,080
the way you feel about something at

77
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,350
point in time will be based on

78
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,540
from time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's what</font>

79
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,460
dominates just us as human beings is the

80
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,430
way we like take one moment and compare

81
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,490
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next or take one thing and</font>

82
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,010
compare it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next and I guess if</font>

83
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,570
you just think about it I don't know

84
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,160
really know where this<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocks go in but</font>

85
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,720
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an interesting thought ahead</font>

86
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm sure you could put it</font>

87
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,280
on anything you had in life I mean as

88
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go around do things and you</font>

89
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,780
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff a lot of its to do with</font>

90
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,600
contrast is how you make judgments it's

91
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,090
how you enjoy things that's how you feel

92
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,720
emotion towards things and when I was

93
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,730
looking out there contrast came to mind

94
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:12,400
and I think hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out where on</font>

95
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,920
the webcam there it symbolizes greatly

96
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,850
to differences so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one thing</font>

97
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,829
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be watching this and you may</font>

98
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,660
think it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lame video but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

99
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,740
reason you'll think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a laying</font>

100
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,360
video is because you've seen one better

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,480
and if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good video</font>

102
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,520
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm afraid to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

103
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,560
seen a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of lame videos so those were</font>

104
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,690
my thoughts and i'll be doing a few more

105
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,910
videos surely but I've got exams coming

106
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,020
up so I could concentrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them</font>

107
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,350
place your thoughts of your experiences

108
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,940
with contrast if you put into that

109
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,790
perspective this contrasts dominate our

110
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:50,950
life see around people oh whoops unplug

111
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,820
the mouse stuff to use the Edit<font color="#CCCCCC"> lame</font>

112
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,840
touchpad thing

113
00:04:55,840 --> 00:00:00,000
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>
