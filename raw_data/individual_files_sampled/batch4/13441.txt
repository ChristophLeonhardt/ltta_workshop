the New York Times a former newspaper is apologizing for being the New York Times a former newspaper in the midst of running hit pieces against Republicans that are skewed biased and often untrue it ran a hit piece against a Republican that was skewed biased and untrue and so has taken time out from unfairly denigrating Republicans to apologize for having unfairly denigrated a Republican the piece that squeezed the soul and little apology out of the leftist birdcage liner was an attack on UN Ambassador nikki Haley the article by Time State Department correspondent Gardner Harris was linked to the headline Nikki Haley's view of New York is priceless her Curtin's fifty two thousand seven hundred and one dollars a picture of ambassador Haley accompany the article the first paragraph went like this quote the State Department spent fifty two thousand seven hundred and one dollars last year buying customized and mechanized curtains for the picture windows in Nicki are Haley's official residents as ambassador to the United Nations just as the department was undergoing deep budget cuts and had frozen hiring unquote six paragraphs down the times added this little tidbit quote a spokesman for miss Haley said plans to buy the curtains were made in 2016 during the Obama administration miss Haley had no say in the purchase he said unquote that's right the curtains were ordered by the Obama people probably so then ambassador Samantha Power's could close the curtains what so no one could see her unmasking his spine on US citizens New York Times editor blithering prevarication the third issued an apology for the article writing quote in our mad rush to unfairly denigrate a Republican we accidentally unfairly denigrated a Republican in a manner that made it apparent that our once-great paper while still maintaining his former appearance has now become a corrupt and dishonest mouthpiece of the socialist wing of the Democrat Party we regret revealing that and will be careful to unfairly denigrate Republicans more subtly in the future okay the New York Times didn't really print that that would have been the truth which has no place in the New York Times trigger

lie awake on these sheets and ponder the great questions of life like how do you spell Clavin oh it's que la vie a n so this thing about Cavanaugh I'm sure you've all heard it a woman has come forward a professor who says that in high school Brett Kavanaugh got drunk lay on top of her tried to pull off her clothes she felt he was trying to rape her and then she escaped they were both drunk everybody was drunk and she has now come forward at first she didn't she didn't it was a letter that Diane Feinstein senator Diane Feinstein had in her possession for weeks and weeks and then she finally said I'm turning it over but the woman wasn't named and now she has come forward and and his it says she will testify Cavanaugh says that the whole thing is untrue and if he too will testify he completely denies it but he says that he will now he's willing to go back and and testify about these things in which he just says never happened now I want to talk about this I'm gonna talk about the fact that I don't believe these charges and why I don't believe the charges sorry I just want to make sure I know what I'm talking about there why I don't believe the charges but before I talk about that I want to talk about something else I want to talk about what what about the fact what about if the charges are absolutely true what about if the charges are absolutely true her name is Christine Blasi for does that is if I got her name of Christine Blasi for it I think that's it so I want to talk about what if this 53 year old man of impeachable character what if one night in high school when he was 17 he got drunk and felt up a high school girl who was also drunk I don't care I don't care I don't give one rats hair about that I do not care if now I don't care if you were a left winger if you were as left as left could be if he used the Constitution for toilet paper I would want him turned down from the Supreme Court for that but for this no freakin way I don't care this is if it's true which I don't think it is I want to be very clear clear about this if a man of unimpeachable character right this is a guy that everybody says is a great guy they FBI has investigated him six times six times nothing has come up they pull this at the last minute after the hearings are over so he can't defend himself he has to come back to defend himself so the press has a chance to go through the whole weekend just you know absolutely attacking him but let's just say let us just pretend for a minute that this is true I don't care if this were a young woman being appointed judge and it turned out that she had had an abortion which at least is permanent as something you can't take back right I mean this is he you know he felt her up but he didn't rape her or anything like that that would be a different story that's not the story we're telling his story that he just got on top of her team altar if this were a woman who had had an abortion when she was 16 or 17 he said you know I did a terrible thing I really feel bad about it you know but I was 16 17 I panicked I wouldn't care either why not because teenagers have got to be able to be teenagers what kind of compassionless small-minded puritanical pinched closed hearted view of human life are we going to we're going to live with to serve our politics if people cannot be teenagers and make a mistake that is obscene to me I've told you many times that I think a new Victorian age is coming in lots of ways and lots of very positive ways but if it means if it means that a person cannot get a job a high place job because he did something one night when he got drunk in high school again not a rape not a murder not something that's you know completely permanent destroys lives just a little bit of you know bad behavior as a high school are you kidding me are you kidding me which of us I mean nobody can can survive that we've all done bad things everybody has done a bad thing and who in Congress what man in Congress surely is not gonna have some story from his high school you know is that really the standard that the left wants to set is it really the standard and I say this again if he were a leftist I still still would not hold this against them that if we can't be children if we can't be teenagers if we can't have flaws if we can't be human beings who's left who is good who is gonna be a judge over us who's gonna sit on the Supreme Court someone who knows nothing about the foibles of humankind who is you know everything about our Constitution is built with a knowledge of the foibles of humankind that's why they pitched powers against each other are we really to serve our lousy politics our mean ugly stupid low politics are we really going to abandon our compassion for human beings such that we we will allow people who have never done anything to serve us that is absurd I don't care if it's true now here's why I don't think it's true I mean there are lots of reasons why I don't think it's true this lady you know I don't I don't I'm not gonna attack her maybe she remembers this maybe she doesn't she told it to a therapist in 2012 this is the first thing she told it to it there in the story to a therapist in 2012 30 years after it happened she has never told it to anyone before that he was trying to take off her bathing suit the story in the therapist note don't mint match the story that she's telling now they don't name Kavanagh and they say that there were four men in the room now she says that there's two men in the room you know but this she says that's the therapists fault she took the notes wrong how on earth how on earth do you defend yourself against the charge like that how on earth do you defend yourself so I dismiss it on that the the woman christine Blasi Ford has a hazy recollection of the energy of the incident she was drunk she doesn't remember what happened this the idea ice men shinned this before but the idea that they released this hear this charge after the healing was over they did the same thing this is the Anita Hill playbook this is the Anita Hill playbook Anita Hill came forward and I didn't care about that either the only in with Clinton I didn't want Clinton to be impeached for what what he did the only thing about Clinton was it was revelatory of his constant character Bill Clinton's affair that he had in the offices that we pay for was revelatory of his constant character he was constantly using and abusing women for his pleasure he was constantly using and abusing Hillary for his power you know I mean she treated her like garbage and she didn't like it very much by according to all accounts so that said something about his character this says nothing about the guy however again Kavanagh has been investigated six times there all these women who have come forward and said that he was a wonderful guy I guess 65 women signed an affidavit the left's response to that was that proves he's a bad guy why would he have to have so many people come forward if you know if he didn't it wasn't defending iming else himself against something so the more people who come forward to defend you if you happen to be a conservative that condemns you that if that's what condemns you the other thing about this woman and and this is important it well let me get to that in a minute I want to talk about the way her students she's a teacher a professor I want to talk about the fact that the way her students reacted but first Cavanaugh's mother who was a circuit court judge once ruled against her parents that's something that may give her a grudge and finally she is a very left-wing Bernie supporting Democrat who donates the left-wing causes and has previously signed an open letter challenging Trump's border policy some people said for instance that well when she first talked about this it was 2012 and so Cavanaugh but she didn't mention Cavanaugh at the time it seems like so why would she say it then Cavanaugh wasn't going to be in the Supreme Court in 2012 but MIT Romney said he would pick Cavanaugh - he put Cavanaugh a very high on his list so that she may have had a grudge against him political grudge against them - so I'm gonna get back to her her students in just a minute but this is is such is it this is such baloney is such a baloney thing to do these guys will do anything to protect the left will do anything to protect their power from the Constitution they do not want that evil Constitution coming and taking their power away let us talk about light stream because I know you know you have that credit card I do this all the time I have my credit card it's like it's not even money you know it's just a little plastic card you hand it to somebody then the bill comes due

offers are subject to change without notice visit light stream comm / Andrew for more information one more thing about this the accuser Christine placing for dr. Christine blazing forward she has rated her students you know they give students give ratings to their teachers some of the things they say about her are for instance something is wrong with her she says she holds grudges against students who cross her here's one of the one of the things a student wrote and these are before these charges came forward these are likened from 2014 Christine Ford is the worst educator I have ever experienced avoid taking her class and avoid any interaction with this person I feel like she has something wrong with her and I'm surprised no one has caught this another one professor Ford is unprofessional lacks appropriate filters and I'm honestly scared of her she's like you know both the Roger Kimble and Myron magnet two of the smartest human beings I know Myron magnet who was at City Journal and Roger Kimble who often writes for The Spectator they are two of the smartest people I always tease Kimble because he wears a bowtie say he's the only man in America who wears a bowtie and means it because that's how smart he is they both were comparing this to the Anita Hill playbook and neither Hill they told the Nita hell she wasn't gonna have to testify ultimately it became this enormous circuit circus they will say anything they will do anything that will slander anyone to stop their power from being taken away by the Constitution I have to say it's like it's like watching some kind of demon snake writhing in the hands of the people who are trying to pry the snake off the tower of its power you know it's like I cannot i am the snake of power you will not take me away from my power it's it's insane and viciousness the viciousness and the the idea of what it is doing to our sense of what it means to be a human being is it's despicable it is it really is it really is terrible you there was so much that Nikki Haley's story which is appalling that thing where they they basically accused her of buying these curtains for whatever was fifty three thousand dollars and it was really Samantha power under in the Obama administration they buried that it's only because they got caught I mean they just ran they finally ran this note at the top of the story that's a little unfair of us you know maybe I was buzzed but we still don't like her you know it's like what what on earth what on earth do you when you go to work at the New York Times and you're tying your tie or shaving your face in the morning or putting on your makeup in the morning and you look at yourself in the mirror what do you think of yourself if you're working for that paper you have to think that you are so wonderful yet your philosophy is so great that is worth lying and twisting things the other one was this hurricane story the hurricane story of Hurricane Maria and hurricane Irma which hit three weeks earlier in Puerto Rico and they put out this story that there were an estimated it was the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University found that from September 2017 through this February there are an estimated 2975 excess mortalities income in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico meaning three thousand people who died who wouldn't have died if the hurricane hadn't hit and so President Trump pushed back and he tweeted last week that three thousand people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico and that when he visited soon after Maria the toll was between six people and 18 so just to show you the measured careful way that the press reacted judging you know these 3,000 people who wouldn't have died against Trump's tweet here's a perfect example of the way the press treated this Jennifer Rubin on MSNBC Donald Trump has killed it those people twice once through neglect and oversight and secondly disgracing that they died at all and that's what death denial that's what Holocaust denial that's what all these denial syndromes are all about is killing the person twice that seems fair Donald Trump's another tweet it was like he flew to Puerto Rico denied the Holocaust and then left upon these people and strangled them to death you know it's exactly what it was like Jake Tapper he just called it a lie he was citing the Governor of Puerto Rico who wants to be a Democrat presidential candidate what you know is it's insane so marry Anastasius O'Grady I love her name she sounds like a nun she's but in fact she is the Latin America correspondent columnist for The Wall Street Journal so she wrote a piece today and she said you know it this is it's Trump is in the right of this he was being treated unfairly their excess mortality first of all is not the normal way that you judge how many people died in a hurricane you judge how many people died in our ranking by how many people are killed during the hurricane excess mortality studies aren't the way you count the dead because who knows why people died who knows how can you say well you know he his car crashed into a tree but it might not have if there hadn't been a hurricane three days before you know it's just it's just not fair but the point about this is is that there aren't any other measures other hurricanes that have been measured in that way so there's no way to compare the deaths in Puerto Rico to other places other hurricanes so because the case they're trying to make is that Trump and the and FEMA kind of botched the hurricane thing and then they sell this on CNN oh he doesn't care about brown people you know the routine they do it a hundred times a million times you've seen it and seen it and seen it but it's all it's all ridiculous I mean the point that Mary Oh Grady makes in the Wall Street Journal is that the attack on Trump is a disservice to Puerto Ricans this is her writing she says it helps the island politicians dodge their own responsibility for the loss of life the failure of medical equipment due to power outages for example may have been one cause of numerous post storm deaths but as Mary Williams Walsh detailed in a New York Times story titled how free electricity helped big nine billion dollar hole in Puerto Rico Island officials mismanaged the power company for years which left the grid highly vulnerable when the storm hit in fact she says local government was thoroughly unprepared for Maria according to the George Washington University study neither the Department of Public Safety nor the central communications office in the governor's office had written crisis and emergency risk communication plans in place the health department's Office of Emergency Preparedness and response had an outdated emergency plan you know I'm trying to make a general point here a general point because of the left because the left owns the press because the left owns the media because they have been hysterical about every Republican since Reagan and are now hysterical about Donald Trump who I will admit gives them more cause for hysteria both by the fact that he's more effective than most presidents and by the fact that he behaves badly at times they have lost all a sense of what they are supposed to be doing they have lost all sense of truth they've lost boss just you know this Russian thing the Russian collusion investigation if it comes out as I'm almost positive it will that Trump had nothing to do with you know was not colluding with Russia to do whatever colluding means I mean colluding there's not even a law against colluding it not we cope there but but if it turns out that there was no collusion between Trump and Russia during the campaign as I'm almost certain it will when Muller is finished with his investigation what have they been doing to us for the last two years you know what have they been doing to us for the last two years let me pause for just a second I'll talk about that a little bit more but I got to talk about Beachbody on demand the reason I got to talk about is because I know you're distracted listening to me talk by how great I look you're thinking how do I get in shape like that when I walk I'm running around all the time I don't have time to go to the gym I'm in hotels I'm in cars I'm at home and trying to work all the

30 and there you got it Beachbody on demand so Bob Woodward you know brought out this book fear or as I call it yeah fear it's a Donald Trump's presidency and all they talk about is Oh Donald Trump is chaotic and he's you know crazy and all the stuff but they forgot that they didn't read the book and I haven't read the book either but Hugh Hewitt has and Hugh Hewitt had Woodward on his radio show and asked him did you find any evidence of collusion here's Woodward's response did you Bob Woodward hear anything in your research in your interviews that sounded like espionage or collusion I did not and of course I looked for it looking for it hard and so you know there we are we're gonna see what Muller has and Dowd maybe right he has something that Dowd and the president don't know about a secret witness or somebody who changed their testimony as you know that often happens and that can break open or turn a case but you've seen no collusion I have not alright so there you know legendary reporter is the roll call him when he attacks Trump is he a legendary reporter now is he a legendary reporter now that he's got Trump off the hook I mean this is this Russian collusion thing which by the way when they when Muller comes out if Muller comes out and says you know there's no collusion but between Trump and Russia it will vanish like that it's already vanishing all they do is they go from collusion when that doesn't work they go oh he's insane then they go to the next thing he's insane whatever the next outrage oh he's killed he flew down to Puerto Rico while denying the Holocaust and slaughtered 3,000 people twice he brought them back to life and killed them again I mean they are out of their minds they're out of their minds and if nothing else is making him look great which is like not that easy to do alright coming up tomorrow September 18th at 6:30 p.m. Eastern 3:30 Pacific don't miss our next episode of daily wire backstage with ben shapiro the one and only the god

reporter producer and host of the blaze show the news and why it matters sara has written for several publications including the blaze and red state hey nemesis good to see you I'm great thanks for having me it's a pleasure what is the news and why it matters the news and why it matters which by the way I did not pick the title I realize it does not flow off of the tongue you might want it to however it is very important because we live in an age where we're just inundated with all of these different media outlets just pummeling you with all of these different stories some of which really may not matter to you in your life so we try to take the stories that actually matter you know to our audience and to America and just try to fit it into a 30 minute show on television and then we go over time on on demand and on podcast where we fit in a little bit more a little bit extra but we just Americans don't have that much time to sift through what's important to them so we try to help them out with you pick the story they got said man what story matters today today today we're gonna be talking Cavanaugh it's got to be brought down tonight yes yeah I said something maybe a little controversial at the open air show I said even if he's guilty if this story is true which I don't believe it is but if it's true I don't care so you tell me why I'm wrong well I'm not going to tell you that you're necessarily wrong I am gonna tell you it matters to America just based upon the fact that you know it's it's something that everyone wants to know but being that he even if this was true he's he was 17 at the time yeah you know kids are allowed to make mistakes in high school you know and I mean we live in an age now where even you know adults can make mistakes let's say James Gunn you can make a mistake you can repent for it you can apologize for it before it even surfaces in the mainstream media then you get attacked for it and then you lose your career over it and I think that we're seeing this happen to everyone at such a rate that eventually we're gonna get to the place where nobody's gonna be able to keep a job because everyone's done something in their past that could come back to haunt them if we judge everyone by what they did 30 40 50 years ago it's a horrible way to look at the world it's a horrible way to look at humanity with you know no you know the comedian or McDonald yes he said recently that when you admit to these especially these me to offenses when you admit that to them you get destroyed yeah whereas if you deny them you might survive yeah I mean it's kind of unfair well it isn't I mean we're living in a time where you know we're supposed to live in a country where we are innocent until proven guilty but the court of public opinion is a very harsh court and apparently you know you can lose your job lose everything just based on what someone accuses you of with no evidence I mean it's we live in a post fact era for sure well now at the blaze I mean one of the things I've always admired Glenn for is that he's he's actually living on air in real time you can see him change his mind sometimes you can see him and he has been you know he's written this book addicted to outrage and he's talking about the fact that we're at each other's throats yes is there anything that you feel like as a as a person in front of a camera with a microphone is there anything that you feel that you should be doing to mitigate that well what we try to do especially on the show which generates some really great conversations is we try to just look at things objectively and you can say you know for instance we had a conversation and not too long ago about being pro-life you know obviously we're all very very pro-life and we had a story come up about the death penalty and so you know I posed the question you know we say that we're very pro-life we're all on the side of pro death penalty so how do we reconcile that so I think that the key to that the key to understanding America is addicted to outrage and we need to break that cycle is we have to be introspective and we have to look inside ourselves and say okay we need to make sure that we're being objective and we need to make sure that we're making sure that you know we're calling ourselves before we call out the other side I mean I think that that's very very key yeah absolutely true that we have to do that what do you say to people because this is the response I get to this all the time and just this this week this nikki Haley last week the nikki Haley yes I mean that was scurrilous and there's no there was not a mistake that was not an accident that was a good job on nikki Haley hater and they do it every day it's I mean I read The Times every day mostly for the satire but I mean it they do it every day so what do you say to people who say if we play by the rules and if we get into the ring wearing gloves and saying we're gonna fight by the Marquess of Queensbury rules and they get in with an ox it's not fair I mean shouldn't we fight back it's it's a very it's a very slippery slope it's a very slippery slope and you know you can only do that to a certain point until we just we've completely destroyed each other and there's nothing left so you know I do think that there there is some sort of awakening happening right now even with the left you know you look at Alexandria Acacio Cortez and a lot of the mainstream moderate Democrats have come out against her and said what are you talking about or you you have no idea how you're gonna pay for this you know we need to look at something better so I think that there is a little bit of an awakening happening and if we can use that as a catalyst and take the high ground instead of constantly getting down in the mud with the other side we're gonna come out better wow that's the most optimistic thing anybody said to me 2018 I think well I work with Glenn Beck's like some way to get some optimism in there absolutely true where do you place Trump in all this I mean what do you think the effect of him has been Hurricane trumpism yes hurricane Trump I mean he certainly doesn't help it I dunno you know Stu Berg here Glenn's co-host does always like to say he just doesn't like to pay attention to anything that he says that he tweets anything like that just look at policies in particular I I can see what he would want to do that but you know anytime that our president is coming out saying anything controversial you know I just wish someone would take away his Twitter really just take away his phone but he doesn't help he doesn't help that but he's fighting with the media and he's in this constant battle with you know who is going to be the martyr and who is going to you know be the winner in this one particular battle and it doesn't I feel like as the president of the United States he should take the high road it doesn't always happen I wish that he would because then we could at least say hey the leader of the Republican Party is the one setting the example for everyone else but you know if someone has someone has to do it first and sure ain't gonna be the media well then that is the thing I mean that is the answer to this you know I know a lot of people sometimes me who say if you know I mean if we could take twit Trump's Twitter away the guy would be on the $20 bill at this point what he's done a lot of really nice and done a lot of things with the press screaming that we were all gonna die I've seen that before I mean Giuliani did that in New York he transformed in New York he was called the racist every single day by the New York Times Reagan did it and he was called all those names they said everything about Reagan that they say about Trump obviously different people but still yeah what do you say to people who say he's fighting back I mean we watched the George W Bush and Karl Rove has admitted this we watched or W Bush just taken on the chin day after day too dignified to presidential to fight back Trump fights back and a lot of people especially his base say yeah it's about time there's a way to fight back in which you're still not going negative so you could point out you know the New York Times had a misleading article about me it was completely false and then you could say you know look at the economy look at look at these statistics look at the jobs and you could say you can fight back in a way that you're not getting down in the dirt you're not calling the press the enemy of the country you know you're not making these inflammatory remarks but you're still pointing out look at all these things that I've done a good job on look at the economy numbers look I mean these are actual statistics that he could be spouting off to everyone anytime anything negative is said about him and it's he just he chooses to get in the mud every single time instead of sticking to all of the positive things he could say I mean one of the reasons I think he's both effective and harms himself he's actually one of them he is one of the media he said he's a media guy yeah and so he understands he understands that he can't let the attacks stand but he also fights back in the same way they fight with him I mean everything they do to him he does back to them yeah and a lot of us I mean I get a lot of Glee out of that when he's right you know but it can be it can be awful so when I look at the polls and I look at the economy and I think everybody is thinking this like we're we're where is his popularity and it there's a lot of reasons why he doesn't have it if you're talking to an ordinary person by which I mean somebody who's not in the media they must still be people who left who are not in the movie what would you say to them you know how what if you were gonna write a book said how to watch the news what would it say how to watch the news don't watch the news I think that you know you have to decide for yourself what your principles are what you what is important to you so you know I mean a big part of the reason that Trump won that the Democrats completely overlooked was you know what we call flyover nation so there are these people that you know they're middle class and they they're historically Democrat right they voted for Obama but they were finding that the Democrats we're not paying attention to them they were paying attention to the lgbtq XYZ Brigade and they were paying attention to you know the bathroom rules and they're paying paying attention to all of these things and they left out a giant portion of the nation so you know these people are saying my paycheck is important to me you know where my money goes is important to me you know my my job is important to me and they're leaving all of those people out so I think that you know they need to watch the news according to what is important to them and their life which again is where we have the news in my matter that is very good advice and yeah the news and why it matters is good thing I have to ask you one more question a personal question but because I saw this online yeah is the only reason for those many people listen to the show if then they can't see you you're absolutely lovely and you look like a fashion model yeah but you wait a hundred pounds more yes I saw a picture of you you were I was fat we can say that how did you we're not people we're not that was I was I was very bad so I it was a little over it's probably twelve years ago and I was in my last semester at college and I just decided I wanted to go into law enforcement and so I wanted to get ready for that I knew I couldn't do it being so overweight so low carb exercise every day so no sugar no bread well yes and I did it it took me two years okay you a hundred pounds yeah I did it the right way right I did it the right way so it took me two years and I got pregnant gay a little bit of weight back with pregnancy and then lost it again Wow just with the same style modification you still live that way Wow yeah I'm impressed yeah I I haven't touched a carbon 10 years now every once in a while every once in a while I make make an exception very impressive shower Gonzales the news and why it matters on the blaze really nice talking to you and I hope I hope to see you again soon thank you so much for having me I have to show you one thing from the Weather Channel if you haven't seen this yet it's been all over online but do we have this clip of this guy pretending that he's walking into the wind to show you how bad the hurricane is just play this clip ok picking it up here and Wilmington North Carolina right at the Intracoastal and we're in one of these bands this is about us nasty as it's been we had some fans like this last night and then the eyewall this morning we were not on TV it was the dark hen raucous night at the hotel and this wind gusting again over 60 miles an hour he's blowing by basis of limbs hilariously what's happening is if you can't see it he's pretending to lean into this powerful wind while two people stroll by and back him clearly unaffected and if you watch the plants the wind is blowing the same direction he's leaning it squeezed not even in the right direction so if we distrust the news media just a little bit from time to time like think feeling they're all a bunch of liars and lowlifes that's why that is a perfect it's only like a metaphor it's like a metaphor for the rest of the media all right our crappy culture today as I'm sure each and every one of you knows is Constitution Day did anybody know that but means yes everybody now that's why I like that I'd love to see this Constitution judged on federal judge Don Willett has a piece in The Wall Street Journal in which he recounts the famous story Benjamin Franklin who made the last great speech of his life urging the signing of the Constitution with as he said all its flaws and after he signed it he came out and the people of the crowd in Philadelphia shouted at him what have we got we got a monarchy or a republic and Franklin said you've got a republic if you can keep it and the judge will it writes that the constant Constitution inaugurated a revolutionary design Madisonian architecture infused with Newtonian genius three separate co-equal branches locked in synchronous orbit by competing interests ambition counteracting ambition but the truly extraordinary element was that these three rival branches derived their power from three unrivaled words inscribed on the page in supersize script We the People and he talks about he poached Thomas Jefferson wherever the people are well-informed they can be trusted with their own government so let's see here's how informed that people are my friends at campus reform we love these guys went out and now there's actually two years ago I think they went out and asked people whether the Constitution was being treated as if it were too important if people were paying too much attention to the Constitution here's what they said I feel like sometimes people use the Constitution as an excuse to not think and do not work towards progress I come from North Carolina and there are a lot of people in that area who I think take the Constitution two serious constitutions written it was kind of vague and using the language that we don't use anymore as a lot of people just don't understand what it means in a large part I think the text of the Constitution itself and a lot of the amendments are probably taking a little bit too seriously that attitude has a lot to do with sort of like our I don't know path dependent reliance on the Constitution the way we're sometimes afraid to think I don't know in more utopian ways a lot of arguments and in someone saying oh well this is what the Constitution says so therefore this is what it is people tend to want to read the Constitution very strictly when in reality it's a living document a change of the time you know we have to keep updating like we would update anything after you know like the dictionary is updated like once a week I mean I think the founding fathers definitely didn't intend for the Constitution to have I mean just direct interpretation I don't believe in direct interpretation of the Constitution so so we're in deep deep trouble I like the girl who said they said it prevents us from thinking utopian thoughts in a more utopian way that's its purpose that is the purpose of the Constitution it was written by people who knew it was written by people who understood what human beings are how flawed they are how sinful they are how ambitious how selfish they are and it poke it pitted us against one another to keep the government from taking away our freedoms which is it's natural the natural thing that it does study more learn more don't be don't be any moron you know figure out what why they wrote the Constitution it can be changed there's nothing wrong with changing it and updating it but but it is one of the greatest political Dockett is the greatest political document ever made you know there's only one original radical political thought one and that is that you should govern yourself everything else is Pharaoh everything else is Pharaoh maybe Pharaoh for equality it may be Pharaoh for you know because we can run the economy better than you can it may be Pharaoh because we're the experts and you're not it's all Pharaoh except for the Constitution except for the idea that you should govern yourself it's a radical idea we do not want to lose it we should cling to it with everything we have got all right some of you may have noticed that Michael Knowles wasn't here today I didn't but some of you may have that
