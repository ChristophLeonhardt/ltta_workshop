♪ ♪ SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP REMAINS STRONG IN TENNESSEE. THAT IS GOOD NEWS FOR REPUBLICAN BLACKBURN WHO IS WIDENING HER LEAD AGAINST DEMOCRAT PHIL IN A RACE TO FILL THE SENATE SEAT THERE. PETER DOOCY TAKES A CLOSER LOOK. REPUBLICANS HAVE ONE MORE DAY TO CAMPAIGN ABOUT KAVANAUGH BEFORE MID-TERM VOTERS LEARN HIS FATE. I WOULD VOTE YES ON BRETT KAVANAUGH. AND TENNESSEE CONGRESSWOMAN BLACKBURN IS NOT THE ONLY ONE. THE DEMOCRAT SHE IS RUNNING AGAINST SAID HE WOULD VOTE YES TOO. HE SAID I WAS PREPARED TO SAY YES TO HIS NOMINATION PRIOR TO DR. FORD'S COMING FORWARD. I AM MISSING KEY PIECES OF INFORMATION, I AM STILL A YES. BLACKBURN LEADS AND HER LED HAS GROWN. BREDESEN. THEY WANT PRESIDENCY CONFIRMED. THEY WANT BRETT KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED. THEY WATCHED THIS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION PLAY OUT. THEY ARE HORRIFIED AS TO WHAT THAT COULD MEAN FOR THEIR CHILDREN OR THEIR SIBLINGS OR THEIR SPOUSE. THE TENNESSEE IS TO REPLACE A RETIRING SENATOR. A SENATOR STICKING AROUND GETS MORE ATTENTION FROM BLACKBURN. CHUCK SCHUMER SAID HIS PATH TO THE MAJORITY RUNS THROUGH TENNESSEE. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS A 60% APPROVAL RATING HERE. HE RALLIED FOR HER. EVEN THOUGH BREDESEN DIDN'T HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ENDORSEMENT, HE BORROWED ONE OF HIS FAMOUS WORDS. "SWAMP." BUT BLACKBURN INSISTS SHE AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THE SWAMP. HE IS A GOOD SWAMP DRAINER IN CHIEF. PEOPLE IN TENNESSEE LOVE THAT ABOUT HIM. THIS IS AN ELECTION WHERE VOTERS ARE MORE FIRED UP ABOUT NATIONAL ISSUES THAN STATE-LEVEL ISSUES. THAT PLAYED OUT THIS MORNING DURING THE BLACKBURN BREAKFAST VOTERS BOOED SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN.
