imagine something called a trump file a collection of stories and documents that together catalog much of the president's troubled controversial past it would of course be the Holy Grail to anyone trying to ruin him now ask yourself what would the former no-nonsense businessman do to secure it as it turns out the Trump file isn't really a hypothetical it's or something like it exists or at least once did and new reporting today from the New York Times details the steps Trump was willing to take before the 2016 election to keep it in the right hands quote trumpet his lawyer at the time Michael D Cohen devised a plan to buy up all the dirt on mr. Trump that the National Enquirer and its parent company had collected on him dating back to the 1980s according to several of mr. Trump's associates that report breathing new life into that secret Trump audio recording Cohen released last month at one point the two men hints at a plan I need to hold another company for the transfer of all of that info regarding our friend David you know so that I'm gonna do that right away I've actually come up to me and I just spoke into Alan weiselberger about how to set the whole thing up with yes it's all the stuff because here you never know where that company you never know what he so I'm all over that and I stopped Alan about it when it comes time for the financing which will be joining us at the table Jennifer Palmieri former communications director for the Obama White House and the Clinton campaign Jen starting with you what would you have done to get your hands on the Trump file oh yeah that would have been yeah that would've been worth spending some donor money on that yeah was not good like I have I have a lot of experience in dealing with the National Enquirer because I work for the AdWords campaign sorry to say it sorry to have a lot of experience that and those people are no joke they spend a lot of money they pay sources they stay with the story for a really long time and they hang in there so if they have a file on trembling back to the 80s it's probably something that they've invested a lot of investigative investigatory resources and and I suspect it's about you know I suspect it has to do a lot with women and you believe a lot of it would be true given that yeah I mean that was true that is the thing with the National Enquirer is they will right up to the line of you know they will exaggerate but they're pretty they're relatively they're surprisingly careful about crossing a line and produced in and printing something that's that's demonstrably false at least things that they could possibly get sued over they're very careful in that and they pay a lot of sports just this is why they get things they you know pro tip everyone at the Beverly Hills Hilton is on the Enquirer payroll for real like just flagging be careful if somebody says invites you to a meeting the Beverly Hills Hilton you should be very suspicious good but they they are so they are careful so I think that they have a treasure trove of research on you it's likely to be relatively bulletproof and damaging so here's this was broken by Jim Ruttenberg and Maggie Haines room at the Times and here's a portion of it people with knowledge of American media's operations who would speak only on condition of anonymity describe the files on mr. Trump is mostly older National Enquirer stories about mr. Trump's marital woes and lawsuits related story notes and lists of sensitive sources some tips about alleged affairs and minutiae like allegations of unscrupulous golfing I imagine the unscrupulous golfing Jonathan is a thing that might anger a Donald Trump the most yeah I think that would be considered sort of a blow to his ego and the affair with a porn star or a supermodel maybe not but yes The Associated Press laughs we could also be reporting on this about this vault yes secret safe that the Inquirer had on on Trump and some of which perhaps they collected on their own some of which perhaps working with Michael Cohen and tandem to like take a bad story and put it there so therefore it's not to be put out the public eye but certainly this would be you know perhaps the holy grail of opposition research for someone who was trying to ruin him or run against a lot of this stuff did come out before the election there were there were allegations from women that he harassed them or did worse groped them he's denied all those there were always stories about Affairs out there there were there were there was legal filings from his ex-wife of Ana's saying that that he raped her Donald Trump deny that and she later pulled it back but all of this information was out there so why would why would this be so concerning that Donald Trump and Michael Cohen would want to keep it buried it's true he won anyway let's remember that I mean some of it is perhaps their stuff in there that we don't know about there's something that would cross the line to be more damaging than the litany of things you just you just listed uh you know if depending when the transactions were I mean it could open up into campaign finance violations again depending if this was done last year so that would be a legal front they'd be concerned about and I'm sure would be looked at you know the relationship between the Enquirer and the you know ami and Donald Trump is one that's ever-evolving and I don't think this is the last story we've read about it so Maggie makes the point in a tweet of hers she says what's getting lost here is people are reading our story the file with National Enquirer Trump dirt went back for nearly 20 years long predating Cohen working for Trump this was Trump's concern about controlling information the tape indicates this was not some idea that Cohen came up with but was an expected part of his job he was a fixer after all I want to point out for a second here Katie we're talking about a literal safe filled with Trump dirt that his supposed friend kept in his office and that his other supposed friend taped a conversation of him in the now president talking about taping conversations show look why he's so nervous this is why he said what a world what friends to have mean I know we're laughing about it but it does speak volumes about about the people that he surrounds himself in the way but also the way he operates and the way people feel they need to protect themselves from Tom home from yeah yeah that's right look I'm skeptical that there's anything in this file that would prove that surprising as it relates to Donald Trump and when so why do you want to buy it out I think well probably because he's worried about it coming out before the election but what would it be like that he had sex with a porn star while watching Shark Week you know right after his son was born I mean there's not much that would surprise you the thing that interests me more is the question of money how they were gonna pay for it was this not gonna be out of Donald Trump's pocket his personal money which would be appropriate which would be legal or was this gonna be another example of him trying to use corporate money or maybe Michael Cohen's money that was unreported it as a campaign action doesn't CNY have these files we don't know I mean the peckers cooperating oh he's gotten he's gotten immunity yeah so wouldn't it stand to reason that the if there are these are these files if they're volt did exist and even if they were moved that the SD and Y would say we need those files if we're going to give you immunity it would depend if it was relevant to the case I think they would certainly ask David pecker what they were about and would probably want to look at them they would ask Michael Cohen about them if there was anything that went to their their the case they've been working on I think they would definitely want to see him if it was just gossip from 20 years ago maybe not hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
