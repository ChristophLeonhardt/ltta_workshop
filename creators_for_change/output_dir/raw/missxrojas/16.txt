1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,820
Good Morning. My name is Maryuris
Mosquera Palacio

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,960
We are here today with Mrs.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,720
Zenaida Di Martin

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,460
from the organization, of the association?

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,260
legal representative of the association

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,160
Community Councils Bajo Atrato, ASCOBA.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,340
Zenaida, today we would like
you tell us a little about

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,940
the history of the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,880
It's a very traditional municipality that has

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:45,460
various festivities. It is a town that has always been on the banks of the Atrato

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,390
It has some ancestral customs which it has inherited and the historical review

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,640
of Riosucio is its tradition.

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,440
What do you do here in the municipality of Riosucio, Choco?

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,760
Well, in the municipality of Riosucio ... I was displaced since 1997.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,400
From then I engaged in social work. Since before I was displaced, I worked in social work

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,360
because I was a foster mother of my community and came here as a foster mother

17
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,760
and then I retired from being a foster mother to work in social work

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,360
social work with displaced women and not displaced women, but I have always worked for people.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,640
Zenaida, I would love if you could explain to us what forced displacement is?

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,830
Well forced displacement is when you are in your territory and people acting on the margins

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,760
of the law (outlaws) create conflict, and you have to move

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,520
some are killed, and others have a chance to run.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
So a forced displacement

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,240
is just that. It was not in my plan for
move from my home

25
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,380
so for that reason we are still being exiled by that forced displacement

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:04,070
that happened in 97, from 95 to 97, it was very harsh and the displacement continues

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,680
exhaustive mass displacement.

28
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,360
What is a victim? What does it mean to be a victim of the armed conflict?

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,960
Well, a person is a victim of armed conflict not only because someone has been murdered.

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:24,560
There are eight classes of victim: forced displacement;

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:34,000
kidnapping; death; forced disappearance; forced recruitment;

32
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,011
minors.

33
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,120
All that, all that is becoming a victim of armed conflict

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,100
because all that comes from the influence within the disputed territory

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,420
a territory that belongs to us but they

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
are surrounding.

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,040
What are the main problems you have in the municipality of Riosucio, Choco?

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,600
And what has caused more - generated more problems here in the municipality?

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,720
Well, I think the problem we can not ignore is the displacement

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,209
Riosucio is a receptor municipality of all communities who have been displaced

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:14,400
from their territories. And the other main  problem at the moment:

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,120
the issue of landmines, which are affecting all of the

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,000
territory of Bajo Atrato.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,600
We also desplaza--we have

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:34,160
a harsh trend of youth gangs through the people who use drugs, drug addiction

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,560
and that also begun through displacement and armed conflict.

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,320
All this has led to people being forcibly displaced

48
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,400
without understanding how to live or how to reach the municipality.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,049
In 97, people were forcibly displaced in a "massive" forced displacement, as we say

50
00:03:54,049 --> 00:04:00,500
but before that,  in '94, '95, '96, many people had already been displaced. People who

51
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,599
had been threatened and have had to leave their territory, but the massive one was in '97.

52
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,400
Where was that?

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,760
Throughout Bajo Atrato, throughout Bajo Atrato people were displaced: Salaquí; Truandó;

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,200
La Larga; Pedegiuta; Carmen del Darién. Everything, all of Bajo Atrato.

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,279
We thought we were going to live in peace

56
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,800
but I think right now we are suffering the same problems

57
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,240
forced displacement, not being able to go in either direction

58
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,080
because the persecutions of different armed groups.

59
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,320
I think we are alive and we can speak up more

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,080
that we have not adapted is another thing but do not want -- we are not in

61
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,440
our home with the things that we need.

62
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:51,110
But as I understand, Zenaida, this year, in March this year there was a

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,200
displacement here in the municipality of
Riosucio, Chocó in the Truandó basin. Is that true?

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,720
Yes, that's true. I spoke of landmines for that reason fellow people

65
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,220
from Rio Truandó were displaced because the territory is mined. So that's why we say to us as

66
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,199
an organisation, the situation is more serious than last time. We can say that because last time

67
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,720
before, you could run, you could walk
through the territory but now people can not move

68
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,160
within the territory because there are landmines sown

69
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,120
and they have killed many.

70
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
[What does it mean to be young in the midst of armed conflict?]

71
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,840
[Umberto?] Moreno Cuesta and I live in the municipality of Riosucio.

72
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,400
I belong to the basin [community] of Truandó

73
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,760
I think we young people in the armed conflict employ a very important role

74
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,640
for the simple reason of being
young people

75
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,280
and I think since the '97

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,440
that really was *the* displacement here in our municipality, we were presented with many things.

77
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:07,849
many young things took up arms
many young people at this time right now

78
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,320
that took that issue [of pop-- 
seething, disagreeing]

79
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,320
I think there are young people who have returned to civilian life or at this point you have

80
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:26,830
said "no more war" and most
It is important that young people can

81
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,449
play and take the time and
really this war that has caused us

82
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:38,300
so much harm to us as young people
we can be enjoy that we have the

83
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,520
freedom of moving somewhere where really fear doesn't represent a threat.

84
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,980
Being young means consuming peace

85
00:06:48,980 --> 00:07:00,560
have a freedom to express what one feels, accomplish opportunities wherever we are

86
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,600
and that the young person can really take advantage of all opportunities that are available

87
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,000
whether on an national or international level.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,040
As I say the first displacement

89
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:19,979
that hit me and that I was aware of and carry, so to speak

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,440
Was the displacement '96-'97 was the shift in where, fortunately, if I can use that word

91
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,229
I was able to escape the wolf's mouth. There were many clashes between

92
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:44,430
between the state security forces and armed groups outside the law

93
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:52,560
what was then FARC and paramilitaries but that scenario...I lived in a nightmare

94
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,560
We were displaced with our
family for the municipality Turbo

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,520
hoping that the war would end.

96
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,060
I think living in that displacement...I don't know

97
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,920
for me, I do not wish it on anyone because we lived something inhumane where

98
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,480
We had friends that the FARC took and some were recruited

99
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:24,240
some were useful to FARC and served at the frontlines or if they weren't useful to FARC, they were killed.

100
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,900
For me, to live through this displacement and everything my parents told me about it

101
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,549
that I had forgotten was something I would not wish on anyone.

102
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:44,950
I think ... in my 29 years, everything that happened in the municipality Riosucio, my community

103
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,529
has led to a bittersweet moment because there comes a time we are within our community but

104
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,120
displacement continues, even right now.

105
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,800
For me, as a young person, that lasting stability first begins when there

106
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,490
is a countryside without life, there needs to be a countryside where we can sow and harvest freely

107
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,440
where there really is opportunity and that nothing

108
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,920
holds us back like what is happening to us right now

109
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,520
like what is in the countryside, illegal groups and I think

110
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,120
that as young people we are experiencing anxiety because if

111
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,600
there really is no chance to reap freely within your community

112
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,120
as there is opportunity for us to say we will not go to war

113
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:37,430
because I can not speak a
peace process if there is really no

114
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:43,450
peace where where where poor people--
us small farmers

115
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:48,800
cultivate the field because as the saying goes, without the country there's no city

116
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,160
if we do not sow anything, the rich cannot eat, because they eat

117
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,820
what we grow. I think I need as a young person, a field within this displacement

118
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,990
of what we have experienced we need a free countryside where there are [sheaves]

119
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,510
where there is transparency and honesty where there is no [waste?] but opportunity

120
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,360
for the farmer and for us.

121
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:21,520
Good morning, my name is Chidi Valencia [...] from the community of [Venecia] and now

122
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm going to sing a song called

123
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,920
Supe Que Me Amaba

124
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:39,360
From the beginning when I needed you

125
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,800
From the moment when the look lifted

126
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:52,960
Since that day when you found me alone

127
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:06,000
When your gaze landed on me
I knew you loved me I understood,

128
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:19,360
And I knew you were looking over me
I waited a long time and I did not, no, no

129
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,800
I knew you loved me, although I fled

130
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,280
I went far from your house

131
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:43,280
And with a kiss and love
You gave me your mercy, I'm here

132
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:49,280
And when I was away, I felt

133
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:57,120
I knew that you take care of me, and i heard you

134
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,800
Your voice in the silence was like a whisper

135
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,340
Every day brought me to you

136
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:23,600
I knew you loved me, I understood
I knew you were looking over me

137
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,400
Although you waited a long time for me and I did not arrive, no, no

138
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:43,680
I knew you loved me, although I fled
I went far from your house

139
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,880
And with a kiss and love
You gave me you forgiveness

140
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,960
I'm here

141
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:59,600
And I'm here My Sweet Lord

142
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,640
I'm here my dear Savior

143
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I'm here

144
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,160
I'm here.

145
00:13:19,840 --> 00:00:00,000
Here we find the talents of
our young people in the municipality of Riosucio, Chocó.
