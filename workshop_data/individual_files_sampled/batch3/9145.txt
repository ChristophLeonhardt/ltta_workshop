GOVERNOR WHO IS JUST INAUGURATED LAST YEAR FINALLY COMES TO A CLOSE THIS EVENING. Bret: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MATT. TWO ARE OTHER TOP STORY, ABC HAS CANCELED ROSEANNE BARR’S TV SHOW. THAT COMES FOLLOWING A TWEET FROM A COMIC WHICH MOST PEOPLE FOUND NOT FUNNY AT ALL BUT RATHER OF ABHORRENT. ROSEANNE BARR WAS ON TOP OF THE WORLD. HER RESURRECTED SHOW WAS A HUGE CHECK FOR ABC.

ABC ACTED WITH STUNNING SWIFTNESS TO PROTECT ITS BRAND ALTHOUGH THE SHOW HAD BEEN VERY LUCRATIVE. IN THIS HYPER POLARIZED TWITTER ERA, A NETWORK’S REPUTATION CAN BE TARNISHED AND A TOP STAR KENDA STRIPPED DESTRUCT.
