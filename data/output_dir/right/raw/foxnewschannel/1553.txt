1
00:00:29,215 --> 00:00:31,384
>> WELL, I THINK I MAKE A BETTER

2
00:00:31,384 --> 00:00:34,754
SENATOR THAN THE OTHER TWO

3
00:00:34,754 --> 00:00:37,923
CANDIDATES AND I THINK I CAN

4
00:00:37,923 --> 00:00:38,224
WIN.

5
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,492
>> Neil: SO WHEN YOU HEAD

6
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,776
PATRICK

7
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:41,427
PATRIC

8
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:44,430
PATRICK MORRISEY SAY THAT YOU

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,032
COULD CONTINUE THE REPUBLICANS

10
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:47,233
THIS SENATE SEEK PICK UP, YOU

11
00:00:47,233 --> 00:00:47,967
SAY WHAT?

12
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:49,468
>> I SAY NUMBER 1, THAT WHEN I

13
00:00:49,468 --> 00:00:51,203
WAS RUNNING IN THE PRIMARY, THEY

14
00:00:51,203 --> 00:00:53,539
SAID I WAS RUNNING SOLELY TO BE

15
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:54,607
VENGEFUL AGAINST SENATOR

16
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:54,940
MANCHIN.

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,810
NOW THEY'RE SAYING I'M RUNNING

18
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,613
TO CAUSE SENATOR MANCHIN TO WIN.

19
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:01,981
I'M RUNNING TO WIN.

20
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:03,649
>> Neil: YOU MUST KNOW YOU HAVE

21
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,184
BETTER ODDS OF TAKING VOTES AWAY

22
00:01:05,184 --> 00:01:06,585
FROM THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE

23
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:10,022
THAN THE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT,

24
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:10,389
RIGHT?

25
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:13,626
>> NOT 100% SURE OF THAT.

26
00:01:13,626 --> 00:01:15,695
THE DEMOCRATS ARE VERY FED UP

27
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:16,996
WITH SENATOR MANCHIN AND THERE'S

28
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:19,332
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS THAT ARE IN

29
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:21,567
SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA IN THE

30
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:22,601
MINING FIELDS WHERE I'M KNOWN

31
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:23,869
AND RESPECTED.

32
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,272
>> Neil: SO HAVING PLACED THIRD,

33
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,440
DO YOU THINK IN THAT RIGHT THAT

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,442
YOU COULD HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT

35
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:30,276
IN THIS ONE?

36
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:33,245
EVEN IF YOU WERE ALLOWED TO RUN

37
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:35,748
AS A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE.

38
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,550
>> I'M PRETTY COMFORTABLE I'M BE

39
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,384
ALLOWED TO RUN.

40
00:01:38,384 --> 00:01:41,520
THE LAW IS CLEAR ON THAT.

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,290
100% CHANCE IF IT'S DECIDED

42
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,325
BASED ON THE LAW.

43
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:47,793
>> Neil: THERE'S A SORE LOSER

44
00:01:47,793 --> 00:01:50,062
FEATURE AND YOU WOULD BE DEEMED

45
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:52,732
A SORE LOSER, YOU'D SAY THAT IS

46
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:53,032
WRONG?

47
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:56,102
>> MY ATTORNEYS TELL ME THAT IS

48
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:56,469
WRONG.

49
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:57,370
WE'LL FIND OUT.

50
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,105
BASED ON THE LAW, I'M CONFIDENT

51
00:01:59,105 --> 00:02:03,776
WE'LL BE ON THE BALLOT AND IF WE

52
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:06,879
ARE WE HAVE A CHANCE OF WINNING

53
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,214
BECAUSE OF THEIR FLAWED PAST.

54
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:09,982
>> Neil: HAS THE ATTORNEY

55
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:10,816
GENERAL REACHED OUT TO YOU OR

56
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:17,690
YOU TO HE AFTER THE PRIMARY?

57
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,759
>> NO, I'VE NOT TALKED TO HIM.

58
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,794
I TALKED TO HIM AFTER THE DEBATE

59
00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:23,129
ON FOX BUT I'M NOT SURE.

60
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:24,563
I MAY HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM ONE

61
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:25,431
MORE TIME AFTER THAT.

62
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:28,200
>> Neil: HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO

63
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,435
SENATOR MANCHIN?

64
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:31,737
>> NO, I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO

65
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:33,305
SENATOR MANCHIN IN SEVEN OR

66
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:33,973
EIGHT YEARS.

67
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:35,708
SENATOR MANCHIN, IF YOU RECALL,

68
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,877
SAID I HAD BLOOD ON MY HANDS

69
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:39,178
AFTER THE EXPLOSION.

70
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:40,379
OF COURSE, IT'S OF GREAT

71
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:41,447
INTEREST TO HEAR THIS TALK ABOUT

72
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,115
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND

73
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:44,450
BEING SO CORRUPT AND ALL OF

74
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,352
THESE ISSUES THAT THEY HAD.

75
00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:47,553
IT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

76
00:02:47,553 --> 00:02:49,388
THAT INDICTED ME ON THREE

77
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:50,790
FELONIES BUT COULDN'T CONVICT ME

78
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,892
ON ANY.

79
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:55,528
IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT THE NEWS

80
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,062
MEDIA AND THIS NETWORK AS WELL

81
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:58,764
CONTINUES TO TELL PEOPLE I'M A

82
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:00,666
FELON WHICH'S NEVER BEEN

83
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,801
CONVICTED OF A FELONY.

84
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:03,669
I'M LESS LIKELY TO BE A FELON

85
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:05,604
THAN ANYONE GIVEN THAT I WAS

86
00:03:05,604 --> 00:03:06,772
INVESTIGATED FOR 4 1/2 YEARS AND

87
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:07,740
THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

88
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,709
>> Neil: SO WHAT ARE YOU IF YOU

89
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,312
SERVED TIME IN JAIL?

90
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:17,850
>> A MISS

91
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:17,883
>> A MISDE

92
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:17,917
>> A MISDEME

93
00:03:17,917 --> 00:03:17,950
>> A MISDEMEAN

94
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:17,983
>> A MISDEMEANOR

95
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:18,217
>> A MISDEMEANOR.

96
00:03:18,217 --> 00:03:20,519
THE ONLY ONE TO SERVE TIME IN

97
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:20,920
CALIFORNIA.

98
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,556
THAT SHOULD TELL US SOMETHING AS

99
00:03:23,556 --> 00:03:26,592
WHEN WHEN THEY'RE SENDING

100
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,460
MISDEMEANORS TO PRISON WHEN THEY

101
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,127
CAN'T COMMUNICATE.

102
00:03:28,127 --> 00:03:29,395
IT'S PRETTY TELLING.

103
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:31,030
>> Neil: THERE ARE THOSE THAT

104
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,098
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT.

105
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:34,834
THEY'RE SAYING IT'S BIGGER THAN

106
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:38,604
A MISDEMEANOR WHEN 29 PEOPLE ARE

107
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:40,039
2010 FOR WHICH YOU OR YOUR

108
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,841
COMPANY WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

109
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:43,042
VIOLATING SAFETY STANDARDS AND

110
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:43,642
THE REST.

111
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,144
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT AND

112
00:03:45,144 --> 00:03:46,512
OBVIOUSLY YOU FELT THAT WAY

113
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:46,912
AFTERWARDS.

114
00:03:46,912 --> 00:03:52,284
THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN A

115
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:53,185
MISDEMEANOR, RIGHT?

116
00:03:53,185 --> 00:03:55,754
>> IF YOU STRETCH IT THAT FAR.

117
00:03:55,754 --> 00:03:59,058
THE GOVERNMENT BLEW UP THE COAL

118
00:03:59,058 --> 00:03:59,525
MINES.

119
00:03:59,525 --> 00:04:00,626
THE GOVERNMENT WANTED TO COVER

120
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:02,695
WHAT HAPPENED --

121
00:04:02,695 --> 00:04:04,296
>> Neil: DID YOU VIOLATE SAFETY

122
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:04,663
STANDARDS?

123
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,465
THAT YOU VIOLATED SAFETY

124
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:08,100
STANDARDS AND THAT'S WHAT

125
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,036
PROMPTED ALL OF THIS AND YOU TO

126
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:11,937
GO TO JAIL?

127
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:14,173
>> NO, I'VE NEVER VIOLATED A

128
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:15,774
SAFETY STANDARD MYSELF.

129
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,644
COAL COMPANIES HAVE LOTS OF

130
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:19,043
VIOLATIONS.

131
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:20,079
THIS MINE WAS AVERAGE.

132
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,281
IT HAD LESS THAN ONE VIOLATION

133
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:25,251
PER INSPECTOR A DAY OVER 2 1/2

134
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:25,551
YEARS.

135
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:27,953
BOTH THE MEDIA AND THE

136
00:04:27,953 --> 00:04:31,190
GOVERNMENT MADE IT OUT IT WAS AN

137
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:31,891
EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER.

138
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:33,826
IT WAS 20% LESS THAN THE MINE

139
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:35,895
NEXT DOOR AND 20% MORE AFTER I

140
00:04:35,895 --> 00:04:36,562
LEFT THE COMPANY.

141
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:38,497
IS SO IT'S AN EASY STORY FOR THE

142
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:39,765
MEDIA AND THE GOVERNMENT TO

143
00:04:39,765 --> 00:04:42,468
TELL, BUT IT'S UNTRUE.

144
00:04:42,468 --> 00:04:44,370
>> MR. BLANKENSHIP, I'M

145
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,639
WONDERING NOW, IF YOU PURSUE

146
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,374
THIS, OBVIOUSLY YOU'D RAISE CAN

147
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:49,275
UNDERSTAND AMONG SENATE

148
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:50,376
REPUBLICANS THAT THIS IS A

149
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,511
POTENTIAL PICKUP FOR THEM

150
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,646
INCLUDING MITCH McCONNELL THAT

151
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,014
HOPED THAT YOU WOULD LOSE AND HE

152
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:59,001
HAD HIS WITCH

153
00:04:59,184 --> 00:04:59,218
HAD HIS WISH

154
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:00,386
HAD HIS WISH,

155
00:05:00,386 --> 00:05:00,419
HAD HIS WISH, I

00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:00,452
HAD HIS WISH, I T

HAD HIS WISH, I THINK

HAD HIS WISH, I THINK H

00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:00,886
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK HE

HAD HIS WISH, I THINK HE SEN

164
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:01,220
HAD HIS WISH, I THINK HE SENT

165
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,594
YOU A SNARKY REMINDER AFTER

166
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:08,928
THAT.

167
00:05:08,928 --> 00:05:10,596
IS THIS ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL?

168
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:11,196
>> NO.

169
00:05:11,196 --> 00:05:12,598
IT'S ABOUT THE ESTABLISHMENT --

170
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:13,599
>> Neil: WHO IS THE

171
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,033
ESTABLISHMENT?

172
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:15,267
>> IT'S BOTH THE REPUBLICANS AND

173
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,468
THE DEMOCRATS.

174
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:19,638
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A SITUATION

175
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:25,377
WHERE THEY ARE MORE RESPONSIBLE

176
00:05:25,377 --> 00:05:26,478
FOR THE PARTIES.

177
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:27,413
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STAND UP

178
00:05:27,413 --> 00:05:31,283
AGAINST THEM.

179
00:05:31,283 --> 00:05:34,019
I'VE BEEN SO ABUSED BY THE

180
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,588
GOVERNMENT AND SENT TO PRISON AS

181
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:38,324
A MISDEMEANOR, I'M VERY

182
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,224
MOTIVATED TO STAND UP AGAINST

183
00:05:39,224 --> 00:05:40,159
THIS NONSENSE.

184
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,727
>> Neil: A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU

185
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:42,695
WERE THE ESTABLISHMENT.

186
00:05:42,695 --> 00:05:44,863
YOU WERE RUNNING FOR THE

187
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:46,098
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.

188
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:47,399
>> I'M SORRY?

189
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,601
>> Neil: A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, YOU

190
00:05:48,601 --> 00:05:49,568
WERE THE ESTABLISHMENT.

191
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:50,869
YOU WERE RUNNING FOR THE

192
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:51,837
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION.

193
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:53,138
NOW IT SEEMS AFTER FAILING TO

194
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:54,940
GET IT, PLACING THIRD, YOU'RE

195
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,375
BITTER AND ANGRY AND NOW YOU'RE

196
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:57,810
NOT ESTABLISHMENT AND YOU'RE

197
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,980
RUNNING APART FROM THOSE

198
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,513
PARTIES, RIGHT?

199
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:02,848
>> Neil: AGAIN, YOU CAN SAY

200
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:03,182
THAT.

201
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:04,149
IT'S NOT TRUE.

202
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:06,352
I RAN ON THE PLATFORM OF NOT

203
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:07,586
VOTING FOR MITCH McCONNELL AND

204
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,455
ON THE PLATFORM OF BALANCING THE

205
00:06:09,455 --> 00:06:12,958
BUDGET AND ON THE PLATFORM OF

206
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,127
STOPPING THE EFFORTS TO POLICE

207
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:18,197
THE WORLD, WHICH WEST VIRGINIANS

208
00:06:18,197 --> 00:06:19,832
TO BELIEVE IN.

209
00:06:19,832 --> 00:06:21,900
>> Neil: DIDN'T THEY VOTE

210
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:28,474
ACCORDINGLY AND SAY WHATEVER THE

211
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:28,807
MERITS.

212
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,275
>> THEY DIDN'T RUN ON THE FACTS.

213
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,877
THEY RAN ON WHAT FOX NEWS AND

214
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:35,247
OTHERS WERE SAYING THAT I WAS A

215
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:37,182
FELON, INCLUDING PRESIDENT

216
00:06:37,182 --> 00:06:38,150
TRUMP'S SON --

217
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,885
>> Neil: I'M JUST SAYING THAT --

218
00:06:39,885 --> 00:06:45,958
TO BE CLEAR, ARE YOU SAYING THAT

219
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,926
RESIDENTS AND VOTERS THAT OPTED

220
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:51,063
FOR TWO OTHER CANDIDATES OVER

221
00:06:51,063 --> 00:06:52,765
YOU WERE DOOPED?

222
00:06:52,765 --> 00:06:56,402
>> YES, I'M SAYING THEY WERE

223
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:59,104
MISLED BY THE PRESIDENT'S SON TO

224
00:06:59,104 --> 00:07:01,240
SIX OR SEVEN SEPARATORS TO THE

225
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,042
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A

226
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:04,376
WHOLE HOST OF OTHER PEOPLE.

227
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:06,745
BECAUSE EVERYONE JOINED IN TO

228
00:07:06,745 --> 00:07:07,913
THIS LIE ABOUT MY HAVING

229
00:07:07,913 --> 00:07:09,815
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE

230
00:07:09,815 --> 00:07:10,215
EXPLOSION.

231
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:11,884
I WAS NEVER EVEN TRIED FOR

232
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:14,687
ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE

233
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,054
EXPLOSION.

234
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:17,322
AND PRESIDENT OBAMA CLAIMS THAT

235
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:19,558
HE KNEW WHAT HAPPENED AT THE

236
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:22,127
COAL MAN BEFORE ANYBODY WENT

237
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:22,561
UNDERGROUND.

238
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:23,729
>> Neil: I'M SORRY, SIR.

239
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:25,764
BUT WOULD YOU DO -- IF THE STATE

240
00:07:25,764 --> 00:07:27,533
SAID YOU CAN'T DO THIS, WE HAVE

241
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,034
THIS LAW IN EFFECT, YOUR LAWYER

242
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,669
SEEMED TO BE TELLING YOU NO, YOU

243
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:32,371
CAN GET ON THE BALLOT ANYWAY AS

244
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:34,139
A WRITE IN.

245
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,008
IS THAT THE LAST -- THE LAST

246
00:07:36,008 --> 00:07:39,078
STRATEGY, YOU CAN USE AS A WRITE

247
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:39,845
IN CANDIDATE?

248
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:40,612
>> I COULD.

249
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:42,047
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO.

250
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:44,450
THE LAW -- THEY WROTE ANOTHER

251
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,985
LAW JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO

252
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:49,655
THAT TAKES EFFECT IN JUNE TRYING

253
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:52,257
TO CLARIFY THEIR SORE LOSER LAW.

254
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,493
THEY OBVIOUSLY WEREN'T

255
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,528
COMFORTABLE WITH THE SORE LOSER

256
00:07:56,528 --> 00:07:57,196
LAW --

257
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:59,098
>> Neil: SO YOU'RE NOT A SORE,

258
00:07:59,098 --> 00:07:59,998
BITTER LOSER?

259
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:00,532
>> NO.

260
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:02,901
I'M A LITTLE BIT BITTER AT THE

261
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,369
FACT THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO

262
00:08:04,369 --> 00:08:05,871
REPORT THAT I'M A FELON AND

263
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:06,939
CONTINUE TO CLAIM SOMETHING THAT

264
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:09,408
IS OBVIOUSLY FALSE.

265
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,745
I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I-75

266
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:14,980
FROM LAURA INGLE AND JUDGE

267
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,016
NAPOLITANO HAVE TO STOP THAT.

268
00:08:18,016 --> 00:08:19,718
>> Neil: WE CAN GO AROUND AND

269
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:21,487
AROUND ON THIS, SIR.

270
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:22,121
I UNDERSTAND.

271
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,889
WE CAN GO AROUND ON THIS.

272
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,324
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU ARE HELL

273
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:27,593
BENT ON GETTING ON THAT BALLOT

274
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,162
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH

275
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,597
THE STATE SAYS YOU CAN'T?

276
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,999
>> THE STATE HASN'T SAID WE

277
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:34,299
CAN'T.

278
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,235
THE STATE HASN'T DECIDED THAT

279
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:36,534
YET.

280
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:39,004
WHEN WE FINALLY FILED THE PAPERS

281
00:08:39,004 --> 00:00:00,000
TO BE ON THE BALLOT --
