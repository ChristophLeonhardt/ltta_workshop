00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so one of the pretty common</font>

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,570
questions that I'm asked in emails and

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,819
things like that is what where do you

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,140
get your books from how do you pick the

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,280
books that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to review</font>

6
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,960
generally a lot of them just<font color="#E5E5E5"> come from</font>

7
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,150
wandering round book shops and seeing

8
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,160
what I like and chatting to staff and

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,079
asking for recommendations and sometimes

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,190
I'll have read a review from someone

11
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,050
that I really trust as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> additionally</font>

12
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,400
through video blogging and things like

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,439
that publishers often send me books and

14
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,330
they'll email me and ask me whether I

15
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,920
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check out a certain book and I</font>

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,869
say yes no maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

17
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,130
to me that I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of taking</font>

18
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,869
absolutely everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I really pick</font>

19
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,729
books that I think sound interesting and

20
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,710
there's scenarios when publishers

21
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,480
approach you but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> another Avenue</font>

22
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,219
and that's the blog of branch or blogger

23
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:40,200
events<font color="#E5E5E5"> braga evenings</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of stuff</font>

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:51,480
points as handouts all that stuff at

34
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,359
actually read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all in one day because</font>

35
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,949
I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had so much fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

36
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,339
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> delicious fun yummy but it would</font>

37
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:06,600
fall into the young adult category

38
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,549
multiple narratives lots of rising

39
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,110
action and centers around these

40
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,570
teenagers who inadvertently become the

41
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,909
sole survivors of an alien<font color="#E5E5E5"> invasion</font>

42
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,979
attack thing they're all attendees at a

43
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,650
house party but because of certain

44
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,180
circumstances around their relationships

45
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,229
they end up being a situation that

46
00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:27,020
allows them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the only survivors</font>

47
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,159
this is really roundabout way of saying

48
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,960
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to spoil this for you it</font>

49
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't a lot of ways very breakfast club</font>

50
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">e like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people from different social</font>

51
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,750
groups you don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

52
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">friends have to work together in this</font>

53
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">really emergency situation what I</font>

54
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:42,270
particularly love is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

55
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,189
conscious of that genre and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

56
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,659
makes a reference to breakfast club and

57
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,030
it references all those similar types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

58
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,220
films and bonding experiences it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like breakfast club but zombieland</font>

60
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">breakfast club and the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I</font>

61
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,990
would say is that even though it is

62
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,820
quite a light region certainly a fun

63
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,259
read the characters are a lot more

64
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,729
complex than you think definitely

65
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,990
characters who would be easy to like

66
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">cast of a stereotypical and all that</font>

67
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,520
stuff but<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that wonderful wonderful</font>

68
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,890
characters great and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> particularly like</font>

69
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,479
the two young woman in it because I felt

70
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">like they really are though so cool I</font>

71
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,380
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be them I would</font>

74
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,920
it has this amazing cover which fun fact

75
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,890
this isn't like graphics or anything

76
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,140
these are actual lights that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

77
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,820
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a photographer took</font>

pictures of them and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> lights and</font>

79
