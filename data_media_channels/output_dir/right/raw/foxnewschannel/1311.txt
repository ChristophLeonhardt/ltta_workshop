ARE THERE TAPES?

12
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,355
HAS HE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT

13
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:14,923
AUDIOTAPES AND IS THE

>> YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T

16
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:17,825
SPOKEN TO MICHAEL ABOUT IT.

17
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:19,761
WHAT WE DO KNOW NOW IS THAT

18
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:21,029
ATTORNEY AVENATTI HAS ONE

19
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,197
THING AND ONE THING ONLY HE

20
00:00:23,197 --> 00:00:24,465
WANTS TO DO WHICH IS

21
00:00:24,465 --> 00:00:24,932
SELF-PROMOTION.

22
00:00:24,932 --> 00:00:25,600
HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO

23
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,868
JOIN THIS CASE AND THE JUDGE

24
00:00:26,868 --> 00:00:28,036
SAID EITHER YOU CAN JOIN THE

25
00:00:28,036 --> 00:00:28,970
CASE AND BE QUIET OR

26
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:30,505
CONTINUE TO GO ON TELEVISION

27
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:31,439
AND PROMOTE YOURSELF AND

28
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,341
THIS IS A MAN, I THINK IT

29
00:00:33,341 --> 00:00:35,276

30
00:00:35,276 --> 00:00:36,577
$10 MILLION HIMSELF AVENATTI

00:00:36,577 --> 00:00:36,877

32
00:00:36,877 --> 00:00:38,279
HIS GOAL IS TO GO OUT AND

33
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,548
GET AS MUCH FREE PUBLICITY

34
00:00:40,548 --> 00:00:42,083
AS HE CAN BY HIMSELF AND NOT

35
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,485
SEE ANY JUSTICE PERFORMED

36
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:44,885
HERE.

37
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:45,786
>> Martha: REPORTS WERE THAT

38
00:00:45,786 --> 00:00:46,921
THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY UPSET

39
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,556
WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT THIS

40
00:00:48,556 --> 00:00:49,657

41
00:00:49,657 --> 00:00:51,292
ONE MORE TIME, ARE THERE

00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:52,226
TAPES AND IS THE PRESIDENT

43
00:00:52,226 --> 00:00:52,660
ON THEM?

44
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:53,628
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE

45
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:54,261
TAPES AND I DON'T KNOW IF

46
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:55,863
THE PRESIDENT IS ON THEM.

47
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:56,897
LOOK, YOU HAVE TO THINK IN

48
00:00:56,897 --> 00:00:57,999

THIS IS UNPARALLEL DOLLARS UNUNT

58
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:06,674
THE PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL

59
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:08,042
ATTORNEY IS RAIDED WHILE HE

60
00:01:08,042 --> 00:01:08,876
IS SITTING IN OFFICE.

61
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:09,910
CAN YOU IMAGINE FOR ONE

62
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,811
SECOND IF IT WAS PRESIDENT

63
00:01:10,811 --> 00:01:12,013
OBAMA AND THE JUSTICE

00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:13,581
DEPARTMENT RAIDED HIS OWN

65
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:14,115
PERSONAL ATTORNEY?

66
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,183
THE MEDIA WOULD BE IN AN

67
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:17,752
UPROAR AND HAS BEEN VERY

68
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:18,486
LIMITED UPROAR.

69
00:01:18,486 --> 00:01:20,354
THERE IS A SERIOUS CONCERN

70
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:22,923
HERE ABOUT ATTORNEY-CLIENT

71
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:23,290
PRIVILEGE.

72
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,058
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT AT

73
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:25,660
ONE PERIOD OF TIME MICHAEL

74
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:26,794
COHEN WAS THE PRESIDENT'S

75
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:27,762
ATTORNEY AND THE

76
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,096
CONVERSATIONS HE HAD WERE

77
00:01:29,096 --> 00:01:30,264
WITH THE PRESIDENT AND ARE

78
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:31,932
PART OF THAT ATTORNEY-CLIENT

79
00:01:31,932 --> 00:01:32,299
PRIVILEGE.

80
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:33,501
WHICH MICHAEL CANNOT REVEAL.

81
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,669
THAT IS UP TO THE CLIENT TO

82
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:36,003
REVEAL.

83
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:36,670
AND DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT

84
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,072
TRUMP WAS THE CLIENT.

85
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:38,839
>> Martha: IF THAT'S THE

86
00:01:38,839 --> 00:00:00,000
CASE, THERE WILL BE A BATTLE
