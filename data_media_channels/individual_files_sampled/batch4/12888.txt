Mark Zuckerberg says he shocked that a business he built around stealing your personal data while you were chatting with your friends has been stealing your personal data while you were chatting with your friends sukh says he's going to solve this problem by personally investigating every app on facebook he doesn't like and the government is going to get involved as well so what could possibly go wrong we are 45 minutes away from the Clavin this weekend but don't worry I have a parachute and I'm going to get help trigger warning and this is the Andrew all right that was Beckett yeah it was too cute to use only once and I feel I'm pretty cute too so I thought we just mix those together we are approaching the Clavin this weekend now but don't worry former Vice President Joe Biden on Tuesday told an audience at the University of Miami about talking about Trump he said a guy who ended up becoming our national leader said I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it they asked me if I'd like to debate this gentleman and I said no I said if we were in high school I take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him so Donald Trump answered in a tweet crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault he doesn't know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way don't threaten people Joe so our national dialogue remains at a high level and meanwhile the Congress is about to sign a 1.3 trillion dollar spending bill and nobody knows what's in it so there's gonna be a great clayvin this weekend for everybody we have the Hudson Institute's Mike Duran here he wrote this and fantastic timeline basically a really dense long article for National Review making

genius.com it's an easy way to compare and buy life insurance so you know I've talked before about how I got into this business you know I'm a novelist I've been in novelist all my life I worked in Hollywood by accident they kind of dragged me into the movie business and I made some money doing it so I kept doing it but mostly I write stories I've written stories all my life but there came a point when I became over loudmouth about politics as a certain point in your life politics become very important to you the real world becomes very important to you you're worried about your kids and you're worried about the future and I started to talk about that and that kind of damaged my Hollywood career and I also found that I really liked hanging out with conservatives because they were smarter than left us and they were smarter than a lot of people who do the kind of work I do and I so I really enjoyed it and I found that as I was hanging out at these parties I kept running into Roger Simon and Roger Simon his fuck you because he is a former mystery writer a crime writer that's what I am a crime writer crime novel writer and a screenwriter and that's what I've been a screenwriter with a shaved head so it's kind of like an ease about ten I think he's about thirty years older than I am but he says he's about ten years older than I'm so it's kind of like bumping into myself you know Andy kept saying you know I'm building this is funny way of talking MacGyver in New York we're talking says I'm building this site top PJTV PJTV you know you want to come by and I kept running into him and finally I went in and looked at PJTV and I saw bill Whittle and I thought of Whittle can do this I was just sending my dog to do this and I got into this my first video was called shut up and it was I think it actually made a big change in the way people did political videos I actually think it had an effect certainly on PJTV because everybody shortened their videos made them a little more satirical a little funnier and my point was just that the only argument the left ever makes is shut up and they do it in a million different ways they call you racist they call you sexist they call you it you know a fascist and you're worse than Hitler whatever it is it's just another way of saying shut out and interestingly at the time Obama had just been president for a while and I was picking on him from going cowing to all these tyrants remember he was bowing to all those sheiks and everything and and also for spending a lot of money so now everybody's complaining the Trump is doing that everybody on the Left is complaining the Trump congratulated Putin on his fake election victory and they're saying oh he's kowtow he to tyrants of course if they sign him it's 1.3 I can't believe they're talking about this is a 2,200 page spending bill and nobody knows what's in it everybody's complaining about what's in it but nobody knows what's in it all I know is the Chuck Schumer looks happy so it's not good you know but the argument that all they ever do is tell us to shut up remains exactly true and now we have this Mark Zuckerberg story I a psychologist or a psychiatrist I can't remember which it was went on Facebook put on an app that had a personality test and then shared that information which with Cambridge analytic which used it for political purposes they don't like the political purposes so now this stuff that Obama was doing basically data mining is suddenly a problem everybody's calling everybody on the left especially is calling for an investigation and Zuckerberg went on TV and he says that he is going to take care of it do we have yeah that's just a cup not this was a major breach of trust and and I'm really sorry that this happened you know we have a basic responsibility to protect people's data and if we can't do that then we don't deserve to have the opportunity to serve people so our responsibility now is to make sure that this doesn't happen again and there are a few basic things that I think we need to do to ensure that one is making sure that developers like Alexander Cogan who got access to a lot of information and then I'm improperly used to just don't get access to as much information going forward so we are doing a set of things to to restrict the amount of access that that that developers can get going forward but the other is we need to make sure that there aren't any other Cambridge analyticals out there right or folks who have been properly accessed data so we're gonna go now and investigate every app that has access to a large amount of information from before we lock down our platform and if we detect any suspicious activity we're going to do a full forensic audit so this can't be good I mean it cannot be good a forensic audit by Mark Zuckerberg they're going to investigate any app that is suspicious to them we already know that by this trumpeting of fake news we already know that the left has infiltrated these sites because they are they're all very leftist all the people that are very leftist and it's infiltrated sites YouTube Google Twitter Facebook with these guys we're going to so-called you know they're gonna check for so-called fake news but they're all leftist the Southern Poverty Law Center PolitiFact Snopes these are all left-wing organizations very left-wing organizations and even Facebook's commitment to only trusting certain brands of news privileges essentially the mainstream news media which is now so far to the left that it's gone almost completely insane and and there's Mark Warner and other Democrats are calling for an investigation of Facebook and they want Zuckerberg to testify and Zuckerberg is saying yes we may need some regulation this is not a good scenario as far as I can because we know we always know what the leftist policy to free speech is here it is that basically is a policy statement from the left every Democrat voted to rewrite the First Amendment to give Congress the ability to determine what speech what political speech should be allowed here let me just give you a couple of examples of things that have just been happening very very recently that show you the this strain in our culture that is getting worse and worse YouTube is entering the gun control debate with a new ban on videos which demo firearms or link to websites selling firearms or firearm accessories so exactly YouTube is entering the gun control debate by stopping the gun control debate on YouTube right it is century the move to ban firearm demos drub tails with the media platforms desire to prohibit videos with instructions on how to assemble firearms of course guns built at home have not been part of any mass attacks or any you know one high school in New Jersey I mean just just keeping this thought in mind the silencing of concern of speech at one high school in New Jersey they suspended three kids for posting photos of their day shooting guns they suspended a kid in New Jersey for a gun a bumper sticker supporting guns his dad went into the school board talking to the school board they're like 200 parents they're applauding and it's it's a it's great that they're fighting back but just the idea that you could censor kids for what they are saying for their support of the Constitution off campus is absolutely insane so recently I'm gonna continue this in just a minute but recently I just you know we had this little incident here at the Daily wire where we the officers caught fire when one of our employees tried to make a thousand copies of his but on our Xerox machine and I thought to myself you know we probably should have used super Cruiser people here because if recruiter is the smarter way to hire employees and boy oh boy this place would be entirely different if we had used it zip recruiter learns what you're looking for it identifies the people with the right experience and it invites them to apply to your job and these invitations have revolutionized how you find the next hire 80% of employers who post a job on zip recruiter get a quality candidate through the site in just one day that's pretty amazing is it recruiter doesn't stop there that even spotlight the strongest applications you receive so you never miss a great match you don't look overlooked it the right candidates are out there zip recruiter is how you find them oh oh oh if we had only only only users zip recruiter it's the daily wire it would be an entirely different place and we would not being put be putting out that fire now right now my listeners can try zip recruiter for free which is pretty good discount free just go to zip recruiter comm slash daily wire that's zip recruiter comm slash daily wire zip recruiter comm slash daily wire every time you say daily wire you'll remember why you want to use zip recruiters the smartest way to hire here's another one last week a university here here's another thing that's happening is the silencing and the bullying of any speaker in favor of Israel the State of Israel last week a University of Virginia panel featuring Israeli military reservists was forcefully disrupted apparently violating multiple campus rules several days earlier at the University of California at Berkeley there was an anti-semitic death threat against a Jewish professor a week prior to that students wishing to hear the moderate Israeli former minister Dan Meridor at London's King's College were confronted with a menacing mob of screaming demonstrators at Princeton University in November the local Hillel chapter cancelled at the last minute a talk by Israelis Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister in response to pressure from pro-peace students you want to hear that maybe the greatest one just I won't keep doing this but an all-woman's college in Massachusetts is telling his teachers not to say women in the classroom but yeah exactly professors are instructed to say Mount Holyoke students instead of Mount Holyoke women and don't use the phrase we're all women here because people might discover you're all women there michael barone a Zygon article by the way women are the worst enemies of speech a poll of college students sponsored by the American Council on Education the Charles Koch foundation and the Stanton foundation ask students about free speech on campus whether it's allowed whether it should be this is from an article by michael barone majority majorities of students polled said they supported both free speech and inclusion and diversity when asked which was more important 53% said inclusion and diversity and only 46 percent said free speech so more people think inclusion and diversity is important than free speech which is insane but the difference between men and women was the striking thing among men 61% favoured free speech but only 35% of women favored free speech and and why why because feminism is dependent on a false narrative about men and women being the same when you were peddling a false narrative you've you know you've got to silence any narrative that is going to be post them because people hear a narrative this true immediately and they go oh yeah that's true that's obviously true so you've got a silence and you cannot peddle a false narrative while other people are peddling the truth you will lose that argument you know and we've talked about this before you remember a while back couple weeks ago is talking about a famous story about a little girl who was playing with matchsticks pretending one was the witch and one was Hansel and one was Gretel and suddenly ran to her father and was terrified and said take the witch away take the witch away because her play her imaginative play had become real to her and that this is what I feel is happening to our news media and to Democrats they have they have peddled this idea that Donald Trump is a Russian spy and Donald Trump is a tyrant and Donald Trump is in the most evil thing the end of democracy and now they believe it themselves I have this is this is amazing this is today's funniest two stories right which noise at News Buster's this site I love them I frequently bring in video from news Buster's I don't credit them enough but they're part of the media Research Center which noise has this policy thing he does called today in media bias history where he goes back in time and tells you how media bias this is from 2003 when the bombing of Baghdad started and here's how the New York Times reported it okay too many New Yorkers the scenes of Baghdad under siege were achingly familiar new New Yorkers watching the televised bombing of Baghdad yesterday said they were riveted by the raw and uninterrupted display of American military might but for some the bombing brought back particularly visceral and chilling memories they could not help thinking about September 11th and how New York too was once under assault from the skies so the bombing of Baghdad and the attack completely on you know attack on innocent people murdering 3,000 americans we're the same thing to the New York Times that was a complete correlation and this is the way they get themselves into this flurry so today let us visit the New York Times op-ed page or as we like to call it knucklehead roe so Thomas Friedman one of the chief knuckleheads on knucklehead row just to show that they're still making these invidious comparisons right he has what Trump and Putin have in common because everybody is so upset about Trump congratulating Putin on his victory and and I not sure I think that that's a great thing to do but obviously Trump just thought that he's the great deal maker he's the great communicator he's gonna work this out so Thomas Friedman writes first we said we heard how in 2003 the New York Times told us that the bombing of Baghdad was the same as 9/11 so now Thomas Friedman writes he tells a story about a bedouin chief and somebody steals his turkey and he cries to his sons boys help me find my turkey and they say well you know what do you need a turkey for but then people keep stealing for things from him and he says you know once we let them steal the turkey they knew they could take anything and that was the problem so Thomas Friedman says I retell that story today because it's helpful in understanding how and why we failed to contain the egregious behavior of both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin okay so Trump and Putin are very similar they each started by metaphorically speaking stealing a turkey and when we didn't respond they kept ratcheting up their wretched behavior to the point where Trump thinks he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and Putin thinks he could poison a wayward spy in London and get away with it that's pause there for a minute Trump made the joke that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it Putin poisoned a wayward spy in London and it's not the first time he has poisoned and murdered people okay so now he talks about where they started trumps Turkey was his tax returns he knew that once he compromised the GOP into giving him a pass on his taxes they'd roll over for anything okay so Trump's Turkey his first sin was not releasing his tax returns what about Putin's Turkey it was the shooting down of the Malaysian civilian airliner killing all 298 people on board so Trump not relaxing his tax returns and Putin slaughtering 300 people that's the same thing I mean this is the way these guys are thinking now they're selling this narrative to themselves first and then they come running to you and say Oh daddy daddy take the witch away I'm scared of the matchstick I mean that is what is happening to these guys so you know Trump is making these telling why he ignored the counsel of his security people and decided to tell Trump and to tell Putin congratulations of course you know Trump isn't no obligate has no obligation to follow his advisers and the fact that they leaked this is a big deal because there couldn't been that many people who knew what he was being advised so trunk tweets I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory Obama called him also in the past the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate and they're wrong getting along with Russia and others is a good thing not a bad thing Russia can help solve problems with North Korea Syria Ukraine Isis Iran and even the coming arms race Bush tried to get along but he didn't have the smarts Obama and Clinton tried but didn't have the energy or chemistry peace through strength so that's nonsense because all of the problems that he's talking about North Korea Syria Ukraine Isis Putin's on the other side it's he's not there to help you know you that that's not the point but but obviously this is the way Trump thinks he does think I can I can make this deal I'm the great deal maker maker on the news John Brennan we paid up played a little bit of this yesterday but I'm gonna play another cut John Brennan the Obama's former CIA guy is suddenly suggesting that Trump is being blackmailed by Putin and he says he has said openly he has no proof of this so a former CIA guy is accusing the president of being blackmailed with this smug little look on his face you know that is that is an amazing lapse of professional and personal integrity that's an amazing lapse I mean nothing Trump has done really nothing Trump has done has ever risen up to the level of what Brennan is saying but listen to this montage this is again from our friends at News Buster's this is a montage of the media picking up this completely fake story I mean talk about fake news is completely speculative story saying the President of the United States is being blackmailed by a tyrant fleetly made-up listen the Russians I think have had long experience with with mr. Trump and may have things that they could expose something of her señal perhaps perhaps perhaps there's obviously something that we all have been talking about for months that he Russians have on Donald Trump whether it's related to money or sex I don't know or both but there's something there do you think there's a more there's a nefarious reason is there's something sinister going on or is this just Donald Trump having great confidence in his own personal diplomacy well that's a good question and I don't think we fully understand the answer and I think that's one of the reasons why the special counsels investigation is so important it's just astonishing behavior by the president United States to make this phone call what is going on so do you agree with John Brennan that it looks like possibly this is about the Russians having something on on President Trump what is with the president's interest in these dictators broadly and Vladimir Putin specifically what is the blind spot there well that's a that's the biggest question of all and that's the question I don't think we know the answer to that may be something that turns the key and the Russia probe is figuring out why this president is so deferential to Putin and to Russia and if there is some sort of compromise that they have on him if there is another reason why he may be susceptible to basically blackmail by the Russians so they now feel free to make up any narrative they want basically they feel that they have worked themselves up into this horror at Trump's existence and if you can make any narrative they want I mean they could be saying yeah you know Trump likes power he said this stuff about Tiananmen Square that the Chinese were strong in Tiananmen Square when they crushed their own people who were protesting peaceably that's that was a stupid thing for Trump to say you could you could call him on that but what on earth are they doing you know there's a theory going around today I think I've spoken about this book sapiens which is a big bestseller you've all her re a an Israeli guy has written this book and he puts forward this theory which has been going around anyway that we are all that what makes humans unique is their ability to link them selves together by telling what he calls fictions okay so he says sapiens rule the world that's hace pians because we are the only animal that can cooperate flexibly in large numbers we can create mass cooperation networks in which thousands and millions of complete strangers work together towards common goals the mysterious glue we use is stories not genes we cooperate effectively with strangers because we believe in things like gods nations money and human rights yet none of these things exists outside the stories that people invent and tell to one another there are no gods in the universe no nations no money and no human rights except in the combination come the common imagination of human beings now as a man who has created fictions all my life I can tell you that this is completely backwards fiction is a way of communicating truth right fiction only works when you are communicating the truth it's just not the sort of truth that people like Yuval Harare understand because it's not material truth countries do exist I understand why he says they're a fiction that they are he gives credit to set what he calls inter subjective reality things we all create together but he doesn't understand that that inter subjective reality is if it works if it works is based on a truth Jonah Goldberg does this in his book and I and I love Jonah and he's a really good writer and he's written this book the suicide of the West but he says you know John Locke the great philosopher who inspired some of the founding fathers and John Locke said we are all born as a blank slate and he John Locke used that to counter the idea of the Divine Right of Kings and the eret and the rights of the aristocracy and Goldberg says that's just a story because we're not in fact born with blank slates that's true we are not but the part of the story that's true is the part that works say the thing is he got the science wrong but he did get the story right that is the way stories work and you know I mean math is a fiction you know there's no - there's no such thing as - but we find that it's a fiction that correlates to reality when we do our calculations right we can predict the future fiction is language used to contain and communicate spiritual truths the same way that our body our flesh is a language that is used to express the spiritual truth of us and Jesus is a language used in Jesus's body is a language used to express the logos religion is a fiction to describe the spirit but it matters whether that description is true it matters whether a religion gets it right or not and they and because they think that all of these things are equal fictions they think all of these things are equal fictions then all they think is they have to sell the fiction if any fiction is as good as any other all you got to do is sell it and how do you sell it I sell it by silencing the person telling a fiction I don't like that's the theory that is the thesis going on by what you're seeing in the press and you've got to keep your ball on the truth because the stories we tell have to relate to truth all right we got Michel Duran here from a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute terrific writer he has taught NYU Princeton and it's lived to tell the tale and he's written for every place the New York Times The Wall Street Journal his latest book is Ike's gamble America's rise to dominance in the Middle East it's out now it's about President Eisenhower's handling of the 1956 Suez Crisis but unfortunately for Mike we haven't brought up to talk about that but about this terrific article he wrote for National Review called the real collusion story how you doing Mike's good to see it great great to be here so III it's hard to ask you to condense this story which is a long very detailed story but give me give us at least the idea of why what you think the real collusion story is the real collusion story is that senior members of the Obama administration teamed together to frame Trump as Putin's puppet and the key guy in it which was a surprise to me when I put it together is John Brennan mm-hmm I assume that President Obama is standing behind Brennan but and I tried to to put to lay this at Obama's feet as much as I could but I think a you know I have to honestly say that I didn't prove that case it's just hard for me to believe that that if you have Brennan and Comey and and in Loretta Lynch all working together to prop up Hillary and tear down Donald Trump that the president isn't somehow aware of that so when we're watching Brennan attack Trump now we're watching him carry out something that he had planned before this essentially I think so but I think now he's in defense mode I think he's trying to inject himself into partisan politics so that when when the investigators come and they uncover what he did he will have a lot of partisan support behind him he can present it as a partisan witch hunt when it's actually justice being done so so what what is it that he did what exactly did John Brennan do to get this story I mean it's amazing that now for over a year we've been covering the story and there is still not a jot of evidence that Trump colluded with the Russians I don't I seriously just don't believe that happened it seems ridiculous here you don't believe that Carter Paige was they were investigating Jeff Sessions you know actually I know that Beauregard is pronounced Boris I think it's right so what did Brennan do I mean what exactly did he do to get the story wrong he wanted I didn't go into this bit in detail in this story because I didn't think I could prove it and after my satisfaction and it would have taken me three more pages and you know an incredibly long article that do it I think the first thing he did was he trumped up the Papadopoulos the Papadopoulos case I I don't believe the Papadopoulos gives but let's leave that aside because I don't I don't have the goods on in there but that stinks to me the whole and let me go into it just for a second actually because I worked in the White House and you know III unmasked people when I worked in the White House because there are spies all over Washington DC and there are lots of people bumping into spies foreign spies and there are FBI and NSA who are tracking foreign spies so the fact that somebody bumped into a spy that is everyday business of people in counterintelligence so what are they what did I mean what do they prove about Papadopoulos they prove that he bumped into a spy maybe they haven't even said that and you know and and then Muller has come down on Papadopoulos with all the power that Muller has to destroy your life if you don't tell him everything that he wants to know and what have they proved that he told well or something that wasn't true and that he bumped into a spy so that III think that whole thing was trumped up to begin with but what what Brennan really wanted from Comey is he wanted Comey to first of all agree with his assessment with Brennan's assessment that not just was Putin intervening in some ways in our election but that he was trying to get Donald Trump elected you see he what he was trying to do was get an intelligence community assessment that corresponded to the propaganda of the Hillary Clinton campaign which was saying just that and the other the other thing that Brennan wanted from Comey was an investigation of the Trump team for colluding with Russia which which Comey could then leaked to the press in order to in order to help out Hillary in the campaign so you know yes Hillary had this email investigation but Trump is colluding is colluding with Russia and Comey for most of the summer didn't really play ball with with Brennan but in the end he did he leaked it to the press that there was or the FBI I'm assuming Comey was winning of that that the FBI leaked to the press that Carter page was under investigation for conspiring with the Russians to help Trump get elected and then they and we we now know they also trumped up this this investigation of Carter page and they got a surveillance warrant on the basis of totally bogus information and this deal does and they basically ensured I mean Comey basically ensured that the steel dossier would become public by sharing it with Obama and Trump but right yeah yeah I left that because I I just I had to end at some point so I ended at the election now what is what is your evidence exactly that this starts with Brennan instead of call me well the if you go back and you you it what's interesting about it is that these guys they told lies right and then after the election they told new lives and so if you just go back through the press through the New York Times in the Washington Post I enjoyed doing that in the article saying according to the New York Times according the Washington Post you know Brennan felt a need I don't I'm not sure exactly why but at a certain point after the election he felt the need to cover his tracks and so he told this whole big story about how he was absolutely convinced as of early August that Putin was trying to that Putin was trying to influence the election in order to help Trump and he had this incredible information at his fingertips information that nobody else seems to have had and so forth so if you just go back through all the New York Times and Washington Post stories they tell you the story see the thing about this kind of conspiracy is that you can have conspiracies but usually they're behind closed doors to do something that people can't see in this case they wanted to influence an election so they wanted to get information out to the electorate and now that's something that you can see with your own eyes and then they then they had to go back and explain why they were doing what they were doing yeah so one of the things that go into in the article is how John Brennan organized I think with Obama's okay according to the New York Times the these briefings of members of Congress about what Brennan believed about the Putin intervening and he did that without an intelligence community assessment he told the it's clearly now in the press as a matter of record that he said things that were that he shouldn't have been talking about it all about about members of trumps team being under suspicion and so forth and he you know it's just my the only way that IP arises I say you know when he tells these things to Harry Reid one month before the the election it's because he once Harry Reid to go out and talk about them not because he's doing his due diligence as a CIA officer I tried trying to keep Congress informed you know they make fun of people for talking about deep state conspiracies but the fact is it doesn't even have to be like a movie with people in trench coats meeting on park benches it can really just be a dishonest guy and a powerful position talking to another guy and another powerful position in doing something they shouldn't be doing I mean this is deep state collusion it is deep deep state's conspiracy without the cloak-and-dagger yeah I mean the problem with the deep state idea although I use it too sometimes is that we're really talking about Obama administration and Obama official huh you know the the it's not the average CIA officer its these it's these political appointees who are working together the thing is that I I think the key we have to remember is that they all believe that Hillary was probably gonna win and a good chance they never they never thought that we'd have Jeff whatever the Beauregard sessions the third Council to go check and see what they did and and I mean Obama it was was a master of doing giving orders in plain sight I mean you talk about his charlottesville speech I believe it was Charlottesville where he gave a speech that kind of pointed people in this direction he did he did this with the IRS where he talked about dark money and it he doesn't you didn't have to call people up on a black phone somewhere and tell them this he just gave speech they knew what to do kind of I think so I think so and and I've never seen I know you talking about this all the time very effectively I've never seen the press so so helpful to another politician you know so eager to change the subject when they do something wrong and so eager to hide it to pretend that he's saying one thing when he's that clearly saying another you know so let's talk about Muller a little bit now I mean there's the other fantasy that the press keeps going into is that Trump is gonna fire Muller and they keep talking about this as if it were you know a pending thing it's it's right it's right around the corner he's gonna fire Muller the White House keeps saying nope we're not gonna do it we're not gonna do it first of all do you believe just out of curiosity do you believe the Trump would fire a Muller it just seems like a bad move i I think it probably is a bad move I think he is morally he has a moral right to do it I think he has a legal right to do it I think politically it would be harmed I'll be harmful to him so where do you stand on Muller I'm I mean i it's very hard in the the kind of swamp of you know online opinion the right thinks he is some kind of you know Democrat agent the left keeps saying what a wonderful guy is although you know if tomorrow he comes out and says there was no collusion they're gonna talk about how he was bullied in blackmailed or whatever where do you stand on Muller as just as a an investigator well I think that the Muller investigation is corrupt in a sense that the the foundations are the rush the Trump Russia collusion investigation that that I talked about in the article this this Muller is just the the logical culmination of it so I think that the that the whole thing is bogus to begin with and he's shown no signs to work outside the frame set up by Comey McCabe stroke and and and and so forth the guy I don't know I don't have a strong judgment about about the guy but I just look at the the logic of what he's doing the logic of what he's doing is is furthering the the injustice that would began with this abuse of power he strikes me you know as a certain kind of marine that I've come across in my time you say you say to a marine you know typically look I want you to take that hill and you can go by the road you know or you can go up that path or you can go through the jungle but don't go through the jungle because you can't do that the minute you tell him that you know he's gonna go through the jungle so I'm out of time but might just where do you think this is gonna end do you think mauler was going to come up with some kind of charge against Trump or is absolutely obstruction of justice he's gonna do it either right before the summer recess or right at the end of the summer recess so that the election in in in November is gonna be it's going to be a big issue in it and he can't help himself these guys the special counsels you know they they feel that they had that they that their manhood has been taken from them if they don't have some real significance it's a terrible thought Michael Duran the article is called the real collusion story at National Review Michael is also the author of Ike's at America's rise to dominance in the Middle East thanks a lot Michael is really interesting I hope you come back thank you take care all right out of time on that stuff I like somebody's got to write us a tune for stuff I like because I can't stand that anymore you know I put off I haven't finished this yet so now I usually like to finish something before I recommend it but it's so good I'm actually as close to binge-watching as I get which is like I'm watching one and a half episodes every time I sit down which I really I almost never do I put off recommending it because it's based on a book that was written by my cousin and our families were very close when I was a kid mind Hunter which is on Netflix is based on the book mind hunter by John Douglas and Mark all shaker mark all shakers my cousin and he wrote the book John Douglas of course is the FBI agent who sort of started or mastered the behavioral sciences at at the FBI his idea was you could profile when they talk about profiling killers and all this but mind hunter it kind of fiction Eliza's the story as far as I can tell it's set in 1977 and it's got these two guys jonathan groff is the young guy and Holt McHale McElhaney plays the older guy these two FBI agents who are in this world of old-fashioned old-time law busting and start to think you know we're starting to see a kind of criminal who operates without motive and the young guy is the the agent is named Holden was his name Holden Ford the young guy says you know we should go talk to these people talk to these serial killers and find out what makes them tick and everybody says why on earth would you talk to these evil people and the guy says well they're in prison they're not doing anything so here he is getting ready in this very brief scene he's getting ready to go talk to one of them Cameron Britten plays Edmund Kemper A's - it's a terrific performance as a serial killer and his partner is basically abrading him for actually doing this what are you doing just in case holdin they're not gonna let you in with a sidearm the guy is six foot nine weighs 300 pounds that's right so what's he gonna do he's gonna take the thing away from you he's gonna kill you with it and then he's gonna have sex with your face why are you so tense no I'm not tense it really makes him think Cooke is Cameron Britain is wonderful as Edmund Kemper as that as a killer but Jonathan Groff also plays Holden for there's just something not quite right about him he's like an he looks like the all-american boy and he's kind of an innocent Midwestern ER but there's just something off about him so you get the feeling there's a connection and this is the question and this is why I find I feel this this show is not just so compelling but it's also kind of profound in a way because it actually speaks directly into the issue that I kind of circling around all the time which is the way in which we have gone forward in this world following science and leaving religion behind and feeling that those two are somehow at odds instead of that they should be working together and that we have all these wonders all these terrific wonderful things around us and yet children teenagers are killing themselves I think it's like 70 percent it's gone up in the last 10 12 years and when they study this they find they have no religion in their life that no meaning in their life and when you read these books about the Enlightenment or about science they all say oh people are unhappy because they want to go back to this primitive way of religious way of thinking but it never occurs to him to them that maybe we got one thing right and one thing wrong what happened in the during the Enlightenment is scientists started to say the human mind is de siiva believing so the human mind can't be trusted a and B we were misled by attaching value to material so we were misled by ideas of teleology that things have a meaning or a purpose or for instance Plato saying the perfect shape is a as a circle therefore the orbits of the planets must be in a circle Plato didn't say that I don't think I think it was the neoplatonist but the point is that the idea that we should have kind of spiritual theories that explain material instead of doing experiments on the material themselves so they ditched the values they ditched the religion and went after the science and it worked great and so now they're saying well that religion was a problem right because this is working so great which is kind of like me you know I'm an artist my wife when she married me she was marrying an artist sometimes when they get completely wrapped up in something I become useless right I become emotionally unavailable on my mind is all wrapped up I become so absent-minded that it's like I'm almost insane my wife wants to ask me about scheduling I'm completely not there and it works right it helps me finish the book that I'm working on and the book comes out and I love the book and it's terrific and I thought it would be as if I thought to myself well that worked really well so now I'll never pay attention to my wife in other words science is a an exercise it is one thing that we do is one thing that we do and it requires a cold mind unfettered with theories or with spiritual ideas unfettered by ideas of what material should be telling us it should just be a way of finding out what material does tell us but that doesn't mean that science is the only thing we do in the only way forward when you have this world of wonders with our longer lifespans and the good health and food and all this stuff and people are killing themselves something has gone terribly wrong we have left something behind and this is what I think this story is about because here is this guy who wants to study serial killers and everybody keeps seeing but they're evil and he says yes but if I get caught up in the evil of them then I won't be able to study them if I get caught up in the moral questions I won't be able to study them therefore the moral questions are not meaningful and of course the great story that examines this exact division is Silence of the Lambs the boss character and Silence of the Lambs is based on is a fictionalization of John Douglas the guy that Marcol Shakur was writing the book about right and he sends Clarice Starling out to get the insights of Hannibal Lecter this scientist essentially they get the insights of Hannibal Lecter in about us another serial killer and Hannibal Lecter Lecter means reader and Hannibal of course is the great barbarian who almost destroyed Western civilization so Hannibal Lecter is his science he's like complete science a completely rational mind and he's crazy he's out of his mind and this is the moment when you can see when that he's trying to seduce the FBI agent into his world than one generations and poor white trash are you agent styling and that accent you've tried so desperately to shed pure West Virginia was your father day is he a coal miner distinct over land you know how quickly the boys found you all those tedious the key phone rings and the back seats of cars but you could only dream of getting out anywhere get it all the way you see a lot of doctor what are you strong enough to point high power to perception at yourself what about it why don't you why don't you look at yourself and write down what you see maybe you're afraid a census taken once tried to test me I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti the reason that line is so famous and so resonant is because the census taker represents this world of science and he devoured him because once you take the spirit away from people they just become meat that's what cannibalism is that's what zombies are it's this idea of people as meat and so even though he Lecter does deliver the insights that the FBI agent needs she needs to go back into the world of morality in order to keep from becoming him and that is what all the Hannibal Lecter books are about and it really is a fascinating story and mind hunter tells it from a more realistic and historical perspective but it's the same story of how you deal with the physical world without losing your spiritual sense of yourself because that is exactly what has happened to our society and why we've lost the logic of freedom and the Western alright but but don't worry because the claiming this weekend is here so we're all doomed however some of you may survive if you do come back here on
