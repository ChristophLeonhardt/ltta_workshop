1
00:00:00,222 --> 00:00:03,773
- Today we're gonna make
the most dangerous toys

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:04,819
of all time.

3
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:05,652
(thumps)

4
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:07,285
(screams)

5
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:08,476
Is it bad, is it bad, is it bad?

6
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,342
Oh my god.

7
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,175
Hello, guys.

8
00:00:10,175 --> 00:00:12,312
Today, as you can tell by
the title, we're gonna be

9
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:15,129
getting kids toys and
making them dangerous.

10
00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:17,432
Hopefully, you guys are
really, really excited,

11
00:00:17,432 --> 00:00:19,351
but just before we start
I want to talk to you

12
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,952
about a really cool app that
could help you out a lot.

13
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:24,807
Now, the app is called
AppBounty and it's available

14
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:27,025
on Google Play and iPhone.

15
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:29,846
The app basically allows
you to earn money.

16
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,912
Yes, real money, by
downloading applications.

17
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:35,590
You can spend your money
on iTunes codes, vouchers,

18
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,032
Amazon codes, literally
there's so much choice.

19
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:40,400
You guys know I'd only
promote an app if I love it

20
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,801
and I used to use this
app a lot to get Pokecoins

21
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,703
back when Pokemon Go was, you know, alive.

22
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:45,536
(beeps)

23
00:00:45,536 --> 00:00:48,589
Now, the way you sign up
is going to appbounty.net

24
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:50,642
and they'll say do you
want to use an invite code?

25
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:52,603
There, you'll want to use my invite code

26
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:56,436
which is (crickets chirping).

27
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,287
- [Mum] Morgz.

28
00:00:58,287 --> 00:00:59,708
- She got it right.

29
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,541
- [Mum] Whoa.

30
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,374
- Morgz.

31
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:03,052
Then, once you go into
the app, you'll be greeted

32
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:05,882
with a screen which will show
you all of the available apps

33
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:07,314
where you can earn yourself points.

34
00:01:07,314 --> 00:01:09,049
Most of the apps will
literally just ask you

35
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:11,093
to download the app
and then start the app.

36
00:01:11,093 --> 00:01:12,758
That's it and you'll earn points.

37
00:01:12,758 --> 00:01:15,178
Once you get enough points,
you can then spend them

38
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:16,689
on the stuff I mentioned earlier.

39
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:17,576
It's pretty cool.

40
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,309
So if you've got a
favourite app or just want

41
00:01:19,309 --> 00:01:21,530
to earn a little bit of
money by downloading apps

42
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:23,475
through your phone,
this is completely free

43
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:24,575
and you should definitely do it.

44
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,137
There'll be a link in the description,

45
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:28,478
so go download the app after
you've watched the video.

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,375
But guys, I think it's
about time we get started

47
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:34,186
with the most dangerous toys of all time.

48
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:35,612
- [Man] I'm ready!

49
00:01:35,612 --> 00:01:37,899
- So as you can see
down here on the table,

50
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,051
we have loads of different weapons.

51
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:40,991
They're not really weapons,

52
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,835
but we're gonna turn them into weapons.

53
00:01:42,835 --> 00:01:43,668
(claps)

54
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:46,280
We've got these really
sharp wooden spikes.

55
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,062
We've got massive paper clips.

56
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,846
We've got really sharp
nails and then we've got

57
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,553
some of these multi-colored
pin, thumbtack thingies.

58
00:01:53,553 --> 00:01:54,928
Don't really know what you call 'em.

59
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:56,072
- Oh, well done.

60
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:58,492
- Then, here we have a
freaking hot glue gun.

61
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:00,965
I feel like I'm in some sort
of science lesson right now.

62
00:02:00,965 --> 00:02:02,361
Then, you may have noticed behind me

63
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:04,430
we have loads of different toy guns

64
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,609
which we're gonna make a
little bit more deadly.

65
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:09,180
We've got a small one, a
medium one, a large one,

66
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,981
and then a frickin' extra-large one.

67
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:13,816
That one is extra-large
like fat Morgz's stomach,

68
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:15,246
like, man, that's a big one there.

69
00:02:15,246 --> 00:02:16,079
Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,211
We've also got some fidget spinners.

71
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:19,611
(snaps)

72
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:21,715
That really was kind of anticlimactic.

73
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:23,388
(slapping)

74
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:25,574
Now, you guys know I love
giving back to you guys,

75
00:02:25,574 --> 00:02:28,371
so in this video right here
we're gonna do a giveaway.

76
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:30,902
I'm gonna be giving away this nail.

77
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:32,802
- [Mum] Wait, are you joking, Morgan?

78
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:34,700
- Of course, of course I'm joking.

79
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,643
Guys, in this video I'm
gonna be giving away four,

80
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:38,501
that was three,

81
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:40,952
four 25-pound vouchers.

82
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:44,134
Gonna be giving away two
25-pound iTunes vouchers

83
00:02:44,134 --> 00:02:46,499
and two 25-pound Google Play vouchers.

84
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,248
Now, the way you actually
enter this giveaway

85
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:49,982
is a little bit different
than the other ones.

86
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:52,544
Basically, throughout this
video, this picture of my face

87
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,382
is gonna keep appearing on the screen.

88
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,956
Basically, what you have to do
is count the amount of times

89
00:02:56,956 --> 00:02:59,003
that picture appears on the
screen and then comment it

90
00:02:59,003 --> 00:03:00,320
in the comment section below.

91
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,340
Also, leave a like on
this video down below.

92
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,673
Hit that thumbs up button
and subscribe to my channel

93
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:07,678
if you are new.

94
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:08,786
That's all you have to do:

95
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:11,286
count the faces, leave
a like, and subscribe.

96
00:03:11,286 --> 00:03:13,906
Guys, let's get started
with the first toy.

97
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:15,808
Now, the first one I'm gonna
do is this one right here.

98
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:17,667
You may be thinking it looks quite small,

99
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:19,889
but in the last video
we did, the small ones

100
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,948
actually performed better
than the bigger ones.

101
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:22,899
I think we're gonna have a little bit

102
00:03:22,899 --> 00:03:24,100
of a surprise with this one.

103
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,521
- [Mum] It's not always
about size, Morgan.

104
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:26,617
- It's not always about size.

105
00:03:26,617 --> 00:03:28,392
It's about what you can
do with it, isn't it, Mum?

106
00:03:28,392 --> 00:03:30,088
That's what I keep telling myself anyway.

107
00:03:30,088 --> 00:03:30,921
(beeps)

108
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,368
Okay, guys, we've got a knife.

109
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:33,267
I'm gonna cut into this thing.

110
00:03:33,267 --> 00:03:34,239
- [Mum] Of course we've got a knife.

111
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,108
- Of course we've got a knife.

112
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:35,972
- [Mum] We can't video without a knife.

113
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:36,805
- It's a Morgz video.

114
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:37,638
(dings)

115
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:38,868
There we go, we've got a little blaster.

116
00:03:38,868 --> 00:03:40,292
Literally, pull it back, bang to shoot.

117
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,329
Now, let's rip this open
and get the bullets.

118
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,635
- [Mum] It's like Christmas, Morgan.

119
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:46,791
- Why did Nerf make it so
hard to open the dumb toy?

120
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:49,685
I'm a 15-year-old guy and
I can't even open a box.

121
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:52,480
Do you know what we do,
Mum, to empty boxes?

122
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,313
(crashes)

123
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:54,588
We throw them away.

124
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,237
- [Mum] And then Mum picks them up later.

125
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,615
- Yep, that's how it
goes most of the time.

126
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:59,640
Now, you may have already
noticed I've actually kept

127
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,645
some of the bullets
from the previous video.

128
00:04:01,645 --> 00:04:02,862
I'm gonna be using them as well

129
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:04,641
because they turned out really good

130
00:04:04,641 --> 00:04:06,774
and I may as well just
get the most out of them.

131
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:07,607
Wait, what?

132
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:08,440
I think I ...

133
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,420
Oh no, I think I bought
the wrong size glue.

134
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,597
Oh no, don't tell me I've
bought the wrong size glue.

135
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:12,921
That would be a disaster.

136
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,126
That would be an outrage.

137
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,332
(clicking)

138
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:17,166
Doesn't appear to be doing anything.

139
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,949
- [Mum] Bob the Builder (singing).

140
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:19,781
(tapping)

141
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,614
Oh dear.

142
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:22,348
It's a confused-looking boy.

143
00:04:22,348 --> 00:04:23,512
- I'm not sure what's going on here.

144
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:24,345
(beeps)

145
00:04:24,345 --> 00:04:25,610
Guys, we've managed to get it working.

146
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,791
We're gonna get started
with the first bullet

147
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,519
and I think for this
one, I'm just gonna use

148
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,973
one of these multi-colored
thumbtack things.

149
00:04:30,973 --> 00:04:32,326
We're just gonna get started.

150
00:04:32,326 --> 00:04:34,116
- [Mum] I've never even seen
one of those before, Morgan.

151
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:37,123
- It's melting it, but it's
glooping out of this side.

152
00:04:37,123 --> 00:04:39,077
This really hasn't gone
well, this, has it so far?

153
00:04:39,077 --> 00:04:41,380
Well, I mean, there we go.

154
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,828
I guess it worked just a
little bit unprofessional,

155
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:45,944
but yeah, there you go.

156
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:46,777
That's the first one.

157
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:49,056
It's literally coming out the wrong side.

158
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:50,994
I'm just gonna have to shove
it in and just (laughs).

159
00:04:50,994 --> 00:04:52,771
I think we bought the wrong
size glue to be honest.

160
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:53,815
I think that's what's happened.

161
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:54,681
- [Mum] We?

162
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,514
- Well, me.

163
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:57,496
For this one, let's do a nail.

164
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:59,241
Let's just shove a big, fat nail on there.

165
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:00,212
- [Mum] Oh my word.

166
00:05:00,212 --> 00:05:02,032
- There's two bullets, there we go.

167
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:02,865
(dings)

168
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:03,745
Time to move onto the second gun.

169
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:05,485
Now, this one looks pretty
cool because this one is

170
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,509
a blow dart, so you blow on
the end and it shoots the dart.

171
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,106
Obviously, you know I'm
good at blowing things,

172
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:11,376
so I should be good at this.

173
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:12,280
- That's what she said.

174
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,213
(laughing)

175
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,074
- I think this one's
packaged a little bit easier,

176
00:05:15,074 --> 00:05:16,154
but I'm still kind of struggling.

177
00:05:16,154 --> 00:05:17,162
I'm taking that back.

178
00:05:17,162 --> 00:05:18,511
This one is not packaged easier.

179
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:19,718
I'm still struggling.

180
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:20,904
What are they tryin' to keep out of this?

181
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,974
They protected it like it's a real gun.

182
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:23,957
(plastic cracking)

183
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:24,790
Oh my.

184
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,034
Oh my god.

185
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,496
There we go finally.

186
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:28,694
How does this one even work?

187
00:05:28,694 --> 00:05:30,182
So you blow there.

188
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:31,131
What do you do?

189
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,717
Do you like put 'em all in like that?

190
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:33,550
(thumps)

191
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,544
Oh my god.

192
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:35,920
(laughing)

193
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,180
That is amazing, oh my god.

194
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,785
(hissing)

195
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:40,690
(gasps)

196
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,633
The glue is actually set
in between the trigger.

197
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:45,163
Hold on, some's coming out.

198
00:05:45,163 --> 00:05:47,596
A little bit's coming out,
just like a tiny little bit.

199
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,016
Let's add a bloody thumbtack on the end.

200
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:49,849
Why the hell not?

201
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,682
There we go.

202
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:51,659
Seems to have stuck alright,

203
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,017
so yeah, I guess there's the first one.

204
00:05:53,017 --> 00:05:54,392
I think that'll stay.

205
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:55,589
I think we've done another one.

206
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,858
And bang.

207
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,691
There we go.

208
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,547
Three more bullets
added to the collection.

209
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:02,488
Second gun is now done.

210
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:03,646
Third gun now.

211
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:05,436
We're getting on to the big guns here.

212
00:06:05,436 --> 00:06:06,679
Literally, the big guns.

213
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:09,701
I assume that means more over-packaging

214
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,935
because literally like if
the small ones were hard

215
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:13,129
to get out of the box, god knows

216
00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:14,361
what the big ones are gonna be like.

217
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:16,604
Genuinely, why do they
feel the need to package it

218
00:06:16,604 --> 00:06:18,368
as if it's like a military weapon?

219
00:06:18,368 --> 00:06:19,201
(beeps)

220
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:20,709
- [Mum] Wow.

221
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:21,656
That's mad.

222
00:06:21,656 --> 00:06:23,690
(rattling)

223
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,523
- Wow.

224
00:06:24,523 --> 00:06:25,506
- [Mum] Wow.

225
00:06:25,506 --> 00:06:27,329
I feel like I'm with the Terminator.

226
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,162
- Jesus.

227
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:29,338
(rattling)

228
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:30,171
It's pretty cool.

229
00:06:30,171 --> 00:06:31,004
(dings)

230
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,371
Okay, we've got a lot
of bullets for this one

231
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:35,243
which means a lot more hot
glue and a lot more waiting

232
00:06:35,243 --> 00:06:38,077
for it to produce the hot glue apparently.

233
00:06:38,077 --> 00:06:39,048
Oh boy, look at that.

234
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:40,512
There we go, that's another one done.

235
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:41,764
Here we go, boys and girls,

236
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,375
we're getting another one through.

237
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,922
Can we get another one done right now?

238
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,143
I think we can.

239
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:47,043
Look at that.

240
00:06:47,043 --> 00:06:48,699
Guys, I did a few more
of these off-camera,

241
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:49,532
so look at that.

242
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,320
That's them boys done for that gun.

243
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,759
Look at that: deadly.

244
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,872
Now, guys, it's time to move on

245
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,375
to this absolutely ginormous one.

246
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,045
Literally, this is gonna be huge.

247
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,206
I don't even know where
to begin with this one.

248
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,574
Seriously, look at it.

249
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:05,225
Oh my god, if I was a kid,

250
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:07,475
I'd definitely need my
dad's help opening this.

251
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:09,205
- [Mum] Do you want me
to call him, Morgan?

252
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,038
- Yeah, 'cause honestly.

253
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:10,871
- [Mum] 'Cause you're a
kid, aren't you really?

254
00:07:10,871 --> 00:07:11,704
- I still am a kid.

255
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:13,345
(beeps)

256
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,771
What kid plays with this?

257
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:15,604
My god.

258
00:07:15,604 --> 00:07:16,671
- [Mum] Is it heavy?

259
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:17,762
- Not really.

260
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:18,941
It's just bloody huge.

261
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:20,279
- [Mum] Oh, I know what that is.

262
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,693
That's what you put the bullets in.

263
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:23,256
I think you should have a go with that one

264
00:07:23,256 --> 00:07:26,192
without any nails on it
just to see how it goes.

265
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,317
- Yeah we should, shouldn't we.

266
00:07:27,317 --> 00:07:29,273
Okay, guys, we're putting
all the bullets in now.

267
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:30,812
We're just gonna have a test run with this

268
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:33,907
before we obviously, you
know, get everything going,

269
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:36,353
but yeah, that's why I want (rattling).

270
00:07:36,353 --> 00:07:37,186
Jesus crikey.

271
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:38,019
(crashes)

272
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:39,049
- [Mum] You put it the wrong way 'round.

273
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:39,980
That's the big one.

274
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,186
- Quick little update, guys.

275
00:07:41,186 --> 00:07:43,722
We're gonna have to go to
the shop because the big gun,

276
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,828
it doesn't take AA batteries.

277
00:07:45,828 --> 00:07:48,160
It doesn't take AAA batteries.

278
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,840
It takes the really fat ones

279
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,722
that you literally use for nothing.

280
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,046
Like, what the hell?

281
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:54,792
Anyway, yeah, we're gonna
have to go to the shop

282
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:57,249
and I'll see you guys in about 20 minutes.

283
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:58,711
Okay, guys, all sorted.

284
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,392
We've got the batteries,
but while Mum was away.

285
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:04,940
Yes, I stayed home (laughs)
because I'm pretty lazy.

286
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,614
While Mum was away, I actually managed

287
00:08:06,614 --> 00:08:09,322
to work on all of the
bullets and guess what, guys?

288
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,234
It's time to roll the cinematics.

289
00:08:12,234 --> 00:08:14,282
(chiming)

290
00:08:14,282 --> 00:08:15,306
Let's do this.

291
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:19,056
("Ultimate" by Denzel Curry)

292
00:08:23,581 --> 00:08:25,426
Okay, guys, so we're back.

293
00:08:25,426 --> 00:08:28,177
We've got the batteries in
the gun and it's literally,

294
00:08:28,177 --> 00:08:29,368
we're about ready.

295
00:08:29,368 --> 00:08:31,705
Now, as you saw, I've got
all the bullets ready,

296
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:33,812
but what I actually did is I left half

297
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:36,692
of the big, red bullets in the actual gun,

298
00:08:36,692 --> 00:08:38,678
the big gun, without any pins in them.

299
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,145
That's because before we shoot it

300
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,304
with the dangerous bullets,
we want to test the gun out

301
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:43,612
with just the normal bullets.

302
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:45,321
So that's what we're gonna do right now.

303
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:49,109
I'm gonna take like 10 bullets
from that gun right now.

304
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:51,015
Mum's gonna be the one shootin' 'em.

305
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,839
Guys, one like equals one prayer

306
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,017
because I'm a little bit scared.

307
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:54,926
I'm not gonna lie.

308
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,331
Okay, Mum, whenever you're ready.

309
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:57,635
- [Mum] Alright.

310
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:59,185
Nothing's happening.

311
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,497
- Mum!

312
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:01,513
Oh!

313
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:03,846
(screaming)

314
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:08,003
- [Mum] Excellent.

315
00:09:08,003 --> 00:09:09,352
(laughing)

316
00:09:09,352 --> 00:09:10,269
- Wait, are none left yet?

317
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:11,102
Are none left?

318
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:12,244
- [Mum] No, they're all gone.

319
00:09:12,244 --> 00:09:13,077
- Oh my god.

320
00:09:13,077 --> 00:09:14,121
I got like four in the back of the head.

321
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,287
- [Mum] I know.

322
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,777
- Okay, guys, for some reason I've agreed

323
00:09:17,777 --> 00:09:20,666
to let my mum shoot me without my top on,

324
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,115
so I'm really not looking forward to this.

325
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:25,346
I'm not gonna lie.

326
00:09:25,346 --> 00:09:26,303
Ah!

327
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:28,553
(shouting)

328
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:32,325
(buzzing)

329
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,658
(screaming)

330
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:37,281
- [Mum] Are you alright, last of 'em?

331
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:38,461
- Oh my god.

332
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:39,294
(buzzing)

333
00:09:39,294 --> 00:09:40,539
Oh.

334
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,763
- [Mum] Oh, actually it is done.

335
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,447
- Oh god, that did not tickle.

336
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:44,280
(beeps)

337
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,560
So because Mum just got to shoot me twice,

338
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,341
she's agreed to let me do it once.

339
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:49,174
You ready, Mum?

340
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,086
- [Mum] Yeah.

341
00:09:50,086 --> 00:09:51,256
- [Morgz] Three,

342
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,859
two,

343
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,086
one.

344
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:54,978
(thumps)

345
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,244
- Ow.

346
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:58,244
God, that actually hurt.

347
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:01,194
No, ow.

348
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:03,240
Ow, ow, ow.

349
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,776
(laughing)

350
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:08,900
Ow.

351
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,733
Ah.

352
00:10:11,457 --> 00:10:12,290
Ow.

353
00:10:13,427 --> 00:10:14,934
- [Morgz] Headshot.

354
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:15,767
(thumps)

355
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:16,600
Oh.

356
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,847
- Oh.

357
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:18,680
Ow.

358
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,854
(laughing)

359
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,401
- That was it, that's it.

360
00:10:21,401 --> 00:10:22,454
(laughing)

361
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,717
Okay, guys, as you can see,

362
00:10:23,717 --> 00:10:26,505
we have created our own
little shooting range.

363
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:28,585
We've got smaller balloons, bigger ones.

364
00:10:28,585 --> 00:10:31,230
We're gonna try and pop
all of these with the guns.

365
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,487
So we're gonna start with the mini-pistol.

366
00:10:33,487 --> 00:10:34,810
Literally, simple as it gets.

367
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,159
I'm just gonna get one
of these small, actually.

368
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,479
These take the big darts, actually.

369
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,312
(dings)

370
00:10:39,312 --> 00:10:41,550
We're gonna get one of these
big darts with the spike end.

371
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,043
I'm gonna put that in there

372
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:44,168
and I'm gonna just give it a shot.

373
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:45,178
Which one should I aim for.

374
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:46,011
Give me one.

375
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,623
- [Mum] A middle one, the middle blue.

376
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:48,456
- [Morgz] Middle blue.

377
00:10:48,456 --> 00:10:49,289
Three,

378
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,122
two,

379
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:50,955
one.

380
00:10:50,955 --> 00:10:51,866
(pops)

381
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:52,954
Easy as you like.

382
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:54,065
- [Mum] Whoa.

383
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:55,910
- Easy as you like, guys.

384
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,805
Mum, check this trick shot out.

385
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:58,873
(thumps)

386
00:10:58,873 --> 00:10:59,706
- Ah.
- Oh.

387
00:10:59,706 --> 00:11:00,539
- What did it hit?

388
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:01,372
- [Mum] Nothing.

389
00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,353
- [Morgz] Three, two, one.

390
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,149
(thumps)

391
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:05,982
Wow.

392
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:06,820
Wow.

393
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:07,978
- [Mum] Not very good.

394
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:09,284
- That was very anticlimactic, wasn't it?

395
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:10,117
- [Mum] Yeah.

396
00:11:10,117 --> 00:11:11,230
- Okay, that wasn't too bad.

397
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,047
I mean, when I was aiming
front-on, I got one,

398
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,098
but when I stared getting
a little bit cocky

399
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:16,010
couldn't really do it.

400
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,808
Yeah, anyway what we're
gonna do now is move on

401
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:18,641
to the blowgun.

402
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:21,704
This is the one that I am
by far the most excited for

403
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:23,999
just 'cause I've never
seen anything like it.

404
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:24,890
Can it do four?

405
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,969
It can do four, guys.

406
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:27,369
We've got some wooden ones.

407
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,831
We got some pin ones.

408
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:32,448
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna
put my mouth around it.

409
00:11:32,448 --> 00:11:34,889
- [Mum] Blow double sort to one dud.

410
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:36,818
- [Morgz] No way did I miss all four.

411
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:38,041
Are you kidding me?

412
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:38,874
- [Mum] That was so cool.

413
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:39,851
- Mum, I'm mad.

414
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:40,687
What am I doing?

415
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:41,919
- [Mum] Just open it up.

416
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,083
- Okay, we've got the wooden dart.

417
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,631
I'm gonna aim for the
big green one down there.

418
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,486
Three,

419
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:46,319
two,

420
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:47,152
one.

421
00:11:47,152 --> 00:11:49,063
(hissing)

422
00:11:49,063 --> 00:11:50,152
- [Mum] Oops.

423
00:11:50,152 --> 00:11:50,985
Oops.

424
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:54,185
- Not been very good so far, has it, Mum?

425
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:55,088
- [Mum] No.

426
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,705
- I think it's 'cause we
only put one in that time.

427
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,182
I think we've just got to put three in.

428
00:11:58,182 --> 00:11:59,900
Three bullets are in, guys.

429
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,733
Three,

430
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:01,566
two,

431
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:02,644
one.

432
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:03,477
(pops)

433
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:04,310
Yes!

434
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,181
- [Mum] Whoa.

435
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,072
- Finally.

436
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:06,905
Come on.

437
00:12:06,905 --> 00:12:08,534
- [Mum] What a bang in that one there.

438
00:12:08,534 --> 00:12:09,677
- I'm sorry, but this one is that cool.

439
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:10,782
- It's good, yeah.
- I'm just gonna go again.

440
00:12:10,782 --> 00:12:13,393
Okay, blowgun loaded
with three more darts.

441
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,784
Three, two,

442
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:15,617
one.

443
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:16,450
(inhales)

444
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,283
(thumps)

445
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,737
How have I missed again?

446
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,302
That's enough for the blow dart, guys.

447
00:12:20,302 --> 00:12:21,157
We're moving on.

448
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,992
Okay, we're moving on to this one now

449
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,334
which looks like a beast.

450
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,170
Not really sure how you work it though.

451
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,787
I'm not sure if these bullets
are actually gonna go in,

452
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:29,940
like more than one of them,

453
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,164
so I think what we're gonna have to do is

454
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,245
we're gonna have to put one at the top

455
00:12:32,245 --> 00:12:34,285
and then just keep putting
one in if you get me.

456
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:35,118
Three,

457
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:35,951
two,

458
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:36,784
one.

459
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:37,752
(clicking)

460
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:38,585
Oh, there we go.

461
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:39,418
Bang!

462
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:40,251
(record screeching)

463
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:41,084
Wait, what?

464
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:42,231
(clicks)

465
00:12:42,231 --> 00:12:43,689
What on Earth is happening?

466
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,939
(rattling)

467
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,526
This hasn't really gone
to plan, has it, Mum?

468
00:12:49,526 --> 00:12:50,359
Bloody hell.

469
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,677
Mum, I don't know where it's gone.

470
00:12:51,677 --> 00:12:53,153
I've just looked and it's in there.

471
00:12:53,153 --> 00:12:55,520
(rattling)

472
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,954
It just fell out.

473
00:12:56,954 --> 00:12:59,161
So for this one, guys, I guess
we're just gonna have to do

474
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:01,415
with the normal bullets,
but I'm actually interested

475
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:04,070
to see if the normal bullet
will be enough to pop a balloon.

476
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,543
So, you know, I'm still damn excited.

477
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:07,198
I'm still very frickin' excited for this.

478
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:09,539
Also, guys, I forgot to
mention do not try this at home

479
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,204
because this is pretty frickin' dangerous.

480
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:12,162
Okay, we've got it.

481
00:13:12,162 --> 00:13:13,506
We're gonna shove it right in there.

482
00:13:13,506 --> 00:13:14,339
(rattling)

483
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,172
Oh god.

484
00:13:15,172 --> 00:13:16,005
Okay, there we go.

485
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:16,838
Pull back,

486
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:17,671
push forward.

487
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,504
Here we go.

488
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,642
Mum, give me one to aim for.

489
00:13:19,642 --> 00:13:23,402
- [Mum] That blue one on the
left of the one that's popped.

490
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:24,518
- [Morgz] Do you mean
that one right there?

491
00:13:24,518 --> 00:13:25,351
(thumps)

492
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,263
Oh, wow.

493
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,549
It didn't pop it.

494
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:28,904
Hold on, I've got an idea.

495
00:13:28,904 --> 00:13:29,928
Three, two,

496
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:30,761
one.

497
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:31,810
(thumps)

498
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,817
Oh my god.

499
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,303
These balloons are sturdy.

500
00:13:34,303 --> 00:13:35,348
Surely now.

501
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,181
Three,

502
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,014
two,

503
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:37,847
one.

504
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,593
(clicks)

505
00:13:39,593 --> 00:13:41,843
(clicking)

506
00:13:50,021 --> 00:13:50,854
Wow.

507
00:13:50,854 --> 00:13:51,687
Ah.

508
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:52,520
(pops)

509
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,353
(laughs)

510
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,186
(banging)

511
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:55,019
No, what the hell?

512
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:55,852
(bangs)

513
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:56,685
What the hell?

514
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:57,518
(bangs)

515
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:58,638
Oh my god.

516
00:13:58,638 --> 00:13:59,471
(beeps)

517
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,681
That's enough of that gun, guys.

518
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,036
It didn't go very well, did it?

519
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:02,869
(dings)

520
00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:05,444
Okay, guys, now it is
time for the big one.

521
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,265
Guys, the problem with this is

522
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:09,374
it's kind of the same
problem as the last gun.

523
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:10,835
You can't actually fit these in.

524
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:11,761
I don't know if you can tell,

525
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:13,344
but it won't actually go 'round and in.

526
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:15,859
So guys, unfortunately, the really big gun

527
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,379
literally just stopped working.

528
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:19,572
We went all out shopping, got
them for literally nothing.

529
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:21,876
I know it's a bit annoying, but
at least we actually did get

530
00:14:21,876 --> 00:14:23,118
to shoot it earlier in the video.

531
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:24,746
Guys, I'm not gonna let you down.

532
00:14:24,746 --> 00:14:26,574
I'm gonna take this to the next level

533
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,193
because what I've done,
I've got the old gun

534
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:30,838
from the last video and I'm
gonna heat up these nails

535
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:33,636
on the end to make them
hopefully 1000 degrees

536
00:14:33,636 --> 00:14:34,915
and then shoot them at that.

537
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,452
Guys, we are taking this
to a whole new level.

538
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:38,766
So what we're gonna do, we're gonna go up

539
00:14:38,766 --> 00:14:40,945
to the kitchen right now,
we're gonna turn the hob on,

540
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:42,501
and we're gonna burn these nails

541
00:14:42,501 --> 00:14:45,283
to make them hopefully
red hot and 1000 degrees.

542
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,832
Then, we're gonna rush
back down, come here,

543
00:14:47,832 --> 00:14:49,209
and shoot some dumb balloons.

544
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:50,728
So, Mum, let's go.

545
00:14:50,728 --> 00:14:53,066
It is quite annoying that
the red gun didn't work,

546
00:14:53,066 --> 00:14:54,742
but I think this is gonna be even better.

547
00:14:54,742 --> 00:14:56,040
Okay, we're at the hob right now.

548
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,072
I'm literally just gonna
hold the nails over it.

549
00:14:58,072 --> 00:14:59,946
I'm gonna make sure
not to burn the plastic

550
00:14:59,946 --> 00:15:01,123
because that wouldn't be good.

551
00:15:01,123 --> 00:15:01,956
Oh no.

552
00:15:02,885 --> 00:15:03,718
It melted.

553
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:05,008
Okay, one of them has died.

554
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:06,261
Actually, that was the one
with the glue on the end.

555
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,370
- [Mum] Melted then.

556
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,925
- Okay, the other ones will be fine.

557
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,133
Oh no, fire.

558
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:11,214
We have fire.

559
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:14,848
These are literally flaming
darts, like these are flaming.

560
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:16,161
Mum, do you reckon that's ready?

561
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:17,713
- [Mum] I reckon that's very ready.

562
00:15:17,713 --> 00:15:18,806
- [Morgz] Do you reckon it's very ready?

563
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:19,639
- [Mum] Very ready.

564
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:20,677
- [Morgz] Well, then
quick, let's rush down.

565
00:15:20,677 --> 00:15:21,667
We've got to keep the heat.

566
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:22,551
We've got to keep the heat.

567
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:23,736
Okay, you ready, Mum?

568
00:15:23,736 --> 00:15:24,569
(clicks)

569
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:25,402
- [Mum] Yeah.

570
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:26,235
- Okay, here we go.

571
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,422
Three, two, one.

572
00:15:27,422 --> 00:15:28,255
(thumps)

573
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,404
Oh no, come on.

574
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,258
Three, two, one.

575
00:15:31,258 --> 00:15:32,739
(clicks)

576
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:34,434
(laughs)

577
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,267
Quick.

578
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,617
Please.

579
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:38,152
No, what the hell?

580
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,650
If we don't even destroy one of them,

581
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,983
then this is gonna be terrible.

582
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:41,816
Three,

583
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:42,649
two,

584
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,482
one.

585
00:15:43,482 --> 00:15:44,872
(clicks)

586
00:15:44,872 --> 00:15:46,097
- [Mum] One more go.

587
00:15:46,097 --> 00:15:46,930
Go Morgan.

588
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,239
- Oh my god.

589
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,427
Oh my god.

590
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:50,760
Three, two, one.

591
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,672
(pops)

592
00:15:52,672 --> 00:15:53,765
- [Mum] Yay.

593
00:15:53,765 --> 00:15:54,598
(sighs)

594
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:55,431
- Finally.

595
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:56,264
Oh my goodness.

596
00:15:56,264 --> 00:15:57,097
(beeps)

597
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,563
If you've seen the last video we did,

598
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:01,042
you'll know that the shotgun
was absolutely amazing.

599
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:03,190
We seem to have loads of bullets left,

600
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,610
so what we're gonna do is we're
just gonna do a full round

601
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,824
of the shotgun to shoot a shotgun test.

602
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:08,679
This one now.

603
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,512
Three,

604
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:10,345
two,

605
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,178
one.

606
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,011

607
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:12,844

608
00:16:12,844 --> 00:16:13,677
(pops)

609
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:14,510
(clicking)

610
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,384
(popping)

611
00:16:15,384 --> 00:16:16,217
Oh, oh, oh,

612
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:17,582
- [Mum] Brilliant.

613
00:16:17,582 --> 00:16:20,102
- I was silent then, I
was focused, and we popped

614
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:21,279
I think, three balloons.

615
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,333
Let's go get the bullets.

616
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,097
It is time for round two.

617
00:16:24,097 --> 00:16:25,054
Here we go.

618
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:27,893
I'm gonna try and take
out all the red balloons,

619
00:16:27,893 --> 00:16:29,365
so show them the red balloons.

620
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:30,631
Three, two,

621
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:31,464
one.

622
00:16:31,464 --> 00:16:32,414
(pops)

623
00:16:32,414 --> 00:16:33,936
Good start, boys, good start.

624
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:35,131
Three, two,

625
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:35,964
one.

626
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:36,797
(pops)

627
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:37,630
(clicks)

628
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,463
Brilliant.

629
00:16:38,463 --> 00:16:39,296
- [Mum] Whoa.

630
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,290
- [Morgz] Look at the size of these too.

631
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,232
- They're tiny.
- These ones are tiny.

632
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:42,887
So three, two,

633
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:43,720
one.

634
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,553
(clicks)

635
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:45,989
Oh, come on.

636
00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:47,055
Three,

637
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,084
two,

638
00:16:48,084 --> 00:16:48,917
one.

639
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:49,750
(clicks)

640
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,876
You know what, the smaller ones

641
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,066
are actually harder to break.

642
00:16:52,066 --> 00:16:52,899
Have you noticed?

643
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:53,732
- [Mum] Yeah.

644
00:16:53,732 --> 00:16:54,565
- Wow.

645
00:16:54,565 --> 00:16:55,933
I want to actually test
out the small one again

646
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:58,043
because I feel like we didn't
give this one enough time.

647
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,056
What should we go for, Mum?

648
00:16:59,056 --> 00:16:59,911
- [Mum] The big purple one over there.

649
00:16:59,911 --> 00:17:01,030
- Big purple one.

650
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,863
Three, two,

651
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:02,696
one.

652
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:03,820
(popping)

653
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,153
(screaming)

654
00:17:07,196 --> 00:17:08,331
That was amazing.

655
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:09,415
Oh my god.

656
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:10,268
Double.

657
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:11,611
- [Mum] How did you do that?

658
00:17:11,611 --> 00:17:13,766
- Double kill, boys, we got a double kill.

659
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,753
(humming)

660
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:18,756
- [Mum] What did I say at
the beginning of the video?

661
00:17:18,757 --> 00:17:19,736
- Small is better than big.

662
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:20,569
- [Mum] Small is better.

663
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,402
- Small is better.

664
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:22,234
- [Mum] Yeah.

665
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:23,416
Go for the middle yellow.

666
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,249
- Middle yellow.

667
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,618
Do you know what, Mum?

668
00:17:25,618 --> 00:17:26,628
Eyes closed.

669
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,961
Three, two, one.

670
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,191
(pops)

671
00:17:30,191 --> 00:17:31,487
- [Mum] Wow.

672
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:33,105
- Oh, they're gonna think that's fake.

673
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:34,446
- [Mum] That wasn't
fake, that wasn't fake.

674
00:17:34,446 --> 00:17:35,399
- Oh, they're gonna think that's fake.

675
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:36,232
Wait, Mum?

676
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:37,065
- [Mum] Yeah?

677
00:17:37,065 --> 00:17:38,273
- What's that behind me?

678
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:39,314
- [Mum] A hole in my wall.

679
00:17:39,314 --> 00:17:40,147
(beeps)

680
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:40,980
- Look at this one, guys.

681
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,328
This is a double.

682
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,785
This is a double one, okay?

683
00:17:43,785 --> 00:17:44,955
This is going in.

684
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:45,788
One.

685
00:17:45,788 --> 00:17:46,621
(pops)

686
00:17:46,621 --> 00:17:49,014
Easy stuff, boys and girls, easy stuff.

687
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,300
(popping)

688
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,049
Oh, that feels amazing.

689
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,154
Wait, one more time.

690
00:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,172
One more time.

691
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:55,005
(pops)

692
00:17:55,005 --> 00:17:55,838
Oh.

693
00:17:55,838 --> 00:17:56,980
That feels so cool.

694
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,248
- [Mum] You're a big child, Morgan.

695
00:17:58,248 --> 00:17:59,081
(dings)

696
00:17:59,081 --> 00:18:00,785
- Okay, Mum, do you know what time it is?

697
00:18:00,785 --> 00:18:02,146
- [Mum] Time to go to bed?

698
00:18:02,146 --> 00:18:04,492
- Time for me to get shot.

699
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:05,409
- [Mum] No.

700
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:07,236
- Yep.

701
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,116
- [Mum] You don't really?

702
00:18:08,116 --> 00:18:08,949
- It's gotta happen again.

703
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:09,782
- [Mum] No.

704
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,218
- Guys, you better leave a like.

705
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:12,281
I'm gonna take a bullet.

706
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:13,134
- [Mum] Not again.

707
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,999
- Guys, leave a like right now.

708
00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:16,141
I'm probably gonna bleed.

709
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,405
I did bleed last time.

710
00:18:17,405 --> 00:18:20,045
Guys, you better leave a
like for this and subscribe.

711
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,376
Wow.

712
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,241
Here we go.

713
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:24,122
My goodness, I'm not ready for this.

714
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:25,029
Okay, guys.

715
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:26,535
I'm gonna count you down, Mum.

716
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:28,314
Actually, I'll let you count down.

717
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:30,079
So I'm gonna let her shoot me in my bum.

718
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,161
I'm gonna bend over.

719
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:32,220
I'm actually really nervous.

720
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,659
The last time it made me bleed
if you didn't see the video.

721
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:35,576
Oh man, oh.

722
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:37,797
- [Mum] What we're doing?

723
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:38,878
- Oh, don't, oh.

724
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,029
- [Mum] I don't want to do it.

725
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:41,087
- Ah.

726
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,220
- [Mum] Ten, nine.

727
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,399
- Oh, come on.

728
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:44,232
(thumps)

729
00:18:44,232 --> 00:18:46,565
(screaming)

730
00:18:46,565 --> 00:18:47,748
- Oh, oh.

731
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:49,095
- You didn't hit my bum.

732
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,617
- [Mum] I know, I'm not
very good at aiming.

733
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:52,027
- Oh, no, no, no.

734
00:18:52,027 --> 00:18:52,862
Ah.

735
00:18:52,862 --> 00:18:53,695
- [Mum] Oh god.

736
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:54,686
Oh my.

737
00:18:54,686 --> 00:18:55,567
You alright?

738
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,498
You asked me to do it,
but I feel awful now.

739
00:18:57,498 --> 00:18:58,331
- Where's the blood?

740
00:18:58,331 --> 00:18:59,164
I can't see it.

741
00:18:59,164 --> 00:18:59,997
- [Mum] Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

742
00:18:59,997 --> 00:19:00,830
- Is it bad, is it bad, is it bad?

743
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,663
- [Mum] No, no, no.

744
00:19:01,663 --> 00:19:02,496
Come back in here.

745
00:19:02,496 --> 00:19:03,329
Just come back in.

746
00:19:03,329 --> 00:19:04,162
- [Morgz] Should I just?

747
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:04,995
Oh my god.

748
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:05,828
- [Mum] Come back in here.

749
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:06,661
It's only a bit.

750
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:08,243
- I've bled worse than that, but Jesus.

751
00:19:08,243 --> 00:19:09,116
That is quite a lot, that.

752
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:10,142
I can feel it on my top.

753
00:19:10,142 --> 00:19:11,994
We're gonna have to wash
the top after the video.

754
00:19:11,994 --> 00:19:13,261
Well, thanks for that, Mum.

755
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:14,290
- [Mum] No, it's alright.

756
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,269
I mean, anytime.

757
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:16,102
(sighs)

758
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:17,089
I did aim for your bum by the way

759
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,015
'cause I know you've got--

760
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:18,848
- You hit me in the back.

761
00:19:18,848 --> 00:19:20,019
- [Mum] But the bum ...

762
00:19:20,019 --> 00:19:21,077
- That's a terrible place to be hit.

763
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:21,910
- [Mum] I know.

764
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,789
- Well, that was that, guys.

765
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,245

Mum's gonna go and probably go to bed.

As always, I've been
Morgz, she's been Mum.

Peace out.

788
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,128
- [Mum] Morgan.

789
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,626
If anybody comes to the
door, just ignore it.

790
00:20:14,626 --> 00:20:17,466
It might be like child
services thinking cruelty.

791
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,538
- Oh yeah, that is true.

792
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:19,438
You did just make your son bleed.

793
00:20:19,438 --> 00:20:20,271
- [Mum] Cruelty.

794
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,510
Yeah, so I'm gonna deny it,

795
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,831
but it's gonna be
difficult if it's on film.

796
00:20:22,831 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughing)
