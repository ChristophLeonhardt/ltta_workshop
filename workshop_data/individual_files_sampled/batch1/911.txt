sidestepping US sanctions the European Union goes ahead with a new payment system for business transactions with Iran Russia and China say they're on hold but can companies and traders would stand the US response this is inside story hello and welcome to the program I'm Elizabeth puranam when it was signed in 2015 the Iran nuclear agreement was hailed as a landmark deal but would the US withdrawal earlier this year and threats of punishing those who do business with Tehran European leaders have been left trying to figure out a way to protect their companies and save the agreement the Trump administration says it will reimpose some of its toughest sanctions on Iran in November and that's led some companies to abandon their plans in Iran but the Europeans say they're setting up a new payment mechanism that will allow companies to continue trading goods and/or as with Iran Russia and China support the plan but it's not clear how it work we'll discuss that with our guests in a moment but first she Hobart Anzhi sets up bar discussion from the UN General Assembly in New York the EU was reported to have been discussing what it calls a special purpose vehicle for several weeks and on Monday night the EU foreign policy chief said it would be going ahead EU Member States will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions with Iran and this will allow European companies to continue to trade with Iran in accordance with European Union law and could be open to other partners in the world the plans discussed in the past have involved an entity being set up to act as a go-between or Clearing House between Iran and other nations to facilitate commercial transactions for example if a country or company wants to buy Iranian oil it would send money to or perhaps engage in a barter system involving this entity which will handle the transaction with Iran the same will be true in Reverse for Iran's dealings with the rest of the world the idea is to bypass commercial and central banks who are fearful of being frozen out of the US financial system if they help circumvent the new sanctions being imposed by the Trump administration against Iran in November however the details have yet to be worked out and there is some skepticism that the system will work especially given the large number of European companies already curtailing their business dealings with Iran those meeting at the UN also announced that around remained in compliance with the nuclear deal and pledged their commitment to remain participants the meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly didn't just involve European foreign ministers but the foreign ministers of Russia and China as well meeting with Iran coming as it did on the eve before Donald Trump addresses the UN General Assembly this was a sign of real international solidarity here in New York share Britain see al Jazeera New York well let's introduce our guests now joining us from Paris is Remy Borgia and economist to the French Institute of International and strategic affairs and an investment strategist in London as mom Liu Salam a an international oil economist and joining us on skype from Ho Chi Minh City is Christopher balding an analyst on the Chinese economy and also a professor at the Fulbright University Vietnam a very warm welcome to all of you mr. Bazo can the EU design a legal shield to protect its companies in Iran you know to beat the reach of the US financial system well there's a political willingness to to try something and it's technically feasible to set up a mechanism that would not include using the US dollar but even though it's it's it's technically feasible it's mainly a political gesture because in the end European companies very much fear the legal consequences in the United States from dealing with Iran whatever the sector especially in those sectors which are being targeted by by the tribes administer trevor administration's sanctions so it's it's mostly a political signal sent to Iran so that it's my stay in in the nuclear deal but in the end European companies are very unlikely to return to Iran and the the the ratio this current sanctions regime the only actual possibility was for the you to negotiate waivers with the US administration but it was quite clear very early in those talks that the US administration was not willing to to grant any significant exemption from from its sanctions so at this point for European companies it's it's not a real real prospect you to return to your on most of them announced very fast after Donald Trump's announcement the day which we throw from Iran so there's some interest in that kind of mechanism outside Europe also in in countries like India yeah let's talk about what I want to talk more about the mechanism the different mechanisms that are being proposed because a political signal might not be enough to keep Iran in the nuclear deal mr. selami we don't have the details of what's being called the special purpose vehicle yet but whatever it is going to be are the bodies that are going to be involved will they have to be exempt from doing considerable business in the US for this mechanism to be feasible it is not difficult at all because Iran's oil exports can be paid for by the euro thus avoiding the dollar or what you call the petrodollar another thing is that the European Union has laws which protect companies deciding to continue business with Iran and that will protect them against you as sanctions but above all there is an alternative to the US banking system and the petrodollar which is the petrol one which can bypass completely the petrodollar and allow Iran to be paid for its exports in the Petra one or alternatively in gold the Petra one now accounts for 32 percent of the global oil trade so it is a valid alternative to the dollars and it has also nullified basically the US sanctions on Iran well let me put some of those points to our guest Christopher Bolden is the Chinese Petro you are a viable alternative to buying oil from Iran you know cannot bypass US sanctions altogether or can the European Union can European countries in fact do business by oil from Iran using the euro well they could they could buy an enemy currency they want but but it's it's it's completely inaccurate to say that the RMB is now a global substitute for the dollar when it comes to the oil trade what what is being discussed here is that in Shanghai Chinese government has set up an oil futures trading platform in Shanghai and this has garnered significant trading volume what is very important to note though and this is the important part oil suppliers are still paid in hard currency so the the transaction will take place such that it will be denominated inside of China in RMB however if you know if Saudi Arabia if anybody else wants to take that money out of China they have to turn it into dollars euros whatever they want and so it's completely inaccurate to say that global oil suppliers can get can get paid in RMB their the amount of RMB outside of China is is is virtually negligible almost zero in the grand scheme of things but mr. Valda new thing is but-but-but China can buy Iranian oil in its Chinese RMB right yes but if Iran wants to use that money that that money that they've been paid they have to turn it into dollars or Euros or whatever they want and take it back to Tehran as long as they want to use that rmv that they've received inside of China they can use that RMB inside of China if they want to take that money RMB out of China it's immediately converted into dollars euros mr. Bazo can the European Union by oil from Iran using heroes instead of dollars and bypass US sanctions that way well it's it's theoretically possible but that would involve European companies energy companies and those are also most of the market of in the United States and most large European companies are somehow involved with other US companies and that's why they fear so much do any any lego lawsuit so that's that's a real issue they're facing it's not just about choosing in which currency you you trade with with Iran the the sanctions have really centered on the currency on the the dollars international role but it's not just about that the very phrasing of the sanctions has evolved very much over the years and it's clearly targeting sectors and companies in a very precise way and for a European company or from any other country which is also doing business with the United States it's very complicated there are clear legal consequences of continuing any operations in Iran what senator you know obviously does not protect those companies so what if we leave currency out of this because one of the ideas being proposed is a barter system mr. selami you know could we see a return of the sort of barter system that was used during the Cold War by Moscow where Iranian Goods and oil are exchanged without money changing hands well let me point out something I am of the opinion and I am convinced that you are sanctions on Iran will fail miserably and Iran will not lose a single barrel of oil from its oil exporter and that is my reasoning is based on five market facts the first fact is that the global the overwhelming majority of nations with the exception of Saudi Arabia and possibly Israel Israel are against the sanctions on Iran because Iran has not violated the nuclear agreement the second thing as I mentioned and that's the most important one is the petra one the petra one has become a thorn on the side of the United States because it Mel defies the entire US sanctions against Iran and provides an alternative for Iran to be paid Iran can be paid in the Petra one for any exports it sends to China it can be paid in the euro for any exports to the European Union which account for 20% of Iranian exports and it can be paid by barter trade with the likes of Turkey and India a third thing is that China is any position to nullify the entire US sanctions against Iran by buying the whole exports of Iran 2.5 million barrels a day and pay for them in the petrol one let me be that point mr. selami I do want to put that point to our China analyst Christopher balding is China in that position to buy all of Iran's crude oil and would it be willing to do so is that realistic they could buy they could buy Iran's daily output of oil that is absolutely accurate Chinese oil consumption continues to rise relatively rapidly their influence on global price setting is very important however they do not pay in RMB if Iran to get paid and receive currency in Iran it's not the RMB it's when that money leaves China it gets converted from RMB $2 heroes whatever I do think I agree with your first guest that the currency is largely irrelevant it really has to do with with if a company has business in the United States they face the possibility that they're going to be sanctioned and either going to be denied access to the US market financial system or whatever and so being able to trade in a dollar overseas or a euro is is really irrelevant it's the business exposure that they would have to the US market orphanages and mr. bourgeois does that bring us back to the point you know that these measures being proposed can they really challenge US financial dominance given that the true source of u.s. power lies in the global role of the US dollar you know the predominance of the American financial system well the key thing is that the US administration is unwilling to give any exemption so as if a company's doing business and unit in the United States is currently affords to two to stay in in Iran in anyway it's it's getting very complicated and the European low is supposed to prevent them from from a cancelling a contract because of US sanctions or the sanction imposed by any third country but in the end in a very concrete way they are facing legal actions from from the United's and even illegal action has the pull out the fallout of the u.s. pulling out of this Iran nuclear deal expose just how vulnerable Europe is to being held hostage to the US Treasury you know does Europe need to overcome this well it's it's very hard to overcome this actually in a technical way it's it's mainly a political issue between Europe in Iran and between Europe and the United States and there's no actual technical trick to to bypass that it's not just about the dollars international roll it's about the intertwining of the US and the European economy and that's why it's it's it's so these sanctions are hurting European company's involvement in Iran so so effectively in a way civ it's because any large European company has some interests in the United States it's not just about the dollar and it cannot afford to to just sacrifice that you to keep its operations its investments or it exports to to Iran running and it is of course about politics you - and you know you said at the beginning of the show that this is sending a political signal more than anything else mr. selami what do you make of the matter of the timing of the statement from the EU and Iran you know just before Donald Trump addresses the UN General Assembly one analyst said that this is a poke in the eye for Trump do you think this is a humiliation for Donald Trump it it is a very important statement because the European Union has made it clear from the start that they will not comply by you as sanctions because if very were to comply with that it will be the end of the nuclear agreement with Iran and they are keen to preserve that agreement because it's important for world peace and consequently that signals their insistence that they will not comply with us Asia it's a real signal to the Americans that the sanctions are weak and they will not work and I tell you that the sanctions as I mentioned will fail miserably and the European Union will continue to deal with Iran particularly that 95 percent of Iran's oil exports go to four groups of countries one is China which accounts for 35% the other India which accounts for 233 person then the European Union which accounts for 20% and Turkey for 7% that's a total it certainly is sharing them all of them are against the sanctions against Iran but as being against the sanctions enough mr. balding do you think that the message here you know is more important than any details of a financial system by showing that they're working to keep European investment flowing into Iran European leaders hoping that that's enough to keep Iran in a nuclear deal well I think what's what's important to notice is that it is it isn't just you it's it's it's basically the major powers excluding the United States and so the first thing is that sense not just an EU message but that sends a very strong political message globally about about the political cover that is being provided I think to follow up on the point you made about how much do the details matter I think they matter enormous Lee when they talk about SPV any special purpose vehicle and even though we don't have the specifics there are a lot of different ways that you could structure this to make it very very difficult for the United States government to impose sanctions whether it was some type of company that had no no ties to the US financial system or payment systems that was maybe domiciled in in a unique country so that so the European oil companies could deal with that company and so that they would have plausible deniability as to where the oil was coming from I think there's different ways to do this and I think it's very important that it is very strong political message being sent to you guys but around of course can't survive on messages and words alone right mr. Borgia I think it's lost something like the rial has lost about two-thirds of its value this year so if world powers Europe China and Russia cannot ease Iran's grave economic woes will it stay in the nuclear deal that promised it in easing of sanctions well it's difficult for the European Union to do something about this if European companies are not willing to to deal with Iran and they have reason of course to fear a US sanctions and under the the the current framework so there's little they can do so that they're sending political messages because of course European governments are very concerned about the consequences for the whole Middle Eastern region of a disability of the the Iranian system that's one main thing but economically there are directions are likely to remain quite limited so the way things do you think Iran will stay in the nuclear deal the way things are going now the way that things have been going the rial the economy full sanctions do to be imposed I think on the 4th of November is Iran gonna stay in this deal well the Iran is under a tremendous pressure it's waiting to see how things will evolve whether they will really be no exemption at all from from the US or so so so few as they've they've implied but there's clearly also a domestic political issue in Iran between the hardliners and and the moderates within the regime that's that's very complicated and the hardliners are emboldened to to some extent the moderates have appeared to be in retreat in in terms of the political their political message and and importance so it's there's there's little actually to do with such an pressure and there's certainly more to do in Asia and that China's eagerness to to to continue importing Iranian criticism is certainly of great importance to around but it's it's very complicated in Europe's position to really find a solution to to Iran's difficulties and if it doesn't then mr. selami you know if I know that you're very positive that nuclear deal can stay in place but if it doesn't what message does that send Center Donald Trump and the world you know that he can unilaterally pull out of a deal well international experts are vouching that Iran is sticking by it and the international community can't do anything about it if Iran was forced by circumstances to leave the nuclear deal the alternative is war in the Gulf egged by Israel and supported by Saudi Arabia there is escalation between Saudi Arabia and Iran so it a war could be sparked by one incident or another and it will be damaging to the whole Middle East and it will be the end of American national interests in the whole Arab Gulf consequently it's better that Iran stays and helped is helped and promoted to stay within the nuclear deal by support from the other signatories of the deal mr. selami thank you very much for that we have run out of time so I would like to thank all of our guests Remi Bordeaux in Paris mum do Salam a in London and Christopher balding in Ho Chi Minh and thank you too for watching you can see the program again anytime by visiting our website al Jazeera comm and for further discussion that do go to our Facebook page that's Facebook calm /aj inside story you can also join the conversation on Twitter a handle is at AJ inside story from me Elizabeth puranam and the entire team here in Doha bye for now you
