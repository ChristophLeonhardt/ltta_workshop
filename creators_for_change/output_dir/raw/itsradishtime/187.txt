and trying to solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems together</font>

35
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:28,140
one time the power went out in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,329
apartment that luke<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I shared</font>

together and we ran around lighting

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,930
little tea light candles everywhere and

39
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,189
putting them by mirrors to reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

40
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,799
light and cuddling up in blankets and

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,049
playing card games and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fun</font>

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:44,970
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everything's going to</font>

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,620
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

44
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,290

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,360
you going to get light and stay warm and

46
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,370

50
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,970
the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> as being totally</font>

00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,380
disconnected from all the distractions

52
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,280
and it's just quiet and pure and real

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,320
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something so comforting</font>

54
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:12,650
and cozy about knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>
