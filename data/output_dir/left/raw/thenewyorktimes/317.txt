1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
“This guy has got to
be the toughest guy

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,140
to take the kind of
abuse that he’s taking.”

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,810
“I have no idea who
these women are.”

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,039
“They said nothing happened.

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:09,960
Everybody said nothing happened.”

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,400
Well before the #MeToo movement
gained momentum,

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,990
Donald Trump weighed in
on allegations

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,990
against several well-known men,

9
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,150
including himself.

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:21,010
A look at his past
statements show a man

11
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,050
who’s quick to defend
other men.

12
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,710
“He says he’s innocent.

13
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,130
And I think you have to
remember that.”

14
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,850
The president recently vouched
for Rob Porter,

15
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,140
a White House aide
who is accused

16
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,180
of physical and verbal abuse
by two ex-wives.

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,700
Porter denies the allegations.

18
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,020
Trump also defended Roy Moore,

19
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,770
the former Republican
Alabama Senate candidate.

20
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,810
Moore is accused of
sexual misconduct

21
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,190
against teenage girls.

22
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,479
“Well, he denies it.

23
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,340
Look, he denies it.

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,170
I mean, if you look at
what is really going on,

25
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,310
and you look at all the things
that have happened

26
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:59,720
over the last 48 hours,
he totally denies it.”

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:03,010
President Trump then
campaigned for Moore.

28
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,030
“So get out and
vote for Roy Moore.”

29
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:10,540
Five women received settlements
after making harassment claims

30
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,580
against Fox News
host Bill O’Reilly.

31
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,710
He was later forced
off the network.

32
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,080
O’Reilly denied the allegations.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,520
This is what the president said.

34
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,850
“‘He’s a person I know well — he’s
a good person,’ adding,

35
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,770
‘I think he shouldn’t have settled.

36
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,000
I don’t think Bill
did anything wrong.’”

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,850
In 2016, a reporter accused
Trump’s former campaign manager

38
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:33,700
Corey Lewandowski
of grabbing and bruising

39
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,440
her arm at a campaign rally.

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,546
“A lot of people are
looking and saying,

41
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:38,670
how can anybody be charged?

42
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,240
He was — she was actually —
if you look at her,

43
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,200
my look at, and according to
a lot of —

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,750
she’s grabbing at me, 
and he’s acting as an intermediary

45
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,820
and trying to block
her from doing that.”

46
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,640
There have been moments when
Trump has come out against

47
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,740
men accused of sexual misconduct.

48
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,810
But it’s typically only happened
when they’re political rivals.

49
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,660
The president slammed
former Senator Al Franken,

50
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,750
a Democrat, after a photo
surfaced of him appearing

51
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,968
to grope a woman.

52
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,300
“The Al Frankenstein picture is really bad,
speaks a thousand words.

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,620
Where do his hands
go in pictures 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 ...”

54
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,090
Trump also criticized
Harvey Weinstein,

55
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,250
a major Democratic Party donor,
after allegations that he

56
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,110
engaged in rampant sexual
harassment and abuse.

57
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,560
“I’ve known Harvey Weinstein for a long time.

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,460
I’m not at all surprised to see it.”

59
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,300
And then there’s
the president, who has been

60
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,050
accused of sexual
misconduct by multiple women.

61
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,120
Like many of the
men he defends,

62
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Trump denies the allegations.

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,010
“Every woman lied when they
came forward to hurt my campaign.

64
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:50,640
Total fabrication.

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,620
The events never happened.

66
00:02:53,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Never.”
