1
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:13,568
When I’m spinning I feel calm.
Like, it relaxes me.

2
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:18,188
Especially when I’m doing the suicide
slide, it's like a stress reliever for me.

3
00:00:18,188 --> 00:00:24,862
And, the smell of burning tires just, I don’t
know, it just makes me feel so at home.

4
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:39,338
I actually just wanted to learn how to
drive. I mean, nobody wanted to teach

5
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:43,338
me because I was too young so I just got
into a car and started driving on my own.

6
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:50,524
Spinning was illegal, it was more
of a gangster sport.

7
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:53,768
People used to steal cars and
go and spin it.

8
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:58,672
Today spinning is more of a family sport.
We have controlled environments.

9
00:00:58,672 --> 00:01:03,618
It's now a legal sport in South Africa.
It’s now, part of our life,

10
00:01:03,618 --> 00:01:05,658
it’s part of our culture.

11
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:15,320
I don’t feel scared because, before
I go spinning, I get into my car and

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,748
I start praying, asking
God to keep me safe.

13
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:30,112
When I’m in that car, my face, it’s just,
you can’t explain the look on my face.

14
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,256
I feel like nobody can tell me
what to do, what to be.

15
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:39,414
I’m just being myself. And
that’s amazing because I feel

16
00:01:39,414 --> 00:01:42,656
like I’m on top of the world,
like I control everything.

17
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,832
I tried a new stunt, and I
ended up falling

18
00:01:47,832 --> 00:01:49,384
off the bonnet and getting hurt.

19
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:55,432
After I fell and got hurt, I decided that
I'm not going to let that stop me.

20
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:58,030
I got back up and I went back out

21
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,770
to show the world that
this is what I do for love.

22
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:11,960
I think it's very important for women to
experience feeling in control because at

23
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,334
that second it’s like the world is yours,
you can do whatever you want with it.

24
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:26,834
I plan on opening up a school for
spinning, and showing younger females

25
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:30,898
that you can spin, you can do
anything you set your mind to.

26
00:02:30,898 --> 00:00:00,000
I mean, the sky's the limit,
just do your best.
