IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL HAS SPARKED

4
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,017
ANGER AND REACTION IN TEHRAN.

EXPRESSING HOPE OF A NEW DEAL

13
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,303

00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:43,943
A GOOD DEAL.

A FAIR DEAL.

18

A GOOD DEAL BETTER FOR THEM, BUT

00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:53,086
WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO HAVE

SEVEN YEARS THEY COULD DO IT

56
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,903
THEY WANT.

57
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:17,704
MONEY.

58
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,471

DEVELOP BALLISTIC MISSILES, AND

IT'S TO OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

THREATEN THE REGION.

73
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:48,401
THAT'S WHY THE PRESIDENT WAS A

74
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:57,543
STRONG A BOLD MOVE.

77
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,512
THAT THE PRESIDENT MADE THE

78

WRONG DECISION THAT WILL INFLAME

FOR THE DECISION?

84
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:06,586
I THINK THE PRESIDENT SHOWED

85
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,154
LEADERSHIP AND WILL HELP HIM

86
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,124

REACHED.

100
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:37,650
JUST ANOTHER INDICATOR IT WAS A

101
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:47,927
BIG LIE.

102
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:48,428

108
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,501

START TO FEEL THE PRESSURE.

116
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:13,953
THEY'RE NOT HAPPY IN TEHRAN THIS

DID YOU EVER THINK YOU COULD SEE

191
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,335
THE DAY WHEN THE U.S. EMBASSY

192
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,169
WOULD BE MOST TO JERUSALEM, IT'S

193
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:43,803
BEEN PROMISED BEFORE.

194
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,071
>> IT'S AMAZING.

195
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,771
PRESIDENT TRUMP PROMISED IT

196
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:46,472
DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND HE'S

197
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:46,839
DOING IT.

198
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,941
IT'S A GREAT DAY FOR US IN

199
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,342
ISRAEL.

200
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,076
MORE COUNTRIES WILL FOLLOW THE

201
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,845
U.S. AND MOVE THERE AT TO SEE TO

202
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:59,385
JERUSALEM.

203
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:00,152
IT'S BEEN THE CAPITAL SINCE KING

204
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:00,453
DAVID.

205
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,187
BUT NOW THE UNITED STATES IS

206
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:01,888
RECOGNIZING JERUSALEM IS THE

207
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,856
CAPITAL IT WILL BE A BIG

208
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,058
CELEBRATION.

209
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:06,792
WE WILL ENJOY THE EVENTS WITH

210
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,728
DIGNITARIES.

211
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:12,798
IT'S VERY SYMBOLIC, A NEW

212
00:07:12,798 --> 00:07:13,332
EMBASSY COMING.

213
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,066
>> TALK ABOUT THE SYMBOLISM IN

214
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:18,571
THE MESSAGE TO THE MIDDLE EAST.

215
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,372
>> IF YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE PEACE,

216
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:20,072
YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC.

217
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:23,175
FOR DECADES WE HAVE SEEN MANY

218
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:23,943
COMING TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND

219
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:24,577
TRYING TO ACHIEVE WISHFUL

220
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:24,944
THINKING.

221
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:30,416
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS COMING,

222
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,618
EVERYBODY KNOWS -- SO HE SAYS

223
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,955
LET'S MOVE ON AND PUT IT ON THE

224
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:36,255
TABLE.

225
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,023
I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH

226
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,226
TO MOVE FORWARD.

227
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,862
HE'S GETTING MORE RESPECT IN THE

228
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:48,334
MIDDLE EAST.

229
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,068
>> ERIC: WHAT ABOUT CRITICS WHO

230
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:49,869
SAY IT IS PROVOCATIVE, THAT IT

231
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,370
WILL INCITE VIOLENCE AND ANGER

232
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:58,344
THE PALESTINIANS?

233
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,011
>> WE HAVE SEEN VIOLENCE,

234
00:07:59,011 --> 00:07:59,712
INCITEMENT ALL OVER, WITH ALL

235
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:07,086
THOSE INITIATIVES.

236
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:07,787
WE HAVE SEEN IT WITH OTHER

237
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:08,154
COUNTRIES.

238
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:08,921
WE BRING THEM CLOSER TO ISRAEL

239
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,722
AND HOPEFULLY BRING THEM BACK TO

240
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:10,156
THE TABLE.

241
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:20,299
>> TO THINK THIS COALITION OF

242
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,267
ALLIES IN ISRAEL HAVE BEEN

243
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,101
HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WILL

244
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:22,835
AFFECT THE PEACE PROCESS, I DO

245
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:28,874
YOU SEE A SOLUTION?

246
00:08:28,874 --> 00:08:29,508
>> WE CAN ACHIEVE PEACE.

247
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:30,276
WE SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH EGYPT

248
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,745
AND JORDAN.

249
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:37,482
WE DON'T SEE IT TODAY BUT WE DO

250
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:38,417
SEE -- WE WANT THEM TO COME HELP

251
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:45,224
US AND MAYBE WITH THEIR SUPPORT

252
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:45,825
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.

253
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:46,592
>> ERIC: IN YOUR MESSAGE TO THE

254
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:51,030
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY?

255
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,597
>> STOP THE VIOLENCE.

256
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:52,398
DON'T SAID THE KIDS TO BE HUMAN

257
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,100
SHIELDS, COME BACK TO NEGOTIATE.

258
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,268
>> ERIC: THANK YOU FOR COMING

259
00:08:56,268 --> 00:00:00,000
TONIGHT.
