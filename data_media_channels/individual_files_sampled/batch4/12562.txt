the Democrats again they they cannot stop with the over-the-top rhetoric about Trump they just can't help themselves they have to go over-the-top on every element so here is Whoopi Goldberg talking about Donald Trump and it's not just that she disagrees with what Trump is doing Donald Trump is now you guessed it the Taliban we have a leader who is repeatedly to demean women right wants to different organizations that benefit women calling on the media to shut up specifically wants to give preferential treatment based on religion are these values really much different than the Taliban I mean yes they are it turns out that Donald Trump is not the Taliban he's not in favor of honor killings Donald's right in fact it's to stop the Taliban from coming in the country that he's implementing some of these immigration policies that is the basic idea behind all of this and I'd be very surprised if in the future his immigration moratorium does not extend to Afghanistan hey the fact is Donald Trump's entire stated purpose with regard to stopping an influx of immigrants from countries like Yemen and Somalia is because he doesn't want the culture of certain areas of the world infiltrating what he means by that is radical Islam it's not a Muslim ban because radical Islam and Islam are not the same thing but it is an attempt to fight the infiltration of radical Islam into the West so no Donald Trump is not like the Taliban the idea that Donald Trump is the Taliban because he is at least in policy pro-life the idea that Donald Trump is the Taliban because Donald Trump doesn't want me to pay for your contraceptives the idea that Donald Trump is the Taliban because Donald Trump is undertaking immigration reform that is in large part moderate I mean it really is again of the ten most populous Muslim countries on earth nine of them are still able to send whoever they want to the United States citizens from those countries can enter and there gonna be lots of exceptions to Donald Trump's new immigration policy the Democrats cannot help themselves the left has to they have to portray Donald Trump and Satan more than Satan and there is there is something here that I think is kind of fascinating and that is on both sides on both sides of the aisle there's a tendency to attribute to the other side some sort of masterful genius so on the left instead of them just saying Donald Trump kind of incompetent doing some things I don't like me right which if you're a leftist that's sort of what you would be saying if you're a relatively rational leftist at this point Donald Trump is doing things I don't like but man he really doesn't even know what he's doing I mean this is pretty incompetent that's that's what if I were on the left that's what I would be saying at this point but instead of doing that they have to attribute to Donald Trump Satanic all-knowing power donald trump is secretly the taliban he's secretly Hitler he secretly has a plan to take over everything and run it right and on the right we used to do the same thing with Obama it wasn't just that Obama was incompetent in the rollout of Obamacare it was all part of his evil plan right everything that that Obama did was all part was all part of the plan right it was it was all part of this evil evil plan here's the truth most of the people in government suck at their jobs because most people in America suck at their jobs most adults suck at everything okay the great lie of being an adult is that other adults know what they're doing they generally don't we all sort of muddle through and then we hope for the best the same is true in government because we attribute this level of mastery to government we think it matters so much who heads the government and when someone we like is in charge we want that person to have more power because after all if he's our side we think he's the master of the universe right so when Donald Trump watch this this executive order roll out he had people saying it's for DHS it's for T just know it's not for T chest okay if it's for T chest it's the kind of for T chest like in Star Wars where you don't play chess with the wookie because he gets mad and rips out your arms right it's not actually Donald Trump playing four-dimensional chess in time right that's not what's going on here but because there are so many people who have a religious belief that our leaders know what they're doing they say give them more power they know what they're doing it hasn't been true for a hundred years we've muddled through anyway but it hasn't been true for a hundred years you want to actually have a better country stop treating the people in government as though they're experts and know what they're doing all the time with evil plans or good plans and just say you know what whether evil whether they're good let's just cut the power of government totally and then it won't matter because they're incompetent in won't matter if they're evil won't matter if they're good they can't do anything right what I would prefer is if we treated Washington DC like it was the DMV and took as much power away as humanly possible okay this is this everybody is trying to turn Donald Trump and Darth Vader on the left and on the right everybody tried to turn Barack Obama and Siddharth Vader and I listen I think Obama was in many ways more competent than Trump is at a lot of things and I think he had more plans than Trump does I think Trump is pretty ad hoc but but but Obama wasn't in charge of things either it turns out very few people are actually Darth Vader very few people are actually capable of being Darth Vader and so that means that we should actually take power away from them and the if you're really that worried about Darth Vader by the way on the left if you're really that worried about Donald Trump ings Darth Vader how about this instead of him running the Empire let's downsize the umpire so it's just the most Isley DMV and then you don't have to worry about it that'd be the easiest way to fix this problem
