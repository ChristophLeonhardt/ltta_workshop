1
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:05,671
WELCOME BACK.

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:08,374
THE BATTLE OVER BRETT

3
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:12,211
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HAS

4
00:00:12,211 --> 00:00:12,678
DIVIDED THE U.S.

5
00:00:12,678 --> 00:00:14,013
I SHOULD NEVER SAY POLITICAL

6
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:14,780
OPPONENTS SHOULD ROT IN HELL

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:18,384
OR WHATEVER THE PHRASE WAS BUT

8
00:00:18,384 --> 00:00:19,085
IT IS HARD TO MAINTAIN

9
00:00:19,085 --> 00:00:20,653
STABILITY IN THE WAY THAT THE

10
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:21,887
DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BEHAVED

11
00:00:21,887 --> 00:00:22,822
IN THIS.

12
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:29,228
JOINING US NOW, HE HAS A

13
00:00:29,228 --> 00:00:31,297
BRILLIANT BOOK OUT LATER WHICH

14
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,264
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT, BUT

15
00:00:32,264 --> 00:00:33,466
I WOULD LOVE YOUR TAKE ON ALL

16
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,201
THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE SUCH AN

17
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,003
INTERESTING COMMENTATOR.

18
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,372
WHERE YOU THINK THIS LEAVES

19
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:49,482
US, THIS WHOLE LAST FEW WEEKS

20
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:50,349
TWO I THINK IT LEAVES US

21
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:51,183
BROAD, ANGRY AND MORE DIVIDED

22
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:51,551
THAN EVER.

23
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,385
ONE OF THE IRONY OF THE STORY,

24
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,052
SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T HEARD

25
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:53,886
MUCH TALK ABOUT IS THAT BRETT

26
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:54,587
KAVANAUGH IS A CONSERVATIVE

27
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:55,288
WHO FLOURISHED IN LIBERAL

28
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,689
INSTITUTIONS AT YALE, AT YELL

29
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,025
LAW SCHOOL, HE IS SOMEONE WHO

30
00:00:59,025 --> 00:00:59,692
HAD NUMEROUS DEMOCRATS COME

31
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:02,562
OUT AND DEFEND HIM EARLY ON

32
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,162
THIS PROCESS.

33
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:06,366
HE ROUTINELY HIRED LIBERAL

34
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:09,302
STUDENTS WHO PRAISE HIM AND

35
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,803
WORKED TO SUPPORT HIS

36
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:13,940
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME

37
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,308
COURT.

38
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:16,109
HE IS VERY MUCH AN

39
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:16,776
ESTABLISHMENT CONSERVATIVE,

40
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:17,744
SOMEONE WHO IS ALWAYS WORKING

41
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,445
ACROSS THE AISLE, TRYING TO

42
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:27,720
BUILD BRIDGES.

43
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,621
HIS PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON THE

44
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:29,389
IDEA THAT WE MUST ALLOW

45
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,123
DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATORS TO TAKE

46
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,825
THE LEAD.

47
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,061
FRED WHAT DID HE GET?

48
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,865
HE WAS TRYING TO BUILD BRIDGES

49
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:39,399
AND DOING SO MUCH.

50
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,435
HE WAS LITERALLY HIRED AS A

51
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,836
LECTURER BY ELENA KAGAN,

52
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:47,340
ANOTHER SUPREME COURT

53
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,673
JUSTICE.

54
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:49,409
SHE HIRED HIM AND WENT OUT OF

55
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,345
HER WAY BECAUSE SHE SO

56
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,179
RESPECTED HIM AS A JOURNALIST

57
00:01:53,179 --> 00:01:54,013
AND A THINKER.

58
00:01:54,013 --> 00:02:02,655
THEN SUDDENLY SOMEONE WHO

59
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:03,656
DEVOTED SO MUCH OF HIS LIFE TO

60
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:04,357
BUILDING THESE BRIDGES, THIS

61
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:05,058
IS WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES.

62
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:05,625
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY

63
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:05,992
TESTAMENT.

64
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:06,592
WHEN YOU LOOK TO BRETT

65
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:07,293
KAVANAUGH TESTIMONY, IN A WAY

66
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:07,927
YOU SEE SOMEONE WHO SAID

67
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:08,428
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

68
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:11,097
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS SOMEONE

69
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:11,798
WHO BUILT GENUINE FRIENDSHIP.

70
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,465
I THOUGHT I WAS SOMEONE WHO

71
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,735
BUILT AND CULTIVATED THIS

72
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,436
TRUST WITH FOLKS ON THE

73
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:19,372
LIBERAL LEFT.

74
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:20,040
INSTEAD YOU HAVE THIS

75
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,640
EXPERIENCE THAT FOR HIM

76
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,409
MUST'VE BEEN SO FEARING YOU

77
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:23,977
SEE THIS HAPPENING TOO SO MANY

78
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,547
CONSERVATIVES RIGHT NOW.

79
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:28,281
PEOPLE WHO FELT THEY HAND

80
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,616
BRIDGE THESE DIVIDES AND NOW

81
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:33,019
FEELING PERHAPS THAT'S NOT THE

82
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:33,386
CASE.

83
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,455
>> I HAD THAT FEELING THIS

84
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:35,755
WEEK.

85
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:40,827
I HAD THAT FEELING THIS WEEK.

86
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,161
>> LOOK.

87
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,828
STEVE, OBVIOUSLY, I AM MAD.

88
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:45,231
I'VE BEEN HONEST ABOUT THIS

89
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,366
ALL WEEK AND THE ONLY THING I

90
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,100
AGREE WITH WHAT RICHARD SAID

91
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,869
IS THIS IS ABOUT MERRICK

92
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,237
GARLAND AND POLITICAL

93
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:51,938
RETRIBUTION FOR DEMOCRATS AND

94
00:02:51,938 --> 00:02:54,207
WHAT DISTURBS ME IS THEY ARE

95
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:54,874
WILLING TO DRIVE SOMEONE'S

96
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:56,376
NAME AND HIS FAMILY THROUGH

97
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,944
THE MUD WITHOUT ZERO EVIDENCE

98
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,779
OF OR ANY CORROBORATING

99
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,748
EVIDENCE AND THAT DOESN'T

100
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:07,387
MATTER TO THEM.

101
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,121
DEMOCRATS WERE ALREADY AGAINST

102
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:08,989
HIM BEFORE HE WAS NAMED FRED

103
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:09,889
WHAT ABOUT DUE PROCESS?

104
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,660
WHAT ABOUT HIS FAMILY?

105
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,427
I FIND IT DISTURBING AND

106
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,228
DESPICABLE THE MY CLIENTS ARE

107
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:16,663
WILLING TO DO THIS.

108
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,901
DON'T TRY TO SAY THEY HAVE

109
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:21,601
POLITICS, THE TERM BOARDGAME

110
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:25,939
COMES FROM THE DEMOCRATIC

111
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:27,074
PARTY.

112
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,108
I'VE SEEN THIS IN MY OWN TIME

113
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:32,246
WORKING ON CAMPAIGNS AND THE

114
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,113
LENGTHS THEY ARE WILLING TO GO

115
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:33,814
TO TRY TO HURT SOMEONE

116
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,214
CLINICALLY.

117
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:34,915
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S

118
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:35,616
LIFE WITH TWO YOUNG GIRLS AT

119
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:37,417
HOME AND A WIFE WHOSE HE HAD

120
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,720
TO EXPLAIN THIS TO END THE

121
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,424
STORIES THAT WERE BROUGHT TO

122
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:44,992
THE SURFACE, THE ZERO

123
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:45,592
CORROBORATING EVIDENCE.

124
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,293
THERE'S NOT A SINGLE WITNESS

125
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:47,027
THAT WILL STEP FORWARD AND SAY

126
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,061
IS TRUE.

127
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,663
>> DOCTOR FORD ALSO HAS A

128
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,098
FAMILY.

129
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:55,035
>> WHY WAS SHE IN THE

130
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:55,435
SPOTLIGHT.

131
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:57,538
THAT'S A RIDICULOUS POINT.

132
00:03:57,538 --> 00:04:01,875
THE REASON DOCTOR FORD AND HER

133
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,010
FAMILY HAS TO SUFFER WAS THE

134
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,179
CHOICE OF THE DEMOCRATS.

135
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:06,847
>> STEVE, WAIT A MINUTE.

136
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:08,916
>> THEY COULD'VE MADE IT, THEY

137
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,250
COULD'VE HANDLED ALL THIS

138
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,718
PRIVACY.

139
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:17,925
>> YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE

140
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,661
ANGRY TWO DOCTOR FORD HAS

141
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,596
EVERY REASON TO BE ANGRY AT

142
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,063
YOUR PARTY.

143
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:23,530
>> CAN I FINISH.

144
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,298
BOTH OF YOU HAVE REASON TO BE

145
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:24,665
ANGRY.

146
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:25,399
>> AM I GOING TO BE ABLE TO

147
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,066
MAKE A POINT QUEST MARK.

148
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:26,667
>> WITH YOUR PARTY.

149
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,434
>> YOU HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE

150
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:33,207
ANGRY BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE.

151
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:33,607
[INAUDIBLE]

152
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,208
WE HAVE HAD HUNDRED 13

153
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:34,808
DIFFERENT SUPREME COURT

154
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:35,442
JUSTICES GO THROUGH THIS

155
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,143
PROCESS AND MAKE IT AND NOT

00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:39,380
ONE, NOT EVEN CLARENCE THOMAS

157

158
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,149
BRETT KAVANAUGH DID IN THIS.

>> IN RESPONSE TO WHAT

160
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:49,857
HAPPENED TO HIM FROM YOUR

PARTY.

162

>> CLARENCE THOMAS DIDN'T EVEN

163
00:04:51,158 --> 00:04:51,658
INVOKED POLITICS.

164
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,359
THE SUPREME COURT SHOULD BE

165
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:56,230
ABOVE POLITICAL APPROACH NO

166
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,867
MATTER WHOSE IN CHARGE OF THE

SENATE OR THE HOUSE.

168

>> HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT.

169
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:03,337
IT'S NOT EVEN WORTH HAVING A

170
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:03,737
DISCUSSION.

171
00:05:03,737 --> 00:05:04,305
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

172
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,039
>> THAT'S WHERE THE MIDDLE OF

173
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,674
AMERICA IS SPREAD.

174
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,242
THIS IS AMERICA.

175
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:11,579
THAT'S THE REASON WHY TWO

176
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:12,146
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

177
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,948
>> THE PROBLEM ISN'T WITH

178
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:16,484
DEMOCRATS.

GUILTY AND NOW BECAUSE HE'S

182

ANGRY BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS

183
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:24,925
