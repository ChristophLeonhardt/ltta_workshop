so that they know that we sent you as well okay so yesterday President Trump goes to Texas and the reason that we have politicians go to these places is because if we don't then the media suggests that they're bad people that's how this game works when george w bush did a flyover of hurricane katrina back in 2006-2007 then the media went nuts how dare george w bush do such a thing how could George W Bush not actually land in New Orleans and and take care of business on the ground like I always thought this was stupid because I'm not sure exactly why it is it certainly 2005 I'm not sure why it is that the George W Bush what was he gonna do on the ground was he gonna like get out and start bailing I was he gonna go to a homeless shelter and start handing out food in a way that no other two human hands on the planet could do it seems like a massive distraction to me whenever a president does this it seemed like a distraction when Obama wanted to do this during Hurricane sandy and then Chris Christie hosted him in New Jersey I'm not a big fan of this whole the president has to go there like he's the king like he's the Emperor and he must land and now he will bring order to a chaotic situation like did anyone feel more secure the Trump went that's not a rip on Trump that's a rip on the system Trump did what he had to do he went there because if he hadn't then the media would have ripped him up and down so naturally the media focused on a couple of aspects of this that are completely irrelevant the federal response to hurricane Harvey has been quite good so far there's been no evidence that the feds have been asleep on the job not sleep at the switch the state response has been quite good the city response the local response has been quickly everybody did what they've been doing which is why you have this historic flooding in Houston and I believe we're still in single digits as far as the number of people who are dead which every one of those a tragedy but let's be real if this flood happened in a third-world country to be talked about tens of thousands of people dead not I think it's now six individuals dead in this in this lighting seven individuals dead by the time it's over I'm sure there'll be a couple of dozen people who died but that is a testament to the emergency services and the capacity of the government to to help out in situations like this but is that what the media are focused on no they're focused on all the optics because whenever Trump is attending place it's all about the optics Oh Trump arrives and he's wearing his USA hat because that's what he does and Melania all of the focuses are Melania in terms of a lot of the optics so the first focus was on the fact that when she was lead the white house she was wearing heels okay so she then changed on the plane and she was wearing sneakers when she got there which makes him sense but why do we care about her shoes again just confused as to that who knows she was wearing heels zach braff of scrubs fame said that he wanted to dress in milania's heels for halloween you undo Milania going to a disaster zone for Halloween and then Milania shows up and she looked beautiful because she's a beautiful woman and she's wearing a hat that says on it FLOTUS as his First Lady of the United States so you've got Trump wearing his us a hat and she's wearing a hat that says who she is which I got to admit I'm never a huge fan of this particular look when when it would like it would be the equivalent of me wearing a ben shapiro thug-life hat around like he's just like if you don't know who Milania is she's the wife of the president like did you pick up on that so not my favorite thing but is it a big deal of course it's not a big deal like seriously that's the big deal so Trump arrives and Trump talks about the cleanup in Texas okay so there's nothing wrong with that people were saying this is all self aggrandizing okay have you never met Trump have you never seen the guy like still the hell what is the job getting Gunners the job not getting done and then what they really jumped on is he shows up at basically it looks like a truck yard in in Corpus Christi and he explained and he starts sort of pitching himself as as a public figure he talked about the crowd right he talks about crowd size this is Trump's shtick okay if you don't get it by now then you're never gonna get it this is what Trump does thank you everybody what a crowd what a turnout I want to thank our governor has done who's right here somebody's right here so we just want to thank your governor senator Cruz to the cordon okay so everybody in media goes nuts over this how could he say what a crowd how could he say what a turnout why is his focus on the crowd in the turnout okay I admit it's uncouth does anyone really care is this the biggest deal oh what a crowd like that's what we're gonna that's what I'm gonna nitpick over now he's doing a good job with the response but that's what we're gonna nitpick over and then they double down because Trump also said that this is all about you know how it's gonna be that he wants people to be able to congratulate each other when this is over on their response again is this a big deal we won't say congratulations we don't want to do that yeah Greg Abbott looking real awkward there and so the media of course decide that this is just insane because really the story here is not Trump's capacity and his administration's capacity to handle a disaster hey let's be real about this for one second okay a month ago if you would have said there's a major disaster on American soil do you think the Trump administration can handle it the media would universally have said no not've said he's understaffed he doesn't know it he's doing he's a buffoon and the handling of this has been pretty good and a handling this has been pretty smooth so instead what the media choose to focus on is empathy they choose to focus on feelings Trump you see wasn't empathetic enough here's a little montage cut by our own Robert Cray check over at daily wire of all the members of the media focusing in on just the horrific nature of Trump's statements how could he not be more empathetic where is the man's empathy where are his feelings where is his heart and briefly to Donald Trump have his empathy moment today he didn't have the empathy moment yet but he's done a very good job except for asking or complimenting the crowd sighs that came out to greet him anything up if he's never been his strong suit hug a mom or hold a baby or shake someone's hand or ask a senior how they were doing it was really remarkable he acted like this was a big field trip and it was the biggest and the best response and we're gonna congratulate each other later it was typical Donald Trump was that without an ounce of them but is he ever been exposed to a situation and Jim those words there show that the president is still very much learning on the job in terms of empathy learning on jobs on the job in terms of how to react and relate to the individuals here who are the human element seem to be absent outside of the self congratulatory gestures of the press conference it seems to me it's just concerned about optics just concerned about optics and I want to be concerned well wish they would be concerned about people they were saying that it's going to be key to see the way he has real feelings and real empathy how does he respond in this first big situation like this what will you be looking for the empathy factor there's the response there as making people feel like he's engaged and he's going to be Alicia's what present property is trying to convey today in his visit and appropriately so he is going to have to show some real feeling some real empathy to the people in Texas that have been hit in this devastating manner in that way it remains to be seen what the empathy factor is going to be on message yeah I think he understands things around message can we stop it there because he just goes on and on you think they're on message about the empathy thing okay so a couple of things are worth noting here one President Trump does not have to be an actor okay we're not sitting here evaluating whether he should be cast in the role of Iago or whether he should be cast as Desdemona okay with it's not important the this whole presidents have to show empathy routine I'm a big fan of Calvin Coolidge because Calvin Coolidge didn't truck with this BS Calvin Coolidge was basically look here's my job I'm gonna do my job and then I'm gonna go play golf like this isn't his woman to do I'm gonna do it I'm gonna go back in my room I'm not gonna bother you it's not important for me to get on the radio it's not important for me to be a public figure but now we have to do this whole well he didn't shed a tear I remember during the Obama administration after there was some there was an actor there's some gun violence Massacre there was a massacre using a gun and Obama went out and did a press conference and he said it's here with me oh my god look at the feelings of him look how much he feels he feels for you he feels for me he's just Jesus like in his feeling for everyone this routine where if Trump would just show a little more empathy the media would be on his side are you kidding they'd find something else to nitpick I mean Melania released a statement yesterday and here's what it said it said the effects of Hurricane Harvey will be felt in Texas Louisiana and other parts of the country for many months and years to come so far 1.7 million people are under orders to evacuate their homes and as the flood water in Houston Rises sadly so will the number of evacuees I want to be able to offer my help and support in the most productive way possible not through just words but also action what I found through the most profound during the visit was not only the strength and resilience of the people of Texas but the compassion and sense of community that has taken over the state my thoughts and prayers continue to be with the people of the Texas in Louisiana it seems rather empathetic to me but the overall drive for empathy I think is actually a serious political problem for a couple of reasons and I'll explain those in just one second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at stamps.com so are you tired of waiting in line at the post office you don't have time to run over to the grocery store and get the stamps don't know how to weigh

that's pretty amazing go over to stamps calm in that four-week trial plus postage and digital scale stamps comments our promo code Shapiro never go to the post office again again use that promo code Shapiro also that they know that we sent you okay so here is I have two specific problems with this whole empathy routine from the media number three one is that it's obviously hypocritical the media doesn't care about Trump's level of empathy they have a goal which is to paint him as uncaring and mean right the Democrats constantly Democrats in the media they have a three pronged attack on people in in Republican halls of power they are stupid they are corrupt or they are evil so they've already tried stupid with Trump and it's only gotten them so far corrupt they're they're still trying and it's only gotten them so far so now in this situation where he's demonstrated in either stupidity nor corruption they have to go to their third prong which is he's evil he actually doesn't empathize with the people who are in harm's way like really do you really think that Trump at night he's just gonna screw those people in Texas screw them I'm so glad there's a flood do you really think that's who Trump is because that would really be evil I don't think that's who Trump is you may be oblivious he may be a buffoon sometimes but is that what you're seeing here because that's not what I'm seeing here and the media are obviously attempting to exaggerate the case and make a case that he's a meaning a big meanie even though he's doing the job and specifically because he's doing the job okay second point here and but the in politics actually makes for bad policy it makes for bad policy as I've referenced before empathy in politics leads you to have empathy for the person who's directly in front of you without looking at the broader cost so empathy leads you to a situation like hurricane sandy where after Hurricane sandy Democrats in Congress decided they wanted to load up the hurricane sandy funding with a bunch of pork I loaded up a pork I was there I remember okay we all remember this chris Christie is now denying this that's because chris Christie is totally full of it the fact is they did load up the hurricane sandy bill of pork why because they were using empathy as an excuse to be corrupt so we empathize with the people who are harmed by Hurricane sandy and therefore it is very very important that we load up as much pork into this bill as possible and pass something and if you don't do it then you lack empathy then you are a bad person empathy leads you to focus on the specific beneficiary of a policy as opposed to the disparate and diffuse group of individuals who are hurt by a given policy so in this particular case listen we have FEMA we have a state government we have local governments and they're all doing their job but the idea here from the Democrats is that empathy really has to come down to how much money is Trump going to spend not does the job get done but we can measure empathy in dollars we can measure empathy in dollars which is sort of an amazing thing for Democrats to say considering that people who give charity in this country happen to be mostly Republican the average amount of charity coming out of Republican households is much higher than it is coming out of Democratic households but then we're called selfish okay if you're gonna measure empathy and money I would suggest you start with charity but for Democrats what they really mean is that if you're truly empathetic you're ready to sign a check to the government because the government can cure all your problems if you just give your cash to the government so for instance I saw a headline today that was talking about school lunches in Houston apparently the local government is now saying that they want to provide free school lunches to all the kids in Houston for 2017-2018 ok that's their prerogative but then I saw a tweet from a Democrat saying this is what Republicans have been fighting against all over the country number one the entire country was not just hit by 51 inches of rain and people didn't lose you know millions of homes presumably number two you know those school lunches let's I want to be clear about something private charity fills a lot of the gap for this sort of stuff you know much money the Red Cross is taken in since the beginning of this hurricane I mean it's an enormous sum of money it's it truly is you can tell where that where a lot of the left's sort of priorities lie Linda Sarsour has now put out a tweet calling for people to donate to what she's calling the hurricane Harvey Relief Fund the hurricane Harvey Relief Fund is apparently and reportedly a political organizing committee that is designed toward lobbying the government it's not actually charity that goes directly to victims it is instead of social organizing force to get people to lobby the government to give more money to the victims of Hurricane Harvey and to in particular minority groups who are harmed by hurricane Harvey it just demonstrates where the left head is at in all of this so second reason why I don't like the empathy argument is that the empathy argument suggests that you are somehow a better person if you spend more money empathy is really a stand-in for cash empathy is just a politically savvy maneuver by Democrats in order for them to claim that you're not empathetic enough if you don't want to give them what they want they're like this all the time right this is what I said to Piers Morgan about gun control his implication was if I didn't want gun control it's because I wasn't empathetic enough for Democrats you can measure the level of your effectiveness by the level of your empathy I don't measure effectiveness by empathy I'm as your effectiveness by effectiveness I measure empathy by empathy and I honestly don't care that much what's in your heart I can much more about what you do so those are the first two reasons why this empathy schpeel is wrong one is the democrats in the media are being hypocritical about it this is all ruse second when they say empathy what they really mean is spending lots and lots of government money that's the second reason that this empathy nonsense is is wrong and the third reason is because obviously - misdirection away from from what's going on with Trump they won't give Trump credit and so instead they decide to focus on the empathy question oh if only he'd shown his heart oh if only he had gone and he'd wept oh if only he'd there is something to the idea that if you go into a chaotic situation and rather than demonstrating that you care you demonstrate that you're in control that's actually more useful if I were a victim of some sort of natural disaster what I wouldn't care very much about is a politician coming in and giving me a hug or my wife a hug I don't need a hug I have a wife for that and what I would care about is the politician coming in and saying here's what I'm going to do to take care of this right if I were a victim on the ground what I'd want from Greg Abbott and Donald Trump is not oh I care so much about you oh I care so much what I'd want is action that was effective and that's actually what we're seeing in this circumstance so again the empathy thing is a ruse it's used by the media in order to promote a particular policy agenda don't buy into it don't buy into what the left is doing here because the fact is Trump is doing a good job here and I haven't seen any evidence to the contrary and Trump is always gonna be Trump he's never gonna say the thing you want him to say but is that a huge deal ask the people of Texas the ones who are actually being harmed did they look up in arms and one of my favorite things about that clip of the people shouting back from about the Jeff Zeleny at CNN talking about Trump being non empathetic one of my favorite things the guy in the background shouting CNN fake news as this happens pretty amazing but I think indicative of the difference between the political viewpoints okay so I also want to talk about what disaster shows us about the roles of different kinds of human beings I want to talk about Nancy Pelosi making a statement that actually was really necessary oh and give you an update on Berkeley the Berkeley administration still throwing up roadblocks to this event it's amazing we'll talk about that and what they can do to facilitate and also I want to talk about this Nashville statement that the media are going nuts over so

we are the largest and fastest-growing conservative podcast in the nation all righty so let's talk a little bit about what Hurricane Katrina does in terms of reinforcing reality one of the reasons I think people like disaster fiction one of the reasons I think people like to watch movies like The Hunger Games is because we have an innate sense than when we are in crisis our true identity shines forth then when crisis strikes people go back to the basics and that's what you're seeing in Hurricane Katrina I talked about the in hurricane Harvey well as I talked about a couple of days ago I think that what you're seeing in terms of people helping each other out that is the innate sense of Americans I think that people all over the world want to help each other out in times of disaster but there is something else that I think is worth noting and that is there been a couple of pictures that I think people find really moving and to moving for a reason there's one picture in particular that I thought was very moving his picture of a man holding a woman holding a child he's trying to bring her out of the flood and he's holding the woman and she's holding the child the fact is the gender roles are relatively well defined in biology and the reason for that is because the diversity of the gender role is a great thing it's so funny the left is very into diversity except when it comes to actual gender roles then all of a sudden they suggest that these are all arbitrary and meaningless but the fact is that when disaster strikes it is largely men who are charging into situations to try and save women and children and other people okay a society that is not built on men trying to help each other will be built on men trying to destroy each other male gender roles that are all about men protecting yeah that's a good thing that's something we ought to be cheering and you see some people who are very upset when you say this oh how dare you there are women out there too hot that's true there are women who are out there helping for sure and no one's denying that and no one is deriding them helping but if a man is not protective if we have a society of men who are not protective they will instead be destructive this is just how we from the time boys are little boys they're either building with blocks or they are destroying the blocks that they just built these are the two things that they do men are built for protection or they are built for destruction and when you see disaster strike what you see is a lot of heroic men charging into the line of fire and that's a good thing and what you see is a lot of heroic women protecting their children he said a lot of heroic women whose first priority is to protect their kids and you see that kids are treated as kids innocents to be protected not children to be manipulated for political purposes not children free and capable of making their own decisions about life but small human beings who must be protected because they're innocent and aren't capable of taking care of themselves that is a good thing these are all good things the male role as protector is a good thing and something worth celebrating the female role the female role as guardian of the family as guardian of the children that is a good thing it's not a bad thing and I don't know why women would want to give that up honest to god I don't and this is not coming from someone who says that all women have to stay in the home lately I've been spending more time at home that my wife hasn't mean she's she's a medical resident but when when push comes to shove my job is to protect my wife and my wife's job is to protect my children and she knows that and I know that and a society that's not built on this innate biological Drive is death to fail the left strive to destroy all three parts of that it's really horrifying to say that men they're not really protectors they're just they're they're dispensable men are dispensable and women suggesting well you know it's not really our job to take care of children children can take care of themselves star job to work and left is suggesting the children are capable of making their own decisions about sexual orientation and gender identity you know all of this is a is an overriding of the of the innate biological good diversity between men women and children that truly does exist okay speaking of all of that I want to talk a little bit about the National statement so for people who don't know what the National statement is the evangelical community has brought out something called the Nashville statement okay on Friday August 25th the council on Biblical manhood and womanhood in the ethics and religious liberty commission jointly hosted a gathering of Christian leaders in Nashville they wanted to finalize and approve the National statement in the hope of providing a biblically faithful standard is according to desire in god org and the nashville statement has made a lot of fuss there are a lot of people on the Left who are very deeply upset with the National statement because the national statement does something terrible it reinforces all of biblical Christianity's views about sexuality oh it's always really weird and curious to me that so many folks on the Left are confused whenever Christians believe in the gospel whenever Jews believe in the Bible like that's the definition guys Lauren Zuka who's just adult oh she writes for Teen Vogue which means that she is one of our nation's preeminent public intellectuals she tweeted out that if Jesus were alive today he'd be turning water into wine and gay weddings no he most assuredly would not no he most assuredly would not read a book a book not like many books like Reed Grover goes to school and you'll be more informed about the Bible than you currently are clearly because this is insanity okay so here's what the National statement says this is not to suggest that public policy has to reflect the National statement but public policy does have to reflect protection for people who are religious and believe in the National statement that is something public policy does have to do you don't have to agree with the National statement but for you to try and hijack somebody else's religion is ridiculous it's like every time the Pope comes down says portions bad and left goes oh darn it we thought this time he was really gonna come around on this or when the Pope says same-sex marriage is not something that hath like church believes in and left goes we were this close no you weren't that close again it's been Catholic doctrine since the very beginning so the National statement affirms that God has designed marriage to be covenant all sexual procreative lifelong union of one man and one woman as husband and wife if this comes as a shock to you it's because you're stupid and they deny that God has designed marriage to be a homosexual polygamists or polyamorous and they deny marriage is a mere human contract rather than Covenant made with God I agree with all of this by the way on a personal level again this doesn't reflect public policy I think the government should get completely out of the business of marriage I agree it is a covenant made before God I don't know what government has to do with a covenant made before God article two says we affirm that God's revealed will for all people is chastity outside of marriage and fidelity within marriage okay again agreed I was a virgin until marriage so is my wife they say we deny that any affections desires or commitments ever justify sexual intercourse before or outside marriage nor do they justify any form of sexual immorality okay again this is a basic Christian worldview a basic judeo-christian worldview actually the idea that just because you want to do something doesn't mean you get to do something or that it's justified they say we affirm that God created Adam and Eve the first human beings in his own image equal before God as persons and distinct is male and female and deny that the divinely ordained differences between male and female render them unequal in dignity or worth again this is all just rote stuff this is thought there's no big deal here they say we affirm the differences between male and female reproductive structures are integral to God's design for self conception as male or female so in other words gender is not independent of sex again this is right they say we affirm that those born with a physical disorder of sex development are created in the image of God and have dignity and worth equal to all other image bearers we have firm that self conception as male or female should be defined by God's holy purposes in creation and redemption as revealed in Scripture and they say they deny that adopting a homosexual or transgender self conception is consistent with God's holy purposes in creation and redemption okay again this is traditional Christian worldview this is not suggesting that you're here here's where I still have a slight difference you know if you conceive of yourself as homosexual or transgender in my view that's your or orientations your business your action is God's business and and the religious communities business how you orient is up to you because desires are desires this is I think a significant difference actually between Christian thought and Jewish thought Jewish thought is very little about what you think and very much about what you do and Christian thought is very much about what you feel as well as what you do so this is difference but to suggest that this isn't in line with Christian thinking for the last couple thousand years is just asinine you know this is everything they say here in other words is is totally within the bounds of Christianity and yet the left is Superman because the left is Superman that there are people who disagree with them tolerance and diversity for the left end at my religious my religious observance that's when tolerance and diversity and which is why government has a job protecting religious diversity it's why government has a job saying you don't get to encroach on me and I don't get to encroach on you but this idea that you get to encroach on me because you don't like what I'm doing okay it's fascism and the left left hatred for the National statement demonstrates like I don't understand why they even care as I said I've said this a thousand times whether I consider your behavior sinful or not it's completely irrelevant to you why do you care what I think it's a free country feel free not to care but the left does care because deep down what the left wants when it comes to social issues is legitimacy moral legitimacy for their viewpoints they can't get it from the church they look to government to quash the church and then look to government as the sort of absolve err of all of their sexual feelings okay so in other news I want to talk a little bit about the latest on the antifa Berkeley situation because it continues to unfold so the so Nancy Pelosi did something I thought was actually quite good shockingly she has now released a statement it says our democracy has no room for inciting violence or endangering the public no matter the ideology of those who commit such acts the violent actions of people calling themselves an Tifa in berkeley this weekend deserve unequivocal condemnation and the perpetrator should be arrested and prosecutors prosecuted in california as across all of our great nation we have deep reverence for the constitutional right to peaceful dissent and free speech non-violence is fundamental to that right let us use the sad event to reaffirm that we must never fight hate with hate and to remember the values of peace openness and justice that represent the best of America Wow Nancy Pelosi the Botox receded long enough for her to issue that statement that's a very good statement by Nancy Pelosi good for you representative Pelosi really that is that is good stuff I hope that this is the beginning of the Democratic establishment beginning to disassociate from antiva because what we're seeing instead in Berkeley is some politicians who are willing to make way for an anti feh there they're throwing another roadblock up believe it or not with regards to my event September 14th in Berkeley I want to make a quick distinction between my events and the free speech week that comes I believe a week and a half later in Berkeley that's one featuring and closer and maybe Steve Benin and maybe Milo I believe Milo is definitely gonna speak there he's one of the organizers that's happening after my event my event is September 14th both of them have been approved by Berkley but just the news coverage have been conflating the two they're not the same events and not all the people hold the same views obviously but regardless everybody there has the rights of free speech just as I have a right to free speech so what is Berkley doing now so Berkeley still has not released tickets okay it is now August 30th the event is on September 14th and about you but virtually all concerts release tickets months in advance okay the idea that you're going to release tickets I guess maybe two weeks in it they're now talking about next week releasing tickets giving people like a week and a half to sign up we already have nearly 2,000 people who have signed up through yeah org for the event itself and we're going to try and translate those over to tickets at Berkeley what is Berkeley doing apparently they're now trying to require that the F and the College Republicans tell everybody that if you want to pick up your ticket you have to come the day before before or 5:00 p.m. to pick it up if they won't mail them out that they won't print them out then instead you have to physically come there the day before before 5:00 p.m. does that sound like they're trying to throw up a roadblock to filling out the the auditorium it certainly does to me I've never heard of a public event where we have to arrive the day before in person to pick up your tickets have you ever heard of something like this Malthus I've never heard of something like this I mean if every ticketing system in America and around the world allows you to print out your ticket at home allows you to pick up your ticket at the box office the day of yeah this is total madness and it's obvious that they're trying to throw up obstacles at this point please if you have a chance go over to youch org and register for the event and they have the information for Berkeley's administration they should be letting know by you that this is unacceptable okay all we want to do go and have an event talking about free speech and aunt Eva and the alt-right and black lives matter and social justice warriors and hit on all these hot-button issues in a in a in a I think well-thought-out way that's all we want to do and exercising those free speech rights is made difficult even by the people who pledge to uphold them over at Berkeley which is really quite astounding so I would hope that Berkeley does its job and releases the tickets ASAP and forthwith because I know that there are literally thousands of people who want to show up okay time for things I like and then we'll do some things I hate and then we'll do a little bit of Bible talk so things I like we've been doing a little bit of philosophy this week another book on philosophy that was held near and zere by a lot of the early a lot of the early conservatives in the country was Edmund Burke's reflections on the revolution in France one of the great differences between some of the founders was how they felt about the French Revolution some people like John Adams saw the French Revolution as dangerous which it was some people like Thomas Jefferson initially loved the French Revolution and thought that this was the overthrow of the old order and something new would be built in its place Burke's reflections on the revolution in France Brooke was a supporter of the American Revolution and and Burke was a believer in representative democracy not to wreck democracy his book reflections on the revolution of France basically predicts what is going to happen in the Revolution and why it's going to fall apart right he was because it did fall apart it turns out when the community overthrows the individual that revolutions fall apart the difference between the American Revolution and the French Revolution is that the American Revolution was based on the idea that human beings are endowed by their creator creators with certain inalienable rights and that government is enshrined in order and empowered in order to protect those individual rights the French Revolution was based on the idea that all rights spring from governments and the community and therefore the community has the ability to overrule individual rights in any situation where it sees fit to do so pretty different revolution Brooke points that out and he points out the value of respecting tradition particularly if you don't know what it is there's a I think it's Robert Frost who says this but I but I'm not sure who says that the noce I'm sorry it's Chesterton who makes the argument out of offenses he says that you know the difference seen a conservative and a leftist is that a conservative sees offense in the middle of a field and says to himself don't know why that fence is there maybe I should find out why that fence is there before removing it I left this seize a fence in the middle of the field and says there's no reason for this fence to be here I'm removing it I think that's a pretty good summation of the the main thrust of Edmund Burke's reflections on the revolution in France okay other things that I like so there's been a lot of talk about Colin Kaepernick a crappy quarterback for the 49ers kneeling for the national anthem and now they're a bunch of people on the horrifyingly Bad Cleveland Browns who kneel for the national anthem good for a Cowboys QB dak Prescott who is asked specifically about kneeling for the national anthem here's what he had to say as the thought crossed your mind about participating do you feel they need to do so no not at all well why not why do you feel the need to not participate in that I mean it's it's bigger than then I think some of us think I mean it's just important for me to go out there and over my heart represent our country I just be thankful and not take anything I've been given and and then there's my freedom offer granite good for him good for him I don't understand why this is so tough for people to say if you have problems with the system fight the system but if you are going to you know if you're going to fight the national anthem all the unifying features of the country themselves then you're undermining those unifying feature is good for dak Prescott I'm now rooting for dak Prescott seems like a good guy this does the stuff does make difference folks if that seems shallow that I don't root for Colin Kaepernick because I think that his views on America are negative and destructive but I do root for dak Prescott because I think that his views on politics are good maybe your solution ought to be removing politics from sports altogether maybe that ought to be your solution but as so long as politics is gonna be infused into sports then I'm gonna root for guys like dak Prescott who seems like a much better human being than Colin Kaepernick at least so far as his views on the country are concerned okay time for some things that I hate so Kathy Griffin has been out of the news for a few months ever since she did a photo shoot at which he held up the mock mock-up of a bloody head bloody decapitated head of President Trump she hasn't been in the news so she's decided it's time to get back in the news this time by reneging on her apology which just demonstrates why fake apologies are stupid in the first place here she is are you no longer sorry for it correct I'm no longer sorry the whole outrage was BS the whole thing got so blown out of proportion and I lost everybody like I had Chelsea Clinton tweeting against me I had friends Debra Messing from willing Grace tweeting against me I mean I lost everybody and so I have been through the mill and I also you know I didn't just lose like one night on CNN my entire tour was canceled within 24 hours because every single theater got all these death threats I mean these Trump fans they're hardcore they have like robo calls and they're a minority but we know how to act like they're a majority Debra Messing and Chelsea Clinton on Trump fans like if even Democrats said it was out of line I get that comedy is about pushing the boundaries and being politically incorrect and that's fine but do you not agree that that picture holding up a severed head I know it's a mask covered in tomato sauce but did you not accept that was a little bit over the line no you're full of crap stop this you know this stop acting like my little picture is more important than talking about the actual atrocities that the president of the United States is committing okay what atrocities involve the President of the United States holding up the bloodied severed head of his political enemies I'm missing that part it is amazing look she just wants attention she wasn't able to get it with her original shtick in a way that she liked so now she's walking it back and she's she's will here's the thing she knows that a lot of the people on the left are gonna quietly accept her back that if she does this she feels stronger right it makes her stronger than all these people are going to now walk back from their original anger at Kathy Griffin they're gonna say well she was misguided she apologized in the first place and people weren't willing to accept for apology so screw it she's on our side you know that's the the direction in which they're going to move quickly here that's the part that I hate Kathy Griffin I think is completely irrelevant but it does demonstrate that when people on the left to decide that it is imperative to to make headlines by ripping Trump and then apologize for it later the apology is completely false Don Lemon on CNN whose show I enjoy doing but Don Lemon did did a segment last night another thing I hate in which he suggested that President Trump doesn't like his black critics particularly there's a racism in the way that Trump treats his critics there are lots of people on this network and others who don't look like me who are harder on this president and who say disparaging things about this president but he doesn't get as upset with them as he does with me why is that okay it's a ridiculous question the idea that Trump is only upside down lemon because Don Lemon is black is just ridiculous Trump is one of most petty human beings on the planet okay the idea that he's not upset with white people who are mad at him or women who are mad at him I mean Don Lemon hasn't gotten half of what megyn kelly got just during the election cycle and if you're gonna talk about people who have been targeted because they didn't like Trump okay there are a number of people who have been very critical of Trump I mean he's going after sitting senators in his own party he's going after Jeff Flake who's a senator of his own party the hell is Don Lemon talking about but again everything for the left has to be infused with this extra degree of voracious nastiness and when you do that all you're doing is playing right into Trump hands beat Trump's hands because everybody can see that this is nonsense okay final thing that I hate a lot of people are all over the cni I just said something about a CNN host that was negative now I'm gonna say something about a CNN reporter that is actually not so a lot of people are all over the CNN reporter she's on the ground during hurricane Harvey and she's being asked about and she asks a hurricane victim about the situation on the ground and the hurricane victim really goes after her on camera a lot of the right was was overjoyed with this let me introduce you to Danielle here Daniel you just arrived share with us how you were rescued some guys they caught our phone and asked us where we work we was waiting for the police for like thirty-six hours and they never came and we was waiting at the home we did the white flags and everything and nobody came but then somebody had called the phone after we decided to leave the house we had walked it against they shit with the kids and then they had called it came he picked us up but we had been there like five days with no food no lights and nobody came like nobody came now you're with your children we've heard of stories of mothers trying to save their children from the rushing waters can you tell us how that was four feet of water to go get them food on the first day yeah that's a lot of fish I'll sit here y'all trying to interview people during their worst times like that not the smartest thing to do like people are really breaking down and y'all sitting here with cameras and microphones don't ask cuz with them is wrong with it you really trying to understand with the microphone still in my face when me shivering cold with my kids wet are you still putting a microphone in my face everybody's all over the reporter oh look at this woman this woman's really speaking truth to power okay I have a couple problems with this one the woman clearly agreed to be on camera before this happened and the reporters don't just run up to people and thrust a microphone in their face they asked them for their permission before they interview them okay I've done it myself his notion that that the reporter did something wrong here is absurd I understand why this woman would be emotional and upset I understand even why she'd be upset with the media who may feel like they're Hawks here but let's be real about one thing the fact is that if the media were not covering hurricane Harvey the amount of charity flowing into funds to help people with hurricane Harvey would be much lower it is media coverage that drives people's empathy okay you want to talk about empathy as cash this is what it is can people empathize with that mother because they saw her on TV and then they want to send cash and that's good in the realm of private charity I don't think empathy such a great thing when it comes to public policy but in the realm of private charity it actually is good so for all people who are all over CNN for this that's not fair I think that's unfair to this reporter I think it's unfair to CNN I think it's unfair to CNN's coverage okay a little bit of Bible talk before we part ways so every Wednesday we do a little bit of Bible talk here on the bench Shapiro show and we talk specifically about the the sections from the prophets this year because last year we went through the entirety of the Old Testament first five books of Moses so now we are doing the some of the prophets so this is from this week's haftorah which is the section of the profits corresponding to the the section of the Bible that we read every week this is from the Book of Isaiah and this is from Isaiah 54 7:8 says for a small movement have I forsaken you and with great mercy will I gather you with a little wrath did I hide my countenance for a moment from you and with everlasting kindness will I have compassion on you says your Redeemer the Lord and says for this is to me as the waters of Noah as I swore that the waters of Noah shall never again pass over the earth so have I sworn neither to be wroth with you nor to rebuke you okay so I thought that this was a good biblical reading for a time when so many people have been evacuated from their homes and what I mean frankly looks like biblical scale flooding I mean this is just incredible stuff 51 inches in in Texas the US record I think this speaks to the what is God doing here you can never talk about why God allows tragedy to happen because we just don't know okay there are certain limits to human understanding but what God is assuring us here through Isaiah is the idea that the status quo for nature the status quo for a world without God is a world of chaos in a world of in a world of disaster and a world of badness I think there's this bizarre notion in a lot of philosophers like Rousseau that the state of nature is grand and glorious and everybody is getting along and it's the noble savage and whether is great and it's on the outside that's really not how things work nature is has spent its entire its entire lifespan Nature has spent its time trying to kill human beings and nature is is a is it for us without reckoning so the idea that without God's protection nature would overtake us it's true that's what it means when it doesn't say God is actively punishing you with storms here what it says is that God has withdrawn his face and I'm not speaking to this particular storm because I can't get inside God's head I am saying is that with all the storms physical material spiritual that we undergo in this life sometimes that is God just shading his countenance and that's why it's important for us to recognize and seek him out the closer we draw to God doesn't mean that we're gonna be protected from disaster I'm not a preacher of prosperity gospel I don't believe that belief in God and faith in God is gonna protect you from bad things that happen but it is going to allow you to have more faith that God's countenance is hidden and will reveal itself again and that's what this is talking about now that God is never gonna hide his countenance not that there aren't gonna be times when you don't understand what God is doing because I don't understand what God is doing in Texas right now and neither does anybody else but understand that God's face will emerge once again and that God is is is there even when he's hiding himself even when we don't know what he's doing he's still there and that eventually God's light will shine again and I think it will try to get on the people of Texas and I think they're showing tremendous fortitude and tremendous strength in the face of a brutal period all of our thoughts and prayers and yes our charity goes out to the people in Texas right now okay we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
