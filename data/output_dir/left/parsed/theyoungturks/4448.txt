IF YOU HAVE BEEN CONFUSED
WHILE TRYING TO FOLLOW THE LEGAL
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COURT CASES
IN DIFFERENT STATES AROUND THE
COUNTRY HAVING TO DO WITH DONALD
TRUMP'S MUSLIM TRAVEL BAN, I
CAN'T BLAME YOU.
IT HAS BEEN
CONFUSING.
BUT YOU SHOULD BEAR
IN MIND WHILE LOOKING AT THESE
CONSTANT BACK-AND-FORTH THAT --
>>THERE ARE THESE VARIOUS COURT
CHALLENGES, AND WE WILL KNOW
DEFINITIVELY ON OCTOBER 10 WHEN
THE SUPREME COURT GIVES THE
TRAVEL BAN A FULL REVIEW.
THERE
HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK
SECTIONS OF IT, DEFINE CERTAIN
TERMS IN REGARDS TO IT, BUT
THESE ARE ALL TEMPORARY MEASURES
UNTIL THE SUPREME COURT DOES
THAT REVIEW IN OCTOBER.
THAT
BEING SAID, WE DO HAVE ANOTHER
DEVELOPMENT TO ADD ON TO WHAT
YOU PREVIOUSLY LEARNED, THIS HAS
TO DO WITH DONALD TRUMP'S
ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK PEOPLE USING
HAVING GRANDPARENTS AND OTHER
CLOSE FAMILY MEMBERS AS A
RATIONALE TO BE ALLOWED TO ENTER
THE COUNTRY.
HE DIDN'T WANT THAT
TO BE THE CASE, AND THE SUPREME
COURT DOESN'T AGREE WITH HIM.
ALTHOUGH HE DID GET SOMETHING
OUT OF WHAT WAS REVEALED TODAY
--
>>THAT IS SORT OF THE GOOD
NEWS FOR THOSE PEOPLE.
UNFORTUNATELY --
>>A LITTLE GIVE, A LITTLE TAKE
ON THE BAN.
THE BAN IS NOT
HALTED, IT IS A LITTLE BIT LESS
STRICT, AT LEAST TEMPORARILY.
>>I'M JUST GLAD THAT TRUMP IS
USING THIS INCREDIBLY CRITICAL
TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON, BECAUSE HE JUST
NEEDED SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON.
HE
HASN'T QUITE BEEN IN OFFICE FOR
-- OH, WAIT A MINUTE, HE HAD A
LOT OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT WHAT
THE HELL HAS BEEN GOING ON.
BUT
HE IS BUSY HOLDING MEETINGS WITH
WORLD LEADERS THAT TRUMP
PROPERTIES SO HE CAN LINE HIS
POCKETS WITH THE POSITION HE
HAS, BUT NO ONE CARES ABOUT THAT
CONFLICT OF INTEREST -- HE'S
BUSY GOLFING, GOING TO FLORIDA.
THOSE ARE ALL REALLY IMPORTANT
THINGS, SO HE HASN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON.
SO I'M GLAD THAT WE
ARE NOW WASTING OUR PRECIOUS
RESOURCES ON TRYING TO
ADJUDICATE HOW THIS TRAVEL BAN
CAN LEGALLY MOVE FORWARD.
IT'S
FRUSTRATING, I THINK HIS FEAR
MONGERING AND THE FEAR MONGERING
FROM THE RIGHT HAS UNFORTUNATELY
WORKED TO THE POINT WHERE PEOPLE
NEEDLESSLY SUPPORT THIS
RIDICULOUS TRAVEL BAN, BUT
WHATEVER.
IF YOU WOULD RATHER
SEE TAXPAYER MONEY GO TOWARD
THIS EFFORT THAN TAKING CARE OF
OUR ACTUAL CITIZENS, THAT'S
FINE.
AND THAT'S THE THING, THEY
THINK THIS WILL TAKE CARE OF US.
THEY ARE NOT LOOKING INTO
RIGHT-WING TERRORISM IN THE
COUNTRY, THEY ARE NOT LOOKING AT
ACTUAL ISSUES THAT PUT OUR
SAFETY IN JEOPARDY, THEY ARE
JUST LOOKING AT THESE
NONEXISTENT THREATS FROM
REFUGEES, PEOPLE WHO LITERALLY
WANT TO ESCAPE DEATH AND
PERSECUTION IN THEIR OWN
COUNTRIES.
>>I WILL SAY THAT THROUGHOUT THE
YEAR THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF
BIG MOVEMENTS AND MARCHES AND
RALLIES ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT
ISSUES.
YOU'VE HAD DONALD
TRUMP'S TAXES, CLIMATE SCIENCE,
THE WOMEN'S MARCH -- BUT THERE
WAS ALSO MULTIPLE DAYS OF
RALLYING AT AIRPORTS, MANY
MEMBERS OF TYT WENT, I WAS LUCKY
ENOUGH TO GO TWICE TO THE L.A.
BRANCH OF IT, TO PROTECT
PEOPLE'S ACCESS TO THE COUNTRY,
TO NOT STIGMATIZE AND BLOCK
THESE PEOPLE FROM THESE
COUNTRIES FROM COMING IN.
THERE
WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE
COUNTRY ORGANIZING FOR THAT.
AND
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE
EXPECTED THAT THAT WOULD'VE
DRAWN AS MUCH SUPPORT, BECAUSE
OF WHAT WE FEAR ABOUT PEOPLE'S
XENOPHOBIA THAT THEY LEARNED
FROM THE RIGHT.
IT'S ONE THING
TO ORGANIZE FOR CLIMATE SCIENCE,
IT'S ANOTHER TO ORGANIZE FOR
WOMEN, BUT THIS IS ALMOST P
REALLY, ASIDE FROM OBVIOUSLY
SOME AMERICAN MUSLIMS WHO ARE
ORGANIZING, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
DOING IT FOR PEOPLE THEY DON'T
KNOW BUT BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE
IT'S RIGHT.
I FOUND THAT TO BE
INSPIRATIONAL EARLIER THIS YEAR.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN
ON OCTOBER 10, BUT WHEN THE
SUPREME COURT CONSIDERS THIS AND
RELEASES A RULING, WE DON'T KNOW
IF THE ENTIRE THING WILL BE
UPHELD OR KNOCKED DOWN OR SOME
PART OF IT WILL GO INTO EFFECT
AND OTHERS WON'T. WE ARE JUST
TRYING TO READ FROM THEIR
INTERIM OPINIONS WHAT THEY MIGHT
THINK.
WE DO KNOW THAT --
>>SO YOUR GRANDMA IS TOO BIG OF
A THREAT, ACCORDING TO AT LEAST
THOSE THREE JUSTICES.
AND THE
REST, WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY
WILL COME OUT ON IT.
WHILE THERE
HAS BEEN AT THE FEDERAL COURT
LEVEL, THE APPEALS COURT LEVEL,
THERE HAVE BEEN GOOD
DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE
INAUGURATION, THERE HAS ALSO
BEEN REASON TO FEAR THAT SOME OF
IT MIGHT BECOME LAW.
