it's perhaps another sign Zimbabwe's economy may take a long time to recover some people have been lining up since Saturday to fill up their cars the central bank governor says fuel shortages are because of the introduction of a two percent tax on bank transactions that means products now cost more and suppliers are buying less it's led to shortages and many disappointed customers it's absolutely very very disappointing because everything is at a standstill we can't do any business we can't do anything because you have to spend all day waiting for fuel the worsening economic crisis is compounded by a critical shortage of cash the last time lines were this long was back in 2008 some people would sleep in their cars for days hoping to get fuel government officials are telling the bobbins not to panic but some people say they are worried in some places fuel has started arriving but it's still not enough others are stocking up on groceries these days bread is in short supply and usually doesn't last long on the shelves in some stores customers are limited to two items per person to prevent hoarding and panic buying and it causes some people to say that now's the time to stock up because next month we would build afford a different there's a even higher in price and so it's behavior patterns have changed when people are uncertain over the future and those uncertainties have come so far in these very big price increases prices are tripled in just a few days it's the question of increase in capacities question of manufacturers I'm featuring more to fill up those shelves because it's just a surge in demand it's a it's the same speculation that some causing some panic buying but again these things are under control there will be no shortages but increasing production needs foreign currency US dollars that banks say they don't have enough of some importance buy dollars on the black market at a premium some Zimbabweans worried there could be more frustration and hardship before things get better hari Murtaza al-jazeera hari
