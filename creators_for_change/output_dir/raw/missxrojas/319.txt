1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
hey everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so before you watch this</font>

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">video you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might want to watch Charlie's</font>

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,740
video and then Michaels video first

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,109
because this is sort of a continuation

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,970
of that discussion in the video he made

6
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,559
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> last week chili talking</font>

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,509
about being kind of creatively stuck but

8
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,630
also slightly plagued by this anxiety of

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,050
what people were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying about him</font>

10
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,539
and you know whether sort of in a way

11
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,630
whether he mattered I felt was like the

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:27,000
crux of that video whether you make an

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,010
impact on people in a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know so</font>

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,029
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this weird thing going on</font>

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,349
where you still taneously feel the

16
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,120
pressure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audience but then you</font>

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,210
also feel the pressure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being one of</font>

18
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,370
you know six seven billion people in the

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,110
world Charlie suggested that this might

20
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,850
just be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human thing that might just be</font>

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way everyone feels and Michael</font>

22
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,239
picked up on that and stress that and

23
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,770
said that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you know</font>

24
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,300
we all do you feel and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

25
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">true to an extent but I think there's</font>

26
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,690
something about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of always</font>

27
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,719
crisis that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular to our format</font>

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,610
as youtubers it's something that I spoke

29
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">about at a breakfast a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks</font>

30
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,989
ago but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've heard to formalize</font>

31
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:03,300
our schedules this whole past couple of

32
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,010
years I would say has been a project to

33
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,570
do that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me it's taken the form of</font>

34
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,100
eventually deciding to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> monday</font>

35
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,930
wednesday friday videos for other people

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,369
it's trying to put out one or two videos

37
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,470
a month and even signing contracts with

38
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,509
networks which put that expectation into

39
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,100
their contracts because that way it's

40
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,869
even more formalized and you have the

41
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:20,220
pressure of something being written down

42
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,930
another example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is something</font>

43
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> charlie is a big fan of</font>

44
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,390
which is the don't break the chain

45
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,280
format which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

46
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,990
something every single day and you cross

47
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,880
it off an invisible calendar in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

48
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an unbroken chain of days in which</font>

49
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,350
you did something particular outlined by

50
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,970
the little calendar all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

51
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,040
can work of course they can work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>

52
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,570
me I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you know starting to</font>

53
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,310
work this whole three video a week thing

54
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,740
but it is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a big shift</font>

55
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,540
and we can't underestimate how big the

56
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,060
shift that is from having school be

57
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,729
something you do 24-7 with video on the

58
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,530
side or the initial period when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

59
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,240
more time to create and you suddenly

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,829
have all this energy that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't</font>

61
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,829
have before to now when it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming a</font>

62
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,350
bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a difficult fight to make</font>

63
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,180
something you like I remember Maureen

64
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,950
Johnson talking a few years ago about

65
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">daring to suck and that is so true as</font>

66
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:09,568
true with writing as it is with<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

67
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,060
videos you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to create all this crap</font>

68
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,450
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you create</font>

69
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,950
things that you actually like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

70
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:16,300
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that things that you aren't happy</font>

71
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,099
with aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that other people</font>

72
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:20,590
won't love but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to accept this</font>

73
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,560
element of being dissatisfied with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

74
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,260
work and that's crap thing to face up to

75
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,120
because you don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

76
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,220
dissatisfied with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> especially</font>

77
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,709
if like me you're a perfectionist and it

78
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,470
just scares you to hell being<font color="#E5E5E5"> unhappy</font>

79
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,300
with what you're creating let alone

80
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,310
having to share that so they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

81
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,620
these pressures built into that but the

82
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,410
former of<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube their response format</font>

83
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,010
how heavy comments and likes and shares

84
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,410
and just general views how heavy that

85
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,780
influences your perception of how well

86
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,090
you've done that makes it a kind of

87
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,829
different beast altogether and what's

88
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">more it's also immediate whereas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

89
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,209
book or a film you'll be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

90
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:03,040
for such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time and then you'll get</font>

91
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
that response which is terrifying in a

92
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,099
different way this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you've</font>

93
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:08,230
created within the range of a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

94
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,599
hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks and then you get</font>

95
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,010
the response<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that and it's just</font>

96
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,079
this constant cycle of response so if it

97
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:16,060
gets true that as humans we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> scared</font>

98
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,799
and we are anxious and that can be a

99
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,510
comfort in a way we're making this

100
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,400
transition from do something as a hobby

101
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,400
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fun creative side project to it</font>

102
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,739
being a significant part of our creative

103
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,530
output in our lifetime on this planet of

104
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,720
course that's terrifying and<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

105
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,609
the fact that you're being judged

106
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,519
immediately on that is terrifying not to

107
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,829
mention any sort of expectation you

108
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,930
place on that yourself furthermore as

109
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,459
the website grows as the audience

110
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:44,980
changes as different big companies

111
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,530
become involved as you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

112
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,930
paying rent as you have to start do all

113
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,609
these other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> at once there are all</font>

114
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,040
sorts of day-to-day pressures that come

115
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,319
into that along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and</font>

116
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,470
web site specific ones so it's kind of

117
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,630
no wonder and to be honest I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

118
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,310
amazing that you have gone this long

119
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Charlie without getting to that point</font>

120
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,500
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel like this there's the</font>

121
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,389
aspect of it that's part and parcel of

122
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,359
what we choose to spend our time doing

123
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and I don't know whether that's</font>

124
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,829
just a factor of creative discipline

125
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,839
being something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've never really</font>

126
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,150
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font>

127
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,070
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whether this is just a temporary</font>

128
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,170
little blip that will last I don't know

129
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,840
18 months or so and then everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

130
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,460
go back to normal and we'll be able to

131
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,170
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> in new and interesting ways</font>

132
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:35,320
whether that's on youtube or off youtube

133
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,520
and writing or whatever it is so it's

134
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,230
difficult it's a difficult time but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

135
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,910
just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ramble to</font>

136
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is</font>

137
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,420
just a human thing I do think it's a

138
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,700
YouTube thing all right bye guys I will

139
00:04:48,700 --> 00:00:00,000
see you on Wednesday
