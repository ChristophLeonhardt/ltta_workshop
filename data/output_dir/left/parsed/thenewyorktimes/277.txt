“It’s about making
America great again.
Are you with us?”
Republicans and
conservative groups
have poured more than
$10 million into a special election
to fill a congressional
seat in Pennsylvania,
outspending Democrats 10 to 1.
But that’s not all.
In order to stump
for the G.O.P. candidate,
Rick Saccone, President Trump
has visited the district twice.
Vice President Mike Pence
has been there,
as has Ivanka Trump,
the president’s daughter,
and Kellyanne Conway,
the White House counselor.
All this for a seat that will
open up again in eight months
with the November midterms.
Most polls point
to a close race,
and both Republicans
and Democrats say
there’s far more at stake
than a single seat.
Trump won the district
by 20 points in 2016.
“Donald Trump has won the
state of Pennsylvania.”
Saccone is an Air Force veteran
who shares a vision of the country
with the president.
“The world is in turmoil
and our country is in turmoil.”
“Our nation’s infrastructure
is crumbling.”
“North Korea is a dangerous
threat to America.”
The president is a fan, too.
“Rick Saccone said he was
‘Trump before Trump.’
Rick is a great guy.”
Saccone’s opponent is
Conor Lamb, a former Marine
and federal prosecutor.
“People in my party don’t
support natural gas drilling.
I do.”
A moderate Democrat,
he supports fracking,
believes life begins at conception
and is opposed to adding
new gun control measures.
“Medicare for all or single payer —
I don’t support that.”
And he has pointedly
distanced himself
from the House Democratic leadership.
“I didn’t support Nancy Pelosi
for any leadership position.”
But while a victory for Lamb
could offer some insight
into how Democrats can win
back working-class voters,
and build momentum
for the midterms,
it would also be
a blow to Nancy Pelosi.
For the G.O.P., the special election
is a proving ground for the
president’s political gamble
on steel tariffs,
and a chance to test
whether rank-and-file
union members who
voted for Trump in 2016
will also cast their ballot for
other Republican candidates.
