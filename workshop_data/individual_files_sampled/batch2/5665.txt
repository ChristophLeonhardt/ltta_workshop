I felt this effort to make us all and maybe this wasn't their intention but it's the way I felt to me to make us all a Miko Nostra we're all part of the messaging we're all part of the effort the boss is at the head of the table we're gonna figure out together how to do this how strange is it for you to sit here and compare the president to a mob boss very strange and I don't do it lightly that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration James Comey said it robert muller just might be acting on it the special counsel seemingly rounding up the president's good fellows with his sights quite possibly set on Trump The Guardian says the news over the past 24 hours is a sobering reminder of how closely the President of the United States resembles a crime boss struggling to keep his head above water as his henchmen are picked off by law enforcement one by one the panel still here and it glides still with us Eddie let me start with you I think people people project onto Comey all of their angst about all of the events of the last 24 months but I think that seemed a little hyperbolic or dramatic in the moment but if you look at the way these prosecutions are going down really not so far off not at all and and those persons who know Donald Trump from New York might even make it more concrete there's always been this kind of underlying suspicion given his work in Atlantic City that he has had these kind of shall we say shady connections and it seems given that the all-star team that baller has put together that they've approached Donald Trump in this way so there's concrete evidence the analogy Orient's us perfectly but I think there's something real about how Donald Trump is being treated and how Donald Trump operates and so it's not far-fetched at all there's a lot of attempts to draw parallels the Muller probe is like the Enron probe the Muller Probus like the the mother probe is is like the the Gotti prosecution well I mean a lot of people made that comparison it's easy to compare Trump to a mob boss when he sort of acts that way in plain sight I mean just take the tweet about Manta fort this morning what the president is basically saying is paulie's a good boy Paulie didn't flip that's what he's saying and and he's he's you know I mean his view of the law is incredibly selective we talked about him going on the campaign trail what does he say on the campaign trail what does he want to emphasize immigration what does he say what do you say at the White House this week with ice officers were a nation of immigrants but above all we are a nation of laws well which laws because the laws that are seeing his associates prosecuted now the president tells us in real time those laws don't matter because for years I talked to people close to the president all day yesterday this morning and they say he has this view of what man afford did and what Cohen did as sort of what everybody does and he feels that he and his associates are being targeted unfairly because now he's president and and that may be true none of this may be happening if he hadn't won the election but this is where we are and in his mind this is something that is these are things maybe they're illegal but people just do it but what they marry that he's being targeted that he thought about this who do you want to make Attorney General of the United States what did he say and I think we have you afforded this there was someone for me What did he say he said that we said it's publicly right he's so disappointed in sessions was he thought sessions as Attorney General with loyal to him and would protect him and would use justice so the analogy it would be a mob boss who thinks he has the cops in his pocket and suddenly the police chief goes rogue and starts to actually get serious about investigating are we actually I mean I think what everything 49 minutes in I know you're dying to get it let me just let me throw out one last question for all of you where are we right now in terms of the president's greatest threat I mean is it all of his conduct in office everything we've been talking about dangling the pardons the tweets is it obstruction addresses it is is that what he's potentially in the most trouble for who knows they're looking at a lot of things this is why I would just say like I don't mean the objective in this conversation is we're talking about it like the mob thing is metaphorical it's not metaphorical it's real Michael Cohen is like a childhood friend of Felix aiders Felix Sater was in bed with the Russians with the right with Felix tato was in bed for his life with the Russian mafia he's he's an FBI informant against the run against Russian organized crime Donald Trump has been dealing with people in organized crime American organized crime and Russian organized crime for his entire career this is not and this why the Michael Cohen thing is so threatening because again to go back to the point that that Schmidt made earlier today the politics of this again they have spent all this time demonizing the the deep state and for now it's Brennan but first it was Co me and then it was Muller all of those people Trump needs a bogeyman he goes after them but he goes after these people that he can point to and they're his enemies there's no one to point to in the Michael Cohen prosecution because we can't name any of the prosecutors in the SDN why most people this table probably can't certainly very no one in America can there's only one face the michael cohen case and it's michael cohen and mike we almost donald trump's lawyer for 12 years and so what are you gonna do you're gonna try to demonize the guy they've tried Mike Collins a long time liar really he was your lawyer surprise don't hire Michael Cohen well who hired him for over right hearing Comey there reminded me and sort of the whole mob theme of the incredible miscalculation that Trump made early on which was to ask homie for loyalty Trump never appreciated the subtleties of Washington where that would be such a problem he came in as a New York businessman and immediately turns to Jim Comey of all people and says how can you be loyal hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
