tires you guys the last game here you
did the same thing I need to share
something from my heart here and I just
asked you to bear with me and when you
make a mistake you have to own up to it
that's the Montana way last night I made
a mistake and I took an action that I
can't take back and I'm not proud of
what happened I should not have
responded in the way that I did and for
that I'm sorry
I should not have treated that reporter
that way and for that I'm sorry
mr. Ben Jacobs the Fox News senior and
I'm sorry
each one of you that we had to go
through this that's not the person that
I am and it's not the way I'll lead in
this state
rest assured our work is just beginning
but it does begin with me taking
responsibility for my own actions
