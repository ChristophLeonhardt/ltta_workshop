1
00:00:06,755 --> 00:00:09,457
>> Tucker: NOW THE ISSUE OF

2
00:00:09,457 --> 00:00:10,792
HORSE MEAT.

3
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,828
EATING HORSES HAS BEEN TABOO FOR

4
00:00:13,828 --> 00:00:16,197
ALMOST ALL OF AMERICAN HISTORY

5
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:18,433
AND FOR GOOD REASON.

6
00:00:18,433 --> 00:00:20,435
BUT RECENTLY CONGRESS HAS

7
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,371
THOUGHT TO CHANGE.

8
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:25,874
HERE IS WHAT DAVE HAD TO SAY

9
00:00:25,874 --> 00:00:26,308
ABOUT IT?

10
00:00:26,308 --> 00:00:28,643
>> THANK YOU, TUCKER FOR HAVING

11
00:00:28,643 --> 00:00:30,245
ME ON.

12
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,446
>> Tucker: THIS AS YOU WELL

13
00:00:31,446 --> 00:00:33,682
KNOW, STRIKES PEOPLE IN THE

14
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:35,317
CITIES AS HORRIFYING.

15
00:00:35,317 --> 00:00:37,452
WHY IS IT A GOOD IDEA?

16
00:00:37,452 --> 00:00:43,525
>> IT IS MAINLY A WELFARE ISSUE.

17
00:00:43,525 --> 00:00:46,294
THE HORSE WORLD IS GONE DOWNHILL

18
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:48,596
EVERY SINCE WHEN YOU HAVE

19
00:00:48,596 --> 00:00:49,898
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE

20
00:00:49,898 --> 00:00:52,233
VALUE WHICH IS WHAT THE UNWANTED

21
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:54,235
HORSE IS, THEY ARE SHIPPED TO

22
00:00:54,235 --> 00:00:56,538
CANADA AND MEXICO AND THEY ARE

23
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:58,206
NOT WORTH ANYTHING.

24
00:00:58,206 --> 00:01:00,608
>> Tucker: WE HAVE A LOT OF

25
00:01:00,608 --> 00:01:03,945
PROBLEMS WITH DOMESTICATED

26
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:07,782
ANIMALS; CATS AND DOGS AND WE

27
00:01:07,782 --> 00:01:08,650
DON'T EAT THEM.

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,618
IT CROSSES A LINE.

29
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:12,887
WHY ARE SO HORSES DIFFERENT?

30
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:15,156
>> HORSES IS CONSIDERED

31
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:17,492
LIVESTOCK IN EVERY STATE IN THE

32
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,794
UNION AND THEY ARE ON AVERAGE

33
00:01:19,794 --> 00:01:22,430
A THOUSAND POUND ANIMAL.

34
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,668
YOU START ETHANIZING THE ONE

35
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,837
50,000 HORSES A YEAR, YOU ARE

36
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:31,473
TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF POUNDS

37
00:01:31,473 --> 00:01:32,841
OF TOXIC WASTE.

38
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,043
>> Tucker: IT IS A QUESTION OF

39
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:37,445
DISPOSING AND WHO WOULD EAT IT?

40
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:41,416
>> WELL, WE HAVE QUITE A MARKET

41
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:41,816
ACTUALLY.

42
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:45,320
IN 2011, WHEN THE RIDER'S CAME

43
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,688
OFF OF THE APPROPRIATION SAYS

44
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:47,022
BILL.

45
00:01:47,022 --> 00:01:49,891
I WAS ADVOCATING FOR IT.

46
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:56,097
AND I WAS CONTACTED BY THE

47
00:01:56,097 --> 00:01:57,599
TONGUN COMMUNITY AND A MEAT

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,567
BUYER IN THE SOUTH IN FLORIDA

49
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:03,004
WHO HAD 2.3 MILLION HISPANICS

50
00:02:03,004 --> 00:02:05,106
WHO WOULD EAT IT EVERY DAY IF

51
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,875
THEY COULD GET IT.

52
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:09,777
MANY ETHNIC GROUPS.

53
00:02:09,777 --> 00:02:11,212
>> Tucker: AMERICA IS DISTINCT

54
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:13,615
IN THAT WE DON'T EAT IT AND THE

55
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,016
FRENCH DO.

56
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:18,620
AND IT HAS BEEN A MORE THAN

57
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,657
CENTURY POINT OF PRIDE AND

58
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:24,859
BRAGGING OF LIKE YOU EAT HORSES

59
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:25,860
AND WE DON'T.

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,496
DOESN'T THIS PUT US AT THE LEVEL

61
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:29,631
OF THE FRENCH?

62
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:35,470
>> THAT IS A TOTAL MISNOMER.

63
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:42,077
OVER 50 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S

64
00:02:42,077 --> 00:02:47,115
COUNTRIES AND WE'LL FIND HORSE

65
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:49,017
MEAT INDUSTRY THAN ANY OTHER

66
00:02:49,017 --> 00:02:50,185
TYPE OF MEAT.

67
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,656
AND CHINESE AND JAPANESE AND ALL

68
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:58,059
OF THE AFRICA, IF THEY CAN GET

69
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,561
AHOLD OF HORSE MEAT THEY WILL

70
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,428
EAT IT.

71
00:03:00,428 --> 00:03:04,299
IF YOU ATE TACOS ON THE BEACH IN

72
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,635
KABO, YOU HAVE EATEN HORSE MEAT.

73
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,971
1985 HORSE MEAT WAS AVAILABLE ON

74
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:12,874
THE MENU AND THE HARVARD FACULTY

75
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:13,308
CLUB.

76
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:17,312
AND THE ONLY REASON THEY DIDN'T

77
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:18,680
KEECH IT.

78
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,849
THE NEW CHEF DIDN'T WANT TO COOK

79
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,484
ANYTHING THAT WAS FROZEN AND

80
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:24,119
THAT WAS IN 1985.

81
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,855
WE HAVE A HUGE HISTORY OF HORSE

82
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:28,389
MEAT CONSUMPTION IN THE UNITED

83
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:28,756
STATES.

84
00:03:28,756 --> 00:03:30,325
AND THE HUMANE SOCIETY IN THE

85
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,593
UNITED STATES WILL TRY TO TELL

86
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,328
YOU THAT THAT IS NOT SO.

87
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:35,563
WELL, IT IS SO.

88
00:03:35,563 --> 00:03:37,065
IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH GOOINGLING

89
00:03:37,065 --> 00:03:39,834
AND LOOKING AROUND TO FIND WE

90
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:43,304
DID CONSUME A LOT OF HORSE MEAT

91
00:03:43,304 --> 00:00:00,000
IN THE UNITED STATES.
