ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland
FIFA president Sepp Blatter resigns, just
days after being re-elected for a fifth term.
His resignation follows the indictment of
several FIFA officials for money laundering,
fraud, and racketeering.
The U.S. is investigating whether bribery
played a part in the Russia and Qatar World
Cup bids.
Blatter is a focus of the investigation, but
denies corruption allegations.
An extraordinary FIFA congress will meet in
December 2015 to elect a new president.
