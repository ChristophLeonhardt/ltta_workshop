00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
the president tweeted about one of the
options on the table trade here's the

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,770
tweet from the president just a few
hours ago

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,570
he writes quote the United States is
considering in addition to other options

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,960
stopping all trade with any country
doing business with North Korea earlier

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,500
today Treasury secretary Steve monition
was on the Sunday morning talk shows

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,390
saying that he was prepared to draft a
sanctions package that would include

7
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,329
that kind of language listen to more of
what he said we're we're gonna strongly

8
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,610
consider everything at this point and
again I will draft a package for his

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,410
strong consideration that would go as
far as cutting off all trade or other

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,510
business and this behavior is
unacceptable and if countries want to do

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,739
business with the United States they
obviously will be working with our

12
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,640
allies and others to cut off North Korea
economically now one way to read this

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,090
tweet fred is a direct call to action to
China experts even within the White

14
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:13,590
House estimate that trade with North
Korea amounts 90% of it comes from China

15
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,240
so this is a way to essentially call
China out perhaps threaten them in some

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,320
veiled way you'll recall back during the
2016 election the president was

17
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,240
outspoken saying that he felt that China
should do more to rein in kim jeong-hoon

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,090
he later on expressed frustration that
china wasn't doing more and earlier

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,740
today before this tweet in a separate
one he said that china was embarrassed

20
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,040
by north korea carrying out this nuclear
test we have yet to hear a direct

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,460
response from the president other than
these tweets we will of course bring it

22
00:01:47,460 --> 00:00:00,000
to you when he does respond
