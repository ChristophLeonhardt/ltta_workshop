3
00:00:03,968 --> 00:00:05,569
PASTOR BRUNSON'S RELEASE, THE

4
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:07,003
EFFORTS SAY TONIGHT THAT THEY

5
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:08,238
ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

6
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:09,306
OTHER AMERICANS STILL DETAINED

7
00:00:09,307 --> 00:00:09,973
IN TURKEY.

8
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:11,742
AS WELL AS POTENTIAL CRISIS

9
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:13,343
BREWING RIGHT NOW WITH SAUDI

10
00:00:13,344 --> 00:00:13,677

HERE WITH MORE IS THE ILLINOIS

00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,681
CONGRESSMAN KINSINGER, THE

REPUBLICAN AND MEMBER OF THE

WELCOME.

>> THANKS.

18
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:22,619
>> WE'LL GET TO SAUDI ARABIA

19
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,020
IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST TALK

20
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:25,155
ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

21
00:00:25,156 --> 00:00:27,457
PRESIDENT GETTING PASTOR

22
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:31,628
BRUNSON OUT WITHOUT PAYING

23
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:31,995
RANSOM.

24
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:34,164
A FEW MONTHS AGO I WAS ON DUTY

25
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,833
WHEN HE WAS WITH HOLT RELEASED

26
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:39,202
FROM A PRISON AND THAT IS

27
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:41,071
WITHOUT THE U.S. PAYING MONEY.

28
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,572
TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE.

29
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:43,707
>> THIS IS AMAZING.

30
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,742
IF YOU THINK OF THE PRIOR

31
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:46,543
ADMINISTRATION WHAT WAS PAID

32
00:00:46,544 --> 00:00:47,444
TO GET PEOPLE BACK.

33
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:49,279
DOING THIS, THE PRESIDENT

34
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,413
TRUMP UNDERSTANDS ONE THING

35
00:00:50,414 --> 00:00:51,782
ABOUT THE U.S. POWER.

36
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:53,450
THAT THERE IS U.S. POWER.

37
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,718
THAT WE ARE THE LARGEST

38
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,653
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

39
00:00:56,654 --> 00:00:58,288
THE BIGGEST MILITARY.

40
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,292
WE HAVE ARROWS IN THE QUIBER

41
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:03,593
TO USE.

42
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:05,695
SO TO TAKE A TOUGH STAND, A

43
00:01:05,696 --> 00:01:08,765
LOT OF PEOPLE WERE UPSET AND

44
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:12,035
SAYING HE WILL SANCTION TURKEY

45
00:01:12,036 --> 00:01:12,903
UNTIL THEY RELEASE OUR

46
00:01:12,904 --> 00:01:13,236
CITIZEN.

47
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:14,738
HE WILL GET A TON OF CREDIT

48
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:15,839
FOR THIS AND CELEBRATED

49
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,273
TOMORROW.

50
00:01:16,274 --> 00:01:19,142
>> WE TRIED TO DO RESEARCH

51
00:01:19,143 --> 00:01:19,509
TODAY.

52
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,311
THIS IS MURKY HOW MANY

53
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:22,412
AMERICANS ARE DETAINED IN A

54
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:23,213
PLACE LIKE TURKEY.

55
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:24,514
AMERICANS ARE DETAINED ALL

56
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:25,549
AROUND THE WORLD AND WE PRAY

57
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,449
FOR THEM EVERY DAY.

58
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,083
WE SHOULD.

59
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:28,418
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW

60
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:29,686
MANY AMERICANS ARE STILL IN

61
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:34,925
TURKEY BEYOND PASTOR BRUNSON?

62
00:01:34,926 --> 00:01:36,226
>> I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER BUT

63
00:01:36,227 --> 00:01:37,561
SOME ARE A LOT.

64
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:40,664
SOME OF THEM CAN BE FOR

65
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:42,766
LEGITIMATE REASONS BUT SOME

66
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,100
ARE ILLEGITIMATE REASON.

67
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:46,837
THE PASTOR WAS ILLEGITIMATE

68
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:47,671
REASON.

69
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,106
IT WAS A PREPOSTEROUS TRIAL.

70
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:51,408
BUT THE PRESIDENT MAKES IT

71
00:01:51,409 --> 00:01:53,176
CLEAR THERE IS A COST TO

72
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:54,711
ILLEGALLY DETAINING THE

73
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:56,012
AMERICAN CITIZENS.

74
00:01:56,013 --> 00:01:57,314
IT HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT.

75
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,749
NOT JUST TURKEY BUT OTHER

76
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,587
COUNTRIES LOOK AT THIS SAYING

77
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:05,021
DO WE GET LEVERAGE DETAIN AN

78
00:02:05,022 --> 00:02:06,923
AMERICAN ILLEGALLY OR DOES IT

79
00:02:06,924 --> 00:02:07,991
COST US MORE?

80
00:02:07,992 --> 00:02:09,359
>> I WANT TO GO TO SAUDI

81
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,693
ARABIA.

82
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,361
YOU MENTIONED THE AMERICAN

83
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:11,661
POWER.

84
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:12,629
THE PRESIDENT IS UNDER

85
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,463
PRESSURE TONIGHT.

86
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:14,331
HE WILL GET CONGRATULATIONS

87
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:15,899
FOR BRINGING PASTOR BRUNSON

88
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,601
HOME BUT HE IS UNDER PRESSURE

89
00:02:17,602 --> 00:02:20,036
TO DO MORE TO DEAL WITH SAUDI

90
00:02:20,037 --> 00:02:21,638
ARABIA AND FIND OUT WHAT

91
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,505
HAPPENED TO JAMAL KHASHOGGI,

92
00:02:22,506 --> 00:02:24,741
THE JOURNALIST WHO DISAPPEARED

93
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:28,144
AND SOME FEAR HE HAS BEEN

94
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:28,578
MURDERED.

95
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,313
THE TURKS SAY SAUDI ARABIA

96
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:31,381
PLANNED THIS OUT AND KILLED

97
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:31,748
HIM.

98
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,083
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

99
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,217
>> EVERYTHING SEEMS LIKE THAT

100
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:35,085
IS CORRECT.

101
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:36,753
TURKEY HAS BEEN

102
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:37,220
FORWARD-LEANING.

103
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:38,455
WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE HAD

104
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:38,955
EVIDENCE.

105
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:40,290
THEY PLAYED THE EVIDENCE.

106
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,358
I HAVEN'T HEARD IT.

107
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,959
IT'S DISGUSTING IF IT'S TRUE.

108
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,561
AND IT APPEARS TO BE TRUE.

109
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,029
BUT I THINK WHAT IS IMPORTANT

110
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,565
HERE IS TO TAKE THE BROAD

111
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:49,466
INTERNATIONAL POLL TUCKS OF

112
00:02:49,467 --> 00:02:51,701
THIS AND PUT IT IN CONTEXT.

113
00:02:51,702 --> 00:02:53,770
KEEP IN MIND, RUSSIANS

114
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:57,774
POISONED PEOPLE IN THE UNITED

115
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:58,475
KINGDOM.

116
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:00,510
ASAD, IRAN AND RUSSIA KILLED

117
00:03:00,511 --> 00:03:01,378
500,000 SYRIANS.

118
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:03,313
SO THIS IS NOT EXCUSING.

119
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:04,281
THERE NEEDS TO BE A COST TO

120
00:03:04,282 --> 00:03:04,648
THAT.

121
00:03:04,649 --> 00:03:06,483
BUT SOME OF THE SENATORS THAT

122
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:07,617
HAVE BEEN PINING FOR YEARS TO

123
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:08,985
CUT OFF ANY AID TO SAUDI

124
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:10,287
ARABIA FOR SOME REASON ARE

125
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:12,355
USING THIS AS THE IMPETUS TO

126
00:03:12,356 --> 00:03:14,257
SAY THIS IS THE REASON TO NOW

127
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,926
BASICALLY CUT OFF ALL AID, CUT

128
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:17,594
OFF RELATIONSHIPS WITH SAUDI

129
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:19,162
ARABIA IS AN OVERREACTION.

130
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:19,963
>> 30 SECONDS.

131
00:03:19,964 --> 00:03:21,665
ONE SENATOR IS LINDSEY GRAHAM.

132
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:23,166
HE SAID THERE SHOULD BE A

133
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:25,168
BIPARTISAN TSUNAMI HE CALLS IT

134
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:28,772
IF IN FACT SAUDI WAS BEHIND

135
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,073
THE DISAPPEARANCE AND

136
00:03:30,074 --> 00:03:30,774
POTENTIAL MURDER.

137
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,175
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

138
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:33,410
YOU SAY DON'T CUT OFF AID.

139
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,178
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE ARMS SALES?

140
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,847
OVER $100 BILLION IN ARMY

141
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:38,281
SALES?

142
00:03:38,282 --> 00:03:39,516
>> THE ARM SALES IS A BIG

143
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:40,617
THING TO THINK ABOUT BEFORE WE

144
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:41,351
HANDLE THERE.

145
00:03:41,352 --> 00:03:44,587
THERE ARE BIG IMPLICATIONS.

146
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:47,657
I HAVE RESPECT FOR LINDSEY

147
00:03:47,658 --> 00:03:48,024
GRAHAM.

148
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,125
THERE SHOULD BE SANCTIONS BUT

149
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:51,328
WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL BEFORE

150
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,829
WE MAKE MASSIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS

151
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,730
AND END THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

152
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,197
SAUDI ARABIA.

153
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:56,366
I WOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS

154
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:57,267
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

155
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:58,568
>> GET THE FACTS BEFORE TAKING

156
00:03:58,569 --> 00:00:00,000
ACTION.
