Arty's correspondent Paulus Lea has been suddenly denied entry to Ukraine as she was stopped at the border issue was heading to an OSCE conference dedicated to that of press freedom let's cross live now to Paula who's standing by for us at the moment Paula good to see you can you tell us what's happened at the border I was all here about 40 minutes ago I don't actually know what's going on they've brought me my luggage they've kicked my passport and they're told in just two ways yet at this point are going to have any flying out of the plane I was supposed to leave here me tomorrow after this conference and I was participating in and there's no one around actually talked I was waiting for some time the officials come for them and when I came around and see if somebody can help me though I'm failing that they said we haven't been very forthcoming with information the only thing they told me was that they received a notice from above that I would not allow it in the country they gave me some papers to sign that I was into the invitation people and they said I'm not allowed back in the country for another five years and this is despite the fact that I have given them the details of the conference I was planning to participate in today's conference organized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe it's dedicated to the freedom and morality in Ukraine as you say you're at the departure lounge now you're sitting in limbo they've taken your passport you said the guards were not too unfriendly but you also mentioned they made you sign a document written in Ukrainian did they force you to sign the document do they offer you a translation to be honest having to ask for translation the way they presented it was that there is no other alternatives the official proceeding with me basically said disobey them from entering this country we have orders from about to tell you to sign here it's basically said that I have explained to you that do not allow any plane and the are being refused issue for the next five years and say what unsigned essentially was a copy explained of what we in South or something and then I asked about my baggage they took me to them with my baggage and then they've often here so I'm essentially sitting there are in the department now there is no one around and actually ignored everything like the border guards they told you that this is coming from above did they explain what authorized the governmental body that has denied you access no they didn't I wasn't cleaning up a linear the painter who played because I was unluckiest previously but we did do our homework we muster the disc-shaped if I'm on any of these like this and I'm not going like this which is like before that if you okay and need to come into Ukraine I haven't been here since 2015 in and out I'll go into that in a moment but as far as I know I'm not in any blackness Muffy and person who is in the peace entry and is being deported is another Russian journalist as well the came in the Showtime afternoon and previously than his marching orders he was actually told custody within 20 minutes he was told every was not allowed and they keep about an hour and a half and I did ask what was going on what was happening and it is asking to keep waiting and waiting now back in 2014 I have time to kill two especially higher that are broken up in the Chernobyl Egypt they helped me nothing really playing in comfort and while I was reporting on that I was to think from a tips of my location and in which time started with sinful irritated listen please and fix it started circulating online I started receiving it from our bodies as incredibly they were going to the dating they threatened that they would find my family that certain that if I need acne darling I'm about quality needed attention to pull me off of here as quickly as possible that is the last time I wasn't even as I say I won't be allowed back at least now for another five years so blacklist hood for another five years as you say you were just describing what happened to you back in 2015 in Ukraine where you had some interesting experiences do we know what's what's going to happen next Porter you're sitting there in limbo your passport is no longer in your position possession oh what's what's next for you paulus lire they're ultimately stuck at the Kiev International Airport now her passport has been seized and well she's in the midst of being deported it's a bizarre especially when you think about it she's actually there to attend an OSCE conference on what press freedom well let's get some reaction on this i Reina Roth first Sergio political analyst now are joining us live here on RT International thanks for jumping on so quickly how legitimate is it to deny a journalist access like this without even providing an explanation well it's not at all that you do met of course but it just shows how much the propaganda against Russian media has worked in Ukraine in the past russian-speaking media are forbidden in that country where Russian is a very important language of course for half of the population and it shows that the government in Ukraine has not yet changed its policies this is a tenth of OSCE to promote freedom of speech freedom of media in Ukraine is a very good initiative but of course it will not work if Ukraine is not willing to tackle this challenge where it hurts the country most freedom of speech also for Russian based media and for Russian language media and it's very odd to see that Western governments are not really opposing government of Ukraine in this point they only challenge always Russia in yeah respecting the Minsk agreement etc but they are not putting enough pressure on the Ukrainian government in these aspects well a poutine has repeatedly called on a various European officials to pressure Kiev to implement further aspects of the Minsk Accord as you just mentioned there now Paulus Leah was saying in her state of deportation that her she was instructed to assign a document that was written in Ukraine the documents saying Ukrainians say the documents saying that she was a denied access on the orders of an authorized government body but that was all with no name or anything who might that have been and why do you think well that's not clear to me which government body this could have been I myself have been placed on the merits Ward's kill list in 2017 after my visit to the Crimea Peninsula after I had given a press conference there and this minute warrants list for example is composed by private initiatives but which is closely linked also to the Ministry of Interior and it has the backing of some parliament members and also by as EU as the side claims so it remains very murky unclear who stands behind such initiatives but the important point is that we will see no clear opposition no clear pressure on behalf of the Western governments who financed partly Ukrainian government who gives backing to the Ukrainian government's we will not see this pressure which will end such actions and this is very pitiful of course well uh RT we've got a bit of a bad history in Ukraine when it comes to your correspondents going down there certainly more than a couple of our employees have have bumped into brick walls in Ukraine when trying to cover certain stories a Paula as we know was heading to the OSCE conference on the freedom of the press and here she is working for RT International what does that say to you we kind of the state of affairs in Ukraine they're having an international conference on the freedom of the press and then an RT correspondent gets bagged and then gets deported well I think it's a really desolate situation in which we find now the freedom of press and it's the point that the government in Ukraine should tackle first to re-establish also trust in its own behavior its own policies in Ukraine but once again they prove that they cannot really face this challenge as of course there are facts to be hidden away from public and this is of course a very very sad to see that developments don't go in that direction that freedom of press is respected that the background of the conflict is covered up and this would be a prerequisite for solving it and trust-building has not been promoted by this move of the Ukrainian government at all and right now would you expect any international reaction to this or not of course I would respect expect this reaction not only on behalf of the governments but also on behalf of for example reporters without borders they should clearly make that statement that this is unacceptable that a government interferes in such a way because these conferences where standards of freedom of speech freedom of press are negotiated are the basic point of departure for promoting those freedoms also in their respective countries that need these improvements and I think that the OSCE cannot at all be blamed of being partial in this respect they just seek security in countries where there are tensions and to seek security also means to bring to light in justices and can do that if not the press and the press needs a freedom to do its work and to allow also policymakers to find the right judgments to solve those problems so I think this was really a very bad move of the Ukrainian government it will fall back negatively on them as soon as the Reporters Without Borders organisations of that kind will come up with their statements but as I said before I do not expect that the EU for example the United States or that any Western European government will harshly criticize the Ukrainian government for doing so they are too partial in this conflict I am afraid
