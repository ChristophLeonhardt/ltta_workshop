Can you imagine 24 hours
without heartburn?
>> Shannon: MOST OF THE
PROTESTERS KILLED THIS WEEK BY
ISRAELI FIRE ALONG THE
GAZA STRIP WERE MEMBERS OF
HAMAS.
THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE
TERRORIST GROUP ITSELF.
MEANWHILE TONIGHT, THERE'S NEW
FOOTAGE FROM INSIDE GAZA REFUGEE
CAMP THAT PURPORTS TO SHOW
INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE BY A
UNITED NATIONS AGENCY THAT RUNS
SCHOOLS AND OTHER OPERATIONS IN
THE PALESTINIAN REFUGEE CAMPS.
WITH THE HELP OF MILLIONS OF
YOUR U.S. TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
THEY ARE VEHEMENTLY DENIED THE
ALLEGATIONS AND SAID THE REPORT
THIS TIME IS ALL WRONG.
GARRETT TENNEY IS DIGGING INTO
IT TONIGHT TRYING TO GET THE
FACTS.
HE JOINS US LIVE.
>> WE RECEIVE THIS EXCLUSIVE
VIDEO FROM AN ISRAELI AMERICAN
JOURNALIST WENT INTO BECAUSE OF
THIS WEEK TO SHOW HOW THE U.N.
RELIEF AGENCY IS ALLEGEDLY
ENCOURAGING PALESTINIAN CHILDREN
TO TAKE PART IN THESE DEADLY
RIOTS.
>> THIS IS PURPORTEDLY THE
SCHOOL ASSEMBLY IN GAZA AHEAD OF
MONDAY'S VIOLENT CLASHES ON THE
BORDER.
THE JOURNALISTS CLAIM THE SCHOOL
IS RUN BY THE U.N. RELIEF AGENCY
BUT WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY
VERIFY THAT ANY OF THE CLAIMS IN
THE VIDEO.
THEY PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN AID TO
MILLIONS OF REFUGEES ACROSS THE
MIDDLE EAST INCLUDING SCHOOLS
AND HOSPITALS.
LET THE AGENCY HAS ALSO BEEN
CRITICIZED BY ISRAELI AND U.S.
LAWMAKERS FOR TEACHING
ANTI-ISRAEL AND ANTI-SEMITIC
VIEWS AND ITS SCHOOLS.
THIS NEW VIDEO COULD FUEL THOSE
ALLEGATIONS BECAUSE IT ALLEGES
STUDENTS ARE BEING TAUGHT THEY
HAVE THE RIGHT TO RETURN TO THE
LANDS TAKEN BY ISRAEL AND CLAIM
THEM BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.
SPEAK WITH THE U.N. AGENCY TELLS

PARTICIPATING IN THE MARCHES IN
GAZA.
IN 2013 IN RESPONSE TO ANOTHER
FILM BY THE SAME JOURNALIST,
THEY CONDEMNED ANTI-SEMITIC
STATEMENTS STUDENTS MADE ON
CAMERA AND DEFENDED ITS WORK IN
THE REGION SAYING WE REJECT IN
NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THE
ALLEGATIONS THAT WE PROMOTE
INCITEMENT AND THE NOTION THAT
WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIEWS
EXPRESSED IN THE FILM.
THEY ARE COMMITTED TO FOSTERING
HUMAN RIGHTS AND TOLERANCE.
IN TERMS OF FUNDING, THE U.S.
GIVES MORE THAN $360 MILLION TO
UNRWA EVERY YEAR WHICH IS MORE
THAN THE NEXT FOUR HIGHEST
COUNTRIES COMBINED.
HOWEVER, IN JANUARY, THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED IT WAS
WITHHOLDING AN INITIAL
$65 MILLION OF THE FUNDING
BECAUSE THE U.S. WANTS TO SEE
REVISIONS AND HOW THE AGENCY
OPERATES.
>> Shannon: THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
LET'S DIG A LITTLE FURTHER INTO
THIS AGENCY.
FOR THE REFUGEES IN PALESTINE.
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM
COLORADO SITS ON THE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE AND JOINS US
LIVE.
LET ME START BY GETTING YOUR
REACTION.
THIS COMES FROM AN ISRAELI
FILMMAKER.
WE CAN'T INDEPENDENTLY VERIFY
IT.
HE SAYS THAT IT IS, THESE ARE
SCHOOLS, AGENCIES LINKED TO
UNRWA WHICH GETS MILLIONS AND
U.S. TAXPAYER DOLLARS EVERY YEAR
U.S. TAXPAYER DOLLARS EVERY YEA
YEAR.
THEY ARE DENYING THEY ARE
ANTI-SEMITIC.

>> THE RESEARCH          RESEARA
GOOD WORK, REVEALING FACTS.
CONGRESS NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE
AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.
I BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP DID
THE RIGHT THING BY WITHHOLDING
THE MONEY, AS WE JUST STATED.
THAT'S GOING TO GET THE
ATTENTION HOPEFULLY OF THE
UNITED NATIONS.
>> Shannon: I WAS OVER THERE
EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WE SAT
DOWN WITH THE CHIEF NEGOTIATOR
FOR THE PALESTINIANS.
HE TALKED ABOUT, HE WAS OUTRAGED
ABOUT THE MONEY BEING WITHHELD
AND TALKED ABOUT HOW IT GOES FOR
FOOD AND EDUCATION AND
HEALTH CARE AND ALL KINDS OF
THINGS.
IF THESE PEOPLE ARE DESPERATE,
AND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY THE
MONEY, MAKES THEM MORE
DESPERATE.
HIS ARGUMENT WAS IT LEAVES THEM
TO BECOME RADICALIZED.
IF THEY HAVE NOTHING TO EXIST
ON.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT
ARGUMENT?
>> THEY SAY THEY ARE PROVIDING
HUMANITARIAN AID, BUT THEY ADMIT
THEY USE THE TEXTBOOKS THAT THE
P.A. USES, PALESTINIAN
AUTHORITY, AND THOSE TEXTBOOKS
GLORIFY MARTYRDOM.
URGES THE VIOLENT TAKEOVER OF
ISRAEL BY THE RIGHT OF RETURN.
IT GLORIFIES TERRORISM.
AND IT DOES ALL THE WRONG THINGS
THAT POISON THE MINDS OF THE
CHILDREN THAT ARE NOW SO
ANTI-ISRAEL AND ANTI-JEWISH.
>> Shannon: I WANT TO READ A
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT WE GOT FROM
-- GARRETT HAD INFORMATION.
FROM THE SPOKESMAN.
"AS A NEUTRAL AGENCY, UNRWA IS
COMMITTED TO NONVIOLENCE IN THE
HIGHEST STANDARDS OF NEUTRALITY.
OR A CONDEMNATION OF YOUR RACISM
INCLUDING ANTI-SEMITISM IS A
MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD."
IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH?
>> NO.
WE NEED TO DO RESEARCH,
CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION.
THERE WAS AN OBAMA ERA REPORT
THAT WAS DONE ON UNRWA AND THE
NUMBER OF VERY FEW JEWS BUT THAT
WAS CLASSIFIED BY THE
STATE DEPARTMENT, HAS NOT BEEN
RELEASED.
TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT ARE NOT
BEING TOLD TO US.
>> Shannon: I MENTION THE TOP
PALESTINIAN NEGOTIATOR.
HIS NIECE WHO IS HERE AS A
PROFESSOR I THINK AT GEORGE
MASON.
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.
SHE WROTE A PIECE ON THE SAME
SINCE ITS INCEPTION UNRWA HAS
TRIED TO REMAIN IMPARTIAL AMID
FIGHTING, VIOLENCE AND TURMOIL
CONCENTRATING ON HELPING
PALESTINIANS IN NEED REGARDLESS
OF THEIR POLITICS.
FOOD, WATER, HEALTH CARE, THOSE
KINDS OF THINGS.
THAT IS HER TAKE ON IT.
>> I HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE
TEXTBOOKS THAT HAVE BEEN
RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.
TO MYSELF AND OTHER CONGRESSMEN.
IT'S HORRIBLE.
THIS IS INCITEMENT TO VIOLENCE.
THIS IS POISONING THE MINDS OF
THE NEXT GENERATION.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE PEOPLE
GOING TO THE FENCE AND GETTING
KILLED.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE, I WAS THE
HOUSE SPONSOR TELLING THE
PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY DON'T TAKE
U.S. TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND GIVE
IT TWO TERRORISTS WERE NOW IN
PRISON, PAYING THEM A LOT MORE
THAN THEY WOULD EVER MAKE IN THE
CIVILIAN SECTOR OF THEIR
COUNTRY.
OR THE SURVIVING FAMILIES IF
THEY GET KILLED.
THIS IS AN INCITEMENT TO
TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE AND DEATH
TERRORISM AND VIOLENCE AND DEAT
DEATH.
THE P.A. IS DOING THAT RIGHT NOW
ON THAT FRONT AS WELL.
>> Shannon: THERE ARE MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF U.S. TAXPAYER
DOLLARS INVOLVED SO IT SOUNDS
LIKE IT DOES WARN CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATION.
PLEASE LET US KNOW IF THAT
