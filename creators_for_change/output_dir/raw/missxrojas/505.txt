3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,220

have because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the set so as one</font>

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,730
of the many sets and these are my 3d

6
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,440
glasses from Toy Story 3 which by the

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,009
way I Judaism my 3d glasses from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Avatar</font>

8
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:16,049
but I recycled them and use them for toy

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,270
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 moving on anecdote kind of day</font>

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the doctor was a woman which could</font>

14
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,070
happen potential in the future births

15
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,050
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> another video as I was signing out</font>

16
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the surgery</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I overheard a</font>

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,539
conversation that went something like

18
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,430
this a secretary you'd evidently been

19
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,020
locked up in a room all day and hasn't

20
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,940
ventured outside or had any sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

21
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,010
immense humidity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is going on right</font>

22
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,960
now asked her fairy secretary who just

23
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,670
returned from her lunch break what's it

24
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,040
like outside the second set she said in

25
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,539
a full Beijing turning of gloom and

26
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,690
despair it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those days one of</font>

27
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,670
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inquired the other secretary</font>

28
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,920
with a noticeable tremor of fear the

29
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,530
brave secretary responded<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a flying</font>

30
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:59,850
ant it's a flying ant it's a flying and

31
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,440
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a fly</font>

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,570
I know what she means because every

33
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,610

34
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,380
