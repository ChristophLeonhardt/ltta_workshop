1
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:12,426
DREAM TO DEMOCRATS PROMISED A

2
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:15,262
BLUE WAVE DURING THE 2018

3
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:16,797
MIDTERMS AND AS WE SAW THIS

4
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:17,531
WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP IS READY

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:18,232
TO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY FOR MORE

6
00:00:18,232 --> 00:00:21,502
PACKED TO THE RAFTERS CAMPAIGN

7
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:22,102
RALLY.

8
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:22,970
A LOOK AT THE PRIMARY ELECTIONS

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:25,105
COMING UP THIS WEEK.

10
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:25,773
WITHOUT THEM WE BRING IN OUR

11
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:29,576
TALK RADIO PANEL ROSS KAMINSKY,

12
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:30,344
RADIO HOST OUT OF THE GREAT CITY

13
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:33,514
OF DENVER, COLORADO AND BERLIN

14
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:34,181
MIX IN HERE IN WASHINGTON.

15
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:38,018
NICE TO SEE YOU.

16
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:39,086
THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT IS

17
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:39,853
OUT FOR THESE CAMPAIGN RALLIES

18
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:43,757
IN THE PLACES HE IS GOING AS NO

19
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:44,124
SURPRISE.

20
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:45,259
INDIANA BEFORE THE PRIMARY IN

21
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:48,228
OHIO BEFORE THE PRIMARY THERE.

22
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:48,862
WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT HOW

23
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:55,135
REPUBLICANS ARE VIEWING 2018?

24
00:00:55,135 --> 00:00:55,836
>> I THINK IT SAYS REPUBLICANS

25
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:57,705
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

26
00:00:57,705 --> 00:00:58,405
GET THE VERY PRO-TRAMPLING OF

27
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:01,909
THE PARTY AND THE THE LESS

28
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,043
PRO-TRAMPLING OF THE PARTY TO

29
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:05,012
AGREE ON A CANDIDATE TO THEN

30
00:01:05,012 --> 00:01:05,579
ACCOMPLISH THEIR MORE

31
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:08,282
FUNDAMENTAL MISSION OF BEATING A

32
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:09,183
DEMOCRAT IN NOVEMBER.

33
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:11,218
I THOUGHT THE INDIANA THING IN

34
00:01:11,218 --> 00:01:12,753
PARTICULAR A COUPLE DAYS AGO WAS

35
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:16,824
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT.

36
00:01:16,824 --> 00:01:18,959
LELAND: TO THAT POINT AND WE

37
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:19,693
WILL STAY ON THIS PARTICULARLY

38
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:22,896
IN COLORADO THIS IS AN ISSUE IN

39
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:23,764
2010 WHEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

40
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:25,566
PICKED SOMEBODY SO FAR TO THE

41
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:28,168
RIGHT THAT IT MADE AN EASY RACE

42
00:01:28,168 --> 00:01:28,569
UNWINNABLE.

43
00:01:28,569 --> 00:01:30,571
YOU SEE THAT PLAYING OUT AGAIN

44
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:33,474
FOR HIS PRESIDENT TRUMP THE

45
00:01:33,474 --> 00:01:34,808
ABILITY -- HAVE THE ABILITY TO

46
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:36,944
BRING THOSE TWO PARTS OF THE

47
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:37,478
PARTY TOGETHER?

48
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:40,080
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

49
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,814
WE'VE SEEN THAT A FEW TIMES IN

50
00:01:40,814 --> 00:01:41,181
COLORADO.

51
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:45,019
IF YOU PREPARE WEST VIRGINIA AND

52
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:45,686
OHIO AND INDIANA, YOU SEE A

53
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:49,957
REPUBLICAN ALIKE DREAD THAT'S

54
00:01:49,957 --> 00:01:50,424
FAIRLY RATIONAL.

55
00:01:50,424 --> 00:01:52,026
I THINK YOU SAW A GUY WHO

56
00:01:52,026 --> 00:01:52,960
COULDN'T WADE IN NOVEMBER ARE

57
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,562
LOSING WEST VIRGINIA WHEREAS A

58
00:01:55,562 --> 00:01:59,867
BUSINESSMAN AND INDIANA BEAT TO

59
00:01:59,867 --> 00:02:01,835
IT, CONGRESSMAN, MAYBE THEY

60
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:02,870
SPLIT THE VOTE, BUT IN THE CASE

61
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,506
YOU ARE SEEING REPUBLICANS BEEN

62
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:06,240
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEVER THAN

63
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,411
THEY HAVE IN THE PAST.

64
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:11,178
LELAND: NOTEWORTHY IN WEST

65
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:11,912
VIRGINIA THE PRESIDENT CAME ON

66
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,514
AND SAID THE CANDIDATE YOU ARE

67
00:02:13,514 --> 00:02:14,248
TALKING ABOUT ISN'T GOING TO WIN

68
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:16,350
IN NOVEMBER.

69
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,351
THEY'LL VOTE FOR ONE OF THE

70
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:20,354
OTHER TWO GUYS AND PEOPLE

71
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:20,687
LISTEN.

72
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:21,922
I WILL FLIP THE QUESTION AROUND.

73
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:23,991
AS WE SEE MORE AND MORE

74
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,260
PROGRESSIVES RUNNING IN THESE

75
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,061
PRIMARIES, SOME WITH MORE THAN A

76
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:27,661
DOZEN CANDIDATES ON THE

77
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:30,731
DEMOCRATIC SIDE.

78
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:32,366
IF THEY'RE THE SAME RISK ON THE

79
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:33,300
DEMOCRATIC SIDE THAT YOU'LL END

80
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,502
UP WITH SUCH PROGRESSIVE AND FAR

81
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:36,937
LEFT CANDIDATE THAT THEY MAY BE

82
00:02:36,937 --> 00:02:38,872
GREAT FOR THE BASE, BUT TERRIBLE

83
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:39,940
COME NOVEMBER.

84
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,944
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

85
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:44,478
LELAND: REALLY?

86
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:46,013
>> THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO

87
00:02:46,013 --> 00:02:47,047
SHOW WHAT APPEARED THE QUESTION

88
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:51,051
IS IN WHAT NUMBERS.

89
00:02:51,051 --> 00:02:52,219
LELAND: WHAT DEMOCRATS, WHAT

90
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:52,986
DEMOCRATS, WHAT DEMOCRATS FROM A

91
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:53,720
PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT THAN FAR

92
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,388
LEFT DEMOCRATS ARE THE MORE

93
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:55,889
MODERATE DEMOCRATS?

94
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:57,925
>> PART OF IT IS A CERTAIN

95
00:02:57,925 --> 00:02:58,625
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

96
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,359
ANTI-TRUMP THE WILL SHOW UP AND

97
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,929
VOTE DEMOCRAT.

98
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:02,663
THE QUESTION FOR THE DEMOCRATS

99
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:03,397
IS GOING TO BE THIS.

100
00:03:03,397 --> 00:03:07,167
AT SOME TIME BETWEEN NOW AND THE

101
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:07,935
MIDTERMS, WHETHER THEY ARE GOING

102
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:11,839
TO COME UP WITH A CONCRETE

103
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:12,773
ECONOMIC POLICY AS OPPOSED TO

104
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:16,610
SIMPLY RUN A NON-WE ARE NOT

105
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:19,246
TRUMP BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UPSET

106
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:19,746
AND ANGRY.

107
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:21,281
RIGHT NOW BOTH PARTIES, THE

108
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:21,949
REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS SHIFTED

109
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:25,085
FROM A TOP-DOWN TOTALLY TO

110
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:26,820
FOREIGN POLICY.

111
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,656
WHICHEVER PARTY GOES BACK TO

112
00:03:29,656 --> 00:03:30,958
ECONOMIC POLICY AND FOCUSES ON

113
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:31,725
THAT GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS, IT

114
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:33,260
HAS A LOT OF SUCCESS.

115
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,664
LELAND: JAMES CARVILLE IS THAT

116
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:41,001
IT'S THE ECONOMY,.

117
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:43,537
LOOK AT THE GENERIC HOLE RIGHT

118
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:47,307
NOW FROM CBS NEWS DID REPUBLICAN

119
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:49,476
41%, DEMOCRATS 50%.

120
00:03:49,476 --> 00:03:54,748
UNSURE, NO ANSWER 3%.

121
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:55,816
DOES IT SCARE YOU A LITTLE BIT

122
00:03:55,816 --> 00:03:58,285
THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE AT NINE

123
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:01,622
POINTS UNDERWATER IN THIS?

124
00:04:01,622 --> 00:04:02,756
>> YES AND NO.

125
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:03,490
OF COURSE IF YOU ARE REPUBLICAN,

126
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,627
IT WOULD SCARE YOU AND FOR THE

127
00:04:06,627 --> 00:04:07,361
RECORD I'M UNAFFILIATED THAT I

128
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:08,028
TEND TO LEAN TO THE RIGHT A

129
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:10,864
LITTLE BIT.

130
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:13,167
I ALSO SEE POSITIVE TRENDS IN

131
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:13,767
VARIOUS GENERIC POLLS,

132
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,468
REPUBLICANS DOING BETTER THAN

133
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:19,005
THEY HAD IN THE PAST.

134
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:19,673
REGARDING THE COMMENT ABOUT

135
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:20,406
FOREIGN POLICY, I THINK THE JOB

136
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:22,409
ALL IN ALL THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS

137
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:23,977
IN NORTH KOREA.

138
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:25,312
YOU DON'T ONLY HAVE THESE

139
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:28,048
ELECTIONS ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY

140
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:29,550
UNLESS YOU ARE AT WAR.

141
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,951
THIS COULD BE AN OUTLIER AS

142
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:31,985
PRESIDENT TRUMP DOES SOMETHING

143
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,922
REMARKABLE WITH NORTH KOREA, AND

144
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:36,156
THE KOREAN WAR AND STARTS

145
00:04:36,156 --> 00:04:38,492
TOWARDS DENUCLEARIZATION.

146
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:42,296
I CAN HAVE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT.

147
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:43,063
LELAND: WE HAVE SEEN DEMOCRATS

148
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:43,697
ON ACROSS THE BOARD, BUT A

149
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:47,100
NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS IN THE WORDS

150
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,969
OF ONE YESTERDAY BUT DIDN'T KILL

151
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:49,636
THE UNIT GOT TO GIVE CREDIT

152
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:52,272
WHERE CREDIT IS DUE ABOUT

153
00:04:52,272 --> 00:00:00,000
BRINGING HOSTAGES HOME.
