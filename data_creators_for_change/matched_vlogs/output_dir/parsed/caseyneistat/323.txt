and then oh and did you want to get uh
did you want to get a little pop below
though I saw that that's really weird
right like 4:00 in the morning
hotels dig quiet everything's shut down
we drag our bags in the check-in go to
hotel room wake up this morning and I
really just left our car like just left
it in front of the hotel
it was either stolen it was towed or
maybe the hotel got it and found my keys
that I left somewhere and that's exactly
what happened I had like apparently left
my keys in the counter where I checked
in they found the keys we're like what's
this card they
Brook one that's belts on the pokey
board man I'm only at half power this
morning he's gotta be up by now I'm
gonna go back and see if he's this is a
weed store weed is legal in Colorado
this is a legal weed store so this
inside of a week stores are super
friendly in here it's really fancy
these are definitely weed edibles
cookies other cookies gummies
paraphernalia here these are like
candies don't know what these are cookie
go
we drink of some sort and look how fancy
this is the that's the marijuana there
and this tells you about it this is like
the Apple store of weed that was cool
it's like super professional down there
I'd like mega fancy the thing that
didn't film was there was like an armed
guard who's like a very sweet lovely
woman it was totally polite and cordial
it was like an Apple store but instead
of iPads they sold weed I feel like I
can't do a whole segment on a weed store
without sharing my position on it I
think it should be legal I think it's
stupid that it's not oh hey boy

through the mountains to Utah

that before he left before he left his
mom's house that his relatives were
coming over everybody's crying because
they were so sad he was leaving maybe
because this is so fun and exciting I
haven't gotten sad yet I also haven't
given that much thought yet but my
little boy is all grown up and he's
going to cop yeah it hasn't really hit
