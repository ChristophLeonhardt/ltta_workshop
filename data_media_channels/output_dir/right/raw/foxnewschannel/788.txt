1
00:00:01,042 --> 00:00:02,743
HAD TO SAY, YOU WOULD THINK,

2
00:00:02,743 --> 00:00:06,581
YEAH, CHARLES IS RIGHT.

3
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:10,551
[LAUGHTER]

4
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:11,119
I'M GOING TO BRING IN

5
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:11,853
DANA PERINO WHO IS JOINING US ON

6
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:12,220
THE PHONE.

7
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,622
GOOD EVENING TO YOU.

8
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:16,190
>> THANK YOU, MARTHA, I'VE HAD A

9
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:19,427
CHANCE TO BE ON THIS         ON

10

CHANCE TO BE ON THIS         ONH

CHANCE TO BE ON THIS         ONP

00:00:20,928 --> 00:00:20,962
CHANCE TO BE ON THIS         ONO

14
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:21,429
CHANCE TO BE ON THIS         ONE

15
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:24,632
CHANCE TO BE ON THIS         ON.

16
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:26,367
I REMEMBER READING HIM EVERY

17
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:26,701
FRIDAY.

18
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:29,403
NO MATTER WHAT.

19
00:00:29,403 --> 00:00:30,404
IT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT I

20
00:00:30,404 --> 00:00:32,173
WENT TO AND I DID NOT BOTHER

21
00:00:32,173 --> 00:00:32,907
WITH THE FRONT PAGE EVEN WHEN I

22
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,877
WAS PRESS EDITOR I DIDN'T CARE

23
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:37,044
WHAT WAS ON THE FIRST PAGE.

24
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:38,813
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT CHARLES HAD

25
00:00:38,813 --> 00:00:39,147
WRITTEN.

26
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:42,316
I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN I READ

27
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:42,583
IT.

28
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:46,320
IT WAS ABOUT 5:45 IN THE MORNING

29
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,755
AND I WOULD BE READING IT BEFORE

30
00:00:47,755 --> 00:00:49,524
HE TOOK ME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

31
00:00:49,524 --> 00:00:52,627
WE WOULD GO BACK AND FORTH AND

32
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:53,494
SAY, DID YOU SEE HOW CHARLES

33
00:00:53,494 --> 00:00:55,696
SMOKED HIM TODAY?

34
00:00:55,696 --> 00:00:57,198
WHOEVER IT WAS THAT CHARLES WAS

35
00:00:57,198 --> 00:00:57,598
GOING AFTER.

36
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,967
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOMENTS AT THE

37
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,869
KITCHEN ISLAND I READ THIS

38
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,771
COLUMN, IT WAS THE 2006 I

39
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,908
BELIEVE, IT WAS ABOUT HIS

40
00:01:06,908 --> 00:01:07,808
BROTHER.

41
00:01:07,808 --> 00:01:09,143
IT STILL STICKS WITH ME.

42
00:01:09,143 --> 00:01:11,179
YEARS LATER, I HAD THE

43
00:01:11,179 --> 00:01:12,580
OPPORTUNITY, NOT JUST TO WORK

44
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,415
WITH HIM WHEN I WAS AT THE

45
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:15,616
WHITE HOUSE, BUT CERTAINLY

46
00:01:15,616 --> 00:01:18,853
AFTERWARDS AT FOX NEWS IN

47
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,355
ADDITION, I WORK AS A CONSULTANT

48
00:01:21,355 --> 00:01:22,123
TO THE PUBLISHER THAT HE

49
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,425
EVENTUALLY DID HIS BOOK WITH.

50
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:25,493
I SAID, YOU SHOULD DO A

51
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:25,893
COLLECTION.

52
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:27,295
THE PUBLISHER SAID, IT WILL

53
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,965
NEVER SELL.

54
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,766
USUALLY THE CLIP AND PASTE JOBS

55
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:34,402
DON'T DO THAT WELL.

56
00:01:34,402 --> 00:01:37,171
I SAID, NO, BUT TRUST ME, HE IS

57
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:37,538
DIFFERENT.

58
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:39,707
EVERYONE TRUSTED THEIR CHILDREN

59
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:42,076
OVER WHEN HE IS ABOUT TO TALK.

60
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:45,012
I HAVE TO SAY SELFISHLY, I

61
00:01:45,012 --> 00:01:46,380
WANTED THE BOOK FOR MY OWN

62
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:46,781
COLLECTION.

63
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:49,016
I WANTED TO HAVE IT.

64
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:50,384
IT BECAME A HUGE BEST SELLER.

65
00:01:50,384 --> 00:01:52,420
WHAT I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL

66
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,654
RECENTLY, I HAD FORGOTTEN, HE

67
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:54,956
ACTUALLY READ THE BOOK AS WELL.

68
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:58,292
HE READ THE AUTO BOOK.

69
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:02,196
THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT

70
00:02:02,196 --> 00:02:02,863
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER OVER THE

71
00:02:02,863 --> 00:02:03,598
YEARS THAT WE DID, AND LEARNED

72
00:02:03,598 --> 00:02:05,299
FROM HIM, BUY THAT BOOK AND

73
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,335
LISTEN TO IT.

74
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,338
I LEARNED MORE FROM

75
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,072
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER IN MY LIFE.

76
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,940
AND I TRIED TO CONDUCT MYSELF IN

77
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,944
A WAY THAT, AS YOU TO DESCRIBE,

78
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,813
I HEAR IT IN YOUR VOICE AS WELL.

79
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:21,682
INTEGRITY, HONOR, AND ALSO WITH

80
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:21,949
JOY.

81
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:23,784
HE LOVED HIS LIFE.

82
00:02:23,784 --> 00:02:25,987
HE WOULD ZOOM INTO THE

83
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:26,821
WHITE HOUSE WITH HIS BAND LIKE

84
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:28,589
DALE EARNHARDT JR.

85
00:02:28,589 --> 00:02:30,591
WHEN YOU HAD HIM FOR LUNCH, HE

86
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:31,158
LOVES HOT DOGS AT THE

87
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:32,893
WHITE HOUSE.

88
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:34,428
HE LOVED TO HAVE THE HOTDOCS.

89
00:02:34,428 --> 00:02:34,662
IT WAS A REAL

90
00:02:35,463 --> 00:02:40,101
HONOR TO KNOW HIM.

91
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:41,302
>> Martha: IT IS SO

92
00:02:41,302 --> 00:02:45,206
INTERESTING TO HEAR YOUR IDEA

93
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:45,906
THAT GAVE BIRTH TO HIS BOOK.

94
00:02:45,906 --> 00:02:47,608
I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

95
00:02:47,608 --> 00:02:49,076
I'M READING THE PIECE THAT WAS

96
00:02:49,076 --> 00:02:51,712
WRITTEN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO

97
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:52,313
WHEN CHARLES FIRST GAVE

98
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:54,849
EVERYBODY THE NEWS FROM THE

99
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:55,950
EDITORIAL BOARD AT

100
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,517
"THE WASHINGTON POST."

101
00:02:56,517 --> 00:03:00,021
IN THE FIRST FEW SENTENCES,

102
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:00,821
FRIDAY HAS ALWAYS BEEN CHARLES

103
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:04,959
THE DAY.

104
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,394
THE STRIP ACROSS THE TOP OF THE

105
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,795
PAGE, WE KNEW TO SAVE SPACE ON

106
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:11,132
FRIDAYS PAGE FOUR

107
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:11,999
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER.

108
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:12,900
CHARLES ALWAYS FILLED THE SPACE

109
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,502
WITH JUST THE RIGHT NUMBER OF

110
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:17,038
WORDS.

111
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,473
AT THE MOST ACUTE WORDS TOO.

112
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:21,942
THEY KNEW TO CHECK ANY CHANGE

113
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:22,643
WITH CHARLES BECAUSE HE CARED

114
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,178
ABOUT EVERY WORD.

115
00:03:24,178 --> 00:03:28,316
THERE WAS NEVER MUCH TO CHANGE.

116
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,851
>> THAT IS TRUE.

117
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,288
HE WROTE "THE BOAT DOCTRINE AS

118
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:38,492
WELL IF I COULD MENTION ONE

119
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:41,796
OTHER DIMENSION OF HIS LIFE,

120
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:42,596
CHRIS MENTIONED SUPPORT AND

121
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:43,030
ENCOURAGEMENT.

122
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,701
I WOULD SAY THAT AS A MENTOR, HE

123
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:47,268
WAS QUITE INCREDIBLE.

124
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,503
HE DID NOT WAIT TO COME TO YOU

125
00:03:49,503 --> 00:03:51,339
FOR ADVICE.

126
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:55,676
IN APRIL OF '09, HE INVITED ME

127
00:03:55,676 --> 00:03:56,510
TO HIS OFFICE.

128
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,412
I WENT THERE AND I THOUGHT THAT

129
00:03:58,412 --> 00:04:00,381
I HAD IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

130
00:04:00,381 --> 00:04:04,685
HE SAID HE WAS A RELAPSER

131
00:04:04,685 --> 00:04:06,620
PSYCHIATRIST BUT BOY, COULD HE

132
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,989
WRITE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT YOU

133
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:09,690
WANTED TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE.

134
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,294
AND I REMEMBER SHE WAS ON DUTY

135
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,995
ON THE ANCHOR DESK ON THE

136
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:15,363
SATURDAY.

137
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:17,565
AND THERE WAS A TERRORIST ATTACK

138
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:19,399
IT THERE WAS HARDLY ANYBODY

139
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:19,800
AROUND.

140
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,834
CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER CAME TO THE

141
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,436
STUDIO AND WAS IN THE STUDIO FOR

142
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:23,871
SIX HOURS AS SHE ANCHORED THAT

143
00:04:23,871 --> 00:04:26,607
DAY, HELPING HER THROUGH IT.

144
00:04:26,607 --> 00:04:27,975
HE WAS ALWAYS SO GENEROUS, AND I

145
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,377
HOPE THAT WE CAN REMEMBER THAT

146
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:30,311
ABOUT CHARLES AS WELL.

147
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,013
HE TRIED TO LIVE OUR LIVES AS HE

148
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,982
DID.

149
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:36,484
>> HE REALLY LOVED HIS LIFE.

150
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,186
AND HE EMBRACED IT, AND WAS IN

151
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:40,988
THE MOMENT AND ALL OF THOSE

152
00:04:40,988 --> 00:00:00,000
THINGS THAT EVERYBODY TRIES TO
