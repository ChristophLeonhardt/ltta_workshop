00:00:18,846 --> 00:00:19,980

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,734
I'M NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC

20
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,303

00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:14,134
NORTH KOREA ABOUT THE TERMS

41
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:15,402
OF WHAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED

00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:16,437
AT A SUMMIT.

43
00:01:16,437 --> 00:01:17,771
AND THERE IS GOOD REASON TO

44
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:18,706
BE SKEPTICAL ABOUT NORTH

45
00:01:18,706 --> 00:01:20,274
KOREA BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SO

46
00:01:20,274 --> 00:01:21,642
MANY TIMES MEETING WITH THEM

47
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:23,744

NOW THAT THEY HAVE FINALLY

52
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:31,151
ACHIEVED THEIR LONG-HELD

53
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:34,254
GOAL OF DENUCLEARIZATION,

54
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:35,489
WHAT THEY HOPE TO GET IN

55
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:37,324
EXCHANGE FOR THEIR CLAIM

56
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:40,294
THAT THEY WILL DENUCLEARIZE.

57
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:41,996
>> Mike: WE HEARD SOME

58
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:43,197
BIPARTISAN SKEPTICISM OR

59
00:01:43,197 --> 00:01:44,365
CONCERN FROM LAWMAKERS.

60
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:44,898
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN.

61
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:46,100

ACT LIKE YOU WANT TO

67
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:52,139
NEGOTIATE.

68
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,640
THEN COME UP WITH SOME

69
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,908
OUTLANDISH VIEW OF WHAT THAT

00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:55,743
NEGOTIATION MEANS AND TRY TO

WHAT HAVE YOU AGREED TO DO.

75
00:02:03,717 --> 00:02:05,419
>> TWICE BEFORE NORTH KOREA

76
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:06,854
UNDER KIM JONG UN'S FATHER

77
00:02:06,854 --> 00:02:08,187
COMMITTED TO FULL

78
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:08,989
DENUCLEARIZATION IN SIX

79
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,426
PARTY TALKS IN 2005 AND

80
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:12,726
2007.

81
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:14,294
AS SENATOR BLUNT JUST

82
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,195
REFERENCED ONLY THEN TO

83
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:16,030
CHANGE THEIR TUNE.

84
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,965
>> SO A LOT OF FOLKS FROM

85
00:02:17,965 --> 00:02:19,133
BOTH PARTIES FAVOR TALKING.

86
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,467
THERE IS AT LEAST CAUTION,

87
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:20,901
RIGHT, KAREN?

88
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,036
>> I THINK, TOO.

89
00:02:22,036 --> 00:02:23,504
THIS GO AROUND, AFTER WE SAW

90
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:25,506
THE PRESIDENT SORT OF RUN UP

91
00:02:25,506 --> 00:02:28,208
TO THIS ONCE BEFORE, THE WAY

92
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,777
IT'S GOING ABOUT LOOK AS LOT

93
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:30,644
MORE PROFESSIONAL THAN THE

94
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:31,812
FIRST TIME.

95
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:33,714
THE PRESIDENT IS ACTUALLY

96
00:02:33,714 --> 00:02:35,516
LETTING THE PROS, HIS

97
00:02:35,516 --> 00:02:36,550
FOREIGN POLICY TEAM GET IN

98
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,819
THERE AND KIND OF LAY THE

99
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:39,219
GROUNDWORK.

100
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:43,123
THERE IS A LOT MORE

101
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:43,157
THERE IS A LOT MESE

102
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:43,524
THERE IS A LOT MESSAGED

103
00:02:43,524 --> 00:02:45,192
DISCIPLINE COMING OUT OF

104
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:45,492
THIS.

105
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,895
NO MORE PREMATURE TALK OF

106
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:49,163
NOBEL PRIZES THIS TIME.

107
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:50,030
ONE OTHER THING THAT'S GOING

108
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,098
TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT HERE

109
00:02:51,098 --> 00:02:53,300
IS KIND OF SETTING SOME

110
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,802
REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS.

111
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:55,235
>> Mike: SURE.

112
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:56,470
>> FOR THESE TALKS AS

113
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,805
OPPOSED TO THINKING THAT

114
00:02:57,805 --> 00:02:58,839
SOMEHOW, YOU KNOW, BY THE

115
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:01,175
FORCE OF HIS PERSONALITY,

116
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:02,943
PRESIDENT TRUMP CAN BRING

117
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:04,244
ABOUT FULL DENUCLEARIZATION,

118
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,046
YOU KNOW, IN HIS FIRST

119
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:06,447
MEETING.

120
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:07,548
>> Mike: IS THE MOST LIKELY

121
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:09,383
SCENARIO, TOM, THEY COME OUT

122
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:11,085
OF A MEETING AND SAY WE HAVE

123
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,286
HAD A GOOD DISCUSSION.

124
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,987
WE HAVE MADE SOME STEPS

125
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:14,822
TOWARDS RESOLVING THIS ISSUE

126
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:16,523
AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO

127
00:03:16,523 --> 00:03:17,191
WORKING IT?

128
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:17,991
IS THAT MOST LIKELY.

129
00:03:17,991 --> 00:03:19,860
>> I THINK THAT'S THE IDEAL

130
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,028
SCENARIO FOR THE CHINESE AND

131
00:03:21,028 --> 00:03:23,664
NORTH KOREANS.

132
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:24,264
SCENARIO FOR PRESIDENT

133
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:24,565
TRUMP.

134
00:03:24,565 --> 00:03:26,133
AND SEE THIS HOW THE

135
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:27,067
ADMINISTRATION IS FRAMING IT

136
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,469
AT LEAST GET SOMETHING

137
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:29,336
IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THAT

138
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:29,670
SUMMIT.

139
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,371
WHETHER THAT BE A LIMITED

140
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:36,577
INSPECTIONS TRIP BY THE IAEA

141
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:40,180
OR DECLARATION BALLISTIC

142
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,547
MISSILES.

143
00:03:40,547 --> 00:03:41,548
SOMETHING TANGIBLE.

144
00:03:41,548 --> 00:03:42,816
AND I THINK THE GOOD THING

145
00:03:42,816 --> 00:03:44,985
ABOUT THIS, THAT SKEPTICISM

146
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:45,886
RENDERING THAT AMERICAN

147
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:47,020
EXPECTATION OF SOMETHING

148
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,122
TANGIBLE MEANS THAT IF YOU

149
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:50,057
DON'T GET SOMETHING TANGIBLE

150
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:51,225
THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GO

151
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,227
BACK TO THIS SORT OF MAXIMUM

152
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,027
PRESSURE APPROACH BECAUSE IT

153
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:55,129
WILL BE PRETTY CLEAR THAT

154
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:56,230
THE NORTH KOREANS ARE DOING

155
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,698
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE

156
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:01,168
WHICH IS TO SAY PLAYING

157
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:01,935
>> Mike: SOUTH KOREAN

158
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:02,603
PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE

159
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:03,270
MESSAGE HE WAS DELIVERING

160
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,072
OVER THE WEEKEND TO THE

161
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:05,939
NORTH KOREANS.

162
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:06,673
TAKE A LISTEN TO.

163
00:04:06,673 --> 00:04:07,841
THIS I EXPLAINED TO NORTH

164
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:08,642
KOREAN LEADER KIM JONG UN

165
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:10,177
THE RESULTS OF MY MEETING

166
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:10,878
WITH U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP

167
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:12,246
FROM LAST WEEK AND DELIVERED

168
00:04:12,246 --> 00:04:13,280
THE MESSAGE THAT PRESIDENT

169
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,615
TRUMP HAS A STRONG WILL FOR

170
00:04:14,615 --> 00:04:16,416
PUTTING AN EDGED TO HOSTILE

171
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,185
RELATIONS AND HELP ACHIEVE

172
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:20,353
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY.

173
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:21,387
PROVIDED CHAIRMAN KIM MAKES

174
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,956
A DECISION FOR COMPLETE

175
00:04:22,956 --> 00:04:23,624
DENUCLEARIZATION AND CARRIES

176
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:24,925
IT OUT.

177
00:04:24,925 --> 00:04:25,959
>> Mike: SO THERE WAS A LOT

178
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,161
OF SPECULATION THIS PAST

179
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:28,729
WEEK THAT PRESIDENT MOON WAS

180
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:29,796
COMING HERE AND WOULD BE

181
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:30,898
TAKING A MESSAGE WITH HIM.

182
00:04:30,898 --> 00:04:32,099
NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE HE DID

183
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,367
DELIVER A MESSAGE.

184
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,034
RIGHT, TOM?

185
00:04:34,034 --> 00:04:34,668
>> YES.

186
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:35,602
I THINK THAT'S TRUE.

187
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:38,472
I ALSO THINK THE CHINESE

188
00:04:38,472 --> 00:04:39,673
HERE WERE TRYING TO TEST THE

189
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:40,941
WATERS HERE WITH PRESIDENT

190
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:43,810
TRUMP BY TELLING THE NORTH

191
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,179
KOREANS PLAY GAMES.

192
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:45,879
NOW CONTEXT OF PRESIDENT

193
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,047
TRUMP PLAYING HARD BALL WITH

194
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:48,549
THEM ON TRADE, THEY WANT

195
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:49,783
U.S. CONCESSIONS IN THE

196
00:04:49,783 --> 00:04:51,718
SOUTH CHINA SEA AS PART OF

197
00:04:51,718 --> 00:04:52,753
THEIR QUID PRO QUO FOR

198
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:53,620
PRESSURING PYONGYANG.

199
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,388
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLAYING

200
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:56,223
THAT GAME OF

201
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:56,723
UNPREDICTABILITY.

202
00:04:56,723 --> 00:04:58,258
THIS IS THE ONE ISSUE WHERE

203
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,127
THE TWITTER FEED AND

204
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:02,429
STRANGENESS OF IT ALL SERVES

205
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:03,497
AS A POSITIVE INTEREST

206
00:05:03,497 --> 00:05:05,365
BECAUSE IT THROWS FOREIGN

207
00:05:05,365 --> 00:05:06,533
NATIONS WHO HAVE A DIFFERENT

208
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,568
POLITICAL STRUCTURES TO OUR

209
00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:10,137
OWN OFF BALANCE IN TERMS OF

210
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,538
TRUMP MIGHT DO.

211
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,607
MIKE PIKE WE KNOW AN ADVANCE

212
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,042
TEAM WENT TO NORTH KOREA TO

213
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,577
TALK ABOUT THIS SO IT SOUNDS

214
00:05:16,577 --> 00:05:17,544
LIKE THEY ARE HOPEFUL?

215
00:05:17,544 --> 00:05:18,812
>> AGAIN, THEY ARE SENDING

216
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:20,480
THE PROS IN TO LAY THE

217
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:20,881
GROUNDWORK.

218
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:21,715
I THINK PRESIDENT MOON HAS

219
00:05:21,715 --> 00:05:23,283
BEEN IN A LOT OF WAYS THE

220
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:24,384
MOST INTERESTING PERSON TO

221
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:25,886
WATCH IN ALL OF THIS.

222
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:28,989
HE DOES SEEM TO BE KIND OF

223
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:32,092
UTMOST SKILLFUL AT KIND OF

224
00:05:32,092 --> 00:05:33,026
READING ALL THE INTERESTS

225
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:35,395
AND SORT OF BRINGING

226
00:05:35,395 --> 00:05:38,632
EVERYBODY ALONG.

227
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:39,299
>> Mike: MOLLIE, HOW DO YOU

228
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:40,400
THINK THE NEXT COUPLE OF

229
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,235
WEEKS PLAY OUT WITH THIS.

230
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:42,803
>> IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT

231
00:05:42,803 --> 00:05:44,171
THAT IT WASN'T THAT THE U.S.

232
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:45,672
WAS NOT EAGER TO MEET OR

233
00:05:45,672 --> 00:05:47,107
THAT THE U.S. WASN'T TRYING

234
00:05:47,107 --> 00:05:48,709
TO MAKE TERMS FOR WHAT THE

235
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:49,876
SUMMIT WOULD BE BUT THAT

236
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:51,044
NORTH KOREA WASN'T SHOWING

237
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:51,311
UP.

238
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,412
>> ALSO THE PRESIDENT SORT

239
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:53,914
OF GETTING OUT OF HIS OWN

240
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:54,615
FOREIGN POLICY TEAM.

241
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:56,049
IN FACT, BY ANNOUNCING THIS

242
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,784
MEETING BEFORE HE EVEN

243
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,419
DISCUSSED WITH HIS OWN

244
00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:00,954
FOREIGN POLICY TEAM WHAT HE

245
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,022
WAS GOING TO DO.

246
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:03,857
THAT REALLY DID KIND OF

247
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:05,025
LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF

248
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,760
GROUNDWORK THAT COULD BE

249
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,060
DONE.

250
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,195
>> WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S

251
00:06:08,195 --> 00:06:09,630
LIMITING OR THAT KIND OF

252
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,998
PRESSURE IS ACTUALLY

253
00:06:10,998 --> 00:06:11,331
HELPFUL.

254
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:12,132
YOU ARE SEEING WITH SOUTH

255
00:06:12,132 --> 00:06:13,533
KOREA PUTTING PRESSURE ON

256
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:13,867
PEOPLE.

257
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:17,170
THEY ARE VERY

258
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:17,204
THEY ARE EERY

259
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:17,237
THEY ARE EAGY

260
00:06:17,237 --> 00:06:18,272
THEY ARE EAGER TO MOVE

261
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:18,872
THINGS FORWARD.

262
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:20,340
IN A LETTER LAST WEEK HE

263
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,475
SAID SOMETHING ABOUT WE WERE

264
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:22,376
TOLD BY SOUTH KOREA YOU

265
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:23,043
WANTED TO MEET.

266
00:06:23,043 --> 00:06:24,077
WE WERE TOLD BY SOUTH KOREA

267
00:06:24,077 --> 00:06:25,045
THAT NORTH KOREA WANTED TO

268
00:06:25,045 --> 00:06:25,345
MEET.

269
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:26,647
KIND OF SUGGESTED THAT MAYBE

270
00:06:26,647 --> 00:06:28,115
THEY WEREN'T CONFIDENT IN

271
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:29,383
WHAT SOUTH KOREA WAS SAYING.

272
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:31,051
THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH THAT

273
00:06:31,051 --> 00:06:31,985
HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED

274
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:32,686
THROUGH SOUTH KOREA.

275
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:35,856
AND EVEN TODAY THEY ARE

276
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,624
SHOWING SUCH EAGERNESS.

277
00:06:37,624 --> 00:06:38,959
INTEREST IN GETTING MEETING

278
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:39,259
GOING.

279
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:40,861
TRUMP TALKED WITH ABE TODAY.

280
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,229
JAPAN IS VERY INTERESTED IN

281
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:43,430
GETTING THINGS GOING.

282
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,631
CHINA, I THINK, IS THE

283
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:45,932
INTERESTING PARTY HERE.

284
00:06:45,932 --> 00:00:00,000
WE WILL NOT GET A DEAL
