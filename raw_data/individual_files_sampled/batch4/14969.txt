one of Canada's biggest attention seekers Sarah Thompson well she's at it again this time she sent out a vile venomous tweet attacking Doug Ford and his late brother Rob yet how is it that Twitter doesn't have any problem with Thomson's horrific remarks but Twitter does take exception to those who criticize this ghoul just wait'll you hear the details folks I'm no psychiatrist but one must ponder the question is Sarah Thompson mentally unstable oh we have no way of knowing for sure of course yet judging by her public pronouncements you gotta wonder as chronicled in this space a few months ago this failed politician accused TVO journalist Steve Paikin of sexual harassment now without rehashing all those lurid details for those in the know and regardless of where one sits on the political spectrum bacon is likely the last journalist in Canada one would ever accuse of doing something so odious and Thompson's credibility is such that Bacon's employer didn't even suspend him for that do rigueur investigation indeed it wouldn't surprise me if Thomson gets sued for defamation for that whopper so after going down in flames with the Paikin nonsense where does the sensational Sarah go from here oh well she's turning her sights on provincial politics now and just check out this egregious tweet quote is it me or is Doug Ford's team is trying to make him look and act exactly like his brother watch he'll gain 30 pounds and use words like folks and y'all I'm surprised he hasn't shaved his head for cancer to get the sympathy vote end quote well Thompson starts off with a form of fat shaming and then hits a perverse crescendo by wondering if Doug Ford will fake can sir to elicit sympathy as if he even needs such an assist in terms of his impending victory come June secondly what sort of a degenerate would mock someone's dearly departed brother for cheap political points and in the Department of those who live in glass houses Thompson has the audacity to speculate on someone's head of air I mean check out this mug shot gee given those dreadlocks where the hell is the cultural appropriation police oh and by that folks I don't mean in regard to offended Jamaicans I mean those who are developed fans of the predator movies yeah separated at Birth right in truth Thompson's disgusting thought process isn't really worthy of comment in fact it turns out you know just might be prohibited from commenting on her due to these social justice censors residing at Twitter case in point someone who is quite dear to me had this to say on Twitter regarding the Thompson tweet quote it amazes me that you sat at your keyboard type that vile and disgusting tweet read it back to yourself and hit the tweet button the only thing you are sorry for is that you have been admonished and humiliated for it you should hang your head in shame you are a horrible person end quote and guess what happened folks Twitter promptly suspended this person's account why well Twitter says she quote violated our rules against promoting or encouraging suicide or self-harm end quote what the hell at first I was gobsmacked in trying to make sense of this when I reread the tweet and then reread it again and then I had an epiphany the gatekeepers at Twitter apparently believe that the well-worn phrase hang your head in shame is actually encouraged meant for someone to pursue hanging as in dangling from a noose did a human at Twitter flag this phrase or was it an automated process I mean I know we live in an era of artificial intelligence but this qualifies as a new form of AI artificial idiocy moral of the story Sarah here's six figures worth of free political advice for you please subscribe to the old Mark Twain quote namely it is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all doubt and secondly in light of Twitter's either natural or manufactured censorship stupidity for the love of God if there is a right-leaning billionaire out there who truly believes in freedom of speech and is thinking about investing in a social media platform huh there's no time like the present for the rebel dog media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the rebel has a brand new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
