53
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:38,902
WAS ANNOUNCED BECAUSE THEY KNOW

54
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:42,005

64
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:58,088
TO TAKE A LOT LONGER WITH THE

65
00:01:58,088 --> 00:01:59,490

67
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:02,092

68
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:04,395
WANT MORE TIME.

THE IMPORTANT PROCESS THAT THE

75
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:19,710
MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING

76
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,111
TO KNOW A BAND.

77
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:21,812
THIS IS DANGEROUS.

78
00:02:21,812 --> 00:02:24,215
HE TOOK IT ON, TAKE A LOOK.

00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:28,519
THIS IS ANOTHER SEVENTH

81
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:29,086

00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:29,887
IT IS NOT THEY ARE JUST

83
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:30,254
STARTING.

84
00:02:30,254 --> 00:02:33,023

85
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,860
COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION.

86
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,663
WHATEVER THAT MEANS ACCORDING TO

87
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:42,900
THE SENATORS AND THE REPUBLICANS

88
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,901
ON THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.

89
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,503
I WANT THEM TO DO THAT.

90
00:02:45,503 --> 00:02:47,304
THE REASON I WOULD LIKE THEM TO

91
00:02:47,304 --> 00:02:49,507
GO QUICKLY, TO SO SIMPLE.

92
00:02:49,507 --> 00:02:52,810
BECAUSE IT IS UNFAIR TO HIM AT

93
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,210
THIS POINT.

94
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,614
WHAT HIS WIFE IS GOING THROUGH,

95
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:58,816
WHAT HIS BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN ARE

96
00:02:58,816 --> 00:03:00,384
GOING THROUGH IS NOT

97
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:00,785
DESCRIBABLE.

98
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:02,320
IT IS NOT DESCRIBABLE.

99
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,789
IT IS NOT FAIR.

WAS ONCE AGAIN DELAYED LAST WEEK

102
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:11,495

00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:12,797
COERCED A FLAKY REPUBLICAN, TO

SAT DOWN WITH ONE OF HIS

110
00:03:24,008 --> 00:03:24,975
DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES ON

111
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,143
"60 MINUTES" TO PAT HIMSELF ON

112
00:03:26,143 --> 00:03:31,115
THE BACK FOR HIS HEROIC MOMENTS.

113
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:32,850
HE DID ADMIT IN THE INTERVIEW

114
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,719
THAT HE WAS SEEKING REELECTION,

115
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:35,653
HE WOULD NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE

116
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:37,121
THIS.

117
00:03:37,121 --> 00:03:37,922
EVER.

118
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,323
HE CAME TO THE DEMOCRATIC

119
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:40,825
DEMANDS, HE IS NO OTHER HERO.

120
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,326
TAKE A LOOK.

121
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:44,328
>> YOU HAVE ANNOUNCE THAT YOU

122
00:03:44,328 --> 00:03:46,330
ARE NOT RUNNING FOR REELECTION,

123
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,132
COULD HE HAVE DONE THIS?

124
00:03:48,132 --> 00:03:50,701
>> NO.

125
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:51,035
[LAUGHS]

126
00:03:51,035 --> 00:03:51,902
NOT A CHANCE.

127
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:54,538
>> NOT A CHANCE.

128
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,907
>> BECAUSE POLITICS HAVE BECOME

129
00:03:56,907 --> 00:03:58,442
TOO SHARP, TOO PARTISAN?

130
00:03:58,442 --> 00:04:00,478
>> THERE IS NO VALUE TO REACHING

131
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,446
ACROSS THE AISLE, THERE IS NO

132
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:06,517

00:04:09,353 --> 00:04:10,788
BLASEY FORD, THESE ARE ALL

136
00:04:10,788 --> 00:04:11,956
IMPORTANT FACTS YOU HAVE TO

137
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:12,723
REMEMBER.

138
00:04:12,723 --> 00:04:14,492
IT IS WELL UNDERWAY.

139
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:16,527
RACHEL MITCHELL, TO REMEMBER

140
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:17,728
HER?

141
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:19,363
THE QUESTION BOTH PROFESSOR FORD

142
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:21,232
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH, SHE HAS

143
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:21,966
ALREADY RELEASED HER REPORT TO

144
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:24,735
THE SENATE COMMITTEE AND THESE

145
00:04:24,735 --> 00:04:25,102
FINDINGS.

146
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:25,670
THEY ARE DEVASTATED.

147
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,040
THIS IS WHAT SHE SAID, A HE

148
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,740
SAID, SHE SAID CASE IS

149
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,741
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO PROVE

150
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,643
BUT THIS CASE IS EVEN WEAKER

151
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:33,945
THAN THAT.

152
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:35,513
DR. FORD IDENTIFIED OTHER

153
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:37,281
WITNESSES TO THE EVENT AT THOSE

154
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:40,084
WITNESSES EITHER REFUTED HER

155
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:40,852
ALLEGATIONS WERE FAILED TO

156
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:41,519
COOPERATE THEM.

157
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,688
FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED BELOW

158
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:45,123
I DO NOT THINK ANY REASONABLE

159
00:04:45,123 --> 00:04:46,691
PROSECUTOR WOULD BRING THIS CASE

160
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:49,294
BASED ON THE EVIDENCE BEFORE THE

161
00:04:49,294 --> 00:04:49,661
COMMITTEE.

162
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:51,296
THE PROSECUTOR WENT ON TO LIST

163
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:55,099
MULTIPLE ISSUES WERE PROFESSOR

164
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:56,301
FORD'S ALLEGATIONS INCLUDING NO

165
00:04:56,301 --> 00:04:58,703
CONSISTENT ACCOUNT AND WHEN THE

166
00:04:58,703 --> 00:04:59,704
ALLEGED ASSAULT ACTUALLY

167
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:00,638
HAPPENED, A FAILURE TO PROGRESS

168
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:03,975
IDENTIFY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AS HE

169
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:07,245
IS SALIENT.

170
00:05:07,245 --> 00:05:10,081
A FAILURE TO MEMBER KEY DETAILS

171
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,082
INCLUDING WHO REMEMBERED HIM TO

172
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:12,283
THE PARTY, HOW SHE GOT TO THE

173
00:05:12,283 --> 00:05:13,885
PARTY AND WHERE THE PARTY EVEN

174
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:14,285
TOOK PLACE.

175
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:17,088
HOW SHE GOT HOME FROM THE PARTY.

176
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,323
SHE DOES HOWEVER REMEMBER

177
00:05:18,323 --> 00:05:20,291
UNRELATED DETAILS LIKE THE

178
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,025
CONSUMPTION OF EXACTLY ONE BEER

179
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,894
AND THAT SHE TOOK NO MEDICATION

180
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:24,696
THAT DAY.

181
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:26,131
ANOTHER ISSUE LISTED BY

182
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:27,532
PROSECUTORS, IT SURROUNDS THE

183
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:28,900
FACT THAT HER ALLEGATIONS HAVE

184
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,071
BEEN COOPERATED BY NOBODY.

185
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:34,272
INCLUDING A LIFELONG FRIEND.

186
00:05:34,272 --> 00:05:36,274
DR. FORD ALSO STRUGGLED TO

187
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:39,978
RECALL RECENT EVENTS RELATED TO

188
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:41,880
HER ALLEGATIONS INCLUDING THE

189
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,415

INCLUDING HER FEAR OF FLYING AND

193
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:50,488
THE FACT THAT SHE FLIES

194
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:52,657
FREQUENTLY IN MANY OF HER

195
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:53,792
HOBBIES INCLUDE FLYING ALL OVER

196
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:57,295
THE WORLD.

ATTORNEYS LIKELY AFFECTED HER

200
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,734
ACCOUNT.

201
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:05,103
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

202
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,471
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, THIS IS WHERE

203
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,107
WE GET INTO FACTS MATTER.

204
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:10,909
COOPERATION MATTERS, SHE

205
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:12,110
MENTIONED THESE FOUR PEOPLE.

206
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,579
NONE OF THEM COOPERATED HER

207
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:16,115
STORY INCLUDING AN ALLEGED

208
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,250
EYEWITNESS TO THE INCIDENT.

209
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,718
DIANNE FEINSTEIN PLAYED POLITICS

210
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:21,120
WITH PROFESSOR FORD'S VERY

211
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,721
SERIOUS CLAIMS FROM THE VERY

212
00:06:22,721 --> 00:06:23,088
BEGINNING.

213
00:06:23,088 --> 00:06:26,291
SHE KNEW ABOUT THIS IN JULY.

214
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:27,726
LAST WEEK SENATE DEMOCRATS

215
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:28,894
DEMANDING AN FBI INVESTIGATION,

216
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:30,329
FEINSTEIN AND HER COLLEAGUES

217
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:31,063
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS AS I SAID

218
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:34,133
SINCE JULY.

219
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:34,800
THIS CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION

220
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,902
INTO KEITH ELLISON?

221
00:06:36,902 --> 00:06:39,471
FOR THAT MATTER, ONE AT

222
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:40,105
BILL CLINTON?

223
00:06:40,105 --> 00:06:40,873
WHY DIDN'T SENATOR FEINSTEIN ASK

224
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:43,575
BRETT KAVANAUGH WHEN THEY MET

225
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:44,510
PERSONALLY?

226
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,111
WHY AT THE VERY SAME TIME THAT

227
00:06:46,111 --> 00:06:48,280
SHE IS ADVISING PROFESSOR FORD

228
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,882
ON WHAT ATTORNEY TO HIRE,

229
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:52,618
INSTEAD OF CONTACTING HER WITH A

230
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:53,652
QUALIFIED AND EXPERIENCED

231
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:56,622
NONPARTISAN LAWYER?

232
00:06:56,622 --> 00:06:57,623
FEINSTEIN SUGGESTED A PARTISAN

233
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:58,390
LEFT WINGER.

234
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:01,326
BIG-TIME DEMOCRATIC DONOR.

235
00:07:01,326 --> 00:07:04,196
ONCE BE CLAIMED ON NATIONAL TV,

236
00:07:04,196 --> 00:07:05,297
SHE WOULD RESIST

237
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:05,764
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

238
00:07:05,764 --> 00:07:08,467
SHE DISMISSED PAULA JONES.

239
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:11,103
IT WAS ONLY TEN, TO 12 MINUTES.

240
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,706
EXCUSE ME, HE EXPOSED HIMSELF.

241
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:14,473
BILL CLINTON AT THE TIME COMES

242
00:07:14,473 --> 00:07:16,408
THAT WAS THE ALLEGATION.

243
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:18,878
SHE DEFENDED AL FRANKEN.

244
00:07:18,878 --> 00:07:21,714
ACCORDING TO A REPORT FROM THE

245
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:22,882
WASHINGTON BEACON, ONE OF HER

246
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:24,850
CLOSE FRIENDS IS NOW SEARCHING

247
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,618
FOR ANYONE WILLING TO COME

248
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:28,487
FORWARD AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH.

249
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:31,323
THEY ARE SENDING OUT EMAILS TO

250
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:31,657
PEOPLE.

251
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:32,424
LITERALLY SOLICITING PEOPLE AS

252
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:35,461
LATE AS LAST WEEK.

253
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:36,228
FEINSTEIN CARED ABOUT GETTING TO

254
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:40,800
THE TRUTH, WHY A DEMOCRATIC HACK

255
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,868
EVENTS CONSIST ON WHAT IS A

256
00:07:42,868 --> 00:07:44,103
SERIOUS ISSUE?

257
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,104
MEANWHILE EVEN THOUGH PROFESSOR

258
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:47,306
FORD REQUESTED HER NAME REMAIN

259
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:48,407
PRIVATE, IT WAS LEAKED.

260
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:50,109
THE CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS ARE

261
00:07:50,109 --> 00:07:51,710
THE ONLY OFFICIALS WITH ACCESS

262
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,312
TO HER STORY AND SENATE

263
00:07:53,312 --> 00:07:56,382
REPUBLICANS ARE NOW BOWING

264
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:57,116
RIGHTLY SO TO INVESTIGATE DIANNE

265
00:07:57,116 --> 00:07:58,083
FEINSTEIN THE DEMOCRATIC

266
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:01,086
HANDLING OF THIS CASE.

267
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:01,687
SHE IS DENYING ANY

268
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:03,923
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LEAK BUT

269
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:04,757
EARLIER TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP

270
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:06,926
CALLED OUT THE SENATOR FOR HER

271
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:07,693
SHAMELESS POLITICAL PRACTICE AND

272
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:08,227
THEY WERE SHAMELESS.

273
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:11,097
TAKE A LOOK.

274
00:08:11,097 --> 00:08:13,299
>> DIANNE FEINSTEIN KNEW ABOUT

275
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:13,933
THIS TWO MONTHS EARLIER.

276
00:08:13,933 --> 00:08:17,103
IF SHE WANTED A REALLY THOROUGH

277
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:17,803
INVESTIGATION, WE HAD ALL THE

278
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:19,906
TIME IN THE WORLD.

279
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,707
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT TILL

280
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:24,076
AFTER THE HEARING WAS CLOSED.

281
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:24,477
ESSENTIALLY.

282
00:08:24,477 --> 00:08:26,812
SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID LISTEN, I

283
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:28,915
HAVE A PROBLEM.

284
00:08:28,915 --> 00:08:30,283
I HAVE THIS REPORT.

285
00:08:30,283 --> 00:08:32,083
I WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO LOOK AT

286
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:33,486
IT WHILE WE ARE DOING THE

287
00:08:33,486 --> 00:08:33,818
HEARING.

288
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:35,354
WE HAD TWO MONTHS.

289
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:40,126
FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO BE TALKING

290
00:08:40,126 --> 00:08:41,894
ABOUT, WE WANT MORE TIME FOR THE

291
00:08:41,894 --> 00:08:43,996
FBI, IF YOU WANTED MORE TIME

292
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:46,699
WITH THE FBI, WHY DIDN'T DIANE

293
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:48,067
FEINSTEIN BRING THIS UP?

294
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,769
>> Hannity: WHY DIDN'T SHE?

295
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,938
AMERICA DESERVES AN ANSWER TO

296
00:08:51,938 --> 00:08:52,505
THAT QUESTION.

297
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:54,507
WHY DID SHE TELL HER REPUBLICAN

298
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:55,541
COLLEAGUE, WE NEED TIME, WE

299
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:56,709
CAN'T RUSH THIS.

300
00:08:56,709 --> 00:08:59,312
WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME DEMOCRATS

301
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:00,446
HAVE CONTINUED THEIR POLITICAL

302
00:09:00,446 --> 00:09:01,447
STALL TACTICS.

303
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:03,516
LAST WEEK IT WAS A NARROW

304
00:09:03,516 --> 00:09:05,518
INVESTIGATION, LIMITED TO ONLY A

305
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:06,519
WEEK AND I DESPITE

306
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,420
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ORDERING THE

307
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,022
FBI TO INVESTIGATE ANY AND ALL

308
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,123
LEGITIMATE CLAIMS, IT IS STILL

309
00:09:10,123 --> 00:09:11,991
NOT ENOUGH FOR THE LEFT.

310
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:15,094
THEY WANT FBI INVESTIGATIONS AND

311
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,796
EVERY SINGLE CLAIM MADE AGAINST

312
00:09:16,796 --> 00:09:17,864
BRETT KAVANAUGH NO MATTER HOW

313
00:09:17,864 --> 00:09:18,898
UNSUBSTANTIATED AND SOME ARE

314
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:19,999
EVEN CALLING FOR AN

315
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:20,700
INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER OR

316
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,902
NOT HE LIED ABOUT HOW MUCH YOU

317
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:24,304
DRINK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

318
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:26,205
HE SAID SOMETIMES HE DRANK A

319
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:26,472
LOT.

320
00:09:26,472 --> 00:09:27,507
LIKE A LOT OF KIDS IN

321
00:09:27,507 --> 00:09:28,675
HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.

322
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:31,077
THAT IS CALLED MOVING THE GOAL

323
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:33,579
POST, THAT IS CALLED MOVING THE

324
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:34,113
GAME.

325
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:35,515
THEY WANT TO STALL THE

326
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,683
NOMINATION, THEY WANT THE

327
00:09:36,683 --> 00:09:38,485
MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THESE FACTS

328
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:39,686
ALL MATTER.

329
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,388
36 DAYS, YOU, WE COME WITH THE

330
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:43,290
PEOPLE, DO YOU WANT TO PUT THESE

331
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,224
PEOPLE IN POWER?

332
00:09:44,224 --> 00:09:46,059
THEY WERE TO IMPEACH THE

333
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:47,294
PRESIDENT, THEY WANT THEIR

334
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,895
CRIMES BACK AND THEY WANT TO

335
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:50,263
OPEN THE BORDERS AND THEY WANT

336
00:09:50,263 --> 00:09:52,265
TO KEEP OBAMACARE.

337
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:53,867
IF THE FBI DOES EXTEND THE

338
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,669
INVESTIGATION INTO THE SECOND

339
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:56,636
ACCUSER THAN THE THIRD ACCUSER

340
00:09:56,636 --> 00:09:58,505
WE ARTY KNOW ABOUT THE SECOND

341
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:00,373
ACCUSER WE FIND AGAIN, ON SUCH

342
00:10:00,373 --> 00:10:01,908
EDUCATED CLAIMS FROM A WOMAN WHO

343
00:10:01,908 --> 00:10:03,977
CLAIMS THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH MAY

344
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:04,778
HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO

345
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,113
HER IN A DRUNKEN COLLEGE PARTY

346
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:09,916
WHEN HE WAS A FRESHMAN.

347
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:10,684
SHE DOESN'T REALLY REMEMBER IN

348
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:12,752
FACTORIES THAT SHE WASN'T FULLY

349
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:14,654
SURE IF HE WAS THE PERPETRATOR.

350
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:16,089
SHE CALLED AROUND ACCORDING TO

351
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,257
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" TO SEE IF

352
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:18,091
THEY REMEMBERED THE INCIDENT

353
00:10:18,091 --> 00:10:19,693
WHETHER IT WAS HIM.

354
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:20,894
THEY DID NOT.

355
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:22,462
SHE EVEN ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SHE

356
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:24,831
HAS SIGNIFICANT MEMORY GAPS FROM

357
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:25,599
THAT EVENING.

358
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:31,405
"NEW YORK TIMES" REFUSES TO

359
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,707
WRITE THE STORY.

360
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:36,209
IN THIS CASE THE FBI IS LIKELY

361
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:37,144
TO FIND A LOT OF INCONSISTENCIES

362
00:10:37,144 --> 00:10:39,079
FROM HER WHILE DELEGATIONS PAID

363
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:40,180
REMEMBER, SHE IS CLAIMING THAT

364
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,949
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS INVOLVED IN

365
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:47,054
A SERIAL DRUGGING AND GANG RAPE

366
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:47,921
THAT HAPPENED ALMOST EVERY

367
00:10:47,921 --> 00:10:48,488
WEEKEND IN THE 80s.

368
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:51,258
SHE WENT TO TEN OF THESE

369
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:53,293
PARTIES, TODAY SHE IS

370
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:54,494
REPRESENTED BY THE ALL FAME

371
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:55,762
SEEKING ATTORNEY MICHAEL NAVA

372
00:10:55,762 --> 00:10:57,831
LOTTIE, THE NEW FACE PARTY SAT

373
00:10:57,831 --> 00:10:59,866
DOWN WITH NBC NEWS.

374
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,602
BY THE END OF THE DAY IT WILL BE

375
00:11:01,602 --> 00:11:02,002
A DISASTER.

376
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,870
TAKE A LOOK.

377
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,273
>> IN THAT STATEMENT SHE SAID

378
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:08,442
SHE BECAME AWARE OF EFFORTS BY

379
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:10,310
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS FRIEND

380
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,045
TO SPIKED PUNCH AT PARTIES.

381
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,914
IN HER INTERVIEW SHE SAID SHE

382
00:11:13,914 --> 00:11:15,983
SAW THEM NEAR THE PUNCH BUT DID

383
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:16,951
NOT SPECIFICALLY SHE SAW EITHER

384
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,686
MAN TO SPIKE IT.

385
00:11:18,686 --> 00:11:21,188
DID YOU SEE BRETT KAVANAUGH

386
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:24,692
SPIKING THE PUNCH?

387
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:27,461
>> I SAW HIM GIVING RED SOLO

388
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,495
CUPS TO QUITE A FEW GIRLS' NIGHT

389
00:11:28,495 --> 00:11:29,096
TIME.

390
00:11:29,096 --> 00:11:32,867
I SAW HIM AROUND THE PUNCH.

391
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:33,300
THE CONTAINER.

392
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,069
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID.

393
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,070
I SAW HIM BUY THEM.

394
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,505
>> ARE THEIR FRIENDS WHO MEMBER

395
00:11:38,505 --> 00:11:39,273
THESE PARTIES TO?

396
00:11:39,273 --> 00:11:40,674
>> I THINK EVERYONE IN

397
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:42,476
THE COUNTY OF THESE PARTIES.

398
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,812
>> WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM THOSE

399
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:45,145
FRIENDS.

400
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,448
I AM ASKING, ARE THE PEOPLE

401
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,884
ALIVE TODAY?

402
00:11:49,884 --> 00:11:52,453
>> YES, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

403
00:11:52,453 --> 00:11:53,487
KNOW ABOUT THOSE PARTIES.

404
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,623
>> THIS MORNING SHE PROVIDED

405
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:56,357
FOUR NAMES OF FRIENDS WHO WENT

406
00:11:56,357 --> 00:11:57,725
TO THOSE PARTIES WITH HER, ONE

407
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,860
OF THEM SAYS SHE DOES NOT RECALL

408
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,164
THAT.

409
00:12:04,164 --> 00:12:04,965
ANOTHER FRIEND IS DECEASED.

410
00:12:04,965 --> 00:12:05,666
WE HAVE REACH OUT TO THE OTHER

411
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,835
TWO AND HAVEN'T HEARD BACK.

412
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:10,037
>> Hannity: STILL COME AS YOUR

413
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,472
COOPERATION, THE SAME NBC NEWS

414
00:12:11,472 --> 00:12:14,074
THAT SET ON THAT INTERVIEW WHEN

415
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:15,843
SHE WAS MAKING ALLEGATIONS ABOUT

416
00:12:15,843 --> 00:12:16,277
BILL CLINTON.

417
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,679
THEY REFUSED TO AIR THAT FOR

418
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:20,247
OVER A MONTH ALL BECAUSE THEY

419
00:12:20,247 --> 00:12:21,715
SAID IT COULDN'T BE COOPERATED.

420
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:25,653
THEY NEEDED TIME TO VENT IT.

421
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,088
NBC, THIS IS A DISGRACE.

422
00:12:27,088 --> 00:12:28,255
THIS IS NOT NEWS.

423
00:12:28,255 --> 00:12:30,257
THIS IS THEM LETTING AN

424
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:31,258
INDIVIDUAL MAKE ON COOPERATED

425
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,694
CLAIMS AND THEN JUST AIRING IT.

426
00:12:33,694 --> 00:12:36,797
HERE THEY ARE RUNNING TOTALLY

427
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:40,234
UNVERIFIED CLAIMS AGAINST JUDGE

428
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:42,503
KAVANAUGH AND MULTIPLE

429
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,137
INCONSISTENCIES YET AGAIN.

430
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,907
ARE THERE ANY NEWS STANDARDS

431
00:12:45,907 --> 00:12:46,641
OVER THERE?

432
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,309
SHOULD WE ALL BE SURPRISED?

433
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,078
THIS IS NOW A DISASTER FOR

434
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:50,645
NBC NEWS.

435
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,681
BY THE WAY, TOM BROKAW IF YOU'RE

436
00:12:53,681 --> 00:12:54,415
WATCHING AND IF SOMEBODY CALLS

437
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:56,384
YOU IN 3 MINUTES, WILL YOU ERR

438
00:12:56,384 --> 00:12:57,251
THIS?

439
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,653
YOU NEED TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY.

440
00:12:58,653 --> 00:12:59,587
HE SPENT HER WHOLE LEG TRYING TO

441
00:12:59,587 --> 00:13:01,623
BUILD THAT BRAND.

442
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:04,125
ALL THREE OF THESE STORIES, THEY

443
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:08,296
HAVE ONE THING IN COMMON, ZERO

444
00:13:08,296 --> 00:13:09,864
COOPERATING EVIDENCE.

445
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:12,233
OUTRIGHT DENIALS OF SO-CALLED

446
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:12,867
WITNESSES AND MANY

447
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:13,334
INCONSISTENCIES.

448
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,270
AFTER ALL, THIS IS HOW YOUR

449
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,472
MAINSTREAM MEDIA IS NOW TREATING

450
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:18,706
THE ONGOING SUPREME COURT

451
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:19,274
BATTLE.

452
00:13:19,274 --> 00:13:22,277
THIS WEEK AND A CARTOONIST DREW

453
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:24,445
THIS FILE DEPICTION OF JUDGE

454
00:13:24,445 --> 00:13:25,113
KAVANAUGH'S YOUNG DAUGHTER,

455
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:29,150
PRAYING FOR HER ANGRY, LYING,

456
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,885
ALCOHOLIC FATHER FOR ASSAULTING

457
00:13:30,885 --> 00:13:31,719
DR. FORD.

458
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,454
AND NEVER MADE INTO A NEWSPAPER.

459
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:34,455
THERE CARTOONIST PUBLISH IT

460
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:36,658
ONLINE ON HIS OWN.

461
00:13:36,658 --> 00:13:40,295
HE DIDN'T RETURN OUR REQUEST FOR

462
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:40,862
COMMENTING, SHOCKING.

463
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,897
JAMES COMEY, HE OF COURSE IS

464
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:45,466
CALLING FOR AN UNLIMITED TIME

465
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:47,635
FRAME FOR FBI INVESTIGATIONS AND

466
00:13:47,635 --> 00:13:48,369
BASHING ANYBODY, HE WON'T SIT

467
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,339
DOWN WITH INVESTIGATORS "MOST

468
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:52,507
PEOPLE WILL SPEAK TO THE FBI

469
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:54,876
REFUSAL TO DO SO IS ITS OWN KIND

470
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,477
OF STATEMENT."

471
00:13:56,477 --> 00:13:58,813
I AM THINKING, REALLY?

472
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:01,649
ASK A GENERAL FLINT ABOUT

473
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:05,053
SPEAKING TO THE FBI.

474
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,055
THAT WORKED OUT PERFECT FOR

475
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,056
THEM.

476
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,558
IN THE CASE OF EVEN GENERAL

477
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,426
FLINT, THEY DIDN'T THINK HE

478
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:11,726
LIED.

479
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,195
HE WAS CHARGED WITH LYING.

480
00:14:13,195 --> 00:14:17,832
WHEN YOU SEE ALL OF THESE BRETT

481
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:19,100
KAVANAUGH OFF BEDS COME ASKING

482
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,835
FOR MORE INFORMATION AND USE THE

483
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:22,637
MEDIA RUSHING TO JUDGMENT.

484
00:14:22,637 --> 00:14:24,406
WHEN YOU SEE DEMOCRATS DEMANDING

485
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,874
MORE AND MORE INVESTIGATION, YOU

486
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:28,677
HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS ONE CLEAR

487
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:30,245
POINT AND THIS IS WHAT MATTERS

488
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,581
TONIGHT, THIS IS ALL ABOUT

489
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:32,948
POLITICS.

490
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:34,449
IT IS NOT ABOUT POWER.

491
00:14:34,449 --> 00:14:37,052
IT IS NOT ABOUT THE TRUTH.

492
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:37,886
DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN AGAINST

493
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:38,854
BRETT KAVANAUGH PUBLICLY FROM

494
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:42,190
THEY DID THAT HE WAS ANNOUNCED.

495
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,858
NO MATTER WHAT THIS

496
00:14:42,858 --> 00:14:43,758
INVESTIGATION FINDS, THEY WILL

497
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,493
NEVER VOTE FOR THEM ANYWAY.

498
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:46,928
THEY NEVER WERE.

499
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,864
IT IS LIKELY EVERY SINGLE REPORT

500
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,265
AND EVENT IN MODERN HISTORY.

501
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:53,268
THIS IS A MATTER THAT WE BETTER

502
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,236
GET RIGHT.

503
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:55,637
IF YOU DON'T HAVE EVIDENCE AND

504
00:14:55,637 --> 00:14:57,806
YOU ARE GOING TO RUSH TO

505
00:14:57,806 --> 00:15:00,242
JUDGMENT AND YOU WILL HAVE ZERO

506
00:15:00,242 --> 00:15:01,710
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE, BY THE

507
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,247
WAY THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME.

508
00:15:05,247 --> 00:15:07,249
FERGUSON, MISSOURI, RICHARD

509
00:15:07,249 --> 00:15:09,051
JEWELL, THE BALTIMORE, MARYLAND,

LACROSSE, NOW JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

512
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:15,090
CLARENCE THOMAS.

513
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,659
WE HAVE A PARTY OF SMEARS,

514
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,461
SLANDER, LIES AND NO DUE

515
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,262
PROCESS.

516
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:20,529
NON!

517
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:23,131
THEY SHOULD BE POLITICAL.

518
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,700
ALL THE LEFT-WING FRIENDS IN THE

519
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,968
MAINSTREAM MEDIA, THE DEEP STATE

520
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,070
ARE BACKING THEM UP.

521
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,039
THERE IS NO LIGHT THEY'RE NOT

522
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,207
WILLING TO DESTROY FOR POWER.

523
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:34,576
NO REPUTATION.

524
00:15:34,576 --> 00:15:38,046
THERE IS NO PROCESS.

525
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,648
NO ISSUE THEY WANT TO

526
00:15:39,648 --> 00:00:00,000
POLITICIZE.
