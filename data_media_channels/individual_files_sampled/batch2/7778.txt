the DNC is having problems raising money I think may was maybe they're worse fundraising month since 2003 no one wants to give money to the DNC we're gonna talk about that why I think this might be a big reason why here's Nancy Pelosi and she's talking about their central message and she can't remember what it is just to read it off a pamphlet they think I'm kidding here we go Emily's economically that takes us to the better deal and the better deal I just want to just say this to you because you'll be hearing more about it it's about better jobs better deal is about better job better wages better feature higher pay that means as barbara Lee said equal pay for equal work at the very least as Jackie indicated with rosie the riveter higher pay people pay lower cost lower cost to people but let's see one thing we could lower cost as per dripping prescription drugs little class of there were in the cost of preserving jobs an ending drug price gouging is a way to lower costs for families please crack down on big corporate mergers that hurt consumers workers and competition that helps to lower cost when we stop that and again tools for the 21st century to have the apprenticeships to have the investments in education Wow so that came right from her heart he could feel it right so I'm inspired in fact I want to donate money to the DNC right now because her core essential message is so important to her that she can't remember it she has to literally take off her sunglasses and read it off a pamphlet so that just shows you how empty the DNC is no no me you you were under Nancy Record DNC reconciliation committee as I would know it wish it was oh my god that's what it should be it's the DNC unity reform commission form we have our third meeting on Friday and Saturday in Chicago we can go for Mexican food afterwards that reduces restaurant which we're talking about off camera yeah this is this is the problem here I mean I'm watching and I'm like Nancy Pelosi is utility I think is that she's an amazing fundraiser but that doesn't mean she needs to be the spokesperson or the leader like put barbara lee is their barbara lee would be like good haven't talked about the stuff since i was 17 years old when i was an activist like get someone up there like bernie sanders who speaks for three hours without a script you got to make people feel it so know me i've been saying this on this show on my show i'm TYT everywhere I go I've been saying Nancy Pelosi knows that she doesn't Paul well she knows that she's and this isn't to be insulting but she's repulsive to most of the middle America right and that's how people don't run against Barack Obama when they ran they ran against Nancy Pelosi they still do it so my whole point is she knows she hurts the party when she comes out and speaks like this and she doesn't care she continues to want to be in power to continue to wants to be the face of the party so that to me that's just unbelievable narcissism to the point where it's almost sociopathic where you know you're hurting the power of the party you know you're hurting your country you know you're a flawed spokesperson and that any message you're gonna try to deliver to the people is gonna fall flat because of who you are and you still don't try to fix that or change it or leave it or give it to someone else like you just said give it to barbara Lee or some Bernie or someone else 7 this message instead she comes out she could not be more disconnected she's worth a hundred million dollars she has to read their Court matches off of a brochure for F sake Steve what do you think well I totally agree and and the only reason why well I agree with everything you're saying I'm but I have a bigger problem with Democratic Party is it general when they keep voting for her to be their leader why do you do that well we know a lot somebody else well we know why because she's a big fundraiser that's how you become leaders Chuck Schumer is the leader of the Democrats in the Senate not because he's a leader or because he has a vision or he inspires people is because he gets the most money from Wall Street and he gives it to his friends and then they vote for him to be the leader that's how you become a leader you're the biggest sellout to Wall Street so now you're the head of our party in the Senate so well you know Jimmy hold on let me just say I'm that I'm very excited about the tools for the 21st century and lowering hold on lowering farm whatever luring the tools for the 21st okay you know what I think the tools for the 21st century are I think a jobs program what would that jobs program do I don't know maybe rebuild our infrastructure maybe we can stop poisoning people in the country with lead poisoning so as far as I'm concerned she's not inspiring she's not engaging and I find anytime I go and I look at the new Green Deal that's more interesting to me oh my god yes I think everybody and the other thing too I mean to your point know me she is a great fundraiser but she's that a great fundraiser with everyone she's a great fundraiser with corporate with corporate elites and-and-and big-money donors the 1% yeah she's not a good fundraiser with the with the masses with the grassroot movements so getting her out there to speed a spokesperson to get that to get those folks involved is just a bad strategy it's bad for hers bad for the party's back for everyone involved I don't know why didn't why they don't see that well I also oh I'm sorry I think we also know who's the biggest fundraiser here it's Bernie Sanders Oh without a doubt right right I mean that's why they want his list good luck with that very good you know it's it's fascinating I don't know if I should unveil this right now but maybe I'll break some news huh someone told me that they were getting phone calls a very high donor to the Democratic Party who supported Bernie Sanders but there are folks that are getting phone calls from from the DNC from like more liberal members of the DNC trying to target the donors cuz you can look up like Hoover who gave money to Bernie Sanders and gave maxed out cuz there are some people who did but the average donation was $27 not you know $2,500 or $35,000 in case the DNC so they're now trying to target the Bernie folks who are who can give more money so they can tap into that network because it's easy to look that up so I mean I think the issue with the Democratic Party is and I did a video on this a couple of days ago it's not that they're not raising money it's that they knew that they were going to raise money as much money without a sitting president now as low as 2003 maybe not but the problem is it's not just a brand thing you have Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama who are now targeting the larger donors for their own entities you have Barack Obama who's doing his redistricting effort with Eric Holder which is the job by the way of this thing called the DLC see which should be funded but hasn't been funded because Barack Obama the president was not putting money into the DNC was taking it all for the presidential races and it wasn't going to the states so now he's targeting those high-level donors and putting it into his own fund and Secretary Clinton is now putting it into her own word together PAC and the resistance PAC whatever that is so that they can go and and keep their donors in their circle and continue to start resources from the Democratic so that the Democratic party never has a chance to rebuild itself - to revolutionize not that I trust them to do so anyways because they won't even make their budget transparent and follow their own bylaws Politico had did a story recently Michael Whitney did this this was from August 10th and it's the Democratic Party's looming fundraising crisis and so it's he goes on to say over the first six months of 2017 the Republican National Committee pulled in 75 million nearly twice as much as the Democratic National Committee which raised 38 million now just think about that Trump is president and people aren't giving to the DNC why do you why do you think that is I know why I think it is because the DNC has been proven to cheat half its party that's what so I said this a long time ago as soon as they admitted in the the DNC lawsuit which everyone says is frivolous I say it isn't because it got the DNC to admit that they don't run or have to or have any intention of running a fair primary that they could have it they could choose whatever they want in a smoke-filled room and we got nothing to say about and I said is that your fundraising slogan we don't have to run a fair primary and give us money because it's going to come back to bite you in the ass and it immediately did they immediately had the worst fundraising month they had since 2003 so that's why I think this has happened super-delegates people don't want to give to a to an organization that is inherently rigged and unfair super-delegates is an unfair thing that's something you would think Republicans would do not lefty liberals so that's a big reason I think those are the two big reasons they've been proven to be cheaters Liars cheat their own party they didn't cheat the Republican Party they didn't try to screw over their primary they cheated half their own party their base and they're still doing it hey if you enjoyed this clip of aggressive progressive why not become a member of the TYT Network and you can watch the whole hour you know we do a show every Thursday and then
