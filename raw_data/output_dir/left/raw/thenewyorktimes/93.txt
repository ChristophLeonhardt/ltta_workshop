1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,670
“I’m Jon Turteltaub.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,550
I’m the director of "The Meg."

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:08,840
When the scene begins, this
is Jason Statham swimming out

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,630
to the Megalodon
because they’re

5
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,760
afraid a boat will distract it. 
It'll attack the boat.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,090
So they realize the safest way
is to just swim on your own.

7
00:00:19,915 --> 00:00:23,515
“Just keep swimming,
just keep swimming."

8
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:25,540
Narrator: And as Jason says,
just keep swimming,

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,990
that’s a line that I
borrowed from "Finding Nemo."

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,830
Jason was not exactly
pleased, but he finally

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,030
realized how great it was.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,640
And the thought of
him saying that,

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,160
you just don’t think of him
as a "Finding Nemo" fan.

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,170
Here, you know,
we have a scene

15
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,050
that I kind of built
around GoPro footage

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,090
I’ve seen of people in
the middle of the ocean,

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,860
usually on a surfboard.

18
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,320
And they tend to take their
GoPro, stick it in the water,

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,600
look around, and stick
it back in the water.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,640
And suddenly, there’ll
be a shark there.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,590
And there’s nothing
scarier than knowing

22
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,530
you’re supposed to see
something and not seeing it.

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,940
It’s always what
you don’t see.

24
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,447
So here, we just kept
the suspense going.

25
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:08,780
And sticking your head up,
then sticking your head down.

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,540
And you realize
you’re this close,

27
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,160
and you can’t see a thing.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,570
So the longer you wait,
the better it got.

29
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,340
But eventually, bang, you
gotta see that shark.

30
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,150
Jason, being such a
confident swimmer,

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:27,370
was able to stay out in
this water a lot longer

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,960
than a lot of
actors could have.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
Treading water is not easy.

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Now, when you see
this next shot,

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,850
coming in at the darting — 
bang — that’s 100% CG.

36
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,580
Everything you
see in that shot.

37
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,900
Here, we start
pulling him back in.

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,890
And as the rope goes out,
you see the flinging water.

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,450
That’s called a rooster tail.

40
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,930
I didn’t know what that was.

41
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,260
But what that really is
is something that you —

42
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,370
it helps you see the rope when
that happens in real life.

43
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,560
And then we had to add
it in CG the next time

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,420
so that people could see it.

45
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,300
Again, here, the shark, we’re
seeing very little of it.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,590
It’s always being teased.

47
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,530
It’s always just enough —

48
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,670
a fin, a wake in the water.

49
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,870
Here’s the rooster tail.

50
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:12,290
When he speeds the boat
up, zing, here it comes.

51
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,695
And now you get to see
a little bit more shark.

52
00:02:14,695 --> 00:02:16,070
And that’s one of
the first times

53
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,980
you really see the shark
clearly in the movie.

54
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,640
That is Jason being
pulled through that water.

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,180
Again, not easy.

56
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,870
I don’t think it’s fun
after the 40th time.

57
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,400
Everyone else is
safe on the boat.

58
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
But these shots are a
mixture of CG right there.

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,110
You’ve got a guy in
a tank right there.

60
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,850
You’ve got a CG ocean.

61
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,650
Now you’ve got a
real ocean there.

62
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,150
Now you’ve got a set.

63
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,590
Now you’ve got a fake boat.

64
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,960
Now you’ve got a piece of
set and fake water going

65
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,250
by in the background.

66
00:02:43,250 --> 00:00:00,000
Ugh, it’s a lot."
