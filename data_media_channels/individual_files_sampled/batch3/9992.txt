Otezla. Show more of you. HOWIE: MAJOR NEWS OUTLETS THREATENING TO BOYCOTT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER WITH THE LEFT ATTACKING PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO WASN'T THERE AND THE RIGHT ATTACKING MICHELLE WOLF. IS IT SARAH SANDERS, COUSIN HUCKABEE, WHAT IS UNCLE TOM FOR WHITE WOMEN WHO DISAPPOINT OTHER WHITE WOMEN. MICHELLE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE DECENCY NOT TO COMMENT ON WOMEN'S APPEARANCE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM. SHE IS A MEDIAN, FOR GOD'S SAKE, NOT THE PRESIDENT. HOWIE: JOINING US FROM NEW YORK, KAT TIMPF, A "NATIONAL REVIEW" WRITER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. THERE WERE PERSONAL, CRUDE, HARSH COMMENTS AGAINST SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, AND KELLYANNE AND IVANKA. WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE SAID IF SUCH JOKES WERE MADE ABOUT BARACK AND MICHELLE OR HILLARY? CAT. KAT: THERE WOULDN'T BE THE SAME REACTION. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SAYING IT'S AN OUTRAGE DON'T SAY THAT WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS SOMETHING. HOWIE: YOU FEEL YOU HAVE WRITTEN THIS, THAT THOSE FOLKS, MANY OF THOSE COMMENTATORS GIVE THE PRESIDENT A PASS FOR SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAYS. KAT: PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE FUN OF MIKA'S LOOKS AND ROSIE O'DONNELL. BUT WHEN A MEDIAN WHO THERE IS TO ROAST PEOPLE MAKES FUN OF SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS THEN IT'S AN OUTRAGE. EITHER IT'S AN OUTRAGE ALL THE TIME OR NONE OF THE TIME. IT DRIVES ME NUTS TO SEE THIS. IT'S NOT CONSISTENT. I DO THINK THAT MICHEL WOLF IS A COMEDIAN, NOT THE PRESIDENT. AND THE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD. AND PEOPLE WHO HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY SHE TREATED SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SHOULD HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE WAY PRESIDENT TRUMP TREATED WOMEN IN THE PAST. HOWIE: THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS ASSOCIATION HIRED MICHELLE WOLF KNOWING SHE HAS A HISTORY OF CRUDENESS AND IS ANTI-TRUMP. DOESN'T IT PLAY INTO THE PRESIDENT'S HANDS BY SHOWING THE MEDIA TO BE THE SYMBOL OF THAT DINNER LOOKS TO BE A LOT OF MEDIA BIAS. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME OUT OF THIS LOOKING LIKE A NICE GUY. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS CAME OUT LOOKING NICE AND LIKE A VICTIM. EVEN SOME PEOPLE ON THE LEFT SAID THIS WAS INAPPROPRIATE. THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GETTING INTO. HOWIE: DO YOU SEE THE SAME SELECTIVE OUTRAGE AND COMMENTARY? IMAGINE WHEN BARACK OBAMA WERE UNDER A SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION. WHEN WE SEE CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS SWITCHING SIDES AND SOME OF THE OUTRAGE OR DEFENSE OF THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY HAVE EXPRESSED. WE KNOW FOR A FACT THEY WILL SWITCH SIDE. WE SAW THAT WITH PRESIDENT CLINTON. THEY SAID IT'S JUST SEX, IT DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY. NOW WE ARE SEEING THE SAME TALKING POINTS ON EACH SIDE EXCEPT THEY ARE FLIPPED. HOWIE: "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" DID A STORMY DANIELS SKIT AND DID NOT USE AN ACTRESS. IT'S JUST AN ACT. I WORK IN ADULT FILMS, WE ARE NOT KNOWN FOR OUR ACTING. HOWIE: SHOULD WE REMOVE ANY LAST PRETENSE THIS PROGRAM IS VIRULENTLY ANTI-TRUMP AND NOT ABOUT COMEDY. KAT: IT'S NOT AS FUNNY BECAUSE OF IT BECAUSE WE KNOW WHERE THE JOKES ARE GOING. THE PUNCH LINE IS GOING TO BE THE PRESIDENT IS AN IDIOT, THE PRESIDENT IS A LIAR. THE PEOPLE WATCHING IT AND ENJOY IT WILL HATE PRESIDENT TRUMP NO MATTER WHAT. BUT THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT HIM, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT STORMY DANIELS. HOWIE: ALEC BALDWIN HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE DETESTS PRESIDENT
