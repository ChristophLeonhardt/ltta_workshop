day four nineteen of the Trump administration and the president appears to be engineering a transition a turnover of staff and cabinet we've seen some big departures we have reason to believe more are on the way here is how he describes this effort I've gotten to know a lot of people very well over the last year and I'm really at a point where we're getting very close to having the cabinet and other things that I want tonight veteran reporters Jonathan Swan and Mike Allen have written this for Axios quoting a White House official as saying to them this is the most toxic working environment on the planet usually tough times bring people together but right now this atmosphere is ripping people apart there's no leadership no trust no direction at this point there's very little hope would you want to go to work every day knowing whether your future career was going to be destroyed without explanation what appears to be driving the constant personnel changes is the president's search for unfailingly loyal lieutenants for his team especially those who are willing to be loyal in public well today the White House announced that CNBC regular Larry Kudlow a veteran of the Reagan administration and wall street who's known to many of us and has been a television commentator for decades will be Trump's new chief economic adviser replacing Gary Cohn who announced his departure from the west wing after disagreeing with the President on tariffs Kudlow has been a booster of Donald Trump's on the air and off here is how the two men describe each other I've known him a long time we agree on most he now has come around to believing in tariffs says also in negotiating point you know I'm renegotiating great deals and without tariffs we wouldn't do nearly as well but Larry has been a friend of mine for a long time he backed me very early in the campaign I think the earliest I think he was one of my original backers I've known president a long time we have neutral admiration society he is the president so it's a different role and I will abide by that it may be agreements there may be disagreements we will talk it through but as I said once decisions are made that's it Larry Kudlow enters the president's inner circle just one day after Trump's decision to fire his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and move CIA director Mike Pompeo over into that job another personnel departure that unsettled a number of people at the White House this week involves the president's personal aide Johnny McEntee he held the job known in the trade as the body man the body man is assigned to the President wherever the president is usually when he's up there working including weeknights and weekends they are the carriers of the sharpies the hand sanitizer the breath mints the phone and often the documents McEntee was fired on the spot Monday and escorted off the grounds he was not allowed to go back to his desk to get his personal possessions including but not limited to his jackets the job is vital it calls for a high security clearance because you see and over here everything the boss does Reggie love became something of a reluctant celebrity when he held that same job assisting President Obama in mackynzie's case he is under investigation for potential financial crimes but after his firing at the White House the Trump campaign announced his hiring so a soft landing after a rough exit for him his swift departure underscored the sense of instability among some of the president's closest advisors the president's party has been reluctant to weigh in and today Republican Senator John Thune of South Dakota said he wasn't concerned about these constant changes I just think it's a different it's an it's a it's a sort of unconventional management's to hell this president doesn't do things the way that other administrations have and you know that's sort of I think we've kind of gotten used to that but I think in terms of the turnover that's not unusual the loyal Republican from South Dakota John John Thune amid all of this there is also the growing scandal involving stormy Daniels the porn star who alleges to have had that relationship with Donald Trump before it became president which he denies Donald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels a hundred and thirty grand to keep silent about the alleged relationship and formed a separate company called EC to make that payment well tonight NBC News is reporting that new documents show another lawyer for the Trump organization named Jill Martin quote was involved in trying to enforce a secrecy agreement that adult film star stormy Daniel signed in exchange for 130 grand before the 2016 election other news outlets are also reporting about Jill Martin's involvement in this case tonight stormy Daniels attorney responded to these reports for months we have heard from mr. Cohen and from others associated with the Trump Organization that there was no linkage between EC LLC and the Trump Organization mr. Cohen has maintained that he formed that LLC on his own unbeknownst to mr. Trump unbeknownst to the Trump Organization this idea that there is a separation between EC LLC and Donald Trump and the Trump Organization is a complete and utter fiction on that note we bring in our leadoff panel for yet another busy Wednesday night Michael Crowley national security editor and senior correspondent for Politico Jill Colvin's back with us White House reporter for The Associated Press who was with the president on his whirlwind trip to California in the Midwest and returning after his all too brief appearance last night actually early this morning because of the breaking news we were covering in Pennsylvania is fel Eliot politics correspondent for Time magazine Phil since we used your term of phrase at the top of the broadcast you've called it through your reporting season two for our only president the history of our republic with a background in reality television what is it like what are people inside season 2 telling you they're bracing for high turnover the long and the short of it is no one thinks they are immune from being voted off the island to mix metaphors of a reality show here it was on the way over here I was talking with one White House official who likened it to spring cleaning that the house owner in this case president Trump has an idea on cleaning a house for aesthetic and the housekeeper is trying to open the house for the for the summer and getting rid of everything that's rotten you combine those two and everything they're throwing away you're gonna wind up with a guy stuck with a mortgage and no couch to sit on and a housekeeper looking for a job there really is this dual cleaning of the house that's happening right now between the president getting rid of people he never really liked and chief of staff John Kelly trying to get rid of people who really shouldn't have been there in the first place Jill having covered the White House I know it's frustration when people like me ask people like you what was the mood on the trip the truth is unless the president decides to come back on the plane during one of those legs you don't know and you're limited to talking to the White House aides you've come to know so I'll ask about them some of these folks have families this of course is their livelihood some of these folks are not ideologue but came to work at a job in the White House what's it like for them right now it's at this point in the White House I think you speak to almost any aide and they are clearly having a very rough time there's just a sense of doom and gloom you know people are kind of looking behind them wondering who it is is gonna be next wondering who they can trust and it's just a very kind of depressing place to be around that said I have to say I was quite surprised the president actually seemed to be in a fabulous mood especially as he was departing I'm you know he left for California just after tweeting that he had fired Rex Tillerson he had that scrum that he did as he was leaving the White House where he talked about the reasons why he wanted to do it and the president very much feels at least he's been telling calm that he is feeling empowered that he feels like he is cleaning house right now just like Phil said and that he feels empowered to kind of follow his own instincts he feel like feels like he's been getting bad advice another thing I thought was notable was the chief of staff Sean Kelly who is often almost always around who follows the president when he goes to Maura Lago who you know make sure he's beside him actually dropped off the trip today and decided to stay in California and was not actually with him today and it's what unusual for the two of them to be separate interesting we will leave that where it lays mr. Crowley I know because you shared it with one of our producers you and I are of the same belief one of the key people to watch right now is general mattis across the Pentagon across the Potomac at the Pentagon absolutely Brian I'm struck in all the conversations about shake ups and changes that we never hear general mattis's name and I think at the time when Madison does get swept up in in all this if he does you're gonna see a kind of new level of alarm categorically different that will really shake foreign capitals as well Jim mattis is a kind of rock of pragmatism wisdom he's seen as a you know mature serious thoughtful military figure who has restrained some of the president's more impulsive ideas when it comes to national security and military policy in America on the world stage and I think that a great many people who dislike Trump take a lot of comfort in the idea that Jim mattis is there he is essentially you know legally he can't stop Donald Trump from pressing the nuclear button but he is in his ear on those gravest issues of national security and military matters and and I just AM sort of waiting for the day when we find out that mattis has run afoul of President Trump I think that will be possibly one of the most dramatic developments in this kind of soap opera of Trump personnel I stress again that there's no information that makes me think that Trump and mattis do have a bad relationship but show me someone who is sort of an and figure who is kind of conventional again pragmatic non-ideological with whom Trump has been able to get along with for a long period of time and maintain a trust bond with so that's the relationship I'm watching most closely right now Brian Phil I don't want to turn this into Gail Sheehy meets dr. Phil but between Keith Schiller and hope Hicks I keep thinking about this as well those are two comfort level people in the first year of this White House Keith Schiller course head of security for Donald Trump in New York very easy relationship Navy veteran former New York police officer ho pix was with this campaign from its embryonic first hours they're both out of the president's life now and again because that that immediate atmosphere around him looms so large and seem so important it's those two vacancies I think about a lot and you're right to think about them that way they were really the souvenirs from the campaign the the tchotchkes that sat right outside the Oval Office for the longest time who could remind Trump that this used to be fun that winning the campaign was fun dispatching the Republican rivals dispatching Hillary Clinton he had a lot of fun doing that and they could remind him of that they were kind of like mascots to him they were also very useful to White House staff that the president really wouldn't listen to everyone but if they could have hope Hicks say something in a meeting the president would pay attention if there was an inclination that the president was going perhaps off the rails they could maybe have Keith perhaps suggested nimbly gently and the president would he that they were really the the bumpers they were like if you're going bowling they were the the things that keep you out of the gutter they're both gone now the closest thing we have an hour Ivanka and Jared and there's no there's no there are no signs that they have the bandwidth to sit outside the Oval Office all day every day to be at the president's side holding his elbow trying to steer him away from some of his own worst instincts and to be clear the president doesn't want guided any more he feels that he was ill served by people who kept him away from his own instincts and he's really ready in this second season of here presidency to let hit to produce his own show hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
