and here's the winner last night of that big upset victory in that statewide race for a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court I'm glad to say that we won this race and I'm headed to the Supreme Court tonight we proved that when the people rise up and stand together we can beat the special-interest dollars that were spent on this race flooding into our state that was Rebecca Dalit in her victory speech last night and Rebecca Dalit joins us now from Wisconsin having been elected to a 10-year term on the Wisconsin State Supreme Court thank you very much for joining us tonight on your first national interview about this and I just want to get into the role the NRA played in this campaign and what was what were you saying about it and what was your opponents saying about well thank you Lawrence for having me my opponent was endorsed by the NRA within 24 hours of the parklands shooting and I believe that that caused a lot of national attention to be drawn to this race when we talk about the NRA right now and as a parent of three daughters in high school in college we talk about families like mine being afraid of having their kids in school and my opponent vowed to protect the firearm freedoms of the NRA they sent out mailers to that effect and I think Wisconsin eights were very concerned with that and as a political matter in Wisconsin what were the risks for you in taking on the NRA well we have had a situation in Wisconsin for the last decade the years that I've been a judge where we've had special interests money pouring into these Supreme Court races and money like groups like the NRA and other business lobbies and other groups and that money has been buying justice or a justice we've then had Supreme Court justices like the one I announced against justice gable men sitting on cases that involve parties that spent that money and refusing to step off of those cases and then ruling in the favor of those groups that spent the money Wisconsinites have seen that this isn't fair and they've lost confidence in our courts and I think this win was a win for Wisconsin and a win against special interests like the NRA trying to buy our courts you also had some outside help from Eric Holder or and packed the the that he was organized in supporting how important was that in your win well I was grateful to have help of groups like the Eric Holder's group the difference between me and my opponent I made this statement and the promise to the voters that any group that spends money significantly on my race I will not hear the cases involving those groups should they come in front of the court and I think that's a big difference of what means we're gonna have fair and independent courts in the eyes of the voters and this is a ten year term and so you're gonna be wielding influence on that court for a long time to come this is this is what makes it such an important race and and at what point did you feel looking for this or did you know you were gonna go over the top by 12 points well it's hard to know I knew that going around the state my message really resonated with voters and I traveled our state far and wide since June first and my message was one of experience I've worked in our courts for more than 23 years standing up for victims in some of the toughest cases of rape and child abuse both as a prosecutor and a judge and I spoke out against the special interest that have really bought our courts or appeared to buy our courts for the last decade the message really resonated with voters and I was certainly hopeful that they would turnout which they did in great numbers last night what would you say to Democrats who are concerned about standing up to the NRA in some of their districts some of their congressional districts around the country some of them want to but feel that it might be too politically risky well I think that we all need to talk about fairness and independence on especially in our courts and when we have special interests money that is influencing and taking the place of the people we all need to stand up to that we've seen in this country as we all know this real interest on the part of our young people and I one of my daughter's helped lead the walkout at her school I participated in the March for our lives with one of my other daughters we've seen a real interest taken in safety and gun violence prevention it's a national conversation that I think everyone needs to be a part of Wisconsin State Supreme Court justice elect Rebecca dalla thank you very much for joining us tonight really appreciate it thank you so much for having me thank you hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
