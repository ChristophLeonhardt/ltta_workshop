1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:03,223
TRUMP AND OTHERS ARE COMING WITH

2
00:00:03,223 --> 00:00:06,927
THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS.

3
00:00:06,927 --> 00:00:10,430
THAT WILL BE GREATLY CHEER

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:10,964
WOULD.

5
00:00:10,964 --> 00:00:13,266
BHAR MAR IS GENERAL JACK KEAN

6
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:15,101
AUTHORITY E, GENERAL, IT IS

7
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,203
GREAT TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS.

8
00:00:17,203 --> 00:00:19,773
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU, MARTHA.

9
00:00:19,773 --> 00:00:21,274
>> Martha: SO MANY STEPS FORWARD

10
00:00:21,274 --> 00:00:24,744
AND THIS IS A DISTURBING

11
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:28,248
DEVELOPMENT WHAT WE ARE WATCHING

12
00:00:28,248 --> 00:00:28,582
HERE.

13
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:30,617
>> NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

14
00:00:30,617 --> 00:00:32,586
SYRIA REPRESENTS THE ANCHOR IN

15
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:35,121
THE REGION AND THEY WANT TO GAIN

16
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:36,389
MORE DOMINANCE OF THE COUNT

17
00:00:36,389 --> 00:00:38,224
ROPES IN THE AREA AND CASE POINT

18
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:39,459
IS ISRAEL.

19
00:00:39,459 --> 00:00:41,461
FOR MONTHS NOW.

20
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:42,862
IRANIANS ARE CONDUCTING

21
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:47,100
A MILITARY BUILD UP IN SOUTHERN

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,969
AND SOUTHWESTERN SYRIA WITH THE

23
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:52,539
PURPOSE OF ENCROACHING ON

24
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:55,208
ISRAELI SOVEREIGNTY, AND

25
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:55,609
SECURITY.

26
00:00:55,609 --> 00:00:59,479
THEY WANT TO DO WHAT THEY DID IN

27
00:00:59,479 --> 00:00:59,846
LEBANON.

28
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:02,048
WHERE HESBOLLAH HAS 30000 ROCKET

29
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:05,619
AND MISSILES CAPABLE OF REACHING

30
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:06,820
TEL AVIV AND JERUSALEM.

31
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,356
AND THEY WANT TO DO IT IN SYRIA

32
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:13,760
AND SO THAT IT WOULD OVERWHELM

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,328
ISRAEL'S MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM

34
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,631
AND THE TARGETS WOULD BE TEL

35
00:01:17,631 --> 00:01:19,466
AVIV AND JERUSALEM.

36
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:21,368
THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF WHAT IRAN

37
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:22,702
IS UP TO.

38
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:24,404
THEY WANT TO UNDERMINE THE

39
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:26,406
GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL AND CREATE

40
00:01:26,406 --> 00:01:28,041
INSTABILITY IN THE COUNTRY AND

41
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:30,677
IN TIME DESTROY IT.

42
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:32,579
THAT'S SOMETHING THEY SAY EVERY

43
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:35,315
SINGLE YEAR AND THE ISRAELIS

44
00:01:35,315 --> 00:01:36,783
DIDN'T COME BACK WITH

45
00:01:36,783 --> 00:01:38,318
A PORPORTIONATE STRIKE.

46
00:01:38,318 --> 00:01:40,687
THEY CAME BACK WITH AN

47
00:01:40,687 --> 00:01:42,522
OVERWHELMING RESPONSE AS WAS

48
00:01:42,522 --> 00:01:43,957
MENTIONED IN THE INTRODUCTION.

49
00:01:43,957 --> 00:01:46,259
>> Martha: IS THAT WISE ON THEIR

50
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:46,660
PART?

51
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,695
THERE IS NO WAY ISRAEL WILL

52
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:49,863
TOLERATE THE BUILD UP.

53
00:01:49,863 --> 00:01:52,899
AND THAT LEADS TO A QUESTION OF

54
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,101
DOES THIS LEAD TO ALL OUT WAR

55
00:01:55,101 --> 00:02:01,241
BETWEEN IRAN AND ISRAEL.

56
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:02,208
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

57
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,277
THEY WERE JUST WAITING FOR

58
00:02:04,277 --> 00:02:08,648
SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

59
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:11,351
ROUHANI ORDERED THE STRIKE.

60
00:02:11,351 --> 00:02:13,920
AND ISRAEL TOOK OUT JUST ABOUT

61
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,789
ALL OF THEIR MILITARY

62
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:16,289
INFRASTRUCTURE.

63
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:19,659
IT IS IT A HECK OF A PRICE THE

64
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:20,894
IRANIANS WILL PAY.

65
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:23,496
THE DEPTH PATTERN IS NEVER GET

66
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,532
THEIR OWN FORCES INVOLVED IN

67
00:02:25,532 --> 00:02:28,068
A CONFLICT EXCEPT FOR THE EIGHT

68
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:32,539
YEARS THEY FOUGHT WITH SADDAM

69
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:33,473
HUSSEIN.

70
00:02:33,473 --> 00:02:35,241
THAT WILL SEND A LOUD MISSAGE TO

71
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:37,310
THE IRANIANS.

72
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,512
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HESBOLLAH

73
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:42,215
WILL NOT CAUSE PROBLEMS AND IT

74
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,250
DOESN'T MEAN THAT ISRAEL WILL

75
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,787
NOT RESPOND TO HESBOLLAH, BUT I

76
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:49,756
DON'T THINK IT WILL LEAD TO ALL

77
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:50,457
OUT WAR.

78
00:02:50,457 --> 00:02:53,226
THAT IS NOT IN IRAN'S INTEREST.

79
00:02:53,226 --> 00:02:55,995
>> Martha: THEY ARE PUSHING AND

80
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:57,864
HOW THEY RESPOND WILL BE

81
00:02:57,864 --> 00:02:58,264
CRUCIAL.

82
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:02,168
WE WATCHED ONE OF THE SOUND

83
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:04,738
BITS, FROM MIKE POMPEO, THE NEW

84
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:05,538
SECRETARY OF STATE.

85
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:08,141
WHAT DOES IT TELL US WHAT WE

86
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:11,444
WATCHED THIS WEEK, GENERAL.

87
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:14,647
THE RETURNING OF HOSTAGES AND

88
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,483
THE TWO POSITIVE MEETING WITH

89
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:18,351
KIM JONG-UN ABOUT THE

90
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:19,486
EFFECTIVENESS OF SECRETARY OF

91
00:03:19,486 --> 00:03:19,819
STATE.

92
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:22,555
>> I THINK HE'S THE STAR OF THE

93
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:24,090
ADMINISTRATION SENSE HE WAS IN

94
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,059
THE CIA AND SUPER STAR AS A

95
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,661
RESULT OF THE POSITION HE'S IN.

96
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:31,765
AND IT IS POMPEO'S VISIT THAT

97
00:03:31,765 --> 00:03:33,967
GAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP HIS

98
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:35,502
OPTIMISM AND WHY HIS LANGUAGE

99
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:37,771
AND RHETORIC INCREASED AS A

100
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:40,240
RESULT OF POMPEO'S INTERACTION

101
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,075
WITH KIM JONG-UN.

102
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:45,044
I RETURNED FROM JAPAN AND

103
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,846
LOADERS IN THE GOVERNMENT ARE

104
00:03:46,846 --> 00:03:48,648
ECHOING THIS.

105
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,049
THEY SEE A POTENTIAL FOR A BREAK

106
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:50,717
THROUGH HERE.

107
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,252
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT KIM JONG-UN

108
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:54,654
IS GOING TO HAND US OVER ALL OF

109
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,591
HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THEY WILL

110
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:00,293
PROBABLY NOT GIVE ALL OF THOSE

111
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:01,327
WEAPONS TO US.

112
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:04,130
BUT THERE IS IT POTENTIAL TO

113
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,265
GENUINELY MAKE PROGRESS.

114
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:06,533
AND I THINK THIS ADMINISTRATION

115
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,902
WILL BE TOUGH MINDS ABOUT

116
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:12,605
HOLDING TO THEIR STANDARD WHICH

117
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:18,178
IS COMPLETE DPE NUCLEARATION.

118
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:20,012
>> Martha: IT APPEARS OF

119
00:04:20,012 --> 00:04:23,650
A CHANGE OF TUNE FROM KIM

120
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,017
JONG-UN.

121
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,685
THE PRESIDENT THINKS THAT AND DO

122
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:25,985
YOU?

123
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:27,086
>> I DO.

124
00:04:27,086 --> 00:04:30,123
HE'S MOVING TO A DIFFERENT PLACE

125
00:04:30,123 --> 00:04:30,523
CERTAINLY.

126
00:04:30,523 --> 00:04:32,158
AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE

127
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:34,027
SANCTIONS CAUSED A PROBLEM TO

128
00:04:34,027 --> 00:04:36,029
HIM AND THE RECOGNITION THAT

129
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,031
THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE AND

130
00:04:38,031 --> 00:04:39,432
THERE IS A MILITARY OPTION ON

131
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:42,735
THE TABLE AND HE HAS POTENTIAL

132
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:47,707
TO INCREASE PROSPER ETFOR HIS

133
00:04:47,707 --> 00:00:00,000
COUNTRY AND HIMSELF AND THEY ARE
