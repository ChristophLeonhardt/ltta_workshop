PROTECT SOURCES. Shannon: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CONGRESSMAN JIM JORDAN SAID THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE MAY HOLD A HEARING ON THE SURVEILLANCE OF ALI WATKINS. JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT IS CHRIS STEWART FROM UTAH. THE CONGRESSMAN ON THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. GOOD EVENING. Shannon: I WANT TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR REACTION TO WHAT HAS BEEN BREAKING WITH THESE LEAKS. YOU KNOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS WITH THE INFORMATION GATHERING BODY THAT INFORMATION IS SENSITIVE. SOMETHING WE HEARD FROM THE FBI SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE WHO CARRIED OUT THE CASE INVOLVING JAMES WOLFE SAID HIS ARREST DEMONSTRATES THE CONDUCT WILL NOT BE TOLERATE AND THOSE ENGAGED IN IT WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. HOW MUCH IS THIS SENDING A MESSAGE TO OTHERS? I HOPE IT DOES. IT'S AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM. WE HAVE ACCESS TO SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY SENSITIVE INFORMING IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE TALKED WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THE PROBLEM OF THE LEAKS. I THINK THERE'S TWO PROBLEMS HERE. ONE IS AS YOU'VE DISCUSSED WITH SOME OF YOUR REPORTERS, THERE'S AN ISSUE OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS. I'LL LET OTHERS TALK ABOUT THAT. THE ONE THING I CAN TALK ABOUT WITH CLARITY AND THAT'S MOST OF THAT PROBLEM GOES AWAY IF PEOPLE DON'T LEAK CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL AND LEGAL RESPONSIBILITY NOT TO LEAK THIS KIND OF INFORMATION AND IT HAS IMPLICATION FOR OUR SECURITY AND A HOPE WE GO AFTER THESE GUYS HARD. I'VE SAID THAT A THOUSAND TIMES. Shannon: THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT THE TOUGH INTERSECTION OF FREEDOM OF THE PRESS WHICH HE SAID HE SUPPORTS BUT PROSECUTING THOSE WHO DIVULGE AND LEAK INFORMATION. ESPECIALLY IN THIS ADMINISTRATION SEEMS LIKE A TOUGH PROBLEM. ANOTHER TOUGH PROBLEM IS THE ISSUE OF IMMIGRATION AND THE ALLEGATIONS OF CHILDREN BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS WHEN THEY COME ACROSS THE BORDER. THE CURRENT ICE DIRECTOR SAID THIS ABOUT WHEN KIDS GET SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. CHILDREN AND PARENTS GET SEPARATED IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN A PARENT IS CHARGED WITH A CRIMINAL EFFECT. IT'S SAD TO SEE A CHILD CRY WHEN YOU TAKE A PARENT BUT BECAUSE IT'S SAD DOESN'T MEAN YOU IGNORE THE LAW. Shannon: HE SAID THE PARENTS ARE THE ONES ENDANGERING THE KIDS. WHAT DO YOU SAY? VERY QUICKLY ON THE PREVIOUS SUBJECT, THE FACT YOU DON'T LIKE THE PRESIDENT AND MAY NOT AGREE WITH HIS POLITICS DOES NOT GIVE YOU AUTHORITY TO LEAK CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. I WANT TO PUT OUT THAT THERE. THE NEXT QUESTION ABOUT IMMIGRATION. PEOPLE. IT'S DISTURBING I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THERE'S COMPLICATED FACTORS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT. ONE IS WHAT HE JUST SAID. WE'VE DISCOVERED SOME PARENTS HAVE A CRIMINAL HISTORY AND IN SOME CASES THERE'S EVIDENCE OF TRAFFICKING OR EXPLOITING THE CHILDREN AND CURRENT COURT ORDERS ONLY ALLOW YOU TO DETAIN THE CHILD FOR NINE DAYS AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN FOSTER CARE OR A RELATIVE. THAT FORCE THE SEPARATIONS. THERE'S THINGS WE CAN DO. ONE, WE NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON FAMILY DETENTION CENTERS ALLOWING THAT OPTION AND THE SECOND THING IS WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE LEGAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CURRENT COURT ORDER THAT FORCE THE SEPARATION AT NINE DAYS AND TRY TO KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ENTER THE COUNTRY. THE FACT YOU SHOW UP AT YOUR BORDER WITH YOUR CHILDREN DOESN'T GUARANTEE ACCESS TO THE COUNTRY. WE STILL NEED TO SECURE BORDERS. I THINK WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE MANY OF US UNCOMFORTABLE. Shannon: IT'S GUT WRENCHING AND LOTS OF EMOTION ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE AND GOES BACK TO THE ISSUE OF THE BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH I KNOW
