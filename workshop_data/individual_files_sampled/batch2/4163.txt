now to our beat special report tonight on a major policy challenge in our politics today how does our expensive election system potentially make us more vulnerable to foreign espionage this is not a partisan issue or one concerning only Russian interference although of course that is one way we are seeing the problem exposed right now consider how millions of dollars made their way from Russia at the United States through one of the most powerful political groups in America and one which swung into action for Donald Trump the NRA which dropped 31 million on Trump that's more than double its investment in the previous GOP nominee Mitt Romney now the NRA has every right to increase its spending and it's long known for supporting conservative and GOP candidates but recent reports also show a long-term effort by Russia to infiltrate the organization all of this predating the Trump campaign and the questions have gone into overdrive now that federal prosecutors indicted a Russian Maria boo Tina for using conservative and gun rights groups to try to infiltrate an impact US politics that probe is separate from Bob Miller and it's another sign that the legal and national security efforts to counter Russian interference are significant are not a witch hunt and are much broader than 2016 and however you feel about it now tonight we know this is not the first time that experts have sought to get to the bottom of this vulnerability in the context of the NRA Democratic Senator Ron Wyden a critic of big money in politics writ large was a back pushing the NRA all the way years ago and he told and the group ultimately told him that since 2015 it had about 2,500 dollars from people associated with Russian addresses and they played down the whole problem by noting these were routine payments from about 23 people for membership dues or magazine subscriptions and that does sound small also under the fairly weak federal transparency laws the NRA only needs to tell the IRS privately about the identities of donors who give over five thousand dollars a year but even that little rule well they've been ducking that requirement another public official took on that problem with the NRA then California Attorney General Kamala Harris she is now a u.s. senator and she was pushing the NRA in 2015 for failing to follow rules and pony up a list of financial information three years running from 2012 to 2014 in fact the state of California now labels the NRA as delinquent it appears that the tax filings in California for 2015 and the critical year of 2016 they're incomplete as well so what does the NRA s response to these holes which are looking more suspicious giving the new reports and pressure well we asked them directly for a comment we have not heard back and then it gets worse the Trump administration has now changed a rule so that the NRA won't have to report any of these donations to the IRS in the future this is what campaign finance reformers call a big dark money problem now that is the transparency side that's what we would all see as citizens or journalists or yada-yada on the investigative side Bob Muller can subpoena the NRA tax records and legal experts tell us it's highly likely Muller already has them from at least the years around the election based on the kind of moves he's been making so it does go back to the famous phrase follow the money and we also know some of that money was spent as far back as 2013 that's when NRA leadership jumped at the chance to visit Moscow for a talk about gun policy you can see the NRA s former president former because before all these reports about Russian money came out there was a sudden leadership shake-up that sent Ollie north to lead the group here they were in Russia with everyone both in the United States and of course Rogers over the course of the last three years you're senator Alexander fortune that the National Rifle Association any meetings there are no people there are more alike than Americans in Russia for shooters who you all say if you value the same kinds of things and we need to work together that former NRA president was talking about Senator Alexander tortion a Russian oligarch linked to Putin who was able to actually get to Donald Trump jr. at an NRA event in the middle of the campaign spring 2016 which brings us back to that new indictment as Rachel Maddow has reported tortion was behind the very implausible Russian gun group that they now indicted Maria boo Tina used for her influence campaign now the right to bear arms is purportedly a gun rights group founded by a senior member of Putin's political party which is called United Russia what's funny about that whole concept is that Vladimir Putin and his party United Russia they don't actually support gun rights in Russia so why did they create this group that purports to promote that Putin doesn't support gun rights any more than he supports free elections to replace him so our question tonight was this quite obvious front group a trick that was pulled on the NRA or a trick that the NRA was in on and does the NRA s multi-year efforts to hide their donors reflect a kind of a innocent reflexive secrecy for no reason which is possible or alternatively is it an effort to keep all this money in the dark because it would look way worse under the lights we turn now to an expert who has been all over this contributing editor to Rolling Stone Tim Dickinson has investigated the NRA s dark money your view of what we know now well it's remarkable wheat in April did a report about boo Tina and torsion and their efforts to infiltrate the NRA over about a decade and since we came out with that publication torsion is now subject to sanctions and Maria boo Tina is in prison without in jail without bail so but I think you've hit the nail on the head it is this was this a concerted what did the Russians pull the wool over the eyes the NRA or where the NRA was the NRA sort of a a willing participant in this and that's that's I think the open question that we're left with in this butene of saga but it is really interesting that right after boo tina was rated the nrj has a very orderly plan of succession and they disrupted that entirely booting out the guy who had been in Russia with the NRA sort of elite money raisers with Bou tina and torsion and then replaced him with with oliver north so it's it's looking a bit like a cover up in that regard well that's why we're so curious about about all your deep reporting on this because legally there are many cases that turn on people being stupid and at a distance people think there's a master conspiracy and in fact people were stupid they were do they were greedy but the nra is such a sophisticated political operation and it may be internet gives them too much credit well that's what I'm asking you international in their ambition did they have no idea that in an authoritarian country like Russia there's not a lot of people rooting for you know gun rights to help challenge Putin well I mean the they had a really high suspension of disbelief and I think this attractive young Russian who was in charge of this group was part of that I mean you look at unindicted co-conspirator alleged Paul Erickson the fifty year old who was allegedly in a relationship with this woman and and working with her it just seems like a lot of these people got in deep and over their heads and sort of got on a slippery slope and I don't think they quite knew where it was headed so you're saying you're using a kind of a artistic term suspension of disbelief so it's a kind of a cross between diehard and a honeypot situation and people just put out of their mind the fact that this doesn't seem like it'd be a real group yeah I think people they wanted to believe that the Russians were in fact on our side on their side that the Russians are promoting gun rights you me same same we all have the same interests and I just want to be clear if that's right what you're saying that would be good for the NRA legally because whatever one thinks of their politics that would be that that they didn't try to deuce do anything wrong per se well it's unclear bright because then they then they were their top money people in Moscow meeting with top Russian policymakers and perhaps you know oligarchs and so did they end up and then taking money willingly or through some sort of conduit I mean it could have been a an LLC like Trump used to pay off the pornstars same kind of vehicle could have easily brought money into the NRA in a way that wouldn't have a Russian address on it so the the the you know the NRA s denials on this stuff are very you know you wouldn't trust those much farther than you could throw them right and that's what we noted in our reporting and their failure to address even the basics of this if they have a good other side of the story why not put it out and yet some of your reporting reflects the idea that they may have been duped and that alone might just simply be embarrassing there's a lot more here you've been a big leader on it so I'm glad you're willing to come on the beat and tell us about it hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
