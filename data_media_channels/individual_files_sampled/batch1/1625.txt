Irish people have been given an important choice campaigners from both sides of the argument have been bringing the debate to the people Islands voting on whether to repeal the 8th amendment of the country's constitution that all but bans abortion the law says that the life of a mother and unborn fetus are equal abortions only allowed if there's a serious risk to the mother's life not in cases of rape incest or serious abnormality those that break the law face a maximum 14-year prison sentence Siobhan Donohue is a doctor she's voting YES to repeal the Eighth Amendment she was pregnant with her third child when things started to go wrong we discovered that our baby had a condition called Anna carefully meant that the top half of his head had never formed so that was nothing about his eyes no brain no scope no scope and it meant we knew then that our baby would not survive under Irish law she born would have to carry the chant a full term possibly another 20 weeks she traveled to Liverpool in the UK for an abortion just being alone in a foreign country when you're dealing with this and then having the indignity of giving birth and then several hours later having to board a plane to come home and then a couple of weeks later the ring on my doorbell and it's the courier and he has the ashes of my baby this is where the debate is gathering momentum on high streets up and down the country here in the capital Dublin the yes camp and the no camper out in force campaigning side by side as you can probably imagine there are some heated moments here the result of this referendum will say an awful lot about how far Island has changed and how far is prepared to carry on changing this is how the No campaign are getting their message across they believe that if the law changes it will mean abortion on demand many are backing no for religious reasons the Catholic Church that once dominated Irish society strongly opposes it from the moment of conception until natural death Catholics believe that human life is sacred and therefore worthy of protection when it comes to the issue of the the unborn we believe that worthy of special protection in in law but increasingly even people with religious beliefs are choosing a different path helped by political leaders like the country's prime minister who backs a change in the law the government's proposed allowing unlimited access to abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy subject to medical advice if the referendum is passed for many in this debate that's a step too far both sides say they're seeking a compassionate answer to a difficult question Neve Barker al-jazeera Dublin
