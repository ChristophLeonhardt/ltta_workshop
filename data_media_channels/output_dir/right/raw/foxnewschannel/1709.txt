MAJOR LEAKS THAT IF WHITE HOUSE

00:00:05,615 --> 00:00:08,384
DEFENSE TO PUT AN END TO THIS

5
00:00:08,384 --> 00:00:08,684
FLOW.

6
00:00:08,684 --> 00:00:12,588
A MAN JOINING ME NOW, FORMER

7
00:00:12,588 --> 00:00:13,256
WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY

8
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:13,756
SEAN SPICER.

00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,126
BOOK, THE BRIEFING, WHICH WE ARE

13
00:00:21,664 --> 00:00:22,565
WHILE MATT, SEAN.

14
00:00:22,565 --> 00:00:25,134
PEOPLE USING THE MEDIA TO SHE

15
00:00:25,134 --> 00:00:30,740
SHIV          SHIV

16
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:31,140
EACH OTHER.

17
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,342
IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ARE GOING

18
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:35,144
TO BE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL GET

19
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:35,578
FIRED.

20
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:36,312
>> MIGHT ONCE HAVE STARTED TO

21
00:00:36,312 --> 00:00:40,349
HEAL SO I FEEL PRETTY GOOD.

22
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:41,350
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

23
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,285
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE HONOR TO BE

24
00:00:42,285 --> 00:00:43,352
ABLE TO WORK AT THE WHITE HOUSE

25
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:44,620
AND SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

26
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,555
AND HELP IMPLEMENT THE

27
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:46,289
PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND ANYBODY

28
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,059
WHO GOES THERE AND LEAKS REALLY

29
00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:50,993
UNDERMINES BOTH THE HONOR THAT

30
00:00:50,993 --> 00:00:52,862
THE PRESIDENT HAS BESTOWED UPON

31
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:54,630
THEM AND THE AGENDA THAT THE

32
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,598
PRESIDENT IS PURSUING ON BEHALF

33
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:57,533
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I

34
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,835
THINK KELLY ANNA'S ABSOLUTELY

35
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:01,938
RIGHT.

36
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:03,272
ANY UNAUTHORIZED LEAKS

37
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:03,706
INFORMATION --

38
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:04,674
>> Martha: THIS IS LIKE A YEAR

39
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:05,074
AND A HALF.

40
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:09,078
ALL THE CYCLES OF PEOPLE IN THE

41
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:09,779
COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT AND

42
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:11,581
THEN JOHN KELLY WAS BROUGHT IN.

43
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:13,416
THIS WAS GOING TO STOP THE

44
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:13,716
LEAKS.

45
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:14,750
ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI SAID HE WAS

46
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,153
GOING TO STOP THE LEAKS.

47
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:17,954
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

48
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:20,590
HOW TOUGH IS IT TO RUN A TIGHTER

49
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,560
OPERATION?

50
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,362
>> PEOPLE HAVE VERY INGENIOUS

51
00:01:26,362 --> 00:01:28,164
WAYS THESE DAYS, ENCRYPTED APPS,

52
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:29,031
ET CETERA TO GO AFTER EACH OTHER

53
00:01:29,031 --> 00:01:30,700
BUT I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM

54
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,567
IS THAT YOU'VE GOT A MEDIA

55
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:32,802
THAT'S WILLING TO TAKE ANY STORY

56
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,538
THAT COMES FROM ANYBODY THAT

57
00:01:35,538 --> 00:01:38,941
WANTS TO AS KELLY AND PUT IT,

58
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:39,909
SHIV THEIR FELLOW EMPLOYEES SO

59
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,379
THAT THERE IS A WILLING AUDIENCE

60
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:44,113
TO GET RETRIBUTION OR UNDERMINE

61
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:48,451
SOMEONE ELSE'S AGENDA AND SCORE

62
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,118
POLITICAL -- PETTY POLITICAL

63
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,255
POINTS IF THEY DON'T WANT TO

64
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:53,155
UNDERMINES MODELS ON THE TEAM.

65
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,891
I THINK THAT'S SAD, THAT'S WRONG

66
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:56,559
AND I THINK KELLY AND AS I

67
00:01:56,559 --> 00:01:57,193
MENTIONED IS RIGHT.

68
00:01:57,193 --> 00:01:58,794
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CAUGHT DOING

69
00:01:58,794 --> 00:01:59,428
THAT UNDERMINE WHAT THIS

70
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:01,464
PRESIDENT IS WORKING HARD TO DO

71
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:03,366
AND DISTRACT FROM HIS ABILITY TO

72
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,067
IMPLEMENT AND DRIVE A MESSAGE

73
00:02:05,067 --> 00:02:05,968
THAT CARES ABOUT THE AMERICAN

74
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:06,302
PEOPLE.

75
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:07,970
>> Martha: THE BIG ONE THIS

76
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,005
WEEK WAS THIS WOMAN AND WHAT YOU

77
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,940
SAID ABOUT JOHN McCAIN, VERY

78
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,774
HEARTLESS COMMENTS AND I GUESS

79
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:16,178
SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T LIKE HER

80
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,748
SHIVVED HER AS KELLY AND SAID.

81
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:19,482
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN

82
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,250
TO HER?

83
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,252
>> I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE

84
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,453
INFORMATION THAT HAPPENED OR

85
00:02:24,453 --> 00:02:26,556
EXACTLY WHAT DID BUT I WILL TELL

86
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:29,225
YOU THIS, SENATOR MCCAIN AND

87
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,626
ANYBODY WHO HAS SUFFERED FROM

88
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:33,663
ANY OF THESE HORRIFIC DISEASES

89
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:35,898
SHOULD HAVE OUR UTMOST SYMPATHY

90
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:36,332
AND PRAYERS.

91
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,834
REGARDLESS OF THE CONTEXT THAT

92
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,403
IT SET IN, I BELIEVE AS A

93
00:02:40,403 --> 00:02:41,737
CATHOLIC THAT IF WE MAKE A

94
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:43,773
MISTAKE, WE ASK FOR FORGIVENESS

95
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:45,942
AND WE FORGIVE.

96
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:46,976
IF IT WAS SET I WOULD IMPLORE

97
00:02:46,976 --> 00:02:48,144
HER TO ASK FOR FORGIVENESS AND

98
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:50,413
THOSE WHO WERE HURT BY THAT, TO

99
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:51,747
EQUALLY GIVE THE FORGIVENESS.

100
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:53,215
BUT RIGHT NOW OUR THOUGHTS AND

101
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:53,950
PRAYERS ARE WITH SENATOR MCCAIN

102
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,953
AND ALL THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM

103
00:02:56,953 --> 00:02:57,687
DISEASES THAT ARE TAKING AWAY

104
00:02:57,687 --> 00:02:58,554
FROM THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE A

105
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:00,556
NORMAL AND HEALTHY LIFE.

106
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:04,694
AND SO I WISH WE COULD GET OVER

107
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:06,696
THIS IN A WAY THAT HONORS

108
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:10,366
SENATOR MCCAIN AND EXPRESSES OUR

109
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:13,235
THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS FOR HIM AND

110
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:13,636
HIS FAMILY.

111
00:03:13,636 --> 00:03:14,337
>> Martha: I HEAR YOU.

112
00:03:14,337 --> 00:03:16,372
I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT.

113
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:17,540
THIS IS JOHN KELLY, THE CHIEF OF

114
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,943
STAFF, ON NPR.

115
00:03:20,943 --> 00:03:22,144
>> IN RETROSPECT, I WISH I HAD

116
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:24,380
BEEN HERE FROM DAY ONE.

117
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:24,747
>> HOW SO?

118
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:25,715
>> IN TERMS OF STAFFING OR

119
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:29,251
SERVING THE PRESIDENT, THE FIRST

120
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,987
SIX MONTHS WAS PRETTY CHAOTIC.

121
00:03:30,987 --> 00:03:32,088
THERE WERE PEOPLE HIRED THAT

122
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,557
MAYBE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIRED.

123
00:03:34,557 --> 00:03:36,559
IT'S NOT THAT THINGS WERE A

124
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:37,760
DISASTER THAT FIRST SIX MONTHS,

125
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,794
BUT I BELIEVE THEY COULD HAVE

126
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:39,195
BEEN BETTER.

127
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:41,364
>> Martha: DO YOU THINK, TAKE

128
00:03:41,364 --> 00:03:42,698
THAT PERSONALLY I GUESS IS THE

129
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:43,432
FIRST QUESTION AND DO YOU THINK

130
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,233
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF HE

131
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,335
HAD BEEN THERE FROM THE

132
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:52,375
BEGINNING?

133
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:53,609
>> I HAVE A TON OF RESPECT FOR

134
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:54,510
GENERAL KELLY       KELLY AND HS

135
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:54,543
GENERAL KELLY       KELLY AND HR

136
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:54,577
GENERAL KELLY       KELLY AND HI

137
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:54,610
GENERAL KELLY       KELLY AND HE

138
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:54,644
GENERAL KELLY       KELLY AND HT

139
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:55,177
GENERAL KELLY       KELLY AND HO

140
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:55,611
OUR COUNTRY.

141
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,412
I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND JUST

142
00:03:56,412 --> 00:03:59,181
SAY THAT THE FIRST SIX MONTHS WE

143
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:00,650
HAD A DISRUPTER COMING INTO THIS

144
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,151
WHITE HOUSE WHO HADN'T SERVED IN

145
00:04:02,151 --> 00:04:02,618
POLITICS BEFORE.

146
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,954
HE WASN'T A POLITICIAN.

147
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:06,322
HE BROUGHT IN A TEAM THAT REALLY

148
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:08,891
WAS ABLE TO SHAKE THINGS UP AND

149
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,693
WE HAD SOME BUMPY ROADS BUT WE

150
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:11,994
DID A LOT TO SUCCEED FOR THIS

151
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:12,795
PRESIDENT AND HIS AGENDA.

152
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:13,996
I'M PROUD OF THE WORK THAT WE

153
00:04:13,996 --> 00:04:15,464
DID OVER THOSE SIX MONTHS AND I

154
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:16,399
THINK EVERYBODY IN THE

155
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,233
WHITE HOUSE SHOULD STOP WORRYING

156
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,668
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST

157
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:20,469
AND FOCUS ON THE FUTURE AND WHAT

158
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,202
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING TO KEEP

159
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:22,805
OUR COUNTRY SAFE AND MAKE

160
00:04:22,805 --> 00:04:23,906
EVERYONE LIVE A BETTER,

161
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,341
HEALTHIER AND MORE PROSPEROUS

162
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:25,641
LIFE.

163
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,076
>> Martha: WITH REGARD TO THE

164
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:29,245
CHIEF OF STAFF, GENERAL KELLY,

165
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,746
HE'S OFF ON THE SUBJECT OF

166
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,415
LEAKS, ABOUT THINGS HE SAID AND

167
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:34,350
THEN HE HAS TO APOLOGIZE FOR

168
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:34,750
THEM.

169
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,385
WHO IS AFTER HIM IN THE

170
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:36,786
WHITE HOUSE?

171
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:40,956
WHO IS PUTTING THIS OUT THERE?

172
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,992
>> I WILL TELL YOU THIS, I

173
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,160
GENERALLY -- I WOULDN'T WANT TO

174
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,195
CROSS A MARINE, NEVER MIND A

175
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:46,696
FOUR STAR REMAIN.

176
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:47,596
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S GOT THE GUTS

177
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,031
TO DO THAT BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT

178
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,266
A SMART MOVE BECAUSE THEY THINK

179
00:04:50,266 --> 00:04:51,367
OF GENERAL KELLY FOUND OUT THEY

180
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,668
WOULD LAST ABOUT TWO SECONDS OF

181
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,804
THE WHITE HOUSE.

182
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:55,971
I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING

183
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:56,872
PEOPLE WHO WEEK ARE PEOPLE WHO

184
00:04:56,872 --> 00:05:01,444
ARE LOSING AN ARGUMENT OR WANT

185
00:05:01,444 --> 00:05:02,945
TO UNDERMINE THE PERSON THAT'S

186
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:03,612
WINNING THE ARGUMENT OR

187
00:05:03,612 --> 00:05:05,347
UNDERMINE THEIR AUTHORITY SO I

188
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,549
THINK GENERAL KELLY WAS BROUGHT

189
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:07,750
IN TO BRING SOME DISCIPLINE AND

190
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,453
ORDER TO A WHITE HOUSE AND I

191
00:05:10,453 --> 00:05:11,287
THINK PEOPLE WHO ARE UNHAPPY

192
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:12,555
WITH THE PROCESS THAT HE HAS

193
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:13,289
LAID OUT ARE PROBABLY TRYING TO

194
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,957
UNDERMINE THAT.

195
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:16,659
>> Martha: DO YOU HOPE HE

196
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:19,161
STAYS?

197
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,963
>> I HOPE THAT IF THAT'S WHAT

198
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:22,331
THE PRESIDENT WANTS, BUT I THINK

199
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,065
ULTIMATELY I WANT THE PRESIDENT

200
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:26,368
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA TO

201
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:26,702
SUCCEED.

202
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,570
I THINK GENERAL KELLY HAS DONE A

203
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,472
GREAT JOB AS CHIEF OF STAFF AND

204
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:30,406
IF YOU DO PRESIDENT AND HE WANT

205
00:05:30,406 --> 00:05:31,774
TO KEEP GOING TOGETHER THAT'S

206
00:05:31,774 --> 00:05:32,608
GREAT.

207
00:05:32,608 --> 00:05:33,843
THEY ARE TOUGH JOBS.

208
00:05:33,843 --> 00:05:34,510
IT'S EXTREMELY INTENSE AND I

209
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,011
THINK IT'S A MUTUAL DECISION

210
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:37,179
THAT BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO HAVE

211
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:38,214
GOING FORWARD BUT AS LONG AS THE

212
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,048
PRESIDENT WANTS HIM AND HE WANTS

213
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,617
TO STAY I THINK IT'S A GREAT

214
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:42,151
COMBINATION SO FAR.

215
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,552
>> Martha: YOU BEEN WRITING A

216
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,854
BOOK ABOUT YOUR TIME, THE

217
00:05:44,854 --> 00:05:45,221
BRIEFING.

218
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:46,388
I ASKED YOU WHEN YOU WERE IN THE

219
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,556
BREAK IF YOU HAD NEED PTSD WHEN

220
00:05:47,556 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU WERE WRITING THE BOOK AND
