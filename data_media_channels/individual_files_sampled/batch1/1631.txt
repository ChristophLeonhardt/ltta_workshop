a tunnel of triangles lighting up London's dark winter nights a line of LED umbrellas weaving through the streets this is London's Lumiere festival a chance to see the city in a different light for four nights only with the capital as their canvas some of the 50 artists have transformed its iconic buildings with large scale projections Westminster Abbey with its martyrs painted in glorious Technicolor that the original architects could only have dreamed of audiences have to wrap up warm but organizers say it's a chance to tune into something other than a screen I'll show you company that I run that produces the event it's really dedicated to creating moments in people's lives that are away from screams you know whether that's a phone or a tablet or a computer or a telly with all of those things you can be anywhere you can meet anyone you like but actually it's sort of not real the free festival hopes to lure more than a million visitors at a time of year when most stay at home some of the works are interactive and addictive like this led sculpture called control no control the more playful ones like impulse give adults a chance to play in a public street like children once did Leicester Square is overrun with nocturnal animals a reminder that we share this city with others that we don't always see we tend to be very self-centered and actually we're part of a much broader picture and everything is connected artists and scientists collaborated for this piece cosmos cope a chance for viewers to contemplate our universe it's trying to be a quite a kind of holistic or total statement about the history of our understanding of the cosmos and the cosmos itself and our place importantly within it and what it means to think about the universe one's own individual existence some of the pieces do pose a question like this one water left by a Dutch artist the idea is that we are underwater after the effects of climate change and rising sea levels have taken their toll and it is eerily surreal to immerse yourself even further you can take out your phone download the soundtrack that goes with it and plug in your headphones illuminating spaces that people would normally pass by without a thought Lumia is a rare chance to see London in a new light charlie Angela al-jazeera London
