INDEPENDENCE.
THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?
ALL RIGHT.
AINSLEY?
AINSLEY: THANK YOU, STEVE.
A DESPERATE PLEA FROM THE
FAMILY OF A FALLEN MARINE
THIS MORNING AFTER SOMEONE
STOLE HIS SENTIMENTAL FLAG.
THAT FLAG WAS DRAPED OVER
LANCE CORPORAL JOE JACKSON'S
BED BEFORE HE WENT OUT ON
HIS LAST PATROL IN
AFGHANISTAN AND WAS KILLED
IN ACTION IN 2011.
THE FLAG ALSO SIGNED BY
EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF HIS
PLATOON AND TWO OF THEM HAVE
DIED.
THREE ARE AMPUTEES AND
SEVERAL OTHERS WERE HURT AND
ARE DEALING NOW WITH PTSD.
JACKSON'S FATHER AND MARINE
CORPS VETERAN SEAN MARSEAU
JOINS US NOW.
>> THANK YOU, GOOD MORNING.
AINSLEY: I KNOW EVERYONE
FIGHTING FOR OUR COUNTRY
PAYS SUCH A DEAR PRICE.
TELL US ABOUT YOUR SON JOE.
>> HE FOLLOWED IN THE LINE
OF MYSELF.
I SERVED IN THE MARINE
CORPS.
HIS GRANDPA SERVED IN '68
WITH A GREAT GRANDPA JUMPED
INTO NORMANDY:  IT'S IN HIS
BLOOD LINE.
HE WAS A STRONG MAN.
AINSLEY: ONLY 22 WHEN HE
LOST HIS LIFE FIGHTING FOR
OUR FREEDOMS.
I POSTED A STORY ON FACEBOOK
AND IT GOT OUR ATTENTION.
YOU POSTED IT ON FRIDAY AND
ON MONDAY IT WAS SHARED
40,000 TIMES.
IT WAS ABOUT THE FLAG THAT
WE MENTIONED IN THE INTRO
THAT WAS STOLEN THAT WAS
OVER YOUR SON'S BED ON HIS
LAST PATROL.
TELL US ABOUT THIS FLAG AND
WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU.
>> I USE THIS FLAG AS A
TALKING POINT TO AT LOVE
PEOPLE.
KIND OF THE ICE BREAKER WHEN
I'M TALKING TO YOUNG VETS.
THEY CAN -- SEE THAT THEY
HAVE LOST PEOPLE IN BATTLE,
TOO.
AND WHAT IT DOES IS THEY CAN
RELATE.
IT HELPS THEM OPEN UP A
LITTLE BIT.
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SIGNED
IT WERE FROM ALL
NATIONALITIES.
NO RELIGION, NO GOVERNMENT
AFFILIATION.
JUST SMALL TOWN AMERICA.
WHAT THAT FLAG, WHY IT IS SO
IMPORTANT TO US, BECAUSE IT
WAS JOE'S AND AROUND THE
GUYS THAT HE LOVED.
THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT IT
WAS.
AINSLEY: SO, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE FLAG.
>> WE HAVE A MEMORIAL -- AS
A MATTER OF FACT, WE JUST
HAD THE ANNIVERSARY OF
JOE'S -- WHEN HE WAS KILLED
SO WE HAVE A MEMORIAL EVERY
YEAR.
AND LEADING UP TO IT I WAS
LOOKING FOR HIS FLAG -- MY
CAR WAS BROKEN INTO BEFORE
THAT, I THOUGHT I BROUGHT IT
INTO THE HOUSE.
THEN WE LOOKED INTO --
STARTED BECOMING -- MEMORIAL
WAS COMING UP AND I STARTED
TO FRANTICALLY LOOKING AND I
COULDN'T FIND IT I TOLD MY
LIFE.
SO WE WENT THROUGH THE
MEMORIAL AFTER THAT.  I KEPT
LOOKING AND I SAID OH, NO.
IT WAS IN THE TRUCK.
BECAUSE THAT DAY WE WERE
GOING TO -- I ACTUALLY WAS
GOING TO TAKE IT OUT TO GET
FRAMED.
I WAS SHOWING ANOTHER VET.
AND IT GOT, I BELIEVE IT GOT
STOLEN.
IT MUST HAVE USED IT TO BAG
THEIR STUFF UP THAT'S HOW WE
LOST IT.
AINSLEY: SEAN, WHEN YOU
REALIZED THAT, I'M SURE YOUR
HEART SANK.
WHAT WERE YOUR EMOTIONS?
>> FIRST OFF, I WAS VERY
UPSET.
I MEAN A RAGE.
AND THEN DISAPPOINTMENT
BECAUSE I LOST IT AND THEN
JUST A LAST DITCH EFFORT.
FRIDAY WAS A LAST DITCH
EFFORT.
IT WAS JUST, PLEASE.
AINSLEY: TELL US THE AREA
WHERE YOU LIVE AND HOW WE
CAN HELP AS VIEWERS.
>> WELL, I LIVE IN
WASHINGTON.
CENTRAL WASHINGTON OR THE
ACUMANDA RESERVATION.
THAT'S WHY I SAID JUST
SHARE.
IF YOU CAN SHARE AND IT
BRING IT OUT TO YOUR LOCAL
POLICE DEPARTMENT NEWS
STATION, NEWSPAPER, HOWEVER
YOU CAN DO IT.
JUST HAVE SOMEBODY TURN IT
IN.
LOOK IN PAWN STORES.
LOOK IN GOODWILLS, WHATEVER.
WHATEVER SECOND HAND STORE
YOU HAVE THAT MIGHT BE
THERE.
I KNOW IT'S A LAST DITCH
EFFORT BUT IT MEANS
EVERYTHING TO US.
IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO THE
17 THAT WERE KILLED IN THAT
DEPLOYMENT.
IT MEANS EVERYTHING TO ALL
THOSE 190 THAT WERE WOUNDED
AT THAT TIME.
IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT ME IT
TOUCH AS LOT OF PEOPLE.
MY FAMILY AND MARINES THAT
SERVED WITH JOE.
THEY WOULD LIKE IT BACK.
AINSLEY: SEAN, JOE'S STORY
IS TOUCHING TO ALL OF US,
UNFORTUNATELY HIS LIFE WAS
CUT SHORT AT 22 YEARS OLD.
WHAT DOES HIS SERVICE MEAN
TO YOU?
>> SACRIFICE.
HE IS BURIED HONORABLY AS A
MARINE.
HE WAS WHERE HE WANTED TO
BE.
HE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE
LOVED ONES THAT HE WANTED TO
BE AROUND.
AND WHEN HE DIED, HE WAS
CARRIED BY THE METROPOLITAN
THAT LOVED HIM.
AND SO I THINK HIS SERVICE
SHOWS THE LOVE WE HAVE YOU
KNOW, THE GUY TO YOUR LEFT,
THE GUY TO YOUR RIGHT,.
AINSLEY: A BEAUTIFUL
