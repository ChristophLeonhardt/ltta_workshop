2
00:00:02,735 --> 00:00:04,204
>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE 

3
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,071
WHITE HOUSE WHERE PRESIDENT 

4
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,207
TRUMP AND THE PRIME MINISTER OF 

5
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,675
ITALY ARE HOLDING A JOINT PRESS 

6
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:09,843
CONFERENCE. 

7
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,277
BOTH HAVE BEEN IN SUPPORT OF 

8
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:20,320
IMPROVING TIES WITH RUSSIA. 

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,054
>> IN YOUR ELECTION THE ITALIAN 

10
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,222
NATION HAS REAFFIRMED 

11
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,589
SOVEREIGNTY, LAW AND 

12
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:24,190
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT STRETCHES 

13
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,791
ALL THE WAY BACK TO ANCIENT 

14
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,161
ROME. 

15
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,695
THIS PROUD HERITAGE SUSTAINS 

16
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:32,966
CIVILIZATION AND IT MUST BE 

17
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,368
ALWAYS DEFENDED. 

18
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:39,272
TODAY PRIME MINISTER CAN'T SAY 

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,107
AND I ARE PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE A 

20
00:00:41,107 --> 00:00:42,142
NEW DIALOGUE BETWEEN ITALY AND 

21
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,776
THE UNITED STATES. 

22
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,413
THAT WILL ENHANCE COOPERATION 

23
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:55,688
ON A RANGE OF ISSUES. 

24
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:56,589
THIS INCLUDES JOINT SECURITY 

25
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,390
EFFORTS IN THE MEDITERRANEAN 

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,524
WHERE WE RECOGNIZE ITALY'S 

27
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:01,661
LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE 

28
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:02,896
STABILIZATION OF LIBYA AND 

29
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,032
NORTH AFRICA. 

30
00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:07,233
BOTH THE PRIME MINISTER AND I 

31
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,168
ARE FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO 

32
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:13,973
PROTECT OUR NATION'S FROM 

33
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:15,341
UNCONTROLLED MIGRATION. 

34
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:21,047
OUR COUNTRIES HAVE LEARNED THAT 

35
00:01:21,047 --> 00:01:22,048
BORDER SECURITY IS NATIONAL 

36
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,616
SECURITY AND THEY ARE ONE IN 

37
00:01:23,616 --> 00:01:25,652
THE SAME. 

38
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,053
LIKE THE UNITED STATES ITALY IS 

39
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:27,854
CURRENTLY UNDER ENORMOUS STRAIN 

40
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,788
AS A RESULT OF ILLEGAL 

41
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:29,121
IMMIGRATION. 

42
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:33,226
THEY HAVE FOUGHT IT HARD. 

43
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,593
THE PRIME MINISTER IS WITH US 

44
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:36,495
TODAY BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL 

45
00:01:36,495 --> 00:01:39,732
IMMIGRATION. 

46
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,202
ITALY GOT TIRED OF IT. 

47
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,505
THEY DID NOT WANT IT ANY LONGER.

48
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:46,840
THE PEOPLE OF ITALY HAVE BORNE 

49
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,574
A GREAT PART OF THE BURDEN FOR 

50
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:50,176
EUROPE THROUGH THE COURSE OF 

51
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:51,878
THE MIGRATION CRISIS. 

52
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:52,712
I APPLAUD THE PRIME MINISTER 

53
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:56,082
FOR HIS BOLD LEADERSHIP, TRULY 

54
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:56,315
BOLD. 

55
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,551
I HOPE THAT MORE LEADERS WILL 

56
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,885
FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE INCLUDING 

57
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,856
LEADERS OF EUROPE. 

58
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:03,723
THE PRIME MINISTER AND I ARE 

59
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,857
UNITED IN OUR CONVICTION THAT 

60
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,727
STRONG NATIONS MUST HAVE A 

61
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,229
STRONG BORDERS. 

62
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,098
WE HAVE A SOLEMN OBLIGATION TO 

63
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:18,004
PROTECT OUR CITIZENS AND THEIR 

64
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:18,805
QUALITY OF LIFE. 

65
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,706
MY ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING 

66
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,473
HARD TO PASS BORDER SECURITY 

67
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,174
LEGISLATION, IMPROVE VETTING 

68
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,843
AND ESTABLISH A MERIT BASED 

69
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,879
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHICH THE 

70
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,386
UNITED STATES NEEDS VERY BADLY. 

71
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,055
AS FAR AS THE BORDER IS 

72
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:38,057
CONCERNED AND PERSONALLY. 

73
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:39,925
IF WE DO NOT GET BORDER SECURITY

74
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:43,696
, AFTER MANY YEARS OF TALK 

75
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:45,098
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, I 

76
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,533
WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM DOING A 

77
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,936
SHUTDOWN. 

78
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,471
IT IS TIME WE HAVE PROPER 

79
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,773
BORDER SECURITY. 

80
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,608
WE ARE THE LAUGHING STOCK OF 

81
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:57,644
THE WORLD, WE HAVE THE WORST 

82
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,012
IMMIGRATION LAWS ANYWHERE IN 

83
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:04,050
THE WORLD. 

84
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,184
IN OUR MEETING TODAY THE PRIME 

85
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,286
MINISTER AND I DISCUSSED WAYS 

86
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,420
TO ENHANCE OUR COOPERATION IN 

87
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,557
THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM. 

88
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,793
THAT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH BORDER 

89
00:03:13,793 --> 00:03:14,527
SECURITY. 

90
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,528
I WANT TO THANK THE ITALIAN 

91
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:16,329
PEOPLE FOR ITALY'S 

92
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,297

93
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:21,434
COUNTERTERRORISM AND OPERATIONS 

94
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,570
IN THE COALITION TO DEFEAT ISIS 

95
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,905
WHERE WE HAVE HAD A TREMENDOUS 

96
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:29,842
SUCCESS AND IN NATO'S RESOLUTE 

97
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,780

THE PRIME MINISTER AND I AGREE 

99
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,783
THAT THE BRUTAL REGIME IN IRAN 

100
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,784
MUST NEVER BE ALLOWED TO 

101
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,119
POSSESS A NUCLEAR WEAPON. 

102
00:03:40,119 --> 00:03:40,420
NEVER. 

103
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,754
WE ENCOURAGE ALL NATIONS TO 

104
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,757
PRESSURE IRAN TO END THE FULL 

105
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:49,062
RANGE OF THE MALIGN ACTIVITIES. 

106
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,630
THE UNITED STATES WELCOMES THE 

107
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,265
PARTNERSHIP OF ITALY IN THESE 

108
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,268
VITAL EFFORTS. 

109
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,201
TODAY WE ARE ALSO ADDRESSING 

110
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:58,404
THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF TRADE AND 

111
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:02,442
COMMERCE. 

112

WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR

116
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:13,219
A FEW DAYS AGO I MET WITH THE 

117
00:04:13,219 --> 00:04:14,353

ECONOMIES. 

150
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,150
THEY ARE BRUTAL. 

151
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,252

IN THIS AREA LIKE SO MANY OTHERS

159
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,740
COOPERATION BETWEEN ITALY AND

161
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,010
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE, NOT ONLY 

162
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,778

168
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,889
WE ALSO HAVE TO BE FAIR TO THE 

169
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,257
PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND 

170
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,525
THE TAXPAYERS OF THE UNITED 

171
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,093

175
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,433
WE ARE BOTH OUTSIDERS TO 

176
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,401

177
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,836
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? 

178
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,038
WE ARE OUTSIDERS. 

179
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,572

00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:33,626

191
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,828
WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU 

192
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,029
VERY MUCH FOR COMING TO THE 

193
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:37,362
WHITE HOUSE. 

194
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:44,337
IT IS MY GREAT HONOR. 

195
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:49,208
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. I WISH TO 

196
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:50,810
THANK YOU PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR

198
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:59,018
MONTHS AFTER THE FORMATION OF 

199
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,020
MY GOVERNMENT. 

200
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:08,928
I TAKE IT AS A SIGN OF SPECIAL 

201
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,562
ATTENTION TO ITALY AND TO ME AS 

202
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:11,764
WELL. 

203
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,032
FORGIVE ME, I DO NOT WANT TO 

204
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:18,037
RENOUNCE THE PRIVILEGE FOR 

205
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:19,171
SPEAKING IN MY WONDERFUL 

206
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:27,813
LANGUAGE. 

207
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:43,362
>> [Italian being spoken]

208
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:48,367
>> I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY AND 

209
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:49,902
AFFECTIONATE HELLO TO ALL OF

00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:53,172
THE FRIENDS. OUR RELATIONSHIP 

211
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,006
IS A VERY LONG ONE. 

212
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,274
IT GOES WAY BACK. 

213
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,077
TODAY WE HAVE STRENGTHENED IT 

214
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,079
EVEN MORE AND I AM EXTREMELY 

215
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,681
HAPPY ABOUT THIS. 

216
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,749
WITH THIS VERY FRUITFUL 

217
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:05,785
ENCOUNTER HERE AT THE WHITE 

218
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:09,722
HOUSE WE HAVE MADE ANOTHER STEP 

219
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:13,359
AHEAD. IN ORDER TO INTENSIFY 

220
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:17,163
OUR COOPERATION, OUR WORK 

221
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,831
TOGETHER TO MAKE IT MORE 

222
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,267
ADEQUATE, VIS-C-VIS THE 

223
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,668
GEOPOLITICAL ECONOMIC SITUATION 

224
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,271
IN THE WORLD. 

225
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,706
FROM JUNE 1 THERE IS ANOTHER 

226
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,174
ELEMENT THAT BRINGS US EVEN 

227
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:32,144
CLOSER, THE UNITED STATES AND 

228
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:35,414
ITALY, MY GOVERNMENT, AND THE 

229
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:36,148
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ARE BOTH 

230
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,217
GOVERNMENTS THAT REPRESENT 

231
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:38,918
CHANGE. 

232
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,152
THEY WERE CHOSEN BY CITIZENS IN 

233
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,288
ORDER TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO 

234
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,190
AND TO IMPROVE THEIR LIFE 

235
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,625
CONDITIONS. 

236
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,626
THERE IS SO MANY THINGS THAT 

237
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:47,860
BRING US TOGETHER, THAT UNIFY 

238
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,996
US IN ITALY AS IN THE UNITED 

239
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:53,332
STATES, WE ARE DOING WHAT WE 

240
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,968
HAD PROMISED DOING OUR 

241
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,235
ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN AND WE ARE 

242
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:00,640
WORKING TO GET ANSWERS TO THE 

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,675
EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CITIZENS SO 

244
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,243
THAT WE WILL NOT DISAPPOINT 

245
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:06,745
THEM AND WE DO NOT BETRAY OUR 

246
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:10,916
MANDATE. 

247
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:11,851
IN THE ITALY AND THE UNITED 

248
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,619
STATES WE ARE PROVING THAT 

249
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,087
CHANGE IS POSSIBLE. 

250
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:15,921
DONALD AND I HAVE CONCENTRATED 

251
00:09:15,921 --> 00:09:18,724
ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS. 

252
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:19,959
WE BOTH HAVE AGREED UPON AND 

253
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:20,760
REACHED THE FOLLOWING RESULTS 

254
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,861
WHICH IN PART WERE ALREADY 

255
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:27,833
MENTIONED TODAY. 

256
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,535
WE WILL HAVE MADE A GREAT STEP 

257
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,103
AHEAD. 

258
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,706
WE WILL START WORKING IN ITALY. 

259
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:37,176
IT IS A DIRECTORSHIP BOOST IN 

260
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,011
THE MEDITERRANEAN BETWEEN ITALY 

261
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,847
AND THE UNITED STATES. 

262
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:43,949
I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE ALMOST 

263
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:45,551
TWIN COUNTRIES IN WHICH ITALY 

264
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:48,754
IS BECOMING A REFERENCE POINT IN

265
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,724
EUROPE AND A PRIVILEGE -- FOR 

266
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:55,294
THE UNITED STATES FOR THE MAIN 

267
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,295
THREATS AND CHALLENGES THAT WE 

268
00:09:56,295 --> 00:09:57,830
HAVE FOR US. 

269
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:01,667
TERRORISM AND FOR ALL THE 

270
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:03,436
CRISES THAT WE SEE IN THE 

271
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,103
MEDITERRANEAN AND IN PARTICULAR 

272
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,704
WITH REGARDS TO LIBYA. 

273
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:08,874
SECONDLY, THE AMERICAN 

274
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,210
ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT 

275
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,079
LIBERTY -- ITALY HAS A 

276
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:16,482
LEADERSHIP ROLE AS A PROMOTER 

277
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:17,650
COUNTRY THAT WILL LEAD TO THE 

278
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,818
STABILIZATION OF LIBYA. 

279
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:23,389
OF COURSE THIS IS WITH GREAT 

280
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,792
RESPECT TO THE LIBYAN POPULATION

281
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,060
WITH THE UNITED STATES WE WILL 

282
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,428
BE WORKING IN ORDER TO REACH 

283
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:29,828
THESE RESULTS. 

284
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:31,463
WE WILL DECIDE WHAT NEEDS TO BE 

285
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:36,135
DONE IN LIEU OF THIS RESULT. 

286
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,503
I AM TRULY THANKFUL TO YOU 

287
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,637
DONALD FOR YOUR SUPPORT. 

288
00:10:38,637 --> 00:10:41,207
THIRDLY, IN TERMS OF 

289
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:41,607
IMMIGRATION. 

290
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:45,544
I ALSO DESCRIBED TWO PRESIDENT 

291
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,978
TRUMP, THE INNOVATIVE APPROACH 

292
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:52,251
THAT ITALY HAS PUT FORTH AND 

293
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:53,585
THE EUROPEAN UNION NOW HAS A 

294
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:56,956
RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT LEAVE THE 

295
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,191
WEIGHT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF 

296
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,693
IMMIGRATION ON THE SHOULDERS OF 

297
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,229
THE COUNTRIES OF FIRST ARRIVAL 

298
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:03,829
LIKE ITALY IS. 

299
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,631
AND AS YOU HEARD RESIDENT TRUMP 

300
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,666
SAY WE APPRECIATE THIS 

301
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:09,635
CONTRIBUTION WHICH IS PROVIDED 

302
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,370
BY THE ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WHICH 

303
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,606
IS PROVIDING GOOD RESULTS. 

304
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,041
WE ARE TALKING A MULTILEVEL 

305
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,777
APPROACH IN ORDER TO TRY TO 

306
00:11:18,777 --> 00:11:21,213
RESOLVE THE PHENOMENON OF 

307
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,949
IMMIGRATION. 

308
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,284
NOT BECAUSE OF AN EMERGENCY BUT 

309
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,452
BECAUSE OF A STRUCTURAL 

310
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,521
APPROACH. 

311
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,356
I WANT TO UNDERLINE THIS IS IN 

312
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,724
MIND WITH THE POSITION OF 

313
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:37,663
PRESIDENT TRUMP WHICH GOES FROM 

314
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:38,764
THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY OF 

315
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:39,698
PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT 

316
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:40,198
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS ARE 

317
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,567
PROTECTED AND MAKE SURE THAT 

318
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:47,072
RIGHTS ARE TRAMPLED OVER 

319
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:48,140
BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE IN THE 

320
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,008
HANDS OF CRIMINAL --. 

321
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:52,044
I ALSO WANT TO UNDERLINE THAT 

322
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,514
THE WORLD DAY FOR THE EXCHANGE 

323
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,285
OF HUMAN BEINGS IS GOING TO BE 

324
00:11:59,285 --> 00:11:59,585
CELEBRATED. 

325
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:02,254
I ALSO TOLD PRESIDENT TRUMP 

326
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,889
THAT I AM SATISFIED FOR THE 

327
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:09,061
UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS REACHED 

328
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:09,795
RECENTLY BETWEEN OURSELVES AND 

329
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,097
THE PRESIDENTS OF THE EUROPEAN 

330
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:11,397
COMMISSION. 

331
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,631
I BELIEVE THAT THIS 

332
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:15,134
UNDERSTANDING IS FUNDAMENTAL. 

333
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,701
WE HAVE TO WORK UPON IT 

334
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:18,170
IMMEDIATELY BRINGING OUR 

335
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,639
EFFORTS TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE 

336
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,407
EUROPEAN-AMERICAN, ITALIAN 

337
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:25,478
CITIZENS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS 

338
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:27,446
OF A MORE EQUITABLE TRADE 

339
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,415
RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS 

340
00:12:30,415 --> 00:12:34,353
COMPLETELY RECIPROCAL. 

341
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,988
ONCE AGAIN, AS FAR AS RUSSIA IS 

342
00:12:35,988 --> 00:12:39,425
CONCERNED, ITALY IS FAVORABLE 

343
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:44,163
TO A DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA. 

344
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:44,797
ITALY ALSO CONSIDERS THE 

345
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:45,764
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE UNITED 

346
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,967
STATES AND RUSSIA IS FUNDAMENTAL

347
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,804
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE POSITIVE 

348
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,006
RESULTS IN A MORE GLOBAL 

349
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,040
PERSPECTIVE FOR STABILITY AND 

350
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,078
SECURITY PURPOSES. 

351
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:02,648
IN TERMS OF ENERGY SECURITY. 

352
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:03,349
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND I ALSO 

353
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,017
FOUND OURSELVES IN AGREEMENT 

354
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:07,520
WITH THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

355
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,421
THERE IS A GREATER 

356
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,291
DIVERSIFICATION FOR THE SOURCES 

357
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:18,097
OF ENERGY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT 

358
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,031
THE ENERGY ROOTS ARE 

359
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:19,898
DIVERSIFIED AS WELL. 

360
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:25,905
FINALLY I AM SURE THAT WE CAN 

361
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,505
INCREASE AND IMPROVE THE 

362
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,439
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED 

363
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,974
STATES AT ALL LEVELS AND IN 

364
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:32,845
PARTICULAR THE SPACE AND 

365
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,314
AEROSPACE FIELDS. 

366
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,017
WE ALREADY HAVE A GREAT 

367
00:13:38,017 --> 00:13:39,852
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ITALIAN 

368
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,987
SPACE AGENCY AND NASA. 

369
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,925
WE HOPE THAT AEROSPACE WILL 

370
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:46,892
BRING TOGETHER AMERICAN 

371
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,094
TECHNOLOGY, ITALIAN TECHNOLOGY 

372
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,929
SO THAT WE CAN LAUNCH NEW 

373
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,965
AIRCRAFT THAT CROSS THE 

374
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:57,503
ATMOSPHERE AND WILL BE ABLE TO 

375
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,438
BRING THE UNITED STATES AND 

376
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:00,639
ITALY TOGETHER. 

377
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,442
THIS IS A PROJECT THAT I WOULD 

378
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,846
LIKE TO SPEAK IN DETAIL WITH 

379
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:08,447
THE AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION. 

380
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:15,821
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. 

381
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:21,727
>>THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

382
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:24,630
TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT YOU ARE 

383
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,900
SAYING ABOUT THE SHUTDOWN, ARE 

384
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,401
YOU WILLING TO SHUT THE 

385
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,068
GOVERNMENT DOWN IN SEPTEMBER IF 

386
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:31,303
IT DOES NOT FULLY FUND $25 

387
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,706
BILLION WORTH OF YOUR BORDER 

388
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,774
WALL AND ALSO DELIVER THE 

389
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,508
IMMIGRATION PRIORITIES THAT YOU 

390
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,677
LISTED IN YOUR TWEET? 

391
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,645
OR ARE YOU LEAVING SOME ROOM 

392
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,612
FOR NEGOTIATION? 

393
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,514
>>I ALWAYS LEAVE ROOM FOR 

394
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,750
NEGOTIATION. 

395
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,751
THIS HAS BEEN MANY YEARS NOT 

396
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,253
JUST THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

397
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,055
THIS HAS BEEN MANY YEARS AND 

398
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,590
EVEN DECADES, WE HAVE 

399
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,225
IMMIGRATION LAWS, WE HAVE 

400
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,728
BORDER SECURITY, ALL SORTS OF 

401
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,329
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON. 

402
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,932
WE ARE DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB 

403
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:03,702
RESCINDING RECORDS BUT WE ARE 

404
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,937
WORKING AROUND THE LAWS. 

405
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,506
I HAVE TO TAKE MY HAT OFF TO 

406
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:10,809
THE BORDER PATROL, TO LAW 

407
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,544
ENFORCEMENT, TO ICE WHICH HAS 

408
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:17,348
BEEN MALIGNED BY THE DEMOCRATS. 

409
00:15:17,348 --> 00:15:21,120
THEY GO INTO THESE MS 13 NESTS. 

410
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,555
NEST OF BAD PEOPLE, KILLERS IN 

411
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:29,962
MANY PLACES THEY ARE FEARLESS 

412
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,330
AND THEY DO AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 

413
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,765
THEY EITHER GO TO JAIL OR THEY 

414
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,866
GET THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 

415
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,068
I WANT TO TIP MY HAT TO ICE AND 

416
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,569
THOSE BRAVE PEOPLE. 

417
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:39,838
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY. 

418
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,408
WITHOUT A BORDER AS THIS 

419
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,143
GENTLEMAN CAN TELL YOU ALSO, 

420
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,644
THE PRIME MINISTER WAS A BIG 

421
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:53,485
FACTOR IN HIS WIN IN ITALY. 

422
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:54,119
WE NEED BORDER SECURITY. 

423
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,020
THAT INCLUDES THE WALL. 

424
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,823
WE HAVE TO TO END THE LOTTERY. 

425
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:01,527
WE HAVE TO END THE CHAIN. 

426
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:05,097
THE CHAIN IS A DISASTER. 

427
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:06,498
YOU BRING ONE PERSON IN AND YOU 

428
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,533
END UP WITH 32 PEOPLE. 

429
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,269
WE HAVE TO END THESE HORRIBLE 

430
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,371
CATCH AND RELEASE PRINCIPLES 

431
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:15,107
WERE YOU CATCH SOMEBODY, YOU 

432
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,808
TAKE THEIR NAME AND YOU RELEASE 

433
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,844
THEM. 

434
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,245
THEN THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO COME 

435
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,513
BACK TO A COURT CASE WHERE THEY 

436
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,083
WANT US TO HIRE THOUSANDS OF 

437
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:24,316
JUDGES. 

438
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,386
THE WHOLE THING IS RIDICULOUS. 

439
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,856
WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR LAWS. 

440
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:32,257
I WOULD BE WILLING TO CLOSE IT 

441
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,159
DOWN TO GET IT DONE. 

442
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,962
WE ARE APPROVING THINGS IN 

443
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:37,795
VARIOUS OF BILLS. 

444
00:16:37,795 --> 00:16:42,768
INCLUDING THE MILITARY. 

445
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,802
WE ALWAYS PUT THE MILITARY AND 

446
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:45,337
LAW ENFORCEMENT VERY HIGH. 

447
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,005
I AM WILLING TO CONSIDER A 

448
00:16:47,005 --> 00:16:50,642
SHUTDOWN IF WE DO NOT GET 

449
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,542
PROPER BORDER SECURITY. 

450
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:55,347
>> IS THE $25 BILLION THE 

451
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,381
REDLINE FOR YOU? 

452
00:16:56,381 --> 00:17:00,519
>>I HAVE NO REDLINE UNLIKE 

453
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,587
PRESIDENT OBAMA. 

454
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:09,961
I JUST WANT BETTER BORDER 

455
00:17:09,961 --> 00:17:10,395
SECURITY. 

456
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:11,597
>> MR. PRIME MINISTER, HERE IN 

457
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,731
THE UNITED STATES THERE WAS A 

458
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:13,432
CONSENSUS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

459
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,099
APPEARANCE AT THE G7 AND NATO 

460
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,702
DAMAGED OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 

461
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,135
THOSE INSTITUTIONS. 

462
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,470
AS A MEMBER OF BOTH OF THOSE 

463
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,905
INSTITUTIONS WHAT IS YOUR 

464
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:21,373
OPINION ON THE PRESIDENT 

465
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:31,283
APPEARANCE AT BOTH? 

466
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:36,989
>> BOTH AT THE G7 AND AT NATO, 

467
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,224
WE HAD A VERY FRUITFUL EXCHANGE 

468
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,294
OF VIEWS AND OPINIONS AND 

469
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,096
POSITIONS. 

470
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:47,065
I THINK THAT ALL THE POSITIONS 

471
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:51,637
AND STANCES THAT ARE EXPRESSED 

472
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:56,375
WITH CLARITY AND PROVIDE -- TO 

473
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,042
VIEW WELL-ESTABLISHED POSITIONS 

474
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:57,376
ARE WELCOME. 

475
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:01,346
THERE WAS A FRUITFUL EXCHANGE 

476
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:02,781
BOTH AT THE G7 SUMMIT AND AT 

477
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,116
THE NATO SUMMIT IN DIFFERENT 

478
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:07,152
FRAMEWORKS. 

479
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,153
WE FOR INSTANCE IN THE 

480
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:09,488
FRAMEWORK OF THE G7 SUMMIT, WE 

481
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:12,991
AGREED ON THE NEED FOR REFORMING

482
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:16,328
THE SYSTEM. 

483
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:21,567
IT IS A YEAR OLD SYSTEM WHICH 

484
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,034
CONSIDER CHINA AS AN EMERGING 

485
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,069
COUNTRY. 

486
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,638
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT AND 

487
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:28,407
APPLYING THE SAME RULES WITH 

488
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:32,811
YEARS AND PRIVILEGES GRANTED TO 

489
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,845
THE COUNTRY CLEARLY MEANS THAT 

490
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,614
HAVING A SYSTEM THAT IS NOT 

491
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,915
WELL-FUNCTIONING AND NOT WELL 

492
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,751
RATIONAL. 

493
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:44,089
-- WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP I 

494
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:48,093
PERSONALLY SHARE FAIRLY, HE 

495
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:49,294
EXPRESSED A POSITION AND A NEED 

496
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,763
TO REBALANCE THE EXPENDITURE 

497
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:57,236
WHICH IS BORN -- IN THE UNITED 

498
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,503
STATES WHICH IS RARELY 

499
00:18:58,503 --> 00:18:59,037
DISPROPORTIONATE. 

500
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,038
THESE ARE REASONABLE POSITIONS 

501
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:03,709
AND STANCES AND I PERSONALLY 

502
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:10,849
THINK THAT'S MY TAKE THAT INTO 

503
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,184
ACCOUNT AND I WILL BE THE 

504
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,452
CARRIER OF THE MESSAGE TO TRY 

505
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:14,319
TO MAKE THE OTHERS UNDERSTAND 

506
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:14,820
THESE POSITIONS. 

507
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,721
WE MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE 

508
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:16,922
UNITED STATES TO FIND THE 

509
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,290
BALANCE IN THE INTEREST OF 

510
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,391
ITALIAN CITIZENS, AMERICAN 

511
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,725
CITIZENS AND EUROPEAN CITIZENS. 

512
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:24,830
>>I ALSO WANT TO ADD TO THAT, I 

513
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,265
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU 

514
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:27,733
SAID, IT HAS BEEN VERY UNFAIR 

515
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,034
IN UNITED STATES. 

516
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:31,103
WE HAD A VERY GOOD G7 MEETING, 

517
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,473
THAT IS WHERE WE BECAME 

518
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:34,773
FRIENDS. 

519
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:35,908
I THINK WE WERE MORE CLOSELY 

520
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,342
ALIGNED THAN ANYBODY ELSE IN 

521
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,010
THE ROOM. 

522
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,313
IT WAS A GREAT MEETING IN EVERY 

523
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:41,580
RESPECT. 

524
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,715
NTO, IN PARTICULAR. 

525
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:48,020
I WENT TO NATO, NATO WAS 

526
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,154
ESSENTIALLY GOING OUT OF 

527
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,155
BUSINESS BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE 

528
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,056
NOT PAYING AND IT WAS GOING 

529
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:51,256
DOWN. 

530
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:55,727
I CAME ALONG LAST YEAR AND IN A 

531
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,728
FAIRLY NICE TONE I SAID YOU 

532
00:19:56,728 --> 00:19:57,663
HAVE GOT TO PAY. 

533
00:19:57,663 --> 00:20:00,799
THEY PAID $44 BILLION MORE. 

534
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,401
THIS YEAR I SAID IT IN A 

535
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,869
STRONGER TONE AND THEY ARE 

536
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,269
PAYING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF 

537
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:07,472
DOLLARS MORE. 

538
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:11,143
NATO WILL BE STRONG AGAIN. 

539
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,877
IF YOU SPEAK TO THE SECRETARY 

540
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:15,814
GENERAL, I THINK HE IS THE 

541
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:16,915
BIGGEST FAN OF TRUMP. 

542
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,349
HE SAID WE COULD NOT COLLECT 

543
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:20,152
MONEY UNTIL PRESIDENT TRUMP 

544
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,354
CAME ALONG. 

545
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,189
HE SAID LAST YEAR WE COLLECTED 

546
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,991
$44 BILLION. THIS YEAR THE 

547
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:27,826
MONEY IS POURING IN. 

548
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:29,360
IT IS LIKE THE PRIME MINISTER 

549
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,298
SAID, TALK ABOUT IMBALANCE, WE 

550
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,633
WERE TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY. 

551
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:36,001
UNITED STATES WAS TREATED VERY 

552
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,071
UNFAIRLY BECAUSE WE ARE 

553
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,575
SHOULDERING ANYWHERE FROM 80 TO 

554
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:50,148
90 PERCENT OF THE COST OF NATO. 

555
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,049
THAT IS NOT FAIR. 

556
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:51,983
WHEN YOU TAKE GERMANY, THEY ARE 

557
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,318
PAYING A LITTLE MORE THAN 1 

558
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,653
PERCENT AND THEY ARE BUYING AND 

559
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,686
PAYING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS TO 

560
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,389
RUSSIA. WE ARE SUPPOSED TO 

561
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,590
PROTECT COUNTRIES FROM RUSSIA, 

562
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,826
BUT THEY ARE PAYING RUSSIA 

563
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:02,661
BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

564
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:07,165
FOR THE ENERGY. 

565
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:07,632
NOT A GOOD SITUATION. 

566
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:11,002
I LET IT BE KNOWN. 

567
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:11,737
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE NATO 

568
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,338
COUNTRIES ARE PAYING A LOT MORE 

569
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,874
MONEY AND IT HAS BECOME A LOT 

570
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:20,145
STRONGER BECAUSE OF IT. 

571
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:29,855
>>MY I ADD SOMETHING? AS A 

572
00:21:29,855 --> 00:21:31,089
PERSON WHO HAS -- AND AS A 

573
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:33,125
LAWYER, YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT 

574
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,260
WHO IS A STRONG SUPPORTER AND 

575
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,930
ADVOCATE ARE IN THE INTEREST OF 

576
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,731
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE 

577
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:40,164
AMERICAN COUNTRY. 

578
00:21:40,164 --> 00:21:45,137
HE IS A GREAT NEGOTIATOR. 

579
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:50,776
I AM TOLD THAT THERE IS A GROUP 

580
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,813
THAT WANTS TO ASK A QUESTION. 

581
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,382
>> -- THE ITALIAN ECONOMY 

582
00:21:57,382 --> 00:22:00,085
PERFORMS -- UNDERPERFORMS 

583
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:04,122
REGULARLY. 

584
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:05,123
WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD 

585
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:06,124
REIGNITE THE ITALIAN ECONOMY 

586
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:07,659
AND WHAT ROLE DO YOU THINK THE 

587
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,128
EU SHOULD PLAY IN IT AND 

588
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:16,268
PRESIDENT CONTE DO YOU THINK 

589
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,703
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S IDEA WOULD 

590
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:19,771
WORK IN ITALY? 

591
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:24,676
>> I BELIEVE THE PRIME MINISTER 

592
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,144
IS GOING TO DO A TREMENDOUS JOB 

593
00:22:26,144 --> 00:22:27,212
ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. 

594
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:27,846
IN ADDITION TO BORDERS. 

595
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,614
FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT YOU 

596
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,750
NEED BORDERS ALSO. 

597
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,151
YOU HAVE A MAN WHO IS GOING TO 

598
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,387
DO A TERRIFIC JOB. 

599
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,055
HE KNOWS HOW TO SELL AND HE 

600
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:38,890
KNOWS HOW TO PROMOTE A GREAT 

601
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,694
PRODUCT. 

602
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,929
I WILL NOT MENTION THEIR NAMES 

603
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,765
BUT THEY ARE GREAT. 

604
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,266
ITALY MAKES A GREAT PRODUCT AND 

605
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,001
I THINK IT WILL DO WELL 

606
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:50,936
ECONOMICALLY AND WE ARE THERE 

607
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:51,236
TO HELP. 

608
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,338
WE HAVE HAD RECORD NUMBERS. 

609
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,975
I HAVE BEEN MORE -- HERE FOR A 

610
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,543
LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AND A 

611
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,246
HALF AND WE HAVE HAD RECORD 

612
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:01,512
NUMBERS. 

613
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:03,014
WE HAVE NUMBERS THAT NOBODY 

614
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:03,447
BELIEVES POSSIBLE. 

615
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:05,550
ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT ONE 

616
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,685
PARTICULAR FACT THAT WAS NOT 

617
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:11,122
REPORTED MUCH, THE TRADE DEFICIT

618
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,791
$52 BILLION REDUCTION IN THE 

619
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,760
TRADE DEFICIT FOR THE QUARTER. 

620
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,531
I THINK STEVEN MNUCHIN AND MIKE 

621
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:23,835
POMPEO NOT EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE 

622
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,337
THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE 

623
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:31,309
BEEN POSSIBLE. 

624
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:32,644
>> I THINK THAT ITALY WILL DO 

625
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:33,245
THE SAME THING. 

626
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,246
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NUMBERS BUT 

627
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:34,679
THE SAME THING. 

628
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,214
>>WHAT ROLE WILL THE EUROPEAN 

629
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,985
UNION PLAY IN THE MATTER? 

630
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,820
DO YOU THINK THE EUROPEAN UNION 

631
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,555
SHOULD PLAY? 

632
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,824
>> THAT IS UP TO THEM. 

633
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:48,126
THE EUROPEAN UNION, JEAN-CLAUDE 

634
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,162
AND I HAD A FANTASTIC MEETING, 

635
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:52,464
WE WERE HAVING A HARD TIME AND 

636
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,399
AND I MENTIONED TARIFFS ON 

637
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:54,599
CARS. 

638
00:23:54,599 --> 00:24:05,644
WE GOT ALONG REALLY WELL. 

639
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:06,878
I THINK THEY WILL TREAT US 

640
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:07,178
FAIRLY. 

641
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:08,046
WE WILL TREAT THEM FAIRLY. 

642
00:24:08,046 --> 00:24:09,448
THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS TOTALLY 

643
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,215
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED 

644
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:10,448
STATES. 

645
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,917
WE CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN. 

646
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,719
BY THE WAY, ITALY HAS A $31 

647
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,087
BILLION SURPLUS WITH THE UNITED 

648
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,355
STATES. 

649
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,823
WE HAVE A $31 BILLION TRADE 

650
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:21,560
DEFICIT WITH ITALY AND WE 

651
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,561
DISCUSSED THAT. 

652
00:24:23,561 --> 00:24:35,674
WE WILL WORK SOMETHING OUT. 

653
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:42,814
>> I AM VERY ENVIOUS OF THE 

654
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:43,748
RECORDS AND THE GROWTH FIGURES 

655
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:44,583
OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. 

656
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,685
WE DISCUSSED THAT BEFORE WITH 

657
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,719
DONALD, THESE ARE SYSTEMS THAT 

658
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:51,289
CANNOT BE COMPARED BECAUSE THEY 

659
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,924
ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SO THAT 

660
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:53,525
ARE DIFFERENT. 

661
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,161
AT THE SAME TIME I AM ENVIOUS 

662
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,698
AND AMBITIOUS AT THE SAME TIME. 

663
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,632
AS A GOVERNMENT LEADER I AM 

664
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:02,133
AMBITIOUS FOR MY ECONOMY TO DO 

665
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:03,768
MUCH MORE THAN WHAT WAS DONE IN 

666
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:04,035
THE PAST. 

667
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,072
WE ARE PREPARING FORMS WHICH WE 

668
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,540
WILL BE SUBMITTING TO THE 

669
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:17,682
EUROPEAN PARTNERS. I DO NOT 

670
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,117
WANT THE TAX REFORM TO BE SET 

671
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:19,350
ASIDE. 

672
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,518
IT WAS A LEVERAGE IN THIS 

673
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,854
COUNTRY FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH AND 

674
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,957
-- IF WELL CONSTRUCTED IT 

675
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,058
REPRESENTS A LEVERAGE FOR 

676
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,526
ECONOMIC GROWTH BUT ALSO 

677
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:32,097
WORKING DOWN ON STREAMLINING AND

678
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:37,202
FINDING REDTAPE ADMINISTRATION. 

679
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,271
WE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE 

680
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:39,804
CORRUPTION POCKETS. 

681
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:42,474
WE ARE TRYING TO SPEED UP CIVIL 

682
00:25:42,474 --> 00:25:46,711
TRIALS, PROCEDURES THAT ALL 

683
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:48,747
SECTORS TOGETHER WITH THE 

684
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:55,554
CITIZEN INCOME THAT WILL SUPPORT

685
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,122
-- THESE ARE ALL OF THE REFORMS 

686
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:58,957
THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE A 

687
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:02,994
POSITIVE ELEMENT -- OF LEVERAGE 

688
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,396
IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE CAN TRY 

689
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,864
TO REACH THE GROWTH. 

690
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,666
>>I DO THINK THIS, ONE OF THE 

691
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:11,569
BIGGEST THINGS THAT WE HAVE 

692
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:14,739
DONE, OBVIOUSLY TAX CUTS, BUT 

693
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,710
IT WOULD ALSO BE CUTS IN 

694
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:19,010
REGULATION. 

695
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,979
I KNOW ITALY WELL AND THEY HAVE 

696
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:23,381
A LOTS OF REGULATION. 

697
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,549
I KNOW THAT THE PRIME MINISTER 

698
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,987
WILL WORK HARD ON THAT. 

699
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:30,188
I THINK FROM OUR STANDPOINT ONE 

700
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,323
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS 

701
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,557
THAT WE DID IS CUTTING 

702
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:33,557
MASSIVELY THESE HORRIBLE 

703
00:26:33,557 --> 00:26:34,559
REGULATIONS. 

704
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,093
I BELIEVE SO STRONGLY IN THE 

705
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:38,396
ENVIRONMENT, I WANT THE 

706
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:42,300
CLEANEST AIR, CLEANEST WATER, 

707
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:42,767
CLEANEST EVERYTHING. 

708
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,135
YOU HAVE 10 REGULATIONS FOR 

709
00:26:44,135 --> 00:26:47,305
EVERY POINT, IT WAS RIDICULOUS. 

710
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:48,640
IT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO GET 

711
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,874
A HIGHWAY OR A ROAD APPROVE. 

712
00:26:49,874 --> 00:26:54,245
WE HAVE THE WEIGHT DOWN IT IS 

713
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,547
DOWN TO TWO YEARS AND HOPEFULLY 

714
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,781
IT WILL GET DOWN TO ONE. 

715
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,049
IT MAY GET REJECTED BUT AT 

716
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,452
LEAST IT WILL GO QUICKLY. 

717
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,686
WE WANT REGULATION BUT IT HAS 

718
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:05,557
TO BE CUT TO A MINIMUM. 

719
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,758
I THINK THAT ITALY WILL FOLLOW 

720
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:06,958
SUIT. 

721
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,592
I KNOW THEY HAVE LOOKED AT IT 

722
00:27:08,592 --> 00:27:09,594
STRONGLY. 

723
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:15,767
THANK YOU. 

724
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:22,774
>>THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT. 

725
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:28,146
YOU SPOKE A BIT ABOUT IRAN TODAY

726
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,681
AND I AM WONDERING IF YOU CAN 

727
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,115
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK IRAN 

728
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:33,384
NEEDS TO DO TO REDUCE TENSION. 

729
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:34,786
YOU HAVE MET WITH THE LEADERS 

730
00:27:34,786 --> 00:27:36,621
OF NORTH KOREA AND RUSSIA. 

731
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,289
ARE YOU PREPARED AND WILLING TO 

732
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:43,528
MEET WITH PRESIDENT -- AND 

733
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:44,129
UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. 

734
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,163
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY PULMONARY 

735
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,297
DISCUSSIONS WITH SOMETHING LIKE 

736
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,166
THAT? 

737
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,403
>> THE PRIME MINISTER SAID IT 

738
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:52,637
BETTER THAN ANYBODY CAN SAY IT. 

739
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:53,438
SPEAKING TO OTHER PEOPLE 

740
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:54,472
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE TALKING 

741
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:55,907
ABOUT POTENTIAL OF WAR AND 

742
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:58,877
DEATH AND FAMINE AND LOTS OF 

743
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,479
OTHER THINGS, THERE IS NOTHING 

744
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,680
WRONG WITH MEETING. 

745
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,386
WE MET WITH CHAIRMAN KIM AND 

746
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:09,187
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A MISSILE 

747
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,355
FIRED OFF IN NINE MONTHS. 

748
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,456
WE GOT OUR PRISONERS BACK. 

749
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,790
SO MANY THINGS HAPPEN THAT ARE 

750
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,392
POSITIVE. 

751
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:19,063
I HAD A GREAT MEETING, THE FAKE 

752
00:28:19,063 --> 00:28:20,398
NEWS DID NOT COVER IT THAT WAY, 

753
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:21,599
I HAD A GREAT MEETING WITH 

754
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,737
PRESIDENT PUTIN OF RUSSIA IN 

755
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,305
TERMS OF THE FUTURE AND IN 

756
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:30,275
TERMS OF SAFETY AND ECONOMIC 

757
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:30,842
DEVELOPMENT AND PROTECTING 

758
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,342
ISRAEL AND PROTECTING 

759
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:31,643
EVERYBODY. 

760
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,678
I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT 

761
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:33,945
MEETING. 

762
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,015
GREAT MEETING WITH NATO, I JUST 

763
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:37,515
EXPLAINED THAT. 

764
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:38,148
HUNDREDS AND BILLIONS OF 

765
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:40,351
DOLLARS MORE MONEY WILL BE PAID 

766
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:45,924
TO NATO. 

767
00:28:45,924 --> 00:28:46,724
I BELIEVE IN MEETING. 

768
00:28:46,724 --> 00:28:47,725
I WOULD CERTAINLY MEET WITH 

769
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:48,927
IRAN IF THEY WANT TO MEET. 

770
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:52,297
I DO NOT KNOW IF THEY ARE READY.

771
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:53,898
THEY ARE HAVING A HARD TIME. 

772
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,833
I ENDED THE IRAN DEAL. 

773
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:56,167
IT WAS A RIDICULOUS DEAL. 

774
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,268
I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL 

775
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:02,607
WANT TO MEET AND I AM READY TO 

776
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:03,641
MEET ANYTIME THEY WANT TO. 

777
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:04,942
I DO NOT DO THAT FROM STRENGTH 

778
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:06,077
OR WEAKNESS, IT IS AN 

779
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:06,978
APPROPRIATE THING TO DO. 

780
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,012
IF WE CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT 

781
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,781
THAT IS MEANINGFUL, NOT THE 

782
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,049
WASTE OF PAPER THAT THE OTHER 

783
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:14,752
DEAL WAS I WOULD BE WILLING TO 

784
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:15,153
MEET. 

785
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,354
>>YOU HAVE PRECONDITIONS? 

786
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:18,089
>> NO. 

787
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,260
THEY WANT TO MEET I'LL MEET, 

788
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,961
ANY TIME THEY WANT. 

789
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,296
IT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY, 

790
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,698
GOOD FOR THEM, GOOD FOR US AND 

791
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,433
GOOD FOR THE WORLD. 

792
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,201
IF THEY WANT TO MEET I WILL 

793
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:33,471
MEET? 

794
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:37,976
>> I WANT TO ASK IF YOU AND THE 

795
00:29:37,976 --> 00:29:39,744
PRESIDENT, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 

796
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,213
NEED TO STABILIZE LIBYA. 

797
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,948
I WANT TO ASK IF YOU AND THE 

798
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:44,515
PRESIDENT DISCUSSED WORKING 

799
00:29:44,515 --> 00:29:45,750
TOGETHER ON ENERGY PRODUCTION 

800
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:52,724
IN LIBYA IN SOME WAY. 

801
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,825
DID YOU DISCUSS OIL PRODUCTION 

802
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,860
IN LIBYA, DID YOU SEE A WAY FOR 

803
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,461
THE UNITED STATES TO BECOME 

804
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:03,468
INVOLVED WITH ITALY'S HELP? 

805
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:07,338
>> WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM OF 

806
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,141
STABILIZING LIBYA AND THE 

807
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:14,479
SECURITY TO BE GUARANTEED FOR 

808
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,147
THE IRANIAN AREA. 

809
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,316
IT IS NOT ONLY A PROBLEM OF THE 

810
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,452
MIGRATION ROUTES FROM AFRICAN 

811
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:25,556
COUNTRIES CONCENTRATE IN THE 

812
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:28,960
LIBYAN AREA, IT IS ALSO A 

813
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,128
PROBLEM WITH SECURITY IN 

814
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:38,503
GENERAL. 

815
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,737
-- FOREIGN FIGHTERS MIGHT REACH 

816
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:42,240
THE EUROPEAN TERRITORY. 

817
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,508
AGENTS WHO COULD CARRY THE 

818
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:47,745
THREAT. 

819
00:30:47,745 --> 00:30:49,380
WE DID NOT DISCUSS IN DETAILS 

820
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,415
THE PROBLEMS. 

821
00:30:51,415 --> 00:30:53,751
CERTAINLY IT IS OUR INTENTION 

822
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,686
TO RESPECT THE LIBYAN 

823
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:54,986
POPULATION. 

824
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:57,922
WE ARE NOT TREATED BY THE 

825
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,057

826
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:02,660

829
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,834
ORGANIZE AN AGREEMENT WITH 

830
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,135
PRESIDENT TRUMP. WE ARE GOING 

831
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:14,439
TO ORGANIZE A CONFERENCE WITH 

832
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:15,039
LIBYA. 

833
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,010
WE WOULD LIKE TO DEAL AND 

834
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,111
DISCUSS ALL OF THE ISSUES 

835
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:21,713
RELATED TO THE LIBYAN PEOPLE 

836
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,548
INVOLVING ALL OF THE 

837

PROTAGONISTS AND -- WE ARE 

839

ASPECTS AND SOCIAL ASPECTS. 

841
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:37,328
THE PROTECTION OF CIVIL RIGHTS. 

842
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,630
THE PROBLEM OF CONSTITUTIONAL 

843
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:43,034
PROCESS OF ISSUING AND PASSING 

844
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:44,702

856
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,497
THERE ARE THREE ISSUES ON THE 

857
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,433
TABLE WITH THE AMERICAN 

858
00:32:16,433 --> 00:32:18,603
ADMINISTRATION ONE IS SANCTIONS 

859
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,607
TO RUSSIA. SINCE ITALY THE TWO 

860
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:27,812
MAIN GOVERNMENT PARTIES IN 

861
00:32:27,812 --> 00:32:28,679
ITALY SAID THEY WANTED TO LIFT 

862
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:29,480
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA, WHAT IS 

863
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,715
THE OFFICIAL POSITION BY THE 

864
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:33,584
GOVERNMENT SINCE THE AMERICAN 

865
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,019

DEPARTMENT HAS TO CONTINUE WITH 

869
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,763
THE WORK AND WHY THERE ARE SOME 

870
00:32:45,763 --> 00:32:46,597
ISSUES IN ITALY WITH THIS 

871
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,734
PROJECT AND THE F 35 PROGRAM, 

872
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,837
WHAT IS ITALY GOING TO DO? WILL 

873
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:53,471
ITALY CONFIRM THE PROGRAM? 

874
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,338
THANK YOU. 

875
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:57,542

876
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:58,609
RELATION TO SANCTIONS ON 

877
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:58,842
RUSSIA. 

878
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:01,979
I AM GOING TO REPEAT WHAT I SAID

879
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,781
BEFORE BECAUSE I HAVE TAKEN A 

880
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:08,419
STANCE IN THE INTERNATIONAL 

881
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:08,719
SUMMITS. 

882
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:09,754
I WILL BE BORING, THIS CONFIRMS 

883
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:10,855
THAT THE POSITION OF THE 

884
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:11,989
GOVERNMENT IS NOT CHANGING IN 

885
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:12,322
THIS RESPECT. 

886
00:33:12,322 --> 00:33:14,826
WE ARE OPEN TO DIALOGUE WITH 

887
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,126
RUSSIA. 

888
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,061
WE DO BELIEVE THAT RUSSIA PLAYS 

889
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:21,766
A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN ALL 

890
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,301

INKING THAT RUSSIA CAN BE KEPT 

893
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,774
OUT OF THE DIALOGUE ESPECIALLY 

894
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,075
IN --, IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE 

895
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:33,811
PROBLEMS WE CANNOT CHOOSE THE 

896
00:33:33,811 --> 00:33:34,512
COUNTERPARTS TO DEAL WITH. 

897
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,281
WE MUST ACCEPT A SEAT AT THE 

898
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,451
TABLE AND NEGOTIATE WITH THOSE 

899
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:47,825
WHO --. AS FAR AS THE SANCTION 

900
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,060
AS SPECIFICALLY CONCERNED WE 

901
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,394
ARE AWARE THAT THE SYSTEM STEMS 

902
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:58,769
FROM THE MINSK AGREEMENT AND -- 

903
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:00,104
IT IS CLEAR THAT IT IS 

904
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:00,905
UNTHINKABLE TODAY TO LIFT 

905
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:02,873
OVERNIGHT THOUGH SANCTIONS. 

906
00:34:02,873 --> 00:34:06,110
HOWEVER, EXACTLY BECAUSE WE ARE 

907
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:09,246
OPEN TO DIALOGUE WITH RUSSIA 

908
00:34:09,246 --> 00:34:14,252
THE POSITION HAS BEEN STATED IS 

909
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:18,789
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM 

910
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,092
DOES NOT AFFECT THE CIVIC 

911
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,762
SOCIETY AND DOESN'T AFFECT THE 

912
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,731
ECONOMY OF THE SMALL 

913
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,065
ENTERPRISES IN RUSSIA. 

914
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:34,105
ITALY HAS A INTENSE ECONOMIC 

915

RELATION WITH RUSSIA IN THIS

00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:36,139
RESPECT. 

917
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,409
IN ORDER TO STRESS ONCE AGAIN 

918
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:40,110
WITH A FINAL STATEMENT, 

919
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,545
SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA ARE 

920
00:34:41,545 --> 00:34:45,683
NOT AND CANNOT REPRESENT AN END

. SECOND ISSUE, -- PIPELINE. 

922
00:34:52,623 --> 00:34:54,056
I DISCUSSED THIS WITH PRESIDENT 

923
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:56,060
TRUMP. 

924
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,762
I REPORTED TO HIM THAT MY 

925
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:02,266
GOVERNMENT IS WELL AWARE OF THE 

926
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,301
FACT THAT THIS IS STRATEGIC 

927
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:04,302
WORK IN TERMS OF ENERGY SUPPLY 

928
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,136
TO ITALY AND TO THE SOUTH OF 

929
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:11,375
EUROPE. WE ARE PERFECTLY AWARE

00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:12,510
OF THE FACT THAT THIS CAN 

931
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,045
PROVIDE A CONTRIBUTION ALSO IN 

932
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:18,182
THE RENEWAL OF THE ENERGY 

933
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:19,250
SYSTEM AND THE ELIMINATION OF 

934
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,784
COAL WHICH IS PART OF THE 

935
00:35:20,784 --> 00:35:26,624
PROGRAM. AT THE SAME TIME I 

936
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:31,629
INFORMED PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT 

937
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,797
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY BY LOCAL 

938
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,434
COMMUNITIES ON WHERE THE 

939
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:40,805
PIPELINE WILL LAND -- NEEDS TO 

940
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,075
BE PHASED PROPERLY ONCE BACK TO 

941
00:35:44,075 --> 00:35:45,843
ITALY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE I 

942
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:51,215
WILL DISCUSS THE ISSUE WITH THE 

943
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,650
MINISTERS AND I WILL GO MEET 

944
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,918
THE LOCAL MAYORS, THE LOCAL 

945
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:55,719
COMMUNITIES AND TRY TO FIND A 

946
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:58,956
SOLUTION WHICH WILL TAKE INTO 

947
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:00,424
ACCOUNT THE CONCERNS OF LOCAL 

948
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,160
COMMUNITIES. AS FAR AS THE 

949
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,329
THIRD POINT IS CONCERNED, -- IS 

950
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,299
A PROGRAM THAT WAS DECIDED IN 

951
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:09,733
2002 THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS 

952
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:12,069
SIGNED. 

953
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:16,607
IT IS A BIG PERIOD OF TIME IN 

954
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,943
TERMS OF TALKING ABOUT NEEDS 

955
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:22,747
FOR DEFENSE AND SECURITY. AS A 

956
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,882
GOVERNMENT WE ARE RESPONSIBLY 

957
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:29,620
EVALUATING --. 

958
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,656
AS YOU KNOW IT IS A PROCESS OF 

959
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,324
ORDERS BEING ISSUED WHICH HAS 

960
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:37,361
TAKEN PLACE AND THESE ORDERS ARE

961
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,864
ISSUED MUCH EARLIER BECAUSE 

962
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:44,669
DESMOND. 

963
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:45,870
WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS 

964
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,838
AND WE WILL MAKE ALL OF THE 

965
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,876
NECESSARY CHOICES IN A CAUTIOUS 

966
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,411
WAY IN VIEW OF THE NEEDS OF 

967
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:55,579
DEFENSE AND SECURITY BEING 

968
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:56,213
TRANSPARENT WITH OUR PARTNERS, 

969
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:57,448
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. 

970
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,719
>>THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

971
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,587
SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA WILL REMAIN 

972
00:37:03,587 --> 00:37:04,889
AS IS. 

973
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,157
AS FAR AS A PIPELINE IS 

974
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:10,861
CONCERNED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 

975
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:11,328
COMPETING PIPELINES. 

976
00:37:11,328 --> 00:37:12,796
MR. PRIME MINISTER I HOPE YOU 

977
00:37:12,796 --> 00:37:14,732
CAN DO THAT COMPETING PIPELINE. 

978
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,933
WE ARE ALREADY TALKING TO THE 

979
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,301
EUROPEAN UNION ABOUT BUILDING 

980
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:20,471
ANYWHERE FROM 9-11 PORTS, WHICH 

981
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,440
THEY WILL PAY FOR, SO THAT WE 

982
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,041
CAN SHIP -- OVER TO VARIOUS 

983
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,010
PARTS OF EUROPE. 

984
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,114
THAT WILL BE MORE COMPETITION. 

985
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:31,582
THE SANCTIONS ON RUSSIA WILL 

986
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,983
REMAIN AS IS. 

987
00:37:32,983 --> 00:37:34,385
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 

988
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:47,732
THANK YOU.

989
00:37:57,374 --> 00:37:58,442
>>YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING A NEWS 

990
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,042

GIUSEPPE CONTE. THE PRESIDENT 

993
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:06,450
SAID HE WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM 

994
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,453
WITH A POTENTIAL GOVERNMENT 

995
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,788
SHUTDOWN SAYING IT IS TIME TO 

996
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,255
HAVE BORDER SECURITY. 

997
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:13,057
HE AND THE PRIME MINISTER 

998
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,928

IT WAS VERY INTERESTING HEARING

PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE PRIME 

1007
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,214
MINISTER OF ITALY. THEY SEEM TO 

1008
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,649
REGARD ONE ANOTHER AS CLOSE 

1009
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,685
ALLIES WHEN IT COMES TO 

1010
00:38:41,685 --> 00:38:43,087
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BEST FRIEND 

1011
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,889
IN THE EU. 

1012
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,256
AT ONE POINT PRIME MINISTER 

1013
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:50,694
CONTE SAID THAT WE ARE ALMOST 

1014
00:38:50,694 --> 00:38:51,061
TWIN COUNTRIES. 

1015
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:52,263
WHAT YOU MAKE OF THEIR 

1016
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:54,331
RELATIONSHIP? 

1017
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,466
>> IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT 

1018
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,767
PRIME MINISTER CONTE TALKED 

1019
00:38:56,767 --> 00:39:01,238
ABOUT -- BEING A REFERENCE 

1020
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:01,939
POINT FOR YOUR. 

1021
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:03,441
HE IS TALKING ABOUT A COUPLE OF 

1022
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,508
TRENDS FIRST STARTED BY 

1023
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:05,042
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 

1024
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:06,444
AND OUTSIDERS SEEKING HIGH 

1025
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,579
ELECTED OFFICE AND PURSUING A 

1026
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:13,751
POLICY ECONOMICALLY AND ON 

1027
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,952
BORDER SECURITY THAT CAN BE 

1028
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:16,053
DESCRIBED AS A COMBINATION OF 

1029
00:39:16,053 --> 00:39:16,620
POPULISM AND NATIONALISM. 

1030
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:20,925
PRIME MINISTER CONTE DID THAT. 

1031
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:21,859
HE LEADS A COALITION GOVERNMENT 

1032
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,893
THAT EMPHASIZED SOME OF THOSE 

1033
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:23,694
ISSUES AND SITS ATOP THE 

1034
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,728
ITALIAN GOVERNMENT WITH A 

1035
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:25,696
PERSPECTIVE NOT UNLIKE 

1036
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,798
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON ECONOMIC 

1037
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:32,503
NATIONALISM AND BORDER SECURITY.

1038
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,804
AS DEFINED FROM A POPULOUS 

1039
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:35,106
PERSPECTIVE OR A NATIONALIST 

1040
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,040
PERSPECTIVE. 

1041
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,846
THEY ARE IN CERTAIN WAYS 

1042
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,346
ALIGNED IDEOLOGICALLY. 

1043
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:43,247
IF I HAD BEEN GIVEN THE 

1044
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:44,248
OPPORTUNITY I WOULD HAVE ASKED 

1045
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,751
BY MINISTER CONTE TO DESCRIBE 

1046
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:47,685
THE TRUMP EFFECT THROUGHOT 

1047
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:47,885
YOUR. 

1048
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,721
IF HE DESCRIBED ITALY AS A 

1049
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,788
REFERENCE POINT FOR EUROPE THIS 

1050
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:53,424
HE BELIEVED THIS IS A TREND 

1051
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,024
THAT WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT 

1052
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:54,258
EUROPE? 

1053
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,993
OR IS ITALY MORE OR LESS AN 

1054
00:39:55,993 --> 00:40:01,799
EXPERIMENT, BUT A DEFINED ONE 

1055
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:02,600
NATION EXPERIMENT WITH THESE 

1056
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,868
NOTIONS OF INTEGRATED POPULISM

1057
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:06,070
AND NATIONALISM INTO THE 

1058
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:06,570
EUROPEAN CONVERSATION. 

1059
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,172
I DID NOT GET THAT CHANCE. 

1060
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:09,173
I WOULD HAVE BEEN ENLIGHTENED 

1061
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:13,644
BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S ANSWER. 

1062
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:15,513
>> WE WISH YOU WERE ABLE TO 

1063
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,281
ASKED THAT QUESTION. 

1064
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:18,616
>> A COUPLE OF THINGS WORTH 

1065
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:20,017
POINTING OUT ABOUT THE PRESS 

1066
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:23,521
CONFERENCE. 

1067
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,955
TWO THINGS THAT WE NEED TO LOCK 

1068
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:25,456
IN ON. 

1069
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:26,657
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE IS OPEN 

1070
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,691
TO TALKS WITH IRAN AT THE 

1071
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,692
HIGHEST LEVELS WITH NO 

1072
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:29,059
PRECONDITIONS. 

1073
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,227
I DON'T THINK AND NO ONE IN 

1074
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:31,595
THIS ROOM BELIEVES THAT WILL 

1075
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,763
HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON. 

1076
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,098
THAT IS A MEANS BY WHICH THE 

1077
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:34,999
PRESIDENT IS SAYING HE WILL 

1078
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,700
TALK TO ANYBODY UNDER ANY 

1079
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,102
CIRCUMSTANCES, EVEN THE HEAD OF 

1080
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,637
THE IRANIAN REGIME OVER THIS 

1081
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,205
ISSUE OF THEIR PURSUIT OF 

1082
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,673
NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN SUPPORT OF 

1083
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,141
TERRORISM THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE 

1084
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,743
EAST AND ON THE SHUTDOWN 

1085
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:47,578
SCENARIO, THE PRESIDENT GAVE 

1086
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,579
HIMSELF A LITTLE WIGGLE ROOM 

1087
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,683
ABOUT THE SPECIFICS. HOW MUCH 

1088
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,251
MONEY, WHAT HE WOULD NEED TO 

1089
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:55,319
SEE LEGISLATIVELY. 

1090
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,120
MAKE NO MISTAKE THE PRESIDENT 

1091
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,790
WAS TRYING TO SEND A SIGNAL TO 

1092
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:00,323
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICAN 

1093
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:00,590
LEADERS. 

1094
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:02,025
HE IS NOT BLUFFING ON THE 

1095
00:41:02,025 --> 00:41:07,898
SHUTDOWN AND HE MAY TRY TO USE 

1096
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:08,933
THAT AS A POLITICAL WEDGE ISSUE 

1097
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,434
IN THE HEAT OF THE MIDTERM 

1098
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:11,268
ELECTIONS EVEN IF MANY 

1099
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:12,169
REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING THOSE AT 

1100
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,270
THE TOP OF THE LEADERSHIP IN 

1101
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,873
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE ARE 

1102
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,041
UNENTHUSIASTIC TO PUT IT MILDLY 

1103
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:17,508
ABOUT THAT STRATEGY. 

1104
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:22,313
>> HE DID SAY WHEN PRESSED ON 

1105
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,414
THAT POINT BY A REPORTER THAT 

1106
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,749
HE HAS NO REDLINE AND THAT 

1107
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:26,616
THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR 

1108
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:27,484
NEGOTIATION. 

1109
00:41:27,484 --> 00:41:28,719
THAT IS SORT OF AN OPENING IN 

1110
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,420
THE DOOR TO CONGRESS. 

1111
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,526
>> CERTAINLY EVERYTHING IS OPEN 

1112
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,194
TO NEGOTIATION FOR ANY 

1113
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:40,097
PRESIDENT DEALING WITH CONGRESS.

1114
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,231
THE QUESTION OF A SHUTDOWN 

1115
00:41:41,231 --> 00:41:42,700
LOOMS LARGE OVER REPUBLICANS. 

1116
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:51,542
SHUTDOWN POLITICS TYPICALLY 

1117
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,776
REBOUND TO THE PARTY IN POWER. 

1118
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:53,677
YOU CANNOT MANAGE GOVERNMENT 

1119
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:54,678
AND BE AN EFFECTIVE LEGISLATIVE 

1120
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,879
BODY, REPUBLICANS HAVE TOLD THE 

1121
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:56,480
COUNTRY THROUGHOUT AND THEY 

1122
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,448
WILL SAY THIS DURING THE 

1123
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,248
ELECTIONS, KEEP REPUBLICANS IN 

1124
00:41:58,248 --> 00:41:59,516
CONTROL WE KNOW HOW TO MANAGE 

1125
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:01,619
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 

1126
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,553
IF YOU ARE SHUTTING THE FEDERAL 

1127
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:03,554
GOVERNMENT DOWN AS YOU ARE 

1128
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,788
EXCITING YOU KNOW HOW TO MANAGE 

1129
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:08,759
IT, THAT IS A MIXED MESSAGE. 

1130
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:09,326
ONE THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD 

1131
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:10,494
PREFER TO AVOID IN A MIDTERM 

1132
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:11,395
ELECTION WHEN DEMOCRATS WILL 

1133
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,464
SAY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU 

1134
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,332
NEED TO ELECT DEMOCRATS IS SO 

1135
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,166
THAT THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT 

1136
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:17,334
MANAGEMET OF THE CONGRESS AND 

1137
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,802
MORE CHECKS AND BALANCES ON THE 

1138
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:19,737
PRESIDENT. 

1139
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:25,275
THE PRESIDENT IS BETTING THE 

1140
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:26,377
IMMIGRATION ISSUE WILL WORK FOR 

1141
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,511
HIM NATIONALLY. 

1142
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:31,048
MANY REPUBLICANS THAT I TALK TO 

1143
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:31,882
THINK IT WORKS IN CERTAIN 

1144
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,817
GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND IN CERTAIN 

1145
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:35,352
AUDIENCES BUT IT IS NOT A 

1146
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,620
ROBUST MOTIVATING ISSUE FOR 

1147
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,890
REPUBLICANS GENERALLY IN A WAY 

1148
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:40,924
THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR 

1149
00:42:40,924 --> 00:42:41,558
CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS IN ALL 

1150
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,659
50 STATES. 

1151
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:43,226
>>SHOULDN'T THAT WORRY THE 

1152
00:42:43,226 --> 00:42:44,494
PRESIDENT FROM A STRATEGIC 

1153
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:45,296
STANDPOINT? 

1154
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,731
LET'S SAY IT RALLIES HIS BASE, 

1155
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,266
IF IT DOES MAKE REPUBLICANS 

1156
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:51,535
VULNERABLE IN THEIR HOME 

1157
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:55,939
CONSTITUENTS, DOESN'T THAT MEAN 

1158
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:57,141
HE COULD RISK LOSING SEEDS TO 

1159
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:59,810
DEMOCRATS WHICH IN TURN MAKES 

1160
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,611
HIS LEGISLATIVE AGENDA MORE 

1161
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:04,882
DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH? 

1162
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:05,282
>> CERTAINLY. 

1163
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:06,450
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE 

1164
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,217
DEFINITE RISK FACTORS. 

1165
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,185
YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED THEM 

1166
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:10,587
PRECISELY. 

1167
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:11,622
THIS IS A LEARNING LESSON FOR 

1168
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,223
THE PRESIDENT AND HIS POLITICAL 

1169
00:43:13,223 --> 00:43:14,558
TEAM WHICH REALLY STARTS AND 

1170
00:43:14,558 --> 00:43:18,962
ENDS WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF 

1171
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:19,830
AND HIS OWN POLITICAL 

1172
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,130
INSTINCTS. 

1173
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,799
HE HAD AN INSTINCT IN THE 2016 

1174
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,600
CAMPAIGN, A HARD EDGE MESSAGE 

1175
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,601
THAT HE NEVER FLINCHED FROM OR 

1176
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,403
BACKED AWAY FROM, IT COULD 

1177
00:43:26,403 --> 00:43:27,003
PROVE NATIONALLY EFFECTIVE. 

1178
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:30,974
HE WAS RIGHT. 

1179
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:31,909
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MIDTERM 

1180
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:32,509
ELECTION IS THAT THE 

1181
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,846
CONVERSATION IS MUCH NARROWER. 

1182
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,547
YOU CAN'T DISTRIBUTE TRUMP 

1183
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:37,581
SUPPORTERS IN THE VARIOUS 

1184
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,181
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS THAT 

1185
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:38,916
ARE UP FOR GRABS. 

1186
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:39,750
MANY OF THE CONGRESSIONAL 

1187
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,318
DISTRICTS THAT WILL BE THE MOST 

1188
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,586
COMPETITIVE HAVE FEWER HARD-

1189
00:43:42,586 --> 00:43:44,054
CORE TRUMP SUPPORTERS AS THEY 

1190
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:47,191
DO NON-ATTACHED REPUBLICANS OR 

1191
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:49,793
FIERCELY MOTIVATED DEMOCRATS OR 

1192
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,361
INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE HAVING A 

1193
00:43:51,361 --> 00:43:53,497
SECOND LOOK OR SOME DEGREE OF 

1194
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,432
BUYERS REMORSE SIDING WITH 

1195
00:43:55,432 --> 00:43:56,900
PRESIDENT TRUMP. THOSE ARE 

1196
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,103
THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO FLUSH 

1197
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:05,008
THEMSELVES OUT IN THE MIDTERM 

1198
00:44:05,008 --> 00:44:05,308
ELECTIONS. 

1199
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:06,210
IT APPEARS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1200
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,444
IS GOING TO REPLACE HIS 2016 

1201
00:44:07,444 --> 00:44:07,711
STRATEGY. 

1202
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:08,645
THAT IS A NATIONAL ELECTORAL 

1203
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,146
COLLEGE STRATEGY IN A MIDTERM 

1204
00:44:10,146 --> 00:44:10,681
ELECTION. 

1205
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:14,451
THE VOTES ARE COUNTED AND THE 

1206
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,552
RESULTS ARE MUCH MORE NARROWLY 

1207
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:15,785
DRAWN. 

1208
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:16,319
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT I 

1209
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,287
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, SENATE 

1210
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:20,157
RACE BY SENATE RACE. 

1211
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,325
THIS IS A BIG RISK. 

1212
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:26,163
>> BEFORE I LET YOU GO I WANT 

1213
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,564
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ON TRADE. 

1214
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:29,500
DO WE HAVE DETAILS ON EXACTLY 

1215
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,968
WHAT PRIME MINISTER CONTE AND 

1216
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:31,568
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP AGREED 

1217
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:33,837
UPON IN REGARDS TO TRADE? 

1218
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,272
>> NOTHING THAT I HAVE SEEN 

1219
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,840
THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED BY THE 

1220
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,344
WHITE HOUSE. 

1221
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,578
A LOT OF AGREEABLE WORDS ABOUT 

1222
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:42,579
COMBINING FORCES, WORKING ON 

1223
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,580
ENERGY, SHARING THE SAME 

1224
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:44,247
APPROACH TO UNDERLYING ISSUES 

1225
00:44:44,247 --> 00:44:45,315
AND THE PRIME MINISTER SAYING 

1226
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,917
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS A GOOD 

1227
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:48,919
NEGOTIATOR REFERRING BACK TO 

1228
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:50,721
THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING THAT 

1229
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,456
THE PRESIDENT REACHED LAST WEEK 

1230
00:44:52,456 --> 00:44:54,090
WITH THE HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN 

1231
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:58,529
COMMISSION ABOUT HAVING MORE 

1232
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,763
TALKS AND AVOID A FULL ON TRADE 

1233
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:02,599
WAR WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION. 

1234
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,134
THAT CREATES AN OPENING AND IT 

1235
00:45:04,134 --> 00:45:05,369
CREATES SPACE TO TAKE HEAT OFF 

1236
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,971
OF THE ISSUE. 

1237
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:09,073
THE NEGOTIATING STILL GOES ON. 

1238
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:10,541
THE END RESULT IS STILL 

1239
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,042
UNCLEAR. 

1240
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,113
>> MAJOR GARRETT, IN 

1241
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:16,413
WASHINGTON. 

1242
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:16,713
THANK YOU. 

1243
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,415
>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 

1244
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:19,316
BREAK. 

1245
00:45:19,316 --> 00:00:00,000
MORE NEWS AHEAD.
