any us now Barbara McQuade former federal prosecutor and a professor of law at the University of Michigan she's also an NBC News and MSNBC legal contributor David Cay Johnston is with us Pulitzer Prize winning journalist who founded DC report or he's the author of the new book it's even worse than you think what the Trump administration is doing to America and Michael is a chief investigative correspondent for Yahoo News and co-author of the new book Russian Roulette the inside story of Putin's war on America and the election of Donald Trump and Michael I'd like you to respond to what you just heard from the latest member the newest member of the Trump legal team that all of this is a violation of the president's civil rights seems totally in sync with the president's tweets doesn't it yes no not a surprise that he would go out to Jodi Jennifer look the way I interpret this everybody's looked at this as is he gonna fire Muller and you hear contradictory things John Dowd says yes you know then Ty Cobb comes up with no we to pretend to fully cooperate you could take all of this the president's tweets the hiring of gentlemen and reach the conclusion that the real strategy here is to put down these conditions for the interview say will we the lawyers will write the answers Muller's not going to accept that you know he's a prosecutor he's not gonna accept what the defense lawyers write out so he will push at that point Trump says no I my lawyers have told you what they're gonna say you know take it or leave it what's Muller's option subpoena what's Trump's option he could cave war he more likely will say no I'm not going to accede to the subpoena we'll take it to court drag this out to court he doesn't have to fire Muller but what he is doing is laying the groundwork to do legitimize Muller and resist a Muller subpoena and that puts this into the realm of the courts to slug it out does the Muller have the adequate criminal predicate to prevail ultimately this goes to the Supreme Court where Trump probably figures he's got the upper hand so he doesn't have to fire Muller to adopt a strategy that basically says you know forget it molar I'm not cooperating let it you know let's let this play out drags it out for quite some time Barbara on the on the delay Muller instead of fire Mahler strategy that Michael just laid out which sounds very convincing how long would the delay Muller strategy work yeah it's a very interesting theory and may very well explain what's going on I don't think it would work for a long period of time you know ordinarily when a case works its way all the way up to the Supreme Court it can take a year or more to work through that process but in a case like this the Supreme Court does have the ability to go on a very expedited docket when it is in the public interest to do that to do so we've seen that with respect to the travel ban we saw that in the US v Nixon case and so I think they could get that there the case together within a matter of weeks or months and not years so I think he could delay it for some period of time but I don't think it could be a lengthy delay David the New York Times wrote a story about eight days ago indicating that that Donald Trump was considering hiring more lawyers he then tweeted furiously saying the failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating I'm unhappy with my legal team on the Russian case and I'm going to add another lawyer to help out wrong I am very happy with my lawyers John Dowd Ty Cobb Jay Sekulow they are doing a great job and of course that tweet turns out to be a complete lie what do you make of the the latest addition to the Trump legal team well yes almost like a schoolyard game of you know do the opposite so when Donald deny something that's not true you do see the opposite you know Michael is scoffs theory is very intriguing let me offer another one from having reviewed some of the documents today it's also possible that one of the strategies they're thinking about is to let Muller continue his work and provide them with as minimal information as they can possibly get away with but Muller's job is to file a report if they get rid of Rob Rosenstein and put in someone who is friendly to trump that report could just be buried and we will never see it they might even physically destroy the report thank you we've received the report we've read it and then they put it in a shredder Michael the the the the idea that firing mccabe is was a kind of let's test the waters let's see how how firing feels publicly the the the the difference is that there's an inspector general's report that we have not yet seen that we are all waiting to see I'm reserving judgment on what this is about until I see that as we should but it seems like you're gonna have trouble trying to reproduce that kind of element in in other firings an actual Inspector General's recommendation right and I'm not sure the Inspector General necessarily recommended the firing Inspector General made his findings Michael Horowitz general seems to have said that he recommended it well the certainly the the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility recommended firing based on the conclusions but look the problem is that Trump tainted the whole process yeah by then attacking McCabe and making it seem like this was the outcome he wanted so that even if the people in the Justice Department thought they were doing the right thing they basically got sabotage by the boss who made it look political so in some respects Trump I you know shot himself in the foot here because you know he undermined what could have been an advantage for him to have McCain fired by you know career professionals in the Justice Department although it was obviously sessions who made the final decision but then if you go back to what I think the larger strategy here which is to D legitimize everything to do with the mauler investigation you know it wasn't so it wasn't such a bad move because to the extent that you can raise questions about McCabe and McCabe is a potential witness on any obstruction charge he's accomplished his goal so I think this all fits back with the theory I was saying before which is d legitimize everything to do with Muller and then resist you know if the firearm just resists Berbick red when will we see the Inspector General's report I think I've read that it may be coming out within a couple of weeks but I think that's one of the points that's really extraordinary here ordinarily you get the report and then you make the decision and the public decision about the firing and so I agree with Michael and David that the the firing does appear to be spiteful and vindictive in an effort to discredit Andrew McCabe a potential witness in the obstruction of justice case to fire him you know what 26 hours before his 50th birthday so that he cannot collect his pension you know strikes me as very extraordinary but I think we're expecting within about a you know two weeks that it'll come out it's not ready yet and so the decision should have waited until the report is ready David you've been studying Trump longer than the rest of us for decades now there's a tweet this morning where he says a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interests explanation point and and that's it that's the whole tweet it's just this burst if you're judging well let me ask you do you think it's it that it actually does work to judge Trump's moods on Twitter actually use Twitter to judge how he's feeling yeah to some degree absolutely and in this particular tweet this morning you know Donald keeps wanting to call this a witch-hunt because as Michael said he wants to deal Ajith amis the process here you know we have someone who his whole life has summed his nose at the law broken all sorts of different laws and paid almost no price for it throughout his life and look where it's gotten him so we shouldn't expect that he will change his behavior in any way because this has always worked for him if there's clarity muddy the waters that's a fundamental Donald principle if someone is investigating you turn around and attack them something Roy Cohn taught him to do and we're gonna see this ramped up now but he's look at the success he's had all of the key people in the FBI investigation Cohen is top team have been vanquished at this point in terms of their ability to carry out the functions they had at the at the FBI no they may come back to haunt him as witnesses later but he's vanquished them for the moment David Cay Johnston Barbara McQuade Michael Isikoff thank you all for joining us really appreciate hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC
