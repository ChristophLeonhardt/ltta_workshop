Harris: NEW DEVELOPMENTS AND THE G.O.P. CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S PROBE AT THE 2016 TRUMP CAMPAIGN. AN AIDE TO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE SAID THEY EXPECT FUSION GPS COFOUNDER GLENN SIMPSON TO COMPLY WITH THE SUBPOENA AND APPEAR BEFORE INVESTIGATORS FOR A DEPOSITION TOMORROW. SIMPSON'S ATTORNEY SAYS HIS CLIENT INTENDS TO TAKE THE FIFTH AND REFUSED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. REPUBLICANS SAY SIMPSON'S DECISION NOT TO TALK DOES NOT SURPRISE THEM AS WELL. THAT'S BECAUSE HIS PAST TESTIMONY APPARENTLY CONTRADICTS THE TESTIMONY OF TOP DOJ OFFICIAL BRUCE OHR. SIMPSON CLAIMS HE AND OHR NEVER MET TO DISCUSS THE DOSSIER. OF COURSE HIS WIFE NELLIE WORKED FOR GPS. JOHN RATCLIFFE SAYS HE UNDERSTANDS WHY SIMPSON WOULD WANT TO TAKE THE FIFTH. I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT HE WOULD WANT TO TAKE THE FIFTH. REMEMBER, IT'S THE EXTRAORDINARY MEASURE OF GETTING THE WARRANT TO SPY ON AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. AND IF THAT WAS DONE UNDER FALSE PRETENSES AND FALSE INFORMATION UNDER FALSE PRETENSES, THEN THAT'S VIOLATING SOMEONE'S CIVIL LIBERTIES UNDER COLOR OF LAW. Harris: SO JUDGE KNAPP SAYS THAT'S AFFECTIONATE FOR JUDGE NAPOLITANO. THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO THIS. Judge Napolitano: SO THE TWO SIDES, WITH TOP SECURITY CLEARANCES SAY THAT THEY HAVE SEEN ALL THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE FISA COURT AND THEY HAVE SEEN DOCUMENTS THAT WERE NOT GIVEN TO THE PFIZER COURT, AND IF THE COURT HAD SEEN WHAT THEY SAW, NO WARRANT WOULD HAVE BEEN ISSUED AND THIS ENTIRE INVESTIGATION WOULD HAVE NEVER COMMENCED. IF THEY WOULD HAVE PERSUADED THE PRESIDENT TO EXPOSE IT, ISRAELI INTELLIGENCE MUST HAVE BEEN INVOLVED, BRITISH AND TELEVISIONS MUST HAVE BEEN INVOLVED AND DISSUADED THE PRESIDENT FROM REVEALING THE APPLICATIONS. THE OTHER SIDE IS, WAIT A MINUTE, YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND THE SUBJECT IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. YOU CAN'T DISRUPT A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION FOR POLITICAL REASONS, YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS OVER. I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE, AND IT'S A BAD EXPERIENCE, IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO LEARN THAT THE PEOPLE WHO CAME TO YOU FOR A SEARCH WARRANT DID NOT TELL YOU EVERYTHING YOU WANTED TO KNOW. Harris: CLEARLY. Harris: I'M TRYING A CASE AND I SAVED THE PROSECUTOR'S, WHERE DID YOU GET THIS BLOOD? WHILE SOMEBODY SIGNED A SEARCH WARRANT TO GET THIS TO US. WELL, WHICH JUDGE SIGNED THAT? THREE YEARS AGO. THE CONSEQUENCE OF MISLEADING A COURT CAN BE CATASTROPHIC TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. WHAT IF THAT COURT IS SECRET? WHAT IF IT OPERATES LIKE THE PFIZER COURT DOES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO OVERSIGHT AND ESSENTIALLY IT'S A RUBBER STAMP? THAT'S WHY JUDGES HAVE TO NOT BEND OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN YOUR POSSESSION THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN? IF THEY SAY NO AND THE ANSWER IS YES, THEY HAVE MISLED THE COURT. QUICK SUGGESTION MELISSA AND I WILL GO RIGHT TO YOU. WHAT YOU AND KENNEDY ARE TALKING ABOUT IS POWER. IN SECRECY, WE GAIN SO MUCH POWER. WHAT IF THE COURT FEEL SO POWERFUL IT DOESN'T NEED TO ASK ANYMORE QUESTIONS? SECRECY IS DANGEROUS TO POWER, IT ENHANCES POWER AND TO PERMIT THE ABUSE OF POWER WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN CONDEMNING THIS FISA COURT SINCE IT WAS CREATED. LOOK HOW LONG AND HARD JOURNALISTS AND POLITICIANS HAVE HAD TO WORK JUST TO SEE THAT PFIZER WARRANT APPLICATION. BUT CAN I ASK THE QUESTION, SOMEONE IS LYING ABOUT WHERE THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT THIS DOSSIER AND SHOPPING IT AROUND, AND, THEY ARE MAKING EFFORT TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE EARLIER RATHER THAN LATER NOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT IN THIS LIFE. IF A COURT IS THE RECIPIENT OF A LIE, IF A LAWYER OR PERSON AFFILIATED WITH THE COURT COULD BE AN FBI AGENT, THAT MAKES A MATERIAL MISREPRESENTATION OF THE COURT. THAT PERSON'S CAREER IS IN JEOPARDY. AND BECAUSE OF THAT LIE I'M GUESS I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON THE TESTIMONY HERE. I UNDERSTAND WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD HAVE CONCERNS TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE BECAUSE SO MUCH OF WHAT IS RELEASED THESE DAYS IS CHERRY PICKING INFORMATION. PEOPLE GO IN AND TO TESTIFY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND SOME OF THAT TESTIMONY ENDS UP GETTING LEAKS. THAT'S NOT CONCLUSIVE. I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE WOULD HAVE INTERPRETATION AT THIS CURRENT STAGE TESTIFYING, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS TEND TO CHERRY PICK. FROM WHAT WE KNEW ABOUT
