ROB: ALL RIGHT, WELCOME BACK,
THE COUNTDOWN IS ON, POLLS
OPENING IN JUST 24 HOURS FOR
PRIMARY RACES IN FOUR KEY
STATES, REPUBLICANS IN INDIANA,
WEST VIRGINIA, OHIO AND NORTH
CAROLINA WILL PICK THEIR
CANDIDATES FOR CONGRESS TOMORROW
AND THE STAKES ARE PRETTY HIGH
IN SOME OF THE CASES, WHAT
SHOULD WITH LOOK OUT FOR, HERE
THE BREAK IT DOWN FOR US, SCOTT,
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING ON
THIS MORNING.
WE START IN WEST VIRGINIA WHERE
WE HAVE AN INTERESTING RACE AND
WE HAVE A VERY VULNERABLE SEAT
THAT'S HELD BY JOE MANCHIN.
>> JOE MANCHIN HAS BEEN ELECTED
FOR 36 YEARS, DONALD TRUMP WON
THE STATE BY 42 POINTS.
THIS IS -- ROB: SHOCKER.
>> THIS IS WHAT MAKES HIM
VULNERABLE.
THE QUESTION IS THERE'S THREE
REPUBLICANS IN THE PRIMARY,
JENKINS, MORRIS AND BLANKENSHIP,
JENKINS, CLEARLY TOSS-UP RACE,
VERY COMPETITIVE, MANCHIN WILL
HAVE HANDS FULL.
BLANKENSHIP, IF HE WINS, MANCHIN
WILL HAVE A BREATHER.
A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SEND
OUT A TWEET DON'T VOTE FOR
BLANKENSHIP, WE WILL SEE.
ROB: ALL FIGHT TO GO SEE HOW --
THEY ARE ALL TIEING --
>> SURE.
ROB: WE HAVE OHIO NEXT AND
ANOTHER POSSIBLE VULNERABLE
SEAT.
>> BROWN IS NOT AS VULNERABLE AS
JOE MANCHIN BUT DONALD TRUMP DID
WIN THE STATE BY 8 POINTS,
BIGGEST MARGIN IN OHIO SINCE
1980's AND BROWN IS A LITTLE
BIT NERVOUS, JIM, THE REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN IS HEAVILY FAVORED
TO WIN THE PRIMARY BUT BOTH
CANDIDATES ARE SUPPORTIVE OF
DONALD TRUMP.
ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
ROB: THE GOVERNOR THERE KASICH,
NEVER-TRUMPER REPUBLICAN
GOVERNOR INTERESTING TO SEE WHO
WILL TAKE THAT SPOT?
>> THE ONE THING IT WON'T BE
ANYBODY LIKE JOHN KASICH, THEY
ARE BOTH RUN GET AWAY FROM HIM,
THEY ARE BOTH SAYING WE ARE THE
BEST SUPPORTER OF DONALD TRUMP,
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TAYLOR ALSO
HOPE TO GO TAKE THE SHOT, THEY
ARE BOTH AS I SAID, THEY ARE
NEVER KASICHS AT THIS POINT AS
OPPOSE TO NEVER TRUMPERS, ON THE
DEMOCRATIC SIDE WE HAVE RICHARD,
CHANNELING ELIZABETH WARREN AT
THE CONSUMER FINANCE BUREAU, BUT
HE'S ONE OF THE MORE MODERATES
IN THE RACE, HE'S FAVORED.
AT THE END OF THE DAY N OHIO IF
THINGS GOES AS WE EXPECT IN
PRIMARIES, DEMOCRATS WILL BE
NARROWLY FAVOR TODAY WIN IN THE
SENATE RACE, REPUBLICANS IN THE
GOVERNOR'S RACE.
ROB: OKAY, JOE DONLY IN INDIANA
AND THIS IS THE NASTIEST FIGHT
OF THEM ALL FOR REPUBLICAN
PRIMARY?
>> TWO GUYS, RENAACCI.
ROB: COMES OUT OF NO WHERE.
>> SPEND AUGUST LOT OF MONEY OF
HIS OWN, $6 MILLION, KEY STORY
HERE IS ANY ONE OF THESE THREE
CAN BE -- CAN BEAT JOE DONLY,
IT'S BEEN A COMPETITIVE RACE,
QUESTION FROM THE REPUBLICANS,
CAN THEY UNIFY.
ROB: OKAY, MIKE BRAU, IN THE
LEADER THERE.
>> BY THE WAY, MOST OF THE
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON ARE AT
STATE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL AND
THERE'S A COURT-ORDERED
REDRAWING OF THE DISTRICTS, A
LOT OF CONFUSION, A RISK HERE
FOR THE REPUBLICANS THEY
CURRENTLY HAVE 10 OF THE 13
SEATS IN NORTH CAROLINA.  ROB:
OKAY.
>> ANY PICK-UPS ACHIEVE THE
OVERALL GOAL FOR NEEDING 23
SEATS TO WIN OF CONTROL OF THE
U.S. HOUSE.
ROB: THE SITUATION IS
ADVANTAGEOUS, THEY HAVE
WITHDRAWN TO ALLEGE GET RED OF
GERRYMANDERING WHICH IS WHAT
THEY FOUGHT FOR.
>> HE'S FACING A REMATCH IN THE
PRIMARY AGAINST THE SAME
CANDIDATE MARK HARRIES THAT HE
WON BY 134 VOTES TWO YEARS AGO,
THIS IS A PLACE WHERE THE
REPUBLICANS ARE REALLY HOPING TO
HANG ONTO, INCUMBENTS AND ANY
ADVANTAGE THEY CAN.
ROB: THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING,
IT GETS A LOT MORE COMPLICATED.
>> WE HAVE ABOUT 30 PRIMARIES
