47
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,740
go you got a lot of cable okay we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,900
lot of cable we can mount it over here

49
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere against the wall something all</font>

50
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,050
we can mount it closer but I thought

51
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,240
squared up right<font color="#E5E5E5"> about here and run it</font>

52
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,330
