1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,366
PROGRAM, HE WAS OFFERED THE JOB

2
00:00:05,366 --> 00:00:09,570
AND HE REGRETTED TURNING IT

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:09,971
DOWN.

4
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:12,206
SHE DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION.

5
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:18,513
AND WE'LL HAVE SEBAEFTIAN GORKAN

6
00:00:18,513 --> 00:00:23,117
AND SECRET SERVICE AGENT DAN.

7
00:00:23,117 --> 00:00:23,851
STARTING WITH YOU.

8
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:25,720
ALL OF THE THINGS THAT THE MAYOR

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,121
SAID LAST NIGHT.

10
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:28,923
AND THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY

11
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:30,691
SAID LAST NIGHT ABOUT HILLARY

12
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,628
AND ABOUT MUELLER AND ABOUT

13
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:34,796
COMEY AND THE INVESTIGATION,

14
00:00:34,796 --> 00:00:37,865
HUGE NEWS THAT HE'S MAKING HERE,

15
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,668
AND THEY FOCUS ON 30 SECONDS

16
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,970
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE CORRUPT

17
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,871
MEDIA GOES.

18
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:47,542
THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE

19
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:47,875
TRUTH.

20
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,577
>> FIRST THINGS FIRST.

21
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:51,379
I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE YOU, YOU

22
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:53,481
ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THE

23
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:55,149
PRESIDENT'S RECORD FOR LIVING

24
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,952
RENT FREE IN THE MIND OF THE

25
00:00:57,952 --> 00:00:58,886
LIBERAL LEFT WING MEDIA.

26
00:00:58,886 --> 00:01:01,155
THEY ARE OBSESSED WITH YOU.

27
00:01:01,155 --> 00:01:03,057
AND I LIKE HOW THEY SFENT THE

28
00:01:03,057 --> 00:01:04,858
WHOLE DAY.

29
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,160
THEY SELECTED ONE-HALF OF

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,362
A SENTENCE FROM THE MAYOR'S

31
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:11,199
STATEMENT AND THEY MISSED THE

32
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:11,833
BEGINNING.

33
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,534
AMONGST OTHER THINGS THAT'S THE

34
00:01:13,534 --> 00:01:16,537
REASON WHY HE WAS FIRED.

35
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:18,806
AND THESE PEOPLE INVENTORY

36
00:01:18,806 --> 00:01:21,042
PASSED YEAR ONE IN JOURNALISM

37
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:23,211
SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE TO MAINTAIN

38
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,745
A NARRATIVE.

39
00:01:24,745 --> 00:01:25,847
LIKE THE 49 QUESTIONS.

40
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:28,049
THEY ARE A MARK OF DESPERATION.

41
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:29,417
THERE IS NO CASE.

42
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:31,752
THERE IS NO CONCLUSION AND

43
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:33,588
THREE- QUARTERS OF THE QUESTION

44
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:36,123
IS TRYING TO POLICE YOUR

45
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:36,490
THOUGHT.

46
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,861
WE ONLY DO THAT IN DICTATORSHIP

47
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:44,098
AND NOT IN AMERICA, SEAN.

48
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:46,667
>> Sean: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

49
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:47,435
COMB'S'S TELL.

50
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:50,838
AND WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

51
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,406
SESSION'S REUSUAL.

52
00:01:52,406 --> 00:01:54,041
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE

53
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:54,442
THOUGHT.

54
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:56,777
IT MATTERS WHAT HE DID.

55
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:57,745
>> NO.

56
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:00,114
>> Sean: AND THE FACT THAT THAT

57
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:03,384
GOES OVER HIS HAND ONE HAND

58
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:06,020
INFURIATES ME AND THEN ON THE

59
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,356
OTHER HAND I HAVE TO LAUGH.

60
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:12,693
RUDY GUILIANI TALKS ABOUT HOW

61
00:02:12,693 --> 00:02:17,331
MUELLER'S QUESTIONSAR A PERJURY

62
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,467
TRAP AND COMEY IS A DISGRACEFUL

63
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:21,035
LIAR AND HOW HILLARY IS

64
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:22,937
A CRIMINAL AND BELONGS IN JAIL

65
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:25,673
AND COMEY FIXED THE ENTIRE CASE

66
00:02:25,673 --> 00:02:27,608
WITH HILLARY AND TALKED ABOUT

67
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:30,044
HOW COMEY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED

68
00:02:30,044 --> 00:02:31,913
FOR LEAKING CONFIDENTIAL

69
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:32,346
INFORMATION.

70
00:02:32,346 --> 00:02:35,383
NONE MUCH THAT IS COVERED TODAY.

71
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,618
BUT THE ONLY THING THEY COVER IS

72
00:02:37,618 --> 00:02:39,620
STORMY, STORMY AND EVEN GOT THAT

73
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:39,954
WRONG.

74
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:42,556
>> WELL, SEAN, THEY ARE INVESTED

75
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:43,724
IN IT NOW.

76
00:02:43,724 --> 00:02:52,133
THEY CAN'T GET AWAY FROM THE

77
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:52,566
RUSSIA HOAX.

78
00:02:52,566 --> 00:02:53,200
AND SOLD IT FOR A YEAR.

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,901
THIS IS A CASE BUILT BY LIAR

80
00:02:53,901 --> 00:02:54,302
ACCIDENT.

81
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:55,069
CLAPPER AND BRENNAN AND COMEY.

82
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:57,104
THEY BUILT IT ON A BED OF LIES

83
00:02:57,104 --> 00:03:02,843
FOR LIARS ON CAPITAL AND PEOPLE

84
00:03:02,843 --> 00:03:05,413
IN THE MEDIA WHO OBTRUKTED THE

85
00:03:05,413 --> 00:03:06,414
TRUMP PRESIDENCY.

86
00:03:06,414 --> 00:03:08,716
LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN I WAS

87
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,518
A SECRET SERVICE AGENCY.

88
00:03:10,518 --> 00:03:13,120
I WENT TO AN ADVANCED

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,155
INTERROGATION SCHOOL.

90
00:03:14,155 --> 00:00:00,000
ONE OF THE THINGS THEY TAUGHT
