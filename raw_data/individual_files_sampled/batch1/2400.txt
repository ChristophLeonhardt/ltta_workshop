you had started bridgewater you'd had many years of being very successful you'd gotten very confident and you've made this huge controversial bet that we were headed into a next Great Depression and Nan right the debt the defaults came Mexico defaulted in August 1982 I thought wow we're gonna go in this crisis and everything was gonna fall apart and that was the exact bottom of the stock market like I couldn't have been more wrong and it was painfully wrong because I'd built the company up until that point we had we're a tight group of a small group of people I had to let everybody grow I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad I had testified to Congress because they asked me to explain this I had been on Wall Street we call all of those mistakes and it was very painful experience and it turned out to be probably the best experience of my life because it changed my attitude about thinking in other words rather than thinking I'm right I went to thinking how do I know I'm right and it created this open-mindedness it to be able to then go find the smartest people who disagreed with me and to see how they would think about things to be route balanced my bets better it taught me a radical open-mindedness it taught me what you're referring to in the beginning of the book that I'm trying to convey that the power of radical open-mindedness and an idea meritocracy is such a powerful thing and you talk a lot about how this process of pain and I can imagine that was just again a gut wrenching experience if have to fire all of your friends you have to rebuild from zero you start going forward you have to look in the mirror and say hey I was way too arrogant and confident I have to relearn that's not an easy thing to do right I have a saying pain plus reflection equals progress right and I began to develop this knee-jerk reaction if on pain is a signal that something is wrong that you did something wrong if you make those mistakes and then to take that pain and to calm oneself down and think what would I have done differently the future so my instincts change I view those experiences now like solving puzzles that will give me gems the puzzle is what would I do differently in the future so I would get a better result the gem is the principle that I would write down as I learned it so literally by writing down the principle when this one comes along what do I do with it there everything is another one of those like we have a million more those yes and if you start to say when one of those comes along how should I bets deal with it and you write down that recipe those are the principles so I found that exercise to be great and I also found that I could turn those principles into algorithms so let's say our investment process those criteria are built into literally algorithms and data can come in so I found that process of encountering pain to produce reflection to produce better ways of doing it to principles and then carrying that forward to decision-making has been invaluable and to do that with people who are going to disagree with me and to know how to do that well that's then the key to success
