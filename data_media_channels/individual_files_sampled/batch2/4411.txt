joining me now Shawn Henry former FBI Executive Assistant Director in an MSNBC cybersecurity and national security analyst Shawn always good to see I want to get right to it here because I'm curious the serious nature of this hacking threat to u.s. election systems where are these systems vulnerable well Alex these systems are somewhat to sperrit we have a decentralized election process in this country you've got state local and federal election processes and you've got to think about leading up to the actual election all the many months and even years of work that's being done by campaigns then you've got the actual PACs that are involved you've got the day-to-day voting on Election Day and then post the election you've got all the processing and the tallying of the votes so this is a widely disparate process that being said the Department of Homeland Security has recently designated our election process as critical infrastructure critical infrastructure being those systems and networks that are so vital to the American Way of life that if they were somehow attacked or disrupted they would have a significant impact on national security so the the threat is real and it goes beyond nation-states there are a lot of organizations entities adversaries that are looking to disrupt our way of life Alex so Shawn a Microsoft executive was telling the Aspen security forum that his company dealt with attacks on 3 2018 election campaigns is this problem 2 and dim it's intimidating for the smaller campaigns and should the government get more involved in trying to protect the candidates well I've got to tell you though we've heard just in in 2016 about election issues this goes back many years back in 2008 when I was in the FBI and the cyber division there was an attack by China against both the Obama and the McCain campaign so this is something that's been going on for over a decade I think that when we think about the capabilities of adversaries what their tools and tactics are what their specific motivations are that it absolutely goes above and beyond the capabilities and the expertise of some of these smaller entities when you think about counties and local organizations and that the ability of the United States government with its many resources and its expertise they can add a lot of value to hell protect that critical election process so deputy AG rod Rosenstein has announced a DOJ plan to battle election hacking there are six major threats in his mind and I'm gonna go through them here direct damage to computer systems data theft fraud schemes extortion blackmail attacks on critical infrastructure and maligned foreign influence operations your assessment on that is he spot-on with the target theorem would that make a dent on the volume of attacks expected as the midterms roll around if they do invest in trying to foil anything from these sources well I think the Deputy Attorney General is spot on in terms of the type of threats and he's talking specifically about elections this is such a much broader issue against all critical infrastructure electric power and energy water etc in talking about specifically the elections the US government has a lot that they can bring to bear against these multiple adversaries first they can bring intelligence that they've collected to make people aware the late local agencies about who the particular actors are what types of things they should be looking for they can also provide expertise in terms of incident response training and the like at the end of the day unfortunately the government is not putting up sensors in the ISPs that are blocking all the malicious traffic the local agencies are going to be responsible for deploying technology and actually detecting and disrupting these specific threats themselves there's an awful lot the government can do a lot more it's going to require a comprehensive process across all the agencies in the US government government bringing our resources to bear against this most significant threat to our democracy yeah in less than four months to get it done in terms of the midterms all right Shawn Henry thank you so much hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
