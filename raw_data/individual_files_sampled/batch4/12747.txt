huzza right don't say I just want to read the chyron right this is earlier this was earlier yesterday it says CNN exclusive undisclosed email shall follow up after Don Jr meeting with Russians at Trump Tower but the follow-up didn't actually have anything bad to that either there's no evidence that any follow-up was even responded to by the Trump people so everything that CNN is reporting and when you watch CNN half their coverage is about Russia's stuff they're not only is there no smoking gun there is no bullet there's no gun like we I don't even know what these stories are supposed to be proving when they're this bad and then they and then again it's amazing to me people are wondering how could it possibly be how can it possibly be that people don't trust the mainstream media this is why people don't trust the mainstream media seriously
