I feel so awkward and weird inside
baby goes back inside
I feel kind of creeped out by that song
a little bit I don't know about inside
voice when I get inside and use my
inside voice it makes me feel
uncomfortable a little bit like that's
like the worst song you could ever
possibly play on a date like hell no
yeah I feel that
I'd be fist bumping a brave late at
night I like listening to like club
music that you want to like really
party - like I like party music so 10
out of 10 be like almost Coldplay
so great
when that first came in it's kind of
like felt like almost the same notes of
clocks and then it just like veered off
into musical theater zone like the lead
character in the musical is like
pondering life I would never personally
listen to that I'm just thinking about
this girl called Bonnie with her tits
out I was kind of like not expecting
there to be that kind of strum me guitar
thing happening
it's Plain White T's oh I didn't really
I would never have thought that this was
the Plain White T's ever
I feel like hey there Delila it was kind
of like a bit of her like anomaly in
their sound like it blew up and everyone
was like oh the hey there Delila guy is
like really soft like but that's not
really them right I feel like there are
a lot harder IRL don't stereotype The
Plain White T's you know because they're
not just hey there Delila there are
other too guys
you
you
