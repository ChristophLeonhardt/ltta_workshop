THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HAS ALREADY PASSED ITS VERSION
OF WHAT THEY WILL CALL TAX
REFORM, BUT IN REALITY IT IS A
$1.5 TRILLION TAX CUT FOR THE
WEALTHY.
THEY STILL HAVE A LONG
WAY TO GO TO PASS THIS,
OBVIOUSLY THE SENATE HAS TO PASS
ITS OWN VERSION AND THEY HAVE TO
RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES,
HOWEVER HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW SO
FAR ABOUT THE HOUSE VERSION OF
THE BILL THAT AGAIN PASSED BY A
VOTE OF 227 TO 205 --
THEY ARE HOPING THIS WILL BE
SOMETHING THAT CAN COME TO A
VOTE IN CONGRESS BEFORE
CHRISTMAS, SO AFTER
THANKSGIVING.
SENATOR RON WYDEN,
A DEMOCRAT, HAD A GREAT QUOTE
THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU
BEFORE WE 
GET INTO THE DETAILS
--
AND HE IS NOT WRONG --
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE,
REMEMBER, AS IT IS IT'S NOT REALLY
35%.
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE
CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES IT'S
SOMEWHERE AROUND 17%.
SO FROM
WHAT I'VE SEEN THERE IS VERY
LITTLE EMPHASIS, IF ANY AT ALL,
ON DOING AWAY WITH THOSE
LOOPHOLES OR DEDUCTIONS, BUT
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS
REGARDING LOWERING THE TAX RATES
FOR THESE CORPORATIONS.
IT ALSO
COLLAPSES THE NUMBER OF TAX
BRACKETS FROM SEVEN TO FOUR --
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T
LIVE IN A STATE THAT HAS ESTATE
TAXES OR CERTAIN LOCAL TAXES, OR
THOSE LOCAL TAXES ARE SUPER LOW
AND YOU AREN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT,
PEOPLE LIVING IN HIGH TAX STATES
LIKE CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK WILL
BE ABLE TO DEDUCT THOSE STATE
TAXES WHEN THEY FILE THEIR
TAXES.
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE
VERY FEW DEDUCTIONS THAT THE
MIDDLE CLASS GETS TO TAKE ANY
ADVANTAGE OF. AND THEY WANT TO
DO AWAY WITH THAT.
THAT IS THE
REASON WHY 13 REPUBLICANS
ACTUALLY VOTED AGAINST THE HOUSE
VERSION OF THIS BILL.
A BIG PART OF THE NEW YORK
DELEGATION.
LAWMAKERS IN NEW JERSEY AND
NEW YORK WERE LIKE, NO,
THIS WILL HURT MY CONSTITUENTS,
I'M NOT SIGNING ONTO THIS.
THIS WILL HAVE A HARD TIME IN
THE SENATE, POLITICAL REALITY,
BUT SOMETHING IS WHEN TO HAPPEN.
WHEREVER THE U.S. CENTERS ARE
RIGHT NOW THAT AREN'T TALKING
ABOUT AL FRANKEN, THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT THIS.
THEY WANT
SOME KIND OF A DEAL, THEY WANT
SOMETHING.
THEY WANT TO VOTE ON
SOMETHING BEFORE THANKSGIVING SO
THEY CAN GO BACK OVER THE
HOLIDAYS AND SAY WE GOT
SOMETHING.
THEY WILL GET SOMETHING IN
THERE, OUT OF THE SENATE,
I'M GUESSING TONIGHT OR
TOMORROW.
SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT OF IT
WILL LIKELY BE VOTED UPON IN THE
SENATE AND PASSED, YOU ARE
SAYING?
SOMETHING THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
PASS.
AND I WOULD IMAGINE THE
REST OF IT THEY WOULD COME BACK
AFTER THANKSGIVING AND YOU WILL
HAVE VOTES IN THE SENATE FOR A
WEEK STRAIGHT, JUST POWER VOTES.
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO MAKE
YOU AWARE OF, THEY WILL TRY TO
SELL THIS AS A TAX CUT FOR
EVERYONE, THE MIDDLE CLASS, YOU
WILL GET MAJOR TAX CUTS --
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IN FACT SOME OF
THESE PERSONAL DEDUCTIONS PEOPLE
CAN TAKE -- LET ME REPHRASE
THIS, COMPONENTS OF THIS THAT
COULD POTENTIALLY GIVE YOU A
LITTLE BIT OF A TAX CUT WOULD
SUNSET IN 10 YEARS.
SO IN 10
YEARS YOUR TAXES WILL GO UP
ASTRONOMICALLY.
BUT EVEN IN THE
PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN, YOUR
TAXES ARE LIKELY TO GO UP AS
WELL.
LET ME EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU
-- AND BY THE WAY, THAT IS BASED
ON THE HOUSE VERSION AS IT
STANDS RIGHT NOW.
THINGS COULD
CHANGE, WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY
WILL, BUT HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW.
THIS IS A FOCUS ON THE SENATE'S
VERSION, WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT
ON YESTERDAY'S SHOW --
THAT IS BECAUSE CERTAIN
THINGS WOULD SUNSET OR THEY
WOULD ESSENTIALLY EXPIRE IN 10
YEARS THAT WOULD HELP THE MIDDLE
CLASS MAYBE SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
MONEY IN TAXES --
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT
NOW.
AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF
EMPHASIS ON HELPING OUT
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS,
LOWERING THE TAX RATE FOR THESE
CORPORATIONS, NOT A LOT OF
EMPHASIS ON HELPING THE LITTLE
GUY, BUT WHEN THEY DO THEIR
MARKETING THEY MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
THEY MARKET THIS AS A
MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT, WE
MENTIONED ON THE SHOW I THINK
LAST WEEK THAT THEIR VERSION OF
THE MIDDLE CLASS NOW IS $450,000
PER YEAR.
THAT IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO
HEAR THE RHETORIC OF THIS BILL
SAY THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE
WRONG MONIKER TO USE NOW, THAT
THEY SHOULD CALL IT
WORKING-CLASS.
BECAUSE
MIDDLE-CLASS DOESN'T RESONATE
THE SAME WAY IT DOES, IF YOU ARE
OUT TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS YOU
ARE HELPING WEALTHIER PEOPLE
BECAUSE OF WHAT THE
REPUBLICAN ARE DOING.
SO TO CALL IT THE WORKING CLASS
MAY BE A BETTER WAY FORWARD.
THE WORKING CLASS WILL BE
ORPHANED BY THIS, AND AS ANA
SAYS THE CORPORATE TAX CUT IS
HUGE, AND THESE PARADISE PAPERS
THAT SHOWED THAT THESE
CORPORATIONS ARE PARKING
TREMENDOUS MOUNT OF MONEY
OFFSHORE, AND GETTING THESE TAX
BREAKS -- THOSE ARE THE
COMPANIES THAT NEED AN
ADDITIONAL TAX BREAK?
THE WHOLE
THING IS ABSURD.
ALL YOU HAVE EVER DONE IS LOSE
MONEY OFFSHORE.
IT'S CRAZY, AND I THINK YOU
ARE RIGHT, MICHAEL, I THINK
SOMETHING WILL COME OUT OF THIS,
I THINK THEY ARE DESPERATE TO
MAKE A DEAL.
AND KEEP IN MIND, I
THINK THAT IT'S MOSTLY
REPUBLICANS, YES, THAT WANT TO
CUT TAXES, BUT THERE ARE
DEMOCRATS ON BOARD AS WELL.
AND
RIGHT NOW THE SENATE DOESN'T
NEED MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO
PEOPLE WILLING TO SIGN ON
TO TAX CUTS.
AND PREVIEWING A REPUBLICAN
ADMINISTRATION, REPUBLICAN
PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN CONGRESS,
IF THIS IS ALL THEY GET GOING
INTO THANKSGIVING, AND I KNOW
THIS IS SERIOUS AND THIS IS BIG,
BUT IF YOU REWIND TO BEFORE THE
SUMMER, OH MY GOD, THIS IS WHAT
THEY WILL DO TO OBAMACARE, ON
TAXES, TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL,
ALL THESE THINGS, AND ALL THEY
GO HOME WITH IS A BITE FROM A
BILL THAT CAME OUT AT THE LAST
MINUTE BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS, IT
HAS TO BE SEEN, EVEN THOUGH THE
LEGISLATION ITSELF IS TERRIBLE,
BUT THE POLITICAL REALITY IS
THAT IT HAS TO BE SEEN AS
SOMETHING OF A VICTORY BY THE
OPPOSITION PARTY IN CONGRESS, TO
ONLY HAVE THIS BE WHAT CAME OUT.
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
PEOPLE WANT, TAX CUTS FOR THE
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS IS
ABHORRENT TO SO MANY
PEOPLE, BUT THEY PLAYED PRETTY
GOOD DEFENSE, I HAVE TO SAY.
THAT'S TRUE, FLYING UNDER THE
BANNER OF SO MUCH OF WHAT THEY
WANTED TO DO, THEY WILL HE
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET A LOT
OF THINGS DONE.
BUT THAT SAID,
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ABLE TO
GET DONE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS,
HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO UNWIND A
BUNCH OF STUFF.
THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THOUGH
HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
