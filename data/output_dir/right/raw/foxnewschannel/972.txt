1
00:00:01,306 --> 00:00:02,507
TO MIGRANTS WHO FEARED GANG

2
00:00:02,507 --> 00:00:03,975
VIOLENCE OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN

3
00:00:03,975 --> 00:00:04,709
THEIR HOME COUNTRIES.

4
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:07,745
IT TURNED OUT THAT THE MAJORITY

5
00:00:07,745 --> 00:00:09,614
OF THOSE APPLICATIONS WERE

6
00:00:09,614 --> 00:00:11,416
FALSE.

7
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:12,283
MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL JOINS US

8
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:12,650
TONIGHT.

9
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,019
SO, I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS.

10
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:15,753
BUT FIRST I HAVE TO ASK YOU

11
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:19,657
ABOUT A PIECE OF BREAKING NEWS.

12
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:20,358
CATHERINE HERRIDGE JUST SAID

13
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:23,528
THAT IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR,

14
00:00:23,528 --> 00:00:24,696
JANUARY 10, DEPUTY

15
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:26,197
GENERAL ROSENSTEIN WENT UP AND

16
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:28,199
MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE

17
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,434
INTEL COMMITTEE, HAD A DISPUTE

18
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:30,435
WITH THEM AND THREATENED THEM

19
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:32,436
WITH A SUBPOENA OF THEIR EMAILS

20
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:33,838
AND PHONE RECORDS.

21
00:00:33,838 --> 00:00:35,006
THIS IS WHAT ONE OF THEM SAID

22
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:37,842
IT, I READ IT AS A NOT SO VEILED

23
00:00:37,842 --> 00:00:39,043
THREAT TO RELEASE FULL

24
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:40,445
PROSECUTORIAL POWER OF THE STATE

25
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:41,646
AGAINST US.

26
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:42,847
THE DOJ BACKGROUND HAS CONFIRMED

27
00:00:42,847 --> 00:00:43,982
THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS DID

28
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:45,249
HAPPEN.

29
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:46,551
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

30
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,720
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE

31
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,088
CONFIRMED THAT EXACTLY.

32
00:00:50,088 --> 00:00:53,725
IN FACT, THE FBI DIRECTOR, THE

33
00:00:53,725 --> 00:00:56,427
SENIOR EFFECTS COMMITTEE SAY

34
00:00:56,427 --> 00:00:58,830
THAT IS A MISCHARACTERIZATION,

35
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,431
REALLY, OF WHAT OCCURRED.

36
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:02,633
ALSO, I THINK IT INDICATES THAT

37
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,635
THERE HAS BEEN A BREAKDOWN OF

38
00:01:04,635 --> 00:01:07,505
RELATIONSHIPS, WHEN IN FACT,

39
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:09,607
SINCE JANUARY, A GREAT DEAL OF

40
00:01:09,607 --> 00:01:11,309
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE.

41
00:01:11,309 --> 00:01:12,243
WE UNDERSTAND IN THIS DEPARTMENT

42
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:18,249
THAT WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO

43
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:19,417
CONGRESS AND WE NEED TO BE

44
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,019
COOPERATIVE WITH THEM, TO

45
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,687
PRODUCE AS MANY DOCUMENTS AS

46
00:01:22,687 --> 00:01:25,023
RATIONALLY, LEGALLY AND PROPERLY

47
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:29,027
AS CAN BE PRODUCING THEM, AND WE

48
00:01:29,027 --> 00:01:29,794
HAVE MADE DRAMATIC PROGRESS IN

49
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:35,400
THAT REGARD REALLY.

50
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,034
>> Tucker: DID THE DEPUTY

51
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:36,801
ATTORNEY GENERAL THREATENED TO A

52
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,236
SUBPOENA ON THE EMAIL OR PHONE

53
00:01:38,236 --> 00:01:41,005
RECORDS OF MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE

54
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:41,506
INTEL COMMITTEE?

55
00:01:41,506 --> 00:01:43,241
I WAS NOT IN THE ROOM AND I

56
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:45,009
CANNOT SPEAK TO WHAT OCCURRED.

57
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:47,845
ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE

58
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:49,414
PEOPLE -- THE DIRECTOR OF THE

59
00:01:49,414 --> 00:01:50,381
FBI AT OUR SENIOR ETHICS

60
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:52,850
ATTORNEY WAS THERE AND OTHERS

61
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,920
AND THEY DID NOT SEE THAT IN THE

62
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,354
SAME FASHION.

63
00:01:56,354 --> 00:01:58,423
>> Tucker: SO AS A FACTUAL

64
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:01,192
MATTER, YOU DON'T THINK THAT

65
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:01,826
HAPPENED?

66
00:02:01,826 --> 00:02:04,629
>> I'M CONFIDENT THAT DEPUTY

67
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:05,997
ROSENSTEIN AFTER 28 YEARS AND

68
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:08,466
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DID

69
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,199
NOT IMPROPERLY THREATEN ANYONE

70
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,402
ON THAT OCCASION.

71
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:13,504
BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE

72
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:16,240
TRIED TO BE COOPERATIVE WITH

73
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,742
THEM AND MADE PROGRESS IN

74
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:21,612
MONTHS, AS THE MONTHS HAVE GONE

75
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:21,879
BY.

76
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:23,981
IN FACT, WE HAVE HAD SOME GOOD

77
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:25,716
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MEMBERS

78
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:26,818
OF CONGRESS.

79
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:27,418
IT'S.

80
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:28,419
>> Tucker: OKAY.

81
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,755
SO YOU HAVE MADE NEWS RECENTLY

82
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:32,056
BY UNDOING AN OBAMA ERA RULE

83
00:02:32,056 --> 00:02:35,626
ABOUT ASYLUM-SEEKERS.

84
00:02:35,626 --> 00:02:37,028
GIVE US THE OVERVIEW.

85
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:37,962
I THINK MOST AMERICANS LIKE THE

86
00:02:37,962 --> 00:02:39,697
IDEA THAT THIS CAN BE A HAVEN

87
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:40,865
FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING AROUND THE

88
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:41,866
WORLD.

89
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,201
LOTS OF PEOPLE CLAIM ASYLUM,

90
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,602
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE

91
00:02:44,602 --> 00:02:48,039
VERACITY OF THEIR CLAIMS?

92
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,641
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

93
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:53,811
SEVEN YEARS AGO, 5,000 PEOPLE

94
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:55,746
APPLIED FOR ASYLUM CLAIMING A

95
00:02:55,746 --> 00:02:57,315
CREDIBLE FEAR OF BEING AT HOME

96
00:02:57,315 --> 00:03:00,051
IN THEIR HOME COUNTRY, AND THEY

97
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:02,053
NEEDED TO FLEE THAT COUNTRY.

98
00:03:02,053 --> 00:03:06,457
THAT NUMBER JUMPED TO 94,000 IN

99
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:07,258
JUST SEVEN YEARS.

100
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,827
IT IS OVERWHELMING OUR SYSTEM.

101
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:11,629
OVER 80% OF THOSE CLAIMS ARE

102
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:14,432
BEING DENIED BY THE IMMIGRATION

103
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:16,033
JUDGES AS BEING NOT MERITORIOUS.

104
00:03:16,033 --> 00:03:19,203
SO IT IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR US.

105
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:19,937
EACH ONE OF THOSE IS REQUIRING

106
00:03:19,937 --> 00:03:22,640
TRIALS AND FACTUAL DECISIONS BY

107
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,774
OUR JUDGES.

108
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:27,044
WE ARE GOING TO ADD 100 JUDGES,

109
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:30,214
AND THAT MAY YET NOT BE ENOUGH

110
00:03:30,214 --> 00:03:31,415
JUDGES TO HANDLE THE CASES.

111
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:34,585
WE NEED TO GET THE JUDGE IS

112
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:38,823
BETTER GUIDANCE, GO BACK TO THE

113
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:41,225
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES, LAWS AND

114
00:03:41,225 --> 00:03:42,226
RULES OF THE IMMIGRATION AND

115
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:42,760
NATIONALIZATION ACT.

116
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,662
IF WE DO THAT, THEN WE ARE IN A

117
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:46,230
POSITION WHERE SOME OF THESE

118
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,232
CASES CAN BE PROMPTLY DECIDED.

119
00:03:48,232 --> 00:03:49,667
WE DO NOT GET TO COME TO AMERICA

120
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:57,108
IF YOU HAVE A PRIVATE THREAT OR

121
00:03:57,108 --> 00:03:58,242
SOMEONE PERSONALLY ATTACKS YOU.

122
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:00,144
YOU DO NOT GET TO HAVE ASYLUM

123
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:02,013
FOR THAT, BASED ON YOUR RACE,

124
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:04,582
RELIGION OR NATIONALITY, THAT

125
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,417
YOU ARE PART OF SOME SPECIAL

126
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:07,952
IDENTIFIABLE GROUP THAT HAS BEEN

127
00:04:07,952 --> 00:04:10,988
PERSECUTED IN YOUR HOME COUNTRY.

128
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:14,158
THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO HAVE

129
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:15,993
ASYLUM AND I THINK IT WILL HELP

130
00:04:15,993 --> 00:04:16,627
US.

131
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:19,163
AT THE DECISION I MADE, I

132
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:21,065
BELIEVE IT'S RIGHT LEGALLY AND

133
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:22,233
I'M TOTALLY CONFIDENT IT'S

134
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:24,235
CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF

135
00:04:24,235 --> 00:04:26,504
THE DRAFTERS OF THE INA, OUR

136
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:27,038
LAW.

137
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:29,273
I BELIEVE IT WILL HELP US MANAGE

138
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:30,007
OUR CASELOADS BETTER AND GIVE

139
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:31,943
MORE FOCUS TO THE PEOPLE WHO

140
00:04:31,943 --> 00:04:35,246
DESERVE TO BE GIVEN ASYLUM AND

141
00:04:35,246 --> 00:04:37,448
HELP US ELIMINATE THOSE WHO ARE

142
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:38,482
NOT WORTHY OF THE ASYLUM.

143
00:04:38,482 --> 00:04:40,918
>> Tucker: WITH OVER 80% OF

144
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:42,920
THE APPLICATIONS ARE FRAUDULENT,

145
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,424
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A PROBLEM.

146
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:47,124
SO THEY HAVE ALSO RECENTLY

147
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:49,994
WEIGHED IN WITH THE QUESTION OF

148
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:51,429
SPEECH ON CAMPUS.

149
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:52,096
WHAT CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF

150
00:04:52,096 --> 00:04:53,130
JUSTICE DO TO ENSURE THAT

151
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,399
PEOPLE'S FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS

152
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:55,866
ARE PROTECTED?

153
00:04:55,866 --> 00:04:59,503
AND WHY HAS IT TAKEN UNTIL 2018

154
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:01,239
TO GET THE DOJ INVOLVED?

155
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,473
>> IT'S ONE OF THE BIG

156
00:05:02,473 --> 00:05:03,941
CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME, I HAVE

157
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:06,244
COME TO BELIEVE, AND IT'S ALMOST

158
00:05:06,244 --> 00:05:08,279
UNBELIEVABLE THAT MAJOR COLLEGES

159
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,047
AND UNIVERSITIES WILL BE TAKEN

160
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:11,048
ACTION THAT RESTRICTS THE RIGHT

161
00:05:11,048 --> 00:05:14,185
OF FREE SPEECH ON A COLLEGE

162
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:16,621
CAMPUS.

163
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:18,189
WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY ON THE LAW

164
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:22,627
TO FILE A STATEMENT OF INTEREST

165
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:23,628
IN ONGOING LITIGATION.

166
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:25,296
SO CASES ARE BEING FILED AGAINST

167
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:27,131
THE UNIVERSITIES BY STUDENTS WHO

168
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,498
COMPLAIN.

169
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:31,035
IF WE THINK THE COMPLAINTS ARE

170
00:05:31,035 --> 00:05:33,838
MERITORIOUS, THEN WE CAN FILE A

171
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:34,805
STATEMENT OF INTEREST JOINING

172
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:39,443
WITH THEM, AND EXPLAIN WHY WE AT

173
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:40,678
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THINK

174
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:45,283
THESE CONCERNS ARE REAL AND

175
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:55,426
JUSTIFIED, AND COURT RELIEF IS

176
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:55,826
APPROPRIATE.

177
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:56,460
WE HAVE HAD SOME SUCCESS.

178
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,128
WE HAVE HAD TWO CASES WHERE

179
00:05:57,128 --> 00:05:57,862
THERE HAS BEEN A MAJOR CHANGE IN

180
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:58,529
THE COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY'S

181
00:05:58,529 --> 00:05:59,263
ACTIONS, AND TWO CASES WHERE THE

182
00:05:59,263 --> 00:05:59,997
JUDGE HAS DISMISSED OR REJECTED

183
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:01,365
A MOTION TO DISMISS THESE CASES

184
00:06:01,365 --> 00:06:04,268
BY THE UNIVERSITIES, AND

185
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:05,803
ALLOWING THE TRIAL TO GO

186
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:06,237
FORWARD.

187
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:09,373
WE THINK IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

188
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,409
THING.

189
00:06:11,409 --> 00:06:12,843
STUDENTS SHOULD BE PARTICIPATING
