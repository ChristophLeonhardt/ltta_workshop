now that Hillary Clinton has finally admitted she's a sick old woman about to be mercifully carried off by pneumonia many of you may have begun to ask yourself what will happen if the Democrat candidate for corrupt president becomes too ill to continue her campaign how will she be replaced if she steps down and what if she dies will she really have to go to hell for all eternity or is there some chance a fire hotter than a thousand suns will purge her desiccated soul of the blackness of her innumerable sins actually I can't answer that last question but I can't explain the Democratic National Committee's bylaws for how she can be replaced now first of all let me reassure those of you who don't wish Hillary dead and feel free to move in closer so you can hear me better that there is no evidence that Hillary is gravely ill as Jennifer Granholm Appert Lea tractive blonde woman who used to be governor of some way or other as she said powering through illness is just what women do and of course all men already know that because we're the ones who have to listen to all the complaining before going out to earn enough money to support the women while they're powering through or whatever the hell it is they do all day but in the event Hillary should Hillary should finally admit that let's face it she's heading off to that big Benghazi hearing in the sky the DNC's Charter and bylaws make it very clear what procedures must be followed according to DNC bylaw seventy eight point forty two section 53 quote should the essential corruption of a Democrat candidate begin to manifest itself in material form such that a physical cancer begins to mirror the spiritual cancer that has infested every corner of her being a series of meaningless meetings shall be convened while Barack Obama asks Valerie Jarrett what should happen next when Jarrett decides who should be the replacement candidate all committee members shall record their vote on a 3x5 index card which they shall then fold into a paper airplane to be thrown across the committee room whereupon who's whoever's plane flies furthest shall win a free trip on the lolita Express if male or a female and under 15 after the vote is taken Valerie Jarrett's candidate shall be added to the ballots in all 57 states in those states where the law forbids the addition of a candidate at this late date the Secretary of State in choice of enforcing that law shall mysteriously disappear in a van marked George Soros dry-cleaning service irritating wrinkles removed the local law shall then be deemed to have the same effect on the Democratic Party as the United States Constitution namely none and the candidate shall be declared president for life unquote Hillary Clinton has denied these measures will be needed telling reporters quote I am NOT leaving the race if dead men can vote for Democrats then why shouldn't den MIT dead men vote for dead Democrats now if you'll excuse me I'm late for my embalming unquote trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show alright Johnny got through that without laughing you know people blame me for laughing but I just I just want to take full responsibility of the fact it's J Hayes fault that he cracks up in then I crack up that's that's the way that worked all right a lot of stuff to talk about more fallout from all this health stuff and some cultural observations after a really interesting evening of football last night where Colin Kaepernick carried out his threat not to stand during the national anthem which I know he'd done in preseason but now it's the real season first of all you can watch this if you are a subscriber you can now watch this entire thing on The Daily wire from beginning to end so that's what you get for your lousy eight bucks we've parsed that out now it's a buck 37 for me and then I think the rest goes to Shapiro but that's totally fair believe me so you can watch the whole thing if you're not a subscriber and you're watching on Facebook or YouTube after 15 minutes you're you'll go blind it's not it's not actually the picture cutting out is you you've lost your vision and you can only hear us on the daily wire or on iTunes or SoundCloud and if you subscribed you get to be in the mailbag which is tomorrow so please get your questions in for the mail value yes woohoo please get your

hear about I would like to hear about it so include that with your question this is also the last week to buy pre-order the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ my memoir of conversion if you pre-order it which you can only do till Friday I think then you can send me the receipt a Clavin at daily wire.com and I will sign a sticker to put in the book all right all this fallout over Hillary Clinton collapsing and now they say she has pneumonia who knows what it is since they lie all the time you can't tell you can't tell what they say you know you don't even want a doubter people have been writing to me all day yesterday people were writing to me what do you think she has like what do I look like a doctor I mean not only that if I were a doctor what I'd be saying is like I don't know she's not my patient you know it's like you know who knows I mean it could be pneumonia could be emphysema that has now become pneumonia could be like all kinds of different things anyway it's it's obviously got them agitated a former Democratic National Committee Chairman says President Barack Obama and the party's congressional leaders should immediately come up with a process to identify a potential successor candidate so that's Don Fowler who helmed the DNC from 95 to 97 he's saying that Ohio Ohio Governor Ted Strickland came out and said the Tim Kaine is a wonderfully prepared person to be vice president and to be President if that ever became necessary not that it would ever be the guy who of course made the biggest gaffe was our friend Bill Clinton I you know somewhere deep down I think Bill has a little bit of hostility to the idea of his wife becoming you know you know you want the wife to stay home you know make you a sandwich stay home you don't want to running off and becoming president even even if she is already sleeping with another woman you still know it's touchy you know there's a little hostility that's so she goes on television and this is almost what he says on CBS not quite but almost she's been well over there that's administered to me and all of her doctors rarely but on more than one occasion over the last for many many years the same sort of things happen to her when she just got severely dehydrated so so what he really said was frequently well not frequently rarely and they just cut out the Freak because they wanted you know the media they want to help us understand they don't know it's to make any mistakes to think that she's just constantly Keeling over falling down so Hillary like you remember the first scene of The Walking Dead the first episode of walking there were that half-eaten zombie crawls claws our way through the grass so Hillary did they got to the phone and called Anderson Cooper at CNN and defended herself from her husband I'm feeling so much better and obviously I should have gotten some rest sooner I probably would have been better off if I'd just pulled down my schedule on Friday but like a lot of people I just thought I could keep going forward and power through it and obviously that didn't work out so well let me ask you your husband said tonight in an interview with Charlie Rose and he said quote rarely on more than one occasion over the last many many years the same sort of things happen to her meaning you when she got severely dehydrated can you say how many times over the course of the last say five years you've been to hydrate and gotten dizzy I know you passed out hit your head back in 2012 which led to the concussion how often has this happened oh I think really only twice that I can recall you know it is something that has occurred a few times over the course of my life and you know I'm aware of it and usually can avoid it what happened yesterday was that I just was incredibly committed to being at the memorial as a senator on 9/11 this is incredibly personal to me and I could you know feel how hot and humid it was I felt overheated I decided that I did me to leave and as soon as I got into the air-conditioned van I cooled off I got some water and very quickly I felt better so she can't remember how many times she's fainted because she keeps falling over and hitting her head once twice a few times I don't know you know if I could even keep banging my head I wouldn't remember but I keep banging my head over the key phrase she uses in there is power through now I don't want to say that when I say the news media edits out things so that we don't you know make mistakes I don't want to say that they like share the talking points of the Democratic Party that they're all one group of people but the free beacon has put together this montage and this is all from yesterday of people see power through has this kind of feminist overtone because because women like to think of themselves powering through their their victims were putting up there terribly oppressing them but you know they they're sick they have to take care of the kids but they power through they love that image of themselves this is a big cell specially Democrat women knew we're all such terrible victims of the oppression of being female in the United States of America so they're all selling this this is wonderful the free beacon this is all from yesterday splice them all together she made a determination with her doctor that she would power through this she made a decision to just power through this we've decided to power through sometimes just power through this continue to power through what yes she tried to power through it she decided to power through it well you know Brooke she just wanted to power through she just wanted to power through her schedule she wanted to just power through and keep doing it desire to power through power through and get things done it she tried to power through it it was Hillary Clinton's decision essentially to power through or the candidate who famously wants to power through these things that she's gonna try and power through we say when you get a call just power through power through they thought she could power through they thought she could power through they thought that she could power through it wants to power through things at to that the powering through the Governor jennifer Granholm said women just powers through these things and I get it I try to power through all my illnesses that Hillary Clinton had a very busy day on Friday and she powered through that day she powered through powering through illness is what women do everyday she continued powering through I mean she powered through that week I'm gonna stir our through that was that was that was her way so let me see if I've got this right she was she was powering through Israel but she wasn't just an old woman falling on her face because she was too sick to walk it was powering through just like mother used to do but but even on the left even on the left there were people who are saying you know the this is it's not just the cover-up I mean it's not there so that the cover-up is worse than the crime it's that the cover-up is part of an endless series of cover-ups so maureen dowd total left in its total left-winger however maureen dowd i have to give her credit where she where credit is due I don't like her I don't like I don't know personally I don't her writing I think she just calls people's stupid names and they're suppose it's supposed to be funny I think she's been incredibly unfair to the right you know just not not even logically attacking them just kind of making fun of them for no reason at all but she has always been incredibly honest about the Clintons and it has cost her and so I admire her integrity on that when Bill Clinton was cheating and and abusing women and the feminists were going like oh you know that's that's fine it's wonderful when he does it Maureen Dowd stood up for her beliefs in her opinions and took them on and she took a lot of flack for it so megyn kelly had her on last night and this was her take on the whole thing they want us to give them the benefit of the doubt now that it really is pneumonia that they knew that since Friday that half the team has pneumonia have they earned it had the earned the benefit of the doubt the Clintons no and you know I agree with David Axelrod who said it isn't about the health it's about the stealth the health issue this week is a perfect microcosm of why she has problems and you know I spent the I started covering her in 92 when she first came on the scene just as I did Trump in 99 and that's why I thought you know I could give some context to this and this is the exact same pattern she follows every time where Trump has his wall and she has her wall of defensiveness and secretiveness and just pushing back the press can't know anything and each time it gets worse because that spirals into a snowball and her the press and Truffaut's get into a frenzy and then the whole thing is so much worse when it starts out as relatively mundane so that's that's pretty much I mean there's a lot of people saying that not just Axelrod and Dowd you know they're just saying like look you know this is what she does all the time with everything so how can you believe anything she says and why should anybody trust her and and the funny thing the really amazing thing is not that Hillary Clinton is acting like Hillary Clinton it's that Donald Trump isn't acting like Donald Trump Donald Trump has been incredibly denie plating for the big because when the the shoe drops with trumpet drops right into his mouth you know the time he's not doing it he is holding fire on this he's been very good about her help well I don't take satisfaction Joe and frankly you know I hope she gets well and hope she gets well soon but you know was it was quite sad to be honest with you and and I hope she gets well soon no satisfaction believe me whatsoever was interesting because they say pneumonia on Friday but she was coughing very very badly a week ago and even before that if you remember this wasn't the first time so it's very interesting to see what is going on I want her to get better I want her to get out there I look forward to seeing her in the debate I will say this I will be scheduling you know if you look at my scheduling and compared to anybody else's schedule it is not a contest so you know I I found the the whole challenge to be very invigorating because you know it's about make America great again that's what we're doing we're going to make America great again there's so many things so many things that can happen so he just slipped the stiletto in there but like you know you don't think of Trump that way is like the fine Italian hand you know coming up and just slipping the stool you know he said it basically said like I'm in great health I'm running around everywhere I had you know I can't my schedule is would kill would kill a lesser man you know getting these digs in but he's not saying that dumb thing and that is very impressive meanwhile he is also to the New York Times's dismay they ran a hilarious headline this morning you know the two New York Times dismay he's now going around and cramming this deplorable statement where she said half of Trump supporters are in a basket of deplorable he is cramming this down her throat and he's doing it while she's off the campaign trail cuz she's so sick she can't move so the New York Times says you know Trump moves to take advantage of her disappear like he's supposed to stand down and let everything pass but instead he goes out and he really gave it to her on the deplorable thing of our country I was thus deeply shocked and alarmed this Friday to hear my opponent attack slander smear demean these wonderful amazing people who are supporting our campaign by the myths our support comes from every part of America and every walk of life we have the support of cops and soldiers carpenters and welders the young and the old and millions of working-class families who just want a better future and a good job these were the people Hillary Clinton so viciously demonized these were among the countless Americans that Hillary Clinton called deplorable irredeemable and unamerican okay we were going to have a some really interesting conversation about the culture but we have to leave you on YouTube and Facebook so come on over to the daily wire and hear the rest
