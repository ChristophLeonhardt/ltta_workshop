1
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:05,108
WHO IS WHO IN THE CARAVAN.

2
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:06,175
THE PRESIDENT GENERATED

3
00:00:06,176 --> 00:00:06,843
CONTROVERSY WHEN HE SAID

4
00:00:06,844 --> 00:00:08,311
THERE WERE DEFINITELY MS-13

5
00:00:08,312 --> 00:00:10,113
AND OTHER ELEMENTS, ISIS

6
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:12,282
ELEMENTS WITHIN THE 7,000 HE

7
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:14,284
SAYS AS MUCH AS 10,000, AS

8
00:00:14,285 --> 00:00:16,319
MANY AS 10,000 MIGRANTS WHO

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,920
ARE MAKING THEIR WAY HERE TO

10
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:24,894
THE UNITED STATES, GUATEMALA

11
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:26,362
HONDURAS AND EL SALVADOR.

12
00:00:26,363 --> 00:00:27,497
THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY.

13
00:00:27,498 --> 00:00:28,898
WE HAVE SEEN NO WAY TO

14
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:31,000
VERIFY THE FACT THAT THERE

15
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,235
WERE MS-13 ELEMENTS OR

16
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:33,069
ANYTHING APPROACHING THAT

17
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:34,003
THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE IS

18
00:00:34,004 --> 00:00:35,138
NO PROOF OF ANYTHING WHICH

19
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:37,740
SEEMED TO REMOVE ANY OF THE

20
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:38,841
DOUBTS THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN

21
00:00:38,842 --> 00:00:40,343
ABOUT THE VERACITY OF THAT

22
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:40,710
STATEMENT.

23
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:42,945
WE HAVE SIMPLY NOT HEARD

24
00:00:42,946 --> 00:00:43,980
SEPARATE CONFIRMATION OF ANY

25
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:45,715
SUCH THING THAT THERE WERE

26
00:00:45,716 --> 00:00:47,784
ELEMENTS LIKE THAT WITHIN

27
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:50,253
THE 7,000 TO 10,000 MIGRANTS

28
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:52,388
WHO ARE MAKING THEIR WAY TO

29
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:53,289
THE UNITED STATES.

30
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,324
MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE

31
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,925
MAKE JUMP OF THIS CARAVAN

32
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:57,160
AND WHO IS IN IT, WHO IS NOT

33
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:57,760
IN IT.

34
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,462
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE THREE

35
00:00:59,463 --> 00:01:00,496
COUNTRIES IN QUESTION, THAT

36
00:01:00,497 --> 00:01:03,066
THEY ARE LARGELY THOSE

37
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,267
THREE, SOME MEXICANS COULD

38
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:08,137
BE ADDED.

39
00:01:08,138 --> 00:01:09,238
THERE IS OBLIGATION THE

40
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,406
PRESIDENT SAYS TO MAKE SURE

41
00:01:10,407 --> 00:01:11,441
THERE IS DUE PROCESS THERE

42
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:13,810
HE DID SAY THAT WE ALLOW

43
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:18,715
MANY INTO THIS COUNTRY 1

44
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:19,449
PULP 6 MILLION THE LEGAL

45
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:19,716
WAY.

46
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:21,084
THIS IS NOT THE WAY TO GO

47
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:22,251
ABOUT IT.

48
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:23,286
THESE ARE CASES THAT WOULD

49
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:24,654
BE TAKEN ON AN INDIVIDUAL

50
00:01:24,655 --> 00:01:25,188
BASIS.

51
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,589
THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE

52
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,191
ONCE THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM

53
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:29,926
STATUS COME INTO THE UNITED

54
00:01:29,927 --> 00:01:32,862
STATES, THEIR PAPERWORK IS

55
00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:33,229
PROCESSED.

56
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,497
THE RAP YOU HEAR FROM

57
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:36,265
CRITICS OF THIS SYSTEM THAT

58
00:01:36,266 --> 00:01:37,433
THAT ULTIMATELY THEY ARE

59
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:38,735
GIVEN A DATE TO COME BACK

60
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:39,802
AND RETURN TO COURT AND

61
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:41,437
STATE THEIR ASYLUM CASE.

62
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,639
BUT, BY THAT TIME, THEY HAVE

63
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,241
LONG SKIPPED TOWN AND THEY

64
00:01:45,242 --> 00:01:46,876
ARE IN THE UNITED STATES.

65
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,111
NOW, ANOTHER IDEA THAT'S

66
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,579
BEEN BAN TEED ABOUT THAT THE

67
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,847
PRESIDENT DIDN'T TOUCH ON IT

68
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,348
HERE OR ONE IDEA APPROACHED

69
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:53,850
THAT MAYBE THE MEXICANS HOLD

70
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,017
THEM UNTIL THEY ARE CLEARED

71
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:57,787
OR THEIR COURT DATES ARE

72
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:58,121
CLEARED.

73
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:59,188
I WANT TO STRESS HERE, THERE

74
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:00,289
HAS BEEN NO INDEPENDENT

75
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,125
CONFIRMATION OF SOME OF

76
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:03,760
THESE MIGRANTS BEING

77
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:06,696
TERRORISTS OR CERTAINLY

78
00:02:06,697 --> 00:02:09,132
PARTS OF MS-13 OR ANY OTHER

79
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:09,899
NEFARIOUS ELEMENT.

80
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,134
THERE IS SIMPLY NO WAY TO

81
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:12,268
PROVE THAT THE SUSPICIONS

82
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:13,469
NOT WITH STANDING,

83
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,370
SUSPICIONS ISN'T GOOD

84
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:14,704
ENOUGH.

85
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:15,471
THE PRESIDENT SAID AND I

86
00:02:15,472 --> 00:02:16,906
THOUGHT THIS WAS THE TAKE

87
00:02:16,907 --> 00:02:17,206
AWAY.

88
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,208
THERE IS NO PROOF OF

89
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:20,476
ANYTHING, WHICH IS NOT

90
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:22,412
EXACTLY A REASSURING COMMENT

91
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:23,980
TO MAKE WHEN YOU MAKE A

92
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:24,547
CHARGE LIKE THAT.

93
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:27,550
HAVING SAID THAT WHETHER

94
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,718
THERE ARE SUCH ELEMENTS

95
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:29,752
WITHIN THAT GROUP OR NOT.

96
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:33,022
THE QUESTION IS AND BECOMES

97
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:34,290
SUCH A LARGE GROUP COMING TO

98
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:36,592
OUR BORDER AND HOW WE DEAL

99
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:38,361
WITH THAT THAT IS A PROBLEM

100
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:38,795
RIGHT WALID.

101
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:40,496
>> IT IS A PROBLEM, OF

102
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:42,365
COURSE, THE SIGHT OF IT AND

103
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,866
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, THIS IS

104
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:44,467
NOT INDIVIDUALS COMING

105
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:45,535
THROUGH OUR BORDERS AND THEN

106
00:02:45,536 --> 00:02:47,503
WE NEED TO DO SOME VETTING

107
00:02:47,504 --> 00:02:48,738
THAT ALONE IS A HEADACHE.

108
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:50,640
THIS IS A SUPER HEADACHE.

109
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:50,907
WHY?

110
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:52,241
BECAUSE IN SECURITY

111
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:53,576
ASSESSMENT, IT'S NOT THE

112
00:02:53,577 --> 00:02:54,076
JUDICIAL CLEARING.

113
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:56,612
THE JUDICIAL CLEARING, YES,

114
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:57,346
DID YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE

115
00:02:57,347 --> 00:03:01,717
THAT THIS PERSON IS MS-13 OR

116
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:05,455
MS-13 HEZBOLLAH OR AL QAEDA,

117
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,456
NO SECURITIES ASSESSMENT

118
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:07,924
LOOK AT THE FRIEND.

119
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:08,724
MULTIPLE TRENDS HERE.

120
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:11,227
ALL THESE GANGS ACROSS THE

121
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:12,695
CENTRAL AMERICA AREA PLUS,

122
00:03:12,696 --> 00:03:14,030
IN ADDITION TO THE CARTELS

123
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,598
HAVE TRIED BEFORE FOR MANY,

124
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,199
MANY YEARS.

125
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,834
AND WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR

126
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:19,068
HEARINGS IN CONGRESS SO THE

127
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,303
TREND IS THERE NUMBER TWO,

128
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:21,137
THE VICE PRESIDENT SAID

129
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:22,104
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.

130
00:03:22,105 --> 00:03:24,273
HE SAID WE HAVE INFORMATION

131
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:26,075
FROM OUR ALLIES IN CENTRAL

132
00:03:26,076 --> 00:03:28,778
AMERICA THAT THE VENEZUELAN

133
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:30,880
REGIME, WITH WHOM WE ARE IN

134
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,548
CONFLICT RIGHT NOW OVER

135
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:33,883
MANY, MANY THINGS HAS BEEN

136
00:03:33,884 --> 00:03:35,017
PARTICIPATING IN PUSHING FOR

137
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:35,852
THIS DEMONSTRATION.

138
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,286
THAT, I WILL STOP AND SAY

139
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:38,754
WAIT A MINUTE, VENEZUELAN

140
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,289
REGIME THAT IS NOT

141
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:40,690
ASSESSMENT.

142
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,457
THIS IS INFORMATION WE HAVE

143
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,124
SPOKEN ABOUT.

144
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,493
AND VENEZUELA HAS AN

145
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:44,727
ALLIANCE WITH IRAN.

146
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:46,095
HAS AN ALLIANCE WITH

147
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:46,462
HEZBOLLAH.

148
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:47,597
THIS IS HOW THE SECURITY

149
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:48,764
ASSESSMENT WOULD SAY WE NEED

150
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:52,702
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

151
00:03:52,703 --> 00:03:53,102
SECURE.

152
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,270
>> Neil: JUST GETTING IT ON

153
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:56,138
A WHISPER AND QT FROM ALLIES

154
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:57,640
DOESN'T MAKE IT SO.

155
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:58,674
THIS IS NOT A NEW THING

156
00:03:58,675 --> 00:03:59,742
WHERE CARAVANS OF PEOPLE

157
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:02,778
HAVE TRIED TO COME IN USING

158
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:04,146
SHEAR NUMBERS TO TRY TO WALK

159
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:05,715
THROUGH TO THINK THEY HAVE

160
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:07,950
TO BE INSPIRED OR BROUGHT ON

161
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:09,585
BY NEFARIOUS ELEMENTS.

162
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:10,753
WHILE THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE

163
00:04:10,754 --> 00:04:11,521
WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE

164
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:12,421
PROOF OF THAT, DO WE?

165
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:13,456
>> I DON'T THINK I'M IN THE

166
00:04:13,457 --> 00:04:14,891
POSITION TO SAY WE HAVE THE

167
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:16,058
PROOF OR NOT, OUR

168
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,059
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES,

169
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,627
COUNTER INTELLIGENCE

170
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:18,661
AGENCIES ARE THE ONES WHO

171
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,794
SHOULD BE ACTUALLY INSIDE

172
00:04:19,796 --> 00:04:20,663
THE DEMONSTRATION.

173
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:24,300
THAT'S WHY YOU FELT

174
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:25,134
HESITATION ON BEHALF OF THE

175
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:26,035
PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT

176
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,403
TO GO IN DETAILS.

177
00:04:27,404 --> 00:04:28,471
IN THEIR SECURITY

178
00:04:28,472 --> 00:04:29,405
ASSESSMENT, I IMAGINE THEY

179
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:30,473
HAVE ASKED THE QUESTION TO

180
00:04:30,474 --> 00:04:31,274
OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

181
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,408
I IMAGINE THAT SOME ANSWERS

182
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,477
WERE MADE AVAILABLE.

183
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,278
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.

184
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,646
WALID, IN THE MEANTIME, YOU

185
00:04:36,647 --> 00:04:38,347
MIGHT BE OF THE IMPRESSION

186
00:04:38,348 --> 00:04:39,315
HEARING ALL OF THIS, THAT WE

187
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,149
ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE

188
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,217
BORDERS OF THIS COUNTRY,

189
00:04:41,218 --> 00:04:42,685
WHEN IN FACT, WE HAVE BEEN

190
00:04:42,686 --> 00:04:45,288
AVERAGING ANYWHERE FROM 1.1

191
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:45,988
TO 1.2 MILLION LEGAL

192
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:46,956
IMMIGRANTS INTO THIS COUNTRY

193
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:49,759
GOING THROUGH THE LEGAL

194
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,060
METHODS PER YEAR EVERY YEAR.

195
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,194
AND THIS HAS CONTINUED UNDER

196
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,462
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

197
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,364
SO ACTUALLY ACCELERATED A

198
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:56,098
LITTLE BIT.

199
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:57,199
SOMETIMES THERE IS THE

200
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,401
MISNOMER OUT THERE THAT WE

201
00:04:58,402 --> 00:04:59,402
ARE SHUTTING DOWN THE

202
00:04:59,403 --> 00:04:59,735
BORDER.

203
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:00,970
I'M WONDERING FROM YOUR

204
00:05:00,971 --> 00:05:01,904
VANTAGE POINT, DOES THIS

205
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,774
GIVE AN IMAGE THAT WE ARE

206
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:06,275
JUST TRYING TO POLICE PEOPLE

207
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:08,077
WE DON'T WANT OR PEOPLE WHO

208
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,278
ARE DOING IT THE WRONG WAY?

209
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:10,346
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

210
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,248
>> LOOK, MY FRIEND, I HAVE

211
00:05:12,249 --> 00:05:13,449
BEEN A LEGAL IMMIGRANT.

212
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,250
THAT'S HOW I CAME TO THE

213
00:05:14,251 --> 00:05:14,684
UNITED STATES.

214
00:05:14,685 --> 00:05:16,118
I WAS NOT BORN HERE.

215
00:05:16,119 --> 00:05:17,219
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF

216
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,955
PEOPLE LIKE ME CAME AND COME

217
00:05:18,956 --> 00:05:20,990
EVERY DAY TO THE UNITED

218
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:22,091
STATES THAT'S A NORMAL

219
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:22,391
THING.

220
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:23,292
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE

221
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:24,260
IS AN ORGANIZED MOVEMENT

222
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:25,394
WHICH BASICALLY IS NOT

223
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,197
HEEDING THE ADVICE OR

224
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:29,298
INSTRUCTION OF LET US DO THE

225
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,433
RIGHT THING, THE VETTING.

226
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:33,703
LET US CLEAR OUT THINGS THEY

227
00:05:33,704 --> 00:05:34,637
WANT TO GET TO THE BORDER

228
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,038
AND CROSS THE BORDER AND

229
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:37,073
PROVE IDEOLOGICAL POINT.

230
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:38,374
THAT IS SUSPICIOUS.

231
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,442
HAD THIS MOVEMENT, FOR

232
00:05:39,443 --> 00:05:41,344
EXAMPLE, ACCEPT YOU HAD THE

233
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:44,280
NOTION OF U.N. SPONSORED

234
00:05:44,281 --> 00:05:45,348
HUMAN ZONE NORTH OF

235
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:46,482
GUATEMALA OR SOUTH OF

236
00:05:46,483 --> 00:05:46,816
MEXICO.

237
00:05:46,817 --> 00:05:47,450
MANY RECOMMENDATIONS WERE

238
00:05:47,451 --> 00:05:48,384
MADE IN THAT DIRECTION.

239
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:49,885
THE ORGANIZERS REFUSED.

240
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:54,757
SO THEY DON'T HAVE.

241
00:05:54,758 --> 00:05:55,458
>> Neil: CARAVANS THEMSELVES

242
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,125
GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH THE

243
00:05:56,126 --> 00:05:57,460
SAME GOAL OF GETTING TO THE

244
00:05:57,461 --> 00:00:00,000
UNITED STATES OR INTO MEXICO
