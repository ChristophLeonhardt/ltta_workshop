THIS MORNING IT WAS REVEALED THAT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS IN THE US TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF A BEATING OVER THE NIGHT. THE LONG-STANDING TRADITION OF ALLOWING FREE ACCESS OF THE MEDIA TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS WAS SHUT DOWN. TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE SPECIAL PERMISSION LOOK LIKE. HER MOTHER, THEIR FATHER, GRANDMOTHER ñ THAT IS AN ISSUE. YOU MIGHT THINK I DON'T CARE IF THE MEDIA GETS INTERVIEWS. THAT'S FINE, BUT THIS WILL ALLOW SENATORS AND CONGRESSPEOPLE TO EVADE ANY SORT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THEY DO. WE ALREADY KNOW THEY ARE NOT DOING TOWN HALLS.SOMETIMES AMBUSHING THEM IN A HALLWAY IS THE ONLY WAY WE MAKE CLEAR WHAT THEY STAND FOR AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND MAKE SURE THERE IS SOME SORT OF CULPABILITY FOR WHAT THEY HAVE DONE. IT GOT EVEN DARKER DURING THE DAY. REPORTERS WERE CALLING IN TO FIND OUT WHY THEY WERE DOING THIS. LET'S LOOK AT THIS TWEET. THE WASHINGTON POST HAD A REPORTER WHO WAS ALSO HUNG UP ON. THANKFULLY THERE WAS IMMEDIATELY MASSIVE PUSHBACK FROM A LOT OF POLITICIANS, ALMOST UNIVERSALLY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THANKFULLY THEY HAVE DECIDED TO REVERSE THAT RULES CHANGE. SO THEY BOWED TO THE PRESSURE. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY DID. I LIKE MAKING COMPARISONS LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN TURNED ON THEIR HEAD THAT WE FORGOT TO THESE GUYS WORK FOR. IN A WAY WE ARE THEIR BOSS. WE AT LEAST HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL THEY ARE DOING. IT IS JUST THE WAY IT WORKS IN THE REAL WORLD. YOU CAN'T SAY NOBODY GETS TO MONITOR WHAT I AM DOING AFTER YOU HIRED ME. EXACTLY. THESE PEOPLE HAVE INCREDIBLE POWER TO INFLUENCE OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD. THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE GOING TO REDUCE TRANSPARENCY ñ WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP HATES THE MEDIA AND WANTS TO DO WHAT HE CAN TO CHANGE LIBEL LAWS. BUT THIS WAS SENATE REPUBLICANS TRYING TO MAKE THIS CHANGE. THINK ABOUT THE BIG VOTES THEY WILL TAKE IN THE NEAR FUTURE WHEN THEY VOTE ON TRUMP CARE AND STEEL HEALTH INSURANCE FROM AMERICANS. THEY DO NOT WANT A CAMERA IN THEIR FACE AFTER THEY CUT TAXES FOR CORPORATE AMERICA.
