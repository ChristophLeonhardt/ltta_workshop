hi my name is Linda I'm an activist from Brooklyn and I'm in the street I asked me okay and you're also in the stream we are live on our Syrah and YouTube today a radical history of Martin Luther King jr. where speak to those calling for a new retelling of the civil rights leaders life and work April the 4th marks 50 years since the assassination of the african-american civil rights leader he's best known I have a dream speech called for equality among blacks and whites in the US but how are historians and social justice activists today remembering the iconic figure especially in the current political climate joining us to discuss this in st. Louis Missouri Reverend osaki a folksy ku is an activists pastor musician and Aoife in Ithaca New York Russell Rickford professor of history at Cornell University he's also the author of we are an African people independent education black power and radical imagination in Chicago gen Jackson a doctoral candidate in black politics at the coordinates for Teen Vogue magazine and in San Francisco drew Dillinger an author and poet good to have you here everybody welcome great to see you let me show this with you be McNeil all that's taught about MLK for the most part are variations on the judge people by the content of their character not the color of their skin and that's important but by no means comprehensive do we have an MLK jr. problem Russell you teach students about him we absolutely have a I'm ok problem I think the problem is that we don't know any ok the man I think we know MLK the myth I think there's a manufactured King I like to call him King 2.0 rather than the original and I think that this King is a neutralized that pacified King it's a king that's really been concocted created to serve some very powerful interests and to obscure in many ways the the Democratic grassroots movement that actually produces King and some of the pressing social problems that he crusaded against throughout his life using this mythology this MLK dr. King mythology what's in it for you Jan yeah yes I couldn't so I actually 100% agree with professor I think that the big issue here is that we fail to acknowledge fully that during King's life he was really hated by a lot of kind of mainstream political leaders by FBI agents by the most of the kind of narratives that we're thinking about today in terms of colorblindness post-racialism a lot of that was leveraged against people like Martin Luther King jr. and so today when we're 50 years out from his assassination in a lot of cases we we had this kind of idyllic romanticized idea of who he was because that's a really more comfortable way of remembering him sometimes we call it whitewashed or we call it a more a more easy kind of learning right so it's very hard to learn that this person who was good at a Nobel Peace Prize was someone that was also hated and that had his home bombed after he had his first child right that's not a really good narrative about America but it is the truth and it's the real history behind MLK's legacy where every time I'm just thinking about you looking at another pasta and another pasta who was a radical and then seeing the way that he's remembered today does it great for you at all I think that part of our challenge with dr. King is that King is very much like Jesus in the sense of one of the most written about creatures in human history but perhaps one of the most misunderstood and in that King comes out of a particular tradition of the biblical narrative that takes seriously the humanity of black people in fact inside the context of the American Empire to believe that black people who are human is a revolutionary notion and King theology begins there this is what a black church begins and then for us to take seriously the ways in which he was not simply some kind of liberal who wanted everyone to tolerate everyone each other rather that he was a democratic socialism not as early as 1952 he writes a lot Coretta Scott King based on a socialist utopian novel written by and we're developing called lip green backward looking backwards and so she gives him this novel and he writes in his love letter to her that my thinking is more socialistic than it is capitalistic because he had seen the bread lines as a child during the Great Depression in the United States of America he agrees with the thought patterns of Edward Bellamy's novel and actually only believes and rightly so that Bellamy does not give capitalism enough time to die and so this is how he understands the gospel as a gospel that leads to a certain kind of finite political a.m. which is a democratic socialism and so also I think another great myth is that everybody over 40 March with King there's a mythology that we tell young people that every black church participated in the civil rights movement and the reality is between 1958 and 1961 he has to lead the National Baptist Convention and helped found the progressive Baptist Convention with 2000 other clergy because the vast majority of black churches at the time did not want to participate and then lastly August of 1966 his approval rating is at 12 percent the twelve percent of Americans agree with him in 1968 1966 just two years after he was received a Nobel Peace Prize and so I think this mythology is both that as dr. Richard has pointed out attempts to domesticate him in such a way that he folds neatly into an American Exceptionalist narrative which is just not true what made you go that little bit further deep dive and study dr. King well when I was in college I remembers twenty-five years ago and I believe it was the 25th anniversary of dr. King's assassination and I remember hearing Reverend Jesse Jackson on the radio and he said you know we think of King like he was a big civil rights teddy bear but this guy was radical and I remember being so struck by that because so that image of king is a civil-rights teddy bear so perfectly encapsulates this kind of superficial sentimentalized sterilized version of king that we've been given in mass media and so I began to delve into the speeches sermons and writings and I was inspired by Vincent Harding you know dr. Harding said that part of the problem with our public memory of King is that we freeze him on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in 1963 giving me I have a dream speech and we almost completely ignored the last five years of King's life in terms of our popular cultural memory and so that was a real impetus when I read dr. Harding in the mid 90s to say you know I need to really delve into the primary sources myself I need to read the speeches the sermons and the writings and as I did I was able to see very clearly what so many of these brilliant people on the panel and so many kings scholars have pointed out that there is a superficial King that we've been left with in terms of media and education a safe king a king you know there's reasons what the things that get left out aren't left out by accident no no because the United States does not want to deal with its systemic racists and white supremacy it's colonialism its imperialism its economic injustice so the things that are left out are you know not unintentional jank bad can I add to that as well yes I wanted to ask led to that thinking about Kings last book so thinking about where do we go from here chaos or community and how in this book he's explicitly anti-imperialist he's expensive explicitly anti-capitalist and a lot of this comes out of his witnessing our imperious efforts in the Vietnam War and how here we are in the u.s. fighting for freedom but it's kind of hypocrisy right it's this autocracy that we're taking democracy abroad to free people abroad meanwhile we have so many people in this country who don't have the freedom to actually move about in public in places where they actually have citizenship and so I actually 100% agree with this this kind of idea that there's ways where we have this example of King's legacy that is sanitized but I would say that this is a part of this kind of long history of anti-black and white supremacy and racism right because we know that racism will change itself it will transform itself in order to be more amenable to the current political time and so we have a more explicit moment the Jim Crow era right but we had this more implicit moment of racism where we see these forms of of watering down whitewashing sanitizing of a figure like King so that he becomes palatable for mainstream white Americans to be frank let me play this for you guess it's from April the 30th 1967 and dr. King was at the Riverside Church in New York and he was Russell that is controversial even if we played that on TV right now as we did but to the masses that that would still be controversial yeah absolutely so 1967 you know King comes out publicly with his stand against the Vietnam what he says in that in that speech and it's remarkable speech precisely a year before his assassination is the United States is the greatest purveyor of violence on the planet that he says the United States is on the wrong side of a world revolution and the truth is that you know this kind of anti imperialist stance this kind of anti-war stance King in many ways and more broadly many elements of the black freedom struggle I'm headlong embraced this kind of agenda disconnecting racism at home to racism abroad is connecting Jim Crow and white supremacy in the United States to imperialism and to colonialism and to the war agenda but because of Cold War pressures and other pressures because of this emphasis on respectability much of the mainstream civil rights movement had avoided those kind of international critiques and discourses so so kings really embrace of this more radical this more global agenda of justice was really was really remarkable you know and we should also we should also say that listen there's a reason why we have a pacified king there's a reason why right here just a very short clip from the march on Washington speech in 1963 and we don't hear about beyond Vietnam we don't hear about the Poor People's Campaign where King is calling for a massive mobilization of poor people of all colors to converge on DC and demand a basic transformation of the American economy and that is that there are as has been suggested there are very powerful interests that benefit from concealing the realities of the black freedom struggle concealing the fact that this is a working class movement that is calling not just for an end to segregation but it's calling for economic justice and it's calling for a transformation of America's political and economic systems and to this day they're very powerful interests that want to obscure and conceal and suppress that agenda James Heller is actually watching on YouTube we're streaming on YouTube right now let me show you what he just commented on YouTube many people separate king from current day activism and we see rhetoric that was once love that King is being logged at current activists hmm well I think it's very important to understand the kind of sabotage that the civil rights movement and the Black Power movement and the American Indian Movement and movements today have faced from law enforcement and from the yeah so I think it's very important in this kind of superficial climate where we're all celebrating King and everybody's convinced themselves now that they would have been standing right beside dr. King and we have corporations you know taking out full-page ads celebrating the King holiday that we need to remember that the FBI was doing a concerted campaign of sabotage to disrupt and they were planning you know two days before he was assassinated three days before he was assassinated they were planting false stories in newspapers to discredit the Poor People's Campaign to fear monger about the other only poor people as campaign so I think it's very significant that we understand the country in which we live by understanding the ways in which law enforcement has sabotaged social justice I'm just really curious and guess really curious what you made about this this is the FBI conspired against MLK as you was explaining he was tracked his phones were bad they made his life very very difficult and then this tweet here today on the anniversary of his assassination the FBI honors the life work and commitment of dr. Martin Luther King jr. to justice and then there's a quote here and what is this what is is this guilt is this oh we've finally seen the way it's bizarre is this not the epitome of a rebranding of dr. King the FBI are saying we honor you you are a great man now that you've passed away for many years what's going on there the United States lives in a state of perpetual amnesia and the only way they can get away with that is because of our a historicity that we don't you know we are weird divorced from an understanding of our own history that's the only way they could think they could get away with something as outrageous as Oh Reverend dad also oh good yeah we can't hear the rev Rev we need to unmute yourself Jen you go first yeah I was gonna I was gonna and I I do think is a historical and it is this kind of idea that they were trying to also sanitize their own hiss because there are articles right now about the FBI and current agents who have gone through Quantico who are saying how we treat an MLK how are in our organization into MLK is shameful right we're ashamed of how the FBI handled that investigation but shame is not enough right and so when we think about the concerted effort to discredit and undermine MLK's entire existence and the kind of suicide letter that was written to MLK basically cajoling him pushing him to say you know you're an evil person you're a monster you're abnormal these things are not just something to be shameful about there are a larger narrative that tells us how anti blackness works systemically it also provides this kind of buffer against the state right the state is what's actually permitting these forms of anti blackness in these forms of systemic racism against people like MLK which is why the current movement which I do think that we should talk about some um it's so adamant about not following the same rules of the the civil rights era that were that we are accustomed to just get the referendum before we move on to social justice move I think particularly we experienced this in our struggle here in Ferguson that the ways in which King was often set up as the whipping post for younger activists but across the board liberals and conservatives are like misery King so wherever it's brother the former mayor read in Atlanta saying dr. King wouldn't shut down a highway in response to activists shutting down a highway to a former Bill O'Reilly former talk show host on Fox News saying that dr. King would participate in black life now what we do know in terms of what King's life and legacy is is that throughout the 60s all the polling data suggests that they believe the King is hurting his cause with his accidents throughout the 1960s all the polling data is against King and activities of the civil rights movement in fact Kings highest average approval rating yeah he's around forty five percent black night matters polls at 47% yeah so they are neck-and-neck in terms of public perception as relates to their activities in the world and then the question of Martin Luther King and the FBI it's quite shameful King has to go meet with J Edgar Hoover when he comes back from the Nobel Peace Prize because Hoover's called him a notorious liar and said all kinds of dastardly things about him and so King and numbers of his of his staff from SCLC AXA go meet with J Edgar Hoover to get a sense of why he was attacking him with some victory all and so the contradiction that we sealed the FBI tweeting that out in 2007 Durst do think it highlights is hypocrisy but also like the thorough way in which the American public discourse and the American Empire will lie about the that's right all empires I just want to reinforce that right all fires lie all empires engage in this kind of hypocrisy they all engage in this attempt to co-opt and distort the memories of some of their greatest disappoint I brought so mean you make a really good point because 50 years later how do people remember something authentically accurately he has a holiday he has people volunteering for his day he has a statue it's very difficult even even when it's not something who's controversial to remember them accurately I I know it's important that today's social movements are important to you to discuss let me just show you a little clip of dr. King several clips of dr. King looking at the social justice movements he was very close to and when white Americans tell the Negro to lift himself by his own bootstraps they don't oh they don't look over the legacy of slavery and segregation I believe we ought to do we can and seek to lift ourselves by our bootstraps but it's a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself on boots so guess I'm just looking at some tweets about the way that dr. King inspired people's studies right now their activism right now and Gomez Ruben says on Twitter in my Gender Studies class we contextualize his work with the women's movement in the 70s interesting gem because he wasn't well known for his support of women and honest about the room dr. King that is something that we should definitely talk about also says here dr. King's message gave me the confidence to speak out against injustice toward me as a black woman so we're saying that this sanitized version of dr. kieny is out there but he's also influencing new generations younger people Jen but the women question so here's the thing there's a really fantastic article by Michael Denzel Smith and in the Atlantic this week about the ways that MLK was kind of propped up as this kind of quintessential image of idyllic black manhood and you know and there's examples in the article specifically one that stuck out to me was how women in the church would come to to him and ask him questions about their marriage right this kind of Christian based patriarchal heterosexual relationship or they would say how do i navigate this right I'm asking you as a pastor and as a prophet how do i navigate this and how his responses would be very patriarchal and very gendered what are you doing to provoke your husband to be improper toward you or anyway drew is smiling drew why are you smiling it's this agreement I know I was smiling because I think that I think I know the exact column that you know what why do you nag you know are you in agony right I mean I would say the king was doing that column in the late 50s and so but I think the problem was for much of the 1960s the gender attitudes of King and some of the fellow preachers at the SCLC Southern Christian Leadership Conference this organization their gender attitudes were stuck in the 50s for much of the 19th and they did not support the leadership of Ella Baker fully they did septum ah Clarke septum ah Clarke absolutely felt that her voice and her leadership wasn't fully supportive and respected she said septum ah Clark tells stories of she would go to meet SCLC staff meetings and Ralph Abernathy would say why is she here and King would have to say well she's built these field offices she's done all this recognizing and and he would kind of laugh it off and say nice meeting with mom and Abernathy would say the same thing I'm horrified that we have one minute left in this show horrified but I do want Russell to tell me the relevance the you still still resonating in dr. King's work with other movements around the world what dr. King got to keep Ursula was not perfect dr. Kiehl dr. King was not was not complete he was he was a young man when he was when he was shot down and he was evolving rapidly as I think this conversation has suggested I think he was he was being radicalized and he was being radicalized because he was a leader with tremendous integrity and he wanted to align himself with the with the feeling with the aspirations of the master he wrestled working-class we're running at the end of the show so I'm gonna say thank you to Russell to the Reverend - Jenn - drew this conversation continues of course online at AJ stream thank you very much guests for being part of this conversation we really appreciate it take everybody you
