joining me now to discuss the disappearance and possible murder of Jamaal khashoggi a foreign policy analyst author and journalist ruler jibrael who wrote the recent cover story for Newsweek on the Saudi Crown Prince and Sarah Leah Whitson executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch at the moment of course Saudi government officials refused to appear on al-jazeera and other well-known defenders of the Saudi government who we approached to participate in the show declined our invitation ruler Sarah thanks for joining me on upfront before we begin I'd like to play a clip from an episode of upfront that aired earlier this year in which I asked Jamal why he chose a life of self exile in the United States simply because I don't want to be arrested I don't want to be an extra summons army law or some other order the irony that he has no opposition Mohammed bin Salman doesn't have an opposition he doesn't have the Taliban Oscar as I have in Afghanistan most of the people most of the intellectuals most of the people in jail today are supportive of reform that was Jamal Khashoggi on upfront a few months ago and it's quite hard to see that clip and listen to his voice given what we are being told has happened to him ruler the Washington Post where Jamal khashoggi writes a column is reporting this week that US intelligence has worked out that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia MBS Mohammed bin Salman quote ordered an operation to lure Jamal back to the country and then detain him the Turkish government say that he was killed inside the consulate in Istanbul by a Saudi hit team and had his body dismembered Rula what do you believe happened to your friend Jamal I believe that Hamad bin Salman is capable of what he stands accused of of kidnapping however the US intelligence should have warned Jamal it's also there's a lot of blame to put also on US media I believe Jamal risked his life daily to tell the truth to tell all of us what was going on in Saudi Arabia and what this Crown Prince stands for what some media did is basically free did the propaganda of this crown prince he's a reformer and a moderate and a liberal in the words of Tom Friedman and The Economist and others it's outrageous we have an obligation there's a journalistic integrity and then in this case it was betrayed totally and they failed spectacularly its unmitigated disaster what this all of this had caused in the Middle East and for Americans and especially for people who have no interest like Jamaa except telling the truth and informing the public opinion Sarah you document human rights abuses for a living you have to distinguish between facts and fiction between credible reporting and conspiracy theories a lot of people are saying how can we know for sure what happened inside a consulate in Istanbul given the prime source of information as the Turkish government which has its own issues with the Saudi government and which of course doesn't have a great record when it comes to its own journalists who it locks up at record rates well the the main reason that we can know one thing very concretely is that obviously we're not just relying on what the Turkish government has said we are relying on the testimony of his fiance whom I spoke with on the day on which Jamal disappeared into the consulate while she was still at the consulate we have the video showing Jamel entering the consulate and actually what we don't have is any evidence that he ever left so despite the Saudi denials they claim that their CCTV wasn't working or wasn't switched on or something that day which is highly convenient the evidence that he entered and did not leave the consulate of his own accord there's no dispute about that that is an established fact what we don't know of course is what happened to him inside what we have is a lot of suspicious circumstantial evidence and his continued disappearance that sadly indicate that Jamal was killed but Sara if I may add something Mandy the Turks immediately within a day they start talking about a murder inside the consulate how do they know that we know for a fact whoever covered the Middle East that any embassy and any consulate is bugged by nation hosting those consulate so they even went as far the Turks to say that they are willing to go inside the rooms with forensic experts to tell in which room he was butchered and dismembered plus we have this evidence about these two flights coming in with a squad with a team who most of them were identified and the pictures are outside the names are outside and most of them work for security apparatus of the Saudi royal family why were there there in that day why did they enter the embassy in that day why did they live in that day what do they do inside all of these questions need to be answered most US senators came out saying we need to put sanctions and apply for the first time outside of Russia the global Magnitsky Act which is accountability for violators of human right of human rights and I think that's a huge precedent Sarah you were on the show with Jamal and Ali shahe be on this show a few months ago and on that show Jamal made it very clear that he wasn't a member of the Opposition he wasn't even calling for elections or democracy all he wanted to do was be able to write some pieces about the Saudi economy Saudi politics the future under MBS without being censored or restricted that was a very low bar that he was asking MBS to me and yet Mohammed bin Salman MB has the Saudi Crown Prince it looks like he can't even tolerate the mildest of dissent from an establishment Saudi figure Jamal was not some anti-establishment revolutionary was he the Crown Prince wants only one opinion expressed and that's congratulations we love you Crown Prince anything else is suspect and so this has been an unprecedented concentration of power in the hands of one person in Saudi Arabia he has crushed Royals who might have views different from him he's crushed independent journalists or media that might have opinions different from him and of course activists writers journalists scholars just to be even by Saudi standards you're saying this crown prince the de facto ruler is authoritarian and controlling and dictatorial that's what you're saying well it's it's I would even say I would even say revolutionary because I think he has called two of the bluffs that Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabian analysts have long used to understand and explain Saudi Arabia one is that it rules by consensus that all of the Royals have a voice in how the country is run and that's actually why things operate very slowly in Saudi Arabia because it's built on consensus he eradicated that by jailing Royals who might have any opposition to his plans and second that the Saudi government relies on the support of the religious establishment he's also knocked that pillar out let me ask you this rule Jamal in his Washington Post columns which are said to have annoyed the crown prince and his advisers so much this platform he had in the US in English and in Arabic he compared MBS to Ayatollah Khamenei the Supreme Leader of Iran and to Vladimir Putin the President of Russia you and some others in recent days have compared MBS to Gadhafi do you think that is now a label that is going to stick in Western circles where MBS has been so popular up until now look Jamal wrote also that the Saudis deserved better I think we the people in America or people around the world we deserve better in terms of journalistic standards of the way we cover these tyrants but above all we deserve better from these governments and President Trump who says well you know we have a problem they buy a lot of hardware webinar is so how can we it would be bad for business well it's bad for America standing Americans values it's bad for all of us what he's saying his present Trump is endorsing the idea the UN program and rebranding it oil-for-food in this case cheap oil for impunity for to assassinate whoever you want to assassinate whenever you want no I think we made our language is it change I don't know if Trump will change but he will be forced to change by the public opinion and that's why it's important to keep the pressure on the public opinion this is not even Gaddafi this is combine of Gaddafi and and I would say Saddam Hussein together this is Gaddafi on steroids however it's worse than Gaddafi because he has billions of dollars to spend in the US on PR and lobbying and buying consensus and this is where the dangerous lies Sarah you at Human Rights Watch have obviously spent a lot of time calling on governments to do something about human rights abuses in places like Saudi Arabia and Western governments tend to ignore you because of the oil deals and the commercial deals that Rula mentioned right now though you do have Mike Pence demanding answers you have Marco Rubio Rand Paul Republican right wing senators coming out and saying you know this is not acceptable if this is true there need to be consequences do you think you're we're gonna see some kind of sea change in the u.s. relationship with Saudi Arabia over what has happened to Jamal khashoggi you know two days ago I would have said no however the recent bipartisan letter demanding answers demanding an investigation and threatening sanctions with the citation of the man jet ski act is a bit of a surprise and a pleasant one I would say because clearly this time Saudi has really triggered the red lines of unacceptable conduct even in our broken dysfunctional government here in the United States and so it's remarkable that MBS has actually managed to bring together our dysfunctional Senate and senators to act in a unified voice to demand accountability and promise sanctions which is what they should be doing so it's actually heartening but ruler let me put this to you as much as we're glad that Western governments the US government is taking interest in this case and in the fate of Jamal Khashoggi and asking for an investigation asking for questions to be answered isn't it a little bit depressing that it required the disappearance and possible murder of poor Jamal khashoggi for US senators and a vice president and US media to and Tom Friedman to suddenly say oh there's a problem in Saudi Arabia what about the war in Yemen that's still going on regardless of what's happened to Jamal Khashoggi what about all the other people that Sarah mentioned who have been detained and tortured and disappeared in Saudi Arabia yes it it's depressing disheartening however I would never forget the words of Kofi Annan who used to say that the one of the most important tools to fight human right violations and violators is to shed lights on what they're doing their action their deeds not what they're saying for the first time we're seeing this is implemented however after many lines were crossed after Mohammed bin Salman kidnapped the Prime Minister Hariri and and forced him to resign after he bombed an entire country and an uncaused a humanitarian catastrophe after even he bombed I believe two months ago a school bus in Yemen killing 40 children however I think in this case it touches us very close because Jamal was working for a u.s. organization was a US residence and knew many of the people who wrote that Hamad bin Salman was a reformer Sarah last question to you you knew Jamal well you spoke to his fiance shortly afterwards when he walked into that consular do you think he knew how big the risk was that he was taking I don't know I think he had been given assurances before the prior week when he had gone to the consulate to request this document and they told him to come back I think he believed that his contacts in Turkey with both Saudi government representatives and the Turkish government did an additional measure of security and sometimes we believe what we want to believe and what Jamal wanted was a certificate attesting to his divorce so that he could marry his fiancee and start a new life and you know love sometimes makes us to take risks that we wouldn't otherwise take and and that's that's the best way I can think of this that Jamal's heart was speaking when he walked into that consulate we'll have to leave it there the Saudi say they did not kill him never have I wanted to believe the Saudi government more sarolea whips and religion real thanks for joining me on upfront Thank You Marty
