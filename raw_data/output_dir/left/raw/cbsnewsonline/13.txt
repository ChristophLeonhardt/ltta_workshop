1
00:00:01,534 --> 00:00:01,767
START. 

2
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:02,033
WE START. 

3
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:02,802
IT'S A GREAT CROWD. 

4
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:07,874
OH, MONTANA TO ME IS A VERY BIG 

5
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:09,442
AND POWERFUL STATE I CAN TELL 

6
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,478
YOU THAT. 

7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:15,949
AT LEAST IT WILL BE AFTER MATT 

8
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:17,816
ROSENDALE BECOMES YOUR SENATOR. 

9
00:00:17,816 --> 00:00:18,183
HE'S GREAT. 

10
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:23,656
BUT I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE IN 

11
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,292
MONTANA WITH THOUSANDS OF 

12
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,263
LOYAL, HARD WORKING, INCREDIBLE 

13
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:30,696
AMERICAN PATRIOTS. 

14
00:00:30,696 --> 00:00:33,633
HARD TO BELIEVE I'M SAYING THIS 

15
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:35,502
BECAUSE IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE 

16
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:35,702
TIME. 

17
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,969
LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO, BUT 

18
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:38,905
ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO, RIGHT? 

19
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:41,574
THAT WAS SOME DAY. 

20
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,875
THAT WAS SOME EVENING. 

21
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,777
THAT WAS SOME PERIOD. 

22
00:00:44,777 --> 00:00:48,148
THAT WAS A MOVEMENT LIKE WE'VE 

23
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:48,948
NEVER EVER SEEN BEFORE. 

24
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,817
AND HERE WE ARE AGAIN. 

25
00:00:51,817 --> 00:00:53,786
IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE, DOESN'T 

26
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:55,588
SEEM LONG, BUT IT FLIES. 

27
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,255
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE HAVING A 

28
00:00:56,255 --> 00:01:00,260
GOOD TIME, AND YOU'RE DOING A 

29
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,695
GOOD JOB, TIME FLIES, RIGHT? 

30
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:02,995
TIME FLIES. 

31
00:01:02,995 --> 00:01:05,632
AND IN JUST 19 DAYS, THE PEOPLE 

32
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,234
OF THIS INCREDIBLE STATE ARE 

33
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:13,239
GOING TO SEND MATT ROSENDALE TO 

34
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,342
THE U.S. SENATE TO PROTECT YOUR 

35
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:19,913
JOBS, AND PROTECT YOUR SECOND 

36
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,514
AMENDMENT, WHICH IS UNDER 

37
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:22,015
SIEGE. 

38
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:29,121
THIS I WOULD THINK IS A VERY 

39
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:29,889
BIG SECOND AMENDMENT PLACE. 

40
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,358
I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THE ONE 

41
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,360
THAT WALKS INTO YOUR HOUSES. 

42
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,930
GIVE ME THAT GUN. 

43
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,133
NOBODY HAS THE COURAGE TO DO 

44
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:40,366
THAT. 

45
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,634
MATT IS GOING TO PROTECT YOUR 

46
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,169
SECOND AMENDMENT, AND HE'S 

47
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,671
GOING TO DEFEND YOUR BORDERS, 

48
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,606
AND WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB ON 

49
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,441
THOSE BORDERS WITH THE WORST 

50
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,478
LAWS YOU'VE EVER SEEN, AND WE 

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:54,714
ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN 

52
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:54,980
TOGETHER. 

53
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,951
REALLY ARE. 

54
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,186
THIS IS TRULY AN INCREDIBLE 

55
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:02,187
TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

56
00:02:02,187 --> 00:02:03,556
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL 

57
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:09,294
TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN OVER 50 

58
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,363
YEARS. 

59
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,497
THINK OF THAT. 

60
00:02:11,497 --> 00:02:17,937
MORE AMERICANS ARE NOW WORKING 

61
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:18,571
THAN EVER BEFORE. 

62
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,672
HERE IN MONTANA, HOUSEHOLD 

63
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:24,244
INCOMES HAVE REACHED AN ALL-

64
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:24,944
TIME HIGH. 

65
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,612
THINK OF THAT. 

66
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:31,651
THINK OF THAT. 

67
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,318
AND WE WATCH MONTANA. 

68
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:35,487
WE WATCH YOU MINERS, YOU 

69
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:37,156
LOGGERS, YOU RANCHERS, WE WATCH 

70
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:37,557
MONTANA. 

71
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,192
AND YOU KNOW TWO YEARS AGO YOU 

72
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:44,264
WATCHED OVER ME, BECAUSE WE WON 

73
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:48,401
THIS STATE BY A LOT. 

74
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:48,668
RIGHT? 

75
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,170
THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE QUICKIES, 

76
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,136
I LOVE THOSE STATES. 

77
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:52,638
YOU KNOW THE POLLS CLOSED. 

78
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:55,775
THE POLES HAVE JUST CLOSED IN 

79
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:56,642
THE STATE OF MONTANA. 

80
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,444
TRUMP HAS WON MONTANA. 

81
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,647
IT'S LIKE -- THEY SAY IT, 

82
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,482
BECAUSE WHEN IT'S THAT BIG, 

83
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:06,252
THEY ANNOUNCE IT WITHIN 

84
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,553
SECONDS. 

85
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,655
IT'S JUST A FLOW. 

86
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:11,057
THEY DO COMMA, TRUMP HAS WON 

87
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:11,324
MONTANA. 

88
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,092
YOU'VE BEEN GREAT TO ME. 

89
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,628
WE'RE ALSO TAKING CARE OF YOUR 

90
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:16,362
VETERANS. 

91
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:22,101
YOU HAVE A LOT OF VETERANS IN 

92
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:22,935
MONTANA. 

93
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,871
AND OUR MILITARY, YOU KNOW 

94
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,406
WE'VE REBUILT, AND ARE 

95
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:30,610
REBUILDING OUR MILITARY, WILL 

96
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,211
SOON BE MORE POWERFUL THAN EVER 

97
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:32,444
BEFORE. 

98
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:35,615
AND HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO 

99
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:35,848
USE IT. 

100
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:36,883
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT 

101
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,483
HAVING IT. 

102
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:38,885
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY SAY, OKAY, 

103
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,020
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THAT. 

104
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,289
THAT'S THE WAY LIFE WORKS ISN'T 

105
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:43,690
IT? 

106
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,091
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE MOST 

107
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:46,426
POWERFUL MILITARY BY FAR THAT 

108
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:49,128
WE'VE EVER HAD, AND A LOT OF IT 

109
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,197
IS ALREADY COMING. 

110
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:55,735
THOSE BRAND NEW BEAUTIFUL 

111
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:56,369
PLANES. 

112
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,771
THOSE INCREDIBLE STEALTH F35s. 

113
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:02,007
YEAH, THE F35, YOU HAVE THE F-

114
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:03,876
18s, THE SUPER DUPERS. 

115
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:04,209
THE HORNETS. 

116
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:05,411
WE HAVE THEM ALL. 

117
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,312
WE'VE GOT THEM COMING LEFT AND 

118
00:04:07,312 --> 00:04:08,214
RIGHT. 

119
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,149
AND YOU KNOW THE GREAT THING? 

120
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,451
THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT 

121
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:12,285
THAN THE MILITARY, BUT WE BUILD 

122
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:16,255
THEM ALL RIGHT HERE IN THE 

123
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:16,488
U.S.A. 

124
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,391
WE DON'T SEND THEM TO OTHER 

125
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,524
COUNTRIES TO BE BUILT. 

126
00:04:19,524 --> 00:04:22,995
WE BUILD THEM RIGHT HERE. 

127
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,230
WE HAVE THE BEST MILITARY 

128
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,231
EQUIPMENT IN THE WORLD. 

129
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,632
WE BUILD THE BEST. 

130
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,801
THERE'S NOTHING EVEN CLOSE. 

131
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,236
BEST MISSILES, BEST PLANES, 

132
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:32,305
BEST SHIPS, BEST EVERYTHING. 

133
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,840
WE BUILD THEM HERE. 

134
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,911
SUBMARINES, WE'RE SO FAR AHEAD 

135
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:39,278
OF EVERYTHING. 

136
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:39,578
FORGET IT. 

137
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,214
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, 

138
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,715
AMERICA IS BOOMING. 

139
00:04:43,715 --> 00:04:44,484
AMERICA IS THRIVING, AND 

140
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,919
AMERICA IS WINNING, BECAUSE WE 

141
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,221
ARE FINALLY PUTTING AMERICA 

142
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:52,992
FIRST AGAIN. 

143
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,326
IT'S AMERICA FIRST. 

144
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,161
YOU KNOW THAT. 

145
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,395
WE'RE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST. 

146
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,498
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THAT FOR A 

147
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,165
LONG TIME. 

148
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:03,236
FOR MANY, MANY DECADES YOU 

149
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:03,603
HAVEN'T HEARD. 

150
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,437
JUST LAST WEEK WE SHAVED 

151
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,938
ANOTHER HISTORIC VICTORY FOR 

152
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:07,440
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN A 

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,709
BEAUTIFUL CEREMONY AT THE WHITE 

154
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:10,410
HOUSE. 

155
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,480
WE PROUDLY SWORE IN THE NEWEST 

156
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,420
MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES 

157
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,922
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT 

158
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,856
KAVANAUGH. 

159
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,192
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 

160
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:32,098
AND THOSE DEMOCRATS TREATED HIM 

161
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:32,331
BADLY. 

162
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:32,665
VERY UNFAIR. 

163
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,701
THAT WAS AN UNFAIR DEAL. 

164
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:40,940
FROM THE SECOND THE SUPREME 

165
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,942
COURT VACANCY OPENED, DEMOCRATS 

166
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,378
RUN A HEARTLESS CAMPAIGN OF 

167
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,180
POLITICAL AND PERSONAL 

168
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,080
DESTRUCTION. 

169
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,547
IT WAS DISGRACEFUL. 

170
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:50,716
BEFORE HE WAS EVEN CHOSEN. 

171
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:54,420
BEFORE I EVEN KNEW WHO I WAS 

172
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,189
GOING TO PICK, THEY WERE SAYING 

173
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,957
HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT MY 

174
00:05:57,957 --> 00:05:58,257
CANDIDATE. 

175
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,661
I SAID I HAVEN'T PICKED ANYONE 

176
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:01,861
YET. 

177
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:02,528
GREAT PEOPLE. 

178
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,430
THAT WAS TERRIBLE WHAT THEY DID 

179
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:04,997
WAS TERRIBLE. 

180
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,566
WHAT THEY DID TO BRETT 

181
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,401
KAVANAUGH AND HIS BEAUTIFUL 

182
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:10,636
FAMILY IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE 

183
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:15,641
THAT WILL NOT BE SOON 

184
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:15,941
FORGOTTEN. 

185
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:16,308
REMEMBER THAT. 

186
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:17,910
AND COME ELECTION DAY AMERICANS 

187
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,345
WILL REMEMBER KAVANAUGH, AND 

188
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,381
THEY WILL REMEMBER ALL SORTS OF 

189
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,817
OTHER THINGS BECAUSE THAT WAS A 

190
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,853
SHAMEFUL ACT, AND THERE ARE 

191
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,988
MANY OTHER SHAMEFUL ACTS, 

192
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,122
INCLUDING WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO 

193
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,557
OUR BORDER BY SAYING WE'RE NOT 

194
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,493
GOING TO GIVE YOU THE LAWS THAT 

195
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,727
YOU NEED TO PROTECT OUR 

196
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,928
COUNTRY, BUT WE'RE TAKING IT, 

197
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:42,635
AND WE'RE DOING IT, AND WE HAVE 

198
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:44,837
GREAT THINGS HAPPENING. 

199
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:48,608
THIS WILL BE AN ELECTION OF 

200
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:48,908
KAVANAUGH. 

201
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,242
THE CARAVAN. 

202
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,175
LAW AND ORDER, AND COMMON 

203
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:50,409
SENSE. 

204
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,110
THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE. 

205
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,383
IT'S GOING TO BE AN ELECTION OF 

206
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,450
THOSE THINGS. 

207
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,052
LAW AND ORDER. 

208
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:00,352
KAVANAUGH. 

209
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:00,953
REMEMBER COMMON SENSE, AND 

210
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:05,057
REMEMBER IT'S GOING TO BE AN 

211
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:06,325
ELECTION OF THE CARAVAN. 

212
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,559
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 

213
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:07,793
ABOUT. 

214
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,295
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING 

215
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:09,528
ABOUT. 

216
00:07:09,528 --> 00:07:10,830
AND NOW WE'RE STARTING TO FIND 

217
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,598
OUT, AND I WON'T SAY IT 100%, 

218
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,899
I'LL PUT A LITTLE TINY QUESTION 

219
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:16,368
MARK AT THE END, BUT WE'RE 

220
00:07:16,368 --> 00:07:17,770
PROBABLY NOT GOING TO NEED IT, 

221
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,442
BUT WE HAVE THE FAKE NEWS BACK 

222
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:28,281
THERE.  

223
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:33,119
FAKE NEWS. 

224
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,587
BUT A LOT OF MONEY HAS BEEN 

225
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,923
PASSING THROUGH PEOPLE TO COME 

226
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:39,392
UP AND TRY AND GET TO THE 

227
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,426
BORDER BY ELECTION DAY. 

228
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,161
BECAUSE THEY THINK THAT'S A 

229
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,729
NEGATIVE FOR US. 

230
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,832
NUMBER 1, THEY'RE BEING 

231
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:47,099
STOPPED. 

232
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:47,632
AND NUMBER 2, REGARDLESS, 

233
00:07:47,632 --> 00:07:48,967
THAT'S OUR ISSUE. 

234
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:51,437
SO THIS IS THE PROBLEM WITH 

235
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:51,637
THEM. 

236
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,907
THEY HAVE ONE THING THEY STICK 

237
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:55,908
TOGETHER. 

238
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,109
THEY VOTE TOGETHER. 

239
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,777
THEY'RE BAD POLITICIANS, THEY 

240
00:07:58,777 --> 00:07:59,678
HAVE HORRIBLE POLICY. 

241
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:00,612
THEY HATE I.C.E. 

242
00:08:00,612 --> 00:08:01,780
THEY DON'T LIKE OUR MILITARY. 

243
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,215
THEY DON'T LIKE OUR VETS. 

244
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:04,650
THEY'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING US ON 

245
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,251
THAT. 

246
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:06,318
THEY HAVE LOUSY POLICY. 

247
00:08:06,318 --> 00:08:09,488
THE ONE THING, THEY STICK 

248
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:10,590
TOGETHER, BUT THEY WANTED THAT 

249
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,592
CARAVAN, AND THERE ARE THOSE 

250
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,725
THAT SAY THAT CARAVAN DIDN'T 

251
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:14,627
JUST HAPPEN. 

252
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:17,263
IT DIDN'T JUST HAPPEN. 

253
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,065
A LOT OF REASONS THAT CARAVAN, 

254
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,334
4,000 PEOPLE, BUT I JUST WANT 

255
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,069
TO THANK THE MEXICAN 

256
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:23,870
GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE THEY'RE 

257
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,241
STOPPING IT HOPEFULLY BEFORE IT 

258
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,343
EVER GETS TO MEXICO. 

259
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,878
AS YOU KNOW, I AM WILLING TO 

260
00:08:32,878 --> 00:08:37,650
SEND THE MILITARY TO DEFEND OUR 

261
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:43,522
SOUTHERN BORDER IF NECESSARY. 

262
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:45,391
ALL BECAUSE OF THE ILLEGAL 

263
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:46,926
IMMIGRATION ONSLAUGHT BROUGHT 

264
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,661
BY THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY 

265
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,029
REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE, OR TO 

266
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,330
CHANGE THE LAWS. 

267
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,298
THEY LIKE IT. 

268
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,832
THEY ALSO FIGURE EVERYBODY 

269
00:08:53,832 --> 00:09:00,272
COMING IN'S GOING TO VOTE 

270
00:09:00,272 --> 00:09:00,539
DEMOCRAT. 

271
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:00,805
YOU KNOW. 

272
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:02,508
HEY, THEY'RE NOT SO STUPID WHEN 

273
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:03,776
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, RIGHT? 

274
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,912
BUT THEY ARE CRAZY. 

275
00:09:06,912 --> 00:09:09,248
THE CRAZY DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO 

276
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:13,085
SUPPORT ANY FORM OF BORDER 

277
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:17,189
SECURITY LEGISLATION TO FIX OUR 

278
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:17,856
ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE, OLD 

279
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,191
FASHIONED LOOPHOLE RIDDEN 

280
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:19,591
IMMIGRATION LAWS. 

281
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:20,826
WE HAVE THE WORST LAWS ANYWHERE 

282
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,261
IN THE WORLD. 

283
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,896
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST LAWS 

284
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,164
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. 

285
00:09:26,164 --> 00:09:32,338
SOMEBODY COMES IN, AND WE SAY, 

286
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:32,871
EXCUSE ME. 

287
00:09:32,871 --> 00:09:34,540
A FOOT HITS THE GROUND. 

288
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,208
A FOOT HITS THE GROUND, WE'RE 

289
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,310
NOT ALLOWED TO SAY GO BACK. 

290
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,546
A FOOT HITS THE GROUND, WE HAVE 

291
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,982
TO BY LAW, WITH THESE HORRIBLE 

292
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,883
PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING THEIR 

293
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,419
OWN RULINGS, HAVING NOTHING TO 

294
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,087
DO WITH OUR CONSTITUTION, WE 

295
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,423
HAVE TO TAKE THOSE PEOPLE IN, 

296
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,191
EVEN IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS. 

297
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:56,128
AND WE HAVE HARDENED CRIMINALS 

298
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:56,428
COMING IN. 

299
00:09:56,428 --> 00:10:00,433
YOU THINK THOSE PEOPLE ARE 

300
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:00,766
PERFECT? 

301
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,366
THEY'RE NOT PERFECT. 

302
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:02,902
YOU HAVE SOME HARDENED, BAD 

303
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,403
PEOPLE COMING IN. 

304
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:08,474
AND BY LAW, WE HAVE TO TAKE 

305
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,843
THEM IN, AND THEN IT'S CALLED 

306
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:11,410
CATCH AND RELEASE. 

307
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,145
YOU EVER HEAR OF THIS ONE? 

308
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:13,746
YOU CATCH THEM. 

309
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,681
YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THEM. 

310
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,783
EVEN IF YOU FIND OUT BAD 

311
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,552
THINGS, YOU CATCH THEM AND YOU 

312
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:19,885
RELEASE THEM. 

313
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:23,356
AND THEN YOU SAY, COME BACK FOR 

314
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:23,756
A COURT CASE. 

315
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:24,757
THERE'S ONLY A PROBLEM, THERE'S 

316
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,891
NOT ENOUGH JUDGES IN THE WORLD 

317
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,027
TO TAKE CARE OF IT. 

318
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:31,564
AND I WILL SAY, I HAVE CAUSED 

319
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:31,897
THE PROBLEM. 

320
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,900
I'M TAKING FULL BLAME. 

321
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,734
YOU KNOW WHY? 

322
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:37,569
EVERYONE'S LIKE IN SHOCK. 

323
00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:39,705
IT'S MY, HEY LOOK, FAKE NEWS, 

324
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:43,542
IT'S MY PROBLEM, I CAUSED IT. 

325
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,112
BECAUSE I HAVE CREATED SUCH AN 

326
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:46,545
INCREDIBLE ECONOMY. 

327
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,581
I HAVE CREATED SO MANY JOBS. 

328
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:51,283
I'VE MADE THIS COUNTRY WITH YOU 

329
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,753
SO GREAT THAT EVERYBODY WANTS 

330
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:56,288
TO COME IN. 

331
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,792
SO THEY'RE ALL POURING IN, OR 

332
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:00,158
TRYING TO. 

333
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,827
SO, WITH THE WORST LAWS IN THE 

334
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:07,366
WORLD WE'RE DOING A OF A JOB. 

335
00:11:07,366 --> 00:11:09,468
BUT WE'VE MADE OUR COUNTRY 

336
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:09,701
STRONG. 

337
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,003
WE'VE MADE OUR COUNTRY 

338
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,772
RESPECTED, AND PEOPLE WANT TO 

339
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:13,039
COME IN. 

340
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,807
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT WE HAVE 

341
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,775
TO DO, WE NEED VOTES. 

342
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:18,444
MEANING WE NEED REPUBLICANS TO 

343
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:19,311
VOTE. 

344
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,246
YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP HEARING, WE 

345
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,079
HAVE A MAJORITY. 

346
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,848
WE HAVE A MAJORITY THAT IF 

347
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,583
SOMEBODY HAS A COLD, IF 

348
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,819
SOMEBODY'S NOT FEELING WELL, WE 

349
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:27,319
LOSE OUR MAJORITY. 

350
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,187
THAT'S HOW IT IS. 

351
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,423
WE HAVE LIKE ALMOST LIKE 

352
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:32,024
IDENTICAL. 

353
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,261
WE HAVE TO HAVE MORE VOTES, SO 

354
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:35,927
WE CAN PUT IN STRONG 

355
00:11:35,927 --> 00:11:40,032
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, BUT 

356
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,499
COMMON SENSE. 

357
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:41,033
IT'S NOT EVEN REPUBLICAN 

358
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,670
CONSERVATIVE, IT'S COMMON SENSE 

359
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,037
POLICIES. 

360
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:45,470
IT'S COMMON SENSE. 

361
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,907
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A LOT OF 

362
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,041
DEMOCRATS THAT SUPPORT US, 

363
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:49,308
FRANKLY. 

364
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:56,215
WE HAVE A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATS 

365
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:56,848
THAT AREN'T CRAZY. 

366
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:57,182
INTELLIGENT. 

367
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:58,951
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS 

368
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,054
GONE SO FAR LEFT THAT NOBODY 

369
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,222
KNOWS WHAT TO DO. 

370
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,525
IT'S BECOME RADICAL RESISTENCE. 

371
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,859
YOU EVER SEE THEIR SIGNS? 

372
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:08,160
RESIST. 

373
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,829
THEY SAY WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO 

374
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:10,162
RESIST? 

375
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:10,663
I DON'T KNOW. 

376
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:13,232
DID YOU EVER SEE WHEN THE FAKE 

377
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:13,699
NEWS INTERVIEW THEM? 

378
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:15,367
THEY'LL GO TO A PERSON HOLDING 

379
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:23,142
A SIGN WHO GETS PAID BY SAROS 

380
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:23,608
OR SOMEBODY. 

381
00:12:23,608 --> 00:12:25,978
DID YOU SEE THAT WITH JUSTICE 

382
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:27,079
KAVANAUGH, AND BY THE WAY, ALSO 

383
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,646
WITH JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH. 

384
00:12:28,646 --> 00:12:30,715
HOW GOOD IS HE? 

385
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,084
IT'S A GREAT TWO PEOPLE. 

386
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,119
BUT DID YOU SEE THE SIGNS? 

387
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:35,821
THEY'RE BRAND NEW. 

388
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,490
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL, THE BLACK 

389
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:38,890
AND WHITE SIGNS. 

390
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,459
EVERYBODY HAS THE SAME SIGNS, 

391
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,061
RIGHT FROM THE FINEST PRINTER 

392
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:42,428
IN WASHINGTON. 

393
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,164
THOSE ARE NOT SIGNS MADE IN THE 

394
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:45,431
BASEMENT. 

395
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:45,931
THEY'RE ALL IDENTICAL. 

396
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,433
I POINTED THAT OUT, AND THE 

397
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,001
NEXT DAY EVERY HAD SIGNS THAT 

398
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,403
LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE MADE IN 

399
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:51,736
THE BASEMENT. 

400
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,505
I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THE BLACK 

401
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:54,506
AND WHITE ONES. 

402
00:12:54,506 --> 00:12:55,841
HEY, THERE'S A LOT OF RIGGED 

403
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:56,775
THINGS GOING ON IN THIS 

404
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,711
COUNTRY, YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT. 

405
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:03,249
A LOT OF RIGGED THINGS GOING 

406
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:03,415
ON. 

407
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,682
JUST ASK BERNIE SANDERS. 

408
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:07,085
DO YOU THINK THINGS ARE RIGGED 

409
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:07,319
BERNIE? 

410
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:08,286
YOU CAN ASK ME TOO. 

411
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:11,023
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT RIGGING. 

412
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,024
I TELL YOU WHAT. 

413
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:16,428
BUT WE FIGHT LIKE NOBODY EVER 

414
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,229
FOUGHT BEFORE. 

415
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,532
YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO. 

416
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,366
WE FIGHT, AND WE WIN, AND WE 

417
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:25,037
FIGHT HARDER THAN ANYBODY EVER 

418
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:25,270
FOUGHT. 

419
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,406
AND THEN THEY SAY, OH, IT'S 

420
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:27,739
OBSTRUCTION. 

421
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:28,173
IT'S OBSTRUCTION. 

422
00:13:28,173 --> 00:13:30,910
IF YOU FIGHT BACK TODAY IT'S 

423
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,343
CALLED OBSTRUCTION. 

424
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,511
NO, NO, NO. 

425
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:33,145
WE FIGHT BACK. 

426
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:37,983
CALL IT WHATEVER THE YOU WANT. 

427
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,719
WE FIGHT BACK. 

428
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:41,120
OBSTRUCTION. 

429
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,256
YOU KNOW, I JUST WALKED IN ON A 

430
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,690
BIG STRONG GUY GRABBED ME. 

431
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,392
AND HE WAS ALMOST CRYING. 

432
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:52,031
AND IT HAPPENS EVERY TIME. 

433
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:52,398
AND MANY TIMES. 

434
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,767
AND HE SAID, SIR, MR. 

435
00:13:54,767 --> 00:14:00,239
PRESIDENT, THANK YOU SO MUCH 

436
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,674
FOR SAVING OUR COUNTRY. 

437
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:03,876
AND YOU KNOW, NOW I'VE, I HEAR 

438
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,178
IT ALL THE TIME. 

439
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,314
THOSE EXACT WORDS, THANK YOU 

440
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,415
FOR SAVING OUR COUNTRY, AND AT 

441
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,983
FIRST I HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT 

442
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,052
MONTHS AGO. 

443
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,887
YOU SEE WHAT WE DID WITH TAXES. 

444
00:14:15,887 --> 00:14:17,656
FORGET TAXES, WITH SO MANY 

445
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,326
THINGS MORE IMPORTANT THAN TAX 

446
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:20,526
CUTS. 

447
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,994
ALTHOUGH THOSE TAX CUTS THEY 

448
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:25,364
CAME IN HANDY, DIDN'T THEY? 

449
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,665
EVERYBODY BENEFITED FROM THAT. 

450
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,366
BUT REGULATION. 

451
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,101
YOU ADD IT ALL UP, AND THEY SAY 

452
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:30,402
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. 

453
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,804
PRESIDENT FOR SAVING OUR 

454
00:14:31,804 --> 00:14:32,071
COUNTRY. 

455
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:32,938
THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE ALL 

456
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,474
TOGETHER, BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN 

457
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,876
A MOVEMENT LIKE WE'VE NEVER 

458
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,811
SEEN BEFORE IN OUR COUNTRY, 

459
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:39,645
LIKE PROBABLY ALMOST EVERY 

460
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,580
COUNTRY, THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A 

461
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,781
MOVEMENT LIKE WHAT HAPPENED 

462
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,317
WITH US IN 2016. 

463
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:51,323
AND WE ALL TOGETHER, NOT ME, 

464
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,057
I'M A SPOKESPERSON. 

465
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:56,662
BY THE WAY, HOW HAVE I DONE? 

466
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,964
HAVE I DONE OKAY? 

467
00:14:58,964 --> 00:14:59,264
[CHEERING] 

468
00:14:59,264 --> 00:15:00,799
I WAS SPEAKING TO A BIG 

469
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,970
POLITICIAN THE OTHER DAY, IT 

470
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,238
WAS SORT OF FUNNY, HE WAS 

471
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,506
TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. 

472
00:15:07,506 --> 00:15:11,076
YOU WANT ME TO DO SOMETHING IN 

473
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:11,944
A CERTAIN WAY. 

474
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,379
SAID SIR, I'VE WON FIVE 

475
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,279
ELECTIONS. 

476
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:14,913
I'VE RUN EIGHT TIMES. 

477
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:17,416
SO I'VE WON, SIR, FIVE. 

478
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,084
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. 

479
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,051
I'M A PROFESSIONAL. 

480
00:15:20,051 --> 00:15:21,620
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG 

481
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,254
TIME. 

482
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:22,887
SO THINK OF IT. 

483
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:24,356
HE RUNS EIGHT TIMES. 

484
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,258
SIR, I WON FIVE ELECTIONS. 

485
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,061
I SAID WELL YOU GOT ME THAT. 

486
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:31,830
I RAN ONCE, AND I WON ONE 

487
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,133
ELECTION, BUT IT'S THE 

488
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:34,566
PRESIDENCY, RIGHT? 

489
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,505
THAT'S RIGHT.  

490
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:45,377
THE PRESIDENCY. 

491
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:46,411
IT'S THE PRESIDENCY. 

492
00:15:46,411 --> 00:15:46,744
THINK OF IT. 

493
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:49,114
WE'RE ONE FOR ONE. 

494
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:56,355
WE'RE GOING TO SOON BE TWO FOR 

495
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,023
TWO, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE IT. 

496
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:00,159
ALTHOUGH A LOT OF FAKE NEWS 

497
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,628
SAID HE'S NOT GOING TO STOP AT 

498
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:02,961
EIGHT YEARS. 

499
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:04,329
HE'S GOING LONGER. 

500
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:05,831
WE'LL NEVER TAKE IT AWAY FROM 

501
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,031
HIM. 

502
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:07,533
THIS IS LIKE THE GROUP OF THEM. 

503
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:11,070
FIRST THEY SAY, HE DOESN'T KNOW 

504
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,470
WHAT HE'S DOING. 

505
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,371
PERHAPS HE'S INCOMPETENT, HE 

506
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:14,940
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING. 

507
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,941
THEN TWO MINUTES LATER SAY, 

508
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,776
HE'S GUNNING FOR EIGHT YEARS, 

509
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,278
HE'S GOING TO TAKE IT FOR 

510
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:19,812
LONGER. 

511
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,412
YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH. 

512
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,314
YOU CAN ONLY GO ONE WAY OR THE 

513
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:22,681
OTHER. 

514
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,883
NO, EIGHT YEARS IS GOING TO BE 

515
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:25,084
FINE. 

516
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,219
EIGHT YEARS, GOING TO BE FINE. 

517
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,254
IT'S ALL THE TIME WE NEED. 

518
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:33,225
THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE NEED TO 

519
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,492
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

520
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:36,428
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. 

521
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:40,865
IS THAT MAYBE THE GREATEST 

522
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:44,236
SLOGAN IN THE HISTORY OF RUNS? 

523
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:44,502
RIGHT? 

524
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:45,303
YOU REMEMBER HILLARY'S SLOGAN? 

525
00:16:45,303 --> 00:16:46,771
IT WAS THE WORST SLOGAN. 

526
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:47,973
THEY PAID LIKE A MILLION 

527
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,310
DOLLARS FOR SOME GUY TO MAKE 

528
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,579
THE SLOGAN, AND AFTER I 

529
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,579
DISSECTED IT AT ONE SPEECH, 

530
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:57,683
THEY CHANGED IT THE NEXT DAY. 

531
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,918
COME TOGETHER OR SOMETHING 

532
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:00,185
TERRIBLE. 

533
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:00,552
COME TOGETHER. 

534
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,288
SHE'S A GREAT UNIFIER, RIGHT. 

535
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,223
A GREAT UNIFIER. 

536
00:17:05,223 --> 00:17:06,425
CROOKED HILLARY IS A GREAT 

537
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:19,738
UNIFIER. 

538
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:21,373
IT IS INCREDIBLE THE DEEP 

539
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,108
STATE, WHERE THEY DON'T EVEN 

540
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,010
LOOK AT HER. 

541
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,545
ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE? 

542
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,981
THINK OF IT. 

543
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:29,614
33,000 EMAILS. 

544
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,250
SHE GETS A SUBPOENA FROM THE 

545
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,384
UNITED STATES CONGRESS. 

546
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,752
FORGET ABOUT ALL THE OTHER 

547
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,286
THINGS. 

548
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:36,355
FORGET ABOUT, AND YOU CAN NEVER 

549
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:39,191
FORGET ABOUT BENGHAZI, EVER. 

550
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,526
BUT FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING 

551
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:40,926
ELSE. 

552
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:41,926
NEVER FORGET BENGHAZI. 

553
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:47,466
BUT FORGET ABOUT ALL THE OTHER 

554
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:47,699
THINGS. 

555
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,066
33,000 EMAILS. 

556
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:52,171
SHE GETS A SUBPOENA . NOT LIKE 

557
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,604
A SUBPOENA FROM YOU, OR YOU, OR 

558
00:17:53,604 --> 00:17:55,407
THAT YOUNG PERSON BACK THERE. 

559
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,176
A SUBPOENA FROM THE UNITED 

560
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,443
STATES CONGRESS. 

561
00:17:58,443 --> 00:17:59,577
SHE GETS IT. 

562
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:04,216
THEN SHE DELETES 33,000 EMAILS, 

563
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:06,718
AND SHE ACID WASHES, SHE ACID 

564
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:06,951
WASHES. 

565
00:18:06,951 --> 00:18:08,353
THIS WAY, IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE 

566
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,488
PROCESS, NEVER USED. 

567
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:13,492
NEVER USED BECAUSE IT COSTS SO 

568
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:14,226
MUCH. 

569
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:14,793
IT'S CALLED ACID WATCHING. 

570
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:16,828
IT'S CALLED BLEACH BID. 

571
00:18:16,828 --> 00:18:17,996
FIVE DIFFERENT NAMES. 

572
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,264
BUT I LIKE ACID WASHING, 

573
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,165
BECAUSE THAT REALLY SAYS IT. 

574
00:18:21,165 --> 00:18:22,634
SHE ACID WASHES 33,000, SO 

575
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,702
NOBODY CAN EVER FIND THEM. 

576
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:25,470
BUT THEY'RE AROUND SOME PLACE. 

577
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,638
I THINK THAT MAYBE, MAYBE 

578
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,973
THEY'RE AT THE STATE 

579
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:28,273
DEPARTMENT. 

580
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:28,740
THE STATE DEPARTMENT. 

581
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,877
WE HAVE A GREAT MAN NOW AT THE 

582
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,912
STATE DEPARTMENT. 

583
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:38,650
MIKE POMPEO. 

584
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,852
BUT MAYBE THEY'RE AT THE STATE 

585
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:41,386
DEPARTMENT. 

586
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:44,256
THEY COULD VERY WELL BE AT THE 

587
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,357
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, YOU CAN 

588
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:47,292
BELIEVE THAT WHOLE DEAL. 

589
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,793
BUT WE'RE JUST BEING QUIET. 

590
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:49,928
WE'RE BEING QUIET, YOU KNOW 

591
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,463
WHY? 

592
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,298
THERE'S BEEN NO COLLUSION. 

593
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,032
CAN YOU IMAGINE? 

594
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:57,169
LET'S SAY WE'RE LOSING THE 

595
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:57,602
STATE OF MONTANA. 

596
00:18:57,602 --> 00:18:58,870
THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN. 

597
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,906
AND I GET AN URGENT CALL FROM 

598
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:03,108
MY PEOPLE IN MONTANA, AND I'M 

599
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,578
IN NEW YORK, OR I'M IN 

600
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:09,248
WASHINGTON, AND THEY SAY, SIR, 

601
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,349
SIR, WE'RE LOSING THE STATE OF 

602
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:11,616
MONTANA. 

603
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:13,584
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO? 

604
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:18,590
CAN YOU IMAGINE ME SAYING OH, I 

605
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,191
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. 

606
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,360
GEE, LET'S CALL THE RUSSIANS, 

607
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,961
MAYBE THEY CAN HELP. 

608
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,832
NO, CAN YOU BELIEVE THE 

609
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,265
STUPIDITY OF THIS? 

610
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:28,399
LET'S CALL THE RUSSIANS. 

611
00:19:28,399 --> 00:19:29,668
IF I EVER CALLED THE RUSSIANS 

612
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,403
THE FIRST ONE TO KNOW ABOUT IT 

613
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:33,404
WOULD BE THE STATE OF MONTANA, 

614
00:19:33,404 --> 00:19:36,041
AND THEY WOULDN'T BE TOO HAPPY. 

615
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,277
CAN YOU IMAGINE LET'S CALL THE 

616
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:38,677
RUSSIANS? 

617
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,311
IT'S A DISGRACE. 

618
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,080
IT WAS AN EXCUSE MADE BY THE 

619
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,748
DEMOCRATS FOR LOSING AN 

620
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:48,353
ELECTION THAT FRANKLY THEY 

621
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,188
SHOULD WIN, BECAUSE THE 

622
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:50,789
ELECTORAL COLLEGE, REMEMBER, 

623
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:55,894
THERE'S NO WAY TO 270. 

624
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:58,030
I WENT TO, THAT'S EXACTLY 

625
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,330
RIGHT, 306. 

626
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,063
I WENT, THAT'S RIGHT. 

627
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:00,732
HOW MANY TIMES YOU HEARD THERE 

628
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:01,032
IS NO WAY. 

629
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,366
SO I WENT TO MAINE. 

630
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:05,404
I LOVE MAINE, BY THE WAY. 

631
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,205
ONE VOTE. 

632
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:07,505
GOT ONE. 

633
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:07,705
ONE. 

634
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,708
SO I WENT TO MAINE FOUR OR FIVE 

635
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:09,941
TIMES. 

636
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,676
I LOVE THE PEOPLE OF MAINE. 

637
00:20:11,676 --> 00:20:13,745
AND I ENDED UP WINNING THAT 

638
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:13,945
ONE. 

639
00:20:13,945 --> 00:20:15,847
BUT I DIDN'T NEED IT, BECAUSE 

640
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,950
WE WON MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN 

641
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,284
AND PENNSYLVANIA AND A LOT OF 

642
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:21,553
STUFF. 

643
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,887
AND A LOT OF STATES. 

644
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:25,957
NO, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IT WAS 

645
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:29,761
AN EXCITING, IT WAS AN EXCITING 

646
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:29,961
TIME. 

647
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:30,729
AND NEXT TIME DEMOCRATS ARE 

648
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,432
GOING TO LEARN WHERE THEY HAVE 

649
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:34,299
TO RUN. 

650
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:36,334
YOU GOT TO RUN IN THE RIGHT 

651
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:36,567
PLACES. 

652
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,470
THESE WERE NOT GREAT 

653
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:39,004
COMPETITORS. 

654
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:39,838
BUT THEY WERE FUN. 

655
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,440
ACTUALLY, THEY WERE MORE 

656
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,674
EFFECTIVE IN MY OPINION AFTER 

657
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,377
THE ELECTION THAN BEFORE THE 

658
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:45,644
ELECTION. 

659
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,413
DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE? 

660
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,216
YOU KNOW? 

661
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:51,449
SENSE. 

662
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,818
WISE GUYS. 

663
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,120
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TURNED, I 

664
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,991
LOVE YOU TOO, WHO SAID THAT? 

665
00:20:59,991 --> 00:21:01,493
WHO SAID THAT? 

666
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:01,993
WHO SAID THAT? 

667
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:03,127
IT'S FINALLY A WOMAN. 

668
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:08,200
YOU KNOW I GET IT FROM THE MEN 

669
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,533
ALL THE TIME. 

670
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,237
AND SO FAR EVERY GUY THAT SAID 

671
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:15,474
I LOVE YOU, THEY'RE JUST NOT MY 

672
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:15,674
TYPE. 

673
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,611
I FINALLY HEARD IT FROM A 

674
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,345
WOMAN. 

675
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:20,846
THANK YOU. 

676
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:21,146
THANK YOU. 

677
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:23,482
AND LOOK AT ALL THE WOMEN FOR 

678
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:23,815
TRUMP SIGNS. 

679
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,585
HERE WE GO AGAIN, IT'S THE SAME 

680
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,419
THING. 

681
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,354
EVERYONE SAYS BUT WILL HE GET 

682
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:29,755
THE WOMEN? 

683
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,958
THEY EVER TELL YOU THESE FAKERS 

684
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,125
ON TELEVISION, THE PUNDITS, 

685
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,226
REAL GENIUSES, THEY'VE REALLY 

686
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:36,395
DONE WELL IN PREDICTING ME. 

687
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,762
HE'S NEVER GOING TO RUN. 

688
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:39,197
HE HAS TOO GOOD OF A LIFE. 

689
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:42,634
HE'S JUST DOING IT FOR FUN. 

690
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:42,934
NEVER RUN. 

691
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,269
BUT HE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME. 

692
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,638
I SAID THAT'S A GOOD TIME? 

693
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,038
SO I RUN. 

694
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:49,074
THEN SEPTEMBER, ONE BY ONE WE 

695
00:21:49,074 --> 00:21:51,476
KNOCK THEM OFF, KNOCK THEM OFF, 

696
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,880
KNOCK THEM OFF. 

697
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,514
REMEMBER? 

698
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:55,814
18 PEOPLE. 

699
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,181
17 OPPONENTS. 

700
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:56,915
VERY TALENTED OPPONENTS IN MANY 

701
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:57,416
CASES. 

702
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:04,756
NOT IN ALL CASES, BUT IN MANY 

703
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:08,360
CASES. 

704
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,528
I REMEMBER CHARLES KRAUTHIMMER 

705
00:22:10,528 --> 00:22:11,530
AND HE WAS TALKING. 

706
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,998
WELL HE TREATED YOU BETTER THAN 

707
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,299
HE TREATED ME, THAT'S OKAY. 

708
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:17,636
BUT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE 

709
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:17,936
FIELD. 

710
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:18,370
I HADN'T ENTERED. 

711
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,840
AND HE SAID WHY WOULD HE DO 

712
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,774
THIS? 

713
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:26,011
THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST 

714
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:26,845
FIELD OF REPUBLICANS EVER 

715
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,146
ASSEMBLED FOR ANELECTION, AND I 

716
00:22:28,146 --> 00:22:28,880
LOOKED AT MY LIFE. 

717
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,716
BY THE WAY, HOW GREAT IS OUR 

718
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:32,016
FIRST LADY? 

719
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:33,284
IS SHE DOING GREAT? 

720
00:22:33,284 --> 00:22:34,553
PEOPLE LOVE OUR FIRST LADY. 

721
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,389
LOOK AT ALL THE SIGNS, WE LOVE 

722
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:37,756
OUR FIRST LADY. 

723
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,491
WE LOVE OUR FIRST LADY. 

724
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,060
JUST CAME BACK FROM AFRICA. 

725
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,362
JUST CAME BACK FROM AFRICA AND 

726
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,231
SHE GOT GREAT PEOPLE. 

727
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,300
THEY LOVE HER. 

728
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,369
SHE WENT INTO AREAS THAT IT WAS 

729
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,304
SAD BECAUSE SUCH POVERTY. 

730
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:54,873
SHE WENT IN WITH HER ARMS WIDE 

731
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,508
OPEN, AND THE "NEW YORK TIMES" 

732
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,577
AND SOME OTHERS, ALL THEY COULD 

733
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:05,116
TALK ABOUT, SHE WORE A CERTAIN 

734
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:05,349
HAT. 

735
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:06,651
AND THEY SAID, IT REPRESENTED A 

736
00:23:06,651 --> 00:23:07,285
COLONIALIZATION, AND EVERYBODY 

737
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,420
WAS TRYING TO FIGURE, AND I 

738
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,222
THINK IT CAME OUT OF LOS 

739
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,122
ANGELES. 

740
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,290
I THINK THEY ACTUALLY BOUGHT IT 

741
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,825
IN LOS ANGELES. 

742
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:16,294
BUT THEY LOVE THE JOB SHE'S 

743
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:16,527
DOING. 

744
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:19,030
AND YESTERDAY THEY HAD A 

745
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,397
PROBLEM, RIGHT? 

746
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:22,600
YOU SAW THAT FIRE ON THE PLANE. 

747
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,702
AND I GOT A CALL, SIR, YOUR 

748
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,871
WIFE IS UP IN THE AIR. 

749
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,539
THERE'S A FIRE ON THE PLANE. 

750
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,541
I SAID DON'T TELL ME THAT. 

751
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:30,608
DON'T TELL ME. 

752
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:34,245
AND THEY CAME DOWN QUICKLY. 

753
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:34,579
GREAT PEOPLE. 

754
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,581
GREAT PILOTS. 

755
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:39,184
GREAT PILOTS. 

756
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,419
THEN SHE WAS COOL. 

757
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,220
SHE WAS COOL. 

758
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,623
I DID HAVE TO, ONCE I FOUND 

759
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,158
OUT, I ASKED HOW WAS SHE? 

760
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:48,193
WAS SHE SCARED? 

761
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:48,426
NO SIR. 

762
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,595
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE? 

763
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,931
SHE WAS SO COOL WE COULDN'T 

764
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,231
BELIEVE IT. 

765
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,900
EVERYBODY ELSE HAD CLOTH ON 

766
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,936
THEIR FACE, AND I PROBABLY 

767
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,670
WOULD HAVE ALSO. 

768
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,071
CLOTH THAT WAS WATER, RIGHT? 

769
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,673
WET ON THEIR FACE. 

770
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:03,542
SHE SAT THERE, WHAT ELSE IS 

771
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:03,742
NEW? 

772
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:07,178
SHE'S A GREAT FIRST LADY. 

773
00:24:07,178 --> 00:24:10,582
SHE'S DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 

774
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,617
AND YOU THINK IT'S EASY FOR HER 

775
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,753
TO BE A FIRST LADY. 

776
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,154
NOT SO EASY. 

777
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:20,558
SHE'S DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB. 

778
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:21,693
BUT CHARLES SAID THERE'S NEVER 

779
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,629
BEEN A FIELD LIKE THIS, AND I 

780
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,131
ACTUALLY WENT TO MY WIFE AND 

781
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,400
SAID YOU KNOW, A VERY SMART MAN 

782
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,035
JUST SAID THERE'S NEVER BEEN A 

783
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,336
FIELD AS TALENTED AS THIS. 

784
00:24:31,336 --> 00:24:33,438
NOW A LOT OF THEM ARE FRIENDS 

785
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:33,705
OF MINE. 

786
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,574
ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE FRIENDS 

787
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:35,974
OF MINE. 

788
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,676
YOU GO THROUGH WARS TOGETHER, 

789
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:38,610
AND IF YOU'RE SMART, AND 

790
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,978
THEY'RE SMART, YOU GET ALONG. 

791
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:42,147
I HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS. 

792
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,215
TED CRUZ HAS BECOME A FRIEND OF 

793
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:44,416
MINE. 

794
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:49,620
HE'S DOING GREAT IN TEXAS. 

795
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:49,954
MARCO RUBIO. 

796
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:50,321
CHRIS CHRISTIE. 

797
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:53,124
MIKE HUCKABEE, HE WAS IN THERE 

798
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:53,691
AT THE BEGINNING. 

799
00:24:53,691 --> 00:24:57,495
REMEMBER, HE GOT UP? 

800
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,197
AND HE SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT 

801
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,266
YOU GUYS ARE WASTING YOUR TIME 

802
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:01,499
FOR. 

803
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:03,568
NOBODY'S GOING TO BEAT TRUMP. 

804
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:05,069
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? 

805
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,771
YOU CAN'T BEAT HIM. 

806
00:25:06,771 --> 00:25:10,609
IN FACT, YOU REMEMBER, IN FACT, 

807
00:25:10,609 --> 00:25:12,544
I JUST WENT OUT, AND I'M 

808
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,079
DROPPING OUT AFTER THIS DEBATE, 

809
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,681
BUT NONE OF YOU GUYS ARE GOING 

810
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,048
TO BEAT TRUMP. 

811
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,085
THAT WAS MIKE HUCKABEE. 

812
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:20,552
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. 

813
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,654
THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. 

814
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:24,989
IT WAS VERY GOOD FOR ME EGO. 

815
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:29,060
IN FACT, THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 

816
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:29,661
MY BEST DEBATE. 

817
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,329
NO MIKE IS GREAT. 

818
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:33,564
WE HAVE SUCH GREAT PEOPLE. 

819
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:35,567
WE HAVE SUCH GREAT PEOPLE AND A 

820
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,702
LOT OF TALENTED PEOPLE, AND THE 

821
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,004
END RESULT IS THIS IS WHERE WE 

822
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:40,338
ARE. 

823
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,239
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TRULY TURNED 

824
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,075
INTO AN ANGRY MOB. 

825
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,511
BENT ON DESTROYING ANYTHING OR 

826
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:49,447
ANYONE IN THEIR PATH, AND YOUR  

827
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,182
SENATOR IS ONE OF THEM. 

828
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,152
LET ME TELL YOU, YOUR SUPPORT 

829
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,389
IS DISGRACEFUL WHAT HE DID. 

830
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,190
THIS ELECTION YOU WILL DECIDE 

831
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,394
WHICH PARTY IS IN CONTROL OF 

832
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:02,661
CONGRESS. 

833
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:02,994
THAT'S TRUE. 

834
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,929
AND IF THEY WIN, EVEN IF THEY 

835
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,165
WIN THE HOUSE, IT'S GOING TO BE 

836
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,501
JUST FIGHTING, FIGHTING, 

837
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,301
FIGHTING. 

838
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:12,237
IT'S GOING TO BE, WE'LL BE, YOU 

839
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,472
LOVE MY HAIR? 

840
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:15,240
THANK YOU. 

841
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,508
SHE KNOWS WHAT TO SAY. 

842
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:19,844
SHE KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ME HAPPY. 

843
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,047
I LOVE YOUR HAIR. 

844
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,917
WELL THE ONE THING THAT HAS 

845
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,051
BEEN REALLY GREAT ABOUT THIS 

846
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,586
WHOLE ENDEAVOR, THEY USED TO 

847
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,021
SAY, HE WEARS A HAIR PIECE. 

848
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:32,523
THEY DON'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. 

849
00:26:32,523 --> 00:26:35,727
THESE PEOPLE HAVE SEEN ME UNDER 

850
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:36,961
EVERY CONDITION KNOWNTO MAN. 

851
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:39,364
I HAVEN'T HEARD THAT ONE IN 

852
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:39,697
OVER A YEAR. 

853
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:42,233
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING AROUND, AND 

854
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,435
THE WIND IS GOING CRAZY, AND 

855
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,969
YOU'RE EXPECTING LIKE I DID THE 

856
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:49,207
OTHER DAY, THE INCREDIBLE 

857
00:26:49,207 --> 00:26:49,507
HURRICANE. 

858
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,343
THIS HORRIBLE HURRICANE MICHAEL 

859
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,177
THAT DEVASTATED FLORIDA AND 

860
00:26:53,177 --> 00:26:53,478
GEORGIA. 

861
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,979
AND ALABAMA GOT HIT HARD. 

862
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:56,147
AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS BEFORE, 

863
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:58,049
AND MICHAEL GOT A PIECE OF THEM 

864
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,718
TOO, BUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS 

865
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:00,986
BEFORE I WENT TO NORTH 

866
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:01,519
CAROLINA, SOUTH CAROLINA. 

867
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,988
YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN A 

868
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:06,291
LITTLE PIECE OF VIRGINIA AND 

869
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,224
YOU WALK AROUND IN THOSE 

870
00:27:07,224 --> 00:27:09,059
CONDITIONS, YOU CAN'T FAKE IT. 

871
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:10,228
YOU CAN'T FAKE IT. 

872
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,796
SO THAT'S ONE GOOD THING. 

873
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,097
NOBODY EVER SAYS THAT ANYMORE. 

874
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:14,899
THAT'S ONE OF THE, MIGHT BE ONE 

875
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,468
OF THE BEST THINGS THAT'S 

876
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,836
HAPPENED TO ME IN A LONG TIME. 

877
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:21,072
BECAUSE MY WHOLE LIFE, THEY 

878
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:24,175
SAID IS IT OR ISN'T IT? 

879
00:27:24,175 --> 00:27:25,009
BARBARA WALTERS INTERVIEWED ME, 

880
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:29,080
DO YOU MIND IF I PLAY WITH YOUR 

881
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,514
HAIR? 

882
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:29,881
REMEMBER THAT? 

883
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,216
AND THEN NUMEROUS PEOPLE HAVE 

884
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:31,716
DONE THAT. 

885
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,251
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 

886
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:39,491
BUT THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE 

887
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,493
MORE CLEAR. 

888
00:27:42,493 --> 00:28:04,549
DEMOCRATS  

889
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,317
>> BY THE WAY, THIS IS THE MOST 

890
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,754
BEAUTIFUL SKY.  

891
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:13,391
WELL -- BIG SKY -- I GUESS 

892
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:14,793
THERE IS A REASON FOR 

893
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:18,296
EVERYTHING . I GOT OUT AND I'M 

894
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:19,731
LOOKING . I HAVE BEEN HERE MANY 

895
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,232
TIMES BUT I GOT OUT AND I AM 

896
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,267
LOOKING . THAT REALLY IS 

897
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,802
BEAUTIFUL . NOT JUST ME, IT IS 

898
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,838
BEAUTIFUL -- SKY . SOMEDAY, ONE 

899
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,039
OF YOU WILL EXPLAIN EXACTLY 

900
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,808
WHY, BUT THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL, 

901
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:32,243
BEAUTIFUL, BIG SKY.  

902
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:39,584
BUT, NANCY PELOSI, CRYING CHUCK 

903
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,718
SCHUMER AND THE RADICAL 

904
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,419
DEMOCRATS WANT TO RAISE YOUR 

905
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,754
TAXES, THEY WANT TO IMPOSE 

906
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,255
SOCIALISM ON OUR INCREDIBLE 

907
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:48,359
NATION, MAKE IT AN AS WELL, 

908
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,794
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WILL 

909
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:54,065
HAPPEN . I WANT TO TAKE AWAY 

910
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,066
YOUR HEALTHCARE, BECAUSE YOU 

911
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,367
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE IT, 

912
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:57,902
OUR COUNTRY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 

913
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,903
AFFORD IT . DESTROY YOUR SECOND 

914
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,238
AMENDMENT, AND THROW OPEN YOUR 

915
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,407
BORDERS TO DEADLY DRUGS AND 

916
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,578
VICIOUS GANGS . BECAUSE PLENTY 

917
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,345
OF THEM ARE COMING ACROSS WITH 

918
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:10,181
A LOT OF DRUGS . DEMOCRATS HAVE 

919
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,482
BECOME THE PARTY OF CRIME . IT 

920
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:14,752
IS TRUE . WHO WOULD BELIEVE YOU 

921
