1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,600
AMERICANS HEAD TO THE POLL.

2
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:07,736
WE ARE IN COUNT-DOWN MODE.

3
00:00:07,737 --> 00:00:12,874
JOINING ME IS THE HOUSE MAJORITY

4
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:13,975
LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY.

5
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:16,811
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME BACK.

6
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:19,080
>> HERE WE ARE, 23 DAYS A WAY

7
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:20,882
FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTION.

8
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:22,517
YOU HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THE

9
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:24,119
COUNTRY TO SUPPORT YOUR

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,887
COLLEAGUES IN DIFFERENT RACES AS

11
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:28,990
WELL AS RAISING A HUGE AMOUNT OF

12
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:30,725
MONEY FOR YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE

13
00:00:30,726 --> 00:00:31,760
REPUBLICAN PARTY.

14
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:34,062
WHERE DO YOU SEED THE MIDTERMS

15
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:34,462
HEADED?

16
00:00:34,463 --> 00:00:36,798
>> I THINK THEY HAVE CHANGED IN

17
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:37,699
THE LAST MONTH.

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,570
THE INTENSITY LEVEL, THERE WAS

19
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:44,206
AN ADVANTAGE ON THE DEMOCRATIC

20
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:44,906
SIDE.

21
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,742
THAT HAS CHANGED AFTER WHAT THEY

22
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:49,244
DID TO KAVANAUGH.

23
00:00:49,245 --> 00:00:53,815
THERE IS A REAL CONCERN BECAUSE

24
00:00:53,816 --> 00:00:56,051
MICHEAL BLOOMBURG WHO

25
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:57,052
REREGISTERED A DEMOCRAT IS

26
00:00:57,053 --> 00:00:59,287
TRYING TO BUY THE NOMINATION TO

27
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:01,122
RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP.

28
00:01:01,123 --> 00:01:03,124
HE'S PUT IN 80 MILLION DOLLARS

29
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,359
TO WIN THE HOUSE.

30
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,194
THE PRESIDENT WAS JUST THERE IN

31
00:01:06,195 --> 00:01:06,595
KENTUCKY.

32
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,630
THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST RACES

33
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,432
YOU WILL WANT TO WATCH.

34
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:12,067
AMY IN HER OWN WORDS.

35
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:14,703
THIS IS HOW SHE DESCRIBES

36
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:15,403
HERSELF.

37
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:17,906
THE MOST LIBERAL DEMOCRAT IN

38
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:18,273
KENTUCKY.

39
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:19,941
THIS WILL BE A BATTLE BECAUSE OF

40
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:21,776
THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE AGAINST

41
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,312
US BUT THE NUMBER OF OUR

42
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:26,047
CANDIDATES ARE DOING WELL AND

43
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:29,985
GOTTEN A BUMP IN THE LAST FEW

44
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:30,452
WEEKS.

45
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:31,720
>> IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU

46
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:32,721
LOOK AT THAT.

47
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:34,556
THE DEMOCRATS SAID THEY WERE THE

48
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:36,191
PARTY OF THE AMERICAN WORKER.

49
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:38,093
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DONATIONS

50
00:01:38,094 --> 00:01:39,394
INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY YOU

51
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:41,630
ARE BEATING THE DEMOCRATS IN

52
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:42,664
THAT REGARD.

53
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:45,800
THEY HAVE A HANDFUL OF BIG DEEP

54
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:48,937
POCKETED DONORS LIKE MICHEAL

55
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:50,605
BLOOMBURG.

56
00:01:50,606 --> 00:01:52,374
>> JUST THINK, THE THREE

57
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:54,309
INDIVIDUALS FUNDING THE

58
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,610
INDIVIDUAL PARTY.

59
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:59,147
YOU HAVE MICHEAL BLOOMBURG, IT'S

60
00:01:59,148 --> 00:02:02,083
NOT JUST 80 IN THE HOUSE BUT 20

61
00:02:02,084 --> 00:02:03,618
MILLION TO WIN THE SENATE.

62
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:06,821
THEN TOM, MORE THEN $120 MILLION

63
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:08,456
HE SPENT TRYING TO WIN.

64
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:10,292
HIS GOAL IS TRYING TO IMPEACH

65
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:11,126
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

66
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:13,928
HE BRAGS THAT HIS IMPEACHMENT

67
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:17,365
LIST IS BIGGER THAN AN NRA LIST.

68
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:19,200
THOSE THREE INDIVIDUALS ARE

69
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,835
TRYING TO BUY OUR GOVERNMENT IN

70
00:02:20,836 --> 00:02:22,037
THE PROCESS.

71
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:23,338
IT'S VERY DISTURBING.

72
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:27,175
>> I WANT TO GET TO YOUR BILL.

73
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:29,244
BUILD THE WALL AND ENFORCE THE

74
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:30,045
LAW, YEAH.

75
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,980
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE

76
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,581
IMPORTANT RACES YOU ARE

77
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:33,948
WATCHING.

78
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:36,017
YOU MENTIONED KENTUCKY.

79
00:02:36,018 --> 00:02:40,322
WHAT RACES SHOULD WE WATCH?

80
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:42,590
>> FIRST, WATCH, WHERE COULD THE

81
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:45,026
REPUBLICANS DEFEAT A DEMOCRAT.

82
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:47,762
I LIKE AT MINNESOTA.

83
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:50,265
THOSE ARE TWO SEATS DEMOCRATS

84
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:51,900
CURRENTLY HOLD THAT WE ARE IN A

85
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,134
GOOD FIGHT TO WIN.

86
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:56,671
YOU ALSO WANT TO WATCH, FOR YOUR

87
00:02:56,672 --> 00:02:57,872
VIEWERS, WHERE COULD THEY HELP

88
00:02:57,873 --> 00:03:00,675
IN THE PROCESS THIS BLOOMBURG

89
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:01,843
MONEY COMING IN.

90
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:06,781
IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE SPENDING

91
00:03:06,782 --> 00:03:07,182
$10 MILLION.

92
00:03:07,183 --> 00:03:09,517
LOOK AT THE OPEN SEAT.

93
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:12,754
THERE IS YOUNG KIM RUNNING

94
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:15,390
AGAINST GILL WHO WAS ACCUSED

95
00:03:15,391 --> 00:03:18,026
EARLIER OF THIS YEAR FROM A

96
00:03:18,027 --> 00:03:20,562
DEMOCRAT OF SEXUAL HAAR

97
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:20,929
HAASMENT.

98
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,197
YOUNG KIM IS LEADING.

99
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:24,499
WE HAVE SEVEN SEATS IN

100
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,233
CALIFORNIA.

101
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:28,470
I'VE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH MONEY

102
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:29,904
BEING SPENT.

103
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:32,173
GO TO BARBARA WHO IS STILL IN

104
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:34,743
THE LEAD AND BEEN A BIG FIGHTER.

105
00:03:34,744 --> 00:03:38,079
THEN, THINK OF THIS, BLOOMBURG

106
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,515
SENT $1 MILLION AGAINST KAREN

107
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,150
HANDLE OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA.

108
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:44,586
SHE WON THE BIG SPECIAL ELECTION

109
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:45,920
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

110
00:03:45,921 --> 00:03:48,757
SHE'S ONE OF THE HARDEST WORKING

111
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:51,760
FRESHMAN AND MOST SUCCESSFUL

112
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:54,095
LEGISLATIVELY WE'VE HAD.

113
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:56,331
LOOK AT THE OPEN SEAT IN MIAMI

114
00:03:56,332 --> 00:03:58,366
THAT'S AN HIGHLY SPANISH

115
00:03:58,367 --> 00:04:00,001
SPEAKING DISTRICT THAT DEMOCRATS

116
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:01,836
THOUGHT THEY WOULD PICK UP

117
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:02,170
EASILY.

118
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:04,939
THEY NOMINATED DONNA, REMEMBER

119
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,075
HER FROM THE CLINTON

120
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:07,542
ADMINISTRATION.

121
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:12,247
WE HAVE MARIA SALAZAR.

122
00:04:12,248 --> 00:04:17,085
SHE WAS A REPORTER ON UNIVISION

123
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:19,621
AND TELEMONDO.

124
00:04:19,622 --> 00:04:22,557
WE NEED THE INTENSITY LEVEL.

125
00:04:22,558 --> 00:04:24,793
WE HAVE A DISADVANTAGE WITH

126
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:25,193
MONEY.

127
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:26,995
WE'LL BEAT HISTORY, WHY?

128
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:29,364
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE

129
00:04:29,365 --> 00:04:33,001
ECONOMY AND V.A.  REBUILDING THE

130
00:04:33,002 --> 00:00:00,000
MILITARY RE.
