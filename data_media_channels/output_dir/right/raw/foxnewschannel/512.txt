00:00:01,257 --> 00:00:01,657
INTERVIEWS?

2
00:00:01,657 --> 00:00:02,091
>> YES, MA'AM.

3
00:00:02,091 --> 00:00:03,359
>> SENATOR DURBIN.

4
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:06,429
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

5
00:00:06,429 --> 00:00:08,765
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

6
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:11,000
DR. CHRISTINE FORD SET IN THAT

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,835
CHAIR AND SHE SAID CLEARLY THAT

8
00:00:12,835 --> 00:00:14,637
SHE WAS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL

9
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:16,239
ASSAULT OF YOUR HANDS.

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,741
SHE ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS

11
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:25,515
DIRECTLY, AND SHE DIDN'T FLINCH

12
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:27,784
AT THE PROSPECT OF AN FBI

13
00:00:27,784 --> 00:00:28,217
INVESTIGATION.

14
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:29,519
WE KNOW AND SHE'S BEEN ADVISED

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,354
THAT A PERSON LYING TO THE FBI

16
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:34,090
CAN FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.

17
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,259
YOU HAVE CLEARLY AND

18
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:37,660
UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED THAT YOU

19
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,128
ASSAULTED DR. FORD.

20
00:00:39,128 --> 00:00:40,496
WITH THAT STATEMENT, YOU MUST

21
00:00:40,496 --> 00:00:42,498
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO

22
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,000
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OR ANY

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,636
CREDIBLE WITNESS THAT CAN PROVE

24
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:47,036
OTHERWISE.

25
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:48,838
YOU STARTED OFF WITH AN

26
00:00:48,838 --> 00:00:50,139
IMPASSIONED STATEMENT AT THE

27
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:51,407
BEGINNING AND I CAN IMAGINE, TRY

28
00:00:51,407 --> 00:00:52,342
TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

29
00:00:52,342 --> 00:00:53,643
THROUGH AND YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN

30
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:54,877
THROUGH AND I'M SURE I WOULDN'T

31
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:55,612
GET CLOSE TO IT.

32
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:56,279
BUT IT WAS --

33
00:00:56,279 --> 00:00:57,580
>> YOU WOULDN'T.

34
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,182
>> I'M SURE I WOULDN'T.

35
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:00,650
IT'S AN IMPASSIONED STATEMENT.

36
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,186
IN THE COURSE OF IT, YOU SAID "I

37
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:05,355
WELCOME ANY KIND OF

38
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:05,822
INVESTIGATION."

39
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:06,556
I QUOTE YOU.

40
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:09,659
I WELCOME ANY KIND OF

41
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:10,093
INVESTIGATION.

42
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:12,729
I'VE GOT A SUGGESTION FOR YOU.

43
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,198
RIGHT NOW, TURN TO YOUR LEFT IN

44
00:01:15,198 --> 00:01:17,934
THE FRONT ROW TO DON McGAHN,

45
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:19,235
COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND

46
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:21,771
ASK HIM TO SUSPEND THIS HEARING

47
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:23,940
AND NOMINATION PROCESS UNTIL THE

48
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,575
FBI COMPLETES ITS INVESTIGATION

49
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:28,078
OF THE CHARGES MADE BY DR. FORD

50
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,547
AND OTHERS AND GOES TO BRING THE

51
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:32,916
WITNESSES FORWARD AND PROVIDES

52
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:34,718
THAT INFORMATION TO THIS

53
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:35,051
HEARING.

54
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,053
I'M SURE THAT THE CHAIRMAN AT

55
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:38,955
THAT POINT WILL UNDERSTAND THAT

56
00:01:38,955 --> 00:01:40,857
THAT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST TO

57
00:01:40,857 --> 00:01:42,158
FINALLY PUT TO REST THESE

58
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:43,860
CHARGES IF THEY ARE FALSE OR TO

59
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,562
PROVE THEM IF THEY ARE NOT.

60
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,665
YOU SPENT TWO YEARS IN THE WHITE

61
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:50,800
HOUSE OFFICE THAT PROVED

62
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,735
JUDICIAL NOMINEES.

63
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:53,536
YOU TURNED TO THE FIB OVER AND

64
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,505
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THEIR

65
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:55,805
WORK.

66
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,841
LET'S BRING THEM IN HERE AND

67
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:58,108
NOW.

68
00:01:58,108 --> 00:01:59,776
TURN TO DON McGAHN AND TELL HIM

69
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,211
IT'S TIME TO GET THIS DONE.

70
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:03,180
AN FBI INVESTIGATION IS THE ONLY

71
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,549
WAY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS.

72
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,618
>> SENATOR --

73
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:10,054
>> STOP THE TALK.

74
00:02:10,054 --> 00:02:12,623
THIS COMMITTEE IS RUNNING THIS

75
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:12,990
HEARING.

76
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,758
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT DON

77
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:18,162
McGAHN, NOT EVEN YOU AS A

78
00:02:18,162 --> 00:02:22,032
NOMINEE.

79
00:02:22,032 --> 00:02:25,235
WE'RE -- WE ARE HERE TODAY

80
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:26,537
BECAUSE DR. FORD ASKED FOR AN

81
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:27,204
OPPORTUNITY HERE.

82
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:28,906
I KNOW YOU DID TOO AS WELL.

83
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:32,109
IN FACT, MAYBE EVEN BEFORE SHE

84
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:32,943
DID.

85
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,845
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED

86
00:02:34,845 --> 00:02:37,481
TO BE HEARD FROM CHARGES THAT

87
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,517
THEY ALL THOUGHT WERE UNFAIR OR

88
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:42,119
ACTIVITIES LIKE SEXUAL ASSAULT

89
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,053
WAS UNFAIR.

90
00:02:43,053 --> 00:02:45,556
SO I WANT TO ASSURE SENATOR

91
00:02:45,556 --> 00:02:48,359
DURBIN REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU

92
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,562
SAY TO SENATOR -- DON McGAHN,

93
00:02:51,562 --> 00:02:53,263
WE'RE NOT SUSPENDING THIS

94
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:54,431
HEARING.

95
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:56,400
PROCEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION

96
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,269
OR WHATEVER OR IF THE --

97
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:01,772
>> I JUST SAY THIS.

98
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:06,043
IF YOU, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, TURNS

99
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:08,979
TO DON McGAHN AND TO THIS

100
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:10,180
COMMITTEE AND TO GET TO THE

101
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,915
BOTTOM OF THE TRUTH OF THIS, I'M

102
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:14,418
NOT GOING TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO

103
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:16,553
AN FBI INVESTIGATION, I HOPE ALL

104
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:17,821
THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

105
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:19,523
WOULD SAY WE'RE GOING TO ABIDE

106
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:20,558
BY YOUR WISHES AND WE'LL HAVE

107
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:21,692
THAT INVESTIGATION.

108
00:03:21,692 --> 00:03:22,760
>> I WELCOME WHATEVER THE

109
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,527
COMMITTEE WANTS TO DO.

110
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:24,728
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

111
00:03:24,728 --> 00:03:25,863
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT

112
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:26,397
TO DO.

113
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:27,665
>> I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

114
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,633
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT

115
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,202
TO DO.

116
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:34,205
>> I'M INNOCENT.

117
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:35,573
THEY DON'T REACH CONCLUSIONS.

118
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:38,242
YOU REACH CONCLUSIONS.

119
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:39,076
>> THEY INVESTIGATE.

120
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:43,280
>> YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

121
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,983
CAN'T SAY THAT I WELCOME --

122
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:47,818
>> THIS WAS SPRUNG ON ME AT THE

123
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:50,955
LAST MINUTE AND AFTER BEING HELD

124
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:53,424
BY STAFF, YOU KNOW, AND I CALLED

125
00:03:53,424 --> 00:03:55,192
FOR A HEARING IMMEDIATELY.

126
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:57,962
>> IF THERE'S NO TRUTH TO HER

127
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:00,331
CHARGES, THE FBI INVESTIGATION

128
00:04:00,331 --> 00:04:01,398
WILL SHOW THAT.

129
00:04:01,398 --> 00:04:04,535
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT

130
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:04,802
NOT?

131
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,871
>> THE FBI DOES NOT REACH -- YOU

132
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,405
KNOW THIS IS -- YOU KNOW THAT'S

133
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:09,340
A PHONY QUESTION.

134
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,175
THE FBI DOESN'T REACH

135
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:11,575
CONCLUSIONS.

136
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:13,978
THEY PROVIDE THE 302s.

137
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:15,579
302s, SO I CAN EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE

138
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:16,981
THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,

139
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,716
THEY JUST GO AND DO WHAT YOU'RE

140
00:04:19,716 --> 00:04:20,785
DOING.

141
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:22,019
ASK QUESTIONS AND TYPE UP A

142
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:22,353
RECORD.

143
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:23,320
THEY DON'T --

144
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,422
>> THERE MORNING I ASKED

145
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:25,923
DR. FORD ABOUT THIS INCIDENT

146
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:27,792
WHERE SHE RAN TO MARK JUDGE AT

147
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:28,125
SAFEWAY.

148
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,261
SHE SAID SURE, I REMEMBER THAT.

149
00:04:30,261 --> 00:04:31,896
SIX WEEKS AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE.

150
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,565
WELL, SOMEONE AT THE "WASHINGTON

151
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,267
POST" WENT IN AND TOOK A LOOK AT

152
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,802
MANY JUDGE'S BOOK AND HAS BEEN

153
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:39,704
ABLE TO -- THE RUN THAT HE ROW

154
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:41,072
ABOUT HIS ADDICTION AND

155
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:41,472
ALCOHOLISM.

156
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:42,940
THEY HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN WHAT

157
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,542
THEY THINK WAS A PERIOD OF TIME,

158
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,777
THE SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AFTER THE

159
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:47,078
EVENT.

160
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,713
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING AT

161
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:50,248
THE SAFEWAY AT THAT POINT.

162
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,383
SO THE POINT I'M GETTING TO, WE

163
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:55,186
AT LEAST CAN CONNECT SOME DOTS

164
00:04:55,186 --> 00:04:56,788
HERE AND GET SOME INFORMATION.

165
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:57,421
WHY --

166
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:58,122
>> THERE'S NO DOTS.

167
00:04:58,122 --> 00:04:59,891
>> WHY WOULD YOU RESIST THAT

168
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,625
INVESTIGATION?

169
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,560
>> SENATOR, I WELCOME -- I

170
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,795
WANTED THE HEARING LAST WEEK.

171
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:05,663
>> I'M ASKING ABOUT THE FBI

172
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,097
INVESTIGATION.

173
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,331
>> THE COMMITTEE FIGURES OUT HOW

174
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,166
TO ASK THE QUESTIONS.

175
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,634
I'LL DO WHATEVER.

176
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:15,006
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE MULTIPLE

177
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:15,740
TIMES --

178
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,341
>> WILL YOU SUPPORT AN FBI

179
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:18,042
INVESTIGATION --

180
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:19,444
>> I'LL DO WHATEVER THE

181
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:19,911
COMMITTEE --

182
00:05:19,911 --> 00:05:20,978
>> PERSONALLY DO YOU THINK THAT

183
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:28,987
IS THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO?

184
00:05:28,987 --> 00:05:30,855
>> YOU WON'T ANSWER?

185
00:05:30,855 --> 00:05:34,258
>> LOOK, SENATOR, I -- I'VE SAID

186
00:05:34,258 --> 00:05:35,159
I WANTED A HEARING.

187
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:37,628
SAID I WAS WELCOME TO ANYTHING.

188
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,631
I'M INNOCENT.

189
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,866
THIS THING WAS -- HELD, HELD

190
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,101
WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN

191
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:44,602
PRESENTED IN THE ORDINARY WAY.

192
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:46,404
IT COULD HAVE BEEN HELD AND

193
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:48,206
HANDLED CONFIDENTIALLY AT FIRST,

194
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:50,608
WHICH IS WHAT DR. FORD'S WISHES

195
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,943
WERE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

196
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:54,346
IT WOULDN'T HAVE CAUSED THIS --

197
00:05:54,346 --> 00:05:57,082
DESTROYED MY FAMILY LIKE THIS

198
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:57,916
EFFORT HAS.

199
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,085
>> I THINK AN FBI INVESTIGATION

200
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:03,088
WILL HELP ALL OF US ON BOTH

201
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:05,991
SIDES OF THE ISSUE.

202
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,894
>> SENATOR GRAHAM ASKED FOR THE

203
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:09,194
FLOOR.

204
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:13,064
BEFORE HE DOES, IT SEEMS TO ME

205
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:15,166
THAT -- IF YOU WANT TO KNOW

206
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,801
SOMETHING, YOU HAVE THE WITNESS

207
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:18,670
RIGHT HERE TO ASK HIM.

208
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,072
SECONDLY IF YOU WANT AN FBI

209
00:06:21,072 --> 00:00:00,000
REPORT, YOU CAN ASK FOR IT
