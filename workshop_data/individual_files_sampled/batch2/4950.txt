joining me now Richard Haass president of the Council on Foreign Relations and author of a world in disarray American foreign policy and the crisis of the old order and MSNBC national security analyst Jeremy bash former chief of staff to Leon Panetta at the CIA and the Pentagon Richard Haass your presciently named book which we've been talking about for the last few years as it's come out in paperback as well because this is what we're seeing now the world in disarray except for perhaps on North Korea possible breakthrough we're expecting Bibi Netanyahu is going to be giving a speech at one o'clock Eastern eight o'clock in Israel he according to my sources and other sources is going to be announcing major new concerns about cheating on weapons or the nuclear program in Iran this only days away from our next deadline where the president is expected to not continue waving sanctions on Iran and is facing huge pressure from Europe and and other allies to continue the Iran deal but he is threatening to blow it up Richard where do we stand right now on that after McCrone and Merkel's visit well we have a rather bizarre situation here we have an unsettled nuclear situation with North Korea and they're seen there's hopes it may be on its way to getting resolved I emphasize the word hopes in May my hunch is the optimists are getting way ahead of themselves here and with Iran we have at least a temporarily if not solved I would call it parked nuclear situation which we seem well on our way now to unraveling and the Israeli government is no fan of this agreement nor is the American president though interestingly Israeli intelligence leaders at least up to now they've been pretty consistent in saying that Iran is complying with the with the agreement but my guess is Andrea that we are headed between now and May 12th towards the United States moving away from the so-called jcpoa the Iran nuclear agreement and I think a lots going to matter on the on the details of exactly how we move away because it could spark not so much for crisis with Iran but as you know it could exacerbate the problem with the Europeans because the principle American reaction could be economic sanctions against those doing business with Iran and we you know have this powerful argument from a Crone but when he was leaving he was telling a number of us who were sitting with him right before he took off that he thought it likely the president would blow it up I talked to another diplomat just in the last couple of days saying that he thinks maybe there's a 5% chance of a compromise some White House officials are hinting that he could say that there will be a reassertion of sanctions but not imposed them immediately giving the Europeans some time to come up with an alternative rouhani and the Iranians are saying that they will break out of it if the president does Jeremy bash here Russia is involved in this McCrone has been talking to Putin is there the possibility of coming out with some sort of compromise I think the deadline is Tidy Andrea and let's see what Bibi Netanyahu says at the top of the hour because in 2009 Israel was the country that came forward with the new intelligence about the centrifuges at ghom at Ford oh those centrifuges that were part of Iran's nuclear weapons program we had thought that they shut down their weapons program in 2003 so we have to see the evidence that the Israeli government is putting forward at the top of the hour I suspect Andrea it's going to be something about weaponization because there three parts to a nuclear program delivery and we know iran's been working on ballistic missiles centrifuges in creating fissile material and the Iran deal has really in some ways taking care of that by pouring concrete into reactors and by removing centrifuges but weaponization is very hard to detect I'm talking about creating a warhead through computer modeling simulation actually fashioning the warhead that would go on top of the nuclear weapon if Israel has concrete evidence of that that would be a major breach of Iran's award and that could spark this unraveling of the deal and at the same time John Bolton let's take a look at this John Bolton speaking about the Libyan model as the sort of predicate for what could be done with North Korea but the Libyan model involved Qadhafi giving up his nukes giving up his centrifuges to Condoleezza down in Tennessee and then ended up becoming being toppled and killed let's see a bit of the new National Security Adviser in his first Sunday show appearances we had very much in mind the Libya model from 2003 2004 there are obviously differences the living program was much smaller the full complete total disclosure of everything related to their nuclear weapons program with that full international verification and I think following Libya a verification by American and other inspectors is could be very important here which is what they're saying they want from North Korea is it credible that after cheating twice under Clinton and under Bush Bush 43 that North Korea would really give up everything and that we could verify that they'd given up everything that's buried underground Richard is it conceivable yes but you'd have to have a pretty good imagination my guess is you know the Libya example and also the Ukraine example also the Iraqi example or push North Korea in the direction of not giving up their nuclear weapons it's easy it's interesting Andrea at the beginning of the show you know people look you mentioned the Nobel Prize all the people saying that Donald Trump deserves congratulations for bringing us to where we are maybe but also possible as an explanation is that North Korea has reached a degree of satisfaction or maturity in its nuclear program because of all it's done its test site is in no condition to do further testing and it may it's quite possible that simply North Korea wants a pause is willing to stop where it is for the time being see how we can benefit diplomatically see how we can benefit economically and what John Bolton's talking about that kind of intrusive verification we're upfront North Korea would have to give up everything it has in the nuclear domain my hunch is that's a non-starter so if that's the administration's position either we won't have a summit or if we do have a summit I think there's a pretty good chance that the summit would simply fail and what about the other piece of this which is certainly a lot of signals from North Korea that they want us truths out of South Korea how likely is it that the US would agree well look we have 28,500 troops there they not only provide deterrence against North Korea but they are forced for stability in the region they reassure our allies and partners including visa vie what China is doing in the South China Sea and elsewhere and so I think it'll be dangerous to take our troops off the Korean Peninsula prematurely but we we think possibly Android that the president is interested in this that he thinks that we shouldn't be defending South Korea that it cost too much even though it cost a lot more to actually house those troops in the United States and the president in some ways would like to see our troops off the peninsula that's probably what the North is gonna push him to do I think they'll be wrong Richard at the risk of taking you around the world I want to ask you about this horrible these events in Afghanistan today to suicide glasses in Kabul we're talking about 25 dead 9 journalists killed a suicide car bomber and Kandahar also killing 11 children wounding 8 NATO soldiers what do we know and how do we deal with that it's hard to be optimistic there Andrea because you now you have a government that's divided by geographically ethnically and so forth and it faces to real and distinct threats one is the familiar one the Taliban which continued to enjoy also support all sorts of support from neighboring Pakistan and now you have Isis setting up shop inside Afghanistan so I see no prospect of Afghanistan becoming a normal country any time soon I see no prospect of diplomacy working and so it seems to me we've got an open-ended problem here and whether the United and even if the United States goes ahead and increases its troop presence I don't think we'll get a return on investment that would that would make the situation better so I think Afghanistan the question is not so much what you can achieve it's what you can prevent and that's not a lot to say after more than a decade and a half of effort but I'm sorry to say that's where we are and Richard I know that you've spent some time with javad zarif the foreign minister of Iran has now been tweeting in advance of Netanyahu's speech tweeting the boy who can't stop crying wolf is at it again undeterred by cartoon fiasco at ung a younger you can only fool some of the people so many times that was his warning back in 2016 trying to block the nuclear deal at the UN well I think what's important to remember about the nuclear deal it was basically a narrow limited agreement that didn't solve the nuclear problem it basically bought time but it wasn't meant to deal with the ballistic mystic challenge it wasn't meant to deal with Iran domestically it wasn't meant to deal with Iran's regional push for for influence and access so I think one of the real questions is what do we do with this agreement at the same time how do we deal with these other challenges or threats coming from Iran the administration seems intent on commingling the nuclear challenge from Iran with everything else and my reaction would be leave the nuclear alone deal with everything else and try to get the Europeans and others degree to a follow-on agreement which would extend the curbs on Iranian centrifuges and their ability to amass enriched uranium but the administration seems more determined to have a crisis or a showdown now and I don't understand why because this does not increase the disposition of the North Koreans to sign an agreement with us if they're not persuaded that we're gonna stand by an agreement and I would have thought one nuclear crisis at a time is probably enough Jeremy bash and Richard Haass thank you both so much hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want
