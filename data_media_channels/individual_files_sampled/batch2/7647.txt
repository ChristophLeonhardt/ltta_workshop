a few weeks back a state representative in Maine decided to call one of the parkland shooting survivors Emma consulter a skinhead lesbian and thankfully he won't be a state representative for much longer because that's due to the reaction of that he's not running for re-election anymore then this week we had Laura Ingraham we were just talking about this during the break called David hog a whiner over not getting into a couple of colleges I've read his statement he wasn't even whining about it and even if he were I think he's earned a little bit of wining if he wants and in reaction to that she's lost a significant number of her advertisers including Johnson & Johnson who I believe is the largest advertiser in the country so you'd think with those examples people would back off a little bit but no members the GOP just wants them some of that action and so we're gonna turn to another one this is in North Carolina State Representative at least today Beverly Boswell had this to say about the speakers who predominantly the students at the March for our lives they're out to take your guns and our freedoms okay that's fine that's what they're all saying that's not too bad even though it's not true remotely actually many of the speakers at these rallies were calling for gun registration confiscation second amendment repeal and even the murder of those who would not turn over their guns to the government blaming guns for crime is as silly as blaming plastic bags for pollution it's typical of liberals to blame crime on everyone but the criminal first of all I would say that if you pay attention to our oceans plastic pollution it's kind of a big deal but let's stick to the guns for now they don't just want to confiscate your guns they want to get rid of the Second Amendment that was actually a former Supreme Court justice that wasn't one of the speaker's of the March for our lives and they want to murder those who won't turn in their guns that seems to me like kind of an unfair version of what they said we'll let you decide we're gonna turn to a little bit of a student Cameron kasky one of the most outspoken of the Parkland students talking about what they actually want to accomplish with our movement the NRA says that what you guys want to do is not just take away semi-automatic weapons just take away high bike capacity weapons you really want to take away people's guns well first of all we are not just marching to n school violence we are marching to end violence all over the country because that's where it happens second of all we are not trying to take everybody's guns away my father is a reserve police officer we have guns in her house they are responsibly managed and hidden from anyone but him but that the point is we are not trying to take everybody's guns away and the NRA wants people to think that their fearmongers they want to sell weapons by exploiting people's fears so the second we want to put common-sense regulations on these assault weapons the NRA will say they are trying to steal every single one of your guns and people believe them fortunately the majority of the American people see past this yeah we were just talking about how how good they are at articular their message I work at MIT so I will never be allowed on any of those networks but if I were I wouldn't be stumbling and bumbling I wouldn't be able to do like there was a there was a student who at the March vomited in the middle of her speech collected herself and then delivered a meeting other than anything I've ever done I would have the bomb apart but anyway there they explained very clearly what therefore a little bit more the mission statement for the movement says that they're working towards universal comprehensive background checks bringing the ATF into the 21st century with a digitized searchable database and advocating for funds for the CDC to research the gun violence epidemic in America which thankfully was actually a part of the recent spending bill they've also called on Congress to enact a high-capacity magazine ban and crack down on the sale of assault style weapons we did not edit out the part where they called for the murder of gun owners it wasn't there in the first place yeah that's just projection I mean let's be honest like if you want to understand like the psychological phenomenon of projection you really understand the entirety of the Republican Party right like projections where you have something going on wrong inside your head but you can't really deal with it so you just like put put it on other people and then try and like beat it out of them right and so like now they're like oh these Parkland kids who by the way they're friends at their school while they were in the school we're shot dead they're like the NRA people are like they want to kill people it's like no they're actually terrified of being killed because they were in a school where a school shooting took place they don't want to kill anyone they want to stop people from being killed but of course the Republicans and the Conservatives and the like gun worshiping nutjobs are like they want to kill people you know why because those people want to kill people they think violence is perfectly acceptable way to like solve political disputes so of course they would think like oh yeah they want to murder us why because they want to murder us they inter-are a people the Conservatives like there are the kind of people that would actually kill the politics you see none all right TV I mean God talk about a race war they're trying to talk to they're wearing this insane socialist tears smashing television showing black lives matter protests I mean they are really fomenting so much fear against black people and against leftists which I find extremely deranged and damaging especially in the climate with the Trump administration I mean it's it's really over the top I didn't totally agree with Ryan about projection but I think the reason that Donald Trump won the presidency I mean obviously there are a lot of reasons is based on fear fear fear fear of fear it's the the bottom rung of the Maslow's hierarchy of values and that's what the Republicans and what the NRA are really good at if you can get people to be fearful they will follow an autocratic leader and that's what Donald Trump is and that's why they are so strongly holding on to him but wait that's half the story right because like yes it is about fear from the Republicans and the Conservatives but it's also a complete lack of vision from the Democrats and that's where I would actually take even like the Parkland kids to tasks like being like we don't want to take your guns like no actually I do want to take your guns like if you're like if you're like a rapist or a child molester or wife beater like I want to take your gun like you don't you don't get to go they probably okay with that yeah and no that's actually not a law right well there are a couple states that have recently passed laws to take away the guns of domestic abusers exactly but that's a literal level let's do it let the NRA argue like you know oh no we want child molesters to have guns that'd be great Rob Porter I'd have a shotgun exactly there's no new ones whatsoever you hear one thing about gun control and it's let's take your guns I mean there's just insanity but follow me follow me yes I want to take your guns if you beat your wife of course and that's what absolutely and that's what I'm saying they're like we want to digitized ATF database I don't want to digitize the ATF database I don't care that's obviously part of it I don't want a bunk stock ban I don't care I think that I need a base helps you track I understand and take this is my point I was making - I'm stuck man no I don't because it's such a lack of vision it's such a poverty of vision it's not gonna solve a problem I don't want it if that is all that we would then get if we have a dream that if we would do that and then everyone would be like oh good we won then I agree I don't want that's not really where the debate is that's where the debate is it's like oh we want everybody to have we want America to be a supermarket of assault weaponry for the world and everyone in America or a bun stock ban and that is why people like Donald Trump for the Republicans Quinney we agree the Democrats aren't presenting a vision of what something would actually solve this problem you must solve this problem tax bullets at a hundred percent you wanna solve this problem make sure everybody owns a gun has to insure it if you have to pay a hundred bucks to have a gun every month you're probably gonna get rid of to buy your guns I think that yeah the Second Amendment thing obviously the NRA does not give an issue about the Second Amendment right they are selling a propaganda campaign fomented on fear to basically sell weapons that's what it comes down to the bump stock thing the assault ban stuff I mean all of these things are monumental money makers they don't know anything take it off the market the bump stock all the stuff it's going to lose massive amount of profits for them what it comes down to is making money they will do whatever they can on NRA TV whatever they can to basically foment all that the crazy hysterical Trump supporters to be gun-toting morons who think that this is about taking away guns but really we are the world's leading empire we are the world's leading arms dealers so I think it's actually a bit critical to not talk about why is it okay for Trump to be selling hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to Saudi Arabia boasting about these charts in the Oval Office meanwhile we should be blocking these arms deals we should be blocking the fact that we're the world's leading arms deal because when it comes down to it this is what creates this gun culture in America I mean it's all connected regulation under the military what are gonna do you're gonna convince the gun manufacturers to stop selling guns you gonna convince the NRA gun worshipers to stop worshipping guns you're not going to do that well I think that you would have a fight you're not gonna get guns to be taken away that's definitely not gonna yes and actually there was a national gun buyback in Australia to America I understand that I'm sure would you ask that time yeah you have music and and I agree with that but I think we have to pay attention to justice Stevens I'm a lawyer I mean he wrote the dissenting opinion in Heller was just five four his argument is really solid that the Second Amendment does not stand for what the NRA believes it stands but let's have that conversation right it's time for like gun ownership to be well-regulated again you know like it says in the Constitution well what what I would hope is that one of the I think one of the reasons we have the laws that we have is there's a fundamental disconnect between people who like guns and people who want them to be regulated where the people who want them to be regulated are far more numerous but far less passionate like the support for background checks is that higher than anything else other than like belief in angels in America or something like that but the problem is that people aren't going out and actually voting based on that issue and I'm hoping that in the same way that you've seen we talked about a poll earlier this week about how support for Medicare for all is now the majority position across the country 59% and you're seeing more and more politicians being outspoken in support of it I'm hoping that after the March for our lives this series of town halls and the fact that these kids are unlikely to go back you know they're not just gonna go on summer break and forget about this that more and more politicians will feel emboldened to be bold in the way that you want on guns and that more and more politicians on the other side will start to see that a little bit of money that they're gonna get from the NRA is not worth the votes that they'll lose if there seemed to be too easy on the NRA the midterms are super simple if you care about the gun issue if 90 plus percent who want increased background checks literally go out and register and vote for only candidates who will vote for that piece of legislation Democrats take the house and the Senate and we are primed for 2020 well I would say before me even after that so clear on that I agree with that but I would say that before we get to the general election we've got another election cycle that we're in the middle of right now and I want to make sure that the people who end up going and hopefully winning in November are the best sort of candidates we've got primaries that are taking place in a number of states still I think that people should be going and asking those people about these particular topics it doesn't have to be some sort of just general thing if they raised bills bills will pour and co-sponsor HR blank blank blank get rid of assault weapons to have more yeah yeah absolutely 70 wineries now it's all about and then the wind later on hopefully I've worked on campaigns for nearly two decades now and I can tell you the one place that politicians fear electoral opposition most is the primary because like 80 or 90% of them live in safe districts right yeah so there doesn't really matter up until now yeah they get in the general election like they're gonna win you're right but that also means a lot of them don't know how to run a real election because they've never had to right right exactly so if you go into a primary with what a lot of the people you know who have been out there and worked on elections now for Obama or Bernie or Clinton or whoever right you're going to use that knowledge and you target them in primaries you're gonna wipe the floor with them yeah right and you can get yourself elected or your friends elected or somebody will actually do something about this problem and that's what Saul's I think the problem is talking about with richer the vision problem isn't a problem of the Republicans being horrible people we know they're horrible people we know they have horrible ideas that's been obvious for decades right away right what we need is people inside the Democratic Party who have a vision who have that's our job yeah I should run too you know like we need people inside the Democratic Party who have a vision who can come up with innovative solutions that will make people want to vote because I don't even want to go vote in November for background checks it's not gonna solve the problem when we did Wolf Pack what people kept saying to us is the reason I joined Wolf Pack and started helping out with this is because I looked at the plan that Janke articulated I said that could actually work if we did that it would actually solve the problem and that's what we need on guns we need something that'll actually solve the problem you need to ensure guns you need attacks bullets you need to have licenses with photo ID for gun ownership in America at the federal level and if you tell that to people then you say this is the bill I'm gonna put forward this is the law I'm gonna present then they will vote for you because that could actually solve the problem let's let's make sure they'll like that is on the ballot for people to vote for candidates for in 2018 the reason I'm focused on this is you know the percentage of 18 to 29 year olds that traditionally voted in midterms 16 percent if we got that number up to 30 percent and if they're motivated by whatever bill background checks or the Ryan Clayton bill and let's make that then you get 30% instead of signal preserving good owners that are red that are solid red if you get all those new young people to come out and vote they're no longer red districts and we win a huge percentage of them we transform the United States of America if we go from 16 percent of young people to 30 percent of young yeah if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and
