1
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:03,726
HONESTY AND SOME COMMITMENT TO

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:05,995
MEETING THE OBLIGATION OF

3
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:06,763
DISMANTLING THIS PROGRAM.

4
00:00:06,763 --> 00:00:08,264
>> THANKS, DAVID.

5
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:10,299
LET'S GET TO RETIRED BRIGADIER

6
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:13,369
GENERAL, ANTHONY TATAU GOOD TO

7
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,237
SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

8
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:15,738
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

9
00:00:15,738 --> 00:00:17,073
WHAT ARE YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR

10
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:19,842
THE MEETING TODAY GOING INTO THE

11
00:00:19,842 --> 00:00:22,412
PLANNED SUMMIT?

12
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:24,113
>> WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS

13
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:25,748
DOING IS NEGOTIATING THE TERMS

14
00:00:25,748 --> 00:00:27,650
THAT THE UNITED STATES NEEDS TO

15
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:30,753
SEE FROM NORTH KOREA REGARDING

16
00:00:30,753 --> 00:00:31,254
DENUCLEARIZATION.

17
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:33,389
BUT ALSO LAYING A ROAD MAP OUT

18
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:35,658
FOR WHAT -- YOU REMEMBER, HE

19
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:36,993
TALKED ABOUT NORTH KOREA BEING

20
00:00:36,993 --> 00:00:39,095
ON PAR WITH SOUTH KOREA

21
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:41,497
EVENTUALLY ECONOMICALLY.

22
00:00:41,497 --> 00:00:44,901
I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY THE

23
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:46,369
QUID PRO QUO HERE.

24
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:47,203
DENUCLEARIZATION LEADS TO

25
00:00:47,203 --> 00:00:48,771
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR NORTH

26
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:50,206
KOREA.

27
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:51,708
THAT'S A FAIR DEAL, A FAIR TRADE

28
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,609
AND WHETHER IT TAKES FIVE YEARS,

29
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:55,178
TEN YEARS, WHATEVER, THEY'RE THE

30
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:55,678
SAME PEOPLE.

31
00:00:55,678 --> 00:00:59,415
I'VE BEEN OVER THERE, I'VE BE IN

32
00:00:59,415 --> 00:01:01,384
THE DNZ,'S BEEN IN SOUTH KOREA.

33
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:03,953
I KNOW THE FAMILIES ARE SPLIT

34
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:04,287
THERE.

35
00:01:04,287 --> 00:01:06,389
IT'S THE SAME WORK ETHIC, THE

36
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:07,457
SAME PEOPLE.

37
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:09,258
THERE'S NO REASON THAT NORTH

38
00:01:09,258 --> 00:01:14,097
KOREA CAN'T PROSPER

39
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:14,530
ECONOMICALLY.

40
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,433
AND MEANTIME, YOU'VE GOT THE

41
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:18,701
LOGISTICS HAPPENING THAT POINT

42
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,369
TO A MEETING SOMEWHERE.

43
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,207
I MEAN, LOGISTICS IN THE DMZ AND

44
00:01:24,207 --> 00:01:25,041
LOGISTICS IN SINGAPORE.

45
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,809
YOU HAVE PEOPLE WORKING VERY

46
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:27,110
HARD.

47
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,778
YOU KNOW, THE SUMMIT IS LARGELY

48
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:31,280
A SCRIPTED AFFAIR FOR THE MOST

49
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,581
PART.

50
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:34,550
SO YOU WANT TO HAVE EVERY DETAIL

51
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,084
IRONED OUT.

52
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:36,953
THAT'S WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS

53
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:38,821
DOING RIGHT NOW.

54
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,623
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S WORTH THE

55
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:42,525
PRESIDENT'S TIME TO FLY TO

56
00:01:42,525 --> 00:01:43,459
WHEREVER HE'S FLYING.

57
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,060
>> SURE.

58
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,895
DO YOU THINK THAT KIM JONG-UN

59
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:48,364
WOULD AGREE TO COMPLETE

60
00:01:48,364 --> 00:01:50,266
DISMANTLE, COMPLETELY

61
00:01:50,266 --> 00:01:51,367
DENUCLEARIZE BEFORE THAT MEET

62
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:52,635
SOMETHING YOU HEARD DAVID LEE

63
00:01:52,635 --> 00:01:54,504
MILLER SAYING THIS IS A LONG

64
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:56,439
PROCESS EVEN IF HE WERE TO AGREE

65
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:56,939
TO THAT?

66
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:57,940
>> I THINK HE WOULD.

67
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,776
THE TRADE OFF -- WE HAVE TO

68
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:02,378
REMEMBER IS THE BELIEF THAT KIM

69
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:05,181
JONG-UN WAS EDUCATED IN

70
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:06,249
SWITZERLAND, HE'S BEEN EXPOSED

71
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:06,783
TO THE WEST.

72
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:09,285
IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

73
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,520
NORTH KOREA, HIS GRANDFATHER AND

74
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,388
FATHER CAME IN WITH ONE VISION,

75
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:15,224
WHICH IS VERY TYPICAL OF THIS

76
00:02:15,224 --> 00:02:16,893
HERMIT KINGDOM.

77
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:19,962
THE GRANDFATHER'S VISION WAS A

78
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:20,496
SELF-RELIANT STATE.

79
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,931
KIM JONG-UN CAME IN WITH TWO

80
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:22,265
VISIONS.

81
00:02:22,265 --> 00:02:23,733
ONE BEING A NUCLEAR POWER AND

82
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,568
THE OTHER BEING A ECONOMIC

83
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:25,868
POWER.

84
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:28,538
SO HE MAY BE WILLING TO TRADE

85
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,640
OFF THE NUCLEAR POWER TO BE AN

86
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,507
ECONOMIC POWER.

87
00:02:31,507 --> 00:02:34,911
SO I THINK THIS IS PART OF HIS

88
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:39,115
PLAN TO GET TO WHERE HISTORIC

89
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:41,250
OPPORTUNITY HERE TO ACTUALLY

90
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,386
MAKE NORTH KOREA A VIABLE ENTITY

91
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:47,123
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IT IS TODAY,

92
00:02:47,123 --> 00:02:48,324
WHICH IS A BANKRUPT STATE.

93
00:02:48,324 --> 00:02:48,758
>> YEAH.

94
00:02:48,758 --> 00:02:50,259
YOU THINK THAT HAPPENS PRETTY

95
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,663
SOON INTO IT, ONCE WE KNOW THAT

96
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:55,832
THESE COUNTRIES HAVE AGREED TO

97
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:57,033
CERTAIN PRINCIPLES, YOU THINK

98
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,467
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY BEGINS?

99
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,570
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

100
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,771
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT NEEDS TO BE

101
00:03:01,771 --> 00:03:02,071
BUILT.

102
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:03,973
THAT'S THE FIRST THING.

103
00:03:03,973 --> 00:03:05,775
AIRPORTS AND PORTS AND ROADS AND

104
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:07,743
ALL OF THAT CONNECTING SMALL

105
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:11,147
TOWNS TO BIGGER CITIES AND

106
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:13,850
CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

107
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,984
NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE AND THE

108
00:03:14,984 --> 00:03:15,618
NORTH KOREAN GOVERNMENT.

109
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:17,987
YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

110
00:03:17,987 --> 00:03:21,924
CORRUPTION THERE IT'S NOT SAYING

111
00:03:21,924 --> 00:03:24,927
IT'S AN EASY ROAD TO TRAVEL.

112
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:26,195
IT'S A VIABLE ROAD.

113
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:27,830
ONE WHERE I THINK THERE'S A LOT

114
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,966
OF OPPORTUNITY INTERNATIONALLY

115
00:03:29,966 --> 00:03:32,468
TO COME IN AND HELP BUILD OUT

116
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:35,171
NORTH KOREA SO THAT THEY CAN BE

117
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,873
THIS PROSPEROUS MEMBER OF THE

118
00:03:36,873 --> 00:00:00,000
LEAGUE OF NATIONS SO TO SPEAK.
