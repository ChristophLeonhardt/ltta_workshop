I've been hearing people using LGBTQ and LGBTQIA more and more recently they use it casually in interviews or discussions pretending that saying it actually isn't really difficult or hard to remember I don't know what the right term for this movement is anymore so I started looking it up and came across an article from pink news last year they said on ironically and in all seriousness but LGBTQ Qi ap2 is a mouthful but we should just learn it already seriously they wrote we're all aware of the initialism LGBT standing for lesbian gay bisexual and transgender if we added a queue for queer that also wouldn't throw too many people after that it gets a bit trickier many wouldn't be able to name I for intersex P for pansexual or a for asexual there are also some variations which include another queue for questioning or a2 which stands for two-spirit a term widely used in Canada by non-binary indigenous North Americans confused me too but I think the part that really takes the cake is that they say if we can learn all the letters of the alphabet we can learn their weird code okay and how long will it be until they add new letters give it three more years and the LGBT movement will have an acronym longer than the alphabet and I'm not relearning this every year here's the thing that really annoys me about this we are expected to learn all of the left's new crazy words their long acronym for gay people the difference between what they call anarcho-communism democratic socialism libertarian communism the 72 different genders whatever the hell intersex is the difference between gender fluid and genderqueer and a bunch of brand new pronouns and yet despite this and despite the fact that many people bend over backwards to appease their craziness they can't even understand the difference between constitutionalists conservatives and the alt-right so ok pink news maybe people will take these crazy academic seriously when the media the far left and 90% of the LGBT community stop calling diamond and silk steven crowder and ben shapiro all right deal if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
