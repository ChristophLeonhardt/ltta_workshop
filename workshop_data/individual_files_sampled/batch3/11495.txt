revisionist world powers have a new focus for their aggression their target space they don't have to dominate it just disrupt it a very slick presentation and I discuss what appears to be a new space race with artis Nikki Aaron earlier the US has just unveiled its latest plan to fit sensors to its satellites it's not just its own satellites it's going to be doing that too it's also its allies satellites and as we know satellites key for communication navigation and intelligence that these days especially in the scenario of war and the fear or reasoning is that potential adversaries of the u.s. may be capable of hacking or even disabling these satellites so by sharing it's situational data with its allies the idea is that this will deter any potential attacks and it really is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to spending in space because in case you weren't aware space warfare is the big defense trend right now is the new black and if you don't take want to take my word for it here's the Air Force secretary I cannot think of a military action that does not depend on space Russia and China are developing capabilities to disable our satellites it seems like the big incentive for such a focus seems to be the capabilities of these potential adversaries with their own space programs of course it's China and Russia and there's this idea of a space war being promoted as something not too distinguishable from a video game see if you can spot the difference between the actual Air Force Space Command promo video and a video game the United States Air Force has owned this high ground of space for decades other nations other air forces only dream of making such a claim but what if their dream became reality never expect something you trust to turn against you millions feel the effects Thanks airports infrastructure left us open to full-scale invasion we'll compete and we'll win I'm pretty lucky like you put the the star the strapless on the screen there because I wouldn't have been able to distinguish between the video game and what is now reality by the US Air Force what's the big grand plan here well they're pouring billions into this new space technology roping in space with kids such as SpaceX is Elon Musk who can show that he can not only deliver he can do it quickly you know no need to wait around years and years for a prototype any longer and while the jamming of satellites is one concern the question now is you know when are we going to see or how long is it before we see actual physical attacks in outer space and some reports say this is already a possibility in fact speaking in February the US Air Force chief of staff said that it was just a matter of years before we're going to see American forces of fighting from space now regardless of whether this is the case or not the u.s. is definitely determined to be a leader in this field the character of warfare has changed we envision a constellation of nano satellites always the predator never the prey and in his own inimitable way the President of the United States also expressed his excitement at the militarization of space space is a war fighting domain just like the land air and sea we may even have a space force develop another one space force we have the Air Force while the space force we have the army the Navy as soon as things seem to be steaming ahead record speed here in you know people might be wondering why the no laws or resolutions to draw a line and you know how far people can take whole space was idea well actually there is almost a decade ago there were 178 countries that voted on a UN resolution to prevent a space arms race there were only two countries that abstained it was the US and Israel also Washington blocked a joint Russian Chinese effort to ban all weapons in space so perhaps an inkling they're almost a decade ago that the u.s. had designs on the militarization of space and was perhaps already as you said staking its claim to the Stars
