GOING ON AND IGNORED FOR DECADE DECADES. Jesse: SO TAKE THE CARAVAN COMING NORTH AND SEND IT SOUTH? REFRESHMENTS AND CLEAN CLOTHES. Jesse: DONNA BRAZILE, WELCOME TO "THE FIVE." I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T KNOW MY NUMBER. Jesse: SORRY. I MUST HAVE LOST IT. I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO TALK ABOUT THE IG REPORT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING IT FOR HOURS BUT WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE IMMIGRATION SITUATION. SECRETARY NIELSEN SAID THERE'S LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT ENCOURAGE THIS. THERE'S A 2008 CHILD TRAFFIC INVOLVING ABUSE. THERE IS THE FLOREZ DEAL, CLIFTON ADMINISTRATION POLICY. YOU CAN'T DETAIN MINERS FOR MORE THAN 20 DAYS. THEN YOU HAVE THE ASYLUM LAWS ABUSE. DON'T PAST ADMINISTRATIONS BEAR SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS? Donna: YES AND NO. YES IN THE SENSE THAT YOU HAVE THESE LAWS ON THE BOOKS, 1997 AND 2008 LAW. THE DIFFERENCES THIS IS A CHANGE IN POLICY, A CHANGE IN ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. EVERYONE WHO COMES NOW IS TREATED AS A CRIMINAL. AND THEY ARE SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION. WHILE THE '97 LOSS THAT YOU HAD 20 DAYS TO DEAL WITH THESE UNACCOMPANIED MINORS. THIS IS A POLICY CHANGE THAT SAYS WE ARE GOING TO SEPARATE THESE CHILDREN FROM PARENTS WHO ARE GOING TO FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. SO I THINK THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION NEEDS TO WORK WITH CONGRESS, PERHAPS THEY WILL DO IT WITH THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE THEY WILL HAVE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PUT TOGETHER A SOLUTION. FOR NOW THERE IS NO FEDERAL LAW THAT SAYS YOU MUST SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES. Jesse: YOU DON'T WANT THE CHILDREN TO BE POTENTIALLY ABUSED AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE CHILDREN ARE ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE ADULT BRINGING HIM ACROSS THE BORDER BECAUSE THE SECRETARY SAID THERE'S BEEN OVER A 300% INCREASE OF FRAUDULENT FAMILIES. CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER. Kimberly: THAT'S AN ALARMING NUMBER WHEN YOU HEAR THAT. YOU THINK ABOUT, THAT'S FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF RISKS TO CHILDREN AND BEING IN DANGER. VERY MUCH A CONCERN IN TERMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY CARES AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT FAMILIES SEPARATED FROM THE CHILDREN BUT YOU DO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DETERMINE THE TRUE IDENTITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS COMING OVER JUST BECAUSE AN ADULT IS ACCOMPANIED WITH A MINOR, YOU CAN'T MAKE THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY ARE IN FACT RELATED BECAUSE QUITE THE CONTRARY. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS OTHERWISE. THAT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE AND RECKLESS AND A MATTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND ENDANGERMENT TO CHILD SAFETY AND ENDANGERMENT TO CHIL CHILD. THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE DOES NEED TO ACT ON IT EXPEDITIOUSLY. TO DO SO AND WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE PRESIDENT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE GOOD NEWS IS THE ISSUE IS GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION AND FOCUS AND LIGHT ON IT SO THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. THIS IS A COUNTRY OF IMMIGRANTS BUT NEVERTHELESS WE'VE GOT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PEOPLE HERE AND OBSERVE THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS. Jesse: HOW DO YOU THINK THE WHITE HOUSE, DANA, I WOULDN'T CALL IT A CRISIS BUT IT'S REACHING A BOILING POINT. Dana: I THINK IT WAS SMART TO HAVE THE PRINCIPAL THERE TODAY AT THE BRIEFING. IT TOOK HER A WHILE TO GET BACK. I UNDERSTAND THEY HAD A MEETING AT 3:00 WITH THE PRESIDENT. IT'S TENSE WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE. THEY REALIZE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. I WAS APPRISED. SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T RECOGNIZE, EVEN A WEEK AGO, THAT THEY NEEDED TO GET IN FRONT OF IT. NOW YOU HAVE THESE PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME RELEASED FROM DHS, HHS, REPORTERS, CONGRESS. THE PHOTOGRAPHS DRIVE A LOT OF THINGS. YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE LITTLE BOY WAS KILLED, THE MIGRANT BOY, HE WASHED UP ON THE COAST OF TURKEY. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE CAN'T HAVE THIS. IT'S NOT THAT IT WASN'T HAPPENING TO A LOT OF CHILDREN. IT'S JUST THAT PHOTOGRAPHS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. KIRSTJEN NIELSEN WAS ASKED, WHAT ABOUT THESE PHOTOGRAPHS. SHE SAID I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM. I THINK HER STAFF CLOSER TO HER TO MAKE SURE SHE SEES THEM SO SHE'S AWARE OF WHAT EVERYBODY OUT THERE IS SEEING AND WHY THERE'S ALL THIS REACTION. A LOT OF IT IS BASED ON MISREPORTING. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY CHILDREN ARE BEING HELD IN CAGES BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTOGRAPHS, THERE ARE CHAIN-LINK PARTITIONS. THEY ARE BEING COVERED WITH SILVER MYLAR BLANKETS AND THEN YOU HEAR THE PRO-PUBLIC AUDIO SECRETLY RECORDED, MAY BE INAPPROPRIATE THAT THE AUDIO IS GOING TO PULL AT HEARTSTRINGS HEARTSTRINGS. I THINK TOMORROW WHEN THE PRESIDENT GOES TO CONGRESS COME HE'S GOING TO SAY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THESE IMMIGRATION BILLS. I WANT YOU TO PASS THEM. I HOPE IT IS SUCCESSFUL. I AM SKEPTICAL, IN A WAY, PARTLY BECAUSE I HEARD TODAY THAT ONE OF THE PEOPLE IN LEADERSHIP THINKS IT HAS A 10% CHANCE OF PASSING THE HOUSE AND THAT A BILL VERY SIMILAR RECENTLY HELD IN THE SENATE ONLY GOT 40 VOTES. SO I THINK THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REVERSE A POLICY OR FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH IT WHILE THEY TRY TO DO SOMETHING WITH CONGRESS BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE CONGRESS MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PASS ANYTHING. Jesse: GREAT COMEDY THINK THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO HANG TOUGH ON THIS ISSUE LIKE HE DOES IN THE FACE OF OUTRAGE OR DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO COME TO THE TABLE? Greg: I THINK HE LIKES SOLVING PROBLEMS AND I THINK HE WOULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF HE CAN. I DON'T THINK THE OTHER SIDE WANTS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S ONE HELL OF AN ISSUE. IT'S A HAMMER YOU CAN POUND THE WHITE HOUSE WITH. IF YOU TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR THE DEMOCRATS. I AM SO TIRED, THOUGH, PEOPLE IMPLYING THAT OUR AGENTS ARE CHILD ABUSERS. THIS IS SOMETHING WE LET FLY BY. PEOPLE ARE DOING THEIR BEST. THIS, IMAGINE SOMEBODY COMING TO YOUR HOUSE AND DROPPING OFF KIDS. YOU TRY TO DO YOUR BEST. THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS DOING. THEY ARE DEALING WITH THOUSANDS OF KIDS. YOU HAVE GENERAL MICHAEL HAYDEN COMPARING IT TO THE HOLOCAUST, CANCELLATION CAMPS, AND INSULT TO VICTIMS, SURVIVORS, PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF THESE KIDS. THAT IS IDIOTIC. HE IS A FOOL. Donna: THE STRESS, THE HARM, THE ABUSE THAT COMES WHEN YOU ARE NOT CAPABLE OF HOLDING YOUR CHILD. YOUR PULLED AWAY, YOU'RE PULLING MY PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN. A MAN COMMITTED SUICIDE BECAUSE HE DID NOT WANT TO LET GO OF HIS KID. THIS IS A CRISIS. Greg: IT'S IN EMOTIONAL FEELING. I GET IT. Donna: WHEN IT COMES TO I'M NOT AN EMOTIONAL PERSON. Greg: Donna: WHEN I KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS, SINCE YOU MENTION, THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PARTISAN ISSUE. THESE ARE CHILDREN. REGARDLESS OF WHAT MISTAKES THEIR PARENTS ARE MAKING, THEIR CARETAKER, THESE ARE CHILDREN. WE SHOULD HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN OUR HEART FOR THE CHILDREN. 29 COSPONSORS OF A BILL. Jesse: WHAT IS THE DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION? YOU HAVE A 40-YEAR-OLD MIGRANT FROM CENTRAL AMERICA. CROSSING THE SOUTHERN BORDER WITH A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL. NO DOCUMENTATION THEY ARE RELATED. WHAT IS THE BORDER PATROL SUPPOSED TO DO, ACCORDING TO A DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION? Donna: THE SOLUTION IS WE HAVE TO VET THE PEOPLE COMING HERE, WHETHER THEY ARE SEEKING ASYLUM Jesse: HOW DO YOU DO THAT? Donna: THAT'S WHAT BORDER AGENTS ARE PAID TO DO. Jesse: THIS IS PART OF THE VETTING PROCESS. YOU MAKE SURE THEY ARE RELATED. Donna: THIS IS A CHANGE IN POLICY, CHANGE AND PROSECUTING Jesse: YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO CATCH AND RELEASE? Donna: I AM SAYING IT'S A MISDEMEANOR VERSES PUTTING THEM THROUGH THIS OTHER LEGAL RIGMAROLE. Jesse: IT'S TO SAY YOU'VE BROKEN THE LAW AND CROSSED THE BORDER. YOU ARE GOING BACK HOME. NOT SHOW UP IN A MONTH TO A JUDGE IN THE 90% NEVER SHOW UP. Donna: WE ALL AGREE THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BROKEN. I'M NOT HERE TO SAY IT'S NOT. IT'S BROKEN. ALL I'M SAYING IS WE HAVE A CRISIS RIGHT NOW. DANA IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY SHOULD'VE SEEN IT COMING. JEFF SESSIONS SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING, AND CLEARLY DONALD TRUMP SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING. Jesse: THE ONE THING THAT SOLVES THE PROBLEM IS THE WALL. WHEN THERE IS A WALL, THEY CAN'T CROSS ILLEGALLY AND FAMILIES GET TO STAY TOGETHER. Greg: THE WALL UNITES PEOPLE. Kimberly: BARRIER DEFENSE. EVERY COUNTRY HAS A RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT ITS BORDERS AND MAKE SURE LAW AND ORDER IS BEING OBSERVED. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALSO HAVE TO FACTOR IN ANOTHER INTEREST HERE IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE CHILDREN ARE CARED FOR. Dana: THE OTHER THING IS
