the United States of America a unique country the most powerful nation the world has ever seen but despite being a hyper power it's unusual in one respect at least in that it has no domestic security service since the Revolution we never created an mi5 equivalent a national security branch of federal government whose job it was to spy on Americans we thought that was an American but it seems as if that has changed with the release of the FISA memo we now know that under the Obama administration Americans were spied upon by other Americans illegally for political purposes we now know that the member of the Trump campaign Carter Paige had been spied upon by the Obama administration based upon a secret warrant from the FISA Court that had been built upon the steel dossier a dossier compiled by a British former intelligence agent Christopher Steele that was made up of fictitious opposition research in part provided by Russian agents this is all unclassified you can check it out for yourself the fact that this dossier which had been paid for by the Democrat Party and by Hillary Clinton's lawyer costing more than 12 million dollars the fact that that dossier was opposition research was not revealed to the judge in that secret hearing that eventually led to a warrant being issued for an American to be spied upon that is obstruction of justice or at least perjury and abuse of power if you have exculpatory information if you have information that indicates the innocence of an individual when you are applying for a warrant against that individual you are duty-bound by American law or to tell the judge the Department of Justice at the highest levels in the FBI at the highest levels neglected to tell the judge and that is a crime but unfortunately this isn't a one-off this isn't the politicization of just a DOJ or the FBI you look at the last eight years and whether it's the Fast and Furious scandal under Eric Holder the illegal selling of guns to cartels south of the border which led to the Attorney General being the first ever AG to be held in contempt by Congress whether it's the IRS in which we now know Lois Lerner was complicit in the targeting of Americans applying for nonprofit status with their foundations and organizations simply because they had the word Patriot or tea party in the name of their organization or whether it is this latest instance we have a fact pattern we have a trend of the politicization of federal government to be used as a weapon Watergate is the largest political scandal in US history but it was a minor event in comparison it was a bungled burglary which led to a cover-up this isn't one instance that led to a cover-up it is multiple systemic exploitation of the government against you because if Carter page can be spied upon based upon false information the same thing can happen to you there are other stories just around the corner as I speak judicial watch that incredible organization here in DC check them out a tom Fitton chris farrell revealing that john kerry's state department compiled a secret dossier of information to give to democrat on the hill to use against donald trump that is not the job of the State Department which is our diplomatic corps they're not there to be used to provide political ammunition against a presidential candidate and perhaps the biggest story of all but you're still out there is the unmasking scandal when our intelligence services spy on foreigners or foreign agents if an American is rolled into that surveillance by accident their identity has to be anonymized the Obama administration on the marked the identity of Americans at a prodigious rate more than 400 percent more than prior administrations with very peculiar things such as the UN Ambassador Samantha power requesting more than 140 on maskings despite the fact that she is not part of the intelligence community that's Americans not being given their constitutional protections by the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world today so this is the beginning of a series of on Obama gate we will give you all the unclassified information so that you know what is going on and what we must never allow to happen again because if we are not a nation of the rule of law we have nothing and the events of 1776 are for naught stay tuned this is Sebastian go thanks for watching if you want to see the rest of my videos please subscribe to the rebel media YouTube channel and don't forget to follow me on twitter at said Gorka that's Seb Geor ka and if you like this video please share it on Facebook and Twitter because the fake news industrial complex has been lying for far too long and with your help we can get the truth out
