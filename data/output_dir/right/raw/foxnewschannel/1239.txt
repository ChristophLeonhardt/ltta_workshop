1
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:14,770
IT WILL BE A BEGINNING.

2
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,071
I'VE NEVER SAID IT HAPPENS IN

3
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:17,973
ONE MEETING, YOU'RE TALKING

4
00:00:17,973 --> 00:00:18,740
ABOUT YEARS OF HOSTILITY, YEARS

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,909
OF PROBLEMS.

6
00:00:20,909 --> 00:00:22,444
YEARS OF REALLY HATRED BETWEEN

7
00:00:22,444 --> 00:00:25,280
SO MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,682
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

9
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:29,251
A GOOD RESULT IN THE END.

10
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:30,185
NOT FROM ONE MEETING.

11
00:00:30,185 --> 00:00:33,822
I THINK IT WILL BE A PROCESS

12
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:34,940
THAT WE SERVE

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,257
THAT WE SERV

14
00:00:35,257 --> 00:00:35,290
THAT WE DERV

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:35,323
THAT WE DESE

16
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:35,357
THAT WE DESERV

17
00:00:35,357 --> 00:00:35,390
THAT WE DESERVE

18
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:35,424
THAT WE DESERVE T

19
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:35,490
THAT WE DESERVE TO

20
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:35,524
THAT WE DESERVE TO HA

21
00:00:35,524 --> 00:00:35,557
THAT WE DESERVE TO HAVE

22
00:00:35,557 --> 00:00:35,791
THAT WE DESERVE TO HAVE.

23
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,258
THEY WANT IT.

24
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:37,759
WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

25
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,496
AND I THINK WE WOULD BE MAKING A

26
00:00:41,496 --> 00:00:43,098
BIG MISTAKE IF KE DIDN'T HAVE

27
00:00:43,098 --> 00:00:43,365
IT.

28
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:44,366
I THINK WE'LL HAVE A

29
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:45,500
RELATIONSHIP AND IT WILL START

30
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,972
ON JUNE 12th.

31
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:51,089
>>

32
00:00:51,089 --> 00:00:51,406
>

33
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:51,673
>>.

34
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:52,874
>> Sean: JUNE THE 12th, BACK ON

35
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:53,875
IN SINGAPORE.

36
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,210
THE PRESIDENT'S REMARKS CAME

37
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,212
AFTER A TWO-HOUR MEETING IN THE

38
00:00:57,212 --> 00:00:59,448
OVAL OFFICE, WITH THE NUMBER TWO

39
00:00:59,448 --> 00:01:01,082
MOST POWERFUL MAN IN NORTH

40
00:01:01,082 --> 00:01:01,383
KOREA.

41
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,451
JOINING US NOW WITH REACTION TO

42
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:04,653
ALL OF THIS, FORMER DEPUTY

43
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:06,988
ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT

44
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:10,992
DR. SEBASTIEN GORKER, SENIOR

45
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:14,529
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER, DANIEL

46
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:14,896
HOFFMAN.

47
00:01:14,896 --> 00:01:17,732
IT'S AMAZING TO ME THAT THE

48
00:01:17,732 --> 00:01:20,101
PRESIDENT PULLS OUT SECONDS --

49
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:22,170
WITHIN 24 HOURS, OH, NO, NO, WE

50
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,105
DIDN'T MEAN WHAT WE SAID.

51
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:28,009
WE GOT A MISSILE-LAUNCHING SITE

52
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:33,882
BEING DISMANTLED, FIRST TIME IN

53
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:35,217
18 YEARS THE HIGH RANKING

54
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:36,051
OFFICIALS IN THE UNITED STATES,

55
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:38,286
WE GOT THE HOSTAGES RELEASED AND

56
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:40,188
NO MISSILES BEING FIRED OVER

57
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:42,157
JAPAN OR NO THREATS TO THE WORLD

58
00:01:42,157 --> 00:01:44,459
AT THIS MOMENT, DR. GORKA, AND

59
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,794
HE DIDN'T PAY A DIME.

60
00:01:45,794 --> 00:01:47,429
IT'S REMARKABLE.

61
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:48,129
>> YES.

62
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:51,900
LET ALONE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

63
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,435
IMAGINE IF THIS HAD HAPPENED

64
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:55,937
ANYTIME IN THE LAST 25 YEARS,

65
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:57,305
WHETHER IT WAS REPUBLICAN

66
00:01:57,305 --> 00:01:59,107
ADMINISTRATION, OR DEMOCRAT ONE,

67
00:01:59,107 --> 00:02:00,842
IF A SUMMIT HAD BEEN CANCELED,

68
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,412
THE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC PROTOCOLS

69
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:06,114
WOULD HAVE MEANT THAT IT MAYBE

70
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,182
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED A YEAR FROM

71
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:07,449
NOW.

72
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:11,520
OR 18 MONTHS FROM NOW.

73
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,287
>> Sean: GOOD POINT.

74
00:02:12,287 --> 00:02:13,421
>> THE PRESIDENT CANCELS IT.

75
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:16,491
TE HAS A VERY HARD LETTER, HE

76
00:02:16,491 --> 00:02:18,493
PLAYS HARD BALL, BUT HE LEAVES

77
00:02:18,493 --> 00:02:19,794
THE LAST PARAGRAPH OPEN SAYING

78
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:21,530
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF

79
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,163
OUR COUNTRIES.

80
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,199
IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD WITH IT,

81
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,768
SEND ME A LETTER, GIVE ME A

82
00:02:26,768 --> 00:02:27,969
CALL.

83
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:29,037
WHAT HAPPENS, WITHIN HOURS, A

84
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,740
COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, THAT

85
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,543
LETTER IS HAND DELIVERED TO THE

86
00:02:34,543 --> 00:02:35,310
OVAL OFFICE.

87
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,279
IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING

88
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:37,679
POLITICS.

89
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:39,648
IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING

90
00:02:39,648 --> 00:02:42,083
DIPLOMACY, AND IT GETS RESULTS.

91
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,585
>> Sean: I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH

92
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:44,819
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO, I

93
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,420
REALLY AM.

94
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,857
I THINK HE'S BEEN AN AMAZE

95
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:48,890
I THINK HE'S BEEN AN AMAIN

96
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:49,958
I THINK HE'S BEEN AN AMAING

97
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,926
ADDITION TO THE PRESIDENT.

98
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,028
I THINK THE PRESIDENT, DANIEL,

99
00:02:53,028 --> 00:02:55,463
YOU WERE CONCERNED GOING BACK A

100
00:02:55,463 --> 00:02:56,464
FEW WEEKS THIS YOU WANTED TO

101
00:02:56,464 --> 00:03:00,335
MAKE SURE THE PRESIDENT DIDN'T

102
00:03:00,468 --> 00:03:02,270
ALTHOUGH WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN A

103
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,805
LOT OUT OF NORTH KOREA IN A GOOD

104
00:03:03,805 --> 00:03:04,105
WAY.

105
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:05,574
AND THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY

106
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:07,509
CLEAR, THIS IS A PROCESS,

107
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:08,610
NOTHING WILL BE SIGNED ON JUNE

108
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,579
THE 12th, THAT IT MAY TAKE, IT

109
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:12,213
WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WAS ONE

110
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:13,348
MEETING, IT WOULD BE GREAT IF

111
00:03:13,348 --> 00:03:15,116
THIS HAPPENS, BUT IT MAY NOT,

112
00:03:15,116 --> 00:03:16,618
AND MAY TAKE ONE, TWO, THREE,

113
00:03:16,618 --> 00:03:18,219
FOUR MEETINGS, THEY CAN GO AS

114
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,354
FAST OR SLOW AS THEY WANT.

115
00:03:19,354 --> 00:03:19,821
>> RIGHT.

116
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:21,389
I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED AT THE

117
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:21,756
BEGINNING.

118
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:24,926
I THINK OUR CITIZENS MIGHT HAVE

119
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:25,660
EXPECTED IMMEDIATE RESULTS.

120
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,696
THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY

121
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,064
DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR US.

122
00:03:29,064 --> 00:03:30,799
BUT WHAT I WOULD REALLY

123
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,634
HIGHLIGHT IS TODAY'S MEETING,

124
00:03:32,634 --> 00:03:35,737
WHICH WAS JUST SO VALUABLE FOR

125
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:37,005
US, SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO

126
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:39,774
HAD MET TWICE WITH KIM YONG

127
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:41,576
CHOL, THE FORMER CHIEF OF

128
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:42,344
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE IN NORTH

129
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:43,778
KOREA, AND THE MAN RESPONSIBLE

130
00:03:43,778 --> 00:03:47,482
FOR THEIR NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS.

131
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:49,317
YOU'RE RIGHT --

132
00:03:49,317 --> 00:03:50,418
>> Sean: WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT

133
00:03:50,418 --> 00:03:50,785
HIM?

134
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:53,021
>> HE WAS A FOUR-STAR GENERAL, A

135
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:55,190
FORMER BODYGUARD TO KIM

136
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,157
JONG-UN'S FAMILY,

137
00:03:56,157 --> 00:03:57,692
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL TRUSTED.

138
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,694
WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO DID TODAY

139
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:02,130
WAS A WARM TURNOVER TO THE

140
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:02,497
PRESIDENT.

141
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:03,832
THESE RELATIONSHIPS MATTER.

142
00:04:03,832 --> 00:04:05,734
THIS IS WHAT WE BASE OUR

143
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:06,701
PRODUCTIVE NEGOTIATIONS ON,

144
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,503
THESE SORTS OF HIGH-LEVEL

145
00:04:08,503 --> 00:04:10,338
RELATIONSHIPS ON WHICH WE CAN

146
00:04:10,338 --> 00:04:12,140
BUILD FOR --

147
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,175
>> Sean: AS YOU'RE SPEAKING, I

148
00:04:14,175 --> 00:04:15,644
WAS WATCHING THIS LIVE TODAY, IF

149
00:04:15,644 --> 00:04:16,845
WE CAN KEEP THAT UP ON THE

150
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:18,480
SCREEN WHAT WE WERE JUST

151
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,880
SHOWING, THE PRESIDENT LITERALLY

152
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,283
WALKING HIM OUT TO HIS CAR.

153
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,152
YOU COULD READ HOW FRIENDLY THIS

154
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:24,853
ALL WAS.

155
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:26,554
YOU COULD SEE, YOU KNOW, IT WAS

156
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:28,690
SUPPOSED TO BE HANDLED WITH A

157
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,824
LETTER AND LEAVE THE PRESIDENT

158
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:31,926
SAID, BUT IT ENDED UP BEING A

159
00:04:31,926 --> 00:04:33,395
TWO-HOUR MEETING, A LOT LIKE

160
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:34,829
WHAT THE MEETINGS THAT WERE

161
00:04:34,829 --> 00:04:36,498
SCHEDULED WITH THE PRESIDENT OF

162
00:04:36,498 --> 00:04:37,932
CHINA STARTED OUT AS TEN

163
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:39,434
MINUTES, 15 MINUTES, HALF HOUR,

164
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:42,437
THEY GO ON FOR FOUR HOURS.

165
00:04:42,437 --> 00:04:42,837
>> RIGHT.

166
00:04:42,837 --> 00:04:43,672
>> Sean: CLEARLY THERE'S

167
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:44,973
SOMETHING GOING ON HERE.

168
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:47,142
>> TACTICALLY, IT MAKES SO MUCH

169
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:47,442
SENSE.

170
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:49,077
WE RELIED IN THE PAST ON

171
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,578
SIX-PARTY TALKS, RUSSIA AND

172
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:51,846
CHINA DO NOT HAVE OUR BEST

173
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:52,447
INTERESTS AT HEART.

174
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,049
WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS

175
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:56,384
THE PRESIDENT EXPERTLY MOUNTING

176
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:59,187
AN EFFECTIVE DIPLOMATIC CHARGE

177
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,089
AT NORTH KOREA, WITH SHOWING OUR

178
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,691
STRENGTH, AND AT THE SAME TIME

179
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:03,692
BEING OPEN TO NEGOTIATION.

180
00:05:03,692 --> 00:05:05,927
WE SAW IT PLAYING OUT TODAY IN

181
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:07,262
FULL FORCE.

182
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,496
>> Sean: YEAH, AS YOU WERE

183
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:10,131
WATCHING THIS UNFOLD TODAY,

184
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:11,399
DOCTOR, I'M CURIOUS, BECAUSE YOU

185
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:13,268
KNOW THIS PRESIDENT SO WELL, AND

186
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:14,369
SO MANY AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY

187
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:15,837
THOSE IN THE LEFT AND IN THE

188
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,972
MEDIA DO NOT UNDERSTAND HE IS

189
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:21,009
THE NEGOTIATOR.

190
