the u.s. actor James Woods the star off Hollywood hits like casino and also White House down has been locked out of his Twitter account for posting a hoax image the picture mocks the US Democratic Party and urges men not to vote in the country's upcoming midterm elections the social media giant claims that the actor's tweet though violates its policies and could sway public opinion but would slash tout a twitter accusing it of killing free speech free speech is free speech is not Jack Dorsey's version of free speech the erroneous Twitter accused me of affecting the political process when in fact they're banning of me is the truly egregious interference Ramar while testifying to Congress earlier this month Twitter's chief executive did praise the company's success in combating what he called opinion manipulation we've made significant progress recently on tactical solutions like identification of many forms of manipulation intending to artificially amplify information we've seen positive results from our work we're now removing over 200 percent more accounts for violating our policies not surprised at all this is pretty much what Twitter does and a lot of these other social media companies in tech Valley in California Google Facebook there are pretty much the same anything that could be considered a right-wing so-called propaganda they're gonna eliminate they were not justified in doing it was a simple meme I'm not really sure how that's considered somehow election interfering if that's going to be election interfering and people who post off light they have to get suspended and what about all the political ads I see on Twitter from candidates so that summer office it may sound good right now to have them come in and regulate Facebook Twitter and say hey you can't do platform this person you can't a deep platform that person but that won't be where they stop however prominent figures backing the Democrats on Twitter D seemingly don't face the same restrictions for example this tweet by filmmaker Michael Moore who has three times more followers than woods apparently does not amount to an attempt to sway public opinion despite refusing to admit bias in the company's decisions the Twitter chief though does say he has concerns we have a lot of conservative leaning folks in the company as well and to be honest they don't feel safe to express their opinions at the company they do feel silenced by just the general swirl of what they perceive to be the broader percentage of leanings within the company and I don't think that's fair alright just a matter of honesty and transparency in the company is not so much a matter of them doing the thing that is illegal it's about them being unethical and dishonest think about algorithms is that they are trained by human beings is not just an automated thing that has no human input whatsoever so humans may train to algorithm to look out for things that could be considered anti left-wing you see is not just a matter of it points out anything that could be considered suspicious you
