1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,830
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
HAS ALREADY PASSED ITS VERSION

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,069
OF WHAT THEY WILL CALL TAX
REFORM, BUT IN REALITY IT IS A

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,599
$1.5 TRILLION TAX CUT FOR THE
WEALTHY.

4
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,499
THEY STILL HAVE A LONG

5
00:00:14,499 --> 00:00:22,000
WAY TO GO TO PASS THIS,
OBVIOUSLY THE SENATE HAS TO PASS

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,980
ITS OWN VERSION AND THEY HAVE TO
RECONCILE THE DIFFERENCES,

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,910
HOWEVER HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW SO
FAR ABOUT THE HOUSE VERSION OF

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:50,670
THE BILL THAT AGAIN PASSED BY A
VOTE OF 227 TO 205 --

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,620
THEY ARE HOPING THIS WILL BE
SOMETHING THAT CAN COME TO A

10
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,160
VOTE IN CONGRESS BEFORE
CHRISTMAS, SO AFTER

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,810
THANKSGIVING.

12
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:06,500
SENATOR RON WYDEN,
A DEMOCRAT, HAD A GREAT QUOTE

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:16,060
THAT I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU
BEFORE WE 

14
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,229
GET INTO THE DETAILS

15
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,229
--

16
00:01:20,229 --> 00:01:23,330
AND HE IS NOT WRONG --

17
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:34,260
THE CORPORATE TAX RATE,
REMEMBER, AS IT IS IT'S NOT REALLY

18
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,650
35%.

19
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,020
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE
CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES IT'S

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,340
SOMEWHERE AROUND 17%.

21
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,840
SO FROM
WHAT I'VE SEEN THERE IS VERY

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,340
LITTLE EMPHASIS, IF ANY AT ALL,
ON DOING AWAY WITH THOSE

23
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,950
LOOPHOLES OR DEDUCTIONS, BUT
THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS

24
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,360
REGARDING LOWERING THE TAX RATES
FOR THESE CORPORATIONS.

25
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
IT ALSO

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:14,030
COLLAPSES THE NUMBER OF TAX
BRACKETS FROM SEVEN TO FOUR --

27
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,771
SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T
LIVE IN A STATE THAT HAS ESTATE

28
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:22,800
TAXES OR CERTAIN LOCAL TAXES, OR
THOSE LOCAL TAXES ARE SUPER LOW

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,250
AND YOU AREN'T WORRIED ABOUT IT,
PEOPLE LIVING IN HIGH TAX STATES

30
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,890
LIKE CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORK WILL
BE ABLE TO DEDUCT THOSE STATE

31
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,030
TAXES WHEN THEY FILE THEIR
TAXES.

32
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,209
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE

33
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:42,030
VERY FEW DEDUCTIONS THAT THE
MIDDLE CLASS GETS TO TAKE ANY

34
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,050
ADVANTAGE OF. AND THEY WANT TO
DO AWAY WITH THAT.

35
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,050
THAT IS THE

36
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,190
REASON WHY 13 REPUBLICANS
ACTUALLY VOTED AGAINST THE HOUSE

37
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,910
VERSION OF THIS BILL.

38
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,560
A BIG PART OF THE NEW YORK
DELEGATION.

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,840
LAWMAKERS IN NEW JERSEY AND
NEW YORK WERE LIKE, NO,

40
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,650
THIS WILL HURT MY CONSTITUENTS,
I'M NOT SIGNING ONTO THIS.

41
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,690
THIS WILL HAVE A HARD TIME IN
THE SENATE, POLITICAL REALITY,

42
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,650
BUT SOMETHING IS WHEN TO HAPPEN.

43
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,230
WHEREVER THE U.S. CENTERS ARE

44
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,980
RIGHT NOW THAT AREN'T TALKING
ABOUT AL FRANKEN, THEY ARE

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,510
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

46
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:18,511
THEY WANT
SOME KIND OF A DEAL, THEY WANT

47
00:03:18,511 --> 00:03:19,511
SOMETHING.

48
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,291
THEY WANT TO VOTE ON
SOMETHING BEFORE THANKSGIVING SO

49
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,260
THEY CAN GO BACK OVER THE
HOLIDAYS AND SAY WE GOT

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,170
SOMETHING.

51
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:34,650
THEY WILL GET SOMETHING IN
THERE, OUT OF THE SENATE,

52
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,849
I'M GUESSING TONIGHT OR
TOMORROW.

53
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:41,330
SOMETHING THAT COMES OUT OF IT
WILL LIKELY BE VOTED UPON IN THE

54
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,180
SENATE AND PASSED, YOU ARE
SAYING?

55
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,099
SOMETHING THEY WILL BE ABLE TO
PASS.

56
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,250
AND I WOULD IMAGINE THE

57
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,270
REST OF IT THEY WOULD COME BACK
AFTER THANKSGIVING AND YOU WILL

58
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:59,650
HAVE VOTES IN THE SENATE FOR A
WEEK STRAIGHT, JUST POWER VOTES.

59
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,319
ANOTHER THING I WANT TO MAKE
YOU AWARE OF, THEY WILL TRY TO

60
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,459
SELL THIS AS A TAX CUT FOR
EVERYONE, THE MIDDLE CLASS, YOU

61
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,430
WILL GET MAJOR TAX CUTS --
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

62
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,799
IN FACT SOME OF

63
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,680
THESE PERSONAL DEDUCTIONS PEOPLE
CAN TAKE -- LET ME REPHRASE

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,500
THIS, COMPONENTS OF THIS THAT
COULD POTENTIALLY GIVE YOU A

65
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,880
LITTLE BIT OF A TAX CUT WOULD
SUNSET IN 10 YEARS.

66
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
SO IN 10

67
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,009
YEARS YOUR TAXES WILL GO UP
ASTRONOMICALLY.

68
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,830
BUT EVEN IN THE

69
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,919
PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN, YOUR
TAXES ARE LIKELY TO GO UP AS

70
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,919
WELL.

71
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:38,210
LET ME EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU
-- AND BY THE WAY, THAT IS BASED

72
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,240
ON THE HOUSE VERSION AS IT
STANDS RIGHT NOW.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
THINGS COULD

74
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,430
CHANGE, WE DON'T KNOW HOW THEY
WILL, BUT HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW.

75
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,539
THIS IS A FOCUS ON THE SENATE'S
VERSION, WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT

76
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,539
ON YESTERDAY'S SHOW --

77
00:04:52,539 --> 00:05:04,870
THAT IS BECAUSE CERTAIN
THINGS WOULD SUNSET OR THEY

78
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,520
WOULD ESSENTIALLY EXPIRE IN 10
YEARS THAT WOULD HELP THE MIDDLE

79
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:25,210
CLASS MAYBE SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF
MONEY IN TAXES --

80
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,559
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE RIGHT
NOW.

81
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,559
AGAIN THERE'S A LOT OF

82
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:32,419
EMPHASIS ON HELPING OUT
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS,

83
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:36,819
LOWERING THE TAX RATE FOR THESE
CORPORATIONS, NOT A LOT OF

84
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,960
EMPHASIS ON HELPING THE LITTLE
GUY, BUT WHEN THEY DO THEIR

85
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,229
MARKETING THEY MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

86
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,680
THEY MARKET THIS AS A
MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT, WE

87
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,349
MENTIONED ON THE SHOW I THINK
LAST WEEK THAT THEIR VERSION OF

88
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:56,089
THE MIDDLE CLASS NOW IS $450,000
PER YEAR.

89
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,819
THAT IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE WHO
HEAR THE RHETORIC OF THIS BILL

90
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:02,930
SAY THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE
WRONG MONIKER TO USE NOW, THAT

91
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,270
THEY SHOULD CALL IT
WORKING-CLASS.

92
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,270
BECAUSE

93
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,060
MIDDLE-CLASS DOESN'T RESONATE
THE SAME WAY IT DOES, IF YOU ARE

94
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,309
OUT TO HELP THE MIDDLE CLASS YOU
ARE HELPING WEALTHIER PEOPLE

95
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,270
BECAUSE OF WHAT THE
REPUBLICAN ARE DOING.

96
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,749
SO TO CALL IT THE WORKING CLASS
MAY BE A BETTER WAY FORWARD.

97
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:19,340
THE WORKING CLASS WILL BE
ORPHANED BY THIS, AND AS ANA

98
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,809
SAYS THE CORPORATE TAX CUT IS
HUGE, AND THESE PARADISE PAPERS

99
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:27,550
THAT SHOWED THAT THESE
CORPORATIONS ARE PARKING

100
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:35,779
TREMENDOUS MOUNT OF MONEY
OFFSHORE, AND GETTING THESE TAX

101
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:38,050
BREAKS -- THOSE ARE THE
COMPANIES THAT NEED AN

102
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,339
ADDITIONAL TAX BREAK?

103
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:40,849
THE WHOLE
THING IS ABSURD.

104
00:06:40,849 --> 00:06:45,899
ALL YOU HAVE EVER DONE IS LOSE
MONEY OFFSHORE.

105
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,719
IT'S CRAZY, AND I THINK YOU
ARE RIGHT, MICHAEL, I THINK

106
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:52,809
SOMETHING WILL COME OUT OF THIS,
I THINK THEY ARE DESPERATE TO

107
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,199
MAKE A DEAL.

108
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,319
AND KEEP IN MIND, I
THINK THAT IT'S MOSTLY

109
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,190
REPUBLICANS, YES, THAT WANT TO
CUT TAXES, BUT THERE ARE

110
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,069
DEMOCRATS ON BOARD AS WELL.

111
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:05,409
AND
RIGHT NOW THE SENATE DOESN'T

112
00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:09,399
NEED MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO
PEOPLE WILLING TO SIGN ON

113
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,090
TO TAX CUTS.

114
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,740
AND PREVIEWING A REPUBLICAN
ADMINISTRATION, REPUBLICAN

115
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,120
PRESIDENT, REPUBLICAN CONGRESS,
IF THIS IS ALL THEY GET GOING

116
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,400
INTO THANKSGIVING, AND I KNOW
THIS IS SERIOUS AND THIS IS BIG,

117
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:26,409
BUT IF YOU REWIND TO BEFORE THE
SUMMER, OH MY GOD, THIS IS WHAT

118
00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:29,619
THEY WILL DO TO OBAMACARE, ON
TAXES, TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL,

119
00:07:29,619 --> 00:07:34,129
ALL THESE THINGS, AND ALL THEY
GO HOME WITH IS A BITE FROM A

120
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,611
BILL THAT CAME OUT AT THE LAST
MINUTE BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS, IT

121
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:40,419
HAS TO BE SEEN, EVEN THOUGH THE
LEGISLATION ITSELF IS TERRIBLE,

122
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,499
BUT THE POLITICAL REALITY IS
THAT IT HAS TO BE SEEN AS

123
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:47,729
SOMETHING OF A VICTORY BY THE
OPPOSITION PARTY IN CONGRESS, TO

124
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,550
ONLY HAVE THIS BE WHAT CAME OUT.

125
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,300
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE

126
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,789
BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
PEOPLE WANT, TAX CUTS FOR THE

127
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:57,789
WEALTHIEST AMERICANS IS
ABHORRENT TO SO MANY

128
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:05,869
PEOPLE, BUT THEY PLAYED PRETTY
GOOD DEFENSE, I HAVE TO SAY.

129
00:08:05,869 --> 00:08:11,779
THAT'S TRUE, FLYING UNDER THE
BANNER OF SO MUCH OF WHAT THEY

130
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,729
WANTED TO DO, THEY WILL HE
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET A LOT

131
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,729
OF THINGS DONE.

132
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,559
BUT THAT SAID,
DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN ABLE TO

133
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:21,930
GET DONE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDERS,
HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO UNWIND A

134
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,800
BUNCH OF STUFF.

135
00:08:23,800 --> 00:00:00,000
THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THOUGH
HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
