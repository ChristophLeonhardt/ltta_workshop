one person has died and more than a dozen people have been injured after a gas explosion in Austria the ensuing fire has now been put out technical problems are being blamed for the blaze eyewitnesses described flames soaring high into the sky for the area around the site of the incident is currently on lockdown the blast reportedly took place at a pumping station along a gas line parties Poli Boyka has been following the story and joins me live well hi there Poli so what more do we know well this is the Bangert and gas plant it's a gas facility in Austria it's a major hub for importing gas into Europe and it supplies a whole host of European countries including Germany France Italy Croatia and Slovenia so the repercussions of this explosion have been quite far-reaching Italy's been the worst affected there having declared to declare a state of emergency Rome now has a serious supply shortage and market prices there have more than doubled for gas but there are also repercussions elsewhere in Europe so this explosion is kind of exacerbating existing supply problems in other places for example here in the UK on top of that Austrian explosion the most important North Sea oil and gas pipeline has been shut down for a couple of weeks in order to repair a crack so that's affecting that as well and on top of that there's also a severe cold snap that's paralyzed much of the country and gas is very much in demand so prices for suppliers have increased they've searched and there are fears now that that price increase could be passed on to consumers here in the UK which would be a very bitter pill for people to swallow here at this time of year so this perfect storm of just three variables goes to show you just how vulnerable the energy supply to Europe is at times like this now the issue with the Austrian facility specifically where that explosion was is that it's the main entry point for Russian gas into Europe Russian gas accounts for about a third the overall gas supplies on the continent and there had been a new pipeline in the pipeline the Nord Stream - that was meant to create another route through which Russian gas could reach Germany and the rest of Europe but that particular project has been put on ice because of political obstacles essentially some European countries support it but others are worried about Nord Stream - they think that it will allow Moscow to wield too much power and of course sanctions against Russia also make it very difficult to anyone to invest in the project artis poly vodka in London thank you
