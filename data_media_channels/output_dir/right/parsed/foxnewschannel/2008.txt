STEVE: A WRITER FOR THE
ATLANTIC IS BLASTING
PRESIDENT
KAESIDENT
KANYIDENT
KANYE'ENT
KANYE'SNT
KANYE'SWEST'S SUPPORT FOR DONALD
TRUMP AS SHOCKINGLY
IGNORANT.
WEST CALLS HIS STRUGGLE THE
RIGHT TO BE A FREE-THINKER
AND HE IS, INDEED,
CHAMPIONING A KIND OF
FREEDOM.
A WHITE FREEDOM.
FREEDOM WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE,
FREEDOM WITHOUT CRITICISM,
FREEDOM TO BE PROUD AND
IGNORANT.
HERE TO WEIGH IN, CEO OF THE
BLACK SPHERE FOX NEWS
CONTRIBUTOR KEVIN JACKSON
JOINS US FROM PHOENIX.
KEVIN, THIS WAS QUITE AN
ARTICLE.
IT WAS LENGTHY IN VERY, VERY
LONG.
BUT HE MAKES SOME POINTS.
AND HE STARTS OUT TALKING
ABOUT HOW WHEN HE WAS
GROWING UP TO HIM MICHAEL
JACKSON WAS A GOD AND LATER
KANYE WEST WOULD BE A GOD
UNTIL THIS.
KEVIN?
>> OH, I THOUGHT YOU WERE
RUNNING A CLIP.
WELL, LOOK, SO MICHAEL
JACKSON WAS A GOD UNTIL HE
DECIDED TO LIGHTEN HIS SKIN
AND TAKE ON WHITE FEATURES.
CORRECT?
AND THE GUY WROTE THE SONG
BLACK AND WHITE.
THE GUY WROTE THE SONG MAN
IN THE MIRROR OR SANG THE
SONGS, RATHER.
AND SO MICHAEL JACKSON WAS
ESSENTIALLY SAYING LET ME
GROW UP TO BE WHAT I WANT TO
BE.
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE
MICHAEL JACKSON PIECE OF IT,
HE TALKS ABOUT HOW MICHAEL'S
FATHER RIDICULED HIS NOSE.
HE TALKED ABOUT HOW
MICHAEL'S FATHER RIDICULED
MICHAEL'S SKIN COLOR.
MICHAEL COMES BY WHATEVER
THE PATHOLOGY YOU WANT TO
THINK ABOUT IT HONESTLY.
OF THE IDEA THAT MICHAEL
JACKSON, WHO IS ONE OF THE
BEST ENTERTAINERS IN THE
WORLD, CAN'T GROW UP TO BE
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO BE.
I FIND INTERESTING.
BECAUSE HERE'S THE THING,
STEVE.
NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE
WHITE COMMUNITY CARE WHAT
EMINEM HAS BECOME.
ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC HIP
HOP ARTISTS ON THE PLANET
AND NOBODY CARES.
HOW MANY KIDS DO YOU THINK
WANT TO EMULATE LEBRON
JAMES?
HOW MANY WHITE KIDS WANTED
TO BE KOBE BRYANT OR MICHAEL
JORDAN OR THE BEST BASEBALL
PLAYER OR THE BEST WHATEVER?
YOU KNOW, WHY DID A COLOR
LIMITATION THEME ONLY FOR
BLACKS?
STEVE: HERE IS A LITTLE BIT
OF THE ARTICLE.
HE WRITES WEST'S THOUGHTS
ARE NOT ORIGINAL.
THEY ARE THE PROPAGANDA THAT
JUSTIFIES VOTER SUPPRESSION
AND FEEDS POLICE BRUTALITY
AND MINIMIZES THE MURDER OF
HEATHER HEYER.
>> AGAIN, MORE OF THE BLACK
LIVES MATTER.
COPS ARE HUNTING OUT BLACK
PEOPLE.
THE NONSENSE OF THE LEFT AND
PARTICULARLY THE LEFT IS
BLACKS WHO WANT PEOPLE TO
BELIEVE THAT IF YOU'RE BLACK
IN AMERICA, HAVE YOU NO
ABILITY TO CHANGE YOUR
CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO BE
WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE TO BE.
AND HE POINTS TO TWO PEOPLE,
MICHAEL JACKSON AND KANYE
WEST WHO HAVE EFFECTIVELY
REACHED THE PINNACLE.
WHY NOT POINT TO BARACK
OBAMA AND TELL US ALL THAT
BARACK OBAMA COULDN'T BECOME
BECAUSE THAT'S ESSENTIALLY
WHERE HE IS AT.
IF HE REALLY WANTED TO DO A
DISSECTION OF THIS
PARTICULAR SUBJECT, BARACK
OBAMA IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE
OF IT.
STEVE: REAL QUICKLY, KEVIN,
WOULD HE HAVE HAD A PROBLEM
WITH COUNCIL YEA WEST IF
KANYE WEST SUPPORT YOU HAD
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
>> OF COURSE NOT.
THAT'S WHAT THE
CONTRADICTION IS AS LONG AS
YOU SUPPORT THE POWERFUL
WHITE PERSON WHO HAS GOT THE
DEMOCRAT AFTER THEIR NAME,
YOU'RE FINE.
BUT SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP,
AND IT'S BAD.
LOOK, AT
