the Stan Collymore show today comes to Preston in Lancashire in northern England some of you may know that years ago and today I have mental health issues you'd never guess so don't show you them on camera and today I'm going to be chatting to a man that more recently as had mental health issues including trying to take his own life we want to discuss them why because it's important not just in sport but in wider society Clarke Carlisle is the man that I'm going to be talking to I hope you enjoy this fascinating interview delighted to have something out very well join me on the stand Collymore show we're here at Preston today and o'clock you played here for a little while played in the Premier League for a long time and and all the divisions in English football some people won't know that the in the last 1012 years in particular many players have come out across lots of different sports and talked about their own mental health issues I'm one of them you famously in the last four or five years have had one or two issues you've come out you've spoken with great erudition let's go back to the very beginning professional football is it a fertile ground for mental health issues any more than any other industry in your opinion in my humble and honest opinion yes and and quite emphatically yes and I believe it's because of that male orientated male-dominated arena and you'll find it similar in other such arenas like the forces you know the Armed Forces and and places work work places like that where it's very much about being the alpha male now one of the misconceptions about football I find is that people have a look at a football club so Preston say Manchester United and they think everyone's teammates you couldn't be further from the truth these guys are your teammates but first and foremost they're your first opponents there are 40 45 guys in a squad and only the 11 can go on that pitch you've got six seven eight centre halves only two one two or three can go on that pitch so each day in training I'm fighting against this guy next to me so because of that dynamic I don't want to show any signs of perceived weakness I don't want to show any physical injury I don't want to show any mental or emotional dysfunction or lack because that will give the gaffer the manager any I don't want to give him any opportunity to not pick me well it's based what you're basically saying is there are no allowances for being a human being in a football dressing room now that is in its entirety and it stems from I think we have to draw a distinction between our generation and a current generation because of the way the academies operate now it's very different to when we were apprentices or whities scholars we were very much of the school where they it was break him to make him yeah you know we were ground into the dust I remember and I was a schoolboy and apprentice under Sam Allardyce and Nigel Worthington with McCann again under Gary Megson these guys who were real disciplinarians young players were seen and not hurt and you if they said jump you know you said how high or you just jumped repeatedly until they said stop you know so it was drilled into you that you you had to show and be the best now what a lot of people don't understand is this is from 16 years of age this we've only just come out of a school system and not a time to develop and mature as an adult so all of those insecurities that you had in the playground you've actually brought them into a workplace that actually emphasizes them it focuses in on those insecurities that you had and compounds them by drawing on any negative aspect of your life or or or your work life Emily do you think if that generation would then cast aside and probably are in Liverpool Manchester London and I've had issues ever since there's a ridiculous number of people for whom football has formed their identity and then stolen that identity without giving them a livelihood or a career and and in my experience over the past ten years you know I did I did a documentary are on football suicide secret and the prevalence of of our first mental health in amongst football and footballers but what came from it the response was all about these guys who had been in an academy been a young player in as a schoolboy sold the dream from age seven eight nine right through to 1617 and then cast aside and they've been floundering ever since what is different with a young footballer and the issues that they go through in their cast aside as opposed to somebody that just cannot get a job in whatever field that they choose what's the difference in professional football that's a good question and I think that what you have to we have to focus on it is the relative expectation now when you sold a career in football yeah everybody knows football it's a global phenomenon and the riches and fortunes that can come with it can make you a superstar sets you up for life so as a 9 10 11 12 right through to 17 year old I have been set aside from my peers I've been taken out of school I've been putting the local papers I've been set on a pedestal because there's an expectation for me to achieve so when this person at 16 has that dream taken away from them they don't drop down to the level of their peers and these guys who were once looking up to them and now like oh look at you you thought you were going to be the next best thing and you actually drop off the face of the earth with well predominantly in our generation with the the side effect that you focused on football to the detriment of all else you've been taken out of schooling you know you've been ferried up and down the country so they're missing exams in this and told that you are going to be the next big thing so that you've got very little education or by qualifications let's say as a result of education and also you've got peers around you or looking on you as less than what your where before totally ostracized isolated with very very little focus or structure on what to do next would you say that where we are here that both of us have nearly lost our lives because of issues in around after football that there are many players that have gone down the road and taken their life that will never we'll have heard of yes I can say that the level of correspondence and interaction they've had from people who haven't even they've not even touched on a professional experience in football both football has destroyed their life it is absolutely it's I can't even put it into words stand because they come to me and the support channels that I'm aware of through football you know the the PFA the union that we have and the fantastic resources that they do have on offer if you choose to go and take them they're not open to these guys that you know so I'm trying to get these guys into a system that's I care there's NHS system that's for the general population but they don't have an understanding of what these guys have actually been through so the one-size-fits-all approach to anxiety depression to the various you know the spectrum of issues that that befall a man the the care the care plan doesn't fit this individual and I'll give one quick example you know when then when I was looking to to rehabilitate myself though I'm one of the five steps to well-being his exercise you know do exercise releases endorphins etc etc for an elite athlete it's the total opposite because it was that exercise and being an elite athlete and being the best of the best that was a significant stressor in my life so when I go out for a jog to release endorphins what's actually going on in my head is you can run faster than this twice the speed that you wanted to go exactly and you're like oh look at that time I tell you what if you train it is for six months you might make the Olympic team who thinks like that we do that's who thinks like that and that's that's a very high bar it is an it's an unrealistic bar in in general life but it's not to an elite athlete because you've already been at the picket the pinnacle of of your your industry you know even to make it in football the point one percent that that in itself is a success and that's just to become a first-year Pro so these guys like yourself we were at the top of the game for a decade you're in the point zero one percent of an industry Stan so how can you expect to go from being in the point zero one percent in the world into a normal lifestyle where you're just a another so for me that was very difficult 2000-2001 retired three years I said I'm going to give myself a year off ended up being three years palm loads of weight on motivation was incredibly low lots of personal issues and I was suicidal came through it reintroduced exercise into my life stayed close to friends and family which are knows something is important to you and even in the last ten years as a broadcaster pretty much every year every eighteen months have a nasty bout where after go to these this tool box exercise giving myself permission to relax and what-have-you what was your toolbox in 2001 as my first attempt to take my own life and at that moment in time there was nothing in my toolbox and there was zero support services so much so there when I had my stomach pumped at hospital are supposed to see the psychiatrist before I was discharged but the club discharged me because they wanted me in for training so he didn't want anyone else to I was in a in a mental hospital in London and I had a phone call and I was just gonna I just started two weeks previously of course of antidepressants which completely zonked me out and it was called by the physio and said I hope you're doing really well by the way we've lost two or three games Gathol wants you back and that was the I know that sounds very funny everybody but that was the attitude huh Paulie sock so roll your sleeves up get on with it yep football Tromso you know that that was the attitude and and it was never talked about since you know not in in that football club not even by the physio just I don't do that again that's it that was in 2001 coming forward to 2010 where my depression was diagnosed and I used the called doctor who prescribed me some fluoxetine hmm 20 mil add a microgram a day and and that was it that was the only thing in my toolbox so there was no understanding of how I act react respond you know what why should why should or shouldn't do at these times no understanding of why or maybe what the triggers are or precipitance or or whatever it is about my depression just the fact that you take this pill you bury why in those nine years didn't you go to look for a diagnosis if you if you felt triggers and things happening I mean I didn't until it was it was 1999 but again that was fairly light on in my career why did it take so long it took so long because I didn't know there was something to think about you know it's an unknown unknown how can you ask a question about something you don't have an understanding of so as that time progressed from 2001 to 2010 I kept having sporadic outbursts of really rational behavior and the majority of it was based around alcohol in around alcohol what I didn't understand was I was self-medicating you know I was trying to I was trying to get away from the emotional distress what I put it down is something that changes your state so whether I win a game lose a game whatever there is something in me mine because it's all very personal mine was based around a fear and a lack of self-worth so when that whenever I felt frightened or whenever I felt unvalidated or that I wasn't worth anything they would disgust in feelings in my stomach and I wanted to get away from it and what I found what was drinking yeah and and when I drank I didn't want it to stop you know it wasn't that it took my cares away it was that I gave his zero cares about my case he took over you know he went from cheesy Saturday to Saturday Sunday and one day blah blah blah and it got to a point in 2003 where I went into rehab and it was only because I was at QPR at the time and Ian Holloway fantastic man really really really good man and it was going to suck me and and then I went out he told me to come in and train with the kids kick me off the bus because I was thinking their booth told me to train me the kids but I didn't come in I just went out on the lash obviously because I've been in validating and I was scared and then I called him that next day when I was watching QPR's result come in and I thought what am i doing so I ran golly and I said look I like I've got a problem and I don't know what to do about it and they were such a magnanimous man because he said I don't know what to do but I'll find someone who does yeah so I went into a clinic but what we've got to understand is I went in there for alcohol rehab and I came out of there sober for two years which is wonderful you know it totally changed my relationship with alcohol but it didn't diagnose or address exactly you know that what I didn't know what they didn't realize at the time was the drinking was a symptom of my problem you know and and we didn't get to that so once I was sober are still in this cyclical behavior cycle of irrational behavior and it just transferred to gambling or transfer to sex or transfer to a computer game I remember playing championship manager for three four or five days on the run you know it would it stole my life but all I was doing was getting away from the present all of the things that you say can resonate with me but in terms of behaviour patterns and behaviors not having any outlet not having anybody to speak to has the professional footballers Association have individual clubs in your opinion taken mental health issues as seriously as a broken leg is mental health on the agenda yes it's on the agenda in answer to your question is it as serious as physical health no you've got to say that sport in its entirety is just a part of general society you know so it follows the curve of general society and when it comes to mental health general society their attitude their understanding it is growing in around mental health issues and social media lots of people now speak oh that's a good thing isn't it's brilliant it's brilliant people starting to look at it now how do you make advances in this area about caring and treating etc etc you know fundamentally it's academic research done we've got centuries of academic research about physical injury we haven't got that about mental health issues what compounds it is that what we do have about mental health issues with all due respect is an anglicized Caucasian Christian focus on what people should and shouldn't think like what did you start to see in the dressing room changing for the better from where you started all those years ago when I started to talk about my mental health issues I found my teammates so receptive you know there were so many of them who certain aspects of it resonated where he resonated with him so when I was talking they'd come and have a chat with me about the little part that resonated with him and they'd go and sort that out but they had plot call I'll do the dressing room that knew what he was talking about and could elaborate it in a way that was disarmed now what happens if your stand Collymore and you walk back into a dressing room having had three weeks at the Priory and the captain says where have you been that's where I add football is so disjointed and because it's disjointed the the book of responsibilities gets passed from pillar to post now what we need to do is join up what everybody is doing in this area the FA I went to one of their mental health awareness classes it was up at Newcastle and Stan it made me cry it made me cry because it was so inept it was disgusting and yes so that I was just I was distraught at what I saw our governing body trying to introduce as mental health awareness and education so I don't expect them to do that Stan that's not their job there our national governing body so they should govern they should say that every football club has to have a B and C in place some of the most powerful pieces of work that the AIA and my wife have done have been actually in illness being a front and center and saying do you know what I've had I've just come out of hospitals been really tough and I'm not 100% today but look I'm here and I'm here with my wife and I'm functioning and I'm aiming to get there in however long time and then I go go and do another piece you know six weeks later look look at me I've showered today I've actually shaved my head you know I've been done this at work and it's it's been real about what our lives are like and how we manage it and how we are successful how we operate that's what gets people on board what single piece of advice would you give to anybody that is struggling with a mental health issue in their opinion you do not have to be like myself you don't have to be like yourself you don't have to come out and broadcast it to the world you don't have to tell everyone it is imperative that you tell someone my experience is that you found someone who you trust or who you love or who is qualified just someone who feels one of those three things and just tell them what's going on the power of the negative thoughts the power of the impact of your adverse mental health issue it decreases immediately there is a weight lifted when you actually voice what's going on in your in your head all the stuff that goes on in your mind especially when you suffering from adverse bad mental health the majority of it is lies that you have no objectivity about tell someone and just get a little bit of a bounce get a little bit of a release and you will be amazed at what you then give them permission to tell you o'clock coal oil or at least we save great footballer but an even greater man I sincerely hope and there in the coming years that your mental health continues to get better and better and better but more importantly you keep giving this advice to other people that look to you that look to me to a lesser degree to just give them a nudge along the way thank you very much for joining us and God bless you Mike the World Cup is fast approaching and this week we focus on group D featuring Leo Messi and Argentina Albie celesta historically one of the top nations in world football with little messy arguably the greatest player ever to pull on a football shirt however the Argentinians struggled through South American qualification within only seven of their 18 games they sneaked through in third place Barcelona legend Messi is found it difficult to inspire his nation at a World Cup with the 30 year old scoring just five goals during his three tournament appearances so far Messi and Kyle of a tricky path to the Knockouts as they're joined by iceland croatia and nigeria iceland have become hugely popular as their fans bring color and noise with their now famous Viking thunderclap crow I should make their fifth appearance it's a World Cup Finals and with Luka Modric pulling the strings in midfield the Blazers have an excellent chance of qualification the Super Eagles of Nigeria could be the surprise package of the group as the West African nations strive for success the Nigerians have previously seen more successful times on the international stage but they appear ready for action at Russia 2018 after climbing FIFA's world rankings
