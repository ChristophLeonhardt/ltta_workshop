ROB: THE HIGH COURT UPHOLDS
DONALD TRUMP'S TRAVEL BAN AND
MITCH MCCONNELL MARKING THE
SERIOUS XM 115 HERE WITH THIS
VICTORY LAP.
>> A PICTURE IS WORTH 1000 WORDS
WHICH IS WHY MITCH MCCONNELL'S
OFFICIAL CAMPAIGN SENT THIS
PICTURE OF MCCONNELL WITH
JUSTICE GORE SUCH IN RESPONSE TO
THE SUPREME COURT RULING.
MITCH MCCONNELL BLOCKED OBAMA'S
SUPREME COURT PICK PAVING THE
WAY FOR TRUMP TO NOMINATE NEIL
GORSUCH SO THIS WAS HIS YOU'RE
WELCOME TWO ANYONE HAPPY WITH
VERMONT SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, THE
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S TRAVEL
BAN WAS NEVER ABOUT KEEPING
AMERICA SAFE.
YOU NEED ONLY LOOK AT TRUMP'S
OWN WORDS TO UNDERSTAND THIS HAS
ONLY BEEN A RACIST AND
ANTI-ISLAMIC ATTEMPT TO BAN
MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING THIS
COUNTRY.
LET'S LOOK AT WHAT LINDSEY
GRAHAM HAD TO SAY, AS I STATED
WHEN THE NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS
ISSUED IT IS NOT A RELIGIOUS

THE ORDER WAS FOCUSED ON
COUNTRIES IN TRUE STATES OF
THE UNITED STATES.
REACTION DOWN PARTY LINES.
CONSERVATIVES VERY HAPPY, THANK
YOU FOR FOLLOWING PRECEDENT AND
KEEPING OBAMA FROM STACKING THE
COURT, WELL DONE.

SENSITIVE GOVERNMENTS TO
WIKILEAKS.
A SMALL VICTORY ON SOCIAL MEDIA,

I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS NOT THE
LAST WE WILL HEAR OF CHELSEA
MANNING.
>> JERRY SEINFELD DIDN'T THINK

>> DON'T SEE -- NEVER SAW
ANYBODY END THE CAREER WITH ONE
BUGGY HORSE.
