The industry as a whole is not
as diverse as I would like it to be.
It's a work in progress.
There's so much change going on
right now.
It's uncomfortable and it can be scary
but I think that's healthy.
We had everybody in our casting
and it was like mind blowing
but it was so cool it's like OK,
this feels like today.
I'm always attracted to people who
have great personalities.
You know something is alive
behind their eyes,
and you know they've got
something to express.
We want the models to actually speak
and tell something about themselves
or their truths or their goals,
their dreams,
people that inspire them,
so we really want to hear from them.
We're seeing so much variety now.
I think there's beauty in everyone.
