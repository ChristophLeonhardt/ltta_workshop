A group of gang members armed
with machetes and knives.
A teenager hunted down
and dragged from a
New York City bodega.
Then swarmed
by attackers outside.
The vicious murder
in June of
Lesandro Guzman-Feliz
just blocks from
his Bronx home
drew outrage from across
the city and beyond.
The incident revealed the
barbaric tactics of a gang
called the Trinitarios and
it laid bare a glaring paradox:
Amid historically low
crime rates in New York,
police are still struggling
to contain brutal violence
in some neighborhoods.
The footage went viral
and with rumor and
speculation about why
the 15-year-old boy known
as Junior was singled out.
We obtained footage from
multiple security cameras
and cell phones.
We talked to police sources,
family members and
other witnesses.
Our investigation
retraces Jrunior’s last steps
and uncovers new details that may
answer why he was targeted.
It’s Wednesday, June 20th.
Junior is on summer
break from school.
He’s at home with
his mother.
At 10:05 p.m., security footage
shows Junior leaving home
to meet his friend Jason
Velez at this corner.
They hang out on a stoop close
by, chatting and listening
to hip-hop, according to Jason.
At around 11:30, Junior leaves,
and two minutes later
security cameras
catch him on this corner
passing near his home.
He was walking toward
Adams Place, a small street
about five minutes away
that’s known for
gang activity.
Friends and family told us
that Junior wasn’t in a gang
and the police have no
such indication either.
But some of his friends were,
and he had been
hanging out with them
at Adams Place recently.
On his way there,
Junior was in touch
with this friend,
who lives on Adams place and who,
according to our reporting,
is not in a gang either.
The friend says he told
Junior not to come over
because it was late.
At 11:35, a security camera films
four cars driving slowly
past the stoop where Junior’s
friend and some others
were sitting.
The friend says they felt
things were getting dicey
and went inside.
The cars briefly stop
at this intersection,
and then turn left in the
direction of Junior’s path.
According to police, the drivers
spot Junior and taunt him.
Junior begins to run
and the cars give chase.
The cars then split up
and appear to surround him.
It’s 11:37.
Junior rushes into this bodega
just one block from his home.
In a panic, he tries to hide
behind the counter.
But it’s too late.
One man, identified
by prosecutors
as Jose Tavarez, enters the
bodega and spots Junior.
He’s been charged
with these crimes.
He leaves and immediately
three other men enter.
Police have identified them
as: Danel Fernandez,
Kevin Alvarez,
and Michael Sosa Reyes, who has not
been charged
in relation to Junior’s killing.
Parked outside the bodega are
the cars that chased Junior.
At least eight other
men are on the lookout.
Some armed with
knives.
A warning: These next scenes
are hard to watch,
and we’ve obscured
some graphic parts.
Junior and the bodega
owner appear
to have an exchange
with Kevin Alvarez
before Junior was grabbed
and beaten on the ground.
Then he’s dragged
from the bodega
and brutally stabbed by
a swarm of attackers.
According to prosecutors,
Jose Munoz first hacks
Junior with a machete.
Then, Elvin Garcia,
who police say
is seen here wearing a mask.
Manuel Rivera is accused
of repeatedly stabbing Junior.
Antonio Santiago is seen here
from this other angle.
Prosecutors say that
Jonaiki Martinez
gave the fatal stab,
slashing Junior’s neck.
Five other people have
been arrested and accused
of involvement in the crime.
All of the men charged
have pleaded not guilty.
It’s 11:39.
Junior stumbles back into
the bodega,
leaving a trail of blood on the floor.
But the owner appears
to direct him away.
Junior gestures for
someone to call 911.
Then he starts running to St.
Barnabas Hospital, just one
block away.
He makes it to the
entrance of the hospital
before collapsing.
Passersby try to help.
Witnesses say these
two police officers
stood by watching the scene.
They are under investigation
for failing to help.
Just 20 minutes
later, Junior is
pronounced dead as a result of
a stab wound to the neck.
How Junior was killed
follows a pattern
of attacks by
Trinitarios, a
Dominican gang that
was born in New York
prisons.
In recent months,
turf wars have spiked among
rival Trinitario factions.
At least 10 other people
have been maimed this summer
in tit-for-tat
attacks in the Bronx.
Just two days before Junior
was killed, a 14-year-old
was seriously injured
in this attack.
And on the night
before Junior’s murder,
he had witnessed another
stabbing at Adams Place.
Junior’s friend,
a Trinitario, had
been attacked by a rival
faction and allegedly
turned to Junior for help.
Is that why Junior
was targeted?
We don’t know.
But a leading police theory
is the attackers mistakenly
believed Junior was
in a rival gang.
What we do know is that for
Junior — like many teenagers
growing up in gang-afflicted areas —
there’s a fine line between
hanging out on the streets
and getting caught up
in deadly violence.
