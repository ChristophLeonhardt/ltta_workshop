well the second person who was on that video and his restaurants the ground there by security and then escorted out is 79 year old CIA veteran Ray McGovern he served at the agency for 27 years but then became a political activist - protesting the use of torture programs McGovern is a staunch critic of Gina Haspel we contacted his lawyer who told us the activists spent a night in jail well the CIA's enhanced interrogation program was the main focus of agency head nominee Gina hospital's Senate grilling as she's been accused of being directly involved in torture practices in the past and though Haspel promised that under her leadership the agency wouldn't restart the controversial program there there certainly was some ducking and diving at the hearing you believe the program in terms of the interrogation program was consistent with American values we have decided to hold ourselves to a stricter moral standard are they consistent with American values senator I believe very strongly in American values I want to trust that you have the moral compass that you said you have I have conducted myself honorably and in accordance with US law do you believe that the previous interrogation techniques were immoral what I believe sitting here today is that I support the higher moral standard we have decided to hold ourselves to answer the question senator I think I've answered the question if not torture and morality were the main topics of discussion at today's hearing there was some very clear opposition to Haskell but those who were skeptical were concerned about her prior involvement with the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques which many describe as a torture program for some background on the controversy hostel reportedly ran a CIA prison in Thailand where these techniques were used and she's accused of destroying tapes that documented these interrogations human rights organizations have even called upon the public to reach out to their representatives and oppose her nomination but president Trump seems to have no qualms with her questionable history in fact he's even praised her for being quote tough on terror so it's unclear whether or not Trump's support will be enough for an easy confirmation but we'll just have to see what happens jeanna Haspel has had practically every senior position in the CIA's headquarters she's currently the acting director of the CIA I knew her when she was the chief of staff in the counterterrorism center she's been in the senior intelligence service for decades but I think that she's not qualified to lead the CIA because the actions that she took during the dark period of the CIA's torture program disqualify her she has been doing literally everything she can think to do other than telling the truth about the CIA's torture program to get this job Gina Haspel had the opportunity to say the right thing that this was a dark period in US history people made mistakes the program was immoral it was illegal it was unconstitutional she never said any of that well the most recent polls do suggest that only 1/3 of Americans believe that the alleged involvement in torture does render Haspel unfit for the post of CIA chief we ask people on the street what they think immoral immoral it's pretty cruel and so wrong I don't think it's morally morally right so was going to stop a terrorist attack and to be all right I don't like them but I don't claim to understand why it's done or how it's done sometimes switch it might be necessary if it kept Americans you know here safe from terrorism or information leading to any any terroristic activities of course
