- How much does it cost to feed
a family of three per month?
(men answer)
Remember this the home of three,
apartment for three people.
Certain things just need a
little TLC, am I correct?
-  Yep.
-  That's generally what happens
when you become a father.
Everything changes.
-  You grow up...
- Everything changes, right?
-  You can't do bad stuff no more.
- Absolutely, because
you want to stick around
for your legacy, which is your child.

This is the South Side of Chicago.
When people think about Chicago,
the first thing they speak
about is the violence, right?
Oftentimes you really
don't hear those stories
about some of the great
things that are going on
on the South Side.
Courage, integrity.
I learned that from my
mother, my grandmother,
but I still was a knucklehead,
running with the wrong crowd.
I wound up going to
jail for armed robbery.
I disappointed a lot of
people who believed in me
and who had invested in me.

Really understanding the
consequences behind what I did,
it changed me.
It made me look at the world differently.
Working hard, right?
Give me three things that you
need to change in your life
and just be honest with yourself.
I built the Dovetail Project,
a fatherhood initiative
for young African-American men
between the ages of 17 to 24.
I grew up with my father
in and out of my life.
That played a real big
impact on me in my growth.
Before you can talk about fatherhood,
you have to talk about manhood
and how you view yourself
and value yourself
because the way that you view yourself,
that's how your children view you.
90% of the young men that
we serve have grown up
with their fathers in
and out of their lives,
but they're looking to
do something different.
We've been able to impact
over 287 young men,
giving them scholarships to go to school,
partnering them with employers,
talking about those areas.
We have 287 success stories, right?
Because all of them have come out
to just be that great father
and heroes to their children.
When I became a father for the first time,
to me it was really a magical moment.
I had a chance to see life.
I'll never forget it.
I don't think we live in a bad world.
There are a lot of great
people doing wonderful things.
My goal is to make sure that
she's one of those people.
Stories like that aren't
told all the time.
