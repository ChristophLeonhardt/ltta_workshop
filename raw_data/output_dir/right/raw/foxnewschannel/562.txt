1
00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:01,608
ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:01,608 --> 00:00:03,143
BRIAN?

3
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:03,510
ANNA?

4
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,411
BRIAN: STEVE A NEW STUDY

5
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:06,246
FINDS THE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL

6
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:06,880
IMMIGRANTS LIVING IN THE

7
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,482
U.S. IS ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN

8
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:09,549
WE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT BY A

9
00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:09,816
LOT.

10
00:00:09,816 --> 00:00:12,386
THE STUDY FOUND THAT

11
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:12,919
22.1 MILLION ILLEGAL

12
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:13,920
IMMIGRANTS WERE LIVING IN

13
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,522
OUR COUNTRY OVER DOUBLE THE

14
00:00:15,522 --> 00:00:18,058
PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED

15
00:00:18,058 --> 00:00:18,525
11 MILLION.

16
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:19,159
ANNA: HERE TO EXPLAIN HOW

17
00:00:19,159 --> 00:00:20,060
THEY CAME UP WITH THE NEW

18
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,728
NUMBER ARE THE AUTHORS OF

19
00:00:21,728 --> 00:00:23,664
THAT STUDY PROFESSOR OF

20
00:00:23,664 --> 00:00:24,498
OPERATIONS RESEARCH PUBLIC

21
00:00:24,498 --> 00:00:26,767
HEALTH AND ENGINEERING AT

22
00:00:26,767 --> 00:00:32,339
YALE UNIVERSITY AND JONATHAN

23
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:32,706
FEINSTEIN.

24
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:33,641
GOOD MORNING AND THANKS FOR

25
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:34,108
BEING WITH US.

26
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:35,542
>> GOOD MORNING, ANNA, HOW

27
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:35,909
ARE YOU?

28
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:37,878
>> THANK YOU FOR INVITING

29
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:38,212
US.

30
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:38,679
ANNA: I'M FINE.

31
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,513
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

32
00:00:39,513 --> 00:00:40,447
JONATHAN, I WILL START WITH

33
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:40,714
YOU.

34
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:42,683
HOW HAVE WE BEEN WRONG FOR

35
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:43,817
SO LONG AND HOW DID YOU

36
00:00:43,817 --> 00:00:45,219
FIGURE OUT A NEW WAY TO

37
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,086
STUDY THESE NUMBERS?

38
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:48,656
>> YES, THE NUMBERS WE HAVE

39
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:49,890
ABOUT 11 MILLION, ARE BASED

40
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,191
ON SURVEY APPROACHES IN

41
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:52,526
WHICH THEY GO OUT INTO THE

42
00:00:52,526 --> 00:00:54,028
COMMUNITY AND ASK

43
00:00:54,028 --> 00:00:55,195
INDIVIDUALS TO EXPLAIN ABOUT

44
00:00:55,195 --> 00:00:56,664
THEIR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN.

45
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:57,831
WE LOOKED AT THOSE

46
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:59,099
APPROACHES AND WE SAW THAT

47
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:00,267
THEY POTENTIALLY WERE NOT

48
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:01,402
GOING TO BE VALID.

49
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:02,536
IT'S DIFFICULT TO GET

50
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:04,171
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

51
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,471
UNDOCUMENTED TO RESPOND TO A

52
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:08,475
SURVEY LIKE THAT.

53
00:01:08,475 --> 00:01:09,677
IT'S HARD TO LOCATE THEM.

54
00:01:09,677 --> 00:01:10,844
THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A REASON

55
00:01:10,844 --> 00:01:12,146
NOT TO BE LOCATED.

56
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:13,380
THEY MAY NOT ANSWER

57
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,315
TRUTHFULLY ON THE SURVEY.

58
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:15,516
WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD

59
00:01:15,516 --> 00:01:18,252
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A

60
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:19,720
DIFFERENT APPROACH AND SEE

61
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,654
USING A DIFFERENT APPROACH

62
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:22,022
WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS WE GOOD

63
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:23,958
AND IT TURNS OUT WE GOT VERY

64
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,625
DIFFERENT NUMBERS.

65
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:25,926
>>

66
00:01:25,926 --> 00:01:26,527
BRIAN: DID YOU LOOK AT

67
00:01:26,527 --> 00:01:27,962
BORDER CROSSINGS?

68
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,896
OVERSTAYED VISAS?

69
00:01:28,896 --> 00:01:30,364
WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT?

70
00:01:30,364 --> 00:01:32,133
>> SIMPLE LOGIC IS WE JUST

71
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,100
LOOK AT EVERYONE WHO IS

72
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,536
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY AND

73
00:01:35,536 --> 00:01:36,237
SUBTRACT EVERYONE WHO IS

74
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:36,570
LEAVING.

75
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,571
SO COMING INTO THE COUNTRY

76
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,706
YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT.

77
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:40,574
WE ARE LOOKING AT BORDER

78
00:01:40,574 --> 00:01:40,941
CROSSINGS.

79
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:41,976
WE ARE LOOKING AT PEOPLE WHO

80
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,577
ARE OVERSTAYING THEIR VISAS,

81
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:45,413
THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN WAYS

82
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:46,680
THAT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS

83
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,047
COME IN.

84
00:01:47,047 --> 00:01:48,949
AND THEN LEAVING THE COUNTRY

85
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:50,184
PEOPLE, OF COURSE, WHO ARE

86
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:52,720
DETAINED AND THEN DEPORTED

87
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,388
ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF THIS.

88
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:57,958
ALSO PEOPLE LEAVE

89
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,160
VOLUNTARILY.

90
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,628
PEOPLE DIE AND SOME PEOPLE

91
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:01,595
GAIN LEGAL STATUS.

92
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:02,897
AGAIN, THE ESSENCE OF OUR

93
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:05,099
APPROACH IS TO SAY WHAT WAS

94
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,001
THE INITIAL POPULATION IN

95
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:07,501
ABOUT 1990.

96
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,402
WEE THINK IT WAS ABOUT

97
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:10,003
3.5 MILLION.

98
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:10,937
YOU ADD EVERYONE WHO COMES.

99
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:12,840
IN YOU SUBTRACT EVERYONE WHO

100
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,543
GOES OUT IT DOES NOT INVOLVE

101
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:17,678
ASKING ANYBODY ANY

102
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:18,045
QUESTIONS.

103
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:19,647
IT'S BASE WORKING WITH

104
00:02:19,647 --> 00:02:20,515
OPERATIONAL DATA.

105
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:21,249
ANNA: SO, IF YOUR NUMBERS

106
00:02:21,249 --> 00:02:21,816
ARE CORRECT.

107
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:22,817
IT SOUNDS LIKE WE PROBABLY

108
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:23,918
NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY WE

109
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:25,386
ARE DEALING WITH OUR PROBLEM

110
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:26,821
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION.

111
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:27,688
JONATHAN, HOW CONFIDENT ARE

112
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:28,856
YOU IN THESE NUMBERS?

113
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,591
DO WE NEED TO DO MORE

114
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:31,693
RESEARCH IN A SIMILAR FACE?

115
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,763
>> WELL, WE CERTAINLY DO I

116
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:36,698
WANT TO ADD AS WELL THIS IS

117
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,232
A PRODUCT OF AMERICAN

118
00:02:38,232 --> 00:02:39,300
HISTORY, THE MODERN HISTORY

119
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,202
STARTS IN ABOUT 1990.

120
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,904
AND FROM THAT TIME TO NOW,

121
00:02:42,904 --> 00:02:44,572
THERE WAS A VERY LARGE

122
00:02:44,572 --> 00:02:45,974
INCREASE, WE BELIEVE IN THE

123
00:02:45,974 --> 00:02:48,643
NUMBER OF UNDOCUMENTED

124
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:51,379
INDIVIDUALS FROM 1990 INTO

125
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,513
THE MIDDLE 2,000S.

126
00:02:52,513 --> 00:02:54,082
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE SINCE

127
00:02:54,082 --> 00:02:55,416
2008 THE NUMBER HAS ACTUALLY

128
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:56,017
BEEN QUITE STABLE.

129
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:57,252
WE HAVE A MUCH BETTER

130
00:02:57,252 --> 00:02:58,653
CONTROL OVER OUR BORDERS

131
00:02:58,653 --> 00:03:01,189
THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY.

132
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:01,623
BRIAN: RIGHT.

133
00:03:01,623 --> 00:03:03,124
BUT THE NUMBER KEEPS GOING

134
00:03:03,124 --> 00:03:03,725
UP, CORRECT, ED?

135
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,326
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S BEEN QUITE

136
00:03:05,326 --> 00:03:06,995
STABLE OVER THE PAST 10

137
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:07,295
YEARS.

138
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:08,396
>> RIGHT, YOU ACTUALLY,

139
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,297
JONATHAN IS RIGHT.

140
00:03:09,297 --> 00:03:10,365
THE NUMBER DOESN'T KEEP

141
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:10,899
GOING UP.

142
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,001
THE NUMBER HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

143
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:17,138
FLAT SINCE ABOUT 2008 THE

144
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:20,041
QUESTION IS WHERE HAS THAT

145
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,045
NUMBER BEEN FOREIGN

146
00:03:24,045 --> 00:03:25,313
EMPHASIZE WE ARE NOT SAYING

147
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:26,648
THAT THE POPULATION OF

148
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:28,817
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAS

149
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:29,818
FACTUALLY DOUBLED WHAT WE'RE

150
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,853
SAYING IT WAS HIGHER ALL

151
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,121
ALONG AND UNDER ESTIMATED

152
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:34,022
FOR ALL OF THESE YEARS.

153
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:36,257
WE BELIEVE IT WAS

154
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,058
UNDERESTIMATED BECAUSE OF

155
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:37,692
THIS SURVEY APPROACH.

156
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,027
>> I WOULD ALSO ADD THERE IS

157
00:03:39,027 --> 00:03:41,096
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY.

158
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,063
BRIAN: YOU ARE TELLING ME WE

159
00:03:42,063 --> 00:03:43,865
ALWAYS HAD 22 MILLION

160
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,500
ILLEGALS, THEY KEEP DYING OR

161
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,504
LEAVINGOR GET NATURALIZED?

162
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:51,406
>> NOT ALWAYS BUT FOR THE

163
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,008
PAST 10 YEARS THE NUMBER HAS

164
00:03:53,008 --> 00:03:53,575
BEEN STABLE.

165
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:54,710
22 MILLION IS AN AVERAGE

166
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,479
OVER MANY, MANY DIFFERENT

167
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,847
REPLICATIONS OF OUR BASIC

168
00:03:58,847 --> 00:03:59,147
MODEL.

169
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,749
THE NUMBER I WOULD SAY WE'RE

170
00:04:00,749 --> 00:04:02,851
MORE CONFIDENT IN IS A

171
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,920
CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF

172
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,054
16.7 MILLION, WHICH IS 50%

173
00:04:06,054 --> 00:04:07,456
HIGHER THAN WHAT WAS

174
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,156
PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED.

175
00:04:08,156 --> 00:04:10,826
WE'RE QUITE CONFIDENT THAT

176
00:04:10,826 --> 00:04:12,060
THERE ARE AT LEAST THAT

177
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,394
NUMBER.

178
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:13,929
THERE EASILY COULD BE AS

179
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:14,563
MANY AS 22 MILLION.

180
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:15,631
IN FACT, THE YOU WERE ENDS

181
00:04:15,631 --> 00:00:00,000
OF OUR SIMULATIONS AS FAR AS
