- I'm a computer information science major, what can people getting into computers do to help the conservative movement? - Tweet, you should tweet. (audience laughing) I'm actually, I am a Russian bot. So I don't know if you're a Russian bot, too. But we could tweet, that would be a great idea. It's very difficult the place that you're in. Very often I get questions from people in show business who say, should I tell people in show business that I'm conservative, to which I say, probably not if you want to work. Google showed us that that's probably the same in tech. My friends who are in tech largely are left wing, those are not hospitable places. Jack Dorsey, for all intents and purposes, has admitted that he has a leftist culture. Google fired James Delmore. One question you'll have to ask yourself, as you get along in your career is should you be open and public and publicize your views, or should you lay a little bit lower. I can't answer that. You probably know the answer to that better than I do, but I've been very open with my views, it's probably cost me professionally in certain areas, but I don't really mind it. But if you want to actually work in that field, you might have to play a longer game. Be wise as a serpent and innocent as a dove. Unfortunately, today we have a lot of people who are as innocent as serpents and wise as doves, but you should do the opposite. And I wish you luck. And if you do make your way in there, please stop censoring my show. Stop it, man, get them to let my show air, all right? (audience clapping)
