THE BOARD.

50
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:51,560
IN GENERAL THEY REALLY DON'T

51
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:57,132
KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO BECAUSE THE

52
00:01:57,133 --> 00:01:57,833
PRESIDENT IS DOING SO WELL.

53
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:58,534
AINSLEY: WHAT DID YOU THINK

00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,268
ABOUT THE WOMEN'S MARCH WRITING

55
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,140
FILLED IN KAVANAUGH'S NAME, BUT

56
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,476
IN THE SUBJECT, IT SAID IN

57
00:02:07,477 --> 00:02:08,877
RESPONSE TO DONALD TRUMP'S

58
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:10,912
NOMINATION OF XX, FORGOT TO FILL

59
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:12,147
IN HIS NAME TO THE SUPREME COURT

60
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,349
THE WOMEN'S MARCH RELEASED

61
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,184
FOLLOWING STATEMENT.

62
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,418
TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY IS

63
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,719
DEATH SENTENCE FOR THOUSANDS OF

64
00:02:23,593 --> 00:02:25,327
>> OTHER ES DID THAT.

65
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,895
ONE GROUP PUT OUT A RELEASE

66
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,235
OPPOSES ROE V. WADE.

67
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,604
THERE WAS A FIND AND REPLACE

68
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,274
TELLS YOU THEY'RE NOT REALLY

69
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,876
THINKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS.

70
00:02:40,877 --> 00:02:42,611
HERE IS WHAT THEY'RE MISSING.

71
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,414
THEY'RE NOT EVEN MAKING AN

72
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,782
EFFORT TO DISCUSS THESE ISSUES

73
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:52,321
WITH HIM, TO MOVE IN THERE, THEY

74
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,256
DEMOCRAT SENATORS.

75
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,526
WE HAVE NO INTERESTS, KAMALA

76
00:02:57,527 --> 00:02:58,193
HARRIS.

77
00:02:58,194 --> 00:02:58,861
HE IS PERSUADABLE.

78
00:02:58,862 --> 00:03:00,362
THAT IS ONE OF MY BIGGEST

79
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:01,763
CONCERNS ABOUT HIM, HE CAN BE

80
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,231
MOVED.

81
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:03,632
DEMOCRATS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO DO

82
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:05,467
THAT I CONTEND BECAUSE THEY WANT

83
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:06,969
THIS INSTEAD.

84
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,337
THEY WANT THE DIVISION.

85
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,339
AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST, MAYBE

86
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:14,943
FEEL AS THOUGH WE ARE.

87
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,578
BRIAN: I GET THE SENSE THE

88
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,146
NUMBER OF INDEPENDENTS IN THIS

89
00:03:20,984 --> 00:03:23,151
GETTING DISTATEFUL ON BOTH

90
00:03:23,152 --> 00:03:25,487
PARTIES AND CATACLYSMIC THEORIES

91
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:26,121
AND STATEMENTS.

92
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,589
BOTH KNOW THEY'RE FOOLHARDY.

93
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,658
I SENSE TOO, TAMMY, THIS IS THE

94
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,433
SENATORS IN RED STATES.

95
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:39,768
>> HE HAS NO REAL LEVERAGE

96
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:40,769
BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALREADY

97
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:00,889
OBSTRUCTING.

98
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,657
THEN WHAT DO THEY EXPECT IF THEY

99
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:03,292
ARE YOU GOING TO GET AMY BARRETT

100
00:04:03,293 --> 00:04:03,992
WHO WOULD BE EXCELLENT JURIST?

101
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,526
WHAT DO THEY EXPECT?

102
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:05,193
THEY NEED TO ENGAGE, THIS IS

103
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:05,827
PART OF A PROCESS WORKING

104
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,194
TOGETHER.

105
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:06,695
FOR THE MIDTERMS.

106
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:07,496
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO PRESIDENT

107
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,931
TRUMP'S THIRD TERM AND CYBER

108
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:14,336
PRESIDENT TRUMP IN 50 YEARS.

109
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:22,644
THEIR OBSTRUCTION.

110
00:04:22,645 --> 00:04:23,879
IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH

111
00:04:23,880 --> 00:00:00,000
IF THEY WORK TOGETHER WITH HIM.
