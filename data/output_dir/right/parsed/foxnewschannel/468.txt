>> THE HE TIRE NATION HAS
WITNESSED THE SHAMELESS CONDUCT
OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY.
THEY ARE WILLING TO THROW AWAY
EVERY STANDARD OF DECENCY,
JUSTICE, FAIRNESS AND DUE
PROCESS TO GET THEIR WAY.
THEY DON'T CARE HOW THEY GET IT.
YOU SEE IT HAPPENING BEFORE YOUR
EYES.
I THINK IT'S' AN INCREDIBLE
THING THAT'S HAPPENING.
I HOPE YOU DON'T SIT HOME
BECAUSE BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN
IF YOU SIT HOME.
JUDGE JEANINE: PRESIDENT TRUMP
DOUBLES DOWN ON THE DEMOCRATS IN
TONIGHT'S RALLY IN WEST
VIRGINIA.
ONE OF THOSE REPUBLICANS RUNNING
IS HOUSE INTEL CHAIRMAN DEVIN
NUNES WHO IS BACK WITH ME IN
PART TWO OF THIS "JUSTICE"
EXCLUSIVE.
CHAIRMAN NUNES YOU WERE THE
TOPIC OF A LOT OF HEADLINES AND
DISCUSSION ON TELEVISION AS IT
RELATED TO THE MEMO AND
INVESTIGATION OF THE FISA
WARRANT.
THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WAS GOING
TO DECLASSIFY THE INFORMATION
RELATING TO THAT.
AND I MUST TELL YOU PERSONALLY
EVERYONE I SPOKE TO ACROSS THE
COUNTRY WANTS THIS DECLASSIFIED.
DECLASSIFY IT, NO REDACTION.
HE SAID I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO
THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> I'M GUESSING MANY PEOPLE WHO
DON'T WANT THIS OUT WENT TO THE
WHITE HOUSE AND HAD A SHEETING
AND TOLD THE PRESIDENT A LOT OF
THINGS THAT WEREN'T TRUE LIKE
OUR ALLIES DON'T WANT THIS OUT
WHICH IS A RIDICULOUS TAPE.
HOW WOULD THE ALLIES EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S IN A FISA WARRANT.
I THINK THE PRESIDENT GOT
SPOOKED ON THIS.
HE'LL TURN IT OVER TO HAVE THE I
AM G. LOOK AT IT.
-- WE WORKED SO HARD TO GET
THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE WANT FULL TRANSPARENCY.
WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS THIS
GETS TO THE UNDERSTAND POLICY
THAT REMEMBER STRZOK AND PAGE
WERE TALKING ABOUT?
WE BELIEVE THIS WAS THE
UNDERSTAND POLICY.
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAYING IT
WASN'T THE DOSSIER IT WASN'T THE
DOSSIER THAT WAS USED.
AND IT WASN'T THE FAKE NEWS
STORY.
IT'S ALL THAT STUFF BEHIND THE
REDACTION.
WHAT'S BEHIND THOSE REDACTIONS
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DO NEED TO
KNOW ABOUT.
JUDGE JEANINE: THEY ARE WORRIED
ABOUT SOURCES AND METHODS AND
NATIONAL SECURITY.
IS THIS CONNECTED TO ROD
ROSENSTEIN?
HE'S FIRED OR HE'S NOT FIRED.
THERE IS A MEETING, THERE IS NOT
A MEETING.
IS THIS ROSENSTEIN APPLYING
LEVERAGE?
IT SEEMS HE'S THE ONE WHO IS
GOING TO FALL.
>> I DON'T KNOW YES WAS INVOLVED
IN THIS PROCESS.
HE SHOULD NOT BE ADVISING THE
PRESIDENT ON THIS.
EVERYBODY IN CONGRESS, THE
SPEAKER, THE LEADER, THE WHIP,
THE WHOLE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE, NEARLY EVERY
REPUBLICAN CALLED FOR THESE
DOCUMENTS TO BE DECLASSIFIED.
JEAN WHERE THE PRESIDENT --
JUDGE JEANINE: THE PRESIDENT
CHANGED HIS MIND.
>> IF ROSENSTEIN WAS INVOLVED IN
THAT PROCESS, IT SHOULD BE A
DISMISS AFTER THAT MEETING.
WHENEVER WE MOVE TO GET THINGS
DECLASSIFIED THEY SAY WE ARE
GOING TO RUIN NATIONAL SECURITY.
WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME?
THE STUFF COMES OUT AND IT MAKES
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE
FBI AND GPS AND THEY ALL LOOK
BAD.
JUDGE JEANINE: THERE IS NOTHING
THAT -- I COULD HAVE IMPANELED A
GRAND JURY WITHOUT INSPECTOR
GENERAL GIVING ME A 500-PAGE
REPORT.
WHAT IS THE I.G. DOING?
>> THE I.G. IS FINE.
GREAT.
THE I.G. IS GOING TO LOOK AT IT.
WE ARE A SEPARATE BRANCH OF
GOVERNMENT.
WE CREATED THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE.
WE HAVER RIGHT TO SEE THAT
INFORMATION.
WE HAVE DECIDED THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THE
INFORMATION.
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE TO SEE THE INFORMATION.
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THIS CAN BE
HELD UP?
I THINK ALL THEY ARE TRYING TO
DO IS STALL UNTIL AFTER THE
MID-TERMS.
BUT WE ARE RIGHT AT THE END.
WE HAVE 20 PAGES OF THE CONTENT,
WHICH IS THE INSURANCE POLICY.
WE HAVE THE BRUCE OHR 302s.
THIS IS BRUCE OHR'S WIFE WAS
WORKING FOR THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN
AS THIS WAS BEING FURNLED INTO
THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THE TRUMP
CAMPAIGN.
SO WHY WOULD WE STILL BE HERE
NEARLY A MONTH AWAY FROM THE
ELECTIONS AND WE STILL CAN'T GET
TRANSPARENCY OUT TO THE AMERICAN
OH
PEOPLE?
-- SO THE PRESIDENT HAS TO DO
SOMETHING.
