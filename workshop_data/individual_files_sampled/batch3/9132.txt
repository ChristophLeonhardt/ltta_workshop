NEVER ENTERED U.S. AIRSPACE BUT CAME WITHIN 55 MILES. PETE: PETE, PETE: EDTE, PETE: ED,E, PETE: ED, I LIKE WHAT YOU DID WITH STAIRWAY WALK. CHALLENGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BE WATERBOARDED. WATCH. THIS REMEMBER HOW THE GENTLEMAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE TALKED ABOUT TORTURE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TRY IT I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN TORTURED, WHO ARE SAYING THIS IS NOT A GOOD THING, YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN TORTURED. AND NEITHER HAS DICK CHENEY. PETE: THAT WAS WHOOPI. BRING IN THE AUTHOR OF ENHANCED INTERROGATION DR. JAMES MITCHELL HELPED DEVELOP THE CIA'S INTEAR CONGRATULATION PROGRAM AND INTERROGATED KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMED. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHOOPI'S COMMENTS AND HOW THEY REFLECT THE MEDIA'S VIEW OF WHAT YOU HAD TO DO TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE? WELL, HONESTLY WHO THINKS WHAT WHOOPI GOLDBERG THINKS. I'M TEMPTED TO COMPLETELY DISMISS IT. ON SECOND THOUGHT, MAYBE SHE COULD SHOW US HOW IT'S DONE. THE NEXT TIME THERE IS CREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE OF ANOTHER CATASTROPHIC ATTACK WITH THE POTENTIAL TO KILL THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES, MAYBE SHE COULD GO TO UNSAFE PLACE IN THE WORLD AND INTERROGATE THE TERRORISTS AND I WILL STAY BACK HOME. I WILL STAY SAFE WITH MY FAMILY AND CRITICIZE HER LIKE SHE CRITICIZED US. I THINK WHAT SHE IS DOING REALLY IS VALUE SIGNALING. PREENING IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE THAT LIKES HER TO SHOW HOW MUCH MORE MORALLY SUPERIOR SHE IS TO US. I WOULD SAY AS A PSYCHOLOGIST THAT SHE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL THE REASON FOR THAT IS A STRONG WILLED MAN LIKE DONALD TRUMP, IF HE IS EXPOSED TO THE WATER BOARD, HE IS NOT GOING TO THINK LIKE WHOOPI GOLDBERG SEES. HE MAY SEE HIS HARSHNESS AND THINK THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED. WE MAY NEED TO BE DOING MORE OF THAT REMEMBER, WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT WATERBOARDING WAS LEGAL, I WATERBOARDED AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES. HE GOT UP OFF THE WATERBOARD AND DECIDED THAT NOT ONLY WAS IT LEGAL. NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT TORTURE. BUT IT DIDN'T VIOLATE OUR TREATIES WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. SO, I THINK SHE JUST NEEDS TO BE CAUTIOUS. PETE: WHEN YOU WATER BOARED THAT ASSISTANT A.G. THE IDEA WAS YOU WANT THIS TO SEE WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE. HE OR SHE STOOD UP AND SAID IT BROUGHT ME TO THE PRECIPICE, I PROBABLY WOULD ULTIMATELY I'M SAFE AND JUST FINE AFTERWARDS. ACTUALLY, IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND. HE DEMANDED THAT WE WATERBOARDED HIM SO HE COULD DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS TORTURE. AND THEN IN THE RUN UP TO DOING THAT I WATERBOARDED A CIA ATTORNEY, A WOMAN, WHO WOULD NOT ALLOW US TO WATERBOARD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL UNTIL SHE WAS WATERBOARDED. AND BOTH OF THEM SAID ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THING. IT SUCKED. I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO IT AGAIN. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S TORTURE. NOW, THE LAWS HAVE CHANGED. AND THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK YOUR VIEWERS PROBABLY SHOULD BE AWARE OF. THIS IS A TEMPEST AND A TEAPOT. THE LAWS HAVE CHANGED. THE MORAL LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED. WATERBOARDING IS OFF THE TABLE NOW. SO, FUSSING AND GETTING HYSTERICAL ABOUT WATERBOARDING IS AN IRRELEVANT WASTE OF TIME. IT'S SIMPLY VALUE SIGNALING. DR. MITCHELL COULD THERE BE A WORLD AGAIN WHERE WATERBOARDING ISN'T OFF THE TABLE? HAVE WE FORGOTTEN WHAT OUR ENEMY ALSO DO TO US? I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARY RIGHT NOW, GIVEN OUR CURRENT THREAT SITUATION AND THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR ORGANIZATION. BUT FUTURE BAD GUYS EVER GET A NUCLEAR WEAPON, CAN YOU BET YOUR AS IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE TABLE AGAIN. NO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS GOING TO ALLOW A TERRORIST TO SET OFF A NUCLEAR BOMB IN NEW YORK CITY OR LOS ANGELES OR CHICAGO OR SEATTLE OR PORTLAND BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN THE MORAL HIGH GROUND. IF THEY DO, THEY OUGHT TO BE RAN OUT OF TOWN ON A RAIL BECAUSE THAT'S JUST DESPICABLE. PETE: DR. JAMES MITCHELL,
