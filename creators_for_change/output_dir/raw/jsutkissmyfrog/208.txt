00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reviewing an</font>

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,019
exclusive love and memoir by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Johanna</font>

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,899
adores and I hope I'm saying that right

4
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,150
I gave that<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud look like I felt like</font>

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,590
I was saying it right so I feel like

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's fine this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nonfiction memoir</font>

7
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,820
that's written by a dragon about her

8
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,970
grandparents who were and captives

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,369
during the Holocaust is entirely made up

10
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:22,590
of research and embellished fiction so

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,029
there aren't actually any words from the

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,439
people who went through this in it which

13
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,289
i think is a very interesting

14
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">speculative kind of place a place we're</font>

15
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">not exactly in the territory of the boy</font>

16
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,239
in the striped<font color="#CCCCCC"> pajamas where things are</font>

17
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,700
very fictional or goodnight<font color="#E5E5E5"> mister</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom</font>

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,680
also not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the realms of primary source</font>

19
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,160
firsthand survivor experiences and stuff

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,660
like that which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have read and they're</font>

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,100
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting but this is</font>

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,020
somewhere in between and that's kind of

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,399
why was very interested to read it I

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,980
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wars last year</font>

25
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,360
and I read anything from mouse to like

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,640
the Night Watch by Sarah waters and I

27
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,809
was reading a lot of stuff about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the war</font>

28
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,850
then and I also read a really mention

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,430
interesting one called fragments by

30
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,640
Benjamin will<font color="#CCCCCC"> Comiskey very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly it</font>

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,180
is a memoir that this guy wrote the one

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,799
lot of prizes because he is like

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,049
fragmented memories of him and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

34
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">holic in the whole of course camp and</font>

35
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,590
that it it kind of turned out that he

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,860
wasn't actually there um but he still

37
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,150
thinks he was there but there is a

38
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:25,799
considerable of evidence to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that he</font>

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely wasn't there he was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

40
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,659
in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of care system at the time</font>

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually was so interested I went</font>

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,799
away and read a<font color="#E5E5E5"> book called the wilk</font>

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">mirsky affair why Stefan McClure I think</font>

44
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,880
that's how he say it quite a thick book

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,290
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually read the whole fingers I</font>

46
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,700
was so interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> like listening to all</font>

47
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,920
the experiences of other people and then

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,299
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the evidence of like how he</font>

49
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,520
could be mental but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe he</font>

50
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,990
actually is right maybe he was there and

51
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was some kind of mix-up with the</font>

52
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,590
two boys getting swapped and like it's a

53
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,180
really interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> field for me is what</font>

54
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,159
I'm trying to say so I I understand that

55
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,509
my pool to this book might not be

56
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:59,219
everybody's personal Paul's wit as a

57
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,689
side note I'd like to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

58
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,549
like the cover it's not actually a font

59
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:04,290
it's actually it looks like somebody's

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,969
written out on with a marker I think

61
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,369
that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of symbolic way to</font>

62
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,110
represent what this kind of memoir is

63
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,030
because it's a very kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of formal font</font>

64
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,380
but it's also and

65
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,580
and something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of marked on</font>

66
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,290
by somebody out what really<font color="#E5E5E5"> drew me to</font>

67
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,140
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> its difference to a lot of pain</font>

68
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,050
literature kind of covers but like small

69
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,380
children going like this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPR I think</font>

70
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,940
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> suffice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that that has</font>

71
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,560
been done it's a really tasteful great

72
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,700
cover for something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

73
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,230
represents what it is which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

74
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,960
unusual approach at a memoir Tibet

75
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,310
really I was really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on this</font>

76
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,740
book and I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best way Tori but</font>

77
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,020
it is to kind of read you the blurb<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

78
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">I spent the morning in October it's fine</font>

sifting through the fragments of family

this glamorous an enigmatic couple the

granddaughter imagines their final day I

94
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:11,910
meant the family stories and portraits

95
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,440
by friends she dares to give voice

96
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,030
they're never mentioned experiences in

97
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,200
the Holocaust and their escape from

98
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,540
hungry during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the uprising of 1956</font>

99
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,490
there's two styles to this book and the

100
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,830
first style is basically her tracing

101
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,540
lots of different information about her

102
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,190
grandparents think she starts off in

103
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,870
Budapest where they met as not see Power

104
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,690
kind of rises this fan is taken to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

105
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,390
concentration camp while<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vera hides with</font>

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,340
their young son we're gonna wake you

107
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,450
know won't give away all the spoilers

108
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,000
spoilers but yet they do find it there

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,130
again and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then loads of other stuff</font>

110
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,780
happens they get they kind of join the

111
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,940
Hungarian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Communist Party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while</font>

112
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could have moved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all these</font>

113
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy places and it's very</font>

114
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interesting the other chapters are</font>

115

Johanna and imagining the last day that

116
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,650
her grandparents had together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

117
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,030
conversations that happen before they

118
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,520
did commit suicide<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the thoughts that</font>

119
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,480
might have been going through their head

120
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,580
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like that's very</font>

121
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal it's something that she kind of</font>

122
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,060
has like social permission to do because

123
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,270
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> was actually related to them but not</font>

124
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,459
everybody could do that for this this

125
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-life couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> majan their last day</font>

126
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,209
together and write about it it's really

127
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,320
really tasteful<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really really</font>

128
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,910
interesting but what is best about this

129
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this book took the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> row crowd</font>

130
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,870
but what's best about it is it it's

131
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,570
it's very very unsentimental in some

132
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,010
ways which is crazy because it's such an

133
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,840
extreme story and it's such an extreme

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,500
and context that and you know she's

135
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,449
related to them but somehow she managed

136
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have this stances like one step back</font>

137
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,290
like this is how they were this is how

138
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,630
they weren't Vera was sometimes rude

139
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,330
blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah and and like that they're</font>

140
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,280
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> heroes in this book they are just</font>

141
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,810
people again like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was saying with the</font>

142
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,760
road it completely d glamorizes it while

143
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,830
also giving it giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story a lot of</font>

144
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,389
honor and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of reverence and by not</font>

145
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:00,340
making them heroes it's quite upsetting

146
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,660
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the way she presents it</font>

147
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,460
isn't some way that's good like trying

148
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,590
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make you upset</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is like this is</font>

149
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,900
an emotion mongering the writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> style</font>

150
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,610
is sometimes a little bit jarring it is

151
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,620
a translated text<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that has</font>

152
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,050
something to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that obviously um but I</font>

153
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,370
wouldn't say literary wise it was

154
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,530
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but as a memoir which is warning</font>

155
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,710
is and its really freaking interesting

156
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,600
and the way she's if you're interested

157
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,340
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> memoirs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway or you're interested</font>

158
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">in like biographies and stuff the way</font>

159
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,270
she's done is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite unique just from</font>

160
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,000
existing it kind of does discuss what is

161
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,280
fiction and what is nonfiction and where

162
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,229
does the memoir sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that one by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

163
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:40,419
person who the memoir is about isn't

164
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:42,160
around I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say honestly</font>

165
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,510
there were a few parts that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> slightly</font>

166
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,450
sluggish but I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just about</font>

167
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,700
Saved by the format which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very like</font>

168
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,310
chapter this chapter<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I researched</font>

169
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,330
this and I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and torture this</font>

170
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,520
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they said this and then</font>

171
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,510
here's a little bit of fiction about

172
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,800
what might have happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

173
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,080
afternoon and then here's me going to

174
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">hungry and looking around this</font>

175
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,039
concentration camp and then here is them

176
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,380
in their living room bro so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

177
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,870
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it's very cleverly done and I</font>

178
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,310
would definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend it to people</font>

179
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,810
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in that kind of thing</font>

180
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,720
and RHS aware memoirs like I am but just

181
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,789
kind of stumbled upon this because I was

182
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:18,250
shelving it at waterstones I've never

183
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,470
heard of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you know did agree i'd</font>

184
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,120
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i read a bit around that</font>

185
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,130
topic around the time and so yeah I

186
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,690
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that should be</font>

187
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,070
brought into the discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> more when</font>

188
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,710
talking about Holocaust<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiction and</font>

189
00:06:29,710 --> 00:00:00,000
nonfiction
