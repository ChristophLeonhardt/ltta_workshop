HE WENT THROUGH A SYSTEM AND WE GOT HIM OUT. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM OUT FOR A LONG TIME. ] THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. THERE WAS NO DEAL MADE AT ALL. THERE WAS NO DEAL. BUT, WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE HIM AND HAVE HIM IN GOOD SHAPE. I HEAR HE IS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE. Sean: THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER TONIGHT TALKING ABOUT THE RELEASE OF AMERICAN PASTOR ANDREW BRUNSON. JOINING US NOW ON THE PHONE FROM THE AMERICAN CENTER FOR LAW AND JUSTICE, ALSO THE PRESIDENT'S ATTORNEY AND ALSO AT TIMES HE HAS BEEN MINE. JAY SEKULOW YOU HAVE WORKED ON THIS CASE, JAY, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, I KNOW HOW HARD YOU WORK. I KNOW HOW HARD THE PRESIDENT HAS WORKED ON THIS. THIS IS GREAT NEWS TONIGHT. NO, THIS IS A BIG WIN. WHEN YOU DID THE INTRODUCTION I FEEL LIKE I'M REPRESENTING EVERYBODY TONIGHT. WHAT A GREAT DAY IT IS FOR THE BRUNSON FAMILY AND FOR PASTOR BRUNSON HIMSELF AND THE PRESIDENT AND ADMINISTRATION DID A FEBRUARY NOMINAL JOB MOVING THIS CASE FORWARD. I HAVE HANDLED A LOT OF THESE. THE FACT IS THEY ARE DIFFICULT. THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THERE IS PROGRESS AND THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THEY ARE NOT. THIS WAS EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT WAS A NATO ALLY. THE END RU89 OF IT POSITIVE ASPECT OF THIS, IS THAT THE PASTOR HAS BEEN RELEASED UNCONDITIONALLY AND IS ENROUTE MAY HAVE ALREADY LANDED IN GERMANY AND COME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES AS EARLY AS TOMORROW. GREAT WIN AND HUGE THANK YOU TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE PRESIDENT AND TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AS WELLING. THE PRESIDENT REALLY LED THE CHARGE HERE TO GET THIS DONE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. Sean: THERE WAS NO DEAL. AND THE CHARGE FOR PASTOR BRUNSON WAS HE WAS PREACHING THE GOSPEL, RIGHT? YES. I MEAN, ACTUALLY THE INDICTMENT ITSELF HAS THE WORD IN TURKISH, OF COURSE, IT'S CALLED CHRISTIANIZATION. THAT IS THEY VIEW THAT ACT OF RUNNING A SMALL CHURCH, SHARING THE GOSPEL AS AN ACT THAT WAS AN ACT OF TERRORISM. THAT'S HOW THEY DEFINE IT THIS WAS A TERRORISM CASE, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. BUT, AGAIN, THE GREAT NEWS IS HE HAS BEEN RELEASED. HE HAS BEEN RETURNED. I APPRECIATE YOU COVERING IT AND, AGAIN, APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT THE PRESIDENT DID IN GETTING THIS ACCOMPLISHED FOR THE FAMILY.
