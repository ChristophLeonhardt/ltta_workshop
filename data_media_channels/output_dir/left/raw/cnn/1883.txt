tonight that the people said right at

17
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:08,350
the beginning you know there's something
special happening here and we went to

18
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:16,030
center stage almost from day one in the
debates we loved those debates but we

19
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,630
went to center stage and we never left
right it's all of us we did it together

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:59,210
fighting for our agenda and we will not
stop until the job is done

24
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:06,360
this evening joined together with
friends we reaffirm our shared customs

25
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,260
traditions and values we love our
country we celebrate our troops we

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:21,780
embrace our freedom we respect our flag
we are proud of our history we cherish

27
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:49,200
our Constitution including by the way
the Second Amendment

28
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:57,849
we fully protect religious liberty we
believe in law and order and we support

29
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:03,030
the incredible men and women of law
enforcement

30
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:18,540
and we pledge our allegiance to one
nation under God you always understood

31
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:27,220
what Washington DC did not our movement
is a movement built on love it's love

32
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,050
for fellow citizens it's love for
struggling Americans who've been left

33
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:38,620
behind and love for every American child
who deserves a chance to have all of

34
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:47,650
their dreams come true from the inner
cities to the rural outposts from the

35
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,479
Sun Belt to the Rust Belt from east to
west and north to south our movement is

36
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,880
built on the conviction that every
American from every background is

37
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,889
entitled to a government that puts their
needs first

38
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:16,220
it is finally time to rebuild our
country to take care of our people and

39
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,720
to fight for the jobs our great American
workers deserve and that's what we're

40
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:43,400
doing

41
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,710
after our amazing election victory The
Forgotten men and women remember we used

42
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,360
to talk about the Forgotten men and
women before the election guess what

43
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,949
they're not forgotten
anywhere anymore now they're not

44
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:07,880
forgotten anymore folks in fact they're
trying to figure you out they're saying

45
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,889
the obstructionists how do we get them
to vote for us I don't think that's

46
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:21,720
going to happen anytime soon we believe
that every American has the right to

47
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,639
live with dignity respect for America
demands respect for all of its people

48
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,979
loyalty to our nation requires loyalty
to each other

49
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:40,650
we all share the same home the same
dreams and the same hopes for a better

50
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:50,870
future a wound inflicted upon one member
of our community is a wound inflicted

51
00:06:50,870 --> 00:07:05,179
upon us all you saw last night you saw
last night did anybody watch last night

52
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:16,080
when one part of America hurts we all
heard and when one American suffers an

53
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,219
injustice all of America suffers
together we're all together it's time

54
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:29,610
for us to follow the example of our
brave American soldiers and I was with a

55
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:38,310
lot of them last night
Fort Myers no matter where they come

56
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:46,500
from no matter what faith they practice
they form a single unbreakable team

57
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,310
that's what we are we're team as a
nation were tear they're all united by

58
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,310
their devotion to our country and to
their mission it's time for all of us to

59
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:06,120
remember that we are all in the same
team we are all Americans and we all

60
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,000
believe right now in America first

61
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:24,720
and it's happening and it's happening
fast I see all those red hats and white

62
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:32,099
hats it's all happening very fast it's
called make America great again you see

63
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:42,779
what's going on it's coming back very
fast we want every child to succeed

64
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:49,920
every community to prosper and every
struggling American to have a chance for

65
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,320
a better life what happened in
Charlottesville strikes at the core of

66
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,529
America and tonight this entire arena
stands United in forceful condemnation

67
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:16,620
of the thugs who perpetrate hatred and
violence

68
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,579
but the very dishonest media those
people right up there with all the

69
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:24,089
camels

70
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:27,250
so the and I mean truly dishonest people
in the media and the fake media they

71
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,200
make up stories they have no sources in
many cases they say a source says there

72
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:38,770
is no such thing but they don't report
the facts just like they don't want to

73
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:45,300
report that I spoke out forcefully
against hatred bigotry and violence and

74
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:56,580
strongly condemned the neo-nazis the
white supremacist and the KKK I openly

75
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,120
called for unity healing and love and
they know it because they were all there

76
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,960
so what I did

77
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:15,040
so what I did as I thought I take just a
second and I'm really doing this more

78
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,820
than anything else because you know
where my heart is okay I'm really doing

79
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:29,770
this to show you how damn dishonest
these people are

80
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:36,240
so here is my first statement when I
heard about Charlotte's ville and I have

81
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,610
a home in Charlotte so a lot of people
don't know here's the first can't

82
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,320
believe they haven't figured that one
out yet now they know now they finally

83
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,590
know but I just I don't want to bore you
with this but it shows you how dishonest

84
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,460
they are and most of you know this
anyway so here's what I said

85
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:01,560
really fast here's what I said on
Saturday we're closely following the

86
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,770
terrible events unfolding in
Charlottesville Virginia this is me

87
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:10,410
speaking we condemn in the strongest
possible terms this egregious display of

88
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:17,130
hatred bigotry and violence that's me
speaking on Saturday right after the

89
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,430
event

90
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,180
so I'm condemning the strongest possible
terms

91
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:26,450
egregious display hatred bigotry and
violence okay I think he can't do much

92
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,320
better right okay but they didn't want
to put this on they had it on initially

93
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:37,060
but then when they talked he didn't say
it fast enough he didn't do it on time

94
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:44,290
why did it take a day he must be a
racist it took a game

95
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:56,190
dishonest people
so here's here is me I hope they're

96
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,110
showing how many people are in this room
but they won't they don't even do that

97
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:06,240
the only time they show the Krauts is
when there's a disrupter or an anarchist

98
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,260
in the room
I call him Atticus because believe me we

99
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,670
have plenty of anarchists they don't
want to talk about the anarchists so

100
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:19,950
this is me it has no place in America
I'm talking about hatred bigotry and

101
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:27,090
violence it has no place in America
what is vital now is a swift restoration

102
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:32,790
of law and order and the protection of
innocent lives no citizen should ever

103
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,380
fear for their safety security in our
society and no child should ever be

104
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,780
afraid to go outside and play or be with
their parents and have a good time this

105
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,440
is me speaking

106
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:59,550
here's further this is on Saturday the
first one I did there's three times we

107
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,880
have to come together as Americans with
love for the nation and true affection

108
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,770
really and I say this so strongly true
affection for each other

109
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:15,960
I didn't say drew a fraction for you and
you I said for each other all of us all

110
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:25,290
of us all of us but they don't report it
they don't they just let it go above all

111
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:32,340
else we must remember this truth no
matter our color creed religion or

112
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:39,090
political party we are all Americans
first we love our country we love our

113
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:58,399
God we love our flag

114
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:09,850
then I went on this is my first segment
and they said remember they said well he

115
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,970
wasn't specific enough why was it any
more specific so in my second statement

116
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:22,389
I got really specific and they said why
didn't he do it faster he I'm telling

117
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:26,980
you folks look look I know these people
probably better than anybody and a lot

118
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,209
of people have a problem with it because
look what happens with them if they're

119
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:34,959
doing a story about me I know if it's
honest or false if you're reading a

120
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,870
story about somebody you don't know you
assume it's honest because it's like the

121
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,870
failing New York Times which is like so
bad it's up

122
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,540
or the Washington Post which I call a
lobbying tool for Amazon okay that's a

123
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,190
lobbying to offer Amazon or CNN which is
so bad and so pathetic and their ratings

124
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,880
are going down

125
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,760
right

126
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:27,940
but all the net where I mean CNN is
really bad but ABC this morning I don't

127
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,110
watch it much but I'm watching in the
morning and they have little George

128
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:40,870
Stephanopoulos talking to nikki Haley
right little joy and and he talks about

129
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,780
the speech I made last night which
Believe It or Not got great reviews

130
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:50,980
right they had a hard time they were
having a hard time because it was with

131
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,920
soldiers we were somber we were truthful
we were doing we were saying things and

132
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:02,020
it really did so he talked about it for
like that much then he goes let's get

133
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:08,709
back to Charlottesville Charlottesville
and Nicky was great she's doing a great

134
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:14,650
job by the way so now I say we have to
heal our wounds and the wounds of our

135
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:21,160
country I love the people of our country
the people all of the people it says I

136
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,380
love all of the people of our country I
didn't say I love you because you're

137
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:34,420
black or I love you cuz you're white or
I love you because you're from Japan or

138
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:41,770
you're from China or you're from Kenya
or you're from Scotland or Sweden I love

139
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,630
all the people of our country

140
00:17:50,990 --> 00:18:01,100
so I said his mouth might this is by the
way folks this is my exact words I love

141
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,929
all the people of our country we're
going to make America great again but

142
00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:11,570
we're going to make it great for all of
the people of the United States of

143
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:25,600
America and then they say is he a racist
is he erases then I did a second one

144
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:36,970
so then I did a second one don't bother
it's only a single voice and not a very

145
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:58,620
powerful voice

146
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:04,650
how did he get in here supposed to be
with a few people outside how about how

147
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:09,150
about all week they're talking about the
massive crowds that are going to be

148
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:18,150
outside where are they well it's hot out
it is hot I think it's too warm you know

149
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:23,220
they show up in the helmets and the
black masks and they've got clubs and

150
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,230
they've got everything and defy

151
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:37,180
so on August the 14th so that was it and
I said all people I love all people

152
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:43,180
everything right now I figure I'm gonna
do it again I'll be even more specific

153
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,050
so I said based on the events that took
place over the last weekend in

154
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:51,160
Charlottesville I'd like to provide the
nation with an update because that was

155
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,980
right after the event the first one
right an update on ongoing federal

156
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,940
response to the horrific attack and
violence that was witnessed by everybody

157
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,040
to anyone who acted criminally in this
weekend's racist violence you will be

158
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,750
held fully accountable justice will be
delivered so I said listen to that I

159
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:19,090
said that but they don't show that they
don't show it they talk they'll take one

160
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,930
thing like seriously he was late was the
best thing he was late so I said to

161
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:30,580
anyone who acted criminally in this
weekend's racist violence okay

162
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:36,160
then I go we must love each other show
affection for each other and unite

163
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,900
together in condemnation of hatred
bigotry and violence we must rediscover

164
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,690
the bonds of love and loyalty that bring
us together as Americans right then I

165
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:54,790
said racism is evil did they report that
I said that racism is evil

166
00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:03,940
you know why because they are very
dishonest people so I said racism is

167
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,420
evil now they only choose you know like
a half a sentence here or there and then

168
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,110
they just go on to this long rampage or
they put on these real light weights all

169
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:17,200
around a table that nobody ever heard of
and they all say what a bad guy I am but

170
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,430
I mean do you ever see anything and then
you wonder why CNN is doing relatively

171
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:26,470
poorly in the ratings because they're
putting like seven people all negative

172
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:34,780
and trouble and they fired Jeffrey Lord
poor Jeffrey Jeffrey look I guess he was

173
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:39,640
getting a little bit fed up and he was
probably fighting back a little too hard

174
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,300
they said we'd better get out of here we
get her back and those who cause

175
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:50,020
violence in its name are criminals and
thugs including the KKK neo-nazis white

176
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,290
supremacists and other hate groups that
are repugnant to everything we hold true

177
00:21:56,290 --> 00:22:00,930
as Americans now let me ask you can it
be any better than that in all fairness

178
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:08,110
and you know I mentioned that but to the
best of my knowledge when there was a

179
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:15,760
big problem Barack Obama never said it
took place because of radical Islamic

180
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,250
terrorists he never said that right he
doesn't have to say

181
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:24,350
you know why because they have a double
standard because the media is totally

182
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,890
dishonest and they have a double
standard you've never heard them say

183
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,930
that and in fact if you use the term you
get criticized but with me they wanted

184
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:36,770
me to say it I said it and I said it
very clearly but they refused to put it

185
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:44,180
on those who spread violence in the name
of bigotry strike the very core of

186
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:50,060
America these are my words this was on
Monday August the 14th see it's Saturday

187
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,990
yet Monday I mean I was going to do one
of these every week but you would never

188
00:22:53,990 --> 00:23:00,380
get it right in time such as these
America has always shown its true

189
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:06,710
character responding to hate with love
division with unity and violence with an

190
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:12,440
unwavering resolve for justice then I
finished I said we will defend and

191
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,380
protect the sacred rights of all
Americans all is capitalized timez5 not

192
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:26,600
just you and we will work together so
that every citizen every citizen in this

193
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,590
blessed land is free to follow their
dreams and their hearts and to express

194
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,190
the love and joy in their selves ok now
I mean

195
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:50,779
so so they were having a hard time with
that one because I said everything I hit

196
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:56,059
him with neo-nazi I hit him with
everything I I got the white supremacist

197
00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:02,629
the neo-nazi I got them all in there
let's say yeah KKK we have KKK I got him

198
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:05,929
on so they're having a hard time so what
did they say

199
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:12,799
right it should have been sooner he's a
racist it should have been soon okay so

200
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:20,899
it should have been so then the last one
on Tuesday Tuesday I didn't know we

201
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:25,340
condemn in the strongest possible terms
this egregious display of hatred bigotry

202
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:31,059
and violence it has no place in America

203
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:42,659
but they also said that he must be a
racist because he never mentioned the

204
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,240
driver of the car who is a terrible
person drove the car and he killed

205
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,370
Heather and it's a terrible thing but
they said I didn't mention so these are

206
00:24:53,370 --> 00:25:01,429
my words the driver of the car is a
murderer and what he did was a horrible

207
00:25:01,429 --> 00:25:07,379
inexcusable thing they said I didn't
mention and then they asked me just to

208
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:13,080
finish it they asked me what about race
relations in the United States

209
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,200
now I have to say they were pretty bad
under Barack Obama that I can tell you

210
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:27,720
but but they asked me the question and I
said well I think jobs can have a very

211
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,389
big and positive impact I think if we
continue to create jobs like I've done

212
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:38,629
over 1 million since I've been in office

213
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:46,040
way over well I think if we continue to
create jobs at levels that I'm creating

214
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:52,400
jobs I think that's going to have a
tremendously positive impact on race

215
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:59,480
relations I do I do
and the other thing very important I

216
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,890
believe wages will start going up
because we now have the lowest

217
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:11,410
unemployment rate we've had in 17 years
so you're going to see rages go up but

218
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,470
they haven't gone up for a long time I
believe wages now because the economy is

219
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,950
doing so well with respect to employment
and unemployment

220
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:28,910
I believe wages will start to go up and
I think that will have a tremendously

221
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:43,760
positive impact on race relations

222
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:51,320
so that was my words now you know I was
a good student I always hear about the

223
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:55,250
elite you know the elite they're elite I
went to better schools and they did I

224
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:59,780
was a better student than they were I
live in a bigger more beautiful

225
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,330
apartment and I live in the White House
too which is really great

226
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:15,530
I think you know what I think we're the
elites they're not the elites so the

227
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:20,180
point is and I didn't want to bore you
because you understand where I'm coming

228
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,760
from you people understand but the point
is that those were three different there

229
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,170
were two sabers in one news conference
the words were perfect they only take

230
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:35,680
out anything they can think of and for
the most part all they do is complain

231
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,130
but they don't put on those words and
they don't put on me saying those words

232
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:46,070
the media can attack me but where I draw
the line is when they attack you which

233
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:52,900
is what they do when they attack the
decency of our supporters

234
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,430
you are honest hard-working tax-paying
and by the way you're overtaxed but

235
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,660
we're going to get your taxes down

236
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:15,519
you're taxpaying Americans who love our
nation obey our laws and care for our

237
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:22,659
people it's time to expose the crooked
media deceptions and to challenge the

238
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:36,730
media for their role in for menteng
divisions and yes by the way and yes by

239
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:42,840
the way they are trying to take away our
history and our heritage you see them

240
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:51,710
and and I say it and you know we're all
pros we're all like we have a certain

241
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:58,940
sense with smart people these are truly
dishonest people and not all of them not

242
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,030
all of them you have some very good
reporters you have some very fair

243
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,790
journalists but for the most part
honestly these are really really

244
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:13,190
dishonest people and they're bad people
and I really think they don't like our

245
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:16,820
country I really believe that and I
don't believe they're going to change

246
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,900
and that's why I do this if they would
change I would never say it

247
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,980
the only people giving a platform to
these hate groups is the media itself in

248
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:37,870
the fake news

249
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:44,350
oh that's so funny look back there the
live red lights that turning those

250
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:53,460
suckers off fast out there they're
turning those lights off fast

251
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,760
like CNN CNN does not want it's falling
viewership to watch what I'm saying

252
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,940
tonight I could I mean the advantage I
have the advantage I have is that we do

253
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:13,740
have a big voice and you know they're
always saying like Twitter or social

254
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:17,850
media if I didn't have social media I
wouldn't be able to get the word out I

255
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,260
probably wouldn't be standing here right
I probably wouldn't be saying yeah well

256
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:29,070
if I don't have social media I probably
would not be standing and you ever

257
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,150
noticed when I go on and I'll put like
out a tweet or a couple of tweets he's

258
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:37,980
in a Twitter storm again I don't do
Twitter stuff you know you'll put on a

259
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,120
little tweet I'm going to be with the
veterans today they'll say Donald Trump

260
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,890
is in a Twitter storm these are sick
people you know the thing I don't

261
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:53,490
understand you would think you would
think they'd want to make our country

262
00:30:53,490 --> 00:31:00,810
great again and I honestly believe they
don't I honestly believe if you want to

263
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:07,740
discover the source of the division in
our country look no further than the

264
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:13,930
fake news in the crooked media

265
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:22,540
which would rather get ratings and
clicks then tell the truth I mean the

266
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,570
New York Times has written some stories
how about this the New York Times

267
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:34,330
essentially apologized after I won the
election because their coverage was so

268
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:39,180
bad and it was so wrong and they were
losing so many subscribers that they

269
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,630
practically apologized I would say they
did they say well it wasn't really that

270
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,320
much of an apology because they were
losing so many people because they were

271
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,370
misled and I think if this is great and
for about two weeks I got good coverage

272
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,300
then they reverted back and they're
worse than ever before you know it's

273
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,410
like one of those things the Washington
Post is terrible but these are dishonest

274
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,080
but let me tell you you have some great
honest papers you have some great

275
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,060
networks I must tell you
Fox has treated me fairly Fox treated me

276
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,240
fine

277
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:20,309
they've treated me fairly hey I'll let
you know you know what someday they

278
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:23,279
might not treat me fairly and I'll tell
you about it okay

279
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:27,240
but they've treated me fairly and I
don't mean all good I get plenty of bad

280
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,070
on fox too but at least it's within
reason and Hannity how good is Hannity

281
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:44,340
he say how good is Hannity and he's a
great guy and he's an honest guy and Fox

282
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:49,649
and Friends in the morning is the best
show and it's the absolute most honest

283
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:55,590
show and it's the show i watch not only
just oh boy those cameras are going off

284
00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:01,429
oh wow why don't you just fold them up
and take them home

285
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:12,520
oh those cameras are going off wow

286
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,960
that's the one thing they're very
nervous to have me on live television

287
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:25,670
because this can't happen now you know
what I'm a person that wants to tell the

288
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:33,170
truth I'm an honest person and what I'm
saying you know is exactly right not

289
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:38,720
only does the media give a platform to
hate groups but the media turns a blind

290
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,170
eye to the gang violence on our streets
the failures of our public school the

291
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:50,570
destruction of our wealth at the hands
of the terrible terrible trade deals

292
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:57,430
made by politicians that should have
never been allowed to be politicians

293
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,870
and the unaccountable hostility against
our incredible police who worked so hard

294
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:13,179
and such a dangerous job my
administration is committed to the idea

295
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:18,069
that all Americans have the right to
live in safety security and peace we

296
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:23,530
believe in the rule of law because we
know that freedom cannot exist if our

297
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:31,440
people are not safe and how safe are you
at a trump rally

298
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,189
remember at the beginning remember when
this already started when this started

299
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:47,080
at the beginning they used to send in
thugs they'd swing like people are

300
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,290
tougher than them so it wasn't always
very good for that but they send in

301
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,940
thugs and our people would protect
themselves and then you'd go home and

302
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,960
you'd watch this violence let me tell
you see this room you got people outside

303
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,370
but not very many but see this room
you're safe in this room you're very

304
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:12,550
safe in this room the big room the most
sacred duty of government is to protect

305
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:17,130
the lives of its citizens and that
includes securing our borders and

306
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:48,189
enforcing our immigration laws

307
00:35:48,819 --> 00:36:43,489
by the way I'm just curious do the
people in this room like Sheriff Joe

308
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:52,599
so was Sheriff Joe convicted for doing
his job

309
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,079
that's what

310
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:04,049
he should have had a jury but you know
what I'll make a prediction I think he's

311
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:06,890
going to be just fine okay

312
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:26,500
but but I won't do it tonight because I
don't want to cause any controversy is

313
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:30,210
that okay all right

314
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:37,719
but Sheriff Joe can feel good the people
of Arizona know the deadly and

315
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:43,599
heartbreaking consequences of illegal
immigration the lost lives the drugs the

316
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,959
gangs the cartels the crisis of
smuggling and trafficking ms-13 we're

317
00:37:49,959 --> 00:37:55,239
throwing them out so fast they never got
thrown out of anything like this we are

318
00:37:55,239 --> 00:38:00,429
liberating towns out on Long Island
we're liberating can you imagine in this

319
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:06,279
day and age in this day and age in this
country we are liberating towns this is

320
00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:11,199
like from a different age we are taking
these people they don't shoot people

321
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,890
because it's too fast and not painful
they cut them up into little pieces

322
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,939
these are animals we are getting them
out of here we're throwing them in jails

323
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:26,859
and we're throwing them out of the
country we're liberating our town you've

324
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:33,039
seen it you've lived it and you elected
me to put a stop to it

325
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:40,049
and we are doing a phenomenal job of
putting a stop to it that I can tell you

326
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:47,090
after years of defending other countries
borders can you believe we fight for

327
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:49,570
other countries we want to defend their
borders

328
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:55,210
we're finally defending our own borders

329
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:03,760
and we're showing compassion for the
struggling American workers who are now

330
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,590
starting to see the light because plants
are coming pouring back into our country

331
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:13,450
and by the way we're doing a lot of good
work on that but a lot of people are

332
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,630
coming back in we have Foxconn they make
the iPhones as you know for Apple and so

333
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:29,170
many companies are building now in our
country including the auto companies who

334
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:35,170
are coming back years of uncontrolled
immigration have placed enormous

335
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:40,630
pressure on the jobs and wages of
working families and they've put great

336
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:46,090
burdens or local schools and hospitals
well this may be good for a handful of

337
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:51,520
special interests it's unfair to working
people of all backgrounds all throughout

338
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,160
our country we want every American
community to succeed including our

339
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:06,270
immigrant communities but they can't do
that if we don't control our borders

340
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:17,640
earlier today I visited with the
incredible men and women of ice and the

341
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:26,340
Border Patrol during a visit to human
sector I was over at the Yuma sector it

342
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,620
was hot like a hundred and fifteen
degrees I'm out signing autographs for

343
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:37,590
an hour I was there that was a hot day
you learn if you're in shape if you can

344
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,660
do that believe me and they actually
told me actually sir it's relatively

345
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,950
cool today can you believe that but it
was great and I met with the Border

346
00:40:46,950 --> 00:41:00,289
Patrol and I met with ice and these are
incredible people the job they do

347
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:09,150
in fact general Kelly who was in charge
of homeland security where people coming

348
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:17,580
in down 78 and almost 80% he did so good
I made him my chief of staff right that

349
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:24,320
made Sir John where's John where is it
where's general Kelly get him out here

350
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:31,200
he's great he's doing a great job but we
did a lot before anything happened we

351
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,470
did a lot we respect and cherish our ice
officers and our Border Patrol agents

352
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:44,850
and we respect and cherish our police
officers and our fire men and all of our

353
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:52,230
uniformed services but during that visit
I heard firsthand from the frontline

354
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:57,600
agents about the security threats they
confront each and every day and I

355
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:04,620
pledged my continued resolve to them and
all of you to keep our country safe all

356
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:10,770
around the nation I have spent time with
the wonderful Americans whose children

357
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:17,640
were killed for the simple reason that
our government failed to enforce our

358
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:26,940
immigration laws already existing laws
and I promise these families the deaths

359
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:33,780
of their loved ones will not have been
in vain I promise them I know so many of

360
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,960
them

361
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:42,380
one by one we are finding the gang
members the drug dealers and the

362
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:47,360
criminals who prey on our people we are
throwing them out of the country or

363
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:52,540
we're putting them the hell fast in jail

364
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,820
we are cracking down on the sanctuary
cities that shield criminal aliens

365
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,690
finally

366
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,090
and we are building a wall on the
southern border which is absolutely

367
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:27,800
necessary

368
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:44,569
build that wall
now the obstructionist democrats would

369
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:48,589
like us not to do it but believe me we
have to close down our government we're

370
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:56,119
building that wall let me be very clear
two Democrats in Congress who oppose a

371
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:02,839
border wall and stand in the way of
border security you are putting all of

372
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:09,430
America's safety at risk you're doing
that you're doing that again the border

373
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:14,750
patrol today I said how important is the
wall to some of the folks I met with a

374
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:21,260
lot of them and they looked at me they
said it's vital it's vital it's so vital

375
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,550
and you know we have walls I don't know
if you know we're already starting to

376
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,240
fix a lot of the walls we already have
because we don't have to rebuild them

377
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,480
and we want walls that you can see
through in a sense you want to see

378
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,809
what's on the other side but we're
starting to fix a lot of the walls we've

379
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:40,339
done a lot of work but I said to them
how are we doing and how important are

380
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:45,710
the walls and they said mr. president
you have no idea it is desperately

381
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:49,750
needed we're gonna have our wall we're
gonna get our wall

382
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:00,750
and that wall is also going to help us
very importantly with the drug problem

383
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:08,060
and the massive amounts of drugs that
are pouring across the southern border

384
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:15,570
my administration will never back down
and demanding immigration control the

385
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:22,230
American people voted for immigration
control that's one of the reasons I'm

386
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:29,100
here and that is what the American
people deserve and they're going to get

387
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,280
it

388
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:40,150
so you put pressure but believe me one
way or the other we're gonna get that

389
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:46,060
wall immigration security is also a
matter

390
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:51,160
remember this of national security
that's why we're implementing tough new

391
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:57,130
vetting and screening protocols to keep
radical Islamic terrorists out of our

392
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:59,340
country

393
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:09,220
you look at what just happened in Spain
and so many other places nope we're

394
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:13,000
really vetting we're tough does anybody
want would it be soft on the vetting or

395
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,310
would you like with extreme vetting I
came up with that term it is what it has

396
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:28,830
to be so I have a message for Congress
tonight your job is to represent

397
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:36,090
American families American people
American workers to job

398
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:51,109
you need to represent them on the border
on taxes on health care one vote

399
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:59,210
and on every other issue that affects
their lives and for our friends in the

400
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,450
Senate oh boy

401
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:17,109
the Senate remember this look the Senate
we have to get rid of what's called the

402
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:26,740
filibuster rule we have to and if we
don't the Republicans will never get

403
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:30,990
anything passed you're wasting your time

404
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:38,200
we have to get rid of the filibuster
rule right now we need 60 votes and we

405
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:44,950
have 52 Republicans that means that
eight Democrats are controlling all of

406
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,859
this legislation we have over 200 bills

407
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:57,329
and we have to speak to Mitch and we
have to speak to everybody and I want to

408
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:03,779
tell you we have some great great
Republican senators we really do and

409
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:13,049
they fought like hell to get that thing
a pro they fought they really did we

410
00:48:13,049 --> 00:48:19,859
they really fought now even on health
care because of reconciliation which you

411
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:24,959
don't know it doesn't matter it's a
trick we needed 51 votes but when you

412
00:48:24,959 --> 00:48:30,150
need 51 and you have 52 and we include
the vice president who always voted with

413
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:39,059
us he's the greatest but you have no
margin but some of the best things in

414
00:48:39,059 --> 00:48:44,819
health care require 60 votes so even
when you say we're voting on health care

415
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:49,920
like across state lines purchase across
state lines one of the most important

416
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,859
things I've been talking about it for
two years during debates

417
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:58,859
it gives competition insurance companies
come in your prices go way down Arizona

418
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:06,420
is a disaster in terms of the price
increase of your insurance 116 percent

419
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:12,959
increase you got to get rid of the
filibuster rule you got to go to a

420
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:18,150
majority you got to go to 51 votes and
if they don't do that they're play

421
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:25,499
they're just wasting time all of the
Democrats in Congress that's the only

422
00:49:25,499 --> 00:49:28,619
thing they do well they do one thing
well you know what it's called they have

423
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:34,219
no ideas they have no policies they
obstruct that's all they do

424
00:49:34,219 --> 00:49:40,049
their word is we resist they don't
resist they obstruct it's all they're

425
00:49:40,049 --> 00:49:45,630
good at it's all they're good if that's
all they do on health care they have 48

426
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:51,209
Democrats we got no votes
we got no votes and it would have been

427
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:55,529
great health care and by the way would
have been great health care for Arizona

428
00:49:55,529 --> 00:50:03,359
would have been great so the Democrats
have no ideas no policy no vision for

429
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:07,250
the country
other than total socialism and maybe

430
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:12,250
frankly a step beyond socialism from
what I'm seeing

431
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:21,559
under their plan for America your taxes
will double or triple your services will

432
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:26,869
diminish and your borders will be left
wide open for everybody to come in and

433
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:38,480
enjoy our country Obamacare is a
disaster and think think we were just

434
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:46,700
one vote away from victory after seven
years of everybody proclaiming repeal

435
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:59,799
and replace one vote away one one one
vote away

436
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:10,600
we were one vote away think of it seven
years the Republicans and again you have

437
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:19,080
some great senators but we at one vote
away from repealing

438
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:42,279
but you know they all said mr. president
your speech was so good last night

439
00:51:42,279 --> 00:51:54,869
please please mr. president don't
mention any names so I won't I won't

440
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:11,390
no I won't vote one vote away I will not
mention any names very presidential is

441
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:18,440
it very president and nobody wants me to
talk about your other senator who's weak

442
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:24,340
on borders weak on crime so I won't talk
about him

443
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:36,220
nobody wants me to talk about him nobody
knows who the hell he is and now see I

444
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:44,650
haven't mentioned any names so now
everybody's happy but we are going to

445
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:51,400
get rid of Obamacare I will never stop
one vote I will never stop we're going

446
00:52:51,400 --> 00:53:03,250
to get rid of Obamacare every day we're
keeping our promises and that includes

447
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:13,290
our promises to our great great veterans
who's a veteran here it's getting better

448
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:19,480
getting really good nobody's fixing
nobody's been able to do and remember

449
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,340
I'm only here for less than eight months
you know when they talk about Obamacare

450
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:30,250
it was years when they talked about
Hillary Clinton spent eight years trying

451
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:32,670
to get

452
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,950
eight years trying to get health care

453
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:02,710
well it's obvious that we won the state
of Arizona do you agree with pretty.i

454
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:10,549
and we wanted by a lot and I hear we're
winning it by even more right now but if

455
00:54:10,549 --> 00:54:13,640
you think about it Clinton they spent
eight years than they weren't able to

456
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,119
get health care other administration
spent all of their time they weren't

457
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:21,980
able to get it
Obama what he did to get it what he did

458
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:27,710
to get it including the guy Gert Gruber
did you see Gruber got fired yesterday

459
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:33,950
he got fired because he defrauded
somebody or something something very bad

460
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:41,089
happened check it out something happened
Gruber who lied about Obamacare who

461
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:47,000
called everybody fools for believing it
Obamacare is gone it's a disaster is

462
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,789
gone premiums and other states are going
up at numbers that are even higher than

463
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:57,380
the state of Arizona
insurance companies are fleeing and it's

464
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,660
gone so wicked I really believe that the
Republicans and maybe we'll get a couple

465
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,839
of senators that think they're going to
lose their race on the Democratic side

466
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:14,019
maybe but we'll get we'll get it fixed
one vote speak to your senator please

467
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:18,339
speak to your senator

468
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,900
we're reforming the VA to ensure our
veterans have the care they so richly

469
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:34,920
deserve
including choice choice choice in other

470
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:39,450
words if you've got to wait for seven
days and you're not feeling well you go

471
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:45,289
see a doctor and we pay for your doctor
isn't that good and we got legislation

472
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:48,930
approved that everybody said was
impossible

473
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:54,869
it's called VA accountability if
somebody treats our veterans badly we

474
00:55:54,869 --> 00:56:00,410
can fire them we say you're fired get
out of here

475
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:08,700
everybody said everybody said you
couldn't get that they've been trying to

476
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:13,049
get that passed for 40 years
we got great legislation you ever hear

477
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:17,460
these liars back there where they say
but Trump has gotten let you say I think

478
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,799
we've gotten more in a short period of
time in this seven months I think we've

479
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:27,660
gotten more than anybody including Harry
Truman who was number one

480
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,960
but they will tell you we got none so we
got VA accountability so that you can

481
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,859
fire people that are treating our
veterans badly or aren't doing their job

482
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:49,319
as neckla we've also obtained historic
increase in defense spending to prevent

483
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:55,559
and deter conflict we believe in peace
through strength were building up our

484
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:04,230
military like never before thousands and
thousands of brave Americans have paid

485
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:09,559
the ultimate price for our freedom now
it's up to us to preserve and protect

486
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:16,410
their legacy last night as you know I
laid out my vision for an honorable and

487
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:22,339
enduring outcome in a very tough place a
place where our country has failed

488
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:28,529
Afghanistan this is a place where
terrorists are trained where you have

489
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:35,789
people that are not exactly United
States fans can I say that

490
00:57:35,789 --> 00:57:43,539
and I will tell you that what we're
going to do with our incredible military

491
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:49,509
they're going to make unbelievable
sacrifices and they've already made in

492
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:55,420
some cases the ultimate sacrifice but
we're fighting for them our war fighters

493
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:04,079
deserve the tools they need and the
trust they've earned to fight and to win

494
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:16,170
fight into work and you see what's going
on in North Korea all of a sudden I

495
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:22,150
don't know who knows but I can tell you
what I said that's not strong enough

496
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:29,349
some people said it was too strong it's
not strong enough but kim jeong-hoon

497
00:58:29,349 --> 00:58:37,449
I respect the fact that I believe he is
starting to respect us I respect that

498
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:46,869
fact very much respect that fact and
maybe probably not but maybe something

499
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:52,569
positive can come about they won't tell
you that but maybe something positive

500
00:58:52,569 --> 00:58:58,119
can come about every American deserves
the government that protects them honors

501
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:05,829
them defends them and fights for them
and by the way speaking of that you have

502
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:10,059
three congressmen in the audience and
your governor who met me at the plane

503
00:59:10,059 --> 00:59:16,869
and he's now inside but he said I want
to spend my time outside on security I

504
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:20,679
said I think that's a great idea
governor but not that many people showed

505
00:59:20,679 --> 00:59:24,279
up so I don't think it should be much of
a problem but you have a hell of a

506
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:33,119
governor governor Ducey you have a great
governor and we have three congressmen a

507
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,459
friend of mine who has been so great to
me Trent Franks where's congressman

508
00:59:39,459 --> 00:59:50,369
friend where is

509
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:58,519

Thank You congressman never let them go

them thank you fellas

513
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:48,609
so in Washington were taking power out
of the hands of donors and special

514
01:00:48,609 --> 01:00:53,799
interests and putting that power back
into the hands of the people that voted

515
01:00:53,799 --> 01:01:00,130
for us okay for us the same failed
voices in Washington who opposed our

516
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:06,459
movement are the same people who gave us
one terrible trade deal after another

517
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:12,969
who gave us one foreign policy disaster
after another who sacrificed our

518
01:01:12,969 --> 01:01:21,420
sovereignty our wealth and our jobs we
don't need advice from the Washington DC

519
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:35,140
swamp we need right now to drain the
swamp that's what's happening to

520
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:42,539
believer Washington is full of people
who are only looking out for themselves

521
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:48,219
but I don't come to Washington for me
you know I've had a great life I've had

522
01:01:48,219 --> 01:01:55,109
great success I've enjoyed my life most
people think I'm crazy to have done this

523
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:06,370
and I think they're right but I enjoyed
cuz we've made so much I don't believe

524
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:12,910
that any president I don't believe that
any president has accomplished as much

525
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:20,670
as this president in the first six or
seven months I really don't believe

526
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:37,070
including including a great Supreme
Court justice justice courses big I came

527
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:44,180
to Washington for you your dreams of my
dreams your hopes are my hopes and your

528
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:53,750
future is what I'm fighting for each and
every day it's so important our agenda

529
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:59,390
is the pro-worker agenda we've
accomplished historic amounts in a short

530
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:05,210
period of time we've signed more than 50
pieces of legislation they said we've

531
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:13,760
signed none none we've signed 50
appointed justice courses nominated 31

532
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:20,410
new federal judges with many more on the
way

533
01:03:22,839 --> 01:03:29,660
so importantly we have aggressively
cancelled job-killing regulations and

534
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:39,849
we're unleashing job-creating American
energy like we've never unleashed before

535
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:50,119
we've ended the war on beautiful clean
call and it's just been announced that a

536
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:55,820
second brand-new coal mine where they're
going to take out clean coal meaning to

537
01:03:55,820 --> 01:04:00,500
take it out coal they're going to clean
it is opening in the state of

538
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:12,920
Pennsylvania the second way and the
state of West Virginia which was way

539
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:21,500
behind and lagging was now in terms of
GDP increase second last quarter to the

540
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:29,480
state of Texas how about that West
Virginia and they have a great governor

541
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:37,190
in West Virginia Governor Jim Justice
who just quit the Democrats and joined

542
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:40,900
the Republican Party

543
01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:50,969
in the proud tradition of America's
great leaders from George Washington

544
01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:57,660
please don't take his statue dumb please
please does anybody want George

545
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,739
Washington's statue

546
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:10,589
no is that sad is that whole sad -
Lincoln - Teddy Roosevelt I see they

547
01:05:10,589 --> 01:05:15,479
want to take Teddy Roosevelt's down -
they're trying to figure out why they

548
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:20,489
don't know they're trying to take away
our culture they're trying to take away

549
01:05:20,489 --> 01:05:25,799
our history and our weak leaders they do
it overnight these things have been

550
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:31,469
there for 150 years for a hundred years
you go back to a university and it's

551
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:39,890
gone
weak weak people we are going to protect

552
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:45,929
American industry we are going to
protect the American worker no longer

553
01:05:45,929 --> 01:05:52,919
will we allow other countries to close
our factories steal our jobs and drain

554
01:05:52,919 --> 01:05:59,989
our wealth we are building our future
with American hands American labor

555
01:05:59,989 --> 01:06:05,449
American iron aluminum and steel

556
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:20,080
we will buy American and we will hire
American I immediately withdrew the

557
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:26,140
United States from the disastrous
trans-pacific partnership would have

558
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:35,050
been a disaster and you know that one of
the worst deals that anybody in history

559
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:42,280
has ever entered into we have begun
formal renegotiation with Mexico and

560
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:52,270
Canada on NAFTA and I must be honest and
I've been talking about NAFTA for a long

561
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:57,670
time and I'm sorry it's taken six months
but we have to give notice you have to

562
01:06:57,670 --> 01:07:01,600
see this we have to give notice and
after the notice is given you have to

563
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,330
wait a long time then you have to give
it nothing then you have to wait a long

564
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:11,350
time anyway we started two days ago Bob
light Iser personally I don't think we

565
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:16,660
can make a deal because we have been so
badly taken advantage of they have made

566
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:21,040
such great deals both of the countries
but in particular Mexico then I don't

567
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:25,600
think we can make a deal so I think
we'll end up probably terminating NAFTA

568
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:33,940
at some point okay probably but but I
told you from the first day we will

569
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:39,250
renegotiate NAFTA or we will terminate
NAFTA I personally don't think you can

570
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:42,400
make a deal without a termination but
we're going to see what happens okay

571
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:48,850
you're in you're in good hands I can
tell you we are unleashing American

572
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:57,190
energy and I withdrew the United States
from the job-killing Paris climate

573
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:59,790
Accord

574
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:11,140
people have no idea how bad that was for
this country great for other countries

575
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:17,680
we were like the lap dog great for other
countries our country was so behind

576
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:23,750
since I took the oath of office we've
added far more than 1 million jobs in

577
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:31,819
the private sector unemployment is right
now at almost a 17-year low wages are

578
01:08:31,819 --> 01:08:38,449
rising the stock market is at its
all-time high in history and economic

579
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:45,050
growth has surged to 2.6 percent
remember everybody said you won't bring

580
01:08:45,050 --> 01:08:50,450
it up to 1 percent you won't bring it up
to 1.2 percent and we've just started

581
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,109
those regulations that we've gotten rid
of which and we're gonna have some

582
01:08:54,109 --> 01:08:59,019
regulation but it's going to be sensible
regulation those regulations are

583
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:06,050
unleashing our economy so we have a GDP
we're shocking about two weeks ago it

584
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:10,520
was announced for the quarter 2.6
percent remember I said we're going to

585
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,689
try and hit three percent we're already
at 2.6 maybe I'll have to increase my

586
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:27,709
offer and so many of those people you
know the Economic Council when it got a

587
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:31,760
little heat with the lives from the
media they sort of said oh we'll take a

588
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,240
piss what not all of them but some of
them did but I remember the ones that

589
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,910
did but they'll see we take all will
take but people are now calling me

590
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:45,979
people that have been like we'll take a
pass Don can we get together for lunch

591
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:51,009
let's do it privately instead of through
a council these people just don't get it

592
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:56,150
they are calling and they're saying how
about getting together privately they

593
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,960
like it better why should they be on a
council you know that's the way it is

594
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:05,300
folks that's the way it is to bring more
jobs and Industry to our shores we are

595
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:12,100
committed to passing the first major tax
reform in over 30 years

596
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:24,030
now we need the help of Congress please
okay we need the help of Congress and we

597
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:29,789
really could use some Democrat help
we're giving you the biggest tax cut in

598
01:10:29,789 --> 01:10:35,849
the history of our country the Democrats
are going to find a way to obstruct if

599
01:10:35,849 --> 01:10:41,820
they do remember they are stopping you
from getting a massive tax cut just

600
01:10:41,820 --> 01:10:47,820
remember that okay
America's crushing business tax is a

601
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:54,269
massive self-inflicted economic wound we
have one of the highest business tax

602
01:10:54,269 --> 01:10:57,869
rates anywhere in the world
pushing jobs and wealth out of our

603
01:10:57,869 --> 01:11:03,210
country that is why we are going to
lower the tax on American business to

604
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:08,550
bring back those companies bring them
back to America we want more product

605
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:14,389
stamped with the letters made in the USA

606
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:23,050
we also on everyday Americans to be able
to keep more of their own money so for

607
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:28,329
the Democratic senators especially the
ones where I won their states by twenty

608
01:11:28,329 --> 01:11:32,289
and thirty points
I really hope you're going to come over

609
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:38,679
to our side because again when you have
fifty-two Republicans if you lose like

610
