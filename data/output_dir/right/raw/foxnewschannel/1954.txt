00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:25,254

YEAR BY NOVARTIS.

26
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:45,707
ESSENTIAL CONSULTING WAS ONE

27
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:47,042
OF SEVERAL FIRMS WE ENGAGED

00:00:47,042 --> 00:00:49,111

INSIGHTS INTO UNDERSTANDING

00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,313
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION.

31
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:53,115
THEY DID NO LEGAL OR

32
00:00:53,115 --> 00:00:54,716
LOBBYING WORK FOR US AND THE

00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,888
IN A STATEMENT TO FOX NEWS,

36
00:00:59,888 --> 00:01:01,924

STUCK TOGETHER, NOVARTIS

40
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:10,933
SAYING BELIEVED MICHAEL

41
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:11,967
COHEN COULD ADVISE THE

42
00:01:11,967 --> 00:01:14,970
COMPANY AS TO HOW THE TRUMP

43
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,573
ADMINISTRATION MIGHT CERTAIN

44
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:18,240
HEALTHCARE MATTERS INCLUDING

45
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,675

AFTER ONE MEETING NOVART

47
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:23,712
SIR.

48
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,880
WOULD BE UNABLE TO PRESIDE

49
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,682
THE SERVICES ANTICIPATED

50
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:27,716
RELATED TO U.S. HEALTHCARE

51
00:01:27,716 --> 00:01:28,517
POLICY MATTERS AND THE

52
00:01:28,517 --> 00:01:30,786
DECISION WAS TAKEN NOT TONE

53
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:31,620
GAUGE FURTHER.

54
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,822
BASICALLY THEY GAVE MICHAEL

55
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:34,489
COHEN $1.2 MILLION FOR A

56
00:01:34,489 --> 00:01:36,491
SINGLE MEETING, SHEP.

57
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,694
THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT.

58
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:40,128
MICHAEL AVENATTI WILL NOT

59
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:41,129
SAY WHERE HE GOT THE

60
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:41,930
INFORMATION ON THE FINANCIAL

61
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,264
RECORDS.

62
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,866
THE TREASURY'S OFFICE ON THE

63
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:44,533
INSPECTOR GENERAL LOOKING

64
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,435
INTO ALL OF THAT SHEP?

65
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:47,669
>> Shepard: JOHN ROBERTS

66
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,705
BACK LIVE WHEN THE BRIEFING

67
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:50,038
BEGINS.

68
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:50,973
FIRST TO DEFENSE ATTORNEY

69
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:51,773
AND FORMER PROSECUTOR U TO

70
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:54,076
BE CLEAR, RUSSIAN OLIGARCH

71
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:56,712
AND THEN NOVARTIS SAYS THERE

72
00:01:56,712 --> 00:01:57,980
WAS ONE MEETING AND THEY

73
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,248
DETERMINED OH, NOT SO MUCH

74
00:01:59,248 --> 00:02:00,949
BUT THEY KEPT PAYING HIM

75
00:02:00,949 --> 00:02:02,551
EVERY MONTH $1.2 MILLION.

76
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:07,055
THE QUESTION IS RE THEY

77
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:08,122
GIVING MONEY FOR ACCESS TO

78
00:02:08,122 --> 00:02:09,291
TRUMP AND DID ANY OF THE

79
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,392
MONEY EVENTUALLY GO TO

80
00:02:10,392 --> 00:02:10,692
TRUMP?

81
00:02:10,692 --> 00:02:11,360
>> THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS

82
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,961
THAT ARE UNANSWERED, SHEP.

83
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,795
CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING

84
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:15,964
THAT THE FBI, NOT ONLY IS

85
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:16,999
LOOKING AT, ALREADY HAS

86
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:17,833
LOOKED AT.

87
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,501
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THAT

88
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:20,669
THE CHARGES THAT ARE BEING

89
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,771
LOOKED AT WERE REMANDED BACK

90
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:24,139
TO NEW YORK SO THEY MAY NOT

91
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:25,407
HAVE SEEN ANYTHING

92
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,175
NECESSARILY WITH A

93
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:28,644
CONNECTION BETWEEN COHEN'S

94
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:30,812
ACTIVITIES AND THE

95
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:31,546
TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION.

96
00:02:31,546 --> 00:02:33,048
YOU KNOW, SHEP, WHAT HAPPENS

97
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,816
IN POLITICS AND WHEN YOU

98
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:35,384
INVESTIGATE POLITICAL

99
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:37,085
CORRUPTION CASES IS GUYS

100
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:39,655
LIKE COHEN WANT TO SELL.

101
00:02:39,655 --> 00:02:41,123
THEY WANT TO PEDDLE OUT

102
00:02:41,123 --> 00:02:42,591
THERE HEY I HAVE INFLUENCE.

103
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:43,592

104
00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:44,626
I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,395
YOU HAVE PAY ME MONEY I WILL

I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHAT THE

108
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:49,464
CANDIDATE IS THINKING.

109
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:53,035
I WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW TO

110
00:02:53,168 --> 00:02:54,336
IT COULD BE THAT THOSE

111
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,905
COMPANIES WENT OUT THERE ON

112
00:02:56,905 --> 00:02:58,073
THE UNDER THE LINE OF THE

113
00:02:58,073 --> 00:03:00,008
LAW BUT NOT OVER THE LINE.

114
00:03:00,008 --> 00:03:00,709
>> Shepard: CLOSE TO SOMEONE

115
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:02,010
MAKING A REPRESENTATION.

116
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,611
I GOT HIS EAR.

117
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:04,613
I WILL LET YOU KNOW IN

118
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:05,714
ADVANCE WHAT HE IS THINKING.

119
00:03:05,714 --> 00:03:06,815
THEY COULD PAY FOR THAT

120
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:07,149
ACCESS.

121
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,084
WHEN IT BECOMES DICEY ORISM

122
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:10,585
LEGAL IS IF THE MONEY

123
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:11,253
CHANGES HAND BETWEEN THAT

124
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:12,487
PERSON AND THE PERSON NOW

125
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:13,155
EMPLOYED BY THE PEOPLE OF

126
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:13,655
THE UNITED STATES.

127
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,589
THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T KNOW.

128
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:15,424
>> RIGHT.

129
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:17,125
I CALL IT STRAIGHT AS A

130
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:17,526
PROSECUTOR.

131
00:03:17,526 --> 00:03:18,694
IT'S THOUGHT A DEMOCRAT OR

132
00:03:18,694 --> 00:03:19,294
REPUBLICAN ISSUE.

133
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:20,829
WHEN HE WOULD JUMPING TO

134
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,431
CONCLUSIONS THAT SOMEHOW

135
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:24,533
TRUMP EVEN KNEW WHAT IT WAS

136
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,735
THAT MICHAEL COHEN WAS

137
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:27,035
DOING.

138
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:29,204
IT COULD WELL BE.

139
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:30,572
>> Shepard: WHO JUMPED TO

140
00:03:30,572 --> 00:03:31,039
THAT CONCLUSION?

141
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,342
>> PEOPLE ARE SAYING IN THE

142
00:03:33,342 --> 00:03:34,910
MEDIA WEAPON.

143
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,611
>> Shepard: WE COULD KNOW HE

144
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,013
IS INVESTIGATING.

145
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:40,582
BOB MUELLER'S TEAM HAD

146
00:03:40,582 --> 00:03:41,717
ALREADY INTERVIEWED THIS

147
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:42,617
RUSSIAN OLIGARCH WHO STEPPED

148
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:46,822
OFF A PLANE ONE DAY, THEY

149
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,590
TRIED TO LOOK AT HIGG

150
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,691
DIGITAL RECORDS.

151
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:50,158
PHONE.

152
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,094
WHETHER THEY DID OR NOT IS

153
00:03:52,094 --> 00:03:53,595
ANOTHER MATTER.

154
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:54,329
DOCUMENTS REQUESTED TO.

155
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,664
THEY ARE WAY AHEAD OF PUBLIC

156
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:56,631
KNOWLEDGE ON THIS AS THEY

157
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:58,467
HAVE BEEN ON ALL OF.

158
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,502
THIS THEY HAD THE DATA AND

159
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:01,603
AFTER THEY INTERVIEWED THE

160
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:02,671
OLIGARCH, WHAT DID THEY DO?

161
00:04:02,671 --> 00:04:04,773
THEY DIDN'T RETAIN

162
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:05,273
JURISDICTION.

163
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:05,907
>> Shepard: THAT'S RIGHT.

164
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:07,209
>> IT WAS SENT BACK HERE.

165
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:08,443
WHICH, TO ME, INDICATES AT

166
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:09,911
LEAST IN THAT ASPECT THAT

167
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:10,946
THEY'RE NOT SEEING A

168
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:12,948

MORE OF A MICHAEL COHEN

173
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:20,154
PROBLEM.

174
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:20,822
>> Shepard: DETRACTORS HAVE

175
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:21,790
SAID THAT COULD BE THAT THE

OF THE INVESTIGATION FROM

180
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:28,330
MAYBE THE DISBANDING OF A

181

00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,805
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THAT IS

189
00:04:36,805 --> 00:04:37,172
TRUE.
