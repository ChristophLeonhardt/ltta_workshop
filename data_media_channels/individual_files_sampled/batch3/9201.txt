RATING. BRET? Bret: PETER, THANK YOU. NOW, TO CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER. REACTION HAS BEEN POURING IN FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND FROM AROUND THE WORLD FOLLOWING NEWS OF CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER'S DEATH YESTERDAY. TONIGHT, FOX NEWS MEDIA ANALYST AND HOST OF FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ HOWARD KURTZ LOOKS AT HOW THE KRAUTHAMMER STYLE OF ANALYSIS HAS SHAPED THE WAY NEWS IS COVERED TODAY. GOOD EVENING, HOWY. GOOD EVENING. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WAS A POWERFUL VOICE FOR THIS NETWORK IT WAS IN MISS WRITING FOR "THE WASHINGTON POST" AND "TIME" MAGAZINE HE MAY HAVE HAD HIS GREATEST IMPACT ON THE JOURNALISM BUSINESS. LEFT WING COMMENTATORS VIEWED HIM WITH ADMIRATION AND FOR THOSE LIKE LIBERAL POST COLUMNIST JEAN ROBINSON ON THE SAME SUBJECT A LITTLE NERVOUSNESS. I WOULD ALWAYS GIVE IT ANOTHER -MY COLUMN ANOTHER READ OR TWO BECAUSE I KNEW THAT CHARLES WOULD ATTACK HE WOULD SORT OF PREATTACK ALL OF THE WEAK BOYS IN THE ARGUMENT AND PICK THEM APART. HE FITS INTO A TRADITION IF YOU THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE BO BUCKLEY AND WHAT BO BUCKLEY MEANT FOR CONSERVATIVE THOUGHT IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU COME TO PEOPLE LIKE BILL SAPPHIRE WHO CAME OUT OF NIXON ADMINISTRATION. HE BEGAN AS A WALTER MONDALE SPEECH WRITER AND NEW REPUBLIC WRITER. IT WAS KRAUTHAMMER THE WORD SMITH WHO COINED THE BUSH DERANGEMENT SIN DRONEL. AND KRAUTHAMMER WHO DEFINED REAGAN FOREIGN POLICY. HE INVENTED THE REAGAN DOCTRINE NOT REAGAN. IT CODIFIED WHEN A LOT OF SORT OF FEELINGS THAT PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT HAD. KRAUTHAMMER TOOK PLENTY OF FLACK FOR HIS STEADFAST SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQ WAR. AND WAS VERY TOUGH ON PRESIDENT OBAMA. YET, HE WAS EQUALLY COMFORTABLE TAKING SWIPES AT HILLARY CLINTON. WHAT SHE NEEDS ARE LYING LESSONS FROM HER HUSBAND WHO IS ONE OF THE GREAT LIARS OF ALL TIME. TO DO IT WITH A SMILE AND CHARM. AND AT DONALD TRUMP. PRESIDENTS DON'T TALK LIKE THIS. THEY NEVER HAVE. THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHEN YOU ARE LIVING IN A BANANA REPUBLIC. HE PRAISED PRESIDENT TRUMP AS WELL. THE GAME FOR HIM WAS PHILOSOPHICAL NOT PARTISAN. HIS CONSERVATISM WAS NEVER ABOUT GETTING REPUBLICANS ELECTED. HE RANGED WIDELY AS A WRITER FROM HIS BELOVED BASEBALL TO A CHEEKY COLUMN CALLED IN DEFENSE OF THE F WORKED. HE DICTATED HIS COLUMNS BECAUSE HE WAS UNABLE TO TYPE BUT RARELY SPOKE OF HIS DISABILITY. YOU ARE BY TRAYING YOUR WHOLE LIFE IF YOU DON'T SAY WHAT YOU THINK AND YOU DON'T SAY IT HONESTLY AND BLUNTLY. CHARLES COULD BE BLUNT, BUT HE WAS NEVER NASTY. A MARKED CONTRAST TO TODAY'S ANGRY OUTRAGE, NAME-CALLING BRAND OF PUNDIT TRI. HE WAS TRAINED AS A MEDICAL DOCTOR BUT HE USED A SCALPEL NOT A SLEDGE HAMMER. IN THAT SENSE, BRET, HE LIFTED EVERYONE'S GAME. Bret: YEAH. HE REALLY DID. HE IS MISSED. HOWIE, THANK YOU. LATER TONIGHT, 9:00 P.M. EASTERN, A SPECIAL HOUR-LONG PRESENTATION ABOUT CHARLES' LIFE IN HIS OWN WORDS. LATER THIS HOUR, WE HAVE A SPECIAL ALL-STAR PANEL LOOKING AT CHARLES' LIFE AND LEGACY. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER WAS 68.
