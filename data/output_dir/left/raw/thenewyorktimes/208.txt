00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,940
Hi, I’m Ben Falcone,
the director

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,620
of “Life of the Party."

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:08,970
So this is the scene where
there’s an ‘80s party.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,195
And we really wanted to get a
nice response of them coming in

5
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:13,830
in a true ‘80s style.

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,550
The costumes, Melissa had
a lot of influence in.

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,640
You can see that our
heroes are "Dynasty,"

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,880
and the other girls
are more aerobics.

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,910
And these costumes,
if you look at them,

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,070
Melissa helped pick them
out and ordered them.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,680
And then our costume
designer, Louise Mingenbach,

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,490
helped add things to them.

13
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,830
But look at their hair.

14
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,530
One thing to note
is that all of them

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,370
needed extra hair to really
‘80s out as much as we are here,

16
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,520
except for Jessie Enis,
who’s the great actress

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,990
in the green dress.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,400
So that’s all her own real hair.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,310
And then we’ve got a Miami Vice.

20
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,970
And then we’ve got — what is
Jimmy O. Yang doing there?

21
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,220
He’s all over the place
‘80s, which actually I think

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,140
hits his character pretty well.

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,977
This scene is a little bit
of a throwback, I hope.

24
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:04,560
And the whole movie, actually,
is a little bit of a throwback,

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,330
because our main
character is a throwback.

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:06,871
Deana, right?

27
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,670
She’s played by Melissa.

28
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,400
She’s the woman.

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,060
She goes back to school
with her own daughter.

30
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,300
And we wanted this
to feel like some

31
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,021
of these comedies from the
‘80s that we love so much.

32
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,520
We also wanted it
to look like film.

33
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,200
Melissa and I really love film.

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,240
And Julio Macat,
our cinematographer,

35
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,750
did a great job with that.

36
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,960
Here, Melissa, here’s a song
she’s about to go dance.

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,870
And she worked so
hard on this dance.

38
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,275
People seemed to
really enjoy it.

39
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:36,290
"I know this one."

40
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,385
"No, Mom."

41
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:38,760
"I know this one!"

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:42,340
Melissa really likes to dance.

43
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:45,360
And she was really nervous
about shooting the scene.

44
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,610
And this was actually a really
technically tricky scene

45
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,110
to shoot.

46
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,950
I hope that the audience can
see the joy that’s in the scene.

47
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,080
But it actually took a
lot of technical elements

48
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,890
from the camera side, and
certainly on Melissa’s side.

49
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,780
And we had a lot of
great dancers there.

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:04,700
Our choreographer, Twitch,
from the Ellen show,

51
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,360
choreographed this
dance with Melissa.

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,210
She practiced on the weekends
and really worked hard

53
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,810
on this dance to make this funny
dance that seems so casual.

54
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,710
She worked on it incredibly
hard for weekends and weekends

55
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,525
on end.

56
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:21,405
[music]

57
00:02:25,757 --> 00:02:26,757
"It's a car!"

58
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:28,195
" Yes, I can see that!"

59
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,670
"Oh, yes, Mom."

60
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,040
"What a woman!"

61
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,000
I guess it’s sort of like
a fight scene, right?

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,930
But it’s a dance fight.

63
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,670
And there’s Debbie Ryan.

64
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,190
She plays that
character who is always

65
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,100
trying to sort of denigrate
someone else, probably

66
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,010
because she feels vulnerable
and not great about herself.

67
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,480
And then Melissa comes in
and does the worm, which

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,010
sort of wins the dance battle.

69
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,266
The worm is not easy.

70
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,640
It’s sort of a
physical training.

71
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,920
I mean, doing the worm —

72
00:03:02,920 --> 00:00:00,000
I can’t do it.
