hey guys um<font color="#CCCCCC"> teles I am almost done as</font>

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,490
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking out my hair I just</font>

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,800
have this little top button to go as a

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,809
right now I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curling it like this</font>

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:14,730
in the front and then have like throwing

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,109
the rest of my hair out so it looks like

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,449
I kind of did like a little purposeful

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,109
bun style thing I've been going to work

9
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,820
like this people think it's cute they

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,970
think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look like a little I don't</font>

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">know African doll or something so that's</font>

12
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">how this is going um but actually wanted</font>

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,140
to pause and answer a question that acts

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,120
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment that someone put on my own</font>

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,469
in my other videos talking about how i'm

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,480
taking my locks out and I thought it's

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,460
just an<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing question and I figure</font>

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,850
this person is either starting locs or

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,620
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting locs or</font>

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,149
something of the like and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just thought</font>

21
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:53,280
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a good question to answer and I</font>

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,500
have it here to my left your right i'm

23
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,750
assuming on my computer screen it's

24
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,890
questions from<font color="#CCCCCC"> vivo puro and it said</font>

25
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,809
would you keep the same size if you

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:06,210
started locks again would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid</font>

27
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,280
products twist gels butters etc the

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,990
second time around and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go on</font>

29
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,330
to congratulate<font color="#CCCCCC"> me for combing the locks</font>

30
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,560
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would do so much differently so</font>

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,710
much differently the second time around

32
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:23,189
first each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my locks would be at</font>

33
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,829
least a pencil with<font color="#E5E5E5"> thickness at least I</font>

34
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:31,049
had a lock had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few locks around my</font>

35
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:34,920
edges<font color="#CCCCCC"> um that were very tiny I would</font>

36
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,020
almost say kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like sister lock tiny</font>

37
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,960
little guy kind of like sister walk tiny

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,600
um very very small and they were so hard

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,840
to take out like sitting there oh my

40
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,750
gosh picking and picking and picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

41
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,380
was so difficult um and it's just not

42
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,939
worth it and I know the only reason I

43
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,649
even had some that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were that size for</font>

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:01,110
just because when i started my locks and

45
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,689
we had about maybe an inch of hair for

46
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,820
the woman<font color="#CCCCCC"> that started them for me to</font>

47
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">use so it's like around the edges it's</font>

48
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,330
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to do with this little</font>

49
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,660
nub<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and so that's why i had</font>

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,110
some

51
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,180
were so tiny it was like all along my

52
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,770
edge here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and around here those were a</font>

53
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:23,220
nightmare so second time around I would

54
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,780
make them at least a pencil width

55
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,940
thickness I'd noticed that once if songs

56
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,640
they were a pencil<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's fine I could</font>

57
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,540
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> him out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> building big deal to as far</font>

58
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">as twisting gels and butters I would</font>

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,500
stay away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them I would not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use them</font>

60
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,020
to maintain my hair at all um when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,170
first started my locks I used a Murphy's

62
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,570
beeswax to maintain them um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

63
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,700
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> big mistake because build up there was</font>

64
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,630
a lot of buildup um just because I was

65
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,100
so under that mindset that I needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

66
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,800
maintain my<font color="#CCCCCC"> locks quickly and my keep</font>

67
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,209
them neat and organized even though I

68
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:07,590
was going through the stubborn phase

69
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,180
where it's like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look a</font>

70
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">little ragged for a little while I just</font>

71
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,290
wasn't used to that yet that you know

72
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,670
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that kind of look and</font>

73
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,560
making it work so i would use beeswax a

74
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,320
lot and it's like it caked into there

75
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,600
and so now like combing them out<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font>

76
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,600
see all of that build up and it's like

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,730
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be I'll comb one out and like I</font>

78
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:32,239
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on my shirt like pieces of it</font>

79
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,739
along with the shag hair and stuff and

80
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,380
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> disgusting like I have a piece here</font>

81
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,430
and I know it's kind of hard to tell

82
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">because this camera is very low quality</font>

83
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,320
but every little clump<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see there is</font>

84
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,959
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just hair</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buildup in that</font>

85
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
clump like it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like white sticky</font>

86
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,780
kind of gunk so each clunk clunk you see

87
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,830
there each little clump is not only a

88
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,890
not but build up stuck in my hair<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,739
that's I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a fraction of</font>

90
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,579
what I have it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> disgusting so second</font>

91
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,298
time around I would just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use water and I</font>

92
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,010
would interlock which was what I

93
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,110
discovered about two and a half years in

94
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,760
to my locker journey before

95
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,070
work was interlocking and it worked so

96
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,260
great for my hair it was just like this

97
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,350
is what my hair is meant to do you know

98
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,850
so second time around that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> number two</font>

99
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,250
um those are like the two really big

100
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,950
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would definitely change</font>

101
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,390
the second time around number three

102
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,360
would be the way I moisturize I would

103
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,640
try to use very very light products and

104
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,390
mainly just oils it mainly be like oils

105
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,750
and water maybe like a water at it

106
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,520
spritz and then I would probably just

107
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,710
you know massage some type of oil

108
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,160
whether it be a tea tree hoba i've been

109
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,140
using apricot oil a lot recently not

110
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,680
only on my skin but<font color="#CCCCCC"> my hair it would be</font>

111
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,420
my parrot my lock maintenance would be

112
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,240
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very basic shame or like if even if</font>

113
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,620
it was shea butter<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd make sure i would</font>

114
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,450
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> use shea butter the thicker things</font>

115
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:25,440
on my ends and like way way down here

116
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,570
like way down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would not use a lot</font>

117
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,920
a little bit goes a long way with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

118
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,860
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to minimize the build-up</font>

119
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,960
because especially as you can see my

120
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,190
hair is very kinky coily and it's

121
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,470
compact you know it's very very compact

122
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,880
and thick<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so build-up is always</font>

123
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,470
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an issue for me I think and</font>

124
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,080
those those are like the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font>

125
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,660
would change on the second time around

126
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,310
if I have a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> time around um as of</font>

127
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,290
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I have as you i said before</font>

128
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,600
I've almost finished and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm</font>

129
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,580
still kind of like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how I</font>

130
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,700
feel about this I don't know um I like

131
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,950
that my hair can finally breathe and if

132
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,720
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else if I do go back to locks</font>

133
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,300
after my three months or up I'm happy

134
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,210
that I at least combed him out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

135
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,680
get all this nastiness out of my head

136
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">and to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fresh with a new set if I</font>

137
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,900
decide to do so but we'll see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

138
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,520
goes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I said I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give myself</font>

139
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,310
three months so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

140
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,970
word and three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> but as a right now</font>

141
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,240
I'm kind of like I miss my locks so

142
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,040
we'll see how it goes I hope this helps

143
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,200
vevo app hero

144
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,180
I hope this answering this helps I just

145
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,710
didn't want to like type it and be like

146
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,130
confined to characters and stuff because

147
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,630
you can only respond so much I suppose I

148
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,510
could have just sent you like a message

149
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,180
instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making a video I just thought</font>

150
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that right now oh well hope this</font>

151
00:06:58,860 --> 00:00:00,000
helps
