DEVELOPMENT.
I'M GOING TO BRING IT UP NOW
WITH MY NEXT GUEST.
BENJAMIN HALL, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
HIS REPORT EXCELLENT THERE.
HARRY, THE DECK TERROR OF THE
DEFENSE STUDIES AT THE STUDY
FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST.
THIS IS TROUBLING.
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE REGIONAL
CONCERNS INTO THE WHOLE VISION
HERE.
WHERE DOES THIS PUT THE UNITED
STATES?
I MEAN OUR PRESIDENT IS STRONG
ON THIS ISSUE.
IF ISRAEL IS IN FURTHER
DANGER, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
>> WELL, HARRIS, I HAVE A GOOD
IDEA THAT THE IRAN DEAL IS
PROBABLY DEAD.
I THINK THE ONLY QUESTION HERE
IS WHAT DATE YOU STAMP ON THE
TOMBSTONE.
I THINK THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN PRETTY
CLEAR FROM REALLY SINCE THE
CAMPAIGN THAT THIS ISN'T A
DEAL THEY LIKE.
IT'S OBVIOUS WHY THEY DON'T
LIKE IT.
IN FACT, BORIS JOHNSON
PROBABLY MADE THE CASE ON "FOX
& FRIENDS" WHY WE SHOULD LEAVE
THE DEAL.
>> Harris: EXACTLY.
>> SUNSET PROVISION, IRAN GETS
TO LEAVE THE DEAL IN 2025.
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND IRAN
IS GOING TO TRY TO RENEGOTIATE
A NEW DEAL THEN.
THEY WILL PROBABLY SPRINT TO
BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR THE
SAME REASONS THE NORTH KOREANS
HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BECAUSE
IT GUARANTEES THEIR SECURITY.
IRANIANS WERE SMART IN THE
DEAL TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE
IS NO RESTRICTION ON ABILITY
FOR THEM TO BUILD MISSILES.
DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT
THE IRANIANS AREN'T GETTING
TECHNOLOGY FROM THE NORTH
KOREANS THEY CAN BUY TO BUILD
ICBMs AND MAKE THEM WITH A
NUCLEAR WEAPON IN THE FUTURE.
ALL OF THIS IS FAKES NEWS AND
FAKE DEBATE THAT THE DEAL IS
DEAD.
>> Harris: YOU KNOW IT'S
INTERESTING BECAUSE I WATCHED
THAT INTERVIEW WITH BORIS
JOHNSON AND I KIND OF HAD A
SIMILAR TAKE-AWAY AS YOU ARE
DESCRIBING THAT HE WAS KIND OF
ENUMERATING WHY WE SHOULD EXIT
THE DEAL.
HARRY D YOU THINK IT'S BEEN
FACTORED IN ALREADY, IN
EUROPE, THAT HEY, THE UNITED
STATES IS GOING TO STEP AWAY
AND THAT IS WHAT I WE HEARD
FROM ROUHANI TODAY?
THAT, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE WOULD
CONSIDER STAYING IN THE DEAL
EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES
EXITS?
>> I THINK SO.
ROUHANI AND THE EUROPEANS
COULD HAVE THEIR OWN SIDE DEAL
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO
REMEMBER, HARRIS, THE UNITED
STATES IS THE ONE WHO REALLY
HAS THE BALL IN ITS COURT.
IF WE DECIDE TO SCRAP THE DEAL
AND WE IMPOSE SANCTIONS ON THE
IRANIANS AGAIN, THE IRANIANS
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HERE.
THERE IS PRESSURE ON THE
ECONOMY.
THEY ARE ALREADY UNDER INTENSE
DOMESTIC PROBLEMS.
THEY HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF
DIFFERENT RIOTS AND CHALLENGES
OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.
IN FACT, THERE IS MORE RIOTS
TODAY IN DIFFERENT PART OF THE
COUNTRY.
PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT WAGES
AND THE ECONOMIC FUTURE.
I THINK IN A LOT OF RESPECTS,
A LOT OF IRANIANS ARE WAKING
UP TO THE FACT THE REGIME IS
NOT KEEPING THE PROMISE IT
MADE IN THE LAST 20, 30, 40
YEARS.
I THINK PEOPLE THERE ARE
STARTING TO WAKE UP.
IRAN HAS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT
WHAT IT IS TRYING TO DO.
>> Harris: IT IS SO
INTERESTING TO HEAR YOU SET A
BAR IN THAT COUNTRY FOR A
DICTATORSHIP.
I EXPECT THE BAR TO BE LOW
ANYWAY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE STAND
ALONG THE ROADWAY SAYING THEY
ARE NOT KEEPING THEIR PROMISES
BUT I HEAR YOU.
CAN'T WE TALK A LITTLE BIT, I
WANT TO GET BACK TO WHAT
BENJAMIN HALL WAS TELLING US
ABOUT A FEW MOMENTS AGO.
IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN AN ALLY
BUT A FRIEND IN ISRAEL HEARS
FROM IRAN WE ARE GETTING READY
TO ATTACK YOU.
ON MAY 12, THERE IS A DEADLINE
THAT THE PRESIDENT MAY
DECERTIFY THE IRAN DEAL.
TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THE
COMPONENT GOES TOGETHER AND
WHAT WE MAY NEED TO DO TO
REASSURE ISRAEL.
>> IF THE IRANIANS THOUGHT
ABOUT ATTACK ISRAELI TERRITORY
IN A KINETIC STRIKE THAT IS
ATTRIBUTED 100% TO IRAN, THAT
WOULD BE NEAR SUICIDE FOR A
LOT OF DIFFERENT REASONS.
FIRST, WHAT THE ISRAELIS WOULD
DO IS SAY WELL, THERE IS NO
RESTRICTIONS ON US ANYMORE
FROM ATTACKING IRAN'S NUCLEAR
PROGRAM AND THEY WOULD
PROBABLY WIPE OUT LARGE
SECTIONS OF IT.
I DON'T THINK IT'S IN THE
IRANIAN'S INTEREST.
A LOT OF TIMES THE IRANIANS
TALK BIG AND THEY HAVE THE
GRAND -- GRANDIOSE VISION OF
WHAT THEY CAN DO BUT THEY ARE
ROGUE STATE.
BUT IT WOULD ACTUALLY OPEN UP
A PANDORA'S BOX FOR THEM AND
ISRAEL WOULD STRIKE
AGGRESSIVELY AND THE UNITED
STATES WOULD PROBABLY BACK
THAT UP AND SELL ISRAEL ALL
THE BEST BUNKER-BUSTING BOMBS
AND THINGS TO DO DAMAGE TO
IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM.
IT WOULD BE A BIG MISTAKE.
>> Harris: I WAS FASCINATED
BY WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT WHY
IRAN MIGHT DO A SIDE DEAL WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES.
IT'S ABOUT SECURITY BUT IT'S
ALSO ABOUT MONEY.
