North and South Korea have started their first official talks in two years the negotiations are taking place in the demilitarized zone between the two countries there have been recent signs of progress January the 3rd saw the reopening of a cross-border telephone line and the following day Donald Trump delayed the annual military drills with Seoul until after next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea let's cross now to our reporter caleb more people caleb and what more can you tell us about these talks between North and South Korea well the talks have already started in the shared village in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea now from what we understand the primary focus of the talks will be in relation to the Olympics about the participation of athletes from North Korea in the South Korean Olympic Games which are coming up in February now we also heard from South Korea's reunification minister and he was saying that he hoped the talks could go beyond that and it could be a place for easing the tension between the two countries and the tension on the Korean Peninsula that the whole world has been closely paying attention to over the last few weeks and few months let's take a look kind of an overview of what's been going on on the Korean Peninsula recently now the administration in South Korea actually jumped at the opportunity to have talks now unlike their predecessors the moon administration is always a said that it's very open to a diplomatic solution and a diplomatic approach with North Korea now the the talks actually come in the aftermath of an announcement and a statement in Kim jong-un's New Year's remarks in which she said in his remarks that he was open to having a dialogue with the south this is what we heard from the leader of North Korea once if the south really wants reconciliation in unity we will keep open the doors for talks contact in exchange to everyone including the South Korean administration opposition parties groups from various fields and classes and individuals now when it was announced that the talks were going to take place we heard first on Twitter and then in comments and speeches to the press that we heard from Donald Trump and he says that he thinks it was his approach in dealing with North Korea in the last year of his administration that was responsible for the fact that the talks are taking place this is Donald Trump explaining what he thinks caused the talks a lot of people have said a lot of people have written that without my rhetoric and without my tough stance and it's not just a stance I mean this is this is what has to be done if it has to be done that they wouldn't be talking about Olympics that they wouldn't be talking right now the era of strategic patience with the North Korean regime has failed United States is prepared to use the full range of our capabilities to defend ourselves and our allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea little rocket man rocket fuel for the American economy is a sick puppy now it's certainly interesting that if Donald Trump is responsible for this taking place that unlike previous dialogues that have gone on in the past the United States is not going to have a seat at the table it is only the Korea's North and South Korea that will be engaging in this dialogue that is taking place this dialogue that's taking place at this very moment and furthermore the press is not permitted to be there there is no journalists presence inside the reunification village it's not there there's no press there it's only a five person delegation from North Korea the representatives from South Korea they're the only ones in the room there is no media they're you know covering the events so all eyes are on the Korean Peninsula and in particular on the Dillion Demilitarized Zone where these talks are taking place is as the world prepares for the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in which these talks seem to be focused but many are hoping it will lead to other issues as well and the resolution of tensions on the Korean Peninsula let's see what's going to come from this Kalib more pins thank you very much indeed thank you well some more insight on this story we can now bring in surah Gupta who's an easy person specific an Asia Pacific specialist which takes a lot it was probably easier to do than say so thank you very much indeed for joining us here I mean do you expect any breakthrough at these talks between North and South Korea it'll be a gradual process but I think there will be a breakthrough definitely with regard to Olympic participation that is the low-hanging fruit and I think it can be achieved well Donald Trump has claimed credit for the talks saying if I weren't involved they were doing no talking or it'd be much more serious I mean do you think he's right no I don't think he's certain he is not correct the credit for this actually should go to the new South Korean administration of president moon jae-in what Kim jong-un spoke in his New Year's message was in fact a reply to a speech made by president moon jae-in in Berlin in early July where he laid out points on which they could be conciliation with South Korea Kim jong-un has responded on each of those points which moon jae-in had put out on reducing tensions on the military demarcation line in terms of participation in Olympics starting exchange particularly family reunions etc etc so the credit should go to that I mean perversely Donald Trump should get some credit in terms of North Korea accelerating its nuclear and ballistic missile deterrent so that it now feels that it is reasonably a show that it has that deterrent and can now open talks so from a perverse perspective yes Donald Trump does get some credit and perhaps we should be a little more generous in saying that he has acknowledged that moon jaein can take a leading role in doing in trying to find in in trying to pursue inter-korean reconciliation and for that I think there is some credit that Donald Trump can take but this is primarily our president moon who deserves the credit well as we heard from Caleb there I mean unlike previous talks between the two Koreas the US will not be at the table despite what we say about Donald Trump I mean how could this affect the process what it can do and what it can helpfully do is that if there's progress in these try in these talks slowly gradually over a period of time it then paints the u.s. as the only belligerent and hostile force which is seeking belligerent means in resolving the issue and that will force the u.s. to do a recalculation of its policy on North Korea and try to see how it can also facilitate more peaceful solutions rather than just hawkish solutions so from that perspective it can be useful but we must also remember in mind that there's only so far that South and North Korea can go and it is essential that during the spirit North Korea does not take any belligerent actions the head of the North Korean delegation said that successful talks would be the perfect New Year's gift I mean what do you think North Korea specifically is hoping to get out of these negotiations I think North Korea is really genuinely seeking it seeking to play the conciliation card if one reads our president Kim Kim Chairman Kim jong-un speech on New Year's Day a good third of that each was devoted to reconciliation with the South the tune was very respectful and conciliatory so if North Korea feels that it is at a point where it is sufficiently assured with its deterrent capability it wants to see how far it can pursue conciliation with the South yes one can one can never be sure and so it might be he's just seeking a pause from during which time he can do technological advancements etc etc he might be trying to draw put a wedge between the u.s. and ROK but all these things can only be tested once once once we actually go ahead and allow this process to take take shape and then we will know who stands where and at this point of time let's take it in good faith and try to see if we can lower temperatures on the peninsula and get a and and deflect the peninsula from the from the fairly awful trajectory on which it has been moving towards for the last past one year time to be positive then so I've got to Asia Pacific strategist and economic policy specialists there and you I get it right in the end thank you very much indeed for your thoughts thank you
