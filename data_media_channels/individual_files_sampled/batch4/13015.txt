of my families made up for me me and the unstable non Sunday mornings I got to drink a coffee out of a non stay boy non genius or unstable non genes so you're gonna have to send me one of those that sounds almost as good as the leftist here's tumblr that's and there are a lot of leftist tears pouring out today by the way I'm super jealous of you by the way I mean the fact that I've written three books and haven't been able to sell one book other than the ones that I bought myself of course my basement in the basement you're writing about nothing and selling hundreds of thousands of books well your you might be an unstable non genius I am a non writing author so there's a lot of inversion that goes on in these in these great skills we were having breakfast when this memo stuff broke yeah we were having breakfast when the news broke Andrew McCabe confirmed that no FISA warrant would have been sought without the steal dossier information which was ordered and paid for by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democrat Party is there a conspiracy at the FBI and other agencies to take down Donald Trump again I'm not sure I'm not a conspiracy person myself so I'm not gonna say that there's a conspiracy but if you if you think about the events today you have to ask yourself with the right protocols and checks and balances are in place in these situations to make sure that the politicization I said that properly of a agency that is supposed to be as non-political as possible to ensure the integrity of our system and our political system and our legal system oh boy I think they've got to probably tighten that up a lot and this was the president was exonerated today on a lot of things that he'd be saying back in March Michael which you know that's absolutely right he was exonerated people were spewing fake news I know you know we talked of CNN is already trying to spin this thing they're saying it's a Republican memo it's this or that they're so frustrated that their lies and called out if President Trump observed this he said top officials at the FBI and DOJ politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans do you think that means if he's exonerated today that it's time to fire Muller that's time to end this investigation again I I don't know I mean I'm not inside the White House anymore and I'm not part of those strategy sessions but Mike tells me would be a bad move to fire Mahler primarily because what ends up happening the error and if you not not to bore your listeners or viewers with history but when they fired Archibald Cox on the on that great Saturday evening massacre I think that point the administration into a tailspin I think they completely lost their footing I think the president's I'm pretty strong footing right now I saw reports this morning that he's got a forty nine percent approval rating post State of the Union address I thought was a spectacular from the State of the Union address and so he's got a lot of things going his way momentum wise the economy the right policies on the economy the right policies for the middle class and lower middle class families and so all of that together in the soup I would say don't fire Muller I believe that there's absolutely no collusion there I know the President believes that no collusion with Russia right now what they will say well did the Russians interfere in the election okay Mike Pompeo says that they did I'll take the CIA director at his word he's a high integrity guy I never met with many of our life that's my point they probably interfered with our elections for as long as they have been in existence so that's probably 1917 to today unfortunately that's the world that we live in but to say that the Republican Party's candidate colluded with the Russians I don't believe that I was there I you know I was there for eleven days in the White House but I was there for 18 months on the campaign as a member of the executive transition team and I didn't see anything like that and so I'm pretty confident more than how they comment the president will be exonerated but here's the issue we're in a very highly polarized society the president's been right about a lot of things and stylistically his adversaries don't like him and so he fires Muller bill that will be a touch and firestorm that he doesn't need right now the momentum is his friend I would leave the guy alone that's right because it would also distract from the cycle of we have evidence Democrats and Barack Obama's government acted improperly why overshadow that news cycle and throw yourself and expose yourself tomorrow I don't lose anything any need to do that and I don't Robert Muller personally but the president also said the New York Times a few weeks ago maybe a month ago did he expect him to treat him fairly the people that know Robert Muller personally think he is a fair and judicious person I think that what happened today is relates to the memo will probably make him even more cautious yeah and more judicious in terms of treating this matter before the president so by large it was a good day for America because what we have to do is we have to get back to what the Daily wire wants what you want personally what I want personally and what's in the Federalist Papers we got to get back to the government serving the people and the government not losing sight of that where they think that the people are really serving them well we've been gradually flipping that as we've become more of a status Society and we need to return it back to the individuals and certainly the president and his administration we're trying to do that I remember I had the privilege of meeting with Justice Scalia before he died and he said that the greatest threat to Liberty in the Republic are these overwhelming unaccountable agencies out of the executive branch that don't have a lot of oversight that govern as they will without democratic checks tom Fitton of Judicial Watch said quote you had Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS fusion fusion GPS to create a dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama administration to convince a court misleadingly by all accounts to spy on Trump on the Trump team President Trump tweeted out that quote do people need to go to jail for this and will they I don't know they they might but but here's what I would say and again I don't like even during the campaign I never attacked Secretary Clinton personally I never attacked President Obama personally I really just wanted to talk about the policies but I do think it's fair to talk about the facts okay and if you go back to July of 2016 it was discovered that Debra Wasserman Schultz and secretary Clinton's team did certain things to manipulate the process and manipulate senator Bernie Sanders out of the process okay and that probably cost through the election because Millennials that wanted to support him they didn't cross over as aggressively to support her once she got the nomination they thought the system was rigged then Donna Brazile who's gonna be joining me tonight on the Bill Maher show on HBO basically wrote a book about this and so there are facts here where these people like to take the P under the shell and they like hiding it from the American people and so so you have to be very very worried about that but there's a there's an assent for power there's a quest or a lust for power where people think they can curve the rules to get power to bend towards them right oh and that's very unamerican and so so I'm not saying anybody has to go to jail but it does seem like the processes that are put in place and these agencies need to be tightened yeah that's right it's a good analogy the shell game of people just like from Coney Island or something that's what you're seeing at these agencies along it's just really unfair because because you're relying on the integrity of this system the United States has so many valuable assets we have our great people all the great human capital we have the great resources of the nation the fact that we're we become so powerful because we're basically an island continent we were protected for hundreds of years from these big oceans all of this great stuff but the number one thing that we have and this is what Justice Scalia would say and I I knew him reasonably well is that we have a system that we put in place that checks power the balance of power written into the Constitution the the the the judicial branch legislative branch and the executive power each are checking each other subordinates individuals to the law it's what Cicero once said 2200 years ago that we are slaves to the law on order to be free and if you think about the foundational principles of the country we put ourselves in that position and so you don't like seeing people subverting that for their own personal gain tear the whole edifice down if it can because because you know Reagan said and I was probably 22 at the time that he said it so it's 32 years ago Reagan said that you're always 25 years away from potentially losing your democracy if you don't in bold and power and educate the youth you don't explain to them the beauty of the system that they're living in certainly the system has flaws but it is the best system Churchill once said about democracy is that it it's a horrific form of government until you consider all the other forms except for all the other ones we've ever tried and and so he's right and this is a very very precious thing that we have and so we've got to check people that are in power and these agencies unfortunately because they don't have they're not part of the orbit of that check and balance system sometimes things can go go awry they're a little extra constitutional they seem to subvert a lot of the constitutional order that we that has ruled the country first they have yeah by and large been extremely helpful I mean I'm not ever gonna you're never gonna see me who lived in New York during 9/11 rail on the FBI or their grill and our counterterrorism units I'm not gonna do anything like that I think the president's tweet more or less spoke for himself he knows that the rank and file are very solid that's right but he's just saying that these processes that were put in place particularly if that that steele memo or whatever that was that oppositional research led to all of that banana's stuff that was happening that was actually very unfair to the system and so listen we got to come up with a better way to organize ourselves so that doesn't happen again I've talked to other administration officials they say the the damn shame about this is that because of the political appointees of these agencies the Obama era appointees of these agencies all of the good agents at the FBI or DOJ they're being unfairly marred even though they're good agents it's these political appointees that have acted inappropriately and used the government for political purposes well I mean listen so it'll change I mean here's the greatest thing about our country we've had to heal ourselves many times we healed ourselves after the Civil War we held ourselves after the Great Depression we've healed ourselves after the Watergate situation and so what we'll do is we'll come together and hear all ourselves we got a lot of great things that are happening right now today they printed a 2.9 percent wage increase so middle class wages and lower middle class wages are going up first time in nine years this is the first time since the Great Recession I got trained as an economist I can tell you that our 2006 wages have still not reached that high-water mark and we're 12 years out from there and so we've got to get these families back on the grid I don't know if you saw the manufacturing data we've had a huge manufacturing surge we're manufacturing now at the level that we were in 2004 before we went into that great slippage and so these are super positive things for the country what happened yesterday is the tax plan went into effect and so there's more disposable income for each American it's not crumbs $2,000 is a meaningful amount of money in somebody's pocket if they're making $50,000 a year and so hopefully that will go towards investment savings fortifying their family's lifestyle all these things are super positive and so we should try to focus on the positives write in and hand check and correct as we've always done in this nation when something is going wrong we got to correct it but what I what I would say to my adversary is my political adversaries both inside my own party and my adversaries outside the party is that we should have an unconditional love for this country and stop right there and we're all part of the same family and so let's knit ourselves back together and get this stuff right because the American people are really hungry for that and what do you think so there's a lot of fake news that isn't reporting any of these important statistics and important things have happened in the country you yourself have been the victim of some fake news CN n ran a total hit job on you and they lost three reporters because of it they even had to admit it who do you think when you look around the political observers right now we're looking at this Trump administration this Trump moment who we're offering the best analysis analysis where you could rely on and say okay this is where the administration is going this is where the country is going prison companies yeah I'll give you guys out huge probably you guys do an amazing job you're really trying to get to the truth you know very close to Sean Hannity I do think that there are people at CNN MSNBC and other news outlets individuals inside there that are fairly objective that are trying to do the right thing you know what I don't like it are these labels okay so if you're at CNN you're automatically a trump aider and you're automatically super liberal there are pockets of people in there Jason Miller as an example as a paid contributor to CNN he was the communications director there's a little bit of he was communications director for one day I was the communications director for 11 days you know we're close personal friends he's very Pro Trump so so you have pockets of people in these places that are actually trying to be objective trying to do do a good job in it when I say be objective I'm saying they're Pro Trump people say okay well he's not obviously being subjective I don't mean it that way I mean like let's look for the truth let's try to focus on policies that are gonna help the American people common-sense policies let's not overly politicize the situation and I think there are people that doing that you you brought up CNN I actually have a pretty good relationship with CNN and Jeff Zucker and some of the news anchors there even the news anchors that don't share my political view whether it's a Jake Tapper or a Chris Cuomo but I what I will say though is that the story that they wrote about me was singly source they had one person do you know the source was uh you know I don't obviously you know you know I have an inkling of who I think it may have been but here's the problem with all this stuff these sources are all anonymous they they leak like sibs this is a business practice inside the swamp that people do you know some of the people are sore at me because I speak my mind and I put myself on the record and actually declare what I think of people they're doing the same thing to me except the problem is yeah they're doing it off the records or doing it through cutouts or doing it through all of these like backstabbing Shiva Sh sort of ways of doing things and I know your generation the millennial generation is sort of tired of this nonsense you know they don't they don't like it it's not serving anybody to do that it's not beneficial to the country and so what I'd rather do is as an entrepreneurs let's disrupt let's hack the communications model if you're gonna hit me for 13 straight months and think I don't know that you're the guy hitting me you know it's a joke okay so but I'll hit you back and I'll hit you back directly okay and maybe we can get it to stop maybe we can get you to knock it off but what I'm not gonna do is just sit there and take it so in the CNN case I told those three guys don't write the story it's completely untrue I've got a deep enough pocket where if you write the story there's gonna be there's gonna be a big commotion about it I'm not the typical political operative it's probably why I got fired so quickly because I didn't handle the situation the way a political operative would I handled it the way a business executive would or an entrepreneur why would a political operative handle it differently only the man wastes liquor they would have been as surreptitious as the other people they would have done the whole howdy doody you know Richie Cunningham thing golly gee - everybody's face and then they would have operated behind the scenes you know I did what a business executive would do it's okay here's what we're doing we got to change the culture for some bad actors here the first you got to do and yet bad actors and the cultures you got to ask them to stop it and you got to identify immediately the ones that think you're kidding you got to remove those people from the field and then by and large other people start to Mel to gether okay so in the process of doing that and I was handling it too aggressively these are miming listen I've made probably 10 phone books of mistakes in my life but probably five phone books and mistakes over those 11 days right I was just handling it too aggressively do you think because there's something very refreshing about Donald Trump Donald Trump comes in he's very aggressive he doesn't beat around the bush he doesn't do in that Vanity Fair interview which is very entertaining and interesting interviewer you refer to Reince Priebus as a Howdy Doody or Richie Cunningham Donald Trump doesn't do that so it served him well do you not why didn't it serve you well I'm not the president you know I was his comms director I needed to be a little bit more depth I needed to be a little bit more subtle I needed to be less aggressive I probably should have taken the president's marching orders less seriously less clinically and you know listen I mean at the end of the day I've made it a lot of mistakes I had I owned them I apologized for them and I've moved on but what I'm not gonna do is break ranks with the president because he's he's a good man he's doing a very good job stylistically at times he would probably be better served if he dialed into a different style once in a while but at the end of the day his report card his record is gonna speak for itself we've got a Super Bowl coming up this weekend Bill Parcells who whose Protege Bill Belichick is arguably one of the best coaches in NFL history these guys have a great line my record is my record I'll let my record say whether or not I'm a good NFL coach or not and I think that's how the president feels about his presidency right now he's not just an unbelievable first-year you just look at the data the most conservative first-year modern and recognize from national security context labor regulations in the board regulations on different businesses he's allowed disappointments judicial appointments he's allowed these businesses to grow and prosper he set an agenda that's pro-business friendly which will lead to wage growth the tax cut is having this unbelievable consequence that I don't think anybody truly expected secretary minuchin and secretary Ross said last week in Davos that they didn't expect the magnitude of the businesses large and small that we're offering up higher bonus payouts higher minimum wages more capital investments this is all a result of making America's tax rate more competitive so what are we learning from the president policy matters we're learning from the president that he said before the State of the Union that his heart and soul is in the thing and he realizes as president as a politician is to be way more compassionate because there are millions of people's lives that are at stake in terms of where the decisions are being made so just think about what he did with the taxes millions upon millions of people around the world have benefited from but CNN told me everyone's taxes were going up every mall the news media in New York told some taxes are go some some of that's actually a you know look my taxes went up I'm gonna clean my taxes whenever I'm in a blue state and so the deduction the lack of deductibility was not offset by the decrease in federal marginal tax rate eighty percent of americans get it but yeah but the more important thing is it wasn't designed for you or me necessarily it was really designed for frankly the people that I grew up with to give them more disposable income in their pockets and so I think it by Lord's been gonna be a resounding success absolutely and just the corporate cut that alone and make it a great rating Michaels making the country more competitive obviously and you see it even the IMF admits that do you think that the president is being served by his team I think you get credit for knocking out some of his advisers who might not have been serving him very well when you left do you think he's being served by his team now were the good guys who were the bad guys well listen I mean III do I think general Kelley is done a good job he's uh he seems again from a distance I don't I don't I don't talk to general Kelly but it seems like they're very well organized it seems like they have they've got a good message I think they're gonna come out with a solution on the daca situation then they're gonna turn their focus to health care I think that the the team that I know some of them there so they're from the campaign whether it's Jared or Ivanka or somebody like Kelly and Conway I know they love the president or trimming loyal to him they're great messengers for the president there was an article today which I share with a lot of my friends about the successes that Jared is already having in the Middle East in terms of the design and implementation of that strategy and the eventual unveil meant of the Middle East peace process I think it'll be unique it'll be a lot it'll be disruptive like so many things that the president's willing to do that other politicians frankly weren't willing to do I remember earlier on in the administration some of president Trump's former advisors say Steve Bannon for instance was reported widely to be criticizing Jared Kushner criticizing Ivanka has the president made a decision on which way his administration and his staffing is gonna go yeah well obviously I mean listen I mean here's the problem with all that like he was trying to split the administration between globalists and nationalists and and Steve is also this guy that was trying to go for 120 percent of something where you know the Ronald Reagan aphorism is you got to go for 80 percent of something and hope that you can get that and reach a compromise with the other side because that's the way the founders put the system in place so that sort of divisive nough stat unnecessary leaking that in turn s and warfare the dropping of people's personal wise and the innuendo and all of that stupid nonsense that was going on inside the White House that's certainly down and so I think you know I give a lot of credit the general Kelly and for the president going in that direction do you think that we talked about the tweeting when he goes he Street tweets these things and it's brash and I really like it I think it really leads the media all around a lot of people especially on the right has critics on the right say he needs to stop the tweeting go go into a closet somewhere don't tweet just keep doing what you're doing but stuff I do you think tweeting help summer at her no I I think if the if the people that want him to stop the tweeting got on television and said I want you to treat more please send out more tweets and send out incessant tweets maybe then he wouldíve enough maybe I'll put the phone back in my pocket right so I have found even on the campaign was it stopped the tweeting the president will gonna shake his head because he would say listen you're not seeing what I'm seeing and what he was seeing and you have to accept that this is true some presidential historian will write this about him you got to think about the use of social media by a seven-year-old man okay he the most culturally tuned in I've got to give him credit right and he's also great you got to think about though his idioms and the way messages to people there's always a little bit of a twist he's the Frank Sinatra of tweeting okay and now you're not old enough to remember Frank but I listened to a lot of Frank but Frank had a personality that he added to his music he was always on key but you could always find him a little slippage with the words or he throw in an extra word that wasn't necessarily in the lyrics and he would do certain things that added his charisma and Verve to the song and so the President does that he's the Frank Sinatra of tweeting you can always tell for all we know he might be running pharaoh's father we don't know who knows he's definitely not Ronan Farrell's well I'll take the over on that one but but what I would say to you about about him is that what he's tweeting you know it's his tweets I think he could bees at times more strategic you know I I if I was sitting there with him I would say listen let your advocates let your surrogates excuse me both inside the White House and outside the White House do the job of defending you against some of the nonsense you don't have to write about people's facelifts you don't have to write about people's personalities let your media surrogates do that focus on policy focus on things that you want to get out there focus on trying to bring the Democrats together on a dock a deal things like that um but you know listen he's not gonna he's not gonna listen to anybody on that he's got great media instincts he went from zero to the American presidency in 17 months no one in the history United State has ever done that it's the toughest job it's the most powerful job in the world and there were a lot of qualified people in 2016 that wanted that job and he slayed every single one this is my question I might not be old enough to remember Frank Sinatra but I am old enough to remember the time when the billionaire who took over New York real estate and casinos and television and branding and then won the highest job in the world on his first go at politics defeated 16 of the best politicians in the country then took down as a Clinton I'm old enough to remember the time when people thought he might be somewhat intelligent I'm that's how old I am do you is is the President as he says like a very stable genius well I mean look I mean like I said I mean of course he's like a very stable gene I mean this the funny stuff about that when he's writing that you can almost see the smirk ich frog face that he makes while he's writing it because he knows it's gonna set the hair on fire for all these liberals you know but I'm gonna tell you something about the president okay I am old enough to remember when dr. Martin Luther King's holiday which was signed into law by President Reagan wasn't appropriately honored with the same respect as other federal ''tis I'm old enough to remember when I was a young guy on Wall Street probably your age where Donald J Trump and a group of leading New York businessmen entrepreneurs and Wall Street executives lobbied the New York Stock Exchange with the rainbow coalition which was led by the Reverend Jesse Jackson to get the stock exchange to close on Martin Luther King's birthday and and people don't want to give any credit for that because if you greatest but you can find that on the internet you can find the Reverend Jesse Jackson saying great things about his personality and you can you can find that he's actually racially blind he's colorblind he's a guy that really wants people to do well and he's been a winner his whole life you know I I you know we're talking you're talking about the Bill Cohen article this guy is like a Michael Jordan he can he's not a choke artist he will hit the shot I took a lot of flack on that when they in the press conference I said because I've seen him do it okay and by the way he hit the shot on the presidency a lot of guys couldn't do that on his first try on his first official try on his first try that speaking of the smirk by the way going back to seeing the smirk when Donald Trump is tweeting them Ryan Lizza ended your career at the White House you had a phone call with Ryan Lizza from the New Yorker yeah I ended the maybe I I made the mistake of trusting him so I have to take personal responsibility for that but he participated in it at least and then a few months later he was booted he was fired from his job for allegations of sexual misconduct did it take a crowbar to pry the grin from your face when that occurred hey let me tell you something you know I'm a human being and so my reaction to his firing was okay great he's not gonna be able to do to other human beings what he did to me there's a very malicious very nefarious very evil doer I don't know what he did at The New Yorker to get himself fired but I know what he did to me so I know what the personality type is the reason why I'm a big believer in karma is that you know something bad could happen to you from a person like him and you say oh well someday he'll get his and the answer is of course he will because the nefarious action that he perpetrated on me he's gonna eventually cross the line farther enough or further enough where he gets smacked back and so I'm I'm glad he lost his job and it's not like I'm taking this like shot and Freud a pleasure in it because what he did to me was unconscionable how he kurtz from media buzz said that his act towards me he never seen anything like that in the 40 years that he's been in Washington a journalist that would actually do that to a White House official chief it was some heavy well as you know President Obama said say that you know they cut one of his middle fingers off and therefore they muted his expertise but Rob was known to be a profane guy right behind the scenes President to have the table with steak knives with President President Obama himself many others if you think in your audience thinks I'm the only person in the West Wing that's had a little bit of a potty mouth from time to time you know then you guys are not on the same planet that I'm living of course so what he did to me and the way he wrote the story and if you listen to the tape versus the story I'm literally having a conversation with him like I'm having it with you except it's a little bit more neighborly his father knew my dad for 50 years yeah he said well he said in the story that I'm lying about that that's not that's you know I you can interview my folks they know the Lizza family forever he is right about the fact that we didn't know each other super well we had met on the set of CNN he is right at it but we were building a rapport with each other and when I called him that night I didn't think he would do that to me but I am at that point in my life the White House communications director and I shouldn't be trusting journalists like him or anybody for that matter no matter what their last names are what they're connected or my family or my neighborhood I had to own that and so I take personal responsibility for it but here's the learning lesson for younger people that are probably plugged into your program own it but don't let it be a millstone on your neck for the rest of your life just move on just people you have to always do in your life is forgive yourself and drop the Millstone don't live your life with regret don't live in the past focus on the present and the future and just make yourself better every day this gets to a point on a personal question you graduated from Harvard Law School you worked at Goldman Sachs you founded two financial services companies you turn them into big successes yet in the public eye you are the mooch you are the zany profane New Yorker that Ryan Lizza writes about yeah same with Donald Trump Donald Trump graduated from Wharton he had massive professional success he rose to the highest level in the land and yet in the public eyes he's this cartoon character Donald Trump tweeting cough fa ha is there a political advantage to playing a little bit dumber or a little bit crazier than your mark yeah well I mean there isn't there isn't I mean I think what they try to do and they're sometimes successful and they've been less successful with the president for a reason because of his persistence and his resilience but the move the playbook move is too cartoonish cartoon of five people especially for Republican yeah to dimensionalize them call them racists I mean that's like boom here until you're autumn you're an auto racist Jesse Jackson loves you you campaign for Martin Luther King Day on the stock exchange but you become a Republican than you're racist you're a racist but but the point is is that like if if I have a voice that's credible and I did go to the Harvard Law School and I'm reasonably well-read and have a pretty good idea about where the zeitgeist is going at what policies make sense for the country right at the end of the day you really got to know me less focus on left and right and I'm more focused on right or wrong like what's actually the right thing for the country I'm a libertarian by nature more than I am a conservative and so you asked me about the marriage equality movement I honestly do not care who marries who and so for 15 years I've been a gay rights activist the Liberals will not give me any credit for that of course because I've sided with the President on so many issues and so so I'm really an eclectic bag politically okay I'm not really purely Streak politically I'd rather like I said focus on what's right or wrong as opposed to left or right and I can also back it up with a lot of content that is a disaster for an adversary because if I'm doing that that doesn't work you've got to tell me that I'm the situation gym tan laundry right that's what I think Seth Meyers called me a human pinky ring you've got to say that I'm a gangsta from New York that is that is slightly offensive I mean you know I'm a guy I remember from MSNBC said I was like a studio gangster or staged gangster and I said look I'm an italian-american you know that's like really offensive I don't know imagine if they said that about any other ethnic group imagine if they said it's it's crazy but you know what let me tell you something you're a fellow Italian or you're half Italian yeah you can't bring it up because you get no backup no we're good no one's gonna back you up it's okay to put The Sopranos out there and the Godfather on for sure and you brought up Justice Scalia and what Scalia would tell you that he's a big believer in the First Amendment as am i I don't care I own my heritage and I don't care about it but what I won't do is sit in the shame box that my adversaries have built for me what I won't do is allow them to contextualize me the way they're trying to I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna come on your show I'm gonna go on Bill Maher show tonight I'm gonna be with Chris Cuomo boxing with them in the freezing Fredo Elmo is what we call him here at the Daily wire but sure is your friend I'm really afraid of Cuomo he'll get up to get upset about that but but but you know listen and he has an ideological view that's very different from mine you grew up in a Democratic family I grew up in a Republican family we see the world differently of course my view in your view is the right view wrong right but my point is we can disagree and still be somewhat agreeable with each other this whole nonsense where the president's delivering the results and nobody can stand and clap and everyone's gonna have a you know scowl on their faces you know it was like a you know I was calling it democratic detox instead of Botox right de for Democrat they were all had the same plastic like look on their faces hey you know get over yourselves okay they're doing that for the cameras they're voting for the cameras so that their base will say okay yeah yeah yeah be part of the resistance resist this guy they did this to Reagan and they did it to Reagan even conservatives did it to Reagan and the way conservatives are doing it to Trump they did it to Reagan early part of his of his terms as he was delivering the result and they started to realize the kind of guy that it really was it was very hard to hit him as much as they did but Reagan made a very big gaffe before one of his televised speeches where he was joking around and he leaned into the microphone he said we begin bombing I've outlawed russia forever yeah and we begin bombing in five minutes and so everyone went crazy it was very trumpian frankly you know oh he's this he's that there were protesters and all this other stuff but he was a peace-loving man you know he loved his family loved his country to abolish nuclear what's great great writer um they didn't give any credit for his writing skills uh Reagan in his own words if you have an interest in that book it was one moment okay I'm gonna book about his personality and when you when you think about the President or our current president he just has a lot of common sense he's got a lot of wisdom but he's a tough brawler aggressive sort of a guy and he's doing a great job and I particular what the one observation the one nice thing that I will say about Fredo on this program Chris Cuomo your friend is the only time I can watch Chris Cuomo is when you are on his show and you guys are fun it is some of the best TV that is out there it is the only time I watched yeah I mean I have I was a little bit too crazy from Davos at four o'clock in the morning yeah listen I mean we get along though I mean at the end of the day um I do disagree with him on the memo that just came out and I do disagree with everything else you know and I and I tweeted out earlier today you can go on my Twitter feed where you can see I'm being interviewed by him in March president saying that's been wiretapping going on now Chris will parse that he'll say well he said specifically it was him and Trump Tower okay I understand that but it's Twitter it's 140 characters what he's hours a metonym for the campaign that's my if that's that's the point he's really just trying to say more broadly that there was some nefarious activity or a lack of a proper procedures in place that led to some politicized observation of people that were involved in his campaign and so listen we can debate about whether it's right we can debate about whether it's wrong but it doesn't seem right and if I were the Democrats and I was a Democratic strategist I would actually get out there and say you know what let's stop politicizing this it just doesn't seem right okay they would have so much more credibility go back to July of 2016 you should have gotten out there and said you know we we we cheated or Bernie Sanders out of it he deserved a fair chance than he got and all of a sudden what happens is you're creating a restoration of trust with people where you're being that bold face in terms of your honesty and so they're never gonna do it by the way these operatives on the Republican side are not gonna do it you know they're gonna do opposition research I mean I was on wall street for 29 years and I'm Italian I mean Reince Priebus thought I had to have done something wrong Reince Priebus took us Apple files on you 100% 100% Oppo files on the company that bought my company that was his personality he was very proud of that he was very very separate issues in terms of the way he did it um and so I called him out on it I and I at the anything I'm not a politician so you went up to because the Washington way to do it is to smile and say oh yeah so that's nice Ryan see you for drinks later yeah yeah no I call them right out on it and that's the other thing people say oh well you know you were on the phone Ryan Lizza saying nasty things about these guys and you didn't have the courage to say to their faces that's totally not true of course I said it to their faces you know but but at the end of the day if saying it to their faces and I've taken some flak for saying it to their faces but if saying it to their faces causes a communication disruption where the American people really start to understand how these swamp creatures act yeah maybe the shaming of that will put some of that to rest and people can start to subordinate themselves to the good of the American people actually serve the American people and so so I'm hopeful I'm hoping that will happen two final quick questions if we have time there was a lot of North Korea talk in that State of the Union it was an excellent speech a ji Seon ho a North Korean defector was invited only god can judge but Donald Trump can arrange the meeting is a little Rocketman long for this world I don't know I my my guess is is that I like the facts that are available to me today you know I had some better insight when I was in the White House but the facts that are available to me today is that the North Korean leadership is talking to the South Korean leadership and they've agreed to march together in the Olympics and they're gonna march under a unified flag and so I take that as a very strong positive I think that moon basically said that it was president Trump's nature and president Trump's conference decisiveness and his pushing that got the two sides together and so I do think that that's a breakthrough that really hasn't happened over the last quarter century they haven't communicated period it's fun to watch people not want to give the president credit for that and I understand why because some of the stuff that he does is quote unquote non-presidential but a lot of the stuff that he does is quite principled right and so I do think if you're asking me to make a prediction and that's a terrible thing to do because you always predict things that are wrong you know the good thing about political predictions though you can predict anything and you'll be wrong all the time and then people still do that you mean you swipe the Florida dollar check from Benton I know we're very one of the highlights of my professional career very proud of that you know that was a prediction of what your way thank God but but I do think that there will be a de-escalation there because it's in the best interest of everybody I'll say the same thing about Kim L on that you were saying about me or a Donald Trump he's getting caricature iced and he's getting to dimensionalized as a cartoon villain which is amazing maybe the obese guy but he is being a true to me yes but he may be absolutely ruthless he may be a horrific in terms of his morals and his scruples but I don't think he's dumb and I think he's a pretty calculating person because he has survived as a young man in that power structure after his father died and so my prediction is he's a rationalist and he wants to survive he wants that regime to survive in some form the Hermit Kingdom and so my prediction is it will work itself out over - won't he won't push it so hard that we're gonna take him out he won't but his button is probably smaller than the magnets but I think that goes to that saying that one on his I believe one of my Marshall can I get a button on my dad's another funny comment from the president you know I mean you got me yeah I love the button comment final question went how does the smaller thing and you know in Washington or in New York for that matter you could indict a ham sandwich it's very very easy to do it it seems like Muller has to get somebody's scalp you can't just let this thing completely go that who gets indicted how far up does this go you know you were talking about this earlier I do think that the issue now is going to make people doubly and Triple E more careful about the situation I think I think so so I mean look I predict a positive outcome I'll go back to what the president said to the New York Times reporter I think that at mar-a-lago where he expects this thing to be resolved in a way that's judicious and fair to him mm-hmm and I want to I want to give everybody the benefit of the doubt that's involved with this thing and and and say that that will happen I know that there's a lot of people on the left that they some part of the resistance and they want to remove the president and all this other stuff but here's I would say you know I mean you know be careful what you wish for it's a very common-sense very practical guy I love vice president Pence I'm not saying bad against him but here's a guy that's really rising in power rising in judgment and the country's doing quite well earning on the job he's alert he's getting country tech the country's doing really quite well so you should be rooting for you know and and you know maybe you guys a daily wired wouldn't like this about me but I went to law school President Obama and what he was our president I was rooting for him because I'm an American and and I may not agree with you anyway Anthony I like you know anyway I don't agree with his policies and I'm certainly debate his policies and I would go on a television show or come on a show like this and explain to you why those policies are so damaging to the country but I didn't want us to fail but you were in law school at the same time as Barack Obama I was yeah so you got any juicy gossip I want to hear some don't yeah this is this is the thing I mean like I went to law school with them and like so all the teachers now say that they taught him which is mathematically impossible and all the people that were in law school at the time they was everything for them but you know I I didn't I mean I got to know him after law school frankly but I mean I sort of vaguely remember him from Law School justice courses was there at the time it has Law School rod Rosenstein this a little bit of trivia was actually in my section so so that's a person that you get to know because you're in the same section together you know it was Rosenstein again I haven't seen him in probably in every section I remember these little sections there's always this section jerk who knows all the answers and did all the reading and there's that guy that gets on everyone I could tell you that definitely wasn't me I didn't know the answers I was doing I wasn't doing enough for the reading I was playing too much basketball but but but I remember him being a very quiet studious guy I just didn't have a personal relationship with him so I'm not one of these guys who wants to exaggerate the relationships for a guy who's quiet and aloof he probably ended up at the right at the right place these days alright see what happens hopefully I wish him well and I want I want whatever is gonna happen now to kind of simmer down and let's all get on the same side and let's do what's right for the American people now I hope when these cameras go off that Anthony you tell me about all of the choom gang and hangouts with Barack Obama in law school but we'll see we won't be able to get it while the cameras on Anthony thank you very much I would have definitely fouled them more on the basketball court if I knew the policies back then all right thank you stay in here man I appreciate it the mooch is gonna be on Bill Maher later tonight so check it out is that gonna be live where's that pre-recorded I'm not sure it's 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time 7 p.m. here on the west coast on HBO I'm pretty sure is to tape live
