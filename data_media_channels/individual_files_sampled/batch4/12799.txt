in the studio Marisa stright the CEO of Prager University Marisa thanks for coming it is so great to be here this story that Prager you is suing YouTube suing Google it might be my favorite story in the news and there's a lot of competition here why are you suing Google so we're suing them because what they're doing is obviously wrong and just for people I think everyone in the conservative movement is aware of this YouTube is banning your videos right so we have about 250 videos 1/5 of our portfolio that's 50 videos are being either restricted or de monetized by YouTube and Google they just which ones nobody knows why well some of them it's it's not like these are violent videos these are pretty these are five minute explainer videos on perfectly interesting topics and when they restrict it you can't see them in universities and in high schools right right so that's how we found out that the videos were restricted because some of our college students started emailing us saying hey did you take down that video that I saw last night where are they and we're like no we didn't take it down so we started looking into it and they we found out that they were on restricted mode so is there any explanation have they offered you any explanation as to why their allow these topics to be talked about on the left they're all over YouTube they allow crazy content all on YouTube but sober videos explaining facts about academic subjects that that's not allowed anything about the crazy content that's on YouTube that's exactly how I produce a lot of it I know it's crazy that ours is and it's Alan Dershowitz has done a video for us on Israel's legal founding he called me a few weeks ago and as we started discussing this case because he's involved in and I'm suing and he said to me Marissa I mean what's going on does YouTube think that I'm like super attractive pornographic like Alan and don't you worry maybe dennis prager yeah yeah Alan Dershowitz as many things it's not pornographic or sensual ya know I mean they clearly hover over our channel because oftentimes videos are restricted within any within the hour and they just you know press the button and they decide that that video is ideologically inappropriate and therefore should be restricted are they going to restrict my video you know the it's pretty shocking but they haven't restricted it yet you might not be as attractive as Allender I'm really upset alan dershowitz is much more essential than i am beautiful i did why i did this video for Prager you just came out today and I love that this is all in the news now that you guys are taking on Google is there some worry because I've heard some conservatives say well Google is a private company it's a they can do what they want it's not a free speech issue why are they wrong well first of all Google defines itself as a public forum right its mission is to aggregate and make the world's information useful so it's not only that we're saying that there are the biggest vehicle of communications of today and possibly of all times right there it's saying it as well and they're claiming that that's what they are so yes they're a private company but so are shopping malls right so what shopping malls are gonna say well no conservatives can walk in here no shop you know no shops owned by conservatives obviously that's discrimination so private companies are also you know they also have to abide by discrimination laws and this is not just some little lawsuit that's gonna make the news and be thrown out you've got some pretty heavy hitters who were behind this thing yes so governor Pete Wilson former governor of California has come to us it was actually his idea to just put the foot on the gas and actually sue because honestly little Prager you I mean we're not that little anymore and we're getting much bigger one of the biggest forces on what we're talking about Google here its Goliath right so governor Wilson was the one who said listen you have to take it on I mean it's forgotten country somebody has to do it just make it happen and he's been basically the the force behind the legal team what are you hoping to get out of it do you think is this a just a stunt or is this winnable I hope it's winnable because if it's not winnable conservatives are gonna lose the Internet as they have lost the universities so this is a pretty big deal I mean we see what's happening on universities today can you imagine that Google owns the Internet I mean the way or that the Left owns the internet internet the way the Left owns the university that's a pretty big deal so we intend on doing whatever we can to win this because I've been thrilled at for so long conservatives were kept out of the culture kept out of cultural institutions publishing in New York Hollywood the entertainment industry and then there's the internet and then there's this Wild West and conservatives are so much funnier on the internet it's there is no comparison when I think of the left on the internet I think of that meme of Sandra Fluke and she's let you frowning it's like that's not funny when I went then but conservatives have a great time you get the you know Steve Crowder you get all of these great voices out there and same thing with academic stuff so the universities are completely hostile to conservatives they fire professors who are not completely left-wing Democrats there are still Democrats but they're not far enough left they're punishing students they're censoring speech they're kicking Shapiro off because he's the scariest Jewish neo-nazi in the country according to them at least we have Prager University you can go you can get these five-minute educational videos you can actually learn something is that why they're going after us there is it because they see this is our this is our chance to have a cultural impact well we're obviously very effective you know we're obviously very effective 16% of our viewership said that they changed the way they voted in the last election that's a pretty big deal you know we have over a million subscribers on YouTube alone obviously Google was paying attention to us so we're obviously very effective and they're trying to prevent us from reaching that very young audience that we're trying to reach so that's the battle here right I mean they wouldn't be picking us on us if we weren't successful and effective of course which by the way there are tons of copycats out there on YouTube that download our videos and re-upload them and I'll let you guess they are not restricted because they're making money off the prettier you videos that we make because you know obviously YouTube is not paying should I be doing that i Marshall needs a side hustle because we don't pay them anything here that is astounding because we're talking about the exact same content the content the content is downloaded by other channels and uploaded and is monetized and not restricted but on our channel so clearly it's not an algorithm because some people out there might be thinking well or whatever no it's not only clearly not an algorithm because of the copycats but they have after we have launched our petition and we had you know close to three hundred and thousand signatures on it YouTube has started responding to us and they said well we'll review your content and in fact we have reviewed your content and once reviewing your content we decided that they should be restricted so it's not an algorithm this is a community yes it's not community you know flagging they have admitted that in writing and that's when we decided to sue because we're like wait wait a second you know this is obviously discrimination violation of contract absolutely that now so you've got a million subscribers on YouTube they know who you are you're one of the biggest channels on YouTube 250 videos do you know how many views you have cuz I know most of most of these videos get a million views at least right so it depends on the video we've had a video that has gone so viral that it had 53 million views that was the the video in the electoral college and we have some videos that reach about two million views the average viewership in total between our website YouTube and and and Facebook of course is about 2 to 3 million viewers a day 2 to 3 million viewers a day and the left just can't abide that that is just too many viewers too many people changing their votes away from my cousin Hillary Clinton way too conservative yeah alright well we got a she's dangerous we got to get her out of here Marshall Marissa thank you for being here I love it I'll be I'll be eating popcorn yet when I read every single news article about this lawsuit thanks Marissa thanks
