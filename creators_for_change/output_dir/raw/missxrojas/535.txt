to be stressed before the amount of puff

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,580
is not proportionate to the amount of

<font color="#CCCCCC">on this channel in the UK if we have</font>

82
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,170
called film for and it was brilliant I

83
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,720
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed by it because they</font>

84
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,910
stuck very well to the story but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

85
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,190
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it boring the only qualm i</font>

86
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,500
had with whom they only called my head

87
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,050
nearly qua qua how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> say it unique</font>

88
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,970
what the only qualm I can't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it now</font>

89
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,910
no I've said wrong you haven't caught in

90
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,709
the middle the only issue i had a bit

91
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,959
was that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecj</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i was so bad so the</font>

92
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,630
death gods were pretty shocking but it

93
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,100
reminded me how clever the whole story

94
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,540
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wasn't about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read</font>

95
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the whole mango again soon as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i gave it</font>

96
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,070
away as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eiffel finished it just</font>

97
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,959

98
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,250
some plans to give away books I know

99
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,870
it's shocking if you have read Death

100
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:43,950
Note or if you haven't read Death Note

101
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,140
the film<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in Japanese but it has</font>

102
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,940
subtitles because I don't speak Japanese

103
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,520
as much as I would love to finally I

104
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,200
have to say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of happy birthdays</font>
