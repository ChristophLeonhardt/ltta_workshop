the US president has repeatedly stopped short of blaming Saudi Arabia for the disappearance of Jamal kesaji what happened is a terrible thing assuming that happened I mean maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised but somehow I tend to doubt it and we take it very seriously and Donald Trump says he'd oppose any move by US senators to block armed sales to Saudi in retaliation I don't like the concept of stopping an investment of a hundred and ten billion dollars into the United States because you know what they're gonna do they're gonna take that money and spend it in Russia or China or someplace else so I think there are other ways if it turns out to be as bad as it might be there are certainly other ways of handling the situation but the president says US investigators are now helping inquiries abroad with a report due in his words very soon but Turkey's foreign minister on a trip to Iraq says that's not the case but they do want Saudi help because the incident took place in Saudi Arabia's consulate we're working on this matter with the Saudi authorities and they must cooperate with us on this matter we will announce the results at the end of the investigation a leading Republican senator with access to the latest intelligence says he believes Jamal khashoggi has been murdered everything points to Saudi Arabia and it would appear that he's not alive well one Democrat says the White House can't talk about what it wouldn't do to punish Saudi Arabia president Trump's unwillingness to set out any consequences or even a threat of consequences essentially tells the Saudis that were ok with this kind of conduct and behavior last year Saudi Arabia spent more than 27 million dollars to lobby in Washington a process of seeking to influence politicians and shape policy in its favor one Washington watcher says their money can't help them with this Saudi Arabia is one of the most influential lobbying and PR machines in Washington DC but in this case the facts just speak louder than any lobbyist campaign contributions or any PR spokespersons talking points possibly could so what good is that to us no Donald Trump says he's expecting a report on the Kishori case he will come under pressure from senators to make it public when receives it Molly seems reluctant to take action against the country he's built up as a friend and an ally he might be left with no choice but to act Allen Fisher al Jazeera Washington
