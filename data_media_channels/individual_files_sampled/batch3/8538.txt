Tucker: A BAR IN PORTLAND OREGON OFFERED REPARATIONS HAPPY HOUR WHICH WHITE PEOPLE WERE NOT ALLOWED TO ATTEND BUT PAY FOR. WHITE PEOPLE DID PAY FOR THE NONWHITE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT EXACTLY? CAMMERON WHITMAN JOINS US TO TELL US ABOUT IT. HOW ARE YOU DOING. HEY, TUCKER GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. Tucker: NICE TO SEE YOU. WHAT'S THE THINKING HERE? SO, REPARATIONS HAPPY HOUR IS AN EVENT, A SUCCESSFUL EVENT THAT WAS PUT ON MY NONPROFIT BROWN HOPE. FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION ON BROWN HOPE.ORG. 40 BLACK, BROWN AND PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THIS EVENT, WE HAD OVER 150 WHITE PEOPLE DONATE. AND THIS WASN'T ABOUT ALCOHOL. I HAVE BEEN SOBER FOR 27 YEARS. SO YOU CAN TRUST I WAS NOT PUTTING ON ALCOHOLIC EVENT. WE BUILT COMMUNITY AND WE MADE A SPACE TO HEAL FROM THE IMPACT OF RACISM. AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU AS A CONSERVATIVE CAN RESPECT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY SUPPORT THIS EVENT AND SHOW THAT, YES, INDIVIDUALS CAN TAKE ACTION TO HEAL FROM THE IMPACTS OF RACISM. Tucker: IT'S A LITTLE AT PATRONIZING THOUGH NO IN THE ASSUMPTION ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE POOR AND NEED THE HELP THE WHITE PEOPLE. AND IT IT MAKES THE WHITE PEOPLE FEEL VIRTUOUS LIKE THEY ARE COMING TO THE RESCUE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW IT MAKES THE BLACK PEOPLE FEEL. BUT IT PROBABLY MAKES SOME OF THEM FEEL PATRONIZED, I WOULD THINK. THANK YOU, TUCKER. I SAW YOUR SHOW ABOUT RACISM, ROSEANNE BAR WE BOTH AGREE THAT RACISM IS REAL. WE BOTH AGREE THAT RACISM GOES TWO BASE. AND WHAT WE ARE SAY SOMETHING THAT RACIAL DISPARITIES, IF YOU LOOK AT OUR COUNTRY, THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN IS A PREDICTOR OF HOW LONG YOU WILL LIVE, WHAT KIND OF ECONOMIC LEVEL YOU WILL BE IN AND OTHER FACTORS. AND SO WHAT WE ARE SAYING. Tucker: CAMMERON, SOMEONE WHO IS FAMILIAR WITH THE NUMBERS IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE. BROADLY, MAYBE. AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS TO THIS COUNTRY HAVE HIGHER LEVEL INCOME LEVELS THAN POOR WHITE AMERICANS. IT'S NOT QUITE AS. BLACK AND WHITE AS YOU ARE SUGGESTING. I GUESS THAT'S PART OF THE POINT I'M MAKING. NOT ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE SAME NOT ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME. THEY HAVE DIFFERENT ATTITUDES AND INCOME LEVELS. YEAH. Tucker: THIS SUGGESTS YOU ARE YOU ARE SUGGESTING CERTAIN COLOR ONE CATEGORY. ANOTHER COLOR ANOTHER CATEGORY. THAT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. WHY DOESN'T THAT MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE. WE ARE SAYING RACISM IS REAL AND RACIAL DISPARITY EXISTS. WE ARE CALLING ON FOLKS FROM A PRIVILEGED DEMOGRAPHIC TO PAY INTO A SOLUTION AND INVEST IN THE LEADERSHIP OF BLACK, BROWN AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WE CARE ABOUT THE FACTS. AND THE FACTS STATE THAT RACIAL DISPARATE EXISTS AND BROWN HOPE IS OFFERED SOLUTIONS. Tucker: LET ME ASK YOU. IMPACTS RACISM. Tucker: I THINK IT'S A VERY CLEVER DEAL YOU GOT GOING. PAY FOR MY AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE. I AM CLEVER. Tucker: YOU ARE ENTREPRENEUR IN A HILARIOUS WAY. WHO WOULD. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A TINY EVENT ALREADY HAPPENED ON PORTLAND NOW I'M ON FOX NEWS AND NOW "NEW YORK TIMES" IS COVERING IT WE ELEVATED REPARATIONS. Tucker: LET ME ASK YOU THIS, WOULD IT MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE IF SOMEONE WHO MADE LESS THAN YOU DID PAID FOR YOUR MEAL OR YOUR DRINKS BECAUSE YOU WERE A DIFFERENT COLOR? WOULD THAT MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE? SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE REAL WEALTH DISPARITY IN OUR COUNTRY AND WE KNOW THAT THE WEALTH DISPARITY BETWEEN BLACK'S AND WHITES IS AROUND 10 TO 1. SO WE KNOW. Tucker: NO, THAT'S NOT NO, NO, THAT'S NOT SPEAKING IN GENERAL TERMS. I ALREADY GAVE YOU ONE OF MY COUNTER FACTS IS AFRICAN IMMIGRANTS MAKE MORE THAN WHITE AMERICANS ON AVERAGE. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT THE REALITIES OF THIS COUNTRY. Tucker: GENERAL TERMS. THAT AT THIS TIME PARTICULARS. YOU SEEM UNCOMFORTABLE. Tucker: I'M AMUSED. BUT, LET ME ASK YOU THIS. ME TOO. Tucker: DOES IT MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE TO GENERALIZE ON THE BASIS OF RACE IN THE WAY THAT YOU ARE, DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOU ARE MAKING MONEY FROM IT, WHICH AGAIN, AS A CAPITALIST I APPLAUD. IT'S AN AMAZING SCAM. IT'S NOT A SCAM. Tucker: IT. EVEN LOOKING AT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. WE SAW THAT RACIAL DISPARITIES EXISTED AND BE LIKE OH, GENERALLY SOME PEOPLE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA WERE DOCTORS. SOME PEOPLE COULD VOTE. WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD EXCEPTIONALISM. IN THE GENERAL FACT, LOOK AT THE FACTS. THE FACTS MATTER AND WE KNOW THAT RACIAL DISPARATE. Tucker: SO EMPOWERMENT IS WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS TO INVEST IN THIS WORK. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL. Tucker: SEND ME A GUILT OFFERING AND PAY FOR MY DRINKS. YOU ARE WINNING THIS GAME. YOU ARE THE WINNER. I LOVE THAT CAMMERON, IT'S GREAT TO TELL YOU. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO CAME WE GOT $10 IN CASH FROM THE FOLKS. HE THEY SPENT THAT MONEY ON GAS AND PAID FOR RENT FOR A FRIEND IT'S NOT ABOUT ALCOHOL. WE CALLED IT HAPPY HOUR. Tucker: YOU MADE MONEY. CAMMERON. THAT'S RIGHT. WE ELEVATED REPARATIONS. Tucker: GOOD JOB. GOOD JOB. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE OUT OF
