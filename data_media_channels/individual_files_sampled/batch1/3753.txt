that's the great thing about America you know people love to talk about how hard it is and how little opportunity there isn't and to me I have to tell you that's just a bunch of crap this is still the greatest country in the world for opportunity the only play the only people that tell me there's no opportunity America are people in America when I travel the world that we are still the beacon of free enterprise is it hard to get ahead absolutely but if you want to start a small business this is one of the best places yeah I mean you know on the rough days I wish I was Mark Cuban son and I was born into a wealthy family I'd never have to work for a living you know you can't change the past and I always say there's no rearview mirror in my life in my race car you should I keep going forward that's the thing that you see about great business owners is this undying optimism they're realistic but they're optimistic and that rhymes
