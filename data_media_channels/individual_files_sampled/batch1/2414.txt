this is the conscious investor presented by Nuveen I'm here with Sally Krawczyk well-known for her successful career on Wall Street as a best-selling author and as the CEO and co-founder of L of s can you talk to me about what the mission of a low vest is so L of s is pretty straightforward it's a tech enabled investing platform for women and its goal is to get women more money money is power the guys have more of it than we do we will not be fully equal with the guys we love we won't be fully equal with them until we're financially equal with them we hear a lot about the gender pay gap we've heard much less about the gender investing gap which can cost some women as much or more as the gender pay gap so having spent my career on Wall Street recognizing this gap exists which women sort of blame themselves for we took a step back and said let's build an investing platform completely around what women are looking for go really deep on this thing thousands of hours and we found that we invest differently we're more goals base than guys are we have different salary trajectories different life spans that have to be taken into account there are a range of things which are leading to our success and you recently launched platform of impact portfolios exactly right so the other thing we learned is that the significant majority of women depends on the piece of research but 86 percent of women 84 percent of women whatever some big percent of women are interested in impact investments again depending on the research less than 10 percent of financial advisors have even spoken to them about it so we saw a huge unmet need out there for impact investments and what are your impact portfolios look like yeah so ours are a little different from others so we're providing them today let's talk about our digital platform in the form of ETFs up to about 50% of the portfolio can be impact can't get higher because the market is still so new like other impact investments were all about earning a competitive financial return like other impact investments were all about advancing social and economic change for the positive but unlike other impact investments our means to the end our way of doing it is by getting money into the hands of women and advancing women and getting money to companies that advance women what some might call gender lens investing though with really a focus on getting real money to real women and how do you identify companies that are advancing women what does that look like yeah so our underlying investments do that for us so we have the PAC's elevate fund of which I am full disclosure partial owner and continued full disclosure make any earnings that I would have made from that will go to go to a nonprofit so I don't get a benefit from and we also have the she index as well both of which are part of this and and for those those companies those organizations pick them at packs elevate its looking at percent of women on boards percent of women in leadership teams and then ranking them so it's not hey they did this really interesting you know event with their diversity group or XYZ interesting is know are the results there and what the research tells us is those companies that have greater diversity in senior leadership tend to have higher returns on equity not by little by lot tend to have greater client engagement tend to have greater employee engagement tend to have a greater long-term perspective tend to have more innovation and so the thinking behind it is those great things happen those are good for the company good for the markets good for the economy so it's not just about supporting women to support women it's because there's also a financial payoff oh my gosh so you know now you're getting me started right so I just talked about the good things that happen when you have greater diversity in companies but other great things that happen with women and money if you give a woman alone she is more likely to pay back when she builds wealth from that loan she's more likely much more likely than gentlemen to put it into the community and into her family when she starts a business we talked about you know when she's in management when she starts a business her startup typically does much better than male only run startups in terms the returns when she has well she gives a greater percent of it to nonprofits so all these great things happen now what I will admit and one thing so I've been on a journey with this myself right I was on the journey that was like impact in best though you have to give up return right you know got over that and then hot getting money to women that feels sort of nichy and weird and strange and why would that make sense okay now I'm seeing the research I guess I see it but actually we invest with the gender lens already it's just we're investing in men right and we love men we think they're amazing but you know one of the key tenants of investing is diversification and so rather than have a hundred percent or ninety eight percent or ninety percent of the portfolio and going to men men run companies shifting a bit of it can add diversification I believe you have first-hand experience and working in a environment that is mostly men what do you think is still holding the advancement of women back within corporations men is pretty clear and it's not the thing it's not the CEOs don't get it because they get it and it's not that people don't want to do it they do I believe it is that the way we have been socialized leads us to have intuition that is incorrect that overrules the research we see about the positive effects of diversity what do I mean by that that when I look to hire somebody and she reminds me of myself I just think she's amazing and even you could say hey but the research Charlie says you should hire somebody completely different I'm like yeah but she's awesome right and I can think how she'll do the job you know another example we tend to as a as corporate America promote men on potential and promote women and people of color based on what they've achieved right so there's actually a lower bar for individuals who are like those in power than there is for people of difference so we don't even see this but it's again because our intuition does not allow us to extrapolate you know for these people of difference what we can extrapolate for the majority I could go on and on but our in in the intuition of those who are in power overrides what they see is the research on a day to day to day basis you know when they're making individual hires and it seems that some of these biases it's a lot of people have tried to reach women as like as an investment group before but these biases sometimes feed into the products they create for women what are some of your pet peeves about the earlier iterations well none of them worked and I think none of them worked because number one they identified the problem as a marketing problem women don't invest enough we need to market to them differently and by the way while we're marking to them differently we need to tell them how to change right so we need to tell them that they need more financial education and women will say I think I need more financial education do you know what's more interesting than financial education everything right and so women as the industry said you need more financial education we have a woman's initiative that has financial education women would say ok they take the book home they take the website home and you know then doing the laundry is actually more fascinating so we it was really marketing and it was about how to change some of it in the early days was condescending don't buy shoes invest in the market probably because it went through the lens not of women themselves but you know of the male executives who were saying this you know this is what I think women are looking for they didn't attack the underlying issue they assumed the product was fine right so the mutual funds are fine the ETF's are fine we'll just market them differently and we at Ella best attack the underlying offering so you know we found that when women think about it when men think about investing they think about outperforming and winning and money and how much to make women actually think about reaching their goals if I invest can I retire at the age of 65 well can I take the trip around the world in ten years can I buy the house in five years but when they go to some of the traditional offerings they're thinking buy the house and then they're met with would you like a mutual fund or ETF right so it was just so out of synch for them that they stood back you
