1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,520
What if I told you that

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,080
To Kill A Mockingbird is overrated?

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,440
“Can you, uh...can you read and write?”

4
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,250
Wait, Atticus, let me explain, let me explain.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,020
What I’m saying is it’s weird how

6
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,200
this book is so, so famous.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,660
Let me tell you a story.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,480
I read this book for fun in fourth grade.

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,040
I lived in Tennessee, thought it was amazing,

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,620
even though I probably didn’t understand it.

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:24,520
Moved.

12
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,080
Read it in sixth grade class.

13
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Moved.

14
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,900
Read it ninth grade.

15
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,840
Moved.

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,780
Read it again.

17
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,920
By the end of school,

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,160
I had read this book six times. Six times.

19
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,060
I personally never read any

20
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,820
of these books for school.

21
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,940
So was To Kill A Mockingbird really 600%

22
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,030
better than all of these other books?

23
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,010
I think there’s a surprising reason it’s so famous.

24
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,190
Beyond Atticus Finch being great.

25
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,100
“I don’t care what the reasons are.”

26
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,600
Please.

27
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,780
Give me a chance.

28
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,680
To understand why this book was a school staple,

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,040
you need to understand other books.

30
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,120
Like the illicit love in The Hangman’s Whip.

31
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,880
When Harper Lee got To Kill A Mockingbird

32
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,960
published in 1960, she never expected it

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,890
to be a massive hit.

34
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,980
As she said in her only radio interview:

35
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,840
“My reaction to it was not one of surprise,

36
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,360
it was one of sheer numbness.”

37
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,640
It got a good review in the New York Times

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,630
(though it earned less coverage than “Ceremony

39
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,140
in Lone Tree” by Wright Morris).

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,720
But let’s be clear: it sold millions of copies in hardback.

41
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,810
It won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1961.

42
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,820
The hit movie came out in 1962.

43
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,400
Here’s Gregory Peck, AKA Atticus,

44
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,660
and Harper Lee, posing as...

45
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,000
well, I don’t know why they’re posing like that,

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,160
but I like it.

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,640
The movie poster had a big picture

48
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,640
of the book on it.

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,200
So this book was a big critical and popular hit.

50
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,260
But it didn’t win all of the awards.

51
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,400
And it wasn't the best selling book of the year.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,600
So what took it from hit to legend?

53
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,120
The most important thing to notice about

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,840
that 1961 Pulitzer Prize isn’t the prize.

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,600
It’s the year.

56
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,780
You probably recognize this logo.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,080
It’s from Penguin Books, and it’s familiar

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,680
because the company has been around,

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,180
with pretty much the same waddling logo,

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,180
since 1935.

61
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,100
When Allen Lane founded the UK company,

62
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,760
paperback books were revolutionary.

63
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,360
The idea was to print good books, in paperback,

64
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
so they’d be cheaper than hardbacks.

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,100
That revolution quickly spread to America

66
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,580
with Pocket Books and other competitors.

67
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,280
But it wasn’t just about cheap paper

68
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,080
and tiny, mass market size books.

69
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,779
Distribution was key.

70
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:57,200
Suddenly, cheap books flooded dime stores,

71
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,699
newsstands, and gas stations.

72
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,280
Crime writers like Mickey Spillane

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
became huge stars.

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,360
Just look at this guy.

75
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,240
He’s an author.

76
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
The books started out seedy.

77
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,060
Popular Library published stuff like

78
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,940
Silence in Court!

79
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,559
and Devil Take Her.

80
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,180
But respectable stuff trickled in too,

81
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,820
occasionally with sexy covers,

82
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:20,780
like this shirtless Great Gatsby.

83
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,180
*whistle*

84
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,160
Paperbacks became mainstream quickly.

85
00:03:25,169 --> 00:03:27,980
By 1961, the New York Times was calling it

86
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,110
“The Paperback Revolution.”

87
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,860
They said paperbacks weren’t just for

88
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,189
“sex, sadism and the smoking gun.”

89
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,799
The books were actually being used...in schools.

90
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,140
That’s where To Kill A Mockingbird comes in.

91
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,020
Remember that book, The Hangman’s Whip?

92
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:47,760
Popular Library published that, and in 1962

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,060
they also put out the mass market paperback

94
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,840
for To Kill A Mockingbird.

95
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,019
Paperbacks were finally coming into their own.

96
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:56,659
And To Kill A Mockingbird had perfect timing.

97
00:03:56,659 --> 00:03:58,560
Teachers had a cheap, popular,

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,839
respectable book.

99
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,800
And throughout the 60s, paperback

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,159
publishers thought of education as El Dorado.

101
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,800
El Dorado’s a mythical city of gold,

102
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,200
in case you forgot.

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,240
Margins on mass-market paperbacks

104
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,480
were small, so publishers made money

105
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,540
by selling huge numbers.

106
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,940
Paperbacks sold a lot of copies worldwide.

107
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,220
5 million.

108
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,440
11 million.

109
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,340
And on and on and on.

110
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,960
That’s why To Kill A Mockingbird is so famous.

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
And you get the sense Harper knew it, too.

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,300
When Lee died, her estate almost immediately

113
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,540
said they would discontinue the mass market

114
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,720
version of the book.

115
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,620
Even if you think the paperback revolution

116
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,040
made the book overrated,

117
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,840
it’s still kind of sad.

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,620
These books, these cheap paperback,

119
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,080
kinda hard to read mass-market books —

120
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,820
they're worth more than their price.

121
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,200
Maybe they shouldn’t be killed.

122
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,020
“Mockingbirds don’t do anything but

123
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,040
make music for us to enjoy.

124
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,880
They don’t eat people’s gardens,

125
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,020
don’t nest in the corncribs.

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,100
They don’t do one thing but just

127
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,360
sing their hearts out for us.”

128
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,960
This video is actually the first

129
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,320
in a series we're doing

130
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,000
about Overrated icons.

00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,020

all sorts of other stuff about things that

135
00:05:20,320 --> 00:00:00,000
might be just a little overrated.
