1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,560
Russian hackers attempted to influence the
US presidential election.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,440
A meddling campaign carried out by the Russians,
authorized at the highest levels.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,440
Russian interference in the 2016 presidential
election is now pretty well-documented.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,379
From hacking voter registration rolls...

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,199
Russia is behind a cyber attack on a contractor
for Florida's election system...

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,620
To leaking stolen DNC emails...

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,220
The Russians were responsible for hacking
the DNC.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,360
But perhaps their most ingenious tool is this:

9
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,480
it's a video of a guy watching news coverage

10
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:42,749
of ISIS taking credit for an explosion at
a chemical plant in Louisiana.

11
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:46,911
If you're having trouble remembering this
horrifying chemical plant explosion, well

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,899
that's because it never happened.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,580
Oh man, this is f***ed up.

14
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:58,040
So if this totally legit American accent didn't
already tip you off,

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,800
this video is a fake.

16
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,240
It's the handiwork (and I'm using that term
loosely here), of a shadowy Russian organization

17
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,340
with ties to the Kremlin called the Internet
Research Agency.

18
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,620
The agency does a lot more than video.

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,000
Fake Russian accounts posing as Americans
have released a barrage of social media posts.

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,520
The topics of these posts vary, but the goal
is always the same: to spread fear and drive

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,759
Americans opinions to the extremes.

22
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,990
Russia wants to destabilize Western democracies.

23
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,499
The Russian effort stands out just in terms
of the financing behind it and the level of

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,640
organization that we saw in this campaign.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,680
Thanks to a recent federal inditement, we
now know more than ever about how exactly

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,480
Russia has been shaping the opinions of the
American public.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,100
Russians employed by people with ties to the
Kremlin are asked to create convincing social

28
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,960
media accounts that can pass as real Americans.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,800
Every so often, they're instructed to incorporate
a Kremlin-approved message into their posts.

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,399
Then, other professional internet trolls at
the agency, sometimes with the aid of bots,

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,580
comment on and share that original post.

32
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:17,540
If the trolls are successful, the messages
promoted in these fake posts will leave the

33
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,540
circle of fake accounts and be shared by actual
Americans.

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,220
These operations employ VPNs, that's Virtual
Private Networks, that can mask their computer's

35
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,160
IP address to create the appearance that their
posts originate in the US.

36
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,260
And they even make sure to post during US
daytime hours to make their posts appear more

37
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,840
plausible.

38
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,420
There's ample proof that this scheme occurred
during the election and even as recently as

39
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,720
the Parkland shooting in Florida.

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,420
It's not that the Russian government cares
specifically about American gun rights or

41
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,200
ISIS activity in the US.

42
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,340
The point is to create division and fear.

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,880
They figure, anything that destabilizes Europe
or the United States redounds to their benefit,

44
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,540
so they understand that our society is very
divided now.

45
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,440
There are divisions based on race, economic
interest as well as political persuasion.

46
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,400
It's actually very easy to pit groups against
one another.

47
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,640
The Russian government originally deployed
internet trolls within Russia.

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,040
In 2011, the country was roiled by protests
in response to the election that year, which

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,640
was criticized for being fraudulent.

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:36,560
The government reacted by cracking down on
the internet, but also employed internet trolls

51
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,040
to counter the protestors by spreading pro-Kremlin
propaganda.

52
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,739
While Russian trolls were proven to have spread
misinformation during the 2016 election, the

53
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:50,840
actual effect they had on the election is
very difficult, if not impossible, to prove.

54
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,239
But the idea of a foreign government trying
to drive a wedge between the American public

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,340
is extremely worrying.

56
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,320
Twitter has removed nearly 4,000 accounts
found to be operated by Russian trolls.

57
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:07,069
And Facebook has promised changes to its algorithm
for how it serves up content in your newsfeed,

58
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:09,090
to help combat the problem.

59
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,239
But these social media companies don't acknowledge
the divisiveness that's homegrown.

60
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,760
It's easy to suspend inauthentic and foreign
social media accounts, but what about when

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,620
real Americans are posting about virtually
the same thing?

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,000
Too many Americans are getting all their information
from one source, whether it's a liberal, moderate,

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,240
or conservative site.

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,660
That's dangerous just in and of itself, but
especially dangerous during an era of false

65
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,250
or misleading information.

66
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,950
The most important thing the average news
consumer can do is to rely on a diversity

67
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,660
of sources of information.

68
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,670

off the lighter side of social media, our
