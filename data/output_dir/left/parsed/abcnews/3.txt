>> Announcer: THIS IS AN ABC 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
THE KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION VOTE.
NOW REPORTING, DAVID MUIR.
>>> GOOD MORNING.
WE'RE COMING ON THE AIR AT THIS 
HOUR WITH BREAKING NEWS.
CRUCIAL VOTE ON SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH IS NOW 
UNDER WAY ON CAPITOL HILL.
THE SENATE IS VOTING RIGHT NOW.
ON WHETHER TO ADVANCE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION TO A 
FINAL CONFIRMATION.
THAT FINAL VOTE COULD COME AS 
EARLY AS TOMORROW.
THIS VOTE IS CRUCIAL RIGHT NOW.
ALL EYES ARE STILL ON FOUR 
UNDECIDED SENATORS.
REPUBLICAN SENATORS SUSAN 
COLLINS, LISA MURKOWSKI AND JEFF
FLAKE WHO JUST VOTED AYE TO MOVE
THIS FORWARD.
WE'RE ALSO WATCHING JOE MANCHIN 
THIS MORNING FROM WEST VIRGINIA.
HE HAS SAID THAT HE'S NOT 
DECIDED BEFORE ROOIFING IN THE 
CHAMBER THIS MORNING.
REPUBLICAN SUSAN COLLINS HAS 
VOTED YES TO ADVANCE IT FORWARD.
SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN CHUCK 
GRASSLEY SAYING WE DON'T KNOW 
HOW IT'S GOING TO GO UNTIL THE 
VOTES GET CAST.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WRITING HIS 
FIERY TESTIMONY MIGHT HAVE TOO 
EMOTIONAL IN AN OP-ED.
IT'S NOW UP TO THE SENATORS TO 
DECIDE.
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, CON 
STUDENTS BACK HOME WILL BE W
WATCHING BACK HOME.
LET'S LISTEN IN TO THE VOTE.
JEFF FLAKE VOTING AYE TO MOVE IT
FORWARD.
>> MR. REED.
MR. RI. RISCH.
MR. ROBERTS.
>> AYE. 
>> MR. ROUNDS. 
>> AYE. 
>> MR. RUBIO. 
>> OF COURSE AS WE LISTEN IN TO 
THE SENATE CHAMBER, IT CAN BE 
DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE ACTUAL 
VOTE.
INSTEAD HEARING THE NAMES BEING 
CALLED.
WATCHING THIS WITH ME IS MARY 
BRUCE.
MARY, WE WERE TAKING NOTE THAT A
SHORT TIME AGO SENATORS COLLINS 
AND MURKOWSKI THEY DIDN'T ENTER 
TOGETHER, THEY WERE SEEN TALKING
TO ONE ANOTHER.
>> DAVID, ALWAYS INTERESTING TO 
SEE THE BODY LANGUAGE HERE.
BETWEEN THESE KEY UNDECIDED 
VOTES.
THOSE KEY SENATORS WE HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING SO CLOSELY IN THESE 
PAST FEW DAYS.
ONE THING THAT STRIKES ME SO 
MUCH THIS MORNING IS HOW TRULY 
SO MANY OF THESE SENATORS ARE 
STILL WRESTLING WITH THIS 
DECISION.
NOT JUST BY THE POLITICS HERE 
BUT GENUINELY THE UNDECIDED 
VOTERS STILL SEEM TO BE 
STRUGGLING WITH THIS VOTE.
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN TOOK ANOTHER
LOOK AT THE FBI REPORT ON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S ALLEGED ALLEGATIONS 
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT.
HE TOLD REPORTERS THAT HE DIDN'T
THINK HOW HE WAS GOING TO VOTE 
UNTIL HE WALKED THROUGH THE 
DOORS HERE TODAY. 
>> SOME BREAKING NEWS, WHILE YOU
WERE REPORTING IN, WE HEARD 
SENATOR MURKOWSKI VOTED NO TO 
THIS CLOTURE VOTE.
OF COURSE, SHE'S BEEN ONE OF 
THOSE KEY SENATORS WHO WE DID 
NOT KNOW WHICH WAY SHE WOULD GO.
SHE'S A SENATOR FROM ALASKA.
IT HAD BEEN REPORTED THAT 
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT HAD 
BEEN IN HER OFFICE YESTERDAY.
AS WE KNOW SENATORS ON CAPITOL 
HILL HAVE BEEN RECEIVING MANY 
CALLS SINCE THE TESTIMONY OF DR.
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD LAST WEEK.
AGAIN, MURKOWSKI MEETING WITH 
SOME OF THOSE VICTIMS IN THE 
LAST 24 HOURS IT'S BEEN 
REPORTED.
THIS MORNING, VOTING NO ON THIS 
CLOTURE VOTE.
SENATOR MURKOWSKI SAID BEFORE 
THE TESTIMONY LAST WEEK BEFORE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND DR. FORD, 
QUOTE, WE'RE NOW IN A PLACE 
WHETHER OR NOT JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
IS QUALIFIED IT'S ABOUT WHETHER 
OR NOT A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN A 
VICTIM AT SOME POINT IN HER LIFE
IS TO BE BELIEVED.
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT.
SENATOR MURKOWSKI'S NO VOTE IS 
SIGNIFICANT.
>> SHE MIGHT BE MAKING THIS 
VOTE.
SHE HAD BEEN UNDER TREMENDOUS 
PRESSURE FROM HER CONSTITUENTS.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN 
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS DEBATE THAT
WE HAVE SEEN HERE ON THE HILL.
THE LEVEL OF INTERACTION BETWEEN
PROTESTERS AND THESE KEY 
UNDECIDED VOTES.
THESE KEY SWING VOTES HAS BEEN 
REALLY SOMETHING TO WATCH.
SOMETHING TREMENDOUS.
WE HAVE SEEN PROTESTERS NOT JUST
HERE ON THE STREETS OUTSIDE OF 
WASHINGTON BUT ACTUALLY ENGAGING
SENATORS DIRECTLY.
TAKING THEIR CASE TO THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVES, EITHER TO 
SUPPORT OR TO VOTE AGAINST JUDGE
KAVANAUGH.
LISA MURKOWSKI UNDER TREMENDOUS 
PRESSURE AND NOW WE KNOW SHE'S 
VOTING "NO" TO ADVANCE THIS 
DEBATE.
>> HELP VIEWERS UNDERSTAND HOW 
THIS WORK, MARY, A "NO" VOTE 
THIS MORNING IN THE CLOTURE 
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN A "NO" 
VOTE IN THE CONFIRMATION.
>> THIS IS A PROCEDURAL VOTE.
HOW SENATORS VOTE TODAY DOESN'T 
NECESSARILY DIRECT HOW THEY'LL 
VOTE ON FINAL PASSAGE.
IF THIS VOTE GOES THROUGH, 
THEY'LL LIKELY VOTE ON FINAL 
PASSAGE SOME TIME TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON.
YOU MENTIONED SUSAN COLLINS.
COLLINS IS A YES NOW TO THIS 
VOTE.
SHE COULD TECHNICALLY VOTE NO 
TOMORROW BUT THAT SEEMS UNLIKELY
GIVEN SOME OF THE SIGNS WE HAVE 
SEEN COMING FROM HER.
SHE THOUGHT THAT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION WAS THOROUGH.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON.
DAVID. 
>> WYDEN.
MR. SENATORS, NO.
MR. LEE.
>> AYE. 
>> AYE.
MR. HASSAN?
NO.
>> AS WE LISTEN IN HERE, NOW 
PULLING SOME OF THE DEMOCRATIC 
SENATORS.
THIS IS NOT TYPICAL.
THE PROCEDURE THAT'S UNDER WAY 
HERE THIS MORNING.
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP CLOSE WATCH
ON WHAT IT IS WE'RE WITNESSING.
WE KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRATIC 
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, ONE OF THE 
UNDECIDES GOING INTO THIS 
MORNING VOTING "YES" TO THIS 
CLOTURE VOTE.
THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON 
SENATOR MANCHIN.
HE COMES FROM WEST VIRGINIA 
WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON 
HANDILY IN THE 2016 ELECTION.
MR. MAMPLIN IS A DEMOCRAT AND 
HAS BEEN DELIBERATING.
AND HAD BEEN IN THE SECURE ROOM 
WHERE THE FINDINGS OF THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION ARE, UNDER LOCK 
AND KEY.
HE SAID THAT HE WAS UNDECIDED.
HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THE 
FINDINGS OF THAT REPORT AGAIN, 
BEFORE HEADING INTO THIS ROOM TO
VOTE. 
>> MR. DONNELLY. 
>> COKIE ROBERTS WATCHING THIS 
UNFOLD THIS MORNING.
THIS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM 
WHAT WE NORMALLY SEE. 
>> DAVID, WHEN SENATORS TAKE A 
VOTE THEY'RE WANDERING ON AND 
OFF THE FLOOR.
THEY'RE TALKING TO EACH OTHER.
ONLY THREE, FOUR ON THE FLOOR AT
THE SAME TIME.
HERE, THEY'RE SITTING IN THEIR 
SEATS.
LISTENING.
SERIOUS.
CALM.
STANDING TO VOTE.
THIS IS A VERY, VERY SERIOUS 
PROCEEDING AND THEY KNOW IT AND 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE BEHAVING IN 
THIS FASHION.
THEY'RE ALL THERE AND THEY'RE 
TAKING THIS QUITE RIOUSLY.
NORMALLY, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, 
WITH THE CLOTURE VOTE, TO VOTE 
TO END DEBATE, IF YOU VOTE "YES"
ON CLOTURE, IT MEANS TAKING IT 
TO THE NEXT STEP.
IF YOU VOTE "NO" ON CLOSURE, 
YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T WANT TO 
TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP.
IT'S VERY, VERY UNLIKELY THAT 
YOU WOULD THEN VOTE FOR THE 
NOMINEE.
THE FACT THAT LISA MURKOWSKI HAS
VOTED "NO" IS HIGHLY 
SIGNIFICANT.
THE FACT THAT JOE MANCHIN AND 
SUE COLLINS VOTED "YES" IS ALSO 
SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT QUITE AS 
SIGNIFICANT. 
>> WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE THE 50 VOTES 
THEY WERE LOOKING FOR FOR 
CLOSURE.
BUT AS COKIE JUST MENTIONED, 
SOMETIMES THIS INITIAL VOTE OF 
CLOSURE IS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT 
TO COME.
FOR LISA MURKOWSKI, COKIE, THIS 
WAS SIGNIFICANT THAT SHE WAS A 
"NO" VOTE THIS MORNING AND 
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, A "YES" 
VOTE.
>> HE COULD BE THE SENATOR TO 
BRING JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO THE 
SUPREME COURT.
LISA MURKOWSKI IS NOT UP THIS 
YEAR.
SHE KNOWS HOW TO WORK ALASKA.
SHE LOST HER PRIMARY THE LAST 
TIME SHE RAN.
THEN, RAN AS A WRITE-IN 
CANDIDATE.
SHE'S NOT AS FEARFUL OF THE 
REPUBLICAN BASE AS SOME OF THE 
OTHERS ARE.
SUSSAN COLLINS I'M TOLD, IF SHE 
VOTES AGAINST KAVANAUGH SHE'S 
LIKELY NOT TO BE NOMINATED AGAIN
BY REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE OF 
MAINE.
>> JON KARL WATCHING WITH US 
THIS MORNING.
SENIOR WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT.
WHAT ARE WE TO READ INTO SENATOR
SUSAN COLLINS, YES TO CLOSURE 
BUT APPEAR LATER ON THIS 
AFTERNOON AND DELIVER A SPEECH 
WHAT HER FINAL DECISION WILL BE.
>> I THINK IT'S MERELY 
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE THAT SUSAN
COLLINS WOULD VOTE YES ON THIS 
THE CRITICAL VOTE AND THEN 
CHANGE HER MIND OR VOTE 
DIFFERENTLY ON THE FINAL VOTE.
SHE HAS HER BIG SPEECH AT 3:00, 
THE MOST IMMEDIATE IMPACT OF HER
SAYING THAT SHE'S NOT ANNOUNCING
YET HOW SHE'LL VOTE ON THE FINAL
VOTE.
I THINK IT'S A WAY TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT DRAMA 
LEFT AND ATTENTION.
WE'LL ALL BE WATCHING HER 
SPEECH.
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH WHAT 
MARY BRUCE HAS SAID ABOUT ALL OF
COLLINS' COMMENTS.
NOW, THIS VOTE.
THEY ALL POINT IN THE DIRECTION 
OF HER VOTING "YES" ON THE FINAL
CONFIRMATION.
DAVID, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS WE 
HAVE SEEN THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
WILL BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
>> JON KARL WATCHING THIS 
MORNING.
AND AGAIN, THAT KEY AND CRUCIAL 
VOTE AS WE WERE SAYING, SENATOR 
JOE MANCHIN, DEMOCRAT OF WEST 
VIRGINIA, THIS IS NOT HIS FINAL 
VOTE.
HE DID VOTE "YES" THIS MORNING 
TO END THE DEBATE TO END THE 
DEBATE OF WHETHER BRETT 
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO
THE SUPREME COURT.
SOME VERY STRONG INDICATORS IT 
LOOKS LIKE JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL 
BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE.
IF THAT DOES HAPPEN, THE SWING 
SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT WILL 
SHIFT TO MORE 
CONSERVATIVE-LEANING FOR 
GENERATIONS.
HISTORIC VOTE.
WE'RE WATCHING THE FIRST ROUND 
OF THIS.
IT'S NO GUARANTEE OF WHAT COULD 
COME AS EARLY AS TOMORROW.
SOME STRONG INDICATORS THAT 
WE'RE WITNESSING THIS MORNING IS
VERY POSITIVE FOR BOTH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND FOR PRESIDENT 
TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE.
I WANT TO BRING IN TERRY MORAN 
WHO HAS COVERED THE SUPREME 
COURT FOR US FOR YEARS.
IT'S VERY RARE PERHAPS WE 
HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN OUR 
LIFETIME, A RETIRED SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE WEIGHS IN ON THE 
EVE OF THIS CLOSURE VOTE.
JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEPHENS.
HE DID REVEAL THAT HE CHANGED 
HIS VIEWS FOR REASONS THAT HAD 
NO RELATIONSHIP TO BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S INTELLECTUAL 
ABILITY.
HE REVEALED IN THE LAST 24 
HOURS, QUOTE, I FEEL HIS 
PERFORMANCE THE HEARINGS 
ULTIMATELY CHANGED MY MIND AND 
ULTIMATELY DISQUALIFIED HIM FROM
THE SUPREME COURT 
>> JOHN PAUL STEPHENS, LONGTIME 
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT FORD, A 
LIFELONG REPUBLICAN.
VOTED LIBERAL.
BUT WAS SEEN ON THIS COURT BY 
ALL OF THE OTHER MEMBERS AS VERY
CORDIAL, VERY CORRECT IN THE WAY
HE APPROACHED JUSTICE'S DUTIES.
FOR HIM TO COME FORWARD ON JUDGE
KAVANAUGH, KNOWN TO THESE 
JUSTICES, A RISING STAR FOR A 
GENERATION AMONG CONSERVATIVE 
LAWYERS TO COME OUT AND SAY HIS 
PERFORMANCE AT THE HEARING 
CHANGED MY MIND AND TO SAY IT 
PUBLICLY WAS A REBUKE.
>> ON THIS VOTE, THE AYES ARE 
51.
THE NOs ARE 49.
THE MOTION IS AGREED TO. 
>> WE JUST HEARD THE GAVEL THERE
MOMENTS AGO.
THEY HAVE NOW VOTED TO END 
DEBATE INTO NOMINEE JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH.
THIS NOW SETS THINGS IN MOTION 
FOR A HISTORIC VOTE AS EARLY AS 
TOMORROW.
WHICH COULD LEAD TO BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BECOMING THE NEXT 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
VERY KEY VOTE THIS MORNING.
NOT A GUARANTEE OF WHICH WAY 
HE'LL GO THIS WEEK.
HE SAID THIS MORNING, HE WAS NOT
READY, HE WAS UNDECIDED AND THAT
HE HEADED BACK INTO THAT ROOM 
WHERE THE FINDINGS OF THIS FBI 
INVESTIGATION STILL REMAIN 
LOCKED UP. 
>> HE ACTUALLY SAID HE WAS GOING
TO REMAIN UNDECIDED UNTIL HE 
WALKED INTO THE CHAMBER FOR THAT
VOTE.
ADDING SOME DRAMA, HE DIDN'T 
VOTE WHEN HIS NAME WAS FIRST 
CALLED.
ONE OF THE FINAL SENATORS TO 
CAST THEIR VOTE.
AND WHAT MANCHIN DOES -- FIRST 
OF ALL, IF HE VOTED NO, THIS 
STILL WOULD HAVE PASSED.
THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED THE 
TIE-BREAKING VOTE BY THE VICE 
PRESIDENT.
THIS MAKES THIS NOT QUITE A 
TOTAL PARTISAN VOTE.
S
WITHOUT THAT SINGLE VOTE, A 
SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA, A 
STATE THAT DONALD TRUMP WON IN A
LANDSLIDE, WITHOUT THAT SINGLE 
VOTE WE WOULD SEE HERE, WE WOULD
BE HEADED TOWARDS THE FIRST 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE TO BE 
CONFIRMED STRICTLY ON PARTY 
LINES.
THIS IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU 
CAN GET.
SINGLE VOTE FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
THIS IS SUCH A BREAK FROM 
PRECEDENT.
NEIL GORSUCH HAD THREE DEMOCRAT 
VOTES.
REMEMBER, IT'S BEEN THROUGHOUT 
HISTORY, SUPREME COURT NOMINEES 
HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED BY WIDE 
BIPARTISAN MARGINS.
RUTH BADER GINSBURG WON 
CONFIRMATION WITH ONLY THREE 
SENATORS VOTING NO.
ANTONIN SCALIA WAS CONFIRMED TO 
THE SUPREME COURT, 98-0.
HERE WE ARE AT A STATE 
REFLECTING THE DIVIDE, THE 
POLITICAL DIVIDE IN OUR COUNTRY,
REFLECTING WHAT WE SAW WITH 
THESE HEARINGS, WE HAVE A 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE HEADED 
TOWARDS WHAT WILL BY WOULD 
ARGUE, AN ALMOST CERTAIN 
CONFIRMATION, WITH A SINGLE VOTE
FROM THE OTHER POLITICAL PARTY.
JUST A SINGLE VOTE.
OTHERWISE, PARTY LINE.
>> PARTY LINE WITH THE IN 
ADDITION OF ONE DEMOCRAT, JOE 
MANCHIN BEING A SIGNIFICANT AND 
KEY VOTE.
THEY DID NOT NEED THE VICE 
PRESIDENT TO PUT THEM OVER THE 
TOP IN THIS CASE.
JOE MAMPBLIN FROM WEST VIRGINIA,
A DEMOCRAT, OBVIOUSLY HELPING 
THEM TO GET THE 51 VOTES THEY 
NEEDED.
S
SO MUCH OF THIS WE HAVEN'T SEEN 
BEFORE LEADING UP TO THE NEXT 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
WE SAY MARY BRUCE, THIS NOMINEE 
DO A SITDOWN INTERVIEW WITH HIS 
WIFE.
WE SAW THE OP-ED IN THE WALL 
STREET JOURNAL IN THE 11th HOUR,
TALKING ABOUT HIS TEMPERAMENT 
AND SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS HE 
WAS TOO EMOTIONAL AT TIMES AND 
THAT OP-ED, THOUGH, IN A 
NATIONAL NEWSPAPER WAS LIKELY 
GEARS STRAIGHT TO THOSE FOUR 
SENATORS WHO WERE UNDECIDED.
WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN DELIBERATING
THIS ISSUE OF TEMPERAMENT THAT 
WAS RAISED.
IN ADDITION TO THESE ALLEGATIONS
THAT WERE RAISED AGAINST HIM BY 
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.
THEN THE DEBATE OVER 
TEMPERAMENT.
HOW HE DISPLAYED HIMSELF.
YOU CAN SEE THE OP-ED.
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN TOO EMOTIONAL 
AT TIMES.
I KNOW THAT MY TONE WAS SHARP.
>> REMARKABLE WAY TO HAVE A 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE DELIVER 
HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT HERE AND IT
WAS NOT JUST TO THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC.
VERY CLEAR AIMED AT THOSE 
UNDECIDED KEY SWING VOTES.
KAVANAUGH HITTING ON SOME OF 
THOSE CONCERNS.
HIS TONE, HIS CONCERNS ABOUT HIS
PARTISAN ATTACKS ON HIS 
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.
KAVANAUGH LAYING OUT IN THAT 
OP-ED TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF 
AND HIS TESTIMONY AND 
INTERESTINGLY MAKING THE 
ADMISSION THAT HE SAID THINGS 
THAT SHE -- HE SHOULD NOT HAVE 
SAID.
WHETHER THEY PLAYED ANY ROLE IN 
THEIR DECISIONMAKING HERE, THOSE
FOUR UNDECIDED.
THREE OF THEM SENATOR COLLINS, 
SENATOR FLAKE, SENATOR MANCHIN, 
NOW BEING A YES TO SUPPORT HIS 
CONFIRMATION.
IF THEY VOTE TOMORROW ON FINAL 
PASSAGE, JUDGE KAVANAUGH OF 
COURSE WILL BE CONFIRMED. 
>> NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.
IF IT'S AN INDICATOR OF WHAT'S 
TO COME TOMORROW, HE'LL BE THE 
NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
THE ONLY ONE VOTTO VOTE NO WAS 
SENATOR MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA.
EXTREMELY DIVIDED ON THIS CHOICE
FOR THE SUPREME COURT.
WE DID SAY, MARY WAS TALKING 
ABOUT THIS MOMENTS AGO, IN THAT 
OP-ED, HE WAS TALKING DIRECTLY 
TO THESE SENATORS, IN DOING SO 
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE
TEMPERAMENT HE DISPLAYED IN 
FRONT OF THAT SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE A WEEK AGO.
ABOUT HIS BEHAVIOR BACK IN HIS 
COLLEGE DAYS AND DURING HIS HIGH
SCHOOL YEARS.
WE SAW THAT MOMENT WHERE SENATOR
KLOBUCHAR ASKED HIM ABOUT 
WHETHER HE HAD EVER BLACKOUT AND
HE TURNED THE QUESTION AROUND 
AND SAID, I DON'T KNOW, HAVE 
YOU, SENATOR?
A MOMENT THAT PLAYED AGAIN AND 
AGAIN ON CABLE NEWS AND NEWS 
REPORT THAT FOLLOWED.
BROUGHT UP THIS QUESTION OF 
TEMPERAMENT.
TERRY, THIS WAS THE QUOTE IN HIS
OPENING STATEMENT.
THIS WAS NOT THE REACTION TO A 
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF HIM.
HE SAID THIS TWO-WEEK EFFORT HAS
BEEN CALCULATED POLITICAL HIT 
WITH APPARENT PENT-UP ANGER WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE 
CLINTONS.
AND YOU'RE A VETERAN OF THE 
COURT.
HAVE YOU HEARD A NOMINEE TALK IN
SUCH SHARP, PARTISAN TERMS.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
AN IMPORTANT POINT.
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS A WRITER.
HE WRITES AS A JUDGE.
NEVER AS PARTISAN AS WHAT 
KAVANAUGH SAID THERE.
WHAT JUSTICE JOHN PAUL STEPHENS 
WAS REMARKING ON.
THE ANGER AND THE TEARS, THOSE 
ARE UNDERSTANDABLE EMOTIONS FOR 
A MAN WHO WAS SAYING HE WAS 
FALSELY ACCUSED IN FRONT OF HIS 
FAMILY AND THE WORLD AND THAT 
WAS INCREDIBLY PAINFUL.
ANGER AND TEARS WERE A NATURAL 
REACTION TO THAT.
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS A LOYAL, 
PARTISAN REPUBLICAN LAWYER FOR 
KEN STARR IN THE FLORIDA 
ELECTION CONTEST AND THE 
BUSH/GORE ELECTION IN THE BUSH 
WHITE HOUSE.
I THINK PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED 
ABOUT WHAT WAS REVEALED ABOUT 
HIS PARTISANSHIP.
NOT AS MUCH ABOUT THE EMOTIONS. 
>> TERRY MORAN STAY WITH US. 
>>> WE'RE ON THE AIR WITH 
BREAKING NEWS OF THE CRUCIAL 
VOTE INVOLVING SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH.
11:00 A.M. EASTERN.
MOMENT AGO ON THE SENATE FLOOR, 
THIS MOMENT WAS CRUCIAL IN 
PUSHING BRETT KAVANAUGH CLOSER 
TO THAT POST ON THE SUPREME 
COURT.
>> THANK YOU.
ON THIS VOTE, THE AYES ARE 51.
THE NOES ARE 49.
THE MOTION IS AGREED TO.
>> YOU HEARD THE GAVEL THERE.
JUST MOMENTS AGO.
51 VOTES TO NOW LIMIT THIS 
DEBATE.
OF COURSE, SENATORS CAN CHANGE 
THEIR VOTE BETWEEN TODAY AND THE
FINAL VOTE WHICH COULD COME AS 
EARLY AS TOMORROW.
IT'S RARE THAT THAT ACTUALLY 
HAPPENS.
SENATOR JOE MANCHIN, A DEMOCRAT 
FROM WEST VIRGINIA, HELPING THEM
GET THOSE 51 VOTES.
THE ONLY DEMOCRAT TO VOTE "YES" 
TO PUSH THIS NOMINEE FORWARD TO 
THE SUPREME COURT.
OF THE FOUR UNDECIDED SENATORS 
WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING, ONLY ONE 
VOTED NO.
SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI, 
REPUBLICAN SENATOR OF ALASKA WHO
VOTED NO.
SHE HAS HEARD FROM SURVIVORS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT.
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT SHE MET 
WITH SOME IN HER OFFICE JUST 
YESTERDAY.
SO MANY OF THOSE POIGNANT 
MOMENTS.
WE SAW JEFF FLAKE IN THE 
ELEVATOR JUST BEFORE THE 
HEARINGS LAST WEEK.
WHERE SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT APPROACHED HIM IN THE 
ELEVATOR, ONE OF THE WOMEN 
SAYING, LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M 
TALKING WITH YOU.
IT'S WIDELY BELIEVED THAT LED 
SENATOR JEFF FLAKE AND HIS 
COLLEAGUES ON THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, HE THEN 
JOINED DEMOCRATS IN PUSHING FOR 
THIS ONE-WEEK PAUSE.
HE AND SENATOR CHRIS COONS 
SUGGESTING THAT.
JEFF FLAKE GOING ALONG WITH THAT
IDEA.
REALLY CHANGED THE COURSE OF 
THIS WHOLE PROCESS.
MANY REPUBLICANS HAVE COME OUT 
TO SAY THAT THEY BELIEVE THE FBI
INVESTIGATION NOT ONLY WAS 
THOROUGH AND COMPLETE BUT DID 
NOT OFFER ANY CORROBORATING 
EVIDENCE TO DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY
FORD'S TESTIMONY.
THE ARGUMENT FROM DEMOCRATS, 
SOME CALLING THIS A SHAM, SAYING
MANY OF THE NAMES THAT WERE PUT 
FORWARD WHO HAVE CORROBORATED 
DR. FORD'S TESTIMONY AND THE 
TESTIMONY OF DEBBIE RAMIREZ, SHE
TALKED WITH THE FBI, MANY OF THE
NAMES PUT FORWARD THAT COULD 
BACK UP THEIR STORIES WERE 
SIMPLY NOT REACHED OUT BY THE 
FBI.
ULTIMATELY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHETHER OR NOT THE WHITE HOUSE 
CONTROLLED WHO THEY COULD TALK 
TO AND WHY THIS WAS TEN OR SO 
PEOPLE WHO WERE REACHED BY THE 
FBI AND WHY THAT NUMBER WASN'T 
GREATER THAN THAT.
THAT WILL BE SOMETHING DEBATED 
FOR SOME TIME TO COME.
THE TWEET THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF
THE SCREEN, VERY PROUD OF THE 
U.S. SENATE FOR VOTING "YES" TO 
ADVANCE THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH.
DEBATE CAN STILL CONTINUE BUT 
THIS CERTAINLY MINIMIZES THIS.
THE FINAL VOTE COULD COME AS 
EARLY AS TOMORROW.
STRONG INDICATORS TODAY, THIS 
VERY WELL MEANS THAT JUDGE BRETT
KAVANAUGH COULD BE THE NEXT 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.
IT WOULD BE AN HISTORIC SHIFT 
FOR THE COURT.
HE WOULD OCCUPY THAT SWING SEAT.
THE COURT WOULD THEN LEAN 
CONSERVATIVE LIKELY FOR 
GENERATIONS TO COME.
THE OTHER QUESTION HERE, COKIE, 
IS ABOUT HOW WOMEN AROUND THIS 
COUNTRY ARE SEEING THIS VOTE 
HERE THIS MORNING, NOT JUST 
WOMEN, MEN, MANY MEN WHO HAVE 
SURVIVED SEXUAL ASSAULT AS WELL.
THE WOMEN WHO CAME TO THE 
CAPITOL.
THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THIS 
COUNTRY TO TRY AND INFLUENCE 
SOME OF THOSE SENATORS WHO WERE 
UNDECIDED.
SOME OF THOSE FOUR.
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE THEY'RE 
RECEIVING THIS?
>> VERY STARK AND EMOTIONAL 
REACTIONS TO THIS.
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN SEEING
ANY WAY EVEN BEFORE THIS VERY 
CONTENTIOUS HEARING, A BIG GAP 
BETWEEN THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE 
REACTING TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
OF COURSE, IT'S NOT AS BIG AS 
THE PARTISAN GAP WITH 
REPUBLICANS SUPPORTING HIM AND 
THE DEMOCRATS NOT SUPPORTING 
HIM.
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A REACTION 
TO THIS.
IT'S NOT FAIR FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF 
ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN 
SEXUALLY HARASSED IN HISTORY BUT
THAT'S PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN 
GOING ON HERE.
AND AGAIN, HIS RESPONSE TO IT 
EXACERBATED IT.
FOR WOMEN AND THE ELECTION AND 
ALL OF THAT, WE HAVE REAL 
PROBLEMS NOW WITH TWO OF OUR 
MAJOR INSTITUTIONS OF 
GOVERNMENT.
YOU HAVE A MAN WHO'S VERY LIKELY
TO JOIN THE SUPREME COURT, WHO 
DESPITE HIS OP-ED IN THE WALL 
STREET JOURNAL TODAY SAYING HE 
WOULD BE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL 
JUDGE, TESTIFIED IN A VERY, VERY
PARTISAN FASHION BEFORE THE 
SENATE.
AND YOU HAVE A SENATE THAT IS SO
DIVIDED THAT THE -- AS WE HAVE 
SAID EARLIER, ONE DEMOCRATIC 
VOTE FOR KAVANAUGH.
ONE REPUBLICAN VOTE ESSENTIALLY 
AGAINST HIM.
YOU KNOW, THROUGHOUT MUCH OF OUR
HISTORY, THEY DIDN'T CALL THE 
ROLL.
THEY SAID FINE.
THAT'S GONE.
THE SPEECHES WE HEARD TODAY 
LEADING UP TO THIS VOTE, FROM 
THE LEADERS OF THE SENATE, THE 
TWO LEADERS OF THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE AND THEN THE TWO 
LEADERS OF THE SENATE, CHUCK 
SCHUMER AND MITCH McCONNELL WERE
SO PARTISAN AGAINST EACH OTHER 
AND ACCUSING HARD RIGHT AND HARD
LEFT GROUPS OF INFLUENCING THE 
MEMBERS.
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY HARD
FOR THE SENATE TO COME BACK FROM
THIS NOMINATION IN A WAY THAT 
THEY CAN COOPERATE WITH EACH 
OTHER AND IT'S GOING TO BE VERY,
VERY HARD FOR THE COURT.
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
CERTAIN CLOUD OVER THEM.
>> SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT, 
COKIE.
>> TERRY, IT'S SO TRUE WE 
HAVEN'T HEARD THE PARTISAN 
RHETORIC WHEN IT COMES TO A 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE USED BY 
THAT NOMINEE HIMSELF LET ALONE 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.
WE HEARD FROM CHUCK GRASSLEY 
THIS MORNING.
THEN, DIANNE FEINSTEIN.
CLEARLY THE PARTISAN LINES 
DRAWN.
YOU WOULD EXPECT THAT MOMENT IN 
OUR COUNTRY FROM THE SENATE AND 
CERTAINLY FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, 
BUT THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF HAS
BEEN SOMEWHAT INSULATED FROM 
THAT FOR SO MANY YEARS, I'M SO 
CURIOUS WHAT THE JUSTICES ON THE
COURT THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY 
WITNESSED OVER THE COURSE OF THE
LAST WEEK OR TWO?
>> Reporter: THAT'S A GREAT 
QUESTION, DAVID.
THEY DREAD WHAT'S HAPPENING.
HOWEVER THEY FEEL ABOUT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH.
THIS PLACE STILL HAS A VERY 
ESTIMATION IN THE OPINION OF 
MOST AMERICANS.
THEY RESPECT THE SUPREME COURT 
FOR THE MOST PART.
IT'S DAMAGED ITSELF IN RECENT 
YEARS WITH A COUPLE OF RULINGS 
IN OUR PARTISAN TIMES.
BUT YOU NOTICED THAT THE SUPREME
COURT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WAY OF 
ENFORCING ITS OPINIONS, EXCEPT 
ITS OWN LEGITIMACY IN THE HEARTS
OF AMERICANS.
CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS IS AN
INSTITUTIONALIST.
HE HAS PRACTICED HERE FOR 30 
YEARS.
HE LOVES THIS INSTITUTION.
I KNOW WHATEVER HE THINKS ABOUT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH HE'LL BE 
CONCERNED GOING FORWARD, HOW DO 
I PROTECT THAT REPUTATION, THE 
TRUE SOURCE OF THE COURT'S 
AUTHORITY. 
>> TERRY, OUR THANKS TO YOU 
AGAIN.
>>> MARY BRUCE, SOME INTERESTING
COLOR COMING IN TO US FROM THE 
CHAMBER.
SENATORS COLLINS AND MURKOWSKI 
WHO HAD BEEN SIDE BY SIDE 
THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THESE 
PROCEEDINGS WERE GREETED RIGHT 
AFTER THE VOTE.
SENATORS COMING OVER TO SHAKE 
THEIR HANDS.
OBVIOUSLY, THE TWO WOMEN VOTED 
DIFFERENTLY. 
>> Reporter: YEAH, THEY'RE 
REPORTING A THEY WERE GREETED BY
BOTH PARTIES LIKE CELEBRITIES.
DEMOCRATS COMING OVER TO SHAKE 
LISA MURKOWSKI'S HAND.
THE REPUBLICAN FROM ALASKA WHO 
JOINED DEMOCRATS ON VOTING NO 
FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
AND SUSAN COLLINS HAS BEEN 
WRESTLING WITH THIS DECISION, 
SHE HAS BEEN MEETING WITH 
CONSTITUENTS IN HER OFFICE 
TRYING TO WRESTLE WITH WHAT SHE 
WAS GOING TO DO.
TODAY, JOINING HER PARTY IN 
SUPPORTING BRETT KAVANAUGH.
>> JON KARL, 51 VOTES TO 
MINIMIZE THE DEBATE AS WE MOVE 
FORWARD AND MOVE CLOSER TO THAT 
FINAL VOTE ON BRETT KAVANAUGH.
IT'S LOOKING CLEARER BY THE 
MOMENT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
COULD BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE.
