Hi Guys, I'ts vlogmas Day 23

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,400
One of the most exciting parts of the holiday
season, for me, was snow.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,539
In Wisconsin, we used to get buckets of it,
and nothing made me happier.

4
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:18,080
Snow angel-ing, building forts and snowmen,
going sledding are some of the absolute biggest

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,840
joys of my entire  childhood.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,740
I actually used to love snow so much that
I would pray, to Jesus, and also  Santa,

7
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,360
for more snow starting around October every
year.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,870
When Harry Potter books started coming out
and we all wanted to be little witches and

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,880
wizards I used to try and figure out like spells to bring the white stuff.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,040
Like, I remember mixing up glitter and ice
cubes in a cup and dumping it all over my backyard

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,460
thinking that the sky would open up and start
flurrying 

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,640
Why are kids so weird?

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,240
And the few years we didn’t get any snow
left me so devastated. My brother and I would

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,870
cut out paper snowflakes and tape them to
the windows of our house

15
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,640
And then on Christmas morning we'd get our parents up before

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,439
sunrise to open presents so we couldn’t
look outside to see that there was only dead,

17
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,170
brown grass.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,810
And this year, it’s not looking like we’ll
have any Christmas snow, so it looks like

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,670
we’ll be doing the same thing.

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:26,980
♪I'm dreaming of a white christmas♪

21
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:35,980
♪Just like the one's I used to know♪

22
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:42,140
♪Where the treetops glisten, and children listen♪

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:55,880
♪and children listen to hear sleighbells in the snow♪

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,880
So tell me in comments—does it
snow where you live this time of year? Is

25
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,800
snow something you enjoy or loathe, is it
even Christmas without it?

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,033
Cause I'd say maybe not

27
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:11,213
