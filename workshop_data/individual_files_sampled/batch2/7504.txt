way back in 2015 when Donald Trump was just candidate Trump there were some concerns about his health and his age and if you look at him he looks like he's pretty overweight and obviously is on the older age older age are part of the Skepta a spectrum for age so to alleviate some of those concerns he released a letter from his doctor we were told describing in extremely a trumpian language in detail his Captain America esque physique let's bring up the letter to show you some of the highlights if you don't recall this small text I apologize but it points out that his lab results were astonishingly excellent by the way it starts to whom my concern my concern that should have been your first tip I think that is pointing out without meaning to that Bornstein is concerned but anyway over 39 years mr. Trump has had no significant medical problems well that is just amazing despite that despite the fact that he was already an amazing health he found a way to lose 15 pounds over the past 12 months his physical strength and stamina are extraordinary let's see suffered no cancer well that's actually good and probably true he has no history of ever using alcohol or tobacco products he does not urinate nor defecate his body makes perfect use of everything you put into it and he will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency screw JFK screw Lincoln who was I think a wrestler and a boxer no this overweight TV watch and man will be the healthiest person well Barack Obama used to smoke and play basketball that's where you got you know what I mean that's healthy yes healthy when you like yeah I'm smoking on the basketball court you want to keep in perfect balance it's about it you're showboating when you hit the jumper while you're taking it you know you drop the stick so Court but so I guess the the reason we're coming back to this is I mean you knew you knew and you first read that right Donald Trump wrote that Donald Trump did write that so how the Bernstein of the doctor now says he dictated that whole letter I didn't write that letter I just made it up as I went on that's black humor that letter that's my sense of humor it's like the movie Fargo it takes the truth and moves it in a different direction like the movie Fargo or this administration you don't want to take the truth go in a different direction no I really think after you know being reminded of this letter the presidency is the only thing that kept Trump out of the Avengers infinity war because this man I mean astonish Lee excellent laboratory test physical strength and stamina are extraordinary and he can lift Thor's hammer if anyone's curious he can lift Thor's hammer going for him it's it really is and by the way PS mr. Trump can lift Thor's Hammer's that's Rosen in a statue of Hillary when I get my physical done I'm telling my doctor listen you gotta step it up you got us I want to have the bestest blood pressure ever yeah I think that should be good and the best of the best description I've ever heard oh is probably diabetic I want to glowy I want a glowing cross yeah yeah yeah yeah he absorbs gamma radiations across they just close so look this is obviously funny but some of you might be thinking like come on is this we're first of all we sort of knew does this really matter but but I think that this actually does matter for a couple of different reasons I mean first of all I don't think that you're wrong to be worried about the potential health of a president I mean you can take it too far and spread conspiracy theories about Hillary's Parkinson's and she was supposed to die like a year and half ago but she was good so you can take this too far and certainly being in poor health like if it if they revealed that Trump was obese that doesn't mean he doesn't get to be President or anything like that but people might want to know so there's that but then much more importantly this is a person who will pressure his longtime employees to lie about him to fool people and so if they'll do that with this guy what'd he do it with Ronnie Jackson would he do it with his lawyers would he do it with people in his cabinet like can you trust statements that are coming out for instance a while back he tweeted about Michael Flynn and the reason he gave for why he fired Michael think did not fit in with what he had previously said and it potentially exposed him to liability from the ongoing investigation so the next day they said he didn't tweet that his lawyer tweeted that first of all I don't think Donald Trump would let someone else tweet on his account for the most part certainly not like a lawyer but he said it do we have any reason believe that's true if he's getting doctors to lie about him and say that they wrote something when it was really him I want us to be concerning I think we have evidence sort of chapter and verse that he pressures people under him to do things to drop investigations we have the whole Comey conversation you know during which their contemporary and contemporary knows contemporaneous notes on just the thing you're talking about so we know that that's the case but I think the other aspect to this and it is funny because the doctor himself is so funny everything's so cartoonish in this I mean the wording of the letter is weird and wrong and they're misspelling something but that aside you'll remember in the run-up to the presidential the presidential election during that run up they made a big deal out of Hillary's he'll you alluded to it they suggested that she was of failing health to the point that she might not even be able to complete her term if she did become president he made a big deal out of her stamina and the media really they were co-opted by that narrative they they ask questions about Hillary's health and meanwhile they pretty much let Trump skate on what as I said is a sort of a cartoonish letter yeah so I think it's until I was no fan of Hillary Clinton we all sort of on agreement in terms of what what we were feeling as the as the election drew near but I was trying to say in relation to this is that this takes on a much more serious tone when you consider the damage done to Hillary suggesting that she was not in good health can you imagine if Hillary had gotten her doctor to release exactly this like like she has Olympic level stamina and strength like she'll do cartwheels it'll blow your mind I mean this is an exit to me this is just an example of Trump lies about everything that's what's comical about it like this is this is something like you said you didn't need to lie about and you're right they made it a big deal with Hillary's camp you know the the ridiculousness of her being in bad health because she coughed you know which means she was gonna die any moment but when you look at this and and this is what's comical about it so it says here that when they raided the doctor's office and they took everything from trouble they took away propecia a medication that promotes hair growth but we know if propecia offered Donald Trump money to do a commercial for him he would have done it you know what I mean it's like it don't let them know I take it oh wait they want to pay me to take it so to me that's just the example but again and and what you said and also we were talking off screen about Michelle wolf what she talked about this is where the media plays along with Trump none of them would challenge Trump Trump makes this ridiculous lies about his health but it sounds good it's good TV it's good for ratings so they're fine with it Hillary they go after like it's real news you know I mean so so just like Michelle Wolf said where where the media sees like clickbait right we can get we can get more clicks by saying Trump is an astonishing health or then they're fine when they don't question it half this is this is ridiculous nobody gets this kind of like you said Captain America would be the only one who can get this kind of health report and this is a reminder then of the past that the media gave Donald Trump the media bears immense responsibility for having given Donald Trump a pass this is just one place they gave him a pass you got to pass a lot of other places too how can a guy who's completely vacuous and incompetent get to the presidency because the media is a co-conspirator I just want to add one more thing first of all thank you for mentioning the raid I guess I didn't actually mention that though Trump's bodyguard and two other people raided his doctor's office and took all the materials they had on Trump that seems like that should be more more news than it is exactly is a co-conspirator right now I'm co-conspirator I didn't save a lot so had to bring it up your co-conspirator number one I'm just visiting thank you yeah thank you but wait one other thing I want to add because obviously I mean we've pointed out that this is basically the origin story for a super hero there was one other thing Harold Bernstein said he said Trump dictated the letter and I would tell him what he couldn't put in there they came to pick up the letter at 4 o'clock or something so what this implies is that that ridiculous letter isn't as bad as Trump wanted it to be truck tried to push farther an airborne Stein who was legitimate crazy person himself actually drew the line somewhere god only knows what it was he can spit webs his wrists or something then fly like a graceful swan punch that's what we got I'm sorry but getting back to the media this this is where the media plays along after to talk about the raid on the doctor's office Trump's bodyguard and his people blah blah blah White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told The Boston Globe that the alleged rate of borne scenes office was standard procedure for a newly elected president and then it goes away so when Barack Obama was elected he sent his bodyguards too you know raid his doctor's office George W Bush like it's what presidents do right after you get elected you just send him out let's let's raid the doctors of like that but the fact that she could just say that with a straight face and no one raised their hands that excuse me that's ridiculous like nobody challenges her when she says something so utterly ridiculous except michelle wolf breath how dare is a liar well but but this is an important point Alonso's making about this raid because if you sent a bunch of goons into your doctor's office and grabbed all of your files you'd be arrested for that but you call the police right you can't just send people over there's no warrant there's no subpoena there's nothing there are just a bunch of big dudes in suits who go in and clean the doctor's office out well if someone who's played a big dude in suits in numerous movies well numerous but but no but I mean you can do that right I am imagine if you're an executive and you send an assistant to pick up your records from a doctor's office that's probably legal but when you're the President and you send someone to pick up your your records from a doctor's office because you don't want anyone to see them that's a little suspicious so the thing about them being big guys or whatever they look like isn't important any and it may be legal there are your medical records but I think the press should be somewhat interested in why did you grab everything from this doctor's office including like propecia which is like we've seen your hair we know you've been trying to grow something up there yeah and if you're in the media and you don't find that to be odd if it had come out that Hillary Clinton had set her bodyguards to take all of her medical materials one dark night
