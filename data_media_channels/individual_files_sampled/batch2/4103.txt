Donald Trump spent last week on the defensive and he partly caved over his border policy tonight he is clearly eager to turn the corner so let me tell you exactly what's happening your president is advocating a blatantly unconstitutional proposal to literally gut due process inside the United States now from a legal perspective the good news tonight is due process not a choice for politicians this is not Donald Trump's call it's a right secure in the fifth amendment of the Constitution of course and it's upheld by judges and independent branch of the United States government so Trump has raised a new topic that actually underscores the limits on his own power and maybe the limits on his knowledge because it's one thing to say you want to get tougher on the border and another to propose things that are so unconstitutional that basically everyone knows including your allies in Congress you can't do the thing you're talking about they said we'd like to hire 5,000 more judges 5,000 you ever hear of a thing like that judges we want a system where when people come in illegally they have to go out and a nice simple system that works you know they want to hire now 5,000 more judges so that a person puts the toe on the land that we have to go to trial this is crazy what we're doing I don't want judges I want Border Patrol I want ice the president doesn't want judges that sound you hear is the sound of no one caring nobody because under our Constitution presidents do not pick the other branches of government so tonight I can tell you as a legal matter no one cares if Donald Trump wants or doesn't want judges now if you put aside the actual rhetoric coming from the White House and even try to consider a more technical version of this argument because people are going to be talking about it you can say okay do people trying to immigrate to the United States get the same due process as Americans even if that's not the president's called is there too much due process for migrants and the short answer tonight is no the part of the government that does make this call the courts has ruled many times that even when the US does deny entry to humans or Deportes them from the border which the US can choose to do they are still entitled to human rights the Supreme Court upheld that in the 1800s and in 1953 and as recently as 1982 so keep those legal facts in mind when you watch the White House spokesperson today struggle to defend Trump's legal fictions it makes no sense that an illegal alien sets one foot on American soil and then they would go through a three to five year judicial process to be removed from the country thousands of illegal aliens are removed every month without seeing an immigration judge just because you don't see a judge doesn't mean you aren't receiving due process that's the scene in Washington and while it may be comforting the Trump cannot eliminate due process any more than he could implement the original travel ban after the courts blocked it the administration's focus on this sideshow occurs instead of more pressing duties like we're uniting the families split under trumps now partially discontinued policy updates on that tonight where parents are being told that they can see their kids again if they agree immediately to deportation one parent saying they signed that paperwork out of desperation to see his six-year-old child but adding the truth is I can't go back to Honduras I need help another deported father has only been able to talk to his six-year-old daughter who's trapped somewhere in the US I'm joined now by criminal defense attorney and a former prosecutor ambrosial Rodriguez and NBC's Jacob Soboroff who as you know has been reporting this immigration crisis in Texas and has covered the border for us at MSNBC for quite some time I start with you as an attorney your view of Donald Trump saying things that underscore his own irrelevance because he doesn't decide how many judges there are and how this operates against the backdrop of all the pressing work that there is to be done all right I mean it's kind of road it goes for him and take this point of view I don't really don't think he knows what due process is and how it works the fact you think this comes more from ignorance than anything else right I mean not just ignorance but everything we've seen from this president which is ignorance on top of racism on top of race baiting and using these poor people who I mean we're talking about a very small group of immigrants that are coming from three specific countries that have been worn torn I mean I have clients from these from this part of the world and what they have to deal with is it truly awful so I think what the president has done is made a statement that has all of us talking about what the rights should be for the people involved and there's no getting around the fact that under our Constitution once you step into the country there are certain rights and a certain due process that they have you were speaking here to a Border Patrol chief in the Rio Grande let's look at that Jacob are you trying to deter people from coming by separating children and their parents and prosecuting another percent of people who come here yes if we do not do anything we are going to be in a crisis moment so separating parents and kids is to put consequences on them coming here together yes yes so I mean if Donald Trump cared about the rights of people he wouldn't have put a policy into place designed tear families apart and rip apart the asylum rights of tens of thousands of people that come to the United States on a regular basis this whole thing was done without any care in mind for the rights of people whether it is due process or asylum you're the attorney I'm not the attorney but I saw what it looks like on the ground when you don't care about the rights of people it looks like children sitting in cages by themselves ripped apart from their parents and their parents at this point maybe as many as the parents of all 2053 kids that are left in the custody of HHS could be deported and for all we know according to a DHS official may never see their their kids or their parents again right and that's that's the human side of this and why there's such outrage still going and around the nation you mentioned being an attorney I mean this is a crash course in a kind of law school for the nation but not the good kind because everyone's sitting around there take their dining room table talking about how this works and it is understandable that some people feel given the problems we have in this country given the poverty given everything that we owe our own citizens the question does come up well what do we owe other people and yet this is a constitutional democracy that has due process I want to play again Sarah how could be Sanders on the judges thing it is good to have judges overseeing this process because it ensures that it is fair and a lot of people do get deported we know that the the notion that the president and his people in the White House are spending today talking about well maybe we don't want judges is is is chilling even though they don't have the power take a listen it was proposed to add 5,000 judges I've seen 750 is a number of different proposals quite a few that we've seen we've laid out what we would like to see and hopefully Congress will work with us to make that happen walk us through how this is supposed to work when you have judges involved in the asylum and Vorta process thank you look first of all I want the viewers to know that we're talking about immigration judges that's not federal district judges and Asylum judges or immigration judges or employees of the Department of Justice so which Trump is in charge of if he hired the number of judges or lawyers necessary Department of Justice makes them immigration lawyers this is an administrative process this isn't a long trial in an immigration hearing right here well you make it let's be clear so you're making a subtle distinction here which is the Constitution says people have rights and that includes non-citizens in the same way that they have a right to be free from torture they have a right to due process you're pointing out that the way this is executed through American law is that you have these immigration judges that are set aside to do that which is different and in many ways shorter and leaner than what Americans think of as a full trial for an American citizen correct because immigration is a privilege not a right therefore the same kind of rights that you have in a criminal trial don't apply an immigration hearing which is an administrative hearing which by the way the person seeking asylum has all of the burden they have to prove their case and based on what you just said do you think Donald Trump knows what you're talking about or not I think this president has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he doesn't understand how our government works both of you stay with me what I want to do is is turn to a very important guest here in California there are 10 state attorneys general who are now suing Trump over the family separation policy California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is helping lead this suit claiming Trump's policy is both inhumane and draconian thank you for joining me at a busy time as you work on this case first question out of the gate even if someone agrees with you about the criticism of the policy what do you say to the more narrow argument that well Trump partly back down last week why do you need to sue because his executive action action arey was incomplete it was incomprehensible and therefore probably doesn't work right we have no sense of what will happen to these children where they will go how long it will last and so like many of the things that this administration has done they don't really think through them in a logical way and so we're we're filing suit to defend the constitutional rights of these families and certainly of these children no child should be put in a child interment camp you are suing the Trump administration but you've also been out in the front here against Attorney General Sessions your counterpart at the federal level and he's blasted back at you take a look so California absolutely appears to me is using every power it has powers it doesn't have to frustrate federal law enforcement so you can be sure I'm going to use every power I have to stop that as you understand he is alleging that California as a legal process which you lead are somehow out in excess of your state authority and that he's gonna push back your response sir we're gonna do what we need to do in California we believe in upholding the law including federal law and the Constitution and that's exactly what we're doing I think AG sessions had at least one part right and that is that we're using every power we have under the law and we will defend ourselves where we need to and we will file action to protect our people where we must so far we've had a whole lot more victories and we've seen any kind of defeat in going up against the Trump administration and that's principally because I think the courts are showing us that no one including the occupant in the Oval Office is above the law you say no one's above the law this goes to a very interesting point would you understand I think viewers have gathered the immigration power is second probably only to the war-making power for an area where the chief executive gets wide wide latitude traditionally in the courts as you know and yet in the travel ban and now on sanctuary cities and then the border separation policy we've seen this president even with that wide latitude appear to go beyond it what does it tell you what do you think is the significance of the fact that this president Donald Trump seems to get into so much trouble when he goes and tries to do things on immigration and do you think that's a product as we were discussing before you joined us of ignorance or of some actual malign intent I think it's a it's a Cavalier way of trying to make policy and execute the laws and they are running into the Constitution we don't have the right in California to issue immigration laws we respect the federal government's right to enforce immigration laws but we have a right to enforce the Federal Constitution when the federal government and the Trump administration try to execute laws in a way that violate people's constitutional rights that's why we've been able to have victories against them on any number of issues whether it was the daca dreamers where we stopped the Trump administration from canceling the daca program or in the victories we've had so far at protecting our state's right to determine how we use our law enforcement authority and not allow the federal government to believe they can commandeer us into doing what they want by holding hostage our federal funds that we should get here in the state of California and final question sir when the president says that maybe we should do this without judges is that unconstitutional in your view it's it's also immoral it's also wrongheaded but it's it's also against the law and a violation of due process so on any number of grounds what Donald Trump is saying is not going to happen at least not so long as our institutions stand up to this type of Cavalier rogue activity of the occupant of the White House I guess I should also close by apologizing because I know you to be a seasoned litigator so it's somewhat embarrassing that as part of my job as a journalist I have to ask you whether the Fifth Amendment exists or not you know I guess that's where we are attorney general Becerra thank you sir thank you very much appreciate it I turn back to the panel your response to what the Attorney General says there and what he's doing these state AG's stepping up to try to actually put a line in the sand so that if Donald Trump decided again tomorrow to change his executive order because he can go back and forth that they would try to get a ruling here locking this in well first of all I want to thank change no Becerra as a lawyer he's doing a great job and just kind of defending our rights and kind of standing up to this administration I also want to say I think it's very important there is no immigration crisis this is like this has been completely created by Trump in order to gin up his base if we look at the numbers that is the people trying to come across the country without documentation or the two thousand three thousand people that have been stopped in what this crisis has been going on for last two weeks this has been created in order to gin up his base and what we're dealing with now is that we have an administration that's using the the least of these are people who are escaping civil wars gangs and really horrible conditions but you're speaking about about the asylum context and the overall data but it is also true that the United States has a long border and there is undocumented immigration right I mean that's not that's whether we call that a crisis I guess is a question but there is an undocumented immigration challenge for law enforcement here there is and there always will be in the United States as long as employers don't have to verify or don't have a system where they are held responsible for hiring people that don't have documentation I mean that's really the one thing that both Republican and Democrats have in common when it comes to immigration they don't hold the corporations accountable only the poor people that get them to work you're talking about the dual party systems entrench hypocrisy visa vie corporate America I am familiar with that thing they have in common Jacob I wonder why the lenss condition of doing so much reporting on this let's step back we talked to law we talked the lawsuits what have you seen out there over these past months on a story that started I think in one place where Republicans said this is a winner for them to the past several weeks where it does seem there's to be a sea change I would I hope what I think is that the America's starting to understand the difference between the perception of what happens on the border in Washington DC and the reality of what happens on the border the reality is you are absolutely correct there is no crisis on the border undocumented immigration apprehensions along the southern border are as low I think as they have been since since the 1970s it's an unbelievable thing to hear the president talk about violence coming across the southern border drugs flowing across the southern border and use that as a justification for ripping apart families and putting children in prison cells when the AG and attorney general Becerra said as a journalist that's fascinating to hear him talk about these lawsuits we don't know where these kids are gonna go next I want to see where these lawsuits go because from the state of California from the ACLU I don't know at this point we know kids aren't going in cages anymore but we don't know where favors are going are they going to be indefinitely detained at this point by ice do they have to let these families out and go after 20 days well your and you're putting your finger out such an important part of this which is many of the parents particularly those who sign the detention orders we were just reporting on for deportation have little to no standing to get their kids back that's exactly seamed we've seen senators held at the doorway of these institutions you and other journalists have been trying to report it out if these cases go forward the one we're reporting on tonight that creates an additional leverage point and standing to keep an eye on this and to see about the humanitarian part of it briefly before we go I'm just going to say could change the game as they say I mean it really could change what ultimately happens with these people and as we know right now two thousand fifty three young kids are sitting in detention tonight in HHS custody the questions before were where the girls were the toddlers those questions still apply but the next question is where's everybody going next we don't know the answer tonight hey I'm already Melvin from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our YouTube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
