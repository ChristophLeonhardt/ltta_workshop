1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:02,958
HIS SPEECH 20 MINUTES AGO AND

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:04,426
DAVID, BEGIN WITH YOU.

3
00:00:04,427 --> 00:00:05,827
WHAT IS YOUR EXPECTATION NOW AS

4
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:06,995
WE AWAIT A FINAL VOTE?

5
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:08,397
>> THERE ARE TWO SENATORS YOU

6
00:00:08,398 --> 00:00:09,097
LOOK AT.

7
00:00:09,098 --> 00:00:10,732
ONE IS A DEMOCRAT WHO VOTED YES

8
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:13,769
ON MOVING THE VOTE AND THAT'S

9
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,369
MR. MANCHIN.

10
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,104
APPARENTLY HE HEARD A LOT FROM

11
00:00:16,105 --> 00:00:17,005
HIS CONSTITUENTS IN WEST

12
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:17,372
VIRGINIA.

13
00:00:17,373 --> 00:00:21,243
HE IS IN A VERY HEAVY PRO-TRUMP

14
00:00:21,244 --> 00:00:23,345
STATE OVER 40% OF HIS

15
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:24,279
CONSTITUENTS VOTED FOR DONALD

16
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,647
TRUMP IN THE LAST ELECTION.

17
00:00:25,648 --> 00:00:27,849
SO HE IS REALLY IN THE

18
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,216
SPOTLIGHT.

19
00:00:28,217 --> 00:00:29,418
HE VOTED YES TODAY.

20
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:31,053
HE COULD VOTE NO TOMORROW ON

21
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:35,424
THE FINAL VOTE BUT THEN YOU

22
00:00:35,425 --> 00:00:37,893
HAVE MS. MURCOWSKI WHO VOTED NO

23
00:00:37,894 --> 00:00:38,226
TODAY.

24
00:00:38,227 --> 00:00:39,394
IS IT CONCEIVABLE YOU COULD

25
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,296
VOTE NO ON A MOVE FOR THE VOTE

26
00:00:41,297 --> 00:00:43,632
ON THE CLOTURE MOVE AND VOTE

27
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:44,132
YES TOMORROW?

28
00:00:44,133 --> 00:00:47,869
THAT'S RARELY, IF EVER DONE.

29
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,538
MAYBE ED HENRY WHO KNOW MORE

30
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:50,038
ABOUT THE HISTORY.

31
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,541
WHAT IS SHE GOING TO HEAR FROM

32
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:53,809
HER CONSTITUENTS IN ALASKA

33
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,710
BETWEEN NOW AND TOMORROW AT THE

34
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:56,511
TIME OF THE VOTE?

35
00:00:56,512 --> 00:00:59,448
WILL SHE CHANGE FROM A NO TODAY

36
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:01,149
TO A YES ON KAVANAUGH TOMORROW?

37
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,983
AN OPEN QUESTION.

38
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:03,518
>> Sandra: WHAT ABOUT THAT, ED?

39
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,289
>> I CAN'T THINK OF A CASE IN A

40
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,423
HIGH PROFILE SITUATION WHERE

41
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,592
YOU VOTE NO NOW AND THEN YES

42
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:11,727
SOMEHOW FOR FINAL PASSAGE.

43
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,496
I THINK DAVID IS RIGHT THAT

44
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:15,731
MURCOWSKI IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO

45
00:01:15,732 --> 00:01:16,765
BE YES FOR KAVANAUGH.

46
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:17,866
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

47
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:21,002
HERE IS THE MATH.

48
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:22,938
IF MURCOWSKI STAYS NO TOMORROW

49
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:24,539
AND MANCHIN POTENTIALLY SPLITS

50
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,707
THIS AND SAYS TO ITS

51
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:26,508
CONSTITUENTS LOOK I VOTED YES

52
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:27,976
TO MOVE IT FORWARD.

53
00:01:27,977 --> 00:01:29,244
I DON'T LIKE THE DIVISION IN

54
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:29,611
WASHINGTON

55
00:01:29,612 --> 00:01:31,813
I WANT TO GIVE THE MAN A VOTE.

56
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:35,117
BUT POTENTIALLY VOTES NO IN

57
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:36,518
FINAL PASSAGE TO APPEASE

58
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:36,885
DEMOCRATS.

59
00:01:36,886 --> 00:01:38,887
LET'S ASSUME THAT FOR A MOMENT

60
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:43,358
AND COLLINS AND FLAKE, WHO BOTH

61
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:45,026
VOTED AYE TO MOVE IT FORWARD.

62
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,229
IF THEY HOLD ON FINAL PASSAGE

63
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,530
YOU'RE AT 49 TOMORROW EVENING.

64
00:01:48,531 --> 00:00:00,000
YOU ARE NOT AT 50.
