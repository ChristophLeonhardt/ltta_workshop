New York Times of the story out about the inner workings of the investigation the Donald Trump's campaign even before it became the Donald Trump administration and there's there's some interesting tidbits in there and then of course it made Donald Trump angrier that's nothing surprising but we'll get to his reaction at the end apparently the FBI program was called crossfire hurricane well that was preaching because a lot of crossfire and and a hurricane of criticism etc so well let's find out why were they investigating the Trump campaign in the first place well the first thing outward the Russians were meddling in the camp in in the election overall then they realized here let me go to the New York Times to quote this the FBI investigated for unidentified Trump campaign aides in those early months congressional investigators revealed in February the four men were Michael Flynn Paul Manafort Carter Paige and mr. Papadopoulos current and former officials said each was scrutinized because it was obvious or suspected Russian ties so FBI gets information that the Russians might be trying to interfere in all election then they find out four of the Trump and campaign officials have deep ties to the russians Manta Ford made a ton of money basically working for Russian oligarchs and and protecting their interest in Ukraine and he's now under massive investigation over that Michael Flynn might have been in what is technically called an agent of Russia and he wound up striking a deal with a special prosecutor so they were right they were right to investigate these guys and then that leads us to Carter page in Papadopoulos so they explained about page mr. page a foreign policy advisor was well-known to the FBI he had previously been recruited by Russian spies and was suspected of meeting one in Moscow during the campaign it would have been criminal negligence on the part of the FBI to not investigate that if any campaign Hillary Clinton's Gary Johnson's anyone's had people working inside of it that were Russians working with Russian spies and that went to Moscow in the middle of the campaign you have to investigate that of course of course you're the investigate bad so the Times explains relying on FBI information and mr. Steele's that's the famous steel dossier prosecutors obtained court approval to eavesdrop on mr. Page who is no longer with the Trump campaign so this is part of what the Trump team flips out about oh my god they were looking into our campaign well you've got a guy working with Russian spies in your campaign what do you want him to do so they they had enough evidence and they did this the right way the legal way to go and actually get court approval to eavesdrop on Carter page and at that point he wasn't even in the campaign anymore so now let's go to Papadopoulos lastly there was mr. Papadopoulos as The Times explains the young and inexperienced campaign aide whose wine fuelled conversation with the Australian ambassador set off to investigation before hack democratic emails appeared online he had seemed to know that Russia had political dirt on mrs. Clinton so Papadopoulos is in London he gets sauced starts talking to an Australian ambassador and starts telling them all the information that the Russians I have on Hillary Clinton the Ambassador is thinking huh this is it puts me in a really difficult situation I don't know what I'm supposed to do about this he goes to checks with US government they go talk to the FBI and then in a situation that is really rare that ambassador sits down with the FBI and gives them a formal interview and says you guys gotta watch out that this guy is talking about how the Russians have information and are working to interfere in your campaigns we fight and that was before it was revealed publicly that the Russians had in fact done that and they released the emails the Hillary Clinton emails the DNC emails etc so they knew ahead of time so if you're an investigator at the FBI and an allies ambassador comes and tells you hey look the Russians are gonna do this and then you see it happen again it would be gross negligence not to investigate that that's the whole point of that FBI is to investigate potential crimes etc just exactly along these lines more from The Times the FBI obtained phone records and other documents using National Security Letters a secret type of subpoena officials said and at least one government informant met several times with mr. Page and mr. Papadopoulos current and former officials said now this is again where the Trump guys go oh my god to head in a four-man infiltrate our campaign now you want to know why they did that because they didn't want to make it public before the election that they were investigating the Trump campaign potentially working with the Russians because that might have damaged Trump's campaign and they didn't know whether they actually had or not that's the whole point of an investigation so they didn't want to prejudge it so in order to be fair to Donald Trump they didn't want to go in and say okay campaign officials Papadopoulos Carter pastry used to work on the campaign you're gonna come in for questioning at the FBI that would have made it public then they would have had to talk about yes the Trump team is under investigation for possibly working with the Russians and that would have hurt Trump's chances tremendously in fact the FBI did him an enormous favor and and that favor actually is documented here in the New York Times story to and through sources at the FBI and wound up hurting Hillary Clinton a ton why because of the huge tight economy and how they treated two different campaigns Hillary Clinton was also being investigated by the FBI at the same time so now when Trump says oh this is like Watergate I can't believe they were investigating me but they were also investigating your opponent for a different reason so can the FBI never investigate anything that any politician ever does so but the difference was in Hillary's case two different times the FBI came out and said we're investigating her she was extremely careless as she did this that another thing and right before the election they came out we're opening their investigation right but meanwhile not a word about Trump when they also had an investigation about him as The Times explains agents feared being seen as withholding information or going too easy on Hillary Clinton now did they have that same figure about Donald Trump no they had the opposite fear and they worried that any overt actions against mr. Trump's campaign would only reinforces claims that the election was being rigged against them that is another case of Republican whining to the refs working brilliantly and by the way Mitch McConnell had that information congressional leaders the Obama administration had the information watch out the Russians might be interfering in your election and they might be working with the Trump team and Mitch McConnell said to Obama if you dare do that we'll say that you're meddling in the election and you're interfering in senator Obama's gugugu I would do it I would do it and they didn't make it public so they attacked Hillary Clinton publicly the FBI did but they did not tell you they were also investigating Donald Trump on what I would argue is a far more serious transgression so it is so ironic when Trump attacks them it's the exact opposite of what's true they went out of their way and and not necessary because they supported Trump and suddenly I officially found out through their text did not support Trump they also didn't support Hillary Clinton and they thought that the Justice Department should have gone harder after Hillary Clinton you know why because they're the FBI that's their job but even though they didn't support Trump they were like no no no no no some of them by the way others were Republicans who totally supported Trump but overall though the whole FBI was like no don't tell anybody publicly because then they'll yell at us Trump will yell at us and Republicans will yell at us Democrats yell at us who cares okay just run over Democrats so if there was any political bias at the FBI it was definitely against the Democrats in this particular election so now to be fair to Donald Trump New York Times explains a year and a half later no public evidence has surfaced connecting mr. Trump's advisors to the hacking or linking mr. Trump himself to the Russian government's disruptive efforts so and this is very important that's why this investigation has not concluded we don't know we don't know what's going to be at the end of it they explained look the Russians definitely hacked in according to our intelligence officials and and they got information then they released it and we know what that the Russians reached out to the Trump campaign and that they had a meeting Donald Trump jr. man afford and Kushner went to that meeting and and the meetings purpose was for them to get incriminating information about Hillary Clinton but at the meeting they did not get that information so at this point it's still unclear where the Trump administration actually received the information that the Russians had now it didn't really matter much because the Russians released them publicly anyway to me what I have said from day one and what is way more important is the potential money laundering involved with Donald Trump and his businesses well before the election and the Russians so frame for Donald Trump a little bit of help from the Russians during the campaign okay that's good and that's important and he publicly called for it just outrageous in the middle of the campaign he said ah I hope the rush is released more more information they might have stolen from his opponent yeah that's outrageous but it's help around the edges why Donald Trump might actually care about Russians is if he in fact did money launderer is a lot of publicly available evidence suggests well then he would want to make sure that there is no investigation that could lead down that path that's what he's actually worried about but is as far as the elections concern the investigation is not concluded and they do not yet know if the Trump team ever took information from the Russians and hence colluded with the Russians in that regard okay and finally to the Trump's tweet about this he says Wow word seems to be coming after the Obama FBI quote spied on the Trump campaign with an embedded informant Andrew McCarthy says there's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign if so this is bigger than Watergate but first of all I don't think you know what Watergate was in this case the FBI has evidence and we now find out overwhelming evidence which now the Senate Intelligence Committee led by Republicans confirms yes they meddled in the election yes they were against Hillary Clinton and yes the third point is they were in favor of Donald Trump what do you want that for me I too do not investigate that and they that informant was the whole point was to keep it quiet so it wouldn't hurt your campaign and yet Trump goes oh my god I can't believe this they're water getting me know if anything you're the one during Watergate you're the one that they're pretty that potentially did those crimes that they are legitimately investigating and of course though unfortunately these political attacks do work in the in the numbers that I'm obsessed with he got 61% of Republicans to believe that the FBI is completely lying and totally manufacturing evidence against them which is outrageous that's preposterous and yet with this propaganda saying it over and over again now Republicans think oh yeah yeah that's me I shouldn't have se8 Donald Trump even if he was you know they had evidence that he might have broken the law no no no I bet they made it up I bet they manufactured evidence that's crazy talk he's gotten the whole Republican Party if they didn't already lose their mind to lose it collectively two easy ways for the Young Turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on YouTube you're notified of our videos
