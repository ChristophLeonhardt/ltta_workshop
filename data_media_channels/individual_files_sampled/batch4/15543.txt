last week I reported on a University of Texas at Austin and Tifa group that hosts self-defense courses but it has also said bricks belong best thrown at pig heads well the commie craziness is even worse than I thought it turns out that this group has targeted students with mental illnesses for recruitment strap yourselves in because here we go the revolutionary student front is an antiva student group at ut-austin that doesn't seem to catch the irony in displaying liberating messages like it is right to rebel and all power to the people while wearing the garb of oppressors like terrorists and burglars but they're not just dunces playing dress-up you see the group admits to manipulating mentally handicapped individuals according to their 13,000 word manifesto found by watchdogs site far-left watch these antiva kids spit on what they call bourgeois mental health and instead ran a revolutionary mental health program for six months and 2017 to address the mental health needs of students in a way that would primarily serve to politicize and strengthen them to become more committed to revolution and more capable of carrying it out because why not cultural Marxists have already taken academia the media and Hollywood hostage it's only fair that they get to colonize our healthcare systems as well it's madness and just plain cruel they've likely targeted people who need proper health care but it all makes the perverted kind of sense if you understand leftism hammer and sickle sickos prey upon people with underdeveloped brains in our schools why should we be shocked when they also target Minds weakened by actual impediments the ut-austin antifa group says they read turn illness into a weapon a work about a German neo-marxist group which framed capitalist oppression as the cause of mental illness you'd have to have some kind of mental derangement to believe that right and the revolutionary student front admits as much when they say orienting recruitment toward those suffering from qualitatively more intense mental illness a population whose conditions in general service barriers to reaching the point of being continuous fighters we say in general because many of the best organism organisers in the revolutionary movement and our organization also suffer from these conditions does not accomplish the task of drawing from the most advanced sections of the people right but the mentally handicapped are more likely to swallow your propaganda uncritically we all know that when it comes to communism the end justifies the means and ante foe will try to achieve its by any means necessary which apparently extends to manipulating the mentally ill and remember this is a group interested in indoctrination with the goal of violence these ut-austin students openly admit they believe that the primary method of combating the symptoms of mental illness that we face under capitalism must be organizing those suffering to come into violent class conflict with a system that creates their illness what do these maniacs think that the capitalist dollar bill contains some wicked autism inducing black magic that they're tired Marxist mantra is something new and edgy and hasn't failed in epic proportions all around the world it's all fun and games when it happens in the horror flicks but we must not let the lunatics take over this asylum for campus unmasked I'm Robson shocked if you like this video and support our mission please make sure to comment and subscribe if something happens on your campus and you'd like us to investigate send us details using the forum on campus unmask calm you
