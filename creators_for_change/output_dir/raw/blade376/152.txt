00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
is this hair a result of stress or just

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,200

about to see before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually show it</font>

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,219
back in 2008<font color="#E5E5E5"> i launched a new channel</font>

6
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,440
called suck my mock it was a new online

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,480
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had in mind which was my</font>

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,140
satirical take with video blogging an

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,350
online community very cynical humor very

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,300
tongue-in-cheek but in a way that

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,060
celebrated what is great and what is not

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,849
so great about content on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

13
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:31,890
unfortunately every episode took me

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,110
about 24 hours to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i had to</font>

15
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,750
script it present it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to film it i</font>

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,030
had to edit it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had to research here</font>

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,829
yet permissions for the clips are used

18
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,600
and this was all very difficult because

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,120
i did it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a weekly basis and because i</font>

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,200
was doing the third year<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,180
university degree it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much</font>

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">however earlier this year when i was</font>

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">working for BBC comedy I made this brand</font>

24
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,140
new pilot for them but when I showed him

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,180
this in a meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was told it was</font>

26
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,699
great but unfortunately due to job cuts

27
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,270
I was no longer working for the BBC and

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,188
so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to post this online but I</font>

29
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,260
was told not to because I might still be

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,330
working with them on this but

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,650
unfortunately that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was never meant to be</font>

32
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,299
and I guess if I find the team of people

33
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,729
who want to work on this show with me in

34
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,460
