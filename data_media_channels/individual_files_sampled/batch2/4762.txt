back with some breaking news now from Axios Jonathan Swan is reporting throughout last year on four separate occasions the president pressured Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reclaim control of the Russia investigation The New York Times reported earlier this week on one of those conversations but sources tell Axios that it was more than that it actually happened three times in person and another time over the phone Jonathan Swan goes on to report flow to sources familiar with the conversations told me the president never to their knowledge ordered sessions to cancel his recusal from the Russia investigation instead he asked sessions whether he thought about unreasoning Trump told sessions he'd be a hero to conservatives if he did the right thing and took back control over the Russian investigation according to two sources with knowledge at their conversations last night the president once again attacked sessions on Twitter just before midnight here's what he tweeted quote the recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States quoting Joe digenova former US attorney Michael Steele give me a break what are they smoking down there this is getting into some of the best stuff you can get in town it's keeping them real high it's keeping them real high you know this is part of an ongoing strategy that this president has put in place and as has already been discussed it's very effective at I think we cannot lose sight as at how effective he is in laying down the kinds of tracks that he wants people to get on and follow him it's working for his base it clearly has worked for the Republican leadership that but does but it doesn't matter it does it doesn't matter out outside it because as you already said he already believes that he should have that power to do that right he should have that power they're afraid of his base they sit back and look across they're not destroying the Justice Department we'll worry about that later right now the only thing that matters is that the combination of the number of members who are retiring the combination of the poll numbers in their respective congressional districts where the president sitting at 70 and 80% they look at that and they're frozen in place this is no this stop being about leadership over a year ago this is about preservation I think they're worse than frozen there what's it in the destruction absolutely they are there's no doubt about that and these are the same numbnuts who after this is all over are gonna come on the back end and be all about law and order all about our Justice Department our FBI and how these good men and women who serve this country need to be protected when they've done everything in their power to undermine let me go hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
