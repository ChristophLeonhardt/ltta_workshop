PATRIOTS. Martha: EXACTLY. IS THAT A PROBLEM? I HAVE OTHER REASONS. GOD LOVE YOUR HONESTY. Martha: JOINING ME NOW IS A NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER FOR AXIOS. JONATHAN, GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. ONE ISSUE THAT THE JUDGE AND I DIDN'T GET TO IS THE ISSUE OF THE DICTATION BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE RESPONSE TO DONALD JUNIOR'S MEETING AT TRUMP TOWER. WHY IS IT PROBLEMATIC HE WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT? IT WAS PROBLEMATIC IN THE FIRST INSTANCE BECAUSE THE STATEMENT WAS MISLEADING. Martha: HOW WAS IT MISLEADING? THEY SAID IT WAS ABOUT RUSSIAN ADOPTION. THE MEETING THAT DON JUNIOR HAD WITH THE RUSSIANS. AND OBVIOUSLY, THAT WAS A PRETEXT. Martha: WASN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT THE RUSSIAN LAWYER AND THAT GROUP HAD BEEN LOBBYING FOR AND WORKING ON FOR A LONG TIME? NO QUESTION. BUT AS THE TRUMP TEAM WOULD NOW ACKNOWLEDGE THE MEETING ALSO INCLUDED SOME OTHER FAIRY RELEVANT THINGS INCLUDING THE E-MAILS TO SET IT UP WHICH DON JUNIOR AGREED WITH SAYING THEY I LOVE IT. COME ON IN. I LOVE IT. IS IT POSSIBLE I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THIS. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT IS WHAT THEY LURED HIM WITH AND THEY WANTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT THE OTHER THING AND DIDN'T HAVE THE DIRT. THEY WANTED HIM IN THE ROOM AND FIGURED THAT WOULD WORK. AND THE PRESIDENT SAID WHO WOULDN'T TAKE THE MEETING IN TODAY'S POLITICS? BUT THE TO YOUR QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THAT IT IS LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC. IT'S NOT ILLEGAL TO LIE TO THE NEWS MEDIA OR THE "NEW YORK TIMES." THE PRESENT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ROBERT MUELLER AND RUDY GIULIANI CONTINUALLY REMINDS US ONE REASON HE HASN'T SPOKEN TO MUELLER AND THEY'VE BEEN RESTRAINING THAT, THEY DON'T WANT HIM TO PURGER HIMSELF. SO THIS IS RUDY GIULIANI, LITERALLY SAID THAT. HE SAID WE ARE SHIFTING EXPLANATIONS AND THE MISLEADING STATEMENTS, THIS IS WHY WE DON'T WANT THE PRESIDENT INTERVIEWED BY BOB MUELLER. Martha: WHAT IS YOUR SENSE AT THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT ALL OF THIS? BECAUSE TODAY, YOU KNOW, ALL THE CONVERSATIONS I JUST SAID, THE 500th DAY IN OFFICE. BUT ALL THE CONVERSATION IS ABOUT THE COMMENTS OVER THE WEEKEND. THE PRESIDENT SAYING THAT HE COULD PARDON HIMSELF IF HE WANTED TO, AND THAT THE INVESTIGATION IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. AS FAR AS THE MESSAGE STRUCTURING GOES, THIS IS A FAILURE. SO, THERE IS TWO PARTS TO THIS THING. IF I READ ABOUT THE MOOD OF THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE RUSSIAN INVESTIGATION. IT'S NONSENSE. THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. RUSSIA THE ONE WORD NOBODY IN THE WEST WING TALKS ABOUT. THEY DON'T HAVE MEETINGS ABOUT IT. IF THERE IS ANY MENTION OF IT PEOPLE TRY TO LEAVE THE ROOM. LIKE A WORD NO ONE WANTS ANYTHING TO DO WITH. THAT BEING SAID, THERE IS THIS DYNAMIC PARTICULARLY IN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SHOP WHERE THEY ARE WATCHING THE SHOW LIKE THE REST OF US. THEY HAVE NO EARTHLY IDEA WHAT RUDY GIULIANI IS GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, TO WHOEVER IN THE NEXT MINUTE OR ON TV TONIGHT. IT'S THIS COMPLETELY SEPARATION OPERATION. HONESTLY, THEY VIEW IT AS A CIRCUS A LOT OF THEM. THEY SEE THIS, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON, THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT HE IS GOING TO SAY. THEY ASSUME THERE IS COORDINATION BETWEEN RUDY GIULIANI AND THE PRESIDENT. BUT I THINK THEY ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE OUT OF IT AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT AND LEAVE IT TO THOSE GUYS AND THE MORE WE CAN JUST SAY AS SPOKES PEOPLE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU KNOW, I DEFER TO THE PRESIDENT'S OUTSIDE COUNSEL. THAT IS THE MAGIC SENTENCE FOR ALL OF THEM. Martha: YOU CAN SENSE THE FRUSTRATION IN THE BRIEFING ROOM TODAY. SURE! Martha: SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SAID LOOK, THERE IS A CHINESE WALL. WE ARE NOT THE LEGAL TEAM. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THEM, YOU HAVE TO ASK THEM. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE LEGAL TEAM DOES LEAK FROM TIME TO TIME AND YOU CAN GET ANSWERS FROM THE LEGAL TEAM IF YOU PUSH HARD ENOUGH BUT THAT IS A FRUSTRATION FOR THE PRESS CORPS. IT'S A FRUSTRATION FOR THE PRESS TEAM AND I REMEMBER WHEN JOHN DOWD WHO WROTE THAT MEMO YOU TALKED ABOUT, ONE OF THE AUTHORS OF IT, THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER LAWYER. I REMEMBER HE WAS GIVING INTERVIEWS AND I TALKED TO THE SENIOR PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SHOP AND THEY WERE TEARING THEIR HAIR OUT. THEY HAD NO IDEA SOME OF THIS STUFF WAS COMING. THEY HAD TO RESPOND TO IT. SO IT'S NEVER BEEN COORDINATED IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM.
