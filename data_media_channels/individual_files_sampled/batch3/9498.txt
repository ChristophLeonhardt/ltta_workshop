Martha: AS YOU ALL KNOW, THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC HAS HIT THE COUNTRY HARD. WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT IN GREAT DETAIL, BUT LET'S GET STARTED AT THE TOP OF OUR QUESTIONS. Bret: GROSSMAN JENKINS, YOU ARE AT THE CENTER OF THE STAGE BECAUSE YOU ARE LEADING IN THE FOX NEWS POLL IN THIS RACE, YOUR OPPONENTS ON THE STAGE HOWEVER CALL YOU A CARD CARRYING MEMBER OF THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT. YOU VOTED FOR THE 1.3 TRILLION DOLLY OCEAN SPENDING BILL THAT CONSERVATIVES CALLED UPLOADED MATERIAL AND REPUBLICANS ALIGN WITH MITCH McCONNELL ARE SPENDING MONEY TO HELP YOUR CAMPAIGN. SO HERE'S THE QUESTION, HOW DO YOU CONVINCE WEST VIRGINIA VOTERS THAT YOU CAN DRAIN THE SWAMP IF THEY THINK THAT YOU ARE A PART OF IT? THANK YOU, BRET AND MARTHA AND TO EVERY ONE OF YOU THAT ARE HERE THIS EVENING. FROM A PROUD WEST VIRGINIA, I HAVE NOT BEEN UP IN THE SWAMP A VERY LONG. I TOOK OUT A 38 YEAR INCUMBENT JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. I AM UP IN WASHINGTON ACTUALLY WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THIS ESTABLISHMENT. I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE SWAMP. AND WHAT A DIFFERENCE AN ELECTION MAKES. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE WEST VIRGINIA TURNING AROUND. WORKING WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP, STANDING UP WITH HIM. I PROUDLY ENDORSED PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THE MAY PRIMARY 2016. THE ONLY ONE UP HERE ON THE STAGE WHO DID THAT AND HAVE BEEN STANDING WITH HIM EACH AND EVERY DAY.
