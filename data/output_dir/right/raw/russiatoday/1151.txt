in this situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what happens in</font>

158
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't it say a lot that he was that</font>

159
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,680
deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to defend for his team in in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to be everyone he'll play they</font>

162
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,990
had a corner so yeah he's probably but

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,639
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you would hate he would be a</font>

168
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,210
don't understand why they didn't push

169
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">why did he make so many changes I got</font>

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,900
really I've really got so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

171
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,389
what was your<font color="#CCCCCC"> King love thinking about</font>

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">success he's had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a horrific</font>

174
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,389
result ultimate the group<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font>

175
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,740
is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

176
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">make everybody's mind up about making a</font>

177
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,270
change in Germany<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said before the</font>

228
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninety two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes you figured there's</font>

229

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,750
went again to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> koreans noia way up</font>

233
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,700
the pitch lost the ball and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen you know one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things I</font>

235
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,049
really like about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Noah you know he will</font>

236
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,750
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything it takes to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get back in</font>

237
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">again so he will you will sacrifice and</font>

238
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,300
Gamble and

239
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,370
being that extra man up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the penalty</font>

240
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">box unfortunately he didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get all the</font>

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">way up there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clip the ball ended with him</font>

243
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,380
and he didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it was taken off in</font>

244
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,209
one long pass that would have been I

245
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean that ball could easily have gone in</font>

246
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:02,290
had it been one more meter to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

247
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could have been sunk or maybe the</font>

248
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,450
the the longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal in in history and</font>

249
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,430
woke up I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know that's for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

250
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,019
to find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously it went</font>

251
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">too far again not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but that's enough</font>

252
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">sidebar and and he was clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in inside</font>

253
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,800
his own half<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was outside and then</font>

254
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,930
it was too near<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I can tell you at</font>

255
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,480
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment you should have seen the</font>

Mexican supporters<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean from looking</font>

257
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,620

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,230
their own game singing dancing and we

260
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,720
could hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so a really</font>
