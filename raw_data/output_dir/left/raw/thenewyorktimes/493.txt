3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:09,170
Now that's a jump.

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,160
It would even make Michael Jordan proud.

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:17,028
Look at it again, see how the abdomen curls
up as the mantis leaps?

6
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:21,990
That curl is a crucial move for a juvenile
mantis which

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,120
doesn't have any wings yet, when it launches
itself toward a target.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,740
That's what Cambridge University researchers
found when they

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,240
analyzed the leap using high speed video.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,330
The curled abdomen changes the center of the
jumper's mass and

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,140
it also generates just a little bit of spin.

12
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,740
It turns out that the mantis needs to
generate some spin first and

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,740
then correct it on the fly in order to make
an accurate jump.

14
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,690
That finding could be very useful for
engineers

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,460
who are now trying to figure out how to make
jumping robots not spin out of control.

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,300
Look what happens to the mantis when

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,070
glue is used to make the abdomen too stiff to
curl properly.

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,650
The mantises couldn't do it.

19
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,340
Sometimes they even crashed head on.

20
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,277
Of course, even without the glue, the
mantises weren't perfect, but then,

21
00:01:12,277 --> 00:01:14,127
neither was Michael Jordan.
