GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO A VERY SPECIAL EDITION OF TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT, INSIDE THE ISSUES. POLITICS IS SO DOMINANT SUDDENLY RIPPING THIS COUNTRY APART WHEN STUDENTS ATTACK FREE SPEECH IN THE NAME OF TOLERANCE. THEY HAVE ABANDONED THEIR THE OLD CAUSES TO ATTACK ISSUES LIKE GLOBAL WARMING. LEADERS ARE NOW DEMANDING WE BOMB AL-ASSAD AND WE WILL HIT ALL OF THOSE STORIES TONIGHT. PLUS THEY ARE EATING HORSEMEAT IN THIS COUNTRY AMAZINGLY. WE'LL START WITH THE EFFORTS TO SPY ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, AND THERE IS MORE EVIDENCE THEN THE COLLISION WITH RUSSIA BUT NOT SURPRISING, THE MEDIA RESPONSE HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY DISHONEST. TRUMP DOUBLES DOWN ON HIS BASELESS CLAIMS OF SPIES. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THERE WAS A SPY, SO IT'S REALLY A FAKE ISSUE. IT'S THIS PHONY BALONEY STORY ABOUT A SPY IN THE CAMPAIGN. TO CALL THEM CONSPIRACY THEORIES IS TOO MUCH CREDIT, JUST FAKE FACTS. Tucker: THEY ARE LIARS. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA, AS RELIABLE BAROMETER OF MY LIST CONVENTIONAL WISDOM AS EXISTS ON PLANET EARTH EXPLAINED IT THIS WAY IN A RECENT INTERVIEW. QUOTE A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT IS NOT A SPY. WELL SENATOR GRAHAM DID NOT EXPLAIN WHAT EXACTLY A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT IS, OF COURSE, IF NOT A SPY BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE AND THE SAME. ANY SENATOR WHO PRETENDS OTHERWISE IS PREVARICATING, OR IN OTHER WORDS, LYING. WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS STORY SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING. DAN, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND LAW ENFORCEMENT YOUR WHOLE LIFE. IF I AM CONFIDENTIALLY INFORMING ON YOU, WHAT AM I DOING EXACTLY? TUCKER, THIS IS THE MOST OF A SERIES OF SICKENING, DISGUSTING AND DISTURBING EPISODES BY PRAVDA. NOT EVEN, THEY ACTUALLY PRETENDED TO BE JOURNALISTS DISTRIBUTING FACTS. KEEP IN MIND THAT THEY WANT TO DO COUNTERINTELLIGENCE, THEY CAN'T EVEN DO JOURNALISM. NOW THEY ARE PRETENDING TO BE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS COVER-UP BY THE MEDIA THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. EVERY SERIOUS PERSON AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND I SAID SERIOUS, NOT THE HACKS TRYING TO COVER FOR THIS, KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED HERE WAS A SPYING OPERATION. SPY, SPY Y IF YOU ARE JOE BIDEN. IF ANYONE TELLS YOU OTHERWISE, THEY ARE JOKING AROUND. Tucker: THEY ARE ALL TELLING US OTHERWISE WHICH IS WHY I'M BEGINNING TO DOUBT MYSELF. I'M OPEN-MINDED. TELL ME SERIOUSLY IF I'M MISSING SOMETHING. THEY SAID IT WASN'T A SPY, IT WAS A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT. IS THERE SOMETHING I'M MISSING? YES THERE IS. BUT THE DIFFERENCE WORKS AGAINST THEM MEDIA AND NOT FOR THOSE JOKERS. HERE IS HOW WE WOULD COMMONLY IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT INTELLIGENCE ARENA, WHERE I HAD INTERSECTED AND WORKED FOR MOST OF MY ADULT LIFE. AN INFORMATIVE SOMEONE ALREADY EXISTING INSIDE OF AN OPERATION WHO WOULD INFORM ON THE OPERATIONS OF SET OPERATION. THE MOB, WHATEVER IT MAY BE. A SPY WOULD LIKELY BE SOMEONE YOU BRING IN IS NOT A PRE-EXISTING MEMBER OF THE OPERATION. YOU TRY TO INSERT AND INTERSECT WITH THAT ORGANIZATION TO GET INFORMATION TO EITHER PROSECUTE THEM OR INVESTIGATE THEM ON A CI CASE. WHICH MEANS, THE GUY IN THIS CASE WAS A SPY. THESE KNUCKLEHEADS ARE TUCKER, YOU UNDERSTAND THIS IS FULL-BLOWN PROPAGANDA? Tucker: I DO. EITHER WAY, THE PERSON'S FUNCTION IS THE SAME. HE IS SPYING, GATHERING INFORMATION AND NOT TELLING YOU HE'S DOING IT, AND SENDING IT TO A THIRD PARTY. AND I'M ASKING DUMB RHETORICAL QUESTIONS, JUST BECAUSE THEY KEEP THROWING THIS OUT YOU LIKE, BLACK IS WHITE, TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS EIGHT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE THIS RIGHT. IF THEY WERE DOING THIS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TRIM CAMPAIGN AS CLAPPER IS NOW CLAIMING, WOULDN'T THEY HAVE TOLD THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WE ARE WORRIED THE RUSSIANS ARE TRYING TO PENETRATE YOU. BUT THEY DIDN'T. TUCKER, IF THIS WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, WHY NOT EQUAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR THE HILLARY CAMPAIGN? HER HUSBAND TOOK A SPEAKING FEE, WHY NOT HELP THEM TO AND PUT AN FBI CONFIDENTIAL IT IS A SCAM FBI CONFIDENTIAL IT IS A SCA SCAM. TUCKER, THE EUPHEMISM GAME. WHAT IS IT NEXT, AN UNDOCUMENTED FBI EMPLOYEE? THIS IS SO DESTRUCTIVE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, LIBERAL OR DEMOCRAT, WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. A GROSS AT THE SERVICE WAS DONE HERE. THERE WERE POTENTIAL ALI ILLICIT SPY OPERATIONS FOR A POLITICAL REASON. VOTE FOR WHOEVER YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR, I DON'T CARE. I'M JUST TELLING YOU THAT HAVE BEEN HERE WAS AN ABOMINATION TO THE REPUBLIC AND THE MEDIA IS COVERING IT UP. Tucker: IT'S ONE THING TO SEE NANCY PELOSI TWO DEFENDANT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.
