KIDNEYS.
SIMILAR TECHNIQUE, NEIL.
>> Neil: THANKS, JOHN ROBERTS.
AS HE POINTED OUT, THE PRESIDENT
IS THERE NOW AT WALTER REED WITH
HIS WIFE.
ON THE PHONE WITH U.S. HAVE
DAVID FROM NEW YORK.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Neil: THIS LOOKS LIKE A
PREPLANNED EVENT TO HAVE THIS
TAKEN CARE OF.
IS THIS YOUR FIRST READ OF IT?
>> NEIL, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY
NEED TO BE PREPLANNED FINDING.
A LOT OF TIMES WHAT WE'RE
FINDING IS INCIDENTAL FINDINGS
WHERE SOMEONE MAY HAVE VAGUE
SYMPTOMS, NAUSEA, VOMITING, BACK
PAIN, SOMETIMES A FAINT FEELING.
WE FIND THEM ON MRI AND CAT SCAN
TO HAVE A LESION IN THE KIDNEY.
JOHN WAS CORRECTED AND MY
DIAGNOSIS WOULD BE THE
ANGIOMYELYPOMA.
THIS IS A KIND OF BENIGN TUMOR
THAT WE USUALLY SEE IN THE
FOURTH TO SIXTH DECADES, USUALLY
AMONG WOMEN.
SHE'S A PERFECT MATCH FOR THIS
BENIGN TUMOR EVEN THOUGH WE'RE
SPECULATING.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
A LOT OF TIMES, IF IT'S OVER 4
CENTIMETER, WE WOULD BE WORRIED
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF GROWTH
IN THE FUTURE OR POSSIBLE
BLEEDING, WHICH IS WHAT SORT OF
THESE TUMORS CAN DO.
THEY CAN BURST AND CAUSE
BLEEDING IN THE BACK.
SO SURGICALLY, YOU KNOW, WE USED
TO DO -- REMOVE PART OF THE
KIDNEY YEARS AGO.
ONCE EMBOLIZATION CAME IN THE
PICTURE, MADE IT MUCH EASIER BY
PUSHING SOME OF THESE COILS OR
POLY VINYLS THAT WE CAN PUT IN
THESE TINY VESSELS THAT GO TO
THAT MASS.
OBVIOUSLY NOT THE REST OF THE
KIDNEY.
WE CAN SHRINK THOSE BENIGN
MASSES, THE TUMORS, AND SHRINK
THEM AND AVOID ANY KIND OF
SURGICAL TREATMENT.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE.
THE REASON WHY THEY'RE WATCHING
OVER THEM TO MAKE SURE THIS IS
NOT AFFECTING HER KIDNEY
FUNCTION.
THE RID OF THE KIDNEY IS VIABLE.
THERE'S NO COMPLICATED AS FAR AS
BLEEDING, INFECTION AND THOSE
ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT THEY
HAVE TO LOOK FOR.
>> SO THE FACT THAT SHE'S IN THE
HOSPITAL A FEW DAYS AND WILL BE
THERE THROUGH THE BULK OF THE
WEEK, DOCTOR, SHOULD WE READ
INTO THAT?
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE E-MAILED AND
WORRIED WHAT ARE YOU TELLING
THEM?
>> NOT AT ALL.
SHE WILL GET BORED.
A LOT OF THESE ARE FAIRLY
ROUTINE.
WE HAVE BEEN DOING EMBOLIZATION
FOR THE LAST ALMOST 30, 40
YEARS.
AND I THINK IT'S BEEN USED FOR
LIVER NOW, PROSTATE INSTEAD OF
JUST SHAVING THE PROSTATE AND
EVEN AS JUST MENTIONED FOR MYOMA
IN WOMAN FOR HAVING THIS BIG
MASS ON THEIR UTERUS.
IF IT'S A ROUTINE PROCEDURE IN
MEDICINE, THIS IS A FAIRLY
ROUTINE PROCEDURE IN THE HANDS
OF AN INTERVENTION RADIOLOGIST
AND WE'RE GOING TO WATCH HER TO
MAKE SURE SHE'S FINE.
MY SPECULATION IS THAT OVER THE
NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS, SHE
SHOULD GO HOME WITHOUT ANY
