hello I'm handsome seeker this is counting the cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week Venezuela in crisis we'll look at how the oil industry the country's only source of income is in meltdown also this week the internet is about to change we'll be taking a closer look at new rules giving consumers the right to be forgotten online plus France's total warns it will pull out of a major gas project in Iran as US sanctions lube our cereal maker Kellogg's became the latest multinational to pull out of Venezuela this week management blamed the economic crisis unfolding that hyperinflation along with a seventy billion dollar bond default means basic food and medicine can't be imported the military has been put in charge of food distribution and the government is running out of cash but despite the near economic collapse president Nicolas Maduro is standing for re-election the US the EU and fifteen of Latin America's biggest countries have already said they will not recognize the result the country's sole source of income is oil but even here the industry is in meltdown Venezuela cannot feed its people yet in the east of the country the Orinoco belt holds one of the world's largest reserves of heavy crude oil the oil price recovery has done little to help Venezuela OPEC says oil production is down to a 30-year low of around 1.4 million barrels a day and troubles are mounting for the state-run oil company pdvsa as lawsuits over unpaid bonds of building this week the Caribbean island of curacao ruled that US oil major ConocoPhillips could seize assets owned by pdvsa direct sanctions on the oil sector are also a possibility if Maduro wins a second term we're joining us now to talk more about this from London is Diego Moya or Campos a senior analyst for the Americas with IHS market good to speak with you again so it does really seem as if the the creditors are circling now with Venezuela is this going to make things even tougher for them now certainly has him a real pleasure absolutely things are deteriorating very very fast and no one wants to be the last in line until now amid the perception within markets and investor have been that Venezuela pays late but pays and few craters have dare to initiate or file legal actions against Venezuela to try to seize assets instead they have preferred to look behind the scenes from some sort of payment agreement after Conoco and the recent actions of the of these days will seem a more aggressive stance and less patients from cradles trying to seize Venezuelan assets and certainly no one wants to be the last in line what about the potential impact as well of expected US sanctions on Venezuela yes the combination of potential US sanctions on Venezuela on the old sector which is Venezuela's main source of revenue representing 25 percent of GDP 50 percent of fiscal revenues and 97 percent of revenue for foreign exchange is crucial if you add that to the operational disruption which is affecting egg exports resulting four from increase attempts to seize all cargos Venezuelan oil exports certainly that's a big deal and also the fact that Venezuela's all production because of mismanagement is falling dramatically it stands at one point for millions one point four million barrels per day according to a peg and we have to remember that one year and a half ago it was 2.4 million barrels a day and when you combine that with expected sanctions on Iran later this year as a result of the u.s. pulling out of the the Iran nuclear deal what's all that gonna mean for the oil markets well certainly that will have an impact I think in the Pacific a so Venezuela I think the market has already absorbed this idea that Venezuela increasingly no longer be a key player within OPEC and that all production will systematically continue declining and it seems to have gone to a point where it's costing Venezuela more to to get oil out of the ground and and get it to market than it is to sell it even though oil prices are started going up now but that doesn't seem to have made a difference for Venezuela why is that I mean the key thing for for the Venezuelan government in itself is that the issue of the economy doesn't seem to be a priority for President Maduro he's just focused on trying to retain power trying to be reelected but as we speak the economy is likely to contract at least 15% this year inflation already the highest in the world is likely to continue escalating shortages of food and basic goods including mason's are likely to continue intensifying and without production continuous declining at the government increasingly has less and less a room of maneuver but we are not seeing any signs of Maduro administration sending any any sign that they're going to radically change the direction of the economy rather what we've seen is more government intervention more regulatory burden and certainly just again continue in priority to politics rather dealing with the economy which is the main concern of Venezuelans struggling to survive on a day-to-day in these humanitarian crisis that the country is going through yeah and you seem to be suggesting there that a lot of Venezuela's economic problems are self-inflicted and that seems to be the consensus of a lot of economists just to explain that to us I mean because it does seem when you look at Venezuela's economy it's it's like a study in how not how not to fix your economy indeed absolutely it has been the direct result of economic mismanagement during the whole area of chavismo first under Chou is now under Maduro and widespread corruption corruption has been one of the key issues which has undermined the potential of Venezuela's whole sector on which he I think one of the key protagonists of these Venezuelan and drama and it's an irony because Chavez came to power in 1999 with the pledge to tackle corruption and tackle income inequality now twenty years down the line we have a country which is much less corrupt than he was before Chavez and indeed corruption has played a key role in this economic disaster de Venezuela is good to speak with you Diego Moya or campus I think you have him always a pleasure now French president Emmanuel macron says European companies should be able to choose freely whether to trade with Iran regardless of the reintroduction of US sanctions but some French companies are under pressure to shut down their operations in the Islamic Republic fearing consequences for their US ventures if they defy the sanctions they were Chater reports from Paris total signed a multi-billion dollar deal with Tehran only ten months ago to help develop the Iranian sector of the giant south pars gas field it was the largest foreign investment in the Islamic Republic that followed the signing of the nuclear deal unless Washington grants him a special exemption the company cannot risk being exposed to the huge financial penalties that will come if they continue to work when the sanctions come back into force in November if only Russia and China can make business Iran I'm not sure it's very good for what we represent in the world Europe and in the u.s. this reality it's a huge blow to European hopes of keeping the nuclear deal going without the United States the Iranian Foreign Minister told his counterparts in Brussels early this week Tehran needs guarantees foreign investment will continue if the nuclear deal is to survive your honor on the key is to assure the enterprises that will be affected by the measures are protected and to make sure that there are mechanisms for compensation and protection total made tower over the commercial landscape in Paris but the truth is they do 90 percent of their transactions American banks when Washington dictates they have to listen there's no such thing as economic sovereignty in a world where the dollar is king the head of a think tank on Iranian business sinks though it's time for Europe to put up its defenses it is a very complicated world in which the the US Treasury is being used as a hammer in the commercial interests of of the US and I think the the Europeans need to wake up to this and to put into place the legislation to regain their own sovereignty another blow to the nuclear deal has just been delivered by the world's largest all shipping container firm the Danish company mask has announced it will end all commercial activity in Iran the exodus is growing as Washington lights a bonfire under Europe's commercial vanities while still to come on counting the cost could independent filmmakers be self-censoring in an effort to secure funding we'll go behind the scenes at the Cannes Film Festival but first the remaining families in a long-running land dispute in Cambodia are vowing to fight to the end land grabbing by the government and private companies is a big issue there in one case they've been trying to remove people from an area in the capital to make way for new buildings whenhe reports from plum pen surrounded by piles of toxic burning rubbish 23 families call one dilapidated building home that tired of the conditions they live in but they refuse to leave until they get a better deal from the landowner that destroyed other homes here to make space available for development the residents of pnom Pennsbury Cola see it as a battle for their rights and a battle between rich and poor we're just villages and we're fed up of being left behind if we can't live like the rich we just want to live here peacefully that's enough for us the dispute started more than 10 years ago when the government gave the land to a property developer with close connections to the prime minister behind this huge gate is the headquarters of Panamax the company at the center of this dispute it's also the home of the company's owner so it's a pan we requested an interview with her but didn't get a response the government also didn't respond to a request for an interview a deal was reached with some residents to move into new buildings on the same site but after promising to construct 10 only 8 were built not enough for everyone land disputes are common in Cambodia and many of the problems stem from the late 1970s when the Khmer Rouge ran the country during its violent rule it destroyed records and today the public has little or no access to official property information meaning the state or big business can take land almost at will people had the right to protest but that's often met with violent crackdowns rights worker armed samarth was attacked by government security guards during a March a year and a half ago and he is still being investigated for inciting the violence when people use their rights to protest companies always use lawyers and the courts to put pressure on them sue in the wrestler map some families from break a law were forced to relocate to a barren piece of land 50 kilometres outside the capital with no easy access to work or education among them was Kim Saran who when she saw how small her new plot was decided she couldn't set up home here what I say is a poor Saturday we didn't volunteer to move here my land is just three by 12 metres so I can't even build a house on it when we filed a complaint to the authorities they ignored us adding to the insecurity for those who moved no land titles have been given to them so the company can simply move them on again for those who chose to stay at borough a collab that's a possibility they've been living with for years on May 25th the internet will change from that date if your personal data is being used by any company in the European Union then you have rights that didn't exist before this is a global change because so many internet companies have employees or users somewhere in Europe our data is used to try to sell us stuff in the shape of personalized advertising it's how Internet companies make money and why so much of the Internet is free to users we're the product not the customer and data is a billion-dollar industry but now those companies will have responsibilities and if they fail to live up to them then they will be fined by the European Union the e used new set of rules are known as gdpr and it's a major change for how our online world works GD P R stands for general data protection regulation the new law applies to all global Internet companies processing user data in the EU they include everything from your credit card details to your photos and even biometric data companies must clearly ask for consumers consent to harvest data so people will have to actively opt in consumers also now have the right to know if their data is being used and for what purpose a company's in breach of GDP can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover and users who no longer want their personal data processed have the right to be forgotten and have their data deleted companies will now also have to tell you if your personal data has been hacked as soon as possible well joining us now via Skype from New York is Jason bier chief privacy officer at the engine group a global data-driven marketing company thanks for being with us now I know you're not a fan of gdpr and your view is that the consumer is the clear loser in all of this but the whole law is designed to give them rights that they didn't have before and surely legal rights over your own data is a good thing isn't it well it certainly is I mean we we advocate and have for a very long time that consumers should be able to you know have control over their data and you know for the most part definitely that's the case it gdpr has good intentions however some of the some of the law itself really it breaks the internet I mean there's a lot of confusion and how the interpretation of personal personal data will be interpreted really by the data protection authorities in each member state there has been you know the addition of an IP address which is considered personal data that if it's process before consent is given by the user that would be a violation of the gdpr and as we all know the IP address is an essential building block of the Internet every communication that says between a device and a web page it exchanges that simple data so it's really a question of what is consumer data what is personal data and that definition has been broadened dramatically and and so what we're going to see really is potentially more data being shared with consumers because or with businesses with by consumers that causes really an increase in the amount of data that's that's given to companies rather than curtailing data sharing you've said as well we kind of sleepwalking into this data protection brexit as it were I'm wondering if you could explain that and if you could tell us as well because the idea is that you know these tech companies have have made a lot of money out of out of using our data and something needs to be done to hold them accountable what do you say to that well look we don't need to break the internet to do that you know I know Google and Facebook are really gonna be empowered by gdpr they're very familiar to people they the services are widely used they're gonna get up in consent that's really the issue here small businesses can't get off in consent they they have a hard time because they don't collect personal data they don't collect you know personally identify identifiable information that Google on Facebook do you know breaking the internet to get back as big these big companies is is really it's not going to work it's going to further empower them they're gonna collect more not less data on individuals and they're going to associate that to personally identifiable information versus companies like engine that have pseudonymous data and help small publishers earn money and in order to pay their you know for their content creation and I think you're really that's the disturbing issue here is that we're seeing large-scale confusion on how gdpr is to be interpreted there hasn't been any economic studies on the impact of this regulation but in the way in the wake of the the Cambridge analytic a scandal surely some kind of regulation is needed isn't it particularly with with companies like Facebook and Google that's a good question I think that the the issue really is here how how does an individual company handle privacy and I think and I know that you know Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook's have a huge issue with how they manage privacy I don't think that should be you know necessarily imputed on other businesses that have good privacy practice but have data minimization practices that don't do that there's a lot of small businesses out there that have a very small amount of data and are able to leverage that and create content and keep internet free and and encourage diversity of content out around the world good to speak with you Jason beard joining us there thanks very much for being with us well joining us now from Brussels is Diego Naranjo a senior policy adviser at European digital rights thanks very much for being with us so the new law this new law comes into effect next week then has enough been really done to educate people about this and that's a good question we're not sure we have been telling the European Commission that a such a change in its a proper campaign to advise it to tell people how their rights are going to be reinforced we have seen a lot of misinformation by private companies who see their business model affected or potentially affected by this regulation and we haven't seen yet such a big campaign from from public authorities from European Union we are launching a campaign ourselves an attorney from a well we are trying to inform users of the new rights and some people say that gdpr is it benefits big technology companies rather than holding companies like facebook to account what do you say to that criticism well if that was true I guess we would have seen less heavy lobbying companies less loving from from them in the last four and a half years that lasted their negotiations so I don't think that that's the case the new regulation brings a lot of strength and mechanisms it brings potential big sanctions so I don't think they will be able to benefit directly from it I think if they follow the rules that we'll be able to do their business at as anybody else and they of course they're big so they will be able to adapt quickly but I'm not sure this going to reinforce these two big companies rather the opposite will it not be harder for smaller internet businesses to operate given these new new rules new restrictions rather around IP addresses I don't think so whether we have to take two akanda this is only the the app of their current directive so there's not much new in a way in this regulation so those companies that were respecting the the current directive which is in place is 1995 don't have anything to do a bit probably a bit of an update but not much and those who have something to be afraid to who could suffer some eye problems are those who are already not respecting and data protection regulations here in the u another criticism of these new rules is this is actually going to restrict competition and content and in a number of ways what will still Pete what people still be able to use the Internet as freely as they have in the past of course yes and what these rules allow is for the movement of personal data and then the legal use of this personal data but also requires the consent of users for such use so people are able to do whatever they want on the internet they're free to share their pictures their personal data as they wish as long as they are really informed of what's going to be done with their personal data and so I don't think this country will restrict anything but rather enhance and data protection friendly businesses to do the what they are already doing and users to be more in charge of their personal data good to speak with you Diego not uncle thank you and finally the seventy-first can film festival wraps up this week this glamorous event is not just about showing films though it's a huge movie market and behind the scenes it's all about securing funding to get films made Charlie Angelo reports it's what every Directorate can hopes for a packed audience but Mohammed been a TA also hopes his story of a boy abandoning his family to join ISIL will be seen far beyond the festival weight more I hope it will touch the Chinese in audience first and then a wider audience this is a universal theme everybody in the world should see can champions art house cinema films made outside of the studio system but independent cinema this side of the Atlantic relies heavily on European state funds of the 21 films here competing for the Palme d'Or prize 15 receives some European money it's a lifeline for filmmakers but how does it influence storytelling producer Mei O'Day is here hunting for funds for her next project you need to let them like the story so they can attach it to their audience because at the end of the day it's a state fund and in case in in France and Germany and also the film will be shown in the their TV also and in there cinema the Lebanese film cafe amman moroccan film Sofia were co-funded by France and of Doha Film Institute an organization trying to address the balance by bringing Arab storytelling to the forefront a way for us to survive now it's to tell our stories in the way that we want to tell our stories from our perspective and not let anyone else anymore tell our story for us and put us at least different stereotypes stereotypes aren't what Francis CNC fund is looking for but they admit some writers do self-censor in an attempt to win grants sometimes they come with an idea of what global cinema is I spot these scripts immediately they try to cover all subjects and women's issues to homosexuality and cram them into one story like a tour operator of all society's problems to those we say no can choose its films for their wide appeal but it's often an independent spirit that wins the prize a spirit that each country needs to celebrate and support and that is
