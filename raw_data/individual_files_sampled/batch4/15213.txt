you know if an organization ever wanted to launch a public awareness campaign in an effort to stamp out disillusionment I think we now have the perfect poster boy for such a mandate ex PC leader Patrick Brown so first patch of brown was vying to be premier then he was out and then he jumped back into the race to become PC leader again and then he was out look maybe you think Patrick Brown received a raw deal from the steadily unraveling report CTV aired regarding woman who claimed Brown acted in a sexually inappropriate manner toward them nothing has been proven in a court of law and it should be noted that Brown is proceeding with a libel suit against CTV and maybe extra curricular extra naina Ginza side you are or were a loyal patch of brown supporter and thought that the people's guarantee platform was the most important political document pendant since the Magna Carta but after the last month of Patrick Brown shenanigans I have to ask is this man delusional it's baffling how could Patrick not know that tossing his hat in the ring to be party leader again would only infuriate so many people in the PC party who claimed his very presence would be nothing more than a giant distraction how could he not realize that clinging to a promise to implement a carbon tax who was a no-hoper how could he not understand that the four other members vying for party leadership considered him to be downright toxic to the PC brand how could he not realize that thanks to his words and actions and his alleged interference that he alienated an untold number of social fiscal and even democratic conservatives even browns for page-long resignation letter is itself a literary work of delusion for example while the liberal light-brown emphasizes a moderate and fiscally conservative approach he seems so disingenuous when he references Tanya Granick Allen while patch of brown talks a mean game about the PC party being a so-called big tent for everyone he says he disagrees fundamentally with Tanya but that she should nevertheless be welcomed in a broad-based PC party family forgive me if I take that statement with a shovel full of salt given the disrespectful way Brown has treated social conservatives these past two years also we would be remiss if we did not consider the timeline in terms of Brown's resignation after all just a day before his latest stunning announcement it was revealed that the ethics commissioner confirmed that Patrick Brown would be investigated this investigation was triggered by a complaint made by PC MPP Randy Hillier Hillier questioned how Brown could afford the mortgage on his 2.3 million dollar house and alleged that Brown violated the rules for MPPs by failing to declare all sources of income and then there's the smouldering dumpster fire that is the Hamilton West Ancaster Dundas rioting also just prior to his resignation the Toronto Star reported that Brown allegedly directed his top party officials to quote get me the result I want end quote this is a writing that is already the subject of a police investigation into alleged fraud and forgery naturally in the delusional biosphere of Patrick Brown these damning reports are merely coincidental in terms of stepping down he's simply doing what's right for the party and he wants to take the stress off his family and friends how endearing to see such self-sacrifice but is anyone buying this but there's got to be someone who is even more delusional than patch of brown in the province of Ontario namely now that Brown has officially exited the leadership race he forfeits that $100,000 deposit I have no idea who put up that money for brown thinking that this glue factory nag would rise phoenix-like into a thoroughbred stallion that would win the PC leadership race but whoever you are that put up this six-figure cheque please see a psychiatrist immediately for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks have you heard the rebel has a brand new app pleased unloaded and take the rebel wherever you go you
