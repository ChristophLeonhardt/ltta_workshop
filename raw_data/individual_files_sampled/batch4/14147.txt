rumored a federal oil sands exemption for alberta meaningless and it's a column by our friend Lorne Gunter who joins us now via Skype now having an exemption for the oil sands for in 2018 for any regulation or policy that's to use another dumb analogy that's closing the barn door after the horses left we've already lost a hundred billion dollars in investment it ain't coming back because you have a new exemption is it Lauren no no and and but that's not why I called it meaning if you're going to exempt the oil sands from federal emission regulation that's not a bad thing the alberta standards that ottawa is said to be allowing as an alternative they're not very good either but they're not as harsh as the federal one so honey you know you you it's better to be hit over to had four times or twice you know where work settling for getting headed hit over the head twice but they're meaningless because the feds are not changing their new rules about pipelines and about a mission analysis gender analysis indigenous traditional knowledge analysis they're not changing any of that and so it doesn't matter how much bitumen we can mine out of the oil sands if we can't ship it anywhere it's useless good and i think that this is a political trade-off I think the Liberals are saying wow you know we have to have to sort of appease the pro development people we have to appease business minded people we spend a whole nine months dumping on business people with with the claim that they were all tax cheats and they needed to be squeezed harder so we need to show ourselves to be somewhat in favor of development where we know that there's a whole bunch of billions tens of billions a hundred billion in investment that's gone elsewhere money that's been picked up and pulled out of Canada because of so we have to start showing some sort of deference to development hey let's give the Alberta government a win too and say you can use your standards for future oil sands developments you don't have to use art yeah but so long as you can't build a pipeline and with under the new federal rules you cannot you're never gonna be able to build a new pipeline so long as you can't build a pipeline developing the oil sands is meaningless it's useless you you know you can build a giant flare in in Fort McMurray that can be seen from space but that's about all you could do that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
