the war on free speech is so clear I find it amusing almost when I see the left try to deny this while also confirming it inevitably in any interview you see they will say hey we're just not for abusing people are you for abusing people both attacking the person's character while also admitting that yes we are censoring ideas we hate under the guise of caring it is a war on speech but more simply a war on conservative ideas a recent example of this was conservative comedian Owen Benjamin who was thrown in Twitter jail on January 5th what was his crime against the Twitter world you asked he held some radical ideas that children that should not be given hormones and transitioned into the opposite sex before they have the cognitive awareness to even walk across the street safely without holding their parents hand he also had the audacity to think that Islam was not colouring of women's rights or homosexual freedoms this also is confirmed by every major poll around the world and just generally not bending the knee to the political agenda of 2018 unfortunately this is the norm if say Linda Sarsour posted a clip of her calling for jihad on America and that clip got taken down by Twitter then there would be a mainstream media outcry why is it okay it's because it fits the mainstream media's narrative and why would it make national news because it would never happen also I wonder how many people generally agree with Owen Benjamin stance probably a lot I wonder how many of those people will physically attack transgender people or attack Muslim Americans in the street I would say zero because it's so rare and the media would love to cover that I wonder how many people were killed after calling for jihad last year thousands and why does this egregious tact that is then endorsed by a public figure with hundreds of thousands of followers not condemned or thrown in Twitter jail because it's all part of the plan that's a joke I would say it is now the accepted norm and if we as freedom-loving free speech activists Western civilization and loving people allow and do not speak out against actions like this then we surrender those actions to be normalized one person one comedian like Owen Benjamin being censored for a mainstream acceptable opinion cannot be accepted I graduate student like Lindsey Shepherd simply giving both sides to a well-known debate and being brought in front of a Human Rights Tribunal cannot be accepted or normalized an incredible professor like Jordan Peterson being branded and labeled and all trite white supremacist by mainstream media because he's speaking out against the government forcing down their own ideas and using laws to enforce speech that they deem is okay is not right and will not be accepted war on freedom of speech freedom of expression we cannot allow these shots over the bow to continue we can't allow one of these instances to go without resistance no now no more I say no more of this in 2018 hashtag free the bear free Owen Benjamin I'm Ben Davies this is pure Hollywood all right if you like this video and others like it please consider becoming a premium member to the rebel that way you'll have first access to pure Hollywood and the entire rebel lineup
