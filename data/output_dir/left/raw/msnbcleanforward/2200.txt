THEY NEVER THOUGHT OF BEFORE. IT WASN’T SOMETHING THEY WERE

72
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:07,819
IT WASN’T SOMETHING THEY WERE COMMITTED TO.

73
00:02:07,862 --> 00:02:08,886
COMMITTED TO. NOW IT’S A COMMITMENT.

74

NATO COUNTRIES HAD ALREADY COMMITTED TO THAT NUMBER BACK IN

86
00:02:27,015 --> 00:02:28,906
COMMITTED TO THAT NUMBER BACK IN 2006 AND FRANCE’S EMMANUEL

00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:33,511
2006 AND FRANCE’S EMMANUEL MACRON SAYS NO ONE AGREED TO THE

88
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,245
MACRON SAYS NO ONE AGREED TO THE 2% NUMBER.

89
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:35,780
2% NUMBER. ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT SAID THE

00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,881
ALTHOUGH THE PRESIDENT SAID THE PAYMENTS WOULD COME QUICKLY, IT

91
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:38,416
PAYMENTS WOULD COME QUICKLY, IT WAS NOT CLEAR THIS WOULD HAPPEN

92
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,785
WAS NOT CLEAR THIS WOULD HAPPEN ANY SOONER THAN THE ALREADY

93
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,421
ANY SOONER THAN THE ALREADY AGREED UPON TARGET, WHICH IS

94
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,188
AGREED UPON TARGET, WHICH IS 2024.

95
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,523
2024. NEVERTHELESS, THE PRESIDENT SAID

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:51,329
AND THAT NATO WILL BE BETTER FOR IT.

100
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,997
IT. TAKE A LOOK.

101
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,932

103
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,035
STRONG ALLY. AS TOGETHER IT’S MUCH STRONGER

104
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,037
AS TOGETHER IT’S MUCH STRONGER THAN OBVIOUSLY INDIVIDUAL

105
00:02:59,047 --> 00:02:59,404
THAN OBVIOUSLY INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES.

106
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,306
COUNTRIES. I THINK IT’S THE WAY WE HAVE IT

107
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:01,539
I THINK IT’S THE WAY WE HAVE IT NOW.

108
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,841
NOW. I THINK IT’S A MUCH -- I THINK

109
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:05,677
I THINK IT’S A MUCH -- I THINK NATO GOT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WAS

110
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,444
NATO GOT -- YOU KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH SPENDING PART OF

111
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,313
HAPPENING WITH SPENDING PART OF MY GETTING INTO OFFICE.

112
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,614
MY GETTING INTO OFFICE. THE NUMBERS WERE GOING DOWN.

113
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:10,915
THE NUMBERS WERE GOING DOWN. NOW THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP

114
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:12,216
NOW THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP LIKE A ROCKET SHIP.

115
00:03:12,227 --> 00:03:13,752
LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP A LOT.

116
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:16,154
THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP A LOT. AND THEY’VE GONE UP RAPIDLY.

117
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,355
AND THEY’VE GONE UP RAPIDLY. AND THEY’RE NOW GOING UP

118
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:17,689
AND THEY’RE NOW GOING UP FURTHER.

119
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:19,924
FURTHER. SO I THINK NATO’S GOING TO BE

120
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:21,960
SO I THINK NATO’S GOING TO BE VERY, VERY EFFECTIVE.

121
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,129
VERY, VERY EFFECTIVE. >> DESPITE THE PRESIDENT’S

134
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:44,983
THERE’S A BETTER SPIRIT FOR NATO RIGHT NOW THAN PERHAPS THEY’VE

135
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:45,584
