I love puppies
that's definitely like a country artist
its Gwen Stefani what she's got at wing
and even if at first you don't like
wanted to work on you it's still like
works on you it's got a good vibe and I
like that whole loving my best friend
kind of thing yes we
the song has a lot going on it doesn't
seem to me to reflect the vibe of
Christmas and it also just kind of seems
like they just like put a song and put
some guitars on it and put some sleigh
bells on it and said the word Christmas
I like like magic and my Christmas songs
and like fire and the cold outside then
it has to be pure pure joy otherwise it
just becomes the sound of capitalism
do you remember Hanson mm-hmm that's
know they're so sweet you guys are
great I'm sorry that I trashed your
Christmas song that has the Christmas
spirit in it that's got a lot of joy in
it I just want him to sing everything
now he's hilarious
this is SIA whom I love she brings so
much authenticity to what she sings but
on this Christmas song
I don't feel the Christmas spirit then
again I'm Jewish but then again most
Christmas songs were written by Jews so
I've made a full circle back I am a true
authority on Christmas songs but as far
as just like feeling that Christmas
spirit now I'll probably just put on
that King coal
you
