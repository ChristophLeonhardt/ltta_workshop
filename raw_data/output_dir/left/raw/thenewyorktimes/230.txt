2
00:00:00,625 --> 00:00:03,570
This is the story of
the tiny rove beetle —

3
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,235
a little-studied insect that
mimics ants and termites

4
00:00:06,235 --> 00:00:10,000
to live in and prey on
their colonies undetected —

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,930
and a boy, Joe Parker, who
turned a childhood passion

6
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,820
into a scientific
quest to understand

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:19,120
the extraordinary evolutionary
journey of these beetles.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,280
Parker discovered the world
of insects and the rove beetle

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,410
at a very young age.

10
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,410
“I have been really
interested in insects

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,540
since I was a small child.

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,650
All of the rest of
the world fell away,

13
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,530
and it was just me and insects.”

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:43,340
The beetles — beautiful
under a microscope —

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,870
are common in Wales,
where he grew up.

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,670
But it’s the way
some species have

17
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,390
evolved that made Parker commit
his life’s work to the insects.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,830
Here’s how it went.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,380
Ancestral rove beetles
entered colonies

20
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,650
to prey on ants or termites
using their chemical gland

21
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,850
for defense.

22
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,300
The approach was classic —

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,470
enter, attack, escape.

24
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:05,640
But over time,
some beetle species

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,680
evolved a sneakier approach.

26
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,600
They began to live
in the colonies,

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,850
masquerading as
termites or ants.

28
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,370
“If you can get your foot in
the door of an ant colony,

29
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,940
there are no other predators.

30
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,120
It’s climatically controlled.

31
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,640
It’s full of
resources, so you can

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,420
feed on the ant brood and
food that the ants have harvested

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,010
to your heart’s content.”

34
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:27,930
What allowed the beetles
to survive in the ant

35
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,450
colonies were major evolutionary
changes in body and behavior.

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,150
The defensive gland at
the end of the abdomen

37
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,670
evolved to produce chemicals
that made the beetles smell

38
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,140
like colony members.

39
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,690
Instead of harming the
ants, they tricked them.

40
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,260
In some cases, the ants were
even drawn to the smell.

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,420
And their bodies
were transformed.

42
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,550
Legs and antennae grew longer.

43
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,170
Their abdomen slimmed.

44
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,560
The result — they came
to resemble the ants.

45
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,050
Even more surprising
is that this

46
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:02,400
wasn’t a single event passed
on from one ancestral line.

47
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,290
It happened many times.

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,710
Over millions of years, at
least 12 separate lineages

49
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,780
of rove beetles
have independently

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,060
gone through the
same transformation,

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,280
from a free-roaming
solitary beetle

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,520
to a social insect living
with ants or termites.

53
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,830
The big question is what
genetic changes caused

54
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,440
these transformations,
and this is the part

55
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,060
that really excites Parker.

56
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,190
“There’s clearly
something special

57
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,520
about these beetles compared
to almost all other forms

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,590
of animal life that
kind of poises them,

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,220
predisposes them evolutionarily
to be able to do this.”

60
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,710
He now has his sights set
on mapping and comparing

61
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,740
the genes of many
rove beetle species.

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,320
The research could
provide some deep insights

63
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,240
into the nature of evolution —

64
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,540
the process that has made
both beetles and humans who

65
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,010
we are today.

66
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,500
And it all started with
a childhood passion.
