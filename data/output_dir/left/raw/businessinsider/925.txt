whether Trump Tower was wiretapped what

<font color="#E5E5E5">I can say is there are many ways to</font>

surveil each other now<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunately you</font>

may be those there was an article<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

8
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,250
week that talked about how you can

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,379
surveil someone through their phones

10
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,629
through there certainly through their

television sets any number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways and microwaves that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn into</font>

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:09,270
cameras etc I was dancing a question

14
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,040
about surveillance techniques generally

15
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,600
I was reflecting what people fall in the

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,799
news last week which were several

17
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,229
articles about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can surveil each</font>

18
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,990
other generally the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've given</font>

19
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,290
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> President and wiretapping in</font>

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,240
Trump Tower is very simple and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it</font>

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,650
many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> including this morning on</font>

22
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,270
other networks so that screaming

23
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:29,130
headline doesn't even reach the quote in

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,930

28
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,009
really was about surveillance generally

29
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:39,780
and the fact that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>
