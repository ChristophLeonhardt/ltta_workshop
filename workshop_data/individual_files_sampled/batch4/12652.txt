uses me with happiness cuz you're a happy person so let's talk a little bit about your background so for folks who don't know christina hoff sommers she's the feminist that feminists loved hate because you actually say factual things about males and females and sex differences and and the hot topics today we'll get to all those hot topics but first let's talk about how you got where you are politically because you weren't always conservative in fact in some areas you still don't consider yourself a conservative so how did you go from being kind of just an academic professor to being one of the most well-known foes of the of the modern feminist movement well I first of all I was brought up in LA not far from here I went to university high school and I guess in Brentwood and I was very left-wing and especially in high school I read the Communist Manifesto and it all made sense it seems so right of course to each according to his need from each according to his ability it was just kindness and so I was quite carried away with that for a while and then I don't know in college I ever met I remain not a Marxist but just my default mode was always liberal my parents very very liberal bordering on Communists but then in 1988 I was a professor a college professor and I was invited to go on semester at sea it's a ship that goes around the world and it's a university at sea and so somehow I got on this thing and I was teaching and I guess I was I'd been teaching maybe for 10 years or something but I had never sat in my fellow professor's courses before and so this ship was about 500 undergrads mostly conservatives as far as I could tell from USC SMU pretty wealthy you know mom and dad could afford to send jr. on a trip around the world and the professor's were socialist to Marxist and so I started to bicker with them and in this course we had called core and I suddenly and then suddenly at the end of the trip this older professor was very left-wing warned me you better be careful you're gonna end up being just like Jean Kirkpatrick and I didn't know she was I looked her up and thought I think I like her maybe I am and she was at AEI and I ended up at AEI but anyway it was kind of accidental I think if I hadn't got on that ship I might not have known what was going on in other people's courses okay so what happened to academia so even that can even for a long time have you seen active changes in the way that academia has operated since the 80s or do you think that it's been pretty consistent it's just more well known because of social media now in terms of the sort of radical leftist dominance even in in some of the hard sciences in terms of shutting down debate and an investigation into knowledge it's gotten worse and worse and here's why it used to be the universities always you know stret tends to be liberal however a lot there's a lot of radicals that came out of the 70s late 60s 70s for various reasons went into the universities it was the one institution that you could take your radical politics and find a home there and they did they were more radical than the liberal professors who hired them the liberal professors who hired them might have believed in intellectual diversity so maybe they would have allowed some conservatives and moderates and had some radicals the radicals didn't think the same way so as the older scholars retired and the young radicals gained a foothold in in many departments I mean certainly women's studies they were always there and the various you know ethnic studies but even in political science departments history to her certainly English departments there they would start hiring their own and and a limit you know just not invite anyone else to come to the campus so you had certain departments become like-minded people like-minded thinkers and they did not present the other side respectfully and they didn't want to have candidates come in if you came in and appeared to be conservative or even moderate you wouldn't get hired so it's so the professor's have become more radical and I also think if you look at the schools of Ed people don't think about schools of Ed what's the curriculum there it's it's very left-wing and so we have a lot of teachers who are trained in liberal left orthodoxy going into our junior high schools and high schools so so you have had a transformation of the educational system so you call yourself a factual feminist how do you define feminism because obviously a lot of feminists would accuse you of not being a feminist because you don't agree the sort of prevailing left-wing trends inside feminism so what do you think true feminism is and then how is it being abused the trans determine expanded abused by some of the folks on the left well I think a true feminist is an equity feminist and that's just someone who believes he wants for women what she wants her ever I mean dignity equality opportunity liberty and equity feminism has been a great American success story I mean if you look at the progress women have made and just open you know doors have opened and women wherever women wanted to go they've gone they were there now more women than men in college and in certain disciplines in psychology veterinary medicine these used to be overwhelmingly male and now women are taking over in many of the social sciences where women want to go they they went there they've achieved parity with men are approaching parity in law school and medical school so there's been enormous change to which and I credit equity feminism just equality feminism where you just don't have arbitrary barriers against women but there's another school of feminism entirely that is not part of this kind of classical liberal tradition of greater opportunities for people this is what I have called gender feminism because they believe in what they call the sex gender system and that women are not merely held back by old-fashioned laws or customs it's not enough to change the society the entire system must be taken down that you know and and so it's a much more radical approach and they they think of American women as an oppressed class of people and and when and so after I was on that ship and I had there was some radical feminists there too I wrote a piece about what I experienced on that ship called professor at sea and I sent it to the Atlantic and the editor Rupe and I'd written about the feminist sonship who were very colorful and extreme and you know we were seeing the whole world and and we've come into ports and the the students could go and see some of the glories of civilization the Alhambra you know they could go to Seville and they would take them to wedding stores to see how the wedding industry oppressed Spanish women and things like so I just heard about this and Michael Curtis this editor at the Atlantic said I can't really use the piece that you wrote but the way you talked about the this is so different so interesting and you're doing it as a feminist and he said I'd like you to write about that and that later became my book who stoled feminism so in the book who stole feminism I pointed out that there are these two traditions and that one of them is everyone should be every contemporary American should be an equity feminist and we have pretty good data which shows they are most people believe in equal pay for equal work and they want their daughters and sons to have the same opportunities so equity feminism I believe that we owe most of women's progress to that classical liberal tradition that came in really from the European enlightenment gender feminism does not come out of the European enlightenment as such it's more of a Marxist tradition conflict theory class struggle but in this case gender struggle are now intersectional struggles so I I just can't view American women as subordinate I think it's a complicated mix of for men and women of benefits and burdens I don't think women are oppressed as women well why do you think gender feminism has gained so much credence and credibility American women are living the best lives the women who ever lived in the history of the world by a pretty large margin why is it that this sort of toxic feminism to use a good hijack attorney hey why is it the dad has has gained so much ground in the public discourse well as I said it gained a foothold in the Academy and particularly in women's studies so it's sort of a one-party system and if you are a dissident feminist and you could be a feminist you could be a scholar you can be a Laura Kipnis or a Katie Roy feat Christina summers it can be a poly mi but all of us have been critical of aspects of radical feminism then you become persona non grata you become part of the problem part of the systemic oppression of women you've become an agent of the patriarchy and they just call you names so you don't get hired you're you're materials aren't taught so students are we have now you know going back 20 years graduates in the more elite school the more likely in their gender studies you know they're very adamantly teaching these these rather extreme theories about women's oppression and they use propaganda phony statistics and so we have lots of young people coming out becoming bloggers becoming you know activists who've never heard the other side they've read it in their textbooks they've heard it look that whole worldview was reinforced now its truth they looked at the real world it doesn't seem to match but it you know it's not majority majority of students don't become angry feminists but enough to and now they're moving into the ends of the society what do you think of the idea that this is part and parcel of the the hunger for a sense of victimology that seems to be kind of crossing all political boundaries it now applies to a lot of people on all sides of the political ally of folks who think they're victims of foreign trade people stealing their jobs you have people who think that they're victims of an overarching racist American system and now you have women who again are living in an extraordinarily privileged time by any dimension by any measure and it was opportunity rich women in history and and then there and but they've had to come up with some framework in which they are victims how much of this do you think is actually prosperity eating itself is just a prosperous group of people who have decided that they have to maintain some sense of victimhood in order to give them a sense of purpose in the world it could be that it's a you know I don't want to speculate too much about their psychology because I'm just not sure and there's and I even worry about that sometimes they worry like why aren't there more dissident scholars like me and it fills me with doubt I think maybe there's something wrong with me maybe maybe I am an agent of the patriarchy and I'm not saying it and so then I try to go back and read it and try it and think okay I've missed something and maybe maybe women really are oppressed in some hidden way that I can't appreciate now I've looked pretty carefully as well as a lot along with a lot of other people if things like the wage gap in the glass ceiling and I just can't help but see they're just other reasonable explanations that have nothing to do with discrimination but I honestly try because it worries me that so many of them are carried away with it and you know why wouldn't there be more people protesting and more scholar they're not that many women scholars that join me that's starting to change now I think they've gotten so extreme that maybe I will have more company but anyway why do they believe it I mean it's it's a conspiracy theory for smart people and you know and the more intelligent you are this is there's been good you know psychological documentation that just the more you can talk yourself into a belief system and maybe they you know had a bad experience and they're projecting I don't know I know you know Catherine MacKinnon who was sort of the leader of the gender feminist movement and you know she thought that the patriarchal oppressive system was so good it was almost perfect so perfect that people couldn't even see it it was invisible that's one of the other things you know now that could be a profound observation and some people found it so not me I found it to be a paranoid conspiracy theory about reality that can't be falsified it can't test it as soon as you question it that just shows your part of the problem you know but Catherine MacKinnon she did not win in the beginning when she first came on the scene and the New York Times was covering academia and New York magazine and LA Times my side was winning we won in the court of public opinion can the Oh Polly uh you know was certain she was on covers and things we just we won the argument they won the assistant professorship and that mattered more so let's go through some of the myths that have been pervade by the modern feminist movement because you spend an awful lot of time doing that but first let's talk about your online security so whether you are in a cafe or hotel we often rely on public Wi-Fi to use the internet on the go but something as simple as paying your bills online from the Starbucks can

secure your internet right now is it expressvpn comm slash Ben to learn more ok so let's go back to these myths so myth number one the wage gap which you mentioned this is used by virtually every feminist scholar to suggest that America has some sort of superstructure of patriarchy what are the real facts about the wage gap does it exist and if so to what extent there is a gap of about 20 cents if you look at all men and all women working full time you will find this gap however it doesn't take into account relevant factors that affair just what did you major in in college what profession are you in how many hours do you work per week when you do these controls the wage gap begins to narrow and in some studies it vanishes so if you look at majors college majors you will make more money on average if you go into I don't know petroleum engineering or naval architecture or metallurgy apparently make money and for the PhD in metallurgy but if you go into early childhood education Social Work or women's studies met not as much so that counts and oh you know then we look well who majors in petroleum engineering it's mostly men and who majors in early childhood education mostly women so that is not you know you have to take into account these relevant factors and what I see in study after study is they either don't do it or they play a little game like the American Association of University Women they will say oh yes it's true when you take relevant you know factors into control it narrows but there's still a gap and then they insist but of you know they'll say 12 sir 15 cents but but they don't take all of the relevant factors because there probably took 20 or 25 things I mean look at things like the danger of a job if you look at the the death gap it's almost all men I think it's 94 percent of fatalities in the workplace our men Labor Department data and every year you know so we've got about 5,000 people who died in the workplace almost all men so that's another thing they never look at the workplace as a totality what jobs are people doing and most of the gritty dangerous jobs you know have you've seen a woman like as a roofer or if you're in a high-rise building and there's some guy out there it's always a guy rushing the windows and you know so there's a you do get a pay premium for a danger you do get a pay premium for working odd hours or strange hours now when I debate them they'll say yes okay fine you're right but it's still discrimination because why is it that men take those jobs and women take their jobs and why are women's jobs degraded and so forth well that's an interesting question but they've now changed the focus of the argument because we're not talking about equal pay for equal work we're now talking about they sort of want comparable pay for similar work or you know or they want the society to you know do something about the fact that women do I mean the main reason women earn less is that when women have kids they tend to withdraw or you know work less and when men have kids they work more so they'll say well why is that that's sexism well again we're no longer talking about employers and we're no while are we talking about you know a wage gap that is because some evil employers are deliberately paying men more it's they change the ground but even when you go there and ask why do people do what they do and you know is it a sex role sort of thing that's a different set of arguments but even their their arguments are not persuasive because if I look at the patriarchy and say okay that's my hypothesis that we were we do what we do we've all been conditioned under patriarchy and then I see the United States is less patriarchal than it's ever been women are constantly encouraged to do all sorts of things in schools little kids are encouraged to play with all sorts of toys but the kids insist the kids are the ones that you know are jet you know they stereotyped themselves and you even see the kinds of play little girls with dolls the feminists have been very upset by that because they think that that conditions them to be mothers and we should bond little boys with dolls well they've tried that and then the little boys will you know turn them I've been to conferences where there they'll cry to say well yes I tried to use bubbles and dolls and get the boys to play and then they turn them into torpedoes you know this and and by the way that the gender feminists don't like it when I bring up you know any of us bring up those examples because they still think it's conditioning it's good well maybe it was conditioning that made them gender feminists I mean then we get into an argument free will and determinism and we changed the ground again into this meta in an interesting argument about ultimate freedom of self-determination but I think that we have to at this point credit women with agency when they choose what they're gonna major in when they choose the field if they want to stay home with kids then I think that it's Mattern izing to suggest that they aren't responsible for their own lives and this is one of the funniest things about these particular statistics you look at nations like Norway which have tried to forcibly disabuse people of the patriarchy and in some of those nations there's a much larger pay gap than there is in some of the developing nations where women are actually forced to work jobs that they don't want to it turns out that when women are prosperous it would very often less like to work those jobs where they're dealing with heavy equipment and not being able to be home with their kids well you just yeah the end people have done surveys on preferences like what would you like what would be your ideal situation and over and over again you find the following and this was Catherine Hakim at the London formally at the London School of Economics the Pew Research Center has found that if you ask women in the United States about 20% want to work full-time they want to be high-powered careers that's a number-one priority 20 percent would like to be full-time stay-at-home mothers they do not wish to be in the workplace and they will not be there unless something no misfortune and they have to and then 60% are called adapters they they are women who want want to work part-time when they have little kids and then you know go back and forth 60% and actually the 60% behave a little more like the stay-at-home moms and their preferences and choices so you have 20 percent of women who do want what you know the AAUW and the MS foundation and now what they're pushing they do a good job pushing for the interests of that 20 percent of careerists but what if most women aren't like that and shouldn't that count and they will never say it counts because they will think that their preferences were shaped by patreon right I mean if they're honest about their like Betty Ford and they actually look for compulsion of itself is reinstituting the paper that was similar before sorry you're right yeah maybe freed and if everyday was not consistent but I I read I've reviewed both of their books recently and found a lot that I liked hello Simone de Beauvoir was kind of she was actually onon feta means and not sleeping chain-smoking and she rich just went into the bibliothèque nationale and wrote everything everything you know it's a manic I think anyway but she did she did very harsh things to say about motherhood but she certainly did not have harsh things to say about love affairs and her you know she frustrated the feminist by saying you know the most important thing in her life was jean-paul Sartre and well why do you think it is that the feminist movement has decided to obliterate sex differences because seems like that's what it comes down to is that a lot of this is preference based I mean if you go back to biology itself I mean there are studies of rhesus monkeys that show that female rhesus monkeys prefer dolls and male rhesus monkeys prefer weapons like this right this is this is deeply embedded in evolutionary biology because it was the job of females typically to have babies and then raise them and it was the job of men to go out and protect the mother so that they could raise the babies because otherwise everybody would die no this is pretty deeply about it when did it become the the mission of the feminist movement to say that there is something fundamentally wrong if women and men have separate preferences because it seems like this has infused so much of our conversation now about men and women well I think they did it for a few reasons one is there was a time where any woman who defied the stereotypes of femininity let's go back in 30s and 40s 50s then she for her these were it was you know a stall to fiying conformity was it what was enforced so I think initially that you know feminists just wanted to break down these stereotypes because maybe as many as 20% of women did not embody them now I think that's fine and that's what I feminism is but equity feminism's are also about freedom that what you you take down the barriers but then women should be allowed to do be who they are and those of us who embody traditional stereotypes and that's just who we are and we would prefer to look workless when we have kids or we prefer to go into you know my field of in philosophy I studied I got my PhD and my dissertation was in the area of ethics and that's just a field you will find more women in philosophy doing esthetics and ethics then say philosophy of mathematics it's more men so those were the choices that I make and why isn't why as that problematized you know you take down the barriers and then you see what people do and you do the best you can in your educational system and parenting and I think we do I think a lot of us of our child I mean I have two boys who majored in English I tried to talk them out of it and but they were defying the stereotype of you know I told them they should major in engineering yeah and my wife obviously is famously a doctor so she's in the stem ya field and my daughter is totally into it she walks around the house saying that her brother is going to be a radio host like daddy and she is going to be in the sciences like mommy yeah so I obviously agree with the basic idea that in America pretty much everybody is raising their kids or at least a huge majority of people are raising their kids to basically do what they want to do and if your kid wants to if your daughter wants to be a scientist I don't see a lot of fathers who are standing in the doorway like John Lithgow in Footloose saying you're not allowed to go study chemistry now feminists on that they they had these phony ads I think they ran them in the Super Bowl one year when it went kind of feminist and you know they have a dad saying Oh put that away you know you you know and give her a doll and she wanted to play with her microscope you know as if that happens very often but anyway that that was one reason one is that I think that they wanted to liberate people that were forced into the rule and then they didn't realize that that might not be liberating for everybody you want to liberate the people that don't like it not not the not human nature as we experience it there was a second reason is that historically there have been a lot of disparaging and false things said about women that held women back so women you know my field and philosophy is among the worst few read Nietzsche or Kant and it's endless just all sorts of you know generalizations about the females the fair sex and how you know we couldn't didn't have the the stem for a court of law and you know all sorts of things so I think feminism just a lot of women just developed a tremendous intolerance for for generalizations but again that what they should have done is allowed that currently like people define themselves and that you will find that there is a tendency for women you know to behave in certain ways and to make have certain preferences people made a lot of money you know making television shows and magazines for that market if you look at you don't they don't say in most stores now men's magazines women but you kind of know if you go and the women's you know typically there'll be children or you know faces and men there's a lot of stuff you know it'll be a race car the cars and and it just you know it's a again that's that what we see in the vervet monkeys and the rhesus monkeys the the little the male will go for the gadget and the female for the doll now it's not a hundred percent there are little girls that are gonna go for the gadget probably even with the monkeys but there's also the norm and I think it's the thing is yes it is intolerant to force a kid who defies the stereotype of his or her sex force them to conform but it's also intolerant to to take a gender conforming kid and force them to do what they don't want to do and to force a boy to play with the doll if he doesn't want to and one of the things that's been really fascinating to watch is how the transgender movement has turned all of this on its head because the transgender movement has basically now suggested that men and women being as feminist claims exactly the same a man can actually be a woman so long as he claims that he's a woman and this has led to a bizarre backlash from people like to remain Grier who have said wait hold on a second there is something special about being a woman after all and we're not just going to admit biological men into our category because they say they ought to be admitted to that category well I I have yet to hear a coherent explanation of I mean I'm mark I'm more tolerant trans than you are and mainly because for for one reason at AEI one of the first trans people that I met was Deirdre McCloskey there's my favorite economist philosopher I haven't seen her lately but she it was just so impressive and I just read her book and her story and I think there is a legitimate human rights issue there however and I think she would agree with that it's all been politicized and you have people that may not even be trans but who are wannabes or pretend I mean there's some and who you know or it won't allow anything to be debated or discussed and you're constantly getting getting into fights and I people used to attack me by saying Christina Hoff Sommers and and Margaret Thatcher those two female impersonators someone criticized me as a female impersonator and it happened on tumblr a few months ago and they got called out for using the phrase female impersonator and acting as though that was a criticism vindicated by that and just think I don't ask you about some more of the myths that have been pervade by sort of the feminist culture but first let's talk about the quality of your sleep there's nobody on the planet like you so why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else helix sleep builds a sleep quiz that takes two minutes to complete they using the answers to match your body type and

and inflated right in front of us we pop sit on the bed frame it's good to go it's so nice that my sister got one for her wedding as well helix sleep calm slash been guest and he had a hundred twenty-five bucks off your mattress order right now again helix sleep calm slash at been guest back to you some of the myths that are being pervade so one of the big ones that you've taken on is the myth that America has a deep-seated rape culture and I've always been sort of bewildered as to what exactly people mean when they say rape culture like is there some vast group of men out or very pro rape that I've been missing somehow and is there in fact some sort of rape culture that's happening on campuses what are the actual facts with regard to the idea that America is in the midst of a rape culture right now well first of all for them a rape culture is a society that is supportive and encouraging of you know male predation and they would say that that just it's just ubiquitous and in films and songs and and they will point to a song like remember blurred lines no you want yeah and so they take that line I know you want it I know you want it and then that's rape culture that's a man in intimating that you know no matter what she says it but then you know other people would point out that there were a lot of songs even songs I think even Beyonce had a song that said that and so it's never quite it doesn't you know I try to find this culture because to me it looks like we're a culture properly so that is that despises rapists there I mean there they're there with murderers and child molesters rapists the low you know lowest cycle of hell there's and that's why it's very important to have due process because it's such a serious allegation because we have little tolerance so I don't and and then look at American society and you look at the data and you see that all violent crime has gone down no one knows quite why but lots of theories but rape and sexual assault it's down except on the campus when they do these studies that are flawed so they have it's called advocacy research you can prove anything if you rig the study and how do you get one in four I'll tell you how you go to a college campus and you you administer maybe over online you have a survey with some vaguely worded questions and you ask them to a non representative group of people and then you know you can project into the whole school or the whole town or the whole world a rape epidemic now fortunately we have very good statisticians in the Justice Department the Bureau of Justice Statistics they don't have an agenda they just want to do good research and they do an annual crime survey and for one time I think was 2010 they they actually pulled out the data on campus and they found that they didn't in it nothing like one in four they found more like I think one in fifty three now that is still high it's still a problem we've got a binge drinking culture we've got you know a lot of things going on and could be improved and sexual harassment and assault is a problem but it's not an epidemic it's not like the worst crisis I mean who would send a child who would send a girl to Stanford or Berkeley you know at Harvard if she you know and people are lining up to get in there who would send a child there if there was a one in four chance that she was going to be a victim of this serious sexual crime so I didn't know people don't really believe it but yet it's taught and it's I think it's almost now a contagion of hysteria and so you're getting more and more young women are just so frightened and and I look at like swathmore you know the girls are frightened of these swathmore these be it these elite schools and then I mean now I'm not saying there can't be boorish behavior and the you know boys should be gentlemen and ladies and the girls should be ladies all of that but there's no you can't find it it was manufactured through a combination of twisted theories about the patriarchy and propaganda I mean they are in a gender war in it in every war the first casualty is truth this one is no different it seems like the Boers have been completely removed I mean the these studies that I've seen word they're suggesting numbers like one and four basically they're conflating anything from an unwanted touch to a full-on rape and then saying that that is all part of a rape epidemic happening on campus and that's led to these essentially Stalinist show trials that are happening on campuses across the country with no due process of law that seems to me a lot more dangerous as an institution for a college then the notion that the college is somehow winking and nodding at actual rape happening on his campus absolutely and the sad thing is that you're absolutely right now they have these show trials and and they say oh well women never make makeup the accusations you have to believe women you women do make up accusations and and women do lie not because they are women because they are human and human beings will you know sometimes lie especially about sex we just had a case at Sacred Heart did you read about that I miss this one oh my goodness there was a trial and these two young men athletes were thrown out you know they were accused thrown off the team lost scholarships it went on on finally in court she admitted she made it up I think it was sort of like the Jackie case at University of Virginia that rolling stone case she made it up because she wanted her boyfriend wannabe to feel sorry for either she had some reason and they they allowed these young men or it was one of them I saw making a statement about what had had done to his life and it was it was horrifying you know he just said you know it's it's it's ruinous it's just psychologically really a false accusation and and there's a reason we have due process and this we developed this this truth finding apparatus it's the best we've got it's not perfect but there's but what's much worse is not to have it and now on campuses they've dispensed with it in many cases and you have people accused and found guilty of very serious crimes that you know there's no no jury would have found them guilty there wasn't evidence there's some case there's no evidence in some cases there was evidence that proved it didn't happen and in these tribunals they wouldn't accept it so I and I but I also feel sorry for girls who have been victims because now it's this crime has been exaggerated all proportions so you know at some schools if a boy walks by and says nice legs you know a girl call that it's in the feminist center that's a mini rape you know they're appropriating the language of predation and violence for you know everyday things that go on and so I think they're trivializing the terrible thing that can happen it because we do know that this can happen on campus and the and then they have procedures that nobody knows what's going on or where it leads so it's not helping anybody fortunately I think the current Department of Education just announced they're going to change the requirements for college and undo some of the the new rules that were put in by the last administration says someone who's been accused of catcalling for asking a woman to debate me publicly that's a I definitely understand they kind of broadening at the terminology what what do you think is sort of a solution for this because it seems like if you wanted to create a recipe for a bunch of false statistics and false positives in cases of rape what you would first do is suggest to men and women that there are no differences between men and women then you would tell them that to explore their best selves that they should have as much sex with as many partners as possible and then you'd put them alone as much as possible and then you would set no standards for what actually rape constitutes and finally you would say no evidence is necessary in order for us to convince you and you can do it all with infinite amount of alcohol we're not going to check right so it's always you know it's it's alcohol saturated so it seems like they've removed all the traditional standards and then they've decided to become prudes about the results of a lot of this stuff it's crazy you know there is an interesting case that just happened at NYU avital Ronell is a professor of German literature and complet she's a deconstructionist feminists and a performance artist so she goes into the class she has costumes and she tells the students this will not be classed as performance Adana and you know some of them were love it and a lot of them are probably bored or horrified or whatever it doesn't matter anyway she's a very very colorful celebrity scholar within this little niche world of performance scholarship and she's and she's apparently gay well now a gay guy nimrod reitman young he's about he well i don't know what he is now but he was maybe in his 20s when this happened this was a few years ago he's now accused her of sexual assault sexual harassment and he's gay she's a lesbian and and she's a leading figure you know and sort of postmodern deconstructionism so 50 leading feminist scholars gathered around her you know and wrote a letter excusing her and the letter looked like the kind of excuse people would give for Raymore something you know like oh it was a different time we really don't know what was happening and then it turns out she had an affair so she's a great interpreter of the philosopher Derrida yeah I think uh now it turns out she had an affair with his son when the son was 16 she was like a very bad lesbian she's not even who knows is it so anyway it's what it tells me is that sex you know it's complicated and who knows what went on with between these two people was it appropriate not really we have that she wrote a lot of texts and things but I can understand the people that love her that are on her side you know I've seen this with young men their families you know they see it differently because they're looking at it from his point of view and then she now has her you know she has got her side and the grad student has his side net and the whole Academy's now and all in a dither over this but to me maybe the only way we could find out would be in a court of law if and he is suing so maybe interesting we will see if she really wrote these things or said these things but it proved to the whole Academy the need for due process what bothers me about is I wish these 50 scholars had noticed that this was happening not just to their friend avital Ronell professor of but but it's been happening to young men and their campus it's happened to a lot of male professors where you're just run out of town and assumed guilty because accused I mean Laura Kipnis basically got shellacked at Northwestern for simply suggesting there'd be some sort of form of due process for a male professor who is accused of basically similar activity and she was investigated this professor was investigated for an article that she wrote in The Chronicle of Higher Education so it's out of control but you know what do we do about it I'm just hoping you know what I've done and that's what this who questioned me I'm not I'm not sure yeah I was gonna ask you what's the importance of the me to movement because obviously there's been a lot of focus on hashtag me too and people telling their stories and again it seems like there's a lot of conflation here where people say hashtag me too about I was once catcalled on the subway versus me too as in I was raped by a male relative or something and it's all supposed to be in the same category and then anybody who suggests differently is ripped up and down and I remember which after suggested recently that there were that there are gradations to severity of Matt Damon Matt Damon Matt Damon said that he was being interviewed I think of ABC News and he said he was he just seemed very nice and he said he cared about the movement and he liked a lot of good men liberal and conservative they are as horrified by it the Harvey Weinstein stories as anyone and he was like he says I care about that I want the movement to succeed however there are degrees of guilt and you know to some proportion in terms of punishment that's appropriate we he said you know patting someone on the ass isn't the same as rape and immediately his former co-star Minnie Driver and this new this angry woman thing you know angry woman on Twitter she starts screeching you know you you know there is a de what are you saying it's all bad he didn't say that it was good we just said there I mean this is fundamental to our legal and moral system that we make you know judgments as serious unless here she said she ruled it out of order and then she said Matt Damon should just you know basically told him to I can't STFU and you know he should shut up and to me this is gonna undo the movement because I do think that we have to bring relations between men and women up to 21st century standards in the workplace there was you know too much going on and making people unhappy but if something men and women should do together not make men the enemy you know it's good women and bad men know it's human beings improving the world together and that's what Matt Damon was trying to do and then he came out and said you know I'm just I'm not gonna say anything I know it's just time for me to listen and you know if Matt Damon and he had to do that I think because there was a petition and 30,000 me tours were trying to get him erased from his next film or yeah I mean the same thing happened or something similar happen to Henry Cavill who just suggested look in my personal life I'm a famous guy and when I go out for a date I have to worry about the fact that the person sitting across from me knows I'm rich and famous and so any false accusation could ruin my career and cost me millions of dollars so I'm more likely to go out with an ex-girlfriend who I at least know and trust then to date a new woman and he just got destroyed for it because how dare you see just something so logical was that right yeah you can't you men are just you know they have to keep quiet well that's not going to help and it's it's it's actually going to ruin the movement and now we have Weston him asiya Argento you know he's got a complicated story one of the things you learn when you study this is and I actually found it in this NYU case I read his he's suing and I read his complaint against avital Ronell and I thought ah she's a monster this poor point I felt so angry at her and protective of him and then someone published a letter that she wrote explaining her side and then I read it and thought hmm gee maybe maybe maybe he's he's really out of control and he's the crazy one and you could see both sides and I owe ya that's why we have trials if you're accused of something serious it's so I've learned that don't just go you can't just believe people that's you know courts of law show that people you know maybe misrepresent reality and so we have to sort it out so let's talk a little bit about some of the problems that women do face interviews we've talked about the idea of the wage gap being largely false the idea that there's a giant rape culture being largely false the the kind of overblowing of the me to movement not that women shouldn't come out everyone agrees a woman who is abused in some way should come forward and speak about we should all be on her side when there's evidence that this has happened but by the same token the way that they're pro it's being approached right now is deeply flawed and undermining the foundations of the movement what promise do you see women generally facing in the West or in the United States that you think people aren't talking about enough if any well the thing is that women's problems are talked about a lot because for good reason we had a women's movement we have lots of organizations everywhere and I actually see more problems for men right now and men don't have a lobby especially little boys and I wrote a book the war against boys what's happening with little boys in school so right now I'm the mainly concerned about the men and you know that the vast numbers of men and and the the boys that are dropping out of school the men that have not just dropped that aren't just unemployed they're not looking for work we've got you know able-bodied men in their prime earning years who are not in the workforce and we have an educational system that is not meeting the needs of men as well as women and and when I look at women's problems because women do have serious problems especially the feminization of poverty if you are alone with children it's very hard for women and given the job as women do and so it's they need men we need each other so I don't really see it as separate at this point I think we need kind of a an egalitarian movement and that looks at areas where we could help men because when you help men you help women at this point in the United States and and and if you help women you help man we need to we're in this together so the problem of poverty the problem of single motherhood and all that you've got us they've got to be marriage able men they've got to be guys and it's not enough just to it used to be you could graduate from high school and work hard you could make it into the middle class now you you almost required to have college beyond high school some specialization and far more women are getting that than men so we may end up closing the wage gap just by having a better educated women but socially that is not the projections are not good for a stable society it's not good for the workforce and other countries are addressing that problem so anyway I do see a problem the financial problem with women but I think it's connected to men the most serious problems for women though as you said they're not in the West I think they're many parts of the world where they have not had two major waves of feminism they haven't had so much as a trickle and I go to international women's conferences and I meet women coming from you know Somalia and Egypt and Iran which is a kind of you know talk about a Handmaid's Tale I mean that's like 1984 for women and in many ways that although it's terrible for men too but but I meet the women that are that are sort of the freedom fighters the the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan Anthony and Sojourner Truth of those countries and it's very exciting but American women right now especially on the campus who have so much to give and who are so gifted and you know there you are at Wellesley and you're at swath and they're turned in on their own oppression and not making common cause with these women around the world that didn't need help and they come to these conferences they want help from American women because we did liberate ourselves and they want to do the same and I don't understand why our women's movement wouldn't be so focused on making those connections and you know you go back in the 80s on the college campus with our part ID in South Africa and you know the students were very focused on the social justice in South Africa where are they today on gender apartheid in in you know Saudi Arabia or something they're mostly talking about apartheid gender apartheid in the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts or you know that we have separate you know the language is all about in of crisis for our society which is not a patriarchy no to come back to the United States for a second it seems to me one of the big problems that I've seen particularly among men since we're gonna talk about men is this feeling of a lack of purpose and that seems like that's been exacerbated a lot by the false perceptions regarding gender and sex that my contention has always been that young men particularly either create or destroy and there's not a lot in between and I can see it with my two and a half year old boy he's a building blocks or he's knocking them down those are the only two things that he's doing at any given time and usually he's knocking them down usually he's just a suicide machine he's trying to kill himself full-time and it's my job to stop him from doing that and a society that fails to recognize that men actually have to be thrust into positions of responsibility including the responsibility to protect women shouldn't be all that surprised when it turns out that men are destructive in the absence of those responsibilities well all societies who want to thrive and survive have to spend and have spent a lot of time civilizing their young males yeah because if you don't do that they have some very unpleasant ways of making themselves noticed and if you have a lot of sort of under socialized young men they they can develop and and there is a I don't like to use the term anymore but they say toxic masculinity I'll call it protest masculinity and a young man that's in that mode will show his masculinity by destroying by tearing down by preying on vulnerable people and in fact it's just the opposite of healthy masculinity healthy man who admits a healthy masculinity they don't destroy they build they create they invent and they protect and in you know societies everywhere men have largely been the protectors and the Warriors and you know defend from attack and and they differ and there are a small number of men who are the Predators and they did they offend the society from them and we put effort into that how do you get these young men to develop a happy healthy masculinity well helps to have a father we don't hear that much about fathers in fact you often hear that denigrated in a you know oh that's just an old-fashioned idea that children need fathers well they do and we lovely boys especially it seems to take an extra toll they've looked at single-family homes and the girls overall fare better because first of all they have this heroic mother who's working so hard they pay and the boy finds his identity elsewhere so you need the father and then their ways through sports and through athletics and so forth with a coach and there are ways to focus that energy and that you know creative into healthy masculinity now overall we've done a pretty good job I mean we don't like to admit it but most people are not out committing crimes and you know it's all gone down we're doing something right but we are what we're really failing where I see we're failing most seriously is engaging young men academically and I see a lot of evidence that our schools are increasingly they favor people you know this the kids who can who are happy to be sedentary and you know talk about their feelings there's a lot of lot of writing and reading is about shared feelings and and so a kid that comes in that likes rough-and-tumble play and likes you know can't sit still and takes it there it's almost as if girls are the gold standard and boys are being measured and they're not so their first experience with school is frustration and sometimes failure much higher rates of boys getting suspended and thrown out even in preschool so people say I mean we don't as I said before we don't have these groups we don't have activist groups for boys we have a lot for women and girls and they've done good if it's done a lot of good I mean we were faltering in math and science and boy have we improved the quality of math and science education for girls where were the programs for boys who are behind in reading all the scores show I mean the boys score like slightly better in math but a girl's score higher in reading around the world you need to put extra effort into engaging a boy in the world of the written word where is that in these schools of Education where they're still teaching I don't know you know radical theories about women's oppression know they're not learning it so there's a whole field there's a lot of work to be done I tell it when I go to schools yeah there's a lot of work like male pedagogy how to teach boys and they're already starting in Australia and Canada because they're worried about their workforce they don't want to have you know 20 or 25 percent of it you know men you know in some you know who can't cope in an information economy so there we could look at what the Australians and the British are doing it but I don't know if you tried to do it they'd say that's backlash that's the patriarchy no it's not I don't want to speak that language anymore I don't think it's helpful what's helpful is to recognize one another men and women as as I said just working together and mutual civility and respect and even love this has been known to happen so I have one final question for Christina Hoff Sommers and this question is a doozy I promise we're gonna
