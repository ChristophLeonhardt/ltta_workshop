look at Zuckerberg played to his Democrat allies you know who he blames for the fact that he sells all of your secrets do you know who he blames for taking money for giving you up he blames the Russians you know I think what's clear is that in 2016 we were not as on top of a number of issues as we should have whether it was Russian interference or fake news but what we have seen since then is you know a number of months later there was a major French election and there we deployed some AI tools that did a much better job of identifying Russian BOTS and and basically Russian potential interference and weeding that out of the platform ahead of the election and we were we were much happier with how that went he really thinks we're that stupid that we'll be distracted by that well maybe maybe we will mean the Russians are the problem fake news is the problems I'm sure ones fake news which basically means opinions that the liberals don't like what does that have to do with the fact that Chuck Oberg sells your personal information to get rich what was fakeness got to do with that oh by the way the Russians didn't do it I said they didn't hack the election they didn't even hack Facebook don't take it for me take it from the VP of Facebook ads himself Rob Goldman here's what Goldman said just last month most of the coverage of Russian meddling involves their attempt to affect the outcome of the 2016 US election I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively the swaying the election was not the main goal this is the vice president of Google here yeah really as if he's saying Zuckerberg hire here's more from Goldman the majority of the Russian ad spend happened after the election we shared that fact but very few outlets have covered it because it doesn't align with the main media narrative of Trump and the election Zuckerberg Zuckerberg is a sociopath a liar he'll say or do anything he'll blame Russia because it's easier than blaming himself and there's a big payoff if people rusha it gives him the power to ban political things that he himself doesn't like watch during a special election in the Senate seat in Alabama we deployed some new AI tools that we built to detect fake accounts that were trying to spread false news and we we found a lot of different accounts coming from Macedonia so you know I think the reality here is that this isn't rocket science I mean there's a lot of hard work that we need to do to make it harder for for nation states like Russia to do election interference to make it so that trolls and other folks can't spread fake news but we can get in front of this and and we have a responsibility to do this not only for the 2018 midterms in the US which are going to be a huge deal this year and and that's a just a huge focus of us but there's a big election in India this year there's a big election in Brazil there are big elections around the world and you can bet that we are really committed to doing everything that we need to to make sure that the integrity of those elections on Facebook is is secured I know what he's talking about he shut down 30,000 Facebook accounts in France right before the election the supporter marine lepen the Conservative candidate there thirty thirty thousand accounts they were fake trust him he wouldn't lie he would he of course they were fake no trial no hearing no proof no morning no notice just him putting his finger on the delete button did you see what he did there ask him why he's selling your private data for cash to his friends like Barack Obama and he'll get really mad at the Russians right wingers and he'll censor them to punish them how is that a solution to Zuckerberg selling your data it's not there was a moment in that CNN love-in where he said he'd he'd be all for regulation given the stakes here why shouldn't Facebook be regulated um I I actually am Not sure we shouldn't be regulated you know I think in general technology is an increasing increasingly important trend in the world and I actually think the question is more what is the right regulation rather than yes or no should it be regulated well of course there is regulation of Facebook right now in Canada in American Europe around the world Facebook is subject to the law of the land like any other company like a bank it's just a matter of those laws being enforced he wants regulation but I think I know what that means it's like in Alberta when the four biggest oil sands companies said they all agreed to big regulations from Rachel Notley a carbon tax and a maximum production cap on the all cents well of course they did because they were able to get in to the deal and navigate their way through the regulatory system they hire a dozen top-notch lobbyists and they'd make sure they made out just fine in the regulations just like those for oil sands companies managed to get subsidies to cover their carbon tax cost but what they really wanted to do is regulate out of existence and he would be competitors in Alberta the four oil sands companies got a cap on total oil sands production which basically means a ban on new competitors the existing guys are fine that's what Facebook wants they want to be regulated in a form that Zuckerberg would suggest that they'd find a way to keep their monopoly to work with the new rules and use any regulations to smash and he would be upstarts so what's the answer here I think Trump really should look at a trust-busting approach to these Facebook monopolies I know it's not the libertarian answer but Facebook literally has more than 2 billion users and there has never in history being a monopoly like it and Zuckerberg is clearly a lying robber baron I think that's a real thing to consider but also don't let him weasel and Lobby his way through this with his friends in Congress I think he should be sued in a massive class action suit by the 50 million people who allegedly had their Terms of Service violated where are the mass tort lawyers in the US where are all those litigators of fortune those pirates surely this is the biggest richest target yet more than any tobacco company more than any pharmaceutical company sue Mark Zuckerberg sue that serial liar get the facts through the disclosure process lawsuit who got the data who broke the laws who knew who approved who got rich off it
