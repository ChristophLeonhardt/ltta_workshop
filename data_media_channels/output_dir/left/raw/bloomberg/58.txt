1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:03,980
Masayoshi Son is one of the most influential
dealmakers of our time.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,880
“This is Masa of Softbank from Japan.”

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,480
Son, who goes by Masa, is considered by some
as one of the most brilliant risk takers in

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,950
venture capital.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,789
$32 billion for chipmaker ARM, $9 billion
to Uber, $4.4 billion into WeWork.

6
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,360
The list goes on.

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,620
Others think the chief executive of Softbank
is a wreckless daredevil with a spotty track record.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,640
After the dotcom crash he lost more money
than anyone has ever lost in history.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,280
$70 billion.

10
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,170
“We almost went bankrupt.

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,620
Somehow I survived.”

12
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:46,530
But love him or hate him, he’s shaking up
Silicon Valley and global investing.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,220
Has Masa just been lucky, or is he actually
a genius when it comes to investing in the

14
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,760
future of technology?

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,500
So is he a genius investor?

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,040
I think the jury is still out but one thing you cannot

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,030
deny Son is that he certainly seems to have
foresight.

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,820
Bloomberg tech reporter Pavel Alpeyev has
been covering Masa and Softbank for the last decade.

19
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,960
One famous example is… a few years prior
to Apple’s launch of the iphone, Son was

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,680
visiting with Steve Jobs in California and
offered him sketches of a prototype device

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,790
that combined the functionality of the ipod
and a mobile phone.

22
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,530
Knowing Apple was developing the iphone, Jobs
refused.

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,490
So Masa got him to agree to exclusive rights
for their product in Japan, bringing Softbank,

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,799
and Masa, a lot of success.

25
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,610
This wasn’t his first big business deal
however.

26
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,159
While attending the University of California
at Berkeley he invented a digital translator

27
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,170
and sold it to Sharp for 100 million yen or
about $1 million.

28
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:56,390
Using that money, he founded Softbank which
is a household name in Japan that aires popular

29
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,800
commercials with Tommy Lee Jones and a dog.

30
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,899
For a brief period during the dot-com bubble,
Masa was the world’s richest man ...before

31
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,620
99% of his deals failed.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,860
At the center of his reputation is one very
important transaction -- In 2000 he made a

33
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,640
$20 million investment in an unknown Chinese
startup called Alibaba...

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,349
And a young founder named Jack Ma.

35
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:36,720
"I could tell from the way he talks that he
has charisma, has leadership.”

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,170
Softbank’s stake in Alibaba is now worth
$138 billion -- one of the most lucrative

37
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,239
venture investments of all time.

38
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,150
One could potentially be lucky.

39
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,950
So if you assume that a track record of one
is just lucky, then it certainly casts doubt

40
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,480
on Son's ability to pick winners.

41
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,830
Nowadays, Masa is aggressively making investments…
on a massive scale… in tech.

42
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:11,660
He invested in 100-or-so startups in 2017,
including two of the most valuable-- Uber

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,019
and Didi.

44
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,739
With both, he used a similar maneuver to close
the deal.

45
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:22,520
Son went publicly on record saying that the
company was considering investing in Uber

46
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:29,000
or Lyft… you know a not so subtle hint at
‘take the money or we’ll find someone

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,319
else who will.

48
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,060
Masa has a distinct deal-making style.

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,370
He’s known to invite founders to Tokyo for
a formal meeting, followed by a meal… and

50
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,159
then offers them a massive amount of money.

51
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,900
The picture that we get is that when Son comes
into the room, at this point, his business

52
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,659
people know your company through and through,
and he's there to make an offer.

53
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:56,000
Although he doesn’t acquire controlling
stakes in any of the companies and is generally

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
hands-off…

55
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,230
Softbank’s money still comes with comes
with one important condition...

56
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,610
Like he told San Diego based robot company
Brain Corp… basically he wants them to reach

57
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:09,830
their goals at an accelerated rate.

58
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,140
As Masa pours money into one startup after
another...

59
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,600
He has also been lining up some generous backers
for Softbanks’s $100 Billion Vision Fund

60
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,140
-- the largest investment fund in history
to finance technology startups.

61
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:31,360
He got pledges from Apple’S Tim Cook, Qualcomm,
Foxconn and 1 unexpected place: the Middle East.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,640
What’s interesting is the main backer of
the fund is the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,460
who contributed $45 billion.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,640
“45 minutes $45 billion...

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,380
One billion dollars per minute”.

66
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,010
Not all investors are on board with his vision.

67
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:52,130
They point to SoftBank’s stock in Alibaba
and other assets, which are worth more than

68
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:59,020
19 trillion yen but SoftBank’s market cap
is only 9.8 trillion yen.

69
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,820
That's just evidence that a lot of investors
are not buying Son's future.

70
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:09,540
Critics not only don't believe Son can pick
the next Alibaba; they're convinced he's going

71
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,040
to squander what he already has.

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,970
Whether a believer or not in Masa’s strategy…

73
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:19,990
The investments he’s making now are not
like those he made during the 90s dotcom bubble.

74
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,990
They are companies which have already proven
that they can survive.

75
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,970
In the end whether Son deserves to be
called a genius investor rather just one with

76
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:37,090
very deep pockets, will probably depend on
his ability to not just deliver a decent return,

77
00:05:37,090 --> 00:00:00,000
but also the kind of societal impact that
he aspires to.
