my one Bashara is here Marvin we actually heard an as live or sort of just um you know that press conference almost between the two leaders where Trump mentioned all these business deals what struck at you not just about the business deals but the other things the two leaders discussed it seemed to me like like a bizarre arms bazaar of sort you know what the graphics and everything and and and the the angles were really wrong you know with the vice president almost like he's holding the signs and then the signs being pasted on the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia as if it's some sort of you know a horse bazaar of some sort the optics were definitely not not great but I think the president was trying to sell not only arms to Saudi Arabia he was trying to sell Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince to the American public so I think the whole circus was meant in order to sell and improve the image of the conference of the new Saudi Arabia to the American public because as we spoke earlier everyone knows that in terms of image the Saudi Arabia suffers from that in the answers and I mean not just image the United Nations for example blames airstrikes by the saudi-led coalition for the majority of civilian deaths in in Yemen award that's now gone on for a long time do you think I mean is it speculation is there any hope the president Trump will put any kind of pressure on Saudi Arabia to wrap up the war in Yemen one way or another we haven't seen any of that certainly not visible to us the only thing that we've seen was several months ago defense minister mattis didn't say that we need to conclude this conflict in Yemen through diplomacy and some sort of a peace process but sending arms to Saudi Arabia unconditionally and not even mentioning the war in Yemen in this press conference or in this whatever we call it I think that's a scandal to the United States because even the most hypocritical of the American administrations have always attached some sort of legal framework two selling arms to Saudi Arabia and other countries now let's all remember that under the Obama administration the the the United States the United States sold Saudi Arabia a hundred and fifteen billion dollars worth of arms so although there were tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United States at the time still one hundred and fifteen billion dollars of arms did that bring any security of Saudi Arabia did that not bring more and more destruction to Yemen what but what we're seeing now is basically doubling down on that and committing to sell Saudi Arabia a hundred and ten billion additional dollars of arms while the war in Yemen is killing countless people it's interesting you mentioned the defense secretary mattis because actually he is one of the people that mom had been someone is due to meet over the next two days so I'm interesting to see if anything comes out of that man one Bashara thank you
