hi guys in the big pink
apologize
no no when we don't know who picked him
up or where he's going yeah but we're
done with him you should be in prison
right now but he's not in our custody
the law has to be that if you rape
someone who is unconscious and
intoxicated you go to state prison and
that builds on the governor's desk right
now and we're urging the governor to
sign it I think it's great walk with how
when you apologize
