I absolutely let my dog with my face I think it's gross I don't know I think it's how she expresses her love I'm fine with it I've never heard of anyone getting a disease from their dog so I just think it's gross and if maybe they ate poop or something and they're always in the dirt dog licks some people love them some people hate them but are they safe dogs lick for a variety of reasons it's one of the ways dogs communicate with one another dogs are very scent oriented their owners may have a certain scent or taste that is familiar which is very calming for them they also like to get attention for healthy people contact with dog saliva on human skin is extremely unlikely to cause problems there is very little absorption through the skin however dogs saliva and pathogens are more easily absorbed by mucous membranes in the nose mouth and eyes which could lead to infection there are many types of bacteria in a dog's mouth some of which is ZOA notic ZOA nautic bacteria is bacteria that animals can pass to humans and cause disease common zoonotic bacteria are Clostridium coli salmonella and campylobacter which tend to cause severe gastrointestinal disease in humans a person can come in contact so anodic bacteria in two ways when a dog licks the person's nose mouth or eyes or if a dog licks a person and this individual does not wash his or her hands before touching the nose mouth or eyes this is known as the fecal-oral route the parasite is excreted in the feces of the animal and the person unknowingly has oral contact with the fecal matter to prevent infection from your dog you should wash your hands after touching your pet avoid being licked on the face and keep your pet in a clean well-maintained environment also make sure your dog is under the care of a veterinarian who can prescribe appropriate parasite prevention treatment people with compromised or underdeveloped immune systems should take greater care to avoid their dog's mouth because there is a higher likelihood of developing infection or contracting disease from dog licks and as far as saying that a dog's mouth is cleaner than a human's mouth depending on what dogs are licking the bacterial component of their saliva will change the next time your dog tries to lick your face think about where its mouth has been
