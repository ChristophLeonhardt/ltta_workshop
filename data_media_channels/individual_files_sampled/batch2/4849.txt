turning now to the situation in syria and ambassador nikki Haley yesterday warning that the u.s. quote remains prepared to act if we must if the international community does not do more regarding the Assad regime's continuous assault on the city of eastern Goethe at least a hundred or I should say eleven hundred and forty people have died in the last 22 days in eastern gluta including 402 women and children per the british-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights joining us now is Rania Abouzeid she's a journalist and author of the new book no turning back life loss and hope in wartime Syria that is out today Rania great to have you with us here on set there's so many different nations that are now involved in this conflict in Syria and sometimes for us here in the West it's hard to understand or wrap our head around it you spend so much time on the ground recording there from inside the country how did this become such a global proxy war because of Syria's geopolitical position it was alike to Iran and to Russia and the Syrian opposition the one side you have Iran and Russia and Lebanese Hezbollah backing at the Assad regime and then you have the Gulf states at E Arabia Qatar Turkey on the other side with the backing of the US and Europe so it's a proxy war and it's a battlefield for so many different nations you I want to talk a little bit about your book you tracked four different individuals over six years you're actually there for the very first protest in Syria not necessarily knowing what it was going to become thinking that any day that Bashar al-assad was going to step down yeah and here we are many years later and he is still there how do you feel like this this war the civil war has changed those individuals that you were following specifically what did you see in them their journey is honestly I mean one of the reasons why I wrote this book is because I had a movie playing in my head and the movie was full of characters like this and honestly I don't think that Hollywood could have scripted some of the the storylines in terms of what happened to some of these people their epic epic journeys over six or seven years let me ask you about one of the major solutions to this conflict that a lot of people always bounce around as an ideas like that President Assad has to step down from power it seems like that is unlikely to happen right now but that the critics that the only way solution can emerge in this conflict I mean why would he negotiate his own demise right why would he leave and especially when he's he's making gains on the battlefield his allies the Iranians and the Russians are still backing him and he's effectively winning on the ground so why would he step down and so you feel like he still has the upper hand there's no reason for him to go anywhere no no advantage let me ask you really quickly out of all the characters that you followed over the course of those years which one stood out the most to you I mean I know that's a hard question I mean every one of them was there a theme among all four of them that you noticed there no I mean every one of them is it has a different trajectory so you follow a kind of fighters you follow Free Syrian Army fighters you follow a little girl in her family and you follow a civil activist and and their paths at times intersect even if they didn't know it and but they illustrate different elements of what happened in Syria over the past six years well and where are some of these people now where is this little girl that you followed for so long and I know that you followed you said an Islamic extremist as well yes several yeah so where are they now they're all in different places some of them are still in Syria and some of them are in Europe some of them are in neighboring states and some of them are dead you and you talk about this little girl that you were following and how she was such a young girl and yet she sort of had this adult way about her because of what she was experiencing in her life yeah why did you think she had that what did you see in her she was very precocious and she was very aware of other things that were happening around her and she tried to understand them like a little girl so she would sit in them in the basement of their their home when the planes were overhead and she'd make paper planes pretending to shoot down the real ones that were above so that was her way of sort of coping with with what she was seeing and her way of maybe having a little bit of control to think that I I'm making a plane and that this is you know so she would do things like that yeah absolutely hard for so many children affected by the civil how they have been effective not wait alright Runyan was that
