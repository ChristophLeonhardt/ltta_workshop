>> Announcer: THIS SAN ABC'S 
NEWS SPECIAL REPORT.
THAILAND RESCUE, RACE AGAINST 
TIME.
>> HELLO FROM NEW YORK, I'M DAN 
HARRIS ALONGSIDE PAULA FERRIS.
AND WE ARE COMING ON THE AIR 
WITH SOME GREAT NEWS ABOUT THE 
RESCUE OPERATION TO SAVE MEMBERS
OF THAT YOUNG SOCCER TEAM AND 
THEIR COACH TRAPPED IN A CAVE IN
THAILAND FOR MORE THAN TWO 
WEEKS. 
>> AND THAT WAS THE SCENE JUST 
OUTSIDE THE CAVE WHERE IT'S 
ALREADY SUNDAY NIGHT AS FOUR OF 
THE PLAYERS WERE BROUGHT TO 
SAFETY JUST A FEW HOURS AGO IN 
WHAT'S BEEN A COMPLICATED AND 
RISKY OPERATION.
>> THEY WERE TAKEN TO THE 
HOSPITAL BY AMBULANCE AND MY 
HELICOPTER.
THEY'RE NOW BEING EVALUATED AND 
TREATED. 
>> THE BOYS FLANGE AGES 11 TO 16
WERE EXTRACT THE AT A PACE MUCH 
FASTER THAN EXPECTED. 
>> IT'S AN INCREDIBLE 
DEVELOPMENT.
DIVERS HAD BEEN STANDING FWOI 
MAKE THIS RESCUE.
THEY STARTED THE OPERATION 
OVERNIGHT.
THEY STARTED BRINGING THE FIRST 
BOYS OUT LATE LAST NIGHT 
THAILAND TIME WHICH WAS EARLY 
THIS MORNING HEREE U.S. TIME.
THEY CAME, THOSE BOYS FROM 
NEARLY THREE MILES DEEP INSIDE 
THAT CAVE. 
>> AND WE WANT TO SHOW YOU A 
VIRTUAL VIEW OF THE TRESH CHORUS
ROUTE THAT THE DIVERS TOOK THEM 
THROUGH IN AN OPERATION THAT 
WILL CONTINUE IN THE HOURS TO 
COME.
FOUR HAVE BEEN RUDE, EIGHT 
REMAIN ALONG WITH THEIR SOCCER 
COACH. 
>> LET'S GO TO MATT ON THE SCENE
IN THAILAND.
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING NOW, MATT?
>> Reporter: IT WAS A STUPENDOUS
DAY FOR THESE PEOPLE, DAN AND 
PAULA.
WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS 
TRYING TO REGROUP.
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO SEE SOME 
TRAFFIC BEHIND ME.
THEY'RE SENDING MORE OXYGEN 
TANKS BACK INTO THAT CAVE AREA.
THEY'VE GOT TO REPLENISH THE 
SUPPLIES.
THEY'RE ALSO PUMPING ADDITIONAL 
OXYGEN IN THERE.
THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT THE 
OXYGEN LEVELS HAVE DIPPED.
WE DON'T EXPECT THEM TO BEGIN 
EXTRACTING ADDITIONAL BOYS, 
THOSE EIGHT BOYS LEFT PLUS THE 
COACH PROBABLY FOR ANOTHER SIX 
OR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS.
NOT UNTIL MORNING.
THEY'RE GOING TO REGROUP AND TRY
TO GO AT THIS AGAIN.
THE WAY THEY DID IT AS YOU 
DESCRIBED IS COMPLEX.
IT'S THIS CHORE GRAEFD DANCE.
EACH ONE OF THE BOYS HAD TWO 
DIVERS WITH THEM.
THEY WERE CONVEYED ALONG THIS 
SERPENTINE ROUTE YOUND GROUND, 
SOME OF IT UNDERWATER FOR MILES.
THEY STAUD AT CERTAIN CHAMBERS 
WHERE THERE WAS MUCH MORE AIR TO
REGROUP AND ASETS BOY'S HEALTH 
AND THEY MOVED ON.
THE FIRST ONE CAME OUT AT ABOUT 
5:40 P.M. LOCAL TIME, THE NEXT 
ONE ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER.
THEN AN HOUR AND A HALF OR SO 
LATER THE OTHER BOYS CAME OUT 
SEPARATED BY ABOUT TEN MINUTES.
I CAN TELL YOU AT THIS 
INTERSECTION WHERE WE'VE SEEN SO
MUCH ACTIVITY, THERE'S A LINE OF
SOLDIERS HERE WHO SALUTED THE 
RESCUE WORKERS HAD THEY CAME 
OUT.
IT WAS AN AMAZING MOMENT.
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY TORT,  
YOU'RE RUSS AND DIFFERENT THING 
TO DO.
NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL 
HOURS ON END, BUT THE CEILING 
HAS JAGGED COURSE ROCK, THEY 
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE WATER AND 
THE POSSIBLE FEAR OF THESE BOYS 
PANICKING WHILE THEY HAVE THESE 
FULL FACE MASKS ON THEIR FACE.
BUT IT SEEMS THAT EVERYBODY DID 
SPLENDIDLY WELL AND OBVIOUSLY 
THOSE BOYS ARE NOW RECOVERING AT
A HOSPITAL LIKELY SUFFERING FROM
SOME SORT OF EXHAUSTION OR 
SOMETHING, BUT CLEARLY A VERY 
DIFFICULT ORDEAL FOR THEM. 
>> SO FAR IT HAS BEEN A BEST 
CASE SCENARIO BUT THEY NOR THE 
OUT OF THE WOODS YET HAD THE GO 
OVER TO JAMES LONGMAN WHO'S ALSO
ON THE GROUND.
JAMES, THIS CONTINUES TO BE A 
RACE AGAINST TIME.
WE KNOW THEY'VE TAKE INA LITTLE 
BIT OF TIME OFF.
EIGHT BOYS REMAYBE IN THE CAVE 
AS WELL AS THEIR COACH AND IT 
LOOKS LIKE THE RAINS ARE COMING.
>> Reporter: YEAH, THAT'S BEEN 
THE WHOLE ISSUE FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING, PAULA.
TO BEAT THE RAIN.
AND THE WHOLE ISSUE IS THE WATER
LEVEL IN THAT CAVE.
FROM THE VERY START AT LEAST 
WHEN WE KNEW THAT THESE BOYS 
WERE IN THE CAVE, BECAUSE 
REMEMBER TO BEGIN WITH FOR THE 
FIRST FEW DAYS OF THIS THEY WERE
LOST AND THERE WAS NO SIGN OF 
THEM.
BUT THE RESCUERS DISCOVERED THEY
WERE THERE, THERE WAS REAL 
JUBILATION IN THE CAMP WHICH 
EVERYONE WAS BASED AND THEN THE 
REELEDZA
REALIZATION THAT THEY HAD TO BE 
GOTTEN OUT.
AND THEN THEY TRIED TO BRING 
DOWN THE WATER FOR THE PAST FEW 
DAYS AND EVEN THOUGH THE CAMP 
WAS DRY IT SEEMED THEY WERE NOT 
ABLE TO BRING IT DOWN AS MUCH AS
THEY WOULD LIKE.
WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY ONE OR TWO 
CENTIMETERS A DAY.
THEY HAD SOMETHING LIKE 60 
PUMPS, THEY HAD ONE PUMP THAT 
HAD SOMETHING LIKE 400 
HORSEPOWER WORKING AROUND THE 
CLOCK.
THEY PUT DALMS IN TO TRY TO GET 
THE WATER DIVERTED FROM THE 
CAVE.
IT SEEMS THAT WATER WAS BROUGHT 
OUT FROM SOME OF THE MORE 
DIFFICULT PORTIONS OF THE CAVE 
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY GOT 
RID OF SOME OF THE ROCK WHICH 
WAS PREVENTING THE BOYS FROM 
BEING ABLE TO COME OUT WITHOUT 
HAVING TO DIP THEIR HEAD INTO 
THE WATER.
THE RESCUERS SAID THEY DID NOT 
WANT THEM TO HAVE TO FULLY 
SUBMERGE THEMSELVES FOR EXTENDED
PERIODS OF TIME, THEY WANTED TO 
BRING THEM ALONG THE TOP THE 
WATER.
THEY USED THESE UNDERWATER JACK 
HAMMERS TO BREAK DOWN THE ROCK.
NOW THE RAIN HAS RETURNED AND 
IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT THAT'S GOING 
TO DO TO THE SITUATION INSIDE 
THE CAVE.
IF THEY'VE BUILT ENOUGH DAMS TO 
MAKE SURE THIS RAIN WON'T MAKE A
DIFFERENCE.
BUT THESE CAVES SIT UNDER AN 
ENORMOUS MOUNTAIN RANGE.
IT IS BASICALLY A NATURAL 
DRAINAGE SYSTEM FOR A JUNGLE AND
ALL THAT WATER IS SEEPING DOWN 
INTO WHAT IS A LIMESTONE CAVE 
AND WATER COMES IN FROM ALL OVER
THE PLACE, IT SEEPS INSIDE.
TONIGHT I THINK THERE WILL BE 
PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN 
THAT THIS RAIN COULD MAKE A 
DIFFERENCE.
HOPEFULLY IT ISN'T STRONG ENOUGH
TO REALLY DELAY THE RESCUE 
OPERATION.
BUT RESCUERS HAVE BEEN SAYING 
AND AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING 
THEY'RE FULLY COMMITTED TO 
GETTING THE REST OF THESE BOYS 
OUT.
THIS, IF ANYTHING, IS JUST GOING
TO PUSH THEM DO IT MORE QUICK. 
>> I IT'S A GREAT DAY BUT 
UNDERLYING YOUR POINT, THERE'S 
STILL A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE, 
REASON FOR SKERN.
NINE FAMILIES WORRIED ABOUT 
THEIR CHILDREN AND ALSO THE 
FAMILY, OF COURSE, OF THE COACH,
THE 25-YEAR-OLD COACH WHO LED 
THEM INTO THAT CAVE AND HAS 
SUBSEQUENTLY APOLOGIZED FOR IF 
THE BUT ONE REASON FOR HOPE IS 
THEY BEGAN THEY TOLD US WITH THE
FOUR WEAKEST BOYS.
THEY WANTED TO GET THEM OUT 
FIRST.
THE FACT THEY WERE ABLE TO TAKE 
THE WEAKEST BOYS AND MOVE AHEAD 
OF SCHEDULE, THAT HAS TO BE A 
SOURCE OF OPTIMISM.
AND I WONDER IF WE CAN GET YOU 
TO TALK A LITTLE BIT, JAMES, 
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ON THE SCENE 
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS 
STORY ABOUT HOW THE MOOD HAS 
SHIFTED OVER THESE -- IN VARIOUS
WAYS OVER THE PAST TWO WEEKS. 
>> DAN, IT'S BEEN A REAL RIDE.
YOU KNOW, WE ARRIVED HERE VERY 
EARLY ON TO A STORY TWLO WHERE 
MOST OF THE INTERNATIONAL TYPES 
LIKE US COULD THEY FIND THESE 
BOYS IN THIS ENORMOUS CAVE?
WE'RE TOLD HOW BIG IT IS HERE IN
NORTHERN THAILAND INTO MYANMAR, 
ANOTHER COUNTRY.
THIS CAVE SYSTEM IS ENORMOUS.
THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD EVEN 
FIND THEM AT THE VERY BEGINNING 
WAS KIND OF LUDICROUS.
BUT LOW AND BEHOLD, THEY DID AND
THEY EVEN FOUND THEM FURTHER 
INSIDE THE CAVE THAN THEY HAD 
ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED.
SO THAT WAS GREAT EUPHORIA.
BUT THEN DID DAWN ON EVERYONE IN
THE CAMP HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS 
GOING TO BE 0 TO GET THEM OUT.
THERE WAS A REALLY STRONG 
CURRENT.
WE AWE IMAGES OF RESCUE DIVERS 
PULLING THEMSELVES HAND OVER 
FIST ALONG ROPES TO TRY TO GET 
THEMSELVES UP THAT CAVE, FIVE, 
SIX HOURS OF DIVING FOR VERY 
FIT, STRONG NAVY SEALS.
AND THEN OF COURSE A FEW DAYS 
AGO THE SAD DEATH OF ONE OF 
THOSE FORMER THAI NAVY SEAL 
RESCUE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD SPENT 
HIS TIME DELIVERING OXYGEN TANKS
AND AIR TANKS INTO THAT CAVE TO 
ALLOW PEOPLE TO GET FURTHER 
DOWN, HE ENDED UP DYING OF A 
LACK OF AX AGAIN.
SO I THINK AT THAT POINT, THAT 
WAS PROBABLY THE LOWEST IT'S 
BEEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS
WHOLE SITUATION.
IT'S A REMINDER REALLY OF HOW 
DIFFICULT THIS WHOLE PROCESS HAS
BEEN, HIS DEATH, AND, YES, AS 
YOU SAY, A REAL RIDE.
BUT HOPEFULLY WE'RE SEEING THE 
END OF IT.
BUT, AGAIN, THIS RAIN, I THINK 
THIS IS REALLY A WORRY NOW. 
>> JUST THE RANGE OF EMOTIONS 
THAT SO MANY HAVE ENDURED AND 
THEY HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK, 
JAMES, TO PUMP MORE OXYGEN INTO 
THE CAVES AND THEN THEY WILL 
RESUME AND TRY EXTRACT THE 
REMAIN BEING EIGHT BOYS AND THE 
SOCCER COACH.
BUT I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT 
THOSE FAMILIES, JAMES, THANK 
YOU.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THOSE 
FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT
NOW.
WE WANT TO JOIN ADRIAN BANK ARD 
WHO'S JUST OUTSIDE ONE OF THE 
LOCAL HOSPITALS.
FOUR BOYS ARE AT THE HOSPITAL.
ADRIENNE, WHAT KIND OF TREATMENT
WILL THEY UNDERGO ONCE THEY'RE 
AT THE HOSPITAL?
>> Reporter: WELL, THE FOUR BOYS
WHO ARE HERE ON SCENE, WE KNOW 
THEY'RE ON THAT EIGHTH FLOOR 
THAT WE WERE TOLD BY OFFICIALS 
HAS BEEN RESERVED FOR ALL 13 WHO
ARE COMING OUT OF THAT CAVE.
THEY WILL BE REUNITED WITH 
FAMILY.
ONES HERE WE SUSPECT ALREADY AND
THEIR MOTHERS AND FATHERS AND 
ANTES AND UNCLE'S ARMS.
WE DO KNOW THEY'LL BE UNDERGOING
COMPLETE MEDICAL EVALUATIONS 
BESIDES WHAT WAS DONE ALREADY 
FOR THEM IN THE STAGING AREA 
INSIDE THAT CAVE.
I MEAN, ALL ALONG THE WAY 
THEY'VE HAD DOCTORS AND NURSES 
AND PARAMEDICS ALONG SIDE OF 
THEM.
WE SAW FROM WHAT OFFICIALS HAVE 
TOLD US THAT THEY HAD A FIELD 
HOSPITAL THERE AT THE CAVE SITE.
JAMES AND MATT HAVE BEEN REPORT 
THOONG.
AND THEN THEY WERE TRANSPORTED 
TO AN AMBULANCE WHICH TOOK THEM 
TO THE HELICOPTER WHICH TOOK 
THEM TO ANOTHER AMBULANCE WHICH 
BROUGHT THEM RIGHT HERE TO THIS 
HOSPITAL'S DOORSTEP.
NOW WE DO KNOW THAT THEY'LL BE 
CHECKED FOR INFECTIONS.
THERE IS A CAVE DISEASE, AS IT'S
CALLED REASON, AN AIRBORNE LUNG 
INFECTION THAT'S OF CONCERN JUST
FROM THEM BEING INSIDE THE CAVE 
AND THOSE CONDITIONS THERE, THE 
DAMPNESS OF THE CAVE, BEING 
AROUND WATER SO LONG AND BEING 
IN THE WATER.
THEY MAY NEED TO BE TREATED FOR 
ANY TYPE OF BACTERIAL INFECTION 
AS A RESULT OF THAT.
AND BEING IN THE DARK THAT LONG,
BEING AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES 
AND FRIENDS, BEING AWAY FROM A 
NORMAL ROUTINE OR EXERCISE, I 
MEAN, THESE ARE YOUNG SOCCER 
PLAYERS AGES 11 TO 16.
IMAGINE THE ENERGY THAT YOUR SON
OR ANY OF FEW OR COUSIN HAS AND 
THAT THEY'RE TRAPPED INSIDE THIS
VERY ENCLOSED SPACE FOR TWO 
WEEKS SEPARATE.
IT WAS ALREADY MENTIONED THAT 
THIS COACH REALLY HAS BEEN 
ADDING TO THE COMRADERY AND THE 
HOPEFULNESS OF THE TEAM KEEPING 
THESE YOUNG BOYS ALIVE AND 
ALERT.
BUT THEY WILL BE TREATED IF ANY 
OF THEM HAVE POST TRAUMATIC 
STRESS DISORDER, WHICH DOCTORS 
HAVE TOLD US IS CERTAINLY 
POSSIBLE WHERE THEY'LL HAVE 
NIGHTMARES OR BE CONCERNED ABOUT
BEING IN CLOSED SPACES OR 
FEARFUL OF THE DARK.
BUT, AGAIN, THEY'LL BE ALL 
TREATED HERE ON THAT EIGHTH 
FLOOR AND REUNITED WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES.
AND THAT SAY GOOD THING.
PAULA AND DAN. 
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BUT WE CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH, 
THERE ARE EIGHT MORE CHILDREN IN
THERE YET TO BE RESCUED ALONG 
WITH THEIR COACH ABOUT THE 
ADRIENNE OUTSIDE THE HOTEL.
WE APPRECIATE IT.
THIS IMAGE REALLY UNDERSCORES 
THE.IENCY AND THE TEAM NATURE OF
THIS RESCUE EFFORT.
IT'S A PICTURE PUT OUT ON 
FACEBOOK BY THE ROYAL THAI NAVY 
SEALS WITH THE CAPTION WE, BOTH 
THE THAI AND INTERNATIONAL 
TEAMS, WILL BRING OUT THE WILD 
BOAR TEAM, THE TEAM, THE SOCCER 
TEAM, THEY'RE THE WILD BOARS, 
WILL BRING THEM BACK HOME, HOO 
YA, THE WILD BOORS BOARS, EIGHT 
OF THEM STILL IN THAT CAVE.
13 2014 FOREIGNERS, FIVE THAI 
NAVY SEALS.
LET'S GO BACK TO MATT TO TALK A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT A TEAM 
EFFORT THIS IS, WHAT AN 
INTERNATIONAL EFFORT THIS IS.
>> Reporter: YOU KNOW, WE FOCUS 
ON THE DIVERS A LOT AND WE TALK 
ABOUT THOSE 13 DIVERS WHO 
PHYSICALLY ESCORTED OR 13 
FOREIGNERS WHO PHYSICALLY 
ESCORTED THOSE BOYS OUT OF THE 
CAVE OR AT LEAST THE FIRST FOUR 
ABOUT THE BUT REALLY THIS HAS 
BEEN A MASSIVE HERCULEAN EFFORT 
SBOI MANY OTHERS.
THERE WERE 90 TOTAL DIVERS 
INVOLVED IN TODAY'S RESCUE 
ALONE.
50 OF THEM FOREIGNERS.
THAT'S A LARGE NUMBER.
BUT ALSO WE'VE HAD PEOPLE FROM 
ALL OVER THE WORLD JUST 
PHYSICALLY HAUL GAS TANKS, AIR 
TANKS ALL THE WAY INTO THE CAVE.
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LAID 
ROPE ACROSS.
THERE ARE COMMUNICATIONS SET UP 
FROM PLACES LIKE ISRAEL.
THERE ARE DIVERS FROM FINLAND 
AND BELGIUM AND HOLLAND AND 
ENGLAND AND THE UNITED STATES.
SO IT IS REALLY TRULY BEEN AN 
INTERNATIONAL EFFORT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE 
TO COMMEND THE THAI AUTHORITIES 
FOR, THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ASHAMED 
ABOUT ASKING FOR HELP.
THEY HAVE TAKEN EVERYBODY IN, 
THEY VIN HAVE INVITED US IN.
THE ATMOSPHERE HERE HAS JUST 
BEEN INCREDIBLE, SO 
PARTICIPATORY AND ACCEPTING THAT
THEY HAVE REALLY -- OBVIOUSLY 
IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 
WORK FOR THEM BUT THEY HAVE FELT
LIKE THEY ARE PART OF THIS THAI 
FAMILY AND JUST TO BE ABLE TO 
CAP IT OFF AT LEAST WITH THOSE 
FIRST FOUR RESCUES HAS BEEN 
TREMENDOUS FOR SO MANY OF THOSE 
INVOLVED HERE. 
>> THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY 
IS CERTAINLY REJOICING.
THIS HAS BEEN AN INSPIRING AND 
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.
BUT, MATT, IT'S DARKY YOU ARE.
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT IN THAILAND
AND THAI OFFICIALS SAID THAT 
THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK, 
ABOUT A TEN TO 20-HOUR BREAK 
FROM EXTRACTING THE REMAINING 
BOYS AND THEIR SOCCER COACH.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO EVERYONE AT 
HOME WHY THAT'S NECESSARY?
>> Reporter: I THINK BECAUSE 
THEY HAD SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED
IN THIS RESCUE, IT LITERALLY WAS
THE FINAL PUSH.
THEY THREW EVERYTHING AT THIS 
THEY HAD.
BUT THEY ALSO EXPENDED A 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES.
SO AS JAMES MENTIONED, THERE ARE
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF PUMPS PUSHING
WATER OUT, MILLIONS OF GALLONS 
AT A TIME.
THERE ARE DIVERS WHO ARE SPENT.
THEY'RE TIRED, AND THEY HAVE 
LITERALLY POSTED HUNDREDS OF AIR
TANKS ALONG THE ROUTE FOR THE 
DIVERS AND THEIR TEAMS AROUND 
THEM, MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE PEOPLE 
TO USE AS THEY GO THROUGH.
AND ONE DIVER DESCRIBED IT TO ME
AS LIKE CLIMBING MOUNT EVEREST.
IT'S SO PHYSICALLY EXPERTING.
TODAY WE SPENT AN OUR IN A CAVE 
THAT WAS EXEMPLAR TO IT MINUS 
THE WATER.
WITHIN FIVE MINUTES I WAS 
HUFFING AND PUFFING.
SO THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AIR AT 
A TREMENDOUS PACE.
THEY'VE GOT TO BUILD BACK THEIR 
STOCKPILE OF THOSE AIR TANKS.
THEY'RE PUMPING IN GAS AS WELL, 
OXYGEN, TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE OTHER BOYS AND THEIR COACH 
ARE READY FOR THIS JOURNEY AND 
THEY PROBABLY WANT TO DO IT 
WITHOUT THE RAIN AND WITHOUT ALL
THIS MUD AND THE DARKNESS.
SO EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN 
SUPPORT ROLES OUTSIDE THE CAVE 
DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER THROUGH 
THESE CONDITIONS AS WELL.
SO THE KEY GOAL RIGHT NOW WAS 
NOT ONLY TO GET THE BOYS OUT, 
BUT TO GET THEM OUT SAFELY.
THERE ARE SO MANY PIT FALLS IN 
THAT CAVE AND I THINK AFTER 
TODAY'S SUCCESS THEY WANT TO 
TAKE IT SLOWLY.
BUT FROM THE START THEY TOLD US 
THIS KWO TAKECOULD TAKE THREE T 
DAYS.
THEY'RE HOPING IT DOESN'T BUT 
THEY'RE WILLING TO TAKE THAT 
TIME IF THEY FEEL LIKE THEY 
NEED. 
>> IT'S A HERCULEAN TASK AND THE
COOPERATION REALLY THE BEST OF 
HUMANITY ON DISPLAY HERE.
THANKS TO YOU AND THE REST OF 
THE TEAM COVERING THIS STORY IN 
CHIANG RAI.
WE WANT TO PROMISE YOU HERE ON 
ABC'S NEWS WE STAY ON THIS BREAK
STORY BOTH ON ABC'S
