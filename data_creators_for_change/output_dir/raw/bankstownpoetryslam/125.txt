<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's fine sorry this is the story</font>

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,609
of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> elderly male patient and it's</font>

00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,950
hair white as snow<font color="#E5E5E5"> callous knuckles on</font>

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,340

heartstrings tighter feelings and kiss

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,680
quick and heartbeats mischievous

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,510
planning's and unforeseen miss

13
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,250
happenings gold-plated<font color="#E5E5E5"> memories lost on</font>

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,559
the winds of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past time she travels</font>

15
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,299
fast broken with lines is my aging face

16
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,770
and in my tormented mind there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font>

17
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,140
grace in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moments when I can't</font>

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember my own son's name my address my</font>

home or my<font color="#CCCCCC"> favorite place cortical</font>

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,150
atrophy that's why they laugh at me

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">unable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to feed dress or walk I barely do</font>

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,060
anything at all but some days some days

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,869
she comes to me that mistress called

24
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,189
memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she whispers moments into my</font>

25
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,790
mind feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> am now mostly</font>

26
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">blind rewind the tape and the moment</font>

27
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,189
plays the happiest day<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my life as I</font>

28
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:02,490
looked upon her my wife holding the

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,460
small boy that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be my life's pride</font>

30
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,310
the reason for my hard work my every

31
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,950
stride him I laughed and I cried and I

32
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoped and I watched as the years slipped</font>

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,790
by and time turned and edged forward and

34
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,590
I aged in crippled before her and the

35
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,590
man the boy became the man the man

36
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:39,980
gained a mortgage and the wife dreams of

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,349
his own and his very own life and they

38
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:51,280
left me because they couldn't bear me

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,410
barely human broken dreams and fractured

40
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,769
memories hid beneath the veneer of

41
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:07,910
senility I'm father and husband only

42
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:11,660
sometimes anymore if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into my</font>

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,180
eyes you may see what I adored family
