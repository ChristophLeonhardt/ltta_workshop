cheerful friendly Monday and ditch<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

4
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:06,990
internet shopping and self-service

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,210
checkouts who<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants here unexpected item</font>

6
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,670
in bagging area 15 times in one minute

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,139
anyway I do really hate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that about the</font>

8
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:14,700
self-service machines they always<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume</font>

9
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,109
it you have no expected item in the

10
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:17,820
bagging area and you don't today was

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,619
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an exceptional day I woke up</font>

12
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,480
quite an ER and await at six in the

13
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,039
morning and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a lot of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,570
done basically I thought I had to reach

15
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,939
15 articles by 12 and it turns out that

16
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,590
i actually had to read 15 articles by

17
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,990
thursday so not quite the same thing but

18
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,308
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and out of the</font>

19
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,170
way night and early but between 6 30 and

20
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,030
90<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAT and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a cafe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and just read</font>

21
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,559
everything and worked really hard to

22
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,270
cafe go to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recognized look the</font>

23
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,040
people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm pretty good actually when</font>

24
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,420
it comes to smiling<font color="#E5E5E5"> making eye contact</font>

25
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,520
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> shop workers maybe because i've</font>

26
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,350
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working in a shop since i was 16</font>

27
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,640
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i think if you've</font>

28
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,559
been on the other side you're much more

29
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,180
aware of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice it can be to see</font>

30
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,250
someone smiling face and kind of awesome

31
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,660
how their day is going and even just

32
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,920
wishing them to have a nice day like it

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,840
makes it a real difference have just

34
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,789
someone cheery looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> back at you and</font>

35
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,050
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a saving you to walk around</font>

36
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,090
like smiling or tomatoes the whole time

37
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be fake but when</font>

38
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,260
people do genuinely smile for you and i

39
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,640
wish you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good day if you've been</font>

40
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,110
working like for a few hours or if

41
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,430
you've been working at success in the

42
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,750
morning I think it's really really nice

43
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,610
as challenge also<font color="#E5E5E5"> said ain't find out</font>

44
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:15,869
one interesting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sales</font>

45
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">person I didn't really manage to do that</font>

46
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,259
in either of the two conversations I had

47
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in the coffee shop on in the car</font>

48
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,140
on the way back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from campus in the</font>

49
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,729
morning at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of mutual</font>

50
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,100
tiredness coldness been in a very

51
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,080
cheerful way in a very smiley happy

52
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,729
cheerful way then I'm curious to know

53
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:31,439
whether those of you who work in shops

54
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
are in retail just kind of any sector

55
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">that involves a lot of customer service</font>

56
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,390
found this challenge a lot easier than

57
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,130
maybe those of you who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

58
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,299
can only count this from my<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective</font>

59
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,799
so I don't know whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too fair to</font>

60
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that it's a cultural thing in Mexico</font>

61
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,030
at least like it's not acknowledging

62
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,280
someone is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty rude bad thing to do</font>

63
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,570
so I've always<font color="#E5E5E5"> been brought up to make</font>

64
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,890
eye contact and as I said in another

65
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,200
video my mom loves making small talk

66
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,000
loves like chatting with people asking

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,110
him about the day when she's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

68
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,490
passing them in the street and she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

69
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,290
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look down the floor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and walk</font>

70
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,820
pass at all well I think that translates

71
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">into every other interaction you have</font>

72
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,149
with people so I don't know whether that

73
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,770
has made me more kind of responsive when

74
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,210
people look for eye contact and things

75
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,439
like that i wanted to talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

76
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,788
about the film's<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys watched</font>

77
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:10,288
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what I'm finding this I</font>

78
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,970
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a party on Saturday night which</font>

79
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,660
is America

80
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,250
to know when it's kesha but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

81
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,200
checking all the fish on on this memory

82
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,760
card to make sure that had space record

83
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,370
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found a very funny video</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of me</font>

84
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,530
miming to take it off from Kesha this

85
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,820
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I got out so I hadn't even</font>

86
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,110
had anything to drink or anything like

87
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,880
that just me and my natural state couple

88
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,110
of people which<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakfast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tiffany's</font>

89
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,370
for the first time which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> brilliant</font>

90
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,750
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakfast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tiffany's is one of</font>

91
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,250
my all-time favorite films i know that's

92
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,870
a big clich√© and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> university</font>

93
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,340
student has the big breakfast at

94
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,290
tiffany's posters in their in their room

95
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,940
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really lovely phone</font>

96
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a really great adaptation of a</font>

97
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,120
really terrific book it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

98
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,500
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can never really quite tell</font>

99
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,060
whether i prefer the book or the film or

100
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,650
the film does have the advantage of

101
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">george peppard and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Audrey Hepburn a lot</font>

102
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,070
of my favorite dialogue from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the film</font>

103
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,660
was actually just taken verbatim from

104
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the book someone commented back to the</font>

105
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,750
future back-to-back reminds me of

106
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that Kristina said when she</font>

107
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,050
was talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and our friend Ariana</font>

108
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,400
who'd never seen any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back of</font>

109
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,590
future films Christina said Ariana they

110
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,450
go back in time it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

111
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,890
future to that Ariana hunt scene or

112
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,240
something I can't remember Christina

113
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,890
incidentally is doing the new revolution

114
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,750
as well because my<font color="#E5E5E5"> fellow my fellow busy</font>

115
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,970
friend decides that she too needs to get

121
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,600
videos on them on private either because

122
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sound has just been bad because of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">them I used quick capture originally and</font>

124
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,209
the sound some reasons got funny on that

125
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,709
and also just some other like private

126
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:33,690

film ideas and keep commenting what you

130
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,370
thought of it as well because who knows

131
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,959
I might pick from<font color="#CCCCCC"> those so let me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

132
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,040
if you manage to find out an interesting

133
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,989
fact from your shop worker and also just

134
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,610
let me know what your feelings are you

135
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,170
know chatting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shop workers because as</font>

136
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,610
a shop worker I just find it funny when

137
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,800
people when people don't want to talk to

138
00:03:52,800 --> 00:00:00,000
me just cry
