THEM THAT ARE OLD OR DYING OR 
SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE THE 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS, THOSE 
BRANCHES AND TREES ARE EXPECTED 
TO COME DOWN ONTO HOMES AND 
BUILDINGS, WHICH COULD CAUSE 
INJURY OR DEATH. 
THAT IS WHY THEY ARE WANTING TO 
GET PEOPLE INTO SHELTERS AWAY 
FROM TREES BUT ALSO THAT WILL 
CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE 
POWER OUTAGES EXPECTED 
THROUGHOUT THE AREA. 
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH 
LATE AFTERNOON INTO EVENING FOR 
THE TALLAHASSEE AREA AND THEN 
IT MOVES ON OUT OF HERE. 
THEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT 
DAMAGE IT LEFT BEHIND. 
WE SHOULD SHOW THAT AS FAR AS 
POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE WINDS 
GET CONSISTENT AT ABOUT 35 
MILES PER HOUR, AND WE MAY BE 
THERE VERY SOON, THAT IS WHEN 
THE POWER COMPANY SAYS IT'S NO 
LONGER SAFE FOR CREWS TO BE OUT 
AND ABOUT TRYING TO RESTORE 
WHATEVER POWERLINES MAY HAVE 
BEEN KNOCKED DOWN EARLY ON IN 
THE STORM. 
THEY ARE NOT DOING THAT 
ANYMORE. 
SO IT MAY NOT BE TILL TOMORROW 
WHEN THEY GET DAYLIGHT AND THE 
WINDS HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS 
AREA THAT THEY ARE FINALLY ABLE 
TO START CLEARING TREES AND 
TRYING TO RESTORE POWER. 
THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES WHEN IT 
COMES TO RESTORING POWER. 
HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES, 
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, 
THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY WILL 
TRY TO GET BACK ONLINE FIRST. 
CLEARLY, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. 
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 
THE POWER THE MOST AND THE MOST 
QUICKLY, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A 
ROUGH GO HERE IN TALLAHASSEE AS 
WE START TO SEE THOSE REPORTS 
FROM THE COAST AND A SLIGHTLY 
WEAKER VERSION OF MICHAEL 
BEGINS TO MAKE ITS WAY HERE TO 
THE STATE CAPITAL. 
>> MANNY, YOU LIVE IN MIAMI FOR 
YOU KNOW ABOUT HURRICANE 
COVERAGE AND PREPARATION. 
I'M JUST CURIOUS, THE FOLKS YOU 
HAVE SPOKEN TO, WHAT ARE THE 
STORES LIKE THEIR AND WHAT HAVE 
YOU DONE TO PREPARE AND WHAT DO 
PEOPLE ADVISE YOU TO DO WHEN 
YOU KNOW THIS IS COMING? 
>> WELL, WE GOT HERE AND, AS 
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LAND IN ONE 
OF THESE AREAS RIGHT BEFORE A 
DISASTER, YOU LOOK FOR WATER 
FOR YOUR CREW AND YOURSELF. 
THE FIRST WALMART I WENT TO WAS 
OUT OF BREAD AND WATER. 
SO PEOPLE DID PREPARE. 
THERE WERE GAS LINES. 
WE ARE NOT SEEING MANY OF THOSE 
NOW AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE GAS 
STATIONS HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP 
UP THEIR PUMPS HOPING TO SAVE 
THEM FROM WATER DAMAGE. 
WE HAVE HEARD THE OFFICIALS SAY 
IT OVER AND OVER, IF YOU ARE NO 
LONGER PREPARED OR IF YOU ARE 
STILL TRYING TO PREPARE, I 
SHOULD SAY, THE TIME IS UP. 
RIGHT NOW IT IS BRACED FOR IT, 
HUNKER DOWN, GET INDOORS TO THE 
INNERMOST PART OF ANY BUILDING. 
YOU MENTIONED THE LESSONS 
LEARNED FROM LIVING IN SOUTH 
FLORIDA ESPECIALLY AT, LAST 
YEAR. 
YOU'LL RECALL THE HORRIBLE 
INCIDENT AT A NURSING HOME 
WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER THE 
POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOUR DAYS 
AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET 
THE POWER BACK TO THE BUILDING. 
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 
GENERATOR. 
THERE IS A NEW LINE FLORIDA 
AIMING TO PREVENT THAT KIND OF 
TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING AGAIN 
AND REQUIRING ALL NURSING HOMES 
AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES 
TO HAVE GENERATORS. 
BUT AFTER THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 
1st PAST, NUMBERS SHOW A LOT OF 
THOSE FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN 
THIS AREA, DO NOT HAVE THOSE 
INSTALLED JUST YET FOR MANY 
REASONS. 
ZONING REGULATIONS. 
WE ARE TOLD THERE IS A LABOR 
SHORTAGE AND A SHORTAGE OF 
THOSE SUPPLIES, BUT THEY STILL 
HAVE TO PROVE THEY CAN KEEP 
RESIDENTS SAFE AND THAT 
SOMETHING THE STATE IS LOOKING 
VERY CLOSELY INTO AND THAT'S 
WHY THE POWER COMPANIES ARE 
LOOKING TO PRIORITIZE THOSE 
AREAS TO PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. 
AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE TREES, 
THEY REALLY GET GOING. 
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THAT IT'S 
STARTING TO BECOME A LITTLE BIT 
MORE CONSISTENT. 
IT'S NO LONGER ONCE EVERY 10 
MINUTES, IT'S STARTING TO 
BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A 
REGULAR FLOW THROUGH HERE. 
CLEARLY, MICHAEL IS GETTING 
CLOSER. 
>> INTERESTING YOU CAN PREDICT 
THAT BY LOOKING AT THE TREES 
FOR YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
PLEASE STAY SAFE. 
WE WILL CHECK IN THROUGHOUT THE 
AFTERNOON. 
>> AND WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE 
COVERAGE WHEN WE RETURN. 
FOR NOW, A QUICK BREAK. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> WELL, WE ARE GOING TO BE 
TRACKING THE DANGEROUS 
CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
AND WE WILL GET YOU CAUGHT UP 
ON THE OTHER NEWS AS WELL. 
THE SEARCH IS ON FOR THE 
REPLACEMENT FOR NIKKI HALEY, 
AND IN AN UNEXPECTED MOVE, SHE 
ANNOUNCED SHE IS RESIGNING AS 
U.S. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. 
SHE'LL BE LEAVING THE POST AT 
THE END OF THE YEAR. 
SHE SAYS SHE WILL RETURN TO THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR. 
SEVERAL NAMES HAVE SURFACED AS 
POSSIBLE REPLACEMENTS, 
INCLUDING FORMER WHITE HOUSE 
AIDE DENA POWELL AND THE FORMER 
U.S. SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN. 
HERE'S WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAD 
TO SAY ABOUT THE SEARCH TODAY. 
>> DENA DID GREAT HERE. 
SHE THEN WENT BACK INTO THE 
PRIVATE SECTOR FOR A WHILE, BUT 
SHE ALWAYS WANTED TO COME BACK. 
SHE LOVES THIS ADMINISTRATION. 
SO WE ARE LOOKING AT DENA AND 
OTHERS. 
SOME TREMENDOUSLY TALENTED 
PEOPLE. 
>> JOINING ME NOW IS A REPORTER 
FOR POLITICAL AND CO-AUTHOR OF 
POLITICAL PLAYBOOK. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS, WHAT ARE 
YOU HEARING ABOUT HOW THE 
SEARCH IS PROCEEDING AND THE 
POTENTIAL NAMES BEING FLOATED? 
>> I THINK SHE IS AT THE TOP OF 
THE LIST. 
SHE DESCRIBED THIS AS A DREAM 
JOB TO FRIENDS. 
SHE WORKS AT GOLDMAN SACHS NOW 
AND WHERE SHE WORKED BEFORE THE 
ADMINISTRATION, SHE DOES HAVE 
STATE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER 
WHITE HOUSE EXPERIENCE, SO SHE 
IS SEEN AS THE RARE CANDIDATE 
WHO IS SATISFACTORY TO THE 
ESTABLISHMENT. GOLDMAN SACHS IS 
KIND OF THE DEFINITION OF THE 
ESTABLISHMENT, BUT SHE'S CLOSE 
WITH TOM COTTEN, DONALD TRUMP, 
TRUMPS KIDS, AND SO WE SHOULD 
KEEP AN EYE ON HER. 
OTHER CANDIDATES INCLUDE RICK 
GRENELL, THE U.S. AMBASSADOR OF 
GERMANY, ALTHOUGH TRUMP THREW 
COLD WATER ON THAT SAYING THAT 
WE LIKE RICK THERE, INDICATING 
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BRING HIM 
BACK JUST YET. 
>> WHAT SORT OF CAUGHT OUR EYE 
WAS IN AN INTERVIEW TODAY, THE 
FORMER WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST 
STEVE BANNON CALLED THE TIMING 
OF THE RESIGNATION HORRIFIC AND 
SAYS IT'S A GOOD DISTRACTION 
FROM TRUMPS GOOD TALKING POINTS 
HEADING INTO MIDTERMS. 
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? 
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE REACTION 
FROM BANNON? 
WE HAVE SEEN BREITBART PUSHING 
BACK HARD AS TO WHY DINA POWELL 
SHOULD NOT MAKE IT ON AS U.S. 
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.? 
>> THEY'VE ALWAYS HAD IT IN FOR 
POWELL. 
THEY SEE HER AS A GLOBALIST WHO 
WORKS FOR A TOP INVESTMENT 
BANK, AND THEY DON'T THINK THAT 
POWELL REPRESENTS WHAT THE, YOU 
KNOW, AMERICAN VOTERS STOOD FOR 
WHEN ELECTING TRUMP A YEAR AND 
A HALF AGO, AND SO IT'S VERY 
CONCERNING TO THEM THAT DINA 
WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THIS 
JOB. 
YOU KNOW, THEY SAVAGELY 
ATTACKED HER WHEN SHE WAS IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE, AND SO NOT A 
HUGE SURPRISE BANNON IS MAKING 
THOSE COMMENTS. 
BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S 
INTERESTING THAT HE IS, 
BASICALLY, ATTACKING NIKKI 
HALEY CALLED TRUMP REALLY LIKES 
AND SHE IS LIVING ON HER OWN 
TERMS, NOT GETTING PUSHED OUT 
TO YOU SHE HAD A PRETTY 
POSITIVE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH 
TRUMP YESTERDAY, AND SO NOT 
TOTALLY CLEAR WHY BANNON IS 
GOING AFTER ONE OF TRUMPS 
FAVORITE PEOPLE. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
GRATEFUL TO GET YOU ON AND 
TALKS IN POLITICS. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
>> THANKS, REENA. 
>>> WE TURNED BACK TO HURRICANE 
MATTHEW. 
JEFF JOINS US NOW. 
THE EYE WALL, YOU WERE TELLING 
ME, IS MAKING LANDFALL AT THIS 
VERY MOMENT. 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
>> WELL, IT MEANS A VERY LARGE 
TORNADO IS RIGHT ON TOP OF THE 
COAST RIGHT NOW. 
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD COMPARE 
THIS HURRICANE TOO. 
SO OFTEN THE STORMS WE CAN AS 
THEY MAKE LANDFALL. 
THIS ONE IS STRENGTHENING AS IT 
MAKES LANDFALL AND I THINK IT 
IS IMPORTANT TO MENTION. 
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS A LONG 
TIME. 
I LIVED IN FLORIDA DOING 
HURRICANES FOR YEARS. 
MIAMI, TAMPA, PALM BEACH. I CAN 
TELL YOUFOR SURE THAT STORMS 
STRENGTHEN AS THEY MAKE 
LANDFALL. 
THEY MAKE A LOT MORE LANDFALL 
THAN IF THEY ARE WEAKENING. 
THEY HAVE THAT UPWARD MOMENTUM, 
SO THE STORM IS GOING TO BE I 
THINK A PIVOTAL AND KIND OF 
LIFE-CHANGING MOMENT FOR A LOT 
OF FOLKS THAT LIVES NEAR PANAMA 
CITY. 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF 
DESTRUCTION TO HOMES THERE. 
HOPEFULLY, AT THIS TIME PEOPLE 
ARE ALREADY IN THEIR SAFE 
SPACE, BECAUSE THEY CAN HEAR 
THE WIND PICKING UP 
TREMENDOUSLY. 
ALMOST CATEGORY 5. 
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, 
EXACTLY? 
WE THROUGH THAT AROUND, BUT 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? 
>> ABOUT AS STRONG AS IT CAN 
GET. 
MARIA HAD WINS AROUND 155 MILES 
PER HOUR. 
THIS TERM HAS WINDS OF 150. 
STRUCTURES, THEORETICALLY, ARE 
BUILT A LITTLE BETTER HERE THAN 
THEY ARE IN PUERTO RICO. 
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, A LOT OF 
THESE STRUCTURES ARE 
UNCONTESTED. 
ALL OF THEM ARE UNTESTED IN 
CATEGORY 4. THIS IS THE STRONG 
STORM TO HIT THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE, STRONGEST STORM TO 
HIT THE U.S. IN THE MONTH OF 
OCTOBER. 
HOMES IN FLORIDA AFTER 
HURRICANE ANDREW WERE BUILT 
BETTER. 
ANY HOME BUILT AFTER 1995 OR SO 
SHOULD BE WILL -- SHOULD BE 
BUILT TO WITHSTAND CATEGORY 3. 
TO BE HONEST, NOT NECESSARILY 
BUILT TO WITHSTAND CATEGORY 4. 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE IS A 
LOT OF DESTRUCTION. 
>> JEFF, AT THIS TIME WE KNOW 
IT'S MAKING LANDFALL ACROSS THE 
PANHANDLE. 
WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING WHEN IT 
COMES TO HURRICANE MICHAEL 
QUESTION WORK. 
>> THE STORM SURGE IS COMING 
IN. 
I TRIED TO REACH THE WEBSITE TO 
SEE HOW HIGH THE WATER LEVELS 
ARE. 
PROBABLY EVERYONE IS TRYING TO 
SEE HOW HIGH THE WATER IS 
GETTING. 
IT WAS ALREADY IN RECORD 
TERRITORY. 
I CAN IMAGINE IT IS COMING ON 
SHORT AND IS LIKELY TO BE AS 
HIGH AS 15 FEET. PLACES LIKE 
PORT SAINT JOE, APALACHICOLA, 
PANAMA CITY, THAT AREA COULD BE 
10 TO 15 FEET. 
THAT IS DEVASTATING. 
WORSE THAN IT WAS WITH 
FLORENCE, AND WINS MUCH WORSE 
THAN IT WAS WITH FLORENCE. 
FLORENCE WAS CATEGORY 1 ON 
SHORT. 
THIS IS CATEGORY 4. I WOULD 
COMPARE THIS TO HURRICANE 
CHARLEY. 
I SEE YOU NODDING YOUR HEAD. 
THAT STORM, IF YOU DROVE PAST 
THE DAMAGE, IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG 
TORNADO BULLDOZED A PATH 
THROUGH THE AREA. 
THIS IS BIGGER THAN THAT. 
THIS IS A STORM PEOPLE REMEMBER 
FOR A VERY LONG TIME. 
>> HOW DO YOU PREPARE? 
I WAS TALKING WITH MANNY ABOUT 
THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. 
WE HEARD THE DHS SECRETARY SAY 
YOU'VE GOT TO GET THAT BAG AND 
GET PREPARED BEFORE IT ACTUALLY 
STRIKES. 
>> TRUE. 
IT'S TOO LATE NOW. 
PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO BE HUNKERED 
DOWN IN THEIR HOMES. 
WHEN WE PREDICT CATEGORY 3, WE 
TELL YOU TO PREPARE FOR 
CATEGORY 4. WE KNEW THE 
POSSIBILITY THIS COULD BE 
CATEGORY 4, AND IT IS. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE STORM IS 
MOVING FAST. 
THE WORST OF IT IS FROM NOW 
THROUGH THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR 
HOURS. 
SOME PEOPLE END UP INSIDE THE 
EYE, WHICH MEANS IT MAY CLEAR 
AND THINGS MAY COME DOWN FOR 10 
OR 15 MINUTES. 
DON'T BE FULL. 
IT'S GOING TO PICK UP BIG TIME 
ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE STORM AS 
WELL, BUT I THINK THE WORST OF 
IT IN PLACES GETTING HIT 
HARDEST WILL BE THE NEXT FOUR 
HOURS. 
THAT MEANS EARLY THIS EVENING 
THERE WILL BE HURRICANE FORCE 
WINDS, BUT IT WILL BE GETTING 
BETTER. 
BY LATE THIS EVENING YOU MAY BE 
ABLE TO STEP OUTSIDE AND SEE 
WHAT'S HAPPENING OUTSIDE YOUR 
DOOR, AND BY TOMORROW, IF THE 
ROADS ARE CLEARED AND THERE IS 
NOT POWER LINES AND TREES DOWN, 
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO CHECK ON 
YOUR HOUSE. 
MOST PEOPLE WON'T BE ABLE TO 
IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE THERE WILL 
BE POWER LINES AND TREES DOWN. 
ONE OTHER THING I SHOULD 
MENTION, A LOT OF TIMES WHEN 
THESE HURRICANES HIT IN AUGUST, 
YOU DON'T HAVE AIR-CONDITIONING 
FOR TWO OR THREE WEEKS. 
THE GOOD NEWS WITH OCTOBER'S 
IT'S COOLER. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFER INJURY 
AFTER JUST BECAUSE THERE'S NO 
AIR-CONDITIONING FOR WEEKS. 
IN THIS CASE, COOLER AIR WILL 
GET IN. 
ONE MORE THING, IT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH GEORGIA AND THE 
CAROLINAS. 
THE CAROLINA RIVERS ARE 
SWOLLEN. 
ANOTHER SIX TO 8 INCHES OF RAIN 
COULD BE POTENTIALLY 
DEVASTATING AGAIN IN THOSE 
FLOOD PRONE AREAS. 
>> THAT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR 
YOU SAY. 
WE NEVER TALK ABOUT AIR TRAVEL. 
HOW DOES THIS IMPACT PEOPLE WHO 
ARE FLYING? 
>> YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE. 
I MEAN, YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE. 
I WOULDN'T ADVISE IT ANYWAY. 
>> YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT 
TAMPA. 
IF YOU'RE FLYING INTO THESE 
AREAS, EXPECT DELAYS AND FLIGHT 
CANCELLATIONS. 
>> TO BE HONEST, I HAVEN'T 
CHECKED WHAT'S HAPPENING IN 
TAMPA. 
TAMPA WAS UNDER A TROPICAL 
STORM WARNING, SO I HAVE TO 
THINK THEY ARE NOT FLYING OUT 
OF THEIR AT THE MOMENT. 
MIAMI IS PRETTY FAR AWAY. 
AIRLINES WILL DO THEIR BEST TO 
AVOID THE TURBULENCE AND AVOID 
THE STORM, BUT AT THIS TIME, 
EXPECT DELAYS IF YOU ARE 
TRAVELING ANYWHERE IN THE U.S. 
>> GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US, 
JEFF. 
>>> WE TAKE YOU NOW TO A 
SPECIAL REPORT IN PROGRESS. 
>>> WE ARE SLIGHTLY INLAND, 
THOUGH STILL IN PANAMA CITY 
BEACH. 
WE ARE GETTING ANOTHER BIG GUST 
COMING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. 
I DID TALK TO THE MANAGER HERE 
FOR PANAMA CITY BEACH A SHORT 
TIME AGO. 
HE ESTIMATED 50% OF RESIDENCE 
ACTUALLY LEFT THE AREA. 
HE SAID THAT FLORIDIANS, IN HIS 
WORDS, CAN GET COMPLACENT WITH 
STORMS BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN 
SO MANY BEFORE BUT THEY HAVE 
NOT SEEN MANY LIKE THIS ONE. 
AT THIS TIME, OFFICIALS HAVE 
STOPPED RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY 
CALLS. 
I THINK EMERGENCY WORKERS 
ALWAYS WANT TO GET OUT AND HELP 
SOMEONE IF THEY CAN. 
THEY ALSO DON'T WANT TO PUT 
THEMSELVES IN DANGER, SO YOU 
ARE NOT SEEING THEM RESPOND AT 
THIS HOUR. 
IN TERMS OF OUR LOCATION, IT 
DID GET VERY BAD FOR THE WIND 
STARTED TO PICK UP ABOUT AN 
HOUR, HOUR AND A HALF AGO. 
AS I MENTIONED, THE LIGHTS HAVE 
BEEN FLICKERING ON AND OFF, 
WHICH IS TYPICAL IN A HURRICANE 
LIKE THIS. 
WE LOST POWER FOR GOOD A LITTLE 
MORE THAN A HALF HOUR AGO OR IT 
HAS NOT COME BACK ON. 
SO WE ARE ON GENERATOR POWER AT 
THIS TIME. 
OBVIOUSLY, THING TO WATCH OUT 
FOR IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS, 
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SLIGHTLY 
SHIELDED HERE, FOR ANYBODY OUT 
AND ABOUT, WATCH FOR 
PROJECTIS, WHICH CAN DO SOME 
OF THE WORST DAMAGE. 
OF COURSE, WHAT OFFICIALS 
REALLY CAUTION OF, THE WIND IS 
HORRENDOUS. 
FAR WORSE THAN A LOT OF FOLKS 
EXPECTED. 
KEEP IN MIND, THIS WENT FROM A 
TROPICAL STORM TO WHAT I 
BELIEVE IS ALMOST A CATEGORY 5 
STORM IN ABOUT 72 HOURS OR SO. 
SO AS -- LONNIE CAN TALK MORE 
ABOUT THAT. 
AS BAD AS THE WINDS ARE, AS HE 
KNOWS AS WELL, ONE OF THE BIG 
CONCERNS AS IT WAS DURING 
HURRICANE FLORENCE AND EVERY 
OTHER HURRICANE IS PEOPLE 
DRIVING IN THESE CONDITIONS. 
WHEN THE FLASH FLOODS HAPPEN, 
15 OR 10 INCHES OF RAIN FALLS 
IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND 
THE ROAD FILLED UP AND SOMEBODY 
TRIES TO DRIVE THROUGH IT, NOT 
A GOOD IDEA. 
>> NOBODY SHOULD BE ON THE 
ROAD. 
VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. 
ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT 
EVERY HURRICANE IS DIFFERENT. 
WE REMEMBER YOU WITH HURRICANE 
FLORENCE. 
BACK THEN IT WAS REALLY ALL 
ABOUT THE RAIN. 
NOW JEFF IS MENTIONING ALL 
ABOUT THE WIND. 
WE ARE GOING TO PORT SAINT JOE, 
FLORIDA. 
ALSO EXPERIENCING HEAVY WIND 
GUSTS. 
HOW ARE THE CONDITIONS THERE? 
>> Reporter: THEY ARE NOT GOOD 
AT ALL. IN THE LAST HALF HOUR, 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY STOUT 
GUSTS AROUND HERE. 
ANOTHER THING WE ARE SEEING IS 
PIECES OF BUILDINGS ARE 
STARTING TO FLY OFF. 
WE ARE KIND OF GARDEN RIGHT 
HERE FROM A HOTEL, BUT WE ARE 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 
NOT GOING TO BE IN THE PATH OF 
PROJECTILES. 
WE HAVE SEEN A FEW TREES SNAP 
IN HALF AND FALL DOWN. 
THIS WHOLE AREA HERE IS WITHOUT 
POWER. 
STORM SURGE, OBVIOUSLY, IS A 
BIG DEAL. 
THAT'S THE BIG KILLER AND 
HURRICANES. 
JUST IN A MATTER OF MINUTES, WE 
SAW A FEW INCHES TURN TO MORE 
THAN A FOOT AND A HALF. 
SO THAT STORM SURGE IS COMING. 
SOME OF THE BEACHES HERE IN 
PORT SAINT JOE HAD A VERY 
SHALLOW BEACH, NOT A BUNCH OF 
BUFFER AREA. 
AS SOON AS MICHAEL IS COMING 
CLOSER AND CLOSES, THE -- 
CLOSER, THE BEACHES WERE 
SWALLOWED UP. 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WIND. 
THE TREES AND SHRUBBERY, IT 
SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE WAVING 
BEHIND ME. 
IT'S NOT JUST COMING ONE WAY. 
THESE WIND GUSTS ARE SWIRLING 
ALL OVER CAUSING A LOT OF 
HAVOC. 
THE GOOD THING IS WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE 
ROADS. 
THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES MAKING 
SURE PEOPLE ARE OKAY. 
PEOPLE HERE ARE HEEDING THE 
WARNINGS OR THE DEPUTIES ARE 
DOING MINOR CRUISES WHERE THEY 
CAN DRIVE, BECAUSE THEY ARE 
ALSO HUNKERING DOWN. 
THE HOSPITAL IS CLOSED, THE 
AMBULANCE ARE FURTHER INLAND, 
AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF THE 
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS TOLD ME 
THAT IF YOU HAVE A MEDICAL 
EMERGENCY NOW, THEY ARE NOT 
ABLE TO GET TO YOU TILL AFTER 
THE HURRICANE PASSES. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR 
WHAT'S GOING ON AND LET YOU 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. 
>> PLEASE BE SAFE WHILE YOU DO 
THAT. 
THOSE TREES SWAYING BEHIND YOU 
MAKE A LOT OF US HERE WATCHING 
YOU VERY NERVOUS. 
WE ALSO WANT TO BRING VIEWERS 
BREAKING NEWS THAT THE STORM 
HAS OFFICIALLY MADE LANDFALL. 
THE CENTER HAS HIT SURE. 
IT IS OFFICIALLY NOW HITTING 
THE COAST OF FLORIDA. 
AS WE SAID, THIS IS A HISTORIC 
HURRICANE, WIND SPEEDS OF 150 
MILES PER HOUR. 
WE KNOW THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN 
BRIEFED BY HIS HOMELAND 
SECURITY SECRETARY AS WELL. 
HE MAY BE VISITING THE AREA 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET 
IN THE WAY OF ANY OF THE SEARCH 
AND RECOVERY AS PEOPLE ARE 
HUNKERING DOWN. 
PLEASE STAY OFF THE ROADS. 
WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED AND THE 
GOVERNOR HAS ADVISED THOSE 
PEOPLE THERE AS WELL. 
OF COURSE, WE WILL CONTINUE 
TRACKING THE STORM THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY AND INTO THE NIGHT. 
THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE ON YOUR 
LOCAL NEWS ON THIS CBS STATION 
AT OUR 24 HOUR STREAMING NEWS 
SERVICE, CBSN. 
OF COURSE, TONIGHT WITH THE CBS 
EVENING NEWS REPORTING FROM THE 
FLORIDA PANHANDLE. 
CBS NEWS, NEW YORK. 
>>> FOR NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY, GO 
TO CBS NEWS.COM. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SPOKE 
WITH FEMA ADMINISTRATOR BROCK 
LONG AND HOMELAND SECURITY 
SECRETARY KIERSTEN NELSON ABOUT 
THE IMPENDING THREAT OF 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY 
ABOUT THE EVACUATIONS. 
>> THEY ARE ALL EITHER 
CONTACTED OR ARE IN THE 
PROCESS. 
I HAD A LONG TALK WITH GOVERNOR 
SCOTT OF FLORIDA. 
VERY WELL COORDINATED WITH ALL 
OF THE STATES. 
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT MUST BE SAID IS IT'S NOT 
SO EASY FOR SOME OF THESE 
PEOPLE TO LEAVE. 
SOME OF THE AREAS ARE VERY 
POOR. 
NOT EASY FOR A PERSON WITHOUT 
THE NECESSARY MONEY TO LEAVE. 
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS SENT 
BUSES. 
WE SPENT A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- 
WE ARE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
THINGS TO TRY TO REMOVE PEOPLE 
FROM THE AREA, BUT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE ARE VERY POOR IN CERTAIN 
OF THOSE AREAS, AND IT'S TOUGH 
FOR THEM TO LEAVE. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU 
ARE FINDING I GUESS. 
>> IN SOME CASES, YOU KNOW, 
WHAT WE ASKED TO DO ON BLUE SKY 
DAYS IS AS PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT 
HAVE THE MEANS OR MECHANISMS TO 
GET OUT OF TOWN TO REGISTER 
WITH THE LOCAL EMERGENCY 
MANAGEMENT AGENCIES. 
FLORIDA HAS BEEN PRETTY ROBUST. 
WE HAVE SOME IDEA HOW TO PLAN 
FOR THAT. 
WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO SUPPORT 
THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE. 
WHEN IT COMES TO GEORGIA, YOU 
KNOW, WE ARE NOT EVACUATING 
FOUR STORM SURGE IN GEORGIA. 
THIS IS HIGH WINDS. 
SO WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET 
WITHIN A FACILITY THAT CAN 
WITHSTAND THE WINDS AND TRY TO 
SHELTER IN PLACE OR SEEK OUT 
PUBLIC SHELTERS THAT MAY BE 
OPEN IN SOUTHWEST GEORGIA. 
>> LOOK AT THE SIZE, HOW LONG 
IT IS. 
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND THE RED 
AREA, BASICALLY, IS THE AREA 
IT'S GOING TO HIT PRETTY 
HEAVILY. 
THAT'S A LOT OF SURE. 
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND. 
>> STORM SURGE ALL THE WAY DOWN 
TO TAMPA BAY, WHICH IS VERY LOW-
LYING AND FLOODS VERY EASILY. 
TO GIVE YOU THAT IDEA OF THE 
BREADTH OF ITS PAST, IT IS 
QUITE LARGE. 
>> IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE 
OF THE GULF. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT TOPICALLY, 
IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE, 
AND THEY HAVE NOT SEEN THAT -- 
MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT AT 
ALL. 
NOBODY SEEN THAT BEFORE. 
>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 
MONITORING HURRICANE MICHAEL AS 
IT MAKES LANDFALL. 
THOSE DAMAGING WINDS AT 150 
MILES PER HOUR. 
WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN, AWAYS 
ON. 
>>> THE WINDS ARE FEROCIOUS, 
GUSTING ABOUT 120 MILES PER 
HOUR. 
>> THE ISLAND IS STILL 
STRUGGLING TO RECOVER, AND MANY 
ARE WONDERING IF IT EVER WILL. 
PUERTO RICO IS IN THE THROES OF 
AN EXODUS THAT DRAINED THE 
ISLAND OF ITS MOST VALUABLE 
RESOURCE, IT'S PEOPLE. 
>> THE MOST OBVIOUS SIGN IS THE 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT HAVE 
BEEN SHUT DOWN ACROSS THE 
ISLAND. 
>> THE MAGNITUDE OF MARIA WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY HARD 
TO PLAN FOR. 
>> I WILL DIE TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT PUERTO RICO BECOMES A 
PLACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE 
OPPORTUNITY. 
>> SPENT ON THE CBS EVENING 
NEWS FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE, 
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY. 
>> AT 12:00 NOON, HIGH TIDE 
ROLLED IN. 
>> RIGHT NOW YOU CANNOT TELL 
THE RIVERS FROM THE ROADS. 
>> THIS IS A MASSIVE OAK TREE 
THAT WAS TOPPLED. 
>> FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES, 
THEY ARE HOPING THAT THEY WILL 
STILL HAVE HOMES TO RETURN TO. 
>> THIS IS THE WORST IT'S EVER 
BEEN. 
>> THIS IS SCARY. 
>> THIS IS THE WORST OF 
FLORENCE. 
>>> WE WENT TO TEXAS TO 
INTERVIEW BOTH CANDIDATES AND 
ONE OF THE COUNTRIES MOST 
CLOSELY WATCHED POLITICAL 
RACES. 
>> SENATOR CRUISE IS A 
CONSERVATIVE ICON. 
>> WHY IS THIS RACE AS CLOSE AS 
IT IS? 
>> TRYING TO SELL AN AGGRESSIVE 
AGENDA. 
>> WHY NOW? 
>>> SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 
POMPEO IS NEAR NORAH. 
>> HAVE ANY NATIONAL INSPECTORS 
BEEN INSIDE NORTH KOREA? 
>>> WELL, PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WEIGHING IN ON THE 
DISAPPEARANCE OF A PROMINENT 
JOURNALISTS. 
THE SURVEILLANCE JOURNALIST -- 
SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS HIM 
GOING INSIDE THE CONSULATE 
BUILDING LAST WEEK. 
HE WAS THERE TO GET THE PROPER 
PAPERWORK. 
TO MARRY HIS FIANCC. 
HE HAS NOT BEEN SEEN SINCE 
THEN. 
EARLIER PRESIDENT TRUMP 
ADDRESSED AN OP-ED. 
HE SAID THE WOMAN WILL BE 
INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> WE HAVE A CALL INTO HIS 
WIFE. 
HIS WIFE WROTE US A LETTER AND 
ADDRESSED IT TO MY WIFE AND 
MYSELF, AND WE ARE IN CONTACT 
WITH HER NOW AND WE WANT TO 
BRING HER TO THE WHITE HOUSE. 
IT'S A VERY SAD SITUATION. 
IT'S A VERY BAD SITUATION, AND 
WE WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF 
IT. 
>>  
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT. 
I HOPE HE IS NOT. 
>>  
>> I HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO DID 
IT. 
PEOPLE SAW HIM GO IN BUT THEY 
DID NOT SEE THEM COME OUT, AS I 
UNDERSTAND IT. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A VERY 
SERIOUS LOOK AT IT. 
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING. 
>> WE ARE ALSO FOUND EXPLOSIVE 
NEW DETAILS. 
THE TRICK IS NEWS CHANNEL HAS 
RELEASED THE PICTURES OF WHAT 
THEY ARE CALLING THE HIT SQUAD 
ARRIVING IN TURKEY TO KILL. 
THE SQUAD REPORTEDLY ENTERED 
AND LEFT THE CONSULATE WHERE HE 
WAS LAST SEEN. 
JOINING THE ONSET MUSTAFA, A 
FELLOW AT THE INSTITUTE. 
IF IT IS DEFINITIVE THAT SAUDI 
ARABIA WAS BEHIND THIS 
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, WHAT 
ROLE SHOULD THE U.S. BE PLAYING 
NOW AND IF THAT IS CONFIRMED? 
>> WELL, I'M GLAD THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SPOKE ABOUT 
THIS. 
THE U.S. SHOULD WAIT ON THIS. 
THEY SHOULD NOT JUST BUY INTO IT
, FIRST OF ALL. 
THEY ARE SAYING WE DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. 
HE CAME IN AND HE CAME OUT. 
THAT'S NOT CREDIBLE. 
HIS FIANCC WAS WAITING. 
HE NEVER CAME OUT. 
I THINK THE TURKISH POLICE 
RIGHT NOW HAVE A LOT OF 
CRIMINAL EVIDENCE SHOWING THE 
SPECIAL TEAM FROM SAUDI ARABIA 
CAME BECAUSE THEY KNEW HE WAS 
COMING THAT DAY. 
HE CAME THERE FOUR DAYS AGO TO 
GET THE PAPERS. 
SO I HIT SQUAD, AS YOU SAID. 
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE ARE 
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. 
WE KNOW THAT FROM THE EVIDENCE. 
SO THEY CAME TO KILL OR CAPTURE 
HIM SOMEHOW, BUT HIS FACE IS 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT. 
THEY WERE CAUGHT RED-HANDED, I 
THINK IN THIS CASE. 
>> THE FRONT PAGE OF A 
PROMINENT TURKISH NEWSPAPER HAD 
THEIR IMAGES. 
THAT FULL SCREEN SHOWING ALL 15 
OF THE PEOPLE THEY BELIEVED 
WERE, IN FACT, INVOLVED. 
DO WE HAVE THAT IMAGE? 
RIGHT THERE. 
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THE 
TURKISH AUTHORITIES ARE SAYING 
WERE INVOLVED AS PART OF THE 
HIT SQUAD. 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THESE 
PEOPLE? 
>> THEY ARE IDENTIFIED BY THE 
TURKISH POLICE, AND A FEW OF 
THEM ARE ALSO KNOWN AS PEOPLE 
WHO ARE IN THE MILITARY, SO 
THEY ARE NOT ANYBODY. EVEN MORE 
IMPORTANT THAN THESE PHOTOS IS 
THE VIDEO FOOTAGE THAT THE 
TURKISH POLICE RELEASE. 
IT SHOWS HIM ENTERING BUT NEVER 
GETTING OUT. 
IT SHOWS A LITTLE BEFORE HIS 
ENTRANCE THESE GUYS CAME AND 
THERE WAS A BLACK MAN AND A 
BLACK MAN WAS THERE FOR SEVERAL 
HOURS AND THEN CAME OUT AND 
WENT TO THE RESIDENCE. 
I THINK EVERYTHING IS SEEN IN 
THAT FOOTAGE THAT HE WAS 
CAPTURED. 
ALSO, THE PEOPLE AT THE 
EMBASSY, THE TURKISH PEOPLE, 
THE LOCALS SAY, TAKE THIS 
AFTERNOON OFF. 
THERE'S AN IMPORTANT MEETING 
TODAY. 
THAT'S ALL SUSPICIOUS. 
I THINK THE ONLY THING WE DON'T 
KNOW IS WHETHER THEY KILLED 
THEM ALREADY OR SOMEHOW THEY 
TOOK HIM ALIVE. 
THAT'S STILL UNCLEAR BUT IT'S 
POSSIBLE THEY MAY HAVE KILLED 
HIM. 
THE TURKISH POLICE THINK HIS 
BODY WAS THE NUMBERS INTO 
PIECES TO BE TAKEN AWAY IN 
BOXES OR BURIED. 
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WEIGHING IN. 
HE WANTS FIANCC TO COME TO THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
WHY HAVE WE HEARD FROM THE 
WORLD? 
HOW DID EMIRATES CUSTOMER SITE 
NO ONE ELSE WEIGH IN ON THIS? 
>> MOST COUNTRIES ARE NOT GREAT 
ON YOU SHOULD SAY THAT. 
ALSO A PLACE YOU HAVE 
MENTIONED, THEY ARE ALLIES. 
EACH OF GOING AFTER CRITICS. 
HONESTLY, THEY ARE NOT AS 
FREEDOM. 
THIS IS TOO WILD FOR TURKISH 
STANDARDS. 
I THINK ON THE TURKEY IS ON THE 
RIGHT-SIDE. 
WHILE YOU CAN EXPECT DICTATORS 
OF ADDICTION TO COME OUT AND 
SPEAK FOR FREE SPEECH, WE 
EXPECT THAT FROM FREE COUNTRY 
IN IT SINCE I THINK U.S. 
LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD WHICH 
HAS THE I THINK IS STILL 
IMPORTANT. 
I THINK THE U.S. SHOULD COMES 
IN BLACK AND KATE SAY, WE TALK 
TO THEM, THEY SAID THEY DON'T 
KNOW. 
>> GAVE WOMEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
DRIVE. 
EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT WAS 
AMAZING. 
HE HAS TAKEN LEBANESE PRIME 
MINISTER, BUT IT WILL. SAUDI 
ARABIA, KEPT HIM THERE. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR HIM WHO 
WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIS IMAGE 
OF? 
>> FRUSTRATING FOR MUSLIMS LIKE 
MYSELF. 
YOU? 
UNFORTUNATELY, YES. 
SOME GOOD REFORMS TOOK PLACE IN 
SUDI ARABIA. 
BUT I THINK PEOPLE LIKE 
MOHAMMED ARE DOING THESE THINGS 
TO GET BROWNIE POINTS IN THE 
WEST AND THEN USE THAT 
AUTHORITY AND THAT POPULARITY 
TO CRACK DOWN ON THIS AND 
BECOME RULERS. 
IT'S A VERY BRUTAL REGIME, MORE 
BRUTAL THAN WHAT WAS THERE. 
THEY SHOULD NOT GET AWAY WITH 
THIS, AND I THINK THE FREE ONE 
-- FREE WORLD SHOULD CELEBRATE 
THE FACT THAT WOMEN DRIVE, BUT 
THE FACT THAT CRITICS ARE BEING 
KILLED IS NOT SOMETHING THAT 
CAN BE TOLERATED. 
>> GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US 
TO TALK ABOUT THIS. 
APPRECIATE IT. 
>> MY PLEASURE. 
>>> WE TURN TO MORE ON 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
>> THAT TELLS ME THE STORM IS 
RIGHT IN HERE. 
THAT'S WHERE THE CENTER IS. 
NOTICE PANAMA CITY, 46 MILE-PER-
HOUR WINDS. 
APALACHICOLA, 58. 
THE WIND ON THE EASTERN SIDE, 
THEY ARE STRONGER. 
SO AREAS LIKE MARIANNA AND 
DALTON, WHERE THE STORM GOES 
RIGHT NEARBY, PROBABLY FINDS 
WEAKER WINDS THEN WE WILL SEE 
IN SOME AREAS NEAR BAINBRIDGE. 
WE WILL SEE WINS OVER 60 MILES 
PER HOUR. 
BUT THAT IS LIKELY ALL, EVEN IF 
THE CORE HAS STRONGER WINDS. 
THEY HAVE THE TRANSLATE DOWN 
FROM THE SURFACE. 
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO 
BE THE CASE. 
FURTHER REMOVED FROM THE GULF 
WATERS, IT WILL LOSE INTENSITY 
AND LIKELY IN A HURRY. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK. 
BACK TO THE NEWS DESK IN JUST A 
SECOND. 
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THE EXTENDED 
FORECAST. 
ALL WE TALK ABOUT IS MICHAEL, 
MICHAEL, MICHAEL. 
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE ARE 
LOOKING AT INTO THE UPCOMING 
WEEKEND. 
SOME ACTUAL FALL LIKE WEATHER, 
GUYS. 
THAT WILL MAKE THIS ALL SEEM A 
WHOLE LOT BETTER. 
>> PRETTY INCREDIBLE THERE, AS 
HE SAID. 
THE STORM HAS OFFICIALLY MADE 
LANDFALL AND THERE'S A LOT OF 
FOLKS IN OUR AREA RIGHT NOW 
THAT THEY ARE SO GLAD THEY HAD 
GOTTEN OUT OF THOSE EVACUATION 
AREAS AND INTO THOSE SHELTERS. 
>> IN LEON COUNTY, HIGH SCHOOL 
SERVING AS SHELTERS. 
ABBY WALDEN IS THERE. 
>> Reporter: A LITTLE HARD TO 
HEAR, AS YOU CAN TELL. 
I AM IN THE PET SIDE. 
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS PEOPLE WILL 
COME IN WITH THEIR PETS AND 
THEY WILL BE USHERED TO A 
SEPARATE BUILDING. 
THEY WILL REGISTERED WITH THE 
HUMANE SOCIETY, LEAVE THEIR 
PETS HERE, AND IF THEY NEED TO 
BE WALKED AND THAT SORT OF 
THING, THEY CAN COME AND DO 
THAT AS WELL. 
ANIMALS DEFINITELY FEELING THE 
EFFECTS OF HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT NOT ONLY 
ARE THERE DOGS AND CATS HERE, 
BUT THERE ARE ALSO PARROTS, 
AFFAIR, AND EVEN APPEARED. 
LOTS OF PEOPLE TAKING THE 
WARNING, BRINGING THEIR PETS 
HERE SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN STAY 
SAFE. 
>> THAT WAS PRETTY HARD TO 
HEAR, BUT PEOPLE BRING THEIR 
PETS. 
PETS ARE MEMBERS OF THEIR 
FAMILY, SO THEY WANT EVERYONE 
TO BE SAFE. 
>> THAT SOUNDED LIKE 1001 
DONATIONS -- DALMATIANS. 
>> Reporter: THE LIGHT INSIDE 
OF THE GYMNASIUM WENT OUT A 
LITTLE AFTER 12:30. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE STARTLED, 
BUT NOT FRANTIC. 
EVERYONE IS ROLLING WITH THE 
FLOW, AND THE LIGHTS ARE STILL 
ON IN THIS PART OF THE GYM. 
THIS IS THE LOBBY AREA. 
OF COURSE, OUTSIDE THERE'S A 
LOT OF PEOPLE HANGING OUT 
OUTSIDE, BUT THERE ARE ABOUT 
278 PEOPLE SIGNED UP AT THE 
SHELTER HERE. 
THAT WAS AS OF NOON. 
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF IT. 
THEY ARE WORKING ON THE LIGHTS 
SITUATION INSIDE THE GYM. 
IT SHOULD BE UP PRETTY SOON, 
BUT EVERYONE IS DOING WELL. 
THEY ARE DOING OKAY, NOT UPSET 
ABOUT ANYTHING. 
THEY ARE JUST GOING WITH IT. 
THEY ARE JUST GLAD TO BE HERE. 
BACK TO YOU IN THE STUDIO. 
>> THANK YOU. 
AS YOU HAVE SEEN, WE HAVE TEAM 
COVERAGE. 
OUR CREWS ARE ALL ACROSS NORTH 
FLORIDA, EVEN IN SOUTH GEORGIA 
KEEPING YOU UPDATED ON ALL YOU 
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE STORM. 
YOU CAN DOWNLOAD OUR PINPOINT 
WEATHER APP. 
OUR WEATHER TEAM HAS YOU 
COVERED. 
>> AND WE WOULD LIKE IF YOU

AND IF YOU CAN SAFELY DO IT, 
SUBMIT THOSE. 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO SHOW SOME OF 
THOSE PICTURES LATER ON. 
WE HAVE LOTS MORE COVERAGE JUST 
AHEAD. 
STAY WITH US. 
>>> AND WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE 
HURRICANE COVERAGE AHEAD. 
STICK WITH US. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS 
FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE. 
FLORENCE TURNED DEADLY. 
>> HIGH TIRE ROLLED IN. 
-- TIED ROLLED IN. 
>> THIS IS A MASSIVE OAK TREE 
THAT WAS TOPPLED. 
FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES, 
THEY ARE HOPING THEY WILL STILL 
HAVE HOMES TO RETURN TO. 
>> THIS IS THE WORST IT IS EVER 
BEEN. 
>> THIS IS GARY. 
>> THIS IS SOME OF THE WORST OF 
LAWRENCE -- SCARY. 
THIS IS SOME OF THE WORST OF 
FLORENCE. 
>>> WE WANT TO TEXAS TO 
INTERVIEW BOTH OF THE 
CANDIDATES. 
SENATOR CREWS IS A CONSERVATIVE 
ICON. 
>> A DEMOCRAT HASN'T WON A 
STATEWIDE RACE SINCE 1994. 
WINO -- WHY NOW? 
>> HAVE ANY U.S. INSPECTORS 
BEEN INSIDE NORTH KOREA? 
>>> HELLO, EVERYONE. 
I'M REENA NINAN.  
HURRICANE MICHAEL IS MID-LEVEL 
IN FLORIDA.  
CADDIS GORY -- THE CATEGORY 
FOUR IS  POUNDING THE AREA. 
OFFICIALS FEAR HURRICANE 
úMICHA 
TO EVER HIT FLORIDA PANHANDLE. 
WE HAVE LIFE TEAM COVERAGE ALL 
OVER -- LIVE TEAM COVERAGE ALL 
OVER THE AREA. 
WOULD TAKE YOU TO KEN GRAHAM 
WHO HAS THE LATEST. 
>> LET'S LOOK AT THE LATEST 
INFORMATION ON HURRICANE 
MICHAEL.  
IT MADE LANDFALL. 
PRESSURED 919 MILLIBARS. WINDS 
GET 115. A LOT OF DAMAGING 
WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. 
YOU CAN SEE THAT I WON'T MAKE 
AND ON LANDFALL. 
THE WIND WARNING IS ISSUED. 
THAT MEANS INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS 
SITUATIONS WITH THAT WIND. 
WE ALSO GOT A LOOK AT THE 
DIFFERENT AREAS AS WELL. 
THE TORNADO POSSIBILITY AND 
SOME OF THE HURRICANE FORCE 
GUSTS WITH THAT AS WELL. 
IS NOT JUST THE CENTER. IT IS 
WELL UP FROM THE CENTER. 
SOMETHING ELSE I WANT TO 
MENTION, IF YOU DIDN'T LEAVE 
AND THIS EYE COMES THROUGH, IT 
COULD MOMENTARILY GET CALM. 
REMEMBER, YOU HAVE THE OTHER 
SIDE COMING THROUGH. 
STAY SAFE. 
STATE SHELTERED. 
IT IS A VERY DANGEROUS 
SITUATION. 
WHERE IS IT GOING? 
LOOK AT THE SIZE AND THE SYSTEM.
LOOK AT THESE WINDS EXTENDING 
175 MILES AWAY FROM THE CENTER 
AND EVEN AROUND THE CENTER. 
WE REALLY NEED TO NOT FOCUS ON 
THAT CENTER. 
YOU NEED TO THINK OF THIS IS 
ALARM -- LARGE STORM. 
POWER OUTAGES BECAUSE OF THESE 
WINDS THAT COULD LAST SEVERAL 
WEEKS. 
IT IS A SERIOUS SITUATION. NOT 
JUST THE COAST. 
WE STILL EXPECT TRY NINE ON THAT
-- HURRICANE FORCE WIND  STATE 
LINE. 
IF YOU TAKE THE RAIN AND YOU 
TAKE THOSE WINDS, YOU CAN HAVE 
POWER OUTAGES AND TREES DOWN 
THROUGH GEORGIA AND PORTIONS OF 
SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND ALSO INTO 
THE CAROLINAS. 
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT RAIN, YOU 
CAN SEE ELANA FLASH FLOODING. 
IT'S A SERIOUS SITUATION. 
ANYTIME YOU OF THESE TROPICAL 
SYSTEMS COME IN, SIX TO 10 
INCHES OF RAIN UP INTO PORTIONS 
OF SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND EVEN 
INTO GEORGIA. 
LOOK AT THIS LARGE AREA FOUR TO 
SIX INCHES. 
THAT'S WHERE YOU WILL HAVE SOME 
OF THE WINDS IN SATURATED SOIL. 
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS EVEN 
INLAND. 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE 
STORM -- STORM SURGE. 
IT LOOKS LIKE WE ALREADY HAVE 
7.4 FEET INUNDATION IN 
APALACHICOLA. 
EVEN THOUGH THE SYSTEM  IS 
INLAND, YOU CAN STILL HAVE THAT 
ONSHORE FLOW PUSHING THAT WATER 
IN. 
JUST BECAUSE THE STORM IS 
INLAND, YOU'RE NOT OUT OF 
DANGER YET WHEN IT COMES TO 
STORM SURGE. 
WE CONTINUE TO FORECAST NINE TO 
14 FEET. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
THAT IS NINE FEET TO 14 FEET 
ABOVE GROUND. 
WAVES ON TOP OF IT. 
YOU CAN SEE THIS WATER COME IN. 
ON TOP, YOU STILL HAVE THE 
DAMAGING WAVES THAT CAN CAUSE 
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE AS WELL. 
YOU GET THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF 
STORM SURGE, EVEN FURTHER AWAY, 
WELL AWAY FROM THE CENTER, YOU 
ARE STILL NOT SAFE. 
YOU CAN SEE ELEVATED VALUES ALL 
THE WAY TO CEDAR KEY AND EVEN 
AS FAR AS TAMPA, TWO TO FOUR 
FEET. 
THAT IS NOT JUST THE COAST. 
YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THIS GOES 
INLAND AS THE WINDS CONTINUED 
TO PUSH THE WATER FURTHER 
INLAND. 
THIS HAS BEEN KEN GRAHAM WHAT 
THE VERY LATEST ON A POWERFUL 
HURRICANE MICHAEL.  
>> KEN GRAHAM, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
START FOR MORE ALSO ON PANAMA 
CITY , FLORIDA. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING -- 
>>> FOR MORE ALSO ON PANAMA 
CITY , FLORIDA. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? 
>> Reporter: WE HAVE RELEASING 
THE WIND AND THE RAIN PICK UP 
IN INTENSITY. 
ONE THING WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING 
IS THIS AUTOBODY SHOP HERE RAIN 
ACROSS THE WAY. 
ALREADY WE HAVE SEEN PARTS OF 
THE ROOF, OFF. YOU CAN SEE IT 
LOOKS LIKE -- I JUST GOT HIT 
WITH A BIG GUST OF WIND THERE. 
OF COURSE, WE ARE KEEPING AN 
EYE ON THE POWER LINES. 
YOU CAN PROBABLY SEE SOME THESE 
STORIES SWING BEHIND ME AND 
SOME OF THE BRANCHES ARE PRETTY 
LOOSE. 
FORECASTERS ARE WARNING THAT 
THE DAMAGE WE COULD SEE FROM 
THE STORM BEING A CATEGORY FOUR 
COULD BE CATASTROPHIC. 
>> I KNOW YOU ARE BRAVING THE 
ELEMENTS NOW BUT HOW ARE YOU 
AND THE CREW STAYING SAFE IN 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 
>> Reporter: WELL, WE WERE ON 
THE BEACH JUST YESTERDAY. 
OF COURSE, THINGS HAVE CHANGED 
OUT THERE AS WELL. 
BUT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE HUNKERED 
DOWN OUTSIDE OF A HOTEL. 
AND WE ARE TRYING TO SHIELD 
OURSELVES AS BEST AS WE CAN. 
EVEN WITH THE HOTEL, WE HAVE 
SEEN PIECES OF THE ROOF, OFF -- 
ROOF COME OFF OF THE HOTEL. 
WE ARE TRYING TO BE AS SAFE AS 
WE CAN. 
>> I SEE YOUR PRODUCER TRYING 
TO HELP YOU. 
I KNOW IT LOOKS PRETTY 
DANGEROUS OUT THERE. 
I HOPE YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF 
YOURSELF AND GET IN THERE. 
THAT IS NOT GOOD AT ALL. 
BEFORE YOU GO THOUGH, CAN YOU 
TELL US WHAT OFFICIALS ARE 
SAYING ABOUT THIS? 
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU KNOW, 
OBVIOUSLY WE DID TALK TO SOME 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, ACTUALLY THE 
POLICE CHIEF FOR PANAMA CITY 
BEACH . I WAS ASKING HIM ABOUT 
HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD EVACUATED 
BECAUSE LOCAL AUTHORITIES WERE 
REALLY CONCERNED -- I HAVE TO 
GET ON THE WAY FOR THE SECOND. 
>> THIS IS CRAZY. 
>> Reporter: I WILL KIND OF 
TALK THROUGH THIS. 
THE LOCAL CHIEF TOLD ME ABOUT 
50% OF PEOPLE EVACUATED ONCE 
THEY LEARNED ABOUT THE STRENGTH 
OF THE STORM. 
THAT WAS WHEN THEY FOUND OUT 
THERE WAS A CATEGORY TWO PARK 
-- TWO. 
THAT REALLY IS THE CONCERN NOT 
ONLY OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT 
THE GOVERNOR. 
WE HEARD HIM SAY EARLIER TO 
DATE THAT HE IS SCARED TO DEATH 
FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO 
WERE ON BARRIER ISLAND REFUSED 
TO EVACUATE. 
>> YES. 
BEFORE YOU GO, DO YOU KNOW 
ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO 
EVACUATED? 
DO OFFICIALS FEEL ENOUGH 
EVACUATED AND DID THEY GET THE 
HELP THEY NEEDED? 
>> Reporter: WHAT WE DO KNOW, 
AT LEAST YOUR LOCALLY IN PANAMA 
CITY BEACH,  THE CHIEF SAID 
THERE ARE NO TOURISTS HERE AND 
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE WENT HOME. 
IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE 
IN THE AREA, HE DIDN'T GIVE ME 
A SENSE AS TO WHERE THEY WENT 
BUT THEY DO HAVE SHELTERS THAT 
ARE SET UP IN THE AREA. 
THEY WERE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE 
WERE STILL TRYING TO RIDE THIS 
OUT AT HOME TO AT LEAST GET TO 
SHELTER. ULTIMATELY, THEY MADE 
THE CALL IN BAY COUNTY THAT 
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO SHELTER IN 
PLACE. 
SO AT THIS POINT, I WOULD 
EXPECT MOST PEOPLE ARE WRITING 
OUT THE STORM LIKE WE ARE. 
-- RIDING OUT THE STORM LIKE WE 
ARE. 
AND CONGRATULATIONS. 
WHAT A WAY TO START OFF A NEW 
CAREER. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS 
REPORT. 
I HOPE YOU CAN GET INSIDE AND 
STAY SAFE. 
>>> ON THE PHONE WITH US NOW IS 
DAVID. 
HE IS A REPORTER FROM THE MIAMI 
HERALD. 
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE SEEING, 
DAVID? 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
WE ARE IN A PARKING GARAGE. 
WE HAVE A BUNCH OF 
PHOTOGRAPHERS HERE AND A FEW 
OTHER PEOPLE. 
WE ARE JUST WATCHING THE 
AWESOME POWER OF NATURE 
BASICALLY JUST RUNNING THROUGH 
TREES, THE GUSTS, IT LOOKS LIKE 
AN A PUBLIC -- APOCALYPTIC 
SCENE OUT HERE. 
IT IS SORT OF WHAT YOU WOULD 
EXPECT WITH THE CATASTROPHIC 
WIND SPEED OF HURRICANE 
MICHAEL.  
THE DO YOU GET A SENSE, DAVID, 
THE PEOPLE EVACUATED OR DID 
THEY CHOOSE TO HUNKER DOWN? 
>> I THINK IT WAS BOTH. 
SURPRISINGLY, I DIDN'T GET A 
HUGE SENSE OF URGENCY FROM 
PEOPLE WHEN WE CAME. 
THIS IS A TOURIST TOWN SO A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WHO WERE TOURISTS LEFT
BUT WE INTERVIEWED QUITE A FEW 
PEOPLE WHO DECIDED TO STAY AND 
STAY ON THE BARRIER ISLAND SIDE 
AND WERE JUST GOING TO HUNKER 
DOWN AND TRY TO WITHSTAND IT. 
SO, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
DECIDING TO HANG ON SO THEY CAN 
BE CLOSE TO THEIR PROPERTIES. 
>> WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
SITUATION, DAVID, I KNOW COVER 
THE NEWS FOR THE MIAMI HERALD, 
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 
PREPARING FOR STORM LIKE THIS, 
DO YOU FEEL THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
BOARDED UP AND PROTECTED 
PROPERTY OR DID IT COME AS A 
SURPRISE TO MANY PEOPLE THAT IT 
HAPPENED SO QUICKLY? 
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT WE WERE A LITTLE MARVELED 
AT WHEN WE WERE DRIVING DOWN 
YESTERDAY AND DRIVING THROUGH 
PANAMA CITY  AND PANAMA CITY 
BEACH  WAS HOW FEW PLACES HAD 
SHUTTERS UP. IT DIDN'T SEEM -- 
IF YOU ARE DRIVING DOWN SOME OF 
THE MAIN STRIPS HERE, IT DIDN'T 
LOOK LIKE IT WAS ANY DIFFERENT 
THAN ANY OTHER NORMAL NIGHT. 
SO, IT WAS A LITTLE SURREAL. I 
THINK THAT IT CAUGHT A LOT OF 
PEOPLE OFF GUARD. 
THERE WAS A BIG RUN ON GASOLINE 
BUT THERE WERE STILL SOME 
PLACES WITH GASOLINE AND SOME 
PLACES WERE STILL OPEN SELLING 
A FEW THINGS. 
IT IS WEIRD. 
IT DEFINITELY CREPT UP ON 
PEOPLE BUT THAT IS NOT UNUSUAL 
WITH OCTOBER STORMS. 
>> DAVID, SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU 
COULD JOIN US. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I APPRECIATE IT. 
>>> JOINING US NOW FROM 
TALLAHASSEE IS MANUEL 
BOJORQUEZ.  
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT 
YOU'RE SEEING AT THIS POINT? 
>> Reporter: WE ARE IN DOWNTOWN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
THE TREES THAT THE CITY IS 
FAMOUS FOR IS STARTING TO TELL 
THE STORY. 
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE YOU GET A 
GOOD GUST COMING THROUGH. 
IT ALL GETS GOING. 
WE ARE GETTING REPORTS OF POWER 
OUTAGES IN THE TALLAHASSEE 
AREA. 
WAS SPOKE WITH THE POWER 
COMPANY EARLIER TODAY AND THEY 
TOLD US USUALLY THEY HAVE ABOUT 
120 PEOPLE WORKING. 
TODAY THEY HAVE 600 PEOPLE 
STANDING BY. 
THAT IS JUST THE MUNICIPAL 
COMPANY TRYING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THEY CAN KEEP THE LIGHTS 
ON. 
THERE ARE EXPECTED POWER 
OUTAGES TO BE HERE. 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 
ALTHOUGH THE MAJOR IMPACTS OF 
THE STORM RIGHT NOW ARE 
HAPPENING ALONG THE COAST, THE 
INLAND AIR AREAS -- AREAS ARE 
ALSO GOING TO GET THOSE 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS. 
WE WON'T BE STANDING BY THOSE 
TREES IN A FEW HOURS WHEN THAT 
HURRICANE COMES THROUGH HERE, 
EXPECTED TO BE IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON OR EVENING. 
SHELTERS ARE OPEN. 
WE ARE SEEING NOT MANY PEOPLE 
OUT AND ABOUT. THAT'S A VERY 
GOOD THING. 
AGAIN, THAT WIND IS STARTING TO 
PICK UP. 
PRETTY SOON IT WILL START TO BE 
CONSISTENT LIKE WE ARE SEEING 
FROM COLLEAGUES OUT ALONG THE 
COAST. 
>> THE REPORTS WE ARE SEEING 
AND THE IMAGES WE ARE SEEING 
ARE PRETTY TREMENDOUS. 
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING FOR THE 
POINT OF IMPACT? 
WHEN WILL IT REALLY TOUCHDOWN 
IN TALLAHASSEE? 
TRACK WHAT WE ARE SEEING -- 
>> Reporter: WHAT WE ARE 
HEARING SO FAR, CONDITIONS ARE 
REALLY GOING TO START TO 
DETERIORATE LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
WILL GO BACK TO THIS POINT THAT 
THE BIG CONCERN IS CLEARLY NOT 
GOING TO BE COASTAL FLOODING OR 
STORM SURGE. 
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS. 
SO MANY TREES HERE AND ANY OF 
THEM THAT ARE OLD OR DYING OR 
SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE THE 
HURRICANE FORCE WIND  S, THOSE 
ARE EXPECTED TO COME DOWN ON 
HOMES AND BUILDINGS. 
THERE WANTING TO GET PEOPLE 
INTO SHELTERS, AWAY FROM THE 
STORIES. 
ALSO THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO 
THE POWER OUTAGES THAT ARE 
EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THIS AREA. 
IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH LATE 
AFTERNOON TO EVENING FOR THE 
TALLAHASSEE AREA AND THAT IT 
MOVES ON OUT OF HERE. 
THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT 
DAMAGE IT LEFT BEHIND. 
WE SHOULD POINT OUT AS FAR AS 
POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE WINDS 
START TO GET CONSISTENT AT 
ABOUT 35 MILES PER HOUR AND WE 
MAY BE THERE SOON, THAT'S WHEN 
THE POWER COMPANY SAYS IT IS NO 
LONGER SAFE TO BE OUT AND ABOUT 
TRYING TO RESTORE THE POWER 
LINES THAT WERE KNOCKED DOWN 
EARLY ON. 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE DOING 
THAT ANYMORE. 
IT MAY NOT BE UNTIL TOMORROW 
WHEN THEY GET DAYLIGHT THAT 
THEY ARE FINALLY ABLE TO START 
CLEARING TREES AND TRYING TO 
RESTORE POWER. 
THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES WHEN IT 
COMES TO RESTORING POWER. 
THE HOSPITALS, NURSING HOMES, 
ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, 
THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY WILL 
TRY TO GET ONLINE FIRST FOR 
OBVIOUS REASONS. 
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 
THE POWER THE MOST AND THE MOST 
QUICKLY. 
IT'S GOING TO BE ROUGH GOING 
HERE IN TALLAHASSEE AS WERE 
STARTING TO SEE REPORTS FROM 
THE COAST AND A SLIGHTLY WEAKER 
OF HURRICANE MICHAEL  BEGINS TO 
MAKE ITS WAY HERE INTO THE 
CAPITAL. 
>> YOU LIVE IN MIAMI AND YOU 
KNOW ABOUT HURRICANE COVERAGE. 
I'M JUST CURIOUS. 
WHAT OF THE STORES LIKE? 
WHAT OF PEOPLE DONE TO PREPARE 
AT THIS POINT? 
WHAT PEOPLE ADVISE YOU TO DO 
WHEN YOU KNOW THIS IS COMING? 
>> Reporter: WE GOT HERE AND 
WHEN YOU LAND IN ONE OF THESE 
AREAS BEFORE DISASTER, YOU LOOK 
FOR WATER. IMMEDIATELY THE 
FIRST WALMART I WENT TO WAS OUT 
OF BREAD AND WATER. 
PEOPLE DID PREPARE. 
THERE WERE GAS LINES. 
WE ARE NOT SEEING MANY OF THOSE 
NOW. 
THAT'S BECAUSE A LOT OF THE 
STATIONS HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP 
UP THE PUMPS. 
AT THIS POINT, -- AND WE HAVE 
HEARD THE OFFICIALS SAY IT OVER 
AND OVER, IF YOU'RE NO LONGER 
PREPARED OR IF YOU'RE STILL 
TRYING TO PREPARE, I SHOULD SAY,
THE TIME IS REALLY UP. 
RIGHT NOW, IT IS JUST BRACE FOR 
IT. 
HUNKER DOWN AND GET ENDORSED TO 
THE INTER-MOST PART OF ANY 
BUILDING. 
YOU MENTIONED THE LESSONS 
LEARNED ESPECIALLY AFTER IRMA 
LAST YEAR. 
YOU'LL RECALL THERE WAS A 
HORRIBLE INCIDENT AT A NURSING 
HOME WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER 
THE POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOR 
DAYS. THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 
THE POWER BACK TO THE BUILDING. 
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 
GENERATOR. 
THERE IS A NEW LAW IN FLORIDA 
THAT IS AIMING TO PREVENT THAT 
KIND OF A TRAGEDY FROM 
HAPPENING AGAIN AND REQUIRING 
ALL NURSING HOMES AND ASSISTED 
LIVING FACILITIES TO HAVE A 
GENERATOR. 
BUT AFTER THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 
1, NUMBERS SHOW THAT A LOT OF 
THOSE FACILITIES -- ESPECIALLY 
IN THIS AREA, DO NOT HAVE THOSE 
INSTALLED YET FOR MANY REASONS. 
THERE IS A LABOR SHORTAGE AND 
ALSO A SHORTAGE OF SUPPLIES. 
BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO PROVE 
THEY CAN KEEP PEOPLE SAFE. 
THAT'S SOMETHING THE STATE IS 
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY INTO. 
THAT'S WHY THE POWER COMPANIES 
LOOKING TO WRITE OUR TIES -- TO 
PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS. 
YOU CAN SEE THE TREES REALLY 
ARE GETTING GOING. 
THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW IT IS 
STARTING TO BECOME MORE 
CONSISTENT. 
IS NO LONGER ONCE EVERY 10 
MINUTES. 
IT IS STARTING TO BE A REGULAR 
FLOW THROUGH HERE. 
CLEARLY, MICHAEL IS GETTING 
CLOSER. 
INTERESTING YOU CAN PREDICT THAT
BY LOOKING AT THE TREES. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
STAY SAFE. 
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SPOKE 
WITH FEMA ADMINISTRATOR BROCK 
LONG AND KIRSTJEN NIELSEN ABOUT 
 
HURRICANE MICHAEL.  
HERE'S WHAT HE HAD TO SAY ABOUT 
THE EVACUATIONS. 
>> DEPENDING WHAT HAPPENS HERE 
-- THEY ARE ALL EITHER CONTACTED
OR IN THE PROCESS. I HAD A LONG 
TALK WITH RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA.
VERY WELL COORDINATED WITH ALL 
OF THE STATES. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MUST BE 
SAID IS IT IS NOT SO EASY FOR 
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TO LEAVE. 
SOME OF THE AREAS ARE VERY 
POOR. 
IT IS NOT EASY FOR A PERSON 
WITHOUT THE NECESSARY MONEY TO 
LEAVE. 
SO WHAT WE HAVE DONE SENT BUSES 
AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- WE 
ARE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
THINGS TO TRY TO REMOVE PEOPLE 
FROM THE AREA. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY POOR 
IN THOSE AREAS. 
IT IS VERY TOUGH FOR THEM TO 
LEAVE. 
THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS YOU 
ARE FINDING. 
>> YES. 
IN SOME CASES, WHAT WE ASK TO 
DO ON BLUE SKY DAYS IS AS 
PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE 
MEANS OR MECHANISMS TO GET OUT 
TO REGISTER WITH LOCAL AGENCIES
. FLORIDA HAS BEEN PRETTY 
ROBUST IN DOING THAT. 
AND WE DO WHAT WE CAN TO BE 
ABLE TO SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT OF 
PEOPLE. 
WHEN IT COMES TO GEORGIA, WE 
ARE NOT EVACUATING FOR STORM 
SURGE IN GEORGIA. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE HIGH WINDS. 
WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO GET IN 
FACILITY THAT CAN WITHSTAND 
THOSE WINDS. 
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE SIZE AND 
HOW LONG IT IS, TAKE A LOOK AT 
THAT AND THE RED AREA. 
THAT'S THE AREA WHERE IT WILL 
HIT PRETTY HEAVILY. 
THAT'S A LOT OF SURE. 
IT'S A LOT OF LAND -- LOT OF 
SHORE. 
THAT'S A LOT OF LAND. 
>> IT'S ALMOST THE ENTIRE SIZE 
OF THE GOLF. 
THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT -- THE 
GULF. THEY HAVEN'T SEEN THAT 
BEFORE. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR MICHAEL. 
WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.  
ALWAYS ON.
STRICT HURRICANE MICHAEL HAS 
MADE  LANDFALL IN FLORIDA. 
THE STORM IS DAMNING -- 
SLAMMING PANAMA CITY. 
STORM SURGE IS THE GREATEST 
THREAT. 
WATER COULD RISE 14 FEET. 
PRESIDEN TRUMP STRESSED IT IS 
TOO LATE TO EVACUATE. 
THE HEAD OF FEMA SAYS 
OPERATIONS WILL BEGIN AFTER THE 
WORST OF THE STORM CLEARS. 
>> WE HAVE TEAMS NOT ONLY WITH 
AND EMBEDDED WITH THE STAFF AND 
SOME OF THE LOCAL COUNTY 
EMERGENCY MANAGERS BUT WE HAVE 
EQUIPMENT IN TEAMS STAYS IN 
MAXALT TO ORLANDO -- MAXWELL TO 
ORLANDO. 
>> DAVID PARKINSON JOINS US NOW.
DAVID, WHAT'S THE LATEST? 
>> THE STORM IS MED LANDFALL. 
-- MADE LANDFALL. 
IT CONTINUES TO LOOK FAIRLY 
HEALTHY. 
STORMS ARE SUPPOSED TO DO GREAT 
BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE KEEPING 
ITS ACT TOGETHER. 
WE ARE ONTO PART TWO OF THE 
STORM WHAT SHALL BE THE INLAND 
IMPACTS. 
THE STORM SURGE IS STILL RISING 
IN PLACES. 
WHAT IF YOU ARE IN PANAMA CITY 
OR PANAMA CITY BEACH,  YOU HAVE 
ANOTHER HOUR OR SO OF THE EYE 
WALL TO GOOD DEAL WITH. 
-- TO DEAL WITH. 
THIS IS JUST WHAT WAS RECORDED 
BY ANEMOMETER'S THAT HAVE A 
BROKEN. 
THIS SHOULD GIVE YOU AN 
INDICATION OF HOW SERIOUS THIS 
IS. 
THERE IS NO EVACUATING. 
WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS 
AND WILL BE FOR THE NEXT 
SEVERAL HOURS. 
>> WALK ME THROUGH THE NEXT 
SEVERAL HOURS. 
WHO WAS AT RISK? 
>> WE ARE LOOKING ALONG THE I-
10 AREA FROM PANAMA CITY TO I-
10.  
THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE 
WINDS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
HOURS. 
BEYOND THAT, WE ARE LOOK AT 
SERIOUS WIND GUST, APPROACHING 
100 MILES PER HOUR IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
AND THEN INTO SOUTHWESTERN 
GEORGIA AS WELL. 
IT IS POSSIBLE THIS DAYS AS A 
CATEGORY TWO INTO GEORGIA UP 
ALMOST TOWARDS BACON -- MACON. 
THEN IT WILL BE INLAND FROM 
CHARLESTON AND SAVANNAH. 
THEY'LL BE GETTING STORM SURGE 
AND WINS IN THE 50s AND 60s. 
-- WINDS INTO THE 50s AND 60s. 
FOR TOMORROW, WE ARE LOOKING AT 
THE STORM CONTINUING TO MAKE 
ITS WAY NORTH. 
THAT WOULD BE INTO THE 
CAROLINAS AND PLACES WHERE THEY 
SCARCELY NEED MORE RAIN AFTER 
HURRICANE FLORENCE. 
THEY COULD BE SEEING ANOTHER 
THREE, FOUR, SIX, EIGHT INCHES 
DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE. 
SOME OF THE RIVER STILL HAVEN'T 
COME DOWN. 
BY FRIDAY MORNING, THIS IS OFF 
THE COAST ALREADY AND IT 
BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL. 
WE COULD BE SEEING SOME GUSTS 
IN NEW YORK BUT ONCE THE STORM 
MAKES IT PAST NORFORK, THE 
DANGER IS FOR THE MOST PART 
DONE. 
BY NO MEANS IS THAT THREAT DONE 
IN THE INLAND AREAS. 
>> THEY ARE SAYING MICHAEL 
COULD BE ONE OF THE HEARSE TO 
HIT THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE EVER. 
YES. 
IT ALREADY HAS. 
LET'S BREAK IT DOWN 
CHRONOLOGICALLY. 
SINCE 1960, WE'VE ONLY HAD TWO 
STORMS MAKE LANDFALL WITH 
HIGHER WIND SPEEDS. 
THAT WOULD BE CAMILLE AND 
ANDREW. 
WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE WITH THE 
STRONGER CENTRAL PRESSURE. 
THAT'S CAMILLE. 
IN TERMS OF THE DEEPNESS OF THE 
CENTRAL PRESSURE, IT IS 
STRONGER THAN AND YOUR. 
THAT SHOULD SHOW YOU -- ANDREW. 
THAT SHOULD SHOW YOU HOW STRONG 
THIS IS. 
THE DEVASTATION IN TERMS OF 
ROOFS AND CARS TOPPLED OVER, WE 
CAN SEE THAT QUICKLY. 
WE MIGHT EVEN SEE SOME OF THE 
FIRST PICTURES BEFORE THE NIGHT 
TONIGHT BUT BY NO MEANS SHOULD 
YOU BE GOING OUT TO SURVEY HER 
LOOK UNTIL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT 
-- OR LOOK UNTIL EMERGENCY 
MANAGEMENT SAYS IT IS OKAY. 
I'M WATCHING WHEN IS THIS GOING 
TO FINALLY GET WEAKER? 
HURRICANE MICHAEL  WAS 
INTENSIFYING ALL THE WAY UP TO 
LANDFALL. 
HONESTLY, IT WOULD'VE MADE IT 
TO CATEGORY 5 IF IT HAD ANOTHER 
HOUR. 
HOW FAR INLAND DO WE SEE THOSE 
WINDS INTO THE 60s, 70s, 80s, 
90s, 100S. 
WE ARE GOING TO BE REALLY SEEING
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF POWER 
OUTAGES. 
YOU WILL BE SEEING PEOPLE 
WITHOUT POWER FOR DAYS AND IN 
TWO WEEKS. 
THERE IS GOING TO BE SO MANY 
TREES DOWN. 
THEY ARE VERY TALL AND THEY 
HAVE LARGE CANOPIES AND THEY 
ARE EASILY WEIGHTED DOWN. 
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG 
CLEANUP. 
INLAND NOT TO MENTION AT THE 
COAST IN MEXICO BEACH AND 
PANAMA CITY AND  PANAMA CITY 
BEACH  WHERE SOME OF THE 
HEAVIEST DAMAGE IS OCCURRING. 
WE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. 
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. 
>>> WE WANT TO RETURN YOU KNOW 
FROM -- NOW TO COVERAGE FROM 
WCTV. 
>>> YOU CAN WATCH THIS PATH.  
NOTICE HOW IT KEPT MOVING 
TOWARDS THE NURSE. 
IT STARTED TO GET THE IMPACTS 
OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 
THAT IS A HUGE PLAYER NOT ONLY 
IN THE DIRECTION OF MICHAEL BUT 
ALSO THE SPEED OF MICHAEL. 
IT WAS PLAYING A HUGE PART INTO 
THE FORECAST -- IF THERE IS ANY 
GOOD NEWS IN THIS, IT'S THAT 
WE'LL START TO SEE MUCH DRIER 
AIR COMING IN BY TOMORROW AND 
ESPECIALLY INTO FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY A LOT OF YOU THAT WILL 
BE WITHOUT POWER THE 
TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE WARM 
AND IT WILL STILL BE HUMID. 
THAT'S WHEN WE'LL BE 
TRANSITIONING. 
BY THE TIME WE GET TO TOMORROW 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING WE'LL 
BE TALKING ABOUT LOWS IN THE 
LOW TO MID 60s. 
AT LEAST IT WILL BE A LITTLE 
MORE COMFORTABLE AND EVEN SOME 
50 SATURDAY MORNING. 
A LOT MORE SUNSHINE AROUND AND 
DRIER AIR. 
THIS WILL LIKELY COME AS A MOVE 
TOWARDS LATE TONIGHT AND REALLY 
OVERNIGHT WHEN THE RAIN STARTS 
TO DEPART. 
LET'S LOOK AT THE RADAR. 
THIS IS A LIVE IMAGE LOOKING 
TOWARDS THE COAST. 
YOU CAN SEE THE CENTER OF 
MICHAEL -- YOU CAN SEE THE 
HEAVY RAINFALL STRETCHED OUT. 
IT SEEMS TO BE CONFINED. 
IT STOPS PRETTY MUCH OVER THE 
EASTERN PARTS OF ECHOLS AND 
SUWANEE COUNTIES. 
THE MOST INTENSE AREAS WITHIN 
ROUGHLY 50 MILES OF THE CENTER. 
THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE MUCH 
HIGHER RAINFALL RATES. 
IT IS SO HEAVY IT IS LIKE 
POURING A BUCKET OF WATER INTO 
THE RAIN GAUGE. 
THEY CAN'T KEEP UP. 
WE COULD EASILY SEE FOUR TO 
EIGHT OR EVEN EIGHT TO 12 
INCHES. 
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE 
THOSE KINDS OF TOTALS EVEN 
THOUGH IT IS A FAST-MOVING 
SYSTEM. 
HERE'S A CLOSER VIEW. 
CLEARLY IF YOU ARE WATCHING US 
IN CALHOUN COUNTY OR SSI I 
CONTINUES TO MOVE TO THE 
NORTHEAST -- AS THIS EYE 
CONTINUS TO MOVE TO THE 
NORTHEAST, IT WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE AN EYE. 
KEEP IN MIND WHILE IT WILL BE 
GETTING WEAKER, YOU'RE GOING TO 
GO FROM INTENSE WINDS AND THEN 
GO NEARLY CALM. 
DO NO GO OUT WHEN THE EYE 
PASSES OVER. 
I KNOW IT IS TEMPTING. 
IT WILL START TO FILL IN SEE 
PROBABLY WON'T SEE THE SUNSHINE 
BREAKING THROUGH. 
THERE IS A STILL A CHANCE YOU 
COULD ACTUALLY SEE BLUE SKY AND 
SUNSHINE ABOVE. 
IT WON'T BE AS SPECTACULAR TO 
SEE BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE MOST 
INTENSE WINDS MAY START TO GO 
AWAY AND MAKE IT NEARLY CALM. 
BUT THEN THE BACKSIDE HAS THE 
SAME LEVEL OF INTENSE WIND. 
IT WILL COME QUICKLY. 
I KNOW IT IS TEMPTING TO 
VENTURE OUT BUT JUST DON'T DO 
IT. 
IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE 
WINDOW, THAT'S FINE. 
AND THEN WE START TO SEE THE 
BREEZE PICKING BACK UP, GET 
AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS AGAIN. 
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO SEE THOSE 
WINDS THAT COULD EXCEED 100 
MILES PER HOUR IN GUS. 
IT WILL GET WEAKER QUICKLY AS 
IT MOVES INTO JACKSON AND 
DECATUR COUNTIES. 
WIND GUST IN EXCESS OF 75 MILES 
PER HOUR ARE LIKELY. 
PUT THIS INTO MOTION, THERE IS 
THE CLASSIC COUNTERCLOCKWISE 
MOVEMENT. 
STILL SEEING SOME LIGHTNING 
AROUND THE CORE AND THE EYE 
WALL. 
IT SHOWS INCREDIBLY INTENSE 
RAINFALL RATES COMING OUT OF 
THAT. 
THE FLASH FLOODING IS GOING 
ALONG WITH THAT. 
IT IS BLINDING RAIN ALONG WITH 
WINDS THAT ARE 100 MILES PER 
HOUR. 
THIS IS WHAT A MAJOR HURRICANE 
LOOKS LIKE. 
ONCE YOU GET BEYOND 50 MILES OR 
SO FROM THAT CENTER WHEN WE 
START TO SEE MORE REASONABLE 
WINDS. 
I HATE TO USE THAT TERM BECAUSE 
IT SOUNDS TOO NICE BUT AT LEAST 
THEY AREN'T IN THAT 70 TO 80 
MILE PER HOUR RANGE. 
THE RAINFALL FOR ALL OF THE 
VIEWING AREA, IT IS CERTAINLY 
LIGHTER TOWARDS THE EAST. 
WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR TORNADOES. 
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY STRONG 
ROTATIONS BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO 
WATCH THESE. 
THESE ARE OFFSHORE FROM FRANKLIN
COUNTY TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST 
AND BACK TOWARDS THE NORTH. 
ALSO THESE BINS THROUGH TAYLOR 
COUNTY AND EVEN THE ONES 
WITHOUT HERE TOWARDS THE EAST 
FROM NEAR CEDAR KEY AND THE 
SUWANEE RIVER VALLEY. 
THESE NEED TO BE WATCHED 
CLOSELY. 
IT'S ANOTHER GOOD REASON YOU 
SHOULD BE IN A SAFE PLACE. 
MANY TIMES THESE TYPES OF 
TORNADOES AREN'T YOUR CLASSIC, 
-- THERE IS ONE YOU CONTRACT. 
IT'S EMBEDDED WITH THIS. 
WHILE WE ARE TRYING TO MONITOR 
IT AND THE NATIONAL WEATHER 
SERVICE IS DOING A GREAT JOB 
AND ALERTING US -- WE DON'T 
ISSUE THE WARNINGS. 
THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE 
DOES. 
THEN WE PASS THEM ALONG. 
SOME OF THESE HAPPEN VERY, VERY 
QUICKLY. 
IT CAN DEVELOP IN A MINUTE OR 
TWO AND THEN GO AWAY IN A 
MINUTE OR TWO. 
WE'LL WATCH THAT. 
TYPICALLY, YOU SEE THEM OUT 
OVER THE WATER ROTATING GIVES 
YOU A LITTLE LEAD TIME. 
BUT JUST BE READY TO MOVE TO A 
SAFE PLACE OVER EASTERN AREAS. 
YOU SHOULD ALREADY BE IN A SAFE 
PLACE IF YOU ARE IN THE WESTERN 
HALF OF THE AREA. 
I PLOTTED THIS JUST BEFORE HE 
STARTED SO SOME NUMBERS HAVE 
PROBABLY CHANGED. 
I KNOW IT IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
COLORS. 
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE WIND 
VELOCITIES. 
I JUST PLOTTED SAMPLING TO SHOW 
YOU -- GRANTED FROM THE RADAR, 
THIS IS SHOOTING UP. 
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT ELEVATED. 
WERE NOT LIKELY SEEING THESE 
WINDS AT THE SURFACE BUT 
PERHAPS NOT TOO FAR FROM THAT. 
WHERE I SAMPLED THIS, IT SHOWED 
WINDS OF 72 MILES PER HOUR. 
WHERE I LOOKED AT THIS OVER 
CALHOUN COUNTY, IT SHOWED 94 
MILES PER HOUR. 
GOVE COUNTY, 83 MILES PER HOUR. 
ON THE EYE WALL SIDE, OVER INTO 
BAY COUNTY, 114 MILES PER HOUR. 
SO CLEARLY, THE RADAR IS 
SHOWING WE HAVE THESE WINDS. 
REMEMBER, THOSE INTENSE STORMS 
THAT I SHOWED YOU IN THE EYE 
WALL, THOSE ARE DOWN DRAFTS. 
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME OF 
THAT WIND AND FORCE IT DOWN 
TOWARDS THE SURFACE. 
THOSE ARE LIKELY THE TYPES OF 
CONDITIONS THAT CAUSE THE 129 
GUST THAT WE SAW. 
THE INTENSE STORMS WITH THE EYE 
WALL AND THE WINDS AT THE 
SURFACE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
INITIALLY THAT STRONG BUT ONCE 
CAME ALONG, IT FORCED THE 
STRONGER WINDS DOWN TOWARDS THE 
SURFACE. 
THIS IS VERIFICATION USING 
RADAR. 
WE ARE SEEING WINDS THAT ARE 
EXCEEDING HURRICANE FORCE. 
LET'S WIDEN OUT ENJOY THE 
SATELLITE VIEW. 
THAT'S ANOTHER GREAT WAY TO SEE 
THE EYE WALL. 
THIS IS JUST TO THE NORTHWEST 
OF MEXICO BEACH JUST BEFORE 
2:00. 
155 MILE PER HOUR WINDS. 
TO KEEP SUCH A SHY OF BEING A 
CATEGORY 5. HOPEFULLY, THERE IS 
NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO AT THIS 
POINT. IF YOU'RE AT THE COAST 
AND HE DECIDED TO STAY, WE ARE 
EXPECTING THE SEARCH TO REACH 
EIGHT TO 12 FEET. 
IF THERE IS ANY KIND OF 
POSITIVE NEWS, IT MADE LANDFALL 
ROUGHLY OVER HERE AND THAT 
COULD BE ENOUGH OF A DIFFERENCE 
COMPARED TO KEEP SAN BLAS OR 
APALACHICOLA , THE STRONGEST 
WATER WATER BEEN DRIVEN INTO 
FRANKLIN AND JEFFERSON AND 
TAYLOR COUNTIES. 
WE ARE GETTING CLOSE TO HIGH 
TIDE OUT. 
THE SURGE HEIGHT STILL -- THIS 
ISN'T GOING TO GET BETTER HERE 
UNTIL WE GET TO TONIGHT WHEN 
THE CIRCULATION MOVES INLAND 
AND THE WINDS CHANGE DIRECTION. 
THESE ARE THE SUSTAINED WINDS 
AS MEASURED ACROSS THE VIEWING 
AREA. 
FROM 26 MILES PER HOUR IN 
MARIANNA TO 33 IN TALLAHASSEE. 
IS NOT A BIG DEAL. THE 
SUSTAINED WINDS RIGHT NOW -- 
ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN HALF ARE 
NOT A BIG DEAL. 
BUT THERE WILL BE SOME GAS AND 
THERE'S THE THREAT FOR SEVERE 
WEATHER. 
DON'T PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN. 
-- GUSTS AND THERE'S THE THREAT 
FOR SEVERE WEATHER. 
DON'T PUT YOUR GUARD DOWN. 
AT TIMES THEY'VE EXCEEDED 60. 
IF YOU LOOK AT PANAMA CITY, 
SUSTAINED WIND AT 46.  
THESE ARE A ONE MINUTE AVERAGE. 
NOW WE LOOK AT THE GUSTS. 
I DID SEE ONE EARLIER 56. 
NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE 
WINDS CONTINUING TO GUST IN 
APALACHICOLA UP TO 84. 
66 IN PANAMA CITY.  
THERE AREN'T A LOT OF STATIONS 
IN THIS AREA. 
THERE ARE JUST A COUPLE 
UNOFFICIAL STATIONS THAT WE'RE 
TRYING TO MONITOR. 
YOU'RE GETTING A GOOD IDEA OF 
THE WIND FIELD AND HOW IT IS 
CONCENTRATED HERE WITH THE 
STRONGEST WINDS AND THEN IT 
DROPS OFF TO A MODERATE LEVEL, 
MODERATELY SEVERE IF IT WILL. 
AND THEN IT DROPS OFF TO PLAIN 
OLD WINDY CONDITIONS THE 
FURTHER EAST YOU GO. 
SINCE IT IS MOVING TOWARDS THE 
NORTHEAST, THESE STRONG WINDS 
-- THEY'LL BE GETTING WEAKER, 
BUT THEY ARE MOVING INTO PARTS 
OF SOUTHWEST GEORGIA. 
FROM BAKER TO MITCHELL DOWN TO 
GRADY AND DECATUR, YOU NEED TO 
PREPARE FOR THAT POSSIBILITY OF 
EXCEEDING 75 MILES PER HOUR AT 
LEAST. IN FACT, HERE IS FUTURE 
CAST. 
IT STARTS IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR 
SO AND KEEPS THAT CORE OF WINDS 
HERE. 
AS WE MOVE AHEAD, WE GET TO 
DINNERTIME OR SO AND WE ARE 
STARTING TO SEE THAT CORE OF 50 
TO 60 MILE-PER-HOUR. 
THESE ARE THE SUSTAINED WINDS. 
THIS IS JUST ONE FORECAST BUT 
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. 
NOTICE THE SHIFT IN DIRECTION 
TOO. 
IT IS STILL COMING FROM THE 
SOUTH. 
NOW WE ARE STARTING TO SEE 
APALACHICOLA WITH WINDS  
STRTING TO DIE DOWN A BIT. 
MOVE AHEAD A LITTLE MORE IN 
TIME AND WE'RE LOOKING AT 
OVERNIGHT. 
STILL WINDY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
PARTS OF THE AREA. 
SUSTAINED WINDS IN 30 TO 40 
MILE-PER-HOUR RANGE. 
THAT IS STILL TROPICAL STORM 
FORCE WINDS. 
IT IS STILL BREEZY. 
IS NOT SUDDENLY CALM. 
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNTIL 
TOMORROW OR TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 
THIS IS A BIG, HUGE, POWERFUL 
SYSTEM. 
AS WE CONTINUE TO GO INTO 
TOMORROW MORNING, NOW WE START 
TO SEE THAT RELAXATION IN THE 
WINDS AND COMING MORE FROM THE 
WEST. 
YOU NOTICE TOO WHILE THEY HAVE 
STARTED TO SLACK OFF, ONSHORE 
FLOW IS STILL THERE. 
IT'S A LIGHT SOUTHWEST WIND 
RELATIVELY SPEAKING BUT THE 
WATER WILL TAKE A WHILE TO 
RESEED OVER TAYLOR COUNTY. 
IT BECOMES MORE OF AN OFFSHORE 
WIND FOR FRANKLIN COUNTY IN 
PARALLEL TO THE COAST, THEY 
WILL GET LATER BUT IT WILL KEEP 
THE WATER IN PLACE LONGER IN 
TAYLOR COUNTY THEN PERHAPS 
OTHER AREAS. 
IT IS NOT JUST GOING TO -- 
>> YOU BEEN LISTENING TO 
COVERAGE FROM TALLAHASSEE. 
WANT TO CHECK IN WITH TEAMS ON 
THE GROUND. 
NICOLE JOINS US NOW. 
EARLIER YOUR CREW WAS WORKING 
HARD TO KEEP UP THE GEAR. 
WE SEE FROM YOU LIVE SHOT, 
THOSE TREES ARE BLOWING IN THE 
WIND. 
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 
EXPERIENCING NOW. 
>> Reporter: AT THIS POINT, WE 
HAVE TAKEN SHELTER. WE HAD TO 
COME IN BECAUSE AT THAT POINT, 
THE STORM WAS MAKING LANDFALL. 
THE RAIN AND THE WIND REALLY 
GOT VERY INTENSE. 
THAT TRADITIONAL CLASSIC SOUND 
OF A TRAIN THAT YOU HEAR WITH 
THE STRONG WINDS GUSTING 
THROUGH. 
SO WE HAVE KIND OF BEEN HANGING 
OUT, IF YOU WILL. 
WE HAVE LOST POWER, EVEN SOME 
PARTS OF THE HOTEL ARE STARTING 
TO COME APART AS WELL. 
CEILING TILES HAVE COME DOWN. 
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME LEAKS 
COMING FROM THE CEILING. 
THERE ARE OTHER MEDIA HERE AS 
WELL. 
EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO NAVIGATE 
THE SITUATION AS BEST WE CAN. 
IT DOES APPEAR THAT SOME OF THE 
WINDS HAVE STARTED TO DIE DOWN. 
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU'LL 
HAVE TO TAKE SHELTER AT THIS 
POINT? 
>> I WOULD THINK FOR THE NEXT 
HOUR OR TWO. 
THERE IS STILL DEBRIS BLOWING 
AROUND OUT THERE. 
IN FACT, WHERE WE WORK WE JUST 
SAW -- AS I MENTIONED, A WALL 
OF WATER COMING THROUGH. 
SOME OF THAT HAS RECEDED BUT 
AGAIN, I'M LOOKING RIGHT NOW AT 
ALL TYPES OF DEBRIS THAT IS ON 
THE GROUND. 
PIECES OF TREES, PIECES OF -- 
SMALL, LARGE, ALL SIZES. 
AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY WE'LL HAVE TO 
MAKE A DETERMINED TATIAN -- 
DETERMINATION AS THINGS 
PROGRESS. 
>> YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE PIECES 
OF THE HOTEL. 
WHAT IS BEEN THE CONCERN WHEN 
YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS IN THAT 
AREA? 
WHAT'S THE BIG CONCERN? 
>> THE MAIN CONCERN THAT THE 
LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES HAD 
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO CHOSE TO STAY
AND DIDN'T EVACUATE AND THERE 
HAVE BEEN SHELTERS THAT HAVE 
AND SET UP FOR THOSE PEOPLE, 
THEY ARE CLEARLY PEOPLE WHO 
DIDN'T HEED THE WARNINGS. RIGHT 
BEFORE THINGS REALLY PICKED UP, 
WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK 
WITH THE POLICE CHIEF OF PANAMA 
CITY BEACH. 
HE SAID I CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO 
LEAVE THEIR HOMES. 
AT A CERTAIN POINT , HE HAS TO 
PROTECT HIS OWN FORCE. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> WE DID SEE LOCAL AUTHORITIES 
SAY AT A CERTAIN POINT, WE MAY 
NOT BE ABLE TO COME AND SAVE 
YOU. 
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR 
CONVEYED AS WELL. 
>> UNFORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR 
HAS A GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE 
DEALING WITH HURRICANES AND 
GETTING THE WORD OUT. 
WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING OVER 
THE LAST FEW HOURS? 
>> Reporter: WELL, HE HAS BEEN 
TRYING TO EMPHASIZE HOW SERIOUS 
THIS IS AND HOW SERIOUS PEOPLE 
SHOULD TAKE THIS. 
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A STORM -- 
THE MAGNITUDE IS ONE THAT THIS 
PART OF FLORIDA HASN'T SEEN OR 
EXPERIENCED IN AT LEAST A 
CENTURY. 
HE MADE THAT CLEAR. 
AND I THINK WHAT SURPRISED US 
ALL IS THE INTENSITY OF THE 
STORM. 
THIS CAME ASHORE AT 155 MILES 
PER HOUR. 
THAT'S JUST SHY OF A CATEGORY 5.
TO WATCH HOW RAPIDLY IT PICKED 
UP IN STRENGTH, I THINK IT IS 
REMARKABLE. 
>> WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE? 
AS WE'RE WATCHING WE SAW THE 
CAMERA GEAR MOVING AROUND. 
HOW DID IT DETERIORATE TO FORCE 
YOU TO SEEK SHELTER INSIDE OF 
THE HOTEL? 
>> Reporter: AGAIN, THIS WAS AT 
THE CLIMAX OF THE STORM, RIGHT 
AS IT WAS COMING ASHORE AND 
MAKING LANDFALL. 
THAT'S WHERE THE STRONGEST 
WINDS ARE. 
IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO 
STAND. 
WE CONTINUED TO SEE -- DURING 
THE SHOT, WE POINTED OUT A ROOF 
THAT WAS COMING APART AT A SHOP.
BEING OUT IN THOSE CONDITIONS, 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BE 
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. 
THAT'S WHY WE MADE THE CALL 
THAT EVEN AS SOON AS WE CAME IN 
AND BROUGHT THE GEAR IN, THE 
DOOR LEADING OUTSIDE KEPT 
BLOWING OPEN. 
IT LITERALLY TOOK OUR CREW AND 
THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE MANNING 
THE HOTEL TO TIE THE DOOR DOWN 
AND KEEP IT SHUT. 
WE WERE THINKING WE WERE 
SEEKING SHELTER ONE REALLY WE 
WERE ONCE AGAIN EXPOSED TO MORE 
RISK. 
INCREDIBLE. 
NICOLE KILLIAN, I'M GLAD YOU 
ARE SAFE. 
THANK YOU. 
>> YOU ARE WELCOME. 
>>> I WANT TO BRING IN OMAR 
VILLAFRANCA. 
HE JOINS US FROM PORT ST. JOE 
IN FLORIDA. 
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 
EXPERIENCING. 
>> Reporter: RIGHT NOW WE ARE 
STARTING TO GET ON THE BACKSIDE 
OF THE BANDS OF HURRICANE 
MICHAEL.  
WE SAW PLENTY OF WIND AS THE 
SYSTEM WAS MOVING ON TO SHORE. 
WE SAW TOLD -- TALL PINE TREES 
THAT WERE BENDING OVER 
SIDEWAYS. 
WE SAW TREES SNAP AND PIECES OF 
BUILDINGS COMING OFF. 
THE POWER IS OUT IN THIS AREA. 
THAT'S GOING TO BE OBVIOUSLY 
SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO DEAL WITH. 
AND MAYBE EVEN LONGER. 
STORM SURGE IS ALWAYS THE BIG 
CONCERN. 
PEOPLE ARE STAYING OFF THE 
ROADS. 
THAT'S A GOOD NEWS. 
THE BAD NEWS IS THE STORM SURGE 
CAME WITH FURY. 
WE SOUGHT WATER ON THE ROAD 
THAT WAS A FEW INCHES RISE UP 
TO ALMOST 2 FEET. IT WAS MOVING 
VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 
WE LITERALLY PARKED TO GET SOME 
SHOTS OF VIDEO AND IT WAS 
RISING UP VERY FAST. 
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 
HUNKERED DOWN. 
THERE WAS AN EVACUATION ORDER 
IN THE AREA. 
THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAY 
ABOUT 60% -- MORE THAN HALF OF 
THE PEOPLE HERE BASICALLY ARE 
GATHERING SUPPLIES AND WERE 
HUNKERING DOWN. 
THERE IS A SMALL LITTLE HOTEL 
AROUND HERE. 
THE PARKING LOT IS PACKED. IT 
IS A LOT OF LOCALS WHO WERE AT 
VACATION HOMES OR HOMES NEAR 
THE WATER. 
THEY DECIDED TO COME FURTHER 
INLAND JUST IN CASE. 
THEY ARE FOR MILLER -- VERY 
FAMILIAR WITH STORM SURGE. 
WAIT THAT'S INTERESTING THAT 
60% OF PEOPLE DECIDED TO STAY. 
>> Reporter: YES. 
THAT WAS SOMETHING THE 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WAS NOT 
GOING TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND 
TELL THEM TO LEAVE EVEN THOUGH 
IT WAS MANDATORY. 
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT MANPOWER. 
IT IS ALMOST -- THOSE PEOPLE 
AREN'T THEIR OWN RISK. 
THE AMBULANCES ARE INLAND. 
ONE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS 
WAS OUT THERE SERVING SOME OF 
THE DAMAGE BEFORE THE EYE HIT. 
HE BASICALLY SAID IF ANYBODY 
HAS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AT THIS 
POINT, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO WAIT UNTIL THE HURRICANE 
PASSES. 
THAT IS ANOTHER REASON WHY THEY 
TELL PEOPLE TO LEAVE. 
IF YOU NEED HELP, IT'S NOT 
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. 
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR 
HAT. 
OMAR VILLAFRANCA, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE HAVE MUCH MORE NEWS TO GET 
TO. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR HURRICANE MICHAEL.  
>>> WE WANT TO TAKE YOU NOT TO 
COVERAGE FROM WCTV  FOR MORE ON 
THE STORM. 
>> HERE YOU SEE SOME OF THE 
WINDS JUST HITTING THE TREES IN 
TALLAHASSEE NEAR THE CAPITAL 
DOWNTOWN. 
THIS IS WHAT CAUSES THE PROBLEMS
. SOME OF THESE TREES COME DOWN 
ON POWER LINES AND KNOCK OUT 
THE POWER AS THE NUMBERS 
CONTINUE TO RISE AND THAT WIND 
DRIVEN RAIN IS BEING HEARD ON 
THE ROOF OF THE STATION AGAIN 
RIGHT NOW. 
IT SEEMS LIKE IT GETS LOUDER 
AND STRONGER AND THE WINDS GET 
STRONGER AS WELL. 
>> TREES ARE REMARKABLY 
FLEXIBLE BUT WHEN YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT WINDS IN EXCESS S 
OF 50, 70 MILES PER HOUR, THERE 
IS A LIMIT TO THAT. 
TALLAHASSEE IS KNOWN FOR ITS 
BEAUTIFUL TREES. 
THIS IS THE TOUGH PART OF THAT. 
>> WE ALWAYS LOVE THE TREES IN 
TALLAHASSEE THAT THEY DO TEND 
TO CAUSE A PROBLEM WHEN 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS KICK UP. 
>> I THINK  THE GOOD NEWS IS 
AFTER HURRICAE HERMINE WE 
LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS ON HOW 
TO RESPOND. 
THERE CREWS THAT ARE WAITING TO 
GET TO WORK. 
THE FLOW OF COMMUNICATION IS 
MINUTE TO MINUTE. 
I THINK WE LEARNED A LOT FROM 
THAT STORM AND HOPEFULLY THE 
RESPONSE THIS TIME AROUND TO 
WHAT IS SURE TO BE LOTS OF 
DOWNED TREES AND POWER LINES IS 
QUICK. 
>> LET'S TAKE A LIVE LOOK 
OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.  THIS IS OUR 
TOWER CAMERA AT WCTV. 
YOU CAN SEE THE I-10 FLYOVER. 
IT'S VERY QUIET.  
THERE IS MAYBE ONE CAR IN THE 
DISTANCE. 
PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY STAYING 
INSIDE AND STAYING HUNKERED 
INSIDE. 
YOU CAN SEE THE CAMERA SHAKING 
IN THE BREEZE. 
>> AND AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING 
WITH YOU OVER THE LAST HOUR OR 
SO, WE HAVE TAKEN SOME 
INCREDIBLE POWER HEADS AT THE 
STATION. 
THE LIGHTS ARE FLICKERING. 
THERE IS A LOT GOING ON. 
I'M SURE THAT IS THE SCENE AT 
YOUR HOME AS WELL. 
>> LET'S GO BACK OVER TO MIKE 
McCALL WITH THE LATEST. 
JUST SEEING THAT RADAR PICTURE 
FROM EARLIER, MIKE, AND HOW THE 
RAIN IS FROM GAINESVILLE TO 
PENSACOLA. 
THIS IS CAUSING PROBLEMS FOR 
PEOPLE. 
IT'S HUGE. 
>> IT'S LARGE AN HISTORIC IN A 
BAD SENSE. IT IS THE STRONGEST 
HURRICANE TO MAKE LANDFALL 
ALONG THE GULF COAST IN FLORIDA.
THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN A FEW 
CATEGORY 3 STORMS -- 
>> JONAH ME KNOW BY PHONE IS 
SARAH CANNON. 
HOW BETTER THE CONDITIONS WHERE 
YOU ARE NOW? 
>> RIGHT NOW, I'M LOOKING 
OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW IN FRONT 
OF MY HOUSE. 
WE CAN SEE A STRONG WIND COMI 
IN FROM THE NORTH. 
THE PALM TREES ARE SWAYING ALL 
THE WAY OVER. 
WE CAN SEE THE TREES IN THE 
WIND AND THE RAIN IS BLOWING 
SIDEWAYS AT THIS POINT. 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF DAMAGE 
YET. 
THANKFULLY. 
THE WIND IS JUST NOW PICKING UP 
HERE. 
I'M TOLD BY THE OFFICIALS THAT 
WE SHOULD EXPECT SUSTAINED 
WINDS OF 50 TO 60 MILES PER 
HOUR WITH GAS UP TO 70. 
IT IS DEFINITELY TROPICALSTORM 
STRENGTH. 
>> WHAT DID YOU -- DO YOU 
EXPECT OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
AND WHAT ARE THE OFFICIALS 
SAYING? 
>> THE OFFICIALS HAVE DONE AN 
AMAZING JOB OF COMMUNICATING 
WITH US. 
LOCALS HAVE TOLD US TO EXPECT 
THE WORST BETWEEN NOW AND 5:00 
P.M. 
CENTRAL TIME. 
WE ARE NOT QUITE OUT OF THE 
WOODS BUT THEY DID SAY THAT WE 
SHOULD EXPECT THE POWER TO GO 
OUT AT SOME POINT. 
THEY DO HAVE CREWS STANDING BY, 
WAITING TO GO OUT TO FIX THE 
POWER. 
THEY HAVE EMPHASIZED TO ALL OF 
US, DO NOT GET ON THE STREETS. 
PLEASE KEEP THOSE ROADS CLEAR 
FOR ANY FIRST RESPONDERS THAT 
NEED TO GO OUT TO HELP OTHERS. 
>> AND HOW CONCERNED ARE 
OFFICIALS OVER THE NEXT 24 TO 
48 HOURS, PEOPLE GETTING 
SUPPLIES AND GETTING GAS AND 
GETTING BACK ON THEIR FEET? 
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TO EXPECT? 
ARE THEY ASKING PEOPLE TO JUST 
STAY HUNKERED DOWN? 
>> BASICALLY, THE OFFICIALS 
HAVE SAID PLEASE DON'T LEAVE 
YOUR HOUSE UNTIL WE GIVE YOU 
THE CLEAR. 
THEY SAY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
THE EMERGENCY FIRST RESPONDERS, 
THE POWER PEOPLE, ARE ABLE TO 
GET OUT AND GET ON THE ROADS TO 
MAKE SURE POWER IS RESTORED. 
CERTAIN AREAS ARE WITHOUT 
POWER. 
MY HOME IS NOT LOST IT YET. 
I WAS TELLING YOUR PRODUCER, 
DOWN IN FLORIDA IT IS STILL 
VERY, VERY HOT. 
TEMPERATURES ARE STILL IN THE 
MID-90s WITH COMMUNITY THAT IS 
HIGH. 
IT IS GOING TO BE VERY 
MISERABLE WHEN THE POWER GOES 
OUT. 
THEY TOLD US FOR THE NEXT DIRTY 
SIX TO 48 HOURS, PLEASE DON'T 
GO OUT OR LESS THEY GIVE YOU 
THE CLEAR. 
-- 36 TO 48 HOURS, PLEASE DON'T 
GO OUT UNLESS THEY GIVE YOU THE 
CLEAR. 
YOU WILL SEE A LOT OF FLOODING 
IN LOW-LYING AREAS. 
>> SARAH, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 
FLORIDA AND THE DIFFERENT AREAS 
THAT CAN FLOOD EASIER, WHERE 
YOU ARE AT, TELL US ABOUT THAT 
AREA AND IS THIS A CONCERN FOR 
OFFICIALS HERE AS WE CONTINUE 
WITH THESE INCREDIBLE HURRICANE 
YEAR AFTER YEAR? 
>> WE HAVE NOT SEEN A DIRECT 
HIT OF A HURRICANE HERE IN OVER 
A DECADE. 
THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD. 
I JUST MOVED HERE WITHIN THE 
LAST YEAR. 
I CAN'T SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE 
BUT I CAN SAY WHAT OTHERS HAVE 
TOLD ME IS THAT TYPICALLY THIS 
HAS A DOME WHERE THE WEATHER 
GOES BY IT. 
FOR US TO EVEN BE GETTING A 
TROPICAL STORM IS SOMEWHAT 
UNUSUAL ALTHOUGH NOT COMPLETELY 
OUT OF THE REALM OF 
POSSIBILITY, OBVIOUSLY. 
AS FAR AS OFFICIALS, I'M JUST A 
LOCAL SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM 
BUT I CAN SAY WHAT THEY HAVE 
BEEN TELLING US. 
DAVID DONE -- THEY HAVE DONE A 
GREAT JOB OF COMMUNICATING. 
THIS IS HOW YOU SHOULD EXPECT 
TO COMMUNICATE WITH FAMILIES. 
SOME ZONES IN MY COUNTY WERE 
GIVING MANDATORY ORDERS. 
THEY WERE IN LIGHT -- LOW LYING 
AREAS. 
AND SO, MAKE SURE YOU GET OUT 
AND FIND A PLACE OR -- IN MY 
HOUSE, WE ARE GRATEFUL AND 
VERY, VERY HOPEFUL WE WILL BE 
OKAY AND THAT THE WORST WILL BE 
THE POWER GOING OUT. 
OUR HEARTS AND OUR THOUGHTS AND 
PRAYERS ARE WITH THOSE IN 
PANAMA CITY AND FURTHER EAST.  
WE KNOW THEY ARE GETTING THE 
BRUNT OF IT. 
>> THEY CERTAINLY ARE. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR JOINING US FROM FLORIDA. 
>>> JOINING ME NOW WE HAVE 
JONATHAN McNAMARA. 
HE IS A COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR 
FOR THE RED CROSS IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN 
RIGHT NOW? 
>> RIGHT NOW, WE CONCERNED WITH 
PEOPLE NOT LISTENING TO THE 
WARNINGS FROM A LOCAL 
OFFICIALS. 
I'M LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND 
CONDITIONS HAVE DETERIORATED 
RAPIDLY. 
IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU 
LISTEN TO LOCAL OFFICIALS. 
STAY IN YOUR HOME. 
PORTAGE MUCH DISTANCE BETWEEN 
YOU AND OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME AS 
POSSIBLE. 
NO INTO AN INTERIOR ROOM -- GO 
INTO AN INTERIOR ROOM. 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU HEED 
THE WARNINGS. 
>> AT THIS POINT FOR PEOPLE 
HUNKERING DOWN, WE ARE SEEING 
IMAGES FROM PANAMA CITY PEACH , 
IT IS INCREDIBLE THE WEIGHT 
HOME TREES ARE SWAYING. 
-- BEACH, IT IS INCREDIBLE THE 
WAY THE PALM TREES ARE SWAYING. 
HOW DOES THE WILL RED CROSS 
RESPOND? 
WHAT YOU NEED? 
HOW CAN PEOPLE HELP? 
>> WE HAVE ABOUT 500 WORKERS 
ENGAGED CURRENTLY. 
OVER THE DAYS TO COME, ONCE 
CONDITIONS ARE SAFE, WE'LL 
START TO MOVE INTO NEIGHBORHOODS
AND GO NEIGHBORHOOD BY 
NEIGHBORHOOD PROVIDING FOOD AND 
THE TYPES OF SERVICES YOU 
EXPECT FROM THE AMERICAN RED 
CROSS AND ALSO PROVIDING 
SHELTERS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY 
HAVE DAMAGED HOMES. 
ENCOURAGE VIEWERS TO DOWNLOAD 
THE EMERGENCY APP. 
IT WILL HAVE A FULL LIST OF 
SHELTERS AVAILABLE AFTER THE 
STORM AND CHECK THE WEBSITE FOR 
SPECIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT 
SHELTERS AND OTHER LOCATIONS 
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP YOU 
STAY SAFE. 
THE GENEROSITY OF YOUR VIEWERS 
ALLOWED US TO RESPOND. 
IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE A 
DONATION YOU CAN GO TO RED 
CROSS.ORG. 
ONE LAST THING, AMPLIFY THE 
MESSAGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA, NOT 
JUST FROM THE RED CROSS BUT

IF YOU SEE THAT, REPOSTED -- 
REPOST IT. 
>> JONATHAN WITH THE RED CROSS 
IN TALLAHASSEE. 
I HOPE YOU AND THE CREW STAY 
SAFE. 
TAKE CARE. 
I'M GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A 
QUICK BREAK. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER NEWS AS 
WELL. 
WE ARE MONITORING THE BIG STORY 
TODAY. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
STAY WITH US.  
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS, 
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY. 
>> AT 12 NOON, HIGH TIDE ROLLED 
IN. 
>> RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T TELL 
THE RIVERS FROM THE ROAD. 
>> IS A LOT OF WIND. 
>> THIS IS A MASSIVE OAK TREE 
THAT WAS TOPPLED. 
>> FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES, 
THEY ARE HOPING THAT THEY STILL 
HAVE HOMES TO RETURN TO. 
>> THIS IS THE WORST IT'S EVER 
BEEN, THIS IS SCARY. 
>> THIS IS SOME OF THE WORST OF 
FLORENCE. 
>>> HURRICANE MICHAEL IS NOW 
LASHING THROUGH THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. 
THE CATEGORY FOUR STORM IS 
POUNDING PANAMA CITY WITH HEAVY 
RAIN, A POWERFUL WIND, 
HURRICANE MICHAEL HAS ALREADY 
KNOCKED OUT POWER FOR MORE THAN 
173,000 CUSTOMERS IN FLORIDA. 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE IN 
EFFECT FOR 30 MILLION PEOPLE 
FROM FLORIDA'S GULF COAST ALL 
THE WAY TO NORTH CAROLINA. 
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL 
HURRICANE CENTER CAM GRAHAM HAS 
THE LATEST. 
WE TAKE YOU NOW TO THE DIRECTOR 
OF THE NATIONAL HURRICANE 
CENTER, KEN GRAHAM, WHO HAS THE 
LATEST. 
>> HURRICANE MICHAEL MADE 
LANDFALL, PRESSURE 919 
MILLIBARS, WINS 155 MILES PER 
HOUR,  AND PRETTY STRONG SYSTEM 
CONTINUING, DAMAGING WINDS 
ASSOCIATED, LET'S LOOK AT THE 
RADAR, THAT EYEWALL MAKING 
LANDFALL, THAT WHEN WARNING IS 
WE SHOULD BUY OUR WEATHER 
FORECAST IN TALLAHASSEE, IT'S 
AN INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS SITUATED
-- SITUATION ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE WIND. 
WE ALSO GOT A LOOK AT DIFFERENT 
AREAS AS WELL, SOME OF THOSE 
RAIN BANDS COMING, THE TORNADO 
POSSIBILITY AND SOME OF THE 
HURRICANE FORCE GUSTS WITH 
THOSE AS WELL, IT'S NOT JUST 
THE CENTER, IT'S WELL OUT FROM 
THE CENTER. 
SOMETHING THAT I DEFINITELY 
WANT TO MENTION, IF YOU HAPPEN 
TO BE IN THESE AREAS, IF YOU 
DIDN'T LEAVE, AND THE I COMES 
THROUGH, IT COULD MOMENTARILY 
GET CALM, BUT REMEMBER, YOU 
HAVE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE I 
COMING, SO STAY SAFE, STAY 
SHELTERED, IT'S A DANGEROUS 
SITUATION, AS YOU CAN SEE. 
YOU LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT, AND 
WHERE THE SYSTEM IS HEADED, 
LOOK AT THESE TROPICAL STORM 
FORCE WINDS EXTENDING 175 IN 
THAT MIKE MILES AWAY FROM THE 
CENTER, AT AROUND THE CENTER 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS 45 MILES 
AWAY. 
WHEN HE DOES NOT FOCUS JUST ON 
THE CENTER, YOU NEED TO THINK 
OF IT AS A LARGE STORM CAUSING 
DAMAGE FOR A LARGE AREA, 
DAMAGING ON THE COAST, POWER 
OUTAGE BECAUSE OF THESE WINDS 
COULD LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, 
CATASTROPHIC WITH BUILDING 
DAMAGE, TREES DOWN, POWER 
OUTAGE, NOT JUST THE COAST. 
WE STILL EXPECT HURRICANE FORCE 
WINDS STRETCHING ON THE ALABAMA 
GEORGIA STATE LINE, AND EVEN 
MOVING INTO CENTRAL GEORGIA 
COULD STILL HAVE WINS CLOSE TO 
HURRICANE STRENGTH. 
IF YOU TAKE THE RAIN AND TAKE 
THOSE WINDS, YOU CAN HAVE POWER 
OUTAGES AND TREES DOWN 
REMAINING DANGEROUS THROUGH 
GEORGIA AND IN PORTIONS OF 
SOUTHEAST ALABAMA AND INTO THE 
CAROLINAS, TAKING A LOOK AT 
THAT RAIN, YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF 
FLASH FLOODING, SERIOUS 
SITUATIONS, ANYTIME YOU HAVE 
THESE TROPICAL SYSTEMS COME IN, 
THE RAINFALL IS HEAVY, 6 TO 10 
INCHES OF RAIN FOR THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE INTO PORTIONS OF 
SOUTHEAST ALABAMA, INTO 
GEORGIA. 
LOOK AT THOSE LARGE AREAS, 4 TO 
6 INCHES OF RAIN, THAT'S WHERE 
YOU WILL HAVE SOME OF THOSE 
WINDS, SOME OF THE SATURATED 
SOILS, AND IT COULD BE 
DANGEROUS INLAND. 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE 
STORM SURGE, AND WE'VE BEEN 
LOOKING AT THE LATEST VALUES 
COMING IN, AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
WE'VE GOT SEVEN .4 FEET 
INUNDATION IN APPALACHIA, SO 
THE STORM SURGE COMING IN WITH 
A VENGEANCE, AND EVEN THOUGH 
THE SYSTEM IS INLAND, YOU CAN 
STILL HAVE THAT ONSHORE FLOW 
PUSHING THE WATER IN, SO JUST 
BECAUSE THE STORM IS INLAND, 
YOU ARE STILL NOT OUT OF DANGER 
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT STORM 
SURGE. 
WE WERE FORFEIT -- WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO FORECAST 14 FEET IN 
AREAS FROM TYNDALL AIR FORCE 
BASE, THAT'S INUNDATION, NINE 
FOOT TO 14 FOOT ABOVE GROUND 
WAVES ON TOP OF IT, AND SOME OF 
THE IMAGES WE ARE SEEING, YOU 
CAN SEE THE WATER COME IN, AND 
ON TOP THERE IS THE DAMAGING 
WAVES THAT CAN CAUSE STRUCTURL 
DAMAGE AS WELL. 
GETTING TRAPPED IN THESE 
POCKETS, THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF 
 
WELL AWAY FROM THE CENTER, YOU 
ARE STILL NOT SAFE. 
THERE'S ELEVATED VALUES, 6 TO 9 
FOOT ABOVE GROUND ALL THE WAY 
TO CEDAR KEY, AND AS FAR AS 
TAMPA 2 TO 4 FEET ABOVE GROUND. 
THAT IS NOT ON THE COAST, YOU 
CAN SEE SOME OF THE STORM SURGE 
GOES INLAND AS THE WINDS 
CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT WATER 
FURTHER INLAND. 
THIS HAS BEEN KEN GRAHAM WITH 
THE UPDATES ON A DANGEROUS AND 
POWERFUL HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>>> NICOLE KILLIAN IN PANAMA 
CITY BEACH ON THE PHONE, NICOLE 
JOINS US. 
EARLIER, YOUR CREW WAS WORKING 
TO KEEP UP THE GEAR, WE SEE 
FROM YOUR LIVE SHOT THOSE TREES 
BLOWING IN THE WIND, TELL US 
WHAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> Reporter: AT THIS POINT, 
WE'VE TAKEN SHELTER IN A HOTEL 
WHERE WE ARE STAYING, NOT TOO 
LONG AFTER WE DID THAT LIVE 
SHOT. 
WE HAD COME IN BECAUSE, AT THAT 
POINT, THE STORM WAS MAKING 
LANDFALL, AS THE RAIN AND WIND 
REALLY GOT INTENSE, AT TIMES 
YOU COULD SEE LITERALLY A WALL 
OF WATER PASS THROUGH, AND THAT 
TRADITIONAL CLASSIC SOUND OF A 
TRAIN THAT YOU HEAR WITH STRONG 
WINDS GUSTING THROUGH, SO WE 
HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT, MAYBE 
THAT'S TOO CASUAL A TERM, HERE 
IN THE HOTEL, WE HAVE LOST 
POWER, EVEN SOME PARTS OF THE 
HOTEL ARE STARTING TO COME 
APART AS WELL, SOME OF THE 
CEILING TILES HAVE COME DOWN, 
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME LEAKS 
COMING FROM THE CEILING, THERE 
ARE OTHER MEDIA HERE AS WELL, 
BUT HE IS TRYING TO NAVIGATE 
THE SITUATION AS BEST WE CAN. 
IT APPEARS AT THIS POINT THAT 
SOME OF THE WIND HAS STARTED TO 
DIE DOWN, BUT WE KNOW WE ARE 
NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET. 
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU 
AND THE CREW WILL HAVE TO TAKE 
SHELTER AT THIS POINT? 
>> Reporter: I WOULD THINK FOR 
AT LEAST THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO, 
UNTIL THESE CONDITIONS IMPROVE, 
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL DEBRIS 
BLOWING AROUND OUT THERE, AT 
THE LIVE POSITION WHERE WE 
WERE, WE JUST SAW, AS I 
MENTIONED, A WALL OF WATER 
COMING THROUGH, AND THE GRASSY 
SPACE BEHIND US FILLED UP WITH 
WATER. 
SOME OF THAT HAS RECEDED, BUT 
AGAIN, I'M LOOKING RIGHT NOW AT 
ALL TYPES OF DEBRIS THAT IS ON 
THE GROUND, PIECES OF TREES, 
SMALL, LARGE, ALL SIZES. 
OBVIOUSLY WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE 
A DETERMINATION AS THINGS 
PROGRESS. 
>> REMARKABLE TO HEAR THAT. 
YOU CAN SEE PIECES OF THAT 
HOTEL COMING APART, WHAT HAS 
BEEN THE CONCERN WHEN YOU TALK 
TO OFFICIALS IN THAT AREA? 
WHAT'S THE BIG CONCERN AT THIS 
POINT? 
>> Reporter: A COUPLE OF 
THINGS, THE MAIN CONCERN THAT 
THE LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES 
HAD FOR PEOPLE THAT CHOSE TO 
RIDE OUT THE STORM AND DIDN'T 
EVACUATE, AND THERE HAVE BEEN 
SHELTERS THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP 
FOR THOSE FOLKS, BUT THERE ARE 
CLEARLY FOLKS WHO DIDN'T HEED 
THOSE WARNINGS, RIGHT BEFORE 
THINGS PICKED UP, WE HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE 
POLICE CHIEF OF PANAMA CITY 
BEACH, AND HE SAID, I CAN'T 
FORCE PEOPLE TO LEAVE THEIR 
HOMES, AT A CERTAIN POINT IN 
TIME, HE HAS TO PROTECT HIS OWN 
FORCE. 
WE DID SEE THE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES SAY AT A CERTAIN 
POINT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO 
COME OUT AND SAVE YOU, THAT'S 
THE MESSAGE THAT THE GOVERNOR 
CONVEYED AS WELL, UNTIL 
CONDITIONS IMPROVE. 
>> GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT HAS A 
GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE 
DEALING WITH HURRICANES AND 
GETTING HURRICANES THAT SMACKED 
THE WORD OUT, WHAT HAS HE BEEN 
SAYING OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS? 
>> Reporter: HE HAS BEEN TRYING 
TO EMPHASIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS 
IS, AND HOW SERIOUS PEOPLE 
SHOULD TAKE THIS, OBVIOUSLY THIS
IS A STORM, THE MAGNITUDE OF 
THIS STORM IS ONE OF THIS PART 
OF FLORIDA HASN'T SEEN OR 
EXPERIENCED IN AT LEAST A 
CENTURY, HE MADE THAT CLEAR, I 
THINK WHAT SURPRISED US ALL IS 
THE INTENSITY OF THE STORM, 
THIS CAME ASHORE AT 155 MILES 
PER HOUR , JUST SHY OF CATEGORY 
FIVE. 
TO WATCH HOW RAPIDLY IT PICKED 
UP IN STRENGTH, I THINK IT WAS 
JUST REMARKABLE. 
>> WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE? 
AS WE WERE WATCHING YOU, WE 
SAW, AS I MENTIONED, WHAT 
APPEARED TO BE YOUR CAMERA GEAR 
MOVING AROUND, YOUR PRODUCER 
STEPPING IN TO MAKE SURE IT 
WASN'T HITTING YOU, HOW DID IT 
DETERIORATE TO FORCE YOU TO 
SEEK SHELTER INSIDE THE HOTEL? 
>> Reporter: THIS WAS AT THE 
CLIMAX OF THE STORM, RIGHT AS 
IT WAS COMING ASHORE AND MAKING 
LANDFALL, AND AS YOU KNOW, 
THAT'S WERE THE STRONGEST WINDS 
ARE, IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE 
IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO 
STAND, WE CONTINUED TO SEE 
DURING THE SHOT, WE POINTED OUT 
A ROOF THAT WAS COMING APART, 
AD AN AUTO BODY SHOP, AND 
BEING OUT IN THOSE CONDITIONS, 
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE 
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR, THAT'S 
WHY WE MADE THE CALL, EVEN AS 
SOON AS WE CAME IN AND BROUGHT 
ALL OUR GEAR IN, THE DOOR 
LEADING OUTSIDE KEPT BLOWING 
OPEN, SO IT TOOK OUR CREW, AND 
THE TWO PEOPLE WHO WERE MANNING 
THIS HOTEL FOR US TO TRY TO TIE 
THE DOOR DOWN AND KEEP IT SHUT 
SO THAT WE DIDN'T GET THOSE 
GUEST COMING INTO THE HALLWAY. 
THINKING THAT WE WERE SEEKING 
SHELTER, WHEN REALLY WE WERE, 
ONCE AGAIN, EXPOSED. 
>> I'M GLAD YOU AND THE CREW 
ARE SAFE AND SEEKING SHELTER 
RIGHT NOW, WE WILL CHECK BACK 
WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON, THANK 
YOU. 
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 
>> I'M TONYA RIVERO, JOINED BY 
CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTING 
METEOROLOGIST JEFF BARRETT 
ELLIE. 
JEFF, GET US UP TO SPEED. 
WE KNOW THAT HURRICANE MICHAEL 
IS A CATEGORY FOUR, AND JUST 
MADE LANDFALL. 
>> Reporter: IT BLIP MADE 
LANDFALL WITH WINDS OF 155 
MILES PER HOUR, TO BE CATEGORY 
FIVE, THE WINDS WOULD'VE HAD TO 
BE 156 MILES PER HOUR, SO THAT 
A COUPLE MORE MINUTES OVER THE 
WATER, IT WOULD BE A CATEGORY 
FIVE.  
BUT FOR ALL INTENTS AND 
PURPOSES, THIS WAS A 
LANDFALLING CATEGORY FIVE 
HURRICANE. 
>> ARE WE ENTERING UNCHARTED 
TERRITORY HERE? 
PUT THIS STORM INTO PERSPECTIVE 
FOR US, IN A HISTORICAL WAY. 
>> IT'S EITHER THE 3rd OR 4th 
STRONGEST HURRICANE ON RECORD 
IN THE U.S.  3rd IF YOU LOOK AT 
PRESSURE, 4th IF YOU LOOK AT 
WIND,  SO THIS IS A STRONG 
HURRICANE, IT'S THE KIND OF 
HURRICANE THAT HAPPENS ONCE 
EVERY 25 YEARS OR SO ON AVERAGE,
AND A LOT OF THE BUILDINGS IN 
FLORIDA UNTESTED FOR WINS THIS 
STRONG. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
BUILDING CODE, BECAUSE 
HURRICANE ANDREW SET THE 
BUILDING CODE FOR A CATEGORY 
THREE, IS THAT RIGHT? 
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN. 
>> AFTER HURRICANE ANDREW, 
THERE WAS DEVASTATION. 
I WAS TELLING YOU BEFORE THE 
PEOPLE WOULD RETURN TO THEIR 
HOME AND NOT KNOW WHERE THEIR 
HOME WAS, EVERYTHING WAS 
OBLITERATED, THERE WERE NO 
LANDMARKS. 
AFTER THAT, MIAMI-DADE DECIDED 
TO PUT TOGETHER A BUILDING CODE 
THAT ENSURED THAT PEOPLE BUILD 
THEIR HOUSES UP THE CATEGORY 
THREE STANDARD. 
ANY HOMES AFTER THE MID-90s 
WERE BUILT TO WITHSTAND 
CATEGORY THREE. 
THIS WAS A BORDERLINE CATEGORY 
FIVE, SO A LOT OF THE 
STRUCTURES AND FLORIDA UNTESTED.
THERE WERE PLENTY OF HOMES 
AROUND THE PANAMA CITY AREA 
THAT ARE NOT BILLED FOR 
CATEGORY THREE, BECAUSE THEY 
WERE BUILT BEFORE THAT, OR THEY 
ARE MOBILE HOMES. 
WE ARE IN A SITUATION HERE 
WHERE WE WON'T GET AWAY WITHOUT 
DEVASTATING LOSSES IN TERMS OF 
THE HOUSES. 
>> AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY 1ST-
HAND REPORTS, IT'S TOO EARLY TO 
KNOW  EXACTLY WHAT IT LOOKS 
LIKE. 
>> I'VE SEEN SOME VIDEO, FROM 
WHAT I SAW IT WAS LOCATED ON 
THE BEACH AROUND PORT SAINT JOE.
DEVASTATION. 
I COULDN'T TELL IF THAT WAS 
FROM WIND OR WATER. 
I KNOW THAT AT LAST CHECK, 
WATER LEVELS WERE A GOOD SIX, 
SEVEN, MAYBE EIGHT FEET ABOVE 
NORMAL IN APALACHICOLA, WHICH 
IS FAR EAST OF WHERE THE CENTER 
MADE LANDFALL. 
IT'S A COMBINATION OF WIND AND 
WATER ON THE BEACH, I SAW A 
RUBBLE. 
>> TELL US, HOW DO YOU BUILD A 
CATEGORY THREE BUILDING THAT 
CAN WITHSTAND THAT? 
TO THE NEED TO HAVE STEEL 
BEAMS? 
HOW COMPLICATED IS IT? 
>> YOU NEED CONCRETE BLOCK, THE 
OUTSET OF THE HOUSE, THE 
FOUNDATION, NEEDS TO BE BUILT 
ON THE EDGES WITH CONCRETE 
BLOCK AND YOU NEED TO BE ABLE 
TO STRAP THE ROOF ONTO THE 
HOUSE. 
THE 1st THING THAT GOES IN 
HURRICANE IS THE ROOF.  
ONCE HER ROOF IS COMPROMISED, 
EVERYTHING IS COMPROMISED. 
IF ONE OF YOUR WINDOWS BLOWS 
IN, AND IT, THE WIND CAN COME 
IN AND PULL YOUR ROOF OFF, 
UPWARD VERTICALLY, THE WHOLE 
HOUSE CAN BE DESTROYED. 
THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE 
HURRICANE SHUTTERS, HURRICANE 
PANELS ON YOUR WINDOWS, OR 
STORM WINDOWS, WHICH PREVENTS 
THE WIND FROM GETTING IN. 
ONCE THE WIND GETS IN, BLOWS 
THE ROOF OFF, THEN IT JUST 
COMPROMISES THE WHOLE 
STRUCTURE. 
>> WITH A CATEGORY FOUR, WE 
DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAPPEN. 
>> WE'VE SEEN EVIDENCE OF IT, 
WITH THE BUILDINGS, THE WAY WE 
ARE BUILT TODAY, WE WILL SEE IF 
THE CATEGORY THREE CODE CAN 
WITHSTAND CATEGORY FOUR COME 
ALMOST CATEGORY FIVE. 
IT'S UNLIKELY IN SOME 
SCENARIOS, ESPECIALLY IF THE 
ROOF GIVES. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE RAIN, 
WHAT KIND OF RAIN IS THIS AREA 
SEEING. 
>> THE STORM IS MOVING FAST, 
BUT THERE WILL BE THE LEAST OF 
THEIR CONCERNS AND FLORIDA. 
THE STRONGEST WINDS ARE GETTING 
TO THE GEORGIA BORDER LINE 
RIGHT NOW, ONE THING I 
MENTIONED BEFORE I WANT TO 
MENTION AGAIN, THIS STORM WAS 
STRENGTHENING IT LANDFALL, 
WHICH MEANS IT HAS TO STABILIZE 
AND THEN WE CAN. 
BECAUSE IT HAS A FORWARD 
MOMENTUM IN TERMS OF ITS 
INTENSITY, IT WILL TAKE LONGER 
FOR IT TO WE CAN, WHICH MEANS 
IT WILL STAY STRONGER OVER 
GEORGIA, AND IT'S ABOUT TO MOVE 
INTO GEORGIA. 
THE WORST OF IT IN GEORGIA IS 
GOING TO BE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. 
>> THAT'S THE RAIN AND THE 
WIND? 
>> THAT'S THE RAIN, THE WIND. 
THEN, AFTER THAT, IT MOVES INTO 
SOUTH CAROLINA AND NORTH 
CAROLINA, THE WORST WILL BE 
OVERNIGHT IN GEORGIA, SOUTH 
CAROLINA AND NORTH CAROLINA 
TOMORROW, AND THEN OFF THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD BY FRIDAY 
MORNING. 
DURING THAT TIME, IT WILL DROP 
6 TO 9 INCHES OF RAIN IN SOUTH 
CAROLINA AND NORTH CAROLINA 
INTO THOSE SAME RIVERS THAT 
WERE SWOLLEN FROM FLORENCE. 
UNFORTUNATELY, WE DON'T NEED TO 
DROP MORE RAIN THERE, BUT IT 
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GOING TO BE 
A WHOLE LOT IN A SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
>> THEY CAN DEFINITELY EXPECT 
STORM SURGE AS WELL. 
>> IT'S RIVER FLOODING, THAT 
THEY WILL SEE. 
THE POOR FOLKS THERE HAVE BEEN 
THROUGH SO MUCH, THERE'S NO 
TELLING HOW HIGH THE RIVERS 
WILL GO, BUT THERE WILL BE 
FLASH FLOODING IN THE 
CAROLINAS. 
>> THIS STORM CAME ABOUT 
QUICKLY, ARE YOU HEARING THAT 
EVERYONE WHO NEEDED TO EVACUATE 
WAS ABLE TO DO SO? 
>> HERE'S THE PROBLEM. 
COMING FROM FLORIDA, KNOWING 
PEOPLE THERE, THEY HAVE BEEN 
THROUGH STORMS BEFORE. 
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY PREDICTED 
TO BE A CATEGORY ONE, THEN 
CATEGORY TWO, ANYONE WHO WAITED 
TOO LONG TO MAKE A DECISION, 
EVEN THOUGH WE THOUGHT THIS 
MIGHT BE A THREE OR FOUR MAJOR 
HURRICANE WOULD'VE MADE 
LANDFALL A FEW DAYS AGO, ANYONE 
WHO WAITED TOO LONG TO EVACUATE
, OR WAS STUBBORN AND SAID I 
DON'T WANT TO EVACUATE, THERE'S 
A LOT OF PEOPLE I CAN TELL YOU 
FROM EXPERIENCE, A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WHO DID NOT LEAVE. 
IT HAPPENS IN EVERY STORM, 
PEOPLE THINK THEY'VE BEEN 
THROUGH A STORM LIKE THIS 
BEFORE. 
THIS IS THE 3rd STRONGEST STORM 
IN U.S. HISTORY, THEY HAVE NOT 
EVER BEEN THROUGH A STORM OF 
THIS MAGNITUDE, AND IT WAS A 
STRENGTHENING STORM IT 
LANDFALL.  
STRENGTHENING STORMS IT 
LANDFALL PRODUCE A LOT MORE 
DAMAGE THAN WEAKENING STORMS OF 
THE SAME MAGNITUDE. 
YOU HAVE TWO STORMS THAT ARE 
BOTH 155, THE ONE THAT IS 
STRENGTHENING WILL PRODUCE A 
LOT MORE DAMAGE THAN A 
WEAKENING ONE. 
>> THERE WASN'T A LOT OF 
WARNING FOR THIS STORM, AND 
NOBODY EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN 
SO QUICKLY. 
>> I CAN SAY I WAS SURPRISED, 
TO BE HONEST. 
I SAW THE WATER TEMPERATURES 4 
TO 6 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL IN 
THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO, 
THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR THIS TO 
BE A CATEGORY FOUR, I THINK IT 
WOULD GET TO 155? 
THAT SEEMED UNLIKELY, BUT 140, 
1:45, EITHER WAY,  YOU WOULD 
EVACUATE WITH WINDS LIKE THAT. 
I WAS SURPRISED BY THAT, BUT IT 
HAPPENED FAST. 
WE SAW RAPID INTENSIFICATION, 
IT HAPPENED WITHIN 48 HOURS, 
AND PEOPLE NEED MORE TIME TO 
PROCESS, AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE 
ENOUGH TIME, EVEN THOUGH THE 
FORECAST TOLD PEOPLE TO GET OUT,
PEOPLE MAY HAVE STAYED, AND I 
KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DID, AND I 
HAVE TO HOPE THE BEST. 
>> WE ARE ALL PRAYING FOR THEM. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT 
UPDATE. 
WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK, 
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE 
CBSN, STAY WITH US. 
>> I WANT TO BRING IN OUR NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT, HE JOINS US FROM 
PORT SAINT JOE, IN FLORIDA, 
HE'S ON THE PHONE. 
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 
EXPERIENCING. 
>> RIGHT NOW, WE ARE STARTING 
TO GET SOME OF THE BACKSIDE OF 
THE BANDS FROM HURRICANE 
MICHAEL. 
WE SAW PLENTY OF LAND AS THE 
STORM SYSTEM IS MOVING ONTO 
SHORE, SOME OF THE TALL PINE 
TREES THAT ARE DOTTING ALL THE 
LANDSCAPES HERE, OR JUST 
BENDING OVER SIDEWAYS. 
WE SAW TREE SNAP, WE SAW PIECES 
OF BUILDING THAT WERE COMING 
OFF, POWER IS OUT IN THIS AREA 
OF GULF COUNTY, AND THAT WILL 
BE SOMETHING THAT THE FOLKS 
WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS. 
AND MAYBE EVEN LONGER. 
STORM SURGE IS A BIG CONCERN, 
PEOPLE ARE STAYING OFF THE ROAD,
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 
THE BAD NEWS IS, THAT STORM 
SURGE CAME WITH SOME PEER HE. 
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES, WE SAW 
WATER ON THE ROAD THAT WAS JUST 
A FEW INCHES, RIDES UP TO 
ALMOST 2 FEET, IT WAS MOVING 
VERY QUICKLY. 
WE LITERALLY PARKED TO GET SOME 
SHOTS OF VIDEO, AND IT WAS 
RISING UP VERY FAST. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HUNKERED 
DOWN, THERE WAS AN EVACUATION 
ORDER IN THE AREA, ROUGHLY 35 
HUNDRED PEOPLE -- 3500 PEOPLE 
LIVE IN SOUTH -- PORT SAINT 
JOE, THEY BELIEVE ABOUT 60%, 
MORE THAN HALF THE PEOPLE HERE 
IN PORT SAINT JOE WERE 
GATHERING SUPPLIES AND WERE 
HUNKERING DOWN. 
THERE'S A SMALL MOTEL THAT'S 
AROUND HERE, AND THE PARKING 
LOT IS PACKED, AND IT'S A LOT 
OF LOCALS WHO WERE AT THEIR 
VACATION HOMES OR THEIR HOMES 
NEAR THE WATER, AND THEY 
DECIDED TO COME FARTHER INLAND 
JUST IN CASE. 
THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH 
STORM SURGE. 
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR YOU 
SAY THAT OFFICIALS ARE SAYING 
THAT 60% OF PEOPLE CHOSE TO 
STAY, AND HUNKER DOWN. 
>> THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE 
SHERIFF DEPARTMENT WAS NOT 
GOING TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND 
PULL PEOPLE OUT AND TELL THEM 
TO LEAVE, AND IT WAS A 
MANDATORY EVACUATION, THEY JUST 
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF 
MANPOWER. 
IT'S ALMOST THAT THOSE PEOPLE 
ARE AT THEIR OWN RISK. 
THE HOSPITAL HERE IS CLOSED, 
THE AMBULANCES ARE INLAND. 
ONE OF THE COUNTY 
COMMISSIONERS, WE SAW THEM OUT 
THERE SURVEYING THE DAMAGE 
BEFORE THE I HIT, AND HE 
BASICALLY SAID, IF ANYBODY HAS 
A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AT THIS 
POINT, THEY WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
UNTIL THE HURRICANE PASSES AND 
IT'S SAFE FOR RESPONDERS. 
THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY THEY 
TOLD PEOPLE TO LEAVE, BECAUSE 
IF YOU NEED HELP, IT'S NOT 
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. 
>> IT'S INCREDIBLE TO HEAR YOU 
SAY THAT. 
IN PORT SAINT JOE FLORIDA, 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
CBS NEWS WITH A PRODUCER DAVID 
PARKINSON JOINS US NOW. 
WHAT'S THE LATEST? 
>> THE LATEST IS THE STORM HAS 
MADE LANDFALL,  IT MADE 
LANDFALL AT 155 MILES PER HOUR, 
AND IT CONTINUES TO LOOK FAIRLY 
HEALTHY,  STORMS ARE SUPPOSED 
TO GRADE AFTER THE MAKE 
LANDFALL, AND THIS ONE SEEMS TO 
BE KEEPING ITS ACT TOGETHER. 
WE ARE ON TO PART TWO OF THE 
STORM, WHICH WILL BE THE INLAND 
IMPACTS. 
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE 
STORM SURGE THREAT IS DONE, THE 
STORM SURGE IS STILL RISING IN 
PLACES, BUT IF YOU ARE IN 
PANAMA CITY, PANAMA CITY BEACH 
AND YOU ARE HUNKER DOWN, YOU 
HAVE ANOTHER HOUR OR SO OF THE 
EYEWALL TO DEAL WITH, THEN THE 
WINDS START BACKING DOWN ON THE 
OTHER SIDE. 
WE'VE HAD SUSTAINED WINDS IN 
THE TRIPLE DIGITS, GUSTS INTO 
THE 120, AND THAT'S WHAT WAS 
RECORDED BY OUR MEASUREMENTS 
THAT HAVEN'T BROKEN. 
THAT SHOULD GIVE YOU AN 
INDICATION OF HOW SERIOUS THE 
STORM IS. 
THERE'S NO EVACUATING, WHAT WE 
ARE IN THE MEAT OF THIS THING, 
AND WE WILL BE IN IT FOR THE 
NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. 
>> WALK ME THROUGH THE NEXT 
SEVERAL HOURS. 
THIS AFTERNOON, INTO THE 
EVENING, WHO IS AT RISK, WHAT 
WE NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR? 
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT, ALONG THE 
I, THIS AREA FROM PANAMA CITY 
UP TO I 10, THAT'S WHERE YOU 
ARE SEEING THOSE WINDS THAT 
WILL BE IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS 
OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. úBEYON 
SOME SERIOUS WIND GUSTS, 
POTENTIALLY APPROACHING 100 
MILES PER HOUR IN TALLAHASSEE,  
OFF TO THE WEST OF THAT, AND 
THEN INTO SOUTHWESTERN GEORGIA. 
IT'S POSSIBLE THIS STAYS AT IT 
-- AS A CATEGORY TWO PAST, 
ALMOST TOWARDS MACON, AND THE 
STORM CONTINUES TO MOVE OVER 
THE NIGHT, INTO THE MORNING, 
WHERE IT WILL BE INLAND FROM 
CHARLESTON AND SAVANNAH, THERE 
WILL BE GETTING SOME STORM 
SURGE AND WINS IN THE 50s AND 
60s, THE HEAVIEST RAIN WILL 
STAY OVER THE I 95 COURT OR. 
>> WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT FOR 
TOMORROW? 
>> FOR TOMORROW, THE STORM WILL 
CONTINUE TO MAKE ITS WAY NORTH, 
THAT WOULD BE INTO THE 
CAROLINAS, PLACES WHERE THEY 
SCARCELY NEED MORE RAIN AFTER 
HURRICANE FLORENCE, THEY COULD 
BE SEEING ANOTHER THREE, FOUR, 
SIX, EIGHT INCH DEPENDING ON 
WHERE THEY ARE IN LOCALIZED 
AREAS. 
SOME OF THE RIVERS STILL 
HAVEN'T COME DOWN. 
BY FRIDAY MORNING, THIS STORM 
IS ALREADY OFF THE COAST, AND 
BECOMES EXTRATROPICAL, WE COULD 
BE SEEING WIND GUSTS IN THE NEW 
YORK AREA, BUT FOR ALL INTENTS 
AND PURPOSES, ONCE THE STORE 
MAKES IT PAST NORFOLK, THE 
DANGER IS DONE, BUT BY NO MEANS 
IS THE THREAT DONE IN THE 
INLAND AREAS, WHERE TORNADOES 
CONTINUE TO BE A THREAT THROUGH 
THE NIGHT INTO TOMORROW. 
>> THEY ARE SAYING MICHAEL 
COULD BE ONE OF THE WORST IN 
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. 
>> MICHAEL ALREADY IS, IN TERMS 
OF, LET'S BREAK IT DOWN 
CHRONOLOGICALLY. 
SINCE 1960, WHICH IS THE 
SATELLITE ERA, WE'VE ONLY HAD 
TWO MAKE LANDFALL WITH HIGHER 
WIND SPEEDS. 
THAT WOULD BE CAMILLE AND 
ANDREW. 
WE'VE ONLY HAD ONE STORM, 
CAMILLE, WITH A STRONGER 
STRENGTH CENTRAL PRESSURE. 
THIS STORM, IN TERMS OF THE 
DEEPNESS OF THE CENTRAL 
PRESSURE, IS STRONGER, THINK 
KATRINA, STRONGER THAN ANDREW. 
THAT SHOULD SHOW YOU HOW 
RAREFIED THE AIR IT IS, IT WAS 
TWO MILES PER HOUR AWAY FROM 
THE CAT FIVE, THE DEVASTATION 
IN TERMS OF ROOMS RIPPED OFF IN 
TERMS OF CARS TOPPLED OVER, WE 
ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SEE 
THAT QUICKLY, WE MIGHT EVEN SEE 
SOME OF THE REAL 1st PICTURES 
OF  DAMAGE SURVEYS BEFORE THE 
NIGHT TO NIGHT. 
BY NO MEANS SHOULD YOU BE GOING 
OUT THE SURVEY, OR TO LOOK 
UNTIL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IN 
YOUR AREA SAYS IT'S SAFE. 
>> WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING AT 
THIS POINT? 
>> A COUPLE THINGS THAT I'M 
WATCHING. 
THE 1st THING IS  WHEN IS THIS 
THING GOING TO WEAKEN. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL WAS 
INTENSIFYING ALL THE WAY UP TO 
LANDFALL, IT GOT 155 AT ITS 
LANDFALL POINT, AND HONESTLY, 
IT WOULD HAVE MADE IT TO 
CATEGORY FIVE IF IT HAD ANOTHER 
HOUR. 
THE QUESTION IS, HOW FAR INLAND 
DO WE SEE THOSE WINS INTO THE 
60s, 70s, 80s, 100S, BECAUSE 
ONCE YOU ARE ABOVE 60, THAT'S 
ALL YOU NEED TO START TAKING 
DOWN TREES, AND WE WILL BE 
SEEING INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF 
POWER OUTAGES, AND YOU WILL BE 
SEEING PEOPLE WHO WILL BE 
WITHOUT POWER FOR DAYS INTO 
WEEKS, JUST BECAUSE THERE'S 
GOING TO BE SO MANY TREES DOWN. 
THE TREES ARE VERY TALL, THEY 
HAVE LARGE CANOPIES, THEY ARE 
EASILY WEIGHTED DOWN, SO IT 
WILL BE A LONG AND EXHAUSTIVE 
CLEANUP IN THE INLAND AREAS, 
NOT TO MENTION AT THE COAST, 
BOTH IN MEXICO BEACH AND IN 
PANAMA CITY, AND PANAMA CITY 
BEACH, WHERE THE HEAVIEST 
DAMAGE WILL HAVE OCCURRED. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
JOINING US. 
JOINING ME NOW BY PHONE, SARAH 
CANNON, WHO LIVES IN DESTIN, 
FLORIDA, HOW BAD ARE THE 
CONDITIONS WHERE YOU ARE NOW? 
>> RIGHT NOW, I AM LOOKING 
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, IN FRONT OF 
MY HOUSE, WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE 
A STRONG WIND THAT IS COMING IN 
FROM THE NORTH, THE PALM TREES 
ARE SWAYING ALL THE WAY OVER, 
TIPPING OVER, WE SEE THE TREES 
REALLY RUSTLING IN THE WIND AND 
THE RAIN IS BLOWING SIDEWAYS AT 
THIS POINT. 
WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF DAMAGE 
YET, THANKFULLY, BUT THE WIND 
IS JUST NOW PICKING UP WHERE WE 
ARE LOCATED. 
I'M TOLD BY THE COUNTY 
OFFICIALS HERE THAT WE SHOULD 
EXPECT SUSTAINED WINDS OF 50 TO 
60 MILES PER HOUR, WITH GUSTS 
UP TO 70.  
NOT QUITE HURRICANE STRENGTH, 
BUT DEFINITELY TROPICAL STORM 
STRENGTH. 
>> WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING, WHAT 
ARE OFFICIALS SAYING OVER THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS AT THIS POINT? 
>> THE OFFICIALS HERE IN WHERE 
WE ARE LOCATED HERE IN DESTIN 
HAVE DONE AN AMAZING JOB AT 
COMMUNICATING WITH ALL OF US, 
LOCALLY, THEY HAVE TOLD US TO 
EXPECT THE WORST BETWEEN NOW 
AND 5 PM CENTRAL STANDARD TIME, 
WE ARE NOT QUITE OUT OF THE 
WOODS, THEY DID SAY THAT WE 
SHOULD EXPECT THE POWER TO GO 
OUT AT SOME POINT, DAVE SAID 
THEY DO HAVE CREWS STANDING BY, 
WAITING TO GO OUT TO FIX THE 
POWER, AND THEY'VE ALSO 
EMPHASIZED ALL OF US DO NOT GET 
OUT ON THE STREET AND -- UNLESS 
IT'S AN EMERGENCY, KEEP THE 
ROADS CLEAR FOR ANY 1st 
RESPONDERS THAT NEED TO GO OUT 
TO HELP OTHERS.  
>> HOW CONCERNED ARE OFFICIALS, 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT OVER THE 
NEXT 24 TO 48 HOURS, PEOPLE 
GETTING SUPPLIES, GETTING GAS, 
BEING ABLE TO GET BACK ON THEIR 
FEET, WHAT ARE THEY SAYING, 
WHAT TO EXPECT, ARE THEY ASKING 
PEOPLE TO STAY HUNKERED DOWN? 
>> BASICALLY, RIGHT NOW, THE 
LOCAL OFFICIALS HAVE SAID 
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE 
UNLESS, UNTIL WE GIVE YOU THE 
CLEAR. 
THEY SAID IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT ALL EMERGENCY 1st 
RESPONDERS, THE POWER FOLKS,  
THE GULF POWER PEOPLE ARE ABLE 
TO GET OUT ONTO THE ROADS TO 
MAKE SURE THE POWER IS RESTORED.
CERTAIN AREAS WITHOUT POWER, MY 
HOME, THANKFULLY, HASN'T LOST 
IT YET, AND I WAS TELLING THE 
PRODUCER, DOWN HERE IN FLORIDA, 
IT'S STILL VERY HOT, 
TEMPERATURES ARE STILL IN THE 
MID-90s, WITH HUMIDITY THAT IS 
EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH. 
WHEN THE POWER GOES OUT, IT 
WILL BE VERY MISERABLE. 
THEY TOLD US FOR THE NEXT 36 TO 
48 HOURS, UNLESS IT'S AN 
EMERGENCY, PLEASE DON'T GO OUT, 
OR UNLESS THEY GIVE YOU THE 
CLEAR, THEY WANT TIME FOR THE 
OFFICIALS TO ASSESS DAMAGE, 
REMOVE TREES THAT MAY HAVE 
FALLEN OVER THE ROADS, AND ON 
THESE LOW-LYING LEVELS THAT ARE 
CLOSE TO THE OCEAN, YOU WILL 
SEE A LOT OF FLOODING, AND WE 
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THOSE 
FLOODWATERS RECEDED AS WELL. 
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FLORIDA, 
AND THE DIFFERENT AREAS THAT 
CAN FLOOD EASIER, WHERE YOU ARE 
AT, TELL US ABOUT DESTIN, THAT 
AREA IN FLORIDA. 
IS IS A CONCERN FOR OFFICIALS 
AS WE CONTINUE WITH THESE 
INCREDIBLE HURRICANES YEAR 
AFTER YEAR? 
>> DESTIN, FLORIDA, IRONICALLY, 
WE HAVE NOT SEEN A DIRECT HIT 
OF THE HURRICANE HERE, IN WELL 
OVER A DECADE. 
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD, 
I'M A NEWER RESIDENT, I JUST 
MOVED HERE WITHIN THE LAST 
YEAR, SO I CAN'T SPEAK FROM 
EXPERIENCE ON THAT. 
I CAN SAY WHAT OTHERS HAVE TOLD 
ME IS THAT, TYPICALLY, DESTIN 
HAS A WEATHER DOME WHERE THE 
WEATHER JUST GOES BY IT. 
FOR US TO EVEN BE GETTING A 
TROPICAL STORM RIGHT NOW IS 
SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL, ALTHOUGH NOT 
COMPLETELY OUT OF THE REALM OF 
POSSIBILITY. 
AS FAR AS THE OFFICIALS, I AM 
JUST A LOCAL, I CAN'T SPEAK FOR 
THEM, BUT I CAN SAY WHAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN TELLING US, THEY'VE 
DONE A GREAT JOB OF 
COMMUNICATING WITH EVERYONE TO 
TELL US, THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED 
TO DO TO BE PREPARED, THIS IS 
HOW YOU SHOULD EXPECT TO 
COMMUNICATE WITH FAMILIES AND 
RELATIVES AND LOVED ONES. 
SOME ZONES IN MY COUNTY WERE 
GIVEN A MANDATORY EVACUATION 
ORDER, BECAUSE THEY WERE IN LOW-
LYING LEVELS THAT WERE 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE STORM SURGE, 
AND FLOODWATERS, OR THE RAIN 
INCREASING THE FLOOD AROUND 
THEM. 
THEY DID SAY MAKE SURE YOU GUYS 
GET OUT AND GO FIND A SAFE 
PLACE TO BE, HOWEVER, I THINK 
THAT WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW, 
JUST WITH MY HOUSE, WE ARE 
GRATEFUL, WE ARE VERY PRAYERFUL 
THAT WE WILL BE OKAY, AND THE 
WORST THAT WILL HAPPEN TO US 
WILL BE THE POWER GOING OUT. 
ABSOLUTELY, AND CERTAINLY, OUR 
HEARTS AND THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS 
ARE WITH ALL OF THOSE IN PANAMA 
CITY, AND FURTHER ON EAST. 
WE KNOW THEY ARE REALLY GETTING 
THE BRUNT OF THIS. 
>> THEY CERTAINLY ARE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING 
US. 
FROM DESTIN, FLORIDA. 
JOINING ME NOW, WE HAVE ON THE 
PHONE JONATHAN McNAMARA, A 
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE 
RED CROSS IN TALLAHASSEE. 
WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN 
RIGHT NOW? 
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE CONCERNED 
WITH PEOPLE NOT LISTENING TO 
THE WARNINGS FROM LOCAL 
OFFICIALS. 
I AM LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW 
HERE AT OUR HEADQUARTERS, AND 
CONDITIONS HAVE DETERIORATED 
RAPIDLY. 
IF YOU HAVEN'T LEFT TO GO TO AN 
EMERGENCY SHELTER, IT'S 
IMPORTANT THAT YOU LISTEN TO 
LOCAL OFFICIALS, STAIN YOUR 
HOME, PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE 
BETWEEN YOU AND THE OUTSIDE OF 
YOUR HOME AS POSSIBLE. 
GO INTO AN INTERIOR CLOSET, AN 
INTERIOR BATHROOM, TO SO THAT 
YOU ARE NOT BY WINDOWS, SO THAT 
ANY DEBRIS OR THINGS CAN'T COME 
INTO DAMAGE YOU OR INJURE YOUR 
FAMILY. 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU HEED 
THOSE WARNINGS. 
>> AT THIS POINT, FOR FOLKS 
HUNKERING DOWN, WE ARE SEEING 
IMAGES FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH, 
INCREDIBLE THE WAY PALM TREES 
ARE SWAYING IN THE WIND. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU, ONCE THIS 
MAKES LANDFALL, AND THEN YOU 
DEAL WITH A SITUATIO DAYS 
LATER, HOW DOES THE RED CROSS 
RESPOND? 
WHAT YOU NEED, HOW CAN PEOPLE 
HELP? 
>> WE HAVE 500 DISASTER WORKERS 
 
AND THEY ARE FOCUSED ON 
PROVIDING SHELTER. 
OVER THE DAYS TO COME, ONCE 
CONDITIONS ARE SAFE, WE WILL 
SEND THEM INTO THE 
NEIGHBORHOODS, GO NEIGHBORHOOD 
BY NEIGHBORHOOD ASSESSING 
DAMAGE, AND PROVIDING FOOD, THE 
TYPES OF SERVICES THAT YOU 
EXPECT FROM THE RED CROSS, ALSO 
PROVIDING SHELTER TO 
INDIVIDUALS WHOSE HOMES MAY BE 
DAMAGED DURING THE STORM. 
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR VIEWERS 
TO DOWNLOAD OUR APP THAT WILL 
HAVE THE FULL SHELTERS THAT ARE 
AVAILABLE AFTER THE STORM, AS 
WELL AS CHECKING THE WEBSITES 
FOR YOUR LOCALITY FOR SPECIFIC 
INFORMATION ABOUT SHELTERS, PET 
SHELTERS, AND OTHER LOCATIONS 
THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HELP 
YOU STAY SAFE. 
AS ALWAYS, THE GENEROSITY OF 
YOUR VIEWERS, IF YOU WOULD LIKE 
TO MAKE A DONATION, VISIT RED 
CROSS.ORG, OR TEXT MICHAEL TO 
90999, AND THAT WILL ALLOW YOU 
TO MAKE A $10 DONATION. 
ONE LAST THING, AMPLIFY THE 
MESSAGES ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND 
IT IS FROM THE RED CROSS, BUT 
FROM OTHER LOCAL EMERGENCY 
RESPONDERS WERE PUTTING OUT 
CRITICAL SOCIAL MEDIA, GET 
SAFETY INFORMATION, IF YOU SEE 
THAT, RETREATED, REPOSTED, THE 
MORE PEOPLE THAT CAN ACCESS 
THAT INFORMATION, THE MORE 
PEOPLE WILL BE SAFE. 
>> WITH THE AMERICAN RED CROSS 
IN TALLAHASSEE, I HOPE YOU AND 
THE CREW STAY SAFE. 
TAKE CARE, WE ARE GRATEFUL YOU 
COULD JOIN US. 
AS WE GO TO BREAK, WE WANT TO 
BRING YOU SOME NEWS FROM WALL 
STREET, THE DOW IS CURRENTLY 
DOWN MORE THAN 500 POINTS. 
IT WAS DOWN CLOSE TO 600 
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. 
ANALYSTS SAY THE SELLOFF COMES 
AMID FEARS OF RISING U.S. 
TREASURY YIELDS AND CAN TURN 
THAT MY CONCERNS OVER THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S TRADE POLICIES.
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE 
STORE FOR YOU AND BRING YOU THE 
LATEST ON MICHAEL WHEN WE 
RETURN. 
>>> JOINING US NOW FROM 
FLORIDA'S CAPITAL, CBS NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT MANUEL, CAN YOU 
GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT YOU ARE 
SEEING THERE? 
>> WE ARE IN DOWNTOWN 
TALLAHASSEE, THE TREES AT THE 
CITY -- THAT THE CITY IS FAMOUS 
FOR, AND THE SPANISH MOSS 
BEHIND ME, ARE STARTING TO TELL 
THE STORY. 
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU GET 
A GOOD GUST COMING THROUGH 
HERE, AND IT ALL GETS GOING. 
WE ARE ALREADY GETTING REPORTS 
OF POWER OUTAGES IN THE 
TALLAHASSEE AREA, WE SPOKE WITH 
THE MUNICIPAL POWER COMPANY 
EARLIER TODAY, THEY TOLD US 
THEY USUALLY HAVE ABOUT 120 
PEOPLE WORKING, TODAY THEY HAVE 
600 PEOPLE STANDING BY. 
THAT'S JUST THE MUNICIPAL 
COMPANY, TRYING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THEY CAN KEEP THE LIGHTS 
ON. 
THERE ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
MASSIVE POWER OUTAGES HERE, AS 
HURRICANE MICHAEL MAKES ITS WAY 
ASHORE, THEN FURTHER INLAND. 
REMEMBER, ALTHOUGH THE MAJOR 
IMPACTS OF THE STORM RIGHT NOW 
ARE HAPPENING ALONG THE COAST, 
THE INLAND AREAS ARE GOING TO 
ALSO GET THOSE HURRICANE FORCE 
WINDS, INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
WE WON'T BE STANDING BY THOSE 
TREES IN A FEW HOURS WHEN THAT 
HURRICANE COMES THROUGH HERE, 
EXPECTED TO BE IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING 
HOURS, SHELTERS ARE OPEN, WE 
ARE SEEING NOT MANY PEOPLE OUT 
AND ABOUT, WHICH IS A GOOD 
THING, THAT WIND IS STARTING TO 
PICK UP, IT REALLY EBBS AND 
FLOWS, PRETTY SOON IT WILL 
START TO BE CONSISTENT, LIKE WE 
ARE SEEING FROM OUR COLLEAGUES 
REPORTS ALONG THE COAST. 
>> THE REPORTS WE ARE SEEING ON 
THE IMAGES FROM OUR COLLEAGUES, 
NICOLE KILLIAN IN PANAMA CITY, 
TREMENDOUS. 
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING THE POINT 
OF IMPACT, WHEN ARE YOU HEARING 
THAT IT WILL TOUCH DOWN AND 
AFFECT WHERE YOU ARE THERE IN 
TALLAHASSEE? 
>> WHAT WE ARE HEARING IS THAT 
BY THIS AFTERNOON, LATE 
AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING, 
THAT IS WHEN CONDITIONS ARE 
REALLY GOING TO START TO 
DETERIORATE. 
I WILL GO BACK TO THIS POINT, 
THE BIG CONCERN HERE IS CLEARLY 
NOT GOING TO BE COASTAL 
FLOODING, OR STORM SURGE. 
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS. 
SO MANY TREES HERE, AND ANY OF 
THEM THAT ARE OLD OR DYING, OR 
SIMPLY CANNOT HANDLE THE 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS, WILL 
LOSE BRANCHES AND TREES THEY 
ARE EXPECTED TO COME DOWN ON 
THE HOMES, ONTO BUILDINGS, 
WHICH COULD CAUSE INJURY OR 
DEATH, THAT IS WHY THEY ARE 
WANTING TO GET PEOPLE INTO 
SHELTERS AWAY FROM TREES, BUT 
ALSO THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE 
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE POWER 
OUTAGES THAT ARE EXPECTED 
THROUGHOUT THIS AREA. 
IT WILL BE A ROUGH LATE 
AFTERNOON TO EVENING FOR THE 
TALLAHASSEE AREA, THEN IT MOVES 
OUT OF HERE, AND WE TAKE A LOOK 
AT WHAT DAMAGE LEFT BEHIND. 
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT AS FAR 
AS POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE 
WINDS START TO GET CONSISTENT, 
AT 35 MILES PER HOUR,  AND WE 
MAY BE THERE VERY SOON, THAT IS 
WHEN THE POWER COMPANY SAYS 
IT'S NO LONGER SAFE FOR OTHER 
CREWS TO BE OUT AND ABOUT, 
TRYING TO RESTORE WHATEVER 
POWERLINES MAY HAVE BEEN 
KNOCKED DOWN EARLY IN THE 
STORM. 
THEY WON'T BE DOING THAT 
ANYMORE, SO IT MAY NOT BE UNTIL 
TOMORROW WHEN THEY GET DAYLIGHT 
AND THE WINDS HAVE PASSED 
THROUGH THIS AREA THAT THEY ARE 
FINALLY ABLE TO START CLEARING 
TREES AND TRYING TO RESTORE 
POWER. THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES 
WHEN IT COMES TO RESTORING 
POWER, THE HOSPITALS, THE 
NURSING HOMES, THE ASSISTED 
LIVING FACILITIES, THOSE ARE 
THE ONES THEY WILL TRY TO GET 
BACK ONLINE 1st, CLEARLY, FOR 
OBVIOUS REASONS. 
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 
THE POWER THE MOST , AND THE 
MOST QUICKLY. 
IT WILL BE A ROUGH GOING HERE 
IN TALLAHASSEE AS WE ARE 
STARTING TO SEE THOSE REPORTS 
FROM THE COAST, AND A SLIGHTLY 
WEAKER VERSION OF MICHAEL 
BEGINS TO MAKE ITS WAY HERE 
INTO THE STATES CAPITAL. 
>> YOU LIVE IN MIAMI, YOU KNOW 
ABOUT HURRICANE COVERAGE AND 
PREPARATIN. 
I'M CURIOUS, THE FOLKS YOU HAVE 
SPOKEN TO, WHAT ARE THE STORES 
LIKE THERE, THE GAS LINES, WHAT 
HAVE PEOPLE DONE TO PREPARE AT 
THIS POINT? 
WHAT DO PEOPLE ADVISE YOU TO DO 
WHEN YOU KNOW THIS IS COMING? 
>> Reporter: WE GOT HERE, AND 
AS YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LAND IN 
THIS AREA BEFORE A DISASTER, 
YOU GO LOOK FOR WATER FOR YOUR 
CREW, THEN FOR YOURSELF, AND 
IMMEDIATELY THE 1st WALMART I 
WENT TO WAS OUT OF BREAD, OUT 
OF WATER. 
PEOPLE DID PREPARE, THERE WERE 
GAS LINES, WE ARE NOT SEEING 
MANY OF THOSE NOW  COME UP 
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE GAS 
STATIONS HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP 
UP THEIR PUMPS, HOPING TO SAVE 
THEM FROM ANY WATER DAMAGE. 
AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE HEARD 
THE OFFICIAL SAY IT OVER AND 
OVER, IF YOU ARE NO LONGER 
PREPARED, OR IF YOU ARE STILL 
TRYING TO PREPARE, THE TIME IS 
UP HERE RIGHT NOW, BRACE FOR 
IT, HUNKER DOWN, GET INDOORS, 
TO THE INNERMOST PART OF ANY 
BUILDING, YOU MENTIONED THE 
LESSONS LEARNED FROM LIVING IN 
SOUTH FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY AFTER 
IRMA LAST YEAR, YOU RECALL 
THERE WAS THAT HORRIBLE 
INCIDENT AT A NURSING HOME 
WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER THE 
POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOR DAYS, 
AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 
THE POWER BACK INTO THE 
BUILDING. 
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 
GENERATOR, THERE'S A NEW LAW 
HERE IN FLORIDA THAT IS AIMING 
TO PREVENT THAT KIND OF A 
TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. 
AND REQUIRING ALL NURSING HOMES 
AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES 
TO HAVE GENERATORS, BUT AFTER 
THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 1 PAST, 
NUMBERS SHOW THAT A LOT OF 
THOSE FACILITIES, ESPECIALLY IN 
THE AREA, DON'T HAVE THOSE 
INSTALLED YET. 
FOR MANY REASONS. 
ZONING REGULATIONS, THERE'S A 
LABOR SHORTAGE, AND A SHORTAGE 
OF THOSE SUPPLIES, BUT THEY 
STILL HAVE TO PROVE THEY CAN 
KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE, AND THAT 
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS 
LOOKING VERY CLOSELY INTO, AND 
THAT'S WHERE THE POWER 
COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO 
PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS, TO 
PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE THAT FROM 
HAPPENING AGAIN. 
AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE TREES 
COME UP THEY REALLY GET GOING, 
AND THAT IS WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S 
STARTING TO BECOME MORE 
CONSISTENT, IT'S NO LONGER ONCE 
EVERY 10 MINUTES, IT'S STARTING 
TO BECOME MORE OF A REGULAR 
FLOW THROUGH, SO CLEARLY, 
MICHAEL IS GETTING CLOSER. 
>> YOU CAN PREDICT THAT JUST BY 
LOOKING AT THE TREES, THANK YOU 
SO MUCH, PLEASE STAY SAFE, WE 
WILL CHECK IN WITH YOU AND THE 
CREW THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON, 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO COVERAGE 
FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE, 
WC TV, FOR MORE ON THE STORM. 
>> THE SAME THING DOWN AT 
TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE, ALL 
THESE WEATHER STATIONS AFFECTED 
BY THE WEATHER, AND/OR THE 
POWER OUTAGES. 
REGARDLESS, WE KNOW THAT THE 
MOST INTENSE WINDS ARE RIGHT 
HERE, MOVING INTO JACKSON 
COUNTY, AND OVER THE 
NORTHEASTERN PARTS OF CALHOUN 
COUNTY, AND EVEN ACROSS THE 
RIVER INTO NORTHWESTERN PARTS 
OF LIBERTY COUNTY. 
BRISTOL, GETTING SOME OF THE 
STRONGEST WINDS YOU WILL SEE 
WITH THIS SYSTEM, MOVING UP 
INTO THE EASTERN PARTS OF 
JACKSON COUNTY, AND THAT ALSO 
MEANS THAT, FROM QUINCY OVER 
TOWARDS SNEADS AND 
CHATTAHOOCHEE, LAKE SEMINOLE, 
THESE ARE ALL AREAS THAT YOU 
COULD SEE THOSE WINS, AND 
EASILY GUSTS EXCEEDING 75 MILES 
PER HOUR,  EVEN SUSTAINED, WE 
COULD SEE 50 TO 60, 75 MILES 
PER HOUR WINDS SUSTAINED FOR A 
SHORT TIME  AS THE CORE MOVES 
BY. 
I'VE BEEN SAMPLING THE WINDS, 
IT'S A FEW MINUTES OWN, THIS 
SHOWS THAT SOME OF THE WINDS 
THAT I SAMPLED INTO JACKSON 
COUNTY WERE 83 MILES PER HOUR, 
THAT IS LIKELY  ELEVATED A 
LITTLE BIT, BUT I WOULDN'T BE 
SURPRISED IF WE SEE SOME GUSTS 
AT LEAST AS STRONG TOWARD THE 
SURFACE, GETTING CLOSE TO 
MARIANNA, AS YOU GET DOWN TO 
CENTRAL CALHOUN COUNTY, 
MEASURING THE VELOCITY AT 87 
MILES PER HOUR, AND BACK INTO 
BAY COUNTY,  IT'S GETTING 
LIGHTER, BUT STILL 85 MILES PER 
HOUR.  
NEAR THAT CORE, YOU'RE GOING TO 
SEE 85 TO 100 MILES PER HOUR 
WINDS  THE WITH THE POSSIBILITY 
FOR HIGHER GUSTS. 
IT WILL GET WEAKER, BUT IT'S 
NOT WEAK. 
IT WILL STILL BE A MAJOR IMPACT 
MAKER THROUGHOUT JACKSON 
COUNTY, MOVING INTO SEMINOLE 
COUNTY, VERY CLOSE THERE, AND 
UP THROUGH PARTS OF MILLER, AND 
THE LOWER WESTERN PARTS OF 
DECATUR COUNTY, WE COULD SEE 
WIND GUSTS WELL IN EXCESS OF 75 
MILES PER HOUR . THEN, THEY 
START TO DROP OFF QUICKLY, ONCE 
YOU GET FARTHER AWAY FROM THAT 
CORE. 
PUTTING THIS INTO MOTION, YOU 
HAVE A BETTER IDEA THAT IT'S 
MOVING ALONG NOW, YOU CAN SEE 
THAT THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE I 
IS NOW MOVING INTO JACKSON 
COUNTY, YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE 
INTENSE BANDS THAT ARE ALL THE 
WAY OUT TOWARDS THE EAST, THEY 
DO GET LIGHTER IN INTENSITY, AS 
YOU GET TOWARD THE SUWANEE 
RIVER VALLEY, BUT STILL SOME 
AREAS HAVE PICKED UP 1 TO 3 
INCHES OF RAIN, AND WE STILL 
HAVE A TORNADO THREAT 
REGIONWIDE. 
WE'VE SEEN A FEW WARNINGS FOR 
THESE CELLS THAT MOVED UP 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE 
PENINSULA, MOVING TOWARD WEST 
OF JACKSONVILLE, WEST OF DUVAL 
COUNTY, BUT SO FAR, WE HAVE NOT 
SEEN THOSE ROTATING STORMS HERE 
REGARDLESS OF THE TORNADO 
WATCH, BECAUSE OF THE 
POTENTIAL, THAT GOES TO 5:00, 
PROBABLY ABOUT 10:00 TONIGHT, 
AND THEN EXTREME WIND WARNINGS 
FOR THAT AREA OF INTENSE WINDS 
RIGHT NEAR THAT CENTER OF THE 
EYE OF MICHAEL AS IT MOVES OFF 
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST. 
FROM JACKSON COUNTY, SEMINAL 
WESTERN DECATUR, NORTHWESTERN 
PARTS OF GETZEN COUNTY, WESTERN 
PARTS OF LIBERTY COUNTY. 
HERE'S A SATELLITE VIEW, YOU 
CAN WATCH THAT CORE OF THE 
STORM AS IT MOVES ASHORE, I'VE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE DRY AIR, 
THERE IT IS. 
IT'S GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER, 
I BELIEVE SOME OF THIS IS 
LIKELY STARTING TO GET SUCKED 
AROUND THE SOUTH SIDE OF THAT. 
THAT'S WHY THE RAIN HAS STARTED 
TO FALL APART, ONCE WE GET 
OFFSHORE. 
ALL OF THIS STUFF IS ASSOCIATED 
WITH THAT STRONG TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE IN THE UPPER LEVELS, 
AND THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT, 
WHICH WILL MAKE OUR WEATHER A 
LOT NICER, AND EXACTLY WHAT WE 
NEED, WHICH IS COOLER AND DRIER.
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN 
IMMEDIATELY TOMORROW, TOMORROW 
WE ARE GOING TO BE WARM AND 
HUMID, AND BY THE TIME WE GET 
TO TOMORROW NIGHT AND INTO 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY, THAT IS 
WHAT WE GET TO THE COOLER AND 
DRIER, RAINFALL AMOUNTS, THE 
AREAS IN BLUE IS YOUR SOLID 1 
TO 3 INCH AMOUNTS, THIS IS A 
RADAR ESTIMATE, IT ALMOST 
ALWAYS DOES THESE NUMBERS IN 
TIMES OF TROPICAL RAINS, THEY 
SWITCHED THE MODES TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THAT, BUT SOME OF THE 
RAINFALL RATES ARE SO INTENSE 
THEY JUST CAN'T KEEP UP. 
DOWN TOWARD PANAMA CITY, AS 
MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL, THAT IS 
WHERE WE SEE THAT 6 TO 8 INCHES 
OF RAINFALL SO FAR, AND THIS IS 
WHAT HAS FALLEN SO FAR. 
FLASH FLOODING IS STILL AN 
ISSUE OFFICIALLY, TALLAHASSEE 
HAS PICKED UP 2.9 INCHES OF 
RAINFALL, ONE POINT -- KEEP IN 
MIND, NOT GETTING THE WEATHER 
DATA ANYMORE FROM APALACHICOLA, 
OR ANY DATA FROM MARIANNA, THE 
LAST REPORT, 1.62 INCHES OF 
RAINFALL, THAT WILL DOUBLE OR 
TRIPLE EASILY AS THE EYEWALL 
GETS CLOSER TO YOU. 
HEADED DOWN, NOT LITERALLY, BUT 
FIGURATIVELY HEADING DOWN 
TOWARD THE COAST, KEEPING AN 
EYE ON THE APPROACHING HIGH 
TIDES FOR APALACHICOLA, RIGHT 
AT HIGH TIDE RIGHT NOW IN ST. 
MARK'S, THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS 
IN PARTICULAR WE ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT FOR SURGE, IT HAS SOME OF 
THE HIGHEST POTENTIAL STORM 
SURGE OF ANYWHERE ALONG THE 
U.S. COAST, BECAUSE OF THE 
SHAPE OF THE BAY, BECAUSE OF THE
SHALLOW CONTINENTAL SHELF, AND 
BECAUSE OF THE TERRAIN THERE, 
THE WATER JUST KEEPS GETTING 
PUSHED UP FARTHER AND FARTHER. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS AREA. 
AT THE TOP OF THIS CONCAVE 
SHAPE OF APPALACHIA BAY, BUT 
REGARDLESS, ALL THE WATER THAT 
HAS BEEN PUSHED UP FROM THE 
GULF OF MEXICO HAS GOTTEN UP IN 
THAT BAY AND NOW HAS NOWHERE TO 
GO, AND THE WIND KEEPS PUSHING 
IT. 
THE WATER WILL CONTINUE TO RISE 
THROUGHOUT FRANKLIN COUNTY, WE 
HAD A REPORT OF SURGE REPORTS 
NEAR ALLIGATOR POINT OF 10 
FEET, THAT IS NOT SURPRISING AT 
ALL. 
TO BE HONEST, THIS 12 FEET MAY 
BE TOO LOW FOR AREAS AROUND ST. 
MARK'S AND SOUTHEASTERN PARTS 
OF THE COUNTY, WE COULD SEE 13 
TO 14 FEET, AND THE SURGE IS 
ALSO A SERIOUS LIFE-THREATENING 
SITUATION THROUGHOUT PARTS OF 
COASTAL TAYLOR COUNTY. 
HERE ARE THE CURRENT WINDS, NOW 
WE SEE SUSTAINED WINDS IN 
TALLAHASSEE ABOVE TROPICAL 
STORM FORCE AT 41. 
THE REST OF THE AREA, GENERALLY 
SPEAKING, THE WINDS AREN'T SO 
BAD, KEEP IN MIND, WE ARE 
MISSING STATIONS NOW DUE TO THE 
PROBLEMS THAT COME WITH A 
TROPICAL SYSTEM. 
UNFORTUNATELY, LOOK AT THE WIND 
GUSTS, THERE IS THAT MOST 
RECENT WIND GUSTS, 71 MILES PER 
HOUR,  I'VE HEARD THE WIND HERE 
AT OUR STATION, WHICH WAS NEAR 
THE FLYOVER, IN TALLAHASSEE, I 
COULD FEEL THE BUILDING SHAKING 
WITH SOME OF THE GUSTS WITHIN 
THE LAST 20 MINUTES. 
LIKELY SOME OF THOSE GUSTS HAVE 
EXCEEDED 70 MILES PER HOUR.  
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS 
TALLAHASSEE, WHICH IS A FAIR 
DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE CORE OF 
THE STRONGEST WINDS, WHICH ARE 
STILL BACK OVER CALHOUN AND 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
THAT SHOWS YOU THAT 30 TO 40 
MILES AWAY FROM THE CORE, YOU 
ARE GOING TO SEE THOSE WIND 
GUSTS, THAT WILL BE NEAR OR 
EXCEED HURRICANE FORCE, 
EXCEEDING 75 MILES PER HOUR.  
THOSE TYPES OF WINDS ARE VERY 
LIKELY ACROSS PARTS OF 
SOUTHWEST GEORGIA, THIS 
EVENING, WHAT THE FUTURE CAST, 
THIS GOES OUT ROUGHLY AN HOUR 
OR SO TO START, AND IT SHOWS 50 
OR 60 MILES PER HOUR WINDS FROM 
TALLAHASSEE, UP INTO SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA,  WHILE NOT AS STRONG, 
STILL SUSTAINED WINDS NEAR 
TROPICAL STORM -- 
>> YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO WC 
TV, WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A 
QUICK BREAK NOW, BUT BEFORE WE 
DO, WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW 
ABOUT AN EXCITING CHANGE COMING 
TO CBSN, BEGINNING ON MONDAY, 
OCTOBER 15, WE ARE ADDING A NEW 
HOUR OF LIVE COVERAGE TO OUR 
LINEUP, BEGINNING AT 7 AM 
EASTERN TIME. 
WE WILL HELP YOU GET A HEAD 
START ON YOUR DAY BY BRINGING 
YOU THE LATEST NEWS FROM AROUND 
THE WORLD WITH OUR GLOBAL TEAM 
OF CORRESPONDENCE. 
WE WILL ALSO DIG DEEP INTO THE 
STORIES THAT MATTER MOST TO YOU
, WITH WELL RESEARCHED, 
UNBIASED INSIGHT AND 
PERSPECTIVE. 
DON'T MISS US MONDAY MORNING AT 
SEVEN EASTERN FOR THE ALL NEW 
CBSN A.M. 
>>> WE WANT TO TURN OUT THE 
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE 
AFFILIATE, WCTV FOR MORE ON THE 
STORM. 
>> WITH TULSA BACK OVER TO THE 
NEW SIDE, BACK AGAIN IN JUST A 
LITTLE BIT. 
>> THANKS. 
WE HEARD THOSE WINDS RATTLING 
THE CEILING. 
>> YOU COULD REALLY FEEL THE 
BUILDING SHUTTERING WORK 
>> LIKE IT WAS BREATHING. 
IT WAS TOUGH IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES, WE KNOW IT'S PICKING 
UP HERE IN TALLAHASSEE, AND 
LEON COUNTY AS WE SPEAK, AND 
THE POWER OUTAGE NUMBERS ARE 
GOING UP AS WELL PICK 
>> THE LATEST NUMBERS WE HAVE, 
44,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER IN 
TALLAHASSEE, ANOTHER 35,000 
WITHOUT POWER AS WELL. 
ALSO, WE HAD A VIEWER SEND A 
PHOTO, WE WANT YOU TO TAKE A 
LOOK, THIS IS DAMAGE AT THE 
HOME ON TALLAHASSEE THAT IS ON 
THE WEST SIDE OF THE CITY, I 
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS UNDER A 
CARPORT, OR IF THAT IS WHAT IS 
LEFT OF THEIR GARAGE, WHILE. 
>> EITHER WAY, IT'S TOUGH DAMAGE
, GOING TO DIG MAJOR CLEANUP 
AND A MAJOR INSURANCE CLAIM, I 
WOULD HOPE, AND I WOULD THINK. 
THIS JUST REMINDS ME OF THAT 
SITUATION, HOW MANY TREES AND 
POWER LINES WE HAD DOWN, AND 
THE SORT OF THING WHERE THE 
TREES WERE COMING DOWN LEFT AND 
RIGHT ON HOMES. 
>> AND ON CARS. 
>> WE HOPE YOU ARE ALL SAFE, I 
WANTED TO MENTION, THE CITY OF 
TALLAHASSEE HAS REQUESTED ONE-
TO-ONE NATIONAL GUARDSMEN TO 
HELP IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS 
STORM. 
THAT GIVES YOU SOME IDEA HOW 
WIDESPREAD THE DAMAGE IS, AND 
COULD BE. 
>> THERE OBVIOUSLY PREPARING 
FOR THE WORST, ALICIA TURNER IS 
MONITORING THINGS IN 
TALLAHASSEE FOR US. 
SHE IS LIVE DOWNTOWN RIGHT NOW, 
HOW ARE YOU DOING, IT LOOKS 
WINDY. 
>> JULIAN, IT IS WINDY, THESE 
GUSTS ARE PICKING UP EVERY 
COUPLE OF MINUTES, AND I WAS 
HIT BY THE DOOR AS I WAS TRYING 
TO GET OUT ONTO THE BALCONY, 
BECAUSE THE WIND GUSTS WERE 
COMING. 
I'M OKAY, BUT IT GOES TO SHOW 
YOU HOW QUICKLY THOSE WIND 
GUSTS CAN HAPPEN, AND IT CAN 
ALMOST KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET. 
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK BEHIND ME, 
YOU CAN SEE JUST HOW THAT RAIN 
IS COMING IN SIDEWAYS RIGHT 
NOW, AND YOU CAN GET A GOOD IDEA
, ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT RAINING 
HARD, THAT WIND IS DEFINITELY 
COMING THROUGH IN THE AREA NOW, 
SINCE I'VE BEEN OUT HERE, WE 
HAVE HEARD LOTS OF 
TRANSFORMERS, THERE ARE QUITE A 
FEW PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER, AND 
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY 
THERE'S A LOT OF DEBRIS 
EVERYWHERE, SO MAKE SURE YOU 
WANT TO AVOID THOSE AREAS, AS 
FAR AS THE WIND GUSTS GO, YOU 
CAN'T EVER KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING 
TO HAPPEN, AND THAT'S ONE OF 
THE MAIN REASONS YOU WANT TO 
REMAIN INDOORS. 
THAT WIND CAN COME, AND IT CAN 
KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET JUST 
LIKE IT'S DOING FOR ME, AND 
MICHAEL RIGHT NOW. 
IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE 
THINGS WHERE IT COMES AND GOES, 
AND IT CAN GET REALLY INTENSE. 
FOR RIGHT NOW, THE RAIN IS 
LIGHTER THAN WHAT IT WAS 
EARLIER, THIS AFTERNOON, AND IT 
HASN'T REALLY PICKED UP TOO 
MUCH, BUT THE WIND CERTAINLY 
HAS. 
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT CAN COME AND 
GO, AND THAT IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
DEALING WITH OUT HERE. 
FOR NOW, I'LL SEND IT BACK TO 
YOU IN THE STUDIO. 
>> STAY SAFE, AND PUT THIS IN 
PERSPECTIVE, WE ARE GETTING 
WINDS AND GUSTS 50, 70 MILES 
PER HOUR  HERE, THIS STORM HAS 
WINDS TOPPING 100 MILES PER 
HOUR,  HOW POWERFUL THAT THESE 
WINDS ARE AS THEY ARE COMING TO 
TALLAHASSEE, EVEN THIS MANY 
MILES FROM THE COAST. 
>> WE ARE A GOOD DISTANCE FROM 
THE CENTER OF THE STORM, SO 
THAT'S WHY WE REALLY WORRY 
ABOUT THE FOLKS OVER IN MEXICO 
BEACH, AND PANAMA CITY, AND 
THAT AREA, AND AS THE STORM 
TRACKS THROUGH SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA AND BEYOND, AND 
EXTENSIVE REIGN OF DAMAGE THAT 
IS GOING TO CAUSE IN THOSE 
AREAS. 
WHERE WE GOING NEXT? 
LET'S GO TO EMMA WHEELER IN 
CAIRO, SHE'S AT THE SHELTER 
SEEKING THE PATH OF THE STORM 
AS IT MAKES THE BAND TOWARD THE 
RIGHT AS IT MOVES INLAND, IT 
WILL GO RIGHT OVER SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA SO THEY ARE PREPARING, 
AND HUNKERED DOWN THERE, AND 
EMMA IS STANDING BY IN A 
SHELTER THERE. 
>> THIS FAMILY WORSHIP CENTER 
IS OPENING ITS DOORS FOR THE 
STORM. 
NEARLY 100 PEOPLE CALLING THIS 
PLACE HOME FOR WHO KNOWS HOW 
LONG. 
ONE THING THAT PEOPLE DO KNOW 
IS THAT THEY ARE GLAD THEY MADE 
THEIR DECISION TO LEAVE HOME, 
AND THEY ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE 
SPACE. 
A FULL ROOM, SAFE FROM THE 
STORM. 
>> WE COME HERE JUST TO BE ON 
THE SAFE SIDE, WE DON'T WANT TO 
TAKE ANY CHANCES. 
>> DOZEN STICKING CENTER AT THE 
FAMILY WORSHIP CENTER. 
>> MANY THAT CAME IN WERE 
CRYING, THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT 
THEY WERE GOING TO DO. 
>> Reporter: THE CHURCH OPENED 
DOORS ALMOST EVERY HURRICANE, 
READY FOR WHATEVER COMES. 
>> YOU NEED TO PREPARE FOR THE 
WORST. 
WE ARE HOPING FOR THE BEST, BUT 
YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED, YOU 
GOT TO BE WISE. 
>> Reporter: SERVING LUNCH AND 
COMFORT AT A TIME MANY PEOPLE 
NEEDED. 
>> WE'VE BEEN SCARED, BUT 
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE OKAY. 
>> Reporter: WAITING IT OUT, 
HOPING FOR A QUICK RETURN HOME. 
FAMILY WORSHIP CENTER IS 
PROVIDING PRIVATE ROOMS FOR 
ANYONE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS, THEY 
ARE ALSO PROVIDING MEALS, 
COFFEE, WATER, ANYTHING TO HELP 
MAKE THIS SPACE COMFORTABLE, 
ORGANIZERS SAY THEY WILL BE 
OPEN UNTIL THE STORM PASSES 
THROUGH. 
EMMA WHEELER, WCTV, EYEWITNESS 
NEWS. 
>> I THINK THIS REALLY SPEAKS 
TO THE INTENSITY OF THE STORM, 
AND HOW QUICKLY IT'S 
STRENGTHENED OVER THE LAST THEY 
WERE SO. 
PEOPLE WHO WOULD SAY I WILL 
WAIT IT OUT, WE WILL BE FINE AT 
HOME, HAVE DECIDED NO, I LIVE 
IN A LAND OF TREES HERE, THIS 
IS MORE THAN I AM READY FOR, 
AND THEY ARE SEEKING SHELTER AS 
ABBY MENTIONED WHEN SHE WAS 
TALKING TO FOLKS THERE, A LOT 
OF PEOPLE CAME FROM THAT 
NEIGHBORHOOD, THE COMMUNITY 
NEAR COLOGNE, SAYING THEY HAD 
TOO MANY TREES AROUND THEIR 
PROPERTY, AND THEY WERE AFRAID 
OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN. 
>> WE LOVE THE CANOPY, IT 
SHIELDS US FROM THE HOT SUMMER 
SUNSHINE, AND IT IS BEAUTIFUL, 
MOST OF THE TIME, BUT WHEN A 
STORM IS ROLLING THROUGH, YOU 
DON'T WANT TO BE UNDERNEATH ALL 
THOSE TALL TREES, AND YOU WANT 
TO TAKE SHELTER FOR SURE. 
>> SINCE I MOVED HERE, MORE 
THAN 25 YEARS AGO, IT'S ALWAYS 
BEEN TALK ABOUT HURRICANE KATE, 
WERE YOU HERE FOR KATE? 
THEY TELL STORIES OF HOW KATE 
CAME INTO THIS TOWN AND KNOCKED 
OUT POWER FOR WEEKS, AND 
DAMAGED SO MANY BUSINESSES, AND 
HOMES, SO THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING 
THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR 
THE LAST 25 YEARS OR SO. 
I'M AFRAID THAT HURRICANE 
MICHAEL IS GOING TO FALL IN THE 
SAME CATEGORY, WHERE YOU WERE 
YOU HERE WHEN MICHAEL CAME 
THROUGH? 
AND SEE THE DAMAGE THAT IT DID 
TO THE CITY. 
ON ITS PATH. 
>> THIS IS, MICHAEL CAME ASHORE 
SO FAR TO THE WEST OF US, 
AROUND THE BEND FROM US, IN THE 
PANAMA CITY AREA, AND LOOK AT 
THE DAMAGE IT'S DOING RIGHT 
HERE, FOR US, THE WIDTH AND 
BREADTH OF THE STORM,  AND THE 
STRENGTH OF THOSE WINDS,  IT 
WILL BE SOMETIME THAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT MICHAEL AND THE 
IMPACTS, LENNY IS STANDING BY 
AT A SHELTER IN TALLAHASSEE, 
SHE JOINS US ON THE PHONE, SHE 
IS AT GODBY HIGH SCHOOL, WHAT 
CAN YOU TELL US? 
>> Reporter: YOU GUYS JUST GOT 
THROUGH TALKING ABOUT HOW 
STRONG THE WINDS ARE RIGHT NOW, 
AND I REALIZED THE CHILL A FEW 
MOMENTS AGO, BECAUSE I'M INSIDE 
THE SHELTER WITH 300 PEOPLE WHO 
ARE SEEKING SHELTER HERE, BUT I 
JUST CAME OUTSIDE, I HAD TO GET 
SOMETHING OUT OF THE CAR, AND 
I'M SITTING IN THE CAR, WE GOT 
TO A POINT WHERE I ALMOST FELT 
LIKE THE CAR WAS ABOUT TO LIFT 
UP OFF THE GROUND AND TAKE ME 
AWAY, I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW 
SERIOUS IT WAS, BECAUSE HERE AT 
THE SHELTER, THEY ARE INSIDE, 
AND THEY ARE MAKE SURE THAT 
THEY STAY SAFE ME THEY SAY THEY 
DO FEEL SAFE AT THIS LOCATION, 
MANY WERE SKEPTICAL ABOUT GOING 
TO THE SHELTER, BUT REALIZING, 
1st OF ALL, IT'S NOT AS BAD AS 
THEY THOUGHT IT WAS, AND 
SECONDLY,  THAT IT IS NEEDED. 
THEY ARE GLAD THAT IT IS HERE, 
AT LAST CHECK, THE OFFICIAL 
NUMBER THAT I GOT WAS 301, BUT 
IT'S BEEN ABOUT AN HOUR SINCE I 
GOT AN OFFICIAL NUMBER, SO AT 
LEAST 300 PEOPLE HERE, SIGNED 
UP, AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, 
THIS IS NEAR CAPACITY FOR THIS 
FACILITY. 
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING IN, 
THEY'RE JUST GRATEFUL TO HAVE 
SOMEWHERE TO GO. 
A LOT OF KIDS ARE HERE AT THIS 
SHELTER, A LOT OF FAMILIES, 
EVERYONE IS HERE, AND 
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE GOING 
WELL, AND THEY ARE JUST 
GRATEFUL, THEY JUST CAN'T WAIT 
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, THEY KNOW 
THAT THEY ARE SAFE HERE AT THIS 
HIGH SCHOOL. 
>> LET ME SHOW -- YOU MENTIONED 
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THERE, DID 
YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE WERE COMING
IN THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS, 
MYBE MAKING LAST-MINUTE 
DECISIONS TO SEEK SHELTER? 
>> Reporter: YES, THAT'S WHAT 
IT SEEMS LIKE. 
ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS TOLD ME 
THAT IT WAS ABOUT HALF THIS 
NUMBER WHEN SHE LEFT AT 
MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT. 
>> AS WE GET IT DOESN'T GO TO 
BREAK, WE WANT TO BRING YOU AN 
UPDATE FROM WALL STREET, THE 
DOW IS CURRENTLY DOWN MORE THAN 
800 POINTS, ANALYSTS SAY 
INVESTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
RISING INTEREST RATES,  THIS IS 
THE 1st TIME THE DOW HAS DIPPED 
BELOW 26,000 IN A MONTH, WE 
WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS FOR 
YOU, AND BRING YOU THE LATEST  
ON HURRICANE MICHAEL AS WELL 
WHEN WE RETURN. 
>>> ON THE "CBS EVENING NEWS," 
FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE, 
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY. 
>> AT 12 NOON, HIGH TIDE ROLLED 
IN. 
>> RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T TELL 
THE RIVERS FROM THE ROADS. 
>> THIS IS A MASSIVE OAK TREE 
THAT WAS TOPPLED. 
>> FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES, 
THEY ARE HOPING THAT THEY STILL 
HAVE HOMES TO RETURN TO. 
>> THIS IS THE WORST IT HAS 
EVER BEEN. 
>> THIS IS SCARY. 
>> THIS IS SOME OF THE WORST OF 
FLORENCE. 
>>> HELLO, EVERYONE, I'M TANYA 
RIVERO. 
WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AS THE 
MARKETS START TO CLOSE, THE DOW 
IS DOWN MORE THAN 800 POINTS. 
IT'S BOUNCING AROUND A LITTLE 
BIT BUT THIS IS THE LOWEST IT 
HAS BEEN SINCE APRIL.  
>>> AND, HURRICANE MICHAEL IS 
NOW MOVING THROUGH THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. 
THE CATASTROPHIC CATEGORY FOUR 
STORM IS POUNDING PANAMA CITY 
WITH HEAVY RAIN AND DESTRUCTIVE 
WINDS. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL HAS ALREADY 
KNOCKED OUT POWER FOR MORE THAN 
173,000 CUSTOMERS,  OFFICIALS 
FEEL -- FEAR BUILDINGS 
CONSTRUCTED BEFORE 2001 WILL 
NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE 
POWERFUL WINDS. 
MICHAEL IS BEING DESCRIBED AS 
THE STRONGEST STORMS TO HIT THE 
FLORIDA PANHANDLE IN DECADES. 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS ARE IN 
EFFECT FOR 30 MILLION PEOPLE 
FROM FLORIDA'S GULF COAST, ALL 
THE WAY TO NORTH CAROLINA. 
TODAY, FEMA WARNED IT'S TOO 
LATE FOR PEOPLE IN THE PATH OF 
THE STORM TO EVACUATE. 
>> THE WINDOW TO EVACUATE HAS 
COME TO A CLOSE. 
I MEAN, ONCE, YOU KNOW -- IN 
SOME CASES ON THESE BARRIER 
ISLANDS, THEY HAVE TO SHUT DOWN 
DRAWBRIDGE IS AT CERTAIN 
SUSTAINED WINDS. 
AND QUITE HONESTLY, THE OCEAN 
HAS ALREADY STARTED RISING, AND 
SOME OF THOSE AREAS 
ANTICIPATING THE STORM SURGE. 
AS I SAID, THE MOST IMPORTANT 
THING IS THAT YOU ARE IN AN 
AREA AND CAN'T GET OUT OF THAT 
AREA, TRY TO GET ELEVATED AND 
TO A FACILITY YOU THINK CAN 
WITHSTAND THE WIND. 
>> CBS NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER 
DAVID PARKINSON JOINS US NOW. 
WHAT IS THE LATEST YOU CAN TELL 
US? 
WE KNOW MICHAEL HAS MADE 
LANDFALL. 
WHAT MORE CAN YOU TELL US? 
>> THE STORM HAS REMAINED 
RELATIVELY INTACT AS IT CROSSES 
INTERSTATE 10 WHICH IS NOT 
RIGHT AT THE COAST. 
SO, THE STORM IS REALLY GOING 
TO START BEING AN IMPACTFUL 
INLAND WINDSTORM AS WELL. 
PERHAPS LONGER THAN WE WERE 
ANTICIPATING. 
SO, AS WE GO INTO THE LATE-
NIGHT HOURS, YOU WILL PROBABLY 
BE SEEING SOME DAMAGING WINDS 
INTO CENTRAL GEORGIA. 
>> HOW UNUSUAL IS THAT? 
>> IT'S PRETTY RARE. 
NOW, KEEP IN MIND, THE STORM 
WAS INTENSIFYING UP UNTIL 
LANDFALL, OVER A SWAMPY AREA. 
SO, IT'S NOT TOTALLY UNHEARD-
OF. 
BUT ONCE YOU HIT LANDFALL, THE 
STORM IS SUPPOSED TO START, YOU 
KNOW, FALLING APART. 
YOU CAN SEE ON THAT RADAR RIGHT 
THERE, YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THE 
WELL-DEFINED EYE ON THE STORM 
AND IT'S NOT WEAKENING THAT 
CONSIDERABLY. 
SO, THAT'S SOMETHING TO NOTE.  
AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S 
GOING TO TAKE DOWN TREES FOR 
POWER OUTAGES, IT ONLY TAKES 60 
OR 70 MILES AN HOUR. 
ANYWHERE WHERE YOU ARE SEEING 
THE BRIGHT ORANGE, EVEN PARTS 
OF THE YELLOW BANDS, YOU COULD 
BE EASILY SEEN WINDS OF THAT 
SPEED. 
>> SO IS IT CONTINUING TO MOVE 
INLAND AS A CATEGORY FOUR 
STORM? 
>> YEAH, IT IS. 
IT HAS NOT YET COME DOWN FROM A 
CATEGORY FOUR SO WINDS WOULD 
NEED TO DROP BELOW 130 MILES AN 
HOUR TO DO THAT.  
WE HAVE BEEN AT 155, DOWN TO 
150. 
WE WILL PROBABLY GET ANOTHER 
UPDATE THAT WILL TAKE IT INTO 
THE 140S. 
>> SO THEN, ARE OFFICIALS 
WORRYING THAT IT'S MOVING INTO 
AREAS WHERE THE BUILDINGS HAVE 
NOT BEEN PREPARED FOR THIS? 
>> YEAH. 
THE KEY THING TO REMEMBER HERE 
IS THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE 
WIND SPEED OF 140 OR 130 OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT'S A 
VERY, VERY NARROW AREA. 
ONLY 10 MILES FROM THE CENTER 
OF THE STORM. 
SO, IT'S A WIDESPREAD DEAL. 
HURRICANE FORCE WIND AREA, AND 
A MUCH SMALLER AREA OF THOSE 
REALLY SERIOUS WINDS. 
BUT, YEAH. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 
EXPECTING A STORM OF THIS 
INTENSITY. 
AND I MIGHT ADD IT'S A LITTLE 
BIT FASTER, TOO. 
WE WERE THINKING THAT PERHAPS 
TALLAHASSEE MIGHT BE GETTING 
HIT SOMETIMES WHEN THE EVENING 
NEWS IS USUALLY ON. 
IT'S STARTING TO GET IMPACTED 
RIGHT NOW. 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT AHEAD OF 
SCHEDULE, IT'S A LITTLE BIT 
FASTER. 
THAT MEANS AS IT CONTINUES ITS 
MARCH INTO THE CAROLINAS, IT 
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE AS FAR AS 
COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA BY 
TOMORROW MORNING AT SUNRISE, 
WHICH IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN 
WE WERE EXPECTING AS WELL. 
>> ARE WE EXPECTING WIDESPREAD 
DAMAGE? 
WE WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT 
HOW HURRICANE ANDREW SET THE 
STANDARD THAT ALL BUILDINGS HAD 
TO MEET A CATEGORY THREE 
STANDARD THAT THEY COULD 
WITHSTAND CATEGORY THREE, BUT 
NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT CATEGORY 
FOUR, AND OF COURSE THERE WERE 
PLENTY OF BUILDINGS THAT WERE 
NOT UPGRADED TO THE STANDARD. 
WHAT KIND OF DESTRUCTION ARE WE 
EXPECTING? 
>> IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE IN 
MIAMI, THEY HAVE PREPARED FOR 
THAT, AFTER ANDREW, KEEPING IN 
MIND THAT THIS PART OF FLORIDA 
HAS NEVER HAD A STORM THIS 
STRONG WERE EVEN CLOSE TO THIS 
STRONG. 
WE'VE BEAT THE PREVIOUS RECORD 
IN THAT AREA BY 30 MILES AN 
HOUR. 
SO, THEY'VE NEVER HAD A 
CATEGORY FOUR. 
THEY'VE NEVER HAD MUCH OF A 
STRONG CATEGORY THREE. 
SO, THERE IS NO INSTITUTIONAL 
MEMORY IN THAT REGARD.  
THE KEY THING TO NOTE HERE IS 
AS WE GO INLAND, A LOT OF THE 
TREES CAN COME DOWN BECAUSE 
THEY ARE VERY LARGE, THEY ARE 
VERY TOP-HEAVY. 
THERE IS A LOT OF POWER LINES 
THAT ARE GOING TO COME DOWN. 
BUT IN TERMS OF THAT ANDREW 
LIKE DEVASTATION, THE CARS 
TIPPED OVER, THE ROOFS RIPPED 
OFF, THE ABSOLUTE AND COMPLETE 
DEVASTATION OF PROPERTY, THAT 
IS GOING TO BE LIMITED TO 
MEXICO BEACH AND PANAMA CITY 
BEACH, ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY. 
>> WHY IS THAT? 
>> BECAUSE THAT'S RIGHT WHERE 
YOU HAVE THOSE 155 MILE AN HOUR 
WINDS, AND THE EYE WALL RIGHT 
WHERE IT CAME ON. 
IT'S WEAKENING AS IT GOES 
FURTHER INLAND. 
THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT 
GOING TO CAUSE LOTS OF DAMAGE.  
IT'S NOT GOING TO RIP OFF 
ROOFS. 
BUT, THE UTTER DEVASTATION OF 
BLOCKS, LIKE YOU SAW IN ANDREW, 
THAT'S GOING TO BE LIMITED. 
>> WE HAVE SEEN SOME IMAGES OF 
MEXICO BEACH WITH ROOFS THAT 
HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED, AND 
FLOODING THAT IS ALREADY OVER 
SEVERAL STORIES HIGH. 
>> RIGHT. 
AND SO THE KEY THING WITH STORM 
SURGE IS THE NEXT HIGH TIDE 
CYCLE IS NOT UNTIL 6 P.M. 
CENTRAL TIME. 
SO, EVEN IF THE SEARCH STARTS 
TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT AS THE 
STORE MAKES ITS WAY FURTHER 
INLAND, UNFORTUNATELY, THE 
FLODDING THREAT IS NOT REALLY 
GOING TO RELAX ITSELF UNTIL YOU 
GET TO THE NIGHT. 
IN A LOT OF PLACES, YOU ARE 
GOING TO START TO BE ABLE TO 
SURVEY SOME DAMAGE, IF LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SAY IT'S OKAY. 
TONIGHT, AND CERTAINLY BY 
TOMORROW, THE WINDS WILL BE 
BELOW THE THRESHOLD TO CLOSE 
THE BRIDGES. 
BUT, SO MANY ROADS ARE GOING TO 
BE COVERED IN DEBRIS. 
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE SAFE TO BE 
WALKING OR DRIVING AROUND, EVEN 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY 
ABOUT THE WIND THREATS. 
PLEASE LISTEN TO LOCAL 
OFFICIALS ON THAT. 
>> SO SCARY. 
I REALLY AM WORRIED ABOUT FOLKS 
THERE BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE 
A LOT OF TIME TO PREPARE ON 
THIS ONE. 
>> NO. 
AND I REALLY HOPE THAT PEOPLE 
HEEDED WARNINGS WHEN THEY WERE 
THERE. 
LOOKS, THIS STORM EXCEEDED 
EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS BUT 
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO TAKE 
EVERY HURRICANE SERIOUSLY.  
BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW IF IT'S 
GOING TO HAVE A KICK IN THAT 
LAST BIT. 
YOU WOULD ALWAYS RATHER 
EVACUATE AND BE SAFE THAN HAVE 
NOT EVACUATED AND NEED HELP. 
CLEARLY, IF YOU SAW THOSE 
PICTURES, NOBODY WAS GOING TO 
HELP YOU WHEN THE STORM WAS AT 
ITS WORST. 
>> INDEED. 
DAVID PARKINSON, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE. 
I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE 
PENTAGON WHERE WE ARE GETTING 
AN UPDATE ON THE FEDERAL 
RESPONSE TO THE STORM. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> SUPPORTED BY AREA, FUEL, 
CAPABILITY, AND SWIFT WATER 
RESCUE BOATS, THROUGHOUT 
IMMEDIATE LIFESAVING SUPPORT 
FOR HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
THIS IS INDEED A COLLABORATIVE 
EFFORT AND WE ARE INTEGRATING 
WITH THE U.S. COAST GUARD AS 
THE LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY. 
THE COAST GUARD IS DIRECTED BY 
THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND 
SECURITY FOR DISASTER RESPONSE 
AND WHILE WE ARE DIFFERENT 
DEPARTMENTS, LET THERE BE NO 
DOUBT THAT WE ARE FULLY 
INTEGRATED TOGETHER. 
AND WE GIVE A COUPLE OF OTHER 
EXAMPLES OF OUR DOD SUPPORT. 
OUR ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS 
SAYS ANY PERSONNEL DEPLOYED TO 
THE AREA ALREADY. 
THEY HAVE ALSO BE POSITIONED 55 
GENERATORS, AN ADDITIONAL 35 
GENERATORS ON THE WAY. 
OUR DEFENSE LOGISTICS AGENCY 
HAS PRE-POSITIONED FUEL 
SUPPLIES AT MAXWELL AIR FORCE 
BASE AND OTHER AREAS ALONG WITH 
145 ADDITIONAL GENERATORS. 
WE ALSO MAINTAINED C-17 PLANES 
ON ALERT ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL 
STRING THAT CAN APPLY ANY -- WE 
ALSO HAVE AERONAUTIC RESCUE 
TEAMS THAT CAN RESPOND IF WE 
NEED TO EVACUATE ANYONE OUT OF 
THE AREA. 
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE THESE 
EARLY RESPONSE FORCES 
PREPOSITIONED TO RESCUE 
CITIZENS IN NEED AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE AFTER THE STORM'S 
PASSAGE. 
FROM HELICOPTERS TO HIGH WATER 
VEHICLES, TO SWIFT WATER BOATS, 
WE ARE GOING TO FACILITATE 
TIMELY AND EFFECTIVE MILITARY 
RESPONSES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE 
AFTER RECEIPT OF FEMA MISSION 
ASSIGNMENTS. 
NOW I'D LIKE TO TAKE ANY 
QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT OUR 
PREPARATION. 
>> GENERAL BOB BURNS WITH AP. 
YOU MENTIONED TYNDALE. 
AND HE SAID THAT THE HOMELAND 
DEFENSE -- MY WORD -- 
>> AIR OPERATIONS CENTER. 
>> OKAY, AIR OPERATIONS CENTER, 
HAS BEEN MOVED. 
AT BOTH TYNDALE, ENGLAND, AND 
HURLBERT. 
HAVE YOU ESSENTIALLY EVACUATED 
THOSE AREAS? 
OR DO THEY STILL HAVE PRIORITY? 
>> LET ME START WITH THE AIR 
OPERATIONS CENTER' CAPABILITY. 
-- CAPACITY. 
WE LOOK ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL 
U.S., AND WE HAVE OTHER NOTES 
AND OTHER PLACES WHERE WE CAN 
ACTUALLY DO THE SAME COMMAND 
AND CONTROL MISSION SET, AND 
SEAMLESSLY TRANSITION IN. 
BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION, I 
CAN'T TELL YOU THE SPECIFIC 
BASE THAT IS TRANSFERRED TO BUT 
WE DID DO THAT LAST NIGHT. 
BEFORE THE STORM ARRIVED WE 
TRANSFER THAT COMMUNICATION 
CONTROL CAPABILITY TO ANOTHER 
FACILITY. 
WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL 
BASIS, EACH INDIVIDUAL 
INSTALLATION COMMANDER HAS 
GIVEN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO 
THEIR BASES, AND DEPENDING ON 
EXACTLY WHERE THEY WERE FOR 
EXAMPLE, TYNDALL, RIGHT IN THE 
PATH OF THE STORM, HAD  BOTH 
PERSONNEL AND FAMILIES 
ASSOCIATE, -- EVACUATE, WHERE 
OTHERS HAVE LESS EVACUATE. 
THAT IS UP TO THE LOCAL 
INSTALLATION COMMANDERS IN 
COORDINATION WITH LOCAL 
OFFICIALS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
GOVERNOR. 
>> WHAT DO THEY DO IN ENGLAND 
VERSUS HURLBURT? 
>>> HILLARY LANE JOINS US NOW 
FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH, 
FLORIDA. 
HI, HILLARY.  
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 
SEEING AND EXPERIENCING THERE? 
>> Reporter: TANYA, A VERY 
DIFFERENT SITE COMPARED TO 
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. 
THE WORST OF THE STORM HAS 
PASSED US. 
REALLY JUST SOME LIGHT RAIN 
NOW. 
AND THE PALM TREES I CAN SEE 
OVER MY SHOULDER ARE BLOWING. 
BUT BEFORE THAT AROUND NOON 
TODAY, THERE WAS WIND WHIPPING 
ACROSS. 
WE COULDN'T EVEN COME OUTSIDE 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE JUST TOO 
DANGEROUS. 
AS YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THIS 
ROOF WAS BLOWING IN THE WIND A 
LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY. 
IT POPPED OFF QUITE A BIT. 
YOU SEE STREET SIGNS IN THIS 
AREA, ON THE GROUND. 
SO MANY SIGNS HANGING ON A 
DIAGONAL. 
EARLIER TODAY, IT WAS A VERY, 
VERY SCARY SCENE. 
BUT AS IT PASSED THROUGH US, 
RIGHT NOW, MUCH, MUCH CALMER. 
>> AND THE AREA WHERE YOU ARE, 
IS IT PRETTY MUCH FULLY 
EVACUATED? 
>> YES. 
SO, MUCH OF THE AREA, WE WERE 
AT A HOTEL LAST NIGHT, AN 
EVACUATION ZONE. 
MANY PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH THERE 
WAS A MANDATORY EVACUATION 
AREA, DID NOT WANT TO LEAVE. 
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT REASONS. 
SOE HAD ELDERLY FAMILY 
MEMBERS, SOME JUST WANTED TO 
RIDE THE STORM OUT. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE, EVEN THOUGH 
THEY WERE IN THE MANDATORY 
EVACUATION AREAS, DECIDED 
TUESDAY. 
RIGHT HERE, WE ARE IN -- NOT IN 
A MANDATORY EVACUATION AREA, SO 
MORE PEOPLE ARE IN THIS AREA. 
>> WHAT IS THE WORST THAT YOU 
HAVE SEEN AND NOW THAT THE 
STORM HAS PASSED? 
IS IT MOSTLY FLOODING THAT 
PEOPLE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THERE? 
>> Reporter: I WOULD SAY THAT 
IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO DO, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT 
COMES TO TOMORROW, WHERE PEOPLE 
GO OUTSIDE AND BEGIN TO 
REBUILD. 
WE'VE SEEN QUITE A BIT OF 
DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES. 
WE ARE BEING TOLD, WE HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO SEE, SOME HOMES HAVE 
BEEN COMPLETELY LEVELED. 
ESPECIALLY SOME NEWER 
STRUCTURES. 
SO, WHEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
EVACUATED BEGIN TO COME BACK, 
THEY'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO 
QUITE A BIT THAT THEY ARE GOING 
TO NEED TO REBUILD. 
>> AND YOU KNOW, HILLARY, WE 
HEAR THAT THIS IS THE STRONGEST 
HURRICANE THAT HAVE MADE 
LANDFALL IN THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. 
WHAT ARE FOLKS THERE TELLING 
YOU ABOUT THIS? 
I MEAN, HAVE THEY JUST BEEN 
TERRIFIED THROUGH THIS 
EXPERIENCE? 
>> Reporter: YEAH. 
THEY SAY THIS IS ABSOLUTELY 
TERRIFYING. 
NOW, THE INTERESTING PART THAT 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS THAT THEY 
DID NOT HAVE TIME TO PREPARE. 
YOU KNOW WITH FLORENCE, 
PREDICTORS WERE SAYING, THIS IS 
GOING TO BE A STORM FOR A WEEK 
BUT PEOPLE WERE SAYING THEY DID 
NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. 
THEY WERE GETTING THE MANDATORY 
EVACUATION ORDERS THIS WEEKEND 
THAT'S WHEN THEY WERE FIRST 
WORKING ABOUT IT. 
I THINK WHAT PEOPLE WERE SAYING 
IS, FOR SUCH A POWERFUL, 
GIGANTIC STORM, THEY DIDN'T 
HAVE A LOT TO PREPARE. 
>> NO, INDY. 
THAT IS WHAT MADE IT SO SCARY 
FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. 
CERTAINLY, IT BUILDS STRENGTH 
MORE THAN ANYONE COULD. 
MORE QUICKLY THAN ANYONE COULD 
IMAGINE. 
HOW MANY HOMES DO YOU THINK 
THERE ARE WITHOUT POWER? 
ARE YOU SEEING A LOT OF POWER 
OUTAGES WHERE YOU ARE? 
>> Reporter: WE ARE. 
WE ARE HEARING THAT ULTIMATELY 
THERE IS GOING TO BE 150,000 TO 
200,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER IN 
THIS REGION. 
AT OUR HOTEL WHERE WE ARE 
STAYING, EVEN BEFORE THE WORST 
OF THE STORM CAME THROUGH, 
CERTAINLY, THIS WAS GOING TO BE 
A MAJOR ISSUE. 
WE HEARD FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR 
EARLIER TODAY SAYING, THE 
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO GET 
THE ELECTRICITY BACK ON. 
THAT'S QUITE CRUCIAL WHEN IT 
COMES TO REBUILDING. 
CERTAINLY, A LARGE NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE, UP TO 2000, WILL BE 
WITHOUT POWER. 
THAT'S GOING TO HINDER THE 
REBUILDING EFFORTS LATER THIS 
WEEK. 
>> HILLARY LANE, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE THERE. 
STAY SAFE. 
>>> LET'S TAKE YOU NOW BACK TO 
THE PENTAGON WHERE WE ARE 
GETTING AN UPDATE ON THE 
FEDERAL RESPONSE TO THIS STORM. 
ONCE AGAIN, LET'S LISTEN AND. 
>> QUICKLY GAINED IN INTENSITY. 
AND WE ARE NOT SEEING THE 
NUMBERS IN THE SHELTERS AND WE 
ARE NOT SEEING THE NUMBERS 
NECESSARILY GOING AWAY. 
SO, MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS, 
THERE IS MANY PEOPLE IN HOM'S 
WAY. 
THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO HAVE THE 
SEARCH AND RESCUE CAPABILITY. 
AND BESIDES THE HIGH WINDS AND 
OF COURSE WIND SPEED, EVERYONE 
IS SIMILAR WITH, THERE IS A 
SEARCH THAT IS GOING TO BE A 
WIDE FACTOR. 
AND IT'S A WIDESPREAD. 
OBVIOUSLY, RIGHT IN THE AREA OF 
TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE. 
AND, IT'S REALLY FROM 
PENSACOLA, ALL THE WAY DOWN 
THROUGH TAMPA, WHERE THERE WILL 
BE SOME IMPACT FROM THE SEARCH. 
THAT COMBINATION OF THE WIND, 
THE SURGE, THE LACK OF 
EVACUATIONS, HAS US CONCERNED. 
AND,  THAT'S WHY WE ARE SO WELL 
PREPARED TO RESPOND. 
>> THAT GETS TO MY FOLLOW-UP 
WHICH IS, YOU TALKED ABOUT 
SEARCH AND RESCUE. 
AT -- AS YOU HAVE PLANNED 
AGAINST THE STORM AND YOU DON'T 
SEE THE MASSIVE CIVILIAN 
EVACUATION THAT YOU WOULD HAVE 
WANTED TO SEE. 
WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING? 
WHAT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING, IN 
TERMS OF THE OVERALL FULL NEED 
FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE? 
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY 
PEOPLE, WHETHER IT'S YOU, OR 
LOCAL AUTHORITIES, OR WHOEVER, 
HOW MANY PEOPLE? 
>> I WILL SAY THAT FOR EXAMPLE, 
THE STATE OF FLORIDA IS VERY 
WELL-PREPARED. 
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS 
MANY TIMES. 
THEY HAVE INCREDIBLE 
CAPABILITY, CAPACITY. 
AND, QUITE FRANKLY, WE WOULD BE 
LESS CONCERNED, BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE SUCH ROBUST CAPABILITY. 
AND, WE SEE IT FROM THE FEDERAL 
SIDE, IN COORDINATION WITH 
FEMA. 
WE ARE IN DIRECT SUPPORT OF THE 
GOVERNORS, AND TRYING TO 
ANTICIPATE THEIR NEEDS. 
YOU CAN SEE, FROM THE REPORTS 
THAT HAVE BEEN OUT, THE 
GOVERNOR IS VERY CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE LACK OF EVACUATIONS. 
THEY HAVE THE ROBUST CAPABILITY 
AND CAPACITY. 
THEY VERY WELL ME -- MAY BE 
ABLE TO HANDLE THE CAPACITY. 
BUT, BECAUSE OF THAT, THAT'S 
WHY WE ARE POSTURED SO STRONGLY 
AND HAVE SUCH A ROBUST TEAM 
AROUND THE PERIMETER. 
>> DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE, 
PERHAPS, FROM, THE FEDERAL 
MILITARY SIDE, GIVEN THE 
CAPACITY YOU HAVE PUT AND HAVE 
ON STANDBY, WHAT COULD YOU 
ACCOMPLISH IN TERMS OF HOW MANY 
PEOPLE YOU COULD GET OUT OF 
HARM'S WAY? 
>> I DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE PUT 
THAT WAY. 
WHAT WE WOULD LOOK AT FOR MORE 
IS OUR ABILITY, AS WE LOOK AT 
BOTH THE LOCAL RESPONSE 
CAPABILITY, AND AS THE STORM 
COMES THROUGH, WE ARE GOING TO 
SEE THAT, UNLIKE FLORENCE, 
WHERE WE CAN SEE IT'S ALREADY 
MOVING THROUGH. 
AND SO, THE ACTUAL RECOVERY 
EFFORT I THINK WILL BE 
SIGNIFIANTLY DIFFERENT, I 
THINK. 
THAT'S WHY WE ARE POSTURED NOT 
ONLY WITH THE SEARCH AND RESCUE 
FROM THE AIR AND HELICOPTERS, 
BUT ALSO WITH THE GROUND 
VEHICLES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO 
COME IN. 
SO, I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR 
YOU, PER SE, BUT FROM A 
CAPACITY STANDPOINT, WE ARE 
BRINGING IN SIMILAR CAPABILITY 
CAPACITY THAT WE DID FOR 
FLORENCE, BUT, WHERE OUR FOCUS 
IS, BECAUSE OF THE FAST-MOVING 
NATURE OF THE STORM, WE THINK 
WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO IT BY 
LAND AS WELL. 
>> COURTNEY, THEN JEFF. 
>> FORGIVE ME IF I MISSED THIS. 
BUT, WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING 
THROUGH ALL OF THE ASSETS, YOU 
TALKED ABOUT PJ TEAMS TO THE 
WEST, AND SOME SWIFT WATER 
RESCUE BOATS. 
WHERE ARE THEY STATIONED? 
>> GULFPORT, MISSISSIPPI IS 
WHERE WE ARE PUTTING THEM. 
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE PATRICK 
AIR FORCE BASE FROM THE EAST 
SIDE. 
>> THERE ARE TWO TEAMS AT 
PATRICK AND MORE AT GULFPORT? 
>> RIGHT. 
AND THERE'S MORE FROM THE COAST 
GUARD STANDPOINT, I WILL USE AN 
EXAMPLE OF THE GRAY SYSTEM WE 
HAVE WITHIN THE NATIONAL GUARD, 
AS THEY FEEL THAT THEY NEED 
ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY, THEY ARE 
ABLE TO PUT OUT OTHER STATES, 
AND FIND ADDITIONAL 
CAPABILITIES. 
SO THERE IS FOR EXAMPLE, 15 
ADDITIONAL HELICOPTERS COMING 
IN FROM OTHER STATES TO SUPPORT 
FLORIDA, THAT WILL ALSO BE DOWN 
IN THE GULFPORT AREA. 
>> 15 ADDITIONAL NATIONAL GUARD 
HELICOPTERS. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> AND THEN, -- ACTUALLY, I 
THINK THAT WAS IT. 
OH, ONE OTHER THING. 
HUNTER AND FORT STEWART, THEY 
WILL HAVE ROTARY AND HIGH 
WATER. 
I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT, AND I KNOW I ASKED 
YOU THIS WITH THE FLORENCE 
BRIEFING, BUT ONE THING WE ARE 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS, WHERE 
IS THE FIRST THINGS THINGS ARE 
GOING TO BE COMING FROM? 
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHERE 
THE FIRST SEARCH AND RESCUE 
ASSETS WILL BE? 
I KNOW THAT'S HARD TO ANSWER. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BUT 
FRANKLY, THAT'S PART OF THE 
REASON WHY WE DO THE 
SURROUNDING PARTS. 
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S GOING 
TO PLAY OUT. 
IN THIS CASE WE THINK JUST 
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE STORM IS 
COMING, WE WILL BE ABLE TO COME 
IN FROM BEHIND. 
THAT'S WHY THE PATRICK FLOOR 
SITS THERE. 
WE WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
COME IN FROM THE SOUTH. 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE FEELING 
CAPABILITY AS WELL SO WE CAN 
TRAVERSE IN FROM THE GULF 
ITSELF. 
CLEARLY AS WE SEE THE TRACK 
THAT IS BETTER TO FIND IN THIS 
CASE AND IT WAS IN FLORENCE, WE 
WILL SEE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE 
TO COME IN FROM THE SOUTH AND 
THEN ULTIMATELY FROM THE WEST 
AND EAST ADDITIONALLY. 
>> NO ASSETS HAVE BEEN 
REQUESTED YET, RIGHT? 
EVERYTHING IS STILL BEING 
POSITIONED? 
>> FROM THE FEDERAL STANDPOINT, 
WITH RESPECT TO FEMA, OUR 
SEARCH AND RESCUE CAPABILITY 
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE NOW HAS 
NOT BEEN ACTIVATED TO BE PUT IN 
USE, YET. 
>> AT ME JUST ADD ONE THING TO 
THAT. 
THAT SAID, I WANT TO BE VERY 
CLEAR. 
ALL OF THE STATES, PARTICULARLY 
FLORIDA, THEY HAVE INCREDIBLY 
ROBUST CAPABILITIES FROM BOTH A 
VERTICAL LIFT, OR A HELICOPTER 
SEARCH AND RESCUE, HIGH WATER 
VEHICLES, AND THE NATIONAL 
GUARD, I WILL JUST GIVE AN 
EXAMPLE. 
WITHIN FLORIDA, THEY HAVE BEEN 
AUTHORIZED TO 3500 OF THEIR 
GUARDSMEN ARE AUTHORIZED TO BE 
ACTIVATED BY THE GOVERNOR. 
THEY HAVE ABOUT 2300 OF THEM 
THAT WERE IN POSITION AS THE 
STORM MADE LANDFALL. 
SO, THEY HAVE A VERY ROBUST 
NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE 
LITERALLY AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW 
THAT IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED. 
>> JEFF, AND THEN LOUIS. 
>> GENERAL JEFF. 
DO YOU HAVE A TOTAL NUMBER OF 
HOW MANY TITLE 10 PERSONNEL, 
AIRCRAFT, AND VEHICLES HAVE 
BEEN PRE-POSITIONED? 
>> I DO. 
AS WE SAID RIGHT NOW THIS WILL 
CHANGE OVER TIME DEPENDING ON 
DEMAND SIGNALS. 
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE 2600 ACTIVE-
DUTY PERSONNEL THAT HAVE BEEN 
PREPOSITIONED. 
THERE IS 32 ACTIVE HELICOPTERS. 
THERE ARE 240 ACTIVE-DUTY HIGH 
WATER VEHICLES. 
AND, 32 SWIFT WATER BOATS FROM 
THAT TITLE 10 OR ACTIVE-DUTY 
SIDE. 
BUT THAT NUMBER WILL CHANGE, 
LITERALLY, HOURLY, AS THE 
DEMAND SIGNAL COMES IN. 
AS WE SIT RIGHT NOW, THAT'S 
WHERE IT IS. 
>> FORGIVE A ROOKIE QUESTION, 
BUT, WHY DOES THERE NEED TO BE 
A FEDERAL RESPONSE, IF YOU 
MENTIONED FLORIDA HAS A ROBUST 
CAPABILITY, AND A LOT OF 
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN? 
WHY IS THERE A ROLE FOR THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HERE AT ALL? 
>> THANKS FOR ASKING THAT 
QUESTION. 
IT'S A PART OF A NATIONAL 
RESPONSE FRAMEWORK. 
BY DESIGN, IT STARTS WITH THE 
LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN THE LOCAL 
LEVEL RESPONSE. 
AND THEN BASED ON THE MAGNITUDE 
OF THOSE STORMS ARE SOMETIMES 
EXCEEDS THEIR CAPABILITY AND 
CAPACITY, THEREFORE WE HAVE THE 
FEDERAL SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT IS 
ABLE TO AUGMENT AND HELP THE 
STATES WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH 
THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY ARE 
FACED WITH. 
BUT, CLEARLY, THE INTENT IS 
THAT THE STATES IN THIS CASE, 
FLORIDA, GEORGIA FOR EXAMPLE, 
ARE GOING TO HANDLE THE INITIAL 
RESPOND. 
AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO 
AUGMENT IN COORDINATION WITH 
FEMA, THEIR CAPABILITIES. 
>> LOUIS, THEN SYLVIE. 
>> LOUIS MARTINEZ, ABC, SIR. 
IT HAS THE TAG IN FLORIDA, 
ACTIVE-DUTY, COMMANDER -- SO 
FAR? 
>> YES, THANKS FOR ASKING THAT. 
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH 
TANNER MAYBE 30 MINUTES AGO AND 
HE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED AS A DUAL 
SATUS COMMANDER WITHIN 
FLORIDA. 
THAT GIVES US A MINUTES 
OPPORTUNITY AS WE BRING OUR 
TITLE 10 FORCES IN, AND WE PUT 
THEM UNDER THE GENERAL, HE CAN 
ACTUALLY ALSO COMMAND THE GUARD 
FORCES. 
AND THAT PROMOTES A SYNERGY OF 
EFFORT THAT WE CAN BE IN LINE 
WITH, WITH EXACTLY WHAT THE 
GOVERNOR NEEDS AND WANTS US 
FOCUSED ON. 
AND SO, THAT HAS BEEN 
ACCOMPLISHED. 
THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SIGNED 
THAT YESTERDAY, ACTIVATED 
TODAY, AND THAT'S IN PLACE. 
>> HAVE THERE BEEN LESSONS 
LEARNED FROM FLORENCE JUST A 
MONTH AGO? 
BECAUSE, FROM OUR PEOPLE ON THE 
GROUND, WHEN THEY WERE THERE IN 
THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH THERE, 
THERE WAS A MISPERCEPTION FROM 
THE LOCAL POPULATION THAT THE 
U.S. MILITARY WOULD FLOOD THE 
ZONES, SO TO SPEAK, VERY 
QUICKLY. 
AND YET, THAT WASN'T THE CASE, 
BECAUSE THE STATE HAD ITS OWN 
PLAN FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. 
BUT, HOW DO YOU OVERCOME THE 
PERCEPTION THAT U.S. MILITARY 
SHOULD MOVE IN QUICKLY? 
>> I THINK THAT FLORENCE IS A 
GOOD EXAMPLE. 
WE DID IN FACT MOVE IN QUICKLY. 
WE HAD A FAIRLY ROBUST 
RESPONSE. 
BUT IN THIS CASE AGAIN, BOTH 
NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA DID A 
TREMENDOUS JOB, BOTH WITH THEIR 
LOCAL FORCES AND NATIONAL GUARD 
FORCE, UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF 
THE GOVERNOR. 
AND AS DESIGNED, THEY ARE THE 
FIRST RESPONDERS. 
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO DO THE 
INITIAL PART AND THEN WE ARE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. 
I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A COUPLE 
EXAMPLES. 
THE TITLE 10 FORCES HAVE 367 
SAVES THROUGHOUT FLORENCE. 
THAT MIGHT NOT BE IN THE 
BROADER SENSE. 
BUT, FROM THE OVERALL RESPONSE, 
THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE MEMBERS 
THAT WERE ACTUALLY SAVED. 
I'LL ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK 
THAT THE LOCAL INSTALLATIONS 
WERE ABLE TO DO TO WORK WITH 
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, TO BE ABLE 
TO DO THAT IMMEDIATE RESPONSE, 
AND HELP THE FIRST RESPONDERS 
WHEN THEY MOST NEEDED THAT 
HELP. 
AND I WILL SAY, HAVING 
PERSONALLY GONE DOWN THERE AND 
SEEN THE DEVASTATION AND 
RESPONSE OF BOTH THE TITLE 10 
AS GUARD FORCES, I THINK IT 
ACTUALLY WORKED AS IT'S 
DESIGNED TO DO. 
AND, QUITE EFFECTIVELY. 
>> SYLVIE, THEN LUCAS. 
>> I KNOW YOU CANNOT GIVE A LOT 
OF DATES ABOUT THE DURATIONS 
AND THE BASES, BUT, CAN YOU 
TELL US HOW MANY PLANES, FOR 
EXAMPLE, YOU HAD TO DISPLACE? 
OR, TELL US IF IT WAS SOMETHING
, NOT HABITUAL, NOT USUAL FOR 
YOU? 
>> AGAIN, SPECIFICALLY, TO THE 
INDIVIDUAL INSTALLATIONS AND 
THEIR RESPONSE TO IT, THAT'S 
UNDER THE INDIVIDUAL 
AUTHORITIES OF THE INSULATION 
COMMANDER AND SERVICES. 
WHAT WE ARE TIED TO IS BOTH, 
WHAT CAPABILITY DO WE NEED TO 
HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THE STATES 
AND AS FAR AS A NATIONAL 
RESPONSE AND, WHAT IS THE 
CAPABILITY WE NEED TO HAVE FOR 
ONGOING OPERATIONS AND HOW DO 
WE TRANSITION THAT TO A 
DIFFERENT LOCATION IF WE NEED 
TO FOR THE INSULATION? 
SPECIFICALLY TO HOW MANY 
AIRPLANES HAVE LEFT AND 
WHATNOT, I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER 
FOR YOU. 
>> LUCAS? 
>> ON SEPTEMBER 11th, THE 
RUSSIANS FLEW A PAIR OF NEW WE 
ARE CAPABLE BOMBERS OFF THE 
COAST OF ALASKA. 
HAVE THEY FLOWN ANY FLIGHTS 
LIKE THAT SINCE THEN? 
>> THANKS FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE 
FACT THAT IT REALLY HIT US AT 
NORTH, AND NORAD, BESIDES 
HAVING ROBUST RESPONSES TO THE 
HURRICANE. 
WE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON THE HOME 
AND DEFENSE MISSION, AND OUR 
ABILITY TO DETER. 
ESPECIALLY AS WE HAVE COME TO 
THIS SECURITY ENVIRONMENT THAT 
WE ARE IN TODAY, AND A MUCH 
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAN WE 
WERE IN JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. 
AND SO I THINK AS YOU SAW, WE 
HAD A ROBUST RESPONSE. 
>> WE BEEN LISTENING TO AIR 
FORCE GENERAL TERRENCE 
O'SHAUGHNESSY AT THE PENTAGON 
BRINGING US UP TO SPEED ON THE 
FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE 
MICHAEL.  
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK BUT BEFORE WE DO, WE WANT 
TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT AN 
EXCITING CHANGE COMING TO CBSN. 
BEGINNING ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 
15th,  WE ARE ADDING A NEW HOUR 
OF LIVE COVERAGE TO OUR LINE OF 
BEGINNING AT 7 A.M. 
EASTERN. 
ANNE-MARIE GREEN AND  VLADIMIR 
DUTHIERS WILL HELP BRING YOU 
NEWS AROUND THE WORLD WITH OUR 
GLOBAL TEAM CORRESPONDENCE. 
WE WILL DIG DEEP INTO THE 
STORIES THAT MATTER MOST TO YOU 
WITH WELL RESEARCHED, UNBIASED 
INSIGHTS AND PERSPECTIVE. 
DON'T MISS ANNE-MARIE AND VLAD 
MONDAY MORNING AT 7:00 EASTERN, 
FOR THE ALL-NEW CBSN A.M.  
>>> THE DOW FELL MORE THAN 800 
POINTS TODAY.  
ANALYSTS SAY INVESTORS ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT RISING INTEREST 
RATES. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE DOW 
HAS DIPPED BELOW 26,000 IN A 
MONTH AND THE LOWEST IT HAS 
BEEN SINCE APRIL.  
FOR MORE, THE STREET TV 
CORRESPONDENT, SCOTT GAM, JOINS 
ME NOW ON THE PHONE. 
SCOTT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING 
WITH US. 
WHAT EXACTLY IS DRIVING THIS 
SELL OFF. 
TO CHINA TARIFFS HAVE SOMETHING 
TO DO WITH IT? 
>> NO. 
I WOULD SAY THE INTEREST RATE 
WORRIES YOU MENTIONED ARE THE 
MAIN CULPRIT. 
YOU KNOW, INTEREST RATES HAVE 
BEEN A FEAR FOR MOST OF THE 
YEAR, AND, INVESTORS HAVE BEEN 
EXPECTING YIELDS IN THE 10-YEAR 
TREASURY TO RISE, JUST AS THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE HIKES INTEREST 
RATES. 
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE HIKED RATES 
THREE TIMES THIS YEAR AND ARE 
GEARING UP FOR A FOURTH ONE IN 
DECEMBER. 
ALTHOUGH, WITH THE MARKET 
VOLATILITY THAT WE ARE SEEING 
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE GOING TO 
HAVE INVESTORS START TO WONDER 
IF FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL 
WILL GO AHEAD WITH THAT 
DECEMBER HIKE. 
OBVIOUSLY, TIME WILL TELL. 
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
UNTIL THAT POINT. 
>> SCOTT, YOU FOLLOW THE 
MARKETS. 
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. 
HOW MUCH DID THIS SELLOFF 
SURPRISE YOU? 
IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. 
USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE A SELLOFF 
LIKE THIS THERE TENDS TO BE A 
LITTLE BIT OF ABOUNDS AT THE 
END OF THE DAY. 
BUYERS COMING IN FOR THE DEALS. 
WE DID NOT SEE THAT TODAY. 
>> HERE AT YAHOO FINANCE, WE'VE 
BEEN COVERING THE MARKET 
SELLOFF ALL DAY. 
AND, THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT 
POINT. 
WE DID NOT SEE ANY BUYERS COME 
IN AT THE END OF THE DAY, WAS 
SORT OF THIS PANIC SELLING, SO 
TO SPEAK. 
THE DOW WAS DOWN 500 POINTS. 
IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON. 
AND, AS THAT, YOU KNOW, 3:30 
LEVEL APPROACHED, 3:30 P.M., 
INTO THE 4 P.M. 
CLOSE, THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW SOME 
OF THE BIGGEST DECLINES IN THE 
DOW TODAY. 
LEADING 831 POINTS DECLINE. 
WHAT IS INTERESTING, THOUGH, 
IS, YIELDS ON THE 10 YEAR 
TREASURY YIELDS WE MENTIONED 
EARLIER, HOW THEY HAVE BEEN 
RISING, THE ACTUALLY FELL AT 
THE VERY END OF THE SESSION, 
MEANING THAT INVESTORS TOOK 
MONEY OUT OF STOCKS, AS YOU 
KNOW. 
BUT, ACTUALLY PUT THEM INTO 
BONDS AS A SAFE HAVEN PLACE. 
ANYTIME WE SEE TREASURY YIELDS 
FALL, IT MEANS INVESTORS HAVE 
BEEN BUYING BONDS, PRICES, AND 
YIELDS MOVE IN OPPOSITE 
DIRECTIONS. 
>> SO NOBODY IS SITTING ON 
THEIR CASH OR PUTTING IT INTO 
GOLD JUST YET? 
>> YEAH. 
I THINK THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF 
INVESTORS KIND OF SITTING ON 
THEIR HANDS, GOING INTO CASH. 
BUT YOU KNOW, LOOK. 
IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT THE S&P 500 IS STILL UP 4% 
FOR THE YEAR. 
YOU KNOW, AND WE COULD VERY 
WELL END UP WELL BEYOND THAT 
LEVEL TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
YEAR. 
A LOT OF STRATEGISTS STILL HAVE 
A 3000 TARGET ON THE S&P 500. 
WE ARE NOW AT 27,085. 
THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER IS 
THAT, OCTOBER IS TYPICALLY A 
VOLATILE MONTH FOR THE MARKET. 
AS YOU GO BACK HISTORICALLY. 
WE'VE HAD MANY CORRECTIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, DURING 
THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. 
>> SO, SCOTT, HOW CONCERNED DO 
YOU THINK INVESTORS SHOULD BE? 
OR SHOULD THEY WAKE UP TOMORROW 
MORNING AND START BUYING UP THE 
DEALS? 
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 
TO LOOK AT HOW SOME OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS PERFORM 
OVERNIGHT. 
AND, WE WILL KIND OF REASSESS 
IN THE MORNING, SEE WHERE 
FUTURES ARE, SEE WHERE EUROPE 
IS, SEE WHERE ASIA IS. 
BUT, I WOULD EXPECT SOME 
ADDITIONAL VOLATILITY, INTO 
TOMORROW, JUST GIVEN HOW WE 
DIDN'T SEE ANY BUYERS COME IN 
AT THE END OF THE TRADING 
SESSION TODAY. 
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER THING TO 
POINT OUT, IS THAT, INVESTORS 
ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO REMAIN 
DIVERSIFIED. 
SO, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH INTEREST RATES. 
AND, YOU HAVE TO WONDER, WHAT 
DO INTEREST RATES HAVE TO DO 
WITH EARNINGS PRICE OF 
MULTIPLE, OF SAY, PFIZER, OR 
PROCTOR AND GAMBLE? 
OR, STOCKS THAT COMPANIES WILL 
DO WELL, REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS 
GOING ON IN THE MARKET ECONOMY? 
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE BUYING 
TOOTHPASTE, BUYING MEDICINE. 
I THINK WE WILL START TO SEE 
SOME OF THOSE DEFENSIVE PLAYS 
IN THE MARKETS CREEP UP. 
>> OKAY, SCOTT, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHT. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, TANYA. 
>> LET'S TURN BACK NOW TO 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
CBS NEWS CAN SHOOTING MARRIOTT 
-- METEOROLOGIST JEFF BARICELLI 
IS HERE. 
WE ARE TALKING EARLY. 
YOU HAVE FAMILY DOWN IN PANAMA 
CITY. 
YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH THEM. 
WHAT HAVE THEY TOLD YOU ABOUT 
CONDITIONS THERE? 
>> I WAS TALKING WITH MY 
COUSIN. 
HER IN-LAWS ARE IN PANAMA CITY, 
BUT ABOUT 20 MILES INLAND AT A 
SHELTER, A SCHOOL. 
THE ROOF HAS BLOWN OFF AND THE 
RAIN IS FLOODING AND TARGET 
GOES TO SHOW YOU EVEN SOME OF 
THE BETTER MADE STRUCTURES ARE 
FAILING AS THIS STORM MOVES 
OFFSHORE. 
>> SHOULDN'T WE ASSURE THAT A 
SCHOOL IS BUILT TO CATEGORY 
THREE STANDARDS? 
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR SCHOOL. 
WE TALKED ABOUT IT. 
AFTER 1992, FLORIDA STARTED TO 
MAKE THE BUILDING CODES MORE 
STRINGENT. 
IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER 2001 
WHERE THEY MADE IT MANDATORY 
FOR STRUCTURES TO BE ABLE TO 
WITHSTAND CATEGORY THREE. 
EVEN STRUCTURES THAT CAN 
WITHSTAND CATEGORY THREE MAY 
NOT BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND 
CATEGORY FOUR OR CATEGORY FIVE. 
>> HOW FAR INLAND WAS THIS 
SHELTER? 
>> ABOUT 25 MILES INLAND. 
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. 
IF PEOPLE WERE TAKING SHELTER 
THERE, IT DID NOT TURN OUT TO 
BE A GREAT SHELTER. 
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW DEVASTATING 
THE SITUATION IS. 
>> I HOPE THEY ARE OKAY. 
WHERE DID THEY GO? 
>> I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE FINE. 
MY FAMILY HAS TALKED TO THEM. 
THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO I'M SURE 
STAYED IN MOBILE HOMES, STAYED 
IN STRUCTURES THAT WERE BUILT 
BEFORE 19, YOU KNOW, 1992, OR 
2002, WHEN THE LAW WENT INTO 
EFFECT. 
AND, HOPEFULLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE 
SAFE. 
>> JEFF, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US 
ABOUT THE STORM? 
HAS IT REDUCED ITS INTENSITY AT 
ALL YET? 
>> WINDS ARE DOWN TO 140 MILES 
AN HOUR. 
IT'S CROSSING OVER I-10. 
NEXT STOP WILL BE THE FLORIDA-
GEORGIA LINE. 
BECAUSE IT WAS STRENGTHENING 
WHEN IT MADE LANDFALL, IT MEANS 
IT'S GOING TO WE CAN LESS 
RAPIDLY. 
THAT MEANS IT'S GOING TO CARRY 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS AND 
DAMAGING WINDS STRAIGHT THROUGH 
GEORGIA. 
THERE IS GOING TO BE A SWATH OF 
DAMAGE, CATEGORY TWO, MAYBE 
CATEGORY THREE TYPE DAMAGE AND 
PARTS OF SOUTHERN GEORGIA. 
>> THAT HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS 
BEFORE? 
>> IT'S RARE THAT A STORM WILL 
BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS 
ITENSITY. 
WE SAW IT WITH CHARLIE, WE SAW 
IT WITH THIS STORM, AND THE 
COMMON DENOMINATOR IS, THERE 
WERE STRENGTHE
FIT THEY HAVE TO PLATEAU, 
THEN THEY CAN BEGIN TO WEAKEN. 
THE STORM IS GOING FURTHER IN 
WITH STRONGER WINDS. 
>> WHAT ABOUT RAINFALL? 
DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATES ON THAT? 
>> WELL, THE RAINFALL AT MAX IS 
GOING TO BE ABOUT A FOOT, GIVE 
OR TAKE, MORE THAN THAT. 
THAT'S OKAY IN NORTH FLORIDA, 
BUT IT'S GOING TO CAUSE FLASH 
FLOODING IN GEORGIA. 
AND THEN, ONCE IT GETS INTO 
PLACES LIKE SOUTH AND NORTH 
CAROLINA, WHERE WE STILL HAVE 
SATURATED GROUND AND SWOLLEN 
RIVERS, WE ARE LIKELY TO SEE 
ANOTHER ROUND OF SUBSTANTIAL 
FLOODING THERE. 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN STARTING 
LATER TONIGHT. 
THE RAIN HAS STARTED AT TIMES, 
BUT THE HEAVIEST RAIN, 
ESPECIALLY TOMORROW, TOMORROW, 
AS THAT TROPICAL STORM MOVES 
ACROSS THE CAROLINAS. 
ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF 
ISOLATED TORNADOES AS WELL. 
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU ABOUT 
THAT. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN REGARDS 
TO THAT RIGHT NOW? 
ANY INDICATION? 
>> SURE. 
EVERY LANDFALLING TROPICAL 
SYSTEM PRODUCES ONE TORNADO. 
SOME PRODUCE A LOT, SOME 
PRODUCE LESS. 
NO TELLING IF THIS WILL BE A 
LOT OR A LITTLE BUT, EITHER WAY,
THERE WILL BE FAST-MOVING RAIN 
WRAPPED TORNADOES. 
YOU CAN SEE THEM AND IT'S HARD 
TO PREPARE FOR THEM. 
WHEN WE SEE THESE AS 
METEOROLOGIST, THEY'RE MOVING 
60, 70, 80 MILES AN HOUR. 
WE SEE THEM AND MIGHT BE ABLE 
TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
LEAD TIME. 
EITHER WAY, YOU MIGHT NOT BE 
ABLE TO SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY 
ARE WRAPPED IN RAIN. 
IT'S JUST A DIFFICULT SITUATION 
BUT AGAIN, THE SYSTEM IS GOING 
TO BE WEAKENING TONIGHT. 
I THINK BY TOMORROW MORNING, IT 
SHOULD BE AROUND TROPICAL STORM 
STATUS. 
>> WHAT'S THE BIGGEST DANGER 
FOR FOLKS THERE OVERNIGHT? 
>> IT'S GOING TO BE WIND 
DAMAGE. 
UNDOUBTABLY, IT'S GOING TO BE 
WIND DAMAGE AND THEN A CONCERN 
WILL TURN TO FRESHWATER 
FLOODING AND RAIN DAMAGE 
STARTING TOMORROW AND INTO 
FRIDAY MORNING. 
THE STORM WILL BE MOVING 
OFFSHORE. 
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 
NOT MOVING AT THE PACE THAT 
FLORENCE DID. 
MOVING MUCH, MUCH SLOWER. 
ONE OTHER THING TO MENTION IS 
THAT THIS IS NOT HAPPENING IN 
AUGUST. 
PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT POWER 
FOR THREE WEEKS OR SO IN 
CERTAIN AREAS. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS, MAYBE THEY 
WON'T NEED THEIR AIR 
CONDITIONING QUITE AS MUCH AS 
THEY WOULD IN AUGUST. 
THIS WOULD BE BETTER FOR THE 
PEOPLE WHO RELY ON AIR 
CONDITIONING AND ELECTRICITY 
BUT STILL, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 
EASY BY ANY MEANS. 
>> THAT'S HELPFUL FOR THE 
ELDERLY, CORRECT? 
SO MANY PARISH WHEN THEY HAVE 
NO AIR CONDITIONING IN MID-
AUGUST. 
>> WE SAW WITH HURRICANE MARIA, 
IT WASN'T SO MUCH THE DAY OF 
THE STORM THE PEOPLE DIED. 
IT WAS THE AFTERMATH AND PEOPLE 
NOT HAVING THE ELECTRICITY OR 
ESSENTIALS TO GET THEM THROUGH 
AND SO WE SAW A LOT OF DEATHS 
AFTER THE DAY THAT MARIA HIT. 
>> WE GOT AN UPDATE THAT MORE 
THAN 257,000 PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT 
POWER. 
CERTAINLY, THAT NUMBER IS 
EXPECTED TO GO UP. 
YOU MENTIONED THE FRESHWATER 
SURGE THAT WILL HAPPEN. 
IS THAT MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE 
OCEAN SURGE THAT WILL 
EVENTUALLY GO BACK OUT? 
>> WELL YOU KNOW, THEY ARE BOTH 
SOMEWHAT EQUALLY DANGEROUS. 
YES, THE SURGE WILL GO OUT. 
THERE IS STILL ONSHORE FLOW SO 
IT WILL TAKE A WILD FOR IT TO 
HAPPEN. 
IF YOU ARE AT THE BEACH, THAT 
WILL GO. 
AS WE SAW WITH FLORENCE, SOME 
OF THE FRESHWATER FLOODING CAN 
LINGER FOR DAYS AND DAYS. 
THAT'S THE LAST THING THEY 
NEEDED IN THE CAROLINAS. 
FRESHWATER RIVER FLOODING FROM 
HEAVY RAIN BUT THEY ARE GOING 
TO GET IT AGAIN. 
>> THEY ARE GOING TO GET IT 
AGAIN. 
JEFF BERARDELLI, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK  
RAKE AND WILL BE BACK WITH MUCH 
MORE CBSN. 
STAY WITH US. 
>>> NICOLE KILLIAM IN PANAMA 
CITY BEACH  JOINS US ON THE 
PHONE. 
YOUR CREW WAS WORKING HARD TO 
KEEP UP THE GEAR. 
WE SEE FROM YOUR LIVE SHOT, 
THOSE TREES BLOWING IN THE 
WIND. 
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 
EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. 
>> AT THIS POINT, WE'VE TAKEN 
SHELTER IN A HOTEL WHERE WE ARE 
STAYING, NOT TOO LONG AFTER WE 
DID THE LIVE SHOT, WE HAD TO 
COME IN BECAUSE AS THAT STORM 
WAS MAKING LANDFALL, THE WIND 
AND RAIN REALLY GOT REALLY 
INTENSE. 
IN FACT AT TIMES, YOU COULD 
JUST SEE LITERALLY A WALL OF 
WATER PASS THROUGH. 
AND OF COURSE, THAT 
TRADITIONAL, CLASSIC SOUND OF A 
TRAIN THAT YOU HERE WITH THE 
STRONG WINDS GUSTING THROUGH. 
SO, WE HAVE KIND OF BEEN 
HANGING OUT, IF YOU WILL. 
MAYBE THAT IS TOO CASUAL A TERM 
IN THE HOTEL. 
WE'VE LOST POWER, EVEN SOME 
PARTS OF THE HOTEL ARE STARTING 
TO COME APART AS WELL. 
SOME OF THE CEILING TILES HAVE 
COME DOWN. 
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME LEAKS 
COMING FROM THE CEILING. 
THERE ARE OTHER MEDIA HERE AS 
WELL. 
SO YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY IS 
TRYING TO NAVIGATE THE 
SITUATION AS BEST WE CAN. 
IT DOES APPEAR AT THIS POINT IN 
TIME THAT SOME OF THE WINDS 
HAVE STARTED TO DIE DOWN. 
BUT AGAIN, WE KNOW WE ARE NOT 
OUT OF THE WOODS JUST YET. 
>> HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU 
AND THE CREW WILL HAVE TO TAKE 
SHELTER AT THIS POINT? 
>> WELL, I ULD THINK FOR AT 
LEAST, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT HOUR 
OR TWO, UNTIL THESE CONDITIONS 
IMPROVE. 
BECAUSE THERE IS STILL DEBRIS 
BLOWING AROUND OUT THERE. 
IN FACT, THE POSITION WHERE WE 
WERE, WE JUST SAW AS I 
MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, A WALL OF 
WATER COMING THROUGH, AND KIND 
OF THE GRASSY SPACE BEHIND US 
FILLED WITH WATER. 
SOME OF THAT HAS RECEDED. 
BUT AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I'M 
LOOKING RIGHT NOW AT ALL TYPES 
OF DEBRIS, THAT IS ON THE 
GROUND. 
YOU KNOW, PIECES OF TREES, YOU 
KNOW, SMALL, LARGE, YOU KNOW, 
ALL SIZES. 
SO AGAIN, OBVIOUSLY WE WILL 
JUST HAVE TO KIND OF MAKE A 
DETERMINATION, AS THINGS 
PROGRESS. 
>> REMARKABLE TO SEE THAT YOU 
HAVE PIECES OF THE HOTEL COMING 
APART. 
WHAT HAS BEEN THE CONCERN WHEN 
YOU TALK TO OFFICIALS IN THAT 
AREA? 
WHAT'S THEIR BIG CONCERN AT 
THIS MOMENT? 
>> WELL, A COUPLE OF THINGS. 
THE MAIN CONCERN IS THAT THE 
LOCAL AUTHORITY HAD PEOPLE WHO 
CHOSE TO RIDE OUT THE STORM AND 
DID NOT EVACUATE, AND, THERE 
HAVE BEEN SHELTERS THAT HAS 
BEEN SET UP FOR THOSE FOLKS. 
BUT, THERE ARE CLEARLY FOLKS 
WHO DID NOT HEED THE WARNINGS. 
IN FACT, RIGHT BEFORE THINGS 
REALLY PICKED UP,  WE HAD AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH THE 
POLICE CHIEF OF PANAMA CITY 
BEACH. 
AND HE SAID, LOOK. 
I CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO LEAVE 
THEIR HOMES. 
AND YOU KNOW, AT A CERTAIN 
POINT IN TIME, YOU KNOW, HE HAS 
TO PROTECT HIS OWN FORCE. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> YOU KNOW, WE DID SEE LOCAL 
AUTHORITIES STAY AT A CERTAIN 
POINT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO 
COME OUT AND SAVE YOU. 
THAT'S THE MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR 
CONVEYED AS WELL. 
YOU KNOW, UNTIL THE CONDITIONS 
IMPROVE. 
>> FORTUNATELY, GOVERNOR RICK 
SCOTT HAS A GREAT DEAL OF 
EXPERIENCE, IN DEALING WITH 
HURRICANES AND GETTING THE WORD 
OUT. 
WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING THE 
PAST FEW HOURS? 
>> HE HAS BEEN TRYING TO 
EMPHASIZE HOW SERIOUS THIS IS, 
AND HOW SERIOUS PEOPLE SHOULD 
TAKE THIS. 
YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A 
STORM, THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS 
STORM IS ONE THAT THIS PART OF 
FLORIDA HASN'T SEEN, OR 
EXPERIENCED IN AT LEAST A 
CENTURY. 
HE MADE THAT CLEAR. 
AND, I THINK WHAT SURPRISED US 
ALL IS THE INTENSITY OF THIS 
STORM. 
THIS CAME ASHORE AT 155 MILES 
PER HOUR. 
JUST SHY OF A CATEGORY FIVE. 
AND YOU KNOW, TO WATCH HOW 
RAPIDLY IT PICKED UP IN 
STRENGTH, I PERSONALLY THINK IS 
JUST REMARKABLE. 
>> WHAT DID YOU EXPERIENCE, 
NICOLE? 
AS WE WERE WATCHING YOU, WE SAW 
WHAT APPEARED TO BE YOUR CAMERA 
GEAR MOVING AROUND. 
YOUR PRODUCER THERE STEPPING IN 
TO MAKE SURE IT LOOKED LIKE IT 
WASN'T HITTING YOU. 
HOW DID IT JUST DETERIORATE, TO 
FORCE YOU TO STAY, TO SEEK 
SHELTER INSIDE OF A HOTEL? 
>> WELL AGAIN, THIS WAS AT THE 
CLIMAX OF THE STORM, RIGHT AS 
IT WAS COMING THROUGH, MAKING 
LANDFALL. 
THAT'S WHERE THE STRONGEST 
WINDS ARE. 
SO IT JUST GOT TO A POINT WHERE 
YES, IT WAS QUITE DIFFICULT TO 
STAND, AND WE CONTINUED TO SEE. 
I THINK DURING THE SHOT, WE 
POINTED OUT A ROOF THAT WAS 
COMING APART, AND AN AUTO BODY 
SHOP. 
AND, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY BEING 
OUT IN THOSE CONDITIONS, YOU 
DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE FLYING 
THROUGH THE AIR. 
SO, THAT'S WHY WE MADE THE CALL 
THAT EVEN AS SOON AS WE CAME IN 
AND BROUGHT ALL OF OUR GEAR IN, 
THE DOOR LEADING OUTSIDE, KEPT 
BLOWING OPEN. 
SO, LITERALLY, OUR CREW, AND, 
YOU KNOW, THE TWO PEOPLE WHO 
ARE MANNING THIS HOTEL FOR US, 
TO TRY TO TIE THE DOOR DOWN AND 
KEEP IT SHUT SO THAT WE DID NOT 
GET THOSE GUSTS COMING INTO THE 
HALLWAY, THINKING THAT WE WERE 
SEEKING SHELTER, WHEN REALLY, 
WE WERE ONCE AGAIN EXPOSED TO 
MORE RISK. 
>> INCREDIBLE. 
NICOLE, GLAD YOU AND THE CREW 
ARE SAFE AND SEEKING SHELTER. 
WE WILL CHECK CHECK IN WITH YOU 
THROUGHOUT THIS AFTERNOON. 
THANK YOU, NICOLE. 
I WANT TO BRING IN CBS NEWS 
CORRESPONDENT OMAR VILLAFRANCA. 
HE JOINS US FROM PORT SAINT JOE 
IN FLORIDA. 
HE IS ON THE PHONE. 
TELL US WHAT YOU ARE 
EXPERIENCING. 
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW, WE ARE 
STARTING TO GET SOME OF THE 
BACKSIDE OF THE BANDS OF 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
WE SAW PLENTY OF WIND, AS THE 
STORM SYSTEM IS MOVING ONSHORE. 
SO, THE TREES THAT ARE DOTTING 
ALL OF THE LANDSCAPE HERE WERE 
JUST BENDING OVER SIDEWAYS. 
AND, WE SAW TREES SNAP. 
WE SAW PIECES OF BUILDING THAT 
WERE COMING OFF. 
POWER IS OUT IN THIS AREA OF 
GULF COUNTY. 
AND, THAT'S GOING TO BE 
SOMETHING THAT FOLKS WILL HAVE 
TO DEAL WITH FOR SEVERAL DAYS, 
AND MAYBE EVEN LONGER. 
STORM SURGE OF COURSE, ALWAYS A 
BIG CONCERN. 
PEOPLE ARE STAYING OFF THE 
ROADS. 
THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. 
THE BAD NEWS IS, THAT STORM 
SURGE CAME WITH FURY. 
IN THE MATTER OF MINUTES, WE 
SAW WATER ON THE ROAD THAT WAS 
JUST A FEW INCHES. 
WENT UP TO ALMOST 2 FEET. 
IT WAS MOVING VERY, VERY 
QUICKLY. 
THIS ONE, LITERALLY PARKED TO 
GET SOME SHOTS OF VIDEO AND IT 
WAS RISING UP VERY FAST. 
BUT, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE 
HUNKERED DOWN. 
THERE WAS AN EVACUATION ORDER 
IN THE AREA, ROUGHLY 3500 
PEOPLE LIVE IN PORT SAINT JOE. 
BUT, THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT WAS 
TELLING US THAT THEY BELIEVE 
60%, MORE THAN HALF OF THE 
PEOPLE, BASICALLY WERE 
GATHERING SUPPLIES AND WERE 
HUNKERING DOWN. 
THERE IS A SMALL LITTLE MOTEL 
AROUND HERE AND THE PARKING LOT 
IS PACKED AND FULL OF LOCALS 
WHO MAY BE AT VACATION HOMES OR 
HOMES NEAR THE WATER AND THEY 
DECIDED TO COME A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER INLAND, JUST IN CASE. 
THEY ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH 
STORM SURGE. 
>> REALLY QUICKLY, YOU SAID 60% 
OF PEOPLE CHOSE TO STAY AND 
HUNKER DOWN. 
>> YEAH. 
AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE 
SHERIFF DEPARTMENT WAS NOT 
GOING TO GO DOOR TO DOOR AND 
PULL PEOPLE OUT, EVEN THOUGH IT 
WAS A MANDATORY EVACUATION. 
THEY STILL HAD THAT KIND OF 
MANPOWER. 
BUT, PEOPLE ARE AT THEIR OWN 
RISK. 
OVER HERE, IT'S CLOSED. 
THE AMBULANCES ARE INLAND. 
ONE OF THE COUNTY 
COMMISSIONERS, WE SAW THEM 
SURVEYING SOME OF THE DAMAGE, 
BEFORE THE EYE HIT. 
HE BASICALLY SAID, IF ANYBODY 
HAS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AT THIS 
POINT, THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE 
TO WAIT UNTIL THE HURRICANE 
PATH  IS IN THE FACE OF CERTAIN 
RESPONDERS TO GET OUT. 
THAT'S WHY THEY PUT OTHER 
PEOPLE ON LEAVE. 
IF YOU NEED HELP, IT'S NOT 
GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. 
>> INCREDIBLE TO HEAR YOU SAY 
THAT. 
OMAR VILLAFRANCA, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 
>>> JOINING ME ON THE PHONE, WE 
HAVE JONATHAN McNAMARA, A 
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE 
RED CROSS IN TALLAHASSEE. 
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CONCERN 
RIGHT NOW? 
>> RIGHT NOW, WE ARE CONCERNED 
WITH PEOPLE NOT LISTENING TO 
THE WARNINGS FROM LOCAL 
OFFICIALS. 
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE WINDOW 
FROM OUR HEADQUARTERS, AND 
CONDITIONS HAVE DETERIORATED 
RAPIDLY. 
AND, IT REALLY IS IMPORTANT 
THAT YOU LISTEN TO LOCAL 
OFFICIALS. 
STAY IN YOUR HOMES. 
PUT AS MUCH DISTANCE BETWEEN 
YOU AND THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR 
HOME AS POSSIBLE. 
SO, THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE 
INTERIOR CLOSET AND INTERIOR 
BATHROOM, JUST SO THAT YOU ARE 
NOT BY WINDOWS, SO THAT ANY 
DEBRIS OR OTHER THINGS CAN COME 
IN, TO DAMAGE OR INJURY YOU AND 
YOUR FAMILY. 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU DO HEED 
THE WARNINGS. 
>> JONATHAN AT THIS POINT, FOR 
FOLKS HUNKERING DOWN, WE ARE 
SEEING THE IMAGES FROM PANAMA 
CITY BEACH. 
JUST INCREDIBLE THE WAY THAT 
TREES ARE  SWAYING IN THE WIND. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU, ONCE THIS 
MAKES LANDFALL AND YOU DEAL 
WITH A SITUATION DAYS LATER, 
HOW DOES THE RED CROSS RESPOND? 
WHAT DO YOU NEED AND HOW CAN 
PEOPLE HELP? 
>> WE HAVE 500 DISASTER WORKERS 
ENGAGED IN THE RESPONSE 
CURRENTLY, FOCUSED ON PROVIDING 
SHELTER. 
BUT OVER THE DAYS TO COME, ONCE 
CONDITIONS ARE SAFE, WE WILL 
MOVE INTO THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS 
PERIOD NEIGHBORHOOD BY 
NEIGHBORHOOD, ASSESSING DAMAGE, 
AND ALSO PROVIDING FOODS. 
THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT YOU 
WOULD EXPECT FROM THE AMERICAN 
RED CROSS, BUT ALSO PROVIDING 
SHELTERS TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE 
HOMES MAY BE DAMAGED DURING THE 
STORM. 
WE ENCOURAGE VIEWERS, DOWNLOAD 
THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE APP THAT 
WILL HAVE THE FULL AMOUNT OF 
SHELTERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE 
AFTER THE STORM. 
AS WELL AS CHECKING YOUR 
SPECIFIC LOCALITY, SPECIFIC 
INFORMATION ABOUT SHELTERS, PET 
SHELTERS, AND OTHER LOCATIONS 
THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO HELP 
YOU STAY SAFE. 
AS ALWAYS, IT IS THE GENEROSITY 
OF THE VIEWERS THAT ALLOW US TO 
RESPOND TO THE STORMS BEFORE 
THEY HIT. 
SO, IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE 
INFORMATION, VISIT 
REDCROISSANTOR GORE-TEX 
"MICHAEL" TO 90999. 
BUT, ONE LAST THING. 
AMPLIFY THE MESSAGES ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA NOT JUST FROM THE RED 
CROSS BUT FROM OTHER LOCAL 
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, PUTTING 
OUT CRITICAL SOCIAL MEDIA KITS, 
SO, IF YOU SEE THAT, RETWEET 
IT, REPOST IT. 
THE MORE PEOPLE THAT GET ACCESS 
TO THIS INFORMATION, THE MORE 
PEOPLE WILL BE SAFE. 
>> JONATHAN McNAMARA WITH THE 
AMERICAN RED CROSS IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
HOPE YOU AND THE CREW STAY SAFE.
TAKE CARE. 
GRATEFUL YOU COULD JOIN US. 
WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER NEWS TO 
GET TO AS WELL BUT ARE 
MONITORING THE BIG STORY TODAY. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL, STICK WITH 
US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> JOINING US NOW FROM 
FLORIDA'S CAPITAL, TALLAHASSEE, 
CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT MANUEL 
BOJORQUEZ. 
CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT 
YOU ARE SEEING AT THIS POINT? 
>> Reporter: WE ARE IN DOWNTOWN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
THE TREES THAT THE CITY IS 
FAMOUS FOR AND SPANISH MOSS 
BEHIND ME ARE STARTING TO TELL 
THE STORY. 
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, YOU GET 
A PRETTY GOOD GUST COMING 
THROUGH HERE, AND IT ALL GET 
GOING. 
WE ARE ALREADY GETTING REPORTS 
OF POWER OUTAGES IN THE 
TALLAHASSEE AREA. 
WE SPOKE WITH THE MUNICIPAL 
POWER COMPANY EARLIER TODAY. 
THEY TOLD US USUALLY THEY HAD 
ABOUT 120 PEOPLE WORKING. 
TODAY, THEY HAVE 600 PEOPLE 
STANDING BY. 
THAT'S JUST THE MUNICIPAL 
COMPANY, TRYING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THEY CAN KEEP THE LIGHTS 
ON. 
THERE ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
MASSIVE POWER OUTAGES HERE, AS 
HURRICANE MICHAEL MAKES ITS WAY 
ASHORE. 
AND THEN FURTHER INLAND, YOU 
HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ALTHOUGH 
THE MAJOR IMPACTS OF THE STORM 
RIGHT NOW ARE HAPPENING, ALONG 
THE COAST, THAT THE INLAND 
AREAS ARE GOING TO ALSO GET 
THOSE HURRICANE FORCE WINDS, 
INCLUDING RIGHT HERE IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
SO, WE WON'T BE STANDING BY 
THOSE TREES IN A FEW HOURS, 
WHEN THAT HURRICANE COMES 
THROUGH HERE. 
EXPECT IT TO BE IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON OR EVENING HOURS. 
SHELTERS ARE OPEN. 
WE ARE SEEING NOT MANY PEOPLE 
OUT AND ABOUT, WHICH IS A VERY 
GOOD THING. 
AGAIN, THAT WIND, STARTING TO 
PICK UP. 
IT REALLY EBBS AND FLOWS BUT 
PRETTY SOON, IT WILL START TO 
BE CONSISTENT LIKE WE ARE 
SEEING FROM OUR COLLEAGUES' 
REPORTS OUT ALONG THE COAST.  
>> YEAH, THE REPORTS WE ARE 
SEEING, THE IMAGES FROM OUR 
COLLEAGUES, NICOLE KILLIAN IN 
THAT AREA, PRETTY TREMENDOUS. 
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING, POINT OF 
IMPACT? 
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING, WHEN IT 
WILL REALLY TOUCHDOWN AND 
AFFECT YOU IN TALLAHASSEE? 
>> Reporter: WHAT WE ARE 
HEARING SO FAR IS THAT BY LATE 
AFTERNOON, LATE AFTERNOON INTO 
THE EVENING, THAT'S WHEN 
CONDITIONS ARE GOING TO REALLY 
START TO DETERIORATE. 
THE BIG CONCERN HERE IS CLEARLY 
NOT GOING TO BE COASTAL 
FLOODING, OR STORM SURGE. 
IT'S GOING TO BE THIS. 
SO MANY TREES HERE. 
AND, ANY OF THEM THAT ARE OLD 
OR DYING, OR SIMPLY CANNOT 
HANDLE THE HURRICANE FORCE 
WINDS, WELL, THOSE BRANCHES AND 
TREES ARE EXPECTED TO COME DOWN 
ONTO HOMES, ONTO BUILDINGS, 
WHICH OF COURSE COULD CAUSE 
INJURY OR DEATH. 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE WANTING TO 
GET PEOPLE INTO SHELTERS, AWAY 
FROM TREES. 
BUT ALSO, THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE 
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE POWER 
OUTAGES EXPECTED THROUGHOUT 
THIS AREA. 
SO, IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH, 
LATE AFTERNOON TO EVENING FOR 
THE TALLAHASSEE AREA. 
THEN, IT MOVES ON OUT OF HERE. 
AND THEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE 
DAMAGE EFT BEHIND. 
WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT AS FAR 
AS POWER OUTAGES, ONCE THE 
WINDS START TO REALLY GET 
CONSISTENT, AT ABOUT 35 MILES 
PER HOUR, AND WE MAY BE THERE 
VERY SOON, THAT IS WHEN THE 
POWER COMPANY SAYS IT'S NO 
LONGER SAFE FOR THEIR CRUISE TO 
BE OUT AND ABOUT, TRYING TO 
RESTORE WHATEVER POWERLINES MAY 
HAVE BEEN KNOCKED DOWN VERY 
EARLY ON IN THE STORM. 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE DOING 
THAT ANYMORE SO IT MAY NOT BE 
UNTIL TOMORROW WHEN THEY GET 
SOME DAYLIGHT AND THE WINDS 
HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS AREA, 
THAT THEY ARE FINALLY ABLE TO 
START ONE, CLEARING TREES, AND 
TWO, RESTORE POWER. 
THEY DO HAVE PRIORITIES WHEN IT 
COMES TO RESTORING POWER. 
THE HOSPITALS, NURSING HOMES, 
THE ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES, 
THOSE ARE THE ONES THEY WILL 
TRY TO GET BACK ONLINE FIRST, 
CLEARLY, FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. 
THOSE OF PEOPLE WHO NEED THE 
POWER THE MOST, AND THE MOST 
QUICKLY. 
BUT, IT'S GOING TO BE A ROUGH 
GOING HERE IN TALLAHASSEE AS WE 
ARE STARTING TO SEE THOSE 
REPORTS FROM THE COAST. 
AND, A SLIGHTLY WEAKER VERSION 
OF MICHAEL BEGINS TO MAKE ITS 
WAY HERE INTO THE STATE'S 
CAPITAL. 
>> MANNY, YOU LIVE IN MIAMI. 
YOU KNOW ABOUT HURRICANE 
COVERAGE AND PREPARATION. 
I'M JUST CURIOUS, OF THE FOLKS 
THAT YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO, WHAT 
ARE THE STORES LIKE THERE? 
THE GAS LINES. 
AND, WHAT DO PEOPLE ADVISE YOU, 
WHEN YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN 
COMING? 
>> Reporter: WELL, WE GOT HERE, 
AND AS YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LAND 
IN ONE OF THESE AREAS RIGHT 
BEFORE DISASTER, YOU GO AND 
LOOK FOR WATER FOR YOUR CREWS 
AND FOR YOURSELF. 
IMMEDIATELY, THE FIRST WALMART 
I WENT TO WAS OUT OF BREAD COME 
OUT OF WATER. 
PEOPLE DID PREPARE. 
THERE WERE GAS LINES. 
WE AREN'T SEEING AS MANY OF 
THOSE. 
THAT'S BECAUSE GAS STATIONS 
HAVE DECIDED TO WRAP UP THEIR 
PUMPS, HOPING TO SAVE THEM FROM 
ANY WATER DAMAGE. 
SO AT THIS POINT, AND WE FOR 
THE OFFICIALS SAY IT OVER AND 
OVER, IF YOU ARE NO LONGER 
PREPARED, OR IF YOU ARE STILL 
TRYING TO PREPARE, I SHOULD 
SAY, THE TIME IS REALLY UP. 
RIGHT NOW, IT'S JUST BRACE FOR 
IT. 
HUNKER DOWN, GET INDOORS, SOWS, 
TO THE INNERMOST PART OF ANY 
BUILDING. 
YOU MENTIONED  THE LESSONS 
LEARNED, FROM LIVING IN SOUTH 
FLORIDA, ESPECIALLY AFTER IRMA 
LAST YEAR. 
YOU WILL RECALL THERE WAS THAT 
HORRIBLE INCIDENT AT A NURSING 
HOME WHERE 14 PEOPLE DIED AFTER 
THE POWER WAS KNOCKED OUT FOR 
DAYS. 
AND, THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO GET 
THE POWER BACK INTO THE 
BUILDING.  
THEY HAD A MALFUNCTIONING 
GENERATOR. 
THERE IS A NEW LAW HERE IN 
FLORIDA THAT IS AIMING TO 
PREVENT THAT KIND OF A TRAGEDY 
FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. 
AND, REQUIRING ALL NURSING 
HOMES AND ASSISTED LIVING 
FACILITIES TO HAVE GENERATORS. 
BUT, AFTER THE DEADLINE OF JUNE 
1st PAST, NUMBERS SHOWED THAT A 
LOT OF THOSE FACILITIES, 
ESPECIALLY IN THIS AREA, DO NOT 
HAVE THOSE INSTALLED JUST YET 
FOR MANY REASONS. 
ZONING REGULATIONS. 
WE ARE TOLD THERE IS A LABOR 
SHORTAGE AND ALSO A SHORTAGE OF 
THOSE SUPPLIES. 
BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO PROVE 
THEY CAN KEEP RESIDENTS SAFE. 
AND, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE 
STATE IS LOOKING VERY CLOSELY 
INTO, AND THAT'S WHY THE POWER 
COMPANIES ARE LOOKING TO 
PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS, TO 
PREVENT ANYTHING LIKE THAT FROM 
HAPPENING AGAIN. 
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE 
TREES, THEY REALLY GET GOING. 
AND, THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW THAT, 
IT'S STARTING TO BECOME A 
LITTLE MORE CONSISTENT. 
IT IS NO LONGER ONCE EVERY 10 
MINUTES. 
IT'S STARTING TO BECOME A 
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A REGULAR 
FLW THROUGH HERE. 
SO CURRENTLY, MICHAEL IS 
GETTING CLOSER. 
>> INTERESTING, YOU POINT OUT 
THAT. 
PLEASE STAY SAFE, WE WILL CHECK 
BACK IN WITH YOU AND THE CREW 
THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON. 
THANKS SO MUCH, MANNY. 
>>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 
MONITORING HURRICANE MICHAEL AS 
IT MAKES LANDFALL.  
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE, DAMAGING 
WINDS, 150 MILES AN HOUR. 
WE'LL HAVE SO MUCH MORE. 
STAY WITH US. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN.  
ALWAYS ON. 
>>> ON THE "CBS EVENING NEWS," 
FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE, 
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY. 
>> AT 12 NOON, HIGH TIDE ROLLED 
IN. 
>> RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN'T TELL 
THE RIVERS FROM THE ROADS. 
>> IT'S BAD. 
A LOT OF RIVERS. 
A LOT OF TREES. 
>> THIS WAS A MASSIVE OAK TREE 
THAT WAS TOPPLED. 
>> FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES, 
THEY ARE HOPING THAT THEY WILL 
STILL HAVE HOMES TO RETURN TO. 
>> THIS IS THE WORST IT HAS 
EVER BEEN. 
>> THIS IS SCARY. 
>> 
THIS IS SOME OF THE WORST OF 
FLORENCE. 
>> THE WINDS ARE FEROCIOUS, 
GUSTING ABOVE 120 MILES AN 
HOUR. 
>> THE ISLAND IS STILL 
STRUGGLING TO RECOVER. 
AND MANY ARE WONDERING IF IT 
EVER WILL. 
PUERTO RICO IS SUFFERING AN 
EXODUS DRAINING ITS MOST 
VALUABLE RESOURCE. 
IT'S PEOPLE. 
>> A NUMBER OF SCHOOLS HAVE 
BEEN SHUT DOWN ACROSS THE 
ISLAND. 
 
>> THE MAGNITUDE OF MARIA WAS 
SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY HARD 
TO PLAN FOR. 
I WILL DIE TRYING TO MAKE SURE 
PUERTO RICO BECOMES A PLACE 
WHERE WE CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITY. 
 
>>> HELLO, I'M BILL WHITTAKER 
WITH 60 MINUTES. 
WE'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH 
CONGRESSMAN MORENO. 
>> THIS INDUSTRY IS SOUTH OF 
CONTROL. 
>> IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE 
LAW, PEOPLE DIE. 
>> WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN 
ABOUT THIS WITHOUT 60 MINUTES. 
>> I DID SEE THE REPORT. 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE 
REPORT AND TAKE IT VERY 
SERIOUSLY. 
>> JUST DRUG DEALERS IN LAB 
COATS. 
>> WE KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 
PICTURE THAT PAINTS. 
>>> HELLO EVERYONE, I'M TANYA 
RIVERO. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL IS NOW ONE OF 
THE MOST POWERFUL STORMS TO HIT 
THE U.S. MAINLAND. 
THE STORM MADE LANDFALL AS A 
CATEGORY 4 HITTING THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE NEAR MEXICO BEACH, 
THE HURRICANE IS NOW A CATEGORY 
3 BUT IS STILL PACKING QUITE A 
PUNCH. 
MORE THAN 257,000 PEOPLE ARE 
WITHOUT POWER. 
CBS NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER DAVID 
PARKINSON JOINS US NOW. 
SO DOWN TO A CATEGORY 3, BUT 
STILL A VERY, VERY POWERFUL 
STORM. 
IS THE WORST OF IT OVER? 
>> TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. 
I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE IN ANY 
OF THE PLACES WHERE THE STORM 
MADE LANDFALL, THE CONDITIONS 
WILL BE GETTING GRADUALLY 
BETTER. 
THE RAIN WILL STOP IN PANAMA 
CITY THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 
THE WIND IS IN THE 30s . I WANT 
TO CAUTION PEOPLE DON'T THINK 
JUST BECAUSE THE WORST OF THE 
STORM IS PASSED THAT YOU SHOULD 
GO OUTSIDE, THERE WILL BE A LOT 
OF DOWNED POWER LINES, LOTS OF 
DEBRIS. 
IT WILL BE QUITE DANGEROUS. 
THAT'S ASSUMING YOU DIDN'T 
EVACUATE WHICH AGAIN, YOU 
SHOULD HAVE EVACUATED. 
>> IS A CATEGORY 3 STILL STRONG 
ENOUGH TO LAUNCH TREES AND 
OTHER ITEMS INTO THE AIR AND 
MAKE THEM DEADLY PROJECTILES? 
>> OH IT IS. 
TREES COME DOWN IN 50, 60 MILES 
AN HOUR WINDS. 
IN TALLAHASSEE, WE THOUGHT THEY 
MIGHT GET HIT BY THE EYE WALL. 
THEY WILL DODGE THAT BULLET BY 
ABOUT 20 MILES SO IT'S A VERY 
CONFINED AREA. 
IF YOU ARE IN THE AREA OF THE 
CENTER OF THAT STORM, THAT'S 
WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE MOST WIND. 
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS 
THOUGH THE STORM SURGES ARE 
GOING DOWN, WE'RE APPROACHING A 
HIGH TIDE CYCLE. 
YOU HAVE TO CONTEND WITH STORM 
SURGE AND THINGS REALLY DO 
START IMPROVING. 
YOU'LL SEE BLUE SKY TOMORROW 
FOR SURE. 
>> HAVE YOU SEEN THE LATEST 
RADAR IMAGES? 
IS THE EYE PRETTY INTACT? 
>> IT'S DEFINITELY GETTING LESS 
INTACT. 
BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE THAT 
THE STORM IS HOLDING TOGETHER 
ITS FIGURE. 
YOU CAN  SEE. 
>> THAT'S A PRETTY CLEAR EYE. 
>> AND ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF 
THE STORM, THE STORM LOOKS TO 
BE A LITTLE BIT STRONGER IN 
TERMS OF ITS RAIN BANDS. 
WHEN YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT THE 
STRONGEST WINDS USUALLY ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE STORM BECAUSE 
YOU GET TO ADD THE FORWARD 
PROGRESS OF THE STORM WHICH IS 
MOVING AT 15 MILES AN HOUR PLUS 
THE WIND. 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS A CLOSE 
ZOOMED IN RADAR. 
AND RIGHT ON THE LINE OF 
GEORGIA AND ALABAMA IS WHERE 
THE HEAVIEST BANDS ARE NOW. 
ANOTHER THING TO NOTE, THERE 
WILL BE PLENTY OF TORNADO 
WARNINGS. 
WE HAVE SEEN THEM NEAR 
JACKSONVILLE, NEAR MACON 
GEORGIA. 
THERE'S A TAIL ON THE STORM. 
THE CHANCE FOR POWER OUTAGES 
ALL THE WAY UP TOWARD ATLANTA. 
>> DOES THE TAIL BRING WIND? 
>> SO, THAT LITTLE TAIL OF 
SEVERE STORMS ESSENTIALLY WHAT 
HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE WIND MOVING 
AT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. 
YOU HAVE ROTATION IN THE 
ATMOSPHERE BRINGING ABOUT 
TORNADOES. 
ON TOP OF THAT, YOU HAVE STRONG 
STRAIGHT LINE WINDS SO IT'S A 
BAD COMBINATION OF THE TWO. 
THEY DON'T LAST VERY LONG 
NECESSARILY. 
BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY CAUSE 
PLENTY OF DAMAGE OR BE DEADLY. 
SO WHEN EVER YOU'RE UNDER A 
TORNADO WATCH WHICH THEY ARE 
UNTIL 2:00 A.M., YOU NEED TO 
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. 
THE RAIN, WE'VE SEEN HALF A 
FOOT OF RAIN WHERE THE STORM 
MADE LANDFALL. 
WE WILL SEE LESS RAIN BUT IT IS 
HAPPENING SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S 
A FLASH FLOOD CONCERN. 
>> FLORENCE MOVED SO SLOWLY. 
MICHAEL SEEMS TO BE SPEEDING 
ALONG COMPARED TO FLORENCE. 
>> MICHAEL FEELS LIKE A NORMAL 
HURRICANE SHOULD. 
RIGHT? 
WHICH IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE 
ANY SORT OF ATMOSPHERIC 
BLOCKING OR SOMETHING GUMMING 
UP THE WORKS OF FORWARD 
PROGRESS, THIS IS AROUND THE 
SPEED THAT YOU WOULD GET. 
10 TO 20 MILES AN HOUR RANGE. 
>> SO IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FAST? 
>> NO, BUT WHEN YOU COMPARE IT 
TO HARVEY OR FLORENCE OR IRMA, 
THIS IS MUCH FASTER THAN ANY OF 
THOSE STORMS. 
>> AND WHERE IS IT EVENTUALLY 
HEADED? 
WILL IT REACH US ON THE EAST 
COAST? 
>> IT WILL GET UP TO THE 
CHESAPEAKE AND MAKE ITS WAY OFF 
THE COAST. 
WE'LL SEE BREEZY WINDY 
CONDITIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. 
30 MILES AN HOUR WIND GUSTS. 
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE TAKE IN THE 
PATIO FURNITURE FROM BALCONIES. 
ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. 
BUT THE PLACES I'M MOST 
CONCERNED ABOUT TOMORROW, 
CENTRAL NORTH CAROLINA, CENTRAL 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
THEN, A STORM CONCERN IN 
SAVANNAH. 
WE'RE LOOKING AT THE RIVER IN 
SOUTH CAROLINA THAT FLOODED 
FROM HURRICANE FLORENCE. 
THE WAKAUMA RIVER NEVER GOT 
DOWN FROM FLOOD STAGE. 
PLENTY OF RIVERS IN THE 
COLUMBIA AREA AND FATEVILLE AND 
LUMBERTON. 
>> HOW MANY FOLKS ARE GETTING 
THIS KIND OF DOUBLE WHAMMY? 
>> IT'S PRETTY MUCH ANYONE IN 
CENTRAL, NORTHERN, AND NORTH 
AND SOUTH CAROLINA I SHOULD 
SAY. 
CHARLOTTE HAD THAT FLASH FLOOD 
BOUT. 
THEY DIDN'T HAVE AS MUCH RIVER 
FLOODING BUT AGAIN, SO YOU'LL 
BE SEEING BOTH FLASH FLOOD 
CONCERN DURING THE DAY THURSDAY 
AND ADDITIONALLY, THAT RIVER 
FLOODING CONCERN THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY AS WELL. 
>> BOY, THOSE PEOPLE MUST BE SO 
TIRED OF IT RIGHT NOW. 
>> FOR SURE. 
AND AT THE COAST, CHARLESTON 
REALLY DODGED THE BULLET FROM 
FLORENCE. 
THEY WERE JUST OUTSIDE OF IT. 
BUT THEY'LL GET SOME STORM 
SURGE OUT OF THAT. 
A POTENTIAL FOR MODERATE 
FLOODING. 
YOU CAN SEE BETWEEN THE TWO 
STORMS, THE CAROLINAS I THINK 
HAVE HAD THEIR FILL OF THE 
TROPICS. 
>> AND TELL US DAVID. 
IS THIS IT? 
WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
FLORENCE, WE THOUGHT THIS HAS 
TO BE THE END OF THE HURRICANE 
SEASON. 
NOW WE HAVE MICHAEL. 
THIS IS REALLY THE END RIGHT? 
>> FLORENCE HAPPENED AT THE 
LITERAL PEAK OF HURRICANE 
SEASON. 
THERE'S A SECOND HIGH. 
WE'RE A LITTLE AFTER THAT 
POINT. 
BUT HURRICANE SEASON RUNS INTO 
NOVEMBER. 
WE SHIFT INTO GULF OF MEXICO 
STORMS. 
YOU GET LESS OF THE RUNNERS OUT 
FROM THE MAIN DEVELOPMENT 
REGION IN THE CARIBBEAN. 
BUT REMEMBER, SANDY HAPPENED AT 
THE END OF OCTOBER. 
IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE TO GET 
THEM. 
THIS WILL CLEAR IT OUT FOR A 
LITTLE BIT. 
BUT, THERE WERE ALREADY SOME 
SIGNS AND MODELING WE COULD SEE 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. 
NO REASON TO LET YOUR GUARD 
DOWN. 
WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING THIS 
STRONG, I WOULD HOPE NOT. 
>> I HOPE THE CAROLINAS GET A 
BREAK AFTER THIS. 
>> I HOPE THE ENTIRE UNITED 
STATES. 
 
>> INDEED. 
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> SURE THING. 
>>> AND, HILLARY LANE JOINS US 
NOW FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH 
FLORIDA. 
WHAT ARE YOU EXPERIENCING 
THERE? 
>> Reporter: A VERY DIFFERENT 
SIGHT COMPARED TO AN HOUR AGO. 
THE WORST OF THE STORM HAS 
PASSED US. 
LIGHT RAIN AND THE PALM TREES 
ARE BLOWING. 
BEFORE THAT AROUND NOON TODAY, 
THERE WAS WIND WHIPPING ACROSS, 
WE COULDN'T EVEN COME OUTSIDE 
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE TOO 
DANGEROUS. 
IF YOU CAN SEE BEHIND ME, THIS 
ROOF, YOU CAN SEE IT BLOWING IN 
THE WIND A LITTLE BIT. 
EARLIER TODAY, IT POPPED OFF A 
BIT. 
SO MANY SIGNS HANGING ON A 
DIAGONAL. 
EARLIER TODAY, IT WAS A VERY, 
VERY SCARY SCENE. 
AS IT PASSES THROUGH NOW, MUCH 
CALMER. 
>> IS THE AREA WHERE YOU ARE 
PRETTY MUCH FULLY EVACUATED? 
>> Reporter: YES. 
MUCH OF THE AREA, WE WERE AT A 
HOTEL LAST NIGHT IN A MANDATORY 
EVACUATION ZONE SO WE LEFT. 
BUT MANY PEOPLE THERE DIDN'T 
WANT TO LEAVE. 
THEY HAD DIFFERENT REASONS. 
SOME HAD ELDERLY FAMILY MEMBERS 
OR WANTED TO RIDE THE STORM 
OUT. 
SO MANY THOUGH THEY WERE IN THE 
MANDATORY EVACUATION AREAS 
DECIDED TO STAY. 
>> WHAT IS THE WORST OF WHAT 
YOU'VE SEEN NOW THAT THE STORM 
HAS PASSED? 
IS IT FLOODING PEOPLE HAVE TO 
DEAL WITH THERE? 
>> Reporter: I WOULD SAY THAT 
IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
HAVE TO DO ESPECIALLY WHEN IT 
COMES TO TOMORROW WHEN PEOPLE 
GO OUTSIDE AND BEGIN TO 
REBUILD. 
WE SEE A LOT OF DAMAGE TO 
STRUCTURES. 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME HOMES HAVE 
BEEN COMPLETELY LEVELED. 
SOME NEWER STRUCTURES SO WHEN 
PEOPLE COME BACK, THEY ARE 
COMING BACK TO QUITE A BIT THEY 
NEED TO REBUILD. 
>> HILLARY, WE HEAR THIS IS THE 
STRONGEST HURRICANE THAT HAS 
MADE LANDFALL IN THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. 
WHAT ARE FOLKS THERE TELLING 
YOU ABOUT THIS? 
HAVE THEY JUST BEEN TERRIFIED 
THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE? 
>> Reporter: YEAH, THEY SAY 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING. 
NOW THE INTERESTING PART PEOPLE 
ARE SAYING IS THEY DIDN'T HAVE 
TIME TO PREPARE. 
YOU KNOW WITH FLORENCE, 
PREDICTERS WERE SAYING THIS WAS 
GOING TO BE A STORM FOR A WEEK, 
BUT PEOPLE HERE DIDN'T REALLY 
KNOW ABOUT IT, IT FORMED SO 
QUICKLY. 
SO THEY WERE GETING THE 
MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDER THIS 
WEEK. 
SO, I THINK THE BIGGEST THING 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS FOR SUCH A 
POWERFUL GIGANTIC STORM, THEY 
DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO 
PREPARE. 
>> NO, INDEED. 
AND THAT IS WHAT MADE IT SO 
SCARY FOR SO MANY PEOPLE. 
IT CERTAINLY BUILT STRENGTH 
MORE QUICKLY THAN ANYONE COULD 
IMAGINE. 
HOW MANY HOMES DO YOU THINK 
THERE ARE WITHOUT POWER? 
ARE YOU SEEING A LOT OF POWER 
OUTAGES WHERE YOU ARE? 
>> WE ARE. 
WE'RE HEARING THERE WILL BE 
150,000 TO 200,000 PEOPLE 
WITHOUT POWER. 
WE LOST IT EARLIER BEFORE THE 
WORST OF THE STORM CAME 
THROUGH. 
WE HEARD FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR 
SAYING THAT THE NUMBER ONE 
PRIORITY IS TO GET THE 
ELECTRICITY BACK ON. 
IT'S CRUCIAL WHEN IT COMES TO 
BUILDING. 
SO, A LOT OF PEOPLE, UP TO 
200,000 PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT 
POWER. 
THAT WILL REALLY HINDER THE 
REBUILDING EFFORTS. 
>> HILLARY LANE, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE. 
STAY SAFE. 
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK, BUT BEFORE WE DO, WE 
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT AN 
EXCITING CHANGE COMING TO CBSN. 
BEGINNING ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 
15, WE ARE ADDING A NEW HOUR OF 
LIVE COVERAGE TO OUR LINEUP 
BEGINNING AT 7:00 A.M. 
ANNE-MARIE GREEN AND VLADIMIR 
DUTHIERS WILL HELP YOU GET A 
HEAD START ON YOUR DAY BY 
BRINGING YOU THE LATEST NEWS 
FROM AROUND THE WORLD WITH OUR 
GLOBAL TEAM OF CORRESPONDENTS. 
WE'LL DIG DEEP INTO THE STORIES 
THAT MATTER MOST TO YOU WITH 
WELL RESEARCHED UNBIASED 
INSIGHT AND PERSPECTIVE. 
DON'T MISS ANNE-MARIE GREEN AND 
VLADIMIR DUTHIERS MONDAY 
MORNING FOR THE ALL NEW CBSN 
A.M. 
>> THE DOW FELL MORE THAN 800 
POINTS TODAY. 
ANALYSTS SAY INVESTORS ARE 
WORRIED ABOUT RISING INTEREST 
RATES. 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IT HAS 
DIPPED BELOW 26,000 IN A MONTH 
AND THE LOWEST SINCE APRIL. 
FOR MORE, YAHOO FINANCE 
REPORTER SCOTT JOINS ME ON THE 
PHONE. 
SCOTT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
BEING WITH US. 
WHAT EXACTLY IS DRIVING THIS 
SELL-OFF? 
DO CHINA TARIFFS HAVE SOMETHING 
TO DO WITH IT? 
>> NO, I WOULD SAY THE INTEREST 
RATE WORRIES ARE THE MAIN 
CULPRIT. 
INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN A FEAR 
MOST OF THE YEAR. 
INVESTORS HAVE BEEN EXPECTING 
YIELDS IN THE TEN YEAR TREASURY 
TO RISE AS THE FEDERAL RESERVE 
HIKES INTEREST RATES. 
THEY HIKED RATES THREE TIMES 
THIS YEAR, THEY'RE GEARING UP 
FOR A FOURTH ONE IN DECEMBER. 
ALTHOUGH WITH THE MARKET 
VOLATILITY THAT WE'RE SEEING 
RIGHT NOW, YOU'LL HAVE 
INVESTORS START TO WONDER IF 
THE FED CHAIRMAN WILL GO AHEAD 
WITH THAT DECEMBER HIKE. 
OBVIOUSLY TIME WILL TELL. 
WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MONTHS 
UNTIL THAT POINT. 
>> AND SCOTT, YOU FOLLOW THE 
MARKETS. 
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. 
HOW MUCH DID THIS SELL-OFF 
SURPRISE YOU? 
IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. 
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU SEE A 
SELL-OFF LIKE THIS, THERE TEND 
TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF BALANCE 
AT THE END OF THE DAY. 
BUYERS COMING IN FOR THE DEALS. 
WE DIDN'T SEE THAT TODAY. 
>> HERE AT YAHOO FINANCE, WE 
HAVE BEEN COVERING THE MARKET 
SELL-OFF ALL DAY AND THAT'S AN 
IMPORTANT POINT. 
WE DID NOT SEE ANY BUYER COME 
IN AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH 
THIS PANIC SELLING SO TO SPEAK. 
THE DOW WAS DOWN 500 POINTS IN 
THE EARLY AFTERNOON. 
AND AS THAT 3:30 LEVEL 
APPROACHED, 3:30 P.M., INTO THE 
4:00 P.M. 
CLOSE, THAT'S WHEN YOU SAW SOME 
OF THE BIGGEST DECLINES IN THE 
DOW TODAY. 
LEADING 831 POINTS. 
DECLINE, WHAT IS INTERESTING IS 
YIELDS ON THE TREASURE YIELDS, 
THEY FELL AT THE VERY END OF 
THE SESSION. 
MEANING THAT INVESTORS TOOK 
MONEY OUT OF STOCKS AS WE KNOW. 
BUT, ACTUALLY PUT THEM INTO 
BONDS. 
THE SAFE HAVEN PLACE. 
INVESTORS HAD BEEN BUYING 
BONDS. 
>> SO NOBODY IS JUST SITTING ON 
THEIR CASH OR PUTTING IT INTO 
GOLD JUST YET. 
>> YEAH. 
I THINK YOU HAVE PLENTY OF 
INVESTORS KIND OF SITTING ON 
THEIR HAPPENS GOING INTO CASH. 
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT 
THE S&P 500 IS STILL UP 4% FOR 
THE YEAR AND WE COULD END UP 
WELL BEYOND THAT LEVEL. 
WE ARE AT 2785. 
AND, THE OTHER THING TO 
REMEMBER IS OCTOBER IS 
TYPICALLY A VOLATILE MONTH FOR 
THE MARKET. 
YOU GO BACK HISTORICALLY, WE'VE 
HAD MANY CORRECTIONS THROUGHOUT 
THE YEARS DURING THE MONTH OF 
OCTOBER. 
>> SO, SCOTT, HOW CONCERNED DO 
YOU THINK INVESTORS SHOULD BE 
OR SHOULD THEY WAKE UP TOMORROW 
MORNING AND START BUYING UP THE 
DEALS? 
>> Reporter: WELL, I THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT HOW SOME 
OF THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS 
PERFORMED OVERNIGHT. 
AND, WE'LL KIND OF REASSESS IN 
THE MORNING. 
SEE WHERE FUTURES ARE. 
SEE WHERE EUROPE IS. 
SEE WHERE ASIA IS. 
BUT I WOULD EXPECT ADDITIONAL 
VOLATILITY INTO TOMORROW JUST 
GIVEN HOW WE DIDN'T SEE ANY 
BUYERS COME IN AT THE END OF 
THE TRADING SESSION TODAY. 
THE OTHER THING TO POINT OUT IS 
THAT INVESTORS ARE CONSTANTLY 
TRYING TO REMAIN DIVERSIFIED. 
SO, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON 
WITH INTEREST RATES AND YOU 
HAVE TO WONDER WHAT DO INTEREST 
RATES HAVE TO DO WITH THE PRICE 
TO EARNINGS MULTIPLE OF SAY 
PROCTOR AND GAMBLE. 
STOCKS THAT WILL DO WELL 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT'S GOING ON 
IN THE MARKET. 
WE'LL KEEP BUYING OUR MEDICINE, 
TOOTH PASTE, STAPLE ITEMS. 
SO WE'LL START TO SEE SOME OF 
THOSE DEFENSIVE PLAYS IN THE 
MARKET CREEP UP. 
>> ALL RIGHT SCOTT. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH TANYA. 
>>> LET'S TURN BACK YOU TO 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTING 
METEOROLOGIST JEFF IS HERE. 
>> THE STORM HAD WINDS OF 1 155 
MILES WHEN IT CAME ASHORE. 
THERE WAS 10 TO 12 FEET OF 
STORM SURGE. 
SOME PLACES I BET WILL CONFIRM 
15 PLUS FEET OF STORM SURGE. 
ENBELIEVABLE VIDEO THERE. 
MEXICO BEACH WAS RIGHT IN THE 
CENTER OF THE STORM. 
THAT MEANS THEY SAW THE 
STRONGEST OF WINDS. 
I SAW A WIND GUST REPORT AT THE 
AIR FORCE BASE OF 129 MILES AN 
HOUR. 
ONCE YOU GET PAST THAT POINT, 
THE SENSORS FAIL IF THERE ARE 
SENSORS IN THE PART OF THE 
STORM. 
THIS IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST 
STORMS WE HAVE SEEN STRIKE THE 
UNITED STATES. 
>> YOU LOOK AT THESE IMAGES AND 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE 
FLOODING. 
YOU CAN SEE WHOLE STRUCTURES 
ARE DEMOLISHED. 
ROOFS HAVE BEEN BLOWN OFF. 
>> IT LOOKS LIKE THE DAMAGE 
AFTER A TSUNAMI. 
RIGHT? 
>> YES IT DOES. 
THIS IS STORM SURGE THAT WILL 
GO DOWN BY THE END OF THE DAY? 
>> YES, SOME TIME LATER THIS 
EVENING. 
THE NEXT HIGH TIDE CYCLE IS 
THIS EVENING. 
ONCE THAT GOES DOWN, THE WATER 
WILL GO OUT. 
IT'S PROBABLY GETTING SLIGHTLY 
BETTER BUT IT WON'T BE 
COMPLETELY GONE UNTIL TOMORROW 
MORNING. 
>> THESE DEADLY PROJECTILES. 
ANYTHING THAT ISN'T COMPLETELY 
BATTENED DOWN AS YOU WOULD ON A 
SHIP. 
IT'S JUST DEADLY. 
>> IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THAT 
AS THE WINDS GO UP, THE FORCE 
GOES UP EXPONENTIALLY. 
IT'S NOT LIKE IF YOU HAVE A 
STORM OF 75 MILES AN HOUR 
MAGNITUDE AND A STORM OF 150 
MILES AN HOUR THAT THE STORM OF 
150 IS TWICE AS STRONG. 
IT'S NOT. 
IT'S EXPONENTIALLY STRONGER. 
THE AMOUNT OF FORCE AND THE 
AMOUNT OF DAMAGE IT CAUSES IS 
EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER. 
>> THE IMAGES WE ARE SEEING OUT 
OF MEXICO CITY ARE BECAUSE 
PEOPLE WERE SAFE ON HIGH 
FLOORS. 
>> YES. 
AND YOU LOOK AT THE DESTRUCTION 
ON THE GROUND. 
AND YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF THOSE 
PEOPLE GOT OUT IN TIME. 
>> YOU HAVE TO HOPE. 
YOU HAVE TO PRAY. 
AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN 
THE HIGHER BUILDINGS, THEY'RE 
NOT GOING TO BE STUCK THERE YOU 
SAY BECAUSE THE WATER WILL 
EVENTUALLY PULL BACK OUT TO 
SEA. 
>> SO, FOR ANYBODY IN THE PATH 
OF THE WORST OF THE DAMAGE, 
REALLY ANYWHERE NEAR THE 
HURRICANE FORCE WINDS, AND 
BEYOND THAT TO BE HONEST WITH 
YOU, THERE WILL BE POWER LINES 
DOWN, TREES DOWN. 
PLACES YOU CANNOT PASS THROUGH 
THE ROADWAYS. 
DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOUSE OR 
BUILDING AND GO VERY FAR 
WITHOUT THE AUTHORITIES SAYING 
IT'S SAFE. 
THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE 
ELECTROCUTED BY FALLING POWER 
LINES. 
>> WHAT IS THE LATEST ON THE 
POWER? 
WE HEARD OVER A QUARTER OF A 
PEOPLE ARE NOW WITHOUT POWER. 
>> TRADITIONAL AFTER THESE 
STORMS IT TAKES TWO TO THREE 
WEEKS TO RESTORE POWER TO 
EVERYBODY. 
I'VE SEEN IT MYSELF. 
LIVED IN FLORIDA 15 YEARS. 
SEEN A LOT OF HURRICANES. 
SOME PEOPLE GET THEIR POWER 
BACK IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. 
OTHERS MIGHT TAKE TWO WEEKS 
AGO. 
>> DOESN'T EVERYBODY IN FLORIDA 
HAVE A BACKUP GENERATOR? 
>> IT'S NOT TRUE. 
IT'S HARD. 
FIRST OF ALL, THERE ARE ONLY SO 
MANY BACKUP GENERATORS TO BE 
HAD AND THEY COST A LOT OF 
MONEY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T 
HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY THEM. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF 
THESE IMAGES HERE. 
THIS IS JUST INCREDIBLE. 
THIS IS LIVE FROM PANAMA CITY 
BEACH. 
ABSOLUTE DEVASTATION. 
TREES KNOCKED DOWN. 
>>YOU CAN SEE HOW THEY WERE 
TWISTED AND TURNED. 
THE TREES WEREN'T KNOCKED OVER, 
THEY WERE TWISTED AND TURNED 
AROUND. 
>> OH MY GOODNESS. 
THE STRENGTH OF THOSE WINDS IS 
UNIMAGINABLE. 
>> AND IF YOU LOOK, THE EERIEST 
SIGHT IS NO LEAVES ON THE 
TREES. 
BECAUSE IT STRIPS THE TREES OF 
LEAVES SO IT'S VERY EERIE AND 
SUBLIMINAL WHEN YOU WALK INTO A 
SCENE LIKE THAT. 
YOU LOOK AT IT AND SAY 
SOMETHING DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT 
BEYOND ALL THE DESTRUCTION. 
IT'S BECAUSE ALL THE LEAVES ARE 
GONE. 
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT. 
I THOUGHT WOW, THAT DOES LOOK 
SORT OF APOCALYPTIC. 
THAT'S THE REASON. 
>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER 
TODAY. 
THIS IS LIKE THE DAMAGE OF THE 
MOORE OKLAHOMA TORNADO. 
THIS REALLY MIMICKED A BIG 
TORNADO. 
A BUZZ SAW TORNADO. 
>> THAT'S STILL A DANGER HERE? 
ARE WE EXPECTING TORNADOES NOW? 
>> DEFINITELY. 
WE HAVE PROBABLY SEEN A NUMBER 
OF TORNADOES AND THERE HAVE 
BEEN SOME. 
BUT IT'S HARD TO TELL THE 
DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY IN GROUND 
ZERO FOR THE STORM OF WHAT WAS 
THE TORNADO DAMAGE AND WHAT 
WASN'T. 
BUT AS THE STORM CONTINUES TO 
MOVE NORTH OVER I-10 NOW. 
ACROSS THE GEORGIA FLORIDA 
LINE, AS IT MOVES NORTH, IT'S 
GOING TO PRODUCE PROBABLY MORE 
TORNADOES THAN IT HAS. 
AS IT STARTS TO UNRAVEL A 
LITTLE BIT, YOU SEE THE OUTER 
BANDS BEGIN TO SPIN JUST A 
LITTLE BIT MORE IN SOME CASES 
SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY PRODUCE 
MORE TORNADOES. 
SO, FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, 
TORNADOES WILL BE A BIG THREAT. 
THE BIGGEST THREAT WILL BE THE 
FLOODING RAIN IN GEORGIA, AND 
THE CAROLINAS AS WELL. 
IT WILL BE BETH FLASH FLOODING 
AND ALSO RIVER FLOODING AS 
WELL. 
I WAS CHECKING THE LATEST STATS 
ON SOME OF THE RIVERS IN SOUTH 
AND NORTH CAROLINA. 
A LOT OF THEM WERE CLOSE TO, 
YOU KNOW, NORMAL OR AT LEAST 
NOT IN FLOOD STAGE, BUT THERE 
WERE A FEW OF THEM IN FLOOD 
STAGE HEADED BACK TO AT LEAST 
MODERATE AND IN SOME CASES 
MAJOR FLOOD STAGE. 
>> THE LAST THING PEOPLE NEED. 
JEFF, THANK YOU. 
WE HOPE EVERYONE IN FLORIDA IS 
SAFE. 
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MUCH MORE 
CBSN. 
DON'T GO AWAY. 
>> WE WANT TO TURN TO OUR 
TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE WTCE FOR 
MORE COVERAGE ON THE STORM. 
>> YOU COULD SEE WIND GUSTS IN 
EXCESS OF 75 MILES AN HOUR. 
THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY CAUSE MORE 
POWER OUTAGES FOR THOSE OF YOU 
WHO HAVE POWER. 
THERE WILL BE WINDY CONDITIONS 
AND RAIN HERE. 
MORE BREAKS STARTING TO FORM. 
YOU MAY NO HAVE THE SUSTAINED 
WINDS LASTING AS LONG, BUT FOR 
THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO, FAIRLY 
WIDESPREAD SUSTAINED WINDS 30 
TO 40 MILES AN HOUR RANGE. 
THE WINDS ARE GETTING A LITTLE 
BIT LIGHTER TOO. 
THE WATER HAS BEEN PILING UP. 
WE STILL HAVE THE ON SHORE FLOW 
KEEPING THE STORM SURGE MACHINE 
GOING. 
FOR AT LEAST A FEW MORE HOURS. 
THEN THE RAINFALL WILL 
GRADUALLY START TO COME APART 
TOO. 
NOW, IF WE COULD SWITCH OVER TO 
MAX 2, I WILL GO AHEAD AND TALK 
ABOUT A FEW OTHER THINGS GOING 
ON. 
SATELLITE VIEW, THIS IMAGERY, 
WE'RE STILL GETTING AND YOU CAN 
SEE. 
HAS IT MADE LANDFALL NEAR 
MEXICO BEACH? 
IT MOVED  THROUGH CALHOUN 
COUNTY. 
THIS TAKES THE STRONG WINDS 
RIGHT THROUGH MILLER COUNTY AND 
EARLY COUNTY AND BAKER AND 
DAUGHTERTY. 
SO, IF YOU ARE ALONG AND WEST 
OF THE FLINT RIVER, THAT'S 
PROBABLY A PRETTY GOOD BOUNDARY 
FOR THE STRONGEST WINDS NEAR 
THAT EYE WALL. 
AS YOU GO JUST A LITTLE FURTHER 
EAST, THE WINDS WILL DECREASE. 
BUT, THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO 
SUDDENLY DECREASE. 
THEY WILL BE QUITE STRONG 
ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA. 
ONE THING ROB AN I WERE JUST 
TALKING ABOUT IS THIS LAST 
LITTLE BIT OF CONVECTION THAT 
DEVELOPED PRETTY FAR REMOVED 
FROM THE CENTER DOWN TOWARD THE 
SOUTHEAST. 
THAT IS STILL ROLLING UP SOME 
VERY STRONG WINDS AT LEAST THE 
MID AND UPPER LEVELS ACROSS 
LIBERTY AND LEON COUNTIES. 
AS THAT ROTATES UP AND AROUND, 
THAT COULD PRODUCE SOME 
DAMAGING WIND GUSTS. 
SO, THE WINDS MAY BE GETTINGER 
IN SPOTS BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY 
NOT SAFE AND THIS WILL CAUSE A 
FEW MORE POWER OUTAGES. 
THE DRIER AIR IS THE STUFF OUT 
HERE. 
TOWARD THE WEST. 
THAT IS GRADUALLY GETTING IN 
HERE. 
IT WILL NOT SUDDENLY TAKE OVER 
IT AND MAKE IT FALL APART. 
THAT WOULD BE NICE. 
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING THE 
HAPPEN. 
THAT'S PART OF THE COLD FRONT 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE OUT TO THE 
EAST, THE COLD FRONT TO THE 
WEST ACTING LIKE A SQUEEZE PLAY 
THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE 
HURRICANE ALL TOWARD THE 
NORTHEAST. 
IT WILL STAY A HURRICANE AT 
LEAST THROUGH THE MID EVENING 
HOURS. 
LIKELY UNTIL THE 11:00 
ADVISORY. 
THEN IT WILL BE DOWNGRADED. 
WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE WINDS THAT 
ARE QUITE TO THE LEVEL OF WHAT 
THE ADVISORY SAYS. 
BUT, WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN 
WINDS AT LEAST IN GUSTS OF 100 
TO 130 FROM MARIANA ALL THE WAY 
TO THE COAST. 
THERE'S STILL THE POTENTIAL FOR 
AT LEAST HURRICANE FORCE WIND 
GUSTS. 
75 MILES AN HOUR. 
THROUGHOUT PARTS OF SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA. 
THE FUTURECAST STILL SHOWS 
WIDESPREAD AREA OF 45 TO 55 
MILES AN HOUR WINDS. 
THESE ARE SUSTAINED WINDS WITH 
GUSTS 20 TO 30 MILES AN HOUR 
ABOVE THAT. 
MOVING TO THE MID EVENING 
HOURS, YOU SEE THE STRONGER 
WINDS MOVING PRIMARILY OVER TO 
THOMAS COUNTY. 
WORTH. 
THEN, NOTICE THE LIGHT WINDS 
NEAR ALBANY. 
THAT'S CLOSER TO WHERE THE 
CENTER IS FORECAST TO BE. 
THEN IT CONTINUES TO GET BETTER 
AND BETTER. 
15 TO 25 MILES AN HOUR WIND 
RANGE. 
AND THE WESTERLY WIND WILL KICK 
IN AND HELP THINGS OUT. 
THE SURGE, WE'VE PEAKED AS FAR 
AS THE SURGE. 
WE'RE ALREADY PAST THE HIGH 
TIDE. 
AND, STILL GETTING NEAR HIGH 
TIDE. 
BUT, THE WORST OF THE ON SHORE 
WIND HAS DEPARTED. 
REGARDLESS OF ALL THAT, A WHOLE 
LOT OF WATER GOT SHOVED UP INTO 
APALACHICOLA BAY. 
BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE OF IT, IT 
HAS NOWHERE TO GO. 
IT WILL NOT GO ANYWHERE IN A 
HURRY. 
THERE IS EXTREME STORM SURGE 
FLOODING GOING ON. 
IT WILL TAKE UNTIL TOMORROW OR 
OVERNIGHT AS THE WINDS SHIFT 
DIRECTION TO ALLOW THE WATER TO 
START MOVING BACK OUT. 
SO IT'S STILL NOT SAFE AT ALL 
ALONG THE COASTAL AREAS TO 
VENTURE OUT UNTIL WE START TO 
SEE THE WATER RECEDING. 
THE LATEST REPORTS WE HAVE ARE 
HOURS OLD AND HAD NINE TO TEN 
FEET OF STORM SURGE. 
THE RAINFALL AMOUNTS, THESE ARE 
NOT UPDATED YET. 
BUT, WE'VE SEEN THREE TO SIX 
INCHES OF RAIN OVER WESTERN 
AREAS. 
I COULD EASILY SEE ANOTHER 
COUPLE OF INCHES OF RAIN 
FALLING IN THAT REGION CLOSER 
TO THE CENTER AND UP INTO SOUTH 
GEORGIA. 
LIGHTER AMOUNTS FURTHER EAST. 
A POTENTIAL FOR THE RAIN BANDS 
TO CAUSE FLASH FLOODING SO THE 
COASTAL WINDS ARE GETTING 
BETTER. 
THE INLAND WINDS ARE SHIFTING A 
LITTLE MORE FROM THE WESTERN 
HALF OF THE BIG BEND. 
MORE INTO SOUTHWEST GEORGIA OF 
SEEING THOSE 50 TO 60 MILES AN 
HOUR GUSTS PERHAPS TOPPING 75. 
STILL THE HEAVY RAIN. 
THE THREAT THAT WE HAVEN'T 
TALKED MUCH ABOUT IS STILL A 
FEW TORNADOES. 
FORTUNATELY, THAT HAS NOT BEEN 
A MAJOR ISSUE. 
BUT EVERY LANDFALL SYSTEM HAS A 
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT THREAT. 
FOR THE BANDS REMOVED FROM THE 
CENTER OF CREATING TORNADOES SO 
WE'LL STAY ON GUARD FOR THAT 
POSSIBILITY. 
THAT INCLUDES EASTERN AREAS 
WHERE YOU MAY HAVE ONLY SEEN 
SHOWERS AND BREEZY CONDITIONS. 
YOU HAVE TO MOVE TO A PLACE OF 
SAFETY IF A TORNADO WARNING IS 
ISSUED. 
AND THE COASTAL FLOODING 
CONTINUING A FEW MORE HOURS. 
ALL RIGHT, SO WE ADAPTED, WE 
SHOWED YOU THE RADAR AND 
EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON. 
I'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND 
TOSS IT BACK TO YOU GUYS AND 
I'LL BE BACK IN A LITTLE BIT. 
>> THANKS MIKE. 
WE HAVE BEEN SCOURING OUR 
PHONES. 
LOOKING AT SOME TWEETS FROM 
DAVID BISHOP. 
HE USED TO BE A REPORTER HERE 
YEARS AGO BACK IN THE DAY AS 
THEY SAY. 
HE'S REPORTING THAT THE ROOF OF 
THE MARIANA POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HAS BLOWN OFF. 
AND HAS SENT SOME PICTURES OF 
DAMAGE THERE IN DUN TOWN 
MARIANA. 
THAT'S ABOUT AN HOUR WEST OF 
HERE. 
GETTING SOME STRONG WINDS 
THERE. 
>> AND WE'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT 
OF PICTURES AND VIDEO FROM YOU 
AND OTHER VIEWERS ACROSS THE 
REGION, WE HOPE YOU WILL SHARE 
MORE OF THOSE IN THE COMING 
MINUTES AND HOURS INCLUDING 
FROM SHONDA KNIGHT. 
SOME DAMAGE TO HER OWN HOME. 
UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE THAT. 
AND WE WANT TO CHECK IN WITH 
ABBY WALTON WHERE THE SHELTER 
CONTINUES TO BE CROWDED AT THE 
HIGH SCHOOL. 
ABBY? 
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 
I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT 
SHONDA. 
SHE AND HER FAMILY ARE NOW HERE 
AT THE SCHOOL. 
THE REASON YOU SEE LIGHTS AND 
THINGS ON, WE'RE ON A GENERATOR 
NOW. 
WE LOST POWER, WE LOST POWER A 
WHILE AGO. 
SO WE ARE ON A BACKUP 
GENERATOR. 
SO PEOPLE A LITTLE WORRIED AS 
THEIR PHONE BATTERIES START TO 
DIE. 
THAT SORT OF THING. 
YOU CAN SEE THERE WERE PEOPLE 
IN THE AREA NOW. 
THEY CAN GET SNACKS. 
THE SNACKS ARE PROVIDED. 
PEOPLE GETTING CRACKERS AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT. 
DO WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, WE DID 
HAVE ONE FAMILY THAT WAS 
REMOVED FROM OUR AREA. 
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE REMOVED 
THE FAMILY. 
I'M TOLD THAT'S BECAUSE THE 
FATHER WAS BEING A LITTLE 
DISORDERLY AND NOT VERY 
NEIGHBORLY TO SOME OF THE 
PEOPLE HERE SO THEY FELT LIKE 
IT WAS BEST FOR LCSO TO COME 
AND REMOVE THAT FAMILY. 
IT WASN'T A BIG SCENE, BUT THEY 
FELT IT NECESSARY TO REMOVE 
THAT FAMILY. 
SO NOW, EVERYBODY KIND OF JUST 
SITS AND WAITS AND I DO HAVE TO 
SAY EDEN AND JULIE, AS THIS 
STORM IS PROGRESSING AND PEOPLE 
ARE NOW BEING ABLE TO SEE 
PICTURES ON THEIR PHONES AND 
GET TEXTS FROM FAMILIES 
THROUGHOUT THE AREA, YOU ARE 
STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE GO HOW'S 
YOUR FAMILY? 
ARE YOU OKAY? 
HOW IS YOUR HOUSE? 
AND SOME OF THE PICTURES THAT 
WE'RE SEEING FROM PEOPLE'S CELL 
PHONES AND TEXTS THEY'RE 
SHOWING US ARE JUST VERY 
DEVASTATING. 
AND SO, I THINK THE BIG MESSAGE 
RIGHT NOW IS LOVE ONE ANOTHER 
AND THIS COMMUNITY IS SO FULL 
OF LOVE. 
WE'LL HAVE TO HOLD ONTO ONE 
ANOTHER IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT 
TIME. 
>> THE STRESS OF THIS STORM IS 
INCREDIBLE. 
THE NOT KNOWING WHAT'S 
HAPPENING AT THEIR HOUSES I'M 
SURE IS ON TOP OF THEIR LINES. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
ABSOLUTELY JULIE. 
AND SO, THEY JUST ARE KIND OF 
SEEING WHAT NEIGHBORS ARE 
SHOWING THEM. 
NEIGHBORS THAT HAVE STAYED AND 
KIND OF WONDERING WILL THIS BE 
MY HOUSE. 
BESIDES THIS BUILDING THERE WAS 
ANOTHER BUILDING WHERE SEVERAL 
PEOPLE ARE OVER THERE WITH 
THEIR PETS AND THERE ARE 
SEVERAL HUNDRED PETS OVER 
THERE. 
AND WHEN I WAS THERE A LITTLE 
BIT EARLIER BEFORE THE STORM 
REALLY GOT GOING, THOSE POOR 
LITTLE ANIMALS WERE AS YOU CAN 
IMAGINE PRETTY STRESSED OUT. 
AND THE LEON COUNTY SHELTER 
DOING A GREAT JOB AT MAKING 
SURE EVERYBODY, ALL THE ANIMALS 
STAY SAFE DURING THE STORM. 
SO AGAIN, EVERYBODY HERE IS 
JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF 
IT AT THIS POINT. 
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 
BACK HERE, PEOPLE ARE GETTING 
KIND OF TIRED. 
TAKING MORE NAPS. 
THAT SORT OF THING AS THIS DAY 
PROGRESSES. 
>> OKAY ABBY, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SPIRIT 
OF LOVE AND THE SPIRIT OF 
HELPING EACH OTHER. 
THAT IS SO EVIDENCE IN THIS 
COMMUNITY ALL YEARLONG. 
I KNOW IN THE YEARS PAST, WE 
HAVE WATCHED OUR NEIGHBORS TO 
THE WEST BE FOLKS EVACUATING 
FROM KATRINA CAME HERE IN THEIR 
TIME OF NEED AND IN SOME CASES 
STAYED. 
NOW IT'S OUR TURN, WE'RE SO 
THANKFUL NOT ONLY FOR EACH 
OTHER AND THE SUPPORT WE CAN 
PROVIDE BUT ALL THE PEOPLE 
COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITY FROM 
OTHER COMMUNITIES TO HELP US AT 
THIS TIME. 
>> AND YOU MENTIONED THE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL. 
THE STRESS, THE ANXIETY. 
THAT IS REAL. 
AND THAT CAN HAVE LASTING 
EFFECTS. 
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE CRISIS 
COUNSELORS BEING BROUGHT IN. 
PEOPLE SEEKING HELP FROM THEIR 
RELIGION, THEIR FAITH, OTHER 
MEANS. 
IF YOU SEE THIS KIND OF DAMAGE 
AND YOU DEAL WITH THIS 
SITUATION, YOU DON'T JUST TOUGH 
IT OUT. 
MAYBE NOT. 
IT'S A TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE AND 
IT CAN BE REALLY HARD TO MOVE 
ON, TO CLEAN UP, THERE ARE SO 
MANY STRESSES AND SO MANY 
FACTORS INVOLVED SO THAT'S 
IMPORTANT IN THE DAYS TO COME. 
>> NOT JUST RESTORING POWER AND 
CLEANING UP, BUT RESTORING 
YOURSELF. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
>>> WELL, ALICIA TURNER IS IN 
DOWNTOWN TALLAHASSEE. 
WHAT DO YOU SEE? 
>> Reporter: WELL, EARLIER 
TODAY, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
HOW SOME OF THE ROADS HAD 
ALREADY BEEN BLOCKED OFF BY THE 
DEBRIS. 
AND THAT NUMBER CONTINUING TO 
GROW. 
NOW, WE'RE ON VIRGINIA NEAR 
DUVALL NEAR DOWNTOWN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
YOU CAN SEE WHERE A LIMB HAS 
SNAPPED OFF A TREE AND IS 
BLOCKING THE ROADWAY HERE. 
WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE TRYING TO 
GET THROUGH. 
PEOPLE TRYING TO ASSESS SOME OF 
THE DAMAGE. 
AS WE HAVE BEEN OUT, WE'VE SEEN 
HOW THE DEBRIS IS IN THE 
STREETS. 
WIND GUSTS STILL COMING 
THROUGH. 
YOU CAN LOOK AT IT AND SEE HOW 
THE WIND IS BLOWING REALLY 
HEAVY AND THE AREA RIGHT NOW. 
SO, THERE'S STILL POTENTIAL FOR 
MORE DAMAGE TO HAPPEN. 
BUT, THIS IS JUST REALTIME HOW 
THIS DAMAGE IS HAPPENING AS WE 
SPEAK. 
AND SOME OF THESE ROADS JUST 
COMPLETELY BLOCKED OFF. 
IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE OUT, 
DON'T. 
JUST LOOKING BEHIND ME AND THE 
PICTURES WE HAVE ON OUR WEBSITE 
AND THE THINGS PEOPLE HAVE 
TWEETED OUT. 
JUST AS YOU MENTIONED, THE ROAD 
TO RECOVERY, IT'S GOING TO BE A 
LONG ONE. 
JUST LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 
DAMAGE AND SOME OF THE THINGS 
THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. 
SEEING THE ROOF EARLIER TODAY 
OFF ADAMS STREET. 
WE'RE OUT AND ABOUT STAYING 
SAFE AND SHOWING YOU SOME OF 
THE DAMAGE THAT IS BEING CAUSED 
RIGHT HERE IN TALLAHASSEE. 
MOST OF IT IS JUST FROM THE 
WIND AND SOME OF THESE TREES 
SNAPPING CLEAN IN HALF. 
EARLIER BEFORE I WAS CUT OFF, 
YOU GUYS ASKED ME ABOUT THE 
POWER WHERE I WAS. 
THERE WAS NO POWER. 
JUST LOOKING DOWN, I DON'T SEE 
ANY STREET LIGHTS FOR ABOUT A 
BLOCK OR SO. 
AND I'M SURE IF I TRAVEL EVEN 
FURTHER, THAT WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE THE CASE. 
NO POWER IN THIS AREA. 
HEARD A LOT OF TRANSFORMERS 
BLOW THE LAST HOUR, THE HOUR-
AND-A-HALF OR SO. 
SO AS PEOPLE ARE WORKING TO SEE 
WHEN THEY GET THEIR POWER BACK 
ON, THEY ARE STARTING TO SEE 
THIS DAMAGE AS IT IS HAPPENING 
AND WHAT YOU SEE BEHIND ME, 
THIS IS JUST A LITTLE PIECE OF 
WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. 
IN TALLAHASSEE. 
>> ALICIA, YOU STAY SAFE OUT 
THERE FOR SURE, IT'S A LITTLE 
PRECARIOUS TO BE OUT THERE. 
>> PLEASE BE SAFE OUT THERE AS 
YOU SHARE THESE IMAGES FROM 
ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY. 
>> WE WANT TO SHOW YOU DAMAGE 
VIDEO. 
OH, THERE GOES A TREE. 
THAT SHOWS IT RIGHT THERE, THAT 
TREE LOOKS LIKE IT WAS ALREADY 
SPLIT. 
AND THEN IT FELL. 
AND PULLED UP BY THE ROOTS. 
THIS IS FROM EAST POINT. 
>> OH MY GOODNESS. 
>> WE HAD SOME TALLAHASSEE 
DAMAGE VIDEO AS WELL. 
>> THAT WITH SENT TO US FROM 
GREG GILBERT. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SENDING 
THAT AND I'M SO THANKFUL THE 
TREE FELL IN THE OPPOSITE 
DIRECTION. 
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT 
HAPPENED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU 
AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR 
HOME. 
>> I SAW THAT COMMENT FROM 
SOMEONE ELSE. 
THEY HAD VIDEO OF A PINE TREE 
THAT HAD FALLEN AND THEY SAID 
THANKFUL IT FELL AWAY FROM THE 
HOUSE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> SOME WILL BE LUCKY HERE. 
THAT'S THE CASE. 
OTHERS AS WE'VE SEEN, THE 
TREE'S GOING TO FALL RIGHT ON 
THE HOUSE. 
RIGHT ON THE CAR. 
AS WE SAW SO MANY TIMES DURING 
HERMINE AS WELL. 
>> I THINK THIS STORM IS OVER, 
THE DAMAGE WILL BE EXTENSIVE. 
>> WE WILL TALK ABOUT MICHAEL 
FOR A LONG TIME. 
LET'S CHECK IN WITH MARIEL. 
WHAT'S NEW? 
>> Reporter: WELL, THERE IS 
SOME DISCUSSION GOING ON RIGHT 
NOW ABOUT POSSIBLY GETTING THE 
FORCED RESPONDERS BACK ON THE 
ROAD. 
IT'S NOT CONFIRMED YET. 
BUT SOMETHING THEY'RE 
DISCUSSING AS THE WINDS HAVE 
BEEN A LITTLE LOWER. 
THE WINDS NED TO DIE DOWN A 
LITTLE MORE BEFORE THE UTILITY 
CREWS HEAD OUT. 
THE RESPONDERS WOULD BE CALLED 
BACK IN. 
>>> AND HILLARY LANE JOINS US 
NOW FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH, 
FLORIDA. 
HILLARY, YOU HAVE BEEN THERE IN 
PANAMA CITY BEACH REPORTING ON 
THIS STORM SINCE MONDAY IF 
THAT'S CORRECT. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU 
EXPERIENCED SINCE THEN? 
>> Reporter: IT WAS VERY 
INTERESTING. 
WHEN WE FIRST GOT TO PANAMA 
CITY BEACH MONDAY, IT WAS 
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. 
SAME WITH YESTERDAY. 
LITERALLY THE CALM BEFORE IF 
STORM. 
IT COULD NOT BE A MORE PERFECT 
DAY. 
SUNNY SKIES. 
THE WATER WAS BEAUTIFUL. 
AND, THINGS WERE STILL PRETTY 
NICE OVERNIGHT. 
BUT, ABOUT 8:00 A.M., EARLIER 
THIS MORNING IS WHEN THINGS 
RIGHT HERE IN THE AREA WHERE WE 
ARE REALLY STARTED TO CHANGE. 
AND THEY REALLY STARTED TO 
INTENSIFY. 
BETWEEN NOON AND 2:00 P.M. 
THAT'S WHEN WE GOT THE BRUNT OF 
THE STORM. 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETELY 
DIFFERENT AREA THAN THE 
BEAUTIFUL SUNNY BEACH WE SAW 
YESTERDAY. 
>> WHAT IS IT LIKE NOW? 
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING'S A 
BIT CALMER NOW. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>> Reporter: IT'S VERY, VERY 
CALM RIGHT NOW. 
ESPECIALLY COMPARATIVELY. 
BUT YOU COULD STILL GET A SENSE 
OF HOW MUCH DAMAGE WAS DONE TO 
THIS AREA. 
HOW SIGNIFICANT IT IS. 
YOU CAN SEE THE ROOF ON THIS 
CONVENIENCE STORE IS LIFTED UP. 
IT CONTINUES TO FLOW IN THE 
WIND. 
WE'RE EXPECTING THAT ROOF IF 
THE WIND PICKS UP AGAIN TO 
COMPLETELY FLY OFF. 
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BY NOW. 
AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU OVER 
HERE, OUR PHOTOGRAPHER GARY 
WILL PAN OVER. 
THIS STOP SIGN IS COMPLETELY 
TILTED OVER. 
AND UP ABOVE IT, THE GASOLINE 
SIGN. 
THE STOP SNAPPED BRANCHES, 
DOWNED TREES ALONG THE AREA AND 
ESPECIALLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS 
AS WELL IN THE LOWER LYING 
AREAS. 
SOME OF THOSE HOMES WERE 
COMPLETELY DEVASTATED OR 
COMPLETELY RUINED AND THE 
INTERESTING PART HERE IS THIS 
STORM WAS SO SEVERE. 
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA SAID 
LISTEN, OUR EMERGENCY PERSONNEL 
CANNOT GO OUT AND RESCUE YOU 
BECAUSE IT WOULD PUT THEIR 
LIVES IN DANGER. 
NOW EMERGENCY WORKERS ARE 
STARTING TO GET OUT AND SURVEY 
THE AREA AND GETTING A SENSE IF 
THERE WERE ANY INJURIES OR IF 
ANYONE PASSED AWAY IN THE 
STORM. 
>> SO YOU ARE SEEING THE 
ACTIVITY ON THE ROADS? 
THE FIRST RESPONDERS GETTING 
OUT AND HELPING PEOPLE? 
>> Reporter: YEAH, THIS IS THE 
FIRST TIME IT'S CALM ENOUGH FOR 
THEM TO GET OUT. 
WE ARE TOLD THEY ARE STARTING 
TO DO THAT. 
A BIG PART OF IT IS SURVEYING 
THE DAMAGE. 
ELECTRICITY IS A BEING ISSUE. 
A LOT OF THE ELECTRICITY IS 
OUT. 
AND WE'RE FURTHER INLAND SO WE 
CAN JUST IMAGINE HOW BAD IT 
MUST BE FOR THE COASTAL AREAS. 
UPWARDS OF 280,000 PEOPLE 
WITHOUT POWER. 
AND THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA 
SAID THE FIRST ISSUE, THE FIRST 
THING THEY HAVE TO DO IS GET 
THE POWER BACK ON. 
>> HILLARY, WE UNDERSTAND 
THERE'S ALMOST 260,000 PEOPLE 
WITHOUT POWER ACROSS FLORIDA. 
OVER A QUARTER OF A MILLION 
PEOPLE. 
HOW IS THAT AFFECTING THE FOLKS 
THERE WHERE YOU ARE? 
>> Reporter: I THINK THE MOST 
DIFFICULT PART ABOUT IT IS YOU 
CAN'T USE YOUR APPLIANCES AND 
IT'S VERY HOT. 
IN OUR HOTEL ROOM, THIS IS 
FLORIDA, IT'S OCTOBER, STILL 
EXTREMELY HOT. 
SO, FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY, 
FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED 
MEDICATIONS REFRIGERATED THIS 
COULD BE DEADLY FOR THESE 
PEOPLE. 
FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, BABIES, THE 
ELDERLY. 
>> WHAT ARE THE TEMPERATURES 
LIKE THERE NOW? 
IT'S OCTOBER SO I IMAGINE IT'S 
NOT AS HOT AS IT WAS JUST A 
MONTH AGO. 
>> Reporter: YEAH, IT'S NOT IN 
THE 80s  OR 90s . THANK GOD 
THIS ISN'T JULY OR AUGUST 
BECAUSE NOT HAVING ELECTRICITY 
WOULD BE TOUGHER BUT IT'S IN 
THE 70s . IT'S PRETTY WARM. 
ESPECIALLY IN OUR HOTEL ROOM. 
IT GETS HOT. 
IT GETS SOGGY. 
AND THEN ANOTHER ISSUE IS FOR 
PEOPLE LIVING IN AREAS CLOSER 
TO THE BEACH, THE WATER HAS 
FLOODED. 
WE SAW NIT OUR HOTEL. 
THE WATER SEEPS INTO THE CARPET 
AND MOLD CAN FORM. 
SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE. 
ESPECIALLY WITHOUT AIR-
CONDITIONING. 
THAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE LIKELY 
FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. 
>> HILLARY LANE, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING. 
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MUCH MORE 
CBSN. 
DON'T GO AWAY. 
>> I WANT TO TURN TO COVERAGE 
FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE 
FOR MORE ON HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
>> THINGS GOT REALLY, REALLY 
BAD OUT THERE. 
IT IS ACTUALLY CALM AT THE 
MOMENT. 
EXCEPT FOR THE WIND. 
THE WIND PICKS UP VERY STRONGLY 
NOT TOO LONG AGO. 
AND SO, THEY ASKED EVERYONE TO 
STAY INSIDE SO PEOPLE ARE NOT 
ABLE TO GO IN AND OUT AS THEY 
WERE BEFORE. 
SO, A BIT OF A CABIN FEVER. 
BUT, PEOPLE STILL GRATEFUL TO 
BE ABLE TO COME HERE AND HAVE A 
SAFE PLACE TO BE. 
WHILE ALL OF THIS GOES DOWN. 
MANY CHOOSING TO COME HERE 
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL SAFE 
IN THEIR HOME. 
AND MANY SAY IT'S BECAUSE OF 
THE TREES. 
A LOT OF THE FOLKS ARE FROM 
RIGHT IN THIS AREA. 
BUT THEY HAVE A LOT OF TREES IN 
THEIR YARDS AND THEY DIDN'T 
WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES SO 
THAT'S WHY THEY CAME HERE. 
BUT AGAIN, JUST MOMENTS AGO, 
THEY ARE ASKING EVERYONE TO 
STAY INSIDE BECAUSE OF THE 
CONDITIONS OF THE WEATHER 
OUTSIDE. 
AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO KEEP 
EVERYONE POSTED. 
BUT FOR NOW, BACK TO YOU IN THE 
STUDIO. 
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE THERE. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN SHELTER TO 
RIDE OUT THE STORM. 
WE ARE GETTING MORE PICTURES BY 
THE MOMENT. 
THE TALLAHASSEE FIRE DEPARTMENT 
REMINDS FOLKS THAT IF YOU STEP 
OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME CONSIDER 
EVERY DOWNED POWER LINE AS A 
LIVE WIRE. 
THEY SENT OUT THAT REMINDER. 
>> AND TEAMS FROM THE SHERIFF'S 
OFFICE SAID THAT IS THE BIG 
DANGER FOR THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPUTIES WHEN THEY HEAD OUT 
AFTER THE THREAT PASSES. 
THEY STILL HAVE THE WIRES DOWN 
EVERYWHERE. 
AND  THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH ONES 
ARE LIVE OR WHICH ONES ARE NOT. 
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE 
WIRES ARE SAFE. 
BEN CAPLIN HAS BEEN HOLDING 
DOWN THE FORT IN WAUCALA 
COUNTY. 
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S LESS RAIN ON 
YOUR LENS, THAT'S LOOKING 
IMPROVED. 
>> Reporter: WE'RE LOOKING AT 
GLASS HALF FULL. 
LESS WATER ON THE LENS. 
A LITTLE WIND. 
WE'RE AT A PARK RIGHT OFF HERE. 
IN THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN. 
WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH SOME OF 
WHAT WE'RE SEEING. 
THERE'S MORE TRAFFIC FLOWING 
THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN A LITTLE 
WHILE ON THE MAIN DRAG HERE. 
BUT LOOK AT THIS. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THE 
TREE JUST BENT IN HALF HERE. 
THAT'S THE DAMAGE WE'RE SEEING 
AT THE PARK. 
THE REASON WE PICKED THIS 
LOCATION, ONE, IS BECAUSE YES, 
THERE ARE TREES BUT I DON'T SEE 
ANY POWER LINES IN THE AREA. 
WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT THAT TOO. 
IT'S KIND OF A MICROCOSM OF 
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SINCE WE'VE 
BEEN HERE THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE 
HOURS. 
A LOT OF DEBRIS. 
TREE BRANCHES DOWN. 
YOU SEE IT RIGHT HERE. 
AND WE'RE MAKING OUR WAY TO 
WHAT LOOKS TO BE A JUNGLE GYM 
IN THIS PARK. 
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS 
STANDING AFTER WHAT CAME 
THROUGH THIS AREA. 
AND AGAIN, THE WINDS CONTINUING 
TO BLOW HERE. 
BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE. 
MY PHOTOGRAPHER RYAN KELLY 
POINTED THAT OUT. 
WHILE WE WERE WAITING FOR OUR 
LIVE SHOT. 
HE TOOK A WALK THROUGH THE PARK 
AND SPOTTED THAT. 
THAT'S THE JUNGLE GYM THERE. 
AND YOU SEE THE DEBRIS ON THE 
GROUND. 
A LOT LIKE SOME OF THE ROADS. 
I DO WANT TO SAY THIS THOUGH. 
I CAME LIVE TO YOU GUYS MAYBE 
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO FROM AZALEA 
DRIVE. 
AND WE NOTICED THAT TREE HAD 
BEEN CLEARED OFF THE ROAD. 
THEY ARE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB 
HERE JUST MAKING SURE ALL THE 
BIG DEBRIS AS MUCH AS THEY 
POSSIBLY CAN IS OUT OF THE WAY. 
IT'S AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR 
PEOPLE ONCE THEY ARE ABLE TO GO 
BACK OUTSIDE. 
DO NOT GO OUTSIDE. 
THEY ARE DOING THE BEST THEY 
CAN TO MAKE CONDITIONS SAFE. 
BACK TO YOU. 
>> AND WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING 
TO OUR TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE 
WTCE ON HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
WE'RE TAKING A QUICK BREAK. 
WE'LL BE BACK WITH MUCH MORE. 
STAY WITH US. 
>> LET'S TURN BACK NOW TO 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTING 
METEOROLOGIST JEFF IS HERE. 
JEFF, WE WERE TALKING EARLIER. 
YOU HAVE FAMILY DOWN IN PANAMA 
CITY. 
YOU SPOKE WITH THEM. 
WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU ABOUT 
CONDITIONS THERE? 
>> MY COUSIN'S INLAWS ARE NEAR 
A SHELTER, A SCHOOL, AND THE 
ROOF HAS BLOWN OFF. 
THE RAIN IS FLOODING IN. 
EVEN SOME OF THE BETTER MADE 
STRUCTURES ARE FAILING AS THIS 
STORM MOVING ON SHORE. 
>> SHOULDN'T WE ASSUME A SCHOOL 
IS BUILT CAT 3 STANDARDS? 
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR SCHOOL. 
AGAIN, WE TALKED ABOUT IT. 
AFTER 1992, FLORIDA STARTED TO 
MAKE THE BUILDING CODE A LITTLE 
MORE STRINGENT. 
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL 2001 OR 
2002 WHERE THEY MADE IT 
MANDATORY FOR STRUCTURES TO BE 
BUILT TO WITHSTAND A CAT 3. BUT 
EVEN THAT STRUCTURE MAY NOT 
WITHSTAND A CAT 4 OR 5. 
>> HOW FAR INLAND WAS THIS? 
>> 20 MILES INLAND. 
IT GIVES YOU AN IDEA. 
IF A SCHOOL ROOF HAS BLOWN OFF 
AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING SHELTER 
THERE, IT DIDN'T TURN OUT TO BE 
A GREAT SHELTER. 
>> I HOPE THEY'RE OKAY. 
>> I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE FINE. 
MY FAMILY HAS TALKED TO THEM. 
THOSE ARE PROBABLY THE LUCKY 
PEOPLE. 
THEY STAYED IN MOBILE HOMES. 
THEY STAYED IN STRUCTURES BUILT 
BEFORE 1992 OR 2002. 
>> SO HAS THE STORM REDUCED ITS 
INTENSE AT ALL? 
>> WINDS ARE DOWN TO 140 MILES 
AN HOUR. 
IT IS CROSSING THE GEORGIA 
FLORIDA LINE. 
BECAUSE IT WAS STRENGTHENING 
WHEN IT MADE LANDFALL, IT WILL 
WEAKEN A LITTLE LESS RAPIDLY 
AND CARRY THE HURRICANE FORCE 
WINDS AND DAMAGING WINDS 
STRAIGHT THROUGH GEORGIA. 
THERE WILL BE A SWATH OF 
DAMAGE, PROBABLY CAT 2 OR CAT 3 
DAMAGE IN PARTS OF SOUTHERN 
GEORGIA. 
WE SAW IT WITH CHARLIE. 
WE SAW IT WITH THIS STORM. 
THE COMMON DENOMINATOR THEY 
WERE STRENGTHENING STORMS AT 
LANDFALL. 
THEY HAVE TO PLATEAU. 
THEN THEY BEGIN TO WEAKEN. 
>> WHAT ABOUT RAINFALL? 
DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATES ON THAT? 
>> WELL, THE RAIN AT MAX, 
BECAUSE THE STORM IS MOVING 
FAST WILL BE ABOUT A FOOT, GIVE 
OR TAKE A LITTLE MORE THAN 
THAT. 
THAT'S OKAY IN NORTH FLORIDA. 
BUT IT WILL CAUSE FLASH 
FLOODING IN GEORGIA. 
AND THEN, ONCE IT GETS INTO 
PLACES LIKE SOUTH AND NORTH 
CAROLINA WHERE WE STILL HAVE 
SATURATED GROUND, SWOLLEN 
RIVERS, WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE 
ANOTHER ROUND OF SUBSTANTIAL 
FLOODING THERE. 
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN LATER 
TONIGHT. 
STARTING  LATER TONIGHT. 
THE HEAVIER STUFF MOVING IN. 
TOMORROW IS WHEN THE TROPICAL 
STORM MOVES ACROSS. 
THERE IS A CHANCE OF TORNADOES 
AS WELL. 
>> WE TALKED ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF TORNADOES. 
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN REGARDS 
TO THAT? 
ANY INDICATION? 
>> SURE, EVERY LANDFALLING 
TROPICAL SYSTEM PRODUCES 
TORNADOES. 
SOME PRODUCE A LOT. 
SOME PRODUCE LESS. 
EITHER WAY, THERE WILL BE FAST 
MOVING RAIN WRAPPED TORNADOES. 
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM AND IT IS 
VERY HARD TO PREPARE FOR THEM. 
WHEN WE SEE THEM AS 
METEOROLOGISTS THEY'RE MOVING 
60, 70, 80 MILES AN HOUR. 
WHEN WE SEE THEM, WE MAY GIVE 
YOU A COUPLE OF MINUTES LEAD 
TIME. 
BUT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE 
THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE WRAPPED IN 
RAIN. 
IT'S JUST A DIFFICULT 
SITUATION. 
BUT AGAIN, THE SYSTEM IS GOING 
TO BE WEAKENING TONIGHT. 
AND I THINK BY TOMORROW MORNING 
IT SHOULD BE AROUND TROPICAL 
STORM STATUS. 
>> SO WHAT'S 2 BIGGEST DANGER? 
>> WIND DAMAGE. 
AND THEN THE FOCUS WILL TURN TO 
FRESH WATER RAIN FLOODING 
DAMAGE STARTING TOMORROW AND 
INTO FRIDAY MORNING, THE STORM 
WILL BE MOVING OFFSHORE FRIDAY 
MORNING. 
IT'S NOT MOVING AT THE PACE 
FLORENCE DID. 
MUCH SLOWER. 
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING IN 
AUGUST. 
PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT POWER 
THREE WEEKS OR SO. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY WON'T 
NEED THEIR AIR-CONDITIONING 
QUITE AS MUCH AS THEY WOULD IN 
AUGUST, THIS WILL BE BETTER FOR 
THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW, RELY 
ON AIR-CONDITIONING AND 
ELECTRICITY. 
BUT STILL, IT WON'T BE EASY. 
>> THAT'S HELPFUL FOR THE 
ELDERLY. 
SO MANY WHO PERISH WHEN THERE'S 
NO AIR-CONDITIONING IN MID 
AUGUST. 
>> WE SAW WITH HURRICANE MARIA, 
IT WASN'T SO MUCH THE DAY OF 
THE STORM PEOPLE DIED BUT THE 
AFTERMATH GETTING SUPPLIES TO 
PEOPLE. 
PEOPLE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY OR 
THE ESSENTIALS TO GET THEM 
THROUGH. 
AND SO, WE SAW A LOT OF DEATHS 
AFTER THE DAY MARIA HIT. 
>> YOU MENTIONED THE FRESH 
WATER SURGE. 
IS THAT MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE 
OCEAN SURGE THAT WILL GO BACK 
OUT? 
>> THEY ARE BOTH SOMEWHAT 
EQUALLY DANGEROUS. 
THE SURGE WILL GO BACK OUT. 
AS WE SAW WITH FLORENCE, THE 
FRESH WATER FLOODING CAN LINGER 
FOR DAYS AND DAYS. 
THE LAST THING THEY NEEDED WAS 
THE FLOODING FROM HEAVY RAIN 
BUT THEY'LL GET IT AGAIN. 
>> JEFF, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
THAT UPDATE. 
WE'LL TAKE A QUICK BREAK AND BE 
RIGHT BACK WITH MUCH MORE CBSN. 
STAY WITH US. 
>> FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE. 
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY. 
>> AT 12:00 NOON, HIGH TIDE 
ROLLED IN. 
>> YOU CAN'T TELL THE RIVERS 
FROM THE ROADS. 
>> THIS WAS A MASSIVE OAK TREE. 
>> FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES 
THEY ARE HOPING THEY WILL STILL 
HAVE HOMES TO RETURN INTO. 
>>> HELLO EVERYONE, I'M TANYA 
RIVERO. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL IS NOW ONE OF 
THE MOST POWERFUL STORMS TO HIT 
THE U.S. MAINLAND. 
THE STORM MADE LANDFALL AS A 
CATEGORY 4 HITTING THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE NEAR MEXICO BEACH, 
THE HURRICANE IS NOW A CATEGORY 
3 BUT IS STILL PACKING QUITE A 
PUNCH. 
MORE THAN 257,000 PEOPLE ARE 
WITHOUT POWER. 
CBS NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER DAVID 
PARKINSON JOINS US NOW. 
SO DOWN TO A CATEGORY 3, BUT 
STILL A VERY, VERY POWERFUL 
STORM. 
IS THE WORST OF IT OVER? 
>> TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. 
I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE IN ANY 
OF THE PLACES WHERE THE STORM 
MADE LANDFALL, THE CONDITIONS 
WILL BE GETTING GRADUALLY 
BETTER. 
THE RAIN WILL STOP IN PANAMA 
CITY THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 
THE WIND IS IN THE 30#S# . I 
WANT TO CAUTION PEOPLE DON'T 
THINK JUST BECAUSE THE WORST OF 
THE STORM IS PASSED THAT YOU 
SHOULD GO OUTSIDE, THERE WILL 
BE A LOT OF DOWNED POWER LINES, 
LOTS OF DEBRIS. 
IT WILL BE QUITE DANGEROUS. 
THAT'S ASSUMING YOU DIDN'T 
EVACUATE WHICH AGAIN, YOU 
SHOULD HAVE EVACUATED. 
>> IS A CATEGORY 3 STILL STRONG 
ENOUGH TO LAUNCH TREES AND 
OTHER ITEMS INTO THE IR AND 
MAKE THEM DEADLY PROJECTILES? 
>> OH IT IS. 
TREES COME DOWN IN 50, 60 MILES 
AN HOUR WINDS. 
YOU HAVE DOUBLE THAT AT LEAST 
RIGHT NOW. 
IN A VERY SMALL AREA. 
IN TALLAHASSEE, WE THOUGHT THEY 
MIGHT GET HIT BY THE EYE WALL. 
THEY WILL DODGE THAT BULLET BY 
ABOUT 20 MILES SO IT'S A VERY 
CONFINED AREA. 
IF YOU ARE IN THE AREA OF THE 
CENTER OF THAT STORM, THAT'S 
WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE MOST WIND. 
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS 
THOUGH THE STORM SURGES ARE 
GOING DOWN, WE'RE APPROACHING A 
HIGH TIDE CYCLE. 
YOU HAVE TO CONTEND WITH STORM 
SURGE AND THINGS REALLY DO 
START IMPROVING. 
YOU'LL SEE BLUE SKY TOMORROW 
FOR SURE. 
>> HAVE YOU SEEN THE LATEST 
RADAR IMAGES? 
IS THE EYE PRETTY INTACT? 
>> IT'S DEFINITELY GETTING LESS 
INTACT. 
BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE THAT 
THE STORM IS HOLDING TOGETHER 
ITS FIGURE. 
YOU CAN SEE. 
>> THAT'S A PRETTY CLEAR EYE. 
>> AND ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF 
THE STORM, THE STORM LOOKS TO 
BE A LITTLE BIT STRONGER IN 
TERMS OF ITS RAIN BANDS. 
WHEN YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT THE 
STRONGEST WINDS USUALLY ON THE 
RIGHT SIDE OF THE STORM BECAUSE 
YOU GET TO ADD THE FORWARD 
PROGRESS OF THE STORM WHICH IS 
MOVING AT 15 MILES AN HOUR PLUS 
THE WIND. 
YOU CAN SEE THAT IS A CLOSE 
ZOOMED IN RADAR. 
AND RIGHT ON THE LINE OF 
GEORGIA AND ALABAMA IS WHERE 
THE HEAVIEST BANDS ARE NOW. 
ANOTHER THING TO NOTE, THERE 
WILL BE PLENTY OF TORNADO 
WARNINGS. 
WE HAVE SEEN THEM NEAR 
JACKSONVILLE, NEAR MACON 
GEORGIA. 
THERE'S A TAIL ON THE STORM. 
THE CHANCE FOR POWER OUTAGES 
ALL THE WAY UP TOWARD ATLANTA. 
THEN ALL THE WAY INTO THE 
CAROLINAS AS WELL. 
>> DOES THE TAIL BRING WIND? 
>> SO, THAT LITTLE TAIL OF 
SEVERE STORMS ESSENTIALLY WHAT 
HAPPENS IS YOU HAVE WIND MOVING 
AT DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. 
YOU HAVE ROTATION IN THE 
ATMOSPHERE BRINGING ABOUT 
TORNADOES. 
ON TOP OF THAT, YOU HAVE STRONG 
STRAIGHT LINE WINDS SO IT'S A 
BAD COMBINATION OF THE TWO. 
THEY DON'T LAST VERY LONG 
NECESSARILY. 
BUT THEY CAN CERTAINLY CAUSE 
PLENTY OF DAMAGE OR BE DEADLY. 
SO WHEN EVER YOU'RE UNDER A 
TORNADO WATCH WHICH THEY ARE 
UNTIL 2:00 A.M., YOU NEED TO 
TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. 
THE RAIN, WE'VE SEEN HALF A 
FOOT OF RAIN WHERE THE STORM 
MADE LANDFALL. 
WE WILL SEE LESS RAIN BUT IT IS 
HAPPENING SO QUICKLY THAT IT'S 
A FLASH FLOOD CONCERN. 
>> FLORENCE MOVED SO SLOWLY. 
MICHAEL SEEMS TO BE SPEEDING 
ALONG COMPARED TO FLORENCE. 
>> MICHAEL FEELS LIKE A NORMAL 
HURRICANE SHOULD. 
RIGHT? 
WHICH IS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE 
ANY SORT OF ATMOSPHERIC 
BLOCKING OR SOMETHING GUMMING 
UP THE WORKS OF FORWARD 
PROGRESS, THIS IS AROUND THE 
SPEED THAT YOU WOULD GET. 
10 TO 20 MILES AN HOUR RANGE. 
>> SO IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FAST?  
>>> RIGHT NOW, FLORIDA GOVERNOR 
RICK SCOTT AND OTHER OFFICIALS 
ARE GIVING AN UPDATE ON 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
>> A EMERGENCY DECLARATION TO 
ALLOW RESOURCES TO FLOW INTO 
THE IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. 
I SPOKE WITH THE PRESIDENT AND 
HE IS COMMITTED TO MAKING EVERY 
FEDERAL RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO 
HELP THE RECOVERY. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL IS THE WORST 
STORM THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE HAS 
EVER SEEN AND ONE OF THE WORST 
POWERED STORMS TO MAKE LANDFALL 
IN THE UNITED STATES. 
WE HEARD OF SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS 
AT TINDEL AIR FORCE BASE AND 
MANY COMMUNITIES ALONG THE 
COAST. 
AS HURRICANE MICHAEL CONTINUES 
ITS DESTRUCTIVE PATH THROUGH 
THE PANHANDLE AND LEAVES OUR 
STATE, WE ARE TURNING 100% OF 
OUR FOCUS ON SEARCH AND RESCUE 
AND RECOVERY. 
BUT, WE NEED EVERY FAMILY TO 
HELP WITH THIS. 
LISTEN TO LOCAL OFFICIALS. 
WE COULD STILL HAVE FLASH 
FLOODING AND TORNADOES. 
WE HEARD OF TWO DEVASTATING 
TORNADOES IN GASTON COUNTY. 
THE WEATHER IS STILL EXTREMELY 
DANGEROUS. 
DO NOT TAKE A RISK. 
BE SAFE. 
WE ALSO NEED PEOPLE TO BE VERY 
SAFE WITH GENERATORS. 
DO NOT PUT A RUNNING GENERATOR 
IN YOUR HOME. 
IT IS NOT SAFE. 
DO NOT GET OUT ON THE ROADS 
UNTIL YOU'RE TOLD IT IS SAFE. 
WE NEED THE ROAD TO BE OPEN FOR 
FIRST RESPONDERS, AND SEARCH 
AND RESCUE TO DO THEIR JOBS. 
AND SAVE LIVES. 
IF IT IS NOT SAFE TO LEAVE YOUR 
HOUSE, DON'T LEAVE IT. 
IF YOU AND YOUR FAMILY MADE IT 
THROUGH THE STORM SAFELY, THE 
WORST THING YOU CAN DO NOW IS 
TO ACT FOOLISHLY AND PUT 
YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY IN 
DANGER OR KEEP LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AND RESCUE WORKERS FROM SAVING 
LIVES. 
OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT ARE HEROS LEAVING 
THEIR FAMILY TO HELP OTHERS. 
WE CANNOT THANK THEM ENOUGH. 
AS I SAID EARLIER TODAY, WE ARE 
DEPLOYING A MASSIVE WAVE OF 
RESPONSE. 
WE'LL BE SENDING AIR FROM AIR, 
LAND, AND SEA. 
THIS INCLUDES THOUSANDS OF 
RESPONDERS FOR POWER 
RESTORATION. 
MEDICAL SEARCH AND RESCUE. 
LAW ENFORCEMENT, FOOD AND WATER 
DISTRIBUTION. 
AND EVERY OTHER CRITICAL 
RESOURCE. 
I WAS BRIEFED BY THE COAST 
GUARD AND THEY HAVE CRITICAL 
ASSETS AND RESOURCES IN TAMPA 
AND MOBILE. 
ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF RESCUE 
WORKERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS 
1800 PERSONNEL READY TO DEPLOY 
LOCALLY. 
RIGHT NOW, UTILITIES ARE 
REPORTING MORE THAN 192,000 
HOMES AND BUSINESSES WITHOUT 
POWER. 
WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATED NUMBER 
OUT TO YOU THROUGHOUT THE 
NIGHT. 
SO, LET'S ALL STAY SAFE. 
STAY ALERT TO WEATHER UPDATES 
AND WATCH THIS STORM CLOSELY 
THROUGH THE NIGHT. 
THE ENTIRE NATION AND WORLD 
HAVE WATCHED THIS MONSTER STORM 
AS IT DEVASTATED OUR GULF COAST 
AND PANHANDLE. 
THE LOVE AND SUPPORT WE HAVE 
RECEIVED FROM SO MANY IS 
OVERWHELMING AND WE ARE 
APPRECIATIVE OF ALL THE 
RESOURCES AND PRAYERS THAT HAVE 
BEEN OFFERED. 
ON BEHALF OF THE GULF COAST, I 
WANT TO THANK THE NATION FOR 
YOUR PRAYERS. 
FOLLOWING THE STORM, WE MUST 
ALL COME TOGETHER AND WORK 
TOGETHER. 
FLORIDIANS TAKE CARE OF EACH 
OTHER. 
WE SAW IT AFTER HERMINE, 
MATTHEW, ANDREW, AN IRMA. 
FLORIDA IS UNBREAKABLE AND 
WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS 
TOGETHER. 
HURRICANE MICHAEL COULD NOT 
BREAK FLORIDA.

 THREE 
QUESTIONS. 
>> HAVE YOU HEARD ANY REPORTS 
OF ANY FATALITIES AT THIS 
POINT? 
>> WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONFIRMED 
REPORTS OF FATALITIES RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> AND WHAT'S THE EARLIEST THAT 
SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS WILL BE 
HEADED OUT TO THE FIELD? 
>> WE ARE SENDING THEM OUT. 
THEY STARTED OUT ALREADY. 
SO, WE'LL HAVE, YOU KNOW, I 
THINK WE TALKED ABOUT IT 
EARLIER. 
WE HAVE SEARCH AND RESCUE 
COMING FROM THE NORTH DOWN 
TOWARD THE COAST. 
AND WE HAVE THE COAST GUARD 
COMING FROM THE TAMPA AREA. 
I THINK THEY'RE IN CLEAR WATER. 
AND, FROM ALABAMA. 
AND, THEY WILL BE DOING OUR 
COAST. 
>> AND SO, IS THERE A SPECIFIC 
AREA THAT THEY ARE 
CONCENTRATING ON RIGHT AWAY 
FIRST OFF? 
>> WE HAVE TEAMS. 
WE HAVE BROKEN IT UP INTO 
REGIONS. 
WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT REGIONS. 
IT WILL BE COMING DOWN SO THEY 
WILL MEET UP. 
WE'RE CLEARLY GETTING 
INFORMATION WHERE THERE'S 
PROBLEMS. 
BIG COUNTIES HAVE SIGNIFICANT 
PROBLEMS. 
WE'RE DEALING WITH THEM AS 
QUICKLY AS WE CAN. 
WE HAVE ALREADY SENT TEAMS 
ALREADY STARTING. 
>> THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT 
LOCAL READINESS BASED ON YOU 
TEAM. 
DO YOU ANY THEY WERE PREPARED 
FOR THE STORM? 
>> YOU KNOW, IT CAME REALLY 
FAST. 
EVERYBODY DIDN'T EVACUATE. 
I'M STILL PRAYING WE DIDN'T 
LOSE EVERYBODY THAT WAS 
DISAPPOINTING TO ME THAT 
EVERYBODY DIDN'T EVACUATE. 
YOU KNOW, I THINK IN EVERY 
STORM, YOU HAVE TO ASSESS AFTER 
YOU GET FINISHED. 
I THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD DO IT 
LOCALLY, FEDERAL, AND STATE. 
WE'LL SEE OVER TIME IF PEOPLE 
WERE READY. 
THIS WAS A BIG STORM. 
YOU HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THE 
VIDEOS THAT ARE OUT THERE. 
THIS WAS A BIG STORM. 
AND, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE 
IN SOME PLACES. 
WE'LL FIND OUT OVER TIME. 
>> WE'LL TAKE ONE MORE 
QUESTION. 
GOVERNOR, THERE ARE SEVERAL 
PRISON AND DETENTION FACILITIES 
IN THIS AREA. 
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM THOSE 
FACILITIES? 
WHAT'S THEIR STATUS NOW THAT 
THIS IS STARTING TO CLEAR OUT? 
>> SURE, WE'VE HEARD SOME 
DIFFERENT CORRECTIONS AND 
PRISON FACILITIES AND WE'RE 
FOLLOWING UP TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE EVERYBODY IS SAFE. 
>> THOSE FACILITIES ARE STILL 
INTACT AND THERE'S BEEN NO 
ISSUE? 
>> I CAN GIVE YOU ...  
WE HAVE SOME DAMAGE AT SOME 
FACILITIES. 
WHAT I'VE BEEN TOLD SO FAR HAS 
BEEN SOME ROOF DAMAGE. 
SO WE'RE SENDING TEAMS TO MAKE 
SURE EVERYBODY IS SAFE. 
>> THE INMATES ARE SECURED? 
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING 
THAT THEY'RE NOT. 
I HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS SOME 
DAMAGE IN SOME ROOFS. 
AS YOU CAN EXPECT, THERE'S A 
LOT. 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE PATH, 
THERE'S A LOT OF ROOF DAMAGE IN 
THAT PATH. 
SO, THE BIG THING NOW IS WE'RE 
GETTING FEEDBACK. 
WHERE WE HAVE PROBLEMS, WE'RE 
SENDING SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS 
RIGHT AWAY. 
PEOPLE ARE VERY AGGRESSIVELY 
GETTING OUT THERE TO ASSESS THE 
DAMAGE AND PROVIDE ANY 
RESOURCES ANYBODY NEEDS. 
>> THANKS GUYS. 
>> THANKS EVERYBODY. 
>>> WE JUST HEARD FLORIDA 
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT GIVING US 
AN UPDATE ON THE IMPACT OF 
HURRICANE MICHAEL THERE. 
HE SAID 100% OF THE FOCUS IS 
NOW ON SEARCH AND RESCUE. 
HE DID WARN PEOPLE THERE TO 
REMAIN SHELTERED IN PLACE. 
HE SAYS FLASH FLOODING AND 
TORNADOES ARE STILL A DANGER TO 
THE REGION. 
THERE ARE NO CONFIRMED REPORTS 
OF FATALITIES AT THIS POINT 
ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR. 
WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO COVERAGE 
FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE AFFILIATE, 
WCTV FOR MORE. 
>> ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT 
MY HAIRCUT IS I DON'T 
NECESSARILY NEED A HOOD. 
I DID NEED THE RAIN GEAR, WE 
ARE IN A BREAK FROM THE RAKE. 
WE'RE IN AZALEA PARK. 
EARLIER, WE SHOWED YOU THIS 
JUNGLE GYM STRUCTURE THAT 
LOOKED BLOWN OVER. 
WE DID SOME FURTHER INSPECTION. 
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS JUST 
CONSTRUCTED THAT WAY. 
I PULLED SEVERAL MUSCLES JUST 
LOOKING  AT IT BUT I DON'T WANT 
TO MISLEAD ANYBODY OUT THERE. 
YOU CAN SEE THE DAMAGE IN 
AZALEA PARK. 
YOU SEE A LAW ENFORCEMENT 
VEHICLE ACROSS THE STREET. 
THIS TREE RIGHT HERE, TOPPLED, 
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. 
THERE ARE THE ROOTS. 
THERE'S THE TRUNK. 
IT'S NOT A BIG TREE. 
BY ANY MEANS. 
BUT YOU'RE SEEING SOME OF THE 
DAMAGE, SOME OF THE DEBRIS THEY 
ARE EXPERIENCING HERE. 
WE'LL TAKE YOU THROUGH A WALK 
IN THIS PARK. 
A LITTLE BIT EARLIER. 
RIGHT OFF THE ROAD, YOU SEE 
BRANCHES. 
YOU SEE MORE DEBRIS ON THE 
GROUND. 
THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE 
BEEN SEEING. 
WE HAVE BEEN GOING IN AND OUT 
TRYING TO STAY SAFE. 
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BREAK OUR 
OWN RULES, JUST TRYING TO GIVE 
PEOPLE AN IDEA OF WHAT THIS 
STORM HAS CAUSED HERE. 
AT ABOUT 1:00 I WANT TO SAY, WE 
WERE IN PANACEA. 
WE WERE AT MAD ANTHONY'S AND WE 
SAW THE WATER COMING UP. 
THE STORM SURGE WAS TO THE 
POINT WHERE THE SHERIFF 
DEPUTIES SAID THAT WE NEEDED TO 
LEAVE THAT AREA BECAUSE THEY 
WERE WORRIED THE WATER WAS 
GOING TO GO ACROSS THE HIGHWAY. 
THE GOAL IS TO MOVE DOWN THAT 
WAY. 
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SAFER TO DO 
SO. 
SO RIGHT NOW ON CRAWFORDVILLE, 
YOU HAVE SEEN THE DAMAGE. 
A LOT OF LIMBS DOWN. 
WE HAVE SEEN SOME BIGGER TREES 
DOWN. 
BUT WE'RE NOW GOING TO TRY TO 
MAKE OUR WAY TOWARD THE COAST 
TO BRING YOU A BETTER PICTURE 
OF WHAT'S GOING ON. 
STAY SAFE. 
THERE'S MORE TRAFFIC ON THE 
ROADS. 
DO NOT BE OUT ON THE ROADS. 
IF YOU'RE ABLE TO STAY INSIDE, 
HUNKER DOWN, DO SO. 
THAT'S WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS 
TELLING EVERYONE TO DO. 
AS LONG AS THE STORM CONTINUE 
TO BE A THREAT, YOU WANT TO 
MAKE SURE YOU'RE DOING THE BEST 
YOU CAN TO STAY SAFE. 
WE'LL DO THE SAME THING. 
BUT IF WE'RE ABLE TO GET CLOSER 
TO THE COASTLINE, WE'LL DO SO. 
BEN CAPLIN. 
EYEWITNESS NEWS. 
>> THANKS BEN. 
BE SAFE. 
AND WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU 
SOON. 
HOPEFULLY FROM ANOTHER LOCATION 
WITH MORE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING 
DOWN BY THE COAST. 
>> AND WE'RE ANXIOUS TO SEE HOW 
OUR NEIGHBORS ARE DOING BY THE 
COAST. 
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT, THIS 
STORM IS FAR FROM OVER. 
IT'S RAINING, WINDY. 
A 60 MILES AN HOUR WIND GUST IN 
MARIANA. 
63 MILES AN HOUR WIND GUST IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
SO IT IS STILL VERY MUCH HERE 
AND VERY DANGEROUS. 
>> MOVING NORTH AND EAST 
THROUGH SOUTHWEST GEORGIA WHERE 
KEVIN KEENE HAS BEEN RIDING OUT 
THE STORM. 
HE FILES THIS REPORT. 
>> Reporter: HERE IN CAIRO, 
GEORGIA, THE EFFECTS OF 
HURRICANE MICHAEL FELT, SEEN, 
AND HEARD MORE NOW AS THE STORM 
CREEPS CLOSER AND CLOSER. 
THE MIDDLE OF THE STORM CREEPS 
CLOSER TO SOUTH GEORGIA. 
RIGHT NOW, THE WIND PICKING UP. 
IT IS RAINING IN SHEETS HEAVIER 
THAN IT WAS 30 TO 45 MINUTES 
AGO. 
YOU CAN HEAR SEVERAL TREES 
SNAPPING BEHIND ME. 
NOT EVEN A QUARTER MILE AWAY. 
JUST SNAPPING, LIMBS FALLING 
ONTO THE ROAD. 
FURTHER THAN WE FELT SAFE TO 
GO, A TREE FELL ON THE POWER 
LINES THAT CONNECT HERE TO THE 
WORSHIP CENTER THEY SPOKE TO 
THE POWER COMPANY NOT TOO LONG 
AGO. 
THEY DON'T EXPECT TO GET POWER 
RESTORED TO THIS FACILITY FOR 
AT LEAST ANOTHER 24 HOURS. 
THEY ARE URGING EVERYONE TO 
STAY SAFE IN SOUTH GEORGIA. 
EVERYWHERE. 
BUT THE STORM MAKING ITS WAY 
THIS WAY. 
CERTAINLY COST GETTING MORE 
POWERFUL BY THE MINUTE. 
WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER UPDATE FOR 
YOU IN JUST A BIT. 
>> KEVIN, THANK YOU. 
AS YOU SAID, IT'S NOT OVER YET. 
YOU KNOW? 
IT LOOKS CALM WHERE BEN IS BUT 
PICKING UP WHERE KEVIN IS 
ACROSS THE REGION, THINGS ARE 
DIFFERENT AND SHIFTING MINUTE 
TO MINUTE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
AND THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS 
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE REGION 
WITHOUT POWER. 
FOR THE LATEST ON THAT ...  
>>> YEAH, FROM THE PANHANDLE TO 
EAST OF THE TALLAHASSEE THROUGH 
SOUTH GEORGIA, MORE THAN 
160,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER. 
WE WILL START BY TALKING ABOUT 
THE LARGEST OUTAGE. 
DUKE ENERGY REPORTING MORE THAN 
32,000 CUSTOMER INS THE 
PANHANDLE HAVE LOST POWER. 
REPORTING MORE THAN 35,000 
CUSTOMERS WITHOUT. 
THE CITY OF TALLAHASSEE NOW HAS 
NEARLY 62,000 CUSTOMERS IN THE 
DARK. 
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT IS 
POSTED ON YOUR SCREEN. 
THAT'S HOW QUICKLY THESE 
NUMBERS ARE GOING UP. 
TRICOUNTY ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE 
HAS 4100 CUSTOMERS WITHOUT 
ELECTRICITY. 
THE SWANNEE VALLEY ELECTRIC HAS 
CUSTOMERS WITHOUT. 
THE ELECTRICSHIP CORPORATION 
HAS 1300 PEOPLE WITHOUT 
ELECTRICITY. 
AND GEORGIA POWER WITH 25,000 
PEOPLE. 
AS I MENTIONED THESE NUMBERS 
ARE CONSISTENTLY WATCHING. 
REPORTING LIVE IN THE NEWS 
ROOM, KATIE CAPLIN, WCTV 
EYEWITNESS NEWS. 
>> THANK YOU KATIE. 
IT'S JUST, BAD OUT THERE. 
>> 160,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT POWER 
AT THIS MOMENT. 
>> I BELIEVE THAT TOPS HERMINE. 
HERMINE WAS IN TALLAHASSEE. 
THAT NUMBER IS ONLY GOING TO 
RISE. 
CUSTOMERS, FAMILIES. 
>> WITHOUT POWER TONIGHT. 
>> A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAN 
160,000. 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
MARIEL, YOU HEARD THE NUMBERS. 
160,000 PEOPLE IN OUR AREA WHO 
HAVE NO POWER RIGHT NOW. 
>> Reporter: THAT'S RIGHT. 
THAT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
BUT THE CITY IS ANNOUNCING THEY 
ARE SENDING CREWS BACK OUT ON 
THE ROADS SO FIRST RESPONDERS, 
UTILITY CREWS, THEY WILL BE 
STARTING TO GO OUT, ASSESS SOME 
OF THE DAMAGE. 
AND, HOPEFULLY START RESPONDING 
TO SOME OF THE CALLS THAT HAVE 
BEEN COMING IN HERE. 
THE CITY IS STILL SAYING YOU 
SHOULDN'T BE GOING OUT. 
STILL STAY INSIDE YOUR HOME. 
STAY SHELTERED WHEREVER YOU'RE 
AT. 
AGAIN, THOSE CREWS, THEY DON'T 
REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY'LL RUN 
INTO ON THE ROADS. 
WE STILL HAVE ALL THE TREES. 
DOWN, MORE THAN 50 ROADS 
IMPACTED. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS, THEY WILL BE 
ABLE TO START MAKING SOME 
PROGRESS. 
NOW, IF THE WINDS PICK BACK UP, 
THEY WILL BE CALL BACK IN. 
FOR NOW, THEY WILL BE OUT 
THERE. 
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT JUST 
SAYING YES, THINGS LOOK A 
LITTLE CALMER. 
WE'RE SENDING PEOPLE OUT. 
IT'S NOT OVER YET. 
>> WE'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF 
THINGS. 
LOOKS LIKE THE MOST INTENSE 
PART HAS PASSED. 
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT TO GO 
THROUGH THIS. 
TAKE THAT, PLUS NIGHTFALL WILL 
BE UPON US SOON. 
WE DON'T WANT TO LET OUR GUARD 
DOWN. 
WE DON'T WANT TO GET OUT AFTER 
THE SUN HAS SET. 
>> Reporter: AND YOU HEARD HIM 
SAY RIGHT THERE, THEY DON'T 
WANT PEOPLE OUT THERE AFTER THE 
SUN GOES DOWN. 
WE'RE GETTING NEAR THAT TIME. 
AND JUST WITH THE STORM ITSELF, 
IT MAKES IT ALREADY DARK 
OUTSIDE. 
SO, AGAIN, STAY IN YOUR HOME. 
STAY IN THE SHELTER IF THAT'S 
WHERE YOU'RE AT. 
LET THE CREWS DO THEIR JOBS. 
AND, MORE OF THAT DAMAGE 
ASSESSMENT THAT WILL REALLY 
KICK INTO HIGH GEAR TOMORROW 
MORNING. 
AS CREWS ARE OUT THERE. 
ABLE TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT 
WHICH POWER LINES ARE DOWN. 
WHICH TREES ARE DOWN AND START 
TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP THE 
DEBRIS AND START CUTTING 
THROUGH IT AND MAKE SURE THE 
ROADWAYS ARE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO 
GET BACK ON THE ROAD SOME TIME. 
REPORTING LIVE FROM THE 
EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER, 
MARIEL CARBON. 
>> WOW. 
>> I WAS LOOKING THROUGH A LIST 
E-MAILED OUT EARLIER. 
IT GOES ON AND ON AND ON. 
FROM THE TREES DOWN. 
AND YOU KNOW, THAT WILL TAKE 
TIME. 
YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CREWS TO 
GET THEM QUICKLY. 
YOU CAN'T GET THEM ALL AT ONCE. 
PEOPLE SHOULD TRY TO STAY IN 
AND HAVE A LOT OF PATIENCE. 
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY, 
EVERYBODY'S ALLUDING TO THIS 
CABIN FEVER. 
THEY WANT TO GET OUT AN CHECK 
ON THEIR HOMES. 
NOT YET. 
BE PATIENT. 
ALL OF THIS GETS MORE 
COMPLICATED ONCE THE SUN GOES 
DOWN. 
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE, YOU CAN'T 
NECESSARILY SEE THE DOWNED TREE 
AHEAD. 
YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY SEE THE 
POWER LINE. 
JUST STAY PUT. 
RIDE OUT THE STORM. 
WE WILL DO THAT HERE ON THE 
AIR, WE'RE DOING THAT ON 
STREAMING, ON SOCIAL MEDIA. 
AND, WE APPRECIATE YOU STAYING 
WITH US THROUGHOUT THE STORM TO 
GET THE VERY BEST INFORMATION. 
>> AND YOU KNOW, CABIN FEVER IS 
A PROBLEM AND THEN THE POWER'S 
OUT. 
SO YOU CAN'T WATCH A MOVIE OR 
POP A DVD IN. 
PLAY VIDEO GAMES. 
WE'RE SO USED TO THESE THINGS. 
WE TAKE THEM FOR GRANTED SO 
WHEN THEY'RE GONE, IT GETS 
DIFFICULT. 
>> WELL, MIKE MCCALL HAS BEEN 
UPDATING US FOR DAYS ON 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY ROUGH 
DAY. 
WHAT'S AHEAD FOR US NOW? 
>> WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OVER THE 
HUMP. 
CONDITIONS ARE STARTING TO 
RAPIDLY IMPROVE. 
BUT WE'RE NOT DONE WITH IT YET. 
CERTAINLY THE WORST OF IT NOW 
IS GETTING WEAKER BUT IT'S 
STILL A STRONG SYSTEM MOVING 
THROUGH PARTS OF SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA. 
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE CENTER CAME 
ASHORE BETWEEN PANAMA CITY AND 
JUST TO THE NORTHWEST OF MEXICO 
BEACH. 
MOVED ON THROUGH CALHOUN COUNTY 
AND JACKSON COUNTY. 
AND SEMINOLE COUNTY. 
NOW MOVING THROUGH MILLER 
COUNTY. 
THAT'S THE CENTER. 
AS YOU CAN TELL, IT'S A LARGE 
SYSTEM. 
WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT 
IMPACTS, CREST VIEW, ALL THE 
WAY TO MONTICELLO. 
YOU HAVE HAD BREEZY CONDITIONS. 
BUT ASIDE FROM GUSTS IS REALLY 
AS EXPECTED THERE. 
LET'S LOOK A LITTLE MORE 
CLOSELY ON THE INFRARED 
SATELLITE VIEW. 
WATCH HOW THE EYE KIND OF FILLS 
IN. 
AND THE COLORIZED VERSION OF 
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. 
YOU CAN WATCH HOW THAT CENTER, 
SUCH A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE EYE 
WALL THAT WAS SURROUNDING THAT 
EYE. 
AND NOW, HOW THAT IS GETTING 
WEAKER AND WEAKER. 
THE HIGHER CLOUD TOPS, ARE 
COLDER. 
THAT'S THE WAY SATELLITE, THIS 
INFRARED SATELLITE WORKS. 
WHERE YOU SEE THE DEEP REDS, 
YOU HAVE THE INTENSE RAIN 
BANDS. 
ONE OF THOSE THOUGH IT IS NOW 
70 MILES FROM THE CENTER, IT 
STILL PRODUCED WIND GUSTS TO 60 
MILES AN HOUR THROUGH PARTS OF 
LEON COUNTY. 
THERE WILL STILL BE SOME OF 
THESE GUSTS AND THIS LITTLE 
BAND SLIDING OUT THROUGH 
JEFFERSON COUNTY. 
INTO MADISON COUNTY, THOMAS AND 
BROOKS COUNTY. 
IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU MUCH, BUT 
THAT POTENTIAL IS STILL THERE 
FOR ONE OF THE SQUALLS TO SHOVE 
SOME OF THE STRONGER WINDS DOWN 
TOWARD THE SURFACE THAT COULD 
EXCEED  60 MILES AN HOUR. 
THEY WILL STILL BE LIKELY 
HIGHER THAN THAT AT TIMES 
ESPECIALLY FROM MILLER COUNTY, 
UP INTO EARLY AND BAKER 
COUNTIES WHERE WE STILL HAVE 
THAT POTENTIAL. 
THE DRY AIR IS WORKING ITS WAY 
IN FROM THE WEST. 
I'LL SHOW YOU A RADAR VIEW IN A 
MOMENT. 
GOT THE RADAR IMAGES BACK IN. 
BUT CLEARLY, YOU CAN SEE THAT 
IT'S JUST A HUGE CHUNK OF 
TROPICAL MOISTURE. 
BUT WATCH THE FUTURECAST. 
BECAUSE, DOWN HERE IS 
TALLAHASSEE. 
UP HERE IS ALBANY. 
AND WATCH THE TIME WE GET TO 
JUST AFTER 11:00 TONIGHT, THE 
CENTER SHOULD BE EXITING THE 
NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA 
TAKING ALMOST ALL THE RAINFALL 
WITH IT. 
IT WILL STILL BE RAINING AT 
TIMES ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTH 
GEORGIA. 
NORTH OF 84. 
DOWN SOUTH OF THE STATE LINE 
THERE WILL BE SCATTERED 
LEFTOVER SHOWERS. 
CHECKING OUT THE FORECAST WIND 
SPEEDS, WE'RE NOT DONE. 
THOUGH SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE 
NOTHING MORE THAN A LIGHT 
BREEZE, WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT 
THE FUTURECAST. 
WINDS SHOWING 40 TO 50 MILES AN 
HOUR ESPECIALLY IN THE GUSTS. 
MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED THAT WAY. 
BUT CERTAINLY NEAR THAT CENTER. 
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WINDS OF 40 
TO 50. 
SOMETIMES 70 OR 75 MILES AN 
HOUR. 
ESPECIALLY WITHIN A FEW MILES 
OF THAT CENTER AS IT MOVES OFF 
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST. 
THEN, THE WIND CHANGES 
DIRECTION. 
THE CENTER IS OUT OF THE 
PICTURE OVERNIGHT. 
WE GET BACK TO A WEST WIND. 
BETTER CONDITIONS. 
THE SURGE, I THINK WE'RE DONE 
WITH THE WORST OF THIS NOW. 
WE CAN START TO HOPEFULLY SEE 
THE WATERS RECEDE. 
BUT, THE WIND IS STILL COMING 
IN ALONG FROM THE COAST. 
SO IT'S NOT GOING TO RECEDE 
QUICKLY. 
THE TIDE IS GOING OUT, SO 
THAT'S ENCOURAGING BUT THE 
STORM SURGE WARNING CONTINUES 
IN EFFECT FOR TAYLOR, 
JEFFERSON, AND FRANKLIN 
COUNTIES. 
THREE HOURS AGO WE HEARD 
REPORTS. 
VERY LIKELY THIS FORECAST OF 
EIGHT TO 12 FEET POSSIBLY IN A  
FEW SPOTS ESPECIALLY UP TOWARD 
SAINT MARK. 
HOPEFULLY EVERYONE MADE IT 
THROUGH OKAY. 
ONCE WE GET OFFICIAL WORD, 
WE'LL PASS IT ALONG. 
LET'S GET TO THE RADAR. 
WE HAVE THE RADAR BACK IN 
BUSINESS. 
YOU CAN SEE THE CENTER NOW, A 
LOT OF THINGS WE CAN LOOK AT 
HERE. 
FIRST THING YOU MAY NOTICE IS 
HOW THERE IS ALMOST NOTHING 
SOUTH OF I-10. 
ROUGHLY. 
STILL SOME STORMINESS. 
DOWN TO LIBERTY COUNTY. 
THE CORE OF THE STRONGEST 
WINDS, THAT'S MAINLY TO THE 
NORTH AND EAST OF THE CENTER. 
STILL MOVING THROUGH MITCHELL 
COUNTY. 
BAKER COUNTY. 
MOVING THROUGH MILLER COUNTY. 
SOME BANDS, WE HAVE NOT SEEN 
THE ROTATING THUNDERSTORMS THAT 
ARE USUALLY FREQUENT WITH SOME 
OF THESE STORMSAS THEY COME IN 
FROM WATER TOWARD LAND. 
BUT, THERE ARE STILL SOME 
SQUALLS OUT THERE. 
AGAIN, SOME OF THESE RIGHT 
ALONG THE LEON COUNTY LINE. 
A FEW MORE AS YOU HEAD FURTHER 
EAST OUT INTO MADISON COUNTY. 
THOSE CONTINUING ON UP THROUGH 
BROOKS COUNTY AND COOKE COUNTY. 
NOT SEVERE, NOT GETTING ANY 
SIGNS OF ROTATION, BUT IT CAN 
PUSH THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE 
WINDS IN EXCESS OF 40 MILES AN 
HOUR DOWN TOWARD THE COAST. 
AND THESE BANDS THAT ARE STILL 
VERY INTENSE FROM THE EASTERN 
PARTS OF MILLER COUNTY AND INTO 
EARLY COUNTY, BAKER COUNTY, 
MITCHELL COUNTY. 
GETTING CLOSER TO DOUGHERTY 
COUNTY. 
MOVING FASTER THAN THAT NOW BUT 
I EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE 
OFF IN THAT DIRECTION. 
JUST TO GIVE YOU PERSPECTIVE 
WHEN WE SAY STRONGEST WINDS, IT 
LINES UP PRETTY WELL. 
IT GOES OUT TO ROUGHLY THE 
MITCHELL COUNTY LINE TO THE 
EAST. 
AND TO THE NORTHERN PARTS OF 
THE NORTH EASTERN PARTS OF 
EARLY COUNTY. 
AND AGAIN, THE CENTER IS MOVING 
THIS WAY SO BAKER COUNTY STILL 
COULD HAVE SOME OF THE STRONGER 
WIND GUSTS. 
WE HAVE A TORNADO WATCH IN 
EFFECT. 
THE HURRICANE WARNINGS WILL BE 
DISCONTINUED AS THE WINDS GET 
LIGHTER. 
THE EXTREME WIND WARNING NEAR 
THE EYE WALL. 
THOUGH IT HASN'T OFFICIALLY 
BEEN EXTENDED UP INTO BAKER 
COUNTY, YOU MAY NOT GET THE 
WARNING BUT YOU'LL GET THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR DAMAGING WIND 
GUSTS. 
AND THERE'S STILL THE THREAT 
FOR A FEW TORNADOES AND FOR 
SOME VERY HEAVY RAINFALL. 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA. 
CERTAINLY THAT IS NOT THE CASE 
ANY LONGER FOR NEW RAINFALL 
BEING A MAJOR PROBLEM ACROSS 
THE BIG BEND. 
ROUGHLY FROM WEST OF U.S. 19. 
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING AT 
THE MOST LIKELY AREAS, SEEING A 
FEW MORE INCHES OF RAINFALL. 
WE COULD START TO DROP THESE 
NUMBERS NOW. 
PROBABLY CUT THESE IN HALF. 
REDUCE THE COASTAL WIND 
ESTIMATES FROM 20 TO 40 MILES 
AN HOUR. 
WHILE THE WINDS, STILL THE 
POTENTIAL IS THERE NEAR THE 
CENTER OF SEEING 75 MILES AN 
HOUR GUSTS. 
OVERALL, WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE 
WEAKENING BUT EVERYTHING ELSE 
IS STILL IN PLAY. 
ESPECIALLY FOR OUR RESIDENTS 
WATCHING US IN SOUTHWEST 
GEORGIA. 
THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE A 
STRAIGHT GUST OR TWO TOPPING 50 
OR 60 MILES AN HOUR. 
YOU NEED TO LET THE FIRST 
RESPONDER CREWS GET OUT THERE 
AND STAY OUT OF THEIR WAY AN 
THINGS WILL GET A LOT QUICKER. 
THAT'S IT AGAIN. 
WE WILL TOSS IT BACK TO YOU. 
>> MIKE, THANK YOU. 
AND, GOVERNOR SCOTT WAS GIVING 
A BRIEFING A FEW MINUTES AGO. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE DON'T HAVE 
ANY CONFIRMED REPORTS OF 
FATALITIES NOW FROM THIS STORM. 
HE HAD BEEN GOING AROUND THE 
STATE AHEAD OF THIS STORM, GET 
OUT OF HARM'S WAY. 
EVACUATE. 
FOLLOW THE ORDERS. 
WE CAN'T REPLACE A LIFE. 
BUT WE CAN PREPLACE THE 
PROPERTY. 
THAT HAS BEEN HIS MESSAGE 
THROUGHOUT THIS. 
AND THAT WOULD BE SOME 
FANTASTIC NEWS IF THAT 
CONTINUES TO HOLD TRUE. 
>> IF THAT HOLDS. 
THAT'S RIGHT. 
>> SO FAR, NO CONFIRMED REPORTS 
OF FATALITIES IN FLORIDA FROM 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
>>> OUR CREWS ARE BEGINNING TO 
MOVE NOW. 
IT'S SAFER TO MOVE ABOUT. 
WE HOPE TO SHARE MORE VIDEOS AS 
THEY ARE ABOUT TO GET OUT AND 
ACTUALLY SEE FOR THEMSELVES. 
ALSO, WE WANT TO THANK ONE OF 
OUR VIEWERS WHO SENT THIS VIDEO 
OF US. 
YOU CAN SEE THIS TREE WOBBLING 
BEFORE IT FALLS. 
ONE OF THOUSANDS OF TREES IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
>> THIS IS THE VIDEO WE'RE JUST 
GETTING A LOT OF THESE PICTURES 
AND IMAGES IN FROM ALL OVER THE 
REGION, ESPECIALLY IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
AND THERE IT GOES. 
LOOK. 
THERE IT GOES. 
>> YOU CAN'T HEAR IT BUT I'M 
SURE THAT WAS QUITE A THUD. 
>> IT KIND OF FELL IN SLOW 
MOTION. 
>> WE HAVE SEEN SOME REMARKABLE 
PICTURES. 
ONE GENTLEMAN SENDING US A 
PHOTO OF A HUGE PINE OR OAK. 
BUT IT SPLIT AND FELL RIGHT IN 
FRONT OF HIS HOME. 
THANKFULLY FALLING IN THE 
OPPOSITE DIRECTION. 
>> THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER 
ONE WHERE IT CAME UP BY THE 
ROOTS AND FELL OVER. 
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS, IT'S 
JUST CUT THROUGH THE WOOD. 
>> ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES IN 
PANAMA CITY SENT OUT A PHOTO 
AND YOU COULD SEE THE TREES 
SHEARED AT THE SAME LEVEL BY 
THE WIND. 
>> THIS REMINDS ME OF TORNADO 
DAMAGE. 
WHERE IT'S JUST MOWING THINGS 
DOWN AND THE TREES ARE LOPPED 
OFF. 
IT'S JUST REALLY DEVASTATING 
WHEN THAT SORT OF WIND DAMAGE 
HAPPENS. 
>>> AND WE WERE EXPECTING 
TREMENDOUS STORM SURGE ALONG 
THE COASTLINE. 
THIS IS VIDEO FROM I BELIEVE 
THIS IS FROM PORT SAINT JOE. 
YOU CAN SEE THE WATER FLOWING 
IN THE STREET. 
AND YOU CAN SEE THE WIND. 
MOVING THROUGH THE STREET OF 
PORT SAINT JOE. 
INCREDIBLE STORM SURGE YOU'RE 
SEEING HERE. 
I THINK MIKE MENTIONED JUST A 
MOMENT AGO, THE TIDE IS GOING 
OUT. 
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY PROVIDE 
SOME RELIEF TO THIS FLOODING. 
THE INCREDIBLE WATER ON THE 
ROADS HERE. 
>> INSIDE THE BUSINESSES 
CLEARLY. 
>> AND INSIDE HOMES AND 
BUSINESSES. 
WE SAW ALSO THIS KIND OF 
RUSHING WATER IN DOWNTOWN 
APALACHICOLA. 
WE ARE ANXIOUS TO GET THERE AND 
SEE THE EXTENT OF HOW HIGH THAT 
WATER ROSE AND THE EXTENT OF 
THE DAMAGE IT LEFT BEHIND. 
>> A LOT OF TREES TOP  TOPPLED 
ON HOMES. A 
LOT OF CARS, THEY DON'T HAVE A 
GARAGE, THEY PARK OUTSIDE AND 
THE TREE COMES DOWN AND SMASHES 
THAT CAR. 
>> OR IT SMASHED THE GARAGE AND 
THEN THE CAR IN THAT ONE CASE. 
>> A TWO FOR ONE DEAL THERE. 
>> RIGHT NOW, PANAMA CITY WAS 
RIGHT NEAR WHERE THE STORM CAME 
ASHORE. 
IT HAS EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS 
DAMAGE. 
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE. 
WE'VE SEEN SOME INCREDIBLE 
PICTURES OF ROOFS PEELING OFF 
BUILDINGS. 
SIGNS, DEBRIS. 
HILLARY LANE IS IN PANAMA CITY 
FOR US THIS AFTERNOON WITH THIS 
UPDATE. 
>> Reporter: MICHAEL CRASHED 
ASHORE NEAR MEXICO BEACH 
FLORIDA AS ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL STORMS TO EVER HIT THE 
U.S. MAINLAND. 
JUST SHY OF A CATEGORY 5 
HURRICANE. 
155 MILES AN HOUR WINDS CRASHED 
AT THE COAST. 
MICHAEL SNAPPED TREES LIKE 
TOOTHPICKS. 
FEELED SIDING OFF OF BUILDINGS 
AND RIPPED OFF ROOFS. 
IT DOWNED POWER LINES KNOCKING 
OUT ELECTRICITY TO 280,000 
CUSTOMERS. 
FORECASTERS SAY MICHAEL WILL 
DUMP OVER A FOOT OF RAIN AND 
ISSUE A 14-FOOT STORM SURGE IN 
SOME AREAS. 
>> WHEN THE SURGE COMES IN, YOU 
HAVE NO CONTROL. 
THERE IS SO MUCH PRESSURE AND 
IT PUSHES EVERYTHING IN AND 
SUCKS EVERYTHING OUT. 
>> Reporter: THE WIND MAKES IT 
HARD TO STAND UP STRAIGHT. 
FOR SOME PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T 
EVACUATE, PANIC SET IN. 
>> I MAY NOT BE HERE TOMORROW. 
I DON'T WANT TO CRY ON CAMERA. 
BUT THIS IS WHAT WE GOT TO DEAL 
WITH. 
>> Reporter: FEMA ADMINISTRATOR 
BROCK LONG UPDATED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP ON THE STORM IN THE OVAL 
OFFICE. 
HE SAYS THE HURRICANE'S EYE 
SHOWN HERE FROM THE 
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION IS 
LARGE AND DANGEROUS. 
>> SOME PEOPLE SAY IT IS 
SIMILAR TO AN EF3 TORNADO 
MAKING LANDFALL. 
>> Reporter: IT PASSES THROUGH 
GEORGIA. 
FORECASTERS SAY IT IS UNLIKE 
ANYTHING STORM EVER SEEN 
BEFORE. 
HILLARY LANE, CBS NEWS, PANAMA 
CITY BEACH FLORIDA. 
>>> AND THOSE ARE THE IMAGES OF 
THE CUSHIONS. 
THE BEACH CUSHIONS FROM THE 
LOUNGE CHAIRS BEING TOSSED 
AROUND LIKE TOYS AND FLUNG INTO 
THE WATER AND SWIRLING. 
>> THE POWER OF THIS STORM. 
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS 
STORM FOR A VERY LONG TIME. 
AND THE WRONG KIND OF RECORDS 
IT'SSETTING. 
>> AND WE'RE STILL GETTING MORE 
AND MORE IMAGES FROM THE PANAMA 
CITY BEACH AREA. 
THOSE NEW IMAGES ARE 
INCREDIBLE. 
>> OR SISTER STATION IN PANAMA 
CITY WAS OFF THE AIR. 
THEY WERE EXPERIENCING 
TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AT THEIR 
STATION. 
HIDING IN HALLWAYS. 
WE'RE HOPING THINGS ARE BETTER 
THERE FOR THEM AND THAT THEY 
WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME SHARING 
IMAGES FROM THEIR COMMUNITY. 
BUT, THE DEVASTATION IN PANAMA 
CITY IS TREMENDOUS. 
>> AND WE SAW A TWEET FROM A 
HOSPITAL IN PANAMA CITY WHERE 
THERE WAS DAMAGE. 
CRACKED WINDOWS, TORN APART 
WALLS AT THE HOSPITAL. 
THEY HAD TO MOVE SOME PATIENTS 
TO ANOTHER SECTION OF THE 
HOSPITAL TO GET THEM INTO 
SAFETY. 
>> THINGS ARE IMPROVING HERE, 
BUT THE STORM IS FAR FROM OVER. 
WE HAVE GRAY SKIES OUTSIDE OUR 
STUDIOS. 
HAD A FEW DIPS IN OUR POWER. 
AND A LOT OF STRANGE NOISES 
OUTSIDE. 
WE'RE RIDING THIS STORM OUT AS 
WELL. 
WE WANT TO CHECK IN THE STORM 
MAKING ITSELF KNOWN IN SOUTH 
GEORGIA RIGHT NOW. 
SO LET'S CHECK IN WITH EMMA 
WHEELER IN CAIRO. 
>> Reporter: ALL RIGHT GUYS. 
ANOTHER UPDATE HERE IN CAIRO. 
WE'RE AT THE CAIRO FAMILY 
WORSHIP CENTER. 
A SHELTER OPEN FOR ANYBODY 
AROUND HERE. 
THERE'S ALMOST 200 PEOPLE HERE 
RIGHT NOW. 
THEY OPEN UP AT ABOUT 8:00 LAST 
NIGHT. 
AND THEY ONLY HAD 40 LAST 
NIGHT. 
A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE COMING IN 
TODAY. 
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY POWER INSIDE 
GRADY EMC. 
THEY'RE REPORTING AT OVER 
12,000 POWER OUTAGES IN THE 
AREA. 
THAT'S ALMOST ALL OF THEIR 
CUSTOMERS. 
THEY HAVE ABOUT 13,000 
CUSTOMERS. 
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
RIGHT NOW. 
THE WIND IS BLOWING STRONG. 
THIS IS AS STRONG AS IT'S BEEN. 
IT'S STILL COMING IN WAVES BUT 
THE TREES ARE BENDING, THE RAIN 
IS SIDEWAYS. 
THIS IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE 
RIGHT NOW. 
AND ALL THROUGHOUT THE AREA, 
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING. 
WE'RE GETTING FAMILY MEMBERS AT 
THE SHELTER TALKING ABOUT TREES 
THAT ARE DOWN. 
THEY'RE GETTING TEXTS FROM 
FAMILY MEMBERS ABOUT WHAT'S 
GOING ON. 
YOU KNOW. 
LIKE I SAID BEFORE, THEY WILL 
STAY OPEN UNTIL THE STORM 
PASSES. 
PEOPLE ARE ASKED NOT TO BE OUT 
ON THE ROADS. 
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. 
STAY INDOORS. 
WE'RE SAFE HERE. 
EVERYONE IN HERE, WE'RE TRYING 
TO STAY POSITIVE. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE STILL 
FEELING GOOD ABOUT BEING HERE. 
WE'LL CHECK IN A LITTLE BIT 
LATER. 
REPORTING IN CAIRO, EMMA 
WHEELER, WCTV, EYEWITNESS NEWS. 
>> YOU CAN TELL WHAT THE 
CONDITIONS ARE THERE. 
>> EMMA'S HAIR TOLD THE STORY. 
>> IT DOES. 
IT DOES. 
>> SWIRLING AROUND. 
>> AND THINGS LOOK A LITTLE 
CALMER WITH ALICIA. 
YOU CAN SEE THE STORM IN SOUTH 
GEORGIA, THEY ARE GETTING A LOT 
OF WIND AND RAIN. 
>> AND A LOT OF POWER OUTAGES. 
WE WANT TO SHARE PICTURES OF 
THE DAMAGE COMING IN FROM YOU 
THE VIEWERS. 
YOU SEE THE TREE CLEAR ACROSS 
THIS ROAD. 
AND A LOT OF TREE AND LEAF 
DEBRIS WITH IT AND THE FIRE 
DEPARTMENT THERE HELPING WITH 
THE CLEANUP OR AT LEAST MOVING 
THAT TREE OFF THE ROAD SO THE 
ROAD CAN BE PASSABLE AGAIN. 
THIS IS THE THING YOU WILL SEE 
WIDESPREAD ACROSS NOT ONLY 
TALLAHASSEE BUT THE BIG BEND 
AND MUCH OF NORTH FLORIDA AND 
SOUTH GEORGIA. 
>> THIS IS THE CHALLENGE MOVING 
FORWARD. 
YOU CAN SEE OFFICERS DOING WHAT 
THEY CAN TO CLEAR DEBRIS OUT OF 
THE ROADWAYS. 
THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING EFFORT 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TO 
TRY TO CLEAR THE TREES AND 
ROADWAYS. 
AGAIN, A REMINDER THAT IF YOU 
CAN, PLEASE STAY ARE YOU ARE 
NOW. 
DON'T VENTURE OUT. 
A LOT OF THE ROADWAYS ARE 
CLOSED. 
IT COULD LEAD TO LENGTHY 
DETOURS AND IT COULD BE 
DANGEROUS IN TERMS OF WIRES 
DOWN. 
LIMBS DOWN. 
AS THEY SAID, SOMETIMES, THE 
TREES WILL TOPPLE LATER. 
YOU KNOW. 
THE GROUND IS SATURATED AND 
SOMETIMES THEY'LL FALL AFTER 
THE STORM HAS PASSED. 
>> YOU SEE THAT IN THESE CASES 
WHERE A DAY OR TWO OR A WEEK 
LATER THE TREES HAVE BEEN 
WEAKENED. 
THEN THE TREE GOES OVER AS 
WELL. 
SO IT'S LIKE A LINGERING 
IMPACT. 
>> AND MARIEL MENTIONED 160,000 
PEOPLE ARE WITHOUT POWER RIGHT 
NOW. 
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS TO RESTORE THAT. 
THERE ARE CREWS FROM ALL OVER 
THE REGION HERE TO HELP WITH 
THAT. 
THEY ARE STAGED HERE AND ABLE 
TO GO OUT AND START RESTORING 
POWER. 
THAT IS A PROCESS. 
EVERYONE HOPES WE CAN BE 
PATIENT THROUGH THAT. 
>>> LET'S TAKE A LIVE LOOK AT 
PANAMA CITY NOW. 
THIS IS RIGHT NEAR WHERE THE 
STORM WENT THROUGH. 
THIS LOOKS LIKE A DRIVING SHOT 
ALONG THE WATER. 
THIS IS COMING TO US LIVE FROM 
ONE OF OUR AFFILIATES OVER 
THERE. 
YOU SEE THE DOWNED POWER LINES. 
>> HUGE DEBRIS THERE ON THE 
ROADWAYS. 
THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS 
TIME THE BE ON THE ROAD. 
SOME OF THEM SEEM THE BE LOPPED 
OFF HALFWAY UP. 
EXTENSIVE DAMAGE IN THE PANAMA 
CITY BEACH AREA. 
>> UNBELIEVABLE IMAGES. 
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHAT THE 
TREES LOOKED LIKE BEFORE. 
BUT I GUESS THEY HAD FULL 
CANOPIES AND LEAVES. 
>> YOU CAN SEE WHERE THEY ARE 
SNAPPED IN HALF. 
THAT'S THE POWER OF THE WINDS. 
WHEN THIS STORM CAME ASHORE 
JUST EAST OF PANAMA CITY TODAY, 
IT CAME ASHORE AS A CAT 4. 
UNPRECEDENTED IN THIS AREA. 
>> THERE'S A POWER LINE LEANING 
OVER THERE. 
>> I'M NOT SURE WHO IS DRIVING  
THIS CAR, BUT BE CAREFUL. 
>> LOOK AT THE OTHER TRAFFIC ON 
THE ROAD. 
PEOPLE ARE GETTING OUT TRYING 
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON I 
GUESS. 
>> THESE IMAGES HONESTLY REMIND 
ME OF GOING TO SEE THE DAMAGE 
AFTER HURRICANE IVAN. 
VERY SIMILAR. 
A LOT OF THE TREES JUST 
COMPLETELY BLOWN TO THE SIDE. 
AND MANY OF THEM SNAPPED IN 
HALF. 
>> THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN I 
WAS THERE, THE AFTERMATH OF 
KATRINA HONESTLY. 
WHAT SOME OF THE TREES LOOK 
LIKE AS WELL. 
AND, IT LOOKS LIKE A DEBRIS 
PILE THERE FROM WHAT WAS A SIGN 
THAT WAS KNOCKED DOWN. 
AND, LIKE I SAID, LOOKS LIKE A 
WAR ZONE. 
UNFORTUNATELY. 
>> AND MIKE MCCALL IS HERE, 
YOU'VE BEEN WITH US THROUGHOUT 
THIS ENTIRE STORM. 
YOU AND ALL OF THE 
METEOROLOGISTS AND THE WEATHER 
TEAM. 
SO THANKS FOR STICKING WITH US 
ALL NIGHT LONG TO MAKE SURE 
EVERYONE HAS THE BEST 
INFORMATION. 
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW? 
THIS STORM IS NOT OVER. 
AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S 
NEXT. 
>> NO, IT'S NOT OVER. 
AND WHILE IT'S GETTING BETTER, 
IT'S ABSOLUTELY A MUCH WEAKER 
STORM NOW THAN IT WAS WHEN IT 
MADE LANDFALL. 
BUT, WE HAVE NOT SEEN, WE HAVE 
NOT HAD ANY OFFICIAL REPORTS IN 
OUR AREA OF SEEING THOSE WINDS 
UPWARDS OF 100 MILES AN HOUR. 
DID SEE A GUST IN MARIANA AT 
102. 
DOWN TOWARD THE COAST, WE HAD 
WINDS AT THE TINDEL AIR FORCE 
BASE GUSTING TO 149 BEFORE 
THEIR EQUIPMENT FAILED. 
CERTAINLY A HISTORY OF 
PRODUCING 100 PLUS MILES AN 
HOUR WINDS ACROSS THE EMERALD 
COAST AS IT MOVES OFF TOWARD 
THE NORTHEAST. 
AND EVEN UP INTO JACKSON 
COUNTY. 
NOW, WE'RE SEEING THE WHOLE 
SYSTEM START TO TAKE THE 
EFFECTS OF SOME DRIER AIR 
COMING IN. 
STRONGER WIND SHEAR COMING 
TOGETHER. 
BUT THE RADAR STILL CLEARLY 
SHOWING THE CENTER. 
IT DOESN'T LOOK NEARLY AS 
FORMIDABLE. 
DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU TOO 
MUCH. 
IF YOU'RE IN SOUTH GEORGIA OR 
NORTH OF 84, WEST OF 19, THAT'S 
PRETTY MUCH THE AREA THAT COULD 
STILL SEE THESE 50 TO 60 TO 70 
MILES AN HOUR GUSTS. 
ESPECIALLY NEAR THAT CENTER. 
EVEN BEYOND THAT, WHILE OVERALL 
CONDITIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY 
IMPROVING, YOU GET SOUTH OF 84, 
YOU GET DOWN INTO GADSTON, 
LEON, ON OVER TOWARD BROOKS, 
YEAH, CONDITIONS ARE IMPROVING. 
BUT, STILL, THESE LITTLE 
SQUALLS COULD STILL BRING DOWN 
SOME 50 OR 60 MILES AN HOUR 
GUSTS. 
QUICK ONES. 
BUT NONETHELESS, IT'S STILL A 
LITTLE TOO DANGEROUS TO VENTURE 
OUT. 
ABSOLUTELY THE WINDS ARE 
GETTING LIGHTER AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO DO THAT. 
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY 
UNNECESSARY RISKS. 
HERE AT THE CENTER, MILLER 
COUNTY MOVING INTO EARLY 
COUNTY. 
BAKER COUNTY. 
UP TOWARD MILLFORD, LIKELY 
DAMAGING WIND GUSTS WITH THAT. 
THESE OTHER LITTLE BANDS THAT 
EXTEND TO THE EAST OF CAMILLA 
AND SPENCE AND GRADY COUNTY. 
NOT FAR FROM THOMAS COUNTY. 
STILL COULD SEE NOW, IT MAY BE 
ALOFT. 
WE'VE SEEN SEVERAL PICTURES 
WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE THE TREE 
TOPS ARE BLOWING BUT THERE IS 
JUST A LITTLE BREEZE AT GROUND. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THIS TOO 
LIGHTLY JUST YET. 
ANY OF THESE LITTLE SQUALLS 
COULD PUSH SYSTEM OF THE 
STRONGER WINDS TO THE SURFACE. 
THIS IS OVER THE LAST HOUR. 
MOVEMENT OVER CENTRAL MILLER 
COUNTY. 
NORTHEAST PARTS OF EARLY COUNTY 
AND THE SQUALLS ARE ROTATING 
BACK TOWARD DOTHAN AND JACKSON 
COUNTY WHERE THEY HIT 
PARTICULARLY HARD WITH NUMEROUS 
REPORTS OF DOWNED TREES. 
EVERYBODY WITHIN 70 MILES OF 
THE CENTER OF THE SYSTEM. 
THESE OTHER SQUALLS A LITTLE 
MORE REMOVED. 
TWO THINGS THAT COULD HAPPEN. 
WELL THREE. 
YOU COULD GET SOME VERY HEAVY 
RAINFALL. 
AND SINCE THEY ARE TRAINING A 
LITTLE BIT FOLLOWING ALMOST THE 
SAME SPOT, YOU COULD SEE SOME 
FLASH FLOODING IN SPOTS. 
THAT'S PART ONE. 
PART TWO, THESE COULD FORM SOME 
OF THE STRONGER WINDS. 
YOU COULD SEE TROPICAL STORM 
WIND GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 40 
MILES AN HOUR. 
AND, CAN'T RULE OUT STILL THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR A FEW 
TORNADOES. 
WE'VE NOT SEEN THE ROTATING 
STORMS. 
THAT IS A POSSIBILITY. 
NOTICE HOW THE LINE EXTENDS 
DOWN THROUGH MADISON COUNTY. 
THOUGH WE'RE NOT SEEING MUCH 
COMING IN FROM THE COAST. 
THAT'S TYPICALLY OUR BIGGEST 
CONCERN WITH THOSE ROTATING 
STORMS BUT WE'LL CONTINUE TO 
WATCH THESE THROUGHOUT TAYLOR, 
LAFAYETTE, SWANEE, HAMILTON. 
THEN YOU GET A LITTLE BIT 
FURTHER TOWARD THE WEST. 
HERE'S THE OTHER STUFF ROTATING 
AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF JACKSON 
COUNTY. 
DOWN TO GADSTON AND LEON. 
THESE SQUALLS DON'T LOOK 
IMPRESSIVE ON RADAR, BUT COULD 
PRODUCE 50 MILES AN HOUR PLUS 
GUSTS. 
THE OVERALL WIND FIELD, YES, I 
KNOW IT'S GETTING LIGHTER BUT 
BE CAREFUL OF THE GUSTS. 
TREES WHICH MAY HAVE FALLEN 
THREE-FOURTHS OF THE WAY. 
ALL IT NEEDS IS ONE MORE GUST 
TO PUT IT DOWN INTO AN AREA 
NEAR YOUR HOME OR CAR. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO VENTURE OUT 
IF THOSE GUSTS ARE STILL AROUND 
YOU. 
INCLUDING THESE THAT ARE COMING 
UP THROUGH PARTS OF BRADFORD 
AND THE WEST SIDE OF 
TALLAHASSEE. 
A FEW OF THE SQUALLS COMING 
THROUGH QUINCY UP TOWARD 
CHATTAHOOCHEE. 
GO BACK OUT TO THE WIDER VIEW. 
GET A BETTER IDEA OF THE 
CIRCULATION. 
YOU GET SOUTH OF I-10. 
IT DOES DEFINITELY GET A LOT 
BETTER BUT WE'RE STILL WATCHING 
SOME OF THESE LITTLE BANDS, 
THESE SQUALLS COMING IN FROM 
THE GULF OF MEXICO. 
AND WE STILL HAVE A TORNADO 
WATCH IN EFFECT UNTIL 2:00, IT 
WILL LIKELY BE DISCONTINUED 
EARLIER THAN THAT, ESPECIALLY 
FOR THE BIG BEND. 
WE DON'T WANT TO PUT OUR GUARD 
DOWN AFTER ALL OF THIS. 
HAVEN'T HAD THE WARNINGS. 
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY. 
MANY STATIONS OFF THE GRID NOW, 
THAT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE WITH 
A LANDFALLING SYSTEM. 
YOU GET THE WIND DATA AND JUST 
AS THE WIND GETS STRONG, YOU 
LOSE IT. 
SO WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY NEW 
DATA COMING FROM THAT AREA. 
SUSTAINED WINDS OF 39 IN 
TALLAHASSEE. 
YOU MAY SAY THE WINDS ARE 
GETTING LIGHTER BUT THAT'S 
STILL TROPICAL STORM FORCE, 39 
MILES AN HOUR IS STILL THE 
BOTTOM END OF TROPICAL STORM 
WINDS. 
IN ALBANY, NOTICE THE DIRECTION 
COMING IN FROM THE EAST. 
SO, THERE'S YOUR CIRCULATION AS 
THE CENTER MOVES, AGAIN, OUT OF 
EARLY MILLER COUNTY RATHER INTO 
ROUGHLY EARLY BAKER COUNTY 
LINE. 
CHECKING OUT THE GUSTS, THESE 
ARE THE MOST RECENT GUSTS. 
61 MILES AN HOUR GUSTS. 
STILL IN TALLAHASSEE. 
GUST OF 78 IN ALBANY. 
THE POWER IS STILL THERE. 
GUSTING NEARLY 50 MILES AN HOUR 
IN VALDOSTA. 
THAT LITTLE SQUALL OF SHOWERS 
IS PROOF YOU'LL HAVE THE GUSTS 
THAT COULD EXCEED 40 TO PERHAPS 
50 MILES AN HOUR. 
THE BIG SATELLITE VIEW, YOU CAN 
SEE AN UNCOMFORTABLE LOOK AT 
THIS CLASSIC POWERFUL HURRICANE 
THAT CAME ASHORE NEAR MEXICO 
BEACH. 
NOW, IS STARTING TO FILL IN. 
AND WEAKEN AS ALL THE OTHER 
IMPACTS ARE BEING OVER LAND AND 
HAVING DRIER AIR. 
WORKING ON IT. 
STILL WE HAVE THE OUTER BANDS 
AND SQUALLS THAT CAN PRODUCE 
THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS. 
THE DRIER AIR AND THE COLD 
FRONT. 
THAT'S STILL ON THE WAY. 
THE GOOD NEWS IS THE FRONT IS 
NOT GOING THE BRING US ANY 
RAINFALL. 
IT WILL BE A WARM AND HUMID DAY 
FOR ALL OF YOUR CLEANUP EFFORTS 
SO BE CAREFUL OUT THERE. 
BUT THEN, BY TOMORROW NIGHT, 
FOR ALL OF YOU THAT WILL BE 
WITHOUT POWER FOR AT LEAST A 
FEW NIGHTS, MAYBE SEVERAL 
NIGHTS, IT WILL BE A WHOLE LOT 
COOLER. 
TOMORROW NIGHT INTO FRIDAY 
MORNING. 
FRIDAY NIGHT, SATURDAY MORNING. 
LOW 60s , THEN UPPER 50s . YOU 
CAN OPEN THE WINDOWS AND PUT A 
BLANKET ON THE BED. 
WHICH WILL BE GREAT AFTER WHAT 
WE'RE DEALING WITH. 
THE FUTURECAST SHOWS HOW 
QUICKLY THAT MOVES OUT. 
THE RAIN WILL BE RAPIDLY 
DEPARTING. 
IT'S NOT GOING TO SUDDENLY 
BECOME SUNNY, BUT A GOOD CHUNK 
OF THE AREA WILL SEE MORE 
SUNSHINE AND START TO GET THAT 
REAL DRYING TREND DOWN TOWARD 
THE COAST. 
TIDES ARE GOING OUT. 
LOW TIDES COMING ROUGHLY 
BETWEEN 9:45 AND 9:36. 
AND 9:59. 
EXCEPT A LITTLE LATER THAN 
THAT. 
THAT WILL HELP. 
IT WILL GET THERE, THE SURGE IS 
DOWN TOWARD THE COAST. 
JUST BE CAREFUL AND STILL THE 
THREAT FOR FLASH FLOODING. 
ESPECIALLY FROM, SAY, MILLER 
COUNTY AND UP INTO EARLY BAKER, 
MITCHELL, THAT'S WHERE WE STILL 
HAVE SOME FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS 
IN EFFECT IN THAT EXTREMELY 
HEAVY RAINFALL. 
ALL THE PARAMETERS. 
ALL THE ELEMENTS WE HAVE BEEN 
TALKING ABOUT SO LONG. 
YOU HAVE SEEN THIS GRAPHIC 
PROBABLY 100 TIMES. 
WE CONTINUE TO DROP THE 
NUMBERS. 
THE POTENTIAL IS THERE. 
THIS IS MAINLY AS YOU GET 
CLOSER TO THE CENTER WHERE YOU 
COULD SEE 75 MILES AN HOUR 
GUSTS. 
DOWN TOWARD THE COAST IN 
GENERAL. 
20 TO 40 MILES AN HOUR. 
AS WE KNOW, JUST A LITTLE 
FURTHER INLAND, WE HAD GUSTS TO 
60 WITHIN THE LAST HOUR, IT'S 
STILL POSSIBLE FOR ANOTHER 
COUPLE OF HOURS ALONG WITH THE 
STORM SURGE FLOODING. 
IT'S ALL GETTING BETTER. 
JUST NOT QUITE YET. 
IT WILL BE A PROCESS. 
A SLOW PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE 
EVENING HOURS. 
WE'LL CERTAINLY KEEP YOU 
POSTED. 
THAT'S IT. 
I'M GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE 
BREAK. 
GRAB A QUICK DRINK OF WATER AND 
CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU UPDATED 
NOT JUST HERE, BUT ONLINE. 
WE HAVE STILL, THE WHOLE 
WEATHER TEAM KEEPING TRACK OF 
EVERYTHING. 
ROB AND CHARLES ARE RIGHT 
AROUND THE CORNER UPDATING 
SOCIAL MEDIA. 
SO THERE AND HERE, WE'LL KEEP 
YOU SAFE AND KEEP YOU UPDATED. 
>> THANK YOU MIKE. 
CHARLES IS SHARING INCREDIBLE 
NUMBERS. 
THESE ARE WIND SPEEDS FROM THE 
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE.

BAY, 101. 
SO THESE INCREDIBLE NUMBERS 
JUST BEING RELEASED BY THE 
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE. 
SPEAK TO EVERYTHING OUR WEATHER 
TEAM HAS BEEN LOOKING INTO. 
>> AND I MISSED THIS ONE. 
129 MILES AN HOUR AT TINDLE AIR 
FORCE BASE. 
>> UNBELIEVABLE. 
HARD TO IMAGINE. 
AND, WE ARE JUST GETTING 
PICTURES AND IMAGES OF DAMAGE 
FROM YOU GUYS OUT THERE. 
BY THE MINUTE. 
COMING IN. 
IT SHOWS THE EXTENT OF THE 
DAMAGE AND TREES ON CARS. 
TREES ON HOUSES, FENCES, ON 
EACH OTHER. 
>> AND INTENSE FLOODING. 
INTENSE FLOODING. 
>> YEAH. 
THE POWER OUTAGE SITUATION IS 
GROWING. 
IT'S NOT GOOD. 
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE 
AT THIS POINT. 
KATIE JOINS US WITH AN UPDATE 
FROM THE NEWS ROOM. 
>> YOU SPOKE ABOUT INCREDIBLE 
NUMBERS WHEN TALKING WIND 
SPEEDS. 
160,000 PEOPLE WITHOUT 
ELECTRICITY DUE TO THE STORM. 
WE'RE STARTING WITH ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST OUTAGES. 
DUKE ENERGY REPORTING MORE THAN 
32,000 CUSTOMERS IN THE 
PANHANDLE WHO HAVE LOST POWER. 
TALKWIN ELECTRIC REPORTING MORE 
THAN 35,000 CUSTOMERS WITHOUT. 
AND THE CITY OF TALLAHASSEE NOW

THAN 25,000 PEOPLE. 
THESE NUMBERS FLUID, CONTINUING 
TO GROW. 
CONTINUING TO BE UPDATED. 
AND WE'RE KEEPING AN EYE ON 
THEM SO WE CAN KEEP YOU ALL 
UPDATED AT HOME AS WELL. 
REPORTING LIVE IN THE NEWS 
ROOM, KATIE CAPLIN. 
>> AND MARIEL REPORTING MOMENTS 
AGO CREWS ARE ALLOWED TO RETURN 
TO THE ROADWAYS. 
AND HOPEFULLY START CLEARING 
SOME OF THE TREES MAKING SURE 
THAT THE WIRES THAT ARE DOWN. 
I'M SURE THERE ARE SO MANY 
POWER LINES DOWN IN OUR 
COMMUNITIES MAKING SURE THAT 
THEY ARE NOT LIVE ANY LONGER. 
AND THAT IT'S SAFE TO MOVE 
ABOUT. 
BUT, THE BEST ADVICE FROM 
EVERYONE TONIGHT. 
STAY HOME. 
STAY OFF THE ROAD. 
GOVERNOR SCOTT SAYS THERE ARE 
NO CONFIRMED FATALITIES FROM 
THE STORMMENT WE WANT TO MAKE 
SURE ONCE WE SURVIVE THE WORST 
OF IT, FOLKS DON'T GO OUT AND 
GET IN HARM'S WAY ON THE ROADS 
AFTERWARD EITHER. 
>> TOO OFTEN, WE SEE THAT. 
WHETHER THEY ARE OUT ON THE 
ROADS OR TRYING TO CLEAN UP ON 
THE ROOF. 
TRYING TO PUT A TARP ON. 
AND THEY FALL. 
THEY HAVE A CHAIN SAW ACCIDENT. 
>>> WE'VE BEEN WATCHING 
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE 
AFFILIATE ON HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
MUCH MORE ON THE STORM 
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING HERE ON 
CBSN. 
RIGHT NOW, A QUICK BREAK. 
YOU'RE STREAMING CBSN. 
ANSWERED.
>> THAT IS A VERY FAIR QUESTION.
FACE THE NATION SUNDAYS.
FORCE ON THE CBS
EVENING NEWS FROM THE HURRICANE
ZONE.
FLORENCE TURNS DEADLY.
>> AT 12 NOON HIGH TIDE ROLLED
IN.
RIGHT NOW COW CAN'T TELL THE
RIVERS FROM THE ROAD.
>> THIS IS A MASSIVE OAK TREE
THAT WAS TOPPLED.
>> FOR MANY OF THESE EVACUEES
THEY ARE HOPING THEY WILL STILL
HAVE HOMES TO RETURN TO.
>> THIS IS SCARY.
>> THIS IS SOME OF THE WORST OF
FLORENCE.
HI EVERYONE.
HURRICANE MICHAEL SLAMMED THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON.
THE HISTORIC CATEGORY 4 STORM
MADE LANDFALL WITH TOP SUSTAINED
WINDS OF 155 MILES PER HOUR.
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION
CUSTOMERS IN FLORIDA ARE WITHOUT
POWER.
WE ARE SEEING PICTURES OF
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE AND
FLOODING.
SOME AREAS SAW 10 FEET OF STORM
SURGE.
THE HURRICANE HAS SLOWED A BIT
BUT IS STILL DELIVERING A HEAVY
EMPLOYEE AS IT MOVES INTO
ALABAMA AND GEORGIA.
JOINING ME NOW FOR THE LATEST IS
CBS WEATHER PRODUCER DAVID
PARKINSON.
SO DAVID, WHAT IS THE VERY
LATEST?
>> WE STILL HAVE A CATEGORY 3
STORM OR AT LEAST THAT WAS THE
CASE AT 6:58.
WE MAY GET AN UPDATE BHIEL --
WHILE WE ARE
ON THE AIR HERE.
THE STORM IS INTO GEORGIA AND
CONTINUING TO MOVE OFF TO THE
NORTH AND EAST AT A FAIRLY BRISK
CLIP.
115 MILE AN HOUR WINDS MOVING TO
THE NORTH-NORTHEAST AT 13 MILES
AN HOUR.
THEY HAVE CLEAR SKIES IN PANAMA
CITY AT THIS POINT.
THE BACK HALF OF THE STORM HAS
MOVED OFF THE COAST.
YOU STILL HAVE GOT -- A SOMEWHAT
DECENT EYE THERE.
IT HAS BEEN ERODING OVER THE
LAST COUPLE OF HOURS.
YOU SEEING THOSE DEEP ORANGES
AND REDS.
THAT IS WHERE YOU ARE HAVING THE
STRONGEST WIND AND ALSO THE
HEAVIEST RAIN.
>> WHAT DO PEOPLE NEED TO BE
MOST CONCERNED ABOUT AT THIS
POINT?
>> THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS GOING
TO BE ALL KINDS OF WIND CONCERNS
FROM POWER OUTAGES TO POTENTIAL
TORNADOS OVERNIGHT TONIGHT TO --
SOME OF THOSE WIND GUSTS THAT
COULD BE IN THE TRIPLE DIGITS
ALTHOUGH THOSE WILL BE BACKING
OFF FAIRLY QUICKLY AND THEN WE
TAKE A LOOK AT THE RAIN WITH
FLASH FLOOD WATCHES UP.
>> REMIND US HOW DID THIS
PARTICULAR STORM GET SO STRONG
SO QUICKLY?
>> WELL REALLY IT WAS SORT OF
THE PERFECT STORM IF YOU WILL.
WE HAD ALL OF THIS DRY AIR JUST
OFF TO THE WEST.
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS
SATURDAYAL LITE MAP HERE, SEE
WHERE THAT GRAY IS OVER THERE?
THAT IS WHERE THE DRY AIR WAS.
THAT SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO MIX IN
BUT IT DIDN'T DO IT.
IT WAS OVER INCREDIBLY WARM
WATER AND WATCH -- YOU CAN SORT
OF SEE THE LIFT AROUND THE
CENTER.
THAT IS THE STORM BECOMING MORE
AND MORE ORGANIZED.
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS MAP
AT THE START, AT 6:30 YESTERDAY,
OVER ABOUT THREE HOURS WE SAW
THIS EYE CLOSE OFF AND THIS JUST
RAPID INTENSIFICATION.
THAT IS WHEN WE REALIZED THIS IS
GOING TO BE A BEAST AND THEN IT
JUST KEPT GETTING STRONGER AND
STRONGER DURING THE DAY TO DAY.
>> WHAT'S THE PATH NOW?
WHERE IS THE STORM HEADED NEXT?
>> IN TERMS OF WHERE ITS HEADED
ITS GOING RIGHT OVER THE
CAROLINAS AND OUT THE
CHESAPEAKE.
IT WILL DO IT REALLY QUICKLY.
BY THE TIME YOU GET TO 2:00 A.M.
ON FRIDAY MORNING, ITS OFF THE
COAST OF NORFOLK.
SO THAT'S A PRETTY RAPID MOVE.
THAT IS WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT OUT
OF HURRICANES.
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT IN ANY OF
THE LAST ONES THAT HAVE MADE
LANDFALL.
THE WINDS REALLY STARTING TO
BACK DOWN.
IN THE NEXT COME OF HOURS WE
WILL GO DOWN TO PROBABLY JUST A
TROPICAL STORM AT THAT POINT.
WE SEE A 2 THAT THERE.
THAT WOULD INDICATE THE WIND
SPEEDS HAVE KNOCKED DOWN BELOW
110 MILES AN HOUR.
THAT IS GOOD.
ITS STARTING TO WEAKEN.
THE KEY THING HERE IS THE RAIN
OUT OF THIS STORM AS IT MAKES
IT'S WAY.
YOU COULD BE SEEING 4-8 INCHES
OF RAIN PARTICULARLY IN THAT
GEORGIA-SOUTH CAROLINA AREA.
>> ALL RIGHT.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH THIS.
DAVID PARKINSON, THANK YOU.
>> THE KEY THING HERE IN THAT
NORTH CAROLINA AREA, ITS NOT
QUITE THE AREA THAT HAD THE MOST
RAIN OUT OF FLORENCE BUT STILL
3-6 INCHES OF RAIN IN AN AREA
WHERE THE RIVERS HAVE STILL NOT
NECESSARILY GOTTEN BACK TO
NORMAL.
YOU WILL BE'' -- SEEING THOSE
RISING.
>> OKAY.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH IT.
THANK YOU.
>> SURE THING.
>> ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT AREAS
IS PANAMA CITY BEACH JUST WEST
OF WHERE MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL.
HERE IS SOME OF THE DAMAGE THE
WINDS DID THERE.
JEFF IS THERE WITH MORE.
>> THE SOUND UNMISTAKABLE, MORE
LIKE A JET LINER AT TAKEOFF.
>> OH MY GOD.
>> HERE IN PANAMA CITY BEACH WE
WERE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE
STORM AS IT BLASTED AWAY.
>> WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE
WORST OF HURRICANE MICHAEL.
THE CITY MANAGER TELLS US HE
THINKS ABOUT 50% OF RESIDENTS
HAVE LEFT TOWN.
AT THIS POINT THEY ARE NO LONGER
RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS.
IF SOMEONE HAS LIFE-THREATENING
EMERGENCY, THEY LIKELY WILL NOT
BE ABLE TO GET THERE.
>> WHEN MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL
ITS WINDS TOPPED OUT AT 155
MILES AN HOUR.
THAT IS JUST TO MILES AN HOUR
SHORT OF CATEGORY 5.
GUSTS MAY HAVE CLOCKED IN
HIGHER.
MANY WIND GAUGES BROKE.
>> THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
RIGHT UP AGAINST ALL WINDOWS.
>> IT WAS ENOUGH TO RIP ROOFTOPS
OFF BUILDINGS.
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE -- INSIDE
THE HOTEL WITH FLASHLIGHTS.
PRETTY MUCH HUNKERED DOWN DURING
THE WORST OF THE STORM.
GOING TO TRY TO GET BACK OUTSIDE
WHENEVER ITS SAFE TO ASSESS THE
DAMAGE
>> JUST TO THE EARTH LIES --
EAST
LIES THE TOURIST TOWN OF MEXICO
BEACH.
STORM SURGES UP TO 8 FEET AND
RAINFALL TOPPING 5 INCHES SUB
MERGED IN HOUSES THERE.
OTHER BUILDINGS LAY IN PILES.
MICHAEL IS THE LOWEST PRESSURE
HURRICANE TO STRIKE THE U.S.
MAINLAND SINCE 1969.
NOTHING THIS FEROCIOUS HAS EVER
HIT THE PANHANDLE.
>> JEFF REPORTING THERE.
WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT
SOME INFORMATION JUST COMING
INTO CBS NEWS.
THE GASTON COUNTY FLORIDA
SHERIFF'S OFFICE IS CONFIRMING
THAT ONE PERSON WAS KILLED BY A
FALLING TREE DURING THE STORM.
WE ARE TOLD THAT -- IT WAS A
PERSON KILLED BAY FALLING TREE
DURING THE STORM.
WE WILL GET ADDITIONAL DETAILS
BUT THIS IS NOW THE FIRST
REPORTED FATALITY WE ARE HEARING
ABOUT RIGHT NOW.
AGAIN THIS IS IN GASTON COUNTY
FLORIDA.
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE CONFIRMING
ONE PERSON WAS KILLED BY A
FALLING TREE.
JUST EAST OF MEXICO BEACH WITH
HURRICANE MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL
IS PORT SAINT JOE FLORIDA.
THE AREA IS ALREADY SEEING HEAVY
FLOODING WHICH IS BLOCKING ROADS
AND CAUSING DIFFICULTY FOR FIRST
RESPONDERS THERE.
>> HURRICANE MICHAEL SLAMMED
THERE EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.
HEAVY RAINS AND TREE SNAPPING
WINDS PULLALED THE FLORIDA
PANHANDLE.
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ROAD OUT THE
STORM AT HOME DESPITE BEING TOLD
TO GET OUT.
PORT SAINT JOE RESIDENTS WENT
INTO RESCUE MODE AFTER MICHAEL'S
12 FOOT STORM SURGE TRAPPED
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES.
VOLUNTEERS AND SMALL BOATS AND
BIG TRUCKS PUSHED THROUGH
STREETS BLOCKED BY TREES AND
SUBMERGED IN SEVERAL FEET OF
WATER.
DONNA DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO CHECK
ON HER FAMILY SO SHE USED OUR
CELLPHONE TO TELL HER TRAPPED
NEPHEW THAT HELP WAS ON THE WAY.
WITHIN MINUTES A DRIVER IN A BIG
PICKUP TRUCK PULLED UP TO THE
WATERLOG HOUSE AND CARRIED JEFF
PITS AND HIS DOG BUDDY TO HIGHER
GROUND.
>> HOW IS THE WATER LEVELS?
>> GOT UP TO 4 FEET IN THE
HOUSE.
>> IN THE HOUSE UP TO MY HIP.
>> THE DRIVER WAS A MAN NAMED
CHRIS.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TALK AS
HE DROVE BACK TO HELP MORE
PEOPLE BUT HIS ACTIONS SAID
PLENTY IN THIS SMALL COMMUNITY.
>> WHERE WOULD THESE PEOPLE BE
WITHOUT PEOPLE WITH BIG TRUCKS
AND BOATS IN.
>> WHERE IS ANYBODY WITHOUT
FRIENDS?
>> EVEN AS THIS STORM WAS
PASSING OVER HEAD, VOLUNTEERS
CAME OUT WITH CHAIN SAWS WORKING
TO CLEAR THE STREETS OF DOWNED
TREES.
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY,
HURRICANE FORCED WINDS DAMAGED
BUILDINGS AND EVEN FLIPPED OVER
THIS RV.
AS PEOPLE ASSESS THE DAMAGE,
DONNA IS JUST THANKFUL SHE
SURVIVED ONE OF THE BIGGEST
HURRICANES TO HIT THE FLORIDA
PANHANDLE.
>> HOW WAS IT TO FINALLY SEE HIM
ON THE BACK OF THAT TRUCK?
>> THAT WAS GOOD, GOOD.
WE CAN REST EASY NOW.
>> AND CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT
JOINS ME NOW.
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT CONDITIONS
WHERE YOU ARE?
>> AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS STILL
VERY WINDY.
THE WIND IS COMING THROUGH AT A
GOOD CLIP HERE.
IT WILL -- COME UP AND THEN IT
WILL DIE DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
WE ARE STILL GETTING SOME STEADY
GUSTS.
GOOD NEWS IF THERE IS ANY, TWO
THINGS, THE RAIN HAS REALLY
STOPPED IN THIS AREA AND SOME OF
THE FLOODING, SOME OF THE STORM
SURGE WE SAW EARLIER IS STARTING
TO RECEDE A LITTLE BIT.
THE BIG ISSUE IS GOING TO BE OF
COURSE CLEAN UP.
THAT IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM
THING.
WE HAVE SEEN TREES DOWN.
WE HAVE SEEN -- MATTER OF FACT,
PIECES OFFENSE THAT ARE
BASICALLY JUST STREWN ABOUT THAT
NEIGHBORHOOD AND ENDED UP IN
OTHER PEOPLE'S YARDS AS WELL.
THIS IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE
LONG TERM PROCESS OF THE CLEAN
UP.
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO SHOW
YOU OVER HERE, LET ME STEP OVER
HERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN SEE IT.
THE PANHANDLE HAS LOT OF THESE
BEAUTIFUL PINE TREES.
THEY ARE TALL AND THEY ARE
STRAIGHT.
GREAT DURING THE SUMMER BUT WHEN
ITS HURRICANE TIME, THEY WILL
SNAP IN HALF AND BRIN -- BRING
DOWN
ALL THE POWER LINES.
IT IS SNAPPED RIGHT IN THE
CENTER.
A LOT OF THESE ARE BLOCKING THE
ROADS.
AT THAT WILL BE A MAYOR JOR --
MAJOR
PART OF THE CLEAN UP
>> HAVE YOU SEEN FIRST
RESPONDERS OUT AND ABOUT?
>> WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM
TRICKLE OUT.
WE DID SEE SHERIFF DEPUTIES HERE
IN GULF COUNTY.
THEY WERE KIND OF CRUISING
AROUND BUT HAD BASICALLY LIMITED
CAPABILITIES OF WHAT THEY COULD
DO.
ONE OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
HERE TOLD US THAT -- THE
HOSPITALS ARE CLOSED.
ALL THE AMBULANCES ARE FARTHER
INLAND.
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL HELP IT
WON'T HAPPEN TILL AFTER THE
STORM.
WE DID SEE SOME PORT SAINT JOE
POLICE.
THEY HAD A REAL HIGH VEHICLE.
THEY WENT INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
BEHIND ME HERE.
SOME OF THESE HOMES WERE UNDER 4
FEET OF WATER.
WE WERE SEEING THEM DRIVE TO
THOSE AREAS.
WE SAW THEM PULL OUT AN ELDERLY
COUPLE P TAKE -- AND TAKE THEM
TO HIGHER GROUND.
THE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE COMING
OUT.
THE BIG THING PEOPLE WANT TO
SEE, THEY WANT TO SEE THE POWER
CREWS.
THEY WANT TO SEE THOSE ORANGE
FLASHING LIGHTS AND THOSE CHERRY
PICKERS CAUSE THAT MEANS
PROGRESS.
THAT MEANS SOON.
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL HAVE
ELECTRICITY.
>> HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TALK
TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THIS STORM
COMPARES TO OTHERS THAT MIGHT
HAVE HIT THE AREA?
>> THERE IS SOME PEOPLE WHO SAID
THEY REALLY COULDN'T COMPARE IT.
THERE WAS WIND THAT WAS A RAIN
EVENT AND IT KIND OF PERKED
PEOPLE'S EARS UP.
IT HAS BEEN DECADES SINCE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAS BEEN
THOUGHT OF IN THE AREA.
FOR HERE IN THIS AREA, PEOPLE
WERE LISTENING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE EVACUATED.
THEY WENT FARTHER INLAND.
INTERESTING NOTE THOUGH, IN PORT
SAINT JOE, THERE IS ABOUT 3500
PEOPLE AND -- SHERIFF DEPARTMENT
WAS TELLING US THAT ABOUT 60%
STAYED.
THEY STAYED IN THE AREA AND
DECIDED TO RIDE IT OUT.
WE ARE TRYING TO SEE IF THOSE
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME BACK.
THEY ARE COMING TO CHECK ON
THEIR PROPERTY.
THEY ARE COMING TO CHECK ON
THEIR BUSINESSES.
THEY ARE HAVING TO DO THAT FIRST
ASSESSMENT.
>> AND YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE ON
THE LOOK OUT FOR THOSE POWER
CREWS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE FOR
PEOPLE AS THEY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO
RECOVER ON?
>> IT IS.
THERE IS SOME PEOPLE -- WHO ARE
GOOD PREPPERS AND THEY HAVE
GENERATORS READY TO GO.
THEY WERE PART OF THAT CREW WHO
IS WAITING IN LINE AT A GAS
STATION TO FILL UP GAS TANKS.
THEY WERE MAYBE CHARGING THEIR
PHONES AND WHAT NOT IN CARS.
THERE IS NO CELL SIGNAL RIGHT
NOW HERE.
PRETTY MUCH DEAD IN THE AREA.
THE BIG CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE
FOR THE POWER CREWS, THEY WILL
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN
ROADS.
WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE CHAIN
SAW CREWS COME OUT FIRST, START
CLEARING SOME OF THE ROADS.
VOLUNTEERS HAVE STARTED DOING IT
AS WELL.
CLEARING SOME OF THOSE ROADS,
MOVING THE DEBRIS OFF THE ROADS
SO THOSE POWER CREWS CAN GO
DOWN, TAKE DOWN THE OLD LINES OR
PICK THEM UP, PUT A NEW POLE UP,
START STRINGING NEW CABLE UP AND
HOPEFULLY -- THEY KNOW IT WILL
BE SEVERAL DAYS.
THEY ARE JUST HOPING IT IS NOT
SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE THEY GET
POWER.
>> THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, ELAINE.
>> WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE
AFFILIATE FOR MORE ON THE STORM.
>> ITS STILL GUSTING TO 51 IN
TALLAHASSEE.
NEARLY THAT IN THOMASVILLE.
GUSTING TO NEARLY 70 MILES AN
HOUR IN ALBANY.
THIS IS STILL A POTENT STORM.
IT MIGHT BE HALF AS STRONG AS IT
TECHNICALLY WAS DOWN TOWARD THE
COAST.
IT IS TAIL DANGER -- DANGEROUS
ONE.
THE FUTURE CAST SHOWS HOW
QUICKLY THIS MOVES OUT.
BY THE TIME WE GET PAST
MIDNIGHT, THE CENTER IS LONG OUT
OF OUR VIEWING AREA.
STILL SOME BANDS MAY WRAP AROUND
PART OF THAT.
IT WILL CONTINUE TO GET BETTER
AND THEN IT EXIT IS AREA.
THE RAINFALL -- THE HEAVIEST BY
FAR WILL BE -- WITHIN ABOUT 50
MILES OR SO OF THE CENTER.
THAT IS ALBANY TO MULL TREE TO
EVEN BANE BRIDGE.
OVERALL THE 4 TO 8 INCHES IS
MORE OF TOTALS NOW AND CERTAINLY
NOT ADDITIONAL RAINFALL.
AN ADDITIONAL COUPLE OF INCHES
STILL A GOOD POSSIBILITY CLOSER
TO THAT CENTER.
THE WINDS ARE GRADUALLY DYING
DOWN.
ESPECIALLY DOWN TOWARD THE
COAST.
STILL A CHANCE FOR AN ISOLATED
TORNADO.
WE STILL HAVE SOME SURGE GOING
ON.
THAT PART HAS LIKELY PEAKED.
THE TIDE IS NOW GOING OUT.
WITHIN THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS
THE WIND WILL START TO SHIFT
ENOUGH TO GRADUALLY START PUSH A
LITTLE MORE OF THAT WATER OFF
OUT OF THE FLOODED AREAS.
IT WILL TAKE THE REST OF TONIGHT
AND INTO TOMORROW BEFORE YOU CAN
START TALKING ACT SAFELY MOVING
AROUND IN THOSE AREAS THAT
RECEIVED ALL THE STORM SURGE
FLOODING.
WE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP YOU
UPDATED.
IN A WHEN -- LITTLE WHILE WE
WILL BE GOING
BACK TO SOME PROGRAMMING.
WE WILL STILL HAVE UPDATES HERE
ON WCTV.
NOT TO MENTION OUR SOCIAL MEDIA
PLATFORMS OF TWITTER AND
FACEBOOK CONTINUING TO HAVE THE
WHOLE WEATHER CREW THAT WILL
CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND TRANSMIT
THE NEWEST DATA OUT THROUGH
THERE TOO.
>> OKAY.
THANKS.
THEY HAVE BEEN COVERING THIS
NONSTOP ALL NIGHT LONG.
EVERYONE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE
INFORMATION TO HELP KEEP THEM
SAFE THROUGHOUT THIS TIME
>> I WAS JUST READING AN E-MAIL
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PLANNING
TO VISIT AREAS AFFECTED BY
HURRICANE MICHAEL EARLY NEXT
WEEK THEREFORE GIVING SOMETIME
FOR REPAIRS AND SOME ASSESSMENT
AND SOME DAMAGE TO BE CLEANED UP
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THE VISIT
TO INTERFERE OR SLOW DOWN THAT
PROCESS.
HE DID HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH
ALL THREE GOVERNORS OF THE
AFFECTS STATES TO DAY AND
OFFERED -- ALL AND ANY FEDERAL
RESOURCES TO HELP WITH THE CLEAN
UP AND RECOVERY.
>> AND I THINK WE WILL NEED IT
ALL.
>> RIGHT NOW WE WANT TO CONNECT
WITH CHRIS.
THANK SO MUCH FOR JOINING US
AGAIN.
BEN IS NOW ABLE TO MOVE A LITTLE
BIT.
ARE YOUR DEPUTIES OUT ON THE
ROAD AGAIN AND WHAT HAVE THEY
SEEN?
>> I WAS LISTENING TO MIKE GIVE
THE RUN DOWN OF THE CURRENT
STATION.
DOWN HERE WE HAVE SEEN A
DECREASE IN THE SUSTAINED WINDS.
WE ARE STILL GETTING HEAVY GUSTS
QUITE FREAK EBTLY.
OUR -- FREAK EBT -- FREQUENTLY.
WE ARE CLEARING TREES AND DOWNED
LINES.
WE ARE HAVING A BIG PROBLEM WITH
NOW THAT EVERYBODY IS STARTING
TO SEE THE WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN,
EVERYBODY IS FLOODING N -- IN,
TRYING TO CHECK ON THEIR
PROPERTY.
ITS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME.
ALL THE WAY INTO TOMORROW
MORNING AND THE MIDDLE OF THE
MORNING TOMORROW.
WE HAVE GOT --
CAN'T GET INTO SAINT CREEK.
IT IS UNDERWATER.
THERE IS -- THE RIVER IS -- GONE
OVER THE BANKS AT HIGHWAY 98
AND -- IT EXTENDS OUT ON TO 98.
WE HAVE -- THAT PORTION OF 98
LOCKED DOWN.
WE ARE REALLY DEALING WITH A LOT
OF -- LOGISTICS HERE THAT ITS
MAKING IT VERY TOUGH ESPECIALLY
WHEN WE HAVE A BUNCH OF
RESIDENTS TRYING TO RETURN TO
THEIR HOMES ON THE COASTAL AREA
AND -- IT'S JUST -- THEY CAN'T
GET DOWN THERE.
THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING
THAT WILL LAST AT LEAST UNTIL
MID-MORNING TOMORROW BEFORE WE
CAN DETERMINE HOPEFULLY THAT
WATER WILL RECEDE WHERE MAYBE
YOU CAN START LETTING PEOPLE GO
BACK IN THERE
>> I KNOW, CHRIS, YOU HAD SOME
OTHER PROBLEMS BECAUSE -- YOU
OUTAGES AT THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
YOU WERE UNABLE TO SEND OUT
INFORMATION AND KEEP
COMMUNICATION DURING THE STORM.
IS THAT STILL THE CASE?
>> IT SEEMS TO BE ONE THING
AFTER ANOTHER.
>> WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE
AFFILIATE WCTV ON HURRICANE
MICHAEL.
MUH MORE ON THE STORM
THROUGHOUT THE -- EVENING.
RIGHT NOW QUICK BREAK.
YOU STREAMING CBSN.
THE DOW JONES
PLUNGED MORE THAN 800 POINTS
WEDNESDAY.
WHILE THE S&P 500 SANK MORE THAN
90 POINTS.
TECH COMPANIES SAW THE SHARPEST
LOSSES AS ANALYSTS SAY INVESTORS
ARE WORRIED ABOUT RISING
INTEREST RATES.
MARTIN IS LONDON BUREAU CHIEF
AND HE JOINS ME NOW.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE SUCH A
LARGE DROP TODAY IN.
>> I REALLY WAS.
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE START OF
THE TRADING KIND OF IN AND OUT
OF POSITIVE TERRITORY.
AN ORDINARY DAY.
THE LOSSES BEGAN TO MOUNT AND
THEN SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ESCALATE
AND TUMBLE.
WE SAW THE SHARP DECLINES.
YOU MENTION TECH STOCKS.
THE NASDAQ HAD ITS WORST DAY
THERE SEVEN YEARS TODAY.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING.
>> WHY IS THAT?
WHY DOES SOME TECH STOCKS SUFFER
BIG HITS?
>> THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO
RISING INTEREST RATES.
THE HIGHER THE INTEREST RATE AND
THE BORROWING THE COST THE MORE
PRESSURE THEIR PROFITS BECOMEúAL
FAKE SOME MONEY OUT -- TAKE SOME
MONEY OUT
OF THE MARKET AS RESULT.
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT
TAKING AS WE HEAD TO THE FINAL
MONTHS.
>> WELL SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE
OTHER FACTORS THAT HELPED FUEL
THE SELL OFF?
>> THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IT TO
DAY WHEN WE WAS CRITICAL OF THE
FEDERAL RESERVE AND THEIR
INTEREST RATE POLICY.
HE THINKS HE IS MOVING TOO FAST.
THERE ARE SOME THAT AGREE AND
THERE ARE OTHERS THAT DON'T.
IT WILL PROBABLY THAT INTO THE
END OF THE YEAR AND PROBABLY
INTO NEXT.
UNEMPLOYMENT AT THE LOWEST SINCE
1969.
WE ARE EARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE
EVERY WEEK.
INFLATION IS PRETTY TAME.
THE FED IS MOVING MAYBE A LITTLE
MORE QUICKLY FOR SOME AND MAYBE
NOT AS QUICK FOR OTHERS BECAUSE
THEY LOOK BACK TO THE FINANCIAL
CRISIS AND THINK -- FED WAS A
LITTLE SLOW BACK THEN AND LOOK
WHAT HAPPENED.
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, THE DOW
IS STILL AT A RECORD LEVEL.
IS THIS JUST A BLIP ON THE RADAR
SCREEN?
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL
HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY, HOW DOES
THAT PICTURE LOOK?
>> I STILL THINK ITS LOOKING
TERRIBLY WELL.
WE WILL PROBABLY SEE CORPORATE
PROFITS AROUND THIS QUARTER RISE
AROUND 20% AND AGAIN FOR THE
FINAL THREE MONTHS OF THE YEAR.
THAT IS REALLY HEALTHY EARNINGS.
WHAT INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN 2019?
PROSHLY MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT IS
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ON
GOING TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN
WASHINGTON AND BEIJING.
AT THE MOMENT THEY SIT AT $250
BILLION.
THEY WOULD RISE TO $500 BILLION
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
THAT COULD HAVE A REALLY
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CONSUMER
SPENDING AND THEN HAVE A
CASCADING EFFECT INTO STOCKS AND
EVERYTHING ELSE.
WE MAY NOT KNOW THE TRUE STORY
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW.
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE FIRST
WARNING SIGNS.
>> HOW QUICKLY CAN THE MARKET
REBOUND FROM WHAT WE HAVE JUST
SEEN?
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
I THINK WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE
FASCINATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS
OVERNIGHT IN THE ASIAN MARKETS.
CHINA HAS WOBBLED FOR THE LAST
FEW WEEKS A -- AS A RESULT OF
THE TRADE
WAR.
WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN
IS WITH THE BANK EARNINGS
BEGINNING ON FRIDAY AND THE
LARGER CORPORATE EARNINGS
STARTING NEXT WEEK WE WILL START
TO SEE SOME OF THOSE GOOD
NUMBERS.
WE COULD POTENTIALLY STEADY THE
SHIP.
I STILL THINK THE MARKET IS GOOD
UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR.
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A HEALTHY
CORRECTION.
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HURT TO
TAKE SOME OF THAT STEAM OUT.
>> SO IF YOU ARE AN INVESTOR
RIGHT NOW AND AND YOU ARE
FEELING A LITTLE NERVOUS, WHAT
ARE YOU THINKING?
>> I'D SAY DON'T WORRY.
IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN THE
MARKET AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF
THE COMPANIES YOU OWN YOU HAVE A
CHANCE TO BUY THEM MORE CHEAPLY
NOW.
IF YOU ARE WILLING TO BE PATIENT
YOU COULD MAKE A LITTLE MORE
MONEY.
IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE VALUE OF
YOUR 401(K) DECLINE A LITTLE
BIT, DON'T BE TERRIBLY
CONCERNED.
PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO
RISING INTERE RATES -- INTEREST
RATES.
THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN EXCELLENT
INDICATION OF WHAT TO DO NEXT
DON'T FORGET THE UNDERLYING --
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK CAN WORK
AND AS A RESULT THEY ARE GOING
TO BE ABLE TO SPEND.
SPENDING DRIVES 2 THIRDS OF THIS
ECONOMY.
THOSE SIMPLE EQUATIONS IN THE
OVERALL OF THE MARKET IS STILL
VERY GOOD.
I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE WILL
PROBABLY BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS.
>> ALL RIGHT.
GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.

>>> IN ANOTHER CORNER OF THE
U.S. WE ARE GETTING A LOOK AT
THE AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE
MICHAEL.
THIS IS MEXICO BEACH, FLORIDA.
THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINED HIS
REASONING FOR GOING TO
PENNSYLVANIA.
IN A TWEET WEDNESDAY HE SAID HE
DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT THE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ATTENDING
ADDING I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING
EVERYONE THIS EVENING.
THE PRESIDENT WILL ALSO ATTEND A
FUNDRAISER IN THE STATE AFTER
THE RALLY BUT HE MIGHT FACE SOME
SCRUTINY FOR HIS DECISIONS.
BACK THEN HE TWEETED ABOUT HOW
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNED
SAYING QUOTE WHILE HURRICANE
SANDY VICTIMS ACROSS NEW YORK
AND NEW JERSEY ARE STILL
DECIMATED BY SANDY, WRONG.
DAVE JOINS ME NOW FROM
WASHINGTON.
HE'S THE WORLD NEWS EDITOR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE
PRESIDENT HOLDING A RALLY IN THE
MIDDLE OF A DEVASTATING STORM
LIKE THIS?
>> THIS IS NOT A VISUAL THAT
MANY POLITICIANS WOULD OPT FOR.
ITS OBVIOUSLY A VERY POLITICAL
EVENT.
I THINK ITS MORE OF AN OPTICS
ISSUE THAT HE WILL SAY HIS TEAM
IS IN PLACE TO RESPOND TO THIS
STORM.
HE TENDS TO THINK IF YOU GET HIM
UP IN FRONT OF A CROWD GOOD
THINGS HAPPEN.
HE HAS DIFFERENT POLITICAL
CALCULUS THERE.
>> WHAT ABOUT FLORIDA GOVERNOR
RICK SCOTT?
HE HAS BEEN SERVICE BELIEVE
OTHER THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE
RUN UP TO THIS STORM MAKING
LANDFALL.
HE'S RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE
THIS NOVEMBER.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS
VARIOUS APPEARANCES AHEAD OF
THIS STORM AS IT -- WAS
APPROACHING THE STATE OF
FLORIDA.
>> SO TWO OF THE MOST CLOSELY
WATCHED RACES IN THE COUNTRY
RIGHT NOW ARE HAPPENING IN
FLORIDA.
YOU HAVE RICK SCOTT WHOSE THE
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.
HE'S BEEN ON TV ALMOST
CONSTANTLY THE LAST FEW DAYS.
THEN YOU HAVE GOT THE RACE TO
REPLACE RICK SCOTT AS GOVERNOR
AND ANDREW WHO IS THE MAJOR OF
TALLAHASSEE WHICH IS IN THE PATH
OF THIS STORM HAS ALSO BEEN ON
TV QUITE A BIT TALKING ABOUT HIS
PLANS TO RESPOND TO THE STORM.
YOU HAVE -- A REPUBLICAN IN ONE
RACE ON TV, YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT
IN THE OTHER RACE ON TV.
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH
OF THEM TO SHOW LEADERSHIP, TO
SHOW STRENGTH AND WE ARE ONLY A
FEW WEEKS AWAY NOW FROM RACES
THAT LOOK LIKE TOSS UPS.
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS ATTACKED
DEMOCRATS PLANS FOR HEALTH
DEPARTMENT CARE.
HE DID THIS WEDNESDAY IN A RARE
OP-ED FOR U.S. A TODAY.
HE GOES TON PLEAD WITH VOTERS TO
CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR
REPUBLICANS SAYING QUOTE, IF
DEMOCRATS WIN CONTROL OF
CONGRESS THIS NOVEMBER, WE WILL
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSER TO
SOCIALISM IN AMERICA.
HOW TYPICAL IS THAT RHETORIC
FROM A PRESIDENT WEEKS AWAY FROM
THE MIDTERMS?
>> ONE THING NOTE ABOUT THIS
OP-ED IS IT DOESN'T STAND UP TO
SCRUTINY FROM A FACTUAL
STANDPOINT.
THERE IS ALL SORTS OF FACT
CHECKS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.
THE FACTS ON THE -- DEMOCRATS
PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE ARE NOT UP
TO SNUFF.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS HEALTH
CARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ADS,
HEALTH CARE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT.
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLEARLY
SEEING THAT AND GETTING HIS
MESSAGE OUT IN WHAT YOU -- IT IS
A RARE THING FOR HIM TO WRITE AN
OP-ED.
>> SO THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING
MULTIPLE RALLIES THIS WEEK.
ON TUESDAY HE WAS IN IOWA.
LET'S LISTEN TO SOME OF WHAT HE
SAID.
>> A VOTE FOR US IS A VOTE FOR
LOWER TAXES, LESS REGULATION,
AND MORE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE
RIGHT HERE IN THE USA.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG
AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
>> ALL RIGHT, SO THE PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE THERE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY
CLEAR THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR
REPUBLICANS, THEY WILL HELP ME
IN WASHINGTON.
DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW
EFFECTIVE THAT PARTICULAR
STRATEGY MIGHT BE IN.
>> IT VARIES QUITE BIT.
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THESE
REPUBLICANS WHOSE RUNNING IN A
PRO-TRUMP DISTRICT BUT FACING A
TOUGH CHALLENGE, TRUMP COMING
INTO TOWN BOOSTING TURN UP,
TRYING TO CLOSE THAT ENTHUSIASM
GAP WITH DEMOCRATS IS A GOOD
THING.
THEN AGAIN TRUMP IS NOT THE MOST
POPULAR PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD.
IF YOU ARE RUNNING IN A DISTRICT
THAT'S REALLY A TOSS UP, HALF
REPUBLICAN, HALF DEMOCRATS, YOU
MIGHT WANT TO MAKE THIS RACE
MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU
THINK ARE GOOD FOR YOU.
THE ECONOMY, ABOUT TAXES, THE
TAX CUTS.
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT PRESIDENT
TRUMP COMING TO TOWN AND MAKING
THIS ALL ABOUT HIM AND INJECTING
EVEN MORE -- CONTROVERSY INTO
THINGS.
>> WELL, SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT
ERIC HOLDER WHO SAID THIS ON
WEDNESDAY.
QUOTE, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK
THEM.
WHEN WAS OF COURSE A PLAY ON
MICHELLE OBAMA'S NOW FAMOUS
QUOTE WHEN THEY GO LOW WE GO
HIGH.
THIS WAS FASCINATING TO ME
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORMER
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY
GENERAL -- SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE
TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
SAYING THIS, WHAT -- WHAT ARE
YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT ERIC HOLDER
SORT OF TAKING THIS APPROACH
úAHO
YOU THINK OTHER DEMOCRATS FEEL
ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR TACTIC?
>> WHEN I SAW THIS QUOTE POP UP
IN MY TWITTER FEED I HAD TO GO
AND FIND THE CLIP BECAUSE I WAS
SO SHOCKED BY THE QUOTE I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE
GETTING IT RIGHT.
THEY WERE GETTING IT RIGHT.
ERIC HOLDER DID SAY THIS.
THIS COMES AFTER HILLARY CLINTON
SAID THE TIME FOR CIVILITY IS
OVER.
WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE
MAJORITIES AND FIGHT, FIGHT.
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT
WHO IS SAYING THESE THINGS.
ITS PRETTY INCREDIBLE.
I GUESS IT SHOWS PEOPLE THINK
THE MORAL HIGH GROUND IS ONLY
WORTH SO MUCH.
THEY ARE TIRED OF LOSING.
HE'S BEEN SNIPING FROM THE
FRINGES AND SAYING WE NEED TO
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ON
THE BALLOT TAKE THAT MESSAGE
BECAUSE IF SO IT WILL BE AN EVEN
UGLIER POLITICAL CYCLE THAN WHAT
WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR.
>> WHAT ELSE ARE WE SEEING FROM
DEMOCRATS WHO ARE TRYING TO FIRE
UP THEIR BASE AS WE HAVE SEEN
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO FIRE UP
THEIR SIDE?
>> IT VARIES.
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO
ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT
TRUMP.
WE RAN STRICTLY AGAINST TRUMP
LAST TIME.
AND WE LOST.
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US,
WHAT WE STAND FOR.
THERE IS ALSO JUST SO MUCH ANGER
IN THE BASE.
PEOPLE ARE FURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AND
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.
PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT AS
WELL.
SO I THINK ITS GOING TO BE A
TEST FOR PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020.
ARE YOU GOING TO ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE THAT RUNS ANGRY OR ARE
YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE THAT RUNS WITH IDEAS?
>> LETS TURN TO ANOTHER ISSUE
HERE.
NIKKI HALEY RESIGNED TUESDAY AS
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. OR SHE
ANNOUNCED HER PLANS TO RESIGN.
SHE'S NOT LEAVING TILL THE END
OF THE YEAR.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN
POLICY?
>> WELL FIRST OF ALL HE HAS A
FIND A REPLACEMENT.
MY COLLEAGUES ARE REPORTING THAT
POWELL, SHE WAS THE DEPUTY
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, SHE
LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION.
SHE APPEARS TO BE THE FRONT
RUNNER IF SHE WANTS THE JOB.
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW NIKKI HALEY IS
AN INTERESTING CASE BECAUSE SHE
IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO
SERVED IN THIS ADMINISTRATION
AND CAME OUT WITH SORT OF HER
STAR BURNING BRIGHTER THAN WHEN
SHE CAME INTO THE
ADMINISTRATION.
SHE IS SOMEBODY WITH NATIONAL
AMBITIONS.
OBVIOUSLY THE PART OF WHAT
PEOPLE IN TRUMP WORLD WANTED TO
DO WAS DOWN THE IDEA THAT SHE
WAS GOING BE CHALLENGING
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
SHE DID THAT HERSELF.
SHE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON
THE BALLOT AT ANY LEVEL IN 2020.
I WILL SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT.
>> REALLY FASCINATING TO SEE
WHAT SHE WILL DO NEXT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
>>> FEMA IS ROUNDING UP TROOPS
TO SEND TO FLORIDA AND GEORGIA
IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE
MICHAEL.
KIERDING
MICHAEL -- THE RECENT INCREASE
IS PUTTING A STRAINS ON THE
AGENCY.
JEFF REPORTS FROM WASHINGTON.
>> AT FEMA HEAD QUARTERS A FEW
HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
COORDINATING THE RESPONSE TO
THIS DEVASTATING HURRICANE.
>> WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THAT
CONCERNS YOU THE MOST?
>> DOING WHAT THE FORECASTERS
WERE -- WERE PUSHING FORWARD.
I MEAN STORM SURGE, YOU SEEING
THE OCEAN RISE.
>> BROCK LONG SAID THE IMAGES --
>> POWER WILL BE OUT FOR WEEKS.
IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO PUT THIS
BACK TOGETHER.
>> SO THEY ARE REPORTING THAT
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
HURRICANES EVER TO HIT OUR
COUNTRY.
IS THAT A FACT?
>> WELL -- SO -- IN THIS AREA,
THIS WOULD BE THE MOST INTENSE
HURRICANE THAT'S STRUCK THIS
AREA SINCE 1851.
>> FEMA HAS ABOUT 3,000
EMPLOYEES IN THE FIELD PLUS
AIRCRAFT AND SEARCH AND RESCUE
TEAMS READY TO MOVE IN.
WITH MORE THAN 60 SEVERE STORMS
AND HURRICANES OVER THE LAST TWO
YEARS, FEMA IS UNDER
CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE.
>> IS FEMA STRETCHED THIN?
>> YES.
>> -- IT STARTS TO PUT STRESS
INSIDE AGENCY.
>> AND THAT IS MAGNIFIED BECAUSE
FIVE MONTHS INTO THE HURRICANE
SEASON SOME OF THE TOP JOBS AT
FEMA HAVE YET TO BE FILLED.
TODAY IN A BRIEFING
ADMINISTRATOR LONG EXPRESSED HIS
FRUSTRATION THAT HIS DEPUTY HAD
YET TO BE CONFIRMED EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS NOMINATED THIS PAST
SUMMER.
ELAINE.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING
HURRICANE MICHAEL HIT THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY.
NEARLY 30 MILLION PEOPLE WILL BE
IMPACTED BY THIS STORM.
MARK IS CHIEF OF TECHNOLOGY AND
SCIENCE AT THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER.
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM MIAMI.
LETS START WITH THE LATEST ON
MICHAEL.
WHERE IS IT NOW AND WHERE IS IT
HEADED?
>> ITS MOVED INTO SOUTHWEST
GEORGIA AND ITS GOING TO
CONTINUE ACROSS THE STATE OF
GEORGIA INTO SOUTH CAROLINA INTO
NORTH CAROLINA AND THEN OUT TO
SEA.
WE ARE STILL SEEING WINDS UP TO
ABOUT 100 MILES PER HOUR IN THIS
SMALL AREA NEAR THE CORE.
MICHAEL IS NOT DONE YET.
>> WHAT IS THE BIGGEST THREAT
GOING FORWARD?
>> RIGHT NOW THE THREAT IS STILL
GOING TO BE FROM WIND ALONG A
NARROW PATH ALONG THE CENTER.
THIS AREA OF GEORGIA IS HEAVILY
WOODED AND IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT
OF WIND IN THAT INLAND AREA
TO -- KNOCK DOWN TREES AND CAUSE
POWER OUTAGES.
WE STILL ANTICIPATE SOME WIND
DAMAGE ALONG THE WAY.
THAT IN COMBINATION WITH
RAINFALL TOTALS ALONG THE PATH.
>> IS IT UNUSUAL FOR A STORM TO
STAY THIS POWERFUL THIS FAR
INLAND?
>> NO, ACTUALLY THE GENERAL RULE
OF THUMB IT IS LOSES ITS SINCE
ENSTY IN TEN HOURS.
-- INTENSITY IN TEN HOURS
>> ITS NOT OVER YET IS THE
BOTTOM LINE.
>> UH-HUH.
>> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
BEFORE WE DO, WE WANT TO LET YOU
KNOW ABOUT EXCITING CHANGE
COMING TO CBSN.
BEGINNING ON MONDAY OCTOBER
15TH, WE ARE ADDING A NEW HOUR
OF LIVE COVERAGE TO OUR LINEUP.
BEGINNING AT 7:00 A.M.
EASTERN
AND MARIE GREEN AND VLADIMIR
WILL HELP YOU GET A HEAD START
ON YOUR DAY BY BRINGING YOU THE
LATEST NEWS FROM AROUND THE
WORLD WITH OUR GLOBAL TEAM OF
CORRESPONDENTS.
WE WILL ALSO DIG DEEP INTO THE
STORIES THAT MATTER MOST TO YOU.
DON'T MISS ANN MARIE AND VAD
MONDAY MORNING AT 7:00 EASTERN.
AS WE HAVE BEEN
REPORTING PANAMA CITY WAS IN THE
DIRECT PATH OF HURRICANE MICHAEL
WHEN IT MADE LANDFALL WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON.
ROOFS WERE RIPPED OFF AND TREES
WERE BLOWN DOWN.
DEBRIS WAS BLOWING IN ALL
DIRECTIONS.
CBS NEWS HILLARY LANE JOINS US
NOW FROM PANAMA CITY BEACH.
HILLARY WHAT ARE THE CURRENT
CONDITIONS WHERE YOU ARE?
>> ELAINE, IT IS LITERALLY THE
CALM AFTER THE STORM.
THERE IS STILL SOME RESIDUAL
WIND.
IT'S SO DIFFERENT RIGHT NOW.
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME OUTSIDE
DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE STORM
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO
DANGEROUS.
WE WATCHED FROM OUR HOTEL ROOM
AS THE WIND SNAPPED ACROSS THE
AREA.
THE TOOK TONS OF PALM TREES
DOWN.
MANY SIGNS AND -- COMPLETELY ON
THE GROUND AND WIRES AS WELL.
TAKING POWER OUT ALL OVER THE
AREA.
THE RAIN JUST COMING DOWN IN
BUCKETS.
>> AND SO THERE IS NO POWER
WHERE YOU RIGHT NOW?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
CLOSE TO 200,000 PEOPLE IN THIS
AREA ARE WITHOUT POWER.
WE LOST POWER ACTUALLY BEFORE
THE BRUBT, BEFORE THE EYE CAME
THROUGH THIS AREA.
NO WORD YET ON WHEN THE POWER
MIGHT COME ON.
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA HAS SAID
THE RESTORING POWER IS HIS
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.
>> HAVE YOU SEEN PEOPLE OUT AND
ABOUT AT ALL OR FIRST
RESPONDERS?
>> RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE STARTING
TO GET OUT AND SURVEY THE
DAMAGE.
THIS ROAD HAS BEEN VERY QUIET.
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE
DRIVE BY.
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING THE
GOVERNOR SAID THEY WOULD NOT BE
RESCUING PEOPLE.
NOW WE KNOW THOSE EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT SERVICE CREWS ARE OUT
IN THE COMMUNITY.
THEY ARE SURVEYING THE DAMAGE TO
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING
ON.
AS THEY ARE DOING THAT WE ARE
ALSO NOTICING RESIDENTS ARE
COMING OUT THE GET A SENSE OF
HOW IMPACTFUL THIS STORM WAS.
>> AND HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO
TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT HOW THIS
MIGHT COMPARE TO OTHER STORMS
THAT HAVE HIT THE AREA?
>> WE HAVE.
I THINK UNIVERSALLY THE ONE
THING PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS THIS
HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.
FOR SOMETHING LIKE MARIA OR IRMA
OR FLORENCE, IT WAS PREDICTED
ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE SO PEOPLE
HAD TIME TO PREPARE.
THIS HURRICANE FORMED SO QUICKLY
THAT BY THE TIME PEOPLE WERE
GETTING THE MANDATORY EVACUATION
ORDERS THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THERE
WAS A STORM AT ALL.
THERE WASN'T A LOT OF TIME FOR
THEM TO FIGURE OUT A PLAN, TO
BUY FOOD.
THAT'S THE THING THAT PEOPLE ARE
SAYING.
THEY ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW
INTENSE THIS STORM WAS BUT ALSO
HOW FAST IT WAS.
IT REALLY SURPRISED US TOO.
THIS STORM CAME IN WITH SUCH
INTENSITY BUT ALSO LEFT QUICKLY
>> I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STILL
TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON THE
SEVERITY OF THE DAMAGE THERE.
IS THERE ANY SENSE AT ALL FROM
FOLKS WHAT THEIR BIGGEST
CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE AS
THEY TRY TO RECOVER?
>> JUST LIKE EVERY STORM
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE IS SOMETHING
PEOPLE ARE VERY WORRIED ABOUT
WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH YOUR
FOUNDATION OR VERY EXPENSIVE
REPAIRS.
DOWNED POWER LINES AND TREES ARE
ALSO A CONCERN FOR PEOPLE.
TAKES DAYS SOMETIMES TO GET ALL
OF THAT BACK UP AND RUNNING
AGAIN.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> HISHG MICHAEL MAY --
HURRICANE MICHAEL MAY BE ON ITS
WAY OUT BUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
ARE STILL IN ITS PATH.
CRAIG WITH OUR MIAMI STATION IS
TRACKING THE STORM.
>> THE WIND FIELD IS STILL
RATHER LARGE.
NEAR THE CORE THE WINDS ARE VERY
STRONG.
DURING THE NIGHTTIME HOURS AND
THEN DURING THE DAY TOMORROW
MOVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE
CAROLINAS.
THEN OFF THE EAST COAST BY
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY
MORNING.
THE MAIN THING IS GOING TO BE
THOUGH IS GOING TO BE A
WIDESPREAD WIND FIELD THAT WILL
CONTINUE TO DO A LOT OF TREE
DAMAGE AND SO POWER OUTAGES ARE
TO BE EXPECTED FROM GEORGIA
THROUGH THE CAROLINAS.
MAYBE EVEN SOUTHEAST PARTS OF
VIRGINIA AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF
DELAWARE.
THE WINDS ARE GOING TO GRADUALLY
COME DOWN THE MOST INTENSE WINDS
BUT AS THE STORM MOVE ALONG THE
WIND FIELD SPREADS OUT A BIT
CAUSE THE STORM IS WEAKENING.
IN TERMS OF RAINFALL, ANOTHER
GOOD THING I SHOULD SAY THAT
THIS FAST MOVE -- MOVEMENT IS WE
ARE
NOT GOING TO SEE EXCESSIVE
AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL.
THERE IS ALSO THAT POSSIBILITY
OF TORNADOS ALONG AND TO THE
RIGHT OF THE TRACK.
IT COULD TO SOME LOCALIZED MORE
EXTREME AREAS OF DAMAGE.
THE GOOD NEWS ALSO IS WITH THIS
FAST MOVEMENT THE WEATHER WILL
BE IMPROVING FOR RESCUE AND
RECOVERY CREWS AS THE SYSTEM
ZIPS ON OUT OFF THE EAST COAST
BY FRIDAY.
>> THAT IS SOME GOOD NEWS.
THANK YOU.
>>> WE WANT TO TURN NOW TO
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE
AFFILIATE.
>> HE HEARD ALONG THOMASVILLE
ROAD THE STRETCH BY I-10 WHICH
IS RIGHT NEAR OUR STATION HAS
ABOUT A DOZEN POWER LINES JUST
THROWN, BROKEN THROUGHOUT THE
ROAD ON THOMASVILLE ROAD.
THAT IS ONE AREA THEY KNOW IS
PRETTY BAD OUT THERE.
AGAIN, ITS REALLY GOING TO BE
LOOKING OVER THE DAMAGE.
HERE'S A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD
TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
>> THIS CREATED WIDESPREAD
DAMAGE.
THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
WE HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE AS WE
SPEAK TO KNOW THAT THERE IS
WIDESPREAD DAMAGE ON OUR SYSTEM.
TO COMPARE IT TO HERMINE I THINK
IS A LITTLE EARLY.
WE HAVE MANY TREES DOWN.
WE HAVE BROKEN POLES IN OUR
SYSTEM.
WE KNOW WE HAVE DAMAGE TO OUR
TRANSMISSION SYSTEM.
>> SO AGAIN THE -- BULK OF THE
ACTION AS FAR AS ASSESSING THE
SYSTEM AND REALLY STARTING TO
BRING EVERYTHING BACK ONLINE
WILL START TOMORROW MORNING ONCE
DAYBREAK HITS.
THE CITY REALLY ASKING EVERY
BODY REPORT THEIR OUTAGES.
I KNOW LAST TIME I TALKED TO YOU
GUYS WE MENTIONED A LOT OF
PEOPLE TWEETING IN PICTURES OR
MESSAGING ON FACEBOOK TO THE
CITY.
THEY CAN SEE THOSE AND ADD THEM
BUT IT IS KIND OF AN EXTRA STEP
THERE.
IT TAKES A LITTLE LONG YOUR
REQUEST TO GET PUT IN.
IT WILL GO RIGHT THROUGH AND
MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE CREWS TO
FIND WHERE THOSE OUTAGES ARE AND
AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET TO THOSE
OUTAGES.
THAT IS THE LATEST HERE FROM THE
EMERGENCY OPERATION CENTER.
I WILL SEND IT BACK TO YOU GUYS
IN STUDIO.
>> THANK YOU.
AND IT MAKES ME THINK -- THEY
ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO
ASSESS TILL THE MORNING.
WHEN THE POWER IS OUT, IT GETS
REAL DARK OUT THERE.
>> IT DOES GET REAL DARK.
WE SAW THOSE TOWER CAM IMAGES OF
THE CITY OF TALLAHASSEE
BASICALLY BLANKETED IN DARKNESS.
>> IT JUST -- WE JUST TAKE ALL
THAT STUFF FOR GRANTED AND EVEN
DRIVING DOWN STREET AND THE LIT
UP BILLBOARDS AND THE -- THE LIT
UP BUSINESSES AND THE LIT UP
HOUSES AND -- IT GETS REALLY
DARK AND HARD TO NAVIGATE.
>> LOOK AT THIS.
THE VIEW WE SHOWED BEFORE WAS
THE VIEW FROM THE WCTV STUDIOS.
THIS IS THE VIEW LOOKING
DOWNTOWN.
YOU SEE WHATEVER THAT BUILDING
IS IN THE DISTANCE --
>> IS THAT THE STATE CAPITOL?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
THAT IS THE CAPITOL IS?
OKAY.
TOTAL DARKNESS ACROSS THIS CITY
TONIGHT.
A FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE.
YOU SEE HEAD LIGHTS SPORADICALLY
THROUGHOUT THE.
SOME PEOPLE THERE ON I-10.
>> THIS IS LOOKING SOUTH AND
WEST FROM WCTV.
THAT'S -- YOU LOOKING
TOWARDS DOWNTOWN THERE.
IF WE PAN -- NOW WE ARE LOOKING
MORE WEST ALONG I-10.
NORMALLY THERE ARE LIGHTS ALONG
THAT WHOLE STRETCH OF I-10 THERE
AND HERE -- WE ARE LOOKING AT --
NORTH ON THOMASVILLE ROAD AND --
ALL THOSE NORMAL BUSINESSES --
THIS WOULD BE LIKE THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND -- MCCLAY AND
ITS ALL -- ITS ALL IN DARKNESS
RIGHT NOW.
>> I THINK SHE ESTIMATED 70,000
PEOPLE IN THE CITY WITHOUT POWER
AND ACROSS OUR REGION BETWEEN
160 AND 200,000 PEOPLE IN THE
DARK TONIGHT.
MANY OF YOU MAY BE WATCHING THIS
ON OUR -- ON OUR WEBSITE, ON
YOUR MOBILE PHONE TONIGHT.
WE ARE THANKFUL WE ARE STILL
CONNECTED.
WE WISH YOU LUCK IN GETTING
POWER RESTORED EVENTUALLY.
>> MIKE STANDING BY AGAIN FOR
US.
THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY POWERFUL
IMAGES, HUH MIKE?
>> THEY ER.
I WILL GET ON MY LITTLE SOAPBOX
TOO THAT -- THERE IS NOT A LOT
OF TRAFFIC OUT THERE BUT DON'T
FORGET EVEN THOUGH TRAFFIC LIGHT
IS OUT, YOU GOT TO TREAT IT AS
FOUR WAY STOP.
THE GUY COMING FROM THE SIDE
DIRECTION MIGHT THINK THE SAME
THING THAT HE CAN GO BLOWING
THROUGH IT.
IF YOU COME UP TO A TRAFFIC
LIGHT AND IF YOU SEE --
>> WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING
COVERAGE FROM OUR TALLAHASSEE
AFFILIATE ON HURRICANE MICHAEL.
MUCH MORE ON THE STORM
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING.
RIGHT NOW A QUICK BREAK.
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
HI EVERYONE.
AT LEAST ONE PERSON IS CONFIRMED
DEAD AFTER HURRICANE MICHAEL
SLAMMED THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.
THE HISTORIC CATEGORY 4 STORM
MADE LANDFALL WITH TOP SUSTAINED
WINDS OF 155 MILES PER HOUR.
MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A MILLION
CUSTOMERS IN FLORIDA ARE WITHOUT
POWER.
WE ARE SEEING PICTURES OF
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE AND
FLOODING.
SOME AREAS SAW 10 FEET OF STORM
SURGE.
THE HURRICANE HAS SLOWED A BIT
BUT IS STILL DELIVERING A HEAVY
WHETHER OR NOT E- --
BLOW.
JOINING ME NOW FOR THE LATEST IS
CBS NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER DAVID
PARKINSON.
WHAT IS THE VERY LATEST?
>> THE VERY LATEST IS WE JUST
GOT AN ADVISORY.
WE ARE DOWN NOW TO 90.
THE STORM IS SERIOUSLY WEAKENING
AND THAT IS A REALLY GOOD THING.
THAT BEING SAID, YOU STILL NEED
TO WATCH OUT FOR THE HEAVY RAIN.
YOU STILL NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR
THE STRONG WIND AND WIND GUSTS
THAT CAN BRING DOWN POWER LINES.
ALSO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT YOU
HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF STORM SURGE
THREAT RIGHT ALONG THE COAST OF
THE ATLANTIC BY CHARLESTON AND
SAVANNAH.
WHAT WAS SURPRISING WE -- IT
SHOULD BE STARTING TO FALL
APART.
YOU LOSING THAT TYPICAL SORT OF
DONUT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN THE
CENTER.
ITS AMAZING HOW QUICKLY IT SPUN
UP.
WE GAINED 55 MILES AN HOUR IN
ABOUT 30 HOURS.
THE REASON FOR THAT WAS BECAUSE
THERE WAS JUST NOTHING STOPPING
IT.
HAD WARM WATER, THE DRY AIR
DIDN'T MAKE IT IN WHERE AS NOW
ITS INTERACTING WITH LAND.
YOU HAVE THE FRICTION OF LAND
AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSES IT TO
WEAKEN.
THERE IS NO FUEL SOURCE.
THERE IS NO WATER AND THAT'S --
THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT A STORM WITH WINDS
ANY STRONGER THAN THEY HAVE TO
GOING THROUGH PLACES IN UP LAND
SOUTH CAROLINA AND NORTH
CAROLINA WHERE YOU HAVE
ELEVATION.
YOU COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE
MUDSLIDES, BRINGING THINGS DOWN
WHEN YOU HAVE WINDS OF THAT
SPEED AS WELL.
>> SO I MEAN THERE IS NO CHANCE
THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN AGAIN AT
THIS POINT.
>> IT CAN STRENGTHEN AGAIN ONCE
IT GETS BACK OVER WATER WHICH IS
GOING TO DO PROBABLY OVER THE
CHESAPEAKE AREA AND THAT WOULD
BE FRIDAY MORNING.
OVER LAND, NO.
IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO
WEAKEN.
THEY EXPECT IT TO BE A TROPICAL
STORM BY THE TIME WE GET TO 2:00
A.M.
ON THURSDAY.
I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY BE DOWN
THERE BEFORE THAT POINT BUT ITS
MOVING SO QUICKLY IT WILL
MAINTAIN AT LEAST A DECENT
AMOUNT OF STRENGTH AS IT MOVES
INLAND FOR A WHILE.
>> WHAT ABOUT RAIN FOR PEOPLE IN
THE PATH OF THIS STORM STILL
WHAT DO THEY NEED TO BE ON THE
LOOK OUT FOR?
>> THE RAIN NUMBERS HAVE COME
DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
THERE'S A POTENTIAL FOR 4-8
INCHES WHERE YOU SEE THAT ORANGE
AREA THAT IS RIGHT ALONG THE
SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA BORDER.
IN ADDITION INTO NORTH CAROLINA,
UP INTO RALEIGH, THAT AREA COULD
BE SEEING 3-6 INCHES OF RAIN.
THE GOOD NEWS IS AS WE GET TO
THE COAST, YOU ARE PROBABLY
LOOKING AT ONLY 1-3 INCHES
MAYBE.
THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
THE BAD NEWS IS ALL OF THAT
WESTERN RAIN HAS TO GET INTO THE
RIVERS.
THEY WILL RISE FOR A SHORT
PERIOD OF TIME FRIDAY INTO THE
WEEKEND.
THAT'S THE NEXT BIG CONCERN
INCLUDING SOME RIVERS THAT SAW
SOME FLOODING THAT WAS QUITE --
SERIOUS LIKE THE PEE DEE IN
SOUTH CAROLINA OUT OF FLORENCE.
>> AND REMIND US AGAIN OF THE
PATH WE SHOW THAT GRAPHIC THAT
HAD THE TRAJECTORY OF WHERE THE
STORM IS HEADING NEXT.
>> SO GEORGIA INTO SOUTH
CAROLINA INTO CENTRAL SOUTH
CAROLINA INTO CENTRAL NORTH
CAROLINA INTO VIRGINIA EXITING
JUST NORTH OF NORFOLK AND THEN
THOUGH THE STORM IS OFFSHORE,
NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY, THAT AREA
FROM BOSTON DOWN THROUGH NEW
YORK INTO PHILLY, THERE IS A
FLASH FLOOD WATCH BECAUSE ENOUGH
OF THE RAIN ON THE LEFT HAND
SIDE OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE
COMING THROUGH ON FRIDAY.
YOU WILL HAVE SOME FLIGHT
PROBLEMS OUT OF THAT AS WELL.
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NEED STORM
TO BE MOVING OVER YOU.
THE KEY THING TAKE AWAY HERE IS
LEFT OF CENTER, WHICH IS UNUSUAL
A LITTLE BIT.
THAT'S WHERE YOU WILL BE SEEING
SOME OF THE MOST RAIN AS THIS
MOVES THROUGH.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT AREAS
IS PANAMA CITY BEACH JUST WEST
OF WHERE MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL.
MERE -- HERE SOME OF THE DAMAGE
THE
WINDS DID THERE.
CBS EVENING NEWS ANCHOR IS THERE
WITH MORE.
>> THE SOUND UNMISTAKABLE,
MORE LIKE A JET LINER AT TAKE
OFF.
>> OH MY GOD.
>> HERE IN PANAMA CITY BEACH WE
WERE NEAR THE CENTER OF THE
STORM AS IT BLASTED AWAY.
>> WHERE YOU NOW APPROACHING THE
WORST OF HURRICANE MICHAEL.
THE PALM BEACH CITY MANAGER
TELLS US HE THINKS ABOUT 50% OF
RESIDENTS HAVE LEFT TOWN.
AT THIS POINT THEY ARE NO LONGER
RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS.
IF SOMEONE HAS A
LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY, THEY
LIKELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET
THERE.
>> WHEN MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL
ITS WINDS TOPPED OUT AT 155
MILES AN HOUR.
THAT IS JUST 2 MILES SHORT OF
CATEGORY 5.
GUSTS MAY HAVE CLOCKED IN
HIGHER.
MANY WIND GAUGES BROKE.
>> THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
RIGHT UP AGAINST ALL WINDOWS.
>> IT WAS ENOUGH TO RIP ROOFTOPS
OFF BUILDINGS.
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE INSIDE THE
HOTEL WITH FLASHLIGHTS.
WE ARE TRYING TO GET BACK
OUTSIDE WHENEVER ITS SAFE TO
ASSESS THE DAMAGE.
>> JUST A FEW MILES TO THE EAST
OF PANAMA CITY BEACH LIES THE
TOURIST TOWN OF MEXICO BEACH.
WHICH TOOK A DIRECT HIT.
MICHAEL APPEARED TO FLATTEN
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.
STORM SUMMERS UP TO 8 FEET AND
RAINFALL TOPPING 5 INCHES
SUBMERGED MANY HOUSES THERE.
OTHER BUILDINGS LAY IN PILES.
MICHAEL IS THE LOWEST PRESSURE
HURRICANE TO STRIKE THE U.S.
MAINLAND SINCE 1969.
NOTHING THIS FEROCIOUS HAS EVER
HIT THE PANHANDLE.
>> JUST EAST IS PORT SAINT JOE
FLORIDA.
THE AREA IS ALREADY SEEING HEAVY
FLOODING.
OMAR HAS THE LATEST.
>> HURRICANE MICHAEL SLAMMED
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON.
HEAVY RAINS AND TREE SNAPPING
WINDS PUMMELLED THE FLORIDA
PANHANDLE.
>> WHOA.
>> THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ROAD OUT
THE STORM AT HOME DESPITE BEING
TOLD TO GET OUT.
>> PORT SAINT JOE RESIDENTS WENT
INTO RESCUE MODE AFTER MICHAEL'S
12 FOOT STORM SURGE TRAPPED
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES.
VOLUNTEERS AND SMALL BOATS AND
BIG TRUCKS PUSHED THROUGH
STREETS BLOCKED BY TREES AND
SUBMERGED IN SEVERAL FEET OF
WATER.
DONNA DIDN'T HAVE A WAY TO CHECK
ON HER FAMILY SO SHE USED OUR
CELLPHONE TO TELL HER TRAPPED
NEPHEW THAT HELP WAS ON THE WAY.
>> WITHIN MINUTES A DRIVER IN A
BIG PICKUP TRUCK PULLED UP TO
THE WATERLOGGED HOUSE AND
CARRIED JEFF PITS AND HIS DOG
BUDDY TO HIGHER GROUND.
>> HOW WAS THE WATER LEVELS?
>> GOT UP TO 4 FEET IN THE
HOUSE.
>> IN THE HOUSE?
>> IN THE HOUSE UP TO ABOUT MY
HIP.
>> THE DRIVER WAS A MAN NAMED
CHRIS.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TALK AS
HE DROVE BACK TO HELP MORE
PEOPLE.
HIS ACTIONS SAID PLENTY IN THIS
SMALL COMMUNITY.
>> WHERE IS ANYBODY WITHOUT
FRIENDS?
>> EVEN AS THE STORM WAS PASSING
OVER HEAD VOLUNTEERS CAME OUT
WITH CHAIN SAWS WORKING TO CLEAR
THE STREETS OF DOWNED TREES.
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY
HURRICANE FORCED WINDS DAMAGED
BUILDINGS AND EVEN THE FLIPPED
OVER THIS RV.
AS PEOPLE ASSESS THE DAMAGE,
DONNA IS JUST THANKFUL SHE
SURVIVED ONE OF THE BIGGEST
HURRICANES TO HIT THE FLORIDA
PANHANDLE.
>> HOW WAS IT TO SEE HIM ON THE
BACK OF THE TRUCK?
>> IT WAS GOOD, GOOD.
WE CAN REST EASY NOW.
>> OMAR JOINS ME NOW FROM PORT
SAINT JO FLORIDA.
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT CONDITIONS
WHERE YOU ARE?
>> AS YOU CAN SEE IT IS STILL
VERY WINDY.
THE WIND IS COMING THROUGH AT A
GOOD CLIP HERE.
IT WILL COME UP AND THEN IT WILL
DIE DOWN A LITTLE BIT.
WE ARE STILL GETTING SOME STEADY
GUSTS.
THE RAIN HAS REALLY STOPPED IN
THIS AREA.
SOME OF THE FLOODING, SOME OF
THE STORM SURGE WE SAW EARLIER
IS STARTING TO RECEDE A LITTLE
BIT.
THE BIG ISSUE IS GOING TO BE OF
COURSE CLEAN UP.
THAT WILL BE A LONG TERM THING.
WE HAVE TREES DOWN.
WE HAVE SEEN PIECES OFFENSE --
OF
FENCE THAT ARE STREWN ABOUT THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.
THAT WILL BE PART OF THE LONG
TERM PROCESS ABOUT THE CLEAN UP.
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO SHOW
YOU OVER HERE, THE PANHANDLE HAS
A LOT OF THESE BEAUTIFUL PINE
TREES.
THEY ARE TALL AND STRAIGHT.
GREAT DURING THE SUMMER.
WHEN ITS HURRICANE TIME, THEY
WILL SNAP IN HALF AND BRING DOWN
ALL THE POWER LINES.
THAT ONE IS PROBABLY MAYBE 50,
60 FEET BUT ITS SNAPPED RIGHT IN
THE CENTER.
A LOT OF THOSE ARE BLOCKING THE
ROADS.
THAT WILL BE A MAJOR PART OF THE
CLEAN UP HERE.
>> TELL US, WE SAW IN YOUR PIECE
PRIVATE CITIZENS, WHAT ABOUT
FIRST RESTER PONDERS --
RESPONDERS?
>> WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM
TRICKLE OUT.
THEY TOLD US THAT THE HOSPITALS
ARE CLOSED.
ALL THE AMBULANCES ARE FARTHER
INLAND.
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL HELP IT
ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN TILL AFTER
THE STORM.
WE DID SEE SOME POLICE.
THEY HAD ONE OF THESE REAL HIGH
VEHICLES.
THEY WENT INTO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT IS BEHIND ME HERE.
SOME OF THESE HOMES WERE UNDER 4
FEET OF WATER.
WE WERE SEEING THEM DRIVE TO
THOSE AREAS.
WE SAW THEM PULL OUT AN ELDERLY
COUPLE.
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM.
THE BIG THING PEOPLE WANT TO
SEE, THEY WANT TO SEE THE POWER
E CREWS AND THOSE CHERRY PICKERS
BECAUSE THAT MEANS PROGRESS
SOON.
>> AND IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO
TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW THIS
STORM COMPARES TO OTHERS MIGHT
HAVE HIT THE AREA.
>> THERE IS SOME PEOPLE THAT
SAID THEY REALLY CAN'T COMPARE
IT.
THERE WAS HERMINE IN 2016.
THERE WAS WIND THAT WAS A RAIN
EVENT.
TO HAVE A CATEGORY 4 JUST
BARRELLING TOWARDS THE
PENINSULA, IT HAS BEEN DECADES
SINCE ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAS
EVER BEEN THOUGHT OF IN THAT
AREA.
FOR SOME REASON IT ALWAYS TURNS
OFF.
FOR HERE IN THIS AREA, PEOPLE
WERE LISTENING.
A LOT OF PEOPLE EVACUATED.
THY WENT FARTHER INLAND.
IN PORT SAINT JO THERE IS ABOUT
3500 PEOPLE AND THE SHERIFF
DEPARTMENT WAS TELLING US ABOUT
60% STAYED.
THEY STAYED IN THE AREA AND
DECIDED TO RIDE IT OUT.
WE ARE TRYING TO SEE IF THOSE
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME BACK.
THEY ARE COMING TO CHECK ON
THEIR PROPERTY, ON THEIR
BUSINESSES AND THEY ARE HAVING
TO DO THAT FIRST ASSESSMENT
WHICH SOMETIMES CAN BE SHOCKING.
>> YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE ON THE
LOOK OUT FOR THOSE POWER CREWS.
WHAT TO YOU THINK SOME OF THE
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE FOR
PEOPLE AS THEY ATTEMPT TO TRY TO
RECOVER?
YOU DON'T HAVE POWER, YOU DON'T
HAVE AIR CONDITIONING.
IMAGINE ITS PRETTY WARM.
>> IT IS.
THERE IS SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE
GOOD PREPPERS AND THEY HAVE
GENERATORS READY TO GO.
THEY WERE MAYBE CHARGING THEIR
PHONES AND WHAT NOT IN CARS.
THERE IS NO CELL SIGNAL RIGHT
NOW HERE.
PRETTY MUCH DEAD IN THE AREA.
THE BIG CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE
FOR THE POWER CREWS THEY WILL
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN
ROADS.
WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE CHAIN
SAW CREWS COME OUT FIRST, START
CLEARING SOME OF THE ROADS.
VOLUNTEERS HAVE STARTED DOING IT
AS WELL.
HOPEFULLY THEY KNOW -- IT WILL
BE SEVERAL DAYS.
THEY ARE HOPING ITS NOT SEVERAL
WEEKS BEFORE THEY GET POWER.
>> THANK YOU.
COMING UP, WE WILL HAVE MORE ON
THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SEEKING
SHELTER DUE TO HURRICANE
MICHAEL.
THE MOST POWERFUL STORM TO HIT
THE U.S. MAINLAND IN NEARLY 50
YEARS.
>>> PLUS LAWMAKERS ARE CALLING
FOR ANSWERS ABOUT A SAUDI
JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN MISSING
FOR MORE THAN WEEK.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE'S
LOOKING INTO WHAT HAPPENED.
THIS IS CBSN.
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON.
THE DOW JONES
PLUNGED MORE THAN 800 POINTS
WEDNESDAY.
ITS WORST DROP IN EIGHT MONTHS.
WHILE THE S&P 500 SANK.
MARTIN IS LONDON
BUREAU CHIEF AND HE JOINS ME
NOW.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE.
WERE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE SUCH A
LARGE DROP TODAY?
>> I REALLY WAS.
WE WERE LOOKING AT THE START OF
THE TRADING KAND OF -- KIND OF
IN
AND OUT OF POSITIVE TERRITORY.
WE SAW THE SHARP DECLINES.
YOU MENTION -- THE NASDAQ HAD
ITS WORST DAY THIS SEVEN YEARS
TO DAY.
>> SO WHY IS THAT?
WHY DOES SOME TECH STOCKS SUFFER
SUCH BIG HITS?
>> THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO
RISING INTEREST RATES.
INVESTORS WILL TAKE SOME OF
THE MONEY OUT OF THE MARKET AS A
RESULT.
PUT IT INTO CONTEXT AS WELL AND
THAT TECH HAS LED THE GAINS FOR
MOST OF THE YEAR.
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT
TAKING AS WE HEAD TO THE FINAL
MONTHS.
IF YOU HAVE BEEN SITTING ON A
25% GAIN, YOU DON'T MIND LOSING
2 OR 3% TODAY AND MAYBE JUST SIT
IT OUT TILL CHRISTMAS.
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER
FACTORS?
>> THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IT TO
DAY WHEN WE WAS CRITICAL OF THE
FEDERAL RESERVE.
HE THINKS THEY ARE MOVING A
LITTLE TOO FAST.
THERE ARE SOME WHO AGREE AND
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DON'T.
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS RUNNING AT
THE FASTEST PACE IN MORE THAN
FIVE YEARS.
UB.
WE ARE LEANING A LITTLE EVERY
WEEK.
INFLATION IS PRETTY TAME.
THE FED IS MOVING MORE QUICKLY
FOR SOME AND MAYBE NOT AS QUICK
FOR OTHERS.
>> WELL LET ME ASK YOU, THIS DOW
IS STILL AT A RECORD LEVEL.
OVERALL, IS THIS JUST A BLIP?
IS THIS A MOMENTARY BLIP ON THE
RADAR SCREEN?
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL
ECONOMIC HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY,
HOW DOES THAT PICTURE LOOK?
>> I THINK ITS STILL DOING
TERRIBLY WELL.
ONE OF THE BEST PACES IN FIVE
YEARS.
THAT'S REALLY HEALTHY
EARNINGS AND REALLY DOES
ILLUSTRATE SOME OF THE THINGS
THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.
NOW WHAT INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT IS WHAT HAPPENS IN 2019
WHEN THE IMPACT OF TAX CUTS
STARTS TO FADE AWAY.
PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANTLY WHAT
IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE ON
GOING TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN
WASHINGTON AND BEIJING AND THE
TARIFFS THAT ARE PILING UP?
AT THE MOMENT THEY SIT AT $250
BILLION.
THEY COULD RISE TO $500 BILLION
BY THE END OF THE YEAR.
THAT COULD HAVE A REALLY
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CONSUMER
SPENDING AND THEN HAVE A
CASCADING EFFECT INTO STOCKS AND
EVERYTHING ELSE.
WE MAY NOT KNOW THE TRUE STORY
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW.
>> HOW QUICKLY CAN CAN MARKET
REBOUND FROM WHAT WE HAVE JUST
SEEN?
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD
EXPECT RELATIVELY QUICKLY WILL
CORRECT ITSELF?
>> IT'S A GREAT QUESTION.
I THINK WE ARE ALL GOING TO BE
FASCINATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS
OVERNIGHT IN THE ASIAN MARKETS.
IF IT FOLLOWS SUIT WE COULD SEE
MORE SELLING FRIDAY -- THURSDAY
AND THEN POTENTIALLY INTO
FRIDAY.
WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN
IS WITH THE BANK EARNINGS
BEGINNING ON FRIDAY AND THEN THE
LARGER CORPORATE EARNINGS
STARTING NEXT WEEK WE WILL START
TO SEE SOME OF THOSE GOOD
NUMBERS.
THEN WE COULD POTENTIALLY STEADY
THE SHIP.
I STILL THINK THE MARKET IS GOOD
TILL THE END OF THE YEAR.
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL HEALTHY
CORRECTION.
--
>> SO IF YOU ARE AN INVESTOR
RIGHT NOW AND YOU ARE FEELING A
LITTLE NERVOUS, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?
>> I'D SAY DON'T WORRY.
IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN THE
MARKET, AND THE FUNDMENTALS OF
THE COMPANIES YOU OWN, YOU HAVE
A CHANCE TO BUY THEM MORE
úCHEAP.
IF YOU ARE WILLING TO BE PATIENT
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS YOU COULD
MAKE A LITTLE MORE MONEY.
IF YOU SEEN THE VALUE OF YOUR
401(K) DECLINE A LITTLE BIT,
DON'T BE TERRIBLY CONCERNED.
PAY VERY CLOSE TO ATTENTION TO
RISING INTEREST RATES.
THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN EXCELLENT
INDICATION OF WHAT TO DO NEXT
AND THEN WATCH CORPORATE
EARNINGS IN THE WEEKS AHEAD.
THOSE COLLECTIVELY WILL GIVE YOU
THE KIND OF PICTURE YOU ARE
GOING TO NEED.
DON'T FORGET, THE UNDERLYING
FUNT FUNDAMENTALS ARE STILL VERY
GOOD.
THEY ARE BE ABLE TO SPEND.
SPENDING DRIVES TWO-THIRDS OF
THIS ECONOMY.
THOSE SIMPLE EQUATIONS STILL
VERY GOOD.
I REALLY DO BELIEVE WE WILL
PROBABLY BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS.

THE STORM MADE LAND FALL AS THE
STRONGEST STORM TO HIT THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY AND
WAS THE THIRD STRONGEST
HURRICANE TO EVER HIT THE
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES WITH
WIND SPEEDS TOPPING 155 MILES
PER HOUR.
ROOFS WERE RIPPED OFF OF
BUILDING AND POWER WAS KNOCKED
OUT FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE.
RESIDENTS OF BRISTOL FLORIDA
HAVE PACKED LOCAL SHELTERS AS
HURRICANE MICHAEL PASSES
THROUGH.
CBS NEWS'S NICK YI -- NICKY

DAY WITH SOME RESIDENTS.

BRISTOL WHICH IS SERVING AS A
SHELTER TO MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE.
WE ARE ALSO TOLD A TORNADO HAS
ALSO HIT THIS AREA.
WE CAN HEAR AND FEEL THE WIND
AND RAIN SHAKING THE DOORS IN
THE SCHOOL HERE.
THE TREES LINING THE SCHOOL
OUTSIDE HAVE SPLIT IN HALF.
WE WERE JUST TOLD BY A LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHO HAD
CHECKED THE AREA THAT IT LOOKS
LIKE THE APOCALYPSE HIT THE
AREA.
HE SAID THERE ARE ROOFS FROM
HOMES LYING IN THE STREETS.
THE FLORIDIANS HERE WITH US IN
THE SHELTER HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY
UNITED EVEN EMOTIONAL AT POINTS.
SOME PEOPLE PRAYING OUT LOUD.
ONE MAN JUST WALKED IN NOT LONG
AGO AFTER THE HURRICANE HIT AND
SAID I JUST LOST MY HOME.
WE ARE ALSO HEARING ENTIRE
STREETS IN THIS AREA HAVE BEEN
WIPED OUT.
NOW COMES MORE WAITING.
PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD TO STAY
PUT HERE.
THEY ARE WAITING TO HEAR WHEN
ITS SAFE FOR THEM TO GO HOME AND
MANY ARE HOPING TO HEAR FROM
FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO STAYED
BEHIND.
AND THAT THEY ARE SAFE.
>> THAT WAS NICKY REPORTING FROM
BRISTOL, FLORIDA.
>>> COMING UP, THE HEAD OF FEMA
ISSUED A STRONG WARNING TO
PEOPLE STAYING BEHIND IN
EVACUATION ZONES RIDING OUT
HURRICANE MICHAEL WILL PUT
OTHERS IN DANGER.
WE WILL HAVE MORE ON FEMA'S
STORM RESPONSE.
>>> PLUS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
TRASHING DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR
MEDICARE FOR ALL AS HE LOOKS TO
PAINT THEM AS EXTREME AHEAD OF
THE MIDTERMS.
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
WHILE HURRICANE
MICHAEL PUMMELLED THE
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES THE
PRESIDENT KEPT DRY UP NORTH.
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE IN ERIE,
PENNSYLVANIA, AFTER HIS CAMPAIGN
STOP FOR MULTIPLE REPUBLICANS
AHEAD OF THE MIDTERMS.
HE THEN ATTENDED A FUNDRAISER IN
THE STATE.
WE ARE GETTING A LOOK AT THE
AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE MICHAEL.
THIS IS MEXICO BEACH, FLORIDA.
THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINED HIS
REASONING FOR GOING FOR
PENNSYLVANIA DESPITE THE
DANGEROUS STORM IMPACTING MANY
AMERICANS.
IN A TWEET WEDNESDAY HE SAID HE
DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT THE
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ATTENDING.
HUH MIGHT FACE SOME SCRUTINY FOR
HIS DECISIONS.
MUCH LIKE THE CRITICISM HE GAVE
PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THE 2012
ELECTION AFTER HURRICANE SANDY.
BACK THEN HE TWEETED ABOUT HOW
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNED QUOTE
WHILE HURRICANE SANDY VICTIMS
ACROSS NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY
ARE STILL DECEMBER DESIGNATED BY
SANDY.
DAVE -- DESIGNATED BY SANDY.
DAVE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE
PRESIDENT HOLDING A RALLY IN THE
MIDDLE OF -- DEVASTATING STORM
LIKE THIS?
>> THIS IS NOT A VISUAL THAT
MANY POLL -- POLITICIANS WOULD
OPT
FOR.
ITS OBVIOUSLY A VERY POLITICAL
EVENT.
I THINK ITS MORE OF AN OPTICS
ISSUE THAT -- HE WILL SAY HIS
TEAM IS IN PLACE TO RESPOND TO
THIS STORM.
HE TENDS TO THINK IF YOU GET HIM
UP IN FRONT OF A CROWD, GOOD
THINGS HAPPEN.
>> WHAT ABOUT FLORIDA GOVERNOR
RICK SCOTT?
HE HAS BEEN SERVICE BELIEVE OVER
THE LAST FEW DAYS IN THE RUN UP
TO THE STORM MAKING LANDFALL.
HE IS RUNNING FOR THE U.S.
ENATE THIS NOVEMBER.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS
VARIOUS APPEARANCES AHEAD OF
THIS STORM AS IT WAS APPROACHING
THE STATE OF FLORIDA.
>>.
>> YOU HAVE RICK SCOTT WHO IS
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.
HE HAS BEEN ON TV ALMOST
CONSTANTLY THE LAST FEW DAYS.
THEN YOU HAVE THE RACE TO
REPLACE RICK SCOTT AS GOVERNOR
IN ANDREW WHO IS THE MAYOR OF
TALLAHASSEE WHICH IS IN THE PATH
OF THIS STORM.
HAS ALSO BEEN ON TV QUITE A BIT
TALKING ABOUT HIS PLANS TO
RESPOND TO THE
STORM.
THIS SAN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH OF
THEM TO SHOW LEADERSHIP, TO SHOW
STRENGTH AND WE ARE ONLY A FEW
WEEKS AWAY NOW FROM RACES THAT
LOOK LIKE TOSS UPS.
>> RIGHT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS ATTACKED
DEMOCRATS PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE.
HE DID THIS WEDNESDAY IN A RARE
OP-ED FOR U.S. A TODAY.
HE GOES TON PLEAD WITH VOTERS TO
CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR
REPUBLICANS SAYING QUOTE IF
DEMOCRATS WIN CONTROL OF THE
CONGRESS THIS NOVEMBER WE WILL
COME DANGEROUSLY CLOSER TO
SOCIALISM IN AMERICA.
HOW TYPICAL IS THAT RHETORIC
FROM A PRESIDENT WEEKS AWAY FROM
THE MIDTERMS?
>> ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT THIS
OP-ED IS IT REALLY DOESN'T STAND
UP TO SCRUTINY FROM A FACTUAL
STANDPOINT.
THERE IS ALL SORTS OF FACT
CHECKS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.
THE FACTS ON THE TELL CATS PLANS
FOR HEALTH CARE HAVE NOT UP TO
SNUFF.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT
HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
ADS ACROSS ALL THE MIDTERM RACES
IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, HEALTH
CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN
THEIR ADS.
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT.
REPUBLICANS ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE
A LITTLE BIT.
THEY MIGHT THINK THIS IS A
BETTER ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLEARLY
SEEING THAT AND GETTING HIS
MESSAGE OUT IN WHAT YOU ARE --
IT IS A RARE THING FOR HIM TO
WRITE AN OP-ED.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING
MULTIPLE RALLIES THIS WEEK.
LETS LISTEN TO SOME OF WHAT HE
SAID.
>> A VOTE FOR US A WIN FOR LOWER
TAXES, LESS REGULATION, AND MORE
PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE RIGHT
HERE USA.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG
AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN!
>> ALL RIGHT SO THE PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE THERE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY
CLEAR THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR
REPUBLICANS, THEY WILL HELP ME
IN WASHINGTON.
>> IT VARIES QUITE A BIT RACE TO
RACE.
IF YOU WITH ONE OF THOSE
REPUBLICANS WHO IS RUNNING IN A
PRO-TRUMP DISTRICT BUT FACING A
TOUGH CHALLENGE, TRUMP COMING
INTO TOWN BOOSTING TURN IS UP A
GOOD THING.
THEN AGAIN TRUMP IS NOT THE MOST
POPULAR PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD.
IF YOU ARE RUNNING IN A DISTRICT
THAT IS REALLY A TOSS UP, HALF
REPUBLICAN, HALF DEMOCRAT ROW --
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT PRESIDENT
TRUMP COMING TO TOWN AND MAKING
THIS ALL ABOUT HIM AND INJECTING
EVEN MORE -- CONTROVERSY INTO
THINGS.
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ERIC
HOLDER WHO SAID THIS ON
WEDNESDAY.
QUOTE, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK
THEM.
WHICH WAS OF COURSE A PLAY ON
MICHELLE OBAMA'S NOW FAMOUS
QUOTE WHEN THEY GO LOW WE GO
HIGH.
THIS WAS FASCINATING TO ME
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORMER
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL,
SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE TOP LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SAYING
THIS.
WHAT -- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
ABOUT ERIC HOLDER SORT OF TAKING
THIS APPROACH OF AHEAD OF
NOVEMBER?
>> WHEN I SAW THIS QUOTE POP UP
IN MY TWITTER FEED I HAD TO GO
AND FIND CLIP BECAUSE I WAS SO
SHOCKED BY THE QUOTE I WANTED TO
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WERE
GETTING IT RIGHT.
THEY WERE GETTING IT RIGHT.
ERIC HOLDER DID SAY THIS.
THIS IS -- COMES AFTER HILLARY
CLINTON SAID AT THAT THE TIME
FOR CIVILITY IS OVER.
WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE
MAJORITIES AND FIGHT, FIGHT,
FIGHT AND THEN THERE CAN BE TIME
FOR CIVILITY.
THESE AREN'T PEOPLE THAT ARE
COMING FROM THE OUTSIDE AND
SAYING THE ESTABLISHMENT IS
DOING IT WRONG AND WE NEED TO
FIGHT TOUGH.
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO IS
SAYING THESE THINGS.
IT IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE.
IT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE THINK THE
MORAL HIGH GROUND IS ONLY WORTH
SO MUCH.
THEY ARE TIRED OF LOSING.
THIS IS KIND OF THE MICHAEL
SCHOOL OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.
HE HAS BEEN SAYING WE NEED TO
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ON
THE BALLOT TAKE UP THAT MESSAGE
BECAUSE IF SO, IT'S GOING TO BE
AN EVEN UGLIER POLITICAL CYCLE
THAN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN SO FAR.
>> RIGHT BECAUSE WHAT RELS --
ELSE ARE WE
SEEING FROM DEMOCRATS?
>> IT VARIES.
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO
ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT
TRUMP.
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US,
WHAT WE STAND FOR.
THAT IS A DIFFERENT MESSAGE.
THERE IS ALSO SO MUCH ANGER IN
THE BASE.
PEOPLE ARE FURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AND
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.
PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT AS
WELL.
SO I THINK ITS GOING TO BE A
TEST FOR PEOPLE LOOKING AHEAD TO
2020.
WILL YOU BE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE
THAT RUNS ANGRY OR ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE THAT RUNS WITH IDEAS?
IT IS A CHOICE DEMOCRATS WILL
HAVE TO
MAKE.
>> NIKKI HALEY REANNOUNCE HERD
PLAN -- ANNOUNCE HERD --
ANNOUNCED HER PLAN TO RESIGN.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN
POLICY?
>> FIRST HE HAS TO FIND SOMEBODY
TO REPLACE HER.
YOU KNOW NIKKI HALEY IS AN
INTERESTING CASE.
SHE SOMEONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE
WHO SERVED IN THIS
ADMINISTRATION AND CAME OUT WITH
SORT OF HER STAR BURNING
BRIGHTER THAN WHEN SHE CAME INTO
THE ADMINISTRATION.
SHE IS SOMEBODY WITH NATIONAL
AMBITIONS AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE
PART OF WHAT PEOPLE IN TRUMP
WORLD WANTED TO DO WAS DAMP DOWN
THE IDEA SHE WAS GOING TO BE
CHALLENGING PRESIDENT TRUMP.
SHE DID THAT HERSELF.
SHE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON
THE BALLOT IN ANY -- AT ANY
LEVEL IN 2020.
I WILL SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR
TIME.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> FEMA IS ROUNDING UP TROOPS
TO SEND TO FLORIDA AND GEORGIA
IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE
MICHAEL.
ACCORDING TO THE FEMA
ADMINISTRATOR THE RECENT
INCREASE IN NATURAL DISASTER
SOCIAL SECURITY --
DISASTERS IS PUTTING A STRAIN ON
THE AGENCY.
>> WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THAT
CONCERNS YOU THE MOST?
>> STORM SURGE, THE OCEAN RISE.
>> FEMA ADMINISTRATOR SAID THE
IMAGES CIG GUEST MONTHS OR YEARS
OF RECOVERY FOR THE HARDEST HIT
AREAS.
>> POWER WILL BE OUT FOR WEEKS
AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE
HEAVILY DAMAGED.
>> WE CAUGHT UP TO LONG AFTER HE
BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
>> SO THEY ARE REPORTING THAT
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
HURRICANES EVER TO HIT OUR
COUNTRY.
IS THAT ACTUALLY A FACT?
>> UM, WELL -- SO -- IN THIS
AREA, THIS WOULD BE THE MOST
INTENSE HURRICANE THAT STRUCK
THIS AREA SINCE 1851.
>> FEMA HAS ABOUT 3,000
EMPLOYEES IN THE FIELD PLUS
AIRCRAFT AND SEARCH AND RESCUE
TEAMS READY TO MOVE IN TO BOTH
FLORIDA AND GEORGIA.
BY -- FEMA IS UNDER CONSIDERABLE
PRESSURE.
>> IS FEMA STRETCHED THIN?
>> YES, YOU START TO REACH A
POINT WHERE THE INTERNAL
CAPABILITIES TO MANAGE NOT THE
ONLY DAY TO DAY MISSION OF WHAT
WE DO BUT ALSO THE NUMBER OF --
THE SHEER NUMBER OF DISASTERS.
NOT JUST THE SHEER NUMBER BUT
HOW INTENSE THESE DISASTERS HAVE
BEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A
HALF.
IT STARTS TO -- PUT STRESS
INSIDE THE AGENCY.
>> AND THAT IS MAGNIFIED BECAUSE
FIVE MONTHS INTO THE HURRICANE
SEASON SOME OF THE TOP JOBS AT
FEMA HAVE YET TO BE FILLED.
TODAY IN A BRIEFING
ADMINISTRATOR LONG EXPRESSED HIS
FRUSTRATION THAT HIS DEPUTY AND
YET TO BE CONFIRMED EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS NOMINATED THIS PAST
SUMMER.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING
HURRICANE MICHAEL HIT THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY.
NEARLY 30 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE
SOUTHEAST WILL BE IMPACTED BY
THE STORM.
WHICH IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST
HURRICANES TO EVER HIT THE
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.
MARK IS CHIEF OF TECHNOLOGY AND
SCIENCE AT THE NATIONAL
HURRICANE CENTER.
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM MIAMI.
MARK, LETS START WITH THE LATEST
ON MICHAEL.
WHERE IS IT NOW AND WHERE IS IT
HEADED?
>> ITS MOVED INTO SOUTHWEST
GEORGIA.
IT WILL CONTINUE INTO SOUTH
CAROLINA AND INTO NORTH CAROLINA
AND THEN OUT TO SEA.
WE ARE ALSO STILL SEEING FROM
THE DOPPLER RADAR, WE ARE STILL
SEEING WINDS UP TO ABOUT 100
MILES PER HOUR IN THIS SMALL
AREA.
>> WHAT IS THE BIGGEST THREAT
GOING FORWARD?
>> RIGHT NOW THE THREAT IS STILL
GOING BE FROM WIND ALONG THE
NARROW PATH ALONG THE CENTER.
THIS AREA OF GEORGIA IS HIGHLY
WOODED AND IT DOESN'T TAKE LOT
OF WIND IN THAT INLAND AREA TO
KNOCK DOWN TREES AND CAUSE POWER
OUTAGES.
WE STILL ANTICIPATE SOME WIND
DAMAGE ALONG THE WAY.
THAT IN COMBINATION WITH OUR
RAINFALL TOTALS OF 4-6 INCHES
ALONG THE PATH.
>> IS IT UNUSUAL?
>> ACTUALLY THE GENERAL RULE OF
THUMB IS THAT IT LOSES ITS
INTENSITY IN TEN HOURS.
IT CAN STAY A HURRICANE FOR UP
TO TEN HOURS.
MOVING PRETTY FAST, THOSE WINDS
CAN PENETRATE VERY FAR INLAND.
>> SO IT IS NOT OVER YET IS THE
BOTTOM LINE.
>> UH-HUH.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
BEFORE WE DO, WE WANT TO LET YOU
KNOW ABOUT AN EXCITING CHANGE.

WIND BUT ITS SO DIFFERENT RIGHT
NOW COMPARED TO HOW IT WAS A FEW
HOURS AGO.
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME OUTSIDE

BECAUSE IT JUST WOULD HAVE BEEN
TOO DANGEROUS.
WE WATCH ADD IT HAS WIND SNAPPED

THEY TOOK TONS OF PALM TREES
DOWN.
MANY SIGNS AND COMPLETELY ON THE
GROUND AND WIRES AS WELL.
TAKING POWER OUT ALL OVER THE
AREA.
AND WATER, THE RAIN JUST COMING
DOWN IN BUCKETS.
>> AND SO THERE IS NO POWER
WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
CLOSE TO 200,000 PEOPLE IN THIS
AREA ARE WITHOUT POWER.
WE LOST POWER ACTUALLY BEFORE
THE BRUNT, BEFORE THE EYE CAME
THROUGH THIS AREA.
THAT'S THE SIMILAR SITUATION FOR
MANY PEOPLE.
NO WORD YET ON WHEN THE POWER
MIGHT COME ON.
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA HAS SAID
THE RESTORING POWER IS HIS
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BECAUSE ITS
VERY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY AS
PEOPLE BEGIN TO REBUILD.
>> SO HILLARY HAVE YOU SEEN
PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT AT ALL OR
FIRST RESPONDERS?
>> RIGHT NOW PEOPLE ARE STARTING
TO GET OUT AND SURVEY THE
DAMAGE.
THIS ROAD HAS BEEN VERY QUIET.
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE
DRIVE BY.
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING DURING
THIS STORM THE GOVERNOR SAID
EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WOULD NOT BE
RESCUING PEOPLE.
THEY ARE SURVEYING THE DAMAGE TO
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING
ON.
AS THEY ARE DOING THAT, WE ARE
ALSO NOTICING RESIDENTSES ARE
COMING OUT.
>> AND HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO
TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT HOW THIS
MIGHT COMPARE TO OTHER STORMS
THAT HAVE HIT THE AREA?
>> WE HAVE.
I THINK UNIVERSAL THINK ONE
THING THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS
THIS HAPPENED SO QUICKLY.
FOR SOMETHING LIKE MARIA OR IRMA
OR FLORENCE IT WAS PREDICTED
ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE SO PEOPLE
HAD TIME TO PREPARE.
THIS HURRICANE FORMED SO
QUICKLY.
BY THE TIME PEOPLE WERE GETTING
THE MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDERS
HE DIDN'T -- THEY DIDN'T REALIZE
THERE WAS A STORM AT ALL.
THEY ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW
INTENSE THIS STORM WAS BUT ALSO
HOW FAST IT WAS.
IT REALLY SURPRISED US TOO.
THIS STORM CAME IN WITH SUCH
INTENSITY BUT ALSO LEFT VERY
QUICKLY.
>> I KNOW PEOPLE ARE STILL
OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO GET A HANDLE
ON THE SEVERITY OF THE DAMAGE
THERE BUT IS THERE ANY SENSE AT
ALL FROM FOLKS WHAT THEIR
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO
BE AS THEY TRY TO RECOVER?
>> WELL JUST LIKE EVERY STORM
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE IS SOMETHING
THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY WORRIED
ABOUT.
WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH YOUR
FOUNDATION OR VERY EXPENSIVE
REPAIRS.
THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST
OF THE STORM.
DOWNED POWER LINES AND TREES ARE
ALSO A CONCERN FOR PEOPLE.
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS VERY MUCH.
STAY SAFE.
>>> HURRICANE MICHAEL MAY BE ON
ITS WAY OUT BUT MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE ARE STILL IN ITS PATH.
CRAIG IS TRACKING THE STORM.
>> THE STORM CONTINUES TO MOVE
QUICKLY TO THE NORTHEAST.
THAT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE ITS
GOING TO PULL THE BAD WEATHER
OUT OF THE AREA THAT WAS MOST
IMPACTED.
THE WIND FIELD IS STILL RATHER
LARGE.
SPECIALLY NEAR THE CORE THE
WINDS ARE VERY STRONG.
THE FUTURE TRACK TAKES IT TO THE
NORTHEAST.
DURING THE DAY TOMORROW MOVES
QUICKLY THROUGH THE CAROLINAS
AND THEN OFF THE EAST COAST BY
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY
MORNING.
ITS OUT TO SEA AFTER THAT.
THE MAIN THING IS GOING TO BE A
WIDESPREAD WIND FIELD THAT WILL
CONTINUE TO DO A LOT TREE
DAMAGE.
POWER OUTAGES ARE TO BE EXPECTED
FROM GEORGIA THROUGH THE
CAROLINAS.
MAYBE EVEN SOUTHEAST PARTS OF
VIRGINIA AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF
DELAWARE.
THE WINDS ARE GOING TO GRADUALLY
COME DOWN THE MOST INTENSE
WINDS.
AS THE STORM MOVES ALONG THE
WIND FIELD SPREADS OUT A BIT
BECAUSE THE STORM IS WEAKENING.
IN TERMS OF RAINFALL, ANOTHER
GOOD REASON OR ANOTHER GOOD
THING THAT THIS FAST MOVEMENT IS
THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE
EXCESSIVE AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL.
THERE IS THE THREAT FOR SOME
FLASH FLOODING ALONG THE TRACK
OF MICHAEL BUT ON AVERAGE ABOUT
3-6 INCHES AND BRIEF TROPICAL
DOWNPOURS EXPECTED WITH THIS
SYSTEM.
THERE IS ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF
TORNADOS ALONG AND TO THE RIGHT
OF THE TRACK.
THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH THIS FAST
MOVE WEATHER --.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> SEVERAL STATES ARE REPORTING
CASES OF A RARE ILLNESS THAT
CAUSES PARALYSIS IN CHILDREN.
NOW A NEW PROCEDURE AIMS TO GIVE
HOPE TO CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM
THE VIRAL INFECTION.
CHRIS MARTINEZ REPORTS.
>> WAS BORN WITH CHRONIC ASTHMA.
AN ATTACK BEFORE HER 2ND
BIRTHDAY WAS DIFFERENT.
>> SHE TAKES THE NEBULIZER SO
THAT WASN'T WORKING.
>> SHE APPEARED TO MAKE A FULL
RECOVERY IN THE HOSPITAL.
WHEN SHE RETURNED HOME --
>> SHE WAS PLAYING, NORMAL KID.
MY HUSBAND NOTICED THAT HER ARM
WAS KIND OF JUST HANGING THERE.
>> SHE HAD LOST ALL FUNCTION IN
HER RIGHT ARM.
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH AFM.
AFM AFFECTS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.
SOME PATIENTS ARE LEFT
PARALYZED.
>> ABOUT HALF THE KIDS WITH AFM
WILL STRENGTHEN UP ENOUGH ON
THEIR OWN.
THE OTHER HALF WON'T.
>> HE IS PIONEERING NERVE
TRANSFER SURGERY TO HELP THESE
PATIENTS.
DOCTORS PERFORMED TWO SURGERIES
TAKING NERVES FROM HER RIBS AND
DIAPHRAGM AND DIVERTING THEM TO
HER ARM TO MAKE HER FINGERS,
WRISTS AND ELBOW BEND AND
STRAIGHTEN?
YOU HAVE TO GET IN THERE BY 8 TO
10 MONTHS IDEALLY.
AT THAT POINT YOU RUN THE RISK
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO REVERSE THE
PARALYSIS.
>> THERAPISTS HAVE BEEN WORKING
WITH HER TO TRAIN HER NERVES.
ITS BEEN 18 MOVRPSS -- MONTHS
SINCE THE FIRST SURGERY.
>> WE HAD TO TEACH HER HOW TO GO
UP THE STAIRS THOUSAND, HOW TO
GET UP.
>> TOOK -- HOW TO
GET UP.
>> DOCTORS HOPE SHE WILL SEE
EVEN MORE IMPROVEMENT
>>> WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR
HURRICANE MICHAEL THROUGHOUT THE
EVENING.
STAY WITH CBSN FOR THE LATEST ON
THIS DEADLY STORM.
>>> HELLO, I'M BILL WHITAKER 
WITH 60 MINUTES. 
>> THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT'S 
OUT OF CONTROL. 
IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW, 
PEOPLE DIE. 
>> WE WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN 
ABOUT THIS. 
ABOUT "60 MINUTES." 
>> I DID SEE THE REPORT. 
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THE 
REPORT, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT 
SERIOUSLY. 
>> YOU KNOW WHAT A CHILLING 
PICTURE THAT PAINTS? 
>>> HI EVERYONE, I'M ELAINE 
QUIJANO. 
AT LEAST ONE PERSON IS 
CONFIRMED DEAD AFTER HURRICANE 
MICHAEL SLAMMED THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 
THE HISTORIC CATEGORY 4 STORM 
MADE LANDFALL WITH TOP 
SUSTAINED WINDS OF 155 MILES 
PER HOUR. 
IT HAS SINCE WEAKENED TO A 
CATEGORY 1 STORM, BUT STILL HAS 
DAMAGING WINDS AND RAIN AS IT 
MOVES ACROSS GEORGIA. 
WE ARE SEEING PICTURES OF 
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE AND 
FLOODING. 
SOME AREAS SAW 10 FEET OF STORM 
SURGE. 
THE HURRICANE HAS SLOWED A BIT, 
BUT IS STILL DELIVERING A HEAVY 
BLOW AS IT MOVES INTO ALABAMA, 
AND GEORGIA. 
JOINING ME NOW FOR THE LATEST 
ON HURRICANE MICHAEL IS CBS 
NEWS WEATHER PRODUCER, DAVID 
PARKINSON. 
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING AND 
TRACKING. 
>> THE VERY LATEST OF THE STORM 
IS IT IS NOW JUST ABOUT TO 
ALBANY, GEORGIA. 
SO IT IS WELL INLAND. 
THEY ARE OUT OF THE RAIN IN 
ALMOST THE ENTIRETY OF THE 
STATE OF FLORIDA. 
SO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 
THERE'S THE BACK, THAT'S IT. 
THAT'S ALL THE RAIN IN THE 
STATE OF FLORIDA. 
WE'RE DOWN NOW TO 85 MILES PER 
HOUR. 
SO WE DROP 5 MILES AN HOUR OFF 
THE LAST HOUR. 
BUT LOOK AT HOW FAST IT'S 
MOVING. 
IT'S MOVING NORTHEAST AT 17 
MILES AN HOUR. 
SO IT IS ON ITS HORSE. 
IT WILL BE IN THE CAROLINAS BY 
TOMORROW MORNING, AND IN SOUTH 
CAROLINA SPECIFICALLY. 
THEN IT WILL BE OFF THE COAST 
OF THE DELMARVA BY FRIDAY 
MORNING. 
SO UNLIKE ALL OF THE STORMS 
THAT WE'VE HAD OF LATE, YOUR 
FLORENCES, YOUR IRMA'S, YOUR 
HARVEY'S, THIS ONE HAD NOTHING 
BOTTLING IT UP. 
THERE'S A LOOK AT THE MAP. 
WE'RE DOWN TO A TROPICAL STORM 
ALREADY BY TOMORROW, FIRST 
THING IN THE MORNING AT 2:00 
A.M. 
WE COULD BE THERE AS SOON AS 
11:00 P.M. 
OR MIDNIGHT. 
YOU WILL BE DOWN TO ALMOST THE 
EDGE OF BEING A TROPICAL STORM 
AT 2:00 P.M. 
THURSDAY. 
THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT GOING OVER 
LAND WILL DO TO YOU, IF YOU'RE 
A TROPICAL STORM. 
BUT STILL BRINGING RAIN AND 
SOME OF THE WORST EFFECTS 
ACTUALLY TO THE WEST OF THE 
CENTER OF THE TRACK. 
>> WHAT ARE THE THINGS 
SPECIFICALLY THAT PEOPLE IN 
THOSE AREAS NEED TO BE 
CONCERNED ABOUT? 
>> SO RAIN IS A BIG CONCERN IN 
TERMS OF FLASH FLOODING. 
THERE'S A FLASH FLOOD WATCH 
THAT GOES ACTUALLY ALL THE WAY 
ALMOST UP TO BOSTON. 
4 TO 6 INCHES OF RAIN IS 
POSSIBLE JUST IN THAT PORTION 
OF NORTHERN GEORGIA, INTO SOUTH 
CAROLINA. 
THERE'S ANOTHER AREA AGAIN FROM 
NORTH CAROLINA UP INTO 
VIRGINIA. 
AND PARTICULARLY, WHERE YOU'VE 
GOT SOME TOPOGRAPHY THERE, 
YOU'VE GOT MUDSLIDES WITH WIND 
LOOSENING UP THE SOIL, ALL OF 
THAT. 
THE GROUND IS ALREADY SATURATED 
FROM FLORENCE. 
THE WINDS ARE STILL FAIRLY 
FULL. 
THAT'S A BIG CONCERN. 
AND THEN THE WIND, THOUGH 
DECREASING CONSIDERABLY, A 60 
MILE-AN-HOUR GUST CAN TAKE DOWN 
TREES. 
IT WOULDN'T BE OUT OF THE REALM 
OF POSSIBLY TO SEE MORE POWER 
OUTAGES. 
>> JUST HOW WAS THIS STORM ABLE 
TO INTENSIFY SO QUICKLY. 
>> THE INTERESTING THING IS WE 
WENT FROM 90 MILES PER HOUR AT 
5:00 A.M. 
ON TUESDAY, ALL MY DAYS ARE 
RUNNING TOGETHER NOW, TO 1:55 
AT 1:00 P.M. 
THIS IS ALL EAST COAST TIME, ON 
WEDNESDAY. 
SO IN ABOUT 32 HOURS WE ALMOST 
GAINED NEARLY 70 MILES AN HOUR 
ON THAT STORM. 
SO THAT SHOWS YOU JUST HOW 
QUICKLY IT INTENSIFIED. 
WE HAD WARM WATER. 
WE HAD WATER THAT WAS SOMEWHERE 
BETWEEN IN FAHRENHEIT, 3 AND 6 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 
THE GULF IS ALWAYS BATH WATER. 
IT ALWAYS TURBO CHARGES STORMS, 
BUT THIS WAS EVEN MORE SO. 
THERE WAS SOME DRY AIR. 
IT DIDN'T WORK ITS WAY IN, SO 
YOU'VE GOT A STORM THAT WAS 
BOTH RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING, AND 
RAPIDLY DEEPENING. 
A RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING STORM IS 
THE STORM WHERE THE WINDS ARE 
INCREASING AT A CLIP. 
IT'S AN INVERSE RELATIONSHIP. 
THE LOWER THE PRESSURE, THE 
HIGHER THE WINDS, BUT IN TERMS 
OF WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE 
STRONGEST EVER, RIGHT, THIS IS 
THE THIRD STRONGEST BY PRESSURE 
STORM IN U.S. RECORDED HISTORY. 
IF YOU ONLY COUNT THE SATELLITE 
AREA, IT'S ACTUALLY NUMBER 2. A 
TRULY RARE STORM, THAT 
SEEMINGLY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, 
IT ALWAYS HAD THE CHANCE TO DO 
IT, BUT WE FELT THAT, OH, 
BETWEEN THE SHEER AND THE DRY 
AIR, IT'S NOT GOING TO GET 
THERE. 
AT 8:00 P.M. 
LAST NIGHT, WE SAW THE CLOUDS 
WERE STARTING TO BILLOW. 
THEY WERE GETTING REALLY COLD, 
AND WE KNEW IT WAS OFF TO THE 
RACES THEN. 
AT THAT POINT. 
THAT'S WHY, WHEN WE REALIZED 
JUST HOW BAD THIS WAS GOING TO 
BE. 
IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE AT THAT 
POINT, WHICH IS WHY WHEN THOSE 
MANDATORY EVACUATION ORDERS 
COME OUT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
FOLLOW THEM THEN, AND NOT THE 
11th HOUR OH, NO, BECAUSE THAT 
PUTS YOU IN DANGER. 
>> DAVID PARKINSON, THANKS SO 
MUCH, DAVID. 
>> SURE THING. 
>>> ONE OF THE HARDEST HIT 
AREAS IS PANAMA CITY BEACH, 
JUST WEST OF WHERE MICHAEL MADE 
LANDFALL, RIPPING OFF ROOFS, 
BLOWING DOWN TREES, AND SENDING 
DEBRIS FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. 
JEFF GLOR IS THERE WITH MORE. 
>> Reporter: THE SOUND 
UNMISTAKABLE. 
MORE LIKE A JETLINER AT 
TAKEOFF. 
>> OH, MY GOD. 
>> Reporter: HERE IN PANAMA 
CITY BEACH, WE WERE NEAR THE 
CENTER OF THE STORM, AS IT 
BLASTED AWAY. 
WE'RE NOW APPROACHING THE WORST 
OF HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
THE PALM BEACH CITY MANAGER 
TELLS US, HE THINKS ABOUT 50% 
OF RESIDENTS HAVE LEFT TOWN. 
AT THIS POINT, THEY ARE NO 
LONGER RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY 
CALLS. 
IF SOMEONE HAS A LIFE-
THREATENING EMERGENCY, THEY 
LIKELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 0 
GET THERE. 
WHEN MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL, ITS 
WINDS TOPPED OUT AT 155 MILES 
AN HOUR. 
THAT IS JUST 2 MILES AN HOUR 
SHORT OF CATEGORY 5. GUSTS MAY 
HAVE CLOCKED IN HIGHER. 
>> THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE. 
RIGHT UP AGAINST PRETTY MUCH 
ALL WINDOWS. 
STORM JUST TRIES TO PUSH 
THROUGH AS BEST IT CAN. 
>> Reporter: IT WAS ENOUGH TO 
RIP ROOFTOPS OFF BUILDINGS. 
>> RIGHT NOW, WE'RE INSIDE THE 
HOTEL WITH FLASHLIGHTS PRETTY 
MUCH HUNKERED DOWN DURING THE 
WORST OF THE STORM. 
WETRY TO GET BACK OUTSIDE 
WHENEVER IT'S SAFE TO ASSESS 
THE DAMAGE. 
>> Reporter: JUST A FEW MILES 
TO THE EAST OF PANAMA CITY 
BEACH LIES THE TOURIST TOWN OF 
MEXICO CITY BEACH, WHICH TOOK A 
DIRECT HIT. 
MICHAEL APPEARED TO FLATTEN 
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. 
STORM SURGES UP TO 8 FEET AND 
RAINFALL TOPPING 5 INCHES, 
SUBMERGED MANY HOUSES THERE. 
OTHER BUILDINGS LAY IN PILES. 
MICHAEL IS THE LOWEST PRESSURE 
HURRICANE TO STRIKE THE U.S. 
MAINLAND SINCE 1969. 
NOTHING THIS FEROCIOUS HAS EVER 
HIT THE PANHANDLE. 
>> JUST EAST OF MEXICO BEACH, 
WHERE HURRICANE MICHAEL MADE 
LANDFALL IS PORT ST. JOE 
FLORIDA. 
THE AREA IS ALREADY SEEING 
HEAVY FLOODING, WHICH IS 
BLOCKING ROADS, AND CAUSING 
DIFFICULTY FOR FIRST RESPONDERS 
THERE. 
>> Reporter: HURRICANE MICHAEL 
SLAMMED INTO PORT ST. JOE 
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. 
HEAVY RAINS, AND TREE SNAPPING 
WINDS PUMMELED THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RODE OUT 
THE STORM AT HOME, DESPITE 
BEING TOLD TO GET OUT. 
PORT ST. JOE RESIDENTS WENT 
INTO RESCUE MODE AFTER 
MICHAEL'S 12-FOOT STORM SURGE 
TRAPPED PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES. 
VOLUNTEERS IN SMALL BOATS AND 
BIG TRUCKS PUSHED THROUGH 
STREETS BLOCKED BY TREES, AND 
SUBMERGED IN SEVERAL FEET OF 
WATER. 
DONNA HADDOCK DIDN'T HAVE A WAY 
TO CHECK ON HER FAMILY, SO SHE 
USED OUR CELL PHONE TO TELL HER 
TRAPPED NEPHEW, THAT HELP WAS 
ON THE WAY. 
WITHIN MINUTES, A DRIVER IN A 
BIG PICKUP TRUCK PULLED UP TO 
THE WATERLOGGED HOUSE, AND 
CARRIED JEFF PITS AND HIS DOG 
BUDDY TO HIGHER GROUND. 
>> HOW WAS THE WATER LEVELS? 
>> GOT UP TO 4 FEET IN THE 
HOUSE. 
>> IN THE HOUSE? 
>> IN THE HOUSE UP TO ABOUT MY 
HIP. 
>> Reporter: THE DRIVER WAS A 
MAN NAMED CHRIS. 
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TALK AS 
HE DROVE BACK TO HELP MORE 
PEOPLE. 
BUT HIS ACTIONS SAID PLENTY IN 
THIS SMALL COMMUNITY. 
>> WHERE WOULD THESE PEOPLE BE 
WITHOUT PEOPLE WITH BIG TRUCKS 
AND BOATS? 
>> WHERE IS ANYBODY WITHOUT 
FRIENDS? 
>> Reporter: EVEN AS THIS STORM 
WAS PASSING OVERHEAD, 
VOLUNTEERS CAME OUT WITH 
CHAINSAWS, WORKING TO CLEAR THE 
STREETS OF DOWNED TREES. 
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY, 
HURRICANE FORCED WINDS DAMAGED 
BUILDINGS, AND EVEN FLIPPED 
OVER THIS RV. 
AS PEOPLE ASSESS THE DAMAGE, 
DONNA IS JUST THANKFUL SHE 
SURVIVED ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
HURRICANES TO HIT THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. 
>> HOW WAS IT TO FINALLY SEE 
HIM ON THE BACK OF THAT TRUCK? 
>> THAT WAS GOOD. 
GOOD. 
WE CAN REST EASY NOW. 
>> CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT, OMAR 
VILLAFRANCA JOINS ME. 
WHAT ARE THE CURRENT CONDITIONS 
WHERE YOU ARE? 
>> Reporter: IT IS STILL VERY 
WINDY. 
THE WIND IS COMING THROUGH AT A 
GOOD CLIP HERE. 
IT WILL COME UP, AND IT WILL 
DIE DOWN A BIT, BUT WE ARE 
STILL GETTING STEADY GUSTS. 
TWO THINGS. 
THE RAIN HAS REALLY STOPPED IN 
THIS AREA, AND SOME OF THE 
FLOODING, SOME OF THE STORM 
SURGE THAT WE SAW EARLIER IS 
STARTING TO RECEDE A LITTLE 
BIT. 
THE BIG ISSUE IS GOING TO BE OF 
COURSE, CLEANUP. 
THAT IS GOING TO BE A LONG TERM 
THING. 
WE'VE SEEN TREES DOWN. 
WE'VE SEEN, MATTER OF FACT, 
PIECES OF FENCE THAT ARE 
BASICALLY JUST STREWN ABOUT 
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, AND ENDED UP 
IN OTHER PEOPLE'S YARDS AS 
WELL. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE PART OF THE 
LONG TERM PROCESS OF THE 
CLEANUP. 
ANOTHER THING I WANTED TO SHOW 
YOU OVER HERE. 
SEE IF YOU CAN SEE IT. 
THE PANHANDLE HAS A LOT OF 
THESE PALM TREES, WHEN IT'S 
HURRICANE TIME, THEY'LL SNAP IN 
HALF AND BRING DOWN ALL THE 
POWER LINES. 
THAT ONE IS PROBABLY, MAYBE 50, 
60 FEET, BUT IT'S SNAPPED RIGHT 
IN THE CENTER. 
A LOT OF THOSE ARE BLOCKING THE 
ROADS. 
A LOT OF THOSE HAVE PULLED DOWN 
POWER LINES, AND THAT'S GOING 
TO BE A MAJOR PART OF THE 
CLEANUP HERE. 
>> TELL US, OMAR, WHAT ABOUT 
FIRST RESPONDERS? 
HAVE YOU SEEN THEM OUT AND 
ABOUT? 
>> Reporter: WE ARE STARTING TO 
SEE THEM TRICKLE OUT. 
WE DID SEE SHERIFF DEPUTIES 
HERE IN GULF COUNTY. 
THEY WERE KIND OF CRUISING 
AROUND. 
BUT THEY HAD BASICALLY LIMITED 
CAPABILITIES OF WHAT THEY COULD 
DO. 
MATTER OF FACT, ONE OF THE 
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS HERE TOLD 
US THAT THE HOSPITALS ARE 
CLOSED. 
ALL THE AMBULANCES ARE FARTHER 
INLAND. 
IF YOU NEED MEDICAL HELP, IT'S 
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL AFTER 
THE STORM. 
WE DID SEE SOME PORT ST. JOE 
POLICE. 
THEY HAD ONE OF THESE M WRAPS. 
THEY WENT INTO THIS 
NEIGHBORHOOD BEHIND ME. 
SOME OF THESE HOMES WERE UNDER 
4 FEET OF WATER. 
WE SAW THEM PULL OUT AN ELDERLY 
COUPLE, AND TAKE THEM TO HIGHER 
GROUND. 
FAMILY WAS WAITING. 
WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THEM. 
SO THE FIRST RESPONDERS ARE 
COMING OUT. 
BUT THE BIG THING THAT PEOPLE 
WANT TO SEE HE, THEY WANT TO 
SEE THE POWER CREWS. 
THEY WANT TO SEE THOSE ORANGE 
FLASHING LIGHTS, AND THOSE 
CHERRY PICKERS, BECAUSE THAT 
MEANS PROGRESS, THAT MEANS SOON 
HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL HAVE 
ELECTRICITY. 
>> OMAR, HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE 
TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW 
THIS STORM COMPARES TO OTHERS 
THAT MIGHT HAVE HIT THE AREA? 
>> Reporter: THERE ARE SOME 
PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY REALLY 
COULDN'T COMPARE IT. 
THERE WAS HERMINE A FEW YEARS 
AGO IN 2016. 
THERE WAS A RAIN EVENT, AND IT 
KIND OF PERKED PEOPLE'S EARS 
UP. 
TO HAVE A CATEGORY 4 JUST 
BARRELING TOWARDS THE 
PENINSULA, IT HAS BEEN DECADES 
SINCE ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAS 
BEEN THOUGHT OF IN THE AREA. 
FOR SOME REASON, IT ALSO TURNS 
OFF. 
IT MAYBE HEADS TO THE BIG BEND 
AREA NEAR TALLAHASSEE. 
BUT FOR PEOPLE IN THIS AREA, 
PEOPLE WERE LISTENING. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE EVACUATED. 
THEY WENT FARTHER INLAND. 
IN PORT ST. JOE, THERE'S ABOUT 
3500 PEOPLE, AND THE SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT WAS TELLING US ABOUT 
60% STAYED. 
THEY STAYED IN THE AREA AND 
DECIDED TO RIDE IT OUT AND 
WE'RE TRYING TO SEE IF THOSE 
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME BACK. 
THEY'RE COMING TO CHECK ON 
THEIR PROPERTY. 
THEY'RE COMING TO CHECK ON 
THEIR BUSINESSES, AND THEY'RE 
HAVING TO DO THAT FIRST 
ASSESSMENT, WHICH SOMETIMES CAN 
BE SHOCKING. 
>> OMAR, YOU MENTIONED PEOPLE 
ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THOSE POWER 
CREWS. 
WHAT DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE 
BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE FOR 
PEOPLE AS THEY ATTEMPT TO TRY 
TO RECOVER? 
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S IN THE VERY 
EARLY STAGES. 
I'M WONDERING, YOU KNOW, YOU 
DON'T HAVE POWER. 
YOU DON'T HAVE AIR 
CONDITIONING. 
I IMAGINE IT'S PRETTY WARM. 
>> Reporter: IT IS. 
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE 
GOOD PREPPERS, AND THEY HAVE 
GENERATORS READY TO GO. 
THEY WERE PART OF THAT CREW WHO 
WAS WAITING IN LINE AT A GAS 
STATION TO FILL UP GAS TANKS. 
THEY WERE CHARGING THEIR PHONES 
AND CARS, BUT THERE'S NO CELL 
SIGNAL RIGHT NOW. 
PRETTY MUCH DEAD IN THE AREA. 
THE BIG CHALLENGE IS GOING TO 
BE FOR POWER CREWS. 
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DRIVE 
DOWN ROADS. 
WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE CHAINSAW 
CREWS TO START CLEARING SOME OF 
THE ROADS. 
VOLUNTEERS HAVE STARTED DOING 
IT AS WELL. 
CLEARING SOME OF THOSE ROADS. 
MOVING THE DEBRIS OFF THOSE 
ROADS, SO THE POWER CREWS CAN 
GO DOWN, TAKE DOWN THE OLD 
LINES, OR PICK THEM UP, PUT A 
NEW POLE UP, AND HOPEFULLY, 
THEY KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE 
SEVERAL DAYS, THEY'RE JUST 
HOPING IT'S NOT SEVERAL WEEKS 
BEFORE THEY GET POWER. 
>> OMAR VILLAFRANCA FOR US. 
THANK YOU.
>>> COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK, 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SEEKING 
SHELTER DUE TO HURRICANE 
MICHAEL. 
THE MOST POWERFUL STORM TO HIT 
THE U.S. MAINLAND IN NEARLY 50 
YEARS. 
PLUS, LAWMAKERS ARE CALLING FOR 
ANSWERS ABOUT A SAUDI 
JOURNALIST WHO HAS BEEN MISSING 
FOR MORE THAN A WEEK. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE'S 
LOOKING INTO WHAT HAPPENED. 
THIS IS CBSN. 
CBS NEWS, ALWAYS ON. 
>>> THE DOW JONES PLUNGED MORE 
THAN 800 POINTS WEDNESDAY. 
WHILE THE S & P SANK MORE THAN 
90 POINTS. 
TECH COMPANIES SAW THE SHARPEST 
LOSSES AS ANALYSTS SAY 
INVESTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT 
RISING INTEREST RATES. 
THE LONDONEN BUREAU CHIEF FOR 
THE STREET.COM JOINS ME NOW. 
THANKS FOR BEING HERE. 
>> YOU'RE WELCOME. 
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE 
SUCH A SHARP DROP TODAY? 
>> I REALLY WAS. 
AN ORDINARY DAY, THE LOSSES 
BEGAN TO MOUNT, AND SUDDENLY 
BEGAN TO ESCALATE, AND TUMBLE, 
AND WE SAW THE SHARP DECLINES 
WE DID TODAY. 
THE NASDAQ HAD ITS WORST DAY IN 
SEVEN YEARS TODAY. 
ABSOLUTELY ASTONISHING. 
>> WHY DID SOME TECH STOCKS 
SUFFER SUCH BIG HITS? 
>> THEY'RE VERY SENSITIVE TO 
RISING INTEREST RATES, BECAUSE 
THEY DO CARRY A LOT OF DEBT AS 
THEY EXPAND THEIR BUSINESSES. 
THE MORE PRESSURED THEIR 
PROFITS BECOME, AND INVESTORS 
WILL TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY OUT 
OF THE ACCOUNT. 
THE TECH HAS LED THE GAINS FOR 
MOST OF THE YEARS. 
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF PROFIT 
TAKING AS WE HEAD INTO THE 
FINAL MONTHS. 
IF YOU'RE AN INVEST, MAYBE JUST 
SIT IT OUT UNTIL CHRISTMAS AND 
SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
>> WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS 
THAT HELPED THE SELL-OFF. 
>> THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED IT 
TODAY WHEN HE WAS CRITICAL OF 
THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND THEIR 
INTEREST RATE POLICY. 
HE THINKS THEY'RE MOVING A 
LITTLE TOO FAST. 
THERE ARE SOME WHO AGREE. 
THE U.S. ECONOMY IS RUNNING AT 
THE FATEST PACE IN MORE THAN 
FIVE YEARS, IT'S PROBABLY GOING 
TO CONTINUE THAT INTO THE NEXT. 
WE'RE EARNING A LITTLE BIT MORE 
EVERY WEEK. 
INFLATION IS TAME. 
THE FED IS MOVING MAYBE A 
LITTLE MORE QUICKLY FOR SOME, 
AND MAYBE NOT AS QUICK FOR 
OTHERS, BECAUSE THEY LOOK BACK 
AT THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, AND 
THINK THE FED WAS A LITTLE SLOW 
BACK THEN, AND LOOK WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
>> THE DOW IS STILL AT RECORD 
LEVELS. 
OVERALL, IS THIS JUST A BLIP? 
IS THIS JUST A MOMENTARIY BLIP 
ON THE RADAR SCREEN IN. 
>> I THINK IT'S STILL DOING 
TERRIBLY WELL. 
AGAIN, ONE OF THE BEST PACES IN 
FIVE YEARS. 
WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE 
CORPORATE PROFITS RISE IN THIS 
QUARTER AROUND 20%. 
THAT'S REALLY HEALTHY EARNINGS, 
AND ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS 
DOING. 
WHAT INVESTORS ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT, IS WHAT HAPPENS IN 2019, 
WHEN THE IMPACT OF TAX CUTS 
STARTS TO FADE AWAY, AND THE 
FEDERAL RESERVE BEGINS TO HIKE 
INTEREST RATES, AND PROBABLY 
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT IS GOING 
TO HAPPEN BETWEEN THE ONGOING 
TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN 
WASHINGTON AND BEIJING. 
AT THE MOM, THEY SIT AT$250 
BILLION, THEY COULD RISE TO 
$500 BILLION, AND THEN BEGIN TO 
IMPACT CONSUMER PRODUCTS. 
THAT COULD HAVE A CASCADING 
EFFECT INTO STOCKS AND 
EVERYTHING ELSE. 
WE MAY NOT KNOW THE TRUE STORY 
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS NOW, BUT 
THIS MIGHT BE ONE OF THE FIRST 
WARNING SIGNS. 
>> SO HOW QUICKLY CAN THE 
MARKET REBOUND FROM WHAT WE'VE 
JUST SEEN? 
┗> IT'S A GREAT QUEST 
I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE 
FASCINATED WITH WHAT HAPPENS 
OVERNIGHT IN THE ASIAN MARKETS. 
CHINA HAS WOBBLED FOR THE LAST 
FEW WEEKS AS A RESULT OF THE 
TRADE WAR. 
IF IT FOLLOWS SUIT FROM WHAT WE 
SAW ON WALL STREET TODAY, WE 
COULD SEE MORE SELLING 
THURSDAY, AND POTENTIALLY INTO 
FRIDAY. 
WHAT I THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN 
IS WITH THE BANK EARNINGS 
BEGINNING ON FRIDAY, WE'LL 
START TO SEE SOME OF THOSE GOOD 
NUMBERS. 
A LOT WILL DEPEND ON WHAT THE 
COMPANIES ARE SEEING IN THE 
MONTHS AHEAD. 
I STILL THINK THE MARKET IS 
GOOD UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR, 
THIS IS WHAT WE CALL A HEALTHY 
CORRECTION. 
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T HURT IT TO 
TAKE SOME OF THAT STEAM OUT, SO 
WE CAN MAYBE BE FOCUSED ON 
UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS, RATHER 
THAN THE SUGAR HIGH AS SOME 
HAVE DESCRIBED IT. 
>> IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR RIGHT 
NOW AND FEELING NERVOUS. 
>> I'D SAY DON'T WORRY. 
IF YOU TRULY BELIEVE IN THE 
MARKET AND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF 
THE COMPANIES YOU OWN, YOU HAVE 
THE CHANCE TO BUY THEM MORE 
CHEAPLY NOW. 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY MAKE A 
LITTLE MORE MONEY. 
IF YOU'VE SEEN THE VALUE OF 
YOUR 401(K) DECLINE A BIT, 
DON'T BE TERRIBLY CONCERNED, 
RISING INTEREST RATES, AND WHAT 
HAPPENS IN THE ASIAN, AND 
EUROPEAN MARKETS OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS. 
THAT WILL GIVE YOU AN EXCELLENT 
INDICATION OF WHAT TO DO NEXT. 
THOSE WILL GIVE YOU THE PICTURE 
YOU NEED. 
BUT DON'T FORGET, THE 
UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS OF THE 
U.S. ECONOMY ARE STILL VERY 
GOOD. 
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK CAN 
WORK AND AS A RESULT, THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEND. 
SPENDING DRIVES 2/3 OF THIS 
ECONOMY, AND IT'S THE BIGGEST 
IN THE WORLD. 
THOSE SIMPLE EQUATIONS IN THE 
OVERALL ARITHMETIC OF THE 
MARKET ARE STILL VERY GOOD, AND 
I DO BELIEVE WE'LL PROBABLY 
BOUNCE BACK FROM THIS.

STRONGEST STORM TO HIT THE 
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY, 
AND WAS THE THIRD STRONGEST 
HURRICANE TO EVER HIT THE 
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES, WITH 
WIND SPEEDS TOPPING 150 MILES 
PER HOUR. 
ROOFS WERE RIPPED OFF OF 
BUILDINGS, AND POWER WAS 
KNOCKED OUT FOR HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. 
RESIDENTS OF BRISTOL, FLORIDA, 
HAVE PACKED LOCAL SHELTERS AS 
HURRICANE MICHAEL PASSES 
THROUGH. 
CBS NEWS'S NICKY BATISTE SPENT 
THE DAY WITH SOME RESIDENTS WHO 
HAD TO BE RESCUED. 
>> Reporter: WE'RE AT THE 
SCHOOL IN BRISTOL, WHICH HAS 
BEEN SERVING AS A SHELTER. 
IT HAS BEEN TOO DANGEROUS TO 
LEAVE AT ALL TODAY. 
WE'RE ALSO JUST TOLD A TORNADO 
HAS ALSO HIT THIS AREA, CAUSING 
SEVERE DAMAGE. 
WE CAN HEAR, AND FEEL THE WIND, 
AND RAIN SHAKING THE DOORS AND 
THE SCHOOL HERE. 
AND THE TREES LINING THE SCHOOL 
OUTSIDE HAVE SPLIT IN HALF. 
WE WERE JUST TOLD BY A LAW 
ENFORCER SAY THERE ARE ROOFS 
LYING IN THE STREETS. 
THE FLORIDIANS HAVE BEEN 
INCREDIBLE, EVEN EMOTIONAL AT 
POINTS. 
ONE MAN JUST WALKED IN NOT LONG 
AGO AFTER THE HURRICANE HIT, 
AND SAID I JUST LOST MY HOME. 
WE'RE ALSO HEARING ENTIRE 
STREETS IN THIS AREA HAVE BEEN 
WIPED OUT. 
NOW COMES MORE WAITING. 
PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD TO STAY 
PUT HERE. 
THEY'RE WAITING TO HEAR WHEN 
IT'S SAFE FOR THEM TO GO HOME, 
AND MANY ARE HOPING TO HEAR 
FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO 
STAYED BEHIND, AND THAT THEY'RE 
SAFE. 
>> THAT WAS NICKY BATISTE 
REPORTING FROM BRISTOL, 
FLORIDA. 
>>> COMING UP, THE HEAD OF FEMA 
ISSUED A STRONG WARNING TO 
PEOPLE STAYING BEHIND IN 
EVACUATION ZONES. 
RIDING OUT HURRICANE MICHAEL 
WILL PUT OTHERS IN DANGER. 
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON FEMA'S STORM 
RESPONSE. 
PLUS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
TRASHING DEMOCRATS PUSH OF 
MEDICARE FOR ALL. 
>>> WHILE HURRICANE MICHAEL 
PUMMELED THE SOUTHEASTERN 
UNITED STATES, THE PRESIDENT 
KEPT DRY FARTHER NORTH, WHERE 
HE HELD HIS SECOND OF FOUR 
RALLIES THIS WEEK. 
THE PRESIDENT SPOKE IN ERIE, 
PENNSYLVANIA, AFTER HIS 
CAMPAIGN STOP FOR MULTIPLE 
REPUBLICANS AHEAD OF THE 
MIDTERMS. 
HE THEN ATTENDED A FUNDRAISER 
IN THE STATE, IN ANOTHER CORNER 
OF THE U.S., WE'RE GETTING A 
LOOK AT THE AFTERMATH OF 
HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
THIS IS MEXICO BEACH, FLORIDA. 
THE PRESIDENT EXPLAINED HIS 
REASONING FOR GOING TO 
PENNSYLVANIA DESPITE THE 
DANGEROUS STORM IMPACTING MANY 
AMERICANS. 
IN A TWEET WEDNESDAY HE SAID HE 
DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT THE 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ATTENDING. 
BUT HE MIGHT FACE SOME SCRUTINY 
FOR HIS DECISIONS. 
MUCH LIKE THE CRITICISM HE GAVE 
PRESIDENT OBAMA DURING THE 2020 
ELECTION AFTER HURRICANE SANDY. 
BACK THEN HE TWEETED ABOUT HOW 
PRESIDENT OBAMA CAMPAIGNED. 
QUOTE, WHILE HURRICANE SANDY 
VICTIMS ACROSS NEW YORK AND NEW 
JERSEY ARE STILL DECIMATED BY 
SANDY. 
DAVE LAWLER JOINS ME NOW FROM 
WASHINGTON. 
HE IS THE WORLD NEWS EDITOR OF 
AXIOS. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE 
PRESIDENT HOLDING A RALLY IN 
THE MIDDLE OF A DEVASTATING 
STORM LIKE THIS? 
>> THIS IS NOT A VISUAL THAT 
MANY POLITICIANS WOULD OPT FOR. 
IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY POLITICAL 
AT A TIME WHEN HE COULD BE 
SHOWING HIMSELF TO BE ABOVE 
POLITICS. 
I THINK IT'S MORE OF AN OPTICS 
ISSUE. 
SAY HIS TEAM IS IN PLACE TO 
RESPOND TO THIS STORM, AND HE 
TENDS TO THINK THAT IF YOU GET 
HIM IN FRONT OF A CROWD GOOD 
THINGS HAPPEN. 
SO HE HAS A DIFFERENT POLITICAL 
CALCULOUS THAN OTHER 
POLITICIANS DO? 
>> WHAT ABOUT FLORIDA GOVERNOR 
RICK SCOTT. 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS 
VARIOUS APPEARANCES AHEAD OF 
THIS STORM AS IT WAS 
APPROACHING THE STATE OF 
FLORIDA? 
>> SO TWO OF THE MOST CLOSELY 
WATCHED RACES IN THE COUNTRY 
RIGHT NOW ARE HAPPENING IN 
FLORIDA. 
YOU'VE GOT RICK SCOTT, WHO IS 
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA. 
HE'S BEEN ON TV ALMOST 
CONSTANTLY THE LAST FEW DAYS, 
GETTING THE WORD OUT ABOUT THIS 
HURRICANE AND WHAT PEOPLE NEED 
TO DO TO PREPARE FOR IT. 
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE RACE TO 
REPLACE RICK SCOTT HAS 
GOVERNOR, AND ANDREW GILLUM WHO 
IS THE MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE, 
WHICH IS IN THE PATH OF THIS 
STORM, HAS ALSO BEEN ON TV 
QUITE A BIT, TALKING ABOUT HIS 
PLANS TO RESPOND TO THE  STORM. 
YOU'VE GOT A REPUBLICAN IN ONE 
RACE ON TV. 
AND A DEMOCRAT IN ANOTHER RACE 
ON TV. 
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH 
OF THEM TO SHOW STRENGTH. 
>> IT'S INEXTRICABLY LINKED. 
THE PRESIDENT HAS ATTACKED 
DEMOCRATS' PLANS FOR 
HEALTHCARE. 
HE DID THIS WEDNESDAY IN A RARE 
OP-ED FOR U.S.A. 
TODAY. 
HE GOES ON TO PLEAD WITH VOTERS 
TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS FOR 
REPUBLICANS. 
SAYING QUOTE, IF DEMOCRATS WIN 
CONTROL OF CONGRESS THIS 
NOVEMBER, WE WILL COME 
DANGEROUSLY CLOSER TO SOCIALISM 
IN AMERICA. 
HOW TYPICAL IS THAT RHETORIC 
FROM A PRESIDENT JUST WEEKS 
AWAY FROM THE MIDTERMS? 
>> ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT THIS 
OP-ED IS IT REALLY DOESN'T 
STAND UP TO SCRUTINY FROM A 
FACTUAL STANCE. 
THE FACTS ON THE DEMOCRATS' 
PLANS FOR HEALTHCARE ARE NOT, 
YOU KNOW UP TO SNUFF. 
WHAT'S INTERESTING THOUGH, IS 
HEALTHCARE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE ADS ACROSS ALL THE MIDTERM 
RACES IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, 
HEALTHCARE IS THE NUMBER 1 
ISSUE THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT IN THEIR ADS. 
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT. 
REPUBLICANS ARE ON THE 
DEFENSIVE A LITTLE BIT. 
THEY MIGHT THINK THIS IS A 
BETTER ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS. 
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLEARLY 
SEEING THAT, AND GETTING HIS 
MESSAGE OUT. 
IT IS A RARE THING FOR HIM TO 
WRITE AN OP-ED. 
>> SO THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING 
MULTIPLE RALLIES THIS WEEK. 
ON TUESDAY, HE WAS INCOUNCIL 
BLUFFS, IOWA. 
LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HE SAID. 
>> A VOTE FOR US IS A VOTE FOR 
LESS REGULATION AND MORE 
PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE RIGHT 
HERE IN THE U.S.A. 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. 
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE 
AGAIN. 
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
>> ALL RIGHT, SO THE 
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE THERE SEEMS 
TO BE PRETTY CLEAR, THAT IF YOU 
VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS, THEY WILL 
HELP ME IN WASHINGTON. 
DO WE HAVE ANY SENSE? 
>> TRUMP BOOSTING THAT 
ENTHUSIASM GAP WITH DEMOCRATS 
IS A GOOD THING. 
THEN AGAIN, TRUMP IS NOT THE 
MOST POPULAR PRESIDENT IN THE 
WORLD. 
THEY THINK HIS APPROVAL RATING 
IS AT 43% RIGHT NOW. 
IF YOU'RE RUNNING IN A DISTRICT 
THAT'S REALLY A TOSS UP. 
YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE THIS 
RACE MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT 
YOU THINK ARE GOOD FOR YOU. 
THE ECONOMY. 
ABOUT TAXES. 
THE TAX CUTS. 
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP COMING TO TOWN AND MAKING 
THIS ALL ABOUT HIM, AND 
INJECTING EVEN MORE CONTROVERSY 
INTO THINGS. 
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ERIC 
HOLDER, WHO SAID THIS ON 
WEDNESDAY. 
QUOTE, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE 
KICK THEM. 
WHICH WAS OF COURSE, A PLAY ON 
MICHELLE OBAMA'S NOW FAMOUS 
WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO HIGH. 
THIS WAS FASCINATING TO ME. 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORMER 
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL. 
SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE TOP LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SAYING 
THIS. 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT 
ERIC HOLDER SORT OF TAKING THIS 
APPROACH AHEAD OF NOVEMBER, AND 
WHAT DO YOU THINK OTHER 
DEMOCRATS FEEL ABOUT THAT 
PARTICULAR TACTIC? 
>> SO WHEN I SAW THIS QUOTE POP 
UP IN MY TWITTER FEED, I HAD TO 
GO AND FIND THE CLIP, BECAUSE I 
WAS SO SHOCKED BY THE CLIP, I 
WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WERE 
GETTING IT RIGHT. 
THEY WERE GETTING IT RIGHT. 
ERIC HOLDER DID SAY THIS. 
THIS COMES AFTER HILLARY 
CLINTON SAID THAT THE TIME FOR 
CIVILITY IS OVER. 
WE HAVE TO WIN BACK THE 
MAJORITIES, AND FIGHT, FIGHT, 
FIGHT. 
AND THEN THERE CAN BE TIME FOR 
CIVILITY. 
THESE AREN'T PEOPLE COMING FROM 
THE OUTSIDE SAYING THE 
ESTABLISHMENT IS DOING IT 
WRONG. 
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT WHO 
IS SAYING THESE THINGS. 
IT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE.
IT GUESS IT SHOWS -- IF SO, 
IT'S GOING TO BE ANEVEN UGLIER 
POLITICAL CYCLE THAT WHAT WE'VE 
SEEN SO FAR. 
>> WHAT ELSE ARE WE SEEING FROM 
DEMOCRATS? 
AS WE'VE SEEN REPUBLICANS 
TRYING TO FIRE UP THEIR SIDE. 
>> IT VARIES. 
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE 
SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT TRUMP. 
WE RAN STRICTLY AGAINST TRUMP 
THE LAST TIME, AND WE LOST. 
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US. 
WHAT WE STAND FOR, AND THAT'S A 
DIFFERENT MESSAGE THAN WHAT 
WE'RE SEEING FROM PEOPLE. 
THERE'S ALSO JUST SO MUCH ANGER 
IN THE BASE. 
THERE ARE PEOPLE FURIOUS ABOUT 
WHAT'S HE HAPPENING IN THE 
COUNTRY AND WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
IS DOING. 
SO PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO 
THAT AS WELL. 
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 
TEST FOR PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY 
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020. 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF 
THESE PEOPLE WHO RUNS ANGRY. 
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF 
THOSE PEOPLE WHO RUNS WITH 
IDEAS? 
NOT THAT THOSE ARE MUTUALLY 
EXCLUSIVE, BUT I THINK THAT'S A 
DECISION PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO 
MAKE. 
>> LET'S TURN TO NIKKI HALEY. 
SHE ANNOUNCED HER PLANS TO 
RESIGN. 
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT HER 
DEPARTURE. 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR 
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN 
POLICY? 
>> FIRST OF ALL, HE'S GOT TO 
FIND A REPLACEMENT. 
MY PARTNERS AT AXIOS ARE 
REPORTING THAT DINA POWEL 
APPEARS TO BE THE FRONT-RUNNER 
IF SHE WANTS THE JOB. 
NIKKI HALEY IS AN INTERESTING 
CASE. 
SHE'S ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO 
SERVED IN IN ADMINISTRATION, 
AND CAME OUT WITH HER STAR 
BURNING BRIGHTER THAN WHEN SHE 
CAME INTO THE ADMINISTRATION. 
SHE'S SOMEONE WITH NATIONAL 
AMBITIONS. 
SHE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO BE ON 
THE BALLOT AT ANY LEVEL IN 
2020. 
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE 
PRESIDENT. 
>> REALLY FASCINATING TO SEE 
WHAT SHE WILL DO NEXT. 
DAVID LAWLER. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
>>> FEMA IS ROUNDING UP TROOPS 
TO SEND TO FLORIDA AND GEORGIA 
IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE 
MICHAEL. 
THE RECENT INCREASE OF NATIONAL 
DISASTERS IS PUTTING A STRAIN 
ON THE INDUSTRY. 
>> Reporter: AT FEMA 
HEADQUARTERS A FEW HUNDRED 
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY COORDINATING 
THE RESPONSE TO THIS HURRICANE. 
>> WE'RE PUSHING FORWARD. 
STORM SURGES, SEEING THE OCEAN 
RISE. 
>> Reporter: BROCK LONG SAYS 
THE IMAGES SUGGEST MONTHS OR 
YEARS OF RECOVERY FOR THE 
HARDEST HIT AREAS. 
>> INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO 
BE HEAVILY DAMAGED. 
>> Reporter: WE CAUGHT UP TO 
LONG AFTER HE BRIEFED THE 
PRESIDENT AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
>> SO THEY'RE REPORTING THAT 
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL HURRICANES EVER TO HIT 
OUR COUNTRY. 
IS THAT ACTUALLY A FACT? 
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, SO IN THIS 
AREA, THIS WOULD BE THE MOST 
INTENSE HURRICANE THAT'S STRUCK 
THIS AREA SINCE 1851. 
>> Reporter: FEMA HAS ABOUT 
3,000 EMPLOYEES IN THE FIELD. 
PLUS AIRCRAFT, AND SEARCH AND 
RESCUE TEAMS READY TO MOVE INTO 
BOTH FLORIDA AND GEORGIA. 
BUT WITH MORE THAN 60 SEVERE 
STORMS, AND HURRICANES OVER THE 
LAST TWO YEARS, FEMA IS UNDER 
CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE. 
>> IS FEMA STRETCHED THIN? 
>> YES, YOU START TO REACH A 
POINT WHERE THE INTERNAL CAPE 
COUNTY IS TO MANAGE NOT ONLY 
THE DAY-TO-DAY OF WHAT WE DO, 
BUT ALSO THE SHEER NUMBER OF 
DISASTERS. 
HOW INTENSE THESE DISASTERS 
HAVE BEEN OVER THE LAST YEAR 
AND A HALF. 
YEAH, IT STARTS TO PUT STRESS 
INSIDE THE AGENCY. 
>> Reporter: AND THAT IS 
MAGNIFIED BECAUSE 5 MONTHS INTO 
THE HURRICANE SEASON, SOME OF 
THE TOP JOBS AT FEMA HAVE YET 
TO BE FILLED. 
TODAY IN A BRIEFING, 
ADMINISTRATOR LONG EXPRESSED 
HIS FRUSTRATION THAT HIS DEPUTY 
HAD YET TO BE CONFIRMED, EVEN 
THOUGH HE WAS NOMINATED THIS 
PAST SUMMER. 
>> ELAINE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, 
HURRICANE MICHAEL HIT THE 
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY. 
NEARLY 30 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE 
SOUTHEAST WILL BE IMPACTED BY 
THIS TOMORROW. 
WHICH 
-- STORM. 
MARK DEMARIA IS CHIEF OF 
SCIENCE AT THE NATIONAL 
HURRICANE CENTER. 
HE JOINS ME NOW FROM MIAMI. 
LET'S START WITH THE LATEST ON 
MICHAEL. 
WHERE IS IT NOW, AND WHERE IS 
IT HEADED? 
>> RIGHT NOW, IT'S MOVED INTO 
SOUTHWEST GEORGIA, AND IT'S 
GOING TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE 
STATE OF GEORGIA, INTO SOUTH 
CAROLINA, AND NORTH CAROLINA, 
AND OUT TO SEA. 
WE'RE ALSO STILL SEEING FROM 
DOPPLER RADAR. 
WE'RE STILL SEEING WINDS UP TO 
100 MILES PER HOUR IN THE SMALL 
AREA NEAR THE CORE. 
SO MICHAEL IS NOT DONE YET. 
>> WHAT IS THE BIGGEST THREAT 
THEN GOING FORWARD? 
>> RIGHT NOW, THE THREAT IS 
STILL GOING TO BE FOR WIND 
ALONG THE NARROW PATH OF THE 
CENTER. 
THIS AREA OF GEORGIA IS HEAVILY 
WOODED. 
DOESN'T TAKE A LOT OF WIND TO 
KNOCK DOWN TREES AND CREATE 
POWER OUTAGES. 
WE STILL ANTICIPATE SOME WIND 
DAMAGE ALONG THE WAY. 
THAT ALONG WITH RAIN OF 4 TO 6 
INCHES ALONG THE PATH. 
>> IS IT UNUSUAL FOR A STORM TO 
STAY THIS POWERFUL THIS FAR 
INLAND? 
>> NO, A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB 
IS THAT A HURRICANE LOSES ABOUT 
HALF OF ITS INTENSITY IN TEN 
HOURS. 
BECAUSE THIS WENT IN AT 150 
MILES PER HOUR, IT CAN STAY A 
HURRICANE FOR UP TO TEN HOURS. 
AND MOVING PRETTY FAST, THOSE 
WINDS CAN PENETRATE VERY FAR 
INLAND. 
>> SO IT'S NOT OVER YET IS THE 
BOTTOM LINE. 
ALL RIGHT, MARK, THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
>> WELCOME. 
>>> WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 
BREAK. 
BEFORE WE DO, WE WANT TO LET 
YOU KNOW ABOUT AN EXCITING 
CHANGE COMING TO CBSN. 
BEGINNING ON MONDAY, OCTOBER 
15, WE ARE ADDING A NEW HOUR OF 
LIVE COVERAGE TO OUR LINEUP, 
BEGINNING AT 7:00 A.M. 
EASTERN, ANNE-MARIE GREEN, AND 
VLADIMIR DUTIER WILL BRING YOU 
THE NEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD 
WITH OUR GLOBAL TEAM OF 
CORRESPONDENTS. 
WE'LL ALSO DIG DEEP INTO THE 
STORIES THAT MATTER MOST TO 
YOU, WITH UNBIASED INSIGHTS, 
AND PERSPECTIVE. 
DON'T MISS ANNE-MARIE, AND VLAD 
FOR THE ALL NEW CBSN A.M. 
>>> AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, 
PANAMA CITY WAS IN THE DIRECT 
PATH OF HURRICANE MICHAEL. 
YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE DAMAGE 
WINDS DID THERE. 
ROOFS WERE RIPPED UP, AND TREES 
WERE BLOWN DOWN. 
WINDS WERE BLOWING IN ALL 
DIRECTIONS. 
HILLARY WHAT WERE THE 
CONDITIONS WHERE YOU ARE? 
>> Reporter: ELAINE IT IS 
LITERALLY THE CALL AFTER THE 
STORM. 
IT IS SO DIFFERENT COMPARED TO 
HOW IT WAS A FEW HOURS AGO. 
WE WERE NOT ABLE TO COME 
OUTSIDE DURING THE HEIGHT OF 
THE STORM, BECAUSE IT JUST 
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DANGEROUS. 
SO WE WATCHED FROM OUR HOTEL 
ROOM AS THE WINDS SNAPPED 
ACROSS THE AREA. 
THEY TOOK TONS OF PALM TREES 
DOWN. 
MANY SIGNS, AND COMPLETELY ON 
THE GROUND, AND WIRES AS WELL. 
TAKING POWER OUT ALL OVER THE 
AREA, AND WATER, THE RAIN JUST 
COMING DOWN IN BUCKETS. 
>> SO THERE'S NO POWER WHERE 
YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? 
>> Reporter: THAT'S CORRECT. 
CLOSE TO 200,000 PEOPLE IN THIS 
AREA ARE WITHOUT POWER. 
WE LOST POWER ACTUALLY BEFORE 
THE BRUNT, BEFORE THE EYE CAME 
THROUGH THIS AREA. 
THAT'S THE SIMILAR SITUATION 
FOR MANY PEOPLE. 
THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA HAS 
SAID THAT RESTORING POWER IS 
HIS NUMBER 1 PRIORITY. 
BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, 
ESPECIALLY AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO 
REBUILD. 
>> HILLARY, HAVE YOU SEEN 
PEOPLE OUT AND ABOUT AT ALL,OR 
FIRST RESPONDERS? 
>> RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE ARE 
STARTING TO GET OUT AND SURVEY 
THE DAMAGE. 
THIS ROAD HAS BEEN VERY QUIET. 
WE'RE STARTING TO SEE PEOPLE 
DRIVE BY. 
IT WAS VERY INTERESTING DURING 
THIS STORM, THE GOVERNOR SAID 
THAT EMERGENCY PERSONNEL WILL 
NOT BE RESCUING PEOPLE, BECAUSE 
IT WOULD BE PUTTING THEIR LIVES 
AT RISK. 
SO NOW WE KNOW THOSE EMERGENCY 
MANAGEMENT SERVICE GROUPS ARE 
OUT IN THE COMMUNITY, SURVEYING 
DAMAGE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT 
WHAT'S GOING ON. 
AS WE'RE DOING THAT, WE'RE ALSO 
NOTICING RESIDENTS ARE COMING 
OUT TO GET A SENSE OF HOW 
IMPACTFUL THE STORM WAS. 
>> HAVE YOU GOTTEN A CHANCE TO 
TALK TO FOLKS ABOUT HOW THIS 
MIGHT COMPARE TO OTHER STORMS 
THAT HAVE HIT THE AREA? 
>> Reporter: WE HAVE AND I 
THINK UNIVERSALLY PEOPLE ARE 
SAYING HOW QUICKLY THIS 
HAPPENED. 
THIS HURRICANE FORMED SO 
QUICKLY THAT BY THE TIME PEOPLE 
WERE GETTING THE MANDATORY 
EVACUATION ORDERS, THEY DIDN'T 
EVEN REALIZE THERE WAS A STORM 
AT ALL, AND THERE WASN'T A LOT 
OF TIME FOR THEM TO FIGURE OUT 
A PLAN TO BUY FOOD. 
THEY'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT HOW 
INTENSE THIS STORM WAS, BUT 
ALSO HOW FAST IT WAS. 
IT REALLY SURPRISED US TOO. 
THIS STORM CAME IN WITH SUCH 
INTENSITY, BUT IT ALSO LEFT 
VERY, VERY QUICKLY. 
>> I KNOW HILLARY PEOPLE ARE 
STILL TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON 
THE SEVERITY OF DAMAGE THERE. 
IS THERE ANY SENSE AT ALL FROM 
FOLKS WHAT THEIR BIGGEST 
CHALLENGES ARE GOING TO BE AS 
THEY TRY TO RECOVER? 
>> Reporter: WELL, JUST LIKE 
EVERY STORM, STRUCTURAL DAMAGE 
IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE 
VERY WORRIED ABOUT. 
WHEN YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH YOUR 
FOUNDATION, OR VERY EXPENSIVE 
REPAIRS SOME PEOPLE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT, THEY WORRY ABOUT THE 
COST OF THE STORM. 
THEY SAY IT'S A CONCERN DURING 
OTHER HURRICANES AS WELL. 
DOWNED POWER LINES AND TREES 
ARE ALSO A CONCERN FOR PEOPLE. 
JUST TOUGH SOMETIMES. 
IT TAKES DAYS SOMETIMES TO GET 
ALL OF THAT BACK UP AND RUNNING 
AGAIN.

CHRIS MARTINEZ REPORTS. 
>> Reporter: MYPELLY BURNS WAS 
BORN WITH CHRONIC ASTHMA. 
AN ATTACK JUST BEFORE HER 
SECOND BIRTHDAY WAS DIFFERENT. 
>> I CALLED MY FRIEND IF SHE 
CAN TAKE US TO THE EMERGENCY 
ROOM. 
>> Reporter: SHE APPEARED TO 
MAKE A FULL RECOVERY IN THE 
HOSPITAL. 
BUT WHEN SHE RETURNED HOME. 
>> HE WAS A -- SHE WAS PLAYING 
WITH A KID, AND MY HUSBAND 
NOTICED HER ARM WAS JUST 
HANGING THERE. 
>> Reporter: SHE WAS DIAGNOSED 
WITH ACUTE FLACCID MILOTTIS. 
SOME PATIENTS ARE LEFT 
PARALYZED. 
>> ABOUT HALF THE KIDS WITH AFM 
WILL STRENGTHEN UP ENOUGH ON 
THEIR OWN THAT THEY WON'T 
REQUIRE ANY FORM OF SURGICAL 
INTERVENTION FOR THEIR NERVES. 
THE OTHER HALF WON'T. 
>> Reporter: DR. MITCHELL 
SERULYA AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL 
LOS ANGELES IS PIONEERING NERVE

PATIENTS. 
DOCTORS TOOK NERVES FROM HER 
RIBS AND DIAPHRAGM, AND 
DIVERTED THEM TO HER ARM. 
>> YOU HAVE TO GET IN THERE BY 
8 TO 12 MONTHS, IDEALLY, TO FIX 
THE NERVE. 
OTHERWISE, THE NERVE LOSES ITS 
CONNECTION TO THE MUSCLE. 
AT THAT POINT, YOU RUN THE RISK 
OF NOT BEING ABLE TO REVERSE 
THE PARALYSIS. 
>> Reporter: THERAPISTS HAVE 
BEEN WORKING WITH MYPELLY. 
IT'S BEEN 18 MONTHS SINCE THE 
FIRST SURGERY. 
THE NOW 4-YEAR-OLD HAS REGAINED

GO UP THE STAIRS. 
WE TRY TO TREAT HER LIKE A 
NORMAL KID.

SHE CONTINUES WITH THERAPY, 
SHE'LL SEE EVEN MORE 
IMPROVEMENT. 
CHRIS MARTINEZ, CBS NEWS, LOS 
ANGELES. 
>>>WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR 
HURRICANE MICHAEL THROUGHOUT 
THE EVENING. 
STAY WITH CBSN FOR THE LATEST 
THROUGHOUT THIS DEADLY STORM. 
THIS WEDNESDAY
FROM THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE,
MICHAEL MAKES LANDFALL AND
HISTORY.
THE MOST POWERFUL HURRICANE EVER
TO HIT THIS REGION KNOCKS OUT
POWER AND CAUSES WIDESPREAD
DAMAGE.
WE HAVE A TEAM OF CORRESPONDENTS
PRODUCERS AND PHOTOJOURNALISTS
SPREAD ACROSS THE HURRICANE ZONE
TO BRING YOU EXTENSIVE COVERAGE
BEGINNING WITH THE HEADLINES IN
60 SECONDS.
>>> HURRICANE MICHAEL IS THE
HURRICANE OF THE WORST KIND.
>> A CATEGORY LANDFALL IN THE
MONTH OF OCTOBER.
>> THE ONE OF THE STRONGEST
STORMS EVER TO HIT AMERICA.
>> THIS STARTED OUT VERY
INNOCENTLY A WEEK AGO ASK WENT
TO A MONSTER.
>> LANDFALL WAS MADE NEAR MEXICO
BEACH FLORIDA.
>> MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS 155
MILES PER HOUR.
>> JUST TWO MILES PER HOUR AWAY
FROM A CATEGORY 5.
>> IS THIS GOING TO PRODUCE
CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE?
>> I DON'T THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE
HAVE LEFT.
>> THIS IS A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE
STORM.
>> THE WINDS ARE INKRED WHETHER
I STRONG.
>> THIS IS A BAD HURRICANE.
QUITS. GOING TO HAVE TO CALL IT-
>> I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE
STORM AND WE GOT OUT OF THERE
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT.
>>> GOOD EVENING.
THIS REGION JUST ENDURED ONE OF
THE WORST HURRICANES IN AMERICAN
HISTORY.
THE WORST HURRICANE TO EVER HIT
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE.
THE WORST HURRICANE TO EVER HIT
THE UNITED STATES IN THE MONTH
OF OCTOBER ON RECORD.
TONIGHT THE RAIN IS BASICALLY
GONE IN THIS REGION BUT THE WIND
IS STILL HERE WITH US.
YOU CAN SEE POWER LINES DOWN
BEHIND US.
POWER POLES DOWN JUST ACROSS THE
STREET HERE.
THERE IS THE SIDE RIPPED OFF A
BUILDING.
THAT IS A SCENE WE ARE SEEING
ALL ACROSS THIS REGION TONIGHT.
SOME OF THE WORST DAMAGE THIS
EVENING IS IN MEXICO BEACH.
HERE IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE IN
PANAMA CITY BEACH WHEN MICHAEL
MADE LANDFALL.
.
>> HOLY
>> AGAIN THAT WAS A LOOK AT
HURRICANE MICHAEL AS IT MADE
LANDFALL IN OUR AREA.
A HURRICANE WHICH HAS NOW TURNED
DEADLY.
HERE'S A LARGER LOOK AT THE DAY.
>> THE SOUND UNMISTAKABLE.
MORE LIKE A JET LINER AT
TAKEOFF.
>> OH MY GOD!
>> HERE IN PANAMA CITY
BEACH WE ARE NEAR THE CENTER OF
THE STORM AS IT BLASTED AWAY.
>> WE ARE NOW APPROACHING THE
WORST OF HURRICANE MICHAEL.
THE CITY MANAGER TELLS US HE
THINKS ABOUT 50% OF RESIDENTS
HAVE LEFT TOWN.
AT THIS POINT THEY ARE NO LONGER
RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS
AND IF SOMEONE HAS
LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY THEY
LIKELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET
THERE.
>> WHEN MICHAEL MADE LANDFALL
ITS WINDS TOPPED OUT AT 155
MILES PER HOUR.
MANY WIND GAUGES BROKE.
>> THIS IS WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE
RIGHT UP AGAINST PRETTY MUCH ALL
WINDOWS.
THE STORM TRIES TO PUSH THROUGH
AS BEST IT CAN.
>> IT WAS ENOUGH TO RIP ROOFTOPS
OFF
BUILDINGS.
>> RIGHT NOW WE ARE INSIDE THE
HOTEL WITH FLASHLIGHTS HUNKERED
DOWN DURING THE WORST OF THE
STORM.
GOING TO TRY TO GET BACK OUT
SIDE WHENEVER ITS SAFE TO ASSESS
THE DAMAGE.
>> JUST A FEW MILES TO THE EAST
OF PANAMA CITY BEACH LIES THE
TOURIST TOWN OF MEXICO BEACH
WHICH TOOK A DIRECT HIT.
MICHAEL APPEARED TO FLATTEN
EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH.
STORM SURGES UP TO 8 FEET AND
RAINFALL TOPPING 5 INCHES
SUBMERGED MANY HOUSES THERE.
OTHER BUILDINGS LAY IN PILES.
MICHAEL IS THE LOWEST PRESSURE
HURRICANE TO STRIKE THE U.S.
MAINLAND SINCE 1969.
NOTHING THIS FEROCIOUS HAS EVER
HIT THE PANHANDLE.
>> WE WANT TO BEGIN TO CHECK IN
WITH OUR CORRESPONDENT.
OMAR IS IN PORT SAINT JO.
THAT IS JUST NEXT TO MEXICO
BEACH WHERE LANDFALL HAPPENED.
OMAR, WHAT IS THE LATEST THERE
NOW?
>> HERE IN PORT SAINT JO THE
RAIN HAS STOPPED.
THAT IS THE GOOD NEWS.
WE ARE STILL GETTING A LITTLE
BIT OF WIND THIS THIS AREA.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO COME OUT
AND ASSESS THE DAMAGE.
IN THIS AREA HERE, THIS IS FLOOD
WATER THAT HAS COME UP IN THIS
AREA.
THERE IS A LOT OF DEBRIS LIKE
THIS SPREAD ALL AROUND THIS
AREA.
PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TRY TO
PICK IT UP CAUSE THE CLEAN UP IS
UNDERWAY.
HURRICANE MICHAEL SLAMMED INTO
PORT SAINT JO EARLIER THIS
AFTERNOON.
HEAVY RAINS AND TREE SNAPPING
WINDS PUMMELLED THE FLORIDA
PANHANDLE.
>> WHOA.
>> THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ROAD OUT
THE STORM AT HOME DESPITE BEING
TOLD TO GET OUT.
PORT AIN'T JO RESIDENTS WENT
INTO RESCUE MODE AFTER MICHAEL'S
12 FOOT STORM SURGE TRAPPED
PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES.
VOLUNTEERS IN SMALL BOATS AND
BIG TRUCKS PUSHED THROUGH
STREETS BLOCKED BY TREES AND
SUBMERGED IN SEVERAL FEET OF
WATER.
DONNA DID -- DIDN'T HAVE A WAY
TO CHECK ON HER FAMILY.
SHE USED OUR CELLPHONE TO HELP
WAS ON ITS WAY.
WITHIN MINUTES A BIG TRUCK
CARRIED THEM TO HIGHER GROUND.
>> HOW WAS THE WATER LEVELS?
>> UH, GOT UP TO FOUR FEET IN
THE HOUSE.
>> IN THE HOUSE?
>> IN THE HOUSE UP TO ABOUT MY
HIP.
>> THE DRIVER WAS A MAN NAMED
CHRIS.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO TALK AS
HE DROVE BACK TO HELP MORE
PEOPLE BUT HIS ACTIONS SAID
PLENTY IN THIS SMALL COMMUNITY.
>> WHERE WOULD THESE PEOPLE BE?
>> WHERE IS ANYBODY WITHOUT
FRIENDS?
>> VOLUNTEERS CAME OUT WITH
CHAIN SAWS WORKING TO CLEAR THE
STREETS OF DOWNED TREES.
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY
HURRICANE FORCED WINDS DAMAGED
BUILDINGS AND EVEN FLIPPED OVER
THIS RV.
AS PEOPLE ASSESS THE DAMAGE,
DONNA IS JUST THANKFUL SHE
SURVIVED ONE OF THE BIGGEST
HURRICANES TO HIT THE FLORIDA
PANHANDLE.
>> HOW WAS IT TO FINALLY SEE HIM
ON THE BACK OF THE TRUCK?
>> THAT WAS GOOD, GOOD.
WE CAN REST EASY NOW.
>> YOUR MENTIONED THE CELL
SERVICE BY THE WAY HAS BEEN OUT
FOR MT PEOPLE DOWN HERE FOR A
GOOD FIVE HOURS NOW.
THAT HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR
FOLKS WHO WANT TO CHECK IN ON
LOVED ONES TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE
OKAY.
OMAR, TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT
THOSE RESCUES IF YOU COULD AND
WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN TODAY.
>> WHEN WE PULLED UP ON THIS
AREA THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE
WATER UP HERE.
JEFF PITS, THE GENTLEMAN WE
TALKED TO, THAT IS HIS HOUSE
BACK THERE.
YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A RED TRUCK
IN THE DRIVEWAY.
THERE IS A TREE THAT'S TOPPLED
OVER ON HIS HOUSE.
HE WAS TELLING US HE HAD FOUR
FEET OF WATER INSIDE.
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW
FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO LIVE OVER
THERE, THEY WERE COMING UP TO
US.
WE JUST HAPPENED TO HAVE A
CELLPHONE THAT HAD ONE BAR.
THAT IS HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO
GET AHOLD OF JEFF.
YOU CAN SEE OVER HERE THERE IS
ONE OF THESE BIG TALL, BEAUTIFUL
PINE TREES THAT ARE OVER HERE IN
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE.
PROBLEM IS WHEN A HURRICANE
COMES IN, THEY SNAP AND THEY ARE
SO TALL ANY POWER LINE THAT IS
AROUND IT, THEY ARE BRINGING
DOWN WITH IT.
THAT IS ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES
AROUND HERE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE CHAIN SAWS
READY TO GO IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL GET SOME
POWER UP.
THEY UNDERSTAND STAND IT -- IT
IS
GOING TO BE A LONG PROCESS FOR
ELEK
E -- ELECTRICITY FOR THIS
PROCESS AND CLEAN UP.
>> I WANT TO TALK TO LONI, CHIEF
WEATHER CASTER.
I KNOW YOU HAVE ALL BEEN AMAZED
AT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
HURRICANE MICHAEL AND WHAT HAS
HAPPENED HERE.
HOW DOES SOMETHING GO FROM A
TROPICAL STORM TO A NEARLY
CATEGORY 5 IN THE SPAN OF 72
HOURS.
>> IT JUST BUMPED UP SO QUICKLY.
THERE WERE ELEMENTS OUT THERE
THAT COULD HAVE BEATEN IT UP A
LITTLE BIT.
DID NOT HAPPEN.
HERE IS YOUR CURRENT SITUATION
OUT THERE.
SORRY THIS IS YOUR LANDFALL
PICTURE.
YOU SEE HOW MEXICO BEACH TOOK
THE WORST OF THE EYE WALL.
PANAMA BEACH OVER TO LAGUNA
BEACH.
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE EYE WALL
VERY STRONG BUT PUSHING THE
WATER OUT AWAY FROM THE
SHORELINE.
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE
ARE DEALING WITH AS OF RIGHT
NOW, YOU HAVE A STORM THAT IS
INTO GEORGIA.
EVERYBODY ASKED THE SAME
QUESTION THAT JEFF IS ASKING,
HOW?
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?
WHAT ELEMENTS CAME TOGETHER?
WELL HERE IS THE DEAL.
YOU HAD WARM WATER, NOTHING BUT
FUEL IN FRONT OF THIS SYSTEM FOR
IT TO FEED ON.
WE THOUGHT IT WOULD MAYBE PULL A
LITTLE BIT OF DRY AIR.
IT NEVER MIXED IN THAT WAY.
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.
YOU HAD RAPID INTENSIFICATION.
IT NEVER INTERACTED.
IT JUST DIDN'T HAPPEN.
YOU ENDED UP WITH A NEARLY CAT 5
LAND FALL.
THE STRONGEST STORM IN THAT
AREA, ABOUT THE THIRD STRONGEST
STORM THE U.S. HAS EVER HAD AS
FAR AS MAINLAND LANDFALL.
THIS IS THE WORST I HAVE SEEN SO
FAR.
THOSE ARE TOPS OF HOUSES OUT
THERE.
LOOK AT ALL THAT DESTRUCTION.
IT SHOULD BE EXITING SOMEWHERE
ALONG THE CHESAPEAKE.
>> THAT'S A CONCERN AS WELL,
RIGHT?
>> EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT THE
EXACT SAME THING.
LOOK AT THE FORECASTED RAINFALL
TOTALS.
THESE ARE NOT ENORMOUS LIKE WHAT
THEY PICKED UP EARLIER.
TO YOU -- SOLE FALL SOME FOLKS
HAVEN'T EVEN
DRIED UP YET.
NEW YORK CITY COULD BE SEEING A
1 TO 3 INCH RANGE TOMORROW.
WE HAVE FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS IN
PLACE FOR THE CITY BECAUSE OF
THIS STORM.
IT IS NOT COMING TO NEW YORK
CITY, STAYS OFFSHORE BUT A LOT
OF RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
JEFF.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AGAIN WE WILL CHECK IN NOW WITH
NICKY.
SHE IS IN BRISTOL, FLORIDA.
IT IS ABOUT 60 MILES INLAND
WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE, HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TAKE ON FOR
SHELTER.
>> THE SURGE IS WHAT SCARED ME.
>> THESE LIFE-THREATENING STORM
SURGES IN FRANKLIN COUNTY LED
DOWN SEEK SHELTER HERE 60 MILES
AWAY.
>> IF THE SURGE HITS AS HIGH AS
THEY THINK, 13 FEET POSSIBLY,
WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO YOUR
HOUSE?
>> IT WOULD PROBABLY BE HALF WAY
UP THE FIRST FLOOR.
>> THE MESSAGE HERE IS CLEAR,
GET OUT NOW OR RISK YOUR LIFE.
>> WE SOON EVACUATED THE AREA
TOO.
WE JUST HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE THE
STORM IS COMING IN FAST AND
FURIOUS.
WE ARE DRIVING ABOUT AN HOUR
AWAY FROM HERE TO FIND SOME
SHELTER SO WE CAN STAY SAFE AS
THIS HURRICANE HITS LAND.
>> WE WATCHED THE HURRICANE HIT
FROM THESE WINDOWS.
IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO STEP
OUTSIDE.
OUR TEAM SOUGHT SAFETY WITH MORE
THAN 200 FLORIDIANS AT THIS
SCHOOL INLAND.
>> WHEN THEY SAID IT WAS A
CATEGORY 3 BECOMING A 4, I SAID
LETS GO.
>> SHE SAID A TREE FELL ON HER
MOBILE HOME AND THE POWER WENT
OUT.
THE THOUGHT STILL SCARES HER
4-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER DANNY.
>> I WAS JUST CRYING.
>> YOU ARE HERE, YOUR FAMILY IS
SAFE.
WHAT TO -- DO YOU STAND TO LOSE
BACK HOME?
>> NOTHING JUST MATERIAL THINGS
THAT CAN BE REPLACED.
>> DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR
SHELTER ARE THESE DOWNED TREES
AND POWER LINES.
THIS IS GOING TO MAKE IT MUCH
MORE DIFFICULT TO PEOPLE TO GET
HOME AND TO SEE IF THEIR HOUSES
ARE STILL STANDING.
JEFF.
>> THANKS VERY MUCH.
A TENSE FRIGHTENING AFTERNOON
FOR SO MANY PEOPLE HERE IN
FLORIDA.
EVEN MORE SO TONIGHT BECAUSE
CELL SERVICE IS NOT COMING IN.
WE HAVE NOW LEARNED THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE WILL BE
VISITING THIS AREA ON EITHER
SUNDAY OR MONDAY.
JEFF HAS BEEN WATCHING THE
FEDERAL RESPONSE ALL DAY AT FEMA
HEADQUARTERS.
>> AT FEMA HEADQUARTERS A FEW
HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE ALREADY
COORDINATING THE RESPONSE.
>> IT IS DOING WHAT THE
FORECASTERS WERE PUSHING
FORWARD.
STORM SURGE, YOU ARE SEE THE
OCEAN RISE.
>> FEMA ADMINISTRATOR SAID THE
IMAGES SUGGEST MONTHS OR YEARS
OF RECOVERY FOR THE HARDEST HIT
AREAS.
>> POWER WILL BE OUT FOR WEEKS.
INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE HEAVILY
DAMAGED.
>> WE CAUGHT UP TO LONG AFTER HE
BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT AT THE
WHITE HOUSE.
>> SO THEY ARE REPORTING THAT
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
HURRICANES EVER TO HIT OUR
COUNTRY.
IS THAT A FACT?
>> UM, WELL -- YOU KNOW SO -- IN
THIS AREA, THIS WOULD BE THE
MOST INTENSE HURRICANE THAT
STRUCK THIS AREA SINCE 1851
THERE FEMA HAS ABOUT 3,000
EMPLOYEES IN THE FIELD PLUS
AIRCRAFT AND SEARCH AND RESCUE
TEAMS READY TO MOVE IN TO BOTH
FLORIDA AND GEORGIA.
BUT WITH MORE THAN 60 SEVERE
STORMS AND HURRICANES OVER THE
LAST TWO YEARS, FEMA IS UNDER
CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE.
>> IS FEMA STRETCHED THIN?
>> YES, YOU START TO REACH A
POINT WHERE THE INTERNAL
CAPABILITIES TO MANAGE NOT THE
ONLY DAY TO DAY MISSION OF WHAT
WE DO BUT ALSO -- THE NUMBER
OF -- THE SHEER NUMBER OF
DISASTERS, BUT HOW INTENSE THESE
DISASTERS HAVE BEEN OVER THE
LAST YEAR AND A HALF.
>> AND THAT IS MAGNIFIED FIVE
MONTHS INTO THE HURRICANE
SEASON.
THERE IS A LOT OF TOP JOBS HERE
AT FEMA THAT HAVE YET TO BE
FILLED.
DURING A BRIEFING ADMINISTRATOR
LONG EXPRESSED HIS FRUSTRATION
THAT HIS DEPUTY HAD YET TO BE
CONFIRMED EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
NOMINATED THIS PAST SUMMER.
JEFF.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE
FROM THE HURRICANE ZONE COMING
UP IN THE BROADCAST.
ALSO COMING UP TONIGHT THERE HAS
BEEN AN ARREST MADE IN A PLOT TO
BLOW UP A BOMB IN D.C. ON
ELECTION DAY.
WE ARE BACK RIGHT AFTER THIS.
56-YEAR-OLD MAN
FROM NEW YORK WAS CHARGED TODAY
WITH MAKING A HUGE BOMB AS PART
OF A PLOT TO BLOW HIMSELF UP IN
WASHINGTON D.C. ON ELECTION DAY.
>> FBI AGENTS TODAY CONTINUED
SEARCHING A HOME JUST NORTH OF
NEW YORK CITY.
YESTERDAY THEY DISCOVERED A 200
POUND BOMB.
>> PROSECUTORS SAY PAUL
ROSENFELD PLANNED TO DETONATE
THAT BOMB IN WASHINGTON D.C. ON
ELECTION DAY.
HE ALLEGEDLY WANTED TO KILL
HIMSELF AND DRAW ATTENTION TO
HIS POLITICAL BELIEFS.
OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS
ACCORDING TO COURT PAPERS
ROSENFELD ALLEGEDLY SENT LETTERS
AND TEXT MESSAGES TO A
PENNSYLVANIA RESIDENT DETAILING
HIS PLAN TO DETONATE THE BOMB TO
DRAW ATTENTION TO THE POLITICAL
THEORY THAT ADVOCATES THE RANDOM
SELECTION OF GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS.
THE PENNSYLVANIA RESIDENT
ALERTED THE FBI AND POLICE
PULLED ROSENFELD OVER TUESDAY.
HE TOLD AGENTS HE ORDERED LARGE
QUANTITIES OF BLACK POWDER
ONLINE, BUILT SMALL TEST
EXPLOSIVES.
-- HE SAID HE
INSTALLED CERTAIN COMPONENTS IN
THE DEVICE TO ENSURE HE WAS
KILLED IN THE BLAST.
FBI TECHNICIANS REMOVED THE BOMB
FROM HIS BASEMENT AND
TRANSFERRED IT TO A SAFE
LOCATION.
>> THOSE COVER THE WATER FRONT
OF THE FULL RANGE OF EXTREMIST
IDEOLOGIES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN.
>> ROSENFELD MADE HIS FIRST
COURT APPEARANCE IN FEDERAL
COURT IN NEW YORK EARLIER TODAY.
THE FBI SAYS IT DOES NOT BELIEVE
HE'S PART OF ANY LARGER
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
IF HE'S CONVICTED HE FACES UP TO
20 YEARS IN PRISON.
JEFF.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
COMING UP HERE, NEW VIDEO OF THE
HIT SQUAD THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY
SENT TO KILL A WASHINGTON POST
CONTRIBUTOR.
THE OPERATOR OF
THE LIMOUSINE COMPANY INVOLVED
IN LAST WEEKEND'S DEADLY CRASH
WAS ARRESTED TODAY.
20 PEOPLE WERE KILLED INCLUDING
THE DRIVER WHO KID NOT HAVE THE
PROPER LICENSE TO OPERATE THAT
LIMO.
THE DRIVER'S WIDOW TALKED TO CBS
NEWS.
>> DID HE EVER COMPLAIN ABOUT
VEHICLES?
>> HE DID.
HE DID COMPLAIN.
>> WHAT DID HE SAY?
>> THERE WERE A FEW TIMES WHEN
HE TOLD ME BUT I OVERHEARD HIM
SAY I'M NOT GOING DRIVE THIS
LIKE THIS.
YOU NEED TO GIVE ME ANOTHER CAR.
>> FEDERAL DOCUMENTS SHOW THE
LIMO FAILED AN INSPECTION LAST
MONTH AND WAS NOT PROPERLY
REGISTERED.
>>> THE DOW FELL MORE THAN 800
POINTS.
INVESTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE
ECONOMIC FALL OUT FROM RISING
INTEREST RATES AND TRADE TENSION
WITH CHINA.
COMING UP NEXT HERE, MORE FROM
THE HURRICANE ZONE.
WE ARE BACK NOW
FROM PANAMA BEACH FLORIDA.
MANY WILL BE SPENDING THE NIGHT
IN THE DARK.
ITS ESTIMATED ABOUT 300,000
HOMES AND BUSINESSES LOST
ELECTRICITY.
AT THE HEIGHT OF IT ONE RESIDENT
SAID WE ARE CATCHING SOME
EXPECTED TO MAINTAIN HURRICANE
STRENGTH THROUGH AT LEAST
TONIGHT.
FLASH FLOOD WATCHES UP IN
ALABAMA AND GEORGIA AS WELL.
THE ONE PIECE OF GOOD NEWS WE
HAVE SEEN, THE SUN FINALLY
STARTING TO START
POKE THROUGH IN ONE SPOT
TONIGHT.
WE WILL KEEP WATCHING.
GOOD NIGHT FROM FLORIDA.
THERE IS A UNIQUE
POWER IN TRUTH.
>> WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THE
PEOPLE WHO COULD DO SOMETHING?
>> AND WHETHER THE STORY IS
AROUND THE GLOBE, ACROSS THE
NATION OR DOWN STREET.
>> LOOK AT THIS.
>> WE WILL FIND IT.
>> IT AMAZES ME YOU WERE ABLE TO
SEE HOUR HOUSE DESTROYED AND YOU
WENT RIGHT BACK TO WORK.
>> I WOULD RATHER BE OUT THERE
HELPING.
>> EVERY EVENING WE WANT TO PUT
THE POWER OF TRUTH IN YOUR
HANDS.
>> ORIGINAL REPORTING.
THE WINDS ARE
FEROCIOUS GUSTING ABOVE 120
MILES PER HOUR.
>> THE ISLAND IS STILL
STRUGGLING TO RECOVER.
AND MANY ARE WONDERING IF IT
EVER WILL.
PUERTO RICO IS IN THE THROES OF
AN EXODUS THAT IS DRAINING THE
ISLAND OF ITS MOST -- RESOURCE,
ITS PEOPLE.
>> THE MOST OBVIOUS SIDE
EXODUS -- SIGN IS THE NUMBER OF
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN SHUTDOWN.
>>
>> THE MAGNITUDE OF MARIA WAS
SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY HARD
TO PLAN FOR.
I WILL DIE TRYING TO MAKE SURE
THAT PUERTO RICO BECOMES A PLACE
WHERE WE CAN HAVE OPPORTUNITY.

E E --
FOUR
CALIFORNIA MEN ARE FACING
FEDERAL CHARGES FOR
PARTICIPATING IN LAST YEAR'S
WHITE NATIONALIST RALLY IN
CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE
MEN ARE SERIAL RIOTERS.
THEY ARE ACCUSED OF TRAVELING
FROM CALIFORNIA WITHIN INTENTION
OF PROMOTING AND STARTING A
RIOT.
EACH DEFENDANT FACES UP TO TEN
YEARS IN PRISON IF CONVICTED.
>>> THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS
CHARGING A CHINESE INTELLIGENCE
OFFICER FOR ALLEGEDLY TRYING TO
STEAL TRADE SECRETS FROM U.S.
AEROSPACE COMPANIES.
SHE WAS ARRESTED IN BELGIUM
EARLIER THIS YEAR AND EXTRADITED
TO CINCINNATI.
U.S. OFFICIALS SAY THIS IS THE
FIRST TIME IN RECENT HISTORY A
CHINESE INTEL OFFICIAL HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO THE U.S. TO FACE
PROSECUTION.
ONE OF THE COMPANIES ALLEGEDLY
TARGETED WAS GE AVIATION.
IN A STATEMENT THE COMPANY SAID
IN PART QUOTE NO SENSITIVE
INFORMATION RELATING TO MILITARY
PROGRAMS WAS TARGETED OR
OBTAINED.
>>> THE GASTON COUNTY SHERIFF'S
OFFICE SAYS ONE PERSON HAS BEEN
KILLED BY A FALLING TREE IN
NORTHWEST FLORIDA AS A RESULT OF
HURRICANE MICHAEL.
THE STORM MADE LANDFALL AS THE
STRONGEST STORM TO HIT THE
FLORIDA PANHANDLE WEDNESDAY AND
WAS THE THIRD STRONGEST
HURRICANE TO EVER HIT THE
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES.
WITH WIND SPEEDS TOPPING 155
MILES PER HOUR POWER WAS OUT FOR
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
>>> WE WILL HAVE MORE ON FEMA'S
STORM RESPONSE
>>> PLUS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
TRASHING DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR
MEDICARE FOR ALL AS HE LOOKS TO
PAINT THEM EXTREME AHEAD OF THE
MIDTERMS.
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN.
AMERICA'S NEXT
BIG ELECTION IS ON NOW.
JEFF TAKES YOU TO THE KEY STATES
TO SEE WHAT VOTERS ARE SAYING
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR NATION.
>> LET ME GO AROUND THE TABLE
QUICKLY.
>> THE BATTLEGROUND STATES,
SPECIAL REPORTS ON THE CBS
EVENING NEWS.
>>> DAVE JOINS ME NOW FROM
WASHINGTON.
HE'S THE WORLD NEWS EDITOR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THE
PRESIDENT HOLDING A RALLY IN THE
MIDDLE OF DEVASTATING STORM LIKE
THIS?
>> THIS IS NOT A VISUAL THAT
MANY POLITICIANS WOULD OPT FOR.
IT IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY POLITICAL
EVENT.
I THINK ITS MORE OF AN OPTICS
ISSUE.
HE WILL SAY HIS TEAM IS IN PLACE
TO RESPOND TO THIS STORM AND HE
TENDS TO THINK THAT IF YOU GET
HIM UP IN FRONT OH OF A CROWD
GOOD THINGS HAPPEN.
>> WHAT ABOUT FLORIDA GOVERNOR
RICK SCOTT?
HE IS RUNNING FOR THE U.S.
SENATE.
THIS NOVEMBER.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HIS
VARIOUS APPEARANCES AHEAD OF
THIS STORM AS IT WAS APPROACHING
THE STATE OF FLORIDA.
>> SO TWO OF THE MOST CLOSELY
WATCHED RACES IN THE COUNTRY
RIGHT NOW ARE HATCHING IN
FLORIDA.
YOU HAVE RICK SCOTT WHO IS THE
GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA.
HE'S BEEN ON TV ALMOST CONSTANT
THINK LAST FEW DAYS GETTING THE
WORD OUT ABOUT THIS HURRICANE
AND WHAT PEOPLE NEED TO DO TO
PREPARE FOR IT.
THEN YOU HAVE GOT THE RACE TO
REPLACE RICK SCOTT AS GOVERNOR
IN ANDREW WHO IS THE MAYOR YOUR
OF TALLAHASSEE WHICH IS IN THE
PATH OF THIS STORM.
HAS ALSO BEEN ON TV QUITE A BIT
TALKING ABOUT HIS PLANS TO
RESPOND TO THE STORM.
YOU HAVE GOT A REPUBLICAN IN ONE
RACE ON TV, YOU HAVE A DEMOCRAT
IN THE OTHER RACE ON TV.
THIS IS ON OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH
OF THEM TO SHOW LEADERSHIP, TO
úA
FEW WEEKS AWAY NOW FROM RACES
THAT LOOK LIKE TOSS UPS.
>> IT SORT OF LINKED WHATEVER WE
SEE HERE.
WELL THE PRESIDENT HAS ATTACKED
DEMOCRATS PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE.
HE DID THIS WEDNESDAY IN A RARE
OP-ED FOR USA TODAY.
HE SAID QUOTE IF DEMOCRATS WIN
CONTROL OF CONGRESS THIS NO,
MA'AM -- NOVEMBER WE WILL COME
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO SOCIALISM.
>> ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT THIS
IS IT DOESN'T STAND UP TO
SCRUTINY FROM A FACTUAL STAND
POINT.
THERE IS ALL SORTS OF FACT
CHECKS AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.
NEARLY EVERY PARAGRAPH CONTAINED
FALSE OR MISLEADING INFORMATION.
THE FACTS ON THE -- DEMOCRATS
PLANS FOR HEALTH CARE ARE NOT UP
TO SNUFF.
WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT
HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE
ADS ACROSS ALL THE MIDTERM RACES
IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, HEALTH
CARE IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE
THAT PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT
AND N THEIR ADS.
VOTERS CARE ABOUT IT.
REPUBLICANS ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE
A LITTLE BIT.
THEY MIGHT THINK THIS IS A
BETTER ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS AND
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CLEARLY
SEEING THAT AND GETTING HIS
MESSAGE OUT.
>> THE PRESIDENT IS HOLDING
MULTIPLE RALLIES THIS WEEK.
>> A VOTE FOR US IS A VOTE FOR
LOWER TAXES, LESS REGULATION AND
MORE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE
RIGHT HERE IN THE USA.
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING.
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG
AGAIN.
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN!
>> ALL RIGHT SO THE PRESIDENT'S
MESSAGE THERE SEEMS TO BE PRETTY
CLEAR THAT IF YOU VOTE FOR
REPUBLICANS, THEY WILL HELP ME
IN WASHINGTON.
TO WE HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW
AFFECTIVE THAT PARTICULAR
STRATEGY MIGHT BE?
>> IT VARIES QUITE A BIT RACE TO
RACE.
IF YOU ARE ONE OF THESE
REPUBLICANS WHO IS RUNNING IN A
PRO-TRUMP DISTRICT BUT FACING A
TOUGH CHALLENGE, THERE IS LOTS
OF THEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
TRUMP COMING INTO TOWN BOOSTING
TURN UP, TRYING TO CLOSE THAT
ENTHUSIASM GAP WITH DEMOCRATS IS
A GOOD THING.
THEN AGAIN TRUMP IS NOT THE MOST
POPULAR PRESIDENT IN THE WORLD.
IF YOU ARE RUNNING IN A DISTRICT
THAT IS REALLY TOSS UP, YOU
MIGHT WANT TO MAKE THIS RACE
MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT YOU
THINK ARE GOOD FOR YOU.
THE ECONOMY, ABOUT TAXES, THE
TAX CUTS.
YOU MIGHT NOT WANT PRESIDENT
TRUMP COMING TO TOWN AND MAKING
THIS ALL ABOUT HIM AND INJECTING
EVEN MORE CONTROVERSY INTO
THINGS.
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT ERIC
HOLDER WHO SAID THIS ON
WEDNESDAY.
QUOTE, WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE KICK
THEM.
WHICH WAS OF COURSE A PLAY ON
MICHELLE OBAMA'S FAMOUS QUOTE
WHEN THEY GO LOW WE GO HIGH.
THIS WAS FASCINATING TO ME
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FORMER
UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL,
SOMEBODY WHO WAS THE TOP LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SAYING
THIS.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT --
ERIC HOLDER TAKERING THIS A TAKE
-- TAKING THIS
APPROACH AHEAD OF NOVEMBER?
>> WHEN I SAW THIS QUOTE POP UP
IN MY TWITTER FEED I HAD TO GO
AND FIND THE CLIP BECAUSE I WAS
SO SHOCKED BY THE QUOTE I WANTED
TO MAKE SURE THIS PEOPLE WERE
GETTING IT RIGHT.
THEY WERE GETTING IT RIGHT.
ERIC HOLDER DID SAY THIS.
THIS IS COMES AFTER HILLARY
CLINTON SAID AT THAT THE TIME
FOR CIVILITY IS OVER, WE HAVE TO
WIN BACK THE MAJORITIES AND
FIGHT, FIGHT,FIGHT AND THEN
THERE CAN BE TIME FOR CIVILITY.
THIS IS THE ESTABLISHMENT WHOSE
SAYING THESE THINGS.
ITS PRETTY INCREDIBLE.
I GUESS IT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE
THINK THE MORAL HIGH GROUND IS
ONLY WORTH SO MUCH.
YOU KNOW THEY ARE TIRED OF
LOSING.
THIS IS KIND OF THE MICHAEL
SCHOOL OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.
HE'S BEEN SNIPING FROM THE
FRINGES AND SAYING WE NEED TO
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE.
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO' IF --
INTERESTING TO SEE IF THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE ON THE BALLOT WILL TAKE
UP THE MESSAGE.
>> BECAUSE WHAT ELSE ARE WE
SEEING FROM DEMOCRATS WHO ARE
TRYING TO OBVIOUSLY FIRE UP
THEIR BASE AS WE HAVE SEEN
REPUBLICANS TRYING TO FIRE UP
THEIR SIDE?
>> IT VARIES.
YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS OUT THERE WHO
ARE SAYING THIS ISN'T ABOUT
TRUMP.
WE RAN STRICTLY AGAINST TRUMP
LAST TIME AND WE LOST.
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS ABOUT US,
WHAT WE STAND FOR.
THERE ALSO SO MUCH ANGER IN THE
BASE.
PEOPLE ARE FURIOUS ABOUT WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY AND
WHAT THE PRESIDENT IS DOING.
PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THAT AS
WELL.
SO I THINK ITS GOING TO BE A
TEST FOR PEOPLE PARTICULARLY
LOOKING AHEAD TO 2020.
ARE YOU GOING TO BE ONE OF THESE
PEOPLE WHO RUNS ANGRY OR WHO
RUNS WITH IDEAS?
I THINK IT IS A CHOICE THAT
DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE TO MAKE.
>> LETS TURN TO ANOTHER ISSUE
HERE.
NIKKI HALEY RESIGNED TUESDAY AS
AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N. OR SHE
ANNOUNCED HER PLANS TO RESIGN.
SHE'S NOT LEAVING TILL TEND OF
THE YEAR.
YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT HER
DEPARTURE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FOREIGN
POLICY?
>> FIRST OF ALL HE HAS TO FIND A
REPLACEMENT.
MY COLLEAGUES ARE REPORTING THAT
POWELL, SHE WAS THE DEPUTY
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.
SHE LEFT THE ADMINISTRATION.
SHE APPEARS TO BE THE FRONT
RUNNER IF SHE WANTS THE JOB.
BUT ALSO YOU KNOW NIKKI HALEY IS
AN INTERESTING CASE.
SHE IS ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE WHO
SERVED IN THIS ADMISSION
STRAIGHT AND CAME OUT WITH HER
STAR BURNING BRIGHTER.
THE PART OF WHAT PEOPLE IN TRUMP
WORLD WANTED TO DO WAS DAMP DOWN
THE IDEA SHE WAS GOING TO BE
CHALLENGING PRESIDENT TRUMP.
SHE DID THAT HERSELF.
>> REALLY FASCINATING TO SEE
WHAT SHE WILL DO NEXT.
DAVID, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
YOUR TIME.
>> THANK YOU.
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP APPEARED TO
MOCK THE ME TOO MOVEMENT DURING

REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL

>> PENNSYLVANIA HASN'T BEEN WON
FOR MANY YEARS BY REPUBLICANS
BUT EVERY REPUBLICAN THINKS THEY
WILL WIN PENNSYLVANIA.

I GOT IT.
EVERY REPUBLICAN -- I USE AN
EXPRESSION, THERE IS AN
EXPRESSION BUT -- UNDER THE
RULES OF ME TOO, I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO USE THAT EXPRESSION ANYMORE.
I CAN'T DO IT.
ITS THE PERSON THAT GOT AWAY.
IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
PENNSYLVANIA -- HE SAID DO IT
ANYWAY.
I WOULD DO IT EXCEPT FOR THESE
PEOPLE UP THERE.
THEY WOULD SAY DID YOU HEAR WHAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID?
DID YOU HEAR WHAT HE SAID?
SO THERE IS AN EXPRESSION BUT WE
WILL CHANGE THE EXPRESSION.
PENNSYLVANIA WAS ALWAYS THE
PERSON THAT GOT AWAY.
>> FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP IS
ALSO WEIGHING IN ON THE
MOVEMENT.
IN AN INTERVIEW TAPED DURING HER
TRIP TO AFRICA PART OF WHAT WAS
AIRED WEDNESDAY, SHE SAID WOMEN
MUST PRESENT EVIDENCE IF THEY
