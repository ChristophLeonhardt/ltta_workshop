well on Thursday but that didn't happen there was a rocket failure so the crew had to make an emergency landing some 700 kilometers or so away from the Baikonur cosmodrome and I have as I've said Alex F Chinon right here with me just to warn you I will be speaking in Russian the interview will be in Russian but of course we do have a translator standing by for you so we can now begin I think so alexei nicolayevitch ballets thank you so much for joining us today so what was happening aboard the Soyuz when the launch went wrong well the situation became an emergency when all the states by the emergency signals blinking and we instantly realized what had happened and from then on it was the automatics of the spacecraft and we were doubling its activities as the coup so we started getting the first pictures when we had the live broadcasts during the launch moments when we saw that the capsules you were in in was shaking heavily and the signal was there was a disruption in the signal was this exactly the time when you realize or was it something nominal at that stage when everything goes according to plan when the first stage is detached there's always this kind of vibration that you can see on video images that's normal but after the first stage detached we felt that those vibrations continued and then immediately there was the emergency signal going off and we realized that this was this was an emergency so when that system went off and when you saw the lights blinking indicating there was a failure it was it's your second flights boys the first thought that came to your mind so you know you've trained for 10 years you've been prepared for it but what was your the first thing that came to your mind what was the first idea well once we had the emergency signal we realized that this flight will have to be aborted and that we'll have to go down by a ballistic trajectory you said that it was all done automated and so you just kept track of what was happening so you were the commander of the pair what depends on you like I said after the emergency would signal them the emergency rescue system automatically switched on in depending on which stage of the launch the emergency happens and there are three stages on all the emergency rescue system works according to a certain algorithm at the moment of the emergency during our lives the mast cueing the carrier rockets it had been detached already but the boosters were still there which continued to work after the emergency and after the the pod separated and there was the emergency separation from the boosters then the various parts of the module separated from each other and then the cyclic Graham went in and the pods went into a landing according to a ballistic trajectory the coup controls the this signal system and we have a handle called ruse which we have to use to give certain commands to double the activities of the automatic emergency system and that's what we were doing in accordance with the drills and everything went in accordance with with how with the contingency plans so there was this ballistic trajectory landing landing on a parachute detachment and then we prepared for landing for Nick Hague this was his maiden flights did you discuss it with him I mean not just the technical professional discussion to discuss it from personal point of view I must say that Nick did very well throughout our flight which lasted a little over 19 minutes from liftoff to landing at all stages he was engaged he was supportive he was helping me he was responding to conversations from from Earth from the ground station and after we'll ended and we were recovered by the search and rescue team I didn't see him either frightened so he was he did very well he acted in a professional way and I believe our crew was tightly knit and working well together and I would like very much to take my next flight with Nick well you said 19 minutes slightly more than 19 minutes okay how much time did you spend in that recovery capsule and what did you do during that ballistic reentry exactly all of those 19 minutes and sometime after landing we were inside the landing pod until the search and rescue team who were who parachuted down to get us out they landed next to the pod and they helped us out of the pod they also worked very quickly very professionally after after we landed I called the search and rescue aircraft and then the search and rescue helicopter we established radio communication with them and we were permanently in touch and so we had a good idea who would be doing what you've been trying to ensure six seven G finest I'm a little a little under seven G so what kind of feelings do you have what do you experience can you share it with us so that non trained personnel alignment would understand what what is all about what can you compare it with well you could compare it first of all it can work in various directions the gravity forces can go in various directions the crew who are in their special seats usually you feel the pressure with your chest and your back when there is increased gravity you could compare it with a Canuck of concrete being put on your chest and then with 7g its weight would be seven times your weight so take your weight and multiply it by seven if you weigh 90 kilos you would weigh seven times as much and you would have that weight of concrete were lying on your chest well sounds it's incredibly huge it is actually variable when you train and when you pass medical tests we train on a centrifuge and it has a standard pressure of 8g so crewmembers usually have an idea of what it's going to feel like how you're supposed to breathe in such a situation what you're supposed to do so this wasn't the first time for us and we were ready arty together with Ross cosmas did a TV show called start 40 minutes program sharing exciting stories telling the audience about the launch thank you for taking part in it you responded to some of our questions and there were stupid questions I must admit but there was a question now you're afraid to fly and you said you're not afraid to fly but you are afraid when you do not fly do you still think the same yes my opinion has not changed the way I feel about it after landing nicking myself we feel fine we have passed medical tests not once actually several times and the medics agree that we are fine physically as for our mental states we are ready to continue space flights and so after after there's been a an explanation of what actually happened I'm hoping that we will take a flight in the nearest time who would like that very much talking of psychology this was a heavy change for you and for your family we talked to sweet Lana your spouse who was star city at that moment what do they think about your future flights it's impossible to get prepared for such a off-nominal situation like the one happened the first day well my family members after after they have been through this situation next time it will be more difficult for them to let me go to take such a spaceflight because obviously they've been scared but on the other hand they are confident in our equipment in the way what in our training in what we're prepared for anything can happen this is hardware we're talking about but we are prepared and this is our job we cannot stop at what we've done we need to move on your mother met you at Baikonur when you landed what was the first thing you told her and she told you I hope I told her not to worry I said I was ok I said my health was in good condition I said look at me I'm walking nothing is broken so don't be frightened and after she saw me with her own eyes she calmed down so that's how it was what about your wife with my wife I called her almost immediately after landing we have a we had a satellite phone in our pod specifically for cases like that for situations like that and after we were recovered from the pod we took out the satellite phone I immediately called our superiors I told them that we were alive and well I told them our whereabouts I told them that we had been recovered by the search and rescue team and then I called my wife and told her that I was fine she she learned that there had been an emergency situation but she had no specific information on and I calmed her down and after that I called and then our superiors also started calling our relatives to calm them down staying on what she said first I remember that she said it was a quick one so did the sense of humor help you well I wouldn't say there was any irony in this it was more humor somewhat place with a pity because we realized that our mission had to be aborted when and our space flight not will be going on we had spent 18 months with Nik training for this flight and this would have been his first spaceflight it was second for me and I remembered how you prepare for your first space mission and the feelings that you have some things that you have to feel yourself when you hear about it from someone else it's not enough I'm hoping that we will try it once again and we'll get all those positive emotions that we were supposed to get together from more the statements by Ross cosmas next spring in April we will have next flights where you will fly with possibly a Nick you're an experienced one and you've been training for this flight 487 days so will you spend it on training how will you spend it what will you do during that period I'm hoping that I will spend fewer than a hundred and eighty seven days down here on earth as soon as we start as soon as we're done analyzing the emergency situation the dates for further launches will be identified and as soon as that happens we'll start preparing for our next spaceflight and it'll be clear by that time what kind of training what kind of preparation we'll have to undergo of course we immediately will start training in order to be prepared by the time we need to launch and to be in even better shape going back to the emergency safety system what worked flawlessly and again this was the first incident in more than 30 years so how would you assess the performance of this system and the search and rescue systems - first of all I'd like to thank the designer is the the constructor is the architect of our space crafts all those people involved in the preparations of the space mission and automatics who were involved in the rescue mission the space and the the search and rescue team the medics who saw to us after we had been recovered like you said for 35 years they haven't been such an emergency but this did not play a role because the people involved in the search and rescue the acted very swiftly and professionally and I have nothing but thanks for them and for my part myself personally and other people we have been reaffirmed in our confidence that our Hardware works that we shouldn't be afraid that when need be our hardware will work properly did you get in contact with the ISIS did you talk to Sergey who is up there so we've been talking to him he was waiting for you just for the launch he said that they've been really waiting for you even made a meal for you did you talk to him we did get in touch Sergey called and we had a conversation I told him I was alright that my health was was well he was sorry that we hadn't made it to the ISS because we were carrying presents for the crew of the station but it was also interesting because the guys were taking pictures of our liftoff from the ISS and and they actually managed to capture the moment of the emergency of the abortion of our flight so it was interesting to saw those I hope that the next crew will be going to the ISS as soon as possible and the ISS program the experiments the scientific work and the activities to keep the station operational will continue the Russian space agency said they might push the dates of the next launch earlier to early December thank you so much mr. F Cheney and Neff were sitting down with us and sharing how it all happened thank you so much thank you for having me bye-bye Alexei of Chinon again the Russian cosmonaut who was supposed to go in orbit this Thursday but well because of the rocket failure that didn't happen so he came back to earth in what is called a ballistic ballistic landing it was emergency situation and now what has happened right now he has shared his view he has shared what happened with him from inside that capsule Rory back to you I taught you that eager standoff there with a cosmonaut Alexei ovchinin what a fascinating discussion they're really insightful thank you both into our normal scheduled program here on RT International for you thanks for joining us so far the passengers on a flight from London to Turkey have stood up for a man who was being deported from Britain the man was apparently shouting and crying resisting the deportation when fellow passengers decided to intervene however as our T's poly Boyko explains there is an ugly twist to this story take him off the plane exactly
