WELCOME BACK, WE KNOW DEMOCRATS ARE ENRAGED ABOUT THE 2016 ELECTION IN THE KAVANAUGH AFFIRMATION. CHRIS MATTHEWS SUMS UP THE MOOD. HE NICELY. THE BASE WILL ATTACK THE LEADERSHIP IF THEY ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN, AND THEY SHOULD BECAUSE THIS IS TIME FOR VENGEANCE ON WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS AGO. YES INDEED. NOWHERE DOES IT SAY IT HAS TO BE MADE UP OF NINE JUSTICES, NOT IN ANY AMENDMENT. THAT MAKES THE IDEA POSSIBLE. IT MEANS ADDING EXTRA JUDGES TO THE HIGH COURT TO ADD A NEW IDEOLOGICAL MAJORITY. IT GOES ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER IDEAS TO CHANGE THE RULES OF THE GAME WHEN THERE LOSING AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF RED STATE SENATORS BUT BELIEVE ME, COURT PACKING WILL BE A MAINSTREAM IDEA ON THE LEFT. IN FACT, MICHAEL EVAN ODDI. HE IS OFF AUTHOR OF ITS TIME TO FIGHT DIRTY, HOW THEY CAN BUILD A LASTING IMPACT IN AMERICA. YOU'VE MADE THIS ARGUMENT YOU WANT THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT AS YOU HOPE IT WILL BE IN 2020, YOU WOULD BE ALL RIGHT WITH A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN 2024 OR 2028, BOOSTING UP TO 13, YOU'D BE OKAY WITH THAT, RIGHT. ONE THING I WANT TO SAY, I SAID THIS AND EVERYTHING I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THE SUBJECT, WHAT I REALLY WANT AND WHAT I REALLY PREFER AND HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU IS A COMPROMISE. A COMPROMISE WOULD BE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT ELIMINATES LIFETIME APPOINTMENT ON THE SUPREME COURT. THAT WOULD REDUCE THE ZERO-SUM CHARACTER OF COURT APPOINTMENTS DENOMINATIONS AND IT WOULD ALLOW THE SUPREME COURT TO MORE CLOSELY REFLECT THE OUTCOME OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. SO THAT WE COULD REDUCE THE TEMPTER ON THESE APPOINTMENTS BY GUARANTEEING EVERY PRESIDENT THE RIGHT TO NOMINATE TWO JUSTICES FOR FOUR YEAR TERMS BUT YES, YOU'RE RIGHT, I THINK IF THAT COMPROMISE IS REJECTED I DO ENDORSE EXPANDING THE SUPREME COURT BY AT LEAST TWO SEATS DEPENDING ON HOW MANY IT TAKES. JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU ALSO SUPPORT A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT INCREASING ANOTHER TWO SEATS AFTER IT, YES. I DON'T SEE MUCH OF A FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCE. YES. 0K WITH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT DOING IT. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MIKE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT WITH REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT OR NOT. I ALREADY SAID YES, BUT WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY. IF DEMOCRATS INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE COURT, THEY WILL CONTROL THE COURT FOR TWO YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS OR WHATEVER IT IS. REPUBLICANS WILL RESPOND AND I WILL HAVE CONTROL OF COURT LOOKING BACK. SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF, BUT I THINK YOU'VE JUST MADE THE ARGUMENT PERFECTLY WHY THIS, EVEN I AS A BRITISH PERSON, RELATIVELY NEW UNDERSTANDS THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE SUPREME COURT IS TO BE DIFFERENT TO THE BRANCHES TO THE BRANCH THAT'S PART OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED REFLECT THE POLITICAL MOMENT. IT'S SUPPOSED TO JUDGE THE LAW, NOT MAKE THE LAW. AREN'T YOU ARGUING FOR SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY AT ODDS WITH THE WHOLE BASIS OF THE COURT? NO, I'M NOT. WHAT I WOULD POINT OUT IS, IF YOU HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT GIVES EVERY PRESIDENT THE RIGHT TO APPOINT TWO JUSTICES FOR A FOUR-YEAR TERM, WE WOULD REDUCE THE PARTISAN ANCHOR AROUND THESE APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO RECAPTURE HER COURT IN FOUR OR EIGHT YEARS. I JUST WANT TO GET THE OTHERS ENOUGH. WHAT YOU MAKE OF THIS? IS SILLY. WE COULD ADD ADDITIONAL JUSTICES EVERY FOUR YEARS WHENEVER THERE IS A NEW PRESIDENT ELECTED. LOOK, IT'S A PRACTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND HERE'S WHY. AS YOU POINTED OUT IN YOUR INTRO, FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT TRIED THIS IN 1937 BY ADDING SIX ADDITIONAL JUSTICES. IT REQUIRES, HOWEVER, AS FDR FOUND OUT, A LEGISLATIVE ACT, A BILL PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT. HIS EFFORTS WERE VIEWED AS SO DEVIOUS AND UNDERHANDED, EVEN BY DEMOCRATS THAT HIS BILL DIDN'T EVEN GET OUT OF COMMITTEE. IT'S GOES TO THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED SINCE 1869 WHEN NINE JUSTICES BECAME THE RULE. YOU WERE VERY FIRED UP. IS QUITE DISINGENUOUS. THERE'S A REASON WHY IT'S A LIFETIME APPOINTMENT SO YOU ARE NOT VULNERABLE TO POLITICAL PRESSURE. THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT. THIS IS WHAT YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THIS IS A DELIVER THE BODY. IT SHOULD NOT BE A RESPONSIVE BODY OR REACTIONARY BODY AND YET IT'S A REFLECTION OF HOW THE LEFT USES IT. THEY CAN'T CONVINCE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT THIS ARGUMENT AS WAS ROOSEVELT'S, WAS PART OF THE ACTION TO INTIMIDATE THE SITTING JUDGES NOW, TO SUGGEST THAT IF YOU DO NOT, IT'S LIKE OF BATTERER. IF YOU DO NOT COMPLY WE WILL HURT YOU. I THINK THAT THE UNDERLYING ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. I DO WANT TO BRING DAVID BAGLEY AND ON THAT POINT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A CRUCIAL POINT. IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BODY THAT IS POLITICAL IN THE WAY THAT YOU WANTED TO BE. RIGHT, BUT I THINK THAT WE CAN SEE FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR POLITICS TODAY THAT THE FACT THAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE LIFETIME TENURE MEANS THAT THESE BATTLES TAKE ON THIS REALLY TERRIBLE SIGNIFICANCE IN OUR POLITICS. IT CREATES A ZERO-SUM BATTLE OVER THESE COURT APARTMENTS AND IF YOU JUST AMENDED THE CONSTITUTION OKAY LET ME GET CHARLIE VERY QUICKLY. TIMMY MADE A GRADE TIMMY MADE A GREDE TIMMY MADE A GREAT POINT BUT WHAT IS A JUDGE. IS IT AN ACTIVIST OR INTIMIDATION OF THE LAW. WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT ARBITER AND INTERPRETERS. THEY BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE AN ACTIVIST TO ADVANCE THEIR AGENDA. HE'S UPSET BECAUSE WE HAVE FIVE JUSTICES THAT WILL LOOK AT WHAT THE TEXT SAYS, NOT WHAT THEY HOPE IT SAYS. THIS IS A WAR ON THE CONSTITUTION AND THE RULE OF LAW AND HE'S NOT UPSET THAT WE CAN'T GET MEDICAID FOR ALL. ALSO THE BOOK IS CALLED IT'S TIME TO FIGHT DIRTY SO YOU SORT OF SEE WHAT HE'S THINKING. ALSO ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES. YOU KNOW HOW MAY PEOPLE HILLARY CLINTON HAS CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT #ZERO BECAUSE SHE LOST. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS HAD TO BECAUSE HE WON. THAT IS HOW IT WORKS. THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRATS DO AS YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER. WHEN THEY LOSE THEY TRY TO CHANGE THE GAME. ONE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON WE HAD TO GET RID OF THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND ALSO CALLING FOR DEFECTORS TO DEFECT, BUT WHAT'S HILARIOUS IS THAT MORE PEOPLE WENT AGAINST HILLARY CLINTON WITHOUT THEM PRESIDENT TRUMP SO BACKFIRED. ONE CORRECTION, HE CONTINUES TO SAY THAT THE DIVISION IN THIS DYNAMIC, THERE IS NO DIVISION. IT'S ONLY THE DEMOCRATS WHO GET UPSET. WE'VE NEVER DONE THAT. IS ONE OTHER THING, I JUST WANT TO SAY THANKS FOR COMING ON AND DEBATING IT, BUT THE LEFT'S REACTION TO LEADERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THERE'S
