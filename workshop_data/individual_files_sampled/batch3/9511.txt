AND THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND A 1973 MEMORANDUM AND UNDER THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION THAT YOU MUST NOT AND CANNOT INDICT THE SITTING PRESIDENT. IT IS A MATTER OF CONSTITUTIONAL INTERPRETATION AND 44 YEARS THAT IS THE POSITION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND WE HAD LAW PROFESSORS AND ALL OVER THE TV AND RADIO TALKING ABOUT THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE AND MEDIA TYPES TALKING ABOUT IT. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER, THE OFFICIALSTITION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WE DON'T CHARGE A SITTING PRESIDENT WITH A CRIME. Sean: MARK LEVIN, THE GREAT ONE ON OUR PROGRAM AND HE WORKED AD EDNIECE CHIEF OF STAFF AND HE WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL AND EXPLAINING DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICY. MARK BROKE IT RIGHT HERE. JOINS US NOW AND HOST OF LCH LIBERTY AND LEVIN. AND HOW ARE YOU, MY FRIEND? I AM GETTING TICKED OFF BECAUSE YOU ARE RIGHT. BIG NEWS, THEY CAN'T INDICT A SITTING PRESIDENT. NO KIDDING. YOU HAVE SAID IT OVER A YEAR. WE POINTED IT OUT REPEATEDLY. THE MEDIA GOT THE ASPECTS OF THIS WRONG AND IGNORED THE REAL WRONG AND A PUCE OF POWER AND BEEN ON A WITCH HUNT GOING ON OVER A YEAR. AND TO ME. THIS HAS TO COME TO AN END AND SOME TRUTH NEEDS TO COME OUT. SIR? THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION HAS REVEAL WOULD THE GREATEST PEPITATOR AGAINST THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WAS THE GOVERNMENT AND WAS THE FBI, CIA, AND NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DIRECTOR. Sean: TOP RANK AND FILE. I WANT TO TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WILL NOT BE INDICTED AND IF HE IS, HE WILL TAKE IT TO THE SUPREME COURT AND WIN. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN. WE SAW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USED BY THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AND HEAD OF THE CIA AND FBI AND NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND MANY, MANY OTHERS USED TO DESTROY THE CANDIDACY OF AN OPPOSITION CANDIDATE OF THE OTHER PARTY, DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THOO THAT IS, THE PRESIDENT'S EXISTING ADMINISTRATION AND INTERFERING IN THE ELECTIONS AND WE NEVER SAW THIS BEFORE IN AMERICAN HISTORY. WE KNOW THAT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SPIED, LOOK, IT IS IT THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND HE'S THE PRESIDENT AND THE BUCK STOPS AT HIS DESK AND HE MAY BE PLAYING AROUND HIS LIBRARY IN CHICAGO AND HE IS BE HELD RESPONSIBLE. THE FISA COURT FAILED US. WE HAVE NATIONAL SECURITY LETTERS THAT ARE USED IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES BEING USED AND A FBI AGENTS THAT TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO INVESTIGATE A CANDIDATE AND HIS CAMPAIGN AND ACTUAL SPIES IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. WHAT IS IT? THE SOVIET UNION OR VENEZUELA OR CENTRAL AMERICA? IT IS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ONCE MR. MUELLER TURNS OVER THE REPORT TO MR. ROSENSTEIN. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD PICK FAVORITE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY. NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE PALS. BUT GIVE HIM AN ASSIGNMENT. I DON'T CARE WHAT JEFF SESSIONS. AND TELL HIM. I WANT YOU TO INVESTIGATE THE ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS ELECTION AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY. AND THE INNERFERRANCE BY THE FBI AND CIA AND NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. AND BRENNAN AND CLAPPER AND COMEY DID. NOT BECAUSE I AM GOING TO PUNISH THEM. YOU AM MAKE DETERMINATION. Sean: SUSAN RICE. I WOULD ALSO TELL THEM TO FIX THIS. WE CAN'T HAVE AN ELECTION WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INTERFERING WITH AN ELECTION AND I THINK THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO DO TO APPOINT A COMMISSION OF 5 OR 7 PEOPLE AND TOP NOTCH MEN FROM PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AND WOMEN AND SAY FIX THE FBI AT THE TOP AND FIX THE CIA AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND WE CAN'T ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN TO ANOTHER PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES. TO HELL, SORRY JEFF, JEFF SESSIONS AND ALL OF THE OTHER PEOPLE. THE PRESIDENT SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. Sean: DON'T APOLOGIZE. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SPIES IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND FAIL WOULD FISA COURT. THIS IS INCREDIBLE STUFF. Sean: YOU TALK ABOUT THE SPIES. IT WAS NOT JUST ONE FISA COURT JUDGE GIVEN PHONY INFORMATION THAT WAS NEVER VERIFIED OR VERIFIED AND NEVER TOLD THAT HILLARY CLINTON PAID FOR THE INFORMATION. WHERE IS CONGRESS? WHY WON'T CONGRESS BRING THESE FISA JUDGES AND DEMAND WHAT THEY FEEL. UNLIKE THE DEMOCRATS, THE REPUBLICANS SCATTERED LIKE RATS. YOU HAVE CERTAIN REPUBLICANS WHO ARE IN WITH THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DESTROY THE PRESIDENT. THEY CANNOT GET OVER THE FACT HE WAS ELECTED. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING HERE SO GUESTS CAN REPEAT IT. WE NEED AN ACCOUNTING OF WHAT MR. BRENNAN DOES AND CLAPPER DID AND BOOK SALES MAN COMEY DID AND SUSAN RICE AND SAMANTHA POWERS DID. WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE UNMASKING STUFF NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET EVEN. WE NEED TO FIX THESE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. Sean: IT IS NOT A JOKE. IF WE DON'T FIX IT, WE LOSE OUR COUNTRY.
