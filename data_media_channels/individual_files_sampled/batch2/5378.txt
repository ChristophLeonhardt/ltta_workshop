my colleague Tom winter here to explain there's always a difference here when you hear the words wiretap and surveillance and the the deep the the level of detail of the surveillance sometimes it's monitoring when a phone call comes in sometimes it's overhearing explain what we reported and what we now know so Chuck based on information from two independent sources who have a long term track record of credibility and providing accurate information of this news organization they today earlier today based on that information we reported that there was a wiretap on Michael Cohen's phone meaning that they were able to listen into conversations from phone lines associated with Michael Cohen to any other person that he might have talked to and in part of that reporting we said one of those phone calls was between a phone line associated with Michael Cohen and the White House now three senior US officials are telling us that this is a it was not a wiretap instead it was what is referred to as a pen register in plain English that means it's a log of phone calls that were made from specific phone line from a specific phone line or specific phone lines in this case we know Michael Cohen had several phone lines and so in this case they were able to see who he called or who's somebody using his phone lines called but they were not able to listen in real time or record those conversations so it's an important distinction Chuck I want to I want to add to that by saying that it doesn't change necessarily the legal bar here in order to get a warrant of this type it's still a very serious matter because they would have needed to fill out a significant affidavit and be able to go down a significant Road to get this approved by a federal judge essentially to bring back a phrase that we used to use a lot during during the Snowden revelations and frankly during the investigation in the Boston Marathon this is metadata exactly is the meaning he's being surveilled but in a look they're trying to figure out who he's talking to not necessarily what he's talking about right so this would be is if I was going to call you earlier today to get caught up they would seek Tom winters phone call they would see my number and see that I dialed Chuck Todd they would not know what you and I said to each other we could have talked about everything into anything into your point with with respect to metadata that's exactly what this is it's a phone number it's a time and based upon what we've been told by three US officials that earlier the reporting was too far that there was some sort of a wiretap here where there was real time monitoring in this case they were just able to see that somebody called somebody else do we know the extent right now because there's been some filings and you and I were talking about this there yes government is admitted to some surveillance that they've been doing for months over Cohen but we don't know the extent do we know the extent of how much they've been surveilling Cohen how thoroughly is it been emails texts phone calls like what do we know so so Chuck it's a great question so we know from public filings that they were able to do surveillance on his emails the federal prosecutors put that in open court anybody that with access or wants to get the record can get it themselves and for that they had a filter team because obviously there could be attorney-client communications within that and so they had a separate team look at it and then hand over the relevant materials to the investigators that are working on the case so so we know for a fact it's emails were being told now that this is a this is some sort of a pen register that was being used so we know that you know what calls he may have been making or people using his phone lines we're making now as part of this could there be other types of things that were monitored real-time as it relates to communications obviously everybody now uses text they use various types of apps to communicate that's something that we haven't yet seen come out and that's something that we haven't been guided to or told explicitly at this point all right Tom Weiner come on here important correction to our earlier report that we know has has gotten some big headlines Michael Cohen's calls are being monitored but they're not being listened into at least as
