hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle at the moment it is anyone's guess where the Korean negotiations stand again Donald Trump is the wild card also it's the u.s. isolating itself on the world stage crosstalking the Korean Peninsula I'm joined by my guest mark sloboda he's an international affairs and security analyst we also have Dimitri Babak she's the political analyst with Sputnik International and we cross to Alex Christopher oh he is the director in writer for the duran dot-com alright gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means you can jump in any time you want and I always appreciate Alex let me go to you first then Cyprus here I sent out to all you guys an article written by Ray McGovern what's regarding what's going on with the on-and-off-again the negotiations about this upcoming summit in Singapore what's really happening here because it looks like it's we really have a lovefest I don't think that's an exaggeration with the Koreans right now we had a second summit secretly coming together then released to the press Trump goes out then now he says maybe he's back in what's going on is it the john bolton effect is a Mike Pompeo is there a tug of war do you think inside the White House because the Koreans seem to have a lot of commonality at this moment yeah absolutely I think that it all comes back to Mike Pence and John Bolton bringing up the Libya card why they had to bring up Libya as anyone's guess but obviously we know what happened in Libya where they they got rid of all there are their weapons and then 10 years later approximately 10 years later the the US and NATO dismantled the entire Libyan state and and now the the country is in shambles and so you know when you when you look at North Korea's response to what pence said it was actually pretty measured Kim didn't respond at all North Korea responded I believe they responded properly because Libya is a sensitive topic especially with North Korea and the fact they're going to give up their their weapons and any right to defense that they have so I think what you had here is is a very poorly timed statement by pence and of course Bolton and I think you're seeing both in the both in effect for sure here in the Trump foreign policy team you know mark when you bring up the Libya model there's actually two of them and I think this is one of the problems that the administration is having one was an agreement to take apart their nuclear program and a general rapprochement with with the West and then you have the 2011 bombing and destruction I don't think you can separate them well because most certainly they're not separated in the minds of the North Korean of anyone I don't think because there first of all Libya did not have nuclear weapons North Korea is a nuclear-armed state these are vastly different scenarios and North Korea demands to be treated as they are that's how I got to the table IDIA had a nossa nuclear program that really hadn't make any advances they didn't have the resources or the the scientific expertise to really pursue it they gave up everything initially in just returned from goodwill from the West and several years later the result of that is their government was bombed out of power and overthrown and and Qadhafi was brutally killed in fact Ian Bremmer the head of the Eurasia Group put out a he has an org called g0 labs that makes little cute puppet shows that reinforced his political messages and the latest one quite tasteless and and really disturbing had kim iljoong kim jong onto having nightmares of waking up like Qadhafi being a brutalized raped and then murdered by jihadist rebels and that of course is the message that was sent to North Korea the reason John Bolton said this was because he intended to sabotage the Taksim Frank it was in it it was easy we identified it early on that he was one of the biggest obstacles to these talks in any progress being made and he sabotage and then drama that you have you have Pompeii land is actually Secretary of State right now he was there before he was even confirmed to start moving negotiations head so he's butting heads with it seem with John Bolton well it's true and it's just amazing how Trump says I had to cancel this meeting because of your hostile statement that is his letter to kim jeong-hoon well I mean if anyone made hostile statements it was Mike Pence who compared both Korea to Libya and if anyone should have nightmares this should be Nicolas Sarkozy you know the former French president who is now accused by the French Justice of taking money from Qaddafi using them for his campaign then starting bombing Libya before all the other NATO members then seizing the assets of the Libyan government from their bank accounts so if anyone should have nightmares and pricks of conscience that should be Sarkozy my dad it happened so let me go back to Alex in Cyprus here what I think is really interesting what's going on here Western media is so western-centric and they're all looking at what's that what's going on in the White House what we just talked about right here but really the real game in town is the South Korean president moon it looks like he came in and really did snatched victory from the jaws of defeat here and I find it really remarkable how a droid he is and his diplomacy he's eating right he will be caught quick in every single way he did that's a pretty good point go ahead Alex yep moon is showing that he's very serious about a peace deal that goes without question and really he backed Trump into a corner and there's a lot of ego in and around Trump that I think Pompey will play too in that array McGovern mentioned in his article I mean this is this is Trump's chance his big chance to get a Nobel Peace Prize and so you have bolted on the one hand trying to sabotage the entire peace process which he's done before in the past and I think you're gonna be looking at Pompeo maybe some other people in the Trump White House trying to play to Trump's ego and moon I believe played his card perfectly by meeting with kids showing that he's serious about a peace deal kid showing that he's serious about in negotiation a peace deal and now the balls in Trump's courts and I and I would also say one other player going to mark here the Chinese have shown themselves to be quite serious about what's going on here as well I mean there's this perception is that Kim went to Beijing for permission basically no he wanted to inform his Chinese into lockers what he was going to do and they agreed to it because it is a solid approach here the problem is is that trumps enemies in the US and in the world don't want to see him succeed that's the ambivalence that they show in reporting all this particularly in the media but all the other players seem to be quite serious on how to move forward yeah he made his second trip to China in the last year and I'm sure that the these peace talks were the biggest and again we said this weeks ago already North Korea and South Korea whatever happens with the US and the mixed signals that is sending it is it it's clear that they don't have a clear policy at this point I don't I don't think this is any type of strategic ambiguity they literally don't know what they're doing and North Korea and South Korea need to sit down with each other and continue the process no matter that they need to actually ignore the US and then again maybe try to buy it in at a later date but I I think it's important again this this Libya scenario to mention that you know Bolton's statements while provocative were largely ignored by North Korea North Korea was more upset when the u.s. and South Korea I against agreements that had already been made conducted strategic that is nuclear drills on the North Korean border involved they announced it was going to be conducted with b-52s and f-22s which are both nuclear capable North Korea really objected to this quite strenuously and then it was dialed back and the b-52s were dialed out but the interesting thing is here's a maximum of pressure being applied here you know budino I mean it's illogical I mean this is a very sensitive time right now I mean we Mark really made a good point here I mean president moon went across the DMZ I mean think of that for the last you know since 1953 what that means is crossing the Berlin Wall exactly the Koreans did what they could you know we can't accuse both North Korea South Korea of not doing anything for peace but coming back to that article by Ray McGovern you know I have a peace plan for Korea let me just remind our listeners that reg McGovern is is a hero you know he's a former CIA official who is now dissident who recently got beaten you know because he wanted to ask an uncomfortable question but my peace plan you know based on that rain McGowan's article where he says that Trump should be late you know dream of his Nobel Peace Prize okay since the Nobel Peace price is already discredited by being given to a bomb let that Nobel Peace Prize Committee in Oslo let them come to Donald Trump and say congratulations and all that rot man get your prize would be the only way to save the Nobel Peace Prize after Obama Gorbachev Arafat and others go ahead right okay let me go back to ounce before we go to the break here I think which I don't want to go into it in great depth but I mean you know we had my Mike Pompeo come out with his twelve points for in dealing with Iran here I mean we can pair that which was all quite ludicrous and very much about ridiculed by in foreign people in the foreign policy blob it seems to me that does mirror the North Korean strategy meaning they're really they really haven't thought it out very well go ahead Alex yeah yeah we had Pompeii owes twelve steps to Wars really what it was twelve steps to regime change but I mean I think you're right Peter we can't over stress the fact that it's not only the Libya model that North Korea is nervous about its the Iran model that Libya made that North Korea is nervous about let's not forget it's only been a couple of weeks since the United States broke their agreement with Iran so there's no doubt that that Kim and moon are looking at what happened in Iran mark yeah North Korea has already made two significant gestures of real significance they have detonated their tunnels that they use for a nuclear detonation and they unilaterally returned three u.s. spies so they've obviously done their part but even Bolton is sabotaging that's not only referring to the threat of Libyan regime change but by demanding that North Korea completely denuclearized right from the get-go without anything in force before the meeting in Singapore before there's a peace treaty signed before there's any type of phase steps and and this is a way of raising expectations Bolton actually said that he wanted the talks to go forward as soon as possible so that nothing could be done - then skip steps later and jump right to more serious measures we all we all know what that means well essentially what Bolton is saying first surrender and then we can sit down and talk okay and this is exactly the same message gentlemen that the US the Trump administration is sending to Iran we're going to go to a short break gentlemen after that after that short break we'll continue our discussion on some real news stay with RT welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter belt remind you we're discussing some real news okay gentlemen let's switch gears Dima I just came back from the st. Petersburg International Economic Forum obviously in st. Petersburg one of the things I find really quite remarkable not the fact that I'm a chrome was there because he'd just been in the United States and you know we've got a lot of hugs and you know that his dandruff taken off his shoulder but he didn't get anything in st. Petersburg they looked very very different the there was an open embrace and we had the giant the Japanese Prime Minister there we had angle and Merkel that has visited Putin twice in Sochi gone to China there seems like a lot of movement on the on the table right now go ahead well in general if isolation is about 15,000 international business figures coming to st. Petersburg that's a very nice isolation I wish many countries in Europe this kind of isolation but indeed I think it was a success you know gauging mr. macron and and Shinzo Abe they come to st. Petersburg however in general I don't think McCrone rate has the power to hit like two he'd like to hope their confrontation with Russia unfortunately the you know the articles about getting rid of so-called energy dependence on Russia a lot of other discriminatory closes about relations with Russia they're written in their in their laws in the norms of the European Union mister macron simply doesn't have the power to change them and I think this is something that a lot of people don't understand but you know we go to Alex in Cyprus here I deem is absolutely right a lot of this is really kind of written into stone here but I think there is we're in a moment right now where people are beginning to look at option something we haven't seen on this scale in my lifetime at least okay I mean I you do have the Europeans actually considering different ways of moving forward because of the growing mistrust with trumps White House go ahead Alex in Cyprus yes we're seeing the world under President Trump and just as President Trump is exercising his part of the deal foreign policy practice it works both ways and we're seeing the Europeans we're seeing Merkel we're seeing macaron we're seeing Russia and China also weigh their options and look at their negotiating leverage when dealing with the United States as well as when dealing with each other so I think we're seeing a lot of jockeying for different positions we're seeing the national interests of countries come back to the forefront and this is really all because of Trump's instability his unpredictability but also his his style of bringing you know everything about foreign policy to to a transactional level it's all about negotiations and so it works both ways in the Europeans I think are now starting to realize that they can exercise their their options mark yeah well I see your dismisses look as usual I mean I think we have to take all of this with with not just a grain of salt but a good dash of salt over the shoulder because Makran seems to have this type of simpering egoistic personality where he has to kiss the rear end of whoever he's in the room with and and played to whether that's Trump or or Putin and we saw it I mean to add insult to injury and his recent trip to the White House evidently the tree that he planted that he and his wife planted with his teacher his wife whenever the story is there planted in in the White House grounds was then dug up after he left so I certainly I mean is that breaking the mrt no that's not breaking it was widely reported the head of the IMF the French president the the Japanese Prime Minister and the Chinese president if that center that's isolation vice president vice president yeah the second-in-command in China that that is international isolation but these steps by Merkel visiting Sochi again and then visiting China for a second time macron coming to Russia talks of reconciliation macron admitting the the obvious mistakes were made when talking about reconciliation with Russia which it very clear who made the mistakes of that yeah exactly this is we shouldn't we should be happy for this but we shouldn't take it for more than it is this is normal realist balancing this is what states do when states other states do things that angry with them they remind send the message that they have other options to explore and that's absolutely right but what is not right or a kind of out of balance is it and we've mentioned this on this program before Trump doesn't care he doesn't care about the implications and and we've said here he's playing to his base I'm sure he's got a you know a checklist in his pocket you know he's checking them through I mean is unpopular and his why are the moving the embassy to Jerusalem going out of the Iran deal being very fickle dweud comes to North Korea I mean these are these these are things he ran on well I think we should always remember that we are not being opposed by states were opposed by an ideology and the problem with Trump is that he's aggressive stupid dangerous but he does not fully understand this ideology he was not certified by them she warned unexpectedly and they can't forgive it to him even though he did all the things that they wanted he bombed Syria he was very like threatening to North Korea he did everything they usually do continuing threatening of Venezuela Russia Russia Russia should be sanctioned sanctions action because that's what his war policy seems though be absolutely and the funny thing is that the Democrats and the European liberals accused him of being in cahoots with Russia they continued to accuse him even though he has done more anti-russian things than any president in history of the United States before him I mean to me this is all just embodied in that terrible lawsuit that the Democrats are making and they won't run to support them you just let me remind our listeners don't put too much into the lawsuit there I think this is a joke you Russian Federation Russian intelligence Trump's campaign Julian Assange Jared Kushner to me it's like imitation is cross you know Janet Kushner and Julian Assange it's like you and mother threes and stormy Daniels in one lawsuit you know Romans name were stone to me Daniel's free zone here Alec let me go to you in Cyprus but what are the interesting thing and I'm agreeing with Dima is that it's it's an anglo-saxon cabal here that is the anti-russian I mean obviously elites in Europe we're gonna play along with it because that's the the the cue that they're given from the from Berlin I'm sorry from Washington but it seems to be very anglo-saxon when continuing this anti Russia rhetoric and policies they see the Europeans that is something we have European leaders coming here to Moscow and to negotiates negotiate is the beginning that's the beginning of a process let's go ahead Alex yeah we're right in the beginning I believe that McCrone even stated quite quite sufficiently that you know the Russia is an integral part of Europe I mean he was he was very clear in his statements that that he does not want Russia to drift further east but you know let's let's not forget that Trump is not a statesman or a diplomat he's a business guy so I don't think he really understands any of this stuff that's going on I think he's brought everything to a business level and let's face it being a real estate tycoon in New York is probably a very dirty business and you make agreements and you break agreements and you twist arms you can do a lot of stuff that you don't maybe seen below the belt in foreign diplomacy and Trump is bringing a lot of that to the world stage and you even had Russian President Putin say that it seems to be right now that's you know the new rules are all about breaking the rules and that's very much an allusion to how Trump is dealing with a lot of the the foreign policy issues to date it's a very good point I mean you know it's breaking all the rules but you know if you're always breaking the rules you can't make a new rule and that is the big problem here right mark III I think Trump's art of the deal is like a Mafia don when when John Bolton brought up you know the the Libya option for North Korea Trump replied well that's not what we're planning the Libyan option we totally decimated them that was a decimation he said and in case you don't know what that means that was with the omen Roman legionary practice of killing one out of every ten people and North Korea has already been through worse than that with it through the u.s. hellacious bombing campaign of North Korea during the North Korean war so that it couldn't have been well-received there but and then he said that is that's only if we if you break that if you don't sign a deal that that's the only time decimation so either side on the bottom line or get decimated that is a Mafia don threat so I'm Dennis Lee that this whole st. Petersburg an international economic forum was overshadowed by Trump's TRAI war on global trade and not not just globalization but trade with allies Trump has put effectively sanctions on on South Korea he's put tariffs rounds of tariffs on China sanctions on Russia Syria North Korea Iran he's promising the biggest sanctions and world history Begley Trump Trump remember where these little fingers loves everything Bank right you're bigger than it is he likes to exaggerate the size of everything but he's also threatening sanctions in two ways over both Iran and the completion of Nord Stream against his own allies in the EU right which is shorter to you know really royal them and you're really interesting is I'm glad you brought up the energy security here in Kadima because you know there's a lot of things that the Europeans will go along with with the with the Americans traditionally and not not specifically with Trump now but their energy security is something that is very real and very much theirs and I see the in and the Germans are leading that a push back that they will have North stream we also have the pipeline that will be coming through turkey so I mean it looks like they're there yeah well and that's a if he won because turkey is always a wild card but I mean this is an issue that is very real and very important to them and Russia is a reliable partner we've seen that but there are two different things the European Union and Europe Europe needs Russian gas the European Union needs to damage Russia basically why did they destroy the project of South Stream the South Stream was a savior for Europe you know it was going to bring cheap energy to the two most problematic States to eat and to grease but they EU did everything to foil the project to be fair the Germans ruined South Stream so that they could get Nordstrom the energy run out of time here many thanks to my guests here in Moscow and in Cyprus this is the end of our broadcast segment stay with us for the extended version on our YouTube channel see you next time and remember across knuckles now for the extended version of our program we have political potpourri deema Europe well I think the most dangerous event that can happen in the next week maybe next few weeks is the eviction of Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London the Ecuadorian government has already lifted additional security measures what is interesting is that the Guardian investigated this how come the Ecuadorian government spent five million dollars on additional security managed measures to keep mr. Russia our son safe they better investigate the UK government how much they spent for for keeping the vigil you know around the Ecuadorian embassy in order to get this this one man you know who created this internationally recognized a network of Investigation you know who all did you know what Woodward and I mean I'm not I'm not a big personal fan of Julian Assange okay but WikiLeaks it's an over it's over 10-year history is gotten it right it's never been a reported fake news I've never seen it having an overt political agenda right politically well I mean well they don't like power ok don't like us hegemony ok welcome and specifically my point my point is here is that where are the liberal standing up for freedom of speech where are they you know they've abandoned that principle here ok and I think that's a real disgrace of for Western media is well abandoning those principles well the the Liberals support those human rights activists who protect the Liberals who actually agree with them anyone disagreed with the Liberals immediately gets blacklisted and you can do against him/her whatever of RIA Novosti Ukraine a Ukrainian citizen Kirill wyszynski was arrested and the offices of RIA Novosti in Ukraine were raided by the the Ukrainian Gestapo I mean the SBU the security services and he is being charged with high Creason a journal which is evidently speaking against the regime that seized power in Ukraine in 2014 as a journalist complicating the Western media is completely silent about this you won't find this reported anywhere at least the International Committee journal an International Committee protect journalists and reporters without borders OSE have made motions of condemning it by Western journalists do not discuss it I can give you even a better example Andrei Babbitt Sookie I think anyone listing sifting through the American media ten years or 15 years ago can easily find that name he was the hero number one for the United States and for the you when he reported on the war in Chechnya now he's living in Donbass and he is reporting every day or on the crimes which the Ukrainian regime committed there and no one is interested it is the same person whom you gave prices whom you like made into the best journalists in Europe almost and now now that he became an opponent they're no longer well when you're in a solo your speech is worthless for these people Alex go ahead and do you want to continue with this or I know you've got a lot on your plate there go ahead a little bit on the Assad I think the news is definitely tightening around Assange I mean we haven't heard from him he's he's had pretty much his his communication with the outside world cut off and I also think you have someone like Mike Pompeo who's not Secretary of State who's always been chasing after Assange and so I think he's exerting a lot of pressure as well to to finally get his man so we can't forget that you know you had Pompey was with the CIA now he's Secretary of State he's been after Assad for a while so I think he is Assange is in a very precarious position right now I wouldn't be surprised if Ecuador does give him up okay Marc what what happened to him tell our viewers if they give him up oh well if they give him up and we've already gotten plenty of evidence we've had US officials say when Julian Assange offered to testify about what really happened about the whistleblower that gave him the information and you know about the two basically to dismiss this whole Russia election hacking nonsense the US official replied that the only way that we'll see him is in custody basically admitting what we all assume that there is a secret us in Dickman and the UK will grab him and turn him right over to the Americans for again high treason American citizen that although we know that the u.s. likes to extend their laws and apply them throughout the world so I I don't think that will stop any any type of witch burning of Julian Assange but as much as I do respect Julian Assange boasts for his his political stance and for the important work Wikipedia has done I think this would actually be a great thing if Julian Assange was made a martyr to US domination of the world and I my forgiveness to all the fans to Julian and everyone else but this would expose the u.s. for what it really is what do you know what they did to private Manning okay okay Alex popery what's on your mind well I think there's a lot going on right now in the Balkans and in in much of the region you're seeing the Turkish lira plummet and I think that's not by coincidence I think you're seeing the u.s. deep state reaction to a lot of what air Dewan has been doing and they're attacking the the lira and the Turkish economy and I think you also are looking at right now a very heated exchange between Greece and Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with the name negotiation you know the former Republic of Macedonia is now looking to enter negotiations with EU they want to get into NATO and they're trying to solve this name dispute all of Greece right now is praying to God that a prime minister cheap on us does not include the name Macedonia in this new name that they're trying to negotiate so I think you're seeing a very volatile region you're seeing a lot of attacks on the Turkish economy and on the Turkish lira okay and you're also seeing a lot of activity to try and break the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into NATO into the EU with destabilizing that CPI US government and and whatever stability is left in Greece Alex and then the presumed destabilization of the Turkish currency what is the political goal here is it to take naka air21 down a few notches here I mean it's kind of like throwing the baby out with the bathwater I mean you punish the entire country because you don't like everyone's policies go ahead Alex we've been talking a lot about Trump's you know they're very freehand and dishing out sanctions you know everywhere and so I just see I just see this is you've already tried it cool and you've tried to remove air dewild with force with military force and that failed spectacularly so now they're playing the economic card I mean obviously they can only go so far because turkey is a member of NATO they're strategically extremely important to the United States so I think they're just trying to send a message to our go on and say look don't take this too far don't reposition Turkey too far or else we are going to pretty much destroy your economy and I think that's the message assess what a way to treat an ally amazing here Mark Jackson I will agree to disagree on what with US involvement and serious turkey a turkey has invaded northern Latakia I behind mil a Turkish military convoys have entered another incursion point in northern sia Syria the Latakia is the Alawite stronghold the the northern hilly region though does have a Turkmen minority so basically a small horde of jihadis propped by the Turks have entered with Turkish military convoys covering them and crossing the border into Syria to support them and right now the Syrian government is busy using artillery to to bomb them quite heavily and hopefully it's this is a repeated game of whack-a-mole against jihadis in northern Latakia the real difference this time is Oregon perhaps attempting to distract from his domestic disabilities has sent the actual Turkish military openly with Turkish military vehicles in the northern Latakia in the South the Syrian army is getting ready to move against it is a combined there is Isis al Qaeda and allied previously Western supported groups in Daraa the south of Syria on the Jordan and Golan Heights border such as it is the Golan Heights a series of course but I mean the US has threatened Syria not to liberate these areas and that is the important culmination point through Jordan of the m5 highway this means that the u.s. threatening Syria not to liberate their own country there is literally protecting some of the last pockets of Isis and of course al Qaeda in South said of course you'll never hear everything you know I'd like to point out to our viewers here you'll never hear this on in western television the facts on the ground what's happening it's also the problem that Israel is openly supporting the Grice down there just maybe to summarize it I think it's the West's worst nightmare that Russia Turkey and Iran actually resolve the problem never be said that way never think essentially what they want and this is why you we're gonna say there is to keep the status quo as it is right now keep the country in disarray right present conflict and partition the West will do anything to prevent this from pain they will topple the Turkish lira they will encourage Israel to bomb the Iranian I mean their alien forces in Syria they will do anything what they don't want is actually a successful peace in that country unfortunately the truth alright gentlemen we've run out of time I hope our viewers have enjoyed the extended version of our program see you next weekend remember crosstalk rules you
