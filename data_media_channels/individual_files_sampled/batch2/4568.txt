today's the last day of February which usually is the shortest month of the year however this February of 2018 it lasted more than 20 years at least it feels that way in terms of news years it's all been one month a month ago today and the last day of January the New York Times broke a very unusual story about a guy who had a somewhat unique role in the Trump administration his name was Mark Coelho for a while his job was that he was the spokesman for the legal team that's representing the president in the Russia scandal now Russia scandal is big enough and sprawling enough and serious enough that not only are we at the point where lawyers need their own lawyers but lawyers need spokespersons for this scandal and that's what mark our ally was doing for a while before he quit that job under unusual circumstances last summer in July the first substantive thing we learned about the circumstances are for he quit actually came months later came from Michael Wolf's controversial book fire and fury page 260 to be precise here's how Michael Wolfe explained mark Corallo quitting his job as the spokesman for Trump's Russia lawyers this comes at the end of a long discussion along chapter about the New York Times breaking the news about that Trump Tower meeting during the campaign where all those Russians turned up to provide dirt on Hillary Clinton so Michael Wolfe in this chapter goes into great detail about president Trump's effort with his top staffers to try to maneuver a way out of that story without getting hurt to try to spin that story basically to try to construct a false narrative about that Trump Tower meeting that wouldn't make it look so bad for them and at the end of that whole discussion we get on page 262 mark Corallo quitting quote marker ello was instructed not to speak to the press indeed not to even answer his phone seeing no good outcome and privately confiding that he believed the meeting on Air Force One represented a likely obstruction of justice marker ello quit and that was the full discussion of it from fire and fury intriguing right mark karela quit because he believed he'd witnessed a likely obstruction of justice on Air Force One mm-hmm we got that from the book and then a month ago on the last day of genuine the New York Times finally got that full story and they spelled it out that trumped our meeting involving Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner and Donald jr. and all those Russians the Trump Tower meeting happened June of 2016 during the presidential campaign and of course nobody from the campaign it admitted that meeting happened for like a year right the Trump campaign and the Trump transition and then the Trump administration all were insisting there had been no meetings with Russians by anybody on the campaign nobody who'd been actually in that meeting with those Russians during the campaign ever admitted to it all that time until last summer July of 2017 when the New York Times broke that story that the the Trump Tower meeting had happened and they sort of broke that story in pieces their first headline about the Trump Tower meeting was just about the fact that it had happened and who they knew had attended that meeting they didn't know at first how the meeting had been set up what the premise was for calling that meeting in the first place how all those people ended up in the same room together at Trump Tower but in reporting out those stories reporters from The Times contacted the Trump White House and they contacted lawyers for people who they knew had been in that meeting and they asked what was discussed at that meeting and also what did the people who went to that meeting what did they think was going to be discussed there The Times reporters submitted a list of 14 questions about the meeting to the White House and to the lawyers of the Trump campaign aides who attended that meeting that list of questions was reportedly received mid-flight on Air Force One as the president and his top staff will flying home from a trip to Europe quote president Trump's aides received the list mid-flight on Air Force One on the way back from the summit meeting and began writing a response in the planes front cabin president Trump huddled with hope Hicks during the meeting according to people familiar with the episode hope Hicks was sending frequent texts to Donald Trump jr. who was in New York Allen Garten a lawyer for Donald Trump jr. who was also in New York was also messaging with White House advisors aboard the plane the President himself supervised the writing of the statement according to three people familiar with the episode a fierce debate erupted over how much information the news release should include president Trump was insistent about including language that the meeting was about Russian adoptions ultimately that statement was cobbled together a board Air Force One the one who said them that said the meeting was an innocuous discussion of Russian adoptions that statement was ultimately sent out to the New York Times and that statement of course was total bull Puckey it was issued in the name of Donald Trump jr. that was the statement that said it was a short introductory meeting I asked Jared and Paul to stop by we primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children a program that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government but it wasn't a campaign issue and there was no follow-up that statement was not true that was not a true statement about what happened at that meeting or how it came about but the President himself reportedly supervised the creation of that statement and that is what was sent out to the New York Times to try to make this story go away and now here's the important part the next morning there was reportedly a conference call which this is what was first reported by the New York Times a month ago today on that conference called the morning after that statement went out on that call our mark Corallo spokesman for the president's legal team and hope Hicks and the president back to the Times reporting quote what transpired on the call is a matter of dispute in mr. Kerala's account which he provided contemporaneously to three colleagues who later gave it to the times smart man mark karela told President Trump and hope Hicks that the statement they drafted aboard Air Force One would backfire because documents would eventually surface showing that that meeting had been set up not to talk about adoption policy it had been set up for the explicit purpose of the Trump campaign getting political dirt about Hillary Clinton from the Russians according to Mark karelas account hope Hicks responded that the emails setting up the Trump Tower meeting for that purpose will quote never get out those emails will never get out because only a few people had access to them Mark karela told colleagues he was alarmed by what Miss Hicks had said either she was being naive or she was suggesting the emails could be withheld from investigators he told colleagues he was also alarmed that she had made this comment about the emails never getting out in front of the president without a lawyer on the phone which means that conversate could never be protected by attorney-client privilege and that is what led mark Carillo to quit as the spokesman for the Trump Russia legal defense now hope Hicks had a lawyer put out a statement saying that's not at all how it happened she totally denies this account but if more Carollo is right and all of the people he contemporaneously confided in about that incident can back him up potentially in a court of law the way they backed up his story to the New York Times then that that incident with that statement about Trump Tower that ends up being really important for a couple of reasons I mean first of all obviously it's just the the plot and the press drama that derived from this incident it was a matter of like a day before Donald Trump Jr's emails setting up that meeting in order to get dirt on Hillary Clinton it was only a matter of like a day before those emails in fact came out revealing that the president's dumb adoption statement trying to cover up the purpose of that meeting was an overt lie so obviously that's an immediate consequence of that's that that whole story but more importantly there is potentially a very serious legal problem here right the president is widely believed to be the subject of a special counsel investigation into whether or not he has obstructed justice by trying to impede or or block or pervert the Russia investigation through various means at the time that that Air Force one discussion happened last July where they're trying to cook up an explanation for the Trump Tower meeting and the president and everybody were well aware that the special counsel was investigating Russia's interference in our election and whether the Trump campaign was involved in it they knew this was a matter under investigation when they were trying to come up with an explanation that would get people off the scent of that meeting I mean if Mark Corallo is right and on a conversation that involved her mark Corallo and president Trump hope Hicks said that the emails revealing the true nature of that meeting those emails would never get out that would seem to indicate that she thought those emails could be kept from the investigation they could be kept from the special counsel in his investigators somehow either bite you know hiding them or destroying them or some other means if you do that in full knowledge that there's an active FBI investigation looking at those matters and you're talking about oh we can keep those emails from getting to the investigation I mean that that could very easily be criminal obstruction of justice and if that discussion those emails will never get out if that discussion involved the President himself that could very easily implicate the President of the United States in criminal obstruction of justice if in fact he were in on that call while that discussion happened and that's what Mark Corallo says happened and after those conversations with Mark karela quit I'm out I'm not doing this anymore and in that news story that the New York Times published about this one month ago today feels like 20 years ago it's a month ago today we got one other very important piece of information about Mark karela quote according to three people with knowledge of the request mr. Corrado received an interview request last week from special counsel robert muller and he has agreed to the interview according to the three people with knowledge of the request quote mr. Corrado is planning to tell Moeller about this previously undisclosed conference call with President Trump and hope Hicks he plans to tell investigators that Hicks said during the call that Donald Jr's emails about the Trump Tower meeting quote will never get out in other words Mark Corallo and all the people he contemporaneously memorialized this experience with he's planning to testify to Muller that what he saw in his interactions with hope Hicks and President Trump looked to him like obstruction of justice and he was there and he saw it and he's willing to testify about it and by the way he quit over it that reporting about Mark karela was a month ago since then mark rlo has had his interview with Robert Miller there's no reason to believe that he changed his mind as to what he was going to tell Muller and his investigators and now things seem to be moving very quickly The Washington Post first to report that another person who Muller wanted to talk to about that same incident was Josh Raffel White House spokesman who works closely with trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner quote hope Hicks and Josh ruffle were both involved in internal discussions in July over how to respond to questions about the Trump Tower meeting during the presidential campaign in June 2016 so molars team formally asked the White House to interview Josh ruffle nobody's confirming specifically whether that Josh raffle interview happened but White House Russia lawyer Ty Cobb had said that all the White House personnel who were going to be interviewed by Miller have completed their interviews so presumably that means Josh Rael has talked to Miller as well well yesterday Josh raffle quit his job at the White House he quit while hope Hicks was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee for nine hours during her nine hours of testimony yesterday she refused to answer any questions about anything that happened after the election which includes all sorts of stuff but that time period would certainly include those Air Force one discussions last summer hope Hicks his testimony was conducted behind closed doors but it made headlines anyway when she reportedly told the committee that her work for president Trump has sometimes required her to tell quote White Lies on his behalf the way The Times wrote that wrote up that revelation is itself revealing a hope Hicks White House communications director told House investigators that her worked for President Trump has occasionally required her to tell white lies but after extended consultation with her lawyers she insisted that she had not lied about matters material to the investigations into Russia's interference in the presidential election and it's possible links to Trump associates so she said yeah working for Trump has required me to lie I have lied about some stuff but after extensive consultation extended consultation with their lawyers she is ultimately able to say that she hasn't been lying specifically about the investigation that was yesterday today hope Hicks quit as well so the deputy communications director quit yesterday communications director quit today and there are a few things about this that may end up being very important right part of this is personal for the president hull pics is the longest standing and reportedly the closest staffer to the president at least the one who is not related to him by blood or marriage she's closer to him than anybody else other than his kids she and Josh raffle both started off working at a New York PR firm where she was doing public relations for Ivanka Trump she ultimately made the leap to go work for Ivanka Trump's private this and then that's the position from which she moved on to the Trump campaign so she comes from the Jared and Ivanka side of Trump world she's been with the Trump family in one way or another for several years now her departure of course happens at a particularly different difficult time for it for Jared and Ivanka when when Jared in particular has been publicly humiliated and effectively demoted in the White House in a still evolving scandal related to his inability to obtain a permanent security clearance I say he has been humiliated not because I'm trying to be mean or insulting I say it almost in a technical sense literally this is a headline at cnn.com tonight look the White House chief calligrapher now has a higher security clearance than Jared Kushner does that is not the onion that is CNN that is literally true and the while this while Jared's difficulties mount including this news story from the New York Times tonight about him and his companies receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in investment after he took White House meetings with executives from those companies the Jared and Ivanka part of Trump world have they've been losing people left and right Josh raffle was technically a deputy communications director at the White House but what he really was was a spokesperson for Jared and Ivanka he quit as of yesterday another close friend of Jared and Ivanka who was put in charge of the office of American innovation guy named Reid Cordish he also just announced that he's quitting and now hope Hicks is out as of tonight as well the security clearance controversy that is so clobbered Jared Kushner over these last few days that of course was sparked by hope Hicks's reported boyfriend in the white house rob porter who was fired by the White House three weeks ago after the publication of serious domestic violence allegations against him seriously that was only three weeks ago doesn't it feel like a million years the other way to see this hope Hicks story tonight though is just the math of it the massive massive turn of high-ranking high-profile and important people in this administration people who have already been chewed up and spat out barely one year into this president being in office we literally got a bigger wall we've been keeping this running list of the people who have been turfed out of this administration thus far I am NOT going to read this entire list again because God they gave me one set of vocal cords and how often can I do this but let me just update you on this this part of a list about the White House communications office why nots Communications Office has now lost press secretary assistant press secretary the White House director of rapid response the communications director then another communications director now another communications director with hope Hicks tonight and the assistant communications director with Josh raffle yesterday and if we're being complete about this since the last time we updated this list on the air when the associate attorney general Rachel Brandt left you can now also add the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke could just enough she's leaving the Special Representative for North Korea policy the top American diplomat of North Korea who's also announced he's leaving after 30 years plus that guy Reed Cornish the Jared of Jared and Ivanka guy who is running the office of American innovation plus the senior advisor to the Secretary of Defense Sally Donnelly who's just left James Madison's staff at the Pentagon as well I mean at one level this is hilarious that's ridiculous they've only been there a year but it is not normal for the United States of America to have this much instability and high level turnover and churn at the White House and even though we have now come to expect it because this is what it's been like it still somehow feels like a bigger deal than most that hope Hicks in particular is out just because on a personal level it's almost as hard to imagine her leaving this president as it would be to imagine the president's children leaving him as well but maybe they're on their way out now to now that they've been stripped of their security clearances it's hard to imagine how they will keep their jobs without them not if they have to ask the calligrapher to steal them secrets right when the New York Times first reported hope Hicks his departure tonight the paper reported Hicks's claim that she wasn't leaving over anything in particular she's been thinking about this for a while now you know there's never a good time to go but she is quitting the day after she gave 9 hours of testimony on the Russia investigation and it is hard not to see this departure not just as a big deal but it's something that may be related to what else is going on in this helter-skelter tumultuously house and specifically what is going on with the investigation into it we're very important new reporting suggests that the investigation has just taken a sharp turn to what the White House has to know is the worst part of this scandal for them and that is next hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can
