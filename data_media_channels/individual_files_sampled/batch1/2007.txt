I've lived here at the same house in Battersea for four years now it's been amazing it's been a slice of everything that I've wanted in a house I moved from living in a flat just around the corner actually I wanted a garden and actually for about ten percent more I found that I could have this amazing a four-bed house and with no neighbors above or below me and previously I'd had lots of noise so suddenly had a house which was quiet it's like something out of Alice in Wonderland it's like soon as you step in through the door that's it's deceiving how how big it is I think when renovating properties particularly in London where you know space is it's such a premium it's looking at that context where we are not in the countryside where you've got kind of a blank canvas to work with you've got to really respond to what's around you and maximize what you can just transform the space add more space add additional bedrooms so it originally was just two bedrooms and we added them for two but then always just make it feel more spacious inside so we created this kind of what's been dubbed the kind of ski slope roof so it's this continuous sloped roof that gives kind of quite a unique appearance at the rear but the the key things we brought to it we're trying to kind of maximize natural light and maximize the center space and try and make it feel more spacious and roomy inside it's up to people that be interested in a house like this are ones that are probably interested in design and interested in you know interesting and unique spaces I think it's the uniqueness that were really appeals to people people that want to not just by your regular Victorian terraced house they want to buy something unique that they can bring their friends around to in surprising ways you
