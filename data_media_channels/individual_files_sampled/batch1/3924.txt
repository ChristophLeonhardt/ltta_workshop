and on the equity side you said earlier in the year that the stock market maybe had gotten ahead of itself in terms of betting on the success of various administration policies that might give the economy a boost where are we now obviously a lots changed since last summer it seems like things are changing everyday where are we now so it's a very interesting thing in terms of the market sentiment I would say at the beginning of the year without a doubt there was kind of the famous Trump trade that came on which was a belief in tax cuts and infrastructure and deregulation as a package driving growth we saw over the first quarter and the second quarter that trade really went to zero I think the the basic belief that that would happen diminished a great deal in investor's mind of course at the same time the real economy sort of in a different parallel universe from politics was doing even better and so real growth rates were picking up and so a general belief that the economy was doing better began to take over market sentiment and so I would say the market was driven higher by that belief not really related to the Trump policies now in the last two weeks we've started to see that shift again and I do think that with the at least outline of a tax plan on the table you've begun to see some of the earlier Trump trade animal spirits start to come back in but for most of the year I would say that really hasn't been a factor in the market
