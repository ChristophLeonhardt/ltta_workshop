1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:02,688
(jazz music)

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,560
- [Interviewer] Who has had the greatest

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,883
influence on you and why?

4
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:13,713
- Probably my parents.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,600
Because they taught me
that if you love something

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,230
you'll work hard at it, and the only way

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,580
to be great at something
is working hard at it.

8
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:23,743
- My brother.

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,900
He was mentally ill, and
he taught me a lot about

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,673
the reality and the richness of diversity.

11
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,653
- Probably my mom.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:36,993
And my dad.

13
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,080
My dad because he's a
professor of physics,

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,410
and so he's very analytical,

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,690
and good at approaching
problems in a systematic way.

16
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,150
And then my mom, because
she's always up for fun,

17
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,520
and doing something a little crazy,

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,940
and a little bit untraditional.

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,323
And so I think I have both sides to me.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,023
- My dad, by far.

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,408
He's given me some of the best business,

22
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:04,120
and career, and professional advice,

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,070
and he was always been my mentor,

24
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,293
my hero,

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,513
my friend.

26
00:01:14,696 --> 00:01:16,613
- Every time I was with my dad,

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,046
even up to this day, he
finds the person in the room,

28
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:23,413
who needs a kind word the most,
and makes sure he gives it.

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,933
- My father.

30
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:29,773
By all means that taught
me the value of hard work.

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,943
The value of doing right
for the first time.

32
00:01:33,498 --> 00:00:00,000
(piano music)
