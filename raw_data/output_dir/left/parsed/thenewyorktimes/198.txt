Colombian police
scour the streets
looking for undocumented
migrants.
All of them are Venezuelan,
selling whatever they can.
Water, work, sex.
The officers enter a
nightclub and round up
more than 30 prostitutes.
Jocelin, that’s her working name,
wants me to see a picture of
her nephew back in Venezuela.
She tells me he died of
malnutrition a month ago.
She’s hiding her
face from the camera
because her husband
and three children
don’t know how she pays
for the food they eat.
They think she’s in 
Colombia waiting tables.
I’m here in the border
town of Cúcuta
as Venezuela prepares to hold
its first presidential election
since Nicolas Maduro took
power and began silencing
his opposition, and since
the country’s oil-based
economy collapsed.
It caps a year in which hundreds
of thousands fled the country.
And so I thought if people can’t
speak freely inside Venezuela
perhaps they would here,
once they cross over
the border into Colombia.
But I quickly find
that people aren’t
thinking about the election.
They’re just trying
to survive.
The Simón Bolívar
International Bridge
is the busiest point
of exodus
for Venezuelans.
But it’s not a one-way street.
Thirty-five thousand
march across each day,
often going back and forth,
to buy basic things they can’t
get or afford in their country
like rice and toilet paper.
A shortage of
medical supplies has
hundreds of women coming
over just to have their baby.
But more and more
Venezuelans crossing
are just looking for a
new start somewhere else.
With so many Venezuelans
pouring in,
the Colombian government
stopped issuing temporary visas,
and this has made it harder
for refugees to
earn a living here.
Those fortunate to have
passports and enough cash
travel on to
other countries
where they hope
to find jobs.
The less fortunate scramble.
And rumors are
flying. A popular one
is that Americans are
paying for bus tickets
to other South
American countries.
I’m filming at
the bridge one day
when a woman
comes up to ask
if we’re the Americans
giving out aid.
Yuliana and Ivan took
a 14-hour bus ride
on a leap of faith that
this rumor was true.
Until a year ago,
they were still O.K.:
a comfortable middle-class 
family in Venezuela.
Then, out-of-control inflation
made living so expensive,
they were down to
one meal a day.
And then they lost
their apartment.
Now they’re homeless
on the street with a baby
and no prospect for work.
Once over the bridge,
they’re hit by the chaos
of this place known simply
as la parada, the stopping place.
It’s an unfortunate
but apt description
of what happens to many
families who flee,
only to find themselves
stuck here.
Like Hector Mendoza: He
left his farm in Venezuela
when he could no longer
find the seeds, chemicals
or tractor parts he
needed to keep it going.
He arrived in Cúcuta three months
ago with his pregnant wife
and two kids.
They’ve been camping
near the central plaza
for two months, surviving on a
diet of junk food and handouts.
He makes small change
holding places
in the long line for
Western Union.
At night his family beds down
on sheets of cardboard.
Mildred Rosales is trying to
buy her teenage daughter
a bus ticket to Peru.
She’s selling her
wedding ring to do it.
Just outside the jewelry shop,
another family says goodbye.
This time it’s the mother
who’s leaving to Peru.
Her son Yershey walks back to
Venezuela with his aunt and uncle.
Their plan is to keep
saving money until they can
afford to send someone else.
If President Maduro
solidifies his grip on power
and his country of
about 30 million
continues to suffer
from crime and poverty,
an even larger
exodus may be coming.
What happens in Venezuela
could destabilize
the entire continent.
