00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,752

94
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:36,294

96
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:39,864

104
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:51,642
WERE NO LONGER MANNING THE

105
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:52,810

106
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,779
ATTEMPT TO BREACH THE BORDER

107
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:55,513
THEY WOULD BE FINE.

108
00:02:55,513 --> 00:02:56,614
THEY'RE LYING TO THEIR OWN

109
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:56,947

110
00:02:56,947 --> 00:02:58,783

OPERATIVES.

113
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,920
THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE.

114
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,855
THIS IS WHAT TERRORISTS GROUP

115
00:03:04,855 --> 00:03:05,723
DO.

116
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:06,624
TERRORISTS GROUPS ATTACKING THE

117
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,292

118
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:08,993
GROUP.

119
00:03:08,993 --> 00:03:09,994

CHILDREN.

121
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,996

122
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:14,832
HUMAN SHIELDS THIS IS WHAT HAMAS

123
00:03:14,832 --> 00:03:15,099
WAS.

124
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,535
DURING THE LAST GAZA WAR, HAMAS

125
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:19,236
HID THE HEADQUARTERS INSIDE OF A

126
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:19,603
HOSPITAL.

127
00:03:19,603 --> 00:03:20,971
THIS IS WHAT TERRORIST GROUPS

128
00:03:20,971 --> 00:03:22,239
DO.

129
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,241
WHEN TERRORIST GROUPS GET A

130
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:25,776
CIVILIAN KILLED THEY ARE HAPPY.

131
00:03:25,776 --> 00:03:28,779
THE MEDIA COVERAGE THAT

132
00:03:28,779 --> 00:03:29,747
CIVILIANS ARE KILLED.

133
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:32,016
THE ISRAELIS ARE DEEPLY

134
00:03:32,016 --> 00:03:33,751
DEVASTATED BIT.

135

00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:10,721
EMPLOYER BY FAR OUT THERE.

152
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:11,222
THEY'RE FURIOUS.

153
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:12,857
THEY SAY, THEY PUT OUT A

154
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:14,125
STATEMENT, THEY SAY THE CITY

155
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:16,827
DOES NOT HAVE A REVENUE PROBLEM.

156
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:18,228
IT HAS SPENDING EFFICIENCY

157
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:18,562
PROBLEM.

158
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:20,564
IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S

159
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:20,865
TRUE.

160
00:04:20,865 --> 00:04:21,265
>> YEAH.

161
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:22,967
IT IS NOT JUST A SPENDING

162
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:23,501
EFFICIENCY PROBLEM.

163
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,236
THEY HAVE A MASSIVE REGULATORY

164
00:04:25,236 --> 00:04:25,569
PROBLEM.

165
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:27,438
WHAT THEY'RE USING THE HEAD TAX

166
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:29,073
MONEY FOR, THIS IS PROBLEM FOR

167
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:30,775
SEATTLE LITERALLY YEARS AT THIS

168
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:33,177
POINT, SUPPOSEDLY CURE THE

169
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:34,044
HOMELESS PROBLEM.

170
00:04:34,044 --> 00:04:35,913
THEY'RE SUGGESTING BECAUSE

171
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:37,481
AMAZON BROUGHT IN LOT OF

172
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:39,717
EMPLOYEES, DRIVING HOME PRICES

173
00:04:39,717 --> 00:04:41,452
UP, RENTAL PRICES UP WHICH IS

174
00:04:41,452 --> 00:04:42,753
TRUE, BUT THE REASON PRICES ARE

175
00:04:42,753 --> 00:04:45,156
GOING UP THERE, IS NO NEW

176
00:04:45,156 --> 00:04:47,958
ADDITIONAL SUPPLY FOR HOUSING

177
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:49,994
BECAUSE SEATTLE HEAVILY

178
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:51,962
REGULATES DEVELOPERS FROM

179
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:53,397
BUILDING NEW UNITS.

180
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:55,466
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SEATTLE IS

181
00:04:55,466 --> 00:04:56,534
NOT A PROBLEM.

182
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:58,636
THEY HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

183
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:00,104
SEATTLE ABUSED BY PEOPLE FOR

184
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,339
YEARS GOING BACK TO, I BELIEVE

185
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,941
THEY WERE CALLED DRUNK DORMS IN

186
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,775
SEATTLE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

187
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:06,177
ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE PEOPLE

188
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:07,878
WHO ARE ACTUALLY LIVING IN THESE

189
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:08,746
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.

190
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:11,015
THE PRICES CONTINUE TO GO UP.

191
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,316
HOMELESSNESS WILL CONTINUE TO

192
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:12,683
INCREASE.

193
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:14,585
GUESS WHERE HOMELESSNESS REALLY

194
00:05:14,585 --> 00:05:16,454
INCREASE BECAUSE WHEN AMAZON

00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:16,787
LEAVES.

196
00:05:16,787 --> 00:05:18,155
PLENTY OF STATES WILL BE HAPPY

197
00:05:18,155 --> 00:05:20,424
TO HAVE THEM WITHOUT LEVERAGING

198
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:22,293
A $75 MILLION A YEAR TAX.

199
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:23,060
AINSLEY: VICE PRESIDENT OF THE

200
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,562
COMPANY IS THINKING ABOUT THAT.

201
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,396
MAKING THEM SECOND-GUESS THE

202
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:25,763
DECISION.

203
00:05:25,763 --> 00:05:27,097
BRIAN: WHEN I THINK OF BEN

204
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:28,833
SHAPIRO I THINK OF SITCOMS, WHAT

205
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:30,201
HE LIKES TO WATCH.

00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:36,073
YEARS IN HIBERNATION, LAST MAN

208
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:37,208
STANDING COMING ON FOX.

209
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,476
HERE IS A LITTLE TEASE WHAT IT

210
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:39,310
WILL BE LIKE.

211
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,914
>> TELL ME THAT IS A CAT.

212
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:46,317
♪♪

213
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:47,017
WHAT THAT'S?

214
00:05:47,017 --> 00:05:49,987
>> GOT THE TATTOO, CAME HOME

215
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:51,155
FROM THE PROM PREGNANT.

216
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:55,726
>> SHE HAS A TATTOO?

217
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:57,695
OH.

218
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,230
>> ABC KICKED THEM TO THE CURB.

219
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,897
NO MORE.

220
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:01,131
FOX IS BRINGING THEM BACK.

221
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:04,635
AFTER THEY SAW HOW SUCCESSFUL

222
00:06:04,635 --> 00:06:05,069
ROSEANNE WAS.

223
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:06,937
>> NO QUESTION, CERTAINLY

224
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:07,671
ACCORDING TO EXECUTIVES ONE OF

225
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,073
THE DECIDING FACTORS WHICH MAKE

226
00:06:09,073 --> 00:06:11,775
AS LOT OF SENSE.

227
00:06:11,775 --> 00:06:14,745
"ROSEANNE" HAD A ENORMOUS BURST

228
00:06:14,745 --> 00:06:16,380
OUT OF THE GATE.

229
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,015
PEOPLE LOOKING AT PRESIDENT

230
00:06:18,015 --> 00:06:21,685
TRUMP, SOMEBODY ON TV WHO VOTED

231
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,454
FOR THE PRESIDENT TRUMP.

232
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:25,389
"LAST MAN STANDING" WAS ONE OF

233
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:26,690
THE FEW CONSERVE TOUGH SHOWS

234
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,959
THEN IT WENT AWAY.

235
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,530
IT MIGHT BE SMART FOR FOX TO

236
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,666
APPEAL TO OTHER HALF OF THE

237
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,200
COUNTRY.

238
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,202
BRIAN: IT IS NUMBER TWO COMEDY

239
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:40,638
IN THE COUNTRY WHEN THEY

240
00:06:40,638 --> 00:06:41,739
MYSTERIOUSLY CANCELED IT.

241
00:06:41,739 --> 00:06:44,475
>> IT IS NUMBER TWO, ARE THEY

242
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:46,043
CANCELING IT BECAUSE HE IS A

243
00:06:46,043 --> 00:06:46,477
CONSERVATIVE.

244
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:47,878
>> NO QUESTION THERE IS MASSIVE

245
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:49,580
BIAS INSIDE HOLLYWOOD.

246
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,715
I WROTE ENTIRE BOOK WHERE I

247
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:52,716
INTERVIEWED, PEOPLE IN

248
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,852
HOLLYWOOD, WRITERS, ACTORS,

249
00:06:54,852 --> 00:06:56,153
DIRECTORS, PRODUCERS, WHY THERE

250
00:06:56,153 --> 00:06:58,689
IS SO LITTLE CONSERVATISM IN

251
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:00,090
HOLLYWOOD, MANY ADMITTED ON TAPE

252
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,959
THERE IS OPEN DISCRIMINATION OF

253
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:04,094
HOLLYWOOD AGAINST CONSERVATIVES.

254
00:07:04,094 --> 00:07:05,796
THOUSANDS AN THOUSANDS OF

255
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:06,964
CONSERVATIVES WHO HIDE

256
00:07:06,964 --> 00:07:08,299
UNDERGROUND THEY ARE AFRAID THEY

257
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:09,900
WILL BE FIRED AS FOUND OUT AS

258
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,868
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T VOTE FOR

259
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:11,468
HILLARY CLINTON.

260
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,637
AINSLEY: TIM ALLEN SAID, BASES

261
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:16,206
ARE LOADED, MAN IS AT HOME PLATE

262
00:07:16,206 --> 00:07:17,474
ABOUT TO BAT, SOMETHING LIKE

263
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:19,710
THIS, AND HE SAID, AND THEN THEY

264
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,311
CANCELED THE GAME.

265
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:21,579
THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO US.

266
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:22,980
OUR RATINGS WERE SO GOOD.

267
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,683
AM I EXCITED?

268
00:07:25,683 --> 00:00:00,000
HE SAID, H-E-L-L HOCKEY STICKS.
