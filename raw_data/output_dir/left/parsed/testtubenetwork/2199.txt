An egg-producing farm is forced to kill 5.3
million chickens after a dangerous bird flu
outbreak.
The outbreak is the worst in U.S. history,
with more than 40 million birds killed in
16 states. Dozens of countries have banned
egg and poultry imports from the U.S.
Of the nearly 650 people infected
with H5N1 Avian Flu, about 60% have died.
The CDC is closely monitoring the virus for
potential mutations.
