Crouse with the daily wire today we have Ally Stuckey the conservative millennial and host of Ally on CR T V Ally it's great to have you join us thanks for having me thanks for making time for us today we got a lot of things to talk about today lots of breaking news these last couple of weeks there's never been a dull moment that's for sure no never it makes our jobs fun and exciting you don't have to talk about you know paint drying or something exactly so recent polling has shown that the majority of Millennials like you and I unfortunately view socialism in a positive light is there anything that conservatives can do to reverse this trend I think some of it is generational and honestly the farther away that we get from the Great Depression in the world wars the less we know about what it's like to go without and the importance of deferred gratification and the value of a dollar and work ethic we're just kind of far removed from the days when those things were absolutely necessary to survive which is why we've been coddled so much by prosperity and success which is a good thing but it's of course a double-edged sword so when you look at it in that historical sense it's kind of a daunting task for conservatives and Republicans to try to combat I mean we have generations and generations that have kind of built up to this however I really think that the biggest thing these days that appeals to Millennials about socialism is the perceived compassion and empathy that we're seeing I mean we saw at the young lady always forget her last name Acacio Cortes I think it's her last name that just won in 14th district in New York and the way that she came across was not that she knows a lot about economics or not that she knows ton about policy but that she was very empathetic to people who were different than her that she was going to fight on their begum and I think yes exactly and I think that's what Republican a Republicans can do a better job of communicating because if we believe that conservatism is good for you it's good for me then we do believe it's good for everyone we believe that it's good for you know the mom with three kids who's on welfare we believe that it's good for the homeless person we believe that it's really the only vehicle to prosperity and success and liberty is this idea of self-governance and liberty and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps so I think we can do a better job of telling stories of the testimonies of how conservatism and you know small government and lower taxes deregulation has actually led to prosperity and show that that's the action that's actually the empathetic stance to take not so what do you say then to those millennial leftists that say well if the government does it then who will I would look at the statistics that show that America is exceedingly generous exceedingly generous as a nation and also we never hear about the organizations that are doing this without any government help for example here in Dallas where I live there is an organization called clean slate that offers jobs a manual labor jobs for homeless people in the community helps them you know just make a little bit of money to get on their feet and really most importantly gain their dignity what socialists seem to not understand is that there is no dignity when you don't own your private property and when you're not really genuinely working for something which Acacio cortes what she wants is guaranteed federal jobs well that's just creating a superficial job that's not actually necessary and human beings are savvy enough to know on that if they're not necessary then they really have you know they have no meaning they have no real fulfillment and so to me socialism denies the very real unique characteristics of human nature and that's not only to own private property but also to work for something and you know socialism just doesn't allow that to happen up so now we have Justice Kennedy retiring it's the big news and the left is of course galvanizing their base by saying that yet you know the fifth conservative justice will mean the reversal verow v wade and apparently the end of the world as we know it didn't you know that you and I are living in Handmaid's Tale because that's what I learned this last week yes I feel very oppressed even more so do you actually seem I know lots of conservatives like our very own Michael Knowles is its touting that this will mean the reversal of Roe versus Wade do you see that happening I think it's absolutely a possibility and of course as someone who has adamantly pro-life I'm very optimistic and hopeful for that but even as someone who desperately wants see row v Wade overturned I think that we need to be careful not to say you know I want someone to be on the Supreme Court who is going to overturn roe v wade that's not the qualification for me the qualification is that they are an originalist that they you know fear in a healthy way the Constitution that they are a constitutionalist and I think that overturning roe v wade could be a consequence of that but that's not the number one thing that I'm looking for even though I've tweeted as much I've said you know just watch out we're gonna overturn roe v wade because that's what I want but that's not my number one characteristic that I wanted to put in a Supreme Court judge the most important thing I want is upholding the Constitution and if roe v wade is the consequence of that which i think it very well could be then I'm happy but I think it also speaks to the fact that the left has to know that roe v wade is constitutionally precarious if it wasn't if it was such settled law as they said if it really couldn't be overturned then they wouldn't be freaking out right now but they have to know it was a pretty bad decision and that's why it's so what's so funny to me though is how they want to say that things like this are settled law but then they also want us to claim that the Constitution is a living and breathing document that can mean whatever we want it to me so it's like pick a side that's because they believe that their subjective opinions are settled well I have nothing to do with the gossipy so based on you talking about you want to strict constitutionalist an originalist who on president Trump short lists are you favoring right now so I well I've heard mike lee which i think is great i don't think i'm not really sure that that's going to happen but his latest pick that we've heard a lot of hubbub about on CNN heard it of course i only know her first name which makes me a sexist it's a me and then Coneybear that's it yeah yes exactly um I really like her of course everyone on the lot to say you know it's just because she's a pretty woman is just because of the appearance of him winning of Trump Louisianans oh meterologist said that yesterday he insinuated that because Trump cares about what's that he would pick her which is just beyond sexist but of course he won't be called up for it of course and she's extremely qualified so I she's not necessarily my favorite pick just because she's a woman although yeah I do I think it would be cool to have the first servitude female justice sure that would be awesome if she is the most qualified but from what I have read about her she does seem very qualified so I'm glad that she's at least in the running and she would be there for a long time absolutely based on her age presumably and I mean now she's also being hit by Talking Heads over at CNN MSNBC for being quote/unquote too Catholic so I don't know what that means except it sounds really bigoted and offensive but anyway exactly but if it was the other way around if we were saying Oh someone's too Muslim or someone's too atheist to be on the Supreme Court then that would all have absolutely it would be headline news and on all the sunday shows for sure speaking of these justices though many conservatives it's this is just a fascinating case study to me because many conservatives despise speaker I'm sorry leader Mitch McConnell as a member of the swamp and yet it seems like he's done a great job at were you know placing conservative justices throughout the Judiciary not just with course at the Supreme Court so is Mitch a reason for all of this winning or is he a dangerous beltway's swamp creature I think it's impossible to deny that he has played a large part in helping and eating Trump's agenda he just has now is he had an establishment establishment Republican yes I mean I always think of Don Blankenship and his cocaine Mitch ad and talking about how you know Mitch McConnell aids China people and that he doesn't really put America first I think that's just a bunch of rhetoric that people like to say because he is an established home weekend in Washington people just assume that he's a part of the swamp but the fact of the matter is is that he has helped Trump with his agenda I do think that I think that we can trust him to put forth a conservative justice or an originalist justice okay so looking ahead to the November midterms do you sense that people will be voting for who they like more or that who they hate less because this is you know problem that we came across in 2016 I think that's a good question I mean I I think it'll probably be who people hate less you know but I say that but at the same time people might might be kind of over that they I don't know it's kind of it's kind of hard to say what I do think is that under estimating conservatives though who are so frustrated with what they're seeing on the left that they will actually get out and vote that their resistance is actually doing more work for Republicans and conservatives and they actually are for the left of course only time will tell with that but as it as it seems right now it looks like the blue wave is just a ripple that is crashing on the rocks of their resistance so hopefully that works in art those are very well scripted metaphor you just appreciate that you recently wrote how crazy it is that loving America is now apparently a political position well can you explain to our audience what you mean by that yeah I absolutely believe that now when you hear about someone being patriotic or loving America wanting to stand for the anthem which we could get on to the whole tangent and I won't but or have you know defending the military it's almost always a conservative or a conservative position I'm not saying no Democrats love America I'm not saying that no Democrats are patriotic but it's just a matter of fact I was on HLN the other day and I was on a panel with two Democrats one more moderate one super far left both of them said that they're not going to be celebrating 4th of July this year simply because they can't stand the state of our country which I think the state of our country right now is looking good whether you like Donald Trump or not but one of the one of my colleagues on the panel said that it's because of all of the racism and all of the oppression and everything that we've done in this country from the very beginning against black people so I think that a lot of people on the Left have this perspective that we are defined by our sins and defined by our imperfections whereas I choose to believe in most conservatives choose to believe that we are defined by our ability to overcome those imperfections in such a short amount of time and just the American grit that I think is so relentless and so irreplaceable and that's what makes our country unique and of course people on the Left also can't answer the question if our country is so awful if we are ruled by this racist white supremacist patriarchy why are you so eager to let everyone in why don't they stay in their awesome country of Guatemala if if our country is so bad then why are you so eager to let everyone into our borders they can't answer that question so I definitely think it's become a little issue unfortunately interesting so you tweet something the other day that I want to read to everyone you said my little girl just said to me Mom how is progress possible if our growth is stunted by perpetual tribalism and xenophobia Wow literally at a loss for words she's a German Shepherd I had no idea this was possible sorry it sounds like a real woke German Shepherd right there is this what she said she is very well look if you haven't noticed the Stuckey household is a very woke house I'm working on my Kovac my cats seem to have this like scary libertarian bent about them I'm at work that I'm trying to show them the beauty of socialism but quite honestly they're bigots they don't want to hang out with me they don't want to hang out with the dog it just makes a lot of sense for libertarians but my wolf German Shepherd he gets that she gets it I'm gonna say I was I was gonna say has she identified yet as your daughter justjust no yet no not quite but thankfully she understands the wolves that we're facing and Trump's America that's the that's the most I could ask for right now she's don't like I'm speaking of woes you just mentioned those lefties on the panel the other day when you are in TV who are not celebrating the 4th of July but the 4th of July my favorite holiday is indeed tomorrow and how are you going to be celebrating my husband and I are going to go to a lake and a lake house with my family and so we'll be celebrating with my brothers my nephews our dogs I'm sure that will eat hot dogs or something like that and just enjoy a day celebrating and thanking God for our freedom because it really is so rare that you know we're even able to do things like disagree that we're able to worship the way that we want to worship and that we're able to take a day off work and just enjoy family without you know any fear of really anything it's really amazing and I don't want to take it for granted so that's what we'll be sure to throw a beer and some country music listing into that too and it sounds like the perfect day well well thanks so much for being here with us Ally Thank You Lucia and thank you everyone for tuning in I hope you all have a great Independence Day you
