seven a venue for a change of views on key military issues it is the openness and constructiveness of the dialogue that allows us to achieve mutual understanding based on the Bella's own interests this point was repeatedly made yesterday by my Russian colleagues who presented their approaches to the relevant issues and on my part I would also like to share the assessment of that complex situation on the international arena since the dissertation in the world since the past year despite all our efforts continued to deteriorate the main reason which has others for everyone there is a continuous and unilateral steps of the Western countries are led by the United States which leads to the dangerous and this balance of global governance in Washington London and many other Western capitals they didn't learn any lessons from the Tredici because Lobby Rockley de Ukraine the strategy of national security in other states which was published recently but the situation is viewed through the prism of the military arrival in Russian terminology a friend or foe and a role of international institutions is the unplayed and the ability to maintain and the adherence of treaties arouses questions and there we saw that they try to undermine the comprehensive plan on nuclear Iran program Paris climate conference and the basic principles of a WTO we see some trends for revisionism and urine vegetation even Minsk Accords for the settlement of the Ukrainian Christ crisis put Santa doubts by the worst the sponsors of Ukraine in the United States and Europe close they arise on their violations of those air cores and in many regions of the world a doubtful and games with zero Salman in fact negative song I been continued and while the division of terrorists into good and bad guys I also continue and Russian representatives discussed that very detail layer in every detail on the basis of Syria and other Middle Eastern countries we have an impression that Americans try to maintain the state of controlled chaos over this vast geopolitical space trying to justify a US presence everywhere with their own agenda the Washington emphasizes their effort and the dominance and they and in undermining the parity the ABM principles are being aroused NATO exercises are being intensified along Russian borders and what is most concerning is the attempt of the other states to reduce the threshold of the use of nuclear weapons and problems in cyberspace being applied to article 5 of the Washington protocol and any attempts to start a serious dialogue on that matter had no response either in Washington or Brussels in order to further demonize Russia provocations are being arranged in a so-called scruples case and became the pretext stage pretext for unprecedented massive expulsion of Russian diplomats not only from Britain and the United States but from other countries that were made to the show and it is an open mocking at diplomatic ethics and we have not seen it for a long time I would like to stress that we will continue responding to those and from the steps but at the same time we would like to find the truth and we insist that fair unbiased investigation be held in line with all the principles of the Convention on the prohibition of new chemical weapons and we maintain that they will not be able to ignore our attacks and the special session of the organization on the prohibition of chemical weapons proved that it is unacceptable to continue with such acts as Salisbury case and instead of decent investigation just on substantiated accusations put forward it's only in a Carol's book the Queen demands that first the accused to be a sentence and then the jury will make their verdict but the Lewis Carroll wrote some humoristic book and the format of further tales but yesterday's events showed us that adult people do not believe in fairytales and we call upon our colleagues to review those issues and on the basis of fair investigation were fully prepared for that kind of an effort and yesterday President Putin stressed that one more time speaking at the press conference in Ankara the mountain tension initial mistrust leads to a strategic uncertainty provoked outrage and which is most dangerous it promotes the militarization of our thinking and finally it arouses the architecture of security based on the United Nation principles such a situation narrows opportunities for cooperation which is badly needed should we want to respond adequately to the challenges it will for all such as international terrorism organized crime drug trafficking proliferation and the global climate change and many other challenges the competent audience does not need to be told that over the past 25 years the international landscape has changed greatly and it continues to be changing quite rapidly new economic centres of power are being strengthened they have more and more political influence and they issue in a foreign policy in line with their national interest and no body is in a position to make them do otherwise so those countries would like just implementation of their aspirations it is our common interest that the polycentric world would not be a chaotic rather and it should show the positive dynamics enable NASA to establish a mutually beneficial cooperation for that now weather and we need to give up phobias disagreements in Kiril and neo-colonial ambitions we need to learn how to respect interests of each other how to establish a joint effort for the sake of the safe and prosperous future in other words we should understand that we need to democratize international relations at this present time Western colleagues calling themselves supporters of democracy but they try to avoid any democratic principles when they deal with other countries so under the circumstances Russia as an independent center of world politics promotes its agenda focusing on stability we are not imposing anything on everybody and building our relations with partners we are continuously guided by the principles of international law the central role of the United Nations we have respect for the interests of other nations and peoples were not interested in confrontation or triggering an arms race but Russia is going to defend its national sovereignty and national interests using the Intel rage of the means that we have in stock Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that including his points in the State of the Nation Address in March and what should understand that it's not going to be a one-way traffic and they will not be able to obtain their benefits at our expense in asian-pacific region in Asia and everywhere in the world the security should be equal and indivisible and we are standing for a broad and dialogue in order to support strategic stability in all it aspects accounting for all the factors that may impact it under the situation and president of Russia and deny the presence of Russian it states discussed that in their telephone conversation March 20 and we helped that we will not be engaged in some democratic games and will not be hostages to some main purposes so we need to play equal roles in disarmament and arms control processes on the basis of predictability we have concluded the destruction of the chemical weapons stockpiles in this country so we have fulfilled all our commitments on the respective treaty and we are calling upon this United States to gently resolve the problem of strategic launchers in Geneva we put forward our proposals on countering chemical and biological terrorism there is also a Chinese initiative callin for the Prevention of launching striking weapons into space and we are going to continue making contribution for the political settlement everywhere in the world including medalists Africa Korean Peninsula and we will continue to support stable partnership over the territories of independent countries have resonance of the deepening of integration that would help us to resolve the issues between our neighbors addressing the Federal Assembly President Putin are called upon all the countries to sit at the table of negotiations and give another thought to the matters of promote and security and stability the Shanta organizational cooperation makes its contribution the csto BRICS are also doing a lot
