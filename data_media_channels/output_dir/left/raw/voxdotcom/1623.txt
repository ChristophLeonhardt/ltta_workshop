00:00:01,699 --> 00:00:06,519
During the first week of this year, Islamist
militants captured a army base in Borno, Nigeria,

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:11,650
and reportedly massacred hundreds of civilians
in nearby towns. These satellite images show

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,160
the aftermath of the violence.
It was part of a string of escalating attacks

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,600
by Boko Haram — the same group that kidnapped
more than 270 high school students last year.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,800
The group dates back to 2001, but became much
more violent starting in 2009. In the past

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,000
few years, the attacks have grown increasingly
frequent and brutal, threatening to destabilize

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,640
Africa’s most populous country.
Boko Haram wants to replace Nigeria’s democratic

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,870
government with an extremist theocracy.
Still, because they operate out of the northeastern

9
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,020
states, most of their victims have been the
poorer, Muslim communities that live there.

10
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,660
Broadly speaking, Nigeria’s population is
split between Christians, mostly in the south,

11
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:54,880
and Muslims, mostly in the North.
This dates back to British colonial rule,

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,170
when distinct ethno-linguistic societies were
stitched together to form Nigeria’s current

13
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,829
borders.
Poverty, health, and literacy are worse in

14
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,609
the North than in the South and the violence
only contributes to the marginalization of

15
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:12,259
the region. Poor government, high unemployment
and low school attendance set the stage for

16
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:15,359
Boko Haram.
And the government’s security forces have

17
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,799
alienated much of the North by at times doing
nothing to stop the attacks and at other times

18
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,530
detaining and killing people indiscriminately.
An investigative report by Frontline revealed

19
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,490
that civilian militias working with the Nigerian
military have carried out mass executions

20
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,569
of seemingly innocent men..
The government’s inability to contain Boko

21
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:38,249
Haram became a major campaign issue in the
lead up to this year's national elections.

22
00:01:38,249 --> 00:01:43,539
Both President Goodluck Jonathan, and his
opponent, former dictator Mohammadu Buhari

23
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:48,329
promised to stamp out the insurgency.
Jonathan, a Christian, was already really unpopular

24
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,880
in much of the North. When he ran for office
in 2011, he violated an informal agreement

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,459
that the presidency would alternate between
a Muslim and a Christian every 8 years. Hundreds

26
00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:02,219
of people were killed in the riots that followed
that election.

27
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,119
So when Nigeria postponed the 2015 elections
by 6 weeks, citing security concerns, the

28
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,379
delay was viewed by many as a political move
to help Jonathan regain ground lost to his

29
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,260
opponent.
In the meantime, neighboring countries agreed

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,650
to send forces to battle Boko Haram, which
now controls most of the state of Borno and

31
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,180
has declared a “caliphate” there.
But ultimately it will take much more than

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:00:00,000
military force to make Nigeria inhospitable
to terrorism.
