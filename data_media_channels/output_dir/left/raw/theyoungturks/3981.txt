1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:03,160
"“If you’re ever in our area,
please stop by and be a part of

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,664
one our services, I promise ya
we’ll make you feel right at home."”

3
00:00:06,664 --> 00:00:10,468
This is Joel Osteen, a celebrity televangelist.

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:14,939
Every week Joel and his wife, Victoria,
preach the good word for good money...

5
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:20,745
their estimated net worth is $40 million to 
over 45,000 people in person, with millions

6
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:23,414
more watching his sermons on TV and online.

7
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:27,285
Joel is the lead pastor at Lakewood
Church, which is actually one of the biggest

8
00:00:27,285 --> 00:00:28,252
in the entire country.

9
00:00:28,252 --> 00:00:32,890
Now Lakewood Church is located in Houston,
Texas...the epicenter of Hurricane Harvey.

10
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,628
The hurricane has ravaged the city of Houston, 
flooding homes and highways, and has already

11
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:39,830
claimed a suspected 30 lives.

12
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,601
Luckily though, Lakewood church
has not been damaged by the category 4

13
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,670
storm because it sits on higher ground.

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,837
As you can see:

15
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:50,608
“"You see this? This is Lakewood.
I’'m in the front of the church.

16
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:54,378
The church is higher than the goddamn
freeway. Do you see the freeway?

17
00:00:54,378 --> 00:00:57,348
It’'s the freeway. You see.
That’s 59, the southwest freeway.

18
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,817
You see that car driving on it? It’s not closed."

19
00:00:59,817 --> 00:01:04,822
So naturally many thought Joel and his wife,
VIctoria would welcome those who

20
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:09,060
had to evacuate their homes and
seek refuge, with open arms

21
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,495
"I promise ya we’ll make you feel
right at home"”

22
00:01:11,495 --> 00:01:15,299
into the 16,000-seat arena that used to
be home to the Houston Rockets,

23
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,870
the basketball team that has
already donated $10 million to

24
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,106
the Harvey hurricane disaster relief fund.

25
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:27,111
"“We have to be good to people... see people
matter to god, people matter most to god."”

26
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:35,186
But apparently being good to people didn’t fit Joel
and Victoria’'s bottom line this year...

27
00:01:35,186 --> 00:01:39,690
since they kept the doors to Lakewood
Church closed amidst this disaster.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,961
Now many people have expressed their
outrage at the Osteens...who have claimed

29
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:48,165
that they didn'’t open their doors for those seeking
shelter because they were flooded themselves.

30
00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:50,735
"The doors are locked but you see
these vehicles? This is for the

31
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,337
few people that’s inside of
here, that’s inside of here

32
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:56,374
because it’s safe in here. You
see this? Let me go, let me try

33
00:01:56,374 --> 00:01:59,410
to get closer You see the
inside of that? It’s dry.

34
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,347
The upstairs area is right there.
It’s dry. You see that?”"

35
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:04,015
Whoopsie.

36
00:02:04,015 --> 00:02:08,151
But to be honest, I don'’t really understand why
people are so mad at Joel.

37
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:12,990
This dude takes millions of dollars a
year from people who want to feel closer

38
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,726
to God and find solace in times of hardship.

39
00:02:15,726 --> 00:02:18,329
Jesus said give to the poor,
this man takes from the poor.

40
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:22,133
And then has the audacity to say
he’'s speaking on behalf of god

41
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,434
when he says shit like this:

42
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:28,906
"“People send money, they buy the
product, or they support the ministry...

43
00:02:28,906 --> 00:02:33,110
ya know just an unbelievable amount
that keeps it all going”."

44
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,748
Because as many of you know...
Jesus too was quite the purveyor of merch.

45
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:41,585
So the fact that Joel didn’t practice
what he preached when Houston

46
00:02:41,585 --> 00:02:46,757
was in need shouldn'’t surprise or anger anyone...
this has been his shtick all along.

47
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:49,260
He uses his pulpit for profit.

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,663
Taking in the needy during times of
destitution? Not too profitable.

49
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:55,466
So the Lakewood Church doors
stayed shut so that Joel could

50
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:58,736
spend the time in his $10
million dollar home working on

51
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:02,239
his next book or special “walk
on water” skinny tea.

52
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,142
But like Joel so eloquently put it... “

53
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:09,647
"If you rely on people, you will be
disappointed. People will let you down.”"

54
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,849
Guess the writing was on the wall there...

55
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:16,320
Houston residents, Osteen parishioners,
and others with any semblance of

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,024
a moral compass alike, so
angered at the Pastor’s decision

57
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:23,127
to continue his money grubbing
ways, took to Twitter and other

58
00:03:23,127 --> 00:03:26,163
news outlets to express their
dismay at Joel’s decision.

59
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:30,835
This bad press was no bueno for the
Osteen family’s bottom line...so

60
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:34,038
all of the sudden, the
“flooding” in the church was

61
00:03:34,038 --> 00:03:37,007
fixed, air mattresses were
bought, and the church finally

62
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:38,008
opened their doors/…

63
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:40,244
Better late than never, I guess?

64
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:43,714
Since Joel’s “keep your doors shut to
the poor until you’'re publicly

65
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:47,051
shamed to open them” line might
not be inspirational enough for

66
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:49,620
you in this time of need, I
thought I’'d leave you guys with

67
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,590
one bible quote to really wrap this up:

68
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,092
Luke 16:19-25 says,

69
00:03:55,092 --> 00:03:58,729
“"There was a rich man who was
dressed in purple and fine linen

70
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,831
and who feasted sumptuously every day.

71
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:06,103
And at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus...
who longed to satisfy his hunger

72
00:04:06,103 --> 00:04:08,005
with what fell from the rich man’s table...

73
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:12,042
The poor man died and was carried away by
the angels to be with Abraham.

74
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,012
The rich man also died and was buried.”"

75
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:16,880
Hey! Jesus’ words, not mine...

76
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,351
Well we all know you don’'t want to be like Joel...
so you can donate to the Red Cross

77
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:25,756
to actually help the victims of
Hurricane Harvey by texting

78
00:04:25,756 --> 00:04:30,294
“HARVEY” to 90999 to donate $10
to the relief efforts.

79
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:34,231
You can also donate your time to
following me @HannahCranston

80
00:04:34,231 --> 00:00:00,000
and as always, thanks for watching TYT!
