That’s a frog embryo,
leaving its egg to 
enter the world,
and this embryo 
can hatch at will.
The red-eyed tree frog
lays its eggs on
a branch or leaf 
above the water.
Once they’re in the last 
third of their development,
they can launch 
early if they need to.
If a wasp — or worse, 
a snake — attacks the eggs,
that movement 
signals danger.
In seconds, the larvae can 
drop into the water
and swim away.
It seems like they just push 
their way out of the egg,
but researchers at 
Boston University say no.
The scientists did 
several tests,
including poking the egg 
to simulate an attack.
They found that an embryo 
first sends out a burst of
enzymes from glands 
on its snout.
Those enzymes dissolve part 
of the egg’s membrane,
then the embryo 
wriggles its way out
and escapes from the snake.
It’s a good defense:
In case of attack — hatch!
