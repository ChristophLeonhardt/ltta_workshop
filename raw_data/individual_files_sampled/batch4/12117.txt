McGann had said nothing injurious to the president during the 30 hours of interviews but Mr McGann's lawyer has offered only a limited accounting of what mr. McGann told the investigators according to two people close to the president that has prompted concern among mr. Trump's advisors that mr. McGann statements could help serve as a key component for a damning report by the special counsel robert muller which the justice department could send to congress according to two people familiar with the discussions what this suggests is that the Moller investigation is going to come up with nothing and then they're going to send a report to congress suggesting that the president acted badly and while he didn't formally obstruct justice which is a charge that has a very specific meaning and involves destruction of evidence or attempts to intimidate witnesses or some sort of witness tampering or perjury the president hasn't done any of those there's nothing to actually show the president has done any of those things despite that they'll send the damning report to Congress and then a Democratic Congress will be forced to try to impeach mr. Trump's lawyers realized on Saturday they had not been provided a full accounting after the New York Times published in an article describing mr. McGann's extensive cooperation in mr. Miller's office after mr. McGann was initially interviewed by the special counsels office in November mr. Trump's lawyers never asked for a complete description of what mr. McGann had said according to a person close to the president all of which actually speaks to the idea that Trump didn't feel like he had a lot to fear from Mullen right he let his lawyer over at the White House go and talk to Muller didn't have to do that he could have just claimed executive privilege he could have claimed that there was attorney-client privilege he could have claimed a lot of things that would have prevented McGann from actually having to go talk with Muller into any of those things which suggest that Trump doesn't feel like he really has all that much to hide and the nerd times continues in this vein for a very long time means that pages and pages of writing on this and there's really nothing comes out from it basically the only thing comes out from is that McGann's people are sort of leaking to the press it appears that Trump setup McGann for a possible obstruction charge and so McGann was talking to MOA that's that's the suggestion in in the actual article is that the the only thing of relevance here is that McGann felt pressured by Trump and therefore he wouldn't talk to the investigators so here's what the New York Times says in his article the time said mr. McGann had sure detailed accounts about the episodes at the heart of the investigation into whether mr. Trump obstructed justice in the Russia inquiry some of the episodes like mr. Trump's attempt to fire mr. Muller last summer would not have been revealed to investigators without mr. McGann's help the article set off a scramble on Saturday among mr. Trump's lawyers and advisors the president sequestered at his private golf club in Bedminster New Jersey solicited opinions from a small group of advisers and the possible repercussions from the article the president ordered mr. Giuliani to tell reporters the article was wrong but mr. Giuliani did not go that far in his television appearances as we'll see Giuliani went on national TV and said the president really has nothing to hide apparently Trump want him to go out and say that the articles were wrong in all of their major facts which apparently was not true in the end is there a lot here not really not really president Trump lashed out on Twitter here is what President Trump had to say about the article he said the failing New Times wrote a fake piece today implying that because White House Counsel Dan McGann was giving hours of testimony to the special counsel he must be a John Dean type rat but I allowed him and all others to testify I didn't have to I have nothing to hide okay so people are picking on the fact that Trump himself is suggesting that John Dean was a rat for those who don't know John gene was a White House attorney under Nixon he went he talked with Watergate investigators and it was very damaging to President Nixon but what Trump is actually saying here is the people are jumping all over him for this he's not wrong right he allowed John McGann to go and testify now people are saying at the neuro Times that Trump did this basically because he's ignorant and so he allowed him again to talk to Muller but again so what is that that's the opposite of obstruction that's him actually allowing his own people to go and talk with the Muller investigation by the way half a dozen people inside the administration have already talked to the Muller investigation like a lot of people for hours at a time and you know what I'm not sure they're gonna come up with anything but Trump is frustrated and I think that that's not completely off the off the rails he continues along these lines he says they've demanded transparency so that the rigged and disgusting witch-hunt can come to a close so many lives have been ruined over nothing McCarthyism at its worst yet Miller and his gang of Dems refused to look at the real crimes on the other side media is even worse okay again I understand why Trump is upset about this he said my lawyer went and talked to Muller and you guys are yelling at me for that and saying that I'm obstructing even though my guy went and talked yeah I don't think Trump is wrong I don't think Trump is wrong again the the the sort of implication that Trump is trying to hide something when he allows his counsel to go and talk with with the Muller investigation is a weird one nonetheless Rudy Giuliani was out there making the rounds and sort of demonstrating that Trump was is upset about the media coverage and Giuliani is just not a good representative for the president this is one of the big problems with representing President Trump is that every attorney who has ever represented Trump ends up being undercut by Trump Trump goes on Twitter and then blasts out what he thinks anyway Rudy Giuliani however makes things worse Giuliani is sort of the straw that stirs the drink when it comes to media coverage he was talking about McGann and he makes a good point about McGann and then he gets to some much worse points here's Rudy Giuliani over the weekend with Chuck Todd of NBC you don't know how to percent of what he testified to Muller I think that through through through John dad we have a pretty good sense of it in John dad yesterday said I'll use his words rather than mine that McGann was a strong witness for the president so I don't need to know much more about that okay so if McGann was a strong witness for the President and McGann went and talked to the special counsel and in the end the special counsel has to prove obstruction the the fate not intent not intent to obstruct actual obstruction Andrew McCarthy makes this great point over at National Review today obstruction is an actual statutory crime if you're going to prove obstruction you have to prove that the president actually took acts designed to stop or meddle with the investigation there is nothing to suggest he actually took these acts he said stuff but saying stuff does not constitute obstruction the president has the ability to say as much stuff as he wants he just can't commit perjury and he can't actually engage in witness intimidation that's not the same thing hey Giuliani then goes on he says Robert Muller is panicking and this time McGann leaked shows it here's where Giuliani starts to shade over into a little bit of dicey territory it could be McGann and McGann's not doing it and he would have done it a long time ago if he was gonna do it they're down to desperation time they have to write a report and they don't have a single bit of evidence okay so it is very possible the Miller has no evidence that New York Times report however looks like a leak from McGann's team it looks like McGann is leaking to the press that the reason that he talked to Muller is because he was afraid of being hung out to dry it would be weird if that leak was coming from Team Muller they're just sentences in the report that appeared that it makes it look like it's from them again and then Giuliani gets himself in the biggest trouble of all now what Giuliani says in this particular clip is gonna be wildly misinterpreted I don't think Giuliani is completely wrong but expressed in the worst possible way and in a second I'm going to talk about why this sort of stuff matters and when you tell me that you know he should testify because he's going to tell the truth that he shouldn't worry well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth not the truth he didn't have a a conversation this Trump I don't be to go like I know it isn't truth truth isn't truth the president itíd state says I didn't truth is a truth mr. mayor do you realize what I know don't do this to me okay here's the problem with with Rudy Giuliani what he's saying is not wrong when he says that there is such a thing as a perjury trap that if I told the truth in front of Robert Muller I still may be brought up on obstruction charges I still may be brought up on perjury charges because it's possible there are two people who are telling different sides of the same story and one of them sees it a different way and therefore a perjury charge emerges he's not wrong about that but when he says sentences like truth isn't truth that is not going to help in any way Rudy Giuliani is just not a good representative of the president when it comes to this sort of stuff what he should be saying is no lawyer worth his salt would put his clients in front of a vey motivated prosecutor determined to rack that guy up on perjury charges or obstruction charges no one would do that particularly not a president who was fond of speaking off-the-cuff so even if the president is in general telling the truth and he makes a slight slip-up Moe's gonna grab him and not only that questions can be asked that are specifically designed to elicit a particular response that makes you subject to perjury a good prosecutor can do this sort of stuff but saying truth isn't truth obviously lends itself to the idea that the Trump administration is being deeply dishonest about all the stuff now the irony is that because the Trump administration has been dishonest about so many things regarding the Russia investigation from the outset it's obscuring the larger point which is that Trump I think is probably telling the truth when he says there was no collusion but this stuff does have consequences I'm gonna explain in just a second first let's talk about whether you ought to go down to the post office today the answer is you shouldn't can post office a great place but you don't actually want to be standing in line at the post office what you want to do is save your company

code Shapiro okay so and why does any of this matter in the end in the end it's all going to be dependent on what Muller comes down with so for all the media fomentation for two years of media fulmination all that's gonna matter is what's in the final report I have a feeling it's gonna be a lot weaker than anybody thinks it's going to be on the Left I think that it's still going to be damning of President Trump in terms of his own personal behavior and I don't think much is gonna come out of it it's just going to be a rien sort of a restating of stuff people already knew the big problem however is that when Rudy Giuliani goes on TV and says things like truth isn't truth all it's doing is underscoring the dishonesty of the Trump administration time and time again during the Russia collusion investigation the broader point the Trump is making I did not with the Russians to change the effects of the election I think is probably true because there has not been evidence presented yet to show that the Trump campaign actively colluded with the Russians in shifting the election there is attempt there is intent that's not the same thing as active collusion and coordination to violate the law in pursuit of changing the electoral result but because the Trump administration because the Trump campaign was so dishonest about the Trump Tower meeting for example because Rudy Giuliani has shifted his story multiple times it makes Trump look dishonest and it occurs to me what a problem is says yesterday I took my wife for her birthday glass blowing so we'd never done this before and and my sister actually suggested this we'd like to do sort of arts and crafts sorts of things but this is a new thing we like to do kind of experiences for birthdays and anniversaries instead of me just getting her a nice piece of jewelry or in addition to me getting her a nice piece of jewelry but in any case we decided to go glass blowing and the woman is teaching the class is of course as you imagine in Los Angeles somebody who's very much on the left and we start talking about politics because she brings it up I was not all that interested but she wanted to and so he started talking about politics and she started talking about what a bad guy Trump was and I said but his policies really haven't hurt you in any way in fact the economy's been pretty good yeah his policies are stuff that you kind of like and she's you know who else I just like that Mike Pence that Mike Pence is just terrible I said well you know I know the vice president pens he's actually kind of a nice guy and the idea that he is some sort of grave granthia crap attempting to govern you from above I just don't think that's true and then she starts launching into Mitch McConnell and after a little while of this it occurred to me the policy just doesn't matter when it comes to people voting the vast majority of people vote and think based on their personal like or dislike of particular people and candidates people don't think in terms of policy people don't think in terms of truth or falsehood in the Russian collusion investigation all they think is is Trump dishonest or is Trump not dishonest and so even if Rudy Giuliani is not wrong about perjury traps and Robert Muller when you represent the worst face to the public that has serious electoral consequences that stuff that doesn't get brushed under the rug when it comes time for people to vote the grand perception of President Trump is a dishonest guy is not going to be dissipated by the constant reiteration by his counsel Rudy Giuliani of that sort of diss honesty and that feeling of dishonesty it's this miasma of bad stuff surrounding the Trump administration that does more harm than the actual criminality cuz I don't think there's actual ending criminality when it comes right down to it okay meanwhile the media of course have every interest in blowing up everything bad about President Trump to inordinate heights of outrage and that's not helping either so the media continue to take very seriously Omarosa Manigault even though she has had nothing and that's what's really astonishing about the Omarosa Manigault story so Omarosa is going around talking incessantly about all of the tapes she has she has not released one seriously damning thing about the Trump administration she really hasn't now all she said is that she did get along with Trump she can get along with John Kelly and now she says Trump was a racist after spending years talking about a wonderful president Trump was and had removed literally bow before him now she's going around and she has earned strange new respect from the media so she's gotten most of that strange new respect courtesy of the folks over at places like MSNBC in a grand meeting of the minds al Sharpton had on Omarosa on MSNBC over the weekend and they were talking about race from Al Sharpton a man who is legitimately participated in the inception of race riots in places like New York Rama roasted talking with Al Sharpton race baiter par excellence about why Donald Trump is gonna start a race war we have a lot to lose and in fact we're losing right now because Donald Trump is disingenuous about his engagement in his outreach in effect I believe he wants to start a race war in this country no for a lady who was fired from the administration did not quit it's pretty wild for her to suggest that Trump wants to start a race war in the country it's particularly rich for her to be saying this to a guy who legitimately has started race riots in the United States who at least allegedly been involved with the inception of those race riots particularly the 1991 race right and Crown Heights that claimed the life of North Attacks Jew but I guess that the media have to be treated with respect her al Sharpton certainly has to be treated with respect the worst battery of Al Sharpton's weekend was not actually his interview with Omarosa it was the lead-up to his interview with Omarosa this is real I'm not making this up this is a thing that actually happened on national television is it fair to say al Sharpton is a dummy I think that based on Clips like this the the ongoing battle between Al Sharpton and his teleprompter is one of the great battles in human history I mean it really is like the it's like the Battle of Stalingrad really gal sharpton versus his teleprompter so here is the best clip of the weekend Bar None it's just fantastic you know what they say about paybacks it's a real well you I'm sure you know the word I'm thinking of so in the words of my late friend Aretha Franklin and show some our ESP ICT oh my goodness well you just hope that out al Sharpton is never in a position where he's on wheel of fortune and you have the art of the s the P to C on the T and then you has to buy a vowel because my goodness are it's literally on most payments so on RESP i CT tell us what it means to el Sharpton ah just fantastic stuff I can't imagine why folks don't take the media seriously but again the media continue to to portray the Trump administration as a place in flux and chaos they continue to give lots of respect to people like John Brennan a guy who lied to Congress a guy who was involved in basically smuggling classified information over to John over to Harry Reid in the Senate so he could make trouble for during the last campaign here was John Brennan on national TV talking about Trump is treasonous so the media are all in on the idea that Trump is is a treason a treasonous fellow the reason again this is relevant is because the Trump team has to fight back on that perception and making batteries with Rudy Giuliani is not the way to do this I called his behavior treasonous which is to betray one's trust and to aid and abet the enemy and I stand very much by that claim you are the former CIA director accusing the sitting president United State that's that's monumental accusation well I think these are abnormal times and I think a lot of people have spoken out against what mr. Trump has done and maybe it's my my warning training as an intelligent professional I have seen the lights blinking red in terms of what mr. Trump has done and is doing now as possible the left can go too far even for the left so James clapper who was a former head of the CIA I believe under under Barack Obama the clapper actually started talking he's former Director of National Intelligence under President Obama even he says that Brennan has gone too far here so even as the Trump campaign the Trump team Rudy Guiliani fail on their lines folks on the left are failing on theirs right so so John Brennan starts ripping into James clapper and he's exactly correct heard the opposite clapper starts ripping on Brennan and he's exactly right here you know john is sort of like a freight train and he's gonna say what's on his mind but John and his rhetoric have become I think an issue in and of itself so just great stuff there the fact is that the left are attacking themselves over how far they can go over president Trump again the focal point of politics has become the President of the United States it's the job of the President of the United States to make himself more popular it's the job of the left to make him more unpopular every time the left goes too far it makes Trump more popular every thought every time president Trump sends out Rudy Giuliani to botch the message on national television it makes Trump less popular that is the battle that's going on it's a battle of incompetence people beating each other with sticks it's it's it's really a clown show out there and on the highest possible level the only way this is ever gonna get sorted out is the next ballot box and that is a problem for Republicans because again the president's popularity rating is not as high as it should be right now given the geopolitical situation okay in just a second I want to talk about the me2 movement and whether it is foundering on the rocks of its own radicalism first let's talk about your safety and your security so ring Tom's mission is to make neighborhoods safer today over a million people use the amazing ring video doorbell to help protect their homes ring nose home security begins at the front door it does not end there so now they've extended that same level of security to the rest of your home with the ring floodlight cam just like that amazing doorbell floodlight cameras and motion activated camera and floodlight it connects right to your phone with HD video and two-way audio that lets you know the moment anyone steps on your property I love my ring doorbell I mean it's just it's fantastic the video doorbell it means that when I'm out of town somebody can ring the doorbell it pops up on my phone I know who's outside my house which is a big thing for me I'm very safety oriented ring calm can do that for you except extend it all the way across your property with the floodlight cam as well with the floodlight cam when things go bump in the night you will immediately know what what it is whether you're home or away the ring floodlight cam lets you keep an eye on your home from anywhere ring floodlight offers the ultimate in home security high visibility floodlights a powerful HD camera that puts security in your hands with ring you are indeed always at home save up to one hundred and fifty bucks off a ring of security kit when you go to ring.com slash that's ring.com / Bennigan's ring.com / menus that / been so we know we sent you and so you get that special deal 150 bucks off a ring of security kit love my ring dot-com products and you will to go check it out ring comm slash been for that special deal okay so the other big story of the weekend is that Asia Argento who is one of the lead figures in the me2 movement it turns out that she was actually involved in paying off a seventeen-year-old for sexually assaulting him in a California hotel room here is the story from the New York Times the Italian actress and director Asia Argento was among the first women in the movie business to publicly accuse the producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault she became a leading figure in the hashtag me - movement her boyfriend the culinary television star Anthony Bourdain eagerly joined the fight but in the months that followed her revelations about mr. Weinstein last October miss Argento quietly arranged to pay three hundred and eighty thousand dollars to her own accuser Jimmy Bennett a young actor and rock musician who said she had sexually assaulted him in a California hotel room years earlier when he was only two months past his seventeenth birthday which would be statutory rape she was 37 the age of consent in California is 18 that claim and the subsequent arrangement for payments are laid out in documents between lawyers for Miss Argento and mr. Bennett a former child actor who once played her son in a movie the documents which were sent to the New York Times through encrypted email by an unidentified party include a selfie dated May 9th 2013 of the two lying in bed as part of the agreement mr. Bennett who is now 22 gave the photograph and his copyright to Miss Argento now 42 three people familiar with the case said the documents were authentic miss Argenta is and her representatives have not responded to any of this mr. Bennett who lives in Los Angeles would not agree to be interviewed as he said his lawyer Gordon SOT row in the coming days Satchmo wrote in an e-mail Jimmy will continue doing what he has been doing over the past months and years focusing on his music mr. Bennett is a child actor who charmed Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis earned the nickname Jimmy two takes because he rarely flubbed his lines the 2013 hotel room encounter was a betrayal that precipitated a spiral of emotional problems according to documents the fallout from a sexual battery was so traumatic and hindered mr. Bennett's work and income threatened his mental health mr. Argento subsequently turned to miss Goldberg who's a lawyer to handle the case mr. Bennett's Notice of Intent asked for 3.5 million dollars in damages for the intentional infliction of emotional distress lost wages assault and battery mr. Bennet made more than 2.7 million in the five years before the 2013 meeting with Miss Argento his income has since dropped to an average of 60 grand a year and he attributes that to the trauma with regard to to this particular incident so that's really really ugly stuff now a lot of people are using this to try and discredit the broader me to movement suggesting that if Asia Argento has been responsible for the sort of sexual battery herself and covered it up that the credibility of some of the leaders of the Miche movement is compromised there's no question that her credibility is compromised but the idea of the metes and movement which is that sexual assault is bad is obviously true but again radicalism tends to discredit the main ideas underlying some good movement and this is what we're seeing in politics is what we're also seeing with cases like the me2 movement speaking of radicalism there's an article in The New York Times again it's amazing the most motivated people the most motivated people in life tend to be the people who are radical those also tends to be the people who are most likely to undermine the mainstream credibility of their own message most people if they move on issues want to be moved incrementally they don't want to have things shoved in their face they don't want radical shifts in the way they think about things but radicals by nature want to shift things radically the way people think about things the problem is those radicals very often end up alienating the very people that they seek to draw in the latest example from the New York Times there's a full article in The New York Times I'm not kidding it it's by a woman a person named sana are not sure if this is a man or a woman the article is titled witchcraft in the me2 era if you want to make the case for me too if you wanna make the case against sexual assault you probably don't want to start with witchcraft mmm witchcraft in the me to ear is actually basically the plot of the crucible by Arthur Miller but the New York Times reports Leslie in a secluded nook of Central Park thirteen witches studentís circle on a cloudless Saturday eyes close chanting a makeshift altar on the forest floor burl dancer in a silver chalice a bowl of water a jar of salt a sunflower and a wand Denice crutchy High Priestess of the North will would coven and her coven mate Joanne Ferrer guided the group through midsummer an annual ritual celebrating the summer solstice in a billowy white skirt and flip-flops ms crew she resembled a free-spirited flower shop I do love the romance that the New York Times gives witchcraft and people who are crazy because they're part of a coven I do love that they don't talk this way about Jewish ritual they don't talk this way about Catholic ritual they don't have to play about Protestant ritual but a bunch of nuts gathering the middle of Central Park get this sort of treatment from the New York Times and then they wonder why maybe the me2 movement is stalling out a little bit here when you undermine your own credibility by embracing radical silliness this is sort of what happens the Temple of the spiral path which includes the North willed wood and stranger gates covens has performed rituals in this clearing known among the witches as the green cathedral for 20 years the worshiper sat cross-legged around a circle of flowers dried kulinda chamomile lavender and rose petals carefully arranged in a spiral miss Cruz he led them through meditation then they slowly joined hands and began singing and one by one they entered the spiral their dancing crew increasingly raucous as they in tone we are a circle moving one with another we are moving together we are one in such a large and diverse cities as the New York Times it is no surprise that the craft is fairly accessible if you know where to look nearly 880 covens and Pagan organizations operate in the New York metropolitan area according to the pagan networking site The Witches voice which sounds quite awesome nationally about seven hundred and thirty-four thousand Americans identify as pagan or Wiccan according to a 2014 Pew Research survey which is fewer than the number of people who listen to this show daily so it's not exactly like a burgeoning mass movement all across the country apparently ten thousand witches live in practice in New York I don't know what it means to practice witchcraft I guess that you like to ride a broom in any case this sort of this sort of thing is not I think good for association with the me2 movement but radicalism always tends to draw a bunch of people who are the most enthusiastic and we're seeing it in our politics as well so we're seeing with the me2 movement as some of its leaders are some of the most morally questionable and radical people even though the metes movement has some underlying good points to make we're seeing it also with regard to our politics where the most radical people from both sides are tending to hijack movements that actually have some credibility to them so on the right you have people like Kelly Ward Kelly Ward is running in a primary in Arizona right now against martha mcsalley martha mcsalley is a much better candidate she's a representative from Arizona former Air Force colonel I believe who is a the first woman to fly in combat if I'm not mistaken her record is pretty sterling Martha Maxim mix Alice she's running against Kelly Ward who is kind of a nut case and Kelly Ward is running around touring with Mike Serna Mitch a guy whose most famous for promoting pizza gate she was on MSNBC and she's promoting her candidacy by saying that she doesn't know who Mike certain pitches audiences but she wants to appeal to them all so it's very easy for radicals to get a lot of attention and Kelly Ward is getting a lot of attention specifically because folks on the Left have an interest in elevating her and also because radicals again are some of the most outspoken and loud and entertaining people in America I mean Mike Serna vich has an audience that we want to reach and that includes Republicans conservatives liberals Democrats people of all ilk sand so if he's coming on the bus tour I think that he'll have a voice and he'll have something that he wants to say meanwhile on the Left what you're seeing is the complete seduction of the Democratic Party into hardcore actual socialism even though they won't actually define their terms there's an interesting column by Elizabeth brood ik who is the the in house socialists over at the Washington Post the irony of course is that I couldn't access this column without actually paying for the pay wall even though it's about the glories of socialism so that's too bad but we'll get to

promise so go check that out right now we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation so as I say every major movement in the United States right now is in danger of being taken over by radicals because radicals are the most motivated part of any base I've talked about the process of renormalization before on the show is a term that that was used by the the guy who wrote skin in the game Nassim Nicholas Taleb the basic idea is this big groups tend to surrender to small groups of very motivated people that's just the way life works if you are a family and one daughter is vegan very soon you will all be eating vegan because mom or dad does not want to bother with actually making two separate dinners for everybody one meat and one vegan instead everybody will just eat vegan and suddenly the whole family is vegan and then when that family goes to a party and the whole family is vegan the entire party becomes vegan because it's a lot easier and cheaper the transaction cost of having to cook two meals is higher than the transaction cost of just going along with the most radical people in any part of the base you want to satisfy the base because the base is the loudest and the most polarized so you see this with regard to the me2 movement where every accusation has to be taken with equal seriousness no matter how stupid no matter how unjust which is bad for the me2 movement because it undermines the credibility of the me2 movement you've seen it with regard to the right where a lot of folks who should not be given credibility have been given credibility because they are the most motivated and you're now seeing it on the part of the left where democratic socialists are taking over the mainstream Democratic Party because the Democratic Party wants to cater to its most motivated base the people who go out and knock on doors so Elizabeth brooding who is the in-house socialist over at the Washington Post her husband Matt burnings at both nice people I've talked to at least Matt and he seems like a nice guy both of them are socialists NAT runs something called the Public Policy Institute which is which is a 501c3 pushing socialism but not really socialism kind of pushing Nordic socialism which is not quite the same thing Elizabeth brooding has a column today about why it's time to reclaim socialism from the dirty word category the problem for her is that she actually doesn't want to define what socialism is because socialism is inherently radical you can find socialism however you want some people define socialism as stuff I like from the Nordic countries and some people define it as getting rid of the profit motive which is how the democratic socialists of America do the goal of socialists is to pretend they are not what they are which is radical so here's Elizabeth burnings column you'll see how she's sort of obfuscating the terminology she's using in order to cover for her own radical agenda so here's what she says a Gallup poll this month found the Democrats are warming up to the idea of socialism or at least to the word well 57% of Democrats polled said they view socialism positively only 47% said the same of capitalism down from 56% in 2016 Republicans meanwhile remain pretty enthusiastic about capitalism with 71% rating it positively still 16% of GOP voters said they even view socialism through a friendly lens which raises the question when Americans say they've used socialism one way or the other what exactly do they have in mind the United States doesn't have a familiar established socialist history to look to for guidance on what socialism might mean in this country that's not actually true there was a Socialist Workers movement led by Eugene Debs in the early 20th century that actually became relatively popular and that's because it was full scale nationalization of industry socialism generally means that the government runs the economy it is centralized planning it is central planning from the top of the economy including up to an including full scale nationalization of resources without regard to profit motive that would be sort of the usual mechanism by which socialism runs what the left has tended to do is redefine socialism as capitalism with some socialist redistribution as policies on top so what's weird about that is John take for example John rockefeller so the Rockefeller family earned an enormous enormous amount of money in capitalism then they gave an enormous amounts of money to charity with a capitalists or socialists I would say they were capitalists who gave to charity perhaps if you're going to say that charitable giving forced by the government and socialism what you would say is that the Rockefellers were actually socialists because they used capitalism in order to create this enormous amount of wealth and they redistributed the wealth what that really is is the growth engine is capitalism and the redistributed mechanism is socialism and this is why breaking down each particular policy is sort of important so we can determine whether a policy is good but calling the entire country socialist or capitalist unless you're talking about Cuba which is entirely socialist makes very little sense but that's not where brooding goes what she does instead is she refuses to define the term she says the United States doesn't have a familiar established socialist history to look to for guidance on what socialism might mean in this country but that doesn't mean socialism is hopelessly nebulous or that Americans who are interested in the idea are wandering a blurs it just means that socialism like any sophisticated term warrants thoughtful consideration socialism has meant different things to different people in different times in places while maintaining a stable core of themes and objectives social as opposed to private control of the means of production okay now she's talking about nationalization you would think and of all the societal humanitarian and political economic changes that entails especially their freedom and autonomy of working people are concerned again this is extraordinarily vague because if you say does that mean nationalization she'll say well maybe and then if you said well does that mean that workers are supposed to take over the factory should say well maybe but it's not specific enough for us to actually dig down so what she's doing is smart because she's attempting to guys her radicalism in this sort of vague incrementalism she does the term itself socialism came into being in the early decades of the 19th century and like any good word inspired a great deal of imagination for the non Marxian English socialists of the 1840s socialism mainly meant opposition to the competitive dehumanizing effect of liberal economies local experiments with communitarianism and cooperatives and demands for the privileges of freedom autonomy and participation and government to extend some lower classes none of which would actually define as socialism per se because if you and your family decide to get together and do a co-op that's not quite socialism if it's private if you just meanwhile Marxian socialism folks focused on the conditions of production who owns what the relationships between wage earners and owners and how stuff gets made in a society and the kind of politics these conditions produce even when socialism was a relatively new term in other words its exact meaning was disputed and what burning is basically going to do here is obscure that there is such a thing as socialism instead what she's going to do is just claim that all the stuff she likes to socialism and all the stuff she doesn't like is not socialism which is a smart way of sort of ushering socialism into the mainstream but it's also a dishonest way and to explain more in just one second so brunnen continues she talks about now as in the 19th century confusion about what socialism means is stoked by political interest in clouding the issue as eric Levitz notes in new york magazine conservatives tend to oscillate between arguing that successful countries such as Finland Norway and Denmark generally regarded as socialist are actually as capitalist as the United States and claiming as fox business networks trish regan recently did that socialism has made these countries stagnant insult to fiying well no both are actually true both all of those Scandinavian countries are based on a foundation of capitalism there is no question than what earns the profits in Finland Norway and Denmark is not their socialist means of production it is profit-seeking incentives that is what it's created all growth curve in Scandinavian countries for as long as human history because socialism has never created serious growth in any country state-sponsored capitalism is merely the state using capitalistic profit seeking methods in order to subsidize particular industries which creates growth in those industries but sucks growth out of other industries but socialism is the idea that the profit motive doesn't matter and we ought to redistribute all resources again obscuring the terminology is an easy way of preventing people from understanding what socialism means I like that Elizabeth running concludes this way clarifying exactly what socialism means once and for all likely won't happen anytime soon but that doesn't mean voters who are attracted to democratic socialist politicians such as senator Bernie Sanders and House candidate Alexandra Ocasio Cortez don't know what they're getting into proposals to wipe out the so-called right to work laws to make college tuition free or to provide universal health care are resonating with those supporters at the heart of the democratic socialist vision finally should gets to her definition after all of that here is her definition of socialism at the heart of the democratic socialist vision flowering on the American Left is the recognition that more than policy tweaks will be needed to empower everyday people to participate meaningfully in society and democracy this is where she strips finally away and what we are left with is radicalism the radicalism at the heart of this program taking over the Democratic Party now you have to hide it but this is really what's going on she's working Americans deserve a say and how the country's vast wealth will be used it's not the country's vast wealth it is wealth earned by individuals who are working hard and playing by the rules and employing other individuals like treating all wealth as a collective is the way that you actually get to gulags the direct line between the country owns all the wealth and the gulags is actually relatively short because working Americans deserve a say and how the country's vast wealth will be used and that will be possible only when inequality is reduced corporate and big-money donors are banished from politics and lawmakers are truly accountable to the people it's not so much to ask but democratic socialists are the only one asking which of course is not true when you talk about corporate and big-money donors being banished from politics I assume she's not talking about the Washington Post which is a giant corporation involved in politics all the time I assume she's not talking about her husband's public policy institute which is deeply involved in taking large donations I assume from donors who then wish to promulgate a political agenda and she says lawmakers being fruit ly accountable to the people it seems to me that the Tea Party was acting for exactly the same thing so the Socialists played this double game just like radicals often do of pretending that they are not radical but then at the end stripping away all of this in favor of their radicalism this is why it's important to identify I think that there is a common sensor to the country still there's still a group of people in the country who wish to have intelligent conversation about actual terminology but that can only happen when we get down to the actual root of the issues so if we want to have a discussion about me too then it can't all be about Harvey Weinstein and Asia Argento instead it's got to be about what social standards we wish to purvey when it comes to sex and sexuality we can have an honest conversation about what conservatives and looks like but that cannot be a conversation about whether Mike Serna vich and his crowd are worth catering to hey we can have an honest conversation even about the the lengths to which we should redistribute resources in the United States I think very little there are a lot of people think a lot more but we can't do that so long as people are getting and hiding all this under the rubric of democratic socialism because what they mean is being deliberately obscured the radicals are taking over a lot of areas of American life because they are the loudest and because they shout the loudest and because they get the most media attention and because both sides have an interest in highlighting the most radical people on the other side in order to clarify the distinctions between the sides but the only way we're gonna have a common conversation as we get down to the roots of actual terminology and explain what we mean because then we can actually discuss what works and what doesn't but people have a real interest in being as radical as they want to be while guising it in the language of broader movements Asia Argento and company have an interest in taking a radical agenda and guising it as me too broadly witchcraft and me too it's all the same thing that's foolish okay conflation of good ideas of bad ideas or conflating ideas we can all agree about with radical ideas is the way that politics ends up becoming polarized and radicalize and then we have no common sense or for us to have a conversation anymore okay time for some things I like and then we'll get to some things that I hate so things I like I'm recommending this book a little bit early it's a book by Oren Kass and I think I'm out I believe til November but you can pre-order it right now it's called the once in future worker now Oren Kass and I disagree on elements regarding free trade for example he's a lot more trade restriction astern certain ways he's still in favor of trade but he's more trade restriction estanque he might argue he's more free trade than I think he is he is a a really good thinker over at the Manhattan Institute who talks about why it is that certain jobs in the United States and the manufacturing base particularly have been hollowed out his suggestion is that it has something to do with technology but it has more to do with the fact that we have made our business environment uncompetitive through environmental regulation in certain areas and through union contracts as governed by the National Labor Relations Act he makes a case for actual adoption of certain European styles with regards to for example unions and education and this is the part that's really fascinating there are good conversations to be had about why there is less income inequality in certain areas of Europe or why education is better in Sweden than it is in the United States no one wants to have those actual conversations instead we all want to do bumper-sticker stuff about why Sweden is spending so much of its GDP on government redistribution ISM why not instead look at what they're actually doing with regard to education so in Sweden everybody is tracked so for example in the United States there are no tracks right we all go to the same classes and then we get to decide whether to go to college and everybody has the opportunity to go to college in Sweden in Israel in a lot of other countries what they do is by the time you are in eighth grade you're basically deciding is this a person who's ready for college or as a person not ready to go to college if they're not ready for college we get them an apprenticeship program or they actually are learning practical skills for a job they're going to do now you can move between tracks you're not stuck there forever it's not like we just trap you in there but you actually have to achieve to move from one track to another and you also have to seriously think about whether everybody is fit for college in the United States the model seems to be if you don't go to NYU for any reason then you are going to be poor and that's foolish that's foolish you'd be better off if a lot of the folks who are not going to college the college attendance rates by the way have been pretty stable in the United States for a fair bit of time and that's because there are a lot of people who just aren't ready for college and instead it ought to be prepped for a job Orrin Kass talks about a lot of these sort of policy solutions that nobody wants to talk about the book is well worth reading it's the once in future worker go check it out right now it's a sophisticated take on a lot of deep policy issues and and worth checking out ok time for a couple of things that I hate as I mentioned earlier ELISA there there are a lot of people on the Left who are deep believers that character is that a finding issue in politics except when it comes to people on their own side and this means that they are going to be as radical as they want to be so Alyssa Milano tweeted this out over the weekend she tweeted out a picture of herself in what looks like a Little Red Riding Hood costume it's like she didn't even she could even afford to go get the full Handmaid's Tale costume so she went out and she got like a little Red Riding Hood costume and she put it on and then she tweeted out holding a sign that says never Kavanagh never Gilead because justice Cavanaugh justice Cavanaugh and the Supreme Court would apparently usher in the era in which women were just essentially birth mothers who were raped at will because that's what justice Cavanaugh was all about I mean if you hadn't noticed that's clearly is his deal and she tweeted out hashtag rise up for ro hashtag we are not property hashtag stop Cavanaugh the the character assassination is is pretty astonishing and somewhat hilarious but demonstrative of of how people on the Left really want to see their political opponents people on the right do the same thing with regard to their political opponents who everybody is a demon everybody's a devil but I think right now the level of demonization on the left of the right is a lot higher than the demonization of the right by the of the right to the left so anyway she's not the only one Bill Maher over the weekend he says that President trumpets he's obviously a Russian asset it's not the president Trump is a doofus it's not the president Trump yeah I mean I asked Bill Maher this on his program is Trump a doofus or is he an evil genius and Mars answer was he's Hitler which was a weird answer but Bill Maher is now saying it is obvious that President Trump is a Russian asset this sort of character assassination is dishonest it's somewhat effective in in making the radical base more pumped up if they're out if pumping up the radical bases all politics is going to become all common conversation goes away here's more pumping up the radical base I'm sorry but it's super obvious already he is a Russian asset this has been going on since the 80s they were targeting for this and Bob Miller's report is just gonna be what this movie and this book is yes will you hope so with even more is it's going to be foolproof okay so that that's the great hope is that Trump will be ousted by the moto report and the left sees or sweeping in and none of this is good for American politics this is why the president would be well-served to sort of go silence on Muller stuff until what happens actually happens but that's not the way our politics is moving this is this is the deeply disturbing part about our politics the radicals are getting louder the people who want to have honest conversations and actually drill down into the terminology are being obscured by folks who don't want to have conversation they just want to rile up their own base because every election is now about base politics the media are taking a part in this the worst story of the weekend from the media was this the media freaked out over a guy named Joel aronia Lara 36 who was detained at a gas station in San Bernardino where he and his wife were on their way to the hospital for her c-section he reportedly had been living in the United States illegally for 12 years and the entire meeting went nuts how dare this happened Kyle Griffin who's a reporter I believe over at NBC he said ice detained a man while he was driving his pregnant wife to the hospital he was taken when they stopped for gas and they quoted his wife saying my husband needs to be here he had to wait for his son for so long and someone just took him away Daniel Dale who is a writer for I believe some the Toronto Star he says the same thing right oh it's so awful how dare I state Amy's people representative Joe Kennedy said there's heartless and then there's whatever the hell this is I mean the Kennedy family should know about heartless leaving a woman to die in an air bubble at the top of a car is not exactly showing a lot of heart but the entire media go nuts over all of this there's only one problem with this story it turns out the guy who was arrested was arrested because he's suspected of murder hey there's an outstanding warrant for his arrest in Mexico on homicide charges so this isn't they just decided to pick up a guy who's an illegal immigrant at a gas station while he's driving his wife to the hospital for a c-section the guy is legitimately a a suspected homicide perpetrator so well done media again driving politics to the to its its best I think possible course okay time for a Federalist Papers so getting back to the foundations of the country and the philosophy that has supported it we go through a federalist paper every week this week's Federalist paper is Federalist 42 this is the second most cited Federalist paper in all of courts jurisprudence I believe after Federalist 78 which we'll eventually get to James Madison wrote this one he talks about the powers of the federal government including the power to control foreign policy and treaties and why the federal government ought to have these power there's one particular section that is worth reading and that is the section in which James Madison talks about the Constitution and its designs toward slavery so one of the great lies that has been perpetrated by the political left in the United States for a long time is that the Constitution was designed to enshrine slavery the Constitution was designed to gradually kill slavery here is James Madison describing it isn't just me saying this this is James Madison writing at the time it were doubtless to be wished that the power of prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until the Year 1808 or rather that had been suffered to have immediate operation and he's saying I would rather if we just gotten rid of the importation of slaves like now but it is not difficult to account either for this restriction on the general government or for the manner in which the whole clause is expressed it ought to be considered as a great point gained in favor of humanity that a period of 20 years may terminate forever within these states a traffic which is so long and so loudly uprated the barbarism of modern policy that within that period and will receive a considerable discouragement from the federal government and may be totally abolished by a concurrence of the few states which constitute the unnatural traffic in the prohibitory example which has been given by so great majority of the Union happy would it be for the unfortunate Africans if an equal prospect lay before them of being redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren the idea that Madison is espousing Harris he thought and a lot of the founders did that slavery would go away a lot earlier than it actually ended up going away instead the South clung to slavery for decades longer than then you know was not only morally decent but even politically necessary and that led to the Civil War but if the idea was that the Constitution of the United States was intended to protect slavery that is simply not true it is simply not true it was a compromised position adopted in order to pass the Constitution but the reason we got to that compromise is because most people in the United States because the nor that was more heavily populated most of the people in the United States were already in favor of getting rid of slavery as early as the adoption of the Constitution in all likelihood and that was certainly true in places like New York which is where the Federalist Papers were originally published the paper also discusses the uniform power of preventing internal tariffs the power to control citizenship talks about why the government the federal government has to have the power over all of these but that section about slavery is telling and is a good rejoinder to all these folks who say that the founding fathers were simply attempting to enshrine slavery because they loved it so much which is not true James Madison by the way was a southerner right his Virginia all right so we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is produced by Senya Villarreal executive producer Jeremy boring senior
