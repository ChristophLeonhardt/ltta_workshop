Oh a comb-over yeah ritmo oh my gosh that's Tito Puente after he said too many mojitos I'm Max Keiser this is the Kaiser report in Twitter Rico a territory that's currently under occupation by the kunta and unbelievably we're standing in front of some art that is representationally depicting the hunt uh what the heck is going on Stacie this is La Puerta de la bandera which means the the flag door on July 1st 2016 it was painted black prior to that it was the classic Puerto Rican flag blue at top red stripes down now it's black because from then what some dub la junta began to occupy this territory I was gonna say nation but of course it's not totally a nation it's a territory of the United States so on July 1st 2016 they defaulted on a two billion dollar payment on a general obligation bond the first time since 1933 that had happened in the United States or any US territory right so really set in motion a new period in Puerto Rican history so roughly at about the same time you had a whole new group of entrepreneurs in the crypto space decide that well Puerto Rico could be a great place for us to come and decamp and set up shop and turn this into a crypto paradise and we're gonna be looking at some of those stories while we're here in Puerto Rico and of course we'll be sampling some awesome mofongo and we're gonna get into the culture we're gonna do so I'm going to learn how to do some serious salsa dancing by the end of this show something I've been meaning to do for the past 30 years and do the horizontal mambo maybe a couple of times who knows yeah what that what's going on there well let me just give credit to the artist ro Santa Alvarez she made this in 2012 and then painted it black in 2016 when the Obama administration brought in promesa which means promise in Spanish but in English it stands for Puerto Rico oversights management and economic stability Act and thus on you mentioned Tito Puente who of course was a Puerto Rican American his parents were from Puerto Rico he that sewing song yo komova me ritmo so listen to my rhythm is what that means and so we're gonna listen to the rhythm of this island you and i have been to many places in a similar situation whether it's greece whether it's ireland we've seen economic collapse and troika's and outside bodies oversight and fiscal stability boards coming in fiscal control boards in this situation coming in and occupying economically at least and that's really all that matters yeah financial repression you know whether it's in the u.s. when they artificially drop interest rates down to below market rates or whether you're in Greece where you have the troika as it's known and now here we are Porto Rico with the Hunta as it's being called around the world there's always a battle going on with the central bankers and the commercial bankers always trying to repress the population in one way or another we call the global insurrection against banker occupation we've been saying this for years on this show so now we're going to look at it from the Puerto Rican perspective they are similarly being repressed by the overlords of Finance and they are reacting in a very specific for to Rican way a lot of salsa a lot of beans and rice a lot of dancing a lot of sunshine and a lot of crypto baby by the way they are American that's one thing to remember that I feel so proud to be American this is a great location San Juan is gorgeous it's a colonial city it's hundreds of years old France who was that guy Ponce de Leon yes well he first of course basically found his old San Juan he was the first governor here and we're gonna be here for the next few episodes we're gonna be reporting on the financial situation here remember on June 30th 2016 when Obama first introduced this new legislation promesa appointing a fiscal Control Board over the island they are not allowed basically they don't have their own economic sovereignty here because the the President of the United States appoints these people to the control board the fiscal control board when they went bankrupt at that I'm their debt was seventy billion dollars that's about $20,000 per person on the island since then of course because of the hurricane and because of the economic collapse hundreds of thousands hundreds of thousands have actually left so now there's only about 3.3 million people on the island this is the Bay of San Juan where all of the Colonials all the colonial powers whether the Dutch the Spanish or the British arrive through here this is the new world the gateway to the new world that's so gorgeous I reminds me of the South of France I we should move here that's it I've decided we got to move here now we're gonna join the crypto revolution in San Juan Puerto Rico I feel it blockchain in my veins I've got blockchain stigmata pouring out of my crypto consciousness right here as I fuse with cyber Christ on Sunday it is a Sunday and you know we've been walking around this island and that is a thing that is quite surprising to me I thought it was more like the Bahamas and a tourist destination and kind of a hellhole Miami like situation but in fact it's an amazingly beautiful 500 year old it feels like you're in Lisbon or villefranche-sur-mer it does feel like our remarkable European city we've been to a lot of beautiful places all over the world and this has got to be one of the most beautiful I got to tell you so I was talking about the fiscal Control Board and promesa and the fact that they lost her economic sovereignty it's a situation similar to what happened with Greece however you can tell the difference Max and I have been to Athens many times or San Juan no tear gas but also there's a it's let much less depressed here I think because the fiscal control board is filled with Americans who basically Donald Trump is now the the guy who would appoint this fiscal Control Board and he's gone back front more than anybody else let me give me a comparison here between Greece and Ireland you know the Greece was allowed they've made an example of and the economy went up in flames the tear gas was everywhere and their suffering and depression Ireland play ball with the IMF and the troika and they were you know got through the austerity measures and now there's a huge financial boom there except you have to pay a lot for basics like water to pay for it also the poor getting ripped off of course but here this is more like that Irish situation where they're kind of nursing them through fiscally until the crypto boom hits and it's gonna hit in the next 24 months I can feel it I can feel the blockchain it smells like victory well max you know that and 2016 when they defaulted on their two billion dollar bond payment the first time since 1933 that a state a US state or territory had done so defaulting on a general obligation bond which you're not supposed to be able to do well they did it they were seventy billion in debt then by 2017 they were a hundred and twenty three billion in debt and then nobody really talks about it anymore because you know I hurricane Maria hit and hurricane Maria was a category 4 hurricane you've already saw hurricane Maria Wow they've only Leonard Bernstein knew what was gonna come in 2018 for 2017 well you know old San Juan and San Juan don't have that much damage that we can see apparently the rest of the island does we will try to get out there but it did cause 90 according to this headline rebuilding Puerto Rico will cost 95 billion dollars mirror shells you can race that at an ICO in a heartbeat that's nothing this whole place is gonna go crypto Street I'm feeling it well just so you know max is talking about that because there are three simultaneous Bitcoin conferences happening on the island we will talk to some of those people we are over the next few days gonna go there and talk to those people there are many stories about the new colonialist some people say they're the new Colonials I did speak to a former government and yeah well he was Alberto somebody and he said that he welcomes them all he doesn't see them as colonial so we're gonna cover that over the next week when you say Oh they've got 95 billion in debt they want the fault thing on their dead there's more debt it's not like the the territory in occurred this debt willingly 40-week Oh has always been a debt toxic debt dump where Wall Street dumps debt you know and this is the story when you have an empire like the US and they picked on not only European countries and Latin American countries but they picked on for it oh Rico you know it's completely asymmetric warfare they've dumped debt here and people say well we'll take the money I mean why would you say no to money and then they come calling for the interest payments and like oh no we got a default then they say well we're gonna have to come in with austerity measures and take over all your basic services and privatize and then Maria hit and said that's right we're in hurricane alley deal with that Wall Street well so so max I mean the thing is that what let's talk about why they are so in debt because it is different between Ireland between Greece between here Ireland went bust because of those banks the golden circle of bankers who lent to each other money and it was all basically private debt owned by a bank without even any retail deposits and the European Union the ECB forced the Irish people to basically bail out this private bank in Greece yes they did borrow so much money and that was because of the ECB because of the eurozone and everybody lent money to them cheaper than it should have been you know what happened in Puerto Rico is that they had since 1917 in the Jones Act they had the Chipola exempt tax bonds so tell us about that because you sold those on Wall Street what happened there yeah that's nice ed it's it's a toxic debt dump because on Wall Street you can always sell a Puerto Rico triple tax-free BB rated bond to mr. mrs. Schwartz out in Long Island for that tax-free equivalent you know he said hey it's taxable equivalent of seven percent on your money dr. Schwartz dentist in Bay City and you know you just sell those all day long it's an easy trade to do and they just love this place up with debt out of convenience it's debt from convenience and now they don't pay the interest on the debt they shouldn't pay the interest on the debt they should force it back to Wall Street where it came from it said take your toxic debt sludge and cram it up your shrinks thing they're not going to pay the interest on this thing because you just manufactured it in your derivatives Factory has nothing to do with our economy go go eat a mofongo and and and drop dead well they did eat a lot of mofongo death they had ate a lot of debt and that part of that by the way happened Puerto Rico's recession remember everybody else in the world saw it hit in 2008 in 2009 it actually hit in 2006 here and what happened is that was the end of a 10-year period set in motion from Bill Clinton basically every single thing in the world that has gone wrong was because of Bill Clinton whether it was his Commodities Futures Modernization Act which allowed derivatives be traded not as bets but as actual investments whether he got rid of glass-steagall and then caused all the banks to turn into gambling zones as well but he also in 1996 he basically overturned some tax advantages to US corporations to manufacture here and most of them were in the south of the island we'll get into that how that actually impacts the electrical grid here but by 2006 all of the tax advantages to being here were lost and all of them like literally thousands of people lost their jobs overnight and thus set in motion the debt spiral well the does the death spiral is being reversed thanks to innovation entrepreneurialism brock pierce and the blockchain we're gonna have a reverse of the death spiral toward the death reinforcing stairway to heaven and at the top of the heaven is a man named Satoshi Nakamoto and we get there through the blockchain one block at a time every 10 minutes a new block is born like a star in the universe and the multiverse and it just says hello I'm here and I love you welcome back to the Kaiser report I'm Max Keiser time now to turn to John mud according to his Twitter bio he's an attorney a legal analyst a teller of stories a bread baker and statehood supporter John welcome thank you all right so John mud you are a statehood supporter what does that mean in the context of Puerto Rico well for time immemorial even during the Spanish times there was a certain conflict in politicians the few that were allowed to be politicians between being having automate autonomy being part of Spain or being independent now nowadays we have the same three things the problem is that under the territory of plus the United States Congress can discriminate against a church or whatever ways it wants to as long as it's not fundamental rights so therefore you are discriminated in terms of federal funding etc in Independence of course you have certain advantages and disadvantages and in statehood you have that advantage is answering disadvantages of course right so you're weighing up all those advantages and disadvantages and you're kind of falling in the camp of statehood yeah well just a little explore that a little bit more so what would that mean for people living here well first of all first thing that you would do is that I was born in Hawaii so I wasn't born in Puerto Rico my citizenship is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment for indeed answer is a big will the important case of 1901 the Puerto Rican citizenship which came in 1917 is not but as long as I live here Congress can say you can't have this you can't have that okay once we become a state you will have equal rights word but because your state can discriminate Tenth Amendment will create it second you would have an end to the endless debate about steps and that I'm sorry in this debate of status status and that is consumes enormous amounts of energy in Puerto Rico and and resources there's a group of elites in Puerto Rico who are opposing statehood simply because they don't want to pay federal taxes seventy percent of people in Puerto Rico because of their income or lack I would not pay federal taxes would even even have to file a federal income tax return but the big businesses the few that are Puerto Rico a local would have to okay so in the tax issue you're saying seventy percent of people wouldn't even qualify to be in a tax bracket so they wouldn't pay tax those who are against statehood as such are looking at it purely from that taxes that lands are mostly not nice most of these are people who say because we're different from the gringos we have a different culture etcetera I would say culture evolves it's not the same thing when I came to Puerto Rico in November of 1963 my first cultural shock was in during the Holy Week in 64 the whole programming changed I couldn't see my my my cartoons because there were religious groups and that doesn't happen anymore because culture changes that it's only in my lifetime if you look at 100 years of course there's greater changes for example in 1898 before the Americans came there was only Catholic Church was alone no Protestants were about you because there was the law in Spain that changed abortion gay rights etc have all been determined by American decisions so you're suggesting there's a bit of sentimentality here that there has been enormous change already and so let's talk about some specifics here so since July 1st of 2016 Prerna Rica was effectively run by a fiscal Control Board appointed by the US president under what's called promesa now does this body get to overrule the governor and other elected officials here and how does this even impact the notion of sovereignty when I first heard of this the first thing I thought about was Greece and the troika you know Greece was having a lot of trouble and the troika being ECB EU and another body ruled over Greece is this similar and what are your thoughts not the same the Greeks could have said no we don't want your money we could have gotten out of the union with enormous amounts of difficulty and problems but it could have done they had a referendum and voted out as a matter of fact I bet they still do politicians did something again and I understand that but in Puerto Rico it's a little bit different go back to dance where submit will dance where submit will says Congress can give the territories self-government or take it away and that's exactly what happened here the board when it was imposed took away some of the powers of the other government were Tory Co not all of them actually there's a decision by the BIA by a judge Swain as to the appointment of a CEO for Ripa and she said no you can't do that fold the board no you can't do that that may change when the fiscal plans are approved but that's another matter all right so just dig into that a little bit more because on the surface it looks like from Mesa and the US has absolute control and there's that's a naive you I think what you're saying that there's Morton there's more nuance to it yes because the problem is that nothing you which you can't say that it's Congress territorial Clause says Congress may dispose of and make needful rules for the characters it's not the president of course of course the president has to sign up on it but right now the board has certain duties and responsibilities and can override the Governor of Puerto Rican certain things but another to can't you'll have to read the opinion by the judge Swain I think it was in November as to mr.sarma to really understand it and maybe you will have a little bit difficulty but that's the way it is you mentioned prepa right so tell us prep it what it is prep what role have they played in bankrupting the territory okay um we got to go back yes let's go back to the 1930s people nowadays wouldn't understand it but in those days most people thought that capitalism was Anna's last straight we're talking about the depression and that planned economies Soviet Union style and Nazi Germany style what rule this was most of the intellectuals in the world thought that the popular Democratic Party was was inaugurated or made in 1938 in 1940 wins the elections in 1941 it takes all of the different electrical companies that were in Puerto Rico nationalizes them and creates pelipper the government is gonna take care of this problem is that once you have politicians in charge of something as your grid they make political decisions they don't make business decisions so they've slowly been bankrupting prepa and right now it was nine billion dollars right you know when I worked on Wall Street we sold Twitter we Co bonds all the time you get triple tax exempt yes it's like B+ or something like that waiting and it I was they have been encumbered with a lot of debt and I think a lot of that debt was just convenience of selling debt inventory on Wall Street debt that was not needed they just became over encumbered with a lot of debt this is a question I've had for a while okay yeah what do you think about that you have to this is similar but you're saying it's like you you've been offered the money so you say okay I'll take it right you have to look at it from another point of view when I was growing up in Puerto Rico s everywhere in the United States I was offered drugs by people and I said no some of the people I knew said yes and now they're in street lights in Puerto Rico asking for money it's similar here you can you you may say that Wall Street was trying to get where we go to issue bonds but what it was dying to do that so they could have money to politicians and do whatever they wanted if you look in 2001 the public debt reporter because it was 27 billion dollars okay now you've got a new predator on the scene yeah the way you characterize Wall Street was a bit of a predatory relationship there now you've got hedge funds coming in and they are seemingly strong-arming the government into paying back loans that maybe should not be paid back etc john paulson for example is a big player and all this as i understand it well I see you shaking he was he got rid of his bonds what he did what Paulson did I'm very smart Marley came in he saw like this hotel has a lot of potential has a lot of debt let me by typical capitalism buy cheap and then you sell dear yeah hedge funds once local insurance okay if you buy a 10 cents of the on the dollar and I offer you 50 cents on a dollar you're making 40 cents online sounds good hedge funds usually not always because you had a look at our deena right Argentina being an example of maybe a hedge funds acting in a more predatory fashion but also a payment in this case you get hedge funds to make deals for example but if I what if I had a deal prep I had a fifteen twenty percent at the end it was a twenty percent haircut on its debt the board said no to it for two three but but that's what happened and the government was all in favor of it but the board said no so he couldn't couldn't go through so would it be fair to say your view would be look hedge funds in themselves are not the problem they're just pure capitalist entities the management of those hedge funds could be a problem in that they're not being directed in a way that would be beneficial okay you have to understand one thing I hide fund any fun any business is run or your stockholders for the benefit of your stockholders it's not for the benefit of people Puerto Rico okay that's supposed to be the government the same government that took all these loans to keep funding their never-ending appetite for giving things to people so they would vote for them but it hasn't worked for the last four or five elections but that's the way it goes right okay well I mean there could be an argument that the on the fun side there there is a bit of duplicitous there but but let's let's move on to let me put it this way yeah their purpose is to make a buck this purpose is not a public purpose right that's what there's purpose is to make a buck but the idea of an Oracle capitalism let's say government run by anarcho-capitalist is not a favorable outcome either whoops who's the narc narco capitalist here well you're saying that the market would have the ultimate discretion in determining what's best for the island no no no no I'm not talking about the market politicians are supposed to do that but they're not because they're deferring to the hedge funds no they're deferring because what they're doing is you're the politician you're politician a you make the decision to take out 3.5 billion dollar loan like the previous government did right are you gonna pay it no the taxpayers of what are you gonna pay it it's not you so you get the benefit because I spend the money and people owe me favors right but what we've seen in the past are some of the politicians being funded by in fact the same finance ears who would ultimately benefit by a arrangement that is not necessarily great for folks but I just want to ask you about the hurricane that's coming along or you know Maria 200,000 I've left the island since Hurricane Maria the storm has caused tens of billions and damages and so what's happening to the economy from that point of view with a big population dream so where were we at now obviously there's been enormous amounts of damage at the same time there is some money coming from FEMA a couple of billion at least has come in already and being spent there's gonna be more money from insurance there's gonna be more money from the federal government interestingly enough the economy has just shrunk by by five percent and the income the government gets from the economy it's shrunk only by five percent which is really good considering the enormous amount of damage the the hurricane cost for example I live in the border of two towns San Juan and Y now which are fairly good well well-run places and I was 82 days without electricity so there was a lot of damage but any of you consider that there's only a 5% decrease that's pretty good I think there the economy will real rebound because of what I told you after Hurricane Hugo 500 years of resilience persistence and that water Rican spirit John I gotta go okay thanks for being on the show all right well that's gonna do it for this edition of the Kaiser report with me Max Keiser ins Stacy Herbert like to thank our guest John Mudd if you want to reach us on Twitter it's Kaiser report until next time bye
