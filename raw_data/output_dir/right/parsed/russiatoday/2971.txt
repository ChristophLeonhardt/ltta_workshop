I just want to make one point very
fervently I'm a russophile and a
committed russophile and I know I took
the trouble before becoming Foreign
Secretary to station my ancestors around
the world and I have them in Germany in
France all over the place America and of
course here in in Moscow as well I
believe I'm certain that I'm the first
foreign secretary in the history of my
office to be called Boris probably quite
likely to be the last for some time I
would think
