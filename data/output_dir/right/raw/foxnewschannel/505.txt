1
00:00:01,163 --> 00:00:01,497
CONWAY.

2
00:00:01,497 --> 00:00:02,798
ARI, I WISH I COULD GET THE

3
00:00:02,798 --> 00:00:05,034
WHOLE PANEL GOING.

4
00:00:05,034 --> 00:00:05,534
THANK YOU, ALL.

5
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:06,201
PRESIDENT TRUMP APPARENTLY

6
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,403
BUOYED BY CAVANAGH'S PERFORMANCE

7
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,638
TODAY TWEETED SHORTLY AFTER IT

8
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:11,240
ENDED, JUDGE KAVANAUGH SHOWED

9
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,975
AMERICA EXACTLY WHY I

10
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:13,809
NOMINATED HIM.

11
00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:15,411
HIS TESTIMONY WAS POWERFUL,

12
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:16,412
HONEST, AND RIVETING.

13
00:00:16,412 --> 00:00:17,513
DEMOCRATS SEARCH AND DESTROY

14
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:19,114
STRATEGY IS DISGRACEFUL, AND

15
00:00:19,114 --> 00:00:20,316
THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN A TOTAL

16
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:22,284
SHAM AND AN EFFORT TO DELAY,

17
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:23,018
OBSTRUCT, AND RECESSED BY THE

18
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:23,786
SENATE MUST VOTE."

19
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:26,589
JOINING US NOW FROM THE

20
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,024
WHITE HOUSE, FROM THE

21
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:28,190
CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDN

WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT, KELLYANNE

23
00:00:29,825 --> 00:00:30,826
CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESID.

24
00:00:30,826 --> 00:00:32,360
WHAT IS THE MOOD TONIGHT?

25
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,128
AND THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY

26
00:00:33,128 --> 00:00:35,898
PLEASED WITH BRETT KAVANAUGH'S

27
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:38,400
APPEARANCE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.

28
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,002
BUT WHAT IS NEXT, WHAT WILL BE

29
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,270
THE NEXT MOVE BEFORE THE

30
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:42,071
WHITE HOUSE, GIVEN THE FACT THAT

31
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:43,272
WE STILL DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE

32
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,506
THE VOTES FROM THE REPUBLICANS

33
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:46,275
ON THE HILL?

34
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:48,010
>> LAURA, THANKS FOR HAVING ME

35
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,178
PRAYED WITH THE PRESIDENT SAW IN

36
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:49,879
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHEN HE FIRST

37
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,282
MET WITH HIM, AND CONSIDER

38
00:00:53,282 --> 00:00:54,016
DOMINATING THEM TO THE

39
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,750
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IS

40
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,120
WHAT THE WHOLE COUNTRY SAW TODA

41
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,420
TODAY.

42
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,821
A MAN OF GREAT SELF POSSESSION

43
00:00:58,821 --> 00:01:00,356
AND COMPOSURE WHO ALSO WAS ABLE

44
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:03,593
TO SHOW EMOTION AND EMPATHY FOR

45
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:05,027
THOSE HE FEELS ARE BEING

46
00:01:05,027 --> 00:01:05,828
WRONGED, CERTAINLY HIMSELF BUT

47
00:01:05,828 --> 00:01:08,431
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE PROCESS.

48
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,398
HIS YOUNG DAUGHTERS, HIS WIFE,

49
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:09,799
HIS PARENTS.

50
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,969
ALL OF THE WOMEN WHO HAVE COME

51
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:14,403
FORWARD TO SUPPORT HIM.

52
00:01:14,403 --> 00:01:15,238
HIS HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS WHO ARE

53
00:01:15,238 --> 00:01:16,639
NOW BEING DRAGGED INTO THIS,

54
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:19,208
EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE SAID THAT

55
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,610
THEY CANNOT CORROBORATE THESE

56
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,010
ALLEGATIONS.

57
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,211
>> Laura: KELLYANNE, THERE'S A

58
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:23,312
LOT OF COMMENTATORS ON TV WHO

59
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:27,517
ARE LIKE, BRETT SHOWED HE HE HAD

60
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:28,050
THIS SEETHING RAGE.

61
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,852
I HEARD ONE PERSON SAY, OH, IF

62
00:01:29,852 --> 00:01:31,220
HE COULD BE SO TICKED OFF AT

63
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,655
THIS, IMAGINE WHAT HE DOES WHEN

64
00:01:32,655 --> 00:01:34,457
HE HAS A FEW DRINKS IN HIM.

65
00:01:34,457 --> 00:01:37,961
I ACTUALLY HEARD SOMEONE SAY

66
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:40,663
THAT.

67
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:41,431
>> LAURA, RESPECTFULLY, YOU GOT

68
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:42,999
TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL OR PUT ON

69
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:43,800
THE RADIO ONCE A WHILE.

70
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,169
I DIDN'T SEE ANY OF THAT BECAUSE

71
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:47,770
IT'S NOT RELEVANT.

72
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,238
I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY

73
00:01:49,238 --> 00:01:54,377
SPENT TWO WEEKS, TWO PLUS WEEKS,

74
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:50,840
TRASH AND WHERE HE WAS 90 ABLE T

75
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,878
WATCHING AND LISTENING TO PEOPLE

76
00:01:55,878 --> 00:01:57,780
TRASH AND WHERE HE WAS 90 ABLE O

77
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,449
RESPOND.

78
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:02,018
THE SANCTIMONIOUS PENDANTS

79
00:02:02,018 --> 00:02:02,819
PONTIFICATING AND PREVARICATING

80
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:03,553
ABOUT A MAN THEY HARDLY KNOW.

81
00:02:03,553 --> 00:02:06,623
ALL THEY KNOW ABOUT HIM IS THAT

82
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:08,991
HE HAS 300 OPINIONS AND A

83
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:10,526
YEARBOOK PAGE.

84
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,095
AND THE SENATE DEMOCRATS TODAY

85
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:12,729
IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

86
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:13,329
ACTUALLY WERE FAR MORE

87
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,465
INTERESTED IN A YEARBOOK PAGE BY

88
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:19,402
A 17-YEAR-OLD BOY THEN 300

89
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:20,637
OPINIONS HE HAS AUTHORED AS A

90
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:21,204
MAN.

91
00:02:21,204 --> 00:02:22,405
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT

92
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:23,406
OUR PROCESS.

93
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:25,775
I THOUGHT TODAY WAS A

94
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:26,342
TOUR DE FORCE BY JUDGE

95
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:26,709
KAVANAUGH.

96
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,445
HE PUT IT ALL ON HIS SHOULDERS.

97
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:29,813
HE IS GOING TO RUN THROUGH THE

98
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:32,415
TAPE AND LABORED OUT IN THE

99
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:33,216
FIELD AND PIER TRUMP

100
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:34,017
FASHION.

101
00:02:34,017 --> 00:02:34,818
I THOUGHT JUDGE KAVANAUGH

102
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:35,786
CHANNELED HIS INNER

103
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,487
CLARENCE THOMAS AND HIS INNER

104
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:38,422
DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE IS NOT

105
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:39,456
GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO BESMIRCH

106
00:02:39,456 --> 00:02:43,694
A GOOD MAN'S REPUTATION AND

107
00:02:43,694 --> 00:02:44,294
--DASH GO AHEAD.

108
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,430
>> Laura: KELLYANNE, DO YOU

109
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,497
THINK THAT THE DECISION TO BRING

110
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,232
IN MS. MITCHELL, THE FORMER

111
00:02:49,232 --> 00:02:52,736
SEX CRIMES PROSECUTOR -- WAS

112
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:53,203
THAT EFFECTIVE?

113
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,805
I DON'T YOU WORK FOR THE

114
00:02:54,805 --> 00:02:56,440
WHITE HOUSE AND EVERYBODY SAYS

115
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,873
IT WAS GREAT.

116
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:58,241
I GOT TO SAY, I DIDN'T THINK IT

117
00:02:58,241 --> 00:02:58,809
WAS GREAT.

118
00:02:58,809 --> 00:03:00,277
I DIDN'T THINK THAT MITCHELL --

119
00:03:00,277 --> 00:03:01,812
SHE SEEMS LIKE A REALLY SMART

120
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:02,846
PERSON, A REALLY NICE PERSON, I

121
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,548
DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THE FORMAT

122
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:06,850
BUT IT ALL SEEMED A LITTLE TOO

123
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,952
PLOTTING IN A LITTLE TO LIKE IT

124
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:10,987
INSTEAD OF, THIS IS A

125
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:12,622
PERFORMANCE.

126
00:03:12,622 --> 00:03:14,024
I DON'T KNOW.

127
00:03:14,024 --> 00:03:15,392
I JUST TALKED LINDSEY GRAHAM AT

128
00:03:15,392 --> 00:03:17,260
THE REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY DID A

129
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,162
BETTER JOB THAN MITCHELL WITH

130
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:21,498
THE WITNESS, WITH THE ACCUSER.

131
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:23,033
>> I THINK WHAT PEOPLE

132
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:23,834
ULTIMATELY REMOVE HER FROM IS

133
00:03:23,834 --> 00:03:26,803
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

134
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,639
LET'S NOT FORGET WHAT TODAY IS

135
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:29,740
AND WHAT IT IS NOT AFRAID IT'S A

136
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,909
CIVIL PROCEEDING OR A ME TOO

137
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:33,377
MOVEMENT.

138
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:36,013
IT'S NOT A TRIAL BY TB.

139
00:03:36,013 --> 00:03:38,548
IT IS ANOTHER STEP IN THE SENATE

140
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:39,583
CONFIRMATION PROCESS FOR JUDGE

141
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,617
KAVANAUGH TO GO TO THE

142
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:41,184
SUPREME COURT.

143
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,553
WE SHOULD NOT LOSE SIGHT OF

144
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:42,853
THAT.

145
00:03:42,853 --> 00:03:46,023
I THINK THEY'LL REMEMBER HIM

146
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:46,757
THEY'LL REMEMBER HIM BECAUSE HE

147
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:48,959
BATTED ON THE ALLEGATIONS,

148
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:49,960
SHOWED, I WOULD SAY, EMOTION BUT

149
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,564
ALSO EMPATHY.

150
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:54,298
PEOPLE COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER

151
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,633
THEY WERE MAD AT HIM FOR

152
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,035
SHOWING -- CHANNELING THE ANGER

153
00:03:58,035 --> 00:04:00,170
THAT HE HAS FOR SENATE DEMOCRATS

154
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,206
AS HE SAID CALL HIM EVIL, AND

155
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:03,574
QUESTION HIS JUDGMENT, AND SAID

156
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:06,076
NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING

157
00:04:06,076 --> 00:04:07,811
WHILE THEY ARE HEARING

158
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:10,114
THREATENED HIS WIFE --

159
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:11,315
>> Laura: DID YOU THINK SHE

160
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:13,817
WAS EMPATHETIC, DR. FORD, THE

161
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:14,151
ACCUSER?

162
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:16,620
DID SHE SEEM CREDIBLE?

163
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,822
>> YES, I DO THINK -- NOT AS A

164
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:20,591
WOMAN.

165
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,658
I DON'T LIKE THAT.

166
00:04:21,658 --> 00:04:23,560
I SHOULD SAY THAT SHE CAME

167
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,662
ACROSS AS COMPELLING AS

168
00:04:25,662 --> 00:04:27,598
EMPATHETIC.

169
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:28,999
AND I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR TWO

170
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,367
WEEKS NOW, A WEEK NOW, THAT IT'S

171
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:31,435
TRUE THAT SOMETHING MAY HAVE

172
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:32,736
HAPPENED TO HER, SOMETHING

173
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:33,837
TERRIBLE MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO

174
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:34,204
HER.

175
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,839
ADJUSTED AND INVOLVE HIM.

176
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,808
HE SAID TODAY UNDER OATH, HE

177
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:39,610
DOESN'T DOUBT THAT SHE WAS

178
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,178
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR HARMED BY

179
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:43,180
SOMEONE, SOMEHOW, SOMEWHERE, BUT

180
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,815
THAT HE HAS HAD MANY TIMES NOW

181
00:04:44,815 --> 00:04:47,184
UNDER OATH, IT WASN'T HIM.

182
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:47,918
I THOUGHT WHAT JUDGE KAVANAUGH

183
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:49,620
DID TODAY IS AN EXERCISE IN THE

184
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,988
WAY PEOPLE SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE

185
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:51,522
WHO MISTREAT THEM.

186
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:52,089
I WILL TELL YOU WHY.

187
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:53,958
HE DID NOT DRAW FIRST BLOOD.

188
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:58,896
WHEN HE FIRST GAVE THE 34 HOURS

189
00:04:58,896 --> 00:05:01,365
OF SWORN TESTIMONY, HE SHOWED

190
00:05:01,365 --> 00:05:02,700
RESPECT, THE DEMOCRATS ANSWERED

191
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,567
WITH RUMINATION.

192
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:04,235
HE DEFERENCE.

193
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,771
THEY ANSWERED WITH CONSTRUCTION.

194
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:08,372
HE HAS WATCHED THEM TRYING TO

195
00:05:08,372 --> 00:05:10,007
DESTROY THEM AND HIS NAME I DO

196
00:05:10,007 --> 00:05:10,374
KNOW WHAT?

197
00:05:10,374 --> 00:05:11,008
HE RESPONDED IN KIND.

198
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:12,209
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE READY

199
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:12,610
FOR THAT.

200
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,211
THE DEMOCRATS QUESTIONS WERE

201
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:14,578
TERRIBLE.

202
00:05:14,578 --> 00:05:15,613
THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED

203
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:16,814
MS. MITCHELL TO STAY FOR A

204
00:05:16,814 --> 00:05:17,848
COUPLE MORE HOURS.

205
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:18,749
THEIR QUESTIONS WERE TERRIBLE.

206
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:21,252
A FEW OF THEM TALKED ABOUT THE

207
00:05:21,252 --> 00:05:23,187
THREE FAVORITE PEOPLE, ME,

208
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:24,989
MYSELF, AND I, THEY GAVE

209
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:26,757
SPEECHES, THEY KEPT REPEATING

210
00:05:26,757 --> 00:05:27,258
THE SAME THING --

211
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:27,859
>> Laura: OBSESSED WITH

212
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:28,559
DRINKING.

213
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,595
>> I THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY

214
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:31,596
AGITATED TONIGHT, NOT BRETT

215
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,231
KAVANAUGH, YOU KNOW WHO WAS

216
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:34,398
EDUCATED, THE LEFT.

217
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:36,200
BECAUSE THEY SEE THAT

218
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,368
DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP

219
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:38,836
WAS ON THE PRECIPICE OF HAVING A

220
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,805
SECOND SUPREME COURT NOMINEE

221
00:05:40,805 --> 00:05:41,973
CONFIRMED.

222
00:05:41,973 --> 00:05:44,475
ALONG WITH 26 OR SO U.S. CIRCUIT

223
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:44,942
COURT NOMINEES.

224
00:05:44,942 --> 00:05:46,978
>> Laura: [LAUGHS]

225
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:47,778
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

226
00:05:47,778 --> 00:05:49,714
>> THEY DID EVERYTHING -- THEY

227
00:05:49,714 --> 00:05:50,481
GOT NEIL GORSUCH ON THERE, AND

228
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:51,682
THEN THEY SAID, YOU BETTER STOP

229
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:52,984
THE NEXT ONE AND THIS IS THE WAY

230
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:53,851
THEY TRIED TO STOP HIM AND LOOK

231
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:55,686
AT HIM TODAY.

232
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:57,255
>> Laura: BRIAN FALLON'S TWEET

233
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:58,756
AND THAT WHOLE RESISTANCE

234
00:05:58,756 --> 00:05:59,624
GROUP -- IS REPREHENSIBLE.

235
00:05:59,624 --> 00:06:01,659
>> BRIAN FALLON BETTER -- I WANT

236
00:06:01,659 --> 00:06:02,160
TO SAY SOMETHING.

237
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,162
HE BETTER STAY OUT OF MY STATE

238
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,229
BECAUSE THAT IS JUST RUDE.

239
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,698
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED FOR

240
00:06:07,698 --> 00:00:00,000
HILLARY CLINTON PROBABLY HASN'T
