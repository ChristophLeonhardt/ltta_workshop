1
00:00:00,568 --> 00:00:02,470
COULD HANDLE INSTANCES OF

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:02,837
CHEATING.

3
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:04,406
BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO GET AHEAD

4
00:00:04,406 --> 00:00:05,640
OF HIS RECOMMENDATION ABOUT

5
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,375
WHETHER TO STAY IN THE DEAL OR

6
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:07,742
NOT.

7
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:08,376
>> Neil: THANKS.

8
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:11,880
IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT, WE CAN

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,582
TRUST THESE GUYS, THE IRANIANS,

10
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:16,885
HOW CAN WE DEAL WITH THIS GUY?

11
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:18,987
THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA.

12
00:00:18,987 --> 00:00:21,489
RETIRED GENERAL RICHARD NEWTON.

13
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:22,524
GOOD TO HAVE YOU.

14
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:23,725
WE'RE LOOKING INTO THE PROOF

15
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:27,362
THAT THE ISRAELIS HAVE THAT THE

16
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:28,062
IRANIANS HAVE BEEN CHEATING.

17
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:30,899
AT FACE VALUE, DO YOU THINK THEY

18
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:31,199
HAVE?

19
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,236
>> WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON, NEIL.

20
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,305
PROOF WILL BE IN THE PUDDING IN

21
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:38,473
WHAT THE INTELLIGENCE PANS OUT.

22
00:00:38,473 --> 00:00:41,843
I DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO IT.

23
00:00:41,843 --> 00:00:43,244
SECRETARY MATTIS DIDN'T GET OUT

24
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,146
IN FRONT OF WHAT HE'S SEEN OR

25
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:46,181
NOT SOON.

26
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:49,584
I'LL TELL YOU THIS, YOU CANNOT

27
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:52,253
TRUST IRAN.

28
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:55,423
THEY'RE THE LARGEST EXPORTER OF

29
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:55,790
TERRORISM.

30
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,426
THEY'RE NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

31
00:00:58,426 --> 00:00:59,561
IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME THAT

32
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:00,862
PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU HAS THE

33
00:01:00,862 --> 00:01:01,229
EVIDENCE.

34
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,597
IN MY VIEW, I'VE SAID THIS

35
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:03,865
BEFORE, I DON'T THINK THIS IS A

36
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:05,033
GOOD DEAL.

37
00:01:05,033 --> 00:01:07,535
I'M WITH.

38
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,703
TRUMP ON THIS.

39
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:10,305
BUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WILL

40
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:11,940
PERSUADE HIM TO REIMPOSE

41
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,710
SANCTIONS ON MAY 12th IS TO BE

42
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,110
DETERMINED.

43
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,546
IT DOES ADD TO OUR FAST PACED

44
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,448
NOT ONLY WITH IRAN DEAL, ALSO

45
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:23,551
WHAT IS FORTH COMING IN NORTH

46
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:23,852
KOREA.

47
00:01:23,852 --> 00:01:27,121
>> AND WHATEVER DEAL THAT WE

48
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,124
ENTER WITH THE NORTH KOREANS CAN

49
00:01:30,124 --> 00:01:32,794
BE VERIFIED.

50
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:33,628
>> ABSOLUTELY.

51
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:35,964
THAT'S WHERE NOT ONLY THE

52
00:01:35,964 --> 00:01:38,500
DIPLOMATS HAVE TO TAKE OVER BUT

53
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,969
GETS DOWN TO THE MAKEUP OF THE

54
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:41,936
WEAPONS INSPECTORS.

55
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,240
MAYBE THROUGH U.N. AND SO FORTH.

56
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,908
I'VE ALWAYS HAD SKEPTICISM

57
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:47,842
REGARDING THIS AGREEMENT WITH

58
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,576
IRAN, WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S

59
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:50,545
ENOUGH TEETH IN IT TO ALLOW THE

60
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:52,347
WEAPONS INSPECTORS TO REALLY DO

61
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:53,281
THEIR JOB.

62
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:55,450
LET'S ALSO REMEMBER, THIS IS

63
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,586
NOT -- THE IRAN DEAL IS NOT A

64
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:58,920
TREATY.

65
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,588
IT'S A BINDING DOCUMENTS.

66
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,756
IT'S AN AGREEMENT.

67
00:02:01,756 --> 00:02:04,125
SO THAT HAS SOME ISSUES.

68
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,227
ALSO THE FACT THAT IT HAS A

69
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,729
SUNSET CLAUSE IN THE NEXT 10 OR

70
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,664
15 YEARS WHERE IRAN COULD BREAK

71
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,066
OUT OF THE DEAL SHOULD IT BE

72
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,167
MOVING FORWARD.

73
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,302
AGAIN, THE PRESIDENT HAS HIS

74
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,105
HANDS FULL WITH THIS ONE,

75
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:18,306
PARTICULARLY WITH PRIME MINISTER

76
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,707
NETANYAHU COMING FORWARD WITH

77
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,241
HIS ED.

78
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:23,745
HE'S COMING ON THE HEELS OF A

79
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:25,647
SUCCESSFUL VISIT WITH FRENCH

80
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:26,481
PRESIDENT MACRON.

81
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:28,149
SECRETARY POMPEO JUST CAME OUT

82
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:31,286
OF NATO IN BRUSSELS A COUPLE

83
00:02:31,286 --> 00:02:32,720
DAYS OR SO AGO.

84
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,524
SO IT'S -- A LOT OF WAIT TO SEE

85
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:37,358
WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

86
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:39,427
THE PRESIDENT HAS A MAJOR

87
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,762
DECISION TO MAKE.

88
00:02:40,762 --> 00:02:41,496
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

89
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:43,197
THE OTHER THOUGHT IS, THE NORTH

90
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:46,401
KOREANS AND THE IRANIANS HAVE

91
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,169
BEEN JOINED AT THE HIP ON A

92
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,237
VARIETY OF THINGS.

93
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,972
IT WILL COME UP WHEN THE

94
00:02:50,972 --> 00:02:52,407
NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN WITH THE

95
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,375
NORTH KOREAN LEADER.

96
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,544
I'M WONDERING SINCE OBVIOUSLY

97
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,779
VERIFICATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN

98
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,948
LACKING IN IRAN, HOW DO WE

99
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:03,184
TIGHTEN IT IN THE CASE OF NORTH

100
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:04,752
KOREA?

101
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,254
THERE'S THIS RONALD REAGAN DEAL,

102
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,055
TRUST AND VERIFY.

103
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:08,356
>> WE'LL HAVE TO DO THAT.

104
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:11,192
ALMOST GO TO SCHOOL ON THE IRAN

105
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:14,262
DEAL AND MAKE IT AS INTRUSIVE AS

106
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:15,863
WE CAN WITH NORTH KOREA.

107
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:18,366
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT THE

108
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,634
MOMENT PRIME MINISTER

109
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:20,868
NETANYAHU'S EVIDENCE WITH THE

110
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:23,304
IRAN DEAL.

111
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:25,807
NORTH KOREA IS WATCHING THIS AS

112
00:03:25,807 --> 00:03:26,107
WELL.

113
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:28,443
HOW HARD AND HOW STRONG WE STAND

114
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:30,211
IN THE SADDLE WILL ALSO HAVE AN

115
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:32,447
IMPACT IN TERMS OF HOW

116
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:35,683
EFFECTIVELY WE ARE TO BE ABLE TO

117
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,051
AGAIN SADDLE NORTH KOREA.

118
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,953
>> Neil: I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON

119
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:39,721
THAT.

120
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:40,655
YOU MAKE SO MANY POINTS.

121
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,091
ONE IS THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN --

122
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:44,959
LET'S SAY WE SHELF THE DEAL WITH

123
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,828
THE IRANIANS.

124
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,930
COULD THAT HURT US IN

125
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,032
NEGOTIATING ONE WITH THE NORTH

126
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,734
KOREANS SAYING THE UNITED STATES

127
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,669
JUST BACKED AWAY, MAYBE WE

128
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,670
SHOULDN'T GO INTO THIS.

129
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,672
>> IF WE BACK AWAY FROM THIS,

130
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,207
IT'S BASED ON U.S. NATIONAL

131
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,876
SECURITY INTERESTS AND WHAT ARE

132
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,478
THE BEST INTERESTS FOR OUR

133
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:06,514
ALLIES IN THE REGION AS WELL.

134
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,416
I THINK OPPOSITE OF THAT.

135
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,550
NORTH KOREA WOULD PROBABLY TAKE

136
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,586
NOTE OF THE FACT THAT THIS

137
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:13,488
ADMINISTRATION, PRESIDENT TRUMP

138
00:04:13,488 --> 00:04:14,589
NOW WITH SECRETARY OF STATE

139
00:04:14,589 --> 00:04:16,391
POMPEO AND SECRETARY MATTIS

140
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:17,425
WON'T PUT UP WITH THINGS THAT

141
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,827
ARE NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE

142
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:20,293
UNITED STATES.

143
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,928
NOT ONLY SHORT TERM BUT

144
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,165
LONG-TERM AS WELL.

145
00:04:24,165 --> 00:04:25,933
I THINK KIM WOULD PROBABLY

146
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,771
NOT -- WOULD TAKE NOTE OF THAT

147
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:30,772
LEADING INTO WHAT THESE --

148
00:04:30,772 --> 00:00:00,000
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM GOING TO
