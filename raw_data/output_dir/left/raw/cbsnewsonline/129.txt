MOST ANONYMOUS LEAKS ARE NOT 

190
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,211
FROM THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 

191
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,813
WHO ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTING 

192
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:54,153
THESE INVESTIGATIONS. 

193
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:55,388
WE FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW. 

194
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,189
WHICH MEANS WE FOLLOW 

195
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,489
PROCEDURES AND WE RESERVE 

196
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,459
JUDGMENT. 

197
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,326
WE COMPLETE OUR INVESTIGATIONS 

198
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,061
AND WE EVALUATE ALL OF THE 

199
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,296
RELEVANT EVIDENCE BEFORE WE 

200
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,097
REACH ANY CONCLUSION. 

201
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:04,397
USION.

202
00:06:04,397 --> 00:06:07,967
THAT IS HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

203
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,435
EXPECT THEIR DEPARTMENT OF

204
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:10,269
JUSTICE TO OPERATE, AND THIS IS

205
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,005
HOW OUR DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO

206
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,240
THAT IS HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 

207
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,874
EXPECT THEIR AMERICAN 

208
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875
GOVERNMENT TO OPERATE AND THAT 

209
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,109
IS HOW HER DEPARTMENT IS GOING 

210
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:17,610
TO OPERATE. 

211
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,344
OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM, EVERYONE 

212
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,313
WHO IS CHARGED WITH A CRIME IS 

213
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,849
PRESUMED INNOCENT UNLESS AND 

214
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:23,816
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. 

215
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:29,322
IT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING 

216
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,556
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CHARGED WITH 

217
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,058
A CRIME ALSO ARE PRESUMED 

218
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,892
INNOCENT. 

219
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,430
INDICTMENT WAS RETURNED TODAY 

220
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,064
BECAUSE PROSECUTORS DETERMINED 

221
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,065
THE EVIDENCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO 

222
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,066
PRESENT THESE ALLEGATIONS TO A 

223
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,834
FEDERAL GRAND JURY. 

224
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,904
OUR ANALYSIS IS BASED SOLELY ON 

225
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,374
THE FACTS, THE LAW, AND 

226
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:53,079
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE POLICIES. 

227
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:53,880
I BRIEFED PRESIDENT DONALD 

228
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,713
TRUMP ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS 

229
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:57,550
EARLIER THIS WEEK. 

230
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,751
THE PRESIDENT IS FULLY AWARE OF 

231
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,587
THE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS TODAY. 

232
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,221
ON MY REMARKS, I HAVE NOT 

233
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:11,964
IDENTIFIED THE VICTIMS. 

234
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:12,565
WE CONFRONT FOREIGN 

235
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:13,165
INTERFERENCE IN AMERICAN 

236
00:07:13,165 --> 00:07:13,466
ELECTIONS. 

237
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,600
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO AVOID 

238
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,201
THINKING POLITICALLY AS 

239
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,236
REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. 

240
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,036
INSTEAD, TO THINK PATRIOTICALLY 

241
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:18,638
AS AMERICANS. 

242
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,108
 AMERICANS.

243
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,676
OUR RESPONSE MUST NOT DEPEND ON

244
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:24,343
WHICH SIDE IS

245
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,578
OUR RESPONSE MUST NOT DEPEND ON 

246
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:26,579
WHICH SIDE WAS VICTIMIZED. 

247
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,748
 ALLN

248
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:29,615
THE INTERNET ALLOWS FOREIGN 

249
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,651
ADVERSARIES TO ATTACK AMERICA 

250
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,286
IN NEW AND UNEXPECTED WAYS. 

251
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,522
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS ARE 

252
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,556
ALWAYS HARD-FOUGHT AND 

253
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:41,427
CONTENTIOUS. 

254
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:42,228
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE 

255
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,029
ADVERSARIES WHO SEEK TO 

256
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,665
EXACERBATE OUR DIVISIONS. 

257
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:47,099
AND TRY TO CONFUSE, DIVIDE AND 

258
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:47,500
CONQUER US. 

259
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,738
SO LONG AS WE ARE UNITED, IN 

260
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,608
OUR COMMITMENT TO THE VALUES IN 

261
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,076
THE CONSTITUTION, THEY WILL NOT 

262
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:01,714
SUCCEED. 

263
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,082
PARTISAN WARFARE FUELED BY 

264
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,117
MODERN TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT 

265
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,420
FAIRLY REFLECT THE GRACE, 

266
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,823
DIGNITY AND UNITY OF THE 

267
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:17,363
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

268
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,197
THE BLAME FOR ELECTION 

269
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:18,998
INTERFERENCE BELONGS ON THE 

270
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,166
CRIMINALS WHO COMMITTED 

271
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,334
ELECTION INTERFERENCE. 

272
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,435
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO 

273
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,068
HOLD THE PERPETRATORS 

274
00:08:23,068 --> 00:08:23,402
ACCOUNTABLE. 

275
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,471
WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD 

276
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:29,308
TO PRESERVE OUR VALUES, PROTECT 

277
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,813
AGAINST FUTURE INTERFERENCE, 

278
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,413
AND DEFEND AMERICA. 

279
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,948
I HAVE TIME TO TAKE A FEW 

280
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:36,248
QUESTIONS. 

281
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:40,119

00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,554
TIMING TODAY ON THE EVE OF THE 

283

PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH PUTIN. 

284
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:44,790
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT?  

285
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,324
AND JUST TODAY THE PRESIDENT 

286
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:57,970
DESCRIBED THE INVESTIGATION AS 

287
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,571
A WITCH HUNT. 

288
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,171
YOUR RESPONSE?  

289
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,606
>> THE TIMING AS I MENTIONED IS 

290
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,807
A FUNCTION OF THE COLLECTION OF 

291
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,042
THE FACTS, THE EVIDENCE AND THE 

292
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,076
LAW IN DETERMINATION THAT WAS 

293
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:04,877
SUFFICIENT TO PRESENT AN 

294
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,711
INDICTMENT AT THIS TIME. 

295
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,113
AS I MENTIONED, I DID BRIEF THE 

296
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:07,413
PRESIDENT. 

297
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,147
WITH REGARD TO THE 

298
00:09:08,147 --> 00:09:09,048

OUR INDICTMENTS AND OUR 

302
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:12,084
CHARGES. 

303
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,220
IT REPRESENTS DETERMINATION BY 

304
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,054
PROSECUTORS AND AGENTS WITHOUT 

305
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:19,125
REGARD TO POLITICS AND WE 

306
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,126
BELIEVE IT IS SUFFICIENT TO 

307
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:20,927
JUSTIFY THE CHARGES. 

308
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,161
UTY ATTORNI

WERE CHANGED AS A RESULT OF 

314
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,305
THIS HACKING, BUT YOU DID SAY A 

315
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:43,716
COMPANY USED AS A PASS-THROUGH 

316
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,316

IMPACT ON THE ELECTION. 

320
00:09:47,152 --> 00:09:48,354
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THE 

321
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,488
EVIDENCE SHOWS IN THAT RESPECT?

ACCORDING TO THE ALLEGATIONS IN

THE INDICTMENT, THE GOAL OF THE 

326
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:56,495
CONSPIRATORS WAS TO HAVE AN 

327
00:09:56,495 --> 00:09:57,296
IMPACT ON THE ELECTION. 

328
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,531

REQUIRED TO PROVE THIS OFFENSE 

332
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:06,005
