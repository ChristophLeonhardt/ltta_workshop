our media culture here is so ingrained in this word ology of the left I think they said oh people kind okay I guess that's the new way of saying it and they all signed up right away one I think they just sort of said oh that's our new instructions let's start saying people kind they follow the order they get in line they get their talking points and they're totally unified on them so all of a sudden names will change overnight one clear one that we talked about in the video is climate change that's perhaps the most obvious the phenomenon that was being described went from global cooling in the 1970s to global warming in the 1990s to climate change when they couldn't demonstrate any additional global warming for 15 years they said we'll call it climate change because now it's unfalsifiable of course climate changes but this is used as a cudgel as a rhetorical cudgel to get in socialism by the backdoor with Beck public policies that the left has wanted for years they do it on so many things and ironically they will take words and add these little modifiers and make them precisely the opposite this is not new ground George Orwell predicted this in 1984 George Carlin predicted this 20 years ago and it's these soft words that are utterly insidious so a lot of times you'll hear conservatives say oh well who cares who cares if they want to say happy holidays instead of Merry Christmas this is this is a big one in the United States now we have holiday cards or holiday trees instead of Christmas trees who cares well if it doesn't matter if nobody cares then why are you forcing me to use a new word yes because these new words carry whole premises and we can't let them get away with it that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
