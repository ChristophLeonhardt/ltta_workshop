00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:48,949
COUNTRY.

26
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,351
THE BANNERS SAY MAKE ISRAEL

CAMPAIGN PROMISE SOMETHING HE

33
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,760
SAID HE WOULD DO.

34
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,161
OTHER PRESIDENTS SAID THEY WOULD

35
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,896
DO THIS AND THEY DIDN'T.

36
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,565
IT WAS OVER 20 YEARS SINCE

37
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,433
CONGRESS PASSED THE JERUSALEM

38
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,835

SOME YEARS, DECADES IN SOME

43
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,645
CASES AS LAWMAKERS TRY TO FIGURE

OUT MOVING THE EMBASSY FROM

45
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:21,815
TEL AVIV TO JERUSALEM.

46
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,783
WHAT CHANGED WITH THIS

47
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,150
PRESIDENT?

48
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,685
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS

49
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:25,118
TAKING ACTION.

50
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,587
WHETHER IT IS THIS.

51
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,023

RIGHT THING TO DO.

56
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,196
THIS IS THE CAPITAL OF ISRAEL.

57
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,265
ISRAEL IS ONE OF OUR CLOSEST

58
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:38,966
PARTNERS.

59
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,169
ISRAEL IS ABSOLUTELY FIGHTING

60
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,104

HERE IN ISRAEL.

109
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:06,453
VERY PROUD TO REPRESENT

IT IS NOT COINCIDENTAL THIS IS

118
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,368
THE WEEK THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,770
SAID WE'RE GETTING OUT OF A BAD

120
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,339

HE BELIEVES ARE THE RIGHT

138
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:56,236
LONG-TERM DECISIONS AND NOT JUST

139
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,105
KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD.

140
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,906
