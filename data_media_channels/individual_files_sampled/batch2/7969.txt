representative Ron de santis from Florida is in the news again following his terrible racist statement regarding his black Democratic gubernatorial opponent Gilliam we talked about that yesterday he accused voters of monkeying this thing up if they end up voting for Gilliam well now we have some more details on who Ron de santis really is Media Matters did an investigation into a questionable Facebook group a racist horrible Facebook group that Ron de santis was actually an administrator of so de santis was one of 52 administrators and moderators of the Tea Party group which is not affiliated with the official Tea Party Patriots including former Arizona Republican Senate candidate Kelly Ward no shocker there and Virginia GOP Senate candidate Corey Stewart both of whom still serve as admins now when Natalie Martinez with Media Matters broke this story and tweeted about it De Santis was like oh yeah let's just be cool be cool didn't know long I'm no longer admin what are you talking about not at like well how much of a joke can you possibly be like it doesn't make it better if you after the story comes out decide to no longer be the admin but let me give you more details several members of the group have shared de santis a 's campaign posts with one specifically naming the candidate as an admin of the group with nearly 95 thousand members which is depressing by the way like 95 thousand people were like yeah yeah I totally love this page so why was this page so problematic the group's members have shared racist misogynistic and offensive posts including post slamming parkland shooting survivors and disparaging black lives matter activists comparing both to Hitler that makes sense okay also in one of the posts that was Islamophobic a person posted about Trump and said President Trump eats bacon just one more reason to elect him in 2020 and then continue to say oh I'm sorry and then a calm in that post said unlike the last guy meaning Obama at least you know he isn't a Muslim mole because yeah that's what Obama was a Muslim mole as you wish propping like bombs in muslim-majority countries and killing countless civilians Muslim civilians yeah Muslim wall all the way yeah Obama drop somebody bombs then they ran out of bombs literally ran out of bombs in the was a February of two years ago or three years ago so that it's look this is just a it's a forum for hate it and it's stomach-turning as Anna says to see those numbers of people who who go in for it and contribute it and contribute to it and and lift it to another level so as things were getting I'm not sure you pointed out yet but the people that were promoting him it's in the group so I didn't want to bring it up a few hadn't yet I had not but he's getting promoted by certain people within this this Facebook group hate group and on purpose obviously he's running for governor so as he's getting promoted throughout the group then as you said he decides to jump back out of it there's nothing the point of this whole being the reason they brought this background of him up is because what happened right after he won his primary and he's gonna face off in the in the general election and then he decides to bring up the monkey it up comment right so now his background gets gets pointed out if you don't think the point of bringing all this up if you don't think these guys don't know who they're appealing to who they're speaking to and how they're speaking to them you're wrong they don't go into interviews without knowing what they're gonna say without being coached up on talking points without having things scribbled on their hands the way Sarah Palin did there's a approach they have there's there's a this reason they're called talking points they know what they're supposed to say you're not supposed called a democratic debate and that same sentence where he said monkey things up he said the democratic debate that's a well-known you're supposed to call them rats so your brain goes all Democrats are rats that's right Democrats are rats so when he says something like monkeying it up you don't hear them always say that yeah you might think that it was a plan ahead of time no you don't know because there's no proof of it but we know the politicians especially at this level don't just randomly say things without having a meaning behind it and when you're part of a group and of a group that does things like this you continue to notice and when you hurry up and get your name off the admin group once it's been discovered you also know you don't want your name to be connected to it on a wide scale because they're continuing to find out who you really are yeah and I just want to reiterate that monkey it up is not a phrase right monkey business is monkey around is he said monkey it up which is not a phrase it's not something that people say it's not an expression the fact that he decided to use that phrase in his description of gilliam who's a black Democratic opponent of his says something and so you know yesterday when we covered that story Janke said that it is a very specific targeted strategy of DeSantis and it took a look it took a lot to convince me of that but this story is relevant because it gives you a sense of who he is what his background is what he truly believes no one would agree to be an admin to a page like this unless they subscribe to the crazy stuff that's posted there and just one final thing I wanted to save the best for last they also share all sorts of conspiracy theories the group's members have also denied that the far-right white supremacist rally in Charlottesville took place in August of 2017 claiming that it was a hoax orchestrated by the left to destroy America so that's who these people are and up until recently DeSantis was an administrator of this page in case you don't remember this guy in the White House also after the Charlottesville rally that killed that woman sad to say you know there was bad people on both sides and made sure that he was doubling down on that before days later saying okay okay okay fine I couldn't get away with saying that and actually feeding that red meat to my base whether or not they believe it or not that's who they want to appeal to that is who they that's who they know is that's where their bread and butter is this these guys act all the time as to where they want to be and honestly if you even if you say hey I didn't mean that the fact that you said it means that you at least mean it to someone else well right it's it's fuel on a brush fire for sure and and I whether or not they really believe it I mean it's it doesn't matter because of just that never miss another TYT video by ringing the bell below you'll get notified
