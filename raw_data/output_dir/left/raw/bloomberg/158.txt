00:00:06,605 --> 00:00:11,878

00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:19,519
INVESTORS DITCHING HP.

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,424
PLUS FLYING TO APPLE'S DEFENSE

6
00:00:24,424 --> 00:00:25,191
IN A TAX DISPUTE IN EUROPE.

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,493
AND WHAT ARE PUBLIC MARKET

8
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:29,562
INVESTORS LOOKING FOR WHEN THEY

9
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:30,597
DECIDE TO BACK A STARTUP?

00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:33,466
WE WILL LOOK AT OUR WEEKLY

11
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,802
INVESTING ROUNDTABLE.

12
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,537
FIRST TO OUR LEAD -- SHARES OF

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,440
HP ARE LOWER IN AFTER-HOURS

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,741
TRADING.

15
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:43,343
THIS IS THE SIDE OF THE COMPANY

16
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,712
FORMALLY KNOWN -- FORMERLY KNOWN

17
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,282
AS HEWLETT-PACKARD AND IS KNOWN

18
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,618
FOR ITS PRINTERS.

19
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,254
IT BEAT ESTIMATES AND SALES OF

20
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:58,358
COMPUTERS WERE FLAT.

21
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,125
GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,794
MISSED ANALYST EXPECTATIONS.

23
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,695
JOINING US TO DIG INTO THE

24
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:03,663
FUTURE OF HP PRINTERS AS

25
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:05,665
COMPUTERS IS OUR BLOOMBERG

26
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,634
CONTRIBUTOR EDITOR DAVID

27
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:10,003
KIRKPATRICK AND ARE SENIOR

28
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,038
ANALYST.

29
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:14,474
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE EARNINGS --

30
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:20,312
HOW BAD WAS THIS?

31
00:01:20,312 --> 00:01:25,985
GUEST: THE QUALITY OF THE

32
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:27,654
NUMBERS WAS VERY NEXT.

33
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,454
THERE WAS A LOT OF INVENTORY

34
00:01:28,454 --> 00:01:29,155
RESHUFFLE IN THE CHANNEL.

35
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,058
I THOUGHT EXECUTION IS GETTING

36
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,092
BETTER AND THEY ARE FOCUSING ON

37
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:37,563
THE RIGHT THING, BUT Q3 WAS OK

38
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:41,100
AND Q4 GUIDANCE, I THOUGHT THE

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,337
PC BUSINESS PERFORMED WELL AND

40
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,271
THEY ARE FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT

41
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,140
THING, THEY ARE FOCUSING ON THE

42
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,611
RIGHT THING AND IN THE PRINTING

43
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,378
BUSINESS, THEY ARE TAKING A

44
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,214
DIFFERENT TACK IN THAT THEY ARE

45
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,816
WILLING TO PLACE WEAKER PROFIT

46
00:01:56,816 --> 00:02:01,321
PRINTERS FOR THE SUPPLY CONTRACT

47
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:02,422
IN THE LONG RUN.

48
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,425
I THINK IT IS ALL THE RIGHT

49
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:10,562
FOCUS THERE'S A LOT OF MESSINESS

50
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:11,364
NEAR TERM THAT SHOVELS OUT.

51
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:14,500
RAMY: UBS CAME OUT WITH A NOTE

52
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,371
POINTING OUT 80% OF ITS PROFITS

53
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,772
CAME FROM PRINTERS WHICH I FOUND

54
00:02:19,772 --> 00:02:20,540
QUITE SURPRISING BECAUSE WHEN

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:25,645
YOU THINK ABOUT HP -- I HAD HP

56
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,412
COMPUTER YEARS AGO AND I WAS

57
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,013
THINKING OF THAT.

58
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,848
WHAT DO YOU THINK IN TERMS OF

59
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,884
DIVERSIFICATION?

60
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:31,885
DAVID: THEY ARE NOT A VERY

61
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:32,886
DIVERSIFIED COMPANY AT THE

62
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,319
MOMENT.

63
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,156
I THINK THEY ARE IN A FITTING

64
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:39,125
FROM THE SEPARATION OF THE OTHER

65
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:39,892
PART OF HP AND WE CAN FOCUS ON

66
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:41,427
THESE BUSINESSES AND THE THAT

67
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:44,697
THEY ARE HAVING GROWTH IN THE PC

68
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:45,765
BUSINESS NOW AND GET CREDIT FOR

69
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:48,201
THAT.

70
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:49,001
I WAS OUT THERE JUST LAST WEEK

71
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:51,704
BY COINCIDENCE AND THEY HAVE

72
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:52,438
SOME PRETTY COOL TECHNOLOGY

73
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,873
COMING OUT OF THEIR PRINTER

74
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:56,542
BUSINESS, A LOT OF WHICH IS

75
00:02:56,542 --> 00:03:00,012
RELATED TO GOING TOWARD DIGITAL

76
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:00,713
PRINTING WHICH IS EXTREMELY

77
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,214
SOPHISTICATED.

78
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:05,251
THEY HAVE TECHNOLOGY FOR DIGITAL

79
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:05,852
EQUIPMENT THAT IS

80
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,820
STATE-OF-THE-ART AND COULD

81
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,454
GENERATE GREAT GROWTH

82
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:08,955
OPPORTUNITY.

83
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:12,492
RAMY: YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER

84
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,192
ABOUT 3-D PRINTING AND

85
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,094
SEMI-CONDUCTORS.

86
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:19,132
DAVID: THEY HAVE 3-D PRINTING

87
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:19,832
TECHNOLOGY THEY CLAIM IS

88
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:24,404
SUPERIOR TO ANYONE AND CAN BED

89
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,138
THEN INTO THE DEVICES THEY

90
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,472
CREATE.

91
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:27,306
THEY USE THE SAME PRINTER HEADS

92
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:30,943
THEY USE FOR THEIR BIG

93
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:31,878
INDUSTRIAL PRINTERS IN THE 3-D

94
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,112
PRINTERS, SO THEY ARE ABLE TO

95
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:33,980
LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY THEY ALREADY

96
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,183
HAVE TWO GET INTO WHAT COULD BE

97
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,218
A NEW BUSINESS.

98
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,421
RAMY: DO YOU THINK THIS IS THE

99
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:41,821
FUTURE?

100
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,391
GUEST: I HAVE A LACKADAISICAL

101
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:49,295
OPINION, TO PUT IT MILDLY.

102
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,564
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A BIG

103
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,566
ENOUGH MARKET.

104
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,401
3-D PRINTING GENERALLY.

105
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,237
WHAT THEY ARE DOING, GOING AFTER

106
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:01,107
THE OFFICE PRINTING MARKET, THE

107
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:06,279
BIG MACHINES IN OFFICES, ON THE

108
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:09,315
THIRD FLOOR IN THE CORNER, THAT

109
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,116
IS A MARKET HEAVILY CORNERED BY

110
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,284
JAPANESE OFFICE EQUIPMENT

111
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,920
MAKERS.

112
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,720
THAT IS AN INTERESTING MARKET

113
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,488
BECAUSE THE DEVICE IS POSSIBLE

114
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,625
AND THE SUPPLIES GOING TO THEM

115
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:21,728
HAVE A FASTER REFRESH RATE OR

116
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,162
CONSUMPTION RATE AND IT MAKES

117
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,633
FOR A PROFITABLE SUPPLY MARKET.

118
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:31,070
THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING

119
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,971
MARKET BUT I'M NOT SURE THE 3-D

120
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,406
PRINTING MARKET IS ANYTHING MORE

121
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:39,278
THAN A SMALL MARKET.

122
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:40,079
DAVID: I WAS INTRIGUED BY SOME

123
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,715
OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY FOR PRODUCT

124
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:47,620
TURNING LABELS AND PRINTING JOBS

125
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,454
AND THEY NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO

126
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,757
EMBED UNIQUE CODES INTO AN

127
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:55,828
INDIVIDUAL UNIT OF A PRODUCT OR

128
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,662
MAGAZINE THAT CAN BE READ WITH A

129
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:57,063
CAMERA.

130
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:58,598
IT IS AN INTERESTING NEW SLANT

131
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,433
ON WHAT YOU COULD DO WITH

132
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:04,003
DIGITAL PRINTING AND THEY CLAIM

133
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,171
THERE IS SOME GROWTH THERE.

134
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:05,938
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

135
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:11,244
GUEST: THE TECHNOLOGY IS COOL

136
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,044
AND NEED BUT IS IT A BIG ENOUGH

137
00:05:12,044 --> 00:05:12,411
OR GET?

138
00:05:12,411 --> 00:05:16,249
THE MARKET NEEDS TO BE LARGE,

139
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:18,117
PROFITABLE AND GROWING.

140
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:22,488
HP NEEDS TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES

141
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,189
THAT ARE NOT REALLY COOL.

142
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:25,791
IT NEEDS TO ATTACK THREE PRONGS

143
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,526
OF ANY MARKET GOES AFTER.

144
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:31,430
RAMY: WE HAVE SEEN MIGRATION

145
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,164
FROM CONSUMER TO BUSINESS.

146
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:36,168
LET'S MOVE TO PCS -- IN TERMS OF

147
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:40,173
LEVELING OFF, TAKE THAT.

148
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:44,644
GUEST: WE SAW NUMBERS FROM THE

149
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:48,080
MARKET RESEARCH FIRMS SUGGESTING

150
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,915
THAT THE U.S. FOR THE FIRST TIME

151
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:49,649
IN YEARS HAD YEAR ON YEAR

152
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,284
GROWTH.

153
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,818
EASY ELEMENTS OF THE PC MARKET

154
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:55,988
DOING WELL -- GAMING IS DOING

155
00:05:55,988 --> 00:06:00,893
WELL, CONVERTIBLES, CONFESSIONAL

156
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:01,928
PRO CONSUMERS, IT'S A SMALL

157
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:06,032
SEGMENT BUT THESE ARE PRICED AT

158
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:12,805
$1200 OR $1500 AND UP OF.

159
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:13,606
THERE ARE SEGMENTS AND HP HAS

160
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,675
DONE A BETTER JOB FOCUSING ON

161
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,377
THAT SEGMENT AND IT'S ONE OF THE

162
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,412
TOP THREE FROM A SHARE

163
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:20,212
PERSPECTIVE, SO IT IS DOING WELL

164
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,114
FOR THE QUESTION IS IS IT

165
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:25,217
SUSTAINABLE AND WE SAW SOME

166
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,953
STRONG GAINS IN 2014 IN

167
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:31,490
COMMERCIAL PCS, WHETHER THE

168
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,291
CONSUMER IS READY TO TAKE THE

169
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,060
BATON AND REPLACE THESE VERY OLD

170
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,528
PCS WITH NEW ONES.

171
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:41,534
RAMY: I WANT TO PULL BACK ON THE

172
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,068
ENTIRE FOCUS.

173
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:42,868
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HPE AS ONE

174
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:43,770
ENTITY.

175
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,372
DO YOU THINK THE SPINOFF IS

176
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,741
WORKING FOR THEM?

177
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,078
DAVID: THEY NEED CLARITY ON

178
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,845
THESE IS THIS IS THAT WERE

179
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:53,546
MUDDIED TOGETHER INTO ONE

180
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,350
COMPOUND HOLE.

181
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,184
HPE IS IN MANY WAYS A SOFTWARE

182
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:58,584
COMPANY.

183
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:03,222
I THINK THE FACT HP IS GAINING

184
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,890
MARKET SHARE ON LENOVO WHICH IS

185
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,758
NUMBER ONE IN PCS IS SIGNIFICANT

186
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,629
AND SOMETIMES FOCUS CAN REALLY

187
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:14,000
BENEFIT A COMPANY AND I THINK

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,102
THEY HAVE MORE POTENTIAL FOCUS.

189
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:16,869
I WOULD BE MILDLY OPTIMISTIC

190
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:19,071

199
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,724
IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE WHERE

200
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:42,061
WE GO FROM HERE GIVEN THAT HP

OFFSHORE.

300
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:45,824
IT HAS SPARKED INVESTIGATIONS BY

301
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,326
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION.

302
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:52,364
AT STAKE, POSSIBLY BILLIONS OF

DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS

313
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:16,589
CRITICISM HERE?

314
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,124
DO YOU THINK IN ALL HONESTY AND

TREASURY AND AUTHORITIES IN

TO PAY THE TAXES WHERE THEY ARE

322
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,580

DAVID: ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

330
00:15:00,332 --> 00:15:03,602
AMAZES ME IS THEY HAVE SO MUCH

331
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,436
PROFIT TO DEAL WITH AND THEY

332
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:06,438
HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT

333
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:07,339
OF PROFITABLE REVENUE HE HAS

334
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,475
CREATED.

335
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,176
IT IS AN AMAZING PROBLEM TO HAVE

336
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,445
THEM PROBABLY NO COMPANY HAS

337
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,012

LEW HAS SAID THE EUROPEAN

340
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,385

U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING APPLE,

342
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,456

00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,391
ARE U.S. COMPANIES BEING

346

347
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,232
OF VIEW, I WOULD SAY YES.

348
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,200
THERE'S NOT A REAL UNDERSTANDING

349
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,371
OF THE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY AND

350
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,207
WHAT THE EU IS TRYING TO DO, THE

351
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:47,513
WAY THEY HANDLE PERSONAL DATA,

352
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:48,814
STORING EVERYTHING LOCALLY, IT'S

353
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,482
NOT REASONABLE THESE COMPANIES

354
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:53,819
TO OPERATE THE WAY THEY DO AND

355
00:15:53,819 --> 00:16:00,859
STRUCTURE THEIR DATA THAT WAY.

356
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:04,263
THERE'S A VERY PAROCHIAL

357
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,098
NATIONAL AND REGIONAL APPROACH I

358
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:06,999
DON'T THINK REALLY SERVES ANYONE

359
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,332

SOMETHING EASILY WRAPPED UP? IS

362
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,671

364
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,345
BIASED BECAUSE I AM A BRIT BUT

365
00:16:20,345 --> 00:16:22,848

SINGLE NATIONSTATE, IT IS 27

367
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,852
STATES AND ALAN THINK OF THOSE

368
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,721
IF YOU ARE THE COMMISSION OR

369
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,422
RELEVANT AUTHORITY IS VERY

370
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:30,923
DIFFICULT.

371
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:34,126
THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE MAINLAND

372
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:34,960
IS CLEARLY TO TAX HELL OUT OF

373
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,863
THEM AND BRITAIN, IT'S A BIT

374
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,833
MORE LACKADAISICAL.

375
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,969
THE BALANCE IN THOSE INTEREST IS

376
00:16:43,969 --> 00:16:49,341

DO YOU THINK SOME OF THIS IS

381
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:57,983

382

383
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:01,853
AN ELEMENT OF THAT KIND OF

384
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:02,354
DISCRIMINATION?

385

ALEX: I'M WARY OF STEPPING IN TO

386

STEREOTYPES BUT IF YOU ARE

392
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:19,972
SHOULD BE TAXED IN EUROPE IN

411

FROM A POLICY PROPOSAL REVIEW,

422
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:22,801
TRUMP HAS ALMOST NOTHING.

423
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,037

INCLUDING PLACES LIKE YOURS.

658
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,264
THERE'S SO MUCH MONEY AND EVEN

659
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:50,935

00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:52,603

CONVENTIONAL PLAYERS IN HERE

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,984
MILLION, $50 MILLION, AND YOU

EARLY-STAGE INVESTOR INC..

669
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:14,859
YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME OF THE

670
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:18,162
OTHER ASPECTS FOR THE COMPANY

671
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,832
AND I THINK COMING AT IT FROM A

672
00:33:21,832 --> 00:33:22,600
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ANGLES IS

673
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,469
IMPORTANT OR IT TO MATURE INTO A

674
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:28,940
BILLION-DOLLAR COMPANY.

675
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,740
>> WE HEAR ABOUT HOW SILICON

676
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,677
VALLEY IS SO RELATIONSHIP DRIVEN

677
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,145
AND IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO YOU KNOW

678
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:39,817
AND HOW SILICON VALLEY COMPANY

679
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:40,885
CAN SAY TO AN ENTREPRENEUR THAT

680
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:41,586
WE CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO

681
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,088
INVESTORS.

682
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:44,922
WE CAN BRING YOU THE COO AND WE

683
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:46,724
HAVE THE EXPERTISE.

684
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:51,029
DO INVESTORS HAVE IN-HOUSE

685
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,797
EXPERTISE THAT IS NEEDED?

686
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,634
GUEST: I THINK SOME ARE WORKING

687
00:33:56,634 --> 00:34:00,505
TOWARD IT.

688
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,405
I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL WHEN I

689
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:02,106
SEE MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES

690
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,475
WRITING BIG CHECKS BECAUSE IS IT

691
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,777
THE LORE OF THE RETURN OR HAVE

692
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:08,179
THEY DONE NOT ONLY THE VALUATION

693
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:08,980
WORK, WHICH IS THE EASY PART,

694
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,949
BUT THE ANALYSIS?

695
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:18,188
WE RECENTLY HAD A CLIENT ASK US

696
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,024
NOT TO INVEST ANY MONEY

697
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:21,891
SPECIFICALLY IN PRIVATE

698
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,562
COMPANIES BECAUSE IT COMES WITH

699
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:29,800
THE ONGOING VALUATION THIS AND

700
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,568
IT DEPENDS ON THE STRUCTURE.

701
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,703
MAYBE IF THEY PUT IN ON A

702
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:35,773
COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT TRUST, IT

703
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,708
MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE IF WE

704
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:40,378
HAVE A DOWNTURN AND PEOPLE ARE

705
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,045
KNOCKING ON THE DOOR FOR

706
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:42,612
LIQUIDITY.

707
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:43,481
>> WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE

708
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,382
COMING IN REEVALUATING HOW THEY

709
00:34:45,382 --> 00:34:48,553
USE TART UPS AND WE HAVE SEEN

710
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:51,589
VALUATIONS DUMBING DOWN.

711
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,389
WHERE DO YOU STAND ON THAT?

712
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,493
HOW OUT OF WHACK HAVE THINGS

713
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:56,627
GOTTEN AND HOW COMFORTABLE ARE

714
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:57,628
YOU VALUATIONS ARE WHERE THEY

715
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,397
SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW?

716
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:03,568
GUEST: YOU HAD A LOT OF

717
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,003
NONTRADITIONAL MONEY COME INTO

718
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:06,871
THE MARKET AND USUALLY WHEN THAT

719
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,006
COMES IN, VALUATION GOES UP.

720
00:35:09,006 --> 00:35:09,774
THERE ARE OTHER DEALS THAT

721
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,909
SHOULD NOT BE FUNDED THAT ARE.

722
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,611
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR,

723
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,780
THAT HEALED BACK AND VALUATIONS

724
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,783
BECAME A LITTLE MORE REALISTIC.

725
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,786
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

726
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,620
FUNDS RAISED, IT WAS A BUMPER

727
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,390
YEAR WHICH TO ME SAYS THIS IS AN

728
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,692
INVESTOR LED DOWNTURN AND I

729
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,429
DON'T THINK INVESTORS ARE

730
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,697
DISAPPOINTED FOR TOO LONG.

731
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,800
GUEST: I THINK WHEN WE TAKE A

732
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,534
STEP BACK AND YOU LOOK AT MY

733
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:38,703
THAT EQUITY, FOCUSING THEIR

734
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:42,840
MONEY RIGHT NOW, YOU SEE IT

735
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,607
THROUGH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

736
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:46,210
LENS.

737
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:46,977
WE SEE IT AS THE LOWER TURN

738
00:35:46,977 --> 00:35:47,778
ENVIRONMENT HAS LEFT INVESTOR

739
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:48,813
LANDS THAT HAVE NOT LOWERED

740
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,849
RETURN RATES TO SOME DEGREE

741
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:55,853
CHASING THE RETURN AND THAT

742
00:35:55,853 --> 00:35:57,988
SOMETIMES DOES NOT END WELL,

743
00:35:57,988 --> 00:35:58,789
SAME THING FOR THE SOVEREIGN

744
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:00,291
WEALTH FUND.

745
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,192
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM REGULARS

746
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:02,626
AND WASHINGTON THAT THEY HAVE

747
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:07,198
WESTON'S ABOUT NONTRADITIONAL

748
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:10,034
INVESTORS.

749
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,171
IS THERE ENOUGH -- ENOUGH

750
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,074
EXPOSURE WHICH BY NATURE ARE

751
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,844
VERY CLOSE TO MAY WANT TO GROW

752
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,811
AND DO NOT WANT THE SCRUTINY

753
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:21,912
FROM OUTSIDE.

754
00:36:21,912 --> 00:36:23,914
IF YOU ARE BRINGING IN A MUTUAL

755
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:26,884
FUND, SHOULD THERE BE A MID-TIER

756
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:30,054
OF REGULATION OR WE NEED CERTAIN

757
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:32,990
DISCLOSURES WE ARE NOT GETTING

758
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,824
BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY

759
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:36,227
NONTRADITIONAL INVESTORS?

760
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:41,465
GUEST: I THINK THE QUESTION IS

761
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,199
WHETHER MUTUAL FUND HOLDERS

762
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:42,933
SHOULD BE INVEST RING IN THAT

763
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:45,503
MARKET.

764
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:48,105
WITH THE QUESTION OF REGULATION,

765
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:48,939
IT CAN HAMPER GROWTH AND DO YOU

766
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:52,343
WANT THAT IMPLICATION?

767
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,445
>> YOU TALK ABOUT GROWTH STAGE A

768
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:56,614
LOT.

769
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,816
TALK ABOUT HOW IT'S

770
00:36:58,816 --> 00:36:59,683
DISTINGUISHED ME EARLIER STAGES

771
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:01,652
AND LATER STAGES AND WHY IS THAT

772
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:03,487
IMPORTANT?

773
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:06,157
>> WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA

774
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:08,492
WHEN IT COMES TO CUSTOMERS AND

775
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,861
REVENUE PROFITS.

776
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:11,662
YOU HAVE AN IDEA AND A PRODUCT

777
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,231
YOU ARE TRYING TO CHASE AFTER

778
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,032
AND IT IS REALLY THE NUMBERS.

779
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:17,568
YOU ARE LOOKING AT PROFITABILITY

780
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:22,573
MARGIN RATIOS AND I THINK YOU DO

781
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,340
HAVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE A BIT

782
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,611
OF A PROVEN TRACK RECORD, BUT IT

783
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,847
IS STILL VERY PEOPLE ORIENTED.

784
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,681
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THREE

785
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,617
PARTS, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE

786
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,653
IT TO THE NEXT JOB.

787
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,622
I THINK IT IS AN AREA WHERE YOU

788
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:41,659
DON'T WANT TO REPURPOSE TALENT

789
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,460
IN AREAS THAT ARE ONLY LOOKING

790
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:42,927
AT NUMBERS.

791
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,863
I THINK YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF

792
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,732
MISTAKES THERE.

793
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:52,103
>> YOU HAVE THEN A PIONEER IN

794
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:52,837
ENLISTING PRIVATE EQUITY.

795
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,906
TELL US HOW YOUR RISK APPETITE

796
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:56,707
IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER TYPES OF

797
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:59,110
INVESTORS.

798
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,145
>> WE GOT INADVERTENTLY CAUGHT

799
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:01,879
UP IN THIS ALTERNATIVE

800
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,614
INVESTMENT CRAZE AND PRIVATE

801
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,917
EQUITY IS AN ASSET CLASS.

802
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,553
WE ARE INVESTING IN TERMS THAT

803
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:13,557
ARE FEEDER FUNDS TO TOP FIRMS

804
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,961
TRYING TO GIVE THE INVESTOR THAT

805
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:21,031
BUFFER AND I THINK THE SEC

806
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:21,799
SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

807
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,001
PROPER DISCLOSURE AND THESE

808
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:24,735
COMPANIES ARE PUBLIC SO THEY

809
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,004
HAVE TO MEET THAT DISCLOSURE

810
00:38:27,004 --> 00:38:28,906
HURDLE WHICH HELPS PROTECT THE

811
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:29,340
INVESTOR.

812
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,043
I THINK IF YOU ARE PRIVATE, YOU

813
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:35,913
NEED TO TELL SOMEONE THAT

814
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:37,214
SOMETHING MATERIAL IS UP BECAUSE

815
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:41,085
THAT IMPACTS TRADITIONAL LPS.

816
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,387
WE HAVE TRIED TO CREATE A

817
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:44,021
PRODUCT THAT HAS THAT

818
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:44,755
TRANSPARENCY BECAUSE THEY ARE

819
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,192
GOVERNED BY TRADITIONAL

820
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:48,993
REGULATORY BODIES IN THE U.S.

821
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,195
AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. 

822
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,797
>> LOOKING AT THE IPO MARKET

823
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:54,798
WHICH HAS HAD SOME ROUGH PATCHES

824
00:38:54,798 --> 00:38:57,134
THIS YEAR, WE'VE SEEN A LITTLE

825
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,203
ACTION THIS YEAR.

826
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,705
WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK AS WE HEAD

827
00:39:01,705 --> 00:39:02,540
INTO THE END OF THE YEAR AND FOR

828
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,375
BOTH OF YOU, WHAT DO YOU SEE AS

829
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:09,313
THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN IPO'S AND

830
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,215
LIKE THE BIG PUBLICLY TRADING --

831
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,017
TRADED COMPANY COMING IN AND

832
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,486
CLEANING UP SOME OF THESE

833
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,555
STARTUPS THAT THEY'VE JUST GOT

834
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:20,391
SO MUCH CASH AND THEY ARE

835
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:23,327
WORRIED ABOUT THIS GUY COMING IN

836
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:26,564
EATING THEIR LUNCH?

837
00:39:26,564 --> 00:39:32,002
GUEST: WE ARE LESS CONCERNED

838
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:32,803
ABOUT WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO

839
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,071
GO PUBLIC OR BE ACQUIRED.

840
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:34,905
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THEY ARE

841
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:36,974
GOING TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER A

842
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:37,875
QUALITY PRODUCT AND MAKE QUALITY

843
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,744
EARNINGS OFF OF THAT.

844
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,278
WHETHER WE ARE ACQUIRED AGO

845
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,646
PUBLIC IS A SECONDARY THOUGHT

846
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:47,785
BUT I THINK THE MARKET IS

847
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,453
OPENING AND THE TECH IPOS HAVE

848
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:51,589
REALLY PERFORMED WELL IN THE

849
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,723
MARKET.

850
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:56,961
>> IN THE LAST COUPLE OF SECONDS

851
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:58,763
BEFORE WE GO TO COMMERCIAL?

852
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,933
>> WE WOULD PREFER TO SEE

853
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:07,605
STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, BUT AS A

854
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:09,807
GENERAL RULE, EARNINGS ARE NOT

855
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:13,010
GROWING AFTER SHARE BUYBACKS ARE

856
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,879
ABATED.

857
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,780
YOU HAVE TO ASK WHAT IS THEIR

858
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,581
REAL MOTIVE?

859
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,049
ARE THEY BUYING REVENUES OR A

860
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:23,020
STRATEGIC IT FOR THEIR BUSINESS?

861
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,924

INVESTING IN VENTURE CAPITAL.

871
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:14,491
ONE COULD ARGUE COMPANIES AND

HOW YOU SEE THAT CHANGING AND

MORE COMPANIES FEELING LIKE THEY

879
00:43:33,043 --> 00:43:33,944
NEED TO HAVE A VENTURE CAPITAL

GO INTO THE VENTURE SPACE, YOU

883
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:42,553
NEED TO HAVE THAT TALENT.

884
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:44,555
IT IS DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES

885
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:47,691
AND EACH ONE REQUIRES A

886
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:48,959
DIFFERENT WAY TO LOOK AT THE

887
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,227

888
00:43:50,227 --> 00:43:52,930

GOOD SENSE.

921
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:34,698

THE END OF THE YEAR.

HOW DO YOU SEE THAT CHANGING?

926
00:45:45,776 --> 00:45:48,011
>> I'M NOT SURE I KNOW EXACTLY

927
00:45:48,011 --> 00:45:54,050
WHAT IS HOT.

REAL ASSETS INCLUDING STARTUPS,

929
00:45:57,654 --> 00:46:01,158
I WILL SAY STABLE CASH FLOW IS

930
00:46:01,158 --> 00:46:03,193
GETTING A PREMIUM.

931
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:05,229
PEOPLE ARE UNDERSTANDING

932
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,231
VALUATION MAY BE STRETCHED AND

933
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:07,998
COULD THEY STRETCHED FOR A

934
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:09,800
WHILE, BUT IF PEOPLE CAN SHOW

935
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,669
THEY HAVE CLASS -- HAVE CASH

936
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:15,739
FLOW BUSINESS MODELS, THEIR CASH
