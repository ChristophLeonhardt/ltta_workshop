1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
On Sept. 8, 2016, the Osiris-Rex 
spacecraft will rise on a tongue of fire.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Leaving Earth on a seven-year mission to snatch 
part of an ancient asteroid and carry it home.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Its target is Bennu, a diamond shaped 
clump of rubble a quarter mile wide.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Asteroids like Bennu were the building blocks 
of the early solar system, 4.5 billion years ago.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Most of these chunks of primordial 
stuff merged long ago ...

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
... in violent collisions, to shape 
the young Earth and other planets.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But Bennu survived, pushed and 
prodded by the gravity of the planets.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Today, Bennu has a regular, 14-month orbit, 
which swings it close to Earth every six years.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
But sunlight warms the surface of the asteroid ...

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
... gradually shifting its orbit in a way
that could eventually threaten the Earth.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Osiris-Rex will take two years to reach Bennu, 
then spend a year mapping its surface.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In July, 2020, the spacecraft
will pick a spot and descend.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And try to steal a chunk of the primordial past,
for humans to study for decades to come.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
An 11-foot arm unfolds and extends.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The spacecraft drops, and
briefly touches the asteroid.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A puff of nitrogen blows a few ounces
of ancient dust from the surface.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A cosmic high five, before the
spacecraft retreats to safety.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The sample is weighed and 
stowed in a fireproof capsule ...

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
... for the two-year cruise back to Earth.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As it approaches home, Osiris-Rex will 
jettison the sample. Gravity will do the rest.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If all goes as planned, the capsule 
will fall through the atmosphere ...

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
... open its parachute, and land in
the Utah desert on Sept. 24, 2023.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A handful of matter retrieved from
the dawn of the solar system.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Atoms, separated at birth, returned for 
study after 4.5 billion years of wandering.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Future missions might visit 
another nearby asteroid.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
A larger spacecraft with robotic arms 
and legs could straddle a 20-ton boulder ...

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
... grapple it and tow it away.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Then carry it back to orbit the moon, 
within reach of Earth and its astronauts.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Another step in understanding the birth of
our solar system and the world on which we live. 

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And perhaps, a clue to protecting 
our blue and green planet ...

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:00:00,000
... from an asteroid that may, 
one day, veer too close to home.
