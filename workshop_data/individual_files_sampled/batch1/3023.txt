I think marine lepen has a much greater chance of winning the French presidential election later this month than many people assume if she's definitely anti-eu and she's very much anti-immigration as well and I think her voters are steadfast they're committed to her they will vote for her at a much higher rate than say the supporters of any other candidate if she makes it into the second round which she will she will have a perhaps smaller core of voters than her opponent but they will be much more committed core of voters there is a susceptibility to listen to the promises of people like Donald Trump a marine lepen or Nigel Farage that by withdrawing from the world withdrawing from super national institutions by reversing globalization that they will be able to basically blunt the effects of globalization
