INTELLIGENCE TARGETS AND INFILTRATE U.S. INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO DO IT WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION, BRET. Bret: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRYING TO RALLY SENATE REPUBLICANS TO PUSH THROUGH MORE OF HIS NOMINEES. AND IF TO PUSH HARDER TOWARD HOLDING ONTO THEIR MAJORITY IN NOVEMBER. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A SEPARATE PUSH AMONG SENATORS FOR SOME KIND OF RESPONSE TO AN INSULT AGAINST ONE OF THEIR OWN. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT JOHN ROBERTS DEALS WITH THAT STORY TONIGHT FROM THE NORTH LAWN. JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO THE PRESIDENT RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE, HE HAD BEEN UP FOR THE WALTER REED MEDICAL CENTER VISITING THE FIRST LADY AS SHE RECOVERS FROM A KIDNEY PROCEDURE. EARLIER TODAY HE WAS PUSHING HIS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME TO CAPITOL HILL WITH A LOT ON HIS MIND, FIRST AND FOREMOST OF SLOW PACE OF CONFIRMATION FOR HIS NOMINEES. HE SAYS OBSTRUCTION IS STANDING IN A WAY OF GETTING A STAFF IN PLACE. EXITING THE MEETING, SENATORS PREFERRED TO FOCUS ON WHAT HAS BEEN DONE RATHER THAN WORK OUTSTANDING. WE WERE ALL IN A CELEBRATORY MOOD AS A RESULT OF HAVING APPROVED AT THE FIRST CIRCUIT JUDGE, JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER ITEMS ON HIS AGENDA TO TALK ABOUT INCLUDING APPROPRIATIONS, MAKING SURE HE DOESN'T GET MORE OMNIBUS SPENDING BILLS, FUNDING FOR A BORDER WALL AND LATEST DEVELOPMENTS FROM IRAN AND NORTH KOREA. THE PRESIDENT WILL ALSO PUSH CONGRESS FOR IMMIGRATION REFORM. THIS MORNING HE IS THE BACKDROP OF THE NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS OF MEMORIAL SERVICE TO DRIVE HOME THE URGENCY. President Trump: THAT IS WHY WE ARE CALLING ON CONGRESS TO SECURE OUR BORDERS, SUPPORT OUR BORDER AGENTS, STOP SANCTUARY CITIES AND SHUT DOWN POLICIES THAT RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINALS BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. WE DON'T WANT IT ANY LONGER. WE HAVE HAD IT. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. ONE TOPIC THAT DIDN'T COME UP EVEN THOUGH IOWA SENATOR JONI ERNST WANTED TO RAISE IT WAS THE CUTTING REMARK THAT WHITE HOUSE STAFFER KELLY SADLER MADE ABOUT SENATOR JOHN McCAIN IN A MEETING LAST WEEK. A GROWING NUMBER OF SENATORS NOW SAYING SADLER, THE WHITE HOUSE, OR BOTH SHOULD APOLOGIZE. OF THE PRISON HE SAID THAT SHOULD APOLOGIZE AND SHOULD APOLOGIZE PUBLICLY. WHITE HOUSE STAFFERS TELL FOX NEWS THAT SADLER COULD HAVE EASILY PUT THE ISSUE TO REST BY MAKING A PUBLIC APOLOGY TO McCAIN LAST WEEK. ACCORDING TO SOURCES THAT WAS INITIALLY THE PLAN, BUT THE PLAN CHANGED. SADLER DUG IN HER HEELS AND SIX DAYS LATER THE ISSUE WAS GATHERING STEAM. AND AN EFFORT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE THE INSULT OF ALL ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT WAS LEAKED. MEANING THE SO-CALLED LEAKS COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE ARE AN EXAGGERATION COMING OUT OF THE NEWS MEDIA IN ORDER TO MAKE US LOOK AS BAD AS POSSIBLE. WITH THAT SAID, LEAKERS ARE TRAITORS AND COWARDS AND WE WILL FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE. SOURCES SAY THERE WERE ABOUT 30 PEOPLE IN THE MEETING WHERE THE REMARK WAS MADE AND OFFICIALS BELIEVE IT WAS LEAKED SIMPLY TO DAMAGE THE PRESIDENT, , AND THAT THERE WILL LIKELY BE REPERCUSSIONS. I HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS ON THIS VERY TOPIC TODAY. DO YOU EXPECT PERSONNEL CHANGES AS A RESULT? I DO. KELLING AND CONWAY SAID A LOT OF STAFFERS USE LINK TO "SHIV" EACH OTHER. WHITE HOUSE HAS SET IN THE
