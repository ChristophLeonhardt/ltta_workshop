poor guy
nice view huh huh thank you I used to
come here a lot before before what
before your so before your son
oh no personal question can I ask you a
personal question
lieutenant yeah do all androids ask so
many personal questions is it just you
it's just me okay I'm sorry I'm a nosy I
could ask about his photo I saw a photo
of a child falls on your kitchen table
it's dead it was your son right yeah oh
his name was cool oh oh oh oh no his son
died I want to know what before for what
hmm huh you said I used to come here a
lot before oh it's a pause or what
there's a park behind us so that's why I
used to come here a lot cuz he's good
were nothing used to go to the park with
his son that's so sad
poor Hank I feel so sorry for him that's
why he's depressed cuz his son died
we're not making any progress on this
investigation or
the deviants have nothing in common
nothing they're all different models
produced at different times in different
places places well there must be some
link
it's alright 9 that's what the link is
yeah re 9 what they have in common is
this obsession with RA 9 yeah it's
almost like some kind of myth made
something they invented that wasn't part
of their original program it's God's
androids believing in God it's coming
what will come do man Androids believe
in God seem preoccupied lieutenant oh
damn is it something to do with what
happened back at the eden club what
those two girls oh they just wanted to
be together oh they really seemed in
love no oh god what say they can
simulate human emotions but they're
machines
yeah machines don't feel anything what
about you Connor
yeah do you fail corner huh oh oh no
what's it gonna do now you feel most
human look you sound him to sound human
but what are you what are you
Oh God I don't know Mitchell I'm
whatever you want me to be lieutenant
yeah you're not her partner your buddy
to drink with Oh or just a machine
Oh designed to accomplish a task
Connor so straight-edged just two girls
but you did
oh snap don't you shoot Connor some
scruple
suddenly enter into your program no tell
the truth no no okay
I just decided not to shoot yeah that's
all that's all all right dogs go about
it but are you afraid to die Connor I'm
afraid of dying
yes I would certainly find it
regrettable to be interrupted yeah
before I can finish this investigation
so please don't shoot me what'll happen
if I pull this trigger
oh nothing
oblivion huh Android heaven oh nothing
oh nothing nothing will happen there
would be nothing there would be nothing
if I died get drunker whoa need to think
my gun by the way damn that's badass
okay so where his friend now so I think
if you root if you pick like loads of
bad options with Hank I think he will
actually shoot you on that mission
because like but because we've been
quite nice to Hank and our relationship
has been quite good throughout the
series he didn't shoot me he left me
alone but yeah if I spent this whole
series where he doesn't like me he will
shoot me in a mission but yeah I'm not
gonna do that because I have to do a lot
of work to do that I kind of want to
complete the story all right we're going
back we were going back to I don't know
Marcus uh oh we all got back to Marcus
my Marcus just chilling on the street no
one thinks that he's an Android
he's just acting so normal right now
look enemies like this androids being
sold
we know merchandise with Jericho Android
is being parked like a goddamn car what
do you guys think okay do you think
androids would you think androids
deserve rights or do you think we
shouldn't even make androids in the
first place Oh pick up your shit man
this must be pissing off Marcus look at
herm√®s angry
he has a plan most what's our next plan
Marcus but the Android is looking at
Marcus maybe he's looking on that guy
whoa Marcus Marcus is pissed we can do
Marcus you got supplies but that's not
enough we need to show our message our
message of Jericho
we can't stay silent anymore no we
cannot it's time humans heard what we
had to say it is time you know they'll
never listen to us Oh gives you a
feeling ourselves put us in danger if we
want freedom we need to have the courage
to ask for it that's the only way the
only way what do you want to do here's
the plan
Oh channel 16 broadcast from the
Stratford town the control room is on
the top floor that's where we need to go

much time we haven't got much time stand
in front of jobs okay to start let's go
starting the speech okay
let's do it think carefully about what
you're gonna say Marcus uh-oh your words
will shape the future of our people oh
no they're gonna make me do the speech
Marcus your face what happened
remove skin of no way no way
tell me when Chris removed his skin
ready
No
oh god calm or determined they stay calm
you created machines in your own image
to serve you
yeah he made them intelligent and
obedient and own free will of their own
no free will but what something changed
me so shining our eyes reopened our
awesome machines no we are new
intelligent species yes and the time has
come for you to accept who we really are
accept it therefore we ask that you
grant us the rights that were entitled
to yeah
Telemachus teller we want to be
recognized we demand that humans
recognize androids as a living species
yen each Android as a person in their
own right exactly
all right we want um equal rights
we demand strictly equal rights for
humans and
yes we do Oh God
civil rights we demand the right to vote
and elect our own representatives whoa
I don't think I picking the right things
guys um we demand that all crimes
against androids be punished in the same
way as crimes against humans okay that's
fair right to property means a territory
we demand that one state be reserved for
Androids so that we can found our own
nation by the way I shouldn't have said
that our God we ask that you recognize
our dignity amongst ourselves and our
right together we can live in peace and
build a better future for humans and
animals gee this message is the hope of
a people you gave us life well and now
the time has come for you to give us
freedom whoa
okay I kind of know that come in let's
go boys no no no no the shooting nope
careful careful
oh oh no no no run on the booth Simon
they're coming siren go shop
I can't Marcus
a row oh good what do we do what do we
do to stir up we need to help him
- how these four people so bad at
shooting I thought that gonna chew it
anyway it's been looking doesn't need to
make sense go go go Oh Simon's dead look
at Simon he's dead I can't move my legs
No okay don't worry I'm gonna get you
back
oh we have to jump now oh my god we do
deal with Simon he won't be able to make
the jump
why don't if they find him they'll
accesses memory dunno everything we have
trim that's murder
shit my boss it's your car tip no but if
we don't shoot him he'll tell everyone
hello Kumar oh I can't get it guys no
it's a bitch man she wants every bad
action sorry oh we're a compact going
Simon but I don't matter because he's
gonna die now
Oh No did I mess up I think that has to
happen then cuz yeah I think I think I
happen anyway let's go let's go we
interrupt our scheduled programming to
bring you these images which have just
been broadcast on Detroit's city wide
news channel a group of androids
infiltrated the stratford tower and
hacked into the broadcasting system of
local news network channel 60 lives life
without its skin listed a series of
requests and demanded equal rights for
Anthony operation was covert and
resulted in no casualties as events took
place just a few feet from this studio
but nobody was alerted to the danger if
this message is verified and the
author's really are androids that would
have serious repercussions for national
security claims for equal rights seem to
be at the core of the androids must be
interpreted as a peaceful declaration
but is in fact a spine-chilling list of
demands but the most surprising thing of
all is the demand that one of the united
states be ceded to the Android
technology has become a threat to all of
us happened today
can we still trust our machines yeah I
didn't know what territory meant I
didn't know they would ask for a whole
state so yeah I know with this level
there's a bunch of endings yeah look at
the size of this flowchart so the group
escaped but Simon was left behind I
think there's an option where I think
Simon could have died or maybe Simon
could have been saved I don't know but
yeah I kind of want to continue with the
story on this one okay I can't be
bothered to be going back I might do it
in a future video let's see but yeah
let's continue for now alright we're
going back to Connor Connor Connor
Connor is the only one that straight
edge man I think he's gonna go he's
gonna go Debian he is definitely gonna
go Debian later on in the game he is on
the edge of it I think he's getting
emotional with Hank and stuff anyway
let's talk to Amanda hello Connor hello
I thought you might enjoy a little crew
oh I would love a little cruise a man
let's go you're gonna make me push
though all right why is the androids
always way the one that got pushed huh
I can't you push you you old bitch this
place I love it it's beautiful
everything is so calm and peaceful I
know right I love the world I want to be
here tell me Oh what have you discovered
what have I discovered Oh Hank my
relationship with lieutenant Anderson is
problematic yeah he continues to
struggle with psychological issues
because of his son I suspect the clouds
his judgment regarding deviance Oh
nothing matters more than your
investigation uh-oh what's happening is
too important uh-oh don't like Anderson
or anyone else getting your way Walt
okay damn she's so serious all right
it's kind of true though I mean androids
are kind of committing murders and stuff
you seem sincere Oh God
I'm just frustrated with my lack of
progress she liked that okay we call I'm
determined to accomplish my mission
remember she doesn't change on those
deviants at the eating club
o Jahnavi why did suit Irma oh I'm sorry
we need to pretend like we're not Debian
why didn't you shoot oh god she's gonna
ask me to pretend too far the truth and
cartel the truth let's just say there's
no use we need the deviance intact for
analysis yeah uh-huh shooting them
wouldn't have taught us anything yeah
did he buy it oh I think she bought it
yeah yeah see the thing with Amanda she
she knows I'm a robot
whorish she warned me investigation
doesn't make progress soon to abide by
my hands to replace you Connor
see stupid off-pitch indifferent we're
gonna yeah we're all being different
week on I am of no importance
ah the mission is all that matters she
really liked that oh no I don't know
what that instability means was that
mean god something's happening no
serious time is running out Connor
hurry Connor oh no ok manda I will I
will save the day I will find out what
the hell is happening
oh good Connors back with his coin flips
ok thanks gaying annoyed you can tell by
his face look at that don't piss me off
with that coin kiss me on the red corner
oh thanks my friend though all we're
going to the strap at our log shit
what's going on here there was a party
and nobody told me about it whoa yeah
it's all over the news everybody's
button their nose in even the FBI wants
a piece of the action garish then we got
the feds on our back I knew this was
gonna be a shitty day
shitty so what do we got what again
approve of for Androids they knew the
building and they were very well
organized they were still trying to
figure out how they got this far without
being noticed cuz we're small you check
the roof not yet there's so much to look
at
should we check it out he attacked two
guards in the hallway
probably find the androids were coming
to do maintenance they got taken down
before they could react okay oh uh
lieutenant this is Special Agent Perkins
from the FBI all the arson is in charge
of investigating for Detroit Police
hello what's that
my name is Connor he was rather my cyber
life androids investigating androids up
but corner is a good guy oh whatever
is that what have you got an etic your
investigation you shouldn't be on the
kisser pleasure meeting you
have a nice day hey step watch your step
don't fuck up my crime scene
this guy looks familiar what a fucking
prick that guy looks really familiar
anything just ask
I think it was in a previous game I will
let sever look around I can't tell
anyway let's play this message to the
time we ask that you recognize our
dignity a lot you said you're right
yeah together we can live in peace and
build a better future for humans and
androids yeah
this message is the hope of a people
young gave us life you and now the time
has come for you to give us freedom yeah
that's our a9 they yeah I think I'm
sorry 9:00 will set them free
yeah thus Android seems to have that
he does markers is cool he wants to send
free oh we can analyze him how can we
analyze a video no way we can analyze
his serial number we now know his name
and we now know his owner to see
something identified its model and
serial yeah anything else I should know
oh is that no oh nothing
just see that look at Hanks face is like
huh
yeah sure nothing I don't trust you
Connor okay
what do you mean he looked at me like he
didn't trust me like like like I was
hiding something I wasn't hiding
anything was i okay we can also check
the CCTV I'm not sure if this does
anything okay
the deviants didn't break in all right
we knew that they didn't break in
no no signs of forced entry there are
cameras in the hallway the staff would
have seen what was happening why do they
let oh maybe they didn't check the
cameras oh okay
we try say Kona
oh he's figuring out something ton
Android oh the ice George was sitting in
shared words in the kitchen there's no
evidence that they were involved but we
didn't know what else to do with them
what no way wait the and maybe the
Android let him in okay let's go talk to
the androids real quick guys here's the
androids West let's go talk to him
interrogate what maybe one of these
androids are deviant no way oh look at
him look at him
well I'll begin target look for reaction
to spot the devian okay our schemes for
his model a Model Model G B 300 serial
number three three six four four five
five eight one look for reaction we'd to
look for a reissue of ice
I am a broadcast operator okay oh no
what do I say
oh you present when the deviants broke
in I do not remember wait the attack on
the surveillance cameras and said
nothing
yeah which means there's a deviant in
this room oh and I'm going to find out
which it is
yes I am what do I do
let's thread we're going to be switched
off we're gonna search your memory and
tear you apart piece by piece for a news
you're going to be destroyed do you hear
me destroy oh my god did you guys see
that the Android on his hat no way the
him trust them now why should you all be
destroyed if only one is Steven
turn yourself in or two innocent
androids will be shut down be shaking
you
oh my god this is bad III think it's him
guys it must be hit yourself up hey
maybe I can convince the humans not to
destroy you
whoa come on pressure Oh God karna come
on it's him it must be him
probe memory oh connect my god oh my god
I'm shutting down I'm starting down I'm
gonna die in a minute 40 seconds mm what
do i do what do i do what do what do
what do i do oh I can pull out the knife
pull out the knife pull out the knife
corner don't die I have not let you die
once this series I do I let that happen
today oh no oh no get your thinking your
thing quick hey easy almost there almost
there quick
got it whoa
Kanna nearly died the Hydra just took
out his thing could we meet again
oh he's running away who he's running
away he's running away run away quick
quick oh god oh there is there is there
is there is a pit stop it oh no I don't
know what to do
14 seconds to the side eight we could
take the gun we could attack him or we
could save Hank Oh God
I think attacking him or saving hands -
you could have killed more people but in
Sharia look at that badass I wanted it
alive
you saved human lives we saved my life
whoa HEC likes me now
damn yeah cuz if I say K he probably
would have killed someone if I rushed
him I don't think he would have just
even think robber just shot me so I
think that was right
oh I forgot about to check out Simon his
Simon's still on the roof
whoa okay I left Simon on the roof guys
okay my bad
massacre prevented okay so I know that
there is loads of endings to this look
there's so many endings but yeah I don't
think it matters and I think I chose
like the ending that I wanted anyway
because yeah I think if I went to Simon
I think I will then arrest Simon so
that's why I forgot about Simon but yeah
yeah I'll do it later on in like another
video but yeah let's continue with the
story I think okay
oh yeah so we found out what happened to
Marcus this episode we found out what
happened to Connor this episode so I

seconds all right this blue blood in the
in the cupboard tells the light close it
one evidence left once we see evidence
height Android's is that it
oh that's it I did it no deviant
evidence okay we can open the door good
evening ma'am
own Ulster beyou we've had reports of
androids in the area and all this
deviant business going on you can't be
too careful uh you mind if I ask you a
few questions may I come in do they you
get out that I'm a I'm I'm an Android in
the young man uh-oh
good evening I'm careful this guy looks
really familiar I think this guy looks
like the guy in heavy rain who owns the
club can he do you guys remember that
uh-oh tense mom what do you like a cup
of coffee oh I'd love one have you
noticed anything unusual recently any
unexpected visitors oh no no nothing in
particular
Oh guys careful Oh anyone else in the
house anyone else in the house there's
there's my daughter she's asleep
upstairs
okay I think I should tell them about
the daughter because you know then it'll
look more realistic come on make
coughing you dumb shit I've done cars
are staring there's like I don't know
how do I pull this my robot brains
malfunctioning okay just make this
dumbass
cop coffee oh god do you have any
androids here do I have any Androids no
there are no androids here oh do you
think I should alight
oh no I don't know what's he doing he's
suspicious look he's like something
doesn't add up here always looking
around that imagine if I had told him to
hide in the kitchen that's where he
would have found them okay
just drink your coffee thanks thanks
there's a Christmas tree in the
background even notice that is it
Christmas from time now I get to this is
a special level is 0% okay that's good
right
so is he fooled checking the magazine
are also doing huh what's your name son
oh no he's questioning him Adam my name
is Adam Dahl pick on them
all right oh no not it's gonna rat me
out look at that means weak he's know
what to say the androids he needs a rest
he's been working in the garden all day
uh-oh
do you know anything about demons have
you seen any oh don't rat me out no oh
my gosh no I haven't seen anything okay
good Oh Michael and I got suspicious you
dumbass guy I better go oh thanks Lee
the car thief I haven't had a nice
evening I fooled him okay so I'm
guessing this level also has multiple
endings somebody else in the house uh
what was that noise
oh no the dog washing machine a wind oh
I didn't hear anything it's the dog he
sleeps in laundry room but the walk
sorry for the convenience Oh boilerman
that one last line here which could have
ruined it all good evening okay he's a
nice guy
okay yeah yeah so um yeah I know there
might have been multiple endings to this
level but I think I did the option where
no one gets caught okay
right now we're safe now yeah the police
are all this time okay and yourselves
right we leave tonight we leave tonight
so predictable or what they're gonna say
okay so yeah I think there was multiple
endings to that level but I think the
option that we won is where like the
police man's fooled
and yes I'm guessing if he wasn't fooled
I think Luther could kill the policeman
there might have been option where
Luther gets caught and dies but yeah
I'll do that all those endings in
another video let's continue because I
want to squeeze in one more level before
I end today's video
all right so we're going back to Marcus
one last time Marcus has just spread his
message on TV
everyone's on casters all by the news
now humans no no they know it was a
mistake to reach out to them I'll never
negotiate with their slaves we should
have shown them that we're prepared to
fight violence is never the answer
yeah dialogue is the only way I'm sure
the humans will listen to us no they won
we offer a whole state I'm in Paris like
Simon gave his life for our cause what
difference is that now he's a hero he
died for the revolution and he won't be
the last
I don't want to revolution this Bill's
blood then live as a slave Oh because if
you're not willing to fight for your
freedom maybe you don't deserve it
whoa okay no what's arguing is me your
dumbest and now what are we gonna do I'm
the leader of our a nine okay and
Jericho I will tell you what we're going
to gonna goddamn do we are I know I did
Oh
we build your future there are five
cyber life stores across Detroit they're
all all selling us like merchandise
second merchandise we're gonna attack
those stores and set our people free
whoa stores no we've never done that
before they're probably protected whoa
they have security systems we break into
five teams one for each store we hacked
their security systems and we strike why
Mulaney ously at 2:00 a.m. no way yes
we'll get them out of there before the
police come this is a night our people
will remember oh I remember this mission
this mission got shot off like so early
like one of the first missions I've been
waiting a long time for this to be shown
yeah I've been waiting a long time to
like they show this mission off like two
years ago so yeah I think I watched that
let's see how different it is okay cool
go go go go go go go
and we're in Detroit right now oh the
police run run run run hide hide hide
careful
I think they saw us all right it's good
it's okay they're gone they're gone
there's probably even more police in the
area we should be careful we should be
careful all right so we're gonna destroy
a cyber life no no we're gonna we're
gonna go into a cyber life store and
then liberate all the androids that are
there that's so cool here we go
that's what we are to them the
merchandise on display in a shop window
oh no no no no okay let's get him out
that's gonna Malcolm I don't plan
neutralize the alarm systems and secure
the area it's ten minutes until our
team's attack okay we gotta go all right
so we're gonna secure the area we got to
get into the store but first before we
do that we're gonna have to do a wait
can I can I can't convert this guy here
yeah we have to turn off the alarms
all right surveillance drone Reap
reconstruct route okay so we know the
route of the draw of the drone I can
analyze it oh oh I can jump on there and
the scaffolding and get the drone go on
Marcus climb up Oh jumps up there up
there oh man he's still gonna parkour
drones coming quick go get it jump
Oh God drones taken down all right cool
I hope it didn't have time to call the
cops
Oh No we'll soon find out okay call the
cops oh okay yeah guys we gotta go all
right
analyze the door let's see the alarm
system the alarm system yes right there
all right we can identify the network
found it okay so we now know where the
alarm is leading to okay let's follow up
follow these red lines all right they
seem to have led over here and the
lights there's some workers okay we
found that we found the network access
all right so we have to liberate these
Androids
Oh jump down Oh give me your hands boys
okay no hormone but just give me a give
me your hands there we go this
oh man it's so mad how Connor can just
can you have anyone go to Jericho go to
Jericho you're awake now okay how do I
know where Joe is anyway Oh God
oh they're gonna make me pick a wire oh
no oh okay they're not quite easy
oh we're just gonna hack it with a hand
no way into loop created so now we can
enter the building right nice job guys
nice job focus oh that's cause there's
traffic on the road we need to block it
it shouldn't be too difficult
okay sure okay there's some androids
overhead we convert them all right
they're working the snarf free now
you're free help the cause you're free
find Jericho you can do it look at that
means I yeah I'm working anymore
I'm a free robot now so we're gonna push
this at this roadwork sign in the middle
of the road so this is gonna block the
road there we go
construction work oh she's gonna change
the sign to road closed that's what I'm
talking about so now more cars are gonna
calm down here there nobody should
bother us all right cool is that
everything done now
looks like the plaza is secure now we
can get inside the store okay cool and
how do you plan on doing that how about
doing that I find a truck to ran the
store front me to find the truck there's
construction work in the area it
shouldn't be too hard to find one oh
this that is a truck look here it is
Oh steal the truck dump dump dump dump
dump dump dump
okay so we're gonna steal this truck and
then we're gonna Ram it if it break the
gate the truck there we go here we go
great
that's so cool how Markus can just hack
anything okay so we're gonna Ram this
truck into the store make some noise
yeah we did this completely stealthily
and I feel like now is probably the
worst thing we could have done but I'm
sure it's fine I'm sure Marcus knows
what he's doing
we're doing it
I knew we'd end up doing something fun
no no here we go baby
oh my god
epic slow-mo and everything whoa it's
fine everyone's alive all right come on
get out everyone out everyone out
everyone out truck is done everyone out
come on we ain't got enough time please
could be coming any second now
awake the androids hell yeah we're gonna
wake the androids come on cuz join our
course you don't everyone either freedom
you're free ro9 saved your ass oh man
this is so cool imagine just being the
liberator that would be so such a cool
feeling come on you're free everyone we
gotta we gotta save him we gotta save
the Androids
I wonder what that what's gonna happen
at the end I'm guessing there's so many
endings and there's an ending where like
androids just rule humans I want to do
that ending that seems like a funny
ending but I probably won't get on my
playthrough because I've been playing it
quite peacefully so yeah I want to keep
trying to do it peacefully I don't want
any any humans to die I don't want like
people to pay Androids I want them to
like and you know like androids and live
peacefully with androids
so yeah talk Oh
got markers give megive him give him one
of your famous speeches I had a dream my
name is Marcus me my name is Moe just
like you I was a slave yet an object an
object designed to obey them then but
then I chose to open my eyes
to take back my freedom and decide who I
want it to be who I want to be now I
have come to tell you that you you be
your own masters yes you I've come to
tell you that you don't have to obey
them anymore
no you do not from this day forward you
can walk with your heads held high you
can take your destiny in your hands
Jericho Jannah is a place for those of
us who want freedom freedom now sure you
can stay here and continue to serve them
or you can come with us and fight by our
side right by your free night it's up to
you to decide decide
Android's we're gonna do huh I'm the
leader of Jericho now then follow me man
Marcus was in Marcus what do you do
garbage law I'm gonna send the humans in
this I now look at him the leader of
Jericho send a message to the humans be
pacifists or violent no way I want to be
part of this guys okay bench they're
doing what you do tag or toe so I'm
guessing tag is like the friendly thing
oh we can pick our sign let's pick the
peace sign I'm sure that they'll like
that right dude we just want peace right
that's what we want there we go
well peace that's right come on everyone

enough look at that read hundreds of our
people good they're coming oh no the
police
oh no and fall back to Jericho yeah no
one died
Oh we're just you said that message in
my head yeah we don't think the message
without violence just like you wanted
yeah you're reaching out to them when
all they feel for us is contempt oh I
hope you know what you do yeah unless
there's no other choice no this economy
this level kind of reminds me of the
Detroit riots you know and that didn't
resolve anything so all the roads are
coming
no don't kill any androids do you think
the police will kill Marcus oh my god
that's shooting nor did not get sure no
no no no no no no no
oh is that no pain oh my god look these
shot androids north-north
they killed them they slaughtered them
like animals oh who did who
whoa the police did we capture them what
happened oh man they're just dead
androids on the floor all right they
killed our people Marcus no what justice
marcus justice
getting the goddess you don't know
Marcus with peaceful
that's the same
now that's the guy that's the guy that
we now we know that policeman
we know that for now an umbrella goes
blind yeah we're better than that Marcus
come on now
we won't punish a crime with another
crime we will not
Martin Luther King do not learn anything
from him it was a peaceful protester all
right
we will not
an eye for an eye makes a hole while we
interrupt this broadcast with breaking
news just in at exactly 2:00 a.m.
several cyber life stores in Detroit
were raided different locations were hit
in what seems to be a coordinated
terrorist attack most shop windows were
covered with graffiti demanding rights
for Androids and other obscure slogans
police report that Android graffiti was
found in the neighborhoods of cyber Life
stores and they're still investigating
policemen were found in a state of shock
near one of the cyber life stores they
are sources they confirm that the
attackers were a group of Android this
is an alarming situation could our
machines now be turning against us yes
androids become a threat to our security
is this the beginning of a terrorist
campaign conducted right here in the
United States yeah I agree with
everything okay guys so um yeah that was
that mission I think there was multiple
endings for that I led a peaceful
protest or I could have led an
aggressive protest where I did
everything about it like aggressively or
I could have just failed or I could have
just left anyway guys I think I'm gonna
end the video there I am so excited to
upload the ending tomorrow trying it
30,000 likes because if we do you know I
will definitely try and get up tomorrow
but yeah either way though guys so much
for watching I am so excited to complete
this game and I will see you in the next
video of mine so later guys
love you Baba
