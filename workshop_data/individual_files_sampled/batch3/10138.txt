European elites prefer to overlook the fact that back then there was no one in Europe who could actually fight back against fascism the governments of some countries indoors titler while for the others it was a matter of days before their capitulated France lasted forty three days Poland 36 Greece 24 Norway 24 Belgium a team Yugoslavia 11 the Netherlands 5 Albania 3 Denmark 1 and Czechoslovakia surrendered without a fight the USSR fought on for 4 years neither the Soviet authorities nor the people ever dreamt about leaving their country at the mercy of fascists that's why all over Europe there are millions of graves of Soviet soldiers and this is how former US Secretary of Defense William Perry assesses the situation on the eastern front back then the brunt of this suffering was borne by the Soviet Union almost half of the deaths in World War two were suffered by the Soviet Union both in the Red Army and among the civilian population and they played a decisive role in the finally final victory over Nazi Germany this is something that I recognize this opinion is shared by those who took part in the fights retired American army colonel and World War two veteran frankoc fought with the T force field reconnaissance group at the Elbe we of course never saw the Russian soldiers fighting but we had many reports about it and we understood that they were very aggressive and they did a very good job and they moved all the way through through Russia through Poland and into Germany we were very lucky because the infantry went first and then we came afterwards the Europe prefers to ignore the fact that along with Nazi Germany war against the Soviet Union was officially declared by the governments of Italy Finland Slovakia Bulgaria hungaria

listeners on Ferrante nuka-cola some Western historians claim that the successes of the Red Army was certainly due to American supplies made possible by the so called lend-lease policy Russia then the Soviet Union carried the major weight of that battle in terms of soldiers supplied the army fighting the Germans in terms of soldiers killed in battle in terms of civilians killed in battle but still together we prevailed over the Nazi Germany George herring an American historian knows the history of lend-lease very well he's written a number of books about it it was not an act of charity or generosity it was an act of calculated self-interest lend-lease turned out to be a profitable business for the US few people know that it took until 2006 for the Russian Federation to repay the u.s. fully for the loan in fact more than 60% of lend-lease supplies went to Great Britain and just 20% of the USSR the majority of deliveries were made between 1944 and 1945 when the outcome of the war had practically been determined did the United States benefit from it and I think you could say yes absolutely the United States did did benefit from the war in in some ways world war ii cures the depression as far as the United States is concerned prosperity is for short goods restore even after the u.s. joined the war American corporations continue to fulfill orders to enemy countries

extermination of millions became NATO generals the CIA hired thousands of SS officers and scientists there's a reason why Operation Paperclip was launched right after World War 2 you've got 1,600 Nazi scientists to the US you know and and those people were incorporated into the NSA and those people were you know we're used for the Manhattan Project and use for all kinds of nefarious things and some of these people so you know it's basically the idea that that we defeated fascism is just false what we did is we sort of merged into fascism and took it over and you know so that's really where it's at so again young people are confused as because they're lied to every day in addition to war criminals political scientists historians ideologists who had worked on Hitler's propaganda as well as

American Cyril professor general of Vienna Phoenix shivers arbitrarily a tortilla yabuta she will myths about the Soviet threat and a preventive German strike on the USSR and nothing new they were developed inside the Third Reich this justification was expressed on June the 22nd 1941 by the German ambassador Schulenburg in a message passed to the Soviet government and in a memorandum presented to the Soviet ambassador in Berlin on the same day the document stated that the USSR was allegedly preparing to invade Europe and that this was the main cause of war in the meantime German planes were already bombing Soviet cities cheated on Ariana Lee Bo na budu terrible touch Lana's rebo possibly mokuba votes buttons are provide certain blow on a personal force the preventative strike myth was completely dispelled at the Nuremberg trials former head of the German press and radio preacher admitted that the propaganda campaign had been planned in order to convince the public that the USSR and not Germany was to blame for the war these myths when later adopted by proponents of the Cold War historical rewrite ever since World War two and it was necessary to foment the cold war against Russia against communism and socialism that's where attempts to justify the Third Reich come from to make it look like the victim of Soviet aggression then another idea was introduced that the main driving
