REPUBLICAN REPORT ON WHETHER HIS CAMPAIGN COLLUDED WITH RUSSIA TO WIN THE ELECTION. JOHN ROBERTS COVERING IT ALL. IT LOOKED LIKE A WATERSHED MOMENT. THE LEADERS OF NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA SMILING AND LAUGHING AND EMBASING. EMBRACING. COULD THEN JUST ANOTHER NORTH KOREA DECEPTION? PRESIDENT TRUMP BEGAN HIS DAY WITH THE U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM. A SEGUE TO TALK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BREAK THROUGH ON NORTH KOREA. I WANT TO EXPRESS MY HOPE THAT ALL OF THE PEOPLE FROM NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA CAN LIVE IN HARMONY, PROSPERITY AND PEACE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD HAPPEN. BUT THE U.S. HEARD TALK OF CONCESSIONS BEFORE ONLY TO GET PLAYED BY NORTH KOREA. MEETING WITH ANGELA MERKEL TODAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THIS TIME FEELS DIFFERENT. IT'S NEVER GONE THIS FAR. I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER HAD THIS ENTHUSIASM FOR THEM WANTING TO MAKE A DEAL. THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN PLAYED LIKE A FIDDLE. YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF LEADER. WE WON'T BE PLAYED. OKAY. WE WILL HOPEFULLY MAKE A DEAL. IF WE DON'T, THAT'S FINE. PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THE LIST OF POSSIBLE LOCATIONS FOR A SUMMIT HAS BEEN NARROWED DOWN TO TWO. THE PRESIDENT MAKING IT CLEAR UNTIL HE SEES CONCRETE ACTIONS FROM KIM, SANCTIONS WILL REMAIN. WE WON'T REPEAT THE MISTAKE OF PAST ADMINISTRATIONS. MAXIMUM PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE UNTIL DENUCLEARIZATION OCCURS. IN THE OVAL OFFICE, PRESIDENT TRUMP WEIGHING IN TODAY ON THE FINAL REPUBLICAN REPORT FROM THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. MAJOR FINDING: NONE OF THE INTERVIEWED WITNESSES PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR CONSPIRACY BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT. THE REPORT WAS VERY POWERFUL AND STRONG. NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE. AS I SAID MANY TIMES BEFORE, I SAID THERE WAS NO COLLUSION. WE SHOULD GET ON WITH OUR LIVES AND GET ON WITH A LOT OF THINGS. DEMOCRATS CALLED IT A RUSHED JOB ONLY MEANT TO DEFLECT ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. THAT'S A KINDERGARTEN REPORT. THE REPORT CITED ILL-ADVISED CONTACT WITH WIKI LEAKS BY TRUMP ASSOCIATES AND HIGHLIGHTED THE JUNE 6th MEETING DONALD TRUMP WITH A GOVERNMENT INFORMANT FOR RUSSIAIA. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OF HER CONTACTS WITHIN THE RUSSIA GOVERNMENT THIS IS SOMEONE WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE KREMLIN. THE PRESIDENT'S MEETING WITH ANGELA MERKEL AVOIDED UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENTS. MERKEL INDICATED THAT GERMANY IS OPENED TO REDUCING ITS TRADE SURPLUS AND THE U.S. AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL IS NOT PERFECT. MORE ACTIONS NEEDED. THIS AGREEMENT IS ANYTHING BUT PERFECT. IT'S ONE PIECE OF THE MOSAIC, A BUILDING BLOCK TO BUILD-UP THIS STRUCTURE. THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT RESIST TAKING ANOTHER SHOT AT JAMES COMEY. ZEROING IN ON HIS INTERVIEW WITH BRET BAIER LAST NIGHT. DID YOU LEAK OTHER THINGS? YES. I DON'T CONSIDER WHAT I DID A LEAK. I TOLD HIM ABOUT AN UNCLASSIFIED CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDENT. YOU SAID I DON'T DO SNEAKY THINGS OR DO WEASEL MOVES. WE COULD ARGUE WHAT A LEAK IS BUT THAT'S A LEAK. PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED JAMES COMEY CAN'T DEFINE WHAT A LEAK IS. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID OR HOW SERIOUS IT IS. LIEED TO COVER IT UP. HE IS EITHER VERY SICK OR VERY DUMB. PRESIDENT TRUMP'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN WON A VICTORY TODAY. A 90 DELAY IN THE STORMY DANIELS CIVIL SUIT. HER ATTORNEY WILL APPEAL THE
