yet more smiles and chuckles from a nation that's increasingly embracing a hardcore interpretation of the religion of peace with few exceptions men and women can no longer dine together in a region of Indonesia as Sharia law is further implemented well this just in from the Daily Mail a strict Islamic district in Indonesia has now been men and women from dining together unless they're either married or related and why would that be you ask well it's to make sure the females are quote more obedient and well behaved end quote no no we're not talking about female dogs going to obedience school mind you we're talking human females you know it must be such a joy being a female living in an Islamic Republic was strictly enforce Sharia law and so it is that the no-fun fundamentalists running Indonesia is deeply Islamic at a province well they say that it's times up for guys and gals grabbing lunch together in a way it's understandable I suppose I mean if you're going to allow unmarried couples to eat together in public what other brazen immorality awaits I mean what if they start holding hands or gasp hugging I mean the next thing you know you're practically living in Sodom and Gomorrah right but hang on I think we have some reaction from the feminists in the West here goes surely some mistake that sounded like a whole lot of nothing oh well maybe the feminists are too busy organizing awareness campaigns to change the name of men whole two-person whole or cultural sensitivity this being the protected species that is Islam go figure in any event the new sex segregated dining rule is reportedly the latest wild and crazy' Sharia implementation in Indonesia and these mullahs mean business let me tell you you break an etiquette rule in these parts well trust me folks you don't want to break any rules in these parts because that means getting publicly whipped if you're found guilty of say gambling or having a beer or being homosexual holy heartbreak that last one can't be true well indeed it is and there have been some dire consequences for example a recent Time magazine article notes that HIV rates among gay men in Indonesia have increased fivefold from 5% in 2007 to 25% in 2015 outreach workers and human rights observers note that without access to education and other services the HIV epidemic among gay Indonesia men will only get increasingly worse especially in major urban centres sadly if you're gay in Indonesia's akshay Province these days you'd best stay in the closet the do rigueur punishment if one is outed involves a public flogging typically consisting of some 87 lashes by the way check out this photo of a morality cop during the caning wow what a costume but I thought Halloween was forbidden under Sharia law - oh well in any event let's check in with the spokes thingies at the LGG BD t TT iqq aap P and sometimes white community to see what they have to say don't want to come across as being Islamophobic after all because surely there can be nothing worse than that indeed you may recall how last September Canada's Ministry of propaganda oops I'm sorry I mean Canada state broadcaster the CBC ran a story that actually defended Sharia law the headline even stated that Sharia is quote not to be feared end quote the article went on to quote a liberal MP and several spiritual leaders who defended the anti-free speech motion m103 and explained how sharia is already in canada and that it only governs religious practices and that it only applies to people inside the Muslim community this apologist piece even included a quote from a Sharia advocate saying that those who oppose m103 and those who fear sharia law are motivated by quote bigotry plain and simple end quote so in the final analysis sexism and homophobia is bad unless sexism and homophobia is be carried out in the name of Allah in which case it's good and if you don't think it's okay then you are the one with the problem because you are obviously a bigot or a racist or an islamaphobe complicated isn't it for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks the Breville has a new app please download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
