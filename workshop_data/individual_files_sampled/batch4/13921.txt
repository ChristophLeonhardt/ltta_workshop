you know a lot of conservatives don't like modern movies they feel Hollywood has become a cesspool of decadent weasels churning out poisonous leftist propaganda while raking in millions of dollars from an audience they basically despise but this of course is totally unfair to weasels instead of going to the movies many conservatives prefer to stay home and watch old Doris Day films on TV conservatives like Doris Day films because they remind them of the days when women were happy virginal housewives back in 1950 never but perhaps conservatives could learn something by studying how leftists used the cinema remember the film men in black in which an evil alien devoured the insides of a human being and then wore the human skin as a disguise that's pretty much how the Left treats respected institutions whether it's Yale University or the New York Times leftists enter the institution either way its inner values replace those values with leftism and then walk around wearing the institution as a disguise saying things like look I'm an Ivy League university or look I'm the newspaper of record when they're really just left ISM wearing an empty Yale suit or a New York Times costume so - it is with movies left diss love nothing better than to take over a beloved film franchise that built its reputation on solid values destroy those values from within and then disguise their leftism in the franchise James Bond for instance was once a daring agent who spread Western values to foreign climes and fought against the evils of communism but in Quantum of Solace written by lefty message guy Paul Haggis bond became a guy who fought the spread of Western values and supported communism he had become leftism disguised as the great James Bond likewise Walt Disney became a mega studio by making animated films that showcase beautiful princesses with traditional ideas of love and marriage but bitter feminists have transformed the Disney princess into an angry weaponized action character destined to end her life in the animated home for only old cartoons the home is in New Jersey by the way for those of you who'd like to visit Merida from brave now in keeping with its policy of polluting whatever decent people love Disney has announced that its new live-action film Beauty and the Beast starring smoking-hot cutie pie Emma what's-her-name will be a quote feminist fairy tale containing a quote exclusively gay moment in which Lefou tries to kiss Gaston now I know many Hollywood filmmakers are very busy rushing from their mistress's house to pick their kid up from rehab and bring him home to their third wife before they hurry off to a party in Encino where they'll sleep with underage boys so it's nice of them to pause once in a while to explain to our children how they should run their sex lives so I know I'm really eager to see the new Beauty and the Beast when it opens and to hear all about Hollywood's great sexual values unfortunately I'll be home that day watching Doris Day movies on TV trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show it's the Andrew Clavin show where we have transformed our own cultural correspondent Michael Knowles into a monster I think it is now time for us to get together put on our Tyrolean hats grab some torches and chase Michael Knowles to the old mill when we destroy him until the sequel return close his reasons to vote for Democrats a completely empty book a book with no words and it is now number one on Amazon and here's the thing if you go on Amazon and buy reasons to vote for Democrats this empty book you must you must buy my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ and anyone of been Shapiro's books as well you can vet buy any one you want or you go to hell I just it's a it's a theological point why did you put an empty book on the bestseller list you must buy decent books or you're done so we're gonna talk about Logan tonight today there will be no spoilers I do not spoil things but it really is a fantastic film and set a lot just to start with politics we're gonna get to Logan afterwards but we have to start and just talk also this week I mean so much is going on this week the the stuff about Russia and tweets and Trump's tweets about being spied on on all that stuff we're just all falling apart for the left as far as I'm concerned because now they're saying no he was never under investigation so then there's no Russian story you know either way they go they blow themselves up but I do want to talk this was the week that the health care bill this is the signature bill most of the Republicans ran on and it's out there and I just heard somebody it's so rare that somebody in the media and in politics says something adult and true that and it's no surprise that it was representative Louie Gohmert who is might I think he must be my favorite person in Washington Louie is he first of all he's a wonderful like a non you know pretentious guy but he is a solid conservative who never backs down and he always says what he says with a great deal of humor and you know easygoing he's from Texas razy going kind of Texas charm so they've got this bill and of course the left is just like oh this is going to destroy people will die in the streets and they keep lying about the fact you know the all the insurers are pulling out of Obamacare so soon Obamacare will just be this she'll there'll be nobody there and the prices will be incredible and there'll be no health care no health insurance and yet the the Democrats are saying you can't replace this because it's a wreck but it's our wreck so you didn't have to leave it there so they've got to replace it the Republicans ran on repeal and replace and by the way just just to be frank you know repeal doesn't really mean anything because if you pass another law the the modern law replaces the old law so the repeal thing is kind of for show but like okay there it is and they bring out this thing and it's got some entitlements and it it's gonna keep some things that you know it I I actually am not sure that it's take on Medicaid which is to send out block grants to the states I'm not sure that's a bad thing and it's it's still early it's hard to get in as a complicated bill it's hard to get it all done so Gohmert now they go into this thing what's called markup which is that where they change the bill entirely they rewrite the Builder amendments and the amendments to totally change the bill louie gohmert Gohmert had this to say about so there are things that have to be done that have to be included but we got a starting point and I think omits the horse excrement we can find a pony around here somewhere and that's what we're going to be looking to have I think we'll have a race horse as long as we get a good amendments when we're done I love that you know it's an old joke you know what is an optimist is the little kid who claps her hands when she sees a pile of horse manure because she knows there's a pony around here somewhere and he's saying it's in there and they're gonna find it the thing is you and I and our emotions and our principles and our anger and our happiness is what they these guys use to negotiate with it's all about negotiation and Trump has sold himself to us as a great negotiator so he's gonna go in there and hopefully get some kind of version of the bill he wants because if the bill fails Trump fails and this is the thing that people don't understand if the fales Trump he's gonna have a hard time getting future bills through and and the Republicans are gonna scatter and split and divide and they're gonna lose in the midterms okay so that's what's at stake you know let alone them the fixing the health care thing that's what's at stake and what Paul Ryan understands and I know a lot of conservatives don't like Ryan I'm actually kind of fond of him because I think he's done some some brave things that he you know you don't get credit in the house because you're always compromising so people who are sitting at home and never have to compromise because they're living in their own imaginations are like oh you know he'd come if I were there I would well you know he's hurting cats he's got it he's got to get something that goes through so Ryan went on Tucker Carlson and he said something that was really clever that most of these guys over I think it's over 60% of the people in the House of Representatives the Republicans in the House of Representatives had never been a governing coalition so he listened to Ryan here's here's what we did a year ago a year ago House Republicans said we need to take a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare to the country we spent a year working on this plan all House Republicans participated in this we had these working groups where anybody who had an idea brought it to the table right and then we reached consensus as conservatives as Republicans on what that plan looked like we called it a better way we put it on the internet we all ran for Congress in 2016 on that plan remember it was modeled on the Tom Price legislation that's what this is this is the legislative text of that plan that we ran in 2016 on what we would replace Obamacare with Tom Price who is now the Secretary of HHS was the architect of it twelve freedom caucus members were the co-sponsor of that bill as recently as December so we are going through what I would call the sort of typical growing pains from being an opposition party fighting Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to a governing party and now we're translating that legislation that that plan into a bill so you know what he's saying is up until now Republicans 60 I think it is 60% of the house have never had to take responsibility for the things they do because when you pass laws laws have consequences and consequences those consequences play out in the elections in the midterms so you know here's Jim Jordan who's part of the Freedom Coalition these are the guys the freedom caucus these are the guys who are opposing the bill from the right they're calling it Obamacare light and they're saying oh well we repealed it all these times why don't we just repeal it now and Jordan is one of these guys I think who came in in 2009 so he has never had to govern before and now he does and listen to what he's saying and and I know a lot of people will approve of this a lot of people on the writer will hear this go yeah yeah yeah but here I'm out so let's do this right and more importantly let's do what we told the voters we're gonna do that's why today I'll be introducing legislation which just says clean repeal let's vote on the exact same thing 15 months ago every single Republican in the house every single Republican in the Senate voted on we put it on President Obama's desk of course he vetoed it but let's put that same legislation on president Trump's desk and then work on the replacement model that will actually bring down that cost of insurance I don't think the plan the introduced yesterday is gonna bring down the cost for working-class and middle-class families okay now first two points methods first everything is poker right everything is negotiation this guy's taking a position he knows that he has you know some power he has a caucus and your anger your anger that you feel about this then we're going yeah Jim you know let's just repeal it that's those are his cards those are his cars those are the cards he brings to the table he's bringing your anger and your principles to the table but theoretically if he's a smart guy and I think he is if he's a smart guy he knows he's gonna lose he's gonna compromise he's gonna get some stuff he's not gonna get some stuff if he's not a smart guy then he's serious okay because if they bring if they brought a bill to just repeal Obamacare what would happen is Obamacare which is collapsing would collapse a lot faster it would just collapse entirely and all the people who got insurance or got on Medicaid and Obamacare would suddenly be without insurance without health care and you'd have daily reports minute by minute reports of each child who is dying of some disease that he can't get treatment for because the Republicans left him without a safety net that is what would happen the Obamacare was passed in 2009 the world in which Obamacare's best no longer exists right they can't step in the same river twice eight years ago it was a different market a different market place different healthcare system Obamacare change that it did change it so now these guys have to react to what is there and so you can't just repeal it because there's there's nothing else there there's no net to catch the people that it actually brought in those people have been screwed in a lot of ways Obama made sure that you had to buy what Obamacare does is it make sure that you have to buy expensive insurance to pay for the insurance of poor people right so that in other words your insurance now you're a male and suddenly your insurance is you know covers ob/gyn care or something like this it's this Cadillac plan that you don't want and you don't need but at the same time you're the part what's called a deductible is so high that it's like having no insurance at all unless your daughter goes to buy birth control then she gets it for free you know it's like it's in the same system just an insane leftist hodgepodge of a system that wasn't meant to work it was meant to collapse but you know if the Republicans do what Jordan wants to do in repeal and don't have a replacement and they ran on repeal and replace there won't be Republicans in there in two years that's not who will run the you know Republican that's not who will run the Congress and what we're looking for is we're looking for like president Mike Pence like eight years from now that's you know we're like I had so you've gotta govern you got to do the things you got to compromise I know it makes everybody angry but you gotta do it here's what it looks like when you don't do it okay I gotta play this before we start talking about Logan Elizabeth Warren darling of the left right is on Stephanie ruhle shows MSNBC yeah let me just play the introduction I want to play the introduction that rule gives her it is this worshipful introduction of Elizabeth Warren so let's start with that my next guest hasn't been a public thorn in the side of Republicans for quite some time it came to a head when she faced off with Mitch McConnell over a speech on the Senate floor in February McConnell's complained about the incident became a rallying cry for women and Democrats when he said that Senator Warren had been warned to stop but quote nevertheless she persisted ok nevertheless not became a slogan this Twitter hash guy tag nevertheless she persisted what a hero she is so she's given her the full hero's welcome rolling out the red carpet and Elizabeth Warren uses her moment to now say send out the leftists line you know Washington is all about the fat cats and all Trump and his millionaire friends all they're doing is helping the fat cats never in mind that more middle-class jobs were created in February twice as many middle-class jobs as anybody thought there would be never mind all that but that's that she's gonna sell the leftist line and listen to it Stephanie ruhle this worshipful interviewer asked the policies here are for the billionaire's they're for the bankers they're for the giant corporations they get the tax breaks they get the regulatory boosts they get the great deals in Washington and regular families just people who are trying to put it together day by day by day they're the ones who get left behind but senator mu you guys were in power for the last eight years why is it that it didn't work for those good Americans you know working for well let's be clear about what it means to be in power the Republicans had a blocking position yeah that's all the Republicans fault you know and for two years the Republicans had no zero position and we got Obamacare which is collapsing okay so just while you're yelling at guys like Paul Ryan who is a cat Wrangler I understand he's gonna make some compromises while you're yelling at those guys just remember these guys have to think about the future if they're not in power they can't do anything and they'll wind up on fox news with sean hannity asking them exactly that question you were in power why didn't you get it done so they've got to do something I know I know that is not the purest of the pure I know it's not you know the uncompromising conservatism that you can operate in your own mind or on the comments section of a blog but that's the reality that they're dealing with in the house so just as you watch it remember you're watching a poker game and there's gonna be some compromises and horse-trading to mix a metaphor although we could we have at our poker games we have horse trading right that's okay we're gonna talk about Logan and a lot of movies and what the movies mean but you got to come over to the daily wire.com to hear it while you're there you can subscribe for a lousy eight bucks a month you get the movie or royo and you get to be in the mail bag boy there was a great mailbag I you know that was it it was really a fun mail bag yesterday and the people who you know want to be condemning throwing their Bibles of people always angry all right come on over to the Daily wire calm
