joining us now here in New York Democratic mayor of the great city of New Orleans and the president of the US Conference of Mayors Mitch Landrieu he's the author of the new book in the shadow of statues a white southerner confronts history mr. mayor it's good to see you great to see you too so we were just talking about the speech you made that had so many people talking but viewed millions of times on YouTube about the decision to take down some of this Confederate statues that were a part of New Orleans history have you been surprised by the reaction not just in your city but nationally to you the words you spoke that day complete and totally you know the speech I gave was really to make a historic record really for the files of New Orleans to tell people why we did what we did and what it was that we were trying to do so I was as surprised as anybody that the speech went viral which says really something about not the speech but this subject matter and it's something that people are really interested in so I wrote this book is really a book for everybody especially for white folks who feel threatened by the terms of black lives matter or know they hear no justice no peace as a threat to really help them work through that there's no threat at all and that we've better together diversity is a strength not a weakness and and why these monuments were part of a much larger cause to make people who usually we work with and who our neighbors feel less than and not welcome in the city you know much better than I but I did live in the South for many years of my life the tension that exists with the history of the South done there there's a lot of pride about it and rightfully so and then there's a lot that's got to be reckoned with how do you in your mind balance those two well first of all I'm obviously a white and I'm from the south I love the south we are a place of faith family and country we love the outdoors we we have a lot of things that are really beautiful but I don't think it's deniable that after slavery five million African Americans left the south I mean that amount of human capital and human potential that has now manifests itself and people like Wendt Marcellus Louis Armstrong great doctors lawyers how much we have lost because we have not been able to come together and by the way this is not only a southern problem and that's one of the things that's one of the reasons well we have a chip on our shoulder yeah because this is something that the nation feels and and the nation practices from time to time so it really is an open invitation it's not a condemnation about how we can think differently about this and why it's important for to come together and how and how much poorly we are when we know so the speech the theme of the speech the underlying theme in the speech is reconciliation correct and why is it that I mean you're engaged in nearly on an everyday basis in New Orleans your job as mayor but why is it I mean there's a lot going on as we all know but the theme of reconciliation why don't more public people on a national stage speak to this more often well I think it's hard for all of us as human beings to say I'm sorry and it's equally hard as to say I forgive you and we're just not good at it and especially when you tried to do that as a country Germany's tried to reconcile that past by being more forthright about it South Africa's tried a little bit we in the South though have never really walked through this issue and as I say in the book you can't go around race you can't go under you have to go through it and we have been walking through it I mean since the beginning of our time so I thought it was really important to come out of a white mouth that the Confederacy was on the wrong side of history they fought to destroy the United States of America not to unite and they did it over the cause of slavery so that people could hear that say okay well look thank you for the acknowledgement now can we move to the next thing the other problem though is that sometimes white people hear this accusation of white privilege as an assault so if you if you're in the oil patch and you're humping every day trying to work trying to put your family through and you lose your job and then somebody says well you're better than me they go we'll look I'm stuck out here as well and now you guys know this politically that from 1970 through today they've tried to separate white working-class people from African American working-class people what we've been trying to do is say look your interest or common they're united don't be pulled apart so you've got 48 days left as the mayor of the city of New Orleans County a lot of people watch your speech they watch the way you've conducted yourself in the city of New Orleans and thought about higher office for you I'm curious about how you see the country right now particularly in the last 14 months or so under President Trump does it feel like where you live in New Orleans that were as divided as we've ever I think my response is gonna surprise you we see the dysfunction in Washington and everything that you guys talk about and how they can't even get in the same room and get on the same page to figure out immigration or infrastructure and we think I don't know what they're talking about in cities across America you've been in New Orleans thousands of people of different races creeds colors religion or Street all the time eating at restaurants having barbecues going to their kids games and there's this kind of weird you know disconnect that's going on from Washington and the rest of the world I recognize that we are divided on hot-button issues but I see people coming together all the time and this is what mayors of America have said we don't get to govern ideologically we have to fix problems and we have to resolve conflict and I just think in this country we have to face the fact that we don't resolve conflict well and I think that's why the public is frustrated because the answers seem to be fairly easy you've heard from people in the national party that you'd be a pretty good looking candidate to run for president someday I suspect you won't make an announcement today but do you have plans beyond your time and I think you're right that I will not make it announcement today that's an accurate assessment but you know the truth of the matter is I've been serving for thirty years of middle 16 years as a legislator 6 as a lieutenant governor and ageism a that's a lot and 30 years is a long time so I'm gonna take a breath I can hear the noise about the presidential candidate but they say the same thing every product they talk to you because everybody's so desperate to find a way out of the difficult situation that everybody knows that we're in so although you never see never in politics it's really not something that I can foresee at the moment the world could change dramatically but I kind of doubt it alright we'll enjoy your last month and a half thank you give you a couple we said you all that is the greatest and we'll celebrate now 300th anniversary so you guys come down I was there last week and I couldn't agree more it's one of the great cities in the world thank you so much mr. mayor the book in the shadow of statues a white southerner confronts
