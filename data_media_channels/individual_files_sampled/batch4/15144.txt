so you gave a fantastic message of trying to dilute and soften extremists on both sides how do you deal with extremists on the Israeli side such as Orthodox Jews evangelical Christians those who believe in a greater Israel to annex even more land tell us about that side of the challenge listen extremists are challenging at all sides at all times I think what we're lacking these days is patience and you can have your beliefs and I'm definitely a religious believer a Jewish believer and I believe in what we're told in the Bible but I understand that we can't have everything that we believe and want here now and there's time for everything and there's a process that needs to happen and at the moment maybe we can get part of our belief we don't need to attempt to get everything and by that maybe lose what we actually have now you're a former lawyer what do you think are there problems in wresting israel's moral authority on religious texts i don't know if that height is how I would phrase it what I would say is that when I address groups when I'm asked that question I don't need to go back to the biblical promises and to the Bible and proof that this is where our land is why because I understand that the audience that I'm speaking to has different levels of beneath not over everybody shares the same levels of belief that I have I claim that we have enough legal arguments to justify our right to live here without going all the way back to biblical times why because of the peace agreements that we have signed with the Arab countries who were the occupiers of the land before we were attacked in 1967 they for that I would push us into the sea they ended up with us why during our borders in the east in the north and in the south so when people say it's against international law one it can come from lack of knowledge of international law to not remembering the accurate history and number three not understanding that the situation is way more complex than right or wrong what's your message to I guess some of pro-israel supporters who believe all all Muslims or all Palestinians are ultimately dangerous and possibly even terrorists it's a hard message it's a hard message because we believe that every human being is different from animals has the capability to understand and to think and to generalize and say that all people from a specific religion hate us is hard for me to believe I can tell you that I have meetings with Muslims religious moves Muslims they quote for me from the Quran things which don't go alongside with what some of the extremists say that that's what their religion teaches them to do they might be too afraid to speak out their minds they might be afraid of the small extreme loud violent minority who doesn't allow the rational people to speak out my attempt is to try and find ways to engage with the large same silent majority and I think we have them on both sides now I having read just one of your op eds you mentioned you've had have Islamic state on your doorstep now how how helpful is that in terms of dealing trying to soften extremist opinion on both side especially when there's a significant territorial dimension here that may not exist in other areas I think Israel strategy investing in very sophisticated intelligence at the end of the day has proved itself despite the complexity of the conflict in this region and as you mentioned with the territory issue we see that Israel is probably the only place where the Islamic state hasn't managed to step a foot down we see that areas that we have actually evacuated whether it's Lebanon in the North or the Sinai desert in the South have become areas where the Islamic state has managed to step a foot in sometimes very viciously sometimes very frightening ly people are unaware that in south Lebanon where Israel was until they were forced to go out because of political international pressure there are today a hundred and thirty thousand missiles planted underneath houses schools hotels hospitals aim to be launched towards the State of Israel these people go to sleep at night not being aware that they are sleeping on a massive ammunition bunker that can explode at any minute and that's frightening and that's a threat over Israel and I can say that within the borders of Israel we haven't experienced that but we're definitely aware of what's happening just beyond our borders is any risk that the rest of the world including the Arab world will care less and less about the israeli-palestinian issue I think what we're saying is slightly different I think they're starting to understand to call a spade a spade they are starting to understand that if the Palestinian people would have wanted to reach an understanding an agreement a peace agreement it could have been reached we say about the Palestinians that they never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity and they have become professionals in doing it but we see more and more Arab countries who see that they have an interest with leaking up linking up with Israel for various reasons which being bring them a lot of added value and that's what we're starting to see and I think that's going to spread as time goes on thank you very much sir I'm 10 be rabid if you want say more content like this go to rebel Israel calm you
