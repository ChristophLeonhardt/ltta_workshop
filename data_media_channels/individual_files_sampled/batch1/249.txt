taking months to prepare and involving tens of thousands of citizens to perform them the games are an extravagance North Korea can ill afford they haven't been staged for five years but the country's leader Kim jong-un clearly believes this period of improving relations is worth celebrating Kim embracing his South Korean counterpart while Korean characters declare a new era of reunification this display also promotes the message of strengthening relations with the international community after years of isolation I think our countries should be reunified soon and go out into the world North Korea's neighbors may be prevented by international sanctions from trading with it but tourists face less restrictions tickets for foreigners to witness this spectacle cost hundreds of dollars and thousands are expected to visit during the coming month Kim jong-un has personally overseen the development of new tourist resorts as a way of attracting visitors and their cash neighboring China is allowing a record number of tourists to visit North Korea providing a much-needed boost and Pyongyang wants to reopen a resort on its side of the DMZ border to allow a return of tourists from South Korea this is an impoverished country still under maximum international pressure not that you would know it from this display Rob mcbride al Jazeera sold
