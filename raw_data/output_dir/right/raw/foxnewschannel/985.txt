1
00:00:01,831 --> 00:00:03,899
MORE TALKS WITH NORTH KOREA, AND

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:04,633
THEN SOME.

3
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:04,934
CHRIS.

4
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:07,169
>> Chris: THANK YOU, GREG.

5
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:08,470
NOW LET'S GET REACTION TO THE

6
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,607
SUMMIT FROM REPUBLICAN

7
00:00:11,607 --> 00:00:13,209
SENATOR TOM COTTON OF ARKANSAS.

8
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,511
THE IRAQ WAR VETERAN IS A MEMBER

9
00:00:15,511 --> 00:00:16,478
OF THE SENATE ARMED SERVICES'

10
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:19,014
COMMITTEE AND HE JOINS US FROM

11
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:19,448
CAPITOL HILL.

12
00:00:19,448 --> 00:00:21,417
SENATOR, FROM THE VERY START YOU

13
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:24,520
HAVE BEEN IN YOUR OWN WORDS

14
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,422
DEEPLY SKEPTICAL OF

15
00:00:26,422 --> 00:00:27,056
NORTH KOREA'S INTENTIONS.

16
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:28,390
NOW THAT IT'S OVER, WHAT YOU

17
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:29,992
THINK OF THE SUMMIT AND THE

18
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:30,693
AGREEMENT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP

19
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:34,597
AND KIM JONG UN SIGNED?

20
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:35,264
>> CHRIS, FIRST, THANKS FOR

21
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:36,065
HAVING ME ON TO DISCUSS THIS

22
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:39,602
INCREDIBLE DAY.

23
00:00:39,602 --> 00:00:40,736
I THINK THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT

24
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:42,004
FIRST STEP BUT WE HAVE TO

25
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,472
REMEMBER IT WAS ONLY A FIRST

26
00:00:43,472 --> 00:00:43,772
STEP.

27
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:46,275
I AM SKEPTICAL OF KIM JONG UN'S

28
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:48,277
COMMITMENT TO DENUCLEARIZING

29
00:00:48,277 --> 00:00:51,413
NORTH KOREA.

30
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:52,615
I KNOW SECRETARY POMPEO HAS

31
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:53,315
ARTIE LEFT FOR SOUTH KOREA AND

32
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:55,417
THEN HE WILL BE IN CHINA

33
00:00:55,417 --> 00:00:56,185
TOMORROW.

34
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:58,387
NOW IT'S TIME TO NEGOTIATE THE

35
00:00:58,387 --> 00:01:01,223
NITTY-GRITTY DETAILS OF

36
00:01:01,223 --> 00:01:02,591
VERIFIABLY AND IRREVERSIBLY THE

37
00:01:02,591 --> 00:01:03,259
NUCLEAR RISING NORTH KOREA

38
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:05,494
PRESIDENT TRUMP HIMSELF SAID, IT

39
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:06,795
MAY NOT WORK OUT BUT THEY HAD TO

40
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:08,430
SIT DOWN AND HAVE DISAGREEMENT

41
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,431
FACE-TO-FACE BEFORE WE COULD

42
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:12,434
MOVE ONTO THE NEXT STAGE OF OUR

43
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:13,202
NEGOTIATIONS.

44
00:01:13,202 --> 00:01:16,205
>> Chris: IN THE AGREEMENT,

45
00:01:16,205 --> 00:01:18,173
KIM COMMITS TO "THE COMPLETE

46
00:01:18,173 --> 00:01:20,009
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE KOREAN

47
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:20,609
PENINSULA."

48
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,144
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE

49
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,179
WHAT HE DOES IN TERMS OF

50
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:24,914
NORTH KOREA, BUT ARE YOU

51
00:01:24,914 --> 00:01:28,584
CONCERNED THAT HE IS DEMANDING

52
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:30,152
THAT ON OUR SIDE WE FOLD THE

53
00:01:30,152 --> 00:01:32,788
NUCLEAR UMBRELLA WE HAVE HAD FOR

54
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:33,522
DECADES PROTECTING SOUTH KOREA

55
00:01:33,522 --> 00:01:36,892
AND JAPAN.

56
00:01:36,892 --> 00:01:40,396
>> NO, I'M NOT CONCERNED THAT

57
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:41,563
THE PRESIDENT WOULD WITHDRAW

58
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:42,765
THAT UMBRELLA FROM ANY OF OUR

59
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,633
ALLIES.

60
00:01:44,633 --> 00:01:47,202
KIM JONG UN HOLDS THE ONLY

61
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:47,937
NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT ARE ON THE

62
00:01:47,937 --> 00:01:49,204
PENINSULA AND THAT IS ONE THING

63
00:01:49,204 --> 00:01:50,706
THAT IS SUCH A THREAT NOT ONLY

64
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:52,975
TO SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN AND THE

65
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:54,576
AMERICAN CITIZENS, BUT TO THE

66
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:56,545
UNITED STATES NOW THAT

67
00:01:56,545 --> 00:01:58,681
KIM JONG UN HAS MISSILES THAT

68
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:00,816
CAN REACH THE UNITED STATES.

69
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:01,750
PART OF THE LONG-STANDING

70
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,620
AMERICAN POLICY IS THAT WE HAVE

71
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,621
A NUCLEAR ARSENAL PART TO

72
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:06,388
PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR ALLIES

73
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:07,890
SO THEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO

74
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,390
OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

75
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,092
I FEAR THAT SOUTH KOREA AND

76
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:13,095
JAPAN AND TAIWAN WOULD WANT TO

77
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:14,763
OBTAIN NUCLEAR WEAPONS IF WE

78
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:15,431
WEREN'T WORKING TOWARDS THE

79
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:18,200
DENUCLEARIZATION OF NORTH KOREA.

80
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,471
>> Chris: THOUGHT, SENATOR, AS

81
00:02:22,604 --> 00:02:23,339
PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED THAT

82
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:27,276
HE IS GOING TO END JOINT U.S.

83
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:28,410
MILITARY EXERCISES WITH

84
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:28,811
SOUTH KOREA.

85
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:31,180
DO YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA?

86
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,916
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THEY WERE

87
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:36,118
PAUSING THEM FOR THE TIME BEING.

88
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:37,152
WE JUST HAD THE BIGGEST SINGLE

89
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:39,855
EXERCISE EACH YEAR OCCURS IN THE

90
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:40,689
SPRING THAT PROBABLY WON'T

91
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:41,991
HAPPEN FOR ANOTHER NINE OR TEN

92
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:43,959
MONTHS UNTIL THE SPRING OF 2019.

93
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:46,128
I THINK WE WILL HAVE A PRETTY

94
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:47,429
GOOD READ ON WHETHER KIM JONG UN

95
00:02:47,429 --> 00:02:49,798
IS GOING TO KEEP HIS COMMITMENT

96
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,600
UNTIL THEN.

97
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,102
SAID HE WAS AWARE OF THE

98
00:02:53,102 --> 00:02:56,238
SUSPENSION AND HE SUPPORTS THE

99
00:02:56,238 --> 00:02:57,006
DECISION.

100
00:02:57,006 --> 00:02:58,207
REGULAR, EVERYDAY TRAINING

101
00:02:58,207 --> 00:02:59,608
EXERCISES WILL OCCUR.

102
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:00,776
SECRETARY MATTIS WOULDN'T HAVE

103
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:02,011
SUPPORTED THE DECISION IF YOU

104
00:03:02,011 --> 00:03:02,811
WEREN'T CONFIDENT THAT OUR

105
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:03,979
TROOPS WOULD BE FULLY READY TO

106
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:04,613
DEFEND OUR INTEREST ON THE

107
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:07,316
KOREAN PENINSULA.

108
00:03:07,316 --> 00:03:10,219
>> Chris: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS

109
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,153
THAT HE MAY START EASING

110
00:03:11,153 --> 00:03:14,990
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA, EVEN

111
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,659
BEFORE IT ENDS ITS ENTIRE

112
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:19,561
NUCLEAR PROGRAM, COMPLETELY

113
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:21,263
DENUCLEARIZE, OFFERING THIS

114
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:21,830
EXPLANATION.

115
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,998
TAKE A LOOK.

116
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:24,800
>> I THINK WE WILL DO IT AS FAST

117
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,035
AS IT CAN BE DONE

118
00:03:26,035 --> 00:03:26,502
SCIENTIFICALLY.

119
00:03:26,502 --> 00:03:28,404
AS FAST AS I CAN BE DONE

120
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:29,438
MECHANICALLY.

121
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:31,206
I DON'T THINK -- I MEAN, I'VE

122
00:03:31,206 --> 00:03:32,041
READ HORROR STORIES, IT'S A 15

123
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,609
YEAR PROCESS.

124
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:35,411
ASSUMING YOU WANTED TO DO IT

125
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,012
QUICKLY, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

126
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:38,580
I THINK WHOEVER WROTE THAT IS

127
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:38,881
WRONG.

128
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:42,217
BUT THERE WILL BE A POINT AT

129
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:43,886
WHICH WHEN YOU ARE 20% THROUGH

130
00:03:43,886 --> 00:03:47,923
YOU CAN'T GO BACK.

131
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:49,825
>> Chris: AS A MEMBER OF THE

132
00:03:49,825 --> 00:03:50,392
SENATE ARMED SERVICES'

133
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:51,994
COMMITTEE, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT

134
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:54,329
THAT MEANS WHEN YOU ARE 20%

135
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,399
THROUGH YOU CAN'T GO BACK?

136
00:03:57,399 --> 00:03:59,401
>> I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD

137
00:03:59,401 --> 00:04:00,369
RELAX SANCTIONS IN ANY WAY UNTIL

138
00:04:00,369 --> 00:04:01,937
WE ARE FAR DOWN THE PATH IF NOT

139
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,239
AT THE END OF THE ROAD OF

140
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:04,973
NORTH KOREA'S DENUCLEARIZATION.

141
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:05,874
I THINK THE PRESIDENT WAS USING

142
00:04:05,874 --> 00:04:09,812
THAT NUMBER AS AN EXAMPLE.

143
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:10,712
HE WILL HAVE TO OPEN HIS COUNTRY

144
00:04:10,712 --> 00:04:13,048
TO WEAPONS INSPECTORS.

145
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,616
HE WILL NEED TO MAKE A COMPLETE

146
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:15,617
DECLARATION OF HIS NUCLEAR

147
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,418
PROGRAM AND THEY WILL NEED TO

148
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,588
DEVELOP STEPS TO REMOVE THOSE

149
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:20,589
NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND CERTIFIED

150
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,255
AND DENUCLEARIZE.

151
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:22,491
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT THAT ONCE

152
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:24,193
YOU GET FAR ENOUGH DOWN THAT

153
00:04:24,193 --> 00:04:25,861
ROAD IT WOULD BE VERY HARD TO

154
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:26,428
REVERSE THOSE STEPS.

155
00:04:26,428 --> 00:04:29,398
WE SHOULD NOT RELAX SANCTIONS UP

156
00:04:29,398 --> 00:04:29,998
FRONT.

157
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:31,433
THAT'S ONE REASON WHY I WAS

158
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:33,402
OPPOSED TO DEAL WITH IRAN,

159
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:35,003
BECAUSE WE WERE RELAXING

160
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:35,871
SANCTIONS, GIVING CONCESSIONS ON

161
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,840
THE FRONT END FOR AN EASILY

162
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,074
REVERSED PROMISES AS OPPOSED TO

163
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:41,777
GETTING CONCRETE ACTION FROM OUR

164
00:04:41,777 --> 00:04:45,514
ADVERSARY AND THEN TAKING ACTION

165
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:46,014
INTO THAT PROCESS.

166
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:49,985
>> Chris: IN THE MEANTIME, THE

167
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:52,788
PRESIDENT SAYS THAT HE IS GOING

168
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:53,689
TO MAINTAIN HIS SANCTIONS

169
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:54,590
REGIME, ALTHOUGH HE'S NOT GOING

170
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,991
TO CALL IT MAXIMUM PRESSURE

171
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,926
ANYMORE, BUT HE DID SAY THAT

172
00:04:57,926 --> 00:05:01,029
SINCE THE NEGOTIATIONS HAD

173
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,598
STARTED, CHINA HAS EASED UP ON

174
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,433
SOME OF ITS TIGHT CONTROLS ON

175
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:05,300
ACTIVITY ACROSS THE BORDER.

176
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,805
IT SEEMS THAT SOUTH KOREA IS

177
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:10,606
ANXIOUS TO BEGIN TRADE WITH

178
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:12,741
NORTH KOREA AND THE QUESTION I

179
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:17,613
HAVE IS HAS BY NORMALIZING

180
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:20,015
THINGS, APPEARING HERE, MEETING

181
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:21,016
WITH PRESIDENT MOON OF

182
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:22,918
SOUTH KOREA, MEETING WITH CHINA,

183
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:24,520
AS KIM JONG UN ALREADY SUCCEEDED

184
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,754
TO SOME DEGREE IN WEAKENING THE

185
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:28,357
MAXIMUM PRESSURE CAMPAIGN?

186
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:29,391
NOT NECESSARILY BY THE

187
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:31,093
UNITED STATES, BUT BY THE REST

188
00:05:31,093 --> 00:05:32,027
OF THE WORLD?

189
00:05:32,027 --> 00:05:33,629
>> NO, I DON'T THINK HE HAS.

190
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:34,830
CHINA HAS ALWAYS DISPLAYED A

191
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,431
DOUBLE GAME WHEN IT COMES TO

192
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:37,366
NORTH KOREA ON THE ONE HAND

193
00:05:37,366 --> 00:05:38,867
SAYING THEY WANT TO DENUCLEARIZE

194
00:05:38,867 --> 00:05:40,435
NORTH KOREA BUT ON THE OTHER

195
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:42,671
HAND PROPPING UP THE REGIME

196
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:43,672
ECONOMICALLY, FINANCIALLY AND

197
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:44,072
POLITICALLY.

198
00:05:44,072 --> 00:05:45,674
THEY REALLY ONLY CAME TO THE

199
00:05:45,674 --> 00:05:47,442
TABLE OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS

200
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:48,510
BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENT'S

201
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,647
APPROACH SINCE LAST JANUARY.

202
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:52,414
THE SOUTH KOREAN ADMINISTRATION

203
00:05:52,414 --> 00:05:53,815
THAT TOOK OFFICE EARLIER THIS

204
00:05:53,815 --> 00:05:55,817
YEAR SIMPLY HAD A DIFFERENT

205
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:56,652
APPROACH THAN PREVIOUS

206
00:05:56,652 --> 00:05:57,119
ADMINISTRATIONS.

207
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,655
THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE A

208
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:00,422
GOOD JOB OF DEVELOPING A RAPPORT

209
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:01,623
WITH PRESIDENT MOON OF

210
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:03,425
SOUTH KOREA AND TRYING TO KEEP A

211
00:06:03,425 --> 00:06:05,594
CLOSE ALLIANCE STRUCTURE BETWEEN

212
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:06,828
SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN AND THE

213
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:08,530
UNITED STATES TO ENSURE THAT

214
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,097
THAT PRESSURE CAMPAIGN

215
00:06:09,097 --> 00:06:10,432
CONTINUES.

216
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:11,266
THE PRESIDENT MAY NOT WANT TO

217
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:12,801
SAY IT AFTER THE SUMMER, I WILL

218
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,604
SAY IT, WE NEED TO CONTINUE

219
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:17,005
MAXIMUM PRESSURE ON NORTH KOREA

220
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:18,173
UNTIL THEY DENUCLEARIZE.

221
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:20,008
>> Chris: FINALLY,

222
00:06:20,008 --> 00:06:21,109
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD A NUMBER OF

223
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:24,213
VERY OPTIMISTIC THINGS TO SAY

224
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,781
ABOUT WHERE THINGS STAND NOW

225
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:27,249
WITH NORTH KOREA.

226
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,650
HERE ARE A FEW CLIPS.

227
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,586
>> IT'S A VERY GREAT DAY, IT'S A

228
00:06:30,586 --> 00:06:31,386
VERY GREAT MOMENT IN THE HISTORY

229
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:33,655
OF THE WORLD.

230
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:35,624
I HAVE I THINK A VERY GOOD

231
00:06:35,624 --> 00:06:36,358
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHAIRMAN KIM

232
00:06:36,358 --> 00:06:36,725
RIGHT NOW.

233
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:39,127
I REALLY DO.

234
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:39,795
YOU CAN'T ENSURE ANYTHING.

235
00:06:39,795 --> 00:06:41,930
ALL I CAN SAY IS THEY WANT TO

236
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,234
MAKE A DEAL.

237
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,903
>> Chris: SENATOR, DO YOU

238
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:49,204
SHARE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S

239
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:49,838
OPTIMISM?

240
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,139
>> WE SPLIT UP CERTAINLY BROKEN

241
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,809
OUT OF THE RUT OF 25 YEARS OF

242
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:54,476
FAILED U.S. POLICY TOWARDS

243
00:06:54,476 --> 00:06:54,876
NORTH KOREA.

244
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:56,211
I DON'T KNOW IF KIM JONG UN IS

245
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,913
GOING TO KEEP HIS COMMITMENTS

246
00:06:57,913 --> 00:06:59,781
WERE NOT THE PRESIDENT HAS SPENT

247
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:01,283
HOURS WITH HIM NOW AND VERY FEW

248
00:07:01,283 --> 00:07:03,218
OF US HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT

249
00:07:03,218 --> 00:07:03,619
EXPERIENCE.

250
00:07:03,619 --> 00:07:05,520
I HOPE THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT.

251
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,625
BUT BECAUSE THE KIM REGIME, BOTH

252
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,892
KIM JONG UN AND HIS FATHER AND

253
00:07:10,892 --> 00:07:13,028
HIS GRANDFATHER HAD A LONG

254
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:14,029
HISTORY OF DUPLICITY.

255
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,597
WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR PRESSURE

256
00:07:15,597 --> 00:07:16,632
CAMPAIGN, WE NEED TO HOLD

257
00:07:16,632 --> 00:07:17,432
KIM JONG UN TO HIS COMMITMENTS.

258
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:19,234
I THINK WE WILL FIND OUT IN A

259
00:07:19,234 --> 00:00:00,000
MATTER OF MONTHS WHETHER HE'S
