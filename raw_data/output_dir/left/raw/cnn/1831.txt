00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,959
Hilary Clinton is taking ownership to a
degree for her stunning loss to Donald

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,859
Trump in the presidential campaign last
year now as you said her book is set to

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,309
be released next week but we purchased a
copy from a Florida bookstore late

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,420
yesterday and we did read it overnight
now she does accept more blame than she

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,500
has until now and said she takes
responsibility for a series of mistakes

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,150
but she also no surprise has strong
words for President Trump take a look at

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,250
this in one passage she writes still in
terms of fighting the previous war I

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,399
think it's fair to say that I didn't
realize how quickly the ground was

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,149
shifting under all of our feet I was
running a traditional presidential

10
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,809
campaign with carefully thought-out
policies and painstakingly built

11
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,489
coalition's while trunk was running a
reality TV show that expertly and

12
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,960
relentlessly stoked Americans anger and
resentment now she goes on to

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,230
acknowledge bluntly that she was a
lightning rod and blames that in part

14
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,850
because that she is a woman she says she
also writes about her relationship with

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,829
President Bill Clinton in ways we have
not heard her do so she says this there

16
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,069
were times that I was deeply unsure
whether our marriage could or should

17
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:10,260
survive but on those days I asked myself
the questions that mattered to me do I

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,909
still love him and can i still be in
this marriage without becoming

19
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,799
unrecognizable to myself twisted by
anger resentment or remoteness now of

20
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,759
course she also goes on to blame FBI
director James Comey for his role in the

21
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,320
election strong words for the Russian
president but in the end Chris and

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,860
Alison she says this I go back over my
own shortcomings and mistakes that were

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:00:00,000
made and I take responsibility for all
of them
