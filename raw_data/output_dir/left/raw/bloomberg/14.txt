1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,870
Synonymous with love, commitment and devotion,
precious diamonds are set on top of over three

2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,070
quarters of all engagement rings.

3
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,900
Americans alone spend eleven billion dollars
on wedding jewelry every year.

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,280
But it’s actually a pretty recent phenomenon.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,540
Here’s The Real Reason We Buy DIamonds

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,700
“She’s the girl I’m going to marry.
Get a load of this diamond ring!”

7
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:34,859
Once a very rare gem, vast diamond reserves
were found in South Africa in the late 19th

8
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:35,859
century.

9
00:00:35,859 --> 00:00:41,149
“Diamond diggers line up ready for the word
‘go’ in the latest South African diamond

10
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,149
rush”

11
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,239
One of many prospectors seeking to make their
fortune was Englishman Cecil Rhodes - he formed

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,479
the De Beers company in 1888, and eventually
took charge of much of the diamond trade,

13
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:54,129
including mining, supply and distribution.

14
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:59,409
But diamond sales dropped off during the Great
Depression of the 1930s. So De Beers turned

15
00:00:59,409 --> 00:01:01,620
to another burgeoning industry for help.

16
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,720
In 1938 De Beers commissioned Ad Agency N.W.
Ayer & Son with making diamonds a necessary

17
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,960
luxury in American lives. De Beers’ grip
on the supply meant that whoever sold a diamond

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
was likely selling one of theirs.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,470
The agency decided they had to convey the
idea that diamonds were a gift of love:

20
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,260
Men had to be convinced the larger and more
beautiful the diamond, the greater the show

21
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,720
of love.

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,680
And women had to view diamonds as an integral
part of courtship.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,740
“But before every wedding must come a prelude…
that diamond is symbolic of a pledge”

24
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,130
The agency went to Hollywood, tasking producer
Margaret Ettinger with reinforcing the image

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,570
of the diamond as integral to love - she influenced
changing the movie title "Diamonds are Dangerous"

26
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:49,030
to "Adventure in Diamonds" … and she supplied
jewelry for stars like Merle Oberon and Claudette

27
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,000
Colbert to wear on screen.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,300
Ettinger’s cousin, Louella Parsons, was
a powerful gossip columnist and also on the

29
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,800
payroll - her articles started paying particular
attention to the love lives of the stars,

30
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,880
featuring well- staged pictures of engagement
rings, or focusing on lavish and aspirational

31
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,229
jewels like Grace Kelly’s “twelve-karat
square cut diamond engagement ring.”

32
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,410
They became symbols
of upward mobility - anyone could aspire to

33
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,220
become like a movie star or a princess with
their own diamond.

34
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,560
De Beers even managed to get into schools
and churches to discuss the history of diamonds

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,681
- their true intention: sowing the seed with
children that diamond engagement rings were

36
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,950
a part of marriage and that it was a tradition.

37
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,440
By the 1940s, as America’s men went off
to war, the number of marriages started to

38
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,440
rise.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,740
Ayer also used work by great painters like
Picasso and Dali in their posters to associate

40
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,730
the diamond with a piece of classic art.

41
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,250
But it was a simple ad line that was to make
the biggest impact -

42
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,470
In 1947, Ayer copywriter Frances Gerety came
up with the slogan ‘A Diamond is Forever’

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:09,060
and the association with eternal love was
solidified. It’s appeared in every De Beers

44
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,310
advert since 1948.

45
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,950
It’s since been heralded as the ‘advertising
slogan of the century’. It was so successful

46
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:21,900
Gerety worked on every De Beers campaign until
1970. Shortly after it was immortalised in

47
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,800
the Bond film of the same name.

48
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,020
What the slogan did was create the concept
that a diamond ring would be kept by the betrothed,

49
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,810
for eternity, creating a special sentiment
but also meaning fewer would be re-sold, therefore

50
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,050
increasing the chance for De Beers to sell
more, freshly mined stones.

51
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,050
Ayer’s copywriters were also skilled in
directing consumer spending habits - suggesting

52
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,860
a month’s salary was a good amount to spend
on a ring, then upping it to two by the 1980s.

53
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,860
Over the
same period diamond sales in the United States

54
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,340
grew from $23 million to $2.1 billion.

55
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,980
De Beers and N.W. Ayer & Son’s marketing
masterpiece played on our emotions so powerfully

56
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,869
that not only were they able to sell us a
product we didn’t need but they influenced

57
00:04:20,870 --> 00:00:00,000
the culture of marriage.
