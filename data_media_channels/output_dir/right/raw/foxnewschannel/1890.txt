1
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:13,297
>> I TALKED TO THE OTTO WARMBIER

2
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:14,832
FAMILY YESTERDAY.

3
00:00:14,832 --> 00:00:17,769
OTTO WAS ON OUR MINDS.

4
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:19,737
THESE THREE WERE COMING HOME.

5
00:00:19,737 --> 00:00:22,340
HE SAID WE ARE HAPPY FOR THE

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,941
HOSTAGES AND THEIR FAMILY AND HE

7
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,943
SAID WE MISS OTTO.

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,545
>> Neil: HAD TO BE BITTERSWEET

9
00:00:27,545 --> 00:00:29,080
FOR OTTO'S PARENTS LOOKING AT

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,082
THIS AND THE THREE HOSTAGES THAT

11
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:33,618
DID RUSH HEALTHY, HAPPY AND

12
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:34,585
RELIEVED.

13
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:37,455
THE WOMAN THAT TALKED TO THEM,

14
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,692
THE CO HOST OF "FOX AND

15
00:00:40,692 --> 00:00:43,261
FRIENDS," AINSLEY EARHARDT.

16
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,564
TAKING ABOUT INSPIRATIONAL, IT'S

17
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:48,966
DOMINATING THE BEST SELLER LIST.

18
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:49,467
CONGRATULATIONS.

19
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,835
>> THANKS, NEIL.

20
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:53,638
YOU'VE ALWAYS SUPPORTED MY

21
00:00:53,638 --> 00:00:53,971
CAREER.

22
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,873
>> Neil: GRUDGINGLY.

23
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:57,575
I'M SO JEALOUS.

24
00:00:57,575 --> 00:00:59,010
ONE THING ABOUT THE BOOK.

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,779
I WANTED TO READ IT, BUT HOW

26
00:01:01,779 --> 00:01:03,481
FREELY AND HAPPY YOU ARE TO TALK

27
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:06,084
ABOUT GOD, TO TALK ABOUT

28
00:01:06,084 --> 00:01:08,920
RELIGION, TO TALK ABOUT YOUR

29
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,220
FAITH.

30
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,790
THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FORBIDDEN

31
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:13,124
TODAY.

32
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:15,693
>> WHEN THEY APPROACHED ME ABOUT

33
00:01:15,693 --> 00:01:17,428
WRITING THIS BOOK, THEY SAID DO

34
00:01:17,428 --> 00:01:20,364
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR

35
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:20,665
FAITH?

36
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:24,268
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HEAR

37
00:01:24,268 --> 00:01:24,569
OFTEN.

38
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:26,370
I HAD TO SAY YES TO THAT.

39
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,638
DID DID TWO CHILDRENS BOOKS.

40
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:29,240
I WAS GOING TO TAKE A VACATION.

41
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,808
I NEED TO BREATHE A LITTLE BIT

42
00:01:30,808 --> 00:01:32,744
BECAUSE I'M A MOTHER AND WORKING

43
00:01:32,744 --> 00:01:34,946
FULL TIME AND AN AUTHOR.

44
00:01:34,946 --> 00:01:36,147
THE BOOK TOUR IS WONDERFUL

45
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:37,548
BECAUSE YOU GET TO MEET YOUR --

46
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:39,684
THE PEOPLE THAT WATCH US EVERY

47
00:01:39,684 --> 00:01:41,285
DAY AND PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLE

48
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:42,787
AND WE HUG THEM AND SAY THANK

49
00:01:42,787 --> 00:01:43,121
YOU.

50
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:44,922
BUT IT CAN BE EXHAUSTING AT

51
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:45,223
TIMES.

52
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:46,991
I FELT LIKE I HAD TO SAY YES TO

53
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:47,291
THAT.

54
00:01:47,291 --> 00:01:49,794
HOW CAN YOU SAY NO TO GOD?

55
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,696
TELL YOUR STORY ABOUT GOD.

56
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:52,196
OKAY.

57
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,098
>> Neil: YOU KEPT THAT -- YOU --

58
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:56,968
RIGHT AWAY YOU SAY I DEDICATE

59
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:00,104
THIS BOOK TO MY LORD AND SAVE

60
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:02,406
YOUR JESUS CHRIST.

61
00:02:02,406 --> 00:02:04,642
I KNOW I'LL HAVE AN ETERNAL LIFE

62
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:06,110
WITH CHRIST.

63
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,045
ALMOST EVERY CHAPTER YOU TAKE A

64
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,815
PAGE FROM THE BIBLE.

65
00:02:10,815 --> 00:02:13,451
AGAIN AND AGAIN, WE'RE SUPPOSED

66
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:17,088
TO BE IN THIS ROUGH AND TUMBLE

67
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:18,489
WORLD OF JOURNALISM AND SAY

68
00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:18,956
NASTY THINGS.

69
00:02:18,956 --> 00:02:20,892
YOU DON'T FOLLOW THAT

70
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:21,292
TEMPTATION.

71
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:24,061
>> I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN THIS

72
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:27,131
WEIGHT ON MY HEART THROUGH THIS

73
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:28,733
LATEST POLITICAL CHALLENGE.

74
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:29,700
IF YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY THAN

75
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,035
SOMEONE ELSE, YOU'RE HATED.

76
00:02:31,035 --> 00:02:32,170
SO I DON'T LIKE THAT.

77
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,504
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT IS THE

78
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:34,705
TEMPERATURE OF THE MAJORITY OF

79
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:35,439
THE COUNTRY.

80
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:36,941
I FEEL LIKE THE MAJORITY WANTS

81
00:02:36,941 --> 00:02:38,709
TO BE HAPPY AND POSITIVE AND I

82
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:40,778
THINK THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BOOK

83
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:42,446
LIKE THIS BECAUSE IT DOES REMIND

84
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:44,248
YOU THAT GOD IS IN CONTROL AND

85
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,850
IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE

86
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,786
BLACK OR WHITE OR A DEMOCRAT OR

87
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,688
A REPUBLICAN OR --

88
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:53,825
>> Neil: BUT YOU SAID, LIKE WOW,

89
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,626
THIS IS REALLY --

90
00:02:55,626 --> 00:02:57,595
>> I WANT TO SAY, I LOVE YOU

91
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,597
AROUND YOUR GOD'S CHILD.

92
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,431
WHOEVER IS WRITING THIS ARTICLE

93
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,699
DIDN'T REACH OUT TO ME.

94
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:03,467
IF THEY DID, I KNEW IT WOULD BE

95
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:04,402
A NEGATIVE ARTICLE.

96
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:06,137
WE GET ATTACKED ALL THE TIME.

97
00:03:06,137 --> 00:03:09,407
SO I WANT TO SAY --

98
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:11,676
>> Neil: IT'S THE OTHERS.

99
00:03:11,676 --> 00:03:14,478
>> I WANT TO SAY, YOU DON'T KNOW

100
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:14,745
US.

101
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,647
IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO THROW

102
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:16,981
STONES.

103
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:18,850
WE ALL HAVE OUR ISSUES AND DOING

104
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,784
THE BEST WE CAN.

105
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,385
WE WANT TO SEND OUR KIDS TO

106
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:21,719
COLLEGE.

107
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:23,487
WE WANT TO PROVIDE A NICE LIFE

108
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:24,856
FOR OUR CHILDREN.

109
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:25,923
A SAFE LIFE.

110
00:03:25,923 --> 00:03:27,959
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW YOU

111
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:28,259
VOTE.

112
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:29,493
>> Neil: I'M NOT LEAVING

113
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:31,262
ANYTHING TO THE KIDS.

114
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:32,930
I THINK THEY'RE ON THEIR OWN

115
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,998
AND --

116
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:36,067
>> THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT.

117
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,135
WE DIDN'T GROW UP WITH MUCH.

118
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,403
>> Neil: YOU MENTIONED GROWING

119
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:39,670
UP.

120
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,472
YOUR DAD WAS VERY -- CHEAP IS

121
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:42,673
NOT THE WORD BUT HE WATCHED

122
00:03:42,673 --> 00:03:43,374
EVERY PENNY.

123
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:44,775
DIDN'T HAVE A CREDIT CARD.

124
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:46,110
YOU GREW UP LIKE THAT.

125
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,245
>> I DID.

126
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:48,246
I AM GRATEFUL.

127
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:50,648
AT THE TIME I LOOKED AT MY

128
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,383
FRIENDS THAT HAD EVERYTHING.

129
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,284
I WANTED THAT.

130
00:03:53,284 --> 00:03:54,852
BUT I'M SO GRATEFUL.

131
00:03:54,852 --> 00:03:56,354
MY DAD WORKED SO HARD, SOMETIMES

132
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:57,255
THREE JOBS.

133
00:03:57,255 --> 00:03:59,290
WRITING THANK YOU NOTES TO HIS

134
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,157
CUSTOMERS IN THE MIDNIGHT.

135
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,193
HE GAVE UP HIS COACHING CAREER

136
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:05,129
SO HE COULD SELL JANITORIAL

137
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:05,529
SUPPLIES.

138
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:06,564
TOILET PAPER.

139
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,332
OUR SOAP IS ONE OF THE BRANDS

140
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,669
THAT HE USED TO SELL.

141
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:13,838
IT'S SUCH -- I REMEMBER COMING

142
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:17,108
TO FOX AND SEEING THAT SANI SOAP

143
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,709
AND THINKING, MY DAD SOLD THIS

144
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,779
SO I COULD COME HERE.

145
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:24,548
TOILET PAPER, CARPETS, ANYTHING

146
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,450
AND TO THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.

147
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,552
WHEN YOU GO THE SCHOOLS AND THE

148
00:04:28,552 --> 00:04:32,690
BATHROOM, MY DAD SOLD THAT IN

149
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,324
COLUMBIA, SOUTH CAROLINA.

150
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:34,959
MY MOM WENT TO WORK EVERY DAY.

151
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,028
SHE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO BE A

152
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:40,097
STAY AT HOME MOM AND RAISE THREE

153
00:04:40,097 --> 00:04:40,598
KIDS.

154
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:41,933
>> Neil: BUT YOU LOOK NOW, YOU

155
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,601
SAY HEY, OUR FRIENDS ARE TALKING

156
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:47,605
ABOUT YOU IN THE MORNING AND ON

157
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:48,105
"FOX AND FRIENDS."

158
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,674
NOW "FOX AND FRIENDS," PROBABLY

159
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:51,542
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SHOW

160
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,377
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE VERY BIG

161
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:53,711
VIEWER.

162
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,478
>> WE DO.

163
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:55,780
>> Neil: HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

164
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,180
THAT?

165
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,883
>> WE OPEN THE BOOK SAYING, YOU

166
00:04:58,883 --> 00:04:59,951
KNOW, MY FRIENDS ARE SAYING

167
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:00,918
YOU'RE FAMOUS.

168
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:03,788
I KNOW, IT'S SO WEIRD, MOM.

169
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:04,789
>> Neil: DOES THAT PUT PRESSURE

170
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:05,957
WHEN YOU TALK TO THE PRESIDENT?

171
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:06,590
>> NO.

172
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,559
I'M GOING TO BE MYSELF NO MATTER

173
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:08,859
WHAT.

174
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,661
I WANT TO BE GRACIOUS TO EVERY

175
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,797
VIEWER, EVERY PERSON ON OUR

176
00:05:12,797 --> 00:05:13,164
SHOW.

177
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:15,399
I REALIZE THEY'RE WAKING UP

178
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,567
EARLY TO BE ON OUR SHOW.

179
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,336
I WANT TO BE GRACIOUS BUT I WANT

180
00:05:18,336 --> 00:05:20,338
TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS.

181
00:05:20,338 --> 00:05:22,873
YOU KNOW, BE A JOURNALIST AS

182
00:05:22,873 --> 00:05:23,174
WELL.

183
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:24,308
THAT PHRASE HAS CHANGED.

184
00:05:24,308 --> 00:05:25,142
A TV HOST.

185
00:05:25,142 --> 00:05:27,111
BUT I STILL WANT TO ASK THE

186
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:27,611
TOUGH QUESTIONS.

187
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:28,980
>> Neil: I WAS THINKING OF YOU,

188
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,413
TOO.

189
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:35,219
RIGHT AWAY YOU GET INTO THIS,

190
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,021
ROGER AILES, OUR CHAIRMAN.

191
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:38,689
YOU MENTIONED HIM IN YOUR BOOK.

192
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,591
YOU SAID ROGER'S FALL REMINDS

193
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,226
YOU HOW FRAGILE LIFE IS.

194
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:44,729
NOT JUST PHYSICAL EXISTENCE BUT

195
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,265
OUR INTEGRITY AND REPUTATION.

196
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,534
AND MANY PUT DOWN PRESIDENT

197
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:52,970
PENCE BECAUSE WHEN HE DOESN'T GO

198
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,338
OUT TO EAT.

199
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:57,375
YOU SAID HE DOES PUT WALLS

200
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,312
AROUND HIS INTEGRITY TO GUARD

201
00:06:01,312 --> 00:06:02,680
HIMSELF AGAINST THE APPEARANCE

202
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,882
OF EVIL.

203
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,183
IF WE CHANGE OURSELVES, IT

204
00:06:06,183 --> 00:06:06,684
CONTINUES TODAY.

205
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:07,451
>> FOR THE BETTER.

206
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,953
I'M RAISING A DAUGHTER.

207
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,654
I WANT US TO CHANGE AND EVOLVE

208
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:11,622
FROM WHERE WE WERE.

209
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:12,990
DID IT BREAK ANY HEART WHEN

210
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,893
ROGER PASSED AWAY?

211
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:16,160
YES.

212
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,531
I FEEL LIKE THAT SIN ERODED AND

213
00:06:20,531 --> 00:06:21,632
CORRUPTED HIS LIFE AND CHANGED

214
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,700
HIS LIFE AND TOOK HIS LIFE.

215
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,768
>> YOU NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT.

216
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:25,736
>> I NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT.

217
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,405
MY STORY IS DIFFERENT FROM THESE

218
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:27,705
WOMEN.

219
00:06:27,705 --> 00:06:29,273
I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD THIS.

220
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:30,941
OUR WORLD WAS TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN

221
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:31,642
HERE AT FOX.

222
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:33,077
HE DID PUT FOOD ON MY TABLE.

223
00:06:33,077 --> 00:06:33,911
HE HIRED ME.

224
00:06:33,911 --> 00:06:38,416
HE ALLOWED MY DREAMS TO COME

225
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:38,716
TRUE.

226
00:06:38,716 --> 00:06:41,118
THEN I HEAR STORIES THAT INVOLVE

227
00:06:41,118 --> 00:06:42,453
MY FRIENDS HERE AT FAX.

228
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,188
I WAS APPALLED.

229
00:06:44,188 --> 00:06:44,922
IT WAS WRONG.

230
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:48,092
BUT YOU KNOW, I DID FEEL SORRY

231
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:49,727
FOR HIS FAMILY AND IT ULTIMATELY

232
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:50,528
KILLED HIM.

233
00:06:50,528 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Neil: AND YOU MOVED ON.
