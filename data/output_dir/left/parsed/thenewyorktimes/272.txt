Hi, Judah.
Things haven’t been
great for us so far.
Being away from you for
three years is killing me.
It seems like an eternity.
And Granny can’t come here
because of her car issues.
But this is the perfect
opportunity for us
to see each other
after such a long time.
I’m so excited and feel
like I’m a little kid.
See you soon.
Love, Mom.
We have to go!
Come on!
Can you wait for your sister?
Is that what you wanted to say?
Is she sitting with us too?
Let’s go.
Why is the road so bumpy?
Look how far we
are from Richmond!
I mean, Oakland.
(SINGING) Three, two, one.
And we went ablazing in
our favorite rocket ship
through the stars.
Do you want to .
Climb aboard.
Let’s get ready to depart.
OK, when you go in,
these people are
going to be very caring
to you, and they’re going
to ask to see your paperwork.
Just make sure you
have it with you.
And you’re going to go
through a metal detector.
It’s not scary.
You’re going to be fine.
Next, next, next family, please.
Next family.
Next family, please.
Hey!
Hi.
 I love you.
Come on.
I saw y’all coming.
What took y’all so long?
I couldn’t even bring her a
can of milk in or her wipes.
I had to take her wipes out.
Oh, she’s sleepy.
Look at the camera.
And then —
You gonna come live with me?
Mm-hmm.
I would like — may I have, how
about — they all look so good.
A green one.
I don’t want to drink it!
It’s good.
It’s ugly!
But it’s good.
Good.
Oh, it didn’t hurt.
Are you going to
color in line style?
Anybody want some more pencils?
“Inmates will stay out here.
After your families leave,
inmates will stay here.”
Come here. Come here.
Thank you for coming.
I’m glad you were here.
I love you, buddy.
 O.K.?
OK.
I love you.
It was fun.
But it wasn’t fun.
When I left, I tried
not to think about it
as much because I knew that
would just make me even more
emotional than I already am.
And there was nothing
I could do about it.
So it’s like, you have to
accept the fact that you
have to leave.
I’m kind of used to
this stuff because she’s
been in jail before.
And also, my dad left
me when I was three.
And he died when I was nine.
So it’s like, I’m sort of, kind
of getting used to the feel of,
like, getting hurt.
