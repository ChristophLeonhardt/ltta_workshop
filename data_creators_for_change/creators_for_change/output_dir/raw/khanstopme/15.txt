00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,901
- ALS currently has no cure.

2
00:00:01,901 --> 00:00:03,322
It's a degenerative disease.

3
00:00:03,322 --> 00:00:06,076
That means that you slowly
lose control of your muscles.

4
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:07,255
For the pharmaceutical industry

5
00:00:07,255 --> 00:00:08,623
the disease isn't profitable,

6
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:10,240
which means that investors
have no incentive

7
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,176
to invest money into the research of ALS.

8
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:14,751
This is why donations to
the cause is important.

9
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:18,785
In the UK, all you need to
do is text ICED55 to 70070.

10
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,053
Raising awareness is also important,

11
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:22,299
because we have the power
to help these people,

12
00:00:22,299 --> 00:00:24,567
and the Ice Bucket
Challenge is also important,

13
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,893
but only if you donate.

14
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,279
Let's do this!
