recently an article was written about the emergence of anti-vaxxers now anti-vaxxers have been around they made a lot of headlines in recent years because they believe that vaccines would lead to autism among children now of course that's been debunked time and time again however this new generation of anti-vaxxers are concerned about vaccines for their pets specifically for their dogs so according to Brooklyn paper a growing number of folks in New York's hippest neighborhoods simply will not take their pets in for routine shots some of those shots include rabies shots which are supposed to get every year for your pet one person you know just to provide an example one person had tweeted a dog leader called the clinic today and asked could vaccines make their dog autistic like they do with humans so I guess that's an employee from a vet a clinic but there was an actual veterinarian that who was asked about this her name is Amy fort and she said we do see a higher number of clients who don't want to vaccinate their animals this may be stemming from the anti-vaccine movement which people are now applying to their pets she also says is actually much more common in the hipstery areas I really don't know what the reasoning is they just feel that injecting chemicals into their pet is going to cause problems now to be fair Brooklyn paper did not interview any of these anti-vaxxers I'd be really curious to hear from them and what they think but here's the thing I have a dog I love my dog I just feel like we're not worthy of dogs right okay they're just so I'm pretty precious innocent pure like loving things and we we're not worthy okay I hear you sister take care of your dog what's wrong with you okay so I I thought when you said to be fair the Brooklyn paper did not interview you were gonna end the sentence with did not interview any of the dogs to see if they were in fact autistic okay I don't know how you would find out if a dog is autistic you know why cuz they're not humans I know you think they are I know she thinks they are but they're not okay another another vet said we've never diagnosed autism and a dog I don't think you could oh how would you know all right anyway this is the two ends of the political spectrum coming together you know the uber left in the uber right they're like if there's one thing we know science isn't true that guys to be fair there is a range of people in the anti-vaccine movement right and there's the ones who have totally unsubstantiated views and then they're the people who are concerned about mercury in some of the vaccines that's an interesting thought I I don't have an opinion on and I'm not like oh it's totally true and oh my god no I do all the vaccines and all that stuff right but what I was trying to do is find a there was an intelligent person who wanted to make the mercury case on the on the show we're gonna have them debate someone and no one will debate anyone who's anti vaccine it's amazing we reached out to all the doctors the scientists cuz I'm like look I don't want to just interview the anti vaccine person because that might present a skewed view of it and I'm not an expert and I can't debunk so I want to make sure there's someone else - and they're like no won't do it won't do it that's really strange I know we asked a ton of people and couldn't find anybody to pick up their Mandal anyway so and don't necessarily submiss everyone out of hand at the same time look that you need those vaccines not only for humans but yes for dogs if your dog might have rabies you need a vaccine or might get rabies right you're not doing your dog any favors by not getting the vaccines let alone your neighborhood so if he starts to break out in Brooklyn among hipsters I will be greatly amused I mean that's a shame we're trying to prevent it so go get the vaccine that the dogs need if you care about that yeah and look I maybe there are some people who think that vaccines are harmful for their pets but I think the bigger issue is they're expensive like vaccines for your pets are expensive take a while you should yeah so I feel like they might be using that as an excuse like oh yeah maybe really bad no no I bet hipsters definitely believe way over John you can really do because they didn't interview any of these so-called hipsters who refused to vaccinate their dogs right we I mean at least we heard from the vets who say yeah there's a growing trend but just please vaccine yeah and if your progressive and your son to agree with Michelle Bachman you might want to check yourself it can't happen he can't happen on some issues this is probably not the hill you want to die on or for your pets to die because remember animals are innocent help us build independent media together come join us TYT Network comm /join
