hi everybody this is Kurt Schlichter and I'm back with another edition of take that here on rebel media this is the show where I get on camera and I say things sometimes I talk to other people we're not going to do that today this is all Kurt all the time it's you it's me it's that camera we got a lot of stuff to talk about and we're gonna do that right now there's some great news today today is the day Mike Pompeo and Rick Grinnell should be confirmed by the Senate for their jobs Mike Pompeo is gonna be our next Secretary of State yeah he's not qualified at all he was only oh I don't know number one at West Point in his class and they went to Harvard and then he was you know in Congress and he was a CIA director and everybody voted for him except now they're not going to because they don't want to give Donald Trump a victory they just want to deny him a victory they want to deny Donald Trump the ability to operate the government that he was elected to be chief executive of and why would they do that well that's kind of gonna be the theme today the other big nomination big confirmation is my friend Rick Grinnell Rick actually lives in town with me so I'll be I've literally been to the movies twice and turn around and there's like our next ambassador to Germany that's Rick hey Rick how you doing hey how you doing Curt what's up want some popcorn very very small town here in the South Bay of Los Angeles but but Rick more than that Rick's not only you know a friend Rick is a great guy Rick is exactly what we need both as conservatives and Americans okay everybody talks about the fact that Rick is gay yes Rick is gay so what what that tells us is two things first of all that the conservative movement has opened itself to a variety of people you know there's idiots babble about diversity they whine and complain about diversity but the only diversity that they like is based on these these characteristics that don't really matter raised and sags and gender and identity and all that's nonsense they want a diversity of ideas but that's what Rick brings Rick brings something that they can't tolerate he is a person who's supposed to be in this box and they want to shove him in that box and he won't go and they've got to stop him they've got to stop him now fortunately that isn't going to happen Rick's our ambassador Germany and that's that's a done deal finally after screwing around for a year but the Democrats just did not want Donald Trump to be able to not only function is a chief executive but didn't want him to demonstrate that the conservative movement is a diverse movement of many different kinds of people united by an idea it's the idea embodied in our constitution that all human beings have certain inalienable rights including the right to govern themselves and the right to speak freely and the right to think for themselves in worship as they see fit and also keeping bear arms Oh we'll be talking about the Second Amendment a little later today so anyway Wow now this is this obstruction thing what's this about I mean look the Democrats are sore losers because they were promised that the smartest woman in the history of ever was going to be elected president and of course she failed because she's a drunken harpy and a buffoon well felonious von pantsuits failure led to a lot of great YouTube videos of whining liberals crying you know men women none binaries sobbing that Hillary failed and I look I enjoy them whenever I'm down I like to go on YouTube now to search Hillary fail your photos and movies and stuff because I'm bad at searching and you know I can just watch for hours all these you know divorced middle-aged count women with the tears running down their face all these weird hipsters with their porkpie hats and t-shirts for that you've probably never heard of sobbing uncontrollably on November 8th because Donald Trump crushed her the American people rejected her and went rejected her rejected them and so they're angry and that's where we get this obstruction now I remember because I'm old October of 2016 where there was this big fuss where Hillary Clinton was criticizing Donald Trump for refusing to accept the results of the election and that was you know that was terrible an attack on our democracy in treason and of course starting November 9 she did exactly the same thing and so do our minions hypocrisy thy name is liberal and they haven't stomped and they've continued on because they can't accept the fact that they are no longer in power they can't accept the fact that normal Americans said mmm Heil no we're not gonna take that malignant harpy and allow her to be president and run rampant and destroy our rights because that's what she would do that is what Hillary wants to do remember you gotta understand liberals consider rights those rights granted to us merely by being created merely by existing the right to speak freely to write freely to worship freely to defend ourselves with firearms those rights are an obstacle to their power and we're gonna talk a little more about that we're talking about a little about Britain in a minute and what happens when you give up your rights and how it's a slippery slope it's not a slippery slope it's a tsunami you give up one night they're all done so anyway the Democrats are obstructing Donald Trump because they they're angry and they want to regain power and they're hoping they can make his presidency a disaster an utter disaster one that when he's unable to function and now he keeps running circles around him you know he's getting his guys confirmed not all of them you know the the Admiral who's gonna run the VA had to drop out because of some pretty scummy allegations against him I don't know if they're true or not but you know he dropped out after having reputation tarnish because he dared you know be associated with Donald Trump this is part of it this is part of trying to make being non liberal radioactive and that's part of the obstruction they want to take being a conservative being a normal American and make it out of mainstream 43% of Americans who voted voted for Donald Trump and they essentially want to make those 43 percent of Americans exiles in their own country out of the main sprint abnormal unworthy of being considered unworthy of self-governance unable to govern themselves that's what the obstruction is that's why they won't cooperate and I'm not talking about supporting Donald Trump you have to have an opposition he always still keeps you honest but obstruction is throwing sand into the gears of government trying to make it so government can't function not that he can't enact his policies but that he can't exercise any of the power that was invested in him when he won the election when he won the election that's important because what they do cast legitimate casts doubt on the legitimacy of our government if we the voters can't elect someone and and have that person be able to exercise power then really what have we done we've done nothing we're not a representative democracy we're not a republic we're a Banana Republic but but that's kind of what they want and speaking of banana republics let's talk about Great Britain used to be a beacon of freedom a shining symbol of Liberty and look at it now what a disaster Britain has gone from a place where you could dissent and you could speak freely and you could do what you want to a place where you can dissent and speak freely and do what you want as long as you absolutely with the elite otherwise they will literally put you in jail let's review some of the recent atrocities so there's some guy named count dank EULA he's like a Scottish comic he's got all these weird piercings he's kind of a silly man but he made a really kind of unfunny joke involving his dog and Hitler and the Holocaust and it wasn't particularly funny but he posted it on YouTube and probably got arrested yes police came to his house because he said words and he published a video I want you to think about that in the United Kingdom someone says something he utters words and police come and arrest him they literally put him in handcuffs and haul him into jail and court and he's convicted and it was fine oh lucky him he didn't have to go to jail for saying words think about that now just the other day there was a tweet by some British police organization which our remember the gentle Bobby I wrote called oh never long you know nothing to say you know the the classic Bobby has become this goose-stepping stasi bastard who's out there surfing social media trying to find somebody sings somebody who's saying something that they don't like and now they're like these big signs if you're if you're racist or sexist or imperialist or offensive as my favorite offensive on social media we're coming to get you you're gonna be arrested and OH arrested for words just think about that arrested for words and now there's some guy and he was driving his car past these you know the little like chronic traffic control things and would take photos he'd always give him the finger I always you know flip them the bird because you know screw you authorities yeah that's cool he's a Landrover he's doing his thing um they arrest him and put him in jail for nine months or eight months and it gets better and then it's police organization we did it with the picture saying here's what he did he he violated the processes of law I know he's doing eight months in jail all of you obey think about that think about that the police out there commanding people to obey threatening them and and and they think this is perfectly fine and then there's baby Alfie this is a little baby he's got a terminal brain disease allegedly terminal they keep trying to kill him and he refuses to die he's in a hospital and his you know a National Health Service Hospital that's government-run health care single-payer remember there are no death panels no death mr. Palin strolling wrong no death panels except the National Health Service decided that baby may be Alfie had to die because his life wasn't worth living now his parents disagreed and you might think that his parents might have a say in you know determining the treatment of their child whether you know you know it's a very basic they they should keep on living that they should have some input into that decision no no not in Britain because people no longer belong to themselves in Britain they belong to the government and the NS NHS has got to see let him die because they can't have people standing up to him they they can't let people have an alternative and there is an alternative Italy which seems to like human life said hey we will send a military airplane we will take him and we will come and we will take him to Italy and treat him and the British government was like now and we're not gonna lecture no he has to die even though there's no chance we don't think there's any chance for me he has got to die Wow you know just give us a shot what do you have to lose our standing our power no he's got a dying parents go to hell yeah they actually put guards around baby Alfie like 30 policemen around baby Alfie to make sure no one rescued him from his certain death because they're starting they're like refusing to feed him and all I can think of is where were those 30 cops when rape gangs of immigrants we're going around sexually abusing hundreds of girls in Britain oh hey the police didn't want to bust those up because somebody might call them racist if they arrested people for raping little girls but they can always find plenty of bobbies to ensure an innocent child dies no matter what so that's Britain they used to be a free country now what's a big difference between Britain and the United States well I mean we have our written constitution they have traditions okay all right that's one thing what do we have here let me think what we have here in the United States it makes it really hard for the government to act in an unchallenged manner to trample our rights what what do we have here that makes it oh yeah yeah our citizens have guns we have lots of guns we have 300 million guns and us Americans were pretty picky about you know laws and things that affect our right to keep and bear arms our sacred right to have firearms to use for the defense of ourselves our families our communities and our Constitution do we think that it would be okay to do these kinds of things here in the United States the kind of things they're doing in Britain and as a practical matter could they because in Britain they they have no guns they have totally been disarmed they are completely at the power of the government they are subjects we are citizens we retain the power to change our government we retain the power to fight tyranny they're you know they're getting called into jail for saying words hauled into jail for daring to give the finger to the police exactly put him in prison for eight months for getting finger priests and of course little kids have to die so the pride of the National Health Service is not acted in any way and they have to suck it up they have no choice they have no options because they have no power but America we have power we have the power which comes with decentralized weapons in the hands of citizens in other words the the government does not have a monopoly of violence in the United States with 300 million guns out there 300 million it's the people of the United States that have the power here's the question and I get this a lot well Americans ever have to use that power because we've seen with the obstruction the obstruction is just an attack on democracy and make no mistake many many many liberals if not most if not if it's not a basic plank in their platform agree with what's going on in Britain they absolutely agree they agree that you should be able to be arrested and put in prison for saying certain words that they don't like they believe that if you defy authority by say giving the finger to a police camera you should be put in prison they believe that the government should determine if your life is valuable enough to go on now I remember there's this big thing about Sarah Palin the death panels but that's exactly what we're seeing in Britain we are seeing exactly what Sarah Palin predicted in their single-payer health system because of course they have to because if it's single-payer somebody's got to decide who gets paid and who doesn't and do you think it's going to be you it's not gonna be it's not gonna be me it's gonna be some bureaucrat somewhere and they're gonna use their own criteria and it's not going to be ours and you know what's not gonna be their number one criteria are lies they're number one criteria is supporting the system look at look at public schools does anyone think that most public schools or at least the ones in the big inner city districts because in the suburban areas we can't can take control and hassle the principals but in the big suburb a big inner city urban areas to the school's work to teach the kids or do they work to perpetuate the livelihoods of the administrators and faculty same thing with Health Service if you think wait when you know when you impose single-payer you do not repeal human nature okay people can be greeting and obnoxious and that's what would happen in single-payer and that's what we're seeing in Britain without it now let's get back to the United States let's get back to why this is a problem in the United States let's talk about a subject that's kind of scary it's a subject of civil war do I think there's going to be a civil war no but there's a lot of talk about it people are scared they see a tax on our rights they see what's happening in Britain and they're afraid that we're gonna follow they see the obstruction in Congress they see people particularly on the Left completely abandoning the ideas that our founders set forth and the question is what are we gonna do where where are we gonna go as a people house is gonna end what's at the bottom of this slippery slope I really help spoiler alert I've seen it I served in Kosovo I saw what happens when the rule of law gave way to the rule of power I walked through those ruined villages I saw the consequence scares the hell out of me terrifies me and you know I've been trying to tell people I write articles in Town Hall about a you know let's let's have the rule okay let's not that's not you know embrace conflict I write novels People's Republic in Indian country which are novels speculated on our future where America splits apart into you know a blue and a red section and and what happens and some of it talks about civil violence what happens when you know it comes to blows now Kurt this is crazy talk a bunch of farmers with hunting rifles can't take on a modern military I love that argument it's really interesting to me because a it's an indictment of our schools because obviously these guys never heard of things like Vietnam and Iraq and Afghanistan um but you know I was a military guy for a while and I kind of gotta know a little about this stuff let's talk about the practical side of the civil what would happen if there was some kind of civil war in the United States really I mean what would it look like what capabilities do people have what terrain are they talking about because those are really important combat power terrain two of the most important things and you know is it just a matter of well you know you guys would be surprised you know these rebels would be suppressed you know they got tanks and drones and b-2 bombers and nuclear warheads and stuff okay well you got to tell you first of all you're not really bringing you know supporting the legitimacy of a tyrannical government by saying they could nuke other Americans that's does not strike me as that that strikes me as a poor art anyway let's timeout the snare one scenarios leftist rebelling against a Conservative government or you know normal Americans rebelling against a leftist dictatorship seems to be the one that people were most concerned about because you know we've seen attempts to ban guns attempt to limit speech making people bake eggs it's just getting ugly and if the democrats got back into path we've seen the obstruction of trump so the democrats got back into power does anybody anybody let's see show hands anybody think that they'll be super eager to give up power again people were worried that we would have to be pried away from them by force that there would be no legitimacy or legitimate change of government following that one last election so what would look like okay let's talk about numbers okay how many people do you think there are in the military how many do you think there are well there's a couple million okay you got some you know includes reserve has made three Miller yourself how are you gonna use them to enforce some sort of leftist tyranny you know remember that map the famous 2016 map of counties that voted for Hillary and counties that voted for Donald Trump and you look at the united states and except for little spots of blue you know kind of on the coast and few in the middle it's all red that's a lot of terrain that is unfriendly to a potentially tyrannical liberal government has a lot of space and that space includes things that are important like Oh farmland where we produce our oil where the resources are you know the problem the the strategic problem for the left you know in running a tyrannical government is their power is centralized it is centralized in big cities essentially urban areas that's where their real strength is that's that's where you get the hard blue stuff like here in Los Angeles hard blue area but you go out 50 miles suddenly it becomes a little more red that means that to effectively suppress a a rebellion by other Americans they would have to move they would have to gather forces and move out of the urban areas and they've got a lot of ground to cover I mean that's a lot of space the fact is it would be very hard to forcibly govern the United States America this America operates on consent it's simply too big to do it any other way look the police aren't out there being proactive the police in America are reactive why because most Americans obey the law the police are not designed for a country that's actively uncover noble okay and of course the military's not designed for internal security work so you have a misfit you you have a large area that has to be covered and you have a mismatch of forces our police officers are designed to deescalate violence yeah I know they're shooting people after right no they really aren't they're generally designed deescalate violence and the way they win is by putting like 50 cops against one bank robber they win by doing multiples of combat power even you remember the Holly North Hollywood shootout those two idiots at that Bank they had supremists at fire supremacy with their weapons for a few minutes and more and more cops showed up with better and better weapons that's kind of what happens to criminals a criminal is never going to out done the police criminal is going to temporarily out gun the police and then try and get away because he can never stand up against the force of law enforcement they just can't because it will always increase it will always overwhelm him the problem faced in a counterinsurgency situation is that's not necessarily true how many cops do you think there are well there's a fair number in the big cities ten and fifteen thousand and city like New York if you were in Los Angeles and Chicago and other places but they just aren't that many remember what happened in Boston yeah those two idiots with pistols the Boston bombers and they froze the entire say the entire city was frozen was was completely ground to a halt by two untrained idiots with handguns think of 12 guys who know how to operate their weapons a lot of veterans out there a lot of hunters out there a lot of people with actual skills that provides a real problem for a Turan tyranny that wishes to conduct an insurgent counterinsurgency operation so what would that look like well I mean you obviously have the police but how many police are actually gonna do it you get out to you know the the random County Sheriff out in Nebraska you think he's gonna line up to arrest his neighbors because you know president Hillary Clinton back in Washington ordered all guns confiscated I don't think so even and even in big city departments first of all most the cops don't live in the big city they go out to the suburbs and those suburbs are generally red you're not gonna see a lot of the rank-and-file in law enforcement fall in the line with a counterinsurgency oh you'll see some the leadership will because they're mostly liberal because they're appointed by liberals you'll see some people who actually believe liberal nonsense and would do it you'll see some people who just want to make their money you know I just want my paycheck I'll do whatever I have to do but you will see significant dropouts in law enforcement including whole departments once you get outside the city that will just not participate federal law enforcement yeah you'll have some of the same problem but we've seen the FBI is always willing to support a liberal totalitarian regime so you see do you have that but again they're there investigators they're not street cops to own ground to take ground you have to putting guy with a rifle man who will kill anybody trying to knock him off that is how you hold territory law enforcement simply is not going to be up to it America is does not have enough cops and the cops that are there are simply not reliable for a leftist here any to use as counter insurgents so we turn out the military let's talk about the military they got there they get there have one tanks and they got their b-1 bombers and they got their you know Minuteman missiles and all these other things and that's not really gonna help now we've seen in Vietnam Iraq and Afghanistan that small groups of people with light weapons can in fact tie a modern military into knots the military has to make you know some choices a it can go all in and essentially kill everybody which is not typically what we do or it can try and fight a counter insurgency which takes a long time and is no sure thing so liberal tyrants are gonna have to face a choice and you know are we gonna really go in there and or we go really clean house or are we just gonna kind of putter around the edges now we'll talk about numbers and things in I'm just I'm grand strategy now if they decide well we're gonna be really rough we're gonna get we're gonna do Sherman's march to the sea part two the quickening here in America well that's that's how we're gonna fight it we're gonna go in you you know your your stupid little village has guerrillas were there no and were to kill everybody burn everything they could do that and that's a technique that a lot of people who've lost insurgencies have done because part of the magic of insurgencies is that the goal of insurgents is to draw a reaction from the counterinsurgency that drives the people into their arms in other words as an insurgent you would want to provoke retaliation that turns the people against the government you would want the government to commit trois ''tis you would come want the government to commit violence that will drive more people to you so that there are problems with that plan and counterinsurgency of course where you going to make friends with the people essentially while fighting the insurgents that has issues too because it takes a long time and it is no certain thing now in the United States let's let's look at the situation this is not a situation where it is just the countryside might have bands of guys with rifles wandering through though don't don't count out guys and pans of guys with rifles wandering the countryside they get they can be very effective this is a multi a multi-level situation in blue areas yeah you would have you would have real you know guerrillas hidden people people who hide but there are whole States that are red you think if there was some sort of civil conflict you think Texas wouldn't just say yeah all of Texas has thrown in with the rebels against leftist tyranny so you actually have active governments that would be for an operating and owning ground owning territory and in the blue areas you would have rebels that would have to be suppressed somehow who are you gonna suppress and what well you know we talked about the cops talk about the military let's talk about numbers right now the unit of action the the basic unit that you use in the military this is something called a Brigade Combat Team BCT usually it's infantry but maybe armored now the numbers vary there's around sixty of them in the army let's get about ten fifteen more for the Marines okay so we're talking about seventy five brigade combat teams some of them are overseas well let's say ten so there's about sixty five a lot of those are reserved by the way the hell you can you get 65 Brigades for 50 states there's about 4500 guns as this varies 4500 guys in every brigade immediately let's let's look at what happens you we have now mobilized military you know for president Hillary Clinton we are going to you know impose our leftist here any first sergeant take roll call Jones Adams Adams Archer Archer not here not here you would have massive desertions because where do most of these guys come from where most people in the military come from it's not the big blue cities Lahm come from the country the use of the military to impose leftist tyranny would be a mission where you're actually pitting brother against brother literally and you know some people actually like their brothers and you would see a huge number of desertions but let's be you know let's be very conservative about it let's say you're only losing maybe 10% 10% from diversion you get 90% of the people actually don't desert okay so now you're 4500 man brigade is about 4,000 folks there's this thing called the fog of war there are these little things that make war difficult little problems that you face one problem is people who are not the ploy about people who are sick injured you know guy breaks his leg on the obstacle course you know another guy comes down with pneumonia cuz he was doing guard duty in the rain every units gonna lose about 10 percent of people off the top for something just some reason you know Uncle Joe died I gotta go home to his funeral another 10% out so now you're about to bow down about 3,500 out of your 4,000 4,500 how many of those guys are actual fighters well we call it the tooth to tail ratio how many people are supporters how many people actually go out and hold rifles and then that ratio is really tilted in the way of the supporters a brigade usually has about seven battalions about three of them are what are called maneuver batons those are the ones that actually fight of those about two-thirds of the guys are actual fighters you're really looking at guys actual holding a gun about let's be super super conservative 1,500 about 1,500 carrying actually carrying guns in a one-time any unit and that's full strength and we've already lost 20% of our people so we're down to twelve hundred people for Brigade Ressa guys are doing support stuff supports have huge a brigade is like a little city I know I was a deputy commander owynn I was acting commander one I took one out to the National Training Center it's like a little city and there's a lot of administrative things and logistical things that go on you got to feed them and fuel them and you got to get them bullets and you got to take the sick ones away and you got lawyers and you got chaplains you got veterinarians you got all these other people who are not out there with rifles who are just making it possible for guys to be out there with rifles so we're really talking for every brigade all 70 of them you're talking about 1200 people who are actual fighters 1200 times 17 da-da-da-dah that's about eighty four thousand guys 84,000 they gotta sleep they got a refit they got a train they have to do things that take them off the street let's be nuts let's say you were going full-speed 12-hour 12-hour shifts you got 42,000 folks at any one time to secure the entire United States of America doesn't sound like a lot maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm wrong my numbers maybe they could do more okay triple and quadruple it make it quintuple it 200,000 people with guns at any one time remember that's five times what I calculated sperm across the United States remember it's not like one guy either military people operate in units usually squad sections you know teams so you're looking no less than five to ten folks at any one time so that indicates there's just not a lot of folks out there to actually pull triggers let's compare the numbers there's 300 million American or 35 million Americans there's at least 300 million guns let's assume 5% of those guys five percent of Americans decide yeah I'm going to participate in this fight so you're talking 15 million Americans let's say at any one time ten percent of them are fighting or willing to fight that's one point five million so with our 200,000 guys it which is like the best best best best best case scenario against 1.5 million not good numbers but wait we got tanks the Army's got tanks well how many tanks do you think the army has how many armored vehicles do you think it is the m1 Abrams is America's main battle tank very effective tank very hard to kill there were 88 hundred of them made probably about 4000 are still in the United States in some place but most of them are in Depaz if you take the brigade combat teams and you calculate it out a brigade combat team that has armor and only about 12 or 13 14 15 of them do have armor there's only about a hundred days less than 100 tanks in a brigade my brigade is less than hundred tanks so you're only talking about maybe 1,500 tanks out there that's almost wow 30 per state the the range of a tanks main gun 120-millimeter cannon is let's cause i'm not going to tell you exactly what it is but say about two thousand thirty thousand meters okay that's what it controls and they operate in groups of two to four that's what it controls are you seeing the problem put all the little tanks down oh and remember only about 75% of them are like operational at any one time so it's really not 1,500 tanks it's really more like 1,100 tanks they're actually able to operate put them around there just simply are not enough tanks to dominate a country like the United States and you know and where would the rule is County you do you think that you know if there were tanks and you said we're gonna send 50 tanks into this area well of course the guerrillas are gonna go away girls don't fight you know tanks not directly you don't fight directly when you're an insurgent you fight indirectly you fight the weak point do you attack the tank with your thirty on six we're hunting rifle no stupid you would you you attack the guy who's driving the fuel truck or the kind who's driving the ammo truck or you wait till the guys get out of the tank to take a leak now I'm not giving away any hints I'm not giving away any secrets here the enemy knows this none of this is new and I'm not advocating any of this stuff I'm just telling you how it is the simple fact is against armed citizens you even using small arms are military even in the best case where I give them every benefit of the doubt he's simply not able to impose its will not effectively not for a long time you see they put a bunch of forces in one place in control for a while but they're just not gonna take over they can't do it America operates on the consent of the governed why because we're armed and we can resist that's a lesson the British it'll learn and I hope we don't go down this road the obstruction we talked about earlier the loss of rights we've seen in Britain these are warning signs these are warning signs that we need to get back to what makes America the greatest country on Earth and that's the fact that we understand that every human being is endowed with inalienable rights by his creator and the and that that led to the Constitution that was the basis of the founders thought process that's why we have the Constitution that we have and that's what we need to get back to that's what we need to honor and if we keep moving away from it it's just gonna get ugly anyway I'm glad you guys had could come and join me for my my weekly rebel media podcast take that with Curt Schlichter I guess I wasn't particularly funny today I prefer to be funny but we had kind of some serious subjects and I hope you found it in lightning look for me here on rebel media every Thursday I appreciate you watching and come find me on Twitter I'm under Curt's lector it's spelled exactly how it sounds and watch for my townhall columns every Monday and Thursday I will see you all next week
