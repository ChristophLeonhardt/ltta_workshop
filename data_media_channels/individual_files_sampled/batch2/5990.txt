he's trying to act like a Republican so he gets he won't give me one vote I hear he's nice-looking I think I'm better looking than him I do I do personally I like Rick Sacco and I think he's answered we need our congressman Ciccone we have to have him we have to have the people of Pittsburgh cannot be conned by this guy Lam you just can't do it I really don't I don't know what to say like this Connor Lam guys good look and then the president says but I think I'm better looking than am I yikes let's bring in right now ed Rendell I mean that's obviously every time ed Rendell campaigned in western Pennsylvania that was his line as well al sharpton is with us along with Chris Hayes Mike Barnicle Heidi and Noah still also in the house Edwin Bell you actually when we were in Philadelphia at the RNC you would predicted a lot at the DNC you had predicted along with Joe Biden that Donald Trump could win and told us off-camera would most likely win Pennsylvania in part because the Clinton campaign wasn't reaching out to white working-class voters in Pennsylvania who were such an important part of Pennsylvania politics but here how bizarre that you've got Donald Trump who only seems to be reaching out for white working-class voters to such a degree that he his candidates lose in places like Alabama and Virginia and my gosh it's gonna be fascinating isn't it as the results come in to see what's happening in the suburbs of Pittsburgh what are you going to be looking at tomorrow night well it's gonna be turnout turnout is going to determine Joe this election obviously there's going to be a greater Democratic turnout in Republican but the question is how much greater if it's significantly greater Connor lambs gonna win if it's not too great margin then Conrad will probably lose but in any event he'll run 1518 points ahead of where Trump ran in 16 and I don't think Trump knows the district very well because there's no voters in Pittsburgh in this district he's talked about talk about though if you will how Republican this district is and how surprising it is that it's still close and what other Republicans in Congress who have to run in 2018 what should they be taking away from the fact that we don't know who's going to win this race today well it's interesting this is a still a pretty good Donald Trump district the Monmouth poll which is a pretty reliable poll showed 51% of the people in the district have a favorable opinion of the president those are very good numbers for Donald Trump and if he can't deliver a candidate in that type of district because the Democratic turnout is so great and the Republican turnout is spirited if he can't deliver then I think it means real trouble right across the board and remember he has a way of minimizing his candidates these try now if you watch that entire press conference I thought he made mr. Sirk own senator secona look small Chris first of all we're gonna get to your Booker calling in a nation out in paperback today national bestseller yes everyone knows that let's be clear talking about the you know Democrats and appealing to the white ethnic working class vote we've been talking about that for months now western Pennsylvania Pennsylvania 18 the Union vote is going to be kind of interesting to watch tonight but the larger question is how does a Democrat go and approach an appeal to that working-class white ethnic vote look I think that you know the the model of this right now in American politics is I would say a senator sherrod Brown of Ohio who is someone whose voting record is in the left turn left third of the caucus of Senate Democrats but who runs 8 to 10 points statewide ahead someone like Donald Trump in Ohio I think he's favored to win that race and he is laser-focused on a bunch of core economic issues he supported the steel tariffs not surprisingly he has been a critic of trade since he was a congressman from Ohio he is incredibly close to organized labor in the state of Ohio but he also isn't you know he doesn't he doesn't pander right I mean he takes tough votes with the Democratic caucus on a whole bunch of social issues on things like abortion on things like LGBT rights etc etc but his emphasis the thing that he talks about the most are economic populist issues things like trade things like banking regulation things like a living wage and it's been effective I mean sherrod Brown is really an interesting case I think he sort of weirdly gets a little under notice to the national level but if anyone has a key if anyone is doing exactly this and keep in mind this is someone whose political career has spanned a real rightward shift of Ohio I mean Ohio which was a sort of archetypal swing state has moved much more than the Republican column and Brown has been able to sort of maintain his whole that's a tough tightrope to walk though for a Democrat I think it's a rope that they're gonna have to walk though no matter how tight and I think that what we're going to really see tomorrow we keep hearing about the erosion of support for President Trump particularly among some of the white women that gave them a vote we're gonna see how real that is no matter what the results are and the enthusiasm level of the Democrats so I think that we have a lot to watch tomorrow no matter how to raise goals because I think Pennsylvania is gonna tell a lot of that story are we really taken for granted a democratic surge or is it really there are we taken for granted that he's base is eroding he being Donald Trump because I think what we saw on Saturday night's rally was a Donald Trump rally Donald Trump does not have the capacity to campaign for anybody it's exactly true so there's no such thing as does he have any coke tear he never lend you his coat governor there seems to be a convergence on the issue of trade now that we have the steel and aluminum tariffs Connor land hasn't exactly said he's again this and the Republican is sort of typically for it so we're all for now these protectionist moves but I want to talk to you about western Pennsylvania we have this conception of western Pennsylvania as this nostalgic area that's focused on its have past as a steel producing town but Pittsburgh has moved on from that a long time ago Pittsburgh is a medical concentr for our innovation and technology and they've I don't really see them having this conception of themselves as a steel town that was and is no more what what does western Pennsylvania think of it's more the outlying areas outside of Pittsburgh there's still coal miners and steel workers and not a lot but a lot of retirees that are in coal miners and steel workers that were steel Meyer Union guys so Pittsburgh itself is a high-tech city now it's a medical city it's Ed's and meds as imagine driving the Pittsburgh arrival and you're right but look on trade I think the Democratic position has to be we're against unfair trade so if you have evidence of a country that's dumping that's a wrongdoer yeah let's put a tariff on them or let's put a quota I testified for quota to be dropped on the Chinese for dumping steel pipe into America Arlen Specter my testified we finally after five years got a quota cart played but across the board tariffs are insane and I think everyone understands that and if they don't understand it now they're gonna understand it by November of eighteen was everything they buy at the store it's gonna go up are you concerned that this could hasten the Democratic Party's move away from organized labor know it's interesting we need a broad-based Democratic Party our progressive wings got understand Connor lambs pro-life that's okay Connor lamb is mild on gun control he's not for banning assault weapons but he's for universal background checks that's okay Connor lamb is endorsed by the Steel Workers Union even though Trump dropped the tariffs Connor Lam is endorsed by the steel workers union so we have to have a broad-based party because what I used to tell people as Connor lamb will cast one vote that's important deal for the next Speaker of the House of we progressives understand and I'm working on Chris but we get there so Chris Hayes of course you've got your book out now in paperback as Mike Barnicle said this is no regional bestseller this is known as a vessel it's an International and a galactic bestseller that has a new afterword and tell us tell us what's new what we're gonna see in the book afterward is actually about you know I wrote the book well while during the election and the election of Donald Trump Trump was only mentioned once in the book it's not about Donald Trump the afterword sort of focus is on particularly the politics of law and order and what the president means when he talks about it and it's a sort of remarkable thing here's a guy who ran on law and order here's a guy whose supporters rail against illegals and illegal immigration and the lawlessness of that who surrounded himself by it can now be said felons we have numerous felons who were in part of the campaign they've all pleaded two federal felonies who events is no concern whatsoever about lawlessness or criminality among the behavior of his associates who had as his staff secretary a man credibly accused of domestic violence including a picture of a Bozz that went into the face of his ex-wife and then whines about due process when the person loses his job this is someone whose vision of what law and order is and is a profoundly tribal one right he doesn't care about the law in general he doesn't care about order in general what he cares about is protecting the people close to him and using the laws of tool against those who are against it nobody I think what's important also about some of the issues you've raised which I've given my life to it's around the criminal justice issue I think that what we're missing while we build all of the salacious stories he has began appointing federal judge interact he has began putting federal prosecutors in that reverse where we had started going on to eight years of President Obama that went all the way back to the beginning of the Qing movement so the whole movement around criminal justice reform has been stalled and slowly being reversed on the Trump and that is significant and devastate and it's true and we've seen we've seen Jeff Sessions even against some of the sort of think tank right you might call it the Koch brothers have funded this writer crime coalition people like Cato and others who have who have advocated for getting rid of mandatory minimums different sentencing guidelines we have seen sessions take the party take the DOJ in the direction old nineteen Cato anothers yeah and now you have the president the United States and Pennsylvania talking about executing drug dealers Chris Hayes
