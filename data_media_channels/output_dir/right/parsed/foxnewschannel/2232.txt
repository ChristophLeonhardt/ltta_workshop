TO GET MY BILL AND LET THE BILL
PASSED.
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
THERE WAS OTHER NEWS TODAY
CONCERNING OUR PRESIDENT.
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO GO INTO
EFFECT IN THE ALUMINUM AND
MAKING COUNTRIES, NOT ONLY
INCLUDING CHINA BUT A HOST OF
OUR OTHER FRIENDS.
WE SCALED THAT BACK AND GAVE A
30 DAY EXTENSION TO THE LIKES OF
THE E.U., CANADA, MEXICO, AND
BRAZIL.
SOUTH KOREA HAD ALREADY'S
SEPARATED FOR ANOTHER AGREEMENT.
THAT HAS HELD OFF FOR 30 DAYS,
AND A REMINDER TO SOME THAT THE
PRESIDENT IS ALSO IMPROVING A
PRAGMATIC OR NEGOTIATING
STRATEGY HERE THAT COULD EVEN
GET CONCESSIONS OUT OF THE
CHINESE.
REBECCA HEINEMAN FROM THE HUDSON
INSTITUTE IS WITH US.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
>> OF THE PRESIDENT IS BEING
EQUITABLY DOMINIC INCREDIBLY
PRAGMATIC.
THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN START
STARVED OF THIS KIND OF
LEADERSHIP.
ALL OF THESE COUNTRIES HAVE ALL
AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO
RECALIBRATE THEIR TRADE
POLICIES, AND TO BE MORE
FAVORABLE TO THE UNITED STATES
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE E.U.,
MEXICO AND CANADA.
THOSE NEGOTIATIONS WILL
CONTINUE.
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID THIS IS
THE LAST TIME THE UNITED STATES
IS EXTENDING THIS.
WE WANT THEM TO MAKE CONCESSIONS
SO THE UNITED STATES HAS A
BETTER POSITION.
>> WHEN WE GO TO THE CHINESE, WE
ARE SENDING OUR AVENGERS, IN THE
ECONOMIC TEAM, IT SEEMS TO ME.
I LOOK AT THE NAMES OF WHO IS
GOING TO CHINA, THEY ARE ALL
GOING THERE AND THE PRESIDENT IS
EAGER FOR THEM TO GET THE WORD
OUT.
WE NEED TARIFFS THAT THE CHINESE
WON'T BEND.
AND THEY WON'T BEND WITH THE
NUMBER TURNING OUR SURPLUS.
NOR ARE THEY GOING TO GET MUCH
GROUND ON HIGH TECHNOLOGY
CONCESSIONS OR ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE OR ANY OF THAT.
SO I'M WONDERING IF EVERYONE IS
GETTING LOCKED IN THEIR
POSITIONS HERE?
>> THIS IS ONLY THE TRUE-THE
REALLY THE ONLY TRADE ISSUE TO,
AND THAT IS CHINA'S HELP WITH
NORTH KOREA SO THAT'S ANOTHER
ANGLE HERE THAT WE HAVE TO
CONSIDER, MORE THAN ANYTHING.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DETERMINED TO
GET CHINA TO NOT PROVIDE
DIPLOMATIC COVER FOR NORTH KOREA
BUT INSTEAD, SIDE WITH THE
UNITED STATES.
THE CHINESE MIGHT BE PLAYING
HARDBALL ON TRADE BECAUSE THEY
KNOW THAT ACTUALLY THE ALLIGATOR
CLOSEST TO THE BOAT IS HELPING
WITH THAT NEGOTIATION TO THE
NORTH KOREANS.
>> SO DOES THAT MEAN PRESIDENT
MIGHT BE MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE OR
AMENABLE, ON THIS NORTH KOREA
THING?
>> IF THAT'S THE CASE, CERTAINLY
THAT'S NOT THE POSITION THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION WILL GO IN WITH.
AND I CERTAINLY KNOW THIS IS A
PRIORITY FOR THE PRESIDENT, BUT
IF THERE IS AN AREA WHERE THE
PRESIDENT MIGHT GIVE A LITTLE
BIT, IT WILL BE WITH CHINA AND I
