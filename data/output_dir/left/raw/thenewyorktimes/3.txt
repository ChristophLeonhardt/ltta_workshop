1
00:00:03,683 --> 00:00:04,183
“Hello.”

2
00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:04,682
“Hey.”

3
00:00:04,682 --> 00:00:06,710
“My hair — I
crimped it, and it

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,762
feels like a [bleep] poodle.

5
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:10,486
It’s really fluffy.”

6
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:11,458
[playing guitar]

7
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:15,346
(singing) “I’m all
right with a slow burn.

8
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:22,715
Taking my time,
let the world turn.”

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:25,580
“The song is definitely one
of my most personal, for sure.”

10
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,428
(singing) “I’m
gonna do it my way.

11
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:29,738
It’ll be all right.

12
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,580
If we burn it down and
it takes all night.”

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,620
“Country songs,
historically, have always

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,016
been about real life;
they’ve been story songs.

15
00:00:37,016 --> 00:00:39,390
That’s what I love the most
about the roots of the genre.

16
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,030
I came up with the chorus
on a spiritual journey,

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,275
so to speak.”

18
00:00:43,275 --> 00:00:43,850
“O.K.”

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,350
“Yeah.

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,340
And I think anything
that, like, puts

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,380
me or any human
outside of their,

22
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,020
like, egotistical
state of living

23
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,180
is a really healthy
thing every now and then

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,263
— in moderation, obviously.”

25
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,425
“Do you mind if I ask if
it was mushrooms or LSD?”

26
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,580
“It was LSD.

27
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,080
Yeah.

28
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,251
[laughs] And I was just
sitting on my front porch

29
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:03,750
thinking.

30
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,300
And I was just like,
man, I love a slow burn.

31
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,900
And I was like, that can apply
to so many areas in my life.

32
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,102
That can apply to,
like, relationships,

33
00:01:11,102 --> 00:01:12,060
you know, a good drink.

34
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,740
You sip on a glass of
wine for a long time.

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,070
You savor it.

36
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,700
You really enjoy,
like, the journey.

37
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,116
You don’t rush to
the finish line.

38
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:19,230
It did open my
mind a little bit

39
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,170
and make me kind of take a
step back and, like, really think

40
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,600
about where I am,
and what I want,

41
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,400
and just kind of
the world around us

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,800
and the crazy time
that we live in.”

43
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,840
“That’s a very acid thought.”

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,560
“Yeah. Yeah.

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,161
It kind of is.”

46
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:35,160
“She had said that she wanted
to do something called

47
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,190
‘Slow Burn.’

48
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,070
I like writing title
first because it can

49
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,690
be that kind of keystone.”

50
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,000
“What mood were you thinking
when you heard the title

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,750
‘Slow Burn’?”

52
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,870
“I guess I kind of imagined
immediately kind of being

53
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,200
out west or somewhere
out near some mountains

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,395
where you could get a
vast sense of landscape.”

55
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:56,400
“Ian and I started to
mess with a little bit

56
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,080
of a backdrop
that you might be

57
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,412
able to paint that
kind of idea across.”

58
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:03,155
“Testing”

59
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:08,178
[guitar]

60
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,511
“What was her
initial reaction?”

61
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,584
“It wasn’t, Oh,
my God, you guys,

62
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,375
this is so amazing.

63
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,530
It was like, Yeah,
that’ll work.

64
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,030
Let’s see what we
can do with that.”

65
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,879
“I felt like,

66
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,420
I don’t know.

67
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,510
It made sense.

68
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,410
It gave me this feeling of,
like, all the old Neil Young

69
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,850
songs that I grew
up listening to.

70
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,250
They were kind of
roaming around the room,

71
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,980
strumming, while I
was trying in my head

72
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,036
the little verses that
I had come up with.”

73
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,160
“She likes to doodle a lot.

74
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,591
So she will
hand-write the lyrics

75
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:37,715
with a lot of people who
are just on their phones.”

76
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:41,343
(singing) “Born in a
hurry, always late.

77
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:43,970
Haven’t been early since ’88.”

78
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,410
“That’s me poking
fun at myself,

79
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,420
because I was born
a month early.

80
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,220
I came on the day of
my mom’s baby shower.

81
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,761
I mean, I always
have loved to party.”

82
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:53,659
(singing) “Good in a
glass, good on green.

83
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,940
Good when you’re puttin’
your hands all over me.”

84
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,170
“That’s talking about a good
drink, or like a good joint,

85
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:00,670
whatever.

86
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,878
That’s in reference to green.”

87
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:04,840
(singing) “I’m all
right with a slow burn.

88
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:13,330
Taking my time, let
the world turn.”

89
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:16,780
“I had a pretty complex idea
of an arrangement, just kind

90
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,620
of some interweaving slightly
Eastern-sounding feelings.”

91
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,550
“I was playing the bass,

92
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,930
and I was just
playing some sort

93
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,340
of spaceship kind of licks.

94
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,010
And then later, we
added some strings,

95
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,440
where there’s a bit of, like,
almost an Indian motif.

96
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,410
I like anything
that sounds Asian.

97
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:42,334
I like that.”

98
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,000
“I just wanted to
feel like it opened up

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
into canyon-scape images.”

100
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,050
“I do remember thinking, Well,
I think that’s pretty good.

101
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,990
But you don’t know how other
people are going to react.”

102
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:59,600
“I was like, it just feels
like it’s trying too hard.

103
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,530
Let’s, like, delete, like,
literally half of them.

104
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,835
I like going, O.K.,
erase, erase, erase.

105
00:04:03,835 --> 00:04:05,710
I didn’t want people to
listen to this record

106
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:06,940
and be like, O.K.,
where is she?

107
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,010
Like, she just got weird for
the hell of it, you know.”

108
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,720
“She would let us put
a lot on the table,

109
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,960
and then she would remove
as it felt necessary.”

110
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,321
“That has earned the nickname
the Ax Man in studio.

111
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,029
They’d be, like, playing
a part, and they’d

112
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,619
be like, ‘Doesn’t
matter anyway,

113
00:04:20,619 --> 00:04:22,410
she’s just going to
come in and delete it.’”

114
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,110
“You know, I’ll be honest.

115
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,390
There were some things I
was hoping would make it

116
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,050
but didn’t.”

117
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,780
“Like, sorry.

118
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,720
I have to:

119
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,324
It’s a [bleep] slow burn!”

120
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:30,180
(singing) “It’s a slow burn.

121
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,138
You know the bar
down the street

122
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:39,126
don’t close for an hour.

123
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:43,600
We should take a walk and
look at all the flowers.”

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,610
“My husband just pointed
out the other day,

125
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,604
you say the sun’s going down.

126
00:04:47,604 --> 00:04:50,020
And then in the next line, you
say the bar down the street

127
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,070
don’t close for an hour.

128
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,067
He’s like, wouldn’t
it be like way later

129
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,400
if they were
closing in an hour?

130
00:04:54,400 --> 00:00:00,000
I was like, It ain’t
supposed to be literal.”
