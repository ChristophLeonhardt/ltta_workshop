I lost my job
and all my benefits completely.
They're literally
saving my life.
Until you've lost your health,
you don't know how
much you've lost.
I'd like to think that there's
a way to provide health care
to the millions of the people
in this country that don't have
the care that they need.
We're not a solution to the
Affordable Care Act or whatever
the next Affordable Care Act
is going to be.
I see in places like Kentucky
and Tennessee and Appalachia,
where you have large
numbers of people that
voted for the new
administration,
they're all expecting that
something good
is going to happen.
I really hope that it does.
