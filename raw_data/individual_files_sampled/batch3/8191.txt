WELCOME BACK. WELL A NEW POLL REVEALING AMERICANS ARE BECOMING MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NORTH KOREA GIVING UP ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS. FOLLOWING THE PRESIDENT'S SUMMIT. LAST WEEK 41% NOW SAY IT'S LIKELY UP FROM 30% IN APRIL. HERE TO REACT, FORMER GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR MIKE HUCKABEE. HAPPY FATHER'S DAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE TELL YOUR DAD HAPPY FATHER'S DAY FROM AN OLD FRIEND, AND I MEAN OLD FRIEND. I WILL. YOU BOTH ARE GREAT MEN. BOTH OF YOUR DAUGHTERS, MYSELF AND YOURS ARE LUCKY TO HAVE YOU IN OUR LIVES. I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THE WAY THE COUNTRY IS FEELING ABOUT NORTH KOREA. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IN THE MEDIA AND HOW MUCH OF AMERICA FEELS AND HOW OPTIMISTIC THEY ARE ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND DEALING WITH NORTH KOREA. YOU LOOK AT THE POLL NUMBERS. PEOPLE SEEM LIKE WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE RIGHT NOW HOPING FOR THE BEST. WELL IT'S CERTAINLY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. AND I THINK THE FACT IS PEOPLE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN NORTH KOREA. THEY SAW THE DIFFERENCE OF KIM K THEY SAW THE DIFFERENCE OF KIM M JONG-UN'S ATTITUDE OF STOPPING THE TESTS THAT HAD BEEN GOING ON. AND THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT WAS HISTORIC IN THAT IT BROUGHT THE TWO SIDES TOGETHER. I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. NORTH KOREA IS NOT GOING TO HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN THE FUTURE. THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM UP ONE OR TWO WAYS. THEY'RE E VERY GOING TO VOLUNTEERLY VOLUNTARRLY VOLUNTARILY GIVE THEM UP OR THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM TAKEN AWAY. I BELIEVE THEY DO UNDERSTAND, DONALD TRUMP IS NOT BARACK OBAMA, GEORGE BUSH OR BILL CLINTON. AND HE'S NOT GOING TO JUST SAY, OKAY, WE MADE A DEAL, YOU DIDN'T KEEP IT. NOTHING HAPPENS. I THINK SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN AND KIM JONG-UN UNDERSTANDS THAT IF HE WANTS TO CONTINUE TO BE THE LEADER OF NORTH KOREA, HE GIVES UP NUCLEAR WEAPONS. IF HE DOESN'T GIVE THEM UP, THEY'LL BE TAKEN FROM HIM AND IT WILL NOT BE PRETTY. GOVERNOR, ANY CONCERN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GETTING AHEAD OF ITSELF, THAT THEY HAVEN'T YOU KNOW, TAKE THE STEPS TO DENUCLEARIZE, THE RHETORIC IS SAYING HEY THEY'RE GOING TO. ANY CONCERN THERE OR ARE THE LEADERS STRONG ENOUGH THEY'LL MAKE SURE THAT WE FOLLOW THROUGH? I'VE SEAN DONALD I'VE SAIN DONALD I'VE SAID DONALD I'VE SAID TONALD I'VE SAID THAALD I'VE SAID THATLD I'VE SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS PLAYED THIS DIFFERENTLY THAN ANYONE ELSE. HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE. HIS IS SO FAR WORKING BETTER THAN ALL OF THE CONVENTIONAL AND TRADITIONAL APPROACHES. LET'S LET THIS PLAY OUT. AND HE HAS PROVEN TIME AND AGAIN TO BE RIGHT WHEN EVERYONE, EVEN THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM THOUGHT HE WAS WRONG. SO ONE THING WE ARE SEEING IS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DECIDED TO THROW CONVENTION OUT THE WINDOW, NOT JUST DO THE THINGS THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DONE, WHICH HAVE BEEN INE TECH BEEN INEFFECH BEEN INEFFECTIVE. WHICH THAT IS THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY. HAVE YOU HEARD FROM A PARTICULAR PRESS SECRETARY OF THIS FATHER'S DAY? I'M SURE I WILL, BUT I'M GUESSING LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY. NOW THAT I'M SHAMING HER ON NATIONAL TELEVISION, I'M PRETTY SURE I WILL HEAR FROM HER AT SOME POINT. IT'S EARLY. WE'LL GIVE HER A MULLIGAN ON THAT ONE. I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE HER A LITTLE LIT OF SLACK. BUT IF I DON'T HEAR FROM HER IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS I'LL BE
