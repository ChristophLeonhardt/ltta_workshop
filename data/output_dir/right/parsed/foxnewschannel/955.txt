WHERE HE HAS HIS TRUE POWER AS
WE HEAD INTO THE MID-TERM
ELECTIONS.
>> Neil: THANKS, CHAD.
SHOE SHOULD DEMOCRATS BE WORRIED
ABOUT THIS?
THE PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN AT
LEAST NINE CANDIDATES WHO HE
DEEMED WORTH SUPPORTING ELECTED
OR NOMINATED.
LET’S GO TO ASHLEY PRATT,
DEMOCRAT STRATEGIST RICHARD
GOODSTEIN AND CRTV HOST, ALLIE
STUCKEY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, ALLIE?
>> WELL, I THINK THIS IS A VERY
INTERESTING CASE, ESPECIALLY AS
THE ONE THAT WE’RE SEEING IN
SOUTH CAROLINA.
WE HAVE SOMEONE THAT VOTED WITH
TRUMP THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME,
76%.
BUT LIKE THE MONOLOGUE SAID, HE
WAS VERY DEFENSIVE.
HIS CRITICISM OF DONALD TRUMP
AND MAYBE NOT VOTING WITH TRUMP
AS MUCH AS HE ORIGINALLY
THOUGHT.
I THINK ARRINGTON CAPITALIZED ON
THAT AS WELL AS HIS PAST
SCANDALS TO SAY HE DIDN’T JUST
CHEAT ON HIS WIFE, HE CHEATED ON
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
WHETHER OR NOT YOU LIKE WHAT
LARGELY STOCK DEAL.
WE’RE ON THAT.
I WOULD BE REMISS IF I WAITED A
MINUTE MORE DELAYING THAT TO
YOU.
RICHARD, LET’S GO BACK TO THE
BACKDROP FOR THESE DEALS HERE.
THIS ECONOMY AND THINGS PICKING
UP SPEED AND THIS NOTION THIS IS
A GREAT ENVIRONMENT.
NOT BEING MISSED IN POLLS, NOT
BEING MISSED IN NUMBERS.
MAYBE NOT BEING MISSED BY
AVERAGE AMERICANS THAT MIGHT
TAKE FROM DEMOCRATS THAT
SO-CALLED BLUE WAVE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> NEIL, I HOPE YOU GET YOUR
FAIR SHARE OF THAT $65 BILLION
OR WHATEVER THE ANYBODY IS.
LOOK, THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN A
BIND.
YES, YOU HAVE TO TOW THE TRUMP
LINE OR YOU RUN THE RISK OF
GOING AWAY LIKE MARK SANFORD.
ON THE OTHER HAND, ASK RICK
SACCONE, ASK ROY MOORE WHO LOST
TO DOUG JONES HOW MUCH DONALD
TRUMP DOES FOR YOU IN A GENERAL
ELECTION WHEN THERE’S DEMOCRATS
AND INDEPENDENTS VOTING, NOT
JUST PEOPLE THAT ARE SMITTEN
WITH DONALD TRUMP.
>> Neil: YOU’RE RIGHT.
THEY’RE MORE THE EXCEPTION THAN
THE RULE.
YOU CAN GO WITH COREY STEWART
AND LOU BARLETTA IN WEST
VIRGINIA.
THERE’S MANY POSITIONS,
GOVERNOR, SENATE, HOUSE, IT’S
UNMISTAKABLE THAT THE PRESIDENT
CARRIES SOME WEIGHT AND
INFLUENCE IN THESE ELECTIONS.
>> IN A PRIMARY, YES.
ASK BARBARA COMSTOCK.
SHE WON A PRIMARY AGAINST A
FRINGE RIGHT WING CANDIDATE THAT
SAID SHE WASN’T CONSERVATIVE
ENOUGH IN A DISTRICT THAT
HILLARY WON BY 20% IN 2016.
AND COREY --
>> Neil: NO, I’M NOT HERE TO
ARGUE POLITICS WITH YOU.
I DON’T CARE.
I LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND
TRENDS.
I’VE SEEN AND SAY IT’S BETTER IF
YOU’RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE TO
HAVE HIS BLESSING AND HE HAS
YOURS, RIGHT?
>> ONLY IN A PRIMARY.
>> THAT’S THE POWER OF TWITTER.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.
CARETY ARRINGTON YESTERDAY
GETTING THE SUPPORT AROUND
4:00 P.M. WAS A HUGE BOOST FOR
HER, ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE
SOUTH CAROLINA WHERE HE WAS
WIDELY POPULAR DURING THE
PRIMARY HE WON THERE IN 2016.
SO I THINK AGAIN, IT DEPENDS ON
THE STATE.
MOVING FORWARD, I DON’T THINK
DEMOCRATS WILL SPEND TIME IN
STATES LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA.
THEY’RE GOING TO BE GOING FOR
STATES THAT CAN SWING, THAT ARE
PURPLE.
TRUMP’S SUPPORT MAY NOT BE THAT
HELPFUL.
IF YOU’RE ON THE REPUBLICAN
TICKET AND YOU WANT HIS SUPPORT,
IT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL THAN
GETTING TWEETED AGAINST YOU,
WHICH WE HAVE SEEN THAT WORK
AGAINST PEOPLE IN THE PAST
WORKING ON THE REPUBLICAN
TICKET.
AT THE END OF THE DAY IN CLOSE
RACES WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE
WILLING TO SPEND MONEY, THOSE
REPUBLICANS ARE IN JEOPARDY
SUPPORTED BY THE PRESIDENT.
THIS WILL BE AGAIN, A VERY
ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
GOING TO THE MID-TERM.
>> Neil: AND I THINK RICHARD
WOULD AGREE.
BUT ALLIE, I’LL ASK YOU FIRST.
IT’S THE ECONOMY.
INVARIABLY IT’S THE ECONOMY.
I’M NOT SAYING OTHER EVENTS WHEN
IT COMES TO CONTROVERSIAL
CHARACTER THAT THEY WEIGH ON
PEOPLE.
BUT WITH THE ECONOMY PICKING UP,
MARKETS PICKING UP, NOT THAT
EVERY ONE PARTICIPATES IN THE
BIG MERGERS OR OTHERWISE, THIS
FRENETIC ACTIVITY THAT HAS
CLEARLY PICKED UP IS TO
REPUBLICAN’S BENEFIT FOR THE
TIME BEING.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> EXACTLY.
BECAUSE IT BENEFITS THEM
IMMEDIATELY.
THERE’S INSTANT GRATIFICATION.
THEY CAN FEEL THE MONEY IN THEIR
POCKET OR SEE THE MONEY IN THEIR
BANK ACCOUNT.
IT AFFECTS THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES.
NORTH KOREA, GREAT.
GETTING TOUGH ON IMMIGRATION,
GREAT.
IT MIGHT NOT EFFECT SOMEONE’S
LIFE OR PAYCHECK IN THE WAY THAT
ECONOMIC ISSUES DO.
THEY SEE THE ECONOMY BOOMING AND
HOPEFULLY TARIFFS DON’T REVERSE
THAT.
BUT FOR NOW, THE ECONOMY IS
DOING WELL AND HARD FOR PEOPLE
TO VOTE AGAINST THEIR POCKET
BOOKS.
THAT’S WHAT WE’RE SEEING WITH
THESE CANDIDATES.
>> WHILE IT MAY BE ABOUT THE
ECONOMY AND THAT’S WHAT WILL
TURN OUT THE VOTE IN NOVEMBER,
THE IMPORTANT THING TO REMEMBER
HERE IS THAT IT IS A MID-TERM
ELECTION WITH A REPUBLICAN
MAJORITY.
SO THAT DOES MEAN THAT THIS TIDE
WILL POTENTIALLY GO AGAINST
REPUBLICANS.
>> Neil: I DON’T DOUBT IT WILL.
HERE’S WHERE MY --
>> IT COULD HELPFUL OR MAY NOT
BE.
>> Neil: AND MY PREDICTIONS
COULD BE WRONG.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THE REPUBLICANS
WILL LOSE SEATS IN THE HOUSE.
I DON’T THINK THAT’S LOSE 23.
LOSE ENOUGH TO TIP THE HOUSE
SEAT THE OTHER WAY.
RICHARD?
>> SO THE FACTS OF THE ECONOMY
IS DOING AS WELL AS IT IS AND
THE GENERIC BALLOT IN FOX NEWS
POLL HAS DEMOCRATS UP BY NINE.
HAS THE PRESIDENT IN THE LOW
40s.
THAT’S SHOCKING.
>> Neil: YOU THINK THE BASIC
DYNAMICS HAVEN’T CHANGED MUCH.
>> WE’RE SEEING NO EVIDENCE IN
THE POLLS.
PEOPLE CAN QUIBBLE WHETHER THE
POLLS --
>> Neil: YOU’RE RIGHT.
THEY BOUNCE AROUND.
BUT MY THOUGHT ON THAT IS YOU
NEED FOR HOUSE OR SENATE TO
CHANGE OR THE -- TO BE SOMETHING
THAT IS A SHIFT OF THAT -- YOU
NEED A LOT OF ANGER, NOT JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF ANGER OUT THERE.
>> I THINK AGAIN, IF THE GENERIC
HOLDS AND IT’S 9 OR THERE ABOUTS
WHERE THE FOX NEWS POLL IS NOW,
THAT’S WAVE STUFF.
YOU’RE SEEING LIKE IN THAT
ARIZONA SPECIAL ELECTION IN
APRIL, TRUMP WINS BY 21.
THE REPUBLICAN WINNING THE HOUSE
RACE BY FIVE.
EVERY REPUBLICAN --
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
