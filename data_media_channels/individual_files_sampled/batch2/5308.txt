NBC News has learned that Iranian hackers have laid the groundwork to carry out extensive cyber attacks against US and European companies and infrastructure here at home the US has warning allies and weighing a counter attack according to three senior officials joining me now sir peter Westmacott the former british ambassador to the US ambassador Wendy Sherman former Undersecretary of State for political affairs who served as a member of the u.s. negotiating team with North Korea and of course negotiated the Iran nuclear deal and NBC News national security and military reporter Courtney Kubiak's who broke the story since I'm losing my voice go home tell us we're not talking about an imminent threat we're talking about warnings tell us about the Iranian Iranian capability exactly so Iran has been laying the groundwork for potential attack against a couple of thousand individual targets now these are targets that include critical infrastructure here in the United States it also includes some private industries including healthcare companies technical car technology companies and that includes some US allies in Western Europe and across parts of part of cross parts of the Middle East so the United States has reached out to some of these allies to let them know and the US has been hardening some of their cyber infrastructure to prepare as we should say of course I'm Andrea is it's it's not imminent but they are laying the groundwork should there be some sort of catalyst for a need for them to feel like they needed to respond answer Peter this comes as the State Department has sent letters to the European the big three allies Germany the UK France telling them their companies are not going to be exempt from the sanctions that are being reimpose Don Iran as a result of the u.s. getting out of the Iran nuclear deal that is right and this is one of the many reasons why the main European countries were very much opposed to the idea of the president drum walking away from and potentially killing the nuclear deal with Iran irrespective of Iran's bad behavior in the region and elsewhere the nuclear deal addressed nuclear issues and so walking away from that we think was dangerous and one of the implications is that there may well be this extraterritorial effect on European companies banks and everybody else wants to do business with Iran as a result of continuing and fresh us sanctions this risks being a serious bone of contention I think between Washington and European capitals and meanwhile inevitably as the questions arise about whether the nuclear deal will survive the Iranians as you would expect whether it's in cybersecurity whether it's in threatening to restart the manufacture of centrifuges they are putting in place the necessary things that they will need to do if the deal collapses and if they decide for their own reasons that they want to go back to the bad old days before the nuclear deal was concluded hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
