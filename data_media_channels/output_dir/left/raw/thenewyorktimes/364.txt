1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220


2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,170
The United Nations General
Assembly is basically 193

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,780
countries gathered together.

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,700
They meet continually, all year.

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,710
But this time of year is
basically a summit meeting

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:21,620
of their top leaders or senior
representatives that they send.

7
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,230
It is still the preeminent place
for diplomacy and the biggest

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,330
single place where it happens.

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,270
Trump is the newest thing.

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,520
This will be the first time that
President Trump is in a venue

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,840
with representatives of
so many other countries.

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,300
It's the most prominent place
for diplomacy in the world.

13
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,140
He's certainly socialized
with other leaders,

14
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,720
but never on the
scale like this.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,960
Our withdrawal from the
agreement represents

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,080
a reassertion of
America's sovereignty.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,220
This will be the
first time where Mr.

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,100
Trump and the proponents
of the climate agreement,

19
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,300
including the Secretary
General of the United Nations,

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,540
are in the same place where
this issue will be discussed.

21
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,230
It also comes against a backdrop
of these extreme weather events

22
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:26,340
that we've seen in Texas, and
Florida, and the Caribbean,

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,050
that some have linked
to climate change.

24
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,680
And that's created another
emotional undercurrent

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,810
to the debate.

26
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,100
A ballistic missile
launch failing just--

27
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,780
The North Koreans are on a
path to attain the capability

28
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,040
to strike the United States with
a ballistic missile that has

29
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,860
a nuclear warhead on it.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,910
There is every expectation that
they will continue to do that

31
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,740
until they reach that point.

32
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,030
It's a crisis.

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,110
Of course, President Trump has
threatened North Korea in ways

34
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,310
that we hadn't seen
other leaders do,

35
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,610
and that's elevated tensions.

36
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,130
It's probably the
most serious thing,

37
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,280
from a conflict point of view,
that's confronting the United

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,370
Nations this year at
the General Assembly.

39
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,460
We're absolutely reducing
funding to the UN

40
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,240
and to the various
foreign aid programs,

41
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,660
including those run by
the UN and other agencies.

42
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,940
The Trump administration has
signaled that it wants to cut

43
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,000
its funding to a lot
of things overseas,

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,630
including what the United
Nations does in many parts

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,410
of the world.

46
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,290
The United States is the biggest
single contributor to the two

47
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,220
UN budgets--

48
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,560
the regular budget and
the peacekeeping budget.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,950
And that hasn't changed.

50
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,560
We don't know a lot about what
else may be cut at the United

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,310
Nations because of US
voluntary contributions.

52
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,580
Trump has said-- he's said
insulting things about the UN.

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,460
He's called it a club for
elitists who sit around

54
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,850
and have a good time.

55
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,490
But at the same time, he's shown
a lot of respect for the UN.

56
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,270
Clearly he wants to make a
good impression at the UN.

57
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,450
That's interesting.

58
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,390
We want to see what
he says and does,

59
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,620
and how other leaders
respond to that.

60
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,850
So that, to me, is one reason
why this General Assembly will

61
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,670
stand out, because of Mr Trump.

62
00:03:23,670 --> 00:00:00,000
[APPLAUSE]
