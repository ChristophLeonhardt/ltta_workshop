President Barack Obama has been working on his farewell address to the nation dictating the text to his personal secretary Lola Vavoom in a dramatic exclusive we here at the Andrew Clavin show have obtained a copy of the first draft of this speech thanks to a relationship with Miss Vavoom that is not at all what my wife thinks it is depending on what the meaning of is is or what the meaning of meaning is or whether I can climb out of Lola's window before my wife's private detective breaks in here then is an exclusive look at the first draft of Obama's farewell remarks giving us an insight into how he's assembling his thoughts for his final speech as president quoting now from the document my fellow Americans you lousy sob s what do you mean I can't call them sob z' look what they did to me Lola they've ruined everything they've turned me into a punchline of a bad joke what's black and white and red all over my face that's what now that this nation of Bible clinging idiots has humiliated me by electing some orange haired gorilla to disassemble all of my beautiful achievements dammit stop crying Lola I can't think with all that blubbering going on just pour me another drink and shut the hell up for once now where was I oh yes after everything I did for these lousy gun-toting rubes Obamacare what was that chopped liver I mean I'm not sure exactly what was in it but it was like free medicine or something I give people free medicine and all I hear for eight years as you said we could keep our doctor and now we can't keep our doctor well boohoo play me the world's smallest violin idiots and what about that Paris climate thingamajig whatever they tell me that baby will keep the sun shining for another thousand years at least could Donald Trump do that hey bring back that bottle Lola I'm still the president dammit and if I want a drink I will why shouldn't I drink I was going to be Lincoln I was going to be FDR didn't you see the pictures of me in the magazines dressing me up as great presidents I won the Nobel Prize for crying out loud now what am i a failed palooka with a one-way ticket to nowhere Hilary would have made me head of the UN that's practically black pink king of the world it dad I'm going to grow old giving - highfalutin speeches - frosty haired old dowager's about how articulate I am for a black man plus I'm stuck with Michelle Michelle doesn't understand me not like you understand me Lola now give me that damn bottle alright alright I'll finish my farewell speech first farewell America and screw you you suck love Barack how's that now give me another drink unquote guessing that the president is still working on a second draft trigger warning I'm a true Clavin and this is the extra Clavin Joe alright that was totally our producer JK's I used to have something blocking him from my eye line now and he cracks up he cracks me up it's mailbag day yeah you know we will - I have some questions already in and we will take live questions so if you send live questions while we're doing the mailbag you can I will try and answer them with question with answers are a hundred percent guaranteed correct but only if you subscribe that's right you got to subscribe and will happen after we cut you off ruthlessly from Facebook and YouTube so it's in the second half of the show so you got to stick around for that it's only a lousy eight bucks a month and for that you get me get Shapiro we I think we come and clean your car and stuff like that it's great today also is st. Andrew's Day did you know it's the same yes and it's no coincidence that it's also the last sale day for my memoir the great good thing a secular Jew comes to faith in Christ for one more day it is on sale as an e-book for three bucks but if you spend the whole thing and get it as a real book and give it to someone for Christmas which makes a great Christmas gift it's not it can't be a coincidence that it's also st. Andrews that's probably a coincidence right so Donald Trump I've been thinking about this a lot Donald Trump tweeted today sent out a series of tweets I will be holding a major news conference in New York City with my children on December 15th to discuss the fact that I will be leaving my great business in total in order to fully focus on running the country in order to in all caps make America great again while I am NOT mandated to do this under the law I feel it is visually important as president to in no way have a conflict of interest with my various businesses hence legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations the presidency is a far more important task that was his series of tweets now this has been this is actually very important I think this is the first thing that has happened in a while besides the actual appointments there's been a lot of fuss about every little thing but this is actually important he's not saying how he's gonna do it he's not saying if it's gonna be a blind trust if his children run it it's still gonna be problems for him but this is a thing that is going to be used against him whether he is doing the wrong thing or not to slow down his agenda everything he does is gonna be well did he you know did he break the law that he breaks some ethical things you know Judge Napolitano the legal expert on Fox was talking to megyn kelly about this and this was his judgement of it as a legal matter the problem for president elect Trump is a political one and not a legal one the reason it's not a legal one is that all the ethics rules that the Congress has written and his predecessors have signed into office regulating everybody that works for the federal government have two exceptions to them the vice president and the president so none of the rules that govern everyone else govern him stated differently he can lawfully run the executive branch of the federal government and operate his businesses at the same time he can engage in dealing which appears to be a conflict of interest and again the remedy is political it's not legal look he can't break the law he can't accept payments from foreign governments in order to confer benefits on them and even as wildest critics have not accused him of that but he if he if he toes the line can probably do what he says he's gonna do be a good businessman and be a great president at the same time but what the judge is saying is that the remand when he says the remedies are political that means constant investigations every decision he makes did it help him is he did he do it for the money and was he taking emoluments you know the whole the whole thing is just going to slow him down and of course there's a danger that the nation sinks into kleptocracy I mean review the idea that thieves are running the government solely to make a profit like they do in Russia basically so this is important to me personally because I am constantly watching this president-elect to see how I feel about it I was a guy who really did not like Donald Trump I do not like the way he behaved during the primaries I didn't like the bullying a little Marco stuff I know that stuff was funny and you know appealing to a lot of people but it really bugged me I don't like people who treat other people like that I don't like a president who did it even worse were some of the that some of the conspiracy thing even the thing about you know Rock Obama's Kenyan birth certificate that was funny too because but Obama it was kind of trolling the right with it and Trump trolled him back and that was kind of funny but when he did this stuff about Ted Cruz's father you know why was he this why did he know Lee Harvey Oswald whatever the hell it was from The Enquirer it really it really made me feel like cactus guy has no morals there's no nothing containing him at the same time at the same time I really did understand what the people saw in him because the left has bullied the people so long the left I mean this is this is a country in which large swathes of the manufacturing base have disappeared alone over other countries people are out of work people are on meth people's kids are on meth people don't work and they don't want to work because they've got enough welfare and they sit around and play video games and it's like a country where there's deep deep problems and meanwhile the President of the United States is talking about transgender kids in which bathroom they can use and you're sitting there thinking like what are you talking you know they're doing all this stuff about fake news I you know I hammered the the news media all the time because I think it's a much much much bigger problem than even the people who attack it do I mean the news media the the mainstream media and it's bias is jet fuel to people like Rush Limbaugh there wouldn't be a Rush Limbaugh if you didn't have them to debunk all the time but it really does skew it is like constant constant bullying and it's skews people by not telling them the truth I just found this Christian I'm a poor journalist it was one of these the most biased journalists in the country and she gets so upset when anybody calls for bias what do you mean your ayah pardon me here she is giving a speech about climate change listen to what she says we cannot continue the old paradigm we cannot for instance keep saying like it was over global warming when 99.9 percent of the science the empirical facts the evidence is given equal play with the tiny minority of deniers I learned a long long time ago when I was covering the genocide and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia never to a victim and aggressor never to create a false moral or factual equivalence because then if you do particularly in situations like that you are party and accomplice to the most unspeakable crimes and consequences so those of us who oppose I mean this is a journalist right telling telling people that no you cannot be unbiased you cannot be objective and give play to those of us who think for instance I think the world is getting warmer it seems the evidence it hasn't for the last 15 16 years or so but it has been getting warmer but it's gotten warm before or after all the great lakes used to be glaciers you know I mean where was where was Christiane Amanpour then to save us you know from having Great Lakes the world gets warmer and colder what those of us who don't who think this is a lot of malarkey are suspicious about is a series of policies that simply enacts the power the deepest desires the shopping list of the left with no promise of changing anything about global warming none no signs there is no science that shows that anything they want to do the taking over the taxing on carbon on fossil based fuels that you know the government control over our energy business it's all just the left doing its thing to redistribute wealth to hobble wealthy countries that have gotten wealthy through an industry and capitalism and to give that money to to throw it down the pit of countries that have not become wealthy because they don't have capitalism because they don't have democracy they don't have the industries that make countries rich most people are poor throughout history that's the that is the historical truth it's the India it's the rare free country and free culture that becomes wealthy so so we have these people bullying us you know if you don't like transgender a boy and a dress and your little girl's bathroom you're a hater if you are against global warming you're as bad as the genocide old killers you know and basically I feel the people said you want to bully us we got a bully for you you know I mean they could have gone with Ted Cruz who actually was a revolutionary right winger they didn't they with this guy and I have a lot of respect you know the thing about the presidency the president only one guy the presidency is not about the commentary it's not about me it's not about whether I'm happy it's not about whether I feel good about myself it's about whether the people are better off and freer and able to become prosperous if they have the opportunity to become prosperous so my question now asking myself is a guy who didn't like Trump and who was watching him very carefully is how's he doing and I have to admit kleptocracy is one of my fears with with him that he doesn't have the kind of moral framework to not do it so I'm really happy to hear at least what he's saying so far and I'm gonna watch and see how it develops it doesn't bother me it does not bother me anyway look I got to be honest it didn't bother me that Clinton was having an affair with Monica Lewinsky if I was married to Hillary Clinton I'd be having an affair as well you know it bothered me that he was using the Oval Office but you know that's that's another matter all-together I'm not the president's daddy you know I'm not here to make sure that he's a nice guy like jerk who helps the people is absolutely fine with me so if the ambassador from Sven Juan diya comes to visit the president and feels it would be good for him to stay at the Trump Hotel I don't care I really don't care but if the decisions that he makes are guided and generated by whether he makes a profit I very much do care that is the way for a nation to collapse that's the way nations fall with that kind of corruption at the head of it so the fact that he's not doing that is really good to me it is really a good sign to me I loved his appointments I'm really happy with his appointments and I kind of like what he's doing to the media you know that media has been doing this whole thing about fake news fake news and fake news is basically a way of shutting me up it's um it's you know they've declared The Daily wire when one lists to clear the Daily wire a fake news site the Washington free beacon did a supercut of fake news I love this let's let's just take a listen to some fake news and when I say fake news I mean stories that are designed to trick people into believing lies let's be clear Donald Trump will lose the election right now Donald Trump will I mean if you look at the battleground states right now if Donald Trump's gonna lose that's is different what Donald Trump's doing it's sinister it reeks of Joe McCarthy Texas is still competitive scientists would say at this point nothing better than a Citibank said if Trump selected the market will go down three to five percent if Donald Trump wins the election the stock market will take me and that would hurt the stock market proper to win you know the stock stock market would go down you know one of the pillars of the infamous blue wall about if she can hold there that's a key part of that blue wall I'm clearly going after that blue wall it's whether Hillary Clinton gonna win by small margin or whether we're going to essentially annihilate Donald Trump I think Hillary win and most analysts are saying that Hillary Clinton's gonna win in a landslide they'll think it's likely the Ellery Clinton will win 38 or 40 percent of people roughly speaking are going to have voted for Trump and if Donald Trump does lose particularly if he loses in the face of a massive turnout from Latino communities but there's an invisible surge with Latinos the surge of the Latino vote that that's going to be enough surge in Hispanic Latino voting this is the number right here we're all going to be talking about after the election it is the Hispanic vote but the surge of Latino voters African American voters and Hispanic voters in college-educated white women especially are coming out in droves he claims that the media is lying and that it's reporting cannot be believed so Donald Trump will lose their the most basic pure form of fake news see this is the thing you know I don't want to die in the cause of schadenfreude I don't want to die just laughing at the left well while Donald Trump does something terrible you know on our side that doesn't help me at all doesn't help the country at all we need a free press we need a free press we need a press to to Harry the the President to speak truth to power we don't have that press we don't have that press the press we have is the enemy of freedom and all Democrat all dishonest press is the enemy of freedom and so when I see Donald Trump sent out a tweet about burning the flag and the press goes nuts over it to me what Trump is doing I think what Trump is doing when he says oh if you burn the flag you should lose your citizenship total nonsense but he's taught to what I think he's doing is he's talking like a guy in a bar you know he's talking like me in a bar you burn the flag I should lose your citizenship you know he's gonna have to rein some of that because he's gonna be president but still watching the Prescotts over it is fun hey we got to say goodbye to our friends on Facebook and YouTube but come on over to the daily wire and if you subscribe you can be part of the mailbag we will change your life and boy does it need change
