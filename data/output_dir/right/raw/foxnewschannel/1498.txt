1
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:18,095
>> HIS PARENTS ASKED HIM TO

2
00:00:18,095 --> 00:00:20,230
LEAVE FIVE TIMES, GAVE HIM A

3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,599
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FIND A

4
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:24,801
PLACE, BUT HE DIDN'T TAKE THE

5
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,369
HINT.

6
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:26,937
SO THEY WENT TO COURT.

7
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,406
THE MAN CHILD CLAIMS HE

8
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:31,274
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE BECAUSE

9
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:32,876
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE.

10
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:33,176
WATCH.

11
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:35,178
>> I'M NOT A BURDEN TO THEM IN

12
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:36,279
THE HOME.

13
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,081
THEY DON'T PROVIDE LAUNDRY OR

14
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:38,749
FOOD.

15
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:44,020
IT'S REALLY A MOOT POINT FOR

16
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,174
THEM TO SEEK ME TO BE OBJECTIVE.

17
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:52,362
WE ARE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT

18
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:53,663
SHE THOUGHT.

19
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:56,633
SHE JOINS US TONIGHT.

20
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,101
HE'S 30 YEARS OLD.

21
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,303
HE DOESN'T WANT TO LEAVE.

22
00:01:00,303 --> 00:01:02,439
SHOULD HE BE FORCED TO LEAVE?

23
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:04,708
>> WHY?

24
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:09,446
A THIRD OF 35-YEAR-OLDS LIVE

25
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:11,515
WITH THEIR PARENTS IN THIS

26
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:11,848
COUNTRY.

27
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:15,419
HE WANTS TO BE WITH HIS MOM.

28
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:17,087
HE'S NOT READY TO MOVE ON.

29
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:19,923
YOU WOULD THINK HIS PARENTS

30
00:01:19,923 --> 00:01:21,892
WOULD WELCOME HIM THERE.

31
00:01:21,892 --> 00:01:25,796
HIS MOM WOULD WANT TO

32
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:25,829
HIS MOM WOULD WANT HO

33
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:26,530
HIS MOM WOULD WANT HIM TO LIVE

34
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:26,830
THERE.

35
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,635
>> IF AT THE AGE OF 30 YOU ARE

36
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:34,337
NOT READY TO LEAVE YOUR MOM'S

37
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:37,007
BASEMENT, WHY ARE YOU ABLE TO

38
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:39,876
DRINK OR DRIVE A CAR OR SERVE IN

39
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:40,944
THE MILITARY?

40
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:43,914
>> WE DON'T KNOW HE DOES THOSE

41
00:01:43,914 --> 00:01:44,281
THINGS.

42
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,918
HE SAID HE HAS A BEDROOM.

43
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:50,187
HE DIDN'T SAY HE LIVED IN THE

44
00:01:50,187 --> 00:01:51,088
BASEMENT.

45
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:57,761
WHAT'S WRONG WITH LIVING WITH

46
00:01:57,761 --> 00:01:59,196
YOUR PARENTS?

47
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:00,897
IN THE FUTURE, MAYBE HE WILL

48
00:02:00,897 --> 00:02:05,068
HAVE A NICE HOUSE AND MANSION

49
00:02:05,068 --> 00:02:06,970
THAT THEY WOULDN'T SPEND ON

50
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,238
LAWYERS, BUT THEY'LL SPEND ON

51
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:09,406
HIM.

52
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:12,042
>> I'M TRYING TO DISCERN A THEME

53
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:20,551
TO APPLY TO GET THINGS FOR FREE,

54
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,455
IF I REALLY LOVE A ROLEX, DO I

55
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:24,888
GET IT?

56
00:02:24,888 --> 00:02:29,093
>> IT'S A PARENT AND CHILD.

57
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:31,762
SHE'S ALWAYS A MOM.

58
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,430
HE'S ALWAYS A SON.

59
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,165
THEY SHOULDN'T HIRE A LAWYER AND

60
00:02:35,165 --> 00:02:36,834
GO AGAINST EACH OTHER IN COURT.

61
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:39,603
>> WHAT IF I LOVE THE WATCH, AND

62
00:02:39,603 --> 00:02:42,272
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS.

63
00:02:42,272 --> 00:02:43,640
I LOVE THAT WATCH.

64
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,742
IT'S A SINCERE LOVE.

65
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,512
WHY WOULD THEY CALL THE COPS ON

66
00:02:48,512 --> 00:02:50,314
ME IF I JUST TAKE IT?

67
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:52,583
>> SHE GAVE BIRTH TO THE CHILD.

68
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,551
YOU DIDN'T GIVE BIRTH TO THE

69
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:57,254
WATCH.

70
00:02:57,254 --> 00:03:00,557
THE MOTHER SHOULD UNDERSTAND,

71
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:03,160
IT'S HER RESPONSIBILITY.

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,929
IT'S HER CHILD NO MATTER HOW OLD

73
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:06,830
THE CHILD IS.

74
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,867
>> SO YOU CAN'T AGE OUT OF THIS

75
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,501
ARRANGEMENT.

76
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:12,269
ONCE YOU ARE BORN, YOU HAVE A

77
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:14,905
MORAL AND LEGAL RIGHT TO SPONGE

78
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:16,707
OFF YOUR PARENTS FOREVER?

79
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:18,709
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S SPONGING

80
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:19,209
OFF.

81
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,278
HE LOVES HIS MOTHER.

82
00:03:21,278 --> 00:03:22,713
MICHAEL LOVES HIS MOMMY.

83
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:25,816
HE WANTS TO BE WITH HER UNTIL

84
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:26,216
HE'S READY.

85
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:31,788
>> ARE YOU CONFUSED ABOUT THE

86
00:03:31,788 --> 00:03:33,390
EXPLOSION OF MAN CHILDREN IN OUR

87
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,158
SOCIETY.

88
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,562
>> WOMEN AND MEN 18 TO 25 ARE

89
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:39,997
LIVING AT HOME WITH THEIR

90
00:03:39,997 --> 00:03:40,697
PARENTS.

91
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:43,167
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

92
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:44,434
NOW.

93
00:03:44,434 --> 00:03:46,970
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, RIGHT?

94
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,306
WE ARE MAKING IT GREAT.

95
00:03:49,306 --> 00:00:00,000
>> IT'S A SAD NEW WORLD.
