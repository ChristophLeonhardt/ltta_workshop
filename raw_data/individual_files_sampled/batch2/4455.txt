welcome back why won't president Trump echo his country's own intelligence agencies and consistently and clearly say that Russia interfered in the last election and is still interfering and while the president avoids criticizing Vladimir Putin he did have harsh words for former CIA director John Brennan who called his Putin press conference performance quote treasonous well I think Brennan is a very bad guy and if you look at it a lot of things happened under his watch I think he's a very bad person former CIA director John Brennan joins me now doctor thank you so much for being here we do appreciate it I want to respond to the president well you know when the president when Donald Trump was elected president in November 2016 I was skeptical that he had the qualifications the temperament or even the potential to be a strong president I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt but soon after his election he started to denigrate the intelligence and law enforcement profession as well as professionals as well as their work and then over the past year and a half I think he has demonstrated time and time again that he lies the American people and that he is not fulfilling the responsibilities of the office of the presidency in terms of keeping this country strong and safe I was hoping he was going to bring this country together after a very contentious election and so I have been outspoken and I have taken to the Twittersphere and so my tweets I will acknowledge or rather shrill if not strident maybe I'm not just an intelligence officer and I'm trying to ring the bell because I see all the warning signs here especially when it comes to national security I worked in national security in the government for close to 35 years and on issues related to Iran and North Korea and proliferation and Russia and when I see the types of things that mr. Trump is doing yes I will speak out I'm hoping to be able to shake some but frankly some sense since the people around mr. Trump and those on the on the hill because the more that they tolerate and they make excuses for his behavior and his performance the more they're enabling him the more they're encouraging him to do these types of things I don't know whether or not he can change his ways or not I don't know if my tweets making any difference whatsoever but I feel it's my personal obligation stay true to my principles and the fact that you know mr. Truong calls me a bad person well I need to be able to speak openly and clearly about the concerns that I see in terms of the future security and safety of this country you say you can see the threats coming is the President of the United States himself a threat well I think the way he has behaved in the way he has acted again this two-hour one-on-one with mr. Putin okay but you know more than I know you know more than any of us know we know what we've seen in public you know what happened during the 2016 an election I know what the Russians did absolutely I had good insight into it and I know how capable and sophisticated and cunning the Russians are as well as how how clever mr. Putin is as a trained KGB officer and two hours with Donald Trump I have real questions about that and why did he not trust john bolton I'm Mike Pompeo and John Kelly to be in that meeting when he was there with his translator did was that translator excused did he pass written notes to mr. Putin and to the Russian translator so that our translator would not see it I don't know but there's something that is very very puzzling about this and I am I am concerned because I know how manipulative the Russians are and mr. Putin is and as the special counsels investigation continues to go forward we are going to find out the facts as Bob Muller uncovers them about whether or not there were individuals that were very close to mr. Trump and in the campaign who were actively abetting and aiding the Russian efforts to interfere in that election why did July 27th 2016 that press conference where I asked Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails why did that raise so many red flags because it was basically overt collusion encouraging the Russians to try to find her emails and and so we see you know collusion in plain sight now the question is whether things that are going on behind the scenes that may have in fact to help mr. Trump get elected he was elected I know he whenever he sees this issue he's concerned that this is undermining the legitimacy of his election and so he keeps going back to there was no clusion no collusion well we need to get to the bottom of that what the Russians did and who they did it with and I have great confidence in Bob Muller and going forward do you think that he's concerned about undermining the legitimacy of his own election because he knows that what happened helped him he knows that the wiki leaks leaks helped him that he might know more than that I think it's quite clear that the Russian active measures and what they were doing was influential and changed at least one vote did it change one vote or million votes it you never can know the answer to that question so whether or not it was the Russian assistance that might have gotten mr. Trump over the the finish line is unknown and we shouldn't go go there what we should do is try to get understand exactly who was doing what during that election and hold them to account hold the Russians to account and hold any American persons US persons to account for actively working with the Russians what happened in within the CIA when Donald Trump said that at that July 27th press conference well I think a lot of us were very very concerned about what he was doing encouraging the Russians and now as we know coming out of the indictments that rod Rosenstein had announced the other day that that very day that very night the Russians were going and looking for you know emails and other things so having a candidate for the presidency of the United States openly encouraged the Russians to do this I think was just an abomination and something that he is I find unconscionable there was a joint press statement that came out on October 7th you were part of that that said that Russia was trying to meddle in the election did you know then or were you suspicious then that Donald Trump or somebody on his team may have been working to time the release of those emails we were concerned that the Russians were going to take advantage of whatever types of contacts or intermediaries they had in order to further their aims and so again I will defer to Bob Muller and the FBI and those that have to investigate any type of us person collusion or cooperation again witting or unwitting but during that September October and early November timeframe we were trying to understand just the scope and scale of what the Russians were doing we're trying to understand exactly what they might in fact throw into this election you know discussion but also be able to make sure that we were able to not just understand it but also keep President Obama informed as well as the congressional leadership informed were you suspicious or concerned that there may have been collusion or coordination going on between the Trump campaign or Donald Trump and the Russians after that July 27th press conference I was very concerned that the Russians were going to continue what they've done for many many years which was to use their presence in the United States and their contacts with American persons to be able to advance their objectives not a no that is not a no that is not a no I am concerned about again whether or not someone was an unwitting part of this master plan on the part of the Russians or whether the PERT the people were actively working with the Russians I don't know I'm not going to speculate on that I just know that the Russians take full advantage of the freedoms and liberties of this great country in order to apply their intelligence trade what do you think those in the CIA and in the intelligence community are thinking now a year and a half into Donald Trump's presidency and after we've seen him openly deny the assessment that they've made over and over and over again after they saw him stand next to Vladimir Putin and praised Lattimore Putin while attacking his own DOJ and his own FBI and and passing off conspiracy theories about the DNC server I think many of them are you know shocked and appalled and continue to scratch their heads over why the a person who is the president of States is doing this but at the same time I have confidence that the women and men of CIA and FBI and NSA are going to do their absolute best irrespective of the person the Oval Office they try to keep this country strong one last question what do you think of the of the server could be Sanders today coming out and saying that the president is having conversations about allowing Russians to question ambassador michael mcfaul and bill Browder i think it's the height of absurdity to say that we're going to allow sort of Russian officials to question former American US officials on this matter majest√© continued efforts in the part of the Russians mr. Putin and others to try to have distractions and unfortunately I think mr.
