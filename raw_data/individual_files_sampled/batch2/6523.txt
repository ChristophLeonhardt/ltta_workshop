Ron de santis is running to be the governor of Florida and recently he made headlines after he attacked his Democratic opponent Andrew Gilliam by saying that the voters in the state of Florida shouldn't monkey this thing up Andrew Beulah Miz black by electing someone like Gilliam now there's new news about De Santis apparently he has spoken four times at a conference organized by conservative activist David Horowitz so why would that be problematic shank David Hart was a terrible guy okay so he they've got theories on white race Wars and a lot of the speakers at the conference were also terrible people like my Laurie innopolis and then these I mean they were in the White House so I don't know what to do with them but Steve Bannon Sebastian Gorka and then there's Dutch far-right leader guilt builders and he was also at these these guys say outrageous and terrible things on a regular basis so I Anna I'm actually I don't know don't know what to do with this story cuz so half of them are I mean my law worked with neo-nazis yep while at Breitbart to put together the all right Bible innocence right on the other hand the president says that there are good people on the Nazi side well I think it's important to fight back against normalizing the kind of rhetoric that you see from these terrible people and so I like the fact that this story made news I like the fact that him participating on four different occasions or at these types of events is something that could hurt him in this election and for me more than anything this further reinforced what we already believed after the the previous controversy ensued the one about him saying that voters should monkey this up or he shouldn't monkey this up referring to Andrew Gilliam you know there was some question about whether or not he misspoke or whether or not he actually meant to use a racist trope in in referring to Andrew Gilliam and now I believe we have more evidence that reinforces what we already believe we have our answer this is very similar the guy running in Virginia for the Republicans and the side and as so constantly had wrapped himself in a confederate flag the Confederate monuments etcetera and then we found out that he's working with people who are white supremacists and had spoken at their events multiple times in fact he had spoken with a guy who led the Charlottesville rally so it was guys it was always a spectrum so this is the same party that did the Southern Strategy the the whole point of the Southern Strategy which the Republican Party has now apologized for twice over there probably now under Trump taking it back but was go appeal to racists in the South by using coded rate racist language against blacks and other minorities so for the other Republicans to act shocked and chagrined now is wildly disingenuous and and so it's not at all surprising that the Santis went and spoke to people at this terrible conferences over and over again where they're having conversations about whether there's gonna be a race war but first of all let's acknowledge that in America there already was a race war and so luckily and then there was a real war to undo the race war that was called the Civil War okay so but minorities never started any of these but in their crazy minds they're like oh my god the minorities are gonna do this why as always projection that's one thing when they're at these goofy things I David they call David Horowitz Freedom Center restoration weekend they restore my freedom to oppress other people right it's another thing when they become the president running for governor running for Senator and DeSantis he didn't say monkey it up by accident the day after Gilliam one that's there's I have no doubt in my mind the guy who goes to these events is the guy who says monkey it up they try to rally racist to his side two easy ways for young turks want us hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube you're notified of our videos
