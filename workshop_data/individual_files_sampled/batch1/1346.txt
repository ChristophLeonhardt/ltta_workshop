understandable really all them on it clean it wash basket into there instead akasha bone on the lonely dad checked on the agenda ha the media narrative has really played an important role for the AKP government and for president I want to disseminate a particular version of the event which was gonna need a nurse to get Gossage in Italian hoagies Yaka $10 billion ji million from the soldiers and civilians killed and injured to the bullets card wars of government buildings from accusations confessions prosecution's and recriminations a new national narrative has emerged in which Turkey is beset by an enemy within the fettle a terror organization to be known henceforth by the acronym feta David's almost there journalists who want to defend the state also want to keep the 15th of July high on the agenda if you consider the character the texture the intricate structure and the sophistication of the organization that we've fought against on the 15th of July you will better understand why that day will not be forgotten behind it Burnaby ambition was propaganda see the government is trying to keep itself in power of the back of the propaganda of 15th of July even before the Qura tent came to an end the pro-government media were very quick to label the coup plotters as members of feta this discourse has continued unabated since that date judaculla active army in truth the Gulen movement and the arc party coexisted and cooperated for years before relations soured Gulen ist's took top jobs in the judiciary in education in the police and army and had significant holdings in the media but that history has no place in the current government discourse which has g√ºlen's followers infiltrating turkey's institutions to form a parallel state when that organization attempted to seize power by force it was only president earlier ones timely and effective mobilisation of the popular will that stopped them however while their coup attempt was thwarted their supporters are still being outed all the time not only in the courts but in trials by media so when a new decree law is announced and people raise their concerns about the implications of that decree law usually the first response from a programmer in conduct is are you a member of the feta wool American and ecologically fit in England all the negatives this becomes a vehicle in for silencing oppositional voices and for discouraging people from asking questions not only about the feta but in general about any government policy fit the issue of feta and Turkey is not an easy thing to grasp it is a movement which was so well hidden that many journalists supported them unfortunately some are saying that there have been unjust investigations and prosecutions against feta such as cases against journalists but we need to distinguish between journalists and those who really call themselves journalists according to president Erdogan and many in the Turkish media the influence of feta even extends to a court in New York where late last year Reza's Arab a turkish-iranian gold trader admitted to running a sanctions busting racket trading Iranian oil for gold paying millions of dollars in bribes to senior Turkish ministers along the way zarab testimony implicated Derwin in his son bilal but viewed from Turkey this is all part of a feta inspired international conspiracy the Halcomb a federal judge has a linked fettle the prosecutor has a clear link to that old one of the witnesses is a fettle member who fled Turkey this is all linked to in Turkey stop playing the international role expected of it and started to pursue its own destiny this hostility will continue first the government's and pro-government media and find massive importance to the RAB as a valuable turkish however when syrup started to cooperate with the prosecutor's office the prosecutor the judge and the entire US Justice Department were declared Joe Luna Judi conscious and I bow down not to of course this isn't a credible narrative there is a discrepancy between the reporting of the zurab case by the Turkish and the international media the international media look forward to seeing information against our wise against his ministers and against Turkey his fight with the military has been a long time coming to man who has tightened his grip on power by jailing thousands of political opponents at home 50,000 people have been arrested a hundred and fifty thousand people either lost their jobs or been suspended following the 15th of July the silence of Western actors seemed to say that they were sad that the who had been prevented this may journalists who thought turkey in the West share common interests reconsider their positions Edwin was in France when a French journalist asked him a question about Syria and president Aaron was not happy with this question and he asked the journalist if he was a member of feta all of these international and domestic developments can be explained as part of this international conspiracy against Turkey persecuted by enemies abroad infiltrated by enemies within most of the Turkish media have now closed ranks around a state sanctioned narrative that appears to explain all of this in terms of the failed 2016 coup attempt meanwhile hundreds of journalists have been arrested their news outlets shuttered or taken over by government supporters the result is a media landscape where the only story is the July 15 story the program of media is serving the same political narrative and the same political objectives as Ardoin and in KP government obviously you know their political agendas are very much aligned and because they serve to propagate the message from the party and from the president we can see several similarities in terms of their narratives eighty to ninety percent of the media in Turkey has been under government control for a long time and they reports with one voice that is communicating Edwin's views solely within the last year we are seeing what we call the presidential palace media fighting among themselves to prove who is more Pro adilyn who is super ultra super ultra pro adorns a blonde rule that I came there a little make-up wish my wife said let the stories that a nation tells become how that nation imagines itself collect how it understands its victimhood its identity and its destiny if the turkey July 15 was the day everything changed narratives around the failed coup and fettle are a new national creation with one that with so much of the Turkish media behind it is rapidly becoming a new national reality
