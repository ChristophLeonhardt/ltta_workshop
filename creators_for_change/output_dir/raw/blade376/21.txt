00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone i am testing live streaming</font>

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,809
on youtube to see if this works so let's

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:24,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a look here videos and hey I'm just</font>

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,429
seeing if the live streaming was working

5
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,410
clearly people<font color="#E5E5E5"> been getting links it's</font>

6
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:34,559
just it's not appearing on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

7
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:44,010
page let's have a look here well maybe

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:51,629
it doesn't appear there until hey

9
00:00:51,629 --> 00:01:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone hey great so I normally use</font>

10
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,040
twitch because when they first allowed

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
gaming live streaming it had to be done

12
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,020
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube gaming it was like a</font>

13
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,420
separate thing and so I never linked my

14
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,549
accounts and i've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using switch but</font>

15
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,600
not a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people use twitch or they</font>

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,009
use it but they're not they don't have

17
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,619
account so they can't chat and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

18
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,659
few people watch my twitch live streams

19
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,460
because there's not much interaction

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,549
which is quite frustrating so I wanted

21
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,020
to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on here today so i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,220
looking on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the page and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i may actually</font>

23
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,229
get to a point where i start doing I

24
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,119
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do weekly gaming streams</font>

25
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,799
because it's saying I don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

26
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,290
about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my videos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I am a huge</font>

27
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,369
gamer and it's finding the best way to

28
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,659
do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was actually going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a video</font>

29
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,460
a long time ago because I've got a lot

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,049
of highlight clips of different games<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

31
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,860
play but yeah I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just try the</font>

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,469
last of us and it's it's coming up on

33
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,500
here so that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just wondering</font>

34
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,729
how it will appear for other people so

35
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm just having a look here

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,038
subscriptions it's lazy they just

37
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,890
chained in hello I'm playing the

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,230

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,850
playing it on Survivor mode which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

42
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">original hardest mode they then did an</font>

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,360
upgrade where you could do ground it

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,490
which is even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult but I'm on</font>

45
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the second playthrough on Survivor mode</font>

46
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,120
which means I get to keep a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,330
upgrades and stuff to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a</font>

49
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:45,150
it's not many spoilers but there was an

50
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,800
infection which plagues the world and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font>

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,330
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future you're playing this</font>

52
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,980
character called Joel who was quite

53
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,450
bitter he lost his daughter<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

54
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,989
affection and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of his family and</font>

55
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,310
they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick up a shipment</font>

56
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,790
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this group called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fireflies</font>

58
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:07,019

59
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,300
didn't have their shipment the fireflies

60
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,750
took it met the fireflies<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Firefly</font>

61
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,970
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll give you the weapons the</font>

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,340
shipment but only<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you smuggle this</font>

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,030
merchandise out of the city so they've

64
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,680
cleared it they found out they do have

65
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,410
the merchandise but the shipment the

66
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,030

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,260
it's a really creepy gaming places as

72
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,420
well but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm on Survivor mode</font>

73
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,290
there's not many resources and I could

74

bit is proper cray here we go now anyone

423
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,770
who plays this game if you want a good

424
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:33,920
technique because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to go</font>

425
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,380
the right speed that the so you're slow

426
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,280
enough that the clickers don't hear you

427
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,050
so the strategy i use which works really

428
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:47,320
well is

429
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:58,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think you yeah you get brick and your</font>

430
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:07,810
aim it and if you aim it like this you

431
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:11,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get around</font>

432
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:19,010
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these ones can see don't forget so</font>

433
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:29,030
you got to go really slow it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

434
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:34,210
unpredictable though it's freaky move oh

435
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:40,910
this is so tense I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like how the AI</font>

436
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:53,569
just runs around so hopefully there'll

437
00:40:53,569 --> 00:40:59,150
be some be as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're aiming you</font>

438
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:05,170
won't be going too fast

439
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:13,090
nothing useful all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right let's let's get</font>

440
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:15,570

00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:38,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">testing a live streaming on youtube</font>

443
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,270
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I normally do it on switch but</font>

444
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube would be better but when I first</font>

445
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:50,410
vote run but when they first allowed you

446
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,690
to do it it was only if you had a gaming

447
00:41:52,690 --> 00:42:04,810
account this is so tense these click is

448
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,570
a horrible horrible horrible oh and the

449
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">lights going out got to show you</font>

450
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:18,400
controller when that happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right</font>

there I'll let us click a go past I

453
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,730
assume I'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump over without</font>

454
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,540
alerting him

455
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,750

461
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:23,079
I think

462
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:52,209
I just always had the ability they have

463
00:43:52,209 --> 00:43:55,979
which is to run around like a muppet

464
00:44:07,589 --> 00:44:12,059
they in<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn around don't turn around</font>

472
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:31,460
