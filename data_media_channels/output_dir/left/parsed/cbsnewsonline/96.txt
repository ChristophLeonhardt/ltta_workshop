MOLLIE TIBBETTS IS A SENSITIVE, 
RESPECTFUL YOUNG LADY. 
SHE IS AN OUTSTANDING STUDENT 
Ãº 
PROFESSORS AND CLASSMATES. 
HER DISAPPEARANCE IS COMPLETELY 
OUT OF CHARACTER FOR HER. 
WE HAVE DETECTIVES AND AGENTS 
DEVOTED SOLELY TO THIS CASE WHO 
CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE ALL 
TIPS AND LIENS. 
WE ARE TAKING THIS CASE VERY 
SERIOUSLY AND EVERY AVENUE OF 
THE INVESTIGATION IS BEING 
PURSUED. 
INVESTIGATORS ARE CONDUCTING 
SEARCHES, CANVASSING THE LOCAL 
AREA, AND FOLLOWING UP ON ALL 
REPORTED INFORMATION. 
WHILE WE ARE RELUCTANT TO 
DISCUSS ALL OF THE 
INVESTIGATIVE LEADS, AND THE 
DETAILS OF THIS CASE, AS WELL 
AS THE METHODS, WE WILL UTILIZE 
EVERY TECHNOLOGY AND ALL 
AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
THE RESPONSE FROM OUR COMMUNITY 
HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY 
POSITIVE AS WE CONTINUE OUR 
ATTEMPTS TO LOCATE HER. 
UNDERSTANDABLY, THIS IS A 
STRESSFUL TIME FOR THE 
COMMUNITY AND FOR THOSE WHO 
LOVE HER. 
WE ASK THAT YOU REMAIN PATIENT 
AND VIGILANT. 
ONCE AGAIN, WE WOULD LIKE TO 
THANK ALL WHO HAVE BRAVELY COME 
FORWARD TO PROVIDE INFORMATION 
TO DATE, AS WE CONTINUE IN OUR 
EFFORTS. 
WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR 
ASSISTANCE IN IDENTIFYING 
POSSIBLE BYSTANDERS OR 
WITNESSES. 
AS WE HAVE SAID BEFORE, WE ARE 
CONSIDERING ALL POTENTIAL 
SCENARIOS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT 
MOLLIE TIBBETTS CAME INTO 
CONTACT WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS 
CAUSED HER HARM. 
THIS PERSON IT MAY NOT 
NECESSARILY BE A MEMBER OF OUR 
COMMUNITY BUT LIKELY HAS SOME 
FAMILIARITY WITH THE AREA. 
WHILE RESIDENTS MAY HAVE 
DEVELOPED THEIR OWN OPINIONS AS 
TO WHAT HAPPENED TO MOLLIE 
TIBBETTS, WE ARE ASKING 
EVERYONE TO REFLECT BACK ON THE 
DAYS PRIOR TO HER DISAPPEARANCE 
IN THE HOPES OF RECALLING 
DETAILS ABOUT ANY PERSONS OR 
VEHICLES IN THE AREA. 
INDIVIDUALS WHO COMMIT VIOLENT 
CRIMES OFTEN DISPLAY BEHAVIOR 
THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY THOSE 
WITH WHOM THEY LIVE, WORK, 
ATTEND SCHOOL, OR ARE IN 
OTHERWISE CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS 
WITH. 
OFTEN THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO 
ARE UNKNOWINGLY ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE OFFENDER OF A CRIME AND MAY 
BE IN A POSITION TO OBSERVE THE 
BEHAVIORAL CHANGES IN THAT 
PERSON. 
THEY WILL RECOGNIZE THE CHANGE 
AND MAY EVEN QUESTION THEM 
ABOUT IT, BUT THEY WILL NOT 
RELATE THE CHANGE TO THAT 
PERSON'S INVOLVEMENT IN A 
CRIME. 
PLEASE CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE 
NOTICED ONE OR MORE OF THE 
FOLLOWING CHANGES IN A PERSON

INVESTIGATION. 
IT IS OFTEN IN CASES LIKE THIS 
THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE 
INFORMATION THEY DO NOT 
INITIALLY SHARE FOR A NUMBER OF 
COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE 
REASONS. 
FOR EXAMPLE, THEY DO NOT 
INITIALLY FEEL IT WAS IMPORTANT 
OR ASSUMED SOMEONE ELSE MAY 
HAVE ALREADY NOTIFIED LAW 
ENFORCEMENT. 
WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO PROVIDE 
WHATEVER INFORMATION YOU MAY 
HAVE. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE YOUR 
OWN JUDGMENT ABOUT IMPORTANCE. 
PLEASE LET US ASSESS THE 
RELEVANCE OF YOUR TIP OR 
INFORMATION. 
FURTHERMORE, IF YOU ARE WORRIED 
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN 
WHICH YOU OBTAIN THIS 
INFORMATION, YOUR IDENTITY CAN 
REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

WEBSITE TO ALLOW THE COMMUNITY 
TO FURTHER ASSIST IN THIS 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE INVITE YOU TO VISIT THE 
WEBSITE, 
WWW.FINDINGMOLLY.IOWA.GOV.

FINALLY, WE WANT TO THANK ALL 
OF YOU, OUR COMMUNITY, THE 
MEDIA, THE NATION. 
FOR STANDING WITH US AS WE WORK 
TO BRING MOLLY HOME. 
AT THIS TIME, SPECIAL AGENT AND 
I WILL ADDRESS A FEW QUESTIONS. 
>> HAVE YOU IDENTIFIED IN YOUR 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> WE ARE USING EVERY TECHNIQUE 
THAT IS AVAILABLE TO TRACK DOWN 
AND LOCATE MOLLY. 
I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO TRACK THE DIGITAL 
FOOTPRINT. 
WHATEVER MEDIA DEVICES, WE ARE 
ACCESSING THOSE AS BEST WE CAN. 
MAKE ANY TRIP SO FAR? 
NO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
RELEASE THAT INFORMATION AND 
UNDERSTAND THAT I WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO GIVE YOU INVESTIGATIVE 
FACTS. 
WE WILL TRY TO KEEP THOSE CLOSE 
TO THE VEST FOR THE INTEGRITY 
OF THE INVESTIGATION. 
WE WILL CERTAINLY TRY TO ANSWER 
AS MUCH AS I CAN FOR YOU. 
>> WILLING TO REVIEW HER 
INFORMATION? 
>> WHAT WAS THE FIRST PART? 
SELECT BEEN WILLING TO GIVE YOU 
ACCESS? 
>> THOSE THAT WE HAVE DONE 
SEARCH WARRANTS, THAT IS PART 
OF THE INVESTIGATION THAT IS 
COMMON WITH ANY INVESTIGATION 
THAT WE DO. 
WE WILL GET TOGETHER SEARCH 
WARRANTS AND SUBPOENAS AND THEY 
HAVE BEEN HONORING THOSE. 
YES. 
CONNECT THE TASK FORCE. 
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DIFFERENTLY 
THAT YOU WERE NOT DOING IN THE 
THREE WEEKS? 
NO THE TASK FORCE ACTUALLY WAS 
STARTED AND GENERATED AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE ONSET OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE CONTINUE TO USE AS MANY 
RESOURCES AS AVAILABLE. 
I WILL TELL YOU THAT WE HAVE 
HAD RESOURCES FROM ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY REACHING OUT AND BEING 
WILLING TO HELP OUT. 
WE WILL TAP INTO ANYBODY OR ANY 
ORGANIZATION THAT WE CAN TO 
TRACK HER DOWN. 
>> SEVERAL LOCATIONS ARE 
HIGHLIGHTED ON THE MAP. 
WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE 
LOCATIONS? 
MIKE WELL, THOSE ARE LOCATIONS 
THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED ON THE 
MAPS TO HELP TO REMIND PEOPLE 
IF THEY WERE TO TAP INTO THOSE 
SITS AND TO BE ABLE TO 
HOPEFULLY GENERATE SOME IDEA OR 
SOME THOUGHTS. 
NO SPECIFIC REASON FOR THOSE 
CERTAIN AREAS, BUT WE ARE 
HOPING THAT PEOPLE LOOK AT THE 
MAP TO BE ABLE TO JOG THEIR 
MEMORY, BASICALLY. 
>> A LOT OF RESOURCES PULLED 
INTO -- TO EXECUTE A SEARCH 
WARRANT? 
DID YOU WILLINGLY? 
NO I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 
DIVULGE WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON 
THE INVESTIGATION AND WHO WE 
HAVE SPOKEN WITH AND WHERE WE 
HAVE GONE TO CONDUCT SEARCHES 
BUT WE HAVE DONE A NUMBER OF 
SEARCHES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY 
AND ABROAD. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 
SEARCHES INCLUDED ACREAGE, 
FARMS, HOMES, SILOS, BARN 
ANYWHERE THAT ELITE WOULD TAKE 
US IS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO GO 
AND SEARCH. 
BACK AT THIS POINT, -- STOMACH 
AT THIS POINT WE ARE 
IDENTIFYING IT AS A MISSING 
PERSON. 
WE ARE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO 
FIND HER SOON AND BRING HER 
HOME SOON. 
YOU HAVE BEEN TYPED -- 
TIGHTLIPPED. 
ARE YOU ON THE VERGE OF AN 
ARREST? 
HAVE YOU GOT NOTHING? 
TO MAKE OUR MESSAGE IS TO 
CONTINUE TO CALL ITALY AS WE 
WILL CONTINUE TO RUN UP THOSE 
LEADS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN I AM 
NOT GOING TO LET EVERYONE KNOW 
WHAT WE HAVE AND WHAT WE DO NOT 
HAVE. 
WE WOULD WELCOME AS MANY 
TELEPHONE CALLS AND INFORMATION 
AS THEY FEEL RELEVANT. 
SELECT AS FAR AS SETTING UP THE 
WEBSITE, WHY DO YOU BELIEVE 
THAT THIS WILL BE A GAME 
CHANGER? 
IS THIS SOMETHING NEW? 
NO IT IS ANOTHER AVENUE FOR 
PEOPLE TO USE AND ANOTHER 
CONDUIT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION 
TO US IN THE INVESTIGATIVE 
TEAM. 
SOME PEOPLE ARE MORE TECHIE 
THAN OTHERS. 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD PREFER TO 
PLACE A TELEPHONE CALL AND 
WRITE LETTERS. 
WE HAVE RECEIVED LETTERS AND 
POSTCARDS. 
THIS IS ONE MORE AVENUE FOR 
PEOPLE TO TAKE IN THIS DIGITAL 
WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN. 
>> SPEAKING OF THE FEATURES, 
GOING THROUGH QUICKLY, WHAT CAN 
CINDY FIND? 
>> WE HAVE THIS MAP THAT IS 
INTERACTIVE THAT THEY CAN PULL 
UP AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP. 
THERE IS ALSO A LINK FOR THE 
TIPS THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE AN 
ANONYMOUS TIP IF THEY SO CHOOSE 
AND EVEN SOME TELEPHONE 
NUMBERS. 
IT IS ANOTHER CONDUIT FOR THE 
GENERAL PUBLIC TO BE ABLE TO 
USE TO PROVIDE US INFORMATION 
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BE ABLE 
TO BET THAT INFORMATION AND, 
AGAIN, I WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT 
NO MATTER HOW MINUTE OR MINUTE 
THEY THINK THAT THE INFORMATION 
MAY BE, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT 
THEY PROVIDE IT TO US. 
>> SPECULATION -- CHANGING 
BECAUSE OF THE BACKGROUND. 
STALKING AND VIOLATING 
RESTRAINING ORDERS. 
HAVE YOU MET OTHER PEOPLE WITH 
QUESTIONABLE BACKGROUNDS AND 
TALKED WITH OTHER SEX OFFENDERS 
IN THE AREA? 
NO I'M NOT GOING TO MENTION WHO 
WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH. 
I AM NOT GOING TO RELEASE ANY 
NAMES OR ANY OF THE INFORMATION 
ON THE INVESTIGATION ITSELF I 
WILL NOT DO THAT. 
>> SOMEONE THAT SHE KNOWS? 
SOME MISUNDERSTANDING? 
>> WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL 
OPTIONS, ALL POSSIBILITIES. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT 
UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO BRING HER 
BACK. 
>> WE FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THE 
TIME I PUT AGAIN, I WILL NOT BE 
ABLE TO READ -- TO RELEASE THE 
TIMELINE BUT LIKE ANY OTHER 
INVESTIGATION, WE WILL COME UP 
WITH THE TIMELINE AND WE WILL 
USE THAT YOU COME TO A 
CONCLUSION OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
WE HAVE A TIMELINE IN PLACE WE 
DO NOT FEEL LIKE THE PUBLIC IS 
AT RISK PER SE. 
CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING 
THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED 
ABOUT. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT AS AN 
INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY AND TEAM 
FELT THAT THE PUBLIC WAS AT 
RISK, WE WOULD NOTIFY THEM OF 
THAT AND PROVIDE THAT 
INFORMATION. 
SO FAR WE HAVE NOT FOUND THE 
NEED TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT. 
>> ARE LEADS COMING IN? 
>> THEY ARE. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE 
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM HAS RECEIVED 
IN EXCESS OF 1500 TIPS AND THAT 
CONTINUES TO CLIMB. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT AND -- AS 
AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM, WE HAVE 
CONDUCTED 500 INTERVIEWS BUT I 
CAN TELL YOU THAT THE CRIME 
STOPPERS HAS GOT THE AWARD OF 
TWO -- I THINK IT IS $356,414. 
THAT COMES FROM 228 DONORS. 
CERTAINLY THIS HAS GENERATED A 
LOT OF PUBLIC INTEREST. 
PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED, AS ARE 
WE. 
WE WOULD WELCOME THE TELEPHONE 
CALLS AND INFORMATION SO THAT 
WE CAN TRY TO FIND HER. 
LIKE WILL IT ALLOW YOU TO GET 
BETTER TIPS? 
TO GIVE PEOPLE A BETTER IDEA OF 
WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED? 
THOSE TIPS WOULD BE BETTER? 
>> WHAT WAS THE FIRST PART OF 
THE QUESTION? 
MIKE AFTER 3 1/2 WEEKS OF THE 
INVESTIGATION, NEW INFORMATION 
TO GIVE PEOPLE A BETTER SENSE 
OF WHAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED AND 
TO INCREASE THE QUALITY? 
NO I DO NOT THINK SO. 
THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE WANT 
TO KEEP THE INVESTIGATION AND 
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF IT. 
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE DO 
WITH THE DCI. 
WE DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION 
ON THE INVESTIGATION AS IT IS 
ONGOING. 
SO AGAIN, THAT IS WHY WE 
REEMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE THAT 
IF THEY THINK THEY KNOW THE 
INFORMATION, TO PROVIDE THAT TO 
US AND WE WILL LOOK AT THAT. 
>> DIVIDING RESOURCES? 
>> YES. 
>> HOW FRUSTRATED ARE YOU THAT 
HE HAS NOT LED TO ATTEMPTS OF 
FINDING OUT? 
>> WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IT 
WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO FINDING 
HER. 
WE HAVE NOT LOST HOPE. 
WE CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO BRING 
HER BACK HOME SAFELY. 
WE ARE NOT FRUSTRATED. 
WE JUST ARE DILIGENT. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. 
>> ARE YOU STILL LETTING 
EVERYBODY -- THEY ARE WAITING 
-- CAPPING THE REWARD? 
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO CAP 
ANYTHING BUT WE DO NOT THINK 
ALONG THOSE LINES. 
WE THINK THAT IF MONEY IS 
GENERATED TO HELP BRING HER 
HOME, WE WELCOME THAT. 
>> HISTORY IN THIS AREA OF 
OBJECTIONS IN THIS REGION? 
>> I DO NOT HAVE SPECIFICS FOR 
IT. 
I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE LOOKING 
INTO AND KEEPING AN OPEN MIND 
ON. 
I KNOW THAT TRAFFICKING IS 
SOMETHING THAT IS DISCUSSED ON 
A REGULAR BASIS BUT I DO NOT 
HAVE ANY STATISTICS FOR YOU BUT 
I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE 
THAT. 
THAT MAKES PEOPLE SAY, SHE CAN 
GO ANYWHERE SHE WANTS. 
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU ARE 
MISSING? 
>> WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE -- 
WE HAVE A TIMELINE THAT IS WHAT 
WE USE AS PART OF OUR 
INVESTIGATION. 
I DO NOT QUITE KNOW WHAT YOU 
ARE ASKING. 
WE FEEL CONFIDENT OF THE 
TIMELINE ITSELF. 
>> PART OF THE TIMELINE? 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK 
INTO. 
AS AN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM, WE 
WILL LOOK FROM THE EARLY 
MORNING HOURS OF THAT 
PARTICULAR DAY ON JULY 18 UP 
UNTIL THE EVENING HOURS. 
WE TRIED TO GET AS MUCH 
INFORMATION AND IS MUCH AS WE 
CAN WHEN IT COMES TO THESE 
TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS. 
>> HAVE YOU EVER DEALT WITH 
SOMETHING SIMILAR? 
>> SADLY, WE HAVE. 
WE HAVE HAD MISSING PEOPLE 
BEFORE. 
SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE DEAL 
WITH. 
SADLY, WE WILL HAVE TO PROBABLY 
DEAL WITH IT IN THE FUTURE. 
WE HOPE NOT BUT IT IS A 
POSSIBILITY. 
WE HAVE DONE THESE 
INVESTIGATIONS BEFORE. 
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS 
A JOINT INVITATION TO 
INVESTIGATION WITH THE FBI AND 
THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND A 
NUMBER OF AGENCIES FROM ACROSS 
THE COUNTRY THAT ARE WILLING TO 
ASSIST AND HELP WHICH WE 
GREATLY APPRECIATE. 
>> HOW MANY DIVIDING RESOURCES 
BETWEEN THE WEBSITE AND THERE 
TIP LIKE? 
ARE YOU ADDING MORE PERSONAL? 
IS PERSONNEL GOING TO BE 
REASSIGNED? 
>> WHATEVER PERSONALITIES WE 
ARE GOING TO USE. 
THAT IS WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE 
TO DO AS THE INVESTIGATION 
CONTINUES. 
>> WHEN WOULD THE NUMBER 
DECREASED AND HOW MUCH MONEY 
ARE WE SPENDING WORKING ON THE 
CASE? 
SELECT THE MONEY, I DON'T KNOW 
BUT I DO NOT TRACK THAT. 
MY JOB IS TO INVESTIGATE CRIME. 
THE MONEY IS NOT AN ISSUE BUT 
WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT THAT. 
OUR ISSUE IS TRYING TO TRACK 
DOWN MOLLY. 
>> HOW IS THE MORALE AMONG 
INVESTIGATORS? 
>> OUR MORREALE IS GOOD. 
WE FEEL CONFIDENT AND QUITE 
HONESTLY I APPRECIATE THE 
QUESTION, BUT IT IS REALLY NOT 
ABOUT US BUT IT IS ABOUT TRYING 
TO FIND MOLLY. 
WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO 
FIND HER. 
>> ANY OTHER QUESTIONS? 
>> HOW MANY AGENTS OR 
DETECTIVES? 
NO I DO NOT HAVE A NUMBER RIGHT 
NOW BUT I HAVE A NUMBER OF 
PEOPLE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW 
RUNNING UP LEADS AS WE SPEAK IT 
IS ONGOING IT CONTINUES TO 
REQUIRE A LOT OF MANPOWER AND 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEDICATE 
THAT MANPOWER FOR BRINGING HER 
HOME. 
>>> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? 
>> I DO NOT FORESEE LESSENING 
MANPOWER AT THIS POINT IN TIME. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
DRIVE FORWARD AND WHATEVER IT 
TAKES BUT CERTAINLY THERE ARE 
OTHER THINGS THAT POP UP AND 
REQUIRE ATTENTION THAT MEANS 
THAT WE BRING OTHER PEOPLE IN 
AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. 
OKAY? 
AGAIN, I WOULD EMPHASIZE, IF 
YOU COULD, TO THE PUBLIC, TO 
TAP INTO FINDING MOLLY. 
IF YOU CAN PUSH THAT OUT, THAT 
WOULD BE GREAT. 
WE APPRECIATE IT. 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> WE HAVE JUST BEEN LISTENING 
TO INVESTIGATORS IN MONTEZUMA, 
IOWA, GIVING US AN UPDATE ON 
THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE 20-
YEAR-OLD MOLLIE TIBBETTS. 
THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY NEW 
INFORMATION TO SHARE. 
ONE OF THE OFFICERS DID SAY 
THAT SOMEONE MAY HAVE COME INTO 
CONTACT WITH MOLLY IN THE DAYS 
BEFORE HER DISAPPEARANCE. 
THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE BEEN 
FROM THE COMMUNITY. 
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR 
WITH IT. 
THEY ARE ASKING FOR THE 
PUBLIC'S HELP IN SCOURING THEIR 
MEMORIES TO SEE IF THEY CAN 
REMEMBER ANY DETAILS OR 
INFORMATION ABOUT ANY 
INDIVIDUALS OR VEHICLES. 
THEY MAY HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE 
AREA IN THOSE DAYS PRECEDING
