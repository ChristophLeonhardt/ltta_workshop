making the pledge regret something he never did hashtag TFM getting in the best shape of your life for the unhealthiest week of your life hashtag TFM leaving the plug is instructions on how to haze himself during spring break hashtag TFM that one didn't perform very well on twitter but i like that one we just felt like that will really warrant any other mainstream outlets that captured this particular genre in the way that we wanted to do it when TFM came around in 2010 there wasn't really a website that capitalized on fraternity related humor and it's something that no matter how old you are if you've been in a fraternity and you know what goes on inside the houses you're gonna get it it's humor that has been there for a long time but hasn't really been tapped into and I think that TFM was the first website to finally capitalize and bring that to bring that to light I think to a lot of people there's a general aversion to TFM because they think that we're just douchey frat guys our willingness to both celebrate and skewer Greek life it's a weird line that it's almost hard to define it's like the Supreme Court on pornography just kind of know it when you see it I'm here to tell you about the men of Alpha Epsilon Pi I think returning guys are more self-aware and people give them credit for they just kind of embrace it we celebrate people who act that way up to a certain point and then they take it too far and all of a sudden becomes uncool because they think it's how they're supposed to look or act let me find those people because they try too hard to be cool or to be fret if you're in Greek life you like TFM because you relate to the voice and you recognize the jokes and if you're outside of Greek life it honestly might be even more appealing because it's a view into a world that you don't know much about we've made a pretty big effort to kind of broaden our content to a point where hopefully anybody can go to the site read it and laugh whether you're laughing with us or at us you know as long as you're laughing then we've done
