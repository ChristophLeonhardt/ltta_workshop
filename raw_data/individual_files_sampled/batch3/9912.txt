GOOD MORNING, STEVE. THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR. A PACKAGE WAS DELIVERED AT 5:00 A.M. TO TRIBECA FILM PRODUCTIONS. IT WAS ADDRESSED TO ROBERT DENIRO. FOUND IN THE MAIL ROOM OF TRIBECA FILM PRODUCTIONst BY SECURITY PERSONNEL. THEY NOTICED THIS PACKAGE LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE THAT HAS BEEN ON TV. THE SAME CHARACTERISTICS LIKE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT NOW FOR THE LAST DAY. SO WHAT ALL THESE PACKAGES LOOK LIKE. THE HEAVY MANILA ENVELOPE. THE BLOCKED LETTERING. THE POSTAGE STAMPS. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE NYPD THEN RESPONDED HERE TRIBECA FILM PRODUCTIONS. THEY X-RAYED THAT PACKAGE AND DETERMINED THAT THEY NEEDED TO MOVE IT IN THE CONTAINMENT VEHICLE. WE SAW THAT CON AT THE SAME TIME VEHICLE YESTERDAY AT TIME WARNER CNN. MOVING THAT PACKAGE OVER TO RODMAN'S NECK. THIS IS A FACILITY WHERE THEY MOVE ALL THESE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES HERE IN NEW YORK. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THAT FOR YEARS. THEY EXAMINED THE PARTICULAR EXPLOSIVE DEVICE AT THAT FACILITY. THAT IS WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR. CLEARLY, AGAIN, THIS WORKER, SECURITY PERSONNEL NOTICED THAT IT LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE THE ONES WE THAT WE HAVE BEEN SHOWING ON TV. ALSO, TO NOTE, OBVIOUSLY, THIS PACKAGE HAD BEEN SITTING IN THAT MAIL ROOM FOR AT LEAST A DAY. YOU KNOW, MAIL WAS NOT DELIVERED EARLY THIS MORNING AT 5:00 A.M.
