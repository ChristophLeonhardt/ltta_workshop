1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,540
THE CEO OF QATAR AIRWAYS IS
FACING SOME CRITICISM AFTER HE

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,040
PUBLICLY AND VERY TRANSPARENT
LEASE SPOKE OUT ABOUT THE

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,929
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS THAT HE LIKES
TO EMPLOYEE AND THE OLD GRANNIES

4
00:00:13,929 --> 00:00:18,020
THAT FLIGHT ATTENDANTS IN THE
UNITED STATES LIKE TO EMPLOY.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,400
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT
BEFORE WE GO TO THE VIDEO.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,949
THIS IS AKBAR AL BAKER AND
HE MADE HIS REMARKS EARLIER THIS

7
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:28,990
MONTH DURING A SPEAKING EVENT IN
IRELAND.

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,480
AT THAT EVENT HE WAS SUPPOSED TO
COMMEMORATE A NEW FLIGHT

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,749
ROUTE BETWEEN IRISH CAPITAL AND
DOHA.

10
00:00:34,749 --> 00:00:39,379
HE KINDLY KIND OF WENT ON A
LITTLE BIT OF ATTENTION

11
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:40,629
WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOW YOU DIRECTLY
TO COLLECT A

12
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:57,170
BUT IT IS A 26 YEARS AT THAT
THERE ARE NO REASONS TO

13
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:02,069
TRAVEL ON THESE AMERICAN
CARRIERS ANYMORE.

14
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:08,590
OUR FIRST-CLASS PASSENGERS -
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE ALWAYS BEING

15
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,670
SERVED BY GRANDMOTHERS ON THOSE
AMERICAN AIRLINES A

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,670
AUDIENCE EIGHTÃ– OKAY, SO
THIS IS WITH THE ZOO ALL THE

17
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,740
TIME BACK IN THE DAY.

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,009
WHEN THE AIRLINES FIRST CAME
ABOUT YOU WOULD ALWAYS HAVE

19
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:26,299
ATTRACTIVE, YOUNG WOMEN WHO WERE
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS SO THEN CAME

20
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:29,790
IN ANNOYING LAWS ABOUT HAVE TO
BE EQUAL AND TREAT EVERYONE

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,729
EQUALLY, AND SO SOMEONE IS
GETTING OLDER, YOU CAN'T FIRE

22
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:37,899
THEM JUST FOR BEING SLIGHTLY
OLDER OR NOT HIRE SOMEONE

23
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:40,969
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT HOT ENOUGH
BUT APPARENTLY, IF YOU ARE IN

24
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:46,030
QATAR NEAR LIKE THEY DON'T HAVE
THE SAME LAWS.

25
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,840
WE DO THAT ANYWAY AND WE RUB IT
IN.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,050
WHATEVER, I DON'T AGREE WITH
HIS STATEMENTS OBVIOUSLY,

27
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,310
AND HE IS VERY OLD-SCHOOL SO IT
IS JUST FUNNY BECAUSE WHEN

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,859
I LOOK AT HIM AND I HEAR HIS
STATEMENTS, I SEE AN OLD

29
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:06,630
SCHOOL, OLD WORLD KIND OF PERSON
AND THEN HE HAS THE AUDACITY

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,740
TO TALK ABOUT WOMEN BEING TOO
OLD TO BE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS.

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,740
WHATEVER.

32
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
THAT IS ANOTHER THING, RIGHT?

33
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,740
THIS WEIRD DOUBLE STANDARD WHERE
A WRINKLY DUDE LIKE THAT AND BY

34
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,740
THE WAY, HE IS DISHING IT OUT,
HE CAN STAND THERE AND TALK

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:14,740
ABOUT HOW WOMEN LOOK.

36
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,930
BECAUSE WOMEN ALWAYS NEED TO BE
YOUNG AND HOT BUT DUDES,

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,200
THEY CAN LET THEMSELVES GO.

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,810
REMEMBER WHEN THE DAD BUT THING
WAS A THING AND PEOPLE WERE LIKE

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,110
YEAH, DAD BOD, SUPERHOT.

40
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:29,340
HOW
ABOUT GUYS HAVE TO HAVE THE SAME

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,340
STANDARDS AS US.

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,490
CATCH ME OUTSIDE, HOW ABOUT
THAT?

43
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,400
BY THE WAY, I'M NOT ALL THAT
UP IN ARMS ABOUT THIS BUT

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,290
THERE WAS AN ANGLE TO THE STORY
THAT I WANTED TO BRING UP.

45
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:46,299
FOX NEWS REPORTED THIS AND THE
WHOLE TONE THAT THEY TOOK

46
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,330
WAS REINFORCING WHAT WE ARTIE
KNEW.

47
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:53,370
THIS GUY IN QATAR IS A
MISOGYNISTIC PRICK.

48
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,200
ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CARE ABOUT
WOMEN'S RIGHTS BUT WHEN IT

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,950
COMES TO TRUMP WANTING TO GRAB
WOMEN BY THE PUSSY, IT IS

50
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,170
JUST LOCKER ROOM TALK.

51
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,299
NOT A BIG DEAL.

52
00:03:02,299 --> 00:03:05,810
HE MOVED ON THEM LIKE A
BITCH, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

53
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,739
HE WAS JUST TRYING TO BUY THEM
FURNITURE, THAT'S ALL.

54
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,310
WE ARE CONSISTENT WITH
CONSISTENT OUT WE'RE

55
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,239
AGAINST MISOGYNY AROUND THE
WORLD.

56
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,761
BUT FOX, WHEN THEY HAVE THEIR
OWN VERSION OF SHARIA LAW, THE

57
00:03:17,761 --> 00:03:25,200
KIND OF LOVE IT, BUT THE MINUTE
IT IS A GUY IN QATAR INSTEAD OF

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,200
A WHITE GUY, AL BAKER A RIGHT
WING REPUBLICAN HERE THEY

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,250
WOULD BE LIKE WHAT'S THE BIG
DEAL?

60
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,970
WE JUST OF THE STORY TODAY ABOUT
HOW REPUBLICANS WERE GOING

61
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,690
TO THE OFFICE AND IN FRONT OF
THE OTHER EMPLOYEE FEMALE

62
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,189
EMPLOYEES TALKING ABOUT THE
LOBBYIST HITS WERE SO BIG,

63
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,750
I LOVE TO COMPARE THE SIZE OF
THE LOOK BOBBY IS TED'S.

64
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,250
THE REPUBLICANS ALIKE THAT'S
FINE, THAT'S LOCKER ROOM

65
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:50,510
TOPPLING THIS GUY.

66
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:54,700
THE REALITY IS, BOTH ARE BAD AND
YOU KNOW, HE WAS TALKING TO

67
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,120
BUSINESS PEOPLE THERE, SO HE WAS
LIKE DON'T THINK THE BUSINESS

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,550
CLASS, IF I HEARD HIM RIGHT, OF
THOSE AIRLINES.

69
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,290
IN OTHER WORDS, PROJECTION.

70
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,040
IF YOU ARE A HORNY OLD MAN LIKE
ME AND YOU WANT TO BE SERVED BY

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,950
ATTRACTIVE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS, I
WILL GET YOU YOUNG ATTRACTIVE

72
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,700
FLIGHT ATTENDANTS THAT WOULD
EVEN TO DO WITH THOSE GRANDMA'S?

73
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,700
HIT ON THEM?

74
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,480
YOU CAN EVEN SEXUALLY HARASSED
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT LIKE

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,810
YOU CAN ON QATAR AIRLINES TO

76
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,810
IN SUCH A SOFTY BECAUSE I
FEEL SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT I

77
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,810
MENTION THIS WRINKLY FACE
BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A LOW, STUPID

78
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:23,810
THING TO SAY BUT THE REASON I
BRING IT UP US TO SHOW THAT

79
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,810
DOUBLE STANDARD, THAT INABILITY
TO JUST REFLECT ON YOURSELF AND

80
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,810
REFLECT ON THE WAY YOU LOOK.

81
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,810
DO YOU HAVE THE SAME STANDARDS
FOR YOURSELF THAT YOU DO

82
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,810
FOR WOMEN?

83
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,810
PROBABLY NOT.

84
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,810
IT IS A
SOCIETAL THING.

85
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:30,810
IT IS NOT

86
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,810
JUST TRUE OF QATAR, IT'S
TRUE OF A LOT OF DIFFERENT

87
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:32,810
COUNTRIES SO IT IS FRUSTRATING
AND I DON'T KNOW.

88
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,810
LOOK, THE ENTITLEMENT THING
IS WHAT DRIVES ME CRAZY

89
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,810
BECAUSE HE THINKS NO, I AM A
RICH GUY FROM QATAR, I AM

90
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,810
ENTITLED A HOT, YOUNG WOMEN AND
THEY WILL LOVE ME BECAUSE I

91
00:04:35,810 --> 00:00:00,000
AM RICH AND I AM FROM QATAR.
