1
00:00:11,071 --> 00:00:13,006
>> WE HAVE RECEIVED NO FORMAL OR

2
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:14,375
INFORMAL NOTIFICATION OF

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:14,975
ANYTHING.

4
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,376
KIM JONG UN HAD SENT PREVIOUSLY

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,245
THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THE NEED AND

6
00:00:18,245 --> 00:00:20,514
AT THE OF THE UNITED STATES AND

7
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:24,151
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA CONTINUING

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,753
IN ITS JOINT EXERCISES.

9
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:28,756
THEY ARE EXERCISES THAT ARE

10
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:30,424
LEGAL, PLANNED WELL, WELL IN

11
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:30,758
ADVANCE.

12
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:32,860
>> THEY ARE NEGOTIATING

13
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,164
OVERLEVERAGED AND, NOW OUR

14
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:38,432
DIPLOMATS ARE GETTING SOME

15
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:40,200
INSIGHT AS TO WHERE NORTH KOREA

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,101
IS REALLY HEADING.

17
00:00:41,101 --> 00:00:42,836
>> I THINK NOT DOING MILITARY

18
00:00:42,836 --> 00:00:44,872
EXERCISES WOULD BE A SHARE, SO

19
00:00:44,872 --> 00:00:47,241
IN GOOD FAITH ON OUR PART, IT

20
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:48,142
DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING

21
00:00:48,142 --> 00:00:48,876
PERMANENTLY BUT DELAYING THAT

22
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:50,244
UNTIL AFTER TALKS WOULD BE A

23
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:53,147
GOOD IDEA.

24
00:00:53,147 --> 00:00:55,149
>> A REACTION FROM NORTH KOREA

25
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:56,250
TODAY THAT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT

26
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,318
THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.

27
00:00:58,318 --> 00:01:00,554
SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM THAT THEY

28
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:04,558
MAY CANCEL THE UPCOMING SUMMIT,

29
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:05,159
JUNE 12TH, BETWEEN

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,760
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND KIM JONG UN.

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,728
THE NORTH KOREAN STATEMENT

32
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:09,163
SAYING THIS EXERCISE TARGETING

33
00:01:09,163 --> 00:01:11,331
US, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT ACROSS

34
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:12,065
SOUTH KOREA AND TARGETING US IS

35
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:17,538
A FLAGRANT CHALLENGE TO THE

36
00:01:17,538 --> 00:01:18,539
DECLARATION AND MILITARY

37
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,807
PROVOCATION, WHEN ENCOUNTERED TO

38
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:21,442
THE POSSIBLE TO ELEMENT ON THE

39
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:22,376
KOREAN PENINSULA.

40
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,344
THE UNITED STATES WILL HAVE TO

41
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:25,345
UNDERTAKE CAREFUL DELIBERATIONS

42
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:27,347
ABOUT THE FATE OF THE PLANNED

43
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:29,950
NORTH KOREA AND U.S. SUMMIT IN

44
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,552
LIGHT OF THIS PROVOCATIVE

45
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:32,953
MILITARY RUCKUS JOINTLY

46
00:01:32,953 --> 00:01:33,987
CONDUCTED WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN

47
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:34,755
AUTHORITIES.

48
00:01:34,755 --> 00:01:36,557
SO, WHAT ABOUT THIS RUCKUS,

49
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:38,158
WHERE THIS LEADS AND WHAT IS IT?

50
00:01:38,158 --> 00:01:41,595
LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL.

51
00:01:41,595 --> 00:01:44,164
JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, PHILIP

52
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:46,200
BUMP, AND STEVEN HILTON, FORMER

53
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,334
ADVISOR TO BRITISH

54
00:01:47,334 --> 00:01:48,569
PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON AND

55
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,137
HOST OF THE NEXT REVOLUTION HERE

56
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:52,973
ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

57
00:01:52,973 --> 00:01:54,541
STEVE, IT SEEMS LIKE POSTURING.

58
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:56,543
IS THIS THING FALLING APART, DO

59
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:56,910
WE THINK?

60
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,680
>> I THINK IT'S PERFECTLY

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,149
POSSIBLE THIS IS PART OF THE

62
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,950
CHOREOGRAPHY.

63
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,884
WE NEVER, JUST AS WHAT

64
00:02:03,884 --> 00:02:06,753
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING IS SEEN

65
00:02:06,753 --> 00:02:08,521
HERE AS A BIG RISK, IT'S ALSO

66
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:10,858
LIKELY THAT BACK IN NORTH KOREA,

67
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:12,559
WHAT KIM IS DOING IS SEEN AS A

68
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,261
RISK AND HE MAY HAVE PEOPLE AND

69
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,964
FACTIONS THERE THAT HE NEEDS TO

70
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:18,699
PLACATE TO SHOW THAT HE'S NOT

71
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:19,399
CAVING IN.

72
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,367
AND THERE'S THIS DELICATE DANCE

73
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:21,702
THAT HAS TO BE DONE TO GET TO

74
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:24,171
THAT SUMMIT.

75
00:02:24,171 --> 00:02:26,273
I THINK THE RESPONSE FROM

76
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,342
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE CRUCIAL.

77
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:29,843
HE WANTS THIS REALLY BADLY, AND

78
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:31,545
I THINK HE'S GOING TO DO

79
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:33,113
EVERYTHING TO HERD THE CATS THE

80
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:35,749
RIGHT WAY TO GET IN THAT SUMMIT.

81
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:36,950
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT

82
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,785
TO SEE HIS RESPONSE AND I THINK

83
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:40,153
THAT MATTERS MUCH MORE THAN

84
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:42,155
ANYTHING WE HEAR FROM OUR

85
00:02:42,155 --> 00:02:42,523
DIPLOMATS.

86
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:44,491
>> Bret: IF YOU HEARD

87
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,260
RAND PAUL SAY, IS NOT SO BAD

88
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,663
THAT WE STOP THE MILITARY

89
00:02:49,663 --> 00:02:50,030
EXERCISES.

90
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,765
THE PEOPLE AT THE PENTAGON'S

91
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:52,966
HEADS WOULD EXPLODE IT BECAUSE

92
00:02:52,966 --> 00:02:55,235
THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR SO

93
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:57,104
TO THE REGION TO CONTINUE TO DO

94
00:02:57,104 --> 00:02:58,171
IT.

95
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,374
>> IT CERTAINLY IS DOWN THE

96
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:01,074
LINE, I THINK EVERYONE WOULD

97
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:03,777
LIKE TO SEE A SCENARIO WHERE

98
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:04,578
SETS OF EXERCISES ARE LESS

99
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:05,379
NECESSARY.

100
00:03:05,379 --> 00:03:06,780
THE CRITICAL POINT IS,

101
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,881
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GONE AGAINST

102
00:03:07,881 --> 00:03:09,650
HIS ART OF THE DEAL MENTALITY

103
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,752
AND PUT HIS CARDS ON THE TABLE.

104
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:13,253
HIS CARDS ARE, I VERY MUCH WANT

105
00:03:13,253 --> 00:03:15,188
THIS THING TO HAPPEN.

106
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:17,057
I THINK NORTH KOREA RECOGNIZE US

107
00:03:17,057 --> 00:03:19,960
TO SOME THAT THAT GIVES HIM

108
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,694
LEVERAGE OVER THE UNITED STATES

109
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:21,361
AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THIS

110
00:03:21,361 --> 00:03:24,731
MOMENT TO TRY TO TWIST SOME ARMS

111
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,465
COME AND KNOWING PRESIDENT TRUMP

112
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:28,535
HAS SAID I HOPE TO WIN THE NOBEL

113
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:30,103
PEACE PRIZE, BUT HE HINTED HE

114
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:31,939
WOULD HELP THERE WOULD BE SOME

115
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:32,506
RECOGNITION FOR THIS.

116
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:36,944
IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE,

117
00:03:36,944 --> 00:03:37,644
NORTH KOREA IS ALSO A LITTLE

118
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:39,546
INCENSED IN THE WAY THAT THE

119
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,581
UNITED STATES HAS SORT OF

120
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:42,549
ASSUMED OWNERSHIP OVER THAT OF

121
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:43,750
ELEMENTS ON THE KOREAN

122
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,484
PENINSULA, AND THIS COULD ALSO

123
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:48,889
BE TO SOME EXTENT AND A REACTION

124
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,258
OF THAT.

125
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:54,761
>> IT COULD BE SOME POSTURING,

126
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,063
TRYING TO SHOW STRENGTH COMING

127
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:57,264
UP TO THE SUMMIT, BUT WE HAVE

128
00:03:57,264 --> 00:04:01,602
ALSO SEEN IN THE PAST, 1992,

129
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,971
20,002,007, BUT THEY HAD NICE

130
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:04,705
WORDS ABOUT MOVING TOWARD MORE

131
00:04:04,705 --> 00:04:10,777
OF A PIECE, AND IT ENDED UP

132
00:04:10,777 --> 00:04:15,349
BEING NOTHING TOWARD THE REGIME.

133
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:16,750
>> Bret: BASICALLY LOOKING AT

134
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,884
NORTH KOREA'S PAST, THEY HAVEN'T

135
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:19,952
BEEN GREAT ABOUT KEEPING UP WITH

136
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:20,420
THEIR PROMISES.

137
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,024
>> NOT AT ALL.

138
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:27,060
WHEN CONGRESS WOMAN MICK SALLY

139
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,263
AND US WERE HERE, I AGREE WITH

140
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:32,366
HER BUT I WONDER IF OUR

141
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,735
DIPLOMATS OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN

142
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:35,302
THAT THIS WAS COMING?

143
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:38,639
I MEAN CERTAINLY, KIM KNEW THAT

144
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,107
THESE EXERCISES WERE GOING TO

145
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:40,507
TAKE PLACE.

146
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:44,244
RAND PAUL IS MY DEAR FRIEND BUT

147
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,546
YOU ARE RIGHT, THE MILITARY

148
00:04:46,546 --> 00:04:47,080
HEADS WOULD EXPLODE.

149
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,183
IT'S TOO LATE      LATE TO STOPT

150
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:50,217
IT'S TOO LATE      LATE TO STOPI

151
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:50,484
IT'S TOO LATE      LATE TO STOPS

152
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:50,784
THING.

153
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:52,352
THE COST WOULD BE FAR TOO MUCH

154
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,721
AND THE IMPLICATION OF STOPPING

155
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,990
IT IS SO CONTRARY TO EVERYTHING

156
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,958
DONALD TRUMP STANDS FOR.

157
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,227
>> Bret: WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY

158
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:01,361
STRENGTH.

159
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:02,362
>> CORRECT.

160
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:04,064
SO EITHER WE DIDN'T KNOW THIS

161
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:05,666
WAS COMING, OR WE POORLY

162
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,267
PREPARED AND THIS IS THE WAY WE

163
00:05:07,267 --> 00:05:08,168
ARE.

164
00:05:08,168 --> 00:05:10,771
AND AS STEVE SAID COMPANY HAS TO

165
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:11,838
APPEAL TO HIS BASE.

166
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:13,040
IT'S NOT A NATIONWIDE BASE, IT'S

167
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,842
A SMALL BASE, BUT TO ENSURE TO

168
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:19,579
SEE HOW HE STAYS IN TUB POWER.

169
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:21,848
>> Bret: THEN WE HAVE ZTE COME

170
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:23,383
THIS CHINESE COMPANY AND A WALK

171
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:25,986
BACK OF WHAT WERE GOING TO BE

172
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:26,586
SANCTIONS AGAINST THIS.

173
00:05:26,586 --> 00:05:28,155
I SAW ON TWITTER AS SOMEONE

174
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:28,822
SPECULATE IN THAT MAYBE KIM

175
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,724
LOOKED AT THAT AND SAID, I WANT

176
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:32,626
A PIECE OF THAT.

177
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,062
MAYBE I SHOULD ASK FOR SOME TOO.

178
00:05:35,062 --> 00:05:37,064
>> THAT'S ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT

179
00:05:37,064 --> 00:05:37,564
IT.

180
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:39,066
I THINK THE SOPHISTICATION OF

181
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:39,866
THE DIFFERENT PLAYERS HERE IS

182
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:41,768
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN'T BE

183
00:05:41,768 --> 00:05:42,369
CERTAIN ABOUT.

184
00:05:42,369 --> 00:05:46,573
I THINK THE CHINESE DEFINITELY

185
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:48,442
FEEL, AS YOU ARE SAYING, BECAUSE

186
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,544
THE PRESIDENT WANTS THIS SO

187
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:51,778
BADLY, THEY HAVE SOME LEVERAGE

188
00:05:51,778 --> 00:05:52,245
HERE.

189
00:05:52,245 --> 00:05:54,047
>> Bret: IN THAT CASE, THE

190
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,349
CHINESE DEAL WITH TRADE.

191
00:05:56,349 --> 00:05:57,084
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

192
00:05:57,084 --> 00:06:00,721
BUT IF HE DOES ONE DEAL, THAT'S

193
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:00,987
ONE.

194
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:06,460
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASED

195
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,562
SCRUTINY ACROSS THE SPECTRUM,

196
00:06:08,562 --> 00:06:10,764
NOT JUST THIS BIG ONE BUT

197
00:06:10,764 --> 00:06:12,466
THROUGHOUT THE TECHNOLOGY DEALS,

198
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:13,300
I THINK OVERALL THE STANCE

199
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,968
TOWARDS CHINA IS WAY TOUGHER

200
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:17,003
THAN IT WAS BEFORE AND I THINK

201
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:18,171
THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE.

202
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:20,574
BUT TO GET THIS DELICATE PROCESS

203
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:22,375
ON AND KEEPING IT ON THE ROAD,

204
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,944
YOU MAY NEED TO GIVE THE ODD

205
00:06:23,944 --> 00:06:29,916
CONCESSION HERE AND NOW.

206
00:06:29,916 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THAT'S WHY POMPEO WAS OUT
