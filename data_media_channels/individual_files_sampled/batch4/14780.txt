pity the life of those in the advertising business these days one must be so careful not to offend when it comes to any implied racism or sexism or homophobia or Islamophobia so many other isms and phobias and this just in folks apparently facial expressions and ads can be triggering to the usual suspects you're not gonna believe this one advertising long ago fell to the tyranny of political correctness and so it is that the bimbo has been replaced by the himbo that the frito Bandito was long ago expunged from active duty and if you need someone to play an idiot in an advertisement well you better make sure that character is a childlike male not a female but now apparently facial expressions and ads are triggering and offensive case in point a yahoo dot CA peace examines the degrading makeover ad campaign from the interior lottery corporation regarding its scratch game instant bingo gracious that sounds serious degrading surely the OLG didn't have some tart posing in a bikini made out of scratch tickets or something nope rather here is one of those offending OLG ads that runs for all of three seconds I'm going to play it a couple of times and you tell me why it's supposedly offside according to the perpetually offended bingo I have a feeling you're stumped right I mean what was offensive about that after all a woman raised her eyebrows and smiled that's it that's all well apparently a woman raising her eyebrows after presumably winning a sum of money is offside for being sexist but how so why so well it's never really explained but check out the responses from social media quote nothing makes me spend my money on false hope more than blatant sexism end quote that pithy process from someone called nothing to offer at least that name offers truth in advertising but wait there's more consider this tweet from someone called Kali girl quote quite possibly the most offensive degrading campaign ever end quote what it is like she just saw a litter of kittens being boiled alive and how is eyebrow raising sexist I mean how is the raising of eyebrows exclusively a female thing to don't men do it as well like Star Trek's mr. Spock oh and how about the rock from his WWE days and holy headgear check out TVs Batman yeah he's even got raised eyebrows inscribed on his mask that's right Robin our first full-length motion picture feature in color opens a whole new world of thrills why is this issue even an issue look far be it for me to go to bat for an Theriault scandal played gambling monopoly but even the odious OLG doesn't deserve to get raked over the coals by the usual suspects for a completely innocuous ad campaign or have we entered the final frontier of offensiveness namely are we now in a realm in which the snowflakes are imagining sexism where it simply doesn't exist all because presumably they need to be angry about something anything in order to fuel their perpetually offended status in the aftermath vol G issued a statement in which it said the intent of the campaign was not to enrage people and then the olg promptly pulled the campaign another entity capitulating yet again to society's lunatic fringe I'm prompted to raise a Sparky and eyebrow here but I wouldn't want to trigger anyone for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's I'd Menzies hey folks you may have heard about the new app the rebel has yes download that app and take the rebel with you wherever you go you
