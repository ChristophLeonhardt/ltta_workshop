since early November Saudi Arabia has
been blockading Yemen and that's plunged
the war-ravaged country into an even
deeper humanitarian crisis
nail-bitter no kumamon where rubbish we
eat rubbish and with drink from rubbish
and if anyone accuses us of lying
they can come to us and witness
everything with their own eyes
why here looking for food who have no
work no workplaces that is why we work
here
