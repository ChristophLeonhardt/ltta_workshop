00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,379
The design of this Little Trees car freshener goes way back to 1952 in Watertown, New York.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,500
And an unhappy milkman who was complaining to one of his customers

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,940
about the bad smell of spoiled milk.

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:22,120
Lucky for him, he was talking to Julius Samann, a Jewish chemist who’d fled from Nazi Germany

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:27,560
and spent time living in the forests of Canada
studying the aroma of alpine trees.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,360
After his chance encounter with the milkman, Samann started to create

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,660
paper soaked in natural pine oil.

8
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,930
A string was also attached to stop people
getting the perfume all over their hands.

9
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,590
The freshener was originally in the shape
of a buxom pin up girl, but Samann changed

10
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,190
his design to the pine tree we know today.

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,800
This allowed the cellophane wrapper to be
rolled down slowly, so the fragrance would

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,390
last that little bit longer.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,800
As the automotive industry took off so
did Little Trees.

14
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,820
Filling the air with classics like Black Ice,
Royal Pine, Vanillaroma

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,320
and of course New Car Scent.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,100
Fragrant and affordable, this is the design
that brings you

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,720
the heady aroma of a Canadian woodland.

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:00:00,000
Whether you’re in a milk cart or a taxi
cab.
