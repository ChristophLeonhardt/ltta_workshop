everyday Americans need a champion and I want to be that champion when Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists and some I assume are good people I am officially running for president of the United States who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican Party and that is that the American people your Damn emails Donald J Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on times property or let me talk quiet he'll pass the time that's all of his donors and special interests we have systemic racism and injustice and inequities in our country and in particular in our justice system that must be addressed and must be ended here's what I know Donald Trump is a phony a fraud his promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University I don't know what's in his heart but I do think hope and believe that he's going to improve the tenor of the campaign although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case and I intend to do everything I can to make certain she will be the next president of the United States by humbly and gratefully accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States accept your nomination former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stumbling as she left the 9/11 commemoration in New York City this point you have no plan educate oh I do yeah I have no plan that was locker room talk I'm not proud of it I am a person who has great respect for people from my family for the people of this country and certainly I'm not proud of it it's a tradition in this country in fact one of the prize of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard what a campaign is that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country are you saying you're not prepared now to caucuses that I will tell you at the time I'll keep you in suspense
