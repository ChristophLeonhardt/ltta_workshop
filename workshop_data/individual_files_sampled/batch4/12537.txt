there's a story in the New Testament that I've always found kind of bizarre I mean it's about a miracle so it's bizarre right there but that's not what really bothers me about it the disciples are going across the Sea of Galilee heading into the wind the waves are high and they look over and they see Jesus walking to them on the water you've all heard of this story they're walking to the water and they're terrified and they cry out it's a ghost but immediately Jesus spoke to them and he says take heart in his I do not be afraid now once their fear passes Peter who is kind of an excitable guy he gets excited and he wants to join in the fun and he says lord if it is you command me to come to you on the water and Jesus says come ahead so Peter gets out of the boat and he walks on the water and he comes to Jesus but what he saw oh I the wind was he got scared and he began to sink and he cried out lord save me and Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him saying to him oh you of little faith why did you doubt now obviously it's strange that the guys walking on the water but would always gets me about this story is Jesus says oh you of little faith and I think really the guy even if you took one step water that would be a lot of faith why is Jesus saying that he doesn't have enough faith when he actually there for a minute was walking on the water but Jesus was in the tradition of Hebrew prophets and a lot of what he did like the Hebrew prophets the Jewish prophets is he would act stuff out as a kind of a story that he was telling and so everything he did had double meanings and it it strikes me about this story when I think about it that everybody all the time all of us are walking on water right we never know what's gonna happen next we can be hit by a bolt of lightning we run over by a car we can lose everything we love we can you know terrible things can happen great things can happen we just don't know if you've ever talked to a hypochondriac and I I went through in my youth I went through it a very brief horrible period of hypochondria you know they make perfect sense they tell you you know people really do get Ellis really could happen in that statistics they and they make perfect sense even in some ways in some ways it's unreasonable to face life with confidence and yet of course if you face life with confidence if you do what Jesus says and you hold take hold of his hand and you walk on the water or uncertainty you're gonna have a much better life and part of this is because life is what's called a level 2 chaotic system level 2 chaotic systems are systems that where you can't predict what's going to happen next because even your predictions affect the outcome so for instance if I said to you I you know remember that Tom Cruise movie was based on a philip k dick story where they have these people who could tell crimes and they would go and bust the criminal before it took place Minority Report write that the problem with that is you would go await the guy didn't commit the crime you arrested him for crime you said he was gonna commit and you don't know if he was gonna commit it that's a level two Kaos system the prediction of the crime causes them to stop the crime and therefore the crime doesn't take place and the prediction is incorrect right the stock market is a level two chaos a system so you've noticed the stock market's going up down to took a terrible plunge yesterday wasn't that terrible if you measure it in percentages it's gone so far up there was only a three or four percent drop but it's climbing now today it's coming back and you're seeing the different reactions to it people saying oh my god mostly the Republicans saying it's gonna be fine don't worry about it and of course the Democrats and the media but I repeat myself the Democrats and their media are saying oh it's a disaster Trump has killed us all is going to kill us all the thing about in a level to chaos system the reactions to uncertainty don't tell you anything about what's going to happen next they only tell you about the person who is speaking what do they tell you well we're about to find out trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show Kurt Warner not Tim Tebow you know I thought for a minute I had gone nuts yesterday I was talking about the fact that no you know the quarterback for the Eagles believed in Christ and it brought him back from his moment of need and I could sit and I said was like Tim Tebow but I meant and and Rob was saying no he never won a Super Bowl I thought I must have gone insane I remember him winning the Super Bowl and he was a stock boy and he was out of football was Kurt Warner even look-alike Kurt Warner and Tim Tebow his Kurt Warner and the message remains the same have faith here - speaking of faith there are two nice things that happened to me I just want to tell you about one of them is last year I wrote a short story called all our yesterday's a mystery story took place in England during World War one and it was published in Ellery Queen mystery magazine and when the Edgar Award the nominations were announced I was very disappointed that it wasn't nominated for an award because I really did think it was one of my better short stories but I just heard that it is going to be included in the best American mystery stories anthology from houghton mifflin harcourt which is a very prestigious anthology and really does keep stories alive so that's like the third time I've been in it and I was really happy to hear that also I got a note today from a guy I know in the sort of speechwriting staff of the White House and I don't know if this is I can't vouch for this but he told me that when they were writing the State of the Union address they read my piece about george w bush and the movie Batman The Dark Knight and that inspired them or helped inspire them to put the hero theme in this speech so if that speech has an effect it's all me Oh after this I'm gonna you just gonna see a streak at the end of the show my airplane yeah I hope it's parked outside because in LA traffic I'm never gonna get there in time I've been going to Washington DC for the prayer breakfast which I really enjoyed last week I will actually get to see from a distance you know the president and the in the distance so you know while I'm there right remember I was talking about da Vinci and how they will drench you in office I'm not doing that but they have another service they have another service that is really also very good if you were running a business like I have a business on my writing is a business my literary career is a business and it runs out of my house not only out of my house it runs out of a little outhouse on my property you guys will you happen because you didn't come to my Christmas party but everybody else is saying so it really is the size of an outhouse out on my patio and I go in there and write and that's my business and it's not the greatest business address and I don't always want people writing to my home da Vinci now has what they call a virtual office where they will give you a business address that has actually at a place of business that you can if you want to rent from them if you need it if you need to do a meeting so for a starting at $50 a month you can how have a well you're looking at me like I said as you said Tim dude no it's it's a really great starting at $50 a month you can have an address that people can write to people can contact that will be a

topic a little bit but I'm gonna come back to this I have to start with this interesting Trudeau thing if you haven't seen this it really is worth seeing Justin Trudeau held a town hall I'm gonna get back to the stock market and the reactions to it and the the FBI and all that but Justin Trudeau the Prime Minister of Canada held a town hall and received a question from the audience and here is his answer maternal love is the love that's going to change the future of mankind so we'd like you to look we would like to say people kind of this early mankind now I'm coming I'm gonna come back to this at the end of the show but I just want you to know if anybody does that you ever ever there's a simple answer you say I didn't ask you how to speak I don't accept your right to tell me what words to use I repeat the question in the same language answer the question that's what you say whenever they do it whenever they do when they tell you no bill McGurn had a piece in The Wall Street Journal they're trying to get rid of the Fighting Irish logo from Ireland just say we didn't ask you we don't care what you think we will move forward as we see fit we're not here to be told so all right the stock market took a dive yesterday I hear it's climbing back as we speak no one you know the thing about the stock market is nobody knows why the stock market does what it does best analysis I've heard is it has to do with this quantitative easing where they basically force everybody into riskier stocks and it's over you know this stock work has been climbing so fast there's kind of outstripped the assumed worth of some of the companies but even that the worth of the companies is just something people make up it's just something people they have people you know think those companies out here are two visions of what happened first from The Wall Street Journal which is all about Wall Street and they know about money they say the paradox of this correction is that it's taking place as the economy looks stronger than it's been since at least 2005 and maybe since 1999 the is M non-manufacturing index for january rolled into 59.9 on Monday which means a near boom in the service economy New Order's Index surged to sixty two point seven from fifty four point five in December the employment index hit sixty one point six from fifty six point three this is the latest signal that the US economy has climbed to a new higher growth plateau from burrow Obama's secular stagnation discounting for noise in the GDP figures the economy has grown at about three percent on an annual basis since last May and with tax reform now kicking in growth could be even faster in 2018 it could at the extreme even rise above five percent which be which would be insane now let's travel over to our friends at the New York Times and well let's go right to knucklehead row so a knucklehead row of all the knuckleheads they're the knucklehead iasts has got to be paul krugman i do not believe a word that comes out of him is has any reference at all to the truth charles blow is a hysterical girl you know like hysterical twelve-year-old girl then that's one thing but but Krugman is just like saying stuff and he's won Nobel Prize for economy which apparently he deserved because before he became a partisan he invented some theory that was very important for economists but since then it's all been this kind of nonsense and he writes a piece one day this is two days I guess when their stocks took a die for two days has Trump thoria hit a wall finally hit a wall so this is the guy who said when Trump was elected and there was a stock dip he said this is never they're never gonna recover so now he says first he goes through this long thing about how the market has nothing to do with the economy doesn't mean an economy may be strong there's good news but but market turmoil and every you know how it is everything before the but is always nonsense market turmoil should make us take a hard look at the economy's prospects and what the data say I'd argue is that at the very least America is heading for a downhill shift in its growth rate the available evidence suggests that growth over the next decade will be something like 1.5 percent a year not the three percent Donald Trump and his minions keep promising so we're hearing three to five from The Wall Street Journal one point five from the New York Times let's see in the next year who comes closer to the truth you know by the way just to put this in out there Trump it with is foolish to keep using the stock market as an indication of how the economy works that's it that's on him that's on Donald Trump because the stock market will dip at times it's going to go down and then you get the blame if you took the credit there's all kinds of good things happening in the economy that he definitely can take the credit for he should just say it is wonderful that the stock market we know that goes up and down but you know that's wonderful thing that is going up but he does take too much credit for it so I just want to just compare just overall the attitude that Donald Trump is bringing to the country after eight years of Obama apologizing for America and just compare it to what the Democrats are actually trying to sell you Trump gave a speech yesterday touting the economy and he called a worker up to talk about what he's going to do with his thousand dollar bonus that he got because of the tax cuts and here is here's the worker yeah he got the cut okay with the tax cut and the bonus I will be trying to save up money to start a family and eventually get a bigger house so I like that in terms of the bonus that corporate America received versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of but the schmooze Owen is so pathetic it's like standing with the worker the guy got a thousand bucks a day you know what I saved this if I do this right and I work maybe I'll get a little extra pay I can start a family I can buy our house and joke is gone yeah babe yeah this is the way to do it and what you what's so offensive about what Pelosi says is that you know the they keep telling you like Snopes as this you know left-wing fact-check they call it and the and Google Riggs it so Snopes comes up when you google Pelosi saying crumbs they so what's the context well the context is envy it's not what you have that matters it's that the other guy has more okay what's it to me I don't care if some guys got a billion dollars as long as I've got what I want what do I care this guy's starting to fit he's not a billionaire he's starting a family who's buying a house he's thinking about hasn't got open for the future that's crumbs it's crumbs compared to them the other thing I mean even moving away from the stock market just talking about this memo that came out that the left is trying to now now this is really interesting now they're gonna release they voted to release the Democrat memo and interestingly all the Republicans said released the memo whereas when they released the Republican memo all the Democrats said no I you know I I never know with this whether it's smart for the Republicans to play nice and say we're much better than you or they should play the same hardball Democrats and say now we have the majority you're not releasing it take a hike about bouncing but just even the way this is going I just want to compare the attitude of these two sides right and here's Trump with the entire media and the Democrats selling everybody that this memo is Spira see it's a nothing burger it's a dud right Trump comes out I think this is cut yeah it's number nine number nine listen to his reaction to the memo or it all goes back to where it was and worse oh but did we catch them they are very embarrassed they never thought their way to get caught we caught them hey we caught of a great time it's so much fun let's see if Chuck Schumer's have any great time play that Schumer clip we are dealing with probably the most dangerous and worst man in the presidency we have ever had in the history of this nation but we are gonna win the fight if we can take back the Senate that means that I will have the sole power to determine what goes on the floor of the Senate and that will mean we will not get another backward right-wing judge on the Supreme Court period it means we'll be able to stop Donald Trump from putting all is junk on the floor and stop the anti LGBT cascade of things that come into the United States said it so keep up the activism keep up the protests keep up the calling keep up everything that you do and we will take this country back thank you and god bless you Chuck does not look happy it's all I'm saying here is in a inula you know history is a level-two chaos chaotic system and some of the predictions and some of the attitudes you bring to it determine the history I'm not talking about that power of positive thinking I'm not talking about Joel Osteen stuff where you just just always expect the best I'm talking about having confidence that you're doing what you're supposed to be doing using your wisdom cultivating your wisdom using that to guide you having confidence that God will be there in a fix and a necessity and going forward believing that you're going in the right direction who's doing that right now who is doing that the stock market is reacting to trump the stock market is a completely irrational system as far as I can tell and it really is reacting to the absolute attitude of fun and optimism that this guy has sometimes sometimes where you look at him and you think like I don't even know what he's so happy about but he is absolutely having a good time let me again compare Adam Schiff and I I have said everything I have to say about Adam chef I just think he's a McCarthy guy bad guy he really is is not an honest guy and he's not an honest broker of information but we're talking about you know let's do it this way Sarah Sanders was talking they were saying to her about this Donald Trump jr. meeting that they think his treasonous and all this and she just gave the entire Russia collusion story she just put it in perspective this clip is a little bit long but it really is worth this is clip number six she puts the entire thing in perspective everybody wants to try to make this some story about misleading the only thing I've seen misleading is a year's worth of stories that have been fueling a false narrative about this Russia collusion and based on phony scam based on anonymous sources and I think that is if we're gonna talk about misleading that's the only thing misleading I see in this entire process you guys are focused on a meeting that Don junior had no consequence when the Democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like Ukraine the Democrat linked firm fusion GPS actually took money from the Russian government while it created the phony dossier that's been the basis for all of the Russia scandal fake news and if you want to talk further about a relationship with Russia look no further than the Clintons as we've said time and time again Bill Clinton was paid half a million dollars to give a speech to a Russian bank and was personally thanked by Putin for it Hillary Clinton allowed 1/5 of America's uranium to reserve to be sold to a Russian firm whose investors were Clinton foundation donors and the Clinton campaign Chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on Russia's largest bank and failed to report it if you guys want to talk about having relations which you've seen them cess with doing look no further than their if you want to talk about somebody who's actually been tough on Russia look at President Trump he wants more fracking more coal more energy so she's telling you there's wrongdoing on the Democrat side and Trump is being tough on Russia now listen to what Adam Schiff says about this Russia collusion thing listen to what the vision that he's putting forward again this is cut number five as you have seen they parroted black lives matter to try to broaden the racial divide in this country fascinatingly they also trumpeted the second amendment apparently the Russians are very big fans of our Second Amendment they don't particularly want a second Amendment of their own but they're really glad that we have one so he's saying not only not only black lives matter which was virtually a creation of Barack Obama to cover up for his mouth Easons in office but he's he's saying our Second Amendment is a Russian they the Russians are promoting the Second Amendment so all kill each other I mean he's giving you a not not a vision of Republican wrongdoing which would be one thing he's give me this complete vision that your country is completely taken over is completely out of control and I just want to finish this with Hillary Clinton because if you want to be happy I'm sure some of you were just so sorry she was not elected hahaha but if you want to just remind yourself of how happy you are that Hillary Clinton was not elected president she was giving a talk and answering some questions the other day I'm all I'm talking about is the vision of the world a vision that helps create the world that will be what kind of people reelect and what kind of visions we have actually helped create the world that's going to be so Hillary is out there and she was asked about climate change and she was asked if women you know like the old funny New York time at headline world World Ends women and blacks worst-affected they've asked if women would bear the brunt of climate change listen carefully to this responses cut 12 with respect to the rest of the world I would say that particularly for women you're absolutely right they will bear the brunt of looking for the food looking for the firewood looking for the place to migrate to when all of the grass is finally gone as the desert vacation moves south and you have to keep moving your livestock or your crops are no longer growing they're burning up in the intense heat that we're now seeing reported across North Africa into the Middle East and into India so yes women once again will be the primary primarily burdened with the problems of climate change it's the apocalypse in her imagination it's the apocalypse and the girls he's talking to all these young girls at Georgetown University and they're smiling and nodding yes well it's gonna be Mad Max and we're gonna get it you know and it's gonna be bad for women that's the worst thing it's gonna be unfair to him not only is the world gonna end it's gonna be unfair to women just stuff that you imagine the attitude that you take into life is going to affect the way the future goes and it's certainly going to affect the very moment you're living in who do you want in power power the guy who thinks that tomorrow it's all gonna be desert and you know and despair or the guy who's having a good time thinks we're doing pretty well which in fact we are so you're probably looking at how clean my shirt is and thinking that I'm about to do a tie dad but no

Stephen ID he works on public administration public finance political theory and urban policy that's Manhattan Institute is the Institute that publishes City Journal where I sometimes write I am a contributing editor there I has worked on his work has appeared in Politico the New York Post a week in standard City Journal and I wanted to talk to him because he's an expert in homelessness and I've just been noticing certainly in LA it's partly in New York it's just getting so bad and this has nothing to do you know Republicans complain that they only talk about homelessness when a Republican is in power this to me is something we should be leftist and conservatives should be able to agree on that people should not be living in the streets and I just want to ask him where this came from and why it got started here is Steven I'd from the Manhattan Institute Steven thanks so much for coming on I really appreciate it you grabbed me you know I and I the reason I wanted to talk to you is I was in New York over Christmas it was maybe I don't know it felt like it was five below zero I was walking around and and all over town and I remember this when I lived in a New York in the 70s all over town people there were homeless people on the street and I thought to myself it this shit this is not right this is not right and conservatives know it's not right and left us no it's not right and somehow there between those two sides there ought to be something we could do about it so I wanted to talk to you about it first of all we didn't always have this problem I mean this is one of the things that really bothers me when I was a kid there were not homeless people I mean obviously there were always hobos and beggars but there was not this kind of villages of homeless people on the street what happened well yeah we it was not a problem that we called homelessness as you say we had different terms that we used hobos bums vagrants in most American cities going back you know the earlier part of the 20th century you know cities did serve as kind of pools of transient labor foreign industrializing economies that he's attracted guy to come and work for temporary periods of time and and then they would be you know the work could be interrupted and they would congregate a neighbor at the neighborhood started to form around the kind of housing and employment opportunities that that service transient laborers like I'm thinking of the term Skid Row neighborhood in LA there's still this neighborhood called scape group but their Skid Row neighborhoods all over American cities in the New York City it was called the Bowery on the Lower East Side and that was a place where you know single men probably the high rate of alcoholism who had whatever reason had been detached for their family these were kind of like the losers of industrial think capitalism but they had a place where they could like find a room for the night at dirt cheap phrases his single room occupancy hotels opportunities for spot labor if they want to do that bars etc so there were these kind of neighborhoods that were like just for what we might call now homeless guys those neighborhoods were dismantled as a result of housing regulations urban renewal pushes but basically because we didn't want people to live like that anymore we didn't want these conditions to persist so we got rid of those neighborhoods so we spread the problem out throughout this city as opposed to having it concentrated in one neighborhood so now they're in libraries and Parks train stations a lot of those guys would have been in the Skid Row neighborhoods traditionally speaking so that's why the presence has become more visible as you say interesting and and it also seems I mean I know that a lot of our psychiatric hospitals have kind of disappear and the idea of institutionalizing people and a lot of the people on I see on the street seem to me to be mentally ill does that feed into this is that part of the problem that there's no care for the mentally ill yeah the process that we now refer to as the institutionalization got going in the 50s the institutionalized population peaked at 560 thousand in 1955 and it's been going down since for various reasons we decided we didn't want to keep people in an inpatient setting we wanted to try to provide them with mental health care in communities it was a disaster everyone agreed it did not play out in the way that its architects envisioned and so at present somewhere between 1/4 to 1/3 of the homeless adult population have a serious mental illness and that is certainly an important driver of the problems well ok now you've been very you you wrote a piece in City Journal I don't mean to read you your own stuff but our audience hasn't heard it so just read one little paragraph here you said during New York's battle days which I remember doing during New York's battle days mayor's got re-elected while presiding over murder rates that look like a humanitarian crisis from a contemporary perspective the voting public is now at risk of settling into a similar complacency on homelessness we see this in LA I mean if you go down to City Hall in LA there are ten villages there and nobody seems to care nobody seems to to react and say it be saying to the government what are you gonna do you have been very critical of your Communist mayor de Blasio they are what is he doing wrong well you know there the New York City has this system of homeless services that has been built up over many decades you know we got wrong on we got off on the wrong path in this thing a long time ago there is for example in New York City this right to shelter law which confers on everybody the immediate right to for the city to provide you with temporary housing that night and this is cause this is probably pushed down the unsheltered population somewhat but has caused the homeless population in general to swell and has also caused the quality of services that the city can provide to homeless people to really diminish because they're just constantly in triage mode so you know we do have like quality providers of homeless services there are good shelters who work to like you know connect guys with job training get them back on their feet but it's harder for those people to do their work when there's just this constant pressure from from the right to shelter and other factors pushing the population the homeless population up and up and up and up I mean it's a structural problem the economy's bad homelessness goes up the economy is good almost keeps going up in you know it's like they're murdering was always just you can't help it we've got two thousand murders here this is the kind of city we are well then I mean like I said as I was walking around New York and I walk around here and I just I can't help thinking to myself you know it ain't right it ain't right that people should be living like this is is there a government policy that you that you do recommend a positive positive policy that you think would help well I think you know now it's more sensible to recommend trying to manage the problem trying to reduce it than trying some dramatic strategy that's going to end homelessness there have been a lot there's been a lot of talk of ending homelessness over the past 10 15 years meeting mostly providing to permanent housing benefits to anyone who's homeless I don't think that that's a logical solution to the entire homeless population for some people you know people with chronic mental health mental illness who have no system of family support yes we've got to provide them for we've got to accept the fact that we're just gonna have to care for them for the rest of their lives for a lot of the homeless population you know if they had just sort of lost their job if it's just a temporary state I don't think we need to be giving them you know a permanent housing benefit but we do need to figure out some way in which you know to bring the rent down um we have a desperate shortage of lower housing certainly in York New York and also in San Francisco LA and we're going you know these problems like serious mental illness which is not the problem for all the homeless but the hardest cases that is also something that we need to do something about so they don't make their homes on the streets but actually you know make their homes in places where we can actually help them why why is it these essentially left-wing cities have such expensive real estate as is just because they're such as well places to live or is it the way they control the rents well housing regulation has been a big driver of homelessness if we didn't regulate away the SROs they a lot of the homeless would have a places they a private landlord contend to their housing needs as opposed to the government the government is always playing catch-up with the affordable housing game because if you regulate housing of the the reach of low-income populations well then it's going to be more expensive for you on the other end to use taxpayer funds try to build a housing for those populations clearly the you know that in the in the old days when we had this Skid Row neighborhoods the private sector actually didn't you know sort of okay job at providing housing for many of these populations and it's very hard to say that government is doing a better job in the private sector did now one issue we have is we have a lot of government subsidized housing we have the enormous NYCHA u units the projects in New York City can't miss them um there's a that as that is that is an asset that is you know possibly underutilized in terms of what it could do for the homeless population there are a lot of units people that units that are over housed people who have more rooms and they actually need and think well at the same time you know we have 60,000 homeless people so we have a lot of affordable housing we're not gonna make enough the best use of it the most efficient use day what about I mean an individual a church you know people want to go out and now you know work in soup kitchens and feed the homeless but at the same time I know that a lot of guys are running games on the street I mean I've worked with I work with the police who've shown me videos of people sitting in wheelchairs and then at the end of the day packing up their wheelchair and walking away after they've you know gotten a lot of money from begging it nobody wants to incentivize people to be homeless but is there anything that individuals can do to help people that would actually help people well you know I don't want people I want people to be compassionate I think anybody who is in favor of you know civil society doing as much as it can for these pressing needs you want to encourage people to help them out and there are you know worthy nonprofits you can find a good non-profit with a long record of success then you know it's a it's good to attach yourself to them support them in any way you can because these are these are groups who are trying to work on long term solutions of this problem dealing with you know substance abuse treatment mental illness treatment job training um you know if you feel the need to give somebody you know to give some money to a panhandlers and I don't want to say you know you should struggle up your heart and never do that but you know that's net there is a sense in which that does make it easier for that person to stay on the treat we're we're not going to on the street we're not gonna be able to help them and it's certainly not going to lead towards any sort of long-term solution to the problem well then let me take it from that angle if I wanted to be an activist of some sort what would what should I be saying to the city of LA or what should I be saying to the city of New York if I'm if I'm holding meetings if I'm organizing if I'm giving money to something where should that go I mean way there there should be it seems to me that there should there ought to be a path forward toward eliminating essentially this kind of the kind of massiveness of this problem I mean I remember in the in the 80s walking out to go to work early in the morning and and they were homeless people were lined up along the Morgan Library heating ducts to stay warm they were just sleeping a head to toe along the heating ducts Kito's on a tree you notice the way sleeping in a chain and and I just thought like you know does it have to be that way does that really is there is that a necessity or is there something that people activists should be doing to stop it well I think you know we could you separate the problem and you have to make a decision about which parts of the problem that you really feel like you need to address I mean one big driver of the problem is single-parent families most of the family most of the homeless population in New York City family with children mostly headed by single parent families that's a really tough nut to crack hard to know what government should be doing but something like you know the mentally ill we made a lot of mistakes over the years we can point to specific places in which this isn't it or made that cent make things worse and worse and worse so yes we need to provide them with housing we need to get them into treatment on people who are resistant to treatment we need to be talking about some perhaps an involuntary atlanna temporary basis way of treating them um and so that at least makes the problem as I say more manageable and you know we know that we're doing more for the the hardest cases as opposed to you know providing everybody wants housing everybody was affordable housing you know but some people really do need it more than others hmm so my last question I mean if you could basically snap your fingers and there would be one policy the changed that it would help this this problem what would it be I would I would focus on the mental illness related homelessness and I would focus on connecting the seriously mentally ill with high quality providers who not only can give them housing but provide them with case management and treatment to ensure that they will not be on the streets potentially threatening people potentially putting pushing people in front of oncoming Subway's yeah um but caring for them in a way that it you know a a civilized society with you instead of being you know very I mean it's it's great you know we think of ourselves as very tolerant he's very compassionate as opposed to you know former times but people from the 19th century if they would come to cities these days and look at these you know people living in squalor they would have a lot of questions about how truly compassionate our society ya know I that is exactly what struck me I know I said that was the last question but this one I had we asked one last thing we did to go back again to the the actual government housing that is being used you you feel that you seem to feel that a private solution that that something like a SRO hotels Bowery neighborhood that's not a good neighborhood but at least there's people to live that was actually a better solution than the one then government shelters did I get that right well I in government shelters these days in New York City the conditions in many cases are truly appalling yeah and we are spending far more on these facilities I can tell you I mean I recently in 1980 you could have gotten a night stay in a Bowery Hotel for three bucks the time it's about ten dollars now you can Panhandle that no problem you know it wasn't much yeah it wasn't you know high-class but it was the modicum of privacy it was a place to stay we're spending a lot more than that these days in many cases you know the results are not that great so the private sector system and we had a variety of you know private sector housing options there weren't just SRO the rooming houses forming out depending on which city and which time you're talking about so there was this kind of flexibility in the private month at the private market didn't have sometimes the conditions were not optimal but they were cheap yeah I mean for many people I think that was a better solution then than the one that government has been the go the solution that government has officially committed itself to since the 1980s but it really keeps falling way short of delivering on so you reach a point where it's like well maybe this is you know government is reaching a little bit too far yeah yeah Steven I thank you very much for coming on of the Manhattan Institute really interesting it's just a mind-boggling problem and it really I want to hear more about it and learn more about it because I feel like there's got to be some way forward that there is not just having people living on tents on the street they're really interesting talking to I appreciate your coming on thank you much for having me it's a pleasure thanks a lot all right Steve an ID of the Manhattan still be talking more about homelessness because I expect to solve this problem by the time I go off the air which is probably next Tuesday uh-huh all right sexual follies you know I started this program with this Justin Trudeau telling people how to talk and I you know it judgmentalism is one of to me one of the most offensive things that is coming out sometimes from the right always from the left you know I've said this many times that if you open the gospel and every sentence had been removed except Jesus saying judge not lest ye be judged you could deduce the crucifixion you could look at that say oh they're gonna kill that guy you know that's nobody gets away with that because this is the one thing we all love to do and Christians you know a lot of Christians just hate that command more than any other they want to tell you which movies to watch they want to tell you how to have sex which words you can use and be a good Christian and of course the left is just constantly constantly policing everything we think and say and do and and yet on the other side of this on the other side of this as Christians are always fast to point out because they want to get back to telling people what to do and the other side of this is the fact that of course you have a higher likelihood of living a good life if you do certain things and don't do other things a life that is moral like that lives into the self that you were supposed to be when God made you and and so you know what do you do how do you how do you communicate that to people if you feel you know something that they don't know and I would say the difference that it's the difference between purity and Puritanism the difference between purity and Puritanism is in one you are focusing on yourself and fixing yourself taking the plank out of your own eye and Puritanism you are incredibly busy telling other people about the mote in their eye I just want to end with this cut that I found on The Daily wire that just really really moved me a woman named Brittany de la mora who was a porn star and she came to God and suddenly it occurred to her that she was not this was not making her feel good about herself this was not the way she wanted to live and she got into a relationship with a pastor she decided to become sexually chaste and outside of marriage and she's lived this life and listened to the way she talks about this purity really is an internal thing so the reality is is like you can't just have an impure heart with wrong motives yep sure person because it's not it's not the abstinence of sex that makes you pure it's you know the relationship and the right standard that you have with God that makes you pure I think I think that that is a brilliant statement and you know it's the thing is because she's thinking about herself she's making herself into a living example a living testimony of the gospel instead of coming out and telling you what you should do and it's your fault she's not blaming the porn industry she's not blaming all the people who I'm sure abused her and used her in horrible ways and yet she's not thinking about that she's thinking about herself and that means that she's gonna have a better life and get closer to the person God made her to be and and that is the way of changing that is not just the way of changing the moment it also is the way of changing the future in a level-two chaotic system tomorrow the mailbag go on daily wire.com
