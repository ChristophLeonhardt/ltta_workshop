1
00:00:01,798 --> 00:00:02,531
TRUMP IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO

2
00:00:02,532 --> 00:00:02,965
FIGHT AND WIN.

3
00:00:02,966 --> 00:00:04,299
>> THE PRESIDENT IS EXPECTED TO

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,269
ANNOUNCE HIS SUPREME COURT PICK

5
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:13,942
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

6
00:00:13,943 --> 00:00:16,878
IS EN ROUTE TO NORTH KOREA TO

7
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,512
PROVE THE ROGUE REGIME IS

8
00:00:17,513 --> 00:00:23,285
COMMITTED TO DENUCLEARIZATION.

9
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:28,123
WHAT CAN WE EXPECT?

10
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:28,790
ONE OF OUR FAVORITES, NORTH

11
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:31,960
KOREA TAKES OVER THE WORLD,

12
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:39,434
GORDON CHANG, THANK YOU FOR

13
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:41,236
STAND SO FAR?

14
00:00:41,237 --> 00:00:42,704
MIKE POMPEO'S THIRD TRIP TO

15
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:43,438
NORTH KOREA ON THE HEELS OF THE

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,173
SATELLITE IMAGES WE HAVE SEEN.

17
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:55,984
UP THEIR NUCLEAR FACILITIES?

18
00:00:55,985 --> 00:00:56,718
>> THIS IS A MAKE OR BREAK TRIP

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:57,452
FOR TRUMP ADMINISTRATION POLICY.

20
00:00:57,453 --> 00:00:58,987
THE TRUMP POLICY IS BASED ON THE

21
00:00:58,988 --> 00:01:01,223
ASSUMPTION KIM JONG UN MADE A

22
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:01,957
DECISION TO GIVE UP HIS WEAPONS

23
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:06,595
BUT WE HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OVER

24
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:07,329
THE LAST WEEK THAT SHOWS NORTH

25
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:11,266
KOREA RACING AHEAD NOT ONLY ON

26
00:01:12,635 --> 00:01:13,935
MISSILES SO I THINK IT IS

27
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:17,239
IMPORTANT THAT WE GET A FIRM

28
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,610
COMMITMENT FROM THEM TO GIVE UP

29
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,244
THEIR NUKES AND MISSILES,

30
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:24,546
DISMANTLE THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE

31
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:25,714
AND PERMIT INSPECTIONS.

32
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:32,254
A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE

33
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:32,988
ADMINISTRATION IS COMING DOWN ON

34
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:33,388
ITS DEMANDS.

35
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:34,122
DON'T KNOW THAT IS TRUE BUT WE

36
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:35,390
WILL GET A GOOD INDICATION WHEN

37
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:41,163
THIS TRIP IS OVER SO IT IS NOW

38
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:44,800
OR NEVER FOR THE ADMINISTRATION.

39
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:45,534
HEATHER: HE SENT A TWEET SAYING

40
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:50,238
MANY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH

41
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:50,639
NORTH KOREA.

42
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,139
IT IS GOING WELL.

43
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:51,773
IN THE MEANTIME NO ROCKET

44
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:55,610
LAUNCHES OR NUCLEAR TESTING IN

45
00:01:56,779 --> 00:02:01,350
INCLUDES THE FAKE NEWS IS

46
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:01,750
COMPLAINING.

47
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:02,484
IF NOT FOR ME WE WOULD NOW BE AT

48
00:02:06,723 --> 00:02:07,389
>> I DON'T THINK THERE IS A

49
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,123
FACTUAL BASIS FOR THE CLAIM WE

50
00:02:08,124 --> 00:02:14,696
WOULD BE AT WAR WERE IT NOT FOR

51
00:02:14,697 --> 00:02:14,963
HIM.

52
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:15,564
WITH REGARD TO WHETHER

53
00:02:15,565 --> 00:02:16,298
NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING WELL OR

54
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:24,306
NOT WE WILL KNOW BY THE END OF

55
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:26,408
NORTH KOREANS BECAUSE THEY ARE

56
00:02:26,409 --> 00:02:27,142
SCHEDULED FOR A DAY AND A HALF,

57
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:28,977
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY LOCAL TIME.

58
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:29,711
I THINK IN SOME SENSE THEY ARE

59
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:32,514
GOING WELL BUT THERE IS CONCERN

60
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:39,588
THEY WOULDN'T BE LEAKING IF THEY

61
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:40,288
THOUGHT THINGS WERE GOING THE

62
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:43,658
WAY THEY WANTED SO THERE'S A LOT

63
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:45,160
AT STAKE AND I THINK DONALD

64
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:47,829
TRUMP HAS AN OBLIGATION TO TALK

65
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:53,735
INTELLIGENCE IS REAL AND NOT

66
00:02:53,736 --> 00:03:01,209
JUST FROM LEAKS BUT FROM

67
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:01,943
OBSERVATION OF SATELLITE IMAGERY

68
00:03:01,944 --> 00:03:02,511
BY PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE

69
00:03:02,512 --> 00:03:03,111
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

70
00:03:03,112 --> 00:03:03,745
THEY'LL POINT IN THE SAME

71
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:06,948
DIRECTION, NORTH KOREA IS RACING

72
00:03:06,949 --> 00:03:07,649
AHEAD AND THAT IS TROUBLESOME.

73
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,118
>> IS IT A NEGOTIATION TYPE

74
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:19,528
>> SURE AND IT COULD BE A

75
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:20,195
NEGOTIATION TACTIC THAT THE

76
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:21,163
NORTH KOREANS ARE RACING AHEAD

77
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,998
ON THEIR PROGRAM TO GET IS GOOD

78
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:25,867
A DEAL AS POSSIBLE FROM THE

79
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:31,406
ADMINISTRATION BUT THIS

80
00:03:31,407 --> 00:03:32,140
PARTICULAR TIME THERE IS CONCERN

81
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,874
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING

82
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,444
TO BACK DOWN AND PART OF IT IS

83
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,145
BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF AT

84
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:40,982
THE END OF JUNE TALKED ABOUT

85
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:41,716
NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS WITH NORTH

86
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:42,451
KOREA IS LIKE COOKING TURKEYS,

87
00:03:42,452 --> 00:03:52,727
IT IS DONE BETTER OVER A LONG

88
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:54,396
ADMINISTRATION SAID IT WOULDN'T

89
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:55,130
DO AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE

90
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:55,864
ADMINISTRATION TO STICK TO ITS

91
00:03:55,865 --> 00:00:00,000
OWN POSITIONS.
