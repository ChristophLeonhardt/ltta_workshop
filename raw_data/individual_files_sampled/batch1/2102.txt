it's kind of amazing how we've all been living under the delusion that the more successful people in business are people was reported are working 24/7 when did we start devaluing sleep where did that macho mentality about sleep come from in ancient Greece and ancient Rome in ancient Egypt it was revered there were special sleep temples where people would go to incubate their dreams and get guidance about their lives and their health so in my history chapter attracted back to the first Industrial Revolution when we started thinking that we could treat human beings like machines and therefore the goal was to minimize downtime so it's taking a while to unravel all that to unravel the fact that so many executives for years have bragged about how little sleep they need and get and in fact I've been wearing their sleep deprivation like a badge of honor now that's changing but when I say not now I literally mean now it's kind of over the last year so that we have CEOs like Satya Nadella from Microsoft who actually told Business Insider for the first time that he he needs eight hours sleep to be an effective leader probably a CEO a few years back even if he needed and God eight hours would not have admitted it because the culture was so much about celebrating and sleep deprivation as a sign of commitment and dedication to what you are doing
