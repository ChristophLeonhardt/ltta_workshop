1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,536
DIDN’T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO MUCH MORE THAN TRY TO SAY --WELL

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:04,237
MUCH MORE THAN TRY TO SAY --WELL OF COURSE THEY’RE AGAINST ME

3
00:00:04,238 --> 00:00:04,938
OF COURSE THEY’RE AGAINST ME BECAUSE I’VE TAKEN POSITIONS

4
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,640
BECAUSE I’VE TAKEN POSITIONS AGAINST THEM.

5
00:00:06,641 --> 00:00:07,808
AGAINST THEM. >> ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,610
>> ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID TO ME WHEN WE TALKED A

7
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,244
YOU SAID TO ME WHEN WE TALKED A YEAR AGO.

8
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:12,946
YEAR AGO. YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT BASICALLY

9
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,714
YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT BASICALLY THE PROSPECT OF MANAGING THIS

10
00:00:14,749 --> 00:00:15,115
THE PROSPECT OF MANAGING THIS PRESIDENT.

11
00:00:15,116 --> 00:00:16,850
PRESIDENT. YOU GUYS, DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE

12
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:18,351
YOU GUYS, DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE THIS CLIP THAT WE CAN PLAY?

13
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,185
THIS CLIP THAT WE CAN PLAY? ALL RIGHT.

14
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,553
ALL RIGHT. ROLL IT.

15
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,155
ROLL IT. >> THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM HAVE TO

16
00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:25,325
>> THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM HAVE TO BE OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE

17
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,559
BE OUR FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST HIM DOING SOMETHING THAT

18
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,060
AGAINST HIM DOING SOMETHING THAT COULD HAVE SERIOUS

19
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,964
COULD HAVE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS.

20
00:00:30,965 --> 00:00:32,732
REPERCUSSIONS. >> PLACING A LOT OF HOPE FOR

00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:34,368
>> PLACING A LOT OF HOPE FOR COUNTRY THE WISDOM OF THE PEOPLE

22
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,168
COUNTRY THE WISDOM OF THE PEOPLE WHO SURROUND HIM.

23
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,903
WHO SURROUND HIM. >> WELL, IT’S NOT -- WE DON’T

24
00:00:36,938 --> 00:00:38,171
>> WELL, IT’S NOT -- WE DON’T HAVE MUCH ELSE TO PLACE IT ON

25
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:39,105
HAVE MUCH ELSE TO PLACE IT ON RIGHT NOW.

26
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,242
RIGHT NOW. HE IS SOMEBODY WHO DOESN’T

27
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,778
HE IS SOMEBODY WHO DOESN’T LISTEN AND PURSUES HIS OWN

28
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:47,814
LISTEN AND PURSUES HIS OWN INTERESTS AS HE PERCEIVES THEM

29
00:00:47,849 --> 00:00:51,685
INTERESTS AS HE PERCEIVES THEM AND IS VERY EMOTIONALLY

30
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:51,985
AND IS VERY EMOTIONALLY REACTIVE.

31
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,488
REACTIVE. SO ON THE SMALL STUFF, YOU KNOW,

32
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,357
SO ON THE SMALL STUFF, YOU KNOW, THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP

33
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:56,657
THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STOP HIM.

34
00:00:56,658 --> 00:01:00,360
HIM. THEY MAY NEED TO HOLD THEIR FIRE

35
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:01,761
THEY MAY NEED TO HOLD THEIR FIRE TILL SOMETHING IS SERIOUS ENOUGH

36
00:01:01,763 --> 00:01:02,596
TILL SOMETHING IS SERIOUS ENOUGH TO INTERVENE.

37
00:01:02,597 --> 00:01:03,897
TO INTERVENE. >> SO YOU SAID THAT HERE A YEAR

38
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:05,365
>> SO YOU SAID THAT HERE A YEAR AGO, TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE AROUND

OFFICE IN ORDER TO STOP TRUMP DOING WHAT HE WANTS.

55
00:01:34,296 --> 00:01:35,830
DOING WHAT HE WANTS. YOU PREDICTED IT, TALKED ABOUT

56
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,932
YOU PREDICTED IT, TALKED ABOUT IT A YEAR AGO, BUT IS THAT

57
00:01:37,966 --> 00:01:39,400
IT A YEAR AGO, BUT IS THAT DYNAMIC COMFORTING?

58
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:40,501
DYNAMIC COMFORTING? IT IS TERRIFYING?

59
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:41,235
IT IS TERRIFYING? IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?

60
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:43,838
IS IT SOMETHING ELSE? >> WELL, IT’S HORRIFYING ON SO

61
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,506
>> WELL, IT’S HORRIFYING ON SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS, AND I

62
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,441
MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS, AND I THINK THAT ANYONE WHOSE WORKED

63
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:50,244
THINK THAT ANYONE WHOSE WORKED IN A WHITE HOUSE, WORKED IN AN

64
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,312
IN A WHITE HOUSE, WORKED IN AN ADMINISTRATION, SEEN THE

65
00:01:51,346 --> 00:01:52,847
ADMINISTRATION, SEEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE DECISIONS THAT

66
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:56,284
COMPLEXITY OF THE DECISIONS THAT END UP ON THE PRESIDENT’S DESK

67
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:58,152
END UP ON THE PRESIDENT’S DESK HAS TO BE INCREDIBLY WORRIED,

68
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:01,155
HAS TO BE INCREDIBLY WORRIED, NUMBER ONE, THAT IF PEOPLE

69
00:02:01,156 --> 00:02:03,057
NUMBER ONE, THAT IF PEOPLE AROUND HIM WHOM HE HAS APPOINTED

70
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:07,995
AROUND HIM WHOM HE HAS APPOINTED ARE TRYING TO SAVE THE COUNTRY

71
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,431
ARE TRYING TO SAVE THE COUNTRY FROM POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS

72
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,867
FROM POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS DECISIONS HE MIGHT MAKE, THAT’S

73
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,602
DECISIONS HE MIGHT MAKE, THAT’S DEEPLY TROUBLING.

74
00:02:14,636 --> 00:02:18,172
DEEPLY TROUBLING. BUT IT’S ALSO BOTHERSOME TO SEE

75
00:02:18,206 --> 00:02:21,976
BUT IT’S ALSO BOTHERSOME TO SEE THESE ANONYMOUS SOURCES SAYING

76
00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:23,244
THESE ANONYMOUS SOURCES SAYING THIS BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE

77
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:24,845
THIS BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE DILEMMA THEY THINK THEY FACE.

78
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:26,781
DILEMMA THEY THINK THEY FACE. THEY THINK THAT IF THEY’RE NOT

79
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:28,349
THEY THINK THAT IF THEY’RE NOT THERE, YOU KNOW, AFTER THEM, THE

80
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,286
THERE, YOU KNOW, AFTER THEM, THE DELUGE, THERE WILL BE A TOTAL

81
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:33,754
DELUGE, THERE WILL BE A TOTAL CATASTROPHE, BUT I THINK AT SOME

82
00:02:33,756 --> 00:02:35,390
CATASTROPHE, BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT THEY OWE IT TO THE COUNTRY

83
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:39,394
POINT THEY OWE IT TO THE COUNTRY AND THEY OWE IT TO PEOPLE WHO

84
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:40,629
AND THEY OWE IT TO PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE I

85
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:43,898
SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE I DON’T THINK THAT THOSE PEOPLE

86
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:48,069
DON’T THINK THAT THOSE PEOPLE REALLY FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT IS

87
00:02:48,103 --> 00:02:50,004
REALLY FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT IS POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE UNDER THIS

88
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:50,404
POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE UNDER THIS PRESIDENCY.

89
00:02:50,406 --> 00:02:52,273
PRESIDENCY. WHAT I WORRY ABOUT, RACHEL, IS

90
00:02:52,275 --> 00:02:54,675
WHAT I WORRY ABOUT, RACHEL, IS THAT AFTER THIS ELECTION THIS

91
00:02:54,677 --> 00:02:55,910
THAT AFTER THIS ELECTION THIS PRESIDENT’S GOING TO WHOLESALE

92
00:02:55,912 --> 00:02:56,511
PRESIDENT’S GOING TO WHOLESALE FIRE PEOPLE.

93
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:57,946
FIRE PEOPLE. THAT’S MY PREDICTION FOR

94
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,914
THAT’S MY PREDICTION FOR TONIGHT, LIKE MY PREDICTION FROM

95
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,783
TONIGHT, LIKE MY PREDICTION FROM LAST YEAR, AND IF WE DON’T HAVE

96
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:04,419
LAST YEAR, AND IF WE DON’T HAVE ONE OR BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS

97
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:07,422
ONE OR BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS IN PLACE, HE WILL BE EVEN MORE

98
00:03:07,423 --> 00:03:09,024
IN PLACE, HE WILL BE EVEN MORE UNCONTROLLABLE AND

99
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:09,458
UNCONTROLLABLE AND UNACCOUNTABLE.

100
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:10,925
UNACCOUNTABLE. HE WILL FIRE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE

101
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,325
HE WILL FIRE PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

102
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:13,461
HOUSE. HE WILL FIRE PEOPLE IN HIS

103
00:03:13,496 --> 00:03:15,730
HE WILL FIRE PEOPLE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION WHO HE THINKS ARE

104
00:03:15,765 --> 00:03:18,933
ADMINISTRATION WHO HE THINKS ARE CROSSING HIM, QUESTIONING HIM,

105
00:03:18,935 --> 00:03:19,868
CROSSING HIM, QUESTIONING HIM, UNDERMINING HIM.

106
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:21,536
UNDERMINING HIM. AND I THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE

107
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,773
AND I THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE HOURS I SPENT IN THE SITUATION

108
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:25,640
HOURS I SPENT IN THE SITUATION ROOM WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA.

109
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:27,408
ROOM WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA. AND WE HAD VIGOROUS

110
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,010
AND WE HAD VIGOROUS DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF

111
00:03:29,012 --> 00:03:32,413
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ISSUES, BUT I NEVER, EVER, EVER

112
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:33,749
ISSUES, BUT I NEVER, EVER, EVER DOUBTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS

113
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:35,150
DOUBTED THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS MAKING THE BEST DECISION HE

114
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:37,219
MAKING THE BEST DECISION HE COULD BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE

115
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:38,754
COULD BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE AS WE WERE REQUIRED TO

116
00:03:38,788 --> 00:03:39,922
EVIDENCE AS WE WERE REQUIRED TO PRESENT IT TO HIM.

117
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,857
PRESENT IT TO HIM. HE DIDN’T SAY TO US, WELL,

118
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,825
HE DIDN’T SAY TO US, WELL, HERE’S WHAT I BELIEVE, HERE’S

119
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:44,959
HERE’S WHAT I BELIEVE, HERE’S WHAT MY GUT TELLS ME.

120
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:45,861
WHAT MY GUT TELLS ME. HE SAYS WHAT’S THE EVIDENCE?

121
00:03:45,895 --> 00:03:46,795
HE SAYS WHAT’S THE EVIDENCE? WHAT ARE THE FACTS?

122
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,630
WHAT ARE THE FACTS? WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FROM,

123
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:50,365
WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FROM, YOU KNOW, PATH A TO PATH Z.

124
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:54,236
YOU KNOW, PATH A TO PATH Z. THAT’S NOT HAPPENING IN THIS

125
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,871
THAT’S NOT HAPPENING IN THIS WHITE HOUSE, AND SO THE

126
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:57,940
WHITE HOUSE, AND SO THE PRESIDENT IS CLOSE TO BEING

127
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,373
PRESIDENT IS CLOSE TO BEING UNCONTROLLABLE.

128
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:00,275
UNCONTROLLABLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL IN THERE

129
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,978
THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL IN THERE WHO BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION ARE

130
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:04,680
WHO BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION ARE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO PREVENT

131
00:04:04,681 --> 00:04:06,348
TRYING TO HOLD ON TO PREVENT EVEN WORSE THINGS FROM

132
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:07,649
EVEN WORSE THINGS FROM HAPPENING, AND AT SOME POINT THE

133
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,184
HAPPENING, AND AT SOME POINT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS TO SAY,

134
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:12,554
AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS TO SAY, NUMBER ONE, I MAY DISAGREE WITH

135
00:04:12,555 --> 00:04:15,690
NUMBER ONE, I MAY DISAGREE WITH DEMOCRATS, I MAY DISAGREE WITH

136
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:16,992
DEMOCRATS, I MAY DISAGREE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THIS

137
00:04:16,993 --> 00:04:18,193
THE DIRECTION OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, BUT ONE THING I

138
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,594
ADMINISTRATION, BUT ONE THING I BELIEVE IN IS WE HAVE TO HAVE

139
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:20,696
BELIEVE IN IS WE HAVE TO HAVE CHECKS AND BALANCES.

140
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:22,765
CHECKS AND BALANCES. THAT’S WHY WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR

141
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,099
THAT’S WHY WE HAVE TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS IN NOVEMBER.

142
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:26,201
DEMOCRATS IN NOVEMBER. >> THE OTHER UNSETTLING

143
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:27,703
>> THE OTHER UNSETTLING ADMISSION OR ASSERTION IN THAT

144
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:29,805
ADMISSION OR ASSERTION IN THAT OP-ED WAS THAT THE CABINET HAS

145
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,573
OP-ED WAS THAT THE CABINET HAS ALREADY DISCUSSED POTENTIALLY

146
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:34,210
ALREADY DISCUSSED POTENTIALLY TRYING TO REMOVE PRESIDENT TRUMP

147
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,177
TRYING TO REMOVE PRESIDENT TRUMP BY THE 25th AMENDMENT AS

148
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:36,679
BY THE 25th AMENDMENT AS ESSENTIALLY BEING UNFIT,

149
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,815
ESSENTIALLY BEING UNFIT, INCAPABLE OF HOLDING THE JOB.

150
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,117
INCAPABLE OF HOLDING THE JOB. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ASSERTION

151
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:43,385
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ASSERTION THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAPPENED,

152
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,987
THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAPPENED, FIRST OF ALL, AND DO YOU THINK

153
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:46,222
FIRST OF ALL, AND DO YOU THINK THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE

154
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:46,656
THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE APPROPRIATE?

155
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,625
APPROPRIATE? >> WELL, I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE

156
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:49,959
>> WELL, I HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.

157
00:04:49,993 --> 00:04:50,693
OF THAT. IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THERE

158
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:53,028
IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THERE WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN A LEAK IF

159
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,230
WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN A LEAK IF SUCH A FORMAL DISCUSSION HAD

160
00:04:55,232 --> 00:04:56,932
SUCH A FORMAL DISCUSSION HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE, BUT I DO

161
00:04:56,934 --> 00:05:00,836
BEEN TAKING PLACE, BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY PRIVATE

162
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,937
THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS AMONG PEOPLE IN THE

163
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,672
DISCUSSIONS AMONG PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE, IN THE

164
00:05:03,707 --> 00:05:04,507
