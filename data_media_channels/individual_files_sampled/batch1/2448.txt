if you could give Trump one piece of advice first first day in office what would it be go visit the Lincoln Memorial go read the Constitution go read the Bill of Rights go visit the African history museum get some sense of what this job is you change jobs a lot from where you were show people that you care about these things and I think that would be the most important thing you do not particularly as an economist I would say get a personal fact checker to stay up late into the night with you that person should be there in the in your living room so when you next time you tweet run it by the fact first his first day in office don't tweet I picked from more of a policy standpoint one of the things I would love to see him do is take the team of rivals idea seriously and figure out who are the people who most fundamentally disagree with him and how can he get their voices in the room please remember that human goodness is the biggest success you can achieve in the world and serving others just manipulate instrumentalizing I don't know that I could give Trump advice because most people that you give advice to are capable of taking advice the thing that worries me most but the advice I would want Trump to take would be I mean he now has a cabinet with appointees some of whom were very good I would want Trump to listen to them and he's 70 years old I don't think he's changing
