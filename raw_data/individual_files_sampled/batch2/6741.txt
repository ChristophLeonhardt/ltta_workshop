stormy Daniels who is the adult porn actress and filmmaker who is alleged to have had a sexual affair with Donald Trump and then it was alleged that she was paid $130,000 in hush money back in appeared on Jimmy Kimmel show last night now the appearance coincided with the State of the Union address and a lot of people were wondering whether or not she was going to speak up about all of these reports regarding her relationship with Donald Trump back in the early 2000s and there was an interesting exchange now before the State of the Union there was a statement released and allegedly signed by stormy Daniels indicating that you know she completely denied any type of relationship with him and denied that there was ever any hush money involved let me read that statement to you right now graphic 50 the fact of the matter is that each party to this alleged affair denied its existence in 2006 2011 2016 2017 and now again in 2018 I am NOT denying the affair because I was paid hush money as has been reported in overseas owned tabloids I am denying this affair because it never happened and then she allegedly signed that statement well Kimmel noticed something about that signature and I wish I could show you the original video but because of copyright issues we are not able to so we created we recreated the exchange between Kimmel and stormy Daniels take a look what fascinates me the signature on the original statement does not seem to match the signature here and I have gone back through my library of photographs of you to compare headshots that you have signed and they don't seem to match anything except for the original statement so I guess my question is did you sign the statement that was released today I don't know did I wait a minute it doesn't look like my signature does it so wait you're saying that perhaps this letter was written and released without your approval all right so do you know where it came from to have any idea I don't know where it came from came from the internet I also worked for the FBI and I'm a man according to the Internet today you have to do a full examination so I love your recreations I think we should just do the whole show on that so she doesn't deny that that that she didn't write that statement and she doesn't really even deny that she had that affair with him like she can't say much because apparently she signed something that's preventing her from really speaking out but InTouch had interviewed her back in 2011 and she gave pretty graphic details about her sexual affair with Donald Trump yeah so that was before she had gotten 130 thousand dollars allegedly yeah and before she had signed a statement saying that she can't talk about it allegedly so if you guys remember when her that original statement from stormy Daniels came out I read some of the lines and said this is a stormy Daniels this sounds exactly like the Trump team because it had a bunch of Trump isms in there I forget exactly what they were but it was like I tremendously denied this accusation Bigley I'm like she didn't write bad okay and they and she she didn't come out with a statement Trump's lawyer came out with a statement saying believe me this is what she wrote and I was like no I don't believe you your Trump's lawyer and that sounds like Trump yeah and so now with her obvious non-denial they're like oh yeah I guess it you know is that my signature yeah it's not she never wrote it so again for me him having an affair I don't care like if it's a consensual situation I don't care it's not a big deal for me what was interesting was the hush money and also how he's he's a target-rich environment what don't we know about like there are things out there that we don't even know about yet like what else has he paid for in you know hush money I don't know and I feel like when I say he's a target written I'm worried about bribes I'm worried about extortion I'm worried about you know who has what kind of dirt on the President of the United States and how it could compromise you know the way that he behaves and the policies that he pushes for it's just and what he's willing to do or trade to make sure that those stories don't get out so that's a relevant issue and look I and Ben is right when he says on the show that hypocrisy is a little overrated everybody talks about hypocrisy but in this case when the evangelical leaders came out and said that's alright we're giving Trump a mulligan on this one hey and I'm gonna get to the most relevant part here but thank you about all the different parts if Obama has slept with a porn star cheated on his wife do you think he gets a mulligan if there were very chance very legitimate stories saying that he paid her hush money so that the American people didn't find out right before the election you think that evangelical leaders and Trump voters would have given Obama a mulligan right and then finally the important part using what now the allegations are that he used campaign money to you to pay her that's illegal and oh my god they would have shredded Obama it would have been the biggest scandal of his presidency by an order of magnitude a hundred times bigger than whatever nonsense scandals they invented about Obama and now it's barely a story for for Trump so she never wrote that letter god bless Kimmel for not proving that with it with it without a shadow of a doubt right and and and she gave the 2011 interview you could see it you can see exactly what her and Trump actually did what you just watched was one of the videos that we do today but we actually do a whole two-hour show every single day it's a podcast you could watch it a video or listen to it as audio you can download it you can stream it you can get it completely ad-free if you
