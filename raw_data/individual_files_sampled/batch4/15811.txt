as the NYPD and the city of New York alongside the Department of Justice covered up the murder of a New York City police officer for over 45 years well they just might have and there's a group now looking into it back in April of 1972 New York City police officer well then called patrolman Philip Cardillo was shot and killed in Harlem at the Nation of Islam's mosque number 7 his murder till this day over 45 years later is still unsolved well now Judicial Watch Judicial Watch have become like the white knights like the Knights Templar they ride in on these white horses and they uncover all of this stuff typically progressives are trying to bury well now they're suing the New York City Police Department the city of New York and the Department of Justice for potentially or potentially covering up the murder of Pio Cardillo and it's a very very troubling troubling case and I go far more in-depth on this topic on my new show off the cuff Declassified the full hour-long show that also launched today but let's get into the details of this case so back in April of 1972 I believe that it was April 14th 1972 in the morning about 11:40 a.m. 1141 a.m. a 911 received by somebody claiming to be a detective Thomas of the 28th precinct NYPD's 28th precinct now there was a detective Thomas working at the 28th precinct at the time but he never made that phone call well this day we don't know who made that phone call that phone call directed police officers to an address on one hundred and sixteenth Street in Harlem which turned out to be the Nation of Islam's mosque number seven yes who was in the mosque that day Louis Farrakhan his office was on the third floor the police officers were directed to the second floor and the second floor held classrooms and things of that nature now that caller never told the 9-1-1 dispatcher that it was a Nation of Islam and the nine woman dispatcher didn't know that back then they didn't have the computer systems we have today we're not only be addressed with the business corresponding with the address or the resident pop up on a computer screaming screen instantaneously this was 1972 communications were still pretty crude and computer communications are virtually non-existent though police officer card ello and his partner Vito navara show up there and they get there and something peculiar is going on the doors to the mosque the steel doors which are typically locked and the guard that are typically outside the mosque security well they're not there he'll Cardillo pia navarro getting the building let's call him patrolman they were called patrolmen back then they get into the building where they're met with six men met by six men in the reception area pardillo engages those men in conversation navarro goes upstairs he's met by just under a dozen more he's pushed down the stairs by this point nine other police officers show up and struggle ensues a struggle ensues and all but three of the police officers are pushed outside of the mosque steel door slammed and locked behind them meaning that Pele Cardillo and two other cops are left in the building and just around 11:45 a.m. a few minutes later maybe three minutes after the initial call I mean this response was very quick shots fired comes over the radio cops forced their way back into the mosque they find police officer Cardillo laying on the floor in a pool of blood a bullet gun through his right side exited his left he dies in a hospital 6 days later but what happened next was really the travesty the murder of a patrolman Cardillo is tragic enough what happened next was even worse louis farrakhan shows up with congressman Charles Rangel of Harlem now a chief of detectives Abbey Chief of Detectives had shown up a guy named Albert Seidman by that time Seidman was told by Rangel hey look these people here are upset now outside the mosque that scene is deteriorating it's chaotic it's about to turn into a riot and Rangel tell Seidman hey I can't guarantee your personal safety you got to get out of here Seidman says are you nuts not going anywhere I've got a dead cop steve minh calls for backup to control the situation and his request is denied denied yeah a chief you understand a chief of the chief of detectives in the NYPD is a three-star there are only three people in the police department and four in the city who outrank him in the police department it would be the chief of department who wears four stars the first deputy commissioner and the police commissioner and if you want to add one more citywide it's the mayor so it had to have been the chief of department the Deputy First Deputy Commissioner the police commissioner or the mayor who denied chief seidman request for backup because no one else had the authority to do that the rest of the department hierarchy where his laterals and the rest was subordinate to him he ordered them there were only four people that could have that could have denied his request for backup and many people suspect that it came directly from Mayor John Lindsay Sophos a very liberal Democrat a guy that was a doormat for radical groups now there's an interesting tidbit in all this and that's that the FBI might have had a hand in advertently in the murder of Peale Cardillo because at the time in the 60s and 70s they were running their COINTELPRO operations for counterintelligence program and it was designed to electronically and and physically surveil and disrupt radical groups and top of that list for the black separatist groups like the new Black Panther Party the Black Liberation Army and the Nation of Islam one of the tactics they deployed was making 9-1-1 calls you send police into these organizations offices or events to disrupt that event that organization and so the question that is lingered for over 45 years because the person who purported to be detective Thomas of the 28th precinct the person who made that 9-1-1 call and called in a 1013 and understand in the New York City Police Department a 1013 is the highest alert call there is I've called that once all my time on the straight I called one once and that was when we were in a shootout and that literally means you send the cavalry you send everybody until we tell you to stop sending them because our lives are in imminent danger the cops rushed there but we never found out till this day we have no idea who made that call and a question is always lingered as to whether or not it was the FBI as one of their strategies to disrupt the Nation of Islam and then they would have done it of course not knowing that they were sending a New York City police officer to his death what if it was the FBI and they knew that we're sending the cops who Nation of Islam's mosque number seven and didn't tell the dispatcher that it was a Nation of Islam mosque which never happened and the dispatcher didn't know well that would be very very problematic and put some appeal card dillos blood on the FBI's hands now this theory is supported by the fact that FBI agents actually showed up at the offices of the detective end district attorney investigators when this wasn't an FBI case this was a state charge a state homicide a murder charge for the murder of a New York City police officer there was no federal component here so many asked why did the FBI show up and they showed up once and they never showed up again when they were asked questions about why they were there but really the blame or this botched investigation lies on the feet of the progressives who are running New York City at the time it lies to the feet of Charlie Rangel the congressman who was tremendously influential in in New York City back in those days he was influential throughout his entire career it lies at the feet of the hierarchy of the New York City Police Department it went along with the mayor's office and allowed the investigation of one of their own to be impeded we find out in an article that was Judicial Watch wrote on this in 2015 that Nation of Islam members were allowed to mop up the crime scene after all the police were pulled away the crime scene was never secured one of the first things you're taught in the Academy is you secure that crime scene we don't care if your boss wants to walk through it if they don't have a reason to walk through it you tell them no and you get a ranking supervisor or detective to tell them no if they're arguing with you preservation of the crime scene literally means the difference between the conviction and the acquittal of a murderer of a rapist of an armed robber you preserve that crime scene at all costs that wasn't done here and so I am just static that Judicial Watch is reopening this case this is one that's no been bidden I'm emotionally connected to this because I had the same last name as the guy because he was a above the murdered cop because it was a New York City police officer I patrolled many of those same streets I entered those exact same situations this is hard for me to read it's a 45 year old incident I was a little baby when this happened it's still hard to read as I read the incident narrative in front of me I had chills going down my arm because I could remember those radio calls I remembered showing up on the scene of a shot police officer and then racing to the hospital and then having an older cop I was a rookie when police officer Sean McDonald was killed I'll never forget one of the older cops in my command good guys speak to him to this day he walked out and he just shook his head he had tears in his eyes and he said cops dead and it was it was very tough this is a guy who came through the Academy with me he was in my academy class Sean McDonald and he was killed and being that close to it so when I read this incident narrative even though it's from 45 years ago and even though my recollection of pol MacDonald's murder 180 years ago he's 23 years ago now going on 24 it's like it was yesterday you never forget you still get the chills just feel sad you have to pit in your stomach oh I'm so encouraged that Judicial Watch is reopening this case because Lisa officer Carr dillos memory demands justice and quite frankly every murder victim whose murder has gone unsolved the man's justice if you like this great and really important content I want to keep bringing it to you and I've been bringing more to you with my hour-long show and I go more and this segment about the murder appeal Cardillo I go really in-depth almost a half hour into this case on off-the-cuff
