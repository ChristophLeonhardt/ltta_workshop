all these loser person and personal indulgence movies by those Hollywood executives who started the conversations by don't you hate George W Bush they failed commercially didn't they Oh huge there were over a dozen of them well I'll tell you a funny story about this this is if you want to know what Hollywood is like this is the perfect story there were over a dozen of these films they all did badly they all did poorly now you have to understand that in the economy of Hollywood almost every movie makes money eventually because they make movies money overseas they make money through DVD sales and streaming they make money through popcorn they you know they find a way to finance all these things but but obviously it's not the same money that you make with a hick while these movies were coming out one after another after another and the one that was the only one that was actually Pro our military was on HBO and it was called something like bringing I can't remember what it's called bringing chance or something about bringing the body of a dead marine home was excoriated by the critics for being jingoistic which it wasn't so these pictures came out bombed one after another and variety beaches our trade journal the show business trade journal and and the new york times were writing articles saying you know audiences just aren't interested in this scene movies about this war they just aren't interested in this war you know they just and then and then Clint Eastwood made one of the great American films American sniper which was not jingoistic at all it talked about the the difficulties of war but just showed the simple truth that Americans were the spearhead of a moral nation and these Islamists are the lowest most disgusting killers on earth and that's all it did was just show the reality of it and of course it was I think the number three box or r-rated box-office hit of all time and the New York Times and variety then we're stroking their chins going huh what a puzzlement why is it that suddenly what we thought people weren't interested in this war and they couldn't understand that we didn't want to go to the theater and watch our guys run down dishonestly because each and every time these films came out these guys would say well it's based on true story so it's valid but of course there were 200 to 250 thousand service men and women in action that's a small city some of them are gonna be bad guys you can always find a bad guys story but it wasn't representative American sniper was representative of the great hero of rape America that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
