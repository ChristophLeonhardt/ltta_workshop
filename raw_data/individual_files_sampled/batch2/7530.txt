hey everybody this is Johnny to roll it for Young Turks opposite damage for twitch hopefully you're watching every morning on YouTube TV or catching a podcast on the app and if you've been watching The Young Turks over the past few days you know that jankura and myself have had a major disagreement about one fundamental result of some of all the way until yesterday and that has to do with whether all that is going on is actually gonna result in donald trump leaving office anytime soon and by soon what I need Jake believes that it's likely to happen before the November is really ask me sue and I'll fix the typo don't worry about that and so I want to give a fair description of what jinx reasoning is at least as in terms of how I understand it and then give a few reasons why I don't believe he's actually gonna go anywhere so Jake believes that with all that Muller and the current state local prosecutors know about Donald Trump in his associates that they're probably going to put together some sort of case and not necessarily go through the normal process of prosecuting it and then taking him out the reason he's going to go soon is that they'll put together all that information show that they've got a dead to rights present it to him and he will step down to save himself or his organization or his family it's likely to happen for a couple of different reasons the first is that him being presented with this information and not doing anything about it makes rational sense if what they have is actually enough to convict him mystic lashes out at those who are against the trade or like disloyal or insulting it sound a little bit similar but also a little different and I talked about this in the Friday show Donald Trump does not play by the rules and by that I mean any rules whatsoever here I'll try to come in with my hand so it's not as noisy I apologize live videos a rough thing I don't think there's really any place where it wouldn't block or would block the noise so I'll go a little bit closer and I'll try to talk a little bit louder Donald Trump doesn't play by the rules of business he doesn't play by the rules of politics he doesn't play by the rules of you know any sort of polite society or anything like that he treats people like crap he cheats on his wife he cheats the people that he works with he reneged on deals he cheats the government out of money he breaks laws to bring in employees all of that stuff and that means that when it comes time to either present the case that Janke is talking about or pursuing an actual investigation and he is shown that he is not going to play by the rules in that either and so even if they had him dead to rights do we know for sure that he wouldn't simply lock up the people investigate him that he wouldn't do whatever it takes to save himself and his reputation and that of his family it's possible that maybe he's not actually the the full level authoritarian that we think that he is but it's also possible that that's exactly what he is and it became time for them to present that information it actually makes me think of the third prequel for Star Wars the yeah I'm gonna do better with the title of that it makes me think of the third prequel for summer Wars Revenge of the Sith when they present the information they go to arrest Palpatine and he has to actually make his move it's possible that Donald Trump will do something like that I don't know what that would look like they could simply be shutting down the investigation it could go further than that but at this point I don't know that we can really write off any possibility and the third is this if it doesn't come to putting together information and presenting him with some sort of case and saying hey it's time for you to step down if they're actually going to go through with a normal investigation that is an incredibly long slow thing as as we've seen both in terms of the investigation of Donald Trump but even look at the people that they've that they've gotten look at Paul Manafort may we've known for a long time at the pad Paul manna for had been breaking the law they knew for a long time the investigators knew that he had breakin a lot and yet it's still something like it's taken what it took a year to get those guilty pleas out of him and that's Paul Manafort a person whom there's not really any downside to investigate him they don't have to be quite as careful as they would be with the president if you're gonna come for the president if you're gonna make the case that you should that he should resign or that he should be impeached or that he should be thrown in jail you need to be so incredibly careful which means that we're not looking at a year we're looking at longer than a year and at that point maybe you drag it out until he loses reelection and then you prosecute him that's sort of my fear now none of this has anything to do with whether or not he actually broke the law obviously I think that he did both since he's been president while he was becoming president and for the years before he was president I certainly think that he broke the law but I think that we need to be very careful about our expectations the hope that we have because this battle isn't going away anytime soon and I don't want and I know that this is not what jank is trying to do at all but since he's you know set up you know justice Democrats and Wolfpack and all these organizations that are try and is there to come to win yes thank you and he's done all this stuff to try to get people to be active and do what they need to do but we need to do that and we cannot expect that in a month or six months or even two years Donald Trump isn't going to be president we still need to fight on particular issues in these primaries some of you out there watching this video need to run for office so that the Democrats in Congress will be the Democrats that we need we need to do all of that stuff and we can't allow ourselves to think that that is going to be solved for us either by Muller or some prosecutor in New York or anything like that so my fingers are crossed in this bet that I have with jank that he wins the bet I want him to win that bet there will be no happier moment in my life perhaps financially than when I hand over that hundred dollars to Donald Trump but I can't just I can't assume that it's going to happen and I fear that it will not and if that is the case then we need to do what we've known for a long time we need to do we need to win in these midterms we need to run awesome candidates in the next cycle we need to choose the right Democrat in the primary and they need to go on to beat him for re-election and in the long run that might even be better because if he goes down legally even if we know that he broke the law even if they have all of the evidence there will be many Americans who simply won't accept it but if he's destroyed in an actual election a fair election that's a little bit harder for some of them to fight against the fight will continue but it'll be a little bit harder for them anyway those are my thoughts I'm gonna go finish my workout I'm gonna fix the title by the way since it seemed to have really pissed off a lot of people but anyway thank you for watching this let me know what you think you can by the way you can message me on twitter at john ida rolla also follow twitter a damage report there at the damage report you'll find out about all that we're doing on that show the upcoming guests that we have some awesome guests and thank you see you soon
