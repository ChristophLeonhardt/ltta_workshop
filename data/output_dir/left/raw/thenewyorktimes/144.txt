1
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,530
Saul Martinez 
spent six days

2
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,540
at a border patrol
detention center in 2014,

3
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,200
after a month-long
trek from El Salvador.

4
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,810
He was part of the
surge of children

5
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,970
who arrived at the
southern border alone,

6
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,790
mostly from Central America.

7
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,490
And back then, like now,
the government wrestled

8
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,480
with how to handle thousands
of children caught up

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,230
in the immigration system.

10
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,380
“We now have an actual
humanitarian crisis on the border

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,230
that only underscores the 
need to drop the politics

12
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,070
and fix our immigration 
system once and for all.”

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,774
Images like these
led to public outcry

14
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,620
on the treatment of
vulnerable children.

15
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,350
But he did tell his story 
when he testified

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,760
before members of Congress.

17
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,320
The panel wanted to hear 
why he had come.

18
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,540
He wanted to tell them 
what had happened

19
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,740
once he arrived.

20
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,990
He remembers the
rooms being filled

21
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,690
with children 
and mothers waiting

22
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,190
for their names to be called.

23
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,720
After six days, he was flown 
to a shelter in Miami,

24
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,800
run by a separate 
government agency.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,750
He says it was
very comfortable.

26
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,715
And on Mother’s Day, 
he was finally reunited

27
00:02:32,715 --> 00:02:33,715
with his mother.

28
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,750
Four years later, 
Saul has a green card,

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,020
a job and one year 
left of high school.

30
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,940
And there is 
a new crisis unfolding

31
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,330
at the southern border.

32
00:02:46,330 --> 00:00:00,000
But for kids like Saul, it feels 
like history is repeating itself.
