our former reporter Lauren southern was banned from entering the United Kingdom this week she was taking a bus in from France via the Channel Tunnel when her passport was scanned in Calais France something came up in the system and she was pulled aside by police for questioning and they detained her if you can believe it under the powers of the Terrorism Act the Terrorism Act held for hours and for the first hour no right to a lawyer no right to remain silent either that's a special provision under the Terrorism Act and it makes sense it's the ticking time bomb scenario where minutes counts so the balance of interests according to the UK Parliament the passed this law is to allow police to search things that a terrorist would have without a search warrant without even any reason for suspicion to detain people and require them to answer questions it's a very powerful law but it was used against Lauren's southern not because she's a terrorist of course but because of her right-wing activism let's start by saying the obvious we believe in borders it's really the essential definition of a country a place that is geographically defined and defended and subject to the rule of law without borders you don't have a country and without the power to keep people out of those borders you don't have a country in any meaningful sense and without you know people who are citizens of your country having privileges that foreigners don't have you don't have a country it's like your own home if it didn't have walls on the door it wouldn't really be a home and if you didn't have the power to determine who can come in and who can't it really wouldn't be your home and if the people who lived in it didn't have some privileges and strangers didn't maybe he really wouldn't be home basic stuff but we have to restate basic things these days so we believe in borders and the right to exclude others though the UK government doesn't seem to be doing that there are 23,000 Muslim jihadis on a UK police watchlist of course you can't actually watch twenty three three twenty three thousand people in any meaningful sense they roam around the UK with impunity many of them are foreigners like Justin Trudeau in Canada the UK happily welcomes back Isis terrorists turning from Syria and Iraq these are murderers and rapists who are the extremely explicit rationale for the terrorism act that's that's why the law was passed and yet they returned unimpeded to the UK they do not hide by the way there is no need to hide because the UK does not catch them or prosecute them or expel them they literally hold protests in the streets promising that they will turn the UK into a Muslim dictatorship a theocracy like they were trying to do with the Islamic state in Iraq and Syria and now that law is being used to stop Lauren Southern from entering the UK here's the letter she was handed by the border police explaining why she's banned I got a quote from it by your own admission on the 24th February 2018 you were involved in the distribution of racist material in Luton I believe that your actions whilst in the United Kingdom present a threat to the fundamental interests of society and to the public policy of the United Kingdom and then they barred her from coming into the UK here's the so-called racist material she was handing out in Luton it's a joke a social experiment of sorts taking a left-wing campaign about Jesus and just swapping in the word Allah instead Allah is gay Allah is trans Allah is all of us etc here's Lauren on the streets in Luton with signs on a rainbow gay colours saying Allah is a gay God now it was styled as a prank a peaceful activists praying to show the conflict between Islam and homosexuality and to show that how society treats criticism of Jesus and Christianity is different from how society treats criticism of Allah and Islam here's one what a thousand left-wing think pieces about Jesus and homosexuality and interpretations of Christianity was Jesus gay now is that racist like the police say it is of course not maybe it's rude I don't know how about saying Allah was gay how is that even racist what's the race in question Allah isn't even a person Muhammad was Allah is the Muslim name for God God isn't doesn't even have a race Muslims can be of any race so where's the racism there and look at the rest of the police letter she's banned because she is a threat to the fundamental interests of society and to the public policy of the UK now that's laughable on the face with that this 22-year old woman is a dire threat to the fundamental interests of society that she could be like Samson and make the whole house fall down look 400 Isis terrorists returning is no biggy to the UK just the vibrant diversity of multiculturalism but that little prank is such a risk to society that she's detained by anti-terrorism cops now the woman on the left of that picture in that prank her name is Britney Pettibone she's a youtuber also right-wing she talks about ethnic nationalism some people call that racism some people say that's it's just anti open borders anti global ism I really haven't watched enough of Brittany Benny Benny bones work to know but but I think that's the point I don't think the border police have immersed themselves in the political commentary of Lauren southern or Britney Pettibone and truly understand their ideology and even if they did that's not the purpose of the terrorism act it is to stop terrorism which is violence not to stop peaceful YouTube commentators from talking about public policy now I haven't watched most of what Lauren southern has said in her video since she left the rebel but I am sure it's peaceful and non terroristic same with Brittany Pettibone but she was detained last week - Brittany was trying to get into the UK let me show you her letter and you'll have a tough time believing that this letter is real there are so many spelling errors in it it's a laugh but let me read it to you you have asked for leave to enter the United Kingdom as a visitor for five day not days but as you stated in your interview I have reason to believe that you were seeking admission to the United Kingdom to interview Tommy Robinson a far-right leader whose materials and speeches incite racial hatred and then they go on a bit to talk about Pettibone's boyfriend who is a political activist and they described his group this way which is viewed in the UK as a right-wing organization and then and with that same line from Lauren southern cider above being a serious threat to the UK so so let's unpack Brittany Pettibone's letter a bit she's banned from the UK not because she has done anything she hasn't even handed out the joke flyers at a gay ala event she's banned because she wants to meet with our other former reporter Tommy Robinson just to meet with him to talk to him by the way you are allowed to meet with anyone in the UK you can even go to a prison and meet with a murderer during visiting hours that is not against the law but now apparently just going to meet with Tommy Robinson is considered grounds to be banned from the whole country and they say Tommy's materials and speeches incite racial hatred that's what the letter said yeah no they don't I know Tommy pretty well after working with him for a year I've probably visited him a half dozen times I've met his best friend since childhood who just happens to be a black man who worked with us - for the rebel I wouldn't mention that because it's irrelevant and - Tommy race is irrelevant anyone who knows anything about Tommy knows that he doesn't have a racist bone in his body he grew up in a racially mixed community in Luton in fact Tommy like me is a big fan of Sikhs and they love him Tommy is against Islamism that is political Islam and its violent expression through jihad that is that's not a race but even if that was racist somehow even if Tommy were racist is it now against the law to meet with people who have bigoted beliefs because like I said there are 23,000 Gianni's walking around the UK who don't just have hard feelings towards infidels that they keep quietly in their hearts they positively want to do something with their hate they want to fight and kill for Allah whether he's gay or not and Pettibone is banned because her boyfriend's group is quote viewed in the UK as right-wing so so her boyfriend's group is right-wing according to some people in the UK it is right-wing I think even though others might disagree but but is that enough to ban someone from a country because their boyfriend is right-wing and they want to meet with Tommy Robinson I say again the UK has the absolute right to keep out foreigners that's that's my view at least you self doesn't seem to follow that rule they take endless migrants especially the Muslim and jihadist variety it doesn't seem to be working out so well for them yesterday news broke about a small city in the UK called Telford just 150 thousand people where Pakistani Muslim rape gangs had over the years methodically trapped and Exploited and gang-raped a thousand girls again and again and again a thousand girls from a thousand families in the city of just 150 thousand people there probably wasn't a single person in the whole town who didn't know someone or know someone who knew someone who was raped again and again by Pakistani Muslims in fact there were even murders in ours and then yet authorities did nothing for years for fear of being called you guessed it racist and right-wing so yeah open borders for Pakistani Muslim rapists closed borders for girlfriends of right-wingers who want to talk to Tommy Robinson and for a prank about gay Allah the UK has the power to close its borders but that power is limited by law and let me close by reading to you from the official UK police guide to schedule seven of the Terrorism Act that was used to detain these people because let me read it to you it's important it's about abusing the law let me quote schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act provides these officers with unique powers to examine police people who pass through the United Kingdom's borders it is essential that they are applied professionally so that the police maintain the confidence of all sections of the public any misuse of these powers could have a far-reaching negative impact on police community relations and hinder progress made in support of the government's counterterrorism strategy unquote I have just read to you from an internal police teaching document above the Terrorism Act warning people not to a beauty queen morning police not to abuse the powers just like in the United States when their Foreign Intelligence Surveillance courts were abused by Barack Obama and the Democrats to spy on Donald Trump's campaign these extremely powerful invasive laws were designed to stop real terrorists not to stop political opponents same with the UK terrors it is designed to stop jihadis not to be used to falsely detain and exclude right-wing journalists and activists while letting the jihadis in this is the new normal the UK has done this to other conservatives and others warning about Islam our friends Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer of jihad watch it is censorship it is political abuse but worse it is an admission by the United Kingdom that their police find it easier to stop the people warning about Islamic extremism than to stop economic extremism itself that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the
