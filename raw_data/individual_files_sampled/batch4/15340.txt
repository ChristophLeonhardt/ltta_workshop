on the campaign trail Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford was consistent with his messaging he would be beholden to the party's grassroots and stand up to the elitists so why is it that with every passing day Doug Ford is looking more and more like the second coming of the backstabber that was Patrick Brown make no mistake social conservative Tonia Granick Ellen was Doug Ford's kingmaker if Tonya hadn't thrown her hat in the PC leadership ring and if most of her supporters had not shifted their support to Doug in the second ballot of the leadership race well it is Christine Elliot who is the leader of this PC party today oh sure Ford was ever so grateful for Tonya support then but clearly politics PC style is a matter of what have you done for me lately baby case in point the Liberals aided and abetted by their useful idiots in the media party dredged up comments made several years ago by Tonya she has or had a problem with gay marriage so that makes her a homophobe she has or had a problem with the dehumanizing haberdashery that is the burqa so that makes her an islamaphobe however Ford realizing that Tonya is a smart and savvy candidate and someone who slaughtered her competition at her nomination meeting last month and someone he owes his political career to well Doug had tan his back oh he had her back all right except Tonya was on a plank and Ford was wielding a broadsword and just like that Ford's kingmaker was deemed to be damaged goods and press though she's now yesterday's news you know it all reminds me of the brilliant interrogation scene in the 2008 film The Dark Knight in which the Joker tells Batman that the Caped Crusader himself will only be tolerated by the Gotham elites as long as he serves a purpose but once Batman outlives his usefulness well let's hear it from the late great Heath Ledger himself don't talk like one of them you're not even if you'd like to be to them you're just a freak like me they need you right now when they don't they'll cast you out like a leper you see their morals their code it's a bad joke dropped at the first sign of trouble the only as good as the world allows them to be I'll show you when the chips are down these are these civilized people they'll eat each other and so it is that tan your granny Kalyn has been sacrificed upon the altar of political correctness but if we're now in some perverse game of dredging up comments made from many moons ago that no longer passes the PC PC sniff test who else is about to walk that progressive plank well as I predicted on the very day he was appointed the next candidate to be ejected may very well be ex rebel media contributor Andrew Lawton the Sharks are already circling Andrew and they smell blood Lawton has been labeled everything from a homophobe to a misogynist for comments he made years ago as a radio host now Andrew lund is a good man and he was a superb radio broadcaster but instead of stating that the comments he made from yesteryear are less politically correct time perhaps he is now saying that those comments were made when he was suffering from mental illness now I know Andrew lund has suffered from mental illness and I would never want to make light of that but moving forward will the media party and the liberal elites now equate anyone espousing conservative viewpoints as being well you know mentally ill but the question arises is this indeed the new normal that a statement from the past that's now considered to be offside by the mavens of political correctness is sufficient to sink a political career even before it begins another thing about the growth tasks pile on Tonya Granick Allen endured was how Doug Ford who has often expressed outright disdain for the media party and their vindictive methods now seems to be all about appeasing them so when the Toronto Star and The Globe and Mail and the CBC scream homophobia and Islamophobia and other assorted flavor of the month phobias once upon a time Doug would have fired back with both guns blazing now he waves the white flag of surrender Doug have you already forgotten what the media party did to your brother or is Rob like Tonya just so much collateral damage to be ignored in your quest for power moving forward my political advice to Doug Ford would be this watch your back after all could there be a damning statement or photograph or video of Doug Ford out there showing the premiere and waiting doing something you know improper already there are whisper campaigns to this effect maybe it's also much salacious smoke that doesn't lead to any kind of factual fire but maybe there's something from the past that will come back to haunt them and as we all witnessed in January the PCs have absolutely no problem with staging an instant palace coup so Doug good luck with these vipers that you have welcomed into your inner circle and how does that old saying go again you know live by the sword for the rebel dawn media I'm
