INTERVIEWS?
>> YES, MA'AM.
>> SENATOR DURBIN.
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.
DR. CHRISTINE FORD SET IN THAT
CHAIR AND SHE SAID CLEARLY THAT
SHE WAS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL
ASSAULT OF YOUR HANDS.
SHE ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS
DIRECTLY, AND SHE DIDN'T FLINCH
AT THE PROSPECT OF AN FBI
INVESTIGATION.
WE KNOW AND SHE'S BEEN ADVISED
THAT A PERSON LYING TO THE FBI
CAN FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
YOU HAVE CLEARLY AND
UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED THAT YOU
ASSAULTED DR. FORD.
WITH THAT STATEMENT, YOU MUST
BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OR ANY
CREDIBLE WITNESS THAT CAN PROVE
OTHERWISE.
YOU STARTED OFF WITH AN
IMPASSIONED STATEMENT AT THE
BEGINNING AND I CAN IMAGINE, TRY
TO IMAGINE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH AND YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN
THROUGH AND I'M SURE I WOULDN'T
GET CLOSE TO IT.
BUT IT WAS --
>> YOU WOULDN'T.
>> I'M SURE I WOULDN'T.
IT'S AN IMPASSIONED STATEMENT.
IN THE COURSE OF IT, YOU SAID "I
WELCOME ANY KIND OF
INVESTIGATION."
I QUOTE YOU.
I WELCOME ANY KIND OF
INVESTIGATION.
I'VE GOT A SUGGESTION FOR YOU.
RIGHT NOW, TURN TO YOUR LEFT IN
THE FRONT ROW TO DON McGAHN,
COUNSEL TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND
ASK HIM TO SUSPEND THIS HEARING
AND NOMINATION PROCESS UNTIL THE
FBI COMPLETES ITS INVESTIGATION
OF THE CHARGES MADE BY DR. FORD
AND OTHERS AND GOES TO BRING THE
WITNESSES FORWARD AND PROVIDES
THAT INFORMATION TO THIS
HEARING.
I'M SURE THAT THE CHAIRMAN AT
THAT POINT WILL UNDERSTAND THAT
THAT IS A REASONABLE REQUEST TO
FINALLY PUT TO REST THESE
CHARGES IF THEY ARE FALSE OR TO
PROVE THEM IF THEY ARE NOT.
YOU SPENT TWO YEARS IN THE WHITE
HOUSE OFFICE THAT PROVED
JUDICIAL NOMINEES.
YOU TURNED TO THE FIB OVER AND
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THEIR
WORK.
LET'S BRING THEM IN HERE AND
NOW.
TURN TO DON McGAHN AND TELL HIM
IT'S TIME TO GET THIS DONE.
AN FBI INVESTIGATION IS THE ONLY
WAY TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS.
>> SENATOR --
>> STOP THE TALK.
THIS COMMITTEE IS RUNNING THIS
HEARING.
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT DON
McGAHN, NOT EVEN YOU AS A
NOMINEE.
WE'RE -- WE ARE HERE TODAY
BECAUSE DR. FORD ASKED FOR AN
OPPORTUNITY HERE.
I KNOW YOU DID TOO AS WELL.
IN FACT, MAYBE EVEN BEFORE SHE
DID.
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE WANTED
TO BE HEARD FROM CHARGES THAT
THEY ALL THOUGHT WERE UNFAIR OR
ACTIVITIES LIKE SEXUAL ASSAULT
WAS UNFAIR.
SO I WANT TO ASSURE SENATOR
DURBIN REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU
SAY TO SENATOR -- DON McGAHN,
WE'RE NOT SUSPENDING THIS
HEARING.
PROCEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION
OR WHATEVER OR IF THE --
>> I JUST SAY THIS.
IF YOU, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, TURNS
TO DON McGAHN AND TO THIS
COMMITTEE AND TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF THE TRUTH OF THIS, I'M
NOT GOING TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO
AN FBI INVESTIGATION, I HOPE ALL
THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE
WOULD SAY WE'RE GOING TO ABIDE
BY YOUR WISHES AND WE'LL HAVE
THAT INVESTIGATION.
>> I WELCOME WHATEVER THE
COMMITTEE WANTS TO DO.
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO.
>> I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
TO DO.
>> I'M INNOCENT.
THEY DON'T REACH CONCLUSIONS.
YOU REACH CONCLUSIONS.
>> THEY INVESTIGATE.
>> YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
CAN'T SAY THAT I WELCOME --
>> THIS WAS SPRUNG ON ME AT THE
LAST MINUTE AND AFTER BEING HELD
BY STAFF, YOU KNOW, AND I CALLED
FOR A HEARING IMMEDIATELY.
>> IF THERE'S NO TRUTH TO HER
CHARGES, THE FBI INVESTIGATION
WILL SHOW THAT.
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT
NOT?
>> THE FBI DOES NOT REACH -- YOU
KNOW THIS IS -- YOU KNOW THAT'S
A PHONY QUESTION.
THE FBI DOESN'T REACH
CONCLUSIONS.
THEY PROVIDE THE 302s.
302s, SO I CAN EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE
THAT DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
THEY JUST GO AND DO WHAT YOU'RE
DOING.
ASK QUESTIONS AND TYPE UP A
RECORD.
THEY DON'T --
>> THERE MORNING I ASKED
DR. FORD ABOUT THIS INCIDENT
WHERE SHE RAN TO MARK JUDGE AT
SAFEWAY.
SHE SAID SURE, I REMEMBER THAT.
SIX WEEKS AFTER THIS OCCURRENCE.
WELL, SOMEONE AT THE "WASHINGTON
POST" WENT IN AND TOOK A LOOK AT
MANY JUDGE'S BOOK AND HAS BEEN
ABLE TO -- THE RUN THAT HE ROW
ABOUT HIS ADDICTION AND
ALCOHOLISM.
THEY HAVE NARROWED IT DOWN WHAT
THEY THINK WAS A PERIOD OF TIME,
THE SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AFTER THE
EVENT.
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING AT
THE SAFEWAY AT THAT POINT.
SO THE POINT I'M GETTING TO, WE
AT LEAST CAN CONNECT SOME DOTS
HERE AND GET SOME INFORMATION.
WHY --
>> THERE'S NO DOTS.
>> WHY WOULD YOU RESIST THAT
INVESTIGATION?
>> SENATOR, I WELCOME -- I
WANTED THE HEARING LAST WEEK.
>> I'M ASKING ABOUT THE FBI
INVESTIGATION.
>> THE COMMITTEE FIGURES OUT HOW
TO ASK THE QUESTIONS.
I'LL DO WHATEVER.
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE MULTIPLE
TIMES --
>> WILL YOU SUPPORT AN FBI
INVESTIGATION --
>> I'LL DO WHATEVER THE
COMMITTEE --
>> PERSONALLY DO YOU THINK THAT
IS THE BEST THING FOR US TO DO?
>> YOU WON'T ANSWER?
>> LOOK, SENATOR, I -- I'VE SAID
I WANTED A HEARING.
SAID I WAS WELCOME TO ANYTHING.
I'M INNOCENT.
THIS THING WAS -- HELD, HELD
WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN
PRESENTED IN THE ORDINARY WAY.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN HELD AND
HANDLED CONFIDENTIALLY AT FIRST,
WHICH IS WHAT DR. FORD'S WISHES
WERE, AS I UNDERSTAND IT.
IT WOULDN'T HAVE CAUSED THIS --
DESTROYED MY FAMILY LIKE THIS
EFFORT HAS.
>> I THINK AN FBI INVESTIGATION
WILL HELP ALL OF US ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE ISSUE.
>> SENATOR GRAHAM ASKED FOR THE
FLOOR.
BEFORE HE DOES, IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT -- IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
SOMETHING, YOU HAVE THE WITNESS
RIGHT HERE TO ASK HIM.
SECONDLY IF YOU WANT AN FBI
REPORT, YOU CAN ASK FOR IT
