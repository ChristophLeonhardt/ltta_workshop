THERE IS LITERALLY NO DEFENDING

57
00:01:43,723 --> 00:01:46,860

00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,500
DOES HE NOT BELIEVE IN THE SPARK

SEEN IT ALL AND ALONG COMES

64
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,576
ANOTHER MANIFESTATION OF WHY

65
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:06,012
THEIR POLICIES ARE SO INHUMANE.

66
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:08,080
>> Tucker: THAT'S NOT JUST

67
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,449
DISHONEST THOUGH, OBVIOUSLY.

68
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,449
IT'S A LUNATIC.

69
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:11,952
WHY WOULD THE LEFT TO BE

00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,020
DEFENDING THE COUNTRY'S MOST

71
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,422
VIOLENT STREET GANGS?

72
00:02:15,422 --> 00:02:16,223
TRUMP HAS MADE THEM IRRATIONAL

73
00:02:16,223 --> 00:02:19,259
AS PART OF IT, BUT THE LEFT ALSO

74
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:22,462
SENSES A THREAT TO ITS BASIC

75
00:02:22,462 --> 00:02:22,829
WORLDVIEW.

76
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:25,265
IT'S A LIVING REMINDER THAT THE

77
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:26,666
LEFT'S POSITION ON IMMIGRATION

78
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,234
IS A LIE.

79
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:32,505
THEY TELL YOU EVERY DAY THAT THE

80
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:34,040
IMMIGRANT IS A FUTURE BRAIN

81
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,744
SURGEON OR TECH FOUNDER,

82
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:38,912
THEREFORE CONTROL IS

83
00:02:38,912 --> 00:02:40,947
UNNECESSARY.

84
00:02:40,947 --> 00:02:44,417
AND, MOST PEOPLE SEND THEIR

85
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:45,886
PEOPLE HERE, AND THEY ARE NOT

86
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,020
THE BEST.

87
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,422
SOME OF THEM ARE GREAT, SOME ARE

88
00:02:49,422 --> 00:02:52,325
THOUGH AND SOME JOINT MS-13.

89
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:54,027
THE SAME BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T

90
00:02:54,027 --> 00:02:54,694
ALL THE SAME.

91
00:02:54,694 --> 00:02:56,463
THAT'S THE POINT OF THE

92
00:02:56,463 --> 00:02:57,063
IMMIGRATION LAW.

93
00:02:57,063 --> 00:02:58,665
THEY ARE NOT THE SAME AND WE

94
00:02:58,665 --> 00:03:00,267
SHOULD SORT THE GOOD FROM THE

95
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:02,936
BAD.

96
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,137
LEFT, I WOULD SUGGEST THIS MIGHT

97
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:07,073
BE A REAL COUNTRY WHOSE ACTUAL

98
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:08,108

99
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:09,609

109
00:03:26,626 --> 00:03:28,428
TO THE MODERN LEFT, YOU ARE NOT

110
00:03:28,428 --> 00:03:30,263
UN-AMERICAN WITH CULTURE AND

111
00:03:30,263 --> 00:03:31,431
HISTORY AND COLLECTIVE IDENTITY.

112
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,266
YOU ARE A CITIZEN OF THE

113
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:36,803
ECONOMY, A COG IN THE MACHINE OF

114
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:37,637
GLOBAL CAPITALISM.

115
00:03:37,637 --> 00:03:40,006
AMERICA IS JUST ANOTHER PRIVATE

116
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:41,007
EQUITY SCHEMED TO SOME.

117
00:03:41,007 --> 00:00:00,000
THEIR PLEDGE IS DIFFERENT THAN
