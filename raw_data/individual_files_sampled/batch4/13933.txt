if you're like seven in ten Americans you probably haven't heard anything at all without Planned Parenthood killing unborn babies and then selling their body parts to the highest bidder you've probably heard about a random dentist killing a magic lion out in Zimbabwe you've probably heard about Miley Cyrus's armpit hair but the media don't want you to know that your tax dollars are funding the mass murder and organ harvesting of actual children in the womb I'm Ben Shapiro and this is hardware so why are the media covering up the brutality of Planned Parenthood because it might make you uncomfortable worse it might make Democrats uncomfortable because Democrats love Planned Parenthood the Democratic party platform stands for the ability of a woman to crush her baby's head one minute before birth and they want you to pay for it it's actually in their platform quote Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a woman's right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy including a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay President Obama is a state senator in Illinois he actually called for a fully-formed living baby to be killed after birth he said such a child was merely a fetus outside of the mother's womb that's how Democrats think we have a non gruesome tape here's a top Planned Parenthood doctor talking about how to use less crunchy techniques to kill babies so that their organs can be more easily sold and here's another top Planned Parenthood doctor talking about the ease with which baby intestines can be harvested and eyeballs can be extracted these orbits are good too because then at this stage you start to get the retinal pigment epithelium which is in the back which is you've collected that before it's just a lightful a third top Planned Parenthood doctor negotiated over baby body part prices while standing over a tray of dissected children I think the I think that per item thing works a little better just because you can see how much we get out of it now naturally Hillary Clinton thinks the people who do this are just wonderful I'm proud to stand with Planned Parenthood but when Hillary Clinton is shown video of Planned Parenthood doctors talking about selling organs even she pretends to find it quote disturbing people who claim they're disturbed by the sale of baby organs but are totally fine with the crushing of their heads are moral idiots it's like saying you're disturbed by the flipping of American slaves but not by anyone holding them as slaves in the first place here's the truth abortion ends a human life the science is settled by three weeks after sperm meets egg the baby's brain spinal cord heart and other organs begin forming that's about the time when most women notice they're pregnant in the first place by week four we've got early facial features by week seven the baby has toes by week nine the baby is developing external genitalia by week ten the baby has started growing fingernails and that's all in the first trimester that's the least controversial abortion period but we treat these innocent human lives as junk for the garbage disposal during the first three months of pregnancy doctors plunge it to with an edged tip into the womb they then use the suction power of the tube to literally tear apart the child while it's alive and then suck the pieces out of the mother's womb this is called suction aspiration unpleasant try dilation and curettage in this version of abortion doctors use a curette which chops up the baby inside the womb and then scrapes it right out as the baby grows the methods of abortion get uglier and uglier there's dilation and evacuation in which doctors use a forceps to crush the baby including its brain and spine the pieces are then removed and as a last resort doctors use partial of abortion Democrats love partial-birth abortion this is a procedure in which doctors use an ultrasound they find a baby's legs with the forceps they pull it into the birth canal they deliver the entire baby except for the head and then they stab the baby in the skull with a scissors insert a suction tube into the skull and suck out the brains this is also the preferred method for ensuring that the internal organs are best preserved so Planned Parenthood can hock them to Big Pharma taken in total these various forms of abortion and others are used to murder approximately 3,000 babies every single day in America that's over a million babies a year that's 55 million children since roe v wade the media want to keep us blind to these facts or perhaps we want to blind ourselves but by blinding ourselves to murder we become complicit in it
