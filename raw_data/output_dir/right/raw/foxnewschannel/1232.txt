1
00:00:10,854 --> 00:00:11,922
>> Laura: TIME FOR FRIDAY

2
00:00:11,922 --> 00:00:16,760
FOLLIES.

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,428
IS THAT REALLY FOLLIES?

4
00:00:18,428 --> 00:00:20,263
>> THE FOLLIES LOOKS A LITTLE

5
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:20,964
BEATEN UP.

6
00:00:20,964 --> 00:00:22,098
A LITTLE BEATEN UP.

7
00:00:22,098 --> 00:00:28,405
>> Laura: THAT'S OKAY.

8
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,042
SAMANTHA BEE'S APOLOGY TO IVANKA

9
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,610
TRUMP SEEMS FAKE.

10
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,880
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID, "THE NEW

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,348
YORK TIMES" BEST SELLING AUTHOR,

12
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:40,250
RAYMOND IS GOING TO TELL US,

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,086
RAYMOND, THIS WAS A TELEVISION

14
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:44,187
AWARDS CEREMONY.

15
00:00:44,187 --> 00:00:45,088
WHAT GREAT TIMING.

16
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:46,923
>> THIS IS FROM THE TELEVISION

17
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,792
ACADEMY, THAT GRANTS THE EMMYS.

18
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:51,461
THEY GAVE SAMANTHA A SPECIAL

19
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:54,664
AWARD, SAMANTHA BEE, FOR HER

20
00:00:54,664 --> 00:00:55,498
SOCIAL ACTIVISM.

21
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:59,202
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO TOLD IVANKA

22
00:00:59,202 --> 00:01:01,538
TRUMP, YOU'RE A FECKLESS "C"

23
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:02,906
WORD AND YOU SHOULD WEAR

24
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,674
SOMETHING TIGHT AND LOW-CUT SO

25
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:06,343
YOUR FATHER WILL CHANGE YOUR

26
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:08,078
IMMIGRATION POLICIES.

27
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:09,679
SHE HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

28
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:12,515
BUT THE CEREMONY IN WHICH THE

29
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,851
MEDIA WASN'T ALLOWED INTO, WE

30
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:16,286
DON'T HAVE THE AUDIO, BUT WE

31
00:01:16,286 --> 00:01:17,554
HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT.

32
00:01:17,554 --> 00:01:18,555
HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID.

33
00:01:18,555 --> 00:01:21,091
WE SPENT THE DAY WRESLING WITH

34
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:24,594
THE REPERCUSSIONS OF ONE BAD

35
00:01:24,594 --> 00:01:25,295
WORD WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE ALL

36
00:01:25,295 --> 00:01:26,529
SPENT THE DAY AS A NATION THAT

37
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:27,897
WE ARE WRENCHING CHILDREN FROM

38
00:01:27,897 --> 00:01:29,165
THEIR PARENTS.

39
00:01:29,165 --> 00:01:31,935
NOW, IT WASN'T ONE WORD, IT WAS

40
00:01:31,935 --> 00:01:34,904
ALSO THE CONTEXT THAT SOMEHOW

41
00:01:34,904 --> 00:01:35,939
IVANKA TRUMP SHOULD TART UP TO

42
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:37,273
GET HER FATHER'S ATTENTION.

43
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,942
THAT WAS NEVER ADDRESSED AT ALL

44
00:01:38,942 --> 00:01:40,777
EITHER IN THE APOLOGY OR HERE.

45
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:42,912
>> Laura: THE FACT THAT IVANKA

46
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,216
TRUMP WAS HOLDING UP HER INFANT

47
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,084
SON, LIKE THAT WAS AN AFFRONT TO

48
00:01:48,084 --> 00:01:48,952
SAMANTHA BEE.

49
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:50,587
SHE'S TRASHED ME -- LET ME HOLD

50
00:01:50,587 --> 00:01:51,788
IT UP.

51
00:01:51,788 --> 00:01:52,956
IT ACTUALLY WORKS AGAINST

52
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:56,626
VAMPIRES, SAMANTHA.

53
00:01:56,626 --> 00:02:00,663
SHE'S TRASHED ME FOR THAT.

54
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:00,914
ACTUAL LIP

55
00:02:00,914 --> 00:02:01,765
ACTUAL LI

56
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:02,599
ACTUALLY, DO WE WANT TO PLAY THE

57
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:02,899
CLIP?

58
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,668
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

59
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:06,803
WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT THE

60
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:09,172
LIGHT OF DAY.

61
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:13,143
SO SHE CONTINUES TO BE PRESENT,

62
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:14,677
CLAIMING SHE'S SORRY, MOVE IT TO

63
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:16,813
THE POLITICAL CONVERSATION.

64
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:20,083
WHO DIED AND MADE HER HEAD OF

65
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:21,284
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL?

66
00:02:21,284 --> 00:02:24,687
>> HERE SHE IS, CALLING A WOMAN,

67
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:28,058
REDUCING A WOMAN TO GENITAL YEAH

68
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:30,427
WITH THIS HORRIBLE WORD.

69
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:31,694
NOW THE PRESIDENT STARTED

70
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:32,929
TWEETING.

71
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:33,930
NATURALLY, HIS DAUGHTER WAS

72
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,731
ATTACKED HERE.

73
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:35,932
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID.

74
00:02:35,932 --> 00:02:39,169
WHY AREN'T THEY FIRING NO-TALENT

75
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:42,605
SAMANTHA BEE FOR THE LOW-RATING

76
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:42,906
SKILL.

77
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:43,940
A TOTAL DOUBLE STANDARD.

78
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:44,407
THAT'S OKAY.

79
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:45,608
WE'RE WINNING.

80
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,811
AND WE'LL BE DOING SO FOR A LONG

81
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,745
TIME.

82
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:52,215
>> Laura: I LIKE HOW WINNING IS

83
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:52,615
CAPITALIZED.

84
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:55,518
NOT CLEAR WHY, BUT I'LL LIKE IT.

85
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,420
>> BRIAN JUMPED INTO THIS AND

86
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,421
SAID THE PRESIDENT HAS GONE TOO

87
00:02:58,421 --> 00:02:58,688
FAR.

88
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,124
LET'S WATCH.

89
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:04,227
>> IT SEEMS, BRIAN, LIKE THE

90
00:03:04,227 --> 00:03:05,595
PRESIDENT'S FOLLOWING A LOT OF

91
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:09,232
CONSERVATIVE PUNDITS JUMPING ON

92
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,568
THE DOUBLE STANDARD BANDWAGON.

93
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:12,735
>> SOMETHING WE HEAR ALMOST

94
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,138
EVERY DAY ON THE PRESIDENT'S

95
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:17,307
FAVORITE FOX NEWS TOX SHOWS,

96
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:19,609
TAPPING INTO THE VICTIMHOOD,

97
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:20,810
CONSERVATIVES ARE TREATED IN THE

98
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,680
WORST WAY THAN LIBERALS.

99
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,515
IN THIS CASE ROSEANNE BARR

100
00:03:25,515 --> 00:03:27,917
TREATED WORSE THAN SAMANTHA BEE.

101
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:30,920
>> THEY'RE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE

102
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,624
THE PRESIDENT IS BLAMED FOR THE

103
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:36,693
FOUL-MOUTHED COMEDIENNES.

104
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:39,095
THEY EXISTED BEFORE TRUMP,

105
00:03:39,095 --> 00:03:40,830
THEY'LL EXIST AFTER TRUMP.

106
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,700
SAMANTHA BEE'S RATINGS ARE DOWN

107
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,368
BY ALMOST HALF.

108
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,370
>> Laura: HE'S WINNING ON

109
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,105
ECONOMY, ON TRADE, FOCUS ON THE

110
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,773
SUBSTANCE, WHO CARES WHAT --

111
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,576
>> BUT CAN HE MATCH OBAMA'S "THE

112
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:56,813
FINAL YEAR" THE HBO DOCUMENTARY,

113
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:58,882
LIKE AN EXTENDED WEST

114
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:04,154
WING PORTRAYED THE NATIONAL

115
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:05,188
SECURITY AN

116
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:05,221
SECURITY APP

117
00:04:05,221 --> 00:04:05,255
SECURITY APPAR

118
00:04:05,255 --> 00:04:05,288
SECURITY APPARAT

119
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:05,321
SECURITY APPARATUS

120
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:05,722
SECURITY APPARATUS.

121
00:04:05,722 --> 00:04:07,457
HERE'S A LITTLE CLIP OF THAT

122
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:07,857
DOCUMENTARY.

123
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:10,026
>> WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE IT

124
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:11,928
WILL BE HARDER TO DISMANTLE IN

125
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:12,629
THE EVENT WE TAKE A DIFFERENT

126
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:19,769
TURN.

127
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:25,175
>> I JUST CAME OUTSIDE TO TRY TO

128
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,910
PROCESS ALL THIS.

129
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,344
I CAN'T PUT IT INTO WORDS.

130
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:31,514
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WORDS ARE.

131
00:04:31,514 --> 00:04:33,816
>> BEN RHODES CAN'T FIND THE

132
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:34,117
WORD.

133
00:04:34,117 --> 00:04:35,518
THEY ALL THOUGHT HILLARY WAS

134
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:36,352
GOING TO WIN.

135
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:39,222
THE "BOSTON GLOBE" WROTE THIS

136
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:41,558
TEAM'S PRAGMATIC IDEALISM ARE

137
00:04:41,558 --> 00:04:43,193
ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WEEP WITH ALL

138
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:44,727
THAT HAS GONE MISSING.

139
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,829
>> Laura: SAMANTHA POWERS WAS

140
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:48,231
UNMASKING INDIVIDUALS EVERY DAY,

141
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:49,332
SOMEHOW OVER AT THE U.N.

142
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:54,370
SHE SAID, WE HAVE TO MAKE IT

143
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,039
FOREIGN POLICY APPARATUS, IRAN

144
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,508
DEAL'S GONE, WHAT ELSE?

145
00:04:58,508 --> 00:04:59,042
>> CLIMATE CHANGE.

146
00:04:59,042 --> 00:04:59,576
>> >> Laura: GONE.

147
00:04:59,576 --> 00:05:00,243
>> AND CUBA.

148
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:02,779
THOSE ARE THE THREE BENCHMARK

149
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,980
THINGS THEY CELEBRATE IN THE

150
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,448
DOCUMENTARY, ON A DAY WHEN

151
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,182
DONALD TRUMP HAS BROUGHT NORTH

152
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:06,983
KOREA TO THE WHITE HOUSE, THIS

153
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,518
IS A HARD DOCUMENTARY TO

154
00:05:08,518 --> 00:05:08,851
SWALLOW.

155
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,620
HOW TIME HAS DEVOURED WHAT WAS

156
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,555
SUPPOSED TO BE THE ULTIMATE

157
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:12,956
NARRATIVE.

158
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:14,290
>> Laura: I WOULD HAVE BEEN

159
00:05:14,290 --> 00:00:00,000
LOVING TO SIT NEXT TO BEN RHODES
