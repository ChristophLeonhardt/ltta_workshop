let's get the thoughts now finesse sabili she's an independent researcher and journalist and photographer too and there's a visited Eastern guter as well just over the last few days I understand so it'll be good to talk to her and Vanessa you're very welcome what was surprising for me during my dad's report there is that despite what 12 people coming out and saying things that completely contradict what the West is saying there's no discussion it's just completely dismissed were you surprised by that I'm sadly no I wasn't surprised and I'm certainly not well actually I am surprised and I'm shocked the levels to which Western media has stooped over this alleged event in Duma and the moral bankruptcy and degeneracy that we're seeing from Western media I mean to accuse Russia of basically exploiting a child in using the evidence of eleven-year-old Hasan diya after Western media has cynically exploited children throughout the history of this conflict I mean if we don't have to go back too far to remember about our Lovett in East Aleppo whose father had clear links and associations with terrorist groups during the terrorist occupation of East Aleppo and how Barna allure beds testimony as a seven-year-old child was heavily used and I would say abused by Western media to basically promote a military escalation so in other words to promote war what we see with Russia and this event at the OPCW is an attempt to actually calm down on the military escalation and the conflict and please let's not forget when I spoke to people in Duma doctors medical staff in the same hospital in the medical point that received victims on that night they all also told me exactly the same thing as people are now hearing in the Hague and also when I went outside and spoke to civilians only 700 meters away from the alleged attack they were also all saying the same thing to me that there was no chemical weapon attack and in fact in that area it's off we found on that day a new chemical weapon storehouse that was controlled by the terrorist factions which was Jaysh al-islam the saudi-backed terrorist group but there was also another chemical weapon facility not so far away which was completely under the control of Jaysh al-islam and there we did see at least we saw one cylinder that looked very similar to the ones that they are describing as having been used by the syrian army again it's billions in duma but i think also a really important point i want to make on this andrey well the west are crying outrage about the so-called use of this trial what i will say very strongly speaking to the children in Zuma and speaking to their families in Zuma that child and his family will feel tremendous relief that finally their voices are being heard on an international stage because for seven years voices like theirs have been completely muted and ignored and disappeared by Western media I know the OPCW is investigating at the moment but from your own point of view do you feel there's a whole lot more evidence to come out about this alleged attack that could persuade people one way or the other well you know I think one point that murud made is that it is almost whatever evidence is produced now it will be perceived as being influenced by Russia or by Syria I mean we've already seen the British government and and Western media if you like laying the ground for saying that Russia had already pre tampered with the site before the OPCW come in so we can almost predict that if OPCW find no evidence of chemical weapon use in that area the next line will be oh but Russia tampered with it and sanitized and sprayed air freshener around the site before OPCW could get there so you know what is happening now is that we're seeing the skeleton of the Western media propaganda campaign that has been waged against Syria for eight years we're seeing it more and more exposed and more and more vulnerable and fragile to what is effectively evidence that is coming from civilians on the ground in this example in eastern goota for example OPCW found no evidence of chemical of chemicals in the bars of a so-called chemical weapon manufacturing site that was bombed by the tripartite alliance of aggression in France Britain and the United States and yet I've done a very quick check on Google I cannot find a single Western media on a Google search having reported that OPCW found though chemicals in the bars a so-called manufacturing site to the north of Damascus why not why are they not reporting this they were quite happy to accept that the US UK and France claimed there were chemical weapons being manufactured at that site and yet when it's disproven by the very organization that they have put their faith into it's not it doesn't appear to be being reported except by let's say friendly media I mean you talked about perhaps Russian people accusing Russian influence and Syrian influence and the outcome of this investigation but how important is media reporting and how much do you think that will influence things I think media reporting is you know we've we've seen throughout the seven years this this war would not have been maintained without a very state partisan media both in the US and the EU and in the UK it would not have been possible for this water have been maintained without that media intervention and aggression towards I would say the majority of the Syrian people who support not necessarily President Assad you know this is one of these reductionist arguments but who support their own secular state and who will defend their secular state against external hostile influences and so I think what is really important here is is the aggression that was carried out against Syria by the US and France and the UK was unlawful under international law it had no basis in legality and it had you know basically Syria was condemned on the basis of an alleged offense right this is a very dangerous precedent we've seen these countries behave in an unlawful manner but I don't think ever in quite such a precipitous way as theirs that could potentially have taken us to war with Russia inside Syria and we're still I think I believe watching how the media is reacting to to what is unfolding in Duma for example I I don't think we're out of the woods yet I mean I believe it was your representatives at the or the Russian representative at the OPCW who said there are there is potential for further false flag attacks to further escalate this intervention and I think you know we all have to be very aware of this the investigation inside duma we should be looking at both sides you know without this mudslinging that's going on but but the the the aggression carried out by by the UK the US and front should never have happened yeah without this investigation first thinking place that's the important point sure and just on the point you said that both sides should be looked at I mean even when you bring 12 witnesses and sit them down in front of the media to ask them any questions happy that's their opportunity to find out and and and it's just passed off for some sort of stunt by the Russians it's extraordinary isn't it so so basically what they are actually doing is dismissing again the Syrian voice because what all of us have been doing andrew is trying to actually transmit the voices of Syrians that are simply not being heard in the worst and today as I said at the OPCW Russia introduced those Syrian Patriots and witnesses to be the meteor and as you said they've better yet excluded and sensit hmm okay Vanessa look we're gonna have to leave it there but really good to talk to us after noon thanks for coming on to our tea that was a Vanessa Bailey independent researcher journalist and photographer and someone who has been to Easton Gucci just in the last few days to thank you
