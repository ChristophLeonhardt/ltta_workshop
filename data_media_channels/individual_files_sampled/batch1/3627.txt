before I even started running most of my fitness regimen was my arm muscles needed to open a bag of chips but I then read this book Born to Run by Christopher McDougall and I started thinking about running and then I took the next step which is actually running well when I first got into running I my diet did not change actually running was a great excuse to keep eating what I wanted because I thought I'm gonna write it off anyhow so it was just pure bacon diet but I ran the very first run I did was a 5k the first organized run I did was a 5k just to experience with what's that like to be in a race with other people and I lost that as well miserably setting a pattern of consistency I've kept up to this day the one thing I definitely found I relied on immensely was this app called RunKeeper which is a free app mostly on your phone and it literally I never consulted a coach or anybody else really tell me how to prepare for a marathon and it literally took me from never having run all the way to running a marathon just by telling me the schedule of what to run every day another important piece of gears may be surprising to some people is shoes you put them on your feet and run in them you know just thinking about running a marathon I guess I never anticipated that hey this proves what an idiot I am there's a lot of running involved like you know - when I ran the marathon it took almost four and a half hours but you build up steadily to longer longer runs to prepare for that and at some point you're running three hours without a break which is that's a lot of running so I didn't I didn't think about that I mean it's it's pleasurable and in a way and it's very peaceful and solitary but it's a lot of time devoted to run
