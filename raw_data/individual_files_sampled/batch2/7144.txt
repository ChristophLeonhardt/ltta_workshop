Bob Woodward's book is going to be available for public purchase this week and over the weekend he did his round of interviews with major new shows there were a number of comments that he made about oral aberrations he made about portions of his book that have already made news that I think are important to kind of discuss on the show today so let's go to the first video where Woodward talks specifically about Trump officials taking documents off his desk so Trump doesn't carry out disastrous policies people who work for him are worried that he will sign things or give orders that threaten the national security or the financial security of the country or the world aids including then chief economic adviser Gary cone and White House staff secretary Rob Porter literally stole documents like this one off the President's desk in the Oval Office so he wouldn't sign them because they realized that this would endanger the country how do they get away with it he doesn't remember if it's not on his desk if it's not immediately available for action it goes away so the statement that he made about Trump forgetting was the relevant statement that I think a lot of people had questions about how could the president you know demand certain things and then not actually carry it out simply because someone took a paper off his desk or documents off his desk and as Woodward says there he just forgets yeah I mean he's saying politely it's exactly what we told you on day one of this story he's too stupid to realize and too incompetent to realize that they didn't execute his orders so I say he doesn't remember what does that mean does he have dementia I guess that would be worse in a sense but if he doesn't have dementia when you tell people that work for you to do something and they don't do it and you don't notice it's because you're incompetent now look and I let me be fair because running a large organization is not easy so if it was a small thing well if you're president the United States you can get lost in the weeds if it was something that's lower in the chain of command and you didn't hear about it understandable so I'm not trying to be unfair here and it is it's a giant organization the White House and the executive branch but one of the orders he asked for was to kill Bashar al-assad the head of the Syrian government that's not a thing you easily forget it's not a thing down the chain of command no and the defense secretary told you yes sir we'll carry it out right away and Assad remains completely unkilled and so that's saying that you forgot that is saying either yes you have clearly have dementia or you're just such an idiot that anybody can tell you all yes yes sir of course sir and then you don't notice and you forget cuz you're you have no mind at all that's the thing the debate is whether he lost his mind or never had a mind to lose in the first place right so you know you hear all these debates throughout the press regarding how why Trump reacted the way he did which was no reaction at all when members of his own administration didn't carry out tasks that he told them to carry out and so one of the debates was or one of the people in these debates argued well you know people know that Trump is a hyperbolic kind of guy he says things he doesn't mean which is the reason why you know he hasn't been angry that these things haven't been carried out but I genuinely believe from the get-go that he just forgets because he's incompetent and would word based on the hundreds of interviews that he did has you know reinforced that and he has though as the op-ed writer from inside his administration said he has no guiding principles so it's easy like he's like well I wanted you to kill us on today but tomorrow I changed my mind so what difference does it make just and as almost every person involved says you just wait for him to change his mind so just ignore his orders until either he forgets or changes all of his principles the very next day there's all those possibilities but then as a guy who's never had to deal with any consequences in his life for destroying things and even a wake of devastation behind him if they kill Assad or if they don't he'll aside it doesn't matter because he doesn't know the consequences of doing either one so what happens is that great I told him to do that cool and if they it doesn't happen like oh great I told him do it but okay I'm on to the next thing he doesn't think things through enough for it to think oh it didn't get done I wanted to start dead because Internet sentence that next sentence doesn't exist so there's never had to deal with his consequence in his life if you bank robber company you know you're gonna never forget that and you're never gonna go around town everybody I'm the best businessman in the world yeah I've never done anything wrong but normal people will think that but if you bankrupt several and you keep moving on and they keep giving you another chance why would you that's such a good point yeah see out of all those excellent point you just made to me the most important one is the next sentence point right we kill Assad and then so I would think through okay how is Russia going to react because Russia is allies with Assad what is it wrong going to do in response another ally of Assad's are they is hezbollah going to take action because Iran gives them orders to will that affect Israel these are all the rational calculations you should make if you're a President of the United States but for him he doesn't understand the consequences of his actions so he never thinks through the second let alone the third of the four centers so when none of those actions flow if I had made an order like that I'd go well what happened what did Hezbollah attack or was our relationship with Russia oh okay but since he has no mind at all and and doesn't understand consequences he said and he just doesn't even notice it didn't happen come on guys it is the most obvious thing in the world I don't care how much of a trump fan you are you know that ordering Assad's killing and then not having it carried out and you don't notice is a sign of an incredibly stupid person alright so that was you know but just a small snippet of the interview with CBS Woodward also talked about how the Pentagon first realized that Twitter could lead to World War 3 take a look he drafts a tweet saying we were gonna pull out dependents from South Korea family members of the 28 thousand people there that tweet was never sent because of a back-channel message from North Korea that it would regard a pullout of dependence as a sign the US was preparing to attack at that moment there was a sense of profound alarm in the Pentagon leadership that my god one tweet and we have reliable information that the North Koreans are going to read this as an attack is imminent so a couple things there Anna one is I'm surprised is the biggest surprise to me out of all this is that anyone checks his tweets before they're sent oh I didn't know that haven't I maybe for special foreign policy tweets they actually bothered to check them okay but this is an excellent example on to the more serious point of the man who has no understanding of consequences well I'm gonna say that I'm gonna pull those guys out wait wait wait wait there might be consequences that well how will the North Korea's wreck what-what-what's cuss questions I have influenza the ready-to-cook say he went bankrupt six times they were bailed out by mainly two people one was his daddy over and over again by the way this is all facts you could read into it it banned to pay fines for his dad getting him money in ways that were not legal and had to admit it and pay fines for that mm-hmm including just going and buying chips at his casino and then never using them so all this illegal way of funneling Trump money because he's an idiot and his daddy bailed about all those times of course the second daddy is Vladimir Putin after he couldn't get a loan from anyone else he wound up getting loans from Russian banks controlled by the oligarchs so here's a guy who doesn't understand that hey I might accidentally start a war because that would require you to have a second thought in your head and and so one more thing about that it at a different point in the interview Woodward said let's hope to god we don't have a crisis now when I read that by itself I didn't quite understand what you mean like crisis in the White House we already have a crisis know when I read it in context of Sadr in context I understood what he meant if we have something Cuban Missile Crisis oh my god where the president has to be sanctioned cogent and make him world-changing decisions on the spot oh god help us all god help the whole world did nobody knows what he's gonna do even Trump doesn't know what he's gonna do because he's erratic he has no guiding principles and he has no mind to speak up and doesn't understand the consequence of his actions so yet we're playing with fire every minute that he's the president if there is a world changing crisis by the way he might accidentally do the right thing but brace for impact exactly what he's gonna do that's the issue that it's a wild card that you don't know what you're gonna get with Trump and every once in a while even you know for us he'll say something that sounds promising and then he'll immediately backtrack and do something disastrous and it's because he doesn't have any guiding principles you're right jank and when I think about him I often think about George Bush not because I think that they're very similar but I remember when it came to George Bush one of the biggest criticisms was that he had this unearned confidence but now when you have Trump in office and you see his behavior that's unearned confidence the guy has absolutely no intellectual curiosity doesn't have a real understanding of policy both domestic or foreign which is why he's you know treating the trade deals like a child doesn't know or care about the consequences of the trades the trade policies that he's putting out there but more importantly he's unwilling to listen to other people around him and get advice from them he wants to carry out actions unilaterally whereas Bush for as horrible as he was I mean he was overly manipulated by outsiders or or insiders within his administration with Trump he just wants to go at it because he thinks he's the best he thinks he's the brightest he thinks he's always right we had a poll early on in his administration who was dumber George Bush or Donald Trump because don't don't get romantic about George Bush a a very low IQ individual but it but Bush clearly wins on being smarter because at least he has enough self-awareness and intellect to understand how stupid he is yeah that's why he would ask it to a fault ask people hey dick chaney what should i do Oh invade Iraq okay fine right Donald Trump doesn't even have the capacity to understand how maniacally stupid he is right so to give you an example I actually have an example for you can I go to this first because it's somewhat newsworthy so Trump is freaking out over the Woodward book it's obvious based on the number of tweets he's put out in regard to it and so here's the tweet that stood out to me he said the Woodward book is a joke just another assault against me in a barrage of assaults using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources many have already come forward to say the quotes by them like the book are fiction Dems can't stand losing all right the real book no you won't know you won't okay he's not gonna write a book he's not capable of write maybe someone can go straight a book for him but like it gives you a sense of of how how much unearned confidence he has he can't even craft a single tweet without making a mistake in it but he's gonna write a book so he's got a number of books how they were all ghostwritten yes of course he doesn't have the intellectual capacity to write a book not even close in fact almost all of his ghost writers have now come out and said god help us all whatever you do you got to get him out I spent time with him total idiot could couldn't write a sentence let alone a book but forget that a lot of dingoes write for a lot of people they're like no no if you're in the room with him you understand he's a danger to everyone because he's a guy with no conscience no intellect and doesn't realize either so the analogy I use or metaphor I was gonna use is and witches once said about george w bush that he was born on third base and thought he hit a triple donald trump was born on third base and thought he kicked a field goal two easy ways for the young turks one is hit the subscribe button down below then you're a TYT subscriber and second is ring the bell and when you do that on youtube
