The US Army is researching an
anesthetic injection that could
be key in alleviating
symptoms of PTSD,
a disorder that impacts hundreds
of thousands of veterans.
Early clinical experience
with the shots,
known as
Stellate Ganglion Blocks,
have produced promising results.
With troops experiencing near
immediate relief of anxiety,
hyper-vigilance, and
other symptoms,
according to military
researchers.
In the procedure, doctors
inject a local anesthetic into
the right side of the neck,
guiding the needle to the area
around the Stellate Ganglion.
A group of nerves that is part
of a bridge between the brain
and the body, called
the Cervical sympathetic chain.
This chain is part of
the nervous system that prepares
the body for
perceived dangers, and
regulates the fight-or-flight
response.
Sometimes, it can become
dysfunctional, or
activated inappropriately.
The SGB injection temporarily
blocks signals between the brain
and the body.
The precise mechanism for how
this assists with PTSD symptoms
is not fully understood.
But the SGB seems to reset
the sympathetic nervous system.
Doctors who have
administered the injections,
say they firmly
believe it works.
But the wider military
is waiting for
the results from a controlled
trial, currently under way,
before they endorse
the treatment.
The drug is marketed under
the brand name Naropin, and
costs less than $2.00 a dose.
Most patients require
just one injection, but
doctors say some return for
a second shot.
The shot is not
touted as a cure, but
researchers hope it can be used
to erase symptoms, so that
therapy and pharmaceuticals can
achieve long term achievements.
