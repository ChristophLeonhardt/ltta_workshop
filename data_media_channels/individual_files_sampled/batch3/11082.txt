hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle we've all gotten used to it the media hate Trump and the president returns the favoring kind how is this mutually charged hate fest changed media and journalism does the corporate liberal media report the news anymore and is journalism today a fake profession in the service of partisanship crosstalking media Wars I'm joined by my guest Rob table in New York he is a political pundit and journalist contributing to the Huffington Post also New York we have Lionel he is a legal analyst and news decoder at Lionel Mediacom and in Los Angeles very early in the morning we have ronpa County it's a comedian a frequent guest on the Jimmy Dore show and The Young Turks as well as host of his own streaming show get your news on with Ron I love how that rhymes all right gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means they can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate it lino let me go to you first in New York just very broadly speaking how is the media change in the age of Trump because in the age of Trump Trump doesn't change it seems go ahead Lionel in New York okay first of all let's talk about news media versus the media here's how it's changed we often use the term mainstream media to define people like ABC and NBC and MSDN see and fake new CNN that's not mainstream anymore what's mainstream is this what's mainstream right now is podcasting in YouTube and other platforms that is dead that is the star that burned out millions of years ago yet the light still hits us so when we say mainstream the first thing that happened was the recalibration of the term mainstream because what's old is doing what's new is now old that's a very good point but the problem is is that the legacy media still have a huge impact on the population I would say because people believe in the conspiracies that a lot of the former I'm gonna go with your terminology former mainstream media peddle Ron reflect upon that in LA yeah you know I I agree with what Lionel said I I think the term mainstream media is something we have to try to shy away from I like to simply say corporate media all the time because definitionally that's what it is it is a corporate media owned by very high for-profit entities but as far as did the media change in the Trump era I would say the corporate media that we're referring to has not changed in the Trump era I think it's the same formula that they've been going by for a long time now they like hyper-partisan one way or the other they like sensationalism they like to have little fun sound bites and tidbits to to inflate for as long as they can and Trump gives them plenty of those you know Michelle wolf at the White House Correspondents Dinner nailed it she said you guys love Trump just admit it because he's giving them what they want and that's kind of all they care about and as far as news and information in our country not only is it a huge disservice yet but as lionel pointed out it is a sinking Titanic well okay we use that logic there Rob and I just want a quick diversion here then the entire foreign policy elite in the United States must love Vladimir Putin keeps them in in good work okay they since then flowers and champagne at the end of the year you know but Rob if we agree with what Lionel said in and Ranjha said in Los Angeles but there is one thing that is changing is that their ratings are plummeting and this is maybe the only thing that about this old legacy media that's really true and on top of it they want their revenge okay you you have like Facebook teaming up with the Atlantic Council they want to claw it back and it's gonna get nasty people are being demonetised people being shunned and throttled okay so the the old the old media is up to the same habits of trying to control the media space go ahead Rob in New York well we have to realize that media is evolving I'll tell you one thing that hasn't changed my father was a newspaper man I grew up in and around the business I remember as a youngster that there was a conservative advertisement against the New York Times with a picture of Fidel Castro that they put on a bus that said I got my job through the New York Times still makes me laugh out loud so things haven't changed that much but another thing that has changed a monster dovely I worked on and off for time incorporated since 1983 and and for one period for 15 years straight there was a publishing behemoth a colossus that no longer even exists the name was literally pulled off the building no there's no time publication in the time and life building I don't even know if they called the time and life building so the media is evolving in ways that I don't we can even predict Lydell may have a word for it which I'm going to need this Authority afterwards unless we can get a translator it's happening at a pace that that I may not see in my lifetime I don't want to make a prediction do I like where it's going no can I stop it no is it just part of change unfortunately yes hopefully one day it will be for the better Lionel jump in go ahead Peter let me give you an example this past week in New Yorker we just had the up front this is an annual event where everybody used to be it used to be the biggest thing there was this is when all the stars came into town and spoke to the advertisers and the affiliates and it was like almost a mini Academy Awards it is now shrunk it is now minimized to nothing let me tell you what my day is every day we normally look at my wife and I look at our route our kind of media emails and what you will see is you will see for example CBS which has a show at night and the biggest PR arm that will spread through social media the idea that last night there was this monumental event were Colbert or whoever trashed or attacked the president we live now in a clickbait economy let me tell you what also happened recently rosanna rosanna completely changed things because Bob Iger who was very very smart realizes that he owes a fiduciary duty to his shareholders and what America wants believe it or not and this will kill the mainstream or lamestream or or or Ted Baxter media what they don't understand is that the American actual viewer is not somebody in the left-wing right-wing bubble or swamp it's somebody who recognizes the value of let's say a Roseanne and others so while they don't realize it's like I'm telling you again they think that they live in the world of Rachel Maddow that CNN that that people reflect their ideas it's not true it's the opposite okay Ron I mean you do have a prevalence but you know we can always talk about the exception of Fox when it comes to cable you know they certainly make money off of their clickbait but they're not practicing journalism anymore now I mean we can talk about the the the the infrastructure the biz this model not but but the profession itself I mean I watched the cable news because I have to because for my job but I don't see journalism being practiced at all I mean and on top of it it people expressing opinions without really much knowledge I mean it's kind of a lot of dumb people saying dumb things that are very cliche and then some of these issues are really very important go ahead Ron well you know what Peter this is a this is an odd double-edged sword for me because the corporate media in the United States does bother me however if they ever got significantly better I might be out of a job sure I get to exist I get to exist in the capacity that I do because they they are failing so hard but I do see journalism practiced however the practices I see are often the negative types of practices the employing propaganda techniques word associations and stuff like that recently on the show I work for the Jimmy Dore show CNN smeared us and they used a very a very typical propaganda technique in the smear they associated us with other with other types of outlets that what it was not inaccurate association at all but they did that it's an intentional thing when you do then it's a certain type of grouping and of course it's it's a wide wide net so is there some are there some diamonds in the rough sure you know you got to look for it it's not on page one quote-unquote you got a dig for it but it is there but as a whole they're not talking about the things that reflect with average Americans at all I mean there's Harvard studies dedicated to that stuff where they spend about seventy five percent of the time talking about Russia or something like that that's an important issue to about six percent of the population six percent yeah so they're it's kind of just a dungeon it's glad you're the point and they're on the East Coast ok that's it and that's in Washington DC here you know let me go let me go to rob here I mean I think all of you are familiar with I certainly know my audiences Jordan Peterson I think is a very interesting case where I've seen cable news oh it was NBC and then the New York Times I mean what hatchet jobs they do against a guy you can disagree with his approach and and some of the things he has to say I've Airy much appreciate what he's doing and but the the again we're gonna have to employ the Lionel terminology here the old mainstream moving put it that way legacy media they really just go after that guy in NBC and the New York Times I have I have this strong feeling they never watched one of his videos okay seriously but I mean I'm Robin getting into this ideological bent here I mean because someone like Jordan Peterson is really going against the the current that's in the new or the old mainstream media and they really go after him I don't know if you know what I'm talking about go ahead Rob well what one of the things that that I find really questionable with even a big paper like the New York Times is and and I look at this is probably budgetary budgetary problem is do they have the money to do fact-checking anymore or do they not care I've written to The Times about some erroneous stories that they've had where it just seems to me nobody does due diligence anymore when I wrote for time incorporated for their various books if I when I wrote something I had it an editor a researcher calling me asking me okay tell me what you have in your notes and if it wasn't sufficient it wasn't going in the story and and now we seem to write more about our feelings than we do about our facts okay let me go to line all that last 40 seconds a lot of journalists so-called journalists write about their mistakes later okay go ahead Lionel forty seconds before we go to the break perfect example this recently there was a study about the president allegedly calling allegedly calling immigrants or dreamers animals when in fact he referred to ms-13 now because the me the media today this this archaic ossified media is a runaway train that you have to feed constantly by virtue of the fact that you can correct yourself that breaking news can be correctly they jumped with this idea that he referred to immigrants as being animals now before anybody knew it it immediately repeated replicated and then later on with the idea that well we can correct it later on when you had a deadline when somebody had to yell stop the presses it meant something and this Rob says there is no fact Jesse okay it was AP the AP was the first to admit that they had made a mistake gentlemen I'm gonna go to a break here after that short break we'll continue more discussion on media were stay with our team welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on peter Lavelle's remind you were discussing media wars okay let's go back to Ron in Los Angeles I'm like many other people could be very critical on how President Trump handles himself for the rhetorically how he deals with the press I think all that's fair game most importantly it should be about policy but it seems to me that the the the legacy media the cable stations again with the exception of Fox to some extent they're actually imitating him if he can break all the rules then why can't we but at the end of the day the media loses because you know Trump isn't held he doesn't say I'm a man of virtue I'm he's not a man of great values okay the American people that voted for him didn't vote for a choirboy but it seems to me that the the legacy media they feel that they have the right to imitate Donald Trump and I think that is a huge disservice to the public go ahead run it is a huge disservice to the public yes however I would offer the alternative I don't think the media is losing I I think the American people are losing sure I think that I think that the media at the end of the day really likes Trump they appreciate the fact that he gives them clickbait that he gives them these sound bites you know because he doesn't talk very diplomatically and it kind of helped him get elected in the first place so they run with these little tidbits and you know it's not just the media working alone I would argue that the politicians really help out especially because the Democratic Party they have really no platform and they have no ideas so all they can really do is say hey we're not Trump and Trump's really bad and here's another soundbite and it's very very frustrating especially as somebody on the Left so what I like to do is when people were complaining about the the latest for instance with the the animals statement I would we retweet them all and I'd be like you know what if you were tired you wouldn't have to listen to them anymore just a suggestion yeah really good point you know Rob it seems like it's just virtues SATA signaling that's what I get I get from the the the old mainstream media the legacy media it's really just you know who's virtuous and oh of course the president the United States has no virtues so the rest of us have it I didn't think that's what journalism was supposed to be about okay and I think that's one of the things that is really pulling everything down I mean there's so many important issues here of you know the economy is booming I don't really think it's booming its booming for the for the wealthy and for the finnick financially well-to-do and when there needs to be much more of my microscope on that and also the the animals issue a my immigration has to be talked about in a civil way it's something that everyone wants but no it's virtue signaling you know let's look after the caravan in Mexico okay I for me this is this is a dead end and I've they're playing they're doing a complete disservice to the public go ahead Bob well it's incumbent upon the President and his White House to function the way it's supposed to I don't believe we even have a new communications director I understand how the White House works and a communications director is supposed to liaised with the other people on the comms team at the White House who then in turn work with their press counterparts in the press pool I don't think anything goes on there in terms of the White House conveying the White House and the president's policies and so there and you have something there's just a stagnation and an inertia so the press pool sits around twiddling their thumbs going what are we going to do today and but don't you think Rob that a lot of people are in the press pool there they they they don't really want they don't see this White House is being legitimate I mean they don't they don't talk to their their their counterparts in the White House as equals because they they look down upon them okay I mean you exceed in their faces at the White House press gatherings you can see the contempt that they have okay okay Lionel you're laughing but I think it's really true I mean they are virtuous okay that's but that's not what politics is really all about and that's what and and that's not what people voted for go ahead like if you know if I could this may be rather self-aggrandizing in a weird way but let me just what we're doing right now first of all the amount of time than any of us have had to discuss an idea could not exist in the old mainstream media could not by virtue of time number two there are no advertisers here so there's nobody limiting what we say number three none of us gets any kind of a list from the producer ahead of time to try to ferret out ferret exactly what we're going to say to limit what we're going to say to contain the message this is with all that's going on with Russian media and foreign agents the most free form and I know it sounds like a being gratuitous but if the old mainstream media tried that if somebody if any of the particulars hacks you want to mention it said you know what today we're gonna try something I'm gonna have somebody who's really good perhaps combative and I'm not gonna tow the party line but I'm gonna really provide a chance for people to come forward and not exclude them through filtration it might help but they can't because they are Hollywood and Entertainment has become almost the entertainment section of the military-industrial complex the deep state depending on whatever you want to call it this is an agenda and now with Obama going to Netflix signing a development deal do you have any idea what that means this is apparatchik agitprop nonsense and people see through it and they're gonna repel they don't understand they've lost the war the older times are done with and people are gonna rebuild okay but you know let's be fair here I mean a program no no no I will be Jaime anytime I'm very critical of like CNN and MSNBC but Ron let's talk you know your progressive let's talk about Fox here I mean I like Tucker Carlson very much I'm very open about that but then I watch Hannity and I just think that's just you know the White House that's a White House press operation I mean they'd say it's transparently an extension of the White House and I think that that is not journalism I know Sean Hannity is a partisan person and he wears his stripes on his on his sleeves there but at the same time you get that you get to have a lien there's real collusion there what do you think Ron well I think hyper partisanship and kind of like that type of pundit tree is just a quick paycheck and it's always kind of been in style who's the number one host right now Rachel Maddow Rachel Maddow is just the the corporate left I mean because she's not left at all but but she's kind of the corporate media version of the left response to a Sean Hannity Sean Hannity was number one when Obama was in office well she's number one now because Trump's in office it's giving people the these tribal little groups to get into and that's how we go about our business and I would also say you know the White House is in total disarray yes that's true there's more turnover than a third party pyramid scheme let yes that's true however the media is no better at all I mean when the media was told to turn off their cameras there was not one person in that room in that press briefing room that had the courage to say no I'm not turning off my camera because this is my job my employer is very powerful and I'm not turning my camera off what are you gonna do arrest me that story will go viral go ahead they all said yes sir madam I'll turn my camera off that's not journalism that's access journalism that sink offense it's nonsense and it's garbage and it's got to stop but full disclaimer here I am going to be submitting a pilot to Barack Obama's netflix company because I am in show business and with them I don't have to worry about them changing anything okay well I'll sign me up if you get the gig okay I'll certainly watch it there you know Rob you know I've often thought of looking at the the White House briefings is that these people have already written their article and they're just looking for a soundbite to throw in there they're really stenographers they're stenographers for the powers that be and again you know when I look at the quality and the aptitude of the questions that are being asked I just wonder Oh is this just you know is this for what was it do we had the classes for people that there was a Advanced Placement for smart people and then what was the other classes for the slow people I don't remember the term right now but I mean it's these people are challenged intellectually they I mean they really are challenged intellectually and if you ask a bad question you're gonna get a bad answer hasn't anyone figured that out yet go ahead rob one of the things that I find really idiotic that nobody is consistently calling out is watch a press conference with Sarah Huckabee Sanders I'm not a fan of hers but a reporter will raise their hand and say so isn't it true that President Trump is lying about blah blah blah blah he's gonna say no and then they go oh my god she's lying Joe what are they expect her to say somehow you've compelled me to admit that my boss is deceiving you the American people the whole world God and everybody else in every universe it's it's like it's like the idiotic sportscaster that's like did you feel bad when you struck out and lost the World Series I'm going to Disney World okay line on one of the things that we rapidly running out of time and I want to make sure you have plenty of time to finish up but one of the things they Trump lives you know you know well personal politicians lie all the time and my sense is and it's not to defend the president because he said things that I'm very strongly disagree with but it you know saying something saying something that somebody disagrees with doesn't mean it's a lie and I don't understand this Trobe that people are constantly going after that because if you use that level of analysis then I'm right than the mains and the mainstream media although the networks that they're lying all the time as well so if it's the same standard go ahead idle well that's like going to a spelling bee and somebody gets it wrong and you say you're lying is happening right now this is the marker right now what you're doing is when somebody goes back what a Jake Tapper comes back and asks up as Ron says perhaps the most stupid question in the history of mankind they don't say hey Jake that was the most stupid question in the history of mankind they said do you see how many likes you got this is Richard this has gone viral but it's stupid no such thing is stupid our numbers are up because that's what it is this is a what they do is what something that they can refer to later because what's happened is they don't realize it they are a track this is beyond CTE this is like telepathy they're living in the past and they don't know it the star has burned out millions of years ago they're the last ones to be told okay Lian I'm gonna give you the last 10 seconds cuz you're so eloquent give us a word we need to look up in the thesaurus go ahead the best one is Mockingbird media and Mockingbird media my first operation Mockingbird and it refers to what is still in effect in effect an attempt by the CIA to basically to have repeaters as you alluded to and not reporters that simple and that's much tagged rocky heaters we're gonna end on that note ripp Peters here we're not repeaters on crosstalk many thanks to my guests in New York and in Los Angeles and thanks to our viewers for view watching us here at RT see you next time and remember traffic rules you
