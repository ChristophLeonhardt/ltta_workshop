<font color="#E5E5E5">really impressed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dialogue I watch</font>

80
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,900
a lot of American television shows it's

81
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,370
a very different use of language than

82
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,920
the dialogue that I'm sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of more used</font>

83
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,170
to it was weird not to have music and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

84
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,520
really notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at first I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

85
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,410
noticed the silences<font color="#E5E5E5"> where normally</font>

86
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:43,790
there would be some kind of score or

87
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,769
underlying musical transition music

88
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,959
that's some stuff apart from like the

89
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:50,540
big thematic you know opening and

90
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,850
closing music there isn't really any use

91
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,620
of music that I notice whatsoever you do

92
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">slowly key in the story</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lies together</font>

93
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,550
and they do suggest at the past story

94
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,930
but you don't feel like you're missing

95
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,700
this huge part of the history I think

96
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">was any other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my sister the one who's</font>
