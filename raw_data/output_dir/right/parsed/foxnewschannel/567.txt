TRANSPARENCY PROBLEM AS I DID
EVEN UNDER ERIC HOLDER AND
LORETTA LYNCH AND THAT IS SAYING
LORETTA LYNCH AND THAT IS SAYING
SOMETHING.
HERE TO EXPLAIN WHAT ALL OF THAT
HERE TO EXPLAIN WHAT ALL OF THAT
MEANS, IS CONGRESSMAN MARK
MEADOWS, CHAIR OF THE HOUSE
FREEDOM CAUCUS, HERE EXCLUSIVELY
FREEDOM CAUCUS, HERE EXCLUSIVELY
WITH US TONIGHT.
CONGRESSMAN, I HAVE BEEN DYING
TO TALK TO YOU.
THIS WAS A WILD DAY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE
OVERHYPED.
THEY HAD THE CAMERA ON THE CAR.
I WAS LIKE HIM AS HE CRAWLING TO
I WAS LIKE HIM AS HE CRAWLING TO
THE WHITE HOUSE?
IT IS ONLY SIX BLOCKS.
IT TOOK AN HOUR FOR HIM TO GET
OVER THERE.
IT BECOME A BIG DRAMA.
ENDED UP NOTHING.
WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS ENDS UP
ON THURSDAY?
WHERE SHOULD IT END UP?
IS IT A TRAP TO FIRE ROSENSTEIN
NOW OR WHERE IS YOUR HEAD AT
HERE?
>> LAURA, I DON’T KNOW THAT IT’S
>> LAURA, I DON’T KNOW THAT IT’S
A TRAP.
REALLY, WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS
REALLY, WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS
THAT ROD NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT
THAT ROD NEEDS TO BE TRANSPARENT
WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
THERE WAS NO PLAN TO FIRE HIM
THIS MORNING.
I KNOW THERE WAS ALL KINDS OF
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT WERE
OUT THERE BUT QUITE FRANKLY, IT
WAS MORE A RESIGNATION QUESTION
THEN A FIRING QUESTION TODAY.
YET OBVIOUSLY, ALL OF THAT
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’T
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’TH
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’TN
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’TE
CHANGED.
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’T.
HERE IS WHAT IS IT       DIDN’T.
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFERENT
NARRATIVES COME OUT OF THE DOJ.
IF INDEED ROD ROSENSTEIN SAID
THESE THINGS, WHICH MANY BELIEVE
THAT HE DID, MANY BELIEVE THAT
HE SAID IT IN A NONJOKING
MANNER, THEN HE NEEDS TO EXPLAIN
MANNER, THEN HE NEEDS TO EXPLAIN
THAT, NOT ONLY TO THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
BOTH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
WE ARE PUSHING VERY HARD TO MAKE
WE ARE PUSHING VERY HARD TO MAKE
SURE THAT HE COMES IN UNDER OATH
SURE THAT HE COMES IN UNDER OATH
TO CONGRESS AND LET THE AMERICAN
TO CONGRESS AND LET THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES.
I CAN’T TELL YOU THAT IF HE DOES
I CAN’T TELL YOU THAT IF HE DOES
NOT, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF US
THAT ARE STANDING BY REALLY WITH
THAT ARE STANDING BY REALLY WITH
IMPEACHMENT DOCUMENTS, THAT
SAID, WE CANNOT HAVE THIS KIND
OF ACTIVITY CONTINUE AT DOJ.
>> Laura: I DON’T GET THE
JOKE.
SAYING IT JOKINGLY?
I THINK SOMEONE WHO HAS THAT
LEVEL OF POOR JUDGMENT, TO JOKE
ABOUT THE 25TH AMENDMENT OR
WEARING A WIRE ON THE PRESIDENT,
WEARING A WIRE ON THE PRESIDENT,
NUMBER ONE, IT’S NOT FUNNY, TWO,
NUMBER ONE, IT’S NOT FUNNY, TWO,
NOT SOMETHING YOU TALK ABOUT.
EITHER HE HAS A REALLY BIZARRE
SENSE OF HUMOR OR HE SAID IT WAS
SERIOUS.
I DON’T BUY THAT IT WAS A HUGE
SET UP FOR TRUMP.
>>  TOTAL NIGHTMARE FOR DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL.
HE MELTED AND WET HIS PANTS UP
THE FIRST SECOND THE SENATE
ASKED HIM TO ANSWER SOME
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RUSSIA
INVESTIGATION.
THE WHOLE THING WAS -- I’M
SORRY.
I THINK IS ONE OF THE WORST
APPOINTMENTS EVER.
JAY SEKULOW, I WANT TO GET YOUR
RESPONSE ON THE OTHER SIDE.
THIS IS WHAT HE SAID.
>> IF, IN FACT, ROD ROSENSTEIN
DOES END UP RESIGNING COME I
THINK IT’S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT
THERE WOULD BE A STEP BACK TAKEN
THERE WOULD BE A STEP BACK TAKEN
HERE.
A REVIEW.
I THINK IT’S A REVIEW THAT HAS
TO BE THOROUGH AND COMPLETE, AND
TO BE THOROUGH AND COMPLETE, AND
A REVIEW THAT HAS TO INCLUDE AN
INVESTIGATION OF WHAT HAS
TRANSPIRED WITH ALL OF THESE
STATEMENTS AND ALL OF THESE
ALLEGATIONS, GOING BACK TO THE
PETER STRZOK AND LISA PAGE AND
BRUCE OHR AND BASICALLY A
TIMEOUT ON ON US AND COREY.
>> Laura: WROTE ABOUT THAT?
A TIMEOUT ON THE MUELLER PROBE?
IS THAT REALISTIC?
>> I DON’T KNOW THAT IT’S
REALISTIC BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT
THERE SHOULD BE A TIMEOUT AND
ACCOUNTABILITY.
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE PRIME
EXAMPLE, LAURA.
WE’VE GOT A DOUBLE STANDARD.
HE GOT A COUPLE OF PEOPLE THAT
WORK IN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN
THAT ARE REALLY BEING PROSECUTED
THAT ARE REALLY BEING PROSECUTED
FOR LYING TO THE FBI.
AND YET WE KNOW THAT FALSE
TESTIMONY WAS GIVEN TO BRUCE OHR
TESTIMONY WAS GIVEN TO BRUCE OHR
BY EITHER FUSION GPS OR
CHRISTOPHER STEELE.
WE KNOW THAT INDEED THEY
MENTIONED A PERSON BY THE NAME
OF CLAYTON MITCHELL AND HIS
WHOLE NARRATIVE, THE NRA,
ACTUALLY BEING INVOLVED IN A
RUSSIA COLLUSION, THEY ACTUALLY
SHARED THAT WITH A DOJ OFFICIAL,
SHARED THAT WITH A DOJ OFFICIAL,
AND YET THERE ARE NO PROSECUTION
AND YET THERE ARE NO PROSECUTION
THAT’S BEING DONE THERE.
IT WAS FALSE TESTIMONY, GIVEN TO
IT WAS FALSE TESTIMONY, GIVEN TO
A DOJ PERSON.
WE’VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THERE IS
ONE STANDARD FOR EVERYBODY, AND
I CAN TELL YOU THAT ROD
ROSENSTEIN IS NOT IMPLEMENTING
THAT, AND IT’S TIME THAT WE HOLD
THAT, AND IT’S TIME THAT WE HOLD
HIM ACCOUNTABLE.
>> Laura: CONGRESSMAN, REAL
QUICK, WHY IS IT THAT THE
PRESIDENT DECIDED TO GO BACK ON
HIS DECISION TO DECLASSIFY THOSE
HIS DECISION TO DECLASSIFY THOSE
DOCUMENTS AND KICK IT OVER TO
THE IG?
I STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND THAT.
I UNDERSTAND ROSENSTEIN WAS THE
ONE WHO BROUGHT THE MESSAGE TO
HIM.
THE PRESIDENT A SEATED TO HIS
WISHES.
WHY?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
TRYING TO BE CAUTIOUS TO MAKE
SURE THAT SOURCES AND METHODS
ARE NOT OUT THERE.
I CAN TELL YOU, I TALKED TO THE
IG TODAY, THE BRUCE OHR 302s,
THERE IS NO REASON --
>> Laura: DOES HAVE TO BE
RELEASED.
>> TWO PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE,
THEY DON’T HAVE SECURITY
