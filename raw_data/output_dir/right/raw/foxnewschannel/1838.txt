1
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:11,561
>> Laura: YOU JUST KNEW THE

2
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:14,998
MEDIA WOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME

3
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:16,433
ACKNOWLEDGING ANOTHER TRUMP

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:16,766
TRIUMPH.

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,468
THEY FOUND A WAY TO CRITICIZE

6
00:00:18,468 --> 00:00:21,271
THE PRESIDENT AS HE GREETED

7
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,175
THREE AMERICAN HOSTAGES RELEASED

8
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:26,610
FROM NORTH KOREA.

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,814
>> YOU HAVE THREE PRISONERS OF

10
00:00:30,814 --> 00:00:33,083
THE NORTH KOREAN SLAVE STATE,

11
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:33,984
IT'S ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, ABOUT

12
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:35,318
THE RATINGS.

13
00:00:35,318 --> 00:00:37,821
>> HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE

14
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:41,825
THESE IMAGES ARE TURNED AROUND.

15
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:44,227
>> DONALD TRUMP IS A FORMER

16
00:00:44,227 --> 00:00:45,562
REALITY PRODUCER.

17
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:47,564
THIS WAS A STAGED PRODUCTION

18
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,065
MEANT FOR TELEVISION, MEANT FOR

19
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:51,368
THE CAMERAS.

20
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:53,036
>> Laura: MAYBE SHE'S HAVING

21
00:00:53,036 --> 00:00:53,370
AMNESIA.

22
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,407
JUST FOUR YEARS AGO PRESIDENT

23
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:02,345
OBAMA STAGED A PHOTO OP

24
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:07,951
ANNOUNCING THE ARMY.

25
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:11,588
OBAMA TRADED FIVE TERRORISTS WHO

26
00:01:11,588 --> 00:01:23,533
PLED GUILTY TO DESERTION.

27
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:25,669
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, OBAMA,

28
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,904
WHEN HE WAS NOMINATED, HE WENT

29
00:01:27,904 --> 00:01:32,008
TO THAT INVESCO FIELD SPEECH IN

30
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,342
DENVER.

31
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:37,314
THEY BROUGHT IN THE ROMAN

32
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:37,647
COLUMNS.

33
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,649
HE WAS GOOD AT STAGE PRODUCTION.

34
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:41,818
HERE WE HAVE TRUMP AT 3:00 IN

35
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:45,589
THE MORNING GOING TO GREET THE

36
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:47,023
HOSTAGES AND EVERYBODY IS HAVING

37
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,425
A MELTDOWN.

38
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:53,196
>> THE PRESIDENT WENT OUT TO

39
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,232
GIVE THEM A HERO'S WELCOME.

40
00:01:56,232 --> 00:02:00,170
SOME HAVE TO MINIMIZE IT.

41
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,305
IT BECOMES ANOTHER ANTI-TRUMP

42
00:02:02,305 --> 00:02:02,706
STORY.

43
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,908
HE DIDN'T SHOW ENOUGH EMPATHY,

44
00:02:04,908 --> 00:02:07,510
HE DIDN'T BITE HIS LOWER LIP AND

45
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,411
FEEL THEIR PAIN.

46
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:11,948
SAME THING WHEN HE WENT TO VISIT

47
00:02:11,948 --> 00:02:15,619
THE HURRICANE VICTIMS.

48
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:17,687
>> Laura: LESLIE, HERE'S A

49
00:02:17,687 --> 00:02:19,723
YAHOO! HEADLINE.

50
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:23,193
TRUMP CHEAPENS NORTH KOREA

51
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:23,994
HOSTAGE RETURN.

52
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:26,529
HE MADE AN OFF-HAND COMMENT

53
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:29,032
ABOUT WE'LL GET RATINGS AT 3 IN

54
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,133
THE MORNING.

55
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,067
THAT'S TRUMP.

56
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,003
HE'S NOT MAKING IT ABOUT HIMSELF

57
00:02:33,003 --> 00:02:33,870
GETTING RATINGS.

58
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,173
THIS COMPARED TO BILL CLINTON IN

59
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:39,209
2009, HERE'S HEADLINES, RELEASE

60
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,845
OF JOURNALISTS, BOTH CLINTONS

61
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,847
HAD KEY ROLES.

62
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:46,549
BILL CLINTON AND JOURNALISTS,

63
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:49,552
EMOTIONAL RETURN TO THE U.S.,

64
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:50,920
AUGUST 5, 2009 WHEN HE GOT

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,188
PRISONERS RELEASED FROM NORTH

66
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:52,489
KOREA.

67
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:53,857
THE DOUBLE STANDARD, WHETHER YOU

68
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:56,493
ARE A REPUBLICAN OR DIPLOMAT,

69
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:57,961
HAVE SOME FAIRNESS.

70
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:00,163
>> I HAVE TO SAY, I AM A

71
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:02,365
DEMOCRAT WHO LOVES TO ATTACK THE

72
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:04,334
PRESIDENT EVERY CHANCE I GET.

73
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:06,870
BUT THIS ONE SHOULD BE ABOUT

74
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,638
THESE THREE MEN RELEASED, IT

75
00:03:08,638 --> 00:03:11,241
SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT POLITICS.

76
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:14,911
I DIDN'T THINK AND I KNOW

77
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:19,049
LEFTIES GET MAD AT ME, I DIDN'T

78
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:20,316
THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE

79
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:20,917
PRESIDENT.

80
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:23,586
WHAT BOTHERED ME WHEN HE GAVE

81
00:03:23,586 --> 00:03:24,454
CREDIT TO KIM JONG UN.

82
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,089
THESE MEN WERE IMPRISONED, THEY

83
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,391
WERE IN THE DARK, THEY WERE NOT

84
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:30,593
ALLOWED TO GO OUTSIDE, NOT GIVEN

85
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:33,029
PROPER FOOD OR WATER OR MEDICAL

86
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:33,396
ATTENTION.

87
00:03:33,396 --> 00:03:35,598
THAT WAS THE THING THAT BOTHERED

88
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:37,167
ME THE MOMENT AND THE COMMENTS

89
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,102
ABOUT THE RATINGS.

90
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,170
IT IS TRUMP.

91
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,573
WE HOPE DAY AFTER DAY, HE WILL

92
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:45,408
BECOME MORE PRESIDENTIAL AND

93
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,444
FORGET THE SIZE OF CLOUD.

94
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:50,714
>> THERE IS A LITTLE

95
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:51,147
INCONSISTENCY.

96
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,549
WHEN HE WAS ATTACKING LITTLE

97
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:55,585
ROCKET MAN, HE WAS DENOUNCED AS

98
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:56,019
CRAZY.

99
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:57,954
YES, HE'S SAYING THINGS ABOUT

100
00:03:57,954 --> 00:03:59,222
HIM BECAUSE HE'S GOING TO MEET

101
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:02,258
HIM AND TRY TO NEGOTIATE AND TRY

102
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:06,196
TO NEGOTIATE A NUCLEAR

103
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:06,596
DISARMAMENT.

104
00:04:06,596 --> 00:04:10,033
A LOT OF THINGS HE DOES IS

105
00:04:10,033 --> 00:04:10,834
CONTROVERSIAL.

106
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:15,672
BRINGING HOME AMERICAN HOSTAGES,

107
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,707
THAT'S NOT CONTROVERSIAL.

108
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:20,543
>> Laura: NOBODY THINKS THE

109
00:04:20,543 --> 00:04:21,511
PRESIDENT BELIEVES KIM JONG UN

110
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,879
IS A NICE GUY.

111
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,815
HE SAYS CHUCK SCHUMER AND I ARE

112
00:04:25,815 --> 00:04:30,120
PAULS.

113
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,420
PALS.

114
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,721
THIS IS PART OF THE ART OF THE

115
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,021
DEAL.

116
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,424
HE KNOWS WHEN HE GOES TO

117
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:36,659
SINGAPORE ON JUNE 12, THIS IS A

118
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,162
DICEY DEAL, NO ONE TRUSTS THEM,

119
00:04:39,162 --> 00:04:42,599
WE HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF

120
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:44,100
THEM GOING BACK ON THEIR

121
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,534
AGREEMENTS.

122
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,003
HE GOES IN WITH EYES WIDE OPEN.

123
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,338
I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY

124
00:04:48,338 --> 00:04:49,739
IMPORTANT FOR ALL THE AMERICANS

125
00:04:49,739 --> 00:04:51,808
WHO ARE WATCHING THE SHOW

126
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,877
TONIGHT TO REMEMBER HOW THE

127
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:55,278
PRESS TREAT DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY

128
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:57,180
HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THE

129
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,082
COUNTRY VERSUS HOW THEY TREAT

130
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:00,784
THIS PRESIDENT, HE'S HAD

131
00:05:00,784 --> 00:05:02,385
MULTIPLE SUCCESSES AND THE

132
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,621
COVERAGE IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR

133
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:04,988
BALANCED.

134
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,990
BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, DO YOU

135
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,658
THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE

136
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:10,093
TUNING OUT A LOT OF THIS GIVEN

137
00:05:10,093 --> 00:05:12,962
THAT THE NUMBERS ARE GOING UP

138
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:13,963
FOR TRUMP?

139
00:05:13,963 --> 00:05:15,198
>> WHAT.

140
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:18,968
>> Laura: THE BIAS, TREATING THE

141
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:20,770
PRESS LIKE THEY ARE IRRELEVANT.

142
00:05:20,770 --> 00:00:00,000
>> THEY HAVE CONCLUDED THIS
