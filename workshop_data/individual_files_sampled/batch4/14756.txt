in a world of digital social media digital supermarkets digital movies and media it should be no surprise that even art is being digitized even modeling digital video and image production is getting so good that we can produce authentic looking human images from pixels alone and that is what's happening one of the newest supermodels to hit the industry is Xu Zhu a twenty-something year old South African model with a symmetrical face and great hips but she isn't real she's completely digital she was created by a Cameron James Wilson a photographer in London who claims she is the first-ever digital supermodel she's made of CGI modeling and is used as a model on his Instagram and she could be the beginning of the trend the traditional photo shoot might well come to an end as models are created according to the eye and the desire of the photographer no more fiddling with lighting and finding the perfect location and space and spending all that money on all that equipment in space the industry could be transformed within a matter of years the same is true in art fine arts a painting has been created by artificial intelligence and is expected to sell for up to ten thousand dollars in an auction later this year the work is a portrait of Edmund D Bellamy a fictional character and was created using a generative adversarial network to create a piece that looks like it was made by a human it's kind of creepy isn't it there are other AI artists as well producing surrealist and abstract pieces but what I think is even more bizarre than this artwork is that robots and AI are doing way more than we thought we used to predict that computers would one day work around our homes performing physical and manual tasks like washing the dishes but it hasn't turned out that way at all in fact robots and AI have become our competition they're manipulating the world around them through software not through robotic hands and they're eating into human industries and arts I mean who would have ever predicted AI models and art what happened to the flying cars to the personal robot Butler I'm not really sure I like the way this is going jobs will be lost and industries transformed forever and the change is speeding up never before have we seen whole industries change this quickly and I suspect in a few short years the fashion modeling in our industries will have changed for good I mean how does this affect the industry and what does it mean futurism is going beyond what we thought who would have thought about AI models and art we thought we would have flying cars and they focus on automated factory workers but it turns out the future of AI is art and modeling if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
