Nationality feels so powerful.
We fight for our country.
We cheer for it.
We draw our values from it.
It’s a big way many of
us describe who we are,
but it didn’t used to be.
Up until really recently, our
identities came from stuff
immediately around us —
clans, religion, family.
If you think about
it, nationality
is weird, the idea
that you identify
with millions of strangers
just based on borders.
That’s because national
identity is made up.
“U.S.A.!
U.S.A.!”
“And then  scores!”
National identity is the myth
that built the modern world,
but it also primes us for
dictatorship, racism, genocide.
And today, we’re fighting
over whether to keep
that kind of national identity.
To understand why, you have
to see how new this idea is.
So you think you
know what France is.
It’s a place united
by the French language
and the French ethnicity, right?
But as of the French
Revolution, half of the people
there could not speak French.
Only one in eight spoke it well.
These are the languages
that people spoke,
just a patchwork that
didn’t line up with borders.
We know from modern genetics
that ethnicity didn’t line up
with borders, either.
National identity
became the idea
that language, race, and borders
should add up to a country.
Nations can’t admit
they’re made up,
so they invent a
national mythology
that says they’ve been
like this forever.
The modern era brought
four big changes
that led to national identity.
People moved in big numbers
from the country to the city,
and they needed a
common language.
New technology, like
newspapers and trains,
made countries feel smaller
and more interconnected.
War was changing into this
vast all-consuming thing.
Countries needed
people that cared
so much about 
their nation,
they’d fight for it 
in huge numbers.
Governments were challenging
religion for power.
Here’s Napoleon taking
his crown from the pope
to crown himself emperor.
It was a big deal.
These four things sparked an
era of revolutions in democracy,
but they also unleashed ideas
of nationalism, militarism,
and leader worship.
People came to see
their countries
as extensions of themselves.
This new identity meant that
a nation got its authority,
not from the government,
or the King, or God,
but from the people.
This changed the world, but
it also changed how we think.
National identity
changes our reality.
We experience whatever
happens to our nation
as if it happened to us.
“Rocky IV” can tell us a lot
about what national identity
does to our brains.
“The Russian towers
above the American.”
A 1994 study tested the
attitudes of Americans
watching the movie.
It includes an amazing footnote.
All 216 participants were
women because, quote,
“There were no males who
had not seen ‘Rocky IV.’”
Anyway —
When Rocky beat his
Russian opponent,
participants who strongly
identified as American
felt a boost in self-esteem.
When they were shown
re-edited footage
to make it look like Rocky lost,
they felt a drop in self-esteem
and they became likelier to hold
negative views about Russians.
But when they said something
bad about Russians,
their self-esteem recovered.
When we feel
threatened, it makes
us want to humiliate and
dominate the outsider.
That dynamic doesn’t just
apply to individuals.
It can apply to whole societies.
This can drive war, itself.
One study found that
any country whose team
plays in the World
Cup becomes likelier
to launch attacks abroad.
That hostility also plays out
against minorities and migrants
who don’t fit the national myth.
It only took a century for these
problems of modern nationalism
to culminate into World War II, 
something so terrible,
it convinced the world to try a
new kind of national identity.
(SINGING) “Great American
melting pot.”
This model of identity is based
on an idea from the United
States.
Anyone can be American
if you share values
like freedom and hard work.
“May I please remind you
that it does not say
RSVP on the Statue of Liberty.”
It’s a stirring idea, but
it never completely worked.
“Your race is your nation.”
“If you don’t speak English
and don’t contribute, get out!”
The belief that being
American is really
about race, religion,
and language
also runs throughout history.
So what makes a country?
Which identity should matter?
That fight defines so much
of the world right now.
And it’s intensified.
You see it in the backlash
to the European Union.
“We’ve got our country back.”
You see it in how Donald
Trump began his campaign.
“We either have a
country or we don’t,
and it’s that simple.”
The national myth is powerful.
We fight for a common
past and a common future.
It isn’t real, but
that doesn’t matter.
We’ve been taught for so
long that this is who we are.
Building a world
based on shared values
really means
creating a new myth.
But that only works if it feels
as powerful as the last one.
