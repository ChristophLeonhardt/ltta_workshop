“They say that the movement
won’t work in Kansas.
They say, ‘Don’t go to Kansas,
they won’t accept you there.
They won't share
your values there,
that you won’t have
common ground with anyone.’
We all know that that is not true.”
Welcome to Wichita,
home of Koch Industries,
as in billionaire
Republican megadonors
Charles and David Koch.
This district hasn’t sent
a Democrat to Congress
in over 20 years.
Trump won the general election
in Kansas by a landslide.
But the left has an
interesting story here.
Bernie Sanders got
twice as many votes
as Hillary Clinton
in the primary.
Sanders’s message of
universal health care
and affordable education
resonates with Kansans.
“I’m a single father.
My occupation right
now is construction.
I do a lot of remodeling.
I’m a huge supporter
of Bernie.
And I think it’s awesome that
Alexandria, you know,
won the election there.”
Thousands here
recently lined up
to see rising Democratic star
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
and Senator Sanders.
The pair came to
Kansas to rally
for progressive Democrat
House candidates.
Leftists are hoping that
Ocasio-Cortez’s stunning win
in New York’s 14th District
can serve as a model
even in red states.
“The people support the ideas
that James is campaigning on.
All right?
It’s just a question of
bringing them to the polls.
If James wins here,
this will be not only another
progressive member
to the Congress,
this’ll be a shot heard around —
not just this country —
the world.
“I’m excited and humbled
to be here.”
“Happy people.”
“Because I’m a teacher
and have concerns
about funding,
not only in my classroom,
but just across districts,
I felt it was important to come.
I work in a population that
is very impoverished.
During the winter you 
would see our kids
coming to school in blankets.”
“I’m so happy to introduce
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.”
“This is the defining moment,
not just for the state of Kansas,
but for this nation.”
“The thing is is that there are
a lot of working families here.
There’s a lot of
blue collar here.
And I think the reason that
Trump won resoundingly here
was because of that.”
“It was very empowering
to hear her speak.
She comes from the Bronx.
I grew up in one of the poorest
zip codes in Wichita,
so it’s very moving
to be here today
because it hits home.”
“You all are very lucky,
and very blessed
to have James Thompson
as a candidate.
To have a man that so truly
cares for the needs
of working-class people
and fights for the
dignity of his neighbors.
You’re very lucky.”
“Because I know what it’s like
to struggle to make ends meet.
What it’s like to have
to choose between,
you know, paying for food for
your kids or paying the rent.”
It’s a long shot for Thompson.
But even if he
comes close,
it will be further proof of
concept for progressives
who want to reimagine
the Democratic Party
and take back power
from Republicans.
“We must’ve gotten
off at the wrong stop
because people
told me that Kansas
was a Republican state.
Doesn't look like that today.”
