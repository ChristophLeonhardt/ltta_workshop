oh hello everyone how is everyone doing
Eddie Smasher selfie and today leizerman
we are back
finally with beyond two souls and you're
probably thinking Brandon what the hell
I thought this series is finished well I
decided to go back to it just this one
last time since you guys absolutely
loved the series like if you guys
haven't watched this series like the
support and it has been so amazing like
you guys really did love it so if you
haven't watched it I'm sure you are
going to love it
so this this video won't make any sense
unless you've watched the entire series
so there's no point you're watching it
if you have watch the series so
basically in this video I am going to
replay pretty much all the levels not
all of them most of the levels and show
like an alternative ending to each of
them because this game is all about the
choices and like your sort of
consequences between your choices and
yeah I'm going to show you in this video
the stuff that I could have done but I
didn't do in my actual series so it'll
be really exciting if you've watched the
entire series and you've wondered what
if I did this or if I pick that option
so um yeah okay so the first level we
are going to revisit is the party level
episode 2 where we got invited to the
party and we kissed this bloody boy okay
okay we are back with the party level
now there is so many things I didn't do
first time like you can get drunk okay
let's take the beer and bloody drink it
drink it Jodi I think I get drunk off
the one bit going slut that shit we're
getting bloody drunk gone slap it slap

see what happens oh shit Geordie blaze

four-eyes no ginger twat I would rather
give you look kind of scary like that oh
my god coming late whoa we can leave
shit we didn't do this before I didn't
thinking you're wondering why we're here
hmm thinking the same thing
whoa
I know you told me just wanted to see
what it would be like - oh I missed
friends oh I miss Jody so much this is
not what I expected
oh that's sad what if I mess up the
dancing ha ha ha
I guess dancing something is it ha ha ha

you guys insisted in writing okay guys
it's time to eat that delicious cake and
most current open mic we're just gonna
forget everything that happened are they
gonna still like mess with me and stop
because I was nice kidding me ah shit
okay well back in the cupboard I go
there's no point resisting it it's gonna
happen either way okay now I believe
there was another ending to this level
okay now what I did before as I trashed
up the place but you could potentially
burn down the place now I haven't done
this before so let's see if we can do it
okay open the door
go on Jodie oh yeah we have an option to
leave should I see what happens when we
just leave uh I guess I guess I haven't
done that before I think yeah I think
let's try let's do that let's just leave
Oh Jodie I guess that's the smart thing
to do
oh she just wanted to make friends it's
so me
Oh Jodi Jodi Jodi I guess that was it
okay uh let's let's burn down the house
this time okay
goiden oh I see okay so now I believe
once we wreck up the place
okay we can push this candle over and
apparently it burns down the house oh
shit that look brutal oh shit oh I do I
love doing this so much
yes candles oh shit
yes burn the place down
oh my god we're burning down the house
oh shit I'm are they dead let them out
no I want to kill him oh my god this is
Savage wait what if I don't let them out
are they gonna die
shit niggas go running only all made out
Oh mommy so Oh
let's go home Jesus Christ burning down
the house that's mad I kind of wish I
did that first time out
oh that was funny Jesus Christ that was
mattang fat
I said no end of story freeze me whoa
Jodie's look whoa I didn't know that so
if you left the party and didn't like
impress the kids all right you're no
longer an emo you're a bloody like
proper teenager okay so this was from
episode 3 okay and this is when we went
out and sneaked out of the lab okay and
went to the bar okay now some pretty
scary outcomes were to this you know
because we ended up killing the people
at the bar oh yeah I didn't do this last
time the guitar oh shit Jody you're
gonna rock out what what is it
Oh Jodie's miles Wow ready to go yeah
rocky Ben go
whoa that was badass Jody why might do
that the first time man that was sick
okay ladies Gemma now I thought
something weird would happen if I let
the thugs like attack me but apparently
that's just it they just go out the bar
and that's it so now what we're gonna do
is we're gonna get caught by the officer
or the guard at the front desk okay here
we go
what hello Cole Jody officer there late
four-day trip in it oh he's onto
something uh Dawkins well was Nathan's
idea some kind of like night training in
the d-wing huh I mean as if my days
weren't enough for his experiments funny
cuz you know I just spoke to Professor
Dawkins oh uh yeah he just called myself
and I don't know it's just like a sudden
flash of genius or something and so uh
he wants me to do this new experiment
she's a good lawyer man look uh well you
know them scientists they never stop
awkward what's up Cole can't get your
tongue okay here we go this is where we
fail okay um a Voight
Cole we should probably get going now oh
shit
something fishy's going on tonight uh oh
um bad mood he he's in a really bad mood

bloody hug
I'm sorry
Oh

Joanie's wanted to go out and be like
everyone else for once
ha ha ha man I love this game so much
this this is when the better the game
was the best like at the beginning I
think actually now I think it was good
all around I think it started to slack
during the ending to be honest oh man I
love that I love this game ok so that
was that ending and that that's when I
failed it ok so let's move on now we are
moving on to the dinner date level which
was I believe episode 5 of the let's
play it was when Ryan comes over for a
dinner ok so what I want to do now is I
want to use iDEN to mess up the date
because I didn't do that last time mmm
what should I wear ok we went with
