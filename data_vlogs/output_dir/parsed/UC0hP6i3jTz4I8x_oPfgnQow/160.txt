hey let's write this Bella so the other
day actually went to a bugger spot which
is amazing because it's the first time
to have it here in the Philippines and
of course I have to make a video about
it so I'll be doing a gas that is me
says I haven't really done in video like
this before so basically I'm just going
to show you guys how my hair and makeup
was done and obviously I didn't do my
own hair and makeup because you know I
don't know how so I went to the salon
for that and yeah I'll stop talking now
so let's just get started
so before anything else she just started
off by bow drying my hair then she
started parting my hair so that don't be
easier for her to curl my hair
to make my face makeup go on smoother
and last longer if you will be applying
this valve and face primer to my face to
brighten up my complexion you'll be
using the CC cream from the face shop
okay it may look too light for my skin
right now but in person it actually
looks natural to set that all NGO using
this powder from again the base drop
using the Naked 2 palette you'll be
applying eye shadow to my eyelids to add
more depth and dimension to my eyes
of course my eyebrows need to be on
plate so she did my eyebrows
since my eyebrows are now on point it's
not time to curl my eyelashes using my
Shu Uemura eyelash curler Gen hunts my
eyelashes she will be applying false
lashes to my eyelashes while waiting for
the eyelash glue to dry she applied this
cheek color to my cheeks
since the eyelash glue was dry I decided
to open my eyes and this happened like
Oh what to complete my eye makeup hook
she'll be applying this Brauhaus mascara
to of course my eyelashes of course
we're gonna forget about the lips so she
applied this liquid lipstick to my lips
then she sprayed setting spray to my
face so that my makeup will last long as
you guys can see my curls are too crazy
so it is time to loosen up my curls
so here are some clips from the event
you are sweet as a honey they I just
can't believe you're nine
you stuck when I lost my head Oh your
love is so designed sometimes I need
space get lost in so I'm in the rescue
right now but if I just gonna start in a
few it's I don't have a watch but it's
