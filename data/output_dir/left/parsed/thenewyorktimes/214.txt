"There is Kanye West."
"I don't know if he wanted 
this type of attention."
"He's at the center of a hashtag."
Kanye West made
what might have been
his most controversial
statement to date
during an interview with TMZ.
“When you hear about slavery for 400 years
— for 400 years?
That sounds like a choice.”
But historians reject this argument.
Here’s why.
Kanye's idea is rooted in misconceptions
about slaves being complacent.
It also ignores the
history of slave resistance.
“The enslaved Africans
resisted persistently
in a number of different ways.
Whether not working as hard as they could
to something as widespread
as a slave revolt.
And so the biggest
misunderstanding of slavery is this
dominant idea, during slavery
and after slavery,
of the docile enslaved African.”
And while he has tried to portray
his latest comment
as revolutionary free thought —
“Do you feel that I'm being free 
and I’m thinking free?"
— far from being new
or revolutionary,
the idea that slaves were
complicit in keeping up
with slavery is age old.
Prof. Kendi: "The ideas that he is sharing
are actually quite old.
There was a very prominent
post-slavery theory
that black people were
not resisting enslavement
because they recognized
that enslavement was better
for them.
That really lasted,
even among scholars
who wrote about slavery,
well into the 1940s and 1950s."
By repeating the narrative
that enslaved people were docile
Kanye works to
blame the oppressed
for what happened to them.
It puts all the responsibility
on the individual
and ignores systemic inequality.
Today, the conservative ideology
of individualism
and "pull yourself up by the bootstraps"
follows a similar pattern.
"People want to call it systemic racism.
No!"
"It wasn’t what they were doing to me,
it's what I wasn't doing."
"You do not have to sit around
and wait for somebody else
to do things for you."
Prof. Kendi: "According to this
body of thought
racial disparities exist and persist
because black people
haven’t taken personal responsibility
for their lives,
because there’s something wrong with them,
because they’re enslaved
to the welfare state,
and they refuse to resist
in the way they refuse
to resist to the slaveholder."
This thinking allows Kanye
to claim his own success.
But by using his platform
to share historically inaccurate
information, he makes people
believe that things in the past
would have played out differently
had they been there.
It glosses over the real violence
and suffering of slavery,
and it muddles accountability.
