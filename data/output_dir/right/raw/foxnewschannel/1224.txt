SINGAPORE.

3
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:14,233
IT'LL BE A BEGINNING, I DON'T

4
00:00:14,233 --> 00:00:15,601
SAY AND I NEVER SAID IT HAPPENS

5
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:16,669
IN ONE MEETING.

6
00:00:16,669 --> 00:00:18,070
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YEARS OF

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,874
HOSTILE MY, YEARS OF PROBLEMS.

8
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:24,143
THERE'S REALLY HATRED BETWEEN SO

9
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:24,977
MANY DIFFERENT NATIONS BUT I

10
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:26,312
THINK YOU'LL HAVE A VERY

11
00:00:26,312 --> 00:00:27,546
POSITIVE RESULT IN THE END.

12
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:28,747
PAUL: THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP

13
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:30,149
FRIDAY ANNOUNCING THAT THE

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:31,517
JUNE 12TH SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT

00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,288
SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO

18
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:37,957
AND A TOP NORTH KOREAN OFFICIAL.

19
00:00:37,957 --> 00:00:41,026
THOSE MEETINGS TAPPED OFF BY

20
00:00:41,026 --> 00:00:42,394
VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSE FRIDAY

21
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:44,663
WHERE NORTH KOREAN DELEGATION

22
00:00:44,663 --> 00:00:46,298
DELIVERED A LETTER FROM KIM JONG

23
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:47,099
UN TO PRESIDENT TRUMP.

24
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:49,568
EARLIER I SPOKE WITH REFIRED

25
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:50,436
FOUR-STAR GENERAL JACK KEANE

26
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:52,338
ABOUT THE EXPECTATIONS FOR THE

27
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:53,706
JUNE 12TH MEETING.

28
00:00:53,706 --> 00:00:55,074
SO WE HAVE THE REPORT OF A

29
00:00:55,074 --> 00:01:00,846
LETTER FROM KIM JONG UN TO

30
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:01,513
PRESIDENT TRUMP, APPARENTLY

31
00:01:01,513 --> 00:01:02,147
SAYING I WANT TO HAVE THE

32
00:01:02,147 --> 00:01:03,482
MEETING, BUT NO DEMANDS AND NO

33
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:04,882
CONCESSIONS, IS THAT ENOUGH TO

34
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:07,086
GO AHEAD WITH A SUMMIT?

35
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,087
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK

36
00:01:08,087 --> 00:01:09,888
THAT THE LETTER IS IN RESPONSE

37
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,090
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S LETTER TO

38
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,658
KIM JONG UN AND HE ENDED HIS

39
00:01:12,658 --> 00:01:14,493
LETTER WHEN HE WAS TERMINATING

40
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,562
THE SUMMIT, GET BACK TO ME IF

41
00:01:16,562 --> 00:01:17,529
YOU WANT TO GO FORWARD.

42
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:19,865
THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THIS IS.

43
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:20,399
[LAUGHTER]

44
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:21,700
>> WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH MORE

45
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,201
THAN THAT.

46
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,269
WE HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION

47
00:01:24,269 --> 00:01:25,838
TO WHAT SECRETARY POMPEO IS

48
00:01:25,838 --> 00:01:26,271
SAYING.

49
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:27,840
WHILE HE SAYS ON THE ONE HAND WE

50
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,308
MAKE GREAT PROGRESS, ON THE

51
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:31,010
OTHER HAND, SIGNIFICANT

52
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,077
CHALLENGES AND DIFFERENCES AND I

53
00:01:32,077 --> 00:01:34,680
THINK WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO

54
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,684
AS IN HIS WORDS SET THE

55
00:01:38,684 --> 00:01:39,284
CONDITIONS.

56
00:01:39,284 --> 00:01:40,319
RESOLVE DIFFERENCES SO WE CAN

57
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,054
SET UP AT LEAST THE FIRST SUMMIT

58
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:44,323
BECAUSE LIKELY TO BE MORE THAN

59
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:46,458
THAT WHERE THERE CAN BE SOME

60
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,659
SUCCESS, WHERE THEY CAN AT LEAST

61
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,828
AGREE ON A FRAMEWORK GOING

62
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:50,295
FORWARD.

63
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:52,097
THE PRESIDENT IS REALLY HOLDING

64
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:53,966
ALL THE CARDS HERE, PAUL, I

65
00:01:53,966 --> 00:01:56,301
MEAN, HE DOESN'T NEED THE SUMMIT

66
00:01:56,301 --> 00:01:58,871
AS MUCH AS THE NORTH KOREANS

67
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:01,473
NEED IT AND THIS PERIOD RIGHT

68
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:03,208
NOW, WE ARE GETTING UP CLOSE TO

69
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,778
THE SUMMIT, HE STILL HAS

70
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:07,880
SIGNIFICAN LEVERAGE AND I'M SURE

71
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,848
HE'S USING LEVERAGE TO THE

72
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:12,885
FULLEST WITH POMPEO AND ALSO KIM

73
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:14,753
SUNG OVER IN NORTH KOREA.

74
00:02:14,753 --> 00:02:16,255
PAUL: SEEMS TO ME THAT IF

75
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:19,658
THERE'S JUST A MEET AND GREET

76
00:02:19,658 --> 00:02:21,060
SUMMIT, NO TANGIBLE MOVEMENT ON

77
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,028
THE NORTH KOREAN SIDE TOWARDS

78
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:23,929
DENUCLEARIZATION, THAT'S A

79
00:02:23,929 --> 00:02:26,098
VICTORY FOR KIM JONG UN BECAUSE

80
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:28,033
HE WOULD HAVE SAT ON THE STAGE

81
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:28,801
WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

82
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,102
STATES AND TURNED OUT TO BE KIND

83
00:02:30,102 --> 00:02:32,571
OF A MEET AND GREET, WOULD YOU

84
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:33,672
AGREE WITH THAT?

85
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:35,207
>> I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT.

86
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:36,675
IF THAT'S ALL THERE IS, THEN THE

87
00:02:36,675 --> 00:02:38,210
PRESIDENT AT A MINIMUM SHOULD

88
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,679
DELAY THE SUMMIT AND APPLY MORE

89
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,347
PRESSURE TO TRY TO GET THESE

90
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,016
DIFFERENCES TO CLOSE A LITTLE

91
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,618
BIT AND IF HE CAN'T, HE'S JUST

92
00:02:46,618 --> 00:02:48,487
GOT TO BACK AWAY.

93
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:50,889
HE CANNOT GO IN THERE AND JUST

94
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:53,659
COME OUT WITH A FRAMEWORK FOR A

95
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:56,562
PEACE TREATY ENDING THE WAR AND

96
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:57,663
BRING BACK THE FAMILIES FROM THE

97
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:59,164
NORTH AND THE SOUTH AND REUNITE

98
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:02,067
THEM AND AGREE IN GENERAL THAT

99
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:05,137
THE SECURITY OF NORTH KOREA IS

100
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,105
PARAMOUNT TO THE UNITED STATES,

101
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:08,040
THAT WOULD BE UNSATISFACTORY

102
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,607
SOLUTION.

103
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:12,010
PAUL: OKAY, THERE'S A MERGING

104
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,846
HERE ON DIFFERENCE ON PACE OF

105
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:14,646
DENUCLEARIZATION, THE UNITED

106
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:15,848
STATES SAYING IT MUST BE

107
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:17,683
COMPLETE, VERIFIABLE AND

108
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:18,917
IRREVERSIBLE AND THE NORTH

109
00:03:18,917 --> 00:03:20,586
KOREANS SUGGESTING THAT, WELL,

110
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:22,888
WE WANT THIS TO BE IN A FAZED

111
00:03:22,888 --> 00:03:24,423
FORM, WE WANT TO YOU DO ONE

112
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:27,826
THING AND WE WILL DO SOMETHING.

113
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:29,161
IS THAT WHAT YOU SEE AS THE

114
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,930
BIGGEST GAP THAT HAS TO CLOSE?

115
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,699
>> IT CERTAINLY IS AND THEY WANT

116
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:36,034
TO DO THIS OVER A PERIOD OF MANY

117
00:03:36,034 --> 00:03:38,504
YEARS, CERTAINLY THEY WANT

118
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:39,671
OUTLAST TRUMP'S FIRST TERM

119
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:42,007
BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW IF HE

120
00:03:42,007 --> 00:03:43,208
WILL HAVE A SECOND ONE, I THINK

121
00:03:43,208 --> 00:03:44,443
THE PRESIDENT IS RIGHT ON THE

122
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:45,978
MARK WHEN HE'S SAYING, I WANT TO

123
00:03:45,978 --> 00:03:48,280
GET THIS DONE DURING MY

124
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,582
PRESIDENCY, DURING MY FIRST

125
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:51,517
TERM, TWO PLUS YEARS IS

126
00:03:51,517 --> 00:03:53,785
SUFFICIENT TIME TO GET IT DONE.

127
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,221
WE CAN FAZE IT DURING THOSE TWO

128
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:57,456
YEARS, I'M NOT GOING TO PASS

129
00:03:57,456 --> 00:03:59,892
THIS PROBLEM ONTO SUCCESS OR AS

130
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:01,560
IT'S BEEN PASSED ONTO ME AND I

131
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,794
THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE GOAL

132
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:04,630
TO HAVE AND WE SHOULD STICK TO

133
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,097
IT.

134
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:08,934
PAUL: AS WE KNOW, WE HAVE DONE

135
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:10,435
TWICE BEFORE, PROMISE OF

136
00:04:10,435 --> 00:04:11,670
DENUCLEARIZATION OVER STAGES AND

137
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,273
BOTH TIMES THE NORTH KOREANS

138
00:04:14,273 --> 00:04:16,007
RENEGED, STOPPED, KICKED OUT

139
00:04:16,007 --> 00:04:18,410
INSPECTORS, SO, I MEAN, IT'S A

140
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,613
BIT OF A GAMBLE WITH THE UNITED

141
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:22,681
STATES, WITH ANY PRESIDENT

142
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:24,917
TAKING THEIR WORD FOR IT AGAIN.

143
00:04:24,917 --> 00:04:25,884
>> I TOTALLY AGREE.

144
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:29,721
RUSSIANS AND CHINESE ARE BOTH

145
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,491
ADVISING KIM JONG UN TO TO THE

146
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:35,060
FAZED OPERATION AND PUSH IT OUT

147
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,895
OVER MANY YEARS FOR THE VERY

148
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:37,996
REASON THAT THE NORTH KOREANS

149
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:40,566
ARE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF US IN THE

150
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:41,133
PAST.

151
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:42,734
IT'S A PROMISE THAT IS NOT KEPT

152
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,403
AND THAT'S CLEARLY THE PATH THAT

153
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:46,405
WE WOULD BE ON IF WE BUY INTO

154
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:46,838
IT.

155
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:49,174
PAUL: CAN THE U.S. PRESIDENT PUT

156
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,943
THE STATUS OF U.S. FORCES IN

157
00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:53,579
SOUTH KOREA ON THE TABLE TO

158
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:54,813
NEGOTIATE IN RETURN FOR SOME

159
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,783
PROMISE OF DENUCLEARIZATION?

160
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:59,251
>> YES, I THINK HE CAN.

161
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:01,386
THAT WOULD REALLY UNNERVE THE

162
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,088
JAPANESE QUITE A BIT BUT THAT

163
00:05:03,088 --> 00:05:05,524
DOESN'T MEAN IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

164
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:07,059
IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL OR COMPLETE

165
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:07,492
WITHDRAWAL.

166
00:05:07,492 --> 00:05:10,229
THAT COULD BE DONE OVER TIME AND

167
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,097
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ALL AT

168
00:05:12,097 --> 00:05:12,531
ONCE.

169
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:14,533
IT COULD BE A GRADUAL WITHDRAWAL

170
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:15,767
OF THOSE FORCES.

171
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,135
LISTEN, IF WE HAVE A PEACE

172
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,972
TREATY AND THE WAR HAS ENDED AND

173
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:25,677
KIM JONG UN IS DENUCLEARIZING

174
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:28,447
AND TAKING SYSTEMS, THE REASON

175
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,182
TROOPS WOULD BE GOING AWAY, BE

176
00:05:30,182 --> 00:05:32,251
ABLE TO PULL ARMIES AWAY FROM

177
00:05:32,251 --> 00:05:34,119
EACH OTHER IN THE DMZ.

178
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:35,487
THAT'S SORT OF A HAPPY SOLUTION

179
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:36,722
AND UNLIKELY TO GET SOMETHING

180
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:39,625
LIKE THAT, I BELIEVE, BUT

181
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,828
NONETHELESS, IT WOULD

182
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:44,296
DELEGITIMIZE THE PRESENCE OF

183
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:44,730
28,000 TROOPS.

184
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,031
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS IN THE

185
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,866
BACK OF HIS MIND, NOT INITIALLY

186
00:05:47,866 --> 00:05:49,868
BUT EVENTUALLY HE WOULD PUT

187
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:52,170
THOSE TROOPS ON THE TABLE TO GET

188
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,740
A FINAL COMPLETION OF

189
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,240
DENUCLEARIZATION.

190
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,475
PAUL: WHAT ABOUT SECURITY

191
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,376
GUARANTIES THAT THE NORTH

192
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:59,811
KOREANS ARE TALKING ABOUT --

193
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:01,513
HAVE TALKED ABOUT FOR KIM JONG

194
00:06:01,513 --> 00:06:01,780
UN?

195
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,881
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

196
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:04,416
REALLY PROMISE KIM?

197
00:06:04,416 --> 00:06:07,019
HOW CAN WE GUARANTY HIS

198
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:07,919
CONTINUATION IN POWER

199
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,021
PARTICULARLY IF THEY OPEN UP TO

200
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,123
THE WORLD AND PEOPLE SEE JUST

201
00:06:11,123 --> 00:06:14,593
HOW THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE ARE?

202
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:16,795
>> WELL, IT IS THEIR NUMBER ONE

203
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:18,797
ISSUE, ECONOMICS, PROSPERITY IS

204
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:20,399
NOT THEIR NUMBER ONE ISSUE.

205
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,533
THIS IS THE ISSUE, IT'S THE

206
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:23,235
REASON THEY HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS

207
00:06:23,235 --> 00:06:25,070
AND IT'S THE REASON WHY THEY ARE

208
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,440
NUCLEAR -- THEY ARE WEPONIZING

209
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,941
ICBM'S BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HOLD

210
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:32,110

211
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,079
GUARANTY THE PRESERVATION OF THE

212
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:34,613
REGIME.

213
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:35,747
WE WILL NEVER GET A DEAL WITH

214
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:37,916
THEM EVEN ON THE BEST OF

215
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,284
CIRCUMSTANCES UNLESS WE ARE ABLE

216
00:06:39,284 --> 00:06:41,119
TO CONVINCE THEM THAT WE ARE

217
00:06:41,119 --> 00:06:44,623
PROVIDING A GRANTOR OF THEIR

218
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:45,257
INDEFINITE SECURITY.

219
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,059
KIM IS A YOUNG MAN AND HE'S

220
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:49,394
CLEARLY GOT THAT IN MIND AS HE

221
00:06:49,394 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOKS TO DECADES AHEAD.
