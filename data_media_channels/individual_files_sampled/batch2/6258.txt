tax cuts that have already been implemented Republicans have decided that they want to compound their mistakes by passing tax cuts 2.0 so this was a proposal by Republicans in Congress this week and they are essentially proposing to make some of the tax cuts which were set to expire over the next decade permanent so for instance they want to make permanent individual tax cuts small business income deductions and a larger child tax credit in this 2.0 version and as we had previously reported they're also considering lowering taxes on capital gains so we already have an explosion in deficits as a result of the first round of tax cuts under the Trump administration this would certainly make the situation a lot worse as I had mentioned before the American people don't like the tax cuts as they stand now about 37% of voters approve of them 42% disapprove of them and that's according to Real Clear Politics doing an average of polling on this topic now with that said representative Kevin Brady goes on cable news and starts talking about tax cuts 2.0 and how fantastic it's gonna be but later we're gonna have a CNBC report or list all the ways it's disastrous so take a look are you sure you don't want to just consolidate your first tax reform plan to make sure that that isn't to make sure that is an overturned or repealed because I think a lot of Democrats are running on that aren't they yeah in November well they are running on it's a huge mistake because no one wants to go back to the bad old days where the economy was flat paychecks were flat and jobs and companies were we're moving overseas at record pace I don't know anyone who wants to go back to that yeah paychecks are flat wages remains stagnant I know that people don't like to talk about that on cable news especially but wages have not kept up with inflation at all which is part of the reason why Americans are not buying these tax cuts it didn't actually help their wages so Kevin Brady says nobody wants to go to the back bad old days back to the bad old days and Stephen Moore on television Trump supporter so-called economists had said that well Trump got GDP above four points and Trump had bragged about how hey this the first time GDP is higher than unemployment in the last 100 years even his own White House had to say yeah that's not true no he made that up okay of course of course he made it up and he can't help himself as a pathological liar but in reality Obama had four quarters over 4% GDP do you remember Kevin Brady or Stephen Moore or any of these guys are Trump tweeting like congratulations Obama all those wonderful quarters were in genie fees above 4% no oh it's the bad old days oh we got to make America great again now Trump does it was they're like they know they know that a single quarter of 4.1% GDP growth means nothing they know it they just look the reason why they're touting the economy is because the economy is real good for them in their buddies that's what they're doing they know they know I mean we have a record number of senior citizens filing for bankruptcy I'm talking about retirement age senior citizens filing for bankruptcy because they can't afford health care in America okay we're talking about Millennials who will be dealing with student loan debt for the rest of their lives because of how insanely expensive tuition is and federal government has no interest in helping them out whatsoever okay we're talking about people we're really suffering under this disastrous economy with their stagnant wages and then you have representatives like Kevin Brady going on television talking about how fantastic everything is and then he's simultaneously defames people who know and say that this is a disastrous system in fact I have an example of that take a look I just wonder because I you know it just depends on where I look whether it's Twitter or other places I've got people telling me that the tax reform did not work yeah I know you try to get the message out a lot and Krum president Trump tries to get the message out a lot how can the Democrats run on the economy in November given where we are right now I don't think they can Wow yeah I think is a huge mistake you know I the bottom line is I don't think they're worried about tax cuts for the wealthy I think they're worried about tax cuts for every American because look if Washington doesn't have first claim over your earnings and Washington can't spend it that's a problem for Democrats we've chosen to really make a modest smart investment in the economy which is growing in really significant ways we redesign the code so our local companies in New York throughout the country can compete when anywhere in the world so these tax cuts will add will cost us nearly two trillion dollars over the next decade and that's just the first version of the tax cuts if they do tax cuts 2.0 it'll be way more secondly again middle-class Americans didn't see a significant cut in their taxes corporations did the wealthy did they did not cut corporate tax loopholes and they lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% prior to the tax cuts the effective tax rates when you take loopholes into account was 17% so can you imagine how much lower it's gonna be now that they've lowered the corporate tax rate and they've refused to close corporate tax loopholes they think we're stupid that's what that's why I want you guys to get out of this okay Kevin Brady should be voted out of office because he thinks you're stupid and you're not okay we know what's happening we see it in our paychecks and by the way as this is all going on they're having discussions about entitlements reform right let's cut Social Security let's cut Medicare that's what we've paid into okay so I was amused by the adjective that Brady used just a modest cut came out of here a one point nine trillion dollars for all my friends I don't know why anybody would complain about that let's do a 2.0 I'm gonna get back to the greed of 2.0 in a second but I was actually more amused by the CNBC anchor first of all on the Leanback okay and he's like wow Blanding about the economy well okay so let me explain to you why okay mister lean back number one wages when you take inflationary count have gone down so you and your friends on CNBC and all the CEOs you know are making money hand over fist so in your social circle everybody is incredibly wealthy so you but you apparently can't say outside your own perspective really I don't know everybody I know is stinking rich and we love these tax cuts but wages have gone down for the average American ok point number two they're dying from health care costs as student debt and they're it's an albatross around their neck and do you know what the minimum wage is of course you don't you never thought about it for a second the minimum wage you might know that it's $7.25 at the federal level but over the course of a year that's $15,000 $15,000 per eighty a year for all the friends of that CNBC anchor $15,000 is a blip in their stock market holdings they wouldn't even notice the $15,000 over went down one for a minute for an hour all my friends put on their Monaco's and say this is it every economy dear chap right well the rest of us don't feel that man and the fact that you can't see that is amazing right oh yeah luckily there was one CNN reporter sannen CNBC I should say reporter who did list all the ways that the tax cut 2.0 plan would be a disaster and so I want to give her credit I don't know how to pronounce her name but I'm gonna show you who she is just a minute let's take a look now there were two big problems though with this bill the first being that it would make caps on state and local income tax deductions permanent as well and that's gonna anger Republicans in New York New Jersey and even in California this bill is also estimated to cost six hundred and twenty seven billion dollars over the next decade that price tag is pretty high now Brady told Republicans in the meeting that he considers this a modest investment in households and that he believes deficits would be even higher if tax reform 1.0 hadn't been passed so it's gonna add another six hundred billion dollars to the nearly two trillion dollars that the first version of the tax cuts is costing us over the next decade the the idea that deficits would be higher without the tax cuts is laughable preposterous no one could actually believe that he's lying to you through his teeth and he knows it and then he gets off-camera and laughs at you behind your back so final thing is why do a second round of tax cuts for the rich when the first round is polling really badly and that Real Clear Politics average has a couple of issues with it the more recent polls it's an average the more recent polls have the numbers at way lower right and in fact Republicans in a couple of special elections stop doing ads bragging about the tax cuts in the middle of the elections because it was counterproductive the more people heard about the tax cuts the more they hated the Republican so they know because they've already pulled their own ads bragging about the tax cuts they know that how unpopular it is so why would you do another round of tax cuts right before an election because they think it might be the last time they control Congress hmm so it's the last robbery they're like look man what difference does it make we're about to get kicked out or our donors want their return on investment let's go in for one last heist so that's what Kevin Brady and a lot of those CNBC anchors end up to be fair at a lot of the cable news anchors overall are talking about today and and they just can't understand why you don't want to be robbed one last time there's a good way to show them it's a November of 2018 the TYT Plus app is now available on iOS and and download to get more TYT content at TYT dot-com /
