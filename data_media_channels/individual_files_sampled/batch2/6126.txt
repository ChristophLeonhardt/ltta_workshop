I'm fairly confident that Donald Trump could not locate South Africa on a map of South Africa and yet still tweeted this I have asked Secretary of State Secretary Pompeo on the second try he did tagged the right secretary Pompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and a large-scale killing of farmers and that he quoted Tucker Carlson which is a great idea South African government is now seizing land from white farmers just in case it was a little bit too subtle in the beginning no they're white farmers and so but this is a story that you might not be too familiar with unless you spend a lot of time on 4chan or Stormfront or something like that but the idea there and this has been going around as we will demonstrate is that the government of South Africa is participating in or at the very least casting like a blind eye on the genocide of white farmers in South Africa now what is interesting of course is that hypothetically you could actually look into this you could look at the numbers and see if you know white farmers are being completely wiped out and it was genocide against whites there that turns out it's not actually the case media reports suggest that the number of killings of white farmers actually hit a 20-year low last year and the BBC actually looked into it and they found that there was no reliable data to suggest that farmers were at greater risk of being murdered than the average South African so it might be the case that farmers die and certainly they do we've got numbers on that other people die in South Africa as well it looks like the chance of you dying as a farmer is the same as anyone else in South Africa but don't allow that to stop you from taking this story and then saying as an American we too should be worried about white genocide because look it's already happening elsewhere so let's pause there to talk about how they do propaganda so if all you heard from all these right-wing hate sites was oh my god 43 white farmers have been killed already this year in South Africa they're trying to take their land in their kill all these white farmers see what I think that's dozens and dozens of oh my god it's an epidemic but if you didn't hear the context that John just gave you that it's actually a 20-year low you might say wait look man no white farmers should die hey look nobody on the I'm gonna die right but how about if you get the context that it is the same rate as every other South African as John just told you so if we wanted to do randomly propaganda to get you to scare plumbers in the country we could be like oh my god forty three plumbers have been murdered in South Africa oh they're killing all the plumbers I mean it sounds absurd when you say it about plumbers but it's the same rate okay or dentist my god these weird South Africa's are attacking all the dentists in in South Africa forty-three dentists have been killed yeah it's the same number yeah and look it's frustrating because obviously like as an empathic person like we're progressives we actually care about people any farmer dying or even being attacked because of course there are more attacks than there are murders is an actual tragedy that the government needs to do something about but we're not going to simply simply parrot it and not pretend that that's not advancing white nationalist arguments either inside of South Africa or here in the US and in other countries as well now thankfully South Africa their government has actually responded to Donald Trump's assertions on Twitter saying South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past and then since South Africa will speed up the pace of land reform in a careful and inclusive manner that does not divide our nation because of course in the background all of of all this is the actual land reform program which effectively every party there generally every major party agrees needs to happen now the reason is that is that all of the land was stolen from black farmers in the colonial past of that country and despite the fact that now whites are a small percentage of the country they make up 9% of the country they still after you know quite a few years have passed through the after the the turnover of their government they still own 72% of the farm land and so they want to do some sort of land reform so it's been 24 years since they ended apartheid but the white farmers still owned 72 percent of the land the land that is owned by individuals just to be specific right and in the farms okay so it is actually a really difficult and interesting problem and I don't agree with the position of the ANC in South Africa their position and a position pursued by other groups including the populace economic freedom fighters party is let's just naturalize the line let's just take it and not compensate them now that is not the current position of South Africa after apartheid ended they did a program which to me made a lot of sense whenever a farmer wanted to sell his land the government would buy it at the market rate great then the farmer wins he gets the market rate now the government takes the land and then it does whatever they're gonna do to bring about a little bit of justice and it's a difficult problem because you don't we care about everybody including the white farmers yeah I don't know that if it was their families that did it generations ago but it wasn't them right and even if they lived through apartheid it's not the right thing to do to say okay now your land is mine and I'm kicking you out or or certainly taking any kind of physical action against them at the same time that land was stolen in the beginning they came in and they took the land of the Africans who lived there so but that was a while back you can't so it's not like just oh you stole it so I'm gonna put you in prison and take it back right that's not you know that's not the case it's generations later it might even not be the same family they might have bought it from someone else etc etc right so that's a difficult question how do you resolve it because the local population says are we just gonna let them keep it when we know they stole it in the first place not they but other people stole it from us in the first place on the other hand you got to respect the rights of the people who are there and everybody's got to live together so I actually think the original proposal 94 the one that's still law in South Africa is the right one when they sell and it is frustratingly slow and that is why a lot of people in the country are now getting tired of it but I don't think it's right to change the constitution now the good thing is they haven't changed the Constitution and that Constitution is very hard to change you need a two-thirds vote and the South African president cyril ramaphosa is against a proposal he's a moderate who is pro-business and he wants to attract other people into the country so it is not the law of South Africa that they're taking the land of white farmers and there is not an epidemic of white farmers being killed so why do you twist what's happened now you could if Tucker Carlson and storm front and whoever else is reporting it just came out and said hey this is a proposal in South Africa and it's a proposal we don't agree with this really problematic nobody would even do this so we said okay that's a fair point we might do that story yeah no that's not what they're doing this is just as amazing as I care about the plight of farmers in South Africa it is purely a race thing they believe that this is a good stand-in for what they're worried about will happen in the US they know that our government which was run by white supremacists for decades after decades after decades and was able to consolidate huge amounts of land and economic you know like economic output and stuff like that past policies obviously helped some groups and hurt other groups oh my god if the demographics changed they might finally take this from us and they're seeing it happen some more or at least they're they're being convinced by others that it's happening and so they're worried about it that is why they're talking about that's the only reason they're talking about it and the only reason Donald Trump is talking about it is one that he watches far too much fox news when he should actually be doing some work or exercising or something like that and two that it provides a nice way to try to reassure some of his base who were probably at least a little bit worried about the 16 guilty pleas that some of his entourage have pled to this week that he is still their guy that he is still going to stand up for them on the one issue that is more important to them than all other issues which is white identity and so the reason we give you this context is because you see it all across the internet and you'll think oh my it because the right-wing systematically lie and they they twist the context of all the stories and they're doing it clearly in this case all their websites are doing it Tucker Carlson's doing it and even now the President of the United States and they're doing it brazenly they even put base or white farmers etc now if you say no wait guys even though you've given me all the context for some reason I'm gonna insist that Tucker Carlson has an obsession with those poor 43 people who were killed okay then I ask you why didn't tuck her Carlson do segments over and over again about Thoreau Hannah so 700,000 ruhango were displaced in the similar time frame just in the first month of the massacres that happened in Myanmar six thousand seven hundred people were killed including seven hundred and thirty children under the age of five yeah and in Tucker Elson do one story after another did Donald Trump about that no it's not because they care about kids it's not because they care about people or farmers the point of this story is for them to say look at the black people taking the white people's property away and killing them be afraid of black people yeah I don't watch Tucker Carlson it's possible that he did do that I kind of doubt it but if he did feel free to send it to a symbol give him that credit I don't expect that that will happen but we do want at least briefly talk about this as an example of something that has happened many times before a story like this it bubbles up from the darkest depths of the all right online conservatives things like that and that eventually gets to the official communication channel for the most powerful person in the world which is Donald Trump's Twitter page so we're gonna go back through on a number of pages the earliest example we were able to find of this sort of story now we can't discount the possibility that there might have been an earlier one but this is what we were able to find so first of all on storm front if we bring up this you'll see that in there they're like chat pages their message board or whatever they were talking about this quite a while ago back in November of 2016 talking about farm murders in South Africa they're talking about genocide restitution restitution all that stuff torture gang rape all of that stuff and then we can skip past this next graphic can you see that eventually it does hit bright bar hey that's a little bit later on literally says epidemic of murders continue etc yeah it's trending down obviously still an issue you can say that but you can't say that it's an epidemic or that it's getting worse because the numbers of course are trending down and they have to put genocide because that is the code word for white nationalists across American across Europe now you then jump ahead to hits Infowars eventually which I'm putting as more reputable than Breitbart in this case they are June 28th and so suddenly now this is more I don't think Trump is probably watching much Breitbart or reading it because it would happen with Bannen but he certainly likes Infowars so that's something that he'll notice and if you jump ahead you'll see that uh Alex Jones is a is tweeting about this white farmers being hunted down and killed at record level numbers for multiple decades he didn't put that part but that was there and then what do you know it hits daily wire more reputable more mainstream conservative site there are no reputable right-wing say but that's what it's pitched at the very least and then Tucker Carlson picks it up and immediately after that it's on Twitter Donald Trump is dispatching a Secretary of State to deal with what in less than two years went from something that a Pepe branded avatar on a storm front the white supremacist site was talking about in a message board post it goes from that to Donald Trump's Twitter to official US policy storm front a neo Nazis from Nazis the Donald Trump you just saw it that's how it gets done and then they'll turn around go I can't believe you'd call this racist believe it want to see more videos like this well you can all you have to do is
