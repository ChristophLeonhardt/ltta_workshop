let's bring in right now ambassador McFaul he is also in Helsinki mr. ambassador I'll ask you the same thing what what should Donald Trump be trying to get right now from Vladimir Putin or what should they talk about but before you answer that question you but you obviously know Vladimir Putin better than most not personally but you've studied him more as ambassador to Russia from the United States and you also know the country better than most of us it seems that Vladimir Putin in the mind of many Americans has been reduced to a two-dimensional character over the past several years and Russia our view of Russia also a bit more two-dimensional than perhaps it should be why don't you give us insights a little more insight into Russia right now Vladimir Putin his hold on power what he is concerned about domestically what he is concerned about internationally and what we should be concerned about well just so yeah we're not Facebook friends at least to the best of my knowledge but I have known glad Amir Putin for a long time and I've participated in a half a dozen of these summits with various President Obama and other officials with Latimer Putin where he is right now I think he's feeling pretty confident he has a firm grip on power at home they know challengers at home he's just had a fantastic World Cup where the whole world is saw Russia from a different side and he's now engaging with President Trump who's coming in at a very weak point he's arguing with his allies he's calling his allies a foe by the way the EU consists mostly of NATO allies he's calling our friends foes and so I think he's feeling pretty confident going to this meeting right now with President Trump David Ignatius I'll ask you the same thing based on what you know what is Vladimir Putin's standing in Russia right now what are his chief concerns what should be our chief concerns well he's obviously personally popular and that's especially true after the World Cup which was a celebration of the Russia that the Putin wants to display to the world he still has stuck with essentially a one commodity economy but he's helped in that by his new working alliance with Saudi Arabia Saudis now speak of something they call OPEC Plus which is the traditional Arab blood OPEC plus Russia so so clean has some interesting new allies a final point I would make as we talk about the agenda Syria is a key part of Vladimir Putin's a foreign policy was the decisive intervention and it's been very successful in the sense of consolidating power for the Assad regime it's now commonplace to say that Assad is one and it's also a fact that the u.s. is basically acceded to that no longer resisting and the key ally that that Putin has had in shaping that diplomacy over the last couple months interestingly is Israel Bibi Netanyahu the Israeli prime minister has a very good working relationship from everything we can tell with Putin so Putin comes to this the summit meeting with prompt with more cards than you might even than you might think he does have popular at home in a world of somewhat recovering all prices he's got a little more money to work with he's gone through the worst of the period of sanctions without terrible damage to the to the Russian economy and as I said earlier I think for Putin the theme presumably is let's let bygones be bygones let's turn the page now you mr. president see Russia in a different way you're not caught we're predecessor Barack Obama was in criticism of Russia let's let's let's walk into the future together try to cooperate on arms control other issues so I think that's probably the tone we're going to see we were looking at pictures of meeting earlier in Helsinki Finland of Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump when they first met gave brief opening statements bill neely of NBC News noted that Vladimir Putin came prepared with the notepad and pen Donald Trump not so for their one-on-one meeting where there will be no note takers other than it appears Vladimir Putin let's go to Moscow right now and talk to Richard Engel and ask Richard what what Richard do the Russians want out of this meeting with Donald Trump what is Vladimir Putin's strategic goal so strategically I think Russia feels as you were just talking about with Davis and ambassador McFaul very confident right now as you've said numerous times they had a successful World Cup the whole world's attention was focused on Russia and the overwhelming majority of the coverage was positive President Trump went through Europe like a a bulldozer blasting NATO blasting the EU and is now showing up to meet with Vladimir Putin even though this indictment which is just accused Russian intelligence officials of carrying out a Watergate against the US elections the meeting is still going on so strategically Russia's feeling you know in a very good place now it's about the tactics what will they specifically ask for in this in this meeting and if you look at the statements that have come out of the Kremlin even this morning it seems like they might have specific ass regarding Syria there are about 2000 u.s. special forces in Syria Russia doesn't want them there Russia backs the government of Bashar al-assad and those 2000 American special forces who've been primarily fighting Isis but also helping Kurdish fighters are seen as getting in the way of Russian influence in that country so what Russia will likely offer is we promise we Russia will promise to lower Iran's influence in Syria in exchange your troops have to either leave or stop being quite as active as they have been and the question is can Russia really even deliver on that will Russia even deliver on that is the specific ask just to reduce the u.s. footprint in Syria also likely we're understanding specific ask regarding NATO while NATO has taken a bruising and a battering from statements we'll see if there are a specific ask that Russia doesn't want NATO exercises to to continue right on its border so I think strategically Russia's in a good place now they're gonna come in with a notebook full of things that might seem minor to president Trump like those military exercises that got canceled in South Korea but which to the to Russia or to South Korea in that case or to North Korea are a very very big deal all right Richard Engel in Moscow thank you so much for those insights we greatly appreciate it let's go to ambassador McFaul right now back in Helsinki mr. ambassador we didn't really comment yet didn't hear your insights yet on Donald Trump's continued attacks of NATO Donald Trump's continued attacks of the European Union when asked to America's chief foe was he brought up the European Union first that must be that must be music to Vladimir Putin's ears is one commentator a public opinion leader in Russia said on Russian television last week that's something that even the Soviets weren't able able to achieve but now they've achieved it through Donald Trump yeah just really disappointing the EU is not our foe that's ridiculous most of the countries of NATO are also in the European Union they are our allies and partners number 2 the president also tweeted that America is at fault blame America first for the tensions in us-russian relations not mentioning the fact that Russia annexed territory in Crimea and and started and sparked a war 10,000 people have died in eastern Ukraine not mentioning that he supported this brutal dictator in Syria where a half a million people have died and not mentioning the fact that he violated our sovereignty in 2016 so all of those things in my view are the reasons why there's tension in us-russian relations and for president Trump to just insinuate as he just did in his initial remarks today well bygones let's just forget about all that stuff and let's move on because I really want to have a great relationship with you Putin that is just not serving America's national interest in my view no and of course framing his opening statements with congratulations for a World Cup well-run not a not exactly what is on the hearts and minds of not only many Americans but also a lot of Europeans in democratically elected countries across that just to add to that remember the things he didn't mention he mentioned arms control he threw in China out of the blue we're gonna talk about China but he didn't mention Ukraine he didn't mention Syria and he didn't mention the Russian intelligence officers who interfered in our election in 2016 setting the agenda for the meeting the things that he didn't say were really striking to me again it did not mention that interference despite the fact that the man that he picked to oversee America's Intel community just this past weekend said that what Russia did was an attempt to undermine American democracy on the daily basis mr. ambassador thank you so much for being with us Peter Baker would like to thank you as well for being with us greatly appreciate both of your time and right now in Helsinki the president and Vladimir Putin are behind closed doors in their one-on-one conversation that meeting will be expanded
