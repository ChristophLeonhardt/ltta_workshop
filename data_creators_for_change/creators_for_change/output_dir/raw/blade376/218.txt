party too many<font color="#CCCCCC"> cats and carrots but</font>

47

useless but by all means if you manage

55
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,110
to get someone if you manage to take

56
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,299
someone's goodwill and turn it around

57
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,260
and manipulate them make them die inside

58
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,690
that someone they trusted actually got

59
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,510
the better of them if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>
