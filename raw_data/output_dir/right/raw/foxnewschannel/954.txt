00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:02,005
IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK CITY, AND

00:00:02,005 --> 00:00:08,579
THIS IS "THE FIVE" ."

3
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,414
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BACK IN THE

00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,783
U.S. FOLLOWING HIS HISTORIC

00:00:12,783 --> 00:00:13,617
SUMMIT IN SINGAPORE WITH

6
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:14,018
KIM JONG UN.

7
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,586
THE PRESIDENT IS NOW SAYING THAT

8
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:18,589
NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT A NUCLEAR

9
00:00:18,589 --> 00:00:19,356
THREAT FROM NORTH KOREA.

10
00:00:19,356 --> 00:00:20,791
THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF IS ALSO

11
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:21,959
SITTING DOWN WITH BRET BAIER,

12
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:24,095
TELLING HIM U.S. COMBAT TROOPS

13
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:25,763
WILL REMAIN ON THE KOREAN

14
00:00:25,763 --> 00:00:26,130
PENINSULA.

15
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,532
>> IS THE MILITARY DRAWING DON

16
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:29,200
IN SOUTH KOREA?

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,535
YOU KIND OF HINTED AT THAT?

18
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:33,404
IS THERE GOING TO BE A

19
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:33,804
TIT-FOR-TAT?

20
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,406
>> NOT DRAWING DOWN AT ALL.

21
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:36,407
IT WAS NEVER DISCUSSED.

22
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:37,908
I'M SURE HE WOULD LIKE THAT.

23
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:41,712
IT WAS NEVER ON THE TABLE.

24
00:00:41,712 --> 00:00:46,150
WITH THAT BEING UNDERSTOOD AND

25
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,151
YOU ASKING ME A QUESTION LIKE

26
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,986
THAT, I WOULD LOVE TO GET THE

MILITARY OUTAGES AND AS WE CAN

28
00:00:50,254 --> 00:00:51,689
BECAUSE IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY

29
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,691
AND A LOT OF MONEY FOR US.

30
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,293
WE DON'T GET PAID FULLY FOR IT.

31
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:57,762
I WILL BE TALKING TO SOUTH KOREA

32
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:00,131
ABOUT IT.

33
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:03,400
WE HAVE 32,000 SOLDIERS IN

34
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:03,801
SOUTH KOREA.

35
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:05,236
I WOULD LIKE TO GET THEM HOME

36
00:01:05,236 --> 00:01:07,671
BUT IS NOT ON THE TABLE RIGHT

37
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:07,972
NOW.

38
00:01:07,972 --> 00:01:10,007

STATE MIKE POMPEO SAYS THE U.S.

44
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:18,983
WANTS TO SEE KIM JONG UN MAKING

00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:19,517
PROGRESS TOWARDS THE

46
00:01:19,517 --> 00:01:20,851
DENUCLEARIZATION BEFORE THE END

47
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,820
OF TRUMP'S FIRST TERM.

48
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,121
THE PRESIDENT IS TAKING AIM AT

49
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:25,823

50
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:27,958

00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:31,996
"SO FUNNY TO WATCH THE

53
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:32,630
FAKE NEWS, ESPECIALLY NBC

54
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,197
AND CNN.

55
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:33,831
THEY ARE FIGHTING HARD TO

56
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:34,498
DOWNPLAY THE DEAL WITH NORTH

57
00:01:34,498 --> 00:01:35,032
KOREA.

58
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:36,100
500 DAYS AGO THEY WOULD HAVE

59
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,700
"BEGGED" FOR THIS DEAL.

60
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,468
LOOKED LIKE WAR WOULD BREAK OUT.

61
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:38,769
OUR COUNTRY'S BIGGEST ENEMY

62
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,237
IS THE FAKE NEWS SO EASILY

63
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:46,744
PROMULGATED BY FOOLS!"

GREG.

65
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:50,548
YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN

66
00:01:50,548 --> 00:01:51,582
"PROMULGATED BY FOOLS."

67
00:01:51,582 --> 00:01:53,350
>> Greg: I AM.

68
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,652
EVERYBODY HERE BY NATURE IS

69
00:01:54,652 --> 00:01:55,953
SKEPTICAL.

70
00:01:55,953 --> 00:01:57,788
WE ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT

71
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:58,189
EVERYTHING.

72
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,393
I FIND IT I GUESS FUNNY THAT THE

73
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:03,394
LEAST SKEPTICAL PEOPLE ON EARTH

74
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,395
ARE DEMANDING THAT WE BE

75
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:06,363
SKEPTICAL, SO THESE ARE THE

76
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:10,201
PEOPLE THAT SMEAR YOU IF YOU ARE

77
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,603
SKEPTICAL ABOUT CUBA OR CLIMATE

78
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:16,674
CHANGE OR STATS ON MASS

79
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:17,341
SHOOTINGS.

80
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,343
IF YOU'RE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE

81
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:21,245
PARIS ACCORDS, IRAN, COMMUNISM,

82
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:23,380
SOCIALISM, VENEZUELA.

83
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,515
IF YOU ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT THAT,

84
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:30,421
YOU ARE HEARTLESS.

85
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:38,529
WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN SKEPTICAL.

86
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:39,964
I HAD MICHAEL MALICE ON MY

87
00:02:39,964 --> 00:02:42,366
PODCAST TODAY.

88
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:43,400
HE TWEETED SOMETHING GOOD.

89
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,337
HE SAID THIS ON MY SHOW.

90
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:48,005
IF YOU THINK THE POSSIBILITY OF

91
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:48,973
PEACE IS WORSE THAN THE

92
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:50,474
POSSIBILITY OF WAR, THERE MUST

93
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,576
BE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

94
00:02:52,576 --> 00:02:54,578
HE SAYS HE HAS A GOOD METAPHOR

95
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:56,013
THAT NORTH KOREA IS LIKE A

96
00:02:56,013 --> 00:03:00,384
HOSTAGE SITUATION.

97
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:03,020
THE PROTOCOL IS YOU TRY TO GET

98
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,588
THE HOSTAGE TAKER TO PUT THE

99
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,790
GUNS DOWN AND YOU DO THAT FIRST

100
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:09,560
BY DIALOGUE, AND THEN, WHETHER

101
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,929
THAT MEANS REASSURING HIM WITH A

102
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:18,302
FILM, THAT MIGHT WORK.

103
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:20,137
IT'S TERRIBLE AND NORTH KOREA.

104
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:23,173
THEY HAVE CONCENTRATION CAMPS.

105
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:25,976
THEY HAD GENOCIDE IN THE '90s.

106
00:03:25,976 --> 00:03:28,379
IT'S A RUTHLESS REGIME.

107
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,080
CONTAINMENT DOESN'T WORK.

108
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,748
CONTAINMENT DOESN'T HELP THE

109
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:34,151
HOSTAGES FEEL GOOD.

110
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:37,755
A HOSTAGE AND MIGHT THINK TRUMP

111
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:38,756
IS SAVING ME.

112
00:03:38,756 --> 00:03:40,291
>> Kimberly: DANA, WHAT DO YOU

113
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,793
MAKE IN TERMS, WE'VE HAD TIME

114
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:44,161
SINCE THE HISTORIC SUMMIT TO SEE

115
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:47,331
THE FALLOUT, THE DISCUSSION,

116
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,799
PEOPLE TAKE DIFFERENT SIDES IN

117
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,566
TERMS OF THEIR OPINION OF WHAT

118
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:51,902
THEY THINK TRANSPIRED.

119
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:53,404
>> Dana: I THINK IT IS STILL A

120
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:54,805
NET PLUS FOR THE PRESIDENT IN

121
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:55,606
THE WORLD.

122
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:56,173
THERE IS STILL HOPE.

123
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:58,509
THERE IS SKEPTICISM BUT IT'S

124
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,746
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

125
00:04:02,746 --> 00:04:04,581
SKEPTIC PERKO SKEPTICISM ISN'T

126
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:05,549
NECESSARILY ABOUT

127
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:06,183
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

128
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:08,953
IT'S ABOUT NORTH KOREA AND

129
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:09,687
KIM JONG UN BECAUSE THE REGIME

130
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,188
REPEATEDLY LIED.

131
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:15,826
THEY REPEATEDLY AGREED TO

132
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:22,533
SIMILAR THINGS BACK IN 1996,

133
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:25,369
2,000, 2006.

134
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:26,003
JOURNALISTS ARE SKEPTICAL.

135
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:29,006
CONSERVATIVES ARE SKEPTICAL.

136
00:04:29,006 --> 00:04:31,008
THE SKEPTICISM IS ALSO ABOUT THE

137
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:32,309
NORTH KOREANS, JUST AS IT WAS

138
00:04:32,309 --> 00:04:33,811
ABOUT THE IRANIANS.

139
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,779
I ALSO THINK THAT IN SOME WAYS

140
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:36,580
THERE'S THIS TRIBAL NATURE OF

141
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,415
WHO YOU'RE GOING TO TRUST.

142
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:40,684
IF YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT AND YOU

143
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:47,791
TRUSTED OBAMA AND YOU THOUGHT

144
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,492
THE IRAN DEAL WAS A GOOD ONE.

145
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:49,226
YOU MIGHT THINK THE PERSONNEL,

146
00:04:49,226 --> 00:04:49,927
SECRETARY JOHN KERRY, YOU HAD

147
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:50,361
TRUST IN HIM.

148
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:50,961
CONSERVATIVES DID NOT.

149
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:51,762
I THINK YOU'RE SEEING THE MIRROR

150
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:52,062
IMAGE.

151
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:53,197
REPUBLICANS WILL SAY A TRUST

152
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:53,797
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

153
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:54,965
I THINK HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S

154
00:04:54,965 --> 00:04:55,265
DOING.

155
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:56,667
HE DIDN'T GET IT ALL IN ONE DAY.

156
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:58,268
WE DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.

157
00:04:58,268 --> 00:04:59,003
THEY ALSO RESPECT THE PEOPLE AT

158
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,804
WORK FOR HIM.

159
00:05:00,804 --> 00:05:03,273
JOHN BOLTON, MIKE POMPEO.

160
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:04,575
ON THE OTHER SIDE IT WOULD BE

161
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:05,509
BACK AND FORTH.

162
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:07,978
I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE

163
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:12,549
COST TO AMERICANS TO HAVE OUR

164
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,151
TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA AND IN THE

165
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:15,486
REGION AND TO DO THESE

166
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:19,990
EXERCISES, IT'S NOT JUST INPUT

167
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,357
OUT.

168
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:21,692
IT'S NOT A LOST CAUSE.

169
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:25,162
IT'S IN OUR STRATEGIC NATIONAL

170
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:26,163
INTEREST TO HAVE A PRESENCE

171
00:05:26,163 --> 00:05:26,597
THERE.

172
00:05:26,597 --> 00:05:28,365
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO RAMP

173
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:29,566
IT BACK UP.

174
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:30,267
THERE'S ALWAYS DANGERS LURKING

175
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,036
AROUND THE CORNER.

176
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:33,570
>> Kimberly: DANA BRINGS UP A

177
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,572
GOOD POINT ABOUT SOME OF THE

178
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:36,774
TRIBALISM ABOUT IT.

179
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:37,775
THERE'S PEOPLE WHO TRUST

180
00:05:37,775 --> 00:05:38,242
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

181
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:42,146
PERHAPS THEY LOOKED AT THE OF

182
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:43,947
WHAT HE'S PROMISED AND WHAT HE'S

183
00:05:43,947 --> 00:05:44,415
DELIVERED.

184
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:47,384
IS IT OKAY TO BE OPTIMISTIC

185
00:05:47,384 --> 00:05:48,819
ABOUT HAVING GOOD OUTCOMES?

186
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:50,320
TRUST BUT VERIFY.

187
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,021
>> Jesse: WHAT HAPPENED DURING

188
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:53,190
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION,

189
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,824
BILLIONS OF CASH TO THE

190
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:54,191
AYATOLLAH.

191
00:05:54,191 --> 00:05:58,362
THEY HAD A REALLY BAD TRADE WITH

192
00:05:58,362 --> 00:05:59,063
BERGDAHL, HANDED OVER TALIBAN

193
00:05:59,063 --> 00:05:59,396
MEMBERS.

194
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:02,800
THEY BOTCHED THE PARIS CLIMATE

195
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,768
DEAL, TPP.

196
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:05,369
THEY BOTCHED PRETTY MUCH

197
00:06:05,369 --> 00:06:08,005
EVERYTHING THEY TOUCHED.

198
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:09,907
AND THEN TRUMP COMES IN TO TRY

199
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:11,975
TO BROKER A PEACE DEAL, GIVES UP

200
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:13,210
ALMOST NOTHING.

201
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,079
THE SAME PEOPLE THAT PRAISED

202
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,814
OBAMA NOW ARE COMPLAINING.

203
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:19,016
CLINTON AND CARTER WENT OVER

204
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:19,983
THERE AND BUILT TWO NUCLEAR

205
00:06:19,983 --> 00:06:21,251
REACTORS CAN WE GIVE THEM

206
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:24,188
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

207
00:06:24,188 --> 00:06:27,157
WHAT HAPPENS JUST THE OTHER DAY?

208
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:28,826
I THINK OBAMA GAVE TRUMP KEYS TO

209
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:30,394
THE WHITE HOUSE AND SAID BY THE

210
00:06:30,394 --> 00:06:31,795
WAY, I'VE DONE NOTHING ON

211
00:06:31,795 --> 00:06:33,163
NORTH KOREA FOR EIGHT YEARS.

212
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,064
IT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM.

213
00:06:34,064 --> 00:06:35,365
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL

214
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:36,366
WITH IT.

215
00:06:36,366 --> 00:06:37,167
GOOD LUCK.

216
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:38,735
TRUMP TRIES TO BRING PEACE TO

217
00:06:38,735 --> 00:06:40,370
THE PENINSULA AND ALL HE HEARS

218
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,574
IS 100% NEGATIVITY.

219
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:46,810
IT DESTROYS THE MEDIA NARRATIVE

220
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,782
THAT THESE THIS BIG WARMONGER.

221
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:52,983
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A DONE DEAL.

222
00:06:52,983 --> 00:06:54,184
IT'S FAR FROM A DONE DEAL.

223
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:56,220
THERE IS POTENTIAL HERE FOR A

224
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,620
GREAT DEAL.

225
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,689
BUT THE DEPUTIES HAVE TO HANDLE

226
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,559
THE DETAILS NOW.

227
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:05,362
NO VERIFICATION, NO INSPECTIONS,

228
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:06,430
PHASEOUT IS UP IN THE AIR.

229
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,265
WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING

230
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:09,399
TO DESTROY THESE FACILITIES.

231
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:11,168
IT HAS TO BE HAMMERED OUT.

232
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:13,036
THE SPIRIT OF THE SUMMIT WAS

233
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,404
VERY STRONG IN THE POLITICAL

234
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:15,172
WILL BETWEEN THE TWO LEADERS

235
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:18,976
APPEARS TO BE VERY POSITIVE.

236
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:21,311
I THINK NOW WE LET THE LITTLE

237
00:07:21,311 --> 00:07:22,012
GUYS HAMMER IT OUT AND WE WILL

238
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:25,949
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

239
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,417
>> Kimberly: JUAN, THE

240
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:28,185
PRESIDENT USE RHETORIC THAT SOME

241
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:30,954
THOUGHT WAS INFLAMMATORY BUT HE

242
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:32,456
WAS SPECIFIC IN SAYING HE FEELS

243
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:35,325
IT PLAYED A PART IN TERMS OF

244
00:07:35,325 --> 00:07:36,026
BRINGING NORTH KOREA TO THE

245
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:40,564
TABLE WERE ULTIMATELY HE USED

246
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:41,965
DIPLOMACY TO ACHIEVE THESE ENDS.

247
00:07:41,965 --> 00:07:42,766
>> Juan: I READ IT

248
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:43,367
DIFFERENTLY.

249
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,169
I THINK HE SAID HE REGRETTED

250
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,470
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE HE IS USED

251
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:46,870
IN THE PAST.

252
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,971
>> Kimberly: HE SAID HE

253
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:48,906
THOUGHT IT WAS HELPFUL GETTING

254
00:07:48,906 --> 00:07:50,207
TO THIS POINT.

255
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:51,775
>> Juan: I THINK HE SAID HE

256
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,043
REGRETTED IT AND UNDERSTOOD IT

257
00:07:53,043 --> 00:07:54,244
WAS PROVOCATIVE LANGUAGE, IS

258
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:55,379
WHAT HE SAID.

259
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:56,480
TO THE LARGER POINT, I THINK THE

260
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,449
BIG NEWS TODAY IS YOU KNOW WHAT,

261
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:02,019
THE PENTAGON DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS

262
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,520
OFFERING TO GIVE UP MILITARY

263
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,155
EXERCISES WITH THE

264
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:05,589
SOUTH KOREANS.

265
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:06,690
MAYBE MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE

266
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,825
SOUTH KOREANS DIDN'T KNOW IT.

267
00:08:08,825 --> 00:08:09,593
THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE PLAYED A

268
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:10,460
KEY ROLE IN TRYING TO MAKE THIS

269
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,796
DEAL HAPPEN.

270
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:13,697
THEY ARE SURPRISED TOO.

271
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:18,235
WHAT YOU HAVE IS KIND OF

272
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:19,903
SEAT-OF-THE-PANTS DONALD TRUMP

273
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:21,605
THINK THIS WILL WORK, THIS WILL

274
00:08:21,605 --> 00:08:22,406
WORK.

275
00:08:22,406 --> 00:08:23,707
WHAT ABOUT THE ALLIES?

276
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,075
THIS IS SOMETHING, WHEN YOU

277
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:27,411
THINK ABOUT IT, YOU SAY AS

278
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:29,279
EVERYONE ELSE ON THE PANEL HAS

279
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,714
TALKED ABOUT, LET'S GO BACK AND

280
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:32,015
LOOK AT PAST CRITICISM OF

281
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:33,417
SOMETHING LIKE THE IRAN DEAL.

282
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:34,384
OH, MY GOSH.

283
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:37,421
AT THAT POINT, IT WAS SAID THIS

284
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:39,990
WOULD EVIDENCE OF OBAMA'S

285
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,993
INEXPERIENCE, THAT HE WAS A

286
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:43,760
CELEBRITY PRESIDENT AND DIDN'T

287
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,494
UNDERSTAND THE THREATS THE WORLD

288
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:44,795
FACE.

289
00:08:44,795 --> 00:08:47,097
HE GOT A DEAL THAT STOPPED IRAN

290
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:48,265
FROM DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

291
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:50,801
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS NO SUCH

292
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,804
THING FROM PRESIDENT -- NO

293
00:08:53,804 --> 00:08:54,771
GUARANTEE, NO METHOD OF

294
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:55,973
VERIFICATION.

295
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:58,375
NOBODY ON THE GROUND, NOR

296
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,042
ASSURANCES, NO DETAILS.

297
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,444
>> Jesse: IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS.

298
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:04,014
OBAMA HAD EIGHT YEARS.

299
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:06,383
>> Juan: THERE WAS A SIGNED

300
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:06,817
DEAL, JESSE.

301
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:10,988
THAT'S WHAT IT SAID.

302
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:13,523
NOTHING FROM THE NORTH KOREANS.

303
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:15,292
WHAT YOU GET IS WHEN OBAMA SAT

304
00:09:15,292 --> 00:09:18,195
DOWN AND SAID I THINK THIS IS

305
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,597
'07, HE SAID I'M WILLING TO MEET

306
00:09:20,597 --> 00:09:21,865
WITH PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT

307
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:23,800
REPRESSIVE REGIMES BECAUSE IT'S

308
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,568
AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD BRIDGES,

309
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:26,803
TO TALK.

310
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:28,005
OH, MY GOODNESS.

311
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,640
THE REPUBLICANS SAID WHAT'S HE

312
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,407
DOING?

313
00:09:30,407 --> 00:09:33,243
HE IS CODDLING OUR ENEMIES AND

314
00:09:33,243 --> 00:09:34,211
ALIENATING OUR ALLIES.

315
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,847
WHEN TRUMP DOES IT, OH, THIS IS

316
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:38,815
HISTORIC, AND THE AMERICAN MEDIA

317
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:39,383
IS THE ENEMY.

318
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:41,985
TALK ABOUT HYPOCRISY.

319
00:09:41,985 --> 00:09:45,756
>> Jesse: I THINK WE HAVE A

320
00:09:45,756 --> 00:09:47,357
STRONG, MUSCULAR, PRO-AMERICAN

321
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:48,125
PRESIDENT LIKE DONALD TRUMP WHEN

322
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,693
HE IS WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND

323
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,361
TALK TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES.

324
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:53,563
THERE IS A DIFFERENT POSTURE

325
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:54,398
THERE.

326
00:09:54,398 --> 00:09:55,299
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

327
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:57,167
SOMEONE LIKE THAT AND SOME ELECT

328
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,770
OBAMA WHO DID AN APOLOGY TOUR,

329
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,405
TALKED DOWN AMERICAN GREATNESS

330
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:02,572
IN AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM.

331
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:04,641
AND HIS WILLING TO GO AND TALK

332
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:07,377
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUT

333
00:10:07,377 --> 00:10:07,744
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUA

334
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:07,778
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUG

335
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:07,811
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUE

336
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:07,844
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUT

337
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:07,978

339
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:08,045
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUG

00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:08,078
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUL

341
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:08,111
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUN

342
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:08,345
TO AMERICA'S ENEMIES AND NOT CUT

343
00:10:08,345 --> 00:10:08,645
DEAL.

344
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:12,582
THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE.

345
00:10:12,582 --> 00:10:14,618
>> Kimberly: DOING AN APOLOGY

346
00:10:14,618 --> 00:10:14,918
TOUR.

347
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:21,625
>> Juan: THE WASTE       WAY YOU

348
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:21,658
>> Juan: THE WASTE       WAY YOS

349
00:10:21,658 --> 00:10:21,692
>> Juan: THE WASTE       WAY YOE

350
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:21,725

>> Juan: THE WASTE       WAY YO

352
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:21,992
>> Juan: THE WASTE       WAY YOS

353
00:10:21,992 --> 00:10:23,393
ITS TEAM SPORTS.

354
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:27,364
I THINK LET'S GET AWAY FROM IT.

355
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,499
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A MOMENT

356
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,435
AGO.

357
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:37,240
130,000 PEOPLE LIVING IN GULAGS.

358
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,876
OUR TOUGH, STRONG PRESIDENT.

359
00:10:39,876 --> 00:10:41,611
>> Kimberly: WHAT DO YOU

360
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:42,979
EXPECT IN 48 HOURS?

361
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:43,780
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

362
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,215
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD

363
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,983
COMPLAIN ABOUT SOMETHING THAT

364
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:48,218
HAPPENED THAT WAS VERY FAVORABLE

365
00:10:48,218 --> 00:10:49,820
FOR THIS COUNTRY, FOR

366
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,455
NORTH KOREANS IN SOUTH KOREANS,

367
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:52,789
THE WORLD IN GENERAL, GIVE A

368
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:55,959
CHANCE FOR THIS TO WORK.

369
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:57,427
YOU DON'T LIKE IT IF WE GO TO

370
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:57,694
WAR.

371
00:10:57,694 --> 00:10:59,996
YOU DON'T LIKE IT IF WE SIT DOWN

372
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:01,198
AND ENGAGE IN DIPLOMATIC

373
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:01,565
RELATIONS.

374
00:11:01,565 --> 00:11:03,800
>> Juan: OF COURSE I DO.

375
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,569
>> Dana: IF YOU ARE SKEPTICAL

376
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:07,604
OF ALL OF THIS AND YOU ARE

377
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:08,338
LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY THEY MIGHT

378
00:11:08,338 --> 00:11:09,573
BE ABLE TO LOOK TO THAT YOU

379
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:11,575
RESPECT AND TRUST THAT IS NOT A

380
00:11:11,575 --> 00:11:14,177
PARTISAN BUT IS AN EXPERT IN THE

381
00:11:14,177 --> 00:11:16,480
REGION, VICTOR CHA IS A

382
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,815
GEORGETOWN PROFESSOR.

383
00:11:18,815 --> 00:11:21,318
HE WAS GOING TO BE

384
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:22,052
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AMBASSADOR TO

385
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:22,452
SOUTH KOREA.

386
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:24,154
IT DIDN'T END UP WORKING OUT.

387
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,122
IF YOU READ HIS OP-ED IN

388
00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:28,792
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" TODAY, HE'S

389
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:29,793
PRETTY UPBEAT.

390
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:30,827
HE LIKES THE STRATEGY.

391
00:11:30,827 --> 00:11:32,062
HE THINKS IT'S HEADED IN THE

392
00:11:32,062 --> 00:11:32,796
RIGHT DIRECTION.

393
00:11:32,796 --> 00:11:34,831
OF COURSE THERE'S A LIST OF THE

394
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:35,599
COMPLICATED QUESTIONS THAT HAVE

395
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:39,169
YET TO BE ANSWERED.

396
00:11:39,169 --> 00:11:39,970
OVERALL HE'S QUITE UPBEAT AND

397
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,572
POSITIVE.

398
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,307
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

399
00:11:44,307 --> 00:11:46,343
WHO IS NOT PARTISAN COME HE'S A

400
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:46,977
GOOD ONE.

401
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:48,845
>> Jesse: IT'S NOT TOTALLY

402
00:11:48,845 --> 00:11:49,579
TRAVEL WITH ME, JUAN.

403
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:53,049
I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT

404
00:11:53,049 --> 00:11:53,784
SUSPENDING THE WAR GAMES OR

405
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:54,418
MILITARY READINESS.

406
00:11:54,418 --> 00:11:56,153
I THINK YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED

407
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:56,987
FOR THE NORTH KOREANS, AND

408
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,789
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THEM.

409
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,591
THEY ARE DEFENSIVE IN POSTURE.

410
00:12:01,591 --> 00:12:04,895
THEY SEE THEM AS OFFENSE OF, THE

411
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:06,997
NORTH KOREANS.

412
00:12:06,997 --> 00:12:08,298
WE WANT OUR ALLIES TO BE

413
00:12:08,298 --> 00:12:10,600
PREPARED AND ON POINT.

414
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,802
SO WE CAN RATCHET THOSE BACK UP

415
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,203
AT ANY TIME.

416
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:15,138
THE BIG ONE ISN'T UNTIL SPRING

417
00:12:15,138 --> 00:12:15,439
2019.

418
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,641
I UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DID IT IN

419
00:12:17,641 --> 00:12:18,375
ORDER TO ENCOURAGE GOOD WELFARE

420
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,378
BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M CRAZY

421
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:22,045
ABOUT HAPPENING.

422
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:24,381
I WANT TO THESE TO CONTINUE.

423
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:26,249
I THINK THEY ARE IMPORTANT VERY

424
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:27,184
>> Juan: WISE THE PRESIDENT

425
00:12:27,184 --> 00:12:29,786
THEN SAYING THAT KIM IS A FUNNY

426
00:12:29,786 --> 00:12:30,053
GUY?

427
00:12:30,053 --> 00:12:32,923
>> Jesse: WELL, HE IS FUNNY

428
00:12:32,923 --> 00:12:33,857
LOOKING.

429
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:36,626
>> Greg: I FIND IT INTERESTING

430
00:12:36,626 --> 00:12:38,695
THAT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE

431
00:12:38,695 --> 00:12:40,096
SPENT DECADES PLEADING FOR

432
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:41,398
DIALOGUE ARE NOW HAVING ONE

433
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:43,200
DELIVERED WITH A GIANT BOW.

434
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,035
I THINK THAT'S WHAT REALLY

435
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:47,270
HURTS.

436
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:48,472
LIBERALS HAVE BEEN PROMISING AND

437
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:51,475
CLAIMING IS THEIR EXPERTISE, AND

438
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:52,909
I THINK IT DISTURBS AND DESTROYS

439
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:55,378
THEIR SOUL TO SEE.

440
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:58,215
IT'S AMAZING TO ME TO SEE HOW

441
00:12:58,215 --> 00:13:00,217
MANY PEOPLE ARE AGAINST PEACE.

442
00:13:00,217 --> 00:13:02,519
RETURN TO THE ANALOGY OF

443
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:02,886
HOSTAGES.

444
00:13:02,886 --> 00:13:05,222
THERE ARE HOSTAGES IN THAT

445
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:05,922
COUNTRY, RIGHT?

446
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:08,024
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING IS

447
00:13:08,024 --> 00:13:09,526
NEGOTIATING WITH THE HOSTAGE

448
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:10,627
TAKER WHICH IS EXACTLY THE

449
00:13:10,627 --> 00:13:12,062
PROTOCOL THAT YOU DO.

450
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:14,397
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, YOU KNOW

451
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:18,468
THAT TRUMP GAVE THE HARD SELL.

452
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,604
YOU GO IN THERE AND RESCUE THE

453
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:20,971
HOSTAGES.

454
00:13:20,971 --> 00:13:23,373
THAT'S THE POINT.

455
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:24,374
RESCUING THE HOSTAGES MEANS THEY

456
00:13:24,374 --> 00:13:25,976
ARE GOING TO DIE.

457
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:28,578
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO

458
00:13:28,578 --> 00:13:29,579
IT.

459
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:32,015
I AM OPTIMISTIC ABOUT IT BECAUSE

460
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:36,786
I THINK TRUMP IS GETTING THE

461
00:13:36,786 --> 00:13:37,721
NORTH KOREAN REGIME TO THINK

462
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:43,493
PAST THE     SELL.

463
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:46,263
THE VIDEO IS BRILLIANT.

464
00:13:46,263 --> 00:13:52,802
HE GOT KIM INTO THE CAR.

465
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:54,604
THAT WAS THE CORVETTE.

466
00:13:54,604 --> 00:13:56,473
KIM GOT THE FEEL OF WHAT IT'S

467
00:13:56,473 --> 00:13:59,543
LIKE TO BE IN AN AMERICAN CAR,

468
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,244
FREEDOM.

469
00:14:01,244 --> 00:14:04,381
>> Kimberly: HE TOOK A LOOK

470
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:04,714
INSIDE.

471
00:14:04,714 --> 00:00:00,000
HE MADE THE POINT.
