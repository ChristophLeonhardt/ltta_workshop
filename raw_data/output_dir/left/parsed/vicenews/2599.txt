we are in Mogadishu the capital of
Somalia which is a word that's become
synonymous with war
what else about is trying to do is to
complete their morphing into a proper
gorilla force and they have done that
with some success since the beginning of
this year they've killed five members of
parliament and there were a number of
suicide bombings they've attacked the
presidential palace twice they've
attacked the High Court
once they've attacked the Parliament all
of that this year the fight is being
spearheaded by AMISOM which is a
grouping of African militaries that are
mandated by the United Nations to be
here also has gone through an evolution
involving from a nationalist movement
tomorrow our global jihadist movement
