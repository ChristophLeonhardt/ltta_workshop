>> THANK YOU, SARAH.
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO MADE A
VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT
REGARDING THE PRESIDENT'S
DECISION TO TERMINATE THE 1955
TREATY OF AMITY.
THE TREATY MADE A MOCKERY OF
WHAT THAT SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM,
AND MALIGNED BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT
THE MIDDLE EAST.
TODAY'S DECISION BY THE
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE
WAS A DEFEAT FOR     IRAN.
WE ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ICJ
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT HAS
NO JURISDICTION TO ISSUE ANY
ORDER WITH RESPECT TO SANCTIONS
OF THE UNITED STATES IMPOSES,
PROTECT ITS OWN ESSENTIAL
SECURITY UNDER THE TREATY.
INSTEAD, THE COURT ALLOWED IRAN
TO USE IT AS A FORM FOR
PROPAGANDA.
THE IRANIAN REGIME HAS
SYSTEMATICALLY PURSUIT POLICY OF
HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE
UNITED STATES THAT DEFAMES THE
CENTRAL PREMISE OF THE TREATY OF
AMITY.
THE REGIME CANNOT PRACTICE
ANIMOSITY IN ITS CONDUCT AND ASK
FOR IT AND AMITY UNDER
INTERNATIONAL LAW.
IN ADDITION TO THE TREATY OF
AMITY I AM ANNOUNCING THAT THE
PRESIDENT HAS DECIDED THAT THE
UNITED STATES WILL WITHDRAW FROM
THE OPTIONAL PROTOCOL AND
DISPUTE RESOLUTION TO THE VIENNA
CONVENTION ON DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS.
THIS IS IN CONNECTION WITH THE
CASE FROM THE SO-CALLED STATE OF
PALESTINE, NAMING THE
UNITED STATES AS A DEFENDANT.
I'D LIKE TO STRESS THAT THE
UNITED STATES REMAINS A PARTY TO
THE UNDERLYING VIENNA CONVENTION
ON DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND WE
EXPECT ALL OF THE PARTIES TO
ABIDE BY THEIR INTERNATIONAL
OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE
CONVENTION.
OUR ACTIONS TODAY ARE CONSISTENT
WITH THE DECISIONS PRESIDENT
REAGAN MADE IN THE 1980s IN
THE WAKE OF THE POLITICIZED
SUITS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES
BY NICARAGUA TO TERMINATE OUR
ACCEPTANCE OF THE OPTIONAL
COMPULSORY JURISDICTION OF THE
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE
UNDER ARTICLE 362 OF THE ICJ
STATUTE AND HIS DECISION TO
WITHDRAW FROM A BILATERAL TREATY
WITH NICARAGUA.
IT'S ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE
DECISION PRESIDENT BUSH MADE IN
2005 TO WITHDRAW FROM THE
OPTIONAL PROTOCOL TO THE VIENNA
CONVENTION FOLLOWING THE ICJ'S
INTERFERENCE IN OUR DOMESTIC
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
OUR ACTIONS TODAY DEAL WITH THE
TREATIES IN CURRENT LITIGATION
INVOLVING THE UNITED STATES
BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL COURT
OF JUSTICE.
GIVEN THIS HISTORY AND IRAN'S
ABUSE OF THE ICJ, WE WILL
COMMENCE A REVIEW OF ALL
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS THAT
MAY STILL EXPOSE THE
UNITED STATES TO PURPORTED
BINDING JURISDICTION DISPUTE
RESOLUTION IN THE INTERNATIONAL
