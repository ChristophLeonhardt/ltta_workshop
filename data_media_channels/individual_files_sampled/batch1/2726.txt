I would defy you to find a CEO who is more involved in every aspect of their business than Vince McMahon when as a ee w magazine Vince McMahon was reading every page of WWE magazine and was giving line edits on photo captions that's how important the messaging of whatever leaves that office is to the guy who owns a company it's certainly not just about being there at raw every week being at every Smackdown working with all the superstars on talent development and getting their ring psychology in order he's doing all of that in addition to attending media relations conference calls and signing off on pay-per-view promo poster artwork he's doing all of that stuff which is three jobs he's doing all of the kind of booking for the matches effectively signing off on all of that stuff and he's also calling up the editors at wwm and making sure that they get their story straight so he's extremely involved in every aspect of the business and he's certainly more than just a guy behind the scenes he's in front of the camera sometimes so he's around for sure
