1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,996
"I’m a spokesperson for the
democratic party.

2
00:00:01,996 --> 00:00:05,000
These are the values of the
American people.

3
00:00:05,967 --> 00:00:09,404
Well at least americans that
live in san francisco and new york."

4
00:00:09,404 --> 00:00:11,274
Oh goody, conservative humor.

5
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:12,408
You know, the best kind.

6
00:00:12,408 --> 00:00:15,144
I mean, look at all those
hilarious right wing comedians.

7
00:00:15,144 --> 00:00:18,382
"I publicly apologized to Hillary
Clinton for calling her a

8
00:00:18,382 --> 00:00:21,685
beezabub I meant to call her bellzabub."

9
00:00:21,685 --> 00:00:24,955
Well this video somehow went
viral and you all slid into me dm’s

10
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:27,392
asking I tear it limb from limb.

11
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,894
And you know us Scots can’t turn down a fight.

12
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:31,663
So alright, Amber, I’ll give it a listen.

13
00:00:31,663 --> 00:00:35,134
"We promote inclusion and 
acceptance. Peace and good will."

14
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:39,940
And right off the bat she’s throwing trust
fund-sized rocks in hedge fund-sized houses.

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,343
Because everybody knows the
party of morals never wavers from

16
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:45,078
their family values, right?

17
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:50,017
"The world saw a trump supporter do
exactly what Donald Trump called for."

18
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:54,156
"Trump supporters pushing a woman
out of yesterdays rally."

19
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:58,226
"You know what would solve the whole
thing at the border if they just start shooting.

20
00:00:58,226 --> 00:00:59,695
Only shoot a couple."

21
00:00:59,695 --> 00:01:02,966
Oh...well, I mean, that’s just the supporters -
at least Republican leaders don’t engage

22
00:01:02,966 --> 00:01:07,770
in any hateful rhetoric and I don’t know
always act with civility, right?

23
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,373
"Punch him in the face I’ll tell ya."

24
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:11,508
"Knock the crap out of them would ya seriously."

25
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:13,444
Well, maybe Alice comes alive in the second half?

26
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:17,048
"Republicans want to stop certain
people coming into this country.

27
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:20,719
They cite the infiltration of
gang violence or opioids or sex

28
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,390
trafficking as reasons to stop
illegal immigration.

29
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,893
But democrats accept these as the
natural consequence of opening

30
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:28,794
up our borders."

31
00:01:28,794 --> 00:01:33,533
Oh so we got the old ms:13 are all
immigrants play, that’s not racist at all.

32
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:36,370
Well if that’s the case then is
this all conservatives I mean if

33
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,240
we’re playing by the same rules
this seems pretty accurate right?

34
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,278
"Republicans are always pushing
religion in our faces we reject their bigotry.

35
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:45,447
Religious people are idiots.

36
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:49,685
Democrats would much rather you sacrifice
yourself on the alter of progressivism."

37
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:54,157
No it’s not that we hate religion, we’re 
just reluctant to accept lessons on

38
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:57,394
morality from ‘Christians’ who
worship the ground of a thrice

39
00:01:57,394 --> 00:02:00,331
married pussy grabber who raw
dogged an adult film star while

40
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:02,433
his wife and kid lay at home.

41
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,035
You know, just how Jesus intended.

42
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,004
But wait, isn’t islam a religion also?

43
00:02:06,004 --> 00:02:10,642
Well I strictly remember one party in
particular vilifying members of that religion.

44
00:02:10,642 --> 00:02:16,082
"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total
and complete shutdown of muslims

45
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:17,583
entering the United States."

46
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:20,821
But yeah it’s the left that are
intolerant of religion, got it.

47
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,190
"Democrats are the party of
the common people.

48
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,560
The poor and the marginalized.
The weak and defenseless."

49
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:37,306
Ok so you try to smear Dems for
embracing celebrity opinions, but

50
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:38,808
then use Kanye in your video.

51
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:42,612
Then you claim we shame people we 
don’t agree with, while also shaming

52
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:45,482
Kaepernick in the same video, a
celebrity you shamed because he

53
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,250
hurt your precious patriotic feelings.

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,154
Man, Selfownitis truly is a
conservative disease.

55
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:52,290
See ted cruz for reference.

56
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,992
And listen it’s not that we shame
anyone we disagree with, we just

57
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:58,330
disagree with things like
slavery was a choice that’s all.

58
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,566
"Democrats are the party of equality.

59
00:03:00,566 --> 00:03:03,870
So much so that we insist upon
unconditionally believing woman

60
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,474
and disbelieving men.
Because well feminism."

61
00:03:07,474 --> 00:03:11,145
Yeah, why believe women when a
measly 1 out of every 6 women in

62
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:14,215
America has been the victim of
an attempted or completed sexual assault.

63
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:19,955
I mean why listen to the voices of those 
who as of 1998 an estimated 17.7 million

64
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:22,190
have been victims of attempted
or completed rape.

65
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:26,762
I mean why it’s not like 82% of juvenile
victims are female, and 90% of

66
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:28,397
adult victims are female or anything.

67
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:30,399
No the real victim is men.

68
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:33,036
I mean if there’s one statistic you
should be concerned about is the

69
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,572
0.05% of false accusations.

70
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:38,509
Yeah, you wanna talk about
victims, what about the 0.05 %.

71
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:40,845
And while we are on the topic of
miniscule percentages being the

72
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,582
real victims, what about the 1%
- it’s not easy being that rich

73
00:03:44,582 --> 00:03:46,719
you know, Especially with all
the tax cuts republicans are

74
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,722
fighting for, do you know how
hard it is to spend that amount

75
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:50,389
of money?

76
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,258
Yeah that’s the real issue.
Yacht or ferrari.

77
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:53,359
F**k it get em both.

78
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,429
"Republicans want to take away
a women sacred rights to chose

79
00:03:56,429 --> 00:04:00,901
have her child decapitated within
her womb limb by limb with forceps.

80
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:04,572
Democrats celebrate the right
to violently kill your child because

81
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:06,374
we are compassionate."

82
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:09,044
Right because remember,
republicans are pro-life.

83
00:04:09,044 --> 00:04:11,547
They care about kids so much
they seperate them from their

84
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:14,483
family and lock em in cages,
just for their own protection.

85
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:17,153
And not only this, they care so
much about kids that they sought

86
00:04:17,153 --> 00:04:19,088
to cut funding to CHIP remember.

87
00:04:19,088 --> 00:04:23,060
Yeah that measly $15 billion that they
sought to cut from the program

88
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,430
that seeks to help those kids
they fight for inside the womb,

89
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,733
if they happen to born with that
little pre-existing condition thing.

90
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,771
So it’s all lives matter until they are 
born, then it’s your on your own kid.

91
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:36,041
And just incase you forgot, it’s not 
just the unborn they care for, it’s

92
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,343
ALL lives remember.

93
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,646
That’s why they are doing everything they
can to protect all lives by helping the

94
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:45,786
22 million lives living in poverty by
helping them get affordable healthcare right?

95
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,288
It’s not like the majority of 
the country wants it or anything?

96
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,890
Oh you don’t want to do that either.

97
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,394
Ok so when you meant all lives matter 
you really meant everyone except

98
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,731
black lives, immigrant lives,
children's lives, any lives but

99
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,166
white conservative lives right?

100
00:04:58,166 --> 00:05:00,703
Ok well I think that’s about
enough dismantling of

101
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:03,005
insufferable hypocrisy for today.

102
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:05,341
But i’m sure CRTV will be
back soon with some more

103
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:09,346
hilarity that will leaves us...
well thankful that the left

104
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:11,081
at least knows how to do humor at least.

105
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:11,948
Get wreck’d nerds.
