you recently wrote a superb column about the demise of greyhound in the West and while more people are driving cars these days and using discount airliners it appears that Greyhound was also burdened by just too much government regulation can you elaborate on that sure I mean I think it's interesting that JAGMAN Singh the NDP leader federally has called for funding for Greyhound to keep it going when what's nits is for the provincial governments that where it operates to all get out of the way of creative solutions so Greyhound is is by its own decision kind of married to big buses to that you know overbuilt terminals with with regular schedules etc etc etc so part of it is a business decision but part of it too is it provincial governments with the exception of Alberta which deregulated buses in 2011 most of the rest of the provinces that are affected by this pull out dictate to Greyhound that it must run certain routes that it must have certain buses that it can't abandon x and y village that it has to stop everywhere regardless of whether there's been a passenger there or not in the last 15 years so Greyhound has an awful lot of baggage to carry literally and figuratively and that's one of the big reasons why it's not profitable what's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra lavance show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
