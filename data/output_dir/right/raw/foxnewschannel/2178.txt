>> YOU ARE RIGHT BACK IN 2015

19
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:41,910
WHEN I FIRST STARTED FOCUSING ON

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,045
THAT CHART I MADE, I HAVE IT ON

21
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:47,115
MY CELL PHONE.

00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:48,049
THEY ARE STILL NOT INVESTIGATED.

YOU'RE NOT WRONG >> Sean: BUT

24
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,654
RUSSIA COLLUSION WHAT WAS WRONG

NEWS.

29
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,695
UNFORTUNATELY, IT HAS BECOME THE

30
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:05,333
BASIS OF THE INVESTIGATION.

31
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,535
MUELLER OWES US A REPORT SAYING

32
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:08,169
THE RUSSIA COLLUSION MEANS

00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,705
NOTHING, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

34
00:01:10,705 --> 00:01:11,439
IT MEANS THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,708
WAS UNNECESSARY.

36
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,910

00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,914
RELEVANT.

40
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:20,882
MEANWHILE, THE MAN IS TRYING TO

41
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:25,120
DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA, COME ON.

42
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,854
AND THEY WANT ME TO GO TO HIM

43
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:27,689
AND SAY LET'S TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF

44
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,724
TO GET YOU READY FOR A

45
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,292

47
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,696
PERSONAL FOR THOSE THAT ARE

00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:35,263
AFTER THE PRESIDENT.

49
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,131
>> OF COURSE IT HAS COME IT'S

50
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:38,733
TOTALLY PERSONAL.

51
00:01:38,733 --> 00:00:00,000
LOOK AT THE PRESS CORPS.
