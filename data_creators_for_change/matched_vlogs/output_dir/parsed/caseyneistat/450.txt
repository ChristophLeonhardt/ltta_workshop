Benz boat I thought they only made cars
but I guess they've got a boat
not sure what else the day holds okay is
this the most original name who come up
with Wolfgang it's the best one for the
first vote obviously
what is this what is this fire is the
gardener they maintain the garden then
they it's a controlled fire yeah
when they cut down the trees in the
birthing drive that is a controlled
brush fire not a forest fire
doesn't it kind of look like Tom Cruise
and risky business
car though yes

last night how tired are you right now
on I'm tired how many coffees did you
have this morning I had three shots of
espresso and one

ride in letting us fly in the
while we're here
look at these things just finish up
lunch I think we're gonna take out one
of those fancy Mercedes now I want the
AMG one the high-performance one I also
feel bad for Owen he was up literally
the entire night
I guess jet lag got the better of him so
now he's just like completely zonked out
I think this car right will wake him up
oh and you want to go for the car right
now
which one of these is mine
this one that's a kid thank you well you
sure you want to do this wolf yeah
yes I'm sure you're gonna have a good
time I'm gonna put on the roof now and
I'm okay there is a reason why I do not
own the sports car okay here we go
either a turn
a lot
careful the brakes are unreal in the
downshift not matter this road is like
there are no break down lanes is like an
inch wide
it really is in the corners on the other
side try to just like
like animals out here can you believe
what happens when you hit the gas oh my
god incredible
we figured out how to make the drive the
car drive itself look we're on the
highway the car is completely driving
itself right now it's steering my feet
are off the brakes and gas hands-free
straight chillin over here literally on
the freeway okay this is the cut this
car is the vloggers dream you still have
to pay attention but the car does do a
very nice job of driving see the
steering wheel watch it move look at
this no hands
taking a really quick break from driving
here going to the Super Mario
that means Supermarket French no that's
fine
god that is a pretty car huh yep is it
locked
yeah what are we getting in here
what do you get it what about free books
get some rebus for me so that's it I
think so it is 7 p.m. now we just got
back from a long drive I'm exhausted but
I promised Owen would go swim in the
water which apparently is freezing and
since we leave tomorrow morning now is
our only chance
so we are going to swim in the water
it's called a fur Nick Euler or Verne it
there oh and that water does not look
kosher for swimming in but I thought
what is a diamond is when it's on a
cable can we take this yes we are closer
yeah this is Christi
locked
now this is where you want to go for a
fuel dip
look at the way I work
you don't think this is too rough Owen
all right
okay
