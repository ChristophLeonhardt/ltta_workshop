ALL. I THINK MR. BUTLER IS REFERRING

INVESTIGATION. BUT OTHER TYPES OF OBSTRUCTION

58
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,969
BUT OTHER TYPES OF OBSTRUCTION IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEXT, IT

59
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:53,170
IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CONTEXT, IT WOULDN’T BE A STATUE FOR DONALD

60
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,106
WOULDN’T BE A STATUE FOR DONALD TRUMP ANYWAY, IT WOULD ONLY BE

61
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,842
TRUMP ANYWAY, IT WOULD ONLY BE WHETHER THE CONGRESS DECIDES

62
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,443
WHETHER THE CONGRESS DECIDES THAT’S AN ABUSE OF POWER.

63
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,778
THAT’S AN ABUSE OF POWER. >> AND WHETHER HE MADE IT MORE

COMPLETE HIS TASK. AND HIS STATEMENTS OF OPINION

67
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,185
AND HIS STATEMENTS OF OPINION DON’T MEASURE UP.

68
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,155
DON’T MEASURE UP. THE COURT, THE SUPREME COURT HAS

69
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:13,357
THE COURT, THE SUPREME COURT HAS TAKEN PAINS TO NARROW

70
00:02:13,368 --> 00:02:13,958
TAKEN PAINS TO NARROW OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

71
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:16,093
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. I WANT TO GET THIS IN QUICKLY, I

ENRON CASE, SECURED A CONVICTION, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

77
00:02:33,722 --> 00:02:35,279
CONVICTION, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR JOB, ARTHUR ANDERSON

78
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,616
LOST THEIR JOB, ARTHUR ANDERSON WAS DESTROYED AND THEN IT WAS

79
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:39,417
WAS DESTROYED AND THEN IT WAS REVERSED.

80
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,785
REVERSED. WEISSMAN WAS BEHIND OBSTRUCTION

81
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:41,185
WEISSMAN WAS BEHIND OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.

82
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,120

HE’S A PERSON WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING, AND IT WOULD BE A

94
00:03:02,584 --> 00:03:06,477
EVERYTHING, AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME TO BRING TRUMP DOWN WITH

00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:11,216
SHAME TO BRING TRUMP DOWN WITH RESPECT TO THIS SILLY PAYMENT OF

00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:30,869
EVERYTHING. DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF THERE

00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:32,170
DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF THERE WERE ANY FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN

00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,538
WERE ANY FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE HISTORY OF THE TRUMP

109
00:03:33,582 --> 00:03:35,240
THE HISTORY OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, WHICH MAY NOT BE

110
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,976
ORGANIZATION, WHICH MAY NOT BE FAIR FOR THE SDNY TO PURSUE ON A

111
00:03:37,986 --> 00:03:38,777
FAIR FOR THE SDNY TO PURSUE ON A CURRENT PRESIDENT.

112
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:39,945
CURRENT PRESIDENT. THAT’S A DEBATABLE QUESTION.

113
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,781
THAT’S A DEBATABLE QUESTION. BUT IF THERE WERE PROBLEMS, IF

114
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:45,450
BUT IF THERE WERE PROBLEMS, IF THERE WAS MONEY LAUNDERING,

ALLEN WEISSELBERG. HE’S MORE ON TOP OF THINGS THAN

123
00:04:05,414 --> 00:04:08,373
HE’S MORE ON TOP OF THINGS THAN ANYBODY IN THE ENTIRE

124
00:04:08,384 --> 00:04:10,809
ANYBODY IN THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE HE’S A

125
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:14,646
ORGANIZATION BECAUSE HE’S A DECENT GUY WHO DOES THE RIGHT

126
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:14,980

AND IT WOULD SURPRISE ME THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN COVERING UP FOR

131
00:04:29,438 --> 00:04:30,930

THEY ARE NOW IN SOME KIND OF DISPUTE OR AT ODDS?

139
00:04:38,814 --> 00:04:40,839
DISPUTE OR AT ODDS? >> THEY’RE IN A NEGATIVE

141
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:44,543
POSITION, AND SO IS THE GOVERNMENT, HOSTILE TO COHEN.

142
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,912
GOVERNMENT, HOSTILE TO COHEN. THE GOVERNMENT DOESN’T LIKE THE

THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT FURTHERS THE INTEREST OF COHEN.

171
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:38,097
FURTHERS THE INTEREST OF COHEN. COHEN SHOULD BE DOING WHATEVER

00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:41,100
COHEN SHOULD BE DOING WHATEVER HE’S DOING TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY.

173
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,168
HE’S DOING TO THE U.S. ATTORNEY. AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY SHOULD

174
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:43,769
AND THE U.S. ATTORNEY SHOULD DECIDE WHEN THINGS ARE TO BE

HE ACTUALLY PREPARED DONALD TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS.

252
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,753
TRUMP’S TAX RETURNS. WHEN YOU HAVE A TAX CASE OR A

00:09:06,485 --> 00:09:09,310
OR ARE YOU NOT ABLE TO SAY WHETHER WEISSELBERG WILL

WHETHER WEISSELBERG WILL ULTIMATELY BE LOYAL TO DONALD

282

SENSE HE THINKS HE WILL BE HONEST.

287
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:18,920
HONEST. WHEN YOU DEAL WITH NUMBERS LIKE

WHEN YOU DEAL WITH NUMBERS LIKE THIS, AND YOU DEAL WITH

HE MAY KNOW THINGS THAT HE DOESN’T EVEN REALIZE WOULD BE

DAMAGING TO DONALD TRUMP. >> RIGHT, THAT IF HE JUST WALKS

I MEAN, THE PROBLEM THAT I THINK LANNY DAVIS HAD, AND MICHAEL

304
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:49,517
LANNY DAVIS HAD, AND MICHAEL COHEN HAD, WAS THAT RUDY

305
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:50,752
COHEN HAD, WAS THAT RUDY GIULIANI WAS GOING OUT AND LYING

306
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:52,520
GIULIANI WAS GOING OUT AND LYING ABOUT WHAT WAS ON THAT TAPE.

307
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:55,457
ABOUT WHAT WAS ON THAT TAPE. HE WAS MISCHARACTERIZING THE

308
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:55,757
HE WAS MISCHARACTERIZING THE TAPE.

309
00:09:55,767 --> 00:09:56,725
TAPE. HE WAS SAYING THAT TRUMP WAS

310
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,026
HE WAS SAYING THAT TRUMP WAS SAYING THAT IT SHOULD BE IN

311
00:09:58,036 --> 00:09:58,860
SAYING THAT IT SHOULD BE IN CASH.

312
00:09:58,904 --> 00:10:00,228
CASH. ANYBODY LISTENING TO THAT -- NOT

00:10:00,272 --> 00:10:02,564
ANYBODY LISTENING TO THAT -- NOT TO USE CASH, BUT A CHECK.

314

ANY NORMAL PERSON LISTENING TO THAT TAPE IS GOING TO REALIZE

316
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:08,537
THAT TAPE IS GOING TO REALIZE THAT TRUMP WAS SUGGESTING CASH,

317
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,039
THAT TRUMP WAS SUGGESTING CASH, THAT IT WASN’T -- IT’S NOT

EXCULPATORY AS RUDY GIULIANI CLAIMED IT WAS.

320
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:16,378
CLAIMED IT WAS. IT SHOWS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD

321
00:10:16,421 --> 00:10:18,881
IT SHOWS THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD HIS STAFF LIE ABOUT THAT WHOLE

322
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:19,248
HIS STAFF LIE ABOUT THAT WHOLE INCIDENT.
