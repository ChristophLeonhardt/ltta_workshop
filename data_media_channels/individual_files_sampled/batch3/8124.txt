THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS NOW TAKING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST OMAROSA. AS SHE CONTINUES PLUGGING HER NEW BOOK, SHE IS NOW SAYING SHE HAS PLENTY OF TAPES AND OTHERS HAVE RECORDED USING A RACIAL SLUR. SHE ALSO SAID SHE'S BEEN APPROACHED BY ROBERT MUELLER'S TEAM ABOUT THE TAPES AND SHE WILL COOPERATE. COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT KELLY ON COSTS WAY IS BLASTING HER FOR IT DOES SEEM UNGRATEFUL TO GO AND RECORD PEOPLE IN A SITUATION ROOM. I SEE A LOT OF DEMOCRATS OUT THERE AND A NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS WHO ARE NOT EXACTLY PRO-TRUMP WORK BRO KELLYANNE CONWAY SAYING, HOLD SITUATION ROOM? PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. TO SAY THERE WERE NO TAPES OF THE APPRENTICE, I DON'T HAVE THAT WORD IN MY VOCABULARY AND NEVER HAD IT. SHE MADE IT UP. OMAROSA HAS ZERO CREDIBILITY WITH THE MEDIA BUT NOW THAT SHE SAID THAT ABOUT ME THEY WILL TALK TO HER. ANDY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE IT'S TROUBLE TROUBLESOME TO ME THAT THERE ARE NONDISCLOSURE CONTRACTS THAT YOU WANT NOT TO TALK ABOUT THINGS, YOU GET A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA. THOSE ARE SUNSHINE LAWS THAT APPLY TO THE GOVERNMENT INFORMATION ACT AND THE LIKE, WITH THE IDEA THAT WE WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO BE TRANSPARENT AND OF COURSE THOSE NEED TO BE PRIVILEGED AND PROTECTED. THE PRESUMPTION IN GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE TRANSPARENCY. I DON'T THINK THIS TRANSPARENCY SHOULD BE THAT YOU WILL CLAM UP. NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS WITH BRINGING RECORDING DEVICES INTO THE WEST WING. IS THERE A LEGAL LIABILITY FOR HER ON THAT FRONT? I THINK OF HER SECURITY CLEARANCE WERE, IF SHE HAD ONE, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE HAD ONE, IF THAT WEREN'T CONTINUING TO HER CLEARLY THAT WOULD BE YANKED. THIS KIND OF VIOLATION, YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR CLAIMANTS. WHETHER YOU WOULD BE PROSECUTED OR NOT WOULD DEPEND I THINK ON WHETHER THERE WAS ACTUALLY SOME KIND OF A TRANSMISSION OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION THAT GOT OUT THERE. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME TO HAVE HAPPEN TO, BUT THAT WOULD BE THE CONCERN. IT SEEMS NORMAL TO HAVE A NONDISCLOSURE. COMING FROM ENTERTAINMENT THAT SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE DO ESPECIALLY IF SHE'S DOING A SHOW AND SHE WAS ON THE SHOW, THAT SORT OF THING THAT YOU CAN GO WRITE A BOOK AFTERWARDS WHERE BUT AT THE SAME TIME AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM, SHE'S OUT THERE DOING THIS THING WHERE SHE APPARENTLY SIGNED A NONDISCLOSURE DOING IT. WHAT A TERRIBLE IDEA AND THIS CREDIBILITY. BUT WHY USE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE? THAT'S MY QUESTION FOR YOU, IS OMAROSA CREDIBLE? IT'S BECAUSE IT'S CLICKBAIT. AND IT'S GOING TO GET PEOPLE TO TUNE IN AND THEY WILL WATCH IT BECAUSE IT'S FALLACIOUS AND DIRTY AND PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO LIKE TRUMP LOVE TO HEAR THAT HE USED THAT WORD. THEN THE TAPE GOT LEAKED AND YOU THE SECURITY ISSUES ARE RAIL, AND IT DANA PERINO WROTE A WONDERFUL PIECE ABOUT HOW SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN WHEN SHE WAS IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE. NO ONE WILL RENUMBER THIS IN PRESIDENCY AND IS TOO IMPORTANT AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS THAT WILL LIVE ON FOREVER. SHE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF THAT WHEN SHE WENT IN THERE AND WAS RECORDING PEOPLE. HOLLYWOOD TAPE THEY MADE THEIR DECISION ABOUT THIS PERSON AND I DON'T LIKE A RECORDING OF HIM USING A RACIAL SLUR POST CHARLOTTESVILLE FOR INSTANCE MOVES THE NEEDLE AT ALL COME ELECTION DAY. IF THERE IS ONE, PLAY THE DARN THING. I'M SURE SHE NEEDS MORE TIME IN THE SPOTLIGHT. THE FACT THAT IF SHE SIGNED A NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT AND THEN LEVEL OF TRUST. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, SHE'S ABOUT SELLING BOOKS RIGHT NOW AND SHE WANTS TO GET ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA. IT MAKES FOR GREAT RATINGS. IF ONLY HE DIDN'T TWEET AND CALL HER A DOG. DOCS WILL START BARKING AT YOU IF YOU IGNORE LONG ENOUGH. I WANT TO GET ANDY BACK IN HERE. Andy: MELISSA, YOUR POINT ABOUT THE TWEETS IS BIGGER THAN THIS PERSON. PRESIDENT DECIDED AT A CERTAIN POINT TO HAVE A STRATEGY OF ATTACK RATHER THAN, AS A AND EVERY DAY READ THAT I HAD NO HONOR, THAT I WAS RUNNING A HOAX OR RUNNING A WITCH HUNT, THAT WOULD BE THERE'S GOING TO COME A DAY, WHERE MUELLER IS GOING TO WRITE A REPORT. IF IT WERE ME, IT WOULD BE TO REPORT TO END ALL REPORTS. IT WOULD BE EXACTING AND EVERY SINGLE THING I COULD COME UP WITH TO CORROBORATE WHATEVER BAD STUFF I PUT IN THE REPORT. Melissa: YOU MEAN USING THE TWEETS. I WOULD HOPE HE WOULD GO AND
