it was pretty much a full house at Canada Christian college to see freedom fighter Pamela Geller the other night but outside the venue the usual suspects staged a pathetic little protest just whether you see the highlight or rather the low-light real even though there's been a fatwa issued on pamela geller and that one adherent of the religion of peace has been sentenced to 28 years for hoping to behead miss Geller it's a no brainer to say that Pamela Geller generates visceral hatred from certain followers of Islam and members of the progressive left her crime she has the temerity to venture off the reserve a political correctness by red flagging the dangers of Islamism so it was that at her Toronto appearance the malcontents were there to protest Geller's visit it made for a spectacle of stupidity things got off to a very anti-climatic start about two hours before her Geller was scheduled to speak one solitary lonely protester stood in the cold not saying or doing very much I went over to speak with them and what emerged was almost a script lifted from Monty Python because he couldn't cite an example of hatred uttered by Pamela Geller and even more bizarre he couldn't remember the name of the protest group that he belonged to I'm on my way somewhere else she said try to make it so I said sure you're part of many groups I guess right okay the other group is not a political so it's it's not an t5z remember can you tell us what it is I'm just waiting for if you can remember the name of this group and the leader please pass it on and see with me and I'll be okay now about an hour later about 30 protesters arrived most of whom seemed to be affiliated with public sector unions here's what one ringleader had to say what brings you out to this Pamela Geller event well I'm here basically because I think that it's completely inappropriate for racists for those who oppose immigration to be rallying in the middle of a community with lots of Muslims who live nearby so we stand solidly with the community in saying the racism the anti-immigration and timmikins bigotry is not welcome and sorry who is the racist here sir the speaker oh so pamela geller sir racist yes so can you tell me what she said that is racist I'm not I'm not I don't waste my time following what she said but I understand that this is a rallying point for a number of far-right groups who will be here today so that's why I do we tried getting some more insight from another protestor alas no dice so sir what brings you out today I'm a monkey okay I'll be a monkey's uncle you know it's amazing folks is that if you look at some of these signs of Toronto and York Region labor council OPSEU these are public sector trade unions these are basically publicly funded unions this is your tax dollars at work so what brings you out today to the we're not even real are you with the unions are carrying a sign with the Union logo on there's no other reason you're here for the Pamela Geller event you don't have to now since they were chanting anti hate slogans I asked one protestor how he felt about those imams and canadian mosques that have been outed for preaching death to infidels and jews what followed next might just be the interview of the year aussie again sir what about those imams that preach debt to infidels and jews do you have a problem with that finally when the silent treatment doesn't work that's when the progressive left employs white noise and interferes with the camerawork how mature this is what passes for civil debate you can answer the questions noise see folks when you try to have a civil discussion this is what passes for civil debate amongst the left just creating noise and blocking the camera lens how immature bottom line pamela geller haters next time you gather to protest a pamela geller event it would be kind of nice if you could actually explain in tangible terms what exactly it is that you're protesting if that's not too much to ask that is for the rebel media I'm David the men's ID Menzies like what you just saw then click subscribe below and never miss another rebel video you
