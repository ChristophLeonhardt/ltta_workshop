so Maxine Waters caused a bit of consternation when she encouraged her supporters to harass Trump cabinet officials and staff I wasn't especially consternated myself is consternated a word yeah it's it's one of those words it sounds like it isn't a word but I think it is word I wasn't especially consternated myself because I expect nothing but bile and nonsense to spew from the mouth of one Maxine Waters although this I admit was several steps beyond the normal bile that you expect from her and it was truly dangerous and this story along with or this rant of waters that along with the thing that prompted it which of course is Sarah Sanders getting kicked out of a restaurant in Virginia seems to have sparked renewed discussion about the possibility that we could be headed into a civil war in this country now I don't personally think that Sarah Sanders being interrupted in the midst of her cheese plate is the kind of thing that would normally spark a civil war it would certainly be the weirdest civil war of all time if that's what it was fought over but I do think that it's symptomatic it is just one really faint in itself insignificant symptom of something and there have been many other symptoms oh the rnc and I don't usually say this about the rnc about really anything the RNC does but the RNC released a truly devastatingly effective ad yesterday that kind of compiles some of the dangerous rhetoric we've seen from the left recently we roll that ad actually we roll it no we can't roll it I don't in fact I'm not talking to anyone there's nobody over there I'm just just my webcam so I can't roll and he adds for you but after this you can go on youtube and watch it yourself it is an effective ed and it all kind of shows that something-something not good his is happening in America and we're headed to well I won't say we're headed to a civil war as I've argued before I don't see a civil war on the horizon for this one single reason our saving grace is that we are we're far too lazy and apathetic to actually fight a civil war because that requires effort you know that requires requires you to get off your couch and stop watching Netflix and put down the Twitter for a second and so I just you can't fight an actual civil war with means as what I'm saying so that's why III don't I don't think we quite have the Constitution the personal Constitution the spine the motivation to actually go out and fight us if a civil war but we could very well be headed to turmoil of some kind to anarchy honestly we already live in a country of moral Anarchy and I think we could see that anarchy bleed out into the streets it already has I think the situation we could be headed to is it was was already already got kind of a preview of it a few years ago with all those riots that broke out in Ferguson and Baltimore and other places I think we could see a lot of that happening across the country all at once maybe that's what our civil war would look like it is in other words it's clear that we're sitting on a powder keg and in fact worse than that I would say we're sitting on five powder kegs all at once and if they all blow at the same time then then I don't know what happens but it won't be good so let's go through let's look at the powder kegs that we're sort of cultural powder kegs just so we understand the situation in our culture the first one is is is one that I've talked about many times we have nothing in common with each other in this country there is no unifying principle no unifying idea or characteristic we simply have nothing in common and that's a big problem in in any country it's especially a problem in our country because our country was founded upon an idea our country was founded much more like a religion than a country because it was founded on a doctrine we have founding doctrines we have a national Dogma most countries don't have that they may have their own doctrines their own ideas but those developed over time while the country already existed for us it was different it was like this is what we believed and now we're gonna form a country around it so as I've asked in the past what happens when a large portion of the country no longer believes in that idea well you can't really have a country anymore now if everybody were to to abandon those founding ideas and then coalesce around some other idea well then you could have a country it wouldn't be the United States of America anymore it wouldn't be an American country it wouldn't be a country that I wanted to live in but it would be a country in some sort of country but for us we just have no country because we have nothing in common we have no there's no underlying thing tying us together we don't even share a common language anymore we don't share anything the things that we share are the most materialistic and superficial kinds of things like we all you know it's it's it's it's about you know it is we share the same brands okay we all like Apple and we drink Starbucks and we watching Marvel movies that's what we have in common but that is not enough to make a country that's enough to make a brand that's enough to sustain sustain a company but a country is not supposed to be a company it's supposed to be a country and it's and so it requires something deeper to tie everybody together it's not enough this is why all this talk about people say to me all the time they say well why are you being so divisive what let's be unifying let's talk about what unites us ok great well then tell me what the thing is that unites us and I'll talk about it go ahead let me know because I what is it you want me to talk about the things that unite us ok what anything there's nothing we don't have the so so it sounds really nice to say let's be united let's let's all unify you have to unify around something you can't just unify for the sake of unifying and that requires some kind of commonality so here's the problem if I were to open my door and invite a radical leftist in which I would certainly have no problem doing we could sit down get a beer and talk but the issue is that the radical leftist and there's really no distinction between a radical leftist and a non radical there's billions no such thing as a non radical leftist anymore so the leftist you know they live in a world or this left this hypothetical leftist who's coming to my house and is sharing a beer he lives in a world where there is no God there is no objective morality the institution of the family is patriarchal and oppressive marriage doesn't matter or it doesn't really exist honestly babies aren't people there is no bio there's no that the biological differences between men and women don't exist or don't matter there is no real difference between men and women the history of our country is shameful and we need to apologize for it America is fundamentally an evil country the West is fundamentally evil okay and in honoring honor that's the world he lives in where's the unity what am i I have nothing in common with this guy that doesn't yes I can be polite to him I can be nice I can be I can be decent towards him I can even be civil most of the time it's a little bit difficult time but I can even be civil but if you ask me to unite with them well I just I literally can't do that because there's nothing there there is a great vast chasm that separates me from him and there is simply no way to bridge it there is no bridge that will connect those two sides we live in two different universes we have different ideas about literally everything there is nothing there is no there is nothing at all to unify around so it's just not helpful this is the problem there are people who you know they want to be the good guys so they want to talk about let's let's tell it to stop with the divisiveness let's unite okay shut up with that for a second and tell me what were uniting around and if you can't tell me that then stop talking about unity and admit that there can't be any so that's the first problem the first powder-keg the second Powder Keg is that many of us were raised in unstable or broken or emotionally chaotic families and that links to the third Powder Keg which is that vests have had no real moral formation to speak of traditionally typically a person is morally formed and that is it that's a process that needs to happen it needs to be an active process you can't just throw somebody out there into the world and say hey figure it out well you need to do from with someone from a very young age is morally form them is to teach them right from wrong and how to live as a decent person so traditionally where do you look for that well first you look to the family well not first but together you look to the family the domestic church and you also look to the church the Christchurch okay so you look to look to religion and you look to the family to morally form people well there's a big problem here because a great many of us have fled from religion we fled from the church and we come from broken families so where are we going for moral formation who is helping us from a young age who is helping to shape us into moral and decent people nobody we're just a lot of people just been left to kind of figure it out for themselves and they haven't figured it out unfortunately and understandably without the church without religion without a family then where do you look you end up looking to TV you look to the media with the Hollywood god forbid you look to academia even worse than that god forbid you look to the government and politicians well you're not gonna find it anywhere they're all you're gonna find is moral corruption insanity confusion manipulation you're not going to find its firm formation so those are two and three the fourth powder keg is that we have been desensitized and a big part of this without moral formation that's makes us susceptible to the desensitization and then on top of that we sit around watching screens all day we watch TV we we sit in front of screens for like 10 hours a day without exaggeration 10 hours a day watching TV or on our phones on the Internet and so there's this kind of disconnect especially on the Internet there is this disconnect where you can engage with other people but without necessarily recognizing their humanity and that's why people are so nasty and disgusting to each other online and I know it's really easy to say well that's just the internet you know that's not the real world yeah people are people are horrible to each other online they say the worst kinds of things if you look at a if you look at a the comment section under a YouTube video if you go on Twitter or Facebook where or anywhere really on the Internet you're gonna find people treating each other just in the most atrocious ways imaginable but that's not the real world that's not how it is in the real world what are you talking about those are people saying those things what do you mean it's not the real world those aren't it's not a fantasy those aren't those aren't imaginary characters the person who's anonymously saying disgusting things online that's a person saying them that is a person revealing what is inside their own heart now the fact that that person will then can then put down the computer or put down the phone and go out into the real world and maybe if you encountered that person at the supermarket they would nod nicely to you and say hey how are you good morning and walk by you that doesn't prove that what's happening online isn't real and the fact you can have a polite exchange with that person in the real world doesn't prove that they're actually a decent person know if they act like a monster online then they're a monster the fact that they're polite in the real world just means honestly that they're cowards and that they don't have the guts to to to be that way when they're facing someone face to face but how they act online when when they're able to be anonymous and when they have that protection of the screen and when they're able to remove as I said the the kind of separate a person from their humanity and engage with a person as if they have no humanity you know how a person acts in that context really tells you everything you need to know about them and what's going on inside their soul if you have ever gone on a YouTube video and told someone to kill themselves well you're just a horrible person I mean deep inside you are just a horrible terrible person and I don't care how nice you are at work to your coworkers you're only nice because you're a wimp and you would never say that to their face but that's what's going on inside your heart and the internet breeds that kind of thing because it desensitizes us it numbs us and there's just this kind of filter the separation you where we're able to engage with other people and encounter things that are really horrible yet it doesn't affect us the same way that it would if we'd encountered those things in the real world and so again there's that it just has the effect of numbing us and then you add on top of that media movies TV video games everything else where we just typically we look to the most horrible that the darkest most violent things for entertainment and then that continues to numb us even more and then we get to the fifth powder keg after we've already you know we're already living in a country that's not United we have nothing in common many of us come from unstable families many of us have had no moral formation many of us are desensitized in them and then you get to now where now we're very vulnerable for this fifth step this fifth powder-keg which is the dishonesty and manipulation of the media and politicians and academia and basically all of our leading institutions the institutions that are that have taken on the responsibility of leading the culture and unfortunately they are all infested with dishonest manipulative people and we most of us are very susceptible and vulnerable to those dishonest and manipulative people because of the last four things that I mentioned those are the powder cakes what happens when they all blow up I don't know like I said I don't know exactly what can we do about it I mean how can we avoid this explosion how can we reclaim America how can we come right up to the precipice of disaster and then quickly swerve and go the opposite direction I don't know exactly but I do know one thing I've been saying this for a long time I know it's not what people want to hear because what people want is a quick kind of just snap your fingers switch on a light sort of solution and I don't have it I don't think that solution exists what I do know is we've gotten to this point as a culture over the course of generations so what does that tell me it tells me that if we're gonna go the other way and we're gonna solve these problems and we're going to have a real country again where we're actually where we are meaningfully United around something well it took us generations to get away from that point it's going to take us generations to get back to it so you and I we're not going to see more than likely what we're going to see is we're going to see things get worse we're not going to see the United America I'm sorry we just want because you can't wander that far away from it first for so long and then all of a sudden just know what never mind and then the entire culture says you know what let's just change and do this instead that doesn't happen I'm sorry it is a generational struggle which is going to require selflessness on our part we're we're saying you know what we're in for some rough times you and I but we need to start thinking about the future we need to start thinking about our kids and our grandkids how could we put them on a trajectory where they don't have to suffer through the same kinds of things how can we put them on a trajectory where maybe they can live in a real country because we don't and we want so that's what we need to work on is accept the fact that we have kind of made our bed culturally speaking and you and I we're gonna have to lay in it and it's not gonna be fun but I think generally over the course of generations maybe we can maybe there's light you know there at the end of that tunnel and that's going to require what we look at these five steps we kind of have to do the opposite with our own kids we've to get married form families have kids and do the opposite of all these things with them number one we have to give them real solid principles and ideas that can motivate them and also they can unite tours around those ideas number two we have to be a stable family number three we have to morally form our children number four we have to avoid we have to we have to do what we can to protect them from the desensitization that happens online and when you're obsessed with screens and everything else and then number five we do all that then maybe they won't be as vulnerable to the manipulation of politicians in the media and academia and so that's the solution where there is hope but it's further down on the horizon and we have to be willing to do the work to get there all right so it's not all doom and gloom I mean unfortunately there's a lot of doom and gloom before you get to the hope but you know we just we have to be willing to to suffer through it thanks for watching everybody thanks for listening Godspeed you
