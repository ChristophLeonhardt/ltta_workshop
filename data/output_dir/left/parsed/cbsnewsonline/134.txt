IT IS NOT OVER UNTIL IT IS OVER.
YOU GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF 
SEEING SUCCESS, BUT THE RESCUE 
IS NOT OVER UNTIL ALL OF THE 
PEOPLE ARE OUT OF THE CAVE, 
INCLUDING THE RESCUERS. 
THERE IS A WAY TO GO YET BUT IT 
IS REALLY GOOD NEWS THAT WE ARE 
SEEING PEOPLE COMING THROUGH 
THOSE DIFFICULT PASSAGES AND 
GETTING OUT OF THAT CAVE. 
I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE JUST TO 
BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL BECAUSE 
WE HAVE STILL GOT AN AWFUL LOT 
OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE GOT TO COME 
OUT OF THAT CAVE AND STILL YET 
TO SEE THE REMAINING MEMBERS OF 
THE TEAM TO COME THROUGH. 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF A 
RESCUE TEAM, AS I SAID EARLIER, 
THAT TOOK PLACE IN MEXICO CITY. 
HOW CLOSELY DOES THAT EVENT 
RESEMBLE WHAT WE ARE SEEING NOW 
IN THAILAND? 
>> I MEAN, IN SOME WAYS IT IS 
VERY SIMILAR. 
WE RESCUED A GROUP OF SIX 
CAVERS FROM A SIMILAR SITUATION 
AND THE BIG DIFFERENCE WAS THAT 
IT WAS PART OF A CONTINGENCY 
PLAN ALTHOUGH IT WAS A RESCUE. 
WE WERE AWARE THAT THE CAVE HAD 
FLOODED AND WE HAD A DAY TO -- 
BEFORE WE WENT IN THERE AND WE 
KNEW THAT IT HAD FLOODED SO WE 
HAD THE CAMP SET UP IN CASE OF 
EMERGENCY. 
WE HAVE LINES LAID OUT TO ALLOW 
THE PEOPLE TO COME OUT THROUGH 
THE CAVE. 
WE ALSO HAD RICK AND ANOTHER 
DIVER ON STANDBY IN THE UK 
SHOULD THAT HAPPEN. 
SO THE DIFFERENCE WAS THAT WE 
WERE SLIGHTLY MORE PREPARED 
BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT PARTICULAR 
CAVE FLOODED. 
>> THERE ARE SO MANY TEAMS FROM 
AROUND THE WORLD INVOLVED IN 
THIS. 
IN TERMS OF CAVE DIVING, WHERE 
DO YOU GO FIRST FOR EXPERTISE? 
>> WELL, THE OBVIOUS ANSWER FOR 
ME WAS RICK STANTON. 
WE KNEW THAT MAYBE 14 YEARS 
AGO. 
THE SITUATION HAS NOT REALLY 
CHANGED. 
THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD CAVE 
DIVERS ALL OVER THE WORLD. 
IT IS QUITE A CLOSE KNIT 
COMMUNITY. 
THERE IS A NEVER -- IS THERE A 
NUMBER THAT YOU CAN DIAL FOR A 
CAVE DIVER RESCUE? 
PROBABLY NOT. 
IT IS AN INTERESTING THOUGHT 
BUT IF YOU ARE CAVING AT THE 
LEVEL THAT WE WERE IN MEXICO, 
THERE WERE ENOUGH MEMBERS OF MY 
TEAM THAT UNDERSTOOD WHO TO 
CALL, AND WE ARRANGE THAT 
BEFORE 
>> WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT A 
PLAN, A DIVING PLAN, AND WHAT 
IS INVOLVED IN ONE OF THOSE? 
CAN YOU TAKE US THROUGH THAT? 
>> YEAH. 
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO 
KNOW THE CAVE IN DETAIL AND 
RICK WOULD HAVE DONE THAT WHEN 
HE FIRST MOVED TO FIND THE 
MEMBERS OF THE TEAM. 
BUT YOU WOULD NEED TO FIND HOW 
LONG YOU WERE SUBMERGED AND HOW 
COMPLEX THE CAVE SYSTEM IS. 
WE HAVE SEEN A LOT ON THE NEWS 
ABOUT HOW TIGHT IT WAS AND HOW 
DIFFICULT IT WAS BUT THAT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN A BIG PART OF THE 
PLAN. 
CAN YOU MOVE PEOPLE IN THERE? 
OF COURSE, THE OTHER THING THAT 
YOU HAVE GOT TO CONSIDER IS THE 
SAFETY OF THE RESCUER. 
IF YOU ARE MOVING SOMEBODY 
THROUGH AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE 
THAT WHO IS NOT USED TO IT, 
THEN IT IS DANGEROUS FOR THE 
RESCUER AS IT IS FOR THE PERSON 
BEING RESCUED, PARTICULARLY IF 
THAT PERSON STARTS TO PANIC. 
YOU KNOW? 
LOSES THE LINE OR, EVEN WORSE, 
GETS EVERYBODY DISORIENTATED. 
ALL OF THAT NEEDS TO BE 
CONSIDERED. 
YOU NEED TO TRAIN FOR IT. 
WE TRAINED ON THE FAR SIDE OF 
THIS. 
I HAVE NOT TRAINED THE MEMBERS 
OF THE TEAM THAT I HAD BEFORE 
WE WENT TO MEXICO. 
THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE TRAPPED. 
BEFORE WE GUIDE THEM THROUGH, 
WE TRAINED THEM IN THE CAVE, IN 
WATER, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY REACTED 
BEFORE WE EVEN CONSIDERED 
BRINGING THEM OUT, USING 
DIVING. 
SELECT JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 
VERY QUICKLY, WE ARE LOOKING AT 
SCENES -- AT THE SCENE OF THE 
RESCUERS WITH THOSE LIT 
HELMETS, WALKING AWAY AND AROUND
AT THE SITE ITSELF. 
A FEW MINUTES AGO, WE ALSO SAW 
A NUMBER OF AMBULANCES MOVING. 
AS FAR AS THE RESCUE IS, WHAT 
ARE THEY CARRYING? 
THEY HAVE GOT BAGS AND RED 
SWEATSHIRTS ON AS WELL? 
SOME OF THEM HAVE GOT THEIR 
TORCHES ON. 
JUST GOING BACK AGAIN TO WHAT 
YOU SAID, ABOUT TRAINING 
CHILDREN OR TRAINING PEOPLE 
BEFORE BRINGING THEM THROUGH 
AND COMPLETING THAT RESCUE, 
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU LOOK FOR? 
HOW ON EARTH DO YOU BEGIN A 
CRASH COURSE IN CAVE DIVING IN 
AN EMERGENCY SITUATION? 
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU HAVE TO 
PUT THEM  THE IDEA THAT THEY 
WILL BE MOVING THROUGH THE CAVE 
THROUGH AND YOU WILL FIND A 
SAFE PIECE OF WATER THAT IS NOT 
SUBMERGED, AND YOU PUT THEM 
UNDER THE WATER AND YOU SEE HOW 
THEY REACT. 
I MEAN, ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE 
PLANT IN MEXICO, WE HAD A DIVE 
LINE LAID ACROSS THE BASE OF 
THE CAVE WHICH EFFECTIVELY WHAT 
WE DID FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE 
RESCUED IS WE PUT AN AWFUL LOT 
OF WEIGHT ON THEM. 
THEY CRAWLED. 
THEY DID NOT SWIM. 
THEY CRAWLED AND THEY FOLLOWED 
THE ROPE OUT OF THE CAVE. 
THEY MAY HAVE USED THE SAME 
METHOD. 
THE MOMENT THAT YOU MAKE THEM 
NEUTRALLY BUOYANT, AND THAT 
MEANS THAT THEY CAN FLOAT 
AROUND, THEY ARE MORE DIFFICULT 
TO MANAGE. 
YOU MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT ON THE 
FAR SIDE. 
YOU PUT THEM IN EQUIPMENT. 
YOU SEE HOW THEY PERFORM IN 
THAT WATER. 
THEY ARE NOT DIVING STRAIGHT 
INTO THE UNKNOWN. 
THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING 
ON. 
THEY CAN SEE THAT THEY COULD BE 
LOOKED AFTER. 
YOU REASSURE THEM, OBVIOUSLY, 
WITH PRESENCE, BECAUSE YOU 
CANNOT TALK TO PEOPLE. 
THEY GET TO KNOW THAT, 
ACTUALLY, IT IS OKAY AND THEN 
ONCE YOU HAVE GOT THEIR TRUST, 
YOU CAN START TO BRING THEM 
OUT. 
IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT. 
>>> YEAH. 
TALKING ABOUT TRUST, HOW DO YOU 
COMMUNICATE WITH SOMEBODY THAT 
IS INEXPERIENCED ONCE THAT DIVE 
IS UNDERWAY? 
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T. 
YOU HAVE JUST GOT TO BE 
PRESENT. 
YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE YOUR HAND 
ON THEIR HEART OR THEIR HAND 
AND THEY HAVE GOT TO FEEL YOU 
BECAUSE THEY CERTAINLY WILL NOT 
BE ABLE TO SEE YOU IN THE MUDDY 
WATER. 
THEY MUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE 
THERE AND THEY MUST TRUST YOU. 
TO DEVELOP THAT TRUST IS VERY 
DIFFICULT IN THAT SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME. 
A SHORT DIVE IN PREPARATION 
BEFORE THEY ARE PUT INTO HARMS 
WAY MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR 
US. 
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THEY 
HAVE FOLLOWED A SIMILAR SORT OF 
PATH. 
>> ONCE YOU HAVE GOT THE PERSON 
OUT OF THE CAVE, OBVIOUSLY 
THESE BOYS HAVE BEEN IN THERE 
FOR NEARLY A FORTNIGHT. 
THERE WILL BE LIGHT 
SENSITIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE, IN 
THEIR EYES. 
WHAT SORT OF MEDICAL PLANS ARE 
PUT IN PLACE? 
WHAT DID YOU DO IN MEXICO? 
>> WELL, THE HUMAN BODY ADAPTS 
VERY QUICKLY. 
ACTUALLY, THE BIGGEST SHOT THAT 
THE PEOPLE IN OUR PARTY HAD WAS 
THE LEVEL OF INTEREST. 
THE WORLD IS INTERESTED IN WHAT 
HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. 
IT WAS NOT A MEDICAL THING. 
IT WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL THING TO 
KNOW THAT THEY WERE, IN OUR 
CASE, ON THE NEWS EVERY DAY FOR 
10 DAYS IN THE WESTERN WORLD. 
THAT WAS A BIG THING. 
THEY WERE SORT OF GOING, WHAT 
IS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT? 
THIS IS A PLAN THAT WE HAD 
ALREADY ENACTED. 
AND I SUSPECT THAT THE MEMBERS 
OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM WILL BE 
FEELING THE SAME. 
IT IS LIKE, WOW, THEY WILL BE 
AMAZED THAT THERE ARE SO MANY 
PEOPLE INVOLVED. 
THEY WILL BE AMAZED AT THE 
MILITARY AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE AROUND THAT CAVE OR IN 
THE VICINITY OF THAT CASE. 
REGARDING THE MEDICAL, I MEAN, 
IT IS JUST A CHECKUP. 
YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THEY ARE FIT AND HEALTHY AND 
THEY ARE YOUNG LADS, 
FOOTBALLERS, PROBABLY 
REASONABLY FIT. 
THEY PROBABLY NEED A GOOD MEAL 
AND CERTAIN AND SOME GOOD WATER 
AND REHYDRATION AND THEY WILL 
BE RIGHT AS RAIN. 
BUT PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY 
COPE WHEN THEY REALIZE HOW MUCH 
INTEREST THE WORLD HAS HAD IN 
THEIR SITUATION. 
>> WOULD SUMMITTED THAT HAS 
BEEN RESCUED UNDER SEARCH, SUCH 
CONDITIONS, NORMALLY HAVE 
PSYCHOLOGICAL IN PLACE, IS IT 
ADVISABLE? 
>> I DON'T NEVER PARTICULARLY 
WITH THE AGE OF THE YOUNGSTERS 
INVOLVED, IT IS SOMETHING THAT 
THEY WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT 
BECAUSE, OBVIOUSLY, THEY MIGHT 
HAVE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH 
CONFINED SPACES OR WATER. 
IF IT IS DONE IN A POSITIVE 
WAY, IF THEY HAVE GOT OUT AND 
ACTUALLY IT HAS NOT LED TO ANY 
SORT OF 
>> REPORTER:, THAT ACTUALLY, 
THEY WILL PROBABLY GET EVERY  
WHITE QUICKLY. 
MOST YOUNG PEOPLE I BELIEVE ARE 
PRETTY RESILIET. 
I SHOULD NOT THINK THAT THERE 
WILL BE LONG-TERM EFFECTS. 
>> JUST TO GO BACK VERY 
QUICKLY, YOU MENTIONED SOME OF 
THE TRAINING THAT TOOK PLACE 
AND EQUIPMENT. 
HOW HEAVY IS THAT EQUIPMENT? 
WOULD THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 
DRESSED IN PROPER WETSUITS? 
WOULD THEY NEED THAT? 
BECAUSE OF THE WATER? 
OR IS THE WATER QUITE WARM IN 
THAILAND CAVES? 
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE ACTUAL 
TEMPERATURE, BUT YOU WILL FIND 
THAT THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF 
A CAVE AND PROBABLY THAT WATER 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAVE IS THE 
AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF THE 
COUNTRY THAT YOU ARE IN. 
BEING IN THAILAND, I WOULD 
IMAGINE THAT THE WATER WOULD BE 
IN THE 20s, EARLY 20s, 21, 22 
DEGREES CELSIUS, AND YOU CAN DO 
PRETTY WELL WITHOUT A WETSUIT 
IN THAT TEMPERATURE. 
THE EQUIPMENT IS FAIRLY HEAVY. 
I'M SURE THAT THEY MANAGED THAT 
AND THEY MANAGED IT IN A WAY TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THE YOUNGSTERS 
MAY NOT HAVE CARRIED THE 
EQUIPMENT THEMSELVES OR, IF 
THEY DID, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN MANAGE. 
AS I SAID, IT IS REALLY 
ADVANTAGEOUS IN THAT SORT OF 
SITUATION THAT PEOPLE DO NOT 
ACTUALLY SWAM BECAUSE, IF THEY 
DO SWIM, THEY GET LOST, BUT IF 
THEY ARE HEAVY, YOU CAN PLACE 
THEM ON THE FLOOR AND THE DIVER 
KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE AND THE 
RESCUE DIVER CAN THEN MOVE 
AROUND THEM, AND THEY CANNOT 
ACTUALLY EASILY MOVE AWAY. 
THAT IS A REAL ADVANTAGE AND 
THEN YOU KNOW WHERE THE DIAPERS 
ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE UP TO. 
>> WE HEARD MENTION OF THE IDEA 
OF SEDATING, THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SEDATING THE BOYS TO CALM THEM 
DOWN. 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE 
EVER COME ACROSS IN CAVE DIVING 
OR THAT YOU HAVE HEARD OF IT A 
CAVE DIVING RESCUE? 
NO I HAVE NOT PERSONALLY. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
I SUSPECT ANYBODY THAT IS 
SEDATED IN ANY WAY NEEDS 
CAREFUL MANAGEMENT. 
I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE MIGHT 
HAVE SAID THAT, BUT OBVIOUSLY, 
THAT GIVES YOU AN ADDITIONAL 
PROBLEM BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE 
YOU GOT TO MONITOR THEM 
BREATHING AND THE REST OF IT 
BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO WORRY ABOUT 
THEM MEDICALLY AS WELL. 
IF YOU HAVE DONE IT IN THE 
RIGHT WAY. 
IT IS NOT ANYTHING THAT I HAVE 
THOUGHT OF OR SEEN BUT I CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE THINK IT 
MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. 
EXPECT OBVIOUSLY, WATER PUMPING 
AND DRILLING HAS BEEN GOING ON 
AROUND THIS SITE. 
WOULD THAT HAVE ADDED A LOT OF 
WEAKNESS TO THE MOUNTAIN RANGE 
AND THE CAVE SYSTEM? 
I PRESUME THAT SOME OF THE 
PUMPING WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE. 
WOULD YOU BE HAPPY AS A RESCUER 
TO GO TO THE SYSTEM LIKE THAT 
KNOWING THAT THAT HAD TAKEN 
PLACE? 
DOES THE WEAKNESS ADD A REAL 
RISK? 
>> NO. 
THE MOUNTAINS AND WHERE THE 
KIDS ARE -- IT IS ALL 
LIMESTONE. 
IT HAS BEEN THERE FOR HUNDREDS 
OF THOUSANDS IF NOT MILLIONS OF 
YEARS IN THE FORM THAT IT IS. 
IT IS NOT GOING TO FALL DOWN. 
IT IS NOT GOING TO BE AFFECTED 
BY DRILLING OR PUMPING, 
CERTAINLY NO MORE THAN WATER 
AFFECTING THE SYSTEM AND THAT 
NORMAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS 
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. 
NO. 
THAT WOULD NOT WORRY ME AT ALL. 
>> OKAY. 
IT HAS BEEN FASCINATING. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 
TIME. 
THANK YOU. 
>>> THANK YOU. 
>>> A LOT OF REACTION FROM 
AROUND THE WORLD TAKING PLACE, 
AND AS WE HEARD AND AS I SAID 
EARLIER, THIS IS AN 
INTERNATIONAL STORY, 
INTERNATIONAL RESCUE OPERATION, 
AND WE ARE HEARING FROM THE 
USA, FROM DONALD TRUMP THAT 
WILL BE VISITING THE UK NEXT 
WEEK. 
HE HAS TWEETED, SAYING THAT THE 
U.S. IS WORKING VERY CLOSELY 
WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND 
TO HELP GET ALL OF THE CHILDREN 
OUT OF THE CAVE AND TO SAFETY. 
VERY BRAVE AND TALENTED PEOPLE. 
I MUST ADD THAT THERE ARE OTHER 
COUNTRIES INVOLVED IN THE 
RESCUE INCLUDING THE UK, THE 
U.S., AND AUSTRALIA AND THE 
PEOPLE FROM THAILAND 
THEMSELVES, OF COURSE. 
YOU ARE WATCHING BBC NEWS. 
THE PICTURES THAT YOU SEE 
AOUND THE RESCUE SITE AT THE 
CAVE ENTRANCE. 
I SPOKE TO OUR CORRESPONDENT 
EARLIER WHO IS OUTSIDE OF THE 
HOSPITAL WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT 
THE BOYS WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
TO. 
>> Reporter: WE HAVE SEEN TWO 
AMBULANCES RACING INTO THE 
HOSPITAL. 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHO EXACTLY IS 
INSIDE THE  WE KNOW THAT THREE 
AMBULANCES LEFT THE CAVE 
COMPLEX, PROBABLY ABOUT AN HOUR 
AWAY FROM HERE. 
THEY RACED ALONG THE ROAD TO 
THIS POINT.  
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE BEST 
SOURCE AT THE MOMENT FOR WHAT 
IS HAPPENING IS PROBABLY THE 
THAI NAVY SEALS AND ON THEIR 
FACEBOOK PAGE, THEY HAVE BEEN 
PROVIDING REGULAR UPDATES AS TO 
WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. 
REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE THE 
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE 
CAVE AND THE ONES THAT HAVE 
BEEN TAKING VIDEOS AND POSTING 
IT OF THE BOYS THAT HAVE BEEN 
TRAPPED. 
THEY SAY THAT FOUR BOYS AT THIS 
STAGE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO 
SAFETY FROM THE CAVE COMPLEX AN 
HOUR FROM HERE. 
THAT IS THE WORD FROM THAT. 
LOTS OF OTHER REPORTS ARE 
WHIRLING AROUND AT THE MOMENT. 
WE CANNOT SAY FOR SURE IF THEY 
ARE ACCURATE BUT WHAT WE KNOW 
IS THAT THERE ARE TWO 
AMBULANCES HERE AND FOUR BOYS 
BROUGHT TO SAFETY ACCORDING TO 
THE UNIT, THE LEAD UNIT, WHICH 
HAS BEEN SPEARHEADING THIS 
OPERATION. 
>> WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY 
CONCERNS FOR THE CHILDREN'S 
HEALTH AS THEY ARE BROUGHT TO 
THE HOSPITAL? 
DO WE KNOW WHAT PLAN HAS BEEN 
PUT IN PLACE? 
>> Reporter:  WELCOMES 
OFFICIALS HERE, DOCTORS AND 
NURSES, HAVE NOT BEEN SPEAKING 
PUBLICLY ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE 
BEEN PLANNING BUT CLEARLY THEY 
HAVE HAD SOME TIME TO PREPARE 
FOR THIS. 
THEY KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE THEY 
NEED TO BE TREATING POTENTIALLY 
AND THAT EVER SINCE THE BOYS 
HAVE BEEN FOUND AT THE START OF 
LAST WEEK, THEY HAVE HAD A 
DOCTOR WITH THEM THAT HAS BEEN 
ABLE TO ASSESS THEIR MEDICAL 
CONDITION ON AN HOURLY BASIS. 
WE HEARD THE OFFICIALS IN THIS 
 
THAT THE BOYS WERE STRONG 
ENOUGH, MENTALLY FIT TO EMBARK 
ON THIS RESCUE ATTEMPT. 
CLEARLY A DECISION WAS MADE TO 
GO WITH HIS RELATIVE BREAK IN 
THE WEATHER, TO TRY TO EMBARK 
ON A SUCCESSFUL RESCUE. 
IN TERMS OF HOW THE INDIVIDUAL 
BOYS WOULD BE TREATED, WE HAVE 
NOT GOT THE INFORMATION AT THE 
MOMENT. 
CLEARLY THEY KNOW THE AGES OF 
THE BOYS, CONDITIONS OVER THE 
PAST WEEK OR SO, SO YOU WOULD 
IMAGINE THAT THERE IS A TAILOR-
MADE PLAN FOR EACH OF THESE 
YOUNG FOOTBALLERS AS HOPEFULLY 
THEY ALL EMERGED TO SAFETY AND 
THEY ARE TREATED HERE AND 
ULTIMATELY RENITED WITH THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
>> AND THE HELICOPTERS -- WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT THE HELICOPTERS 
HAD BEEN PUT ON STANDBY. 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE PLANS IN 
TERMS OF GETTING THE BOYS TO 
THE HOSPITAL AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE. 
WHY IS IT THAT THE THEY HAVE 
USED AMBULANCES? 
>> Reporter:  I THINK IT IS 
PROBABLY FOR THE MEDICAL TEAMS 
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING 
DYNAMIC RISK ASSESSMENTS AS 
THEY CALL IT BUT WE IMAGINE 
THAT THE BOYS WERE PROBABLY 
ASSESSED AFTER THE FIRST AND 
HARDEST PART OF THE RESCUE 
ATTEMPT. 
THAT WAS THE STUMBLING BLOCK. 
THE CAVES ARE SO NARROW, 
FLOODED IN PARTS, AND THEY WERE 
REALLY CONCERNED THAT THEY 
WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING THE BOYS 
SAFELY THROUGH THESE WINDING 
AND VERY NARROW PASSAGEWAYS AND 
CORRIDORS. 
THERE WERE PROBABLY ASSESSED 
AFTER THE FIRST POINT AND A 
DECISION MADE THAT THEY WOULD 
CONTINUE WITH THE REST OF THE 
RESCUE OPERATION. 
AS FOR HELICOPTERS, THEY ARE 
CLEARLY MUCH QUICKER BUT IF THE 
DECISION WAS MADE THAT BRINGING 
THEM HERE BY ROAD WAS THE BEST 
OPTION, THEY HAVE GONE WITH 
THAT. 
WE SAW A HELICOPTER TAKE OFF 
EARLY FROM THE SITE AND IT IS 
NOT CLEAR WHO WAS IN THAT AND 
WHAT ROLE HE WAS PLAYING.  
SMITH OKAY. 
THAT WAS DAN JOHNSON. 
WHAT WE CAN SEE IS THE LOCAL 
GOVERNOR OF THE PROVIDENCE. 
WE ARE GETTING A TRANSLATION TO 
FIND OUT THE LATEST, THE VERY 
LATEST, REGARDING THE RESCUE 
OPERATION. 
WHEN HE SAT DOWN AND STARTED 
SPIN, WE WERE ABLE TO HEAR 
CHEERING FROM THE PRESS 
GATHERED AT THIS PRESS 
CONFERENCE. 
SO AS SOON AS WE KNOW, IN TERMS 
OF NUMBERS AND THE STATUS OF 
THE RESCUE OPERATION, WE WILL 
UPDATE YOU. 
WHAT WE CAN TELL YOU IS THAT 19?
90. 
MY FAULT. 
90. 90 DIVERS ARE CURRENTLY 
INVOLVED IN THIS OPERATION. 
54 DIVERS AND 40 THAI DIAPERS. 
THEY ARE INVOLVED -- DIVERS 
INVOLVED IN RESCUING THESE FOUR 
BOYS AND THEIR COACH. 
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE CAVE 
SYSTEM FOR ALMOST A FORTNIGHT 
AND THEY WERE IN THERE FROM 
JUNE 23 AND THE LATEST 
CONFIRMATION THAT WE HEARD IS 
THAT FOUR OF THE BOYS HAD 
EXITED AND HAD MANAGED TO BE 
RESCUED FROM THE CAVE SYSTEM. 
WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT CONDITION 
THEY WERE IN WHEN THEY CAME OUT 
BUT WHAT WE CAN CONFIRM IS THAT 
PART OF THE MEDICAL PLAN THAT 
WAS PUT IN PLACE SHOWED THAT 
THOSE BOYS WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT 
IN AMBULANCES. 
WE SAW THE AMBULANCES LEAVING 
THE RESCUE SITE AND WE 
UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
TO THE LOCAL OR DISTRICT 
HOSPITAL AND IT IS ABOUT AN 
HOUR AWAY BY CAR. 
THEY ALSO HAVE THE OPTION OF 
USING HELICOPTERS. 
THERE WAS AN AMBULANCE FOR EACH 
BOY. 
A NUMBER OF HELICOPTERS WERE ON 
LOCATION AS WELL BUT THE 
WEATHER HINDERED THAT FOR THE 
HOSPITAL. 
THEY WERE TAKEN BY ROAD. 
WE UNDERSTAND, IN TERMS OF 
CHOOSING WHICH BOYS TO GET OUT 
OF THERE FIRST, THEY TOOK THE 
WEAKEST  OF THE BOYS. 
SO THE FIRST BOY REPORTEDLY 
LEFT THAT CAVE AT 5:40 PM LOCAL 
TIME. 
THE TIME NOW IS 8:50 PM. 
LET ME PUT THAT INTO THE LOCAL 
TIME BST. 
WE GOT THE NEWS OF THE FIRST 
RESCUE JUST AFTER 1:00 BRITISH 
SUMMERTIME. 
A LOT OF ANALYSTS ARE SAYING 
THAT THE RESCUE HAS ACTUALLY 
TAKEN PLACE A LOT FASTER THAN 
ANTICIPATED, A LOT FASTER THAN 
WE HAVE BEEN TOLD. 
WE EXPECTED THE FIRST OF THE 
BOYS TO BE BROUGHT OUT OF THERE 
BY 3 PM. 
THAT IS BRITISH SUMMERTIME. 
HERE WE GO. 
MORE AMBULANCES ARE MOVING 
AROUND THAT SITE. IN TERMS OF 
THE RESCUE SO, THOSE BOYS WOULD 
HAVE HAD TO TRAVEL UNDERWATER, 
DIVING, FOR ABOUT 1 KILOMETER. 
IT IS NOT ALL UNDERWATER BUT 
IT'S THE ROUTE THAT WAS 
TREACHEROUS THAT CAUSE THE MOST 
CONCERN BCAUSE, AT TIMES, THEY 
WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE SOME OF 
THAT IS -- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
THE DIVERS THEMSELVES BECAUSE 
THE BOYS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
ATTACHED TO THE EXPERT DIVERS 
BY A BREATHING LINE SO THE 
DIVERS WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE HAD 
TO WATCH THE BOYS TO ENSURE 
úTH 
PANIC, BECAUSE THAT IS THE 
GREATEST DANGER TO BRINGING THE 
BOYS OUT ALIVE, BUT THEY HAD TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THE AIR TANKS 
WERE PASSED THROUGH THE NARROW 
PASSAGES CAREFULLY. 
THE BOYS WERE BROUGHT THROUGH. 
THE AIR TANKS WERE REATTACHED. 
THE RESCUE WOULD HAVE CONTINUED.
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A COUPLE 
OF STOPS ALONG THE WAY WHERE 
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO 
WALK AND CHECKED OVER BEFORE 
THEY WOULD HAVE CONTINUED 
TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE OF THE 
CAVE ITSELF. 
GETTING IN THERE, SOME OF THE 
STATISTICS -- IT WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN AROUND 6 HOURS BUT 
REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE GOING IN 
THERE WITH A LOT OF EQUIPMENT. 
SO SIX HOURS FOR THE RESCUE 
TEAM TO GET IN, WALKING, 
SWIMMING AND DIVING AS WELL. 
THE ESTIMATION IS THAT IT WOULD 
TAKE ABOUT FIVE HOURS TO GET 
THE BOYS OUT. 
THE CONFIRMATION, IF YOU ARE 
JUST JOINING US ON BBC NEWS IS 
THAT FOUR OF THE 12 BOYS THAT 
HAVE BEEN TRAPPED IN THAT CAVE 
SYSTEM IN TIME WHEN CAVE IN 
NORTHERN THAILAND HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT OUT. 
I AM OPTIMISTIC AND I WILL SAY 
SAFELY BROUGHT OUT BUT WHAT WE 
DO KNOW IS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL AND RESCUE 
PLANS WERE PUT IN PLACE AND 
ALSO PLANS TO GET THOSE 
CHILDREN STRAIGHT TO A 
HOSPITAL. 
IN TERMS OF LOGISTICS AND 
RESCUE TEAM, INCREDIBLE 90 
DIVERS ARE PART OF THIS RESCUE 
TEAM. 
REMEMBER THAT YOU NEED THE 
DIVERS THEMSELVES. 
YOU NEED SUPPORT DIVERS AS WELL.
54 AND DIVERS ARE INVOLVED FROM 
AROUND THE WORLD. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TWEETED, 
SAYING THAT THE U.S. IS 
SUPPORTING THE EVENTS TAKING 
PLACE, THE RESCUE OPERATION IN 
THAILAND. 
40 LOCAL DIVERS ARE INVOLVED. 
IN TERMS OF MOVING ONTO THE 
NEXT STAGE OF THE RESCUE, THE 
RESCUE WORKERS, WE UNDERSTAND, 
WILL NEED UP TO 10 HOURS TO 
PREPARE FOR THE NEXT STAGE OF 
THIS OPERATION. 
SO THERE COULD BE A BREAK IN 
ADVANCE AND FURTHER NEWS COMING 
OUT BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT FROM 
ONE EXIT OF BOYS TO THE NEXT, A 
10 HOUR GAP IS NEEDED FOR THE 
RESCUE TEAM TO PREPARE BEFORE 
THEY CAN GO BACK IN TO BRING 
THE NEXT TEAM OF YOUNG BOYS 
OUT.

HELLO AND WELCOME TO BBC WORLD 
NEWS, REPORTS FROM NORTHERN 
THAILAND SAY THAT AT LEAST FOUR 
BOYS FROM THE GROUP TRAPPED 
INSDE THE FLOODED CAVE HAVE 
BEEN BROUGHT OUT. 
A MAJOR OPERATION INVOLVING 
INTERNATIONAL DIVERS AND ELITE 
MEMBERS OF THE THAILAND NAVY 
HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE TO FREE 
THE BOYS AND THEIR FOOTBALL 
COACH. 
THEY BECAME STRANDED A 
FORTNIGHT AGO WHEN THE TUNNELS 
WERE WATERLOGGED WITH RAIN. 
WE WILL SPEAK TO OUR 
CORRESPONDENT, NICK BEEK, WHO 
IS AT THE HOSPITAL, WHAT MORE 
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE 
POSITION OF THOSE BOYS? 
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE MAIN 
HOSPITAL IN THE REGION, IT IS 
ABOUT ONE HOUR BY CAR FROM THE 
CAVE COMPLEX WHERE THE BOYS 
HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM TODAY. 
FOUR BOYS. 
I AM JUST LOOKING NOW, THAT'S 
PROBABLY SOME MILITARY VEHICLE 
AND IN THE PAST 90 MINUTES OR 
SO WE HAVE SEEN TWO AMBULANCES 
ARRIVED HERE AND THE RAILINGS 
WERE MOVED AWAY AND AMBULANCES 
RACED THROUGH TO THE HOSPITAL. 
WE HAVE SEEN POLICE HELICOPTERS 
INVOLVED IN THE RESCUE FLYING 
OVERHEAD. 
YES, THE CRUCIAL INFORMATION TO 
GIVE YOU COMES FROM A PRESS 
CONFERENCE IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES, BUT ALSO FROM THE THAI 
NAVY SEALS,  THERE DIVERS HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED AND THEY SAY THAT 
FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT OUT 
NOW. 
AS FOR THEIR CONDITION, YOU 
ASKED ME THAT, WE DO NOT KNOW. 
CLEARLY THE TEAMS HAVE BEEN 
WAITING FOR THEIR ARRIVAL. 
IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ARE 
FARING, WE DO NOT KNOW AT THE 
MOMENT. 
>> IS THERE ANY IDEA WHAT KIND 
OF IMMEDIATE TREATMENT THEY 
COULD BE RECEIVING BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE NOT SEEN THE LIGHT, FOR 
EXAMPLE, FOR NUMBER OF DAYS? 
>> Reporter: THE THING TO 
REMEMBER IS THEY HAVE HAD A 
DOCTOR WITH THEM FOR NEARLY ONE 
WEEK. 
HER DOCTOR WAS ABLE TO GET 
THERE AND ASSESS THEM ON A 
DAILY BASIS. 
LAST NIGHT, THE FORMER GOVERNOR 
IN CHARGE OF THE RESCUE 
OPERATION SAID THAT THE BOYS 
WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO EMBARK ON 
THIS RESCUE ATTEMPT. 
CLEARLY A DECISION WAS MADE 
THERE. 
WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN SOME DETAIL 
FROM DOCTORS AND NURSES AND 
THEY SAY THERE IS A SPECIAL 
UNIT IN THE HOSPITAL SET ASIDE 
FOR THE BOYS. 
WE DON'T KNOW IF IT IS 
INDIVIDUAL CUBICLES, BUT 
CERTAINLY SPECIALIST TEAMS ON 
HAND WILL CARRY OUT THE BASIC 
OBSERVATIONAL CHECKS, BLOOD 
TESTS, URINE TESTS, OTHER 
NORMAL THINGS. 
THAT IS IF IT IS THE BEST 
OUTCOME IF ALL THE BOYS ARE 
ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE CAVES, 
WALK PART OF THE WAY, AND THEN 
BE BROUGHT HERE. 
CLEARLY, IF THERE IS MORE 
DIFFICULTY OR A WEAKENED 
CONDITION, THE SPECIALIST'S 
WILL HAVE A TOUGHER JOB, IN 
TERMS OF ANY TREATMENT GOING 
ON, THAT IS UNCLEAR.  
>> CERTAINLY REASSURING THAT 
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO THE 
HOSPITAL. 
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DEGREE 
OF RELIEF ON THE PART OF THE 
FAMILIES, ANY WORD FROM THEM? 
>> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW IF 
THE FAMILIES ARE HERE AT THE 
MOMENT, CERTAINLY FOR THE PAST 
TWO WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN THEM IN 
DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND THE 
CAVE COMPLEX. 
THEY HAVE BEEN IN THEIR OWN 
TUCKED AWAY AREA WHERE THEY 
HAVE BEEN KEPT UP TO DATE WITH 
THE LATEST INFORMATION. 
TODAY THEY WOULD'VE BEEN THE 
FIRST TO KNOW AND WOULD'VE BEEN 
GIVEN ALL OF THE UPDATES FROM 
THE DIVERS AND RESCUE TEAMS AS 
THEY STARTED THE OPERATION AND 
DECIDED TO CONTINUE. 
IT COULD BE THAT THE FAMILY 
MEMBERS ARE INSIDE NOW. 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE 
OR IF THEY HAVE SEEN THEIR 
LOVED ONES YET. 
CLEARLY, A DREADFUL ORDEAL, TWO 
WEEKS THEY HAVE HAD TO COPE 
WITH THIS. 
FIRST THERE WAS THE DREADFUL 
SENSATION OF NOT KNOWING WHAT 
HAD HAPPENED. 
FOR NINE DAYS THOSE BOYS WERE 
TRAPPED AND FINALLY THOSE TWO 
BRITISH AMATEUR DIVERS WERE 
ABLE TO LOCATE THEM AND TELL 
THE WORLD THAT THEY HAD BEEN 
FOUND. 
IN TERMS OF THE REACTION FROM 
THE FAMILIES, WE HAVE NOT BEEN 
THAT YET. 
THIS IS STILL IN THE EARLY 
DAYS, ONLY FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT TO SAFETY, 13 ARE IN 
THE PARTY, CLEARLY A LONG WAY 
TO GO.  
>> WE ARE WATCHING FOR 
DEVELOPMENTS CLOSELY. 
TAKING A STEP BACK, THIS REALLY 
HAS BROUGHT THE COUNTRY 
TOGETHER, HASN'T IT? WE HEAR 
ARE UTTERLY GRIPPED, I CAN ONLY 
IMAGINE HOW EMOTIONALLY CHARGED 
THINGS ARE THERE IN THAILAND? 
>> Reporter: THAILAND AS A 
NATION HAS BEEN PRAYING FOR THE 
BEST, FEARING THE WORST. IF YOU 
SPEAK WITH THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE 
HERE, THEY ARE AS ONE, THEY ARE 
SO DETERMINED THAT THESE BOYS 
SHOULD BE RESCUED. 
WE MET SOME OF THE WELL-WISHERS 
AND VOLUNTEERS AT THE SITE. 
THEY HAVE CREATED A COMMUNITY 
THERE OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS 
AND THE SENSE OF OPTIMISM WHEN 
THEY HEARD THAT THE BOYS HAVE 
BEEN LOCATED, THAT WAS 
INCREDIBLE, THERE WAS AN ENERGY 
WHICH FLOWED THROUGH THE SITE. 
IS SUSTAINED SO MANY PEOPLE 
THAT WERE WORKING EXTREMELY 
LONG SHIFTS. 
IF YOU LOOK IN THE EYES OF SOME 
OF THE RESCUERS AND DIVERS, 
THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY SHATTERED, 
BUT THEY SAID THEY WOULD KEEP 
GOING FOR AS LONG AS IT TAKES. 
CLEARLY, IF WE HAVE THE NEWS IN 
THE COMING HOURS THAT ALL OF 
THESE BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE 
BROUGHT OUT TO SAFETY, THERE 
WILL BE UTTER JUBILATION. 
WE DO HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. 
FOUR BOYS SO FAR, 13 IN ALL. 
THIS IS VERY MUCH THE FOCUS FOR 
THE COMING HOURS. 
>> I'M ASSUMING THIS WILL GO ON 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT? 
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY, WE 
JUST HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE 
FROM THE AUTHORITIES IN THIS 
PARTS OF NORTHERN THAILAND AND 
THEY GAVE AN UPDATE ON SOME OF 
THE IMMEDIATE DETAILS. 
WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
COLLEAGUES AT THE SCENE AND THE 
CAVE COMPLEX ABOUT ONE HOUR 
FROM CAR FROM HERE AND THEY 
HAVE SEEN THE VARIOUS AMBULANCES
DRIVE PAST TOWARDS THE MAIN 
ROAD. 
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN HELICOPTERS 
TAKEOFF SO WE DO EXPECT MORE 
BOYS TO BE BROUGHT HERE, 
CERTAINLY AS AND WHEN MORE BOYS 
ARE TAKEN OUT WE WILL HEAR 
MORE. 
REMEMBER, THIS WILL BE AN 
EXTREMELY LONG OPERATION. 
TO REACH THE BOYS THIS HAS 
TAKEN DIVERS 11 HOURS, SOME OF 
THEM HAVE 30 YEARS OF 
EXPERIENCE. 
THIS IS A HUGE JOURNEY. 
DURING THE WEEK WE WERE ABLE TO 
GO TO A CAVE ABOUT 10 
KILOMETERS AWAY FROM THE SPOT 
WHERE THE BOYS WERE TRAPPED AND 
THE RESCUE OPERATION WAS TAKING 
PLACE. 
WE GOT A GLIMPSE OF THAT PLACE 
AND IT WAS CLAUSTROPHOBIC AND 
IT WAS HOT AND MURKY. 
IF IT WAS FLOODED IN PARTS, 
THERE WOULD'VE BEEN ABSOLUTELY 
NO VISIBILITY WHATSOEVER. 
WE RECEIVED INFORMATION EARLIER 
FROM THE THAI NAVY TEAMS 
EXPLAINING THAT EACH BOY WOULD 
BE SHOREBIRD -- SHEPHERDED 
THROUGH BY TWO EXPERT DIVERS SO 
THEY WOULD REALLY FEEL THEIR 
PRESENCE AS THEY WERE MOVED 
THROUGH. 
THERE WAS A GUIDE ROPE SET UP 
AND RATHER THAN BEING ABLE TO 
LOOK WHERE YOU ARE GOING, 
PEOPLE CAN MOVE THROUGH BIT BY 
BIT. 
ALSO, OF COURSE, THE CORE DOORS 
ARE SO NARROW. THAT WAS PART OF 
THE PROBLEM. 
IT WAS NOT JUST GOING OUT AT 
ONE ANGLE. 
THEY WERE GOING UP, THEY WERE 
GOING DOWN, SOME OF THE BEST 
CAVE DIVERS IN THE WORLD SAID 
IT WAS A TOUGH CHALLENGE FOR 
THEM. 
REMEMBER, SOME OF THESE BOYS 
COULD NOT SWIM. 
YOU CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW THEY 
WERE FEELING ABOUT 10 AM THIS 
MORNING WHEN THE DECISION WAS 
MADE TO EMBARK ON THIS RESCUE 
ATTEMPT. 
THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 
SITUATION BUT WE DO BELIEVE 
LAST NIGHT THAT THEY THOUGHT, 
YES, THIS HAS TO HAPPEN. 
THE RAIN HAS STOPPED AND AFTER 
3-4 DAYS OF GLORIOUS SUNSHINE, 
IT HAS REALLY HELPED. 
THEY WERE PUMPING OUT SO MUCH 
WATER WHICH REALLY BROUGHT THE 
WATER LEVEL DOWN. 
THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD A GOLDEN 
OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR THIS. 
THEY HAVE GONE FOR IT AND WE 
ARE WAITING TO SEE THE OUTCOME. 
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR INSIGHT, 
PLEASE KEEP US POSTED. 
OUR CORRESPONDENT, DAN JOHNSON, 
IS IN THAILAND NEAR THE EXIT OF 
THE TUNNEL, NIGHT HAS FALLEN, 
WHAT IS THE LATEST? 
>> Reporter: IT IS JUST FALLING 
QUIET HERE, THERE HAS BEEN A 
LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES BUT IT LOOKS LIKE 
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE SITE FOR 
THE NIGHT. 
WE JUST GOT CONFIRMATION FROM 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE THAT IS 
GOING ON THAT FOUR OF THE BOYS 
HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM THE CAVE 
AND THAT THE OPERATION HAS 
CONCLUDED FOR THE NIGHT. 
THEY WILL LEAVE THE REST WHERE 
THEY ARE. 
WE UNDERSTAND THAT OTHERS HAVE 
NOT EVEN STARTED THE JOURNEY 
OUT. 
THEY WANTED TO TAKE A GROUP OF 
FOUR FIRST TO SEE IF THEY COULD 
SAFELY MAKE IT OUT AND IT LOOKS 
LIKE THEY HAVE ACHIEVED THAT. 
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE FEE AND 
GIVING EVERYONE A POSITIVE FEEL 
THAT THIS IS POSSIBLE AND 
EVERYONE CAN GET OUT SAFELY. 
THE ONE THING TO BEAR IN MIND 
IS THE TIREDNESS LEVELS OF THE 
INVESTIGATORS LEADING THIS 
OPERATION. 
THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD ALL 
DAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE ARE 
SOME OF THE DIVE TEAMS ACTUALLY 
LEAVING THE SITE NOT. THERE ARE 
18 SPECIALISTS DIVERS THAT HAVE 
BEEN GUIDING THE BOYS, AS YOU 
HAVE HEARD, IT TAKES MANY HOURS 
JUST TO GET ONE BOY TO THE EXIT 
OF THE CAVE. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE TAKING 
THE DECISION THAT THEY HAVE 
DONE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN FOR 
TODAY AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO 
REST SO THEY ARE NOT DOING THE 
JOB WHEN THEY ARE TOO TIRED, WE 
ARE TOLD THEY WILL COME BACK 
FRESH IN THE MORNING TO START 
AGAIN AROUND 8 AM. EVERYONE IS 
REALLY NOT POSITIVE THAT THEY 
HAVE PROVEN THIS RESCUE METHOD 
CAN WORK AND THEY CAN ACTUALLY 
TEACH THESE BOYS AND UP ABOUT 
SCUBA DIVING SO THAT THEY ARE 
COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONDITIONS 
AND WITH THE TASK THAT THEY 
HAVE TO COMPLETE AND THE TRACK 
THAT THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE 
THROUGH THE FLOODED UNDERWATER 
CAVERNS. 
THIS IS A TRICKY THING FOR ANY 
CAVE DIVER TO ACCOMPLISH, BUT 
IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FOUR OF 
THESE BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
MAKE IT SO FAR AND THE 
EXPECTATION IS THAT MORE WILL 
FOLLOW TOMORROW. 
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A HIVE OF 
ACTIVITY BEHIND YOU, CAN YOU 
GIVE US A TASTE OF WHAT IS 
GOING ON? 
>> Reporter: THIS VERY MUCH HAS 
THE FEEL OF THINGS WINDING 
DOWN, THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE 
FOR THE LAST 30 MINUTES 45 
MINUTES WITH A FLOOD OF WORKERS 
THAT HAVE LEFT THE SITE AFTER 
THE LAST AMBULANCE THAT WE SAW. 
IT WAS AROUND TWO HOURS AGO 
THAT WE SAW THE FIRST AMBULANCE 
DRIVE OUT JUST WHERE THAT CAR 
IS LEAVING NOW WITH LIGHTS 
FLASHING. 
IT HEADED OFF PRESUMABLY TO THE 
HOSPITAL THAT YOU HEARD NICK 
REPORTING FROM, THAT WAS 
FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER THREE 
AMBULANCES THAT LEFT WITH 
LIGHTS ON. 
WE HAVE SEEN AMBULANCES LEAVE 
WITHOUT THEIR LIGHTS FLASHING 
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE FOUR 
BOYS WERE TAKEN SEPARATELY IN 
THOSE AMBULANCES. 
OTHERS HAVE LEFT THE SITE AT 
THAT POSSIBLY IS JUST THE 
MOVING AWAY FOR THE NIGHT AND 
THEN EVERYONE WILL RETURN 
TOMORROW MORNING TO RESTART THE 
RESCUE EFFORT TO GET EVERYONE 
ELSE OUT. 
THEY SAID THAT TODAY WAS D-DAY, 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR IT. 
THEY WERE GOING TO TRY THEIR 
BEST TO PUT THIS RESCUE PLAN IN 
ACTION AND THEY HAVE PROVEN 
THIS CAN WORK FOR THE FOUR THAT 
GOT OUT. 
EVERYONE IS AWARE THERE ARE 
STILL RISKS AND LOTS OF WORK TO 
 
THE REMAINING BOYS AND THE 
COACH OUT OF THE CAVE.  
>> YOU SPEAK ABOUT EXHAUSTION 
LEVELS, HOW WILL THAT WORK 
TOMORROW, WILL THERE BE A 
TAGTEAM FORMAT? 
ANOTHER SET OF DIVERS GOING IN? 
>> Reporter: NO, WE BELIEVE IT 
IS THE SAME CORE TEAM. 
THE EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE 
REQUIRED TO MANAGE A RESCUE 
MISSION ACCESS ARE SO LIMITED. 
THERE ARE ONLY A FEW PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE DIVING SO 
DEEP AND SO FAR UNDERGROUND IN 
A CAVE THIS BIG. 
THEY HAVE COME FROM ALL AROUND 
THE WORLD, THERE ARE FIVE OR 
SIX NATIONALITIES INVOLVED. 
I THINK THAT THE PEOPLE WITH 
EXPERIENCE IN THESE CONDITIONS 
ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN 
CALLING THE SHOTS AND HAVE 
ASSESSED IF THE BOYS ARE READY 
TO MAKE THE JOURNEY AND THEY 
HAVE GUIDED THE MISSION FOR THE 
FIRST FOUR BOYS TAKING CARE OF 
THEM AND TAKING THEIR TIME. 
NO ONE WANTED TO RUSH THIS OR 
GET THINGS WRONG. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY WILL BE 
TAKING A WELL EARNED BREAK AND 
WILL COME BACK FRESH TOMORROW. 
THERE IS NO BIG SUPPORT TEAM, 
LOADS FROM THE THAI MILITARY 
AND NAVY BUT THEY WERE CANDID 
THAT THEY JUST DID NOT HAVE THE 
EXPERIENCE OF THESE CONDITIONS 
SO IT HAS WELCOMED THE 
EXPERIENCE BUT THEY NEED TO USE 
THIS WISELY. I THINK THE 
RATIONALE IS THERE IS NO POINT 
TIRING EVERYONE OUT OR WASTING 
THE EXPERIENCE AND ENERGY. 
LET EVERYONE TAKE THEIR TIME 
AND CARE AND COME BACK TOMORROW 
KNOWING THAT THIS RESCUE METHOD 
CAN SUCCEED AND HOPING THAT IT 
CAN HAPPEN FOR THE REST OF 
THOSE PEOPLE STUCK IN THE CAVE. 
CERTAINLY THEY NEED MORE TIME 
AND THERE ARE STILL RISKS. 
IT IS RAINING SLIGHTLY IN ONE 
RISK IS THAT IF THE RAIN GETS 
HEAVIER THE WATER LEVELS WILL 
INCREASE AGAIN. 
THE MANAGER SAID IF THAT 
HAPPENS THEY WILL SPEED THINGS 
UP AND MOVE QUICKLY TO GET 
PEOPLE OUT FOR THE MOMENT, IT 
DOES LOOK LIKE THEY ARE TAKING 
CARE OF PUTTING THE PLAN INTO 
OPERATION. 
>> WE KNOW FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN 
TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, HOW DID 
THEY DECIDE WHICH WAYS TO BRING 
OUT FIRST? 
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE HAD 
DOCTORS IN THE CAVE OVER THE 
WEEKEND ASSESSING THE CONDITION 
OF THE BOYS. 
THE CAVE DIVING EXPERTS HAVE 
BEEN ASSESSING THEIR STRENGTH, 
CONFIDENCE, ABILITY WITH SCUBA 
DIVING EQUIPMENT, AND THEY HAVE 
ALSO HAD MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS 
TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THIS 
TWO WEEK ORDEAL. 
TWO WEEKS ON THE GROUND WITHOUT 
PROPER FOOD. 
THERE WERE 9-10 DAYS BEFORE 
THEY WERE EVEN DISCOVERED AND 
THEY DID NOT EAT AT ALL. 
THEY HAVE DEFINITELY SUFFERED 
DUE TO THE ORDEAL AND OUR 
WEEKENDS. 
BUT THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF 
THE OPERATION BUT THAT THEY GOT 
TO A SUFFICIENT POINT TODAY 
WHERE THEY WERE READY TO AT 
LEAST START GETTING THEM OUT. 
WE UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE STARTED 
WITH THE WEAKEST, ACTUALLY. WE 
DO NOT KNOW IF THAT MEANS THE 
ONES WEAKEST IN TERMS OF 
STRENGTH OR WEAKEST WITH THE 
SCUBA DIVING TECHNIQUE, BUT 
THEY DID STARTED WITH THOSE 
WEAK BOYS THEY THOUGHT NEEDED 
TO COME OUT FIRST. 
THEY PUT A SMALL GROUP TOGETHER 
AND WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE A 
SMALL GROUP THAT CAME OUT. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY STARTED WITH 
FOUR AND THEY WERE TAKEN BY 
AMBULANCE, THERE IS ALSO THE 
OPTION OF HELICOPTERS THAT HAVE 
BEEN HERE ON STANDBY, WE HAVE 
NOT HEARD OR SEEN THE 
HELICOPTERS THIS CLOSE BECAUSE 
THEY DO HAVE TO STAY A CERTAIN 
DISTANCE AWAY TO FIND FLATLAND. 
I'M NOT SURE HOW THEY ALL GOT 
TO THE HOSPITAL BUT THEY DID GO 
THERE PRETTY QUICKLY TO GET 
TREATMENT. 
NO DOUBT, THIS WILL TAKE SOME 
RECOVERY FROM THE INITIAL SAW 
-- SHOCK AND THE IMPACT 
EMOTIONALLY AS WELL. 
EVERYONE HERE IS AWARE THAT IF 
THE REST ARE ABLE TO LEAVE 
SAFELY, IT IS NOT THE END. 
THERE WILL BE A LOT OF WORK TO 
DO AFTERWARDS FOR THESE BOYS TO 
ACTUALLY COME TO TERMS WITH 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND TO GET 
OVER IT AND DEAL WITH IT. 
AT THE MOMENT, THE HOPES ARE 
THAT THE REST OF THE GROUP WILL 
GET OUT SAFELY AND DOING THEM 
TOMORROW AND PERHAPS INTO THE 
DAY AFTER.  
>> DAN JOHNSON, OUR 
CORRESPONDENT ON THE GROUND, 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. 
>>> WE WILL NOW SPEAK TO THE 
DEPUTY BUREAU CHIEF OF REUTERS 
IN THAILAND, SHE JOINS ME NOW 
FROM BANGKOK, TELL ME WHAT THE 
LATEST IS THAT YOU ARE HEARING 
ON THE GROUND THERE IN BANGKOK? 
>> THE HEAD OF THE RESCUE 
MISSION HAS JUST FINISHED THAT 
PRESS CONFERENCE. 
>> Reporter: WE ARE HEARING 
THAT THE OPERATION IS OVER FOR 
ABOUT 10 HOURS, THEY NEED 10 
HOURS TO SET UP FOR THE NEXT 
OPERATION, IT LOOKS LIKE IT 
WILL BE JUST THOSE FOUR BOYS 
WHO WILL COME OUT OF THE CAVE 
TONIGHT. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO 
HOSPITALS. 
OUR REPORTER AT THE HOSPITAL 
SAYS THAT ALL FOUR BOYS HAVE 
LANDED IN CHANG RAI BY THE 
HOSPITAL AND ARE KEPT TO BE 
MONITORED THERE FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME.  
>> YOU ARE BASED IN THAILAND, I 
AM INTERESTED TO BETTER 
UNDERSTAND FROM YOU HOW THIS IS 
IMPACTING THE NATION AND HOW IT 
HAS BROUGHT THE COUNTRY 
TOGETHER? 
>> Reporter: THIS IS A 
POLITICALLY DIVIDED COUNTRY AND 
HAS BEEN FOR MORE THAN ONE 
DECADE, THEY ARE PRONE TO 
ANTIGOVERNMENT PROTESTS AND 
THIS HAS REALLY UNITED THE 
COUNTRY AND BROUGHT DIFFERENT 
CLINICAL GROUPS TOGETHER, WE 
HAVE SEEN AN OUTPOURING OF 
POSITIVE MESSAGES OF SUPPORT 
FOR THE BOYS ON THE THAI SOCIAL 
MEDIA. 
THIS EVENT HAS UNITED AN 
OTHERWISE DIVIDED COUNTRY. IT 
IS A GREAT PUBLIC RELATIONS 
EXERCISE FOR THE RULING 
MILITARY GOVERNMENT THAT HAS 
BEEN IN POWER FOR MORE THAN 
FOUR YEARS. 
IF THEY MANAGE TO GET THESE 
BOYS OUT SAFELY AND ALIVE, IT 
WILL BE A HUGE BONUS, A HUGE 
PLUS FOR THIS GOVERNMENT. 
>> I AM INTERESTED IN LEARNING 
MORE ABOUT THAT, WHAT HAS BEEN 
THE REACTION IN YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING TO HOW THE 
GOVERNMENT HAS REACTED TO THIS 
OPERATION SO FAR? 
HAVE THE RESCUE TEAM BEEN HAPPY 
WITH THE GOVERNMENTS EFFORTS? 
>> Reporter: WELL YES, IT SEEMS 
THAT THEY HAVE, THIS HAS BEEN 
PRIMARILY AN OPERATION, AT 
LEAST ON THE THAI SIDE, LED BY 
THE MILITARY, THE ARMY, THE 
THAI NAVY SEALS, AND IT HAS 
VERY MUCH UNITED ARMED FORCES 
THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS 
OPERATION. 
THE GOVERNMENT HAS PLAYED A BIG 
ROLE. 
SO FAR, POSITIVE FEEDBACK AND 
REACTION TO THIS ROLE SO FAR, 
AND ALSO THAT INTERNATIONAL 
EFFORTS AND HELP THAT ARE 
DEEPLY APPRECIATED BY THE 
THAILAND PEOPLE. 
>> WE SHOULD LEAVE YOU THERE 
AMY, THAT IS AMY FROM REUTERS 
IN THAILAND.  
>>> JUST TO REMIND YOU OF OUR 
BREAKING NEWS STORY, FOUR OF 
THE 12 BOYS TRAPPED IN THAILAND 
HAVE BEEN RESCUED, THE DIVERS 
ARE BREAKING FOR THE NIGHT 
BEFORE RESUMING OPERATIONS 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL LOOK BACK NOW WITH THIS 
REPORT FROM SIMON JONES. 
>> Reporter: WHEN THE AMBULANCE 
ARRIVED AT THE HOSPITAL THIS IS 
THE FIRST SIGN THAT THE FIRST 
BOYS HAVE BEEN RESCUED AFTER 
BEING TRAPPED FOR MORE THAN TWO 
WEEKS. 
TODAY WAS NAMED THANKSGIVING BY 
THE AUTHORITIES THAT DECLARED 
THE BOYS AND THEIR COACH WERE 
READY TO MOVE. 
WITH FEARS OF RISING WATERS, 
OFFICIALS DECIDED THEY COULD 
NOT WAIT ANY LONGER. 
>> THIS MORNING 13 PROFESSIONAL 
CAVE DIVERS ENTERED THE CAVE TO 
CARRY OUT THE EXTRACTION OF THE 
KIDS INCLUDING FIVE NAVY SEALS, 
THEY HAVE BEEN CLEARLY BRIEFED 
ON HOW THIS OPERATION WOULD BE 
CARRIED OUT. 
>> Reporter: THE BOYS WERE SAID 
TO BE DETERMINED, FOCUSED, 
PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY FIT. 
ASKS FOR -- EXPERT DIVERS HAVE 
BEEN GUIDING THEM OUT AND HAS 
INVOLVED A MIXTURE OF WALKING, 
WAITING, CLIMBING, AND DIVING. 
THEIR FAMILIES AGREED THAT THEY 
SHOULD BE MOVED AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE. 
SEVERAL HOURS INTO THE 
OPERATION, THE EMERGENCY 
VEHICLE SHOWED PROGRESS HAD 
BEEN MADE. 
THE FIRST GROUP OUT QUICKER THAN
EXPECTED. 
THE OPERATION CONTINUES AND THE 
RELIEF THAT THE FIRST BOYS HAVE 
BEEN RESCUED TEMPERED WITH THE 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHALLENGES 
AHEAD. 
SIMON JONES, BBC NEWS.  
>>> COORDINATING THE RESCUE 
MISSION ARE TWO BRITISH CAVE 
DIVING EXPERTS, MARTIN KNOWS 
THIS PAIR AND IS AN EXPERT 
HIMSELF, HE SAYS THE OPERATION 
SEEMS TO BE GOING WELL, HE 
SPOKE TO MY COLLEAGUE AND THIS 
IS WHAT HE SAID. 
>> Reporter: THIS IS FANTASTIC 
NEWS, THE BOYS ARE STARTING TO 
COME OUT OF THE CAVE AND THAT 
WILL BE A MASSIVE MORALE BOOST. 
IT OBVIOUSLY IS AN INDICATOR 
THAT THINGS ARE GOING VERY WELL 
AT THIS POINT IN TIME. 
CLEARLY, IT IS A BIG ASK FOR 
EVERYONE INVOLVED AND WE ALL 
UNDERSTAND HOW CRITICAL THIS 
WEATHER WINDOW IS AND HOW IT IS 
SHRINKING AS WE SPEAK. 
THE RIGHT PEOPLE ARE DOING THE 
RIGHT THINGS AND I AM 
OPTIMISTIC THAT THINGS WILL 
CARRY ON LIKE THIS.  
>> YOU MENTIONED THE WEATHER, 
CLEARLY YOU HAVE RESERVATIONS 
IN THE EXPERIENCE, WHAT ARE 
YOUR PRIMARY CONCERNS? 
>> LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, WATCHING 
THE PROGRAM, WE ALL KNOW THAT 
IF YOU HAVE A TORRENTIAL 
DWNPOUR, WE HAVE SEEN IMAGES 
OF THE CURRENT IN THE CAVE 
TODAY. 
THAT WOULD BE A MAJOR PROBLEM 
FOR EVERYONE IF THE RAINFALL 
INTENSIFIES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. 
>> FOR ALL OF US, IN FACT FOR 
THE WORLD, THIS HAS BEEN A 
CRASH COURSE IN CAVE DIVING. 
WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE QUITE 
TREACHEROUS CONDITIONS THAT THE 
BOYS ARE HAVING TO FACE, FOR A 
CHILD TO GO INTO THE CAVE, BUT 
FOR A CHILD TO CAVE DIVE, WHAT 
WOULD BE YOUR RESERVATIONS? 
>> Reporter: IT IS EXTREMELY 
CHALLENGING, THERE IS NO DOUBT 
ABOUT THAT AT ALL. 
THE IMAGES THAT WE ARE SEEING 
OF THE YOUNGSTERS, CLEARLY SHOW 
THEM IN GOOD MORALE, IN GREAT 
MORALE! 
AND YES, I'M QUITE SURE THAT 
THEY ARE TAKING TO THIS 
ACTIVITY REMARKABLY WELL 
JUDGING BY THE SPEED OF THE 
EVACUATION OF THE FIRST PEOPLE. 
>> JOHN AND RICHARD ARE OUT 
THERE ADDING THEIR EXPERTISE TO 
THE OPERATION, HAVE YOU HEARD 
ANY NEWS FROM THEM? 
>> Reporter NO, IT WOULD 
OBVIOUSLY BE GREAT TO SPEAK 
WITH THEM, BUT WE ALL 
APPRECIATE, EVERY FRIEND AND 
FAMILY MEMBER OF THE BRITISH 
DIVERS OUT THERE AND WE 
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE 
TOTALLY CONCENTRATING ON THE 
JOB THAT HAS TO BE DONE. 
THEY CANNOT AFFORD ANY 
DISTRACTION FROM GETTING THAT 
JOB DONE. 
THEY ARE THE BEST RESCUE TEAM 
THAT POSSIBLY COULD BE PULLED 
UP IN THIS INSTANT. 
I AM SURE THEY WILL CARRY ON 
DOING A FANTASTIC JOB. 
>> MARTIN, WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT 
THE TRAINING, THE PRACTICING, 
THE REHEARSALS THAT WOULD HAVE 
TAKEN PLACE. 
HOW IMPORTANT IS A DIVING PLAN 
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS? 
>> Reporter: I AM SURE THAT 
EVERYONE OUT THERE HAS BEEN 
FORMULATING THIS PLAN FOR MANY 
DAYS. 
CLEARLY, THE PLAN IS WORKING. 
>> HOW MANY PLANS WOULD THERE 
BE? 
>> Reporter: I'M SURE THERE 
HAVE BEEN QUITE A NUMBER OF 
PLANS AND THE WEATHER WINDOW, 
THIS NARROW TIME SLOT THAT WE 
HAVE CONFRONTING THE TEAM, THIS 
HAS SORT OF PRECIPITATED THE 
ACTION AS WE ALL KNOW. 
THIS EMERGENCY, THIS NARROW 
TIME SLOT WILL HAVE BEEN 
PLANNED FOR AND EVERYTHING IS 
GOING WELL. 
>> MARTIN, WHEN YOU ARE DOWN 
THERE, OBVIOUSLY COMMUNICATION 
TACTICS ARE IMPORTANT AMONGST 
ADULTS. 
WHAT SORT OF THINGS WOULD BE 
USED, AND WHAT WOULD BE USED TO 
COMMUNICATE WITH THE CHILDREN? 
>> Reporter: FORTUNATELY THERE 
HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF THAI NAVY 
SEALS GOING TO THE CHAMBER AND 
I AM QUITE SURE THAT ALL ALONG 
THE ROUTE THERE WILL BE THAI 
RESCUE PERSONNEL TO HELP WITH 
THE COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES 
SHOULD THERE BE TO -- 
COMMUNICATION DIFFICULTIES. 
>> WE HEARD ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SEDATING THE 
BOYS TO CALM THEM DOWN AND 
AVOID THE PANIC WHICH IS THE 
GREATEST DANGER IN A RESCUE 
SUCH AS THIS, IS SEDATION 
REALLY A POSSIBILITY? WHAT ARE 
THE RISKS INVOLVED IN SOMETHING 
LIKE THAT. 
>> Reporter: I AM NOT MEDICALLY 
QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THAT, BUT I 
DO KNOW CERTAINLY THAT SOME OF 
THE PERSONNEL ON SITE ARE 
DOCTORS, HIGHLY EXPERIENCED 
DOCTORS, HIGHLY EXPERIENCED 
CAVE DIVERS, IF THAT OPTION IS 
REQUIRED, I AM SURE THAT THE 
EQUIPMENT, THE KNOWLEDGE, THE 
EXPERTISE, IS THERE TO GET THE 
JOB DONE. 
>> MARTIN, IF YOU ARE CAVE 
DIVING WITH AN EXPERT COLLIE, 
FAIR ENOUGH, IF YOU ARE DIVING 
WITH SOMEONE THAT IS 
INEXPERIENCED, WHAT SORT OF 
ADVICE DO YOU GIVE TO THEM 
BEFORE ENTERING A SYSTEM LIKE 
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DIVE 
CONTINUES SAFELY? 
>> Reporter: ONCE THEY ARE 
UNDER THE WATER, THEY WILL 
EITHER BE, WELL, IT WILL BE 
DIFFICULT UNDER THE WATER 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN THE 
SITUATION YOURSELF. 
VISIBILITY WILL BE LOW. 
WE ALL HOPE THAT NO PANIC WILL 
ARISE. 
JUDGING BY WHAT WE SEE OF THESE 
YOUNGSTERS, I AM VERY OFF THE 
MYSTIC, THEY ARE BEING 
PARTICULARLY BRAVE. THEY ARE A 
CREDIT TO THAILAND. 
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY GREAT YOUNG 
PEOPLE. I AM CONFIDENT THAT 
THEY CAN HOLD THIS TOGETHER. 
>> SOME NEWS COMING IN FROM THE 
AFP NEWS AGENCY THAT THE 
OPERATION HAS PAUSED FOR THE 
NIGHT UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING. 
THEY SAY THEY NEED 10 HOURS TO 
PREPARE FOR THE NEXT MISSION. 
I SPOTTED THIS TWEET FROM 
JONATHAN HEARD OF THE BBC IN 
THAILAND. 
HE SAYS THAT FOUR BOYS ARE OUT, 
AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING. 
NINE, INCLUDING THE COACH 
REMAIN IN THE ORIGINAL LOCATION
ANDIT COULD TAKE ANOTHER DAY 
TO GET THEM OUT. 
THESE ARE PICTURES FROM THE 
HOSPITAL, WE DID HEAR FROM NICK 
BEEK AT THE HOSPITAL EARLIER. 
FROM THAT SAME PRESS CONFERENCE 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING 
REPORTS FROM, THE OPERATION 
CHIEF SAID ALL FOUR ARE IN 
PERFECT CONDITION. 
THIS HAS NOT BEEN VERIFIED BY 
MEDICAL OFFICIALS OR OUR 
CORRESPONDENT ON THE GROUND BUT 
THAT IS WHAT WE WERE TOLD AT 
THE PRESS CONFERENCE. 
KNIGHT HAS OF COURSE FALLEN IN 
THE STREETS ARE STILL BUSY. 
I AM SURE NO DOUBT INSIDE THE 
HOSPITAL WALLS, THINGS ARE 
HECTIC AS THEY ENSURE THAT 
THOSE CHILDREN ARE WELL AND FIT.
>>> CHRIS BOARDMAN FROM THE 
BRITISH CAVING ASSOCIATION SAID 
THE CHANGING WEATHER FORCED THE 
OPERATION TO GET UNDERWAY. 
FOR THE MOMENT, THE CONDITIONS 
HAVE BEEN IDEAL. 
>> THE TIMING IS EFFECTIVELY 
PERFECT, THEY HAVE BEEN 
DRAINING THE CAVE FOR AS LONG 
AS THEY HAVE KNOWN THE CHILDREN 
HAVE BEEN THERE. THEY ARE 
ACUTELY AWARE THAT THE MONSOON 
RAINS ARE LITERALL GOING TO 
START. 
THEY HAD TO MOVE RATHER 
DECISIVELY AND I HAVE SO MUCH 
RESPECT FOR THE RESCUE 
PERSONNEL AND DIVERS THAT HAVE 
COME FROM SO MANY NATION, FOR 
THE THAI NAVY SEALS, AND ALSO 
THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES TO 
REALLY HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE 
MARK HERE. 
WE KNOW THAT THE PERHAPS HAVE 
NOT DIVE THE WHOLE DISTANCE, 
BECAUSE OF THE DRAINAGE THAT 
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THEY WERE 
ABLE TO WALK SOME OF THE 
DISTANCE AND THAT WOULD MAKE 
THIS EASIER. 
>> HOW SAFE IS CAVE DIVING FOR 
CHILDREN? 
>> IT IS SIMPLY NOT ALLOWED IN 
THE UK FOR CHILDREN AT ALL. 
IF YOU ARE ASKED TO GO UNDER 
THE AGE OF 16 IN A CAVE WITH 
ANYONE FROM A GROUP, THEY WOULD 
DEFINITELY SAY, NO, WAIT UNTIL 
YOU ARE OLDER. 
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN LEARN TO DIVE 
IN WARM WATER WHERE IT IS 
ORDINARY DIVING, NOT IN THE 
CAVES, THEN YOU CAN TAKE THOSE 
SKILLS UNDERGROUND WHEN YOU ARE 
OLDER. 
>> YOU OBVIOUSLY WORK WITHIN 
CAVE DIVING, OR THE BRITISH 
CAVING ASSOCIATION RATHER, HOW 
DO YOU MAKE CAVING SAFE FOR 
CHILDREN? ARE YOU HEARING 
MURMURING FROM PARENTS WHO 
PLANNED TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN 
OFF ON A SUMMER HOLIDAY AND NOW 
THEY ARE SAYING, ACTUALLY, CAN 
WE HOLD BACK? 
>> Reporter: NOT A WORD, I KNOW 
THAT SOME HAVE BEEN GOING 
CAVING IN FRANCE, NO ONE HAS 
ASKED ME ABOUT IT, I'M SURE WE 
WILL TALK ABOUT IN THE COMING 
WEEKS. 
THIS HAS TO DO WITH PICKING A 
VENUE THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR 
THE AGE AND EXPERIENCE OF THE 
CHILDREN AND THAT IS NO 
CRITICISM AT ALL OF THE 
FOOTBALL COACH. 
HE DID NOT THINK HE WAS GOING 
CAVING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING 
TO A TOURIST DESTINATION, THE 
SHOW CAVE, SOMETHING THAT MANY 
HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS WOULD DO 
WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS ON A 
FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS. 
IT JUST TURNS OUT THAT THIS 
CAVE HAD A BIT OF A BITE, I'M 
QUITE CERTAIN THAT IN THE 
FUTURE THERE WILL BE THOUGHT 
GIVEN TO SOME REGULATION AND 
PLANNING.  
>> LET'S REMIND YOU OF WHERE WE 
ARE WITH THE BREAKING NEWS, THE 
MISSION TO RESCUE THESE BOYS 
STARTED EARLIER THIS MORNING 
AROUND 3 AM UK TIME, 10 AM 
LOCAL TIME THERE ON A SUNDAY. 
AT LEAST FOUR BOYS WE KNOW ARE 
TOLD TO BE IN GOOD HEALTH 
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST PRESS 
CONFERENCE THAT WE HEARD FROM 
EARLIER. 
THE REST REMAIN TRAPPED IN THE 
ORIGINAL LOCATION WHERE THEY 
WERE FOUND EARLIER THIS WEEK. 
THEY WERE TRAPPED BY MONSOON 
FLOODS FOR OVER TWO WEEKS AND 
THE OPERATION IS SAID TO BE A 
RACE AGAINST TIME. 
THERE IS A HOSPITAL PICTURE 
WHERE THE BOYS HAVE BEEN TAKEN 
AND ARE TREATED BY LOCAL 
DOCTORS. 
>> EARLIER MY COLLEAGUE SPOKE 
WITH A LIEUTENANT COLONEL WHO 
WAS PART OF A 2004 RESCUE 
MISSION IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S 
BIGGEST CAVE SYSTEMS IN MEXICO 
CITY.  
>> IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT WE ARE 
SEEING PEOPLE COME OUT OF THE 
CAVE, BUT IT IS NOT OVER UNTIL 
IT IS OVER. 
YOU GO THROUGH A PERIOD OF 
SEEING SUCCESS, THE RESCUE IS 
NOT OVER UNTIL EVERYONE IS OUT, 
INCLUDING THE RESCUERS. 
THERE IS A WAY -- A WAYS TO GO 
BUT IT IS GOOD NEWS THAT WE ARE 
SEEING PEOPLE GO THROUGH THESE 
DIFFICULT PASSAGES AND GET OUT. 
I WOULD CAUTION PEOPLE TO BE 
CAREFUL, THERE IS STILL AN 
AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED 
TO COME OUT OF THE CAVE AND WE 
STILL HAVE YET TO SEE THE 
REMAINING MEMBERS OF THE TEAM 
COME THROUGH.  
>> YOU HAVE BEEN PART OF THE 
RESCUE TEAM AS I SAID EARLIER 
THAT TOOK PLACE IN MEXICO CITY. 
HOW CLOSELY DOES THAT EVENT 
RESEMBLE WHAT WE ARE SEEING IN 
THAILAND? 
>> IN SOME WAYS IT IS VERY 
SIMILAR, WE RESCUED A GROUP OF 
SIX CAVERS FROM A SIMILAR 
SITUATION. THE BIG DIFFERENCE 
WAS THAT IT WAS PART OF A 
CONTINGENCY PLAN. 
ALTHOUGH IT WAS A RESCUE, WE 
WERE AWARE THAT THE CAVE 
FLOODED, WE HAD A DAY TO BE IN 
THAT CAVE BEFORE WE WENT IN 
THERE. 
WE KNEW THAT IT HAD FLOODED TO 
A ROOF SO WE HAD A CAMP SET UP 
IN CASE OF EMERGENCY. 
WE HAD LINES LAID TO ALLOW 
THOSE PEOPLE TO COME OUT 
THROUGH THAT CAVE. 
WE ALSO HAD RICK AND ANOTHER 
DIVER ON STANDBY IN THE UK 
SHOULD THAT HAPPEN. 
THE DIFFERENCE WAS, WE WERE 
MORE PREPARED BECAUSE WE KNEW 
THAT PARTICULAR CAVE FLOODED.  
>> THERE ARE SO MANY TEAMS FROM 
AROUND THE WORLD INVOLVED IN 
THIS, IN TERMS OF CAVE DIVING, 
WHERE DO YOU GO FIRST FOR 
EXPERTISE? 
>> THE OBVIOUS ANSWER FOR ME 
WAS RICK STANTON. 
WE KNEW THAT NEARLY 14 YEARS AGO
. THE SITUATION HAS NOT REALLY 
CHANGED. 
THERE ARE SOME REALLY GOOD CAVE 
DRIVERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, 
BUT IT IS A CLOSE KNIT 
COMMUNITY. 
AND IS THERE A NUMBER TO DIAL 
FOR A CAVE DIVE RESCUE? 
PROBABLY NOT, IT IS AN 
INTERESTING THOUGHT. 
IF YOU ARE CAVING AT THE LEVEL 
THAT WE CERTAINLY WERE IN 
MEXICO, THERE WERE ENOUGH 
MEMBERS OF MY TEAM THAT 
UNDERSTOOD HUTU RING AND WE HAD 
ARRANGED THAT BEFOREHAND.  
>> WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT A 
DIVING PLAN, WHAT IS INVOLVED 
IN ONE OF THOSE, CAN YOU TAKE 
US THROUGH? 
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TO KNOW 
THE CAVE IN DETAIL AND RICK 
WOULD'VE DONE THAT WHEN HE 
MOVED IN TO FIND THE MEMBERS OF 
THE TEAM, YOU WOULD NEED TO 
FIND OUT HOW LONG YOU WERE 
SUBMERGED, HOW COMPLEX THE 
SYSTEM IS, AND WE HAVE SEEN A 
LOT OF INFORMATION ON HOW TIGHT 
AND DIFFICULT IT WAS. 
THAT WOULD BE A BIG PART OF THE 
PLAN, CAN YOU MOVE PEOPLE IN? 
THE OTHER THING TO CONSIDER IS 
THE SAFETY OF THE RESCUER. 
IF YOU ARE MOVING SOMEONE 
THROUGH AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT
AND THEY ARE NOT USED TO IT, IT 
IS AS DANGEROUS FOR THE RESCUER 
AS IT IS FOR THE PERSON BEING 
RESCUED, PARTICULARLY IF THAT 
PERSON STARTS TO PANIC AND 
LOSES THE LINE, OR EVEN WORSE, 
GETS EVERYONE DISORIENTED. ALL 
OF THAT HAS TO BE CONSIDERED. 
YOU NEED TO TRAIN FOR. 
WE TRAINED ON THE FAR SIDE. I 
HAD NOT TRAINED MEMBERS OF THE 
TEAM BEFORE WE WENT TO MEXICO. 
BUT BEFORE WE DIVE THEM 
THROUGH, WE TRAINED THEM IN THE 
CAVE, IN WATER, TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE UNDERSTOOD HOW THEY 
WOULD REACT BEFORE WE EVEN 
CONSIDERED BRINGING THEM OUT 
USING DIVING. 
>> STEVE, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 
QUICKLY, AND OUR VIEWERS, WE 
ARE LOOKING AT THE SCENE NOW OF 
RESCUERS WITH LIT HELMETS 
WALKING AWAY AND AROUND THE SITE
ITSELF. A FEW MINUTES AGO WE 
SAW A NUMBER OF AMBULANCES 
MOVING. 
AS FAR AS THE RESCUERS, WHAT 
ARE THEY CARRYING? 
THEY HAVE BAGS, RED SWEATSHIRTS 
ON AS WELL. 
SOME OF THEM HAVE TORCHES ON. 
JUST GOING BACK AGAIN TO WHAT 
YOU HAVE SAID ABOUT TRAINING 
CHILDREN WERE PEOPLE BEFORE 
BRINGING THEM THROUGH AND 
COMPLETING THAT RESCUE, WHAT 
EXACTLY DO YOU LOOK FOR? HOW ON 
EARTH DO YOU BEGIN A CRASS -- 
CRASH COURSE IN CAVE DIVING IN 
AN EMERGENCY SITUATION? 
>> YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM IN THE 
GEAR THEY WILL BE MOVING 
THROUGH THE CAVE THROUGH, YOU 
FIND A SAFE PIECE OF WATER THAT 
IS NOT SUBMERGED, OR NOT 
COVERED BY A CAVE PASSAGE 
ABOVE, AND THEN YOU PUT THEM 
UNDERWATER AND SEE HOW THEY 
REACT. 
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE HAD 
PLANNED IN MEXICO, WE HAD A 
DIVE LINE LAID ACROSS THE BASE 
OF THE CAVE. 
EFFECTIVELY WHAT WE DID IS PUT 
A LOT OF WAVE -- WAIT ON THEM, 
THEY DID NOT SWIM, THEY CRAWLED 
AND FOLLOWED THE ROPE OUT. 
THEY MAY WELL HAVE USED THE 
SAME METHOD. THE MOMENT THAT 
YOU MAKE THEM NEUTRALLY 
BUOYANT, MEANING THEY CAN 
FLOAT, THEY ARE MORE DIFFICULT 
TO MANAGE. 
YOU MAKE THAT ASSESSMENT ON THE 
FAR SIDE WHEN YOU PUT THEM IN 
THE EQUIPMENT AND SEE HOW THEY 
PERFORM IN THAT WATER. 
THEN THEY ARE NOT DIVING 
STRAIGHT INTO THE UNKNOWN, THEY 
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON AND 
THEY SEE THAT THEY CAN BE 
LOOKED AFTER AND THEN YOU 
REASSURE THEM WITH YOUR 
PRESENCE BECAUSE YOU CANNOT 
SPEAK TO PEOPLE. 
THEY GET TO KNOW THAT IT IS 
ACTUALLY OKAY. 
ONCE YOU HAVE THEIR TRUST YOU 
CAN BRING THEM OUT. 
IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT.  
>> YES, SPEAKING ABOUT TRUST, 
HOW DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH 
SOMEONE WHO IS INEXPERIENCED 
ONCE THE DIVE IS UNDERWAY? 
>> YOU CAN'T, YOU JUST HAVE TO 
BE PRESENT. YOU HAVE TO KEEP 
YOUR HAND ON THEIR ARM OR HAND, 
THEY HAVE TO FEEL YOU BECAUSE 
THEY CANNOT FEEL YOU IN THAT -- 
SEE YOU IN THAT MUDDY WATER. 
THEY MUST KNOW THAT YOU ARE 
THERE AND THEY MUST TRUST YOU. 
TO DEVELOP THAT TRUST IS 
DIFFICULT IN THAT SHORT PERIOD 
OF TIME. BUT A SHORT DIVE IN 
PREPARATION BEFORE THEY ARE PUT 
INTO HARMS WAY MADE A BIG 
DIFFERENCE FOR US. 
I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THEY 
HAVE FOLLOWED A SIMILAR SORT OF 
PASS. 
>> ONCE YOU HAVE THE PERSON OUT 
OF THE CAVE, OBVIOUSLY THESE 
BOYS HAVE BEEN IN THERE FOR 
NEARLY A FORTNIGHT, THERE WILL 
BE SOME LIGHT SENSITIVITY, FOR 
EXAMPLE, IN THEIR EYES. 
WHAT SORT OF MEDICAL PLANS ARE 
PUT IN PLACE? 
WHAT DID YOU DO IN MEXICO? 
>> WELL, THE HUMAN BODY ADAPTS 
QUICKLY. 
ACTUALLY, THE BIGGEST SHOCK THAT
THE PEOPLE IN OUR PARTY HAD 
WHEN THEY CAME OUT WAS THE 
LEVEL OF INTEREST. 
THE WORLD'S LEVEL OF INTEREST 
IN WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. 
IT WAS NOT MEDICAL, IT WAS 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TO KNOW THAT IN 
OUR CASE THEY WERE ON THE NEWS 
EVERY DAY FOR 10 DAYS IN THE 
WESTERN WORLD. 
THAT WAS A BIG THING, THEY WERE 
SAYING, WHAT IS THE FUSS ABOUT? 
THIS IS A PLAN WE HAD ALREADY 
ENACTED. 
I SUSPECT THAT THE MEMBERS OF 
THE FOOTBALL TEAM WILL FEEL THE 
SAME, IT IS LIKE, WOW!, THEY 
WILL BE AMAZED THAT THERE WERE 
SO MANY PEOPLE INVOLVED AND 
THEY WILL BE AMAZED AT THE 
MILITARY AND THAT ALL OF THOSE 
PEOPLE ARE AROUND THE CAVE OR 
IN THE VICINITY. 
REGARDING THE MEDICAL, IT IS 
JUST A CHAPTER -- CHECKUP, YOU 
NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE FIT 
AND HEALTHY AND THEY ARE YOUNG 
BOYS, FOOTBALLERS, REASONABLY 
FIT, THEY PROBABLY NEED A GOOD 
MEAL AND SOME GOOD WATER AND 
REHYDRATION. THEN THEY WILL BE 
RIGHT AS RAIN. 
PSYCHOLOGICALLY, IT WILL BE 
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THEY COPE
WHEN THEY REALIZE HOW MUCH 
INTEREST THE WORLD HAS HAD IN 
THEIR SITUATION.  
>> WOULD SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN 
RESCUED UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS 
NORMALLY HAVE PSYCHOLOGICAL 
HEALTH IN PLACE, IS THAT 
ADVISABLE? 
>> I DON'T KNOW, PARTICULARLY 
WITH THE AGE OF THE YOUNGSTERS 
INVOLVED. 
IT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WILL 
HAVE TO LOOK AT. 
OBVIOUSLY, THEY MIGHT HAVE 
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH 
CONFINED SPACES OR WATER. 
IF THIS IS DONE WITH A POSITIVE 
WAY, IF THEY GOT OUT AND IT HAS 
NOT LED TO ANY TRAUMA, THEN 
THEY PROBABLY WILL GET OVER 
THIS QUITE QUICKLY, MOST YOUNG 
PEOPLE ARE PRETTY RESILIENT. 
I SHOULD NOT THINK THERE WOULD 
BE ANY LONG-TERM EFFECTS.  
>> JUST TO GO BACK AGAIN 
QUICKLY, YOU MENTIONED SOME OF 
THE TRAINING THAT TOOK PLACE 
AND THE EQUIPMENT. 
HOW HEAVY IS THAT EQUIPMENT? 
WOULD THE BOYS HAVE BEEN DRESSED
IN PROPER WETSUITS? 
WOULD THEY NEED THAT DUE TO THE 
WATER, OR IS THE WATER WARM IN 
THE CAVES? 
>> I DO NOT KNOW THE ACTUAL 
TEMPERATURE, BUT YOU WILL FIND 
THAT THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF 
THE CAVE AND PROBABLY THE WATER 
ASSOCIATED IS THE AVERAGE 
TEMPERATURE OF THE COUNTRY THAT 
YOU ARE IN. 
BEING IN THAILAND, I WOULD 
IMAGINE THE WATER WOULD 
PROBABLY BE IN THE EARLY 20s, 
21 OR 22 DEGREES CELSIUS. 
YOU CAN DO PRETTY WELL WITHOUT 
A WETSUIT IN THAT TEMPERATURE. 
THE EQUIPMENT IS FAIRLY HEAVY, 
BUT I AM SURE THAT THEY MANAGED 
THAT IN A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THOSE YOUNGSTERS MAY NOT HAVE 
CARRIED THAT EQUIPMENT 
THEMSELVES, OR IF THEY DID, IT 
WOULD BE SOMETHING THEY COULD 
MANAGE. 
AS I SAY, IT IS ADVANTAGEOUS IN 
THAT SITUATION THAT PEOPLE DO 
NOT ACTUALLY SWIM. 
IF THEY DO SWIM, THEY GET LOST, 
IF THEY ARE HEAVY, YOU CAN 
PLACE THEM ON THE FLOOR AND THE 
DIVER KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE AND 
THE RESCUE DIVER CAN MOVE 
AROUND THEM AND THEY CANNOT 
EASILY MOVE AWAY. 
THAT IS A REAL ADVANTAGE, THEN 
YOU KNOW WHERE THE DIVERS ARE 
AND WHAT THEY ARE UP TO. 
>> WE WILL BRING SOME MORE 
LINES FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE 
THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER, THAT 
WAS FROM THE THAI HEAD OF THE 
RESCUE OPERATION. 
HE SAID THAT THE RESCUE WORKERS 
NEED ABOUT 10 HOURS TO PREPARE 
FOR THE OPERATION. 
THEY WERE RESCUED FROM THE CAVE 
AND TRANSFERRED BY HELICOPTER 
TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL, THAT 
IS WHERE WE HEARD FROM NICK 
BEEK. 
DAN JOHNSON IS AT THE MOUTH OF 
THE CAVE AND GAVE US THIS UPDATE
.  
>> THIS IS FALLING QUIET IN THE 
AREA AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 
OF ACTIVITY IN THE LAST FEW 
MINUTES. 
IT LOOKS LIKE PEOPLE ARE 
LEAVING THE SITE AND WE JUST 
RECEIVED CONFIRMATION FROM THE 
PRESS CONFERENCE THAT FOUR OF 
THE BOYS HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM 
THE CAVE AND THAT THE OPERATION 
HAS CONCLUDED FOR THE NIGHT. 
THEY WILL LEAVE THE REST WHERE 
THEY ARE, WE UNDERSTAND THAT 
OTHERS HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED 
THE JOURNEY OUT. 
THEY WANTED TO TAKE A GROUP OF 
FOUR FIRST TO SEE IF THEY COULD 
SAFELY MAKE IT OUT. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE 
ACHIEVED THAT. 
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE FEAT GIVING 
EVERYONE A POSITIVE FEEL THAT 
THEY CAN GIVE AND GET EVERYONE 
OUT SAFELY. 
ONE THING TO BEAR IN MIND IS 
THE TIREDNESS LEVELS OF THOSE 
LEADING THE INVESTIGATION. THEY 
HAVE BEEN WORKING BUSILY ALL 
DAY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THOSE ARE 
THE DIVE TEAMS LEAVING THE SITE 
RIGHT NOW. 
THERE WERE 18 SPECIALIST DIVERS 
THAT HAVE BEEN GUIDING THESE 
BOYS OUT. 
AS YOU HEARD, IT TAKES MANY 
HOURS TO GET ONE BOY TO THE 
EXIT OF THE CAVE. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE TAKEN 
THE DECISION THAT THEY HAVE 
DONE AS MUCH AS THEY CAN FOR 
TODAY AND EVERYONE NEEDS TO 
REST SO THEY ARE NOT DOING THE 
JOB WHEN THEY ARE TOO TIRED. 
THEY WILL COME BACK FRESH IN 
THE MORNING TO START AROUND 8 AM
. BUT EVERYONE IS POSITIVE THAT 
THEY HAVE PROVEN THIS RESCUE 
METHOD CAN WORK AND THEY CAN 
TEACH THESE BOYS ENOUGH ABOUT 
SCUBA DIVING SO THEY ARE 
COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONDITIONS 
AND THE TASK THAT THEY HAVE TO 
COMPLETE AND THE TRACKS THAT 
THEY HAVE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH 
THE FLOODED UNDERWATER CAVERNS. 
A TRICKY THING FOR ANY CAVE 
DIVER TO ACCOMPLISH. 
IT DOES LOOK LIKE AT LEAST FOUR 
OF THE BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
MAKE IT SO FAR AND THE 
EXPECTATION IS THAT MORE WILL 
FOLLOW TOMORROW.  
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A HIVE OF 
ACTIVITY BEHIND YOU, CAN YOU 
GIVE US A TASTE OF WHAT IS 
GOING ON? 
>> Reporter: THIS VERY MUCH AS 
THE FEEL OF THINGS WINDING 
DOWN, THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE 
FOR THE LAST 45 MINUTES WITH A 
FLOOD OF WORKERS THAT HAVE LEFT 
THE SITE AFTER THE LAST 
AMBULANCE THAT WE SAW. 
IT WAS AROUND TWO HOURS AGO 
THAT WE SAW THE FIRST AMBULANCE 
DRIED OUT, JUST WHERE THAT CAR 
IS LEAVING RIGHT NOW, WITH 
LIGHTS FLASHING, IT HAD 
PRESUMABLY TO THE HOSPITAL THAT 
YOU HEARD NICK REPORTING FROM. 
THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER 
THREE NUMB -- THREE AMBULANCES, 
WE HAVE SEEN THEM LEAVE WITHOUT 
LIGHTS FLASHING SO IT DOES LOOK 
LIKE THE FOUR BOYS WERE TAKEN 
SEPARATELY WITH THE LIGHTS 
FLASHING. 
OTHER AMBULANCES HAVE LEFT BUT 
THAT COULD BE THEM JUST MOVING 
AWAY FOR THE NIGHT AND THEN 
EVERYONE WILL RETURN TOMORROW 
MORNING TO RESTART THE RESCUE 
EFFORT. 
TODAY WAS THE DAY, THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO GO FOR IT AND 
THEY WERE GOING TO TRY THEIR 
BEST TO PUT THE PLAN INTO 
ACTION. 
THEY HAVE PROVEN THAT IT CAN 
WORK FOR THE FOUR THAT HAVE 
GOTTEN OUT SO FAR. 
EVERYONE IS AWARE THERE ARE 
STILL RISKS AND IT WILL BE 
TRICKY GETTING THE REMAINING 
BOYS AND THEIR COACH OUT OF THE 
CAVE TOMORROW, POSSIBLY INTO 
THE DAY AFTER.  
>> YOU SPEAK ABOUT EXHAUSTION 
LEVELS, HOW WILL THAT WORK, 
WILL THERE BE ANOTHER SET OF 
DIVERS GOING INTO THE CAVES? 
>> Reporter: WE BELIEVE IT WILL 
BE THE SAME CORE TEAM, THE 
EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE 
REQUIRED TO MANAGE THIS IS SO 
LIMITED. 
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE HAVE 
EXPERIENCED DIVING SO DEEP 
UNDERGROUND IN A CAVE SO BIG. 
THERE ARE FIVE OR SIX 
NATIONALITIES INVOLVED. THESE 
GUYS HAVE BEEN CALLING THE 
SHOTS AND ASSESSED WHETHER THE 
BOYS HAVE STARTED MAKING THE 
JOURNEY AND THEY HAVE GUIDED 
THE MISSION TODAY FOR THE FIRST 
FOUR BOYS TAKING CARE OF THEM 
THROUGHOUT THE WAY. 
THEY ARE TAKING THEIR TIME AS 
WELL. 
NO ONE WANTED TO RUSH THIS AND 
GET THINGS WRONG, IT LOOKS LIKE 
THEY ARE TAKING A WELL EARNED 
BREAK AND WILL COME BACK FRESH 
TOMORROW. 
THERE IS A BIG SUPPORT TEAM, 
LOADS OF SOLDIERS, DIVERS FROM 
THE THAI NAVY, BUT THE NAVY WAS 
CANDID THAT THEY JUST DID NOT 
HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING 
IN THESE CONDITIONS SO THEY 
HAVE WELCOMED THE INTERNATIONAL 
SUPPORT. 
THEY HAVE TO USE THAT 
EXPERIENCE WIFELY. 
I THINK THE RATIONALE IS THERE 
IS NO POINT IN TIRING EVERYONE 
OUT AND NO POINT WASTING THE 
EXPERIENCE AND ENERGY. 
LET EVERYONE TAKE THEIR TIME, 
TAKE THEIRCARE, AND COME BACK 
TOMORRO KNOWING THAT THE 
RESCUE METHOD CAN SUCCEED IN 
KNOWING THAT THEY CAN MAKE THAT 
HAPPEN FOR THE REST OF THE 
PEOPLE STUCK IN THE CAVE THEY 
WILL NEED MORE TIME AND RISKS 
ARE INVOLVED, IT IS RAINING SO 
THERE IS A RISK THAT THEY WOULD 
SPEED THINGS UP AND MOVE 
QUICKLY TO GET PEOPLE OUT AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE, FOR THE 
MOMENT, IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE 
TAKING CARE AND PUTTING THIS 
PLAN INTO OPERATION AND IT IS 
SUCCEEDING.  
>> WE KNOW THAT FOUR OF THE 
BOYS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE 
HOSPITAL, HOW DID THEY DECIDE 
WHOM TO BRING OUT FIRST? 
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE HAD 
DOCTORS IN THE CAVE THROUGHOUT 
THE WEEKEND ASSESSING THE 
CONDITIONS OF THE BOYS. 
THE CAVE DIVING EXPERTS HAVE 
BEEN ASSESSING THEIR STRENGTH, 
CONFIDENCE, ABILITY WITH THE 
SCUBA DIVING EQUIPMENT, AND 
THEY'VE ALSO HAD MEDICAL 
EXAMINATIONS TO ASSESS THE 
IMPACT OF THIS TWO WEEK ORDEAL, 
TWO WEEKS UNDERGROUND WITHOUT 
PROPER FOOD. 
THERE WERE NINE OR 10 DAYS 
BEFORE THEY WERE DISCOVERED 
WHERE THEY DIDN'T EAT ANYTHING. 
THEY HAVE SUFFERED IN OUR 
WEEKEND, THE OFFICIALS IN 
CHARGE OF THE OPERATION THOUGHT 
THAT THEY HAD GOTTEN TO A 
SUFFICIENT POINT TODAY WHERE 
THEY WERE READY TO BE STARTING 
TO MOVE THEM. 
THEY DID START WITH THE WEEK 
IS, WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT MEANS 
IN TERMS OF STRENGTH, OR IN 
TERMS OF GETTING TO GRIPS WITH 
THE SCUBA DIVING TEAM, BUT THEY 
DID START WITH THE WEAKEST BOYS 
WHO THEY THOUGHT NEEDED TO COME 
OUT AND THEY PUT A SMALL GROUP 
TOGETHER. 
WE WERE TOLD THAT IT WAS A 
SMALL GROUP THAT CAME OUT EACH 
TIME AND THEY DID START WITH 
FOUR AND THEY WERE TAKEN BY 
AMBULANCE AND THERE IS THE 
OPTION OF HELICOPTERS ON 
STANDBY AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN OR 
HEARD THEM THIS CLOSE BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE TO BE A CERTAIN 
DISTANCE AWAY TO FIND THE 
FLATLAND. 
THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY QUICKLY 
TO GET THE TREATMENT AND NO 
DOUBT, THIS WILL TAKE 
RECOVERING FROM THE INITIAL 
SHOCK AND THE IMPACT AND 
EMOTIONAL EFFECT. 
EVERYONE IS AWARE THAT IF THEY 
ARE ABLE TO LEAVE, THIS IS NOT 
THE END, THERE WILL BE LOTS OF 
WORK TO DO AFTERWARDS FOR THESE 
BOYS TO COME TO TERM WITH 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED AND
AT THE MOMENT, THE HOPES IS 
THAT THE REST OF THE GROUP WILL 
GET OUT SAFELY AND JOIN THEM 
TOMORROW OR THE DAY AFTER.  
>> OUR CORRESPONDENT HAS BEEN 
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL WHERE THE 
BOYS ARE BEING TREATED, HE GAVE 
ME THIS UPDATE. 
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE MAIN 
HOSPITAL IN THE SHANG RAI 
REGION ABOUT ONE HOUR BY CAR 
FROM THE CAVE COMPLEX WHERE THE 
BOYS HAVE BEEN RESCUED FROM 
TODAY -- CHANG RAI REGION ABOUT 
ONE HOUR BY CAR FROM THE CAVE 
COMPLEX WHERE THE BOYS HAVE 
BEEN RESCUED FROM TODAY. 
IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO, TWO 
AMBULANCES HAVE ARRIVED, THE 
RAILINGS WERE MOVED AND 
AMBULANCES RACED THROUGH TO THE 
MAIN ENTRANCE, WE HAVE ALSO 
SEEN POLICE HELICOPTERS INVOLVED
THAT HAVE BEEN'S -- HAVE BEEN 
SEEN FLYING OVERHEAD, THE 
CRUCIAL INFORMATION THAT COMES 
FROM THE PRESS CONFERENCE AND 
THE THAI NAVY SEALS THAT HAVE 
BEEN INVOLVED, THEY SAY THAT 
FOUR OF THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT OUT NOW. AS FOR THEIR 
CONDITION, YOU ASKED ME THAT, 
WE DO NOT KNOW AT THIS POINT, 
CLEARLY THE TEAMS HERE HAVE 
BEEN WAITING FOR THEIR ARRIVAL. 
IN TERMS OF HOW THE INDIVIDUAL 
BOYS ARE FARING, WE DO NOT KNOW 
AT THE MOMENT.  
>> IS THERE ANY IDEA WHAT KIND 
OF IMMEDIATE TREATMENT THEY 
COULD BE RECEIVING, FOR 
EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE NOT SEEN 
MIKE FOR A NUMBER OF DAYS? 
>> Reporter: THE THING TO 
REMEMBER IS THEY HAVE HAD A 
DOCTOR WITH THEM FOR NEARLY ONE 
WEEK. 
THE DOCTOR WAS ABLE TO GET 
THERE AND ASSESSED THEM ON A 
DAILY BASIS. 
REMEMBER, LAST NIGHT, THE 
FORMER GOVERNOR HERE IN CHARGE 
OF THE RESCUE OPERATION SAID 
THAT THE BOYS WERE STRONG 
ENOUGH TO EMBARK ON THE RESCUE 
ATTEMPT. 
CLEARLY A RESCUE ATTEMPT WAS 
MADE THERE. 
WE HAVE HAD DETAILS FROM THE 
DOCTORS AND NERVOUS -- NURSES 
AND THEY SAY A SPECIAL UNIT IN 
THE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN SET ASIDE 
FOR THE BOYS, WE DON'T OF IT IS 
INDIVIDUAL CUBICLES, BUT 
CERTAINLY SPECIAL TEAMS ON HAND 
WILL BE CARRYING OUT THE BASIC 
OBSERVATIONS, BLOOD TESTS, 
URINE TEST, NORMAL THINGS LIKE 
THAT. 
OF COURSE, THAT IS IF IT IS THE 
BEST OUTCOME, IF THE BOYS ARE 
ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE CAVES, 
WALK PART OF THE WAY, AND THEN 
ESSENTIALLY BE BROUGHT HERE. 
CLEARLY, IF THEY ARE IN MORE 
DIFFICULTY, IF THEIR CONDITION 
IS WEAKER, THE MANY SPECIALISTS 
THAT THEY HAVE HERE WILL HAVE A 
TOUGHER JOB. IN TERMS OF ANY 
TREATMENT GOING ON, THAT IS NOT 
CLEAR.  
>> CERTAINLY REASSURING THAT 
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR WAY TO THE 
HOSPITAL. 
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DEGREE 
OF RELIEF ON BEHALF OF THE 
FAMILIES, IS THERE ANY WORD 
FROM THEM? 
>> Reporter: WE DON'T KNOW IF 
THEY ARE HERE, CERTAINLY FOR 
THE PAST TWO WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN 
THEM IN DIFFERENT PLACES AROUND 
THE CAVE COMPLEX, THEY HAVE 
BEEN IN THEIR OWN TUCKED AWAY 
AREA AND KEPT UP-TO-DATE WITH 
THE LATEST INFORMATION. THEY 
WOULD'VE BEEN THE FIRST TO KNOW 
AND WOULD'VE BEEN GIVEN ALL OF 
THE UPDATES FROM THE DIVERS AND 
RESCUE TEAMS AS THEY STARTED 
THIS OPERATION AND DECIDED TO 
CONTINUE WITH IT. 
IT MAY BE THAT FAMILY MEMBERS 
ARE INSIDE NOW. 
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE 
OR WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE 
TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONES YET. 
CLEARLY, A DREADFUL ORDEAL, TWO 
WEEKS NOW THEY HAVE BEEN HAVING 
TO COPE WITH THIS. 
FIRST, THERE WAS THE DREADFUL 
SENSATION OF NOT KNOWING WHAT 
HAD HAPPENED, FOR NINE DAYS THE 
BOYS WERE TRAPPED AND FINALLY 
THE TWO BRITISH AMATEUR DIVERS 
WERE ABLE TO LOCATE THEM AND 
THEN BASICALLY TELL THE WORLD 
THAT THEY HAD BEEN FOUND. 
IN TERMS OF THE REACTION FROM 
THE FAMILIES, WE HAVE NOT SEEN 
THAT REACTION YET. 
THIS IS STILL IN THE EARLY 
DAYS, ONLY FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT TO SAFETY. 
13 WERE IN THE PARTY. 
CLEARLY A LONG WAY TO GO.  
>> WE ARE WATCHING FOR 
DEVELOPMENTS, TAKING A STEP 
BACK, THIS REALLY HAS BROUGHT 
THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, HASN'T 
IT, WE HEAR ARE UTTERLY 
GRIPPED, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW 
EMOTIONALLY CHARGED THINGS ARE 
THERE IN THAILAND? 
>> Reporter: THAILAND AS A 
NATION HAS BEEN PRAYING FOR THE 
BEST, FEARING THE WORST. 
IF YOU SPEAK WITH THE PEOPLE 
THAT LIVE HERE, THEY ARE AS 
ONE, THEY ARE SO DETERMINED 
THAT THESE BOYS SHOULD BE 
RESCUED. 
WE MET SOME OF THE WELL-
WISHERS, THE VOLUNTEERS AT THE 
SITES. 
THEY CREATED A COMMUNITY THERE 
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS AND THE 
SENSE OF OPTIMISM WHEN THEY 
HEARD THAT THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 
LOCATED, THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, 
THERE WAS AN ENERGY WHICH 
FLOWED THROUGH THE SITE. 
REALLY, THAT HAS SUSTAINED SO 
MANY PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING 
EXTREMELY LONG SHIFTS. IF YOU 
LOOK IN THE EYES OF SOME OF THE 
RESCUERS AND DIVERS, THEY WERE 
SHATTERED AND CONTINUED AND 
SAID THEY WOULD KEEP GOING FOR 
AS LONG AS IT TAKES. 
CLEARLY, IF WE HAVE NEWS IN THE 
COMING HOURS THAT ALL OF THESE 
BOYS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE 
BROUGHT OUT TO SAFETY, THERE 
WILL BE UNDER JUBILATION. 
WE ARE A LONG WAY TO GO. FOUR 
BOYS SO FAR, 13 IN ALL. 
THIS IS VERY MUCH THE FOCUS FOR 
THE COMING HOURS. 
>> I'M ASSUMING THIS WILL GO ON 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT? 
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY, WE 
JUST HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE 
FROM THE AUTHORITIES AND THEY 
GAVE AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE 
IMMEDIATE DETAILS. 
WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
COLLEAGUES AT THE SCENE, AT THE 
CAVE COMPLEX ABOUT ONE HOUR BY 
CAR FROM HERE. 
THEY HAVE SEEN THE VARIOUS 
AMBULANCES DRIVE PAST AND OUT 
TOWARDS THE MAIN ROAD. 
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN HELICOPTERS 
TAKE OFF. 
WE DO EXPECT MORE BOYS TO BE 
BROUGHT HERE, CERTAINLY WHEN 
MORE BOYS ARE TAKEN OUT THEY 
WILL BE BROUGHT HERE, REMEMBER, 
THIS WILL BE AN EXTREMELY LONG 
OPERATION. 
TO REACH THE BOYS WHERE THEY 
WERE AND BACK AGAIN, THAT HAS 
TAKEN DIVERS 11 HOURS. 
THIS IS A HUGE JOURNEY. 
I CAN TELL YOU, DURING THE 
WEEK, WE WERE ABLE TO GO TO A 
CAVE ABOUT 10 KILOMETERS AWAY 
FROM THE SPOT WHERE THE BOYS 
WERE TRAPPED. 
WE GOT A GLIMPSE OF THAT PLACE 
AND I CAN TELL YOU, IT WAS 
CLAUSTROPHOBIC, IT WAS HOT, THE 
WATER WAS MURKY. 
IF IT WAS FLOODED, THERE 
WOULD'VE BEEN NO VISIBILITY 
WHATSOEVER. 
WE DID RECEIVE INFORMATION 
EARLIER FROM THE THAI NAVY 
TEAMS. 
THEY ARE EXPLAINING THAT EACH 
BOY WOULD BE USHERED, OR 
SHEPHERDED THROUGH BY TWO EXPERT
DIVERS. 
THE BOYS WOULD REALLY FEEL 
THEIR PRESENCE AS THEY WERE 
MOVED ALL THE WAY THROUGH. 
THERE WAS A GUIDE ROPE THAT WAS 
SET UP AND RATHER THAN BE ABLE 
TO LOOK WHERE YOU ARE GOING, 
PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO MOVE 
THROUGH BIT BY BIT. 
ALSO, OF COURSE, THE CORE DOORS 
ARE SO NARROW, THAT WAS PART OF 
THE PROBLEM. 
IT WAS NOT JUST GOING OUT AT 
ONE ANGLE. 
THEY WERE GOING UP, DOWN, AND 
SOME OF THE BEST CAVE DIVERS IN 
THE WORLD SAID IT WAS A TOUGH 
CHALLENGE FOR THEM . 
>> AS WILL JUST REMIND YOU HOW 
THINGS HAVE UNFOLDED. 
THE MISSION TO RESCUE THOSE 12 
BOYS AND THEIR FOOTBALL COACH 
BEGAN AROUND 10 AM LOCAL TIME. 
WE KNOW AT LEAST FOUR BOYS WERE 
BROUGHT TO SAFETY. 
THEY ARE CURRENTLY AT THE LOCAL 
CHANG RAI HOSPITAL. 
FOR THE TIME BEING, THE 
OPERATION HAS COME TO A CLOSE. 
I HAVE SEEN A FACEBOOK POST 
FROM THE THAI NAVY SEALS WISHING
THEM SUPPORT. 
PLENTY MORE ON THE WEBSITE ON 
OUR LIVE PAGE. 
IF YOU WANT TO GET IN TOUCH 
WITH ME, YOU CAN FIND ME ONLINE.
>>> 
HELLO EVERYONE, I AM MEG 
OLIVER, THANK YOU FOR JOINING 
US, THE RESCUE OPERATION IS 
FINALLY UNDERWAY IN THAILAND, 
THE THAI NAVY SAYS FOUR OF THE 
12 YOUNG SOCCER PLAYERS TRAPPED 
INSIDE A FLOODED CAVE HAVE BEEN 
BROUGHT TO SAFETY SO FAR, THERE 
ARE EIGHT KIDS LEFT TO SAVE ON 
THE 25-YEAR-OLD COACH. 
THEY MAY NEED TO WAIT A BIT 
LONGER AS CREWS PREPARE FOR THE 
NEXT PHASE OF THE OPERATION. 
FOR NOW, THOSE THAT ARE OUT 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL 
FOR TREATMENT. 
IT IS TENTATIVE BUT THEY ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE OKAY. 
THAT IS DESPITE MORE THAN TWO 
WEEKS STUCK IN PLACE, OFTEN IN 
THE DARK WITH DECLINING OXYGEN 
AND LIMITED RESOURCES. 
AT FIRST, THE BOYS WERE 
MISSING, WHEN THEY WERE FOUND, 
CREWS DISOVERED THAT GETTING 
THEM OUT WOULD NOT BE EASY. 
TODAY'S EFFORTS ARE THE 
CULMINATION OF SEVERAL DAYS OF 
WORK IN DIFFICULT CONDITIONS 
THAT HAVE CLAIMED THE LIFE OF 
AT LEAST ONE RESCUER. 
THE DANGER IS FAR FROM OVER. 
CBS NEWS, FOREIGN 
CORRESPONDENT, BEN TRACY, SPOKE 
WITH MARKET BRENNAN -- MARGARET 
BRENNAN ABOUT THE LATEST 
DEVELOPMENTS IN CHANG RAI. 
>> Reporter: THIS IS THE NEWS 
WE HAVE BEEN HOPING TO HEAR, 
FOUR BOYS OUT OF THE CAVE AFTER 
16 LONG DAYS, WE BELIEVE ALL 
FOUR OF THEM WERE TRANSPORTED 
TO THE HOSPITAL IN CHIANG RAI 
VIA HELICOPTER AND THEN 
AMBULANCE. 
WE DID SEE THE HEAD OF THE 
RESCUE OPERATION GIVEN NEWS 
CONFERENCE, HE SAID IT WAS MORE 
SUCCESSFUL THAN THEY THOUGHT IT 
WOULD BE AND IT WENT  SMOOTHLY. 
FROM THE TIME THE BOYS EXITED 
THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE TO WHEN 
THEY GOT ON THE HELICOPTER WAS 
JUST 2 MINUTES. 
HE SAID THAT WAS FIVE TIMES 
FASTER THAN WHEN THEY TRIED 
THIS IN REHEARSALS. 
THEY ARE FEELING VERY CONFIDENT 
TONIGHT THAT THE FIRST STAGE OF 
THE OPERATION GETTING FOUR BOYS 
OUT OF THE CAVE HAS GONE 
EXTRAORDINARILY WELL. MARGARET? 
>> WHY DID THE RESCUE OPERATION 
HAPPEN NOW AND WHAT IS NEXT? 
>> Reporter: WILL YOU KNOW, 
THEY REALLY FELT A SENSE OF 
URGENCY, THEY FELT LIKE THEY 
HAD A SMALL WINDOW OF TIME TO 
ATTEMPT THIS. 
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS NOT THE 
PREFERRED MODE OF DOING THIS, 
THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS 
OPERATION TO BRING THESE YOUNG 
BOYS OUT OF THE CAVE, THEY ARE 
11-16, AND THIS IS THE WAY A 
TRAINED NAVY SEAL WOULD DO 
THIS. 
THE REASON THEY DID THIS IS 
THEY FELT THAT WITH HEAVY RAIN, 
AND IT IS RAINING AGAIN, THERE 
COULD BE FLOODING AGAIN AND CUT 
THE BOYS OFF FROM SUPPLIES OR 
SUCCESSFUL RESCUE CHANCES. 
THAT COULD POTENTIALLY MEAN 
THEY WOULD BE IN THE CAVE FOR 
MONTHS ON A SMALL PIECE OF REAL 
ESTATE THAT WOULD SHRINK AS THE 
CAVE FLOODED. 
THEY FELT LIKE THEY HAD A 
LITTLE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY 
WITH THE WEATHER, THEY FELT THE 
BOYS WERE IN THE RIGHT 
CONDITION TO WITHSTAND THE 
OPERATION. 
SO FAR, THEY HAVE BEEN RIGHT. 
THESE FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN OUT 
AND WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO 
BELIEVE THEY ARE ALL ALIVE, WE 
DO NOT HAVE ANY SENSE OF THEIR 
ACTUAL CONDITION IN TERMS OF 
WHAT KIND OF SHAPE THEY ARE IN. 
THEY WILL BE EVALUATED IN THE 
HOSPITAL FOR 3-5 DAYS. 
>> PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP 
TWEETED THIS MORNING THAT THE 
U.S. IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH 
THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND TO 
GET THE CHILDREN OUT. 
HE SAID SOME VERY BRAVE AND 
TALENTED PEOPLE ARE AT WORK AND 
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THOSE 
EFFORTS? 
>> Reporter: WE HAVE BEEN 
SITTING OUTSIDE THE CAVE AND 
SEEN U.S. PERSONNEL THERE ON 
THE SITE THERE IN VARIOUS 
CAPACITIES AS ADVISORS. 
WE ARE TOLD THAT THERE WERE 
AMERICAN DIVERS IN THE WATER AS 
PART OF THE RESCUE. 
THIS WAS AN INTERNATIONAL EFFORT
AND A TEAM OF 18 DIVERS, FIVE 
OF WHICH FROM THAILAND, THE 
REST WERE INTERNATIONAL. 
YOU HAD THE U.S., BRITAIN, 
AUSTRALIA. 
THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT 
HAS CAPTIVATED THE WORLD AND 
COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD 
AND PERSONNEL. 
JUST BEING THERE ON THAT SITE 
AND SEEING HOW MANY PEOPLE 
SHOWED UP TO HELP IN 70 
DIFFERENT CAPACITIS. 
IT IS QUITE STRIKING AND I'M 
SURE THAT IS A BIG PART OF THE 
SUCCESS SO FAR. 
>> BEN, THE RESCUE IS RISKY, 
THE ALTERNATIVES ARE REALLY 
TOUGH FOR THOSE PARENTS THAT 
HAVE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR ABOUT 
THEIR LOVED ONES. 
I KNOW YOU HAVE SPOKEN WITH 
SOME OF THEM, WHAT ARE THEY 
THINKING RIGHT NOW AS THIS IS 
UNDERWAY? 
>> Reporter: I CAN ONLY 
IMAGINE, WE SPOKE WITH THE 
FATHER OF THE YOUNGEST BOY IN 
THE CAVE, HE IS ONLY 11 YEARS 
OLD, HIS NAME IS TITAN, WE 
SPOKE WITH HIS DAD AND HE SAYS, 
THIS HAS BEEN HORRIBLE, IT HAS 
BEEN NERVE-RACKING EVERY DAY TO 
SIT THERE WAITING FOR NEWS. 
FIRST IT WAS THEY COULD NOT 
FIND THE BOYS, THEN ONCE THEY 
FOUND THEM, THE SENSE OF 
ELATION THAT THE PARENTS HAD, 
THEN TO FIND OUT THAT THE 
RESCUE MISSION WOULD BE 
HORRIBLY DANGEROUS, IT HAS 
REALLY BEEN A ROLLER COASTER 
FOR THESE FAMILIES. 
I CAN TELL YOU, AT THE CAVE 
SITE THERE WAS BASICALLY A TENT 
WHERE MOST OF THE FAMILY 
MEMBERS, MOST OF THE MOTHERS 
WERE SITTING IN CHAIRS WATCHING 
TELEVISION COVERAGE JUST 
WAITING FOR NEWS ABOUT THEIR 
KIDS. TODAY THEY WERE STANDING 
AT THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE AS THE 
OPERATION WAS HAPPENING. 
THEY WILL NOW BE REUNITED WITH 
THEIR SONS AT THE HOSPITAL.  
>> HOW MUCH ANGER IS THERE AT 
THE SITUATION ITSELF? 
I KNOW THE BOYS WERE BEING 
SUPERVISED, THEY HAD A SOCCER 
COACH WITH THEM, HE HAS BEEN 
HEAVILY CRITICIZED FOR PUTTING 
THEM IN THIS POSITION IN THE 
FIRST PLACE, IS HE REALLY TO 
BLAME HERE? 
>> Reporter: LET ME SET THE 
SCENE, THE SOCCER TEAM HAD 
FINISHED THEIR PRACTICE, FROM 
WHAT WE WERE TOLD BY MULTIPLE 
PEOPLE IN THAILAND, THERE WAS 
SOME SORT OF BIRTHDAY 
CELEBRATION THAT WAS HAPPENING, 
THAT IS WHY THEY WERE GOING TO 
THE CAVE. 
THEY WERE CELEBRATING SOMEONE'S 
BIRTHDAY. 
THEY WENT TO THE CAVE, THE 
COACH APPARENTLY WAS WITH THEM. 
THERE ARE BIG SIGNS OUTSIDE THE 
CAVES WARNING OF THE DANGER 
DURING THIS TIME OF YEAR DURING 
THE RAINY SEASON THAT THE CAVE 
CAN FLOOD AND BE UNSAFE. 
CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING THE 
COACH WILL NEED TO HER BREASTS 
-- ADDRESS AT SOME POINT. 
THE COACH DID ISSUE AN APOLOGY 
VIA A LETTER IN THE PARENTS AND 
KIDS WERE SENDING LETTERS BACK 
AND FORTH THE OTHER DAY AND 
SEVERAL OF THE PARENTS WENT OUT 
OF THEIR WAY TO SAY WE DO NOT 
BLAME YOU, TAKE CARE OF OUR 
KIDS, WE KNOW THAT YOU LOVE 
THEM, WE KNOW YOU ARE TRYING TO 
PROTECT THEM. 
WE HEARD REPORTS THAT THIS 
COACH WHEN THEY WENT IN WITH 
LITTLE FOOD, I IMAGINE THEY HAD 
SOME SNACKS BECAUSE THEY HAD 
BEEN PLAYING SOCCER, HE 
APPARENTLY GAVE ALL OF THE FOOD 
AND WATER TO KEEP THEM ALIVE. 
AND WE ARE TOLD HE IS IN ONE OF 
THE WEAKEST CONDITIONS OF 
ANYONE IN THE CAVE. 
HE CERTAINLY HAS DONE HIS BEST, 
HE APPARENTLY TAUGHT THEM HOW 
TO MEDITATE AND TRY TO KEEP 
THEM CALM AND CONSERVE THEIR 
ENERGY AND NOT PANIC WHILE THEY 
WERE INSIDE.  
>>> SUCH INCREDIBLE REPORTING 
FROM BEN TRACY IN THAILAND, WE 
WILL GO BACK NOW TO THE BBC FOR 
THE LATEST. 
>>> OUR CORRESPONDENT, DAN 
JOHNSON IS IN THAM LUANG NEAR 
THE EXIT OF THE TUNNEL. 
IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT IS 
RAINING, THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS? 
>> Reporter: IT STARTED RAINING 
REALLY HEAVILY HERE IN THE LAST 
HOUR, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 
THE AUTHORITIES HAVE BEEN 
FEARING ALL WEEK. 
THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE 
RESCUE MISSION, THE ATTEMPT TO 
GET THE BOYS OUT WAS STARTED 
THIS MORNING BECAUSE THE FEAR 
WAS THAT IF HEAVY RAIN 
PERSISTED IT COULD RAISE THE 
WATER LEVEL IN THE CAVE AND PUT 
THE BOYS AT RISK. 
THAT IS WHY THE AUTHORITIES 
THOUGHT WAS THE PRIME 
OPPORTUNITY TO START. 
THEY ARE TRYING TO TEACH THESE 
BOYS AS MUCH AS THEY CAN AND 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE 
THEM AFFILIATED. FOUR BOYS HAVE 
SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATED THE 
TORTUROUS PATH AND HAVE HAD TO 
NAVIGATE THROUGH DARK AND 
NARROW CHANNELS. 
ONE DIVER WHOSE EXPERIENCED 
THESE CONDITIONS IN THE CAVE SAY
THE PARTS OF THIS JOURNEY ARE 
LIKE BEING FLUSHED TO THE YOU 
BEND OVER TOILET. 
IT IS NARROW AND YOU ARE WINDING
AROUND DIFFERENT OBSTRUCTIONS 
WITH RUSHING WATER AND 
SOMETIMES THE TIDE RUSHING 
AGAINST THE BOYS. 
THEY REALLY HAVE SOME TOUGH 
CHALLENGES TO GET THROUGH. THE 
OPERATION HAS PAUSE FOR THE 
EVENING. 
AS YOU CAN SEE, VEHICLES ARE 
STILL COMING AND GOING BECAUSE 
THERE IS A NEED TO SUPPLY MORE 
EQUIPMENT AND CHANGE TEAMS 
OVER. 
THE SUPPORT TEAM WILL BE HERE 
ALL NIGHT REGARDLESS. 
TOMORROW MORNING THEY WILL 
RESTART IN EARNEST THE MISSION 
TO FREE THE REMAINING EIGHT 
BOYS AND THEIR COACH. 
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ALTHOUGH 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME SUCCESS 
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF RISK 
AND DANGER IN THE OPERATION. 
THERE IS A HUGE CHALLENGE STILL 
TO ACCOMPLISH TO MAKE SURE THAT 
EVERYONE GETS OUT SAFELY. 
>> DAN, THERE IS NOW A 10 HOUR 
BREAK, ARE THEY USING THIS SAME 
DIVE TEAM FOR THE NEXT STAGE? 
>> Reporter: WE UNDERSTAND IT 
IS A SMALL TEAM THAT HAS COME 
HERE AND THERE ARE 13 
INTERNATIONAL DIVE EXPERTS 
WORKING WITH FIVE ELITE DIVERS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR 
TRAINING THE BOYS AND THEY HAVE 
THE ABILITY AND STRENGTH TO 
MAKE IT OUT ALIVE AND THEY 
DECIDED WHICH BOYS WILL GO 
FIRST. 
THEY DECIDED TO TAKE THE 
WEAKEST FIRST AND THE ONES THEY 
THOUGHT NEEDED TO GET OUT FIRST 
AND THEY HAVE ESCORTED THESE 
BOYS OUT AND IT TOOK PROBABLY 
NINE HOURS FOR THEM TO GET OUT 
OF THE CABIN AND EVERYONE IS 
AWARE OF HOW TRICKY AND 
COMPLICATED THIS IS AND THE 
DIVE TEAM IS HAVING SOME REST 
AND SLEEP AND REGAINING THEIR 
ENERGY AND THEY ARE READY TO 
COME BACK TOMORROW FOCUSED AND 
READY TO APPLY THEIR EXPERTISE 
TO MAKE SURE THE REMAINING BOYS 
AND THEIR COACH CAN BE ESCORTED 
OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, BUT 
ALSO AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE 
BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF 
DANGER AND UNCERTAINTY IN THIS 
RESCUE ATTEMPT.  
>> DAN, BEFORE WE LET YOU GET 
OUT OF THE RAIN, WHILE THE TEAM 
IS HAVING THE BREAK, DOES THIS 
MEAN THAT PUMPING OPERATIONS 
WILL RESUME AND CONTINUE? 
>> Reporter: THEY HAVE BEEN 
PUMPING WATER ALMOST 
CONTINUOUSLY SINCE THIS WHOLE 
THING STARTED MORE THAN TWO 
WEEKS AGO JUST TO KEEP THE 
WATER LEVEL IN THE CAVE STABLE. 
THEY HAVE HAD TO PUMP MILLIONS 
OF LITERS OF WATER PER DAY AND 
THAT CONTINUES. 
SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU 
HAVE SEEN GOING IN COULD HAVE 
BEEN MORE GENERATORS AND PUMPS 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO KEEP 
CHURNING THAT EQUIPMENT TO MAKE 
SURE THERE IS POWER. THERE HAS 
BEEN A TORRENT OF WATER RUNNING 
DOWN FROM THE CAVE THAT THEY 
HAVE BEEN PUMPING OUT FOR THE 
LAST TWO WEEKS AND THEY HAVE 
STARTED TO DIG A RESERVOIR TO 
TAKE THE WATER SO IT DOES NOT 
CAUSE PROBLEMS ELSEWHERE. 
IT NEVER SEEMED TO BE REALISTIC 
THAT THEY COULD DRAIN ENOUGH 
WATER OUT OF THE CAVE FOR THE 
BOYS TO WALK OUT. 
YOU COULD'VE HEARD EARLY ON úTH 
AND SITTING THIS OUT BUT THAT 
COULD'VE TAKEN MONTHS. 
IN THE MEANTIME, THERE IS RISK 
OF RAIN FORCING THE WATER LEVEL 
UP. 
THERE WAS THE OPTION OF 
DRILLING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND 
THEY DID DRILL EXPLORATORY 
HOLES TRYING TO FIND THE 
SHORTEST DISTANCE TO REACH THE 
CABIN BUT IT WAS AT LEAST 600 
METERS AND THE NATURE OF THE 
MOUNTAIN IT'S ENVIRONMENT MAKES 
IT TOUGH WITH THICK AND STEEP 
HILLS AND THICK VEGETATION. 
THE SCUBA DIVING OPTION, 
SWIMMING OUT THE WAY THAT THEY 
CAME IN AND WALKED IN TWO WEEKS 
AGO IS THE WAY THAT WAS PUT 
INTO ACTION AND WAS FAVORED. 
THEY HAVE PROVEN THAT THAT CAN 
WORK AND THEY WILL CARRY ON 
DOING THAT TOMORROW WITH 
EVERYONE HOPING THAT THE REST 
OF THE GROUP WILL SUCCEED SO 
THAT EVERYONE CAN CELEBRATE 
WHEN 13 PEOPLE ARE SAFELY OUT 
OF THE CAVE. 
>> THAT IS DAN JOHNSON AT THE 
THAM LUANG CAVE COMPLEX, THANK 
YOU . 
>>> OUR CORRESPONDENT NICK 
BECAUSE AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE 
THE BOYS WERE TAKEN, NICK, WHAT 
CAN YOU UPDATE US WITH? 
>> Reporter: THEY WERE CERTAINLY
WAITING FOR GOOD NEWS AND FOR 
THEIR PATIENTS TO ARRIVE, 2.5 
HOURS AGO, THE MEDICAL TEAMS AT 
THE HOSPITAL, THE MAIN HOSPITAL 
HERE IN THE CHIANG RAI REGION, 
RECEIVED THE FIRST OF THE 
PATIENTS. 
WE SAW TWO AMBULANCES COME TO 
THE  ENTRANCE, THEY MOVE THE 
RAILINGS ASIDE AND WE ALSO 
LATER HEARD TWO AMBULANCES OVER 
HER -- OVERHEAD, TWO BOYS WERE 
BROUGHT IN THROUGH ANOTHER 
AMBULANCE -- ENTRANCE. 
THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING AND HAVE 
HAD MEDICAL TEAMS ASSESS THEIR 
HEALTH FOR THE LAST WEEK OR SO. 
THE DOCTOR WAS DOWN IN THE CAVE 
WITH THEM AFTER THEY WERE FOUND 
BY THE AMATEUR BRITISH DIVERS. 
THEY HAVE BEEN ASSESSING THEIR 
CONDITION DAILY AND THIS 
MORNING THE DECISION WAS MADE 
TO GO FOR THE ATTEMPT. 
THE BELIEVED THE BOYS WERE 
STRONG ENOUGH MENTALLY AND 
PHYSICALLY. IN TERMS OF HOW 
THEY ARE DOING NOW, THAT IS 
WHAT WE WERE TOLD. 
THE INDICATIONS THAT WE WERE 
TOLD IS THAT THEY ARE DOING 
WELL CONSIDERING EVERYTHING 
THAT HAS HAPPENED. 
THIS IS A HUGE ORDEAL, IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT THE PATH THAT THEY 
TOOK TO GET OUT OF THE CAVE, 
EXTREMELY NARROW IN PLACES, 
VISIBILITY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT 
AS WELL, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO 
SEE THINGS IN FRONT OF YOU, THE 
FACT THAT FOUR BOYS ARE OUT 
THIS EVENING HAS GIVEN MANY 
PEOPLE HOPE IN THAILAND.  
>>, UNDERSTANDABLY, THE 
HOSPITALS AND THE AUTHORITIES 
HAVE BEEN KEEN TO THE PART OF 
THE PRIVACY OF THE FAMILIES AND 
THE BOYS AS WELL. 
THERE WAS A LOT OF SCREENING 
AND SECURITY PRESENT OUTSIDE 
THE HOSPITAL, AS IT DIE DOWN? 
>> Reporter: CERTAINLY THERE 
ARE FEWER MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA 
HERE, THAT OBVIOUSLY IS A RESULT
OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE ONE 
HOUR AGO WHERE THEY SAID THEY 
WILL NOT BE ANY MORE 
OPERATIONS, THERE WILL BE A 
LITTLE IN THE RESCUE EFFORTS 
BECAUSE AS DAN WAS SAYING, 
THESE ARE SPECIALIZED PEOPLE, A 
SMALL CORE OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
THE SKILLS TO GET TO THE PLACE 
WHERE THE BOYS HAVE BEEN 
TRAPPED. 
THEY NEED TO REST OVERNIGHT. 
WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON 
INSIDE OF THE HOSPITAL NOW. 
CERTAINLY, THE PARENTS THAT YOU 
MENTIONED, THEY HAVE BEEN AT 
THE RESCUE SITE FOR THE PAST 
TWO WEEKS AND HAVE BEEN KEPT UP-
TO-DATE WITH ALL OF THE 
INFORMATION. 
IF THEY ARE HERE TONIGHT, 
CLEARLY THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
TOLD BEFORE ANYONE ELSE WHAT IS 
HAPPENING IT WAS INTERESTING, 
WE HEARD FROM ONE SOURCE 
EARLIER ON THAT THEY HAVE 
MANAGED TO HAVE PART OF THE 
HOSPITAL SEALED OFF SO THAT THE 
BOYS COULD BE BROUGHT IN, 
TREATED, AND UNDERGO ROUTINE 
EXAMINATIONS, BLOOD TESTING, 
URINE TESTING, LOOKING TO SEE 
IF THEY HAVE ANY INFECTION DUE 
TO BEING IN THE WATER WHICH IS 
EXTREMELY DIRTY AND MURKY. 
WE MAY GET MORE INFORMATION 
ABOUT THEIR CONDITION OVERNIGHT 
OR IN THE MORNING, BUT THIS IS 
ONGOING AND REMEMBER, IT TAKES 
THE MOST EXPERIENCED DIVERS TO 
GET WHERE THE BOYS ARE AND THIS 
IS A MARATHON OPERATION.  
>> THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE. 
NICK THERE WAS JUST OUTSIDE THE 
LOCAL HOSPITAL WHERE THE BOYS 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO. LET'S SPEAK 
NOW TO REUTERS BANGKOK DEPUTY 
BUREAU CHIEF, AMY, THANK YOU 
FOR JOINING US, ONE OF THE 
BIGGEST STORIES POSSIBLY THAT 
THAILAND HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH? 
>> Reporter: YES, CERTAINLY ONE 
OF THE BIGGEST STORIES IN YEARS 
FOR THAILAND, THIS IS A GOOD 
NEWS STORY SO FAR. 
THIS STORY DEFINITELY HAS 
BROUGHT THE COUNTRY TOGETHER, A 
COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN DIVIDED 
POLITICALLY FOR MANY YEARS. 
THIS IS A BIG STORY BUT ALSO A 
GOOD ONE. 
>> IN YOUR MEMORY, IT CAN YOU 
REMEMBER ANY STORY THAT HAS 
INVOLVED THIS LEVEL OF RESCUE 
OR COOPERATION INTERNATIONALLY, 
ALSO, THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF 
MILITARY INVOLVEMENT IN THIS 
OPERATION? 
>> Reporter: I DON'T THINK WE 
HAVE SEEN ANYTHING ON THIS SCALE
IN RECENT THAILAND HISTORY. 
REALLY, THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE 
OPERATION AND THERE'S MANY 
VOLUNTEERS AND TEAMS FLYING IN 
FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, 
AUSTRALIA, U.S., JAPAN TO NAME 
A FEW. 
THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION 
INVOLVED OVER THE PAST TWO 
WEEKS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS 
BEEN TRULY AMAZING. 
WE HAVE HEARD INTERNATIONAL 
TEENS COMMEND THE THAI PEOPLE 
-- TEAMS COMMEND THE THAI 
PEOPLE FOR THEIR EFFORTS. 
THE COUNTRY HAS NOT SEEN 
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.  
>> WHAT IS LOCAL PRESS BEEN 
SAYING AND HOW HAVE THEY 
COVERED THE STORY? 
>> Reporter: THE COVERAGE HAS 
BEEN BLANKET COVERAGE, NONSTOP. 
WHEN YOU GO TO THE STREETS, 
HERE IN THE CAPITAL, OR 
ELSEWHERE, PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE 
IN THAILAND, AND IN TALKING TO 
PEOPLE, ARE TALKING ABOUT THESE 
BOYS AND HAVE BEEN EVER SINCE 
THEY WERE FIRST TRAPPED IN THE 
CAVE. 
THE BIG HIGHLIGHT WAS WHEN THE 
TWO BRITISH DRIVE -- DIVERS 
FOUND THE BOYS LAST MONDAY. 
THAT WAS NEWS THAT WAS MET WITH 
A HUGE POSITIVE REACTION, AN 
AVALANCHE OF GOODWILL ON SOCIAL 
MEDIA. 
THAT REALLY HAS BROUGHT THE 
PEOPLE TOGETHER AT THIS TIME.  
>> AND WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, 
HOW BIG IS THIS SPORT OF CAVING 
IN THE COUNTRY? 
>> Reporter: WELL, IT IS FAIRLY 
POPULAR IN PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY, BUT IT IS DEFINITELY 
NOT A NATIONAL LEVEL SPORT, IT 
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT MANY 
PEOPLE DO. 
IN FACT, CYCLING IS PERHAPS THE 
BIGGEST SPORT IN THAILAND. 
THESE BOYS THAT WENT IN WERE 
NOT EXPERT CAVERS, THEY HAD 
BEEN THERE DURING THE DRY SEASON
THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME 
THEY HAVE GONE IN DURING THE 
RAINY SEASON. 
THEY WERE NOT EXPERTS BY ANY 
STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION. 
>> RESCUE OPERATIONS WILL 
RESUME AT 8 AM LOCAL TIME WHERE 
YOU ARE? 
>> Reporter: YES, THE CHIEF OF 
MISSIONS SAYS THAT IN ABOUT 10 
HOURS, JUST ABOUT NINE HOURS 
FROM NOW, THE RESCUE OPERATION 
WILL START AGAIN TO GET THE 
REMAINING BOYS AND ALSO THEIR 
ASSISTANT COACH OUT OF THE 
CHIANG RAI CAVE. 
WE HOPE TO SEE MORE PROGRESS 
TOMORROW  IF THE WEATHER STAYS 
ON THEIR SIDE. 
>> AMY, QUICKLY, IT HAS TO BE 
SAID THAT THE PARENTS HAVE COME 
ACROSS AS BEING QUITE CALM IN 
THIS, IS THIS JUST WITHIN THE 
THAI CHARACTER, OR HAVE THEY 
BEEN MORE VOCAL AND WISHES HAVE 
NOT HEARD THIS? 
>> Reporter: I THINK IT IS MANY 
FACTORS, THROUGHOUT THE 
OPERATION WE HAVE SEEN THE 
FAMILY CORDONED TO THE SIDE 
WITH THEIR OWN TENT, THEIR OWN 
SHELTER AND FOR THE MOST PART 
THEY HAVE HAD SEVERAL BUDDHIST 
MONKS WITH AN LEADING PRAYERS 
AND MEDITATION. I THINK THAT 
HAS HELPED THE PARENTS QUITE A 
LOT IN KEEPING THEM CALM AND 
GROUNDED. 
THEY HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR GOOD 
NEWS AND FINALLY IT CAME THAT 
THERE BOYS WERE FOUND. 
THIS IS A HUGE PART OF THE 
CALMNESS THAT WE HAVE SEEN.  
>> AMY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
SPEAKING TO US. SHE IS THE 
REUTERS BUREAU CHIEF. 
YOU'RE WATCHING BBC NEWS, LET'S 
GET A LITTLE MORE ON THIS 
STORY, FROM THE WORLD OF CAVE 
DIVING ITSELF, AN INSTRUCTOR, 
JEFF CROSSLEY IS JOINING US ON 
THE PROGRAM, HE IS ACTUALLY ONE 
OF THE DIVERS THAT RESCUED LES 
HEWITT FROM A YORKSHIRE CAVE IN 
1992 AND JOINS US LIVE FROM 
CAMBRIA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING 
US, WATCHING THESE EVENTS TAKE 
PLACE IN THAILAND, WHAT IS THIS 
DOING TO YOU WHEN YOU THINK 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN CAMBRIA? 
>> IT IS THE SAME RANGE OF 
EMOTIONS, YOUR CORRESPONDENT 
HAS PUT THIS WELL, IT IS 
ACTUALLY WONDERFUL NEWS, IT IS 
NOT OVER YET AND YOU HAVE TO BE 
CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC, WHEN 
THEY GO BACK INTO RESUME THE 
RESCUE OPERATION THEY NEED TO 
HOPE THINGS WILL GO WELL. 
>> IN TERMS OF CONDITIONS, ARE 
THEY SIMILAR AROUND THE WORLD 
ONCE YOU GET INSIDE A CAVE OR 
DO THEY DIFFER? 
>> Reporter: THEY DO DIFFER 
FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. 
I WOULD SAY FROM WHAT I AM 
HEARING FROM THE THAI 
OPERATION, THEY ARE QUITE 
SIMILAR TO BRITISH CONDITIONS 
AND THAT YOU HAVE POOR 
VISIBILITY AND SMALL PASSAGES. 
THE ONE PERHAPS GOOD THING 
ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OVER THERE 
IS THAT IT IS WARM, IT 
CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE WARM 
OVER HERE. 
THAT HAS BEEN A BIG PLUS IN 
HELPING TO GET THE BOYS OUT. 
>> YOU RESCUED LES HEWITT BACK 
IN 1992, THE TEAM HERE, OR 
RATHER THE TEAM IN THAILAND ARE 
HAVING TO RESCUE CHILDREN, WHAT 
WOULD BE YOUR PRIMARY CONCERN 
IF YOU ARE PART OF THAT TEAM? 
>> I THINK THAT IT WAS A VERY 
BIG TEAM EFFORT TO RESCUE LESS 
AND ROY DEAN AT THE TIME, I 
THINK WITH CHILDREN, YOUR 
CORRESPONDENT HAS SAID, IT IS 
ALREADY ABOUT PRIORITIZING WHO 
IS THE WEAKEST, WHO NEEDS TO 
GET OUT FIRST, WHO IS CONFIDENT
? WHO ARE THE MOST CONFIDENT? 
IT WOULD BE A CASE OF PUTTING 
THEM IN THE WATER PROBABLY WITH 
THE EQUIPMENT ATTACHED AND 
GIVING THE CHILD ROOM, NOT 
UNDER THE FLOODED PART OF THE 
CAVE, BUT IN THE WATER WHERE 
THEY ARE. 
I THINK THEY WOULD'VE WORKED 
ALL OF THAT OUT AND THEN SPLIT 
THEM INTO GROUPS TO DECIDE WHO 
WOULD BE THE BEST TO TAKE OUT 
FIRST AND THEN CARRY ON FROM 
THERE. 
IT APPEARS THAT IS WHAT THE 
CASE IS WHERE THEY HAVE NOW 
SUSPENDED OPERATIONS BECAUSE IT 
IS A STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE 
SEARCHING FOR MISSING PEOPLE IN 
THE FLOODED CAVE. 
WHEN YOU FIND THEM, AFTER THE 
INITIAL EUPHORIA, YOU REALIZE, 
THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY RESCUED 
UNTIL THEY ARE ALL OUT. 
I WOULD SAY THAT THEY OBVIOUSLY 
HAVE A PLAN, THEY ARE STICKING 
TO THAT PLAN AND THEY WILL 
RESUME AGAIN TOMORROW AND 
HOPEFULLY IT WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE SUCCESSFUL.  
>> AS THE OTHER RESCUER, JEFF, 
WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND? 
WHAT PRESSURES ARE YOU UNDER? 
>> YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR 
OWN SAFETY, IT IS A STRESSFUL 
TIME WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO GET 
SOMEONE OUT AND YOU ARE TRYING 
TO BE POSITIVE ALL THE TIME. 
YOU DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE 
SERIOUS DANGERS, I THINK THIS 
IS VERY MUCH A CASE OF FOCUS ON 
YOUR OWN SAFETY AS WELL AND 
REMAIN POSITIVE TO GIVE THE 
CONFIDENCE TO GET OUT.  
>> WHAT WARNING SIGNS ARE YOU 
LOOKING FOR? 
WE KNOW THAT THE WEAKEST BOYS 
WERE TAKEN OUT FIRST, DOESN'T 
THAT INCREASE THE RISK? WHAT 
HELP SIGNS ARE YOU KEEPING YOUR 
EYES OUT FOR? 
>> WELL, THAT IS DIFFICULT TO 
SAY FOR ME, I WOULD BE 
SPECULATING REGARDING HEALTH 
SIGNS. CERTAINLY, FROM MY 
EXPERIENCE ON RESCUES THAT I 
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH, WE 
WOULD MAINTAIN OR TRY AND 
MAINTAIN VISUAL CONTACT, WE 
WOULD TRY AND LOOK AT THEM BY 
ALMOST SWIMMING BACKWARDS WITH 
THOSE THAT WE BROUGHT OUT, TWO 
DIVERS PER PERSON, JUST LOOKING 
AT THEM, KEEPING THEM FOCUSED 
AND WATCHING FOR SIGNS OF PANIC 
RATHER THAN MEDICAL ISSUES. IF 
THE WATER IS QUITE SHALLOW, I 
THINK IT IS, THAT IS A GOOD 
THING. IF THE WATER IS VERY 
DEEP THAT IT DOES BECOME MORE 
OF AN ISSUE PHYSIOLOGICALLY.  
>> JEFF, DOESN'T IT ADD 
PRESSURE TO KEEP EYE CONTACT 
WITH SOMEONE THAT YOU ARE 
TRYING TO RESCUE? 
YOU ARE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD 
THAT YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY 
LOOK BACK TO MAINTAIN EYE 
CONTACT? 
WE ARE HEARING THAT THESE 
PASSAGES ARE JUST SO NARROW? 
>> YES, THERE ARE SECTIONS THAT 
ARE NARROW IN MOST CAVE 
PASSAGES. 
CERTAINLY, THAT IS ONE OF THE 
ISSUES WHEN YOU GET TO A NARROW 
PART. 
SINCE THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVES 
TO HOLD THEM THROUGH A NARROW 
PART WITHOUT GUIDANCE, YOU CAN 
BE THERE, YOUR PRESENCE CAN BE 
THERE, BUT MAYBE THE PHYSICAL 
CONTACT, OR THE EYE CONTACT 
MIGHT HAVE TO BE REMOVED FOR A 
FEW SECONDS.  
>> HOW DO YOU, AS YOU TRY TO DO 
THIS AND YOU SEE SIGNS OF 
PANIC, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? 
>> IT IS A CASE OF KEEP HOLD OF 
THEM. YOU ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE 
THAT PHYSICAL CONTACT TO MAKE 
SURE THAT YOU ARE THERE, YOU 
ARE REASSURING THEM ALL THE TIME
AND YOU ARE ALSO REASSURING 
THROUGH YOUR EYES TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU 
ARE NOT PANICKING, EVERYTHING 
IS OKAY, THEY ARE DOING WELL 
AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL RESPOND 
TO THAT IN-KIND. 
>> DEALING WITH CHILDREN, WOULD 
YOU HAVE TO KIND OF PULL THEM 
ALONG IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THEM
? THERE COULD BE A FEAR OF WATER
, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE 
CILDREN CANNOT SWIM? 
>> I DO NOT THINK THE SWIMMING 
ISSUES TOO MUCH OF A PROBLEM 
ACTUALLY. 
ONCE YOU GO TO A FLOODED 
PASSAGE THE BEST PLACE TO BE IS 
ON THE FLOOR OR THEREABOUTS IN 
THIS TYPE OF SITUATION. 
THEY WOULD PROBABLY BE WEIGHTED 
SUITABLY SO THEY ARE DOWN ON 
THE FLOOR AND LITERALLY 
CRAWLING OR WALKING ALONG THE 
FLOOR TO GET OUT. 
THE CHILDREN, I THINK WITH 
THESE BOYS, WE HAVE SEEN FROM 
THEIR TEMPERAMENT AND THE WAY 
THAT THEY HAVE CONDUCTED 
THEMSELVES, IT HAS BEEN AMAZING 
REALLY, I THINK THEY MIGHT WELL 
SEE THIS AS AN ADVENTURE AND 
HOPEFULLY THAT IS HOW THEY WILL 
SEE IT, AND A BIT OF A 
CHALLENGE, CLEARLY THEY ARE UP 
FOR THIS CHALLENGE BY THE FACT 
THAT THEY WENT INTO THESE 
CAVES, HOPEFULLY THEY WILL SEE 
IT LIKE THAT AND HAVE THE 
CONFIDENCE THAT IS REQUIRED. 
>> HOW DO YOU ENCOURAGE A 
CHILD? 
WHAT SORT OF COMMUNICATION 
METHODOLOGY WOULD YOU HAVE 
BEFORE GONG TO THE WATER? TUG 
ON THE WIRE, IF SOMETHING 
HAPPENS, IF YOU ARE WORRIED, IF 
YOU ARE BEGINNING TO PANIC, HOW 
DO YOU COMMUNICATE WITH THE 
CHILD? 
>> YOU CANNOT REALLY 
COMMUNICATE UNDERWATER APART 
FROM VISUAL SIGNALS. YOU CANNOT 
SPEAK WITH ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT 
SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, YOU 
WOULD NOT BE EQUIPPING NON-
DIVERS WITH THAT SORT OF 
EQUIPMENT AND YOU HAVE TO GET 
THEM AS CALM AS POSSIBLE BEFORE 
STARTING AND ONCE THE DIVE IS 
UNDERWAY IT IS MAINTAINING THE 
PHYSICAL AND VISUAL PRESENCE SO 
THEY KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS WITH 
THEM AT ALL TIMES.  
>> SINCE THE OPERATION, THE 
SUCCESSFUL OPERATION OF THE 
FOUR BOYS THAT WE DO KNOW HAVE 
EXITED THE CAVE, A LOT OF 
TRIBUTES HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE 
DIVER THAT LOST HIS LIFE THIS 
WEEK, HE LOST CONSCIOUSNESS, 
HOW DO YOU KNOW IF A CHILD IS 
LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS? 
>> THERE WOULD BE NO RESPONSE, 
OR THEY WOULD STOP MOVING IF 
THEY WERE LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS. 
YOU WOULD HAVE TO SPEED THINGS 
UP TO TRY AND GET THEM OUT, 
THERE ARE TWO DEATHS THAT CAN 
HAPPEN WHICH IS SLOW AND STOP. 
THIS IS A SLOW AND METICULOUS 
OPERATION BUT OBVIOUSLY IF 
SOMEONE'S LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS 
YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. 
VISIBILITY IS POOR, THAT IS AN 
ENEMY OF CAVE DIVING. THAT MAY 
NOT BE VERY APPARENT. 
YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE 
OUT ALL THE TIME. I WOULD SAY 
ACTUALLY, AT THIS POINT, WITH 
THE THAI DIVERS, THERE IS SOME 
SPECIAL MENTION TO THEM HAVING 
BEEN DOING A FANTASTIC JOB, 
THEY ARE REALLY NOT TRAINED 
CAVE DIVERS, IT IS WONDERFUL 
WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN THE WAY 
THAT THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THE 
OPERATION. 
>> IN TERMS OF THE GEAR THAT 
THE RESCUE TEAM AND THE 
CHILDREN WOULD BE WEARING, 
THERE IS SOME RISK THERE THAT 
THAT COULD GET DAMAGED AND ALSO 
THE AIRLINE THAT IS ATTACHED TO 
THE DIVER, HOW DO YOU ENSURE 
THAT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN? 
>> I DO NOT KNOW WHAT PLAN THEY 
PUT INTO PLACE OVER THERE 
REGARDING WHO WEARS THE 
EQUIPMENT AND WHERE THE AIR HOSE
IS GOING. I CAN ONLY RELATE TO 
OUR EXAMPLE WHICH IS THE 
CASUALTY THAT THEY WOULD 
SURRENDER. THIS IS PART OF 
BEING ACCOMPANIED BY TWO DIVERS.
THAT IS THE FIRST ONE AS THEY 
SAID EARLIER PERHAPS SWIMMING 
BACKWARDS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT 
AND FEEDING THE GUIDELINE TO 
THE CASUALTY. 
THE DIVER BEHIND WAS CONSTANTLY 
MAKING SURE THAT THE AIRLINE 
DID NOT CATCH ON ANY ROCK 
PROJECTIONS AND THE LINE DID 
NOT GET TANGLED ON ANY 
EQUIPMENT WHICH COULD STOP THE 
OPERATION COMPLETELY.  
>> WE NOW KNOW THAT THERE IS A 
10 HOUR REST PERIOD, WHY IS 
THAT NEEDED? 
WHAT ARE THEY DOING DURING THAT 
TIME? 
>> I THINK THEY HAVE BEEN 
WORKING FLAT-OUT, I THINK IT IS 
FAIRLY OBVIOUS THAT THEY HAVE 
BEEN WORKING FLAT-OUT AND I 
CANNOT EMPHASIZE HOW STRESSFUL 
IT WILL BE FOR THEM CONSIDERING 
THAT MOST OF THE DIVERS WILL 
NOT SPEAK THAI SO THEY 
CONSTANTLY NEED LANGUAGE 
TRANSLATIONS FED TO THEM. THEY 
JUST NEED REST AND RECUPERATION.
IT IS A GOOD THING THAT THE SAME
TEAM STICKS TOGETHER BECAUSE OF 
THE PLAN IS WORKING, THEN DO 
NOT CHANGE IT. I AM SURE THAT 
IS WHAT THEY HAVE DECIDED TO DO 
>> JEFF CROSSLEY, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR THE CHAT HERE 
ON  
>>> THEY ARE TAKING EFFORTS TO 
REMOVE -- TO RESCUE THE BOYS 
AND THEIR COACH. 
THE TUNNELS WERE WATERLOGGED. 
DIVERS WERE CALLED ON AND THEY 
HELPED TO FIND THE GROUP 
SHELTERING AROUND 2.5 MILES 
FROM THE MOUTH OF THE CAVE ON 
MONDAY. 
THE VAST CAVE NETWORK STRETCHES 
10 KILOMETERS INTO THE MOUNTAIN.
THE TUNNEL IS 1 MILE 
UNDERWATER. 
THE FIRST BOY WAS BROUGHT OUT 
OF THE CAVE AT AROUND MIDDAY 
OUR TIME. 
ALL OF THE FOUR RESCUE BOYS ARE 
BEING TREATED IN HOSPITALS. 
MORE RESCUE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN 
PAUSED TO ALLOW DIVERS TO 
PREPARE FOR THE MISSION. 
THE RESCUE TEAM HAS BEEN 
DREADING RAIN. 
IT APPEARS TO HAVE ARRIVED. 
IT IS, OF COURSE, MONSOON 
SEASON. 
LET'S SPEAK TO ANDY, THE FORMER 
HEAD OF THE BRITISH CAVING 
ASSOCIATION, JOINING US THROUGH 
THE WEB CAMERA. 
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS 
STORY AND TALKING TO US ON BBC 
NEWS. 
THIS LATEST DEVELOPMENT, WE 
HAVE HAD FOUR BOYS OUT. 
WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT? 
>> EUPHORIA. 
I THINK IT IS ABSOLUTELY 
WONDERFUL THAT THEY HAVE GOT 
FOUR OUT SAFELY AND IT SUGGESTS,
WITH A GREAT DEAL OF LUCK AND 
NOT TOO MUCH RAIN, THAT THEY 
CAN GET THE OTHER NINE OUT. 
SO FINGERS CROSSED. 
THE GREAT MOMENT LAST WEEK WAS 
ACTUALLY GETTING THROUGH AND 
FINDING THE BOYS AND FINDING 
ALL 13 OF THEM ALIVE. 
THAT WAS A WONDERFUL MOMENT. 
THE SECOND WONDERFUL MOMENT WAS 
GETTING THE FIRST OF THEM OUT 
INTACT AND LOOKING PRETTY GOOD. 
IN BETWEEN, UNFORTUNATELY, 
THERE WAS THIS DREADFUL 
DISASTER OF THE DIVER DYING, 
AND THAT UNDERLIES -- UNDERLINES
THE DANGER THAT THERE IS WITH 
THIS TYPE OF OPERATION. 
THE CAVE DIVERS REALIZE THIS 
SITUATION. 
THEY WILL BE CAREFUL AND CALM, 
COOL, AND COLLECTED. 
YOU WERE ASKING EARLIER WHAT 
THEY WILL BE DOING. 
THEY WILL BE RESTING. 
I HOPE THAT THEY WILL GET AS 
MUCH REST AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN 
TO ENABLE THEM TO GO BACK IN 
AND PERFORM THEIR OPERATION, 
BOTH SAFELY FOR THEMSELVES AND 
SAFELY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT THEY 
ARE RESCUING. 
>> IS A 10 HOUR PERIOD ENOUGH 
TO RELIEVE THE STRESS THAT THE 
HUMAN BODY IS PUT UNDER WHEN 
THEY ARE DIVING? 
IT IS NOT DEEPWATER BUT THERE 
ARE INCREDIBLE STRESSES BEING 
PUT ON THE DIVERS. 
>> I COULD SAY ONE COULD SAY. 
IT IS NOT REALLY ENOUGH. 
BUT THERE IS A LEVEL OF URGENCY.
I DO NOT KNOW QUITE WHAT 
DIFFERENCE THE RAIN WILL MAKE. 
I SUSPECT QUITE A SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCE IN MAKING IT LONGER 
UNDERWATER. 
THE UNDERWATER PASSAGES WILL 
BECOME LONGER. 
THE FLOODED SECTIONS WILL BE 
LONGER. 
THE AIRSPACE WILL BE SHORTER. 
IF IT IS POURING RAIN, THE 
SOONER THAT THEY GET IN AND GET 
THE REST OUT, THE BETTER. 
I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS A 
DANGER, AN IMMEDIATE DANGER, 
ANYWAY, OF THEM ACTUALLY 
FLOODING OUT WHERE THEY ARE AND 
GOING TO THE ROOFTOP AND REALLY 
GIVING THEM A LIFE-THREATENING 
PROBLEM. 
IT WILL CERTAINLY -- THE RAIN 
WILL MAKE THE RESCUING MORE 
DIFFICULT. 
I KNOW THAT THEY WILL THINK THE 
SOONER THE BETTER. 
THEY NEED TO REST. 
IT IS BALANCING THE TWO. 
>>> HOW FIT ARE THESE CHAPS? 
I AM ASSUMING THAT THEY ARE ALL 
MEN. 
>> I AM SORRY. 
I CANNOT HEAR YOU VERY WELL. 
>> HOW FIT ARE THESE DIVERS? 
>> THE DIVERS ARE VERY FIT. 
THEY ARE PHYSICALLY PRETTY FIT. 
RICK HAS JUST CANOODLE AROUND 
TASMANIA. 
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE PRETTY FIT 
TO DO THAT. 
THEY ARE FIT GUYS BUT THEY ARE 
VERY, VERY EXPERIENCED CAVE 
DIVERS. 
THOSE TWO WORDS ARE IMPORTANT. 
THEY ARE NOT JUST DIVERS AND 
JUST CAVERS. 
THEY ARE CAVE DIVERS. 
IT IS A DIFFERENT MINDSET WHEN 
YOU ARE UNDERWATER, 
UNDERGROUND, AND IT IS MORE OF 
A MIND EXERCISE THAN A PHYSICAL 
EXERCISE. 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE EXACTLY THE 
RIGHT FRAME OF MIND TO KEEP COOL
-- COOL AND CALM AND COLLECTED. 
THAT IS WHAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO 
DO. 
THESE BOYS ARE SHOWING A 
WONDERFUL FORTITUDE. 
FOR THEM TO KEEP CALM DURING 
THE NINE DAYS THAT THEY WERE IN 
COMPLETE DARKNESS IS WONDERFUL. 
THAT REALLY POINTS TO THE FACT 
THAT THEY ARE PROBABLY GOING TO 
BE PRETTY COOL AND CALM COMING 
OUT UNDERWATER. 
CERTAINLY THE FOUR COMING OUT 
NOW WILL HAVE OBVIOUSLY 
EXPERIENCED THAT. 
THEY GOT BACK SAFELY. 
RATES. 
THEY ARE COMING HOME, BRILLIANT.
>> YOU ARE TALKING THERE ABOUT 
MIND EXERCISE. 
ARE THERE CERTAIN TRICKS THAT 
THEY WOULD HAVE TAUGHT THE 
CHILDREN FROM THEIR OWN 
EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE? 
>> WELL, JEFF EARLIER WAS 
SAYING THAT THEY WILL BE 
SWIMMING THEM AROUND IN THE 
SWIMMING -- IN THE POOL, AND 
THEY WILL BE TRYING TO GET THEM 
CONFIDENT UNDERWATER. 
THE FACT THAT THEY CANNOT SWIM 
DOES NOT MATTER VERY MUCH. 
THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO 
VISIBILITY OF IT OR ALMOST NO 
VISIBILITY IN THE WATER IS A 
SHAME, BUT IT'S NOT A SERIOUS 
PROBLEM. 
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT THEY 
HAVE TO BE COMFORTABLE 
UNDERWATER. 
THESE BOYS HAVE TO BE 
COMFORTABLE UNDERWATER. 
NEVER HAVING BEEN WITH SCUBA 
GEAR ON BEFORE, TO PUT THEM 
UNDERWATER, LIKE THAT, IS 
OBVIOUSLY A STRESSFUL SITUATION.
I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY ARE 
YOUNG GUYS IS HELPFUL. 
ONE, THEY ARE SMALL. 
THEY GET THROUGH THE SMALL 
PLACES EASIER THAN THE LARGER 
PERSON. 
THEY CAN BE MANHANDLED BY THE 
DIVERS WITH THEM EASIER THAN A 
LARGER%. 
THEY HAVE NOT GOT THE LIFE 
EXPERIENCE, SO THEY PROBABLY DO 
NOT FULLY REALIZE THE EXTREME 
DANGER THAT THEY ARE IN. 
THOSE THINGS ARE FACTORS IN THE 
RIGHT DIRECTION. 
THE FACT THAT THEY GOT IN THERE 
TO START WITH SHOWS THAT THESE 
ARE PRETTY ADVENTUROUS KIDS. 
THEY GOT IN THIS PROBLEM 
BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING OVER 
ADVENTUROUS. 
THEY HAVE GOT TO BE OVER 
ADVENTUROUS TO GET THEMSELVES 
OUT. 
>> THEY HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE 
FOR A FORTNIGHT. 
THEY ARE IN A PRETTY WEAK 
STATE. 
THEY HAVE BEEN FED SINCE THEY 
HAVE BEEN FOUND. 
BUT GOING INTO THE WATER, WHAT 
IS THE PRIMARY CONCERN FOR 
SOMEBODY HAT IS TRYING TO GET 
THE BOYS OUT SAFELY? 
>> THE ABSOLUTE PRIMARY CONCERN 
WILL BE TO TRY AND KEEP THEM 
CALM AND GIVE THEM EVERY 
ASSURANCE THAT THEY POSSIBLY CAN
THAT THEY WILL BE IN SAFE HANDS 
UNDERWATER. 
THE BIGGEST DANGER THAT THEY 
HAVE BY A LONG WAY IS PANIC. 
IF THEY CAN JUST KEEP COOL AND 
CALM, THEY WILL GET OUT SAFELY. 
THE GEAR WILL BE GOOD. 
I MEAN, THE GEAR WILL HAVE BEEN 
VETTED BY THE TEAM AT DIVERS, 
AND IT WILL BE THE BEST 
AVAILABLE AND VERY RELIABLE. 
THEY WILL HAVE THE BEST SYSTEM 
THAT THEY CAN POSSIBLY HAVE. 
THE CAVE DIVERS ARE THE BEST 
THAT THERE ARE IN THE WORLD. 
EVERYTHING IS GOOD AS LONG AS 
THE BOYS DO NOT PANIC. 
THE GREAT DANGER IS THEM OVER 
WORRYING. 
AND AS I SAY, THERE ARE A LOT 
OF SIGNS TO SUGGEST THAT THEY 
ARE IN A REALLY GOOD FRAME OF 
MIND TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS. 
IT IS A GREAT TRIBUTE TO THIS 
FOOTBALL TEAM THAT THEY ARE 
ABLE TO DO THAT. 
THEY ARE FIT, YOUNG, NOT 
WORRYING. 
THAT IS GREAT. 
THAT IS WONDERFUL. 
I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC THAT, IN 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS, WE WILL GET 
THEM ALL OUT. 
IT DEPENDS ON THE WEATHER. 
THE WEATHER IS ABSOLUTELY 
CRITICAL IN THIS. 
IT WILL NOT BE RUSHED. 
WHETHER THEY CAN BRING MORE 
THAN FOUR OUT A DAY, I DON'T 
KNOW.  
CLEARLY THAT IS GOING TO TAKE 
ANOTHER THREE DAYS IF THEY CAN 
ONLY BRING FOUR HOURS. 
THEY MUST NOT RUN ANY OF THE 
DANGERS THAT COULD BE TEMPTING, 
LIKE PUTTING MORE RESCUE DIVERS 
IN WHO HAVE NOT
