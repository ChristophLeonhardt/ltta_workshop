“White House experience
really helps refine
what one might call
one’s ‘b.s. detector’
for determining when
the executive branch might
be exaggerating or misstating
how things actually work,
or the problems that
would supposedly
ensue from a particular
legal interpretation.
It gives you great respect
for the presidency.
But that doesn’t translate
into undue deference.
When Justice Kennedy
says something,
I listen —
me and 320 million 
other Americans.
If confirmed
to the D.C. Circuit,
I would follow 
Roe v. Wade
faithfully and fully,
that would be binding precedent
of the court.
It’s been decided
by the Supreme Court —”
“I asked you 
your own opinion —”
“And I’m saying,
if I were confirmed
to the D.C. Circuit,
Senator,
I would follow it.
It’s been reaffirmed
many times,
including in
Planned Parenthood versus —”
“I understand.
But what is your opinion?
You’re not 
on the bench yet.
You’ve talked about
these issues in the past
to other people,
I’m sure —”
“The Supreme Court has
held repeatedly, Senator,
and I don’t think it
would be —”
“O.K. —”
“appropriate for me to give a
personal view on that case —”
“Not going to answer
the question.”
“He’s been one of the most 
consequential jurists
in American history.
No doubt about it.
And his basic idea was:
Pay attention
to the words of
the Constitution
and pay attention to the
words of the statutes
that Congress passes.
A very simple and 
easily conveyed idea.
But it shows how far
the Supreme Court
had strayed from those ideas
before Justice Scalia
came on the scene.
The Constitution is
largely a document
of majestic specificity
and those specific words
have meaning, which absent
constitutional amendment,
continue to bind us as
judges, legislators
and executive officials.
The federal judiciary
is really, as I said, many times —
it’s one of the crown jewels,
if not the crown jewel
of our
constitutional democracy
and it ultimately depends 
on getting
good people willing to
become judges in our system.”
