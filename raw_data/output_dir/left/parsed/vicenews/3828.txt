I can head-banging but I can wanna
damage these headphones the impression
of the hallmark sounds of hip-hop but a
nightmare version or something like that
and because it was so hard to follow the
beat I found myself focusing on the the
words more some incredibly long phrases
I would be really amazed if he didn't
take a breath somewhere in there oh wow
I have always admired his
forward-thinking this is the craziest
beat I've ever heard from him
why be normal why not put the rules
through a paper shredder and then take
the strips of paper and weave them into
a new piece of paper and say this is our
song I first kept wondering is this
programmed or is this someone playing
this for real and I could never quite
tell I think that was perhaps some of
the most psychedelic music I've ever
heard
saw the life I left behind
there was one brief moment where I got a
chill and then it seemed like it was a
false chill and it might just be that I
got a little cold for a second I wanted
to hurt him made me cry it sounded very
personal so I couldn't be a universal
song bridge over troubled water
if you've ever cared about anybody in
your life that song is about you but
this is not that kind of clear
I really like that drum beat I mean I
could have been a drum machine for all I
know but there's a drama to it it's a
soundtrack quality to it that
intensifies everything around you it
makes your life into the movie the music
adding an emotional importance to even
very trivial mundane things that's a
really beautiful thing about music it
can make everyday life reveal itself to
be this incredible phenomenon
