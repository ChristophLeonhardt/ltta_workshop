when I first ran for Congress in 2012 against a sixteen year incumbent I was running proudly on reproductive rights and ending the drug war and ending the prohibition on marijuana and making sure that we are fulfilling our commitment to our servicemembers and celebrating our connection with Mexico El Paso is connected with co-op waters it forms the largest by national community in this Hemisphere and it's part of the reason that we are such a safe city today on any of those issues which could be controversial or contentious or maybe you know the pollsters would tell us not to talk about the people in El Paso were glad that someone was finally championing the things that they were thinking about or even if they disagreed with me they love the fact that I had formed an opinion come to a conclusion have thought it through and had the courage of my convictions and was willing to talk about it out on the campaign trail and I think the same holds true for Texas you know we talk about universal health care perhaps not the thing you're supposed to talk about running statewide in Texas or that medicare-for-all is the best articulation of how you get there right now but you know it's not just in Houston in Austin and Dallas in San Antonio the Rio Grande Valley in El Paso the conventionally blue communities it is in the rural parts of the state in Sherman Texas and Wichita Falls and Canyon and Booker and Pecos folks want to be able to see a doctor and make sure that their kids are okay to take care of their families to be healthy enough to go to work to finish their education to pursue their potential and their purpose and they know that having health care is fundamental to that so so they are there and now maybe what we call it is important maybe who's talking about it is critical maybe the way in which we listen and share what we've heard from these different communities is is part of it but I'm convinced that Texas is already there and so we're talking about the things that are important to Texans but medicare-for-all in Texas now I agree with you but I think some people in El Paso might say you have cojones hate to run and that was a number one issue you mentioned when I asked right right in this answer so you're sure that's gonna work in Texas I mean because I hear from the national Democrats oh my god don't do Medicare for all that's just fight Trump and resist but don't go forward and especially in Texas they say no no no just two Republican Lite why Medicare for all why do you think that's gonna win yeah so I feel like I owe those whom I want to represent my honesty and and they need to know our vision for getting to what so many of them have described as the goal which is that everyone should be able to see a doctor when they need to should be able to be healthy should be able to get healthy and the only way and I'm not a you know expert on this by any means but the only way that I understand that you can get there is to have some kind of a single-payer model and the best one going right now in the United States of America is Medicare it's got a 2% overhead administrative cost it has excellent customer satisfaction it can always be improved and I'm sure there's a way that we can do that and I think by extending the universe of people who can enroll in Medicare maybe initially having it as a public option on the exchanges allow Medicare to compete with private insurers drive down cost for all concerned improve outcomes and quality of care and then maybe ultimately through stages get to universal and a single-payer system that's the only way I know how to get there so it's one thing you know sometimes Democrats are maybe Republicans as well will say well we just need to find a way to work together listen to the stakeholders and the policy experts and drive down the cost of health care and improve access and affordability that's great how are you gonna do it and there are some very specific proposals on the table today and I think they warrant a discussion and a debate and I know through that process they will be perfected and certainly we should listen to Republicans and independents and those experts who can help us to make those better proposals but every single wealthy democracy in the world today and many of the poor ones have some form of universal health care and their total costs their outcomes the health of their citizens far exceed what we're seeing here in the United States and I think there's something to be learned from that there's something uniquely American that we can bring to that and and deliver something far better for our constituents and so and and and it's connected to every other thing that we care about to education to work to our quality of life
