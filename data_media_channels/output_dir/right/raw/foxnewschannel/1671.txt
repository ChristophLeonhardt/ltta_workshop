THIS WAS ALSO IN

00:00:23,474 --> 00:00:26,010
"THE NEW YORK TIMES" PIECE.

17
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,744
EVEN AS HE PLACES HIS PUBLIC

18
00:00:26,744 --> 00:00:28,946
ROMANCE WITH PRAISE FOR THE

00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:29,647
PRESIDENT, MIKE PENCE WE ARE

20
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:33,017
TALKING ABOUT, VICE PRESIDENT

21
00:00:33,017 --> 00:00:34,185
PENCE AND A SIMPLE ONE OF STAFF

22
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,388
ARE UNSETTLING A GROUP OF

23
00:00:37,388 --> 00:00:38,122
MR. TRUMP'S FIERCE LOYALIST WHO

24
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:40,258
FEAR THEY ARE FORGING A SEPARATE

25
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:40,658
POWER BASE.

26
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:44,028
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE DOING?

27
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:44,729
>> LOOK, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

28
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:46,831
WILL EVER ACCUSE ME OF BEING

29
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,398
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A

30
00:00:47,398 --> 00:00:49,200
DONALD TRUMP LOYALIST.

31
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,768
I WAS THE CAMPAIGN MANAGER, I

32
00:00:50,768 --> 00:00:52,670
WAS THERE WHEN WE TURNED THE

33
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,772
LIGHTS ON AND I'M HONORED TO BE

34
00:00:54,772 --> 00:00:55,806
JOINING THE VICE PRESIDENTS PACK

35
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:57,208
SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO RAISE

36
00:00:57,208 --> 00:01:00,511
MONEY WITH THE EXPLICIT GOAL OF

37
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:02,413
SUPPORTING CANDIDATES WHO ARE

38
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,347
SUPPORTING THE TRUMP-PENCE

39
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,183
AGENDA THROUGH HARD MONEY

40
00:01:05,183 --> 00:01:06,250
CONTRIBUTIONS AND MAKING SURE

41
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,021
THAT WE ARE RETAINING OUR

42
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:10,922
MAJORITY IN THE U.S. HOUSE.

43
00:01:10,922 --> 00:01:13,124
THAT IS THE FOCUS OF THE PENCE

44
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:15,660
PACT THAT I AM NOW PART OF AND

45
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:16,561
THAT IS COMPLETELY WITH THE

46
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:18,663
BLESSING OF THE UNITED STATES.

47
00:01:18,663 --> 00:01:20,231
>> Martha: IN TERMS OF ALL

48
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:21,165
THESE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE

49
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,267
RELEASED TODAY, THOUSANDS OF

50
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:24,735
PAGES FROM DONALD TRUMP JR.'S

51
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:24,769
TRANSCRIPT, THIS IS WHAT HE    E

00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:24,802

00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:24,835
TRANSCRIPT, THIS IS WHAT HE    I

TRANSCRIPT, THIS IS WHAT HE    D

55
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,039
ABOUT IT.

56
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,273
FOR OVER FIVE HOURS I ANSWERED

57
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:32,043
EVERY QUESTION ASKED AND WAS

58
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:33,878
CANDID AND FORTHRIGHT WITH THE

59
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:35,246
COMMITTEE.

60
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:36,681
YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHERE THIS

61
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,016
WHOLE THING IS GOING?

62
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,551
>> I THINK DON JR. IS EXACTLY

63
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:40,851
RIGHT.

64
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,987
I'VE BEEN VERY PUBLIC.

65
00:01:42,987 --> 00:01:43,988
I'VE HAD THE UNFORTUNATE

66
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,223
PRIVILEGE OF SITTING BEFORE THE

67
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:47,258
HOUSE AND THE SENATE COMMITTEES

68
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:47,858
TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY.

69
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,026
I DID IT VOLUNTARILY.

70
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:49,727
YOU SIT THERE AS LONG AS THEY

71
00:01:49,727 --> 00:01:52,396
NEED YOU TO TO MAKE SURE THAT

72
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:53,764
YOU'VE ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION

73
00:01:53,764 --> 00:01:55,333
TO PROVE ONCE AGAIN THERE WAS NO

74
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,434
COLLUSION IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR

75
00:01:56,434 --> 00:01:59,437
FORM AND THAT'S WHAT DON JR. DID

76
00:01:59,570 --> 00:01:59,870
SHOWS.

77
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,006
HE SAT FOR FIVE HOURS AND

78
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:02,707
ANSWERED EVERY QUESTION THEY

79
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:03,975
ASKED AND THEN HE FINALLY GOT UP

80
00:02:03,975 --> 00:02:05,409
AND LEFT AND NOW WE SEE THOSE

81
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,444
ANSWERS IN WRITING AND IT SHOWS

82
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,012
EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID.

83
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:09,780
THERE WAS NO COLLUSION BETWEEN

84
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,448
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE

85
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:11,649
OUTSIDE INFLUENCER.

86
00:02:11,649 --> 00:02:12,817
>> Martha: WE WILL GET INTO

87
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:13,985
THIS MORE IN A MOMENT BUT I WANT

88
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:15,820
TO ASK YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

89
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,122
SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BYR

90
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:18,155
SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BYD

91
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:18,589
SOME COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BYY

92
00:02:18,589 --> 00:02:19,624
GIULIANI WHO IS NOW REPRESENTING

93
00:02:19,624 --> 00:02:20,825
THE PRESIDENT IN THIS MATTER.

94
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:22,693
HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT THE

95
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:24,195
POSSIBILITY OF A PRESIDENTIAL

96
00:02:24,195 --> 00:02:25,062
INDICTMENT.

97
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:25,896
HE SAID THEY CAN'T INDICT, AT

98
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,932
LEAST THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TO

99
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:31,269
US AFTER SOME BATTLING, THEY

100
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,837
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TO US HE SAYS.

101
00:02:32,837 --> 00:02:34,805
>> THIS GOES BACK TO -- I

102
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:37,108
BELIEVE IT'S A 1999 CLINTON ERA

103
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:39,377
MEMO, BILL CLINTON ERA MEMO THAT

104
00:02:39,377 --> 00:02:40,845
WAS WRITTEN THAT SAID A SITTING

105
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:42,246
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

106
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,648
CANNOT BE INDICTED AND THAT WAS

107
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:45,116
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

108
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:47,084
DISCUSSED NOW FOR ALMOST 20

109
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:47,818
YEARS AND THAT HAS BEEN THE

110
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,887
RULES AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND

111
00:02:49,887 --> 00:02:50,821
THE MAYOR IS SAYING IS THE

112
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,923
MUELLER TEAM ABIDE BY THAT MEMO

113
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,026
AND UNDERSTANDS IT TO BE

114
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,027
ACCURATE AND THERE IS NO

115
00:02:56,027 --> 00:02:56,994
INDICTMENT COMING FOR THE

116
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,396
PRESIDENT BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

117
00:02:58,396 --> 00:02:59,196
COLLUSION, THERE WAS NO

118
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,064
COORDINATION.

119
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,832
THERE IS NOTHING TO INDICT HIM

120
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:02,767
FOR OTHER THAN PUTTING AMERICA

121
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:03,434
FIRST.

122
00:03:03,434 --> 00:03:05,102
IF THAT'S A CRIME HE'S GOING TO

123
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:05,636
BE INDICTED.

124
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,271
>> Martha: HAS RUDY GIULIANI

125
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,007
GIVEN YOU THAT KIND OF ASSURANCE

126
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:10,808
GIVEN YOU THAT KIND OF ASSURANC

127
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:11,175
ASSURANCE?

128
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:11,976
SORT OF OFF-LINE ON ALL OF THIS

129
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:13,844
BECAUSE WHEN HE MAKES THE

130
00:03:13,844 --> 00:03:15,212
STATEMENTS, THE REPORTS ARE THAT

131
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:16,213
HE'S GETTING AHEAD OF HIMSELF,

132
00:03:16,213 --> 00:03:16,881
THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE SAYING

133
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:19,417
THERE'S NO INDICTMENT WHEN THE

134
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,151
OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE ISSUE IS

135
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:21,018
STILL OUT THERE.

136
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:22,386
DO YOU THINK THAT HE IS SORT OF

137
00:03:22,386 --> 00:03:23,487
ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE

138
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:25,323
PRESIDENT AND THE REST OF THE

139
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:26,324
TEAM WHEN HE COMES OUT AND SAYS

140
00:03:26,324 --> 00:03:28,426
THERE WILL BE NO INDICTMENT?

141
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,961
>> I THINK THE MAYOR IS EXACTLY

142
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,629
ON THE PRESIDENT'S TEAM.

143
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,164
IT IS A DIFFERENT TACTIC, WHICH

144
00:03:33,164 --> 00:03:36,033
IS A MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE TACTIC

145
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:36,934
AS IT RELATES TO DEALING WITH

146
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:39,704
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

147
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,739
TOMORROW MARKS THE ONE-YEAR

148
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:43,607
ANNIVERSARY OF BOB MUELLER BEING

149
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:44,642
NAMED AS THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO

150
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,643
INVESTIGATE THIS AND WHAT WE'VE

151
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,411
SEEN IS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

152
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:49,413
WASTED, NO COLLUSION BY THE

153
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:49,814
PRESIDENT.

154
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,415
WE KNOW THAT NO COLLUSION BY THE

155
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:53,651
TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND THE MAYOR HAS

156
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,219
NOW SAID IF BOB MUELLER WANTS TO

157
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,420
TALK TO THE PRESIDENT YOU DO IT

158
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,422
THROUGH A SERIES OF QUESTIONS IN

159
00:03:58,422 --> 00:03:59,423
A VERY LIMITED FASHION.

160
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:00,558
THAT'S A VERY REASONABLE REQUEST

161
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:02,226
AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE

162
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:02,960
MUELLER TEAM HAS ANY INTEREST IN

163
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,795
DOING THAT.

164
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:05,463
>> Martha: LET'S PLAY THIS

165
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:06,997
SOUND BITE FROM THE INTERVIEW

166
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:07,698
THAT LAURA INGRAHAM DID WITH

167
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:08,899
RUDY GIULIANI AND GET YOUR QUICK

168
00:04:08,899 --> 00:04:09,633
THOUGHTS FROM THAT BEFORE WE

169
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,635
HEAD TO THE BREAK.

170
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:12,470
>> WHAT IS YOUR OPTIMAL TIMELINE

171
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,872
FOR THIS TO WRAP UP?

172
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:15,239
>> TODAY.

173
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:17,208
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

174
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,743
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE THE FACTS

175
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,411
FROM WHICH THEY CAN WRITE THE

176
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:20,845
REPORT.

177
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:22,947
GOING TO WRITE A FAIR REPORT,

178
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:23,247
FINE.

179
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,182
GOING TO FIND      WRITE AN UNFI

180
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,050
GOING TO FIND      WRITE AN UNFR

181
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,083
GOING TO FIND      WRITE AN UNFP

182
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:26,117
GOING TO FIND      WRITE AN UNFR

183
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:26,350
GOING TO FIND      WRITE AN UNF,

184
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,785
WRITE IT AND WE WILL COMBAT IT.

185
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:30,855
WE ARE READY TO RIP IT APART.

186
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,691
>> Martha: THE PRESIDENT'S

187
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:34,992
FORMER ATTORNEYS SAID THEY FELT

188
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:36,360
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO WRAP UP

189
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,794
VERY QUICKLY.

190
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:37,828
THEY ARE NO LONGER IN THE

191
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:38,462
PICTURE.

192
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:39,230
ONE OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT THAT

193
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,664
IS THEY ARE NOT GIVING THE

194
00:04:40,664 --> 00:04:41,632
PRESIDENT SORT OF THE FULL

195
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:43,300
PICTURE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON

196
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,068
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

197
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:45,836
DO YOU THINK THAT RUDY GIULIANI

198
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,872
IS CORRECT, THAT THIS IS

199
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,640
WRAPPING UP, SHOULD WRAP UP AND

200
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,441
WILL WRAP UP QUICKLY?

201
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,575
>> I HOPE IT WRAPS UP VERY

202
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:54,612
QUICKLY BECAUSE THE GOAL HERE OF

203
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:56,013
THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION IS TO

204
00:04:56,013 --> 00:04:58,015
WRITE A REPORT TO CONGRESS TO

205
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,784
SHOW IF THERE WAS ANY COLLUSION

206
00:04:59,784 --> 00:05:00,785
OR COOPERATION OR COORDINATION,

207
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:02,553
WHICH THERE WASN'T.

208
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:03,821
THAT REPORT IS GOING TO TAKE

209
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:04,188
SOME TIME.

210
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,825
WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IF ANY

211
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:08,559
POLITICALIZATION OF THIS ANY

212
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:08,893
FURTHER.

213
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,461
WE  WE THE MUELLER TEAM TO WRITE

214
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:12,062
THERE PURPORTS TO CONGRESS OF

215
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,431
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE VERY

216
00:05:13,431 --> 00:05:14,965
CLEARLY THAT THE FROM CAMPAIGN,

217
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:16,400
OF WHICH I WAS A PART OF FOR A

218
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,202
LONG PERIOD OF TIME, NEVER

219
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:19,203
COORDINATED WITH ANY RUSSIANS,

220
00:05:19,203 --> 00:05:20,237
THERE WEREN'T ANY RUSSIANS

221
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,939
THERE, THERE WAS NO COLLUSION

222
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:22,640
AND THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN

223
00:05:22,640 --> 00:00:00,000
PEOPLE DESERVE TO SEE SO I THINK
