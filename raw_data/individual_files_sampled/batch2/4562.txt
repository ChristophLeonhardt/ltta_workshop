let's bring in our Republican Congressman Jeff Denham of California congressman thanks so much for being with us we saw yesterday Paul Ryan and Mark meadows exchanging words and immigration you've been concerned about how the gold posts keep moving on an immigration reform bill that can put this mess behind us tell us about it yeah certainly disappointing to be in continuous negotiations week after week and every time you come back not only are the members of the freedom caucus changing but the goalpost changed as well so we would agree to a number of different issues they'd bring new issues out we'd agree to those I mean we have a very conservative bill that still addresses the things that we were pushing for 1.8 million protected dreamers from day one and strong border security but even last night you know there's a lot of traits and characteristics that I admire about the freedom caucus sticking together but honesty is just not one of them and so last night again the dust-up with the speaker on the floor was about changing once again their commitment to the overall strategy of bringing these bills to the floor and sign this discharge petition so let's get specific what are they being what's the freedom caucus being dishonest on give me an example let's say a policy that they've brought to the table to move the goal posts Oh a number of different policies but the policy issues we agreed to so that is of less concern but because there's such a trust factor going out of the meetings on the final night when they couldn't even agree whether or not they would take down the rule I mean you served in Congress you know when you start getting into these parliamentary procedures you're either working together or you're not right and so we'd agreed to bring up a rule and then a rule and then a bill and a bill so you couldn't separate or take down the other members issue well not only have they gone back on that but now you'll see a different procedures coming up today and then last night in the middle of the night they dropped in a couple of amendments to the good lab bill to make it more difficult on the House floor today so I'm curious do you think their goal is to simply kill any immigration reform bills I think certainly by some you know there are some that feel the good lap bill is amnesty so yeah there's certainly some division within the freedom caucus but that's also creating some some challenges within the Republican caucus overall let me ask you about the possibility of getting a fix to what we've been seeing over the past 20 days on the border you've said that it's just it's unsustainable and the president actually under finally understood that last night I'm curious is Congress going to be able to move forward and you're going to be able to change legislation so 20 days from now we aren't at the same position where children babies toddlers infants have to be separated from their parents it's still are yes obviously this is an ongoing problem from the previous two presidents we've always had unaccompanied minors come across we've always had these challenges with huge numbers coming over in the summer we obviously have a big economy right now where more jobs here provide better opportunity and and more of an attraction for people to come here but what we haven't seen is these kids separated from their parents that should never happen I've asked homeland security and Health and Human Services for a list of show us where these kids are because it is a different scenario while you put unaccompanied minors on planes in the past while you've shipped them across the country even under the Obama administration you've never pulled them away from parents and so that is a big challenge it's a big question we want to know where those kids are but ultimately changing this policy I think that this is our opportunity I don't think either party has been as close as we are today but I'm not afraid or ashamed of working with the other party either I think the best solution becomes an American solution where you have Republicans and Democrats working together in a bipartisan fashion we're not there yet but certainly we had a great deal of support on the discharge petition and were reserved every parliamentary option to continue to push this issue congressman Richard Haass you-you-you segue to the point I was going to raise the only way to beat a blocking minority like the freedom caucus is to make them irrelevant so why not have a serious conversation with the Democrats with moderate Democrats and put together a working majority that essentially makes this minority irrelevant yeah and I believe we were working in that direction working with our Democrat colleagues obviously as you've seen with the discharge petition two parties working together to not bring up a Democrat bill or a liberal bill but to actually have a full debate on four different pieces of legislation in front of the American public if it's a really debate about ideas why would you be afraid to take that in front of the American public and so you know we're gonna see two bills today but if those fail I think that there's gonna be greater opportunity for both parties to work together and and not allow the freedom caucus to hijack the agenda congressman it's willie Geist it's good to see you this morning as you know the president's executive order does nothing to address the more than 2300 kids who are currently sitting in detention separated from their families yesterday initially HHS says this executive order does not grandfather in those existing cases then they came out later and said we don't have any guidance on it actually so they sort of walked back that comment the big question for us this morning for a lot of people across the country is what is going to happen to those 2,300 kids well certainly this is not new policy again once this one under the Department of Justice once the kids were separated from their parents they were treated as unaccompanied minors which we've had thousands every single year again the challenge is notifying the parents that and reuniting the the parents later unaccompanied minors you know for years we've been finding ways to not only find foster homes but more importantly to unite them with relatives while they're waiting due process would you have any sense for what will happen to these specific 2,300 kids and if you don't what should happened with them well I had ice and Border Patrol in my office you today we were having a discussion about this they're able to do DNA checks within an hour so they're able to identify these kids and I would expect if HHS has accurate lists or they're able to reunite but I don't think that we should go through extreme situations like Democrats were proposing last night that we start putting ankle bracelets on these kids while they're awaiting due process I mean some of these kids are going to go to our schools to put a target on these kids back by putting an ankle bracelet on them to monitor them I think is the wrong proposal as well all right Congressman Jeff Denham thank you so much for being with
