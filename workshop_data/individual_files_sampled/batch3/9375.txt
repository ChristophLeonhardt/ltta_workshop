PROBABLY MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU. AND THEY CANCELED AFTER BARR TWEETED ABOUT FORMER OBAMA STAFFER VALERIE JARRETT. AND IN THE SAME WEEK, THERE IS MORE FALLOUT OVER TV PERSONALITIES JOY REED AND SAMANTHA BEE. BOTH HAVE ISSUED APOLOGIES FOR CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS AND RECEIVED SHOWS OF SUPPORT FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE NETWORKS. THE SEEMINGLY LACK OF PUNISHMENT HAS IRKED MANY AMERICANS, INCLUDING PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO SHOWED SUPPORT FOR ROSEANNE BARR FOLLOWING HER SHOW'S CANCELLATION. HERE TO WEIGH IN, HARRISBURG PENNSYLVANIA HOST, RJ HARRIS, 580 ON THE DIAL AS YOU DRIVE THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND FOR THE REST OF US ON THE WORLDWIDE WEB. GOOD TO BE HERE. LELAND: THERE'S A DISTINCTION YOU CAN MAKE ABOUT WHAT EACH OF THE WOMEN DID OR SAID, JOY REED WITH FORMER BLOG POST FROM TEN YEARS AND SAMANTHA BEE WHO USED C-WORD TO DESCRIBE THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER. WHATEVER IT IS. THERE ARE DISTINCTIONS, BUT IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN WHAT THEY DID AND A DIFFERENCE HOW THEY'RE TREATED BY THEIR NETWORKS? NO, THAT REALLY IS THERE'S A DOUBLE STANDARD. IN FACT, AMERICA IS A MINEFIELD OF DOUBLE STANDARDS RIGHT NOW. IN EVERY WALK OF LIFE, AND IN EVERY SECTION OF LIFE, YOU NAME IT, SEX, DRUGS, ROCK AND ROLL, POLITICS, THERE'S DOUBLE STANDARDS EVERYWHERE. YOU TAKE THE N-WORD, I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES WHERE IT'S A HORRIBLE WORD, NOBODY SHOULD USE IT, BUT IF YOU'RE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT, AND IF YOU'RE SANCTIONED BY AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT, BUT NOBODY SHOULD BE USING THE WORD. IT'S A HORRIBLE WORD, IT'S A VERY CONFUSING TIME FOR MANY. LELAND: AND CONFUSING TIME FOR SOMEONE SUCH AS YOURSELF. AS YOU POINT OUT IF SOMEONE PERSON SAYS SOMETHING, IT'S OKAY, IF YOU SAY IT AS AN OLDER WHITE MALE AS A CONSERVATIVE RADIO HOST YOU'RE GOING TO BE STRUNG UP FROM THE LIGHT POST. I KNOW THIS IS SOUNDS KIND OF HOKEY, BUT MY MOTHER BROUGHT ME UP TO PRETTY MUCH RESPECT EVERYONE. I HAVE COMMON SENSE ANNOY WHAT WILL FLY AND WON'T FLY. BEING HERE IN HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA, I'M VERY FORTUNATE BECAUSE I DO SAY AND GET AWAY WITH THINGS ON THE AIR THAT IF I WAS DOING THIS NATIONALLY, I'D JUST BE, YOU KNOW, RUN OUT OF TOWN ON A RAIL. LELAND: WELL, JOY REED IS NOT BEING RUN OUT OF TOWN BY HER NETWORK. THIS IS WHAT MSNBC SAID ABOUT HER BLOG POST. SOME THINGS WRITTEN BY JOY ON OTHER OLD BLOG ARE HATEFUL AND HURTFUL. JOY APOLOGIZED PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY AND GROWN AND EVOLVED SINCE AND WE KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. IS THERE VALUE IN THAT, RJ, FOR NETWORKS NOT TO FIRE PEOPLE AND TO ALLOW, IF SOMEONE APOLOGIZES OR RESTATES SOMETHING, TO HAVE A SECOND CRACK AT IT? WELL, I DO THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE HIRING THEM TO DO, AND ARE THEY SAYING IT PERSONALLY? AND THEY'RE OWN AREAS, LIKE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER AND ALL THAT OR ARE THEY DOING IT ON THE JOB? AND IF THEY'RE DOING IT ON THE JOB, IS THAT WHAT YOU HIRED THEM TO DO? DID YOU HIRE THEM TO BE CONTROVERSIAL? DID YOU HIRE THEM, YOU KNOW, TO GO DOWN THAT PATH? IF YOU DID, I THINK YOU OWE IT TO THEM TO SUPPORT THEM AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HIRED THEM TO DO. IS THERE A DANGER IN THE THOUGHT POLICE WORLD, IF YOU'RE OUTRAGEOUS, YOU COULD SOMEHOW BE FIRED, IS THAT HOW WE GO DOWN THE SLIPPERY SLOPE IN THE FIRST PLACE? WITHOUT QUESTION. I WORK IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE I NEVER HAVE TO LOOK OVER MY SOLDIER AND WONDER WHETHER OR NOT I SHOULD SAY THIS OR SHOULD I GET DOWN THAT PATH. MY MANAGEMENT SUPPORTS ME A TO Z. BUT THEY ALSO KNOW THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE AND THAT I'M NOT GOING TO FLOAT THE LICENSE OUT THE DOOR. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT I HAVE THAT BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU SAID I PERFORM MY JOB AND I'M AT MY BEST. LELAND: FORGIVE ME FOR ONE SECOND ON THIS. YOU SAID SOMETHING IMPORTANT, FLOAT THE LICENSE OUT THE DOOR. YOU'RE ON THE AIRWAVES, THE FCC SAYS THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU CAN SAY AND SOME YOU CAN'T. THAT'S CORRECT. LELAND: ON TWITTER IT'S THE WILD WEST AND ON CABLE THE WILD WEST AS SAMANTHA BEE PROVED AT LEAST TO AN EXTENT. IS THERE A TIME AND PLACE WHERE SAYING ONE THING IS OKAY AND ANOTHER THING SHOULDN'T BE? FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, NO. LOOK, THE WAY I HANDLE, TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND EVERYTHING I DO IS, IF I'M GOING TO DO IT OFF THE AIR, IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME AS ON THE AIR. I'M GOING TO STICK TO THE SAME RULES, BUT THAT'S THE WAY I RUN MY LIFE. NEVER, NOBODY'S EVER HAD TO TEACH ME IN CLASSES ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR ANY OF THAT. I WAS BROUGHT UP TO RESPECT EVERYBODY. AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS HOKEY, BUT I WISH WE COULD GET BACK TO MORE OF THAT. LELAND: WELL, I GUESS WE COULD SAY RJ HARRIS THE SAME, WHETHER ONLINE, ON TWITTER,@RJ HARRIS. WHETHER WE HEAR YOU ON THE RADIO
