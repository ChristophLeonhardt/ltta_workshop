welcome back tonight I'm obsessed with president Trump's report card he's a model student just ask them what grade do you give yourself so far so I give myself an A plus I would say I would honestly get myself an A+ and so would many other people just one plus seriously you should see his transcript I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done we get an A+ now I've done a good job I would give myself an A plus these good jobs I'm doing a good job I give myself an A plus okay effort they don't give me credit we've done a good job good job good job we've gotten a pluses I do a good job huh there was a tent I'm the best I'm Bruce Trump doesn't get any credit and I love to get credit I love honestly it's clear he does do his homework if you go back to the Civil War was the Republicans that really did the thing this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean and it's a big ocean some very big notions could used to not be climate change it used to be global water right that wasn't working too well because it was getting too cold all over the place we have some band Umbra's here and we're gonna get him out I told the president that he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old so there you go a pluses across the board but you know why stop at just one plus careful with that GPA though mr. president it can be quite fragile Annie hello youtubers if you're watching this it means you've checked out our channel so thank you now do me a favor subscribe by clicking on that button down there click on any of the videos to watch the latest interviews and highlights from MTV daily and MSNBC you get more meet the press' content every morning and the first read newsletter if you're tired of content that you don't know anything about where it came from you don't have to have that problem with us NBC News MSNBC MTP and the Meet the Press mind set right here for you on YouTube subscribe now
