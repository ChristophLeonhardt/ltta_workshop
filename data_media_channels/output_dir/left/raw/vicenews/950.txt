00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,990
— My name is Darren Aronofsky,

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,220
I’m the writer and director of “mother!”

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,139
I identify with every character in every film—

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,090
you know, I made a film about a ballerina
and I was the ballerina,

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,760
I made a film about the wrestler
and I was the wrestler,

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,800
I was the conquistador, I was the math whizz.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,920
You pull on things you know,
things that mean something to you,

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,800
and you try to put those feelings and emotions
into the character to bring them to life.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,040
I had an idea,

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,640
and I was thinking about the home invasion genre

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,460
as a really kind-of interesting place to start.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:43,860
Everyone can relate to having company over

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,440
that doesn’t, you know, doesn’t agree to leave.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,200
At the same time, you know,

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,380
I was having a lot of frustration
about the inaction of people

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,980
sort-of dealing with our larger home—

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,500
not just our individual home,
but this planet we’re on together.

18
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,600
And I decided to sort-of think about
the planet as a character.

19
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,980
Myself, Jennifer Lawrence, and Javier Bardem
went to a warehouse out in East Brooklyn

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,039
and we taped the house out onto the floor there

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,380
and we just started to talk and go through the script,

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,460
and the last two weeks of that three-month period,

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,980
we shot the entire film, like, with single takes,

24
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,160
without any costumes or anything,

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,219
and then cut it together and had sort-of
a two-hour long version of the movie

26
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,400
so that we could sort-of see what
was working what wasn’t working.

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,180
What I like in movies is to be rocked, you know?

28
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,219
It’s very much…

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,100
it’s for people who want to go on that extreme ride.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,940
And someone at Paramount was like,
“No, no, this isn’t a ride in the park.”

31
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,220
“It was built outside the park by that really weird guy,”

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,500
“and he’s daring you to come on it.”

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,520
“And you only really ride it if you take
your hands off the handlebar the whole time.”

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,700
Any time you blink or close your eyes,

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,500
you haven’t had the full impact of the film.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,020
The last third of the film is
something we called a fever dream,

37
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,700
and the film kind-of goes
from zero to 60 faster than a Tesla.

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,320
My mentor always said,

39
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,380
“You’ve either got to make them laugh,
cry, or scare the shit out of them.”

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,120
I mean, this is a movie, you know?

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,299
We’re competing with so many things—

42
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,460
when you make movies, it’s just like, you know,

43
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,840
people are watching TV right now, you know,

44
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,400
with their phones out or their computers,
and double-triple-screening at the same time.

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,740
I wanted to make something that was
just, you know, punk rock, in-your-face,

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,000
filling your ears, filling your head with ideas,

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,680
filling your heart with emotion.

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:00:00,000
And hopefully we drop a few jaws along the way.
