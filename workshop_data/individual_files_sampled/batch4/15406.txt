now look Kanye West is eccentric I grant you that you could call him erratic I grant you that I compare him to a lot musk but look he's interesting he's breaking the mold he's doing things he's being told not to do he can even make me call him a rebel so watch the reaction of that just watch look at this look at this I listen I don't I have no animosity for Kanye West I'm just gonna be honest I may get in a lot of trouble for it I feel actually feel bad for him what I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all of these white people mostly white people embarrassing himself and embarrassing Americans but mostly African Americans because every one of them is sitting either at home or with their phones watching this cringing I couldn't even watch it I had to turn the television off because it was so hard to watch him sitting there being used by the President of the United States so president United States exploiting him and excite I don't mean this in a disparaging way exploiting someone who needs help who needs to back away from the cameras who needs to get offstage who needs to deal with his issues and if anyone around him cares about him the family that he mentioned today or whomever his managers maybe some other people who are in the music business who know him they need to grab him and snatch him up and get kanye together because kanye needs help and this is nothing to do with being liberal or conservative this is to do with honesty and we have to stop pretending sitting here on these CNN panels or on whatever network panels and pretending like this is normal and let's have this conversation about Kanye West what he said a minstrel show we really don't know what I'm in store show is in Canada in 2018 it's this it's it's white people doing a stick a vaudeville style show in blackface that's what CNN fix of a conservative black maps or just anyone who likes Trump I guess here it gets crazy here on CNN Kanye West is what happens when Negroes don't read and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it and pervert it and he's gonna have somebody who can stand with him and take pictures look at Scott could you imagine anyone saying that about a black person and basically if you're black you have to be a Democrat or else you're crazy or a stupid n-word or just you're impossible you don't exist you're not real you're an abomination of some sort first of all limit to amount of jobs the fathers lose the jobs and they say we'll give you more money from having more kids in your home I hate this next reaction the most MSNBC shaming him for talking about his feelings about a father figure Wow okay I'm doing this for everybody who's watching us who turned their volume down you can put it back up again that but if you think you're going to get a sawed filet by play and political analysis you're not because that was an assault on our White House we're not we're not Canton analyzed some of that stuff that was said as we warned you at the top there was a little bit a profanity we there was actually more than you heard we were able to bleep some of it out but there was some of it did make it in there that was crazy that was launders I mean the things that that Kanye said with my favorite yeah how he talked about he had a lack of male role models in his life growing up not a lot of male energy in his house he was drawn to Magga was because of the male cow and he put that cap on he felt like a guy who could play catch with his his because he didn't have that opportunity which was stunning and look at this guy this next guy you probably don't know him he's so obscure born in South Africa mixed race parents he now hosts a late-night show low rated in the United States Trevor Noah is his name he came from South Africa but he seeks to lecture American blacks about their experience remember what they can or can't say as you probably know by now there was a ranting lunatic in the Oval Office today and he had to sit there quietly as kanye west did this at the White House today a presidential sit down like we've never seen before Kanye West met with President Trump in the Oval Office and he had a lot to say everyone right but the campaign her just didn't make me know that the guy they didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy that could played catch with his son it was something about when I put this hat off and make me feel like Superman the I plain one it's a hydrogen-powered they're playing and this is what our president should be flying in so their series tie them in would you build a trapdoor that if you mess up and you accidentally some happens you fall and you end up next to the Unabomber all we really have is to get over and over and over again the eternal return the hero's journey and Trump is on his hero's journey right now and he might not have expected to have a crazy mother like Kanye West I'll tell you what that was you know Trump's mouth said that was impressive but you could see he was thinking is it racist if I call the cops is there and I'm not a fan of this new Kanye West but I will say I really enjoyed seeing Kanye make Trump feel the way Trump makes us feel every single day isn't it gross though that all the white owned white dominated networks dispatch just their african-american hosts are mainly their American African American hosts to destroy Connie and West hey who's the ventriloquist's dummy now that's an excerpt from my daily show the Ezreal Vance show weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern every day I do a monologue
