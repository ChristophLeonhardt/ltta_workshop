1
00:00:00,825 --> 00:00:02,327
RECOVERY AND IT'S NOTHING MORE

2
00:00:02,327 --> 00:00:02,660
SERIOUS.

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,862
>> Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH

4
00:00:04,862 --> 00:00:05,163
MUCH.

5
00:00:05,163 --> 00:00:06,698
KRISTIN FISHER OUT THERE IN THE

6
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:08,700
POURING RAIN AT WALTER REED

7
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,067
TONIGHT.

8
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:12,837
ALSO BREAKING TONIGHT, A

9
00:00:12,837 --> 00:00:13,538
HISTORIC MOMENT, CLASHES WITH

10
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:14,405
SOME DEADLY CHAOS IN THE

11
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:15,807
MIDDLE EAST AS THE U.S.

12
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,742
OFFICIALLY OPENED THE EMBASSY

13
00:00:17,742 --> 00:00:20,378
NOW IN JERUSALEM.

14
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:22,180
>> WE WELCOME YOU OFFICIALLY AND

15
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,782
FOR THE FIRST TIME TO THE

16
00:00:24,782 --> 00:00:29,320
EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES.

17
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,188
>> THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP,

18
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:32,023
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO KEEP

19
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:33,291
YOUR PROMISES.

20
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:35,493
>> WE STAND TOGETHER BECAUSE WE

21
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,662
BELIEVE DEMOCRACY IS WORTH

22
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,129
DEFENDING.

23
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:39,297
>> THE UNITED STATES WILL ALWAYS

24
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:41,132
BE A GREAT FRIEND OF ISRAEL AND

25
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:42,533
A PARTNER IN THE CAUSE OF

26
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:45,503
FREEDOM AND PEACE.

27
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,471
>> Martha: A LOT OF POSITIVE

28
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:47,705
CELEBRATION ON THAT SIDE.

29
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:50,775
BUT AT LEAST 55 PEOPLE ARE DEAD

30
00:00:50,775 --> 00:00:52,143
AT THIS HOUR.

31
00:00:52,143 --> 00:00:53,111
IF THE INTERNATIONAL

32
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:54,479
RAMIFICATIONS ALREADY BEING

33
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:54,912
FELT.

34
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:55,713
TURKEY TONIGHT HAS ANNOUNCED

35
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:58,116
THAT THEY WILL PULL THEIR

36
00:00:58,116 --> 00:00:59,384
AMBASSADORS OUT OF ISRAEL AND

37
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:00,184
OUT OF THE UNITED STATES IN

38
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:01,486
RESPONSE TO THIS MOVE.

39
00:01:01,486 --> 00:01:03,254
THIS IS THE QUESTION, IS AT THE

40
00:01:03,254 --> 00:01:03,955
BEGINNING OF A POWER SHIFT IN

41
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:06,891
THE MIDDLE EAST THAT COULD LEAD

42
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:08,292
ULTIMATELY TO PEACE, OR DOES IT

43
00:01:08,292 --> 00:01:08,926
MARK THE END OF THE PEACE

44
00:01:08,926 --> 00:01:11,129
PROCESS IN THE BEGINNING OF MORE

45
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:12,597
VIOLENCE TO COME?

46
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:14,499
JOINING ME NOW, KELLYANNE

47
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:15,633
CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE

48
00:01:15,633 --> 00:01:16,567
PRESIDENT.

49
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,035
TONIGHT.

50
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,773
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.

51
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:23,408
EARLIER TODAY ROCHE TOP WAS

52
00:01:23,408 --> 00:01:23,708
SPEAKING WITH THE

53
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:25,076
PRESS.

54
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:27,445
HE SAID HE BELIEVES IN TERMS OF

55
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:29,914
THIS VIOLENCE THAT THE

56
00:01:29,914 --> 00:01:30,915
RESPONSIBILITY RESTS SQUARELY

57
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:31,682
WITH HAMAS.

58
00:01:31,682 --> 00:01:33,718
IS THAT THE WHITE HOUSE

59
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,252
PERSPECTIVE ON THE?

60
00:01:34,252 --> 00:01:37,221
>> WE THINK THESE DEATHS ARE

61
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,022
TRAGIC OF COURSE.

62
00:01:38,022 --> 00:01:39,090
AND A LOSS OF LIFE IS.

63
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,693
AT THE SAME TIME THEY BEAR THE

64
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:43,694
RESPONSIBILITY FOR KILLING THESE

65
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:44,295
INDIVIDUALS.

66
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:45,897
THIS PRESIDENT MADE GOOD ON THE

67
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,131
PROMISE OF FOUR PRESIDENTS, THE

68
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,534
PREVIOUS THREE PRESIDENTS BEFORE

69
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:50,902
HIM ALL PROMISED TO DO WITH THIS

70
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,904
PRESIDENT DID, WHICH IS TO

71
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,338
RECOGNIZE JERUSALEM AS THE

72
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:55,807
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AS ISRAEL IS

73
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:58,309
DUE AND TO MOVE OUR U.S. EMBASSY

74
00:01:58,309 --> 00:01:58,609
THERE.

75
00:01:58,609 --> 00:01:59,377
PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH SAID AS

76
00:01:59,377 --> 00:02:00,445
SOON AS HE GOT INTO OFFICE HE

77
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:02,513
WOULD DO THAT.

78
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:03,748
IT WAS NOT DONE.

79
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,782
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID THAT

80
00:02:04,782 --> 00:02:05,483
JERUSALEM, ISRAEL MUST REMAIN

81
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,919
UNDIVIDED AND THAT JERUSALEM

82
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,053
WILL ALWAYS BE ITS CAPITAL.

83
00:02:09,053 --> 00:02:11,122
IN THIS WAY THE PRESIDENT IS

84
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:12,290
ONLY RECOGNIZING REALITY.

85
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,891
BUT I THINK IT ALSO, THE

86
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,127
VIOLENCE IN THE LOSS OF LIFE,

87
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:16,961
MARTHA, UNDERSCORES THAT THIS IS

88
00:02:16,961 --> 00:02:21,265
A VERY FRAUGHT PROCESS AND THAT

89
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:22,467
HAMAS HAS BEEN CAUSING TROUBLE

90
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:23,901
IN GAZA FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

91
00:02:23,901 --> 00:02:25,503
>> Martha: IT RAISES THE

92
00:02:25,503 --> 00:02:26,737
OBVIOUS QUESTION, ONCE THAT MOVE

93
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:28,339
HAS BEEN MADE, AND AS YOU SAY IT

94
00:02:28,339 --> 00:02:30,641
HAS BEEN PROMISED BY SEVERAL

95
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:31,876
U.S. PRESIDENTS AND NOW CARRY

96
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:32,643
THROUGH BY PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT

97
00:02:32,643 --> 00:02:34,912
WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

98
00:02:34,912 --> 00:02:35,780
WE KNOW THAT JARED KUSHNER AND

99
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,482
OTHERS HAVE WORKED ON THE PEACE

100
00:02:37,482 --> 00:02:37,882
PROCESS.

101
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:40,718
WHERE IS THAT PEACE PROCESS NOW?

102
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:41,886
WHAT'S THE NEXT MOVE?

103
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:43,821
>> WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT

104
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:44,722
PEACE PROCESS OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR

105
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:45,923
GREATEST ALLY IN THE

106
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:46,557
MIDDLE EAST, THE STATE OF

107
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:46,958
ISRAEL.

108
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,925
AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY THAT A

109
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:50,495
NUMBER OF ALLIES ARE JOINING

110
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:52,130
WITH THIS PRESIDENT WHEN HE'S

111
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,498
TAKING SUCH BOLD ACTIONS AROUND

112
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:54,899
THE GLOBE OTHERWISE.

113
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:56,534
LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

114
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:57,335
NORTH KOREA.

115
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:58,069
YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, THE WAY

116
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:01,105
THE DEMOCRATS BY A 2-1 MARGIN

117
00:03:01,105 --> 00:03:04,909
APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE THE

118
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:05,643
PRESIDENT WANTING TO SIT DOWN

119
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,079
WITH NORTH KOREA AND HAVE THIS

120
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:08,679
SUMMIT.

121
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:09,447
WOMEN ARE MUCH MORE FAVORABLE ON

122
00:03:09,447 --> 00:03:11,482
THIS ACTION.

123
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,850
>> Martha: I DO WANT TO ASK

124
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,519
ABOUT NORTH KOREA BUT I WANT TO

125
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:15,253
STAY BACK WITH ISRAEL FOR ONE

126
00:03:15,253 --> 00:03:17,755
MOMENT BECAUSE FRANCE URGED

127
00:03:17,755 --> 00:03:18,623
ISRAEL TO USE RESTRAINT DURING

128
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:23,528
THE COURSE OF THIS PROCESS.

129
00:03:23,528 --> 00:03:24,896
WHAT IS THE UNITED STATES'

130
00:03:24,896 --> 00:03:25,563
STANCE TOWARDS ISRAEL ABOUT

131
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,231
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING AT THE

132
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:27,932
BORDER?

133
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,033
IS THE PRESIDENT ALSO URGING

134
00:03:29,033 --> 00:03:30,701
MORE RESTRAINT?

135
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,469
BECAUSE TOMORROW THERE COULD BE

136
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,338
AN ESCALATION AS THEY REMEMBER

137
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:36,073
AND RECOGNIZE THE DAY THAT

138
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:37,508
ISRAEL BECAME A STATE.

139
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,043
WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE TELLING

140
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:41,112
ISRAEL ABOUT THEIR REACTION IN

141
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:42,113
THEIR RESPONSE?

142
00:03:42,113 --> 00:03:42,847
>> THE PRESIDENT AND THE

143
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,549
UNITED STATES REMAIN VERY

144
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:45,950
INVOLVED IN THE PEACE PROCESS.

145
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,717
SECRETARY OF STATE POMPEO HAS IT

146
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:48,519
RIGHT WHEN HE SAYS ISRAEL HAS

147
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,154
THE RIGHT TO DEFEND ITSELF.

148
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:51,122
THIS PRESIDENT ALSO MADE CLEAR

149
00:03:51,122 --> 00:03:52,423
ON DECEMBER 6TH WHEN HE

150
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:53,157
ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD MOVE THE

151
00:03:53,157 --> 00:03:56,093
EMBASSY TO JERUSALEM THAT THE

152
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,695
BORDERS ARE LEFT TO THE PEOPLE

153
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,297
THERE, THAT THE U.S. IS NOT

154
00:03:59,297 --> 00:03:59,931
GETTING INVOLVED IN THAT.

155
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:03,334
BUT WE RECOGNIZE A SOVEREIGN

156
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,903
NATION SHOULD HAVE BORDERS AND

157
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:07,271
WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR

158
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:10,274
CAPITAL IS WHERE THEY SAY IT IS.

159
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:11,175
WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THE

160
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:13,244
VIOLENCE AND THE LOSS OF LIFE AS

161
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:13,844
WELL.

162
00:04:13,844 --> 00:04:14,779
>> Martha: I JUST WANT TO PLAY

163
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:18,082
A SOUND BITE FROM JOHN BRENNAN

164
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:19,183
AND THEN FROM MIKE POMPEO, THE

165
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:19,884
NEW SECRETARY OF STATE AND GET

166
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:24,121
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS.

167
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:24,855
>> KIM JONG UN, WHO I DESPISED

168
00:04:24,855 --> 00:04:26,857
BECAUSE OF THE BRUTALITY THAT HE

169
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:29,327
HAS PUT UP ON THE NORTH KOREAN

170
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:30,294
PEOPLE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY I

171
00:04:30,294 --> 00:04:32,129
THINK HE HAS BEEN MASTERFUL IN

172
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,097
HOW WE HAS MANIPULATED

173
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:34,498
PERCEPTIONS AND MANIPULATED AND

174
00:04:34,498 --> 00:04:38,102
QUITE FRANKLY DUPED MR. TRUMP.

175
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:38,769
>> I THINK FORMER DIRECTOR

176
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:40,171
BRENNAN'S REMARKS ARE SILLY ON

177
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,506
THEIR FACE.

178
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,274
WE ARE GOING TO ENTER INTO A SET

179
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:45,209
OF DISCUSSIONS WITH TWO NATIONS

180
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,711
DOING THEIR BEST TO ACHIEVE

181
00:04:46,711 --> 00:04:48,079
OUTCOMES FOR THEIR OWN PEOPLE

182
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:48,813
THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR

183
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:51,682
OBJECTIVES AND GOALS.

184
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:52,416
>> Martha: JOHN BRENNAN

185
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,484
STATEMENT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS

186
00:04:53,484 --> 00:04:55,486
DUPED INTO THIS MEETING WITH

187
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:55,886
KIM JONG UN.

188
00:04:55,886 --> 00:04:58,289
>> THAT'S A VERY IRRESPONSIBLE,

189
00:04:58,289 --> 00:04:59,657
IT'S NOT A RATIONAL STATEMENT

190
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:00,224
FOR SEVERAL REASONS.

191
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:01,692
YOU SEE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FROM

192
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:04,295
ACROSS THE AISLE AND AS IDRISS

193
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:07,198
REMARKED EARLIER, IN THE POLLS,

194
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:09,767
DEMOCRATS, WOMEN, COLLEGE

195
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,901
EDUCATED VOTERS THAT WE ARE

196
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:11,702
CONTINUALLY TOLD DON'T SUPPORT

197
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:14,372
THE PRESIDENT IS MUCH, THEY VERY

198
00:05:14,372 --> 00:05:15,506
MUCH SUPPORT TAKING THIS ACTION

199
00:05:15,506 --> 00:05:16,540
WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA.

200
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,942
IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING,

201
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,378
PEOPLE WHO ARE OLDER, 50 PLUS AT

202
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,213
55 PLUS, THEY CERTAINLY DO

203
00:05:22,213 --> 00:05:22,880
BECAUSE THEY LIVED THROUGH

204
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,715
DECADES OF WAR.

205
00:05:24,715 --> 00:05:26,317
THEY'VE GROWN UP ONLY KNOWING

206
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:26,984
WAR BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND

207
00:05:26,984 --> 00:05:27,385
SOUTH KOREA.

208
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,288
I WOULD SAY THAT MR. BRENNAN AND

209
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,089
OTHERS WHO STARTED IN THE

210
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,291
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE OURS

211
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,692
SHOULD REMEMBER THAT OLD SAYING

212
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:36,093
THAT POLITICS STOPS AT THE

213
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:36,994
WATER'S EDGE.

214
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:39,530
THESE ARE DECIDEDLY NONPARTISAN

215
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,298
ISSUES LOOKING FOR BIPARTISAN

216
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:40,631
SUPPORT.

217
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,332
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEONE

218
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:44,602
WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE PREVIOUS

219
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:45,303
ADMINISTRATION COULD AT LEAST

220
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:51,609
SEE THE PROSPECTS, THE PROSPECT

221
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:52,310
OF OPENING UP RELATIONS THERE

222
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,010
AND DENUCLEARIZING THE KOREAN

223
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,377
PENINSULA.

224
00:05:53,377 --> 00:05:56,614
NORTH KOREA HAS ALREADY COME AND

225
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:58,616
GET TO THIS PRESIDENT'S

226
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:00,151
LEADERSHIP, RELEASED THOSE THREE

227
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:00,918
AMERICANS BACK HERE AND EVEN

228
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:01,619
THEN PEOPLE COULDN'T JUST

229
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:03,254
APPLAUD IT AND SAY ISN'T THAT

230
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:03,954
WONDERFUL DAY FOR THOSE THREE

231
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:07,158
MEN TO BE FREE, THEY HAD TO MAKE

232
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:07,892
IT PARTISAN AND POLITICAL AND I

233
00:06:07,892 --> 00:06:08,592
THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE

234
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:09,860
PRESIDENT'S POLL NUMBERS ARE

235
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,696
IMPROVING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO

236
00:06:11,696 --> 00:06:15,299
TIRED OF THE REFLEXIVE INVECTIVE

237
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,100
AND THE INABILITY AND THE

238
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,869
IRRATIONALITY OF NOT BEING ABLE

239
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:22,940
TO SAY TODAY WAS A GOOD DAY FOR

240
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,108
AMERICA.

241
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,142
FINALLY ON THE PART OF

242
00:06:25,142 --> 00:06:25,876
NORTH KOREA, THIS PRESIDENT HAS

243
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,511
MADE CLEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT

244
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,713
THINGS ARE LOOKING VERY

245
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:29,080
PROMISING.

246
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,548
THE SUMMIT IS SET FOR JUNE 12TH,

247
00:06:30,548 --> 00:06:31,282
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE

248
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,884
PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL SEE WHAT

249
00:06:33,884 --> 00:06:34,218
HAPPENS.

250
00:06:34,218 --> 00:06:35,353
THAT THESE CONDITIONS NEED TO BE

251
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:35,619
MET.

252
00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:37,888
BUT SO FAR WE LIKE THE FACT THAT

253
00:06:37,888 --> 00:06:40,124
THEY ARE SUSPENDING THEIR TESTS.

254
00:06:40,124 --> 00:06:41,392
THEY ARE RELEASING AMERICANS AND

255
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:42,526
THIS PRESIDENT FEELS THAT WE ARE

256
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:44,228
AT A VERY GOOD PLACE MOVING

257
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,129
FORWARD TO JUNE 12TH.

258
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:46,197
>> Martha: I WANT TO GET YOUR

259
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,331
THOUGHT ON ONE LESS THING AND

260
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:49,033
THIS IS A CORRUPT WEEK FROM

261
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,334
TODAY ON LEAKERS.

262
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,302
HE SAID THE SO-CALLED LEAKS

263
00:06:51,302 --> 00:06:53,738
COMING OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE

264
00:06:53,738 --> 00:06:54,538
ARE A MASSIVE OVER EXAGGERATION

265
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:56,374
PUT UP A FAKE NEWS MEDIA IN

266
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,309
ORDER TO MAKE US LOOK AS BAD AS

267
00:06:58,309 --> 00:06:58,676
POSSIBLE.

268
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:00,277
WITH THAT BEING SAID, LEAKERS

269
00:07:00,277 --> 00:07:01,045
ARE TRAITORS AND COWARDS AND WE

270
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,881
WILL FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE.

271
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,682
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE

272
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:07,418
PROCESS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

273
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:08,686
WHO IS LEAKING FROM THE

274
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:09,387
COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT AND

275
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,322
WHAT'S GOING TO BE DONE?

276
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:12,923
>> I WON'T TELL YOU THE PROCESS

277
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:14,925
SO MUCH AS TO TELL YOU THAT

278
00:07:14,925 --> 00:07:16,927
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF LEAKS.

279
00:07:16,927 --> 00:07:18,929
SOME LEAKS EXIST TO HURT

280
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,197
COLLEAGUES, SOME LEAKS EXIST

281
00:07:20,197 --> 00:07:21,298
BECAUSE THEY DISAGREE WITH THE

282
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:22,099
POLICIES THAT ARE BEING PUT

283
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,235
FORTH, BUT NONE OF THEM ARE

284
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,203
HELPFUL AND I WILL TELL YOU

285
00:07:26,203 --> 00:07:27,171
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S GOING ON

286
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:28,372
IN THIS WHITE HOUSE BUT NOT AS

287
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:29,373
BADLY AS IT WAS AT THE

288
00:07:29,373 --> 00:07:32,343
BEGINNING, IT'S NOT SO MUCH

289
00:07:32,343 --> 00:07:35,346
LEAKING AS USING THE MEDIA TO

290
00:07:35,346 --> 00:07:36,547
SHIV EACH OTHER.

291
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:38,149
THAT WAS GOING ON QUITE A BIT AT

292
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:38,716
THE BEGINNING OF THE

293
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:40,284
ADMINISTRATION BUT IT'S LESS SO

294
00:07:40,284 --> 00:07:40,751
NOW.

295
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,852
I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS ON

296
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:44,121
SOLID GROUND HERE, THAT IF YOU

297
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:44,922
WORK AT THE PLEASURE OF THE

298
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:45,890
PRESIDENT LIKE WE ALL DO HERE

299
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:46,590
AND YOU HAVE THE PRIVILEGE AND

300
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,193
THE BLESSING OF COMING EVERY DAY

301
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:51,395
TO WORK IN THIS WHITE HOUSE ON

302
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:53,297
BEHALF OF THE NATION THAT WE ALL

303
00:07:53,297 --> 00:07:54,298
LOVE THEN YOU WANT TO BE

304
00:07:54,298 --> 00:07:56,734
COMPETENT, YOU WANT TO BE LOYAL

305
00:07:56,734 --> 00:07:58,769
AND YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO

306
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,205
REINFORCE THE AGENDA THAT

307
00:08:01,205 --> 00:08:03,908
PREVAILED HERE.

308
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:05,976
I CAN'T GO ON MORE BUT I HAVE

309
00:08:05,976 --> 00:08:07,178
SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

310
00:08:07,178 --> 00:08:08,612
PRESIDENT ON THIS VERY TOPIC

311
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:08,913
TODAY.

312
00:08:08,913 --> 00:08:10,347
>> Martha: DO YOU EXPECT

313
00:08:10,347 --> 00:00:00,000
PERSONNEL CHANGES AS A RESULT?
