1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,648
DERSHOWITZ'S BOOK WE HAVE THE

2
00:00:04,648 --> 00:00:05,382
PROFESSOR WITH US RIGHT NOW, THE

3
00:00:05,382 --> 00:00:06,116
CASE AGAINST IMPEACHING DONALD

4
00:00:06,116 --> 00:00:06,416
TRUMP.

5
00:00:06,416 --> 00:00:10,487
GOOD MORNING.

6
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:11,021
YESTERDAY WAS CRAZY.

7
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:13,556
SATELLITE ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY

8
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,324
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD EITHER

9
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:16,726
RESIGNED, ABOUT TO RESIGN OR WAS

10
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:24,734
ABOUT TO BE CANNED.

11
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:25,435
CHAOS IN THE WEST WING, THEY

12
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:26,136
WERE TRYING TO GET THE STORY

13
00:00:26,136 --> 00:00:26,503
TOGETHER.

14
00:00:26,503 --> 00:00:28,738
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO

15
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:32,709
HAPPEN THURSDAY WHEN THEY HAVE A

16
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:33,176
HEART-TO-HEART?

17
00:00:33,176 --> 00:00:36,713
>> HE IS NOT GOING TO BE THE

18
00:00:36,713 --> 00:00:37,414
DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AFTER

19
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:44,521
THE ELECTION.

20
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:45,255
THE QUESTION IS TIMING, WHETHER

21
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:45,956
OR NOT THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO

22
00:00:45,956 --> 00:00:46,623
FIRE HIM, WHETHER HE WOULD

23
00:00:46,623 --> 00:00:47,290
PREFER TO HAVE HIM RESIGN,

24
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:47,991
WHETHER HE WANTS HIM TO BE AN

25
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:48,725
ELECTION ISSUE, WHAT HAPPENS IN

26
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:49,359
TERMS OF SUCCESSION, WHO

27
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:53,797
REPLACES HIM, WHAT IMPACT IT HAS

28
00:00:53,797 --> 00:00:54,498
ON MUELLER, BUT IF YOU ASK ME

29
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:55,165
WHO IS THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY

30
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:56,733
GENERAL THE UNITED STATES

31
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:57,467
STARTING IN JANUARY OF NEXT YEAR

32
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:06,510
IT WILL NOT BE ROD ROSENSTEIN.

33
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,244
BRIAN: DOES IT MATTER IF HE QUIT

34
00:01:07,244 --> 00:01:07,744
OR IF HE IS FIRED?

35
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:08,345
>> SURE.

36
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:09,079
IT BECOMES LESS OF A POLITICAL

37
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:09,813
ISSUE IF HE RESIGNED BUT EVEN IF

38
00:01:09,813 --> 00:01:12,716
HE RESIGNS THE DEMOCRATS WILL

39
00:01:12,716 --> 00:01:13,417
TURN IT INTO HE RESIGNS AS A

40
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:20,724
PROTEST AND IS FORCED OUT.

41
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:21,391
BRIAN: THE PRESIDENT COULD

42
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,125
IMMEDIATELY PUT SOMEBODY IN AS

43
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:22,860
OPPOSED TO CONFIRMING SOMEBODY.

44
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,428
>> KNOW.

45
00:01:24,428 --> 00:01:25,162
THE PRESIDENT COULD APPOINT AN

46
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:29,600
INTERN AND HAS TO CONFIRM.

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,300
THE DAY HE MENTIONED THE 25TH

48
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,740
AMENDMENT HE WAS OUT.

49
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,277
THIS SHOWS INCREDIBLE IGNORANCE

50
00:01:40,277 --> 00:01:40,944
OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AS A

51
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:41,578
HARVARD STUDENT, I CAN'T

52
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,616
ATTRIBUTE THAT TO HIM OR A BIAS.

53
00:01:45,616 --> 00:01:46,350
THE 25TH AMENDMENT WAS INTENDED

54
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,084
FOR PRESIDENT WHO WAS SHOT, HAD

55
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:48,719
A STROKE, IS INCAPACITATED.

56
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,455
NOT A PRESIDENT YOU DISAGREE

57
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:52,723
WITH OR THINK IS CREATING HAVOC

58
00:01:52,723 --> 00:02:04,868
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

59
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:05,603
YOU DON'T USE THE 25TH AMENDMENT

60
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:06,203
PROMISCUOUSLY AND EVEN

61
00:02:06,203 --> 00:02:06,937
MENTIONING THE 25TH AMENDMENT,

62
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:07,671
THE NEW YORK TIMES STAND BY ITS

63
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:08,305
STORY, NO JOKE, A SERIOUS

64
00:02:08,305 --> 00:02:08,739
DISCUSSION.

65
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,710
THAT IS DISQUALIFYING.

66
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,444
AINSLEY: THE 25TH AMENDMENT HAS

67
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:16,714
BEEN TALKED ABOUT FOR WEEKS, IT

68
00:02:16,714 --> 00:02:17,448
HAS BEEN IN HEADLINES BEFORE THE

69
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:22,119
NEW YORK TIMES STORY ABOUT

70
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:22,853
ROSENSTEIN, THE ANONYMOUS OP-ED,

71
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:24,722
YESTERDAY AT THE UN, AMBASSADOR

72
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:25,689
NIKKI HALEY AND SECRETARY OF

73
00:02:25,689 --> 00:02:28,759
STATE MIKE POMPEO WERE ASKED

74
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:29,493
ABOUT THIS, IT IS NOT SOMETHING

75
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:31,695
EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT.

76
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:32,429
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY CABINET

77
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:33,097
MEMBERS TALKING ABOUT THAT.

78
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:33,797
IT IS COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY

79
00:02:33,797 --> 00:02:36,734
ABSURD.

80
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:40,738
>> NO DISCUSSION WITH ME ABOUT

81
00:02:40,738 --> 00:02:41,372
THE 25TH AMENDMENT IN THE

82
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:43,707
REPORT, THERE ARE TWO SENIOR

83
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:44,408
LEADERS WHO SAID THE QUESTION

84
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:46,343
WAS LUDICROUS.

85
00:02:46,343 --> 00:02:53,384
>> I HAVE BEEN AT THE CENTER OF

86
00:02:53,384 --> 00:02:54,118
THIS ADMINISTRATION WITH OTHER

87
00:02:54,118 --> 00:02:56,720
FOLKS FROM VIRTUALLY DAY ONE.

88
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,455
I NEVER HEARD ANYONE TALK ABOUT

89
00:02:57,455 --> 00:02:58,189
IT, WHISPER ABOUT IT, JOKE ABOUT

90
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:00,724
IT IN ANY WAY.

91
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:01,325
AINSLEY: DID YOU BUY IT?

92
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:07,164
>> THE 25TH AMENDMENT WOULD

93
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:07,898
CONSTITUTE AN UNLAWFUL COUP FOR

94
00:03:07,898 --> 00:03:08,732
THE FIRST TIME IN AMERICAN

95
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:09,066
HISTORY.

96
00:03:09,066 --> 00:03:09,767
IT WOULD BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

97
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:17,408
IT WOULD BE ILLEGAL.

98
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:18,109
AND NOBODY SHOULD BE TALKING

99
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:18,476
ABOUT IT.

100
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:19,110
IF THIS PRESIDENT REMAINS

101
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,810
HEALTHY AND CAPABLE OF MAKING

102
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,545
DECISIONS, NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE

103
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:21,245
DISAGREE WITH THEM, THE 25TH

104
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:28,786
AMENDMENT IS OFF THE TABLE.

105
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:29,520
PETE: WE WILL KNOW ON THURSDAY

106
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,222
NIGHT OF ROD KEEPS HIS JOB.

107
00:03:31,222 --> 00:03:32,723
THURSDAY NIGHT WE WILL ALSO KNOW

108
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:36,727
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF BRETT

109
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,863
KAVANAUGH BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.

110
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:39,463
LAST NIGHT WITH MARTHA

111
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:40,731
MACCALLUM, DENYING THE

112
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:44,735
ACCUSATIONS.

113
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:45,369
>> I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY

114
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:47,572
ASSAULTED ANYONE, NOT IN HIGH

115
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:52,710
SCHOOL, NOT EVER.

116
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,444
I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED WOMEN WITH

117
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:56,247
DIGNITY AND RESPECT.

118
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:56,981
I'M LOOKING FOR A FAIR PROCESS.

119
00:03:56,981 --> 00:04:01,119
A PROCESS WHERE I CAN DEFEND MY

120
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:04,389
INTEGRITY AND CLEAR MY NAME.

121
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:04,989
ROB: ARE YOU GETTING IT?

122
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:05,456
>> I DON'T KNOW.

123
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:08,726
IT DEPENDS ON HOW TOUGH THE

124
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:11,596
LAWYER IS IN HIS

125
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:12,330
CROSS-EXAMINATION OF THE ACCUSER

126
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,031
AND HE MUST BE OR SHE MUST BE

127
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:20,738
TOUGH.

128
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:21,473
SHE CAN'T JUST BE ALLOWED TO SAY

129
00:04:21,473 --> 00:04:24,476
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND DIDN'T

130
00:04:24,476 --> 00:04:25,210
REMEMBER IT AND IT TOOK ME SIX

131
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:25,910
DAYS TO RECONSTRUCT MY MEMORY.

132
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,747
A GOOD CROSS-EXAMINING LAWYER

133
00:04:28,747 --> 00:04:32,717
HAS TO BE GENDER FREE, RAISE THE

134
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:36,654
SAME KIND OF TOUGH QUESTIONS

135
00:04:36,654 --> 00:04:37,388
ABOUT REPRESSED MEMORY AND HOW

136
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:38,022
TO RECONSTRUCT MEMORY AND

137
00:04:38,022 --> 00:04:38,723
EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS TOLD, BY

138
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:40,725
WHOM SHE WAS TOLD, WHO MADE

139
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:47,399
SUGGESTIONS TO HER, HOW DID HER

140
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,099
MEMORY IMPROVE OVER TIME, WE

141
00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:48,833
KNOW BIOLOGICALLY MEMORIES DON'T

142
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,334
IMPROVE OVER TIME.

143
00:04:49,334 --> 00:04:49,901
THEY RECEDE OVER TIME.

144
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:52,737
HOW DID HER MEMORY GET SO MUCH

145
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:53,471
BETTER OVER SIX DAYS EVERYTHING

146
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:53,939
WITH HER LAWYER?

147
00:04:53,939 --> 00:04:54,539
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF

148
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:55,540
APPROPRIATE CROSS-EXAMINATION

149
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,208
AND ANY WOMAN OR MAN WHO IS

150
00:04:56,208 --> 00:05:00,145
AFRAID TO BE TOUGH IN

151
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:00,745
CROSS-EXAMINING HER OR

152
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:01,480
CROSS-EXAMINING HIM SHOULD NOT

153
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,452
ACT.

154
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:08,186
PETE: A FEW THAT MEN WILL LOOK

155
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:08,920
LIKE BULLIES IN THIS ME TOO ERA.

156
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,654
>> THE WOMAN HAS TO BE JUST AS

157
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:12,724
TOUGH ON BOTH OF THEM.

158
00:05:12,724 --> 00:05:16,728
PETE: DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING THE

159
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:17,429
FBI TO LOOK INTO THAT AND THE

160
00:05:17,429 --> 00:05:24,736
HIGH SCHOOL STORY.

161
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:25,237
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

162
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:25,871
>> WHEN YOU ARE UP FOR A

163
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:29,741
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT THE FBI

164
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:30,476
SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY UPDATING

165
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:32,344
ITS INVESTIGATION, THE MINUTE AN

166
00:05:32,344 --> 00:05:33,045
ALLEGATION COMES OUT THE FBI

167
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:33,645
SHOULD BE ON TOP OF IT.

168
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:34,379
DOESN'T NEED TO START SOMETHING

169
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:40,719
A NEW.

170
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:41,453
I HAVE 500 STUDENTS TO APPOINTED

171
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:42,187
POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY, I HAVE

172
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,021
BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI OVER

173
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:44,723
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, NO

174
00:05:44,723 --> 00:05:48,727
MATTER HOW TRIVIAL THE ISSUE IS,

175
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:52,197
THEY WILL ASK ME ABOUT IT.

176
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:52,931
IT CAN ONLY BE DONE IN A BRIEF

177
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:53,398
PERIOD OF TIME.

178
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:54,099
IT CAN BE DONE WITHIN 3 OR 4

179
00:05:54,099 --> 00:06:00,739
DAYS.

180
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:04,743
PETE: YOU SAID AVENATTI IS

181
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:05,377
HURTING YOUR PROFESSION,

182
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:07,780
DEMOCRATS, YOU ARE NOT HELPING.

183
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,280
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

184
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,014
I DON'T THINK HE HELPS HIMSELF.

185
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:09,748
HE MAY HELP HIMSELF IN THE SENSE

186
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:12,718
OF GETTING MORE CLIENTS BUT HE

187
00:06:12,718 --> 00:06:16,722
HAS ACTED LESS THAN RESPONSIBLY.

188
