1
00:00:00,846 --> 00:00:02,981
I'M ACTUALLY FROM SOUTH

2
00:00:02,981 --> 00:00:03,315
JERSEY.

3
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:13,425
SOMEWHAT

4
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,960
UNTIL BORDER.

5
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,293
MATTERS.

6
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:56,294
BRIBE IS VERY IMPORTANT.

7
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:57,896
AND IT NEEDS TO BE

8
00:01:57,896 --> 00:01:59,231
REITERATED OVER AND OVER

9
00:01:59,231 --> 00:01:59,531
AGAIN.

10
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:00,932
LOOK AT ME.

11
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:01,233
OKAY.

12
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,834
I HAVE GOT BROWN SKIN.

13
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,135
MY PARENTS CAME HERE

14
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:04,469
LEGALLY.

15
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,472
AND THERE ARE SO MANY

16
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:08,707
GENERATIONS OF DESCENDENTS

17
00:02:08,707 --> 00:02:10,241
OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO THIS

18
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:12,043
COUNTRY WHO ARE THE MOST

19
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:13,111
VOCAL PROPONENTS FOR MAKING

20
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:14,346
SURE THAT OUR BORDERS MATTER

21
00:02:14,346 --> 00:02:16,014
AND THAT WE HAVE AN ORDERLY

22
00:02:16,014 --> 00:02:18,083
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT

23
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:18,650
DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN

24
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,085
HERMINE WHO WANT TO DO HERE

25
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,319
GOOD AND WHO RESPECT THE

26
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,554
SOVEREIGNTY OF OUR COUNTRY

27
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:24,422
AND PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE TO

28
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:26,157
DO WORSE.

29
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:27,325
AINSLEY: OCTOBER TO DECEMBER

30
00:02:27,325 --> 00:02:29,594
NEARLY 80% OF ASYLUM SEEKERS

31
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:30,495
PASSED THE INITIAL

32
00:02:30,495 --> 00:02:31,096
SCREENING.

33
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:32,931
I'M BEING TOLD THAT FEW OF

34
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,799
THEM WILL LIKELY WIN ASYLUM.

35
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,936
HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHETHER

36
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:39,204
THEY GO BACK HOME AND WE

37
00:02:39,204 --> 00:02:40,305
HAVE TO CATCH AND RELEASE

38
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:41,473
THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY UNTIL

39
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:42,607
THEY COME INTO COURT?

40
00:02:42,607 --> 00:02:43,742
DO YOU THINK THAT NEEDS TO

41
00:02:43,742 --> 00:02:44,075
CHANGE?

42
00:02:44,075 --> 00:02:44,976
>> HERE'S THE THING.

43
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:48,246
HERE IS WHY ASYLUM SYSTEM

44
00:02:48,246 --> 00:02:49,481
HAS BEEN TURNED INTO A

45
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,483
COMPLETE JOKE.

46
00:02:51,483 --> 00:02:52,450
MEXICO ALREADY OFFERED

47
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,551
ASYLUM TO EACH AND EVERY ONE

48
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:55,186
OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE

49
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:55,587
CARAVAN.

50
00:02:55,587 --> 00:02:56,054
OKAY.

51
00:02:56,054 --> 00:02:58,023
AND IF YOU ALREADY HAVE SAFE

52
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,624
PASSAGE IN THAT INITIAL

53
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:03,295
COUNTRY, THEN THAT ALREADY

54
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:04,129
DELEGITIMIZES THE CLAIM ONCE

55
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:04,963
YOU ALREADY GET HERE.

56
00:03:04,963 --> 00:03:06,998
AND WE NEED A BETTER VETTING

57
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:09,067
SYSTEM FOR WHO ACTUALLY IS

58
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,468
EXPERIENCING TRUE

59
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:10,869
PERSECUTION.

60
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:12,070
OF COURSE WE WANT TO MAKE

61
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,806
SURE THAT WE CONSIDER THE

62
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:17,142
LEGITIMATE ASYLUM AND

63
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:18,376
REFUGEE CLAIMS OF PEOPLE WHO

64
00:03:18,376 --> 00:03:20,645
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

65
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,213
BUT, YOU SAID IT.

66
00:03:22,213 --> 00:03:23,715
STEVE, PERFECTLY.

67
00:03:23,715 --> 00:03:24,582
WE HAVE LIMITS.

68
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,417
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT'S

69
00:03:25,417 --> 00:03:27,452
BEEN MISSING FROM THE

70
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:28,486
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM DEBATE.

71
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:32,157
WHICH IS WE CAN'T TAKE EVERY

72
00:03:32,157 --> 00:03:33,224
LAST WILLING WORKER IN THE

73
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:34,526
WORLD WHO WANTS TO WORK HERE

74
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:35,393
FOR A DOLLAR AN HOUR.

75
00:03:35,393 --> 00:03:38,129
WE HAVE TO HAVE LIMITS.

76
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:38,763
BRIAN: THERE NEEDS TO BE

77
00:03:38,763 --> 00:03:39,831
MODERNIZATION OF OUR LEGAL

78
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:40,532
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM.

79
00:03:40,532 --> 00:03:41,800
IT TAKES TOO LONG.

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,101
TOO UNWE WOULDY AND PEOPLE

81
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:45,503
WHO CAN GET IN HERE.

82
00:03:45,503 --> 00:03:47,005
PEOPLE HOBBY ON THIS LINE

83
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:48,039
10, 15 YEARS AND THEY HAVE

84
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:48,940
DONE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

85
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,477
>> EXACTLY, BRIAN.

86
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,813
ONE OF THE BIGGEST MANTRAS

87
00:03:54,813 --> 00:03:55,847
THAT YOU ALWAYS HERE IS

88
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,849
WELL, WE NEED A PATH TO

89
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,249
CITIZENSHIP.

90
00:03:58,249 --> 00:03:59,684
THERE ARE MANY PATHS.

91
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:01,886
THERE IS AN ALPHABET SOUP OF

92
00:04:01,886 --> 00:04:03,221
VISAS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

93
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:03,555
PEOPLE.

94
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,590
AND THE KEY THAT YOU JUST

95
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,624
TALKED ABOUT, BRIAN, IS THAT

96
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:08,493
WE NEED TO GET THAT LEGAL

97
00:04:08,493 --> 00:04:09,427
SYSTEM IN ORDER.

98
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:11,563
IT IS -- THERE ARE HUNDREDS.

99
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:12,197
STEVE: TALK TO CONGRESS.

100
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,598
>> THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF

101
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:14,866
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

102
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:15,200
WAITING.

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,269
IT'S A HUGE BACKLOG AND THAT

104
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,137
AINSLEY: THERE IS ANOTHER

105
00:04:19,137 --> 00:04:20,005
TOPIC WE WANT TO TALK TO

106
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:21,673
YOU, ABOUT AS A WOMAN, WHITE

107
00:04:21,673 --> 00:04:22,974
HOUSE CORPTS DINNER.

108
00:04:22,974 --> 00:04:24,642
MICHELLE WOLF, COMEDIAN

109
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:25,944
MAKING FUN OF SARAH HUCKABEE

110
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:26,544
SANDERS LOOKS.

111
00:04:26,544 --> 00:04:27,879
SHE IS SAYING SHE DIDN'T DO

112
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:28,313
THAT.

113
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:31,282
BUT SHE COMPARED HER TO AUNT

114
00:04:31,282 --> 00:04:32,817
LYDIA, HAND MAID'S TALE.

115
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:33,752
I GOOGLED HER.

116
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,186
NOT EXACTLY A COMPLIMENT.

117
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:35,720
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

118
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,689
>> I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING THE

119
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:39,858
MISOGYNY OF THE LEFT FOR 25

120
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,193
YEARS AND IT IS FINALLY

121
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:43,495
ERUPTED FOR PEOPLE THAT --

122
00:04:43,495 --> 00:04:44,429
THEY CAN SEE IT.

123
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:46,231
IT IS SO TRANSPARENT.

124
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:47,432
DRIPPING FROM PEOPLE IN

125
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:47,799
HOLLYWOOD.

126
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:48,967
AND JOURNALISTS AND I HAVE

127
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,602
TO SAY IT'S A COMPLETE

128
00:04:50,602 --> 00:04:51,803
DISGRACE THAT THERE WASN'T A

129
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:54,105
SINGLE PERSON ON THE DAY AS.

130
00:04:54,105 --> 00:04:55,740
THAT INTERRUPTED THAT WOMAN

131
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,443
AS FILTH WAS COMING OUT OF

132
00:04:58,443 --> 00:04:59,044
HER MOUTH.

133
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:00,745
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW PROUD

134
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:01,479
I WAS TO BE A CONSERVATIVE

135
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:04,682
WOMAN TO SEE THE DIGNITY

136
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:06,217
WITH WHICH SARAH SANDERS

137
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:08,086
BORE THOSE SLINGS AND

138
00:05:08,086 --> 00:05:08,420
ARROWS.

139
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,054
I HAVE FACED IT.

140
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:10,688
SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE FACED.

141
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:13,191
IT'S TIME FOR THE LEFT TO

142
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:14,692
RECKON WITH IT.

143
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:15,326
AINSLEY: I WATCHED SARAH

144
00:05:15,326 --> 00:05:15,827
HUCKABEE SANDERS.

145
00:05:15,827 --> 00:05:16,761
AS A WOMAN I WOULD BE HAVING

146
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:18,530
TO FIGHT BACK AS A MAN OR A

147
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,397
WOMAN.

148
00:05:19,397 --> 00:05:20,632
WHEN SOMEONE IS ATTACKING

149
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:21,366
YOUR APPEARANCE AND DOING

150
00:05:21,366 --> 00:05:22,567
THE BEST YOU CAN AS A

151
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:23,068
WORKING MOTHER.

152
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:24,369
I'M SURPRISED SHE DIDN'T GET

153
00:05:24,369 --> 00:05:24,669
UP.

154
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:25,970
I'M SURPRISED SHE DIDN'T

155
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,237
CRY.

156
00:05:26,237 --> 00:05:26,938
I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD HAVE

157
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:28,673
BEEN ABLE TO BE THAT STRONG.

158
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,075
LET'S HEAR IT IF YOU MISSED

159
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:30,809
IT.

160
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:32,343
>> I HAVE TO SAY I'M A

161
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:33,511
LITTLE STAR STRUCK.

162
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,814
I LOVE YOU AS AUNT LYDIA IN

163
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:37,582
THE HAND MAID'S TALE.

164
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:38,950
SHE BURNS FAT AND THEN SHE

165
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,585
USES THAT ASH TO CREATE A

166
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:41,886
PERFECT SMOKY EYE.

167
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,521
[LAUGHTER]

168
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:44,923
LIKE MAYBE SHE IS BORN WITH

169
00:05:44,923 --> 00:05:46,091
IT.

170
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:48,760
MAYBE IT'S LIVE.

171
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,494
BRIAN: HER KEY LINE WAS

172
00:05:49,494 --> 00:05:51,262
AFTER ONE OF HER LINES

173
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:52,530
BOMBED AND THERE WERE MANY.

174
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,165
SHE SAID HEY, GUYS, YOU

175
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,333
SHOULD HAVE DONE YOUR

176
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,901
RESEARCH BEFORE BOOKING ME.

177
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:57,402
SHE DOES THIS.

178
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:58,169
THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES.

179
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:00,238
SHE IS FROM THE DAILY SHOW

180
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:01,372
SO YOU KNOW SHE DESPISES

181
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:01,873
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

182
00:06:01,873 --> 00:06:02,941
AND YOU LOOK AT HER ACT.

183
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:04,509
THAT'S WHAT HER ACT IS.

184
00:06:04,509 --> 00:06:05,910
>> THAT IS WHY WE HAVE TO

185
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,112
TURN THIS AROUND ON THE

186
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:08,613
LEADERSHIP AT THE WHITE

187
00:06:08,613 --> 00:06:09,547
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT'S

188
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:09,948
ASSOCIATION.

189
00:06:09,948 --> 00:06:11,616
BECAUSE, ACTUALLY, MICHELLE

190
00:06:11,616 --> 00:06:12,317
WOLF IS RIGHT.

191
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,284
THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE

192
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:16,387
GETTING AND THEY WANTED IT.

193
00:06:16,387 --> 00:06:22,494
AND THIS REUSE ALL OKAY

194
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:25,230
BECAUSE IT'S COMEDY, THESE

195
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,297
LIBERAL COMEDIANS ALWAYS

196
00:06:26,297 --> 00:06:27,765
CLOAK THEMSELVES IN TO SPEW

197
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:29,767
THE WORST KIND OF HATRED AND

198
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:30,902
INTOLERANCE OF PEOPLE WHOSE

199
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:32,170
VIEWS THAT THEY DISAGREE

200
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:32,470
WITH.

201
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,404
I WANT TO GET BACK TO THIS

202
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:34,172
THING ABOUT CONSERVATIVE

203
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:35,507
WOMEN AGAIN.

204
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,208
BECAUSE, I HAVE BEEN THE

205
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,844
TARGET OF A HATE RAPE LIST

206
00:06:39,844 --> 00:06:41,146
ALONG WITH OTHER PROMINENT

207
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:42,113
CONSERVATIVE WOMEN.

208
00:06:42,113 --> 00:06:43,615
LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO

209
00:06:43,615 --> 00:06:45,950
SARAH PALIN DURING HER VICE

210
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,551
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY.

211
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,419
THEY CALLED ON GANG RAPE FOR

212
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:48,686
HER.

213
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:49,988
THEY CALLED ON

214
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:50,421
ASSASSINATION.

215
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:52,924
THEY USE THE WORST KIND OF

216
00:06:52,924 --> 00:06:54,425
VILE IMAGERY OF ANY KIND OF

217
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:55,660
CONSERVATIVE WOMAN WHO DARES

218
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,695
TO STRAY FROM THE LIBERAL

219
00:06:57,695 --> 00:06:58,329
ORTHODOX PLANTATION.

220
00:06:58,329 --> 00:06:59,330
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS GOING

221
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,198
TO INSPIRE?

222
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:02,167
A GENERATION OF INDEPENDENT

223
00:07:02,167 --> 00:07:03,935
YOUNG GIRLS TO STAND UP FOR

224
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,637
THEIR VALUES.

225
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:08,373
OF BEING PRO-LIFE, OF BEING

226
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:09,007
PRO-SECOND AMENDMENT.

227
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,141
OF BEING PRO-LIMITED

228
00:07:10,141 --> 00:07:10,542
GOVERNMENT.

229
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:11,609
BECAUSE THAT IS THE MOST

230
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:12,510
EMPOWERING THING THAT WOMEN

231
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,680
CAN DO AND BELIEVE IN.

232
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,247
STEVE: THE WHITE HOUSE

233
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:16,881

235
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,517
THAT SHOW BECAUSE EVEN

236
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:22,453
PEOPLE ON THE LEFT HAVE SAID

237
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:23,354
WAY OVER THE LINE.

238
00:07:23,354 --> 00:07:24,923
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S A JOKE?

239
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:26,324
THEY ARE SAYING NOW MAYBE WE

240
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:27,559
NEED TO CHANGE THE FORMAT.

241
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:29,060
NO, CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE AND

242
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,162
CHANGE YOUR FILTHY MOUTH.

243
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:32,096
STEVE: THERE IS A REASON THE

244
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:32,897

00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:36,834
BRIAN: THEY WERE THERE.

248
00:07:36,834 --> 00:07:38,736
I SAW A LOT OF "NEW YORK

249
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:39,704
TIMES."

00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:40,371
STEVE: OFFICIALLY THEY HAVE

251
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,106

00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,814
CRUSADING ON BEHALF BEHALF

257
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:51,115
OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS WE

258
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:52,417
WERE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO

259
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,585
CROSS THE AISLE ON LEFT,

260
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:54,752
RIGHT AND CENTER IT ACTUALLY

261
00:07:54,752 --> 00:00:00,000
