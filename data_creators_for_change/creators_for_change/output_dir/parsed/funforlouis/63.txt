just my way up to London to meet a
friend and on the way out the house and
made myself a quick smoothie
I threw some a can of cherries in there
just to add some sweetness and
immediately realized they still had the
stones in so heard the stones blending
didn't think much of it didn't want to
waste a smoothie so I just sift out the
stones drank started drinking tasted a
bit weird to be honest and smoothie with
me anyway I've been in the car and then
I've a Glee remembered hearing the
cherry stones they're quite poisonous so
she looked online and found out that a
guy almost died eating one cherry stone
and obviously I'd probably just drank
like twenty so I pulled over started
trying to make myself vomit managed to
throw up a little bit I've also just to
let you know I've got a bit of a phobia
of vomit and you had mentioned throw up
a little bit but now I'm panicking and I
don't usually do this but panicking that
I've ingested a lot of cyanide which
isn't what's what is in stereo cherry
stones so I'm driving myself to A&E -
yeah to get checked out to see if I'm
all right I'm a bit worried - Ernest
this is only like 15 minutes ago so
haven't started feeling weird yet but
could do quite quickly
I think I'm interested a lot of cyanide
accidently I was making a smoothie and
put a bunch of cherries cherries in with
the stones started feeling some weird
stomach pains about 5 minutes ago
and speak to one of the doctors you
could probably have control
that's what I'm thinking anything to
help with home everything right
what does so many wires
how come this a mini yeah just wait
laughs put your hair down
nice easy easy to fight today
he's adding just one this gun just gets
the beat well they just blood everywhere
yeah quite what's the word vascular
that's quick
now roses and Davina is a big one sir
do you think I'm overreacting or
anything yeah cuz I'm not I'm not
usually I've been contract but I was
like we every website Arena line it's
like not just one articles like I'm like
so just down the whole lot it's really
black you can drink it and sips okay how
is it that bad
I imagine I've never tasted it by I mean
just oh yes but it doesn't taste bad
it's more the texture
okay so I've had my heart monitored I've
had a blood taken that they're gonna do
blood tests with and I've drunk a whole
big bottle of charcoal which apparently
is going to absorb the toxin as an
artist or go through my system later
I thought drinking the charcoal made you
makes you vomit but apparently it
doesn't and yeah and then I'm missing a
doctor in a minute hopefully but they
said the blood tests gonna take a few
hours so I'm hoping I don't need to wait
around for those I'm just feeling better
that I've got the charcoal absorbing
toxins in my system I was kind of
panicking before that ya know feeling a
bit better
standby blood pressure taken
to check your temperature
your blood pressure's fine like you said
I'll stop following your hands if I said
yeah that's very much good discoloration
the nails that's good show me your
tongue okay listen here sure this this
one of course any ill effects but all
wood is will just keep you in tonight
what kind of side effects would there be
no see yes you know synchronize I'm sure
that's breath agitation or sometimes
they can the first thing they notice is
really the breathing it gets quite
labored as a breathing agitation and
sometimes you can get quite significant
palpitations where they'll although
that's a very less specific sorry of
there may may sing it most common thing
is agitation a shortness of breath this
is the first with the first silencing
you see and as I say I think now that
way could have five hours down the line
I think the chances of that being though
we keep you tonight and and we'll see
tomorrow morning and as I say properly
before lunch time with you you may have
all been well would be we're gaming
tonight a min to get you home I think
early go yeah
oh I'm just leaving hospital it's the
next morning from the incident about 15
hours I think since I accidentally drank
that cherry stones but just been given
the all-clear it's just a relief just
like to shout out all the doctors at
Kingston hospital and the NHS is
yeah may I go amazing treatment oh yeah
I'm heading home now very relieved and
yeah glad I'm alive
