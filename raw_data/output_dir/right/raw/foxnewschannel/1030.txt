00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,645
>> GREG PALKOT LIVE IN SEOUL.

2
00:00:01,645 --> 00:00:02,646
ONE HOUR LATER.

3
00:00:02,646 --> 00:00:02,979
THANKS.

4
00:00:02,979 --> 00:00:04,347
>>> LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THE

5
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:06,182
REGIONAL EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS

6
00:00:06,182 --> 00:00:06,516
SUMMIT.

7
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:09,786
JOINING ME HERE IN SINGAPORE,

8
00:00:09,786 --> 00:00:13,056
SEOUL BUREAU CHIEF FOR THE "WALL

9
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:13,823
STREET JOURNAL" AND WHITE HOUSE

10
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:15,625
CORRESPONDENT FOR THE DAILY

11
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:15,926
MAIL.

12
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:18,562
I WANT TO TALK FIRST ABOUT WHAT

13
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:21,531
THE EXPECTATIONS ARE WHEN THE

14
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:22,933
DEFINITION BOTH SIDES MAY LOOK

15
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:25,435
TO FOR DENUCLEARIZATION.

16
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:26,469
HEADING IN, JONATHAN, WHAT DO

17
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:27,003
YOU THINK?

18
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:29,306
>> WELL, LOOK, THIS HAS BEEN THE

19
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:31,241
TOP TOPIC FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF

20
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:31,575
MONTHS.

21
00:00:31,575 --> 00:00:34,277
WHAT'S STRIKING HERE IS THAT WE

22
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:35,245
STILL DON'T HAVE A COMPLETELY

23
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,947
SORT OF ONE TO ONE UNDERSTANDING

24
00:00:36,947 --> 00:00:39,449
OF WHAT EXACTLY IS MEANT BY

25
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:39,950
DENUCLEARIZATION.

26
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,351
NORTH KOREA TALKS ABOUT THE

27
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:43,620
COMPLETE DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

28
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,855
KOREAN PENINSULA.

29
00:00:45,855 --> 00:00:48,191
DONALD TRUMP HAS TALKED ABOUT

30
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:51,294
AND THE U.S. POSITION HAS BEEN

31
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:52,729
FOR COMPLETE VERIFIABLE

32
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,131
IRREVERSIBLE DENUCLEARIZATION.

33
00:00:55,131 --> 00:00:56,933
WE COULD TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS

34
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:57,934
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO OF

35
00:00:57,934 --> 00:00:58,368
THEM.

36
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,202
THERE ARE GAPS STILL.

37
00:00:59,202 --> 00:00:59,936
IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT

38
00:00:59,936 --> 00:01:01,871
THEY HAVE BEEN BRIDGED IN THE

39
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:02,906
MEANTIME BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD A

40
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:07,744
LOT OF SHUTTLE DI PLO MA SI TAKE

41
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:09,045
PLACE -- DIPLOMACY TAKING PLACE

42
00:01:09,045 --> 00:01:11,481
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

43
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:13,350
WE JUST DON'T KNOW AND WE MAY

44
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,853
NOT KNOW UNTIL TUESDAY.

45
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:18,588
>> IT'S AMAZING, IT IS A DIRECT

46
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:20,824
RESULT OF THE MAXIMUM PRESSURE

47
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:21,191
CAMPAIGN.

48
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,292
THE ONLY REASON NORTH KOREA IS

49
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:23,793
SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH

50
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:25,128
TRUMP IS THAT THEY BELIEVE FOR

51
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:27,163
THE FIRST TIME THAT THEY'VE GOT

52
00:01:27,163 --> 00:01:27,931
SOMEBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE THEY

53
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:32,235
DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH, AND

54
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,837
THEIR NUCLEAR MISSILE PROGRAM,

55
00:01:33,837 --> 00:01:35,972
NOT CONTAIN IT, AND I THINK HE'S

56
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:37,407
GOT NORTH KOREA AND CHINA'S

57
00:01:37,407 --> 00:01:37,774
ATTENTION.

58
00:01:37,774 --> 00:01:39,509
>> CERTAINLY KIM WANTS THE

59
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,877
PHOTOGRAPHS OF HIM SHAKING HANDS

60
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:44,414
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE

61
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:46,650
THAT'S LEGITIMATE AND EVEN MORE

62
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,151
IMPORTANT THAT MEANS HE

63
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,119
SOLIDIFIES HIS RULE AT HOME.

64
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,387
WE WILL SEE THOSE PICTURES OF

65
00:01:50,387 --> 00:01:52,022
TRUMP AND KIM FOR DECADES IN

66
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:52,422
NORTH KOREA.

67
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:53,990
SO YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP

68
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,558
GIVES UP A LOT OF LEVERAGE AS

69
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:58,528
SOON AS HE SHAKES HANDS WITH

70
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:58,862
KIM.

71
00:01:58,862 --> 00:01:59,863
>> TO GORDON'S POINT THERE AT

72
00:01:59,863 --> 00:02:01,331
THE END, AT THE BEGINNING OF

73
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:03,466
THIS SUMMIT, KIM GETS ONE OF THE

74
00:02:03,466 --> 00:02:06,936
BIG THINGS HE WANTS WHICH IS

75
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:07,370
THIS PICTURE

76
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,005
>> RIGHT, SPEAKING TO WHAT

77
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,639
LINDSAY GRAHAM ALSO SAID LATER

78
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,641
ON, IT'S PEACE OR WAR.

79
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:13,209
HE THINKS THOSE ARE THE TWO

80
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:14,711
OPTIONS POTENTIALLY COMING OUT

81
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:16,246
OF THIS, IF PRESIDENT TRUMP

82
00:02:16,246 --> 00:02:18,448
DOESN'T EVENTUALLY GET A DEAL

83
00:02:18,448 --> 00:02:22,485
WITH NORTH KOREA TO

84
00:02:22,485 --> 00:02:22,919
DENUCLEARIZE.

85
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,853
HE SAID WE COULD TALK FOR DAYS

86
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:24,788
ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF THAT.

87
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,089
THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE TO DO TO

88
00:02:26,089 --> 00:02:28,191
TALK DAYS FOR THAT.

89
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,492
YOU HAD MIKE POMPEO REFUSING TO

90
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:30,226
TELL REPORTERS AT THE WHITE

91
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:32,462
HOUSE LAST WEEK HOW CLOSER THEY

92
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:33,430
HAD GOTTEN ON THAT.

93
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,664
HE SAID THEY HAD ON THE

94
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:35,432
DEFINITION BUT WE DON'T KNOW HOW

95
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:36,032
MUCH CLOSER.

96
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:38,168
I HAVE EXPERTS TELLING ME THAT

97
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,169
NORTH KOREA DOESN'T JUST

98
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:43,373
CONSIDER DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

99
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:44,908
PENINSULA, THAT THEY COULD

100
00:02:44,908 --> 00:02:46,376
EXPECT THAT TO EXTEND TO OUR

101
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,844
MILITARY PRESENCE IN GUAM.

102
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:48,611
THAT'S A QUESTION AS TO

103
00:02:48,611 --> 00:02:49,746
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE U.S. IS

104
00:02:49,746 --> 00:02:50,847
PREPARED TO OFFER THAT.

105
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:54,784
>> I WANT TO READ SOMETHING FROM

106
00:02:54,784 --> 00:02:56,052
RICHARD HOSS AFTER THE G-7 BACK

107
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:57,287
AND FORTH AND WHAT ENDED UP

108
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:57,787
HAPPENING THERE.

109
00:02:57,787 --> 00:02:59,089
THE UNRAVELLING OF THE G-7

110
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,790
SUMMIT WORKS IN NORTH KOREA'S

111
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,826
FAVOR, HE WRITES, AS PRESIDENT

112
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:04,594
TRUMP WILL NOT WANT TO BUST UP

113
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:05,995
TWO SUMMITS IN A ROW, LEST

114
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:08,064
PEOPLE CONCLUDE HE IS THE

115
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:08,398
PROBLEM.

116
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:11,167
INCREASES INCENTIVE FOR KIM TO

117
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:13,036
UP HIS ASKS AND LIMIT HIS

118
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:13,970
COMPROMISES AND FOR TRUMP TO DO

119
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,473
THE OPPOSITE, HARDLY THE IDEAL

120
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:16,973
CONTEXT.

121
00:03:16,973 --> 00:03:18,742
JONATHAN, COULDN'T SOMEBODY LOOK

122
00:03:18,742 --> 00:03:19,843
AT THAT AND SAY COULDN'T IT BE

123
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:21,511
THE EXACT OPPOSITE, THAT HE'S

124
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:22,445
WILLING TO JUST GET UP FROM THE

125
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:23,413
TABLE AND SAY THIS ISN'T GOING

126
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:24,781
TO WORK AND WALK AWAY?

127
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,750
>> WELL, LOOK, I THINK THERE'S A

128
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,917
CASE TO BE MADE THAT KIM CAN WIN

129
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:28,985
EITHER WAY.

130
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:30,353
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY HE GETS

131
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:31,855
EVERYTHING THAT HE WANTS IF HE

132
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:33,289
MAKES A BIG ASK AND GETS IT.

133
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:34,190
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY GOOD FOR HIM.

134
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,191
YOU ARE RIGHT.

135
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,459
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT EVEN

136
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:40,563
IF THINGS DON'T GO WELL -- GO

137
00:03:40,563 --> 00:03:43,233
WELL, HE SAID LOOK I ACTED IN

138
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:49,572
GOOD FAITH I HANDED OVER THE

139
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:56,012
DETAINEES, I BLEW UP THE SITE,

140
00:03:56,012 --> 00:03:57,981
I'VE BEEN HONEST.

141
00:03:57,981 --> 00:03:59,349
>> YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THE

142
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,084
HOSTAGES COMING BACK, NORTH

143
00:04:01,084 --> 00:04:02,318
KOREA AT THE TABLE, THE PARADIGM

144
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:03,353
HAS SHIFTED, SOMETHING CHANGED

145
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:04,654
FROM ALL THE SIX PARTY TALKS

146
00:04:04,654 --> 00:04:06,055
EFFORTS BEFORE TO GET TO THIS

147
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:06,356
POINT.

148
00:04:06,356 --> 00:04:07,590
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THAT

149
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,258
WOULD BE HIM.

150
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:09,325
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S HERE NOW AND

151
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:10,160
THE NORTH KOREANS UNDERSTAND

152
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,795
THAT HE'S NOT PLAYING AROUND.

153
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:12,862
AND IT COULD GO THE OPPOSITE

154
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:13,263
WAY.

155
00:04:13,263 --> 00:04:14,597
IF HE FEELS THAT THEY ARE NOT

156
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:15,732
SERIOUS, HE SAID, WITHIN THE

157
00:04:15,732 --> 00:04:17,934
FIRST MINUTE OF SITTING DOWN, HE

158
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:19,235
WILL GET UP AND WALK AWAY.

159
00:04:19,235 --> 00:04:21,437
THAT'S ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY

160
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:22,205
POTENTIALLY FOR THE PRESIDENT TO

161
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,574
SHOW HIS STRENGTH HERE AND TO

162
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:26,176
SHOW NOT JUST TO KIM JONG-UN BUT

163
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:27,544
ALSO JUSTIN TRUDEAU THE PRIME

164
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:28,444
MINISTER OF CANADA THAT WHEN THE

165
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,013
U.S. IS PUSHED, THAT HE WILL

166
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:30,513
PUSH BACK.

167
00:04:30,513 --> 00:04:32,215
AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE HEARD

168
00:04:32,215 --> 00:04:33,049
LARRY KUDLOW THE ECONOMIC

169
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:33,950
ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT SAY

170
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,717
THIS MORNING TOO.

171
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,653
THAT THEY FEEL THAT TRUDEAU IS

172
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:37,587
TRYING TO EMBARRASS PRESIDENT

173
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:39,088
TRUMP ON THE EVE OF THIS

174
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:39,622
HISTORIC SUMMIT.

175
00:04:39,622 --> 00:04:40,657
AND THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO

176
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:41,391
LET THAT HAPPEN.

177
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:43,726
>> WE JUST HEARD FROM GREG

178
00:04:43,726 --> 00:04:44,227
PALKOT IN SEOUL.

179
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:45,195
OBVIOUSLY SEOUL IS WATCHING ALL

180
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:46,095
OF THIS VERY CLOSELY.

181
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:47,497
AT ONE POINT THEY WANTED TO BE

182
00:04:47,497 --> 00:04:48,464
AT THE TABLE.

183
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,233
BUT THAT FIRST MEETING IS JUST

184
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,136
TRANSLATORS AND THE TWO LEADERS.

185
00:04:53,136 --> 00:04:54,404
WHAT IS SEOUL LOOKING AT?

186
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:55,705
HOW CONCERNED ARE THEY ABOUT

187
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,140
WHAT COMES OUT OF THIS?

188
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,175
>> WELL, THEY ARE CONCERNED BUT

189
00:04:59,175 --> 00:05:01,344
THEY ARE ALSO VERY HOPEFUL.

190
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,445
KEEP IN MIND THE PRESIDENT OF

191
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:04,981
SOUTH KOREA HAS INVESTED A GREAT

192
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:06,883
DEAL IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS.

193
00:05:06,883 --> 00:05:09,152
HE'S BEEN THE ONE KEEPING THINGS

WITH KIM JONG-UN, OFF VOLATILE

00:05:17,727 --> 00:05:18,494
MIX HERE.
