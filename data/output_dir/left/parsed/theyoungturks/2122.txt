>> MILLENNIAL WOMEN ARE
LEAVING THE GOP IN DROVES.
LET'S GET RIGHT TO THE STATS.
THE AMOUNT OF MILLENNIAL MEN HAS
GONE FROM 52 TO 49%, THE OTHER
WAY.
>> FIRST LET ME NOTE THE BAD
NEWS, THE FACT THAT MILLENNIAL
MEN HAVE SLIPPED A LITTLE BIT IS
DISCONCERTING.
IT IS STILL A NICE SIZE
ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS.
49 TO 41 AT THIS POINT.
USED TO BE A LITTLE BIT LARGER
THAN THAT.
BUT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT IS
THE SIZE OF THE LEAD AMONG
WOMEN BECAUSE IT IS SO LARGE.
USED TO BE BACK IN 2002, 54 TO
36.
THAT IS ALMOST 20 POINTS.
BUT IF YOU CAN HOLD MEN IN ALL
AGE GROUPS YOU CAN STILL SURVIVE
AS THEY JUST DID IN 2016.
NOW THAT THESE TRENDS ARE
AMPLIFIED AND CONTINUED TO
MULTIPLY OVER TIME, THEY ARE IN
FOR A WORLD OF HURT.
NOW MILLENNIAL WOMEN ARE 70 TO
23.
>>THAT IS CRAZY.
>> YOU CAN OVERCOME THAT LEAD
AMONG 50% OF THE POPULATION.
MILLENNIAL WOMEN ARE NOT THE
MAJORITY WOMEN AT THIS
POINT BUT THEY ARE COMING.
THAT ARMY OF DEMOCRATIC WOMEN
ARE COMING IN A BIG WAY.
THAT DOESN'T MEAN DEMOCRATS
SHOULD BE COMPLACENT.
YOU HAVE TO EARN THEIR TRUST AND
CONTINUE EARNING THEIR TRUST.
THEY ARE MAINLY REBELLING
AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY BUT DEMOCRATS HAVE THE
GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO ROOT FOR.
>> THERE WAS AN OP-ED RECENTLY
THAT POINTED OUT ANOTHER LITTLE
ASPECT OF THIS TO CLOSE THE
CIRCLE WHICH WAS WOMEN WHO
IDENTIFY AS DEMOCRATS WERE
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO
SAY THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
TO ACTUALLY GO AND VOTE AND 2018
THAN THEIR PEERS WHO SAY THEY
ARE INDEPENDENT OR REPUBLICAN.
IT IS A GROWING NUMBER OF
PEOPLE, OF WOMEN WHO SAY THEY
ARE DEMOCRAT AND ARE EXTREMELY
LIKELY TO ACTUALLY PUT THAT
NEW IDEOLOGICAL AFFILIATION INTO
PRACTICE AT THE POLLS.
>>IT MAKES SENSE.
IF YOU'RE A YOUNG WOMAN WHY
WOULD YOU BE FOR A REPUBLICAN
PARTY THAT HAS POLICY POSITIONS
THAT LOOK TO DEFUND PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, THEY FIGHT AGAINST
EQUAL PAY, THEY TAKE AWAY THEIR
RIGHT TO CONTROL YOUR OWN BODY
LET ALONE OTHER ISSUES LIKE
BEING AGAINST LGBT RIGHTS WHICH
FOR MILLENNIALS SOUNDS INSANE.
THE LIST GOES ON AND ON.
EVERY YEAR THAT MILLENNIALS
BECOME VOTING AGE IS ANOTHER
YEAR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FADES
INTO THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY.
RIGHT NOW AS THEY CONTROL ALL
THE LEVELS, YOU CAN SAY YOU
GUYS THAT CAN'T BE THE CASE BUT
THE REALITY IS THEY ARE ON
THEIR LAST LEGS AND YOU WILL SEE
THEM IN ELECTIONS TO COME.
WHEN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY
MOTIVATED TO GO VOTE IT IS
NOT EVEN CLOSE.
>>SO WHY ARE MEN GOING UP IN
TERMS OF REPUBLICAN AFFILIATION.
>>LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE
POST GAME.
TYTNETWORK.COM/JOIN.
THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TREND
AND I WANT TO DISCUSS 
IT
FOR THE MEMBERS.
