1
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,660
Every new watch is like a new piece of art

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,740
It has a different story to tell

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,080
It's a very interesting thing about watches

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,160
on the one hand you have a high precision device

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,480
and the other thing is

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,640
they have to be hand finished

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,440
which is very related to arts and crafts

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,440
You have these two worlds in one watch

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,160
both the aesthetical aspect of it

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,980
and the mechanical aspect of it

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,619
Here we are at Arnold and Son

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,060
in our premises at La Chaux-de-Fonds

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,180
where we manufacture all of our watches

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,740
Arnold and Son refers to John Arnold

15
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,460
who was one of the biggest and most important

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,940
watchmaker who ever lived

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,300
he invented a lot of technical solutions

18
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,440
still in use today

19
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,580
The aim of the modern company

20
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,720
to innovate and to continue his legacy

21
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,840
but in a contemporary, new manner

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,380
The idea is really to continue the story more than to repeating it

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,460
First with the design team

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,400
we design how the watch should look like

25
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,440
The size it should have, the thickness

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,600
you have to have a kind of mechanical harmony

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,940
is it good looking or not

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,060
and when we are happy with the new complications

29
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,560
and we think the watch has something new

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,460
then we create basically the inner works which will make the aesthetic happen

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,020
The first thing you have to do is to order the right material

32
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,180
because we use a lot of different materials into mechanical movement

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,640
going from brass over steel up to titanium or gold

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,720
and you need a specific material for every different part of it

35
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,120
once you have the raw material

36
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,440
you start really making the components

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,020
We have different kinds of raw materials going to different workshops

38
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,880
for depending on the part you want to make

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,460
If you want to do watchmaking on super high level

40
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,140
you need extremely skilled and specifically trained people

41
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,220
we have more than thirty different job descriptions

42
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,680
purely different educations

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,920
and you find these educations, these training

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,180
only in this region

45
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,000
because nowhere else in the world you need such kind of know how

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,180
Working with tiny parts is a challenge because tiny parts makes very small tolerances

47
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,720
We are working in micron tolerances

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,160
so you cannot do anything without good tooling

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,880
We have in house a tool making department

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,960
which makes from the little screwdriver the watchmaker needs

51
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,600
up to a stamping tool which takes months of development

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,580
The reason why we do all our tooling in house

53
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,760
because if you're not mastering your tools, you're not mastering the part you want to produce

54
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,820
Once all the parts are cut with machinery, they go to be cleaned

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,220
They're submitted o quality control, who decides if the part is good enough

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,840
to continue to the decoration workshop

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,640
Different kind of traditional movement decorations are applied

58
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,480
from geneva stripes, satin finish. Depending on the component

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,180
Is a mechanical watch you buy today is not a leading technology anymore

60
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,740
It's really crafts and arts

61
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,500
You are not racing for technological breakthrough

62
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,640
you are more racing for making more spectacular watches

63
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,940
You build a very different relation to a mechanical watch than you do to an electronic device

64
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,620
because the day you buy it you know that the next one will come

65
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,640
and that you will swap it for getting the better one

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,480
With a mechanical watch it's really the object as a physical object

67
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,260
of all the hand work which make it special and unique

68
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,660
That's makes I think a big difference to something more on the electronic side

69
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,380
Once these parts have been decorated they are quality checked again

70
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,260
to see if the decoration hasn't affected the functional aspect of it

71
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:54,340
That's always a bit if a trick you have to decorate but not deteriorate the part

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,360
They go to be preassembled in a specific workshop before going to the watchmakers

73
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,240
set stones for instance into main plates. Put axis onto wheels

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,900
and once all these parts have been preassembled, they arrive to the watchmaker who does the final assembly

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,880
The watchmaker gets all the little parts in little boxes

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,019
starts taking the main plate which is the base on everything gets built on

77
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,340
adding the wheels which is all on axis

78
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,440
put different bridges holding all different wheels in place

79
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,360
You have to add all the winding mechanism because you want to be able to wind your watch

80
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,460
put a dial on it then you put hands

81
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,040
and one last thing which we add always at the end is the escapement

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,040
which is basically the heart of any mechanical watch, it's also

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,660
what you hear when your listening to a mechanical watch when you hear the tick tock

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,460
It's the very first time you will see and hear your watch moving

85
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,620
Starting from the simple beating, it's a long process going to a highly accurate mechanical watch

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,740
You cannot just put the parts together and expect the watch to tell perfect time

87
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,180
We are checking the watches for 600 hours on different vibration and other machines

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,020
to get really sure that everything is ok

89
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,040
can be just s little tiny dust, you don't see it when you put it together

90
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,700
but when you move the watch it can a fild of the movement

91
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,620
So this process is pretty pretty long but this is what the complexity of such a mechanical device requests

92
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,840
Once that you've seen that the accuracy of the movement is good, you put it into a watch case

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,840
which will protect the movement

94
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,980
you add the bracelet, and the buckle and you have a watch

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,820
Watches are most of the time perceived as a time capsule

96
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,180
It's really something which are still built today as it used to be for the last centuries

97
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,660
It's nice also for people to be able to buy something

98
00:06:03,660 --> 00:00:00,000
which has always existed and probably will always exist as a form of art
