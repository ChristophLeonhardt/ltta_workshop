1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,125
AND THE REFUSAL TO GIVE PEACE A

2
00:00:02,125 --> 00:00:02,458
CHANCE.

3
00:00:02,458 --> 00:00:03,827
THAT'S THE FOCUS OF TONIGHT'S

4
00:00:03,827 --> 00:00:07,964
"ANGLE."

5
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,900
REMEMBER WHEN THE LEFT WAS ALL

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,969
ABOUT LOVE, PEACE, AND

7
00:00:12,969 --> 00:00:17,707
UNDERSTANDING?

8
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:20,109
>> ♪♪ ALL WE ARE SAYING IS GIVE

9
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:24,747
PEACE A CHANCE ♪

10
00:00:24,747 --> 00:00:28,084
♪    ♪♪

11
00:00:28,084 --> 00:00:28,885
>> Laura: YOU REMEMBER THOSE

12
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:32,121
GREAT MUSICAL NUMBERS AT THOSE

13
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:35,892
NO NUKES CONCERT IN THE LATE

14
00:00:35,892 --> 00:00:38,027
'70s, EARLY '80s, JACKSON

15
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:40,296
BROWN.

16
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:42,298
THE LEFT THOUGHT WE SHOULD STOP

17
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:43,700
BEING SO BELLIGERENT TOWARDS THE

18
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,501
SOVIET UNION, WE SHOULD ENGAGE

19
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,135
WITH THE SOVIETS ALL FOR A

20
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:49,706
BETTER WORLD.

21
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,441
SOME EVEN ADMIRED THE CASTROS IN

22
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:52,275
CUBA AND THEY FORWARD WITH

23
00:00:52,275 --> 00:00:55,945
MARXIST IDEOLOGY HERE AT HOME.

24
00:00:55,945 --> 00:00:56,613
SO ONE WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT

25
00:00:56,613 --> 00:01:00,483
MANY OF THE SAME PEOPLE AND

26
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,552
THEIR IDEOLOGICAL OFFSPRING WILL

27
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:04,120
VIEW PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SUMMIT

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,155
WITH KIM JONG UN AS A MOMENT TO

29
00:01:06,155 --> 00:01:08,491
SAVOR, A REAL CHANCE TO CREATE A

30
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:10,260
MORE PEACEFUL PLANET.

31
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,962
BUT NO.

32
00:01:12,962 --> 00:01:16,299
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

33
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,634
BECAUSE THE MAN IS DOING THE

34
00:01:17,634 --> 00:01:19,903
OUTREACH IN NEGOTIATING IS

35
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:22,939
DONALD J. TRUMP.

36
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:25,174
BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER HIS

37
00:01:25,174 --> 00:01:26,175
WHIRLWIND TRIP TO SINGAPORE FOR

38
00:01:26,175 --> 00:01:28,444
THE KIM MEETING COME HIS CRITICS

39
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:30,480
AND BOTH PARTIES KEPT REVEALING

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,081
THEMSELVES.

41
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:34,684
THEIR NARRATIVES KEPT SHIFTING.

42
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:39,322
SIX MONTHS AGO, IT WAS THIS: :

43
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:43,993
>> A LACK OF STRATEGY IN MY VIEW

44
00:01:43,993 --> 00:01:47,297
HAS ASKED SLIDING TOWARD WAR BY

45
00:01:47,297 --> 00:01:48,097
NEXT SUMMER.

46
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:50,733
>> TRUMP'S COMMENTS ABOUT

47
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:52,535
NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAVE EXPERTS

48
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:53,536
WORRY HE COULD LITERALLY

49
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,238
INADVERTENTLY TRIGGER A

50
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:55,638
CATASTROPHE.

51
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:56,839
>> HAS RECKLESS BEHAVIOR COULD

52
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,742
LAUNCH THE NATION ON THE PATH

53
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:00,209
WORLD WAR III.

54
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:01,744
>> Laura: YOU ARE ALL WRONG.

55
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:02,912
EVERYONE OF YOU.

56
00:02:02,912 --> 00:02:04,047
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO

57
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:08,318
LIST YOU ALL, YOU ARE WRONG.

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,384
BUT THEY TEAR ANY OF BEING

59
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:10,019
WRONGED BY THE EXPERTS IS

60
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:12,322
NOTHING NEW.

61
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:14,691
BUT THEY WERE WRONG ABOUT THE

62
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:17,894
ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP, THE

63
00:02:17,894 --> 00:02:18,594
ECONOMY OF DONALD TRUMP, THE

64
00:02:18,594 --> 00:02:21,297
PRO-LIFE COMMITMENT OF

65
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:22,332
DONALD TRUMP, AND THE TRADE

66
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:23,066
POLICIES OF DONALD TRUMP, JUST

67
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:27,103
TO NAME A FEW.

68
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:30,039
NATURALLY, AS THEY SUMMIT BEGAN,

69
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,508
THE ERROR CAUCUS OFFERED THIS

70
00:02:32,508 --> 00:02:33,109
TRENCHANT ANALYSIS.

71
00:02:33,109 --> 00:02:35,345
>> DONALD TRUMP CAN RELATE TO

72
00:02:35,345 --> 00:02:36,112
AUTHORITARIANS.

73
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:37,013
AS A FORMER BUSINESSMAN, HE

74
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:41,651
LIKES ABSOLUTE CONTROL.

75
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:43,119
>> IS HE A WANNABE DESPERATE?

76
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,587
>> I'VE CONCEDED THAT FOR YEARS.

77
00:02:44,587 --> 00:02:53,796
>> THE MARKED WHERE -- MORE WE

78
00:02:53,796 --> 00:02:54,497
ARE TALKING ABOUT NORTH KOREA,

79
00:02:54,497 --> 00:02:55,198
THE LESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

80
00:02:55,198 --> 00:02:55,531
RUSSIA.

81
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,165
>> THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT

82
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:56,632
FOREIGN POLICY.

83
00:02:56,632 --> 00:03:01,637
IT IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP --

84
00:03:01,637 --> 00:03:03,039
>> Laura: THAT'S ALL THEY'VE

85
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:04,440
GOT, SAYS THE WOMAN WHO BROUGHT

86
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,175
US THE WINNING CAMPAIGN OF

87
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:08,444
JOHN McCAIN IN 2008?

88
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:09,345
OH, OKAY.

89
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:11,147
RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT,

90
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:14,550
THRIVING ECONOMY, TAX CUTS,

91
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,184
DESTRUCTION OF ISIS AND A

92
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:17,787
FOREIGN POLICY COUP IS ALL

93
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:21,224
THEY'VE GOT.

94
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:23,126
EVEN AFTER TRUMP BROUGHT KIM TO

95
00:03:23,126 --> 00:03:26,129
SINGAPORE, EVEN AFTER HE

96
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,163
SQUEEZED CONCESSIONS AND AT

97
00:03:27,163 --> 00:03:27,997
LEAST A COMMITMENT TO

98
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:30,066
DENUCLEARIZE THE KOREAN

99
00:03:30,066 --> 00:03:31,501
PENINSULA, THE LEFT STILL WILL

100
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:35,905
NOT GIVE HIM A SHRED OF CREDIT.

101
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:40,109
>> DONALD TRUMP, THE REAL ESTATE

102
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:41,310
DEVELOPER.

103
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,879
AND HE DOESN'T REALIZE THAT THIS

104
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,717
DICTATOR DOESN'T WANT BEACH

105
00:03:47,717 --> 00:03:48,518
CONDOS.

106
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:49,185
HE WANTS NUCLEAR WEAPONS.

107
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:51,354
>> EMPTY WORDS FROM A

108
00:03:51,354 --> 00:03:55,525
POTENTIALLY WORDS.

109
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:57,126
FLAGS AND CEREMONY.

110
00:03:57,126 --> 00:03:58,327
DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED TO THE

111
00:03:58,327 --> 00:04:00,363
CONSEQUENCES THAT WE HOPED FOR.

112
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:05,568
>> ARE WE GOING TO HEAD WITH

113
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:07,136
HOPEFUL WISHFUL THOUGHTS?

114
00:04:07,136 --> 00:04:09,105
I FIND IT INCREDIBLY WORRYING

115
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:09,572
AND DEPRESSING.

116
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:13,709
>> NO KNOWLEDGE OF HISTORY.

117
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:14,977
IT IS STAGGERING TO REALIZE HOW

118
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:19,916
ON SELF-AWARE AND THE LACK OF

119
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:20,283
KNOWLEDGE.

120
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:21,284
>> Laura: THE LACK OF

121
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:21,651
KNOWLEDGE.

122
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:32,295
I DON'T RECALL MOST OF THESE

123
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:32,929
MEDIA ELITES GRIPING ABOUT

124
00:04:32,929 --> 00:04:33,529
EMBRACING DICTATORS WHEN

125
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:34,263
BARACK OBAMA RESTORED TIES WITH

126
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:34,964
THE CASTROS IN CUBA OR WHEN HE

127
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:35,665
GAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

128
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:38,034
DOLLARS TO THE DICTATORS IN

129
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:40,703
IRAN.

130
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:41,537
BOGUS DENUCLEARIZATION DEAL.

131
00:04:41,537 --> 00:04:44,240
WHEN HE HELD A STEAK DINNER FOR

132
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,074
THE CHINESE DICTATOR.

133
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:49,145
THE SELECTIVE MORAL OUTRAGE HERE

134
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:50,913
IS GALLING, PREDICTABLE, AND SO

135
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:51,714
BLATANT.

136
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:53,483
WHEN TRUMP TALKS TOUGH, THEY SAY

137
00:04:53,483 --> 00:04:55,518
HE IS A WARMONGER TAKING US TO

138
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:57,920
WAR.

139
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,323
BUT WHEN HE GETS DOWN GUYS TO

140
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:02,225
SIT AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE AND

141
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,127
BEGIN TO HAMMER OUT A PIECE

142
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,928
FRAMEWORK, HE IS SAVAGE FOR

143
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,663
EMBRACING A DICTATOR.

144
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:08,531
WHICH IS IT?

145
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:13,669
THEY BEAT HIM UP FOR SAYING HE

146
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:15,638
MAKE A CHANGE.

147
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:16,372
BUT TRUMP HIMSELF SAID, LISTEN

148
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:19,909
CAREFULLY, HE COULD BE WRONG.

149
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,511
>> I THINK HONESTLY I THINK HE'S

150
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:22,612
GOING TO DO THESE THINGS.

151
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:25,515
I MAY BE WRONG.

152
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,782
>> Laura: HE SET ALL HAVE TO

153
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:28,117
COME BACK AND APOLOGIZE.

154
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:28,618
I WOULD LIKE IT.

155
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:32,522
EVEN WITH THE HIGH-STAKES

156
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:33,189
INVOLVED, REALLY SERIOUS,

157
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,393
POSSIBLY DEADLY CONSEQUENCES OF

158
00:05:37,393 --> 00:05:39,328
FAILURE, PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES

159
00:05:39,328 --> 00:05:39,929
GEOPOLITICS FUN AGAIN.

160
00:05:39,929 --> 00:05:41,264
>> I MAY STAND BEFORE YOU IN SIX

161
00:05:41,264 --> 00:05:44,767
MONTHS AND SAY HEY, I WAS WRONG.

162
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,235
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WILL EVER

163
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:47,136
ADMIT THAT BUT I WILL FIND SOME

164
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:50,940
KIND OF EXCUSE.

165
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,141
>> Laura: THE DOUBTERS HAD TO

166
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:52,942
LAUGH A LITTLE.

167
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:53,709
HAVE SOME FUN.

168
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:55,845
IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE AN

169
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:56,212
AMERICAN.

170
00:05:56,212 --> 00:05:57,013
LIKE, WHO ELSE COULD HAVE GOTTEN

171
00:05:57,013 --> 00:05:59,315
US TO THIS POINT?

172
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,551
>> HE SAID OPENLY TO A COUPLE

173
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:06,022
REPORTERS WITH HIM THAT HE KNOWS

174
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:06,923
NO OTHER PRESIDENT EVER COULD

175
00:06:06,923 --> 00:06:08,124
HAVE DONE THIS.

176
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:10,726
>> Laura: WELL, OKAY, SO HE'S

177
00:06:10,726 --> 00:06:12,328
GOT A BIG EGO.

178
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,729
WHAT PRESIDENT DOESN'T?

179
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:14,964
BIG DEAL.

180
00:06:14,964 --> 00:06:17,033
ISN'T TRUMP'S PATH BETTER THAN

181
00:06:17,033 --> 00:06:18,367
THE ALTERNATIVE THE ELITES WERE

182
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,070
WARNING US ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO?

183
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,205
A NORTH KOREA THAT IS SO

184
00:06:22,205 --> 00:06:22,905
ISOLATED IT MIGHT THINK TO DO

185
00:06:22,905 --> 00:06:25,675
THE UNTHINKABLE, HIT AN AMERICAN

186
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:27,543
CITY WITH AN ICBM?

187
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:31,948
I SAY LET HIM DISTRACT US ALL,

188
00:06:31,948 --> 00:06:35,818
LET THEM KEEP GOING SLAPPING

189
