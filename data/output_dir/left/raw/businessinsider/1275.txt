Wow a trump win for the markets remember

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:04,740
it was the market was supposed to go

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,990

<font color="#CCCCCC">up the next morning and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's up and the</font>

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,120
next day it's up and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where</font>

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,519
it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from here because clearly nobody</font>

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,279
knows where it goes from here which i

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,470
think is the the main point market

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,820
timing doesn't work single<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock picking</font>

11
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,279
really very rarely works we spend all

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,460
this time in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> energy on these</font>

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,470
traditional ways of investing the

14
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,880
political pundits have already been

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,680
embarrassed because the man got elected

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they didn't call it but the market</font>

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,920
pundits didn't get embarrassed because

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,270
everyone was calling for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a down market</font>

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't happen and so the truth</font>

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,300
is back up right trying to play those

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,160
games of where's the Dow going to be

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,410
this year what sector is going to be up

23
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">its come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on guys the right way to do</font>

24
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,780
this is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> invest in a diversified</font>

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,039
portfolio in my case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe in ETFs</font>

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,800
and invest steadily and sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,149
going to think the market is high and

28
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be right darn it and you</font>

29
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,549
invested then bummer but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

30
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:10,290
you'll invest again the next month and

31
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,880
you will have bought on sale and

32
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,840
sometimes you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to think it's</font>

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,670
high and you'll be wrong I can't tell

34
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,320
you the number of people who told<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a</font>

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,570
little worried about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trump victory so</font>

36
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,070
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait to invest until</font>

37
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,409
afterwards and you're just brought you

38
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:24,450
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not that good in it we just</font>
