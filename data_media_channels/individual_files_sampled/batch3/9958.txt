Bret: WELCOME BACK TO "SPECIAL REPORT." JOINING ME LIVE IN STUDIO FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY A LITTLE TOUGHER TO MOTORCADE. TOUGH FOR EVERYBODY TODAY. Bret: I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A NEW BOOK OUT. I HAVE HEARD THAT YEAH. Bret: THANKS FOR BEING HERE. THE BOOK IS "HIGHER LOYALTY, TRUTH, LIES AND LEADERSHIP." BIG SALES IN ITS FIRST WEEK. I HAVE READ THE BOOK. I HAVE SEEN OR READ EVERY INTERVIEW THAT YOU HAVE DONE ON THIS MEDIA TOUR. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE FOCUSED ON PRESIDENT TRUMP AND YOUR INTERACTIONS. I WANT TO GET TO THAT BUT I WANT TO START CHRONOLOGICALLY WITH HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL PROBE AND THE DECISIONS YOU MADE. THERE IS IT TRUE THAT YOU AND YOUR FBI COLLEAGUES MADE THE DECISION TO EXONERATE SECRETARY CLINTON WELL BEFORE SHE WAS INTERVIEWED. NO. Bret: SO WHY WAIT UNTIL THE END AND WHY WRITE UP THE MEMO THAT YOU EVENTUALLY BRING FORWARD FIRST? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. COME MAY, AFTER WE HAD BEEN DOING IT FOR ABOUT 10 PART OF MY REGULAR BRIEFING FROM THE INVESTIGATORS, SEE THAT THEIR VIEW WAS IT WAS UNLIKELY TO END IN A CASE THAT THE PROSECUTORS AT DOJ WOULD BRING. Bret: BEFORE THE INTERVIEW. SURE. BECAUSE THEY HAD SPENT 10 MONTHS DIGGING AROUND, READING ALL HER EMAILS, PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER. INTERVIEWING EVERYBODY WHO SET UP HER SYSTEM. THEY WEREN'T CERTAIN OF THIS RESULT. THEY SAID LOOK, BOSS ON THE CURRENT COURSE AND SPEED IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT GOING TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE THE PROSECUTORS WILL BRING IT IN MAY I START THINKING OKAY, IF IT CONTINUES THAT WAY AND IT MAY NOT, IF IT CONTINUES THAT WAY HOW DO WE END THIS THING IN A CREDIBLE WAY. Bret: WHAT, IF ANYTHING, COULD SHE HAVE SAID IN THAT INTERVIEW THAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED YOUR MIND AND SOMEHOW CHANGED WHAT YOU EVENTUALLY DECIDED TO DO? WELL, TWO WAYS. FIRST, BY LYING IN A WAY WE COULD PROVE IN THE INTERVIEW OR GIVING US A HOOK TO CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO SEE IF WE COULD PROVE A LIE OR ADMITTING SOMETHING THAT WOULD SURPRISE US ABOUT HER INTENT. NOW, A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE ASKED GOOD QUESTION ABOUT WHY TO DO THE INTERVIEW AT THE END. THAT'S FAIRLY TYPICAL FOR A SUBJECT INTERVIEW IN A WHITE COLLAR INVESTIGATION. I THINK YOU SEE SPECIAL COUNSEL MUELLER TAKING EXACTLY THAT APPROACH WITH THE PRESIDENT. Bret: YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT SHE HAD BEEN TELLING, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY, INVESTIGATION OF WHAT AND HOW SHE HANDLED THOSE EMAILS. TAKE A LISTEN. SECRETARY CLINTON SAID THERE WAS NOTHING MARKED CLASSIFIED ON HER EMAILS EITHER SENT OR RECEIVED. WAS THAT TRUE? THAT'S NOT TRUE. SECRETARY CLINTON SAID I DID NOT EMAIL ANY CLASSIFIED MATERIAL TO ANYONE ON MY EMAIL. THERE IS NO CLASSIFIED MATERIAL. WAS THAT TRUE? THERE WAS CLASSIFIED MATERIAL EMAILED. SECRETARY CLINTON SAID ALL WORK-RELATED EMAILS WERE RETURNED TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT. WAS THAT TRUE? NO. WE FOUND WORK-RELATED EMAILS, THOUSANDS THAT WERE NOT RETURNED. Bret: SO IT WENT ON. THERE WERE CLEARLY A PATTERN THERE. AND HAD YOU ALREADY MADE YOUR DECISION. NO. I HAD NOT MADE MY DECISION, BUT I COULD SEE WHAT THE INVESTIGATORS SAW AFTER 10 MONTHS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GENERAL SENSE OF WHERE YOU ARE HEADED AFTER 10 MONTHS OF THAT KIND OF WORK, YOU ARE NOT COMPETENT. THEY COULD SEE IT WAS UNLIKELY, ALTHOUGH NOT CERTAIN, UNLIKELY TO GET US TO A PLACE WHERE THEY WOULD PROSECUTE IT AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. AND THE QUESTION WAS WOULD SHE LIE TO US? WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN THE YOU KNOW, IN A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN IS NOT OUR BUSINESS. OUR BUSINESS IS ARE YOU GOING TO LIE TO US AND IF YOU ARE AND WE CAN PROVE IT, THEN WE ARE GOING TO PROSECUTE YOU FOR IT. Bret: DID YOU GO BACK TO INTENT A LOT. ACTUALLY THE STATUTE AS IT'S WRITTEN HANDLING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION GROSSLY NEGLIGENT DOESN'T DEAL WIN TENT. GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IS EXPRESS PRESSURE OF KIND OF INTENT. HOW WERE YOU ACTING WHAT WAS YOUR MENTAL STATE AT THE TIME. Bret: YOU WERE CAREFUL TO CALL IT EXTREMELY CARELESS NOT GROSSLY NEGLIGENT. RIGHT. I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT WE THOUGHT IT WAS NOT MERE SLOPPINESS BUT DIDN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL MISCONDUCT THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTES. HOW DO YOU DESCRIBE THAT? I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SAID REALLY SLOPPY. I WANTED TO BE HONEST AND SAY IT'S ABOVE SLOPPY. IT DOESN'T ADD UP TO THE WHAT 1917 STATUTE MEANT WHEN IT SAID GROSSLY NEGLIGENT IS A FELONY. Bret: WHY DID YOU ALLOW CHERYL MILLS, SECRETARY CLINTON'S CHIEF OF STAFF, TO SIT IN ON THAT INTERVIEW? SHE WAS POTENTIAL ITLY A SUBJECT OR TARGET IN THE INVESTIGATION. SHE WAS A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE. SHE WASN'T CLINTON'S ATTORNEY. BUT, YET, SHE SITS IN THERE AND TALKS WITH HER THROUGHOUT THE INTERVIEW. YEAH. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS AT THAT TIME SHE WAS ONE OF CLINTON'S ATTORNEYS. SHE WAS NO LONGER A SUBJECT IN OUR INVESTIGATION. THE AGENTS HAD SCRUBBED HER CONDUCT VERY CAREFULLY BY THAT POINT AND SHE WAS NO LONGER A SUBJECT. THAT, AGAIN, THAT'S A REASONABLE QUESTION. BUT THE FACTS ARE NOT A SUBJECT. ONE OF CLINTON'S LAWYERS. SHE IS ENTITLED TO BE IN THE INTERVIEW. Bret: WE ASKED PEOPLE TO TWEET IN OR WRITE IN. WE HAVE ONE FROM JAY HARPER WILSON I'M A RETIRED FBI AGENT SERVING ALMOST 25 YEARS RETIRING IN 1995 AS SENIOR EQUITIESIVE SPECIAL AGENT PLEASE ASK THURSDAY WHY A GRAND JURY WAS NOT USED IN THE HILLARY CLINTON INVESTIGATION AS WOULD BE NORMAL AND WHY WAS IT RUN OUT OF H.Q.? BOOK DID NOT ADDRESS. YEAH. SECOND ONE I WILL TAKE FIRST. IT WAS RUN OUT OF HQ BECAUSE IT WAS A CASE OF INTENSE INTEREST. OUTSIDE TO THE MEDIA, AND SO TO KEEP IT TIGHT, IT WAS WORKED IN THE COUNTER INTELLIGENCE DIVISION AT HEADQUARTERS. YOU CAN REASONABLY DISAGREE WITH THAT IF YOU ARE AN FBI PERSON. COULD HAVE PUT IT IN WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE. COULD HAVE PUT IT IN NEW YORK. THE DECISION THAT COUNTER INTENTION MADE IT WILL BE KEPT TIGHTER AND LEAK-PROOF WHICH IT WAS CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE DIVISION. Bret: NO GRAND JURY. I'M NOT ALLOWED TO COMMENT ON THE WAY IN WHICH THE GRAND JURY WAS USED. I WILL SAY THIS THOUGH SHE WAS NOT INTERVIEWED IN FRONT OF A GRAND JURY WHICH IS ANOTHER JUDGMENT CALL THAT PROSECUTORS AND INVESTIGATORS MAKE ALL THE TIME. Bret: YOU THOUGHT THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL LORETTA LYNCH WAS COMPROMISED THAT YOU HAD TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF THAT TARMAC MEETING WITH FORMER PRESIDENT CLINTON AND BECAUSE SHE HAD WANTED TO CALL IT A MATTER, CORRECT? AND OTHER THINGS. Bret: AND OTHER THINGS IN THIS CLASSIFIED THING THAT ENDS UP LEAKING TO THE "NEW YORK TIMES." SHE DENIES. THIS SHE WRITES: IF HE HAD ANY CONCERNS REGARDING EMAIL INVESTIGATION, CLASSIFIED OR NOT, HE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO RAISE THEM WITH ME BOTH PRIVATELY AND IN MEETINGS. HE NEVER DID. SO, SOMEONE IS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH HERE. IS IT THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OR YOU? NO. ACTUALLY, I THINK WE ARE BOTH TELLING THE TRUTH. I NEVER WENT TO HER AND SAID LORETTA, I THINK YOU SHOULD RECUSE YOURSELF. MY PROBLEM WAS SHE HAD ALREADY ANNOUNCED IT AND THAT SHE WOULD ACCEPT MY RECOMMENDATION. AND SO AT THAT POINT WHAT DO I DO? AND I DECIDED AT THAT POINT I HAVE GOT TO STEP AWAY FROM HER. Bret: FAST FORWARD A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE UPSET HOW IT COMES OUT AND HOW YOU TAKE CONTROL. IT LEADS TO ROD ROSENSTEIN. HE CITES THIS IN WHAT YOU DID AS A REASON FOR RECOMMENDING YOUR FIRING. DID YOU GO ON AFTER THAT RECOMMENDATION YOU WRITE A LETTER TO CONGRESS TO ANNOUNCE THE CASE WE OPENED BECAUSE MORE CLASSIFIED EMAILS HAD BEEN FOUND ON ANTHONY WEINER'S COMPUTER. YOU SAID IT WAS, LAST NIGHT, A TOUGH CHOICE BETWEEN CONCEALING OR COMING FORWARD, A REALLY TOUGH CHOICE. BUT THERE ARE AUTHORITIES IN NEW YORK WHO ARE SAYING FBI HQ WAS SLOW-WALKING THAT CASE AND WEEKS WENT BY WITHOUT ANY ACTION. DID YOU KNOW THAT ANDREW MCCABE, YOUR DEPUTY, HAD SAT ON THAT REVELATION ABOUT THE EMAILS? YEAH, I DON'T KNOW THAT. I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE THE CASE. I DO KNOW THAT NEW YORK AND FBI HEADQUARTERS BECAME AWARE THAT THERE MAY BE SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN WEINER'S LAPTOP AND THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION WEEKS BEFORE IT WAS BROUGHT TO ME FOR A DECISION. AS I WRITE IN THE BOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY COULD HAVE MOVED FASTER AND WHY THE DELAY. Bret: WAS IT THE THREAT THAT THE NEW YORK AGENTS WERE GOING TO LEAK THAT IT EXISTED REALLY WHAT DROVE YOU TO THE NOT CONCEAL PART. I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK ACTUALLY WHAT DROVE IT WAS THE PROSECUTORS IN NEW YORK WHO WERE WORKING THE CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST WEINER CALLED DOWN TO HEADQUARTERS AND SAID ARE WE GETTING A SEARCH WARRANT OR NOT FOR THIS? THAT CAUSED I'M SORRY JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS TO THEN CALL ACROSS THE STREET TO THE FBI AND POKE THE ORGANIZATION AND THEY STARTED TO MOVE MUCH MORE QUICKLY. I DON'T KNOW WHY THERE WAS, IF THERE WAS SLOW ACTIVITY WHY IT WAS SLOW FOR THOSE FIRST COUPLE WEEKS. Bret: I WANT IT MOVE ONTO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE ARE TOLD AFTER THIS AUSTRALIAN DIPLOMAT REPORTS HIS CONVERSATION WITH GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS, TALKING ABOUT PLANS TO GET RUSSIA INFO OR EMAILS ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON THAT THE FBI IS NOTIFIED THROUGH THE STATE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THIS IN EARLY MAY, TRUE? NO. Bret: WHEN WERE THEY NOTIFIED. FIRST OF ALL, I'M NOT CONFIRMING WHAT THE SOURCE WAS FROM IT. THE FBI LEARNED THE INFORMATION ABOUT PAPADOPOULOS IN LATE JULY AND OPENED A COUNTER INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION AT THAT POINT. THE MEETING THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT OCCURRED IN THE SPRING. Bret: APRIL. BEFORE THERE WERE ANY PUBLIC REVELATION OF RUSSIAN HACKED EMAILS. BUT THE FBI DIDN'T LEARN ABOUT IT IN LATE JULY. Bret: OKAY. SO WHAT IS THE CRIME OR THE COLLUSION THAT LAUNCHES THE INVESTIGATION? COLLUSION IS NOT A WORD THAT I'M FAMILIAR WITH. Bret: WHAT IS THE CRIME? WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE BASICALLY THAT LAUNCHES? THE QUESTION IS YOU OPEN A COUNTER INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATION TO UNDERSTAND ARE ANY AMERICANS IN CAHOOTS INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES OF AN ADVERSARY NATION. Bret: WHEN THE STEELE DOSSIER COMES OUT, SOME TIME EARLY JULY, WHEN DID YOU PERSONALLY LEARN ABOUT THE MEMOS AND THE DOSSIER? SOME TIME IN THE FALL. I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHEN. Bret: YOU ARE TALKING FALL I'M SORRY, FALL OF '16. Bret: RIGHT. WHO SO WHO TELLING YOU ABOUT THEM. I DON'T REMEMBER. SOMEONE ON MY SENIOR STAFF. Bret: DO YOU REMEMBER HOW THEY WERE DESCRIBED. I REMEMBER THEY BRIEFED ME ABOUT IT EXPLAINED THEY CAME FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE. FORMER ALLIED INTELLIGENCE OFFICER. I REMEMBER BEING GIVEN A COPY OF IT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER. SOME TIME IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. Bret: WHEN DID YOU LEARN THAT THE DNC AND HILLARY CLINTON CAMPAIGN HAD FUNDED CHRISTOPHER STEELE'S WORK? I STILL DON'T KNOW THAT FOR A FACT. Bret: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I HAVE ONLY SEEN IT IN THE MEDIA. I NEVER KNEW EXACTLY WHICH DEMOCRATS HAD FUNDED. I KNEW IT WAS FUNDED FIRST BY REPUBLICANS. Bret: THAT'S NOT TRUE. I'M SORRY? Bret: THAT'S NOT TRUE THAT THE DOSSIER THAT CHRISTOPHER STEELE WORKED ON WAS FUNDED BY REPUBLICANS? MY UNDERSTANDING HIS WORK STARTED FUNDED AS OPO RESEARCH FUNDED BY REPUBLICANS. Bret: SO FREE BEACON SAID THAT THEY HAD GLENN SIMPSON AND FUSION GPS ON A RETAINER THEY DID NOT FUND THE CHRISTOPHER STEELE MEMO OR THE DOSSIER. THAT WAS INITIATED BY DEMOCRATS. OKAY. MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THE ACTIVITY WAS BEGUN, THAT STEELE WAS HIRED TO LOOK INTO FIRST FUNDED BY REPUBLICANS. THEN PICKED UP IMPORTANT THING WAS PICKED UP BY DEMOCRATS OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP. Bret: SO IS THAT WHY DID YOU TELL PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT THE DOSSIER WAS WHO IT WAS FUNDED BY? NO, NOT TO MY RECOLLECTION. DID HE WANT TO KNOW WHO IT WAS FUNDED BY. I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT I KNEW WHICH IT WAS FUNDED BY PEOPLE POLITICALLY OPPOSED BY DONALD TRUMP. WHICH PARTICULAR OPPONENTS WAS IMPORTANT TO ME. Bret: YOU STILL TO THIS DAY DON'T KNOW IT WAS FUNDED BY THE DNC. I HAVE READ THAT IN THE MEDIA BUT DIDN'T KNOW FOR A FACT AND DIDN'T KNOW WHILE I WAS AT THE FBI WHICH EXACT OPPONENT OF THE PRESIDENT'S FUNDED THAT. Bret: HOW MANY TIMES AND TO WHAT EXTENT DID YOU BRIEF PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE DOSSIER? I DIDN'T EVER BRIEF PRESIDENT OBAMA ON THE DOSSIER. I WAS PRESENT DURING A CONVERSATION WHERE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE BRIEFED IT TO HIM AS WE DID TO THE GANG OF EIGHT AND TO THE PRESIDENT-ELECT THE FIRST WEEK OF JANUARY. Bret: YOU CALLED THE DOSSIER UNVERIFIED, SALACIOUS. WHY DID YOU USE THAT TO THE FISA COURT TO ASK FOR SURVEILLANCE FOR CARTER PAGE? NOT ONLY USE IT BUT YOU LED WITH IT A BULK OF THAT FISA APPLICATION DEALS WITH THAT DOSSIER. WHY? YEAH. THAT'S NOT MY RECOLLECTION. BRET. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE FISA APPLICATION HAS BEEN RELEASED. MY RECOLLECTION WAS IT WAS PART OF A BROADER MOSAIC OF FACTS THAT WERE LAID BEFORE THE FISA JUDGE TO OBTAIN A FISA WARRANT. Bret: IT WAS A LOT MORE THAN THE DOSSIER IN THE FISA APPLICATION. MY RECOLLECTION WAS THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MATERIAL ABOUT PAGE AND WHY THERE WAS PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE HE WAS AN AGENT OF A FOREIGN POWER. AND THE DOSSIER WAS PART OF THAT BUT WAS NOT ALL OF IT OR A CRITICAL PART OF IT. MY RECOLLECTION Bret: INTEL BRIEFING AT TRUMP TOWER YOU BRIEFED THE PRESIDENT-ELECT ON THE SLIVER OF THE DOSSIER, REALLY THE SALACIOUS PART ABOUT THE PROSTITUTES IN MOSCOW AND THAT ALLEGATION. CORRECT. Bret: DIDN'T INCLUDE ANYTHING BROADER THAN THAT, CORRECT? CORRECT. MY MISSION THIS THAT PRIVATE BRIEFING WAS JUST TO TELL HIM ABOUT THAT SLICE OF IT. Bret: AND WHO SUGGESTED YOU BRIEF THAT? I THINK THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE DID AND EXPLAINED THE LOGIC OF WHY IT MADE SENSE FOR ME TO DO IT, WHICH I AGREED WITH. Bret: THAT BRIEFING WAS JUST ORAL. JUST TALKING. RIGHT. JUST THE TWO OF US TALKING TO EACH OTHER. Bret: CNN ROARED A TIME YOU HANDED TWO PAGE SUMMARY OF THE DOSSIER OVER TO HIM. DID I NOT. Bret: DID NOT. SPEAKING OF CNN YOU WRITE IN THE MEMOS OF THAT MEETING YOU WRITE I SAID TO PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP MEDIA LIKE CNN HAD THE DOSSIER AND WERE LOOKING FOR A NEWS HOOK. I SAID IT WAS INFLAMMATORY STUFF. THE STORY OF THAT BRIEFING LEAKS OUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU DO IT. CNN AND OTHERS RUN THE STORY OF THIS UNVERIFIED DOSSIER. DID YOU OR YOUR SUBORDINATES LEAK THAT. NO. DID JAMES CLAPPER? NO. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NO. Bret: JOHN BRENNAN. I DON'T KNOW WHO LEAKED IT. I HAD NO PART IN LEAKING ANY OF IT. IT WAS FOUR OR FIVE DAYS LATER THAT IT LEAKED. I REMEMBER BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT-ELECT CALLED ME ABOUT IT. Bret: DID YOU EVER TRY TO FIND OUT. WHO LEAKED UNCLASSIFIED PUBLIC DOCUMENT? NO. Bret: DID YOU INFORM THE PRESIDENT-ELECT AT THE TIME WHAT YOU KNEW ABOUT HOW IT WAS FUNDED OR WHO WAS BEHIND IT. NO, I DID NOT. Bret: DID YOU INFORM HIM THAT CHRISTOPHER STEELE HAD BEEN FIRED BY THE FBI? NO. Bret: OR THAT HE HAD LIED. NO. AND I DIDN'T KNOW THOSE THINGS AT THAT TIME ANYWAY. Bret: OR HAD ABUSED AT LEAST IN PART TO GET THIS FISA APPLICATION TO SPY ON SOMEBODY IN HIS CAMPAIGN. NO. DIDN'T COME UP. Bret: IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA. CARTER PAGE WAS IN HIS CAMPAIGN WHEN THE FISA ORDER WAS. Bret: TANGENTIALLY. AT ONE POINT, CORRECT. Bret: IS IT FAIR TO IS A PRESIDENT OBAMA IN HIS INNER CIRCLE KNEW A LOT MORE ABOUT THE DOSSIER AND SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION THAN PRESIDENT-ELECT AND HIS TEAM. NO. I DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR AT ALL. Bret: YOU THINK THEY WERE EQUAL AS FAR AS THE BRIEFING? AS FAR AS I KNOW THEY KNEW THE SAME SET OF FACTS AS DID THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS. Bret: THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE FBI TOLD THE FISA COURT AND WHAT THE ABOUT THE TRUMP-RUSSIA INVESTIGATION AND WHAT YOU TOLD THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES? WHAT THE FBI AND THE FISA APPLICATION SAID IN OCTOBER OF 2016? I DON'T REMEMBER CLEAR ENOUGH ALL THAT'S IN THE FISA APPLICATION BUT WE SURE DIDN'T LAY THAT OUT FOR ANYBODY, PRESIDENT OBAMA, PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP, OR THE LEADERS OF CONGRESS. Bret: OKAY. A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTERACTIONS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND YOUR MEMOS MEMORIALIZING THAT. AFTER YOU'RE FIRED ON CAPITOL HILL, WE LEARNED THIS: '17. I ASKED A FRIEND OF MINE TO SHARE THE CONTENT OF THE MEMO WITH A REPORTER. DIDN'T DO IT MYSELF FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT I ASKED HIM TO BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT MIGHT PROMPT THE APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL. SO I ASKED A CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE TO DO IT. WHO WAS THAT? A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO IS A PROFESSOR AT COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL. Bret: SO WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID YOU LEAK TO MR. RICHMAN? I SENT MR. RICHMAN A COPY OF A TWO-PAGE UNCLASSIFIED MEMO AND ASKED HIM TO GET THE SUBSTANCE OF IT OUT TO THE MEDIA. Bret: YOU CALL HIM A GOOD FRIEND AND PROFESSOR BUT YOU DIDN'T REVEAL YOU HAD HIRED EMPLOYEE FOR THE FBI TO WORK ON SPECIAL PROJECTS. WHY? BECAUSE IT WASN'T RELEVANT. HE WAS FBI SPECIAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE UNTIL FEBRUARY OF 2000 Bret: DID YOU HAVE OTHER SPECIAL ADVISORS LIKE THAT. NO, HUH-UH. Bret: WHAT EXACTLY WAS HIS JOB? TWO THINGS. HIS PRIMARY FOCUS WAS OUR GOING DARK CHALLENGE. HELPING US THINK THROUGH AND ARTICULATE AND FIGHT FOR ACCESS TO ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS AND THEN LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA WAS A BIG PART OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES. Bret: DID YOU LEAK OTHER THINGS THROUGH MR. RICHMAN. YEAH. THE REASON I'M SMILING, BRET. I DON'T CONSIDER WHAT I SHARED MR. RICHMAN A LEAK. I TOLD LET ME ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. I GAVE HIM NOTHING ELSE EVER TO SHARE WITH THE MEDIA. Bret: FBI PROTOCOL SAYS YOUR OWN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE FBI PROHIBITS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF ANY INFORMATION OR MATERIAL FROM OR RELATED TO FBI FILES OR ANY INFORMATION ACQUIRED BY VIRTUE OF MY OFFICIAL EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT PRIOR WRITTEN PERMISSION FROM THE FBI. DID HAVE YOU WRITTEN PERMISSION? NO. AND I DIDN'T CONSIDER IT PART OF AN FBI FILE. ALL THE THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT. Bret: YOU WROTE IT AS FBI DIRECTOR. IT WAS WORK PRODUCT. NO. IT WAS NOT. IT WAS MY PERSONAL AID TO MEMOIR. Bret: MEETING PRESIDENT. I CARRIED TWO COPIES OF IT. ONE TO KEEP IN MY PERSONAL SAFE AT HOME AND I LEFT ANOTHER ONE AT THE FBI SO THE BUREAU COULD ALWAYS HAVE ACCESS TO IT. I ALWAYS THOUGHT OF IT AS MINE LIKE A DIARY. Bret: WHO ELSE DID YOU GIVE, LEAK, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT. USE IS WHAT I PREFER. Bret: THE MEMOS TO. I GAVE THE MEMOS TO MY LEGAL TEAM AFTER I GAVE THEM TO DAN RICHMAN AFTER I GAVE THEM TO THE MEDIA. I'M SORRY, GAVE FOUR MEMOS TO MY LEGAL TEAM. Bret: WHICH INCLUDED PATRICK FITZGERALD. HE WAS A LEGAL TEAM AT THAT TIME. CORRECT, SURE. DAVID KELLY AND DAN RICHMAN. Bret: YOU SAID IN THE MEMOS I SAID I DON'T DO SNEAKY THINGS, I DON'T LEAK. I DON'T DO WEASEL MOVES. WE CAN ARGUE WHAT A LEAK IS BUT THAT'S A LEAK, ISN'T IT? IT'S NOT. Bret: OKAY. HERE'S WHAT YOU TOLD CHUCK GRASSLEY ABOUT LEAKING. DIRECTOR COMEY, HAVE YOU SOURCE IN NEWS REPORTS ABOUT MATTERS RELATING TO THE TRUMP INVESTIGATION OR THE CLINTON INVESTIGATION? NEVER. HAS ANY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION RELATING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP OR HIS ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATES BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND SHARED WITH THE MEDIA? NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. Bret: SO AT WHAT POINT WERE YOU MADE AWARE THAT SOME OF THE INFORMATION WAS CLASSIFIED BY THE FBI? WHICH INFORMATION? Bret: IN THE MEMOS? OH, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW, SOME TIME AFTER I WAS FIRED THE FBI APPARENTLY MADE A DECISION THAT THERE WERE SOME WORDS IN AT LEAST TWO OF THE MEMOS, MAYBE ONE, I THINK TWO, THAT WERE DIPLOMATICALLY SENSITIVE. AND SO MY LAWYERS RETURNED THEM TO THE FBI. BUT MY TESTIMONY WAS TRUTHFUL AND I STAND BY IT I WAS HOPING YOU WERE GOING TO ASK ME THAT. Bret: I AM. I WAS. IT WAS TRUTHFUL. Bret: I WANT TO PLAY WHAT ABOUT YOU ON THIS CHANNEL. LOOK, COMEY IS A LEAKER AND HE'S A LIAR. AND NOT ONLY ON THIS STUFF, HE'S BEEN LEAKING FOR YEARS. HE'S PROBABLY BEEN USING HIS FRIEND, THE SO-CALLED TO HAVE FBI CLEARANCE, WHICH HE NEVER SAID. HE EVEN LIED ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE HE NEVER SAID THAT IN CONGRESS. HE SAID HE GAVE IT TO A FRIEND. AND HE GAVE IT TO A FRIEND TO LEAK CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. IT'S ALL CLASSIFIED. IT WAS TOTALLY CLASSIFIED. SO ILLEGALLY HE DID AN ILLEGAL ACT AND HE SAID IT HIMSELF. IN ORDER TO GET A SPECIAL COUNSEL AGAINST ME. Bret: REACTION TO THAT? HE IS JUST WRONG. FACTS REALLY DO MATTER, WHICH IS WHY I'M ON THE SHOW TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THAT MEMO WAS UNCLASSIFIED THEN. IT'S STILL UNCLASSIFIED. IT'S IN MY BOOK. THE FBI CLEARED THAT BOOK BEFORE IT COULD BE PUBLISHED. THAT'S A FALSE STATEMENT. Bret: WHAT ABOUT NOT TELLING CONGRESS THAT HE WAS AN AGENT FOR YOU OR WORKED AT THE FBI OR SOMEHOW WAS SOME EMPLOYEE THAT HAD YOU 35,000 FBI EMPLOYEES. NONE OF THAT WAS TRUE I MEAN, I DESCRIBED YOU HIM I HOPE GOOD FRIEND. EXPOSE BIAS CONNECTION TO THE GUY? HE HAD LEFT HIS FBI JOB MONTHS EARLIER. THERE IS LOTS OF OTHER CONNECTIONS. I KNOW HIM BECAUSE WE WERE
