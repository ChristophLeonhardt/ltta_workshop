1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,370
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS STEPPED
IN IT FOR UNDERSTANDABLE

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,090
ISSUES ON THE ISSUE OF STORMY
DANIELS.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:11,139
THE ADULT ACTRESS WHO HAD AN
AFFAIR WITH DONALD TRUMP

4
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:14,860
EXPLAINED IN GLORY
DETAIL BACK IN 2011,

5
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,990
DONALD TRUMP GOT HIS LAWYER TO
DO AN NDA.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:28,029
MICHAEL COHEN SAYS I HAPPEN TO
DO THE NDA AND I'M THE ONE

7
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:34,410
THAT PAID HER SO OBVIOUSLY THAT
IS WHO IT WAS FOR.

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,260
NOW STORMY DANIELS SAYS IT IS
NOT VALID BECAUSE DONALD

9
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,170
TRUMP NEVER SIGNED IT.

10
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,910
IT WAS NOT TO HUSH UP ABOUT
ANYTHING RELATED TO MICHAEL

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,120
COHEN THOUGHT IT WAS A HUSH
CONTRACT ABOUT THE AFFAIR

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,180
SHE HAD WITH DONALD TRUMP.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,930
SHE IS IN AN IMPOSSIBLE
SITUATION BECAUSE DONALD

14
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,040
TRUMP HAS ASKED HER TO LIE 13
DIFFERENT WAYS SO SHE

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,690
ACCIDENTALLY SCREWS UP AND ADMIT
SOMETHING THAT IS TRUE.

16
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:19,240
DON'T GET ME WRONG SHE'S THE
PRESS SECRETARY 

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
FOR DONALD

18
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
TRUMP.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,810
MADE VERY CLEAR THAT NONE OF
THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE.

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,730
AND AGAIN THIS CASE HAS ALREADY
BEEN ONE IN ARBITRATION

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,560
ANYTHING BEYOND THAT I WOULD
REFER YOU TO OUTSIDE COUNSEL.

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:44,200
YOU SAID THERE IS ARBITRATION
THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN WON?

23
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,400
FOR DETAILS ON THAT I WOULD
REFER YOU THEM.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,570
I CAN SHARE THAT ARBITRATION WAS
ONE IN THE PRESIDENT'S FAVOR.

25
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,200
HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT ABOUT THIS AND AS I

26
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,670
OUTLINED EARLIER THIS CASE IT
ALREADY BEEN ONE IN ARBITRATION.

27
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,240
OOPS.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:11,420
THE REPORTER HAD A PUZZLED LOOK
ON HIS FACE AND RIGHTFULLY SO.

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,560
IT TURNS OUT THERE WAS
ARBITRATION IN THE CASE WHICH

30
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,451
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS SHOULD
NOT HAVE ADMITTED BECAUSE THAT

31
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:22,440
ADMITS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS
INVOLVED.

32
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,560
WHAT IS THE UNTRUE

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
PART OF HER STATEMENT?

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,230
THAT HE
WON THE ARBITRATION.

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,870
THEY WENT TO AN ARBITRATION
HEARING WITHOUT STORMY DANIELS.

36
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,980
MICHAEL COHEN AND CALLED FOR A
SECRET ARBITRATION MEETING,

37
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:43,980
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

38
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:50,280
SECOND OF ALL THEY DID NOT WIN
IT, THEY GOT A TEMPORARY

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,560
RESTRAINING ORDER SAYING DON'T
TALK ABOUT THIS IN PUBLIC

40
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:02,170
UNTIL WE CAN HAVE PROCEEDINGS
AND CONCLUDE THEM.

41
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,981
AND HE DIDN'T SIGN THE CONTRACT
SO YOU CAN'T HAVE AN

42
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:11,819
ARBITRATION PROCEEDING ABOUT A
CONTRACT THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

43
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,620
ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE OF HER
WINNING IT, SHE IS WRONG.

44
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:19,670
THE FACT THAT HAPPENED IS
CORRECT.

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,040
THAT THEN MAKES TRUMP APPARENTLY
ANGRY.

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:37,590
CNN'S JIM ACOSTA DOING 

47
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,890
THE MAIN
REPORTING HERE.

48
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,640
SO TODAY OF COURSE THE TRUMP
WHITE HOUSE IS DENYING MAINLY

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,750
THROUGH FOX NEWS ñ SOURCES TELL
FOX NEWS THAT SARAH HUCKABEE

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,650
SANDERS CAME OUT FOR A
PRESS CONFERENCE ñ

51
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,120
OH THAT'S RIGHT SHE DIDN'T.

52
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,630
IF TRUMP IS NOT UPSET WITH HER
AND THERE IS NO ISSUES THEY

53
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,290
HAVE A CURIOUS WAY OF SHOWING
IT.

54
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:20,809
LET ME GIVE YOU ONE MORE.

55
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:27,029
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING WHY
TRUMP CARES SO MUCH, HE'S HAD

56
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:31,240
DOZENS OF AFFAIRS, DOZENS OF
WOMEN ACCUSED HIM OF SEXUAL

57
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,409
HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT WHICH IS
FAR WORSE THAN ANY AFFAIR.

58
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,139
STORMY DANIELS AND HER LATEST
COURT FILING SAID THAT SHE HAS

59
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:46,120
TEXTS AND PICTURES, THAT IS WHY
HE WAS TRYING TO COVER IT UP.

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,479
THAT IS WHY HE IS UPSET IT
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS FOR

61
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,759
SCREWING UP AND ADMITTING IT IS
REAL.

62
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,529
ONE LAST THING, PEOPLE ARE
GETTING ALL OVER SARAH

63
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,560
HUCKABEE SANDERS, I WILL DO AN
IRONIC DEFENSE.

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,550
THAT JOB IS IMPOSSIBLE.

65
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,909
TRUMP ASKED YOU TO LIE IN BOTH
DIRECTIONS, IT IS NOT DOABLE.

66
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:25,490
JUMP IS NOT AT ALL INVOLVED
BUT HE WON THE CASE.

67
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,650
GARY COHEN LEFT ñ
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

68
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,300
WHO CAN SEND THIS GUY.

69
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,740
AND THE PRICE SARAH HUCKABEE
SANDERS HAS HUNG IN THERE

70
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,430
FOR THAT LONG.

71
00:05:38,430 --> 00:00:00,000
IT IS A MISERABLE JOB TO HAVE.
