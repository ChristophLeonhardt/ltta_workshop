JOINING US TONIGHT, AS WE WATCH
THESE RACES PLAY OUT.
IT WILL BE A LATE TONIGHT.
AN EARLY MORNING A LOT OF
PLACES.
THANK YOU, PATRICK.
FOX NEWS CANNOT PROJECT THAT
GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE GAVIN
NEWSOM, CURRENTLY LIEUTENANT
GOVERNOR IN CALIFORNIA,
DEFINITELY GOING TO BE ONE OF
THE TOP TWO FINISHERS IN
CALIFORNIA’S JUNGLE PRIMARY.
HE WILL ADVANCE AS EXPECTED TO
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
IT’S TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE THE
OTHER CANDIDATES, BECAUSE IT
DOESN’T MATTER PARTY.
WE’LL SEE WHICH ONE GETS THE
MOST VOTES.
JOHN COX IS RUNNING STRONG,
EARLY RETURNS, STILL WAITING,
SOME PROBLEMS IN LOS ANGELES.
