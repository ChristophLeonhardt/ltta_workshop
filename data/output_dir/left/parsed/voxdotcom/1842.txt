The Me Too Movement
What is a non-verbal cue?
They are just so fucking fragile.
Where is the line now?
No. Not really, no
Not really.
Never in the workplace.
Weeellll... yes...
I've never been harassed at work.
Not directly.
Of course, yeah.
No, because I had my stand.
I did my internship and one man
approached me and I said
"only time I'm gonna touch your penis is to put it in the syringe."
Yes he approached me.
He approached me, he
took his penis out and asked me to hold it.
Between 60 and 70% of women don't report sexual harassment,
because they weren't sure that it was serious enough.
Oh my god.
That's really sad.
Yeah, I believe that. I'm surprised it's not more.
I, in my work as an RA,
I come up with that a lot
because I'm always you know offering
resources, telling women what our options are.
And so many of them just say
"I don't want to go through that ordeal, I
know it's gonna end poorly".
And I -- how can
I disagree with that?
I struggled when everyone was posting the Me Too
stuff online.
Like, it... does my
story count?
Or am I detracting from this
movement, you know, I want to say Me Too
to like acknowledge how prevalent
all of this is,
but if no one grabbed me,
if it was a compliment that really
was inappropriate for the workplace you know?
It's like that... it was always on that line.
I don't know any woman, my age,
I can't speak for younger who hasn't
been the object of sexual harassment.
They would always take the male side,
because the male was in power.
Like, I went for a job interview one time
as a waitress
and I had waitressing
experience
and the man said "turn around and walk away from me so I can see your legs."
And... it's... you know, so I did.
I mean, we did. We just expected it.
Those were the days, you know, every man was entitled
and every woman was not entitled.
Do you think that the way this movement is happening, do you think it will have a positive impact?
Are you optimistic about the movement?
Oh, yes.
It's going to have an impact.
It already has, I feel.
I don't think it's gonna go away,
because women are free and
they feel -- they now know that other women
are experiencing the same.
We just have to find our place.
I hope it continues, I think there is a lot of potential there.
But it feels like everything is so up in the air these days
that I have no idea how long it'll
last before people say "this has gone too far"
and like, "these accusations aren't
big enough"
and that's my fear.
It's catching on, I mean women everywhere are
hearing it.
There has to be momentum.
I think it's there and, you know, women's
lives will be better.
I think it's not
about women, it's about men.
That's the change that needs to take place and
right now I really only see women
claiming Me Too.
So, question mark. For now.
