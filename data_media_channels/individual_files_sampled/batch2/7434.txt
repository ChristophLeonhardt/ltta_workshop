one of the great successes of the past few years is that finally efforts to raise the minimum wage have actually been working in a lot of different parts of the country wages are going up thanks to the work of a lot of activists in some areas people in say the service industry are finally being paid as much as $15 per hour which you might think is a good thing for them but you'd be wrong and Fox Business is Stu Varney is here to tell you why that's actually bad for workers I think this is a tragedy yeah because all those entry-level positions are going because some people now get 15 bucks an hour you with me I'm with you 100% it me it's all done under the guise of helping the working man what about the guy who loses his job homie said they helped him you're never gonna get any source or any administration or any local government to lower the minimum wage again so I can tell you the server's don't like it the people who are the recipient of this increase don't like it because they all feel that their job security has now been tampered with yeah the tips go down no because it doesn't affect tips it's all on the employer the $50 if I walk into a restaurant and I know that the waiter waitress is making 15 bucks an hour any more than they used to make the previous year I'm gonna think wait a minute are you gonna give me am I gonna give you 20 percent ya know whatever Stuart we haven't seen that as yeah it's an interesting observation and it's actually even worse than that for a lot of these waiters their pants will start to fall down from all the dollar bills weighing down their pockets now but no and the hypothetical they're giving there isn't even accurate because not all but in some of the cases where the minimum wage has gone up there is usually some sort of exemption or lower increase for people who are earning tips but in their hypothetical oh my god $15 now it is ruining my life because now she passes like Stu Varney who I'm sure Tippin 30 40 percent right now I feel they should chip less yeah so my favorite was the beginning it's a tragedy it's pride every tweet I see from fight for 15 at air rolls so $15 a if if you work all year long is around $31,000 a year but if you got tips on top tragedy well think about I mean what if one of these waiters buys a yacht and then the yacht crashes okay and then they bring on a CEO to go oh yeah tragedy 100% agree I can't I have to pay more I mean I feel bad for the server's yeah and then but then at the end he can't even backups to a point he's like oh the tips are disappearing right he's like well man we haven't seen any evidence of that but if you say so we're on a fox right we can say anything we want yeah look I think that there's an interesting argument to be made at some point about hey how do we balance out the the wages because it used to be two dollars because you were getting tips what should my earn 235 when I was living off the tips that's right so how much should be tips etc but that argument is not going to be had in a legitimate way from a multi-millionaire anchor saying I don't want to tip you anymore because you're making too much money I agree so Stuart Varney with all due respect no with no respect at all go ahead and piss off if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm slash joy
