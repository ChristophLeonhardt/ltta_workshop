00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,270
it's nice to feel at home in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:11,910
you've always lived to finally know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,139
if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever did say your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> body is not</font>

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:25,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay which one of us would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be wrong it's</font>

5
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:31,769
nice to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> for fun because I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

6
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">and not here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back of my mind</font>

7
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,930
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have got to this sooner</font>

8
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,780
did you see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wobble did you see that</font>

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,410
tremor to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this body won't push</font>

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,170
me forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it also won't push me</font>

11
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,250
back but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to be enthusiastic</font>

12
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what's in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mirror to know that</font>

13
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:07,129
my body will no longer get in the way

14
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,830
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> now fully understand the</font>

15
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,770
consequences<font color="#CCCCCC"> are far fewer and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

16
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,049
they were for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hating the way I look in</font>

17
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:22,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that dress and that if I want to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:00:00,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't necessarily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to weigh this</font>
