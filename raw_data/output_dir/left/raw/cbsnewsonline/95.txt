RETURNED BY THE NORTH KOREANS. 

34
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,569
THE REMAINS OF THE 55 CASES ARE 

35
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,838

42
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:25,552
BEGIN THEIR METICULOUS TESTING. 

43
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:26,686
THE SCIENTIST AND THE 

44
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,888
CAPABILITIES OF OUR LABS WILL 

45
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:29,589
BE CHALLENGED. 

46
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,090
IN THE MONTHS AND THE YEARS 

47
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,492

49
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,730
FAMILIES LONG-SOUGHT ANSWERS. 

50
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:43,670
WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THE ONE 

51
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,504
AUGUST REPATRIATION IS THE 

52
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,905
FIRST TANGIBLE ACTION OF OTHERS 

53
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,440
WITH WHICH WHICH WE CAN ACCOUNT 

54
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,243
FOR MORE MISSING FROM THE 

55
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:52,111
KOREAN WAR. 

56
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,713
THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE 

57
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,181
SINGAPORE COMMITMENT WAS THE 

58
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,549
RECOVERY OF REMAINS IN NORTH 

59
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:59,319
KOREA WHICH THE PRK OFFICIALS 

60
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:04,023
REAFFIRMED LAST MONTH. 

61
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,158
WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF 

62
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,459
EXPLORING NEXT STEPS AS WELL AS 

63
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,694
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE KOREAN 

64
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:08,695
PEOPLE'S ARMY FOR THE EXPRESS 

65
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,130
PURPOSE OF RESUMING JOINT FIELD 

66
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,464
OPERATIONS AND HAVING 

67
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,565
ADDITIONAL REPATRIATION'S. 

68
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,901
OUR MISSION TO SEARCH FOR, FIND 

69
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,505
AND ACCOUNT FOR MISSING 

70
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,172
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE PERSONNEL 

71
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,139
FROM WORLD WAR II THROUGH 

72
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,209
OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM IS NOT 

73
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:25,211
LIMITED TO THE KOREAN PENINSULA.

74
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,548
TODAY 186 PERSONNEL FROM DPA AND

75
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,750
PRIVATE PARTNERS ARE DEPLOYED 

76
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,952
IN SEVEN NATIONS. 

77
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,253
YESTERDAY 50 OF THOSE MEMBERS 

78
00:02:34,253 --> 00:02:37,924
RETURNED FROM LAOS AND THE 

79
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,759
PHILIPPINES. 

80
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,226
OUR GLOBAL MISSION IS 

81
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:42,528
HUMANITARIAN IN EVERY RESPECT. 

82
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,529
THE IMPACT OF A MISSING 

83
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:45,765
AMERICAN TO THEIR FAMILY IS NOT 

84
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:47,767
CONSTRAINED BY TIME OR 

85
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:50,436
GENERATIONS. IT LEAVES AN 

86
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:54,574
ENDURING PAIN AND VOID. 

87
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,842
THIS IS WHY FORMER ENEMIES LIKE 

88
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,709
VIETNAM USED COOPERATION ON THE 

89
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,745
POW MIA MISSION AS A BRIDGE TO 

90
00:02:58,745 --> 00:02:59,645
NORMALIZATION AND TODAY'S 

91
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:01,447
DRIVING BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP 

92
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,350
WITH THE UNITED STATES. 

93
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,485
THE FACT THAT THE UNITED STATES 

94
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:06,786
OF AMERICA VIGOROUSLY PURSUES 

95
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,787
THE FULLEST POSSIBLE ACCOUNTING 

96
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,223
OF ARE MISSING REFLECTS OUR 

97
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,192
VALUES AS A NATION. 

98
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,560
THE SACRED OBLIGATION IF NOT 

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,330
MORAL IMPERATIVE REMAINS A HIGH 

100
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,831
PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF 

101
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:19,866
DEFENSE. 

102
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,770
INHERIT TO THE EXCEPTIONAL 

103
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,637
TEAMWORK, RESOURCES AND THE 

104
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,170
RESOLUTENESS PROVIDED BY 

105
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,639
MULTIPLE AGENCIES IS A SOLEMN 

106
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,207
VOW THAT THOSE WHO ARE SENT OFF 

107
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,043
IN HARMS WAY AND ARE MISSING 

108
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,214
WILL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. 

109
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,048
THEIR FAMILIES WILL RECEIVE 

110
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,849
ANSWERS TO THEIR DECADES OF 

111
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:37,182
UNCERTAINTY. 

112
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:38,518
MY COLLEAGUES AND I WELCOME 

113
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:39,752
YOUR QUESTIONS. 

114
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:46,092
>> PRESIDENT CLINTON IN 2000 

115
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,593
WENT TO A PLACE IN VIETNAM 

116
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:48,628
NORTH OF HANOI WHERE ONE OF 

117
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:50,163
THESE RECOVERY EFFORTS WERE 

118
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,931
UNDERWAY, EVEN THERE THINGS 

119
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:53,433
WERE DISCOVERED AND IT TAKES A 

120
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:57,637
LONG TIME TO JUST -- ESTABLISH 

121
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,339
THE FORENSIC TRAIL. 

122
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,708
WHAT CONDITIONS ARE THE REMAINS 

123
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,844
OR THE PARTS OF REMAINS? HOW 

124
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,145
CHALLENGING WILL THE FORENSIC 

125
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,681
WORK BE? ARE YOU A LONG WAYS 

126
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,184
AWAY OR WHAT YOU RECEIVED IS IS 

127
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,719
SOMETHINGTO GET YOU TO 

128
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,456
IDENTIFY AND CONFIRM? 

129
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:17,290
>> WE CHARACTERIZE THE 

130
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,925
PRESERVATION OF THE REMAINS AS 

131
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,793
MODERATE TO POOR AS A GENERAL 

132
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:22,161
CONSIDERATION. 

133
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,297
HOWEVER, WHAT OUR LAB IS 

134
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,333
SPECIALIZES IN IS MAKING 

135
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,000
IDENTIFICATION IN CIRCUMSTANCES 

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,635
WHERE YOU HAVE LITTLE TO WORK 

137
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:30,169
WITH. 

138
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,807
I AM CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE 

139
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:35,842
GOING TO DO WELL WITH THE 

140
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,043
REMAINS OF THE 55 BOXES OVER 

141
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,478
THE COMING MONTHS AND MAYBE THE 

142
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,847
NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 

143
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,583
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS AT 

144
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,652
STAKE, WE WILL BE DOING A LOT 

145
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,855
OF DNA SAMPLING, THAT IS WHAT 

146
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,889
DOCTOR McMAHON'S LAB DOES IS 

147
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,491
THEY PROCESS SAMPLES AND THEN 

148
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,726
THEY GO INTO A MASSIVE DATABASE 

149
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:54,961
WHERE THEY CAN BE COMPARED TO 

150
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,897
THE OTHER SAMPLES THAT WE HAVE 

151
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:58,965
GENERATED FROM REMAINS FROM 

152
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,833
NORTH KOREA AND ALSO COMPARED 

153
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:01,967
TO THE FAMILY MEMBERS. 

154
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:04,170
IT TAKES TIME TO GET THE 

155
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,304
SAMPLES PROCESSED THROUGH THE 

156
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:10,176
LAB, IT TAKES TIME TO GET THEM 

157
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:12,478
INTO THE MASS COMPARISON. 

158
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,082
ONCE THEY ARE IN THERE, WE WILL 

159
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,183
START LOOKING FOR QUICK 

160
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:17,917
IDENTIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE 

161
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,285
MADE WHERE YOU HAVE COMPELLING 

162
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:22,789
MATCHES THAT SHOW THEMSELVES 

163
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:23,489
EARLY ON. 

164
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,924
WE ALSO LOOK FOR COMPARISONS TO 

165
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,760
DENTAL RECORDS THAT CAN BE 

166
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,030
DISTINCTIVE. 

167
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,964
WE LOOK FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT 

168
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:33,132
ARE UNUSUAL IN THE SENSE OF 

169
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,167
BEING VERY TALL, VERY SHORT, 

170
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,735
VERY OLD, ANYTHING THAT WILL 

171
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,604
DISTINGUISH SOMEBODY WE COULD 

172
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,173
GET A GOOD CLUE AND IDENTIFY 

173
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,240
THEM FASTER. 

174
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,475
BECAUSE OF THE PRESERVATION OF 

175
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,812
THE REMAINS, THAT WILL GUIDE 

176
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,013
THE METHODS THAT WE CAN BRING 

177
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,247
TO BEAR ON THE CASE. 

178
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,215
THE CASE WILL BE VERY DNA 

179
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:53,252
INTENSIVE IN TERMS OF THE WAY 

180
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,921
WE GO ABOUT THIS. 

181
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,790
>> WHAT DOES THAT NUMBER 

182
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,327
REPRESENT? 55 INDIVIDUALS? 

183
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:02,695
>> NO. 

184
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,431
IT IS THE NUMBER OF BOXES THAT 

185
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:09,502
THE REMAINS CAME IN. 

186
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,003
AT NO TIME DID WE EXPECT THERE 

187
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,839
TO BE ONE BODY, ONE BOX. 

188
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,440
NOR DID THEY TRY TO PITCH IT 

189
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,309
THAT WAY TO US. 

190
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:22,114
>> WHAT TYPE OF CERTAINTY DO 

191
00:06:22,114 --> 00:06:23,115
YOU HAVE THAT THE REMAINS THAT 

192
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:27,453
THE NORTH KOREANS HANDED OVER 

193
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:28,688
ARE THAT OF MISSING AMERICANS 

194
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:29,655
AS OPPOSED TO OTHER 

195
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,790
NATIONALITIES THAT FOUGHT 

196
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,991
ALONGSIDE THE AMERICANS? 

197
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,895
>> WE HAVE A HIGH CONFIDENCE. 

198
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,530
IN THE EARLY 90s FOR FIVE 

199
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,198
YEARS, THE NORTH KOREANS WOULD 

200
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:43,703
REPATRIATE UNILATERALLY REMAINS 

201
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,236
THAT THEY RECOVERED. 

202
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:46,072
OUT OF THOSE 208 BOXES OVER 

203
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,107
FIVE YEARS, WE ESTIMATED AFTER 

204
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,976
DNA SAMPLING OF 400 INDIVIDUALS.

205
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:53,412
FROM THAT 200 WERE AMERICANS. 

206
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:54,614
THE LIKELIHOOD, YOU ARE 

207
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,151
CORRECT, THERE MAY BE SOME UN 

208
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,886
FORCES, THERE MAY BE SOME SOUTH 

209
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,521
KOREAN REMAINS AS WELL AS 

210
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,357
CHINESE AND NORTH KOREAN. 

211
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:06,192
OUR LABORATORIES BOTH DNA AND 

212
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,193
FORENSIC LABORATORY HAVE THE 

213
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:09,929
TECHNOLOGY AND THE CAPABILITIES 

214
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,363
BY WHICH TO DIFFERENTIATE THOSE 

215
00:07:11,363 --> 00:07:13,833
REMAINS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 

216
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,700
YEARS. 

217
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,137
>> I THINK YOU MENTIONED IN 

218
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:18,938
SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT NORTH 

219
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,173
KOREA ABOUT POTENTIAL FUTURE 

220
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,208
ACTIONS MAY BE TO SEARCH FOR 

221
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:29,749
MORE REMAINS AND JOINT EFFORTS. 

222
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,750
IF I AM TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT, 

223
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,218
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ENDED 

224
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,119
THE PROGRAM WHICH U. S. 

225
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,588
OFFICIALS WOULD BE HELPING TO 

226
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:36,956
SEARCH FOR REMAINS IN PART 

227
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,424
BECAUSE OF SECURITY CONCERNS OF 

228
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,592
THE FORCES. 

229
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:40,693
CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU ARE 

230
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:42,128
LOOKING FOR FROM THE NORTH THAT 

231
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,497
COULD RESUME THOSE OPERATIONS, 

232
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,433
JOINT OPERATIONS. 

233
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,402
AND HOW CLOSE ARE YOU TO AN 

234
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:49,836
AGREEMENT? 

235
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:55,107
>> WE OPERATED BETWEEN 1996 AND 

236
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:55,508
2005. 

237
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:56,509
OVERTIME WE CONDUCTED 33 JOINT 

238
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,777
ACTIVITIES WITH THE NORTH 

239
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,845
KOREANS. 

240
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,179
SECURITY IS PRIMARILY OUR 

241
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,046
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR 

242
00:08:01,046 --> 00:08:03,249
PERSONNEL. 

243
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,483
WE ALSO PAY ATTENTION TO 

244
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,052
COMMUNICATIONS, HAVING 

245
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,987
COMMUNICATION ABILITIES AS WELL 

246
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,156
AS THE ABILITY TO MEDEVAC OUR 

247
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,225
PERSONNEL SHOULD THEY GET HURT. 

248
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,527
WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR FROM 

249
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,162
THE NORTH KOREANS IS AGAIN, A 

250
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,329
COMMITMENT FROM THEM THAT 

251
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:18,998
COMMUNICATIONS, MEDICAL 

252
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,132
EVACUATION REQUIREMENTS CAN BE 

253
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:23,769
MET. MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT WE 

254
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,804
CAN CONDUCT THESE JOINT 

255
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,605
OPERATIONS IN A COLLABORATIVE 

256
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,474
WAY AS WE HAVE DONE FOR 10 

257
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,843
YEARS. 

258
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,578
IT ALL COMES DOWN BACK IN 2005 

259
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,147
THEIR BEHAVIOR ON THE 

260
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:35,748
INTERNATIONAL STAGE. 

261
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,817
THE PRESIDENT, RIGHTFULLY SO, 

262
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:40,553
WAS CONCERNED THAT THE NUCLEAR 

263
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,988
ACTIVITIES, MISSILE ACTIVITIES 

264
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,890
WERE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR 

265
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,459
JOINT OPERATIONS WHICH IS WHY 

266
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,260
WE SUSPENDED. 

267
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,832
>> IS THIS SPECIFICS ABOUT 

268
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,233
BEING IN THE FIELD THAT YOU ARE 

269
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:54,934
LOOKING AT? 

270
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,468
>> BOTH. 

271
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:58,771
SECRETARY POMPEO IN GETTINGTHE 

272
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,772
REAFFIRMATION FROM THE NORTH 

273
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,842
KOREANS LAST MONTH, AFFIRMED 

274
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:03,976
THAT THEY DO WANT TO ESTABLISH 

275
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,612
COMMUNICATIONS WITH US AND DO 

276
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,582
-- TO CONDUCT JOINT OPERATIONS. 

277
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,683
WE HAVE NOT STARTED THOSE 

278
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,884
NEGOTIATIONS BUT WE WILL DO SO. 

279
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,221
IT IS ON A SEPARATE TRACK. 

280
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,123
BUT IT COULD BE JOHN INTO THE 

281
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,525
GREATER GEOPOLITICAL STREAM. 

282
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,060
FOR NOW WE ARE TREATING IT AS A 

283
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,562
MILITARY, MILITARY CONTACT BUT 

284
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,763
MORE PARTLY AS A HUMANITARIAN 

285
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:32,805
ENDEAVOR THAT SUFFERED -- IS 

286
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:33,940
SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM ANY 

287
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,173
OTHER. 

288
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,041
THE 45 COUNTRIES THAT WE WORK 

289
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:36,542
WITH ALL RECOGNIZE THIS AS A 

290
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:37,209
HUMANITARIAN ENDEAVOR INCLUDING 

291
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:38,277
COUNTRIES LIKE RUSSIA AND CHINA 

292
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:39,111
WHERE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS 

293
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,413
COOPERATION WITH THEM. 

294
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,884
>> THANK YOU, SARAH. GENTLEMEN, 

295
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,118
THE RECENT DEATH OF FORMER 

296
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,088
CONGRESSMAN BILL HENMAN OF 

297
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,889
NORTH CAROLINA BROUGHT BACK A 

298
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:54,560
LOT OF THE REHASHING SERIOUS 

299
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,731
CHARGES THAT HE MADE THAT THOSE 

300
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:00,299
WHO WERE IN VIETNAM EITHER AS 

301
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,268
PRISONERS OR DEAD WERE NOT 

302
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:06,205
FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR. 

303
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:08,641
HAS THE BOOK FINALLY BEEN CLOSED

304
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,875
ON THOSE AMERICANS WHO SERVED 

305
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,343
IN VIETNAM AND WERE PRISONERS 

306
00:10:11,343 --> 00:10:13,579
OF WAR? 

307
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,481
>> IT HAS. 

308
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,416
RIGHT NOW THERE ARE CLOSE TO 

309
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:19,952
1700, 1600, THAT REMAIN MISSING 

310
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:24,123
AND UNACCOUNTED FOR. 

311
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,357
WITHIN THAT SET OF UNACCOUNTED 

312
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,459
FOR IS WHAT WE CALL LAST KNOWN 

313
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:26,692
ALIVE. 

314
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,295
IT IS A SMALL SUBSET OF 

315
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,829
INDIVIDUALS WHO, FOR WHATEVER 

316
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:33,532
REASON, WERE SEEN ALIVE AT A 

317
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,636
CERTAIN POINT DURING THE WAR AND

318
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,304
REMAIN UNACCOUNTED FOR. 

319
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,839
OUR PRIORITY WITH THE VIA MINIS 

320
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,074
IS TO GET AT THAT SMALL SUBSET. 

321
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,577
I THINK IT IS DOWN TO 25, NOT 

322
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:47,913
NECESSARILY PRISONERS OF WAR, 

323
00:10:47,913 --> 00:10:49,281
LAST KNOWN ALIVE AT THE TIME 

324
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,884
THAT THEY WERE SEEN. 

325
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,454
>> REAL QUICK, OTHER REMAINS IN 

326
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,957
THE 55 BOXES, CAN WE CONFIRM 

327
00:10:57,957 --> 00:10:59,625
THAT ALL OF THEM ARE HUMAN 

328
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,327
REMAINS? OR ARE WE QUESTIONING 

329
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,361
THAT? 

330
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:05,965
>> YES. WE DID A CURSORY 

331
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:08,701
INSPECTION OF THE REMAINS 

332
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:10,569
BEFORE WE LOADED THEM ONTO THE 

333
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,472
MILITARY AIRCRAFT JUST TO 

334
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:14,573
ENSURE THAT AT LEAST SOME OF 

335
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:17,309
WHAT WAS IN EACH BOX WAS HUMAN. 

336
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,378
WHEN WE GOT TO -- IN SOUTH 

337
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,213
KOREA WE SPENT TWO DAYS GOING 

338
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,150
THROUGH EVERY BOX IN DETAIL 

339
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,151
CONDUCTING WHAT WE CALLED A 

340
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,821
FIELD FORENSIC REVIEW. 

341
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,256
THE PURPOSE OF THAT REVIEW IS 

342
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,457
TO ENSURE THAT EVERY ITEM IS 

343
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,258
CONSISTENT WITH BEING HUMAN AND 

344
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,392
IF THERE WERE ANY ANIMAL 

345
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:35,761
REMAINS WE WOULD HAVE COMBED 

346
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,729
THEM OUT AT THAT POINT. 

347
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,831
AS IT WAS WE DID NOT FIND 

348
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,799
ANIMAL REMAINS. 

349
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,500
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW 

350
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,068
MANY PEOPLE WE ARE LOOKING AT? 

351
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:47,473
>> WE DO NOT. 

352
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,941
THERE IS A SCIENTIFIC PROCESS 

353
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,610
TO ESTIMATE THAT. 

354
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,745
I WISH IT WAS FAST BECAUSE I 

355
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,213
THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD 

356
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,014
LIKE TO KNOW, FAMILIES WOULD 

357
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,850
LOVE TO KNOW THAT INFORMATION. 

358
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,684
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS GOING TO 

359
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,120
TAKE MONTHS OF ANALYSIS TO 

360
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,721
START TO GET A REFINED 

361
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:02,988
ESTIMATE. 

362
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,857
>> ONE LAST QUESTION. 

363
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:09,795
>>DO YOU HAVE A TIMELINE FOR -- 

364
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,998
AND CAN YOU CHARACTERIZE WHAT 

365
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,333
IT WAS LIKE TO WORK WITH THE 

366
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,236
NORTH KOREANS ON THIS PROCESS. 

367
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,804
HAVE THEY BEEN WORKING WITH YOU 

368
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:19,839
IN GOOD FAITH? 

369
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,442
>>THE FIRST QUESTION IS WE ARE 

370
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:27,947
IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING OUR 

371
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,548
NEXT STEPS, SO WE CANNOT SAY WE 

372
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:31,484
HAVE A TIMELINE TODAY FOR 

373
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,184
BRINGING BACK MORE REMAINS. 

374
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:33,819
WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE 

375
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,187
IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE. 

376
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,556
I WILL SAY IN TERMS OF HAVING 

377
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:40,993
WORKED THERE, I WORKED THERE 

378
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,797
DURING THE 1996, 2005, I SPENT 

379
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,398
A LOT OF TIME IN THE FIELD AND 

380
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:52,571
I WENT INTO -- WITH OUR TEAM ON 

381
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,906
JULY 27 AND THERE WAS A 

382
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:54,607
DIFFERENT FEEL TO IT. 

383
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,176
IT WAS A MUCH MORE FRIENDLY, 

384
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,846
WELCOMING APPROACH THIS TIME 

385
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:03,783
COMPARED TO THE WAY IT USED TO 

386
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:12,858
BE. 

387
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:20,532
>> THANK YOU, DIRECTOR. 

388
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,767
LOOKING AHEAD TO NEXT WEEK, 

389
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,367
AMBASSADOR BOLTON WILL MEET 

390
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,602
WITH OFFICIALS IN ISRAEL AND 

391
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:24,970
UKRAINE AS WELL AS THE RUSSIA 

392
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,204
COUNTERPART IN GENEVA AS A 

393
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:30,009
FOLLOW-UP -- FOLLOW TO THE 

394
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,277
HELSINKI SUMMIT. LASTLY, WE

FAMILIES OF THOSE INJURED AND 

397
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,849
DECEASED AFTER THE TRAGIC 

398
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:39,518
BRIDGE COLLAPSE IN TO KNOW WHAT 

399
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:46,525
ITALY AS WELL AS THE VICTIMS 

400
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:47,559
FROM THE ATTACK IN LONDON. 

401
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,327
THE PRESIDENT CONDEMNS THIS 

402
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,161
ATTACK ON CIVILIANS AND STANDS 

403
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,028
READY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE. 

404
00:13:50,028 --> 00:13:51,629
>> WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE 

405
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:57,670
PRESIDENT VIA TWITTER ABOUT 

406
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,138
OMAROSA DESCRIBING HER AS 

407
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,372
CRAZED, A LOWLIFE, A DOG. 

408
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:02,741
IS THIS A WAY FOR A PRESIDENT 

409
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,911
TO TALK ABOUT ANY AMERICAN THAT 

410
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,914
HE HIRED AND MADE THE HIGHEST 

411
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:13,752
RANKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN? 

412
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:14,653
>> THE PRESIDENT IS CERTAINLY 

413
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,288
VOICING HIS FRUSTRATION WITH 

414
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,623
THE FACT THAT THIS PERSON HAS 

415
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:19,325
SHOWN A COMPLETE LACK OF 

416
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,392
INTEGRITY, PICK -- PARTICULARLY 

417
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,963
HER ACTIONS HERE AT THE WHITE 

418
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:24,230
HOUSE. 

419
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,597
>>WHY DID HE HIRE HER? 

420
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,599
>> THE PRESIDENT WANTED TO GIVE 

421
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,202
HER A CHANCE AND HE MADE CLEAR 

422
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,638
WHEN GENERAL KELLY CAME ON AND 

423
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:35,874
HE VOICED CONCERNS THAT THIS 

424
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:36,976
INDIVIDUAL DID NOT HAVE THE 

425
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:37,910
BEST INTEREST OF THE WHITE 

426
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,111
HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT AND THE 

427
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:41,380
COUNTRY AT HEART. 

428
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,614
THE PRESIDENT SAID DO WHAT YOU 

429
00:14:42,614 --> 00:14:43,816
CAN TO GET ALONG AND IF YOU 

430
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,852
CANNOT HE GAVE HIM FULL 

431
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:47,886
AUTHORITY TO CARRY OUT THE 

432
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:49,822
DECISION TO LET HIM GO. 

433
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,757
>>WHAT IS THE STRATEGY OF 

434
00:14:51,757 --> 00:14:53,425
CONTINUING TO RESPOND TO THIS. 

435
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:55,794
WHY DOES HE NOT IGNORE IT? 

436
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,030
>> LOOK, I THINK IT IS 

437
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,630
FRUSTRATIONS. 

438
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,865
NOT ONLY THOSE OF US HERE IN 

439
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,401
THE WHITE HOUSE BUT FRANKLY 

440
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,769
MOST OF AMERICA WOULD BE HAPPY 

441
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,704
TO IGNORE IT. 

442
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:06,304
UNFORTUNATELY INDIVIDUALS IN 

443
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:09,575
THIS ROOM CONTINUE TO CREATE A 

444
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,943
LARGE PLATFORM FOR SOMEBODY 

445
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,211
THEY KNOW NOT TO HAVE A LOT OF 

446
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,479
CREDIBILITY AND SOMEONE THEY 

447
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,114
FRANKLY REFUSED TO GIVE A 

448
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:16,381
PLATFORM TO WHEN THEY WORKED 

449
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,050
HERE. 

450
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,051
IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS INDIVIDUAL 

451
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,386
STARTED TO NEGATIVELY ATTACK 

452
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,387
THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS 

453
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,423
ADMINISTRATION AND TRY TO TEAR 

454
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,694
THIS ENTIRE PLACE DOWN THAT SHE 

455
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:29,528
RECEIVED THE TYPE OF PLATFORM 

456
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:31,864
AND ROLLOUT THAT SHE IS GETTING.

457
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,399
I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT IF 

458
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,967
EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS 

459
00:15:34,967 --> 00:15:36,835
ROOM AND EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN 

460
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,870
THE ADMINISTRATION NEVER HD TO 

461
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,238
TALK ABOUT THIS AGAIN AND WE 

462
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,239
GOT TO FOCUS ON THE REAL 

463
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:45,944
POLICIES AND THE THINGS THAT 

464
00:15:45,944 --> 00:15:46,945
MATTER NOT TO JUST PEOPLE IN 

465
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,913
THIS BUILDING BUT ALL 

466
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,547
AMERICANS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS, 

467
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,250
HISPANICS, EVERYONE IN BETWEEN. 

468
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,951
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST THING TO 

469
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:54,820
DO FOR OUR COUNTRY. 

470
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,555
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO CRITICS 

471
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:58,724
WHO SEE THE ATTACKS ON OMAROSA 

472
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,925
AS A PATTERN OF HIM ASSAULTING 

473
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:07,633
AFRICAN-AMERICANS -- HE HAS 

474
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,233
CLAIMED THAT FOOTBALL PLAYERS 

475
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,535
DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE 

476
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:10,302
PROTESTING. 

477
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:14,840
>>THE PRESIDENT HAS NOTHING TO 

478
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,943
DO WITH RACE. 

479
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:19,011
THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE 

480
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:19,978
PRESIDENT CALLING OUT SOMEONE'S 

481
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:20,412
LACK OF INTEGRITY. 

482
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,980
THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD ONLY 

483
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,882
POINT A FEW THINGS THAT THE 

484
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,117
PRESIDENT HAS SAID NEGATIVE 

485
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:27,419
ABOUT PEOPLE THAT ARE 

486
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,355
MINORITIES, THE FACT IS THE 

487
00:16:30,355 --> 00:16:31,690
PRESIDENT IS A EQUAL 

488
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,092
OPPORTUNITY PERSON THAT CALLS 

489
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,794
THINGS LIKE HE SEES IT. 

490
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,262
HE FIGHTS FIRE WITH FIRE AND HE 

491
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:38,430
DOES NOT HOLD BACK. 

492
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:42,667
SAME HAVE YOU SIGNED --? 

493
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:46,472
>> I AM NOT GOING TO GO BACK 

494
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:48,507
AND FORTH ON WHO HAS SIGNED -- 

495
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,508
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

496
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,710
I CAN TELL YOU IT IS COMMON FOR 

497
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,847
EMPLOYEES TO SIGN, PARTICULARLY 

498
00:16:54,847 --> 00:17:01,420
ANYONE WITH SECURITY CLEARANCE. 

499
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:09,560
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE 

500
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,864
KEPT OMAROSA ON DESPITE 

501
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,432
COMPLAINTS FROM COLLEAGUES 

502
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,500
BECAUSE SHE PERSONALLY 

503
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,170
SUPPORTED HIM -- 

504
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:18,770
>>I CANNOT HEAR YOU. 

505
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,972
>>HE SAID HE KEPT HER ON 

506
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,339
BECAUSE HE PERSONALLY SUPPORTED 

507
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,742
-- SHE PERSONALLY SUPPORTED 

508
00:17:23,742 --> 00:17:24,209
HIM. 

509
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,878
IS THAT TRUE OF ANY OTHER 

510
00:17:26,878 --> 00:17:31,784
OFFICIALS --. 

511
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,218
>>I AM NOT AWARE OF THAT. 

512
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,920
>> SINCE YOU DO NOT WANT TO 

513
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,421
TALK ABOUT OMAROSA I HAVE SOME 

514
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,757
OTHER --. 

515
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:41,760
DO YOU KNOW IF THE PRESIDENT 

516
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,632
WOULD CALL A BAN ON PRODUCTS 

517
00:17:47,632 --> 00:17:48,267
LIKE IPHONES? 

518
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:49,468
>> I DO NOT HAVE A POLICY 

519
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,469
ANNOUNCEMENT ON THAT FRONT. 

520
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,670
>>THERE WAS A REPORT FROM OUR 

521
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,105
COLLEAGUE THAT THE U. S. IS

AND POINT OUT THE CONCERNS THAT 

538

WE HAVE. 

539
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:31,677
>>ONE LAST ONE, DID THE 

540
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,277
PRESIDENT ENCOURAGE ISRAEL'S

GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE A TURKISH 

542
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,981
CITIZEN IN JULY AND DID THAT 

543
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:37,349
CONTRIBUTE TO HIS FRUSTRATION

WITH --? 

545
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,187
>> CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT HAS 

546
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,622
A GREAT DEAL OF FRUSTRATION ON 

547
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,323
THE FACT THAT PASTOR BRUNSON 

548
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:47,259
HAS NOT BEEN RELEASED AS WELL 

549
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:48,594
IS THE FACT THAT OTHER U. S.

WHITE HOUSE BELIEVE THAT IT IS 

555
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,011

VIOLATION BUT WE HAVE BEEN VERY 

562
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,786
CLEAR THAT NOT ONLY DO WE THINK 

563
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:15,821
THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT 

564
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,055

AFTER THE PRESIDENT -- ELECTION 

575

AFGHANISTAN OR IS THIS NEW 

596
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,236
OFFENSIVE GIVING HIM THE IDEA 

597
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,704
THAT A DIFFERENT APPROACH MIGHT 

598
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:39,004
BE NEEDED? 

599

WE FELT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS 

633
00:21:47,305 --> 00:21:48,740
WHAT HIS CRITICS CLAIM HIM TO 

634
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:49,941
BE, WE WOULD NOT BE HERE. 

635
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,176

00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:01,553
LOOK AT THE ECONOMY ALONE, THIS 

639
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,554
PRESIDENT SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE 

640
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:04,389

642
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,026

00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,395
AMERICANS THAT ARE WORKING NOW

00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:11,863
THAT WERE NOT WORKING WHEN THIS 

646
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:13,432
PRESIDENT TOOK PLACE. 

647
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,266
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA LEFT AFTER 

648
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:15,867
EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE, EIGHT 

649
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:26,010
YEARS HE CREATED 195,000 JOBS. 

650

PRESIDENT TRUMP IN HIS FIRST

00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,012
YEAR AND A HALF HAS ALREADY 

652
00:22:28,012 --> 00:22:28,780
TRIPLED WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA 

653
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,415
DID IN EIGHT YEARS AGO NOT ONLY 

654
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,616
DID HE DO THAT FOR AFRICAN-

655
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:32,216
AMERICANS BUT FOR HISPANICS. 

656
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:34,186
1.7 MILLION MORE HISPANICS ARE 

657
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:34,553

658
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:37,823
THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO CARES 

659
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,124
ABOUT AMERICANS AND IS COMMITTED

660
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,459

PUTTING POLICIES IN PLACE. 

662
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,799
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR YOU CANNOT 

663
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,901
GUARANTEE IT. 

664
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,536
>> I HAVE NOT BEEN IN EVERY 

665
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:51,937
SINGLE ROOM. 

666
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,104
I CAN TELL YOU THE PRESIDENT 

667
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:57,075
HAS ADDRESS THIS DIRECTLY AND HE

668
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,176
ADDRESSED IT TO THE AMERICAN

PEOPLE I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE 

670
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:01,012
FOCUS OF THE PRESIDENT IS, THAT

IS HELPING ALL AMERICANS. 

672
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:03,949
CERTAINLY THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO 

673
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,852
HAS BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR DECADES

674
00:23:06,852 --> 00:23:08,152
AND YOU ARE JUST NOW HEARING 

675
00:23:08,152 --> 00:23:09,521
úS 

676
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,223
ACCUSATIONS AFTER THE FACT THAT 

677
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,858
HE IS THAT WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER 

678
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:13,158
THE WORLD. 

679
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:15,093
IT WAS NOT UNTIL HE BECAME A 

680
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:15,693
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT THAT 

681
00:23:15,693 --> 00:23:17,128
YOU START TO HEAR SOME OF THESE 

682
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:21,166
SALACIOUS AND RIDICULOUS CLAIMS.

683
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,667
CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

684
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:23,834
ACTIONS THAT THIS PRESIDENT HAS 

685
00:23:23,834 --> 00:23:27,038
TAKEN, CERTAINLY THE POLICIES 

686
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:28,273
THAT HE HAS ENACTED, YOU CAN 

687
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:32,310
SEE THE HEART OF WHO HE IS AND 

688
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,645
YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT HE HAS 

689
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:35,113
DONE AND THE TYPE OF PRESIDENT 

690
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:35,881
AND PERSON HE IS. 

691
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,049
>> JUST A VERY QUICK ONE ON 

692
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:38,950
SOMETHING THAT OMAROSA SAID 

693
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,320
TODAY, SHE CALLED THE PRESIDENT 

694
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,422
MENTALLY UNFIT FOR THE OFFICE. 

695
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,223
AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED WITH HER, 

696
00:23:45,223 --> 00:23:46,758
HOW SURPRISED ARE YOU AT THE 

697
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,361
LEVEL OF HER ANIMUS TOWARD THIS 

698
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,162
PRESIDENT, TOWARD THIS WHITE 

699
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:51,863
HOUSE. 

700
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,366
>>CERTAINLY I THINK LIKE MOST 

701
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:58,203
PEOPLE WHO WORKED WITH HER WE 

702
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,371
ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT SHE 

703
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,238
WOULD GO TO SUCH A SELF-

704
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,472
SERVING, SOMEBODY WHO BLATANTLY 

705
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,642
CLEAR -- CARES MORE ABOUT 

706
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:07,145
HERSELF THAN THE COUNTRY TO 

707
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,112
MAKE UP SOME OF THESE 

708
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:08,814
OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS AND 

709
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:09,147
ACCUSATIONS. 

710
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,450
LOOK, SHE WORKED HERE FOR A YEAR

711
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,084
AND SHE DID NOT HAVE ANY OF 

712
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,486
THESE THINGS TO SAY. 

713
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,288
IN FACT EVERYTHING SHE SAID WAS 

714
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,491
QUITE THE OPPOSITE. NOT JUST 

715
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,692
THE YEAR THAT SHE WORKED HERE 

716
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,327
BUT THE TIME THAT SHE SPENT ON 

717
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:22,794
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. 

718
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,129
I THINK IT IS REALLY SAD WHAT 

719
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:24,963
SHE IS DOING. 

720
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,766
>>VERY QUICKLY I WANTED TO ASK 

721
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:29,968
YOU, WE READ EARLY THIS 

722
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,102
AFTERNOON THAT THE TRUMP 

723
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:35,740
CAMPAIGN HAS MADE AN úARBITRATI 

724
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,277
OMAROSA. I AM JUST CURIOUS AND 

725
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:42,647
I KNOW THERE ARE SEPARATE 

726
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,248
ENTITIES. 

727
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:44,282
IS THE WHITE HOUSE CONSIDERING 

728
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,051
PURSUING SOMETHING IN THE WAY 

729
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,285
OF POSSIBLE ACTION TOWARD 

730
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:47,786
OMAROSA? 

731
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,790
>> I CANNOT COMMENT ON ANY 

732
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,425
POTENTIAL ONGOING LEGAL MATTER. 

733
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,059
>> A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID ONE 

734
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:58,096
MOTIVE FOR OMAROSA WAS TO TEAR 

735
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:58,897
THIS ENTIRE PLACE DOWN. 

736
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:01,199
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? 

737
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,068
DO YOU OR OTHERS HAVE CONCERNS 

738
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,770
THAT WHILE SHE WAS HERE THAT 

739
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,471
SHE TAPED OTHER CONVERSATIONS 

740
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:11,443
THAT COULD BE DAMAGING TO THE 

741
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,577
WHITE HOUSE OR -- THAT YOU 

742
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:15,447
WOULD LIKE TO KEEP QUIET. 

743
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,681
>> I THINK THE GREATEST CONCERN 

744
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,983
THAT WE HAVE IS THE LACK OF 

745
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:18,450
INTEGRITY. 

746
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,719
>> SHE PLAYED A TAPE RECORDING 

747
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,120
OF THE CONVERSATION WITH THE 

748
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,390
PRESIDENT DO YOU HAVE ANY DOUBT 

749
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,758
THAT THAT WAS AUTHENTIC? 

750
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:27,425
>> I DON'T. 

751
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,960
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID THAT HE 

752
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,796
WAS UNAWARE AND THAT 

753
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:33,131
CONVERSATION, WAS THAT A TRUE 

754
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,699
REPRESENTATION OF WHAT HE KNEW 

755
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,267
AT THE TIME OR WAS HE TRYING TO 

756
00:25:36,267 --> 00:25:37,802
MAKE OMAROSA FEEL BETTER? 

757
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,504
>> AS I SAID MOMENTS AGO THE 

758
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:40,505
PRESIDENT HAD A DIRECT 

759
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:41,673
CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL KELLY 

760
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:48,647
AND ASKED HIM TO WORK THINGS 

761
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:48,880
OUT. 

762
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,215
IF THEY DIDN'T HE GAVE GENERAL 

763
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:50,982
KELLY THE FULL AUTHORITY TO 

764
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:51,950
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HIRING AND 

765
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,018
FIRING WITH RESPECT TO OMAROSA. 

766
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:54,351
>>HE KNEW HE APPROVED IT. 

767
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:58,522
>> ON THE TIMING I THINK HE 

768
00:25:58,522 --> 00:26:03,094
KNEW IT WAS A POSSIBILITY, AS 

769
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:04,195
TO THE FACT WHETHER OR NOT 

770
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,130
GENERAL KELLY HAD CALLED THE 

771
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,331
PRESIDENT I DON'T THINK HE HAD 

772
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:07,032
AT THAT POINT. 

773
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,900
>> REPEATEDLY WE HAD HEARD THE 

774
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,701
PRESIDENT DECLARE THE SO-CALLED 

775
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,769
ISLAMIC STATE -- HAS BEEN 

776
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:15,840
PRACTICALLY VANQUISHED IN IRAQ 

777
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,474
AND IN SYRIA. 

778
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:17,275
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 

779
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,443
YESTERDAY, THE LEAD INSPECTOR 

780
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:19,978
GENERAL FOR THE OPERATION SAYS 

781
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:22,814
THAT THEIR FORCES ARE ESTIMATED 

782
00:26:22,814 --> 00:26:26,651
TO BE BETWEEN ANYWHERE FROM 

783
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:31,589
28,600 AND -- FIGHTERS WHICH 

784
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,158
WOULD BE AT THE NUMBER THEY HAD 

785
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:33,558
AT THEIR PEAK. 

786
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,326
HAS ISIS BEEN VANQUISHED? 

787
00:26:35,326 --> 00:26:39,931
>> CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT -- 

788
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,232
HAS BEEN PRACTICALLY DESTROYED. 

789
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:46,104
CERTAINLY THERE CONTINUES TO BE 

790
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,338
ISIS FIGHTERS AND THAT IS WHY 

791
00:26:47,338 --> 00:26:49,007
WE CONTINUE TO TAKE ALL OF 

792
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:49,974
THOSE THREATS SERIOUSLY AND WE 

793
00:26:49,974 --> 00:26:51,376
LOOK FOR WAYS EVERY DAY TO 

794
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:52,210
DEFEAT THEM AND TO PROTECT 

795
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,211
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 

796
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:56,247
>> CAN I GO BACK TO THE RACE 

797
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:57,515
QUESTION AGAIN? 

798
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:00,051
I GET THAT YOU CAN CITE 

799
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,653
STATISTICS THAT MIGHT BE 

800
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:05,924
POSITIVE STATISTICS AND 

801
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:06,858
POLICIES THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

802
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,226
DONE FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND 

803
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:09,928
OTHER MINORITIES. 

804
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:11,429
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO 

805
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,897
LOOK AT THE PATTERN OF THE 

806
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:13,531
COMMENTS THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 

807
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,665
MADE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT AFRICAN-

808
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:18,269
AMERICANS AND WHO FEEL LIKE 

809
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,237
THEY ARE SINGLING THOSE FOLKS 

810
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:20,338
OUT BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE? 

811
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,675
ARE THEY MISSING SOMETHING? ARE 

812
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,309
THEY DELUDING THEMSELVES? 

813
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,445
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THEM? THERE 

814
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,114
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT 

815
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,349
THE PATTERN AND SAY YES, HE HAS 

816
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,250
SAID NEGATIVE THINGS ABOUT A 

817
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:36,321
LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT THERE SEEMS 

818
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,455
TO BE A PARTICULAR PATTERN OF 

819
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,257
SINGLING OUT AFRICAN-AMERICANS 

820
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,825
AND COMMENTING IN PARTICULAR 

821
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,425
ABOUT THEIR INTELLIGENCE AND 

822
00:27:41,425 --> 00:27:41,892
THEIR LACK THEREOF. 

823
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,027
>>I DO NOT THINK SO. 

824
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:47,699
I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID 

825
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:47,899
 

826
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,836
OF INDIVIDUALS CERTAINLY THAT 

827
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,104
ARE NOT AFRICAN-AMERICAN OR ANY 

828
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,774
OTHER MINORITY. I CAN SIMPLY 

829
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,343
TALK TO ABOUT THE POLICY AND 

830
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,844
THE PERSON THAT THE PRESIDENT 

831
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,112
IS. 

832
00:28:01,112 --> 00:28:08,119
I THINK, AGAIN, IF THE PRESIDENT

833
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,021
IS WHO HIS CRITICS SAY HE IS HE 

834
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,689
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS 

835
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:12,690
FOR DECADES. 

836
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,892
HE CERTAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD 

837
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:14,726
BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON ATTEND 

838
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,693
HIS WEDDING. 

839
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,462
A NUMBER HAVE BIG FOR HIS 

840
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,363
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. 

841
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:23,868
IF THEY -- HE WAS WHO THEY SAY 

842
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,470
HE IS THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD 

843
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,104
RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM. 

844
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:27,572
I THINK IT IS CONVENIENT THAT 

845
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,139
ONCE THE PRESIDENT BECAME 

846
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,307
SOMEONE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, HE 

847
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:32,243
HAS SHOWN TIME AND TIME AGAIN 

848
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:33,178
THROUGH HIS ACTIONS AND 

849
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,179
POLICIES HE WANTS TO BE A 

850
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,613
PRESIDENT FOR ALL AMERICANS, HE 

851
00:28:35,613 --> 00:28:36,648
WANTS TO DO EVERYTHING HE CAN 

852
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,983
TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER, NOT 

853
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,285
JUST FOR A CERTAIN GROUP OF 

854
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:42,954
PEOPLE BUT FOR EVERYBODY. 

855
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,856
I THINK HE HAS MADE A NUMBER OF 

856
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,057
COMMENTS ABOUT PLENTY OF PEOPLE 

857
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,625
AND TO TRY TO SINGLE THAT OUT 

858
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,160
TO ONE GROUP IS SILLY. 

859
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,795
I THINK THE COMPARISONS 

860
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,698
PROBABLY HAVE MORE NASTY THINGS 

861
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,598
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. 

862
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:59,370
>> THE PRESIDENT IS SOMEBODY 

863
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,872
WHO IS GOING TO FIGHT FIRE WITH 

864
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:01,072
FIRE. 

865
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,640
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 

866
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,744
NEW AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT 

867
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,778
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNEW WHEN 

868
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:07,912
THEY VOTED FOR HIM AND THEY 

869
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,048
ELECTED HIM TO BE THE PRESIDENT.

870
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,649
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE HE HAS 

871
00:29:11,649 --> 00:29:13,551
GOVERNED IN A WAY THAT HAS 

872
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:21,526
HELPED ALL AMERICANS. 

873
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,961
FRANKLY IF WE WANT TO LOOK AT 

874
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:23,795
WHO IS CREATING DIVISIONS, I 

875
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,096
THINK THE MEDIA HAS DONE MORE 

876
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,297
TO DIVIDE THIS COUNTRY FAR MORE 

877
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:27,232
THAN THE PRESIDENT EVER HAS 

878
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,233
ELEVATING PEOPLE LIKE THE 

879
00:29:28,233 --> 00:29:29,167
AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK, BY 

880
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,771
FOCUSING ON SPARSELY ATTENDING 

881
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:36,341
A RALLY INSTEAD OF ALL OF THE 

882
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:36,741
POLICIES THAT THE 

883
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:37,542
ADMINISTRATION AND THE 

884
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:38,776
PRESIDENT ARE ENACTING AND ARE 

885
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:41,846
HELPING NOT JUST THE ECONOMY 

886
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,882
BUT ON SCHOOL CHOICE AND PRISON 

887
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:48,353
REFORM THIS IS A PRESIDENT WHO 

888
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:49,354
IS GOVERNING TO HELP ALL 

889
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:50,688
AMERICANS AND I THINK WE WILL 

890
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:52,457
BE BETTER OFF TO GIVE THAT MORE 

891
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,459
ATTENTION. 

892
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,128
>> CAN YOU EXPRESS HOW YOU FEEL 

893
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:04,803
ABOUT OMAROSA? -- DID SHE PULL 

894
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,172
HER OWN WEIGHT? WHAT SHE VIEWED 

895
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,508
AS UNTRUSTWORTHY? DID YOU TRUST 

896
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:13,711
HER? 

897
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,380
I AM TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF 

898
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,481
WHETHER YOUR VIEW OF HER HAS 

899
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,049
CHANGED WITH THE PUBLICATION OF 

900
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:18,349
THIS BOOK? 

901
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:21,052
>>I HAVE EXPRESSED 

902
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:21,452
DISAPPOINTMENT. 

903
00:30:21,452 --> 00:30:23,454
I AM NOT GOING TO GET INTO BACK 

904
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,957
AND FORTH. I THINK THAT THE 

905
00:30:26,957 --> 00:30:29,594
FOCUS NOT ONLY OF MY TIME HERE 

906
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:31,763
BUT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS 

907
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:37,001
LOOKING FORWARD AND HOW WE CAN 

908
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,601
ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT POLICIES 

909
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:39,036
THAT MATTER TO THE AMERICAN 

910
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:44,208
PEOPLE. 

911
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:49,647
>> WHEN THE FIRST TIME THE 

912
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,615
MUELLER INVESTIGATION INDICTED 

913
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:57,521
AMERICANS THIS ADMINISTRATION 

914
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:58,423
SANCTIONED THOSE, THE 12 THAT 

915
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,624
WAS RECENTLY INDICTED, THE 12 

916
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:00,458
RUSSIAN NATIONALS, THIS IS A 

917
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,659
MINISTRATION PLAN TO LEVEL 

918
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,760
SANCTIONS AGAINST THEM? 

919
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,129
>> I DO NOT HAVE ANY 

920
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,865
ANNOUNCEMENT ON THAT. 

921
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:11,502
>>YOU SAID YOU WOULD LIKE 

922
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:12,403
EVERYONE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT 

923
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,404
THIS SUBJECT INCLUDING THE 

924
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,038
ADMINISTRATION, ARE YOU SAYING 

925
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,340
YOU WOULD LIKE THE PRESIDENT TO 

926
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,110
STOP TWEETING ABOUT OMAROSA? 

927
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,144
>> I THINK IF THE MEDIA 

928
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,512
CONTINUES TO GIVE IT WALL-TO-

929
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:22,080
WALL COVERAGE, THE 

930
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,781
ADMINISTRATION WILL BE FORCED 

931
00:31:23,781 --> 00:31:26,484
TO RESPOND. 

932
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:27,986
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER OFF 

933
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,420
FOR ALL OF US TO WALK AWAY AND 

934
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,156
FOCUS ON THINGS THAT MATTER. 

935
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:36,961
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT --. 

936
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:40,631
HOW MUCH DOES THIS HAVE TO DO 

937
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:44,135
WITH COUNTERING THE GROWING 

938
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,670
PRESENCE OF CHINA IN THE 

939
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,372
REGION? 

940
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,107
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF SHARED 

941
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,008
VALUES WITH THE COUNTRIES THAT 

942
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,109
HE HAS VISITED. 

943
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,844
WE WOULD ALWAYS LIKE TO BE THE 

944
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:54,012
PRIORITY PARTNER FOR THOSE 

945
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:58,049
COUNTRIES AND WE HOPE THAT 

946
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:58,683
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WILL 

947
00:31:58,683 --> 00:31:59,884
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND WE WILL 

948
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:00,385
KEEP YOU POSTED. 

949
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:02,086
>>LAST QUESTION. 

950
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,956
>>THE CHUM CAMPAIGN 

951
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:06,124
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY ARE 

952
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:09,527
PURSUING ARBITRATION WITH 

953
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,661
OMAROSA NECESSITATES ATTENTION 

954
00:32:10,661 --> 00:32:13,998
AND A MAJOR NATIONAL FOCUS. 

955
00:32:13,998 --> 00:32:15,800
CAN I ASK ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF 

956
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,670
SIGNING NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS

957
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,072
. LET ME ASK YOU WHAT IT SAYS 

958
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:21,973
ABOUT THE EXPRESSIONS OF 

959
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,308
LOYALTY OR LACK THERE OF, 

960
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:25,776
PEOPLE WHO WORK BEHIND THAT 

961
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:27,679
WALL? 

962
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,013
WHY DO PEOPLE NEED TO BE 

963
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:29,914
CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED FOREVER 

964
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:34,018
AFTER AND NEVER SAY ANYTHING 

965
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:34,819
NEGATIVE ABOUT THE PRESIDENT, 

966
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,954
ANY MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY, ANY 

967
00:32:36,954 --> 00:32:37,120
--. 

968
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,256
WHY IS IT NECESSARY? 

969
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,456
>> IT IS COMMON. 

970
00:32:39,456 --> 00:32:42,159
>> FOR CORPORATIONS PROTECTING 

971
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,594
CORPORATE 

972
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:47,799
>> DESPITE CONTRARY OPINION IT 

973
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,169
IS ACTUALLY VERY NORMAL AND 

974
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:52,803
EVERY ADMINISTRATION PRIOR TO 

975
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,338
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS 

976
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:57,308
HAD AN DAS SPECIFICALLY FOR 

977
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,176
ANYONE WHO HAD SECURITY 

978
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:03,781
CLEARANCE. 

979
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:08,920
>> RIGHT NOW WHAT THE CHUM 

980
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,991
CAMPAIGN IS DOING IS FORCING HER

981
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,925
TO DEFEND HERSELF AND 

982
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:14,525
POTENTIALLY DO DAMAGE. 

983
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,893
WHY IS THAT NECESSARY? 

984
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,762
>> THAT IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE 

985
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:18,696
TO ASK THE CHUM CAMPAIGN. 

986
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,364
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I 

987
00:33:20,364 --> 00:33:32,276
CAN ANSWER. 

988
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,177
>> WE WERE LISTENING TO WHITE 

989
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,011
HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH 

990
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:34,579
HUCKABEE SANDERS. 

991
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:36,447
SHE ANSWERED A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

992
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:42,553
ABOUT OMAROSA MANIGAULT NEWMAN'S

993
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:43,654
ALLEGATIONS ABOUT LIFE INSIDE 

994
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,789
THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE SHE WAS 

995
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:45,589
ASKED IF SHE COULD GUARANTEE 

996
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:46,424
WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 

997
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:50,995
EVER SAID THE N-WORD  OR IF A 

998
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:52,596
TAPE EXISTED WHERE HE IS SAYING 

999
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:55,866
THE N-WORD. 

1000
00:33:55,866 --> 00:33:56,968
SHE SAID SHE COULD NOT 

1001
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:57,902
GUARANTEE THAT BUT SHE ANSWERED 

1002
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,037
REPORTERS THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1003
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,871
HIMSELF  ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE. 

1004
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,373
SHE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT THE 

1005
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:07,411
NDA , THE NONDISCLOSURE 

1006
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,112
AGREEMENTS THAT THE MEMBERS OF 

1007
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,480
THE WHITE HOUSE ARE EXPECTED TO 

1008
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:09,679
SIGN. 

1009
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,282
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CBS CHIEF 

1010
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,650
WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MAJOR 

1011
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,152
GARRETT WHO WAS AT THE BRIEFING 

1012
00:34:15,152 --> 00:34:19,623
AND HE COULD TELL US MORE. 

1013
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:20,358
MAJOR, WE HEARD SARAH HUCKABEE 

1014
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,858
SANDERS SAY THAT THE PRESIDENT 

1015
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:23,594
IS EXPRESSING HIS FRUSTRATION 

1016
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,730
WITH OMAROSA BY CALLING HER A 

1017
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,431
DOG AND NOW SHE MAY BE FACING 

1018
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:29,065
LEGAL ACTION FROM THE WHITE 

1019
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:29,299
HOUSE. 

1020
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,302
DOES THIS WHITE HOUSE VIEW THIS 

1021
00:34:31,302 --> 00:34:33,270
DRAMA OVER HER TELL ALL AS A 

1022
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,739
DISTRACTION OR IS THERE REAL 

1023
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,308
CONCERN THAT THIS COULD CAUSE 

1024
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:40,777
MAJOR PROBLEMS? 

1025
00:34:40,777 --> 00:34:43,380
>> CLEARLY THERE IS CONCERN, 

1026
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,916
CLEARLY THE CREATION OF TAPE 

1027
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:50,788
RECORDINGS AND THE PUBLICATION 

1028
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:51,722
IN THE BOOK OR MEDIA 

1029
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:52,422
APPEARANCES AND THE SUGGESTION 

1030
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:53,824
THAT SHE HAS MADE PUBLICLY THAT 

1031
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,690
THERE ARE MORE TAPE RECORDINGS, 

1032
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,092
SHE WILL WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY 

1033
00:34:56,092 --> 00:34:59,730
SHE WILL RELEASE, IT IS CLEARLY 

1034
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,865
A TOPIC OF INTERNAL CONCERN 

1035
00:35:00,865 --> 00:35:01,866
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1036
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,367
I ASKED SARAH SANDERS ABOUT 

1037
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:07,238
THAT DIRECTLY AND SHE KIND OF 

1038
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:07,838
GLOSSED OVER THAT. 

1039
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:09,540
I KNOW THAT IT IS AN ONGOING 

1040
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,709
CONCERN. 

1041
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:12,810
A COUPLE OF THINGS TO LAYOUT 

1042
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,011
FOR THE AUDIENCE, THE WHITE 

1043
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,279
HOUSE HAS TAKEN NO LEGAL ACTION 

1044
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:15,880
AS OF YET. 

1045
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,614
THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1046
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,849
THE CHUM CAMPAIGN OR THE TRUMP 

1047
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:19,917
ORGANIZATION, I AM TRIED TO 

1048
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:22,086
FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE HAS, LET'S 

1049
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:23,187
SAY FOR SAKE OF ARGUMENT THE 

1050
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:25,022
CHUM CAMPAIGN HAS SOUGHT AN 

1051
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:25,990
ARBITRATION INTO INTERVENTION, 

1052
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,860
THAT IS NOT FEDERAL OR STATE 

1053
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,961
COURT, THAT IS ARBITRATION 

1054
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:31,829
PANEL. 

1055
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,264
AS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT I 

1056
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,866

AGREEMENTS THE WAY THAT THEY 

1060
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,808
ARE COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE 

1061
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,145
PRIVATE SECTOR, THEY HAVE BEEN 

1062
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,713
DESCRIBED TO ME AS A NON-

1063
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:54,185
DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT. IF YOU 

1064
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,319
LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE AND YOU 

1065
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,020
LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE 

1066
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,455
YOU DO NOT SAY ANYTHING FOR THE 

1067
00:35:57,455 --> 00:35:58,656
REST OF YOUR LIFE ABOUT THE 

1068
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,657
PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT THE 

1069
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,493
FAMILY OR YOUR TIME THERE. 

1070
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,961
I HAVE ALSO BEEN TOLD BY THOSE 

1071
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:04,862
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE 

1072
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:05,429
DRAFTING OF THE NON-

1073
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,264
DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT IS THAT 

1074
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:07,999
THEY ARE NOT LEGALLY 

1075
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,332
ENFORCEABLE. 

1076
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,367
THEY ARE NOT. 

1077
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,134
THE PRESIDENT WANTED SOMETHING 

1078
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,135
DRAFTED AND WANTED PEOPLE TO 

1079
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,971
SIGN IT TO CREATE AN INTERNAL 

1080
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,741
OATH OF SOLIDARITY AND 

1081
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:23,247
TRUSTWORTHINESS GOING FORWARD. 

1082
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:23,881
THEY ARE NOT NONDISCLOSURE 

1083
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,949
AGREEMENTS THE WAY THEY ARE 

1084
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,850
COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD IN THE 

1085
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,251
LEGAL AND PRIVATE SECTOR 

1086
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:27,818
CIRCLES, NON-DISPARAGEMENT 

1087
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:30,454
AGREEMENT AND THOSE WHO I SPOKE 

1088
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,656
TO WHO ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 

1089
00:36:31,656 --> 00:36:33,591
THE DRAFTING AND ASSIGNING, 

1090
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:34,592
THEY ARE PROBABLY, THIS IS THE 

1091
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,793
ADVICE THE PRESIDENT WAS GIVEN, 

1092
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:39,964
NOT LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE. 

1093
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:40,998
THAT LAYS DOWN SOME ASPECTS 

1094
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:41,932
ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE 

1095
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:43,334
WILL HAVE TODAY AND I SUSPECT 

1096
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,437
FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS ABOUT 

1097
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:47,571
WHAT HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN SIGNED 

1098
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,072
HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 

1099
00:36:49,072 --> 00:36:58,549
>> I AM CERTAIN THIS WILL NOT 

1100
00:36:58,549 --> 00:36:59,784
BE THE LAST WE HEAR ABOUT THIS 

1101
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,018
BECAUSE SOME POINTED OUT THAT 

1102
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:01,485
THE PRESIDENT BEARS 

1103
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,052
RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIRING 

1104
00:37:02,052 --> 00:37:03,354
SOMEONE WHO HE NOW DESCRIBES AS 

1105
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:04,455
WACKY AND DERANGED AND BY THE 

1106
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,090
WAY A DOG WHICH HE CLAIMS WAS 

1107
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,526
NOT IN ANY WAY A RACIAL EPITHET.

1108
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,194
DOES THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE A 

1109
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,797
RESPONSE TO THE LANGUAGE THAT 

1110
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,165
HE IS USING AND THE 

1111
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:19,270
RESPONSIBILITY THAT THIS GIVES? 

1112
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,271
>> ACCORDING TO SARAH SANDERS 

1113
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,606
HE IS AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND 

1114
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,707
SALTER HE WILL FIRE BACK AND 

1115
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:23,541
FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. 

1116
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,543
I DON'T BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT 

1117
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:26,877
-- OMAROSA CALL THE PRESIDENT A 

1118
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:31,048
DOG SHE CALLED HIM A RACIST AND 

1119
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,083
-- AND YOU CAN PICK YOUR 

1120
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,618
TERMINOLOGY AND DECIDE HOW 

1121
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:34,952
INSULTING OR OFFENSIVE THOSE 

1122
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,388
WORDS ARE. 

1123
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,189
AS THE PRESIDENT SAID ON 

1124
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,792
TWITTER YESTERDAY IT IS NOT 

1125
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:42,426
PRESIDENTIAL TO DO THIS, THAT 

1126
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,697
IS PUTTING IT MILDLY. 

1127
00:37:46,697 --> 00:37:47,431
THE PRESIDENT IS QUITE 

1128
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,532
COMFORTABLE, AS A MATTER OF 

1129
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:49,467
FACT, HE DELIGHTS IN BREAKING 

1130
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,001
CONVENTION ABOUT WHAT IS OR IS 

1131
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,070
NOT PRESIDENTIAL SPECIFICALLY 

1132
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,038
ON TWITTER. 

1133
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,041
AS TO WHY OMAROSA WAS HIRED I 

1134
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,175
THINK THE PRESIDENT MADE IT 

1135
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,076
CLEAR YESTERDAY, SHE SAID GREAT 

1136
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:02,747
THINGS ABOUT ME. 

1137
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,282
I KNEW AT THE TIME MANY PEOPLE 

1138
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,449
AT THE WHITE HOUSE WERE 

1139
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,218
FRUSTRATED WITH OMAROSA AND DID 

1140
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,052
NOT THINK SHE BROUGHT ANYTHING 

1141
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:10,321
TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF 

1142
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:10,788
POLICY, MUNICATION OR 

1143
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,956
LEGISLATIVE STRATEGY, YET SHE 

1144
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,224
WAS HERE BECAUSE SHE HAD A LONG-

1145
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,760
STANDING AND PRE-EXISTING 

1146
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,763
FRIENDSHIP AND DIRECT ACCESS TO 

1147
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,332
THE PRESIDENT. 

1148
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,666
WHEN YOU ENJOY THAT KIND OF 

1149
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:24,702
ACCESS AND THAT KIND OF HISTORY,

1150
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:25,770
PARTICULARLY IN THE TRUMP WHITE 

1151
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,204
HOUSE YOU GET TO STAY AROUND. 

1152
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,140
MY QUESTION TO SARAH SANDERS WAS

1153
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,777
, WAS THE PRESIDENT AWARE AND 

1154
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,412
DID HE AND POWER CHIEF OF STAFF 

1155
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,880
JOHN KELLY TO FIRE OMAROSA. 

1156
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,283
HE IN FACT DID. 

1157
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:39,950
I ASKED WHAT ABOUT THE 

1158
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,887
CONVERSATION THAT OMAROSA HAS 

1159
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,288
PLAYED FOR THE WORLD TO HEAR IT 

1160
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:45,222
SOUNDS LIKE THE PRESIDENT WAS 

1161
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:45,522
SURPRISED. 

1162
00:38:45,522 --> 00:38:47,057
WAS HE JUST MAKING HER FEEL 

1163
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:49,160
BETTER? 

1164
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,960
SARAH SANDERS SAID SOMETHING 

1165
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,295
THAT ADDS A LITTLE CONTEXT OF 

1166
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:51,795
THAT CONVERSATION, THE 

1167
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:52,930
PRESIDENT WAS NOT AWARE OF IT 

1168
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,331
AT THAT TIME AND AUTHORIZE 

1169
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:57,001
KELLY TO FIRE HER BUT HE HAD 

1170
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,036
NOT BEEN READ IN ON IT YET. 

1171
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,871
THAT CONVERSATION CAN BE VIEWED 

1172
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:03,040
WITH THAT SLIGHT ADDITION AND 

1173
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,041
CONTEXT AND INFORMATION. 

1174
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:08,546
>> A LITTLE EXTRA COLOR. 

1175
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,181
MAJOR, I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE 

1176
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,782
START OF THE BRIEFING. 

1177
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:13,450
AT SOME POINT DEFENSE OFFICIALS 

1178
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,552
GAVE AN UPDATE ON THE 

1179
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,786
IDENTIFICATION OF KOREAN WAR 

1180
00:39:15,786 --> 00:39:18,122
REMAINS THAT WERE RECENTLY 

1181
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,557
RETURNED TO THE U. S. WHAT DID 

1182
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:20,558
WE LEARN ABOUT THOSE? 

1183
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,094
>> A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS,

1184
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:24,628
ALL OF THE REMAINS PROVIDED ARE 

1185
00:39:24,628 --> 00:39:25,329
IN FACT HUMAN. 

1186
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,164
THEY DID FORENSIC TEST IN SOUTH 

1187
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,033
KOREA AFTER GETTING OUT OF 

1188
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,235
NORTH KOREA. 

1189
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,536
THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW MANY HUMAN 

1190
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,571
REMAINS ARE INVOLVED. 

1191
00:39:33,571 --> 00:39:36,774
THEY SAID THEY ARE NOT IN THE 

1192
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,309
MINDSET THAT IT IS ONE SET OF 

1193
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:39,310
HUMAN REMAINS FOR EACH BOX. 

1194
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,644
THERE ARE 55 BOXES THERE COULD 

1195
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,645
BE MORE OR LESS. 

1196
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:42,913
THEY ALSO DESCRIBED WHAT THEY 

1197
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,216
RECEIVED AS BEING IN CONDITION 

1198
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:50,020
OF MODERATE TO POOR. 

1199
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,122
I THINK THEY WERE TELLING THE 

1200
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,256
COUNTRY THERE WILL BE A GOOD 

1201
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,391
LONG SPACE OF TIME THAT WILL BE 

1202
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:55,592
NECESSARY TO DO THE FORENSIC 

1203
00:39:55,592 --> 00:39:59,764
ANALYSIS, DO DNA TESTING, MATCH 

1204
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,365
THOSE WITH EXISTING DNA 

1205
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:02,899
DATABASES AND FIND AND VERIFY 

1206
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:07,605
COMMONALITIES TO CONFIRM WHO 

1207
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:11,909
THESE PEOPLE ARE. THERE IS ALSO 

1208
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,544
THE QUESTION OF ARE THEY ALL 

1209
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:13,944
AMERICAN REMAINS? 

1210
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:15,079
OF COURSE THE KOREAN WAR WAS 

1211
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,615
FOUGHT UNER THE UNITED NATIONS

1212
00:40:17,615 --> 00:40:22,119
, MANY COUNTRIES PARTICIPATED, 

1213
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:22,920
THE PRINCIPAL COMBATANTS WERE 

1214
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,888
CHINESE, NORTH KOREAN, SOUTH 

1215
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:24,355
KOREAN AND AMERICAN. 

1216
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:27,691
THERE COULD BE OTHER 

1217
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,191
NATIONALITIES INVOLVED. 

1218
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,093
THAT IS OTHER FORENSIC WORK 

1219
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:35,933
THAT NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED. 

1220
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,134
THE OTHER THING THAT WE LEARNED 

1221
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,569
IS THAT THEY ARE NOT AT A 

1222
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,737
STANDSTILL BUT THEY HAVE A LONG 

1223
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:40,971
PROCESS TO GO THROUGH FOR THE 

1224
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:42,373
NEXT ROUND OF REMAINS TO LET U. 

1225
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,407
S. PERSONNEL BACK INTO NORTH 

1226
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,109
KOREA, TO SEARCH FOR OTHER 

1227
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,176
REMAINS, THERE IS CONVERSATIONS 

1228
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:49,313
ABOUT THAT. 

1229
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:50,147
THEY DO NOT APPEAR AND 

1230
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,782
CERTAINLY THE WORD SPOKEN HERE 

1231
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,183
AT THE PODIUM DID NOT CONVEY 

1232
00:40:53,183 --> 00:40:54,652
THAT ANYTHING WILL BE ACHIEVED 

1233
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:55,919
ON THOSE FRONTS IN THE NEAR-

1234
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:56,119
TERM. 

1235
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,988
THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG, 

1236
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:01,025
LONG PROCESS. 

1237
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,159
IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THE 

1238
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,727
GENTLEMAN UP HERE SAID THAT SO 

1239
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,828
FAR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE NORTH 

1240
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:06,330
KOREANS HAS BEEN POSITIVE AND 

1241
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,599
COLLEGIAL AND THEY ARE HOPEFUL 

1242
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:11,168
THAT SPIRIT OF COOPERATION AND 

1243
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,269
THE OBTAINING OF MORE PHYSICAL 

1244
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:14,204
REMAINS CAN BE ACHIEVED. 

1245
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:20,377
>> MAJOR GARRETT, THANK YOU. 

1246
00:41:20,377 --> 00:00:00,000
>>> WE WILL TAKE A QUICK BREAK.
