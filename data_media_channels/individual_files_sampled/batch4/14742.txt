hey Ontario will there be a Ford in your future maybe yes perhaps no but fasten your seat belts nevertheless we're all going to go on a five coupon ride as Doug Ford has announced he plans to run for the leadership of the beleaguered PC Party of Ontario well what a difference a week makes just days ago patch of brown was PC leader the cover boy of the PC party's people's promise manifesto then an alleged sex scandal emerges and since we're living in this day and age of post Harvey Weinstein well Brown went down faster than a two-ton anchor in quicksand to fill the void a lineup of the usual suspects are bandied around to vie for the leadership in March Vic Fedeli Kristen Elliott rod Phillips Carolyn Mulroney and then like a bull in a proverbial china shop along comes Doug Ford right now the party needs strong leadership someone who's ready to clean up the mess and lead us into the June election this is why today I'm announcing I'll be running for the leader of the Ontario PC Party and to be the next premier of this great province now in channeling his dearly departed brother Rob Doug Ford is going after the elites and promising a commitment to fiscal responsibility sadly we reside in the province with plenty of the former and a dearth of the latter and Ford hits the bullseye when he says he is horrific Lee watched as the PC party falls into complete disarray devolve into a party that treats real conservatives with contempt be they social conservatives or fiscal conservatives or democratic conservatives a PC party that time and time again ignores its grassroots members in terms of the nomination process a PC party that has been infiltrated by ex Liberals that is now something way too progressive when it needs to be farm a conservative a PC party that seemingly makes up the rules as it goes along for example when a matter has to be upheld in the party's favor well the executive points to its constitution noting that its hands are tied but when the executive violates the Constitution well those hard and fast constitutional rules are merely guidelines as they say in Vegas the fix is in but the hypocrisy is still hard to take so into the swamp Wade's Doug Ford who represents the considerable base and the obvious question is what are his chances of becoming leader well in the days ahead the first potential Screwjob the PC Party might embrace is concocting a set of rules that would actually preclude Ford from running for leader if they do that they will only prove that Ford is right when he says the elites have indeed taken over the party another hurdle fordable face will be the media party of course I mean just look at the coverage of Ford's announcement by the immediate leads and the Twitterverse Robin Doolittle with The Globe and Mail tweeted Doug Ford brother of the late Rob Ford announced his bid to become the next Ontario PC leader at a press conference held in his mother's basement other observers hearkened on the mother's basement line as well such as Toronto Mayor John Torres former spokeswoman Amanda Galbraith who stated I'm really really sad I miss Doug Ford's press conference in his mom's basement nothing says ready to lead the province of Ontario like a press conference in your mom's basement you see what's going on here I mean already they're depicting Ford as a loser as opposed to an accomplished entrepreneur you know someone who lurks in his mom's basement presumably playing xbox all day so the tar and feathering has already begun I'm sure the Toronto Star is already recalling Daniel Dale from Washington so we can haunt a vacant lot behind Doug's backyard just as Dale did with Rob Ford others are saying Ford is only going to damage the PC brand by making the leadership contest contentious and the missive when was the time for PCs to pull together and not rock the boat well I'm calling bullshit on that one the PC party does not need someone abiding by the rules of Queensbury and maintaining the awful status quo no it needs a street fighter like Doug and here's why this party has lost its way it has been completely co-opted by so many ex liberals that from the carbon tax to the sex ed curriculum to the green energy strategy can anyone find a single profound policy difference that separates the PCs from the liberals I sure can't bottom line if Doug Ford stays true to his fiscal conservative beliefs he will appeal to an untold number of conservatives who feel that the PC Party has abandoned them yes Doug Ford might be an early longshot but you saw Rob Ford becoming mayor of Toronto nobody imagined brexit being endorsed and so many believed right up until election night that Donald Trump would never be President secondly even if Ford is unsuccessful in his bid for leader and causes a path a PC party internal destruction in his wake I'm fine with that too because I'd rather subscribe to a scorched earth policy then live in a delusional State upon infected rancid earth and with a PC party being run by ex liberals beholden to a liberal agenda that is indeed the elitist status quo liberal light dragon Doug Ford will be trying to slay for the rebel dawn media I'm David the men's ID Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a rebel premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
