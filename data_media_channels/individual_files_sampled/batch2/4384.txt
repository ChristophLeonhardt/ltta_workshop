I think one-year anniversary as White House chief of staff it comes up with July 31st actually when the judge is about to leave Anthony Kennedy same date but according to a new Wall Street Journal report on the front page today General Kelly may be out not be able to make his own deadline this report says that President Trump is now openly consulting advisor dancing them about who to replace Kelly with one person close to the White House said mr. Kelly doesn't believe he can serve mr. Trump well because the president stopped listening to him well this person said mr. Kelly no longer likes the job and doesn't believe the president genuinely wants a chief of staff well the report in the journal adds that the top two choices to replace the general our vice president Pence's chief of staff Nick Ayers and OMB director Mick Mulvaney whether they'll have better luck restraining Trump's mercurial instincts than a retired four-star general is an open question well back at a plan b c news report that kelly was likely to leave by July 31st noting that Kelly had repeatedly are reportedly referred to trump as an idiot the other guy called him a moron you got to keep that straight I'm joined right now by the hardball rounds a 22 Kumar White House correspondent Mike Lachi for Rutgers the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post and CEO kapoor national political reporter for bloomberg all of you every time i see the general i look at a grown up and every time i see the present I see something a little different alright how does it how does he get to tell the president what to do it looks to me like you can't and he and I was realized down yeah well he probably can't he's having trouble with that but you know if he leaves the situation of the White House a lot of things are gonna remain exactly the same right he said to chief of staff's they've been had very different backgrounds and I mean runs free Minds previs and then john kelly right so they have very different backgrounds right ryan's came from the RNC political guy and a lot of things have stayed the same now some things did change when John Kelly came in there but still Trump is gonna do what he wants to do right cheapest job is to tell the press before we set on a summit meeting with the Drake care of North Korea we might check with the defense secretary a little little you know protocols like that that apparently are not being honored at all Trump does what he feels like doing when he feels like doing it I mean Trump refuses to be managed in a traditional sense Kelly tried to do that the first few months in the job he found a lot of resistance the president chafed against it and now Kelley is very much in an operational role he's helping run the government but Trump is really calling the shots making the decisions deciding where he goes who he talks to what he does and deciding to have that summit with kim jeong-hoon yeah Trump is his own chief of staff senior advisor and communications director all rolled into one and later for himself and as the as time goes on in the White House he gets more comfortable with his instinct he listened to people less and less I mean you can have a chief of staff that tries to you know control what kind of paper he sees and tries to set up some structures but the president's going to get around it winning streak I think a lot of not just dictators but a lot of people go you know my hunch has seemed to be better than the people around me right no pillar and on things like tariffs for instance the president didn't do that in his first year he listened to people around who said don't do it on withdrawing from the Iran deal he didn't do it but this year as time goes on he'd listen to himself more and more yes he the smartest guy in a White House trunk he thinks he is and he thinks he's smarter not only in terms of intelligence but he thinks he has better political instincts than the political professionals and he's felt that way all along who agrees with him Aneta when he decides like we're not going to deal with the Europeans anymore we're breaking the NATO alliance it's worse than after blah blah blah we don't like the Canadians we don't like the Prime Minister up there we don't like anybody the people we like our Kim jong-un and and Putin we like the world's dictators what does anybody think like him and the one I know Baldwin doesn't think like this who does he have around him says good point and honestly mean it well I mean clearly they're not saying that before this is a good point to make I mean that's not happening so the question is what do they say to him after are they really saying to him you shouldn't have done that are you going to say that to the president United States with that word Phil no they manage the fallout of it so they sort of let him decide to do what he wants to do say what he wants to say and then manage it within the government try to create a system where the Last King of Scotland that movie with Forest Whitaker he played a DI min he fell in love with certain people for a while then he fell out of Nixon was like that Nixon like people like Pat Monte and for a while and then he dropped him is that the president's problem well the problem we have with this president for a couple months and then he gets bored of people he we know he gets bored of people we know that you know he values chemistry between him himself and and the people around him and that usually fizzles unless of course it's a Stanley there are sales from
