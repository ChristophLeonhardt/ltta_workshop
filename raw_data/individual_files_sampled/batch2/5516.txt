de 554 of the Trump administration and the president escalates the war on his former lawyer and confidant Michael Cohen while denying that he had any advanced knowledge about that June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower a source has told NBC News Cohen is willing to tell robert muller that Donald Trump jr. informed his father about the meeting before it took place Trump's son had that meeting with several Russians after he was told they were coming prepared with damaging information about Hillary Clinton well today the president responded with this so the fake news doesn't waste my time with dumb questions no I did not know of the meeting with my son Don Jr sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated Jam taxi cabs maybe we'll explain that one he even retrained retained rather bill and crooked Hillary's lawyer gee I wonder if they helped him make the choice that last reference of course is to Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis who has declined comment on the president's response or to the reports of Cohen's allegations the president steered clear of this topic during his event at the White House today designed to highlight economic numbers as Trump wrapped up however our colleague Kristen Welker asked him about Michael Cohen telling the truth is Michael Cohen telling the truth mr. president is Michael Cohen telling the truth as we say it's been 10 times now the president has ignored reporters questions since the Cohen audio first aired Tuesday evening and for that matter there have only been three White House press briefings in the entire month of July on the Cohen front Politico reports the president's had advisors have quote been taken aback by Cohen's no-holds-barred approach and his willingness to publicly reveal potentially devastating details of his private conversations with the president asked to describe the mood among Trump's close confidants one person close to the president replied simply not good they add this quoting someone close to the president Trump is enraged over the Kohen of the Cohen revelations Emily Jane Fox who is standing by to join us has been covering the Trump Cohen fallout for Vanity Fair her latest piece out just late today details the current mood in the Cohen camp quote now the bond between Trump and Cohen appears to be irrevocably torn asunder there is a sense that Cohen is ready to torch his old boss quote maybe Cohen is going to be the thing that's going to pull this whole thing apart and unravel the myth behind the man one person familiar with Cohen's thinking told her maybe he is all he is the next John Dean Fox also reports one of the people she spoke to referred to Cohen as having quote a treasure trove of information that he says he could unleash in order to reciprocally complicate the president's life Donny Deutsch who recently spoke to Cohen appeared on this network and had this insight into the allegation about that Trump Tower meeting what Michaels made very clear to me is number one and there's a man he worked for for over a decade nothing went on in this business without knowing about it and he had led me to believe that he could bring Trump back to Russia that he what came out yesterday to me was not a surprise based on conversations Michael and I had had everything that was going on Trump knew about did he reference this meeting and particularly as he talked to him as he did Robert Muller for his part has not yet spoken to Donald Trump jr. but the two men were just a few feet apart today Politico published this photo of both men waiting for the same flight out of DC while seemingly unaware of each other of Washington National Airport there is another new development and I regarding the special counsel Muller's office says it plans to call 35 witnesses in financial crimes trial of X Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort which is slated to begin Tuesday this is the first of two trials for Manta fort the witness list was made public just today the biggest name on it no surprise is that man Ric gates Manta Ford's former partner and one-time deputy on the Trump campaign who pleaded guilty and is now cooperating with the Muller investigation after all of that let's bring in our leadoff panel on a Friday evening the aforementioned Emily Jane Fox senior reporter for Vanity Fair we should add she just wrote the book on the Trump family it's called born Trump inside America's first family Josh Gerstein senior White House reporter for Politico and Jill wine bank's attorney and former assistant Watergate special counsel good evening to you all Emily here in New York I'd like to begin with you if this relationship hasn't soured I'd hate to see a relationship that has a little chilly yeah well let's help me help me go through the two camps of belief will you please on how these recordings have entered the public domain there is belief number one that Cohen has leaked these as a brushback pitch to say mr. president there's a lot more where this came from theory number two is that this is coming from the Trump team to go ahead embrace and own some of the worst that they know is coming because that also takes an arrow away from Cohen and his value as a flipped target to the feds please this is a a both very important and very complicated parlor game that we're playing here and it's it's difficult because both sides have credibility issues here so on the one side the Cohen camp not only have people been saying as you said perhaps he's sending this as a signal to what he has and what he could offer to Donald Trump but some people have argued that perhaps he's sending a smoke signal looking for a pardon now people who are close to Cohen and familiar with us that his thinking have flat-out denied that time and time again to me they have said the way that you would get a pardon is not by angering the president and sticking a thumb in his eye repeatedly and even if he were to get some sort of pre pardon then he would undoubtedly be subpoenaed and then have to testify and would not be able to plead the fifth so that is something that according to all of my reporting he has taken off the table on the other side you have president Trump's camp and and there was a school of thought on Friday when the recordings were first released and Rudy Giuliani was the only person on the record describing the subject matter on that we floated you on this project yes so he was able to control the narrative for a few days until Lonny Davis did put out the actual recording earlier this week and so it was kind of a smart tactic to be able to define the narrative even though we now know that the very best case for rudy guiliani there are questions raised about the the narrative that he laid out there so what you have is a complicated set of motivations from each side characters on each side that are not necessarily the most trustworthy or have the greatest credibility and so to try and determine who leaked what when is a difficult game I will say that from my reporting in the Kohen world of the past 24 hours particularly after this revelation last night about what michael cohen may know about the trump tower meeting they have said over and over again we did not leak this because this does not serve us to have this out in the public was not our strategy we wanted to be able to go to the special counsel robert muller with this information it doesn't serve us to have this out in the public now it is possible in some way that it does serve President Trump to have one of the most damaging things out there perhaps to control the narrative again and perhaps to make it more difficult for Michael Cohen to cooperate if Michael Cohen is not going to cooperate then maybe the president can breathe a little easier tonight and Josh the only problem with conversations the likes of which we're having here is it's about the mechanics of leaking and we're forgetting the story in chief is oh yeah by the way it's alleged the President had a heads-up on Russians coming to his office building in New York prior to him becoming president with dirt on his opponent at the top of the ticket as they say one donald trump josh has been conspicuously silent but for his twitter feed this week right and you know given his no collusion mantra that he's put forward time and time again there could hardly be a more damaging allegation than that he was aware in advance that his campaign was endeavoring to get damaging political intelligence about his opponent from Russians and Russians that I believe his own family had been told had some connection to the Russian government so there's no question that this would injure his narrative if people believe it I think the problem is as Emily points out there's a need for some additional corroboration you have a number of figures here whose credibility is not particularly high and who have made a number of statements that proved not to be accurate and the real question I think is not whether Michael Cohen has stories that could damage the president but whether he can lead robert muller or other federal investigators like the folks in New York to provable facts to other sources of information that can allow them to assemble a damaging case against the president if it's just stories that he's telling Michael Cohen I don't think it's gonna be that damaging and now to jail wine banks counselor if there's a short version of this answer if it's answerable in your view how has Cohen's case changed this week since Tuesday how has Trump's case changed this week I would say that Cohen is in the same position he was in terms of whatever evidence exists to against him but that he has put himself in a better position because if he really does have the willingness to testify that he was in the room when Donald Trump's senior learned about the meeting in Trump Tower and if he will identify the other people who rumor has it were also in the room it means that it's not his word against the president's word and as everybody has pointed out they both have credibility issues Giuliani is saying that Cohn is a pathological liar and he knows that because Cohn lied for his client for many years which is not exactly a very strong defense and what does that make the client who hired the lawyer to lie for him so they both have credibility issues but if he can identify other witnesses I think Josh pointed this out it means that there's a really credible case and to some extent if I viewing this as a trial lawyer juries really can make logical conclusions and the evidence at this point is now getting very compelling that there was a clear willingness to accept help from the Russians to win the election to collude with them as the public is calling it or to enter into a conspiracy with them which is what the crime is and I think it really has gone to the stage where we're really getting somewhere now and we could have a very significant case hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you
