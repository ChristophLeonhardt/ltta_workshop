that they included that on here<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

19
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,070

harris remix which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't love it kind</font>

24
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,559
of sounds like anyone could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done it</font>

25
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,210
rather than Calvin Harris doing it

26
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,800
himself and be still which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just such</font>

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,390
a great way to finish the album oh it's

28
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,550
so beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> other so clever those</font>

29
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,980
killers they're so clever habits with

30
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,719
Apollo is like a big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you for a</font>

31
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,160
lot of musicians and it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

32
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,750
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if you've got over</font>

33
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,250
London like you've probably seen quite a

34
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,780
lot of gigs a house with Apollo but the

35
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the killer's it's like a</font>

36
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">really small venue and they actually</font>

37
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,549
tend to play quite a few small venues

38
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,110
when they come to London because London

39
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,400
was the first place that really embraced

40
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
them and I think they like having that

41
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,479
kind of just soldier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah bringing</font>

42
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,250
it back and going to play places like

43
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,680
cocoa and like how a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Smith Apollo which</font>

44
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,500
are not tiny but relative to the size of

45
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,880
Wembley Stadium which they played the

46
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,670
summer I'm really small just felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

47
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,530
very close group of people watching it

48
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,210
there were two guys who absolutely nuts

49
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,159
and just kept like shoving into me like

50
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,500
full body slams and I push them harder

51
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">than I've ever pushed anyone in my life</font>

52
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I literally two hands like shoved</font>

53
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,619
one of them to decide knows that<font color="#E5E5E5"> K back</font>

54
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> f off except I desde f when you walk</font>

55
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards house with a point it has a</font>

56
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,130
really kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> old-style announcement</font>

57
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,140
concert lettering on the outside as well

58
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,240
as the killers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went with my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> friend</font>

59
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,920
Tom and doors were at seven so we got

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,780
there like six to be a bit early but

61
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,210
also not to be too early<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I had a</font>

62
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,320
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to do in the day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he did</font>

63
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">as well because it was coming down from</font>

64
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,270
Oxford and we got inside maybe 15 rows

65
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,090
back somehow you know ended up about six

66
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,920
rows from the front they played like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

67
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,360
hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half set and it was</font>

68
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">absolutely outstanding like the</font>

69
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,568
engagement of the crowd Brandon Flowers

70
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,290
oh my god what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hero</font>

71
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,810
like he can he loves a crowd so much and

72
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,760
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> just he has this joy in performing</font>

73
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,859
which I know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of seems to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go without</font>

74
00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,450
saying but there was so many acts I've

75
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,980
seen you just do not seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy</font>

76
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,659
performing whatsoever sometimes it's

77
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:24,159
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the context like I saw kings</font>

78
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:25,450
of leon headline reading and they were

79
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely terrible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a feeling they</font>

80
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,959
just don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like reading and just</font>

81
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,769
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to headline that</font>

82
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,209
first of all the Brandon Flowers is such

83
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:32,950
like a Las Vegas boy just loves<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

84
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">performance he loves the stage and he</font>

85
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,370
just gives such a great performance he

86
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,109
just smiles all the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> climbing on top</font>

87
00:02:38,109 --> 00:02:39,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things and lying down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on things and</font>

88
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,400
like waving microphone stands around and

89
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">he's such a great performance it's a</font>

90
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,790
thrill to<font color="#CCCCCC"> watch him but says everyone</font>

91
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,200
else as well you know all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest</font>

92
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,189
of the band they're doing they're so

93
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:49,510
knows when won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even eat she was doing</font>

94
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,769
his drum solo it's just an electric

95
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">performance but I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of getting</font>

96
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">ahead of myself here cuz i'm so excited</font>

97
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,389
just thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and indeed when i</font>

98
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:58,120
got back the gig I just chatting to

99
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,560
anyone who was awake about it and

100
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,060
everyone thought that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was absolutely</font>

101
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,900
smashed or that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drugs so yeah</font>

102
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyway so going back they opened with</font>

103
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">shut the night which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is such good song</font>

104
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,790
to open with he'd actually open through

105
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,530
that on jools holland<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the BBC like</font>

106
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,060
the night before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's actually</font>

107
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,500
that joke crowd-pleasing tune that

108
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,239
everyone loves to sing<font color="#CCCCCC"> along to and it</font>

109
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,129
just it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really gets you going makes you</font>

110
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:19,900
want to have a really good good night

111
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,459
and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned the engagement of the</font>

112
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,290
audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the whole gig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Brown was</font>

113
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,729
very keen to push the whole seeing your

114
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:26,620
long think people just kept going seeing

115
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,359
the baseline after from here on out

116
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:30,010
finished and then they went back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

117
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,720
played it from the chorus again so that

118
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we could have a whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sing long session</font>

119
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,079
again and that happened at many stages

120
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,310
throughout the night there's lots of

121
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,530
like play and lots of cheeky going back

122
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,790
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of the song</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brown</font>

123
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,349
flowers also did his acoustic version of

124
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:42,729
read my mind which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

125
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,459
you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before but if so beeyoutiful</font>

126
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">it just kind of is one of those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moments</font>

127
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,329
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to stop and listen and</font>

128
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:50,949
not do anything now some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

129
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,540
basically stand with the whole gig with

130
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,799
that arm<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> air foam here with a</font>

131
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:54,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or taking pictures with a camera</font>

132
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,099
most these people kind of like brought

133
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,720
down those cameras<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though that was</font>

134
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,849
almost the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideal setting for video can</font>

135
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:01,810
you don't have as many people jogging

136
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,129
your hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people just wanted to</font>

137
00:04:03,129 --> 00:04:05,290
be present and in that moment I can

138
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually just fill my mouth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like talking</font>

139
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,650
away at it again but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was such a</font>

140
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,720
special gig it was so<font color="#E5E5E5"> special to be</font>

141
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that for them the last have</font>

142
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,259
many times I've seen they finished when

143
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,400
you were young because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a really</font>

144
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,228
great big one to go out but then they

145
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:18,820
came back for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Encore with Jenny and</font>

146
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,200
it's very clearly getting to the time

147
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,488
where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be out the venue</font>

148
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,690
there was a real panic that passed

149
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:23,740
around through everyone that they

150
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,690
weren't gonna play most

151
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,280
bright side and I've mentioned this so

152
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,990
many times before but Mr Brightside is

153
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,730
like the single most important song in

154
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,310
the world for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me like it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is such an</font>

155
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,410
important song to me and I was getting

156
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,700
really worried because<font color="#E5E5E5"> firstly I knew</font>

157
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they not only finished when you</font>

158
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,520
were young and that also they would play

159
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,530
Jenny because it was a big song in the

160
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,150
UK and that was the yag in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

161
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,040
first ones that we really embraced so

162
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,300
it's pretty panicked in the back of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

163
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,290
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they weren't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to play it</font>

164
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then that just a little riff started</font>

165
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,670
and the spotlight<font color="#CCCCCC"> and was a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

166
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,590
song they played and it was such a

167
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,690
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like danced my</font>

168
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,500
bleeding legs off I was so excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

169
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,180
dancing there and beat there in that

170
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,220
moment in a house with Apollo with the

171
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">killer's listening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that song with my</font>

172
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,110
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just having I just felt so in</font>

173
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,960
life I felt so alive I mean I like I

174
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,660
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I felt infinite but like</font>

175
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,910
that that's a phrase that's been used

176
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,950
and like pushed to the edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of its</font>

177
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,810
meaning that it has lost meaning for me

178
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,850
but that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it felt like it felt</font>

179
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,140
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could go off forever and I</font>

180
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,970
wanted it to go forever but I knew had

181
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,040
to be over but I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be that</font>

182
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,270
are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that moment for such a long time</font>

183
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,880
listening to mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> brightside but then ok</font>

184
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,110
so like they've been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

185
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and drumsticks have been thrown out</font>

186
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,250
throughout the gig like as you do with

187
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,070
the very last set of drumsticks<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

188
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">thrown out at the end of mr.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brightside</font>

189
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,370
and so the very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one fell</font>

190
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,750
around a meter in front of me and

191
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">suddenly everyone like piles down this</font>

192
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">dolls grabbing the scruff of my neck and</font>

193
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,919
like yanking me down so for a second I

194
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">couldn't breathe I reach down like</font>

195
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,850
grabbed it someone snatches it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

196
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,910
hand and then they drop it right in

197
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,190
front of me so I snatched it down grab

198
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,169
this amazing job so to actually have

199
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,900
over here one second and fill it in my

200
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,570
handbag and so here we have a Ronnie

Vannucci drumstick from The Killers<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font>

and from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. brightside encore with</font>

203
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,710
jenny was a friend of mine as well and

204
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,690
look you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the little ridges you</font>

205
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,370
can buy t-shirts and stuff as I clearly

206
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,430
have and you can buy CDs but gigs are

207
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,080
special because they only exist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

208
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,490
mind but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

209
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,650
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I feel like it's like an</font>

210
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,419
enchanted object it has like a physical

211
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,520
physical power to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I actually</font>

212
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,960
slept with it under my pillow every

213
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,000
night since I saw the killer's last week

214
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,860

215
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,620
