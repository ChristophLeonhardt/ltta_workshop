WELL.

17
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:41,728
I'M SORT OF CURIOUS HOW

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,796
REPUBLICANS ARE DISTINGUISHING

19
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:45,098
THEMSELVES WHEN THERE ARE SO

20
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:48,368
MANY IN THE FIELD RIGHT NOW.

21
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:50,837
>> WELL, FIRST OFF, IT'S GOING

22
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:51,337
TO BE WITH YOU.

23
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:53,406
YOU SAID I'M NOT IN THE STUDIO,

24
00:00:53,406 --> 00:00:56,109
BUT HERE IN THE GREATEST STATE

25
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,944
OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND THERE'S A

26
00:00:57,944 --> 00:01:00,246
CROWDED FIELD AND 12 REPUBLICANS

27
00:01:00,246 --> 00:01:02,048
REMAIN IN THE RACE.

28
00:01:02,048 --> 00:01:03,783
WE TRY TO COMMUNICATE WHERE WE

29
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:05,818
STAND ON ISSUES AND IN THIS

30
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:08,054
DISTRICT YOU HAVE TO BE A

31
00:01:08,054 --> 00:01:08,821
FISCAL, AND NATIONAL SECURITY

32
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,523
CONSERVATIVE AND THAT'S OUR

33
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:11,891
MESSAGE AND SEEMS TO BE

34
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:13,092
RESONATING AND THAT'S WHAT FOLKS

35
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:15,328
HERE BELIEVE IN AND WHAT THEY

36
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:16,629
GOT WITH TREY GOWDY.

37
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:17,964
ELIZABETH: HOW ARE REPUBLICANS

38
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:20,600
SETTING THEMSELVES APART?

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,036
I'M NOT MISTAKEN YOU HAD A TOWN

40
00:01:23,036 --> 00:01:24,137
HALL FORUM ON WEDNESDAY.

41
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:26,272
SOME OF THE CRITICS WERE SAYING

42
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,709
EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO ALIGN

43
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:30,877
THEMSELVES CLOSER TO TRUMP.

44
00:01:30,877 --> 00:01:32,378
THERE WASN'T A WAY TO

45
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:33,012
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE

46
00:01:33,012 --> 00:01:34,781
CANDIDATES AND HOW ARE YOU DOING

47
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:35,081
THAT?

48
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:36,082
>> EVERY PERSON IS SUPPORTING

49
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:37,684
THE PRESIDENT AND I THINK ALL

50
00:01:37,684 --> 00:01:39,419
REPUBLICANS IN THIS PRIMARY WANT

51
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:41,587
THIS PRESIDENT TO SUCCEED,

52
00:01:41,587 --> 00:01:42,822
SUCCEED ON IMMIGRATION AND

53
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:45,425
SUCCESSFUL ON REDUCING THE

54
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:46,526
DEFICIT AND BRINGING DOWN THE

55
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:46,859
DEBT.

56
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:48,861
ALL OF US HAVE A DIFFERENT

57
00:01:48,861 --> 00:01:51,397
SKILLSET AND EACH ONE OF US ARE

58
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:53,433
DRAWING CONTRAST, WHAT'S OUR

59
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:54,600
LIFE EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS

60
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,034
EXPERIENCE?

61
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:56,703
WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO THIS POINT.

62
00:01:56,703 --> 00:01:57,937
ANYBODY CAN SAY ANYTHING DURING

63
00:01:57,937 --> 00:01:59,339
THE CAMPAIGN, YOU ALL KNOW THAT,

64
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:00,573
YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME.

65
00:02:00,573 --> 00:02:02,041
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

66
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,176
COMMUNICATE, LOOK AT OUR RECORD,

67
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:04,610
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE, WHAT

68
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,813
I'VE DONE AND WHY I'M BEST

69
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:09,449
QUALIFIED TO SIR OF THE FOURTH

70
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:10,717
DISTRICT IN CONGRESS AND

71
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:11,551
CONTINUING THE CONSERVATIVE

72
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:11,918
LEGACY.

73
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:17,857
ALL OF US AGREE WE'RE SPORTYIVE

74
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:18,758

75
00:02:18,758 --> 00:02:20,927
AND HOW CAN WE BEST BE THE ALLY

76
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:21,728
IN CONGRESS.

77
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:23,730
ELIZABETH: I'M CURIOUS AS TO

78
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,098
WHAT ISSUES YOU FOUND REALLY THE

79
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:26,666
MOST HOT BED OUT OF THAT

80
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:27,367
DISCUSSION ON WEDNESDAY.

81
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:28,634
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT

82
00:02:28,634 --> 00:02:29,068
IMMIGRATION?

83
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,371
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

84
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:34,974
SAYING THE EFFECT OF TAX REFORM?

85
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:36,809
WHAT ARE THE SOUTH CAROLINAIONS

86
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:38,311
CONCERNED ABOUT ON TUESDAY.

87
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,313
IF THERE ARE 12 FOLKS, IT'S

88
00:02:40,313 --> 00:02:43,015
GOING TO A RUNOFF UNLESS

89
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:46,252
SOMEBODY GETS 50% PLUS ONE AND

90
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:49,455
WITH 12 PEOPLE, IT'S HARD TO GET

91
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:50,089
TO 50%.

92
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:52,825
>> A RUNOFF, WE'RE PREPARING FOR

93
00:02:52,825 --> 00:02:53,159
THAT.

94
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,295
THE TWO BIGGEST ISSUES PEOPLE

95
00:02:56,295 --> 00:02:59,399
ARE WORRIED ABOUT IN SOUTH

96
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,466
CAROLINA, THE TRILLION DOLLAR

97
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:02,101
DEFICIT AND OPEN BORDERS.

98
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:03,269
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING

99
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,538
ABOUT, WHETHER I'M IN A DEBATE

100
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:07,173
OR A COFFEE SHOP.

101
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,574
HOW TO END TRILLION DOLLAR

102
00:03:08,574 --> 00:03:09,175
DEFICIT.

103
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:10,443
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO GO FROM 20

104
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:12,745
TRILLION IN DEBT TO 40 TRILLION

105
00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:15,515
IN THE NEXT TEN, 20 YEARS, AND

106
00:03:15,515 --> 00:03:16,616
WE CANNOT AFFORD THAT.

107
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:17,950
PEOPLE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED

108
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,186
ABOUT FOR DECADES WE'VE HAD

109
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:21,387
VIRTUALLY AN OPEN BORDER POLICY.

110
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:22,622
THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN

111
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:24,590
THE COUNTRY, UNAUTHORIZED, NOT

112
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,260
SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

113
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,728
WE HAVE GANGS AND VIOLENCE

114
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:30,062
COMING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN

115
00:03:30,062 --> 00:03:30,430
BORDER.

116
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,631
PEOPLE ARE WORRIEDMENT WHAT DO

117
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,300
WE DO TO REDUCE THE DEFICIT, THE

118
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,535
DEBT AND GET CONTROL OF OUR

119
00:03:35,535 --> 00:03:36,602
BORDERS AGAIN.

120
00:03:36,602 --> 00:03:38,304
IF WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OF OUR

121
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:39,939
BORDERS, WE'RE NOT REALLY A

122
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:40,273
COUNTRY.

123
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:41,474
ELIZABETH: THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT

124
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:43,476
NOT ONLY SOUTH CAROLINIANS ARE

125
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:44,544
CONCERNED ABOUT, BUT VOTERS

126
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:45,311
ACROSS THE NATION.

127
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,246
MY LAST QUESTION, YOU DID PICK

128
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:48,514
UP A MAJOR ENFORCEMENT.

129
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:50,716
WHAT GROUP IS NOW SUPPORTING YOU

130
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,718
AND HAS THAT PROPELLED YOU?

131
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,454
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE ENDORSED

132
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,621
BY CLUB FOR GROWTH.

133
00:03:55,621 --> 00:03:57,723
THE SAME THAT SUPPORTED JIM

134
00:03:57,723 --> 00:03:59,325
DEMINT AND TOM COTTON AND TED

135
00:03:59,325 --> 00:04:01,327
CRUZ AND MIKE LEE AND THE GREAT

136
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,061
CONSERVATIVES FIGHTING ON

137
00:04:02,061 --> 00:04:03,329
CAPITOL HILL EVERY DAY.

138
00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:04,297
I CAN'T BE--

139
00:04:04,297 --> 00:04:06,666
I'M SO THANKFUL TO BE IN THE

140
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:07,834
COMPANY OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE

141
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,068
GIANTS AND THANKFUL FOR THE

142
00:04:09,068 --> 00:04:10,369
GREAT WORK THAT CLUB FOR GROWTH

143
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:13,406
HAS ENGAGED IN PROVIDING LIMITED

144
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:14,173
GOVERNMENT AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM

145
00:04:14,173 --> 00:00:00,000
AND I'LL BE TRUE TO THAT
