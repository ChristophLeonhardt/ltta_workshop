can I on mark Latham and today I'm looking at the madness of the way in which our schools are promoting gender fluidity now one of the big controversies in the Australian education system in the last couple of years has been a thing called Safe Schools it was originally promoted as an anti-bullying program but then the founder of the program a Marxist leftist academic from Victoria rose Ward she let the cat out of the bag she said it was all about gender and sexual diversity his Roz Ward and as a committed Marxist Ward went on to acknowledge that Safe Schools program was about promoting social change from a Marxist perspective it's not hard to understand why the Marxist want to promote gender fluidity in our schools that confuses young people makes them agitated about their identity makes them potentially rise up against what Ward calls the existing social order and of course it attacks the nuclear family something that Marxist derived as a source of social stability and part of the way in which capitalism survives in our society so of course the Marxist want to attack the family they want to attack the notion of gender reality that you're born either as a boy or a girl they want young people to think that everything is fluid in their lives the wonder of it of course is how these Marxists have got a foothold in our education system how they're allowed to promote these programs in our schools that's the real evil of what's going on and the failure of Labour and liberal education ministers around the country to do anything about this insidious program now in New South Wales the biggest Australian state in April the Education Minister this guy Rob Stoke said it was abolishing Safe Schools out the window he was going to replace it with a new anti-bullying program well then in August have a look at this headline The Sydney Daily Telegraph busted bureaucrats in the Education Department they're running things the public servants run the schools not the minister they were introducing Safe Schools another Trojan horse approached to have it up and running in sex education courses and against States was forced to say I know that won't happen and I'll sort these bureaucrats out or discipline them no such thing has happened in fact the public servants are running amok when it comes to gender fluidity programs in our schools I've been told about the resurrection of Safe Schools in New South Wales under a new guise a third Trojan horse approach Versalles anti bullying then it was sex education now under the banner of child protection they're reintroducing this garbage into our schools the ministers and run the education system neo-marxist public servants do and that's the real problem we've got in Australia and have a look at what I've uncovered here this is the curriculum outlined for personal development health and physical education courses under the banner of child protection stage three education so we're talking years five and six so these are kids as young as ten kids as young as ten are going to be told here you can see it here in black and white in the syllabus outline that feminine and masculine are not necessarily inherent categories that pre-exists in each individual they're trying to say to a young boy you can really be a girl they're trying to say to a girl you can be a boy anytime you like and what they're talking about here is an insidious approach where parents educators and popular culture can speak and practice gender as a binder isms that is the binary approach or either male or female under our common understanding of biological science and they're encouraging children to act as their own agents in the construction and maintenance agenda category so rebel against your parents and get stuck into this neo-marxist garbage that's what's being taught now it goes beyond that you can hear see here under the class materials page that they've got a class exercise where the kids are encouraged to bring into school a collection of birthday cards they and their siblings have received over there so loving parents agree on out the birthday cards they've got to bring it into school the teacher will put the girl's cards up on the display board and the boys on a different display board but of course the political correctness comes into play the teachers are told there it is in black and white avoid using labels such as boys cards or girls pitches so gender political correctness the D gendering of language you can't use expressions like boys cards or girls pictures according to the New York's is drawing up the education curriculum and then it goes on to encourage the kids to question the way in which they've been portrayed on these birthday cards by their loving parents such as a direct attack on the nuclear family and they're asked what kind of pictures for cards would better describe the way you really are so your parents have got it wrong you're not really like this you give us the description of the way you really are you can see that in the section under the discussion and the questions that are put to the students and then at the end of this gender fluidity propaganda you've got the statement here that individual understandings and personal choices about gender that never exist in a vacuum no you can't have biological science normal acceptable and desirable ways of an acting gender vary among the different groups we belong and interact with therefore positions taken up by individuals can often be contradictory or fluid there it is gender fluidity those girls and women and boys and men take up a range of different feminine and masculine stances so it's just crazy that this stuff has got so far into the education system if there's a direct threat to our learning and it just shows you it just shows you the madness of our schools move beyond being learning institutions to get into radical gender theory to get into sexuality to get into things that the parents would rather talk to their kids about as the needs arise and beyond that you've got a lot of kids in these schools gaming a system they're boys one day girls the next I think transgender is funny or it makes them stand out I've spoken to teachers who say that you've got kids who've worked out that nobody can touch them in the school if they play the transgender card because any teacher it said look you know we gaming the system here this is just some sort of prank you're playing on the school if the kid was to do anything about their personal safety suicide or anything like that the teachers live in fear you couldn't possibly touch the kids because they'll be out of a job and front-page news in the newspaper so the system is frozen on the basis of concerns about mental health and the fact they've introduced radical gender Theory teachers think they're doing the job the parents the teachers have got to the point now when it comes to gender and sexuality under these new Marxist programs the teachers think they're the parents well I've got news for the teachers in government schools around Australia some of you do a decent job some of you absolutely bloody hopeless but none of you none of you are the parents of our children in our lives you are still relative strangers and feature at the parent-teacher night and a few other occasions school pick up and you like but you are still relative strangers in our lives there are kids and I can tell you what as a parent as long as my backside points to the ground I won't be letting any of my kids through any of these programs this is a role for families the nuclear family and parents to talk to their kids about these issues rather than being spun out and hypnotized behind the ho Marxist propaganda that should never be in the curriculum should never be in the syllabus I'm Mark Latham for rebel Australia and if you like this video please share it with all your family and friends on
