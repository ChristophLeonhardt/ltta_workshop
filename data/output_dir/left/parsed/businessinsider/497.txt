I mean I don't know if you're going bald
baby I'm will wet and I'm Graham
Flanagan this is what happened when we
drove a Tesla across America we're
leaving Denver driving due east across
the state of Nebraska to get to Omaha
which is our next destination
our navigations I'm just going where she
told me to go take a right but it says
that it says left left okay there we go
found it all right good job room thanks
will okay sorry tenth supercharged
station of a trip I believe by and this
is our first supercharged station of day
four
you just got mad at me because I just
manually decided without the help of the
computer to come to this supercharger
station when you found out that I hadn't
navigated to the final destination you
freaked out
why so Oh Mahalo foot is our final
destination today we should be putting
that in the computer rather than putting
in individual super targets but this
time though I knew my brain was able to
sir my only cares about your brain
people care about what this Tesla car
can do here's my here opinion see see
grandma stop talking to me he's angry
for some reason things are tense
so you think your body yeah I think I'm
balding I think I mean I don't know if
you're going bald
baby I really love my hair my hair is
great
I got thick its luscious there's so much
of it every time I get a haircut without
fail they at barber or the person
cutting my hair they're always like
that's a lot of hair
all right so we're walking from the
supercharger station to get some food
I grant thinks it's a good idea to walk
that way I'll meet you somewhere I'm
going this way all right here's what's
around the supercharger station
we're in the middle of Nebraska we found
this place called and runs up it's a
fast food chain we've seen a few here
and there in parts of Colorado now
Nebraska or probably a lot more so we
decided to try it
all right it's 7:00 p.m. Central time so
you know what let me say this first
gravich and sleeping this entire drive
this entire leg of this drive
awful awful what a terrible terrible
road trip man I'm all in man
let's move here let's never leave here
it's 10:30 p.m.
that trip took longer than we thought we
made for supercharger station stops the
lights just went off I think that's a
sign yeah let's go all right bye have a
good night
navigate to Warren Buffett's house Prem
has decided that he wants to stalk
Warren Buffett and learn how to be a
villager we got a notification that said
we got a drive below 55 miles per hour
in order for us to hit our destination
without losing battery okay so that is
extremely extremely nerve-racking
