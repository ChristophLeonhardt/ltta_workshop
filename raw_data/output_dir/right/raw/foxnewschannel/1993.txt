>> Martha: OF COURSE IT IS.

48
00:01:14,218 --> 00:01:14,985
>> I JUST CAME UP FROM THE

49
00:01:14,985 --> 00:01:16,821
DECISION DESK AND I CAN TELL YOU

50
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:18,155
THAT ANYBODY WHO TELLS YOU THAT

51
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:18,923
THEY KNOW HOW THIS WEST VIRGINIA

52
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:20,424
RACE IS GOING TO TURN OUT

53
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:21,592
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE

54
00:01:21,592 --> 00:01:23,360
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE WE HAVE

55
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,662
NEVER SEEN A CONTEST LIKE THIS

56
00:01:24,662 --> 00:01:26,330
IN WEST VIRGINIA, EVER, EVER.

57
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:27,598
THERE'S GOING TO BE BIGGER

58
00:01:27,598 --> 00:01:30,201
TURNOUT, THERE'S MORE INTEREST.

59
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:31,702
THEY'VE NEVER HAD A FOX NEWS

60
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:32,136
DEBATE THERE.

61
00:01:32,136 --> 00:01:33,537
THEY'VE NEVER HAD A REPUBLICAN

62
00:01:33,537 --> 00:01:34,972
PRIMARY WITH $10 MILLION IN IT.

63
00:01:34,972 --> 00:01:35,806
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S GOING TO

64
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:36,640
BE AND THAT'S WHY WE PLAY THE

65
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,210
GAME, IT'S AWESOME.

66
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,011
>> Martha: DAVID, YOUR GUY

67
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:41,946
THERE, PATRICK MORRISEY AND AS

68
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,214
CHRIS SAID WE DON'T KNOW HOW

69
00:01:43,214 --> 00:01:45,182
THIS IS GOING TO TURN OUT BUT

70
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:46,684
THIS RACE HAS GOTTEN A WHOLE LOT

71
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:48,686
OF ATTENTION AND DON BLANKENSHIP

72
00:01:48,686 --> 00:01:49,620
OF ATTENTION AND DON BLANKENSHI

73
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,354
BLANKENSHIP, WHO WAS TRAILING --

74
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:51,622
THE POLLS ARE SO TRICKY, IT'S

75
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:52,389
HARD TO KNOW HOW REFLECTIVE THEY

76
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,024
REALLY WERE.

77
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:54,825
HE WAS TRAILING AND THEN IT

78
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,427
LOOKED LIKE HE PICKED UP A BIT

79
00:01:56,427 --> 00:01:58,929
OF MOMENTUM, YOUR THOUGHTS?

80
00:01:58,929 --> 00:01:59,997
>> I THINK THE WEST VIRGINIA

81
00:01:59,997 --> 00:02:00,765
RACE IS AN INCREDIBLY

82
00:02:00,765 --> 00:02:03,200
INTERESTING ONE FOR THE COUNTRY

83
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,902
AS A WHOLE BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT

84
00:02:04,902 --> 00:02:08,839
PATRICK MORRISEY, THE TWO-TIME

85
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:09,372
ATTORNEY GENERAL OF

86
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:09,907
WEST VIRGINIA WINS.

87
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:11,942
I THINK YOU WILL BE THE BEST

88
00:02:11,942 --> 00:02:14,045
CANDIDATE IN A GENERAL ELECTION.

89
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:15,846
HOWEVER, IF MORRISEY LOSES TO

90
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:18,449
JENKINS, I THINK WE HAVE A

91
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:19,350
TERRIFIC CHANCE IF EITHER OF

92
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,320
THOSE OF THE NOMINEES TO BEAT

93
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,455
THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT SENATOR.

94
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:26,724
THE PRESIDENT WON THAT STATE

95
00:02:26,724 --> 00:02:28,626
OVERWHELMINGLY BY ABOUT 34

96
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:28,960
POINTS.

97
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,694
IT IS A PLACE THAT DONALD TRUMP

98
00:02:29,694 --> 00:02:33,731
CAN REALLY HELP US DEFEAT AN

99
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:34,465
INCUMBENT U.S. SENATOR THAT WE

100
00:02:34,465 --> 00:02:36,133
NEED TO BE.

101
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,170
IT IS GOING TO BE A LONG ROAD IF

102
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,972
BLANKENSHIP UNFORTUNATELY WINS

103
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:42,940
THAT RACE.

104
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,975
>> Martha: WILL HAVE A LOT TO

105
00:02:43,975 --> 00:02:45,376
TALK ABOUT IN EITHER CASE THERE

106
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:45,943
WHEN WE GET SOME MORE

107
00:02:45,943 --> 00:02:47,845
INFORMATION ON THAT.

108
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,347
CAPRI, LET ME GO TO YOU.

109
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:50,014
LET'S TALK OHIO, WHERE YOU

110
00:02:50,014 --> 00:02:52,783
WATCHING THERE?

111
00:02:52,783 --> 00:02:54,552
>> A NUMBER OF THINGS.

112
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:55,753
FIRST AND FOREMOST, THE

113
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:58,422
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR.

114
00:02:58,422 --> 00:03:01,359
A MATCHUP OF FOUR INDIVIDUALS.

115
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,894
TWO LEADING FOLKS IN THIS RACE,

116
00:03:03,894 --> 00:03:04,628
FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL OF OHIO,

117
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:07,264
FORMER TREASURER AND MOST

118
00:03:07,264 --> 00:03:09,266
NOTABLY THE FORMER HEAD OF THE

119
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,101
CONSUMER PROTECTION FINANCE

120
00:03:10,101 --> 00:03:12,937
BUREAU FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS

121
00:03:12,937 --> 00:03:14,238
VERSUS DENNIS KUCINICH.

122
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:15,506
DENNIS THE MENACE, WHO WAS A

123
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,475
MEMBER OF CONGRESS FOR A NUMBER

124
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,643
OF YEARS AND FAMOUSLY BANKRUPT

125
00:03:19,643 --> 00:03:22,713
THE CITY OF CLEVELAND EVEN

126
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:23,447
THOUGH THEY ACTUALLY ENDORSED

127
00:03:23,447 --> 00:03:24,682
HIM FOR THIS RACE.

128
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:28,352
I ACTUALLY VOTED -- MY FORMER

129
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:31,155
COLLEAGUE IN THE OHIO SENATE WHO

130
00:03:31,155 --> 00:03:32,289
IS ALSO A FORM AT SENATE

131
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,524
MINORITY LEADER BECAUSE HE'S A

132
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:34,258
GUY WHO IS COMMON SENSE AND CAN

133
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:36,761
ACTUALLY I THINK BRING THE TRUMP

134
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,828
VOTERS BACK INTO THE FOLD SINCE

135
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:39,597
HE'S FROM THE VALLEY LIKE I AM.

136
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:40,765
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

137
00:03:40,765 --> 00:03:41,866
BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY A MATCHUP

138
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:43,968
BETWEEN THE PROGRESSIVE WING AND

139
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:46,003
DENNIS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT

140
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:48,939
WING AND CORDRAY.

141
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,843
WE WILL SEE HOW THIS PLAYS OUT.

142
00:03:52,843 --> 00:03:54,645
>> Martha: THE ESTABLISHMENT

143
00:03:54,645 --> 00:03:57,782
WING?

144
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,216
>> COMPARED TO DENNIS HE IS THE

145
00:03:59,216 --> 00:03:59,984
ESTABLISHMENT WING.

146
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:01,385
>> Martha: THAT JUST PRETTY

147
00:04:01,385 --> 00:00:00,000
MUCH SUMS IT ALL.
