1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,780
Why are ninjas such a big deal?

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,240
I’m gonna be honest here.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,740
Ninjas — they just aren’t cool.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,460
Maybe if they could jump over a waterfall,
but I don’t—

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,980
Whoa.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,420
Ok.

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,680
I love Ninjas.

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,300
But why do we know about them?

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,600
Why is this a “Ninja” Warrior?

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,940
Why do 60,000 people on LinkedIn have something
“Ninja” in their profile?

11
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:51,020
How did Westerners - and especially Americans-
obsessed with this Japanese group of super

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,250
secret spy soldier cool people?

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,460
Ninjas have a huge space in our culture — one
that other groups just don’t.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,120
A medieval order in Persia literally gave
us the word for ASSASSIN.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,500
But we don’t constantly hear about them.

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,540
Those teenage mutant turtles?

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,080
They’re ninjas.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,680
Ninjas have a surprising history that spans
centuries - and it’s one that shows the

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,100
unpredictable ways a culture can spread throughout
the entire world.

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:31,250
Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi is not
an accurate portrayal of Japanese history.

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:37,220
Real ninjas practiced ninjitsu, the modern
term for the mix of espionage and assassination

22
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,030
that occurred from the 1400s to the 1800s.

23
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,480
Speaking pretty roughly here.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:47,960
But ninjas did actually sneak into castles,
conduct assassinations, and even have

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,400
sweet ninja gear like this water spider.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,310
They put each foot in the middle of one of
these and used them to paddle across the water.

27
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,640
But these ninjas didn’t have to wear the
black jumpsuit as part of the job.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,960
As spies from the lower class, they were more
likely to have hid in a crowd.

29
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,940
The jumpsuit imagery we associate with ninjas
may have even come from the theatre.

30
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,250
This was a kabuki performance, the traditional
Japanese style of theatre and dance.

31
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,640
And look down here.

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,960
Do you see him?

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,180
This was a kabuki stagehand, dressed in black
so he wouldn’t be visible.

34
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,840
In kabuki, an actor playing a ninja would
often dress the same way, so the audience

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,140
would be surprised by a stagehand becoming
part of the action.

36
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,390
This contributed to the Japanese mythology
of the ninja, as in this legendary manga from

37
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,420
1814.

38
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,319
This Japanese mythmaking continued in early
20th century Japanese novels that portrayed

39
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,700
Japanese culture, and ninjas, as mercenary,
magical, and everything in between.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,540
Ninjas became a pretty fluid myth.

41
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:03,700
Often they had special powers, and occasionally
they were incognito, sometimes in jumpsuits.

42
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,840
Then all started to change when Japan started
making movies.

43
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,560
Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai is a famous
export of Japanese cinema - artistic yet gripping.

44
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:30,220
It’s come to symbolize the flourishing Japanese
cinematic golden age of the 50s and 60s.

45
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,349
It famously inspired the Western movie remake,
The Magnificent Seven.

46
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:39,920
But high art movies weren’t wasn’t the
only kind of influential Japanese cinema.

47
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,860
1962’s Shinobi No Mono didn’t get love
from American critics — but it did start

48
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:49,720
a series that set boundaries for the ninja
myth.

49
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:59,380
This popular 8-film series featured non-magical,
covert ninjas that were similar to what we

50
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,420
imagine today.

51
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,260
The series reportedly inspired Hollywood too.

52
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,430
Screenwriter Roald Dahl —
Yes, Willy Wonka’s Roald Dahl —

53
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,960
decided to include ninjas in a James Bond
movie after seeing one of the movies.

54
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,519
“This is my ninja training school.”

55
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,499
But unlike the ninjas in Japanese movies at
the time, James Bond’s ninjas were illogically

56
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:29,810
dressed cannon fodder.

57
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:33,460
And they were a preview of the Ninja-sploitation
to come.

58
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,380
Yeah.

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,400
Enter the Ninja is generally credited with
kicking off the 80s ninja wave in theatres.

60
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,840
Starring perennial ninja star Sho Kosugi,
it typifies the genre by being

61
00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:09,140
extremely violent - except when the kicks
completely miss.

62
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,600
And by including irrationally kitted out ninjas…and
this:

63
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,520
“Morning.”

64
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,740
"Morning."

65
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,260
Now neither of us can unsee that clip.

66
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,099
In general this trend was kicked off by books
like The Ninja - it sold millions of copies

67
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:40,710
and spent more than 20 weeks on the New York
Times bestseller list.

68
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,169
Semi-prestige miniseries like Shogun joined
the craze,

69
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:51,490
And there was 1985’s American Ninja, in
which a ninja was this guy.

70
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,339
But calling out a few examples actually sells
short the sheer volume of crap that had “Ninja”

71
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,990
slapped on the cover in the 80s and 90s.

72
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,260
By the time Ninja Turtles and Three Ninjas
—the ninja series with kids — rolled around,

73
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,700
American culture was happy to start remixing
ninjas.

74
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,939
The final step?

75
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:18,279
A word so bland that you can get a job as
a writing ninja.

76
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:24,479
It is true that American ninjas don’t have
a lot to do with the fighting ninjas of feudal

77
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,479
Japan.

78
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:29,349
But the on-screen Japanese ninjas never had
much to do with it either.

79
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:34,930
The strength of Japanese culture, through
books, and cartoons, and movies, made them

80
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,930
ubiquitous.

81
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:40,480
It takes a lot of work to hide so well that
the whole world finds you.

82
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,979
There are a lot of great resources when it
comes to ninjas.

83
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,780
One that I recommend is “Vintage Ninja,”
which will let you see all the gloriously

84
00:06:54,780 --> 00:00:00,000
tacky, kitschy, crappy, scary, freaky ninjas
that have appeared on screen over the years.
