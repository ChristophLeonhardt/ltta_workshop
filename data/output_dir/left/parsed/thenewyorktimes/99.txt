Out here in
agriculture country,
we can’t just sit around
and hope that things
are going to get better.
I’m a Republican.
I’ve always been a Republican.
I voted for President Trump.
I want to support him.
China and others have
targeted our farmers.
Not good.
Not nice.
And you know what our
farmers are saying?
It’s O.K., we can take it.
These are incredible people.
We can take it.
That makes my blood
boil,
because by God, I’ll tell you this:
I can draw a
direct line
from when the president
started this tariff rhetoric
in the price of my soybeans.
The United States was allowed
to truly get ripped off.
In March, the price of
soybeans was $10.50 a bushel.
Today, it’s $8.50 a bushel.
That’s a 20% decrease.
I have to tell you, Mr.
President, this hurts.
This is hurting our
long-term future.
This is hurting me.
Whether it’s transportation,
whether it’s production,
whether it’s the clerk
at the grocery store —
when agriculture
gets sick, everybody
feels that kind of pain.
It’s really easy
to be ideological
when both your belly
and your wallet are fat.
But when you’re
broke and hungry,
then you have to be practical.
Mr. President, what I
would tell you is this —
we’ve built these agriculture
markets, for decades —
your tariff rhetoric serves
to only tear those down
and to provide uncertainty
to the market.
You’re going to
make it back, and it’s
going to be made back faster
than anybody would know.
Hope is not a marketing
plan.
Hope is not a business plan,
and I know you know that.
