1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
last month the Republican National
Committee began paying the president's

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,730
personal legal bill stemming from this
investigation into Russian meddling in

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,500
the 2016 election so last month the RNC
actually paid two hundred thirty

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,250
thousand dollars to two of the
president's personal attorneys Jay

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,619
Sekulow and John Dowd via their personal
law firms all of this is coming from the

6
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,199
RNC's own legal fund so not from their
general campaign coffers coffers that go

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,250
to their political activities but of
course this does raise the question

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,079
about the president and why he needs to
go out and seek outside help to pay for

9
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,520
his legal bills the president of course
has claimed the net worth of upwards of

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
ten billion dollars so of course those
questions also beginning to be raised

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,989
Anderson I also understand the orange
tea paid for Donald Trump Jr's illegal

12
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,960
feature for some of them right that's
right Nancy official also telling me

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,370
that Donald Trump jr. his attorneys also
receiving payments from the Republican

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,780
National Committee just this month
nearly two hundred thousand dollars in

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,460
payments and so now Trump jr. is not
only getting his legal bills covered by

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,390
the Trump campaign which has been
previously reported but also now by the

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,689
Republican National Committee and of
course Trump jr. is embroiled in all of

18
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,979
this because of that infamous Trump
Tower meeting last summer during which

19
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,460
he met with an attorney he believed
would provide him with incriminating

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,869
information about Hillary Clinton from
the Russian government so Jared just

21
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:31,140
quickly if it's coming for money from
the campaign is that money being donated

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,259
by just citizens who wanted to donate to
the campaign so that's one thing that

23
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,460
the RNC wants to be very clear about is
that it is coming from this legal fund

24
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,509
that the RNC already has so that's - you
have to actually donate to that

25
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,409
specifically a lot of times what happens
is large donors who come in with the

26
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,950
maximum contribution will donate to
various accounts within the RNC

27
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,189
including the legal fund but small
dollar donors you don't specifically

28
00:01:56,189 --> 00:00:00,000
donate to this fund their money is not
going towards us
