there was that time that I did the show in a moon suit and the time I did it in cat ears there was the time I wore a safari hat there was the time I read the news like a beat poem there was the time my highlighter turned into a lightsaber and the time I won a trophy I'm still a little confused about that there were the dancing flamingos there was the giant whale there was also the rinky-dink xylophone there was that time that we cooked hot dogs in a TV studio there was that time I made my producer deflate a bunch of footballs in the bathroom on live TV I'm still sorry about that we'll there was the time we stuffed a cardboard cutout of a u.s. senator into an envelope there was the one time I pretended to wear a dress literally the one time I've been doing this show for 10 years I still have the same haircut I wear the same $10 blazers I actually still definitely have that blazer in the top left from 2008 I'm telling you this because tomorrow is the 10-year anniversary of this show which means we're really freaking old I mean in cable news years we're like a thousand we're like great Uncle Pete who's always falling asleep and the Thanksgiving mashed potatoes right we are a long thin eel still swimming around New Zealand ready to embark on the next phase of its mysterious fish life after the age of 100 this show has had a kind of 9lives effect over the years there was a big period of time when the top stories in the show were almost always about the tea partier or health care or voting rights there was a stretch when I was completely obsessed with this beauty pageant contestant and the yodeling ventriloquist dummy or the pack of owls attacking people in Salem Oregon we are now of course in a very different phase as a show and also as a country telling you tonight we will not always be in this moment I do not know what comes next but I want to thank you all for being here for all 10 years of it I want to thank everybody who has worked on this show in the last 10 years if it wasn't for you guys the show wouldn't have made it 10 minutes let alone ten years but mostly I want to thank all of you at home for watching thank you for letting us know when you like what we're doing and when you don't I hope you will stick with us through whatever we do next my executive producer now wants me to promise you that I will get some new Blazers but I'm not going to and I probably also will not get a new haircut tears that does a breast fight we'll see you again on Monday hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on YouTube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
