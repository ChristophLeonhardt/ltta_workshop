MILITIAS."
BENJAMIN HALL JOINS US LIVE FROM
JERUSALEM WITH MORE REACTION TO
ME GOOD MORNING THERE, BENJAMIN.
>> GOOD MORNING, SHANNON.
A VERY POLARIZING DECISION BY
PRESIDENT TRUMP.
WORLD LEADERS ALL VERY QUICK TO
REACT ON THIS.
AS YOU SAY COUNTRIES IN THE
REGION VERY SUPPORTIVE IN
GENERAL.
SAUDI ARABIA AND OF COURSE
ISRAEL COMING OUT IN STRONG
SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
DECISION.
AT THE SAME TIME YOU HAVE
EUROPEAN ALLIES SEEMINGLY
CRITICIZING HIS DECISION.
THE FIRST WILL BE THERE TO
ACTUALLY COME OUT AND SPEAK
OPENLY WITH
PRESIDENT PRIME MINISTER
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, IT WAS OF
COURSE HIM THAT LET THE PRESSURE
CAMPAIGN TO PUSH FOR THE U.S. TO
LEAVE THIS DEAL, AND EFFORT WITH
WHICH CULMINATED IN A BIG REVEAL
OF SECRET IRANIAN NUCLEAR FILES.
>> THIS IS WHY ISRAEL THINKS
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID AN
HISTORIC MOVE AND THIS IS WHY
ISRAEL THANKS PRESIDENT TRUMP
FOR HIS COURAGEOUS LEADERSHIP,
HIS COMMITMENT TO CONFRONT THE
TERRORIST REGIME IN TEHRAN.
>> NEXT UP IT WAS PRESIDENT OF
IRAN.
HE INSISTED IRAN WAS NOT
VIOLATING THE DEAL AND SAID
DESPITE THE U.S. DECISION THEY
WOULD STAY IN IT AND CONTINUE TO
TALK TO EUROPE, RUSSIA AND
CHINA.
HE ALSO WARNED IRAN WOULD ALWAYS
PREVAIL.

IT WAS A MULTILATERAL AND
INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT.
>> THERE HAD ALSO BEEN ALL THAT
PRESSURE CAMPAIGNED BY EUROPEAN
LEADERS WHO HAD DONE A LOT OF
TRADE WITH IRAN SINCE THE DEAL
IN 2015 AND TODAY THEY SAID IN A
JOINT STATEMENT THAT THEY
REGRETTED THE PRESIDENT'S
DECISION AND WOULD TRY TO STAY
IN AN IMPROVEMENT.
BOTH THE U.S. AND EUROPE AT ODDS
ON THIS.
INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THAT
PLAYS OUT.
ALSO COMING OUT AND SAYING THAT
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT
STABILITY IN THE REGION BUT
COUNTRIES HERE IN GENERAL IN THE
REGION SUPPORTIVE OF THE
PRESIDENT'S DECISION.

REPORTS ABOUT AN ATTACK IN
SYRIA, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THAT?

THIS HAPPENED JUST WITHIN AN
HOUR OF PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKING
HIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND WE HAVE YET

SYRIAN TV AND WHAT WE GATHER IS
