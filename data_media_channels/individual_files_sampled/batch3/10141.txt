hello and welcome to crosstalk where all things are considered I'm Peter Lavelle is the Middle East stumbling towards a region-wide war it sure looks like it Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal has set into play a cascade of events difficult to manage and control does anyone gain from this impending Cataclysm cross luck in the Middle East I'm joined by my guest Jojo Lori in Washington he's the editor in chief of consortium news.com and author of how I lost by Hillary Clinton with the foreword by Julian Assange also in Washington we have Joe macaron he is a fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC and in London we have Jonathan Steele he's an international affairs commentator all right gentleman crosstalk rules in effect that means he can jump in anytime you want and I always appreciate Joe Lauria let me go to you first in Washington I'm titling this program stumbling into war you know the more I think about the events that are unfolding in front of us there's so many different angles to look at how a possible conflict could come about what worries you the most in the wake of the Trump's decision to walk away from the nuclear deal with Iran go ahead Joe Lauria in Washington what worries me most are two words John and Bolton yes John Bolton the national security adviser has been he's been making speeches and writing articles for years about regime change in Iran he backs this M ek group which was on the Terrorism list State Department's terrorism list he now is in the passenger seat with a very unsteady driver and Netanyahu has one hand on the wheel Netanyahu has been able to manipulate Trump very easily I think like taking candy from a baby with that ridiculous stage performance where he claimed that Iran was restarting their nuclear weapons program they all know except maybe Trump that that's all rubbish that the IAEA has certified that they were they were as complying with the deal this is why there's been so much hysteria in Europe and they tried macron came to Washington Merkel they all failed he pulled out why did he pull out one could only imagine is because they're planning regime change in Iran I think we're seeing all the signs of that you know one hour after Trump made that speech in which he said he was getting out of the deal the Israelis massively bombed Iranian targets inside Syria according to Time magazine one hour later that's the message that was sent so while the attacks me against Iran maybe just in Syria now there's no question in my mind that were the military directive that Trump also gave to this Defense Department to prepare any threat by Iran that we're going down a very very dangerous road here okay it's go to their second Joe in Washington how do you assess what Joe Lauria just said right there because it all of the hallmarks of you know I feel like we're back in 2003 looking at the how the media is dealing with this here I mean the massacre of Palestinians of the last few days and the way the media described it was a conflict as if it was some it was equal to equal sides I mean Joe wrote a great article it's called it's consortium that news US media whitewash is Gaza Gaza Massacre it's perfect title because that's exactly what's happened so Joe what do you think that this is a preamble to some form of regime change in Tehran go ahead Joe I mean I agree with the analysis but I don't agree that we are about to have a regime change in Iran attempt to regime change in Iran or a wider regional confrontation yes there are some hawkish civilians now around Trump they're trying basically to accelerate the attention was Tehran or and the the pressure on Iran there's an attempt basically to create this alliance between the u.s. between Trump Netanyahu and some of the Arab states basically to put a pressure on on Iran and that's the series of steps taken in the past few weeks between the strikes in Syria the nuclear deal the sanctions possible something in Yemen and there at the same time you have elections also in labor and who get who allowed Iran also to flex its muscle somehow in other countries but I don't think we're about we're in 2006 we are not in this there's a high rhetoric on Iran coming out from the top on spaciousness over a year now but the posture on the ground didn't change we then I think things are changing and I think they're changing very rapidly we have the withdrawal the US withdrawing from the nuclear deal we have Hezbollah coming out very well in Lebanon we have a election surprise in Iraq which will we could see auditioning seeing of Iraq from the United States and possibly ran as well but it's a lot more complicated than the media's portraying and a lot of things are happening on the ground let me go to Jonathan Steele in London also I really like the analogy that Joe Lauria gave you know who's got their hand on the driver's steering wheel because we do have it seems patently clear to me that Israel and Saudi Arabia in tandem would really like to see Trump do something of n against Iran I mean they may not do it themselves but they're certainly egging on the president to do it and the rhetoric that's coming out of his administration is just unbelievable I mean it it really it's it's 2003 on steroids to answer our second Joe and watch it and I'm not saying it's gonna happen next week or next month okay but it's they're building towards it look Jonathan in London go ahead well I think Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal for two reasons one was to reimpose sanctions it gave him the excuse to ramp up sanctions not only us sanctions but intimidating the Europeans to cut their dealings with Iran too so it's kind of slow motion colorevolution they want to have they've already had there were big demonstrations earlier in the year in Iran over economic issues mainly and then if they want to you know they want more demonstrations like that they can kill the Iranian economy and get people out into the street they think there's a chance that they can topple Iran through a sort of color revolution the second reason was to provoke if you like the Hawks in Tehran and the course there are folks who never liked the nuclear deal to do something stupid which would give a kind of phony justification for Israel to bomb all the nuclear sites in Iran so I think there's no danger of the u.s. ground invasion of Iran right I think it's this kind of colorevolution provocation and allowing the Israelis to find an excuse to bomb okay Joe Lauria it seems to me that the Europeans are you know beating their chests and making a lot of statements that we have to go on our own and we don't we can't Merkel says we can't look to Washington protect us that's really bluster because they've painted themselves in the corner since the end of the Cold War they've basically defanged themselves castrated themselves we're gonna have to do what the Trump administration wants here what's really interesting to me is what coming out of the White House is that even though the u.s. is Ron they demand that Iran honor the nuclear deal this is really quite amazing well if the Europeans are gonna end up being spineless as we I predict that they will be Iran is gonna start thinking about other options there may be going back starting its program but it has assets in the region that that they can use and they can show that they can push back against the United States in an asymmetrical way this is something I worry about go ahead Joe Lauria and Washington yeah first I agree with what Jonathan said I think they would prefer a regime changed through a color revolution and not war but that's on the cards if necessary as far as the Europeans go we've saw her twice since the Cold War since the end of the Second World War a 1 since 1967 when de Gaulle pulled out of NATO and then of course in 2003 as you were bringing up Peter the Europeans did not vote the Germans and the French were on the Security Council of course the French are always on the Security Council they didn't vote for Bush's a resolution to invade Iraq and that became a big crisis those are the two main times when your showed some independence against United States this is the third opportunity and unfortunately I agree with you and with Alexandre macor√≠s wrote in the Dharana that I republished into sort of news that the market the Iranian market is much smaller than the US market and the economics of it are going to determine that Europe will go along with the u.s. unfortunately although this is an opportunity for Europe in my view which has had until recently anyway the best social system probably ever devised but now it's been under the pressure of neoliberal economics particularly with a guy like Emmanuel macron in France but that this is a chance for Europe to be neutral to be independent to be neutral from both non-aligned if you will between Russia and the US and to lead the way but it's just the will is not there even though they've made a lot of noises about standing up to the US when push comes to shove I think they will cave and it's going to be because of economic reasons and that's very unfortunate ok let's go to the second Joe in Washington I'm gonna stand in thy position that they will cave so that essentially means they're going to abstain okay how is Iran going to react to all this because Jo is already pointed out is and I'm in Jonathan that the hardliners in Tehran are quite probably happy there this is something they didn't like the deal in the first place and and they're gonna have to start thinking in terms of defending themselves because we do have American troops in Iraq in Syria supporting the Saudis in in Yemen and we have I pointed out also Hezbollah is come out on top here in in Lebanon that's a powder keg here so how do you think arounds going to react to all of this it does have some strong cards in its hand it has some weak cards go ahead Joe I mean it has strong cards but I know there are hard riders in in Iran and their hardliners in Washington but so far we don't seek how many basically came out very strong against against the US we didn't see a 2006 a kind of rhetoric so what's happening is there is some kind of Iran u.s. deal sisters are 14 and both Iraq and Lebanon those these are largely still in a place their stock of rotation those counter there's an attempt basically to share power so far the two the two sides didn't change what Trump will change their views what changed now as Trump said I don't want this key nuclear deal as the cornerstone of the tacit understanding with with Iran if Iran doesn't change her regional behavior so I'm gonna take this out and basically go back to the previous order but does it mean that that this kind of sharing power between between the two is not still obvious in Beirut and Baghdad and and other places so as this is why I don't see this rhetoric as very we are on a verge of something big and it's still early days we do have the Iranians on a charmed a tour around the world with the Chinese with the Russians and the Europeans that isn't done yet so we don't know go ahead finish your point no but I mean the issue now is the Americans that the Iranians are not talking to each other so they are talking to each other so the Europeans so both the Americans and the Iranians are pressuring the Europeans now this is why we are in a very crucial weeks now but that doesn't mean that if it's failed of the European stuff it means we're gonna go down the confrontation war I think in the US the mood and the army and the public that want confrontation now but there's okay mature joke I to the pressure force event we go to the break here the u.s. is already threatening the European companies with sanctions okay I don't see any dialogue going on there okay all right gentlemen I'm gonna jump in here hang on we're gonna go to a short break and after that short break we'll continue our discussion on the Middle East stay with our tea welcome back to crosstalk where all things are considered on Peter LaBelle to remind you we're discussing the Middle East okay let's go back to Jonathan and in London quite sadly as these proxy Civil War in Syria's winding down we have more in growing passions it's a in the Middle East here with Trump's decision here how what role do you think Syria is going to play in all of this because Syria is a sovereign government a sovereign state a member of the United Nations has invited Russia and the Iranians in as advisers and more to protect their sovereignty here is this going to be an epicentre here because this is where the Israelis can snipe at the Iranians and they already are doing it and if we have this cooling-off period from this decision that's a trump made because like I pointed out the Iranians are on a charm offensive if they don't get anything out of that Charma offensive they may decide to do other things and do you think that Syria is going to be the epicenter where we could see a a simmering conflict get warmer until it gets hot go ahead Jonathan well I wanted to talk about Iraq in a minute but let me first mention your central question was about Syria I think the danger is that if something happens on the Golan Heights area in southwestern Syria as we've already seen that could escalate and then Hezbollah could come in with its massive amount of rockets in southern Lebanon and that is the big danger if Israel provokes and gets the response that it may in fact want to have if it wants a war with Lebanon then that could be very dangerous for the region but I think it's important to talk about Iraq because again really very important developments have happened there it's one of the best pieces of good news for Iraq in in several years is the victory of moqtada al-sadr in the election I mean he is a nationalist he's very anti Iran he's very anti the u.s. he stands for non intervention by either of those two countries in his country Iraq that's really important and the paradox is that you may actually get secret talks between the Iranians and the Americans to try and prevent moqtada al-sadr having the real choice of who becomes the next Iraqi Prime Minister I think both Tehran and Washington would like haider al-abadi the president prime minister to carry all they will work their way through these back door negotiations to form a new cabinet so you could actually have cooperation although it won't be admitted publicly between Tehran and Washington over the future of Iraq that's a very good point Jonathan let me go to Joe Lauria here not nominally and under normal circumstances I would completely agree with Jonathan but I think in the wake of Trump's decision there is a trust deficit and that's saying something because the United States and Iran have had enormous amounts of distrust ever since 1979 revolution here but I don't see the Iranians wanted doing the Americans any favors right now they the Americans have dug themselves the deepest of possible holes when it comes to Iraq and Afghanistan here so this could be more of a bargaining chip for the Iranians and in some fashion or another go ahead Joe Lauria in Washington yeah first to put it on the record neither Peter nor I said we're on the verge of a war no yes I'm not saying that I'm not saying you asked her yeah you're right no no I'm just going back to what we talked before and also your question was never answer about what Iran might do the head of the excuse me its nuclear program Sally he said I think today I'm sorry yeah on Tuesday he said that they would start to to enrich again stronger than before was the words he used now as far as whether the Iranians I think Jonathan has a point there because it's not just doing the Americans a favor they don't want moqtada al-sadr to have power in Iran in Iraq either because that would all possibly diminish Iran's influence in Iraq so they do they would have a common ground to work and don't forget even right after the 1979 revolution in Iran Ronald Reagan worked with Iran in the iran-contra scandal so there's nothing just precluded in realpolitik though we have john bolton who's an ideologue of course a neocon so that may or may not happen but it's something to consider that Iraq would be a problem for both countries but that would not stop the drive towards regime change in Iran even if they cooperate Iran Iraq it's good as a second Joe in in Washington you know with the the paradox here is that there is no evidence that the Iranians really had a serious nuke weapons program but they signed the deal for for sanctions relief the IAEA certified that they were in compliance of course then we have trumpets as it was the worst deal in history and they withdrawal from it now it looks like the Iranians may possibly return to firing up their centrifuges I mean the then they'll say look they're going after the bomb I mean you can't win for losing in this type of logic here and then throw in the Saudis saying well we'll go for the bomb - I mean the administration did not and I used the word cascade effect in my introduction this is what's happening we could have an arms race here alright and then we already have a nuclear power in the Middle East and that's named Israel here I mean before we didn't have that we a weeks a week ago two weeks ago we didn't see the possibility of an arms race now we do go ahead Joe in Washington I mean I know we are caught up at the moment now with the with all the stocks but I don't see we're going down this this trajectory I don't say I ran is has has doesn't need a nuclear weapon at this point it never asked for it this was part of this negotiation to be on the table with with the international powers now that's an attempt to change this dynamic but Iran is basically comfortable and where they are now in Syria and Iraq and Lebanon and they don't need to go into regional confrontation or oriented to trigger a nuclear race as you mentioned I agree with you I agree with you I mean I think the Iranians are happy with the status quo it's the rhetoric that's coming out of Washington that threatens that status quo and if I were in in Tehran I would start reacting to this kind of bombastic ideologically driven aggression you know have people like Bolton okay I'm not worried about what the Iranian you know the Revolutionary Guards are saying I'm more worried about what John Bolton is saying go ahead Joe it's an empty rhetoric this one year you have Michael Flynn on the Stone the body of saying we put Iran on notice all this empty rhetoric so far the dynamic you the US French American the British strike that even get close to Iran did if I'd get close to anything that's moving no no this is this I'm sorry I mean remember the rhetoric of 2003 Joe that was that this words and guess who was around joke John Bolton was around so I tend to have a memory here and so does the region the foot of the world change the us change Bolton's mindset change no it hasn't I agree with much importance it's not that important it's better not it's better not to underestimate people like that and the other people Mike Pompeo these other people that are surrounding Trump here you know let me go to it Jonathan here go you want to react to this here go ahead well I think I tend to other to agree that one shouldn't overdo the the rhetoric thing there's a big step between rhetoric and action and of course these are hardliners they would love to see a different regime in Tehran but the question is how are they going to achieve it so I come back to my first point I think they're in a slow-motion regime change agenda not a fast motion one they want color revolution they want to collapse of the economy they want sanctions to bite and they want Israel to keep putting the military pressure on the table but they're willing to wait two three five years maybe they're not coming in tomorrow okay Joe you were disagreeing earlier I'd like to put in a caveat here he said they after this charm offensive that I've mentioned already twice I don't think it's gonna come to anything here but the Iranians do have the opportunity to turn to China in Russia and and Russia has certainly been interested in that the Chinese is well I mean the Iran was just gonna have to completely give up on the West we I'd like to remind our viewers you know opinion polls global opinion polls year after year Iranians are quite pro-american that is changing right now as the population go ahead Joe well first of all we're not just seeing rhetoric seeing action he pulled out of this nuclear deal which is the absolutely absolutely worst thing that Trump has done he's done many stupid things this is by far the worse the most dangerous thing he did this is action I agree with Jonathan that they prefer a regime change by overthrowing the government but with some groups on the ground that they could control or influence rather than going to war there's no doubt about that but they have not taken I think war off the table there's no timetable here three to five years maybe too long Trump may be gone in two years there's going to be an election so uh this is extremely dangerous situation right here as far as China goes there's an interesting article in The Washington Post they very interesting the way it ended it's explained how China is just ignoring all these threats from the US and they're going to continue of course to trade with Iran because they don't trade in dollars for one thing and they're going to avoid American financial institutions to try to evade some kind of sanctions and that Europe in fact may want to work with China as a middleman to continue to work with Iran I'm not sure that would would work or how would work but the article ended by saying the u.s. may be the country that finds itself being isolated itself rather than isolating Iran so China does play a huge role in this and I think we have to look at that in terms of how these sanctions might be evaded and the penalties that the u.s. might try to put on Europe I think still think that could happen even if they trade through China they might find that say Airbus or other companies right if they continue to sell their wares to to Iran well Germany's Siemens has already come out they've caved they're afraid of the US Treasury here let me let me go to our second Joe here how much does Riyadh in Tel Aviv Drive all of this I mean you know I've used the word charm many times in this program but I mean Trump seems so very charmed by the Saudis and by Bibi Netanyahu go ahead Joe I mean what I said there's an attempt to do this alliance between between the US and Israel and Saudi Arabia as well the u.s. goes back to traditional allies the interesting part is the Saudis and is Radia doesn't don't care much about the declare D they they care about deterring Iran and they want has to do it not themselves mostly but the u.s. is mostly focused on the real deal at this point Netanyahu is using this this car basically to take a green light to a lot from the US so basically do some L stock against against Israel which is by the way approved by by both the US and and Russia those s track because that happened and then following Netanyahu visit we didn't say Russia agreed brush you might not be able to do anything about it there's a big difference between the two okay going last word here 10 seconds show last word for you know I mean the the last point is I don't think we're going in the confrontation now there's still attempt to deter Iran or on or on very wide level okay it might be a tense period for the coming weeks but I think it is a very tense period and I think it's only gonna get worse because we don't have leadership in the world right now in either real leadership in the US or in Europe it's gonna fall in the model Middle East that's it gentlemen many thanks to my guests in Washington in London and thanks to our viewers for watching us here at RT see you next time and remember Rostock rules
