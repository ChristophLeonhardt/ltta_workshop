Can you imagine 24 hours
without heartburn?
>> Shannon: THIS IS A FOX NEWS
ALERT.
PRIMARY RESULTS ARE COMING IN
FROM ARKANSAS, KENTUCKY, TEXAS
AND GEORGIA.
GAINESVILLE, GEORGIA, TONIGHT
WERE ALL EYES ARE ON AN INTENSE
GOVERNOR'S RACE.
WE WILL START THERE.
HELLO, JONATHAN.
>> HIGH MATT, SHANNON.
RIGHT NOW I'M AT THE WATCH PARTY
FOR CASEY CAGLE, A LEADING
CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE.
YOU CAN SEE THEY ARE CLEARING
OUT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IT WAS A
VERY GOOD NIGHT FOR THEM.
CASEY CAGLE COMING IN FIRST IN A
FIVE WAY RACE IN THE G.O.P.
PRIMARY FOR THE GEORGIA
GOVERNORSHIP.
HOWEVER, NOT ABLE TO PASS THE
50% THRESHOLD HE WOULD HAVE
NEEDED TO AVOID A RUNOFF IN
JULY.
I SPOKE WITH HIM ABOUT THAT JUST
MOMENTS AGO.
>> WE FELT ALL ALONG THAT WE
WOULD BE IN A RUNOFF.
THIS WAS A VERY CONTESTED
PRIMARY WITH A LOT OF PLAYERS IN
THE RACE.
IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT AND IT
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE TO MY
KNOWLEDGE TO GET TO 50 PLUS ONE.
BUT WITHIN THAT CONTEXT OUR
STRATEGY REALLY IS TO CONTINUE
TO CARRY OUR MESSAGE ACROSS
GEORGIA.
>> ON JULY 24, HE WILL FACE A
RUNOFF AGAINST GEORGIA SECRETARY
OF STATE BRIAN KEMP WHO PLACED
SECOND AS STATEWIDE
OFFICEHOLDERS BOTH OF THEM
ENJOYED THE STRONGEST NAME
RECOGNITION AMONG THE FIVE
G.O.P. CONTENDERS.
WITH ONLY TWO CANDIDATES IN THE
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY THAT CONTEST
WAS SETTLED TONIGHT AND IT WAS
SETTLED DECISIVELY.
FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE
STACY ABRAMS WINNING BY A
LANDSLIDE OVER STATE
REPRESENTATIVE STACY EVANS.
BOTH STACYS HAD SIMILAR
PLATFORMS BUT DIFFERENT CAMPAIGN
STRATEGIES.
STACY EVANS TRIED TO BRING
SUBURBANITES AND WORKING-CLASS
VOTERS BACK INTO THE DEMOCRATIC
FOLD BUT IT WAS STACY ABRAMS'
DOOR-TO-DOOR EFFORTS TO RECRUIT
NEW VOTERS.
LIBERAL LEANING YOUNG PEOPLE AND
MINORITIES THAT SEEM TO HAVE
PAID OFF.
OTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WILL
LIKELY TAKE NOTE OF THIS AS THEY
HEAD INTO THE MIDTERMS AND 2020
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
IF SHE WERE TO WIN BACK THE
GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER,
ABRAMS WOULD BECOME THE FIRST
FEMALE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA AND
THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN
FEMALE GOVERNOR OF ANY U.S.
STATE.
DEMOCRATS DO FACE AN UPHILL
BATTLE IN STATEWIDE ELECTIONS IN
GEORGIA.
AFTER ALL, GEORGIA REMAINS A
STRONGLY RED STATE, BUT WITH
G.O.P. RUNOFF COMING UP IN JULY,
TWO COAT REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES
ALSO HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR
