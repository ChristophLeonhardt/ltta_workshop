in Germany almost 2000 people identified as far-right extremists of a permit to possess a firearm it's according to the government's own statistics 1,200 of that number described themselves as Reich citizens and since November of 2016 around 450 of them have had their firearms licenses taken off them by the state but who are Reich citizens and are they dangerous Reich citizen is a catch-all term for a loosely affiliated bunch who claim that the Federal Republic of Germany is illegitimate and say that the pre-war vimar Constitution remains in effect that's the same system that allowed adult Hitler to take power well today's Reich citizen groups come in several shapes and sizes but almost all of them have some link to either neo-nazi groups or far-right ideology their historical revisionism forms an ideological link that connects various right-wing extremist currents and right-wing extremists among Reich citizens use those connections to cause confusion to provoke authorities and to create a social platform for right-wing ideology it's estimated that there's around 18,000 of these Reich citizens in Germany some are allegedly preparing for a day X when they'll rise up and take their country back but these aren't just hollow empty threats eighteen months ago a policeman in Bavaria was killed during a shootout between officers and a member of one of these Reich citizens groups the number of these people has significantly significantly increased acts of violence towards public officials policemen have increased in number if the numbers go on to increase if these people really use terms and prepare themselves for opposing and resisting public authorities then indeed it's a challenge for the state opposition politicians have accused the governments of trying to sweep the extent of Germany's problem with far-right violence under the rug first the federal government explains that right-wing terrorist groups can form spontaneously and have a strong digital network but then many of their actions are not counted as right-wing terror offenses the impression is that the federal government consciously accepts blind spots in the recent past berlin hasn't pulled away from publishing intelligence findings that showed as many as 700 radical Islamists could be in the country and a capable of preparing a terrorist attack but it does seem that they're less forthcoming when that threat it's potentially posed from elsewhere we now are facing at the end of less being intellectual dominance and cultural and political hegemony and under this umbrella of drug right-wing populism of course right-wing radicals right wing extremists feel protected the German state has directions to that with all the power and strength it has Germany has very strict gun control laws thankfully gun deaths are a rare occurrence here but perhaps one way to keep it that way would be to not allow people who the government considers they threat to the public to have access to firearms Peter Oliver RT Berlin you
