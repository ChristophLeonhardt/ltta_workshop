you've said though that if you did run for president you believed you'd win I wouldn't go into lose I've never gone into losing life I think people are tired of seeing the United States ripped off I am officially running for president of the United States and we are going to make our country great again Donald Trump's presidential campaign has been the most spectacular political story of the year I would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me believe me his speech highlighted his net worth his real estate holdings and the fact that America needs a leader who was not a loser our polling shows you have an uphill fight 71 percent unfavorable I don't wear a toupee it's my year a new poll out today shows Donald Trump's favorability spiking among Republican voters at first the campaign was seen as a joke yet another stunt by a master of media then Trump soared in the polls now proving the skeptics wrong the new york tyke hoon is still on top well into November so we hit the trail with Trump to see the phenomenon for ourselves so why are you here tonight I want to see somebody that actually represents middle America citizens for a change everybody thought it was a joke we also interviewed Trump in his office sound on cameras off Congress doesn't work for you you can't fire them so how do you get things done I've been dealing with politicians all my life and I've always gotten him to do what I needed to do our goal on the trail was to answer three questions why do people like Trump what would he do as president and can he win he may go down as one of the greatest presidents in history that's how confident I am Trump is a one of a kind once in a generation maybe once in a lifetime political story there is a movement going on folks I hate to tell you we're here at the Springfield Illinois Convention Center they just opened the doors for the Trump rally tonight everyone is very excited as soon as they open the doors folks charged right up to hear the podium they want to be right in the front I have to say this is my first political rally ever I'm excited everywhere we went in town today folks know mr. Trump is speaking tonight people excited and tagging istic it's the whole Trump thing he brings out the emotions in people and they are excited for tonight in the final moments before Trump enters pavarotti's Aria hits its crescendo at dawn I will win I will win I will win and the next president of the United States Donald Trump then an abrupt musical change as Twisted Sister takes over when Trump first jumped in the polls pundits predicted a quick crash but months later he's still on a roll more than 10,000 people have flocked to this sold-out stadium most of course are Trump supporters so how come you're here tonight and why is that so exciting that you would actually come and give your evening to Trump so why are you here because I believe in almost everything Donald Trump says and I'm no stupidity I've got a genius IQ highest to the moon and back I'm here to see it presidential candidate actually talked for once I haven't seen any of them and so long and it's a pleasure to finally see someone actually come down to Springfield and represent Illinois and so you think he can win I do I do and I hope he does of course this is Donald Trump so there are strong feelings on both sides and you sir Donald Trump is running for president what a time to be alive why do you say that because it there comes a point in a failing democracy when you know if this man is leading in the polls there has to be a problem and same for you why are you here you're here to laugh at him yeah really entertaining okay the latest polls show Trump tied for first in the Republican field with another non politician ben Carson the establishment candidates the politicians are way behind and that's one thing Trump supporters love about him he's not a politician they're sick of politicians and who are these supporters overall they are men white and young who make less than $50,000 a year perhaps surprisingly given some of his recent remarks Trump also has strong support among women Donald Trump supporters are not your typical Republican they're a little less well educated and they have somewhat lower incomes they are also some of the ones who are most dissatisfied with politics as its exists in the United States today in our week on the trail with Trump we met many of these folks our first stop Trump's book signing in New York City crippled America details his complaints about the country his vision for making it great again Business Insider's Brett Lowe Jurado was there how long have you been in line here I've been here since 4:00 a.m. we got here about a little after 6:00 I came from Wisconsin first of all I'm a big Trump supporter I think he will make a great president what do you think he'll make a great president because he's very smart why do I support Trump because he's not a politician he's a businessman Donald Trump gives us the same kind of a feeling or at least gives me the same kind of a feeling that I had when Ronald Reagan was elected then it was on to New Hampshire where Trump came to file to run in the nation's first primary this was a symbolic flourish vintage Trump my slogan make America great again that's what we're going to do make America great again that's the headline I like New York Times that's what I like more in GOP see Trump as winner poll finds I think what Trump is has tuned into or plugged himself into is even bigger than Trump the system needs shaken up and Trump is the man with the energy and dynamism to do it he's like over the top with his bursting amount of energy and he's like a breath of fresh air another thing Trump supporters like about him is that they think he tells it like it is his mouth is one of his greatest strengths and greatest liabilities he says things that are funny and standard campaign fare these politicians they run and they run and they win and sometimes they lose and they keep running that's all they do is run it's possible that because of this deal made by secretary Kerry who has absolutely no clue how to negotiate I would repeal and replace the big lie Obamacare he also says things that are mean insulting and disrespectful such as this comment about Senator John McCain's he's a war hero because he was captured I like people that weren't captured okay I hate to tell you you've called women you don't like fat pigs dogs slobs and disgusting animals your Twitter account only Rosie O'Donnell when Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best they're not sending you they're not sending you they're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us they're bringing drugs they're bringing crime they're rapists and some I assume are good people these statements would do most candidates but so far they mostly seem to reinforce the idea that Trump is the only one who says what he really thinks so is Donald Trump just a showman and professional provocateur or is he serious about leading this country perhaps both he's got such a huge need for attention and he has these sort of coinciding agendas one is the development of his business and commercial interests which run on publicity and the other is his genuine dislike of President Obama and his real belief that the country's a mess Trump has been saying that America is a mess America's being humiliated they're killing us since 1987 the country's love/hate view of Trump came into focus with his controversial appearance that weekend as host of Saturday Night Live we have got a great show tonight SIA is here the show got panned by critics but it had record ratings it also got picketed by protesters they lined up for hours in advance marching from Trump Tower to Rockefeller Plaza they're hurtful they're hateful and they're in facing incredible acts of hatred and other sentiments of racism that's not what America is about I'm definitely not a rapist I'm not a criminal I work hard for a living we need to remember that United States was built by immigrants and allowing this people to continue creating the hate towards our community it just created a division in the American Society at Charlie Parker's diner in Springfield Illinois we heard these contrasting views of trumps outspokenness I questioned whether a presidential candidate to talk about somebody's appearance their personal issues I don't think that's very presidential that's my biggest problem with Donald Trump okay it reminds me of a junior high boy I think he legit wants to offer something to you know us as a nation and you know that's just the way he does it he's brutally honest and kind of a butthole and that's just what he does some people are honest and stay to the point and other people beat around the bush he just not the bush beater Trump definitely doesn't beat around the bush but he also often doesn't sound or act presidential for example Trump is now suing many American companies he's taking Starbucks to task for not having Merry Christmas written on its holiday cups I have one of the most successful Starbucks in Trump Tower maybe we should boycott Starbucks I don't know seriously I don't care he threatened did never eat another Oreo because Nabisco's building a plant in Mexico tonight in the play they had Oreos that may be the last made in this country but I wouldn't eat them anyway because the threat is there he blasts t-mobile on Twitter because its CEO once tweaked him we generally like our presidents to be well presidential we really want to elect a president who even supporters described as quote kind of a butthole I think he speaks to a lot of the frustrations especially in the heartland of America especially disadvantaged people blue-collar people people that felt like the Conservatives but been left by the wayside the Republican Party I think Donald Trump speaks at this dissatisfaction that frustration which is ironic as you have you know bukhara boys from the backwoods supporting this rich mogul from New York but that's how frustrated people are how much they want to change and you think Trump can actually make think you will win he's interested in this country and helping everybody in the country because right now that we need the economy moving and we need jobs and I think he might take care of that problem I grew up in New York City so I've been immersed in Donald Trump all my life Trump has always been seen as a guy who can get things done that's perhaps the thing that voters are most excited about him it's also something that I have always admired about him Trump's first big book was called the art of the deal I read it when I was in college one part I've always remembered his Trump story about fixing a disaster of a skating rink in Central Park the city had been trying to fix this ring Wollman Rink for years they just couldn't do it the project was an embarrassment way behind schedule way over budget Trump made a deal with the city to fix the rink in a short time with little money he did what the bureaucrats couldn't Trump also built a bunch of buildings you can see from right here Trump Tower Trump Park Trump Hotel and Tower Trump place is only a few blocks over even those who don't like Trump have to admit that he can make things happen I really aren't the deal 1987 that's very inspiring actually the anecdote has always stuck with me which is Wollman Rink yeah where you said I asked myself who knows how to make ice rinks right Canada they spent eight years I did it in three months and and most of the money I spent was to rip everything they did it for Trump's can-do reputation is the biggest part of his appeal Washington has been gridlocked for years voters from both parties are fed up with it the idea that an outsider could come in and get things done is exciting I've been doing this all my life I've been making deals on my life all over the world I have jobs all over the world whether it's you know you can take a look at anything zoning the west side rail yard 6000 units on the west side everyone said you got to be kidding you'll never get it I got it so easy give and take because the problem in Washington right now is it's just it's give and take but it's got to be mostly take because you can't give you got to get a mostly take but it's you make deals Trump is just willing to ask he's willing to demand the things that other people won't so Trump supporters think he can get things done but what would he actually do according to polls Trump's biggest strengths with voters are number one the economy and number two illegal immigration Trump is often criticized for not offering specifics about what he would do as president well I read his book and there are lots of specifics in here interestingly the book also shows that some of trumps views will appeal to members of both parties Trump is a hawk on immigration military power and gun rights positions that conservatives love but he also wants to rebuild America's infrastructure and keep Social Security and Medicare this mix of views is unusual it suggests that if Trump wins the nomination he could potentially appeal to enough independents and Democrats to actually win the general election but Trump's fiery rhetoric and his love of attacking those who criticize him unnerve moderates of both parties here's Trump's own radio ad for example touting his plan to crush Isis Donald Trump will protect Israel and doodlee and quickly cut the head off of Isis and here's Trump on China China is a tremendous abuser of the United States I said the other day in the history of the world there has never been a greater theft than what the United States has you know we have we've been taken care of by China and on the biggest lightning rod issue of all Trump's plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants and when people come in they have little families each other gonna deport each other no no we're gonna keep the families together we have to keep the families together you're gonna have to go for those who think Trump would be a pragmatic president the deportation plan is a head shaker leaving aside fairness and feasibility it's impractical it would at best take years and cost billions and how about military Trump's instinct is to attack anybody who criticizes him as president he would be able to back up his words with the most powerful weapons and troops on the planet would president Trump overlook slights that candidate Trump won't will he use this power wisely seeing other countries is the root of America's problems is nothing new for Trump oh the Japanese for the bad guys in the 1980s now it's the Chinese who are the bad guys and the Mexicans are the bad guys it's really for Trump about the dynamic of blaming someone else and pitting America against a foreign power and in that way it's a little easier for him than a candidate who goes head-to-head with the Democrats all you have to do is ask Israel the wall works believe me the last stop on our Trump campaign trail was the GOP debate in Milwaukee they've gotten rich off of us now we're in Wisconsin for the fourth Republican debate obviously a very different night than last night last night Donald Trump and his team controlled the entire show from beginning to end in raucous environment there's lots of alcohol sir credibly loud and boisterous with trump's music this is gonna be very different our taxes are too high I've come up with a tax plan that many many people like very much Trump at is so so nice all of his debates have been so-so Donald Trump is strongest when he's the center of attention in the debates Trump has to share the stage with the establishment candidates who sometimes sound smarter and better informed than he does trump's renegade political views and outsider status don't go over well with the powers that be in American politics that's a big reason why top political analyst Nate Silver puts Donald Trump's chance of winning even with his recent success at only 10 percent or less if you look back at history you've never seen candidates like Donald Trump certainly or Ben Carson win a party nomination and secondly if you look at the polling a lot of times a candidate it's the establishments game you're playing on their turf they control all sorts of things from delegate selection process indeed the party nomination isn't about overall popularity it's a state-by-state contest for delegates and each state's rules are different some like Florida or winner-take-all others split them up in the case of Iowa in particular because of the complicated caucus rules it's very important to have a well organized ground campaign instead of boots on the ground Trump is rallying supporters largely via mail in post cards but to have a chance of winning pundits say Trump will eventually have to get the Republican establishment behind him so one key question is whether he will be able to do that political analyst said at some point you're gonna have to hug and make up with Karl Rove and the establishment I maybe I will I can do that too I can make up with you establish look the establishment doesn't want me because I don't need the establishment Trump makes a big deal about how he's not beholding to the powers that be and his fans love that about him I don't need anybody's money I'm using my own money I'm not using the lobbyists I'm not using donors I don't care I'm really rich I'll share that I said but presidential campaigns cost a lot of money and for now the big money is backing other candidates early on most of the bigger Republican donors back Jeb Bush lately Marco Rubio just got a big win when Paul singer one of the biggest Republican billionaire donors decided to back him and singer said that Rubio was the only candidate who could beat Hillary Clinton in a general election Donald Trump's greatest strengths are his pragmatism in his charisma he's a brilliant businessman who can get things done he's also a brilliant entertainer when he uses those talents for good they enable him to do things that most people would consider impossible when he uses them for bad however he brings out the worst in himself and in the country with less than three months to go before the first votes are cast most pundits still think Trump's ride will soon come to an end Trump meanwhile still thinks he's a winner I love you all thank you we will make America great again thank you stay tuned is the greatest political story of the year continues to unfold the prism through which we cover him and approach him yeah that's been shattered I stopped making any predictions because I realized that he was going to defy all of these rules partly because he learned from television partly because he has skills as an entertainer he is a one-of-a-kind candidate
