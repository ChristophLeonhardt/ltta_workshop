AND CANDANCE OWENS AND GREG GUTFELD. 5 O'CLOCK IN NEW YORK CITY AND THIS IS "THE FIVE." IT'S THE STORY SENDING THE COUNTRY INTO A FRENZY AND SPARKING WIDESPREAD CONVERSATIONS. THE PRESIDENT HAS IT. WHAT? KANYE WEST HAS IT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? DRAGON ENERGY. NO, STOP, GROSS. INSTEAD OF FOCUSSING ON REAL ISSUES IMPACTING RACE, WE ARE FOCUSSING ON KANYE WEST WHO SAID IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYTHING OF SUBSTANCE. ALL OF A SUDDEN WITH A RECORD COMING UP, HE LIKED DONALD TRUMP. WHEN THE PRESIDENT BRAGS ABOUT THE THINGS HE DID FOR BLACK PEOPLE. KANYE WEST DIDN'T REPRESENT BLACK PEOPLE. THIS MAN HAS BEEN LOST FOR YEARS. THE AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE PREDOMINANTLY DEMOCRATS. I THINK KANYE WEST LOST HIS MIND. I THINK IT'S WEIRD. I LOVE IT. EVEN ASKED SARAH SANDERS ABOUT IT AT THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS MEETING. KANYE WEST EXPRESSED HIS ADMIRATION FOR THE PRESIDENT. COVERING ALL RANGE OF TOPICS. HAS THE PRESIDENT REACHED OUT TO KANYE WEST AND WOULD HE MEET AT THE WHITE HOUSE? THEY MET DURING THE TRANSITION. THAT'S THE ONLY MEETING I AM AWARE OF OR CONVERSATION BEFORE EVERYBODY HAS A MELTDOWN. PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO WEIGHING IN THIS WEEK. HE SEES THAT STUFF AND HE IS SMART. HE SAID TRUMP IS DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB THAN THE DEMOCRATS. PRESIDENT TRUMP COMMENTED AGAIN TODAY ON KANYE WEST: THEY REALLY GET IT. THIS STARTED WITH ONE 7-WORD TWEET LAST SATURDAY. I LOVE THE WAY CANDACE OWENS THINK." THAT COULD LEAD TO A CULTURE SHIFT. "THE FIVE" HAS AN INTERESTING UPDATE. CANDACE PREDICTED THIS WOULD HAPPEN OVER A YEAR AGO. I FIRST SAID IF YOU UNDERSTOOD KANYE WEST AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE MOVEMENT OF DONALD TRUMP. PEOPLE CAN'T CORRELATE THAT. IT'S SIMILAR. ANTI-POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. CANDACE JOINING US TODAY. WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOU AND WITH SPEAK WITH YOU. WE HAVE BEEN HEARING THIS CHATTER. YOU PREDICTED THIS AND NOW YOU HAVE BECOME PART OF THIS CULTURE SHIFT? THAT'S RIGHT. I COULD BE BIASSED. I LOVE THE WAY CANDACE OWENS THINKS AS WELL. THIS IS BIZARRE. I KNEW IT WOULD BE KANYE WEST THAT WOULD BREAK THROUGH THIS GROUP THOUGHT ON THE LEFT. WHAT HE ADVOCATES THE MOST FOR IN HIS MUSIC IS INDEPENDENCE. TO BE A CONSERVATIVE MEANS YOU ALLOW INDEPENDENT THINKING. THEY DON'T ALLOW THAT ON THE LEFT WHATSOEVER. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF AN INTERESTING TIME IN BLACK AMERICA. GREG, WHEN THIS FIRST HAPPENED, SOMETHING IS GOING ON HERE. THIS IS A CULTURE SHIFT. YOU DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS A PUBLICITY STUNT? PEOPLE WILL CALL YOU A HYPOCRITE WHEN CELEBRITIES TALK POLITICS AND YOU TELL THEM TO SHUT UP. YOU ARE AN ACTOR, JUST ACT. THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS COMES WITH A COST TO HIS REPUTATION AND FAN BASE AND ALBUM SALES. WHEN PEOPLE SAY HE IS DOING THIS TO PROMOTE ALBUM SALES, THIS IS GOING TO HURT HIM! HE DIDN'T CHOOSE A TYPICAL CUDDLY ISSUE LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR BULLYING OR GUN CONTROL. HE CHOSE THE MOST HARMFUL ISSUE. THE MOST DIVISIVE ISSUE PUTTING HIS ARMS AROUND PRESIDENT TRUMP. THAT TAKES A LOT OF GUTS. YOU ARE SEEING A CHANGE IN THE INTELLECTUAL DARK WEB. ADAMS AND ROGUE AN. PEOPLE ARE SEEKING ANOTHER PLACE TO FIND THE TRUTH BECAUSE THEY ARE TIRED OF THE NARRATIVE. I THINK IS PART OF THAT. I THINK YOU OVER-STATE. I TRIED TO OVER-STATE IT. . YOU ARE OVER-STATING SOMETHING. THAT'S WHAT I AM AFRAID OF IT. I COP TO THAT. THE FACT IS PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT 8% OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE WHICH WAS A BIT OF A SPIKE FROM WHAT MITT ROMNEY GOT 6%. RACE IS POLITICS AND POLITICS IS RACE IN THIS COUNTRY. VAN JONES FROM CNN SAID ON ELECTION NIGHT, THIS WAS WHITE-LASH. IT WAS ON ONE SIDE AND PEOPLE OF RECALL ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE FEROCITY OF THE REACTION OF KANYE WEST'S SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND YOU CANDACE IS A MEASURE OF THAT. ROMNEY WAS AT 6% AND TRUMP AT 8%. IF YOU GO TO 10% FOR A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE NATIONALLY, THAT BRINGS ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF COUNTIES IN PLAY. WITH THE COUNTRY DIVIDED, THAT RAZOR MARGIN COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. WHAT SHOW DID YOU DO, CANDACE? BEFORE KANYE WEST TWEETED ME, IT WAS "WATTERS WORLD." I WANTED TO ESTABLISH THAT. . AND FOR JUAN WILLIAMS, I AM SORRY. I WISH HE WERE TODAY. I PUT A HURT ON HIM. HE IS STILL RECOVERING. I WOULD SAY ONE THING, I THINK KANYE WEST AND DONALD TRUMP HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON BESIDES THE DRAGON ENERGY. THEY BOTH THRIVE ON CONTROVERSY. BOTH ARE EGOTISTICAL. BOTH ARE LOVED AND HATED. THEY DRIVE THEIR SUPPORTERS CRAZY BUT ALSO MAKE THEIR SUPPORTERS DANCE. HE SAID THIS IS NOT POLITICAL, KANYE WEST. HE SAID IT'S NOT ABOUT REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRATS. IT'S ABOUT INDEPENDENT THOUGHT. I AGREE WITH THAT. I DON'T THINK HE IS TALKING ABOUT THE BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT OR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT TRUMP HAS DONE FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY. IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE POLICY, I DON'T THINK TRUMP HAS HURT AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN IN COUNTRY. YOU LOOK AT FOOD STAMPS ARE DOWN. SHOOTINGS ARE DOWN IN CHICAGO AND BLACK UNEMPLOYMENT. THINGS ARE NOT TERRIBLE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY AS A RESULT OF DONALD TRUMP'S POLICY. THERE IS A REAL THING CALLED DRAGON ENERGY. IT IS REAL. TRUMP IS A MOTIVE STAR. KANYE WEST IS A MOVIE STAR. THERE ARE OTHERS. . PRESIDENT TRUMP DURING THE CAMPAIGN DID SOME THINGS THAT REALLY WERE EGREGIOUS FROM THE POINT OF FEW FROM AFRICAN-AMERICANS. NAME 1. WHEN HE FEIGNED IGNORANCE OF DAVID DUKE. I DON'T KNOW DAVID DUKE. I HAVE TO RESEARCH IT. IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, THE NEO-NAZI MARCH, HE EQUATED THE 2 SIDES. THE EXTREME LEFT WITH THE EXTREME RIGHT. 100%. I SAID TO THE PRESIDENT, FACE-TO-FACE THAT I THOUGHT HE NEEDED TO REACH OUT. I LOOKED AROUND AND EVERYBODY IN MAR-A-LAGO WAS WHITE. I SAID YOU NEED BLACK FACES HERE. THAT'S A REALITY. HE HAS TO FACE IT. THERE IS A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM WITH RACE AND POLITICS IN IN COUNTRY. DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE HAS DRAGON ENERGY AND IS THIS INDEPENDENCE THINKER HAS THE ABILITY TO BUST OUT OF THAT 8%. CANDACE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. IN TERMS OF THE CULTURE SHIFT. MINORITY WOMEN AND CONSERVATIVE WOMEN LIKE YOURSELF AND MYSELF TAKE OFFENSE IS CULTURE ELITE TELLING US WHAT TO THINK AND BELIEVE. WHETHER WE ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK OR WE ARE DELIRIOUS TO SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICANS. KANYE WEST IS PUSHING BACK AGAINST THAT POLARIZING THINKING THAT TRIES TO PUT PEOPLE IN BOXES AND STIGMATIZE YOU. IT'S MONOLITHIC THINKING. THAT'S WHAT I AM PUNCHING BACK AGAINST. AT THE END OF THE DAY IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. WHEN YOU SAY HE NEEDS TO HAVE MORE BLACK FACES. THAT MEANS NOTHING. WE SAW WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE HAD EVERY BLACK ARTIST IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR PHOTO-OPES AND CHICAGO WAS WORSE OFF. I NEED TO SEE BLACK RESULTS. IT'S INSULTING PEOPLE SAY WE HAVE BEYONCE AND JAY-Z ON STAGE. THAT'S AN UPHILL CHALLENGE. . THAT'S TRUE. YOU CAN SEE THAT WITH THE RECORD LEVEL OF INCARCERATIONS OF BLACK AMERICANS. THERE ARE POINTS TO BE MADE HERE TO SUPPORT THESE THEORIES. WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY, THERE IS A GROUP THINK TRYING TO POLLUTE YOUR MIND AND DIDN'T RESPECT FREEDOM OF THOUGHT OR EXPRESSION.
