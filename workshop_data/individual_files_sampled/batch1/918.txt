hello I'm handsome seeker this is counting the cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week a trade war a real war and rising debt levels why the IMF and the World Bank are warning about risks to the global economy also this week why Saudi Arabia wants oil prices back at 80 to $100 a barrel plus the end of the Castro era for the decades-old u.s. economic blockade of Cuba is still very much in place so a trade war and a new Cold War are threatening to rip apart the global economy that's the springtime message from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank soaring debts is also threatening to spoil the party the IMF saying it came in and 164 trillion dollars in 2016 that's a historic peak the IMF bails out failing economies and tries to create financial stability as war bank lends to poor and middle-income countries together these two United Nations institutions aim to raise global living standards but there's danger ahead even if the world economy is projected to grow by 3.6 percent in 2018 while the sun is shining not today in Washington but usually while the sun is shining we are seeing more clouds accumulating on the horizon than we did back in October global debt is at an all-time high well joining us now from London is Gregor oh and chief economist at the Global Council thanks very much for being with us so what do you make then of the imf's assessment of the global economy and where it's going in 2018 prospects are good one or two clouds on the horizon concerns about protectionism concerns about financial vulnerabilities in China but overall a fairly positive picture from the IMF concern expressed though about rising debt levels in in many countries what are the implications of that for growth then I think the really big concern is is China now China growth prospects remain goods in China nobody's expecting a major slowdown tomorrow in Chinese growth but the big concern about China is that debt to GDP is still rising is projected to rise further still is very high by the standards of other countries or by historical standards and frankly it looks unsustainable so I think that is a genuine concern over the next few years for the stability of the global economy let's talk a little bit more about the protectionism and the issues with China that you bring up because this is something that's been in the news a lot lately and the fears of a trade war between the US and China how much of a concern is that and how much of a drag could that be on the global economy because we are talking about two of the biggest economies in the world here sure well first of all we're not in a trade war yet but there is a risk of a trade war one of the concerns about trade water said that it wouldn't just involve the US and China would inevitably drag in other countries as well and other countries would be caught up in the crossfire if you like between the US and China right now I think it'd be fair to describe US policy as unpredictable also quite aggressive equally I think when you look at when you look at China's policy stance also what the Europeans might do if there are any measures significant measures introduced targeting China or others I think we can we can expect to see retaliation and that that's where the trade boss scenario really begins to potentially become a real one in fairness to the US though they have just recapitalized the World Bank how do we understand that in the context of this whole America first policy and and and suspicions of global institutions and all the rest of it well III think that is a remarkable achievement by the World Bank to get American agreement to do that the World Bank is likely this week it will receive a capital increase that will also results in China receiving a bigger voting share but nothing China's voting share at the World Bank will be nothing like as big as the US voicing share won't threaten the u.s. veto over significant policy decisions taken by the World Bank we will see that the World Bank shift its focus from countries like China to purest countries the US and many other countries would welcome that it is you know to be honest I think I was surprised that the u.s. agreed to do it because it has been so hostile to making concessions of this sort in the past I think it reflects the sort of on off approach to engagement with international institutions that we've seen under the Trump administration and it certainly reflects some skilled diplomacy by the leadership the president of the World Bank himself I think it's a personal triumph for him speaking of stability or perhaps lack of it the ongoing tensions right now between the United States and Russia over everything from the war in Syria the dispute over meddling in domestic politics and and all the rest of it the ongoing sanctions there there is the potential for this to to grow into something further not just a cold war but a real war what's the potential of that if it if it does happen on the global economy well again this is another area where US policy is quite unpredictable they've sort of had an on/off approach to sanctions against Russia the vyd various causes for introducing sanctions against Russia various provocations from the Russians certainly the most recent round of sanctions targeting oligarchs and officials were much more far-reaching than the Russians but expecting and they've had a profound economic impact markets impacts in Russia the ruble has come under pressure the Russian stock market has fallen quite significantly because they partly targeted aluminium producers in Russia that's pushed up aluminium prices and so that's probably the main channel through which those sanctions are already impacting on other economies could it get worse could it lead to war I think that the you know both sides but especially the us of an interest and avoiding direct military conflicts with Russia I think that would be hugely undesirable for everyone but equally I find it hard to see a sort of pathway for a better diplomatic relationship between either the us and the Russians or the Europeans and the Russians and for that reason I I think we've got to accept that this this threat of an escalation certainly in sanctions is going to be with us for a long period of time and it's really going to impact in the Russian economy but it has the potential to impact on other countries as well Gregor oh and good to speak with you thank you our public outcry in China forced its most popular social media network to reverse a decision to ban online gay content Sina Weibo at China's equivalent of Twitter received a backlash when it blocked videos and comics referring to homosexuality Adrian Brown reports last October President Xi Jingping set out his long term vision for China it included total control of the internet ridding it of content deemed inappropriate on Friday the country's equivalent of Twitter began deleting posts relating to pornography violence and gay culture but on Monday following a furious online reaction the company reversed its decision remarkable says one prominent LGBT activist Hong Kong I think it's a significant for sure as a media platform Cena sending such a notice to all his users is very important but there was no apology gay rights came late to China homosexuality only ceased to be a crime 21 years ago and was finally Declassified as a mental illness four years later but the LGBT community says it still faces discrimination and persecution in five lesbian activists were detained for campaigning against the sexual harassment of women on public transport yet on Monday the gay community here pulled off what few pressure groups in China have achieved a climbed down by a corporation with close links to the government I really feel encouraged I see a lot of support from weaving and outside our community now we are going to stick with our original mission ending discrimination against homosexuality well on Tuesday sigh no way Bo's reprieve appeared to be holding in general the tone of the posts were positive but also qualified for instance one here says beware of the candy we need to keep fighting it is not known if the government ordered sina weibo to withdraw its decision although a company statement says they are no longer deleting material for the time being members of the LGBT community say they are not dissidents because they don't advocate political change but they are on the margins of what China's government is prepared to tolerate our streaming service Netflix is now worth 146 billion dollars that market valuation means it's catching up on media giant Walt Disney Netflix added 7 point 4 million more subscribers between January and March this year the fastest growth in its history are those quarterly results help shares hit an all-time high on Wednesday because Netflix does not use advertising it doesn't have the same issues over data privacy as other streaming video providers Facebook and Google insist on being called technology companies that's despite depending on ad revenue business models Netflix because it spends big on original content is happy to be called a media company reports say and now wants to buy movie theaters alright still to come on counting the cost how Jordan with no oil and gas reserve of its own is diversifying into renewables to cut its energy bill but first the post castro era has begun in cuba the change comes at a time of growing economic uncertainty for the Caribbean islands 11 million people the new president Miguel Diaz canal has some tough challenges ahead more from our Latin America editor Lucy Ewing Diaz canal is a communist party caterer who according to Castro has passed all the tests of loyalty to the Cuban Revolution but the real end of the Castro era would take another three years from dos a fake when the eight Party Congress ends and the gradual and orderly transfer of her main responsibilities is made to the new generations is then if my health allows that I will become just one more soldier along with the Cuban people defending this revolution on the streets there was no commotion and little excitement I imagine there won't be any drastic change anytime soon but something will change for better or worse I'm not watching this I hope there's a change for the better that's what we're all hoping for with Venezuelan subsidies almost gone diaz canal needs to transform Cuba's ailing soviet-style economy he is a survivor which obviously means that he knows how to work the system he knows how to the mechanics of the system but he's taking over at a difficult time of renewed tensions with Washington under President Donald Trump and while Diaz Canal does represent a generational shift here in terms of the crucial relationship with Cuba's powerful northern neighbor it's back to the old Cold War days well there's also another problem when it comes to analyzing the Cuban economy the government emitted some key data in its 2016 public accounts and that lack of clarity is deterring foreign investors the World Bank says the economy is growing at its slowest pace in two decades with Cuba's soviet-style planned economy there are still many government restrictions as well on self-employed workers in September hurricane Irma battered tourist resorts the economic meltdown in nearby Venezuela is depriving the government of an important source of subsidies and then there's the hostile US administration three years ago then President Barack Obama moved to normalize ties with Cuba opening embassies in their respective capitals but Donald Trump has been looking to roll back some of those changes since he took office and Cuba also imports 80 percent of its food so paying for it is going to become more difficult well joining us now from London is Diego Moya or Campos a senior analyst for the Americas with IHS market thanks very much for being with us so what should Cubans make then or what should they expect from mr. Diaz Cannell because he is kind of an unknown quantity isn't he absolutely what we can expect from ele a canal is policy continuity and gradual economic reform but no democratic political opening or googas moving towards a more pluralistic political system and why do you think that is is it because he's kind of still trying to strike a balance between the two and knowing as well that Raul Castro is is still there in the background yeah I mean you know turns Miguel da canal policies don't differ much from those of indeed former President Raul Castro the canal is Raul Castro's boy and change will continue being steered by Raul Castro who will remain the head of the Communist Party in Cuba which is the one which calls the shots and the air canal will try to enable change in a way that it will not make feel uncomfortable the old Castro the old Cuban Revolutionary Guard and the security apparatus so we expect change and a gradual continuing opening of Cuba's economy to foreign direct investment to the private sector but at a pace to wait you know again the security apparatus the Communist Party old guard will feel comfortable the fact is though that the Cuban economy is is suffering badly at the moment and there is an argument that there is a need to unshackle the state resources a little bit and open things up because that is what Cubans need I mean how how great is that pressure there's a huge need for that especially as a grown-ass Venezuela's economy continues under pressure Venezuela no longer sends 100 South and barrels of oil per day to Cuba as he was the case some years ago when it's what is currently sending 40,000 barrels of oil per day and this remains Cuba's main source of income over remittances over revenues from the tourist sector so indeed as Venezuela's economy continues under pressure and as a potential for more US sanctions on Venezuela more isolation of direct kanami continue increasing so will Cuba have more and more need to indeed open up the economy the military plays a key role in the security a part of plays a key role behind the scenes controlling the economy and any gradual opening of the economy will have to be done at a pace at which it will not increase the hopes or the expectations of the local population that indeed this end former end of the Castros era will come up with a democratic political opening and what about the Trump factor because we've seen this sudden slide in in relations with the u.s. since he became president not long after diplomatic relations were restored after 50 over 50 years or so what's the potential impact of that certainly we expect that the relation between the u.s. and Cuba will continue the terror 18 reproach main efforts advanced by former President Barack Obama have been reverted at the moment what we expect from the US administration of incumbent president Abdulla Trump is that he will continue constraining or restraining US investment towards Cuba and that he will continue pushing for more restrictions in terms of trade it is highly unlikely that the relation between the u.s. and Cuba will improve and indeed it is highly unlikely that the US embargo will be lifted anytime soon Diego Moya or Campos thanks for being with us Thank You Hasan a pleasure now Africa's first plant that converts waste to energy is close to coming on line in Ethiopia it's been built next to a landfill site in the capital Addis Ababa Stephanie Decker went to have a look this is addis ababa 'he's only waste dumping site it is on an extraordinary scale we're being told it's been here for around 50 years it also goes around 30 meters underground it is untreated it is not dealt with it keeps growing now waste is of course not just an Ethiopian problem it's not just an African problem it is a global problem now there is an exciting new project underway here it is Africa's very first waste-to-energy plant currently we are inside of the waste-to-energy plant in Addis Ababa this what you see is the tipping hole that will receive the waste so basically what the facility this one receive is 1,400 tons a day this is equals to almost 80 percent of Addis our waste what currently goes to the land field and polluting the environment once this facility starts operating and in generating this waste we can able to produce 185 Giga our electricity which is equivalent to light up 30% of ad7 household we're told that the plant will be fully operational in a couple of months from now and once it gets underway it's going to make a massive difference to the Capitals waste management now this is technology that's already being used on every single other continent and this is why authorities here are keen to showcase it as a success story as Africa's first and of course it remains just a small step in dealing with the vast quantities of waste that we as humans produce how high can all go this week we saw the highest levels for crude prices since November 2014 brent hits 74 dollars and West Texas intermediary touched 69 dollars a bell that's up nearly 50 percent from this time last year reports say Saudi Arabia would like to see oil prices at 80 dollars or even a hundred dollars about the kingdom needs 83 dollars a barrel to balance the budget and it wants to give a boost to its oil giant Aramco before a widely anticipated public stock sale a deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia to limit global oil supply to 1.8 million barrels a day has worked the world is no longer drowning in oil but the fear among other producers is that higher oil prices will throw off the delicate balance of supply and demand and drive up US shale production oil market watchers are also waiting to see if the US will rip up the nuclear deal with Iran and bring back sanctions next month and finally Jordan is driving into the future German company is investing in charging stations for electric cars across the country and since Jordan doesn't produce oil there's good reason to move away from fuel burning cars Natasha Vadim reports the engine hardly makes a sound and that can mean Hashem GU Sain often forgets to turn off the ignition he admits he sparked and walked off with the car still running but that quiet and not having to fill up are two of the reasons the college student loves driving his electric car the benefits is to save his money like I said and to stay away from troubles and fixing the car everyone and it's good for them there are now about 10 dealers including Renault selling electric cars in Jordan last month a German company announced plans to build 10,000 charging stations across the country and there's an all-electric public transportation service called Taos Cielo the government offers incentives to consumers no customs fees or taxes the main reason for anyone to buy a car you are not buying a bank and attacks so you will buy the car really less expensive than Nepali gasoline or diesel vehicles there's a good economic reason to for the government to steer away from gas burning vehicles Jordan imports more than 90 percent of the oil it needs in order to reduce the economic burden the country is not only encouraging Jordanians to drive electric cars but it's investing in wind solar and solid waste energy right now there are 2 billion dollars worth of renewable energy projects underway this month the government unveiled the second phase of a national energy efficiency action plan in place for more than a decade they're always hoping just only to pave the way forward in order to reduce our consumption patterns on one hand and to increase the potential contribution the potential utilization of the of other renewable energy resources the goal is to continue to drive down energy use by 20 percent and increase renewable energies imprint to 10 percent by 2020 experts say Jordan has already become such a leader in the Middle East its neighbors have expressed interest in replicating these initiatives
