CLEARLY IF THE PRESIDENT FAILS, THE WORLD FAILS. JOINING US NOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF NEWS TO GET TO. HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN DEVIN NUNES. MR. CHAIRMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. THE FIRST THING I WANT IS YOUR REACTION TO ROD ROSENSTEIN, A TWO-PART QUESTION. DID HE THREATEN TO SUBPOENA THE EMAILS OF VIEW, OTHER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, YOUR STAFF, AND OTHER DOCUMENTS? BECAUSE HE HAD ONE OF HIS TEMPER TANTRUMS AND GOT ANGRY? LIVE IN SINGAPORE. I THINK YOU SHOULD COME AWAY EVENTUALLY BUT I ENJOY SEEING YOU THERE. LISTEN, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SINCE LAST AUGUST. WE SUBPOENAED THEM IN LAST AUGUST. WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET DOCUMENTS. WE CAN'T GET DOCUMENTS. WE'VE HAD MANY, WHAT I WOULD SAY, ALTERCATIONS WITH THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HIS STAFF. WHAT I THINK IS INAPPROPRIATE I AM FINE. I CAN TAKE THE HEAT. YOU CAN ATTACK ME ALL YOU WANT. I'M USED TO IT. I ENJOY. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ATTACKING STAFF AND WHEN THE STAFF FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE, THAT'S WHEN YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR. THE STAFF ARE CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES WHO WORK HARD FOR THEIR COUNTRY, THEY ARE PATRIOTS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO COME ON TELEVISION LIKE I DO AND PLEAD MY CASE. LOOK, THE STAFF DEFINITELY HAVE FELT THREATENED. JUST RECENTLY, THE STAFF WERE ALL KICKED OUT OF THE ROOM. WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MOST RIGHT NOW IS OBSTRUCTION OF A VALID CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU JUST ONE POINT, AND I WILL GO BACK TO YOU, SEAN. ONE SIMPLE POINTS. WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. FISA ABUSE AND OTHER MATTERS. WE NOW ARE AT THE END. WE DOCUMENTS. TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN THIS SITUATION. IN THE LAST WEEKS, THEY HAVE KICKED OUT THE STAFF. THE LEAD INVESTIGATORS ON THIS. NOW THEY HAVE KICKED OUT ALL THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS, SO THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE GOING TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTS TO THE WHOLE ENTIRE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ONLY TO REPUBLICANS. PAUL RYAN, THE SPEAKER, AND MYSELF. THIS IS TOTALLY ACCEPTABLE. IT'S A CLASSIC CASE OF OBSTRUCTION OF A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. AT THE PROBLEM WE HAVE HERE IS, WHO'S GOING TO INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS? Sean: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT A STAFFER, CASH PER TOWEL. IS HE THE ONE OR ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO GOT KICKED OUT OF THE ROOM? I REALLY WANT TO KNOW, WHEN YOU THREATEN AND INTIMIDATE, TO USE THE POWER OF THAT OFFICE, BEING THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL, ISN'T THAT ITSELF A FORM OF OBSTRUCTION COMMANDOS THAT RAISED THE QUESTION OF IMPEACHING ROD ROSENSTEIN? I WILL TELL YOU, I WOULD RATHER NOT GET INTO THE NAMES OF THE STAFF. IT'S MORE THAN ONE. FOR THE PARTICULAR INCIDENT, THERE WERE THREE STAFF IN THE ROOM BUT THERE'S BEEN MANY OTHERS THAT HE FELT THREATENED DIFFERENT LEVELS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMIDATED. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMIDATED. OUR MEMBERS HAVE NOT BEEN INTIMIDATED. BUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE NOW, HOW DO YOU GET TO OBSTRUCTION, HOW DO YOU GET TO MISLEADING CONGRESS? TAKING THIS INFORMATION WE'VE BEEN LEGALLY ASKING FOR, A LEGAL SUBPOENA THAT WE ARE TRYING TO ENFORCE, AND YOU MOVE IT UPSTAIRS AND SAY NO, NO, IT'S GOING TO BE SUPER TOP-SECRET INFORMATION THAT WE ARE ONLY GOING TO GIVE TO THE GANG OF EIGHT. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. PEOPLE IN AMERICA SHOULD BE ALARMED. THIS IS A WAY TO HIDE INFORMATION NOT ONLY FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BUT TO THEIR CONGRESSMEN. AND TO THE STAFF THAT WORK FOR THEM. Sean: HOW DO YOU POSSIBLY GET IT? IS IT TRUE THAT ROD ROSENSTEIN BLEW UP AT YOU A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THAT HE HAS A HORRIBLE TEMPER? AND DO YOU VIEW HIS THREAT AS A FORM OF OBSTRUCTION IN AND OF ITSELF? THAT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION, WHETHER OR NOT HE SHOULD REMAIN IN THAT ROLE. LET ME ANSWER THE FIRST PART. I HAD TO PSYCHOANALYSIS ON ROD ROSENSTEIN. BUT I CAN TELL YOU IS THE BEHAVIORS ON ACCEPTABLE. HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTS. I SAID THIS A COUPLE WEEKS AGO ON MARIA'S SUNDAY MORNING SHOW ON FOX. I SAID LOOK, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO, IF YOU IF THERE IS NO FISA ABUSE HERE, NO PROBLEMS WITH THE FISA APPLICATION, IF THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS, INFORMANTS WERE SPIES OR WHATEVER WERE RUN INTO THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN COME ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SHOW THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS. LET THE INVESTIGATORS COMB THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS. WE ARE NOT GETTING MAD. WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU? WE WOULD EXONERATE THEM IN A SECOND. WHERE DOES THIS LEAD? TOMORROW WE HAVE THE IG REPORT COMING OUT. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST STEP FOR AMERICA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FBI BEGIN THE HEALING PROCESS. THE HEALING PROCESS WOULD BE MADE MUCH EASIER IF WE COULD COMPLETE THAT BY THEN DELIVERING ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS TO US. TOMORROW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DELIVER DOCUMENTS TO THE SPEAKER AND MYSELF. WE INFORMED EVERY REPUBLICAN MEMBER ON OUR COMMITTEE, SIGNED A LETTER TODAY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SAVE TOTALLY ON ACCEPTABLE. AN INVESTIGATION THAT WE STARTED Sean: HOW DO YOU STOP IT? TWO WAYS. WE CAN HOLD MR. ROSENSTEIN AND OTHERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN CONTEMPT AND IMPEACH. THE OTHER WAY WOULD BE FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO DEMAND THEM, TO ORDER THEM TO GIVE US ALL THE DOCUMENTS. THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY TWO WAYS. Sean: THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE. THE PRESIDENT NEEDS TO HEAR THIS MESSAGE. ARE YOU WILLING TO GO, SIR, AS FAR AS IMPEACHING? WELL I AM AM ALREADY PAST. I WANTED TO MOVE TO CONTEMPT MONTHS AGO. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE BELIEVES HE CAN WORK WITH DOJ AND WERE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK IT TOMORROW. BUT I CAN TELL YOU MY PATIENCE HAS RUN OUT. I HAVE NONE LEFT. NOW IT'S REALLY UP TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE HOUSE AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SUBPOENA GETS COMPLIED WITH. Sean: WE CANNOT HAVE A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES THAT IS PREVENTING CONGRESS FROM DOING THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL JOB AND THREATENING PEOPLE USING THE POWER OF THAT OFFICE WHICH IS SO POWERFUL TO INTIMIDATE, HARASS,
