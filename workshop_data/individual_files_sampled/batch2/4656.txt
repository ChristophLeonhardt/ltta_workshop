let me ask you about other big news in addition to immigration and this relates to it the the victories we've been talking about this morning of Alexandria of Castile Cortes not who is a 20 year old woman out of New York beating Joe Crowley a couple of things on that she ran in her district on abolishing ice I don't know that I've seen public reaction from you on this issue do you think ice should be abolished is that something that Democrats in Congress should take up and push I've been a strong strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform we have immigration laws that need to be changed we also have enforcement of our immigration laws that includes ice and on the border the Customs and Border Patrol people those enforcement of processes also need to be reviewed and changed as appropriate so it should be in the context of comprehensive immigration reform that I have been a longtime advocate of I'm sorry I mean interrupts it sounds like you're saying change ice don't get rid of it is that fair well I think we should be we should look at what kind of enforcement processes ice uses and whether it's appropriate and as I said that should be part of a comprehensive immigration reform process you have been one of the biggest voices in the Senate on immigration reform but you also are inside obviously the Democratic Party led by on the Senate side Chuck Schumer on the house side Nancy Pelosi Ocasio Cortez's victory does it signal to you do you think that it's time for Schumer and Pelosi to step aside that there is frustration brewing inside the Democratic Party against establishment leadership the better the Democratic Party is a really big ten we have a lot of people who are much more conservative I've been a progressive and we used to be called liberals back then and so you know the people who win are the ones in our party who are in touch with their constituents and who their constituents know will fight for them and I think Alexandra was very clear on the things that were important to her constituents and they heard her message and so do you think that message will reflect or should reflect in the halls of Congress when it comes to the current makeup of Democratic leadership does that need to change to me the lesson learned is that all of us should be very much in touch with our constituencies that's what I seek to do and then our constituents need to know that we're for them we're fighting for them and this is not a one size fits all our candidates have to know their districts they need to understand what the concerns are of their own constituencies and that is not a hundred percent the same all across our country so the kennedys who in here wants to understand and who are in touch thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's really easy just click on that button down there and for more news from MSNBC click on any of these videos here for the latest interviews and highlights you can get more videos from MSNBC with our newsletters head over to msnbc.com slash newsletters to sign up
