♪ ♪ Greg: ALL RIGHT, ACCORDING TO A NEW CNN ARTICLE, TOO MUCH BAD NEWS CAN MAKE YOU SICK. WELL, THEY ARE THE EXPERTS. THEY POINT TO SOCIAL MEDIA, NEW TECHNOLOGY, 24-HOUR NEWS WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO EXPERIENCE STUFF YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE DECADES AGO. WHO COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS? A MURDER IN ONE STATE, A TRAIN CRASH, WILDFIRE, FLOOD, THEY ALL COMMAND YOU AT ONCE. IT OVERWHELMS YOU. THAT COMES DISASTER FATIGUE. HOW DOES THIS MAKE YOU SICK? THE ARTICLE NEVER SHOWS ANY STATISTICS ABOUT THAT. IT'S ALL HYPOTHETICAL. NO EVIDENCE. MAYBE THERE COULD BE THE PROBLEM, CNN. HERE IS MY THEORY. SOME BAD NEWS AT ALL THAT MAKES YOU SICK. IT'S THE "YOU ARE BAD NEWS." WHEN EVERY STORY PAINTS U.S. THE VILLAIN WHICH HAPPENS DAILY. HERE IS BAD NEWS. POLAR BEARS ARE DISAPPEARING. HERE IS YOU ARE BAD NEWS. IT'S BECAUSE YOU MISTREAT THE PLANET. ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS UP. HERE IS YOU ARE BAD IF IT BUGS YOU, YOU MUST BE A BIGOT. BAD NEWS: POLICE SHOULD A MINORITY. YOU ARE BAD NEWS: BECAUSE AMERICA, YOU ARE RACIST. HOW HEALTHY IS IT TO BE TOLD HOURLY THAT YOU ARE HEARTLESS, RACIST, AND KILLING THE EARTH? THAT'S MOST NEWS EXCEPT HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU ARE A GOOD PERSON. HE WILL GET IN OTHER PLACES. TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, CNN IS THEIR MEGAPHONE. THEY HAVE THE SAME MESSAGE: YOU ARE BAD. EVERYTHING IS BORN THROUGH THE SAME FILTER, THE CAMPUS. IT CREATES ONE CONCLUSION. YOU ARE THE OPPRESSOR. YOU ARE GUILTY. IF THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU SICK, RICHARD. YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE, DANA? CNN HAD ANOTHER ARTICLE RIGHT AFTER THAT AND IT WAS ABOUT HOW AMAZING AMERICA IS REMEMBER YOU HAVE A GREAT ECONOMY, NORTH KOREA, LOW UNEMPLOYMENT. WHY ARE PEOPLE SO SAD? THAT WAS AN ACTUAL ARTICLE THAT RAN AFTER THIS ONE. CNN IS, THEY HAVE NO SELF-AWARENESS. Dana: WONDER ABOUT THE POLL HE BEAR THAT OUT. IF YOU ASK PEOPLE, DO YOU THINK AMERICA IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC? THOSE NUMBERS ARE HEADED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. IT MIGHT BE THAT THE PEOPLE RUNNING THE HEADLINES, THE PEOPLE OF THEIR PEER GROUP AND THE PEOPLE THEY ARE FRIENDS WITH, THEY ARE MISERABLE. Greg: CONFIRMATION BIAS, KIMBERLY BRADY WON'T FIND THAT IT FOX NEWS BECAUSE WE APPRECIATE THE VIEWER. WE DON'T BELIEVE AMERICA IS INHERENTLY EVIL LIKE THIS OTHER JERK FACES AT THE OTHER CABLE NETWORKS. Kimberly: SCREW THEM. WE ARE TOO BUSY BEING HAPPY AND WINNING, RIGHT? SUCH A GOOD POINT. PEOPLE SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO WATCH THE NEWS BECAUSE IT'S UPSETTING. YOU GET PERSONALLY BLAMED LIKE IT RELATES TO LIKE AMERICA'S BAD PLACE, AMERICANS ARE RACIST, THAT AMERICANS ARE ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEMSELVES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE REAL FACTS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON, WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST GENEROUS COUNTRIES IF NOT THE MOST GENEROUS COUNTRY IN TERMS OF HELPING OUT OTHER COUNTRIES. WE HAVE GREAT RECORD ON EMPLOYMENT NUMBERS NOW. PEOPLE ARE BACK AT WORK. THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY. YOU SEE THE NUMBERS, WITH WOMEN AND MINORITIES, AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. WE ARE TRYING TO DO EVEN MORE TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES. THESE ARE THE POSITIVE GOOD NEWS STORIES. LIKE DANA'S BOOK. PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR IT AND HEAR ABOUT THE WINDS ARE NOT CONSTANTLY BE MADE TO FEEL BAD ABOUT THEMSELVES BECAUSE SOMEHOW YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING TO BE A BLIGHT ON THE REST OF THE WORLD AND YOU ARE DESTROYING THE ENVIRONMENT WHILE YOU'RE AT IT. Greg: THEY TOUCHED ON SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT HERE, THAT TECHNOLOGY AND CABLE TAKES EVERY STORY MAKES IT NATIONAL. WE THINK THAT ALL THE STUFF IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. Juan: I THOUGHT YOUR POINT WAS WELL TAKEN. HAD NO STATISTICAL BASIS. BUT I MUST SAY I THINK THE POINT YOU ARE NOW MAKING ABOUT EVERY EARTHQUAKE, EVERY MURDER IS A NATIONAL STORY, THAT'S ALSO TRUE AND IT AFFECTS YOU. A LOT OF PEOPLE DO, WHAT KIMBERLY WAS DESCRIBING, SAYING I DON'T WATCH NEWS AS MUCH AS I USED TO BECAUSE THEY THINK, ESPECIALLY IN OUR AUDIENCE, THAT IS ALL NASTY TRUMP STUFF AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT BUT SECONDLY, A LOT OF IT IS DEPRESSING. EVERY STATION DOES BREAKING NEWS, BREAKING NEWS. WHAT IS THIS? IT CATCHES YOUR EYEBALL. IT'S ALMOST LIKE AN INVOLUNTARY RESPONSE. YOUR HEAD SWINGS TO THE TV. I FIND IT ODD COMING FROM MR. "I HATE THESE PEOPLE" THAT YOU ARE SAYING WE ARE THE LOVE BOAT RIGHT HERE AT FOX NEWS. Greg: THAT'S TRUE. I AM A HYPOCRITE. YOU GOT ME THERE. YOU DO A NEWS PROGRAM. I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE MORNINGS. IS IT A LOCAL PROGRAM? Brian: IT'S GOING TO BE NATIONAL. Greg: IT'S A DELIGHTFUL SHOW. YOU HAVE COOKING SEGMENTS. Brian: WE USED TO HAVE PET OF THE DAY. RATINGS GOT TOO HIGH. 65% SAY THEY FOLLOW THE NEWS MOST OF THE TIME. 68% SAID THEY ARE WORN OUT BY THE NEWS. HERE'S WHAT I SAY. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA, PRESIDENT BUSH WAS PRESIDENT, THE ONE THING WITH FOX AND WE DON'T PROGRAM THE SAME STORY. LOOK HOW DIFFERENT THE SHOW'S. LOOK HOW DIFFERENT OUR SHOW IS. THERE IS NOT "TRUMP IS GREAT," "OBAMA IS BAD." "BUSH IS FANTASTIC." WE SWITCH GEARS. 45 MINUTES ABOUT BAD TRUMPETERS IN 15 MINUTES ON HOW THEY WISH OPRAH WAS PRESIDENT. SHOWS A PROGRAM, IF YOU WATCH HERE, PEOPLE ARE HAPPIER. I WOULD LIKE CNN DO A STUDY ON WHY FOX VIEWERS ARE HAPPIER. WE HAVE A DIVERSITY OF VIEWS AND ALLOWS YOU TO GET INFORMATION AND FORM YOUR OWN OPINION. Greg: WHEN YOU FEEL BAD WATCHING THE NEWS.
