THE BORDER.

4
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:31,188
WHY WOULD THAT BE A BLUE WAVE?

5
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:31,989
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A RED

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:32,289
WAVE.

7
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,123
REALLY!

8
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:33,857
I THINK IT SHOULD BE A RED WAY.

00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,476
HE IS BACK IN CAMPAIGN MODE.

21
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:57,915
OVERALL IN THE MIDTERMS.

22
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:58,849
>> THIS IS WHERE PRESIDENT

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,416
TRUMP IS AT HIS BEST.

00:00:59,417 --> 00:01:06,790
OUT THERE ON THE ROAD, TALKING

25
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:07,424

AND SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO THE

29
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:10,461
AMERICAN VOTER.

30
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:15,332
THIS IS PART OF THE STRATEGY.

31
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:15,766
THESE RALLIES.

32
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:16,834
THEY ARE PART OF THIS TRAGEDY

33
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:17,568
THAT GOT HIM VICTORY IN

34
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:18,869
NOVEMBER 2016 AND HE KNOWS IT.

35
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,871
HIS TEAM IS PUTTING TOGETHER A

36
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,973
SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, IT WILL

37
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:25,943
LOOK A LOT LIKE 2016.

38
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:27,878
>> THE PRESIDENT'S TALK ABOUT A

39
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:28,579
RED WAVE COMING INSTEAD OF A

40
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:28,946
BLUE WAVE.

41
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,215
THE PRESIDENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN

42
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,149
ALABAMA, GEORGIA AND REPUBLICAN

43
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,985
PRIMARIES BUT HE HASN'T REALLY

44
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:36,186
BEEN TESTED IN A REPUBLICAN

45
00:01:36,187 --> 00:01:36,920
VERSUS DEMOCRAT.

46
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:42,159
YOU THINK IT WILL BE A RED

47
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,459
WAVE?

48
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,594
>> I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE

49
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:44,595
NOVEMBER ELECTION BECAUSE THIS

50
00:01:44,596 --> 00:01:45,629
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE ABLE

51
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,197
TO RUN OVER THE NEXT 95 OR SO

52
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:51,168
DAYS ON HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

53
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:54,805
ON THIS TREMENDOUS LIST OF

54
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:56,106
PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT.

55
00:01:56,107 --> 00:01:56,840
4.1 PERCENT GDP.

56
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:57,574
SOMETHING OBAMA SAID WAS NEVER

57
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,611
GOING TO BE SEEN AGAIN.

58
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:01,245
3.9 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT.

59
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,679
THE LOWEST IN 18 YEARS.

60
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,683
WHEN ECONOMIC INDICATOR AFTER

61
00:02:06,684 --> 00:02:07,651
THE OTHER THAN OUR ECONOMY IS

62
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:08,185
ON FIRE.

63
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:09,119
THIS PRESIDENT HAS A RECORD TO

64
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,453
RUN ON.

65
00:02:09,454 --> 00:02:10,988
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BETTER

66
00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:12,423
OFF TODAY THAN THEY WERE IN

67
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,724
NOVEMBER 2016 AND THAT IS WHERE

68
00:02:13,725 --> 00:02:14,992
WE ARE GOING TO BE EDUCATING

69
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:18,362
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

70
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:19,263
BECAUSE THE OPPOSITE WILL BE

71
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,563
TRUE.

72
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:25,102
YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.

73
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:31,175
IT IS GOING TO BE AN INCREDIBLE

74
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:31,875
AGENDA GOING THE OPPOSITE

75
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,744
DIRECTION IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE

76
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:34,678
ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSE.

77
00:02:34,679 --> 00:02:35,345
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO

78
00:02:35,346 --> 00:02:36,947
KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT A JOKE.

79
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,519
FORWARD AGENDA OF AMERICA FIRST

80
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:49,693
OR GOING BACK TO THE OLD WAYS

81
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:50,294
THAT WERE OF YESTERDAY.

82
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,195
>> ALL RIGHT WE WILL BE

83
00:02:51,196 --> 00:02:51,895

84
00:02:51,896 --> 00:02:52,696

85
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:59,236
TROY BALDERSON IN OHIO AGAINST

86
00:02:59,237 --> 00:02:59,603
O'CONNOR.

87
00:02:59,604 --> 00:03:00,571
HOW MUCH SHOULD BE READ INTO

88
00:03:00,572 --> 00:03:00,871
THIS?

89
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,105
AS A STATEMENT OF THE POLES I

90
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:02,840
THINK ARE WITHIN A POINT OF

91
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:03,240
EACH OTHER.

92
00:03:03,241 --> 00:03:04,141
THIS IS A DISTRICT THAT HAS

93
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:04,875
BEEN RED FOR DECADES NOW.

94
00:03:04,876 --> 00:03:06,577
IF A REPUBLICAN LOSES, SHOULD

95
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:07,244
THE ALARM BELLS BE BLARING

96
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:08,779
ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT

97
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,513
REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE CONCERNED

98
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,486
>> THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT

99
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:15,786
RACE.

100
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:16,286
WE NEED TO WIN.

101
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:17,588
THE PRESENT ONLY WON THIS

102
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:18,555
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT BY A TWO

103
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:19,957
OR THREE POINTS IN NOVEMBER OF

104
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:20,257
