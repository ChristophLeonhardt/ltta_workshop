1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,503
CAPITOL HILL WERE SENATOR 

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,270
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS SPEAKING 

3
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,438
ABOUT HIS LONGTIME FRIEND THE 

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:10,376
LATE SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. 

5
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:12,112
>>DEVOTED WIFE, YOU DID WELL BY 

6
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,215
JOHN. 

7
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,451
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, I WILL 

8
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,654
TRY TO MAKE THIS SOMEWHAT FUN, 

9
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:26,793
EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT FEEL IN A 

10
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:27,193
FUNNY MOOD. 

11
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,661
BOTTOM LINE IS LET'S START OFF 

12
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,664
WITH --. 

13
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,266
FOR ANYBODY WHO MAY BE WATCHING 

14
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,135
ON TELEVISION, THIS IS A NAVAL 

15
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:35,468
ACADEMY TYPE. 

16
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:38,304
I WORE THIS TODAY, JOHN, TO 

17
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:41,508
HONOR YOU AND TO ANNOY YOU AT 

18
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:42,208
THE SAME TIME. 

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:46,079
HE WOULD CONSTANTLY TELL ME, 

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,480
LINDSAY, I WISH YOU WERE IN MY 

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,314
NAVAL ACADEMY CLASS. 

22
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,650
I SAID THAT IS VERY NICE, JOHN. 

23
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,052
DO YOU KNOW WHY, LINDSAY? 

24
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,054
I SAID NO, JOHN. 

25
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,457
HE SAID IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY 

26
00:00:57,457 --> 00:00:58,491
CLASS I WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX 

27
00:00:58,491 --> 00:00:59,592
FROM THE BOTTOM NOT SIX. 

28
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,928
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOHN. 

29
00:01:01,928 --> 00:01:06,933
HUMILIATION WAS HIS CONSTANT 

30
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:07,233
COMPANION. 

31
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,270
THE MORE HUMILIATED YOU THE 

32
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,937
MORE HE LIKED TO. 

33
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,538
IN THAT REGARD I WAS WELL 

34
00:01:12,538 --> 00:01:15,942
SERVED. 

35
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,143
TO MY COLLEAGUES, THANK YOU SO 

36
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:18,912
MUCH FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. 

37
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,214
THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO PUT THIS 

38
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:25,885
IN WORDS THAT MAY BE JOHN CAN 

39
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:30,457
RELATE TO IS AFTER A MILITARY 

40
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:31,391
OPERATION IS OVER AFTER THE 

41
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:32,525
MISSION IS COMPLETE THE PILOT 

42
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:35,161
COME BACK AND DEBRIEF. 

43
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:42,268
IF THERE IS A MILITARY 

44
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,169
OPERATION THERE IS AN AFTER 

45
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:43,569
ACTION REPORT. 

46
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:46,506
I THOUGHT WHAT WOULD IT SAY? 

47
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,507
WHAT WOULD A AFTER ACTION 

48
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,441
REPORT SAY FOR JOHN McCAIN? 

49
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,942
THE REPORT WOULD SAY LESSONS 

50
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,478
LEARNED SO THAT OTHERS WOULD 

51
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:53,913
BENEFIT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE 

52
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:54,180
REMEMBER. 

53
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,381
REMEMBER THE THINGS THAT WENT 

54
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,785
WELL AND THE THINGS THAT DID NOT

55
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,520
SO WE WILL BE BETTER OFF AS A 

56
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,560
UNIT AND AS A NATION. 

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,895
THE TITLE OF THE OPERATION WAS 

58
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,395
EASY, YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF 

59
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:11,531
THINGS ABOUT ME BUT CLEVER IS 

60
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:12,332
NOT ONE OF THEM. 

61
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:12,765
OPERATION MAVERICK. 

62
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,302
IT BEGAN IN THE FALL IN 1954, 

63
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,505
THE YEAR BEFORE I WAS BORN, AT 

64
00:02:19,505 --> 00:02:25,445
THE NAVAL ACADEMY, AND IT ENDED 

65
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,548
25 AUGUST 2018. 

66
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,284
WHAT CAN WE LEARN? 

67
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:35,155
THE SOURCE OF THE REPORT IS ME. 

68
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:39,292
HIS POLITICAL WINGMAN, CODENAME,

69
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,060
LITTLE JERK. 

70
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,131
YOU ALL HAVE YOUR NAMES AND YOU 

71
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,902
EARN THEM LIKE I DID. 

72
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,937
WHO WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO WALK IN 

73
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:55,141
HIS SHADOW AND WITNESS HISTORY 

74
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:56,176
OF CLOSE. 

75
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,611
TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GIANT

76
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,912
AT THE TIME EVERYTHING AROUND 

77
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:01,147
US WAS SO SMALL. 

78
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:02,515
WHAT DID I LEARN? 

79
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,818
A FEW DUMB JOKES TOLD OVER AND 

80
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,655
OVER ACTUALLY BECOME FUNNY. 

81
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,089
AND THEY CAN TAKE YOU A LONG 

82
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:15,395
WAY IN POLITICS, MARCO. 

83
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,030
I WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU BECAUSE 

84
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,666
JOHN MIGHT DO. 

85
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,100
LINDSAY, HOW HOT IS IT IN 

86
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,400
ARIZONA? 

87
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,702
JOHN, I DON'T KNOW. 

88
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,338
IT IS SO HOT THAT THE TREES 

89
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:31,811
CHASE THE DOGS. WHAT IS UNIQUE 

90
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:32,178
ABOUT ARIZONA? 

91
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,081
I DON'T KNOW, JOHN. 

92
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:36,649
BARRY GOLDWATER RAN FOR 

93
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:37,917
PRESIDENT A LOT, -- RAN FOR 

94
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:39,118
PRESIDENT AND LOSS. 

95
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,288
I RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND LOSS. 

96
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,690
IT IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE 

97
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,058
NATION WHERE MOTHERS TELL THEIR 

98
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:45,959
CHILDREN YOU CAN NEVER GROW UP 

99
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,160
TO BE PRESIDENT. 

100
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,429
JEFF, REMEMBER THAT. 

101
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,765
MAYBE YOU CAN BREAK THE STRING. 

102
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,168
LINDSAY, AREN'T YOU A LAWYER? 

103
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:57,904
I AM, JOHN. 

104
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,038
HE SAID YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE 

105
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,473
BETWEEN A LAWYER AND A CATFISH? 

106
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:00,873
NOW I DON'T. 

107
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:04,510
ONE IS A BOTTOM DWELLING SCUM 

108
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,079
SUCKING CREATURE AND THE OTHER 

109
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,447
IS A FISH. 

110
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,349
NO WONDER WE DID SO POORLY WITH 

111
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,216
LAWYERS, JOHN. 

112
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,850
DO YOU KNOW WHY I JOINED THE 

113
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,251
MARINES? 

114
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,287
I SAID NO. 

115
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,723
MY PARENTS WERE MARRIED. 

116
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:22,028
I'M GOING TO MISS THESE DUMB 

117
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:22,528
JOKES. 

118
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,064
WHAT ELSE DID I LEARN? 

119
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,033
I LEARNED HOW TO FIGHT, A LOT. 

120
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,335
EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY. 

121
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:33,373
I LEARNED HOW TO FORGIVE. AND 

122
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,542
FROM HIM I SAW HOW TO HEAL. 

123
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:42,615
ON THE -- SIDE I LEARNED THAT 

124
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,516
THE CAPTURED WARRIOR WHO WAS 

125
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:44,317
TORTURED BECAME THE STATESMAN 

126
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,352
WHO FOR GAVE AND HEALED THE 

127
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,186
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIS FORMER 

128
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:49,422
ADVERSARY AND OUR NATION. 

129
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:54,527
I WENT TO THE HANOI HILTON, ONE 

130
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:55,728
OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY LIFE, 

131
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,263
WITH JOHN, IT IS NOW A MUSEUM. 

132
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,265
WE ARE THE BAD GUYS BECAUSE 

133
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,568
THEY GET THEIR RIGHT ON HOW THE 

134
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,669
MUSEUM READS. 

135
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:04,937
I REMEMBER BEING IN FRONT OF 

136
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:06,806
HIS CELL AND YOU COULD SEE THE 

137
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,674
WHEELS TURNING AND THE MEMORIES 

138
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:11,144
COMING BACK. 

139
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,780
AS WE WALKED FORWARD, 

140
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,214
SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF 

141
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,252
HANDLERS, JOHN McCAIN WAS ELVIS 

142
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,820
IN VIETNAM, IT WAS THE MOST 

143
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,321
AMAZING THING IN THE WORLD HOW 

144
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:29,562
PEOPLE ADORED HIM IN VIETNAM. 

145
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:30,897
I SAW PHOTOS ON THE WALL OF 

146
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,497
PRISONERS PLAYING VOLLEYBALL, 

147
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,498
SITTING IN THE SUN WITH 

148
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,266
SUNGLASSES. 

149
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,168
I SAID JOHN, IT MUST NOT HAVE 

150
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,536
BEEN THAT BAD AFTER ALL. 

151
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,372
HE SAID, I DON'T REMEMBER IT 

152
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,273
THIS WAY. 

153
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:43,075
WHICH ALLOWED US TO GET OUT OF 

154
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:44,811
VIETNAM. 

155
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,314
I REMEMBER HIM EMBRACING A WAR 

156
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,516
THAT NOBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT

157
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,821
BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT 

158
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,589
WOULD COST TO LOSE IT. 

159
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,192
I REMEMBER HIM SUPPORTING THE 

160
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,561
SURGE WHEN EVERYBODY WAS 

161
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:02,995
WILLING TO GET OUT OF IRAQ 

162
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,697
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO TIRED OF IT

163
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,532
AND SAW NO WAY FORWARD. 

164
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,401
I REMEMBER THE FIGHTER. 

165
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:12,238
I REMEMBER THE 2008 CAMPAIGN, 

166
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,141
IN 2007 JOHN McCAIN WAS FIFTH 

167
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,577
IN A FOUR-PERSON RACE. 

168
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,045
WRITTEN OFF AS POLITICALLY 

169
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,080
DEAD, NO MONEY, STRAIGHT TALK 

170
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,519
EXPRESS HAD NO WHEELS. 

171
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,420
OUT OF SHEER DETERMINATION 

172
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,888
AFTER A VISIT TO IRAQ WERE 

173
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,023
GENERAL PETRAEUS ALLOWED HIM TO 

174
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:34,427
TALK IN JULY TO 600 PEOPLE WHO 

175
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,496
WERE GOING TO REENLIST IN A WAR 

176
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,364
THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO 

177
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,167
CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND ABOUT 

178
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:42,168
EQUAL NUMBER WERE BECOMING 

179
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,703
CITIZENS BECAUSE THEY WERE 

180
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,004
FIGHTING FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND 

181
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,206
THEY HAD EXPEDITED CITIZENSHIP. 

182
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,341
TWO EMPTY CHAIRS IN THE FRONT 

183
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:51,043
WITH BOOTS AND JOHN ASKED WHAT 

184
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:52,311
IS THAT ABOUT? 

185
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,080
TWO DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE 

186
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,148
CEREMONY BUT THEY WERE GIVEN 

187
00:06:56,148 --> 00:06:58,584
THEIR CITIZENSHIP THAT DAY. 

188
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,853
I REMEMBER ABOUT 2000 CHOUTEAU 

189
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,855
-- SOLDIERS WANTED A PHOTO AND 

190
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,357
EVERYONE GOT IT. 

191
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,460
I REMEMBER IT BEING SO HOT THAT 

192
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,994
I COULD NOT BREATHE BUT WE 

193
00:07:08,994 --> 00:07:10,630
STAYED. 

194
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,831
I REMEMBER COMING BACK AND 

195
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,332
GETTING THE NOMINATION ONLY TO 

196
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:13,633
LOSE. 

197
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:19,605
I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT VERY WELL.

198
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,140
HE WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT, HE 

199
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,941
WAS PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT, 

200
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,143
BUT IT WAS NOT HIS TO HAVE. 

201
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:29,415
I REMEMBER THE SPEECH HE GAVE 

202
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,918
THAT NIGHT. 

203
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,588
JOHN TAUGHT US HOW TO LOSE. 

204
00:07:35,588 --> 00:07:37,189
WHEN YOU GO THROUGHOUT THE 

205
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:39,191
WORLD, PEOPLE REMEMBER HIS 

206
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:43,162
CONCESSION SPEECH AS MUCH AS 

207
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,865
ANYTHING ELSE. 

208
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,766
THERE ARE SO MANY COUNTRIES 

209
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,000
WHERE YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE 

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,402
BECAUSE THEY KILL YOU. 

211
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:52,438
JOHN SAID THAT NIGHT, PRESIDENT 

212
00:07:52,438 --> 00:08:00,046
OBAMA IS NOW MY PRESIDENT. 

213
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,481
HE HEALED A NATION AT A TIME 

214
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,181
THAT HE WAS HURT. 

215
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:05,451
I REMEMBER LEARNING A CAUSE 

216
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:11,123
GREATER THAN YOURSELF HURTS. 

217
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,758
HE COULD NOT PUT HIS JACKET ON, 

218
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,793
HE COULD NOT COMB HIS HAIR 

219
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,562
BECAUSE HE GOT HURT SERVING A 

220
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:21,000
CAUSE GREATER THEN HIMSELF. 

221
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,435
I REMEMBER HOW EASY IT IS TO 

222
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:24,237
SAY AND HOW HARD IT IS TO DO. 

223
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:30,610
HOW HARD IT IS TO TELL TO FACE 

224
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:31,844
I THINK YOU ARE WRONG. 

225
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,845
HOW HARD IT IS TO SOLVE 

226
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,113
PROBLEMS THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTS 

227
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,616
TO TALK ABOUT. 

228
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,150
I LEARNED THAT FAILURE AND 

229
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,986
SUCCESS ARE THE DIFFERENT SIDES 

230
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,422
OF THE SAME COIN. 

231
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,958
JOHN TOLD ME I HAVE BECOME 

232
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,095
BETTER FROM FAILURES BECAUSE IT 

233
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:53,699
TEACHES US. WITHOUT MY FAILURES 

234
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,201
I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN 

235
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,470
SUCCESSFUL. 

236
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,138
FOR THOSE AS A YOUNG PERSON 

237
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,708
REMEMBER JOHN McCAIN HE FAILED 

238
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,444
A LOT BUT HE NEVER QUIT. 

239
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,579
THE REASON WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

240
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,848
HIM TODAY AND THE REASON I AM 

241
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:17,556
CRYING IS BECAUSE HE WAS 

242
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:18,224
SUCCESSFUL DESPITE HIS 

243
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,824
FAILURES. 

244
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:19,391
FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS, THE 

245
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:21,294
AFTER ACTION REPORT WOULD SAY A 

246
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,328
RELATIONSHIP WITH MAVERICK 

247
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,196
BROUGHT JOY AND DIFFICULTY. 

248
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,933
BOTH WERE A CONSTANT COMPANION. 

249
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,569
HE WAS A DIFFICULT MAN. 

250
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:36,575
HE COULD BE TOUGH. THE JOY THAT 

251
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:39,378
YOU RECEIVED FROM BEING WITH HIM

252
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:42,314
WILL SUSTAIN YOU FOR A LIFETIME.

253
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:44,917
I AM SO LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN IN 

254
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:49,722
HIS PRESENCE. 

255
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:50,957
HE TAUGHT ME THAT PRINCIPAL AND 

256
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:52,224
COMPROMISE ARE NOT MUTUALLY 

257
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:52,725
EXCLUSIVE. 

258
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,226
THE FOUNDATION OF A GREAT 

259
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:55,795
PERSON AS WELL IS A GREAT 

260
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,562
NATION. 

261
00:09:56,562 --> 00:10:00,032
HE TAUGHT ME THAT IMMIGRATION, 

262
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,569
AS HARD AS IT IS TO SOLVE, 

263
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,372
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO DO IT. 

264
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:10,876
HE SAID TO ME, WITH TED 

265
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,412
KENNEDY, YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN 

266
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,381
THAT THE OTHER SIDE HAS TO GET 

267
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,484
SOMETHING TO. 

268
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:21,320
I HAVE LEARNED THAT LESSON. 

269
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,256
TO MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE,

270
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:27,960
AS LONG AS I AM HERE I WILL 

271
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,628
REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE TO GET 

272
00:10:29,628 --> 00:10:30,496
SOMETHING TO. 

273
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,031
HE TOLD ME WHEN GOOD IGNORES 

274
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,100
EVIL IT MAY BE CONVENIENT, BUT 

275
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,871
IT SELDOM WORKS. 

276
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:39,905
HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD 

277
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:41,774
HAPPEN IN IRAQ IF WE LEFT, HE 

278
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:47,113
WAS RIGHT. 

279
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:48,114
HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD 

280
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,448
HAPPEN IN SYRIA IF WE DID NOT 

281
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:51,083
GET INVOLVED, HE WAS RIGHT. 

282
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:51,283
WHY? 

283
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,853
BECAUSE WARRIORS ARE THE BEST 

284
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,690
AT MAKING PEACE AND THE WARRIOR 

285
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,391
UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE 

286
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,793
BETWEEN A FALSE PEACE AND REAL 

287
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:03,095
PEACE. 

288
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:09,802
TO THOSE WHO ACCUSED HIM OF -- 

289
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,103
ENDLESS WARS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA 

290
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:12,004
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. 

291
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,474
HE WANTED SUSTAINABLE PEACE AND 

292
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:19,211
HE UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES 

293
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:23,482
OF NOT SEEING IT THROUGH. 

294
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:26,418
THE SOLDIERS ADORED HIM. 

295
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:27,786
TO THOSE WHO HAVE TRAVELED WITH 

296
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:31,691
JOHN, YOU SELDOM HAD TWO MEALS 

297
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,693
IN THE SAME COUNTRY. 

298
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,095
YOU MET MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU 

299
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,129
COULD REMEMBER BUT YOU WERE 

300
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,166
STRUCK BY ONE THING, WE WERE 

301
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:43,269
GOING TO BAD PLACES AND THOSE 

302
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,674
IN THE MILITARY ADORED THIS MAN.

303
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,076
HE TAUGHT ME THAT BOLDNESS AND 

304
00:11:51,076 --> 00:11:53,879
PRACTICALITY MUST BE PRACTICED 

305
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,681
IN EQUAL MEASURE. 

306
00:11:55,681 --> 00:12:00,352
HE BELIEVES IN CLIMATE CHANGE, 

307
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,588
AND SODA WHY. 

308
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,023
THERE IS A PRACTICAL STREAK 

309
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:09,929
ABOUT JOHN THAT I THINK MADE 

310
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:10,830
HIM VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HE 

311
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,464
TOLD ME TIME AND TIME AGAIN, 

312
00:12:12,464 --> 00:12:14,433
YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE CATCH UP 

313
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,135
WITH YOU. 

314
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,703
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RHYTHM AND A 

315
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:17,903
PACE. 

316
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,973
THERE ARE 100 PEOPLE IN THIS 

317
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:21,974
BODY FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF 

318
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:22,174
LIFE. 

319
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,544
YOU MAY THINK YOU ARE RIGHT AND 

320
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:27,479
OVER TIME IF YOU ARE IT WILL BE 

321
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:27,880
PROVEN. 

322
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,882
BUT GIVE YOUR COLLEAGUES THE 

323
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:33,352
TIME AND UNDERSTANDING TO CATCH 

324
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,488
UP WITH YOU. 

325
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,158
HE TAUGHT ME THAT HONOR AND 

326
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,526
IMPERFECTION ARE ALWAYS IN 

327
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:42,828
COMPETITION. 

328
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:49,168
I DO NOT CRY FOR A PERFECT MAN. 

329
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:55,407
I CRY FOR MAN WHO HAD ON AND 

330
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,708
WAS WILLING TO ADMIT HIS 

331
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,779
IMPERFECTION. 

332
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,680
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF GETTING 

333
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,181
INTO POLITICS. 

334
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,616
THE ONE THING I WOULD ASK YOU 

335
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,151
TO LOOK AT WHEN IT COMES TO THE 

336
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,452
LIFE OF JOHN McCAIN, IT IS OKAY 

337
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,521
TO TELL PEOPLE, I SCREWED UP. 

338
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:12,391
I GOT THIS WRONG. 

339
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,528
I WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. 

340
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:19,832
HONOR IS, IN MY VIEW, DOING THE 

341
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:24,069
RIGHT THING AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE.

342
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:29,008
HE DID THAT TIME AND TIME AND 

343
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:29,508
TIME AGAIN. 

344
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:30,643
HE TAUGHT ME THAT LIFE WITHOUT 

345
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,480
PASSION AND LOVE IS A SAD LIFE. 

346
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,683
HE HAD A HAPPY LIFE. 

347
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:45,391
HE HAD 10 LIVES. HE WAS 

348
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,624
INVOLVED IN FIVE AVIATION 

349
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:50,062
ACCIDENTS. 

350
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,797
IF WE SENT HIM A BILL FOR ALL 

351
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,998
THE PLANES HE CRASHED HE COULD 

352
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,233
NEVER PAY IT OFF. 

353
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,769
HE LIVED LIFE TO ITS FULLEST. 

354
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,872
HE WAS OFTEN DISAPPOINTED, BUT 

355
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:03,843
HE WAS NEVER DETOURED FROM 

356
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,577
GETTING BACK UP AND GOING AT IT 

357
00:14:05,577 --> 00:14:11,550
AGAIN. LOVE, NOT A WORD OFTEN 

358
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,718
ASSOCIATED WITH SENATOR McCAIN. 

359
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,720
IT SHOULD BE. 

360
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,889
IF YOU ARE LOVED BY HIM YOU 

361
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:19,091
KNEW IT. 

362
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,893
YOU WERE LOVED WITH ALL OF YOUR 

363
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:24,096
FAULTS AND I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE 

364
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:29,168
BEEN LOVED BY HIM. 

365
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,170
HOW WOULD I CHARACTERIZE 

366
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,539
OPERATION MAVERICK? 

367
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,641
WILDLY SUCCESSFUL. 

368
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,142
IT MADE THE WORLD A BETTER 

369
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:39,144
PLACE. 

370
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,879
IT GAVE THE NATION SOMETHING TO 

371
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,484
TALK ABOUT AT A TIME WHEN WE 

372
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:46,552
CAN'T AGREE ON ANYTHING. 

373
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,988
NOT UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE 

374
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,823
LIFE OF JOHN McCAIN BUT PRETTY 

375
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:51,924
CLOSE. 

376
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:56,495
THE ONLY TIME MSNBC, CNN AND 

377
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:59,865
FOX ARE SAYING THE SAME THING. 

378
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:05,103
THE ONLY WAY THAT HAPPENED IS 

379
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:09,641
BECAUSE THOSE OF US WHO HAD THE 

380
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:10,775
PLEASURE OF BEING IN HIS 

381
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:15,147
PRESENCE, AND THOSE WHO COVERED 

382
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:19,251
HIM IN YOUR BUSINESS WANT TO 

383
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,755
TELL THE STORY. I 

384
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:27,359
HAVEN'T BEEN APPROACHED SINCE 

385
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,827
-- I HAVE BEEN APPROACHED SINCE 

386
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,063
HIS DEATH BY CABDRIVERS, 

387
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,731
WAITERS, COPS AND THEY SAY 

388
00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:36,001
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. 

389
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:41,440
MY NAME IS GRAHAM, NOT McCAIN. 

390
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,745
BUT I FEEL LIKE A McCAIN. 

391
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,347
I DO NOT KNOW IF I HAVE EARNED 

392
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:53,218
THAT HONOR BUT I FEEL LIKE IT. 

393
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:54,653
THE AVERAGE MAN AND WOMAN IN 

394
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,489
THIS COUNTRY GOT JOHN McCAIN. 

395
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,957
WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THE 

396
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:02,928
FUTURE? 

397
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,829
IT MEANS THERE WILL BE 

398
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:04,496
GENERATIONS OF POLITICIANS 

399
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,764
COMING ALONG WHO WILL BE 

400
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:06,197
INFLUENCED BY HIM. 

401
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:08,233
THE McCAIN INSTITUTE IS ALIVE 

402
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,803
AND WELL. 

403
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,137
IT'S GOAL IS TO GET YOUNG 

404
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,839
LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE 

405
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,307
DEVELOPING WORLD, EXPOSE THEM 

406
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,944
TO DEMOCRACY, TEACH THEM THE 

407
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,445
ART OF COMPROMISE, THE RULE OF 

408
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:28,187
LAW, AND WHAT A LEGACY. 

409
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:34,093
JOHN WILL INSPIRE COURAGE HE 

410
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:35,294
WILL REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT 

411
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:38,664
NOTHING IS INEVITABLE AS LONG 

412
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,065
AS A FEW PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO 

413
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:41,599
FIGHT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS 

414
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,535
RIGHT. 

415
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,738
IT IS GOING TO BE A LONELY 

416
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:52,544
JOURNEY FOR A WHILE. 

417
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:55,214
I WILL NEED YOUR HELP. 

418
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,183
AND THE VOID TO BE FILLED BY 

419
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,819
JOHN'S PASSING IS MORE THAN I 

420
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,155
CAN DO. 

421
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,924
DON'T LOOK TO BE TO REPLACE 

422
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:08,594
THIS MAN. 

423
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:13,898
LOOK TO ME TO REMEMBER WHAT HE 

424
00:17:13,898 --> 00:17:15,666
WAS ABOUT AND TRY TO FOLLOW IN 

425
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,769
