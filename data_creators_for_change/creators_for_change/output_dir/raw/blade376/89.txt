4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,380
to get home each day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm just very</font>

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,509
stressed at the moment especially the

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:15,000
last couple of weeks I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get home from</font>

7

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,010
myself a glass water then go straight to

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">bed and let the cycle repeat um and I've</font>

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,680
organize decade a lot of issues there

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,650
got death in the family just problems

13
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,930
like everyone else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has in the world will</font>

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,760
pain and stress is relative so I'm

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
trying to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it in my own way but</font>

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,469
um as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat on the stairs looking</font>

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,629
through the mail I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got this letter and</font>

20
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,820
it really speaks for itself so I'm just

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,770
going to read it but I'm afterwards I

22
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,360
was just sat on the stairs for about 10

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,000
minutes and tears it took my breath away

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,359
and I decided not to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed straight</font>

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,600
away and set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> my camera and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just read</font>

day either<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what really touches</font>

57
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,480
me about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is is just the whole thing</font>

58
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,120
about being human language and the fact

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,210
that we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to connect because</font>

60
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,620
they made the effort to speak the same

61
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,350
language as me and it kind of just goes

62
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">with my philosophy about life that if</font>

63
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,810
everyone spoke the same language or had

64
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,760
true understanding of what each other's

65
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,380
intentions were and we were able to

66
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">openly convey how we were feeling</font>

67
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,020
