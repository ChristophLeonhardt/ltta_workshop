Sometimes, a strange
kind of crop sprouts
in the sandy bottom
of the Red Sea —
eels.
These garden eels
grow up to 3 feet long,
and about a
half-inch in diameter.
They live in holes in the
sea floor, into which they
can retreat at any
hint of a predator.
Even when they’re feeding on
tiny animals called zooplankton,
they stay anchored
in the sand.
They secrete a kind of mucus
that helps them stay put.
But why stay anchored
if you can swim?
And they can
if they want to.
Wouldn’t that get
you more food?
Apparently not.
In low current,
they stretch out
and snatch any prey
within reach in any direction.
In a faster current,
when free-swimming fish
have trouble
chasing prey, the eels
adopt a question mark shape.
That lets them hold steady
and still feed on plankton
as they sweep by.
An analysis by
researchers found
the drag on their bodies
was up to four times less
than it would have been
if they were straight up —
that is, when the researchers
could find the eels.
This shapeshifting talent
has allowed these eels
to colonize the sandy sea floor,
where other fish have
trouble getting a grip.
Sometimes, the stay-at-homes
get all the good plankton.
