ROB: USING FOSTER HOMES TO
GET OUR VETERANS AROUND THE
CLOCK ASSISTANCE.
JILLIAN: 27-MILLION-DOLLAR A
YEAR PROGRAM PROVIDES
HOUSING AND CARE FOR 1,000
VETERANS IN 42 STATES AND
THE V.A. ONLY ACCEPTS FOSTER
HOMES THAT MEET STRICT
QUALIFICATIONS.
SO, IS THIS A GOOD IDEA?
HERE NOW TO WEIGH IN IS
LIEUTENANT COLONEL JIM
REESE.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US
THIS MORNING.
WE APPRECIATE IT WHAT DO YOU
THINK?
DO YOU LIKE THIS IDEA?
>> I DO.
I THINK THE V.A. RIGHT NOW
WITH EVERYBODY COMING BACK
FROM THE AFGHAN IRAQ WARS
AND INFLUX OF VETERANS WE
HAVE, I LIKE THIS IDEA.
I THINK IT'S A GREAT NEW
INITIATIVE.
I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS
IS WITH THIS BIG GOVERNMENT
BUREAUCRACY CALLED THE
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION.
WHY HAVE GOT TO DO SOME
CHANGE LEADERSHIP.
WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME NEW
PROGRAMS.
AND THIS IS NOT A NEW
PROGRAM.
THIS HAS BEEN A PILOT
PROGRAM THAT'S GONE ON FOR
SEVERAL YEARS.
IT'S HAD SOME GOOD SUCCESS
AND NOW THEY WANT TO EXPAND
ON IT SO I DO LIKE IT.
ROB: YOU SAY THIS WILL
RESULT IN BETTER, CLOSER
CARE FOR THESE VETERANS THAT
NEED IT IN THESE FOSTER
HOMES.
YOU SAY THIS WON'T COST THE
VETERAN THEMSELVES ANY MORE
MONEY TO GET THIS BETTER
CARE?
>> YEAH.
IT'S -- I TRULY BELIEVE THAT
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE
VETERANS THAT WOULD MAYBE
JUST SIT IN A FOSTER -- I'M
SORRY, THAT WOULD SIT IN A
HOME AND THEY GET PERIODIC
CARE BY, YOU KNOW, A NURSE
OR SOME TYPE OF MEDICAL
PROVIDER IN THESE HOMES,
WHAT THIS DOES HERE IS THEY
GET INTO A HOME, THEY MIGHT
ONLY HAVE ONE OR TWO OTHER
VETERANS THAT ARE WITH THEM
AND THEY GET TO BE PART OF
THIS FAMILY AND IT'S REALLY
SUPPORT OF A GREAT
PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECT.
SO I THINK IT BRINGS BETTER
HOLISTIC APPROACH TO MEDICAL
ASPECT FOR THESE PEOPLE.
JILLIAN: ARE YOU SEEING
IMPROVEMENT AND PERHAPS
BETTER WAYS OF VETERANS
BEING CARED FOR AND TREATED
RIGHT NOW?
>> YOU KNOW, I'M 80%
DISABLED VET.
I HAVE -- I DO UNDERSTAND
THE V.A.
I KNOW THE V.A. IS WORKING
VERY HARD DAILY TO TRY TO
IMPROVE WHAT THEY ARE DOING
FOR VETERANS.
BUT I STILL THINK IT CAN BE
IMPROVED.
I THINK PROGRAMS LIKE THIS
AND NEW CREATIVE IDEAS WILL
KIND OF BREAK UP THIS
BUREAUCRACY AND GIVE
VETERANS BETTER CARE,
ESPECIALLY AFTER LEARNING
FROM THE VIETNAM WAR WHAT
THESE NEW IRAQI AFGHAN VETS
WILL LEARN FROM ALL THE
YEARS OF SUPPORTING THE
VIETNAM WAR VETERAN.
ROB: WE HAVE HEARD THE
HORROR STORIES OF THE THINGS
THAT HAVE GONE ON AT V.A.
HOSPITALS.
WE SEEN THE STORIES TIME AND
TIME AGAIN.
THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO
SIGN THIS VETERANS CHOICE
BILL.
ALLOWING VETERANS TO GET
PRIVATE CARE IF THEY CHOOSE
TO DO SO.
HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT FOR
PEOPLE COMING BACK TO THESE
WARS TO SEE THAT SOMEBODY
REALLY DOES CARE TO DO THIS,
TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS.
>> YEAH.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
I MEAN, WE LIVE IN SUCH A
DIFFERENT TIME.
WITH THE INFORMATION AGE AND
VETERANS ARE ALLOWED TO COME
BACK AND, YOU KNOW, THE
TRANSPORTATION HUBS TODAY.
SO VETERANS ARE GOING
FARTHER AWAY FROM WHERE
THESE V.A. CENTERS ARE.
SO THIS WILL HELP VETERANS
THAT MIGHT BE 50 MILES OR
MORE OR HAVE TO FLY OR GET
SITE.
THIS WILL HELP THEM GET
BETTER CARE.
I'M A BIG PROPONENT.
I THINK YOU CAN BREAK DOWN
SOME OF THESE -- THE OLD
BRING AND MORTAR TYPE V.A.S
AND GET THEM PUSHED OUT TO
BETTER MEDICAL CARE WHICH
WILL REDUCE THE COST OF THE
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION.
ROB: THAT'S PART OF IT, TOO.
SOME CAN BE REPAIRED.
