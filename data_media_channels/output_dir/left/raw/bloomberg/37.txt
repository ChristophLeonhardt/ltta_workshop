1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,400
When you think about people who shaped the World Cup,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,780
Pele or Maradona may spring to mind.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,380
But how about Chuck Blazer, the American former FIFA executive who admitted to taking heaps of bribes?

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,900
Partly as a result of Blazer's testimony,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,700
and the wiretaps he wore, sweeping international investigations have led to

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,620
the arrest and conviction of dozens of corrupt soccer officials, including Blazer himself.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,800
 

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,300
 

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,880
 

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,940
Thatâ€™s Ken Bensinger, an author and investigative journalist who wrote this book on the scandal.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,860
In May 2015, Swiss police raided  a five-star hotel in Zurich

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,640
and arrested top executives from the International Federation of Association Football, or FIFA.

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,820
 

14
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:51,895
 

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,940
 

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,580
The World Cup, and soccer in general, had become such big business

17
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,440
that executives were being offered huge bribes to help ensure certain companies won media contracts -

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,440
or to vote for a particular country to host the World Cup.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,955
 

20
00:01:08,955 --> 00:01:10,615
 

21
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:12,755
 

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,660
 

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,940
Blazer had done particularly well from his dodgy dealings.

24
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,760
He reportedly bought himself: A $900,000 beachside condo in the Bahamas,

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:30,020
two South Beach apartments, a hummer, hundreds of first class flights to and from Europe

26
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,280
and a suite in Trump Tower for himself and another reportedly just for his pets.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,175
But like Al Capone, Blazer's undoing was tax evasion.

28
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,500
He struck a deal with the FBI and provided live information for a year and a half

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:47,220
while still on FIFA's all-powerful executive committee, known as Ex-Co.

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,535
They were the two dozen or so men who decided, in secret, who gets to hold the World Cup -

31
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,340
a decision with billions of dollars in media rights and infrastructure projects hanging on it.

32
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,835
 

33
00:01:59,835 --> 00:02:00,665
 

34
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:03,005
 

35
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:04,220
 

36
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:08,360
Blazer alleged that the vote to give South Africa the 2010 World Cup was rigged.

37
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,080
He also took part in the most contentious decisions of all:

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
a double vote in 2010 that handed this year's event to Russia

39
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,540
and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a tiny but rich gulf state with little soccer pedigree.

40
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:28,260
Swiss, U.S. and French prosecutors are still investigating allegations of bribery surrounding those votes.

41
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:34,080
Of the Ex-Co members from 2010, most are now either banned from soccer or facing investigation.

42
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,660
In the U.S., some $300 million from around two dozen guilty parties has been collected so far.

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,260
Six of them former Ex-Co members, including Blazer.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,640
Blazer pleaded guilty to 10 corruption charges. But he died in 2017 before sentencing.

45
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,420
As part of a clean-up operation to restore credibility, FIFA removed the power to award World Cups from the Ex-Co

46
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,560
and handed it to its 200 or so national members.

47
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,220
 

48
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:04,445
 

49
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:07,315
 

50
00:03:07,315 --> 00:03:09,765
 

51
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:12,640
 

52
00:03:13,980 --> 00:00:00,000
In June, FIFA's members chose the U.S., Canada and Mexico to host the 2026 tournament.
