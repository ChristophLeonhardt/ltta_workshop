my name is Pete Souza I was the chief official White House photographer for President Obama and my new book Obama and intimate portrait just came out on the day of the bin Laden raid the president in his national security team piled into this very tiny conference room within the Situation Room complex to monitor the raid as it happened I chose one corner of the room to be in there and because there were so many people I couldn't really move around during those 40 minutes and so I was able to photograph as they all watched this raid unfold there's very little conversation taking place there was just observation as they watched the Special Forces on the ground when the president walked into this little conference from him there was a brigadier general sitting at the head of the table and he stood up to give the president that chair and president said no no no you stay there because he was on his laptop in communication with the with Admiral McRaven and the president just pulled up a folding black chair and sat next to it the picture itself was taken towards the back end of of the raid it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when that was but I suspect it was when they were the Special Forces or inside the house and there was no video of what was occurring inside the house so that I think they're waiting to see what would happen throughout the 40 minutes in that room it was very tense and anxious you can see that on their faces and when the word came over that Geronimo ki a meaning Geronimo was bin Laden's code name for this mission that he was killed in action I think there was a sense of happiness and resolve but there was no like high fives or cheering or anything like that president stood up at the end and shook hands with a few people but it was almost anti-climatic and actually somewhat solemn when this head and when this ended
