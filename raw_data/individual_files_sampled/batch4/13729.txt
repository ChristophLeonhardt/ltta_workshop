so let's talk about Roseann for some reason Roseann as I'm sure you her you've heard has been canceled because Roseann the person went on a bizarre deranged tweet storm that included a racist tweet and it was a really racist tweet I mean actually racist there's a definite boy who cried wolf thing that goes on with racist claims where everybody's accused of being racist and everything is racist and so on and so forth but in this case there's there's a wolf there's a there's a real wolf here because this was actually racist Roseanne tweeted this was her tweet Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes had a baby BJ as in DJ was the baby and BJ refers to Valerie Jarrett who's Obama's former White House adviser and she's a black woman now some conservatives on Twitter have really embarrassed themselves by trying to defend Roseanne on the basis that Valerie Jarrett is not actually black and so it's not racist to say she's from Planet of the Apes but she is definitely actually black and I mean I've even seen I've seen people passing around photos of Valerie Jarrett where she where her skin has been lightened in the photo through Photoshop in order to defend Roseanne I mean this is just it's really pathetic she's not only is she a black woman but she's clearly black there's not it's I I'm no Rose I'm not a Valerie Jarrett biographer okay what I know very few things about her in fact what I just said is everything I know about her I know she was a former White House adviser and she's a black woman and I know that she's a black woman because I've seen her and if you do actually investigate her her lineage you'll find that both of her parents were black so she's and in fact she apparently even has her maternal grandfather was a prominent black architect or something like that I believe so she's definitely black and no way around it Roseanne said that and she's obviously black and Roseanne says she's from Planet of the Apes and she was also now to put this in fully in context Valerie Jarrett was also born in Iran so you've got a black woman born in Iran and Roseanne says that she's the love child of the Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes that is super super hyper racism on steroids that's that is the if that's not a racist comment then it is impossible to make a racist coven racist comments don't exist if that is not a racist comment I I don't know how else to put it there's no justifying that there's no claiming it's now raises it is okay and it it's not this is one thing people are not playing a gotcha game with Roseann where they're jumping on some innocent comment and trying to make it no this is she said that a black woman's from Planet of the Apes and so you know just don't say that it's it's a really easy thing to not say right most of us can go through our whole lives and never say that a black person is from Planet of the Apes it's a really easy thing to not say and if you don't think it if you don't think that way then you probably would never say it and especially should be easy as for Rosanna's or whatever 65 year old wealthy multi-millionaire prominent woman who's getting paid millions of dollars from from ABC to do a show you know I think ABC expects her to not go on a public forum and say racist stuff and that's not a that's it that's a pretty reasonable expectation just don't do that don't say that why would you say that you've got hundreds of people that are relying on you for a job think about all the people that work on Roseanne and now they're out of a job not because of ABC because of Roseanne because she's mentally unbalanced and selfish and so she can't control herself you know this is her fault 100% the firing makes a lot of sense I'm sorry guys this is not a it's not a free speech issue Roseanne is not a martyr okay she's not being persecuted she brought this entirely on herself 100% roseann because she's loony put her employers in a position where they had to choose this is this is the position that her employers rent they had to choose between defending slash minimizing her statements comparing a black woman to the Planet of the Apes on one hand they could do that and this is a major company in the year 2018 reliant on sponsors and advertisers and so they're thinking they can get in that corner okay and try to make that argument that died on that hill or they could just fire her and they chose the latter and you know something that's a perfectly sensible thing to do and I'll tell you this if it were my employee and I'm paying them millions of dollars and then they go in a public forum and say crap like that I would definitely fire them I wouldn't even have to think about it of course you're gonna fire them it's not my responsibility as an employer to defend you on that it's your responsibility as someone getting paid millions of dollars by me to not embarrass me like that and to not cause a PR nightmare where I could lose millions of dollars it's your responsibility to not do that and you couldn't even fulfill it so get out of here you're done any sensible businessperson would make the same decision and I know you're gonna say well shoot millions people were watching her show she's got a good you know what they're gonna find another show that's gonna do fine and most of the people that are saying they're gonna boycott ABC and Disney they won't do it they just won't they'll you know if there's another show most of people right now say I'm done with ABC Roseanne's not on ABC yeah you know what with if ABC has a show next week announces a new show and you think it's interesting you'll watch it everybody's going oh just what you know people just if people want to watch something they're gonna watch it it doesn't matter now and and by the way just just to say one thing I think this is important it would be different I think it would be different if if let's say Roseann had made a comment like this a long time ago she'd made a joke like this and somebody went on a dirt digging expedition and dug this up to try to destroy her and they you know went sifting through and they went through the effort to go find this thing from a long time ago and use it against her and let's say that were to happen and then this is brought to the forefront and Roseanne's embarrassed and she apologizes that she says yeah that was a long time ago I I regret it you know I made jokes like that I've grown since then I'm not that kind of person anymore I'm you know I'm at all I'm a 65 year old woman now this is that's not who I am anymore if that's how it had gone then I would probably be on Roseanne side I would say look you know you can't people make mistakes is a long time ago and and and she's moved on since then she's grown so no I don't think you should take her past sins and hang them around her neck but that's not what happened this is something she just said yesterday publicly in front of everybody and she said she's making excuses for it now now she said she was on ambien and that's why she said it so she has not taken she said it publicly yesterday and she it won't even take ownership of it she refused to take ownership she's saying that she was on ambien and that's our excuse so you know what can you do this is you have no choice but to just fire her now I think this story serves or should serve anyway as a cautionary tale for conservatives um and to understand why let's back up for a moment okay let's back up to the but let's let's go back to the 90s okay to understand um picture in the foot context so in the 90s Roseann was one of the most left-wing sitcoms in the history of American television if not probably the most left-wing in fact at the time it promoted abortion it promoted gay marriage it was blatant in its agenda ahead of its time in that regard now it's not so unusual to find shows that promote those things of course but back then it was unusual so Roseann was not oh not only a leftist sitcom but it was a radically leftist sitcom and it was ahead of the curve in terms of its leftism so that's the show then it ends and Roseanne the person goes on to become a far left political activist she runs for president as a socialist she's an avowed socialist she champions left-wing causes she was so mad at chick-fil-a because its CEO supports traditional marriage that she tweeted a few years ago when I quote anyone anyone who eats crap filet well she didn't use craps use the S word so yeah anyone who eats chick-fil-a deserves to get cancer anyone who eats chick-fil-a is does it deserves to get the cancer that is short to come from eating antibiotic filled tortured chickens for Christ so she tweeted just to recap there okay she tweeted that that the Christian conservatives who eat chick-fil-a deserve to get cancer and then when she was criticized for this she lashed out at the Christian liars who were attacking her she never actually apologized for the tweet and in fact what she did is she backtracked and she made an excuse and she later claimed okay she later claimed that she she wasn't saying that anyone deserves to get cancer what she was trying to do was she was trying to warn us of the of the the negative health effects of eating fast food she was trying to warn us of the health impact of eating fast food that's what she was claiming that tweet was about so she has a pattern of not only saying vile disgusting things but of refusing to take ownership of them and refusing to have the moral courage to own them and to apologize for them and instead coming up with lame ridiculous excuses the kind of excuses that a twelve-year-old would come up with that's the pattern of behavior for Roseanne that goes back years and then there's a few years of this guy so just remember by the way if you're a Christian conservative and you and you like chick-fil-a you support trishul traditional marriage and you also love Roseann just remember that she wants you to get cancer that's what she said so she thinks you should get cancer that's her opinion about you so I don't know I mean that baby is a relevant point a few years of this stuff continues and then during the 2016 campaign Roseanne randomly says that she likes Trump of all the things that she's rambling about nonsensically that's one of the things that she happens to say although her left-wing convictions still remain intact she likes Trump and suddenly this woman who has spent a career spewing far-left lunacy all over the place and and promoting and mainstreaming far-left ideas this woman who has wished cancer on Christian conservatives now becomes a hero of conservatives simply because she likes Trump and then the new show was announced and in the first episode of the new show there's a storyline involving a cross-dressing 9 year old so there's no it's not like she has a chance she's had a change of heart and she's changed and she's grown and the show's gonna be different now and everything and and this what used to be a far left show is now gonna be a conservative Family Values show no it's still far left it is still actually ahead of its time and it's far left miss cross-dressing nine-year-olds on a family sitcom is still unusual so again Roseanne is ahead of the curve on on the Left ISM but still conservatives some of them anyway champion this show in spite of the gross perverted sexual ization of children all because Roseanne likes Trump that's it that's all it takes every nothing else matters she just likes Trump and some of the people that have this attitude they said well I've forgiven Roseann it's it's forgiveness no it's not forgiveness if she didn't like Trump you wouldn't be saying any of the stuff you're saying right now be honest don't tell me it's because you've forgiven her it's because she likes Travis the only reason if everything else stayed the same with Roseann but she didn't like Trump you'd hate her you wouldn't you would be watching the show you would support her it's only because of the Trump thing is that's the only reason that's it so then that happens within roseanne proceeds to say racist stuff so you what did conservatives achieve by latching on to a celebrity who happened to uh Terr one thing they agreed with what did conservatives achieve nothing I'm afraid this they embarrassed themselves that's what they achieved they embarrassed themselves we are embarrassed now and somehow you've got this far left person who says something racist and now suddenly we have to take ownership of that that's our thing now when it shouldn't be this is a far left comedian why is why is this our thing becomes our thing because for some ridiculous reason we latched on to her and so we're embarrassed and that is generally what happens when conservatives you know with with conservatives and they're desperate sad pitiful celebrity infatuation this is generally what happens whenever we cling on to any famous person who says one single thing we agree with we end up looking stupid and whether it's because Roseanne says something racist or because we invite Clint Eastwood to the Republican National Convention and he yells at a chair for 45 minutes we always end up looking ridiculous and so maybe we should stop doing this you you know maybe maybe it's we should look at a different strategy here's the problem I think we seem to believe and I keep using the word we I realize I I'm talking about conservatives generally of which I guess I am apart although conservatism is is now such a meaningless term that I don't even know how I can associate myself with it but just for the sake of argument I'm talking about conservatism generally so here's the problem we seem to believe that the way to defeat the left is to copy it that's what we're doing where we are like the pitiful little sad little little brother you know who sees his older brother and just imitates starts dressing like I mean imitates everything he does and so we treat the left like our older brothers and so we're just copying everything they do and then pretending that we're beating them somehow that way you see we beat the left by becoming them haha yes yeah come in did you so we see that they have a bunch of celebrities on their side and we think that well that means we need to get us some celebrities but the problem is that they have cool celebrities on their side okay they have like LeBron James and we have Roseanne who isn't even really on our side and we have we have Roseanne and we have I don't know James woods and one of the Baldwin brothers I think and Scott Baio okay those are those are our people I think the Liberals have all the cool ones and we have this is our collection of misfits that we that we've that we've brought together so it doesn't work we aren't going to beat the left at its own game we aren't going to out celebrity them and we should stop trying now it's it's one thing don't confuse what I'm saying here because if we do find a piece of pop culture art like a film or a television show or music or whatever that really does effectively convey a truthful essential message then we should champion we shouldn't go overboard we shouldn't become groupies but we should support it but roseanne is emphatically not that show first of all it's just a bad it's a stupid show second it's it's a vehicle for left-wing values that's what it's always been and still is or was anyway so it's not in any way the kind of thing that we should be supporting it's not it this is a vehicle for left-wing values not for conservative values whatever those are at this point on the rare occasion that we get something like a movie or show that is that is really different and and and champions what we might call conservative values quote unquote then I think yeah we should support just an example is my wife and I just a couple nights ago my wife and I went to see the movie a quiet place which I think has and you know it's been out for a while now it's very popular movie and I agree with what many other people have said about the film that even though on one level it just seems like your standard sci-fi horror film it actually I think has some very profound and beautiful pro-life pro-family Pro faith themes and on top of that it's just a well done effective skillfully crafted and executed film and it's also entertaining and so in that case yeah I think we go support a movie like that a movie that shows this family bonded together by faith the man in this protector role the woman as a strong but feminine character and you know just a debts that's something that I think we should support so I do think that pop culture and movies and film they are they are very powerful way to get across a message um problem comes when we latch on to literally any pop-culture property that even vaguely sort of dimly echoes a few right wing talking points that's the problem we just end up discrediting ourselves and we come across in the mean time also like we have horrible taste which I don't think helps our case either but the point remains we are not going to win the culture with celebrity especially not with these celebrities okay especially not with Roseanne but we won't win with with with celebrity regardless even if we had some of the cool ones we still would we still wouldn't win that way I think we win the culture if it's going to be won at all we win it by being radical and firm in our convictions we win by being authentic genuine thoughtful intelligent we win by sticking to the truth by being adults okay we don't win by debasing ourselves by desperately defending whatever racist crap Roseanne says that's that's not how we win we don't win anything we just make ourselves look ridiculous and we convinced precisely no one what exactly is being won by by rallying around Roseanne what what does that achieve at all what are we helping who are we convincing you now you might say you might say well truth and dignity and moral values they haven't won yet Matt they're losing so what are you talking about you can't win that way yeah they haven't won because so few of us actually care about those things or fight for them that's why they haven't won because we've given up on them we haven't even tried to fight for them most of us don't even try to fight but we've just given up most of the things you know that when it comes to being really pro-life and pro-family and pro marriage most so-called conservatives have given up on that they don't even try to fight for it and then they and then they rationalize and they reason and they say they say oh it's because it's a failure it's not winning well you haven't even tried why don't you get up and fight first why don't you give it a shot before you tell me you can't be done before you surrender why don't you actually get up off of your butt and actually try to fight for these things don't sit there and tell me that it's not working or I can't win that way and let me tell you something if we have actually gotten to a point in our culture where truth and morality and dignity can't win well then it's done we're finished in that case and so what's the point then at that point you may as well retain your own dignity for yourself and your family you may as well hold on to that and worry and and and you know if everything's collapsing all around us then you may as well hold on to your own dignity in your own moral sense because it's all falling apart anyway and there's no advantage in just abandoning that at the last moment and we also have to ask ourselves you know what does it mean to win we keep using this phrase winning winning well how do we win um I don't think we win by winning is not electing Republicans plenty of Republicans have been elected over the last many decades and yet the culture is still on the trajectory that it's on I think we win fundamentally by building a culture that is grounded in objective truth moral values and faith and fortified by strong families that's what it means to win nuf there's no there's no other winning that's winning that can actually be achieved at this point I don't know I'm a little bit pessimistic in that regard but if I'm gonna if we're gonna go down I'm gonna go down swinging I don't know about you that's what it means to win that's what we should be fighting for and the way this ties in to roseanne is that defending Roseanne and latching on to Roseanne and these dumb celebrities that doesn't help advance that cause at all in fact it undermines it it hugely undermines it especially when you're latching onto celebrities who for the last many many many years of their career have only been contributing to the cultural decay which is what Roseanne has spent her entire career doing and is still doing she is a part of the problem pray for her yes but don't stand in her corner all right and there's you know look there's better shows out there anyway there aren't a lot of good shows but there are a few decent ones so maybe watch one of those and and if there's ever time when we turn on the TV and there are no good shows and it's just a bunch of trash well then we could turn the TV off and read a book you know that's that's also an option I think of a very very worthwhile option as well so thanks for watching thanks for listening everybody Godspeed
