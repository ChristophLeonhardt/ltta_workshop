1
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:37,479
"Lumen" operates as an environment.
It's integrated with its context.

2
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,640
It's not an object.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,859
So what you see here is the
main courtyard, which

4
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:56,830
features the largest
canopy within "Lumen."

5
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:02,969
"Lumen" is a project that is
composed of thousands of digitally knitted

6
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,568
cells and stalactite conical
forms, which you can see here.

7
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:11,430
In the interest of creating
multiple experiences,

8
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,430
and transformation of
materiality within "Lumen,"

9
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,219
an additional aspect that inspires
change and different types of uses

10
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:22,360
is the misting system.

11
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,580
So you can actually hear it
and see the nozzles within

12
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,530
the conical forms,
misting and providing

13
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,080
a sort of cool microclimate on
hot days.

14
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:39,510
And the photoluminescent threads
are also responsive.

15
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,069
If you were to come back at night,
the photoluminescent threads would

16
00:01:43,069 --> 00:00:00,000
glow or emit knitted light.
