Laura: HIGH-STAKES TRAUMA CAN HAVE LAUGHS. THE PRESIDENT'S CANDID QUIPS. HERE IS RAYMOND ARROYO. COMMENTS ABOUT PHYSICAL APPEARANCE. SPEAK WITH THE PRESIDENT GETS UP AND THEY ARE TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS AND HE SAYS THIS TO KIM JONG UN. WATCH CLOSELY. VERY NICE. GETTING A GOOD PICTURE EVERYBODY SO WE LOOK HANDSOME AND THIN? LAUGHTER Laura: HE LOOKS THRILLED. KIM JONG UN IS THINKING DID HE SAY THIS TO THERESA MAY? IT'S AN EXAMPLE OF TRUMP, THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE BACK AND FORTH, DOMINATING KIM JONG UN. THE HANDSHAKE, THE WAY HE EMBRACED HIM, SHOWED HIM THE WAY. THERE YOU SEE IT AGAIN. Laura: HILARIOUS. THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THE LUNCHEON. I AM DELIGHTED TO SEE CNN, EVEN WITH BOURDAIN'S PASSING, THEY HAVE A CULINARY SENSIBILITY. JUST LOOK. BY RELEASING THE DETAILS OF THE MENU, THIS IS LEGITIMIZING KIM JONG UN. THE POOR NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE. IF THEY KNEW WHAT'S BEING DISHED OUT. THEY CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE THE TYPES OF FOODS. IT'S A POOR COUNTRY. BECAUSE OF KIM JONG UN HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY. BEEF SHORT RIBS, SWEET AND SOUR CRISPY PORK, FRIED RICE, SOY-BRAISED CODFISH. THAT SOUNDS REALLY YUMMY AND VERY EXPENSIVE. Laura: WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO SERVE? RAMEN NOODLES OR FROZEN TV DINNERS? Laura: I TOLD THEM TO BRING IN-N-OUT BURGERS. I'M SORRY BUT THAT WOULD BE REALLY TASTY. HOW DID IT TURN INTO A "PARTS UNKNOWN" SEGMENT? Laura: I LIKE HOW DON DON LEMMON TAKES HIS GLASSES OFF. QUAIL EGGS ON THE MENU. WE LOVE THE BODY LANGUAGE. CNN HAS THEIR OWN BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT THE PERSON WAS LEFT THE PICTURE, KIM JONG UN IN THAT MOMENT, HAS THE POSITION OF POWER. THE PERSON ON THE LEFT, LEFT A PICTURE WILL ALWAYS BE SEEN AS THE PERSON IN THE POWER POSITION. FOR TRUMP, AS THEIR SHAKING HANDS, TAKES 13 SECONDS. HE WILL DO AN UPPER ARM GRAB ON KIM JONG UN. I WANT TO POINT OUT I AM ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN AND I AM MORE DOMINANT AND I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE ARM. WHAT DOES BEING ON THE LEFT OR RIGHT HAVE TO DO WITH DOMINANCE? IT'S RIDICULOUS. I GET THAT GRABBING A NEW CONTROL BY GRABBING SOMEBODY'S ARM.
