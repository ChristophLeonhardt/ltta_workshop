THOUSAND STRONG INCHES CLOSES TO
THE UNITED STATES.
WHAT IS BEING DONE TO STOP THAT.
STEVE: WE HAVE A GRIFF JENKINS,
AS THE SUN SUN COMES UP WITH VAN
FILLED WITH PEOPLE ABOUT TO BE
PROCESSED IN MCALLEN, TEXAS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHAT WE'RE
WATCHING WITH GRIFF'S LIVE
CAMERA AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER
WITH MEN AND WOMEN BEING
ARRESTED?
>> PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR
LIVES.
THAT'S WHY.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
AND I'M NOT SAYING CONDONING
THEIR BEHAVIOR, BUT WE HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A
RECURRING PROBLEM.
I BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP, WHO
IS THE ULTIMATE DEAL-MAKER,
SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME THING
HE DID WITH KIM JONG-UN AND CALL
FOR AN EMERGENCY SUMMIT MEETING
IN THE CAPITAL OF HONDURAS,
ADVISE THE PRESIDENT OF
HONDURAS, EL SALVADOR AND
GUATEMALA, IN WHICH WAY THIS
COUNTRY CAN HELP THEM.
THIS HAPPENED BEFORE WITH
RONALD REAGAN.
I WAS THERE.
I WAS UNIVISION CENTRAL AMERICAN
BUREAU CHIEF AND I SAW HOW THE
UNITED STATES SHOWED LEADERSHIP,
AND HELPED OUR BACKYARD TO HAVE
PROSPERITY AND BE ABLE TO KEEP
THEIR BOYS HOME.
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HONDURAS
IS ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT
COUNTRY IN THE HEMISPHERE.
YOU WOULD DO IT TOO, IF YOUR
DAUGHTER IS FACING TO BE RAPED
OR YOUR SON TO BE PART OF A, I'M
NOT CONDONING, I UNDERSTAND THAT
WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR BORDER.
I AM A REPUBLICAN AND I BELIEVE
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A VERY
STRICT BORDER SECURITY BUT YOU
ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR
NEIGHBORS ARE DESPERATE.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
WE HELP THEM STAY HOME.
AINSLEY: WELL, MARIA, WE ARE
GIVING THEM A LOT OF MONEY.
WE'VE BEEN RUNNING NUMBERS ALL
THIS WEEK, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
TO EACH OF THESE CENTRAL
AMERICAN COUNTRIES.
HOW ARE THEY USING THAT MONEY?
WHY ISN'T THE COUNTRY, WHY DO WE
CONTINUOUSLY SEEING PEOPLE
FLEEING AND LEAVING, TALK BE
ABOUT RAPE IN THESE COUNTRIES?
WHAT IS OUR MONEY BEING USED
FOR.
>> THE MONEY IS 2 OR
$300 MILLION EARMARKED FOR EACH
COUNTRY.
REALITY WE COULD EARMARK THE
FUNDS FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.
I GO BACK TO MY IDEA.
PRESIDENT TRUMP NEEDS TO SHOW UP
THERE, JUST LIKE HE DID IN
NORTH KOREA, SAY, HERE WE ARE,
WE WANT TO HELP YOU.
ONCE AGAIN WE WANT TO HELP YOU
KEEP YOUR PEOPLE HOME.
LET'S DO SECURITY WITH POLICE.
DO EDUCATION PROGRAMS.
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
WE DONE IT BEFORE.
IT IS TIME FOR THE UNITED STATES
TO WAKE UP AND THEN WE'LL STOP
WHAT IS HAPPENING AT THE BORDER
RIGHT NOW AS IT HAPPENED YEARS
AGO WITH REAGAN I JUST SAID.
ED: MARIA, WE WANT TO BRING IN
OUR CORRESPONDENT GREFF JENKINS
WHO HAS BEEN ON THE STORY ALL
MORNING, LONG BEFORE THIS
PROGRAM AS WELL, BECAUSE HE HAS
BEEN ON THE BORDER BEFORE, WHEN
YOU HEAR THE TALK, MAYBE THERE
SHOULD A SUMMIT, MAYBE A
EMERGENCY NEEDS TO BE DEALT
WITH, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS
GO BACK AND FORTH, WHAT ABOUT
THE BORDER PATROL AGENTS BEHIND
YOU, THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO DO
THEIR JOB AS THIS POLITICAL
FIGHT PLAYS OUT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.
REPORTER: THAT IS A GREAT POINT,
ED.
BORDER PATROL WOULD BE FIRST TO
TELL YOU THEY DON'T MAKE THE
LAWS.
THEY ENFORCE THE LAWS AND DO A
DARN GOOD JOB OF DOING IT.
IF YOU ALSO TALK TO LEADERS HERE
WITH THE BORDER PATROL THEY WILL
TELL YOU IT IS LOOPHOLES IN
THESE LAWS THAT DRIVE PEOPLE
ACROSS THE BORDER.
LET ME GIVE YOU JUST A LITTLE
CONTEXT FOR JUST THIS TINY
LITTLE AREA THAT YOU'VE BEEN
SEEING THIS ACTIVITY, RIGHT?
IT IS 300% INCREASE FOR THIS
EXACT TIME LAST YEAR, IN TERMS
OF NUMBERS OF FAMILY UNITS THAT
ARE COMING HERE.
MORE THAN 5000 PEOPLE IN THE
LAST TWO WEEKS.
UPWARDS OF 600-POUNDS MARIJUANA
COMING.
THAT IS NOT INCLUDING THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE THESE MIDDLE-AGED TO
YOUNG MEN THAT WE'VE SEEN
RUNNING ALL OVER THE BORDER
TODAY.
SO IT IS THE DRIVER OF LOOPHOLES
IN THE LAWS THAT IS CAUSING THIS
TO HAPPEN.
IF THEY DO HAVE A SUMMIT AND THE
BORDER PATROL WOULD BE GLAD TO
ENFORCE WHATEVER LAWS OUR
POLITICIANS MAKE, THEY CAN'T TO
SEE CONSISTENCY SO THERE ISN'T
INCENTIVE ON THE PART OF THE
CARTELS WHO ARE RUTHLESS AND
VERY MUCH WATCHING WHAT WE'RE
DOING IN THIS COUNTRY.
STEVE: GO AHEAD, MARIA.
THE BORDER PATROLS ARE THE
HEROES.
I.C.E. IS THE HEROES.
THEY'RE JUST FOLLOWING RULES
FROM WASHINGTON.
THAT IS WHY WASHINGTON NEEDS TO
STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND SHOW
LEADERSHIP.
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING, I'M
SURE THAT "EL CHAPO" IS SENDING
A LOT OF DRUGS.
I'M SURE COYOTES ARE SMUGGLING A
LOT OF PEOPLE BUT OVERWHELMING
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE ARE
FACING DEATH.
THEY'RE UNDER THE THREAT OF
DEATH.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
HEY, BECAUSE WE ARE THE BEST
COUNTRY IN THE HEMISPHERE.
THEY KNOW IT.
THEY KNOW AMERICANS WILL TREAT
THEM A LOT BETTER THAN HONDURAN
OFFICIALS.
ED: YOU'RE RUNNING IN OPEN SEAT.
I WILL YAWN ROS-LEHTINEN,
RETIRING.
DONNA SHALALA FROM CLINTON
CABINET.
A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ASSUMED
WRONGLY SHE WOULD BE A SHOO-IN
THIS SEAT.
IT IS NOW BASICALLY A TOSS-UP
DOWN THERE IN SOUTH FLORIDA.
HOW BIG OF ISSUE IS ILLEGAL
IMMIGRATION IN THIS RACE?
>> IT IS, BUT WE UNDERSTAND IT
VERY WELL.
WE'RE THE ULTIMATE MELTING POT.
I CAN ADVISE NOT ONLY THE
PRESIDENT BUT WHOLE LEADERSHIP
IN CONGRESS.
WE GET IT.
I LIVE AMONG THEM.
I HAVE LIVED WITH THEM.
WE KNOW IT IS EASY.
HONDURANS AND CENTRAL AMERICANS
LOVE THE UNITED STATES.
WE ARE THE BEACON OF HOPE.
THAT IS WHY EVERYBODY WANTS TO
COME HERE.
BUT WE ALSO GET, NOT EVERYBODY
CAN COME INTO THE UNITED STATES.
SO LET'S HELP THEM.
SO THE SEAT, YOU JUST MENTIONED
DONNA SHALALA.
SHE JUST MADE A VERY BIG MISTAKE
A COUPLE DAYS AGO BY INVITING
ONE OF, A CONGRESSWOMAN FROM
CALIFORNIA, HER NAME IS BARBARA
ALI.
BARBARA ALI IS ONE OF MOST
IMPORTANT APOLOGISTS AND
DEFENDERS OF FIDEL CASTRO.
HOW CAN YOU BE INVITING SOMEBODY
THAT HAS SHOWN SUCH PREFERENCE
FOR FIDEL TO THE HEART OF THE
CUBAN EXILE?
IT SHOWS MY OPPONENT IS
COMPLETELY CLUELESS AND
DISCONNECTED FROM OUR COMMUNITY,
A COMMUNITY THAT SHE WILL WANT
TO REPRESENT IN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES, AND IN THE U.S.
CONGRESS.
SO I, I THINK THAT RIGHT THERE
IT IS, IT IS VERY, IT IS VERY
CLEAR WHO IS REALLY THE IDEAL
REPRESENTATIVE.
ED: GRIFF HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE
NEWS.
GRIFF, WE HAVE 30 SECONDS.
WHAT IS HAPPENING BEHIND YOU?
REPORTER: JUST VERY QUICKLY, I
WILL TAKE A MOMENT TO ASK THESE
GENTLEMAN, CAN YOU ASK THEM WHY
THEY CAME HERE?
>> FOR NECESSITY.
REPORTER: IF ANY OF THEM COME TO
DO HARP TO THE UNITED STATES?
>>
>> JUST COMING FOR WORK.
REPORTER: COMING HERE FOR WORK,
FOUR MEN IN THEIR 20s.
THEY WILL DO DEBRIEFING,
PROCESSING THEM.
WE'LL FIND OUT ABOUT THEM
PERHAPS LATER.
THEY ALL SAY THEY'RE COMING FOR
WORK.
ED: THANKS FOR YOUR REPORTING.
>> THAT IS NOT RIGHT
TRANSLATION.
THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU SAID.
ED: WHAT DID HE SAY?
>> HE TRANSLATED, HE SAID ARE
YOU COMING HERE FOR WHAT REASON?
HE DIDN'T ASK ARE YOU COMING
HERE TO HARM THE UNITED STATES.
THEN THEY REPEATED ONCE AGAIN,
OUT OF NEED.
NEED FOR WORK.
