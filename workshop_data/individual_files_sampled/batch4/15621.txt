special counsel Robert Muller is hiring more attorneys but not for the reason you might think now this from a Bloomberg story let me read it to you it's a special counsel Robert Muller is tapping additional Justice Department resources for help with new legal battles as his year old investigation of Russian interference with the 2016 election continues to expand well that right there is problematic that lead because his investigation is not about Russian interference in the election that's the job of FBI counter-intel Robert Muller was tasked with investigating collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign he hasn't found any we just can't change his investigative mandate on the fly and now claim it's for a Russian interference that enables Muller to operate as a shadow FBI and DOJ very very problematic very problematic now it says Muller and his team of 17 federal prosecutors are coping with a higher than expected volume of court challenges that has added complexity in recent months but there's no political appetite at this time to increase the size of his staff officials say well he's either doing it or he's not so is he tapping them or is there no political appetite to do it and he's not gonna do it according to his most recent statement of expenditure more money is being spent on work done by permanent Department of Justice units and on Muller's own dedicated operation the DOJ units spent nine million dollars from the investigation start in May 2017 through March of this year compared with 7.7 million dollars for Muller's team in during the same time period let's go back he's hiring these people to cope with a higher than expected volume of legal challenges because Muller's playing games of course general Flynn's team and others are now gonna start questioning and filing motions after 50,000 text messages between Peter strike and Lisa page were revealed of course they are who wouldn't that's all at scopa Tory evidence that was arguably with held Muller's the attorneys the defense attorneys have to do that now in his investigators in New York Alexandria Virginia Pittsburgh and elsewhere have been tapped to supplement the work of mothers team Muller has already handed off one major investigation the Michael Cohen case transpersonal we're here the Southern District of New York but why why was Muller even looking at Michael Cohen what the stormy Daniels a porn star have to do with Russian collusion nothing that's why when the president calls this a witch hunt hoax president right the president is right now you're heard trey gowdy at a hearing last week tell Muller quote whenever you got finish it the hell up because this country is being torn apart he why didn't all the mullet oh let's rob Rosen's died for the DOJ now Muller has his supporters he has his supporters and one says I don't think he's getting in over his head got him Salomon Weissenberg he was deputy independent counsel investigating Bill Clinton he said these things have a tendency to balloon yes it may be taxing on them the investigators but it's not unusual now you know Muller is is gonna I predict have his hands full we did it on a boot it's Tuesday general Flynn's going back in a court the judge called everybody in so we're gonna see what's going on there the judge is probably gonna want to know why they keep delaying his sentencing but maybe just maybe there's some new evidence now Mullard hasn't indicted anybody for collusion he hasn't charged anybody for collusion because there was no collusion even if there was not illegal but there was no criminal collusion he charged people with making false statements or basically saying I don't remember or or recollecting an event differently than his investigators deemed it should have been recollected I mean those charges are ridiculous and then he indicted 13 Russian some things we don't have know if they're real people and Russia said even if they are they're never gonna go to court but too bad too bad Muller but now adding more lawyers the deal with with growing legal challenges is is fundamentally wrong it's wasting taxpayer money so that Muller can cover his own mistakes there's something very very wrong about this and it needs to be shut down I say it almost every day I'm not a fan of special counsels but now we need a second special counsel to investigate many many things within the DOJ and FBI the Hillary investigation how that all went down but we might need the second special counsel counsel to also investigate the first special counsel this is really important and I want to stay up to date on this story because it just makes me very uncomfortable I'm gonna be doing that every day here and I'm gonna be doing it in depth on my live show he
