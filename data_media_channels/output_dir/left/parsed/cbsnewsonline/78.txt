CAPITOL HILL WERE SENATOR 
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS SPEAKING 
ABOUT HIS LONGTIME FRIEND THE 
LATE SENATOR JOHN McCAIN. 
>>DEVOTED WIFE, YOU DID WELL BY 
JOHN. 
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, I WILL 
TRY TO MAKE THIS SOMEWHAT FUN, 
EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT FEEL IN A 
FUNNY MOOD. 
BOTTOM LINE IS LET'S START OFF 
WITH --. 
FOR ANYBODY WHO MAY BE WATCHING 
ON TELEVISION, THIS IS A NAVAL 
ACADEMY TYPE. 
I WORE THIS TODAY, JOHN, TO 
HONOR YOU AND TO ANNOY YOU AT 
THE SAME TIME. 
HE WOULD CONSTANTLY TELL ME, 
LINDSAY, I WISH YOU WERE IN MY 
NAVAL ACADEMY CLASS. 
I SAID THAT IS VERY NICE, JOHN. 
DO YOU KNOW WHY, LINDSAY? 
I SAID NO, JOHN. 
HE SAID IF YOU HAD BEEN IN MY 
CLASS I WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX 
FROM THE BOTTOM NOT SIX. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JOHN. 
HUMILIATION WAS HIS CONSTANT 
COMPANION. 
THE MORE HUMILIATED YOU THE 
MORE HE LIKED TO. 
IN THAT REGARD I WAS WELL 
SERVED. 
TO MY COLLEAGUES, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE. 
THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO PUT THIS 
IN WORDS THAT MAY BE JOHN CAN 
RELATE TO IS AFTER A MILITARY 
OPERATION IS OVER AFTER THE 
MISSION IS COMPLETE THE PILOT 
COME BACK AND DEBRIEF. 
IF THERE IS A MILITARY 
OPERATION THERE IS AN AFTER 
ACTION REPORT. 
I THOUGHT WHAT WOULD IT SAY? 
WHAT WOULD A AFTER ACTION 
REPORT SAY FOR JOHN McCAIN? 
THE REPORT WOULD SAY LESSONS 
LEARNED SO THAT OTHERS WOULD 
BENEFIT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE 
REMEMBER. 
REMEMBER THE THINGS THAT WENT 
WELL AND THE THINGS THAT DID NOT
SO WE WILL BE BETTER OFF AS A 
UNIT AND AS A NATION. 
THE TITLE OF THE OPERATION WAS 
EASY, YOU CAN SAY A LOT OF 
THINGS ABOUT ME BUT CLEVER IS 
NOT ONE OF THEM. 
OPERATION MAVERICK. 
IT BEGAN IN THE FALL IN 1954, 
THE YEAR BEFORE I WAS BORN, AT 
THE NAVAL ACADEMY, AND IT ENDED 
25 AUGUST 2018. 
WHAT CAN WE LEARN? 
THE SOURCE OF THE REPORT IS ME. 
HIS POLITICAL WINGMAN, CODENAME,
LITTLE JERK. 
YOU ALL HAVE YOUR NAMES AND YOU 
EARN THEM LIKE I DID. 
WHO WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO WALK IN 
HIS SHADOW AND WITNESS HISTORY 
OF CLOSE. 
TO BE IN THE PRESENCE OF A GIANT
AT THE TIME EVERYTHING AROUND 
US WAS SO SMALL. 
WHAT DID I LEARN? 
A FEW DUMB JOKES TOLD OVER AND 
OVER ACTUALLY BECOME FUNNY. 
AND THEY CAN TAKE YOU A LONG 
WAY IN POLITICS, MARCO. 
I WILL GIVE THEM TO YOU BECAUSE 
JOHN MIGHT DO. 
LINDSAY, HOW HOT IS IT IN 
ARIZONA? 
JOHN, I DON'T KNOW. 
IT IS SO HOT THAT THE TREES 
CHASE THE DOGS. WHAT IS UNIQUE 
ABOUT ARIZONA? 
I DON'T KNOW, JOHN. 
BARRY GOLDWATER RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT A LOT, -- RAN FOR 
PRESIDENT AND LOSS. 
I RAN FOR PRESIDENT AND LOSS. 
IT IS THE ONLY PLACE IN THE 
NATION WHERE MOTHERS TELL THEIR 
CHILDREN YOU CAN NEVER GROW UP 
TO BE PRESIDENT. 
JEFF, REMEMBER THAT. 
MAYBE YOU CAN BREAK THE STRING. 
LINDSAY, AREN'T YOU A LAWYER? 
I AM, JOHN. 
HE SAID YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN A LAWYER AND A CATFISH? 
NOW I DON'T. 
ONE IS A BOTTOM DWELLING SCUM 
SUCKING CREATURE AND THE OTHER 
IS A FISH. 
NO WONDER WE DID SO POORLY WITH 
LAWYERS, JOHN. 
DO YOU KNOW WHY I JOINED THE 
MARINES? 
I SAID NO. 
MY PARENTS WERE MARRIED. 
I'M GOING TO MISS THESE DUMB 
JOKES. 
WHAT ELSE DID I LEARN? 
I LEARNED HOW TO FIGHT, A LOT. 
EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY. 
I LEARNED HOW TO FORGIVE. AND 
FROM HIM I SAW HOW TO HEAL. 
ON THE -- SIDE I LEARNED THAT 
THE CAPTURED WARRIOR WHO WAS 
TORTURED BECAME THE STATESMAN 
WHO FOR GAVE AND HEALED THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HIS FORMER 
ADVERSARY AND OUR NATION. 
I WENT TO THE HANOI HILTON, ONE 
OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF MY LIFE, 
WITH JOHN, IT IS NOW A MUSEUM. 
WE ARE THE BAD GUYS BECAUSE 
THEY GET THEIR RIGHT ON HOW THE 
MUSEUM READS. 
I REMEMBER BEING IN FRONT OF 
HIS CELL AND YOU COULD SEE THE 
WHEELS TURNING AND THE MEMORIES 
COMING BACK. 
AS WE WALKED FORWARD, 
SURROUNDED BY A BUNCH OF 
HANDLERS, JOHN McCAIN WAS ELVIS 
IN VIETNAM, IT WAS THE MOST 
AMAZING THING IN THE WORLD HOW 
PEOPLE ADORED HIM IN VIETNAM. 
I SAW PHOTOS ON THE WALL OF 
PRISONERS PLAYING VOLLEYBALL, 
SITTING IN THE SUN WITH 
SUNGLASSES. 
I SAID JOHN, IT MUST NOT HAVE 
BEEN THAT BAD AFTER ALL. 
HE SAID, I DON'T REMEMBER IT 
THIS WAY. 
WHICH ALLOWED US TO GET OUT OF 
VIETNAM. 
I REMEMBER HIM EMBRACING A WAR 
THAT NOBODY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
BECAUSE HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT 
WOULD COST TO LOSE IT. 
I REMEMBER HIM SUPPORTING THE 
SURGE WHEN EVERYBODY WAS 
WILLING TO GET OUT OF IRAQ 
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO TIRED OF IT
AND SAW NO WAY FORWARD. 
I REMEMBER THE FIGHTER. 
I REMEMBER THE 2008 CAMPAIGN, 
IN 2007 JOHN McCAIN WAS FIFTH 
IN A FOUR-PERSON RACE. 
WRITTEN OFF AS POLITICALLY 
DEAD, NO MONEY, STRAIGHT TALK 
EXPRESS HAD NO WHEELS. 
OUT OF SHEER DETERMINATION 
AFTER A VISIT TO IRAQ WERE 
GENERAL PETRAEUS ALLOWED HIM TO 
TALK IN JULY TO 600 PEOPLE WHO 
WERE GOING TO REENLIST IN A WAR 
THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO 
CONTINUE TO FIGHT AND ABOUT 
EQUAL NUMBER WERE BECOMING 
CITIZENS BECAUSE THEY WERE 
FIGHTING FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND 
THEY HAD EXPEDITED CITIZENSHIP. 
TWO EMPTY CHAIRS IN THE FRONT 
WITH BOOTS AND JOHN ASKED WHAT 
IS THAT ABOUT? 
TWO DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE 
CEREMONY BUT THEY WERE GIVEN 
THEIR CITIZENSHIP THAT DAY. 
I REMEMBER ABOUT 2000 CHOUTEAU 
-- SOLDIERS WANTED A PHOTO AND 
EVERYONE GOT IT. 
I REMEMBER IT BEING SO HOT THAT 
I COULD NOT BREATHE BUT WE 
STAYED. 
I REMEMBER COMING BACK AND 
GETTING THE NOMINATION ONLY TO 
LOSE. 
I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT VERY WELL.
HE WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT, HE 
WAS PREPARED TO BE PRESIDENT, 
BUT IT WAS NOT HIS TO HAVE. 
I REMEMBER THE SPEECH HE GAVE 
THAT NIGHT. 
JOHN TAUGHT US HOW TO LOSE. 
WHEN YOU GO THROUGHOUT THE 
WORLD, PEOPLE REMEMBER HIS 
CONCESSION SPEECH AS MUCH AS 
ANYTHING ELSE. 
THERE ARE SO MANY COUNTRIES 
WHERE YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE 
BECAUSE THEY KILL YOU. 
JOHN SAID THAT NIGHT, PRESIDENT 
OBAMA IS NOW MY PRESIDENT. 
HE HEALED A NATION AT A TIME 
THAT HE WAS HURT. 
I REMEMBER LEARNING A CAUSE 
GREATER THAN YOURSELF HURTS. 
HE COULD NOT PUT HIS JACKET ON, 
HE COULD NOT COMB HIS HAIR 
BECAUSE HE GOT HURT SERVING A 
CAUSE GREATER THEN HIMSELF. 
I REMEMBER HOW EASY IT IS TO 
SAY AND HOW HARD IT IS TO DO. 
HOW HARD IT IS TO TELL TO FACE 
I THINK YOU ARE WRONG. 
HOW HARD IT IS TO SOLVE 
PROBLEMS THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTS 
TO TALK ABOUT. 
I LEARNED THAT FAILURE AND 
SUCCESS ARE THE DIFFERENT SIDES 
OF THE SAME COIN. 
JOHN TOLD ME I HAVE BECOME 
BETTER FROM FAILURES BECAUSE IT 
TEACHES US. WITHOUT MY FAILURES 
I WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL. 
FOR THOSE AS A YOUNG PERSON 
REMEMBER JOHN McCAIN HE FAILED 
A LOT BUT HE NEVER QUIT. 
THE REASON WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
HIM TODAY AND THE REASON I AM 
CRYING IS BECAUSE HE WAS 
SUCCESSFUL DESPITE HIS 
FAILURES. 
FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS, THE 
AFTER ACTION REPORT WOULD SAY A 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MAVERICK 
BROUGHT JOY AND DIFFICULTY. 
BOTH WERE A CONSTANT COMPANION. 
HE WAS A DIFFICULT MAN. 
HE COULD BE TOUGH. THE JOY THAT 
YOU RECEIVED FROM BEING WITH HIM
WILL SUSTAIN YOU FOR A LIFETIME.
I AM SO LUCKY TO HAVE BEEN IN 
HIS PRESENCE. 
HE TAUGHT ME THAT PRINCIPAL AND 
COMPROMISE ARE NOT MUTUALLY 
EXCLUSIVE. 
THE FOUNDATION OF A GREAT 
PERSON AS WELL IS A GREAT 
NATION. 
HE TAUGHT ME THAT IMMIGRATION, 
AS HARD AS IT IS TO SOLVE, 
SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO DO IT. 
HE SAID TO ME, WITH TED 
KENNEDY, YOU ARE GOING TO LEARN 
THAT THE OTHER SIDE HAS TO GET 
SOMETHING TO. 
I HAVE LEARNED THAT LESSON. 
TO MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE,
AS LONG AS I AM HERE I WILL 
REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE TO GET 
SOMETHING TO. 
HE TOLD ME WHEN GOOD IGNORES 
EVIL IT MAY BE CONVENIENT, BUT 
IT SELDOM WORKS. 
HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN IN IRAQ IF WE LEFT, HE 
WAS RIGHT. 
HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN IN SYRIA IF WE DID NOT 
GET INVOLVED, HE WAS RIGHT. 
WHY? 
BECAUSE WARRIORS ARE THE BEST 
AT MAKING PEACE AND THE WARRIOR 
UNDERSTANDS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN A FALSE PEACE AND REAL 
PEACE. 
TO THOSE WHO ACCUSED HIM OF -- 
ENDLESS WARS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA 
WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. 
HE WANTED SUSTAINABLE PEACE AND 
HE UNDERSTOOD THE CONSEQUENCES 
OF NOT SEEING IT THROUGH. 
THE SOLDIERS ADORED HIM. 
TO THOSE WHO HAVE TRAVELED WITH 
JOHN, YOU SELDOM HAD TWO MEALS 
IN THE SAME COUNTRY. 
YOU MET MORE PEOPLE THAN YOU 
COULD REMEMBER BUT YOU WERE 
STRUCK BY ONE THING, WE WERE 
GOING TO BAD PLACES AND THOSE 
IN THE MILITARY ADORED THIS MAN.
HE TAUGHT ME THAT BOLDNESS AND 
PRACTICALITY MUST BE PRACTICED 
IN EQUAL MEASURE. 
HE BELIEVES IN CLIMATE CHANGE, 
AND SODA WHY. 
THERE IS A PRACTICAL STREAK 
ABOUT JOHN THAT I THINK MADE 
HIM VERY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE HE 
TOLD ME TIME AND TIME AGAIN, 
YOU HAVE TO LET PEOPLE CATCH UP 
WITH YOU. 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A RHYTHM AND A 
PACE. 
THERE ARE 100 PEOPLE IN THIS 
BODY FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF 
LIFE. 
YOU MAY THINK YOU ARE RIGHT AND 
OVER TIME IF YOU ARE IT WILL BE 
PROVEN. 
BUT GIVE YOUR COLLEAGUES THE 
TIME AND UNDERSTANDING TO CATCH 
UP WITH YOU. 
HE TAUGHT ME THAT HONOR AND 
IMPERFECTION ARE ALWAYS IN 
COMPETITION. 
I DO NOT CRY FOR A PERFECT MAN. 
I CRY FOR MAN WHO HAD ON AND 
WAS WILLING TO ADMIT HIS 
IMPERFECTION. 
IF YOU'RE THINKING OF GETTING 
INTO POLITICS. 
THE ONE THING I WOULD ASK YOU 
TO LOOK AT WHEN IT COMES TO THE 
LIFE OF JOHN McCAIN, IT IS OKAY 
TO TELL PEOPLE, I SCREWED UP. 
I GOT THIS WRONG. 
I WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. 
HONOR IS, IN MY VIEW, DOING THE 
RIGHT THING AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE.
HE DID THAT TIME AND TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN. 
HE TAUGHT ME THAT LIFE WITHOUT 
PASSION AND LOVE IS A SAD LIFE. 
HE HAD A HAPPY LIFE. 
HE HAD 10 LIVES. HE WAS 
INVOLVED IN FIVE AVIATION 
ACCIDENTS. 
IF WE SENT HIM A BILL FOR ALL 
THE PLANES HE CRASHED HE COULD 
NEVER PAY IT OFF. 
HE LIVED LIFE TO ITS FULLEST. 
HE WAS OFTEN DISAPPOINTED, BUT 
HE WAS NEVER DETOURED FROM 
GETTING BACK UP AND GOING AT IT 
AGAIN. LOVE, NOT A WORD OFTEN 
ASSOCIATED WITH SENATOR McCAIN. 
IT SHOULD BE. 
IF YOU ARE LOVED BY HIM YOU 
KNEW IT. 
YOU WERE LOVED WITH ALL OF YOUR 
FAULTS AND I WAS LUCKY TO HAVE 
BEEN LOVED BY HIM. 
HOW WOULD I CHARACTERIZE 
OPERATION MAVERICK? 
WILDLY SUCCESSFUL. 
IT MADE THE WORLD A BETTER 
PLACE. 
IT GAVE THE NATION SOMETHING TO 
TALK ABOUT AT A TIME WHEN WE 
CAN'T AGREE ON ANYTHING. 
NOT UNIVERSAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE 
LIFE OF JOHN McCAIN BUT PRETTY 
CLOSE. 
THE ONLY TIME MSNBC, CNN AND 
FOX ARE SAYING THE SAME THING. 
THE ONLY WAY THAT HAPPENED IS 
BECAUSE THOSE OF US WHO HAD THE 
PLEASURE OF BEING IN HIS 
PRESENCE, AND THOSE WHO COVERED 
HIM IN YOUR BUSINESS WANT TO 
TELL THE STORY. I 
HAVEN'T BEEN APPROACHED SINCE 
-- I HAVE BEEN APPROACHED SINCE 
HIS DEATH BY CABDRIVERS, 
WAITERS, COPS AND THEY SAY 
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. 
MY NAME IS GRAHAM, NOT McCAIN. 
BUT I FEEL LIKE A McCAIN. 
I DO NOT KNOW IF I HAVE EARNED 
THAT HONOR BUT I FEEL LIKE IT. 
THE AVERAGE MAN AND WOMAN IN 
THIS COUNTRY GOT JOHN McCAIN. 
WHAT WILL IT MEAN FOR THE 
FUTURE? 
IT MEANS THERE WILL BE 
GENERATIONS OF POLITICIANS 
COMING ALONG WHO WILL BE 
INFLUENCED BY HIM. 
THE McCAIN INSTITUTE IS ALIVE 
AND WELL. 
IT'S GOAL IS TO GET YOUNG 
LEADERS THROUGHOUT THE 
DEVELOPING WORLD, EXPOSE THEM 
TO DEMOCRACY, TEACH THEM THE 
ART OF COMPROMISE, THE RULE OF 
LAW, AND WHAT A LEGACY. 
JOHN WILL INSPIRE COURAGE HE 
WILL REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT 
NOTHING IS INEVITABLE AS LONG 
AS A FEW PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO 
FIGHT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS 
RIGHT. 
IT IS GOING TO BE A LONELY 
JOURNEY FOR A WHILE. 
I WILL NEED YOUR HELP. 
AND THE VOID TO BE FILLED BY 
JOHN'S PASSING IS MORE THAN I 
CAN DO. 
DON'T LOOK TO BE TO REPLACE 
THIS MAN. 
LOOK TO ME TO REMEMBER WHAT HE 
WAS ABOUT AND TRY TO FOLLOW IN 
HIS FOOTSTEPS. 
IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME, JOIN 
THE MARCH. 
IF YOU WANT TO HELP THE COUNTRY,
BE LIKE JOHN McCAIN. 
I BELIEVE THERE IS JOHN McCAIN 
AND ALL OF ITS. 
I BELIEVE A LITTLE JOHN McCAIN 
PRACTICED BY ALL PEOPLE COULD 
MAKE THIS A GREAT NATION. 
MY FRIEND, PRETTY GOOD. 
YOU LIVED IN THE SHADOW OF A 
FOUR-STAR FATHER AND A FOUR-
STAR GRANDFATHER. YOU WORRIED 
THAT YOU WOULD DISAPPOINT, YOU 
DID NOT. 
TO CINDY AND THE CHILDREN, 
THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME A PART 
OF THE PLAN. 
TO T McCABE YOU TAUGHT ME WHAT 
LOYALTY WAS ABOUT. 
TO MY COLLEAGUES. 
THANK YOU.
