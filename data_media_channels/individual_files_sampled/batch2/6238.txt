he's also giving himself a lot of credit in his own particular way and here is how he is describing the reaction to the meeting and a little video clip we brought him together in this room and it was a tremendous meeting actually it was reported as incredibly good in my performance of you know some of them called it a performance I consider it work but got great reviews by everybody other than two networks who were phenomenal for about two hours then after that they were called by their voices oh wait a minute I have two things about that one is his choice of words you didn't see it in that clip but right before that the things he just said there he said welcome back to the studio okay yeah he did and so he called it a studio then he said that he got great reviews about his performance oh there's called the performance I mean I mean for me it's work in front of the camera just sit there and not say something batshit crazy not start war with North Korea while demonstrating no knowledge of the topic we're talking about I call that work so he just views it as as a show he does I mean and this is a this is in Michael Wolf's book it's in almost every report he views every day and this is from again White House insiders every day it like a TV show that you have to win that day and so but except it's not a TV show the there's eight hundred thousand dreamers and their lives depend on it you might be sending back them back to countries they've never lived in they some of them don't know the language they would literally not have any idea where to go could be incredibly dangerous situations there yeah you would be ruining their lives and then let alone their loved ones that are here but to him that never crossed senators Dennis of course his mind at all he just thinks like did we win how's my ratings did I get good reviews how was my performance yeah it's just he's not a serious man no and that's super obvious but it's disturbing in that thing in all he wants us all he wants this credit and you know what Democrats just wisen up man just like there is a wait is like I don't want you to stroke his ego because it's just degrading and humiliating but there's a way to like if all that MSNBC or CNN has to do is go good job Donald Trump with those dreamers that was amazing that was one of the best things you've ever done anybody okay that's it dreamers are in yeah in fact they all get citizenship a million dollars plus a hundred bucks each you get a car you can the car dreamers you know what I'll treat him get the banks I'll give him everything yeah there you go but yes he isn't quite getting that I mean look he's obviously happy with himself he thinks that he got good reviews he's up being nominated for an Oscar actually but it gets a little bit weirder so here is a little bit more description of the reaction to the meeting let's adjudicate if this actually happened or not and unfortunately a lot of those anchors sent us letters saying that was one of the greatest meetings they've ever witnessed and they were great for about two hours they were phenomenal and then they went a little bit south orders but not that day it was fun they probably wish they didn't send us those letters of congratulations but it was good sure their ratings were fantastic they always liked and stopped obsessing about the goddamn ratings all right but and guys come on e is there anybody in the country that doesn't realize the guy's a lunatic yet they said it was one of the greatest meetings they've ever seen it was a perfectly normal meeting about one piece of legislation where he slightly agreed with Democrats and people were like oh he's willing to sometimes agree with Democrats I guess they were he was corrected by the Republicans say anyway that's not actually our position yes the most information he gave was I will sign anything you give me I'm not gonna say what should be in it great meaning you're amazing maybe maybe they're doing what you said maybe a brian Stelter literally mailed him a letter saying that was a great job to get him to just back off and let this I thought was not what Stelter does or CNN no it didn't actually happen right but one of the greatest meetings they have ever seen if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network comm slash join and once you do you'll be saying get home like a smart person or you might say I think it's weird or you might say oops no that won't be that one it won't be that one it'll be great trust me TYT Network comm / joy
