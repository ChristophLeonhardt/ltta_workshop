1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,000
If you listen to mainstream music these days,
you know this rap flow.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,279
If you love it, you’re in luck - It’s
probably not going to go away anytime soon.

3
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,359
If you hate it, I’m sorry.

4
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,300
But, hey, you have something in common with
Snoop Dogg now.

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,238
Everybody tryin to rap the same style.

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,700
I don’t know who created it if it was Future
or Migos but all them ni**s sound the same.

7
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:50,010
That rapid fire style of rap has been dubbed
the “Migos Flow” even the “Versace Flow.”

8
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,239
It’s come to define mainstream artists in
recent years.

9
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,579
But the musical principle that drives that
flow — the triplet - It’s been around

10
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:00,500
forever.

11
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,900
In 2013 Migos, the Atlanta rap trio - released
a song called “Versace”

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,400
I’m just gonna pause that for a second.

13
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,800
Drake loved it so much, he freestyled over
it.

14
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,760
and it blew up.

15
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,100
You can’t deny “Versace.”

16
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:29,060
Like my grandma would walk around singing
Versace and she didn't even know the words

17
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:32,660
of the song or what it's about but the hook
is so catchy that's how big of a song it was.

18
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:36,500
That’s Justin Hunte you might know him as
the former editor in chief of Hip Hop DX.

19
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,119
He covers hip hop trends and news on his own
youtube channel.

20
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,899
you have like a lot of forces that just sort
of combine at the right time for that flow

21
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:48,860
to finally to make it to prominence even though
its origins have been around for a while.

22
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,220
Triplets are a standard in musical composition.

23
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:57,439
They occur when you divide one beat into three
notes instead of their usual two or four.

24
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,060
Recognize this?

25
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,920
That’s probably the most famous measure
with triplets.

26
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,630
But they go back even further.

27
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:09,750
These are types of rhythms that have been
at the foundation of cultures where hip hop

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,220
came from in the first place.

29
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,900
It's African rhythms and so that’s as old
as the equator.

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,750
In rap, triplets work the same way.

31
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,900
Just take a listen to Young Thug’s “Get
High” featuring Snoop Dogg.

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,400
Now, compare that to earlier in the song where
there are no triplets.

33
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,720
And you start to hear the difference.

34
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,650
It’s hard to say exactly when the first
triplet was rapped, but a lot of people point

35
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,700
to Public Enemy's “Bring the Noise” as
one of the earliest examples.

36
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:56,950
Another track with triplets from 1987?

37
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,700
The Dismasters’ “Small Time Hustler.”

38
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,069
Triplets existed during the east coast / west
coast era of hip hop, but they didn’t define

39
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,280
those artists.

40
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,319
They emerged out of the midwest and south
when those communities started developing

41
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,739
their own style.

42
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,270
Like that whole Ohio down to Tennessee corridor.

43
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,370
There was a lot of stylistic similarities
to a few of the different artists.

44
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,549
Listen to Krayzie Bone verse off of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony’s

45
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:25,049
debut album.

46
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,200
That flow stands in stark contrast to the
way Easy-E approached the same beat on that

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,800
song.

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,220
And then there’s Three 6 Mafia from Memphis.

49
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,830
I think it's very difficult to give anyone
else credit other than Lord Infamous.

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,920
Mystic Stylez is a joint that I remember really
early.

51
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,720
Tommy Wright III - he's another artist from
Memphis as well.

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,080
He had a song called “Gangsta Forever.”

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,180
All these artists released their debut albums
in the mid ‘90s.

54
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,630
And they weren’t just rapping fast, they
were manipulating the beat with triplets.

55
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,770
So how exactly did they pull it off?

56
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,640
You have to look at the structure of the beat.

57
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:34,160
For triplets to really eventually come and
be so famous they needed to steal the show

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,090
and to steal the show they needed space.

59
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,820
That’s Martin Connor.

60
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,610
You might remember him from these two videos.

61
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,890
So, you can create a hip hop beat in a couple
of different ways.

62
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,760
This is the beat, and I can interpret this
beat in a rap song in two different ways.

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,760
I can go.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,090
Boom, tuh, boom tuh, boom , tuh, boom, tuh.

65
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,890
Or I can go like this.

66
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:02,030
Boom, tuh, boom boom, tuh, but my snaps have
always come at the same speed, right?

67
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,030
But the snare drums?

68
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,740
They come half as often giving the rapper
more space to play.

69
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,470
“Notorious Thugs” illustrates this perfectly.

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,080
And it's also one of my favorite songs so
I want to talk about it.

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,840
This instrumental sounds like a slow downtempo
beat, that's because we're used to hearing

72
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,120
the snare on the two and

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,880
the four.

74
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,720
The acutal bpm though is double the speed.

75
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,600
Essentially the instrumental beat has two
rhythmic lanes for the artist to rap in.

76
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,320
Biggie, Bizzy Bone, Krayzie Bone, they all
keep you on your toes by constantly changing

77
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,280
those lanes.

78
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,340
Because the beat is stretched out and feels
slow, they can very naturally divide those

79
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,280
notes further into triplets.

80
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,400
Let’s switch back to Lord Infamous of Three
6 Mafia.

81
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,160
That slow beat allowed him to rap an entire
verse in triplets.

82
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,300
From the 90s till the mid 2000s southern hip
hop artists slowly took over the charts and

83
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,660
with that they brought the sound of trap.

84
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,530
That stretched out beat is the foundation
of that sound but you’ll also hear, a deep

85
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:46,240
808 kick drum, driving synths, and rapid fire hi-hats that
are often programmed in triplet patterns.

86
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,300
Triplets were always in rap.

87
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,440
Triplets were waiting for trap music to come
along, and then trap music came along and

88
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,090
it was just a marriage made in heaven.

89
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,930
A song like "Versace" made the sound and rhythmic
feel of triplets super catchy.

90
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:05,040
Just listen to how that hook plays back and
for those explosive hi-hats.

91
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,600
Five years later it’s pretty easy to see
why triplets are Migos’ bread and butter.

92
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,640
I don't think Migos trailing off or fall off.

93
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,860
I think they have legitimate star power and
most importantly I think they put together

94
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,460
an incredible album this year.

95
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,760
Not only that, they’ve been featured on
tracks by some of the biggest artists of today.

96
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,540
Triplets aren’t just popular, though.

97
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,350
They’re really complex.

98
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:56,960
The triplets sort of challenges the
rhythms and the counts that we're used to. They can rev up the energy of a song almost instantly.

99
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,400
Kendrick used them on Good Kid, M.A.A.D City
and then five years later on one of the most

100
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,740
dramatic moments of DAMN.

101
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,803
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA.

102
00:08:05,803 --> 00:08:13,000
This is why I say that hip-hop has done more
damage to young African Americans than racism

103
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,420
in recent years.

104
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,470
Chance the Rapper has a similar dramatic transition to
triplets on the opening track of Coloring

105
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
Book

106
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,880
When

107
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,760
he starts flowing in triplets there are no
base kicks there are no snares.

108
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,360
So what does Chance do, but he makes the triplet
the manifestation of the beat.

109
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,030
These are two of the biggest artists outside
of the south using triplets.

110
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,500
They're no longer a niche southern style.

111
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,350
They’ve been the dominating sound of hip
hop for over five years now.

112
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:04,840
Now, when a rapper uses that rhythm they’re
tapping into this great collective artistic

113
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,840
movement.

114
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,710
So Snoop’s not entirely wrong

115
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:15,370
That's what's wrong right now everybody try to rap the same. I don't know who created it if it was Future
or Migos but all them ni**s sound the same.

116
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:17,590
But he kinda misses the point.

117
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,990
The fact that triplets are super popular now
shouldn’t undermine the fact that they’re

118
00:09:21,990 --> 00:00:00,000
actually a really powerful rhythmic tool that’s
been around for a long time.
