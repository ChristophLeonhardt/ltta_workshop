I saw on slate.com today that Michelle wolf yeah I know one of our favorite comedians she is doing a patriotic red white and blue salute to abortion with the country more polarized than ever it's been hard for Americans to find common ground this fourth of July on Sunday Michelle wolf released a video that's jam-packed with exactly the kind of flag waving toe-tapping muscularly patriotic symbolism but it doesn't seem likely to heal the nation please enjoy the breaks 10th annual salute to abortion during the White House Correspondents Dinner she also made jokes about abortion Mike Pence is also very anti choice he thinks abortion is murder which first of all don't knock it till you try it and when you do try it really knock it you know you're gonna get that baby out of there and yeah sure you can groan all you won I know a lot of you are very anti-abortion you know unless it's the one you got for your secret mistress we saw with the Supreme Court justice thing that they were obsessed with their abortions Roe vs. Wade abortions abortions abortions I'm gonna get as many abortions as possible it is incredible how fixated these people aren't abortions and even saluted I mean okay let's not go there I know that there's extreme sides and people are very sensitive about this on both sides but let's just say someone that's not even political at all is not an extreme lefty and they had to make the decision that they had to get an abortion I mean that is a painful decision to make I'm sure and something that is probably really traumatizing so to salute it and act like it's so great and make these flip and jokes about it it's probably really insulting to people that have actually had abortions it's incredible how the left just act like it's going to the salon for like Botox for the day or something or you know just go yeah no big thing just abortion today like I mean it's talk about sensitivity and tolerance these people are real inconsiderate if you want to be politically correct about abortion if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
