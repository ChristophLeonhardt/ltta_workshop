00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,710
on Sunday night as torrential rain
started to pound houston bradley allen

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,469
started to worry about his 88 year old
dad home alone levels of the bio were

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,990
going up at a drastic rate what happened
what were you thinking about call dad

4
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:20,010
tell him to get out there's more rain on
the way Bradley was monitoring the news

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:24,779
and satellite information so he saw the
flooding begin to subsume his dad's

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,119
neighborhood and knew the situation was
dire was there a moment where you were

7
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:38,070
fearing the worst every day because we
could not verify factual that he was out

8
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,440
of the house the only solace was this
photo that family members spotted in the

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,329
New York Times it appeared to show the
back of Harrison Allen loaded with other

10
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:54,329
evacuate in a flooded dump truck but
they still had no idea where he was how

11
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:02,309
many churches and shelters do you think
you combed a lot probably in the 40s or

12
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,650
50s you went to 40 or 50 face to face
they also handed out this missing poster

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:14,040
but still no luck until Wednesday night
when CNN put the poster on TV and Chris

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,259
interviewed Bradley he doesn't have a
phone in this day and age if people lose

15
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,970
their cell phone you remember everything
number to call and an emergency if

16
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,780
you're 88 years old they definitely
don't as soon as I thought I knew it was

17
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,619
him mark yeah Quebec is one of the
managers at a nearby Double Tree Hotel

18
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:39,180
that has taken in hundreds of evacuees
I'm watching CNN and I see the story on

19
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,899
this missing gentleman I took on my
phone and I took a picture of the screen

20
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,930
and I immediately called the hotel
because I knew he was still here and

21
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,450
then we were able to make the connection
on Thursday morning Bradley and his

22
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,799
family drove hours from outside of
Austin to the Double Tree to find his

23
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:04,520
dad who was just thanking mark for his
help when Bradley dashed up hey buddy oh
