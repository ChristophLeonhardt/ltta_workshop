so far our viewers who are joining us
now we are live from the streets of
Baltimore this is West Baltimore we are
walking towards the intersection between
Penn and North that is pretty much the
epicenter of everything that's been
going on not only the looting and the
violence that we witnessed on Monday but
also peaceful protests when the American
state of emergency was reinstated as the
curfew came into place
it is now 9:40 and of course 20 minutes
before curfew starts at 10:00 and today
many people are telling us it's a
historic day because it's a it's a
joyful mood it's a celebrity mode in the
city people are pretty happy with the
fact that the state attorney has decided
to charge the six officers involved in
the Freddie gray incident and we start
seeing some of the celebrations for
example right here nice
what happened today it started
have you been celebrating what have you
been doing today
my mouth anybody like my lighter
people morning people don't really news
ready we celebrate turn
freedom because people are telling us
you know that they are out past curfew
this is really the intersection I was
mentioning to you guys there's a hashtag
and the curfew some of the protesters
and there have been protesting by the
hundreds by the way some of them are
saying that they want to stay out past
curfew which should be interesting and
perhaps problematic because the National
Guard is out here
or is the police as well and they have
said that they will arrest anybody who's
not media properly credentialed who has
a letter from their boss
saying that they're required to be us
out like us and also people who are
essential businesses so everything
non-essential people should stay indoors
okay we are here at the intersection and
we're going to continue showing you guys
a little bit of what the mood is like
Frederick Frederick is someone really
nice we met him the first day when we
were broadcasting live he helped us with
security what you doing with a bat no I
just got my back you know that I'm
saying I feel like you know I'm saying
even though you know they are I'm going
to charge the officers or they have
charged off I just feel like you know
the odds need to be even for like you
know they got the chills and spits
I don't feel fulfilled within the line
neighborhood you know with the bats and
the labs and the ar-fifteens in that 8k
47 or wherever so therefore you know I
got my back I'm saying yes because we
know even though babies once about even
though they discharged I still feel like
dogs it's not they're gonna retaliate
after all y'all are going after all this
is over the National Guard is gone and
all that they're gonna retaliate or
individual basis on case-by-case
individual basis they really
I'm sorry interrupt you I wanted to ask
you like the first day we met
today's today is a whole lot different
today everybody's happened because truly
speaking even though you know we're in
the hood we're here where everything at
all but it's a lot of people that's not
even us in a lot of these people you
know when they said okay then dynam the
first day this is the first day that
shuttle addiction really came out here
and said you know what she's saying and
she really showed some emotion I'm gonna
net all of us at the time she never
showed no emotion she felt like she was
on the defensive she shot away and what
was really going on but this is the
first time this will really show
something I want to show these girls in
the car and people celebrating because I
think this is these are you know these
are seeing
Eric let's walk towards this car I want
to show
let's try it
a little bit further down there we're
going to try to walk on the sidewalk
here perhaps to go a little bit faster
because there is a small very small
large walking down
and we want to try to maybe catch up
with them
if people are it seems like the strategy
has been for the marchers with the
protesters to move around constantly
they walked miles today since the
announcement until essentially now they
went all the way to the city hall and
then they came back here they've been
walking on said they're not staying in
one place and it's a slight change of
event Eric and we stopped on maybe show
justice for Freddie great justice for
Freddie gray
five baths walk all the way down to
Pennsylvania
that's what for Freddie
okay we need to buy tomorrow do you guys
think
George Zimmerman he had all his charges
filed against him but he was not found
guilty so therefore I think all of those
offices should be found guilty and due
to the fact that this curfew is an
effect I think it should be lifted for
us to watch the Mayweather fight and
enjoy our family and friends because we
will not be out here riding tomorrow for
another day we just want to see a happy
day a happy day okay guys thank you very
much because yeah thank you okay so that
very very small protest right there at
the back I don't know if you guys to see
it we were chasing them but they're
walking pretty fast and I'm guessing
that the group that doesn't want to stay
past curfew these people seem to either
be going home or finishing their protest
or they're gonna keep on walking we
really don't know because we couldn't
catch up with them but we're gonna talk
to you know people here out in the
street people who asked a few approaches
obviously and it's almost 10 minutes
so if we want to get a sense of what's
going on
we did but we try to catch up with them
for viewers who are joining us now we
are trimming live from West Baltimore on
a very important day for the community
here a lot of people have told us are
extremely happy its historic
they basically couldn't believe it was
an astonishing turn of events that the
state attorney announced that all six
officers who arrested Freddie gray would
be charged one of them with
second-degree murder so people wanted to
hear that they wanted to have these
officers punished they say people should
be accountable for what they do and they
seem to be quite happy really with the
outcome of the event today of course
because it was unexpected everybody is
sort of celebrating some other people
are a little bit more skeptical those
who are you know thought about the
implications long-term and they said
this really isn't going to change
yesterday did you lose your voice almost
yeah yeah people who are watching you
know of right now we're broadcasting
live that this is important and that
people are happy but I mean do you think
it's gonna change later
yeah I love how police give us how the
police about the whole everything they
got some people still based on where
and then they you gotta change ourselves
as well we can't get mail Italy saw some
killers we kill each other a lot of
things still gotta say we make it change
No
coming
we don't like her
No
I think we could hear them but I don't
matter of our viewers busy tell others
we have bureaucracies our Eternal Father
Lord
I got
but I will go back let's do it I got
his business
flew by the coast even Dmitri rule
they basically returned are they joining
because of because of the coachman is
because he says that we have a right to
assemble peacefully
teraflop so great
how can you tell how can you pose a
confluence unless martial law is
implemented I mean we're not even
watching wrong so they can surely can't
oppose don't free okay if you know don't
you have a right I guess it's like an
emeritus state of emergency right that's
how they're justified right northern of
the implement I'll cuff you
haha martial law has to be defrayed you
know to stay amongst and the
Constitution says that we have a right
to assemble peacefully and only thing we
do is we pack perhaps you're right I get
a feeling that the that happiness was
short-lived and we're sort of happy
earlier on today right and now they seem
no I think I think I think I see I think
that the happiness still here this
desert is rebellion that it's not as not
anger this is just rebellion the
frustration against the powers that be
watch for the delay
you know what the idea
oh the tub you the mayor the
prosecutor already admitted that a crime
was committed
charge so these are all grown people
young people but they're being denied
the right to be peaceful like they're
being peaceful children loud without
being robbed why do you have to go in
people are dying on the street
there's a a policeman here trying to
push people out as far as we can see
they don't seem to want to go Garfield
oh it's essentially five minutes past
it's not tense at all but we wonder what
do you say people what we're late going
in the house we didn't damage it nothing
right right that mean what do you thinks
gonna happen because we were here like a
week ago that was we try to please now
this is for the city we're not gonna
mess out city up yeah you need to make a
change and we don't make no more
there'll be no change we live around
here
when you're gone we still got to deal
with this so we won't say no we have to
do every day all day for Freddie gray so
you think these people are gonna stay
out and defy the girl
they staring here lean out City Hall
they're trying to make a change we don't
make a change will make a change for us
nobody you know a small group of people
but much royal up the hill of here run
straight down walk near the City Hall
here we got some justice you know they
do that to try to keep the peace tattle
but let's see a change we gotta stick
together
it's already past curfew slightly
different scene than the night before
when we have been out here past curfew
one time we got tear-gassed
and there was a very very very heavy
police presence there's still a police
presence I want to show you a device
where the police are stationed basically
the line of
police officers involved in the Freddie
gray case are going to be charged one of
them with second-degree
because the crowd today is really happy
and celebrating it would be interesting
to see what the police will do and the
National Guard which is by the way out
here in large large numbers what they
will do because it's faster fear and
these people they theory should not be
out here they only very very few people
have gotten permit
a lot of people are complaining on
Twitter because this is
is a media area that has been set up
heading towards that area to be behind
the yellow tape and everybody who got in
that area could be violating the curfew
of in theory
where are we going to go conversation to
take this line start moving
it's very wide it's basically there's
almost more reporters than people out
here to be honest I think err do you
think we can sort of pan and show that
Oh
we got we know we know you know we got
Louisa but we ain't no II didn't know
we'd have the police still out here why
do they get together but we got what we
live here but we over here when we play
live make it like that that is not know
how can they tell like like we're babies
oh go back to sleep go back to bed no no
no where we live here this is our home
this is where we live all the time you
can just come in here with your tanks
and your police Oh to go to war whether
you live here there are kids there were
kids on the street whenever throwing gas
no respecter people's lives how much
spectre people's home Justin Upton is
ghetto just ahead to the middle of the
city
that's not me people don't live here
people who raise families here you guys
are throwing gas and all types of smoke
bombs and all types of they
think thought only thugs have your over
thugs Oh
just looking you suck if you want
behind the media while we're not trying
to get any value please please Peter why
don't we have immediately
this young lady because I did not know
what was going on and that's when I
walked up I said I don't know what's
going on but I don't like what I'm
hearing about how singer and feels nigga
that's the last thing we should be
talking about on camera in front of
America we should be talking about the
issues what's going to be the holistic
plan that we're going to develop to
adjust the issues of our youth about the
education reform criminal justice reform
and economic development it is about
financial literacy with literacy health
and wholeness opponents academic support
services these kids don't have tutors do
you understand like I'm a huge advocate
for yeah okay
we don't have to be Jamaican mind one
another that's what I didn't know what
was going on when I walked up on the
scene and I was trying to glean
clarification that's it
and that she wanted to tell me go ahead
with your live blog and you don't even
know what's going why our people have
issues within one another and that's why
we can't unite we believe
okay some
some people are putting on masks gasps
now we don't really know what's going to
happen but there is another large police
line over there
and they seem to get bleep getting ready
to make a move in any case we'll keep
recording for a while to see
there are people getting arrested down
by the City Hall and that is downtown
it's about a 15 minute 20-minute drive
from here so we may interrupt this
transmission and go over there but first
of all we want to see the outcome of the
situation things things seem pretty calm
the streets have really emptied out this
intersection has really emptied out all
the media's pen down over there at that
area behind the
yeah we're gonna see what happens with
them what do you think I mean
exactly okay
at some point we may want to get back to
that line
I'm not saying yeah but you know
what are you guys thinking
see all
yeah working on my mind they're on the
way back I think we should say okay
I'm right behind you and as they get
closer I don't mean that way okay
so this is how it usually starts that
happen to us the other day the police
line is basically closing in on the few
very very few protesters that are still
out here
they've dispersed the crowd using some
very very mild version of teargas more
like pepper spray okay
we're gonna pull back behind here to see
we can get a shot of I'm keep on
broadcasting what's happening
okay you see where the line is just in
case your car on that side yeah but I
think we have to get it over there other
way
okay okay let's go let's go do it let's
go beyond the line and we can keep it
sharp
yep get it guys I'm
Eric if we have to go and look at this
look behind this is this I know
good okay we'll stay here until further
notice you think
did you know film yo but you don't fill
full yo
say what
I think we should think of a man do you
think we should get back to the
eventually to that area it's a good
yellow
let's just not lose arms and it's
peaceful right yeah I mean that's good
yeah you guys gonna dog in the media
like seriously
I don't understand it's just essentially
media love yeah huh I don't have my
first pass out here can I have yours I
could stay next okay I'll send it well I
wanted to they have said that we're not
everybody's outside the other line I
mean I don't know your call
no I was fine
so just our recup to our viewers there's
a quite a thick line of policemen rival
ease-out getting close to where the
media staging area is there's very few
protesters left out and previously as
this has happened they've dispersed
people with some form of pepper spray we
don't really know what's going to have a
nice but I mean everything's very calm
here and there's really sort of no need
for this
inhumane newest
people all day and I can tell you is
there were a dozen flowers in the
streets and there's I mean it's
essentially media and really no more
than twenty people as far as I can see
mister kind of completeness of course if
it's only again the few people who
remain out
the media staging area that's the Metro
right there
it's emptier what's going on here
because it's only
essentially reporters who are left very
very few protesters we saw a couple
at the most
I don't know exactly who they are
gasping
so while
a short break we are going to stop our
transmission right now thank you for
joining us we will be bringing you
another transmission live if it merits
right now it seems like a massive show
of force for no particular reason
everybody left here is a member of the
media we are all authorized to be here
past curfew so we will be joining you
shortly if the situation merits all you
do is simple English I understand I do
okay thank you because I my call over
there and I've seen them snatch people
so I don't trust them
my name's Chuck more ghetto I'm a better
citizen journalists covered snatches so
I honestly don't trust my sword and
snatch people so I want you to get this
just in case in case something that
happens
Joseph Kent I was born I was 10 feet
away when they snatched Joseph's kid
okay I turned that up ten feet away
come this way they're cat alive and we
go let's go how do I get to my car walk
the other
Eric Mercer live
we're broadcasting live right now in
second we're trying to understand sort
of what is it that would elicit without
the permission from the I'm trying to
ask what are the instructions for the
media right now are recently to stand
right the media had to say right here
these are boxes for the media you guys
are free to leave from a place that's
attack no no okay so what is that what
does the prisoner you have a radio right
here so what is the purpose of you have
to sign right here I understand you know
what a curfew I'm aware of that
in effect that's an applied I'm aware
where does introducing tactical
operations to make sure that the press
receipt
that's the purpose of attacking
operation that's impressive that's why
we have the press right here
I see so but what is the purpose of
their of their tactical operations the
music you're appointed the press from
above so I'm pointing to your colleagues
right I don't see anybody but a guy with
a camera okay well if you look right
over there you see the gentleman wearing
the riot gear I believe they're your
brothers
I know what movie with
yeah I think it could be something else
could have
they want to go to the other than the
tape and so people aspire
your safety not ours all right I
remember some faces outside your t-shirt
do sell out get a mental picture it's
for your sake
all of them
okay
so who's the recap of what's been going
on today it was a very important day
also quite unexpected everybody thought
that there wasn't going to be any animal
and no results into the investigation of
the incident the arrests and then later
the further death of Freddie gray
but there was it would be the turn of
events the state attorney announced that
she was going to press charges against
the six officers involved in the Freddie
gray incident people took to the streets
in massive amounts there were also
protests all of them peaceful people
were very very happy with the outcome
they essentially wanted to hear that
these officers will be tried that's
really all people were asking for I mean
and we talked to people of all
backgrounds all ages and also we talked
to a lot of people from the neighborhood
where Freddie gray was probable
it's 7:40 20 minutes past curfew and
everybody pretty much went home there is
a media staging area that we're going to
show you again this is what you guys
have been saving we're reporting from
inside the media withstanding area and
outside just basically military
apparently getting ready to the home as
well please leave this area
okay
that our dispatchers are off
talking to the major players in this
who shot the video and ultimately showed
the world what happened to Freddie gray
the day of his arrest we talked to the
second person who was
we're trying to
in a peaceful manner and try to sell
those agitators when people do it
starting
and try to come you know
mr. live
I did
