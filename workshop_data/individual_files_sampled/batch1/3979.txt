so you've talked a lot about how important the culture is getting the right people the big company elsewhere in the valley Google is made a huge to-do about 20% time and why the developers have to have time to dream and think of their products and the projects and so forth what do you think of that do you have 20% time here well we do things a bit differently I mean we have a culture that's very focused on um being very focused on what we're building so focus is a really important part of it but it wasn't at Google for a long time now it seems to be in vogue so they may be saying you know the focus is better so but at the same time we want to make sure that everyone can come and and add their ideas I mean some of the best ideas throughout the company's evolution they have just been from just places all throughout the company whether it's an engineer or you know someone on the customer support team or just different I'm just different areas around the company so we've always had these hackathons right that are basically time that we allocate that the only rules that you don't work on what you work on the rest of the time and it's basically an incubator for people to prototype different ideas much in the spirit of how Facebook out found it originally the idea you can build anything good in a day or a couple of days right and get a version of that running so you get it running you then test it internally and then we can see that helps us shape the roadmap and what we want to do in the future but we also have a culture where we want to stay very focused and we don't want to run with a lot of projects that we don't expect to launch right so so we want to get a lot of ideas help have those ideas shape where we want to go and then execute in a very focused way on the stuff that we're gonna do but I mean our culture I mean we have a few values that are really important to us and one which I talked about before is just moving fast right the whole company is really optimized around someone joining being able to build something very quickly be able to launch it quickly iterate very quickly on that get feedback quickly that moving fast ethos is a huge part of what we do and another big part of it which we've kind of talked about is is just this idea of wanting to be bold right in the decisions that we make and we we have this belief that you never build something great by doing it the same way that other people have done it so there are a lot of things that there are best practices around but for the core things that we want to do when we have the decision to either do it the same way that someone else has done it or do it in a different way we're gonna choose to do it in a different way and we really encourage people all throughout the company to to like to think about things in that way and make bolder decisions but it's think about it come up with ideas executed in very small form and then we'll decide as a company whether we're gonna go for it it's not everybody has their own pet project that they're working on we're gonna have 78 different products and data and we'll see what works and so forth well I mean we encourage people to build things in their in their free time as well right and anything but that's a lot of what Google's done with their program so we have that all the time I mean are like the people here just building stuff like night and day and their venues where people can can experiment with that
