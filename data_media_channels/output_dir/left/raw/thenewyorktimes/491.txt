1
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,834
If any Arab population needed a revolution, 

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,375
it was Yemen. 

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:16,667
If we talk about poverty, there is no one poorer.

4
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:19,917
If we talk about illiteracy, there is no one more illiterate.

5
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:23,375
If we talk about corruption,

6
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:27,125
there is no regime more corrupt than the one that was in Yemen.

7
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:31,083


8
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:41,042
I was born in 1972.

9
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,751
We were a poor family.

10
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,042
Society then was traditional, but it was colorful.

11
00:00:49,584 --> 00:00:52,125
The women participated in everything.

12
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:55,500
In the market, in the bakeries; buying, selling.

13
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:04,459
Things started to change when we reached the mid-80s.

14
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:08,626
Each year, society was becoming stricter. 

15
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:14,917
The status of women was a real problem.

16
00:01:16,584 --> 00:01:19,167
Sana became full of weapons and tribes.

17
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,626
The revolution didn’t start in a day.

18
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:33,500
In 2006, a coalition of civil society organizations was formed. 

19
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,209
I was one of the leaders. 

20
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:38,459
We protested and organized sit-ins.

21
00:01:39,334 --> 00:01:40,584
Freedom! 

22
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:46,042
On Jan. 24, 2011, we were following what was happening in Tunisia.

23
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:46,042
When a corrupt ruler in an Arab country goes down by a popular act;

24
00:01:51,167 --> 00:01:54,667
it was, for us, an impossible dream.

25
00:01:54,876 --> 00:02:01,167
That day, I woke up earlier than usual, 

26
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:06,500
feeling that I had a big mission to accomplish.

27
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,667
We stood in front of the Tunisian Embassy

28
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:13,042
and I told an Al Jazeera reporter that I had a message I wanted to send to President Saleh.

29
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,500
I hope that the movement progresses and for the fall of the regime of Ali Abdullah Saleh, 

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,876
who threatened us with Afghanization, Iraqization, and Somalization.

31
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,292
Today, we say to him, 

32
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:29,417
we threaten him with Tunisization!

33
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:36,500
When I was saying those words I felt like I was shaking the throne of tyranny.

34
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:43,125
When I remember the first days of the revolution,

35
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:48,751
I feel that, for a few days, we were able 

36
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:53,083
to create a whole country in a small area. 

37
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:56,709
Not more than one kilometer maybe.

38
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:02,375
We created a Yemen that was united, collaborative and respectful of one another.

39
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:07,042
Yemeni women were at the front of this revolution.

40
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:12,002
Most of the marches were led by women.

41
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,667
Women’s issues were strongly represented in 2011; in its beginning.

42
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:26,334
There were slogans and banners

43
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:30,334
about maternal mortality, child marriage,

44
00:03:30,334 --> 00:03:34,792
about women being the victims of illiteracy, poverty.

45
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:40,459
Then the women started to get pushed away from the platform.

46
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,709
To the back, to the back, to the back. 

47
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:52,626
In less than a month, they were beaten in the square where they had previously led. 

48
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:58,459


49
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,125


50
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:07,209


51
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:12,334
The important women’s issues I wanted to discuss 

52
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:19,876
were the issues of women in decision-making positions, women’s health and child marriage. 

53
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,751
Unfortunately just as the women were pushed away from the revolutionary scene,

54
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:29,626
their voices were crushed in the dialogue conference. 

55
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:32,876
The women barely advanced at all in the revolution.

56
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:39,292
Yemen is always at war. Even if it isn’t declared, it’s a war. 

57
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,667
There is the war against Al Qaeda, there is the war waged by Al Qaeda. 

58
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:45,792
There is the war between Houthis and Salafists.

59
00:04:45,792 --> 00:04:50,709
There is the war between the Congregation for Reform and the Houthis.

60
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:54,876
The women called for peace and it’s a state of war.

61
00:04:55,167 --> 00:05:00,042
I know a very progressive official in the country who said very clearly,

62
00:05:00,042 --> 00:05:02,000
“Now is not the time for women.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,751
For their freedom. It’s not the right time.”

64
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:10,626
Everyone, including women, is saying that it’s not the time.

65
00:05:11,167 --> 00:00:00,000
But when is the time?
