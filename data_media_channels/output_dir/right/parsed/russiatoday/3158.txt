previously on a great American
pilgrimage let's embark on a pilgrimage
of knowledge the great American
pilgrimage Esmond God Gilgamesh
pilgrimage children throughout a
pilgrimage citrus pilgrimage baby hey
everybody I'm Stephen Baldwin gosh I
look fantastic
Hollywood guy usual suspects my favorite
movie proud American first of all I'm
dressed as George Washington Shore and
RV enthusiast uncle Steve this is my
buddy max famous financial guru and will
he's a little bit different last but not
least my larger-than-life cranium an
aspiring star reowww
with all the drama happening in our
great country I'm hitting the road to
have some fun
me everyday Americans see a nice frosty
bud on here George :
frosty bud
well with what's America do you
our ancestors suffered the most and see
how things got so crazy I was naked
completely naked he bit my finger
hopefully start to bridge the gap this
is the great American pilgrimage
and I tell you what I might be late for
my own pilgrimage
I might just have to trust in the good
Lord on this one
sometimes
moments like this demand
great great
like say and there goes the guy in front
of me
you're the same I'm buying that product
quality what I find that
quality circuit breaker break that
number down max he's one of us he's on
the pilgrim it's a new day on the great
American pilgrimage and our heroes are
entering a new land
Arizona
I didn't think you can add another task
to what you're doing while driving but
eating soup while kind of your dog while
texting while driving while talking on
the phone
come on a pilgrimage means anything is
possible
dear God in heaven
gosh you look fantastic
seek help first words my daughter Haley
Baldwin ever spoke seatbelt
she's been going that that mother we get
in the car and we're driving for 30
seconds and in a car seat Haley Baldwin
goes keep up because every time they on
the card I would say seat belt first
word you ever said was seat belt and
it's ironic that they could be your last
even heroes get a little tired so the RV
pulls over for Steven to get some rest
maintaining energy is essential for the
pilgrimage to go on
back on the road max can't help but
notice the glaring Desert Sun sparking
thoughts on energy for America's future
dropping like everything else that's the
magic of free-market capitalism I think
it's an Amsterdam to putting in roads
that are solar panels
take it in
of all that space while Stephen attempts
to take a catnap
who's driving your guess is as good as
mine the energies out here the windmills
are capturing it solar panels are
capturing it
you could cover up the state of Nevada
with solar panels and power the entire
United States that's all the energy in
it
why not about making everything cheaper
and more efficient so that you get
wealth distributed more evenly that's
what we fought the Revolutionary War for
revolt all over again maybe
babies up maybe on this trip to give me
the spark
the great American pilgrimage give me
the great American revolutionary
declaration
and war against Ola goblins
analysts the kleptocracy the cactus
stock receipt
yeah the CAC of stock receipt ruled by
the least qualified that's what we got
now
it's no good gotta change
Stephen awakens from his slumber but
anyway look at let me point something
out here that is a green plants how does
a green plant work photo synthesis it
takes in carbon it farts oxygen we are
breathing plant parts that's what we
rely on to survive on the planet
photosynthesis it's a completely
efficient market there's no waste that's
what we can do we can do it right now
except we're all wrapped up in our
little petty divisions political
infighting it's killing us dude we need
to join hands
yeah
yeah
Oh
where do we go from there 99 bottles of
beer on the wall
I miss Arizona max we miss Beth oh those
are good times young riders josh brolin
all my old friends might just remember
some of them folks on pilgrimage I don't
know if they'll talk to us though yes
you know they think I'm a little cuckoo
at this point which I am so in the tier
8 years
Tucson my eldest daughter Ally oh just
got married was born here in Arizona
well it's good to be back on the
pilgrimage and it's gonna bring back a
lot of fun memories for me it's almost a
bit of a pilgrimage and its own right
but read charger was a cop that's how
Arizona rolls yeah flashy lights on the
back windshield oh he's like pull it
over yeah as they close in on their
first stop in Arizona
our heroes can't help but focus on the
political topics ahead of them
the citrus farm yesterday
about agriculture that agriculture
requires labor cheap labor a lot of
cheap labor so if you clamp down on the
immigration you're gonna kill the
farmers in a lot of ways right what
would he do but meat packing industry
Chicago is all illegal immigrants nobody
wants to go pick a minimum wage to put
their hand in a bandsaw you get it
chopped up and end up in a games burger
for somebody's dog in San Francisco so
if you get rid of the immigration you
have to accept that these businesses are
going to fail so flip that on its head
for me dr. max and tell me
so everybody's staying because we need
the workers and that's the conversation
that should be had in other words if
you're going to make a decision about
immigration the full scope of the
problem should be laid out in full so
that the end one how it impacts this
decision that's right well I don't know
enough about it I obviously don't know
as much as you I sure would like to have
a conversation
with a metaphorical hunger for knowledge
and a literal hunger for food Stephen
and Max visit a local restaurant to talk
with an immigrant couple who achieved
the American dream
I appreciate this on tree your name Lily
and Stephen Baldwin nice to see you Max
Keiser I Lillian are some say Oh Steve
how are you nice to see you
kee Max Keiser how are you good
please welcome thank you okay
well good Wow
where am I in Phoenix Arizona where what
is this place that is Cafe Pinot is
Italian with French flair but one of my
favorite things it's a big surprise in
Arizona was the pizza the best pizza in
the state of Arizona if I understand
correctly is Pino right here voila
and do I detect a bit of an accent yes
so where are you from
I'm born in Tunisia and my parents moved
to France when I was 12 years old to the
price and after that I have a good
situation in France I have a big company
I sold my company in 1979 I decide with
my wife to leave France for the dream we
are to come to the United States with
three kids three kids in no age it was
two years old same with my wife and our
mother so she stayed two more
but when I have to be something I do it
I don't think about it just do it so I
adapt very quickly we have no choice we
need to make work we walk eight days a
week
and we have no choice paid this weekend
we can use that we can't have the dream
L not the kid the kid of the delivery
maybe they deserve to be citizen to me I
think we are the dreamers of work do all
the paperwork I do on the line for 15
years but we do a first sleep with my
wife
we came to United States we visit 12
states and on the 12 state we pick up
Phoenix at the time in 1981 we pick up
Phoenix why because I remember my father
told me all the time when you see a lot
of tower or a lot of construction the
business is good that's it I see a lot
construction a lot of power a lot of
building to maybe this city is good so
here immigrants well I am an immigrant I
came with visa l to my passport was all
right in
at the time when I passed the border
that we talked about night
8081 when I pass the ball girl I was
naked
completely naked
when I pass the border I was naked
completely naked while Stephen has his
own stories about being naked something
we won't get into he remains in awe of
this immigrant couple my happy day was
that when I talked is possible and I put
on the garbage I prayed with an American
passport that's all we we absolutely it
was not fun me you you accept everything
you accept everything you accept the
whole of the country you decide to leave
could you immigrant today and to America
as in the same way no no it's more
difficult is more difficult I think to
people from all York to immigrate for
United States so I feel good because you
know what I think about France all of
England or Germany you see the sign
outside open house is the same thing all
this country our open house you come and
you say you come from everywhere and you
stay didn't control the border at all
and that is very bad and from my green
card I apply for the US citizen and 13
years after I get my green my US citizen
in 1994 and I received by the senator of
the consignee at the time the flag of
United States he was flying in my name
in Washington for my citizenship is a
big honor
who is that just for you it was because
they liked my story and and really found
me and they give to do a flag a flag and
this flag now a second yes
what did that meet here like they gave
it to you are they are big for me feel
more American than any American your
heart more than everybody yeah I feel
more Americans than every major American
than any American living here and I was
very happy very very happy okay yes

make a pizza - pizza
what kind of pizza we do a margarita a
new base pizza - pizza
yeah who's gonna make a second pizza
view you make one and make one so he
start that you see the way you he's
faithful
but an owwie opening more slow to find
the size right side what up that is the
best size please don't ask me to do this
yes is difficult because the dough is
tough - well are you - the sauce on the
middle yeah and you go along like that
if you're like Mickey do you like a
little extra sauce yes always and we put
the cheese on top for the basic pizza
like that and this is just a normal he's

dirty services on to the business of
reserved seats ever present to Sarah
Mary suppose as you to non-linearity
mountain and minor about the
okay G while we wait for the pizza yes
dude you're in a second question one of
the topics is border what yes I think I
already know what you think but I want
to know it's too much
it's not enough what do you think he's
never not enough I think when you create
the border you create a line like any
company like like any country you need
to respect the border and go when you
pass the border you need to pass with
urgency and make your paper and pass the
ball like everybody else but now I think
you have to create a pizza called the
wall yeah like my oven is not big enough
that was funny yeah
since you started me come they popped
open see salami didn't miss a few dishes
here come on before digested are cool
discs the new value I see Polly Polly

you know that we justify CEO down and
do you think that has happened
what's happening what's going on billion
