DID HE EXECUTE? HE DID. Sean: I SAW YOU AFTER EVERY DEBATE. AND HE GOT BETTER AND BETTER. Sean: I'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD TALK ABOUT, THIS IS GOING TO BE A LONG-WINDED LEAD UP TO A QUESTION. I'VE BEEN POINTING OUT ON THIS PROGRAM, 1873, MISHANDLING OF INFORMATION, IT WOULD APPLY TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. IF I WAS SUBPOENAED FOR ALL OF MY EMAILS AND I DELETED 33,000 AND I ASKED TO WASH MY HARD DRIVE, NO ONE HEARD OF BLEACH UNTIL HILLARY CLINTON AND THEY BUSTED UP ALL MY DEVICES THE WAY SHE HAD HAPPENED. I'VE NEVER HEARD OF AN EXONERATION BEING WRITTEN IN MAY BEFORE YOU INTERVIEW SEVEN KEY WITNESSES AND THE MAIN PERSON HILLARY CLINTON IN JULY, THE PERSON THAT DOES THE INTERVIEW HATES THE OPPONENT OF HILLARY CLINTON AND THEY EXONERATE HER FOR I BELIEVE OBVIOUS FELONIES. THEN THEY TALK ABOUT RUSSIA COLLUSION, HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DNC FUNNELED MONEY THROUGH A LAW FIRM, PERKINS COIE, A FOREIGN NATIONAL WE HEARD WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED IN OUR ELECTIONS, CHRISTOPHER STEELE GETS RUSSIAN SOURCES. THE FBI NEVER VERIFIES IT, THEY PRESENTED TO A FISA COURT TO SPY ON AMERICAN CITIZENS, A DRUM CAMPAIGN ASSOCIATE WEEKS BEFORE AN ELECTION. THEY NEVER VERIFIED, THEY NEVER CORROBORATED TO, THEY NEVER TOLD THE JUDGE IN THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION, THREE SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS THAT HILLARY PAID FOR IT AND THEY NEVER VERIFIED IT. MR. MAYOR, WERE LOST BROKEN? LET'S START WITH HILLARY. YES. 13 CRIMES SHE COMMITTED, THEN WE GOT UP TO ABOUT 18. I'M SORRY, HILLARY, I KNOW YOU'RE VERY DISAPPOINTED YOU DIDN'T WIN. BUT YOU'RE A CRIMINAL. EQUAL JUSTICE WOULD MEAN YOU SHOULD GO TO JAIL. I DO NOT KNOW WHY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS NOT INVESTIGATING. Sean: THE JAMES COMEY? JAMES COMEY FIXED THE WHOLE CASE. YOU CAN'T READ THAT STUPID REPORT THAT HE WROTE THAT SAID WERE NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE NO REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD INDICT HER. NO HONEST REASONABLE PROSECUTOR WOULD INDICT HER. Sean: HE SAID YESTERDAY, HILLARY DEEPLY RESPECTS THE RULE OF LAW, JIM COMEY SAID THAT. WHILE. THIS IS A VERY PERVERTED MAN. Sean: DO WE HAVE A TWO TO YOUR DIGESTIVE SYSTEM IN? WE HAVE ONE FOR HILLARY AND ALL OF THOSE DEMOCRATS, BILL CLINTON. YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS, NOT JUST FOR PRESIDENT, BUT OUR COUNTRY, THERE'S GOING TO BE A WITCH HUNT AGAINST REPUBLICANS. YOU HAVE A MAN ON WHO LOST ALL HIS MONEY, FOR WHAT REASON, HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG. WE ARE LUCKY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO CAN FOCUS, IN A WAY IT ALMOST HURTS HIM BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY CAN DO ANYTHING TO HIM AND HE'S GOING TO REMAIN FOCUSED ON NORTH KOREA, IRAN, HOW DO WE HELP ISRAEL, WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT TAXES? SPEW ON THE ECONOMY HAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY THE MEDIA NEVER FOCUSES ON. IF WE HAD THE HILLARY STANDARD, IT WOULD NEVER BE UNDER OATH, NEVER BE TRANSCRIBED, ALL THE WITNESSES THAT WOULD BE FAVORABLE IN THE ROOM, IMMUNIZED. Sean: WE WRITE TO THE EXONERATION BEFORE THE INTERVIEW THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE A THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE R THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE E THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE T THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE O THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE D THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE S THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE R THEN WE WOULD DISAGREE Y INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE, THEN EITHER YOU OR RUSH LIMBAUGH WOULD DO THE INTERVIEW. RUSH AND I WOULD NOT OBJECT. Sean: IS A POLITICAL REPORT SUGGESTING THAT MUELLER WOULD CONSIDER IVANKA TRUMP A TARGET. LOOK AT HOPE HICKS AS ONE EXAMPLE. SHE PAID MORE IN LAWYERS AND SHE WAS EVER PAID. I WISH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE COULD GET TO KNOW HER, SHE'S ONE OF THE NICEST HUMAN BEINGS YOU'RE EVER GOING TO MEET. SHE IS VERY LOYAL TO DONALD TRUMP. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD SAY THIS, SHE COULD STAND UP TO HIM WHEN SHE HAD TO. WHAT THEY DID TO HER IS OUTRAGEOUS. IVANKA TRUMP? I WOULD GET ON MY CHARGER AND GO INTO THE WRITERS ROOM WITH A LANCE IF GO AFTER HIM. HER. IF THE GO AFTER HER, THE WHOLE COUNTRY WILL TURN ON THEM. GERRIT IS A FINE MAN, YOU KNOW THAT. MEN ARE DISPOSABLE. A FINE WOMAN LIKE IVANKA? COME ON. Sean: LET'S BRING UP THE ISSUES WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON THIS SHOW. HILLARY CLINTON OBVIOUSLY COMMITTED FELONIES, YOU'VE IDENTIFIED THEM. I BELIEVE AS YOU DO, JAMES COMEY RINGS THAT. THEY HATE THE PRESIDENT, THEY HATED THE CANDIDATE, THEY TALK ABOUT AN INSURANCE POLICY. ANDREW McCABE LYING UNDER OATH, JAMES COMEY LEAKING FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING A SPECIAL COUNSEL. ALSO COMEY AND McCABE CONTRADICTING EACH OTHER. ONE OF THEM HAS TO BE LYING. I THINK COMEY IS LYING. McCABE ISN'T A SITUATIONAL LIAR. IF THIS WERE AN EQUAL SYSTEM OF JUSTICE, THEY WOULD ALL BE PROSECUTED. IT'S MY BIGGEST REGRET, I'M SORRY TO SAY THIS, IN NOT HAVING TAKEN THAT JOB. Sean: MY BIGGEST REGRET AND I LIKE JEFF SESSIONS, BUT HE NEVER SHOULD HAVE RECUSED HIMSELF. HE NEVER SHOULD'VE APPOINTED ROSENSTEIN. Sean: I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SOMEBODY BEING APPOINTED OR CONFIRMED. DO YOU KNOW THAT ROSENSTEIN WAS WITH MUELLER THE DAY HE WAS INTERVIEWED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP TO BE FBI DIRECTOR, KNEW THAT HE WAS TURNED DOWN AND THEN APPOINTED IN THE NEXT DAY? Sean: DID YOU KNOW ROD ROSENSTEIN ACCORDING TO REPORTS THAT WE HAVE ON THIS PROGRAM SIGNED OFF ON ONE OF THE FISA EXTENSIONS? THE ONE WITH THE UNVERIFIED DOSSIER, THE BULK OF INFORMATION AS THE GRASSLEY-GRAHAM MEMO? HE SIGNED OFF, DOES THAT NOT CONFLICT WITH ALL OF THIS? IS ALSO A WITNESS TO CRITICAL INFORMATION. FOR A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT PONTIFICATES I TOLD YOU. THE ONLY CRIMES COMMITTED ARE BY THE GOVERNMENT. Sean: ANDREW McCABE IT SAID WITHOUT THE DOSSIER, THERE WOULD'VE BEEN A FISA APPLICATION WOULD'VE BEEN A FISA APPLICATIO APPLICATION. I WOULD ASK YOU, DOESN'T THE FBI I WOULD ASK YOU, DOESN'T THE FB FBI, AND FBI PROTOCOL MANDATED THAT THEY VERIFY, CORROBORATE WHAT THEY PRESENT TO A FISA JUDGE. WOULDN'T IT BE MANDATORY TO IDENTIFY THE DOSSIER WAS CREATED BY AN OPPOSITION PARTY'S CANDIDATE AND NOT AS A POLITICAL ACTOR. ABSOLUTELY. OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE. INVASION OF PRIVACY ON NO BASIS AT ALL. IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATION. Sean: UNREASONABLE SEARCH AND SEIZURE. IF THEY SEARCHED YOU OR ME BASED ON THAT WE WOULD SUE THEM. I WORK WITH GREAT ATTORNEYS GENERAL, MY FRIEND GREAT ADMIRATION FOR MICHAEL. TO WATCH THIS HAPPEN UNDER A MAN THAT I LOVE, JEFF SESSIONS, I FEEL BAD. I KNOW THE PRESIDENT IS HEARTBROKEN OVER THIS, HE ISN'T ANGRY, HE'S HEARTBROKEN. THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED R THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED D THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED E THE TWO OF THEM SHOULD RECUSED M THEMSELVES, SESSIONS AND ROSENSTEIN. WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO GET CONVICTIONS, WERE SUPPOSED TO DO JUSTICE. Sean: LET ME STAY FOCUSED ON THE ISA ISSUE COME UP ROD ROSENSTEIN AFTER THEY SUBPOENAED THE DOCUMENTS WANTED TO PULVERIZE OFFICE BEGGING HIM NOT TO RELEASE IT. WE NEVER WOULD'VE HAD THE DEVIN NUNES MEMO THAT SAID THE BULK OF THE APPLICATION WAS THAT THE DOSSIER HILLARY PAID FOR MY QUESTION IS THIS. NOT ONLY THAT, THERE WERE THREE SUBSEQUENT RENEWALS WITH THE SAME FALSE INFORMATION, THE SAME LYING BY ADMISSION IF YOU WILL BY NOT TELLING THE FISA JUDGES THAT HILLARY PAID FOR IT. Sean: IF I STAND UP IN COURT AT SOMETIME IN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND I RECIT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS AND I RECIE THESE BACK, I THINK THE JUDGES ARE GOING TO LOOK AT ME AND SAY I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE. HOW COULD THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HAVE GONE SO FAR AWAY FROM THE FAIR AND HONEST ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE UNDER DECENT PEOPLE? I THINK THE PRESSURE ON THEM WAS SO GREAT, THEY JUST CAVED IN. THERE IS ONE WAY TO REDEEM THEMSELVES, GET CONTROL OF THIS REMEMBER SENATOR STEVENS CASE? Sean: HE LOST AN ELECTION, THEN THE JUDGE OVERTURNED AT ALL BECAUSE THEY WITHHELD EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT, THERE'S BEEN MORE GOVERNMENT MISCONDUCT IN THIS CASE AND THERE BEEN CONDUCT. Sean: THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN, BRUSH AND COLLUSION. GONE, HE'S BEEN CLEARED OF THAT. Sean: MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU CONCERNED IN THE PROCESS OF THIS WE DID DISCOVER THAT A FOREIGN NATIONAL, CHRISTOPHER STEELE WAS PAID THROUGH FUSION GPS, USED RUSSIAN SOURCES THAT NOT ONLY WEREN'T VERIFIED ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT WAS PAID FOR, TO MANIPULATE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE LEAD UP TO THE ELECTION? ISN'T THAT CLOSER TO THE MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: M MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: C MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: A MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: L MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: C MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: H MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: N MANDATE THAN MICHAEL: ? THAT MONEY WAS NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY, SORRY. I'M GIVING YOU A FACT THAT YOU DON'T KNOW. IT'S NOT CAMPAIGN MONEY. NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE. Sean: THEY FUNNELED IT THROUGH A LAW FIRM. THEY FUNNELED THROUGH A LAW FIRM AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID IT FIRM AND THE PRESIDENT REPAID I IT. Sean: THERE'S NO CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW. ZERO. EVERYBODY WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THIS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY HE PUT INTO THAT CAMPAIGN AND I SAID 130,000, THEY COULD DO A COUPLE OF CHECKS FOR 130,000. WHEN I HEARD HIS RETAINER OF 130,000 HE WAS DOING THE WORK FOR THE PRESIDENT. THAT'S HOW HE'S REPAYING IT WITH A LITTLE PROFIT IN THE LITTLE MARGIN. Sean: THE PRESIDENT WHAT ABOUT STOMACH DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS? HE KNEW HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF THINGS LIKE THIS, LIKE I TAKE CARE OF THIS WITH MY CLIENTS, I DON'T BURDEN THEM WITH EVERY SINGLE THING THAT COMES ALONG. Sean: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE RAID ON HIS OFFICE. ONE OF THE REASONS WE WOULD HESITATE TO COOPERATE ANY FURTHER, AND I THINK THIS IS THE BREAKDOWN WITH DOWD BACK IN JANUARY THAT TOOK THEM BY SURPRISE, THAT COULD BE BEYOND ANYTHING THAT IS AN OUTRAGEOUS VIOLATION OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE BEYOND WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE.
