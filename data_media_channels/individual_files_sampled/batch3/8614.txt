ALSO THIS MORNING SAID HE WAS SAID TO IMPOSE A TARIFF. Bret: THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO DEALING WITH A PUBLIC RELATIONS MESS TONIGHT INVOLVING IMMIGRANT CHILDREN. OFFICIALS SAY THERE ARE REPORTS THAT NEARLY 1500 KIDS ARE LOST BUT IT’S JUST NOT TRUE. ED HENRY LOOKS OUT THE FACTS TONIGHT. WHEN IVANKA TRUMP POSTED THIS PHOTO WITH HER YOUNG SON THIS WEEKEND, THE TROPEZ OF COMIC HATERS GOT TRIGGERED.
