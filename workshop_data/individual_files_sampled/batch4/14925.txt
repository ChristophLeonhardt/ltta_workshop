one of the things that I find similar between Trudeau and jag meet Singh is they're both very attractive men they'll say that as a straight man myself I'm not afraid to say that they're attractive they're both stylish they both are very strong with social media and therefore I think both of them were not properly vetted in terms of substance and what they stand for in fact one of the arguments for jag meet Singh was he can out Trudeau Trudeau in the selfies department in the fashion Department so I don't think people actually looked into what he stood for you have uncovered in your latest story let me just read the headline then I'll hand it over to you NDP Leader Jack made Singh link to seek rapper who promotes independent homeland that sounds sort of modest on the headline but when you look at what the Sikh rapper is saying it's pretty sure it's pretty shocking isn't it yeah esra they're very open and sort of like brash when it comes to the political ideology that they're promoting so the individual rapper it seems to be based out of Vancouver the same as China not is a very large following in the Sikh community and some of his videos are very explicitly militant violent you know images of them carrying around illegal military equipment and and Russian looking guns rapping about you know wanting to have an independent country ethno state carved out of India so you know these are pretty controversial ideas the some of the images in their music video or even promoting images of individuals who the Indian government considers terrorism terrorists who probably the vast majority of people who are familiar with this issue in this community would consider these individuals to be terrorists and here we have sort of a mainstream Sikh rapper who's paying homage to them promoting them giving it giving it all a platform and and then this individual rapper is also appears to be a close personal friend of jag meet Singh they have several pictures together the rapper endorses him on Instagram calls him his brother and his friends so you know that all of this sort of tangled web of underground extremism in Canada and the connections of these individuals have with very prominent mainstream politicians is finally coming to light that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show no one leaves behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews a day and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
