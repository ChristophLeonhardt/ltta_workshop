PRESIDENT AND HIS ADMINISTRATION. THIS WEEK THE FIRST LADY MELANIA WAS PUT TO THE TEST WITH BIG EVENTS. CHRISTIAN FISHER LOOKS AT HOW SHE IS DOING. IT'S BEEN ONE OF MELANIA'S BUSIEST WEEKS FROM HOSTING THE PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN AND HIS WIFE AT MAR-A-LAGO AND ATTENDING THE FUNERAL OF BARBARA BUSH BY HERSELF AND EXECUTING HER FIRST STATE DINNER. THE FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF TO LAURA BUSH GAVE HER AN A-PLUS. FOR SOMEONE BRAND NEW COMING INTO THIS PROCESS WITHOUT HAVING HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN POLITICS BEFORE, SHE HAS DONE IT CAREFULLY WITH GREAT INTEREST AND RESPECT FOR THE ROLE. FOR A FIRST LADY OF FEWER WORDS THAN MOST PREDECESSORS. MELANIA LETS HER FASHION SPEAK FOR HER. HER HAT SPOKE VOLUMES. IT WAS A STATEMENT, ABSOLUTELY. I AM PROUD TO BE DOING THIS. I AM PROUD TO BE THE FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES. SOMETHING ELSE STOOD OUT TO McBRIDE. THE FIRST LADY ON THE PODIUM WITH THE PRESIDENT. IT'S A POSITION OF STRENGTH. YOU ARE A PARTNER TO THE PRESIDENCY. IN STANDING AT THAT PODIUM CONVEYED THAT. IT ALSO CONVEYED THIS WAS HER EVENT. THE STATE DINNER SHE PLANNED WHITE HOUSE STAFF AND SHE GOT RAVE REVIEWS. FIRST LADY SHINED. SO HELP ME GOD. THE MEDIA PORTRAYS MELANIA AS THE RELUCTANT FIRST LADY. WAITING MONTHS TO MOVE TO WASHINGTON AND WADING INTO THE SPOTLIGHT FOR FEW EVENTS. LIKE THE EASTER EGG EVENT. NOT A CHANCE SHE DID ONE THING TO SET THAT UP. SHE WAS CRITICIZED FOR MAKING CYBER-BULLYING HER SIGNATURE ISSUE. SHE CAN'T CONTROL THAT IN HER OWN HOME. MELANIA IS FINDING HER OWN VOICE. THIS WON'T STOP ME FROM DOING WHAT I KNOW IS RIGHT. KEEP IN MIND THE FIRST LADY STILL HAS NOT ANNOUNCED HER PLATFORM. WHEN SHE DOES, HER SPOKESWOMAN SAID IT WILL INCLUDE CHILDREN'S ISSUES MORE BROADLY.
