1
00:00:11,423 --> 00:00:13,858
>> FOXES WERE FROM THAILAND.

2
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:15,393
SUCCESSFULLY RESCUED IN THE

3
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:20,965
TOTAL DARKNESS.

4
00:00:20,966 --> 00:00:22,867
THE MISSION TO SAVE THE

5
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,669
REMAINING YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,572
SOCCER COACH EXPECTED TO RESUME

7
00:00:27,573 --> 00:00:28,306
LATER TODAY.

8
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:29,407
ARTHEL: THE FOUR BOYS HAVE BEEN

9
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:30,175
TAKEN TO HOSPITAL WHERE THEY ARE

10
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:32,710
RECOVERING FROM A TWO-WEEK

11
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:40,785
APOLOGIST AND CONTRIBUTOR, VERY

12
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:44,522
GLAD TO HAVE YOU HERE TO ANSWER

13
00:00:44,523 --> 00:00:46,991
SOME QUESTIONS I THINK A LOT OF

14
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:47,492
PEOPLE ARE ASKING.

15
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:50,795
WE'LL GET YOU THE EFFECTS OF THE

16
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:51,196
BOYS.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,967
WHAT WILL THEY BE CHECKING FOR

18
00:00:55,968 --> 00:00:56,734
AND WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO

19
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:04,843
IN FOR DEHYDRATION, LOSS OF

20
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:05,910
WEIGHT, OXYGEN LEVELS, ALL OF

21
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,214
WHICH CAN BE CORRECTED VERY

22
00:01:09,215 --> 00:01:09,547
EASILY.

23
00:01:09,548 --> 00:01:10,281
THEY WILL ALSO BE CHECKING FOR

24
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:12,450
INFECTIONS BECAUSE THE THEY

25
00:01:17,923 --> 00:01:19,724
IODINE ON THE SOLES OF SEED

26
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:21,826
BECAUSE THESE KIDS CAN HAVE

27
00:01:21,827 --> 00:01:25,763
BRUISES AND CUTS ON THEIR FEET

28
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:27,732
FROM WALKING IN OTHER PARTS OF

29
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:31,202
THE BODY AND THERE MAY BE BUGS

30
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,270
DOWN THERE THAT ARE MORE

31
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:34,239
INFECTIOUS THAN THE ONES WE ARE

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:34,672
ACCUSTOMED TO.

33
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:38,142
THEY WILL BE CHECKING FOR

34
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:48,419
MOST YOUNG KIDS LIKE THIS WHO'S

35
00:01:51,223 --> 00:01:53,625
CAVE AND APPEAR TO BE ACTING

36
00:01:53,626 --> 00:01:55,326
APPROPRIATELY FROM THE VIDEOS WE

37
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:58,696
HAVE SEEN RESPOND VERY WELL.

38
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:06,271
SUPPORT IN ADDITION TO THEIR

39
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:06,638
FAMILIES.

40
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,806
SO THE OUTLOOK I THINK IS VERY

41
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,647
PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY.

42
00:02:15,648 --> 00:02:16,547
ARTHEL: NOW WE WANT TO TALK

43
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:19,517
ABOUT THE ONE STILL LEFT THERE.

44
00:02:19,518 --> 00:02:22,954
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE OXYGEN

45
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:23,288
LEVELS.

46
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:24,689
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT OVER.

47
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,292
>> KIDS AGED 12 TO 16 FEET LIKE

48
00:02:27,293 --> 00:02:30,628
WEEDS BECAUSE THEY ARE GROWING.

49
00:02:32,498 --> 00:02:34,399
WHAT IS THE IMPACT IS THE

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,167
CRITICAL PART RIGHT NOW.

51
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:38,569
IN THE TRILLION 2010 DISASTER

52
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:43,308
WHERE THEY HAD 33 MINERS CAN

53
00:02:43,309 --> 00:02:48,680
FIND FOR 69 DAYS.

54
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:49,781
THEY WOULD PUT OXYGEN DOWN.

55
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:55,520
WHEN IT GOES BELOW 19%, AND THEY

56
00:02:55,521 --> 00:02:58,222
START TO GET WOOZY BECAUSE THE

57
00:02:58,223 --> 00:02:59,457
BRAIN USES UP ABOUT 25% OF THE

58
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,126
OXYGEN WE ARE BRINGING IN.

59
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:02,827
THE LOWER OXYGEN IS THE BRAIN

60
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:05,396
THAT GETS IT.

61
00:03:05,397 --> 00:03:09,300
IF IT GETS DOWN TO 15%, WHICH IS

62
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,669
WHAT THEY ARE STATED SO FAR IN

63
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,537
THE ENVIRONMENT, THE PERSON CAN

64
00:03:12,538 --> 00:03:18,109
BECOME VERY DISORIENTED AND

65
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,145
UNABLE TO MOVE PROPERLY WHICH IS

66
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:21,846
INCREASINGLY MORE IMPORTANT TO

67
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,747
RESCUE THEM.

68
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:25,483
AND IF IT GETS BELOW 10%, DEATH

69
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:28,987
CAN OCCUR WITHIN CONSCIOUSNESS,

70
00:03:28,988 --> 00:03:29,687
CONVULSIONS ALL BECAUSE OF THE

71
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:34,892
LACK OF OXYGEN.

72
00:03:34,893 --> 00:03:36,761
THEY COULDN'T DO IT THE WAY THEY

73
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:41,165
DID IT, AND THE OXYGEN IS JUST

74
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:45,236
BEING USED UP.

75
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:45,870
>> IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING

76
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:46,604
BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A NARROW

77
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,311
BRING IN OXYGEN TANKS FOR

78
00:03:53,312 --> 00:03:57,382
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

79
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:58,116
>> THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY.

80
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:01,452
ARTHEL: GIVEN THOSE MADE FOR

81
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,354
HIRE OXYGEN LEVELS, HOW MUCH

82
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,623
TIME DO THEY HAVE COME INTO THE

83
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:08,993
RESCUERS HAVE TWO GET THE VOICE

84
00:04:08,994 --> 00:04:09,827
TO SAFETY WITHOUT DAMAGE TO

85
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:12,430
THEIR BRAIN.

86
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,165
MATZO PHYSICAL AS WELL AS

87
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,133
EMOTIONAL.

88
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:19,404
THAT IS TRICKY.

89
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:22,273
THEY SAID THEY BEEN ABLE TO

90
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,647
NOW IT'S RAINING AND THEY CAN'T

91
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:31,449
STOP WATER FROM COMING IN FROM

92
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,951
ALL DIFFERENT SIDES AND RAISING

93
00:04:33,952 --> 00:04:34,385
THE LEVELS.

94
00:04:34,386 --> 00:04:35,153
THEY HAVE JUST A FEW DAYS TO BE

95
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:39,891
ABLE TO GET AROUND SAFELY.

96
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:49,434
IF IT WILL WORK.

97
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,369
IT IS 11 TO 16-YEAR-OLD IN THE

98
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,272
11-YEAR-OLDS ARE IN THE MOST

99
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:54,705
JEOPARDY.

100
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:55,440
>> WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE

101
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:57,742
GUYS LEFT BEHIND IN TERMS OF

102
00:04:57,743 --> 00:04:58,676
FINDING OUT THAT THEY'RE A TEAM

103
00:04:58,677 --> 00:05:01,879
THAT'S COMING IN AND OUT SAFELY.

104
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,881
>> THAT IS A HUGE LIFT IN THE

105
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:07,685
COMMUNICATIONS IS A HUGE LIFT

106
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:09,353
AND THAT MEANS THEY CAN DO IT.

107
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:09,987
SO THAT'S A GREAT IMPACT.

108
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:13,524
THE EMOTIONAL TOLL, LOOKS LIKE

109
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:16,594
THE SCOUT, THE GUY IN CHARGE HAS

110
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:17,328
HANDLED THEM VERY NICELY WHILE

111
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:20,164
THEY WERE CONFINED FOR 10 DAYS

112
00:05:20,165 --> 00:05:23,634
UNTIL THEY WERE RESCUED.

113
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:28,506
HE ALSO IS THE ONE WHO'S MOST AT

114
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:32,276
RISK FOR EMOTIONAL ISSUES AND

115
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:32,577
PTSD.

116
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:33,644
ARTHEL: BECAUSE HE ALSO BROUGHT

117
00:05:33,645 --> 00:05:37,815
THEM THERE.

118
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:38,616
>> AND IS APPARENTLY GIVEN OVER

119
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:39,450
A LOT OF THIS FOOD AND THINGS TO

120
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:43,387
SAID YOU THINK THEY GOT THE

121
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:44,388
STRONGER BOYS OUT FIRST TO SEE

122
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,525
IF IT WORKS.

123
00:05:47,526 --> 00:05:48,292
IS THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE STRONG

124
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,566
>> STRONG ENOUGH NOT TO PANIC.

125
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,307
START PANICKING, EVEN THOUGH YOU

126
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:04,876
HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN IN YOU.

127
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:08,980
THAT IS WHY PEOPLE DROWN IN THE

128
00:06:08,981 --> 00:06:09,547
OPENING.

129
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,616
PEOPLE WHO SUDDENLY CAN'T SWIM

130
00:06:11,617 --> 00:06:13,251
QUITE WELL AND THEY PANIC WHEN

131
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:16,988
THE RESCUERS COME AND THEY CAN

132
00:06:16,989 --> 00:06:17,588
PULL THE RESCUERS DOWN.

133
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:21,325
IT WOULD PUT THE DIAPERS AT RISK

134
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:21,626
ALSO.

135
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:23,694
THEY START PANICKING BECAUSE AT

136
00:06:23,695 --> 00:06:28,199
A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN THE MASK

137
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,535
ISN'T WORKING WHEN THEY ARE

138
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:31,235
SQUEEZING THROUGH A PASSAGE OR

139
00:06:31,236 --> 00:06:31,602
SOMETHING.

140
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:32,904
IT IS A DANGER FOR BOTH THE KIDS

141
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:35,873
IN THE RESCUERS.

142
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:36,941
ARTHEL: ANYTHING WE HAVE A NASTY

143
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:38,643
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO POINT

144
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:38,976
OUT?

145
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:42,146
>> JUST THE APPRECIATION COME IN

146
00:06:42,147 --> 00:06:42,780
THE IMPORTANCE OF OXYGEN.

147
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:45,750
WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED BECAUSE

148
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:46,284
THEY'VE GOT 21%.

149
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:50,821
IF IT GOES LOWER THAN NOT, THE

150
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:54,926
PERSON GETS CONFUSED,

151
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,928
HALLUCINATING AND DOESN'T

152
00:06:56,929 --> 00:07:00,164
FUNCTION IN A WAY THAT'S

153
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,199
HELPFUL.

154
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,867
>> STILL LIKE ALL OF US FROM A

155
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:04,535
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

156
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:05,469
YOU REMAIN HOPEFUL.

157
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,204
>> HOPEFULLY ONCE THEY GET OUT

158
00:07:06,205 --> 00:00:00,000
THOUGH BE PHYSICALLY OKAY.
