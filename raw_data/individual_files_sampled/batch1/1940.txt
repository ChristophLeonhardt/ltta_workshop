Cavanaugh's traffic can be a nightmare and often the pollution levels exceed that of larger cities like New Delhi and Beijing in order to manage pollution in accidents in the past governments started enforcing an old decision to ban public vehicles that are more than twenty years old last year public vehicles alone were responsible for more than 7,000 major and minor accidents in the Kathmandu Valley twenty old vehicles were banned from the city two years ago but the ban has now been imposed across the country according to the Department of Transportation as many as 16,000 vehicles will be taken off the roads because of this decision just a few hours outside Kathmandu in Bank village there are few buses transferring locals drivers here are happy that the ban has just come into effect it's tended us to run all buses on these roads brakes and steering can fail and there can be accident but vehicles older than 20 years - even 30 years are is still operating around here but the decision has upset some transport entrepreneurs were often accused of acting like cartels just last month the government ended their monopoly on bus routes and allowed new buses now the entrepreneurs say this 20-year ban will impact rural areas the most operating in the Hills they cost 100 to 150 thousand dollars now I can't replace those vehicles and people will be deprived of the services if vehicles are damaged even within five to ten years they should be removed from operation capping the life of vehicles to 20 years is unscientific Nepal ease pay high rates of taxes to import new vehicles up to two hundred and eighty eight percent government officials say it takes no longer than twelve years to recover the investment on public transport and extra eight years is profit transport entrepreneurs say they already run at a loss and once subsidies to buy new vehicles now they are threatening to go on an extended strike but government officials say they are not going to back down is when the government cook the government so far has only a regulatory and managerial role in the public rotation sector we need to operate our own public transportation system like the metropolitan cities in developed countries we are lobbying and hope to demonstrate this all over the country the ban of all vehicles might not have much impact on Katmandu pollution but if both sides don't compromise and vehicles are not replaced on rural roads the poorest people in the country may have less access to public transport it's been a treasure al Jazeera that might do
