let's get the thoughts now with George Galloway he's a British author broadcaster and former MP - and he joins us now and you're very welcome George thanks for coming onto our tea tonight to discuss this we're hearing there just take more ads report for example more and more people are coming forward saying look we live there but we saw no evidence of a chemical attack but this line is not even discussed by Western leaders or in the Western media it's just totally dismissed well amid four miserable viewing I must say not because of the witnesses and their valuable testimony but the conduct of people who call themselves journalists people who pass for the Fourth Estate which is supposed to ask difficult questions of everybody in a story but they have become absorbed like a kind of Stockholm Syndrome in bedded with the states in which they work and the collection of states that is in play here and that's the reason for the kind of frenzy the kind of bitter cynicism that they displayed and I was embarrassed to watch it because most of the worst offenders were British thank God you cannot bribe or twist the average British journalist but when you see what unbridle do you see that there's no reason to and that was in full and ugly view to anyone watching that press conference it also makes you think George doesn't it what evidence has to be presented for them just to perhaps reconsider their position not necessarily change their opinion in the end but just to at least say okay let's have another look well how did they form their opinion they formed from afar either in newsrooms or Studios they've never been in Syria they don't know any Arabic they've never heard of Duma until it became a war zone they were told which we they should be facing long time ago in this conflict and they've never stopped to ask themselves how is it that we ended up on the side of the jihadists the army of Islam these are not people normally given to flying flags for the army of Islam but they're ready to fly the flags of the whole alphabet soup of these Islamist fanatic formations that are operating in Syria it's at one of the same time ridiculous but also obscene and when real journalists went there like Robert Fisk the multiply awarded British journalist of the year more times than I can remember when he went there on his own feet walked around without a minder without a guard nothing just him and his notebook and pencil and told them there was no chemical attack in Douma well it is as if he'd never existed as if they'd never heard of him Robert who they might as well have been asking George good2talk shave sorry we've run out of time but we'll leave it there for now that was George Galloway British author broadcaster and former MP thank you
