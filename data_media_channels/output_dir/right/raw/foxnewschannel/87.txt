PRESIDENT OF FLESHER NEWS.

22
00:01:53,856 --> 00:01:54,522
BRET CAVANAGH, IS IT OVER?

23
00:01:54,523 --> 00:01:56,257
HE'S CONFIRMED, BUT I DON'T

24
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:56,758
THINK IT'S OVER.

25
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,193
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

26
00:01:58,194 --> 00:01:59,127
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE

27
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:00,895
IN THE COUNTRY POLITICALLY IN

28
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:04,032
TERMS OF PARTIES AND CULTURE.

29
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:09,037
IT SEEMS TO ME THIS WAS A BIG

30
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:14,742
EVENT.

31
00:02:14,743 --> 00:02:18,913
WE HIT A NEW LOW AND THINGS

32
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:32,560
GOT PERSONAL AND SO NASTY.

33
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:37,999
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FIVE

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,733
PEOPLE MADE SEXUAL ACCUSATIONS

35
00:02:38,734 --> 00:02:39,534
AGAINST HIM AND THEN THE MEDIA

36
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,337
PUT THEM ALL ON THE AIR

37
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:44,239
UNFILTERED AND IT JUST FELL

38
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:52,847
APART ON HIS OWN.

39
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:53,915
WHEN YOU MAKE IT ABOUT A MAN

40
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:56,317
BEING A RAPIST, THAT'S A NEW

41
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:56,651
LOW.

42
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:57,352
>> PREVIOUSLY, I AGREE WITH

43
00:02:57,353 --> 00:03:02,824
YOU, IT MAY HAVE BEEN ABOUT

44
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:03,491
CONSERVATIVE PHILOSOPHY OR

45
00:03:03,492 --> 00:03:04,692
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR

46
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:08,596
INAPPROPRIATE COMMENTS, THIS

47
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:13,568
WAS --DASH, THIS WAS ABOUT AN

48
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,235
ACCUSATION THAT WOULD LAND

49
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,738
ANYONE IN JAIL FOR 25 YEARS,

50
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,240
AND THAT IS A NEW LOW.

51
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,475
IN THE END, HE IS GOING TO

52
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:26,481
HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT MCAFEE

53
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:27,749
WAS ALSO A NEW LOW IN TERMS OF

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,750
THE TRIBALISM THAT WE SEE IN

55
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,717
PLAY, YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE

56
00:03:29,718 --> 00:03:32,921
PART OF A POLITICAL PARTY, BUT

57
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:33,755
WHEN SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE IS

58
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:34,422
HAPPENING, YOU WOULD HOPE

59
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,591
THERE WOULD BE MEN AND WOMEN

60
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:37,759
OF VIRTUE WHO STAND UP AND SAY

61
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,863
THIS IS RIDICULOUS, THIS CAN'T

62
00:03:41,864 --> 00:03:43,097
GO ON, AND SO THAT WAS WORSE

63
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,065
THAN WE SAW IN THE CLARENCE

64
00:03:44,066 --> 00:03:44,599
THOMAS HEARINGS.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,701
>> I HAVE TO SAY, WHEN I LOOK

66
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:47,535
ACROSS THE AISLE OF THE

67
00:03:47,536 --> 00:03:48,369
DEMOCRATIC PARTY, I CANNOT

68
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,470
FIND A SINGLE PERSON THAT I

69
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:50,138
THOUGHT WAS BEING ANYTHING

70
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:51,372
OTHER THAN FUNDAMENTALLY

71
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:56,110
UNFAIR AND OFTEN INCREDIBLY

72
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:56,811
DISHONEST, OBVIOUSLY DONALD

73
00:03:56,812 --> 00:04:00,915
TRUMP WON THIS FIGHT, BUT THE

74
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:01,816
OTHER PERSON WHO CAME OUT A

75
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:04,652
WINNER IS CHUCK SCHUMER

76
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,588
BECAUSE GOING BACK TO THOSE

77
00:04:06,589 --> 00:04:08,923
BUSH NOMINEES, CHUCK SCHUMER

78
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:09,691
MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO

79
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:13,061
TURN THE JUDICIARY INTO A NEW

80
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:16,664
IDEOLOGICAL ATTITUDE AND HE

81
00:04:16,665 --> 00:04:17,265
SUCCEEDED IN DOING THAT.

82
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:17,799
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW.

83
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,334
WE SAW AN IDEOLOGICAL,

84
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:23,338
POLITICAL FIGHT OVER A

85
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:26,407
NOMINEE, OVER A POSITION

86
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,176
THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED BE

87
00:04:28,177 --> 00:04:28,743
IDEOLOGICAL FOR.

88
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,312
>> I HAVE THIS THOUGHT, I'VE

89
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,014
BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS A LOT,

90
00:04:33,015 --> 00:04:36,951
AND THAT IS WHEN THE FIRST TWO

91
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:40,788
WERE TALKING ABOUT CLEARANCE,

92
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,523
WHO SAID

93
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:42,557
WHO SITD

94
00:04:42,558 --> 00:04:43,124
WHO SITS ON THE COURT,

95
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,726
BOB WAS OFFERED TEACHING

96
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,894
PHYSICIANS AT DIFFERENT LAW

97
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:47,228
SCHOOLS.

98
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,731
NOT SO WITH CAVANAGH, RIGHT,

99
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:53,234
HE'S NOT INVITED BACK TO

100
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:53,968
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL TO TEACH.

101
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:54,702
THAT YALE FACULTY, WHICH WHEN

102
00:04:54,703 --> 00:05:01,042
HE WAS ANNOUNCED EMBRACED

103
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:06,247
HIM.

104
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,015
PEOPLE JUST KEPT SAYING THIS

105
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:14,489
IS A JOB INTERVIEW.

106
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,290
A MAN'S ENTIRE LIFE AND

107
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,091
REPUTATION AND NAME AND HONOR

108
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:21,562
WERE BEING DESTROYED.

109
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:22,664
THAT'S WHY YOU SAW A LOT OF

110
00:05:22,665 --> 00:05:25,133
WOMEN REACT NEGATIVELY WHO

111
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:28,136
CARE AND LOVE ABOUT THE MEN IN

112
00:05:28,137 --> 00:05:30,571
OUR LIVES AND TO SEE HOW

113
00:05:30,572 --> 00:05:34,075
QUICKLY THAT CAN BE DESTROYED

114
00:05:34,076 --> 00:05:37,078
BY THINKING THROUGH.

115
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:37,812
>> YOU SAID SOMETHING EARLIER

116
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:38,479
ABOUT PEOPLE OF VIRTUE AND

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,213
THIS WAS A MOMENT THAT TESTED

118
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,815
PEOPLE OF VIRTUE AND HOW THEY

119
00:05:40,816 --> 00:05:52,360
ACT.

120
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,161
WE THOUGHT HOW DIANE FEINSTEIN

121
00:05:53,162 --> 00:05:53,828
HANDLED THE INITIAL CLAIM.

122
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:54,562
PUT ASIDE FOR A SECOND WHETHER

123
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,464
SHE SHOULD HAVE RELEASED HER

124
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:57,398
EARLIER OR HELD THAT LATER,

125
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,299
THE VIRTUOUS THING TO DO WOULD

126
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,035
HAVE BEEN TO SAY THIS IS A

127
00:06:01,036 --> 00:06:02,437
SERIOUS ALLEGATION, A TEST OF

128
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:04,872
THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND

129
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:07,108
ALSO A WOMAN WHO WANTS

130
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:07,442
PRIVACY.

131
00:06:07,443 --> 00:06:13,014
I MUST, FROM A MORAL POINT OF

132
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:14,749
VIEW, YOU MUST DEAL WITH THIS

133
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,484
PRIVATELY AND IMMEDIATELY AND

134
00:06:16,485 --> 00:06:28,629
SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.

135
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,997
>> SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO

136
00:06:29,998 --> 00:06:32,767
RE-CREATE THE WHEEL HERE.

137
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:35,903
THERE WERE WAYS TO DEAL WITH

138
00:06:35,904 --> 00:06:36,337
THE ISSUES.

139
00:06:36,338 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY COULD'VE DONE IT QUIETLY,
