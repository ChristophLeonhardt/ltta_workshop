A CAMPAIGN.
THE CHIEF OF THAT IS RUNNING FOR
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
MOLLIE, THANKS VERY MUCH.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Neil: AND HE'S IS PRESIDENT
NOW AND NOW HE'S TALKING TRADE
WERE THE CHINESE.
THE PRESIDENT WILL MEET WITH THE
HEAD DELEGATION FROM CHINA.
AHEAD OF THAT, HE HAD A LOT TO
SAY ON IT.
TAKE A LOOK.
>> HAVE YOU EVER EVEN SEEN A
NEGOTIATING IN TRADE?
NOBODY HAS EVER SEEN OUR COUNTRY
NEGOTIATE ON TRADE.
TRADE WITH CHINA AND WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES.
I'M NOT JUST BLAMING CHINA.
CHINA IS THE BIGGEST.
BUT TRADE IS A TOTAL ONE-WAY
STREET.
>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
OHIO REPUBLICAN SENATOR ROB
PORTMAN HERE.
HE'S A MEMBER OF THE SENATE
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.
SENATOR ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE, SIR, OF THESE
LATEST DEVELOPMENTS ON THE TRADE
FRONT, YOU KNOW, SOME DIVISION
WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE WE'RE
TOLD AMONG GOING REALLY TOUGH,
SORT OF THE NAVARRO ROUTE OR
MAINSTREAM MNUCHIN ROUTE?
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> I THINK THE PRESIDENT IS
RIGHT TO FOCUS ON CHINA.
HE'S RIGHT TO SAY THAT THE
IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND
CHINA HAS GROWN OVER TIME.
AND BY THE WAY, OF THE $500
BILLION TRADE DEFICIT WE HAVE,
$370 BILLION IS WITH CHINA.
SO NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HE'S
FOCUSED ON WAS INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY.
THE FACT THAT THEY TAKE OUR
SECRETS AND USE THEM.
SO IT'S REAL AND IT'S GOOD THAT
HE IS FINALLY SORT OF STANDING
UP TO IT.
NOT FINALLY HIM BUT FINALLY AN
AMERICAN ADMINISTRATION IS DOING
THAT.
BUT NEIL, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
HOW YOU DO IT.
>> Neil: IN DOING SO, SENATOR,
HE'S WILLING TO OFFER AN OLIVE
BRANCH TO ZTE WHO HAS BEEN
STEALING SECRETS, DOING ALL THE
THINGS YOU JUST MENTIONED IN
ORDER TO EXTRACT A TRADE DEAL.
IT DOES SEEM WEIRD.
>> IT DOES SEEM WEIRD.
BECAUSE ZTE IS A COMPANY THAT
MAKES PHONES AND EVEN THE FBI
DIRECTOR, WRAY, THE NEW
DIRECTOR, TESTIFIED THIS WEEK
THAT HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT
COUNTRIES THAT DON'T SHARE OUR
VALUES HAVING COMPANIES HERE IN
THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK.
SO THAT IS SORT OF INCONSISTENT
WITH WHAT I THINK WE'RE TRYING
TO DO WITH CHINA, WHICH IS TO
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE RECIPROCITY
AND A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD
WHICH WOULD INCLUDE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER
SOPHISTICATED KINDS OF
TECHNOLOGY.
I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE.
IF YOU GO TOO FAR, WHAT SOME
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, YOU MENTIONED
STEVE MNUCHIN, YOU WILL END UP
SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IF
YOU DO IN FACT HAVE THE CHINESE
RETAILATING AGAINST OUR
PROPERTIES AND WATER NOT GETTING
MORE ENTRY INTO THEIR MARKETS.
WE HAVE A BIGGER MARKET.
WE HAVE THE TRADE DEFICIT.
IN OTHER WORDS, ONLY SO MUCH
THEY CAN DO TO HURT OUR TRADE
BECAUSE THEY'RE SELLING US MORE
THAN WE'RE SELLING THEM.
>> Neil: BUT WHAT -- THE
PRESIDENT IS MEETING WITH CHINA
RIGHT NOW.
THE VICE PREMIER THIS HOUR.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS COME
UP IS THIS HOW FAR DO WE PUSH
THE CHINESE?
PETER NAVARRO IS SAYING WE PUSH
THEM A LOT AND WE DO DO ANYTHING
WITH COMPANIES LIKE ZTE.
MNUCHIN, THE TREASURY SECRETARY,
SEEMS TO BE PART OF THAT MORE
TRADITIONAL APPROACH
INCREMENTALLY WE GET CONCESSIONS
FROM THEM.
EVEN IF IT MEANS MAKING A DEAL
ON ZTE, THE END JUSTIFY THE
MEANS.
WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS?
>> YEAH, FIRST OF ALL, ZTE IS A
SEPARATE ISSUE.
IT'S A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE.
>> Neil: I KNOW THAT.
THE PRESIDENT HAS LINKED IT.
>> THAT'S WHY -- YOU USED THE
WORD "WEIRD."
THESE A GOOD WAY TO PUT IT.
IT DOESN'T CONNECT WITH THE
TRADE ISSUE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT ZTE IS HANDLED
ON MERITS.
LET'S SAY THERE'S A NATIONAL
SECURITY CONCERN FROM WHAT WE
KNOW AND WHAT DIRECTOR WRAY
SAID.
BUT WITH REGARD TO TRADE,
THERE'S A BIG MIDDLE GROUND
HERE.
WITH REGARD TO CHINA, WE'RE
LOOKING FOR A LEVEL PLAYING
FIELD.
ORGANIZATION.
YOU HAVE TO LIVE BUT THEIR
RULES.
ONE OF THE ISSUES OF INVESTMENT,
THE CHINESE REQUIRE THERE'S
CHINESE OWNERSHIP.
THAT'S ONE THING THE PRESIDENT
HAS FOCUSED ON APPROPRIATELY.
ONE OF THE ISSUES, THE CHINESE,
51% OWNERS TAKE THE INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY AND USE IT FOR ANOTHER
CHINESE COMPANY OR OTHERWISE
HAVE IT BE USED ON THE CHINESE
SIDE.
>> Neil: IT CAN BE MURKY.
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.
>> THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO GO
INTO.
THERE'S A BILL MIDDLE GROUND
