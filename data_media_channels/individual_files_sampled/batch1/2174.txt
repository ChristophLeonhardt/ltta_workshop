I've learned so many lessons launching Skinnygirl which is why I wrote a book called I suck at relationships so you don't have to because in my business life I've learned way more from my mistakes to ultimately achieve success so I've made so many mistakes I have checked off the wrong box in a way to be paid and I think I checked I had to be an S corp vs an LLC or vice versa and it ended up costing me millions of dollars things that you do that are just a little checking off of a box can later really really burn you it's a lot of it's about when I back when I didn't have any money and I couldn't really afford to have the legal that I should have been able to afford so you better be able to read your own contracts but by the same token I've made a lot of great decisions I decided season one of housewife when I got paid seven thousand two hundred and fifty dollars for the entire season my only thing I wanted my contract was that everything I did in my work was mine I was like Tina Turner I own everything I just want my name and when I ended up selling the small portion of skinny girl that is cocktails that ended up being a very good decision and they created the Bethenny clause which is what all agents make their clients sign because anyone who signs on to reality television has to give a portion of their business to the man except for me I was grandfathered in because i am the bethany clause
