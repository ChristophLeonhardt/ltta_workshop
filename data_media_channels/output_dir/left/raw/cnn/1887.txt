1
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:08,610
president Trump announcing that more
troops will be going to Afghanistan this

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,420
is a major shift from his physician
before taking office when he felt the US

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,900
should immediately get out of
Afghanistan so how do the president's

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,039
most passionate supporters feel about
this change and other recent news events

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,480
i sat down with a group of Trump voters
from Florida Pennsylvania Michigan

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,160
Alabama and Georgia some of whom even
volunteered for his campaign to see how

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,920
they feel today and to get the pulse of
the people the president is going to

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,309
increase troop levels in Afghanistan
show of hands who's comfortable with

9
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,890
that everybody would like to see troop
levels go up in Afghanistan tell me why

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,670
Bobby I think it's a serious problem
that we've kind of not taken that

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,390
seriously in the last eight years of
Obama and this is this is what he this

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,300
is what he said he was going to do that
he was going to but no he didn't when

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,280
President Obama was increasing troop
levels President Trump and Donald Trump

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,769
tweeted we should get out this is silly
we should rebuild the US we should leave

15
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,220
Afghanistan immediately we have wasted
an enormous amount of blood and treasure

16
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,700
in Afghanistan he wanted to get out and
how many generals that he talked to

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,070
before he tweeted none now you know

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:23,460
mentally he didn't have the information
as I was reading them YC mm I really

19
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,450
feel we don't have a plan yeah then he
didn't know what he was talking about no

20
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:32,430
he did not have their annua any
narration has today which is completely

21
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,530
different
we have generals and military experts we

22
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,159
have to trust what they said Obama knows
within that to them in Iraq we may not

23
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
be here with Isis President Obama had
way more troops over and Donald Trump at

24
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,479
the time didn't like that but he's
trying to end it so does the general

25
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,530
said seven four thousand over we will
try and end it and don't you think the

26
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,329
President Obama was trying to end it no
no it was suddenly pulled up and so the

27
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,380
President Obama had a surge as well
right so he was trying to do the right

28
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,649
thing as well Organa Stan yes 2011 so
now President Trump will be trying and

29
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,979
you had a lot of military people saying
that Obama didn't listen to them that he

30
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,560
was telling that they were talking to
him and he was just ignore commanders

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,170
you know a lot of military generals and
people that came out saying that he was

32
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,100
not
it's time for I'm just trying to

33
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:19,660
understand the consistency of it's bad
when President Obama does it it's good

34
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,470
when president Truong all it's only that
we have generals there military experts

35
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,050
we have to trust what they say they know
what they're telling about if you're

36
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,900
signing their pro right way we're behind
all of it okay North Korea go ahead tell

37
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,850
us what's funny
kibou what are we waiting for no I like

38
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,720
the way he's handling called North Korea
and how is he handling judge Estrada he

39
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,020
has to be tough because he's always
craziness and I think that I think it's

40
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,730
a matter chief that he's been a lot more
disciplined if he can do it everywhere

41
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:55,570
else and you know it's almost chilling
there was a video of President Trump

42
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,710
being interviewed on a civilian son
Donald Trump in 1999 and he was asked

43
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,680
about North Korea and he said what are
we going to do wait for them to have

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,010
missiles pointed at us before we act
before we do anything we and look at the

45
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,670
situation now look where their nuclear
program has escalated to and so I think

46
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,850
that Kim jong-un has run around
unchecked in that part of the world for

47
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:18,340
a long time some people you hear talking
about president Trump's mental

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,020
instabilities congresswoman Jackie
Speier let me read to you her tweet the

49
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,130
president is showing signs of erratic
behavior and mental instability that

50
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,989
plates the country in grave danger time
to invoke the 25th amendment what she's

51
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,300
looking for okay whatever is President
Trump is smarter than anybody in this

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,640
room amen he has made millions of
dollars he knows what he's doing and if

53
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,110
the her think he's mentally what is in
the world why would you think that guy's

54
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,510
middle he ain't mental you know he had
two choices Hillary in him and if

55
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,780
Hillary was the president right now what
he's going to be going on North Korea

56
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,930
what do you think the stock market would
be doing what do you think would be

57
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,140
going on in North Korea that guy would
probably have already done sir I know

58
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,500
the stock market when the gauntlet run
since the world's biggest troll

59
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,870
everybody everybody falls for it every
day hook line and sinker he's just he

60
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:15,730
loves controlling a narrative you know
he's trying to be a very public enemy

61
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,029
number one let's be honest okay
Republicans hate him and Democrats hate

62
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:22,840
him you don't want to hate him because
he threatens their existence again the

63
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,570
dollars returned to the country this was
they asked for decimal because that's

64
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,570
progressive the media that's one to me
to chew on and make everybody go

65
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,720
hysterical while he's there actually
getting things done I don't find his

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,540
Twitter productive to be honest I think
it draws away from what could be a

67
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,390
really positive message coming out of
his administration they have

68
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,080
accomplished so much in terms of the
economy you know the stock market's up

69
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,190
around 18% unemployment down to around
4.2 percent which is the lowest since

70
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,510
2002 nearly 20 years I wish he would
tone down the Twitter a little bit so we

71
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,870
could focus on what his administration
is accomplished Robert what do you think

72
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,500
Twitter is an effective means for him to
communicate directly with all his

73
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,250
supporters bypassing the media getting
his message directly out what about the

74
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:06,000
Republicans like senator Tim Scott like
people who are now speaking out saying

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,340
that they think that the president sort
of doesn't have the stability the moral

76
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,470
authority is what senator Tim Scott said
be a leader they think if I do this now

77
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,730
that they get reelected if you don't
know the truth that's why I voted for

78
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:24,960
Trump I'm for business and they blame
their stuff civil rights man I went

79
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,240
through civil rights in 16 Alabama this
ain't nothing you know a bad guy 100 200

80
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,440
people up there and everybody blowing it
up and those people don't represent you

81
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,610
and me and all other ones don't
represent Hillary and if Hillary was

82
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,880
president there would still be
protesting the ticking down of the

83
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,700
statue there would still be white
supremacy on wherever and it would still

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,200
be not that you know what for eight
years

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,000
we heard Obama say that we can't we
can't refer to terrorists as Islamic

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,570
radical terrorists because it empowers
them increase their numbers but for

87
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:58,290
eight months I've heard the left call
Trump supporters white supremacist and

88
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:01,320
Nazis with no fear at all that's going
to increase their numbers or empower

89
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,370
them but the analogy there is that with
President Trump was so angry that

90
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,280
President Obama wouldn't call it for
what President Trump bought it was

91
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,660
radical Islamic terror why didn't he
admit a callout neo-nazi why didn't he

92
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,680
call it what it is if staying radical
Islamic terrorists empowers the

93
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,760
terrorists and increase their numbers
then why calling us white supremacist

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,880
and Nazis doesn't increase their numbers
or empower them how do you know it

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,590
doesn't empower them then why don't you
stop saying it

96
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:35,550
power is more logic year hold on your
circular logic is confusing if president

97
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,170
trama wants evil to be called out why
didn't he call neo-nazis by name at

98
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:43,920
first he didn't have all the facts he
didn't note about the thousand doesn't

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:00:00,000
generally not a psychic it just happened
