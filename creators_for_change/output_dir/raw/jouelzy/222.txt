does not come through silence or total

105
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,840
unity I want us to understand that we do

106
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
not all have to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how to proceed</font>

107
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,240
forward but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> simply have to find a way</font>

108
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and an act that whether it comes to you</font>

109
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,779
being a citizen of awareness whether it

110
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,029
comes from you triumphing the rights of

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,009
whether it comes from your knowledge

however you can share and be impactful

115
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,199
be impactful the resources that you have

116
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,379
available to you because change will

117
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,810
only come through pressure and hopefully

118
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:15,629
we can get the change to impact before

119
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:18,960
that pressure point entirely combust<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

120
