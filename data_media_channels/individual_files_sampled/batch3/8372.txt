President Trump: THANK YOU AS WELL TO OUR DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN FOR BEING HERE. FLEW DOWN TOGETHER. PRESS WANTS TO KNOW, WHY DIDN'T YOU TALK ABOUT IT? WE HAD A VERY GOOD TALKER, I WILL SAY. IT BECAME A VERY BIG STORY ACTUALLY, FOLKS. WE HAD A GOOD TALK. Laura: BOY DID THAT KEEP PEOPLE GUESSING. THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP SURPRISING A LOT OF FOLKS WITH HIS NEW FOUND SUPPORT FOR DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL ROD ROSENSTEIN. THE MAN OVERSEEING THE ROBERT RB THE MAN OVERSEEING THE ROBERT RR THE MAN OVERSEEING THE ROBERT RT MUELLER PROBE. DEVON NUNEZ IS HERE TONIGHT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL TODAY? THAT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK ANY OF US THINK THAT ROSENSTEIN SHOULD BE DISMISSED BEFORE THE ELECTION. I THINK HE DOES HAVE TO COME IN THIS WEEK AND ANSWER WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS WILLING TO WEAR A CHOIR OR NOT AND WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS LOOKING AT INVOKING THE 25TH AMENDMENT. THOSE ARE KEY QUESTIONS THAT HE WILL ANSWER BEFORE THE RUSSIA TASK FORCE THIS WEEK SUPPOSEDLY ON THURSDAY. Laura: THE ISSUE OF THIS REDACTED SERIES OF DOCUMENTS REGARDING THE RUSSIA PROBE, PEOPLE WATCHING ACROSS THE COUNTRY, SAYING OKAY, YOU GUYS ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THIS. DOCUMENTS THAT ARE DECLASSIFIED OR THEY ARE NOT WERE PARTIALLY DECLASSIFIED. THE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL WITH A FEW OTHERS FROM THE INTEL COMMUNITY CONVINCED THE PRESIDENT, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, NOT TO DECLASSIFY DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE FIRES OUT WARRANT AGAINST CARTER PAGE AND OTHERS. AND IT KICKED IT OVER TO THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. CORRECT? WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW ABOUT THIS? THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT'S REALLY MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE FBI. EVERY TIME I TRY TO GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE PUBLIC, THEY CRY WOLF. THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY CLEAR AND SAID THAT THESE DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE IMMEDIATELY DECLASSIFIED, WITHOUT REDUCTIONS. THEN SUDDENLY, THE IG WAS BROUGHT IN. NOW MY CHALLENGE WITH AGAINST THE IG, THE IDEA IS PROBABLY A GREAT GUY BUT WE ARE CONGRESS AND WE BELIEVE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW THIS INFORMATION. IT NEEDS TO BE MADE PUBLIC, NOT MUCH INFORMATION. BUT WE WANT THE PRESIDENT TO BE CLASSIFIED AND THE PRESIDENT HAS MENTIONED HE WOULD. SO IT'S NOW BEEN TWO AND A HALF OR THREE WEEKS AND IT DOESN'T TAKE THAT LONG. YOU ARE ONLY TALKING ABOUT 20 PAGES OF FISA AND I THINK ABOUT A DOZEN OR SO OTHER REPORTS, AN AND, I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THINKING HERE. THE PRESIDENT I THINK IT IS A SMART GUY, AND I THINK HE NEEDS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO HE LISTENS TO. Laura: WHILE ADAM SCHIFF IS ALL OVER THIS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE. LET'S WATCH. THE SINGLE ACT OF USING A NEVER BEFORE HOUSE RULE TO SELECTIVELY RELEASE CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IN THE NOW NUNEZ MEMORANDUM, AND IT WAS A FRAUDULENT ONE AT THAT. HE'S HONESTLY NOT TALKING ABOUT A PARTICULAR ISSUE BUT, BUT MAKING A PERSONAL ABOUT YOU, YOU KNOW YOU ARE USED TO THIS AND RUNNING FOR REELECTION, AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU OUT BE TO BE THE BOGEYMAN YOU OUT BE TO BE THE BOGEYMAH YOU OUT BE TO BE THE BOGEYMAR YOU OUT BE TO BE THE BOGEYMAE BUT AT THIS POINT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT AMERICANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY AN AMERICAN CITIZEN WAS SPIED UPON USING DOCUMENTS THAT WE ARE CREATED AT THE FUNDING OF THE PRESIDENT'S OPPONENTS DURING THE CAMPAIGN. THE ENTIRE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THE FRIENDS OF THE MEDIA WHICH IS PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEM, EXCEPT FOR 10%, AND ALL THE BAD PEOPLE FROM THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WERE FUMBLING THIS STUFF IN THE FBI. THEY HAVE A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THE FBI AND DOJ THAT ARE GONE. WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC KNEW THAT THIS INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SOMEBODY WAS DOING TO BASICALLY SET UP A CAMPAIGN AND ACCUSE THEM OF POLLUTING WITH RUSSIANS WAS REALLY WRONG. WE ARE PROVING THAT ONLY COLLISION THAT HAPPENED WAS COLLISION WITH THE DEMOCRATS. IN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND THE RUSSIANS. AND I WILL TELL YOU, I STILL WANT TO KNOW WHY NOBODY IS INVESTIGATING WHAT RUSSIANS WERE, AND THE DEMOCRATS AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN WERE TALKING TO THROUGH FUSION GPS AND FEEDING THAT INFORMATION INTO THE FBI. NOW WE KNOW THAT BROKE LAST WEEK AND YOU KIND OF ALLUDED TO IT EARLIER, AND, I'M SORRY, BUT THAT DOESN'T SMELL GOOD TO ME. YOU CAN'T BE HAVING POLITICAL ARE MEETINGS THAT EVEN HAVE THE APPEARANCE OF
