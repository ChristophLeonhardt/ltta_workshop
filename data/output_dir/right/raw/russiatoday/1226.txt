there was a mass<font color="#E5E5E5"> pileup a place they</font>

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,520

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's going good then Spain</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore</font>

28
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,329
won't say<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance after chance because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that would be an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exaggeration but there</font>

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity they they had</font>

31
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,220
opportunities<font color="#CCCCCC"> with crosses after the</font>

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,200
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> and right right to the very very</font>

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">end they had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> throw-in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which was</font>

34
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to be long and he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was doing the</font>

35
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:20,490
acrobatic one<font color="#CCCCCC"> when he made a somersault</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and the referee stopped him from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he looked at him is okay I'll</font>

38
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,159
just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and put it to a guy</font>

39
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,900
crossed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and even then they had an</font>

40
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,509
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in many ways</font>

41
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:32,610
Iran has shown us their versatility

42
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,280
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> defended fantastic against one of</font>

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best teams in the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

44
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,750
they had the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to changed a little</font>

45
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,030
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know they play</font>

46
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,799
Portugal in their last game<font color="#CCCCCC"> well that's</font>

47
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:44,759
my question

48
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,890
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that they will go with a</font>

49
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,149
more attacking approach because they

50
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">shown they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,240
what they'll do is they will try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,130
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> the now the quiet I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

53
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,700
lessons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've learned from watching</font>

54
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">Portugal against Morocco and Portugal</font>

55
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:01,610
and

56
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,220
Spain is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this moment in</font>

57
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,830
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> have not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found any form they don't</font>

58
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,530
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as a team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the one player</font>

59
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,360
that's shining above everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,280
tournament is playing in that team<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,930
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is of course or now though his top</font>

62
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,410
scorer so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> he scored four goals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font>

63
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,090
you can stop him<font color="#E5E5E5"> from scoring and stop</font>

64
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,100
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking part in the game then</font>

65
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,980
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've gone a long way to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> combat</font>

66
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,320
Portugal if you like it hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

67
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,560
no one else to<font color="#E5E5E5"> step in in that space</font>

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,190
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ronaldo always leaves and and</font>

69
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,920
and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn or had created any</font>

70
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,950
chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's only been one chance to</font>

71
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,989
another player<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the Portuguese team</font>

72
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:44,959
in that two matches of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 minutes and</font>

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,330
that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tells his own little story so</font>

74
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,150
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carlos Kara's who knows</font>

75
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cristiano Ronaldo really well he's had</font>

76
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,350
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Manchester United he's had him I</font>

77
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,450
think of Real Madrid he's had him also

78
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,030
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Portugal he knows him very very</font>

79
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,310
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> he will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try to keep inquired and</font>

80
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,860
what we learned from Iran today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

81
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,500
when you put a tactics on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board this</font>

82
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how we're gonna play boys they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

83
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,140
it they were throwing bodies<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on the</font>

84
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,269
line literally some incredible last

85
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,580
minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunges to deny God</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no faulting</font>

86
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,620
Iran's commitment<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to win now</font>

87
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,420
against Portugal<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would put it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> round</font>

88
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,370
through in Portugal out<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you give them</font>

89
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,530
a chance based on the the two different

90
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:26,150
arounds that we've seen you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

91
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">table here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so they're a pointing hand</font>

92
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
they have to win you've seen the

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,209
defensive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more attacking Iran do</font>

94
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,400
can they do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm Carlos Cure's now</font>

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,140
okay I'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappointed we lost this</font>

96
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,450
game<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very pleased with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">part in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my players performance and I</font>

98
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:42,769
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think if I had this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation I</font>

99
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,810
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose a situation two games ago I</font>

100
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,850
would definitely pick it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they're</font>

101
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,040
in a great position<font color="#CCCCCC"> they played well</font>

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,890
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well enough to beat</font>

103
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,320
Portugal<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's my honest opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

104
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,390
that of course if more players<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

105
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,100
Portuguese team starts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

106
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,350
perform<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a different story they are</font>

107
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,560
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the European champions so they</font>

108
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,810
know how to win<font color="#CCCCCC"> they know how to get the</font>

109
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,840
job<font color="#CCCCCC"> done and these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Iran players they</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,910
there's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and talking</font>

112
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">about rinaldin</font>

114
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,959
yeah you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know he's maybe not the best</font>

115
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> role again no but it took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">only four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes to score this</font>

118
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,900
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say he might not be the best</font>

119
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,100
play in there well you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

120
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,900
players who are technically better than

121
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,530
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> more but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

122
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,480

<font color="#CCCCCC">players a player and he has he is one</font>

124
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,520
goal away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a full set well I see</font>

125
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,800
earlier I thought that Ronaldo had the

126
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,570
full set because he now has already

127
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,880
after just two games<font color="#CCCCCC"> a penalty a</font>

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">free-kick a header and a shot and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

129
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">you pointed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out that's not the thought</font>

130
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,900
he's got a right-footed shot goal

131
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,570
he needs a<font color="#E5E5E5"> left footed shot goal now and</font>

132
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,030
you know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

134
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,730
of the man but I just repeat myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

135
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,340
played well today<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really well he</font>
