he's a federal judge and he should have been confirmed when he was a nominee but I think that his performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind and he has demonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants here before the court that he would not be able to perform his full full responsibilities retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens just one of the many who believe Cavanaugh is unfit to serve on the nation's highest court one concern is that naming such a partisan figure to the court could end any remaining notion that the Supreme Court is apolitical Paul Butler and le myst√®re are still with me 107 judicial vacancies le when Obama level and President Obama left office because Mitch McConnell said you will see no one you will see no Supreme Court justice you will see no one and only a Republican will be allowed to do it he got away with it so now we're in a point where at a point where Mitch McConnell has said I will wield such total control but even if this man is credibly accused of sexual assault so what too bad the Democrats lost this battle in 2014 when we did not answer the bell in the midterm election to back up Obama we lost the battle again in 2016 when we allowed Donald Trump to be elected so now having lost the war it's a time to ask Democrats what are they willing to do now go away all right I say we burn it down so when it when it comes to 2020 at some point some Democrat is gonna show up on my television and ask me for my vote and they will not get it unless that Democrat is able to tell me what their plan for court packing is I've got my own plan but I want to hear what how they're gonna pack the court how they're going to restore legitimacy to the Supreme Court because I refuse I refuse to look at survivors and victims of sexual assault and tell them that they just have to take it yeah and they just have to sit there and have two of the five Republican Supreme Court justices be credibly accused of sexual harassment and you know so can I believe that Mitch McConnell because I think we should never forget this the original Connell essentially said we own the court we as Republicans it's ours and we have it and we will do it though what we will and if you're a Democrat too bad even if you were president I'd states we own the court and here he is one of my proudest moments is when I looked at Barack Obama in the eye and I said mr. president you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy I mean that disrespect for the President of the United States was the origin story of what men should McConnell is able to do this week yeah and you know as I'm the albergue Brit professor in law at Georgetown Brett Kavanaugh is going to be the Donald Trump Associate Justice of the Supreme Court these five far right-wing conservatives on the court will do the president's bidding so in some ways they may preserve you know the appearance so they may not technically overrule Roe versus Wade but they'll put so many restrictions on providers that essentially women would not be able to get the health care that they want they may not overrule the right of people to get married to whoever they love but they'll say if you don't want to serve those people you don't have to yeah and can we just go through just real quick I'm gonna get you back in Delhi these are the moments that for the Democrats say the Supreme Court is is it is it essentially an enactment an enemy to people who are in the margins of society citizens united where they said spend what you want for your corporation if you're if you're rich Bush v Gore where the Supreme Court majority the Republicans picked up President Clarence Thomas's confirmation the first of two two out of five killing a key part of the Voting Rights Act gutting voting rights and that's the supposed swing vote John Roberts doing and the Cavanaugh confirmation for Republicans they have a flip side argument which is that rejecting Robert Bork who was openly for getting rid of roe v wade roe v wade itself and the Oberkfell decision which allowed same-sex marriage that to them those are existential threats to Christians religious liberty so the two sides both believe that the court is an existential threat how can it be legitimate well the two sides both believe that the court is an existential threat but only one side acts like it so story time right on my way to work there is a Planned Parenthood and every day when I pass that Planned Parenthood there is a lone woman out there protesting with a big pro-life sign yeah I don't agree with her she's there every day sometimes I roll down my window and yell at her she's there every day the Republicans have done this not because they're smarter or better or not because they're more of them but because they are more committed on this issue I have heard people on this network since got cents cuts in Susan Collins did her Laertes thing saying oh well we can't impeach Cavanaugh because I mean we're not gonna get sick I don't care yeah I want him impeached if Democrats take back the house I want a Pietschmann Charles by Martin Luther King Day and was quote one of my favorite movies Remember the Titans I want the Democrats to blitz every down all right because that's what the Republicans do the Republicans do not fold they fight they fight when they win they fight when they're gonna lose they fight when the odds are in their favor or not they fight and it's time for the Democrats to finally show that same fight about these issues because if they don't it's a generation it's a generational change in terms of the rights of women the rights of gays and the rights of minorities and we play because I think that you know Paul is it's on the issues of you know LGBT people and women and minorities that we tend to focus on the Supreme Court but Sheldon Whitehouse who I think has actually been in brilliant over these confirmation hearings because he's reminded people that the real origin of what the Supreme Court has become has to do with money it has to do with more than just rights has to do with dollars and cents here Sheldon Whitehouse we go back to a Supreme Court far too often dancing to the tune of a handful of big Republican special interests big Republican special interests funding the Federalist Society that is now picking Supreme Court nominees big Republican special interests using the unlimited dark money power the Supreme Court gave them to mount TV ad campaigns for Supreme Court nominees people are catching on the record of this is undeniable and as I said it will be a disaster for the court the super-rich have captured the court yeah so we can think of citizens united where the court said that corporations have some of the same kinds of rights as human beings they're protecting their own interests Brett Kavanaugh if he's confirmed will be the poorest person on the Supreme Court he's the only one who's not a millionaire many of them are extremely wealthy and again when we look at how they vote especially the five Republicans what they do is preserve the interest of the rich the white and the wealthy the only kind of discrimination this new court will care about is alleged discrimination against straight white men and have been how are we a democracy if this is a minority you know I think 70 senators represent 30% of the country and they have the power to exert minority rule the majority of people who live in cities or in urban centers who want gun reform who want LGBT equality who want to think they're being told by a minority you may not have it ever we're gonna keep the court forever and you'll never be able to have what the majority wants how are we democracy in that instance the only cure is more democracy right the only cure is more sunlight and this is where I think the media has to take some of the responsibility to hear right if we understand that the Supreme Court is a political organization which it is then it needs to be covered like a political organization right most people most people watching the show who are relatively real it would not recognize John Roberts if he was having a burrito right next to them right and that's partially the media's fault right like we need to put I'm you can't you know bother a Supreme Court you can't hold the Supreme Court justice accountable the way you can your Congressman or your senator right but there's no good reason anymore for the media not to be covering the Supreme Court for everybody not to know who these people are for all the kind of lobbying and and pressure points that is that was put on Jeff Flake to be put on John Roberts the next time he's about to do something like we need better coverage of this and that is that's not that's very that's not small D democracy but that is part of the way to bring transparency to what these robed men and women are doing in secret yeah I think people are very woke up this morning nervous and afraid I've had a lot of text when people were scared who really feel like their future is now in jeopardy because the one sort of backstop has been the court that would protect you do brown v board etc I think a lot of people are worried that's not to be the case anymore Paul Butler people really appreciate you both being here and up next the fight over Kavanagh may have ended in the Senate but but the protests have not ended and they are still in the streets we're gonna talk about that next I think there's merit in that and that criticism and that the senator should really pay attention to it for the good of the court it's not that healthy to get a new justice that can only only do part-time job hey thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on
