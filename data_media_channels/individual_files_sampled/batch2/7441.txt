Ted Cruz was at an event in Austin Texas and he was actually approached by a female Texas resident who has pre-existing conditions and is very much concerned about the state of health care in America and so she approaches him and asks him well first tells him what she's going through and then asks him a very important question take a look February 7th has seven decisions on not counting a female and a survivor of abuses I purchased my individual policy on the health insurance or shall I take this registered medical addresses personally and seriously and I can assure you I'm not the only technician he got my question is will you pledge with the Midler DNA has to prove that oh man thank you for that one of the great things about our democratic system we can treat each other with respect ma'am if you want to engage in himself that's your frog no but I'm not sure no question thank you for being here thank you man okay okay first I do want to give him credit for handling that in a calm and professional manner he really did and I give him credit for that with that said the question will you take a DNA test to prove that your human is amazing and hilarious yeah I I wish he could have had two different interactions with Ted Cruz because the first part of the question was wonderful and really substantive I want to come back to that in a second but let's be real if she just asked that first party wouldn't I made news like it is now everybody's talking about will Ted Cruz take a DNA test to prove he's human or will we find his eggs somewhere yeah and I would say poor Ted Cruz but no because there's like as many fun conspiracy theories about him as almost any politician is he a lizard person interesting question we like Fox News we just asked question we just asked the question lizard person question mark right and and is he the Zodiac killer question mark I don't know okay in reality of course we do know we just clarify because it's the internet he's not okay he has many other issues so but me in all seriousness now so that was fun but the first part of the question was actually devastating and I wish he was forced to answer it she has seven pre-existing conditions and if Ted Cruz's gets his way on health care I want to reiterate the quote she said if you forced me in a high-risk insurance pool which is what Ted Cruz is in favor of that is absolutely true you will either bankrupt me or kill me mm-hmm and that look that's literal and I know the Republicans get upset when you say that but you know what's more upsetting is when you're put into a situation while you're there be bankrupted or killed and so those pre-existing conditions are no joke and for a lot of Americans it will literally kill them and the high-risk pools well those wind up you wind up having to pay a lot more money because they already know you have a condition they don't want to pay for your condition they only want healthy people so they make profit so they don't have to pay for their insurance that is part of what's so sick about relying on private insurance I also wanted to quickly touch on another part of her her question that I think a lot of people are overlooking and talking about this interaction when she talks about her pre-existing conditions she also mentions the fact that she is a woman which you know I think a lot of people forget the Affordable Care Act for as flawed as it is and it is flawed absolutely prior to that being considered a woman was it was a liability I mean you would have to pay significantly more for your health insurance compared to men and it was because you're a woman because the assumption was well women are gonna go see the doctor more women have more health care needs in reality women are better with keeping up with their health and and you know taking preventive measures so they don't wait till the last minute to get super sick and then go to the doctor but the Affordable Care Act helped tackle that issue and so I love that she mentioned that it's very important and finally the thing about him getting a DNA test to prove he's human I don't think she said that in an effort to say that he's a lizard person or a monster or Zodiac killer or anything like that she's tapping into his lack of humanity mm-hmm and I think that it's something that resonates with a lot of people in regard to a lot of politicians yes so the Internet is having fun with it yeah because of the of the rumors rumors but but of course in reality that's it she's asking about his empathy you're absolutely right about that and by the way she did not say being a woman as part of her seven pre-existing condition she said on top of that I'm also right and of course is the issue of pregnancy but you know it's putting that on women and say well you got extra cost is insanity I'm pretty sure that took two to tango there and and and then finally look we shouldn't get used to the idea that private insurance gets to profit off of our misery or our sometimes literally in the case of health care our death so they they say as if it's their right right well I will I will give you insurance if I think I don't have to pay for it and I'm gonna make a profit on it if you're healthy if you're not healthy I don't want to give you insurance but if you don't have insurance you can't afford it and you will be bankrupted or after you're bankrupted you won't have treatment and then you die that's why you can't have private insurance that this is a case it's like a private fire department you can't say wow that's a man you didn't pay for the fire is yours well let your house burned down first of all it's deeply immoral but saying well the fire will spread so there are a lot of different issues as to why this is a an instance where the government should handle it the insurance part not the doctors part it's not a complete takeover of medicine as Diane Feinstein and other Republicans say yes I said other Republicans okay so that's why single-payer makes sense that's why Medicare for all it makes sense that's why defeating Dianne Feinstein makes sense did I say that Allison ours with Alice at heart so
