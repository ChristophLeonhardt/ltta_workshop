1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,540
- We're on our way to D.C.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:02,530
- And I'm mooching.

3
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,030
- Yeah.
- And I'm here too.

4
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,087
- Yay (laughing).

5
00:00:05,087 --> 00:00:08,004
(electronic music)

6
00:00:17,844 --> 00:00:19,224
- [Stewardess] If you
plan to continue using

7
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:21,857
your small, lightweight devices,

8
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:25,098
please make sure your device
is set to airplane mode,

9
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:28,015
or the silent, or it is turned off.

10
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:30,720
- [Hallease - Voiceover]
I decided to disable

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,920
the comments on my
Creators for Change video,

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,753
for a few days

13
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:36,620
and I grappled with that decision.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,300
I'm fine with people disagreeing,

15
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,823
just do it respectfully.

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,433
- You guys, it's snowing.

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,547
It's snowing in D.C, ah.

18
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:49,149
- It's snowing.

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,470
- You're not as excited as I am.

20
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,450
- I mean I lived in it
in like, four years.

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,340
- Well, I'm excited, 'cause it's snowing.

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,489
- It sucks.

23
00:00:57,489 --> 00:00:59,019
- (laughing) It sucks?

24
00:00:59,019 --> 00:00:59,852
- Yeah, it sucks 'cause then

25
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,420
the sun never comes out (laughing).

26
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,253
- Oh.
- Well that's not

27
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:04,459
gonna be the case, today, but.

28
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:06,830
- [Hallease] It's pretty
though, I like it.

29
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:08,860
- Yeah, it's always romantic
the first day or two

30
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,980
and then, as it starts accumulating

31
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,180
and getting more and more cold.

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,120
- So romantic.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,430
- Isn't this great, you
wanna snuggle up by the fire.

34
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,670
- Oh, let's get a fire then.
- Ah?

35
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,670
Oh, okay (laughing).

36
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:22,675
- [Hallease - Voiceover]
Something I've taken

37
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:24,220
great pride in with this community

38
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,920
is how we all interact together below.

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,070
Even when we don't agree,

40
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,080
I watch that comradery vanish in minutes.

41
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,900
Years of work, discussion, discourse,

42
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,603
poof, gone.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,210
So for the rest of the week,

44
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,323
I've found myself somewhat conflicted.

45
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,320
Why do I do this?

46
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,520
What do I do this for?

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,650
As a smaller channel, it's hard
not to be focused on growth,

48
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,360
but, this week gave me pause

49
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,440
and access to what I assume
bigger channels deal with

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,323
on some level pretty regularly.

51
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,630
Do I even want to grow?

52
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,733
Or rather, what's the price of growth?

53
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,193
And am I willing to pay it?

54
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:10,840
- Okay, it's raining, it's wet, but,

55
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,110
we are here, in,

56
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,062
The African American History Museum.

57
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:18,500
- [Mr. Hallease] Woo.
- AKA The Black Smithsonian.

58
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,670
And we are going to--

59
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,140
- The saddest part.
- What?

60
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,730
- The saddest part.
- Yeah, we're gonna start

61
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,880
from the bottom, which is the saddest part

62
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,070
and work our way up, so, watching Oprah,

63
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,533
oh that's an exit, so yeah, here we go.

64
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:42,133
(piano music)

65
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:54,941
(upbeat piano music)

66
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,540
Going through the Black Smithsonian

67
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,883
was a reminder of what is
necessary to achieve change.

68
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,820
Many times, knowing that you'll never see

69
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,750
the fruits of your labor.

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,930
But each rebellion, each lawsuit,

71
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,430
a drop in a bucket,

72
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,080
that will eventually get full

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,189
and overflow.

74
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,189
(upbeat piano music)
(water hissing)

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,233
Okay.

76
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,453
We just finished at the Black Smithsonian.

77
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,133
- Oh yeah, we're still goin',

78
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,158
we're going to 9th.

79
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:48,991
- We're going to 9th?

80
00:03:48,991 --> 00:03:49,824
- Yep.
- Okay.

81
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,286
We just, we know where we're going.

82
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:52,119
- Yes.
- We just finished

83
00:03:52,119 --> 00:03:53,000
at the Black Smithsonian.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,969
- Let me know where we're going.

85
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:56,480
- (laughing) And we
know where we're going.

86
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,030
It was really good.

87
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,920
- Very intense.

88
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,753
- Very intense,

89
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,940
we only made it through
the first three floors.

90
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,260
- In four hours.

91
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,990
- In four hours.

92
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:08,610
So, we're gonna try to
come back on Saturday.

93
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,443
- Yep.
- So we can see

94
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:13,970
the top three floors,
which are happier, I think.

95
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,803
Hopefully.

96
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,640
- We were told.
- We were told.

97
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,240
But it was really good, it
was really good to learn,

98
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,733
more in-depth about the history.

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,290
They give you so many details.

100
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:29,680
- Yeah as opposed to the Texas textbooks.

101
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,690
- Right.
- Oh you know,

102
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,523
civil rights.

103
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,070
- We had slaves and then
we didn't (laughing).

104
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,500
- Did they really have it so bad?

105
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,640
- Right.
- No.

106
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,963
- Yeah, so this is cool.

107
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,310
- Did you look at the
weather before you came here?

108
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,143
- [Hallease] Yes.

109
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:46,240
- You did?

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,073
See.

111
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,520
I was cry full.

112
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,460
I felt like because I
lived out here for so long,

113
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,150
I knew, that knowin' this
time it would be cool,

114
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,173
I mean it would be cool, not cold.

115
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,903
This is cold.

116
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:00,518
A little disrespect (mumbles).

117
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:02,180
(Hallease laughing)

118
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,963
- Chris is like camera two now.

119
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,400
Yeah Mr. Hallease is getting involved,

120
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,660
in the channel in a constructive way.

121
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,493
- [Mr. Hallease] At times.

122
00:05:10,493 --> 00:05:11,760
- When it makes sense

123
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,710
and he's not feeling lazy.

124
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,543
- [Mr. Hallease] When he feels like it.

125
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:14,997
- When he feels like it (laughing).

126
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:18,150
We're heading to dinner.
- There it is, right there.

127
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,670
- Yeah, I noticed you
had the sweat shirt on

128
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,850
and I was like, man you
seem like a tough dude, or,

129
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,792
you just didn't--

130
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,450
- Nah, I didn't.
- Okay.

131
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,320
- But this got the fur
on the inside though,

132
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,710
so it is kinda warm,

133
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,970
but my legs are cold.

134
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:30,833
- [Mr. Hallease] Yeah.

135
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,853
- So after the YouTube event, right,

136
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,470
in L.A, we didn't get out that joint

137
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:40,870
till like, 11,

138
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,570
so I had to drive two hours south,

139
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,240
go to sleep, wake up,

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,363
the car was at the house I watched,

141
00:05:47,363 --> 00:05:49,233
so I only got three hours of sleep.

142
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,050
I didn't pack until the morning.

143
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,050
So I packed at four.

144
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,110
Brought everything except underwear, son.

145
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,150
- [Hallease] You didn't
bring underwear (laughing)?

146
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,340
- I'm wearin' the same
underwear I came in here with.

147
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,510
- Oh, God.

148
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,693
Okay, so, there have been times, yes.

149
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:05,840
- [Man] Air 'em out.

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,760
- Where I have been (laughing),

151
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:12,760
in situations, but as a
lady, let me just say,

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,430
I have washed them in the sink.

153
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,263
- [Man] Yeah.

154
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:18,080
- And blow dried them with a hair dryer

155
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,913
you ain't goin' catch me

156
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,130
in these streets ridin' dirty, okay.

157
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,990
- I pulled them out, I pulled 'em out

158
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,260
and I didn't put 'em in the bag

159
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,200
so I thought I had them.

160
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,880
So when I got here

161
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,160
and I got dressed for the morning,

162
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,544
that's when I realized I didn't have them.

163
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:30,795
- [Hallese] Oh.

164
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:32,360
- [Hallese - Voiceover] Yes, I want to,

165
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,520
quote, succeed at this,

166
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,080
because these bills ain't
goin' pay themselves,

167
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,913
yo all feelin' me,

168
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:39,410
support our channel on Patreon,
link in the description,

169
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,390
and a (mumbles), okay?

170
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,650
I want to succeed, but not at the expense

171
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,483
of all of you

172
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,000
and yet I'm reminded

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,880
of what I said recently
in a Beast Cast episode.

174
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,430
- I wanna be the person that can enable

175
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,020
my family or friends or whoever to

176
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,200
do what they wanna do

177
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,850
'cause there's this whole idea of like,

178
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,320
you hit a certain level of success

179
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,140
and you don't pull the ladder up.

180
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,500
Like after you, you leave it down, right?

181
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,840
And so for me, I keep
thinking of how can I place

182
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,980
myself strategically to climb this ladder

183
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,160
and deal with the things

184
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
that people don't really have the capacity

185
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,140
to deal with that I think I can handle

186
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,620
to break through it

187
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,490
and then, just be pullin'
people up the entire time,

188
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,184
you know what I'm saying?

189
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:27,150
- [Hallease - Voiceover]
I still feel that way.

190
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:29,110
I still feel like I need to succeed

191
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,833
so I can bring others with me.

192
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,610
And God heard me say that

193
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,283
and this was the first test.

194
00:07:37,418 --> 00:07:38,384
- You the camera girl here.

195
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,540
(Hallease laughing)

196
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,700
To get that camera, I hate cameras,

197
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
you know that.

198
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,990
Let me see, okay.

199
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,283
You remember this?

200
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,170
(Hallease humming)

201
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,720
- [Hallease] That's Antoinette.

202
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:58,655
- [Hallease - Voiceover] I've talked about

203
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:00,880
being uncomfortable, on this channel,

204
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,110
and this week was hell-uh uncomfortable.

205
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,360
If this was God's first test

206
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,530
did I fail?

207
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,650
I shut those comments off

208
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:11,040
and the weight of the world left me fam,

209
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,640
but did I fail?

210
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,520
- That's a lovely--
- Take a look at this.

211
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,970
- [Evelyn] Yeah you got nice.

212
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:19,977
- This is growing a little bit.

213
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:21,727
- Yes, it's terrible.

214
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,867
- But that wasn't the
one I was lookin' for,

215
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:25,763
and here, here they are.

216
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,680
The two of you, have you seen this?

217
00:08:30,138 --> 00:08:30,971
And then they got that one.

218
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:33,030
- [Television] Austin Rivers,

219
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,200
it's up knee deep, past yesterday--

220
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,432
- [Mr. Hallease] You always look upset,

221
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,265
(Hallease laughing)

222
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:39,996
like you're just on the
verge of being upset.

223
00:08:39,996 --> 00:08:40,890
- [Hallease - Voiceover] As of now,

224
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,140
the comments are back on.

225
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,650
And I'm slowly engaging.

226
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,420
If nothing else, maybe you
can learn from my mistakes.

227
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,030
