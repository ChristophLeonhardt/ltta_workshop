1
00:00:02,297 --> 00:00:03,164
CHECK IT OUT.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:06,334
WE ARE GOING TO WEIGH IN ON IT

3
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,468
LATER IN THE SHOW.

4
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:09,470
THE RETURN OF BARACK OBAMA.

5
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:12,507
THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF TONIGHT'

6
00:00:12,508 --> 00:00:14,675
WATERS WORDS.

7
00:00:14,676 --> 00:00:16,544
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

8
00:00:16,545 --> 00:00:17,979
RELATIVELY QUIET SINCE LEAVING

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,147
OFFICE BUT POPPED UP?

10
00:00:20,148 --> 00:00:21,782
SOUTH AFRICA.

11
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:28,856
>> UNFORTUNATELY TOO MUCH OF

12
00:00:28,857 --> 00:00:31,726
POLITICS TODAY SEEMS TO REJECT

13
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:33,895
VERY CONCEPT OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH.

14
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:36,397
PEOPLE JUST MAKE STUFF UP.

15
00:00:36,398 --> 00:00:39,367
WE SEE THE UTTER LOSS OF SHAME

16
00:00:39,368 --> 00:00:40,668
AMONG POLITICAL LEADERS WHERE

17
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:42,370
THEY ARE CAUGHT IN A LIE AND

18
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:46,374
THEY DOUBLE DOWN AND LIE SOME

19
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:46,674
MORE.

20
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:49,477
JESSE: WE KNOW HE'S CALLING

21
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:52,380
PRESIDENT TRUMP A LIAR.

22
00:00:52,381 --> 00:00:55,182
THER PRESIDENT OBAMA, HAVE YOU

23
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:55,750
NO SHAME?

24
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,618
>> IF YOU LIKE YOUR DOCTOR YOU

25
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:00,955
WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR DOCTOR

26
00:01:00,956 --> 00:01:01,289
PERIOD.

27
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,691
IF YOU HAVE LIKE YOUR HEALTHCARE

28
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:04,792
PLAN, YOU CAN KEEP YOUR

29
00:01:04,793 --> 00:01:06,460
HEALTHCARE PLAN PERIOD.

30
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,596
THERE IS NO SPYING ON AMERICANS.

31
00:01:08,597 --> 00:01:12,199
WE DON'T HAVE A DOMESTIC SPYING

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,533
PROGRAM.

33
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:19,307
>> A HANDGUN AND CLIPS IS EASIER

34
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:23,678
TRUTH.

35
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,546
BUT SOME ARE SMOOTHER THAN

36
00:01:25,547 --> 00:01:27,815
OTHERS.

37
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:31,886
BARACK, YOU LIED.

38
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:36,290
BUT THE MEDIA COVERED UP YOURS.

39
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,491
SPEAK OF THE PRESS.

40
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:42,163
>> THE PRETHE FREE PRESS IS

41
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:43,264
UNDER ATTACK.

42
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:44,398
PRESIDENT TRUMP DIDN'T ATTACK

43
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,634
THE PRESS AS MUCH AS TRUMP DOES.

44
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:48,936
HE DIDN'T NEED TO.

45
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:51,238
90% OF THE MEDIA WAS ON HIS

46
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:51,906
SIDE.

47
00:01:51,907 --> 00:01:53,975
AND THERE HAS BEEN MORE FAKE

48
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,743
NEWS ABOUT TRUMP IN ONE YEAR

49
00:01:58,647 --> 00:02:00,281
LET THAT SINK IN.

50
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:08,756
A.P. AND FOX NEWS.

51
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:10,191
CONSTANTLY ATTACKED.

52
00:02:10,192 --> 00:02:13,461
THE ESPIONAGE ACT, HE USE I'D IT

53
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:14,895
ALMOST MORE THAN ANY OTHER

54
00:02:14,896 --> 00:02:16,697
PRESIDENT COMBINED TO GO AFTER

55
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:18,699
REPORTERS AND LEAKERS.

56
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,600
EVEN "THE WASHINGTON POST" SAID

57
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:22,336
IT WAS THE LEAST TRANSPARENT

58
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,871
ADMINISTRATION OF ALL TIMES.

59
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,206
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD HIS

60
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,341
AUDIENCE IN AFRICA, WE ARE

61
00:02:27,342 --> 00:02:29,176
LIVING IN STRANGE TIMES.

62
00:02:29,177 --> 00:02:32,346
>> THEY ARE STRANGE.

63
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:39,887
AND THEY ARE UNCERTAIN.

64
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:43,491
BUT EACH DAY'S NEWS CYCLES

65
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:46,127
BRINGING MORE HEAD-SPINNING AND

66
00:02:46,128 --> 00:02:47,762
DISTURBING HEADLINES.

67
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,967
YOUR ADMINISTRATION.

68
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:54,835
REMEMBER OUR PRESIDENT BOWS TO

69
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,704
FOREIGN LEADERS?

70
00:02:56,705 --> 00:02:59,940
RACIAL RIOTS ALL OVER STREETS

71
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:00,641
TACK AMERICA.

72
00:03:00,642 --> 00:03:03,611
A RASH OF DOMESTIC TERROR

73
00:03:03,612 --> 00:03:08,616
ATTACKS, A WOMAN SHOT DEAD BY A

74
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:10,518
DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIEN FELON.

75
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,125
REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT LAUGHING

76
00:03:18,126 --> 00:03:20,294
AND FIST BUMPING AFTER AN

77
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:22,630
AMERICAN WAS BEHEADED?

78
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,167
HERITAGE WITHOUT DENIGRATING

79
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:28,469
THOSE OF A DIFFERENT HERITAGE.

80
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,472
JESSE: I GUESS OBAMA DOESN'T

81
00:03:43,985 --> 00:03:46,787
AND RUN BY WHITE PEOPLE.

82
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,423
HE TAUGHT ME JESUS DID HOW TO

83
00:03:49,424 --> 00:03:52,593
LOVE MY ENEMIES.

84
00:03:52,594 --> 00:03:54,361
JESUS TOLD ME HOW TO LOVE THE

85
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:56,564
HELL OUT OF MY ENEMIES.

86
00:03:56,565 --> 00:03:58,999
JESSE: BARACK OBAMA WAS MARRIED

87
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:12,113
OBAMA WITH FARAKAN.

88
00:04:12,114 --> 00:04:14,515
TOTAL HYPOCRISY WHICH LEAVES US

89
00:04:14,516 --> 00:04:19,587
TO THIS.

90
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:30,531
>> SO MANY [INAUDIBLE]

91
00:04:30,532 --> 00:04:30,998

BILLIONAIRE, RICH BRANSON'S

WORLD CLASS SQUAT.

97
00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:49,283
LEAVING THE WHITE HOUSE.

98
00:04:49,284 --> 00:04:51,952
NOTICE HOW IT HAS A WALL AROUND

99
00:04:51,953 --> 00:04:53,120
IT FOR SECURITY.

100
00:04:53,121 --> 00:04:56,157
I THOUGHT WALLS WERE RACIST.

101
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:58,492
I GUESS NOT.

102
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:00,327
I GUESS PRESIDENT OBAMA SHOULD

00:05:00,328 --> 00:05:01,962
TAKE ADVICE FROM ANOTHER

104
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:02,329
