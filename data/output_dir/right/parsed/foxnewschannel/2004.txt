WILL HE RECERTIFY THAT DEAL OR
STEP THE UNITED STATES AWAY FROM
IT?
KEEP WATCHING.
>> Jessica: FOX NEWS ALERT,
VOTERS HEADING TO THE POLLS IN
FOUR STATES THAT COULD TEST
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CLOUT WITH
G.O.P. VOTERS PARTICULARLY IN
WEST VIRGINIA.
A PRESIDENTIAL EMERGING FELLOW
REPUBLICANS TO VOTE AGAINST
DON BLANKENSHIP WHO HAS BEEN TO
PRISON.
BLANKENSHIP SAYING HE IS
TRUMPIER THEN TRUMP AND NOT
BACKING DOWN.
SO THERE ARE FOUR STATES WITH
PRIMARIES TODAY.
IT HAS FELT TO ME LIKE THIS IS
THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING ON
HERE IN WEST VIRGINIA.
AS OUR GUEST HERE, WHAT DO YOU
IS THAT TRUMPIER THEN TRUMP
HEADED TO MANSION LAND?
>> Gianno: I THINK THE
PRESIDENT HAS LEARNED A LESSON
WHEN IT COMES TO ROY MOORE IN
ALABAMA.
I THINK JOE MANCHIN WHO IS
CURRENTLY VISITING SENATOR THERE
IS A VERY POPULAR AND I KNOW
THAT THERE'S TWO SEATS BEING
TARGETED BY REPUBLICANS IN AREAS
THAT DEMOCRATS -- WHERE
PRESIDENT TRUMP WIN AND DEMOCRAT
AREAS.
BY A LOT SO THIS IS A VERY
IMPORTANT SEAT.
AND JUST THE FACT THAT THIS IS A
GREAT EXAMPLE AS TO WHAT WE CAN
DO IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD
WITH A STRATEGY, THIS
IMPEACHMENT TALK THAT'S BEEN
COMING UP ACROSS THE SPECTRUM IS
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY SERIOUS.
I SPOKE WITH A MEMBER OF THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
RECENTLY WHO SAID THAT IF WE
DON'T GET THE SENATE, IF WE
DON'T KEEP THE SENATE AND WE
LOSE THE HOUSE, THERE CAN LEAD
TO VERY SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS.
SO THIS IS BEYOND JUST MOVING
THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA FORWARD.
IF THIS CAN GO INTO THE
IMPEACHMENT CONVERSATION IF WE
DON'T PICK UP SEATS OR MAINTAIN
CONTROL OF THE SENATE.
>> Harris: 'S IS A PLACE WHERE
THE PRESIDENT SHOULD OR SHOULD
NOT STEP IN?
WHAT HE DID IS DRAW ATTENTION TO
A RACE THAT NOW IS SPLIT AMONG
THREE PEOPLE STATISTICALLY.
I THINK DON BLANKENSHIP IS UP BY
A COUPLE OF POINTS.
>> Rachel: I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD STEP IN.
I DON'T.
I KNOW YOU WORKED FOR
GOVERNOR ROMNEY.
WHEN HE RAN AGAINST OBAMA IN
THAT SECOND TERM, HE FELT LIKE A
PREOBAMA CANDIDATE IN A
POST-OBAMA WORLD.
AND WHEN I SAW THE DEBATE
BETWEEN THE VIRGINIA CANDIDATE,
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANY
OF THEM BUT IT STRUCK ME THAT
THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES WERE
PRETRUMP CANDIDATES AND THAT
BLANKENSHIP WAS SO AUTHENTIC.
I REMEMBER THEY ASKED ALL THREE
OF THEM REALLY DIFFICULT
QUESTIONS AND THE TWO OTHER
CANDIDATES DID THIS SORT OF
POLITICIAN TALKING POINT WHERE
THEY AVOIDED THE DIFFICULT
QUESTION, DIDN'T ANSWER DIRECTLY
IN THE OTHER GUY WHO HAD REALLY
THE WORST WITH PRISON AND PEOPLE
WHO DIED IN HIS CHARGE, HE
