JOHN KERRY SHADOW DIPLOMACY, HOW DOES THAT IMPACT DELIBERATIONS? I DON'T THINK IT IMPACTS IT ALL. THE PRESIDENT SPOKE OUT ABOUT THAT PRETTY CLEARLY. I'M NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD LISTEN TO HIM NOW. THE ADMINISTRATION BLAMING JOHN KERRY IN ENGAGING IN SHADOW DIPLOMACY AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS HOLDING MEETINGS PRIVATELY WITH IRANIAN OFFICIALS TRYING TO SAVE THE NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN. BUT THAT DEAL CAN COME TO A HAULT TOMORROW. WE KNOW NOW THAT THE PRESIDENT WILL MAKE HIS FEELINGS KNOWN. HIS DECISION KNOWN ON THIS. NOW THE COUNT DOWN IS ON. WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND WORLD LEADERS BUY INTO THIS. GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF LOGAN ACT, IT ESSENTIALLY SAYS PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAL ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAA ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAY ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAK ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAN ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEA ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAF ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAD ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAA ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEA ALLOWED TO MAKE ANY KIND OF DEAR NEGOTIATION WITH ANY FOREIGN LEADER. IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR EVEN THOUGH IT'S NEVER USED. IT'S NEVER USED. IF YOU TALK TO MOST CONSERVATIVE LEGAL SCHOLARS THEY WILL TELL YOU IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WHAT JOHN KERRY DID WAS ILLEGAL BUT IT IS CERTAINLY OUTRAGEOUS AND IT IS CERTAINLY HYPOCRITICAL. IF YOU RECALL IN 2015 WHEN JOHN KERRY WAS NEGOTIATING THIS HORRIBLE IRAN DEAL, TOM COTTON AND 46 REPUBLICAN SENATORS WROTE A LETTER TO IRAN'S LEADERS WHERE THEY SIMPLY BLAMED THE SENATE'S ROLE IN THE APPROVAL OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT. JOHN KERRY WAS OUTRAGED. HE EXPRESSED HIS UTTER DISBELIEF AT THEIR IRRESPONSIBLE ACTIONS. THIS IS A QUOTE. TO WRITE THE LEADERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A NEGOTIATION IS QUITE STUNNING AND IGNORES MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES OF PRECEDENT IN THE CONDUCT OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY. TOM COTTON WAS AND IS A SITTING UNITED STATES SENATOR. THE SENATOR HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY. JOHN KERRY HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE IN NOTHING. HE'S A FORMER OFFICIAL. Martha: I THINK YOU POINTED OUT IN SOME THOUGHTS HE POINTED OUT. IT WOULD BE ONE THING IF YOU ARE TRYING TO RALLY WITH SOME OF OUR ALLIES AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO STAND FIRM AGAINST ANY ATTEMPT TO SHATTER THE DEAL, BUT INSTEAD HE'S RALLYING WITH THE ENEMY. HE'S WORKING WITH HE'S WORKING WITH COLLABORATING WITH A TERRORIST STATE, A READING THAT HAS RALLIED MORE PEOPLE CHANT DEATH TO AMERICA IN ORDER TO UNDERMINE THE FOREIGN POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THAT COULD BE COLLUSION WITH A FOREIGN POWER. TO UNDERMINE OUR DEMOCRACY. I THOUGHT WE WERE AGAINST COLLUSION. Martha: WANTED TO CHARGE MIKE FLYNN WITH THE LOGAN ACT IN VIOLATION OF THE LOGAN ACT. OUTRAGED THAT HE WAS DISCUSSING THINGS AS A TRANSITION OFFICIAL WITH A FOREIGN AMBASSADOR. HE WAS ON THE WAY INTO GOVERNMENT AT THAT POINT. YOU JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH BOTH THINGS AS APPLES AND APPLES. IF HE WAS OUTRAGED ABOUT THAT, SHE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE OUTRAGED ABOUT THIS. ABSOLUTELY. JOHN KERRY HAS TRANSITIONED OUT OF GOVERNMENT, HE'S A PRIVATE CITIZEN. HIS DEFENDERS, WHAT THEY WOULD SAY IS ALL FORMER SECRETARIES OF STATE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES AROUND THE WORLD AND CAN WREAK DEL MIKE HENRY KISSINGER DID THIS. HE WAS A GLOBE-TROTTING DIPLOMAT FOR YEARS AFTER LEAVING GOVERNMENT. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. HENRY KISSINGER, ESPECIALLY WITH A SENSITIVE MOMENT LIKE THIS, HE WOULD ASK THE PERMISSION OF THE WHITE HOUSE WHETHER IT WAS A REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT PRESIDENT. HE WOULD CARRY A MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT. Martha: EXACTLY. HOW ABOUT A REQUEST, DO YOU MIND IF I REACH OUT AND HAVE A CONVERSATION OR NOT? LET ME KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO BE UNHELPFUL HERE. BEN RHODES, OBVIOUSLY VERY INVOLVED AS A MEMBER OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WITH THE WHOLE IRAN DEAL AS WELL, OUTRAGED BECAUSE HE HAS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS AN ISRAELI-U.S. ATTEMPT TO DIG UP DIRT ON THE PEOPLE WHO DEVELOPED THIS DEAL IN ORDER TO DISCREDIT THEM AS A SORT OF DOSSIER AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO BUILT THIS DEAL. HE SAYS THIS IS NOT BEHAVIOR THAT SHOULD BE ACCEPTABLE IN A DEMOCRACY. IT'S A THUGGISH, MEAN-SPIRITED, CHILLING AND THREATENING CLOUD OF PUBLIC SERVICE THAT RISKS EXTENDING FAR BEYOND ME, AND COLLIN, WHO WAS ALSO NAMED IN THEM. WHAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT DO KNOW IT'S UNACCEPTABLE IN OUR DEMOCRACY? BEN RHODES. IT THE LEAST QUALIFIED PERSON TO EVER SIT IN A POSITION OF AUTHORITY IN FOREIGN POLICY. I DOUBT THAT THE STORY IS TRUE. I DOUBT THAT DONALD TRUMP'S WHITE HOUSE WAS DOING THIS, THEY SAY THE TRUMP TEAM MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS. THAT COULD BE ANYBODY. I THINK MIKE POMPEO AND JOHN BOLTON HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO LEANING UP BEN RHODES' MASSES AND TO DIG UP DIRT. Martha: WORTH REMEMBERING THAT BEN ROSE BRAG ABOUT THE ECHO CHAMBER AND THE YOUNG JOURNALISTS IN THEIR 20s WHO DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY THAT HE WAS ABLE TO CREATE THIS ECHO CHAMBER TO
