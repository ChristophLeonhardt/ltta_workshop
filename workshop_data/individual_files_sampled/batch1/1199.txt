hello I'm Adrian Finnegan this is counting the cost on al-jazeera your weekly look at the world of business and economics this week tariffs on thousands of products the biggest trading Giants on the planet just escalated their trade war also this week india's rupee it's now the worst-performing currency in asia we'll take a look at y+ y an upcoming election is causing ice cream sales to melt away in Kabul when the world's two biggest economic powers engage in a trade war the rest of the world is left watching and wondering where it will all end if this week is anything to go by it could mean an escalation the ongoing protracted tit-for-tat trade dispute between China and the United States did intensify this week so much so that it prompted a warning from the OECD the paris-based think-tank says that the world's economy can't keep growing if things don't improve on the trade front China has now slapped tariffs on around 60 billion dollars worth of u.s. goods that move a retaliation for the latest round of US tariffs on two hundred billion dollars worth of Chinese products al Jazeera Scott Heidler reports now from Beijing within hours of the US announcing a second round of tariffs on Chinese goods Beijing responded the Chinese commerce ministry saying it had no choice but to retaliate and it hopes the u.s. changes its behavior one official saying the move is poisoning trade Tom's syndrome a founder regarding America's new round of tariffs China has no choice but to retaliate it was expected that the ongoing trade war could heat up his new round of tariffs from Washington confirmed that and it will be a lot of money coming into the coffers of the United States of America a lot of money coming in a lot of money in the form of tariffs on an additional 200 billion dollars of Chinese imports the US government will begin collecting a ten percent tariff on those Goods starting on September the 24th through the end of the year then on January first the tariffs will jump to 25% and if China at any time retaliates the White House says an additional 267 billion dollars of Chinese imports practically the remainder of all Chinese products sold in the US will also fall under the tariffs the increased tensions will likely scuttle the renewal of trade talks between Beijing and Washington while about 5,000 Chinese products including household goods from vacuum cleaners to bikes will be targeted many US businesses are expected to suffer as well just before the tariffs were announced in Washington that Chinese Commerce secretary said that US protectionism won't only impact the two nations involved in this trade war but it could hurt the global economy as well and some analysts here feel that US companies might face a Chinese consumer backlash if the Chinese people believe that they're being maligned all right they will boycott and that's that's not something you know you're gonna see you're already starting to see some anti-american sentiment says well I'm not gonna buy that it's American alright I mean this is the one thing Donald Trump thinks that the only people who are nationalistic already and as the world's two largest economies refused to concede any ground in this trade war the impact will be felt around the world joining us now from London is Greg Swenson Greg's the founding partner of london-based brig macadam a fine company which focuses on investments in emerging and frontier markets good to have you with us Greg what is the the endgame here are we perhaps being a little naive in seeing these these terraces as nothing other than protectionist is this more about a battle for global economic hegemony yeah I mean it's a it's a great question I don't think this the goal has been demonstrated or the goal has been articulated well by the president what he seems to dwell on is the trade deficit and he picks these arbitrary numbers or targets for trade deficit reduction which i think is a mistake what he should focus on is that China is violating all kinds of free market and open market policies and rules you know they've taken them to the WTO 16 times in the last couple of years and they've won all 16 times but that doesn't seem to be fixing the major problems which are you know theft of IP and you know the complete disregard for free market principles so look I wish that there was a better way and perhaps there is he's picked this one and I think that he's he's somewhat lost the narrative or lost the messaging battle because it looks like the US is provoking a trade war when in fact what they're what he's trying to do is is fix something that needs to be fixed I don't think these these tariffs will stay in place because they're they're self-defeating it's not gonna it's not really going to hurt the American consumer or the American economy you know in many ways that the president's playing with the houses money that you know the economy is is kicking on all cylinders all right what about commodities what will the impact be on commodities given that the China requires huge amounts of imported raw materials I mean where China moves in the market everyone sits up and listens yeah and I think that's important especially for countries you know for like Australia which which is you know close by and produces a lot of coal and ships a lot of coal too and other minerals to China well look disruption in supply chains is always a challenge I don't think it's meaningful for the US economy and I think that the Chinese have a lot more to lose if there are you know in a trade war but the commodity issue is a big deal for for global commodity prices and how much potential does this have to cause damage to the the digital economy for instance rare earth minerals aren't on the list smartwatches aren't on the list and yet things like frogs legs reveals are yeah I mean I looked the president you know is is here's a politician he's not a politician by nature and he's and and this is new to him but there's definitely some politics involved he quite purposely left you know mobile phones off the list rare earth minerals are important the last time the Chinese put a stop to to exporting or put a cap on exports it really shook up the rare earth market to the point where there was a lot of development in Canada in the US and a certain to a certain degree in in Australia but again that's just another example of the Chinese distorting the private market and not behaving in a free open market model what do you make of objective as comments about quantum computing and an AI in basically you know cooking a snooker at the US saying we're already there our economy is gonna be way ahead of the US because we've got this technology well yeah because they're they're stealing the technology so that mean that the u.s. clearly and not just us but our allies and trading partners around the world are seeing China and in this 2025 you know model that that she has put in place like is it a threat of course it is because theft of of IP is is clearly a violation of free and free and open market I think there are other ways to deal with this then get rather than getting into a trade war but in in in this case it seems to be the only way that's going to get anybody's attention I'm not sure it's being perfectly executed but and Jack Ma brings up some some interesting points but I think something clearly has to be done Greg you say that US consumers aren't gonna be hurt by this what potential does this have to damage China's economy and what leverage does China have I mean talk about Jack Mar again he was saying that he can't deliver on his promise to President Trump to create 1 million jobs in the US blaming that the current trade tension I mean if Chinese President Xi really wanted to up the stakes further could he do something drastic like calling US debt yeah I mean that's that's always out there as potential I don't know what else they would do with that money they absolutely absolutely need to own US Treasuries but look there's a few things they can do and this is worrisome because they control the economy it's a top-down economy they control the press she could surely sort of have a media campaign a state-run media campaign against us products he could also devalue the currency it's dangerous game to play but he can do it and they've done it in the past and he can also regulate even more so what's happened in the last few years especially since the crisis is the state has lent money to the state-owned companies at ridiculous levels which is you know obviously putting other companies and foreign competitors out of business but remember the the u.s. is importing 500 billion of goods from China often because of the low cost and low labor costs the Chinese are only importing 130 billions so the US has a lot more a bill of a much better ability to punish China here and and and that's something obvious but also the San Francisco fed made a very good point recently that eighty eight and a half percent of of goods and services that are consumed by American consumers are produced in the US it's not it's not really a huge importer compared to what we produce domestically so yes we are a big importer yes we import a lot of cheap goods from China but that's not going to move the needle that that much because again eighty eight and a half percent is produced domestically so again as a conservative or as a businessman as a capitalist I don't like tariffs I don't like trade wars but it seems to be you know the last resort at this point I don't think the message is clear but I but I think something obviously has to be done and he's got support on both sides of the aisle Greg really good to talk to you many thanks to you for being with us not counting the cost nice to be here Adrian thank you all right still to come on this week's counting the cost a Japanese billionaires named as the world's first space tourist but first a sabotage scare is threatening to hurt Australia's strawberry growers they've warned about an overreaction after several people found sewing needles inside the fresh fruit as Andrew Thomas reports from Sydney some reports are hoaxes but the devastating impact on the industry is still the same the lady who posted this video says it illustrates the worst thing to ever happen to her family the family business growing strawberries has been forced to dump its product at the busiest time of the year supermarkets won't buy the fruit in normal quantities because their customers fear what the strawberries may contain last week there was what seemed like an isolated case of a sewing needle inserted in a strawberry probably by a disgruntled employee at a strawberry farm but since there have been reports of more than 20 copycat incidents around Australia in writing - the motivation in relation to these offences we still haven't have any confirmed motivation or reasons why a person would want to do this there is speculation that some cases are children putting needles into strawberries while they're sitting on shop shelves other cases are complete hoaxes people pretending to find needles in strawberries once they're home it's not a joke it's not funny you're putting the livelihoods of hard-working Australians at risk and you're scaring children and you're a coward and you're a grub and if you do that sort of thing in this country we will come after you and we will throw the book at you the government plans to bring in emergency legislation with prison sentences of up to 10 years for hoaxes and up to 15 years for contamination endangering others those in Australia strawberry industry are recommending that people cut up their fruits before biting into it but some are choosing not to buy strawberries at all and for the industry worth nearly a hundred million dollars a year that's a crisis strawberries that are being sold are heavily discounted almost as low as the equivalent of one u.s. dollar upon it and farmers of other fruits are fearful to someone has claimed to have found a needle in a banana and in Sydney an apple just freaked me out I'm thinking my daughter normally just grabs and just bite into apples the strawberries scare threatens to spread now as consumers become more aware of the health effects of consuming sugar soda Giants are doing everything to stay profitable the coca-cola company is even looking at experimenting with a new ingredient it's a bitter to looking at the market for cannabis related products coca cannabis anyone well not quite there's a chemical found in marijuana known as CBD it's already used in beverages and locations where the drug is legalized but it's not psychoactive drinks containing it though are higher priced than sugar infused soda coke is also on a buying spree at bought cost a coffee for 5.1 billion dollars earlier this month and on Tuesday it snapped up an Australian fermented tea company now since the United States invaded Afghanistan in 2001 one song as echoed across cobbles neighborhoods it's happy birthday blasts from the speaker's of hundreds of ice cream carts across the capital but the recent surge in violence ahead of the upcoming election there has caused their profits to plummet al-jazeera's Charlotte Bellis reports now from Kabul happy birthday floats over the blast walls of central Kabul the music comes from an ice cream cart the man pushing it is sure early the 35 year olds not from carpel but it streets and this

has sold burgers outside a mosque for 4 years his income is just 25% of what it once was we asked him if he sees a link between security and sales very much we used to have a very good business but it's deteriorating day by day this week we have sold very little for Afghans even 20 cents for an ice-cream is 20 cents too much in the last quarter the International Monetary Fund found that continued violence and political uncertainty around the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections is hurting economic confidence and growth there are dozens of ice cream sellers ensure Ally's patch of Kabul he competes with 50 most vendors make about $100 a month from this sherilee supports his wife and four children he says he's looking for change in upcoming elections I want security for

and military spending since then security is worsened and so has the economy Shirley keeps walking happy birthday rings hopeful over the neighborhood and used to draw people out of their homes now not even ice cream can draw Afghans to the streets emerging market currencies have been a big focus for us here on counting the cost these past few months and this week we saw Turkey unveil its long-awaited plan to find a way at a crisis its Finance Minister Bennett Al Barak was put in charge of the economy two months ago by his father-in-law President Richard Tiber the one he sharply cut turkeys growth forecasts for this year and next he also promised to slash public spending by nearly ten billion dollars and blamed some of turkeys problems on a spat with the u.s. oh no sir this period is a period when economic sanctions are being used like weapons it's a globally challenging period on the 10th of August turkey became part of this process because its economy and currency were targeted with attacks currency was in India too where the government has struggled to defend the rupee non-essential import restrictions announced this week of left businesses unhappy and there are fears of protectionist policies being put into place the rupee is now the worst-performing currency in Asia despite government efforts to turn the tide India's often referred to as the world's fastest growing large economy but its currency has hit a series of record lows versus the dollar over the past few months that weakness in the currency has coincided with rising global oil prices compounding the pain all of this means that the current account deficit has widened it's now a 2.4 percent of gross domestic product so far growth has held up gross domestic product grew 8.2 percent from April to June and that's its fastest rise in two years but there are worries that it may take a hit to the finance minister in India is Alan Jaitley he's blamed the depreciation of the rupee on global factors including the us-china trade war well joining us now from Glasgow is Gregory Winn greggers chief economist at global council gregor good to have you with us again on counting the cost of what is going on at the moment with that with India's economy what are you advising clients well India is suffering from a currency crisis at the moments the rupee has fallen by 12 percents that's quite significant there are a few factors that contributing to that the price of oil is going up for a country like India which imports much of its energy that pushes up the import bill and the export side is supposed that our concerns about the global environment for trade us protectionism but probably above all there are concerns about divergence and global monetary conditions US interest rates rising that's exposed vulnerabilities in quite a few countries Argentina Turkey also we've seen currencies fall across Asia and India has not been immune to that and that's probably why the currencies under pressure and that's that's that's a concern for the government you mentioned one of the factors is the the price of a fuel India buying oil of course it in dollars and as the rupee Falls oils just gets more and more expensive well exactly an accounts for quite a large parts of the the bill for average Indians at the price of energy so it really does squeeze living standards and it's a political concern as I suggested and there's not a whole lot that the Indian economy ministry the Finance Ministry of the governments can do about that other than try and address other factors that are helping to put downward pressure on the rent on the rupee so factors such as raising interest rates that that's a move in the right direction by the Reserve Bank you mentioned Turkey on Thursday turkey announced a new economic plan which is well it's failed to impress really m''d growth forecast in that economic plan is is India gonna be forced to follow suit well I mean turkey actually today is trying to deal with concerns that it that it's economic plan has been to the egg that its response to what what is a much more significant currency crisis facing Turkey has has has been inadequate that the Turkish leaders fall in something like forty percent over the course of this year the country is a new finance minister it turns out it's the president's son-in-law that that is arguably damaged credibility of economic policymaking in Turkey and the new finance minister was trying to flesh out Turkey's policy response India's not quite in the same situation as Turkey Turkey has a much larger current account deficit inflation is much higher in Turkey that there are greater concerns about the stability and sustainability of growth in Turkey and while the Indian policy response so far arguably has not been adequate more bill will be required and and the direction of policy in India is questionable with m4 curbs Turkey has a bigger challenge in convincing markets that actually the substance behind the headlines of the economic fund that the finance minister is fleshing out today Greger really good to talk to you on countering the cost money thanks Andy for being with us you're very welcome now Qatar and Japan are teaming up to manufacture electric cars the new nine billion dollar project involves building several factories from scratch the new industry is expected to be up and running by 2020 for the first car to roll off the assembly line will be called Katara it'll be launched in conjunction with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 the project is backed by arm of Japan and finally this week space the final frontier for tourism if you're to believe rocket company SpaceX this week it named its first customer Victoria Gaytan B has more now on plans for what would be an historic trip around the moon the Japanese entrepreneur who hopes to be the first person to fly to the moon in a private rocket won't reveal how much it's going to cost but yuusaku may sour says it will be worth it and he won't be alone on the more than 380,000 kilometers Ernie which is scheduled for 2023 the Japanese billionaire pitched an idea to the california-based company SpaceX he wants to make it an autistic collective experience so he's inviting as many as 8 other people including artists designers and architects to join him in what would be an historic moment he hopes seeing the moon up close and the Earth from space will inspire new creative ideas for mankind the moon has filled our imagination and without most love and respect for the moon our planet's constant partner I named this project he also says the CEO of SpaceX Elon Musk might be extended an invite SpaceX has already logged several milestones in space exploration it was the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and bring it back to earth in 2010 the Black Falcon rocket which will take passengers to the moon is still being developed musk says there will be several unmanned launches and countless hours of training before the first commercial trip whenever it's the first flight of an of something on a new technology and we're talking about deep space now you have to be a very very person to do that this is not no small matter space tourism launched in 2001 when a Californian businessman paid to go on a Russian rocket to the International Space Station if Mazur makes it to the moon he'll join an elite group of astronauts who can look up at the moon from Earth and say I've been there and that is our show for this week if you'd like to get in touch with us about anything that
