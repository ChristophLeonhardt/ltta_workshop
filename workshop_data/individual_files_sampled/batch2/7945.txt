following Doug Jones winning the Senate seat in Alabama Donald Trump couldn't contain himself and so he took to Twitter got rid of his staffers for at least a couple minutes so he could go ahead and mouth off and talk about how he's been right all along even though he hasn't been right at any moment of this election including the primaries so this was the second tweet that Trump put out following the results of the Alabama Senate election so let's take a look at graphic 12 he wrote the following the reason I originally endorsed Luther strange and his numbers went up mightily is that I said why Moore will not be able to win the general election I was right I worked hard but the deck was stacked against him okay that guy he's unreal he's unreal so not what do you mean you were right you went right next to Alabama held a rally told everybody to vote for Roy morning you said literally quote get out and vote for Roy Moore you recorded a robo call to tell people to vote for Roy well what do you mean you were right in fact you were wrong twice not once but twice you said you told people the Rowan primary vote for Luther strange and and they didn't they didn't listen to you you know how he said they're all made a big difference actually I had the polling and the polling shows it made no difference at all I have had the exact numbers because I looked into it I was curious to see if Trump's support for specifically Luther strange made any difference right and here's what happened cuz in that tweet he said I supported Luther strange and his numbers went up mightily not true okay a poll released one day before the primary runoff in September showed more bleeding strange by 11 points the survey was conducted after Trump appeared at a rally to campaign alongside strange and after he had made that appearance you're right Jake absolutely no difference in the polling regarding Roy Moore and Luther strange I mean this guy is such a clown so during the primaries supported Luther strange obviously Luther strange lost Roy Moore won that's when Trump started backing Roy Moore did so rather aggressively and obviously Roy Moore lost he can't handle the fact that he's a loser right he it he has such thin skin he couldn't help himself the original tweet that was put out by Trump's Twitter account and certainly was not written by him but that's just my speculation said the following congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard-fought victory there's no way he rose he didn't write this no way there aren't random capitalizations throughout this tweet the write-in votes played a very big factor but a win is a win the people of Alabama are great and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time it never ends they added that exclamation point to pretend like it was actually Trump come on who are you kidding okay we know when it's the official guy writing the tweet and we know when it's Trump okay then his bitter man I was right all along was actually Trump that's obvious right so look on that one more stat on the weather his support of Luther strange made a difference 31% said that Trump backing stranger would make it more likely they vote for twenty nine and a half percent said he would make it less likely okay 31 29 F and then 37 percent said it makes no difference at all so no difference so and as we know of course Roy more easily beat Luther strange so he not only lost he lost twice in one election I don't know if he's getting tired of losing I know that you know what Trump and then he was right about one thing I'm starting to get tired of winning I mean if I had told you and I know that it's a unique situation with Roy Moore being particularly monstrous but if I had told you in Trump comes in that the Republican Party is going to be in such miserable shape that whoever Trump backs will lose in Alabama and will lose twice in Alabama and will have a Democratic senator coming out of Alabama it before one year is up in Trump's presidency no one would have believed that they would they would have said as they office it you're crazy not an Alabama that's never gonna happen but he found a way to lose what did I tell you I a segment before the election loser Donald I did a hundred of him cuz I know this guy he's a loser through and through the only reason he won once in his life and it was a monumental winner of course I grant you that right but it's because he ran against the establishment he ran against the elites he ran against the worst most unpopular candidate there was that was the exception not the rule the rule is Donald Trump will always find a way to lose and even the even in the presidency whoa whoa Jake he won the presidency he's not even gonna make it the whole way he's gonna find a way to turn that win into a monumental historic loss he's gonna implode the Republican Party as I told you from day one and then lead the White House in utter shame so that his victory will turn into an epic historic debacle you just watched the video by The Young Turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT
