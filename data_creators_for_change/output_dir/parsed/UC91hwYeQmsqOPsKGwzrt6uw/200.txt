I've had this since November no actually
I had this since December and I have not
installed this any vet has been on my
head about it but it's been like six
months so she should be on my head so
I'm not a very handy guy nor do I know
much about installing hardwood floors
but I think it would be easy for me to
save up or not got a couple features or
do a show and I several thousand dollars
had someone install this however what I
won't be able to gain is the knowledge
it takes to put this down the experience
nor will I gain possibility to teach my
son's how to do this so when I think
about doing this type of stuff I feel
like it's important for me to do it just
so I could teach it too much other you
know
hey yo what up we have the old school
jams rockin I recruited my dad to come
help me get these floors up uh making
some good progress we have no idea what
we're doing really but um yeah it is on
Father's Day so I put him to work you
know what I'm saying you know what
happened was I knew I could get him over
here if I say hey can you help me to do
something you know since it was my way
spending some time with the old guy and
I put on the old jazz because I want him
to feel at home you know I'm saying it's
not 1960 anymore so the TV is we had to
move it so we can do the floors because
we have to be it was in the way because
it was on furniture we needed to move
the furniture he was gone yeah we just
took up all the carpet carpets all good
and I decided to do the popcorn ceilings
so all this crap are you excited about
that yes
oh you're gonna get on
left
what yo this is like my fourth time at
Lowe's today
and it's not that I'm not forgetting
stuff but it's more of like the thing
like I don't know what I'm doing so
Anthony Cruz handling business you've
been with me almost all day
Eric Kingsley came through for cameo
high and work work for a little bit my
dad was there this morning and so um
you got all the we got all the popcorn
ceiling off the floor and then we
started sanding and then I didn't cover
up the furniture so now the furniture is
all dusty so this is gonna cause a
problem you have the things to cover
furniture when you're painting and stuff
like that looks like you're well into
your project yeah for Father's Day a lot
of people kept asking me if I was going
to do like a big celebration or like a
post or a special thing and my wife
asked me what I wanted for Father's Day
what I wanted was the opportunity to
feel like a father I spent the day with
my dad and a couple buddies of mine
removing the carpet and on Monday all
day we're going to be putting down
laminate flooring
and I just want to like help people
understand that for me every Monday
every time I put out a video it's like
Father's Day I'm not really big on
holidays I think holidays become a kind
of goofy because we make a big hoorah
you know I give gifts and spend time
with family that we probably should be
spending time with anyway and so for
Father's Day for me it's more personal
and so for Father's Day for me it's more
of a time for me to work
too much what it works if the fridge is
gonna be yeah somewhere right here is
too much yeah oh yeah so here's the
dilemma first of all we don't know what
we're doing
Daniel knows more of what we're doing I
don't know anything at all but he has
all the tools so he looks super legit
but check this out
keep trying to measure these walls with
a molding and now we did good over here
supper that little gap
it's just not freaking easy you know I'm
saying I feel like my wife would be
better at this because she's a math
teacher yeah so I actually figured out
what I
okay it's all coming together
he's got finished putting them all the
end only problem is I'm missing this one
piece you ran out of the baseboards so I
got to get that one piece but other than
that this is going to be a success story
I'm not done but I'm close to being done
I knew I was gonna feel good about you
know like laying down the floors or
doing something like that massive of a
job and I got a lot of help I'm ready my
buddy Daniel helped my cousin Sheldon
help Anthony Cruz help Eric Kings need
help my dad helped Jimmy help like that
much there's something about the feeling
of being capable I just can't describe
to you right now
how freaking capable I feel I feel like
the feeling I have right now is worth
every bit of the almost four days we
spend doing this crap given the right
tools I can build something I can make
something with my hands and that feeling
is worth it there was a lot of times
where I was just tired over it and
thinking like man why did I even start
this know begin this process and think
that I was capable II do this is going
to put a lot more on the honey-do list
I feel valuable that's what I feel
valuable that's how I feel
okay let's go ahead in this
to be honest I did not think this would
fit 12 feet of baseboard
tom is now 4 o'clock a.m. I am so tired
but it is so worth it
there's a lot of precision attention to
detail I am I'm ok with this
even the kids it is fly see the real
problem with hardwood floors
is that they're just louder so when they
cried that's the only problem
thank you tell me what you think about
the new floors
do you like the floors
you don't like the floors
