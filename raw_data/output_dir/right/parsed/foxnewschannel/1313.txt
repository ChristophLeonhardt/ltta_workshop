>> Martha: SO COMING TO US
MOMENTS AGO FROM THE BROWARD
COUNTY STATE ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE IN FLORIDA, YOU
SHOULD KNOW THERE IS A NEW
AND APPEARS TO BE SHOT BY
THE PARKLAND SCHOOL SHOOTER
AND BRAGGING ABOUT HIS
PLANS.
IT WAS RECORDED THE MORNING
BEFORE HE MURDERED 17 PEOPLE
AND WOUNDED 17 OTHERS.
THIS IS JUST A FREEZE FRAME
FROM IT.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO SHOW IT
TO YOU.
IT IS A SICK ATTEMPT TO GAIN
ATTENTION AMEND WE JUST
SIMPLY ARE NOT GOING TO PUT
IT ON THE AIR.
JOINING ME NOW IS FLORIDA
GOVERNOR RICK SCOTT WHO HAS
BEEN WORKING IN HIS STATE TO
TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS
NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.
I GUESS INITIALLY, GOVERNOR,
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS LATEST
LATEST.
>> IT'S DISGUSTING.
IT'S JUST HORRIBLE.
YOU THINK ABOUT THESE POOR
FAMILIES.
YOU KNOW, AND YOU -- I CAN'T
IMAGINE IF IT HAPPENED TO
YOUR CHILD OR YOUR
GRANDCHILD, YOU KNOW, OUR
SCHOOLS NEED TO BE SAFE.
THEY NEED -- WE ALL AS
PARENTS WANT TO MAKE SURE
OUR KIDS ARE SAFE AT HOME.
THEY NEED TO BE SAFE WHEN
THEY GO TO SCHOOL.
MY GOAL IS IT NEVER HAPPENS
AGAIN IN FLORIDA.
WE WORKED HARD TO PASS
LEGISLATION THAT, YOU KNOW,
MOVED THE BALL DOWN THE
COURT TO TRY TO MAKE IT
SAFER FOR ALL PARENTS AND
ALL KIDS.
>> Martha: RAISED THE AGE TO
21.
>> WHAT WE DID IS SAID ALL
OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO
HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT
OFFICERS.
>> Martha: HOW ARE YOU DOING
WITH THAT?
>> THEY ARE REQUIRED TO
IMPLEMENT IT BY THE SCHOOL
YEAR.
THEY WERE ALREADY
IMPLEMENTED AS SOON AS THIS
HAPPENED.
WE ACTUALLY EACH AT THE
SCHOOL THERE STONEMAN
DOUGLAS WE PROVIDED HIGHWAY
SAFETY RIGHT AFTERWARDS.
THE PARENTS DIDN'T THINK
THERE WAS ENOUGH RIGHT
AFTERWARDS, SO I ADDED
HIGHWAY PATROL.
THE NUMBER ONE SCHOOLS ARE
GOING TO HAVE LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
NUMBER TWO, MORE MENTAL
HEALTH COUNSELORS.
NUMBER THREE, WE GAVE THEM
MORE MONEY.
WE WERE ALREADY GIVING THEM
MONEY EVERY YEAR FOR
HARDENING.
BULLET PROOF GLASS, METAL
DETECTORS, FEWER ENTRANCES
AND EXITS.
NUMBER FOUR, WE SAID IF YOU
ARE THREATENING HARM TO
YOURSELF OR SOMEBODY ELSE
THROUGH A COURT PROCESS, DUE
PROCESS, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
HAVE ACCESS TO A WEAPON.
AND YOU SHOULDN'T.
>> Martha: NO.
THAT'S SUCH A HUGE PART OF
THIS.
WHAT ABOUT THE
ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE
SHERIFF.
THE POLICE OFFICERS WHO WENT
TO HIS HOUSE 27 TIMES.
THE SECURITY GUARD WHO RAN
AWAY.
WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY
FOR THE LEGAL, THE
GOVERNMENT ARM THAT REALLY
FAILED YOUR SCHOOL?
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FBI.
>> Martha: YEAH.
>> INFORMED TWICE.
ONE TIME VERY SPECIFICALLY
FIVE WEEKS AHEAD OF TIME.
INFEWER UNITED STATES YOU
ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY.
HERE IS WHAT I WAS ABLE TO
DO.
WITH REGARD TO THE SHERIFF'S
OFFICE, WHAT WE DID IS HAVE
VERIFICATION GOING ON
INDEPENDENT BY THE FLORIDA
DEPARTMENT OF LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH, YOU
KNOW, THE WAY THEY DO IT IS
START WITH ALL THE VIDEOS
AND START DOING ALL THE
INTERVIEWS TO FIND OUT
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
AS GOVERNOR, IF I FIND
MALFEASANCE, THEN I HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD PEOPLE
ACCOUNTABLE, AND I WILL.
>> Martha: MEANING THEY WILL
BE FIRED.
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
SO, BUT HERE'S WHAT'S
FRUSTRATING TO ME.
HAVE WE HEARD ANYTHING FROM
THE FBI.
>> Martha: NO.
>> NOTHING.
NOW, THINK ABOUT IT I HAVE
HAD THREE SHOOTINGS.
>> Martha: INCREDIBLE.
>> I HAVE HAD THE PULSE, THE
AIRPORT AND I HAVE HAD THIS.
TO THIS DATE I HAVE NEVER
HEARD OF ANY ACCOUNTABILITY.
SO I BELIEVE IN
ACCOUNTABILITY.
WE DO IT WITH OUR FAMILIES.
SO I AM GOING THROUGH A
PROCESS IN THE STATE, A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION WE
WILL HOLD PEOPLE
ACCOUNTABLE.
>> Martha: I WANT TO ASK YOU
A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE
ELECTION AND SOMEWHAT
PERIPHERALLY RELATED BECAUSE
YOU ARE RUNNING FOR SENATE
AGAINST NELSON WHO HAS BEEN
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM
FLORIDA FOR MANY YEARS.
THERE IS A LOFT PEOPLE WHO
HAVE MOVED FROM PUERTO RICO
TO FLORIDA AFTER HURRICANE
MARIA.
AND THERE ARE EFFORTS BY THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO SIGN
THEM UP AS DEMOCRATS BECAUSE
MOST OF THEM DO NOT CHOOSE A
PARTY AFFILIATION.
IS THAT GOING TO HAVE AN
IMPACT ON THE FLORIDA
ELECTION?
>> WELL, FIRST OFF, ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENED WITH PUERTO
RICO SHOULD NOT BE ABOUT
POLITICS.
I'M GOING BACK THERE
TOMORROW FOR MY SIXTH VISIT.
AND I'M GOING BACK THERE TO
TRY TO HELP THEM.
I WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR.
GOVERNOR INVITED ME BACK
AGAIN.
TO SAY HOW DO WE HELP YOU
GET YOUR ECONOMY GOING.
>> Martha: DO YOU BELIEVE
THE NEW NUMBERS FROM THE
STUDY THAT 4600 PEOPLE LOST LOST
THEIR LIVES IN THAT
HURRICANE NOT 64 OR WHATEVER
THEY SAID IT WAS?
>> WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS
YOU KNOW, IT'S HORRIBLE.
YOU KNOW, WE WENT THROUGH
IRMA.
THAT WHOLE HURRICANE WAS I
WANT TO KEEP EVERYBODY
ALIVE.
REBUILD YOUR HOUSE BUT GOT
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.
KNOW, WHATEVER THE NUMBER
IS, YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TO LOSE THEIR LIFE.
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TAKEN
UTILITY COMPANIES OVER
THERE.
I WORKED WITH EVERYBODY TO
SAY HOW DO WE GET PUERTO
RICO BACK RUNNING AGAIN?
AND ALL THE PUERTO RICANS
THAT CAME TO FLORIDA, HOW DO
WE GET THEM A JOB, GET THEIR
KIDS IN SCHOOL.
MAKE SURE THEY ARE PART OF
OUR ECONOMY.
WE ARE THE BEST MELTING POT
IN THE WORLD.
