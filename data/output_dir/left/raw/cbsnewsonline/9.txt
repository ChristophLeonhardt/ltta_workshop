254
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,044

00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,758

339
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,140

AND THEY'RE NOT GOOD TO YOUR

350
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:13,158

351
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,059
HOW DO YOU WIN ON THAT PLATFORM?

352
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,529

MERIT.

377
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,087
THROUGH MERIT.

378
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:20,358
THAT'S HAPPENING.

379
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:28,300
NEED IT.

380
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,570
SO WE STARTED THE WALL.

381
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,138
WE GOT $1.6 BILLION.

382
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,540
WE GOT ANOTHER $1.6 BILLION.

383
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,042
AND WE GOT A THIRD.

384
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,379
I WANT TO DO IT QUICK.

385
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,213
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS A LARGE

386
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:46,752
GROUP OF PEOPLE, THEY CALL IT A

387
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:49,721
CARAVAN, YOU KNOW HOW THE

388
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:50,455
CARAVAN STARTED?

389
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,925
DOES EVERYBODY KNOW WHAT THIS

390
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:53,225
MEANS, HUH?

391
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,626
I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAD

392
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,428
SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AND NOW

393
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,997
THEY'RE SAYING I THINK WE MADE A

394
00:19:58,997 --> 00:19:59,730
BIG MISTAKE.

395
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:01,266
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SEEING HOW

396
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:06,204
BAD IT IS, HOW PATHETIC IT IS,

397
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,407
HOW BAD OUR LAWS ARE, THEY MADE

398
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,374
A BIG MISTAKE.

399
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,343
SO AS THE CARAVAN -- AND LOOK,

400
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,979
THAT IS AN ASSAULT ON OUR

401
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:14,746
COUNTRY.

402
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,047
THAT'S AN ASSAULT.

403
00:20:16,047 --> 00:20:18,317
AND IN THAT CARAVAN, YOU HAVE

404
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:19,884
SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE.

405
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,752
YOU HAVE SOME VERY BAD PEOPLE.

406
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,455
AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO

407
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:24,021
OUR COUNTRY.

408
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:24,689
AND IT'S NOT.

409
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:26,558
AND I WAS JUST TALKING TO YOUR

410
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,326
GREAT GOVERNOR AND SENATORS AND

411
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:29,795
YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT YOUR

412
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:30,962
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO I'M GOING

413
00:20:30,962 --> 00:20:32,797
TO BE INTRODUCING IN A SECOND.

414
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:34,666
BUT I'M TALKING TO A LOT OF YOUR

415
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,268
PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOING TO FORM

416
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:39,638
A WALL, DIFFERENT KIND OF A WALL

417
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,306
UNTIL WE GET THE OTHER ONE

418
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:41,740
BUILT.

419
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,876
WE NEED A WALL BUILT FAST, FAST.

420
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:48,180
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.

421
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,748
WE DON'T HAVE BORDERS.

422
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,048
WE DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY.

423
00:20:51,048 --> 00:20:54,886
WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS.

424
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:58,290
AND TED, YOU PROBABLY SAW, DID A

425
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,360
BEAUTIFUL JOB IN STARING DOWN AN

426
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,197
ANGRY LEFT WING MOB IN OUR

427
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,798
RECENT SUPREME COURT BATTLE

428
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:13,438
VICTORY, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO

429
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,439
CALL IT.

430
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,542
HE WAS GREAT.

431
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,812
AND THANKS TO TED AND OUR OTHER

432
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:21,747
GREAT REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE WE

433
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,483
HAD NO HELP FROM THE OTHER SIDE

434
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,550
AS YOU KNOW.

435
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,586
WE NOW HAVE A BRAND NEW MEMBER

436
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,422
OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

437
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:40,432
COURT, JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH.

438
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,234
AND ALSO THIS IS SUCH AN HONOR,

439
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:44,069
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, YOU'VE HAD

440
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:44,703
MANY PRESIDENTS.

441
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,471
THEY NEVER GET TO PUT A JUSTICE

442
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,006
ON THE SUPREME COURT.

443
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,075
THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR A LONG

444
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:50,475
TIME.

445
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,142
THINK OF THIS.

446
00:21:51,142 --> 00:21:53,011
IT'S THE STORY OF OUR LIVES.

447
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,212
I'VE BEEN THERE LESS THAN TWO

448
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,282
YEARS AND I HAVE TWO OF THEM

449
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:03,422
BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE A FANTASTIC

450
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,390
NEW JUSTICE IN NEIL GORSUCH.

451
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:09,560
WE HAD HIM JUST APPROVED.

452
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,029
HE WAS JUST CONFIRMED.

453
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,999
AND WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF

454
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,335
CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES FOR THE

455
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,305
TIME THAT WE'VE BEEN IN OFFICE.

456
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:22,340
AND THAT WE FULLY EXPECT TO GO

457
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,543
TO THE AL TIME RECORD -- ALL

458
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,311
TIME RECORD.

459
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,312
AND PERCENTAGE WISE IT'S RIGHT

460
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,047
UP THERE AND WE'VE ONLY BEEN

461
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,349
HERE A SHORT -- OKAY, READY,

462
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,050
HERE'S A QUESTION.

463
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,120
PERCENTAGE WISE WHO HAS MORE

464
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,289
JUSTICES, FEDERAL JUDGES

465
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:39,391
APPOINTED, PERCENTAGE WISE THAN

466
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,625
ANY OTHER PRESIDENT?

467
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,161
WHO IS IT?

468
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:45,263
NO, MORE.

469
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,799
WHO APPOINTED THE HIGHEST

470
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:55,273
PERCENTAGE OF JUDGES?

471
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:55,607
NO.

472
00:22:55,607 --> 00:22:55,774
NO.

473
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:55,941
NO.

474
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:56,475
WASN'T HILLARY CLINTON.

475
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,110
NO, SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT,

476
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,377
REMEMBER?

477
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:02,147
NO, YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?

478
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,715
YOU'LL NEVER GUESS.

479
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,216
IT'S CALLED GEORGE WASHINGTON.

480
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,286
AND WE'RE AFTER GEORGE

481
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,388
WASHINGTON SO A VERY BIG THING.

482
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:11,790
NO, GEORGE WASHINGTON, WHY?

483
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,257
BECAUSE HE JUST STARTED.

484
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:14,759
HE DID 100%.

485
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,095
NOBODY'S EVER GOING TO BREAK

486
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:17,395
THAT RECORD.

487
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,631
NOBODY'S EVER GOING TO BREAK THE

488
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,533
RECORD OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.

489
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,500
GOOD OLD GEORGE.

490
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,504
HE NEVER TOLD A LIE.

491
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,671
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

492
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,705
GEORGE WASHINGTON, RIGHT?

493
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:29,007
HE NEVER TOLD A LIE.

494
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,010
BUT HE DID 100% OF THE JUDGES.

495
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:33,711
WE'LL NEVER BEAT THAT RECORD.

496
00:23:33,711 --> 00:23:36,114
BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSE.

497
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,984
WHAT THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS DID

498
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:43,255
TO JUSTICE KAVANAUGH AND HIS

499
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,825
BEAUTIFUL FAMILY IS A NATIONAL

500
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:47,092
DISGRACE.

501
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,095
THEY WERE ON A RUTHLESS MISSION

502
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,364
TO OBSTRUCT, RESIST, DELAY,

503
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,231
DEMOLISH, AND DESTROY WHICH IS

504
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:56,334
ALL THEY KNOW HOW TO DO.

505
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,437
THE FACT IS THEY'RE LOUSY

506
00:23:59,437 --> 00:23:59,871
POLITICIANS.

507
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,307
THEY HAVE HORRIBLE POLICY BUT

508
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,607
THEY STICK TOGETHER.

509
00:24:03,607 --> 00:24:05,644
THAT'S ONE GOOD THING.

510
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,012
THEY ALWAYS STICK TOGETHER.

511
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,780
OTHER THAN THAT THEY'RE NOT

512
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,448
DOING TOO WELL.

513
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:14,252
IF YOU WANT THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA

514
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:45,383
TO FINALLY INVESTIGATE -- BY THE

515
00:24:45,383 --> 00:25:13,144
WAY, DON'T WORRY, I DON'T LIKE

516
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:13,544
THEM EITHER.

517
00:25:13,544 --> 00:25:15,513
BUT LOOK AT THIS.

518
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:15,880
JUST LOOK.

519
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,648
HERE WE ARE.

520
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,216
WE'RE DOING A RALLY FOR TED.

521
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:18,816
AND IT'S GREAT.

522
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:21,252
WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

523
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:23,455
LOOK HOW MANY MADE IT.

524
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:25,090
THIS IS LIKE, IT'S LIKE THIS IS

525
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,858
THE ACADEMY AWARDS WHICH

526
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,927
ACTUALLY HAS GONE DOWN THE

527
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:29,194
TUBES.

528
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,195
I THINK WE DO MUCH BETTER.

529
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:32,163
LOOK HOW MANY.

530
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:33,598
LOOK HOW MANY.

531
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:38,002
LOOK AT THEM.

532
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:39,838
YOU RECOGNIZE MANY OF THOSE

533
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:43,208
HAPPY FACES BACK THERE?

534
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,510
I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM.

535
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,645
I KNOW EVERY ONE OF THEM.

536
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:52,650
AND 15% OF THEM ARE GREAT.

537
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,351
EVERY ONE.

538
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:59,424
I KNOW EVERY ONE.

539
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:04,162
BUT IF YOU WANT THE FAKE NEWS TO

540
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,630
FINALLY INVESTIGATE HILLARY

541
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:26,317
CLINTON, WE'LL JUST HAVE --

542
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:34,192
YEAH.

543
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,259
I DIDN'T DO IT.

544
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:36,260
I DIDN'T DO IT.

545
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,696
I DIDN'T DO IT.

546
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:42,133
SO IF YOU WANT THEM TO

547
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,069
INVESTIGATE, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO

548
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:47,405
NOMINATE HILLARY CLINTON TO THE

549
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:48,306
UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.

550
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:54,779
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

551
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,313
RIGHT?

552
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:59,784
LET'S SEE HOW SHE DOES.

553
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:01,352
IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAD TO GO

554
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:02,687
THROUGH WHAT HE WENT THROUGH,

555
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:04,289
AND HE'S A FINE MAN.

556
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,125
CAN YOU IMAGINE HILLARY UP

557
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:07,325
THERE?

558
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,394
THAT WOULD TAKE THREE TO FOUR

559
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:14,666
YEARS OF QUESTIONS.

560
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:17,001
AND STAKE IN THIS ELECTION IS

561
00:27:17,001 --> 00:27:18,570
WHETHER WE CONTINUE THE

562
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,804
EXTRAORDINARY PROSPERITY THAT

563
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,539
WE'VE ALL ACHIEVED OR WHETHER WE

564
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,842
LET THE RADICAL DEMOCRAT MOB

565
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:27,579
TAKE A GIANT WRECKING BALL AND

566
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:34,352
DESTROY OUR COUNTRY AND OUR

567
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:34,585
ECONOMY.

568
00:27:34,585 --> 00:27:36,054
THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE JUST FELL

569
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,056
TO THE LOWEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN

570
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:43,194
50 YEARS.

571
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,462
5-0.

572
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,030
HERE'S ONE THAT'S HARD TO BEAT

573
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,366
BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS

574
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,201
WORKING AT THIS MOMENT, THINK OF

575
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,670
IT, AT THIS MOMENT, WORKING

576
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:56,007
WORKING WORKING, THE NUMBER OF

577
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,574
AMERICANS WORKING HAS JUST

578
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:58,676
REACHED THE HIGHEST IN THE

579
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,778
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

580
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:08,386
ALL TIME HIGH.

581
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:10,121
WE HAVE ELIMINATED A RECORD

582
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,556
NUMBER OF JOB-KILLING

583
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:11,856
REGULATIONS.

584
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,625
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS OUR

585
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:16,361
COMPANIES ARE ALL COMING BACK.

586
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,061
REPUBLICANS PASSED THE BIGGEST

587
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:19,597
TAX CUT AND REFORM IN HISTORY

588
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:22,333
WITH MASSIVE TAX CUTS FOR THE

589
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,135
MIDDLE CLASS AND NOW WE'RE

590
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:33,745
ADDING 10% TO THOSE NUMBERS.

591
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:37,215
WE'VE SAVED YOUR FAMILY FARMS,

592
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,350
RANCHES, AND SMALL BUSINESSES

593
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,919
FROM THE ESTATE TAX ALSO KNOWN

594
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,792
AS THE DEATH TAX.

595
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:49,727
SO MOST OF YOU LOVE YOUR

596
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:49,994
CHILDREN.

597
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:50,995
SOME OF YOU DON'T.

598
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,597
BUT THE ONES THAT DON'T, DON'T

599
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,732
LISTEN TO ME BECAUSE THIS WON'T

600
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:54,999
MATTER.

601
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:55,733
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

602
00:28:55,733 --> 00:28:56,968
LEAVE IT ANYWAY.

603
00:28:56,968 --> 00:28:58,570
AND IF YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR

604
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,671
CHILDREN, AND IF YOUR CHILDREN

605
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,773
DIDN'T TREAT YOU GOOD, DON'T

606
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,140
LEAVE THEM ANYTHING.

607
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,543
GIVE IT TO CHARITY OR SOMEBODY

608
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:05,743
ELSE.

609
00:29:05,743 --> 00:29:07,512
BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHAT REALLY

610
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,380
WOULD LIKE YOUR SMALL

611
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,349
BUSINESSES, YOUR O FARMS, YOUR

612
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,918
-- YOUR FARMS, YOUR RANCHES LEFT

613
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,487
TO YOUR CHILDREN INSTEAD OF NOW

614
00:29:16,487 --> 00:29:18,990
HAVING YOUR CHILDRE GO OUT WHEN

615
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,026
YOU KICK THE BUCKET.

616
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:25,897
IT'S THEIR DAY THEN ABOUT TWO OR

617
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:28,867
THREE DAYS LATER THEY'RE HAPPY

618
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,335
AS -- NO FORGET IT.

619
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:32,937
INSTEAD OF HAVING THEM GO OUT

620
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,972
AND BORROW A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

621
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,674
OF MONEY TO PAY THE ESTATE TAX,

622
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:39,244
THEY DON'T HAVE TO BORROW

623
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:39,677
ANYTHING.

624
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:40,778
THERE'S NO TAX.

625
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,747
THERE'S NO TAX.

626
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:47,185
SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO -- TO ME

627
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,953
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

628
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:49,754
NOBODY EVEN TALKS ABOUT.

629
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:51,289
THAT WAS IN OUR TAX CUT.

630
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,058
A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESS, FARMS,

631
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,693
RANCHES, AND THERE'LL BE NO TAX.

632
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:57,862
SO THAT'S GREAT FOR YOUR

633
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:58,997
CHILDREN.

634
00:29:58,997 --> 00:30:00,398
ONLY IF YOU LOVE THEM.

635
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,969
ANYBODY IN HERE DOES NOT LOVE

636
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:12,377
THEIR CHILD?

637
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,978
ANYBODY?

638
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:14,645
TWO PEOPLE.

639
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:17,482
THAT'S NOT BAD.

640
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,317
MY ADMINISTRATION ALSO ENDED THE

641
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:21,318
HORRIBLE WAR ON AMERICAN ENERGY.

642
00:30:21,318 --> 00:30:27,891
SOMETHING YOU PEOPLE KNOW A LOT

643
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,627
ABOUT.

644
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:30,728
WE WENT THROUGH THE UNITED

645
00:30:30,728 --> 00:30:35,667
STATES FROM THE VERY UNFAIR,

646
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,701
ONE-SIDED PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD

647
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:41,205
WHICH WAS PUTTING US OUT OF

648
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:41,505
BUSINESS.

649
00:30:41,505 --> 00:30:44,542
ON DAY ONE I APPROVED THE

650
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:49,514
KEYSTONE AND THE DAKOTA ACCESS

651
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,481
PIPELINE.

652

654
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:54,018
DAY ONE.

655
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,787
THINK OF THAT.

656
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:56,020
DAY ONE.

657
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,555
THEY SPENT YEARS AND YEARS

658
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,657
TRYING TO GET THESE PIPELINES

659
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,425
BUILT.

00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,533
FACTOR OF TEN FOR YOUR PIPELINES

663
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,168

TEXAS TO GET THE OIL TO ITS

665
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:14,472
DESTINATION.

666
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:18,109
WE'RE SPEEDING IT UP.

667
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,879
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH.

00:31:21,879 --> 00:31:23,414
WITH TEXAS LEADING THE WAY,

669
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:25,683
THINK OF THIS ONE, THE UNITED

00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:40,698
THANK YOU.

676
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:45,502

WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE ENERGY

679
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,240
PRODUCER IN THE WORLD.

680
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,608
WHO WOULD THINK THAT?

681
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:53,211
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THE

682
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:54,077

IF THERE'S A PROBLEM WE LET THEM

689
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:01,786
IMMEDIATELY.

690
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:02,887
WE DON'T TAKE THEM 20 YEARS DOWN

WE LET THEM KNOW IMMEDIATELY

694
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,793
THERE WON'T BE A PROBLEM.

695
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:11,062
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN

696
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,098
60 YEARS AMERICA IS A NET

697
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:19,737
EXPORTER OF NATURAL GAS.

698
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:21,605
AND HERE'S GOOD NEWS FOR TEXAS.

699
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,574
GOOD NEWS FOR TEXAS.

700
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,611
BECAUSE JUST TODAY GERMANY'S

701
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,179
CHANCELLOR, ANGELA MERKEL, HAS

702
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:31,182
ANNOUNCED THAT HER COUNTRY WILL

703
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:34,218
NOW PURCHASE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

704
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:40,992
LNG, WHICH IS GREAT NEWS FOR

705
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:44,896
YOUR STATE.

706
00:32:44,896 --> 00:32:47,665
AND I TOLD ALL OF THE EUROPEAN

707
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:48,900
NATIONS, IT'S NOT FAIR.

708
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,235
WE HAVE ALL THESE HORRIBLE TRADE

709
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:55,340
IMBALANCES M THEY TAKE SUCH --

710
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:55,640
IMBALANCES.

711
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,374
THEY TAKE SUCH ADVANTAGE.

712
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:58,509
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP

713
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:01,178
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN.

714
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,747
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN

715
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:10,487
BECAUSE WE ARE PUTTING AMERICA

716
00:33:10,487 --> 00:33:17,628
FIRST.

717
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,564
WE'RE PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.

718
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,234
IT HASN'T HAPPENED IN A LOT OF

719
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:23,634
DECADES.

720
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:25,202
WE'RE PUTTING THEM FIRST.

721
00:33:25,202 --> 00:33:26,304
WE'RE TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES

722
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:33,577
FOR A CHANGE, FOLKS.

723
00:33:33,577 --> 00:33:34,278
THANK YOU.

724
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:37,381
I LIKE THAT GUY BUT NOT THAT

725
00:33:37,381 --> 00:33:38,149
MUCH.

726
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,550
NOT THAT MUCH.

727
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,519
BUT RADICAL DEMOCRATS WANT TO

728
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,424
TURN BACK THE CLOCK -- RULE OF

729
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:48,559
CORRUPT, POWER HUNGRY

730
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:48,859
GLOBALISTS.

731
00:33:48,859 --> 00:33:50,862
YOU KNOW WHAT A GLOBALIST IS,

732
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,062
RIGHT?

733
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,030
YOU KNOW WHAT A GLOBALIST IS.

734
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,232
A GLOBALIST IS A PERSON THAT

735
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,201
WANTS THE GLOBE TO DO WELL,

736
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,137
FRANKLY, NOT CARING ABOUT OUR

737
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,705
COUNTRY SO MUCH.

738
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,839
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

739
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,441
WE CAN'T HAVE THAT.

740
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,610
YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE A WORD, IT

741
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,511
SORT OF BECAME OLD FASHIONED.

742
00:34:07,511 --> 00:34:09,079
IT'S CALLED A NATIONALIST.

743
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:10,882
AND I SAY REALLY, WE'RE NOT

744
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,449
SUPPOSED TO USE THAT WORD.

745
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,351
YOU KNOW WHAT I AM?

746
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:17,855
I'M A NATIONALIST, OKAY?

747
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:21,759
I'M A NATIONALIST.

748
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:22,092
NATIONALIST.

749
00:34:22,092 --> 00:34:22,659
NOTHING MORE.

750
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,828
USE THAT WORD.

751
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:37,742
USE THAT WORD.

752
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,746
THEY REPORTED YESTERDAY THAT

753
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,149
DONALD TRUMP IS VERY UNPOPULAR

754
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,484
WITH OTHER NATIONS.

755
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,418
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR

756
00:34:48,418 --> 00:34:51,755
PRESIDENTS IN THE HISTORY OF

757
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:52,456
POLLING.

758
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:55,326
AND I SAID NO.

759
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,795
I SAID OF COURSE I'M UNPOPULAR

760
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:00,231
WITH FOREIGN NATIONS.

761
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:01,399
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT LETTING THEM

762
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:06,303
RIP US OFF ANYMORE, FOLKS.

763
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:06,737
OKAY?

764
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,906
THEY MEANT IT TO BE BAD.

765
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,374
OR THE FAKE NEWS THEY MEANT IT

766
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:11,575
TO BE BAD.

767
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:14,145
DONALD TRUMP VERY UNPOPULAR WITH

768
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:14,478
OTHER NATIONS.

769
00:35:14,478 --> 00:35:16,113
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAD?

770
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:19,550
IT WAS 70% AGAINST AND 30% FOR.

771
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:21,652
I SAID WHO IS THE 30%?

772
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,955
WHY WOULD THEY EVER WANT TO VOTE

773
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,488
FOR ME?

774
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:26,791
BECAUSE HONESTLY, WE'RE TREATING

775
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,625
EVERYBODY GOOD.

776
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,927
WE'RE HELPING PEOPLE.

777
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,362
WE'RE PROTECTING PEOPLE.

778
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:32,797
WHEN WE PROTECT WITH OUR

779
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,498
MILITARY, THE GREATEST IN THE

00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,200
WOORLD, AND NOW IT'S -- WORLD,

781
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,636
AND NOW IT'S GREATER THAN IT'S

782
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,571
EVER BEEN, WE HAVE TO BE

783
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,907
REIMBURSED FOR THAT PROTECTION.

784
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,942
WE'RE PROTECTING THE WEALTHIEST

785
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,710
NATIONS IN THE WORLD.

786
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,412
AND WE'RE SUBSIDIZING THEM.

787
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:50,547
AND THEN THEY BEAT US ON TRADE.

788
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:51,915
THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US.

789
00:35:51,915 --> 00:35:54,218
SO THOSE DAYS ARE OVER.

790
00:35:54,218 --> 00:36:00,791
YOU'RE SEEING IT HAPPENING FAST.

791
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,127
THE MOST UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT.

792
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,462
THINK OF THAT.

793
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:05,196
MOST UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT.

794
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:07,064
BUT I'M ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR

795
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,766
PRESIDENTS IN THIS COUNTRY AND

796
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:09,767
THAT'S GOOD.

797
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,268
THAT'S JUST GOOD.

798
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:17,208
IN OUR COUNTRY.

799
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,243
COUPLE OF POLLS CAME OUT TODAY

800
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,111
THAT WERE VERY GOOD.

801
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,580
AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PUT THEM

802
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:22,847
ON.

803
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,115
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ANNOUNCE

804
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:24,315
THEM.

805
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,683
AND THEY PAID FOR THE POLLS.

806
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:29,253
WE HAVE A NEW POLL OUT, LET ME

807
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:36,127
SEE, OH, LET'S GET TO ANOTHER

808
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:36,460
SUBJECT.

809
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,095
FAKE NEWS.

810
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:42,099
THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO REPLACE

811
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,100
FREEDOM WITH SOCIALISM.

812
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,705
THEY WANT TO REPLACE TEXAS

813
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:52,409
VALUES WITH NANCY PELOSI VALUES.

814
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:53,844
AND THEY WANT TO REPLACE THE

815
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:58,082
RULE OF LAW WITH THE RULE OF THE

816
00:36:58,082 --> 00:36:59,116
MOB.

817
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,317
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

818
00:37:00,317 --> 00:37:03,654
AND THE DEMOCRATS WOULD RATHER

819
00:37:03,654 --> 00:37:05,389
DESTROY AMERICAN COMMUNITIES

820
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,091
THAN DEFEND AMERICA'S BORDERS.

821
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:10,093
I'M NOT GOING TO LET IT HAPPEN.

822
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:15,366
GOT TO VOTE FOR TED CRUZ.

823
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:18,602
DEMOCRATS -- THE DEMOCRATS

824
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:21,839
ARE A BIG RISK TO THE AMERICAN

825
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,875
FAMILY AND OUR COUNTRY CANNOT

826
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,278
AFFORD TO TAKE THOSE KIND OF

827
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,479
RISKSMENT WE CAN'T.

828
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,847
THIS WILL BE -- RISKS.

829
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:30,114
WE CAN'T.

830
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,818
THIS WILL BE THE ELECTION OF THE

831
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,952
CARAVAN, KAVANAUGH, LAW AND

832
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,088
ORDER, TAX CUTS, AND COMMON

833
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:37,521
SENSE.

834
00:37:37,521 --> 00:38:12,123
THAT'S WHAT IT IS, COMMON SENSE.

835
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,358
TED EASE OPPONENT IN THIS RACE

836
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:16,460
-- TED'S OPPONENT IN THIS RACE

837
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,897
IS A STONE COLD PHONY NAMED

838
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:21,965
ROBERT FRANCIS O'ROURKE.

839
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:28,039
SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS BETO.

840
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:30,307
AND HE PRETENDS TO BE A MODERATE

841
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:32,710
BUT HE'S ACTUALLY A RADICAL OPEN

842
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,977
BORDERS LEFT WINGER.

843
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,146
THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

844
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,781
AND I KNOW TEXAS WELL.

845
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:38,582
DON'T FORGET.

846
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:41,218
THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE YOU ON

847
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:43,354
ELECTION NIGHT THAT TEXAS IS IN

848
00:38:43,354 --> 00:38:43,554
PLAY.

849
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,087
I KEPT HEARING.

850
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:48,359
I GO TO A THING AND I --

851
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,561
REMEMBER THE LINES I'D HAVE FOR

852
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:51,061
THE SPEECHES?

853
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:53,798
I HATE TO TELL YOU, I THINK THE

854
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:54,765
LINES ARE BIGGER TONIGHT THAN

855
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,267
THEY WERE TWO YEARS AGO.

856
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,535
YOU KNOW WHY?

857
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:59,169
BECAUSE I PRODUCED.

858
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:00,737
I PRODUCED.

859
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:06,711
BECAUSE I PRODUCED.

860
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,579
NO, THE LINES ARE BIGGER

861
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:08,812
TONIGHT.

862
00:39:08,812 --> 00:39:09,546
AND IT'S EASIER.

863
00:39:09,546 --> 00:39:11,515
YOU KNOW, TWO YEARS AGO, TWO AND

864
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,250
A HALF YEARS AGO I HAVE TO GET

865
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,220
UP AND SAY WE WILL GIVE YOU TAX

866
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:16,453
CUTS.

867
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:21,492
WE WILL GIVE YOU REGULAR -- WE

868
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:22,993
WILL CUT REGULATIONS.

869
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,161
BUT IT WAS JUST WORDS.

870
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,662
NOW I CAN DO IT.

871
00:39:25,662 --> 00:39:26,664
THIS IS EASY.

872
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,166
IN FACT, SOME OF THOSE GUYS IF

873
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:30,568
THEY DON'T QUESTION IT WILL SAY

874
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,503
THAT I PRODUCED MORE THAN I

875
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:38,108
PROMISED WHICH IS TRUE, WHICH IS

876
00:39:38,108 --> 00:39:38,409
TRUE.

877
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:38,676
ACCURATE.

878
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:40,411
BUT O'ROURKE VOTED AGAINST YOUR

879
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:41,645
TAX CUTS.

880
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,349
AND HE WENT AGAINST TEXAS OIL

881
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,785
WORKERS WITH THE JOB-KILLING

882
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:50,221
REGULATIONS AND TAXES THAT WERE

883
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,523
REALLY REALLY HURTING THOSE JOBS

884
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,159
AND THOSE COMPANIES.

885
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:57,361
O'ROURKE SUPPORTS A SOCIALIST

886
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,696
TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE.

887
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:00,431
YOU'RE GOING TO TRIPLE YOUR

888
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,566
TAXES AND IT WON'T BE ENOUGH.

889
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,235
AND IT'LL BE LOUSY HEALTH CARE.

890
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,605
YOU'LL END UP WAITING FOR FIVE

891
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:08,973
WEEKS TO SEE A DOCTOR.

892
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:11,008
AND I HEARD TED SAY JUST BEFORE

893
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,711
I WENT ON, BUT TO ME THIS IS A

894
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,312
BEAUTY, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW OF

895
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,780
ANYBODY THAT'S EARNED THIS

896
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,081
RATING.

897
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,016
HE GOT AN F FROM THE NRA.

898
00:40:19,016 --> 00:40:22,453
ONE OF THE FEW.

899
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,689
YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT AN F

900
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:25,889
MEANS.

901
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:28,893
AN F MEANS HE WANTS TO TAKE AWAY

902
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:29,160
YOUR GUNS.

903
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,594
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS.

904
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,096
I NEVER EVEN HEARD OF AN F.

905
00:40:33,096 --> 00:40:35,498
LOUIE, DID YOU HEAR OF AN F?

906
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:36,933
I NEVER HEARD IT.

907
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:40,270
DO WE LOVE LOUIE?

908
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,805
DO WE LOVE LOUIE?

909
00:40:41,805 --> 00:40:43,907
LOOK AT HIM.

910
00:40:43,907 --> 00:40:45,209
LOUIE GOMER, WE LOVE HIM.

911
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,811
I DON'T KNOW WHAT LOUIE'S RATING

912
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:50,948
IS BUT I'D ASSUME IT'S ABOUT A

913
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:52,016
WHAT, A PLUS?

914
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,018
A PLUS PLUS.

915
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:54,218
LOUIE.

916
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,720
I LOVE PEOPLE THAT ARE GUTS.

917
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,855
HE HAS GUTS.

918
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,623
HE HAS GUTS.

919
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,323
GETS UP THERE.

920
00:41:00,323 --> 00:41:00,991
THEY DEFEND YOU.

921
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,527
AND THEY DEFEND YOUR SECOND

922
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:03,794
AMENDMENT.

923
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,429
AND IF TED DOESN'T WIN, YOUR

924
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,531
SECOND AMENDMENT'S GOING TO BE

925
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,465
IN TROUBLE.

926
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:08,798
BIG TROUBLE.

927
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:09,567
REMEMBER THAT.

928
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,268
O'ROURKE VOTED AGAINST THE

929
00:41:11,268 --> 00:41:11,935
BORDER WALL.

930
00:41:11,935 --> 00:41:19,243
THAT'S A GOOD THING TO VOTE.

931
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:23,914
HE VOTED FOR OBAMA AMNESTY.

932
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:24,247
OBAMA AMNESTY.

933
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:26,617
O'ROURKE EVEN VOTED TO SHIELD

934
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,352
MS-13 GANG MEMBERS FROM

935
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:28,652
DEPORTATION.

936
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,689
HE DOESN'T WANT TO DEPORT THEM.

937
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:35,025
HE SAYS THEY'RE PEOPLE.

938
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:35,392
THEY'RE PEOPLE.

939
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,861
THEY CARVE YOU UP WITH A KNIFE

940
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:38,862
BUT THEY'RE PEOPLE.

941
00:41:38,862 --> 00:41:41,265
O'ROURKE VOTED IN FAVOR OF

942
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,266
SANCTUARY

943
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,301
SANCTUARY CITIES THAT RESULT IN

944
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:48,172
THE DEATHS OF COUNTLESS

945
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:48,439
AMERICANS.

946
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,108
TODAY'S DEMOCRAT PARTY WOULD

947
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,644
RATHER PROTECT CRIMINAL ALIENS

948
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,113
THAN AMERICAN CITIZENS WHICH IS

949
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,048
WHY THE DEMOCRATS MUST BE VOTED

950
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,217
OUT OF OFFICE.

951
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:07,424
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES.

952
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,427
A VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT THIS

953
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,998
NOVEMBER IS A VOTE TO SURRENDER

954
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,266
CONGRESS TO NANCY PELOSI, CRYING

955
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:19,637
CHUCK SCHUMER, THE GREAT MAXINE

956
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:20,437
WATERS.

957
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:26,476
THAT'S A BEAUTY.

958
00:42:26,476 --> 00:42:27,244
MAXINE WATERS.

959
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,079
YOU GET THAT ONE?

960
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,447
YOU GET THAT?

961
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:30,680
MAXINE.

962
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,519
SHE'S GOING BE IN CHARGE OF YOUR

963
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,320
FINANCES.

964
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,553
MAXINE.

965
00:42:36,553 --> 00:42:38,722
GOOD OLD MAXINE.

966
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,525
LOW IX INDIVIDUAL -- IQ

967
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:42,059
INDIVIDUAL.

968
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,293
SHE'S LOW IQ.

969
00:42:43,293 --> 00:42:46,029
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

970
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:53,237
SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN.

971
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,572
THE MAYOR WHO DID ONE OF THE

972
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:59,376
WORST JOBS OF ANY MAYOR OTHER

973
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:01,946
THAN THE GUY RUNNING FOR

974
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:02,512
GOVERNOR IN FLORIDA.

975
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:05,415
HE WAS A HORRIBLE MAYOR TOO.

976
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:06,817
CORY BOOKER.

977
00:43:06,817 --> 00:43:08,685
HE DESTROYED WHAT HE DID.

978
00:43:08,685 --> 00:43:12,756
HE WAS SO BAD RUNNING NEWARK.

979
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:18,462
AND A SAD THING HAPPENED LAST

980
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:18,662
WEEK.

981
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:21,532
BECAUSE ELIZABETH WARREN WAS

982
00:43:21,532 --> 00:43:23,567
EXPOSED AS BEING A TOTAL FRAUD.

983
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,236
AND I CAN NO LONGER CALL HER

984
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,338
POCAHONTAS BECAUSE SHE HAS NO

985
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:29,172
INDIAN BLOOD.

986
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:39,850
I CAN'T CALL HER.

987
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:43,520
I CAN'T CALL HER POCAHONTAS.

988
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,588
SHE DOESN'T QUALIFY.

989
00:43:45,588 --> 00:43:47,825
SHE HAS -- I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR

990
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,561
A LONG TIME, I'VE BEEN SAYING IT

991
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:51,795
FOR A YEAR AND A HALF.

992
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,264
I SAID I HAVE MORE INDIAN BLOOD

993
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,767
THAN SHE HAS AND I HAVE NONE.

994
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,102
I HAVE NONE.

995
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,469
BUT I HAVE MORE THAN SHE HAS.

996
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:02,606
BUT I CAN'T USE THE NAME

997
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:03,039
POCAHONTAS ANYMORE.

998
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:05,209
BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND I WILL

999
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,010
ANYWAY, IS THAT OKAY?

1000
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,581
WE GOT TO KEEP HER DOWN.

1001
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:13,016
BUT IN THIS ELECTION, THE PEOPLE

1002
00:44:13,016 --> 00:44:15,886
OF TEXAS ARE GOING TO MAKE A

1003
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:23,127
GIANT AND BEAUTIFUL STAND.

1004
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,796
YOU'RE GOING TO ELECT A

1005
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,965
REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND EVEN

1006
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,100
THEY'RE HAVING A LITTLE PROBLEM.

1007
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,268
THEY'RE GETTING A LITTLE

1008
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:31,635
NERVOUS, RIGHT?

1009
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,036
REMEMBER ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

1010
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:33,337
RIGHT?

1011
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:36,440
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

1012
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,474
BLUE WAVE.

1013
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:37,640
OH.

1014
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,209
YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THE BLUE

1015
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:39,476
WAVE.

1016
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:41,712
YOU'RE NOT HEARING SO MUCH.

1017
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:43,614
THE BLUE WAVE IS BEING

1018
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:44,848
DISSIPATED A LITTLE BIT.

1019
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,017
I DON'T HEAR THEM -- ARE YOU

1020
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:51,555
GUYS STILL TALKING ABOUT THE

1021
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:52,522
BLUE WAVE?

1022
00:44:52,522 --> 00:44:53,924
THE BLUE WAVE.

1023
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:54,991
THAT'S COMING, RIGHT?

1024
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:55,559
BLUE WAVE.

1025
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,994
YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT TOO

1026
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:57,194
MUCH.

1027
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,061
LET ME TELL YOU.

1028
00:44:58,061 --> 00:45:00,063
YOU GOT TO GET OUT AND VOTE.

1029
00:45:00,063 --> 00:45:02,232
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS?

1030
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,101
THE PARTY THAT HAS THE

1031
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:05,936
PRESIDENCY, I DON'T KNOW WHY, I

1032
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,905
GUESS YOU GET A LITTLE SEDATE, I

1033
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:09,606
GUESS YOU GET A LITTLE

1034
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,040
SOMETHING, WHO KNOWS.

1035
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,910
YOU LOSE SOMETHING, I DON'T

1036
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:13,110
KNOW.

1037
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:17,014
BUT I THINK TWO TIMES SINCE THE

1038
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,149
GREAT DEPRESSION IT WAS A

1039
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:19,583
POSITIVE.

1040
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,752
BUT NOBODY EVER HAD THE

1041
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,554
CONDITION OF HAVING PRODUCED THE

1042
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,323
GREATEST ECONOMY IN THE HISTORY

1043
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:30,060
OF OUR COUNTRY, RIGHT?

1044
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,294
NOBODY.

1045
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:31,662
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WOULD

1046
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:35,065
WE LOSE THE HOUSE?

1047
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,967
BUT HISTORICALLY SO HISTORY'S

1048
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,502
AGAINST US, BUT THE FACTS ARE

1049
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:39,703
ALL WITH US.

1050
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,239
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND VOTE.

1051
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,172
EARLY VOTING, REMEMBER.

1052
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:45,142
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DO GREAT

1053
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,377
WITH THE HOUSE AND FANTASTIC

1054
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,580
WITH THE SENATE SO THAT WE CAN

1055
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:57,588
KEEP MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

1056
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:00,424
AND YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE

1057
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:00,691
CHANGING.

1058
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:03,293
I LOVE THIS -- I HATE THIS --

1059
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,794
LET ME ASK YOUR ADVICE.

1060
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:06,062
TEXAS, YOU'RE SMART.

1061
00:46:06,062 --> 00:46:06,796
YOU'RE TOUGH.

1062
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:08,165
WE HAVE MAKE AMERICA GREAT

1063
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:08,365
AGAIN.

1064
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:09,933
I THINK IT HAS TO BE THE

1065
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,469
GREATEST SLOGAN IN THE HISTORY

1066
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,336
OF POLITICS.

1067
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:13,537
RIGHT?

1068
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:15,138
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

1069
00:46:15,138 --> 00:46:17,340
WHAT DID SHE HAVE SOME STUPID

1070
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:22,579
SLOGAN LIKE STAY TOGETHER?

1071
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,014
AND THEN WHEN I KNOCKED HER --

1072
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,416
OR WAS IT LIKE STAY WITH ME?

1073
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,952
AND THEN I GOT UP AND SAID SEE?

1074
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,388
THAT'S ALL SHE CAN TALK ABOUT IS

1075
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:31,621
HERSELF.

1076
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:33,824
SO THEY PAID $1 MILLION FOR THAT

1077
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,425
SLOGAN AND SHE CHANGED IT THE

1078
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:37,361
NEXT MORNING BECAUSE IT WAS A

1079
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:37,628
DISASTER.

1080
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:37,961
STAY WITH ME.

1081
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,196
THEY DIDN'T DO THAT.

1082
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,331
THEY DECIDED NOT TO.

1083
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:43,400
SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

1084
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,004
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, BUTúN-

1085
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:48,238
WE'RE RUNNING, WE'RE DOING GOOD.

1086
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:53,176
YOU KNOW WE'VE CREATED 11.7 --

1087
00:46:53,176 --> 00:46:55,745
$1.7 TRILLION -- $11.7 TRILLION.

1088
00:46:55,745 --> 00:46:58,048
AND REMEMBER, WE'RE HITTING

1089
00:46:58,048 --> 00:46:58,982
CHINA HARD, WE'RE HITTING

1090
00:46:58,982 --> 00:46:59,649
EVERYONE HARD.

1091
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:01,318
WE'RE DOING THESE TRADE DEALS.

1092
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,120
WHEN THEY ALL KICK IN YOU'LL SEE

1093
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,821
NUMBERS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T

1094
00:47:04,821 --> 00:47:05,289
BELIEVE.

1095
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,692
BUT WE'VE CREATED $11.7

1096
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:08,958
TRILLION.

1097
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:09,960
OTHER COUNTRIES, CHINA, YOU'VE

1098
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,229
NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE WITH

1099
00:47:12,229 --> 00:47:12,429
CHINA.

1100
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:13,796
REMEMBER IT WAS ALWAYS CHINA'S

1101
00:47:13,796 --> 00:47:15,899
DOING SO GREAT.

1102
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,401
CHINA, CHINA, EVERYTHING IS

1103
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:17,768
CHINA.

1104
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,669
WELL WHAT ABOUT US?

1105
00:47:19,669 --> 00:47:21,471
WE'RE DOWN.

1106
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,341
WE'RE NOT DOWN ANYMORE FOLKS.

1107
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:26,810
WE'RE WAY UP.

1108
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:35,084
WE'RE WAY UP.

1109
00:47:35,084 --> 00:47:41,325
WAY UP.

1110
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:46,763
AND BY THE WAY -- AND SINCE OUR

1111
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:48,832
ELECTION WE'VE GONE UP ALMOST

1112
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,767
50%.

1113
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:52,769
THINK OF IT $11.7 TRILLION WE

1114
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:53,170
CREATED.

1115
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,437
CHINA'S LOST ABOUT $20 TRILLION.

1116
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:55,972
WE WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY.

1117
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:58,175
WE WANT THEM TO DO WELL.

1118
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:00,410
BUT THEY HAVE TO TREAT US

1119
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:00,643
FAIRLY.

1120
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:02,011
THEY HAVEN'T TREATED US FAIRLY.

1121
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:02,846
AND THEY WILL.

1122
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:07,684
THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL GREAT

1123
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,053

00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:09,012
THEY'RE OVER HERE.

1309
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:10,647
IT'S HARD WHEN YOU HAVE 22,000

1310
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:14,651
PEOPLE IN A ROOM IT'S HARD TO

1311
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:18,455
FIND ONE PERSON EVEN WHEN HE'S

1312
00:54:18,455 --> 00:54:18,722
TALL.

1313
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:22,859
AND ANOTHER TALL GUY WHO IS AN

1314
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,494
INCREDIBLE SENATOR, HE

1315
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:26,830
REPRESENTS YOU SO WELL.

1316
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,465
HE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING FOR YOU.

1317
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,867
AND HE WAS THE ONE THAT ASKED

1318
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:37,574
DIANNE FEINSTEIN DID YOU LEAK?

1319
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:37,874
REMEMBER?

1320
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,442
AND SHE WENT HUH.

1321
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:43,880
SO HE WAS THE ONE.

1322
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,648
HE SAID, LOOKS OVER TO HER,

1323
00:54:45,648 --> 00:54:47,617
REMEMBER, DURING THE HEARINGS,

1324
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,085
THOSE HORRIBLE HEARINGS WHERE

1325
00:54:49,085 --> 00:54:50,820
THEY WERE SO NASTY AND HORRIBLE

1326
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,155
TO A GREAT GENTLEMAN WHO'S GOING

1327
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:54,089
TO GO DOWN AS ONE OF OUR

1328
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:58,395
GREATEST SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

1329
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:58,695
EVER?

1330
00:54:58,695 --> 00:55:00,964
HE GOES OUT AND HE GOES, HE'S ON

1331
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,699
THE COMMITTEE, AND HE GOES, DID

1332
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:03,900
YOU LEAK?

1333
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:06,469
AND SHE WENT OH, WHAT, NO.

1334
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,472
WAIT A MINUTE, LET ME CHECK.

1335
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:13,943
DID WE LEAK?

1336
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,879
NO, WE DIDN'T LEAK.

1337
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:16,046
OH.

1338
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:16,279
UH, NO.

1339
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:17,781
THAT WAS THE WORST BODY

1340
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:18,748
LANGUAGE.

1341
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:25,754
SHE WAS SO GUILTY OF LEAKING.

1342
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:27,324
SHE LEAKED.

1343
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,258
JOHN CORNEN WAS GREAT.

1344
00:55:29,258 --> 00:55:32,762
HE WAS GREAT DURING THE

1345
00:55:32,762 --> 00:55:33,029
HEARINGS.

1346
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:45,542
STAND UP JOHN YOU SURPRISED HER,

1347
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:45,742
RIGHT?

1348
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:47,977
SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE HECK

1349
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:48,378
HAPPENED.

1350
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,180
YOU SURPRISED HER WITH THAT

1351
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,913
BEAUTIFUL TEXAS ACCIDENT.

1352
00:55:50,913 --> 00:55:53,516
ALWAYS A GREAT JOB, NOT JUST

1354
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,385
ALWAYS A GREAT JOB.

1355
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,421
AND YOU HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL

1356
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,657
WHO DOESN'T STOP.

1357
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,557
HE'S TOUGH.

1358
00:56:01,557 --> 00:56:02,258
HE'S SMART.

1359
00:56:02,258 --> 00:56:06,629
HE COLLECTS MORE MONEY FOR THIS

1360
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:06,829

1528
01:02:28,344 --> 01:02:29,979
WE BELIEVE THAT SCHOOLS SHOULD

1529
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:33,583
TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO BE PROUD

1530
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,652

1531
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:44,193

WE KNOW THAT FAITH IN FAMILY,

1536
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,845

1537
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:06,782
ARE THE TRUE CENTER OF AMERICAN

1538
01:03:06,782 --> 01:03:08,150
LIFE.

1539
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,383
SO TRUE.

1540
01:03:08,383 --> 01:03:12,355
AND ABOVE ALL ELSE WE KNOW THIS,

1541
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:15,958
IN AMERICA WE DON'T WORSHIP

1542
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:16,459
GOVERNMENT.

1543
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:24,467
WE WORSHIP GOD.

1544
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,736

1546
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,105
STATE OF TEXAS.

1547
01:03:30,105 --> 01:03:32,541
IN THIS ELECTION YOU CAN SEND A

1548
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:35,678
MESSAGE TO THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS

1549
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:42,285

1550
01:03:42,285 --> 01:03:47,189
VOTE FOR TED CRUZ AND VOTE

1551
01:03:47,189 --> 01:03:48,024
REPUBLICAN.

1552
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:48,824
A FUTURE UNDER DEMOCRATIC MOB

1553
01:03:48,824 --> 01:03:52,595
RULE WOULD BE A TOTAL

1554
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:53,029
CATASTROPHE.

1555
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:54,864
DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS HAVE

1556
01:03:54,864 --> 01:03:56,732
ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR A

1557
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:58,334
SOCIALIST TAKEOVER OF HEALTH

1558
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,002
CARE THAT WOULD ELIMINATE THE

1559
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:02,805
PRIVATE INSURANCE OF MORE THAN

1560
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:04,940
15 MILLION TEXANS.

1561
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:08,511
THE DEMOCRAT PLAN WOULD DESTROY

1562
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:10,646
MEDICARE AND TERMINATE MEDICARE

1563
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,449
ADVANTAGE FOR 1.4 MILLION TEXAS

01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:16,252
SENIORS WHO DEPEND ON IT.

REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT

1566
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,089
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS

1567
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:23,159
WHO HAVE EARNED IT AND WHO HAVE

1568
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:27,963
PAID FOR IT FOR A LONG TIME.

1569
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:30,666
AND REPUBLICANS WILL ALWAYS

1570
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,568
PROTECT AMERICANS WITH

1571
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:33,602
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.

1572
01:04:33,602 --> 01:04:38,741
WE PROTECT YOU.

1573
01:04:38,741 --> 01:04:41,510
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS, RIGHT?

1574
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:43,346
THE DEMOCRAT PLAN TO DESTROY

1575
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,348
AMERICAN HEALTH CARE INCLUDES

1576
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:49,552
FREE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION

1577
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,886

EVERY TIME I SAY IT THE FAKE

NEWS SAYS -- I GOT SO MANY

1593
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:29,859

1596
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:38,633

THE ONLY THING YOU DON'T HAVE TO

1601
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:48,744
DO IT FOR IS WHEN YOU VOTE.

1602
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:50,746
NOT GOING TO BE THAT WAY.

1603
01:05:50,746 --> 01:05:51,447
VOTER ID.

1604
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,482
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE WE SHOULD

1605
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,184
PROTECT PUBLIC BENEFITS FOR

1606
01:05:55,184 --> 01:06:00,623
TRULY NEEDY AMERICANS, NOT FOR

1607
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:01,023
ILLEGAL ALIENS.

1608
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:03,726
AS WE SPEAK, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY

1609
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:09,131
IS OPENLY ENCOURAGING MILLIONS

1610
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:11,667
OF ILLEGAL ALIENS TO BREAK OUR

1611
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,804
LAWS, OVERWHELM OUR BORDERS, AND

1612
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:17,472
OVERWHELM OUR NATION.

1613
01:06:17,472 --> 01:06:18,774
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE LAUNCHED AN

1614
01:06:18,774 --> 01:06:20,409
ASSAULT ON THE SECURITY OF OUR

1615
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,979
NATION AND THE SAFETY OF EVERY

1616
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:23,346
SINGLE AMERICAN.

1617
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:25,514
THE CRISIS ON OUR BORDER RIGHT

1618
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:30,119
NOW AS WE SPEAK IS THE SOLE

1619
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:33,322
RESULT OF DEMOCRAT LAWS AND

1620
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,558
ACTIVISTS, DEMOCRAT JUDGES THAT

1621
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:38,694
PREVENT US FROM RETURNING

1622
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:39,261
ILLEGAL ALIENS FROM CENTRAL

1623
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:42,831
AMERICA AND ALL OVER THE WORLD.

1624
01:06:42,831 --> 01:06:49,505
IT'S CALLED CATCH AND RELEASE.

1625
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,474
YOU KNOW WHAT CATCH AND RELEASE

1626
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:52,207
IS, RIGHT?

1627
01:06:52,207 --> 01:06:54,076
YOU'VE GOT THESE GREAT PEOPLE

1628
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:55,177
FROM BORDER PATROL.

1629
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,613
THESE ARE GREAT PEOPLE.

1630
01:06:57,613 --> 01:07:00,449
I.C.E., BORDER PATROL, THESE ARE

1631
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:02,151
INCREDIBLE PEOPLE.

1632
01:07:02,151 --> 01:07:02,418
TOUGH JOB.

1633
01:07:02,418 --> 01:07:04,453
THEY CATCH THEM AND THEN THEY

1634
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,154
RELEASE THEM.

1635
01:07:05,154 --> 01:07:07,056
AND THEY SAY, YOU HAVE TO COME

1636
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,824
BACK FOR A COURT CASE.

1637
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,359
THEY JUST PUT THEIR FOOT OVER.

1638
01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:11,694
IMMEDIATELY THEY TOUCH OUR LAND.

1639
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,262
YOU HAVE TO COME BACK IN TWO

1640
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:15,097
YEARS FOR A COURT CASE.

1641
01:07:15,097 --> 01:07:18,367
WELL, NUMBER ONE, THEY NEVER

1642
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,468
COME BACK.

1643
01:07:19,468 --> 01:07:20,302
3%.

1644
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:23,438
AND I DON'T BELIEVE THE THREE.

1645
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:25,674
WE RELEASE THEM INTO OUR COUNTRY

1646
01:07:25,674 --> 01:07:26,509
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE

1647
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:27,009
DEMOCRATS WANT.

1648
01:07:27,009 --> 01:07:28,477
AND THEN A LOT OF BAD THINGS

1649
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,645
HAPPEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

1650
01:07:30,645 --> 01:07:34,183
THE DEMOCRATS DON'T CARE WHAT

1651
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:35,651
THEIR EXTREMIST IMMIGRATION

1652
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:37,019
AGENDA WILL DO TO YOUR

1653
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,420
NEIGHBORHOODS, TO YOUR

1654
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:39,921
HOSPITALS, OR TO YOUR SCHOOLS.

1655
01:07:39,921 --> 01:07:43,159
THEY DON'T CARE THAT THE MASS

1656
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,693
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION WILL TOTALLY

1657
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:47,997
BANKRUPT OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE ALL

1658
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:50,332
THE DEMOCRATS CARE ABOUT IS

1659
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,934
REGAINING POWER NO MATTER HOW

1660
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:54,403
THEY HAVE TO GO ABOUT DOING IT.

1661
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:56,472
ALL THE WITCH HUNTS NO MATTER

1662
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:58,474
WHAT THEY DO THEY JUST WANT TO

1663
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,074
GAIN POWER.

1664
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:04,379
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM

1665
01:08:04,379 --> 01:08:05,447
GAIN POWER.

1666
01:08:05,447 --> 01:08:06,882
AND THAT'S WHY THE DEMOCRATS ALL

1667
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:10,386
SUPPORT CATCH AND RELEASE.

1668
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:12,621
THAT'S WHY THEY SUPPORT VISA

1669
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:12,988
LOTTERY.

1670
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,323
YOU KNOW WHAT VISA LOTTERY IS?

1671
01:08:15,323 --> 01:08:17,259
COUNTRIES PUT NAMES IN A BATCH

1672
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,060
AND YOU PICK THEM.

1673
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:20,229
YOU PICK THEM.

1674
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:21,497
YOU KEEP PICKING THEM.

1675
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:23,532
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT NOTHING BUT

1676
01:08:23,532 --> 01:08:25,234
PROBLEMS BECAUSE YOU THINK THOSE

1677
01:08:25,234 --> 01:08:27,069
COUNTRIES ARE PUTTING THEIR

1678
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:27,303
FINEST?

1679
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:28,103
I DON'T THINK SO.

1680
01:08:28,103 --> 01:08:30,872
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO DISPOSE OF

1681
01:08:30,872 --> 01:08:31,240
THEIR PROBLEMS.

1682
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,140
VISA LOTTERY.

1683
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:35,477
AND THEN YOU HAVE CHAIN

1684
01:08:35,477 --> 01:08:35,743
MIGRATION.

1685
01:08:35,743 --> 01:08:38,214
A GUY COMES IN AS AN EXAMPLE

1686
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,215
WEST SIDE HIGHWAY IN MANHATTAN.

1687
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:41,916
THAT'S WHERE I AM.

1688
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:43,819
BEAUTIFUL PARK.

1689
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:44,319
BURTFUL HIGHWAY.

1690
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,587
-- BEAUTIFUL HIGHWAY.

1691
01:08:45,587 --> 01:08:47,022
THIS ANIMAL'S DRIVING A CAR DOWN

1692
01:08:47,022 --> 01:08:48,390
AND HE DECIDES HE'S GOING TO

1693
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:50,259
MAKE A RIGHT RIGHT INTO THE PARK

1694
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:52,394
WHERE EVERYONE'S WORKING OUT,

1695
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,330
EXERCISING, RUNNING, BICYCLING,

1696
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:57,366
AND HE KNOCKS EVERYTHING DOWN.

1697
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:58,633
INCLUDING KILLS EIGHT PEOPLE.

1698
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:01,470
AND BADLY WOUNDS -- YOU EVER

1699
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,805
NOTICE THEY NEVER TALK ABOUT THE

1700
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,005
PEOPLE WHO ARE WOUNDED WHERE

1701
01:09:04,005 --> 01:09:05,607
THEY LOSE THEIR ARMS AND THEIR

1702
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:07,176
LEGS AND THEIR LIVES CAN NEVER

1703
01:09:07,176 --> 01:09:08,410
BE THE SAME.

1704
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,745
THEY NEVER TALK.

1705
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:11,113
THEY SAY EIGHT PEOPLE DIED.

1706
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:15,084
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THE 12

1707
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:17,286
PEOPLE THAT LOST SOMETHING SO

1708
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:17,685
IMPORTANT.

1709
01:09:17,685 --> 01:09:21,390
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN A

1710
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:23,259
PARK WHERE THEY GO TO EXERCISE

1711
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,660
SO THEY CAN BE IN PERFECT SHAPE.

1712
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,496
AND THEY GO HOME MONTHS LATER

1713
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:31,066
WITHOUT THEIR LEGS, WITHOUT

1714
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:31,366
THEIR ARMS.

1715
01:09:31,366 --> 01:09:33,068
BECAUSE THIS ANIMAL GOING AT A

1716
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,603
VERY FAST SPEED JUST DECIDED

1717
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:36,337
HE'S GOING TO MAKE A RIGHT INTO

1718
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:38,439
THE PARK AND RUN PEOPLE OVER.

1719
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:41,176
SO HE HAS 22 PEOPLE THAT CAME IN

1720
01:09:41,176 --> 01:09:42,877
BECAUSE HE'S HERE.

1721
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:44,412
SO HE'S HERE.

1722
01:09:44,412 --> 01:09:46,715
IT'S CALLED CHAIN.

1723
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:47,183
A CHAIN.

1724
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:51,319
NICE NAME, CHAIN MIGRATION.

1725
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:51,653
HE'S HERE.

1726
01:09:51,653 --> 01:09:52,921
HIS MOTHER COMES WITH HIM.

1727
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:55,090
HIS FATHER THEN COMES.

1728
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,091
HIS UNCLE.

1729
01:09:56,091 --> 01:09:57,192
HIS AUNT.

1730
01:09:57,192 --> 01:09:58,827
HIS BROTHER.

1731
01:09:58,827 --> 01:09:59,127
HIS NEPHEWS.

1732
01:09:59,127 --> 01:10:00,929
HIS SISTER.

1733
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:02,731
22 PEOPLE.

1734
01:10:02,731 --> 01:10:03,165
NO JOBS.

1735
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:06,201
JUST 22 PEOPLE.

1736
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:07,669
NO MORE CHAIN MIGRATION.

1737
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:14,076
NO MORE CHAIN MIGRATION.

1738
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,845
THAT'S WHY THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO

1739
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:18,580
GIVE ILLEGAL ALIENS FREE WELFARE

1740
01:10:18,580 --> 01:10:20,949
AND THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

1741
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:23,719
THAT'S WHY DEMOCRATS WANT TO

1742
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:24,686
ABOLISH I.C.E.

1743
01:10:24,686 --> 01:10:27,823
THE CASUALTIES OF THE DEMOCRAT'S

1744
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,525
OPEN BORDER CREW SAID, AND

1745
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:33,095
YOU'RE GOING TO -- CRUSADE, AND

1746
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,530
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IT OVER THE

1747
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:35,931
NEXT TWO WEEKS.

1748
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:36,966
I WANT TO CHANGE IT.

1749
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:39,067
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH VOTES.

1750
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:40,769
AS AN EXAMPLE, WITH THE SENATE

1751
01:10:40,769 --> 01:10:42,571
WE NEED 60 VOTES.

1752
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,505
WELL, WE HAVE 51.

1753
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:45,374
WE HAVE A TINY MAJORITY.

1754
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:47,309
WE NEED 60 VOTES.

1755
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:51,346
SO THEY DON'T ALLOW US TO DO IT.

1756
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:56,352
THEY'RE KILLING AND HURTING

1757
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:57,886
INNOCENT AMERICANS.

1758
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,255
DEMOCRAT IMMIGRATION POLICIES

1759
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:02,524
ALLOW POISONOUS DRUGS AND MS-13

1760
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:06,395
TO POUR INTO OUR COUNTRY.

1761
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:08,530
AND DEMOCRAT SANCTUARY CITIES

1762
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:10,065
RELEASE VIOLENT CRIMINALS FROM

1763
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:14,169
JAIL AND STRAIGHT INTO YOUR

1764
01:11:14,169 --> 01:11:14,803
NEIGHBORHOODS.

1765
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:16,371
REPUBLICANS BELIEVE OUR COUNTRY

1766
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:19,308
SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR

1767
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:25,280
LAW-ABIDING AMERICANS, NOT FOR

1768
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,248
CRIMINAL ALIENS.

1769
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:29,684
COMMON SENSE.

1770
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:30,719
COMMON SENSE.

1771
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,953
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL ALWAYS

1772
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:34,089
STAND PROUDLY WITH THE HEROES OF

1773
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:34,390
I.C.E.

1774
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,824
THESE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE.

1775
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,693
BY THE WAY, THEY'RE GREAT

1776
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:37,959
AMERICANS.

1777
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:39,428
BUT YOU DON'T WANT THEIR JOB.

1778
01:11:39,428 --> 01:11:42,097
THEY GO INTO, THEY CALL THEM

1779
01:11:42,097 --> 01:11:43,231
NESTS, MS-13, KILLERS.

1780
01:11:43,231 --> 01:11:44,767
THEY DON'T LIKE USING GUNS

1781
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,201
BECAUSE IT'S TOO QUICK.

1782
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:47,970
THEY LIKE CUTTING PEOPLE UP.

1783
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:48,370
SLICING THEM.

1784
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:50,873
KILLING THEM LIKE THEY DID TO

1785
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:52,307
TWO BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY YOUNG

1786
01:11:52,307 --> 01:11:55,277
GIRLS GOING BACK HOME FROM

1787
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:55,577
SCHOOL.

1788
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,812
KILLING THEM, SLICING THEM.

1789
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,515
THEY DIDN'T WANT THE GUNS.

1790
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:02,517
THESE ARE EVIL PEOPLE.

1791
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:02,818
YEAH.

1792
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,252
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

1793
01:12:04,252 --> 01:12:04,452
YEAH.

1794
01:12:04,452 --> 01:12:05,420
THAT'S RIGHT.

1795
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:07,021
HE SAID IT.

1796
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:08,223
THAT'S RIGHT.

1797
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:13,261
THEY'RE ANIMALS.

1798
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:13,795
THEY'RE ANIMALS.

1799
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:16,465
SO YOU KNOW, WHEN I SEE LONG

1800
01:12:16,465 --> 01:12:21,470
ISLAND, I GREW UP NEAR LONG

1801
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:23,839
ISLAND AND I KNOW EVERY TOWN OUT

1802
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:24,106
THERE.

1803
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,741
FOR SOME REASON A LOT OF THE

1804
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,009
MS-13 WENT OUT TO LONG ISLAND

1805
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,810
AND I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM

1806
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:29,978
FRIENDS OF MINE.

1807
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:30,545
AND WE PUT I.C.E.

1808
01:12:30,545 --> 01:12:32,014
IN THERE AND

1809
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,949
IT'S LIKE YOU LIBERATE -- IT'S

1810
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,217
LIKE A WAR.

1811
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:36,051
YOU LIBERATE THE TOWN.

1812
01:12:36,051 --> 01:12:37,653
AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE CLAPPING

1813
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:38,587
AND SCREAMING.

1814
01:12:38,587 --> 01:12:40,522
AND THESE GUYS ON I.C.E.

1815
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:40,822
THEY

1816
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:42,357
WALK RIGHT INTO THOSE NESTS AND

1817
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:46,495
THEY'RE TOUGHER AND SMARTER THAN

1818
01:12:46,495 --> 01:12:46,762
MS-13.

1819
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,729
AND MS-13 RESPECTS THEM.

1820
01:12:47,729 --> 01:12:49,031
BECAUSE NONE OF YOU GUYS WANT

1821
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:49,865
THAT JOB.

1822
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:53,135
I DON'T WANT THAT JOB.

1823
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,536
MAYBE LOUIE GOMERT WILL TAKE IT.

1824
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,370
I DON'T KNOW.

1825
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:57,105
BUT I DON'T WANT THAT JOB.

1826
01:12:57,105 --> 01:12:58,673
I DON'T WANT THAT JOB.

1827
01:12:58,673 --> 01:12:59,975
BUT SERIOUSLY, THESE ARE HEROES.

1828
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:01,677
AND THEY GO IN AND THEY TAKE

1829
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,146
THEM AND THEY THROW THEM INTO

1830
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:06,381
THE PADDY WAGON THEN GET THEM

1831
01:13:06,381 --> 01:13:08,683
THE HECK OUT OF OUR COUNTRY.

1832
01:13:08,683 --> 01:13:09,751
WE REMOVE THOUSANDS OF THEM.

1833
01:13:09,751 --> 01:13:12,354
THEY CAME IN THROUGH THE

1834
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:23,198
WONDERFUL OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

1835
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:33,442
WE

1836
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:34,476
AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT. 

1837
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:39,014
AND YES, WE ARE GETTING THE 

1838
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:40,549
WORLD FINISHED BECAUSE IT IS AN 

1839
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:41,717
IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF WHAT WE 

1840
01:13:41,717 --> 01:13:43,085
NEED. 

1841
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,286
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] EVEN 

1842
01:13:44,286 --> 01:13:45,421
THE DEMOCRATS ARE SEEING IT. 

1843
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:48,257
I GOT A CALL TODAY,  THE GUY 

1844
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:49,458
SAID, YOU KNOW, WE REALLY DO 

1845
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:50,191
NEED IT. 

1846
01:13:50,191 --> 01:14:00,035
WHEN HE SEES THOSE PEOPLE 

1847
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:00,301
POURING. 

1848
01:14:00,301 --> 01:14:01,336
WE HAVE TO HAVE A WALL. 

1849
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,538
IF YOU WANT TO SECURE OUR 

1850
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:03,338
BORDERS, SUPPORT OUR LAW 

1851
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:04,172
ENFORCEMENT, STOP CATCH AND 

1852
01:14:04,172 --> 01:14:05,874
RELEASE, AND ALL OF THE OTHER 

1853
01:14:05,874 --> 01:14:06,474
THINGS I SPOKE ABOUT, VOTE 

1854
01:14:06,474 --> 01:14:06,774
REPUBLICAN. 

1855
01:14:06,774 --> 01:14:08,277
DO IT NOW ON -- OR ON NOVEMBER 

1856
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,678
6. IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO 

1857
01:14:09,678 --> 01:14:10,846
