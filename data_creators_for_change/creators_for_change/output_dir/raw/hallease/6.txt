1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,510
- Disclaimer if I'm burpy,
- All right.

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,940
it's because I'm drinking
soda, because I am sleepy.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,350
- Okay.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:06,283
All right guys,

5
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,220
oh we have an official
(slurping)

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,270
intro now.

7
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,820
Yeah, you're doing the most
with this ASMR. (laughing)

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,250
Okay, we have our official intro now,

9
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,330
so we gotta do it, so all right.

10
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,980
Hey everyone, I'm Hallease Beast,

11
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,210
I am a digital story
teller and video producer.

12
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,460
- Hi, and I'm Mr. Hallease Beast.

13
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,293
- Sure.

14
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:30,300
- Hi, and I'm Mr. Hallease.

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,310
I enjoy going to the beach,

16
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,350
and I am also an avid

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,933
college football fan.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,550
- You're a nurse.

19
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,383
- I'm a nurse.

20
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,930
- All right, this is
the Beastcast Podcast,

21
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,030
your favorite aunt and uncle discussing

22
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,477
married life and things like such as.

23
00:00:48,477 --> 00:00:51,977
(upbeat electronic music)

24
00:00:57,304 --> 00:01:01,086
(whimsical piano music)

25
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:02,240
- On this week's episode.

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,910
- We are discussing this idea of

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,963
the pecking order.

28
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,466
In a previous Beastcast,

29
00:01:11,466 --> 00:01:13,630
I had mentioned this
idea of a pecking order

30
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,170
in your relationship and
where your spouse should be

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,520
the number one, and then
everyone else should kind of

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,313
be after your spouse.

33
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,180
A few of y'all in the
comments asked for me to

34
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,370
dive, go deeper into that in a Beastcast,

35
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,010
so here we are, we're gonna talk about it.

36
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:32,860
The same idea if you're
coming at this Beastcast

37
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,500
from I guess the Christian perspective.

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,780
It's that idea of leaving and cleaving,

39
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,620
our friends Belief Mel and Mrs. Melanin,

40
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,640
they discuss this in a podcast episode,

41
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,930
How Married Are You?, their podcast.

42
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,680
I will link to it either
in the description box,

43
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,210
or in Anchor notes,

44
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,230
wherever you're listening/watching this,

45
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,510
it'll be there, and you can check it out,

46
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,444
'cause they have a very
interesting discussion on it.

47
00:01:58,444 --> 00:01:59,670
- I'm gonna go ahead and take this time

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:01,790
to do a little intermissions.

49
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,710
Hallease mentioned

50
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,450
notes or comments that somebody made,

51
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,580
and how now it's a subject of the podcast.

52
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,590
If you too would like to
leave us a message or a topic

53
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,870
that you'd like for us to discuss,

54
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,440
go ahead and leave a voicemail on Anchor.

55
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,650
Anchor is the platform that
this podcast is living on,

56
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,110
go ahead and leave a
comment on the videos.

57
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,530
Hallease is reactive on the platform,

58
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:25,730
and so she either responds,

59
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,070
or she'll make a note of some
of the subjects that you make.

60
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,220
- I live for the comments y'all,

61
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,723
I read all the comments.

62
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,413
I really do.

63
00:02:33,413 --> 00:02:34,610
- Comment, voicemail.

64
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:36,040
- It'll be in the notes.

65
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,440
- Anyway, back to the show.

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,310
- Yeah, so today we are talking
about the pecking order.

67
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,210
When I think I originally mentioned this

68
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,440
in the previous episode,

69
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,420
I was talking about it in regards to just,

70
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,970
just making sure your spouse know that

71
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,120
you see them as number one.

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,010
Then also in regards to how you interact,

73
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,490
mostly I believe, with family and friends,

74
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,563
but mostly family.

75
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,310
So that they begin to see you
and your spouse as a unit,

76
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,050
and don't try to wedge
themselves in between y'all.

77
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,287
That's making it seem like
everyone's out to get you,

78
00:03:12,287 --> 00:03:13,120
and they're not.

79
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,410
- Right, they don't do
it in a malicious way.

80
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,980
- No, it's usually more just

81
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,970
at the end of the day, your
parents aren't in your marriage.

82
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:23,830
They're your parents,

83
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,250
so they're going to have a bias, right?

84
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,580
That bias is generally
gonna tend towards you

85
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,540
as their child, favorably.

86
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,233
Whether you are right or
wrong in the situation.

87
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,520
So you have to keep that in mind.

88
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,040
I know for me, this was actually something

89
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,960
that my father told me very early on

90
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,793
when we first got married.

91
00:03:44,793 --> 00:03:46,040
'Cause when we first got married,

92
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,690
and we were moving into our
first apartment together,

93
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,130
my mother

94
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,550
wanted to help us

95
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,773
move into that apartment together.

96
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:56,730
Yeah.
- Right.

97
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,907
My dad came to me and pulled
me aside, and was like hey,

98
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:00,860
"Just so you know,

99
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,670
I'm gonna reign your mom in on this,

100
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,570
and she's not gonna help you

101
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,020
and your newly-married husband

102
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,230
move into your apartment together,

103
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,010
'cause I'm gonna put
my foot down on that."

104
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,410
- Also, partially because he didn't

105
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,260
want to help us move.

106
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,230
- Yeah, in general he just
doesn't like moving, in general.

107
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,503
But also, there was a lesson.
- Why would you?

108
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,253
There's a lesson to be taught here.

109
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,130
But he followed up to and was like,

110
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,489
"Your marriage is yours,

111
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,710
and so as your father and also
a person who's been married

112
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,380
for a couple decades now,

113
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,863
I'm gonna let you know.

114
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,400
Don't let anyone get in your marriage,

115
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,720
that is something you
need to keep in mind now,

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,830
that you are a married woman.

117
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,090
So enjoy moving into your new apartment."

118
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,193
I was like, oh wow.

119
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,700
Noted, and sure enough
that has come up even now,

120
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,590
especially with everything,

121
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,270
there have been times
where I've had to actually

122
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,430
pull my dad

123
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,623
aside and be like,

124
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,730
why are you in my marriage, sir?

125
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,200
With all due respect, you know?

126
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,640
- Right, so she has a
little bit more direct

127
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,540
communication
- I do.

128
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,210
with her parents,

129
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,230
on this topic as opposed to mine.

130
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,420
That's more of a gray area,

131
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,850
and I'd prefer not to discuss it,

132
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,250
even though I brought it up.

133
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,420
Well, I guess we are gonna discuss it huh?

134
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,320
- Then what's the episode about homey?

135
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,100
- I don't know.

136
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,050
I guess, I have a little
bit more difficulty

137
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,850
talking to my parents about it.

138
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,080
It's gotten a little bit better,

139
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,030
putting my foot down a little bit more.

140
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,773
I don't know,

141
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:28,841
just trying to blur the line

142
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:31,080
between being a good or bad son,

143
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,300
and also just cutting the umbilical cord,

144
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,700
because I don't answer to them anymore.

145
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,533
I answer to you.

146
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,120
- I think what I don't want people

147
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,860
to take away from this topic,

148
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,120
is that oh you gotta just,

149
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,570
just be cutthroat with everyone
that isn't your spouse now,

150
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,490
and that's not what I'm saying.

151
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,930
What I'm saying is like,

152
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,590
I think it's more about boundaries,

153
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,303
like appropriate boundaries.

154
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,007
Especially, and then also not using,

155
00:06:00,007 --> 00:06:01,550
and this is like a topic that maybe

156
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,710
you don't wanna talk about,

157
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,870
but not using your spouse as the scapegoat

158
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,715
for things that you don't
actually wanna do yourself.

159
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,965
(laughing)

160
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,373
Something that. (laughing)

161
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:22,200
A reason that Mr. Hallease
will give about things,

162
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,190
which sometimes it is
actually genuinely true,

163
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,340
and then sometimes it is kinda like,

164
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,410
you just didn't wanna do that,

165
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,420
and you're using me as the excuse.

166
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,117
But he'll say to people,

167
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:32,310
"Oh, well let me talk
to my wife about that.

168
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,680
Or let me talk to Hallease about that,"

169
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,250
if it's people we know.

170
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,180
When the reality is, is he
just doesn't want to do it,

171
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,143
and so he's holding off.

172
00:06:40,143 --> 00:06:41,525
- Oh man, you're giving away my secret,

173
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:44,130
you're giving away
trade secrets right now.

174
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,283
- He's holding off, which is fine.

175
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,573
When it's an interaction
where you just don't,

176
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,850
like a used car salesman
or something like that,

177
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,380
well I'm gonna talk to my wife about it.

178
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,053
Yeah, play that card,
you know what I'm saying?

179
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:58,150
- I mean, for the most part it's true.

180
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,640
If I'm making a large purchase.

181
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,090
- Well yeah, of course, yeah.

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,053
- It's not just my
finances, it's our finances.

183
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,000
- Check out our last episode.
- Whoa.

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,850
- Great segue.

185
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,683
- Yeah.

186
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,050
But then sometimes it is,
like in regards to say,

187
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,700
maybe it's a family event
or something like that,

188
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,533
where you're like,

189
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:20,260
"Oh, let me talk to Hallease about it."

190
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,190
When the reality is that
you just didn't want to go,

191
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,260
and you're holding off telling
them that you don't wanna go.

192
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,660
But then the problem with that becomes.

193
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,990
- Oh, I see where you're
coming from with this.

194
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,850
- The problem with that becomes,

195
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,210
you keep doing that with family members,

196
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:35,170
then they start to resent me,

197
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,130
because they think I'm the catalyst

198
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,800
for why you're not doing
things with your family,

199
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,130
or why you're not answering,

200
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,900
or being the good son or whatever it is

201
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,010
they were used to you doing.

202
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,410
Not realizing that before,

203
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,610
you used to just grit your teeth,

204
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,090
roll your eyes, and bear it.

205
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,680
Whereas now, you're
actually just getting older,

206
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,690
and you just don't wanna
deal with it anymore,

207
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,750
but you don't wanna be upfront with that.

208
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,920
You don't wanna deal with
it, so you're using me.

209
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,130
- If you wanna get superficial
and biblical about it,

210
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,650
then honor thy father and mother.

211
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,433
You can still honor them,
you can still respect them,

212
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,424
and not wanna hang out
with them all the time.

213
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,490
(giggling)

214
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,783
Spend 18 years with them,

215
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,280
you should be out on your own,

216
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,070
you should be doing your own thing.

217
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,657
What's the cost-benefit
analysis, you know?

218
00:08:21,713 --> 00:08:23,460
- You said cost-benefit analysis

219
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,070
for spending time with your family.

220
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,920
- It's a five hour drive to and from,

221
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,906
not doing a whole heck of a lot.

222
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:30,739
- Woo.

223
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,250
You need to see family.

224
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,559
You need to,
- Yes.

225
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,309
'cause how much time are you gonna have

226
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:37,599
with them realistically?
- That's true.

227
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,890
How much time are you
gonna have with anybody,

228
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,980
like time is finite, you know?

229
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,963
- Yeah, yeah.

230
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,472
All good points.

231
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:48,473
- Right, but so often times
I will make an excuse.

232
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,763
But sometimes, a lot of times,

233
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,730
it's oh hey are you guys coming down?

234
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,940
You can always come
down to do this or that.

235
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,360
It's like okay, sure.

236
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,370
Sometimes I don't know if
you're busy that weekend or not,

237
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,560
so I do need to consult with you.

238
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,393
- Yeah.

239
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,583
- But other times it's like,

240
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:06,750
well I'm not sure we're gonna go

241
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,410
because Hallease is out of town,

242
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,190
and then my parents got a
little bit wise to that,

243
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:14,570
and said oh, well feel
free to come down anyway.

244
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,543
- Now, they're starting
to pick through it,

245
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,809
they're starting to figure it out.

246
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,900
- Well if you're gonna
start removing the veil,

247
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,660
and lifting the veil, and
seeing the ugliness underneath,

248
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,840
then it's like okay, you know what,

249
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,300
I did not feel like
coming down this weekend.

250
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,453
So I will see you guys eventually.

251
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,207
- We interrupt this Beastcast
for a quick announcement.

252
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:36,486
(beeping)

253
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:38,628
(chuckles) I should
maybe put a little effect

254
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,150
like that in there.

255
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,420
- I kind of like the way that I did it.

256
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,830
- Okay, we'll just use
your voice or something.

257
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,663
- Okay.

258
00:09:43,663 --> 00:09:46,330
- Thank you for
listening/watching this Beastcast.

259
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,130
If you're interested in supporting us,

260
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,010
the best and easiest thing you can do

261
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:55,010
is like this video and or comment

262
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,040
happily and or,
- Constructively.

263
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,670
constructively and or, let the ads play.

264
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,600
We know they're very annoying,

265
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,370
but they really do help in supporting

266
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,600
the channel and this Beastcast.

267
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,370
- It's how most channels
get their revenue.

268
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,203
- Yes.

269
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,551
- It may be a larger
or small portion of it.

270
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,384
- Every little bit helps.

271
00:10:15,384 --> 00:10:17,130
- Some of them are a little bit long.

272
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,640
If you don't feel like
you wanna stick around

273
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,853
for the entire ad,

274
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,657
just stick around for as long as you can.

275
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:24,500
- As long as you can bear.

276
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,717
- Yep, every little bit counts.

277
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:28,190
- All right, and then the
other thing you can do,

278
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,890
if the spirit moves you,
patreon.com/Hallease

279
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,830
is where you can help support
this Beastcast financially.

280
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,420
There is no minimum amount
that you have to give,

281
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,650
but you can set a monthly max as well,

282
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,410
so that way you can always fluctuate it,

283
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:46,980
depending on your budget.

284
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,150
We do have some new Patreon
producers that joined,

285
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,390
and we're excited about 'em.
- Woo.

286
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,840
Welcome Jamie Evans.
- Hi Jamie.

287
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,010
Welcome Lydia Bared.
- Hello Miss Bard.

288
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,313
Hello Swank Smalls, welcome.
- Hello Swank Smalls.

289
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,260
Thank you so much for joining
the Patreon producer family,

290
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,140
we're happy to have you.

291
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,490
- Now back to the program.

292
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,244
- Yes, back to the program.
- Podcast.

293
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:10,577
Beastcast.
- Bye.

294
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,070
Boop. (chuckling)

295
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,560
- I mean, you have to live your own life.

296
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,010
Again, a lot of this

297
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:17,950
it's interesting
- It's tough

298
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,570
how much of this comes out
of our current situation,

299
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,670
because we're living with your parents.

300
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,530
- We are living with them, we are.

301
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,810
So for those of y'all who
are new to us in general,

302
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:30,860
because you're new
Anchor/wherever you listen

303
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,890
to your podcast listeners.

304
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,013
- First off, thanks for stopping by.

305
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,910
- Thanks for stopping by, first of all.

306
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,520
You're gonna hear us
reference the house a lot,

307
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,990
or the housing situation a lot,

308
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,027
and what we're talking about.

309
00:11:42,027 --> 00:11:42,860
- The storage unit.

310
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,970
- The storage unit, that's another.

311
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,248
- Sixth circle of hell,
it's probably like three,

312
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,081
it's level three.

313
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,700
- Anyway, you're gonna hear
us mentioning that a lot,

314
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,533
and what it is,

315
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:54,640
is at the end of 2017, we
purchased a home together.

316
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,930
Basically, we were first-time home buyers,

317
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,763
we just didn't,

318
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,180
a lot of things failed.

319
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,850
Point of the story, a
lot of things failed,

320
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,070
and we can't live in the house

321
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,740
because the home is unlivable.

322
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,530
The plumbing doesn't work,

323
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,580
and things like such as.

324
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,840
So we have been living with my parents

325
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,000
while we're working through
- Yay.

326
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,960
figuring that situation out.

327
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,900
- Co-dependents.

328
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,860
- Woo, so yeah.
- Displacement.

329
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,250
- Displacements, that's
how that's been going.

330
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,280
So when you hear us say,

331
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,180
well because of the housing thing,

332
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,860
that's what we're talking about.

333
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,239
Back to the podcast.

334
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:27,610
(laughing)

335
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,800
I definitely understand

336
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,680
how this is hard for a lot of people

337
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,660
when they get married, this whole idea of

338
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,810
the pecking order and
leaving and cleaving.

339
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,770
We're coming at it from

340
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,430
having to just learn how to
co-exist with parents, right?

341
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,920
A lot of people usually come out of it

342
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,160
too from prioritizing their
kids more than their spouse.

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,530
I'll see that happen a lot.

344
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,620
That's like woo, that's tough.

345
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:58,470
Children do need a lot
of attention, you know?

346
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,570
But I know when I was growing up,

347
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,100
my dad was very quick to acknowledge

348
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,946
that my mom was more
important to him than me.

349
00:13:05,946 --> 00:13:08,955
(laughing)

350
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:11,260
Which I appreciated,
'cause it also let me know

351
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,273
that I couldn't.

352
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,950
Kids naturally,

353
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,730
'cause I see with Sederick
already too, my nephew.

354
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,660
Kids naturally

355
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,253
will wedge themselves
in between you as well.

356
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,440
Because my parents had a pecking order,

357
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,270
and I knew that I was not the top of it,

358
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,533
for either of them,

359
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:32,470
I couldn't try a lot of things.

360
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,920
Even in the way that they raised me,

361
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,400
I couldn't try a lot of things,

362
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,100
like nothing could really get by them.

363
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,883
Oh, I wanna go do something.

364
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,610
You know as a kid, you strategize right?

365
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,943
Which parent seems to
have had a better day?

366
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,150
Which one's in a good mood?

367
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,020
Which one maybe wouldn't mind

368
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,920
me not being here for a couple hours,

369
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,650
'cause low key, they just wanna chill,

370
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,923
and they don't wanna
see me really, you know?

371
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,330
So I would ask whichever parent I felt

372
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,480
felt that way, but it
usually never worked.

373
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,500
At the end of the day, I would ask them,

374
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,330
hey I wanna go to the movies or whatever.

375
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,580
Then, they would respond
what did your mom say,

376
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,070
or what did your dad say?

377
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,150
I'd be like (sighs).

378
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,720
Usually what would end up happening is,

379
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,360
my response would have to be

380
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,203
they told me to come ask you.

381
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,240
That was, now that I'm older,
I realize what that was.

382
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,220
That was their cue to
each other to be like,

383
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,320
I don't care, you decide.

384
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,050
They weren't ever really
individuals to me, as a child,

385
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,490
they were one unit.

386
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:32,451
This one hive-mind thing that
never let me do anything.

387
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:33,960
(laughing)

388
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,793
I'm just kidding.

389
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:35,626
- Okay, that's a lot of projection there.

390
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,459
- I'm just kidding.

391
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,040
- So really, it just comes down to,

392
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,520
again we use the hierarchy model

393
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,330
because it's very easy and it's like,

394
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,670
easy to envision.

395
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,460
So you just have to think about yourself,

396
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:49,010
so who in your life, who's number one?

397
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,320
It's gotta be you, no one's gonna look out

398
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,653
for number one except number one.

399
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,090
How are you affected by things?

400
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,440
Then just immediately below that,

401
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,501
if not right next to it or on the same,

402
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:01,629
on the same plane, right.

403
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:03,750
- You're here, the other
thing's like right there.

404
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,640
- Then it's your spouse,

405
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,473
'cause whatever affects you

406
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:08,630
is gonna affect your
spouse, and vice versa.

407
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,710
That's towards the top, if not the top.

408
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:16,220
So what comes below that,
is it gonna be children?

409
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,300
Maybe, is it gonna be family, or friends,

410
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,890
or whoever else it's gonna be.

411
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,070
That's the way it's gonna play out,

412
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,400
everyone else is gonna come below that.

413
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,730
- 'Cause you also have to remember too,

414
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,950
and I think this ties into that idea

415
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,230
of respecting your parents,

416
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,300
but you also have to remember

417
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,800
your parents aren't dealing
with you day to day,

418
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,380
hour to day, anymore, right?

419
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,140
They did their time, if you will,

420
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,840
and now your spouse is the one

421
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,313
that is showing up and
showing out for you every day.

422
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,120
The way you respect them,
the way you honor them,

423
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,050
is by making them the
priority in your life,

424
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,560
and letting your parents
fall to the appropriate level

425
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,120
of priority that they should.

426
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,690
Which is honoring the
commitment that they had to you,

427
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,952
right?
- Had.

428
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:04,693
Had to you,

429
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,330
by being involved in an appropriate level

430
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,163
and appropriate amount.

431
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:15,200
But also acknowledging
that they don't have,

432
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,363
they really don't have any
claim to you anymore, really.

433
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,110
- Right, I mean they still
care about your well being.

434
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,860
- Well yeah, they're always
going to, they're parents,

435
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,400
they're always gonna care about your,

436
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,900
well I guess we're also assuming that you

437
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,733
come from.

438
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,420
- Who's got more skin in the game now?

439
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,253
- Yeah.

440
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:34,210
- It's you and I.
- Right.

441
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,740
As opposed to onlookers,

442
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,894
which can advise, or
Monday morning quarterback.

443
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:42,175
- Right, there you go.

444
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,800
- But I'm the one, my blood is being shed,

445
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,970
so I don't know what game we're
playing where blood is shed.

446
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,530
- Right, totally.

447
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,690
'Cause I mean, the thing that
I remember growing up too,

448
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,680
my dad was always like if I
gotta come home and my wife,

449
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,080
and he would not say your mother,

450
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,150
he would always say my wife

451
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,720
is talking about stuff
that you did all day,

452
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,793
I'm gonna be upset because
you're messing with my wife.

453
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,679
She didn't become my mom anymore,

454
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,859
she was his wife in those moments,

455
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:11,986
and I was like, oh.

456
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,083
Okay, you know?

457
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:20,549
There's a difference in
language that happened,

458
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,850
where I was just like, oh.

459
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:27,310
I need to make sure that I'm
on my P's and Q's or whatever

460
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,660
with this woman. (laughing)

461
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,320
- It's very much like a
team sport or tribalism too,

462
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,223
within the family.
- Yeah, totally.

463
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:35,530
There's gonna be kids, and
then there's Mom and Dad.

464
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,503
Mom and Dad have to be a unified force.

465
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,720
Mom and Dad are like, the married couple,

466
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,030
has to be a unified force in the family.

467
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,720
They have to be a unified force

468
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,123
to any external force as well.

469
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:49,690
Be that
- Yeah.

470
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,750
other family members, used
car salesman, what have you.

471
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,760
- Yeah, totally.

472
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,980
I don't know, I think that's
just like the biggest thing,

473
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,460
is this idea of yeah,
leaving and cleaving,

474
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,160
as they say biblically, and doing that.

475
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,130
It's a lot easier said
than done, you know?

476
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,923
We still have issues with it.

477
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,730
You probably have issues with it.

478
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,760
I have issues with it sometimes,

479
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,190
but as a whole, I feel
like it was not very hard

480
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,330
for me to leave and cleave.

481
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,640
I did not have too much a struggle,

482
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,110
which is interesting,
'cause then it came from

483
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,040
a very well-rounded, loving,

484
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,160
tight knit family.

485
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,993
- I did too.

486
00:18:28,993 --> 00:18:31,623
- Yeah, but I had no
problems being like deuces,

487
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:33,830
and starting my own life,

488
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,360
and maybe that's because I'm
the youngest, I don't know.

489
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,363
You're always kind of ready to be gone.

490
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,240
But I didn't really have a
lot of problems doing it.

491
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,073
Did you?

492
00:18:44,925 --> 00:18:46,470
- I mean, in order for me to do it,

493
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,170
in order for me to
exert that independence,

494
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,400
I always used space.

495
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,980
- Yeah, you always used physical space.

496
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,100
- Physical space, because
I did that for college,

497
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,833
and I went a thousand miles away.

498
00:18:58,269 --> 00:18:59,960
I did that after college,

499
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,770
then moved to San Antonio from Laredo.

500
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,603
- Yeah.

501
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,320
- There needs to be a barrier,

502
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,923
there just needs to be
something to separate.

503
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:11,560
- What would you do if
your parents lived here

504
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,580
in San Antonio?

505
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:14,530
- I just have to left them know like hey,

506
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,860
we're not available all the time.

507
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,570
If you wanna do some stuff, that's cool.

508
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,110
That's the thing, so
your parents understand,

509
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,375
it's like I'm doing my own thing.

510
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,790
- Yeah, my parents do their own thing.

511
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,180
- Yeah, your dad works on cars,

512
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,800
tinkers as he calls it,

513
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,500
and your mom is constantly busy.

514
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,054
- She's doing her own
thing 100% of the time.

515
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:35,470
(laughing)

516
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,900
- I can't even come up
with a good metaphor

517
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
for what she is.

518
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,901
She's a woman possessed.
- She's a living.

519
00:19:40,901 --> 00:19:42,550
100%.
- Living her best life.

520
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,383
She's a shark.

521
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:44,830
- Yeah, she's a shark for sure.

522
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,230
- If she stops moving, she will die.

523
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,220
- Yeah, totally, totally.

524
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,830
- But with my parents,
it's very much like,

525
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,030
oh so what are we doing?

526
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,480
When are you coming to us?

527
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:59,030
They just wanna be active
and engaged with people,

528
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,453
and that's all well
and good, it's healthy.

529
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,430
- I guess the question is like,

530
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,300
so that way we feel like we're
helping people navigate this.

531
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,170
What tips, what actionable things

532
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,270
can we offer people about this,

533
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:18,570
so that they, you know, you what I mean?

534
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,350
Exercises.

535
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,740
- You just need to have
a crucial conversation,

536
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:27,230
it's painful with whoever
it is that feels like

537
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,010
they are owed some sort of your time,

538
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,106
or some portion of your time.

539
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,270
Just need to make it explicitly clear,

540
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,790
unless you have some sort
of housing situation.

541
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,820
It's like it's always gonna be

542
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,950
number one, number two,
number one, number two,

543
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:43,840
doesn't matter, it's always gonna be us.

544
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,490
Then it's gonna be everyone else.

545
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,750
If there's time,

546
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,490
if we don't need to
decompress or something,

547
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,143
then we can make time for people.

548
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,100
- I think it's also about
having the conversation

549
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,220
with your spouse too about who you as,

550
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,710
maybe you as the spouse,
who you feel like maybe

551
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,693
your spouse is putting ahead of you.

552
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,780
You're kinda like, in the most loving way,

553
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:11,160
I kinda feel sometimes that you
put this person ahead of me.

554
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,993
- We've had that conversation before.

555
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:13,380
- It makes me feel certain top.

556
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,437
- Yep, we had that conversation before.

557
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:18,262
- Maybe you gonna just let,

558
00:21:18,262 --> 00:21:20,160
you know what I'm saying,
can we talk about that

559
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,913
for a minute or whatever?

560
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,390
- You may get a little butt hurt about it.

561
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,530
- Yeah.

562
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,363
- Which is

563
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,442
the route that I took.

564
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:30,568
(laughing)

565
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:32,200
- Yeah.

566
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,460
- But yeah, you just gotta have

567
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,150
to confront your own feelings about it.

568
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,140
It's like well, so then
again, was I doing that?

569
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,143
I was, okay, why was I doing that?

570
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,850
Because I didn't wanna have
that conversation with them.

571
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,683
Okay, well

572
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,480
who do you answer to?

573
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,880
Do you answer to them?

574
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,000
Do you answer to yourself?

575
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,380
Or to the unit.
- Right.

576
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,870
To the marriage.
- Right.

577
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,493
- It's also, I understand too,

578
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,430
the level of distance
between these people can be

579
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,500
almost incremental in how
much you ignore it, you know?

580
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,150
'Cause then it's also like,
well if they live far away,

581
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,880
say it's your parents for
example and they live far away,

582
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,524
and I only really have to deal with them

583
00:22:14,524 --> 00:22:17,503
once every couple of
months, I'll just do it.

584
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:20,960
Then it's like sure, that happens,

585
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,490
but a lot of times I think,

586
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,640
especially what your spouse
notices, is on the back end,

587
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,540
after you deal with them,

588
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,970
how much you change, what
energy you bring back

589
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,690
into the relationship from it.

590
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,570
I know for me, that was
where I was coming from,

591
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,810
where it's just like,
yo we go down to Laredo,

592
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,280
and then we come back and you are not okay

593
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,230
for a week,

594
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:43,680
and I gotta deal with that. (laughing)

595
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,250
So let's handle it now.

596
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,050
- I just have a lot of things

597
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,360
that I just need to work through,

598
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,383
and I just keep siloing them away.

599
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,740
Oh Lord, 'cause one of that
is the finance thing right?

600
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,573
- Yes.

601
00:22:54,573 --> 00:22:56,740
- Which is the previous
podcast where I felt like,

602
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,960
I just feel like I need to bring

603
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,060
something to the relationship.

604
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,320
If I don't feel like I'm contributing,

605
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,400
then I feel,
- Yeah.

606
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,410
a certain type of way,

607
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,410
and it's the same thing with my parents.

608
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,503
Or just like parents in general,

609
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,770
I don't want to assume
the role of teenager,

610
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,590
like the role of child.

611
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:15,340
Unfortunately every time I go home,

612
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,710
that is essentially what I feel like.

613
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,370
You have to allow your child

614
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,000
to make mistakes, you
also have to acknowledge

615
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,940
that your child,
- Isn't your child.

616
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,540
is your offspring but
they are not a child.

617
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,160
They have not been a child

618
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,250
for I don't know how many years.

619
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,510
Unfortunately, I cannot compartmentalize

620
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,260
those feelings when I go home.

621
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,380
The only way that I feel like
I can truly be independent,

622
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,970
is by putting this physical space.

623
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,960
- Right, so you just leave.

624
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,280
Whereas for me, and I think a lot of it is

625
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,930
because my parents,

626
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,283
yeah again, having that
certain level of just,

627
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,150
just so you know, we are
ready for you to be gone

628
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,260
when you're ready to be gone.

629
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,900
Not in a bad way, just setting,

630
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,730
they definitely always set the standard of

631
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:07,220
the goal for us is for
you to be self sufficient

632
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,410
and leave us.

633
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,930
Then we know we have done our
job well when you leave us,

634
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,883
and we will miss you, but bye.

635
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:17,200
Now that we're back
because of our situation,

636
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,940
they still very much have
that kind of mentality

637
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,440
of just like, you're grown,

638
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,490
I haven't had to think
about you financially

639
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,323
in a long time, and I don't
wanna go back to that.

640
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,180
Chill here, 'cause
we're happy to have you,

641
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,383
we enjoy your company,

642
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,763
when you're ready to go again, bye.

643
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,710
(laughing)

644
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,150
- So let's summarize this by saying that

645
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,900
we clearly do not have the answers, again.

646
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,733
- We don't.

647
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:42,828
- Because I have not deal
with these inner demons,

648
00:24:42,828 --> 00:24:44,820
and I still struggle with them.

649
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,220
I am in no position to advise you,

650
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,433
the listener/viewer.

651
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,550
- Well, even if it's not
even that you can't advise,

652
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,680
but you can say you're not alone

653
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,110
in the struggle that you're having.

654
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,720
- Yeah.

655
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,893
- That's very true.

656
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,160
You're not alone.

657
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,760
- Traditionally, parents
are difficult to deal with,

658
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,010
whether they are a force of good,

659
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,760
or they are a determent.
- Yeah.

660
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,310
But they are their own people.
- Always.

661
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,177
Hopefully, they love and appreciate you

662
00:25:17,177 --> 00:25:18,693
and you do the same.
- Yes.

663
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,250
But people make mistakes,
people aren't perfect.

664
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,580
- It's okay to love someone from afar.

665
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,800
All that to say,

666
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:31,640
hopefully we've at least given
you some tantalizing thought

667
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,710
for how you approach leaving and cleaving

668
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:36,510
in your own relationship,

669
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:40,483
and or creating a pecking order
in your own relationships.

670
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,493
Hopefully we've given you
something to think about.

671
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,153
- I hope so.

672
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:48,980
- Right, 'cause I mean
that's all we can really do,

673
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,163
to be quite honest.

674
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,723
'Cause we don't know anything,
we're not psychologists.

675
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,700
We're just a married couple

676
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,957
that is dealing with it.

677
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,140
- Let me just say that
these podcasts are hard.

678
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,480
- They're very hard.

679
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,920
People were hitting us
with serious topics.

680
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,360
- I'm just thinking about

681
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,210
trying to stay on message,

682
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:09,520
and try to make salient points.

683
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,200
- You see how always talk about

684
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,490
when you're listening to podcasts,

685
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,250
and you're like man, people
ramble and go off stuff.

686
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,680
It's like yeah,

687
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,733
that's how conversations are, you ramble.

688
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:23,340
So hopefully somewhere in this discussion,

689
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,070
you found something that was useful,

690
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:28,440
even if it was just realizing that hey,

691
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,970
your favorite aunt and uncle
are going through it too.

692
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,470
Figuring it out.
- Wow, they're a big mess.

693
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,750
Just like me.

694
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,370
Or not like me, wow I'm
doing a lot better than them.

695
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,220
Maybe that's okay.

696
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,480
- Maybe that makes us
more relatable to you.

697
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,120
Maybe it turns you off, Lord knows.

698
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,953
- Who knows.

699
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:45,793
But at the end of the day,
we'll see you next week.

700
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,573
- Yes.

701
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:49,370
- Thanks for listening/watching
