00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,339

00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:06,859
[Gun firing]

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:08,400
So, one of the first
things I noticed

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,060
about the sound of the
gunfire was that the burst

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,480
was uninterrupted.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,560
It was this kind of stream, like
a steady rhythm, which kind of

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,610
immediately jumped out to me as
being a little extraordinary.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,720
Just in past mass shootings --

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,049
semi-automatic weapons
have been used primarily.

10
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:31,340
My name is Thomas Gibbons-Neff.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,970
I'm a reporter for
the New York Times,

12
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,350
and I served in the Marine
Corps for four years

13
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,416
as an infantryman.

14
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,580
It was definitely
shooting fully automatic.

15
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,550
But at the same time,
it seemed to hiccup

16
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:45,330
in places, which could suggest
that the weapon was originally

17
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,860
built to fire semi-automatic.

18
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,690
And we don't know if
it's been modified.

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,200
Basically, it's an
uninterrupted chain of fire.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,025
So say with a
semi-automatic weapon, where

21
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:57,480
you'd have to pull the trigger
once to fire one round,

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,590
this is fully automatic.

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,960
So the shooter can
depress the trigger

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,970
and hold and fire
as many bullets

25
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,760
as he can until he
runs out of ammo.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,015
In certain videos, you
can hear lower thuds.

27
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:11,804
[Gun firing]

28
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:13,214
"What is that noise?"

29
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:14,255
"You guys, I don't know."

30
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:16,060
Or in some places,
it's a higher snap.

31
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,195
[Gun firing]

32
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:20,190


33
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,250
The higher snap is
actually the round --

34
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,380
the bullets passing
through the air --

35
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,790
while the lower thud is the
actual report of the rifle.

36
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,760
For those in that crowd, with
the shooter 500 yards away,

37
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,041
they would hear the rounds
snapping by their heads

38
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,040
or snapping through the
air, hitting the ground.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,160
[Gun firing]

40
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,570
Before they heard the
report of the rifles.

41
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,950
Depending on how many tall
buildings were around,

42
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:47,000
it would make
finding and locating

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,570
the shooter more difficult,
because the sound refracts.

44
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,950
But in this case, the shooter
firing so many rounds,

45
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,220
it'd be relatively
easy to at least know

46
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,760
the general direction of where
the fire was coming from.

47
00:01:58,760 --> 00:00:00,000
