hey guys pretty disappointing Harvard Ivy League school pretty disappointing and I'm glad I'll tell you what I'm glad that the Harvard men's soccer has had their Tire entire season revoked because they were rating women poorly that is a travesty and this is something that doesn't just go on with Harvard men's soccer it goes on with the rating system entirely across the board people just don't seem to get it right they don't know how to do it can you pull up this article so what happened was the Harvard men's soccer team was rating the female soccer team and they had numbers for them out of ten one at a ten and it was discovered these were women by the way who trusted these guys and knew them as friends and then they found out that they were a six or a seven or an eight and we've tracked down some of these women and it started with actually a quote in the article it says some of the one described in the 2012 report broke their silence in a Crimson op-ed Kelsi Clayman brooke dickens baba wawa and said they were beyond hurt to learn okay if you are going to rate someone you need to do it correctly I know it's an art not a science but there is mathematics involved in it there are two things to rating someone out of ten it's the context and how they look now I just this this mug in a book of eight by tens is a six point four six point five but when you add in my money my pedigree blah blah blah all that stuff if I was single I could probably get a seven point nine that makes me overall a seven point nine if Danny DeVito can get an eight then he is considered an eight but obviously if you were just looking at eight by tens in a binder just looks wise and especially because he's a midget or whatever he is he'd be a three point nine so with these girls we don't know their context I mean they're little kids as far as I'm concerned I'm old so I can just go purely aesthetic and that's what we'll be doing here when we go through all these girls let's start with Kelsey claiming all right her nose is big and that's that can be a problem very gummy teeth but she's obviously put together and I'm letting a little bit of Harvard sneak in here so I am using a bit of context like I know this girl isn't in a trailer park doing math so I have to admit even though I don't know her I am letting that seep seep in to the rating but the beauty of the art of rating I heard this girl got a a 5.8 from the Harvard men's soccer and that pisses me off because a lot of guys will go oh blonde with big tits 9/10 ugly chick she's a 1-liter Dunham's a 1 you have to leave room at the bottom for burn victims and women and men who weigh like 1500 pounds and then as far as 10s go well there's a bell curve and I believe that you should only say you saw 10 maybe once a month maybe once every two months don't go throwing around 9s and 10s every time you ask your girl what she is she goes I'm a 10 you go well especially black people from some reason every time I ask a black guy what is he goes yo I'm a 10 I'm like Sherrod you're a fuckin solid seven at best but uh yeah a 10 should be very rare you can remember Angelina Jolie bad Brad Pitt all those you know supermodel movie star stuff they have to occupy the top spots you can't be taking their nines intense them anyway this woman I'm going to give her seven seems nice that the the the soccer team was way off they should be punished for being cruel this is a I just can't say seven see it's a lot of it is your gun I'm gonna go with six point nine nine six point nine nine four Kelsey Clayman and screw you Harvard men's soccer for throwing out five point eight what let's go to Brooke Dickens the other girl very upbeat I mean part of it too with attraction is you're looking for a wife and you can just tell she's always positive it was fun to be around and Superbowl she makes a little sausage little pigs in a blanket things and stuff he's fun so she'd be a great made great breeder I can't really see her body but I'm Canadian and and we were coats so much that we really judge most women just by this one little goalie mask part of their body like we don't even see their ass most of the year anyway the men's soccer reportedly gave her a seven that's too mean once again they screwed up this is a seven point six seven point six for Brooke Dickens aleca keen weird names here Oh an african-american lady not your most standard beauty but clearly healthy and of good stock going to Harvard seven seems like the bigotry of low expectations six feels realistic rule and I believe some of these guys gave her a 5 which is racist this woman is clearly a solid six and I mean that with the the most enthusiasm possible she should be on the cover of six magazine and other sixes should read about her and go sixes who made it you know you can be the hottest six in town all right Emily Moss back her breathtaking is not really my type but I can look through that see there's a sight hotter not calm it says it's now a dating site but back in the early 2000s there'd be a face like mine and it would say six point five and you go that's mean me and you know they go will you looks like Donald settle in with AIDS and then you'd look down below it and would say three hundred and ninety thousand people voted for this so although it's not a science if three hundred and eighty thousand people get to the number six point five you're a six point five it's just a fact so I take that into account like I ignore my types I'm more of an Evo Eva Mendez like ethnically ambiguous types but I have a brain and eyeballs like I'm not going to kick Pamela Anderson on a bed for eating crackers so this woman is clearly point eight five that's a seven point 85 now I believe this soccer team gave her a seven which again guys did you think you were gonna be playing soccer all year making idiotic mistakes like being 0.85 off of course not grow up all right Lauren Varela was another one what see this is why I'm happy I don't go throwing eights and nines around so when one of them comes along I could see now can you zoom in on her I don't know if we have the technology here but that is something else I don't know if that's her prom or something you know you're zooming in on me dude uh can you zoom in on her or not why did you nod we're losing time here this is all very important stuff oh that is right am i let's right up my alley I like cute I like Bambi my types are ethnically ambiguous I like cute ones like Barbie Benton and I like sort of a sense of plumpness she has all that she has a cartoony Italian face obviously way too young for my taste the guy behind her by the way just for context is a 1.9 she is can we scroll down now the soccer team gave her a 9 which is just dumb no no no don't jump ahead she's obviously not a 9 but she's damn close so the men's soccer team didn't screw up that bad I'm gonna give her a what feels good you gotta feel it in your chest eight point five and lastly let's do Hayley Washburn now Hayley Washburn I can tell this is a bad picture it's blown out she looks much older than she is thanks to that flash I think young girls have a self-esteem problem they have too much self-esteem and they'll take a bad picture and go that looks great and you go home you look like you're a beautiful 40 year old so I can I can de filter that on the app and I can see through the mistakes here with the flash I know what I'm looking at I'm looking at a solid 7.6 and the men's soccer team of course screwed up the little kids they see the blown up flash they go oh it looks kind of old in this six no guys use your brains that's it for the ratings and I have had enough of these these amateurs coming in and going she's hurt she's of - oh she's got big tits she's a ten you're not invited to the rating system gentlemen it's two things basic looks and then also if you have the information context you merge those together to get a number do it right are we gonna revoke your season - hi folks that was a rebel media short I have my own show on rebel media called how's it going I you got to pay for that one check it out right here
