19
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,829
raining a lot while we're here today was

20
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first truly lovely day it was very</font>

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,070
everyone so welcoming and kind and I was

25
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">very nervous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the whole English</font>

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,510
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't like being in a place</font>

27
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,570
where I don't speak the language because

28
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,520

finished look on the plane called

31
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,629
strange weather in Tokyo it's a really

32
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,070
great story about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how a relationship</font>

33
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,080
develops between two people and how a

34
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,909
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time just kind of being in their</font>

35
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,350
presence like that's a very important

36
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,390
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you don't have that you miss</font>

37
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,729
it yeah I think above all it was like a

38
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,869
novel about being present which has been

39
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,790
a big thing for me here as well you know

40
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,159
obviously I can't show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some of the</font>

41
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,890
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here but i</font>

42
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,270
also haven't really taken money because

43
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:27,450
it's been a real gift to be present and

44
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,079
to yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be here i'm pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tired</font>

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how that happened</font>

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,009
I all of a sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> got pretty exhausted</font>

00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,150
