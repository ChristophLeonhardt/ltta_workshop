THE HULK, WHEN I DID THAT

35
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:02,976
SERIES, IT WAS LIKE A PIONEER.

36
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,977

58
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,021
I CAN'T KEEP TRACK.

59
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:49,122
MY KIDS CAN.

60
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:55,628

00:02:11,678 --> 00:02:13,713
>> Neil: 30, 40 YEARS TOO SOON.

67
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:16,516
YOU WERE AHEAD OF THIS WAVE.

68
00:02:16,516 --> 00:02:18,251
>> YEAH.

LIKE THE CELEBRITY APPRENTICE OF

81
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,239
FINANCE AND BODY BUILDING.

82
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,774
PEOPLE BRING THEIR BRAND TO THE

83
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:41,274
SHOW.

84
00:02:41,274 --> 00:02:43,610
IT'S ON DISCOVERY, LIFE CHANNEL.

85
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,712
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE THAT HAVE

86
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:46,146
DISABILITIES.

87
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:47,814
THEY WANT TO BRING IT TO THE

88
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:49,049
SHOW, MAKES THEM FEEL BETTER

89
00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:49,783
THAN THEY ARE.

90
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:50,817
LIKE ENTREPRENEURS.

91
00:02:50,817 --> 00:02:51,684
IT'S HARD FOR THEM.

92
00:02:51,684 --> 00:02:53,686
>> Neil: I THINK IT'S A GOOD

93
00:02:53,686 --> 00:02:53,987
IDEA.

94
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:55,388

CLOSE.

98
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:03,463
YOU'RE ON HIS FITNESS COUNCIL.

99
00:03:03,463 --> 00:03:03,863
>> YES.

100
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,832
I WENT THERE A WEEK AGO.

101
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,367
WE'RE COMING UP A PLAN.

102
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:09,402
WE HAD A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE.

103
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,172
I WANT TO MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY.

104
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:14,307
>> Neil: YOU GO A WAYS BACK,

105
00:03:14,307 --> 00:03:16,810
EVEN DURING THE CAMPAIGN, ONE OF

106
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,145

I FOCUS ON MAKING AMERICA

112
00:03:31,891 --> 00:03:32,258
HEALTHY.

113
00:03:32,258 --> 00:03:35,195
I'M NOT A POLITICAL GUY.

114
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:37,797
AS A PRESIDENT, RESPECT HIM.

115
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:39,165
I PEOPLE THINK IT'S EASY.

116
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,368
YOU HAVE TO SIT IN THAT CHAIR.

117
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:43,269
RESPECT OUR PRESIDENT.

118
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:46,206
YOU HAVE OBAMA, OUR PAST LEADER.

119
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:46,673
RESPECT HIM.

120
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:50,310

121
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,144
>> YEAH.

122
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:52,212
>> Neil: YOU'RE BUSY TODAY.

123
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:54,547
BUT WHEN THE PRESIDENT CAME OUT

124
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,783
ON THE NORTH LAWN TODAY AND HE

125
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:59,619
WAS TALKING TO ALL OF THESE

126
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:00,420
JOURNALISTS, TAKING QUESTIONS

127
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,655
FROM EVERYBODY, AND A LOT OF

128
00:04:02,655 --> 00:04:04,791
THEM ARE IN YOUR FACE.

129
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,326
WHAT DID YOU THINK?

130
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:07,127
>> IT'S TOUGH.

131
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:09,429
HE HANDLED IT VERY WELL.

132
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:11,664
EVERY DAY THEY BEAT HIM UP.

133
00:04:11,664 --> 00:04:12,932
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

134
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:14,134
IT'S A TOUGH SITUATION.

135
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,668
HE'S DEALING WITH ALL OF THESE

136
00:04:15,668 --> 00:04:18,471
WORLD AFFAIRS LIKE NORTH KOREA

137
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:19,238
AND IMMIGRATION.

138
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:19,839
IT'S TOUGH.

139
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,741
I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.

140
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,777
I FEEL SAFE WITH HIM AS A

141
00:04:24,777 --> 00:04:25,145
PRESIDENT.

142
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:25,912
>> Neil: SO YOU DON'T THINK

143
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:29,883
SOMETIMES HE CAN BE SENSITIVE TO

144
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:30,984
THE CRITICISM?

145
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:35,588
HE SHOULD LET IT GO AWAY.

146
00:04:35,588 --> 00:04:36,589
>> NO.

147
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,958
PUT YOURSELF IN HIS SHOES.

148
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:43,930
THE MEDIA IS TOUGH.

149
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,732
I'D RATHER BE THE DEPUTY

150
00:04:45,732 --> 00:04:46,065
SHERIFF.

151
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:47,467
>> Neil: IT'S TRUE.

152
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:48,668
I READ ABOUT THAT.

153
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:50,803
IN THAT ROLE, DID YOU EVER STOP

154
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:52,172
SOMEONE FOR SPEEDING AND DID

155
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:53,706
THEY SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT?

156
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:55,842
>> THEY SEE ME AND THEY TRY TO

157
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:56,476
RESPECT ME.

158
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,178
I WANT THROUGH THE ACADEMY 15

159
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:58,811
YEARS AGO.

160
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:01,681
MY FATHER WAS AN NYPD

161
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:02,081
LIEUTENANT.

162
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:03,249
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN FASCINATED WITH

163
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:04,150
LAW ENFORCEMENT.

164
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,752
I WENT THROUGH THE ACADEMY AND I

165
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,387
WANT TO GIVE BACK.

166
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,489
IT'S FUNNY WHEN YOU GET

167
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:10,757
OLDER,DOWN WANT TO GIVE BACK.

168
00:05:10,757 --> 00:05:13,426
>> Neil: NO, YOU'VE DONE A LOT

169
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:16,162
OF GOOD, ESPECIALLY FOR KIDS.

170
00:05:16,162 --> 00:05:17,363
HOW DO YOU KEEP IN TRACK?

171
00:05:17,363 --> 00:05:19,432
>> DO 30 MINUTES OF CARDIO AND

172
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:21,501
30 MINUTES OF WEIGHT TRAINING.

173
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:24,404
THE MOST IMPORTANT IS WHAT YOU

174
00:05:24,404 --> 00:05:25,104
EAT.

175
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:27,140
>> Neil: WHEN YOU SAY WEIGHT

176
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,508
TRAINING, DOES IT COUNT IF

177
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,843
YOU'RE CURLING SUBMARINE

178
00:05:30,843 --> 00:05:31,811
SANDWICHES OR NO?

179
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:32,712
>> NO.

180
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:34,647
HAVE TO KEEP IT SEPARATE.

181
00:05:34,647 --> 00:05:35,748
>> Neil: I UNDERSTAND.

182
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:37,250
SO HOW DO YOU POLICE WHAT YOU

183
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:37,517
EAT?

184
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:40,753
>> AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A

185
00:05:40,753 --> 00:05:45,391
BALANCED DIET, I STAY AWAY FROM

186
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,727
UNREFINED SUGARS.

187
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:52,498
YOU CAN HAVE A CHEAP MEAL BY

188
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:54,100
STAY AWAY FROM COKES.

189
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,835
>> Neil: SO YOU EXERCISE EVERY

190
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:56,102
DAY.

191
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,036
SOMEONE SAID YOU'RE NOT ABOUT

192
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:57,637
THIS.

193
00:05:57,637 --> 00:06:01,140
NO MATTER WHAT, YOU DO IT EVERY

194
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,141
SINGLE DAY.

195
00:06:02,141 --> 00:06:02,909
>> YES.

196
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:07,480
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONSCIOUS OF

197
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,815
EATING HEALTHY.

198
00:06:08,815 --> 00:06:11,217
>> Neil: I WORK OUT TO.

199
00:06:11,217 --> 00:06:15,688
>> I WAS 43 WHEN I CAME BACK TO

200
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:16,089
COMPETITION.

201
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:16,723
>> Neil: I DON'T CARE.

202
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:18,591
I'M LOOKING AT THE PERSON ON THE

203
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,025
LEFT.

204
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,628
THAT'S MY DOING MY ORIGINAL

205
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:22,128
HULK.

206
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:25,198
I'M NOT CHANGING OUT OF MY SUIT

207
00:06:25,198 --> 00:06:26,399
AND GOING ON AIR.

208
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:28,234
THE STAFF KEEP THEIR DISTANCE

209
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:28,568
THERE.

210
00:06:28,568 --> 00:06:30,570
>> WHAT ABOUT CONSISTENCY?

211
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,738
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

212
00:06:31,738 --> 00:06:33,673
SOME DAYS I DON'T WANT TO GO TO

213
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:34,173
THE GYM.

214
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:35,174
IT'S ABOUT MAKING THE EFFORT TO

215
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:35,808
DO IT.

216
00:06:35,808 --> 00:06:37,143
THAT'S WHY WITH THE COUNCIL,

217
00:06:37,143 --> 00:06:39,979
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO DO IT SO

218
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:42,515
MANY KIDS WITH OBESITY.

219
00:06:42,515 --> 00:06:45,051
HEAD PHONES, TEXTING.

220
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,820
GET THEM INVOLVED IN SPORTS.

221
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,022
WHEN TRUMP PICKED THESE PEOPLE,

222
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:49,489
IT'S HUGE.

223
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,658
WE NEED THAT FOR THIS COUNTRY.

224
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:53,426
>> Neil: I NEED YOU TO TALK TO

225
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:53,893
MY SONS.

226
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:54,494
>> I WILL.

227
00:06:54,494 --> 00:00:00,000
>> Neil: THIS COULD GET UGLY.
