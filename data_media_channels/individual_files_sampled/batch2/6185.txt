now one more from banner publican establishment is trying to nullify the 2016 election that's a brutal fact we have to face the Republican is the Republican establishment wants to nullify the 2016 trying to nullify the 2016 election absolutely who I think I think Mitch McConnell to a degree Paul Ryan they do not want Donald Trump's populist economic nationalist agenda to be implemented it's very obvious it's obvious it's obvious it's obvious as night follows day you are attacking on many fronts people who you need to help you to get things done they're not gonna help you unless they're put on notice they're going to be held accountable if they do not support the president I states right now there's no accountability they have totally they do not support the president's program it's an open secret on Capitol Hill everybody in this city knows it and so is therefore now that you're out of the White House you go into war with absolutely so I think the way that Stephen and Donald Trump handled Mitch McConnell Paul Ryan was a mistake and I think that they blundered into it and had terrible strategy surrounding it but you might be surprised to find out that overall I don't disagree with his idea I on two grounds number one there is such a thing as a Republican establishment as there is a Democratic establishment and they do not agree with their popular spaces so the Republican establishment wants tax cuts free trade trade deals and free trade is a wrong way of thinking about it anyway most people are in favor of free trade they want trade deals that are geared to help corporations that only corporations in my opinion and and Steve ban has a slightly different take on that but but he's against some of the trade deals so there are things that Trump ran on that the Republican establishment does not like that is absolutely true did they try to co-opt the Trump presidency and get him to go in their direction absolutely they did did they largely succeed yes they largely succeeded it's his administration is now filled with bankers and and standard Republican politicians and people that are part of the military-industrial complex so yes the establishment largely won I really don't think Steve ban is that wrong about any of that now whether they should win is a different question I can't stand the Republican establishment Democratic establishment is better but not much better I can't stand them either the only thing that's worse than those two parts of the establishment is the populist right that I think is barbaric and in favor of racial policies that I think are horrific and an populism that I think goes in exactly the wrong direction but is it true that Trump was in favor of that populism during the campaign and did he win partly because of that yes is he going in a different direction now yes and if you believe it Steve Bannon does should you go to war with the Republican establishment yes so the way that they should have handled it is they should have been strategic about how they did it so if you are going to threaten specific Republican senators you should threaten ones that have upcoming elections and those upcoming elections you could sway and then send a message to the rest of them and you should be cognizant of how many votes you need in the short term while you build towards votes in the long term you should have candidates that are ready to run against them in primaries these are all the things that you should do that Trump did not do because he is an imbecile so I don't know the relative intelligence of Steve Bannon but if he told him hey go get the Republicans before you pass any legislation well then he's an idiot too it depends on how you do that strategy there's a smart way to do it and there was a Trump way to do the Trump way to do it was go punch everybody on your own side in the face and hope that it comes out well no that is very poorly executed and if you thought that the establishment was headed in the wrong direction Donald Trump well you showed it in a very curious way but higher by hiring wall-to-wall establishment figures that are leading you in that direction the reality is Donald Trump does anything became B in terms of ideology between the populace and the establishment all he knows is how do I get elected well oh these crowds want to hear me talk against trade me against trade yeah who they like that and then he gets into office and he's surrounded by these establishment figures he's like how do I get them to like me oh I hire them and I do what they say he only he only has enough brain cells to figure out who's in the room and how do I get them to like me that's Donald Trump 101 he has no ability to strategize into the long term that's what explains all this even if you agree with Steve Bandhan strategy it was certainly not executed by Donald Trump and it's possible that Bannon is just as dumbest Trump is and he thought no matter what you do is he's the character all of it man you just go to war and then you just randomly hit them and then haha six years later Murkowski you'll see what happened no she won't six years later Trump won't even be in office so at this point since the ban is out of office and no longer the chief strategist Donald Trump how bright or on bright he is is a lot less relevant we do no other imbecile in charge and there's even if you think it's the right strategy there's no way he executes Sitwell all he's ever done is bungle it and that's what it'll continue to do because he's just not smart enough to do anything else help us build independent media together come join us TYT Network comm slash join
