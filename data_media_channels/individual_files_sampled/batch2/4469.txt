so we want to get to some news breaking this morning about the legal drama for the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen NBC News has confirmed Cohen's team is dropping lawsuits against BuzzFeed Cohen filed this libel suit right after BuzzFeed published the now infamous steel dossier remember when that happened that included unverified claims about Cohen's alleged meetings with Russian operatives and then there's the new report this morning that advisers to the president are getting more and more worried Cohen's gonna flip if he ends up charged in the criminal investigation related to that FBI raid that happened about a week and a half ago I want to bring in now guy Louis former US attorney for the Southern District of Florida and Andres tuccio White House reporter at Politico you just saw the headline of his new piece pop up on screen this there so God let me start with you we have a new statement from Michael Cohen's lawyer David Schwartz I just got it I into my my phone actually a couple minutes ago from from mr. Schwartz who says the decision to voluntarily discontinue these cases was a difficult one we believe the defendants defamed my client and vindicating mr. Cohen's rights was and still remains important but given the events that have unfolded and the time attention and resources needed to prosecute these matters we have dismissed the matters despite their merits guy legally what does this say to you does this say that Cohen's legal team just determined this wasn't worth it anymore I don't think it was really a difficult decision to dismiss the case in truth and in fact how do you remember the scene and The Wizard of Oz were the house Dorothy and the house are all up in the twister the tornado that's what Michael Cohen's legal life is right is like right now so anything that his lawyers can do in this case dismiss another lawsuit yet another case that he's been he's involved in where he's the plaintiff and put his house on the ground and try to settle things a little bit is a good thing for Michael Cohen Andrew you have this reporting out talking about how there is some concern among people in Donald Trump's inner circle that Michael Cohen may not be the loyal loyalist that everybody talks about him being what are you hearing yeah I mean people around the president and this has been brought directly to the president's attention as The Wall Street Journal first reported yesterday as well I mean they're concerned that if that if Michael Cohen through the course of this investigation faces serious charges including potential prison time that he's going to basically make a deal and start working with federal authorities they were pretty concerned about an interview that CNN they did with CNN right after the raid and which he was very complimentary to sort of the FBI who had just raided his home in office and people said that's not the Michael Kohn that they're used to seeing he's sort of an attack dog type person so so there's there's real concern in Trump's inner circle right now there's also this other story that's coming out related to potential problems for Donald Trump related to Karen McDougal who alleges that she had a 10-month relationship with Donald Trump a decade ago something that the White House the president's team has denied McDougal has now reached a settlement with American media which is the parent company the National Enquirer as you know the company the Pater by the way $150,000 in August of 2016 for the rights to her story about then-candidate Trump at the time and then never published it now mcdougal says this agreement frees her from this contract of ami that prevented her from sharing her story but that agreement also ends Ali a civil suit rather brought by mcdougal in that suit she claims that ami fraudulently entered in that agreement a spokesperson for ami is denying mr. Cohen or mr. Trump influenced the company's editorial decisions but guy let me get you on this because mcdougal has to a large degree already shared her story right she went out she talked about it on national television what practical effect does this latest legal move have well that's a good question it basically releases her to talk about what she claims was an affair in 2006 indeed the same year that stormy Daniels claims she had an encounter with the president as well before she couldn't really talk about it she was contractually bound and couldn't speak about it couldn't be interviewed about it now she apparently gets to keep her hundred and fifty thousand dollars and can also talk about her relationship her alleged relationship with the President of the United States which what she already talked about guys so this seems to be more about maybe the money is that a fair assessment you know she came out look how is she came kinda said it's not about the money but look I'm a sinkhole all your former prosecutor it's it's always about the money it's about the money of course it's about the money she's she got like call me like stormy like others it's about the money guy Louis thank you for your perspective for joining us Andrus Tucci a great reporting in Politico thanks for coming on set hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos
