my staff recommended recusal they said that since I had involvement with the campaign I should not be involved in any campaign investigation I have studied the rules and considered their comments and evaluation I believe those recommendations are right and just therefore I have recused myself in the matters that deal with the Trump campaign the exact language of that refusal is in the press release that we we will give you read this quote i am now decided to reduce myself from any existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to the campaign for president of the united states i went on to say this announcement should not be interpreted as confirmation of the existence of any investigation or suggestive of the scope of any such such investigation because we in the Department of Justice resists confirming or denying the very existence of investigation I was taken aback a little bit about this brand new information his allegation that of surrogates and I had been called a surrogate for Donald Trump had been meeting continuously with Russian officials or and that's what I it struck me very hard and that's what I focused my answer on and in retrospect if i should have slowed down and said but I did meet one Russian official a couple of times that would be the ambassador thank you all take care
