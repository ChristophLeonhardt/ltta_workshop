AFRICAN AMERICANS AND  
HISPANICS. 
THE DEFEAT OF ISUS AND ONGOING 
WORK TO ACHIEVE PEACE 
ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA. 
EARLIER TODAY, THE PRESIDENT 
SPOKE WITH THE NEW 
PRESIDENT OF COLUMBIA, AND 
CONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS 
RECENT ELECTORAL VICTORY. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP NOTED THE 
STRONG PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN 
OUR TWO COUNTRIES, AND 
DISCUSSED THE SECURITY 
CHALLENGES THE NEW CLIMBIAN 
GOVERNMENT WILL FACE AS 
HE ENTERS OFFICE. 
WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO SET UP A 
CALL BETWEEN THE 
PRESIDENT AND PRESIDENT OF 
TURKEY TO REAFFIRM OUR 
STRONG BOND. 
WE ENCOURAGED TURKEY TO TAKE 
STEMS TO STRENGTHEN ITS 
CATASTROPHE AND CONTINUE 
PROGRESS TOWARD RESOLVING 
ISSUES IN THE BILATERAL 
RELATIONSHIP. 
LASTLY, AND ON A SLIGHTLY 
LIGHTER AND MORE POSITIVE 
NOTE, IT SHOULD BE AN EXCITING 
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
AT THE COLLEGE WORLD SERIES, 
SINCE THE ARKANSAS 
RAZOR BACKS WILL BE PLAYING AND 
TAKE ON OREGON STATE 
STARTING TONIGHT IN OMAHA. 
SO GO HOGS, AND WITH THAT, I'LL 
TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. 
JONATHAN? 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE 
PRESIDENT'S TWEET 
OVER THE WEEKEND WHERE HE SAID 
PEOPLE CROSS THE 
BORDER ILLEGAL ARE SENT BACK 
WITH IN COURT CASES, NO 
JUDGES. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT BELIEVE THAT 
UNDOCUMENTED 
IMMIGRANTS HAVE NO DUE PROCESS 
RIGHTS WHATSOEVER? 
>> VIRTUALLY ALL AMERICANS 
AGREE THAT IT MAKES NO 
SENSE THAT AND ILLEGAL AIL I 
DON'T KNOW SETS ONE 
FOOT ON AMERICAN SOIL, AND THEY 
WOULD GO THROUGH A 
THROW- TO FIVE-YEAR JUDICIAL 
PROCESS TO BE REMOVED 
FROM THE COUNTRY. 
THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS 
REMOVED EVERY MONTH 
WITHOUT SEEING AND DOCTORS 
JUDGE AS A RESULT OF 
PROCEDURES AND CURRENT LAW, 
INCLUDING VOLUNTARY 
REMOVAL AND EXPEDITED REMOVAL. 
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE A 
JUDGE DOESN'T MEAN I 
DON'T AREN'T RECEIVING DUE 
PROCESS. 
THE PRESIDENT IS FOCUSED ON 
SECURING OUR BOARDERS 
AND REFORMING OUR IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM TO PREVENT THE 
CRISIS AT THE BORDER FROM 
BETTING WORSE. 
>> SAYING NO JUDGES, NO COURT 
CASES. 
SO NO OPPORTUNITY TO CLAIM 
ASYLUM, IN OPPORTUNITY TO 
HAVE THEIR CASES REVIEWED 
BEFORE A JUDGE. 
>> NO. 
LIKE I SAID, JUST BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T SEE A JUDGE 
DOESN'T MEAN YOU AREN'T 
RECEIVING DUE PROCESS. 
ALSO THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE US STOP PEOPLE 
FROM ILL REALLY ENTERING THE 
COUNTRY AT ALL. 
WE'D LIKE TO HAVE SECURE 
BORDERS. 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE THE ONES THAT 
WANT OF BORDERS. 
THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO 
SECURE THE BORDERS AND 
HAVE AN EASY IMMIGRATION 
PROCESS SO PEOPLE CAN COME 
THE RIGHT WAY, NOT THE WRONG 
WAY. 
>> IN ADDITION WHAT JOHN WAS 
ASKING, UNDER CURRENT 
LAW -- AND YOU SPOKE TO THIS, 
CONTIGUOUS COUNTRIES 
TO THE UNITED STATES, LIKE 
MEXICO AND CANADA, PEOPLE 
CAN BE REMOVED AT AN EXPEDITED 
PAY SIS. 
>> CORRECT. 
>> THEY CAN BASICALLY JUST BE 
TAKEN TO THE NEAREST 
BORDER CROSSING AND SENT BACK. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT WANT TO 
UMPPLEMENT THAT TYPE OF 
POLICY FOR PEOPLE FROM 
NONCONTIGUOUS COUNTRYS? 
>> THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE MORE EXPEDITED 
REMOVAL. 
BUT ULTIMATELY THE PRESIDENT 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR 
BORDER SECURED SO THAT WE DON'T 
HAVE ALL OF THESE 
PROBLEMS TO BEGIN WITH. 
. HE WANT TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT 
WORKS. 
. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE WE SHOULD 
HAVE OPEN BORDERS. 
HE WANTS TO STOP THAT. 
HE WANTS TO STOP THE CRIME THAT 
COMES INTO THIS 
COUNTRY. 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO. 
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
CONGRESS STEP UP AND WORK 
WITH US. 
>> THE PRESIDENT ALSO SAID IN 
THE OVAL OFFICE PEOPLE 
HAVE PROPOSED ADDING 5,000 
JUDGES. 
WHO HAS PROPOSED TO ADD 0,000 
JUDGES? 
>> THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF 
DIFFERENT PROPOSALS, 
QUITE A FEW THAT WE'VE SEEN. 
WE'VE LAID OUT WHAT WE WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE, AND 
HOPEFULLY CONGRESS WILL WORK 
WITH US TO MAKE THAT 
HAPPEN. 
>> I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A 
COUPLE STATEMENTS ON 
TRADE. 
WHAT IS THE PRESIDENT'S 
REACTION TO THE HARDLY 
DAVIDSON ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY? 
DOES HE STILL FEEL THAT TARIFFS 
ARE THE WAY TO GO? 
>> THE PRESIDENT'S TRADE AND 
ECONOMIC POLICIES HAVE 
BEEN A HUGE BENEFIT TO THE 
AMERICAN ECONOMY. 
THIS INCLUDES THE CREATION OF 
OVER 300,000 
MANUFACTURING JOBS. 
UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT 3.8%, THE 
LOWEST SINCE 2000. 
THE EUROPEAN UNION IS 
ATTEMPTING TO PUNISH U.S. 
WORKERS WITH UNFAIR AND 
DISCRIMINATORY TRADE 
POLICIES, AND PRESIDENT TRUMP 
WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH 
FOR FREE, FAIR, AND RECRIP ARE 
YOU CALL TRADE IN THE 
HOPES THE EU WILL JOIN US ON 
THAT 
>> ON THE STORY ABOUT CHINESE 
INVESTMENTS, 
CURTAILING POSSIBLE CHINESE 
TECH INVESTMENTS, THE 
TREASURE SECRETARY STEVE 
MNUCHIN SAID A STATEMENT 
WOULD BE FORTHCOMING, AND WE 
STILL DON'T HAVE IT. 
WHEN MIGHT THAT BE COMING, OR 
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE 
ADMINISTRATION'S STANCE ON 
THIS? 
>> AGAIN, AS THE SECRETARY 
SAID, A STATEMENT WOULD 
GO OUT THAT TARGETS ALL 
COUNTRIES THAT ARE TRYING TO 
STEAL OUR TECHNOLOGY, AND WE 
EXPECT THAT TO BE OUT 
SOON. 
ANYONE THAT GOES TO A PORT OF 
ENTRY SEEKING ASYLUM WILL NOT 
BE PROSECUTE AND WE WOULD 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THE 
CORRECT SYSTEM AND NOT TRY TO 
BREAK THE LAW. 
>> Reporter: FOLLOWING UP ON 
HARLEY DAVIDSON, THEY ANNOUNCED 
IN AN SEC FILING THEY ARE 
MOVING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF 
THEIR OPERATIONS TO EUROPE 
BECAUSE OF THE EU TARIFFS THAT 
WERE PLACED ON THE HARLEY 
DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLES. 
IS THIS WHAT THE PRESIDENT 
ENVISIONED FOR WHAT THE IMPACT 
WOULD BE BY PLACING TARIFFS ON 
THE EU AND RETALIATION? 
>> AGAIN THE EU IS TRYING TO 
PUNISH U.S. WORKERS BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE ENGAGED REPEATEDLY IN 
UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES AND THE 
PRESIDENT IS SAYING ENOUGH IS 
ENOUGH. 
WE'D LINING TO WORK WITH THE EU 
TO WORK ON A LEVEL PLAYING 
FIELD. 
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT 
TODAY IN THE OVAL OFFICE 
SITTING NEXT TO THE KING OF 
JORDAN MENTIONED SOME PROGRESS 
IN THE MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
PROCESS BUT HE DIDN'T GIVE US 
ANY SPECIFICS. 
THERE HAS BEEN QUITE A BIT OF 
DIPLOMACY GOING ON WITH JARED 
KUSHNER AND JASON. 
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING CONCRETE 
TO TELL US ABOUT ANY SORT OF 
POSITIVE MOVEMENT WHATSOEVER 
FROM ALL OF THERE? 
>> AGAIN, I THINK THAT THE 
MEETINGS THAT TOOK PLACE OVER 
THE LAST WEEK WITH SENIOR 
ADVISER JARED KUSHNER AND 
SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE JASON 
GREEN BLATT, THAT MET WITH A 
NUMBER OF PRINCIPLES IN SAUDI 
ARABIA, JORDAN, EGYPT AND QATAR 
LAST WEEK AND DISCUSSED THE 
SITUATION IN GAZA AS WELL AS 
THE NEXT STAGES OF THE PEACE 
EFFORT. 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS AND WE ARE 
COMMITTED TO THE PEACE EFFORT 
AND WE ARE GOING TO KEEP 
WORKING FORWARD. 
>> Reporter: THE COMMISSIONER 
OF CUSTOMS SAID TODAY THEY 
WOULD NO LONGER BE REFERRING 
FOR CRIMINAL CHARGES IF THEY 
ARE TRAVELING WITH CHILDREN, 
WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY RETURNED 
TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION 
PRACTICE AND ADMINISTRATIONS 
BEFORE THAT. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT SUPPORT THAT 
APPROACH. 
>> AND IF SO, DOES HE REGRET 
TRYING TO PUSH FORWARD ON A 
ZERO TOLERANCE APPROACH IN THE 
FIRST PLACE? 
>> THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY 
SUPPORTS KEEPING FAMILIES 
TOGETHER, WHICH HE HAS OUTLINED 
OVER THE LAST WEEK. 
BUT HE HAS CALLED ON CONGRESS 
TO FORWARD-LOOKING THE SYSTEM. 
THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT 
ULTIMATELY HAVE THE ABILITY TO 
CHANGE THE LAW. 
THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDER 
HAS GIVEN A TEMPORARY SOLUTION 
TO THE PROBLEM, BUT IT IS NOT 
PERMANENT AND WE NEED CONGRESS 
TO STEP UP AND DEMOCRATS TO 
STOP PLAYING POLITICAL GAMES, 
DO THEIR JOBS, WORK WITH THIS 
PRESIDENT AND FIX THE PROBLEM 
AT THE BORDER. 
>> Reporter: CAN YOU TALK ABOUT 
WHY YOU TWEETED FROM YOUR 
OFFICIAL ACCOUNT ABOUT THE 
EPISODE FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE 
RESTAURANT? 
>> SURE I WAS RESPONDING TO A 
NUMBER OF NEWS STORIES. 
I HAD BEEN REACHED OUT TO BY A 
DOZEN REPORTERS AND NEWS 
STORIES HAD BEEN ISSUED. 
IT WAS CONSIDERED NEWS OF THE 
DAY, SO I RESPONDED THE WAY I 
WOULD TO ANY OTHER NEWS OF THE 
DAY STORY. 
>> Reporter: JUST BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T SEE A JUDGE DOESN'T MEAN 
YOU DON'T GET DUE PROCESS. 
CAN YOU EXPLAIN IS THAT AND HOW 
THE PRESIDENT ENVISIONS THIS 
WOULD WORK, WHILE STILL 
MAINTAINING WHAT THE 
CONSTITUTION UPHOLDS? 
AND HAVING A SWIFT IMMIGRATION 
SYSTEM. 
>> AGAIN THERE ARE OTHER WAYS 
FOR REMOVAL. 
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL 
ALIENS REMOVED EVERY MONTH THAT 
DON'T SEE JUDGES. 
SOMETIMES THAT IS THROUGH 
VOLUNTEER REMOVAL AND SOMETIMES 
THAT IS THROUGH EXPEDITED 
REMOVAL. 
AGAIN THE PRESIDENT'S ULTIMATE 
GOAL WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE 
ACTUALLY A SECURE BORED AND 
PEOPLE AREN'T COMING INTO THE 
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY, BUT THAT WE 
HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND 
THE PEOPLE THAT COME INTO THE 
COUNTRY COME IN THROUGH A LEGAL 
SYSTEM. 
>> Reporter: WHAT IS THE 
PRESIDENT DOING SPECIFICALLY 
THIS WEEK TO ENSURE CONGRESS 
PASSES A BILL? 
HE SPENT ALL WEEK IN NEVADA OR 
ALL WEEKEND, EXCUSE ME, TALKING 
ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS WANT OPEN 
BORDERS AND CRIME. 
BUT SPECIFICALLY HAS HE MADE 
PHONE CALLS TO REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE WHERE THE 
BILL IS SPEND -- IS PENDING? 
WHAT IS HE DOING, SPECIFICALLY, 
TO TRY TO GET A NEW LAW PASSED 
SPECIFICALLY, OTHER THAN JUST 
RAILING AGAINST THE CURRENT 
LAW? 
>> THE PRESIDENT MET WITH A 
NUMBER OF LAWMAKERS LAST WEEK, 
TALKED WITH SEVERAL OVER THE 
WEEKEND, SOME HE WAS WITH WHILE 
HE WAS TRAVELING. 
LAST WEEK HE MADE AN OPEN 
INVITATION TO DEMOCRAT 
LAWMAKERS THAT THEY WERE 
WELCOME TO COME TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE TO DISCUSS WHAT THEY 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE. 
BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT WANTS 
SOLUTIONS. 
WE HAVE YET TO HAVE ANY OF THEM 
SHOW UP, ACTUALLY WILLING TO 
HAVE CONVERSATIONS, ACTUALLY 
WILLING TO FIX THE PROBLEM. 
INSTEAD THEY WOULD RATHER RANT 
THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO SEE 
SOLUTIONS. 
IT IS CONGRESS' JOB TO DO THAT 
AND WE HAVE LAID OUT CLEARLY WE 
WANT TO BE PART OF THAT AND 
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE IN THAT 
PACKAGE. 
>> CLEARLY THEY AREN'T. 
REPUBLICANS HAVE LAID OUT A 
NUMBER OF PROPOSALS THAT THEY 
SUPPORT. 
THE PRESIDENT VOICED HIS 
SUPPORT FOR THOSE. 
BECAUSE NO DEMOCRAT WILL GET ON 
BOARD AND LAME SUPPORT A 
SOLUTION -- AND SUPPORT A 
SOLUTION. 
>> Reporter: WHAT IS THE 
REPUBLICAN PARTY DOING? 
>> JEFF THESE AREN'T REPUBLICAN 
BILLS. 
THEY MAY HAVE REPUBLICAN 
SPONSORS, BUT THEY SHOULD BE 
BIPARTISAN. 
LOOK THE HOUSE HAS ALREADY 
PASSED OVER 500 PIECES OF 
LEGISLATION. 
BUT THEY CAN'T GET THROUGH THE 
SENATE BECAUSE DEMOCRATS REFUSE 
TO ACTUALLY FIND SOLUTIONS. 
WE HAVE 50 BILLS THAT PASSED 
JUST LAST WEEK TO ADDRESS THE 
OPIOID CRISIS THAT PASSED 
THROUGH THE HOUSE. 
THE SENATE STILL HASN'T TAKEN 
THEM UP. 
HOPEFULLY THEY WILL. 
IF THEY DO THAT WILL SHOW WE 
CAN COME UP WITH BIPARTISAN 
SOLUTIONS AND THAT IS WHAT WE'D 
LIKE TO SEE ON IMMIGRATION AS 
WELL. 
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT SAID 
LAST WEEK AFTER SIGNING THE 
EXECUTIVE ORDER HE BELIEVED THE 
ZERO TOLERANCE WAS STILL 
IMPORTANT. 
THE POINT OF FACT HOW DOES THAT 
SQUARE WITH THE FACT THEY ARE 
NO LONGER REFERRING FOR 
PROSECUTION ANY ADULTS WHO COME 
IN WITH CHILDREN? 
>> AGAIN THIS IS A TEMPORARY 
SOLUTION. 
THIS ISN'T GOING TO LAST. 
CONGRESS STILL HAS TO STEP UP. 
THEY HAVE TO DO THEIR JOB. 
THIS WILL ONLY LAST A SHORT 
AMOUNT OF TIME. 
WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT OF 
SPACE, WE ARE GOING TO RUN OUT 
OF RESOURCES IN ORDER TO KEEP 
PEOPLE TOGETHER AND WE ARE 
ASKING CONGRESS TO PROVIDE 
THOSE RESOURCES AND DO THEIR 
JOB. 
>> Reporter: DOES THAT MEAN AT 
SOME POINT YOU ARE GOING TO 
CHANGE THAT POLICY BACK? 
>> WE ARE NOT CHANGING THE 
POLICY. 
WE ARE SIMPLY OUT OF RESOURCES 
AND AT SOME POINT CONGRESS HAS 
TO DO WHAT THEY WERE ELECTED TO 
DO AND THAT IS SECURE OUR 
BORDER. 
THAT IS STOP THE CRIME COMING 
INTO OUR COUNTRY. 
THE COUNTRY HAS MADE IT 
EXTREMELY CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT 
OPEN BORDERS AND DEMOCRATS NEED 
TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND THEY 
NEED TO WORK WITH REPUBLICANS 
AND FIND SOME SOLUTIONS. 
>> Reporter: YOU MENTIONED THE 
STATE OF RESOURCES AND RUNNING 
OUT OF THEM. 
CAN YOU BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT 
THE WE ARE SOURCES ARE RIGHT 
NOW FOR HOUSING PARENTS AND 
CHILDREN TOGETHER? 
IS THERE ENOUGH HOUSING RIGHT 
NOW? 
WHAT IS BEING DONE? 
>> AGAIN WE ARE LOOKING AT 
EVERY POPPINGS AVAILABLE. 
WE HAVE ASKED THE PENTAGON TO 
HELP WITH ADDITIONAL SPACE. 
BUT A LOT THAT HAV WILL DEPEND 
ON OUR ABILITY TO STOP PEOPLE 
COMING INTO THE COUNTRY 
ILLEGALLY. 
AND WE AGAIN ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
TO GO THROUGH PORTS OF ENTRY 
INSTEAD OF CROSSING THE BORDER 
ILLEGALLY. 
WE HAVE REQUESTED, THROUGH 
LEGISLATION, WE ARE WORKING 
WITH CONGRESS, HOPEFULLY, TO 
PROVIDE MORE RESOURCES AND THE 
ABILITY TO ACTUALLY ENFORCE THE 
LAW. 
>> Reporter: I WANT TO SEE IF 
YOU CAN NARROW DOWN EXACTLY 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY 
INTENDS TO DO WITH THIS IDEA OF 
NOT HAVING JUDGES. 
YOU SAY THAT THERE ARE 
INSTANCES WHERE PEOPLE DON'T 
HAVE JUDGES BUT MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IF YOU 
ASK FOR ASYLUM YOU HAVE CERTAIN 
RIGHTS. 
SO IS THERE GOING TO BE A 
CHANGE IN THAT POLICY? 
OR WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION 
PLANNING TO DO TO MAKE IT SO 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE A JUDGE? 
>> AGAIN, I HAVE ADDRESSED THIS 
A COUPLE OF TIMES. 
THERE ARE MULTIPLE INSTANCES IN 
WHERE YOU WOULDN'T. 
VOLUNTEER REMOVAL, EXPEDITED 
REMOVAL. 
IF SOMEBODY COMES THROUGH A 
PORT OF ENTRY, SEEKING ASYLUM, 
THOSE CASES AND THAT PROCESS 
WILL BE HEARD. 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE 
PRESIDENT'S ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO 
SECURE THE BORED AND STOP 
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. 
>> Reporter: I UNDERSTAND THAT. 
BUT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN 
PRACTICALLY? 
IS THE PRESIDENT PLANNING TO DO 
ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY? 
>> THE PRESIDENT HAS LAID OUT 
WHAT HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. 
WE HAVE PUT OUT THE THINGS WE 
WANT TO SEE IN AN IMMIGRATION 
PACKAGE MONTHS AGO. 
WE ARE STILL WAITING ON 
CONGRESS TO GIVE US THE ABILITY 
TO DO THAT. 
>> Reporter: SO UNLESS CONGRESS 
ACTS NOTHING IS ACTUALLY GOING 
TO CHANGE? 
THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT 
CHANGING ANYTHING RIGHT NOW. 
>> YOU MEAN ARE WE WALKING 
AROUND MAKING UP LAWS? 
NO. 
WE ARE NOT THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION. 
WE ARE TRYING TO ENFORCE THE 
LAWS ON THE BOOKS. 
WE ARE ASKING CONGRESS TO DO 
THEIR PART IN THE PROCESS AND 
PASS NEW LEGISLATION THAT WILL 
FIX OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. 
>> Reporter: NOTHING IS 
CHANGING ON THE GROUND? 
SO THE PRESIDENT IS COMPLAINING 
ABOUT JUDGES AND SAYING WE 
SHOULDN'T HAVE ALL THESE JUDGES 
AND PEOPLE WHO COME OVER SHOULD 
JUST BE PUT OUT BUT NOTHING IS 
ACTUALLY GOING TO CHANGE? 
HE IS JUST COMPLAINING ABOUT 
THE PROCESS AS IT STANDS NOW? 
>> THINGS THAT WE HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO DO ADMINISTRATIVELY 
WE ARE WORKING TO DO. 
BUT AGAIN, CONGRESS IS THE ONLY 
ONE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO 
WRITE LAW AND WE HOPE THEY WILL 
DO IS THAT. 
>> Reporter: I'M TRYING TO úUND 
PRESIDENT UNDERSTANDS ABOUT THE 
CURRENT POLICY. 
AS YOU EXPLAINED, EXPEDITED 
REMOVAL ALLOWS THE GOVERNMENT 
TO REMOVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS 
OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS A YEAR 
WITHOUT SEEING JUDGES. 
DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW THAT 
WHEN HE ISSUED THE TWEETS? 
>> YEAH BUT THERE ARE STILL 
THOUSANDS THAT GO THROUGH A 
VERY LENGTHY PROCESS. 
WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE PROCESS 
CONSOLIDATED, THE BACKLOG 
STOPPED, OUR BORDERS SECURED 
IT. 
>> Reporter: YOU HAVE SAID THAT 
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE 
EXPEDITED REMOVAL. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT INTEND TO 
EXPAND IT TO THE FULL 2-YEAR 
LIMIT UNDER THE CURRENT 
STATUTE? 
>> AGAIN ULTIMATELY, WE WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THE BORDER SECURED 
AND PEOPLE STOP COMING INTO THE 
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY. 
THAT SEEMS PRETTY SIMPLE TO ME 
AND BO STOP A LOT OF THE 
PROBLEMS AND WOULD ELIMINATE 
THE NEED FOR MANY OF THESE 
ADDITIONAL LAWS. 
>>> YOU BEGAN THE BRIEFING 
TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF 
CIVILITY. 
DO YOU CONSIDER IT A CIVIL 
POLICY TO SEPARATE MORE THAN 
2,000 CHILDREN FROM THEIR 
FAMILIES. 
>> WE CONSIDER ENFORCING THE 
LAW THE ROLE THE ADMINISTRATION 
HAS TO PLAY. 
CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT HAS 
TAKEN AN EXECUTIVE ACTION TO 
THE FURTHEST THAT HE HAS THE 
ABILITY TO DO, TO MINIMIZE THE 
SEPARATION OF FAMILIES. 
WE ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE 
SURE FAMILIES GET TO STAY 
TOGETHER AND WE ARE CALLING ON 
CONGRESS TO HELP US IN THAT 
EFFORT, AND WE ARE CONTINUING 
FOCUS ON THE REUNIFICATION AND 
MAKING SURE THAT THE FAMILIES, 
AGAIN, STAY TOGETHER AND THAT 
CONGRESS WILL GIVE US A 
PERMANENT SOLUTION TO FIX THAT. 
>>> 
>> Reporter: IT WAS YOUR 
ADMINISTRATION IN THE FIRST 
PLACE. 
>> IT WASN'T OUR ADMINISTRATION 
THAT CREATED THESE LAWS. 
BUT IT IS OUR ADMINISTRATION'S 
JOB TO ENFORCE IT. 
IF SOMEONE BREAKS THE LAW, IT 
IS OUR JOB TO ENFORCE IT. 
IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T LIKE THE 
LAW, THEY NEED TO LOBBY 
CONGRESS AND ASK THEM TO CHANGE 
IT. 
>> Reporter: ONE IMMIGRATION 
QUESTION. 
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERY 
ADULT WITH A CHILD IS GOING TO 
BE PROSECUTED. 
IF THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT ARE 
BEING HELD TOGETHER, DETAINED 
TOGETHER SOMEWHERE AND 20 DAYS 
GOES BY, WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN THEN? 
I DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER ABOUT 
THAT LAST WEEK. 
THE LAW SAYS YOU CAN'T KEEP THE 
CHILDREN, EVEN WITH PARENTS, 
FOR LONGER THAN 20 DAYS. 
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS? 
>> HOPEFULLY CONGRESS WILL PASS 
A LAW AND FIX THE PROBLEM. 
WHY SHOULD IT BE SO HARD? 
THEY SAUL SAY THEY DON'T WANT 
TO SEPARATE FAMILIES. 
SEEMS SIMPLE TO ME. 
>> Reporter: JEFF ASKED YOU A 
QUESTION ABOUT CONGRESS AND THE 
BILL. 
WERE YOU, IN YOUR RESPONSE, 
REFERRING TO JUST A STAND ALONE 
BILL THAT DEALS WITH FAMILY 
SEPARATION? 
OR WERE YOU REFERRING TO THE 
BIGGER IMMIGRATION BILL THE 
HOUSE HOPES TO TAKE NONE WEEK? 
>> OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE A 
BILL THAT ADDRESSES ALL THE 
PILLARS THAT WE HAVE LAID OUT 
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
ADDRESS IN AN IMMIGRATION 
PACKAGE AND THAT IS WHAT OUR 
FOCUS IS RIGHT NOW. 
THERE IS A BILL THAT DOES THAT 
ON THE TABLE. 
IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, WE'LL 
TALK ABOUT OTHER PIECES OF 
LEGISLATION AT THAT POINT. 
>> THE BE. 
>> Reporter: THE PRESIDENT 
STILL WANTS THAT BILL TO GO 
FORWARD? 
>> DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE CLEAR 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT 
THIS. 
WE NEED AT LEAST SOME DEMOCRATS 
TO GET ON BOARD, THEY HAVE MADE 
IT CLEAR THEY DON'T WANT TO 
WORK WITH THE PRESIDENT, THEY 
DON'T WANT TO FIX OUR 
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM, HELD RATHER 
HAVE OPEN BORDERS AND RAMPANT 
CRIME THAN WORK WITH THE 
PRESIDENT TO CREATE SOLUTIONS. 
UNTIL THEY CHANGE THEIR MIND, 
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 
LOOKING AT THE BEST WAYS WE CAN 
FIX THESE PROBLEMS, BUT WE NEED 
CONGRESS TO HELP US. 
>> Reporter: THIS PRESIDENT IS 
THE FIRST IN THE TELEVISION AGE 
WHO HAS YET TO ADDRESS THE 
AMERICAN PUBLIC ON NATIONWIDE 
TELEVISION FROM THE OVAL 
OFFICE. 
MANY REPUBLICAN CONSULTANTS HE 
MIGHT HAVE A STRONGER HAND IN 
INFLUENCING CONGRESS IF HE MADE 
A NATIONALLY TELEVISED ADDRESS 
ON IMMIGRATION AND WHAT CHANGES 
HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO EXPLAIN 
IT. 
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS ON 
THE TABLE WITHIN THE 
ADMINISTRATION? 
>> CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE 
ANYTHING OFF THE TABLE OR ANY 
TOOL AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENT. 
HE DOES ADDRESS THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 
VENUES AND FORMATS, AND I'LL 
CERTAINLY PASS ALONG THAT 
SUGGESTION TO HIM. 
>> Reporter: 
>> CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THE 
WHITE HOUSE IS HOPING TO 
ACHIEVE SUCCESS IN THE MIDDLE 
EAST TALKS ABOUT THE PRINCIPLE 
PARTY AND NOT TAKING PART? 
>> WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE IN 
THE PEACE PROCESS. 
WE HAD PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS OVER 
THE LAST WEEK AND WE ARE GOING 
TO CONTINUE THOSE 
CONVERSATIONS. 
>> Reporter: TO FOLLOW-UP ON 
THE ISSUE OF THE IMMIGRATION 
JUDGES, WHY IS THE PRESIDENT SO 
OPPOSED TO AN INCREASE IN THE 
NUMBER OF IMMIGRATION JUDGES 
WHEN IT WOULD EXPEDITE AT ISIL 
MELANIA TRUMP PROCESS AND 
DEPORTATION? 
>> WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE 
SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS. 
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE 
TO SEE IS WE STOP THE PROBLEM 
AT THE VERY BEGINNING, SECURE 
THE BORED AND PEOPLE WORK 
THROUGH THE PORTS OF ENTRY, SO 
WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH THINGS 
ON THE BACK END. 
WE'D LIKE TO STOP THE PROBLEM 
BEFORE IT STARTS AND THAT IS 
THE FOCUS SECURING THE BORDER. 
THANKS SO MUCH GUYS, HAVE A 
GREAT DAY. 
>>> THAT WAS SARAH HUCKABEE 
SANDERS ADDRESSING REPORTERS IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING ROOM, 
TOUCHING ON A LOT OF TOPICS 
FROM IMMIGRATION, THAT REALLY 
DOMINATED IT, BUT ALSO TRADE. 
WE SPOKE EARLIER TODAY ABOUT 
HARLEY DAVIDSON MOVING 
PRODUCTION OVERSEAS BECAUSE OF 
TARIFF INCREASES FROM THE EU. 
SHE WAS ASKED ABOUT HER 
EXPERIENCE AT THE RESTAURANT IN 
VIRGINIA, RED HEN, WHERE SHE 
WAS ASKED TO LEAVE. 
>> SHE DID MENTION IT BECAME 
THE NEWS OF THE DAY, WHICH IS 
WHY SHE ADDRESSED IT ON HER 
OFFICIAL E-MAIL. 
IN TERMS OF THE EU TARIFFS, 
SANDERS SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT 
THE PROBLEM WAS WITH THE 
EUROPEAN UNION AND DIDN'T PLACE 
ANY BLAME ON HARLEY DAVIDSON 
FOR THE REPORTS THEY ARE GOING 
TO BE MOVING A BIG PART OF 
THEIR PRODUCTION TO EUROPE. 
>> NO MENTION THAT THESE ARE 
RECIPROCAL. 
REALLY THE DISCUSSION FOCUSED 
ON IMMIGRATION. 
THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE WANTS 
CLARITY O WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO 
THESE FAMILIES? 
HOW MANY HAVE BEEN REUNITED? 
AND WHAT HAPPENS NOW AFTER 20 
DAYS THAT, WHERE SUPPOSEDLY 
THESE FAMILIES WILL HAVE THAT 
CAP PUT ON THEM. 
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? 
>> CBS NEWS WASHINGTON 
CORRESPONDENT PAULA REID JOINS 
US NOW. 
LET'S START WITH THAT QUESTION. 
YOU KNOW, ANITA KUMAR TRIED TO 
GET CLARITY ABOUT WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN TO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES 
WHO ARE DETAINED TOGETHER AFTER 
THAT 20-DAY LIMIT ASKED UP -- 
LIMIT IS UP. 
SANDERS WAS EVASIVE. 
>> Reporter: ABSOLUTELY. 
CONGRESS COULD PASS SOME SORT 
OF NEW LAW THAT WOULD OVERRIDE 
THAT RESTRICTION THAT, CHILDREN 
CAN ONLY BE HELD FOR 20 DAYS. 
BUT LET'S BE REAL. 
IT SEEMS INCREDIBLY UNREALISTIC 
CONGRESS IS GOING TO PASS 
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION 
REFORM IN WHAT IS LESS THAN 20 
DAYS. 
THERE IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY. 
THAT IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 
HAS ASKED A FEDERAL JUDGE IN 
CALIFORNIA TO MODIFY THAT 
RULING TO ALLOW THE 
ADMINISTRATION TO HOLD FAMILIES 
TOGETHER, SO THEY CONTINUE TO 
ENFORCE THEIR ZERO TOLERANCE 
POLICY. 
BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING TO 
SEPARATE CHILDREN AND PARENTS, 
THEY COULD HOLD THEM TOGETHER. 
BUT IT IS INCREDIBLY 
UNREALISTIC THAT JUDGE IS GOING 
TO MODIFY THAT LAW, BECAUSE 
THAT JUDGE HAS ALREADY REVIEWED 
THIS PARTICULAR PROVISION AND 
UPHELD IT. 
SO FAR FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE NOT 
BEEN WILLING TO ENDORSE THE 
INDEFINITE DETENTION OF MINORS
