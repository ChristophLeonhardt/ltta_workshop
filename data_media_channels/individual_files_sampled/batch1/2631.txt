in the last year this has really become a reality on a major scale in Lancaster California describe how big the installation is how much power it produces how does that compare to fossil fuel power production what we did was take the concept of having multiple mirrors track using a lot of software and made a prototype on our own roof top on this building right here we had ten mirrors tracking on the roof about six months after our concept then we went out to the desert and we rented some land and we built a facility with 500 mirrors to test whether it would work at full scale that test worked so in the middle of 2008 we began construction of a 24,000 mayor facility which is about an hour away from here in Lancaster California those 24 thousand mirrors all shine their sunlight each one is about one square meter but the size of a plasma screen TV mirrors are about that size and shape they all reflect their sunlight to a single central tower this is on 20 acres of land so imagine a field 20 acres it used to be a farm used to be a carrot farm 20 acres of carrot farm now have 20 acres of mirrors all shining their sunlight to a single spot that spot gets so hot it would instantly melt steel steel would instantly be dripping down to the ground if we weren't running water through it very fast to cool the steel but turn the water to steam that power plant puts out five megawatts of electricity so 24,000 mirrors on 20 acres produces five megawatts of electricity we are now going to replicate that all over the world and we have orders all over the world right now and how much electricity is five megawatt five megawatts is enough to power about 4,000 homes an electricity that we're making at that plant right now we're selling to Southern California Edison Southern California's and then puts it onto the grid and powers the homes in lancaster and palmdale california
