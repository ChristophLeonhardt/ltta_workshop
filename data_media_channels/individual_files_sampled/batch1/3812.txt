I've dreamt of this next section of the route for so many years to be up here 23,000 feet staring up the ridge to the summit pretty cool how high up life just manages to kind of exist this is hair by Everest of the new hashtag it's a thing here by Everest it's a thing I think mine's better than his so the pigs pretty straightforward a lot of times it's too cold to go outside of your tent or sleeping bag so we actually just use bottles these flexible bottles pee in them and then dump it out outside so that gets left on the mountain a lot of people are super curious about bathroom duties This Is It this is a pee bottle that's two liters that's last night the solid waste is a little more complicated yeah solid waste is a fun one the way our team took care of our waste was we use actually biodegradable bags and we'd go in the bag so they're quite big you'd tie it in a knot you put it in another bag it was a very strong ziploc and then you'd carry that off the mountain with you on your way down so everything that happened up there went down and and that the bags themselves like we said they're biodegradable so even if it gets disposed of just in the bag that will break down really quickly so we do have an estimate of calories we think on the summit day you might we might have burned up to 20,000 calories an average climbing day is probably eight to ten thousand calories and I bet on an average day we were putting into our bodies somewhere between a thousand and 1500 calories and that's why we look a little more svelte than normal high cheekbones
