1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:02,675
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.

2
00:00:02,675 --> 00:00:05,878
>> Neil: HE'S NOT RED OR BLUE.

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:06,379
HE'S GREEN.

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,647
I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS.

5
00:00:07,647 --> 00:00:08,815
IT'S HILLARY CLINTON COMMENTING

6
00:00:08,815 --> 00:00:11,651
ON WHAT HAPPENED IN THE 2016

7
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:12,018
ELECTION.

8
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:13,252
SHE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.

9
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:14,954
YOUR REACTION TO THIS.

10
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:16,122
>> CAN'T BLAME HER.

11
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:21,461
>> THE IOWA CAUCUSES AND 41% OF

12
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:23,696
DEMOCRATS ARE SOCIALISTS, AND

13
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:26,399
I'M ASKED ARE YOU A CAPITALIST

14
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:29,902
AND I SAY YES WITH APPROPRIATE

15
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:30,369
ACCOUNTABILITY.

16
00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:31,704
THAT PROBABLY GETS LOST IN THE

17
00:00:31,704 --> 00:00:33,673
OH, MY GOSH, SHE'S A CAPITALIST.

18
00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:35,441
>> Neil: WHAT DID YOU THINK OF

19
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:35,741
THAT?

20
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:37,410
>> I THINK SHE'S STILL TRYING TO

21
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,678
FIGURE OUT WHAT WENT WRONG, WHAT

22
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,045
HAPPENED.

23
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:40,780
>> Neil: DO YOU THINK SHE'S A

24
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,180
CAPITALIST?

25
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,484
>> SURE.

26
00:00:44,617 --> 00:00:47,854
SHE SUPPORTS THE SYSTEM.

27
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:51,057
SHE BELIEVES IN CAPITALISM.

28
00:00:51,057 --> 00:00:52,859
>> Neil: SHE AND HER HUSBAND ARE

29
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,327
VERY RICH.

30
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:56,829
ARE YOU A CAPITALIST?

31
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:58,598
>> I BELIEVE IN CAPITALISM.

32
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:01,100
SHE LOST THE BERNIE SANDERS

33
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,702
VOTERS BECAUSE HE'S A SOCIALIST.

34
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:04,203
THAT IS A KEY PHRASE THAT WOULD

35
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:05,004
HAVE WON NEW HAMPSHIRE, WOULD

36
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:08,274
HAVE HELPED HER WITH THE YOUNGER

37
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:10,243
VOTERS THAT THINK CAPITALISM IS

38
00:01:10,243 --> 00:01:10,743
A BAD WORD.

39
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,778
>> Neil: SHE MIGHT BE RIGHT ON

40
00:01:12,778 --> 00:01:13,546
THAT.

41
00:01:13,546 --> 00:01:15,515
POLITICALLY, ESPECIALLY IN THE

42
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:18,184
GO-ROUND IN THIS NEXT ELECTION.

43
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:19,385
YOU CAN MAKE AN ARGUMENT THAT

44
00:01:19,385 --> 00:01:22,421
EVEN BREATHING THAT WORD IS NOT

45
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:22,822
ACCEPTABLE.

46
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:23,890
>> IT'S TRUE.

47
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,025
A CAPITALIST DID BECOME

48
00:01:26,025 --> 00:01:26,392
PRESIDENT.

49
00:01:26,392 --> 00:01:28,394
SHE WAS EVENTUALLY THE NOMINEE

50
00:01:28,394 --> 00:01:30,463
IN THE PRIMARY.

51
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:31,864
IT WAS ABOUT HER ASSUMING THAT

52
00:01:31,864 --> 00:01:36,502
SHE WOULD BE ELEVATED TO THE

53
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:38,204
PRESIDENCY INSTEAD OF WORKING

54
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:42,275
HARD FOR IT, WHICH IS A TENANT

55
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:45,144
OF CAPITALISM.

56
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:47,013
>> Neil: THE RAP ABOUT

57
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:48,614
DEMOCRATS, THEY DON'T LIKE

58
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:49,015
CAPITALISM.

59
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:51,017
THEY THINK COMPANIES ARE GETTING

60
00:01:51,017 --> 00:01:52,184
AWAY WITH MURDER.

61
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:53,953
THAT THEY DON'T HELP OUT THE

62
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:54,387
WORKERS.

63
00:01:54,387 --> 00:01:56,022
>> YOU MEAN CORPORATIONS.

64
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:58,758
WHICH GOES BACK TO SEATTLE.

65
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:01,260
SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT AMAZON

66
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,462
WOULD WANT TO DO THE RIGHT

67
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:03,996
THING --

68
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:05,164
>> Neil: BUT DO YOU HAVE THE

69
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,066
VIEW OF CEOs --

70
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:08,967
>> NO, NOT IF THEY DO THE RIGHT

71
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:09,301
THING.

72
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,169
>> Neil: WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION

73
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,103
OF THE RIGHT THING?

74
00:02:11,103 --> 00:02:13,973
>> WHAT HILLARY SAID IN AN

75
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:14,840
INTERVIEW, PEOPLE BELIEVE

76
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,375
THERE'S SUCH INEQUALITY.

77
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:19,145
THE BOSSES ARE GETTING THE MONEY

78
00:02:19,145 --> 00:02:22,548
AND THERE'S WAGE INEQUALITY WITH

79
00:02:22,548 --> 00:02:24,417
WOMEN AND MEN THAT CAPITOLISM IS

80
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:25,785
LOOKING SO BAD --

81
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:26,819
>> Neil: AND IT'S TO THE

82
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:31,090
GOVERNMENT TO FORCE AND FAIR AND

83
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,857
NARROW THAT GAME.

84
00:02:31,857 --> 00:02:34,060
>> SHE SAID THE WAY BERNIE

85
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,027
SANDERS EXPLAINS THE SOCIALISM

86
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:36,262
IN THE FREE UNIVERSITIES AND

87
00:02:36,262 --> 00:02:37,563
DOING THE RIGHT THING --

88
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:38,864
>> Neil: SO IF YOU EARN TOO

89
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:40,566
MUCH, YOU WOULDN'T MIND SOMEONE

90
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:43,069
IN THE GOVERNMENT SAYING NO, NO,

91
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:43,936
I'D GIVE IT BACK.

92
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:46,072
>> GIVING BACK AS A COMPANY.

93
00:02:46,072 --> 00:02:47,440
>> Neil: YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL,

94
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,407
YOU'RE TOO WEALTHY.

95
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:49,642
>> I BELIEVE WE HAVE ENOUGH

96
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:50,076
TAXES ALREADY.

97
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:52,011
THEY SHOULD BE ALLOCATED

98
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:52,445
APPROPRIATELY.

99
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:55,448
WE HAVE ENOUGH TAXES TO GO

100
00:02:55,448 --> 00:02:55,781
AROUND.

101
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:57,483
>> Neil: WHAT IS A GOOD

102
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:59,418
ACCEPTABLE RATE YOU THINK THE

103
00:02:59,418 --> 00:03:01,087
RICH SHOULD PAY?

104
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:02,221
>> WE HAVE ENOUGH --

105
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:03,656
>> Neil: I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID.

106
00:03:03,656 --> 00:03:05,124
YOU OBVIOUSLY FEEL THAT PEOPLE

107
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:07,059
LIKE CHARLES DON'T PAY ENOUGH.

108
00:03:07,059 --> 00:03:08,761
>> YOU TOLD ME IN THE GREEN

109
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:09,729
ROOM --

110
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:10,930
>> I BELIEVE YOU SHOULD PAY

111
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:11,230
MORE.

112
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,964
SO I --

113
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:13,165
>> Neil: THAT'S THE BATTLE

114
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:16,669
ROYALE IN THE NEXT ELECTION YET

115
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:17,436
AGAIN.

116
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:18,304
>> IT WILL BE.

117
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:20,773
THE NOTION OF -- LISTEN, WE KNOW

118
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:23,142
THERE'S LARGE CORPORATIONS THAT

119
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:24,610
SHOOT THEMSELVES IN THE FOOT.

120
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,746
POOR BOARDS OF DIRECTORS THAT

121
00:03:26,746 --> 00:03:28,581
PAY -- GE.

122
00:03:28,581 --> 00:03:29,649
JEFF IMMELT.

123
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:31,017
LIKE WHAT HE DID TO THAT COMPANY

124
00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:31,951
AND THE STOCK.

125
00:03:31,951 --> 00:03:35,588
HE MADE A LOT OF MONEY.

126
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:37,723
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S LEGITIMATE

127
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:38,024
ANGER.

128
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:39,825
THEY'RE PRIVATE ENTITIES.

129
00:03:39,825 --> 00:03:41,260
IF THEY WANT TO RUIN THEMSELVES

130
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,262
BY REWARDING BAD BEHAVIOR --

131
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,964
>> SHOULD BE GOOD BEHAVIOR.

132
00:03:44,964 --> 00:03:46,432
>> Neil: AND IT WOULD BE LIKE ME

133
00:03:46,432 --> 00:03:48,067
OFFERING YOU DIETARY ADVICE.

134
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:48,768
I WOULDN'T.

135
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:50,603
>> THANK YOU.

136
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:51,504
>> Neil: THE GOVERNMENT OFFERING

137
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,606
ANYBODY FINANCIAL ADVICE IS A

138
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:54,306
SLIPPERY SLOPE.

139
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:55,041
>> YEAH.

140
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:55,975
THE GOVERNMENT KNOW WHAT'S

141
00:03:55,975 --> 00:00:00,000
THEY'RE DOING, DON'T
