- My name is Jesse, and I wanted to ask you about Spanish language mainstream meet conservative media. So at this point in 2018, we still have over 41 million Spanish speakers all across the United States, second only to Mexico in terms of Spanish speaking population worldwide, 15 million in California. Yet we still don't have any kind of conservative media in Spanish on any kind of mainstream or even alternate media basis. There's only very disparate YouTube channels or Facebook pages and what have you. I was wondering two things. One is why is this still the case? Second, I was wondering if you and Daily Wire would be interested in being able to make a shift in the culture and a shift in our country in being pioneers in this venture, and was wondering if I could partner with you? I grew up as a Christian missionary kid in Lima, Peru in South America, so I'm a US citizen and grew up overseas, dual citizen of US and Peru. I'm fully bilingual in English and Spanish, also in French as well 'cause I was a missionary in France. - Yeah, the answer to your question is absolutely, send us a resume. Conservatism is not limited to one language. (audience cheering) When I spoke at the California Republican Party, I gave the keynote address to the California Convention probably five years ago, I actually suggested that everybody in the room ought to try learning Spanish. I'm working on it right now, I've been working on it for years, I keep failing, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be reaching out in other languages, so yes, send us a resume, absolutely.
