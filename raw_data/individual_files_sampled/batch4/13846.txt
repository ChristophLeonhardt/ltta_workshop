perhaps you witnessed some of the theatrics surrounding Cavanaugh's confirmation this weekend if you happen to turn on the news you would have seen it leftists were losing their mind as usual nothing nothing new about that as we have seen anytime there's a mob of people throwing a hissy fit it is almost always a leftist mob I don't know if you've noticed that but it is almost always if there's a riot if there are people screaming in the street if there are people burning down buildings turning over cop cars whatever it is destruction of property making fool themselves it's almost always left that's the one exception the one exception I can think of in recent history would be the one or two white nationalist rallies that we've seen and really really only just the one in there was really the one that was big and chaotic so that's one one exception aside from those it's always leftist but the one thing the one image that kind of stands out from this past weekend in terms of the protests especially is the image of the people I don't know if you saw this but there are people literally after the cough after Kavanagh was officially confirmed there are people literally clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court it was like something out of The Walking Dead you had these people screaming just these gutter all kind of unhuman sounding demonically possessed screams while they were clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court I mean some of them are trying to knock that they were running into the door trying to knock it over doors which by the way look to be made of stone and probably weigh a couple tons apiece but in their impotent rage they thought they could break down the doors or claw them open and to what end I'm not sure do they think that the Supreme Court justices actually live inside the Supreme Court building is that what they think do they think that that we keep them all they're like cryogenically frozen and then we follow them out for every session I think that might actually be the case with Ruth Bader Ginsburg but but generally people live in homes I don't know what even if you could manage to claw open a stone door I don't know what you think that would accomplish I'm not sure but it really is it's it's we can laugh about it we have to laugh about it right because number one it's hilarious but number two what else are you gonna do but as we're laughing we have to recognize that this is real I mean these are real people who are behaving this way and this is not uncommon anymore we've gotten to the point where we can no longer say oh it's an aberration it's just a few of them this is very common at any time things don't go the way left this want whether it's an election Supreme Court confirmation a grand jury you know a trial of a cop accused of shooting somebody whatever it is whatever news whatever item in the news they don't like this is how they respond every time it's not an exaggeration
