it's a cool idea it's good science fiction but getting to another star system is not trivial it is reasonable that there is such a thing as a wormhole through interstellar space but as far as anybody knows it would kill you because the amount of gravity the difference but the gravity between your feet in your head would stretch you into as the saying goes a piece of spaghetti know that you'd be dead but it is charming science fiction I mean I grew up on Star Trek everybody speaks English they beam up and down there's gravity all over the place it's good and to those of us who claim they want to go live on Mars they want to be pioneers on Mars Mars is a fantastically hostile place if you really think you want to live on Mars go to Antarctica go to the drive not to shore where the Penguins are jumping in the orcas or just napping no go to where it hasn't rained and over or snowed in over a century and just to make just to make sure you're in it take your own scuba tanks to breathe don't breathe the air there either I very much want to go to Mars and come back I would like to explore Mars with my rock hammer and the right microscope and lenses to look for some microbes but I want to come back do you know the motto of the state of California Eureka I found it so these guys come over the hill there's orange trees or like weeds fish like this salmon are falling in your lap out of the Sacramento River if it gets to the point where the the rocks are made of gold they have a gold rush I mean it's out of hand when you go to Mars it ain't like that man if you open the door you're dead instantly however if we were to discover evidence of life on Mars it would change the world change the world their economic reasons to do it maybe you want to mine an asteroid you want to be tomorrow's first trillionaire that person is going to be the one who mines asteroids first these are the nearby targets but the more distant target
