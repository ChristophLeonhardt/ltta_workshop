telecom Giants in the u.s. are set for a major victory if Washington goes ahead with its plan to repeal so-called net neutrality rules that's likely to have a direct impact on internet speeds in the United States here's how it works currently internet providers have to give equal access to all on-line content at all so it all really loads at the same speed now if net neutrality scruffed the US Federal Communications Commission will allow the telecom firms to prioritize connections to some companies more than others now the FCC Chairman argues that the rules in place Nara preventing trillions of dollars being invested into web services by the private sector but the downside for consumers is that it's going to mean some websites and streaming services will work much faster than others essentially creating a digital slow lane for firms who can't afford to pay to get their speeds boosted we discussed the potential impact with political activist George barter under the current rules in in the u.s. internet access is is framed as a public utility and I think most people given the the huge significance of information traveling on the Internet - you know most lived modern lives it is very very important that that is available to everybody freely you know just as much as water access to energy to heat homes etc this is very much a crucial part of modern life what this means in practice of course is if this moves ahead that if you go to a website that isn't favored that can't pay the huge fees to get fast access to the Internet and then anyone that goes to that site and wants to watch a two-minute video could end up sitting there for 15 minutes and it's buffering and so they give up essentially and they move to another site that has paid the huge fees so this does have enormous implications I think for the integrity of the political conversation going forward
