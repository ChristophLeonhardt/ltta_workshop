C

82
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,695
SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS WHICH ARE 

83
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,929

ADDICTION.

86
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,567
WHAT I CONSTANTLY HEAR IS THE 

87
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:23,302
NEED FOR SUPPORT AT ALL LEVELS, 

88
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:26,005
LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS OUR

90
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,043
NECESSARY TO STOP CRIMINALS FROM

91
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,613
PUTTING DRUGS ON THE STREETS.

92
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,081
FAMILIES NEED THE RESOURCES TO

00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:38,451
GET TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP CARE

94
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:41,220
FOR LOVED ONES.

95
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,457
THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED NEED THE 

96
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,058

TO KNOW THEY ARE FIGHTING A 

98
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:51,464
DISEASE AND SHOULD NOT BE 

99
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:51,864
ASHAMED.

100
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:55,400
YOUNG MOTHERS NEED THE SUPPORT

103
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,875

BABIES BORN ADDICTED NEED THE 

106
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,412

107
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,914
ALSO NEED FOLLOW-UP CARE FOR 

108
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,683
YEARS TO COME.

>> MY SOURCES WERE CONCERNED, 

238
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:45,918
WHEN WE LEARNED ABOUT THE 

239
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:46,552
CLINTON PACKAGE AND THE PACKAGE 

240
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,219
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA MORE COULD BE

00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,738
POLITICAL VIOLENCE HAVE NO PLACE

248
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:06,839
IN THE UNITED STATES.

249
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,474
QUITE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'VE 

250
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,108
SEEN ON THE STUMP. 

251
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,977

00:10:11,977 --> 00:10:15,014
HE SAID WE HAVE TO UNIFY AND 

253
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:15,848
COME TOGETHER.

254
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,483
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE MOTIVE 

255
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,685
IS OR WHO THE SUSPECTS ARE.

256
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,787
THE TARGETS ARE -- THE COMMON 

257
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:27,159
THREAT IS ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE

FREQUENT COMMENTERS OR CRITICS 

260
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:32,764
OF THE PRESIDENT.

261
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:38,738
MAXINE WATERS IS SOMEONE THE 

262
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,906
PRESIDENT CALLS LOW IQ.

263
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,309
CNN WAS THE POINT OF A CHANT, 

264
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:50,382
THE WHOLE ARENA WAS CHANTING CNN

265
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:50,582
SLURS.

266
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,351
WE WILL KEEP OUR EYES ON 

267
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:55,187
PRESIDENT TRUMP AS HE HEADS TO

00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:59,491
RALLY TO SEE IF HE TAMPS DOWN 

270
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,962
THIS TONE AT THE HEAT OF THE 

271
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:03,329
MIDTERM RACE. 

272
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,396
>> THE PRESIDENT DETERMINED TO 

273
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:06,398
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

274
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,334
HE SAID THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE 

275
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,935
GOVERNMENT IS BEING DEPLOYED TO 

276
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,671
FIND OUT WHO IS BEHIND THE 

277
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:12,904
ATTACKS.
