You're standing inside a
simulation of the interior of a
star, similar to our sun.
The blue strands you see
represent the sun's magnetic field.
A second set can be seen above in
the opposite hemisphere of the sun.
The convection of plasma flows
inside the sun generates its
magnetic field. These flows
are shown as blue and red
shapes, with blue representing
flows moving towards the center
of the sun, and red flows moving
outward toward the surface.
Here you can see the polarity of the
magnetic field beginning to shift,
shown by the change in color of
the strands as they change from
blue to white and then finally red.
Now the polarity of the field
has fully reversed as shown by
the red color of the magnetic
fields in both hemispheres.
The sun's magnetic field
reverses every 11 years,
a process which is accompanied
by solar storms that can
interrupt power grids and
satellite communications.
Researchers said their model
could provide insight that will
help better forecast the strength
of future solar activity cycles.
By understanding future activity
cycles, scientists could better
equip satellites to survive the
onslaught of solar storms.
