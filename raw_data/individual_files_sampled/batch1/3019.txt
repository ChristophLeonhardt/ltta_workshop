once you get the cost down and you can demonstrate parity at a max level what's that barrier then the biggest barrier to this is project finance so let me explain to you a little bit about the economics when you build a gas-fired power plant or a coal plant you build it for say a billion dollars and then over the next 20 years you buy fuel the fuel you buy for that plant over that 20-year period is probably five or ten million dollars it's way more than the capex cost of the plant up front maybe eighty percent of the cost of the plant is paid for over 20 years I went 20 percent is paid upfront with a solar power plant the fuel is solar it's free so you're building the whole plant up front so maybe you'll spend eight billion dollars upfront to build the whole plant and then over the 20 years will only be about 1 billion dollars of maintenance and other costs to keep the plant up to date keep it people working at the plant keep it operating so you're spending most of the money upfront and very little overtime even if we exceed grid parity and the net present value of the cost upfront it beats the cost of the coal plant or the fossil fuel plant over the 20-year period we still have to raise more money so there's still more money needed even if it's a good bargain even if it's a great IRR which we have achieved we still have to have access to capital so when the world isn't lending when banks are retrenching is very difficult to get these plants financed we pretty much have to find people with deep pockets to get these plants to go forward so we really need a capital influx to renewable energy even at a great economic return to make the world change and as you go and try to raise money for particular installations what's the receptivity and there are people eager to invest in this are they still scared to death because it's renewable and so forth is it getting easier the receptivity is very high people are very bullish on this and there's been a huge shift as you know from venture capital dollars from pure IT and biotech to IT biotech and clean tech that's a whole new thing I mean that wasn't even done pretty much before 2000 and post 2004 it's become the fastest growing segment of venture capital so there is absolutely interest from the venture capital side there are funds available the challenge is it's such a new science and such a new technology to existing venture capitalists that the due diligence process is challenging because they're not as familiar with it you think of an executive who came out of Intel who grew up at Intel and is now doing an evaluation on a new semiconductor company well he knows exactly how to do that because that's what he did his whole career you take that same executive he's a smart executive but now he has a big learning curve to get up to really understand the economics in clean tech all of the risk factors risk factors are completely different they're just harder to evaluate so I think over time maybe within a decade we'll have enough new VCS who have grown up from this industry with enough experience to be able do the due diligence more efficiently but we're not there yet I think that's the big bottleneck right now
