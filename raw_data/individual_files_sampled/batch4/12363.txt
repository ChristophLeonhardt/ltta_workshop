on Thursday left-wing fact-checker PolitiFact a site known more for its biases than its quality fact-checking stepped into a pile of doodoo once again this time they blasted President Trump with a fake news fact check that demonstrates just how dishonest they are here is there a headline White House tweet wrongly says Obamacare led to fewer insurance options and they mostly false so what did the White House say that was so wrong Trump said quote Obamacare has led to fewer health insurance options for millions of Americans this is indisputably true just yesterday Anthem Blue Cross pulled out of the Obamacare exchanges in Wisconsin in Indiana health insurance rates have risen dramatically at CNBC reported last week quote as many as 1,200 counties are projected to have just one such insurer next year more counties could be left bare or with just one insurer in coming weeks as insurers announce their intentions unquote and this doesn't take into account the fact that many Obama care plans have cut patients off from their doctors if you like your doctor you couldn't keep your doctor those who have been added to the insurance rolls under Obamacare aren't actually buying health insurance for the most part they're being forced under Medicaid by lack of options so instead of dealing with that claim PolitiFact made up an unrelated claim that the number of on that the number of insured had dropped overall nobody said that though if you count Medicaid coverage which doesn't actually improve health outcomes the numbers are up but that's not what Trump claimed here's PolitiFact admitting the truth all the way at the bottom of their little fact check quote the soil threat of truth is that what the insurance exchanges set up by the law the number of carriers has wind 'old oh you mean the only claim here that Trump made was true and then you made up a series of alternative claims you knock down PolitiFact is ridiculous their drive to check fake news from the left only makes them purveyors of that same fake news I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay so they finally just released the Senate healthcare version the Obamacare and quote-unquote repeal it is not a repeal it is even more of a trash heap than the House version that passed I was very critical of that version version one was really bad version two was slightly less bad the Senate version is really quite crappy it's going to pass probably and the reason that it will pass I would think is because of two things one it defund Planned Parenthood and two it basically allows Republicans to go out there and claim that they repealed Obamacare when they did no such thing but we'll talk about that a little while after I want to discuss Trump in Iowa but before we do any of those things I first want to say thank you to our sponsors over at my Patriot supply so if you are a smart person you know that you also prepare for emergencies there are going to be situations in life where there's some

should do it just to be the responsible person that you are okay so I do want to talk about the Senate version of Trump Care / Obamacare repeal before we get to that I think it's important to talk about the Democrats and their aftermath of their reaction to the loss of John Asaf in Georgia sixth against karen handel so finally all of the conflict has been brewing under the surface of the resistance is broken open the hatred for Trump covered up the fact that the Democrats really have nothing in common anymore there are three branches of the Democratic Party and they are at war with one another one is the Bernie Sanders branch this is the Progressive Socialist Michael Moore branch of the party that says capitalism is evil and we need to redistribute all the income and all the problems in the country are created by income inequality these people are not intersectional politicians they believe that socialistic redistribution ISM is the solution and that the Democratic Party has to universally move towards the left that's branch number one branch number two are the intersectional politician this would be like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton both of these politicians their principles are a little bit all over the place they're often left obviously but they tend to differ on certain basic functions of government but they all agree that America is a terrible place where human beings are separated by race and sex and sexual orientation see the intersection unless you believe that they're going to cobble together this new coalition of people who have been victimized by the American system in order to win elections so again group number one the Sanders people they say we move to the left we'll win and then you'll group number two and these are the the Obama people and they say we need our intersectional hierarchy the Hillary people we need our intersectional hierarchy and then there's group number three and group number three are the Seth Moulton of the world this is the Democratic Congress person from Massachusetts who's making the rounds yesterday because he said what we need is a broader tent party where we have some pro-life Democrats where we have some people who are not so anti business where we are not universally Nancy Pelosi Democrat and these three factions are now at war with one another and that's breaking out into the open because Democrats for the first time are realizing that it's not enough just to scream at president Trump alone it's going to get them most of the way but if they have no unity if they can't figure out what they're doing then they've got a problem Rahm Emanuel acknowledged that they are in serious trouble he says we are 1,000 seats behind as the former chief of staff for President Obama we are a thousand seats shorter to date than we were two oh nine or 208 this is not about one election it's about building a party building an apparatus okay so they're finally realizing they have bad news but the problem is their response to that was Trump is colluding with Russia when Hilary lost their immediate response was we have to resist what are we resisting well we can't say what his agenda is because we don't know what is Genda is from hasn't actually done anything major at this point so it resists him he's a putin's stooge the one problem an entire theory is following apart jeh Johnson who is the former homeland security secretary under President Obama helps contribute to the collapse of the Democrats key talking point that trump is some sort of Russian stooge not beyond what has been out there open-source and not beyond anything that I'm sure this committee has already seen and heard before directly from the intelligence community it's the only thing I'd have on that is derivative of what the intelligence community has and the law enforcement community okay so you can see that with that narrative falling apart they now have to come up with a new narrative so on the one hand you have the people who are who are more in favor of this broad tent democratic party that's the one that's actually going to be better for Democrats right this would be kind of the Joe Biden wing of the party we need to get beyond intersectional politics representative Dingell who I guess replaced I think she replaced her husband right is Debbie Dingell she spoke with MSNBC yesterday and she talked about this she said that basically we need to get beyond the intersectional Obama era and we need to move toward a more a more solid era of we're all Americans and this is what Democrats do if they were smart but they're not so here's Debbie Dingell from Michigan if we don't figure out how we become we again we're going to keep losing so I think it's important that we need to understand each of these groups past issues so she says we can't be African Americans for for Obama or for Hillary we can't be Hispanic Americans for Obama or Hillary we have to just be we again and this is true right this is the real reason that Trump won the reason Trump won is because he wasn't insulting Americans by categorizing them into small groups and then implying that there was this broad vast white mass out there those out to get them that's the real reason the Trump won it wasn't about his populist politics it wasn't about tariffs was mad at stuff gay wasn't about Ross dude had in the and the tax credits that Trump would give to particular businesses in the Rust Belt it was about the fact that Trump did not patronize a bunch of white voters by telling them they hated black and Hispanic people that's what actually happened here so you have this wing of the party the W Dingell wing that is starting to figure it out unfortunately for Debbie Dingell that's being undercut by the Bernie Sanders wing to the Bernie Sanders wing says that Nancy Pelosi should continue to rule the party Nancy Pelosi is a wonderful far-left politician who's just done yeoman's work even though it was Nancy Pelosi's name just being dropped a couple of times in the Georgia six that led to the Democratic defeat Pappagallo says we can't get rid of Nancy Pelosi we need Nancy Pelosi but every time that he was please click defense event there was a Mount Rushmore for speakers Nancy Pelosi would be on it she passed national health care even Franklin Roosevelt could not do that I mean she is so important we need to keep her we need to run far to the left we need to become the Bernie Sanders party so that's wing number two and then finally there is the intersectional wing so what here's what Democrats need to unify okay so and this is where it's kind of interesting what's going on right now because I think it plays into what Democrats need in order to unify what Democrats need in order to unify is not only for Trump to be unpopular but for there to be some piece of legislation that they can all jump on and smack him with so in 1994 Bill Clinton was very unpopular but it took Hillary care and the threat of Hillary care to lead to this vast Republican wave that wiped out 60 seats in the in the house for Democrats and led to the rise of the Republican majority in the house that has basically been steady with with the brief period between oh 6 and 10 since 1994 so the fact is that you need two things in order for the outer party the out of power party to take over what they need is an unpopular president number one and then that that goes into mess and then you need an enzyme to catalyze the resistance and that is some piece of unpopular legislation well so far Trump hasn't actually done anything right so far the only thing he's done is nominating Al Gore such and that's not enough of a slap Democrats for them to really catalyze around it for them to coagulate around that and then become the quote/unquote resistance and so Chuck Schumer is interested in Obamacare appeal he thinks that the Democrats are going to be able to whip the the base into a fury over the repeal of the supposed repeal of Obamacare we're going to look at every single thing and find out the best way but this is full-scale warfare this is the most important advancement since probably Medicare in terms of helping people and we're not going to be complacent or go along or business as usual in any way so Democrats need something to oppose they need Trump not just to be Trump they need Trump to actually push a big piece of Legends relation that is unpopular fortunately for them it looks like the Senate is about to do that so the Senate just dropped their health care bill and the Senate health care bill is just a disaster the Senate health care bill it cuts some of the Obamacare taxes but the problem is then it doesn't pay for all the subsidies that it's giving it's preserving virtually all of the Obamacare subsidies it's increasing subsidies in certain areas it cuts Medicaid but it only does that down the road and those cuts were never going to materialize it enshrines the Obamacare central regulations in place will Republicans pass it as I said I think they probably will because I think that Republicans are stupid and they just want the immediate headline that they repealed Obamacare even though that means they now own what comes next they also want to be able to say to their constituency that they repealed all the funding for Planned Parenthood although again is that a big enough deal to is that is that a huge enough advance for the Republicans who own Obamacare for the foreseeable future no it's sort of reminiscent of what President Trump did with illegal immigration he said that he was going to get rid of DAPA which is the protection for parents of illegal immigrants who came in when they were children he got rid he said he's getting rid of DAPA which wasn't even in place and then he Brehon shrined daca which was Obama's executive amnesty Republicans are basically reinsuring Obama care and then calling it Obamacare repeal which is the worst of all available world even the creator even the creator of Obamacare Jonathan Gruber remember he's the guy who was caught on tape saying yes we lied to the American public about what Obamacare was going to do even he is now out there saying that this Senate version doesn't actually repeal Obamacare in any significant way does this bill have more heart as the president would say Jonathan you know I'm torn this morning on the one hand this is no longer the Obamacare repeal bill that's good on the other hand this is just a giant cut and Medicaid that's what this bill now amounts to huh and that's bad okay and so he's he's upset about the Medicaid cuts but he says that basically Trump care is Obamacare and this is essentially correct there's a poll that just came out from NBC Wall Street Journal they found only 34 percent of Republicans like the House GOP health care bill and only 16% of Americans overall say that that House GOP health care bill is a good idea the Senate GOP health care bill is in many ways even worse Peter Sudirman over komm has a good rundown on what exactly is in the bill what he says is the senate plan looks even closer to the health-care law that is already on the books in other words it is exactly what critics predicted a bill that at least in the near term retains weakened versions of nearly all of Obamacare score features while fixing few if any of the problems Republicans say they want to fix it is Obamacare life the health law Republicans claim to oppose but less of it it represents a total failure of Republican policy imagination and then he goes on he says to understand the Senate plan it helps to recall Obama cares underlying framework the centerpiece of the law was a reform of the individual market intended to give those who do not get coverage through work or a federal program access to subsidized regulated coverage the law created a new federal subsidy based on income for lower and middle-income households to purchase health insurance it also set up federal rules requiring insurers to cover pre-existing conditions and a mandated that all individuals obtain health coverage to pay for it so basically it created what we know as Obamacare created these Obamacare markets and the idea was we're going to force all of the insurers to cover people with pre-existing health conditions how do we pay for that by forcing people who are healthy to buy health insurance that was the basic structure of Obamacare so what does the Republican Senate bill do it keeps in place all the regulations it removes the mandate it removes some of the taxes so it keeps all of the mandates on insurance companies which means that the so-called Obamacare death spiral will be accelerated all these insurance companies are going to be forced to take on people they can't afford and nothing makes up the gap except for more government subsidies those government subsidies of course come from borrowing and Republicans are cutting the taxes so they won't come from taxes the reason Republicans are cutting Medicaid in the future is they're playing an accounting game what they're hoping to do is come across as revenue neutral in fact they're hoping that this quote unquote saves revenue to the federal government even though it really will not in the long run so they can pack pass tax reform that's the goal here if you understand that the Obamacare repeal plan from the Senate is designed to do two things neither of which is repealing Obamacare you'll understand all you need to know about this Obamacare repeal program it is designed to number one tell Republicans that it repealed Obamacare without actually repealing it and number two it is designed to make room for tax cut under reconciliation under reconciliation in order for Republicans to pass a bill through the Senate with 51 votes instead of 60 necessary to shut down a filibuster Republic have to get a score from the Congressional Budget Office that says that any bill that they pass is quote unquote revenue neutral pay tax cuts are not revenue neutral because in the short term at least they reduce the amount of money that comes into the federal government so Republicans are trying to do is pass a health care bill that cuts the amounts of outlay by the federal government so they can then take that amount and translate it into a tax reform bill so all the Republicans really want from Obamacare repeal is the headline that says they repealed it even though they didn't and to the ability to pass a tax cut that's it that's all this is and so the Senate bill accomplishes both those goals but it doesn't actually repeal Obamacare Republicans have criticized these marketplaces as sudirman says for being expensive and unstable Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says Obamacare is collapsing around us yet even more than a house plan the Senate plan retains the essential structure of Obama cares individual market reforms it would likely result in fewer people being covered and it would not stop the destabilization of the market so it doesn't actually help anybody it creates a permanent subsidy you know right now under Obamacare there are subsidies that go up to 400 percent of the poverty line for a family of four so if you are trying to buy health care in the Obama care plan you get some sort of subsidy up to 400% of the poverty that's about a hundred thousand dollars for a family of four starting in 2020 the Senate bill wraps that back to 350 percent of the poverty line about eighty six thousand dollars for the same family well that hurts the middle class people who have been reliance on those subsidies and - we shouldn't be subsidizing this stuff anyway okay the idea that we should be subsidizing a family of four that makes a hundred thousand dollars a year to buy Obama care it doesn't actually help anything in the sense that it continues to drive up costs because healthy people are still not getting insured once you remove the mandate so if you have an unhealthy family of four even with the subsidy they lose money if they're healthy then they shouldn't really need the subsidy should they so it's this bizarre situation it's an entitlement program basically that Republicans are signing off on and then they're proposing to authorize certain payments called CSR payments these are cost-sharing reduction subsidies to insurers so we are now going to subsidize the insurance companies even the same way that Obama was going to remember Obama tried to subsidize the insurers and Republicans sued to stop him and now Republicans are going to backtrack on Republicans are now going to provide the same subsidies they sued Obama for providing under the Senate version so the reports by the way indicate that those subsidies for families before they're pegged to lower-cost plans which means smaller subsidies for crappier health insurance as Sudirman says the scheme undercuts the GOP complaint Obamacare hurts the middle class in addition to higher deductibles it creates a subsidy cliff for middle-class families purchasing health insurance on the individual market and of course it still spends an enormous amount of money so if you look at the Senate bill and how it handles Medicaid it's like the House bill this is the one good parenthood part it slowly rolls back Medicaid expansion over a period of years and converts it into a per capita system rather than a need-based system but it's it delays the start of that phase out until 2021 which means it's never going to happen because a Republican president and Republican Congress would have to be elected from here all the way aural 2020 in order to ensure that this kicks in otherwise the Democrats will come in and they'll just roll it back and says starting in 2025 who places stricter cap on the growth of Medicaid spending than the House bill yeah except by 2025 who thinks that Republicans are going to be able to withhold the pressure all the way to 2025 anybody anybody if you this is the way that the legislation works folks it says in 10 years we're going to do act it's never happening because somebody from the other party will come in and destroy it before the 10 years are up this is all it's just it's a bad bill it's a bad bill Sudirman says this might be the notable failure to think beyond the terms set by Obamacare means the Senate bill not only won't the Obamacare repeal it might not even be Obamacare light instead it might be Obamacare light later and later could easily turn out to be never because as the individual insurance markets fail thanks to the lack of a mandate and thanks to the lack of taxes to pay for any of this stuff then there's going to be more and more call for government involvement not less and less call or more more call for free markets bottom line is the Republicans in the Senate in the house do not want to repeal Obamacare because they have all bought into the basic notion that the government ought to be involved in the health care system which is a disaster for Republicans Democrats won this debate and now Republicans are surrendering to it so the question becomes why the hell do you elect Republicans in the first place I'll get to that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at quip so quick is this brand new too brush company and it is just phenomenal for two reasons one I used to have an electric toothbrush they're heavy it's hard to travel with them whenever I would travel I

features into a very slim design with a battery in it it's basically like a Apple designed a toothbrush but it doesn't have a big price tag on it you have to see it impress with it yourself it's really terrific obviously I brush with it and you can subscribe to receive new brush heads on a dentist recommended three month plan for just five dollars including free shipping so one of the problems with the electric toothbrushes is if you forget to buy the extra head then you're using the same head for the next seven years which is disgusting quick make sure that you get the new head

get that first refill pack free and use the flash capiro so that they know that we sent you and they continue to advertise with us okay so with all of this set the fact that the tenant bill sucks right now we are now learning there at least a couple of Republican senators who are probably not going to vote for it which means that it may not pass at all the question becomes do Republicans even long passed this thing do Republicans you want to pass this thing and it's not clear that they do it's not clear that Republicans actually want to do much of anything because Republicans number one never want to do much of anything because they're afraid that if they do something there will be a backlash and number two because if you run the entire federal government you pass something massive again this could catalyze the left into opposition for example take the Aussie operation Georgia SiC so there were a lot of people who are suggesting that Asaf should have run more strip more heavily on Trump care okay number one that wasn't going to work because that's a pretty Apple district not a lot of people are on obamacare to begin with in that district and number two nothing has actually passed it was hard to run against a piece of legislation that doesn't actually exist yet if Republicans pass a very unpopular piece of legislation which this looks like it is then they will bear the burden of that now imagine for a second the Republicans had come in and just fulfilled the basic promise we're going to repeal Obamacare end of story one sentence Obamacare is repealed but today just come in and done that and then then you go she entered around the edges for what we're going to do to fix the problems that Obamacare was designed to solve then Republicans would be in pretty good shape but now because they're trying this omnibus fix to Obamacare that doesn't actually fix it leaves it in place increases subsidies in certain areas decreases subsidies in certain other areas gets rid of the underlying mechanism for funding the whole damn thing so we're just going to borrow up the wazoo for it and then pretend we're going to cut later if Republicans do that then Democrats will have something to coalesce around which is silly because the fact is that if you're gonna pass policies they ought to be good policies if you're going to take political risk it ought to be for a good potential payoff there is an alternative strategy that Republicans could pursue if they really don't want to do anything there's an alternative strategy that they could pursue that unfortunately I think unfortunately would actually work with the Republican crowd it would also prevent them from sustaining massive losses in 2018 because they wouldn't actually pass anything deeply unpopular but
