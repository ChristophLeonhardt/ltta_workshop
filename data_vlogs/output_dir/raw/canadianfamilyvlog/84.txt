22
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,470
ready to go there's Josh's stuff already

23
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,520

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:33,409
looking good Josh it's got your pants on

25
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,700
yeah you probably don't understand that

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,290
joke but it's funny for us when we watch

27
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,700
this back in 20 years will be laughing

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,850
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Josh did I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just finished our camping</font>

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,460
and now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> heading back and it's so</font>

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,079

31
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">ice-cold I was nice and warm but Josh</font>

32
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,930
was easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I turned into an ice cube</font>

33
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,100
instantly when you camp in a hammock

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,689
it's a little tricky because you have to

35
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:59,640
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right type of insulation to</font>

36
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,560
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> you warm or else you're gonna</font>

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,869
freeze to death because the what the air

38
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,820
is getting from underneath and from the

39
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,860
top so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a tricky Hill I'm honest I'm</font>

40
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,860
not looking at you so yeah Josh didn't
