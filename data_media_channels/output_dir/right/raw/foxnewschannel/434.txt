TALKING TO HIM THIS WEEK AND

8
00:00:25,498 --> 00:00:26,700
WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO HIM.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,101
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE SAID AND

10
00:00:28,101 --> 00:00:29,970
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE MEANT

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,004
AND WHETHER ANYONE ELSE WAS

12
00:00:31,004 --> 00:00:34,674
PRESENT FOR THESE MEETINGS.

13
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:35,508

COMMITTEE.

16
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:38,411
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

17
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:40,046
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

18
00:00:40,046 --> 00:00:43,383
>> WELL, I WANT THE KNOW THE

19
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:43,783
SAME THING.

20
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:45,018
I'VE GIVEN MR. ROSENSTEIN ON

21
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:46,119
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE A LITTLE

22
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:46,419
BREAK.

23
00:00:46,419 --> 00:00:48,321
IT WAS THE TIMES THAT REPORTED

24
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:50,223
IT AND ANDREW MCCABE THAT WAS

25
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:51,391
SUPPOSEDLY WITH HIM.

26
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:53,493
WE NEED TO KNOW HOW SERIOUS

27
00:00:53,493 --> 00:00:55,795
THIS WAS BECAUSE THIS POINTS TO

28
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:57,230
ACTUALLY TAKE OVER THE AMERICAN

29
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,631
GOVERNMENT.

30
00:00:57,631 --> 00:01:00,100
IF HE MEANT IT AND THIS IS

31
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,002
SOMETHING HE WAS POISED TO DO,

32
00:01:02,002 --> 00:01:03,837
THIS IS REALLY PROBLEMATIC.

33
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:05,004
>> Sandra: ROSENSTEIN HAS

34
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:06,373
DENIED IT.

35
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:09,409
>> HE HAS DENIED IT BUT IN WAYS

36
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:11,278
THAT ARE AMBIGUOUS AND HE HAS

37
00:01:11,278 --> 00:01:14,080
SAID WELL, WE WERE JUST JOKING

38
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,414
AROUND.

39
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:15,548
OTHERS PRESENT REPORTEDLY HAVE

40
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:17,417
SAID NO, HE WAS DEAD SERIOUS

41
00:01:17,417 --> 00:01:18,785
AND WHY WE WANT MR. ROSENSTEIN

42
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:20,553
TO COME IN SO WE CAN GET HIM TO

43
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,355
TELL US HIS SIDE OF THE STORY.

44
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:24,925
>> Sandra: WHAT DO YOU THINK

45
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:26,326
WILL COME FROM THE CLOSED-DOOR

46
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:28,061
MEETING?

47
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:29,696
>> I THINK YOU'LL SEE HOPEFULLY

48
00:01:29,696 --> 00:01:31,431
WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT

49
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,867
BUT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE FISA

50
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:36,236
DOCUMENTS AND WHY WE AREN'T

51
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:37,904
GETTING THOSE RELEASED AND WHY

52
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:40,006
THE DOCUMENTS WE'VE BEEN

53
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:41,408
WANTING HAVE BEEN REDACTED SO

54
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:42,676
HEAVILY AND WHY HE HAS

55
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,211
STONEWALLED US ON THAT STUFF.

56
00:01:44,211 --> 00:01:47,247
I THINK THIS WILL BE A LITTLE

57
00:01:47,247 --> 00:01:49,382
MORE BROAD THAN JUST THE

58
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:50,884
ALLEGATIONS THAT HE WAS GOING

59
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:53,687
TO WIRETAP THE PRESIDENT.

60
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:56,256
>> Sandra: MARK MEADOWS, HE

61
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:57,424
TWEETED OUT THE HOUSE

62
00:01:57,424 --> 00:02:00,026
LEADERSHIP HAD AGREED TO CALL

63
00:02:00,026 --> 00:02:01,461
ROSENSTEIN FOR THE CLOSED-DOOR

64
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:02,729
MEETING TO EXPLAIN HIS ALLEGE

65
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:03,964
COMMENTS ON WIRING THE

66
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:04,331
PRESIDENT.

67
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,766
WE'LL SEE IF IT GETS EXPANDED

68
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:06,800
AND WHERE IT GOES.

69
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,435
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAPPEN

70
00:02:08,435 --> 00:02:10,503
WITH ROD ROSENSTEIN?

71
00:02:10,503 --> 00:02:12,839
>> WELL, I THINK HE SHOULD

72
00:02:12,839 --> 00:02:13,173
RESIGN.

73
00:02:13,173 --> 00:02:15,475
I HAVE FELT THAT WAY FOR A

74
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:18,311
NUMBER OF MONTHS NOW BECAUSE

75
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:19,513
EVERYTHING FROM THE FOURTH

76
00:02:19,513 --> 00:02:20,514
RENEWAL OF THE FISA WARRANT

77
00:02:20,514 --> 00:02:26,153
THAT HE SIGNED ALL THE WAY TO

78
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:28,489
HIS LAX SUPERVISION OF THE

79
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:29,423
MUELLER INVESTIGATION.

80
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,958
THE DOCUMENTS THAT HE HASN'T

81
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,229
PROVIDED INDICATES A PATTERN.

82
00:02:35,229 --> 00:02:36,397
THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO TROUBLING

83
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:39,199
BECAUSE IT FITS INTO THE

84
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:40,634
PATTERN OF HIM SUBVERTING

85
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:41,568
PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM THE WAY

86
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:42,970
THE TIME HE WAS A CANDIDATE TO

87
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,371
NOW.

88
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,006
>> Sandra: ONE HOUSE DEMOCRAT

89
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,108
JERRY NADLER OF NEW YORK SAYS

90
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:48,942
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES CAN'T BE

91
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:50,911
LEFT ALONE IN THE ROOM WITH

92
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:51,312
ROSENSTEIN.

93
00:02:51,312 --> 00:02:52,413
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY, I

94
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,514
SUPPOSE, ALSO HE DOESN'T SHOW

95
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:55,115
UP FOR THIS.

96
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:56,984
IF HE DOES, THOUGH, JERRY

97
00:02:56,984 --> 00:02:59,086
NADLER SAID THEY WILL NOT

98
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:00,788
REFERENCING REPUBLICANS, THEY

99
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:02,923
WILL NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR

100
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:03,724
ATTEMPT TO UNDERMINE MUELLER'S

101
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:04,391
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETE.

102
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:07,127
WHAT DO YOU SAY BACK TO

103
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,263
DEMOCRATS WHO SAY IT IS AN

104
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:09,964
EFFORT TO UNDERMINE THE

105
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:10,664
INVESTIGATION.

106
00:03:10,664 --> 00:03:12,967
>> IT IS NOT AN EFFORT TO

107
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:13,667
UNDERMINE THE INVESTIGATION.

108
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:15,336
WE ARE TRYING TO GET AT THE

109
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:16,270
TRUTH.

110
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,438
MAKE IT TRANSPARENT.

111
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:18,372
WHAT WE'VE FOUND OUT EVERYTHING

112
00:03:18,372 --> 00:03:20,708
THAT HAS COME OUT OF THESE

113
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,408
INVESTIGATIONS IT WAS THE

114
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:22,176
DEMOCRATS, HILLARY CLINTON THAT

115
00:03:22,176 --> 00:03:24,311
WERE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE

116
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,113
RUSSIANS TO DEFEAT A POLITICAL

117
00:03:26,113 --> 00:03:28,182
OPPONENT WHICH IS OUTRAGEOUS.

118
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:29,450
THEY NEED TO CONFESS UP TO THAT

119
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,185
AND LET US GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

120
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:31,485
THIS.

121
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:34,722
WE WON'T GET TO THE BOTTOM OF

122
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:40,628
IT WITH THE D.O.J. AND F.B.I.

123
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:41,462
OBFUSCATING AT THE HIGHEST

124
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:41,796
LEVELS.

125
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,431
>> Sandra: DO YOU THINK HE

126
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,498
SHOWS UP FOR THIS MEETING?

127
00:03:44,498 --> 00:03:46,234
>> I THINK SO.

128
00:03:46,234 --> 00:03:47,401
HE HAS COME PUBLICLY AND

129
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,836
TESTIFIED BEFORE US AND HE WILL

130
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:49,971
PROBABLY COME AGAIN.

131
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:51,873
>> Sandra: IF HE DOESN'T DO YOU

132
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:53,741
AGREE WITH ISSUING A SUBPOENA

133
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,142
AS MEADOWS SUGGESTED?

134
00:03:55,142 --> 00:00:00,000
>> I SHOULD SAY WE SHOULD ISSUE
