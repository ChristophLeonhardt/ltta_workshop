00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">also gives you an idea of the television</font>

although all these actors are fantastic

112
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,049
but for their women and for the

113
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,819
directors and for the writing and the

114
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:20,620
dialogue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plot throwing you a</font>

115
