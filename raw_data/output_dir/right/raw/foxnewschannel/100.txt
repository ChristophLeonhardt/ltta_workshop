1
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:09,669
>> Shannon: IF YOU ARE JUST

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,004
JOINING US TONIGHT, SAUDI ARABIA

3
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:14,440
NOW ADMITS KHASHOGGI IS DEAD,

4
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:16,909
SAYING HE WAS KILLED DURING A

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,246
FIST FIGHT AT THE SAUDI

6
00:00:20,247 --> 00:00:28,955
CONSULATE IN ISTANBUL.

7
00:00:28,956 --> 00:00:30,590
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US

8
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:31,257
TONIGHT.

9
00:00:31,258 --> 00:00:35,428
WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT OTHER

10
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:36,162
LAWMAKER'S REACTION.

11
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:37,063
WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?

12
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:40,032
>> IT JUST RAISES MORE

13
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:40,399
QUESTIONS.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,335
FOR INSTANCE, I CAN'T BELIEVE A

15
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:43,870
15-MAN INTELLIGENCE TEAM THOUGHT

16
00:00:43,871 --> 00:00:45,571
THEY COULDN'T BRING DOWN

17
00:00:45,572 --> 00:00:46,973
KHASHOGGI WITHOUT ANY BODILY

18
00:00:46,974 --> 00:00:47,473
INJURY AT ALL.

19
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:48,307
THEY'RE EXPERTS.

20
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:50,309
THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,011
EVEN IF THERE WERE A FIGHT,

22
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:53,412
WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE, THEY

23
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,414
WOULD BE ABLE TO BRING HIM DOWN.

24
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:58,351
THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM OR

25
00:00:58,352 --> 00:01:00,153
CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY.

26
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:01,854
PEOPLE OF THAT PHYSICAL STATURE

27
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:02,922
AND TRAINING COULD HAVE BROUGHT

28
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:03,356
HIM DOWN.

29
00:01:03,357 --> 00:01:05,391
THEN THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHAT

30
00:01:05,391 --> 00:01:06,726
WERE THEIR ORDERS WHEN THEY WENT

31
00:01:06,727 --> 00:01:07,026
THERE.

32
00:01:07,027 --> 00:01:10,429
IT'S ONE THING TO SAY THAT YOU

33
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,865
MISUNDERSTAND AN ORDER, BUT TO

34
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,734
MISUNDERSTAND THE EXTENT OF

35
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:16,135
TAKING SOMEBODY BACK FOR

36
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,136
INTERROGATION AND KILLING THEM

37
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:18,971
IS A BIG DIFFERENCE.

38
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:20,306
AND ALSO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE

39
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:20,773
BODY?

40
00:01:20,774 --> 00:01:22,675
IS IT TRUE THAT IT WAS CARVED UP

41
00:01:22,676 --> 00:01:29,949
AND TORN APART AND WAS IT BURIED

42
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,483
SOMEWHERE?

43
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:34,020
THERE'S TOO MANY UNANSWERS

44
00:01:34,021 --> 00:01:34,387
QUESTIONS.

45
00:01:34,388 --> 00:01:36,589
BUT STILL, THERE HAS TO BE A LOT

46
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,025
MORE TO THIS STORY AND HOW CLOSE

47
00:01:39,026 --> 00:01:42,061
DOES IT GET TO THE CROWN PRINCE?

48
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:46,132
>> Shannon: ABSOLUTELY, KEY

49
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:46,499
QUESTION.

50
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,134
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT KHASHOGGI

51
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:50,670
WAS KILLED BY BRAWLING WITH A

52
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:53,372
TEAM IS NOT CREDIBLE.

53
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:55,641
THE KINGDOM AND ALL INVOLVED

54
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:58,177
MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

55
00:01:58,178 --> 00:02:00,213
IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL

56
00:02:00,214 --> 00:02:02,448
NOT TAKE THE LEAD, CONGRESS

57
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:02,748
MUST.

58
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,717
WHAT CAN YOU DO, WHAT WILL YOU

59
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,586
DO IF YOU DON'T THINK THE WHITE

60
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:10,256
HOUSE HAS BEEN TOUGH ENOUGH?

61
00:02:10,257 --> 00:02:12,191
>> CONGRESS CAN IMPOSE

62
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,493
SANCTIONS, WE CAN TIE UP MONEY.

63
00:02:14,494 --> 00:02:15,862
BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

64
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:17,296
PRESIDENT IS PROBABLY TRYING TO

65
00:02:17,297 --> 00:02:17,630
DO.

66
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:19,232
IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO ALL WE CAN

67
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:25,972
TO KEEP THE SAUDIS AS AN ALLEY

68
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:28,975
-- ALLY, EVEN IF WE DON'T FULLY

69
00:02:28,976 --> 00:02:29,442
TRUST THEM.

70
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:38,951
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO PUNISH

71
00:02:38,952 --> 00:02:39,385
THEM.

72
00:02:39,386 --> 00:02:41,854
AGAIN, IT'S A BALANCING ACT THE

73
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:42,555
PRESIDENT'S IN.

74
00:02:42,556 --> 00:02:44,290
OTHER PRESIDENTS HAVE BEEN THERE

75
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,892
AND THEY'VE HAD TO DO THE SAME

76
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:46,192
THING.

77
00:02:46,193 --> 00:02:49,128
IT'S A LITTLE TOUGHER FOR

78
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:49,896
PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE THIS ONE

79
00:02:49,897 --> 00:02:52,865
IS SO MUCH OUT IN THE OPEN.

80
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:55,534
YOU HAVE AN AMERICAN RESIDENT

81
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,536
AND A JOURNALIST BEING KILLED IN

82
00:02:57,537 --> 00:03:00,072
A SAUDI CONSULATE, WHICH IS

83
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:02,041
SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE GROUNDS FOR

84
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,243
EVERYONE, AND THEN UNDER SERIOUS

85
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:04,677
CIRCUMSTANCES.

86
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:05,578
THIS IS TOUGHER FOR THE

87
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:11,617
PRESIDENT THAN OTHER PRESIDENTS.

88
00:03:11,618 --> 00:03:14,020
SO, LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND WHAT

89
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,254
THE PRESIDENT IS TRYING TO DO,

90
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,657
BUT HE HAS TO MAKE IT CLEAR

91
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:19,225
WE'RE GOING TO STAND BY OUR

92
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:20,293
VALUES.

93
00:03:20,294 --> 00:03:22,595
YES, IT'S A FIRST STEP, BUT

94
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:25,765
THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO.

95
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:26,499
>> Shannon: ALL THROUGH THE LAST

96
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,534
WEEK OR SO, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

97
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:30,970
SAYING, LISTEN, THE PRESIDENT IS

98
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:35,074
BUYING HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER

99
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:36,575
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

100
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,677
HERE'S WHAT WAS SAID WHEN I

101
00:03:37,678 --> 00:03:38,878
ASKED ABOUT THIS.

102
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,846
>> THIS IS THE MOST

103
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,415
DISRESPECTFUL THING I'VE EVER

104
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,616
SEEN TOWARD THE PRESIDENT OF

105
00:03:43,617 --> 00:03:44,083
UNITED STATES.

106
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,718
HE HAS DONE EVERYTHING HE COULD

107
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,386
TO HELP SAUDI ARABIA AND THIS IS

108
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:49,355
THE WAY YOU REPAY.

109
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:50,656
HE'S A STRONG MAN, PRESIDENT

110
00:03:50,657 --> 00:03:51,190
TRUMP.

111
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,926
THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED.

112
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:57,229
>> Shannon: DO YOU SEE THIS AS

113
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,297
DISRESPECTFUL TO THE U.S.?

114
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:00,433
>> IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

115
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:02,935
THE FACT IS WHAT THEY'VE DONE

116
00:04:02,936 --> 00:04:04,603
HERE IS IT'S SHOWN THEY'RE STILL

117
00:04:04,604 --> 00:04:06,105
BACK IN THE 19TH CENTURY

118
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:06,973
SOMEWHERE, THINKING THEY CAN

119
00:04:06,974 --> 00:04:08,574
CARRY OUT THIS TYPE OF MURDER IN

120
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:10,476
THE CONSULATE WITH THE WHOLE

121
00:04:10,477 --> 00:04:11,210
WORLD KNOWING WHAT IT IS AND

122
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:12,311
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

123
00:04:12,312 --> 00:04:14,313
SO, YEAH, IT'S DUMB ON THEIR

124
00:04:14,314 --> 00:04:15,181
PART.

125
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,316
IT SHOWS A CERTAIN SAVAGERY.

126
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,952
BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

127
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,053
IF WE CAN WITHOUT SACRIFICING

128
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:24,957
OUR PRINCIPLES, SOMEHOW KEEP THE

129
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,258
SAUDIS DOING THE RIGHT THING AS

130
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:28,260
FAR AS INTELLIGENCE, IRAN,

131
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:31,063
RUSSIA, BUT AGAIN, WE CAN'T GIVE

132
00:04:31,064 --> 00:04:32,898
THEM EVERYTHING AND WE HAVE TO

133
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,000
MAKE IT CLEAR THEY HAVE TO BE

134
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,034
PUNISHED FOR WHAT THEY DID.

135
00:04:35,035 --> 00:04:36,102
IT'S A LINE TO WALK.

136
00:04:36,103 --> 00:00:00,000
WE HAVE TO DO IT.
