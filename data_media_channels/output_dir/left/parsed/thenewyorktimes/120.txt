There’s nothing like
the physics of fruit.
Specifically, citrus fruit.
What you’re seeing is
the skin of a fruit being
squeezed by pliers
to produce dozens
of ultra-fast microjets.
The tiny streams
rocketing out of the skin
have been slowed
down 266 times.
In real time, these jets
travel 30 feet per second —
about the speed of
a Champagne cork.
Other plants also
produce microjets.
This squirting cucumber
does it to spread its seeds.
In the animal kingdom
a similar process
is used for swift
attacks, like that
of the ferocious
spitting cobra.
Scientists who study the
mechanism of citrus jets
found that sacs of oil
lie on the soft layer
beneath a more rigid skin.
As the fruit is
squeezed, the skin
hits a sudden failure point.
The skin breaks, and the
fluid erupts under pressure.
Here’s a ruptured
sac afterward.
Scientists don’t know
why citrus fruits have
this ability, but they’re
keen to harness its power.
It could help with commercial
printing, medicine delivery,
and even bridge safety.
Imagine a sensor that
changes color or gives off
a signal when a bridge
has hit its maximum load.
But for now, it’s a
reminder that some
of the most mundane
aspects of daily life
can hold beautiful secrets.
