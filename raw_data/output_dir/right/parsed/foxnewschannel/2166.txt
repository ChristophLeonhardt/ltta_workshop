AINSLEY: THE BOY SCOUTS OF
AMERICA MAKING A MAJOR
CHANGE DROPPING BOY FROM
THEIR TITLE.
OPTING FOR A MORE JUSTICE
CENTER NEUTRAL NAME SCOUTS
BSA AND THAT STARTS NEXT
YEAR, BRIAN.
BRIAN: SOUNDS LIKE A JOKE,
DOESN'T IT?
OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS HE WON'T
LET HIS SONS ANYWHERE NEAR
THE ORGANIZATION NOW AND
INSTEAD USE THIS TO TEACH
THEM A LESSON ABOUT TRUTH
AND REASON AND LOGIC.
MATT WALSH IS WITH THE DAILY
WIRE.COM AND AUTHOR OF THIS
BOOK "THE UNHOLY TRINITY"
BLOCKING THE LEFT'S ASSAULT
ON LIFE, MARRIAGE AND
GENDER.
SOME SAY HEY, WHAT'S THE BIG
DEAL?
MATT, I THINK THIS IS A BIG
DEAL BECAUSE THERE IS THIS
THING CALLED THE GIRL SCOUTS
THAT ARE GOING TO SUFFER
FROM THAT AND I THINK THERE
IS A REASON WHY THE
CURRICULUM IS DIFFERENT.
DO YOU?
>> YEAH.
BECAUSE THIS IS A CURRICULUM
FOR BOYS AND BOYS ARE
DIFFERENT THAN GIRLS.
I KNOW THIS IS A TRUTH THAT
UPSETS PEOPLE THESE DAYS
BECAUSE EYE OBVIOUS TRUTH
DOES.
BOYS ARE DIFFERENT THAN
GIRLS.
CONCERNED ABOUT THE MORAL
FORMATION OF BOYS AND MAKING
BOYS INTO MEN.
WELL THEN YOU NEED TO
SEPARATE THEM FROM GIRLS AND
GIVE THEM A DIFFERENT SORT
OF EXPERIENCE AND SO IT IS A
BIG DEAL.
HAVE YOU THIS ICONIC
AMERICAN ORGANIZATION WHICH
IS NOW DESTROYED ITSELF
BENDING TO THE WHIMS OF THE
P.C. LIFTEDDIST MOB AND THIS
IS A LESSON FOR EVERYONE.
I WILL USE THIS AS A LESSON
FOR MY SONS TO SHOW THEM,
YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE
STANDING ON TRUTH AND
STANDING ON A FIRM GROUND OF
MORAL TRUTH, AND YOU START
GIVING UP INCHES AND START
SURRENDERING, THEN BEFORE
LONG THERE IS NOTHING LEFT.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH
THE BOY SCOUTS AT THIS
POINT.
AINSLEY: OUR PRODUCERS WERE
TELLING US DURING THE
COMMERCIAL BREAK WRITING IN
THIS IS THE END TROUGH
ADDITION.
MOST OF OUR VIEWERS ARE
FURIOUS ABOUT THIS SAYING
MEN NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BE
MEN IN ORDER TO LEARN HOW TO
TREAT A WOMAN CORRECTLY.
YOU SAY YOU ARE KEEPING YOUR
SONS AWAY FROM IT NOW?
WHY IS THAT?
>> COMPLETELY SACRIFICED
THEIR IDENTITY.
I DON'T WANT MY SON -- THIS
IS A WRONG EXAMPLE.
I DON'T WANT MY SON TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH AN
ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD GIVE
UP ITS IDENTITY AND ITS
MISSION WHICH WAS A GOOD,
POSITIVE MISSION JUST
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE UPSET.
THAT'S THE WRONG MESSAGE.
I WANT MY SONS TO KNOW
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
AINSLEY: I CAN UNDERSTAND IF
WE DIDN'T HAVE A GIRL SCOUT.
IF YOU ARE A GIRL AND WANT
TO BE PART OF THE SCOUTS,
THEN YOU JOIN THE GIRL
SCOUTS.
IF YOU ARE A BOY, YOU JOIN
THE BOY SCOUTS.
THERE IS ONE FOR EACH.
>> EXACTLY.
ALWAYS SEEMS TO KIND OF GO
THIS WAY WHERE WE TAKE AWAY
ALL THE SPACES THAT ARE FOR
BOYS AND WE STILL LET GIRLS
HAVE SPACES.
SO IT'S LIKE IN REC LEAGUES
WHILE THE GIRLS CAN PLAY
WITH THE BOYS THEY ALSO HAVE
SOFTBALL TEAM.
BOYS CAN'T PLAY ON THE
SOFTBALL TEAM.
GIRLS CAN HAVE THEIR SPACE
AND BOYS CAN'T HAVE THEIRS.
WE ARE DEPRIVING SOMETHING,
TAKING AWAY FROM BOYS THEY
DON'T NEED.
BRIAN: LOT OF MILITARY COMES
FROM SCOUTING.
THEY HAVE THAT BACKGROUND
AND LEARN SOME VALUABLE
LESSONS THERE AT LOVE PEOPLE
DON'T LIKE SPORTS BUT WANT
TO BE INVOLVED IN
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES
AND TIME TO BOND AND FORM
THAT TEAM.
DO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE
ENROLLMENT IS DOWN FROM BOY
SCOUTS GOING TO TRY TO SUCK
THEM FROM THE GIRL SCOUTS?
>> I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY
PART OF IT.
WHY IS ENROLLMENT DOWN?
ENROLLMENT IS DOWN BECAUSE
THEY STARTING GIVING UP WHO
THEY'RE.
THEY STARTED GETTING AWAY
FROM FUNDAMENTAL MISSION
WHICH ORIGINALLY WAS THIS
WAS FOR BOYS.
IT IS A CHRISTIAN
ORGANIZATION.
THE MORE THEY GET AWAY FROM
