WILL
THE SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREAN
LEADER KIM JONG UN AND TRUMP
STILL HAPPEN?
LAST WEEK TRUMP
HAD RELEASED A LETTER TO KIM
JONG-UN AND INDICATING THAT THE
SUMMIT WAS CANCELED FOLLOWING
SOME OF THE MORE SALTIER
RESPONSES THE US HAD RECEIVED
FROM NORTH KOREA.
NOW IT TURNS
OUT THAT MEMBERS OF TRANSIT
MINISTRATION AND TRUMP HIMSELF
ARE MAKING IT SEEM AS THOUGH THE
WHEELS ARE IN MOTION IN TERMS
OF MAKING THIS SUMMIT HAPPEN.
FIRST, LET'S HEAR FROM TRUMP
LAST FRIDAY WHEN HE SAID MAYBE
THE SUMMIT CAN STILL HAPPEN.
TAKE A LOOK.
WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
WE ARE TALKING TO THEM NOW, THEY
VERY MUCH WANTED TO DO IT, WE
LIKE TO DO IT, WE WILL SEE
WHAT HAPPENS.
JOHN, EVERYBODY PLAYS GAMES.
YOU KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW THAT BETTER THAN
ANYBODY.
EVERYBODY PLAYS GAMES, OKAY.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT WHAT
IS CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IS
JUST PART OF THE GAME PLAYING,
BUT WILL BE DO KNOW IS THAT KIM
YOUNG CHOL WHO WAS A NORTH
KOREAN OFFICIAL AND KIM JONG
UN'S RIGHT-HAND MAN IS
TRAVELING TO THE UNITED STATES
TO MEET WIT MIKE POMPEO, THAT IS
THE SECRETARY OF STATE.
SINCE HE
IS ON HIS WAY TO NEW YORK IT
APPEARS HE HAS BEEN GRANTED
THAT WAIVER.
THERE ARE OTHER MOVING
PARTS TO 
THE STORY.
I'VE GOT TWISTS AND TURNS
TO THE STORY.
I LIKE WHAT TRUMP IS DOING.
WOAH, THAT IS A TWIST
RIGHT THERE.
I'M GLAD THEY
TALKED ABOUT THE NONSENSE NOBEL
PEACE PRIZE, THAT IS ANOTHER
TERM SO I WILL EXPLAIN ALL THAT
BUT FIRST I WANT YOU TO KNOW
ABOUT OUR FRIEND GEN.
KIM YOUNG
CHOL, HE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE
MASTERMINDED THE SINKING OF A
SOUTH KOREAN NAVY SHIP BACK IN
2010 THAT KILLED 46 SAILORS
WHILE SERVING AS THE TOP
INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL.
NOT A GOOD GUY.
BUT YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE WITH
YOUR FRIENDS, YOU NEGOTIATE
WITH YOUR ENEMIES.
I THINK THEY SHOULD'VE GRANTED
HIM A WAIVER, THERE IS SOME
DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER HE WILL BE
A FIXER AND THE NEGOTIATIONS
HAVE A ROADBLOCK TO THE
DENUCLEARIZATION THAT OR THEY
ARE ALMOST ALWAYS COMING IN TO
ANOINT THE TALKS AND SAY YES
THIS WILL BE THE DEAL BEFORE
THE TWO PRESIDENTS MEET.
IN THAT CASE I AM REFERRING TO
KIM JONG-UN.
WHY DO I SUPPORT
DONALD TRUMP?
JOHN BOHN AND MIKE PENCE WALKED
US TO THE EDGE OF DESTROYING
THESE PEACE TALKS.
AND I'M GLAD THE 18 HOUSE
REPUBLICANS WHO IN MY OPINION
ARE CRAZY ñ THAT CREATED SOME
SORT OF INCENTIVE FOR TRUMP AND
HIS EGO TO STAY ENGAGED WITH
THE PEACE TALKS.
IF HE COULD DOCK THE SHIP AND
DENUCLEARIZE NORTH KOREA AND
THEY ACTUALLY FALL THROUGH.
IF THEY DO THAT ALL THE CREDIT
IN THE WORLD TO DONALD TRUMP.
I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT IN TERMS
OF GIVING TRUMP THE CARROT.
EVEN MAINSTREAM MEDIA OUTLETS
THAT TYPICALLY ARE INCREDIBLY
CRITICAL OF TRUMP WERE
APPLAUDING HIS ATTEMPTS TO
NEGOTIATE.
I THINK TRUMP MORE THAN ANYONE
LOVES THAT KIND OF
COMPLEMENTARY COVERAGE
IN THE NEWS.
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE THE
NEW YORK TIMES.
WHETHER IT IS THE DAILY OR THE
WAY THEY WROTE THEIR ARTICLES,
IT ALL SEEMED VERY CELEBRATORY
IN REGARD TO HOW TRUMP HAS
HANDLED IT SO FAR AND THEN WHEN
HE SENT OUT THAT LETTER LAST
THURSDAY HE STARTED GETTING
SOME CRITICISM AGAIN.
NORTH KOREA WANTS SOME PRETTY
SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS IN ORDER
TO DENUCLEARIZE A COUPLE OF
YEARS AGO THERE WAS A GROUP OF
NORTH KOREAN RESTAURANT WORKERS
IN CHINA WHO EFFECTIVELY
DEFECTED AND WENT TO SOUTH
KOREA.
THEY ARE SAYING THEY WANT
THOSE WAITRESSES BACK.
I HIGHLY DOUBT SOUTH KOREA IS
GOING TO BE LIKE HERE YOU GO,
BUT WE WILL SEE.
THIS IS PART OF THE NEGOTIATION.
I
FEEL TERRIBLE FOR THOSE PEOPLE.
NORTH KOREA IS CLAIMING THE
SOUTH KOREANS KIDNAPPED THEM.
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT THEORY.
KIM YOUNG CHOL, ONE OF HIS JOBS
WAS TO SPREAD PROPAGANDA TO
SOUTH KOREA CONVINCE THEM TO
COME OVER TO NORTH KOREA.
PROBABLY ONE OF THE LEAST
EFFECTIVE PROPAGANDA PROGRAMS IN
WORLD HISTORY.
CAN YOU IMAGINE SOUTH KOREANS
SAYING IT IS REALLY GREAT IN
NORTH KOREA?
BUT WE HAVE SEEN PEOPLE GET
TRICKED INTO A LOT OF CRAZY
THINGS INCLUDING HERE IN THE US.
SO OVERALL I HOPE THEY DON'T
GIVE THOSE PEOPLE BACK, THAT
WOULD BE TERRIBLE.
THEY ESCAPE FROM THAT HORRIBLE
SITUATION IN NORTH KOREA.
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH ANNA.
NOTHING IS DONE UNTIL IT
IS DONE.
ESPECIALLY WITH DONALD TRUMP.
ANYTHING CAN GO WRONG AT ANY
MOMENT AND ALSO ESPECIALLY WITH
KIM JONG-UN.
THESE ARE PROBABLY
THE TWO MOST VOLATILE FOREIGN
LEADERS ñ NATIONAL LEADERS
THERE ARE IN THE WORLD.
DON'T COUNT YOUR CHICKENS BEFORE
THEY HATCH BUT IF THEY DO,
GREAT.
I AM IN THE CAMP OF IF TRUMP OR
ANYONE I OPPOSED IS DOING
SOMETHING POSITIVE, WONDERFUL.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO OPPOSE THEM
FOR THE SAKE OF OPPOSING THEM.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE
WHAT THEY HAVE.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE IRRATIONAL
LIKE THAT.
THERE IS PLENTY OF GREAT REASONS
TO OPPOSE DONALD TRUMP BUT IF HE
DOES SOMETHING POSITIVE,
AWESOME.
ABSOLUTELY.
ONE FINAL POINT, WE ARE DEALING
WITH VOLATILE LEADERS BUT MORE
PORTLY WE ARE DEALING WITH
PEOPLE WHO HAVE INCREDIBLY
THIN-SKINNED.
AND DONALD TRUMP REALLY STANDS
OUT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT
CHARACTERISTIC.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS
POSSIBLE, BUT I FEEL LIKE IF
THERE IS EVEN A SMALL THING LOST
IN TRANSLATION OR IF KIM JONG-IL
AND IS SOMETHING SLIGHTLY
CRITICAL OF TRUMP THINGS CAN
CHANGE RAPIDLY.
HE NEEDS TO KEEP HIS COOL AND HE
NEEDS TO CONTINUE GETTING
FAVORABLE NEWS COVERAGE IN
REGARD TO TREATING THE SITUATION
LIKE A DIPLOMATIC PRESIDENT.
YES.
I HOPE IT GOES THAT WAY AND I
HOPE THE TALKS DON'T UNRAVEL.
