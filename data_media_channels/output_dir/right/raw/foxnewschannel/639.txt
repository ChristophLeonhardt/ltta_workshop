THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF THE

200
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:28,806

TO THE ISSUE OF RELIGIOUS

252
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:03,634
FREEDOM.

253
00:07:03,635 --> 00:07:05,236
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK YOU CAN

254
00:07:05,237 --> 00:07:07,605
CUT ACROSS THOSE BIASES AND

255
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:08,973
OTHER THEOCRATIC AREAS AROUND

256
00:07:08,974 --> 00:07:10,241
THE WORLD WHERE THIS IS A REAL

257
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:10,608

GATHERING IS SO IMPORTANT.

263
00:07:19,985 --> 00:07:21,185
EACH OF THESE COUNTRIES TO

264
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:22,420
BECOME AS RELIGIOUSLY TOLERANT

265
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,955
AS THE UNITED STATES IS.

266
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:25,156
BUT WE HAVE SEEN THIS, EVERY

THEIR COUNTRY BETTER, WE THINK
