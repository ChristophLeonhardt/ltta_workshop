SEE. 
THE WAY THAT THIS COUNTRY IS 
DIVIDED CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW. 
THIS WILL BE A MICRO-- THIS 
WILL BE A MICRO-- WHAT'S THAT 
WORD? 
>> MICROCOSM? 
>> EXACTLY. 
IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING BUT 
IT WILL BE THAT. 
>> IT'S VERY TRUE. 
NOT ONLY ARE WE WATCHING SORT 
OF THIS PROCESS AND I THINK 
ALMOST UGLIEST FORM PLAY OUT 
BUT WE CANNOT IGNORE THE FACT 
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING WITH THE 
BACKDROP OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT 
AND BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR A 
WHILE KNEW. 
HI EVERYONE, I'M -- NOW. 
HI EVERYONE, I'M ANNE-MARIE 
GREENE. 
>> AND I'M VLADIMIR DUTHIERS. 
A MICROCOSM OF JOURNALISM HERE, 
I'M GOING TO USE THE WORD NOW 
IN SO MANY INSTANCES. 
SO WE ARE JUST AN HOUR AWAY 
FROM THAT UNPRIEST DEFERENTED 
HIGH STAKES -- UNPRECEDENTED 
HIGH STAKES HEARING ON CAPITOL 
HILL WHERE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WILL SOON 
TESTIFY. 
THEY'LL BOTH FACE QUESTIONS 
FROM THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE ON THE ALLEGED 
DECADES OLD INSTENT. 
>> TODAY'S HEARING COMES AS NEW 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS 
SURFACE AGAINST KAVANAUGH. 
CBS NEWS CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL 
CORRESPONDENT NANCY CORDES HAS 
MORE. 
>> Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP 
SAID HE IS STICKING BY JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH BUT COULD BE 
SWAYED BY BLASEY FORD. 
>> SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU ARE 
SAYING IS THERE IS A SITUATION, 
THERE IS A SCENARIO UNDER WHICH 
YOU WOULD WITHDRAW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION. 
>> IF I THOUGHT HE WAS GUILTY 
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS. 
YEAH SURE. 
I HAVE TO HEAR IT. 
I CAN ALWAYS BE CONVINCE. 
>> Reporter: AT THE SAME TIME 
HE BLAMED THE ALLEGATIONS ON 
DEMOCRATS. 
>> ACTUALLY CON CARTISTS, THEY 
KNOW -- ARTISTS, THEY KNOW HOW 
QUALITY THIS MAN IS AND THEY 
WANT TO DESTROY HIS REPUTATION 
EVEN MORE. 
>> Reporter: ON CAPITOL HILL. 
TEMPERS ARE PARTICULARRING AS 
REPUBLICANS A-- FLARING AS 
REPUBLICANS ASSESS THE DAMAGE 
FROM THE LATEST ACCUSATIONS. 
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION? 
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD -- 
>> WE'RE LATE GUYS. 
>> OKAY. 
LISTEN. 
LET'S KNOCK IT OFF FOR A 
MINUTE. 
>> Reporter: 55-YEAR-OLD JULIE 
SWETNICK CLAIMS THAT AT HIGH 
SCHOOL PARTIES SHE WITNESSED 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND OTHERS 
CAUSE GIRLS TO BECOME 
INEBRIATED AND DISORIENTED TO 
THEN BE GANG RAPED IN A SIDE 
ROOM. 
SWETNICK'S LAWYER IS MICHAEL 
AVENATTI. 
>> THE IDEA THAT ALL THE WOMEN 
GOT TOGETHER AND ABSURD. 
>> Reporter: KAVANAUGH 
FORCEFULLY DENIED THE CLAIMS IN 
A TRANSCRIBED PHONE INTERVIEW 
WITH INVESTIGATORS. 
CALLING THE CLAIMS RIDICULOUS 
AND A TOTAL TWILIGHT ZONE, AND 
ADDING I HAVE NEVER 
PARTICIPATED IN A GANG RAPE. 
DEMOCRATS WERE SKEPTICAL. 
>> WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS REALLY 
APATTERN OF VILE, PREDATORY 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 
>> Reporter: ON THE EVE OF 
TODAY'S HEARING, LAWYERS FOR 
PROFESSOR CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 
RELEASED RESULTS AND PHOTOS 
FROM A POLYGRAPH TEST SHE TOOK 
IN AUGUST. 
ACCORDING TO HER PREPARED 
REMARKS, FORD WILL TELL THE 
COMMITTEE, I WAS PUSHED FROM 
BEHIND INTO A BEDROOM AT A HIGH 
SCHOOL PARTY. 
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME AND PUT 
HIS HAND OVER MY MOUTH TO STOP 
ME FROM SCREAMING, THIS 
TERRIFIED MOE THE MOST. 
IN HIS -- ME THE MOST. 
IN HIS PREPARED REMARKS, HE 
SAYS I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED ANYONE. 
NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT IN 
COLLEGE. 
NOT EVER. 
>> THIS IS GETTING INTO THE 
TWILIGHT ZONE. 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BEING A SERIAL RAPIST 
DURING HIGH SCHOOL. 
>> Reporter: MANY COMMITTEE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE OPENLY 
EXPRESSED DOUBTS ABOUT THE 
ACCUSERS. 
ARIZONA REPUBLICAN JEFF FLAKE 
URGED BOTH SIDES TO KEEP AN 
OPEN MIND. 
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS SOME KIND OF 
SERIAL SEXUAL PREDATOR. 
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT DR. 
FORD IS PART OF SOME VAST 
CONSPIRACY. 
>> Reporter: ALL RIGHT -- 
ACTUALLY BEFORE WE GO FOR MORE 
ON THIS WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING 
RIGHT NOW ARE PROTESTORS IN 
WASHINGTON, D.C.. 
THEY'RE MAKING THEIR WAY 
TOWARDS THE CAPITOL. 
VLAD YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TWO 
DAYS OF THE HEARING FOR BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, THERE WERE 
PROTESTORS ACTUALLY IN THE 
ROOM. 
REALLY DISTURBING. 
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE SOMEBODY 
HAD TO YELL OUT AND HAVE TO BE 
REMOVED FROM THE ROOM. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS TIME 
AROUND THE PROTESTORS ARE 
ACTUALLY BEGINNING TO GET IN 
THE ROOM. 
>> IF THEY DO IT WOULD BE 
DETRIMENTAL TO WHAT'S HAPPENING 
HERE BECAUSE IT WOULD DISTRACT 
FROM THE REAL SERIOUS 
ALLEGATIONS THAT CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD HAS MADE. 
AND IT WILL DETRACT FROM BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S PROTESTATIONS HE 
DIDN'T DO THEM. 
ALSO JUST SORT OF DIMINISH WHAT 
WE'RE WITNESSING. 
SO I REALLY DO HOPE AND THIS IS 
JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION,I 
HOPE THEY DON'T DISTURB THE 
PROCEEDINGS. 
IT'S GREAT TO PROTEST OUT HERE 
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU FEEL 
INCLINED TO DO BUT IN THE 
PROCEEDINGS, I THINK BECAUSE 
SHE'S ALREADY NOT USED TO THIS, 
AND SHE'S PUT IN HER OPENING 
TESTIMONY THAT SHE'S AFRAID TO 
BE HERE, HAVING THESE 
DISRUPTIONS I THINK WOULD BE 
JUST NOT A GOOD THING. 
>> I THINK THIS IS A GOOD RE 
MINDER OF IS THAT WHILE THE 
SENATORS WILL BE LISTENING TO 
THE TESTIMONY, AND PRESUMABLY 
MAKING A DECISION ON HOW 
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE, THE REST 
OF THE COUNTRY IS WATCHING AS 
WELL. 
AND YEAH, THEY'RE NOT CHOOSING 
THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
BUT YOU KNOW IN A COUPLE OF 
MONTHS THEY'LL BE HEADING TO 
THE POLLS TO CHOOSE WHO THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVE IS AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO BE WATCHING HOW THE 
REPUBLICANS PERFORM HERE. 
SO JOINING US NOW IS REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST AND CBS NEWS 
CONTRIBUTOR LESLIE SANCHEZ TO 
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WE 
CAN EXPECT TODAY. 
AND TO THAT, HE HAS SEE, THE 
REPUBLICAN -- LESLIE, THE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE BROUGHT IN 
RACHEL MITCHELL. 
SHE IS A SEASONED SEX CRIMES 
PROSECUTOR. 
THE LAWMAKERS, THE OLDER MEN, 
THEY WON'T BE GRILLING THE 
ACCUSER HERE OR BRETT KAVANAUGH 
BUT RACHEL MITCHELL WILL. 
WHAT WILL YOU BE WATCHING FOR? 
BECAUSE THE FEELING IS THAT 
THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT THE 
OPTICS BUT DO YOU THINK 
SUBSTITUTING THEM FOR A WOMAN 
IS GOING REMEDY THAT PROBLEM? 
>> I THINK FOR SOME PEOPLE 
THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO BE 
SATISFIED. 
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY THIS IS 
OUT OF PRECEDENCE AND NOT THE 
WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE BUT 
CLEARLY THE REPUBLICANS HAVE 
LEARNED A LESSON FROM CERTAINLY 
CLARENCE THOMAS AND HOW IT 
LOOKS AND PERCEIVED AND SHOULD 
THE NOMINATION MOVE FORWARD AND 
GET AFFIRMATIVE VOTE. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE PIVOTAL IN 
THAT. 
IN TERMS OF THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC'S ABILITY TO ACCEPT THAT 
IT WAS A FAIR PROCESS FOR 
CERTAINLY DR. FORD AND FOR THE 
JUDGE. 
SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT WHAT IS 
THE FAIREST WAY TO DEPOLITICIZE 
EXACTLY WHAT VLAD WAS TALKING 
ABOUT. 
YOU SEE ALL THE PROTESTORS, 
IT'S VERY HEIGHTENED POLITICAL 
SENSE. 
AND THE THING WE HAVE TO KEEP 
IN MIND IS THAT IT'S VERY 
FLUID. 
IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SENTIMENTS. 
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE 
ALREADY DECIDED THAT THEY'RE 
CONVINCED AND THEY BELIEVE DR. 
FORD, ALL DUE RESPECT TO THEM 
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF FLUIDITY 
AND EVEN YESTERDAY, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS MOVING BACK AND 
FORTH IN TERMS OF HOW HE -- HOW 
SOLID HE WAS IN TERMS OF 
SUPPORT OR BEING OPEN-MINDED. 
AND IF YOU LOOK AT JUST -- I 
WAS GOING TO SAY VLAD, THERE'S 
A NEW MORNING CONSULT POLITICAL 
REPORT SURVEY I'M SORRY, THAT 
SHOWS THAT REPUBLICAN WOMEN 
HAVE LOST SUPPORT FOR BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BY 11 POINTS, SO 
THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEGATIVE 
EFFECT THAT ALL THIS IS HAVING 
ON HIM. 
>> ANNE MARIE MENTIONED THERE 
ARE SOME LESSONS THAT HAVE 
HOPEFULLY BEEN LEARNED FROM THE 
1991 CLARENCE THOMAS AND HILL 
HEARINGS. 
BUT I WONDER, BECAUSE AS I OVER 
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, HAVE 
LISTENED TO SENATOR GRAHAM TO 
SENATOR JOHN CORNYN, TO SENATOR 
ORRIN HATCH WHO LET'S REMEMBER 
WAS VERY, VERY TOUGH AND 
ULTIMATELY CRITICIZED FOR THE 
WAY THAT HE WENT AFTER ANITA 
HILL DURING THE 1991 HEARING, 
THEY WAS THERE ON THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AT THE 
TIME. 
AS I HAVE LISTENED TO THEM. 
THEIR AGGRESSION TOWARDS 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD HAS 
BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE 
VOCIFEROUS AND MORE VOCAL. 
JOHN CORNYN TO HIS CREDIT HAS 
SAID LOOK, WE NEED TO HEAR FROM 
HER. 
I WANT TO TREAT HER WITH THE 
SAME RESPECT THAT I WOULD MY 
WIFE. 
MY DAUGHTER. 
MY MOM. 
BUT ORRIN HATCH AND NOW LINDSAY 
GRAHAM HAVE REALLY GONE ON THE 
OFFENSIVE AND I WONDER IF THEY 
ARE NOT PERHAPS READING THE TEA 
LEAVES THE WAY YOU ARE. 
I'M SURE THEY ARE. 
THEY HAVE A STAFF AND EVERYONE 
OUT THERE TELLING THEM WHAT THE 
VIBE IN THE COUNTRY IS BUT IT 
ALMOST FEELS AS IF THEY ARE 
PERSONALLY AFFRONTED BY THE 
ACCUSATIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT 
AND MAYBE THEY'RE CONFLATING 
THE NUMEROUS ACCUSATIONS THAT 
HAVE COME OUT SINCE HERS BUT 
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THERE TODAY. 
>> DO YOU KNOW WHO ELSE HAS 
CHANGED HIS APPROACH? 
THE PRESIDENT. 
INWOUNDER IF THEY'RE FOLLOWING 
HIS LEAD AS WELL. 
>> Reporter: LET'S MAKE YOUNG 
MEN AND HIMSELF HE'S BEEN 
VICTIMIZED BY ALL THE FALSE 
ACCUSATIONS. 
OR YOU KNOW NEARLY TWO DOZEN 
WOMEN. 
THAT HAVE COME FORWARD AND HAVE 
ACCUSED HIM OF VERY SIMILAR 
THINGS AND HE HAS A VERY 
PARTICULAR LENS. 
A PERSONAL LENS BY WHICH WE 
VIEWS THIS. 
AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY PEOPLE 
IN BASE AMERICA AND OTHERS WHO 
FEEL THE SAME WAY AND IT'S 
ALMOST LIKE YOU ARE HEARING THE 
SENATORS ECHO THAT SENTIMENT. 
AND PART OF IT IS, THE 
OVERREACH. 
IT'S NOW IT EMS LIKE IT'S 
KIND OF PILING ON ALL THESE 
DIFFERENT ANONYMOUS LETTERS. 
MAYBE I RECOLLECT IT. 
MAYBE I DON'T. 
AND THE DIFFERENCE IS, DR. 
FORD, IT'S REALLY GOING TO 
COMMA KNOW A MA KNOW. 
HAND TO HAND -- COME MANO E 
MANO. 
VERY STRONG APPEAL -- ON BOTH 
SIDES. 
>> ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IN OUR 
FRIEND. 
WHO IS JOINING US ALSO FROM 
WASHINGTON, D.C.. 
LINDA TRAN. 
YOU ARE THE FOUNDING PARTNER OF 
270 STRATEGIES AND YOU ARE 
JOINING US FROM WASHINGTON. 
ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON OUR 
PANEL. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> SO LET ME ASK YOU SORT OF A 
SIMILAR QUESTION. 
WE ALL HAVE NOW SEEN THAT 
PHOTOGRAPH. 
THAT WAS SNAPPED BY OUR BEAU 
ERICSON OF SENATOR MURKOWSKI 
AND FEINSTEIN SOMEWHERE IN THE 
CAPITOL BUILDING AND MAYBE 
THROW THAT PICTURE UP. 
BUT IT SHOWS SORT OF THE 
INTENSE DISCUSSION THAT SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN IS HAVING WITH LISA 
MURKOWSKI. 
WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT? 
BECAUSE MURKOWSKI AND COLLINS 
AND BOB CORKER AND JEFF FLAKE 
ARE THOSE SENATORS WHICH ARE 
SORT OF UNDECIDED. 
AT LEAST IN PUBLIC STATEMENTS 
THAT THEY'VE MADE. 
UNDECIDED ABOUT WHERE THEY 
ULTIMATELY WILL VOTE. 
AND HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE COME OUT. 
AT THE VERY LEAST, SOME OF THEM 
HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE SENATE 
SHOULD OR THE PRESIDENT SHOULD 
ASK THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE 
THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
ALL EYES WILL BE ON THEM. 
THE HOW MUCH -- HOW MUCH 
INFLUENCE DO YOU THINK THAT 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN FOR EXAMPLE 
WILL HAVE ON HER FRIENDS 
BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT. 
THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE FRIENDS 
AND THEY'RE COLLEAGUES AND THEY 
DO TALK TO EACH OTHER BEYOND 
THE CAMERAS. 
>> YES. 
I MEAN, IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS 
WHAT PRECISELY THEY WERE 
TALKING ABOUT AS YOU SAID IN 
THE BOWELS THERE. 
BUT YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WAS APPEALING 
TO SENATOR MURKOWSKI TO GIVE 
THE ACCUSER A CHANCE TO STATE 
HER CASE. 
TO LISTEN TO THE DETAILS THAT 
SHE PROVIDES. 
TO LISTEN TO THE RESPONSES THAT 
SHE OFFERS TODAY TO THE 
QUESTIONS THAT WE'LL HEAR FROM 
THE PROSECUTOR. 
BEFORE SHE MAKES A DECISION. 
ALSO IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT IN 
ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT 
SENATOR MURKOWSKI IS GOING TO 
BE A KEY VOTE IN THAT 
PARTICULAR SCENARIO, ALSO BEEN 
ESSENTIALLY A SWING VOTE ON 
SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT 
HAVE COME BEFORE THE SENATE 
DURING THE TRUMP 
ADMINISTRATION. 
INCLUDING THEIR EFFORT TO 
REPEAL THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. 
SO LISA MURKOWSKI IS USED TO 
BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT. 
SHE IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS MADE A 
CAREER OUT OF DEMONSTRATING HER 
INDEPENDENCE. 
AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE WILL 
LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS TODAY 
WITH GREAT ATTENTION. 
>> LINDA, I'M CURIOUS ABOUT 
YOUR POINT OF VIEW. 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK 
ABOUT REPUBLICAN SENATORS LIKE 
JEFF FLAKE AND YOU KNOW WHETHER 
OR NOT THEY ALL DECIDE NOD TO 
VOTE IN -- NOT TO VOTE IN FAVOR 
OF HIM. 
BUT THERE ARE DEMOCRATS TOO 
LIKE JOE MANCHIN WHO ARE 
FACTORING IN THAT HE'S COMING 
FROM A SPREAD STATE. 
IS THERE ANY ANSWER -- RED 
STATE. 
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT 
REPUBLICANS COULD VOTE IN HIS 
FAIR OR IN THIS ENVIRONMENT 
THAT'S -- FAVOR OR IN THIS 
ENVIRONMENT THAT'S NEVER GOING 
TO HAPPEN? 
DEMOCRATS RATHER. 
>> DEMOCRATS, THE SENATORS WHO 
ARE ALSO UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT 
AND CERTAINLY INCLUDE SENATOR 
MANSION. 
BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT 
ACTUALLY THE DSCC JUST PULLED 
SOME OF THEIR DEDICATED BUDGET 
TO ADVERTISEMENTS IN SUPPORT OF 
HIM. 
SO THERE'S A SENSE THAT HE'S IN 
A PRETTY GOOD POSITION AND 
HONESTLY, THE FACT THAT DR. 
FORD HAS COME FORWARD AND SOME 
OF THESE OTHER ACCUSATIONS HAVE 
OCCURRED, MAKES IT SOMEWHAT 
EASIER FOR EVEN THE RED STATE 
DEMOCRATS THAT WE'VE BEEN 
WATCHING TO POTENTILLY VOTE 
NO. 
DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY 
VOTED TO SUPPORT KNEEL GORSUCH 
LAST -- NEIL GORSUCH LAST GO 
ROUND. 
>> THE RESULTS OF THE TEST ARE 
NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TODAY. 
THE DOCUMENTS SHOW FORD TEST 
THE TEST ON -- TOOK THE TEST ON 
AUGUST 7th AND PASSED. 
CBS NEWS POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT ED O'KEEFE SPOKE 
WITH THE FORMER FBI AGENT WHO 
CONDUCTED THE POLYGRAPH EXAM. 
LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THAT. 
>> ALTER BEHAVIOR, I FELT HER 
ANSWERS DURING THE INTERVIEW 
WERE VERY APPROPRIATE. 
SO AGAIN, SHE WAS NERVOUS AND 
EVERYBODY WHO TAKES THE TEST -- 
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS NERVOUS AND 
EVERYBODY WHO TAKES THE 
POLYGRAPH TEST IS NERVOUS. 
I THOUGHT ALL THE BEHAVIORS AND 
ALL HER ANSWERS I THOUGHT 
EVERYTHING THAT SHE DID WAS 
APPROPRIATE. 
WHAT WE BASICALLY CALL IT WAS 
AN UNREMARKABLE POLYGRAPH TEST. 
>> BUT IS HER INNER TRUTH, WHAT 
SHE BELIEVES TO BE TRUE, 
POTENTIALLY NOT THE ACTUAL 
TRUTH? 
>> PEOPLE SOMETIMES THINK OKAY. 
IF I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS 
EVENT HAPPENED, THEN I CAN PASS 
A POLYGRAPH. 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE. 
THAT CAN HAPPEN. 
HOWEVER, YOU -- THAT'S ONE OF 
THE REASONS YOU DO YOUR 
INTERVIEW BEFOREHAND. 
OKAY? 
YOU ASKED QUESTIONS AND YOU 
ASKED FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS OKAY? 
IS THAT A POSSIBILITY TO 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT COULD 
HAPPEN? 
ABSOLUTELY. 
BUT IN MY OPINION, AND AFTER 
HER PASSING THE TEST AND MY 
INTERACTION WITH HER, I DON'T 
THINK SHE'S MISTAKEN. 
>> YOU KNOW, LESLIE I THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE TEST BE 
SUBMITTED TO THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
BECAUSE YOU HAVE HEARD PEOPLE 
EVERYONE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES TO SURROGATES 
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH SEEMINGLY 
SUGGESTING THAT WHAT WE'RE 
WITNESSING WHEN IT COMES TO 
THESE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE ARE 
SOMEHOW AND TO USE THE 
PRESIDENT'S WORDS, A CON JOB. 
THAT THIS -- THIS PERSON, THIS 
DOCTOR, WOKE UP ONE DAY AND 
SAID YOU KNOW WHAT? 
I DON'T LIKE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
AND I'M GOING TO PUT MY 
FAMILY'S LIFE OUT THERE AND 
BUTT MY KIN -- PUT MY 
CHILDREN'S LIFE OUT THERE AND 
I'M GOING TO COME OUT AND 
SUGGEST SOMETHING THAT'S 
EXPLOSIVE SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M A 
TOOL OF THE DEMOCRATS. 
NOW ALL THE OTHER PEOPLE ARE 
ALSO SOME KIND OF A PLOT TO 
DERAIL WRECK'S NOMINATION. 
-- BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION. 
WHEREAS WE DIDN'T SEE THAT WITH 
NEIL GORSUCH OR JOHN ROBERTS OR 
ALL THE OTHER SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES THAT HAVE COME SINCE 
CLARENCE THOMAS. 
SO ISN'T IT IMPORTANT FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS ON THE COMMITTEE 
AND THE REPUBLICANS WHO MAKE UP 
THE SENATE AS A WHOLE, TO NOT 
SEEMINGLY IMPUGN HER CHARACTER 
JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE 
SUPPORTIVE OF BRETT KAVANAUGH? 
>> EXACTLY RIGHT. 
BECAUSE THE DEFAULT WAS -- THE 
KNEE JERK RESPONSE, WE WILL 
SUPPORT BRETT KAVANAUGH AT ALL 
COSTS. 
THERE'S NOTHING, AFTER SIX FBI 
INVESTIGATIONS, AFTER TWO 
CONFIRMATIONS, TO BELIEVE THAT 
HE WOULD HAVE THIS IN HIS 
CHARACTER. 
BUT NO ONE WITHIN BACK AND 
ASKED WHAT YOU DID AT THE HIGH 
SCHOOL PARTY RIGHT? 
SO THIS IS A NEW AREA WE'RE 
GOING INTO. 
IT'S THE VERIES ARETY OF 
INDEPENDENCE -- VORACITY OF 
INDEPENDENCE. 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO CHALLENGE 
SOMEBODY OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
CHARACTER. 
AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS HARD TO 
TAKE THE POLITICAL ASPECT FROM 
REALLY HOW SERIOUS THIS 
ALLEGATION IS AND THAT'S WHY I 
THINK FUNDAMENTALLY IT COMES 
DOWN TO THE TWO PEOPLE. 
NOT THE OTHER NOISE OF OTHER 
KIND OF INSTANTED AND -- 
UNSUBSTANTIATED AND SOME WOULD 
ARGUES THIS UNSUBSTANTIATED. 
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
DESERVE THIS IS AMOUNT OF 
RESPECT. 
>> WHY ARE THE MALE SENATORS SO 
INCLINED TO GO ON TELEVISION 
AND FOX NEWS AND BE 
DISBELIEVING OF HER ASSERTIONS 
BUT ARE UNWILLING TO SATE IN A 
LINE OF FIRE -- SIT IN A LINE 
OF FIRE AND QUESTION HER WHEN 
SHE'S STANDING RIGHT IS THERE? 
>> THE TRUTH IS THEY'RE SO 
CYNICAL. 
I MEAN ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN IN 
WASHINGTON THIS LONG FINDS IT 
HARD TO BELIEVE THAT AN HONEST 
PERSON WOULD COME FORWARD AFTER 
30 MANAGER YEARS. 
THEY -- SOMETHING YEAR, VERSUS 
A POLITICALLY CONCAVED 
MOTIVATOR AND YOU HAVE SCHUMER 
IN THE BACK ROOM WRINGING HIS 
HANDS TRYING TO ORCHESTRATE 
THIS. 
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AND 
THERE'S STILL GOING TO BE 
PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE THAT 
REGARDLESS WHAT HAPPENS TODAY. 
>> WOW. 
THERE ARE PROTESTORS IN THIS 
SIDE THAT ROOM SHARON -- THAT 
ROOM SHARON. 
>> OUTSIDE, OUR PRODUCER 
TELLING THE PROTESTORS ARE 
OUTSIDE AND POLICE ARE SORT 
AFTER APPEASING AS WELL -- OF 
AMASSING AS WELL OUTSIDE. 
WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS 
HERE AND EMOTIONS ARE RUNNING 
HIGH AND YOU CAN SEE AT LEAST 
ONE PROTESTER THERE WITH TEARS 
IN THEIR EYES. 
SEVERAL HAVE SHIRTS THAT SAY 
THEIR SURVIVORS. 
THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH. 
AND VERY PERSONAL FOR A LOT OF 
PEOPLE. 
BUT CERTAINLY THE PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE GATHERED HERE. 
SO WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON WHAT'S 
GOING ON HERE. 
LESLIE AND LINDA YOU ARE GOING 
TO BE WITH US ALL MORNING LONG 
AND TAPPING INTO YOUR 
EXPERTISE. 
>> YEAH AND IN FACT ONE NOTE 
FROM OUR ED O'KEEFE HE CONFIRMS 
FOR US IS DR. BLASEY FORD. 
HER HUSBAND AND CHILDREN ARE IN 
WASHINGTON. 
SHE MADE THE -- NOT IN 
WASHINGTON. 
SHE MADE THE TRIP SOMEWHERE 
SOME CLOSE FRIENDS. 
YOU CAN -- WITH SOME FRIENDS. 
YOU CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND, 
SHE SAYS SHE IS AFRAID TO BE 
HERE. 
>> COMING UP AFTER THE BREAK 
THE PRESIDENT LASHED OUT AT 
REPORTERS AND PRAISED BRETT 
KAVANAUGH DURING A RARE NEWS 
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY. 
>>> UP NEXT, WE'LL HEAR FROM 
OUR WEIJIA JIANG WHO WAS THERE 
AND GOT CAUGHT IN THE 
CROSSFIRE. 
>>> IF I COULD JUST ACTUALLY 
AND MY QUESTION MR. TRUMP. 
>> YOU'VE BEEN ASKING YOUR 
QUESTION FOR TEN MINUTES, 
PLEASE SIT DOWN. 
PLEASE GO AHEAD. 
>>> WE ARE LESS THAN AN HOUR 
AWAY FROM THE STAT OF THE HIGH 
STAKES HEARING AT THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHERE 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND ONE OF HIS 
ACCUSERS CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD 
WILL TESTIFY. 
>> SAMANTHA GARY IS A FORMER 
CLASSMATE AND 40 YEAR FRIEND OF 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 
EARLIER SHEWAS ON "CBS THIS 
MORNING." 
>> SOME OF THE QUESTIONING 
ABOUT HER RECOLLECTION OF THIS 
EVENT IS CENTERED AROUND THE 
SPECIFICITY ON THE ONE HAND BUT 
ALSO THE VAGUENESS ON THE OTHER 
HAND. 
IN TERMS OF HER ACCOUNT. 
HOW DO YOU SORT THROUGH THOSE 
DETAILS? 
IS IT POSSIBLE IN YOUR MIND 
WHILE YOU BELIEVE YOUR FRIEND 
AND YOU BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING 
HAPPENED, ARE YOU AS CERTAIN 
THAT IT WAS THIS SPECIFIC 
PERSON, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, THAT 
WAS INVOLVED IN WHATEVER 
HAPPENED? 
>> I AM. 
I AM. 
I THINK IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED 
FROM EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN 
HEARING AS WELL AS THROUGH THE 
NEWS AND WHATNOT THAT YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THESE TYPES 
OF TRAUMAS HAVE ACUTE MEMORY OF 
A LOTO DETAILS AND THERE ARE -- 
OF DETAILS AND THERE ARE A LOT 
OF THINGS THAT ARE SOMEWHAT 
VAGUE. 
I THINK THAT'S FAIRLY TYPICAL. 
BLUE THIS CASE HUH -- BUT IN 
THIS CASE SHE KNEW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND SHE KNEW WHO WAS 
ATTACKING HER AND THERE'S NO 
QUESTION ABOUT HIS ISOLATE. 
MISS -- IDENTITY. 
THIS IS SOMETHING SHE'S BEEN 
CLEAR ON SINCE THE BEGINNING 
AND EVERIEN STANCE THAT -- 
INSTANCE THAT SHE BROUGHT THE 
INFORMATION FORWARD TO A 
FRIEND. 
>> OKAY SAMANTHA GARY THANKS SO 
MUCH. 
>> MY PLEASURE. 
>> AND ADAM BLAKE IS A SENIOR 
POLITICAL REPORTER FOR THE 
"WASHINGTON POST" AND JOINS US 
NOW FROM WASHINGTON. 
SO AARON, A FULL SENATE VOTE 
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH'S CON FIR 
MISSION COULD BE MUCH CLOSER 
THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. 
REPUBLICANS JEFF FLAKE AND BOB 
CORKER ARE TWO SENATORS WHO 
APPEAR TO BE UNDECIDED THOUGH. 
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAID 
YESTERDAY. 
>> IF WE CANNOT HAVE A HUMAN 
RATHER THAN A POLITICAL 
RESPONSE TO THESE WITNESSES, IF 
WE ARE HEEDLESS TO THE CAPACITY 
THAT WE HAVE TO DO REAL AND 
LASTING DAMAGE THEN WE 
SHOULDN'T BE HERE. 
>> I ENTERED THIS HEARING WITH 
GOOD FEELINGS ABOUT OUR 
NOMINEE. 
AND MY PERSONAL INTERACTIONS 
WITH HIM AND THE FIRST HEARING. 
BUT LOOK, I MEAN, MY JOB IS TO 
TAKE IN ALL THE INFORMATION AND 
TOMORROW I'LL BE LISTENING TO 
EVERY WORD OF WHAT HAPPENS. 
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING 
ADDITIONAL THAT HAPPENS, I DO 
THE SAME THING. 
>> ALL RIGHT AARON AND THAT'S 
CORKER AND FLAKE. 
THE OTHER TWO THAT PEOPLE ARE 
CLOSELY WATCHING, MURKOWSKI AND 
COLLINS, WHAT ARE YOU HEARING 
FROM YOUR SOURCES ABOUT WHERE 
THEY ARE TODAY? 
>> I THINK THAT JEFF FLAKE'S 
COMMENTS YESTERDAY WERE THE 
MOST TELLING. 
HE TALKED ABOUT THE IDEA THAT 
THIS HEARING, THE VOTE ON IT 
RATHER, THAT IS SCHEDULED FOR 
FRIDAY, MIGHT HAVE TO BE 
DELAYED IF SOMETHING COMES OUT 
OF THIS HEARING THAT NEEDS TO 
BE REVIEWED. 
HE SEEMS TO BE AT LEAST 
PUBLICLY EXPRESSING OPENNESS TO 
A DELAY. 
AND THIS IS A GUY WHO COULD 
PREVENT THE COMMITTEE FROM 
VOTING FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
HE IS ONE PERSON ON A COMMITTEE 
THAT'S SPLIT 11-10 FOR 
REPUBLICANS WHO COULD TOWARD 
THAT VOTE. 
THEY -- THWART THAT VOTE. 
THEY COULD CONFIRM BRETT 
KAVANAUGH ON THE FULL SENATE 
ANYWAYS WITHOUT THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE'S 
ENDORSEMENT OF HIM BUT THAT 
WOULD BE A HIGHLY UNUSUAL SET 
OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND I THINK 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MORE 
DIFFICULT GIVEN THE CLOSE -- 
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT GIVEN THE 
CLOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. 
>> THAT'S NOT ALL THAT THESE 
LAWMAKERS WILL BE CONSIDERING. 
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS DO 
YOU BELIEVE THEY'LL BE TAKING 
INTO CONSIDERATION? 
>> WELL, I THINK A LOT OF IT IS 
GOING TO BE NOT NECESSARILY DID 
THIS HAPPEN OR DID THIS NOT 
HAPPEN? 
A LOT OF IT IS GOING TO BE 
RECOUPABLING DETAILS OF WHAT -- 
RECOUNTING DETAILS OF WHAT 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH HAVE SAID ABOUT THIS 
SITUATION. 
GOING THROUGH THEIR ACCOUNTS OF 
THIS, WHICH IN SOME KEY DETAILS 
HAVE CONTRASTED WITH ONE 
ANOTHER AND TRYING TO FIGURE 
OUT THE EITHER OF THEM CAN BE 
ESTABLISHED AS BEING MORE 
CREDIBLE THAN THE OTHER ONE. 
A KEY DIFFERENCE THAT I NOTICED 
YESTERDAY IN THE POLYGRAPH 
REPORT THAT CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD THE GAVE, SHE -- SHE GAVE. 
SHE SAID SHE DATED ONE OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S FRIENDS. 
ALBEIT BRETT KAVANAUGH IN HIS 
FOX NEWS INTERVIEW SUGGESTED 
THAT THEY REALLY WEREN'T IN THE 
SAME SOCIAL CIRCLES THAT HE 
MIGHT HAVE MET HER. 
AND REALLY DOWNPLAYED THE IDEA 
THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO SHE 
WAS FAMILIAR WITH. 
AND SO YOU MIGHT SEE THE 
PROSECUTOR FOR REPUBLICANS AND 
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS TRY AND 
ESTABLISH WHICH OF THOSE CLAIMS 
IS MORE CLOSE TO REALITY AND I 
THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S 
IMPORTANT HERE IS WHICH PERSON 
COMES OUT OF THIS HEARING 
LOOKING MORE CREDIBLE AND 
LOOKING MORE CONSISTENT. 
>> AS YOU KNOW AARON, 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS ON THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ARE 
NOT EXPECTED TO QUESTION THE 
WITNESSES. 
THEY WILL LIKELY YIELD TO 
RACHEL MITCHELL. 
THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. 
WHAT ARE THE OPTICS OF THAT? 
>> WELL, CERTAINLY THEY WANTED 
TO AVOID HAVING 11 WHITE MEN ON 
THE COMMITTEE OLDER WHITE MEN 
AND A LOT OF CASES, GO AFTER 
THIS PERSON WHO'S MAKING A VERY 
SERIOUS ACCUSATION, ANYBODY WHO 
LISTENS TO THE TAPES OF THE 
CLARENCE THOMAS HEARINGS IN 
WHICH REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 
VERY FORCEFULLY QUESTIONING 
ANITA HILL IN WAYS THAT DON'T 
NECESSARILY REFLECT VERY WELL 
UPON THEM 27 YEARS LATER, WILL 
UNDERSTAND THAT DECISION. 
I THINK THAT IF YOU WERE BEHIND 
THE SCENES RIGHT NOW, YOU 
PROBABLY WOULD SEE MITCH 
McCONNELL AND JUDICIARY 
CHAIRMAN CHUCK GRASSLEY 
ADVISING ALL THE REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS TO STAY OUT OF THIS 
AND NOT TALK EVEN IF THEY THINK 
THEY HAVE A REALLY IMPORTANT 
POINT MAKE BECAUSE THE DOWNSIDE 
OF HAVING A REALLY BAD MOMENT 
IS SO SIGNIFICANT. 
>> AARON BLAKE, THANK YOU SO 
MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> ALL RIGHT. 
SO TODAY'S HEARING WILL LIKELY 
COME DOWN TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
WORD AGAINST HIS ACCUSERS. 
>> JENNA ELLIS IS A ATTORNEY 
AND JOINS US NOW FROM DENVER. 
SO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING HIS 
NOMINEE. 
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS FLATLY 
DENIED ALL THE ALLEGATIONS 
AGAINST HIM. 
SO WHY DO YOU BELIEVE HE'S 
TELLING THE TRUTH AND NOT DR. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD? 
DEBORAH RAMIREZ AND ALSO JULIE 
SWETNICK. 
>> WELL -- WELL, I DON'T THINK 
THAT THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED 
YET. 
WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THE 
CONTEXT OF THE SENATE 
CONFIRMATION HEARING. 
THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL TRIAL. 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A 
VERDICT OR FINDING OF GUILT. 
WE'RE LOOKING FOR FAIRNESS IN 
THE PROCESS AND WE'RE LOOKING 
TO MAKE SURE THAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S ACTUALLY FIT FOR 
OFFICE. 
THE SENATE UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION IS VESTED WITH THE 
POWER TO ADVISE AND ULTIMATELY 
CONSENT OR NOT TO A JUDICIAL 
NOMINEE. 
WHAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER FROM A 
BIG PICTURE PERSPECTIVE IS THAT 
THIS IS ABOUT FUNDAMENTALLY 
WHAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC 
BELIEVES ABOUT DUE PROCESS. 
AND HOW WE UNDERSTAND THE 
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS TO 
COMMENCE AND WE NEED TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING 
HERE TO JUST SIMPLY BELIEVE ONE 
OVER THE OTHER BUT WE NEED TO 
MAKE SURE THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
HAS THE PRESUMPTION OF 
INNOCENCE. 
FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AND WE 
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 
PRESERVE ASKING PROTECTING OUR 
RULE -- PRESERVING AND 
PROTECTING OUR RULE OF LAW. 
THE FACT THAT ONE WOMAN'S 
ALLEGATION THAT'S 
UNCORROBORATED AND INSTANTED 
ABSENT SOMETHING -- 
UNSUBSTANTIATED ABSENT 
SOMETHING ELSE COMING OUT IN 
THE HEARING IS SETTINGS THIS UP 
TO BE A POLITICAL QUESTION 
RATHER THAN ADHERING TO THE 
RULE OF LOYALTY. 
>> WE HAVE YOU KNOW -- LAW 
ULTIMATELY. 
>> WE HAVE YOU KNOW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER. 
NO OTHER WAY OF SORT OF 
VERIFYING EITHER OF THEIR 
STORY. 
DO YOU THINK WE CAN COME OUT 
WITH A CLEAR ANSWER AS TO WHO'S 
TELLING THE TRUTH AND WHO'S NOT 
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES? 
>> TRUTH NEEDS TO BE THE 
ULTIMATE QUESTION BUT HERE THE 
STANDARD OF COURSE WITH SENATE 
CONFIRMATION HEARING CONTEXT, 
WE DON'T HAVE A CLEAR LEGAL 
STANDARD OF PROOF. 
SO IT NEEDS TO BE ONE AT 
MINIMUM OF REASONABLENESS. 
IS THE ALLEGATION IN THE 
CONTEXT OF EVERYTHING WE DO 
KNOW TO BE TRUE? 
EVERYTHING THAT IS ON THE 
RECORD OF BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
CLEAR HISTORY OF QUALIFICATIONS 
AND HIS SIX FBI BACKGROUND 
CHECKS SINCE 1993, ALL OF THE 
THINGS THAT WE DO KNOW ARE 
TRUE. 
IS THIS REALLY REASONABLE? 
WHAT SHE'S CLAIMING VERSUS HIS 
EMINENT QUALIFICATION. 
DR. JAMES DOBSON WHO'S MY BOSS 
WAS QUOTED ON CBS ACTUALLY 
YESTERDAY SAYING UNLESS THERE'S 
SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S COMING 
OUT AND THERE'S SOME OTHER 
EVIDENCE. 
HE WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND I WOULD AGREE 
WITH THAT ASSESS. 
THIS HAS BECOME -- ASSESSMENT. 
THIS HAS BECOME A POLITICAL 
CIRCUS. 
>> YOU KNOW, YOU RAISE A GOOD 
POINT ABOUT THE PRESUMPTON OF 
INNOCENCE. 
BUT THIS ISN'T A COURT OF LAW. 
THERE IS A CREDIBILITY ISSUE AT 
PLAY HERE. 
AND AT THE VERY LEAST, WHEN 
BRETT KAVANAUGH DOES A 
TELEVISION INTERVIEW, AND HE 
DOWNPLAYS THE AMOUNT OF THE 
DRINKING THAT HE HAS DONE AS A 
YOUNG MAN OR EVEN AS AN ADULT 
AND THEN THESE ALLEGATIONS COME 
OUT WHERE THEY SEEM TO SUGGEST 
THAT HE LIKES TO PARTY. 
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT 
BUT TO SUGGEST AS HE DID THAT 
HE DOESN'T DO THOSE THINGS, 
THAT'S WHERE YOU START TO SEE 
THIS CREDIBILITY GAP. 
IT'S NOTE A QUESTION OF THE 
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE. 
WHICH WAS OF COURSE INTEGRAL TO 
OUR RULE OF LAW. 
THIS IS ABOUT A MAN WHO SAYS HE 
DOESN'T DO EVEN REMOTELY SOME 
OF THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
SAID THAT'S OKAY TO DO. 
IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A COUPLE OF 
BEERS. 
>> HE DOESN'T KNOW ANY OF THE 
WOMEN AT ALL. 
>> I WONDER IF THE CORRECT GAP 
IS -- CREDIBILITY GAP IS WHY 
PERHAPS WHAT DR. FORD'S 
ALLEGATIONS ARE SHOULD BE AT 
LEAST LISTENED TO AND AT SOME 
LEVEL THERE'S GOT TO BE AN 
UNDERSTANDING SHE WOULDN'T COME 
OUT AND SAY THE THINGS BECAUSE 
SHE WANTS TO PUT HERSELF AND 
HER FAMILY UNDER THE GLARE OF 
SPOTLIGHT. 
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF 
ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU JUST SAID. 
THAT HE'S DOWNPLAYING THE 
ALLEGATIONS AND QUESTIONING HER 
MOTIVE OF SAYING YOU KNOW SHE 
WOULDN'T HAVE COME FORWARD 
UNLESS SHE WAS TELLING THE 
TRUTH. 
THOSE ARE ALL ASSUMPTIONS. 
THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF 
REASONS WHY SOMEONE MAY COME 
FORWARD WITH THIS TYPE OF 
ALLEGATION. 
CERTAINLY THAT THE DEMOCRATS 
HAVE HELD ON TO THIS EVIDENCE 
UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THE 
CONFIRMATION -- 
>> HE SAID HE DOESN'T DRINK. 
>> EVEN JUST THE STORY ITSELF. 
>> HE SAYS HE DOESN'T DRINK. 
HE SAYS HE ONLY HAD A COUPLE OF 
BEERS HERE AND THERE. 
INCLUDING FROM HIS FRIEND, MARK 
JUDGE, SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT HE 
HAS MORE THAN A COUPLE OF BEERS 
AND HAS HAD THAT HABIT FOR 
MANY, MANY YEARS. 
>> AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO 
HAVE AT LEAST A STANDARD OF 
REASONABLENESS. 
I AGREE YOU THAT IT'S A 
CREDIBILITY ISSUE AND LOOKING 
AT HIS FUNDAMENTAL FITNESS FOR 
OFFICE WE STILL HAVE TO AGREE 
THAT HE HAS CONSTITUTIONAL 
PROTECTIONS HERE. 
WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
WE'RE NOT LITIGATING THIS IN 
THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION. 
WE'RE LITIGATING THIS IN REALLY 
THE SENATE CONFIRMATION 
HEARING. 
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS ACTUALLY 
ON THE RECORD. 
NOT ANYTHING THAT HAS JUST BEEN 
POSTED ON TWITTER, BY DEMOCRATS 
LOOKING TO DELAY AND DERAIL THE 
PROCESS. 
BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE 
HISTORIC DAY IN AMERICA. 
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 
PREFERRING AND PRESECT -- 
PRESERVING AND PROTECTING OUR 
CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR 
JUDICIAL NOMINEES AND THEY ARE 
NOT DERAILED JUST BASTED ON THE 
POLITICAL PARTY AFFILIATION. 
THE DEMOCRATS STARTED BY TRYING 
TO CONDEMN BRETT KAVANAUGH FOR 
HAVING KETCHUP ON THE PASTA AND 
NOW ACCUSING HIM ALL THE WAY UP 
TO GANG RAPE. 
IS THAT REALLY REASONABLE HERE 
IN THIS CONTEXT? 
OR IS THIS REALLY A POLITICAL 
TARGET? 
AND -- WE'RE ALWAYS CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE TRUTH. 
>> YOUR POINTS ARE ABSOLUTELY 
-- YOUR POINTS ARE WELL TAKEN 
BUT THE DEMOCRATS, IF YOU KNOW, 
THE IDEA THAT DEMOCRATS WOULD 
SOMEHOW BE DOING THIS BECAUSE 
IT'S A CON JOB AS THE PRESIDENT 
HAS SUGGESTED THEY DIDN'T DO 
THAT WITH JUDGE GORSUCH OR JOHN 
ROBERTS BECAUSE THERE WERE NO 
QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT 
THESE MEN MAY HAVE SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED WOMEN. 
SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS 
-- YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS TO BE 
THAT THE -- SURROGATES ARE 
SAYING FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS 
THESE THINGS ARE BEING DONE 
BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS WANT TO 
DERAIL THE PROCESS. 
WELL, THEY DIDN'T DERAIL IT 
WITH THESE EXPLOSIVE 
ALLEGATIONS FOR ALL THE OTHER 
MEN THAT ARE SITTING ON THE 
SUPREME COURT WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF JUDGE THOMAS. 
SO -- 
>> BUT THEY DID PUSH BACK ON 
NEIL GORSUCH. 
SENATOR McCONNELL AND OTHERS 
HAD TO INVOKE THE NUCLEAR 
OPTION. 
REMEMBER THAT HAPPENED WITH 
WHAT? 
BUT THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT 
CONTEXT. 
I WROTE A PIECE FOR THE 
"WASHINGTON EXAMINER" THIS WEEK 
THAT'S TALKING ABOUT THE 
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE THAT'S REALLY 
ON THE LINE HERE IS PRO-LIFE 
AND ABORTION. 
AND THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE 
FEARFUL OF LOSING. 
IS THE MAJORITY OF ACTIVISTS ON 
THE COURT. 
AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE THAT 
THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST BRETT 
KAVANAUGH HAVE INCREASED BY THE 
DEMOCRATS AND THEY ARE LOOKING 
SIMPLY TO DERAIL THE PROCESS. 
BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT 
THEY'RE LOSING THEIR ACTIVIST 
MAJORITY ON THE COURT. 
AND TO HAVE CONSERVATIVES WHO 
ARE ORIGINALISTS WHO WILL 
PROTECT AND PRESERVE EVERY 
PERSON'S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT 
INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF THE 
UNBORN BECAUSE THAT'S 
CONSISTENT WITH OUR 
CONSTITUTION. 
THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S ON THE 
LINE HERE. 
AND SO THIS IS MUCH, MUCH 
BIGGER THAN ONE CONFIRMATION 
HEARING. 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUPREME 
COURT FOR DECADES TO COME. 
FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR 
CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. 
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS 
ABOUT. 
>> I THINK EVERYBODY'S WELL 
AWARE OF IT WHICH IS WHY WE'RE 
WATCHING THE OUTCOME OF THIS SO 
CLOSELY. 
JENNA ELLIS THANK YOU SO MUCH. 
>> THANKS JENNA. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> ALL RIGHT, SO COMING UP 
AFTER THE BREAK, WE WILL TAKE 
YOU BACK TO 1991 TO ANOTHER 
HIGH STAKES HEARING BEFORE THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
THIS TIME, INVOLVING ANITA HILL 
AND CLARENCE THOMAS. 
>> WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THE 
SIMILARITIES AND THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT CASE 
AND WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW. 
YOU ARE STREAMING CBSN. 
>>> WELL, QUESTIONS ABOUT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION 
HEARING DOMINATED PRESIDENT 
TRUMP'S NEWS CONFERENCE 
YESTERDAY. 
THE PRESIDENT CONTINUED TO SHOW 
SUPPORT FOR THE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE BUT HE SAID HE WILL BE 
WATCHING CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD'S TESTIMONY TODAY. 
LEAVING HIMSELF A LITTLE BIT OF 
WIGGLE ROOM. 
>> YEAH SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING 
AT HERE IS THE CAMERA JUGGLING 
AROUND IS THE HALLWAY WHERE 
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE COMING 
IN AND OUT AS THEY HEAD TO THE 
HEARING ROOM. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS IN THE 
BUILDING RIGHT NOW AS WENS IT 
BUT YOU KNOW THE CAM -- WE 
UNDERSTAND IT BUT YOU KNOW THE 
CAMERA IS SETTING UP. 
THAT'S THE HALLWAY WE'LL BE 
WATCHING. 
THINGS GOT THENCE WHEN -- GOT 
TENSE WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS 
QUESTIONED BID WEIJIA JIANG -- 
BY WEIJIA JIANG ABOUT SEXUAL 
MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS GUEST 
HIM. 
>> Reporter: IF I COULD 
ACTUALLY ASK MY QUESTION MR. 
TRUMP. 
YOU DIDN'T LET ME. 
>> YOU HAVE BEEN ASKING THE 
QUESTION FOR TEN MINUTES. 
PLEASE GO AHEAD. 
>> Reporter: HOW DID THOSE 
IMPACT YOUR OPINIONS ON THE 
ALLEGATIONS -- 
>> IT DOES IMPACT MY OPINION 
YOU KNOW WHY? 
BECAUSE I'VE HAD A LOT OF FALSE 
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME. 
I'M A VERY FAMOUS PERSON 
UNFORTUNATELY. 
I'VE BEEN A FAMOUS PERSON FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
BUT I HAVE HAD A LOT OF FALSE 
CHARGES MADE AGAINST ME. 
REALLY FALSE CHARGES. 
I KNOW FRIENDS THAT HAVE HAD úF 
PEOPLE WANT FAME. 
THEY WANT MONEY. 
THEY WANT WHATEVER. 
SO WHEN I SEE IT, I VIEW IT 
DIFFERENTLY THAN SOMEBODY 
SITTING HOME WATCHING 
TELEVISION WHERE THEY SAY OH 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH THIS OR THAT. 
>> CBS NEWS WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WEIJIA JIANG IS 
WITH US NOW FROM JUST OUTSIDE 
OF TRUMP TOWER IN NEW YORK 
CITY. 
SO I THOUGHT THAT YOUR BACK AND 
FORTH WITH THE PRESIDENT DURING 
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WAS 
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST SORT 
OF ILLUMINATING COMPONENTS OF 
THAT PRESS CONFERENCE. 
AND HE DIDN'T JUST STOP AT THE 
LITTLE PIECE WE PLAYED. 
EVENTUALLY HE TALKED ABOUT HOW 
HE FEEL HE WAS THE VICTIM OF -- 
FELT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF FALSE 
ACCUSATIONS. 
>> I HAD IN FALSE CHARGES -- 
MANY FALSE CHARGES. 
I HAD A WOMAN SITTING IN AN 
AIRPLANE AND ATTACKED HER WHILE 
PEOPLING WERE COMING ON THE 
PLANE AND I HAVE A NUMBER ONE 
BEST SELLER OUT. 
I MEAN IT WAS A TOTAL PHONY 
STORY, MORE IN OF THEM. 
-- THERE ARE MANY OF THEM. 
SO WHEN YOU SAY DOES IT ATE 
TICKET ME WITH RESPECT TO -- 
AFFECT ME WITH RESPECT TO JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH? 
ABSOLUTELY. 
>> SO I BELIEVE HE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT A FLIGHT ATTENDANT ON 
THAT FLIGHT AND SHE STAND BY 
HER STORY. 
>> SHE DOES INDEED. 
>> SO BUT I WANT TO GET FROM 
YOU YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU TOOK 
FROM THAT BECAUSE I THOUGHT TO 
MYSELF OKAY I KNOW HE HAS SHADE 
HE'SING THERE -- SAID THAT HE'S 
WILLING TO LISTEN TO THE 
VICTIMS BUT THAT WAS VERY 
TELLING WHEN HE SAYS HIS POINT 
OF VIEW ON THE ACCUSATIONS IS 
INFORMED BY HIS OWN PERSONAL 
EXPERIENCES. 
AND WE KNOW THAT THE PRESIDENT 
HAS NEVER ADMITTED TO ANY 
WRONGDOING WHEN IT COMES TO 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 
>> Reporter: WELL, YOU KNOW 
WHAT I SHOULD CLARIFY -- 
THERE'S THE ACCESS HOLLYWOOD 
TAPE THAT HE DID. 
AGREE THERE WAS LOCKER ROOM 
TALK AND THEN LATER THERE WAS 
SOME REPORTING THAT HE EVEN 
QUESTIONED THE AUTHENTICITY OF 
THAT TAPE. 
BUT GO AHEAD. 
>> Reporter: RIGHT. 
YES. 
BUT YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I 
THOUGHT THIS CONTEXT WAS SO 
IMPORTANT. 
BECAUSE WHEN HE HEARD PRESIDENT 
TRUMP TALKING ABOUT THE 
KAVANAUGH ACCUSERS, YOU ARE 
RIGHT. 
IN THE BEGINNING, HE MADE CLEAR 
HE WANTED THEM TO SPEAK. 
HE WANTED TO HEAR THEIR STORY. 
BUT THEN HE FLIP-FLOPPED AND AT 
TIMES SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE 
LYING. 
AND HE WAS SO PASSIONATE ABOUT 
YOU KNOW, HOW ANNOYING IT IS TO 
ACCUSATIONS AND IT FELT VERY 
PERSONAL. 
NOT ONLY WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT 
THIS, BUT ALSO WHEN HE TWEETED 
ABOUT IT. 
POINTING OUT THAT THE THIRD 
ACCUSER IS REPRESENTED BY 
MICHAEL AVENATTI. 
WHO HE ALSO DUG INTO BECAUSE HE 
SAID AVENATTI BROUGHT FALSE 
CLAIMS AGAINST HIM. 
AND SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT STORY 
WE'RE REPORTING ON, WE WANT TO 
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSON AT 
THE CENTER OF IT WHO IS MAKING 
CLAIMS ABOUT THE STORY AND IN 
THIS CASE IT IS THE PRESIDENT. 
AND BECAUSE IT FELT SO 
PERSONAL, THAT'S WHY I PRESSED 
HIM ABOUT WHETHER THIS WAS 
COMING FROM HIS OWN EXPERIENCES 
AND SURE ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH IT 
TOOK GOADING, HE ACKNOWLEDGED 
THAT YES, BECAUSE HE HAD GONE 
THROUGH THIS HIMSELF. 
HE SAID ABSOLUTELY. 
THAT THIS IS GOING TO COLOR HIS 
VIEW OF THESE ACCUSATIONS AND 
HOW THE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 
HANDLED. 
>> AND YET, THROUGH THAT HOUR 
AND 20 MINUTE PRESS CONFERENCE, 
THERE, IF YOU READ THE TEE 
LEAVES -- TEA LEAVES, THERE DID 
APPEAR TO BE MOMENTS THROUGH 
THE THAT PRESS CONFERENCE WHERE 
THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO BE 
INDICATING THAT PERHAPS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S DEMEANOR IN THE FOX 
NEWS INTERVIEW AND HE HASN'T 
BEEN AS FORCEFUL AS THE 
PRESIDENT HAS IN DENYING PAST 
INSTANCES OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT, 
THERE WAS A LITTLE LIGHT AT THE 
END OF THE TUNNEL IN THAT THE 
PRESIDENT WOULD BE WILLING TO 
JETTISON KAVANAUH DEPENDING 
WHAT HE HEARS TODAY. 
YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS SAYING FROM 
McCONNELL TO GRAHAM SAYING THEY 
WANT TO GET THIS DONE AND SEAT 
HIM AS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. 
PRESIDENT SEEM TODAY OFFER A 
LITTLE LIGHT THERE. 
-- SEEMED TO OFFER A LITTLE 
LIGHT THERE. 
I WONDER IF YOU HAD THE SAME 
TAKE. 
>> Reporter: YEAH. 
AND I THINK AFTER HE WAS 
PRESSED ABOUT IT SEVERAL TIMES, 
AND AFTER HE FELT THE MOUNTING 
PRESSURE, AND HE YOU KNOW, 
LISTENED TO AS YOU MENTIONED, 
WHAT HIS FOLLOW REPUBLICANS 
WERE SAYING, HE HAS TO LEAVE 
SOME WIGGLE ROOM. 
CAN'T COMPLETELY SHUT THE DOOR 
BECAUSE THAT'S PERCEIVED IN A 
CERTAIN WAY HE DOESN'T WANT 
EITHER. 
SO EVEN THOUGH HE IS COUCHING 
HIS WORDS VERY CAREFULLY, IN 
SAYING HE BELIEVES THAT THEY 
ARE PROBABLY FALSE, HE ALSO 
SAID HE'S WILLING TO LISTEN AND 
HE MIGHT BE EVEN PERSUADE TODAY 
CHANGE HIS MIND. 
-- PERSUADED TO CHANGE HIS 
MIND. 
HE COULD BE PERSUADED AND HE 
WILL BE WATCHING THIS HEARING 
VERY CAREFULLY. 
BECAUSE WHO KNOWS HE SAYS, 
PERHAPS DR. FORD WILL SAY 
SOMETHING INTERESTING. 
AND YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT 
PERFORMANCE. 
BANKRUPT WE KNOW -- PRESIDENT 
TRUMP WE KNOW REALLY VALUES 
SOMETHING'S CHARACTER BASED ON 
THEIR PERFORMANCE. 
NOT ALWAYS THE SUBSTANCE OF 
WHAT THEY CAN DELIVER. 
BUT HOW THEY PERFORM UNDER 
PRESSURE. 
ESPECIALLY ON TELEVISION. 
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT HE DOES 
ALL DAY AT THE WHITE HOUSE. 
HE WATCHES A LOT OF TV. 
AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN SOME OF 
HIS AIDES PERFORM WELL THEY GET 
A PHONE CALL SAYING SO MUCH AND 
CONGRATULATIONS YOU DID A GREAT 
JOB. 
THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE TOO. 
THAT WHEN HE BELIEVES SOMEONE 
IS ON SCREEN AND NOT 
REPRESENTING HIM AND HIS 
ADMINISTRATION IN THIS CASE HIS 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, THE WAY 
HE WANTS IT TO HAPPEN, HE 
DOESN'T HESITATE TO SAY YOU 
COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. 
YOU DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB. 
SO THAT'S I THINK WHAT HE'S 
GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR AND OF 
COURSE WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH 
CRITICISM AGAINST KAVANAUGH FOR 
HIS FOX NEWS INTERVIEW. 
IN WHICH HE WAS VERY ROBOTIC. 
AND YOU KNOW, HE SEEMED TO JUST 
HAVE A FEW LINES OF MESSAGING 
THAT HE REPEATED OVER AND OVER 
AND OVER. 
REGARDLESS OF THE QUESTION. 
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
CAREFULLY WATCH KAVANAUGH TO 
SEE WHETHER HE'S ABLE TO PAINT 
A VERY SINCERE PICTURE AND BE 
MORE CREDIBLE THAN DR. FORD. 
>> WELL, YOUR PERSISTENCE IN 
QUESTIONING THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES WAS IN THE 
VERY BEST TRADITIONS OF CBS 
NEWS GOING BACK 75 YEARS. 
AND YOU GOT THE ANSWER TO THE 
QUESTION THAT ACTUALLY MADE 
NEWS. 
SO WE APPRECIATE YOUR 
REPORTING. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> Reporter: THANK YOU. 
>>> WELL, TODAY'S HEARING IS 
DRAWING STRONG PARALLELS TO 
ANOTHER HIGH-PROFILE TESTIMONY. 
IN 1991, ANITA HILL A PROFESSOR 
WHO HAD WORKED WITH THE SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEE CLARENCE THOMAS 
HARASSMENT. 
>> HILL TESTIFIED IN FRONT OF 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
ABOUT HER CLAIMS. 
NOW 27 YEARS LATER, CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD'S ALLEGATION 
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH BRING 
HER TO THAT SAME BUILDING TO BE 
QUESTIONED BY SOME OF THE SAME 
SENATORS SO LET'S BRING IN 
JESSICA LEVINSON A PROFESSOR AT 
LOYOLA HIGH SCHOOL IN LOS 
ANGELES. 
LISTEN ONE OF THE MAIN 
DIFFERENTS WITH THE HILL 
HEARING AND TODAY -- 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE HILL 
HEARING AND TODAY'S HEARING IS 
THAT IT'S HAPPENING IN THE WAKE 
OF THE #METOO MOVEMENT. 
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT WILL 
IMPACT OR HELP OR HURT DR. 
FORD? 
>> I THINK IT'S HELPED C. FORD 
IN THIS SENSE THAT -- DR. FORD 
IN THE SENSE THAT THE SENATORS 
UNDERSTAND THEY HAVE TO DO 
SOMETHING AND I THINK THE 
INCLINATION FOR MANY OF THE 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN THE WAKE 
OF THE ACCUSATIONS IS THAT THEY 
DIDN'T WANT TO DO SOMETHING. 
THEY WANTED TO HAVE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMED. 
THEY SPECIFICALLY WANTED TO 
AVOID WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. 
WHICH IS WALL TO WALL HEADLINES 
OF SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND THE WORDS "SEXUAL 
ASSAULT." 
SO CLOSE TO THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS. 
THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THEY 
WANTED. 
AND SO THE #METOO MOVEMENT YOU 
THINK HAS REALLY FORCED THE 
REPUBLICANS' HANDS IN ASKING 
THEM TO AT LEAST GIVE A 
HEARING. 
BUT IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT 
DEEPER, THE #METOO MOVEMENT 
CLEARLY DOES HAVE ITS LIMITS 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A HEARING 
THAT'S NOT SET UP IN ANY WAY AS 
A TRUE FACT FINDING MISSION. 
AND WE HAVE HEARING THAT IS 
PITTED STRUCTURALLY DESIGNED, 
SO THAT IT'S HE SAID, SHE SAID. 
WHEN IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO 
BE THAT WAY. 
SO WE ALSO SEE IN THE COMMENTS 
OF MANY OF THE SENATORS A 
DISCONNECT BETWEEN ME TOO AND 
OUR REPRESENTATIVES. 
>> IT'S A GOOD POINT JESSICA. 
AND WHEN ANITA HILL TESTIFIED 
IN 1991, I WANT TO PLAY A 
LITTLE BIT OF WHAT SHE SAID HAD 
BEEN HER CLAIMS. 
>> I GUESS -- ABOUT HER CLAIMS. 
>> I GUESS ONE REALLY DOES HAVE 
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT 
THE NATURE OF SEXUAL 
HARASSMENT. 
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE 
TO COME FORWARD WITH THESE 
THINGS. 
>> SO NOW THREE WOMEN HAVE GONE 
THROUGH WHAT DR. HILL CALLED 
THE DIFFICULTY AND SHE MENTIONS 
WITH THEIR CLAIMS OF ASSAULT 
AGAINST JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
AND WE JUST LEARNED THAT HE WAS 
QUESTIONED ABOUT TWO OTHER 
ALLEGATIONS AS WELL. 
OBVIOUSLY THE NUMBER OF 
ACCUSATIONS AGAINST-AND-A-HALF 
IS A MAY -- KAVANAUGH IS A 
MAJOR DIFFERENCE WITH TODAY'S 
HEAR ASKING THE ONE IN 199 -- 
HEARING AND THE ONE IN 1991. 
DO YOU THINK IF OTHER WOMEN HAD 
MADE THE PUBLIC CLAIM AGAINST 
CLARENCE THOMAS TESTIMONY. 
IT WOULD HAVE GONE THE SAME 
WAY? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
I THINK WE HAVE TO REMEMBER 
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF KEY 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
CLARENCE THOMAS SITUATION AND 
THE JUDGE KAVANAUGH SITUATION. 
SO FOR INSTANCE, WITH CLARENCE 
THOMAS, WHAT WE'RE TALKING 
ABOUT IS YOU HEARD ANITA HILL 
SAY, WAS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 
NOT SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TREAT 
THOSE DIFFERENTLY. 
WE WERE ALSO TALKING ABOUT 
ADULTS WHICH CHANGES THE 
CALCULUS IN BOTH WAYS AND ON 
ONE HAND WE DON'T HAVE AS 
VULNERABLE VICTIM. 
ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE 
SOMEONE WHO WE'RE NOT TALKING 
ABOUT A 17-YEAR-OLD. 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THE CASE 
OF JUSTICE THOMAS, AN ADULT IN 
THE MIDDLE OF HIS CAREER. 
WHO'S ACCUSED OF THESE 
PARTICULAR CRIMES. 
SO THE MORE PEOPLE HAD COME 
FORWARD, WOULD IT HAVE MADE A 
DIFFERENCE FOR THE CLARENCE 
THOMAS CONFIRMATION? 
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE. 
IN THIS CASE, WHEN WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, AGAIN THE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE FOR EITHER 
UNDERAGE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT WHICH IS A LOT MORE 
SERIOUS THAN SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
OR FOR ACCUSATIONS THAT 
HAPPENED IN EARLY ADULTHOOD AND 
I WOULD THEY ONE ACCUSATION WAS 
BAD. 
TWO ACCUSATIONS WAS MUCH WORSE. 
IT WAS MUCH WORSE THAN DOUBLY 
WORSE. 
AND NOW THREE ACCUSATIONS IS 
EXPONENTIALLY WORSE BECAUSE THE 
ACCUSATIONS GO TO THE HEART OF 
HIS DEFENSE. 
WHICH IS THERE'S NOTHING IN MY 
CHARACTER THAT WOULD ALLOW ME 
TO DO THIS. 
I AM A CHOIR BOY. 
I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL. 
I WANTED TO GET GOOD FRIDAY AND 
I WANTED TO PLAY -- GRADES AND 
I WANTED TO PLAY BASKETBALL AND 
THAT WAS IT. 
I WAS NEVER CAMABLE OF THIS. 
THE -- CAPABLE OF THIS. 
ACCUSATIONS GO TO THE HEART OF 
THIS. 
>> ONE MORE SIMILARITY BETWEEN 
THOMAS HEARING AND TODAY IS 
THAT WITH CLARENCE THOMAS, 
THERE WERE OTHER PEOPLE WILLING 
TO COME FORWARD. 
THREE OTHER WITNESSES WILLING 
TO COME GO WARD. 
THE COMMITTEE DID NOT WANT TO 
HEAR FROM THEM JUST LIKE 
THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO HEAR 
FROM OTHER WITNESSES TODAY. 
JESSICA THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>>> WELL, COMING UP ON CBSN 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE CAPITOL 
RIGHT NOW WHERE VERY SOON, 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD WILL TESTIFY. 
LAWMAKERS ARE STARTING TO MAKE 
THEIR WAY IN. 
WE KNOW THAT SHE IS ALSO IN THE 
BUILDING. 
AND NOW ALSO PROTESTORS HAVE 
GATHERED OUTSIDE. 
>>> WE ARE JUST MOMENT ACE WAY 
FROM A HISTORIC -- MOMENTS AWAY 
FROM A HISTORIC HEARING THAT 
COULD INFLUENCE THE BALANCE OF 
POWER IN THE UNITED STATES FOR 
DECADES TO COME AND THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS ACCUSER 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WILL 
TESTIFY BEFORE THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
>> CBS NEWS MOLA LENGHI IS ON 
ú 
TESTIMONIES ARE SET TO BEGIN 
SHORTLY. 
GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT ARE YOU 
SEEING THERE? 
>> Reporter: HIGH STAKES 
SHOWDOWN AS YOU MENTIONENED THE 
HILL TODAY. 
THIS ENTIRE PROCESS HAS REALLY 
FALLEN ALONG PARTY LINES 
INCLUDING THE ALLEGATIONS AS 
WELL AS WHO LAWMAKERS SEEM TO 
BELIEVE. 
TODAY RACHEL MITCHELL. 
SHE WILL DO THE QUESTIONING AND 
REALLY BE THE FACE OF THE 
REPUBLICANS DURING THIS HEARING 
TODAY. 
ASKING MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE 
QUESTIONS ON THE GOP BEHALF. 
DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER HAND, 
THEY'LL DO MOST OF THEIR 
QUESTIONING OR THEY WILL DO 
THEIR QUESTIONING ON THEIR OWN. 
MITCHELL AS WE KNOW IS A CAREER 
PROSECUTOR. 
DECADES OF EXPERIENCE 
PROSECUTING SEXUAL CRIMES. 
IN MARICOPA COUNTY. 
ARIZONA, SHE IS NO STRANGER TO 
ACCUSATIONS LIKE THESE. 
TO CRIMES LIKE THESE. 
SO AS WE KNOW THESE ARE VERY 
SERIOUS AM GRACES AND -- 
ALLEGATIONS AND REPUBLICANS 
WALKING ON VERY SENSITIVE 
GROUND HERE. 
SO IN TERMS OF THE OPTICS IN 
TERMS OF LOOKING THROUGH THE 
GOP POLITICAL LENS, WHO ASKS 
THE QUESTIONS MATTERS HERE. 
AND IT APPEARS THAT THE 11 
REPUBLICAN MEN SITTING ON THIS 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WOULD 
PREFER A FEMALE TO -- TO PURSUE 
THE FORMAL QUESTIONING OF DR. 
FORD. 
OF COURSE WE CAN EXPECT DR. 
FORD TO RELAY HER SIDE OF THE 
STORY. 
BUT YOU KNOW, WE DON'T KNOW 
MUCH ABOUT DR. FORD YOU KNOW. 
-- THIS IS HER FIRST PUBLIC 
EXPERIENCE AND THERE ARE -- 
APPEARANCE AND THERE ARE STILL 
A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 
OBVIOUSLY WE KNOW WHAT TO 
EXPECT FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO 
STAND HIS GROUND AND DENY THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
HE HAS CALLED IT A SMEAR 
CAMPAIGN. 
AND THE JUDGE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DEFEND HIMSELF. 
AND BE ADAMANT ABOUT THE 
DENIALS AND YOU KNOW HE'S LAID 
OUT A VERY DIFFERENT PICTURE 
THAN HIS ACCUSERS HAVE IN TERMS 
OF WHO HE WAS AND WHAT HE WAS 
AS A YOUNG MAN. 
YOU KNOW HE SAYS HE WAS MORE OF 
A CHURCH GOING BOY SCOUT CHOIR 
BOY-TYPE. 
WHEREAS HIS ACCUSERS HAVE 
PAINTED HIM AS YOU KNOW A HARD 
PARTYING, DRINKING, FRAT BOY. 
SEXUAL PREDATOR IN MANY WAYS. 
VERY SERIOUS GAILS AND A VERY 
-- ALLEGATIONS AND A VERY STARK 
CONTRAST IN THE WAY THE TWO 
IMAGES HAVE BEEN DEPICTED. 
IF ANYTHING THAT IS SAID TODAY, 
ANYTHING THAT IS LEARNED TODAY, 
WILL IMPACT TOMORROW'S EXPECTED 
VOTE. 
BUT CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY, CHUCK 
GRASSLEY, OF THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, HE INSISTS THAT A 
VOTE WILL HAPPEN ON KAVANAUGH'S 
CONFIRMATION TODAY. 
>> ALL RIGHT MOLA LENGHI 
REPORTING FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
WE JUST SAW A PICTURE THERE OR 
AN IMAGE OF RACHEL MITCHELL WHO 
IS NOW SEATED IN THE SENATE 
CONFIRMATION HEARING ROOM. 
ABOUT TO START JUST IN ABOUT 
SIX MINUTES. 
>> YEP. 
SO YESTERDAY, NEW ACCUSATION OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AGAINST BRETT 
KAVANAUGH SHOOK WASHINGTON. 
AS A THIRD ACCUSER JULIE 
SWETNICK CAME FORWARD. 
IN A STATEMENT POSTED ON 
TWITTER SHE SAID SHE WITNESSED 
THE FUTURE SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE AT HIGH SCHOOL PARTIES 
WHERE HE ENGAGED IN SEXUALLY 
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. 
AND THAT KAVANAUGH WAS PRESENT 
AT A PARTY WHERE SHE WAS 
ALLEGEDLY DRUGGED AND GANG 
RAPED. 
>> JOINING US ON SET TO TALK 
ABOUT THE LATEST ALLEGATIONS IS 
CBSN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR -- 
NOW POLITICAL REPORTER FOR CBS 
NEWS CAITLIN HUEY BURNS AND 
ALSO FROM WASHINGTON IS WHITE 
HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR Mc
CLATCHIE. 
>> CIRCUMSTANCES BROUGHT IT OUT 
THAT WAY. 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED 
A LONG TIME AGO. 
AND IT'S NOT THAT I JUST ABOUT 
IT. 
IT'S -- THOUGHT ABOUT IT. 
IT'S BEEN ON MY MIDNIGHT -- 
MIND EVER SINCE THE 
OCCURRENCES. 
AS FAR AS IT GOES BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS GOING FOR A SEAT 
WHERE HE'S GOING TO HAVE THAT 
SEAT ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR 
THE REST OF HIS LIFE. 
AND IF HE'S GOING TO HAVE THAT 
SEAT LEGITIMATELY, ALL THE 
THINGS SHOULD BE EVACUATED. 
>> ALL RIGHT -- INVESTIGATED. 
>> ALL RIGHT SO CAITLIN BEFORE 
WE GO TO ANITA, IN LISTENING TO 
THAT MOMENT TO THAT SOUNDBYTE, 
IT DID STRIKE ME THAT IT'S A 
BRIEF CLIP. 
BUT SHE DID SOUND PARTISAN. 
THESE ALLEGATIONS MAY BE TRUE, 
BUT I THINK FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE 
THEY'RE GOING TO LISTEN TO THAT 
AND THEY'RE GOING TO SAY WELL 
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE AN 
APOGEAN DA. 
YOU HAVE -- AGENDA. 
YOU HAVE WORKED IN GOVERNMENT 
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, YOU WHO 
LEFT THE WASHINGTON BUBBLE AND 
SHE WENT FAR AWAY. 
SHE SAYS IN PART BECAUSE OF 
THIS. 
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO ACCORDING 
TO THE SWORN AFFIDAVIT HAS 
SPENT YEARS IN THE GOVERNMENT. 
SO PRESUMABLY SHE WOULD HAVE 
TRACKED BRETT KAVANAUGH'S 
CAREER ASK HIS RISE IN 
WASHINGTON JURISPRUDENCE. 
DID YOU GET THE SAME TAKE? 
>> IT ALREADY HAS BEEN AND 
ESPECIALLY SINCE MICHAEL AVENUE 
IN THE TEE IS HER ATTORNEY -- 
AVENATTI IS HER ATTORNEY HERE. 
BECAUSE HE IS POTENTIALLY A 
2020 PRESIDENTIAL CONTUNDER. 
HE'S BEEN MAKING THE STOPS TO 
THE EARLY STATES AND BEEN 
INVOLVING HIMSELF IN THE 
POLITICAL CIRCUS TO BORROW FROM 
THE TITLE OF THAT CLIP THERE. 
BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF IT TOO IS 
THAT THIS IS A PERSON WHO KNOWS 
THE PENALTY FOR PRESENTING THIS 
INFORMATION IN A SWORN LEGAL 
DOCUMENT. 
KNOWS WHAT THE PENALTY FOR 
PERJURY WOULD BE IN THAT CASE. 
GIVEN HER CIRCUMSTANCE AND HER 
HISTORY. 
NOW WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING 
TO ME IS AND THE BIGGEST 
QUESTION I HAVE HEADING INTO 
THERE SPECIFIC HEARING WHICH IS 
ABOUT FORD AND KAVANAUGH, IS 
HOW PERSUADABLE IS THE AMERICAN 
PUBLIC? 
AND HOW PERSUADABLE ARE THE 
MEMBERS OF THE U.S. SENATE? 
AND REALLY INTERESTING POLL 
FROM NPR THAT CAME OUT 
YESTERDAY SAYS LOT OF PEOPLE 
HAVE REALLY MADE UP THEIR MINDS 
ABOUT THIS. 
9% OF REPUBLICAN -- 59% OF 
REPUBLICANS SAYING THEY BELIEVE 
KAVANAUGH AND 50% OF DEMOCRATS 
SAYING THEY BELIEVE FORD AND 
WHAT REALLY STUCK OUT TO ME IS 
A # 4% OF REPUBLICAN -- 54% OF 
REPUBLICANS SAY EVEN IF THE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE, THEY 
STILL THINK HE COULD BE 
CONFIRMED. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT 
WE ARE JUST SIX WEEKS AWAY FROM 
THE MID TEMPLE ELECTION AND 
POLITICS IS HOVERING OVER ALL 
OF THIS. 
>> YOU WERE AT THE PRESIDENT'S 
PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY. 
ANITA, HE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THE 
ALLEGATION BUT HE DID TALK 
ABOUT THE WOMEN SPECIFICALLY 
BUT SORT OF THE CLOUD AT THE 
ALLEGATIONS HAVE SORT OF 
PRESENTED ON THIS CONFIRMATION 
HEARING. 
JUST TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE 
SAID. 
>> I ONLY TELL YOU THIS, THIS 
IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY 
PEOPLE THAT I HAVE EVER MET. 
AND EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS HIM 
SAYS THE SAME THING. 
AND THESE ARE ALL FALSE TO ME. 
THESE ARE FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND 
CERTAIN CASES AND CERTAIN CASES 
EVEN THE MEDIA AGREES WITH 
THAT. 
>> ALL RIGHT SO EARLIER IN THE 
WEEK, OR EARLIER WE HEARD HIM 
SAY YOU GOT TO LET HER TALK. 
CLEARLY BY YESTERDAY, THE 
PRESIDENT WAS YOU KNOW, CLEARLY 
INDICATING THAT HE DIDN'T 
BELIEVE WHAT THE WOMEN HAD TO 
SAY. 
CERTAINLY WHAT BLASEY FORD HAS 
TO SAY. 
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE 
ON WHAT THE PRESIDENT HOW HE 
PRESENTED HIMSELF? 
>> SUREMENT I MEAN, HE'S -- THE 
PRESIDENT HAS SLOWLY CHANGED 
OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS RIGHT? 
HE WAS VERY RESERVED. 
THE FIRST FEW DAYS AND HIS 
ADVISORS WERE TELLING HIM TO 
KIND OF STAY OUT OF THINGS AND 
LET IT PROCEED ON THE HILL. 
LET SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL 
SORT OF TAKE THE LEAD AND JUST 
SORT OF STAY OUT. 
BUT AS SOON AS HE LEFT 
WASHINGTON, AND HIT THE ROAD 
FOR A POLITICAL SWING THROUGH 
LAS VEGAS AND MISSOURI, YOU SAW 
THAT HIS TUNE CHANGED RIGHT? 
HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HOW HE 
REALLY FELT LIKE THIS NEEDED TO 
HURRY UP. 
THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE DR. 
FORD OR AT LEAST WAS SKEPTICAL 
ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID. 
AND THEN WE'VE SEEN HIM SORT OF 
ESCALATE OVER THE LAST FEW 
DAYS. 
HE'S PRETTY ANGRY AT HOW LONG 
THIS HAS TAKING -- MISS TAKING 
AND YOU -- THIS IS TAKING AND 
YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT 
YESTERDAY THAT THE SENATE IS 
TAKING TOO LONG. 
THEY SHOULD HAVE HUDRIED UP AND 
HAD THE -- HURRIED UP AND HAD 
THE HEARING AND HURRY UP AND 
VOTE. 
WHAT -- YOU KNOW CAITLIN 
MENTIONED THIS EARLIER, WHAT'S 
REALLY HANGING OVER HIM IS THAT 
HE NEEDS TO GET THIS DONE. 
THE SUPREME COURT NEW TERM 
STARTS ON MONDAY. 
HE HAS NOT LIKELY TO HAVE A 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE CONFIRMED 
BY MONDAY. 
SO YOU KNOW, THAT'S A PROMISE 
THAT HE SAID HE WOULD MAKE TO 
PUT A CONSERVATIVE ON THE 
COURT. 
A VERY IMPORTANT POSITION. 
THIS NINTH SEAT. 
AND ALSO YOU KNOW THE MIDTERMS 
ARE JUST WEEKS AWAY HERE. 
IF 
>>> IT'S WEIGHING ON HIM 
HEAVILY. 
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPACT 
ON THE MIDTERMS AS THIS HEARING 
HAS UNFOLDED. 
BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT A 
REALLY GOOD POINT. 
IT CERTAINLY SEEMS LIKE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE ALREADY 
DECIDED WHERE THEY STAND ON 
THIS, AND PRESUMABLY DEMOCRATS 
HAVE, AS WELL. 
SENATORS ARE WATCHING THE 
TESTIMONY AND LISTENING TO THE 
TESTIMONY FOR ONE THING BUT 
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE EVERYONE 
ELSE WILL BE OBSERVING? 
>> WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER 
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 
THAT WE ARE SEEING FORD IN 
PERSON. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IMAGES 
FROM THE HEARING ROOM, LOOK HOW 
INTIMATE IT IS. 
WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO COME IN 
FRONT OF CAMERAS, EVEN THOUGH 
THERE ARE ONLY THREE CAMERAS, 
TO COME IN FRONT OF THEM, ONE 
OF THE MOST POWERFUL COMMITTEES 
IN THE SENATE AND ALSO TO HAVE 
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE 
COUNTRY EITHER WATCHING LIVE OR 
SEEING THESE IMAGES AND HER 
ACTUAL TESTIMONY DISSEMINATED 
ACROSS IN BYTES AND THEY WILL 
SEE IT. 
EVEN IF SHE JUST REPEATS WHAT 
SHE HAS TOLD THE WASHINGTON 
POST OR WHAT WE SAW IN HER 
TESTIMONY THAT HASN'T BEEN 
RELEASED ALREADY, HER PREPARED 
REMARKS, THAT IMAGE AND PUTTING 
THESE ALLEGATIONS TO A FACE AND 
TO A PERSON, COULD BE PERSUASIVE
AMONG SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN 
WAITING TO HEAR FROM HER. 
REPUBLICANS, HOWEVER, THEY FEEL 
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT, 
FROM STRATEGIST AND OPERATIVES 
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO ON THE 
CAMPAIGN FRONT, THEY FEEL IF 
THEY DON'T GET KAVANAUGH 
CONFIRM NOW OR QUICKLY, THERE 
WILL BE A BACKLASH AGAINST 
REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERM 
ELECTIONS AND THAT THEIR OWN 
VOTERS WILL FEEL LIKE 
REPUBLICANS DIDN'T DO ENOUGH TO 
STAND UP FOR THIS NOMINEE AND 
BECAUSE AS ANITA SAID, THIS IS 
THE SUPREME COURT, BUT THIS IS 
A PIVOTAL SEAT THAT COULD 
CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF THE 
SUPREME COURT FOR A GENERATION 
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS 
REALLY ON TOP OF MIND AMONG 
THESE. 
>> LET'S RESET ON TOP OF THE 
HOUR. 
YOU SEE WITH THE CAMERA IS 
POSITIONED TO VIEW RIGHT NOW. 
DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS 
SET TO APPEAR BEFORE THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND ALMOST 
ALL THE SENATORS ARE ALREADY IN 
THE COMMITTEE BRIEFING ROOM AND 
SHE IS SET TO TESTIFY AGAINST 
HER ACCUSATION THAT JUDGE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, TRUMP'S SUPREME COURT
NOMINEE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER 
AND YOU SEE HER SEATED THERE 
RIGHT NOW. 
JUST BEFORE WE WATCH THIS 
HEARING TAKE PLACE, I WANT TO 
LET THE VIEWERS KNOW THAT I'M 
SURE THIS TESTIMONY, FOR WOMEN 
AND PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED SEXUAL 
ASSAULT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT 
TO WATCH. 
YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL THE NATIONAL
SEXUAL ASSAULT HOTLINE, THEY ARE
OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY IN THE 
NUMBER IS 1-800 -- 1-800-656-
4673 AS WE PREPARE TO WATCH DR. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WITH HER 
OPENING CEREMONY. 
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND LET'S SEE 
IF WE CAN LISTEN IN. 
SHE IS CLEARLY GETTING READY TO 
BEGIN HER TESTIMONY AND I SEE 
CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY IS ALREADY IN 
THE ROOM AND WILL GAVEL IN 
SHORTLY. 
>> MUCH HAS BEEN MADE OF 
COMPARING THIS TO THE ANITA 
HILL TESTIMONY. 
MUCH HAS BEEN MADE ABOUT HOW 
LITTLE HAS CHANGED IN 27 YEARS. 
ANITA HILL DID AN OP-ED, 
BASICALLY SAYING THAT IN THE 
CASE OF HER TESTIMONY. 
CLARENCE THOMAS TESTIFIED 
BEFORE HER AND AFTER HER AND 
SHE WAS STUCK IN THE MIDDLE. 
IN A WAY, THIS IS SOMEWHAT 
SIMILAR. 
WE'VE HEARD FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, HE HAD TWO DAYS OF 
HEARINGS AND WAS GRILLED ABOUT 
SOME SORT OF ACCUSATIONS AND WE 
DIDN'T KNOW THE DETAILS AT THE 
TIME. 
KAMALA HARRIS BROUGHT UP 
SOMETHING THAT LEFT US 
SCRATCHING OUR HEADS AMIN FOUND 
OUT LATER. 
HE WILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK AFTER 
HER AND MUCH IN A SIMILAR WAY. 
IT CERTAINLY DOES SEEM LIKE THE 
SENATE COMMITTEE HAS NOT 
DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO HANDLE 
THESE SORTS OF ALLEGATIONS. 
LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>>> THE NOMINATION OF JUDGE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH TO SERVE AS 
ASSOCIATE JUSTICE ON OUR 
SUPREME COURT AND WE WILL HEAR 
FROM TWO WITNESSES, DR. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORWARD AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THANKS, OF COURSE, TO DR. FORD 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH FOR 
ACCEPTING OUR COMMITTEE'S 
INVITATION TO TESTIFY AND ALSO 
THANKING THEM TO VOLUNTEER 
BEFORE HE TESTIFIED BEFORE WE 
EVEN INVITED THEM. 
BOTH DR. FORD AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAVE BEEN THROUGH A 
TERRIBLE COUPLE OF WEEKS. 
THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE 
RECEIVED VIOLENT THREATS. 
WHAT THEY HAVE ENDURED OUGHT TO 
BE CONSIDERED BY ALL OF US AS 
UNACCEPTABLE AND A POOR 
REFLECTION ON THE STATE OF 
CIVILITY IN OUR DEMOCRACY. 
SO, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU 
BOTH FOR THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN 
TREATED AND I INTEND, 
HOPEFULLY, FOR TODAY'S HEARING 
TO BE SAFE, COMFORTABLE AND 
DIGNIFIED FOR BOTH OF OUR 
WITNESSES. 
I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN 
ME IN THIS EFFORT OF A SHOW OF 
CIVILITY. 
WITH THAT SAID, I LAMENT THAT 
THIS HEARING -- HOW THIS 
HEARING HAS COME ABOUT. 
ON JULY 9, 2018, THE PRESIDENT 
ANNOUNCED JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION TO SERVE ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS SERVED ON 
THE MOST IMPORTANT FEDERAL 
APPELLATE COURT FOR 12 YEARS. 
BEFORE THAT, HE HELD SOME OF 
THE MOST SENSITIVE POSITIONS IN 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
THE PRESIDENT ADDED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TO A SHORT LIST OF 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES MORE 
THAN NINE MONTHS AGO. 
IT WAS NOVEMBER, 2017 AND AS 
PART OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME 
COURT, THE FBI CONDUCTED ITS 
SIXTH FULL-FIELD BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH
SINCE 1993, 25 YEARS AGO. 
NOWHERE IN ANY OF THESE SIX FBI 
REPORTS, WHICH COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATORS HAVE REVIEWED ON 
A BIPARTISAN BASIS, WAS THERE A 
WHIFF OF ANY ISSUE -- ANY ISSUE 
AT ALL -- RELATED IN ANY WAY TO 
INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL BEHAVIOR. 
DR. FORD FIRST RAISED HER 
ALLEGATIONS IN A SECRET LETTER 
TO THE RANKING MEMBER NEARLY 
TWO MONTHS AGO, IN JULY. 
THIS LETTER WAS SECRET FROM 
JULY 30, SEPTEMBER 13 2 -- NO 
-- JULY 30 UNTIL SEPTEMBER 13 
WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT IT. 
THE RANKING MEMBER TOOK NO 
ACTION. 
THE LETTER WASN'T SHARED WITH 
ME OUR COLLEAGUES OR MY STAFF. 
THESE ALLEGATIONS COULD HAVE 
BEEN INVESTIGATED IN A WAY THAT 
MAINTAINED THE CONFIDENTIALITY 
THAT DR. FORD REQUESTED. 
BEFORE HIS HEARING, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH MET PRIVATELY WITH 65 
SENATORS, INCLUDING THE RANKING 
MEMBER. 
THE RANKING MEMBER DIDN'T ASK 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ABOUT THE 
ALLEGATIONS WHEN SHE MET WITH 
HIM PRIVATELY IN AUGUST. THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HELD 
ITS 4-DAY PUBLIC HEARING FROM 
SEPTEMBER 4 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 
7. JUDGE KAVANAUGH TESTIFIED FOR
MORE THAN 32 HOURS IN PUBLIC. 
WE HELD A CLOSED SESSION FOR 
MEMBERS TO ASK SENSITIVE 
QUESTIONS ON THE LAST EVENING, 
WHICH THE RANKING MEMBER DID 
NOT ATTEND. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH ANSWERED NEARLY 
1300 WRITTEN QUESTIONS 
SUBMITTED BY SENATORS AFTER THE 
HEARING. 
IT'S MORE THAN ALL PRIOR 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. 
THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD, HE DID 
NOT KNOW ABOUT THE RANKING 
MEMBER'S SECRET EVIDENCE. 
THEN, ONLY AT AN 11TH HOUR ON 
THE EVE OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
CONFIRMATION VOTE, DID THE 
RANKING MEMBER REFER THE 
ALLEGATIONS TO THE FBI. 
THEN, SADLY, THE ALLEGATIONS 
WERE LEAKED TO THE PRESS AND 
THAT'S WHERE DR. FORD WAS 
MISTREATED. 
THIS IS A SHAMEFUL WAY TO TREAT 
OUR WITNESS WHO INSISTED ON 
CONFIDENTIALITY. 
AND, OF COURSE, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, WHO HAS HAD TO 
ADDRESS THESE ALLEGATIONS IN 
THE MIDST OF A MEDIA CIRCUS. 
WHEN I RECEIVED DR. FORD'S 
LETTER ON SEPTEMBER 13, MY 
STAFF AND I RECOGNIZED THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF THESE 
ALLEGATIONS AND IMMEDIATELY 
BEGAN OUR COMMITTEE'S 
INVESTIGATION CONSISTENT WITH 
THE WAY THE COMMITTEE HAS 
HANDLED SUCH ALLEGATIONS IN THE 
PAST. 
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE REFUSED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN WHAT SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN A BIPARTISAN 
INVESTIGATION. 
AS FAR AS I KNOW ON ALL OF THE 
JUDGESHIPS THROUGHOUT AT LEAST 
THE LAST THREE YEARS, THAT HAS 
BEEN THE WAY IT'S BEEN HANDLED. 
AFTER DR. FORD'S IDENTITY 
BECAME PBLIC, MY STAFF 
CONTACTED ALL THE INDIVIDUALS 
SHE SAID ATTENDED THE 1982 
PARTY DESCRIBED IN THE 
WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IMMEDIATELY 
SUBMITTED TO AN INTERVIEW UNDER 
PENALTY OF FELONY FOR ANY 
KNOWINGLY FALSE STATEMENTS. 
HE DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS 
CATEGORICALLY AND DEMOCRATIC 
STAFF WAS INVITED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN COULD HAVE ASKED 
ANY QUESTIONS THEY WANTED TO. 
THEY DECLINED. 
THAT LEADS ME, THEN, TO WONDER 
IF THEY ARE REALLY CONCERNED 
WITH GOING TO THE TRUTH, WHY 
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO TALK TO 
THE ACCUSED? 
THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURE IS 
WHAT THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS DOES 
WHEN WE RECEIVE ALLEGATIONS OF 
WRONGDOING. 
MY STAFF REACHED OUT TO OTHER 
INDIVIDUALS ALLEGEDLY AT THE 
PARTY, MARK JUDGE, PATRICK 
SMYTH, LELAND KAISER -- ALL 
THREE SUBMITTED STATEMENTS TO 
THE SENATE UNDER PENALTY OF 
FELONY, DENYING ANY KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED BY DR. 
FORD. 
DR. FORD'S LIFELONG FRIEND, MS. 
KAISER STATED SHE DOESN'T KNOW 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND DOESN'T 
RECALL EVER ATTENDING A PARTY 
WITH HIM. 
MY STAFF MADE REPEATED REQUESTS 
TO INTERVIEW DR. FORD DURING THE
PAST 11 DAYS, EVEN VOLUNTEERING 
TO FLY TO CALIFORNIA TO TAKE 
HER TESTIMONY. 
HER ATTORNEYS REFUSED TO 
PRESENT HER ALLEGATIONS TO 
CONGRESS. 
, NEVERTHELESS, HONORED HER 
REQUEST FOR PUBLIC HEARING'S 
AND DR. FORD, TODAY, HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT -- 
PRESENT HER ALLEGATIONS UNDER 
OATH. 
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT 
THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS INTO 
ALLEGATIONS -- THOROUGHLY 
INVESTIGATE THE ALLEGATIONS. 
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES, 
CONSISTENT WITH STATED DESIRES 
TO OBSTRUCT KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION BY ANY MEANS 
NECESSARY, PUSHED FOR FBI 
INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO FORCE 
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCY TO 
CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INTO A 
MATTER IT CONSIDERS TO BE 
CLOSED. 
MOREOVER, ONCE THE ALLEGATIONS 
BECAME PUBLIC, IT WAS EASY TO 
IDENTIFY ALL THE ALLEGED 
WITNESSES AND CONDUCT OUR OWN 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE PUBLIC HAS 
BEEN LED TO BELIEVE, THE FBI 
DOESN'T PERFORM ANY CREDIBILITY 
ASSESSMENTS OR VERIFY THE TRUTH 
OF ANY EVENTS IN THESE 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. 
I WILL QUOTE JOE BIDEN DURING 
CLARENCE THOMAS' HEARING. 
THIS IS WHAT SENATOR BIDEN'S 
AND, QUOTE, THE NEXT PERSON WHO 
REFERS TO AN FBI REPORT AS 
BEING WORTH ANYTHING, OBVIOUSLY 
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. 
THE FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT, IN 
THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE, REACH A 
CONCLUSION, PERIOD. 
THEY SAY HE SAID, SHE SAID, THEY
SAID, PERIOD. 
SO, WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE THE FBI 
REPORT BEFORE YOU, UNDERSTAND 
THEY DO NOT -- THEY DO NOT -- 
THEY DO NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS. 
THEY DO NOT MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS
, AND OF SENATOR BIDEN'S QUOTE. 
THE FBI PROVIDED US WITH THE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
NOW, IT'S UP TO THE SENATE TO 
ASSESS THEIR CREDIBILITY. 
THAT BRINGS US TO THIS VERY 
TIME. I 
LOOK FORWARD TO A FAIR AND 
RESPECTFUL HEARING AND THAT'S 
WHAT WE'VE PROMISED DR. FORD. 
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE 
COMPLAINED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
AN EXPERT ON THIS SIDE IS 
INVESTIGATING SEX CRIMES AND 
WILL BE QUESTIONING THE 
WITNESS. I 
SEE NO BASIS FOR COMPLAINT, 
OTHER THAN JUST PLAIN POLITICS. 
THE TESTIMONY WE WILL HEAR 
TODAY CONCERNS ALLEGATIONS OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT, VERY SERIOUS 
ALLEGATIONS. 
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX 
AND SENSITIVE SUBJECT TO 
DISCUSS AND IT'S NOT AN EASY 
ONE TO DISCUSS. 
THAT IS WHY THE SENATORS ON 
THIS SIDE BELIEVE AN EXPERT WHO 
HAS DEEP EXPERIENCE AND 
TRAINING IN INTERVIEWING 
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND 
INVESTIGATING SEXUAL ASSAULT 
LED ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 
ASKING QUESTIONS. 
THIS WILL BE A STARK CONTRAST 
TO THE GRANDSTANDING AND CHAOS 
THAT WE SAW FROM THE OTHER SIDE 
DURING THE PREVIOUS FOUR DAYS 
IN THIS HEARING PROCESS. 
I CAN THINK OF NO ONE BETTER 
EQUIPPED TO QUESTION THE 
WITNESSES THAN RACHEL MITCHELL. 
MS. MITCHELL IS A CAREER 
PROSECUTOR, CIVIL SERVANT WITH 
DECADES OF EXPERIENCE 
INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING 
SEX CRIMES. 
SHE HAS DEDICATED HER CAREER TO 
SEEKING JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF
SEX-RELATED FELONIES. 
MOST RECENTLY, RACHEL WAS THE 
DIVISION CHIEF OF THE SPECIAL 
VICTIMS DIVISION, MARICOPA 
COUNTY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH 
PROSECUTES SEX CRIMES AND 
FAMILY VIOLENCE. 
THEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, JANET 
NAPOLITANO, PREVIOUSLY 
RECOGNIZED HER AS THE 
OUTSTANDING ARIZONA SEXUAL 
ASSAULT PROSECUTOR OF THE YEAR. 
SHE HAS SPENT YEARS INSTRUCTING 
PROSECUTORS, DETECTIVES AND 
CHILD PROTECTION WORKERS ON HOW 
TO PROPERLY INTERVIEW VICTIMS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT AND ABUSE. 
WITH HER AGE, I LOOK FORWARD TO 
A FAIR AND PRODUCTIVE HEARING. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE TWO 
OTHER PUBLIC ALLEGATIONS. 
TODAY'S HEARING WAS SCHEDULED, 
IN CLOSE CONSULTATION WITH DR. 
FORD'S ATTORNEYS, HER TESTIMONY 
WAY WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF THIS 
HEARING. 
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO 
INVESTIGATE OTHER ALLEGATIONS. 
AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE NOT HAD 
COOPERATION FROM ATTORNEYS 
REPRESENTING OTHER CLIENTS. 
THEY HAVE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO 
SUBSTANTIATE THEIR CLAIMS. 
MY STAFF HAS TRIED TO SECURE 
TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE FROM 
ATTORNEYS FOR BOTH DEBORAH 
RAMIREZ AND JULIE SWETNICK. 
MY STAFF MADE EIGHT REQUESTS. 
YES, EIGHT REQUESTS FOR 
EVIDENCE FROM ATTORNEYS FOR MS. 
RAMIREZ AND SIX REQUESTS FOR 
EVIDENCE FOR ATTORNEYS FOR MS. 
SWETNICK. 
NEITHER ATTORNEY HAS MADE THEIR 
CLIENTS AVAILABLE FOR 
INTERVIEW. 
THE COMMITTEE CAN'T DO AN 
INVESTIGATION IF ATTORNEYS ARE 
STONEWALLING. 
I HOPE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THAT 
WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SEEK 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, AS WE 
DO A LOT OF TIMES WHEN THERE 
ARE HOLES IN WHAT WE CALL THE 
VI REPORTS. 
ADDITIONALLY, ALL THE WITNESSES 
SHOULD KNOW -- WHEN I SAY ALL 
THE WITNESSES, I MEAN DR. FORD 
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH -- ALL THE 
WITNESSES SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY 
HAVE THE RIGHT UNDER SENATE 
RULE 26.5, TO ASK THAT THE 
COMMITTEE GO INTO CLOSED 
SESSION IF THE QUESTION 
REQUIRES AN ANSWER THAT IS A 
CLEAR INVASION OF THEIR RIGHT 
TO PRIVACY. 
IF EITHER DR. FORD OR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH FEEL THAT SENATE RULE 
26.5 OUGHT TO BE INVOLVED, THEY 
SHOULD SIMPLY SAY SO. 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN? 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. 
CHAIRMAN. 
I WILL MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT ON 
YOUR REFERENCES TO ME. 
YES, I DID RECEIVE A LETTER 
FROM DR. FORD. 
IT WAS CONVEYED TO ME BY A 
MEMBER OF CONGRESS, CONGRESSMAN 
JIM -- ANNA ESHOO. 
SHE REITERATED SHE WANTED THIS 
CONFIDENTIAL AND I HELD IT 
CONFIDENTIAL, UP TO A POINT 
WHERE THE WITNESS WAS WILLING 
TO COME FORWARD. 
I THINK AS I MAKE MY REMARKS, 
YOU WILL PERHAPS SEE WHY. 
BECAUSE HOW WOMEN ARE TREATED 
IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THIS 
KIND OF CONCERN, IT'S REALLY 
WANTING A LOT OF REFORM AND I 
WILL GET TO THAT FOR A MINUTE. 
IN THE MEANTIME, GOOD MORNING, 
DR. FORD AND THANK YOU FOR 
COMING FORWARD AND BEING 
WILLING TO SHARE YOUR STORY WITH
US. 
I KNOW THIS WAS NOT EASY FOR 
YOU. 
BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR 
TESTIMONY AND THE CHAIRMAN CHOSE
NOT TO DO THIS, I THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE 
PROPERLY INTRODUCED. 
>> I WAS GOING TO INTRODUCE 
HER. 
IF YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE HER, I 
WILL BE GLAD TO HAVE YOU DO 
THAT. I 
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I DIDN'T 
FORGET TO DO IT. 
I WAS ABOUT TO DO IT BEFORE SHE 
SPOKE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I SAW YOUR 
CV, I WAS EXTREMELY IMPRESSED. 
YOU HAVE A BACHELORS DEGREE 
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH 
CAROLINA, CHAPEL HILL, TWO 
MASTERS DEGREES. 
ONE FROM STANFORD AND ONE FROM 
PEPPERDINE AND A PhD FROM THE 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA, BETTER KNOWN TO 
SENATOR HARRIS AND I ASKED USC. 
YOU ARE A PROFESSOR AFFILIATED 
WITH BOTH STANFORD UNIVERSITY 
AND PALO ALTO UNIVERSITY. 
YOU HAVE PUBLISHED OVER 65 PEER-
REVIEWED ARTICLES AND HAVE 
RECEIVED NUMEROUS AWARDS FOR 
YOUR WORK AND RESEARCH. 
AS IF THAT WERE NOT ENOUGH, YOU 
ARE A WIFE, A MOTHER OF TWO SONS
AND A CONSTITUENT FROM 
CALIFORNIA. 
SO, I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU 
FOR YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR 
BRAVERY IN COMING FORWARD. 
I KNOW IT'S HARD. 
BUT, BEFORE I TURN IT OVER, I 
WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT 
WHAT IS TO BE DISCUSSED TODAY 
AND WHERE WE ARE, AS A COUNTRY. 
SEXUAL VIOLENCE IS A SERIOUS 
PROBLEM AND ONE THAT LARGELY 
GOES UNSEEN. 
IN THE UNITED STATES, IT'S 
ESTIMATED BY THE CENTERS FOR 
DISEASE CONTROL THAT ONE IN 
THREE WOMEN AND ONE IN SIX MEN 
WILL EXPERIENCE SOME FORM OF 
SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN THEIR 
LIFETIME. 
ACCORDING TO THE RAPE, ABUSE 
AND INCEST NATIONAL NETWORK, 
60% OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS GO 
UNREPORTED. 
IN ADDITION, WHEN SURVIVORS TO 
REPORT THEIR ASSAULTS, IT'S 
OFTEN YEARS LATER, DUE TO THE 
TRAUMA THEY SUFFERED AND FEARING
THEIR STORIES WILL NOT BE 
BELIEVED. 
LAST WEEK, I RECEIV A LETTER 
FROM A 60-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIA 
CONSTITUENT WHO TOLD ME THAT 
SHE SURVIVED AN ATTEMPTED RAPE 
AT AGE 17 AND DESCRIBED IT AS 
BEING TERRIFYING AND 
EMBARRASSING. 
SHE NEVER TOLD ANYONE UNTIL 
MUCH LATER IN LIFE. 
THE ASSAULT STAYED WITH HER FOR 
43 YEARS. I 
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
REMEMBER THESE REALITIES AS WE 
HEAR FROM DR. FORD ABOUT HER 
EXPERIENCE. 
THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF 
PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THE 
#METOO MOVEMENT TODAY VERSUS 
THE YEAR OF THE WOMAN ALMOST 27 
YEARS AGO. 
BUT, WHILE YOUNG WOMEN ARE 
STANDING UP AND SAYING, NO 
MORE, OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT 
PROGRESSED AND HOW THEY TREAT 
WOMEN WHO COME FORWARD. 
TOO OFTEN, WOMEN'S MEMORIES AND 
CREDIBILITY COME UNDER ASSAULT. 
IN ESSENCE, THEY ARE PUT ON 
TRIAL AND FORCED TO DEFEND 
THEMSELVES. 
OFTEN, THEY ARE REVICTIMIZED IN 
THE PROCESS. 
27 YEARS AGO, I WAS WALKING 
THROUGH AN AIRPORT WHEN I SAW A 
LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE GATHERED 
AROUND A TV TO LISTEN TO ANITA 
HILL TELL HER STORY. 
ONE I SAW WAS AN ATTRACTIVE 
WOMAN IN A BLUE SUIT BEFORE AN 
ALL-MALE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
SPEAKING OF HER EXPERIENCE OF 
SEXUAL HARASSMENT. 
SHE WAS TREATED BADLY, ACCUSED 
OF LYING, ATTACKED AND HER 
CREDIBILITY PUT TO THE TEST 
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. 
TODAY, DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD HAS COME FORWARD TO TELL 
HER STORY OF BEING ASSAULTED 
AND FEARING FOR HER LIFE WHEN 
SHE WAS A TEENAGER. 
INITIALLY, AS I SAID, DR. FORD 
DR. FORD DID NOT WANT TO MAKE 
HER PUBLIC -- STORY PUBLIC. 
REPUBLICANS SCHEDULED THE 
HEARING WITHOUT TALKING HER OR 
EVEN INVITING HER TO TESTIFY. 
SHE WAS TOLD SHE HAD TO SHOW UP 
OR THE COMMITTEE WOULD MOVE 
FORWARD WITH A VOTE. 
IT TOOK A PUBLIC OUTCRY FROM 
THE MAJORITY -- EXCUSE ME -- 
FOR THE MAJORITY TO BACK DOWN 
AND GIVE HER EVEN A FEW DAYS TO 
COME BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. 
REPUBLICANS ALSO SCHEDULED THIS 
HEARING WITH DR. FORD WITHOUT 
HAVING HER ALLEGATIONS 
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI. 
IN 1991, ANITA HILL'S 
ALLEGATIONS WERE REVIEWED BY 
THE FBI, AS IS THE NORMAL 
PROCESS AND SQUARELY WITHIN ITS 
JURISDICTION. 
HOWEVER, DESPITE REPEATED 
REQUESTS, PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE REFUSED TO 
TAKE THIS ROUTINE STEP AND 
DIRECT THE FBI TO CONDUCT AN 
IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATION. 
THIS WOULD CLEARLY BE THE BEST 
WAY TO ENSURE A FAIR PROCESS TO 
BOTH JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND TO DR. 
FORD. 
IN 1991, THE SENATE HEARD FROM 
22 WITNESSES OVER THREE DAYS. 
TODAY, WHILE REJECTING AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION, REPUBLICANS ARE 
REFUSING TO HEAR TESTIMONY FROM 
ANY OTHER WITNESS, INCLUDING 
MARK JUDGE, WHO DR. FORD 
IDENTIFIED AS BEING IN THE ROOM 
WHEN THE ATTACK TOOK PLACE. 
WE BELIEVE MARK JUDGE SHOULD BE 
SUBPOENAED SO THE COMMITTEE CAN 
HEAR FROM HIM DIRECTLY. 
REPUBLICANS HAVE ALSO REFUSED 
TO CALL ANYONE WHO COULD SPEAK 
TO THE EVIDENCE THAT WOULD 
SUPPORT OR REFUTE DR. FORD'S 
CLAIM. NOT ONE WITNESS WHO 
COULD ADDRESS CREDIBILITY AND 
CHARACTER OF EITHER FORD OR 
KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN CALLED. 
WHAT I FIND MOST INEXCUSABLE IS 
THE RUSH TO JUDGMENT AND 
UNWILLINGNESS TO TAKE THESE 
KINDS OF ALLEGATIONS AT FACE 
VALUE AND LOOK AT THEM FOR WHAT 
THEY ARE, A REAL QUESTION OF 
CHARACTER FOR SOMEONE WHO IS 
ASKING FOR A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
IN 1991, REPUBLICANS BELITTLED 
PROFESSOR HILLS EXPERIENCE 
SAYING, AND I QUOTE, IT WON'T 
MAKE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN THE 
OUTCOME. THE BURDEN OF PROOF 
WAS ON PROFESSOR HILL. 
TODAY, OUR REPUBLICAN 
COLLEAGUES ARE SAYING IT'S A 
HICCUP AND DR. FORD IS MIXED UP 
AND DECLARING I WILL LISTEN TO 
THE LADY, BUT WE WILL BRING 
THIS TO A CLOSE. 
WHAT'S WORSE, MANY OF OUR 
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE AISLE HAVE ALSO MADE IT 
CLEAR THAT NO MATTER WHAT 
HAPPENS TODAY, THE SENATE WILL 
PLOW RIGHT THROUGH AND ENSURE 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WOULD BE 
ELEVATED WITHIN A WEEK. 
IN FACT, ON TUESDAY, THE 
MAJORITY WENT AHEAD AND 
SCHEDULED A VOTE ON THE 
NOMINATION BEFORE WE HEARD ONE 
WORD OF TESTIMONY REGARDING 
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AND MISCONDUCT BY BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP EVEN TOLD 
SENATORS THEY SHOULD PLAN TO BE 
IN OVER THIS WEEKEND SO THE 
NOMINATION CAN BE PUSHED 
THROUGH WITHOUT DELAY. 
THIS IS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT 
IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, TWO MORE 
WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD WITH 
THEIR OWN SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT INVOLVING 
BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
THIS PAST SUNDAY, WE'VE LEARNED 
ABOUT DEBBIE RAMIREZ, WHO WAS A 
STUDENT AT YALE WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
SHE, TOO, DID NOT WANT TO COME 
FORWARD BUT AFTER BEING 
APPROACHED BY REPORTERS, SHE 
TOLD HER STORY. 
SHE WAS AT A COLLEGE PARTY 
WHERE KAVANAUGH EXPOSED HIMSELF 
TO HER. 
SHE RECALLS PUSHING HIM AWAY 
AND THEN SEEING HIM LAUGHING 
AND PULLING HIS PANTS UP. 
YESTERDAY, JUDY'S -- JULIE 
SWETNICK CAME FORWARD TO SAY 
SHE HAD EXPERIENCES OF BEING AT 
HOUSE PARTIES WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE. 
SHE RECOUNTED SEEING KAVANAUGH 
ENGAGE -- AND I QUOTE -- AND 
ABUSIVE AND PHYSICALLY 
AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR TOWARD GIRLS
. IT INCLUDED ATTEMPTS TO, 
QUOTE, REMOVE OR SHIFT GIRL'S 
CLOTHING. 
NOT TAKING NO FOR AN ANSWER, 
GRABBING GIRLS, QUOTE, WITHOUT 
THERE CONTENT -- CONSENT AND 
TARGETING PARTICULAR GIRLS SO 
THEY COULD BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE 
OF. 
EACH OF THESE STORIES ARE 
TROUBLING ON THEIR OWN AND EACH 
OF THESE ALLEGATIONS SHOULD BE 
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI. 
ALL THREE WOMEN HAVE SAID THEY 
WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO 
INVESTIGATE, PLEASE DO SO. 
ALL THREE HAVE SAID THEY HAVE 
OTHER WITNESSES AND EVIDENCE TO 
CORROBORATE THEIR ACCOUNTS. 
YET, REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO 
BLINDLY PUSH FORWARD. 
SO, TODAY, WE ARE MOVING 
FORWARD WITH A HEARING AND 
BEING ASKED TO ASSESS THE 
CREDIBILITY OF BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
HE'S MADE SEVERAL STATEMENTS 
ABOUT HOW HIS FOCUS WAS ON 
SCHOOL, BASKETBALL, SERVICE 
PROJECTS AND GOING TO CHURCH. 
HE DECLARED THAT HE, QUOTE, 
NEVER DRANK SO MUCH HE COULDN'T 
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED AND HE 
HAS, QUOTE, ALWAYS TREATED 
WOMEN WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. 
WHILE HE HAS MADE THESE 
DECLARATIONS, MORE AND MORE 
PEOPLE HAVE COME FORWARD TO 
CHALLENGE HIS CHARACTERIZATION 
OF EVENTS AND BEHAVIORS. 
JAMES ROCHE, HIS FRESHMAN 
ROOMMATE AT YALE STATED 
KAVANAUGH WAS, AND I QUOTE 
AGAIN, FREQUENTLY INCOHERENTLY 
DRUNK. 
THAT WAS WHEN, QUOTE, HE BECAME 
AGGRESSIVE AND BELLIGERENT. 
A FRIEND OF HIS FROM YALE SAID, 
AND I QUOTE, THERE'S NO MEDICAL 
WAY I CAN SAY THAT HE WAS 
BLACKED OUT. 
IT'S NOT CREDIBLE FOR HIM TO 
SAY THAT HE HAS NO MEMORY 
LAPSES IN THE NIGHTS THAT HE 
DRANK TO EXCESS. LYNN BROOKS, A 
COLLEGE CLASSMATE SAID THE 
PICTURE KAVANAUGH IS TRYING TO 
PAINT DOESN'T MATCH HER MEMORIES
OF HIM. 
AND I QUOTE, HE IS TRYING TO 
PAINT HIMSELF AS SOME KIND OF 
CHOIR BOY. 
YOU CAN'T LIE YOUR WAY ONTO THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
WITH THAT STATEMENT OUT HE'S 
GONE TOO FAR. 
IT'S ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE 
INSTITUTION, AND QUOTE. 
ULTIMATELY, MEMBERS AND LADIES 
AND GENTLEMEN, I REALLY THINK 
THAT'S THE POINT. 
WE ARE HERE TO DECIDE WHETHER TO
EVALUATE THIS NOMINEE TO THE 
MOST PRESTIGIOUS COURT IN OUR 
COUNTRY, AND IT'S ABOUT THE 
INTEGRITY OF THAT INSTITUTION 
AND THE INTEGRITY OF THIS 
INSTITUTION. 
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS WATCHING 
HOW WE HANDLE THESE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
I HOPE THE MAJORITY CHANGES 
THEIR TACTICS, OPENS THEIR MIND 
AND SERIOUSLY REFLECTS ON WHY 
WE ARE HERE. 
WE ARE HERE FOR ONE REASON, TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SHOULD BE ELEVATED TO 
ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL 
POSITIONS IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS 
IS NOT A TRIAL OF DR. FORD, 
IT'S A JOB INTERVIEW FOR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
IS BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO WE WANT 
ON THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS COURT 
IN OUR COUNTRY? 
IS SEE THE BEST WE CAN DO? 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> I'M SORRY YOU BROUGHT UP 
ABOUT THE UNSUBSTANTIATED 
ALLEGATIONS OF OTHER PEOPLE 
BECAUSE WE ARE HERE FOR THE 
SOLE PURPOSE OF LISTENING TO 
DR. FORD AND WILL CONSIDER 
OTHER ISSUES AT OTHER TIMES. 
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU RISE 
ú 
NOW, DO YOU SWEAR THAT THE 
TESTIMONY YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE 
THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND 
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH, SO HELP 
YOU GOD? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
PLEASE BE SEATED AND BEFORE YOU 
GIVE YOUR STATEMENT, I WANT TO 
SAY THAT -- TO EVERYBODY -- 
THAT SHE HAS ASKED THAT ANY 
TIME YOU ASK FOR A BREAK, YOU 
GET A BREAK. 
ANYTIME THERE'S SOMETHING THAT 
YOU NEED THAT YOU DON'T HAVE, 
JUST ASK US. 
YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH TIME FOR 
YOUR OPENING STATEMENT AS YOU 
WANT. 
JUST, GENERALLY, LET US KNOW IF 
THERE'S ANY ISSUES. 
PROCEED, PLEASE. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR GRASSLEY. 
I THINK AFTER I READ MY OPENING 
STATEMENT I ANTICIPATE NEEDING 
SOME CAFFEINE IF THAT IS 
AVAILABLE. 
>> OKAY. 
CAN YOU PULL THE MICROPHONE A 
LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO YOU, 
PLEASE? 
>> OKAY. 
>> CAN THE WHOLE BOX GO A 
LITTLE BIT CLOSER? 
>> I'M TRYING, SENATOR. 
>> I WILL LEAN FORWARD. 
>> THANK YOU. 
IS THIS GOOD? 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY. 
THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY 
AND RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN, 
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. 
MY NAME IS CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD. 
I'M A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY 
AT PALO ALTO UNIVERSITY AND I'M 
A RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST AT THE 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF 
MEDICINE. 
I WILL DETAIL MY EDUCATIONAL 
BACKGROUND SINCE IT HAS ALREADY 
BEEN SUMMARIZED. 
I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO RUSSELL 
FORD SINCE 2002 AND WE HAVE TWO 
CHILDREN. 
I'M HERE TODAY NOT BECAUSE I 
WANT TO BE. 
I AM TERRIFIED. 
I AM HERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT 
IS MY CIVIC DUTY TO TELL YOU 
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHILE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND I WERE IN HIGH 
SCHOOL SCHOOL. 
I'VE DESCRIBED THE EVENTS 
PUBLICLY BEFORE. 
I'VE SUMMARIZED THEM IN MY 
LETTER TO RANKING MEMBER 
FEINSTEIN AND AGAIN IN THE 
LETTER TO CHAIRMAN GRASSLEY. 
I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE 
IMPORTANCE OF YOU HEARING FROM 
YOU DIRECTLY ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED TO ME AND THE IMPACT 
IT HAS HAD ON MY LIFE AND ON MY 
FAMILY. 
I GREW UP IN THE SUBURBS OF 
WASHINGTON, D.C. AND I ATTENDED 
THE HOLTON ARMS SCHOOL IN 
BETHESDA, MARYLAND, FROM 1978 
THROUGH 1984. 
HOLTON ARMS IS AN ALL GIRL 
SCHOOL BUILT IN 1901 AND DURING 
THE TIME AT THE SCHOOL, GIRLS 
AT HOLTON ARMS FREQUENTLY MET 
AND BECAME FRIENDLY WITH BOYS 
FROM ALL BOY SCHOOLS IN THE 
AREA INCLUDING GEORGETOWN PREP, 
GONZAGA HIGH SCHOOL AS WELL AS 
COUNTRY CLUBS AND OTHER PLACES 
WHERE KIDS AND FAMILIES 
SOCIALIZED. 
THIS IS HOW I MET BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, THE BOY WHO SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED ME. 
DURING MY FRESHMAN AND 
SOPHOMORE SCHOOL YEARS WHEN I 
WAS 14 AND 15 YEARS OLD, MY 
GROUP OF FRIENDS INTERSECTED 
WITH BRETT AND HIS FRIENDS FOR 
A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. 
I HAD BEEN FRIENDLY WITH A 
CLASSMATE OF BRETT'S FOR A 
SHORT TIME DURING MY FRESHMAN 
AND SOPHOMORE YEAR AND IT WAS 
THROUGH THAT CONNECTION THAT I 
ATTENDED A NUMBER OF PARTIES 
THAT BRETT ALSO ATTENDED. 
WE DID NOT KNOW EACH OTHER WELL 
BUT I KNEW HIM AND HE KNEW ME. 
IN THE SUMMER OF 1982, MOST 
SUMMERS, I SPENT MOST EVERY DAY 
AT THE COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB IN 
CHEVY CHASE, MARYLAND, SWIMMING 
AND PRACTICING DIVING. 
ONE EVENING THAT SUMMER, AFTER 
A DAY OF DIVING AT THE CLUB, I 
ATTENDED A SMALL GATHERING AT A 
HOUSE IN THE BETHESDA AREA. 
THERE WERE FOUR BOYS I REMEMBER 
SPECIFICALLY BEING AT THE 
HOUSE. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, MARK JUDGE, A 
BOY NAMED PJ AND ONE OTHER BOY 
WHOSE NAME I CANNOT RECALL. 
I ALSO REMEMBER MY FRIEND LELAND
ATTENDING. 
I DO NOT REMEMBER ALL OF THE 
DETAILS OF HOW THAT GATHERING 
CAME TOGETHER. 
TOGETHER. 
LIKE MANY THAT SUMMER, IT WAS 
ALMOST SURELY A SPUR OF THE 
MOMENT GATHERING. 
I TRULY WISH I COULD BE MORE 
HELPFUL WITH MORE DETAILED 
ANSWERS TO ALL OF THE QUESTIONS 
THAT HAVE AND WILL BE ASKED 
ABOUT HOW I GOT TO THE PARTY 
AND WHERE IT TOOK PLACE AND SO 
FORTH. I 
DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS AND 
I DON'T REMEMBER AS MUCH AS I 
WOULD LIKE TO. 
BUT, THE DETAILS ABOUT THAT 
NIGHT THAT BRING ME HERE TODAY 
ARE THE ONES I WILL NEVER 
FORGET. 
THEY HAVE BEEN SEARED INTO MY 
MEMORY AND HAVE BEEN HARD TO 
BEAT EPISODICALLY AS AN ADULT. 
WHEN I GOT TO THE SMALL 
GATHERING, PEOPLE WERE DRINKING 
BEER AND A SMALL LIVING 
ROOM/FAMILY ROOM AREA ON THE 
FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. 
I DRANK ONE BEER. BRETT AND 
MARK WERE VISIBLY DRUNK. 
EARLY IN THE EVENING, I WENT UP 
A VERY NARROW SET OF STAIRS 
LEADING FROM THE LIVING ROOM TO 
A SECOND FLOOR TO USE THE 
RESTROOM. 
WHEN I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE 
STAIRS, I WAS PUSHED FROM 
BEHIND INTO A BEDROOM ACROSS 
FROM THE BATHROOM. 
I COULDN'T SEE WHO PUSHED ME. 
BRETT AND MARK CAME INTO THE 
BEDROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR 
BEHIND THEM. 
THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING IN THE 
BEDROOM. 
IT WAS TURNED UP LOUD OR BY 
EITHER BRETT OR MARK ONCE WE 
WERE IN THE ROOM. 
I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED AND 
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME. 
HE BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER 
MY BODY AND GRINDING INTO ME. I 
YELLED, HOPING THAT SOMEONE 
DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME AND I 
TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM BUT 
HIS WEIGHT WAS HEAVY. 
BRETT GROPED ME AND TRIED TO 
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. HE HAD A 
HARD TIME BECAUSE HE WAS VERY 
INEBRIATED AND BECAUSE I WAS 
WEARING A 1-PIECE BATHING SUIT 
UNDERNEATH MY CLOTHING. 
I BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO RAPE 
ME. 
I TRIED TO YELL FOR HELP. 
WHEN I DID, BRETT PUT HIS HAND 
OVER MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM 
YELLING. 
THIS IS WHAT TERRIFIED ME THE 
MOST AND HAS HAD THE LASTING 
IMPACT ON MY LIFE. 
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE 
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME. 
BOTH BRETT AND MARK WERE 
DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE 
ATTACK. 
THEY SEEMED TO BE HAVING A VERY 
GOOD TIME. 
MARK SEEMED AMBIVALENT AT 
TIMES, URGING BRETT ON AND AT 
TIMES, TELLING HIM TO STOP. 
A COUPLE OF TIMES, I MADE EYE 
CONTACT WITH MARK AND THOUGHT 
HE MIGHT TRY TO HELP ME. 
BUT, HE DID NOT. 
DURING THIS ASSAULT, MARK CAME 
OVER AND JUMPED ON THE BED 
TWICE WHILE BRETT WAS ON TOP OF 
ME. 
THE LAST TIME THAT HE DID THIS, 
WE TOPPLED OVER AND BRETT WAS 
NO LONGER ON TOP OF ME. 
I WAS ABLE TO GET UP AND RUN 
OUT OF THE ROOM. 
I WENT DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM THE 
BEDROOM TO THE SMALL BATHROOM 
AND I RAN INSIDE THE BATHROOM 
AND LOCKED THE DOOR. 
I WAITED UNTIL I HEARD BRETT 
AND MARK LEAVE THE BEDROOM 
LAUGHING AND LOUDLY WALKED DOWN 
THE NARROW STAIRWAY, PIN 
BOWLING OFF THE WALLS ON THE 
WAY DOWN. 
I WAITED AND WHEN I DID NOT 
HEAR THEM COME BACK UP THE 
STAIRS, I LEFT THE BATHROOM, 
WENT DOWN THE SAME STAIRWELL 
THROUGH THE LIVING ROOM AND 
LEFT THE HOUSE. 
I REMEMBERED BEING ON THE STREET
AND FEELING AN ENORMOUS SENSE 
OF RELIEF THAT I ESCAPED THAT 
HOUSE AND THAT BRETT AND MARK 
WERE NOT COMING OUTSIDE AFTER 
ME. 
BRETT'S ASSAULT ON ME 
DRASTICALLY ALTERED MY LIFE FOR 
A VERY LONG TIME. 
I WAS TOO AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO 
TELL ANYONE THESE DETAILS. 
I DID NOT WANT TO TELL MY 
PARENTS THAN I, AT AGE 15, WAS 
IN THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY 
PARENTS PRESENT DRINKING BEER 
WITH BOYS. 
I CONVINCED MYSELF THAT BECAUSE 
BRETT DID NOT RATE ME, I SHOULD 
JUST MOVE ON AND PRETEND IT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
OVER THE YEARS, I TOLD VERY, 
VERY FEW FRIENDS THAT I HAD HAD 
THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. I 
TOLD MY HUSBAND BEFORE WE WERE 
MARRIED THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED 
A SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
I HAD NEVER TOLD THE DETAILS TO 
ANYONE, THE SPECIFIC DETAILS, 
UNTIL MAY 2012 DURING A COUPLES 
COUNSELING SESSION. 
THE REASON THIS CAME UP IN 
COUNSELING WAS THAT MY HUSBAND 
AND I HAD COMPLETED A VERY 
EXTENSIVE, VERY LONG REMODEL OF 
OUR HOME AND I INSISTED ON A 
SECOND FRONT DOOR, AN IDEA THAT 
HE AND OTHERS DISAGREED WITH 
AND COULD NOT UNDERSTAND. IN 
EXPLAINING WHY, WHY I WANTED A 
SECOND FRONT DOOR, I BEGAN TO 
DESCRIBE THE ASSAULT IN DETAIL. 
I RECALLED SAYING THAT THE BOY 
WHO ASSAULTED ME COULD SOMEDAY 
BE ON THE U.S. SUPREME COURT 
AND SPOKE ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND 
AT AN ELITIST ALL BOYS SCHOOL IN
BETHESDA, MARYLAND. 
MY HUSBAND RECALLS THAT I NAMED 
MY ATTACKER AS BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
AFTER THAT MAY 2012 THERAPY 
SESSION, I DID MY BEST TO 
IGNORE THE MEMORIES OF THE 
ASSAULT BECAUSE RECOUNTING THEM 
CAUSED ME TO RELIVE THE 
EXPERIENCE AND CAUSED PANIC AND 
ANXIETY. 
OCCASIONALLY, I WOULD DISCUSS 
THE ASSAULT IN INDIVIDUAL 
THERAPY SESSIONS. 
TALKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE 
RELIVING OF THE TRAUMA SO I 
TRIED NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT OR 
DISCUSS IT. 
OVER THE YEARS, I WENT THROUGH 
PERIODS WHERE I THOUGHT ABOUT 
THE ATTACK. I HAD CONFIDED IN 
SOME CLOSE FRIENDS THAT I HAD 
AN EXPERIENCE WITH SEXUAL 
ASSAULT. 
OCCASIONALLY, I STATED THAT MY 
ASSAILANT WAS A PROMINENT 
LAWYER OR JUDGE BUT I DID NOT 
USE HIS NAME. 
I DO NOT RECALL EACH PERSON I 
SPOKE TO ABOUT BRETT'S ASSAULT. 
SOME FRIENDS HAVE REMINDED ME 
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS SINCE 
THE PUBLICATION OF THE 
WASHINGTON POST STORY ON 
SEPTEMBER 16, 2018. 
UNTIL JULY 2018, I HAD NEVER 
NAMED MR. KAVANAUGH AS THE 
ATTACKER OUTSIDE OF THERAPY. 
THIS CHANGED IN EARLY JULY 
2018. I 
SAW PRESS REPORTS STATING THAT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS ON THE 
SHORT LIST OF A LIST OF VERY 
WELL-QUALIFIED SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEES. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY CIVIC DUTY 
TO RELAY THE INFORMATION I HAD 
ABOUT MR. KAVANAUGH'S CONDUCT 
SO THAT THOSE CONSIDERING HIS 
NOMINATION WOULD KNOW ABOUT 
THIS ASSAULT. 
ON JULY 6, I HAD A SENSE OF 
URGENCY TO RELAY THE 
INFORMATION TO THE SENATE AND 
THE PRESIDENT AS SOON AS 
POSSIBLE BEFORE A NOMINEE WAS 
SELECTED. 
I DID NOT KNOW HOW, 
SPECIFICALLY, TO DO THIS. I 
CALLED MY CONGRESSIONAL 
REPRESENTATIVE AND LET HER 
RECEPTIONIST KNOW THAT SOMEONE 
ON THE PRESIDENT'S SHORTLIST 
HAD ATTACKED ME. I 
ALSO SENT A MESSAGE TO THE 
ENCRYPTED WASHINGTON POST 
CONFIDENTIAL TIP LINE. I 
DID NOT USE MY NAME, BUT I 
PROVIDED THE NAMES OF BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE. 
I STATED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD 
ASSAULTED ME IN THE 1980s IN 
MARYLAND. 
THIS WAS AN EXTREMELY HARD 
THING FOR ME TO DO. 
BUT, I FELT THAT I COULDN'T NOT 
DO IT. 
OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS, A TOLD 
A COUPLE OF CLOSE FRIENDS ON 
THE BEACH IN CALIFORNIA THAT 
MR. KAVANAUGH HAD SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED ME. 
I WAS VERY CONFLICTED AS TO 
WHETHER TO SPEAK OUT. 
ON JULY 9, I RECEIVED A RETURN 
PHONE CALL FROM THE OFFICE OF 
CONGRESSWOMAN ANNA ESHOO AFTER 
MR. KAVANAUGH HAD BECOME THE 
NOMINEE. 
I MET WITH HER STAFF ON JULY 18 
AND WITH HER ON JULY 20, 
DESCRIBING THE ASSAULT AND 
DISCUSSING FEARS OF COMING 
FORWARD. 
LATER WE DISCUSSED THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SENDING A LETTER 
TO RANKING MEMBER FEINSTEIN, 
ONE OF MY STATE SENATORS, 
DESCRIBING WHAT OCCURRED. 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT 
REPRESENTATIVE ANNA ESHOO'S 
OFFICE TO THE ZOO -- DELIVERED 
A LETTER TO MS. FEINSTEIN'S 
OFFICE. 
THE LETTER INCLUDED MY NAME AND 
A REQUEST THAT IT BE KEPT 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
MY HOPE WAS THAT PROVIDING THE 
INFORMATION CONFIDENTIALLY 
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW 
THE SENATE TO CONSIDER MR. 
KAVANAUGH'S SERIOUS MISCONDUCT 
WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE MYSELF, 
MY FAMILY OR ANYONE'S FAMILY 
VULNERABLE TO THE PERSONAL 
ATTACKS AND INVASIONS OF 
PRIVACY THAT WE HAVE FACED 
SINCE MY NAME BECAME PUBLIC. 
IN A LETTER DATED AUGUST 31, 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WROTE THAT 
SHE WOULD NOT SHARE THE LETTER 
WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT CONSENT AND 
I APPRECIATED THIS COMMITMENT. 
SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR 
THEMSELVES WHEN AND WHETHER 
THEIR PRIVATE EXPERIENCE IS 
MADE PUBLIC. 
AS THE HEARING DATE GOT CLOSER, 
I STRUGGLED WITH A TERRIBLE 
CHOICE. DO I SHARE THE FACTS 
WITH THE SENATE AND PUT MYSELF 
AND MY FAMILY AND THE PUBLIC 
SPOTLIGHT? 
OR, DO I PRESERVE MY PRIVACY 
AND ALLOW THE SENATE TO MAKE 
ITS DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING 
THE FULL TRUTH OF HIS PAST 
BEHAVIORS. 
I AGONIZED DAILY WITH THIS 
DECISION THROUGHOUT AUGUST AND 
SEPTEMBER 2018. 
THE SENSE OF DUTY THAT 
ORIGINALLY MOTIVATED ME TO 
REACH OUT CONFIDENTIALLY TO THE 
WASHINGTON POST AND TO THE 
OFFICE OF ANNA ESHOO WHEN THERE 
WAS STILL A LIST OF EXTREMELY 
QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AND TO 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, WAS ALWAYS 
THERE. 
BUT, MY FEARS OF THE 
CONSEQUENCES OF SPEAKING OUT 
STARTED TO EXPONENTIALLY 
INCREASE. 
DURING AUGUST 2018, THE PRESS 
REPORTED THAT MR. KAVANAUGH 
CONFIRMATION WAS VIRTUALLY 
CERTAIN. 
PERSONS PAINTED HIM OF A 
CHAMPIONS RIGHTS AND 
EMPOWERMENT AND I BELIEVED IF I 
GAME FORWARD, MY SINGLE VOICE 
WOULD BE DROWNED OUT BY A CHORUS
OF POWERFUL SUPPORTERS. 
BY THE TIME OF THE CONFIRMATION 
HEARINGS I HAD RESIGNED MYSELF 
TO REMAIN QUIET AND LETTING THE 
COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE MAKE 
THEIR DECISION WITHOUT KNOWING 
WHAT MR. KAVANAUGH HAD DONE TO 
ME. 
ONCE THE PRESS STARTED 
REPORTING ON THE EXISTENCE OF 
THE LETTER, THAT I HAD SENT TO 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN, I FACED 
MOUNTING PRESSURE. 
REPORTERS APPEARED AT MY HOME 
AND AT MY WORKPLACE DEMANDING 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE LETTER 
AND IN THE PRESENTS OF MY 
GRADUATE STUDENTS. 
THEY CALLED MY BOSSES AND 
COWORKERS AND LEFT ME MANY 
MESSAGES MAKING IT CLEAR THAT 
MY NAME WOULD INEVITABLY BE 
RELEASED TO THE MEDIA. I 
DECIDED TO SPEAK OUT PUBLICLY 
TO A JOURNALIST WHO ORIGINALLY 
RESPONDED TO THE TIP I HAD SENT 
TO THE WASHINGTON POST AND WHO 
HAD GAINED MY TRUST. 
IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO 
DESCRIBE THE DETAILS OF THE 
ASSAULT IN MY OWN WORDS. 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 16, THE DATE OF 
THE WASHINGTON POST STORY, I 
HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OUTPOURING 
 
STATE OF THIS COUNTRY. 
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR LIVES 
DRAMATICALLY ALTERED BY SEXUAL 
VIOLENCE HAVE REACHED OUT TO 
SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND HAVE 
THANKED ME FOR COMING FORWARD. 
WE HAVE RECEIVED TREMENDOUS 
SUPPORT FROM OUR FRIENDS IN OUR 
COMMUNITY. 
AT THE SAME TIME, MY GREATEST 
FEARS HAVE BEEN REALIZED AND 
THE REALITY HAS BEEN FAR WORSE. 
MY REALITY IS FAR WORSE THAN 
EXPECTED. 
MY FAMILY AND I ARE THE TARGET 
OF CONSTANT HARASSMENT AND 
DEATH STRENGTHS -- DEATH 
THREATS AND I'VE BEEN CALLED 
THE MOST VILE AND HATEFUL NAMES 
IMAGINABLE. 
THESE EXPRESSIONS HAVE BEEN 
TERRIFYING AND HAVE ROCKED ME 
TO MY CORE. 
PEOPLE HAVE POSTED MY PERSONAL 
INFORMATION AND THAT OF MY 
PARENTS ONLINE ON THE INTERNET. 
THIS HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL 
EMAILS, CALLS AND THREATS. 
MY FAMILY AND I WERE FORCED TO 
MOVE OUT OF OUR HOME. 
SINCE SEPTEMBER 16, MY FAMILY 
AND I HAVE BEEN VISITING IN 
VARIOUS LOCALES, AND TIME 
SEPARATED AND AT TIMES TOGETHER 
WITH THE HELP OF SECURITY 
GUARDS. 
THIS PAST TUESDAY EVENING, MY 
WORK EMAIL WAS HACKED AND 
MESSAGES WERE SENT OUT TRYING 
TO RECANT MY DESCRIPTION OF THE 
SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
APART FROM THE ASSAULT, ITSELF, 
THESE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS HAVE 
BEEN THE HARDEST OF MY LIFE. 
I'VE HAD TO RELIVE THIS TRAUMA 
IN FRONT OF THE WORLD AND I'VE 
SEEN MY LIFE PICKED APART BY 
PEOPLE IN TELEVISION, ON 
TWITTER AND OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA 
AND IN THIS BODY, WHO HAVE 
NEVER MET ME OR SPOKEN WITH ME. 
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ACTING 
OUT OF PARTISAN POLITICAL 
MOTIVES AND THOSE WHO SAY THAT 
DO NOT KNOW ME. 
I'M AN INDEPENDENT PERSON AND 
I'M NO ONE'S PAWN. 
MY MOTIVATION IN COMING FORWARD 
WAS TO BE HELPFUL AND TO 
PROVIDE FACTS ABOUT HOW MR. 
KAVANAUGH'S ACTIONS HAVE 
DAMAGED MY LIFE SO THAT YOU 
COULD TAKE INTO A SERIOUS 
CONSIDERATION, AS YOU MAKE YOUR 
DECISION ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED, 
AND IT IS NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY 
TO DETERMINE WHETHER MR. 
KAVANAUGH DESERVES TO SIT ON 
THE SUPREME COURT. MY 
RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TELL YOU 
THE TRUTH. 
I UNDERSTAND THAT A 
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR HAS 
BEEN HIRED TO ASK ME QUESTIONS 
AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING MY 
VERY BEST TO ANSWER THEM. 
I'VE NEVER BEEN QUESTIONED BY A 
PROSECUTOR AND I WILL DO MY 
BEST. 
AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE THE 
COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL BE 
JUDGING MY CREDIBILITY, I DO 
HOPE TO BE ABLE TO ENGAGE 
DIRECTLY WITH EACH OF YOU. AT 
THIS POINT, I WILL DO MY BEST 
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. 
AND, THE REQUESTS FOR CAFFEINE. 
>> A COKE OR SOMETHING? 
>> THAT SOUNDS GOOD. 
THAT WOULD BE GREAT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
BEFORE I USE MY FIVE MINUTES OF 
QUESTIONING, I THOUGHT THAT I'D 
TRY TO REMIND MY COLLEAGUES -- 
AND IN THIS CASE, MS. MITCHELL, 
AS WELL, THAT THE 5 MINUTES -- 
THE WAY I TRADITIONALLY HAVE 
DONE THIS. 
IF YOU ASK A QUESTION BEFORE 
YOUR TIME RUNS OUT AND EVEN 
THOUGH YOU GO OVER YOUR TIME, 
AS LONG AS YOU AREN'T 
FILIBUSTERING, I WILL LET YOU 
ASK YOUR QUESTION. 
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT 
BOTH DR. FORD AND DR. FORD AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH -- AS CHAIRMAN 
OF THE COMMITTEE -- I KNOW THEY 
WILL GET A CHANCE TO ANSWER THE 
QUESTIONS FULLY. 
BEYOND THE 5 MINUTES. 
BUT, WHEN EITHER DR. FORD OR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH GETS DONE, WE 
IMMEDIATELY GO TO THE NEXT 
PERSON. 
SO, I HOPE THAT WILL BE DONE. 
DR. FORD, I'M TOLD THAT YOU 
WANT A BREAK RIGHT NOW. 
IF YOU DO, THAT'S FINE. 
>> I'M OKAY. 
I GOT THE COFFEE. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
I THINK I CAN PROCEED WITH THE 
COFFEE. 
>> NOBODY CAN MIX UP MY COFFEE 
RIGHT, SO YOU ARE PRETTY 
FORTUNATE. 
NOW, WITH THAT, YOU HAVE MY 
FIVE MINUTES TO ASK QUESTIONS, 
MS. MITCHELL. 
>> GOOD MORNING, DR. FORD. 
WE HAVEN'T MET. 
MY NAME IS RACHEL MITCHELL. 
>> NICE TO MEET YOU. 
>> I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THE 
FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME FROM 
YOUR STATEMENT THIS MORNING WAS 
THAT YOU ARE TERRIFIED AND JUST 
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I'M VERY 
SORRY. 
THAT'S NOT RIGHT. I 
KNOW THIS IS STRESSFUL AND I 
WOULD LIKE TO SET FORTH SOME 
GUIDELINES THAT MAY ALLEVIATE 
THAT A LITTLE BIT. 
IF I ASK YOU A QUESTION THAT 
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, PLEASE 
ASK ME TO CLARIFY IT. 
OR, ASK IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. 
WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS, I MAY 
REFER TO OTHER INFORMATION YOU 
HAVE PROVIDED. 
IF I DO THAT AND I GET IT 
WRONG, PLEASE CORRECT ME. 
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO 
GUESS. I 
KNOW IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO. 
IF YOU DO ESTIMATE, PLEASE LET 
ME KNOW THAT YOU ARE 
ESTIMATING, OKAY? 
WE'VE PUT BEFORE YOU, AND I'M 
SURE YOU HAVE COPIES OF IT 
ANYWAY, FIVE PIECES OF 
INFORMATION AND THEY WANT TO GO 
OVER THEM. 
THE FIRST IS A SCREENSHOT OF A 
WHATSAPP TEXTING BETWEEN YOU 
AND SOMEBODY AT THE WASHINGTON 
POST. 
DO YOU HAVE THAN IN FRONT OF 
YOU? 
>> YES. 
>> THE FIRST TWO TEXT MESSAGES 
WERE SENT BY YOU ON JULY 6, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> THE LAST WAS ON JULY 10 SENT 
BY YOU? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> ARE THOSE THREE COMMENTS 
ACCURATE? 
>> I WILL READ THEM. 
>> TAKE YOUR TIME. 
>> THERE IS ONE CORRECTION. 
>> OKAY. 
>> I MISUSED THE WORD BYSTANDER 
AS AN ADJECTIVE. 
>> OKAY. 
>> BYSTANDER MEANS SOMEONE THAT 
IS LOOKING AT AN ASSAULT AND THE
PERSON NAMED PJ WAS NOT 
TECHNICALLY A BYSTANDER. I 
WAS WRITING VERY QUICKLY WITH A 
SENSE OF URGENCY. I 
WOULD NOT CALL HIM A BYSTANDER. 
HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS AND WHAT I 
REMEMBER OF HIM, HE WAS TALL AND
A VERY NICE PERSON. I 
DIDN'T KNOW HIM WELL. 
HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS, NOT ANYWHERE 
NEAR THE EVENT. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> I'D LIKE TO TAKE THAT WORD 
OUT, IF POSSIBLE. 
>> THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING 
THAT. 
THE SECOND IS THE LETTER THAT 
YOU WROTE TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN 
DATED JULY 30 OF THIS YEAR. 
DID YOU WRITE THE LETTER 
YOURSELF? 
>> I DID. 
>> SINCE IT'S DATED JULY 30, 
DID YOU WRITE IT ON THAT DATE? 
>> I BELIEVE SO. 
IT SOUNDS RIGHT. 
I WAS IN DELAWARE AT THE TIME. I
COULD LOOK INTO MY CALENDAR AND 
TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. 
>> WAS IT WRITTEN ON OR ABOUT 
THAT DATE? 
>> YES. I 
TRAVEL, I THINK, THE 26TH OF 
JULY 2 DELAWARE. 
IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I WROTE 
IT FROM THERE. 
>> IS A LETTER ACCURATE? 
>> I WILL TAKE A MINUTE TO READ 
IT. 
I CAN READ FAST. 
>> TAKE YOUR TIME. 
>> OKAY. 
>> OKAY. I 
HAVE THREE AREAS I'D LIKE TO 
ADDRESS. 
>> OKAY. 
>> IN THE SECOND PARAGRAPH, 
WHERE IT SAYS THE ASSAULT 
OCCURRED IN A SUBURBAN MARYLAND 
AREA HOME, AT A GATHERING THAT 
INCLUDED ME AND FOUR OTHERS, I 
CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT THERE 
WEREN'T A FEW OTHER PEOPLE 
THERE. 
THEY ARE NOT IN MY PURVIEW OF 
MY MEMORY. 
>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY 
THERE WERE AT LEAST FOUR 
OTHERS? 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY. 
>> WHAT IS THE SECOND 
CORRECTION? 
>> THE NEXT SENTENCE BEGINS 
WITH KAVANAUGH PHYSICALLY 
PUSHED ME INTO THE BEDROOM. 
I WOULD SAY I CAN'T PROMISE 
THAT MARK JUDGE DIDN'T ASSIST 
WITH THAT. I 
DON'T KNOW. 
I WAS PUSHED FROM BEHIND. I 
DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT FULLY ON 
HIM. 
>> OKAY. 
>> MS. MITCHELL, I DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER IT'S FAIR TO ME TO 
INTERRUPT BUT I WANT TO KEEP 
PEOPLE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES. 
IS THAT A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR YOU 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A QUESTION? 
BECAUSE, WE'VE GOT TO -- I'VE 
GOT TO TREAT EVERYBODY THE 
SAME. 
>> A UNDERSTAND THAT. 
>> CANNOT GO TO SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN? 
>> YES, SIR. 
I'M SORRY. 
PLEASE DO. 
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN? 
>> WE WILL COME BACK TO THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
>> 
. 
>>> A THOUSAND FEMALE 
PHYSICIANS CHOOSE THE COUNTRY 
THOSE ARE WHAT THE LETTERS ARE. 
I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY.       
WHY HAVE YOU HELD IT TO 
YOURSELF ALL THESE YEARS? 
ASYOU LOOK BACK  CAN YOU 
INDICATE WHAT THE REASONS ARE?  
. 
>>WELL, I DID DISCLOSE IT IN 
THE CONFINES OF THERAPY WHERE I 
FELT LIKE IT WAS AN APPROPRIATE 
PLACE TO COPE WITH THE EVENT. 
>> WELL, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT 
IMPACT THE EVENTS HAD ON YOU? 
>> WELL, I THINK IT VARIES BY 
PERSON. 
SO FOR ME PERSONALLYANXIETY, 
PHOBIA, AND PTSD-LIKE SYMPTOMS 
ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT 
I'VE BEEN COPING WITH. 
SOMORE SPECIFICALLY PANIC AND 
THAT TYPE OF THING. 
>> IS THAT THE REASON FOR THE 
SECOND DOOR, FRONT DOOR? 
>> CORRECT, CORRECT -- OUR 
HOUSE DOES NOT LOOK AS AT THE 
TIME COLLEAGUE PLEASING FROM 
THE CURB. 
>> AND DO YOU HAVE THAT SECOND 
FRONT DOOR? 
>> YES.  
IT NOW IS A PLACE TO HOST 
GOOGLE INTERNS. 
WE LIVENEAR GOOGLE SO WE GET TO 
-- OTHER STUDENTS -- 
>> CAN YOU TELL US, IS THERE 
ANY OTHER WAY THIS HAS AFFECTED 
YOUR LIFE? 
>> UM, THE  PRIMARY IMPACT WAS 
IN THE INITIAL 4 YEARS AFTER 
THE EVENT. 
UM, I STRUGGLED ACADEMICALLY, I 
STRUGGLED VERY MUCH IN CHAPEL 
HILL IN COLLEGE WHEN I WAS 17 
AND WENT OFF TO COLLEGE I HAD A 
VERY HARD TIME, UM, MORE SO 
THAN OTHERS.     
FORMING NEW FRIENDSHIPS AND 
ESPECIALLY FRIENDSHIPS WITH 
BOYS.      
AND I HAD ACADEMIC PROBLEMS  . 
>> WHAT WERE THE --  
WHEN -- WHEN WE SPOKE AND IT 
BECAME VERY CLEAR HOW DEEPLY 
YOU FELT ABOUT THIS,  AND THE 
NEED THAT YOU WANTED TO REMAIN 
CONFIDENTIAL. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT THAT?  
. 
>> YES. 
SO  I WAS WATCHING CAREFULLY 
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER  -- WELL, 
MY OR NOT INTENT I JUST WANT TO 
REMIND IS TO COMMUNICATE WITH 
EVERYONE WHEN THERE WAS STILL A 
LIST OF CANDIDATES WHO ALL 
SEEMED TO BE JUST FROM MY 
PERSPECTIVE FROM WHAT I COULD 
READ EQUALLY QUALIFIED.  
I WAS IN A HURRY TO TRY TO GET 
THE INFORMATION FORWARD BUT 
DIDN'T QUITE KNOW HOW TO DO 
THAT. 
HOWEVER, ONCEHE WAS SELECTED 
AND SEEMED LIKE HE WAS POPULAR 
AND A SURE VOTE, I WAS 
CALCULATING DAILY  THE RISK 
BENEFIT FOR ME OF COMING 
FORWARD.     
AND WONDERING WHETHER I WOULD 
JUST BE JUMPING IN FRONT OF A 
TRAIN THAT WAS HEADED TO WHERE 
IT WAS HEADED ANY WAY AND THAT 
I WOULD JUST BE PERSONALLY -- 
>> HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO COME 
FORWARD?    
. 
>> ULTIMATELY BECAUSE  
REPORTERS WERE SITTING OUTSIDE 
OF MY HOME TRYING TO TALK TO MY 
DOG THROUGH THE WINDOW, UM TO 
CALM THE DOG DOWN AND A  
REPORTER APPEARED IN MY 
GRADUATE CLASSROOM AND I 
MISTOOK HER FOR A STUDENT.    
AND SHE CAME UP TO ASK ME A 
QUESTION, AND I  THOUGHT THAT 
SHE WAS A STUDENT. 
AND IT TURNED OUTTHAT SHE WAS A 
REPORTER.     
SO AT THAT POINT I FELT LIKE 
ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH. 
PEOPLE WERE CALLING MY 
COLLEAGUES AND LEAVING MESSAGES 
ON THEIR VOICE MAILS AND EMAILS 
SAY THEY KNEW MY NAME. 
CLEARLYPEOPLE KNEW INTO ADDRESS 
BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT IN FRONT 
OF MY HOUSE AND THE MOUNTING 
PRESSURE IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS 
TIME TO JUST SAY WHAT I NEEDED 
TO SAY. 
>> I'M SORRY.    
I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION  
ABOUT THE ATTACK ITSELF.      
UM, YOU WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT 
THE ATTACK BEING PUSHED INTO 
THE ROOM, YOU SAY YOU DON'T 
KNOW QUITE BY WHOM. 
BUT THAT IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH 
THAT COVERED YOUR MOUTH TO 
PREVENT YOU FROM SCREAMING, UM, 
AND THEN YOU ESCAPED. 
HOW AREYOU SO SURE THAT IT WAS 
HE?    
. 
>> THE SAME WAY THAT I'M SURE 
THAT I'M TALKING TO YOU RIGHT 
NOW. 
JUST BASIC MEMORYFUNCTIONS AND  
ALSO  JUST THE LEVEL OF  -- IN 
THE BRAIN THAT SORT OF AS YOU 
KNOW ENCODES  THAT NERVE 
TRANSMITTERS ENCODES MEMORIES 
AND SO THE TRAUMA RELATED 
EXPERIENCE THEN IS KIND OF 
LOCKED THERE WHEREAS OTHER 
DETAILS KIND OF DRIFT. 
>> SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING US IS 
THIS COULD NOT BE A CASE OF 
MISTAKEN IDENTITY. 
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> MISS MITCHEL FOR SENATOR 
HATCH. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
UM,WHEN WE WERE STOPPED YOU 
WERE GOING TO TELL US A THIRD 
CORRECTION THAT YOU WANTED TO 
MAKE ON THAT STATEMENT.    
-- OR I'M SORRY THE LETTER TO 
SENATOR FINESTEIN. 
>> IT WASN'T A CORRECTION, BUT 
I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON IT 
SINCE WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS 
LETTER.  
UM, THAT I DID SEE MARK JUDGE 
ONCE AT THE SAFEWAY AFTER THE 
TIME OF THE ATTACK. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL WITH 
ANYONE'S RESOURCES TO FIGURE 
OUT WHEN HE WORKED THERE IF 
PEOPLE ARE WANTING MORE DETAILS 
FROM ME ABOUT WHEN THE ATTACK 
OCCURRED. 
IF WE COULD FIND OUT WHEN HE 
WORKED THERE THEN I COULD 
PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED  TIME 
LINE AS TO WHEN THE ATTACK 
OCCURRED. 
>> OKAY.    
 
NOT A CORRECTION IN YOUR 
STATEMENT. 
>> IT'S JUST -- NO. 
>> OKAY. 
YOU ALSO WROTE OUT AHANDWRITTEN 
STATEMENT  FOR THE -- WHEN YOU 
TOOK YOUR POLYGRAPH TEST THAT'S 
CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY.     
I SEE CORRECTIONS ON THAT WHERE 
YOU CROSSED OUT SO I WILL GO 
ONTO THE WASHINGTON POST  
ARTICLE THAT WAS -- 
>> OKAY. 
>> ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED ON 
SEPTEMBER 16TH OF THIS YEAR. 
>> AND SHOULD I JUST NOT LOOK 
AT THIS FOR ACCURACY OR WE'RE 
JUST GOING TO LEAVE THAT -- 
>> WE MAY COME BACK TO IT. 
>> OKAY. 
>> IF YOU NEED TO REFER TO IT. 
>> OKAY. 
>> ON THE WASHINGTON POST 
ARTICLE DID YOU SUBMIT TO AN 
INTERVIEW BY A REPORTER WITH 
THE WASHINGTON POST FOR THAT 
ARTICLE TO BE WRITTEN?   
. 
>> CORRECT. 
>> OKAY.  
. 
>> AND THEN FINALLY, WAS THE 
STATEMENT THAT YOU PROVIDED 
THIS MORNING, I ASSUME THAT TO 
THE BEST OF YOUR REX THAT THAT 
WAS ACCURATE.  
. 
>> THAT THIS WHOLE ARTICLE IS 
ACCURATE 
>> NO, NO, THE STATEMENT YOU 
MADE THIS MORNING. 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY.  
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE 
DAY THAT THIS HAPPENED LEADING 
UP TO THE GATHERING. 
>> OKAY. 
>> IN YOUR STATEMENT THIS 
MORNING, HAVE YOU TOLD US 
EVERYTHING  THAT YOU REMEMBER  
ABOUT THE DAY LEADING UP TO 
THAT? 
>> YES. 
>> LET ME ASK JUST A FEW 
QUESTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT 
YOU'VE THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING, 
OKAY?   
UM, YOU INDICATED THAT YOU WERE 
AT THE COUNTRY CLUB SWIMMING 
THAT DAY? 
>> THAT'S MY BEST ESTIMATE OF 
HOW THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED. 
>> OKAY. 
UM, AND WHEN YOU SAYBEST 
ESTIMATE, IS THAT BASED ON THE 
FACT THAT YOU SAID YOU WENT 
THERE PRETTY MUCH EVERY DAY. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> IS THAT A YES? 
>> YES 
>> OKAY. 
DO YOU RECALL PRIOR TOGETTING 
THERE -- SO I'M ONLY TALKING 
ABOUT UP TO THE GATHERING. 
>> OKAY. 
>> HAVE YOU HAD ANYTHING TO 
. 
>> NOT AT ALL. 
>> WERE YOU ON ANY SORT OF 
MEDICATION? 
>> NONE. 
>> DO YOU RECALL KNOWING BEFORE 
YOU WENT WHO WAS GOING TO BE AT 
THAT GATHERING? 
>> I RECALL  THAT EXPECTING  
THAT MARK JUDGE AND LELAND 
WOULD BE AT THAT GATHERING. 
>> DO YOU RECALL AN EXPECTATION 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH WOULD BE 
THERE? 
>> I DON'T RECALL WHETHER OR 
NOT I EXPECTED THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 
GATHERING UP FROM THE TIME YOU 
ARRIVED  UNTIL RIGHT WHEN YOU 
WENT UP THE STAIRS, JUST THAT 
PERIOD OF TIME, OKAY? 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> WHAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERE LIKE 
AT THE GATHERING?  
. 
>> UM,  MR. KAVANAUGH AND MR. 
JUDGE WERE EXTREMELY -- THEY 
HAD CLEARLY BEEN DRINKING PRIOR 
AND THE OTHER PEOPLE AT THE 
PARTY  WERE NOT.    
UM, THE LIVING ROOM -- 
>> CAN I ASK YOU TO FOLLOW-UP 
WHEN YOU SAID IT WAS CLEAR THAT 
THEY HAD BEEN DRINKING PRIOR DO 
YOU MEAN PRIOR TO THE TIME 
YOU'D GOTTEN THERE FOR PRIOR TO 
THE TIME THAT THEY HAD ARRIVED? 
>> PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT THEY 
ARRIVED. 
I DON'T RECALL WHOARRIVED FIRST 
THOUGH, WHETHER IT WAS ME OR 
THEM 
>> OKAY. 
PLEASE CONTINUE. 
>> OKAY. 
I RECALL -- I CANSKETCH A FLOOR 
PLAN. 
I RECALLTHAT IT WAS A SPARSELY 
FURNISHED FAIRLY MODEST LIVING 
ROOM AND IT WAS NOT REALLY A 
PARTY.     
LIKE THE NEWS HAS MADE IT 
SOUND.  
IT WAS NOT -- IT WAS JUST A 
GATHERING THAT  I ASSUMED WAS 
GOING TO LEAD TO A PARTY LATER 
ON THAT THOSE BOYS WOULD ATTEND 
BECAUSE THEY ATTENDED TO HAVE 
PARTIES LATER AT NIGHT THAN I 
WAS ALLOWED TO STAY OUT.  
SO IT WAS KIND OF A PRE-
GATHERING. 
>> WAS IT LOUD? 
>> NO, NOT IN THE LIVING ROOM. 
>> OKAY. 
PLAYING INTHE BEDROOM, WAS 
THERE ANY OTHER  UM, MUSIC OR 
TELEVISION OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT THAT WAS ADDING -- 
>> NO. 
>> OKAY. 
SO THERE WASN'T ASTEREO PLAYING 
DOWNSTAIRS? 
>> NO. 
>> SENATOR,    DR. FORD THANK 
YOU FOR BEING HERE.    
MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU KNOW, THE WAY 
TO MAKE THIS INQUIRY TRULY 
CREDIBLE IS TO DO WHAT WE'VE 
ALWAYS DONE WHEN NEW 
INFORMATION ABOUT A NOMINEE 
COMES TO LIGHT, TO USE YOUR 
WORDS THIS MORNING,  YOU WANT 
TO REACH THE TRUTH, THE EASY 
WAY TO DO THAT ASK THE FBI TO 
INVESTIGATE IS WHAT WE'VE 
ALWAYS DONE.     
AFTER THEY INVESTIGATE REPORT 
BACK TO US. 
THE SAME APPLIES TOTHE SERIOUS 
ALLEGATIONS MADE BY DEBRA 
RAMIREZ. 
LET'S HAVE ANON-PARTISAN 
PROFESSIONAL INVESTIGATION AND 
THEN TAKE THE TIME TO HAVE 
THESE WITNESSES  TESTIFY.      
CHAIRMAN, YOU AND I WERE BOTH 
HERE 27 YEARS AGO.  
AT THAT TIME THE SENATE FAILED 
ANITA HILL. 
I'M CONCERNED WE'RE DOINGA LOT 
LESS FOR THESE 3 WOMEN TODAY, 
THAT'S MY PERSONAL VIEW. 
DR. FORD, NO MATTER WHAT 
HAPPENS AT THIS HEARING TODAY, 
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS 
NOMINATION I KNOW AND I HEAR 
FROM SO MANY FROM MY STATE OF 
VERMONT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF 
VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OUT THERE 
WHO HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY YOUR 
COURAGE. 
I AM. 
BRAVERY IS CONTAGIOUS.
INDEED THAT'S THE DRIVING FORCE 
BEHIND THE ME TOO MOVEMENT. 
YOUSHARING YOUR STORY IS GOING 
TO HAVE A LASTING POSITIVE 
IMPACT ON SO MANY SURVIVORS IN 
OUR COUNTRY.      
WE OWE YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE 
FOR THAT, DOCTOR. 
NOW, 
MIXED UP ABOUT WHO ASSAULTED 
YOU. 
AND NOW 
PLOTMODES A WILD THEORY ABOUT A 
KAVANAUGH LOOK-ALIKE. 
YOUIMMEDIATELY REJECT THAT HAD 
THEORY.      
AS DID THE INNOCENT MAN WHO HAD 
BEEN CALLED THAT LOOKALIKE. 
ALOT OF THIS COMMITTEE 
FORCEFULLY REJECTED -- ASK 
CONSENT TO ENTER THAT INTO THE 
RECORD. 
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION. 
>> NOW, HOW DO YOU KNOW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE, IS IT 
POSSIBLE THAT YOU HAD MIXED 
THEM UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE? 
>> NO, IT IS NOT. 
AND THEPERSON THAT WAS  BLAMED 
FOR THE INCIDENT  IS ACTUALLY 
THE PERSON WHO INTRODUCED ME TO 
THEM ORIGINALLY.    
SO HE WAS A MEMBER OF COLUMBIA 
COUNTRY CLUB AND I DON'T WANT 
TO TALK ABOUT HIM BECAUSE I 
THINK IT'S UNFAIR. 
BUT HE IS THEPERSON THAT 
INTRODUCED ME TO THEM. 
>> BUT YOU  -- YOU WOULD NOT 
MIX-UP SOMEBODY ELSEWHERE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> OR MARK JUDGE? 
>> CORRECT. 
>>     WELL, THEN LET'S GO BACK 
TO THE INCIDENT. 
WHAT IS THE STRONGESTMEMORY YOU 
HAVE, STRONGEST MEMORY OF THE 
INCIDENT? 
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN NOT 
FORGET. 
TAKE WHATEVER TIME YOUNEED.     
. 
>> INDELIBLE -- IS THE 
LAUGHTER, THE LAUGHTER BETWEEN 
THE 2, AND THEIR  HAVING FUN AT 
MY EXPENSE.      
. 
>> YOU NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT 
LAUGHTER, YOU NEVER FORGOTTEN 
THEM LAUGHING AT YOU. 
>> THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH EACH 
OTHER.     
. 
>> AND YOU WERE THE OBJECT OF 
THE LAUGHTER?  
. 
>>YEAH, I WAS  
WHILE THE 2 LAUGHED.    
2 FRIENDS HAVING A REALLY GOOD 
TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER.     
. 
>> LET ME ENTER INTO THE RECORD 
A STATEMENT BY THE NATIONAL 
TASK FORCE TO END DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE WITHOUT OBJECTION SO 
ORDERED. 
>> A LETTER FROM 24 MEMBERS OF 
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
URGING  THE COMMITTEE TO USE 
THE TRAUMA -- APPROACH AND 
QUESTION DR. FORD.     
. 
>> . 
>> A LETTER FROM ANOTHER 116 
MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE ASKING TO  
DELAY UNTIL ALL THIS HAS BEEN 
HEARD. 
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION SO 
ORDERED. 
>> AND DR. FORD, HAS AT TIMES 
BEEN CRITICIZED FOR WHAT SHE 
DOESN'T REMEMBER FROM 36 YEARS 
AGO.     
BUT WE HAVE NUMEROUS EXPERTS 
INCLUDING A STUDY BY THE U.S. 
ARMY MILITARY POLICE SCHOOL OF 
BEHAVIOR SCIENCES EDUCATION 
LAPSES OF MEMORY ARE WHOLLY 
CONSISTENT WITH SEVERE TRAUMA 
AND STRESS OF ASSAULT AND I'D 
ASK THAT BE ENTERED. 
>>  WITHOUT OBJECTION SO
ORDERED. 
>> AND DR. FORD JUST CONCLUDED 
THIS, YOU DO REMEMBER WHAT 
HAPPENED, DO YOU NOT? 
>> VERY MUCH SO.   
. 
>> THANK YOU. 
THANK YOU.
. 
>> NOW, MK MITC HERBS ELL FOR 
SENATOR -- I UNDERSTAND YOU 
WANT TO TAKE A BREAK. 
>> DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU AS 
WELL? 
>> WE'RE HERE TO ACCOMMODATE 
YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> GO AHEAD.    
. 
>> THANK YOU.     
UM, YOU TOLD SENATOR FINESTEIN 
IN YOUR LETTER THAT  YOU AND 4 
OTHERS WERE PRESENT.     
YOU'VE CORRECTED THAT TODAY TO 
SAY IT WAS LEAST 4 OTHERS.    
WHEN YOU WERE INTERVIEWED BY 
THE WASHINGTON POST YOU SAID 
THAT THERE WERE 4 BOYS PRESENT 
AT THE PARTY.      
UM, AND THEN IN YOUR POLYGRAPH 
STATEMENT YOU SAY THERE WERE 4 
BOYS AND 2 GIRLS.   
WHEN YOU SAY 2 GIRLS, WAS THAT 
YOU AND ANOTHER OR WAS THAT 2 
OTHER GIRLS? 
>> THAT WAS ME AND ONE OTHER 
GIRL. 
>> AND THAT OTHER GIRL'S NAME. 
>> LEELAND. 
>> LEELAND KAISER NOW? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> SO THEN WOULD IT BE FAIR TO 
SAY LEAST P.J., BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, MARK JUDGE, LEELAND 
INGRAM AT THE TIME AND YOURSELF 
WERE PRESENT AND POSSIBLY 
OTHERS. 
>> AND ONE OTHER BOY. 
I JUSTDON'T KNOW THE NAME OF 
THE OTHER BOY. 
>>  HAVE YOU BEEN CONTACTED BY
ANYBODY SAYING HEY, I WAS AT 
THAT PARTY TOO? 
>> NO, I HAVEN'T TALKED WITH 
ANYONE FROM THAT PARTY 
>> OKAY. 
OKAY.
NOW, YOU'VE -- YOU'VE BEEN 
DETAILED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED 
ONCE YOU GOT UP THE STAIRS.  
AND SO I DON'T NEED TO GO 
THROUGH THAT AGAIN. 
I'MSORRY -- GO AHEAD. 
>> I'M SORRY. 
I JUST REALIZED ISAID SOMETHING 
THAT WAS INACCURATE. 
I SAID I HASN'TSPOKEN WITH 
ANYONE FROM THE PARTY. 
I'VE SPOKEN WITHLEELAND. 
>> THANK YOU FOR CORRECTING 
THAT. 
I APPRECIATE THAT.

HAPPENED ONCE YOU WENT UP THE 
STAIRS. 
I DON'T FEEL IT'SNECESSARY TO 
GO OVER THOSE THINGS AGAIN. 
>> OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> HAVE YOU TOLD US EVERYTHING 
THAT YOU DO REMEMBER ABOUT IT? 
>> I BELIEVE SO, BUT IF THERE 
ARE OTHER QUESTIONS I CAN 
ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THEM. 
>> OKAY. 
UM, YOU SAID THAT THEMUSIC WAS  
SOCIALLY COMING FROM THAT ROOM 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> OKAY. 
AND IT WAS TURNED UPONCE THE 3 
OF YOU WERE INSIDE THAT ROOM, 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY. 
AT SOME POINT DO YOURECALL IT 
BEING TURNED DOWN? 
>> I DON'T REMEMBE IF IT WAS 
TURNED DOWN ONCE I WAS LEAVING 
THE HOUSE. 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
>> OKAY. 
>> LIKELY SINCE I COULD HEAR 
THEM WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS 
VERY CLEARLY FROM THE BATHROOM. 
>> OKAY. 
AND THE BATHROOM DOORWAS CLOSED 
WHEN YOU HEARD THIS IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>> I COULD HEAR THEM CLEARLY 
HITTING THE WALLS GOING DOWN 
THE STAIRWELL 
>> OKAY. 
IN FACT, IN YOURLETTER YOU SAID 
THAT  THEY WENT DOWN THE STAIRS 
AND THEY WERE TALKING WITH 
OTHER PEOPLE -- 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> IN THE HOUSE? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> WERE YOU ABLE TO HEAR THAT 
CONVERSATION? 
>> I WAS NOT ABLE TO HEAR THE 
CONVERSATION BUT AWARE THEY 
WERE DOWNSTAIRS AND I HAD TO 
WALK PAST THEM TO GET OUT OF 
THE HOUSE. 
>> OKAY. 
NOW, LET ME MAKE SUREWE'RE ON 
THE SAME PAGE, WERE YOU NOT 
ABLE TO HEAR THE CONVERSATION 
OR NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE 
CONVERSATION? 
>> I COULDN'T HEAR THE 
CONVERSATION. 
I WAS UPSTAIRS. 
>> OKAY. 
HOW DO YOU KNOW THEREWAS A 
CONVERSATION? 
>> I'M JUST ASSUMING SINCE IT 
WAS A SOCIAL GATHERING. 
PEOPLEWERE TALKING. 
I DON'T KNOW.

DR. FORD FROM HER CLASSMATES.   
1,200 ALUMNI OF THE SCHOOL, 195 
OF YOUR COLLEAGUE STUDENTS AND 
MENTORS 1,400 WOMEN AND MEN WHO 
ATTENDED D.C. SCHOOLS AND 50 
MEMBERS OF THE YALE SCHOOL 
CALLING FOR A FULL FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION SO 
ORDERED. 
>> DR. FORD AS DIFFICULT AS 
THIS EXPERIENCE MUST BE I WANT 
YOU TO KNOW THAT YOUR COURAGE 
IN COMING FORWARD HAS GIVEN 
COUNTLESS AMERICAN -- BEGIN TO 
HEAL THEIR WOUNDS. 
BY EXAMPLE, YOU HAVEBROUGHT 
MANY FAMILIES INTO AN HONEST 
AND SOMETIMES PAINFUL DIALOGUE 
THAT SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED A 
LONG TIME AGO. 
I'MSORRY FOR WHAT THIS HAS DONE 
TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. 
NO ONE, NOONE SHOULD FACE 
HARASSMENT DEATH THREATS AND 
DISPARAGING COMMENTS BY CHEAP 
SHOT POLITICIANS SIMPLY FOR 
TELLING THE TRUTH. 
YOU ANDYOUR FAMILY SHOULD KNOW 
FOR EVERY CHARGE AND PATHETIC 
TWEET THERE HAVE BEEN THOUSANDS 
OF AMERICANS WOMEN AND MEN WHO 
BELIEVE YOU, SUPPORT YOU AND 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE. 
WATCHING YOUR EXPERIENCE IT'S 
NO WONDER THAT MANY SEXUAL 
ASSAULT SURVIVORS HIDE THEIR 
PAST AND SPEND THEIR LIVES 
SUFFERING IN PAIN AND SILENCE. 
YOU HADABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO 
GAIN BY BRINGING THESE FACTS TO 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
THEFACT THAT YOU'RE TESTIFYING 
HERE TODAY  TERRIFIED THOUGH 
YOU MAY BE,    THE FACT THAT 
YOU HAVE CALLED FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION  OF THIS 
INCIDENT, THE FACT THAT YOU ARE 
PREPARED TO NAME  BOTH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AND EYEWITNESS MARK 
JUDGE STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST 
TO THE OBSTRUCTION WE'VE SEEN 
ON THE OTHER SIDE. 
THE FBI SHOULDHAVE INVESTIGATED 
YOUR CHRGES AS THEY DID IN THE 
ANITA HILL HEARING BUT THEY DID 
NOT.    
MARK JUDGE SHOULD BE SUBPOENAED 
FROM HIS BEACH HIDE AWAY 
 
TESTIFY UNDER OATH  
HE HAS NOT.    
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IF HE TRULY 
BELIEVES THERE'S NO EVIDENCE, 
NO WITNESSES THAT CAN PROVE 
YOUR CASE SHOULD BE JOINING US 
AND DEMAND AGO THOROUGH FBI 
INVESTIGATION, BUT HE HAS NOT.  
TODAY COMING BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE AND BEFORE THIS 
NATION ALONE.    
I KNOW YOU'RE JOINED BY COUNSEL 
AND FAMILY.     
THE PROSECUTOR ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE WILL CONTINUE 
TO ASK QUESTIONS TO TEST YOUR 
MEMORY AND VERACITY. 
AFTER SPENDINGDECADES TRYING TO 
FORGET THAT AWFUL NIGHT IT'S NO 
WONDER YOUR REX IS LESS THAN 
PERFECT. 
ATRAUMA SURVIVOR CANNOT BE 
EXPECTED TO REMEMBER EVERY 
PAINFUL DETAIL.      
. 
>>>  
ANY KIND WITH DR. FORD. 
I'M NOT QUESTIONINGTHAT DR. 
FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON IN 
SOME PLACE AT SOME TIME.      
LAST NIGHT THE REPUBLICAN STAFF 
OF THIS COMMITTEE RELEASED TO 
THE MEDIA A TIME LINE THAT 
SHOWS  THAT THEY INTERVIEWED 2 
PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY WERE THE 
ONES WHO ACTUALLY ASSAULTED 
YOU. 
I'M ASKING YOU TO ADDRESS THIS 
NEW DEFENSE OF MISTAKEN 
IDENTITY DIRECTLY.     
DR. FORD, WITH WHAT DEGREE OF 
CERTAINTY DO YOU BELIEVE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED YOU? 
>> 100%. 
>> 100%. 
IN THE LETTER IN WHICHYOU SENT 
TO SENATOR FINESTEIN YOU WROTE 
I HAVE NOT KNOWLY SEEN 
KAVANAUGH SINCE THE ASSAULT, I 
DID SEE MARK JUDGE ONCE AT THE 
VILLAGE SAFEWAY WHERE HE WAS 
EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE IN 
SEEING ME. 
WOULD YOU PLEASEDESCRIBE THAT 
ENCOUNTER AT THE SAFEWAY WITH 
MARK JUDGE AND WHAT LED YOU TO 
BELIEVE HE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE? 
>> YES, HE WAS GOING TO THE 
VILLAGE SAFEWAY ON THE CORNER 
OF FALLS AND RIVER ROAD. 
I WASWITH MY MOTHER. 
AND  I WAS A TEENAGER SO I 
WANTED HER TO GO IN ONE DOOR 
AND ME GO IN THE OTHER. 
SO, UM,  I CHOOSE THE WRONG 
DOOR BECAUSE THE DOOR I CHOOSE  
WAS THE ONE WHERE MARK JUDGE 
WAS  LOOKED LIKE HE WAS WORKING 
THERE.    
AND  ARRANGING THE SHOPPING 
CARTS.  
AND I SAID HELLO TO HIM.     
AND HIS FACE  WAS WHITE.      
AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SAYING 
HELLO BACK.     
AND WE HAD PREVIOUSLY  BEEN 
FRIENDLY AT THE TIMES THAT WE 
SAW EACH OTHER OVER THE 
PREVIOUS 2 YEARS ALBEIT NOT 
MANY TIMES WE HAD ALWAYS BEEN 
FRIENDLY WITH ONE ANOTHER. 
UM,I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE HIM 
AS NOT FRIENDLY. 
HE WAS JUSTNERVOUS AND NOT 
REALLY WANTING TO SPEAK WITH 
ME. 
HE LOOKED ALITTLE BIT ILL. 
>> HOW LONG DID THIS OCCUR 
AFTER THE INCIDENT? 
>> I WOULD ESTIMATE 6 TO 8 
WEEKS.     
. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> BEFORE WE TAKE A BREAK, I 
CAN'T LET WHAT THE SENATOR 
SAID, BY THE WAY, HE'S INTO 
FRIEND AND WE WORK ON A LOT OF 
LEGISLATION TOGETHER. 
BUT YOU TALKED ABOUTTHE 
OBSTRUCTION FROM THE OTHER 
SIDE.  
I CANNOT LET IT GO BY, WHAT 
YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY SO MANY 
TIMES THAT BETWEEN JULY 30TH 
AND SEPTEMBER 13TH, THERE WERE 
45 DAYS THIS COMMITTEE COULD 
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS 
SITUATION.     
AND HER PRIVACY WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PROTECTED.      
SO SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE IN 
BETWEEN ON YOUR SIDE THAT THE 
WHOLE COUNTRY -- WELL NOT THE 
WHOLE COUNTRY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
-- NO, NOT KNOW ABOUT. 
WESHOULD HAVE INVESTIGATED IT. 
WE'LL TAKE A BREAK NOW FOR 15 
MINUTES.       
. 
>> YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO 
DRAMATIC TESTIMONY ON CAPITOL 
HILL AS DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD TESTIFIES BEFORE THE 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE.     
IT'S BEEN ABOUT AN HOUR AND A 
HALF THAT THIS HEARING HAS 
TAKEN PLACE.     
AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO 
UNWRAP HERE ABOUT WHAT SHE HAS 
SO FAR SAID AND ABOUT THE 
QUESTIONS THAT SHE'S BEING 
ASKED, AND ABOUT HER 
RECOLLECTION OF THE NIGHT THAT 
SHE SAYS THAT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
ASSAULTED HER. 
WE'RE HERE ATTHE TABLE, AND YOU 
KNOW,  GUYS, THE FIRST THING 
THAT I THOUGHT OF AS I WAS 
LISTENING TO DR. FORD IS I'M 
NOT SO SURE  THAT IF YOU ARE  A 
REPUBLICAN, THAT THIS IS -- 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OPTICS 
HERE. 
>>  YEAH. 
>> AS YOU LISTEN TO DR. FORD 
AND LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAS TO 
SAY, AND THAT COMES FROM THE 
QUESTIONS THAT  RACHEL MITCHEL 
IS ASKING AND QUESTIONS THAT 
THE DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING, IT IS 
ABSOLUTELY HEART BREAKING TO 
HEAR HER SAY THAT THE MOST 
SERVING MEMORY THAT SHE STILL 
HAS FROM THE NIGHT SHE ALLEGES 
BRETT KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED HER 
WAS THE LAUGHTER. 
WHEN SENATORFINESTEIN ASKED HER 
SHE BASICALLY SAID BASIC MEMORY 
FUNCTION, I REMEMBER THAT 
NIGHT. 
>> AND SHE'S A PSYCHOLOGY 
PROFESSOR. 
AND SHE WAS 15 ATTHE TIME. 
I THINK WE NEED TOREMEMBER THAT 
AS WELL. 
BECAUSEWE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF WELL, 
THIS WAS 35 YEARS AGO. 
THINK WHEN YOU'REA 15-YEAR OLD 
GIRL, WHAT THAT KIND OF MEMORY 
AND THAT KIND OF  -- IDEA THAT 
THERE WAS LAUGHTER, WHAT THAT 
CAN DO TO A PERSON. 
AND SHE WAS ASKED, KINDOF WHAT 
WERE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU 
IN YOUR LIFE. 
SHETALKED ABOUT ANXIETY, PTSD, 
PANIC, THE INITIAL 4 YEARS 
AFTER THIS WHILE SHE WAS A 
STUDENT IN COLLEGE. 
SHE STRUGGLEDACADEMICALLY AND 
ALSO SAID SPEAKING TO THE 
QUESTION THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS 
RAISED ABOUT WHY DIDN'T YOU 
TALK ABOUT THIS EARLIER, WHY 
DIDN'T YOU COME FORWARD AT THE 
TIME. 
SHE TALKEDABOUT THE WAY IN 
WHICH SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TELL 
HER PARENTS SHE WAS AT A PARTY 
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN DRINKING. 
>>  THERE WAS A QUESTIONTHERE 
-- THE SENATOR IS MAKING HIS 
WAY OUT OF THE BRIEFING ROOM 
WITH OTHER SENATORS AND I 
DIDN'T HEAR WHAT THE QUESTION 
WAS AND WHAT HE RESPONDED. 
WE'REKEEPING AN EYE OUT ON 
THAT. 
YOU'RE RIGHT, AND YOU KNOW, 
THIS -- THIS ISN'T A PARTISAN 
ISSUE. 
THIS IS CLEARLY A WOMANWHO 
APPEARS  TO  HAVE SUFFERED 
SOMETHING HONORABLE 36 YEARS 
AGO AND IS BEING ASKED TO 
RECOUNT THAT. 
>>YEAH. 
>> IN FRONT OF A ROOM FULL OF 
PEOPLE. 
>> YOU KNOW, AS I WAS WATCHING 
RACHEL MITCHELL WHICH WE KNOW 
HER JOB IS SORT OF A TOUGH ONE. 
I THOUGHT SHE'S PERFORMING AS 
BEST SHE CAN UNDER THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES. 
TALK ABOUT THEOPTICS, WHAT I 
KEPT ON THINKING IS WHY DOES 
THIS WOMAN HAVE TO DO THIS? 
I THOUGHT INITIALLYGOING INTO 
THIS THE CONCERN ABOUT THE 
OPTICS WOULD BE THE 
REPUBLICANS, THEY HAD TO BRING 
THIS WOMAN BECAUSE THEY 
COULDN'T DO IT ON THEIR OWN. 
NOW, IT'SSORT OF LIKE THE 
ENTIRE COMMITTEE, YOU KNOW, WHY 
DOES SHE HAVE -- IT'S CLEAR 
THAT IT'S PAINFUL. 
UM -- AND SHE'S COMINGACROSS TO 
ME, AS CREDIBLE, SHE'S 
REMEMBERING THESE DETAILS, AND 
IT JUST DOESN'T -- I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT WE'RE GAINING FROM ANOTHER 
SEVERAL HOURS OF THIS. 
>> COULD IT BE THAT RACHEL 
MITCHELL -- THE CONTRAST 
BETWEEN THE QUESTIONS THAT 
DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING, WHICH 
LET'S FACE IT, ARE ELICIT AGO 
RESPONSE WHICH IS LENDING FOR A 
LOT OF PEOPLE -- IF YOU'RE 
FOLLOWING ALONG ON SOCIAL MEDIA 
TO DR. FORD'S CREDIBILITY 
WHEREAS THE -- RACHEL MITCHELL 
SEEMS TO BE  
IN AN EFFORT -- I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT TO SORT OF BLEND -- TO 
SORT OF THROW DOUBT IN THE -- 
THE QUESTION, UM, OR THE MEMORY 
THAT SHE SAYS  HAPPENED THAT 
NIGHT? 
I MEAN -- 
>> FIRST OF ALL IT FEELS LIKE A 
TRIAL. 
>>  UM-HUM. 
>> SHE'S CROSS EXAMINING. 
>> CROSS EXAMINATION. 
>> I THINK WHAT MITCHELL IS 
DOING --  
FORD FEEL COMFORTABLE SETTING 
PARAMETERS AND SETTING 
GUIDELINES FOR HOW TO RESPOND 
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS 
ACCURATE AND OF COURSE THIS IS 
ALL GOING ON THE RECORD AND IS 
UNDER OATH, WHAT I THINK SHE'S 
TRYING TO DO IS KIND OF 
ESTABLISH  THE BASIC FACTS OF 
THE CASE HERE.    
UM, AND IT IS AN AWKWARD FORMAT 
BECAUSE SHE'S GIVEN 5 MINUTES 
TO DO SO AND THEN SHIFT TO THE 
DEMOCRATIC SIDE SO THEY CAN ASK 
QUESTIONS. 
I'MWONDERING IF SHE WERE 
ALLOWED, YOU KNOW, MORE TIME TO 
ESTABLISH THESE FACTS AND DO 
THESE -- CONDUCT THIS LINE OF 
QUESTIONS THAT SHE HAS AROUND 
BASIC FACTS OF THE CASE AND 
THEN GO TO THE OTHER QUESTIONS, 
IT'S AN AWKWARD FORMAT. 
>> IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE YOU'RE 
CROSS EXAMINING. 
>> BACK AND FORTH, BACK INTO 
THAT MEMORY, BACK INTO NOW AND 
WHAT THIS ALL MEANS. 
>>  THE DEMOCRATS ARE ON A
DIFFERENT ADEPEND IT. 
FOR THEMTHE FACTS ARE WHAT SHE 
SAYS. 
>>  RIGHT. 
>> AND FINE WITH WHAT SHE'S 
PRESENTED. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> SO THEY'RE TRYING TO SORT OF 
CREATE SORT OF A DIFFERENT -- 
NOT A DIFFERENT NARRATIVE BUT 
TRYING TO FLESH OUT THE IMPACT 
OF THIS. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THEN YOU HAVE THIS FACT 
FINDING MISSION, WELL THEN, 
WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN? 
WELL, WEDON'T KNOW WHAT THE 
ENTIRE NARRATIVE IS BECAUSE WE 
HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FACT 
FINDING PART. 
IT'S VERY ODD. 
>> IT'S WHAT WE SAID, RIGHT, A 
CROSS EXAMINATION WHICH SOUNDS 
AS IF YOU'RE PUTTING A VICTIM 
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ON TRIAL. 
>>  RIGHT. 
>> AND THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY 
A GOOD LOOK. 
LET'S PLAY A LITTLEBIT -- 
 
PLAY OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
LAST HALF HOUR OR SO.  
SOUND BITE NUMBER 3.  ITTAKES 
US BACK TO THE NIGHT THAT DR. 
FORD SAYS  BRETT KAVANAUGH  AND 
MARK JUDGE  UM,  -- WHERE SHE 
FOUND HERSELF IN THIS ROOM WITH 
THESE 2 MEN. 
I WANT TO PLAY THAT. 
>> HE GROPED ME AND TRIED TO 
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. 
HE HAD AHARD TIME BECAUSE HE 
WAS -- AND I WAS WEARING A ONE 
PIECE BATHING SUIT UNDERNEATH 
MY CLOTHING. 
I BELIEVED HE WASGOING TO RAPE 
ME. 
I TRIED TOYELL FOR HELP. 
WHEN I DID HEPUT HIS HAND OVER 
MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM 
YELLING. 
THIS ISWHAT TERRIFIED ME THE 
MOST AND HAD THE MOST LASTING 
IMPACT ON MY LIFE.  
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE.  
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 
ACCIDENTALLY GOING TO KILL ME. 
BOTH BRETT AND MARK WERE 
DRUNKENLY LAUGHING DURING THE 
ATTACK. 
THEY SEEMED TO HAVEHAVING A 
GOOD TIME. 
>>  I MEAN, FOR ME, JUST
LISTENING TO THAT AS A MAN, I 
COULD FEEL MY HEART POUNDING, I 
COULD FEEL IT BREAKING IN 2. 
>> WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 
THIS HEARING AND THE CONTEXT OF 
KIND OF THE CULTURAL MOMENT, 
RIGH 
THIS HAS BECOME MORETHAN A 
HEARING FOR THE NOMINATION, THE 
CONFIRMATION OF A SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE. 
THISHAS TOUCHED LOTS OF 
DIFFERENT PEOPLE IN LOTS OF 
DIFFERENT WAYS, IT HAS BEEN 
VERY IMPACTFUL, IT HAS BROUGHT 
UP MEMORIES FROM OTHERS TO COME 
FORWARD TO TALK ABOUT THEIR OWN 
ASSAULTS AND WHAT THAT HAS 
MEANT FOR THEIR LIVE. 
THIS HAS TAKENON A GREATER 
SIGNIFICANCE IN THE COUNTRY AND 
AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF THE ME 
TOO MOVEMENT, OF COURSE AND 
WHEN WE'RE KIND REVISITING HOW 
THESE KINDS OF THINGS WERE 
HANDLED IN THE PAST AND WHAT 
WE'RE LEARNING FROM THEM GOING 
FORWARD. 
I THINKIT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO 
NOTE, YOU KNOW, THAT WE HAVE 
HEARD TESTIMONY IN WRITTEN 
FORM, THIS TIME WE'RE SEEING 
AND HEARING HER. 
I THINK IT IS VERY  UM -- IT 
GIVES A VERY -- YOU KNOW, 
VISCERAL REACTION. 
>> YES. 
>>  RIGHT. 
I THINK THAT IS VERYIMPORTANT 
AND THAT'S WHY LOTS OF 
REPUBLICANS WERE A BIT NERVOUS. 
>>  YES. 
>> ABOUT HAVING THIS -- IN THIS 
SETTING AND THE FACT THAT SHE 
IS WILLING TO SAY ALL OF THESE 
THINGS UNDER OATH AND ALSO SAID 
WHAT IS HER LEVEL OF  
CONFIDENCE THAT SHE IS 
REMEMBERING THIS CORRECTLY, AND 
THAT IT WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
AND SHE SAID 100%. 
>> YEAH, I THINK, YOU KNOW, UM, 
ALL OF US SORT OF WHEN SHE 
FIRST STARTED TALKING SORT OF 
LOOKED UP. 
YOU HAVE THESE IDEAS OFWHAT 
SHE'S GOING TO LOOK AND SOUND 
LIKE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> I THINK IT SORT OF CAUGHT US 
OFF GUARD THAT SHE WAS NO 
LONGER AN ACCUSER, SHE'S A 
WOMAN, A VICTIM.     
I THOUGHT THE OTHER THING WE 
REALLY GOT OUT OF THIS 
TESTIMONY UM IS AN ANSWER TO 
THAT QUESTION, WHY DIDN'T YOU 
COME FORWARD SOONER IN. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> AND SHE TALKS ABOUT THE 
IMPACT -- THE PRESENT DAY 
IMPACT HOW SHE'S BEEN 
RETRAUMATIZED BY THE DECISION 
TO COME FORWARD. 
LET'S PLAY SLOT NUMBER 4.  YOU
KNOW, BEFORE SHE EVEN TALKED 
ABOUT THAT SHE IDENTIFIED A 
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INSTANCES 
WHEN SHE SPOKE ABOUT THIS 
INCIDENT, RIGHT AND EVEN DIANE 
FINESTEIN SAID WELL, WHY YOU 
DIDN'T TALK ABOUT IT. 
SHE HADTO REMIND HER I TOLD YOU 
I TALKED ABOUT IT SEVERAL 
TIMES. 
>> A PART FROM THE ASSAULT 
ITSELF THESE PAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST OF 
MY LIFE.    
I'VE HAD TO RELIVE THIS TRAUMA 
IN FRONT OF THE WORLD.    
AND I'VE SEEN MY LIFE PICKED 
APART BY PEOPLE ON TELEVISION,  
ON TWITTER,    OTHER SOCIAL 
MEDIA, OTHER MEDIA AND IN THIS 
BODY WHO HAVE NEVER MET ME OR 
SPOKEN WITH ME.      
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF ACTING 
OUT OF PARTISAN POLITICAL 
MOTIVES. 
THOSE WHO SAY THAT DO NOT KNOW 
ME, I AM AN INDEPENDENT PERSON 
AND I AM NO ONE'S PAWN.      
MY MOTIVATION IN COMING FORWARD 
WAS TO BE HELPFUL.    
AND TO PROVIDE FACTS ABOUT HOW 
MR. KAVANAUGH'S ACTIONS HAVE 
DAMAGED MY LIFE.    
SO THAT YOU COULD TAKE INTO A 
SERIOUS CONSIDERATION AS YOU 
MAKE YOUR DECISION ABOUT HOW TO 
PROCEED.   
. 
>> SO THAT'S SORT OF INDIRECT 
RESPONSE TO THE PRESIDENT'S CON 
JOB MANTRA HE'S BEEN REPEATING 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 
UNLIKE THETHIRD ACCUSER, WE 
PLAYED THAT A LITTLE BIT 
EARLIER, SHE DOESN'T SAY THAT, 
SHE JUST SAYS I'M PUTTING IT 
OUT THERE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER 
ANSWERED OF STORY. 
>> SHE'S MAKING CLEAR THAT SHE 
NEVER WANTED TO OR INTENDED TO 
BE PART OF THIS STORY, TO BE 
THE STORY. 
>> YES. 
>> SHE SAID SHE BROUGHT THIS UP 
IN A CONFIDENTIAL MANNER AND 
COMMUNICATED IT WHILE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WAS STILL ON THE 
LIST, NOT WHILE HE WAS THE 
NOMINEE. 
HER POINT OF VIEW IS SHE WAS 
TRYING TO BE INFORMATIVE TO 
WHOEVER SHE COULD TELL IN TERMS 
OF WHO WOULD BE OVERSEEING THIS 
DECISION MAKING TO PICK BRETT 
KAVANAUGH OUT OF THE LST. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> UM, SO I THINK THAT TIME 
LINE IS IMPORTANT. 
AND SHE TALKSABOUT WHY SHE 
DIDN'T COME FORWARD AT THE 
TIME. 
I THINKIT'S IMPORTANT TO TALK 
ABOUT WHY SHE DIDN'T WANT HER 
NAME OUT THERE FOR THIS VERY 
REASON. 
SHETALKED ABOUT REPORTERS 
COMING TO HER HOUSE.     
TALKING TO HER DOG, COMING TO 
HER PLACE OF WORK WHICH IS  UM, 
A CLASSROOM SETTING. 
ANDMISTOOK ONE OF THEM FOR A 
STUDENT. 
SO THE INVASIVENESS OFTHIS 
WHOLE PROCESS IS JUST 
COMPLETELY, UM, JARRING TO ANY 
OF US LISTENING TO THIS 
TESTIMONY. 
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINEWHAT IT'S 
LIKE FOR HER. 
I THINKIT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
SHE'S TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE 
FACT THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO 
BE IN THE POSITION THAT SHE'S 
IN NOW. 
SHEWAS SIMPLY TRYING TO INFORM 
THOSE WHO WOULD BE MAKING A 
DECISION ABOUT A SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE. 
>> SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT RACHEL 
MITCHELL AND HOW IT APPEARS AT 
LEAST TO THOSE OF US WATCHING 
THAT SHE'S CROSS EXAMINING A 
VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
HOWDO WE --  
PERFORMANCE SO FAR?  
I MEAN IT STRIKES ME AS 
INITIALLY HIS OPENING 
STATEMENTS SEEMED TO ATTACK HER 
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. 
BUT ON THE OTHERHAND I 
SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE HE ACTUALLY 
DOESN'T WANT TO BE THERE AND 
GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS 
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT MITCH 
McCONNELL WANTS. 
>> THIS IS NOT A SITUATION THAT 
ANY OF THESE REPUBLICANS WANT 
TO BE IN AT ALL FOR STARTERS. 
HEALSO WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH 
IN HIS OPENING STATEMENTS THAT 
THEY HAVE WANTED THIS 
INORMATION  TO COME TO THE 
COMMITTEE EARLIER SO THEY COULD 
-- HE'S ARGUING COULD PROPERLY 
INVESTIGATE IT. 
OF COURSEREPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN 
LAW MEANTING THE PROCESS, THE 
WAY IN WHICH FINESTEIN WAITED 
TO BRING IT TO THE FBI OF 
COURSE ARGUING SHE WANTED TO 
PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF 
FORD. 
BUT SOTHERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS 
OVER ALL OF THIS ABOUT THE 
POLITICAL NATURE OF IT. 
I THINK IT ISIMPORTANT TO SEE 
HOW BOTH SIDES ARE INVOLVED IN 
POLITICAL BACK AND FORTH HERE 
AND LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN 
POINTS TO MAKE. 
>> SO THE SENATORS ARE STARTING 
TO MAKE THEIR WAY BACK TO THE 
BRIEFING ROOM. 
BEFORE WE GOBACK TO THIS 
HEARING I WANT TO PLAY SLOT 
NUMBER 7.  THEREPUBLICANS HAVE 
PUT OUT A THEORY I'VE STARTED 
TO CALL IT THE MISTAKEN 
IDENTITY THEORY WHERE THEY'RE 
SUGGESTING THAT PERHAPS HER 
MEMORY SHE WAS ASSAULTED THAT 
NIGHT BUT IT WASN'T BRETT 
KAVANAUGH OR MARK JUDGE. 
THEY ASKED HER WHATDEGREE OF 
CERTAINTY DOES SHE BELIEVE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED HER 
AND SHE SAYS 100%. 
HERE'S WHAT ELSE SHE SAYS ABOUT 
HOW SHE FELT THAT NIGHT.     
. 
>> WHAT IS THE STRONGORS MEMORY 
YOU HAVE  STRONGEST MEMORY OF 
THE INCIDENT, SOMETHING THAT 
YOU CAN NOT FORGET? 
TAKEWHATEVER TIME YOU NEED.    
. 
>> -- IS THE LAUGHTER -- THE 
    
AND THEIR HAVING FUN  AT MY 
EXPENSE.     
. 
>>  YOU NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT
LAUGHTER. 
>> NO. 
>> NEVER FORGOTTEN THEM 
LAUGHING AT YOU. 
>> THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH EACH 
OTHER.     
. 
>> AND YOU WERE THE OBJECT OF 
THE LAUGHTER?   
. 
>> I WAS, YOU KNOW, UNDERNEATH 
ONE OF THEM WHILE THE 2 
LAUGHED.   
2 FRIENDS HAVING A REALLY GOOD 
TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER.     
. 
>> YEAH, I'VE GOT TO SAY 
WATCHING HER  SAY THOSE WORDS  
IT -- THEY -- YOU COULD SEE 
THAT SHE WAS SORT OF RELIVING 
THAT MOMENT. 
>>YEAH. 
>> IN THE WAY THAT SHE 
DESCRIBED IT. 
AND I SORT OF THINK THATTHAT 
MOMENT THERE IS GOING TO 
CRYSTALLIZE THE ENTIRE THING. 
IN FACT, I THINK I HEARD YOU 
SAY WHEN SHE SAID THAT IT'S 
ALMOST SHE'S THIS OBJECT NOT 
EVEN THERE, SHE'S A PIECE OF 
MEAT WHILE THEY'RE HAVING A 
GOOD TIME AND SHE'S LYING 
UNDERNEATH ONE OF THEM. 
>> I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE 
MAJOR HEADLINES COMING OUT OF 
THIS. 
I THINK IT'S ALSOIMPORTANT TO 
TALK ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH SHE 
WAS ESTABLISHING WHAT THAT 
PARTY WAS LIKE. 
>> NOT A REAL PARTY SHE SAYS. 
>> IT WASN'T AS IF -- AND THE 
SCENE SHE'S SETTING THAT IT 
WASN'T THIS BIG PARTY, THAT 
SOMEONE COULD HAVE BUMPED INTO 
HER AND, UM, YOU KNOW, IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE. 
SHEKNEW THESE PEOPLE, GREW UP 
WITH THEM. 
THIS IS A COMMUNITY INWHICH ALL 
OF THESE SCHOOLS ARE MINGLING 
WITH EACH OTHER AND PEOPLE KIND 
OF KNOW EACH OTHER. 
THOSE ARE WHAT SHE WAS TRYING 
TO ESTABLISH ABOUT THE SCENE 
AND ONLY YOU KNOW, MAYBE 6 OR 
SO PEOPLE THERE IN HER 
RECOLLECTION A THAT SHE KNEW IT 
WAS MARK JUDGE AND KNEW THAT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS THERE AND 
DID THIS TO HER AND SHE SAID A 
HUNDRED PERCENT. 
>> I LIKE HOW SHE EXPLAINED HOW 
MEMORY WORKS  
ONE OF 2 THINGS IF YOU'VE 
EXPERIENCED TRAUMAS, AN 
INCIDENT THAT CHANGED YOUR 
LIFE, YOU WOULD EITHER REMEMBER 
EVERY SINGLE MINOR DETAIL. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> OR BLOCK IT OUT BECAUSE IT 
WAS SO TRAUMATIC. 
SHE REALLYEXPLAINED IT DOESN'T 
WORK LIKE THAT. 
YOU FOCUS IN ON CERTAINDETAILS 
AND NEVER FORGET THEM. 
AND THEN SOME OF THE PER RIVER 
DETAILS YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER. 
>> YES. 
>> SO YOU MIGHT NOT REMEMBER 
THAT 4TH PERSON THAT WAS IN THE 
KITCHEN AT THE TIME WHEN YOU 
WALKED IN. 
>> RIGHT, WHERE THE DOOR WAS. 
>> RIGHT, EXACTLY. 
BUT THATDOESN'T MEAN YOUR 
MEMORY IS UNRELIABLE. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT. 
>> IT IS INTERESTING THAT SHE'S 
USING HER SCIENCE BACKGROUND TO 
SORT OF PROP UP OR BUTTRESS HER 
ALLEGATION. 
AGAIN, IT GOES BACKTO WHAT WE 
WERE SAYING, IT DOES FEEL THAT 
THIS WAS A MIS -- THIS WAS A 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS. 
INSTEAD OF HAVINGRACHEL 
MITCHELL UP THIS CROSS 
EXAMINING HER THEY COULD HAVE 
ASKED THE QUESTIONS TO THEIR 
LIKING. 
AND THEY DID NOT DOTHAT I FEEL 
IS GOING TO HURT THEM. 
>>  AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO 
SHOW SOME SYMPATHY TO HER AS 
WELL. 
>>  YES. 
>>YEAH. 
>>  AND TO NEGATE THE OPTICS OF
THE SITUATION OR TRY TO TEMPER 
THEM BY SHOWING SOME AMOUNT OF 
SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING FOR 
HER ACCOUNTING. 
>> I THINK RACHEL -- I GO BACK 
AND FORTH. 
AS I'M WATCHING ITHINK SHE'S 
VERY GOOD. 
>>  SHE IS, YEAH, SHE'S DOING A 
GOOD JOB. 
>>  SHE'S A VICTIM'S ADVOCATE. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> I THINK SHE DID TRY TO MAKE, 
UM AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE. 
I THINK SHE DID A GOOD JOB. 
HAVING HER  DO -- I SUPPOSE 
QUESTIONS FOR THE REPUBLICANS, 
WHAT HAPPENS  ON THE -- FOR THE 
DEMOCRATS IS THAT  THEY RUN THE 
RISK  OF LOOKING LIKE THEY ARE  
POLITICIZING HER. 
>>  UM-HUM. 
>> BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE 
ONES ASKING THESE REALLY 
INTIMATE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT 
WAS THE --  
HAD IT TOGETHER AND ALMOST 
GOING TO CRY. 
SO IT'S THE DEMOCRATS THATARE 
DOING THAT. 
THEY HAVE TO BEVERY CAREFUL 
GOING FORWARD. 
>>  THEY LOOK AS IF THEY 
ALREADY BELIEVE EVERYTHING SHE 
HAS TO SAY, THAT WHEN JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH MAKES HIS APPEARANCE 
THEY IMMEDIATELY ATTACK HIM AS 
IF HE'S ACTUALLY DONE IT AND 
IT'S NOT A FACT FINDING 
OPPORTUNITY OR THEM. 
>>  RIGHT. 
>> AND THAT SORT OF THING, 
REMEMBER THAT A COUPLE OF 
MEMBERS OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE ON THE DEMOCRATIC 
SIDE ARE POSSIBLE 2020 
CONTENDERS. 
THIS IS A PUBLIC HEARING. 
WE'VESEEN IN THIS SETTING 
BEFORE ESPECIALLY DURING THE 
KAVANAUGH CONFIRMATION HEARINGS 
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE , YOU 
KNOW, USE THESE KINDS OF 
SETTINGS. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN 
PROFILES.      
. 
>> I THINK IT WAS -- WHO 
BROUGHT HER HER COFFEE. 
AND WE REMEMBERDURING THE 
EARLIER TESTIMONY THERE WAS -- 
THERE WERE TIMES WHERE IT 
SEEMED LIKE SENATOR BOOKER WAS 
REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE 
SPOTLIGHT, LET'S PUT IT THAT 
WAY. 
>> THAT SHOT WE WERE JUST 
SHOWING YOU, THAT IS JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S HOME. 
HE'S SOON SETTO DEPART FOR 
CAPITOL HILL. 
THEY'RE CLEARLY -- HE DID NOT 
WANT TO BE IN THE ROOM WITH 
HER, SHE DOES NOT WANT TO BE IN 
THE ROOM WITH HIM.   
SO IT WILL BE INTERESTING -- 
THE OTHER THING IS, I'M CURIOUS 
TO SEE WHEN JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
TAKES THE STAND OR WHEN HE 
APPEARS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE, 
THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS  UM, 
MOMENTS WHY  THE PRESIDENT AND 
THE PRESIDENT'S LIKE KELLYANNE 
CONWAY HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THEY 
WANT TO SEE A MORE AGGRESSIVE 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WHEN HE TAKES 
THAT STAND. 
GIVEN WHAT WE'VESEEN FROM DR. 
FORD I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL 
BE THE BEST -- 
>> SORRY. 
>> WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU 
TO GO FROM NOW UNTIL 12:40 
WITHOUT A BREAK? 
>> YES.    
. 
>> WE HAVE A BLOW UP ON THE 
RIGHT OF THE MAP THAT WAS SHOWN 
TO YOU. 
THE ADDRESS ASINDICATED ON HERE 
AS BELONGING TO YOUR FAMILY IS 
WHAT ALL THE PROPERTY TAX 
RECORDS SHOWED AS BEING YOUR 
ADDRESS. 
>> OKAY. 
>> JUST TO PUT IT INTO 
PERSPECTIVE I'D LIKE TO SHOW 
YOU A ZOOMED OUT PICTURE SO WE 
CAN PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE. 
>> OKAY.     
. 
>> SO WE CAN SHOW THE GREATER 
WASHINGTON AREA. 
YOU CAN SEETHE BELTWAY ON THAT, 
THE BELTWAY AREA. 
>> OKAY. 
>> THEN NUMBER 3, IF WE COULD 
LOOK AT THAT. 
WE DREW A ONEMILE RADIUS AROUND 
THE COUNTRY CLUB, AND THEN WE 
CALCULATED FROM THE FURTHER -- 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, AGAIN, WE 
DON'T HAVE THESE DOCUMENTS.     
NO, WE'RE NOT. 
THAT'S WHYSHE SHOWED 3 
DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS BECAUSE 
THEY DEPICT 3 I WAS DIFFERENT 
THINGS. 
SO WE'D LIKETO SEE ALL 3 
DOCUMENTS PLEASE, SO WE CAN 
FOLLOW ALONG. 
>>  PROVIDE, PLEASE. 
>> OKAY.    
UM, LOOKING AT NUMBER -- THE 
THIRD THING HERE. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> WE CALCULATED THE DISTANCE 
FROM THE  CLOSEST POINT TO YOUR 
HOUSE FROM A MILE RADIUS OF THE 
COUNTRY CLUB, UM, AND THEN THE 
FARTHEST POINT. 
YOU CAN SEEIT'S 6.2 AND OF 
COURSE 8.2 MILES. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> AND YOU'VE DESCRIBED THIS AS 
BEING NEAR THE COUNTRY CLUB 
WHEREVER THIS HOUSE WAS IS THAT 
RIGHT? 
>> I WOULD  DESCRIBE IT AS 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN  MY HOUSE AND 
THE COUNTRY CLUB IN THAT 
VICINITY THAT'S SHOWN IN YOUR 
PICTURE. 
>> OKAY. 
>> AND THE COUNTRY CLUB IS 
ABOUT 20 -- A 20-MINUTE DRIVE 
FROM MY PARENTS'S HOME. 
>> A 20-MINUTE DRIVE. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> OF COURSE I'VE MARKED AS THE 
CROW FLIES. 
>> YES. 
>> WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT 
SOMEBODY DROVE YOU  SOMEWHERE 
EITHER TO THE PARTY, OR HOME 
FROM THE PARTY?     
. 
>> CORRECT. 
>> OKAY. 
HAS ANYONE COMEFORWARD TO SAY 
TO YOU  HEY, REMEMBER, I WAS 
THE ONE THAT DROVE YOU HOME? 
>> NO. 
>> OKAY.     
UM IN YOUR JULY 6TH TEXT TO THE 
WASHINGTON POST,   THAT YOU 
LOOKED AT EARLIER, YOU SAID 
THIS HAPPENED IN THE MID-'80s. 
IN YOUR LETTER TO SENATOR 
FINESTEIN YOU SAID IT OCCURRED 
IN THE EARLY '80s. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> IN YOUR POLYGRAPH STATEMENT 
YOU SAID IT WAS HIGH SCHOOL 
SUMMER '80s AND WRITTEN IN AND 
ONE OF THE CORRECTIONS I 
REFERRED TO EARLIER AND YOU 
CROSSED THAT OUT. 
LATER IN YOURINTERVIEW WITH THE 
WASHINGTON POST, YOU WERE MORE 
SPECIFIC. 
YOU BELIEVED IT OCCURRED IN THE 
SUMMER OF 19 # 2, AND SAID THE 
END OF YOUR SOPHOMORE YEAR. 
>> YES. 
>> YOU SAID THE SAME THING I 
BELIEVE IN YOUR PREPARED 
STATEMENT. 
HOW ARE YOU ABLE TONARROW DOWN 
THE TIME FRAME? 
>> I CAN'T GIVE THE EXACT DATE 
AND  UM, I WOULD LIKE TO BE 
MORE HELPFUL ABOUT THE DATE. 
AND IF I KNEW WHEN MARK JUDGE 
WORKED AT THE SAFEWAY THEN I 
WOULD BE ABLE TO BE MORE 
HELPFUL IN THAT WAY. 
SO I'M JUST USING,UM, MEMORIES 
OF WHEN I GOT MY DRIVER'S 
LICENSE. 
I WAS 15 ATTHE TIME AND DID NOT 
DRIVE HOME FROM THAT PARTY OR 
TO THAT PARTY.     
AND ONCE I DID HAVE MY DRIVER'S 
LICENSE I LIKED TO DRIVE MYSELF 
SO -- 
>> I ASSUME THE LEGAL DRIVING 
AGE WAS 16? 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY. 
NOW, YOU'VE TALKEDABOUT 
ATTENDING THERAPY, UM,     IN 
YOUR TEXT TO THE WASHINGTON 
POST DATED 7/6. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> SO THAT'S THE VERY FIRST 
STATEMENT WE HAVE FROM YOU. 
YOUPUT IN THERE "HAVE THERAPY 
RECORDS TALKING ABOUT IT". 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE I 
UNDERSTAND THAT. 
DID YOUALREADY HAVE YOUR 
THERAPY RECORDS AT THAT TIME? 
>> I HAD LOOKED AT THEM ONLINE 
SO SEE IF THEY EXISTED, YES. 
>> OKAY, SO THIS WAS SOMETHING 
THAT WAS  AVAILABLE TO YOU VIA 
A COMPUTER LIKE A PATIENT 
PORTAL? 
>> ACTUALLY, NO, IT WAS IN THE 
OFFICE . 
>> OKAY. 
>> SHE HELPED ME GO THROUGH THE 
RECORD TO LOCATE WHETHER I HAD  
HAD RECORD OF THIS CONVERSATION 
THAT I HAD REMEMBERED.    
. 
>> DID YOU SHOW  A FULL OR 
PARTIAL SET OF THOSE MARRIAGE 
THERAPY RECORDS TO THE 
WASHINGTON POST?     
. 
>> UM, I DON'T REMEMBER. 
IREMEMBER SUMMARIZING FOR HER 
WHAT THEY SAID. 
SO I'M NOTQUITE SURE IF I 
ACTUALLY GAVE HER THE RECORD.   
. 
>> OKAY.    
UM,     SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT 
THE REPORTER DID NOT SEE THESE 
NOTES. 
? 
>> UM, I DON'T KNOW IF SHE -- I 
CAN'T RECALL WHETHER SHE SAW 
THEM INDIRECTLY OR IF I JUST 
TOLD HER WHAT THEY SAID. 
>> OKAY. 
HAVE YOU SHOWN THEM TOANYONE 
ELSE BESIDES YOU'RE COUNSEL. 
>>  JUST THE COUNSEL. 
>> OKAY. 
UM, WOULD IT BE FAIRTO SAY THAT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NAME IS NOT 
LISTED IN THOSE NOTES? 
>> HIS NAME IS NOT LISTED IN 
THOSE NOTES. 
>> WOULD IT ALSO BE FAIR TO SAY 
THAT THE THERAPIST'S NOTES WE 
WERE TALKING ABOUT SAY THERE 
WERE 4 BOYS IN THE ROOM? 
>> UM, IT DESCRIBES THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, AND IT SAYS  
ERRONEOUSLY BY 4 BOYS SO THE 
THERAPIST GOT THE CONTENT OF IT 
WRONG. 
>> AND YOU CONNECTED THAT TO 
THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTER, 
CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> SENATOR WHITEHOUSE. 
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRMAN. 
THANKYOU DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD. 
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF 
YOU TODAY. 
FROM A PROSECUTOR'S VIEWONE OF 
THE HARDEST THINGS THAT  WE 
HAVE TO DO  IS TO  SPEAK TO 
SOMEBODY WHO HAS COME FORWARD  
WITH AN ALLEGATION OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT AND LET THEM KNOW THAT  
WE CAN'T PROVIDE THE EVIDENCE  
TO GO FORWARD TO TRIAL.      
IT'S A HARD DAY FOR THE 
PROSECUTOR TO DO THAT.   
. 
>> UM-HUM. 
>> AND SO BOTH BECAUSE  MAKING  
 
INVESTIGATIVE EFFORT IS SUCH AN 
IMPORTANT CONSOLATION TO THE 
VICTIM IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND 
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT YOU'RE OWE 
BRIDGED TO DO PROFESSIONALLY 
SINCERE AND THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION    IS CRITICAL TO 
THESE CLAIMS IN A PROSECUTOR'S 
WORLD.     
IT MAY BE THE MOST BASIC THING 
THAT WE OWE A VICTIM  OR A 
WITNESS COMING FORWARD  IS TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE THEM A 
FULL  THOROUGH AND SINCERE 
INVESTIGATION.     
YOU HAVE MET ALL OF THE  
STANDARDS OF WHAT I MIGHT CALL 
PRELIMINARY CREDIBILITY WITH 
YOUR  INITIAL STATEMENT.     
UM, YOU HAVE  VIVID, SPECIFIC 
AND DETAILED RECOLLECTIONS, 
SOMETHING PROSECUTORS LOOK FOR. 
YOUR RECOLLECTIONS ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN FACTS.    
YOU MADE PRIOR CONSISTENT 
STATEMENTS, SOMETHING ELSE 
PROSECUTORS AND LAWYERS LOOK 
FOR. 
YOU'RE WILLING TO ANDDID TAKE A 
LIE DETECTOR TEST AND WILLING 
TO TESTIFY    HERE. 
HERE YOU ARE SUBJECTTO 
PROFESSIONAL CROSS EXAMINATION  
BY A PROSECUTOR.      
SO YOU'VE MET  ANY CONDITION , 
ANY PROSECUTOR COULD EXPECT TO 
GO FORWARD, AND YET, THERE HAS 
BEEN NO  SINCERE  OR THOROUGH  
INVESTIGATION  OF YOUR CLAIMS.  
YOU SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR AN 
FBI INVESTIGATION, DID YOU NOT? 
>> YOU HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING. 
>> YES. 
>> AND ARE YOU AWARE THAT WHEN 
THE FBI BEGINS INVESTIGATING 
THEY MIGHT FIND CORROBORATE 
EVIDENCE AND MIGHT FIND EX CULL 
TORE EVIDENCE. 
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT EX CULL 
TORE EVIDENCE IS. 
>> NOT HELPFUL TO YOUR 
RECOLLECTION AND VERSION OF 
EVENTS HELPFUL TO THE ACCUSED. 
>> YES. 
>> . 
>> YES. 
>> AND YOU'RE STILL    NOT JUST 
WILLING, BUT  INSISTENT THAT 
THE FBI SHOULD INVESTIGATE YOUR 
RECOLLECTION AND YOUR  CLAIM? 
>> YES, I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD   
-- I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL IN 
THAT IF THAT WAS THE CASE IN 
PROVIDING SOME OF THE DETAILS 
THAT MAY BE  PEOPLE ARE WANTING 
TO KNOW ABOUT.   
. 
>> AND AS WE KNOW THEY DIDN'T   
AND I SUBMIT  THAT NEVER  NEVER 
IN THE HISTORY OF BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATIONS    HAS AN 
INVESTIGATION NOT  BEEN PURSUED 
WHEN NEW, CREDIBLE INFORMATION 
WAS BROUGHT FORWARD    ABOUT 
THE NOMINEE OR THE CANDIDATE.   
I DON'T THINK THIS HAS EVER 
HAPPENED  IN THE HISTORY OF FBI 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS. 
MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN PROVE ME 
WRONG BUT IT'S WILDLY UNUSUAL 
AND OUT OF CHARACTER.     
AND IN MY VIEW, IT IS A GRAVE 
DISSERVICE TO YOU AND I WANT TO 
TAKE THIS MOMENT TO APOLOGIZE 
TO YOU FOR THAT. 
ANDTO REPORT TO ANYBODY WHO 
MIGHT BE LISTENING THAT WHEN 
SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO COME 
FORWARD EVEN UNDER THOSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN HAVING BEEN 
NOT GIVEN THE MODICUM OF 
COURTESY AND SUPPORT OF A 
PROPER INVESTIGATION, UM,   
YOU'VE SHOWN YOURSELF 
PARTICULARLY PROUD IN DOING 
THAT.    
AND THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE 
DECISION   TO HAVE THIS BE, I 
THINK THE ONLY BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION  IN HISTORY  TO 
BE STOPPED AS DEROGATORY 
INFORMATION CAME FORWARD, 
BELONGS WITH 13 MEN,    THE 
PRESIDENT, DIRECTOR OF THE FBI 
AND THE 11 MEMBERS  OF THE 
MAJORITY OF THIS  COMMITTEE.    
AS TO THE COMMITTEE'S 
INVESTIGATION, THE FACT THAT 
MR. KAVANAUGH'S ALLEGED 
ACCOMPLICE HAS NOT BEEN 
SUBPOENAED,  
AND CROSS EXAMINED UNDER OATH, 
HAS NOT BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE 
FBI TELLS YOU ALL YOU NEED TO 
KNOW ABOUT HOW CREDIBLE  THIS 
PERFORMANCE IS.      
THE VERY BARE MINIMUM IN A 
PERSON WHO COMES FORWARD IS  
OWED  IS SINCERE AND THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION  AND YOU'VE BEEN 
DENIED THAT. 
AND IWILL MAKE A PERSONAL 
PLEDGE TO YOU HERE THAT HOWEVER 
LONG IT TAKES IN WHAT FORUM -- 
I WOULD DO WHATEVER IS IN MY 
POWER TO MAKE SURE YOUR CLAIMS 
GET A FULL AND PROPER 
INVESTIGATION AND NOT JUST 
THIS. 
THANK YOU FOR BEINGHERE. 
>> THANK YOU.      
. 
>> SINCE THIS ISSUE HAS COME UP 
SO MANY TIMES I'D LIKE TO 
COMMENT.      
THE NEW YORKER PUBLISHED  AN 
ANONYMOUS ACCOUNT OF 
ALLEGATIONS SEPTEMBER THE 14TH. 
2 DAYSLATER DR. FORD IDENTIFIED 
HERSELF AS A VICTIM IN A POST 
ARTICLE.    
DETAILING HER ALLEGATIONS. 
I IMMEDIATELYDIRECTED MY STAFF 
TO INVESTIGATION.     
SEPTEMBER THE 17TH, DR. FORD'S 
COUNSEL WENT ON SEVERAL 
TELEVISION SHOWS REQUESTING 
THAT HER CLIENT HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO TELL HER STORY.  
THE SAME DAY I SCHEDULED A 
HEARING FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 
THE 24TH GIVEN DR. FORD A WEEK 
TO PREPARE HER TESTIMONY AND 
COME TO WASHINGTON, D.C.  ON
SEPTEMBER 17TH COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATING STAFF REACHED OUT 
TO DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
TO SCHEDULE FOLLOW-UP 
INTERVIEWS WITH REPUBLICAN AND 
DEMOCRATIC INVESTIGATORS. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGHACCEPTED THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO THE 
INVESTIGATORS UNDER CRIMINAL 
PENALTY. 
DR. FORDDECLINED. 
IN HIS INTERVIEW ONSEPTEMBER 
THE 17TH JUDGE KAVANAUGH DENIED 
THE ALLEGATIONS AND REQUESTED A 
HEARING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
DEMOCRATIC STAFFREFUSED TODAY 
PARTICIPATE IN A IN THAT 
INTERVIEW. 
THE NEXT DAYSEPTEMBER 18TH 
COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIVE STAFF 
CONTACTED MARK JUDGE REQUESTING 
AN INTERVIEW, COMMITTEE STAFF 
ALSO LEARNED THE IDENTITY OF 2 
OTHER ALLEGED PARTY GOERS AND 
REQUESTED INTERVIEWS. 
MARKJUDGE SUBMITTED A STATEMENT 
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY DENYING 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARTY 
DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD.    
AND STATES THAT HE NEVER SAW 
BRETT IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED 
BY DR. FORD.      
AND I CAN GO ON AND ON ABOUT 
THAT.     
BUT WE'VE GOT TO REALIZE THAT 
WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS CASE  
OF ALL THE TIME YOU GO THROUGH 
A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION,   
BY THE FBI,   THEN IT COMES TO 
US.     
TORY
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
>> MR. CHAIRMAN.
>> -- MS. MITCHELL.
>> I WANT TO POINT OUT TO
SUPPORT WHAT SENATOR WHITEHOUSE
SAID IN THE A TEET A HILL CASE
GEORGE BUSH ORDERED THE
INVESTIGATION BE OPENED AGAIN.
>> MS. MITCHELL, WILL YOU
PROCEED FOR SENATOR LEE.
>> THANK YOU,
 MR. 
>>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED IN 
THEIR SEPTEMBER 16 ARTICLE THAT 
YOU DID SHOW THEM THERAPIST 
NOTES. 
IS THAT INCORRECT? 
>>  I DON'T REMEMBER PHYSICALLY 
SHOWING HER A NOTE. 
PERHAPS MY COUNSEL DID. 
I DON'T REMEMBER PHYSICALLY 
SHOWING HER MY COPY OF THE 
NOTE. 
I JUST DON'T REMEMBER. 
I'M SORRY. 
I HAVE RETRIEVED A PHYSICAL 
COPY OF THOSE MEDICAL RECORDS. 
>>  OKAY, THANK YOU. 
YOU ALSO ATTENDED INDIVIDUAL 
THERAPY. 
DID YOU SHOW ANY OF THOSE NOTES 
TO THE REPORTER FROM THE 
WASHINGTON POST? 
>>  AGAIN, I DON'T REMEMBER IF 
I SHOWED HER SOMETHING THAT I 
SUMMARIZED OR IF I SPOKE ABOUT 
IT. 
OR IF SHE SAW IT IN MY 
COUNSEL'S OFFICE. 
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. 
I CERTAINLY SPOKE WITH HER 
ABOUT THE 2013 RECORD WITH THE 
INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST. 
>>  AND BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NAME 
IS NOT IN THOSE NOTES, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  IN READING THE WASHINGTON 
POST ARTICLE, IT MENTIONS THAT 
THIS INCIDENT THAT WE'RE HERE 
ABOUT CONTRIBUTED TO ANXIETY 
AND PTSD PROBLEMS WITH WHICH 
YOU HAVE STRUGGLED. 
THE WORD CONTRIBUTED, DOES THAT 
MEAN THERE ARE OTHER THINGS 
THAT HAVE HAPPENED THAT HAVE 
ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO ANXIETY AND 
PTSD? 
>>  I THINK THAT'S A GREAT 
QUESTION. 
I THINK THE EDOLOGY OF ANXIETY 
IS MULTIFACTORIAL. 
THAT WAS A CRITICAL RISK -- WE 
WOULD CALL IT A RISK FACTOR. 
IT WOULD BE A PREDICTER OF THE 
SYMPTOMS I HAVE. 
IT DOESN'T MEAN OTHER THINGS 
WOULD HAVE MADE IT WORSE. 
>>  ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT 
HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ANXIETY 
AND PTSD THAT YOU SUFFERED? 
>>  WELL, I THINK THERE'S 
BIOLOGICAL PREDISPOSITIONS THAT 
EVERYONE IN HERE HAS FOR 
PARTICULAR DISORDERS. 
SO I CAN'T RULE OUT THAT I 
WOULD HAVE SOME BIOLOGICAL 
PREDISPOSITION. 
I'M AN ANXIOUS PERSON. 
>>  WHAT ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL? 
>>  ENVIRONMENTALLY, NOT THAT I 
CAN THINK OF. 
>>  OKAY. 
>>  CERTAINLY NOTHING AS 
STRIKING AS THAT EVENT. 
>>  OKAY. 
IN YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE 
WASHINGTON POST, YOU SAID THAT 
YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND EARLY IN 
YOUR MARRIAGE THAT YOU HAD BEEN 
A VICTIM OF, AND I QUOTE, 
PHYSICAL ABUSE. 
IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT 
BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED, YOU 
TOLD HIM YOU EXPERIENCED QUOTE, 
A SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
DO THESE TWO THINGS REFER TO 
THE SAME INCIDENT? 
>>  YES. 
>>  AND AT EITHER POINT ON 
THESE TWO TIMES, DID YOU USE 
ANY NAMES? 
>>  NO. 
>>  OKAY. 
MAY I ASK DR. FORD, HOW DID YOU 
GET TO WASHINGTON? 
>>  IN AN AIRPLANE. 
>>  OKAY. 
>>  I ASK THAT BECAUSE IT'S 
BEEN REPORTED BY THE PRESS THAT 
YOU WOULD NOT SUBMIT TO AN 
INTERVIEW WITH THE COMMITTEE 
BECAUSE OF YOUR FEAR OF FLYING. 
IS THAT TRUE? 
>>  I WAS HOPING THEY WOULD 
COME TO ME, BUT I REALIZED THAT 
WAS AN UNREALISTIC REQUEST. 
>>  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A 
QUICKER TRIP FOR ME. 
>>  YES. 
THAT WAS CERTAINLY WHAT I WAS 
HOPING, TO AVOID HAVING TO GET 
ON AN AIRPLANE. 
I EVENTUALLY WAS ABLE TO GET UP 
THE GUMPTION AND GET ON THE 
PLANE. 
>>  WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE 
MID ATLANTIC AREA BACK IN 
AUGUST, THE END OF JULY, 
AUGUST, HOW DID YOU GET HERE? 
>>  ALSO BY AIRPLANE. 
I COME HERE ONCE A YEAR DURING 
THE SUMMER TO VISIT MY FAMILY. 
I'M SORRY, NOT HERE. 
I GO TO DELAWARE. 
>>  OKAY. 
IN FACT, YOU FLY FAIRLY 
FREQUENTLY FOR YOUR HOBBIES AND 
YOU'VE HAD TO FLY FOR YOUR 
WORK, IS THAT TRUE? 
>>  CORRECT. 
UNFORTUNATELY. 
>>  YOU WERE A CONSULTING 
STATUSITION. 
>>  THE COMPANY I WORKED FOR IS 
BASED IN AUSTRALIA AND THEY 
HAVE AN OFFICE IN SAN 
FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. 
I DON'T THINK I'LL MAKE IT TO 
AUSTRALIA. 
>>  IT IS LONG. 
I ALSO SAW THAT YOU LIST THE 
FOLLOWING INTERESTS OF TRAVEL 
AND YOU PUT HAWAII, CROWSLY 
COSTA RICA. 
AND OCEANOGRAPHY AND CULTURE. 
DID YOU TRAVEL BY AIR AS A PART 
OF THOSE INTERESTS? 
>>  CORRECT. 
EASIER FOR ME TO TRAVEL GOING 
THAT DIRECTION WHEN IT'S A 
VACATION. 
>>  THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE DR. 
FORD. 
YOU KNOW, IN MY JOB AS A 
PROSECUTOR, WE INVESTIGATED 
REPORTS LIKE THIS. 
SO, IT GAVE ME A WINDOW ON THE 
TYPES OF CASES THAT HURT WOMEN 
AND HURT ALL OF US. 
AND I WOULD ALWAYS TELL THE 
WOMEN THAT CAME BEFORE US THAT 
THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE TO TELL 
THEIR STORY BEFORE A JURY BOX 
OF STRANGERS. 
YOU'VE HAD TO TELL YOUR STORY 
BEFORE THE ENTIRE NATION. 
FOR SO MANY YEARS, PEOPLE SWEPT 
CASES LIKE YOURS UNDER THE RUG. 
THEY WOULD SAY, WHAT HAPPENS 
INSIDE A HOUSE DIDN'T BELONG IN 
THE COURTHOUSE. 
WELL, THE TIMES HAVE CHANGED. 
SO I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
COMING FORWARD TODAY AND FOR 
SHARING YOUR REPORT WITH US. 
NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE 
TAKEN A POLYGRAPH TEST. 
DR. FORD, THAT FOUND THAT YOU 
WERE BEING TRUTHFUL WHEN YOU 
DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU DECIDED 
TO TAKE THAT TEST? 
>>  I WAS MEETING WITH 
ATTORNEYS. 
I WAS INTERVIEWING VARIOUS 
ATTORNEYS AND THE ATTORNEYS 
ASKED IF I WAS WILLING TO TAKE 
IT AND I SAID ABSOLUTELY. 
THAT SAID, IT WAS ALMOST AS 
ANXIETY PROVOKING AS AN 
AIRPLANE FLIGHT. 
>>  OKAY. 
AND YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT YOUR 
RECOLLECTIONS AND SEEING MARK 
JUDGE AT THAT SAFEWAY. 
IF THERE HAD BEEN AN 
APPROPRIATE REOPENING OF THIS 
BACKGROUND CHECK AND FBI 
INTERVIEWS, WOULD THAT HELP YOU 
FIND THE TIME PERIOD IF YOU 
KNEW WHEN HE WORKED AT THAT 
SAFEWAY? 
>>  I FEEL LIKE I COULD BE MUCH 
MORE HELPFUL IF I COULD BE 
PROVIDED WITH THAT DATE THROUGH 
EMPLOYMENT RECORDS OR THE IRS. 
ANYTHING. 
THAT WOULD HELP. 
>>  I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S TRUE. 
DR. FORD, UNDER FEDERAL LAW, 
STATEMENTS MADE TO MEDICAL 
PROFESSIONALS ARE CONSIDERED TO 
BE MORE RELIABLE. 
THERE'S A FEDERAL RULE OF 
EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS. 
YOU TOLD YOUR COUNSELOR ABOUT 
THIS BACK IN 2012. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>>  MY THERAPIST. 
MY INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST, 
CORRECT. 
>>  RIGHT. 
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR 
HUSBAND WAS ALSO PRESENT WHEN 
YOU SPOKE ABOUT THIS INCIDENT 
IN FRONT OF A COUNSELOR AND HE 
RECALLS YOU USING JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S NAME. 
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>>  YES. 
I HAVE TO SLOW DOWN A MINUTE 
BECAUSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
CONFUSING. 
THERE WERE TWO SEPARATE 
INCIDENTS WHERE IT'S REFLECTED 
IN MY MEDICAL RECORD. 
I TALKED ABOUT IT MORE THAN 
THOSE TWO TIMES, BUT THERAPISTS 
DON'T TYPICALLY WRITE DOWN 
CONTENT AS MUCH AS THEY WRITE 
DOWN PROCESS. 
THEY ARE USUALLY TRACKING YOUR 
SYMPTOMS AND NOT YOUR STORY AND 
THE FACTS. 
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE IT IN MY 
RECORD TWICE. 
SO, THE FIRST TIME IS IN 2012 
WITH MY HUSBAND IN COUPLES 
THERAPY. 
AND THEN IN 2013, WITH MY 
INDIVIDUAL THERAPIST. 
>>  SO IF SOMEONE HAD ACTUAL 
DONE AN INVESTIGATION, YOUR 
HUSBAND WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
SAY YOU NAMED HIS NAME AT THAT 
TIME. 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  OKAY. 
I KNOW -- 2012. 
>>  I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN 
CONCERNED WITH YOUR PRIVACY 
THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND YOU 
FIRST REQUESTED YOUR ACCOUNT 
WITH KEPT CONFIDENTIAL. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHY. 
>>  YES. 
SO AS I STATED BEFORE, ONCE I 
WAS UNSUCCESSFUL IN GETTING MY 
INFORMATION TO YOU BEFORE THE 
CANDIDATE WAS CHOSEN, MY 
ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO GET THE 
INFORMATION WHEN THERE WAS 
STILL A LIST OF OTHER 
CANDIDATES AVAILABLE. 
AND ONCE THAT WAS NOT 
SUCCESSFUL AND I SAW THAT 
PERSONS WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 
THE NOMINEE. 
I TRACKED IT ALL SUMMER AND 
REALIZED THAT WHEN I WAS 
CALCULATING THAT RISK BENEFIT 
RATIO, IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS 
GOING TO JUST SUFFER ONLY FOR 
NO REASON. 
>>  OKAY. 
YOU KNOW FROM MY EXPERIENCE 
WITH MEMORY, I REMEMBER 
DISTINCTLY THINGS THAT HAPPENED 
TO ME IN HIGH SCHOOL OR 
HAPPENED TO ME IN COLLEGE. 
BUT I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER 
THE DATE. 
I DON'T EXACTLY REMEMBER THE 
TIME. 
I SOMETIMES MAY NOT REMEMBER 
THE EXACT PLACE WHERE IT 
OCCURRED. 
BUT I REMEMBER THE INTERACTION. 
AND MANY PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED 
TODAY ON WHAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE 
TO REMEMBER ABOUT THAT NIGHT. 
I ACTUALLY THINK YOU REMEMBER A 
LOT. 
I'M GOING TO PHRASE IT 
DIFFERENTLY. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOU DON'T 
FORGET ABOUT THAT NIGHT. 
>>  THE STAIRWELL. 
THE LIVING ROOM. 
THE BEDROOM. 
THE BED ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF 
THE ROOM AS YOU WALK INTO THE 
ROOM. 
THERE WAS A BED TO THE RIGHT. 
THE BATHROOM IN CLOSE 
PROXIMITY. 
THE LAUGHTER. 
THE UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. 
AND THE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO 
ESCAPE AND THE FINAL ABILITY TO 
DO SO. 
>>  THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR. 
FORD. 
>>  DR. FORD, I WANT TO CORRECT 
THE RECORD. 
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M SAYING 
THAT YOU STATED WRONGLY BECAUSE 
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE FACT THAT 
WHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU DIDN'T 
THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR US TO 
OR INVESTIGATORS GO TO OMMITTEE 
CALIFORNIA TO TALK TO YOU, WE 
DID IN FACT OFFER THAT TO YOU 
AND WE HAD THE CAPABILITY OF 
DOING IT AND WE WOULD HAVE DONE 
IT ANYWHERE OR ANY TIME. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN, COULD I PUT 
THE POLYGRAPH RESULTS ON THE 
RECORD, PLEASE. 
THE POLYGRAPH RESULTS IN THE 
RECORD. 
IS THERE ANY OBJECTION? 
>>  LET US SEE THE CHART. 
>>  THE POLYGRAPH. 
YOU WANT TO SEE IT? 
I THINK YOU MAY HAVE IT. 
>>  CAN WE HAVE THE UNDERLYING 
CHARTS, TOO? 
>>  I HAVE THE POLYGRAPH 
RESULTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO 
PUT IN THE RECORD. 
I'LL DEAL WITH THE CHARTS AFTER 
THAT. 
COULD I PUT THE POLYGRAPH TEST 
IN THE RECORD? 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN, WE HAD 
PROPOSED HAVING THE POLYGRAPH 
EXAMINER TESTIFY, AS YOU KNOW. 
IF THAT HAD HAPPENED, THE FULL 
MATERIALS HE HAD SUPPORTING HIS 
EXAMINATION WOULD HAVE BEEN 
PROVIDED. 
YOU REJECTED THAT REQUEST. 
SO WHAT WE DID PROVIDE WAS THE 
POLYGRAPH REPORT, WHICH IS WHAT 
THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 
CURRENTLY HAVE. 
>>  AND ON SEPTEMBER 26, MR. 
CHAIRMAN, THIS WAS ACTUALLY 
SENT TO YOUR CHIEF COUNSEL. 
I JUST WANT TO SHARE IT WITH 
AMERICA SO THAT THEY HAVE THIS 
REPORT AS WELL. 
>>  OKAY, WE WILL ACCEPT 
WITHOUT OBJECTION WHAT YOU HAVE 
ASKED US TO INCLUDE. 
WE ARE ALSO REQUESTING AND 
EXPECT THE OTHER MATERIALS THAT 
I JUST STATED. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN, YOU WOULDN'T 
ALLOW THE UNDERLYING WITNESS 
WHO PERFORMED THE POLYGRAPH 
TEST TO TESTIFY NOR WOULD YOU 
ALLOW MARK JUDGE TO TESTIFY. 
SO, I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT 
OUT, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING 
THIS REPORT IN THE RECORD, BUT 
THAT IS THE REASON THAT WE 
DON'T HAVE THE UNDERLYING 
INFORMATION FOR YOU. 
>>  YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED. 
I THINK YOU WOULD BE SATISFIED. 
>>  I AM SATISFIED WITH THAT, 
THANK YOU. 
>>  SENATOR, GO AHEAD. 
>>  WHEN WAS THE POLYGRAPH 
ADMINISTERED? 
>>  IT WAS ADMINISTERED ON 
AUGUST 7, 2018, AND IT WAS THE 
DATE OF THE REPORT IS AUGUST 
10, 2018. 
>>  WHEN WAS IT PROVIDED TO THE 
COMMITTEE? 
>>  LET'S SEE IF WE CAN'T DO 
THIS IN A MORE ORDERLY WAY. 
>>  HE WAS ASKING AND I HAVE IT 
RIGHT HERE AND YOU HAVE IT AS 
WELL  IT WAS SEPTEMBER 26. 
>>  WE HAVE ACCEPTED IT. 
>>  MS. MITCHELL, FOR SENATOR 
CRUZ. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
DR. FORD, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT 
THE DAY AND THE NIGHT THAT 
YOU'VE DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMER 
OF 1982. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO 
DO THAT. 
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT. 
I WOULD LIKE TO SHIFT GEARS AND 
DISCUSS THE LAST SEVERAL 
MONTHS. 
>>  OKAY. 
>>  IN YOUR STATEMENT, YOU SAID 
THAT ON JULY 6, YOU HAD A QUOTE 
SENSE OF URGENCY TO RELAY THE 
INFORMATION TO THE SENATE AND 
THE PRESIDENT. 
DID YOU CONTACT EITHER THE 
SENATE OR THE PRESIDENT ON OR 
BEFORE JULY 6? 
>>  I DID NOT. 
I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. 
>>  OKAY. 
PRIOR TO JULY 6, HAD YOU SPOKEN 
TO ANY MEMBER OF CONGRESS? 
WHEN I SAY CONGRESS, I MEAN THE 
SENATE OR THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES OR ANY 
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MEMBERS 
ABOUT YOUR ALLEGATIONS? 
>>  NO. 
>>  WHY DID YOU CONTACT THE 
WASHINGTON POST ON JULY 6? 
>>  SO, I WAS PANICKING BECAUSE 
I KNEW THE TIME LINE WAS SHORT 
FOR THE DECISION. 
PEOPLE WERE GIVING ME ADVICE ON 
THE BEACH. 
PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE 
PROCESSES. 
BUT THEY WERE GIVING ME ADVICE 
AND MANY PEOPLE TOLD ME, YOU 
NEED TO HIRE A LAWYER. 
I DIDN'T DO THAT. 
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WOULD 
NEED A LAWYER. 
SOMEBODY SAID, CALL THE "NEW 
YORK TIMES." 
CALL THE WASHINGTON POST. 
PUT IN AN ANONYMOUS TIP. 
GO TO YOUR CONGRESSPERSON. 
WHEN I WEIGHED THOSE OPTIONS, I 
FELT LIKE THE BEST OPTION WAS 
TO DO THE CIVIC ROUTE, WHICH IS 
TO GO TO MY CONGRESSPERSON WHO 
HAPPENS TO BE ANNA. 
I CALLED HER OFFICE AND I ALSO 
PUT IN THE ANONYMOUS TIP TO THE 
WASHINGTON POST AND NEITHER, 
UNFORTUNATELY, NEITHER GOT BACK 
TO ME BEFORE THE SELECTION OF 
THE NOMINEE. 
>>  YOU TESTIFIED THAT 
CONGRESSWOMAN'S OFFICE 
CONTACTED YOU ON JULY 9. IS 
THAT RIGHT? 
>>  THEY CONTACTED ME THE DATE 
THAT THE NOMINEE WAS ANNOUNCED. 
THAT SEEMS LIKELY. 
>>  HAD YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR 
ALLEGATIONS WITH ANYONE IN HER 
OFFICE BEFORE THE DATE OF JULY 
9? 
>>  I TOLD THE RECEPTIONIST ON 
THE PHONE. 
>>  OKAY. 
ON JULY 10, YOU TEXTED THE 
WASHINGTON POST AGAIN, WHICH 
WAS REALLY THE THIRD TIME, IS 
THAT RIGHT? 
SECOND DATE, THIRD TIME. 
>>  LET'S SEE. 
CORRECT. 
>>  AND YOU TEXTED, BEEN 
ADVISED TO CONTACT SENATORS OR 
NEW YORK TIMES, HAVEN'T HEARD 
BACK FROM WASHINGTON POST. 
WHO ADVISED YOU TO CONTACT 
SENATORS OR THE NEW YORK TIMES? 
>>  BEACH FRIENDS. 
COMING UP WITH IDEAS OF HOW I 
COULD TRY TO GET TO PEOPLE. 
BECAUSE PEOPLE WEREN'T 
RESPONDING TO ME VERY QUICKLY. 
VERY QUICKLY, THEY RESPONDED TO 
THAT TEXT FOR AN UNKNOWN 
REASON. 
ONCE I SENT THAT ENCRYPTED 
TEXT, THEY RESPONDED VERY 
QUICKLY. 
>>  DID YOU CONTACT THE NEW 
YORK TIMES? 
>>  NO. 
>>  WHY NOT? 
>>  I WASN'T INTERESTED IN 
PURSUING THE MEDIA ROUTE 
PARTICULARLY. 
SO I FELT LIKE ONE WAS ENOUGH. 
THE WASHINGTON POST. 
AND I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT DOING 
THAT. 
MY PREFERENCE WAS TO TALK WITH 
MY CONGRESSPERSON. 
>>  OKAY. 
THE WASHINGTON POST TEXTED BACK 
THAT SOMEONE WOULD GET YOU IN 
TOUCH WITH A REPORTER. 
DID YOU SUBSEQUENTLY TALK TO A 
REPORTER WITH THE WASHINGTON 
POST? 
>>  YES. 
UNDER THE ENCRYPTED APP. 
AND OFF THE RECORD. 
>>  OKAY. 
WHO WAS THAT REPORTER? 
>>  EMMA BROWN. 
>>  OKAY. 
THE PERSON WHO ULTIMATELY WROTE 
THE STORY ON SEPTEMBER 16. 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  OKAY. 
DID YOU TALK TO ANY MEMBER OF 
CONGRESS AND AGAIN REMEMBER 
CONGRESS INCLUDES THE SENATE OR 
THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OR 
ANY CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MEMBERS 
ABOUT YOUR ALLEGATIONS BETWEEN 
JULY 10 AND JULY 30, WHICH WAS 
THE DATE OF YOUR LETTER TO 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
>>  YES. 
I MET WITH CONGRESSWOMAN'S 
ESHU'S STAFF. 
THAT WAS ON THE WEDNESDAY, AND 
THE FRIDAY I MET WITH THE 
CONGRESSWOMAN HERSELF. 
>>  OKAY. 
WHEN YOU MET WITH HER, DID YOU 
MEET WITH HER ALONE OR DID 
SOMEONE COME WITH YOU? 
>>  I WAS ALONE. 
SHE HAD A STAFF PERSON. 
>>  OKAY. 
>>  WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT 
WITH THE CONGRESSWOMAN AND HER 
STAFF ON JULY 18 AND THE 20th? 
>> . 
>>  I DESCRIBED THE NIGHT OF 
THE INCIDENT AND WE SPENT TIME 
SPEAKING ABOUT THAT.
I TALKED TO HER ABOUT MY 
OPTIONS GOING FORWARD AND HOW 
TO GET THAT INFORMATION RELAYED 
GOING FORWARD AND FEARS OF 
WHETHER THIS WAS CONFIDENTIAL 
INFORMATION AND SHE DISCUSSED 
THE CONSTITUENT CONFIDENT 
CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE. 
>>  I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT FIVE 
ARTICLES. 
ONE WHY SEXUAL ASSAULT MEMORIES 
STICK AND ONE ENTITLED, WHY 
DIDN'T KAVANAUGH ACCUSER COME 
EARLIER. 
>>  WITHOUT OBJECTION, DR. 
FORD. 
I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING YOU 
FOR COMING TO TESTIFY IN FRONT 
OF US TODAY. 
YOU CAME FORWARD WITH VERY 
SERIOUS AND RELEVANT 
INFORMATION ABOUT A NOMINEE FOR 
A LIFETIME POSITION ON OUR 
SUPREME COURT. 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO. 
AND I KNOW YOU'VE DONE IT AT 
GREAT PERSONAL COST. 
THIS IS A PUBLIC SERVICE AND I 
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M 
GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM YOU 
DIRECTLY TODAY. 
I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST FOLLOW UP 
ON THAT LINE OF QUESTIONING. 
MS. MITCHELL WAS FOLLOWING. 
YOU CHOSE TO COME FORWARD WITH 
YOUR CONCERNS BEFORE HE WAS 
NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
DO I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THAT 
WHEN YOU FIRST REACHED OUT TO 
CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO AND TO THE 
TIP LINE, THAT'S WHEN HE WAS ON 
THE SHORT LIST, BUT BEFORE HE 
WAS NOMINATED TO THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  IF I UNDERSTOOD YOUR 
TESTIMONY EARLIER, YOU WERE 
MOTIVATED BY A SENSE OF CIVIC 
DUTY AND FRANKLY, A HOPE THAT 
SOME OTHER HIGHLY QUALIFIED 
NOMINEE MIGHT BE PICKED, NOT 
OUT OF A MOTIVATION AT A LATE 
STAGE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE 
FINAL DECISION. 
>>  CORRECT. 
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT 
TO GET THE INFORMATION TO YOU, 
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT 
WHILE THERE WAS STILL A SHORT 
LIST OF CANDIDATES. 
>>  THANK YOU DOCTOR. 
ACCORDING TO JUSTICE DEPARTMENT 
DATA, 2/3 OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
SURVIVORS DON'T REPORT THEIR 
ASSAULTS. 
BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE, I 
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING 
FROM YOU ABOUT THIS BECAUSE YOU 
BORE THIS ALONE. 
YOU BORE THIS ALONE FOR A VERY 
LONG TIME. 
AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US 
TO UNDERSTAND THE WAYS HOW THAT 
IMPACTED YOUR WHOLE LIFE. 
>>  WELL, IT'S IMPACTED ME AT 
DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF MY LIFE. 
THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT WAS 
PROBABLY THE WORST. 
SO THE FIRST FOUR YEARS, I 
THINK I DESCRIBED EARLIER A 
FAIRLY DISASTROUS FIRST TWO 
YEARS OF UNDER GRADUATE STUDIES 
AT UNIVERSITY OF NORTH 
CAROLINA. 
I WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PULL 
MYSELF TOGETHER AND THEN ONCE 
COPING WITH THE IMMEDIATE 
IMPACTS, THE SHORT-TERM 
IMPACTS, I EXPERIENCED LONGER 
TERM IMPACTS OF ANXIETY AND 
RELATIONSHIP CHALLENGES. 
>>  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT. 
AND YET YOU WENT ON TO GET A 
PHD FROM USC, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  AS YOU PREDICTED, THERE WAS 
A WIDE RANGE OF RESPONSES TO 
YOUR COMING FORWARD. 
SOME THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS 
HAVE BEEN MOTIVATED AND 
INSPIRED BY YOUR COURAGE. 
OTHERS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL. 
AND AS I'VE REVIEWED THE WIDE 
RANGE OF REACTIONS, I'VE BEEN 
TROUBLED BY THE EXCUSE OFFERED 
BY TOO MANY. 
THIS WAS A HIGH SCHOOL INCIDENT 
AND BOYS WILL BE BOYS. 
TO ME, THAT IS JUST FAR TOO LOW 
A STANDARD FOR THE CONDUCT OF 
BOYS AND MEN IN OUR COUNTRY. 
IF YOU WOULD, I WOULD 
APPRECIATE YOUR REACTION TO THE 
EXCUSE THAT BOYS WILL BE BOYS. 
>>  I CAN ONLY SPEAK FOR HOW IT 
HAS IMPACTED ME GREATLY FOR THE 
LAST 36 YEARS. 
EVEN THOUGH I WAS 15 YEARS OLD 
AT THE TIME. 
AND I THINK THE YOUNGER YOU ARE 
WHEN THESE THINGS HAPPEN, IT 
CAN POSSIBLY HAVE WORSE IMPACT 
THAN WHEN YOUR BRAIN IS FULLY 
DEVELOPED AND YOU HAVE BETTER 
COPING SKILLS THAT YOU 
DEVELOPED. 
>>  EXPERTS HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT 
HOW IT IS COMMON FOR SEXUAL 
ASSAULT SURVIVORS TO REMEMBER 
SOME FACTS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE 
VERY SHARPLY AND VERY CLEARLY, 
BUT NOT OTHERS. 
THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE 
SURVIVAL MODE THAT WE GO INTO 
IN EXPERIENCING TRAUMA. 
IS THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE AND IS 
THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN HELP THE 
LEI PERSON UNDERSTAND? 
>>  YES. 
I WAS DEFINITELY EXPERIENCING 
THE FIGHT OR FLIGHT MODE, IS 
THAT WHAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO? 
I WAS DEFINITELY EXPERIENCING 
THE SURGE OF ADRENALINE AND 
CORTIZOL AND CREDIT THAT WITH 
THE ABILITY TO GET OUT OF THE 
SITUATION. 
BUT ALSO SOME OTHER LUCKY 
EVENTS THAT OCCURRED THAT 
ALLOWED ME TO GET OUT OF THE 
EVENT. 
>>  DR. FORD, WE ARE GRATEFUL 
THAT YOU CAME THROUGH IT AND 
YOU SHARED YOUR ACCOUNT WITH US 
AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I 
THINK YOU'VE PROVIDED IMPORTANT 
INFORMATIN. 
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
MEETING YOUR CIVIC DUTY. 
I WISH WE COULD HAVE PROVIDED 
FOR YOU A MORE THOROUGH HEARING 
TODAY. 
I THINK ASKING FOR THE FBI TO 
INVESTIGATE THIS MATTER 
THOROUGHLY WAS NOT ASKING TOO 
MUCH. 
I THINK ASKING TO HAVE THE 
OTHER INDIVIDUAL INVOLVED IN 
YOUR ASSAULT, MARK JUDGE, 
APPEAR BEFORE US TODAY, WAS NOT 
ASKING TOO MUCH. 
I AM GRATEFUL YOU CAME FORWARD 
AND GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COURAGE 
THAT SET AN EXAMPLE. 
>>  DR. FORD, WE WERE TALKING 
ABOUT YOU MEETING IN JULY WITH 
CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO. 
DID YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR 
ALLEGATIONS WITH ANY REPUBLICAN 
MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR 
CONGRESSIONAL STAFF? 
>>  I DID NOT. 
WHERE I LIVE, THE CONGRESSWOMAN 
IS A DEMOCRAT. 
>>  OKAY. 
WAS IT COMMUNICATED TO YOU BY 
YOUR COUNSEL OR SOMEONE ELSE 
THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD ASKED TO 
INTERVIEW YOU AND THEY OFFERED 
TO COME OUT TO CALIFORNIA TO DO 
SO? 
>>  WE'RE GOING TO OBJECT, MR. 
CHAIRMAN, TO ANY CALL FOR 
PRIVILEGED CONVERSATIONS 
BETWEEN COUNSEL AND DR. FORD. 
>>  COULD YOU VALIDATE THE FACT 
THAT THE OFFER WAS MADE WITHOUT 
HER SAYING A WORD? 
>>  IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THAT 
QUESTION TO BE ANSWERED WITHOUT 
VIOLATING ANY COUNSEL 
RELATIONSHIPS? 
>>  CAN I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU, 
DO YOU MIND IF I SAY SOMETHING 
TO YOU DIRECTLY? 
I APPRECIATE THAT YOU DID OFFER 
THAT. 
I WASN'T CLEAR ON WHAT THE 
OFFER WAS, IF YOU WERE GOING TO 
COME OUT TO SEE ME, I WOULD 
HAVE HAPPILY HOSTED YOU AND HAD 
BEEN HAPPY TO SPEAK TO YOU OUT 
THERE. 
I WASN'T CLEAR TO BE THAT WAS 
THE CASE. 
>>  OKAY, DOES THAT TAKE CARE 
OF YOUR QUESTION? 
>>  YES. 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
PROCEED THEN. 
>>  BEFORE JULY 30, THE DATE ON 
YOUR LETTER TO SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN, HAD YOU RETAINED 
COUNSEL WITH REGARD TO THESE 
ALLEGATIONS? 
>> NO. 
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WOULD 
NEED LAWYERS, ACTUALLY. 
I DIDN'T KNOW. 
>>  A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT 
FEELING. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LETTER 
THAT YOU WROTE ON JULY 30. 
YOU ASKED SENATOR FEINSTEIN TO 
REMAIN  CONFIDENTIALITY -- 
>>  LET'S WAIT UNTIL SHE FINDS 
IT. 
>>  STOP THE CLOCK, WILL YOU? 
IT'S IN THERE SOME PLACE. 
>>  I FOUND IT. 
>>  YOU ASKED SENATOR FEINSTEIN 
TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY 
UNTIL WE HAVE HAD FURTHER 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. 
AND THEN SAID YOU WERE 
AVAILABLE TO SPEAK FURTHER 
VACATIONING IN THE MID ATLANTIC 
UNTIL AUGUST 7. IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>>  THE LAST LINE, IS THAT WHAT 
YOU ARE REFERRING -- SORRY, I'M 
A LITTLE SLOWER. 
MY MIND IS GETTING TIRED. 
I'M AVAILABLE TO SPEAK FURTHER 
IF YOU WISH TO DISCUSS. 
YES, I WAS IN DELAWARE UNTIL 
AUGUST 7. AND AFTER THAT I WENT 
TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THEN BACK 
TO CALIFORNIA. 
>>  DID YOU TALK WITH ANYBODY 
ABOUT THIS LETTER BEFORE YOU 
SENT IT? 
>>  I TALKED WITH ANNA ESHOO'S 
OFFICE. 
>>  OKAY. 
WHY DID YOU TALK TO 
CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO'S OFFICE 
ABOUT THAT LETTER? 
>>  BECAUSE THEY WERE WILLING 
TO HAND DELIVER IT TO SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN. 
>>  OKAY. 
DID ANYONE HELP YOU WRITE THE 
LETTER? 
>>  NO. 
>>  OKAY. 
AFTER YOU SENT YOUR LETTER, DID 
YOU OR ANYONE ON YOUR BEHALF 
SPEAK TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN 
PERSONALLY OR WITH ANY SENATE 
STAFFER? 
>>  YES. 
I HAD A PHONE CALL WITH SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN. 
>>  OKAY. 
WHEN WAS THAT? 
>>  THAT WAS WHILE I WAS STILL 
IN DELAWARE. 
SO BEFORE AUGUST 7. 
>>  OKAY. 
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU SPEAK 
WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN? 
>>  ONCE. 
>>  OKAY. 
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT? 
>>  SHE ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THE INCIDENT. 
I ANSWERED THOSE QUESTIONS. 
>>  WAS THAT THE EXTENT, THE 
GIST OF THE CONVERSATION? 
>>  IT WAS A BRIEF PHONE CALL. 
>>  OKAY. 
DID YOU EVER GIVE SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN OR ANYONE ELSE THE 
PERMISSION TO RELEASE THAT 
LETTER? 
>>  NOT THAT I KNOW OF. 
NO. 
>>  OKAY. 
BETWEEN THE LETTER DATE, JULY 
30 AND AUGUST 7, DID YOU SPEAK 
WITH ANY OTHER PERSON ABOUT 
YOUR ALLEGATIONS? 
>>  COULD YOU SAY THE DATES 
AGAIN. 
>>  BETWEEN THE LETTER DATE OF 
JULY 30 AND AUGUST 7, SO WHILE 
YOU WERE STILL IN DELAWARE, DID 
YOU SPEAK WITH ANY OTHER PERSON 
ABOUT YOUR ALLEGATIONS? 
>>  JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER 
WHAT DATES. 
>>  YOU'RE ASKING HER WITH ANY 
LAWYERS SHE COULD HAVE SPOKEN 
WITH, CORRECT? 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  CORRECT. 
I THINK CORRECT. 
I WAS INTERVIEWING LAWYERS. 
I WAS NOT SPEAKING PERSONALLY 
ABOUT IT. 
>>  ASIDE FROM LAWYERS THAT YOU 
WERE SEEKING TO POSSIBLY HIRE 
TO REPRESENT YOU, DID YOU SPEAK 
TO ANYBODY ELSE ABOUT IT DURING 
THAT PERIOD OF TIME? 
>>  NO. 
>>  OKAY. 
>>  I WAS STAYING WITH MY 
PARENTS AT THE TIME. 
>>  DID YOU TALK TO THEM ABOUT 
IT? 
>>  DEFINITELY NOT. 
>>  SO, WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY 
YOU RETAINED COUNSEL DURING 
THAT TIME PERIOD OF JULY 30 TO 
AUGUST 7? 
>>  I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT 
DATE, BUT I WAS INTERVIEWING úL 
TIME SITTING IN THE CAR, IN THE 
DRIVEWAY, AND IN THE WALGREEN'S 
PARKING LOT IN DELAWARE. 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE 
WHOLE SYSTEM WORKS OF 
INTERVIEWING LAWYERS AND HOW TO 
PICK ONE, ETCETERA. 
>>  YOU TESTIFIED EARLIER THAT 
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE NEED FOR 
LAWYERS. 
NOW YOU ARE TRYING TO HIRE 
THEM. 
WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND? 
>>  IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THE 
INDIVIDUALS THAT I HAD TOLD, 
THE TOTAL NUMBER, THE TOTAL WAS 
NOT VERY HIGH. 
BUT THOSE PERSONS ADVISED ME TO 
AT THIS POINT, GET A LAWYER FOR 
ADVICE ABOUT WHETHER TO PUSH 
FORWARD OR TO STAY BACK. 
>>  DID THAT INCLUDE 
CONGRESSWOMAN ESHOO AND SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN? 
>>  NO. 
>>  I WANT TO THANK DR. FORD úF 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE HAD SAID 
WE WOULD COME TO CALIFORNIA. 
SENATOR BLOOMINGTHAL. 
>>  THANKS, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I WANT TO JOIN IN THANKING YOU 
FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND TELL 
YOU I HAVE FOUND YOUR TESTIMONY 
POWERFUL AND CREDIBLE AND I 
BELIEVE YOU. 
YOU ARE A TEACHER, CORRECT? 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  YOU HAVE GIVEN AMERICA AN 
AMAZING TEACHING MOMENT AND YOU 
MAY HAVE OTHER MOMENTS IN THE 
CLASSROOM, BUT YOU HAVE 
INSPIRED AND YOU HAVE 
ENLIGHTENED AMERICA. 
YOU HAVE INSPIRED AND GIVEN 
COURAGE TO WOMEN TO COME 
FORWARD AS THEY HAVE DONE TO 
EVERY ONE OF OUR OFFICES AND 
MANY OTHER PUBLIC PLACES. 
YOU HAVE INSPIRED AND YOU HAVE 
ENLIGHTENED MEN. 
IN AMERICA. 
THAT IS A PROFOUND PUBLIC 
SERVICE REGARDLESS OF WHAT 
HAPPENS WITH THIS NOMINATION. 
AND SO THE TEACHERS OF AMERICA, 
PEOPLE OF AMERICA SHOULD BE 
REALLY PROUD OF WHAT YOU HAVE 
DONE. 
LET ME TELL YOU WHY I BELIEVE 
YOU. 
NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE PRIOR 
CONSISTENT STATEMENTS AND THE 
POLYGRAPH TEST AND YOUR REQUEST 
FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION AND 
YOUR URGING THAT THIS COMMITTEE 
HEAR FROM OTHER WITNESSES WHO 
COULD CORROBORATE OR DISPUTE 
YOUR STORY. 
BUT ALSO YOU HAD BEEN VERY 
HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU CANNOT 
REMEMBER. 
AND SOMEONE COMPOSING A STORY 
CAN MAKE IT ALL COME TOGETHER 
IN A SEAMLESS WAY. 
SOMEONE WHO IS HONEST, I SPEAK 
FROM MY EXPERIENCE AS A 
PROSECUTOR AS WELL, IS ALSO -- 
ABOUT WHAT HE OR SHE CANNOT 
REMEMBER. 
THE SENATORS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
OF THE AISLE HAVE BEEN SILENT. 
THIS PROCEDURE IS UNPRECEDENTED 
IN A CONFIRMATION HEARING. 
BUT I WANT TO QUOTE ONE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES, SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM, IN A BOOK THAT HE WROTE 
IN 2015, WHEN HE WAS DESCRIBING 
HIS OWN SERVICE. 
VERY DISTINGUISHED SERVICE. 
I'M NOT UNDER OATH. 
HE SAID QUOTE, OF HIS 
PROSECUTIONS OF RAPE CASES, I 
LEARNED HOW MUCH UNEXPECTED 
COURAGE FROM A DEEP AND HIDDEN 
PLACE IT TAKES FOR A RAPE 
VICTIM OR A SEXUALLY ABUSED 
CHILD TO TESTIFY AGAINST THEIR 
ASSAILANT. 
I LEARNED HOW MUCH COURAGE FROM 
A DEEP AND HIDDEN PLACE IT 
TAKES FOR A RAPE VICTIM OR 
SEXUALLY ABUSED CHILD TO 
TESTIFY AGAINST THEIR 
ASSAILANT. 
IF WE AGREE ON NOTHING ELSE 
TODAY, I HOPE ON A BIPARTISAN 
BASIS, WE CAN AGREE ON HOW MUCH 
COURAGE IT HAS TAKEN FOR YOU TO 
COME FORWARD AND I THINK YOU 
HAVE EARNED AMERICA'S 
GRATITUDE. 
NOW, THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK 
ABOUT YOUR REQUESTING AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
YOU MENTIONED A POINT JUST A 
FEW MINUTES AGO THAT YOU COULD 
BETTER ESTIMATE THE TIME THAT 
YOU RAN INTO MARK JUDGE IF YOU 
KNEW THE TIME THAT HE WAS 
WORKING AT THAT SUPERMARKET. 
THAT'S A FACT THAT COULD BE 
UNCOVERED BY AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION THAT WOULD HELP 
FURTHER -- YOUR ACCOUNT. 
WOULD YOU LIKE MARK JUDGE TO BE 
INTERVIEWED IN CONNECTION WITH 
THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION 
AND THE SERIOUS CREDIBLE 
ALLEGATIONS THAT YOU'VE MADE? 
>>  THAT WOULD BE MY 
PREFERENCE. 
I'M NOT SURE IT'S UP TO ME. 
I CERTAINLY WOULD FEEL LIKE I 
COULD BE MORE HELPFUL TO 
EVERYONE IF I KNEW THE DATE 
THAT HE WORKED AT THE SAFEWAY 
SO THAT I COULD GIVE A MORE 
SPECIFIC DATE OF THE ASSAULT. 
>>  IT'S NOT UP TO YOU. 
IT'S UP TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 
HIS FAILURE TO ASK FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION, IN MY VIEW, IS A 
COVERUP. 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>>  SENATOR FLAKE. 
>>  THANK YOU. 
WE'VE HEARD THIS MORNING 
SEVERAL TIMES THAT YOU DID TAKE 
A POLYGRAPH. 
THAT WAS ON AUGUST 7. IS THAT 
RIGHT? 
>>  I BELIEVE SO. 
THE DAY I WAS FLYING FROM BWI 
TO MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
>>  OKAY. 
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO TAKE A 
POLYGRAPH? 
>>  I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON NOT 
TO DO IT. 
>>  WERE YOU ADVISED TO DO 
THAT? 
>>  AGAIN, YOU ARE SEEMING TO 
CALL FOR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN 
COUNSEL AND CLIENT. 
I DON'T THINK YOU MEAN TO DO 
THAT. 
IF YOU DO, SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE 
TO ANSWER THAT. 
>>  CONSOLE, COULD YOU LET HER 
ANSWER THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
DOESN'T VIOLATE THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND 
DR. FORD. 
>>  BASED ON THE ADVICE OF THE 
COUNSEL, I WAS HAPPY TO UNDERGO 
THE POLYGRAPH TEST, ALTHOUGH I 
FOUND IT EXTREMELY STRESSFUL. 
MUCH LONGER THAN I ANTICIPATED. 
I TOLD MY WHOLE LIFE STORY, I 
FELT LIKE. 
I ENDURED IT. 
IT WAS FINE. 
>>  I UNDERSTAND THEY CAN BE 
THAT WAY. 
HAVE YOU EVER TAKEN ANY OTHER 
POLYGRAPHS IN YOUR LIFE? 
>>  NEVER. 
>>  OKAY. 
YOU WENT TO SEE A GENTLEMAN BY 
THE NAME OF JEREMIAH TO SERVE 
AS THE PA LIG PALIGRAPHER. 
DID ANYONE ADVISE YOU ON THAT 
CHOICE? 
>>  YES. 
I BELIEVE HIS NAME WAS JERRY. 
>>  JERRY HANAFEN. 
>>  YES. 
DID ANYONE ADVISE YOU ON THAT 
CHOICE? 
>>  YEAH, I DIDN'T CHOOSE HIM 
MYSELF. 
HE WAS THE PERSON THAT CAME TO 
DO THE POLYGRAPH TEST. 
>>  HE ACTUALLY CONDUCTED THE 
POLYGRAPH NOT IN HIS OFFICE IN 
VIRGINIA, BUT ACTUALLY AT THE 
HOTEL NEXT TO BALTIMORE 
WASHINGTON AIRPORT. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  WHY WAS THAT LOCATION MADE? 
>>  I HAD LEFT MY GRANDMOTHER'S 
FUNERAL THAT DAY AND WAS ON 
TIGHT SCHEDULE TO GET A PLANE 
TO MANCHESTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
SO HE WAS WILLING TO COME TO 
ME, WHICH WAS APPRECIATED. 
>>  SO HE ADMINISTERED A 
POLYGRAPH ON THE DAY THAT YOU 
ATTENDED YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S 
FUNERAL? 
>>  CORRECT. 
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NEXT 
DAY. 
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN A HOTEL. 
I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT DAY. 
>>  HAVE YOU EVER HAD 
DISCUSSIONS WITH ANYONE BESIDES 
YOUR ATTORNEYS ON HOW TO TAKE A 
POLYGRAPH? 
>>  NEVER. 
>>  I DON'T JUST MEAN 
COUNTERMEASURES, BUT I MEAN 
JUST ANY SORT OF TIPS OR 
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. 
>>  NO. 
I WAS SCARED OF THE TEST 
ITSELF, BUT WAS COMFORTABLE 
THAT I COULD TELL THE 
INFORMATION AND THE TEST WOULD 
REVEAL WHATEVER IT WAS GOING TO 
REVEAL. 
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE AS 
LONG AS IT WAS GOING TO BE. 
IT WAS A LITTLE BIT STRESSFUL. 
>>  HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN TIPS OR 
ADVICE TO SOMEONE WHO WAS 
LOOKING TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH 
TEST? 
>>  NEVER. 
>>  OKAY. 
DID YOU PAY FOR THE POLYGRAPH 
YOURSELF? 
>>  I DON'T THINK SO. 
>>  DO YOU KNOW WHO DID PAY FOR 
THE POLYGRAPH? 
>>  NOT YET, NO.
>>  YOU HAVE THE HANDWRITTEN 
STATEMENT THAT YOU WROTE OUT. 
DID ANYONE ASSIST YOU IN 
WRITING THAT STATEMENT? 
>>  NO. 
YOU CAN TELL HOW ANXIOUS I WAS 
BY THE TERRIBLE HANDWRITING. 
>>  DID YOU -- WE TOUCHED ON IT 
EARLIER. 
DID YOU KNOW THE COMMITTEE 
REQUESTED NOT ONLY THE CHART 
FROM THE POLYGRAPH TEST, BUT 
ALSO ANY AUDIO OR VIDEO 
RECORDING OF THE POLYGRAPH 
TEST. 
>>  NO. 
>>  WERE YOU AUDIO AND VIDEO 
RECORDED WHEN YOU WERE TAKING 
THAT TEST? 
>>  OKAY. 
I REMEMBER BEING HOOKED UP TO A 
MACHINE, LIKE BEING PLACED ON 
TO MY BODY AND BEING ASKED A 
LOT OF QUESTIONS AND CRYING A 
LOT. 
THAT'S MY PRIMARY MEMORY OF 
THAT TEST. 
I KNOW HE TOOK DETAIL INTO 
EXPLANING WHAT HE WAS GOING TO 
BE DOING, BUT I WAS JUST 
FOCUSED ON WHAT I WAS GOING TO 
SAY AND MY FEAR ABOUT THAT. 
I WASN'T LISTENING TO EVERY 
DETAIL ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS 
AUDIO OR VIDEO RECORDED. 
>>  YOU WERE IN A HOTEL ROOM, 
RIGHT? 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  REGULAR HOTEL ROOM WITH A 
BED AND BATHROOM? 
>>  NO. 
IT WAS A CONFERENCE ROOM. 
I WAS SITTING AT A CHAIR AND HE 
WAS BEHIND ME. 
>>  DID YOU NOTE ANY CAMERAS IN 
THE ROOM? 
>>  HE HAD A COMPUTER SET UP. 
SO I GUESS I ASSUME HE WAS 
SOMEHOW TAPING AND RECORDING 
ME. 
>>  OKAY. 
SO YOU ASSUMED YOU WERE BEING 
VIDEO AND AUDIO RECORDED. 
>>  CORRECT. 
>>  BUT YOU DON'T KNOW FOR 
SURE. 
>>  I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. 
>>  OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  WE'RE GOING TO RECESS NOW 
FOR HALF HOUR FOR LUNCH. 
THANK YOU DR. FORD. 
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING THE CBS 
NEWS COVERAGE OF THE KAVANAUGH 
HEARINGS LIVE FROM CAPITOL 
HILL. 
THEY ARE JUST NOW TAKING A 
BREAK AT THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE HEARINGS. 
CHAIRMAN CHUCK GRASSLEY JUST 
ANNOUNCED A RECESS. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD HAS BEEN 
TESTIFYING FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS 
ABOUT HER ALLEGATION THAT 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE, BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
HER IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
>>  WE HAVE HEARD A SERIES OF 
QUESTIONS FOR MORE THAN HALF OF 
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS. 
RACHEL MITCHELL IS QUESTIONING 
THE WITNESS. 
BLASEY FORD TESTIFIED SHE IS 
100% SURE AND SHE SAID THAT A 
COUPLE TIMES. 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH ATTACKED 
HER. 
JEFF GLOR JOINS US AT THE 
TABLE. 
WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU FIRST? 
>>  IT'S BEEN THE CONTINUOUS 
SWING, GAYLE, BETWEEN THESE BIG 
EMOTIONAL SWEEPING STATEMENTS 
WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND THEN 
RACHEL MITCHELL QUESTIONING ON 
BEHALF OF THE REPUBLICANS IN 
THIS VERY MICROLEVEL STEP BY 
STEP, ALMOST A STERILE SORT OF 
QUESTIONING. 
THAT CONTINUES TO BE, I THINK, 
ONE OF THE BIG THEMES HERE. 
THE OTHER ONE THAT IS 
DEVELOPING, YOU ARE HEARING, 
WE'RE GOING TO SEE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH LATER THIS AFTERNOON. 
THE OTHER NAME YOU ARE HEARING, 
MARK JUDGE. 
WHERE IS MARK JUDGE? 
>>  RACHEL MICHELLE APPEARS TO 
BE TRYING TO GO SOMEWHERE. 
I'M NOT SURE WHERE SHE'S GOING. 
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HER DEMEANOR, 
DR. FORD'S DEMEANOR, HER TONE, 
HER DEMEANOR SEEMS TO BE, HOW 
CAN I HELP? 
WHAT DO YOU NEED FROM ME? 
THERE'S NOTHING EVASIVE ABOUT 
HER TESTIMONY. 
SHE WANTED AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION, LAST TIME I 
CHECKED, ANYBODY WHO HAS 
SOMETHING TO HIDE IS NO THE 
ASKING FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
>>  AND IT GOES TO THE NATURE 
OF THE WAY THEY HAVE OUTLINED 
THIS WHOLE PROCESS. 
THEY HAVE HER DO IT IN THESE 
FIVE MINUTE INCRIMINATES. 
YOU FEEL LIKE SHE'S DOING A 
WITNESS INTERVIEW AS OPPOSED TO 
CROSS EXAMINING SOMEONE IN A 
COURTROOM AND ASKING FOR FACTS 
AND TRYING TO FLUSH OUT THE 
FACTS OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT 
DAY. 
SHE GETS ALONG A LINE OF 
QUESTIONING, THE FIVE MINUTES 
ARE UP AND IT GOES ELSEWHERE. 
IT'S HARD TO SEE WHERE SHE MAY 
BE GOING WITH THIS. 
MAYBE THIS IS KIND OF FLUSHING 
OUT SOME OF THE RECORD TO 
SUGGEST, I DO THINK THEY ARE 
LAYING SOME OF HER QUESTIONS. 
SHE'S LAYING GROUNDWORK. 
EVEN THOUGH SHE SAYS SHE IS 
100% SURE. 
IT IS POSSIBLE SHE DID 
MISREMEMBER THIS EVENT AND MAY 
BE OTHER WITNESSES. 
YOU SAW HER CONTRADICT THE 
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE AT THE PARTY. 
SOME OF THE STATEMENTS SHE GAVE 
TO THE WASHINGTON POST ARE 
DIFFERENT. 
AND SUGGESTING SHE CAME FORWARD 
EARLY ON, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T 
WANT HIM TO BE THE NOMINEE. 
AND THEN DEMOCRATS -- 
>>  WHEN HE WAS ON THE SHORT 
LIST. 
>>  AND YOU SEE THIS, DEMOCRATS 
SAID ON THAT TO MANIPULATE HER. 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE 
SEEING. 
IT'S HARD TO SEE WHERE SHE'S 
GOING WITH SOME OF THIS. 
>>  NORA HAS BEEN LEADING OUR 
COVERAGE FROM CAPITOL HILL. 
NORA, WHAT IS YOUR BIG TAKE 
AWAY FROM THIS SECOND ROUND OF 
TESTIMONY? 
>>  TO FOLLOW OEN WHAT JAN IS 
TALKING ABOUT, I THINK WHAT YOU 
SEE IS THE GENTLE, BUT POINTED 
QUESTIONING FROM THE SPECIAL 
PROSECUTOR WHO IS REPRESENTING 
THE REPUBLICAN. 
I DON'T KNOW THAT SHE IS IN 
DOUBT, BUT ASKING MORE SPECIFIC 
QUESTIONING THAT GO TO THIS 
QUESTION OF CREDIBILITY. 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN 
TALKING FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING. 
SPECIFICALLY, SHE ASKED THE 
QUESTION ABOUT THE THERAPIST 
NOTES. 
REMEMBER THAT THE FIRST 
CORROBORATING ACCOUNT WAS THAT 
SHE TALKED ABOUT THIS WITH HER 
THERAPIST IN 2012 WHEN SHE WENT 
FOR MARRIAGE COUNSELING. 
SO THE QUESTION WAS, DID YOU 
NAME BRETT KAVANAUGH THEN IN 
2012? 
SHE SAID NO. 
WHEN SHE TOLD HER HUSBAND, 
BEFORE THEY WERE MARRIED THAT 
SHE EXPERIENCED A SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, DID SHE TELL HER 
HUSBAND AT THE TIME THE NAME, 
THE IDENTITY OF THE PERSON, NO. 
JUST A QUESTION. 
WHY, WHY NOT? 
WHY DIDN'T SHE NAME HIS NAME? 
SHE'S JUST GETTING TO THAT. 
A QUESTION TO RAISE WHAT MAY BE 
DOUBTS TO ADD TO THE STORY LINE 
THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED. 
THE OTHER QUESTION I THINK THAT 
I WAS LOOKING BACK CLOSELY, THE 
QUESTION OF THE MAP. 
WHY POINT OUT THE DISTANCE 
BETWEEN COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB, 
WHERE THE HOUSE WAS, AND WHERE 
CHRISTINE BLASEY LIVED WHEN SHE 
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
THE MAP SHOWED ESSENTIALLY A 
DISTANCE. 
IT'S ABOUT 8.2 MILES BETWEEN 
HER HOUSE AND COLUMBIA COUNTRY 
CLUB. 
IT'S ABOUT 6.2 MILES BETWEEN 
HER HOUSE AND WHERE THIS 
ALLEGED ASSAULT TOOK PLACE. 
AFTER YOU ARE ASSAULTED, HOW 
DID YOU GET HOME? 
WOULD YOU HAVE REMEMBERED THAT? 
WHY DIDN'T YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU 
GOT HOME? 
YOU KNOW. 
THAT KIND OF LINE OF 
QUESTIONING, IT'S JUST ADDING 
TO THIS STORY LINE ABOUT 
REMEMBERING THAT EVENT. 
I THINK SHE'S JUST, LIKE YOU 
GUYS SAID, IT'S HARD TO SEE 
WHERE THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IS 
GOING, EXCEPT SHE SEEMS TO BE 
SLOWLY TRYING TO STITCH 
SOMETHING TOGETHER. 
THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS IT OR 
IS IT JUST KNICKS IN HER 
CREDIBILITY? 
>>  ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT 
EACH TIME AS NORA OUTLINED, 
SOME QUESTIONING HAVE BEEN 
ASKED, IS THEN INTERRUPTED BY 
CHARACTER WITNESSES BY THE 
DEMOCRATS AND THE VERY 
TESTIMONY OF DR. FORD HERSELF. 
AND SO IF SOMEBODY IS WEIGHING 
IN THIS THE COURT OF PUBLIC 
OPINION, THIS IS NOT A COURT. 
IT'S A POLITICAL EVENT. 
THEY ARE SEEING ANSWERS BY A 
WITNESS WHO IS TRYING TO BE 
VERY SPECIFIC, EVEN THE 
ADJECTIVES, SHE IS TRYING TO BE 
HELPFUL, AS YOU SAID, GAYLE, 
AND THAT IS BEING WEIGHED 
AGAINST SMALL QUESTIONS HERE 
AND THERE. 
THERE IS CONTEMPORANEOUS 
READINGS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE 
ABOUT HER CHARACTER AS OPPOSED 
TO DOUBTS THAT MIGHT HAVE 
HAPPENED. 
>>  THEY ARE TRYING TO CONDUCT 
A LEGAL AND POLITICAL EVENT AT 
THE SAME TIME. 
IT'S WORTH, AS YOU GUYS HAVE 
MENTIONED, IT'S WORTH ASKING 
THE QUESTION WHETHER THERE MAY 
NOT BE THIS AH-HA MOMENT. 
SHE IS DELIBERATELY GOING 
THROUGH ALL OF THIS. 
I THINK THERE'S AN EXPECTATION 
SOME HAVE THAT SHE'S TRYING TO 
REACH SOME CRESCENDO. 
I THINK IT'S WORTH ASKING THE 
QUESTION OF WHETHER SHE'LL 
CONTINUE ALONG AT THIS PACE TO 
ASK THESE QUESTIONS OF 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 
>>  THE MORE YOU HEAR DR. FORD 
SPEAK, THE MORE YOU THINK THAT 
SHE IS DOING EVERYTHING SHE CAN 
TO HELP. 
SHE'S NOT BEING EVASIVE. 
SHE'S SIMPLE ABOUT HER PROCESS. 
SHE SAID ALL ALONG. 
I JUST WANTED TO DO MY CIVIC 
DUTY. 
SHE TALKS ABOUT HER BEACH 
FRIENDS WHO GAVE HER ADVICE TO 
GET THIS INTO THE PUBLIC 
ATMOSPHERE. 
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO THE 
MEDIA. 
HER BEACH FRIENDS SUGGESTED 
THAT YOU GO TO YOUR 
CONGRESSWOMAN. 
YOU GO TO YOUR CONGRESSPERSON 
AND GET IT OUT THAT WAY. 
AND THEN AFTER SHE WENT TO HER 
BEACH FRIENDS, SHE IS SITTING 
IN A PARKING LOT IN  WALGREEN'S 
TRYING TO PICK A LAWYER. 
THERE WAS NOTHING SOPHISTICATED 
OR STRATEGIC IN HOW SHE WAS 
TRYING TO GET THIS TO THE 
PUBLIC DOMAIN. 
>>  AND I THINK WHEN YOU THINK 
ABOUT KIND OF SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT NORA LAYED OUT, 
REALLY INTERESTING CLUES OF 
WHERE RACHEL MITCHELL MAY BE 
GOING WITH THIS. 
OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS DID NOT 
WANT TO REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED IN 
1991, WHERE THEY WERE SEEN AS 
GRILLING ANITA HILL. 
SO THIS IS HOW THIS ALL CAME 
ABOUT. 
THEY WILL HAVE THIS SEASONED 
PROSECUTOR FROM OUTSIDE OF 
WASHINGTO, D.C. ASK THE 
QUESTIONS. 
AND YOU KNOW, I THINK JUST 
BASED ON SOME OF THE SOURCES 
I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM, IF 
YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN SENATOR, 
YOU'RE NOT SO UNHAPPY WITH HOW 
THIS IS GOING RIGHT NOW, 
BECAUSE DESPITE LINDSEY GRAHAM 
JUMPING IN, THEY ARE NOT 
SITTING THERE ANSWERING THE 
QUESTIONING. 
OR THE COMMITTEE, OR FORD 
HERSELF. 
WHO THIS LOOKS VERY FAIR TO THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
BUT THE QUESTION IS, IT'S NOT 
REALLY A CROSS EXAM IN ADDITION 
THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT. 
SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR 
BRETT KAVANAUGH? 
WHO WILL PUT THESE DOTS 
TOGETHER? 
WHEN WILL THE SENATORS SAY, WE 
HAVE THIS ABOUT THE MAP, WE 
HAVE THIS ABOUT LOUD MUSIC, BUT 
IT WAS QUIET DOWNSTAIRS. 
WHY WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND NOT 
THINK IT WAS WEIRD SHE HEARD 
LOUD MUSIC. 
WHO WILL PUT THOSE DOTS 
TOGETHER? 
WE DON'T KNOW THAT. 
>>  I UNDERSTAND ED O'KEIF WILL 
JOIN US. 
>>  THIS WOMAN IS HAVING TO 
TELL HER STORY TO AMERICA. 
AND SHE IS DOING AN 
EXTRAORDINARY JOB IN RECALLING 
WHAT SHE CAN AND STANDING UP TO 
THE QUESTIONS FROM A 
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR AND I 
AM PROUD OF HOW SHE'S DOING. 
>>  CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
EMOTION IN THE ROOM? 
>>  WELL, FOR ME, THE MEMORY OF 
SO MANY WOMEN THAT HAVE COME 
FORWARD IN MY OLD JOB. 
I SAW WOMEN LIKE HER COME 
FORWARD AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS 
EASY AT ALL. 
AND SHE CLEARLY WAS TRYING TO 
KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL. 
SHE STRUGGLED WITH WHAT TO DO. 
WHEN THE REPORTER SHOWED UP AT 
HER DOORSTEP, AS SHE FINALLY 
DECIDED THAT SHE COULDN'T KEEP 
SILENT AND SHE CAME FORWARD. 
>>  IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'VE 
HEARD SO FAR THIS MORNING THAT 
POTENTIALLY CHANGES WHAT YOU 
WANT TO ASK OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
LATER TODAY? 
>>  I DON'T THINK SO. 
SHE HAS BEEN VERY SOLID. 
I THINK TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AS 
MOST OF AMERICA MUST BE 
FRUSTRATED THAT WE DON'T HAVE 
THAT FBI BACKGROUND CHECK 
REOPENED. 
SHE SAID SHE COULD BETTER 
RECALL THE TIME PERIOD IF SHE 
KNEW WHEN MARK JUDGE WORKED AT 
THE SAFEWAY AND HE IS HIDING 
OUT AT A BEACH HOUSE IN 
DELAWARE AND SHE IS SIMPLY 
TRYING TO GET THAT INFORMATION 
AND THE FBI COULD OPEN THAT UP 
AT THE REQUEST OF THE PRESIDENT 
OR THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
ASKING THE PRESIDENT TO OPEN IT 
UP. 
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. 
I THOUGHT THE OTHER INTERESTING 
THING WAS THAT THERE APPEARED 
TO BE SOME INITIAL OBJECTION TO 
PUTTING THE POLYGRAPH TEST IN 
WHEN THAT IS USED ALL THE TIME 
BY THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, BY 
THE FBI, BY THE CIA. 
THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW FOR THE 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND. 
WE'RE SIMPLY TRYING TO PUT IN 
SOME RECORDS THAT SHOW HER 
TRUTHFULNESS. 
>>  WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THOSE 
MAPS, DO YOU THINK? 
>>  I DON'T KNOW. 
I GUESS WE WILL HAVE TO FIND 
OUT. 
SHE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION 
HONESTLY. 
>>  WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT 
RACHEL MITCHELL -- 
>>  WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE 
OVERALL MOVEMENT? 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OTHER 
VICTIMS OF  SEXUAL ASSAULT WHEN 
SHE TESTIFIES LIKE THIS? 
>>  AS I SAID FOR SO LONG, 
THESE KINDS OF CASES HAVE BEEN 
SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. 
THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN A HOUSE 
WERE NOT ALLOWED TO BE IN A 
COURTHOUSE. 
THAT'S DIFFERENT TODAY. 
THEY ARE IN THE COURTHOUSE OF 
AMERICA AND THEY WILL MAKE A 
DECISION. 
THEY WILL HELP, I HOPE, MY 
COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE AISLE TO MAKE A DECISION 
ABOUT WHO IS GOING TO SERVE IN 
THE HIGHEST COURTHOUSE OF THE 
LAND. 
ONE LAST THING. 
>>  THERE YOU HAVE SENATOR AMY, 
FORMER PROSECUTOR HERSELF. 
ALSO AS A GRADUATE OF YALE 
UNIVERSITY TALKING ABOUT WHAT 
SHE SAW. 
SHE PUT INTO THE RECORD THE 
RESULTS OF THAT POLYGRAPH TEST. 
BUT AS YOU SEE HERE, EACH SIDE 
IS DUG IN ON US AND IT'S NOT 
CLEAR THAT ANYONE THERE ON THAT 
COMMITTEE HAS CHANGED THEIR 
VIEW. 
THAT'S QUITE FRANKLY NOT REALLY 
WHO IT IS DIRECTED TO. 
IT'S SOME OF THESE MODERATE 
SENATORS WHO WILL DECIDE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S VOTE. 
A COUPLE PIECES OF INFORMATION, 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAVE BEEN 
WATCHING ALL OF THIS, INCLUDING 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS 
TESTIMONY BY DR. FORD. 
WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS WATCHED HER 
TESTIMONY. 
HE HAS JUST RECENTLY LEFT HIS 
HOME UP IN MARYLAND TO HEAD 
DOWN HERE TO CAPITOL HILL FOR 
HIS PART OF THE TESTIMONY WHERE 
HE WILL HAVE TO ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION ABOUT HIS OWN 
CHARACTER, ABOUT HIS OWN 
CREDIBILITY, AS DR. FORD HAS 
SAID SHE IS 100% SURE THAT IT 
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER MORE 
THAN 36 YEARS AGO. 
NANCY CORDES AND I HAVE BEEN 
SITTING HIP TO HIP WATCHING 
THESE HEARINGS. 
EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SO 
FAR. 
WHAT HAS STOOD OUT TO YOU? 
>>  I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING 
IS THAT RACHEL MITCHELL, THE 
PROSECUTOR WHO IS WORKING ON 
BEHALF OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
REPUBLICANS IS CLEARLY TRYING 
TO POKE HOLES GENTLY IN 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD'S 
CREDIBILITY. 
ASKING HER, FOR EXAMPLE, AFTER 
BLASEY FORD SAID ONE OF THE 
LASTING IMPACTS OF THIS TRAUMA 
IS SHE HAS A FEAR OF ENCLOSED 
SPACES. 
SHE WANTED TWO FRONT DOORS TO 
HER HOUSE, WHICH IS NOT 
PLEASING FROM THE STREET. 
>>  SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO FLY. 
SO THEN YOU HEARD THE 
PROSECUTOR SAY, WELL WHY IS IT 
THEN THAT YOU HAVE TRAVELED TO 
THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND COSTA 
RICA AND HAWAII TO SURF? 
AND WHAT BLASEY FORD SAID WAS 
THAT IT'S A LOT EASIER FOR ME 
TO FLY ON VACATION THAN IT IS 
TO COME BACK HERE TO THE EAST 
COAST. 
I ONLY DO IT ONCE A YEAR. 
IT'S AN APPROACH LIKE THAT, 
RESPECTFUL, NOT 
CONFRONTATIONAL, THIS IS NOT 12 
ANGRY MEN, BUT STILL TRYING TO 
FIND HOLES IN HER STORY AND IN 
HER CREDIBILITY. 
>>  SO THEN HERE'S THE QUESTION 
FROM A POLITICAL STANDPOINT, 
WHICH IS THAT WHILE RACHEL HAS 
PERHAPS HELPED THE REPUBLICANS, 
BECAUSE SHE HAS DONE VERY 
CAREFUL POINTED QUESTIONS IN A 
SERIOUS AND PROFESSIONAL WAY. 
HAS IT BENEFITED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH? 
HAS IT BENEFITED THOSE IN THE 
KAVANAUGH CAMP? 
THOSE IN THE WHITE HOUSE? 
SPECIFICALLY THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES THAT BELIEVE 
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TOUGH ENOUGH 
PUSHING BACK ON THIS PARTICULAR 
WITNESS ACCOUNT. 
>>  I THINK SHE IS ABLE TO LOOK 
FOR THOSE CREDIBILITY GAPS IN A 
MORE SUSTAINED WAY THAN A BUNCH 
OF REPUBLICAN SENATORS ALL 
COMING LOADED WOULD BE ABLE TO. 
SHE IS GOING METHODICALLY 
THROUGH BLASEY FORD'S 
BACKGROUND, THROUGH HER STORY. 
YOU DIDN'T ORIGINALLY WANT TO 
HIRE A LAWYER. 
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO HIRE A 
LAWYER? 
IN A LOT OF THESE CASES, FORD 
HAS BELIEVABLE ANSWERS. 
WELL, AT FIRST I NEVER BEEN IN 
A SITUATION LIKE THIS. 
I DIDN'T THINK I NEEDED A 
LAWYER. 
BUT THEN ALL MY FRIENDS ON THE 
BEACH STARTED SAYING, YOU 
SHOULD GET A LAWYER. 
WHY DID YOU GET A POLYGRAPH? 
I WAS TOLD THAT WOULD BE A GOOD 
IDEA. 
WHICH FROM A 51-YEAR-OLD MOTHER 
OF TWO, SHE ANSWERS THOSE 
QUESTIONS LIKE MY FRIENDS TOLD 
ME IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA. 
SHE HAS REASONABLE EXPLANATIONS 
ONE MIGHT SAY TO THESE ANSWERS. 
>>  YES. 
IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN AND 
YOU'RE LOOKING POLITICALLY FOR 
A REASON TO SAY, NO, EVEN AFTER 
ALL OF THIS, EVEN THOUGH SHE 
GAVE CREDIBLE ANSWERS, I STILL 
BELIEVE JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THEY ARE LOOKING TO MITCHELL TO 
FIND THOSE EXAMPLES WHERE HER 
STORY MIGHT NOT LINE UP. 
WHY DOESN'T SHE KNOW HOW SHE 
GOT 6 OR 8 MILES HOME THAT 
NIGHT? 
THAT MAY BE ENOUGH FOR THEM 
POLITICALLY TO SAY, I STILL 
BELIEVE KAVANAUGH. 
>>  THIS IS WHAT WE'VE LEARNED 
THIS MORNING, IS THAT THIS 
ALLEGATION AGAINST JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAS COME FROM A VERY 
CREDIBLE WOMAN. 
AND IN THE WORDS OF SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN, SHE SAID THIS 
MORNING, THIS IS A JOB 
INTERVIEW FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
AND THE STAKES I THINK ARE EVEN 
HIGHER NOW FOR THE TESTIMONY 
THAT HE GIVES COMING UP AFTER 
THEY FINISH WITH DR. FORD. 
WHAT IS HE GOING TO SAY TO 
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WHETHER HE WAS INVOLVED AND 
WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS VERY 
SERIOUS ASSAULT. 
>>  IT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT 
TEST. 
ALL HE REALLY CAN SAY IS, I 
WASN'T THERE. 
HOW MANY WAYS CAN YOU SAY, I 
WASN'T THERE. 
THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME BEST 
SAID I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING 
LIKE THIS. 
WHEN YOU ARE GRILLED FOR TWO 
HOURS WITH THOSE QUESTIONS, 
IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND A NEW 
WAY TO SAY IT. 
>>  YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT 
IT THERE, JEFF, GAYLE, JAN. 
>>  I THINK THE POINT NANCY WAS 
MAKING IS QUITE RIGHT. 
WE HAVE SEEN DR. FORD GIVE 
DETAILS, BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT 
A WHOLE SET OF MEMORIES. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WHEN HE COMES 
FORWARD, HE CAN'T BE DETAILED 
ABOUT A THING THAT DOESN'T 
HAPPEN. 
AND THEREFORE, HIS TESTIMONY, 
HIS PERIOD BEFORE QUESTIONING 
WILL BE JUST SO VERY MUCH 
DIFFERENT. 
>>  HE'S ALSO SAID, I BELIEVE 
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER. 
I'M SAYING IT WAS NOT ME. 
HE'S BEEN VERY, VERY CLEAR 
ABOUT THAT. 
HE'S NOT DISPUTING SOMETHING 
HAPPENED TO HER. 
HE IS JUST SAYING I WAS NOT THE 
PERSON. 
>>  IF HIS ANSWER IS, THAT 
WASN'T ME, IT GIVES THE 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS TO ASK HIM 
ABOUT A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. 
HOW MUCH DID YOU DRINK IN HIGH 
SCHOOL? 
WHAT KIND OF -- GOING TO ALL 
THESE DETAILS ABOUT HIS 
PERSONAL LIFE THAT I EXPECT 
YOU'LL SEE THIS AFTERNOON. 
>>  DR. FORD HAS NOT BEEN ON 
TRIAL THIS MORNING, BUT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH WILL BE ON TRIAL THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
THEY ARE GOING TO GRILL HIM. 
EXACTLY ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST 
TALKED ABOUT. 
NOT ONLY ABOUT HIS SEXUAL 
HISTORY, WHAT HE HAS SAID IN 
THE PAST ABOUT HIS SEXUAL 
HISTORY. 
HOW MUCH HE DRANK, WHETHER HE 
WAS THE TREASURER OF A GROUP 
THAT WANTED TO DRINK 100 KEGS 
IN THEIR SENIOR YEAR. 
THEY ARE GOING TO TEST HIM. 
>>  AND NORA, YOU HEARD THE 
CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE, 
CHUCK GRASSLEY, VERY EXPRESSLY 
AT THE START OF THIS HEARING 
TRY TO SET SOME GROUND RULES 
AND SAY WE'RE TALKING JUST 
ABOUT THIS ONE CASE. 
THESE DEMOCRAT SENATORS WILL 
WANT TO ASK HIM ABOUT THE OTHER 
ACCUSERS AS WELL. 
JOHN. 
>>  JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE 
HAVE QUITE A FULL DAY OF 
TESTIMONY HERE AND THEN OF 
COURSE ALL OF THE ANALYSIS 
AFTERWARDS. 
>> WE'LL BE HERE ALL AFTERNOON 
AND THEN FOR THE EVENING NEWS 
TONIGHT. 
>> JAN, JEFF, GAYLE KING, 
THANKS SO MUCH, NORAH AND NANCY 
AND FOR ALL OF YOU, THANKS FOR 
WATCHING. 
WATCHING.
>>> NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT 
SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL 
MOMENTS OF THE TESTIMONY SO 
FAR. 
>> BOTH DR. FORD AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAVE BEEN THROUGH A 
TERRIBLE COUPLE WEEKS. 
THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES HAVE 
RECEIVED VIAL THREATS. 
WHAT THEY HAVE ENDURED OUGHT TO 
BE CONSIDERED BY ALL OF US AS 
UNACCEPTABLE AND A POOR 
REFLECTION ON THE STATE OF 
CIVILITY IN OUR DEMOCRACY. 
SO I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU 
BOTH FOR THE WAY YOU'VE BEEN 
TREATED, AND I INTEND HOPEFULLY 
FOR TODAY'S HEARING TO BE SAFE, 
COMFORTABLE AND DIGNIFIED FOR 
BOTH OF OUR WITNESSES. 
I HOPE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN 
ME IN THIS EFFORT OF A SHOW OF 
CIVILITY. 
>> THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF 
PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT THE ME 
TOO MOVEMENT TODAY VERSUS THE 
YEAR OF THE WOMAN ALMOST 27 
YEARS AGO. 
BUT WHILE YOUNG WOMEN ARE 
STANDING UP AND SAYING NO MORE, 
OUR INSTITUTIONS HAVE NOT 
PROGRESSED IN HOW THEY TREAT 
WOMEN WHO COME FORWARD. 
TOO OFTEN WOMEN'S MEMORIES AND 
CREDIBILITY COME UNDER ASSAULT. 
IN ESSENCE, THEY ARE PUT ON 
TRIAL AND FORCED TO DEFEND 
THEMSELVES AND OFTEN 
REVICTIMMIZED IN THE PROCESS. 
>> DO YOU SWEAR THAT THE 
TESTIMONY YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE 
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE 
THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND 
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH SO HELP 
YOU GOD? 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
>> I DON'T HAVE ALL THE 
ANSWERS, AND I DON'T REMEMBER 
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE TO, BUT 
THE DETAILS ABOUT THAT NIGHT 
THAT BRING ME HERE TODAY ARE 
THE ONES I WILL NEVER FORGET. 
THEY HAVE BEEN SEARED INTO MY 
MEMORY AND HAVE HAUNTED ME EPI 
SODICLY AS AN ADULT. 
WHEN I GOT TO THE SMALL 
GATHERING PEOPLE WERE DRINKING 
BEER IN A SMALL LIVING 
ROOM/FAMILY ROOM TYPE AREA ON 
THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. 
I DRANK ONE BEER BRETT AND MARK 
WERE VISIBLY DRUNK. 
EARLY IN THE EVENING I WENT UP 
A VERY NARROW SET OF STAIRS 
LEADING FROM THE LIVING ROOM TO 
A SECOND FLOOR TO USE THE REST 
ROOM. 
WHEN I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE 
STAIRS, I WAS PUSHED FROM 
BEHIND INTO A BEDROOM ACROSS 
FROM THE BATHROOM. 
I COULDN'T SEE WHO PUSHED ME. 
BRETT AND MARK CAME INTO THE 
BEDROOM AND LOCKED THE DOOR 
BEHIND THEM. 
THERE WAS MUSIC PLAYING IN THE 
BEDROOM. 
IT WAS TURNED UP LOUDER BY 
EITHER BRETT OR MARK ONCE WE 
WERE IN THE ROOM. 
I WAS PUSHED ONTO THE BED AND 
BRETT GOT ON TOP OF ME. 
HE BEGAN RUNNING HIS HANDS OVER 
MY BODY AND GRINDING INTO ME. 
I YELLED, HOPING THAT SOMEONE 
DOWNSTAIRS MIGHT HEAR ME, AND I 
TRIED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM, BUT 
HIS WEIGHT WAS HEAVY. 
BRETT GROPED ME AND TRIED TO 
TAKE OFF MY CLOTHES. 
HE HAD A HARD TIME BECAUSE HE 
WAS VERY INEBRIATED AND BECAUSE 
I WAS WEARING A ONE-PIECE 
BATHING SUIT UNDERNEATH MY 
CLOTHING. 
I BELIEVED HE WAS GOING TO RAPE 
ME. 
I TRIED TO YELL FOR HELP. 
WHEN I DID, BRETT PUT HIS HAND 
OVER MY MOUTH TO STOP ME FROM 
YELLING. 
THIS IS WHAT TERRIFIED ME THE 
MOST AND HAS HAD THE MOST 
LASTING IMPACT ON MY LIFE. 
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO BREATHE, 
AND I THOUGHT THAT BRETT WAS 
DISEMLY GOING TO KILL ME. 
-- WAS DISEMLY GOING TO KILL 
ME. 
>> MY NAME IS RACHEL MITCHELL. 
>> NICE TO MEET YOU. 
>> I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE 
FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME FROM 
YOUR STATEMENT THIS MORNING IS 
THAT YOU WERE TERRIFIED, AND I 
JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I'M 
VERY SORRY. 
THAT'S NOT RIGHT. 
>> WELL, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT 
IMPACT THE INVESTMENTS HAD ON 
YOU -- WHAT IMPACT THE EVENTS 
HAD ON YOU? 
>> WELL, I THINK THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT VARIES BY PERSON, AND 
SO FOR ME PERSONALLY ANXIETY, 
PHOBIA AND PTSD-LIKE SYMPTOMS 
AR THE THINGS THAT I'VE BEEN 
COPING WITH. 
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW BRETT 
KAVANAUGH AND MARK JUDGE? 
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU WOULD 
MIX THEM UP WITH SOMEBODY ELSE? 
>> NO, IT IS NOT, AND THE 
PERSON THAT WAS BLAMED FOR THE 
INCIDENT IS ACTUALLY THE PERSON 
WHO INTRODUCED ME TO THEM 
ORIGINALLY, SO HE WAS A MEMBER 
OF COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB, AND I 
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIM 
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S UNFAIR. 
BUT HE IS THE PERSON THAT 
INTRODUCED ME TO THEM. 
>> BUT YOU WOULD NOT MIX UP 
SOMEBODY ELSE WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> OR MARK JUDGE? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> WHAT IS THE STRONGEST MEMORY 
YOU HAVE, STRONGEST MEMORY OF 
THE INCIDENT, SOMETHING THAT 
YOU CANNOT FORGET? 
TAKE WHATEVER TIME YOU NEED. 
>> INDELLIBLE IN THE CAMPUS IS 
THE LAUGHTER, THE UPROARIOUS 
LAUGHTER BETWEEN THE TWO AND 
THEIR HAVING FUN AT MY EXPENSE. 
>> IN JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S OPENING 
TESTIMONY WHICH WE WILL HEAR 
AFTER YOU LEAVE, THIS IS WHAT 
HE SAYS, I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 
OR PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER OF ANY 
KIND WITH DR. FORD. 
I AM NOT QUESTIONING THAT DR. 
FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON IN 
SOME PLACE AT SOME TIME. 
LAST NIGHT THE REPUBLICAN STAFF 
OF THIS COMMITTEE RELEASED TO 
THE MEDIA A TIMELINE THAT SHOWS 
THAT THEY'VE INTERVIEWED TWO 
PEOPLE WHO CLAIM THEY WERE THE 
ONES WHO ACTUALLY ASSAULTED 
YOU. 
I'M ASKING YOU TO ADDRESS THIS 
NEW DEFENSE OF MISTAKEN 
IDENTITY DIRECTLY. 
DR. FORD, WITH WHAT DEGREE OF 
CERTAINTY DO YOU BELIEVE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH ASSAULTED YOU? 
>> 100%. 
>> 100%. 
>> SINCERE AND THOROUGH 
INVESTIGATION IS CRITICAL TO 
THESE CLAIMS IN A PROSECUTOR'S 
WORLD. 
IT MAY BE THE MOST BASIC THING 
THAT WE OWE A VICTIM OR A 
WITNESS COMING FORWARD IS TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE THEM A 
FULL THOROUGH AND SINCERE 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> YOU TALKED ABOUT THE 
OBSTRUCTION FROM THE OTHER 
SIDE. 
I CANNOT LET IT GO BY WHAT 
YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY SO MANY 
TIMES THAT BETWEEN JULY 30th 
AND SEPTEMBER 13th THERE WERE 
45 DAYS THIS COMMITTEE COULD 
HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS 
SITUATION AND HER PRIVACY WOULD 
HAVE BEEN PROTECTED. 
>> DID YOU SHOW A FULL OR 
PARTIAL SET OF THOSE MARRIAGE 
THERAPY RECORDS TO THE 
"WASHINGTON POST"? 
>> I DON'T REMEMBER. 
I REMEMBER SUMMARIZING FOR HER 
WHAT THEY SAID, SO I'M NOT 
QUITE SURE IF I ACTUALLY GAVE 
HER THE RECORD. 
>> OKAY. 
SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE 
REPORTER DID NOT SEE THESE 
NOTES. 
>> I DON'T KNOW IF SHE -- I 
CAN'T RECALL WHETHER SHE SAW 
THEM DIRECTLY OR IF I JUST TOLD 
HER WHAT THEY SAID. 
>> HAVE YOU SHOWN THEM TO 
ANYONE ELSE BESIDES YOUR 
COUNSEL? 
>> JUST THE COUNSEL. 
>> OKAY. 
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S NAME IS NOT 
LISTED IN THOSE NOTE? 
>> HIS NAME IS NOT LISTED IN 
THOSE NOTES. 
>> IS IT ALSO FAIR TO SAY TO 
SAY THE THERAPY'S NOTES THAT 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SAY 
THERE -- THERAPIST'S NOTES THAT 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT SAY 
THERE WERE FOUR BOYS IN THE 
ROOM? 
>> IT DESCRIBES THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, AND IT SAYS 
ERRONEOUSLY BY FOUR BOYS SO THE 
THERAPIST GOT THE CONTENT OF IT 
WRONG. 
>> AND YOU CORRECTED THAT TO 
THE "WASHINGTON POST" REPORTER, 
CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> IN YOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE 
"WASHINGTON POST," YOU SAID 
THAT YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND 
EARLY IN YOUR MARRIAGE YOU HAD 
 PHYSICAL ABUSE. 
IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT 
BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED YOU 
TOLD HIM THAT YOU HAD 
EXPERIENCED, QUOTE, A SEXUAL 
ASSAULT. 
DO THESE TWO THINGS REFER TO 
THE SAME INCIDENT? 
>> YES. 
>> AND AT EITHER POINT ON THESE 
TWO TIMES DID YOU USE ANY 
NAMES? 
>> NO. 
>> IT'S BEEN REPORTED BY THE 
PRESS THAT YOU WOULD NOT SUBMIT 
TO AN INTERVIEW WITH THE 
COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF YOUR FEAR 
OF FLYING, IS THAT TRUE? 
>> WELL, I WAS WILLING -- I WAS 
HOPING THAT THEY WOULD COME TO 
ME, BUT THEN REALIZED THAT WAS 
AN UNREALISTIC REQUEST. 
>> I ALSO SAW ON YOUR C.V. 
THAT YOU LIST THE FOLLOWING 
INTERESTS OF SURF TRAVEL AND 
YOU IN PARENTHESIS PUT HAWAII, 
COSTA RICA, SOUTH PACIFIC 
ISLANDS AND FRENCH POLYNESIA. 
HAVE YOU BEEN ALL TO THOSE 
PLACES? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> BY AIRPLANE? 
>> YES. 
>> NOW, I UNDERSTAND THAT 
YOU'VE TAKEN A POLYGRAPH TEST, 
DR. FORD, THAT FOUND YOU WERE 
BEING TRUTHFUL WHEN YOU 
DESCRIBED WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. 
CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU DECIDED 
TO TAKE THAT TEST? 
>> I WAS MEETING WITH 
ATTORNEYS. 
I WAS INTERVIEWING VARIOUS 
ATTORNEYS, AND THE ATTORNEYS 
ASKED IF I WAS WILLING TO TAKE 
IT, AND I SAID ABSOLUTELY. 
THAT SAID, IT WAS ALMOST AS 
ANXIETY PROVOKING AS AN 
AIRPLANE FLIGHT. 
>> IF WE AGREE ON NOTHING ELSE 
TODAY, I HOPE ON A BIPARTISAN 
BASIS WE CAN AGREE ON HOW MUCH 
COURAGE IT HAS TAKEN FOR YOU TO 
COME FORWARD, AND I THINK YOU 
HAVE EARNED AMERICA'S 
GRATITUDE. 
>> HELLO, EVERYONE, I'M TANYA 
RIVERA IN NEW YORK. 
AS WE AWAIT THE RETURN OF DR. 
BLASEY FORD WHO WILL CONTINUE 
TAKING QUESTIONS ON CAPITOL 
HILL ABOUT HER ACCUSATIONS 
AGAINST SUPREME COURT NOMINEE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WE ARE GOING 
TO WEIGH IN WITH CAITLIN HUEY 
BURNS, A CBSN POLITICAL 
úREPORT 
REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND CBS 
NEWS CARBON FOOTPRINTOR. 
LADIES, -- CARBON FOOTPRINTOR. 
LADIES, THANKS SO MUCH FOR 
BEING WITH US. 
WE'VE ALL BEEN LISTENING 
CAREFULLY TO DR. FORD'S 
TESTIMONY THIS MORNING. 
LET'S START OFF BY TALKING 
ABOUT HOW SHE'S COMING ACROSS. 
CAITLIN, LET ME START WITH YOU. 
IS SHE COMING ACROSS AS 
BELIEVABLE, CREDIBLE AND 
SYMPATHETIC? 
>> SO FAR SHE IS COMING ACROSS 
AS A COMPELLING WITNESS IN THIS 
CASE, AND WHAT'S REALLY 
INTERESTING TO ME ARE A COUPLE 
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. 
FIRST, SHE'S REFERRING TO HER 
OWN BACKGROUND AS A PSYCHOLOGY 
PROFESSOR IN REFERENCING IN 
PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS AND 
SCIENTIFIC TERMS, I SHOULD SAY, 
WHAT IT MEANS TO REMEMBER SOME 
THINGS AND NOT TO REMEMBER 
OTHER THINGS. 
ANOTHER HEADLINE THAT REALLY 
STOOD OUT TO ME WAS HER MEMORY 
OF THE LAUGHTER, TRYING TO MAKE 
CLEAR THAT SHE MAY NOT REMEMBER 
ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
SURROUNDING THAT EVENT, BUT SHE 
REMEMBERS A COUPLE OF THEM 
QUITE CLEARLY, ONE THE ASSAULT 
AND ONE THE LAUGHTER THAT 
ENSUED AFTER, AND I THINK THAT 
LINE IS REALLY GOING TO 
RESONATE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE 
WATCHING THIS. 
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU, 
HONESTLY, HEARING THAT LINE 
JUST MADE MY STOMACH FALL AS 
WELL. 
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT 
IDEA THAT YOU CAN BE ASSAULTED 
AND PEOPLE ARE ENJOYING IT AS 
IT'S HAPPENING THAT I THINK ANY 
WOMAN OR ANY PERSON WOULD 
CRINGE HEARING THAT. 
LESLIE, WOULD YOU AGREE? 
>> IT'S DEFINITELY THE CRUEL 
PART OF ALMOST TWISTING THE 
KNIFE, AND I THINK THAT'S THE 
PART THAT WAS CRINGE WORTHY AND 
EXTREMELY BELIEVABLE. 
AND SHE IS NOT ONLY COMPELLING 
AS A WITNESS, BUT ALSO AS A 
MOM, AS SOMEBODY WHO'S VERY 
APPROACHABLE. 
HER CADENCE, HER WORD CHOICE IS 
VERY -- NOT -- IT'S SOMETHING 
THAT'S VERY ACCESSIBLE. 
SHE'S NOT TRYING TO PUT ON AIR. 
SHE IS VERY MUCH TRYING TO 
ACCOMMODATE THE SENATORS. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S 
UNUSUAL AOUT IT. 
YOU USUALLY SEE THIS KIND OF 
CONSTANT ATTENTION. 
SHE'S HAS NO ATTENTION. 
SHE'S ABOUT COLLABORATIVE TRUTH 
TELLING. 
>> AND SHE'S ALSO NOT COMING 
ACROSS AS TRAINED WHICH IS 
SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 
PERHAPS ACCUSING HER OF, 
SOMEHOW COMING FORWARD AT THE 
BEHEST OF OTHER, RIGHT? 
>> RIGHT. 
THAT SHE WAS SOME SORT OF A 
PAID OR INFLUENCED DEMOCRATIC 
OPERATIVE WHO WAS CONDITIONED 
OR TRAINED BY HER COUNSEL OR 
DEMOCRATIC STAFF, AND THEY'RE 
GOING TO HAVE A VERY HARD TIME 
PROVING THAT THAT WOULD BE THE 
CASE. 
>> AND ESPECIALLY SINCE, YOU 
KNOW, SHE'S TALKED ABOUT THE 
WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS SUCH A 
RELUCTANT WITNESS, THAT SHE HAD 
PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION FIRST 
ANONYMOUSLY AND, SECOND, WHICH 
IS REALLY IMPORTANT BEFORE 
KAVANAUGH WAS EVEN CHOSEN AS 
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
SHE BROUGHT THIS UP TO HER 
CONGRESSWOMAN ANONYMOUSLY WHILE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH WAS LISTED 
AMONG MANY QUALIFIED JUDGES IN 
THIS CASE. 
AND ALSO SHE TALKED ABOUT THE 
WAY IN WHICH SHE WAS TALKING 
WITH HER FRIENDS ON THE BEACH 
ABOUT HOW TO PROCEED WITH THIS, 
WASN'T SURE IF SHE SHOULD HIRE 
A LAWYER. 
SO TO YOUR POINT, YOU KNOW, 
SHE'S TRYING TO PRESENT HERSELF 
AS SOMEONE WHO'S NOT POLITICAL, 
EVEN THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN 
PEOPLE WHO -- AND LAWMAKERS WHO 
ARE SEIZING ON THIS TO ADVANCE 
THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDA. 
>> WHAT'S VERY PARTICULAR AND 
INTERESTING IS HOW AUTHENTIC 
SHE IS ABOUT TAKING YOU BACK TO 
THAT MOMENT IN TIME WHERE SHE 
SAYS SHE WASN'T FULLY DEVELOPED 
AS AN ADULT AND HER BRAIN WAS 
DEVELOPING. 
BUT IF YOU THINK OF YOURSELF AS 
AN UNDERAGED CATHOLIC PRIVATE 
SCHOOL BOY WHO WAS AT A PARTY 
WITH BOYS THAT WAS UNSUPERVISED 
AND YOU'RE DRINKING BEER -- 
>> YOU'RE ALREADY FEELING 
GUILTY ABOUT BEING IN THE ROOM. 
>> HELLO. 
I'M ALREADY GUILTY. 
SO THE IDEA THAT SHE'S GOING TO 
COME FORWARD AND IMMEDIATELY 
TELL HER PAIRMENTS THAT SHE 
MADE A POOR CHOICE TO PUT 
HERSELF IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, 
AND THAT'S PART OF THE SHAME 
CULTURE WE TALK ABOUT. 
>> RIGHT. 
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THIS IS 
THE EARLY '80s WHERE I DON'T 
THINK EVEN THE WORD DATE RAPE 
HAD BEEN COINED YET, RIGHT? 
>> NOT AT ALL. 
THERE WAS NOT A PHONE NUMBER 
YOU COULD CALL THAT WAS SO 
PREVALENT AND AVAILABLE. 
WHO WOULD SHE HAVE CALLED OR 
WHO WOULD SHE HAVE TRUSTED? 
IF YOU GO TO YOUR CLERGY, IT'S 
STILL A FLAWED CHOICE YOU MADE. 
SO FOR HER TO DEAL WITH THAT, 
TO PRESENT IT -- AND THAT'S 
PROBABLY WHY SHE WANTED TO KEEP 
IT VERY PRIVATE AS WELL. 
IN CONSCIENCE, YOU KNOW THAT 
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DOP, BUT 
YOU DON'T NECESSARY -- NEEDS TO 
BE DONE, BUT YOU DON'T 
NECESSARILY WANT TO EXPOSE 
EVERYTHING DU IN THAT 
SITUATION. 
>> LESLIE, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF 
THE GOP'S CHOICE OF HAVING THIS 
PROSECUTOR QUESTIONING DR. 
FORD? 
DO YOU THINK THAT IS WORKING 
OUT FOR THEM, DO YOU THINK IT'S 
MAKING IT LOOK TOO MUCH LIKE 
DR. FORD IS ON TRIAL? 
WHAT'S YOUR PERCEPTION? 
>> THE INTERESTING PART OF THE 
PROSECUTOR WHO IS KNOWN AS 
SOMEBODY WHO SUPPORTS VICTIMS' 
RIGHTS, YOU CAN TELL AFTER THE 
TESTIMONY, SHE WAS MUCH 
STRONGER BEFORE, KIND OF 
CLARIFYING, BUT ONCE DR. FORD 
GAVE THAT TESTIMONY, SHE'S NOW 
KIND OF IN THE WEEDS. 
SHE'S OVER THERE TALKING ABOUT 
INNOCUOUS THINGS AND FLIGHTS 
AND POKE HOLES IN OTHER ASPECTS 
THAT DON'T SEEM GERMANE TO THE 
ACTUAL SNEPT. 
SHE'S NOT -- ACTUAL INCIDENT. 
SHE'S NOT QUESTIONING IN 
GREATER DETAIL THE ACTUAL 
ASSAULT WHICH IS GOING TO BE A 
VERY BIG CONTRAST WHEN 
KAVANAUGH COMES FORWARD. 
>> DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOING 
SOMEWHERE WITH ALL OF THIS? 
IS SHE PIECING SOMETHING 
TOGETHER? 
>> YOU KNOW, THE TWEETS THAT 
SHE'S HIRED -- THAT SHE'S HIRED 
BY THE DEMOCRATS, SHE'S NOT 
HELPING REPUBLICANS. 
I REALLY WONDER AT THIS POINT 
IT IS NOT COMPELLING, IF 
ANYTHING, IT'S EMBOLDING. 
>> I ALSO WANT TO BRING IN CBSN 
POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR AND 
DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST LINDA 
TRAN. 
SHE'S ALSO A FOUNDER PARTNER OF 
270 STRATEGIES. 
SHE JOINS US FROM WASHINGTON. 
LINDA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
BEING WITH US. 
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THIS 
MORNING'S TESTIMONY BY DR. 
FORD? 
>> YOU KNOW, TANYA, MY TAKE IS 
A LITTLE BIT SPLIT. 
SO ON THE ONE HAND I'M 
OBVIOUSLY A DEMOCRATIC 
STRATEGIST AND I'M VIEWING THIS 
THROUGH A POLITICAL LENS AS 
OTHERS ARE, BUT I'M SOMEBODY 
WHO HAS SURVIVED SEXUAL ASSAULT 
MYSELF. 
AND SO THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF 
THIS MORNING ON ME IS I THINK 
MUCH BROADER THAN THE POLITICAL 
VOLLEYING AND THE BACK AND 
FORTH THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A 
LOT TODAY. 
IT IS JUST AMAZING AND 
INSPIRING TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE 
DR. BLASEY FORD COME FORWARD, 
SHARE HER EXPERIENCE IN SO MUCH 
DETAIL, AND TO LIVE THAT TRAUMA 
ALL OVER AGAIN IN FRONT OF ALL 
OF AMERICA, ALL OF THE WORLD 
REALLY WATCHING. 
I THINK THAT HER TESTIMONY WAS 
DEEPLY POWERFUL. 
I THINK THAT -- THE FACT THAT 
SHE'S NOT ONLY SOMEBODY WHO IS 
A VICTIM AND A SURVIVOR, BUT 
ALSO SOMEBODY WHO HAS EXPERT 
TESTIMONY THAT SHE CAN PRESENT 
HERSELF WAS REALLY COMPELLING 
AND VERY, VERY CREDIBLE. 
>> WELL, LINDA, NUMBER ONE, 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING 
FORWARD AS A SURVIVOR. 
I MEAN, THE MORE PEOPLE THAT 
COME FORWARD, THE MORE POWERFUL 
THE CHORUS IS. 
AND AS SOMEBODY WHO IS A 
SURVIVOR OF SOME SORT OF SEXUAL 
VIOLENCE, DID YOU PERCEIVE HER 
TESTIMONY AS BEING HONEST? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE 
STARTED TO TALK ABOUT HOW THERE 
WERE CERTAIN DETAILS THAT 
REALLY WERE SEARED INTO HER 
MEMORY AND THAT HAD COME BACK 
TO HAUNT HER PERIODICALLY AND 
AGAIN AND AGAIN THROUGHOUT HER 
LIFE, THAT IS SOMETHIG THAT I 
THINK ANYBODY WHO'S LIVED 
THROUGH ASSAULT CAN RELATE TO. 
THERE ARE, YOU KNOW, A CERTAIN 
TOUCH, A CERTAIN SOUND THAT YOU 
HEARD, AN IMAGE THAT YOU KEPT 
HAVING NIGHTMARES ABOUT, THAT 
WILL NEVER, EVER LEAVE YOU NO 
MATTER HOW MUCH THERAPY YOU 
HAVE, NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES 
YOU MAY HAVE DISCUSSED IT OR 
TRIED TO GRAPPLE WITH IT OVER 
THE YEARS SINCE IT'S HAPPENED. 
AND ALSO THE IDEA THAT THERE 
ARE CERTAIN OTHER THINGS THAT 
MAYBE WERE NOT AS PROMINENT IN 
HER MEMORY, I MEAN, THE TRUTH 
IS THAT IF YOU LIVE THROUGH AN 
INCIDENT LIKE THIS, IF YOU LIVE 
THROUGH AN ATTACK, THE ONLY 
THING YOU WISH YOU COULD DO IS 
FORGET ALL OF IT. 
YOU WISH YOU COULD GO BACK AND 
MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY. 
AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU 
JUST CAN'T GET AWAY FROM. 
SO I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS 
EXTREMELY HONEST, PAINFUL AND 
VERY TRAUMATIC FOR SOMEBODY 
ELSE WHO HAS LIVED THROUGH IT 
TO WATCH AS WELL. 
>> AND SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS 
AT RISK HERE THEN FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS? 
CLEARLY THERE WILL BE A LOT OF 
WOMEN OUT THERE WATCHING DR. 
FORD'S TESTIMONY, REACTING TO 
IT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT 
YOU HAVE, AND I THINK THAT WE 
HAVE HERE. 
WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE? 
>> I THINK THERE'S A LOT AT 
STAKE FOR REPUBLICANS BROADLY. 
ONE OF THE MORE RECENT POLLS 
THAT I'VE SEEN, I THINK MORNING 
CONSULT DID IT SHOWED THAT IN 
THE LAST FEW DAYS ALONE SUPPORT 
FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SUPPORT 
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH HAVE 
DROPPED PRECIPITOUSLY AND 
THAT'S BEEN A STEADY TREND. 
YOU HAVE TO IMAGINE THAT SEEING 
THE TESTIMONY FROM DR. BLASEY 
FORD TODAY, HEARING MUCH MORE 
DETAIL ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 
ONLY GOING TO MAKE THE 
SITUATION WORSE. 
IN THE MEANTIME, YOU HAVE 
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE RUNNING IN 
EVEN RED STATES WHO OUGHT TO BE 
LOOKING OVER THEIR BACKS 
BECAUSE THEY'VE STOOD REALLY, 
REALLY STRONGLY BY KAVANAUGH, 
BY THIS NOMINATION AND HAVE 
FRANKLY TRIED TO SHAME AND 
IMPUGN DR. BLASEY FORD AS PART 
OF THAT ARGUMENT. 
AND THAT IS A VERY, VERY 
DANGEROUS THING FOR THEM AS 
THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING 
TO HAPPEN IN THE WEEKS TO COME. 
>> AND WE UNDERSTAND THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WATCHING THE 
HEARINGS. 
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GET TO THIS 
ISSUE OF CREDIBILITY BECAUSE I 
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY THE 
CRUX OF THE MATTER HERE. 
WHO DO YOU BELIEVE, DR. FORD OR 
BRETT KAVANAUGH? 
AND I THINK THAT SO FAR DR. 
FORD IS COMING ACROSS AS 
IMMINENTLY CREDIBLE. 
I THINK THAT SO FAR JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS COMING ACROSS AS 
SLIGHTLY LESS SO WHEN HE TALKS 
ABOUT HIS PAST AS A TEENAGER 
AND AS A STUDENT AT YALE. 
WHAT DO WE NEED TO HEAR FROM 
HIM THAT WILL MAKE US BELIEVE 
IN HIM ONCE AGAIN IN TERMS OF 
HIS BEHAVIOR IN THE PAST? 
I MEAN, AT THIS POINT I DON'T 
THINK ANYONE BELIEVES HE WAS 
QUITE THE CHOIR BOY THAT HE 
WOULD LIKE EVERYONE TO BELIEVE. 
LYNDA. 
>> WELL, I MEAN, I THINK THAT'S 
EXACTLY RIGHT, TANYA. 
HE'S IN A TOUGH SPOT, HONESTLY, 
HE REALLY IS BECAUSE HIS 
DEFENSE HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN TO 
CATEGORICALLY DENY THAT 
ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ACCUSED 
OF HIM HAS EVER HAPPENED. 
WE'VE JUST SPENT SEVERAL HOURS 
HEARING IN EXCRUCIATINGLY 
PAINFUL DETAIL THE ALLEGATIONS 
THAT DR. BLASEY FORD HAS LEVIED 
AGAINST HIM AND SHE'S COME 
ACROSS EXTRAORDINARILY 
CREDIBLE. 
AND FOR HIM TO SIT THERE AND 
SAY NONE OF THIS HAPPENED, 
SHE'S ABSOLUTELY LYING IS NOT 
GOING TO COME ACROSS VERY WELL. 
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE MANY 
DETAILS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM 
OTHER ACCUSATIONS WHICH MAY OR 
MAY NOT BE TRUE, WE HAVE TO PUT 
THAT OUT THERE, BUT OTHER 
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN 
LEVIED AGAINST HIM, THE 
NARRATIVE THAT WE'VE HEARD AND 
ANECDOTES FROM STORIES THAT HIS 
FRIEND MARK JUDGE HAVE WRITTEN, 
THEY ALL KIND OF POINT TO THIS 
IMAGE OF A PARTY BOY WHICH RUNS 
REALLY COUNTER TO EVERYTHING HE 
SAID. 
HE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO COME 
ACROSS AS SOMEBODY WHO IS 
SPEAKING THE TRUTH AND CREDIBLE 
AND HE'S DOING IT. 
>> SO LESLIE AND INDICATE LIN, 
I'D -- CAITLIN, I'D LIKE YOU TO 
WEIGH IN AS WELL. 
HOW MUCH CAN HE BACKTRACK TO 
SEEM CREDIBLE? 
HE SAID HE NEVER BLACKED OUT 
FROM DRINKING. 
WE HAVE NOW, YOU KNOW, COLLEGE 
CLASSMATES WHO HAVE COME OUT 
AND SAID, WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF 
HE BLACKED OUT, BUT HE DRANK A 
LOT, PEOPLE WHO SEEMED TO PAINT 
A DIFFERENT PORTRAIT OF HIM AT 
LEAST WHEN HE WAS PARTYING, 
RIGHT, NOT NECESSARILY THE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT SHOWED UP 
TO CLASS AND GOT STRAIGHT A'S, 
BUT THE BRETT KAVANAUGH THAT 
PERHAPS WHEN HE WAS OUT WITH 
HIS FRIENDS WAS A SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT BRETT KAVANAUGH THAN 
WE'VE HEARD HIM DESCRIBE. 
SO AT THIS POINT WHAT DO WE 
NEED HIM TO SAY THAT WILL MAKE 
US BELIEVE HIM, LESLIE? 
>> IT'S GOING TO BE VERY 
DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO GO BACK 
AND CHANGE HISTORY AND CHANGE 
HIS STORY. 
SO WHAT THE STORY, THE 
NARRATIVE THAT COMES OUT IS 
THAT HE WAS A BAD DRUNK. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> THAT HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO WAS 
CRUDE, HE PERHAPS, YOU KNOW, 
ENGAGED IN THIS KIND OF 
ACTIVITY, BUT THERE IS SOME 
ACTIVITY TO POINT TO. 
AND THEN THERE'S THE OTHER SIDE 
WHEN HE WAS, YOU KNOW, WORKING 
AS A COLLEAGUE AND HE HAS OTHER 
CHARACTER REFERENCES TO GO BACK 
TO WHEN HE WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL 
AND HIGH SCHOOL. 
THOSE ARE GREAT. 
BUT IT'S THIS ISSUE OF ALCOHOL 
AND WHAT HIS BEHAVIOR WAS LIKE 
AT THAT TIME WHICH 
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK WE'RE 
GOING TO DIVE DEEPER INTO LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON. 
THAT'S REALLY THE QUESTION. 
BECAUSE IF HE HAD SAID I HAD 
DONE SOME THINGS I'M NOT PROUD 
OF, ALCOHOL WAS INVOLVED IN 
THOSE THINGS, BUT I'VE NEVER 
DONE ANYTHING TO THE EXTENT OF 
THAT -- 
>> EXACTLY. 
>> THERE WOULD BE -- PEOPLE 
WOULD GIVE HIM THE BENEFIT OF 
THE DOUBT. 
HE'S REPENALTIED. 
AND THERE ARE MANY -- REPENTED. 
AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE DONE THINGS AS YOUNG 
TEENAGERS OR YOUNG ADULTS AND 
CHANGED THEIR BEHAVIOR. 
>> YES. 
>> AND REALLY BECOME KIND OF 
LEADERS IN OUR COUNTRY. 
>> AND I THINK AMERICANS ARE 
SYMPATHETIC TOWARDS PEOPLE WHO 
ARE REPENTANT AND CHANGE THEIR 
CHARACTER. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION WHY 
KAVANAUGH SET A HIGH BAR FOR 
HIMSELF TO MEET FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING, FIRST OF ALL BY 
DENYING HE WAS EVEN AT THIS 
PARTY AND THEN GOING EVEN 
FURTHER IN THAT FOX NEWS 
INTERVIEW TO KIND OF PAINT 
HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WASN'T 
PARTICIPATING. 
>> I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP 
THAT FOX NEWS INTERVIEW. 
WE HAVE SOME SOUND FOR THAT. 
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY IT RIGHT 
NOW. 
>> WERE THERE TIMES WHEN 
PERHAPS YOU DRANK SO MUCH -- 
WAS THERE EVER A TIME THAT YOU 
DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU COULDN'T 
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE 
NIGHT BEFORE? 
>> NO. 
THAT NEVER HAPPENED. 
>> YOU NEVER SAID TO ANYONE, I 
DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT 
LAST NIGHT? 3
>> NO, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. 
>> NOW OF COURSE HE WAS NOT 
UNDER OATH THERE, THAT WAS A 
MEDIA INTERVIEW, SO IT'S 
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT HE WILL 
FACE ON CAPITOL HILL. 
BUT DO WE ALL BELIEVE THAT AT 
THIS POINT? 
>> WELL, WHAT HE IS ALSO GOING 
TO SAY IN HIS TESTIMONY TODAY 
ACCORDING TO THE PREPARED 
REMARKS THAT WERE RELEASED BY 
THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
YESTERDAY, HE'S GOING TO SAY 
THAT, YEAH, I DRANK SOME BEERS 
O THE WEEKENDS, I'M 
PARAPHRASING HERE, BUT, YOU 
KNOW, AND I'VE DONE SOME -- 
THERE HAVE BEEN THINGS THAT I 
HAVE DONE THAT I CRINGE ABOUT, 
BUT I DID NOT DO THIS, AND HE 
ALSO GOES ON TO SAY IN THAT 
PREPARED TESTIMONY THAT WHILE 
FORD MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED THE 
TRAUMATIC EVENT OF A SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, IT WASN'T BY HIM. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> SO HE'S KIND OF TRYING TO 
THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE BY 
SAYING I'M NOT BEING 
UNSYMPATHETIC TO HER AND WHAT 
SHE WENT THROUGH, I'M JUST 
SAYING THAT WASN'T ME. 
>> YES. 
BUT THERE ARE AT LEAST A FEW 
SENATORS WHO HAVE SAID WHETHER 
OR NOT BRETT KAVANAUGH 
COMMITTED THIS SEXUAL ASSAULT I 
DON'T KNOW, BUT WHETHER HE'S 
BEING TOTALLY TRUTHFUL WITH US 
IS REALLY WHAT I AM WORRIED 
ABOUT. 
>> AND THAT IS A SITUATION HE 
CREATED FOR HIMSELF BY SETTING 
WHAT CAITLIN IS TALKING ABOUT 
THE BAR SO HIGH THAT IT'S JUST 
NOT BELIEVABLE, ESPECIALLY -- 
THAT'S BEFORE WE KNEW HOW 
CREDIBLE DR. FORD WAS GOING TO 
BE AND HOW SYMPATHETIC A 
CHARACTER BECAUSE SHE'S 
CERTAINLY SOMEBODY YOU CAN SEE 
DOES NOT HAVE A POLITICAL 
MOTIVE TO DO IT, AND HE HAS 
EVERY POLITICAL MOTIVE TO REACT 
THE WAY HE DOES. 
>> SO HOW CAN HE FIX THIS DO 
YOU THINK IN HIS TESTIMONY? 
HE'S SORT OF BOXED HIMSELF IN 
IN A CERTAIN MANNER AT THIS 
POINT. 
WHAT DO WE NEED TO SEE? 
WHAT DOES HE NEED TO SAY THAT 
WILL CLEAR THIS UP? 
>> WELL, THE PEOPLE THAT HE 
NEEDS TO CONVINCE AREN'T 
NECESSARILY ON THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE. 
THEY ARE MEMBERS LIKE SUSAN 
COLLINS OF MAINE, LISA 
MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA, JEFF FLAKE 
OF COURSE IS ON THAT COMMITTEE, 
AND INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, HE 
DID CEDE HIS QUESTION TO THE 
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR IN THAT 
INSTANCE. 
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A COUPLE OF 
SWING VOTES HERE IN TERMS OF 
WHAT HE COULD GET IN THE 
SENATE. 
AND WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER 
TOO THAT WHILE THE PUBLIC IS 
WATCHING, ONE KEY FIGURE OF 
THAT PUBLIC IS WATCHING WHICH 
IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES WHO HAS THE POWER TO, 
YOU KNOW, DEMAND THAT KAVANAUGH 
GET A VOTE OR TO WITHDRAW HIM 
DEPENDING ON HOW HE FEELS THIS 
TESTIMONY HAS BEEN GOING, HOW 
HE FEELS ABOUT FORD, HOW HE 
FEELS ABOUT KAVANAUGH IN 
RESPONDING TO FORD. 
IT STILL REMAINS A BIG QUESTION 
MARK. 
OF COURSE HOVERING OVER THAT 
DECISION TOO IS HE HAS ALSO 
BEEN ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AND HE ELABORATED ON THAT 
YESTERDAY IN THE PRESS 
CONFERENCE SAYING THAT IS 
INFORMING HIS -- IS FORMING HIS 
OPINION IN TERMS OF KAVANAUGH. 
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT. 
WE DO HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT 
QUESTION, YOU KNOW, OF 
CERTAINTY, AND DR. FORD SAID 
SHE IS 100% CERTAIN, NOT 99.9%, 
BUT 100% CERTAIN THAT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS THE MAN WHO 
ASSAULTED HER OR THE BOY, 
RATHER. 
DO WE NEED TO HEAR BRETT 
KAVANAUGH SAY HE IS 100% 
CERTAIN HE DID NOT DO IT? 
>> LET'S JUST SAY HE DOES THAT. 
LET'S SAY HE DOES THAT. 
SHE STILL IS COMING ACROSS AS 
SUCH -- IN SUCH A COMPELLING 
WAY BECAUSE SHE'S EXPLAINING 
HER TRAUMA. 
SHE'S EXPLAINING THE LAUGHTER, 
SHE'S EXPLAINING THESE VERY 
SPECIFIC DETAILS THAT AS SHE 
SAID SEARED HER MEMORY, AND I 
DON'T THINK -- THE INTERESTING 
PART, AND LYNDA TALKS ABOUT IT 
A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF HOW 
WE'RE LOSING REPUBLICAN WOMEN 
AND INDEPENDENT WOMEN. 
WE GOT A LOT OF WOMEN WHO 
EXPERIENCED SOMETHING VERY 
SIMILAR TO THAT AND IT ECHOS 
THAT ONE OR TWO MEMORY POINTS. 
SO SHE IS SPEAKING AT A 
DIFFERENT FREQUENCY THAT IS 
GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR 
HIM TO COUNTER. 
>> LET'S TOSS FOR A MOMENT 
DURING THE TESTIMONY WHEN DR. 
FORD TALKED ABOUT HER STRONGEST 
MEMORY OF THE ASSAULT. 
LET'S LISTEN. 
>> WHAT IS THE STRONGEST MEMORY 
YOU HAVE, STRONGEST MEMORY OF 
THE INCIDENT, SOMETHING THAT 
YOU CANNOT FORGET? 
TAKE WHATEVER TIME YOU NEED. 
>> INDELLIBLE IN THE HIPPA 
CAMPUS IS THE LAUGHTER, THE 
UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER BETWEEN THE 
TWO AND THEIR HAVING FUN AT MY 
EXPENSE. 
>> YOU'VE NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT 
LAUGHTER, YOU'VE NEVER 
FORGOTTEN THEM LAUGHING AT YOU? 
>> THEY WERE LAUGHING WITH EACH 
OTHER. 
>> AND YOU WERE THE OBJECT OF 
THE LAUGHTER? 
>> I WAS UNDERNEATH ONE OF THEM 
WHILE THE TWO LAUGHED, TWO 
FRIENDS HAVING A REALLY GOOD 
TIME WITH ONE ANOTHER. 
>> I MEAN, THOSE WORDS ARE LIKE 
A GUT PUNCH, AND SHE'S 
DELIVERING THEM WITH -- THERE'S 
SO MUCH PAIN PRESENT. 
YOU KNOW, TO ME IT GOES TO THE 
QUESTION OF CHARACTER, RIGHT? 
HOW CAN ANYONE DERIVE PLEASURE 
AT TERRIFYING A YOUNG, INNOCENT 
GIRL, RIGHT? 
EVEN IF YOU ARE A YOUNG MAN 
WHO'S MAYBE HAD A FEW TOO MANY 
BEERS, YOU WOULD STILL THINK 
THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT YOUR 
CHARACTER WOULD KICK IN. 
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE THE 
INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE 
IT'S LIKE TWO SIDES OF THE SAME 
MAN, RIGHT? 
WE HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE LONG 
HISTORY OF A VERY STRONG SOLID 
JURIST, AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS 
OTHER SIDE, THIS KIND OF DARKER 
SIDE WHEN ALCOHOL SEEMS TO BE 
INVOLVED IN THE YOUTH BEING 
INVOLVED. 
MAYBE HE SHOOK ALL OF THAT, 
MAYBE HE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT. 
BUT HE DOESN'T EVER ADMIT IT. 
HE DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT IN A 
WAY THAT SEEMS PALATABLE THAT 
PEOPLE CAN ACCEPT. 
AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE 
HARDEST PART. 
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT HE'S 
GOING TO HAVE THAT KIND OF 
COMING TO TRUTHFULNESS WITH THE 
COMMITTEE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE 
IT WOULD REQUIRE HIM TO GO BACK 
AGAINST SOME OF HIS PREVIOUS 
STATEMENTS. 
>> RIGHT. 
BUT THAT'S THE TYPE OF HUMILITY 
WE WOULD ALMOST LIKE TO SEE 
FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS COMMITTED 
SOMETHING EGREGIOUS IN THEIR 
PAST. 
I READ A VERY INTERESTING 
ACCOUNT OF A WOMAN WHO DID HAVE 
A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE IN HIGH 
SCHOOL AND LATER HER ASSAILANT 
FOUND HER AND TEARFULLY 
APOLOGIZED, AND SHE SAID YOU 
KNOW WHAT? 
I FORGAVE HIM. 
BUT HE APOLOGIZED. 
AND I THINK WITH WHAT IS SO 
SEARING FOR SO MANY WOMEN WHO 
HAVE GONE THROUGH SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS IS THE SEEMING LACK 
OF SELF-QUESTIONING AS TO WHY 
WOULD THESE WOMEN EVEN EVER 
ACCUSE ME OF THIS, YOU KNOW, 
THERE'S NO QUESTIONING. 
YES, MAYBE HE SAYS I DID NOT DO 
THIS, BUT WOULD HE STOP AND SAY 
WHY ARE THEY ACCUSING ME OF 
THIS? 
LET ME THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A 
MOMENT AND HAVE SOME SORT OF 
SELF-RECKONING OF SOME TYPE OF 
BEHAVIOR IN HIS PAST THAT MIGHT 
HAVE LENT THIS -- SOMETHING 
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. 
>> WELL, HE -- I THINK YOU 
BRING UP A REALLY GOOD POINT IN 
TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES THAT HE 
WILL HAVE IN ADDRESSING THAT 
KIND OF QUESTION IF IT COMES UP 
BECAUSE HE SAYS FROM THE VERY 
BEGINNING THAT HE HAD NO 
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS, THAT HE 
WASN'T THERE AND THAT IT WASN'T 
HIM. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> SO, AGAIN, GOING TO THAT BAR 
THAT HE -- SO GOING TO THAT BAR 
THAT'S SET, IT'S DIFFICULT FOR 
HIM TO DEVIATE IN ANY WAY BY 
THAT. 
AND HE'S GOING TO DO IT BY 
PROXY, RIGHT? 
SAY I DIDN'T DO THIS BUT -- I 
THINK TALKING ABOUT THE 
LAUGHTER ELEMENT AND WHAT SHE 
WENT THROUGH, REMEMBER, SHE WAS 
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL. 
THAT IS A VERY FORMITIVE AGE, A 
COMING OF AGE AND A VERY 
SENSITIVE TIME, ESPECIALLY FOR 
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 
THAT THIS WAS 35 YEARS AGO. 
WE ALSO HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT 
SHE SAYS HAVE BEEN LASTING 
EFFECTS FROM THAT. 
SHE'S TALKED ABOUT PTSD, SHE'S 
TALKED ABOUT CURRENT ANXIETY, 
PANIC ATTACKS, CLAUSE INTRODUCE 
PHOBIA, THINGS THAT HAVE -- 
CLOS INTRODUCE PHOBIA, THINGS 
THAT. 
IT'S NOT THINGS THAT HAPPENED 
35 YEARS AGO, IT'S REMARKABLE 
THAT IN OVER 35 YEARS SHE IS 
STILL FEELING THE EFFECTS. 
>> WELL, THE MANIFEST 
ALLEGATIONS, RIGHT, WHETHER 
THEY'RE PANIC ATTACKS ON AN 
AIRPLANE AND PEOPLE ARE 
CRITICIZING ON TWITTER, WELL, 
SHE GOT ON A PLANE TO GO ON 
VACATION. 
IT DOES NOT MEAN SHE CANNOT GET 
ON A PLANE. 
IT MEANS THAT ANXIETY CONTINUE, 
IT'S THE ANXIETY TO PUT IN A 
SECOND FRONT DOOR, IT'S THE 
ANXIETY TO HAVE DIFFICULTY IN 
RELATIONSHIPS. 
AND SO I THINK COLLECTIVELY WE 
WILL AGREE SOMETHING DID 
HAPPEN. 
BUT HOW CLEAR SHE IS ABOUT WHO 
ASSAULTED HER IS GOING TO BE 
THE BIGGER CHALLENGE, RIGHT? 
AND HOW ARE WE GOING TO 
RECONCILE THOSE TWO? 
AND EVEN IF THE JUDGE DOES COME 
ACROSS AS VERY SYMPATHETIC, 
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO REALLY 
WONDER ABOUT THIS, AND I THINK 
THAT'S THE CHALLENGE. 
AND I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO GO 
THROUGH SOME REALLY UGLY 
DETAILS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS 
THAT NOBODY -- NOBODY WANTS TO 
GO THROUGH. 
>> I AGREE. 
LET'S LISTEN TO DR. FORD TALK 
ABOUT HOW THIS EVENT HAS 
AFFECTED HER LIFE. 
>> BRETT'S ASSAULT ON ME 
DRASTICALLY ALTERED MY LIFE FOR 
A VERY LONG TIME. 
I WAS TOO AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO 
TELL ANYONE THESE DETAILS. 
I DID NOT WANT TO TELL MY 
PARENTS THAT I AT AGE 15 WAS IN 
A HOUSE WITHOUT ANY PARENTS 
PRESENT DRINKING BEER WITH 
BOYS. 
I CONVINCED MYSELF THAT BECAUSE 
BRETT DID NOT RAPE ME, I SHOULD 
JUST MOVE ON AND JUST PRETEND 
THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
OVER THE YEARS I TOLD VERY, 
VERY FEW FRIENDS THAT I HAD 
THIS TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE 
>> LYNDA, I WANT TO BRING YOU 
IN NOW BECAUSE WE JUST HEARD 
DR. FORD TALK ABOUT THIS 
EXPERIENCE THAT HAPPENED WHEN 
SHE WAS 15 WENT ON TO AFFECT 
THE REST OF HER LIFE. 
DR. FORD AND OTHERS WHO COME 
FORWARD WITH STORIES OR 
ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
THAT HAPPENED LONG AGO OFTEN 
FACE CRITICISM, SOME PEOPLE 
SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT 
HAPPENED A LONG TIME AGO, WHY 
RUIN A MAN'S LIFE NOW? 
AND I THINK WHEN YOU HEAR HOW 
HER LIFE HAS ALREADY -- I MEAN, 
NOT BEEN RUINED, SHE'S 
OBVIOUSLY A VERY SUCCESSFUL 
WOMAN, BUT SHE'S CARRIED SO 
MUCH OF THE PAIN FROM THAT 
ATTACK THROUGH THE REST OF HER 
LIFE, IT COLORS THOSE 
ACCUSATIONS THAT COME FROM 
PEOPLE SAYING, WELL, WHY ARE 
YOU TRYING TO RUIN SOMEONE'S 
LIFE AT THIS POINT, WOULD YOU 
AGREE, LYNDA? 
>> YEAH. 
I THINK THAT DR. BLASEY FORD 
GETS AT THE CORE OF WHAT SO 
MANY VICTIMS OF ASSAULT DEAL 
WITH WHICH IS SHE SAID SHE WAS 
AFRAID AND ASHAMED. 
BECAUSE WHEN SOMETHING LIKE 
THIS HAPPENS TO YOU, YOU FEEL 
SOME SENSE OF GUILT, YOU WONDER 
WHAT ROLE YOU MAY HAVE PLAYED 
IN BRINGING IT ABOUT AND FEEL 
LIKE YOU'RE NOT SOMEHOW 
INNOCENT OF IT, NO MATTER WHAT 
THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. 
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S PART OF 
WHAT SHE WAS DESCRIBING. 
I ALSO THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR 
IN HER DETAILING OF THE 
CHRONOLOGY OF HOW SHE BROUGHT 
HER STORY FORWARD THAT SHE WAS 
GRAPPLING WITH WHETHER OR NOT 
IT MADE SENSE AT THIS JUNCTURE 
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS TO SHARE 
THIS STORY WITH ANYONE, MUCH 
LESS WITH THE WORLD. 
SO I THINK THAT SHE IS STILL 
CLEARLY DEALING WITH THE IMPACT 
OF THAT REGARDLESS OF HOW 
SUCCESSFUL SHE'S BEEN IN HER 
LIFE AND THAT THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT A LOT OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO 
HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED CAN REALLY 
RELATE TO. 
ALSO TO THE EARLIER POINT ABOUT 
WHAT, YOU KNOW, BRETT KAVANAUGH 
CAN SAY OR DO AT THIS POINT, 
WHEN YOU JUXTAPOSE ANYTHING 
THAT HE MIGHT SAY IN THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF HOURS WITH DR. BLASEY 
FORD TALKING ABOUT THE 
INDELLIBLE MEMORY OF HIS 
LAUGHTER, I THINK THERE'S VERY 
LITTLE THAT HE CAN DO THAT IS 
GOING TO SWAY PUBLIC OPINION IN 
A WAY THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. 
BUT THE REAL QUESTION COMES 
DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT HE CAN 
REACH THE HANDFUL OF 
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROBABLY 
STILL SWAYABLE AT THIS POINT 
WHO ARE GOING TO ULTIMATELY 
VOTE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO MOVE 
FORWARD WITH THIS CONFIRMATION. 
>> RIGHT. 
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT QUESTION 
OF MEMORY FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE 
DR. FORD DISCUSSED IT, AND SHE 
SAID, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ARE 
THE VICTIM OF AN ASSAULT LIKE 
THAT, AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
EARLIER, THERE ARE CERTAIN 
THINGS THAT JUST REMAIN IN YOUR 
MIND CRYSTAL CLEAR. 
NOW, IF YOU TALK ABOUT THE 
MEMORY OF THE ATTACKER, IF THIS 
WAS NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL TO THE 
ATTACKER, THEN PERHAPS THERE 
ARE NO ELEMENTS OF IT THAT 
REMAIN IN HIS MEMORY IN SUCH A 
CLEAR MANNER. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THIS DID NO THE 
HAVE SUCH A GRAND -- THIS DID 
NOT HAVE SUCH A GRAND AFFECT ON 
-- OH, WE WILL PICK THIS UP 
LATER BECAUSE DR. FORD JUST SAT 
BACK DOWN. 
SHE'S NOT GOING TO START 
SPEAKING RIGHT AWAY, BUT JUST 
REQUESTING, DO YOU THINK IT IS 
THEN POSSIBLE THAT THE 
ATTACKER, IF THE EVENT DOES NOT 
HAVE THE SAME LIFETIME EFFECT 
ON THEM DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME 
MEMORY OF IT? 
>> RIGHT. 
THIS IS GOING TO BE -- AGAIN, 
GOING BACK TO THE VERY 
BEGINNING IN WHICH KAVANAUGH 
SAYS THAT HE WASN'T AT THIS 
PARTY. 
>> RIGHT. 
>> AND THAT HE DIDN'T DO THIS. 
AGAIN, IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THEN 
TO DEEFATE FROM THAT IF THAT -- 
DEVIATE FROM THAT IF THAT IS 
YOUR OVERARCHING ARGUMENT THE 
WHOLE THING. 
>> IT COULD BE HIS ARGUMENT 
THAT HE DIDN'T DO IT, RIGHT? 
>> MAYBE. 
BUT YOU ALSO LOOK AT THE 
COMPANY HE KEPT AND HE KEPT 
COMPANY WITH SOMEBODY WITH VERY 
LEWD BEHAVIOR, KIND OF 
CHARACTERIZING THAT MOMENT IN 
TIME. 
SO IT'S VERY HARD BY 
ASSOCIATION TO SAY YOU WERE 
NEVER AROUND THAT KIND OF 
ENVIRONMENT WHEN YOU WERE. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
I THINK THAT IS THE PART OF HIS 
PAST THAT WE STILL NEED TO HEAR 
HIM SPEAK HONESTLY AND OPENLY 
ABOUT. 
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE ABOUT TO 
BEGIN, SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE 
HEARING WITH DR. BLASEY FORD. 
>> I'M READY. 
>> SENATOR HIRONO. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, IS IT YOUR INTENT 
TO CEDE ALL REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS' TIME TO YOUR 
PROSECUTOR RATHER THAN THEY 
THEMSELVES CEDING THEIR TIME TO 
HER? 
>> WE ALL KNOW THE PROSECUTOR, 
EVEN THOUGH THIS CLEARLY IS NOT 
A CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IS ASKING 
DR. FORD ALL KINDS OF QUESTIONS 
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE AND 
AFTER, BUT BASICALLY NOT DURING 
THE ATTACK. 
THE PROSECUTOR SHOULD KNOW THAT 
SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS OFTEN 
DO NOT REMEMBER PERIPHERAL 
INFORMATION SUCH AS WHAT 
HAPPENED BEFORE OR AFTER THE 
TRAUMATIC EVENT, AND YET SHE 
WILL PERSIST IN ASKING THESE 
QUESTIONS ALL TO UNDERMINE THE 
MEMORY AND BASICALLY THE 
CREDIBILITY OF DR. FORD. 
BUT WE ALL KNOW DR. FORD'S 
MEMORY OF THE ASSAULT IS VERY 
CLEAR. 
DR. FORD, THE REPUBLICAN'S 
PROSECUTOR HAS ASKED YOU ALL 
KINDS OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO 
YOU CALLED AND WHEN, ASKING 
DETAILS THAT WOULD BE ASKED IN 
A CROSS EXAMINATION OF A 
WITNESS IN A CRIMINAL TRIAL, 
BUT THIS IS NOT A CRIMINAL 
PROCEEDING. 
THIS IS A CONFIRMATION 
PROCEEDING. 
I THINK I KNOW WHAT SHE'S 
TRYING TO GET AT. 
SO I'LL JUST ASK YOU VERY 
PLAINLY, DR. FORD, IS THERE A 
POLITICAL MOTIVATION FOR YOUR 
COMING FORWARD WITH YOUR 
ACCOUNT OF THE ASSAULT BY BRETT 
KAVANAUGH? 
>> NO. 
AND I'D LIKE TO REITERATE AGAIN 
THAT I WAS TRYING TO GET THE 
INFORMATION TO YOU WHILE THERE 
WAS STILL A LIST OF OTHER WHAT 
LOOKED LIKE EQUALLY QUALIFIED 
CANDIDATES. 
>> AND YET THEY'RE NOT HERE TO 
TESTIFY. 
DR. FORD, I'D LIKE TO JOIN ME 
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE THANKED YOU 
FOR COMING FORWARD TODAY AND I 
AND WE ALL ADMIRE YOU FOR WHAT 
YOU ARE DOING, AND I UNDERSTAND 
WHY YOU HAVE COME FORWARD. 
YOU WANTED US AND THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNEW 
ABOUT THE CHARACTER, THE 
CHARACTER OF THE MAN WE ARE 
CONSIDERING FOR A LIFETIME 
APPOINTMENT TO THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
>> I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT ALSO 
TO NOTE THE SIGNIFICANT 
PERSONAL SACRIFICE YOU'VE COME 
FORWARD TO SHARE YOUR TRAUMATIC 
EXPERIENCE WITH US AND THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
YOU'VE HAD TO MOVE, YOU'VE HAD 
DEATH THREATS, ALL IN A MANNER 
OF -- BASICALLY 
REVICTIMMIZATION EXPERIENCES 
HAVE COME YOUR WAY, BUT BY 
COMING FORWARD YOU HAVE 
INSERTED THE QUESTION OF 
CHARACTER INTO THIS NOMINATION 
AND HOPEFULLY BACK INTO 
AMERICAN LIFE AND RIGHTLY SO. 
WE SHOULD BE MADE TO FACE A 
QUESTION OF WHERE DOES PUTTING 
IN POSITIONS OF POWER AND 
DECISION MAKING IN THIS 
COUNTRY, WE SHOULD LOOK THE 
QUESTION SQUARE IN THE FACE, 
DOES CHARACTER MATTER, DO OUR 
VALUES, OUR REAL VALUES ABOUT 
WHAT IS RIGHT AND WHAT IS WRONG 
AND ABOUT WHETHER WE TREAT OUR 
FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS WITH 
DIGNITY AND RESPECT, DO THEY 
MATTER ANYMORE? 
I BELIEVE THEY DO. 
AND I BELIEVE THE REACTION WE 
HAVE SEEN TO THIS COVERAGE 
RIGHT NOW AND YOUR COURAGE ALL 
OVER THIS COUNTRY SHOWS US THAT 
WE'RE NOT ALONE. 
YOU'RE NOT ALONE, THAT WOMEN 
AND MEN ALL ACROSS AMERICA ARE 
DISGUSTED AND SICK AND TIRED OF 
THE WAY BASIC HUMAN DECENCY HAS 
BEEN DRIVEN FROM OUR PUBLIC 
LIFE. 
THE PRESIDENT ADMITS ON TAPE TO 
ASSAULTING WOMEN. 
HE SEPARATES CHILDREN FROM 
THEIR PARENT, HE TAKES BASIC 
HEALTHCARE PROTECTIONS FROM 
THOSE WHO NEED THEM MOST, HE 
NOMINATES AND STANDS BEHIND A 
MAN WHO STANDS CREDIBLY ACCUSED 
OF A HORRIBLE ACT. 
I AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
COMING FORWARD. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I ASK UNANIMOUS 
CONSENT THAT SIX ITEMS 
CONSISTING OF VARIOUS 
STATEMENTS, LETTERS, FACT SHEET 
POSTS ARE INSERTED INTO THE 
RECORD. 
>> IS THAT ONE REQUEST OR YOU 
WANT ME TO WAIT FOR SIX? 
>> WELL, I HAVE SIX SEPARATE 
ITEMS. 
>> OKAY. 
>> I CAN GO OVER THEM FOR YOU. 
>> OKAY. 
NO. 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO -- 
>> LET ME NOT INTERRUPT YOU. 
YOUR REQUEST IS ACCEPTED 
WITHOUT OBJECTION. 
>> THANK YOU. 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO READ FROM 
AN ITEM THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN 
ENTERED INTO THE RECORD, BUT 
THIS IS FROM A LETTER FROM THE 
NATIONAL TASK FORCE TO END 
SEXUAL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
THE LETTER STATES, AND I QUOTE 
THIS LETTER, THIS MOMENT HAS 
BECOME A CREW CYBIL. 
IT'S A TEST OF OUR PROGRESS. 
DO WE START BY BELIEVING 
VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND 
TREATING THEM WITH DIGNITY OR 
DON'T WE? 
SO FAR SENATE LEADERS ARE 
FAILING THAT TEST. 
PREJUDGING THE OUTCOME OF THE 
HEARING, SYMPATHIZING WITH HER 
PERPETRATE ROR, -- PERPETRATOR, 
ATTACKING HER CREDIBILITY. 
THEY SEND A MESSAGE TO EVERY 
VICTIM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE THAT 
THEIR PAIN DOESN'T MATTER, THAT 
THEY DO NOT DESERVE JUSTICE AND 
THAT FOR THEM FAIR TREATMENT IS 
OUT OF REACH. 
THIS WILL ONLY SERVE TO DRIVE 
VICTIMS INTO THE SHADOWS AND 
FURTHER EMBOLDENING ABUSERS. 
ONCE AGAIN, DR. FORD, THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH. 
THIS IS A MOMENT FOR OUR 
COUNTRY. 
MAHALO. 
>> SENATOR -- MS. MITCHEL FOR 
SENATOR CRAPPO. 
>> GOOD AFTERNOON. 
>> HI. 
>> WHEN WE LEFT OFF WE WERE 
STILL TALKING ABOUT THE 
POLYGRAPH, AND I BELIEVE YOU 
SAID IT HASN'T BEEN PAID FOR 
YET, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> LET ME PUT AN END TO THIS 
MISERY, HER LAWYERS HAVE PAID 
FOR HER POLYGRAPH. 
>> AS IS ROUTINE. 
>> AS IS ROUTINE. 
>> DR. FORD, DO YOU EXPECT THAT 
THE PRICE OF THAT POLYGRAPH TO 
BE PASSED ON TO YOU? 
>> I'M NOT SURE YET. 
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A LOOK AT ALL 
OF THE CLASS INVOLVED IN THIS. 
WE'VE RELOCATED NOW -- ALL OF 
THE COSTS INVOLVED IN THIS. 
WE'VE NOW RELOCATEDTWICE, AND 
I HAVEN'T KEPT TRACK OF THIS 
PAPERWORK. 
BUT I'M SURE I HAVE A LOT OF 
WORK TO DO TO CATCH UP ON THAT 
LATER. 
>> I GET YOU HAVE A LOT GOING 
ON AND YOU'VE HAD THAT FOR 
SEVERAL MONTHS. 
BUT IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING 
THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO 
ASSIST YOU WITH SOME OF THESE 
FEES INCLUDING THE COSTS FOR 
YOUR POLYGRAPH? 
>> I'M AWARE THAT THERE'S BEEN 
SEVERAL GOFUNDME SITES THAT I 
HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FIGURE 
OUT HOW TO MANAGE THOSE BECAUSE 
I'VE NEVER HAD ONE. 
>> SEVERAL WHAT? 
>> GOFUNDME SITES THAT HAVE 
RAISED MONEY PRIMARILY FOR OUR 
SECURITY DETAIL, SO I'M NOT 
EVEN QUITE SURE HOW TO COLLECT 
THAT MONEY OR HOW TO DISTRIBUTE 
IT YET. 
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FOCUS ON 
THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
IN YOUR TESTIMONY THIS MORNING 
YOU STATED THAT SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN SENT YOU A LETTER ON 
AUGUST 31st OF THIS YEAR, IS 
THAT RIGHT? 
>> AUGUST 31st. 
LET ME SEE. 
I SENT HER A LETTER ON JULY 
30th, AND I DON'T HAVE THE 
DATE. 
I'D HAVE TO TO PULL UP MY E-
MAIL TO FIND OUT THE DATE OF 
HER E-MAIL TO ME SAYING -- IT 
WAS RIGHT BEFORE THE HEARINGS 
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO MAINTAIN 
THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE 
LETTER. 
>> SAY THAT AGAIN. 
IT WAS STILL RIGHT BEFORE THE 
HEARINGS? 
>> THAT'S MY MEMORY, BUT I CAN 
LOOK IT UP FOR YOU IF YOU'D 
LIKE THE EXACT DATE. 
I CAN PULL IT UP ON MY E-MAIL. 
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE -- 
>> EXACT DATE, COUNSEL? 
>> I WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID. 
>> THAT DOCUMENT HAS BEEN 
TURNED OVER IN RESPONSE TO 
REQUEST FOR DOCUMENTS. 
YOU HAVE IT. 
>> THANK YOU, COUNSEL. 
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I 
UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU SAID. 
WAS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING IT 
WAS GOING TO BE KEPT 
CONFIDENTIAL UP UNTIL RIGHT 
BEFORE THE HEARING? 
>> IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 
IT WAS GOING TO BE KEPT 
CONFIDENTIAL PERIOD. 
>> PERIOD? 
OKAY. 
BETWEEN YOUR POLYGRAPH ON 
AUGUST THE 7th AND YOUR RECEIPT 
OF THE LETTER FROM SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN, DID YOU OR ANYONE ON 
YOUR BEHALF SPEAK TO ANY MEMBER 
OF CONGRESS OR CONGRESSIONAL 
STAFF ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS? 
>> I PERSONALLY DID NOT. 
>> SO MY QUESTION WAS DID YOU 
OR ANYBODY ON YOUR BEHALF? 
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DID 
SOMEONE SPEAK FOR ME? 
>> SOMEBODY THAT IS WORKING 
WITH YOU OR HELPING YOU, DID 
SOMEBODY AT YOUR BEHEST ON YOUR 
BEHALF SPEAK TO SOMEBODY IN 
CONGRESS OR A STAFF? 
>> I'M NOT SURE. 
I'M NOT SURE HOW THOSE 
EXCHANGES WENT. 
BUT I DIDN'T SPEAK TO ANYONE. 
>> OKAY. 
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOMEBODY 
DID? 
>> I THINK SO, IT WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE. 
I'M GUESSING IT WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE, BUT I DON'T KNOW. 
>> EXCUSE ME. 
YOU ASKED HER NOT TO GUESS AND 
NOW YOU'RE ASKING HER WHAT'S 
POSSIBLE, SO I THINK IF YOU 
WANT TO ASK HER WHAT SHE KNOWS, 
YOU SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE 
KNOWS. 
>> IS THAT A REJECTION, 
COUNSEL? 
>> IT IS A REJECTION. 
>> I'LL HAVE THE CHAIR RULE ON 
THAT. 
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND. 
>> YOU SHOULD ANSWER THE 
QUESTION UNLESS THERE'S A LEGAL 
REASON FOR NOT ANSWERING IT ON 
ADVICE OF YOUR COUNSEL. 
>> SO I DON'T TOTALLY 
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION, BUT I 
DIDN'T SPEAK WITH ANYONE DURING 
THAT TIME FRAME OTHER THAN MY 
COUNSEL. 
>> OKAY. 
YOU'VE SAID REPEATEDLY THAT YOU 
DID NOT THINK THAT THAT LETTER 
THAT YOU WROTE ON JULY 30th WAS 
GOING TO BE RELEASED TO THE 
PUBLIC, IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> AND IS IT TRUE THAT YOU DID 
NOT AUTHORIZE IT TO BE RELEASED 
AT ANY TIME? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> OKAY. 
BESIDES YOUR ATTORNEYS, DID YOU 
PROVIDE -- YOU PROVIDED THAT 
LETTER TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>> I PROVIDED HER A LETTER ON 
JULY 30th. 
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE JULY 
30th LETTER. 
>> OKAY. 
>> AND YOU PROVIDED THAT LETTER 
TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN, CORRECT? 
>> UH-HUH. 
>> IS THAT A YES? 
>> YES. 
>> AND YOU PROVIDED THE LETTER 
TO REPRESENTATIVE ESHOO TO 
DELIVER IT TO SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN. 
>> YES. 
>> BESIDES THOSE TWO 
INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTATIVE 
ESHOO AND SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND 
YOUR ATTORNEYS, DID YOU PROVIDE 
THAT LETTER TO NIZ ONE ELSE? 
>> NO. 
-- TO ANYONE ELSE? 
>> NO. 
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT LETTER 
BECAME PUBLIC? 
>> NO. 
>> AFTER THAT LETTER WAS MADE 
PUBLIC OR LEAKED, DID YOU REACH 
BACK OUT TO THE "WASHINGTON 
POST"?
>> I REACHED OUT -- WELL, THEY 
WERE CONTINUOUSLY REACHING OUT 
TO ME, AND I WAS NOT 
RESPONDING, BUT THE TIME THAT I 
DID RESPOND AND AGREE TO DO THE 
SIT DOWN IS ONCE THE REPORTERS 
STARTED SHOWING UP AT MY HOME 
AND AT MY WORK PLACE. 
>> OKAY. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
DR. FORD, THANK YOU FOR BEING 
HERE. 
I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYONE 
THAT THIS IS NOT A COURTROOM, 
THIS IS NOT A LEGAL PROCEEDING, 
YOU'RE HERE UNDER YOUR OWN 
VOLUNTARY LITION, AND THOUGH 
THE PROSECUTOR HAS BEEN ENGAGED 
HERE TO REPRESENT MY 
COLLEAGUES, YOU'RE HERE AS YOU 
SAID OUT OF A CIVIC DUTY, AND I 
WANT TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES -- 
IT'S REALLY MORE THAN THAT. 
YOU KNOW, OUR FOUNDING 
DOCUMENTS TALK ABOUT CIVIC DUTY 
OR DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
TALKS ABOUT BEFORE THIS COUNTRY 
PLEDGING YOUR LIVES, YOUR 
FORTUNES AND YOUR SACRED HONOR. 
AND ANYBODY WHO'S READ YOUR 
TESTIMONY KNOWS WHAT YOU'VE HAD 
TO SACRIFICE BY COMING FORWARD. 
YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN UPENDED, 
YOU'VE RECEIVED VICIOUS HATEFUL 
THREATS, DETZ THREATS. 
YOU'VE HAD TO MOVE OUT OF YOUR 
FAMILY HOME, TO SOME EXPENSE, I 
IMAGINE, TO YOU AND YOUR 
FAMILY. 
YOU'VE HAD TO ENGAGE SECURITY 
TO SOME EXPENSE. 
YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH 
INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES. 
AND WHAT'S AMAZING AND I WANT 
TO JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN 
THANKING YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE 
AND BRAVERY COMING FORWARD TO 
HELP US DEAL WITH ONE OF THE 
MOST IMPORTANT OBLIGATIONS A 
SENATOR HAS, TO ADVISE AND 
CONSENT ON ONE OF THE BRANCHES 
OF OUR GOVERNMEN, THE HIGHEST 
COURTS IN THE LAND, AN 
INDIVIDUAL GOING BEFORE A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT. 
AND YOU EVEN SAID THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAD A LOT OF FOLKS ON 
THAT LIST AND YOUR FEAR WAS 
THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL WHO 
ASSAULTED YOU WOULD ASCEND TO 
THAT SEAT, THAT'S CORRECT, 
RIGHT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> YES. 
AND IT IS CORRECT THAT YOU HAVE 
GIVEN A LOT OF RESOURCES, TAKEN 
A LOT OF THREATS TO COME 
FORWARD, CORRECT? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> ASSAULTS ON YOUR DIGNITY AND 
YOUR HUMANITY? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> HOW HAS IT AFFECTED YOUR 
CHILDREN? 
>> THEY'RE DOING FAIRLY WELL 
CONSIDERING. 
THANK YOU FOR ASKING. 
>> AND YOUR HUSBAND? 
>> DOING FAIRLY WELL 
CONSIDERING, YEAH. 
THANK YOU. 
WE HAVE A VERY SUPPORTIVE 
COMMUNITY. 
>> THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR. 
I WANT TO USE A DIFFERENT WORD 
FOR YOUR COURAGE BECAUSE THIS 
IS MORE -- AS MUCH AS THIS 
HEARING IS ABOUT A SUPREME 
COURT JUSTICE, THE REALITY IS 
BY YOU COMING FORWARD, YOUR 
COURAGE, YOU ARE AFFECTING THE 
CULTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL NATION, AN 
INCREDIBLE CULTURE, BUT THERE 
ARE DARK ELEMENTS THAT ALLOW 
UNCONCHENNABLE LEVELS OF UN -- 
UNACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF SEXUAL 
ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
THAT ARE AFFECTING GIRLS AND 
BOYS AND AFFECTING MEN AND 
WOMEN FROM BIG MEDIA OUTLETS TO 
CORPORATIONS TO FACTORY FLOORS 
TO SERVERS IN RESTAURANTS TO 
OUR INTIMATE SPACES IN HOMES 
AND APARTMENTS ALL AROUND THIS 
COUNTRY. 
I STEPPED OUT DURING THE BREAK 
AND WAS DELUGED WITH NOTES FROM 
FRIENDS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, 
SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS THAT THERE 
ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WATCHING 
YOUR TESTIMONY RIGHT NOW AND 
NOTE AFTER NOTE THAT I GOT 
PEOPLE IN TEARS, FEELING PAIN 
AND ANGUISH, NOT JUST FEELING 
YOUR PAIN, BUT FEELING THEIR 
OWN WHO HAVE NOT COME FORWARD. 
YOU ARE OPENING UP TO OPEN-AIR 
HURT AND PAIN THAT GOES ON 
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. 
AND FOR THAT THE WORD I WOULD 
USE, IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF 
HEROIC BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING FOR OUR NATION RIGHT NOW 
BESIDES GIVING TESTIMONY 
GERMANE TO ONE OF THE MOST 
SACRED OBLIGATIONS OF OUR 
OFFICES IS YOU ARE SPEAKING 
TRUTH THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS 
TO UNDERSTAND. 
AND HOW WE DEAL WITH SURVIVORS 
WHO COME FORWARD RIGHT NOW IS 
UNACCEPTABLE, AND THE WAY WE 
DEAL WITH THIS, UNFORTUNATELY, 
ALLOWS FOR THE CONTINUED 
DARKNESS OF THIS CULTURE TO 
EXIST, AND YOUR BRILLIANCE, 
SHINING A LIGHT ONTO THIS AND 
SPEAKING YOUR TRUTH IS NOTHING 
SHORT OF HEROIC. 
BUT TO THE MATTER AT HAND, ONE 
OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO I HAVE A 
LOT OF RESPECT FOR AND I DO 
CONSIDER HIM A FRIEND WENT TO 
THE SENATE FLOOR AND SPOKE 
TRUTH TO BOTH SIDES OF THE 
POLITICAL AISLE, SENATOR FLAKE 
SAID YESTERDAY THIS IS A 
LIFETIME APPOINTMENT AND THIS 
IS SAID TO BE A DELIBERATIVE 
BODY. 
IN THE INTEREST OF DUE 
DILIGENCE AND FAIRNESS, HER 
CLAIMS MUST BE FULLY AIRED AND 
CONSIDERED, I AGREE WITH HIM. 
BUT YOU'VE ASKED FOR THINGS 
THAT WOULD GIVE A FULL AIRING 
FROM CORROBORATING WITNESSES TO 
BE CALLED, YOU'VE SBMITTED TO 
AN INTRUSIVE POLYGRAPH TEST. 
CAN YOU ANSWER FOR ME HOW DO 
YOU FEEL THAT ALL THE THINGS 
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE 
THOROUGHLY TO HELP THIS 
DELIBERATIVE BODY HAVE NOT BEEN 
HONORED IN THIS SO-CALLED 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> I WISH THAT I COULD BE MORE 
HELPFUL AND THAT OTHERS COULD 
BE MORE HOPEFUL AND THAT WE 
COULD COLLABORATE IN A WAY THAT 
WOULD GET AT MORE INFORMATION. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, I'D JUST LIKE TO 
INTRODUCE FOR THE RECORD SEVEN 
LETTERS FROM LAMB TO LEGAL FROM 
MORMON WOMEN FOR ETHICAL 
GOVERNMENT, YOUTH-LED 
ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THIS 
COUNTRY, THE INTERNATIONAL 
UNIONS, BRICK LAYERS, ALLIED 
CRAFT WORKERS, A LETTER FROM 
295 SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL 
VIOLENCE IN SUPPORT OF DR. FORD 
AND A LETTER FROM 1,600 MEN, 
IT'S A CAMPAIGN IN SUPPORT OF 
DR. FORD, AND THOSE WHO WANT TO 
ASSERT MEN AND WOMEN THAT 
SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE 
ARE NOT OPOR TUNISTS, DO NOT 
HAVE POLITICAL AXES TO GRIND, 
BUT ARE COMING FORWARD WITH 
COURAGE AND HEART TO SPEAK 
THEIR TRUTH IN TRYING TO END 
THE SCOURGE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AND VIOLENCE IN THIS COUNTRY. 
>> WITHOUT OBJECTION, SO 
ORDERED. 
SENATOR TILLIS, MS. MITCHELL 
FOR SENATOR TILLIS. 
>> DR. FORD, IN CHOOSING 
ATTORNEYS, DID ANYONE HELP YOU 
WITH THE CHOICE ON WHO TO 
CHOOSE? 
>> VARIOUS PEOPLE REFERRED ME 
TO LAWYERS THAT THEY KNEW IN 
THE WASHINGTON D.C. AREA, SO, 
AS YOU KNOW, I GREW UP IN THIS 
AREA, SO I ASKED SOME FAMILY 
MEMBERSAND FRIENDS, AND THEY 
WOULD -- THEY REFERRED ME TO 
LIKE DIVORCE ATTORNEYS THAT 
MIGHT KNOW SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT 
KNOW SOMEBODY AND ENDED UP 
INTERVIEWING SEVERAL LAW FIRMS 
FROM THE D.C. AREA. 
>> AND DID ANYBODY BESIDES 
FRIENDS AND FAMILY REFER YOU TO 
ANY ATTORNEYS? 
>> I THINK THAT THE STAFF OF 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE 
SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME ATTORNEYS. 
>> INCLUDING THE TWO THAT ARE 
SITTING ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU? 
>> NOT BOTH OF THEM, NO. 
>> OKAY. 
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATIONS. 
WHEN DID YOU PERSONALLY FIRST 
REQUEST AN F.B.I. 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> I GUESS WHEN WE FIRST 
STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A HEARING I WAS 
HOPING THAT THERE WOULD BE A 
MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION. 
>> WOULD THAT INVESTIGATION 
HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT YOU 
WOULD HAVE SUBMITTED TO AN 
INTERVIEW? 
>> I WOULD BE HAPPY TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE F.B.I., YES. 
>> WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO 
SUBMIT TO AN INTERVIEW BY STAFF 
MEMBERS FROM THIS COMMITTEE? 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
>> OKAY. 
BESIDES -- YOU MENTIONED SOME 
GOFUNDME ACCOUNTS. 
BESIDES THOSE, ARE THERE ANY 
OTHER EFFORTS OUTSIDE OF YOUR 
OWN PERSONAL FINANCES TO PAY 
FOR YOUR LEGAL FEES OR ANY OF 
THE COSTS INCURRED, ACCRUED? 
>> IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 
SOME OF MY TEAM IS WORKING ON A 
PRO BONO BASIS, BUT I DON'T 
KNOW THE EXACT DETAILS AND 
THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMUNITY IN PALO ALTO THAT 
HAVE THE MEANS TO CONTRIBUTE TO 
HELP ME WITH THE SECURITY 
DETAIL, ET CETERA. 
>> HAVE YOU BEEN PROVIDED -- 
>> I THINK I CAN HELP YOU WITH 
THAT. 
BOTH HER COUNSEL ARE DOING THIS 
PROBONO. 
WE ARE NOT BEING PAID AND WE 
HAVE NO EXPECTATION OF BEING 
PAID. 
>> THANK YOU, COUNSEL. 
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT I WAS GOING TO 
ASK YOU TODAY? 
>> NO. 
>> HAVE YOU -- YOU'VE BEEN 
ASKED A FEW QUESTIONS BY OTHER 
PEOPLE AS WELL. 
HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THOSE 
QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE? 
>> NO. 
>> HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD THEM IN 
ADVANCE? 
>> NO. 
>> AND LIKEWISE WITH MY 
QUESTIONS, HAVE YOU BEEN TOLD 
MY QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE? 
>> DEFINITELY NOT. 
>> OKAY. 
YOU MENTIONED ABOUT SOME 
POSSIBLE INFORMATION SUCH AS 
WHEN MARK JUDGE WORKED AT THE 
SUPERMARKET. 
I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMEONE 
ELSE. 
YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS A 
CLASSMATE WHO WAS REALLY SORT 
OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YOU 
AND BRETT KAVANAUGH. 
WHO WAS THIS PERSON? 
>> I THINK THAT THAT CASE WITH 
MR. WHALEN WHO WAS LOOKING AT 
MY LINKEDIN PAGE AND THEN 
TRYING TO BLAME THE PERSON, I 
JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S RIGHT 
FOR US TO BE TALKING ABOUT 
THAT. 
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO BLAME 
ANYBODY. 
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO THE 
COMMON FRIEND THAT YOU AND -- 
>> THE PERSON THAT MR. WHALEN 
WAS TRYING TO SAY LOOKED LIKE 
MR. KAVANAUGH. 
>> OKAY. 
HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW THIS 
PERSON? 
>> MAYBE A COUPLE OF MONTHS WE 
SOCIALIZED, BUT HE ALSO WAS A 
MEMBER OF THE SAME COUNTRY CLUB 
AND I KNEW HIS YOUNGER BROTHER 
AS WELL. 
>> OKAY. 
SO A COUPLE MONTHS BEFORE THIS 
TOOK PLACE? 
>> YES. 
>> OKAY. 
HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE YOUR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BOTH 
BEFORE AND AFTER THIS TOOK 
PLACE, THIS PERSON? 
>> HE WAS SOMEBODY THAT -- WE 
USE THE PHRASE I WENT OUT WITH, 
I WOULDN'T SAY DATE, I WENT OUT 
WITH FOR A FEW MONTHS. 
THAT'S HOW HE TERMED IT AT THE 
TIME. 
AND AFTER THAT WE WERE DISTANT 
FRIENDS AND RAN INTO EACH OTHER 
PERIODICALLY AT COLUMBIA 
COUNTRY CLUB, BUT I DIDN'T HIM 
OFTEN. 
I SAW HIS BROTHER AND HIM 
SEVERAL TIMES. 
>> WAS THIS PERSON THE ONLY 
COMMON LINK BETWEEN YOU AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 
>> HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT I 
WOULD BE ABLE TO NAME RIGHT NOW 
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO NOT NAME, 
BUT YOU KNOW WHO I MEAN. 
BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY OTHER 
MEMBERS OF COLUMBIA COUNTRY 
CLUB THAT WERE COMMON FRIENDS 
OR THERE WERE MORE 
ACQUAINTANCES 
>> BRIEFLY YES I CAN, DURING 
FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEAR, 
PARTICULARLY MY SOPHOMORE YEAR, 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEE HIS 
JUNIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL, 
FOUR OR FIVE PARTIES THAT MY 
FRIENDS AND I ATTENDED THAT 
WERE ATTENDED ALSO BY HIM.  
>> DID ANYTHING HAPPEN AT THESE 
EVENTS? 
LIKE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT? 
BESIDES THE TIME WE ARE TALKING 
ABOUT? 
>> YOU CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION 
AND THEN I WILL GO TO SENATOR 
HARRIS.  
GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. 
>>  THERE WAS NO SEXUAL ASSAULT 
AT ANY OF THOSE EVENTS.  
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE ASKING?  
>> YES.  
THOSE WERE JUST PARTIES. 
>>  OR ANYTHING INAPPROPRIATE 
IS WHAT I'M ASKING. 
>>  MAYBE WE CAN GO INTO MORE 
DETAIL WHEN THERE'S MORE TIME.  
I FEEL TIME PRESSURE ON THAT 
QUESTION.  
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER IN FURTHER 
DETAIL IF YOU WANT ME TO. 
>>  I'M SORRY.  GO AHEAD AND 
FINISH ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION. 
>>  OKAY.  
DID YOU WANT ME TO DESCRIBE 
THOSE PARTIES OR? 
>> SHOULD WE LEAVE THIS TO THE 
NEXT ROUND, MISTER CHAIRMAN? 
>> ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
>>  I'M JUST HAPPY TO DESCRIBE 
THEM IF YOU WANT TO ME TO OR 
I'M HAPPY TO NOT, JUST, 
WHATEVER YOU WANT.  
WHATEVER IS YOUR PREFERENCE. 
>>  MAYBE THIS WILL CUT TO THE 
CHASE BUT MY QUESTION IS WAS 
úT 
SEXUALLY INAPPROPRIATE? 
ANY INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL 
BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF MISTER 
KAVANAUGH TOWARDS YOU AT ANY OF 
THESE OTHER FUNCTIONS? 
>> NO. 
>>  SENATOR HARRIS? 
>> DOCTOR FORD, FIRST OF ALL, 
JUST SO WE CAN LEVEL THAT YOU 
KNOW YOU ARE NOT ON TRIAL.  
YOU ARE NOT ON TRIAL.  
YOU ARE SITTING HERE BEFORE 
MEMBERS OF THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
BECAUSE YOU HAD THE COURAGE TO 
COME FORWARD BECAUSE, AS YOU 
HAVE SAID, YOU BELIEVE IT WAS 
YOUR CIVIC DUTY.  
I WAS STRUCK IN YOUR TESTIMONY 
BY WHAT YOU INDICATED AS YOUR 
INTENTION WHEN YOU FIRST LET 
ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE 
HEARINGS KNOW ABOUT IT WHAT YOU 
BASICALLY SAID IS YOU REACHED 
OUT TO YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IN 
THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS 
HOPING THAT PERSON WOULD INFORM 
THE WHITE HOUSE BEFORE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH HAD BEEN NAMED.  
THAT'S EXTREMELY PERSUASIVE 
ABOUT YOUR MOTIVATION FOR 
COMING FORWARD.  
I WANT TO THANK YOU.  
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
COURAGE AND TELL YOU I BELIEVE 
YOU.  
I BELIEVE YOU.  
I BELIEVE MANY AMERICANS ACROSS 
THIS COUNTRY BELIEVE YOU.  
WHAT I FIND STRIKING ABOUT YOUR 
TESTIMONY IS YOU REMEMBER KEY 
SEARING DETAILS OF WHAT 
HAPPENED TO YOU.  
YOU TOLD YOUR HUSBAND AND 
THERAPIST, TWO OF THE MOST 
INTIMATE UP YOUR PAPA JOHN'S 
COME AND YOU TOLD THEM YEARS AGO
ABOUT THIS ASSAULT.  YOU HAVE 
SHARED YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH 
MULTIPLE FRIENDS YEARS AFTER 
THAT AND BEFORE.  
BEFORE THESE HEARINGSEVER 
STARTED.  
I KNOW HAVING PERSONALLY 
PROSECUTED SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES 
AND CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES 
THAT STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOW 
TRAUMA, SHAME, AND THE FEAR OF 
CONSEQUENCES ALMOST ALWAYS CAUSE
SURVIVORS TO AT THE VERY LEAST 
DELAY REPORTING, IF THEY EVER 
REPORT AT ALL.  
POLICE RECOGNIZE THAT.  
PROSECUTORS RECOGNIZE THAT 
MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH 
PROFESSIONALS RECOGNIZE THAT.  
THE NOTES FROM YOUR THERE BE 
SESSIONS WERE CREATED BEFORE 
THIS NOMINATION AND CORROBORATE 
WHAT YOU HAVE SAID TODAY.  úYOU 
SUBMITTED THE RESULTS TO THIS 
COMMITTEE.  
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS NOT.  
YOU HAVE CALLED FOR OUTSIDE 
WITNESSES TO TESTIFY AND FOR 
EXPERT WITNESSES TO TESTIFY.  
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS NOT.  
MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU HAVE 
CALLED FOR AN INDEPENDENT AND 
G.I. 
INVESTIGATION INTO THE FACTS.  
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS NOT.  
WE OWE YOU THAT.  
WE OWE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS SO 
IMPORTANT.  
CONTRARY TO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID 
TODAY, THE FBI DOES NOT REACH 
CONCLUSIONS.  THE FBI 
INVESTIGATES.  IT INTERVIEWS 
WITNESSES, GATHERS FACTS, AND 
PRESENT THAT INFORMATION TO THE 
UNITED STATES SENATE FOR OUR 
CONSIDERATION AND JUDGMENT THIS 
COMMITTEE KNOWS THAT IN SPITE 
OF WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD.  
IN 1991 DURING A SIMILAR HEARING
ONE OF MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES 
IN THIS COMMITTEE STATED THESE 
CLAIMS WERE TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY 
HAVING THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF 
INVESTIGATION'S LAUNCH AND 
INQUIRY TO DETERMINE THEIR 
VALIDITY.  
THE FBI FULFILLED ITS DUTY AND 
ISSUED A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT.  
THAT COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN DONE HERE.  
THIS MORNING IT WAS SAID THAT 
THIS COULD HAVE BEEN 
INVESTIGATED CONFIDENTIALLY 
BACK IN JULY.  
THIS ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN 
INVESTIGATED IN THE LAST 11 DAYS
SINCE YOU CAME FORWARD FORGET, 
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED.  
THE FBI COULD HAVE INTERVIEWED 
MARK JUDGE, PATRICK SMITH EMMA 
LEE LINDA KAISER, YOU, AND 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
ON THESE ISSUES.  
THE FBI COULD HAVE EXAMINED 
VARIOUS MAPS THAT HAVE BEEN 
PRESENTED BY THE PROSECUTOR WHO 
STANDS IN FOR THE UNITED STATES 
SENATORS ON THIS COMMITTEE.  
THE FBI COULD HAVE GATHERED 
FACTS ABOUT THE MUSIC OR THE 
CONVERSATION OR ANY OTHER 
DETAILS ABOUT THE GATHERING 
THAT OCCURRED THAT EVENING.  
THAT IS STANDARD PROCEDURE IN A 
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE.  
IN FACT, THE MANUAL THAT WAS 
SIGNED OFF BY MS. MITCHELL, THE 
MANUAL THAT IS POSTED ON THE 
MARICOPA COUNTY ATTORNEYS 
WEBSITE AS A GUIDING PRINCIPLE 
AND BEST PRACTICES FOR WHAT 
SHOULD HAPPEN WITH SEXUAL 
ASSAULT CASES HIGHLIGHTS THE 
DETAILS OF WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN 
IN TERMS OF THE NEED FOR AN 
OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO 
ANY SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE.  
IS AS EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION 
REQUIRES COOPERATION WITH A 
MULTIPLE DOSE A 
MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM INCLUDING
VICTIM AND -- VICTIM ADVOCATES, 
INTERVIEWERS, CRIMINALIST, AND 
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT MEMBERS.  
THE MANUAL ALSO STRESSES THE 
IMPORTANCE OF OBTAINING OUTSIDE 
WITNESS INFORMATION.  YOU HAVE 
BRAVELY COME FORWARD.  YOU HAVE 
BRAVELY COME FORWARD.  
I WENT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE YOU 
CLEARLY HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN 
WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.  YOU HAVE 
BEEN A TRUE PATRIOT INVITING 
FOR THE BEST OF WHO WE ARE AS A 
COUNTRY.  
I BELIEVE YOU ARE DOING THAT 
BECAUSE YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY 
AND I BELIEVE HISTORY WILL SHOW 
THAT YOU ARE A TRUE PROFILING 
IN COURAGE AT THIS MOMENT IN 
TIME IN OUR HISTORY OF OUR 
COUNTRY.  
I THINK YOU.  
>> SENATOR KENNEDY NOW, PROCEED 
MS. MITCHELL.  
>> DOCTOR FORD, WE ARE ALMOST 
DONE.  
JUST A COUPLE OF CLEANUP 
QUESTIONS WHICH OF YOUR TWO 
LAWYERS DID SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S 
OFFICE RECOMMEND? 
>> THE CATS FIRM.  
>> WHEN YOU DID LEAVE THAT 
NIGHT DID LINDA KAISER EVER 
FOLLOW-UP WITH YO SAY, HEY, 
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? 
>> I HAVE HAD COMMUNICATIONS 
WITH HER RECENTLY.  
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT LIKE THE 
NEXT DAY.  
>> NO, SHE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT 
THE EVENT ACTION WAS DOWNSTAIRS 
DURING THE EVENT AND I DID NOT 
SHARE IT WITH HER. 
>>  ARE YOU AWARE THAT THE 
THREE PEOPLE AT THE PARTY 
BESIDE YOURSELF AND BRETT 
KAVANAUGH HAVE GIVEN STATEMENTS 
UNDER PENALTY OF A FELONY TO 
THE COMMITTEE? 
>> YES EXPECT ARE YOU AWARE OF 
WHAT THOSE STATEMENTS SAY? 
>> YES. 
>>  ARE YOU AWARE THAT THEY SAY 
THEY HAVE NO MEMORY OR 
KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH A PARTY? 
>> YES.  
BACK TO YOU HAVE ANY PARTICULAR 
MOTIVES TO ASCRIBE TO LELAND? 
>> I GUESS WE COULD TAKE THOSE 
ONE AT A TIME.  
LELAND HAS SIGNIFICANT HEALTH 
CHALLENGES.  
I'M HAPPY SHE IS FOCUSING ON 
HERSELF AND GETTING THE HEALTH 
TREATMENT THAT SHE NEEDS.  SHE 
LET ME KNOW THAT SHE NEEDED HER 
LAWYER TO TAKE CARE OF THIS FOR 
HER.  
SHE TEXTED ME RIGHT AFTERWARD 
WITH AN APOLOGY AND GOOD WISHES 
ETC.  
I AM GLAD SHE IS TAKING CARE OF 
HERSELF.  
I DON'T EXPECT THAT PJ AND 
LELAND WOULD REMEMBER THIS 
EVENING.  
IT WAS A VERY UNREMARKABLE 
PARTY.  
IT WAS NOT ONE OF THEIR MORE 
NOTORIOUS PARTIES BECAUSE 
NOTHING REMARKABLE HAPPENED TO 
THEM THAT EVENING.  
THEY WERE DOWNSTAIRS . THE 
MISTER JUDGE, THIS IS A 
DIFFERENT STORY, I WOULD EXPECT 
THAT HE WOULD REMEMBER THAT 
THIS HAPPENED. 
>>  UNDERSTOOD.  
>> SENATOR HARRIS JUST 
QUESTIONED UP FROM THE MARICOPA 
COUNTY PROTOCOL ON SEXUAL 
ASSAULT.  
THAT IS THE PAPER SHE WAS 
HOLDING UP.  
ARE YOU AWARE THAT, YOU KNOW, I 
HAVE BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED 
TODAY BECAUSE YOU HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT EPINEPHRINE AND CORTISOL 
AND WHAT WE CALL IN THE 
PROFESSION, BASICALLY, THE 
NEUROBIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF 
TRAUMA.  
HAVE YOU ALSO EDUCATED YOURSELF 
ON THE BEST WAY TO GET TO 
MEMORY AND TRUTH IN TERMS OF 
INTERVIEWING THE HOMES OF 
TRAUMA? 
>> FOR ME INTERVIEWING VICTIMS 
OF TRAUMA? 
>> NO.  
THE BEST WAY TO DO IT.  
THE BEST PRACTICES FOR 
INTERVIEWING VICTIMS OF TRAUMA. 
>>  NO.  
STUCK WOULD YOU BELIEVE ME IF I 
TOLD YOU THAT THERE IS NO STUDY 
THAT SAYS THE SETTING IN FIVE 
MINUTE INCREMENTS IS THE BEST 
WAY TO DO THAT? 
>> WE COULD STIPULATE TO THAT. 
>>  THANK YOU, CANCEL. 
>>  AGREED. 
>>  DID YOU KNOW THAT THE BEST 
WAY TO DO IT IS TO HAVE A 
TRAINED INTERVIEWER TALK TO YOU 
ONE-ON-ONE IN A PRIVATE SETTING 
AND TO LET YOU DO THE TALKING? 
JUST LET YOU DO A NARRATIVE.  
DID YOU KNOW THAT? 
>> THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.  
>> IT DOES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. 
DOESN'T IT? 
TO FOLLOW-UP AND FILL IN THE 
DETAILS AND ASK FOR 
CLARIFICATION DOES NOT MAKE 
SENSE AS WELL? 
>> YES. 
>>  THE RESEARCH IS DONE BY A 
LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE CHILD 
ABUSE FIELD, TWO OF THE MORE 
PROMINENT ONES IN THE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT FIELD ARE GEISEL AND 
FISHER WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IT. 
IT IS CALL A COGNITIVE 
INTERVIEW.  
THIS IS NOT A COGNITIVE 
INTERVIEW.  
DID ANYBODY EVER ADVISED YOU 
FROM SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S OFFICE 
OR FROM REPRESENTATIVE ASHER'S 
OFFICE TO GO GET A FORENSIC 
INTERVIEW? 
>> NO.  
>> INSTEAD, YOU ARE GUYS TO GET 
AN ATTORNEY AND TAKE A 
POLYGRAPH.  
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>> MANY PEOPLE ADVISED ME TO 
GET AN ATTORNEY.  
ONCE I HAD AN ATTORNEY MY 
ATTORNEY AND I DISCUSSED USING 
THE POLYGRAPH. 
>>  INSTEAD OF SUBMITTING TO AN 
INTERVIEW IN CALIFORNIA FOR 
HAVING -- WE ARE HAVING A 
HEARING HERE TODAY IN FIVE 
MINUTE INCREMENTS.  
IS THAT RIGHT? 
>> I AGREED THAT IS WHAT WAS 
AGREED UPON BY THE COLLEGIAL 
GROUP HERE. 
>>  OKAY.  
THANK YOU.  
I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS 
EXPECT I HAVE SOMETHING TO 
SUBMIT FOR THE RECORD.  WE 
RECEIVED THREE STATEMENTS UNDER 
PENALTY OF MONEY FROM THREE 
WITNESSES IDENTIFIED BY DOCTOR 
FORD.  MARK JUDGE, LELAND 
KAISER, AND PATRICK SMITH.  
ALL THREE DENIED ANY KNOWLEDGE 
OF THE INCIDENT OR GATHERING 
DESCRIBED BY DOCTOR FORD 
WITHOUT OBJECTION I WILL ENTER 
IN THE RECORD.  
>> MISTER CHAIRMAN, I HAVE 
SOMETHING FOR THE RECORD AS 
WELL.  
A NUMBER OF LETTERS FROM THE 
WITNESSES FAMILY, FRIENDS, 
INCLUDING HER HUSBAND.  
>> OKAY.  
I WILL GET TO YOU AS SOON AS 
THE RANKING MEMBER 
>> MISTER CHAIRMAN, I HAVE 
THREE LETTERS ADDRESSED TO BOTH 
YOU AND THE RANKING MEMBER AND 
I WOULD ASK THEY BE ENTERED 
INTO THE RECORD. 
>>  WITHOUT OBJECTION.  
>> IT IS ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING 
THAT MISTER JUDGE IS NOT 
WILLING TO COME FORWARD TO 
ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS.  
AS A RESULT WE CANNOT TEST HIS 
MEMORY OR MAKE ANY ASSESSMENT 
OF HIS THOUGHTFULNESS WERE CARE
.  I THINK THAT IS WHY THE 
FAILURE TO CALL HIM TO TESTIFY 
IS SO VERY CRITICAL.  I HOPE 
THE MAJORITY WOULD RECONSIDER 
THAT.  
>> SENATOR BLUMENTHAL. 
>>  MISTER CHAIRMAN, I ASK IF 
YOU HAVE SWORN STATEMENTS THAT 
YOU ARE SUBMITTING FOR THE 
RECORD THAT WE HAVE THOSE 
INDIVIDUALS COME BEFORE US SO 
WE CAN ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THOSE STATEMENTS.  
I THINK THE NATURE OF THIS 
PROCEEDING WOULD BE COMPROMISED 
IF WE LACK AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
ASK THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT SWORN 
STATEMENTS THAT WOULD BE PART 
OF THE RECORD.  
FRANKLY, MISTER CHAIRMAN, I 
WOULD OBJECT TO ENTERING THEM 
INTO THE RECORD. 
>>  MISTER CHAIRMAN -- 
>> SENATOR WHITEHOUSE. 
>>  I HAVE A NUMBER OF LETTERS 
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK 
SUBMITTED TO THE RECORD THAT 
RELATE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF 
PROPER INVESTIGATION BY TRAINED 
PROFESSIONALS IN PULLING THESE 
KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS TOGETHER 
FROM THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE 
ON CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS, THE 
NATIONAL WOMEN'S LAW CENTER, 
THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR 
WOMEN, AND SO FORTH. 
>>  SENATOR KENNEDY. 
>>  ESTHER CHAIRMAN, I HAVE A 
QUESTION.  
THE STATEMENTS THAT SENATOR 
BLUMENTHAL TALKED ABOUT SOME OF 
THOSE WERE STATEMENTS TAKEN BY 
HOUR MAJORITY STAFF. 
>>  THEY ARE ALREADY IN THE 
RECORD. 
>>  YES,SIR, THOSE STATEMENTS 
WERE TAKEN BY HOUR MAJORITY 
STAFF. 
>>  YES. 
>>  DID MY -- DID MINORITY STEP 
IT IS.?  
>> NO. 
>>  WHY NOT. 
>>  YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK THAT. 
>>  WERE THEY INSTRUCTED NOT TO 
PRODUCE.?  
>> NO.  
>> H -- THEY CHOSE NOT TO? 
>> THAT'S RIGHT. 
>>  IF I MAY, MISTER CHAIRMAN 
-- 
>> IF I COULD I STILL THINK I 
HAVE THE FLOOR. 
>>  LET'S LISTEN TO SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN EXPECT CAN WE BE 
EXCUSED? 
>> THE WITNESS IS QUITE TIRED.  
>> IF YOU WOULD WAIT JUST A 
MINUTE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK 
DOCTOR FORD. 
>>  ALL RIGHT. 
>>  IN FACT, WE ARE GOING TO 
CONTINUE THIS MEETING.  
LET'S JUST BE NICE TO HER.  
DOCTOR FORD, I CAN ONLY SPEAK 
AS ONE OF 21 SENATORS HERE.  
I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
TESTIMONY.  
MORE IMPORTANTLY, FOR YOUR 
BRAVERY COMING OUT AND TRYING 
TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS AS BEST 
YOU COULD REMEMBER.  
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  
WE WILL ADJOURN FOR 45 MINUTES 
-- NOT ADJOURN, RECESS FOR 45 
MINUTES.
S.
>> THERE IT IS A 45 MINUTE BREAK
CALLED BY CHAIRMAN CHUC
>> THERE IT IS.  
A 45 MINUTE BREAK CALLED BY 
CHAIRMAN CHUCK GRASSLEY AS WE 
CONTINUE TO WATCH THE CAPITAL 
HEARINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN GOING 
SINCE 10:00 THIS ONE.  
WE EXPECT THEM TO GO ON DAY.  
YOU ARE WATCHING CBS NEWS WITH 
THE HEARINGS NOW IN THEIR 50 
CALIBER COLLEGE PROFESSOR 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD IS WERE I 
TO NOTE THAT SUPREME COURT 
NOMINEE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER WHEN 
THEY WERE TEENAGERS . THE 
COMMITTEE WILL HEAR FROM HIM 
LATER TODAY JOINING ME IN OUR 
COVERAGE IS GAYLE KING.  
AND JOHN DICKERSON.  
ALSO CBS NEWS LEGAL ANALYST 
RICKY KLEEMAN AND JAN CRAWFORD 
WHO COVERS THE SUPREME COURT, 
CBS THIS MORNING COHOST NORAH 
O
WELL.  
AND POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ED 
O
HEARING ROOM.  RICKY, TO YOU 
FIRST WHAT HAS CHANGED IN THE 
LAST HOUR AND A HALF AGO 
>> I THINK THAT THE LAST BIT OF 
EXAMINATION BY RACHEL MILLER, 
THE HIRED PROSECUTOR ON BEHALF 
OF THE REPUBLICANS WAS POWERFUL 
IN RAISING A POSSIBLE DOUBT 
ABOUT THE WITNESSES TESTIMONY.  
IF SHE HAD GOTTEN TO THAT A LOT 
SOONER SHE COULD HAVE DEVELOPED 
IT.  
WHAT SHE WAS REALLY TRYING TO 
SAY IS THAT IT IS ALL ABOUT 
MEMORY.  
IF YOU, PERHAPS, HAD GONE TO A 
FORENSIC EXAMINER AND DONE IT 
THE RIGHT WAY THAT PERHAPS YOU 
WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IT 
CORRECTLY AND A PERSON WOULD 
NOT HAVE BEEN BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WAY TOO 
LITTLE WAY TOO LATE. 
>>  IN OTHER WORDS, SHE WAS 
SAYING THAT IF A PROPER FORENSIC
, THE WAY SHE PREFERS TO DO IT, 
RACHEL MITCHELL, AFTER A TRAUMA,
IF IT WAS DONE THAT WAY AS 
OPPOSED TO THE POLYGRAPH TEST 
POSSIBLY SHE COULD HAVE 
REMEMBERED EVEN MORE. 
>>  SHE COULD HAVE REMEMBERED 
EVEN MORE.  
PERHAPS SHE COULD HAVE 
REMEMBERED IT DIFFERENTLY.  
THE ONE THING IT DOES NOT SHAKE 
HIS THIS, YOU HAVE A WOMAN WHO 
SAYS THAT SHE IS 100% SURE IT 
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
SHE KNEW BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
IT IS NOT LIKE SHE PICKED A 
STRANGER OUT OF A LINEUP OF 
SOMEONE SHE HAD NEVER MET.  
IT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO 
BE IN THE POSITION OF THE 
PROSECUTOR TO TRY TO UNDERMINE 
THE CREDIBILITY.  
YOU ARE BACK TO WHERE JAN WAS, 
WHICH WAS REALLY, IF YOU'RE NOT 
UNDERMINING CREDIBILITY AND 
SHOWING THAT SHE IS LYING OR 
MISTAKEN, I THINK LYING IS WAY 
OFF THE TABLE, SHE'S NOT LYING, 
THAT SHE IS MISTAKEN, THAT 
REALLY DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 
GOAL, WHICH IS THE POLITICAL 
GOAL THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE 
TIMING THAT MAY BE SOMETHING 
THAT WOULD BE USED BY THE 
POLITICIANS AFTER THIS? 
>> HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED 
REMEMBER SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY 
IF YOU KNOW THE PERSON WHO 
ASSAULTED YOU? 
>> THAT'S WHAT I SAY.  
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT 
SHE'S GETTING AT. 
>>  WHAT SHE'S GETTING AT IS 
THAT SOMETIMES WE IMPRINTING 
MEMORY IN A WAY THAT WE 
REMEMBER THE MEMORY AND NOT THE 
FACT THAT THE PROBLEM IS SHE 
KNEW HIM.  
SO QUICKLY TO BOTH OF YOU, 
APOLOGIES.  
JOHN CORNYN IS SPEAKING RIGHT 
NOW.  
WE ARE HEARING FOR THE FIRST 
TIME FROM SOME OF THE SENATORS. 
>>  OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A TOUGH 
SETTING FOR ANY WITNESS.  I 
THOUGHT IT WENT AS WELL AS YOU 
COULD EXPECT . THE IS 
ESSENTIALLY, WHAT WE HEARD IS 
AN ARTICULATION OF WHAT WE 
ALREADY SAW IN HER -- 
>> SENATOR, YOU HANDLED THE 
VOTE COUNTS AROUND HERE.  BASED 
ON WHAT WAS SAID THIS MORNING 
BY HER DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE YET
OF WHETHER YOU HAVE WHAT YOU 
NEED? 
>> I THINK WE NEED TO HEAR FROM 
THE JUDGE, HIS REPUTATION IS ON 
THE LINE . HIS CAREER AS WELL.  
THIS NEEDS TO BE A FAIR PROCESS 
TO BOTH DOCTOR FORD AND JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH.  
EXPECTED ANY OF YOU -- EXPECTED 
YOU PERSONALLY FIND HER TO BE 
CREDIBLE? 
>> I FOUND NO REASON TO FIND 
HER NOT CREDIBLE.  
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE GAPS IN HER 
STORY.  
OBVIOUSLY, WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE 
TRAUMATIZED.  
THEY HAVE THOSE SORT OF GAPS.  
AGAIN, I REGRET THAT SHE FINDS 
HERSELF IN HIS CIRCUS -LIKE 
SETTING.  
HER LETTER TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN 
WAS RELEASED TO THE PRESS 
AGAINST HER KNOWLEDGE AND 
WITHOUT HER AUTHORIZATION.  SHE 
WAS NOT TOLD BY HER LAWYERS 
THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN 
INTERVIEWED IN A PRIVATE SETTING
BY INVESTIGATORS ON BOTH SIDES 
AND GET HER TESTIMONY THAT WAY. 
I THOUGHT SHE DID JUST FINE. 
>>  ARE YOU PLEASED WITH RACHEL 
MITCHELL'S -- 
>> I THINK SHE DID EXACTLY WHAT 
I HOPED SHE WOULD DO, THAT IS A 
DIGNIFIED AND PROFESSIONAL WAY 
TO ASK QUESTIONS TO GET 
INFORMATION.  
I WOULD SAY MOST OF THE 
COMMENTS MADE BY OUR FRIENDS 
ACROSS THE AISLE STRUCK ME AS 
MORE POLITICAL.  THEY DIDN'T 
REALLY ASK QUESTIONS SEEKING 
INFORMATION.  
WE ARE INTERESTED IN GETTING TO 
THE TRUTH.  
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS A HYPER 
POLITICIZED ENVIRONMENT.  
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. 
>>  SENATOR GRAHAM, I WILL ASK 
YOU, SHE SEEMED TOWARD THE ENDS
, MS. MITCHELL, TO BE 
QUESTIONING THE POLITICAL 
MOTIVES OF DOCTOR FORD'S 
ATTORNEYS.  
BY RAISING QUESTIONS -- 
>> I'M REALLY UPSET THAT THEY 
KNEW ABOUT THIS IN AUGUST AND 
NEVER TOLD ANYBODY.  
I'M REALLY UPSET THAT DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN BELIEVED THIS WAS A 
CREDIBLE ALLEGATION AND THAT 
SHE WOULDN'T DO MISTER JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH THE SERVICE OF SAYING 
I HAVE GOT THIS FOR WHAT IS 
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY? 
TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMITTEE 
SO WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING NOT AS 
CLOSE TO THE MIDTERMS.  WHEN 
THEY SAY SHE WASN'T SURE WE 
WERE WILLING TO GO OUT THERE 
THAT IS A BUNCH OF BULL.  
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY TOLD MS. 
FORD, BUT WE WERE WILLING TO GO 
TO CALIFORNIA.  
WE WERE TOLD SHE COULDN'T FLY.  
ALL I CAN SAY IS WE ARE 40 
SOMETHING DAYS AWAY FROM THE 
ELECTION AND THEIR GOAL, NOT 
MS. FORD SCHOOL, IS TO LAY THIS 
PAST THE MIDTERMS SO THEY CAN 
WIN THE SENATE AND NEVER 
ALLOWED TRUMP TO FILL THE SEAT. 
I BELIEVE THAT MET -- NOW MORE 
THAN EVER.  
I DON'T KNOW WHO PAID FOR HER 
POLYGRAPH BUT SOMEBODY DID.  
THE FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE 
SET IT UP TO BE JUST THE WAY IT 
IS.  
I FEEL AMBUSHED AS THE MAJORITY
.  WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM 
ESTHER KAVANAUGH, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, AND I HAVE BEEN A 
JUDGE, A PROSECUTOR, AND A 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY.  
WHEN IT COMES TO WHERE IT 
HAPPENED I STILL DON'T KNOW I 
DON'T KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENED.  
SHE SAID SHE IS 100% CERTAIN IT 
DID HAPPEN.  
I WOULD BET YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
WILL SAY I'M 100% SURE I DIDN'T 
DO IT.  THE PEOPLE NAMED SAY 
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT MS. FORD 
IS TALKING ABOUT.  
SHE CAN'T TELL US HOW SHE GOT 
HOME OR HOW SHE GOT THERE.  
THOSE ARE THE FACTS I'M LEFT 
WITH.  
A NICE LADY WHO HAS COME 
FORWARD TO TELL A HARD STORY 
THAT IS UNCORROBORATED.  
THIS IS ENOUGH, GOD HELP 
ANYBODY ELSE THAT GETS 
NOMINATED, BASED ON WHAT I 
HEARD TODAY YOU COULD NOT GET A 
SEARCH WARRANT OR AN ARREST 
WARRENT BECAUSE SHE DON'T KNOW 
THE LOCATION OR THE TIME AND 
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CORROBORATION
AS TO MS. MITCHELL -- MS. 
MITCHELL, THAT'S WHAT I HOPED 
SHE WOULD DO.  
I HEARD A BUNCH OF SPEECHES 
FROM A BUNCH OF POLITICIANS WHO 
HAVE POLITICIZED THIS FROM DAY 
ONE.  
WHO HAVE BEEN LYING IN WAIT FOR 
A POLITICAL PURPOSE.  
NOT MS. FORD, BUT, CERTAINLY 
THEM, MAKING A BUNCH OF 
SPEECHES . THE IS MITCHELL 
METHODICALLY WENT TO THE FACTS 
OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY, 
LEADING UP TO THAT DAY, AND HOW 
WE FIND OURSELVES HERE.  
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I'M 
PLEASED WITH WHAT I SAW. 
>>  DO YOU STILL WANT TO VOTE 
ON FRIDAY? 
>> WITH YOUR OWN BACKGROUND AS 
A PROSECUTOR, DEFENSE ATTORNEY, 
AND JUDGE DID YOU FIND DOCTOR 
FOR TO BE CREDIBLE -- CREDIBLE? 
>> I DID NOT FIND HER 
ALLEGATIONS TO BE CORROBORATED 
AGAINST MISTER KAVANAUGH.  
SHE IS SAYING IT IS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH BUT SHE CAN'T TELL ME 
THE HOUSE, CITY, THE MONTH OF 
THE YEAR.  
HE IS SAYING I DIDN'T DO IT.  
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU 
HAVE AN EMOTIONAL ACCUSATION 
AND AN EMOTIONAL DENIAL, USE 
THE RULE OF LAW, THE 
PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE 
ATTACHES TO THE PERSON ACCUSED. 
YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM NOTICE AND
TIME AND LOCATION.  
YOU ASK IS THERE ANYBODY TO 
VERIFY THIS? 
WHEN YOU GIVE NAMES ALL OF THEM 
GO THE OTHER WAY.  
HAVING SAID THAT, WHAT DO I 
THINK ABOUT MS. FORD? 
VERY COMPETENT ACCOMPLISHED 
LADY.  
SOMETHING HAPPENED.  
I DON'T KNOW WHAT.  
YOU ARE ASKING ME TO SAVE IT 
WAS BRETT KAVANAUGH AND I DON'T 
KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENED, WHERE IT 
HAPPENED, HE SAID IT DIDN'T 
HAPPEN.  
I WOULD SAY THIS BUT I THINK IT 
WAS A GOOD SUGGESTION FOR HER 
TO GO TALK TO SOMEBODY TO WORK 
THROUGH THIS.  
>> HOW IS THAT NOT ALL AN 
ARGUMENT FOR A AND MORE FULSOME 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> IF YOU REALLY BELIEVED WE 
NEEDED AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS 
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US IN 
AUGUST? 
LISTEN.  
THE FBI IS GOING TO TELL US 
WHAT.  
WHAT HOUSE ARE THEY GOING TO GO 
TO? 
WHAT CITY ARE THEY GOING TO GO 
TO? 
WHO ARE THEY GOING TO TALK TO? 
THEY CAN'T TELL US THE MONTH 
MIGHT BARELY THE YEAR.  
THIS IS ALL DELAY.  
>> DID MISTER JUDGE TELL YOU 
THAT? 
>> MISTER JUDGE.  
THEY SAY I DIDN'T DO IT I DON'T 
KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.  
THEY WANT TO CALL 25 PEOPLE WHO 
SAY HE'S AN ABUSER.  
WE WILL BE PAST THE MIDTERM.  
I'M NOT GOING TO REWARD PEOPLE 
FOR PLAYING A POLITICAL GAME.  
I THINK WITH HER LIFE SHE IS 
JUST AS MUCH A VICTIM IN THIS 
AS I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH IS.  
SOMEBODY BETRAYED HER TRUST.  
WE KNOW WHO SHE GET THE LETTER 
TO THE PEOPLE THAT BETRAYED HER 
TRUST OVER AN APOLOGY. 
>>  DO YOU STILL WANT TO VOTE 
ON FRIDAY? 
>> JEFF, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU 
HEAR ME, BUT, OBVIOUSLY, IT 
JUST UP SENATOR GRAHAM THERE 
WHO CLEARLY IS UPSET ABOUT WHAT 
TRANSPIRED AND BELIEVES THERE 
IS HOLES IN HER ARGUMENT.  
HE'S NOT THE ONLY REPUBLICAN 
THAT SAID THAT.  
I SPOKE WITH ANOTHER COMMITTEE 
MEMBER EARLIER WHO SAID 
PRIVATELY THAT THEY ARE 
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WHOLE 
ABOUT HOW IT IS SHE DOESN'T 
REMEMBER OR DOESN'T KNOW HOW 
SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT.  HOW 
IS IT THAT SHE WAS AFRAID TO FLY
BUT SOMEHOW ENDS UP HERE IN 
WASHINGTON? 
HURTS HE WON'T TELL US HOW SHE 
GOT HERE.  SHE POINTS OUT 
DURING HER TESTIMONY SHE HAD 
FLOWN A FEW TIMES TO THE EAST 
COAST.  THERE ARE HOLES IN HER 
ARGUMENT.  
REPUBLICANS AGREE SHE CAME 
ACROSS AS LIKABLE AND CREDIBLE 
AND THEY EXPECT THE JUDGE TO 
HOPEFULLY DO THAT AS WELL THIS 
AFTERNOON.  
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  
GREAT JOB WITH THOSE QUESTIONS 
AND THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING TO 
BOTH OF THEM.  
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM WITH THE 
SECOND AND BY FAR THE STRONGEST 
REACTION SO FAR TO WHAT WE SAW 
THIS MORNING AND EARLY THIS 
AFTERNOON.  
SENATOR GRAHAM SAYING I FEEL 
AMBUSHED.  GOING AFTER NOT 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, BUT THE 
DEMOCRATS AND ASSAYING THIS WAS 
CRITICALLY MOTIVATED IN THE WAY 
IT WAS ORCHESTRATED, THE TIMING
, ALL MEANT TO DELAY THE PROCESS
.  SO IT WOULD BE PUSHED PAST 
THE MIDTERMS OR EVEN FAR BEYOND 
THAT.  
SOME WIRY LANGUAGE THEREFROM 
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM.  HE DID 
NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION OF 
WHETHER HE IS STILL STILL 
CALLING FOR A VOTE TOMORROW, 
WHICH WOULD THEN POTENTIALLY 
LEAD TO A FINAL VOTE AND 
POTENTIALLY CONFIRMATION OF 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH EARLY 
NEXT WEEK.  IF THAT WERE TO 
HAPPEN.  
WE HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH.  
THAT WILL TAKE PLACE THIS 
AFTERNOON AFTER CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD'S TESTIMONY JUST 
WRAPPED UP.  
WE DEALT WITH THREE SESSIONS 
WHERE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ALL 
HAD A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS 
AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY 
REPUBLICAN DEFERRED TO THE 
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR RACHEL 
MITCHELL WHO TOOK CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD THROUGH A TIMELINE 
OF WHAT SHE SAYS HAPPENED BACK 
IN THE EARLY 80s.  SHE ALSO 
QUESTION WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE 
IN JUST THE PAST FEW MONTHS.  
NWORA IS ON CAPITOL HILL AND 
HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS ALL 
MORNING AND AFTERNOON.  
NWORA, DO WE HAVE DICK DURBIN 
RIGHT NOW? 
LET'S LISTEN TO THAT. 
>>  TERRIFIED.  
I THOUGHT SHE HANDLED THE 
QUESTIONS PROFESSIONALLY AND 
HONESTLY.  VOLUNTEERED ANSWERS 
WHEN SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO I 
THOUGHT SHE MADE A VERY 
CREDIBLE PRESENTATION. 
>>  DO YOU THINK IT BACKFIRED 
ON THE REPUBLICANS TO HAVE AN 
OUTSIDE COUNSEL QUESTIONING? 
>> WELL, IF YOU LISTEN TO THE 
PROSECUTOR'S CONCLUSION DOING 
AN INTERIEW IN FIVE MINUTE 
SEGMENTS IS NOT RECOMMENDED.  
YOU CAN TELL THAT SHE WAS 
FRUSTRATED.  
I COULDN'T FOLLOW HER LINE OF 
THINKING.  I TRIED TO 
UNDERSTAND WHERE SHE WAS COMING 
FROM.  
IT SEEMED SO OBLIQUE AND SO 
FRAGMENTED.  
I NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD WHAT 
SHE WAS TRYING TO SAY.  
>>
>> THE THING WE NEED TO HEAR 
THE MOST IS WHAT IS OBVIOUS.  
IF THERE IS NO EVIDENCE AND 
THERE ARE NO WITNESSES TO BACK 
UP WHAT SHE JUST TOLD US UNDER 
OATH WHY AREN'T YOU SUPPORTING 
AN INVESTIGATION BY THE FBI? 
WHAT YOU WANT TO CLEAR YOUR NAME
AND MAKE SURE THAT THE COURTS 
-- WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO CLEAR 
YOUR NAME AND MAKE SURE THAT 
THE COURTS HAVE NO SHADOW OF 
SUSPICION? 
>> DICK DURBIN'S REACTION TO 
WHAT HE HAS HEARD TODAY.  
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS, THE 
PROSECUTOR RACHEL MITCHELL 
ABOUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO 
HEAR THE END IS RACHEL MITCHELL 
AT THE END OF HER QUESTIONING, 
THE PROSECUTOR.  
BY REPUBLICANS WAS ESSENTIALLY 
UNDERCUTTING THE STRATEGY BEEN 
PICKED BY REPUBLICANS AND 
SAYING THERE IS NOT A LOT I CAN 
DO IN FIVE MINUTE SEGMENTS WHEN 
I AM THEN INTERRUPTED.  THERE'S 
NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PLACES TO GO
.  AS SHE FINISHED UP HER 
QUESTIONING OF CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD THIS MORNING.  
YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT A LOT AS 
WELL AND THE CHALLENGE THAT SHE 
FACED IN TRYING TO GET 
INFORMATION HERE. 
>>  I DON'T ENVY HER POSITION.  
SHE HAD TWO DUTIES.  
ONE WAS TO TRY TO UNDERMINE THE 
CREDIBILITY OF DOCTOR FORD IN 
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, WHETHER IT 
WAS TO HER MEMORY OR TWO, IN 
FACT, WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS 
TELLING THE TRUTH . THE SECOND 
ONE WAS TO CARRY OUT THE 
POLITICAL AGENDA OF THE 
REPUBLICANS WHO HIRED HER.  
WHICH, CLEARLY, SHE DID MUCH OF 
HER EXAMINATION DEALING WITH 
THE TIMING OF THE LETTERS, THE 
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE 
REPRESENTATIVE, AND THEN WITH 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN.  
AND THEN HER GETTING A LAWYER 
AND THEN THE POLYGRAPH.  
WHAT SHE IS TRYING TO DO IS 
GIVE THE REPUBLICANS COVER FOR 
THOSE WHO WOULD REALLY LIKE TO 
SAY THIS IS ALL A DEMOCRATIC 
PROBLEM.  
DID SHE DO THAT? 
IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR 
SENATOR DURBIN SAY I HAD A HARD 
TIME FOLLOWING HER LINE OF 
QUESTIONING. 
>>  RACHEL MITCHELL. 
>>  YEAH.  
IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW 
RACHEL MITCHELL BECAUSE OF THE 
FIVE-MINUTE INTERVALS.  
WE SAW IT IN THE VERY FIRST 
SEGMENT WHEN SHE WAS TRYING TO 
DO WITH THREE ISSUES THAT 
NEEDED EDITING IN A DOCUMENT OR 
CORRECTIONS IN DOCUMENT AND SHE 
COULDN'T EVEN GET TO THE THIRD 
ONE. 
>>  I THINK WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
WATCHING WHAT SENATOR GRAHAM 
HAD TO SAY AND HIS REACTION I 
THINK IT IS A WAY OF THINKING 
ABOUT HOW SHE DID CONDUCT THESE 
QUESTIONS.  
SHE DID RAISE AND POINT TO SOME 
REAL HOLES IN THE TESTIMONY 
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.  
SHE RAISED INCONSISTENCIES 
ABOUT A SPECIFIC YEAR IT 
STARTED OUT BEING SOMETIME IN 
THE 80s AND THEN IT WAS THE 
EARLY 80s.  
AND THEN IT BECAME MAYBE 1982 
OR 1983.  
NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN IT IS 1982. 
>> THEY SAY THAT IS COMMON WITH 
TRAUMA VICTIMS. 
>>  THIS DARTED OUT, STARTING 
OUT FROM HER TESTIMONY TODAY 
BUT THEN GOING BACK TO EVEN 
WHAT SHE TOLD WASHINGTON POST.  
THAT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.  
THEY WERE ABLE TO POINT TO SOME 
INCONSISTENCIES IN HER STORY 
THAT SHE HAS EVEN TOLD RECENTLY.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE AT THE 
PARTY? 
THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED 
THIS AND THEN SHE SAID THIS TO 
THE THERAPIST AND IS NOW.  
AL OF THAT, ALL OF THOSE 
INCONSISTENCIES THAT MAY NOT 
ADD UP TO MUCH AND THERE IS NO 
REAL AHA MOMENT, BUT ALL OF 
THAT THEN ALLOWS WHAT WE SAW 
AND THE REACTION FROM WHAT 
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE FROM 
REPUBLICANS, WHICH IS THE FACTS
.  AFTER THIS HEARING THERE IS 
STILL NO CORROBORATION.  
THERE IS STILL NO 
CONTEMPORANEOUS EVIDENCE.  
IT IS STILL CREDIBILITY AS 
NWORA HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT 
IS HE SAID, SHE SAID.  
THIS IS A QUESTION OF 
CREDIBILITY.  
PEOPLE BELIEVE SHE CAME ACROSS 
AS CREDIBLE BUT NOW IT'S ALL ON 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
>>  SO THERE'S ROOM ON BOTH 
SIDES TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT 
WE SUPPORT THIS PERSON OR THIS 
PERSON THIS IS WHY WE ARE 
VOTING. 
>>  WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE TO 
MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION WHO 
ARE ON THE FENCE THEY HAVE TO 
DECIDE WAS DOCTOR FORD CREDIBLE 
ENOUGH NOT TO ELEVATE KAVANAUGH?
IT IS THE QUESTION WHETHER OR 
WHETHER OR NOT SHE WAS 
CREDIBLE.  
WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HER THAT WAS 
NOT CREDIBLE? 
THAT HAS TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST 
WHAT WAS WITNESSED TODAY, WHICH 
EVEN REPUBLICAN SENATORS WERE 
SAYING SHE SEEMED CREDIBLE.  
I WAS STRUCK THAT SENATOR 
CORNYN SAID THAT THE GAPS PROOF 
OF THE TRAUMA.  
IN OTHER WORDS, SAYING HE SAW 
SOME GAPS IN HER STORY BUT THEN 
HE QUICKLY SAID AFTER THAT IT 
IS PROOF OF THE TRAUMA, AS IF TO
, IT WASN'T HIS INTENT, BUT TO 
UNDERSCORE -- 
>> I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE 
WATCHING THAT SANCTION WAS 
EVASIVE IN ANY WAY.  
SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS THAT 
WERE ASKED.  
AS WE MOVE TO THE AFTERNOON THE 
QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GOING 
TO HEAR FROM BRETT KAVANAUGH? 
>> RIGHT.  
I THINK BECAUSE NOW WE REALLY 
HAVE NO NEW INFORMATION, NO NEW 
FACTS.  WE SAW SOME 
INCONSISTENCIES.  NOW THE 
PRESSURE IS ON KAVANAUGH TO 
COME ACROSS AS CREDIBLE AND 
BELIEVABLE AND ANSWER THESE 
QUESTIONS AS OPENLY AND 
HONESTLY AND FORTHRIGHTLY AS HE 
CAN.  
YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HIM PRESENT
A DEFENSE THAT THIS WAS NOT ME. 
I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A 
PRETTY IMPASSIONED ONE.  
THIS IS NOT ABOUT JUST THE 
SUPREME COURT AND A SEAT ON THE 
SUPREME COURT FOR LIFE, THIS IS 
ABOUT HIS LIFE AND A REPUTATION 
THAT HE HAS BUILT.  YOU'RE 
GOING TO SEE HIM MAKE THAT 
OPENING STATEMENT.  
AND THEN IT'S THE QUESTIONS.  
>> OTHER INCONSISTENCIES AND 
NOT TO DOUBT HER STORY? 
>> WHAT WE WILL SEE FROM 
KAVANAUGH, YOU WILL SEE THE 
DEMOCRATS TRY TO IMPUGN THAT 
CHARACTER AND HIS NAME AND 
INTEGRITY THAT HE WAS A THIS IS 
AT ODDS WITH THE WAY I HAVE 
LIVED MY WHOLE LIFE.  
IT WILL BE HIS LIFE OPEN FOR 
EXAMINATION THIS AFTERNOON.  
>> NWORA IS STANDING BY. 
>>  HOW COMBATIVE DO YOU THINK 
IT WILL BE? 
>> I THINK IT COULD BE QUITE 
COMBATIVE.  
BASED ON THE TONE OF THE 
HEARING SO FAR AND THE WAY 
REPUBLICANS ARE INTERPRETING IT 
LIKE WE ARE TRYING TO BE FAIR, 
DEMOCRATS ARE PLAYING POLITICS. 
IF DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO LOOK 
LIKE THEY ARE PLAYING -- THEY 
ARE PLAYING POLITICS THAT COULD 
HELP KAVANAUGH AND REPUBLICANS 
TRYING TO MAKE THE ARGUMENT FOR 
HIM. 
>>  YOU CAN'T IMAGINE DEMOCRATS 
WANT TO MAKE THEIR STORY AFTER 
THE TESTIMONY FROM DOCTOR FORD 
WHO SEEMS THERE IS AGREEMENT 
SHE WAS A CREDIBLE WITNESS.  
IF THERE WERE PURELY POLITICAL 
MOTIVES THEY WOULD WANT HER TO 
BE THE FACE OF THIS, NOT 
THEMSELVES.  
HE MIGHT GET IN THEIR OWN WAY.  
HERE IS THE OTHER QUESTION.  
RACHEL MITCHELL HANDLED THE 
QUESTIONS FOR REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS FOR CHRISTINE BLASEY 
FORD.  
HOW DOES SHE THEN PLAY INTO THE 
KAVANAUGH QUESTIONS? 
>> THE KAVANAUGH -- KAVANAUGH 
GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS FOR ALL 
OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS.  
THERE IS A PART OF RACHEL 
MITCHELL THAT YOU COULD WATCH.  
WHEN SHE WOULD ATTEMPT TO BE 
FRIENDLY AND COMFORTING AND BE 
THERE WITH YOU AND ACT ALMOST 
AS IF SHE WERE THE ADVOCATE FOR 
DOCTOR FORD TO MAKE HER FEEL 
SECURE.  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 
SHE HAS TO DO WITH BRETT 
KAVANAUGH.  SHE HAS TO BE HIS 
PARTNER IN THIS.  BRETT 
KAVANAUGH HAS GOT TO SHOW HIS 
HUMANITY.  WE ARE USED TO 
LOOKING AT SOMEONE'S 
CONFIRMATION HEARING OF WHETHER 
OR NOT THEY HAVE THE FITNESS TO 
BE IN LIFE TENURED APPOINTMENT 
TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME 
COURT WHICH IS MAKING THE LAW, 
INTERPRETING THE LAW FOR THE 
ENTIRE COUNTRY, WHICH COULD, 
FOR HIM, BE 30 OR 40 YEARS.  
IS HE THAT? SHE HAS TO SHOW HIM 
TO BE FIT . THE IS A 
CONTRADICTION.  YOU HAVE TO BE 
FACTUAL AND YOU HAVE TO BE 
CALM.  
AT THE SAME TIME, YOUR LIFE AND 
YOUR FAMILIES LIFE HAS BEEN 
UPENDED AND WE NEED TO SEE YOUR 
PAIN.  
>> THE CHALLENGE FOR KAVANAUGH 
IS HE IS A LAWYER AND ONE OF 
THE SENATORS MADE THE POINT HE 
IS USED TO BEING IN THE SENATE, 
BUT HE'S NOT LIKE A TRIAL 
LAWYER OR THIS POLISHED GUY.  
IS NOT SOMEONE WHO GOES ON 
TELEVISION A LOT.  
HE HAS BEEN VERY MUCH, HE'S AN 
INTELLECTUAL.  
HE IS CLOISTERED AWAY IN THAT 
IVORY TOWER.  
HE IS A LAW PROFESSOR.  
THIS IS NOT A NATURAL FORM FOR 
HIM BY ANY MEANS. 
>>  BUT A MORE NATURAL FORUM FOR
HIM THAT HER. 
>>  NOT NECESSARILY. 
>>  SHE HAS GONE THROUGH SOME 
HEARINGS ARE READY. 
>>  BUT NOT NECESSARILY.  
>> HERE SO DEALING WITH THE 
FACT THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 
GOING TO HAVE TO FACE CROSS-
EXAMINATION FROM THE DEMOCRATS. 
HOW DO YOU THINK THEY SHOULD 
PLAY THIS? 
>> I THINK THEY NEED TO BE FIRM
.  I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO DO 
WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO, 
WHICH IS TO GO BACK, 
PARTICULARLY INTO THAT FOX NEWS 
INTERVIEW STATEMENTS THAT WAS 
SO ILL ADVISED.  
HE MADE BROAD STATEMENTS ABOUT 
THE TYPE OF LIFE THAT HE LED, 
WHICH THEN ALLOWED PEOPLE FROM 
YALE TO COME FORWARD AND SAY IT 
WASN'T LIKE THAT.  
>> NORAH O'DONNELL IS STILL 
STANDING HIGH ON THE HILL.  
>> Reporter: I HAVE BEEN 
TALKING TO OFFICIALS CLOSE TO 
KEVIN UPPER KEYS THE PERSON 
THAT WILL BE TESTIFYING NEXT 
WEEK I'M TOLD HE WILL COME BACK 
MUCH MORE FORCEFULLY THEN HE 
HAS IN THE PAST.  
CALLING THIS A GROTESQUE AND 
OBVIOUS CHARACTER ASSASSINATION
.  HE DID, I'M TOLD JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, DID WATCH MOST OF 
THIS TESTIMONY.  
COMPLETELY DENIES THAT HE WAS 
AT THAT HOUSE AND THAT HE 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED DOCTOR FORD. 
I THINK YOU GOT A SENSE FROM 
LISTENING TO SENATOR LINDSEY 
GRAHAM THAT REPUBLICANS ARE 
READY TO WAGE WAR.  
REALLY START A BURROW INTO SOME 
OF THOSE, BUT THEY BELIEVE, OUR 
CREDIBILITY GAPS.  
SOME PEOPLE DON'T THINK THOSE 
ARE CREDIBILITY GAPS.  
REPUBLICANS CLEARLY DO.  
THEY WILL BRING UP WHAT THEY 
BELIEVE ARE FIVE DIFFERENT 
ACCOUNTS OF HOW MANY DIFFERENT 
PEOPLE WERE AT THAT PARTY.  
AS ONE OFFICIAL SAID, THEY'RE 
GOING TO POKE HOLES INTO HER 
CREDIBILITY AT THE SAME TIME I 
HAVE ALSO SPOKEN WITH A WHITE 
HOUSE OFFICIAL WHO ADMITTED IT 
WAS VERY COMPELLING TEST JUST 
VERY COMPELLING TESTIMONY THAT 
SHE GAVE.  
UNTIL THE PRESIDENT DID WATCH 
MOST OF DOCTOR FORD'S 
TESTIMONY.  
NOT ALL OF IT BECAUSE HE WAS IN 
NEW YORK FOR THE UN MEETING.  
HE WAS TRAVELING BACK DOWN TO 
WASHINGTON, BUT DID WATCH SOME 
OF THAT TESTIMONY.  
I THINK JUST TO TO SET UP WHAT 
WE ARE ABOUT TO HEAR, TO BE 
INCREDIBLY COMPELLING AS YOU 
ALL WATCHED THIS MORNING ALONG 
WITH ME, DOCTOR FORD SAID SHE 
IS 100% SURE THAT IT WAS BRETT 
KAVANAUGH WHO SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED HER.  SPECIFICALLY, 
DESCRIBING THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL 
REASONS WHY SHE REMEMBERS THAT 
SO CLEARLY.  YOU ARE NOW, 
ACCORDING TO PEOPLE I HAVE 
SPOKEN WITH, JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS 
GOING TO CALL THIS CHARACTER 
ASSASSINATION ALONG WITH SOME 
OF THE OTHER ALLEGATIONS THAT 
HAVE BEEN MAJOR KEY BELIEVES HE 
IS NOT ONLY DEFENDING HIS 
CREDIBILITY, BUT ALSO HIS 
REPUTATION AND HIS CHARACTER, 
WHICH IS WHAT THIS HAS LARGELY 
BEEN ABOUT, BUT ABILITY AND 
CHARACTER.  
I THINK YOU'LL SEE LINDSEY 
GRAHAM AND SOME OF THE OTHER 
REPUBLICAN SENATORS PUSH BACK 
HARD.  
THE TWO PEOPLE TO WATCH FOR ON 
THE REPUBLICAN SIDE ARE SENATOR 
BEEN SASS, A REPUBLICAN FROM 
NEBRASKA, WHO, ACCORDING TO 
REPORTS INSIDE THE ROOM, WAS 
ONE OF THE FEW REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS WHO SPECIFICALLY WENT 
OVER TO DOCTOR FORD AND SHOOK 
HER HAND AND SAID THANK YOU FOR 
BEING HERE.  
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED HER IN 
PERSON.  
HE HAS BEEN CRITICAL OF 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON A NUMBER OF 
ISSUES BUT I WOULD WATCH HIM 
VERY, VERY CLOSELY WITH THE 
OTHER PERSON TO WATCH IS 
SENATOR FLAKE WHO IS RETIRING 
PUP JUST REPUBLICAN FROM 
ARIZONA WHO HAS SAID IT IS VERY 
IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM HER.  
WATCHES QUESTIONING AS WELL 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
THESE ARE REALLY QUESTIONS 
ABOUT CARE.  IN PARTICULAR THE 
DEMOCRATS WILL BE VERY, VERY 
TOUGH ON JUDGE KAVANAUGH I 
THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE A LOT 
OF FIGHTING BACK AND FORTH.  
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY PARTISAN 
COMMITTEE AS FAR AS I'M TOLD 
THE BOAT IN THIS COMMITTEE IS 
STILL GOING FORWARD TOMORROW 
MORNING NO MATTER WHAT IT'S 
LIKE THAT'S GOING TO BE 
INTERESTING. 
>>  FOR SURE.  
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.  I'M 
CURIOUS, IN 1991 WHEN CLARENCE 
THOMAS TESTIFIED AT ANITA HILL 
DID AS WELL, HOW DID HE PREPARE 
FOR THAT AND HOW DID HE 
ESTABLISH THE KIND OF TONE THAT 
HE WANTED TO SET? 
>> HE SAT DOWN AT HIS KITCHEN 
TABLE WITH A NOTE BOOK ABOUT 
LIKE THIS AND WROTE IT ALL OUT 
BY HAND.  
HE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN AN 
INTERVIEW ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO, 
IT IS STILL VERY RAW.  
HE SAID HE COULDN'T SLEEP.  
HE COULDN'T DECIDE HOW TO SAY 
IT AND CRAFT HIS STATEMENT.  
HE GOT UP EARLY IN THE MORNING 
AND SAT AT THE KITCHEN TABLE 
AND THE WORDS JUST CAME OUT.  
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GO BACK 
AND LOOK AT THAT TESTIMONY.  
IT IS WHITE-HOT TESTIMONY.  
IT IS LIKE FIRE.  
HE DID NOT DO THIS.  
THIS IS A TRAVESTY.  
HIS WHOLE LIFE, HIS REPUTATION, 
EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD WORKED 
TO BUILD HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY 
FROM HIM BY THE SENATORS.  
HE TALKED ABOUT IN THE 
INTERVIEW HOW HE REALLY FELT IT 
WAS AN ISSUE OF RACE.  
I THINK THAT'S A BIG 
DISTINCTION HERE.  
WHEN SOME OF THE SENATORS WERE 
QUESTIONING HIM HE FELT LIKE HE 
WAS LIKE A PLANTATION OWNER 
TALKING DOWN TO HIM LIKE HE 
EVEN USED THE TERM LYNCHING AT 
THAT TIME.  
>> THAT'S A VERY VOLATILE WORD. 
I'M CURIOUS, IS THIS THE 
ULTIMATE HE SAID SHE SAID? 
SHE SAID HE'S 100% SURE IS THAT 
HIM.  
HE SAYS NOT ONLY WAS IT NOT ME, 
I WASN'T EVEN THERE. 
>>  YES.  
IT IS A HE SAID, SHE SAID. 
>>  HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHO IS 
TELLING THE TRUTH? 
>> HOW DO WE DO IT IN A COURT 
OF LAW? 
HERE IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THIS 
IS NOT A COURT OF LAW.  
WE ARE ONLY LOOKING, 
ULTIMATELY, FOR THE FINAL VOTE 
OF A FEW SENATORS.  
WE BELIEVE THAT THE SENATORS, 
NO MATTER WHAT, ARE GOING TO 
VOTE ALONG PARTY LINES WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF A FEW.  
THOUGH, I COULD BE SURPRISED, I 
SUPPOSE.  
WHENEVER THERE ARE WITNESSES AT 
TRIAL WHO BOTH SEEM TO HAVE AN 
AURA OF CREDIBILITY AND YOU 
HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE YOU HAVE 
TO DECIDE WHAT IT IS THAT MAKES 
YOU THINK THAT THIS ONE IS 
TELLING THE TRUTH.  IN DOCTOR 
FORD'S TESTIMONY WHAT WE DO KNOW
IS THAT IN ADDITION TO PASSING 
A POLYGRAPH AND, YES, I KNOW 
SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL IT JUNK 
SCIENCE, BUT I WILL TELL YOU, 
IN MY OWN PRACTICE WHEN I USED 
TO HAVE DEFENDANTS WHO HAD BEEN 
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND I 
WOULD ASK THEM IF THEY WOULD 
TAKE A CONFIDENTIAL POLYGRAPH 
FOR ME AND NOT TO WORRY THAT 
THEY ARE MOSTLY INCONCLUSIVE 
AND NOT TO FEAR ANYTHING ABOUT 
IT, IF THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY 
WOULDN'T THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO 
HEAR.  
I WOULD IT REPRESENT THOSE 
PEOPLE.  
PUBLICLY ABOUT 80% OF THEM SAID 
THEY WOULD TAKE IT . THE 
POLYGRAPH DOES HAVE VALUE TO ME 
AND TO OTHER PEOPLE.  
IN ADDITION, SHE HAS TOLD OTHER 
PEOPLE ABOUT BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
ALTHOUGH, SHE HAS TOLD THEM IN 
MORE RECENT TIMES BUT THE FACT 
THAT SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER 
CERTAIN THINGS AND THAT IT DOES 
CHANGE A BIT HERE AND THERE 
ASKED HER NUMBERS AND PLACES, 
ULTIMATELY, THOSE KIND OF 
INCONVENIENT TRUTHS MAKE HER 
MORE CREDIBLE TO MANY PEOPLE. 
>>  THIS FEELS DIFFERENT TO ME. 
IN MANY CASES THEY WILL SAY HE 
SAID, SHE SAID CONSENSUAL OR 
NOT CONSENSUAL.  
THIS IS A CASE WHERE HE IS A 
NOT ONLY DID I NOT DO IT, BUT 
IT WASN'T EVEN THERE. 
>>  RIGHT.  
>> YOU HAVE SUCH A STARK DIVIDE 
HERE.  
HE HAS GIVEN HIMSELF A LOT OF 
ROOM IN TERMS OF THE INITIAL 
DENIALS OF WHAT HAPPENED OR 
DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
>>  HE'S NOT CALLING HER A 
LIAR, HE'S SAYING THAT SHE HAS 
SOMEHOW BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
BY SOMEONE, OR AT LEAST THAT IS 
WHAT HE HAS SET ON FOX NEWS, 
AND THAT SHE HAS UNDERGONE A 
TRAUMA, BUT IT WAS NOT HIM. 
>>  AS YOU MENTIONED BEFORE, 
RACHEL MITCHELL DIDN'T GET INTO 
DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED 
INSIDE THAT BEDROOM BECAUSE OF 
WHAT HE SAID BEFORE AND WHAT 
SHE ANTICIPATES.  I THINK HE 
WILL SAY THIS AFTERNOON AS WE 
MOVE THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON -- 
WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST QUESTIONS 
YOU HAVE ABOUT THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS? 
>> HOW THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING 
TO, FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL HEAR 
FROM KAVANAUGH FIRST SO HIS 
STATEMENT.  HIS DEMEANOR.  
CERTAINLY, I WOULD NOT EXPECT 
HIM FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT 
WATCHED HIS INTERVIEW ON FOX 
NEWS, WHERE HE SEEMED, HE WAS 
TWO MEASURED -- TO MEASURED.  
HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY INDIGNATION 
OR ANGER.  
HE HAS BEEN ACCUSED NONE OF 
THIS CAME UP YET, BUT SOME OF 
THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN 
PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY.  INCLUDING
GANG RAPE AND BEING AT PARTIES 
WHERE MULTIPLE YOUNG HIGH 
SCHOOL GIRLS WERE BEING RAPED 
OVER WEEKENDS IN BETHESDA.  
ON ITS FACE YOU WOULD THINK 
SOMEBODY ACCUSED OF THAT WAS A 
ARE YOU KIDDING ME? 
SERIOUSLY? 
WE DIDN'T SEE THAT IN THAT FOX 
NEWS INTERVIEW.  
I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE SOME OF 
THAT ANGER IN HIS OPENING 
STATEMENT.  
I WILL ALSO BE VERY CURIOUS TO 
SEE HOW THE DEMOCRATS GO AFTER 
HIM ON HIS PERSONAL BEHAVIOR 
AND IF THESE OUTSIDE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE RAISED.  
THEY WANT THIS TO BE, THEY 
DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS, THIS IS ALL ABOUT 
FORD WHO THEY BELIEVE, BASED ON 
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING, DID 
VERY WELL.  
KEEP THE FOCUS ON HER. 
>>  THE POLITICAL QUESTION WILL 
BE WHO SETS THE TERMS OF THE 
DEBATE AFTER THIS IS OVER? 
DOES IT BECOME DO YOU BELIEVE 
DOCTOR FORD? 
IF THAT'S THE CASE THAT'S NOT 
GREAT FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH.  
IF IT BECOMES DO YOU BELIEVE 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HE GIVES 
THE KIND OF STRONG DEFENSIVE 
HIMSELF, WHAT HE NEEDS TO 
PROVIDE IS A COMPELLING DEFENSE 
OF A SENATORS VOTE.  
THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO SAY I 
ELEVATED HIM BECAUSE OF X IF 
THEY CAN SAY BECAUSE I FOUND 
HIM CREDIBLE THAT HELPS THOSE 
REPUBLICANS WHO ARE GOING TO 
NEED TO VOTE. 
>>  DOES IT EVER BECOME I 
BELIEVE THEM BOTH? 
>> YOU COULD LEAVE BOTH.  
IN AN ODD WAY.  
YOU COULD BELIEVE THAT SHE 
BELIEVES SHE IS TELLING THE 
TRUTH SHE FIRMLY BELIEVES SHE 
IS TELLING THE TRUTH.  
>> WHICH IS WHY SHE COULD PASS 
A LIE DETECTOR. 
>>  AND THAT HE FIRMLY BELIEVES 
HE IS TELLING THE TRUTH.  
THEM THAT LEADS YOU DOWN 
ANOTHER PATH, WHICH IS WHAT WAS 
HIS BEHAVIOR LIKE AT THIS TIME 
IN HIS LIFE WITH OTHER PEOPLE? 
WAS THIS SIMPLY A NIGHT HE 
DOESN'T REMEMBER? 
THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HELP 
HIM.  SUCK WE ARE EXPECTING TO 
SEE THE JUDGE KAVANAUGH IN THE 
NEXT TWO OR THREE MINUTES.  
BEFORE WE GO BACK THERE AND GO 
TO THE CAMERA THAT IS GOING TO 
SHOW HIM I WANT TO GO TO ED 
O
HE HAS MORE INFORMATION FROM 
JUST OUTSIDE THAT HEARING ROOM. 
>> Reporter: YES.  
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN 
DISCUSSING PROSECUTOR MITCHELL 
AND HER ROLE IN ALL OF THIS IT 
IS GOING TO CHANGE SLIGHTLY 
ONCE JUDGE KAVANAUGH ENTERS THE 
ROOM I AM TOLD.  
SHE IS GOING TO ASK ABOUT 20 
MINUTES WORTH OF QUESTIONS AT 
THE BEGINNING.  
WE WILL EVENTUALLY HEAR FROM AT 
LEAST SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN 
MEMBERS OF THE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE WHEN THEY ARE CALLED 
UPON TO QUESTION THE JUDGE.  
THERE HAS ALSO BEEN SOME 
QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT WHETHER 
THIS WAS WORTH IT.  
WHY DOES WAS SHE AN EFFECTIVE 
INQUISITOR? 
I CHECKED WITH SOME SENIOR 
AIDES WHO WORK FOR REPUBLICANS 
AND IN THE WORDS OF ONE OF 
THEM, WHAT WAS THE ALTERNATIVE? 
REMEMBER THE OPTICS OF 11 MEN 
QUIZZING THIS WOMAN WAS SUCH 
THAT THEY WERE SO CONCERNED 
THEY WENT OUT AND FOUND RACHEL 
MITCHELL TO COME TO THIS.  THEY 
SAY ULTIMATELY SHE WAS TRYING 
TO ESTABLISH A FACT PATTERN AND 
SHE DID THAT TO THE BEST OF HER 
ABILITY.  
BEHIND US HERE JUST DOWN THE 
HALL IS WHERE JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
IS ACTUALLY CURRENTLY WAITING.  
HE WILL WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY 
HERE BACK INTO DO -- BACK INTO 
THE HEARING ROOM TO SIT DOWN 
AND BEGIN HIS TESTIMONY.  
HERE IN DIRKSEN THIS AFTERNOON 
IT HAS REALLY JUST BEEN COPS 
AND REPORTERS.  
THEY'RE NOT REALLY ALLOWING ANY 
OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC NEAR THIS 
HEARING ROOM.  
THAT IS MOSTLY IN DEFERENCE TO 
DOCTOR FORD AND HOPE THAT THIS 
WOULD BE A SOMEWHAT MORE 
DISCREET AND RESPECTFUL EXCHANGE
.  AS JAN AND OTHERS HAVE 
POINTED OUT, WE SHOULD EXPECT ú 
PRETTY QUICKLY.  
I SUSPECT BY THE TIME WE GET TO 
SENATOR DICK DURBIN OF 
ILLINOIS, WHO IS A MORE SENIOR 
MEMBER OF THE SENATE BUT A 
PARTISAN WARRIOR NONETHELESS IN 
THE SECOND RANKING DEMOCRAT THAT
IT IS AT THAT POINT THE 
DEMOCRATS REALLY BEGIN TO DIG 
INTO KAVANAUGH, HIS PERSONAL 
LIFE, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY OF 
THAT SPEAKS TO HIS CREDIBILITY. 
WE ASKED SOME OF THE MORE 
JUNIOR DEMOCRATS EARLIER ARE 
YOU GOING TO DO THAT AND WHY 
WOULD YOU GO INTO HIS SEX LIFE 
BRING UP HIS DRINKING? 
THEY SAID IT ALL SPEAKS TO HIS 
CREDIBILITY, WHICH IS NOW IN 
QUESTION AS THIS EXCHANGE 
CONTINUES. 
>>  THAT QUESTIONING WILL BE 
VERY INTERESTING.  
IT WILL ALSO BE INTERESTING TO 
WATCH SOME REPUBLICAN 
QUESTIONING.  
TO WHAT EXTENT JOHN, JEFF 
FLAKE, AND BEN SASSE 
POTENTIALLY SPEAK.  
THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMITTEE THERE.  
POTENTIAL SWING VOTES ON ALL OF 
THIS. 
>>  THAT'S RIGHT.  WHAT WE THEN 
LEARNED FROM THE QUESTIONS THAT 
THE ASK.  
IN THE QUESTIONS THEY ASKED 
THEY WILL LAY THE PREDICATE FOR 
THE FINAL DECISION ON THIS 
NOMINATION.  
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SAY I 
ASKED THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I 
SOUGHT AN ANSWER TO THIS THING. 
I GOT THE ANSWER I WANTED AND 
THAT LED ME TO THIS VOTE.  
AS POLITICIANS THIS IS A MOMENT 
TO BEGIN A NARRATIVE TO EXPLAIN 
THEIR VOTE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
IF THEY GET A CHANCE TO QUESTION
, THAT'S WHY THERE COULD HAVE 
BEEN SOME BENEFIT TO HAVING 
REPUBLICANS ASK THE QUESTIONS.  
IN ASKING THE QUESTION YOU CAN 
FRAME THE SHAPE OF THE DEBATE.  
THIS IS A POLITICAL DEBATE, NOT 
A COURTROOM.  
THE ABILITY TO FRAME AND SHAPE 
THE QUESTION CAN SOMETIMES 
DETERMINE WHAT THE POLITICS END 
UP BEING IN THE END EXCEPT WE 
ARE NOT INSIDE THE COURTROOM OR 
A GOVERNMENT BUILDING, WE ARE 
INSIDE THE COURT OF OPINION 
HERE. 
>>  IN CERTAIN WAYS I 
UNDERSTAND THE OPTICS WERE 
TERRIBLE TO HAVE 11 WHITE MEN 
GOING AFTER DOCTOR FORD, BUT AT 
THE SAME TIME, THERE WAS AN 
ABILITY ALSO, IF THEY HAD, TO 
B ABLE TO HAVE TREATED HER 
WITH DIGNITY IN A WAY THAT 
SENATOR GRASSLEY DID IN HIS 
OPENING STATEMENT BUT THEY 
MIGHT HAVE FARED AT HER FOR 
THAT. 
>>  YOU SAID IN THE BEGINNING, 
RICKY, IT WAS VERY HARD FOR 
RACHEL MITCHELL TO GET A REAL 
DIALOGUE GOING.  
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS EFFECTIVE 
DESPITE THE HANDICAP THAT SHE 
HAD? 
>> I DON'T THINK SHE WAS 
EFFECTIVE.  
I ALSO DON'T THINK IT'S 
NECESSARILY HER FAULT EXPECT 
THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IF 
ANYONE COULD HAVE BEEN 
EFFECTIVE UNDER THOSE TERMS? 
>> RIGHT.  
THE THING THAT HELPS BRETT -- 
BRETT KAVANAUGH IS IF HE WILL 
COME IN AND REPUBLICAN SENATORS 
CAN SAY I FOUND HIM CREDIBLE. 
>>  I CANNOT.  
I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE'S A 
REPUBLICAN ON THAT COMMITTEE 
THAT IS THINKING, DANG IT, I 
WISH I HAD MY CHANCE TO SIT 
DOWN AND ASK HER ALL OF THESE 
QUESTIONS I COULD HAVE REALLY 
PUT HER ON THE FIRE.  
NO ONE BUT THAT WAS FRAUGHT 
WITH PERIL. 
>>  IT WAS. 
>>  IN THIS CLIMATE WHAT THEY 
WERE ABLE TO DO IN 1991 WHEN 
ARLAND SPECTOR WAS REALLY 
GIVING IT TO ANITA HILL IS NOT 
WHAT THEY ARE DOING IN 2018.  
THIS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A GREAT 
MORNING FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, 
THERE WASN'T KIND ACROSS PEOPLE 
HOPED FOR, BUT FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS I WOULD BE STUNNED 
IF ANY OF THEM THOUGHT I WISH I 
COULD HAVE DONE THAT, I COULD 
HAVE REALLY PUT IT TO HER. 
>>  THEY COULD HAVE ALSO HAD 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW SOME 
GRACE AND COMPASSION AND STILL 
MAKE THEIR POINT.  
>> BUT THEY HAVE THE 
CONSTITUENTS YOU ARE SAYING -- 
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO 
BELIEVE HIM AND THINK HE HAS 
BEN UNFAIRLY ACCUSED.  
HE IS THIS WONDERFUL MAN LOOK 
WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING TO 
HIM.  
THOSE ARE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. 
>>  THAT'S A GREAT POINT.  
GOES CONSTITUENTS WOULD SAY WHY 
DIDN'T YOU REALLY GO AFTER? 
>> YOU MESSED UP.  
IT'S YOUR FAULT YOU DIDN'T 
DEFEND THIS FINE MAN ENOUGH.  
>> YOU ALSO HAVE NOW THE 
ABILITY OF WHICHEVER 
REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO USE 
THEIR OWN TIME IN ADDITION TO 
DEALING WITH FLAKE AND SASS, 
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO 
EXACTLY WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 
JUST DONE WITH DOCTOR FORD, 
WHICH IS TO BUILD UP THE PERSON 
THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH IS AND HIS 
CREDIBILITY.  WHICH WAS 
SOMETHING THAT THE DEMOCRATS 
DID VERY WELL WITH DOCTOR FORD. 
>>  WE ARE EXPECTING THIS 
AFTERNOON A DRAMATICALLY 
DIFFERENT TONE FROM WHAT WE SAW 
THIS MORNING.  
THAT IS BASICALLY THE TALE OF 
TWO DAYS.  PRESUMABLY, THIS 
AFTERNOON.  AS WE WAIT FOR úBRE 
THE SENATE HEARING ROOM WE WILL 
GET AN OPENING STATEMENT FOR 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AS WELL.  úHE H 
GOING TO SAY ALREADY, AS DID 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.  
WE WILL HAVE THE SAME 
QUESTIONING, IF NOT THE SAME 
TONE, THE SAME TIME ZIPPER 
QUESTIONING FROM DEMOCRATIC 
SENATORS AND REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS ON THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THAT IS 
FIVE MINUTES APIECE.  
HOWEVER, MUCH REPUBLICANS THEN 
YIELD THEIR TIME TO THE 
PROSECUTOR, RACHEL MITCHELL, 
THE GUIDANCE FROM ED O
WHO IS JUST OUTSIDE THE HEARING 
ROOM IS THAT THEY WILL GIVE 
RACHEL MITCHELL ABOUT 20 
MINUTES TO QUESTION.  IS THAT 
THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT 
IT? 
RACHEL MITCHELL WILL BE 
QUESTIONING BRETT KAVANAUGH? 
>> YES.  
SHE IS GOING TO QUESTION HIM.  
BACK TO THIS CRAZY FIVE 
MINUTES, FIVE MINUTES, FIVE 
MINUTES.  AT LEAST I ASSUME YOU 
ARE.  
>> WHICH IS NOT INTERROGATING 
EXPECT IT GOES EVERY OTHER ONE. 
>> NO.  
SHE IS NOT INTERROGATING, SHE'S 
PROPPING HIM UP. 
>>  SHE COULD, DEPENDING ON HER 
ROLE, SHE COULD IN AN ODD WAY 
PLAY THE ROLE THAT DEMOCRATS 
WERE PLAYING THIS MORNING.  
WHEN THERE'S AGGRESSIVE 
QUESTIONING OR GENTLE 
QUESTIONING THE DEMOCRATS WERE 
ABLE TO STEP IN AND 
REHABILITATE OR ADD CHARACTER 
WITNESSES.  
SHE COULD PLAY THAT ROLE. 
>>  POSSIBLE.  
IT IS THE WHOLE QUESTION OF 
TIMING.  
IT IS JUST LIKE IN A COURT OF 
LAW WHEN SOMEBODY, WHEN I'M ON 
A ROLL AND SOMEBODY INTERRUPTS 
ME WITH AN OBJECTION IT WITH 
ROMY.  
AT LEAST I COULDN'T GET BACK SO 
QUICKLY ON THAT ROLE.  
HERE SHE MAY BE IN A POSITION, 
RACHEL MITCHELL, TO BE ABLE TO 
INTERRUPT THE DEMOCRATS FLOW IF 
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ANY 
CONTINUITY, IF THEY HAVE 
THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING 
TO BUILD UPON EACH OTHER.  THAT 
MAY NOT.  
THEY MAY BE ALL IN THEIR LITTLE 
WORLD. 
>>  ALSO GIVE HIM A WAY TO PLAY 
CLEANUP.  
SHE COULD SAY DON'T YOU MEAN 
THIS? 
YOU HAVE A WITNESS THAT SAID 
THAT.  
WHATEVER PRESSURE POINTS THERE 
ARE -- 
>> SHE IS EXPERIENCED AT THAT.  
PROSECUTORS DO A LOT OF REDIRECT
EXAMINATION. 
>>  IT WOULD SEEM THE 
DEMOCRATIC GAME PLAN WAS EASY 
TO IDENTIFY THEY PRAISED FORD 
FOR BEING HEROIC AND THEY MADE 
A LOT OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION 
NOT TAKEN PLACE IN AN EFFORT TO 
SAY YOU MAY FIND GAPS IN HER 
STORY, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN 
SOLVED BY AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
EACH STATE ON THOSE TWO POINTS 
THROUGHOUT THEIR FIVE MINUTE A 
LOT OF TIME.  
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
WHAT REPUBLICANS, WHEN WE ARE 
ALL THROUGH THE REPUBLICAN 
QUESTIONING OF JUDGE CABINET, 
WHAT TWO THINGS WE COULD COME 
DOWN TO.  
IT IS BASICALLY YOU HAVE ABOUT 
TWOPOINT YOU CAN MAKE.  
IN THE POLITICAL DEBATE THAT IS 
GOING TO TAKE PLACE AROUND THIS 
AND WHAT WILL THAT BE FOR 
REPUBLICANS? 
>> IS THERE ANY DOUBT IN YOUR 
MIND THAT THE WHAT WILL HAPPEN 
TOMORROW? 
>> HE CLEARLY IGNORED THE 
QUESTION. 
>>  LINDSEY GRAHAM YOU ARE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
>>  YES. 
>>  COULD THEY STILL BE ON 
TRACK TO VOTE TOMORROW? 
>> THEY HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING 
OTHERWISE.
.  WE ARE JUST LEARNING THAT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S FAMILY IS IN 
THE HEARING ROOM NOW.  
WE'RE WAITING FOR HIM TO ARRIVE 
IN THE SECOND DRAMATIC PART OF 
THIS HISTORIC DAY ON CAPITOL 
HILL.  AS WE HAVE ALREADY HEARD 
FROM CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, 
BRETT KAVANAUGH'S ACCUSER, NOW 
WE WAIT TO HEAR FROM KAVANAUGH 
HIMSELF.  
RICKY, IF YOU ARE A SENATOR ON 
EITHER SIDE, IF YOU ARE ONE OF 
THESE REPUBLICAN SENATORS FIRST,
WHO WANTS TO ASK A QUESTION AND 
NOT YIELD THAT TIME TO RACHEL 
MITCHELL WHAT ARE YOU ASKING? 
>> I THINK YOU ARE ASKING 
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS CHARACTER.  
YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT HE HAS 
LIVED HIS LIFE.  OR, YOU ARE 
ASKING HIM ABOUT THE TRAUMA 
THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY HAVE 
BEEN PUT THROUGH AND WHAT HAS 
HAPPENED TO HIS REPUTATION, 
WHICH FOR ALL INTENTS AND 
PURPOSES, SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN 
VERY, VERY GOOD IN THE POWERFUL 
COURT ON WHICH HE SERVED.  
YOU WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OF 
THAT.  
DOCTOR FORD IS NOT THE ONLY ONE 
WHO SUFFERED.  
THE KAVANAUGH'S ARE SUFFERING. 
>>  THIS REMINDS ME, THERE IS A 
MOMENT IN THE HEARING FOR 
JUSTICE SAM ALITO WHO IS 
REPLACING A KEY SWING VOTE AS 
WELL AND IT TURNED THE ENTIRE 
HEARING WHEN HE GOT FRIENDLY 
QUESTIONING FROM LINDSEY GRAHAM 
ABOUT HOW -- LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS 
AND YOU ARE NOT ABAD PERSON.  
YOU HAVE NEVER HAD ALLEGATIONS 
LIKE THIS AGAINST YOU.  
THE JUSTICES SAID NO.  
HIS WIFE STARTED CRYING AND RAN 
OUT OF THE ROOM.  
AT THAT MOMENT THE HEARING ROOM 
COMPLETELY CHANGED AND SAM 
ALITO WAS HEADED FOR THE 
SUPREME COURT PICK THAT WILL BE 
SOMETHING, THAT MOMENT -- BACK 
HAVING HIS FAMILY THERE I DO 
THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.  
I THINK THAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED 
TO HIM IN THE PUBLIC EYE HAS 
ALSO HAPPENED TO HIS FAMILY.  
I THINK THAT THE SENATORS, WE 
DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE CAMERA, 
BUT THE SENATORS WILL ALSO BE 
-- ALSO BE AWARE OF HOW THIS IS 
KAVANAUGH REACTS DURING THIS 
HEARING. 
>>  YOU MADE THIS POINT, THIS 
IS NO LONGER JUST A JOB 
INTERVIEW. 
>>  THAT'S RIGHT. 
>>  PUBLICANS WILL WANT TO 
REFRAME IT FROM BEING A JOB 
INTERVIEW TO GET A PROMOTION 
INTO IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IT WILL BE A 
PERMANENT VERDICT ON HIS 
CHARACTER, FOR HIS LIFE, AND 
FOR THE LIFE OF HIS FAMILY AND 
CHILDREN.  
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE 
CHOOSING TO DO -- RAISING THE 
EMOTIONAL STAKES FOR REPUBLICAN 
SENATORS. 
>>  THAT IS WHERE YOU'RE GOING 
TO HEAR WITH NO CORROBORATION, 
NO CONTEMPORANEOUS EVIDENCE, 
MULTIPLE INCONSISTENCIES, THIS 
IS ALL COOKED UP BY DEMOCRATS 
BECAUSE THEY SET ON THE 
ALLEGATION FOR TWO MONTHS.  
>> THEY SAID THEY SET ON THE 
ALLEGATION AT HER REQUEST.  
DOES THAT MATTER? 
>> WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO SAY 
AND WHAT WE ARE ALREADY 
STARTING TO HEAR IS THAT THEY 
COULD HAVE BROUGHT THIS 
FORWARD, EVEN HAD HER NAME 
REDACTED AND DONE IT 
ANONYMOUSLY SO IT DIDN'T EVEN 
HAVE TO BECOME PUBLIC.  
SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND 
REPRESENTATIVE AT NSU COULD 
HAVE COME FORWARD WITH THAT.  
THAT IS GOING TO BE PART OF 
THEIR NARRATIVE WE ALREADY SEE 
THEM COMING OUT TO SAY THIS.  
THAT DOCTOR FORD HAS MADE IT 
CLEAR THROUGHOUT THE MORNING 
SHE NEVER WANTED THIS TO BE A 
PUBLIC THING.  
SHE CAN BECAUSE THIS WAS HER 
CIVIC DUTY.  
>> SHE HOPED HE WOULD GET THE 
NOMINATION.  
SHE WANTED IT TO BE SOMEONE 
ELSE ENTIRELY.  
THAT'S WHY SHE 
A
LITTLE KID, WHEN YOU SEE
SOMETHING THAT'S NOT WORKING IN
YOUR TOWN, CALL YOUR LOCAL
CONGRESSMAN.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID.
>> AND THE TIPLINE.
>> THE ENCRYPTED TIP LINE WHERE
SHE REALLY COULD REMAIN WITH A
FEELING OF SAFETY OF
CONFIDENTIALITY.
I
. 
>>> I THINK BEAT KAVANAUGH IS 
IN A POSITION HERE. 
I'M WITH -- I DON'T KNOW IF I 
WERE HIM THAT I WOULD HAVE 
WATCHED ANY OF THAT. 
BECAUSE -- I THINK THAT IT 
WOULD EITHER ANGER ME IF I SAY 
I WASN'T THERE, I DIDN'T DO 
THIS, IT NEVER HAPPENED AND IT  
IS A SASS IS AN ASSASSINATION 
OF MY CHARACTER. 
>>  I STILL THINK YOU NEED TO 
KNOW WHAT THE OTHER PERSON IS 
SAYING. 
>>  WE KNEW IT. 
>>  I WOULD WANT TO HEAR IT. 
HE WILL LIKELY BE ASKED THAT. 
IF HE WAS WATCHING. 
>>  OF COURSE. 
IT'S A BETTER. 
>>  WHAT HIS REACTION WAS. 
>>  IT'S A BETTER ANSWER TO SAY 
HE WATCHED IT AND WHATEVER HIS 
REACTION MAY HAVE BEEN. 
IT'S A BETTER ANSWER THAN 
SAYING I WASN'T GOING TO DO IT. 
>>  THERE'S NO COMPROMISE. 
IS HE ELEVATED OR HE ISN'T. 
>>  RIGHT AND HE WILL HAVE THE 
TAG WITH HIM FOR THE REST OF 
HIS LIFE, ELEVATED OR NOT. 
>> AND THERE ARE NO WINNERS 
HERE. 
WHETHER HE IS ELEVATED OR NOT 
HE DOESN'T WIN. 
SHEDOESN'T WIN. 
THE SUPREME. 
>>  THE FAMILIES DON'T WIN. 
>>  THERE IS -- IT'S -- THIS 
ENTIRE PROCESS IS -- THERE ARE 
NO WINNERS. 
>>  WHAT COULD HAVE MADE IT A 
WINNING SITUATION? 
WOULD THE FBI INVESTIGATION IN 
THE BEGINNING HAVE MADE THIS 
SEEM LIKE A FAIR SITUATION TO 
PEOPLE WHO WERE CALLING FOR IT 
FROM THE BEGINNING? 
I SAID EARLIER SHE WANTED AN 
FBI INVESTIGATION AND PEOPLE 
THAT HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE 
AREN'T SAYING PLEASE COME 
INVESTIGATE ME. 
>>  THE THING. 
WHEN THE COMMITTEE WAS AWARE OF 
THE ALLEGATIONS, ONLY A COUPLE 
WEEKS AGO. 
THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION WHERE THEY 
INTERVIEWED THE WITNESSES. 
THE SENATE -- ALL OF THESE 
STATEMENTS THEY ARE TAKING WITH 
THEIR INVESTIGATORS IS IN THE 
SENATE. 
THAT'S THE FORUM FOR IT. 
THOSE ARE PUNISHABLE AS A 
FELONY IF YOU LIE SO IT'S NO 
DIFFERENT. 
WE ARE GOING TO DO IT IN THE 
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION PROCESS HAS ENDED 
AND THIS NEVER CAME UP BY THEN. 
I THINK. 
>>  SENATOR GRAHAM SAID WE 
COULD HAVE HAD AN INVESTIGATION 
IN THE LAST 11 DAYS. 
>>  THAT'S RIGHT. 
ABSOLUTELY. 
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. 
THEY COULD HAVE DONE IT IN THE 
HILL THOMAS. 
WHEN THEY REOPENED THAT. 
IT WAS A MATTER OF THREE DAYS 
THAT 2 TOOK THEM. 
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE ANSWERED 
ANYTHING IS MY POINT. 
THEY -- THE FBI JUST TAKES 
INTERVIEWS. 
>>  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION IN THE 
PUBLIC'S EYE. 
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. 
>>  MAYBE -- IT WOULD HAVE 
ROBBED A TALKING POINT THAT THE 
FBI -- POLITICALLY MAYBE IT WAS 
A BLUNDER BY REPUBLICAN IFS IT 
WOULD HAVE PROVIDE MORE 
INFORMATION. 
>>  AND PERHAPS THERE IS SOME 
CHANCE THEY MAY HAVE FOUND 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE -- 
THAT WOULD HAVE MADE IT 
CLEARER. 
>>  IT MAY HAVE CLEARED HIM. 
>>  INDEED AND SOME HAVE ARGUED 
THAT WOULD BE -- THAT HE -- 
THERE SHOULD BE AN 
INVESTIGATION FOR THE PURPOSES 
OF CLEARING HIM. 
I THINK IN YOUR QUESTION WHICH 
IS COULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER. 
IN THIS IS THAT THIS IS REALLY 
NOT THE BEST VENUE TO WORK WITH 
THE TRICKIEST QUESTIONS IN THE 
CULTURE THAT ARE IN ALL PARTS 
OF THE CULTURE. 
THIS IS NOT THE BEST PLACE TO 
UNWIND THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE 
WE HAVE YET TO FIND A BEST 
PLACE FOR THAT. 
>>  HOW MUCH WE HAVE LEARNED 
THAT WE DIDN'T IN 1991 AND NOW 
DOING IT ALL OVER AGAIN IN THE 
SAME WAY AND TO YOUR POINT THAT 
IT NOT BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE 
WAY TO DO IT BUT IT IS -- HOW 
IT'S HAPPENING. 
>>  YEAH. 
>>  RIGHT NOW. 
>>  WE SEE THE CHAIRMAN, 
REPUBLICAN CHAIRMAN. 
>>  THERE'S LINDSEY GRAHAM. 
>>  HE SAID HE FEELS AMBUSHED 
BY THE PROCESS. 
ORRIN HATCH YOU SEE THERE. 
SENATORS MAKING THEIR WAY BACK 
IN. 
THERE IS -- YOUR -- REPUBLICAN 
PICKED QUESTIONER RACHEL 
MITCHELL ON HER WAY BACK IN. 
JOHN KENNEDY TO THE ROOM. 
JOHN CORIN WHO WE HEARD. 
HIS WORDS WERE I WOULD SAY MORE 
MEASURED THAN LINDSEY GRAHAM'S 
WERE. 
GRAHAM HAD SOME VERY STRONG 
OPINIONS ABOUT WHAT IS TAKING 
PLACE SO FAR. 
YOU SEE TED CRUZ, BEN SASS, SO, 
ALL SENATORS, JEFF FLAKE. 
AGAIN -- YOU JUST SAW A FEW OF 
THE SENATORS WHO YOU WILL BE 
WATCHING VERY CLOSELY, NOT JUST 
THIS AFTERNOON BUT IN THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS AS WE FIGURE OUT 
WHETHER THIS FIRST VOTE -- WHAT 
HAPPENS THIS AFTERNOON, WHETHER 
A VOTE HAPPENS TOMORROW AND 
THEN WHETHER ONE TAKES PLACE 
AFTER THAT EARLY NEXT WEEK 
REGARDING BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
THE SUPREME COURT. 
THEY TOOK A BREAK NOW. 
THEY SAID IT WOULD BE A 45 
MINUTE BREAK BETWEEN WHEN FORD 
TESTIFIED AND WHEN BRETT 
KAVANAUGH TESTIFIED. 
ITS BEEN A LITTLE MORE THAN 
THAT 45 MINUTES. 
WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THE 
QUESTION OF IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
HAD BEEN WATCHING SOME OF THIS 
TESTIMONY. 
WE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 
THAT. 
WE KNOW THAT DURING PART OF HIS 
TIME HE WAS OBVIOUSLY MAKING 
HIS WAY FROM HIS HOME TO THE 
HEARING ITSELF. 
WE ARE ALSO TOLD THAT THE 
PRESIDENT HAS BEEN WATCHING 
THIS HEARING. 
HE ALSO WAS IN TRANSIT HEADING 
TO DC FROM NEW YORK WHERE HE 
WAS FOR THE UN MEETINGS. 
THE FOLKS INVOLVED IN THIS AS 
WELL AS THE REST OF THE COUNTRY 
ARE WATCHING EVERYTHING THAT 
HAS BEEN HAPPENING HERE SO 
CLOSELY TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE 
TO WATCH THIS AFTERNOON AS WE 
JUST DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN THIS 
AFTERNOON. 
>>  WE DON'T. 
I MEAN WE CAN ANTICIPATE AS 
MUCH AS WE CAN THAT YOU ARE 
GOING TO SEE TO SEE YOU A 
PASSION ATE BRETT KAVANAUGH AND 
AN IDIGNANT ONE.  
. 
>>  HE WAS HOLDING HIS WIFE'S 
HAND. 
>>  JUDGE KAVANAUGH WALKING IN 
TO HA HEARING ROOM HOLDING 
HANDS WITH HIS WIFE. 
A BLUE TIE AS HE MAKES HIS WAY 
TO THE HEARING TABLE. 
JUST HIS NAME IN FRONT OF HIM. 
FORD WAS FLANKED BY HER 
ATTORNEYS. 
I DON'T SEE OTHER SEATS THERE 
RIGHT NOW. 
IT'S JUST BRETT KAVANAUGH BY 
HIMSELF IN THAT CHAIR IT WOULD 
APPEAR RIGHT NOW AS HE PREPARES 
TO RECEIVE QUESTIONS IN FIVE 
MINUTE SLOTS FROM 11 SENATORS 
ON THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE AND TEN DEMOCRATS. 
AT THIS POINT A HEARING THAT 
WILL -- AS CHUCK, DIANE 
FEINSTEIN. 
A HEARING THAT WILL LIKELY TAKE 
US IN TO THE DINNER HOUR AT 
THIS POINT. 
LET'S LISTEN IN AS JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH SITS DOWN.  
. 
>>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH WE WELCOME 
YOU. 
ARE YOU READY? 
I HAVE A -- I HAVE SOMETHING I 
WANT TO CLEAR UP FROM THE LAST 
MEETING THAT DOESN'T AFFECT 
YOU. 
SO BEFORE I SWEAR YOU, I WOULD 
LIKE TO EXPLAIN MY RESPONSE TO 
SENATOR KENNEDY RIGHT AFTER THE 
BREAK. 
AT THAT TIME I ENTERED INTO THE 
RECORD THE STATEMENTS OF THREE 
WITNESSES, DR. FORD SAID WERE 
ALSO AT THE PARTY. 
THESE STATEMENTS WERE PROVIDED 
TO US UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY, 
IF YOU LIE TO CONGRESS. 
AS SOON AS MY TEAM LEARNED THE 
NAME OF THE THREE POTENTIAL 
WITNESSES WE IMMEDIATELY 
REACHED OUT TO THEM REQUESTING 
AN INTERVIEW. 
IN RESPONSE ALL THREE SUBMITTED 
STATEMENTS TO US DENYING ANY 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE GATHERING DR. 
FORD DESCRIBED. 
IF WE HAD CALLS WITH THEM WE 
WOULD HAVE INVITED THE MINORITY 
TO JOIN. 
EVERY TIME THAT WE HAVE 
RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION 
REGARDING JUDGE KAVANAUGH WE 
HAVE SOUGHT TO IMMEDIATELY 
FOLLOW THROUGH AND INVESTIGATE. 
THE MINORITY STAFF SAT ON DR. 
FORD'S LETTER FOR WEEKS AND 
STAFF TOLD US THAT THEY 
BELIEVED IT IS QUOTE HIGHLY 
INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE THESE 
FOLLOW UP CALLS BEFORE THE FBI 
FINISHES ITS INVESTIGATION, END 
OF QUOTE THOUGH THE FBI HAD 
COMPLETED ITS BACKGROUND 
INFORMATION. 
WHEN WE FOLLOWED UP WITH JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH AFTER WE RECEIVED DR. 
FORD'S ALLEGATIONS THE RANKING 
MEMBER STAFF DIDN'T JOIN US 
EVEN THOUGH THESE CALLS ARE 
USUALLY DONE ON A BIPARTISAN 
BASIS. 
THEY JOINED OTHER CALLS WITH 
THE JUDGE BUT DIDN'T 
PARTICIPATE OR ASK ANY 
QUESTIONS. 
WOULD YOU PLEASE RISE, SIR? 
>>  YES. 
>>  DO YOU AFFIRM THE TESTIMONY 
YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE BEFORE 
THE COMMITTEE WILL BE THE 
TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND 
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH SO HELP 
YOU GOD? 
>>  I DO. 
>>  YEAH. 
AND -- LIKE WE -- LIKE WE 
OFFERED TO SENATOR -- OR TO DR. 
FORD, YOU CAN TAKE WHATEVER 
TIME YOU WANT NOW FOR YOUR 
OPENING STATEMENT. 
THEN WE WILL GO TO QUESTIONS. 
PROCEED. 
>>  MR. CHAIRMAN, RANKING 
MEMBER FEINSTEIN, MEMBERS OF 
THE COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR 
ALLOWING ME TO MAKE MY 
STATEMENT. 
I WROTE IT MYSELF YESTERDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
NOBODY HAS SEEN A DRAFT OR IT 
EXCEPT FOR ONE OF MY FORMER LAW 
CLERKS. 
THIS IS MY STATEMENT. 
LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO DR. 
FORD PUBLICLY ACCUSED ME OF 
COMMITTING WRONGDOING AT AN 
EVENT MORE THAN 36 YEARS AGO 
WHEN WE WERE BOTH IN HIGH  
SCHOOL. 
I DENIED THE ALLEGATION 
IMMEDIATELY, CATEGO RICALLY. 
ALL FOUR PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY AT 
THE EVENT INCLUDING DR. FORD'S 
LONG TIME FRIEND MISS KAISER 
HAVE SAID THEY RECALL NO SUCH 
EVENT. 
HER LONG TIME FRIEND MISS 
KAISER SAID UNDER PENALTY OF 
FELONY SHE DOESN'T KNOW ME AND 
DOESN'T BELIEVE SHE EVER SAW ME 
AT A PARTY EVER. 
HERE IS THE QUOTE FROM HER 
ATTORNEY'S LETTER. 
QUOTE, SIMPLY PUT SHE DOESN'T 
KNOW MR. KAVANAUGH. 
SHE HAS NO RECOLLECTION OF EVER 
BEING AT A PARTY OR GATHERING 
WHERE HE WAS PRESENT WITH OR 
WITHOUT DR. FORD. 
END QUOTE. 
THINK ABOUT THAT FACT. 
THE DAY AFTER THE ALLEGATION 
APPEARED I TOLD THIS COMMITTEE 
THAT I WANTED A HEARING AS SOON 
AS POSSIBLE TO CLEAR MY NAME. 
I DEMANDED A HEARING FOR THE 
VERY NEXT DAY. 
UNFORTUNATELY, IT TOOK THE 
COMMITTEE TEN DAYS TO GET TO 
THIS HEARING. 
IN THOSE TEN LONG DAYS AS WAS 
PREDICTABLE AND AS I PREDICTED 
MY FAMILY AND MY NAME HAVE BEEN 
TOTALLY AND PERMANENTLY  
DESTROYED BY VICIOUS AND FALSE 
ADDITIONAL ACCUSATIONS. 
THE TEN DAY DELAY HAS BEEN 
HARMFUL TO ME AND MY FAMILY, TO 
THE SUPREME COURT, AND TO THE 
COUNTRY. 
WHEN THIS ALLEGATION FIRSTA 
ROSE I WELCOMED ANY KIND OF 
INVESTIGATION. 
SENATE, FBI, OR OTHERWISE. 
THE COMMITTEE NOW HAS CONDUCTED 
A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION AND I 
HAVE COOPERATED FULLY. 
I KNOW THAT ANY KIND OF 
INVESTIGATION, SENATE, FBI, 
MONTGOMERY POLICE, WHATEVER, 
WILL CLEAR ME. 
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE I KNOW. 
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
KNOWN ME MY WHOLE LIFE. 
LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE I HAVE 
GROWN UP WITH AND WORKED WITH 
AND PLAYED WITH AND COACHED 
WITH AND DATED AND TAUGHT AND 
GONE TO GAMES WITH AND HAD 
BEERS WITH. 
LISTEN TO THE WITNESSES WHO 
ALLEGEDLY WERE AT THIS EVENT 36 
YEARS AGO. 
LISTEN TO MISS KAISER. 
SHE DOES NOT KNOW ME. 
I WAS NOT AT THE PART DESCRIBED 
BY DR. FORD THIS PROCESS HAS 
BECOME A NATIONAL DISGRACE. 
THE CONSTITUTION GIVES THE 
SENATE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE 
CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 
YOU HAVE REPLACED ADVICE AND 
CONSENT WITH SEARCH AND 
DESTROY. 
SINCE MY NOMINATION IN JULY 
THERE HAS BEEN A FRENZY ON THE 
LEFT TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING, 
ANYTHING TO BLOCK MY 
CONFIRMATION. 
SHORTLY AFTER I WAS NOMINATED 
THE DEMOCRATIC SENATE LEADER 
SAID HE WOULDO MOSE WOULD 
OPPOSE ME WITH EVERYTHING HE 
HAS, ANOTHER DEMOCRAT REFERRED 
TO ME AS EVIL, EVIL. 
THINK ABOUT THAT WORD AND SAID 
THOSE WHO SUPPORTED ME WERE  
COMPLICIT IN EVIL. 
ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SAID 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH IS YOUR WORST 
NIGHTMARE. 
A FORMER HEAD OF THE DNC SAID 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH WILL THREATEN 
THE LIVES OF MILLIONS OF 
AMERICANS FOR DECADES TO COME. 
I UNDERSTAND THE PASSIONS OF 
THE MOMENT BUT I WOULD SAY TO 
THOSE SENATORS YOUR WORDS HAVE  
MEANING. 
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS LISTENED 
CAREFULLY TO YOU. 
GIVEN COMMENTS LIKE THOSE IS IT 
ANY SURPRISE THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
BEEN WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO 
MAKE ANY PHYSICAL THREAT 
AGAINST MY FAMILY? 
TO SEND ANY VIOLENT E-MAIL TO 
MY WIFE? 
TO MAKE ANY KIND OF ALLEGATION 
AGAINST ME AND AGAINST MY 
FRIENDS? 
TO BLOW ME UP AND TAKE ME DOWN? 
YOU SOWED THE WIND, FOR DECADES 
TO COME I FEAR THAT THE WHOLE 
COUNTRY WILL REAP THE 
WHIRLWIND. 
THE BEHAVIOR OF SEVERAL OF THE 
DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THIS 
COMMITTEE AT MY HEARING A FEW 
WEEKS AGO AS AN EMBARRASSMENT. 
THOSE EFFORTS DIDN'T WORK. 
WHEN I DID AT LEAST OKAY ENOUGH 
AT THE HEARINGS THAT IT LOOKED 
LIKE I MAY GET CONFIRMED A NEW 
TACTIC WAS NEEDED. 
SOME OF YOU WERE LYING IN 
WEIGHT AND HAD IT READY. 
THIS FIRST ALLEGATION WAS HELD 
IN SECURITY FOR WEEKS BY A 
DEMOCRAT MEMBER OF THIS 
COMMITTEE AND BY STAFF. 
IT WOULD BE NEEDED ONLY IF YOU 
COULDN'T TAKE ME OUT ON THE 
MERITS. 
WHEN IT WAS NEEDED THIS 
ALLEGATION WAS UNLEASHED AND 
PUBLICLY DEPLOYED OVER DR. 
FORD'S WISHES. 
THEN, AND THEN  AS WAS NO DOUBT 
EXPECTED IF NOT PLANNED CAME A 
LONG SERIES OF LAST MINUTE 
SMEARS DESIGNED TO SCARE ME AND 
DRIVE ME OUT OF THE PROCESS 
BEFORE ANY HEARING HAPPENED. 
CRAZY STUFF, GANGS, FIGHTS ON 
BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND, 
CHILDREN, ALL NONE SENSE, 
REPORTED BREATHLESSLY BY THE 
MEDIA. 
THIS HAS DESTROYED MY FAMILY 
AND MY GOOD NAME. 
A GOOD NAME BUILT UP THROUGH 
DECADES OF HARD WORK AND PUBLIC 
SERVICE AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS 
OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. 
THIS WHOLE TWO WEEK EFFORT HAS 
BEEN A CALCULATED AND 
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT 
FUELED WITH PENT UP ANGER ABOUT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE 2016 
ELECTION, FEAR THAT HAS BEEN 
UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT MY 
RECORD, REVENGE ON BEHALF OF 
THE  CLINTONS, AND MILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS IN MONEY FROM OUTSIDE 
LEFT WING OPPOSITION GROUPS. 
THIS IS A CIRCUS. 
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL EXTEND 
LONG PAST MY NOMINATION. 
THE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE WITH 
US FOR DECADES. 
THIS GROTESQUE AND COORDINATED 
CHARACTER ASSASSINATION WILL 
DISSU ADE GOOD PEOPLE OF ALL 
POLITICAL AREAS SERVING OUR 
COUNTRY AND AS WE KNOW IN THE 
POLITICAL SYSTEM OF THE EARLY 
2,000'S WHAT GOES AROUND COMES 
AROUND. 
I AM AN OPTIMISTIC GUY. 
I ALWAYS TRY TO BE ON THE 
SUNRISE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. 
TO BE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE DAY 
THAT IS COMING. 
TODAY, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I 
FEAR FOR THE FUTURE. 
LAST TIME I WAS HERE I TOLD 
THIS COMMITTEE THAT A JUDGE 
MUST BE INDEPENDENT, NOT SWAYED 
BY PUBLIC OR POLITICAL 
PRESSURE. 
I SAID I WAS SUCH A JUDGE AND I 
AM. 
I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED INTO 
WITHDRAWING FROM THIS PROCESS. 
YOU HAVE TRIED HARD. 
YOU HAVE GIVEN IT YOUR ALL. 
YOUR COORDINATE AND WELL FUNDED 
EFFORT TO DESTROY MY GOOD NAME 
AND DESTROY MY FAMILY WILL NOT 
DRIVE ME OUT. 
THE VILE THREATS OF VIOLENCE 
AGAINST MY FAMILY WILL NOT 
DRIVE ME OUT. 
YOU MAY DEFEAT ME IN THE FINAL 
VOTE BUT YOU WILL NEVER GET ME 
TO QUIT. 
NEVER. 
I'M HERE TODAY TO TELL THE 
TRUTH. 
I HAVE NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
ANYONE. 
NOT IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT IN 
COLLEGE, NOT EVER. 
SEXUAL ASSAULT IS HORRIFIC. 
ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS TO 
THIS DAY IS A WOMAN WHO WAS 
SEXUALLY ABUSED AND WHO IN THE 
90s WHEN WE WERE IN OUR 30s 
CONFIDED IN ME ABOUT THE ABUSE. 
SHE SOUGHT MY ADVICE. 
I WAS ONE OF THE ONLY PEOPLE 
SHE CONSULTED. 
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT 
MUST ALWAYS BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY, 
ALWAYS. 
THOSE WHO MAKE ALLEGATIONS 
ALWAYS DESERVE TO BE HEARD. 
AT THE SAME TIME THE PERSON WHO 
IS THE SUBJECT OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS ALSO DESERVES TO BE 
HEARD. 
DUE PROCESS IS A FOUNDATION OF 
THE AMERICAN RULE OF LAW. 
DUE PROCESS MEANS LISTENING TO 
BOTH SIDES.
AS I TOLD YOU AT MY HEARING 
THREE WEEKS AGO I'M THE ONLY 
CHILD OF MY PARENTS. 
THEY ARE HERE TODAY. 
WHEN I WAS TEN MY MOM WENT TO 
LAW SCHOOL AND AS A LAWYER SHE 
WORKED HARD AND OVERCAME 
BARRIERS INCLUDING THE 
WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
THAT SO MANY WOMEN FACED AT THE 
TIME AND STILL FACE TODAY. 
SHE BECAME A TRAILBLAZER. 
ONE OF MARYLAND'S EARLIEST 
WOMEN PROSECUTORS AND TRIAL 
JUDGES. 
THEY TAUGHT ME THE IMPORTANCE 
OF EQUALITY AND RESPECT FOR ALL 
PEOPLE AND SHE INSPIRED ME TO 
BE A LAWYER AND A JUDGE. 
LAST TIME I WAS HERE I TOLD YOU 
THAT WHEN MY MOM WAS A 
PROSECUTOR AND I WAS IN HIGH 
SCHOOL SHE USED TO PRACTICE HER 
CLOSING ARGUMENTS AT THE DINING 
ROOM TABLE ON MY DAD AND ME. 
AS I TOLD YOU HER TRADEMARK 
LINE WAS USE YOUR COMMON SENSE, 
WHAT RINGS TRUE? 
WHAT RINGS FALSE? 
HER TRADEMARK LINE IS A GOOD 
REMINDER AS WE SIT HERE TODAY, 
SOME 36 YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED 
EVENT HAPPENED, WHEN THERE IS 
NO EVIDENCE AND IT IS REFUTED 
BY THE PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY THERE. 
AFTER I HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC 
ARENA FOR 26 YEARS WITHOUT EVEN 
A HINT, A WHIFF OF ANY 
ALLEGATION LIKE THIS, AND WHEN 
MY NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME 
COURT WAS JUST ABOUT TO BE 
VOTED ON AT A TIME WHEN I'M 
CALLED EVIL BY A DEMOCRATIC 
MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE, WHILE 
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS SAY PEOPLE 
WILL DIE IF I'M CONFIRMED. 
THIS ONSLAUGHT OF LAST MINUTE 
ALLEGATIONS DOES NOT RING TRUE. 
I'M NOT QUESTIONING THAT DR. 
FORD MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY 
ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON IN 
SOMEPLACE AT SOME TIME. 
I HAVE NEVER DONE THIS TO HER 
OR TO ANYONE. 
THAT'S NOT WHO I AM. 
IT IS NOT WHO I WAS. 
I AM INNOCENT OF THIS CHARGE. 
I INTEND NO ILL WILL TO DR. 
FORD AND HER FAMILY. 
THE OTHER NIGHT ASHLEY AND MY 
DAUGHTER SAID THEIR PRAYERS AND 
LIZA, ALL TEN YEARS OLD, SAID 
TO ASHLEY WE SHOULD PRAY FOR 
THE WOMAN -- THAT'S A LOT OF 
WISDOM FROM A 10-YEAR-OLD. 
WE MEAN NO ILL WILL --  
FIRST, LET'S START WITH MY 
CAREER. 
FOR THE LAST 26 YEARS SINCE 
1992, I HAVE SERVED IN MANY 
HIGH PROFILE AND SENSITIVE 
GOVERNMENT POSITIONS FOR WHICH 
THE FBI HAS INVESTIGATED MY 
BACKGROUND SIX SEPARATE TIMES. 
SIX SEPARATE TIME FBI 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS OVER 
26 YEARS. 
ALL OF THEM AFTER THE EVENT 
ALLEGED HERE. 
I HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC ARENA 
AND UNDER EXTREME PUBLIC 
SCRUTINQ FOR DECADES. 
IN 1992 I WORKED FOR THE OFFICE 
OF SOLICITOR GENERAL IN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. 
IN 1993 I CLERKED ON THE 
SUPREME COURT FOR JUSTICE 
ANTHONY KENNEDY. 
I SPENT FOUR YEARS OF THE 
INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S OFFICE IN 
THE 90s. 
IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF HUGE  
SCRUTINY FROM THE MEDIA AND THE 
PUBLIC. 
OUR OFFICE DURING THE CLINTON 
IMPEACH HELICOPTER, AND I 
PERSONALLY WERE IN THE MIDDLE 
OF AN INTENSE NATIONAL MEDIA 
SPOTLIGHT. 
I AND OTHER LEADING MEMBERS OF 
KEN STARR'S OFFICE WERE 
OPPOSITION RESEARCHED FROM HEAD 
TO TOE, FROM BIRTH THROUGH THE 
PRESENT DAY. 
RECALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE 
EXPOSED THAT YEAR OF 1998 IN 
SEXUAL WRONGDOING IN THEIR 
PAST. 
ONE PERSON ON THE LEFT EVEN 
PAID A MILLION DOLLARS FOR 
PEOPLE TO REPORT EVIDENCE OF 
SEXUAL WRONGDOING AND IT 
WORKED. 
HE EXPOSED SOME PROMINENT 
PEOPLE. 
NOTHING ABOUT ME. 
FROM 2001 TO 2006 I WORKED FOR 
PRESIDENT GEORGE W BUSH IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE AS STAFF SECRETARY 
I WAS BY HIS SIDE FOR THREE 
YEARS AND WAS ENTRUSTED WITH 
THE NATION'S MOST SENSITIVE 
SECRETS. 
I TRAVELED ON AIR FORCE ONE ALL 
OVER THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD 
WITH PRESIDENT BUSH. 
I WENT EVERYWHERE WITH HIM FROM 
TEXAS TO PAKISTAN, FROM ALASKA 
TO AUSTRALIA, FROM BUCKINGHAM 
PALACE TO THE VATICAN. 
THREE YEARS IN THE WEST WING, 
FIVE AND A HALF IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
I WAS THEN NOMINATED TO BE A 
JUDGE ON THE DC CIRCUIT. 
I WAS VETTED BY THE WHITE 
HOUSE, THE FBI, THE AMERICAN 
BAR ASSOCIATION AND THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
I SAT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE FOR 
TWO CONFIRMATION HEARINGS IN 
2004 AND 2006. 
FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS LEADING 
UP TO MY NOMINATION FOR THIS 
JOB I HAVE SERVED IN A VERY 
PUBLIC ARENA AS A FEDERAL JUDGE 
ON WHAT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO AS 
THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT COURT 
IN THE COUNTRY. 
I HAVE HANDLED SOME OF THE MOST 
SIGNIFICANT AND SENSITIVE CASES 
AFFECTING THE LIVES AND 
LIBERTIES OF THE AMERICAN 
PEOPLE. 
I HAVE BEEN A GOOD JUDGE. 
FOR THIS NOMINATION ANOTHER FBI 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION. 
ANOTHER AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION INVESTIGATION. 
31 HOURS OF HEARINGS. 
65 SENATOR MEETINGS. 
1200 WRITTEN QUESTIONS. 
MORE THAN ALL PREVIOUS SUPREME 
COURT NOMINEES COMBINED. 
THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE TIME, 
THROUGHOUT MY 53 YEARS AND 
SEVEN MONTHS ON THIS EARTH 
UNTIL LAST WEEK NOBODY EVER 
ACCUSED ME OF ANY KIND OF 
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. 
NOBODY. 
EVER. 
A LIFETIME, A LIFETIME OF 
PUBLIC SERVICE AND A LIFETIME 
OF HIGH PROFILE PUBLIC SERVICE 
AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF 
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. 
NEVER A HINT OF ANYTHING OF 
THIS KIND. 
THAT'S BECAUSE NOTHING OF THIS 
KIND EVER HAPPENED. 
SECOND, LET'S TURN TO 
SPECIFICS. 
I DENY THE ALLEGATION AGAINST 
ME BY DR. FORD. 
I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL OR 
PHYSICAL ENCOUNTER OF ANY KIND 
WITH DR. FORD. 
I NEVER ATTENDED A GATHERING 
LIKE THE ONE DR. FORD DESCRIBED 
IN HER ALLEGATIONS. 
I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED DR. 
FORD OR ANYONE. 
AGAIN, I AM NOT QUESTIONING 
THAT DR. FORD MAY HAVE BEEN 
ASSAULTED BY SOME PERSON IN 
SOMEPLACE AT SOME TIME. 
I HAVE NEVER DONE THAT TO HER 
OR TO ANYONE. 
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS STEMS 
FROM A PARTY THAT SHE ALLEGES 
HAPPENED DURING THE SUMMER OF 
1982. 
36 YEARS AGO. 
I WAS 17 YEARS OLD. 
BETWEEN MY JUNIOR AND SENIOR 
YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL AT 
GEORGETOWN PREP. 
A ALL BOYS CATHOLIC JESUIST 
HIGH SCHOOL IN ROCKVILLE 
MARYLAND. 
WHEN MY FRIENDS AND I SPENT 
TIME TOGETHER AT PARTIES ON 
WEEKENDS IT WAS USUALLY WITH 
FRIENDS FROM NEARBY CATHOLIC, 
ALL GIRL HIGH SCHOOLS, STONE 
RIDGE, HOLY CHILD, VISITATION, 
HOLY CROSS. 
DR. FORD DID NOT ATTEND ANY OF 
THOSE SCHOOLS. 
SHE ATTENDED AN INDEPENDENT 
PRIVATE SCHOOL NAMED HOLTON 
ARMS AND SHE WAS A YEAR BEHIND 
ME. 
SHE AND I DID NOT TRAVEL IN THE 
SAME SOCIAL CIRCLES. 
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MET AT 
SOME POINT AT SOME EVENTS 
THOUGH I DO NOT RECALL THAT. 
TO REPEAT, ALL OF THE PEOPLE 
IDENTIFIED BY DR. FORD AS BEING 
PRESENT AT THE PARTY HAVE SAID 
THEY DO NOT REMEMBER ANY SUCH 
PARTY EVER HAPPENING. 
IMPORTANTLY HER FRIEND MISS 
KAISER HAS DENIED KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE PARTY, SHE HAS SAID UNDER 
PENALTY OF FELONY THAT SHE DOES 
NOT KNOW ME, DOES NOT RECALL 
EVER BEING AT A PARTY WITH ME, 
EVER. 
MY TWO MALE FRIENDS WHO WERE 
ALLEGEDLY THERE, WHO KNEW ME 
WELL, HAVE TOLD THIS COMMITTEE 
UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY THAT 
THEY DO NOT RECALL ANY SUCH 
PARTY AND THAT I NEVER DID OR 
WOULD DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS. 
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATION IS NOT 
MERELY UNSUBASSISTANTED BUT IT 
IS REFUTED BY THE VERY PEOPLE 
SHE SAYS WERE THERE INCLUDING 
BY A LONG TIME FRIEND OF HERS. 
REFUTEED. 
THIRD, DR. FORD HAS SAID THAT 
THIS EVENT HAPPENED AT A HOUSE 
NEAR COLUMBIA COUNTRY CLUB 
WHICH IS AT THE CORNER OF 
CONNECTICUT AVENUE AND EAST 
WEST HIGHWAY IN CHEVY CHASE 
MARYLAND. 
IN HER LETTER TO SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN SHE SAID THERE WERE 
FOUR OTHER PEOPLE AT THE HOUSE. 
NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, NOR I 
LIVE NEAR COLUMBIA COUNTRY 
CLUB. 
AS OF THE SUMMER OF 1982 DR. 
FORD WAS 15 AND COULD NOT DRIVE 
YET. 
SHE DID NOT LIVE NEAR COLUMBIA 
COUNTRY CLUB. 
SHE SAYS THAT SHE HAD ONE BEER 
AT THE PARTY BUT SHE DOESN'T 
SAY HOW SHE GOT TO THE HOUSE IN 
QUESTION OR HOW SHE GOT HOME OR 
WHO SE HOUSE IT WAS. 
I HAVE SUBMITTED DETAILED 
CALENDARS RECORDING MY 
ACTIVITIES IN THE SUMMER OF 
1982. 
WHY DID I KEEP CALENDARS? 
MY DAD STARTED TO KEEP DETAILED 
CALENDARS OF HIS LIFE IN 1978. 
HE DID SO AS BOTH A CALENDAR 
AND A DIARY IS HE A VERY 
ORGANIZED GUY TO PUT IT MILDLY. 
CHRISTMAS TIME WE SIT AROUND 
AND HE WOULD TELL US ABOUT OLD 
STORIES. 
OLD MILESTONES, OLD WEDDINGS, 
OLD EVENTS FROM HIS CALENDARS.
IN 9TH GRADE -- IN 9TH GRADE IN 
1980 I STARTED KEEPING 
CALENDARS OF MY OWN. 
FOR ME ALSO IT'S BOTH A 
CALENDAR AND A DIARY. 
I HAVE KEPT SUCH CALENDARS FOR 
THE LAST 38 YEARS. 
MINE ARE NOT AS GOOD AS MY 
DAD'S IN SOME YEARS. 
WHEN I WAS A KID THE CALENDARS 
ARE ABOUT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT 
FROM A KID. 
SOME GOOFY PARTS, SOME 
EMBARRASSING PARTS. 
I DID HAVE THE SUMMER OF 1982 
DOCUMENTED PRETTY WELL. 
THE EVENT DESCRIBED BY DR. FORD 
SUPPOSEDLY HAPPENED ON A 
WEEKEND BECAUSE I BELIEVE 
EVERYBODY WORKED AND HAD JOBS 
IN THE SUMERNS. 
IN ANY EVENT A DRUNK, EARLY 
EVENING EVENT OF THE KIND SHE 
DESCRIBES SUPPOSEDLY HAPPENED 
ON A WEEKEND. 
IF IT WAS A WEEKEND, MY 
CALENDAR SHOWS THAT I WAS OUT 
OF TOWN ALMOST EVERY WEEKEND 
NIGHT BEFORE FOOTBALL TRAINING 
CAMP STARTED IN LATE AUGUST. 
THE ONLY WEEKEND NIGHTS THAT I 
WAS IN DC WERE FRIDAY JUNE 4TH 
WHEN I WAS WITH MY DAD AT A 
PROGOLF TOURNAMENT AND HAD MY 
HIGH SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT TEST AT 
8:30 THE NEXT MORNING. 
I ALSO WAS IN DC ON SATURDAY 
NIGHT AUGUST 7TH, BUT I WAS AT 
A SMALL GATHERING AT BECKY'S 
HOUSE IN ROCKVILLE WITH MATT, 
DENISE, LO RI AND JENNIE. 
THEIR NAMES ARE ALL LISTED ON 
MY CALENDAR. 
I WON'T USE THEIR LAST NAMES 
HERE. 
THEN ON THE WEEKEND OF AUGUST 
20 TO 22ND I WAS STAYING AT THE 
GARRET'S WITH PAT AND CHRIS AS 
WE PREPARED FOR FOOTBALL 
TRAINING CAMP. 
AS THE CALENDARS CONFIRM THAT 
WEEKEND BEFORE A BRUTAL 
FOOTBALL TRAINING CAMP SCHEDULE 
WAS NO TIME FOR PARTIES. 
LET ME SAY THIS POINT. 
IF THE PARTY DESCRIBED BY DR. 
FORD HAPPENED IN THE SUMMER OF 
1982 ON A WEEKEND NIGHT MY 
CALENDAR SHOWS THAT I WAS NOT 
THERE. 
DURING THE WEEKDAYS IN THE 
SUMMER OF 1982 AS YOU CAN SEE I 
WAS OUT OF TOWN FOR TWO WEEKS 
OF THE SUMMER FOR A TRIP TO THE 
BEACH WITH FRIENDS AND AT THE 
ALLEGEDLY FIVE STAR BASKETBALL 
CAMP IN PENNSYLVANIA. 
WHEN I WAS IN TOWN I SPENT MUCH 
OF MY TIME WORKING, WORKING 
OUT, LIFTING WEIGHTS, PLAYING 
BASKETBALL, OR HANGING OUT AND 
HAVING BEERS WITH FRIENDS AS WE 
TALKED ABOUT LIFE AND FOOTBALL 
AND SCHOOL AND  GIRLS. 
SOME HAVE NOTICED THAT I DIDN'T 
HAVE CHURCH ON SUNDAYS ON MY 
CALENDARS. 
I ALSO DIDN'T LIST BRUSHING MY 
TEETH AND FOR ME GOING TO 
CHURCH ON SUNDAYS WAS LIKE 
BRUSHING MY TEETH, AUTOMATIC. 
STILL IS. 
IN THE SUMMER OF 1981 I WORKED 
CONSTRUCTION. 
IN THE SUMMER OF 1982 MY JOB 
WAS CUTTING LAWNS. 
I HAD MY OWN BUSINESS OF SORTS. 
YOU SEE SOME SPECIFICS ABOUT 
THE LAWN CUTTING LISTED ON THE 
AUGUST CALENDAR PAGE WHEN I HAD 
TO TIME THE LAST LAWN CUTTINGS 
OF THE SUMMER OF VARIOUS LAWNS 
BEFORE FOOTBALL TRAINING CAMP. 
I PLAYED IN A LOT OF SUMMER 
LEAGUE BASKETBALL GAMES FOR THE 
GEORGETOWN PREP TEAM AT NIGHT, 
AT BLAIR HIGH SCHOOL IN SILVER 
SPRING. 
MANY NIGHTS I WORKED OUT WITH 
OTHER GUYS AT TOB IN'S HOUSE. 
HE WAS THE GREAT QUARTERBACK ON 
OUR FOOTBALL TEAM. 
HIS DAD RAN WORKOUTS OR LIFTED 
WEIGHTS AT GEORGETOWN PREP IN 
PREPARATION FOR THE FOOTBALL 
SEASON. 
I ATTENDED AND WATCHED MANY 
SPORTING EVENTS AS IS MY HABIT 
TO THIS DAY. 
THE CALENDARS SHOW A FEW 
WEEKDAY GATHERING AT FRIEND'S 
HOUSES AFTER A WORK BUT NONE OF 
THOSE INCLUDED THE GROUP OF 
PEOPLE THAT DR. FORD HAS 
IDENTIFIED. 
AS MY CALENDARS SHOW I WAS VERY 
PRECISE ABOUT LISTING WHO WAS 
THERE. 
VERY PRECISE. 
MY CALENDARS ALSO WERE DIARIES 
OF SORTS, FORWARD LOOKING AND 
BACKWARD LOOKING JUST LIKE MY 
DADS. 
YOU CAN SEE FOR EXAMPLE THAT I 
CROSSED OUT MISSED WORKOUTS AND 
THE CANCELED DOCTOR'S 
APPOINTMENTS AND THAT I LISTED 
THE PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP FOR 
CERTAIN EVENTS. 
THE CALENDARS ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT 
D ESPOSITIVE ON THEIR OWN WITH 
YOU THEY ARE ANOTHER PIECE OF 
EVIDENCE IN THE MIX FOR YOU TO 
CONSIDER.  
5TH, DR. FORD'S ALLEGATION IS 
RADICALLY  INCONSISTENT WITH MY 
CHARACTER AND RECORD. 
MANY OF US WERE FRIENDS AT MY 
SCHOOL AND REMAINED FRIENDS TO 
THIS DAY WITH STUDENTS AT LOCAL 
CATHOLIC ALL GIRLS SCHOOLS. 
ONE FEATURE OF MY LIFE THAT HAS 
REMAINED TRUE TO THE PRESENT 
DAY IS THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A 
LOT OF CLOSE FEMALE FRIENDS. 
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT 
GIRLFRIENDS. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT FRIENDS WHO 
ARE WOMEN.  
THAT STARTED IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I'M AN 
ONLY CHILD AND HAD NO SISTERS 
BUT ANY WAY WE HAD NO SOCIAL 
MEDIA OR TEXTS OR E-MAIL AND WE 
TALKED ON THE PHONE. 
I REMEMBER TALKING ALMOST EVERY 
NIGHT IT SEEMED TO MY FRIENDS 
AMY OR JULIE OR KRISTIN OR 
KAREN OR SUZANNE OR NIKI. 
THE LIST GOES ON. 
FRIEND FORS A LIFETIME. 
BOIL ON A FOUNDATION OF TALKING 
THROUGH SCHOOL AND LIFE 
STARTING AT AGE 14. 
SEVERAL OF THOSE GREAT WOMEN 
ARE IN THE SEATS BEHIND ME 
TODAY. 
MY FRIENDS AND I SOMETIMES GOT 
TOGETHER AND HAD PARTIES ON 
WEEKENDS. 
THE DRINKING AGE WAS 18 IN 
MARYLAND FOR MOST OF MY TIME IN 
HIGH SCHOOL AND WAS 18 IN DC 
FOR ALL OF MY TIME. 
I DRANK BEER WITH MY FRIENDS. 
ALMOST EVERYBODY DID. 
SOMETIMES I HAD TOO MANY BEERS. 
SOMETIMES OTHERS DID. 
I LIKED BEER. 
I STILL LIKE BEER. 
I DID NOT DRINK BEER TO THE 
POINT OF BLACKING OUT. 
I NEVER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED 
ANYONE. 
THERE IS A LINE BETWEEN 
DRINKING BEER AND ASSAULTING 
SOMEONE WHICH IS A VIOLENT 
CRIME. 
IF EVERY AMERICAN WHO DRINKS 
BEER OR EVERY AMERICAN WHO 
DRANK BEER IN HIGH SCHOOL IS 
SUDDENLY PRESUMED GUILTY OF 
SEXUAL ASSAULT WE WILL BE IN AN 
UGLY NEW PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY. 
I NEVER COMMITTED SEXUAL 
ASSAULT. 
AS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WE 
SOMETIMES DID GOOFY OR STUPID 
THINGS. 
I DOUBT WE WERE ALONE IN 
LOOKING BACK AT HIGH SCHOOL AND 
DRINKING AT SOME THINGS. 
FOR ONE THING OUR YEAR BOOK WAS 
A DISASTER. 
I THINK SOME EDITORS AND 
STUDENTS WANTED THE YEAR BOOK 
TO BE SOME COMBINATION OF 
ANIMAL HOUSE, CADDY SHACK AND 
FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH 
WHICH WERE ALL RECENT MOVIES. 
MANY OF US WENT TOA LOANING 
WITH IT TO THE POINT OF 
ABSURDITY. 
THIS PAST WEEK --  
WHEN WE READ ABOUT IT AND 
TALKED TO EACH OTHER.  
ONE THING IN PARTICULAR WE WERE 
SAD ABOUT ONE OF OUR GOOD --  
ONE OF OUR GOOD FEMALE FRIENDS 
WHO WE WOULD ADMIRE AND WENT TO 
DANCES WITH HAD HER NAME USED 
ON A YEAR BOOK PAGE WITH THE 
TERM ALUMNUS. 
IT WAS INTENDED TO SHOW 
AFFECTION AND THAT SHE WAS ONE 
OF US. 
IN THIS CIRCUS THE MEDIA HAS 
DECIDED THE TERM WAS RELATED TO 
SEX. 
IT WAS NOT RELATED TO SEX. 
THE WOMAN HERSELF NOTED ON THE 
RECORD IN THE MEDIA SHE AND I 
NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 
INTERACTION AT ALL. 
SO SORRY TO HER FOR THAT YEAR 
BOOK REFERENCE. 
THIS MAY SOUND A BIT TRIVIAL 
GIVING ALL THAT WE ARE HERE FOR 
BUT ONE THING I WANT TO TRY TO 
MAKE SURE OF IN THE FUTURE IS 
MY FRIENDSHIP WITH HER. 
SHE WAS AND IS A GREAT PERSON. 
AS TO SEX, THIS IS NOT A TOPIC 
I IMAGINED WOULD COME UP IN A 
CONFIRMATION HEARING BUT I WANT 
TO GIVE YOU A FULL PICTURE OF 
WHO I WAS. 
I NEVER HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE 
OR ANYTHING CLOSE TO IT DURING 
HIGH SCHOOL OR FOR MANY YEARS 
AFTER THAT. 
SOME CROWDS I WAS A LITTLE SHY 
ABOUT MY LACK OF EXPERIENCE. 
I TRIED TO HIDE THAT. 
THE SAME TIME I WAS ALSO 
INWARDLY PROUD OF IT. 
FOR ME AND THE GIRLS WHO I WAS 
FRIENDS WITH, THAT LACK OF 
MAJOR SEXUAL ACTIVITY WAS A 
MATTER OF FAITH AND RESPECT AND 
CAUTION. 
THE COMMITTEE HAS A LETTER FROM 
65 WOMEN WHO KNEW ME IN HIGH 
SCHOOL. 
THEY SAID THAT I ALWAYS TREATED 
THEM WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. 
THAT LETTER CAME TOGETHER IN 
ONE NIGHT, 35 YEARS AFTER 
GRADUATION WHILE A SEXUAL 
ASSAULT ALLEGATION WAS PENDING 
AGAINST ME IN A VERY FRAUGHT 
AND PUBLIC SITUATION WHERE THEY 
KNEW -- THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE 
VILIFIED IF THEY DEFENDED ME. 
THINK ABOUT THAT. 
THEY PUT THEIRS ON THE LINE FOR 
ME. 
THOSE ARE SOME GREAT WOMEN. 
I LOVE ALL OF THEM. 
YOU ALSO HAVE A LETTER FROM 
WOMEN WHO KNEW ME IN COLLEGE. 
MOST WERE VARSITY ATHLETES. 
THEY DESCRIBED THAT I TREATED 
THEM AS FRIENDS AND EQUALS AND 
SUPPORTED THEM IN THEIR SPORTS 
AT A TIME WHEN WOMEN'S SPORTS 
WAS COMING OUT IN THE WAKE OF 
TITLE 9. I THANK ALL OF THEM 
FOR ALL THEIR TEXTS, AND THEIR 
E-MAILS AND THEIR SUPPORT. 
ONE OF THOSE WOMEN FRIENDS FROM 
COLLEGE, A SELFDESCRIBED 
LIBERAL AND FEMINIST TEXTED ME 
LAST NIGHT THAT SAID, QUOTE, 
DEEP BREATHS, YOU ARE A GOOD 
MAN.  
A TEXT YET FROM ANOTHER OF 
THOSE FRIENDS SAID, QUOTE, 
BRETT, BE STRONG, PULLING FOR 
YOU TO MY CORE. 
A THIRD TEXT YESTERDAY FROM YET 
ANOTHER OF THOSE WOMEN I'M 
FRIENDS WITH FROM COLLEGE, SAID 
I'M HOLDING YOU IN THE LIGHT OF 
GOD. 
AS I SAID IN MY OPENING 
STATEMENT THE LAST TIME I WAS 
WITH YOU, CHERISH YOUR FRIENDS, 
LOOK OUT FOR YOUR FRIENDS, LIFT 
UP YOUR FRIENDS, LOVE YOUR 
FRIENDS. 
I FELT THAT LOVE MOREOVER THE 
LAST TWO WEEKS THAN I EVER HAVE 
IN MY LIFE.  
I WILL PUT MY RECORD UP AGAINST 
ANYONE'S, MALE OR FEMALE. 
I AM PROUD OF THE LETTER FROM 
84 WOMEN, 84 WOMEN WHO WORKED 
WITH ME AT THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE 
FROM 2001 TO 2006 AND DESCRIBED 
ME AS QUOTE, A MAN OF THE 
HIGHEST INTEGRITY. 
READ THE OPED FROM SARAH DAY 
FROM MAINE. 
SHE WORKED IN THE OVAL OFFICE 
OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF PRESIDENT 
BUSH'S OFFICE. 
HERE IS WHAT SHE WROTE IN 
CENTRAL MAINE.COM. 
THE TODAY SHE STANDS BY HER 
COMMENTS. 
QUOTE, BRETT ENCOURAGED ME TO 
TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND 
TO FEEL CONFIDENT IN MY ROLE. 
IN FACT DURING THE 2004 
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION 
BRETT GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO HELP WITH THE PREPARATION 
AND REVIEW OF THE PRESIDENT'S 
REMARKS, SOMETHING I NEVER -- 
SOMETHING I NEVER WOULD HAVE 
HAD THE CHANCE TO DO IF HE HAD 
NOT INCLUDED ME. 
HE DIDN'T JUST INCLUDE ME IN 
THE WORK. 
HE MADE SURE I WAS AT MADISON 
SQUARE GARDEN TO WATCH THE 
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH INSTEAD OF 
BACK AT THE HOTEL WATCHING IT 
ON TV. 
END QUOTE. 
AS A JUDGE SINCE 2006, I HAVE 
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF HIRING 
FOUR RECENT LAW SCHOOL 
GRADUATES TO SERVE AS MY LAW 
CLERKS EACH YEAR. 
THE LAW CLERKS FOR FEDERAL 
JUDGES THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST 
GRADUATES OF AMERICAN LAW  
SCHOOLS. 
THEY WORKED FOR ONE YEAR TERMS 
FOR JUDGES AND THEN THEY MOVE 
ON IN THEIR CAREERS. 
FOR JUDGES TRAINING THESE YOUNG 
LAWYERS IS AN IMPORTANT 
RESPONSIBILITY. 
THE CLERKS WILL BECOME THE NEXT 
GENERATION OF AMERICAN LAWYERS 
AND LEADERS, JUDGES AND  
SENATORS. 
JUST AFTER I TOOK THE BENCH IN 
2006 THERE WAS A MAJOR NEW YORK 
TIMES STORY ABOUT THE LOW 
NUMBERS OF WOMEN LAW CLERKS AT 
THE SUPREME COURT AND FEDERAL 
APPEALS COURTS. 
I TOOK NOTICE AND I TOOK 
ACTION. 
A MAJORITY OF MY 48 LAW CLERKS 
HAVE BEEN WOMEN. 
IN A LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE 
MY WOMEN LAW CLERKS SAID I WAS 
ONE OF THE STRONGEST ADVOCATES 
IN THE JUDICIARY FOR WOMEN 
LAWYERS AND THEY WROTE THAT THE 
LEGAL PROFESSION IS FAIRER AND 
MORE EQUAL BECAUSE OF ME. 
IN MY TIME ON THE BENCH NO 
FEDERAL JUDGE, NOT A SINGLE ONE 
IN THE COUNTRY HAS SENT MORE 
WOMEN LAW CLERKS TO CLERK ON 
THE SUPREME COURT THAN I HAVE. 
BEFORE THIS ALLEGATION TWO 
WEEKS AGO I WAS REQUIRED TO 
START MAKING CERTAIN 
PREPARATIONS FOR MY POSSIBLE 
TRANSFER TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
JUST IN CASE I WAS CONFIRMED. 
AS PART OF THAT I HAD TO 
POTENTIALLY HIRE A FIRST GROUP 
OF FOUR LAW CLERKS WHO COULD BE 
AVAILABLE TO CLERK AT THE 
SUPREME COURT FOR ME ON A 
MOMENT'S NOTICE. 
I DID SO AND HIRED FOUR LAW 
CLERKS. 
ALL FOUR ARE WOMEN. 
IF CONFIRMED I WILL BE THE 
FIRST JUSTICE IN THE HISTORY OF 
THE SUPREME COURT TO HAVE A 
GROUP OF ALL WOMEN LAW CLERKS. 
THAT IS WHO I AM. 
THAT IS WHO I WAS. 
OVER THE PAST 12 YEARS I HAVE 
TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW TO 
HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS, MAINLY AT 
HARVARD LAW SCHOOL WHILE I WAS 
HIRED BY THEN DEAN AND NOW 
JSTICE KAGAN. 
ONE OF MY FORMER WOMEN 
STUDENTS, A DEMOCRAT TESTIFIED 
TO THIS COMMITTEE THAT I WAS AN 
EVEN HANDED PROFESSOR WHO 
TREATS PEOPLE FAIRLY AND WITH 
RESPECT. 
IN A LETTER TO THIS COMMITTEE 
MY FORMER STUDENTS, MALE AND 
FEMALE ALIKE WROTE THAT I 
DISPLAYED A CHARACTER THAT 
IMPRESSED US ALL. 
I LOVED TEACHING LAW. 
THANKS TO WHAT SOME OF YOU ON 
THIS SIDE OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE 
UNLEASHED I MAY NEVER BE ABLE 
TO TEACH AGAIN. 
FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS I HAVE 
COACHED MY TWO DAUGHTERS 
BASKETBALL TEAMS. 
YOU SAW MANY OF THOSE GIRLS 
WHEN THEY CAME TO MY HEARING 
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. 
YOU HAVE A LETTER FROM THE 
PARENTS OF THE GIRLS I COACHED 
THAT DESCRIBED MY DEDICATION, 
COMMITMENT AND CHARACTER. 
I COACHED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT A 
GIRL'S CONFIDENCE ON THE 
BASKETBALL COURT TRANSLATES 
INTO CONFIDENCE IN OTHER 
ASPECTS OF LIFE.
I LOVE COACHING MORE THAN 
ANYTHING I HAVE EVER DONE IN MY 
WHOLE LIFE. 
THANKS TO WHAT SOME OF YOU ON 
THIS SIDE OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE 
UNLEASHED I MAY NEVER BE ABLE 
TO COACH AGAIN. 
I HAVE BEEN A JUDGE FOR 12 
YEARS. 
I HAVE A LONG RECORD OF SERVICE 
TO AMERICA AND TO THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
I REVERE THE CONSTITUTION. 
I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR NOMINATING 
ME. 
HE WAS SO GRACIOUS TO MY FAMILY 
AND ME ON THE JULY NIGHT THAT 
HE ANNOUNCED MY NOMINATION AT 
THE WHITE HOUSE. 
I THANK HIM FOR HIS STEADFAST 
SUPPORT. 
WHEN I ACCEPTED THE PRESIDENT'S 
NOMINATION ASHLEY AND I KNEW 
THIS PROCESS WOULD BE  
CHALLENGING. 
WE NEVER EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD 
DEVOLVE INTO THIS. 
EXPLAINING THIS TO OUR 
DAUGHTERS HAS BEEN ACT THE 
WORST EXPERIENCE OF OUR LIVES. 
ASHLEY HAS BEEN A ROCK. 
I THANK GOD EVERY DAY FOR 
ASHLEY AND MY FAMILY.  
WE LIVE IN A COUNTRY DEVOTED TO 
DUE PROCESS AND THE RULE OF 
LAW. 
THAT MEANS TAKING ALLEGATIONS 
SERIOUSLY. 
IF THE MERE ALLEGATION, THE 
MERE ASSERTION OF A REFUTED 
ALLEGATION FROM 36 YEARS AGO IS 
ENOUGH TO DESTROY A PERSON'S 
LIFE AND CAREER WE WILL HAVE 
ABANDONED THE BASIC PRINCIPLES 
OF FAIRNESS AND DUE PROCESS 
THAT DEFINE OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IN 
OUR COUNTRY. 
I ASK YOU TO JUDGE ME BY THE 
STANDARD THAT YOU WOULD WANT 
APPLIED TO YOUR FATHER, YOUR 
HUSBAND, YOUR BROTHER, OR YOUR 
SON. 
MY FAMILY AND I INTEND NO ILL 
WILL TOWARD DR. FORD OR HER 
FAMILY. 
I SWEAR TODAY UNDER OATH BEFORE 
THE SENATE AND THE NATION, 
BEFORE MY FAMILY AND GOD, I AM 
INNOCENT OF THIS CHARGE. 
>>  THANK YOU JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
BEFORE WE START QUESTIONS, I 
WON'T REPEAT WHAT I SAID THIS 
MORNING BUT WE WILL DO IT THE 
SAME WAY AS WE DID FOR DR. 
FORD. 
FIVE MINUTE ROUNDS AND SO WE 
WILL START WITH MISS MITCHELL. 
WITH MS MITCHELL. 
>>> GOOD AFTERNOON JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH. 
I WANT TO GO OVER A COUPLE OF 
GUIDELINES FOR THE QUESTION AND 
ANSWER SESSION TODAY. 
IF I ASK A QUESTION -- 
>>  I'M READY. 
>>  OKAY. 
IF A ASK A QUESTION. 
THANK YOU. 
>>  IF I ASK A QUESTION YOU DO 
NOT UNDERSTAND PLEASE ASK ME 
CLARIFY IT. 
I MAY ASK A QUESTION WITH 
INFORMATION YOU HAVE ALREADY 
PROVIDED. 
IDENTIFY GET IT WRONG PLEASE 
CORRECT ME. 
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK YOU TO 
GUESS, IF YOU DO ESTIMATE 
PLEASE LET ME KNOW. 
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF 
THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE 
GOTTEN A COPY OF THE DEFINITION 
OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR. 
>>  YES. 
AT LEAST I HAVE ONE. 
>>  AND YOU AS WELL? 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 
>>  YEAH. 
>>  OKAY. 
FIRST HAVE YOU BEEN GIVEN OR 
REVIEWED A COPY OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT I WILL BE ASKING 
YOU? 
>>  NO. 
>>  HAS ANYONE TOLD YOU THE 
QUESTIONS I WILL ASK YOU? 
>>  NO. 
>>  I WANT YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT 
TO REVIEW THE DEFINITION THAT'S 
BEFORE YOU OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR.  
HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW 
IT? 
>>  I HAVE. 
I MAY REFER BACK TO IT IF I 
CAN. 
>>  YES, PLEASE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT TWO 
SPECIFIC PARTS. 
AMONG THE EXAMPLES OF SEXUAL 
BEHAVIOR IT INCLUDES RUBBING OR 
GRINDING YOUR GENITALS AGAINST 
SOMEONE, CLOTHED OR UNCLOTHED. 
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE 
DEFINITION APPLIES WHETHER OR 
NOT THE ACTS WERE SEXUALLY 
MOTIVATED OR HORSE PLAY FOR 
EXAMPLE. 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE 
DEFINITION I HAVE GIVEN YOU? 
>>  I DO. 
>>  AGAIN IF IT YOU NEED TO 
REVIEW THAT PLEASE LET ME KNOW. 
>>  DR. FORD HAS STATED THAT 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN FIVE OR SIX 
PEOPLE WERE PRESENT AT THE 
GATHERING ON THIS DATE. 
YOU, MARK JUDGE, LELAND INGRAM 
AT THE TIME, OR KA ISER NOW, PJ 
SMITH, DR. FORD AND AN UNNAMED 
BOY. 
TOUR KNOW MARK JUDGE? 
>>  I DO. 
>>  HOW DO YOU KNOW HIM? 
>>  HE WAS A FRIEND AT 
GEORGETOWN PREP STARTING IN 9TH 
GRADE. 
HE IS A -- SOMEONE WE WOULD -- 
IN OUR -- YOU KNOW GROUP OF 
FRIENDS WERE VERY FRIENDLY 
GROUP IN CLASS. 
YOU SAW THE LETTER THAT'S BEEN 
SENSE BY MY FRIEND FROM 
GEORGETOWN PREP. 
FUNNY GUY. 
GREAT WRITER. 
POPULAR. 
DEVELOPED A SERIOUS ADDICTION 
PROBLEM THAT LASTED DECADES. 
NEAR DEATH A COUPLE OF TIMES 
FROM HIS ADDICTION. 
SUFFERED A LOT FROM -- 
>>  WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
WITH HIM LIKE NOW? 
>>  I WOULD TALK TO HIM IN A 
COUPLE OF YEARS. 
WE HAVE PROBABLY BEEN ON MASSEY 
MAILS OR GROUP E-MAILS THAT GO 
AROUND. 
>>  DID YOU 
WE PLAYED FOOTBALL TOGETHER. 
HE WAS A DEFENSIVE TACKLE. 
I WAS THE QUARTERBACK AND WIDE 
RECEIVER. 
WE CARPOOLED TO SCHOOL, ALONG 
WITH DAVIS EVERY YEAR. 
THE THREE OF US FOR 2 YEARS. 
I DID NOT HAVE A CAR, SO WE 
WOULD DRIVE EVERY DAY IN THEY 
WOULD PICK ME UP. 
>> WHAT IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP 
LIKE WITH HIM NOW? 
>> HE LIVES IN THE AREA. 
I SEE HIM ONCE IN A WHILE. 
I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THIS 
THING. 
>> DO YOU KNOW LELAND INCOME OR 
LELAND KEISER? 
>> I KNOW OF HER. 
IT IS POSSIBLE. 
I MET HER IN HIGH SCHOOL AT 
SOME POINT. 
I KNOW OF HER. 
I DON'T WANT TO RULE OUT HAVING 
CROSS PASSIVE IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
>> SO MUCH YOUR STATEMENTS OF 
KNOWING DR. FORD? 
>> CORRECT. 
>> SENATOR FEINSTEIN.  
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, IT IS MY 
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU HAVE 
DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS BY DR. 
FORD, MS. RAMIREZ, AND MS. 
SWETNICK.  
ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE ASKED THE 
FBI TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS. 
I HAVE LISTENED TO WHAT YOU 
HAVE SAID. 
YOUR CONCERN IS EVIDENT AND 
CLEAR. 
IF YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT OF 
YOUR POSITION AND YOU APPEAR TO 
BE, WHY AREN'T YOU ALSO ASKING 
THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THESE 
CLAIMS? 
>> SENATOR, I WILL DO WHATEVER 
THE COMMITTEE WANTS. 
I WANTED A HEARING THE DAY 
AFTER THE ALLEGATION CAME UP. 
I WANTED TO BE HERE THAT DAY. 
INSTEAD, 10 DAYS PAST WERE ALL 
THIS NONSENSE IS COMING OUT. I 
AM ON GANGS. 
I AM ON BOATS IN RHODE ISLAND. 
I AM IN COLORADO, I AM CITED 
ALL OVER THE PLACE. 
THE THINGS ARE PRINTED AND RUN 
BREATHLESSLY BY CABLE NEWS. 
I WANTED A HEARING THE NEXT DAY.
MY FAMILY HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY 
THIS, SENATOR. 
DESTROYED. 
WHATEVER THE COMMITTEE DECIDES, 
I AM ALL IN. 
>> THE QUESTION IS -- 
>> I AM ALL IN. 
>> THE TERRIBLE AND HARD PART 
OF THIS IS THAT WHEN WE GET AN 
ALLEGATION, WE ARE NOT IN A 
POSITION TO PROVE IT OR 
DISPROVE IT. 
HAVE TO DEPEND ON SOME OUTSIDE 
AUTHORITY FOR IT. 
IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THE THAT 
WHEN THE ALLEGATIONS CAME 
FORWARD, THAT YOU WOULD WANT 
THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE THOSE 
CLAIMS AND CLEAR IT UP ONCE AND 
FOR ALL. 
>> SENATOR, THE COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATES -- IT IS NOT FOR 
ME TO SAY HOW TO DO IT, BUT 
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THE FBI DOES 
NOT COME TO A CONCLUSION. 
THEY WOULD GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF 
302 THAT JUST TELLS YOU WHAT WE 
SAID. 
I AM HERE. 
I WANTED TO BE HERE THE NEXT 
DAY. 
IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT I WAS NOT 
ALLOWED TO COME AND IMMEDIATELY 
DEFEND MY NAME AND SAY, I DID 
NOT DO THIS AND GIVE YOU ALL OF 
THE EVIDENCE. 
I AM NOT EVEN IN D.C. ON THE 
WEEKENDS IN THE SUMMER OF 1982. 
THIS HAPPENED ON A WEEKDAY? 
I'M NOT AT A SUMMER LEAGUE 
GAME? 
I'M NOT WORKING OUT? 
I'M NOT IN A MOVIE WITH SUZANNE?
I WANTED TO BE HERE RIGHT AWAY. 
>> THE DIFFICULT THING IS THAT 
THESE HEARINGS ARE SET BY THE 
MAJORITY, BUT I AM TALKING ABOUT
GETTING THE EVIDENCE AND HAVING 
THE EVIDENCE LOOKED AT. I DO 
NOT UNDERSTAND -- WE HEAR FROM 
THE WITNESSES, BUT THE FBI IS 
NOT INTERVIEWING THEM AND IS 
NOT GIVING US ANY FACTS. 
SO WE HAVE. 
>> YOU ARE INTERVIEWING ME. 
YOU ARE INTERVIEWING ME. 
YOU ARE DOING IT, SENATOR. 
I AM SORRY TO INTERRUPT, BUT 
YOU'RE DOING IT. 
THERE IS NO CONCLUSIONS 
REACHED. 
>> WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, IF I 
UNDERSTAND IT, IS AT THE 
ALLEGATIONS BY DR. FORD, MS. 
RAMIREZ, AND MS. SWETNICK  ARE 
WRONG. 
>> THAT IS EMPHATICALLY WHAT I 
AM SAYING. 
EMPHATICALLY. úTHE SWETNICK THI 
THAT IS A FARCE. 
>> WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY MORE 
ABOUT IT? 
>> NO. 
>> THAT IS IT. 
THANK YOU, MR CHAIRMAN. 
>> DR. FORD HAS DESCRIBED YOU 
AS BEING INTOXICATED AT A 
PARTY. 
DID YOU CONSUME ALCOHOL DURING 
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARS? 
>> YES. WE DRINK BEER. 
MY FRIENDS AND I, BOYS AND 
GIRLS, YES, WE DRINK BEER. 
I LIKE TO BEER. 
I STILL LIKE BEER. 
WE DRINK BEER. 
THE DRINKING AGE, AS I NOTED, 
WAS 18. 
SO THE SENIORS WERE LEGAL. 
WE WERE LEGAL TO DRINK. 
I SAID THAT SOMETIMES WE 
PROBABLY HAD TOO MANY BEERS AND 
SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE HAD TOO 
MANY BEERS. 
WE DRINK BEER. 
WE LIKE BEER. 
>> WHAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE TOO 
MANY BEERS? 
>> I DON'T KNOW. 
WHATEVER THE CHART SAYS. 
THE BLOOD-ALCOHOL CHART. 
>> WHEN YOU TALKED TO FOX NEWS 
THE OTHER NIGHT YOU SAID THAT 
THERE WERE TIMES IN HIGH SCHOOL 
WHEN PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE HAD TOO 
MANY BEERS ON OCCASION. 
DOES THAT INCLUDE YOU? 
>> SURE. 
>> HAVE YOU EVER PASSED OUT 
FROM DRINKING? 
>> PASSED OUT WOULD BE, NO. 
I'VE GONE TO SLEEP, BUT I HAVE 
NEVER BLACKED OUT. 
THAT IS THE ALLEGATION AND THAT 
IS WRONG. 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR TIME 
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
IN HIGH SCHOOL, AFTER DRINKING, 
DID YOU EVER WAKE UP IN A 
DIFFERENT LOCATION THAN YOU 
REMEMBERED PASSING OUT OR GOING 
TO SLEEP? 
>> NO. 
NO. 
>> DID YOU EVER WAKE UP WITH 
YOUR CLOSE IN A DIFFERENT 
CONDITION OR FEWER CLOTHES ON 
AND YOU REMEMBERED WHEN YOU 
WENT TO SLEEP OR PASSED OUT? 
>> NO. 
NO. 
>> DID YOU EVER -- DID ANYONE 
EVER TELL YOU ABOUT SOMETHING 
THAT HAPPENED IN YOUR PRESENCE 
THAT YOU DID NOT REMEMBER 
DURING A TIME THAT YOU HAD BEEN 
DRINKING? 
>> NO. 
WE DRINK BEER. 
AND SODA THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
PEOPLE OUR AGE AT THE TIME. 
IN ANY EVENT, WE DRANK BEER AND 
WE STILL DO. 
WHATEVER. 
>> DURING THE TIME IN HIGH 
SCHOOL WHEN YOU WOULD BE 
DRINKING, DID ANYONE EVER TELL 
YOU ABOUT SOMETHING THAT YOU 
DID NOT REMEMBER? 
>> NO. 
>> DR. FORD DESCRIBED A SMALL 
GATHERING OF PEOPLE AT A 
SUBURBAN MARYLAND HOME IN THE 
SUMMER OF 1982. 
SHE SAID THAT MARK JUDGE, PJ 
SMITH, AND LELAND INCOME WAS 
PRESENT, AS WELL AS AN UNKNOWN 
MALE. 
WERE YOU EVER AT A GATHERING 
THAT FITS THAT DESCRIPTION? 
>> KNOW, AS I SAID IN MY 
OPENING STATEMENTS. 
>> DR. FORD DESCRIBED AN 
INCIDENT WHERE SHE WAS ALONE IN 
A ROOM WITH YOU AND MARK JUDGE. 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ALONE IN A 
ROOM WITH MARK JUDGE? 
>> NO. 
>> HAVE YOU EVER GROUND OR 
RUBBED YOUR GENITALS AGAINST 
DR. FORD? 
DR. FORD DESCRIBED AN INCIDENT 
WHERE YOU COVERED HER MOUTH 
WITH YOUR HAND. 
HAVE YOU EVER COVERED DR. 
FORD'S MOUTH WITH YOUR HAND? 
>> NO. 
>> THEY DESCRIBED AN INCIDENT 
WHERE YOU EVER TRY TO REMOVE 
HER CLOSE. 
DID YOU EVER TRY TO REMOVE HER 
CLOTHES? 
>> NO. 
>> REFERRING BACK TO THE 
DEFINITION OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR 
THAT I HAVE GIVEN TO YOU, HAVE 
YOU EVER, AT ANY TIME, ENGAGED 
IN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR WITH DR. 
FORD? 
>> NO. 
>> HAVE YOU EVER ENGAGED IN 
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR WITH DR. FORD, 
EVEN IF IT WAS CONSENSUAL? 
>> NO. 
>> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUR 
CALENDARS. 
YOU SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE, 
COPIES OF THE HANDWRITTEN 
CALENDARS THAT YOU HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT FOR THE MONTHS OF MAY, 
JUNE, JULY, AND AUGUST OF 1982. 
TO HAVE THEM IN FRONT OF YOU? 
>> I DO. 
>> DID YOU CREATE THESE? 
>> IS IT YOUR HANDWRITING? 
>> YES. 
>> WHAT DID YOU MAKE THE 
ENTRIES? 
>> IN 1982. 
>> HAS ANYTHING CHANGED OR BEEN 
CHANGE FOR THOSE SINCE 1982? 
>> NO. 
>> DO THESE CALENDARS REPRESENT 
YOUR PLANS FOR EACH DAY, OR DO 
THEY DOCUMENT, PROSPECTIVELY, 
WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED MORE 
LIKE A DIARY? 
>> THEY ARE BOTH FORWARD-
LOOKING AND BACKWARD LOOKING, 
AS YOU CAN TELL FROM LOOKING AT 
THEM BECAUSE I CROSSED OUT 
CERTAIN DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS 
THAT DID NOT HAPPEN OR ONE 
NIGHT, WHEN I WAS SUPPOSED TO 
LIFT WEIGHTS, I CROSS THAT OUT 
BECAUSE I OBVIOUSLY DID NOT 
MAKE IT THAT NIGHT. 
YOU CAN SEE THINGS THAT I DID 
NOT DO. 
THEY WERE CROSSED OUT. 
AND ALSO, WHEN I LISTED 
SPECIFIC PEOPLE THAT I WAS WITH,
THAT IS LIKELY BACKWARD LOOKING.
>> YOU EXPLAIN THAT YOU KEPT 
THESE CALENDARS BECAUSE YOUR 
FATHER STARTED KEEPING THEM IN 
1978, I BELIEVE YOU SAID. 
THAT IS WHAT YOU KEPT THEM. 
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU WROTE ON 
THEM IN BUT WHY DID YOU KEEP 
THEM UP UNTIL THIS TIME? 
>> HE HAS KEPT THEM AS WELL 
SINCE 1978. 
HE IS A GOOD ROLE MODEL. 
>> MS. MITCHELL? 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS ASKED FOR A 
BREAK. 
WE WILL TAKE A 15 MINUTE BREAK. 
>> HELLO EVERYONE, WE JUST 
HEARD FROM A FIERY AND 
EMOTIONAL JUDGE WHO CAME, GUNS 
BLAZING, DEFIANT, TO THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, FOLLOWING 
ACCUSATIONS OF ASSAULT FROM DR. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.  
HERE TO DISCUSS WITH ME IS 
CAITLIN HUEY BURNS, LESLIE 
SANCHEZ, A REPUBLICAN 
STRATEGIST, AND JESSE WEBER, AN 
ATTORNEY AND HOST ON THE LAW 
AND CRIME NETWORK. 
THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. 
THAT WAS DIFFICULT TO LISTEN TO.
AT THE BEGINNING, HE WAS 
TEARFUL. 
HE WAS CLEARLY SHOOK UP. 
DEFIANT. 
UPSET. 
ANGRY. 
A RANGE OF EMOTIONS. 
TO THINK THAT HE HIT THE RIGHT 
NOTES? 
>> THERE IS A REASON THAT YOU 
NEVER WANT TO PUT A DEFENDANT 
ON THE STAND. 
THIS IS NOT A TRIAL. 
I WANT TO MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR. 
THIS IS NOT ABOUT GETTING TO 
THE TRUTH. 
THERE IS NOT A JURY HERE TO TRY 
TO GET TO SEE IF HE IS GUILTY 
OR NOT. 
THIS IS ABOUT HIS 
QUALIFICATIONS AND WHETHER NOT 
HE WILL BE NOMINATED. 
BUT WHEN HE FIRST CAME OUT, HE 
NEEDED TO NOT BE ROMANTIC, 
WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW IN THE 
PAST. 
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE VEERED A 
LITTLE BIT TO EMOTIONAL. 
AND A LITTLE BIT TOO OUT OF 
CONTROL. 
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
BEING VERY STRONG AND CREDIBLE, 
WHICH IS WHAT HE NEEDED TO BE. 
AND THERE WAS A STRONG 
PERFORMANCE BY DR. FORD THIS 
MORNING, AS OPPOSED TO LOOKING 
LIKE, HE IS GOING OVER THE EDGE 
A LITTLE BIT. 
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BETTER 
THING TO SAY IS, IF YOU WANT AN 
FBI INVESTIGATION, GO FOR. 
BUT IF YOU CLEAR MY NAME, YOU 
HAVE TO VOTE AND CONFIRM ME. 
>> DO YOU THINK HE HAD THE 
RIGHT NOTES OR DID HE GO TOO 
FAR? 
>> I THINK, REGARDLESS OF THIS, 
DOES A VERY PAINFUL PROCESS TO 
WATCH. 
IT IS VERY PERSONAL HERE. 
IT HAS ALSO BECOME HYPER- 
PARTISAN. IN THIS CASE, THE 
JUDGE BECAME HYPER- PARTISAN. 
IN TERMS OF HIS CONTRAST, HIS 
ATTITUDE. 
YOU CAN SEE THAT HE IS 
DEFENDING HIS NAME, HIS FAMILY, 
AND HIS HONOR, BUT THIS 
CONTENTIOUS BACK AND FORTH WITH 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN WILL WORK IN 
REPUBLICAN CIRCLES. 
THE PRAISING OF PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, THE ACTUALLY WORKS IF 
THE AUDIENCE IS AT 1600 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
>> THAT IS A GOOD POINT. 
HE THROUGHOUT THE WINDOW THE 
MYTH THAT THIS IS SUPPOSED BE A 
NONPARTISAN PROCESS. 
HE ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE A 
POLITICAL CANDIDATE AT SOME 
POINTS. 
HE CAME OUT SO HARD AGAINST THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
>> THAT IS WHAT IS LOST IN ALL 
OF THIS. 
WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT WHERE 
EVERYTHING BROKE DOWN, WE WILL 
SEE THIS PAGE IN HISTORY. 
IT IS CONTENTIOUS AND IT IS 
HIGHLY PARTISAN, AND IN MANY 
CASES, IT HAS BEEN VERY SEXIST, 
BUT IN THIS CASE, YOU SEE THE 
JUDGE HAVING TO GO THERE, NOT 
ONLY WITH THE BOXES INTERVIEW, 
BUT NOW THE GLOVES ARE OFF AND 
IT IS EXTREMELY PARTISAN AND HE 
IS TRIPPING. 
>> AND WE ALL LOST SOMETHING BY 
THAT, I THINK. 
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION? 
>> THIS IS A TOUGH DAY FOR 
EVERYBODY INVOLVED. 
THE TESTIMONY FROM DR. FORD WAS 
COMPELLING, GUT WRENCHING AT 
TIMES, AND ELICITING EMOTIONAL 
REACTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE 
WATCHING. 
THE JUDGE'S TESTIMONY, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH'S TESTIMONY, WHEN HE 
WAS GETTING EMOTIONAL, TALKING 
ABOUT HIS OWN FAMILY AND WHAT 
THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH 
THROUGHOUT THE 10 DAYS SINCE 
THE ALLEGATIONS SURFACED, WILL 
ALSO TUG AT -- EVOKES OF 
EMOTION FROM PEOPLE AS WELL. 
I AM WAITING TO SEE, THOUGH, 
HOW HE HANDLES THE QUESTIONING. 
MEMBER, THE DEMOCRATIC WAS 
SENATORS ARE NOT TO BE KIND TO 
HIM THE WAY THEY WANTED TO SHOW 
SUPPORT FOR DR. FORD AND FOR 
WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH. 
THEY ARE GOING TO GRILL JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH TO EVERY EXTENT THAT 
THEY CAN. 
WATCHING HOW HE RESPONDS TO 
THAT WILL BE REALLY TELLING. 
DID HE NEGATE ANY OF THIS OF 
THE THAT HE MAY HAVE GARNERED 
EARLIER IN THE TESTIMONY? 
WE ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER, AS 
LESLIE MEHTA, WHO HE IS TRYING 
TO TALK TO HERE. 
IS IT DONALD TRUMP? 
IS IT THE COLLINS AND 
MURKOWSKI'S OF THE SENATE. 
>> WE'RE GOING TO PLAY A LITTLE 
BIT OF SOME OF HIS MORE 
EMOTIONAL WORDS. 
I THINK WHERE HE WAS THE MOST 
TOUCHING WHEN HE SPOKE ABOUT 
HIS FAMILY. 
LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. 
>> I INTEND NO ILL WILL DR. 
FORD AND HER FAMILY. 
THE OTHER NIGHT, ASHLEY MY 
DAUGHTER SAID THEIR PRAYERS AND 
LITTLE LIZA, 10 YEARS OLD,, 
SAID TO ASHLEY, WE SHOULD PRAY 
FOR THE WOMAN. 
THERE'S A LOT OF WISDOM FROM A 
10-YEAR-OLD. 
WE MEAN NO ILL WILL. 
>> THAT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF 
THE MORE POIGNANT MOMENTS. 
YOU CERTAINLY CANNOT ARGUE WITH 
A 10-YEAR-OLD PRAYING FOR 
SOMEONE. 
I'M JUST CURIOUS, WHAT DO YOU 
THINK, A MAN CRYING IN PUBLIC 
IS HELD TO A DIFFERENT STANDARD 
THAN A WOMAN CRYING IN PUBLIC. 
DO YOU THINK, IN OTHER WORDS, 
THE HE WAS GIVEN POINTS FOR 
THAT SHOW OF EMOTION,'S, HAD 
DR. FORD, PERHAPS BROKEN DOWN 
ON THAT LEVEL, SHE MIGHT NOT 
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE SAME CREDIT?
WHAT YOU THINK? 
>> I THINK THAT SO MANY PEOPLE 
ARE TRYING TO MAKE HIM THE 
VILLAIN AND HE PUSHES BACK 
AGAINST THAT. 
HE SHOWED A VERY STRONG SENSE OF
HUMANITY. 
A STRONG SENSE OF HIS OWN 
PERSONAL FAITH AND COMPASSION. 
THAT EMPATHY FOR DR. FORD WILL 
CARRY A LOT OF WEIGHT. 
PEOPLE BE CONFUSED, AND HE 
CANNOT SAY 100% -- EITHER ONE 
OF THEM IS 100% CORRECT. 
THAT MAY BE FUNDAMENTALLY, IF 
THERE IS A WINNING, IN TERMS OF 
CONFIRMATION, THAT SALVAGES HIS 
NOMINATION. 
>> I THINK WE ARE IN A LOSE 
LOSE SITUATION. 
GUARD US OF HOW THIS TURNS OUT, 
THERE ARE SOME BROKEN LIVES. 
>> EXACTLY. 
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW 
ANYBODY COMES OUT OF THIS, 
WHETHER IT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
WINNING, MEANING HE IS NOMINATED
TO THE SUPREME COURT OR 
CONFIRMED TO THE SUPREME COURT, 
THIS WILL HAVE THEIR OVER COVER 
OVER HIM. 
THIS IS A HISTORIC DAY IN EVERY 
SENSE THE WORD. 
AND FOR DR. FORD, IT IS HARD TO 
SEE BOTH SIDES. 
IT IS HARD TO SEE WHERE THERE 
IS A VICTORY HERE, IF THAT IS A 
WORD THEY ARE USING. 
WHAT I AM ALSO GOING TO WATCH 
FOR IN THE COMING QUESTIONING, 
IS, HOW POLITICAL THIS DOES 
BECOME. 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A JUSTICE 
FOR THE SUPREME COURT OF THE 
UNITED STATES, WHICH WAS 
SUPPOSED TO BE REMOVED FROM 
POLITICS. 
THE JUDGE, IN HIS VERSACE WITH 
FOX NEWS EARLIER THIS WEEK, 
SAID HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE BAIT 
WHEN ASKED SEVERAL TIMES 
WHETHER THE MOTIVATIONS OF THIS 
WERE POLITICAL. 
HE DID NOT ENGAGE THEM THAT 
TODAY. 
IT DOES SEEM TO BE A PILLAR OF 
HIS DEFENSE, SAYING THAT IT WAS 
ABOUT THE PROCESS. 
HE IS SPEAKING TO PEOPLE IN THE 
AUDIENCE ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT 
TO GO AS A COUNTRY. 
FOR SOME PEOPLE, THAT MEANS 
LEAVING IN FORD. 
>> LET'S BRING IN BRIEFLY THE 
SOUND WHERE HE REFERENCED 
PRESIDENT TRUMP. 
>> THIS WHOLE TWO-WEEK EFFORT 
HAS BEEN A CALCULATED AND 
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT. 
FUELED WITH APPARENT PENT UP 
ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
THE ONLY 16 ELECTION. 
FEAR THAT HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY 
STOKED ABOUT MY JUDICIAL 
RECORD. 
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF THE 
CLINTONS. 
AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN 
MONEY FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING 
OPPOSITION GROUPS. 
>> THE GLOVES ARE OFF AND THE 
DEMOCRATS ARE THE ENERGY -- 
ENEMY. 
>> REPUBLICANS WOULD SAY, SEE 
SECRETLY SOME SORT OF GANG 
LEADER IN AN UNDERGROUND GANG 
RAPE GROUP THAT WAS AVOIDED 
THAT HE EVADED THE FBI? 
OR IS HE AND IS A MAN GOING 
THROUGH A SMEAR CAMPAIGN? 
THE ANSWER IS MORE LIKELY 
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. 
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO STEP 
BACK. 
IS THIS A BIG DEMOCRATIC PLOT 
TO UNEARTH THIS, OR IS IT 
SOMETHING WITH A HANDSOME 
INFORMATION, MAYBE SHOULD HAVE 
GIVEN IT FORWARD A LITTLE 
EARLIER, BUT GAVE IT. 
THE SAME POINT FOR THE 
REPUBLICANS. 
WE MIGHT WANT TO OPEN AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION, BUT BASED ON THE 
TIMING, MAYBE IT DOESN'T MAKE 
SO MUCH'S SENSE. 
WE CANNOT FIT WITH THE OVERALL 
THEME IS. 
THIS IS THE SUPREME COURT. 
IF THIS DOES NOT GET SETTLED BY 
OCTOBER 1, WE HAVE A SUPREME 
COURT THAT COULD THEORETICALLY 
GO IN WITH EIGHT JUSTICES AND 
BE SPLIT ON SOME MAJOR 
DECISIONS GOING FORWARD. 
A 4-4 SPLIT. 
IT MEANS THAT THE LOWER COURT 
DECISION WILL BE UPHELD. 
THAT IS A DANGEROUS THING TO 
THINK ABOUT. 
WE NEED NINE JUSTICES ON THE 
SUPREME COURT ONE WAY OR THE 
OTHER. 
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE 
HAVING THE CONVERSATION NOW, AS 
OPPOSED TO LATER, BUT YOU CAN'T 
HELP BUT THINK, THAT IF HE DOES 
NOT GET CONFIRMED, WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN, REALISTICALLY, MOVING 
FORWARD. 
WE HAVE SOME VERY IMPORTANT 
MONTHS HUMMING FORWARD. 
>> I HAVE A CBSN POLITICAL 
CONTRIBUTOR DEMOCRATIC 
STRATEGIST. LINDA, WHAT YOU 
MAKE OF THE OPENING STATEMENTS? 
>> I WOULD AGREE WITH A LOT OF 
WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT 
HERE JUST NOW ON THE PANEL. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SURPRISED US, I 
THINK, BY SHOWING A LEVEL OF 
EMOTION, THE INTENSITY AND THE 
DIRECT ATTACK ON DEMOCRATS. 
I WOULD SAY THAT SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT TRANSPIRED JUST 
NOW, I DON'T THINK THEY ARE 
TERRIBLY HELPFUL TO HIM AS HE 
WAS PLAYING TO THE AUDIENCE OF 
ONE OF DONALD TRUMP. 
I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT THE WOMEN 
WHO WERE WATCHING AT HOME, THAT 
THE FEMALE SENATORS WHO WILL 
ULTIMATELY VOTE ON WHETHER NOT 
TO CONFIRM HIM THOUGHT THAT IT 
WAS HELPFUL TO SEE HIS EXCHANGE 
WITH SENATOR FEINSTEIN. 
I THINK WHAT HAS BEEN LOST IN 
ALL OF THIS IS THAT, AT THE END 
OF THE DAY, THIS IS A JOB 
INTERVIEW. 
IT IS A JOB INTERVIEW THAT IS 
PLAYING OUT ON THE NATIONAL 
STAGE AND THE WORLD STAGE. 
BUT WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO, 
WHAT HE IS VYING FOR IS A JOB 
AS JUDGE FOR A LIFETIME ON THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
WHAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN 
DOING IS TRYING TO PRESENT A 
BALANCED SENSE. 
IF HE ENDS UP SEATED ON THE 
BENCH, AND THERE ARE 
PROGRESSIVE GROUPS THAT COME 
BEFORE HIM OR DEMOCRATIC CAUSES 
THAT COME BEFORE HIM, IT IS 
VERY CLEAR WHERE HE STANDS AND 
IT FEELS LIKE HE WILL BE 
HOLDING A GRUDGE. 
>> AT THIS POINT, WE KNOW WHERE 
HE STANDS WHEN IT COMES TO 
CERTAIN PARTISAN ISSUES, IF 
THERE WERE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
HOW HE WOULD VOTE ON SOME OF 
THE KEY CASES THAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT THAT WILL COME 
DOWN TO THE 5-4 SPLIT. 
>> THAT IS THE KEY THING. 
WITH A WHOLE DIFFERENT 
CONVERSATION WEEKS AGO WHEN IT 
WAS CONFIRMATION PROCESS. 
I'D THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE 
MIGHT'VE GONE ABOUT IT, BUT 
WHAT IT IS ABOUT IS HIS 
CREDIBILITY AND QUALIFICATIONS 
TO BE THE NEXT SUPREME COURT 
JUSTICE. 
IF THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE TRUE, 
IT IS THE RIGHT CONVERSATION TO 
HAVE. 
WHY SHOULD HE SIT ON THE COURT? 
BUT HE DOES MAKE A GREAT POINT. 
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS NOT A 
TRIAL, AND THERE IS NOTE JURY 
AND IT IS NOT ABOUT GUILT OR 
INNOCENCE, WE DO LIVE IN A LAND 
OF DUE PROCESS. 
YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO BOTH 
SIDES, ESPECIALLY ON THE SAME 
DAY. 
THERE IS SOMETHING LOST HERE 
WHEN IT IS JUST ONE PERSON 
SAYING ONE THING AND ONE PERSON 
SAYING ANOTHER. 
>> THIS IS NOT A TRIAL, IT IS 
-- AN APPOINTMENT TO A VERY 
IMPORTANT JOB. 
WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT HOW IF 
HE LOSES THE JOB, HE'S GOING TO 
JAIL. 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A POSITION 
ON THE SUPREME COURT FOR LIFE, 
FOR WHOM THERE MAY BE BETTER 
CANDIDATES OUT THERE. 
>> ONE THING THAT I WILL ADD IS 
THAT THERE IS A LOT MORE AT 
STAKE. 
HE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
WHAT HIS LIFE IS. 
HE SAID I MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO 
TEACH AGAIN OR COACH AGAIN. 
BUT IF HE GOES BACK TO THE D.C. 
CIRCUIT. 
THERE HAS BEEN TALK THAT IF HE 
HAS BEEN LYING UNDER OATH, 
COULD HE BE POSSIBLY GROUNDS 
FOR IMPEACHMENT? 
THAT IS WAY TOO EARLY TO SAY, 
BUT IT IS A CONVERSATION PEOPLE 
ARE HAVING. 
>> YOU WOULD NEED AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION FOR THAT. 
>> THAT IS WHAT IT'S GOING FOR. 
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THIS JOB, 
IT'S THE OTHER ASPECTS OF HIS 
LIFE. 
IT IS THE BIGGEST JOB INTERVIEW 
OF HIS LIFE, BUT IT TOUCHES 
OTHER ASPECTS THAT HE NEVER 
IMAGINED HE ACCEPTED, YES, YOU 
CAN NOMINATE ME FOR THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
>> THAT IS THE SEVERITY OF IT. 
IT FEELS LIKE GUILTY UNTIL 
PROVEN INNOCENT. 
HE IS TO GO THROUGH AND SAY NO. 
HE WAS SHOWING CALENDARS AND 
SAYING I HAVE VERY GOOD 
DOCUMENTATION. 
IF THIS WAS A COURT CASE, YOU'D 
BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THAT AND 
IT WOULD BE A MUCH BETTER 
INFORMATION. 
IT IS THE ABILITY TO COACH AND 
TEACH, AND OTHER THINGS. 
>> WE WILL SEE THAT MARK JUDGE 
HAS WRITTEN A BOOK THAT MAY 
PLACE HIM IN THE AREA, SO THERE 
ARE OTHER STORIES OUT THERE 
THAT COULD GET CLEARED UP IF HE 
CAME IN TO TESTIFY, OR IF THERE 
WAS AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
>> THAT IS WHY WE COME BACK TO 
SAY THERE IS NO REAL WINNER. 
WE PUSH THIS THROUGH. 
IF THEY RUSH IT THROUGH. 
THEY HAVE THE VOTE. 
IF HE DOES GET SEATED, THERE 
WILL STILL BE RAMIFICATIONS FOR 
THAT, BECAUSE THE LENS, AS ANY 
HUMAN, HE WILL SEE THINGS. 
PART OF THE LAST TESTIMONY 
SAYING THAT THE HOURS OF 
TESTIMONIES, I DON'T HAVE A 
PERSONAL AX TO GRIND. 
HOW CAN YOU REALISTICALLY SAY 
THAT AND JUST TURN THE PAGE, 
WHEN AMERICA HAS NOT TURNED THE 
PAGE. 
>> TO THAT NOTE, THIS OPENS UP 
SO MANY OTHER LAYERS NOW. 
FOR SENATORS TO DECIDE WHETHER 
TO CONFIRM HIM. 
IT IS NOT JUST WHETHER YOU 
BELIEVE THESE ALLEGATIONS, IT 
IS WHETHER YOU BELIEVE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH IS NOT TOO PARTISAN 
FOR THE COURT. 
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT HE HAS THE 
CREDIBILITY TO STAND ON THE 
COURT. 
THERE SO MANY LAYERS NOW THAT 
HAVE OPENED UP. 
WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE 
HIM TALK ABOUT TRYING TO APPEAL 
TO SAY, IMAGINE YOUR HUSBAND, 
YOUR SON, KIND OF FLIP THE 
VICTIM CARD ON ITS HEAD WHEN 
PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH 
THIS, SAY THINK ABOUT YOUR 
MOTHER OR YOUR SISTER, OR WOMEN 
IN YOUR LIFE. 
HE IS TRYING TO FLIP THAT ON 
ITS HEAD. 
WE WILL SEE. 
>> THAT WAS ONE OF THE 
STRONGEST PARTS OF WHAT HE WAS 
SAYING, WE SHOW THE PERSONAL 
NATURE OF HOW ALL OF THIS HAS 
HAD ON HIS LIFE. 
I THINK HE CAME ACROSS LESS 
COMPELLING WHEN SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN WAS INTERVIEWING HIM. 
HE WAS COMBATIVE AND VERGING ON 
DISRESPECTFUL. 
IT WILL BE INTERESTING GOING 
FORWARD TO SEE IF HE CHALLENGE 
-- CHANNELS THE ANGER IN AN 
APPROPRIATE WAY OR OR, IF WHEN 
SPEAKING TO FEMALE SENATORS, 
THE OPTICS CHANGE. 
HIS TONE. 
IS ROLLING HIS EYES. 
I THINK ANYBODY IN THAT 
SITUATION, IT IS SO 
EXTRAORDINARY. 
WE CANNOT PUT ENOUGH OF A POINT 
ON THAT. 
HOW EXTRAORDINARY IT IS. 
SO PERSONAL. 
SUCH STRANGE THINGS WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT. 
AND THE SENATORS, ESPECIALLY 
THE REPUBLICAN WHAT ON THE 
RIGHT, COULD YOU SOME 
SENSITIVITY TRAINING. 
THE BREAK THAT WE HAD, EVERY 
MAJOR CORPORATION HAS SOME SORT 
OF, LET'S GET WITH THE MODERN 
CENTURY. 
BUT I FEEL LIKE WHEN WE LISTEN 
TO THE SENATORS, WE'RE BACK IN 
THE 1800S. 
IT WOULD BEHOOVE US TO LEARN 
HOW TO COMMUNICATE. 
>> IT'S A NEXT ORDINARY 
AFTERNOON, BECAUSE WE LISTENING 
TO TWO PEOPLE WHO SEEM TO 
GENUINELY BELIEVE THERE STORIES 
100%. 
>> AND LET EVERYBODY STEP BACK 
AND IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE EITHER 
BRETT KAVANAUGH OR DR. FORD. 
FROM A REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE, 
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ACT UP 
THERE? 
YOU'RE GOING TO ACT THE WAY 
THAT HE IS ACTING, OR IF YOU 
THINK ABOUT HOW DR. FORD WAS 
ABLE TO GET THE STORY FORWARD 
AND PEOPLE WORSE OPTICAL OF 
THAT, SHE SPOKE TO HER FRIENDS 
OF THE BEACH AND HAD NO IDEA ON 
HOW TO GET THE LEGAL PROCESS 
GOING. 
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SOMEONE IN 
THAT POSITION WOULD DO. 
>> I'M GOING TO POINT OUT THAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS SAT BACK 
DOWN. 
THE QUESTION WILL RESUME. 
SO LET'S LISTEN IN. 
>> SENATOR LEAHY.  
>> JUDGE, YOU SAID BEFORE, THAT 
MARK JUDGE WAS A CLOSE FRIEND 
OF YOURS IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
NOW, DR. FORD, AS YOU KNOW, HAS 
SAID THAT HE WAS IN THE ROOM 
WHEN SHE WAS ATTACKED. 
SHE ALSO SAID THAT YOU ARE AS 
WELL. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THE FBI HAS 
NEVER INTERVIEWED HIM. 
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HAVE 
HIS ATTENDANCE HERE. 
THE CHAIRMAN REFUSES TO CALL 
HIM. 
IF SHE SAYING THAT MARK JUDGE 
WAS IN THE ROOM THEN, HE SHOULD 
BE IN THE ROOM HERE TODAY. 
WOULD YOU WANT HIM CALLED AS A 
WITNESS? 
>> SENATOR, THIS ALLEGATION 
CAME INTO THE COMMITTEE? 
>> I'M JUST ASKING THE 
QUESTION. 
WOULD LIKE HIM TO BE AS A 
WITNESS? 
>> HE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED 
SWORN TESTIMONY. 
>> IT HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED 
BY THE FBI. 
THE COMMITTEE HAS REFUSED TO 
ALLOW TO BE. 
>> IT WAS DROPPED ON ME. 
WAS FROM. 
>> IT WAS CONFISCATED BY THE 
FBI. 
IT HAS NOT BEEN CALLED. 
>> IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPENED 
IN DUE COURSE, SENATOR. 
WHEN IT CAME IN. 
>> I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT. 
I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR 
44 YEARS. 
WITH BOTH PUBLICANS AND GRASS. 
NEVER SEEN ANYONE THAT CRITICAL 
AND NOT ALLOW THEM TO BE CALLED 
 
MONEY. 
>> HE HAS PROVIDED SWORN 
TESTIMONY. 
THE ALLEGATION CAME IN WEEKS 
AGO. 
NOTHING WAS DONE WITH IT I THE 
RANKING MEMBER. 
THAN IT WAS FROM ON ME. 
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, I HAVE 
HEARD YOUR LINE AND YOU HAVE 
STATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. 
BUT LET ME ASK YOU THIS, HE 
AUTHORED A BOOK TITLED "WASTED, 
TALES OF A X DRUNK." 
HE MENTIONS SOMEONE NAMED 
KAVANAUGH. 
IS THAT YOU HE IS TALKING 
ABOUT? 
>>  SENATOR, MARK JUDGE -- 
>> IS THAT YOU THAT HE WAS 
TALKING ABOUT? 
>> IF YOU WILL LET ME PROCEED. 
MARK JUDGE WAS A FRIEND OF OURS 
IN HIGH SCHOOL. 
HE DEVELOPED A VERY SERIOUS 
TRICKING PROBLEM. 
AN ADDICTION PROBLEM. 
IT LASTED DECADES AND WAS VERY 
DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO ESCAPE 
FROM. 
HE NEARLY DIED. 
THEN HE HAD LEUKEMIA AS WELL ON 
TOP OF THAT. 
NOW, AS PART OF HIS THERAPY AND 
PART OF HIS COMING TO GRIPS 
WITH SOBRIETY, HE WROTE A BOOK. 
IT IS A FICTIONALIZED BOOK AND 
AN ACCOUNT. I THINK YOU PICKED 
OUT NAMES OF FRIENDS OF OURS TO 
THROW THE MEN AS CLOSE TO FOUR 
CHARACTERS IN THE GROUP BOOK. 
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT 
IS YOU ARE NOT. 
>> WE CAN SAY THERE AND MAKE 
FUN OF SOME GUY WHO HAS AN 
ADDICTION, BUT I DON'T THINK 
THAT MAKES -- 
>> I'M TRYING TO GET A STRAIGHT 
ANSWER FROM YOU UNDER OATH. 
ARE YOU THE BARGE KAVANAUGH 
THAT YOU ARE REFERRING TO . 
>> YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM. 
>> I AGREE WITH YOU THERE. 
THAT'S WHY WAS THE CHAIRMAN HAD 
HIM HERE UNDER OATH. 
YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR YEARBOOK. 
IN YOUR YEARBOOK, YOU TALKED 
ABOUT DRINKING AND SEXUAL 
EXPLOITS, DID YOU NOT? 
>> SENATOR, LET ME TAKE A STEP 
BACK AND EXPLAIN HIGH SCHOOL. 
I WAS NUMBER 1 IN THE CLASS. 
>> THAT IS OTHER. 
>> NO. 
I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY HIGH 
SCHOOL. 
NO! 
>> LET HIM ANSWER. 
>> I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT MY 
HIGH SCHOOL RECORD IF YOU'RE 
GOING TO MOCK ME. 
>> I THINK WE WERE ARE -- ALL 
VERY GENEROUS WITH DOCTOR FOR. 
>> I BUSTED MY BUTT WITH 
ACADEMICS. 
I FINISHED NUMBER 1 IN THE 
CLASS. 
FRESHMAN AND JUNIOR YEAR, I WAS 
ALWAYS UP AT THE TOP. 
I PLAYED SPORTS. 
I WAS CAPTAIN OF THE VARSITY 
BASKETBALL TEAM. 
I WAS WIDE RECEIVER AND 
DEFENSIVE BACK ON THE FOOTBALL 
TEAM. 
I RAN TRACK IN THE SPRING OF 82 
TO GET FASTER. 
I DID MY SERVICE PROJECTS AT 
THE SCHOOL. 
IT INVOLVES GOING TO THE SOUP 
KITCHEN DOWNTOWN. 
LET ME FINISH. 
AND GOING TO TUTOR 
INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED KIDS AT 
THE ROCKVILLE LIBRARY. 
WITH THE CHURCH. 
YES, WE GOT TOGETHER WITH OUR 
FRIENDS. 
>> DOES THIS REFLECT WHO YOU 
ARE? 
DOES THIS YEARBOOK REFLECT YOUR 
FOCUS ON ACADEMICS AND RESPECT 
FOR WOMEN? 
THIS IS EASY. 
YES OR NO. 
DOES THIS REFLECT YOUR FOCUS? 
>> ALREADY SAID IN MY OPENING 
STATEMENT. 
>> WAIT A MINUTE. 
HE HAS ASKED THE QUESTION, I 
WILL GIVE YOU TIME TO ANSWER. 
>> YEARBOOK, AS I SAID IN MY 
OPENING STATEMENT, WAS 
SOMETHING WHERE THE STUDENTS 
AND EDITORS MADE A DECISION TO 
TREAT SOME OF IT AS FAR AS AND 
SOME OF IT AS EXAGGERATION, 
SOME OF THE CELEBRATING THINGS 
THAT DO NOT REFLECT THE CENTRAL 
PART OF OUR SCHOOL. 
YES, WE WENT TO PARTIES. 
OF COURSE, WE WENT TO PARTIES. 
THE YEARBOOK PAGE DESCRIBES 
THAT AND MAKES FUN OF IT. 
IF WE WANTED TO SIT HERE AND 
TALK ABOUT WHETHER A SUPREME 
COURT NOMINATION SHOULD BE 
BASED ON A HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK 
PAGE, THAT IS TAKING US TO A 
NEW LEVEL OF ABSURDITY. 
>> SO MS. MITCHELL, WE HAVE A 
FILIBUSTER GOING ON WITH A 
SINGLE ANSWER. 
>> MS. MITCHELL. 
>> JUDGE, DO YOU STILL HAVE 
YOUR CALENDAR THERE? 
>> I DO. 
>> I WOULD LIKE YOU TO LOOK AT 
THE JULY 1 ENTRY. 
>> YES. 
>> THE ENTRY SAYS, AND I QUOTE, 
"GO TO TIMMY'S WITH SKIS." TO 
WHAT DOES THIS REFER, AND TO 
WHOM? 
>> FIRST, IT SAYS TOBIN'S HOUSE 
WORK OUT, SO THAT IS ONE OF THE 
FOOTBALL WORKOUTS THAT WE WOULD 
HAVE. 
IT WAS FOR GUYS IN THE FOOTBALL 
TEAM. 
SO WE WOULD BE THERE. 
THAT IS USUALLY FROM 6:00 UNTIL 
8:00 OR SO, TELL ME YOUR -- 
UNTIL NEAR DARK. 
THE WE WOULD GO TO TIMMY'S. 
DO WANT TO KNOW THE LAST NAMES? 
I'M HAPPY TO DO IT. 
>> IF YOU COULD JUST IDENTIFY, 
IS JUDGE MARK JUDGE? 
>> IT IS. 
>> AND HIS PJ PJ SMITH? 
>> IT IS TIM, TOM KANE, BERNIE 
McCARTHY, CHRIS GARRETT. 
>> CHRIS GARRETT IS KLOBUCHAR? 
>> YES. 
>> DID YOU  FREQUENTLY DOCUMENT 
IN YOUR CALENDAR, HOUSE PARTIES 
OR PARTIES WITH FRIENDS IN YOUR 
CALENDAR? 
>> IT APPEARS THAT WAY. 
THAT IS WHAT I WAS DOING IN THE 
SUMMER OF 1982. 
YOU CAN SEE THIS REFLECTED ON 
SEVERAL OF THE ENTRIES. 
>> IF A GATHERING LIKE DR. FORD 
HAS DESCRIBED HAD OCCURRED, 
WOULD YOU HAVE DOCUMENTED THAT? 
>> YES. 
I DOCUMENTED EVERYTHING. THOSE 
KINDS OF EVENTS, EVEN SMALL GET-
TOGETHERS. AUGUST 7 IS ANOTHER 
GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHERE I 
DOCUMENTED A SMALL GET TOGETHER 
THAT SUMMER. 
SO YES. 
>> AUGUST 7, COULD YOU READ 
THAT? 
>> IT SAYS GO TO BECKY'S. MATT, 
DENISE, LAURIE, JENNY. 
>> HAVE YOU REVIEWED EVERY 
ENTRY THAT IS IN THESE CALENDARS
OF MAY, JUNE, JULY, AND AUGUST 
1982. 
>> I HAVE. 
>> IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD 
EVEN REMOTELY FIT WHAT WE ARE 
TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF DR. 
FORD'S ALLEGATIONS? 
>> NO. 
>> AS A LAWYER AND A JUDGE, 
ARGUE -- WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT 
THE FBI. 
ARE YOU AWARE THAT THIS TYPE OF 
OFFENSE WOULD ACTUALLY BE 
INVESTIGATED BY LOCAL POLICE? 
>> YES. 
I MENTIONED MONTGOMERY COUNTY 
POLICE EARLIER. 
>> ARE YOU AWARE THAT IN 
MARYLAND, THERE IS NO STATUTE 
OF LIMITATIONS THAT WOULD 
PROHIBIT YOU BEING CHARGED, 
EVEN IF THIS HAPPENED IN 1982? 
>> THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. 
>> HAVE YOU, AT ANY TIME, BEEN 
CONTACTED BY ANY MEMBERS OF 
LOCAL POLICE AGENCIES REGARDING 
THIS MATTER? 
>> NO. 
>> PRIOR TO YOUR NOMINATION FOR 
SUPREME COURT, YOU TALKED ABOUT 
ALL OF THE FEMALE CLERKS THAT 
YOU HAVE HAD AND THE THAT YOU 
HAVE WORKED WITH. 
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT 
THEM. 
I'M TALKING ABOUT GLOBALLY. 
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ACCUSED, 
EITHER FORMALLY OR INFORMALLY OF
UNWANTED SEXUAL BEHAVIOR? 
>> NO. 
>> WHEN I SAY INFORMALLY, I 
MEAN A FEMALE COMPLAINT. 
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TO ANYBODY 
ELSE BUT YOU. 
>> NO. 
>> SINCE DR. FORD'S ALLEGATION 
WAS MADE PUBLIC, HOW MANY TIMES 
HAVE YOU BEEN INTERVIEWED BY 
THE COMMITTEE? 
>> IT HAS BEEN THREE OR FOUR. 
I AM TRYING TO REMEMBER NOW. 
IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL TIMES. 
EACH OF THESE NEW THINGS, AS 
ABSURD AS THEY ARE, WE WOULD GO 
ON THE PHONE TO GO THROUGH 
THEM. 
>> SO HAVE YOU SUBMITTED TWO 
INTERVIEWS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT 
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATION? 
>> WHAT ABOUT DEBORAH RAMIREZ IS
ALLEGATION? 
HOW ABOUT MS. SWETNICK'S  
ALLEGATION ABOUT DRUGGING AND 
RAPING OR ALLOWING WOMEN TO BE 
GANG RAPED? 
>> YES. 
I HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED ABOUT 
IT. 
>> WERE YOUR ANSWERS TO MY 
QUESTIONS TODAY CONSISTENT WITH 
THE ANSWERS THAT YOU GAVE TO 
THE COMMITTEE IN THESE VARIOUS 
INTERVIEWS? 
>> YES. 
>> 
>> SENATOR DURBIN, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, DOCTOR CHRISTINE FORD
WAS IN THE SAME CHAIR. 
SHE SAID CLEARLY AND 
UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT SHE WAS OF 
THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AT 
YOUR HANDS. 
SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS 
DIRECTLY INTO NOT FLINCH AT THE 
IDEA OF SO MANY HERSELF TO AN 
FBI INVESTIGATION OF THE 
CHARGES. 
WE KNOW, AND I'M SURE SHE HAS 
BEEN ADVISED BY HER ATTORNEYS, 
THAT A PERSON LYING TO THE FBI 
CAN FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. 
YOU HAVE CLEARLY AND 
UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED THE YOU 
ASSAULTED DR. FORD. 
WITH THAT STATEMENT, YOU MUST 
BELIEVE, THAT THERE IS NO 
CREDIBLE EVIDENCE OR ANY 
CREDIBLE WITNESS THAT CAN PROVE 
OTHERWISE. 
YOU STARTED OFF WITH AN 
IMPASSIONED STATEMENT AT THE 
BEGINNING. 
I CAN IMAGINE, TRY TO IMAGINE, 
WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND 
YOUR FAMILY HAS BEEN THROUGH. 
I'M SURE WOULD NOT GET CLOSE TO 
IT. 
>> YOU WOULD NOT. 
>> I'M SURE I WOULD NOT. 
IN THE COURSE OF IT, HE SAID, I 
WELCOME ANY KIND OF 
INVESTIGATION. 
I QUOTE YOU. 
I WELCOME ANY KIND OF 
INVESTIGATION. 
I HAVE A SUGGESTION FOR YOU. 
RIGHT NOW. 
TURN TO YOUR LEFT AND THE FRONT 
ROW, TO DON McGAHN, COUNSEL TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP, ASK HIM TO 
SUSPEND THE HEARING AND 
NOMINATION PROCESS UNTIL THE 
FBI COMPLETES ITS INVESTIGATION 
OF THE CHARGES MADE BY DR. FORD 
AND OTHERS AND GO TO BRING THE 
WITNESSES FORWARD AND PROVIDE 
THE INFORMATION TO THE HEARING. 
I AM SURE THAT THE CHAIRMAN AT 
THAT POINT, WILL UNDERSTAND 
THAT THAT IS A REASONABLE 
REQUEST. TO FINALLY PUT TO REST 
THESE CHARGES, IF THEY ARE 
FALSE, OR TO PROVE THEM IF THEY 
ARE NOT. 
YOU SPENT 2 YEARS IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE OFFICE THAT APPROVED 
JUDICIAL NOMINEES. 
YOU TURNED TO THE FBI OVER AND 
OVER AND OVER AGAIN FOR THEIR 
WORK. 
LET'S BRING THEM IN HERE AND 
NOW. 
TURNED TO DON McGAHN AND TELL 
HIM, IT IS TIME TO GET THIS 
DONE. 
IN FBI INVESTIGATION IS THE 
ONLY WAY TO ANSWER SOME OF 
THESE QUESTIONS. 
>> STOP THE CLOCK. 
THIS COMMITTEE IS RUNNING THIS 
HEARING. 
NOT THE WHITE HOUSE, NOT DON 
McGAHN, NOT EVEN YOU AS THE 
NOMINEE. 
WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE DR. 
FORD ASKED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY 
HERE. 
I KNOW YOU DID AS WELL. 
EFFECT, MAYBE EVEN BEFORE SHE 
DID. 
WE ARE HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE 
WANTED TO BE HEARD FROM CHARGES 
THAT THEY ALL THOUGHT WERE 
UNFAIR. 
OR ACTIVITIES, LIKE SEXUAL 
ASSAULT, WAS UNFAIR. 
SO I WANT TO ASSURE SENATOR 
DURBIN, REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU 
SAY TO SENATOR DON McGAHN, 
WE'RE NOT SUSPENDING THIS 
HEARING. 
PROCEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
>> I WILL JUST SAY THIS. 
IF YOU, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, TURNED 
TO DON McGAHN AND TO THE 
COMMITTEE AND SAY, FOR THE SAKE 
OF MY REPUTATION, MY FAMILY 
NAME, AND TO GET TO THE BOTTOM 
OF THE TRUTH OF THIS, I'M NOT 
GOING TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO AN 
FBI INVESTIGATION. 
I WOULD HOPE THAT ALL MEMBERS 
OF THE COMMITTEE WOULD JOIN ME 
IN SAYING THAT WE WOULD ABIDE 
BY YOUR WISHES AND HAVE THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> I WELCOME WHATEVER THE 
COMMITTEE WANTS TO DO. 
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. 
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING. 
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT 
TO DO. 
>> I AM INNOCENT. 
I'M INNOCENT OF THE CHARGE. 
>> YOU WANT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION? 
>> THEY DON'T COME TO 
CONCLUSIONS. 
>> YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH 
WAYS. 
YOU CANNOT SAY IT THE BEGINNING 
SAY THAT YOU WELCOME ANY KIND OF
INVESTIGATION. 
>> THIS THING WAS SPRUNG ON ME. 
IT WAS FUN AT THE LAST MINUTE 
AFTER BEING HELD BY STAFF. 
YOU KNOW. 
I CALLED FOR HEARING 
IMMEDIATELY. 
>> IF THERE IS NO TRUTH TO HER 
CHARGES, THE FBI INVESTIGATION 
WILL SHOW THAT. 
ARE YOU AFRAID THAT THEY MIGHT 
NOT? 
>> COME ON. 
>> THE FBI DOES NOT REACH 
CONCLUSIONS. 
YOU KNOW THAT. 
YOU KNOW THAT IS A PHONY 
QUESTION. 
THE FBI DOES NOT REACH 
CONCLUSIONS, THE JUST PROVIDE A 
302. 
SOMETIMES WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO 
DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT IS, THEY 
JUST GO AND DO WHAT YOU ARE 
DOING. 
ASKED QUESTIONS AND THEN TYPE 
UP A REPORT. 
THEY DO NOT REACH THE BOTTOM 
LINE. 
>> I ASKED DR. FORD, ASKED 
ABOUT THIS INCIDENT WHERE SHE 
RAN INTO MARK JUDGE AT SAFEWAY. 
SHE SAID, SURE, I REMEMBER. 
IT WAS SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AFTER 
THE OCCURRENCE. 
SOMEONE AT THE WASHINGTON POST 
TOOK A LOOK AT HIS BOOK AND WAS 
ABLE TO SELECT WHAT HE WROTE 
ABOUT HIS ADDICTION AND 
ALCOHOLISM. 
THEY'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO 
WHAT THEY THINK IS A PERIOD OF 
TIME. 
SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AFTER THE 
EVENT. 
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORKING AT 
THE SAFEWAY AT THAT POINT. 
THE POINT I'M GETTING TO, IS 
THAT WE CAN CONNECT SOME DOTS 
HERE AND GET SOME INFORMATION. 
WHY WOULD YOU RESIST THAT KIND 
OF INVESTIGATION? 
>> DOTS. 
>> WHY WOULD YOU RESIST THE 
KIND OF INVESTIGATION? 
>> I WANTED THE HEARING LAST 
WEEK. 
>> I'M ASKING ABOUT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> THE COMMITTEE FIGURES OUT 
HOW TO ASK THE QUESTIONS. 
I'LL DO WHATEVER. 
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE WITH 
COMMITTEE COUNSEL. 
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, WILL YOU 
SUPPORT AN FBI INVESTIGATION 
RIGHT NOW? 
>> I WILL DO WHATEVER THE 
COMMITTEE WANTS. 
>> PERSONALLY, DO YOU THINK 
THAT IS THE BEST THING FOR US 
TO DO? 
DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER? 
>> LOOK, SENATOR. 
I HAVE SAID THAT I WANT TO THE 
HEARING. 
I SAID THAT I WAS WELCOMING 
ANYTHING. 
I AM INNOCENT. 
THIS THING WAS HELD. IT WAS 
HELD WHEN IT COULD HAVE BEEN 
PRESENTED IN AN ORDINARY WAY. 
IT COULD HAVE BEEN HELD AND 
HANDLED CONFIDENTIALITY AT 
FIRST. 
WHICH IS WHAT DR. FORD'S WISHES 
WERE, AS I UNDERSTOOD IT. 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED MY 
FAMILY LIKE THIS EFFORT HAS. 
>> I THINK IN FBI INVESTIGATION 
WILL HELP ALL OF US ON BOTH 
SIDES OF THE ISSUE. 
>> SENATOR GRAHAM ASKS FOR THE 
FLOOR. 
BEFORE HE DOES, IT SEEMS TO ME 
THAT IF YOU WANT TO KNOW 
SOMETHING, YOU HAVE THE WITNESS 
RIGHT HERE TO ASK HIM AND 
SECONDLY, IF YOU WANT IN FBI 
REPORTS, YOU CAN ASK FOR IT 
YOURSELF. 
I HAVE ASKED FOR FBI REPORTS IN 
THE PAST. 
IN THE 38 YEARS THAT I HAVE 
BEEN IN THE SENATE. 
>> ARE YOU AWARE THAT AT 9:23 
ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 9, THE DAY 
YOU WERE NOMINATED TO THE 
SUPREME COURT, BY PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, SENATOR SCHUMER SAID, 23 
MINUTES AFTER NOMINATION, I 
WILL OPPOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
NOMINATION WITH EVERYTHING I 
HAVE. 
I HAVE A -- I HOPE A BIPARTISAN 
GEORDIE WILL DO THE SAME. 
THE STAKES ARE SIMPLY TOO HIGH 
FOR ANYTHING LESS. 
IF YOU ARE NOT AWARE, YOU ARE 
NOW. 
DID YOU MEET WITH SENATOR 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN ON AUGUST 20? 
>> DID YOU KNOW THAT HER STAFF 
HAD ALREADY RECOMMENDED A 
LAWYER TO DR. FORD? 
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT. 
>> DID YOU KNOW THAT HER AND 
HER STAFF HAD THESE ALLEGATIONS 
FOR OVER 20 DAYS? 
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT AT THE 
TIME. 
>> IF YOU WANTED IN FBI 
INVESTIGATION, YOU COULD HAVE 
COME TO US. 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY 
THIS GUYS LIFE, HOLD THE SEAT 
OPEN, AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020. 
YOU SAID THAT. 
NOT ME. 
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE 
FOR. 
WHEN YOU SEE THEM SAYING THAT 
LINDSAY SAID THIS. 
I VOTED FOR THEM. 
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT 
YOU HAVE DONE TO THE SKY. 
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL, SHAM
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS. 
IF YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW 
THE TRUTH, YOU SURE WOULD NOT 
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU HAVE DONE 
THIS GUY. 
YOU A GANG RAPIST? 
>> NO. 
>> I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU 
AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE 
THROUGH. 
YOU WANT POWER. 
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET A. OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN SEE THROUGH 
THIS SHAM. 
THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU 
HELD IT. 
YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF 
PROTECTING DR. FORD. 
NONE. 
SHE IS AS MUCH OF A VICTIM AS 
YOU ARE. 
I HATE TO SAY IT, BECAUSE THESE 
HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS. 
BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHEN IT 
COMES TO THIS, YOU ARE LOOKING 
FOR A FAIR PROCESS. YOU CAME TO 
THE WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG 
TIME, MY FRIEND. 
YOU CONSIDER THIS A JOB 
INTERVIEW? 
>> THE ADVICE AND CONSENT RULE 
IS. 
>> YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU HAVE 
BEEN THROUGH A JOB INTERVIEW? 
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH A PROCESS 
OF ADVICE AND CONSENT UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
>> WOULD YOU SAY YOU HAVE BEEN 
THROUGH 
>> I HAVE BEEN THROUGH AND THEN 
SOME. 
>> THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW. 
THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY
THE ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO 
COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS 
CRAP. 
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK. 
YOU HAVE INTERACTED WITH 
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ALL YOUR 
LIFE. 
NOT ONE ACCUSATION. 
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE BILL SCOTT
-- BILL COSBY WOULD YOUR JUNIOR 
AND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL. 
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU GOT OVER 
IT. 
IT HAS BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING 
THAT IF YOU DRUG WOMEN AND RAPE 
THEM FOR 2 YEARS IN HIGH 
SCHOOL, YOU PROBABLY DON'T 
STOP. 
HERE IS MY UNDERSTANDING. 
IF YOU HAVE LIVED A GOOD LIFE, 
PEOPLE WILL RECOGNIZE IT. 
BUT THE AMERICAN BAR 
ASSOCIATION HAS AS THE GOLD 
STANDARD.
'S INTEGRITY IS ABSOLUTELY 
UNQUESTIONED. 
HE IS THE VERY CIRCUMSPECT IN 
HIS PERSONAL CONDUCT. HE 
HARBORS NO BIASES OR RIGID IS 
HIS. 
HE IS ENTIRELY ETHICAL. 
IS A REALLY DECENT PERSON. 
HE IS WARM, FRIENDLY, 
UNASSUMING. 
HE IS THE NICEST PERSON. 
THAT IS FROM THE ABA. 
ONE THING I SHOULD TELL YOU YOU 
SHOULD BE PROUD OF. 
YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF THIS. 
YOU RAISED A DAUGHTER WHO HAD 
THE GOOD CHARACTER TO PRAY FOR 
DR. FORD. 
TO MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES, IF 
YOU VOTE NO. 
YOU ARE LEGITIMIZING THE MOST 
DESPICABLE THING I HAVE SEEN IN 
MY TIME IN POLITICS. 
YOU WANT THE SEAT? 
I HOPE YOU NEVER GET IT. 
I HOPE YOU ARE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE HE SHOULD 
BE. 
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL 
SEE THROUGH THIS CHARADE. 
I INTEND TO VOTE FOR YOU AND I 
HOPE EVERYONE WHO IS FAIR-
MINDED WILL. 
>> SENATOR WHITE HOUSE. 
-- WHITEHOUSE. 
>> DO THAT WE SHOULD LET THINGS 
SETTLE A LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT? 
>> WE COULD TAKE A 62nd BREAK. 
>> I AM GOOD. 
>> ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE 
ARE LOOKING AT THE YEARBOOK IS 
THAT IT IS RELATIVELY 
CONSISTENT IN TIME WITH THE 
EVENTS AT ISSUE HERE AND, 
BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO BE YOUR 
WORDS. 
IS IT, IN FACT, YOUR WORDS ON 
YOUR YEARBOOK PAGE? 
>> WE SUBMITTED THINGS TO THE 
EDITORS AND I BELIEVE THEY TOOK 
THEM. 
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY CHANGED 
THINGS ARE NOT. 
>> YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY 
CHANGES? 
>> I AM NOT AWARE OF ONE WHERE 
THE OTHER. 
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT HERE AND 
CONTEST THAT. 
HAVE ADDED IF YOU WANT TO GO 
THROUGH MY YEARBOOK. 
>> I'M ACTUALLY INTERESTED. 
LAWYERS SHOULD BE WORKING OFF 
OF COMMON TERMS AND UNDERSTAND 
THE WORDS THAT WE ARE USING. 
IT IS A PRETTY BASIC PRINCIPLE 
AMONG LAWYERS, WHEN YOU AGREE? 
>> IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT MY 
YEARBOOK, HAVE AT IT. 
>> LET'S LOOK AT BEACH WEEK 
RALPH CLUB BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR. 
WHAT DOES THE WORD RALPH MEAN? 
>> THAT PROBABLY REFERS TO 
THROWING UP. 
I AM KNOWN TO HAVE A WEAK 
STOMACH. 
LESS MAD CATCH UP ON SPAGHETTI, 
DID. 
>> THIS IS WELL KNOWN. 
ANYONE WHO HAS KNOWN ME, LIKE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE BEHIND ME, THEY 
KNOW THAT I HAVE A WEAK STOMACH
, WHETHER IT IS WITH BEER OR 
WITH SPICY FOOD OR ANYTHING. 
>> SO THE VOMITING THAT YOU 
REFERENCE IN THE RALPH CLUB 
REFERENCE RELATED TO THE 
CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL? 
>> SIR, I WAS THE TOP OF MY 
CLASS ACADEMICALLY. 
I BUSTED MY BUTT IN SCHOOL. 
I WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THE 
VARSITY BEST BALL TEAM. 
GOT INTO YALE COLLEGE. 
I GOT INTO YALE LAW SCHOOL. 
I WORKED MY TAIL OFF. 
>> AND? 
DID THE WORD RALPH, THAT YOU 
USED HERE. 
>> ALREADY ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
>> DO RELATE TO ALCOHOL? 
>> I LIKE BEER. 
WHAT YOU LIKE TO DRINK. 
>> THE NEXT QUESTION, I DON'T 
KNOW IF IT IS BUFFED --? 
>> THAT REFERS TO FLATULENCE. 
WE WERE 16. 
>> WHEN YOU'RE FRIEND MARK 
JUDGE PUT THE SAME THING BACK 
TO YOU, HE HAD THE SAME 
MEANING, IT WAS FLATULENCE? 
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DID, 
THAT WAS MY REGULATION. 
WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
FLATULENCE AT YOUR 16 ON 
YEARBOOK PAGE, I AM GAME. 
>> YOU MENTIONED, I THINK, THE 
RENATE, I DON'T KNOW THE 
PRONUNCIATION? 
AND WHAT DOES THE WORD ALUMNIUS 
MEAN. 
>> SHE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF 
OURS. 
A BUNCH OF US WENT TO DANCES 
WITH HER. 
SHE HUNG OUT WITH US AS A 
GROUP. 
THE MEDIA CIRCUS THAT HAS BEEN 
GENERATED BY THIS THOUGHT AND 
REPORTED THAT A REFERRED TO 
SEX. 
IT DID NOT. 
SHE HERSELF SAID ON THE RECORD, 
DID I HAVE ANY SEXUAL 
INTERACTION WITH HER. 
I AM SORRY THAT THIS HAS BEEN 
MISINTERPRETED AND SORRY IS! 
MY OPENING STATEMENT. 
SHE IS A GOOD PERSON. 
TO HAVE HER NAME DRAGGED 
THROUGH THE HEARING IS A JOKE. 
IT IS REALLY AN EMBARRASSMENT. 
>> DEVILS TRIANGLE? 
>> DRINKING GAME. 
>> HOW IS IT PLAYED? 
>> THREE GLASSES IN THE 
TRIANGLE. 
>> AND HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED 
QUARTERS? 
>> NO. 
>> AND DOHERTY? 
>> AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 
CALLER, SHE HAD A PARTY AND THE 
FOURTH OF JULY AT THE BEACH IN 
DELAWARE. 
>> THERE ARE 7F'S ON THE FOURTH 
OF JULY. DOES THAT MEAN? 
ONE OF OUR FRIENDS, KLOBUCHAR, 
WHEN HE SAID THE F WORD 
STARTING AT A YOUNG AGE,  HAD A 
WIND UP TO THE F WORD. 
AND THEN THE WORD WOULD COME 
OUT. 
WHEN WE WERE 15, WE THOUGHT 
THAT WAS FUNNY. 
IT BECAME AN INSIDE JOKE FOR 
HOW HE WOULD SAY WHAT I WILL 
NOT REAP -- TO BE HERE. 
>> REFERRING TO GEORGETOWN 
VERSUS LOUISVILLE. 
>> DO ANYMORE IN THE F? 
>> YOU RESPOND, WHO ONE THAT 
GAME ANYWAY. 
SHOULD WE DRAW ANY CONCLUSION 
THAT A LOSS OF RECOLLECTION 
RELATED TO ALCOHOL WAS THERE? 
>> FIRST HAND, WE WERE WATCHING 
IT ON TV AT A PARTY. 
>> THAT IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH
TRICKING AND NOT REMEMBERING 
WHAT HAPPENED. 
>> I'M AWARE. 
AT THE POINT OF BOTH IS THAT WE 
WERE, IN ESSENCE, HAVING A 
PARTY AND DID NOT PAY ATTENTION 
TO THE GAME, EVEN THOUGH THE 
GAME WAS THE EXCUSE WE HAD FOR 
GETTING TOGETHER. 
THAT IS VERY COMMON. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE BEEN 
TO A SUPER BOWL PARTY AND NOT 
PAID ATTENTION TO THE GAME AND 
JUST HUNG OUT WITH YOUR 
FRIENDS. 
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE DONE 
THAT OR NOT, BUT THAT IS WHAT 
WE ARE REFERRING TO. 
>> SENATOR CORNYN. 
>> JUDGE, I CANNOT THINK OF A 
MORE  EMBARRASSING SCANDAL FOR 
THE UNITED STATES SENATE SINCE 
THE McCARTHY HEARINGS. 
WHEN THE COMMENT WAS ABOUT THE 
CRUELTY OF THE PROCESS TOWARD 
THE PEOPLE INVOLVED. 
AND THE QUESTION WAS ASKED, 
HAVE YOU NO SENSE OF DECENCY? 
I AM AFRAID THAT WE HAVE LOST 
THAT, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME 
BEING. 
TO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE 
BEEN ACCUSED OF MULTIPLE 
CRIMES? 
>> I AM PAINFULLY AWARE, FOR MY 
FAMILY AND ME, TO READ ABOUT 
THIS. 
AND THE BREATHLESS REPORTING. 
>> THE SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT DR. 
FORD CLAIMS AND THAT YOU HAVE 
DENIED THE CLAIMS OF MS. 
RAMIREZ, THAT NOT EVEN THE NEW 
YORK TIMES A REPORT BECAUSE IT 
CANNOT CORROBORATE IT. 
AND THEN STORMY DANIELS LAWYER 
RELEASED A BOMBSHELL ACCUSING 
YOU OF GANG RAPE. 
ALL OF THOSE ARE CRIMES, ARE 
THEY NOT? 
>> THEY ARE. 
I'M NEVER GOING TO GET MY 
REPUTATION BACK. 
MY LIFE IS TOTALLY AND 
PERMANENTLY ALTERED. 
3 JUDGE, DO NOT GIVE UP. 
>> I'M NOT GIVING UP. 
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE 
LISTENING TO THIS AND THEY WILL 
MAKE THE DECISION. 
I THINK YOU WILL COME OUT ON 
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THAT. 
>> I WILL ALWAYS BE A GOOD 
PERSON AND TRY TO BE A GOOD 
JUDGE, WHATEVER HAPPENS. 
>> THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW. 
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF A 
CRIME. 
IF YOU HAVE LIED TO THE 
COMMITTEE AND THE 
INVESTIGATORS, THAT IS A CRIME 
IN AND OF ITSELF, IS THAT 
CORRECT? 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> IN ORDER TO VOTE AGAINST HER 
NOMINATION, WE WOULD HAVE TO 
CONCLUDE THAT YOU ARE A SERIAL 
LIAR. 
AND THAT YOU HAVE EXPOSED 
YOURSELF TO LEGAL JEOPARDY IN 
YOUR INTERACTION WITH THIS 
COMMITTEE AND THE INVESTIGATORS.
IS THAT NOT CORRECT? 
>> THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING. 
YOU TALKED IN YOUR INTERVIEW 
THE OTHER NIGHT ABOUT A FAIR 
PROCESS. 
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS 
THE AISLE SAY THAT THE BURDEN 
IS NOT ON THE ACCUSER, BECAUSE 
THIS IS A JOB INTERVIEW. THE 
BURDEN IS ON YOU. 
YOU SAY, YOU WERE NOT THERE AND 
IT DID NOT HAPPEN. 
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO 
PROVE A NEGATIVE. 
SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST YOU 
HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF A CRIME AND
THAT A FAIR PROCESS, UNDER THE 
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, 
UNDER NOTION OF FAIR PLAY, 
MEANS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE 
AN ACCUSATION AGAINST YOU HAVE 
TO COME FORWARD WITH SOME 
EVIDENCE. 
IS THAT NOT PART OF A FAIR 
PROCESS? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
>> PART OF THAT MEANS THAT IF 
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE AN 
ALLEGATION, THERE NEEDS TO BE 
COOPERATION. 
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE NOT 
GUILTY BECAUSE SOMEONE MAKES AN 
ACCUSATION AGAINST YOU IN THIS 
COUNTRY. 
WE ARE NOT A POLICE STATE. 
WE DO NOT GIVE THE GOVERNMENT 
THAT KIND OF POWER. 
WE INSIST THAT THOSE CHARGES BE 
PROVEN. 
I KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT IN A 
COURT. 
UNTIL MY CALLING IF WE WERE 
COURT, HALF OF THEM WILL BE IN 
ATTEMPT OF COURT. 
YOU HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF A 
CRIME. 
I BELIEVE, FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS 
OF FAIR PLAY AND JUSTICE IN THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. IF SOME 
IS GOING MAKE THE ACCUSATION, 
THEY NEED TO COME FORWARD TO 
SOME CORROBORATION, NOT JUST 
ALLEGATIONS. 
YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY. 
ABOUT THE DELAYS IN YOUR 
ABILITY TO COME HERE AND 
PROTECT YOUR GOOD NAME. 
BECAUSE IN THE INTERIM, IT JUST 
KEEPS GETTING WORSE. 
IT IS NOT DR. FORD. 
IT IS THE STORY THAT OUT OF THE 
NEW YORK TIMES WOULD REPORT. 
THE ALLEGATION OF MS. RAMIREZ, 
AND THEN STORMY DANIELS LAWYER. 
COMES UP WITH THIS INCREDIBLE 
STORY, ACCUSING YOU OF THE MOST 
SORDID AND SALACIOUS CONDUCT. 
IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. 
YOU ARE RIGHT TO BE ANGRY. 
THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO TELL 
YOUR STORY. 
I HOPE YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO 
TELL US EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO 
TELL US. 
THE BURDEN IS NOT 
>> IT'S HARD TO RECONSTRUCT 
WHAT HAPPENED 36 YEARS AGO AND 
I APPRECIATE THAT SHE HAS HAD 
AN INCIDENT AT SOME POINT IN 
HER LIFE. 
AND YOU ARE SYMPATHETIC TO THAT 
AND YOUR REPUTATION IS ON THE 
LINE. 
I HOPE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE 
GRAVITY OF THE CHARGES MADE 
AGAINST YOU AND WHAT A FAIR 
PROCESS LOOKS LIKE. 
>> SENATOR KLOBUCHAR? 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN, 
JUDGE. 
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DECENCY 
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THIS 
CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO ADVISE 
AND CONSENT. 
FOR ME, WHEN THIS EVIDENCE CAME 
FORWARD, I DECIDED THAT I 
NEEDED TO LOOK AT THIS AND I 
NEEDED TO FIND OUT ABOUT IT AND 
I NEEDED TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS 
ABOUT IT AS WELL IS OTHERS THAT 
WERE INVOLVED. 
SO, AGAIN, I'M NOT GOING TO 
TAKE QUITE THE SAME APPROACH AS 
MY COLLEAGUES AND TALK ABOUT 
DON MCGAHN OR ANY OF THIS. 
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK THE 
PRESIDENT? 
DR. FORD CAN'T DO THIS. 
WE CLEARLY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO 
DO THIS. 
JUST AS THE PRESIDENT TO REOPEN 
THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 
>> I THINK THE COMMITTEE -- YOU 
ARE DOING THE INVESTIGATION. 
I'M HERE TO ANSWER YOUR 
QUESTIONS. 
I SHOULD SAY ONE THING, SENATOR 
KLOBUCHAR. 
I APPRECIATE OUR MEETING 
TOGETHER AND I APPRECIATE HOW 
YOU HANDLED THE PRIOR HEARING 
AND I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR 
YOU. 
>> THANK YOU. 
ALL OF THAT ASIDE, HERE'S THE 
THING. 
YOU COULD ACTUALLY JUST GET 
THIS OPEN SO THAT WE CAN TALK 
TO THESE WITNESSES AND THE FBI 
CAN DO IT INSTEAD OF US. 
YOU'VE COME BEFORE US BUT WE 
HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MARK JUDGE, 
WHO DR. FORD SAYS WAS A WITNESS 
TO THIS. 
WE HAVE THIS POLYGRAPH EXPERT 
THAT MY COLLEAGUES WERE RAISING 
ISSUES ABOUT THAT. 
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT 
PERSON COME BEFORE US. 
I JUST THINK IF WE COULD OPEN 
THIS UP -- >> I DON'T MEAN TO 
INTERRUPT. 
BUT, I GUESS I AM. 
WITH MARK JUDGE HAS PROVIDED 
SWORN STATEMENTS SAYING THIS 
DIDN'T HAPPEN IN AND THAT I 
NEVER DID OR WOULD DO -- 
>> WE WOULD LIKE THE FBI TO 
FOLLOW UP AND ASK THEM 
QUESTIONS. 
YOU KNOW, WE TALKED ABOUT PAST 
NOMINATION PROCESSES AND YOU 
TALKED ABOUT THOSE. 
I NOTE THAT PRESIDENT GEORGE 
BUSH, IN THE ANITA HILL/JUSTICE 
THOMAS CASE, HE OPENED UP THE 
FBI INVESTIGATION AND LET 
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED. 
I THINK IT WAS HELPFUL FOR 
PEOPLE. 
WAS HIS DECISION REASONABLE? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT. 
WHAT I NO, SENATOR -- 
>> THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE THAT 
HE OPENED UP THE INVESTIGATION 
SO THE FBI COULD ASK SOME 
QUESTIONS. 
HE OPENED UP THE BACKGROUND 
CHECK. 
>> I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
ABOUT MY YEARBOOK OR ABOUT --
>> OKAY. 
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK ABOUT THE 
YEARBOOK. 
SO, MOST PEOPLE HAVE DONE SOME 
DRINKING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND 
COLLEGE AND MANY PEOPLE EVEN 
STRUGGLE WITH ALCOHOLISM AND 
BINGE DRINKING. 
MY OWN DAD STRUGGLED WITH 
ALCOHOLISM MOST OF HIS LIFE AND 
HE GOT IN TROUBLE FOR IT AND 
THERE WERE CONSEQUENCES. 
HE IS STILL IN AA AT AGED 90 
AND HE'S SOBER. 
IN HIS WORDS, HE WAS PURSUED BY 
GRACE AND THAT'S HOW HE GOT 
THROUGH THIS. 
IN YOUR CASE, YOU HAVE SAID 
HERE AND OTHER PLACES THAT YOU 
NEVER DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU 
DIDN'T REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. 
YET, WE HAVE HEARD, NOT UNDER 
OATH, BUT WE HAVE HEARD YOUR 
COLLEGE ROOMMATE SAY THAT YOU 
DID DRINK FREQUENTLY. 
THESE ARE IN NEWS REPORTS, THAT 
YOU WOULD SOMETIMES BE 
BELLIGERENT. ANOTHER CLASSMATE 
SAID IT'S NOT CREDIBLE FOR YOU 
TO SAY YOU DIDN'T HAVE MEMORY 
LAPSES. 
SO, DRINKING IS ONE THING -- 
>> I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK THAT 
IS THE SECOND QUOTE AS CORRECT. 
THE FIRST QUOTE, IF YOU WANTED, 
I PROVIDED SOME MATERIAL THAT 
IS STILL REDACTED ABOUT THE 
SITUATION WITH THE FRESHMAN 
YEAR ROOMMATE. 
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO REPEAT 
THAT IN A PUBLIC HEARING. úJUST 
THREE PEOPLE IN A ROOM. DAVE 
WHITE, JAMIE ROACH AND ME AND 
IT WAS A CONTENTIOUS SITUATION 
WHERE JAMIE DID NOT LIKE DAVE 
WHITE AT ALL. 
SO, DAVE WHITE CAME BACK FROM 
HOME ONE WEEKEND AND JAMIE 
ROACH HAD MOVED ALL HIS 
FURNITURE OUT INTO THE 
COURTYARD. 
SO, HE WALKED IN AND THAT WAS 
YOUR SOURCE ON THAT. 
>> DRINKING IS ONE THING -- 
>> THERE'S MUCH MORE. 
LOOK AT THE REDACTED PORTION OF 
WHAT I SAID. I 
DON'T WANT TO REPEAT IT IN A 
PUBLIC HEARING. 
>> I WILL. 
>> THE REDACTED INFORMATION -- 
>> DRINKING IS ONE THING BUT 
THE CONCERN IS ABOUT 
TRUTHFULNESS AND IN YOUR 
WRITTEN TESTIMONY YOU SAID 
SOMETIMES YOU HAD TOO MANY 
DRINKS. 
WAS THERE EVER A TIME WHEN YOU 
DRINK SO MUCH THAT YOU COULDN'T 
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED OR PART 
OF WHAT HAPPENED THE NIGHT 
BEFORE? 
>> NO. 
I REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED. 
I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY HAD 
BEERS, SENATOR. 
>> YOU ARE SAYING THERE HAS 
NEVER BEEN A CASE WHERE YOU 
DRANK SO MUCH THAT YOU DIDN'T 
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED THE 
NIGHT BEFORE OR PART OF WHAT 
HAPPENED? 
>> YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT A 
BLACKOUT. 
I DON'T KNOW, HAVE YOU? 
>> COULD YOU ANSWER THE 
QUESTION, JUDGE? 
THAT'S NOT HAPPEN, IS THAT YOUR 
ANSWER? 
>> YES. 
I'M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE. 
>> I HAVE NO DRINKING PROBLEM, 
JUDGE. 
>> NOR DO I. 
>> OKAY. 
THANK YOU. 
>> SENATOR HATCH, SINCE THIS 
FBI THING KEEPS COMING UP ALL 
THE TIME, LET'S GET BACK TO 
BASICS. 
FIRST OF ALL, ANYBODY, 
INCLUDING ANY SENATOR THAT 
BROUGHT UP THIS ISSUE, COULD 
ASK FOR AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
WHAT THE FBI DOES IS GATHER 
INFORMATION FOR THE WHITE HOUSE 
AND THEN THE FILE IS SENT TO 
THE COMMITTEE FOR US TO MAKE 
OUR OWN EVALUATIONS. 
WE ARE CAPABLE OF MAKING OUR 
OWN DETERMINATION ABOUT THE 
ACCURACY OF ANY OF THOSE 
ALLEGATIONS. 
THE FBI HAS PUT OUT A STATEMENT 
-- I SUPPOSE IT IS A MONTH AGO 
-- CLEARLY STATING THIS MATTER 
IS CLOSED, AS FAR AS THE LETTER 
BEING SENT TO THEM. 
THERE IS NO FEDERAL CRIME TO 
INVESTIGATE IF SENATE DEMOCRATS 
HOPE FOR THE FBI TO DRAW ANY 
CONCLUSIONS ON THIS MATTER. 
I'M GOING TO REMIND YOU WHAT 
JOE BIDEN SAID. 
I SAID THIS IN MY STATEMENT BUT 
MAYBE PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO 
WHAT I SAY AND MAYBE THEY WON'T 
EVEN HEAR THIS. 
JOE BIDEN, QUOTE, THE NEXT 
PERSON WHO REFERS TO AN FBI 
REPORT AS BEING WORTH ANYTHING, 
OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T UNDERSTAD 
ANYTHING. 
THE FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN 
THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE, REACH A 
CONCLUSION, PERIOD. 
THEY SAY, HE SAID, SHE SAID, 
THEY SAID, PERIOD. 
WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE AND FBI 
REPORT BEFORE YOU OR EVEN BRING 
IT UP NOW AS SOMETHING 
PROSPECTIVELY -- THAT WASN'T IN 
HIS QUOTE -- UNDERSTAND, THEY 
DO NOT, THEY DO NOT, THEY DO 
NOT REACH CONCLUSIONS. 
THEY DO NOT MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
SENATOR HATCH? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN? 
MR. CHAIRMAN? 
MAY I SAY FOR THE RECORD THAT, 
ACTUALLY, WE HAVE ASKED. 
YOU SAID NOBODY HAS ASKED THE 
FBI OR WE COULD ASK THE FBI. 
I ACTUALLY HAVE. I 
THINK OTHERS HAVE IN THE ISSUE 
IS THAT PART OF WHAT THE FBI 
REPORT DOES IS TO INVESTIGATE 
AND SEEK EITHER CORROBORATING 
OR EXCULPATORY EVIDENCE. 
IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE CONCLUSION 
IT DRAWS AS THE BREADTH OF THE 
EVIDENCE THAT IS SOUGHT OUT 
THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION AND 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT 
SOMEBODY MIGHT SAY TO AN FBI 
AGENT WHEN THEY ARE BEING 
EXAMINED. 
FOR INSTANCE, MR. JUDGE'S 
LETTER SIGNED BY HIS LAWYER 
SENT IN, IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT 
THING. 
I BELIEVE, STILL, THAT THIS IS 
THE FIRST BACKGROUND 
INVESTIGATION IN THE HISTORY OF 
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS THAT 
HASN'T BEEN REOPENED WHEN NEW 
CREDIBLE DEROGATORY INFORMATION 
WAS RAISED ABOUT THE SUBJECT, 
ABOUT THE NOMINEE. 
YOU KNOW, I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO 
LET THE POINT YOU MADE STAND 
WITHOUT REFERENCING WHAT WE HAVE
TRIED TO DO. 
>> PARDON ME. I 
WILL ADD TO THE POINT YOU MADE. 
THE LETTER WAS SENT TO THE FBI. 
THE FBI SENT IT TO THE WHITE 
HOUSE WITH A LETTER SAYING THE 
CASES CLOSED. 
WE ARE TAKING A BREAK, NOW, 
SENATOR. 
WE ARE TAKING A BREAK NOW. 
>> A 15 MINUTE BREAK. 
>> OKAY. 
ANOTHER BREAK IN THE KAVANAUGH 
HEARINGS. 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN, 
CHUCK GRASSLEY, JUST CALLED FOR 
IT AND WE HAVE NOT BEEN ADVISED 
HOW LONG THAT BREAK WILL BE BUT 
WELCOME BACK TO THOSE OF YOU 
WATCHING. 
YOU BEEN WATCHING THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY HEARINGS. 
IF YOU ARE JUST JOINING US, 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH HAS 
DENIED FORCEFULLY THAT HE 
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD WHEN THEY WERE 
TEENAGERS. 
WE WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU, 
PERHAPS, THE MOST EMOTIONAL 
MOMENT OF THE DAY OUTSIDE OF THE
KAVANAUGH TESTIMONY, WE SHOULD 
SAY, WHICH CAME SHORTLY AFTER 
THAT ENDED. 
THAT WAS REPUBLICAN SENATOR 
LINDSEY GRAHAM. 
WE WILL DIGEST A LOT OF THIS IN 
JUST A MOMENT AND PLAY MORE 
SOUND BEYOND THIS. 
LET'S START WITH SOME OF THAT 
LINDSEY GRAHAM AUDIO BECAUSE 
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS BEEN 
REACTING TO IT. 
>> IF YOU WANTED THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION, YOU COULD HAVE 
COME TO US. 
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS DESTROY 
THIS GUY'S LIFE, HOLD THIS SEAT 
OPEN AND HOPE YOU WIN IN 2020. 
YOU'VE SAID THAT! 
NOT ME. 
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO APOLOGIZE 
FOR. 
WHEN YOU SEE SOTOMAYOR AND 
KAGAN, TELL THEM LINDSAY SAID 
HELLO BECAUSE I VOTED FOR THEM. 
I WOULD NEVER DO TO THEM WHAT 
YOU'VE DONE TO THIS GUY. 
THIS IS THE MOST UNETHICAL SHAM 
SINCE I'VE BEEN IN POLITICS. IF 
YOU REALLY WANTED TO KNOW THE 
TRUTH, YOU SURE AS WOULDN'T 
HAVE DONE WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO 
THIS GUY. 
ARE YOU A GANG RAPIST? 
NO. 
I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT YOU AND 
YOUR FAMILY HAVE GONE THROUGH. 
YOU WANT POWER, I HOPE YOU NEVER
GET IT. 
I HOPE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN 
SEE THROUGH THIS SHAM. 
THAT YOU KNEW ABOUT IT AND YOU 
HELD IT. 
YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF PRETEND
-- OF PROTECTING DR. FORD. 
NONE. 
SHE IS AS MUCH A VICTIM AS YOU 
ARE. 
GOD I HATE TO SAY IT BECAUSE 
THESE HAVE BEEN MY FRIENDS. 
LET ME TELL YOU WHEN IT COMES 
TO THIS, YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A 
FAIR PROCESS, YOU CAME TO THE 
WRONG TOWN AT THE WRONG TIME, 
MY FRIEND. 
DO YOU CONSIDER THIS A JOB 
INTERVIEW? 
>> THE ADVICE AND CONSENT ROLE 
IS LIKE A JOB. 
>> YOU CONSIDER THAT YOU'VE 
BEEN TO A JOB INTERVIEW. 
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH A PROCESS 
OF ADVICE AND CONSENT UNDER THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
>> WOULD YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN 
THROUGH HECK? 
>> I'VE BEEN THROUGH HECK AND 
THEN SOME. 
>> THIS IS NOT A JOB INTERVIEW, 
THIS IS HELD. 
THIS IS GOING TO DESTROY THE 
ABILITY OF GOOD PEOPLE TO COME 
FORWARD BECAUSE OF THIS CRAP. 
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK. YOU 
HAVE INTERACTED WITH 
PROFESSIONAL WOMEN ALL YOUR 
LIFE. 
NOT ONE ACCUSATION. 
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM WAS THE FIRST 
GOP SENATOR TO ASK QUESTIONS 
AND NOT DEFER TO THE PROSECUTOR 
THE REPUBLICANS HAD SELECTED 
WHO DID THE EARLIER QUESTIONING 
OF CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 
THE PRESIDENT SAID AT HIS NEWS 
CONFERENCE YESTERDAY HE WOULD 
BE WATCHING HEARINGS TODAY AND 
HE IS AN OFFICIAL AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
THEY NOW TELL US THEY ARE 
PLEASED WITH KAVANAUGH'S STRONG 
FULL THROATED RESPONSE. 
IT'S A TOWN THEY SAID THEY HAVE 
BEEN WAITING FOR FROM HIM. 
WE'VE SEEN AND NUMBER OF TWEETS 
GOING OUT FROM VARIOUS MEMBERS 
OF THE WHITE HOUSE ENDORSING 
WHAT THEY'VE HEARD, SO FAR FROM 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
JOINING ME IN OUR COVERAGE, NOW 
WE HAVE BIANNA GOLODRYGA, 
COHOST JOHN DICKERSON, JAN 
CRAWFORD WHO COVERS A SUPREME 
COURT AND THE NEWS ANALYST, 
RIKKI KLEIMAN AND OUR POLITICAL 
CORRESPONDENT, ED O'KEEFE, 
OUTSIDE THE HEARING ROOM AND 
TRYING TO GET WHATEVER 
INFORMATION FROM SENATORS. 
>> I THINK LINDSEY GRAHAM 
SPARED JUDGE KAVANAUGH A LOT OF 
THE EMOTIONS AND THEY WERE 
SHOWING LINDSEY GRAHAM HAVE WAS 
KNOWN TO EXPRESS HIMSELF IN 
WHATEVER OPINION ON WHATEVER 
TOPIC. 
I KNOW YOU HAD A LOT OF 
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT LINDSAY, 
WHAT SENATOR GRAHAM WAS TRYING 
TO CONVEY IN HIS MESSAGE WITHIN 
THE PARTY AND OTHER REPUBLICANS 
WHO MAY BE ON THE FENCE ABOUT 
WHAT THEY SHOULD BE DOING. 
>> THIS IS THE FIRST CHANCE TO 
FRAME POLITICALLY AND LINDSEY 
GRAHAM IN ADDITION TO THAT 
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE SAID TO 
FELLOW REPUBLICANS, IF YOU DON'T
VOTE FOR HIM, IF YOU VOTE 
AGAINST HIM YOU WILL CONFIRM 
AND VALIDATE WHAT LINDSEY 
GRAHAM JUST DESCRIBED, AND 
AWFUL PROCESS THAT RUINED A 
FAMILY THAT WEREN'T -- THAT 
RUINED A MAN. 
OF THIS IS ABOUT DETERMINING 
WHAT THE QUESTION IS, WHAT THE 
NARRATIVE IS, LINDSEY GRAHAM IS 
TRYING TO DO THAT FOR THE ON 
THE FENCE REPUBLICANS SAYING, 
THIS IS WHAT THE STAKES ARE. A 
VOTE AGAINST KAVANAUGH IS A 
VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE KIND OF 
SCORCHED EARTH POLITICS HE JUST 
DESCRIBED. 
AS JAN SAID EARLIER, THAT'S A 
MESSAGE TO THE REPUBLICAN BASE. 
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND 
ANY REPUBLICAN SENATOR WHO 
CAVES TO THAT PRESSURE SHOULD 
BE PUNISHED. 
>> WHAT YOU ARE SAYING AND WHAT 
LINDSEY GRAHAM IS SAYING, IF 
YOU VOTE AGAINST, YOU ARE 
ENDORSING CHARACTER 
ASSASSINATION? 
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. 
IT'S ABOUT FRAMING THE QUESTION 
AND THAT IS ABOUT POLITICS. 
HE WAS TRYING TO FRAME THE 
QUESTION FOR HIS OWN SIDE ANDI 
THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY 
EFFECTIVE. 
>> JAN? 
>> I THINK BRETT KAVANAUGH 
REALLY LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR 
THAT. 
HE GAVE THAT OPENING STATEMENT 
AND AS THE REPORTERS SAID IN THE
ROOM, THE ROOM WAS JUST -- YOU 
COULD HEAR A PIN DROP. 
TO SEE THE EMOTION FROM HIM AND 
AS HE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THIS 
HAD DONE TO HIM, HIS LIFE, HIS 
FAMILY, HIS PARENTS AND 
CHILDREN, THAT REALLY THEN SET 
THE GROUNDWORK FOR SENATOR 
GRAHAM'S QUITE FIERY AND 
EMOTIONAL RESPONSE, ENCOURAGING 
-- NOT ENCOURAGING -- FLAT OUT 
SAYING THAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO 
VOTE AGAINST THIS MAN, NOT ONLY 
IS IT A VOTE FOR CHARACTER 
ASSASSINATION, BUT IT IS A VOTE 
FOR THE TACTICS THAT THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE USED. 
HE CAME OUT OF THAT AND WHAT 
LED TO THIS WAS THE DEMOCRATS 
ARE PUSHING ABOUT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
SENATOR GRAHAM'S POINT, THIS IS 
RIDICULOUS. 
DEMOCRATS SAID ON THIS FOR TWO 
MONTHS AND WE COULD HAVE HAD 
THE FBI -- WE COULD HAVE HAD 
ALL KIND OF INVESTIGATIONS. 
THAT IS ALL SO THAT WHEN YOU 
SEE THIS WITH THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION, THAT GIVES THE 
REPUBLICANS A CHANCE TO SAY, YOU
SAT ON THIS FOR TWO MONTHS. 
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS TO BE 
CAREFUL. 
THERE'S ONE THING TO BE 
DEFENSIVE ABOUT YOUR CHARACTER 
AND IF HE BELIEVES HE WASN'T 
THERE AND DIDN'T DO THIS, BY 
ALL MEANS DEFEND YOUR ACTION 
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT HE DID IN 
COLLEGE, AND HIGH SCHOOL, HIS 
YEARBOOK AND HIS DRINKING AND 
THE FBI INVESTIGATION, THERE 
ARE TIMES WHERE HE APPROACHES 
THAT LINE-UP NOT GOING OVER 
THAT LINE OF BEING A BIT TOO 
DEFENSIVE. 
HAS NEVER ONCE SAID YES, I 
INVITE AN FBI INVESTIGATION. 
HE SAID I WILL LET YOU DECIDE 
TO DO AND I WILL DO WHATEVER 
YOU TELL ME TO DO. 
I THINK THE DRINKING, DID YOU 
DRINK, DID YOU EVER BLANK OUT 
DRINK TO THE SENATORS ASKING 
THOSE QUESTIONS? 
THAT COULD TURN OUT TO BITE 
HIM. 
>> I THINK THAT'S TRUE. 
IT SHOWS EVASIVENESS IN REAL 
TIME. 
DICK DURBIN CAREFULLY TRIED TO 
PUT HIM IN THE CORNER AND SAID, 
JUST ASK THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER 
DON MCGAHN TO CALL IN THE FBI. 
THAT WAS A TACTIC, A TRICK. 
IN THE MOMENT WHEN KAVANAUGH 
DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY RESPOND OR 
GIVES AN ANSWER LIKE SAYING, 
I'M HERE NOW, IT'S A REALTIME 
DEMONSTRATION OF EQUIVOCATION. 
THAT COULD BE A CHALLENGE FOR 
HIM. 
>> ALL OF THIS RIVETING 
TESTIMONY COMES AFTER THE 
MORNING SESSION, IN WHICH 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD DID NOT 
APPEAR EVASIVE, APPEARED VERY 
OPEN. 
THE TOWN BETWEEN THE TWO 
HEARINGS, MORNING AND 
AFTERNOON, CERTAINLY VERY 
DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE 
ARE HEARING FROM BOTH THE 
PRINCIPLES INVOLVED. 
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT 
FOR THE SENATORS TO GO THROUGH. 
>> THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THEIR 
GAME PLAN ON. 
THEY ARE COHESIVE THIS 
úAFTERNO 
I THINK YOU COULD SAY THEY WERE 
COHESIVE THIS MORNING AND THEY 
MADE A DECISION NOT TO THE 
QUESTIONING, BUT TO USE THE 
PROFESSIONAL PROSECUTOR DO THE 
QUESTIONING FOR WHAT GOOD OR 
BAD ACTED THEM. 
THEY TREATED DR. FORD WITH 
RESPECT AND IT'S OF THE IDEA 
THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DR. 
FORD AND IT JUST WASN'T BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
THERE IS A FEELING OF SYMPATHY 
AND EMPATHY. 
THEY PLAYED THE ROLE OF BEING 
THE GOOD GUYS. 
EVEN WITH A POLITICAL MESSAGE 
TO GIVE, IT IS HIGHLY COHESIVE. 
THEY'RE COMING TO A POINT TO 
GET WHAT THEY WANT, AND WHAT 
THEY WANT ARE THESE FEW VOTES 
THAT MAY BE UP IN THE AIR. 
YOU KNOW, THE GAUNTLET -- IT'S 
BEEN DROPPED. 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT UP OR ELSE 
LOOK WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 
THE ONLY THING I SEE AS A WORRY 
FOR BRETT KAVANAUGH, AS HE TAKES
THIS BREAK AND HAS A GLASS OF 
WATER OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT 
CENTERS HIM, OR GIVES A HUG TO 
HIS WIFE, TO FEEL SUPPORT, HE 
MUST BE CAREFUL OF NOT LOSING 
HIS TEMPER. 
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT HE 
REALLY HAS TO WATCH. 
>> DO YOU THINK THERE ARE 
PEOPLE TELLING HIM THAT RIGHT 
NOW? 
>> I THINK SOMEONE HAS TOLD HIM 
THAT ALREADY OR HE KNOWS IT. 
THE DEMOCRATS, AS THEY GO DOWN 
THE LINE, THEY WILL TRY TO BAIT 
HIM. 
ONE OF THE FEW THINGS IN THIS 
EXAMINATION, BESIDES IF YOU 
WANT THE FBI INVESTIGATION, IS 
THE IDEA OF HIS BEING A 
BELLIGERENT DRUNK AND ACTING 
OUT IN A WAY THAT WAS OUT OF 
CHARACTER. 
SO, THAT PERSON, THE 
BELLIGERENT DRUNK, THE ABUSIVE 
DRUNK, THE DRUNK WHO MIGHT NOT 
REMEMBER WHAT HE DID AND DO 
SOMETHING ON TOWARD, THAT 
PERSON WOULD NOT BE FIT TO BE 
ON THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. 
>> ALSO ABOUT BEING TRUTHFUL. 
I KNOW IT'S SMALL AND I CAN 
ONLY IMAGINE WHAT WE WOULD BE 
GOING THROUGH IF WE RELIVED 
WHAT WE DID AND PUT IN OUR 
YEARBOOK IN HIGH SCHOOL AND 
WHAT HAVE YOU, BUT, THIS IS ONE 
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS IN 
THE COUNTRY, IF NOT THE WORLD. 
SO MUCH OF IT DEPENDS ON 
HONESTY AND TRUTHFULNESS. 
THE PARTS ABOUT THE YEARBOOK, 
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT RENATE. 
AS SMALL AS IT MAY BE, BOYS 
TREATED GIRLS BADLY IN HIGH 
SCHOOL, AND FOR HIM TO 
DEFINITIVELY SAY THAT SHE WAS 
ONE OF US AND THIS WAS HER 
BEING BUDDIES WITH THE BOYS AND 
WE HAD HIGH RESPECT. 
HEARING HER SIDE OF THE STORY, 
I FIND IT PERSONALLY SO HARD TO 
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS WHAT THAT 
MEANT. I 
KNOW IT'S SMALL BUT IN THE 
LARGER SCHEME OF THINGS WHEN 
YOU TALK ABOUT SOMEONE'S 
CHARACTER, FOR HIM TO STAND BY 
THE STATEMENT THAT SHE WAS ONE 
OF US -- I DON'T KNOW -- THAT 
DOESN'T SIT WELL WITH ME. 
>> HE TOOK ISSUE WITH THE FOLKS 
THAT ORGANIZE THE YEARBOOK. 
>> YOU HAVE TO THINK BACK, THIS 
WAS 1982. 
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME. 
>> I MEAN, THAT WAS PART OF 
THIS, PROBABLY MAYBE EVEN 
WORSE. 
THOSE WERE THE MOVIES, ANIMAL 
HOUSE. 
THEY WOULDN'T MAKE THOSE MOVIES 
TODAY. 
>> THE DEMOCRATIC EFFORT IS THAT
PRESUMABLY THEY ARE INQUIRING 
IN THIS AREA BECAUSE THEY WANT 
TO KNOW IF THE KAVANAUGH 
DESCRIBED BY HIS FRIEND IN THE 
BOOK ABOUT EXCESSIVE DRINKING
AND THE KAVANAUGH DESCRIBED BY 
DR. FORD, IF THAT PERSON IS 
EVEN ONE THAT IS POSSIBLE TO 
APPROACH BY EVIDENCE THEY CAN 
GATHER FROM INQUIRING FROM HIM. 
BUT, THAT FRAMING HAS BEEN LOST 
A LITTLE AND THERE'S JUST 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE YEARBOOK. 
ANYBODY WHO HASN'T BEEN 
FOLLOWING THIS QUITE CLOSELY 
WITH THING, WHY ARE THEY ASKING 
ABOUT THE YEARBOOK? 
WHY IS THAT RELEVANT? 
THAT IS A CHALLENGE FOR 
DEMOCRATS. 
>> OUTSIDE OF THE YEARBOOK AND 
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE 
ALLEGATIONS, SO MUCH OF THIS 
HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON THE 
TIMELINE. 
THAT IS REPUBLICANS TALKING 
THIS MORNING ABOUT, WHY DIDN'T 
YOU TELL US THIS EARLIER AND 
DEMOCRATS SAYING, WHY CAN WE 
TAKE A LITTLE MORE TIME AND 
HAVE THIS FBI INVESTIGATION? 
SO MUCH OF IT HAS RETURNED 
TODAY, TO THAT TIMING ISSUE. 
>> OF COURSE. 
THAT WAS EXACTLY WHERE RACHEL 
MITCHELL WAS GOING THIS 
MORNING. 
SHE SPENT, I WOULD SAY, AT 
LEAST HALF OF HER FIVE MINUTE 
INTERVIEWS DEALING WITH THE 
TIMELINE AND THAT IS A 
POLITICAL INQUIRY, NOT A 
FACTUAL CREDIBILITY INQUIRY. 
THAT LED TO THE FOUNDATION FOR 
EXACTLY WHERE LINDSEY GRAHAM 
WAS GOING TO GO. 
SO, I THINK THAT THEY'VE 
THOUGHT THIS OUT ON THE 
REPUBLICAN SIDE. 
IN A WAY, PERHAPS, THAT THE 
DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT, WHICH 
SURPRISES ME. 
>> I ALSO THINK REPUBLICANS 
GENUINELY BELIEVE. 
THEY KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS. 
DEMOCRATS SAY THEY WANT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION. 
HOW LONG DOES THAT TAKE? 
YOU GET THAT NOW, WE NEED 
ANOTHER HEARING ON THAT WILL 
TAKE ANOTHER TWO WEEKS TO 
SCHEDULE THE HEARING BECAUSE 
SHE'S GOT TO COME BACK AND THEY 
HAVE TO GET WITNESSES. 
ONE OF THEM IS VERY ILL AND WE 
MAY NOT GET HER BACK. 
THAT'S ANOTHER THREE OR FOUR 
WEEKS. 
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU GET TO 
THE MIDTERMS. 
THEY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN 
EFFORT TO PUSH THIS PAST THE 
MIDTERMS, DEFEAT BRETT KAVANAUGH
AND THEN NO OTHER NOMINEE WILL 
EVER BE CONFIRMED IF DEMOCRATS 
TAKE THE SENATE. 
THEY WILL KEEP THAT SEAT OPEN. 
IN SOME WAYS, THIS IS PAYBACK 
FOR MERRICK GARLAND. 
SO, REPUBLICANS REALLY SEE THAT 
AS THE GAME PLAN. 
THAT IS WHY THEY THINK THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION IS A PURE SMOKE 
SCREEN. 
>> THAT IS HOW KAVANAUGH SEES 
IT, UNDOUBTEDLY. 
THAT IS WHY HE IS NOT SAYING 
SURE, HAVE THE FBI, BECAUSE 
THERE IS A LOT -- 
>> WHEN REPUBLICANS SAY DELAY, 
THERE IS -- IT'S FACTUAL AND 
THERE IS TRUTH IN IT. 
>> IS ALSO FIGHTING FOR HIS 
CHARACTER. 
FORGIVE ME IF I'M WRONG BECAUSE 
I MAY WELL BE. 
TO DR. FORD INITIALY ASKED TO 
SPEAK AFTER HIM? 
>> IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC 
OPINION, AS WERE -- AS YOU ARE 
SAYING, IF SOMEONE JUST TURNED 
THIS ON AND WATCHED JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, THERE IS A LOT TO 
TAKE AWAY FROM HIM, FROM HIS 
EMOTION AND WHAT SEEMED TO BE 
PAIN THAT HE AND HIS FAMILY HAD 
GONE THROUGH, FROM HIS 
STEADFASTNESS AND SAYING I WAS 
NOT THERE AND THIS DID NOT 
HAPPEN. 
COMPARE THAT TO EVERYONE'S 
REACTION AFTER WATCHING DR. 
FORD. 
IF YOU HAD ONLY SEEN ONE, YOU 
WOULD SAY BOTH ARE EQUALLY 
COMPELLING, RIGHT? 
>> IN AMERICA, IF YOU ARE 
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, OR SYSTEM 
OF JUSTICE -- AND I KNOW IT'S 
NOT A COURT ROOM -- BUT IF YOU 
ARE ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, YOU 
ARE ENTITLED TO HEAR THE 
ALLEGATIONS AGAINST YOU BEFORE 
YOU RESPOND. 
THE SUGGESTION THAT HE WOULD GO 
FIRST, THE INITIAL SUGGESTION, 
WHICH FUELS DISTRESS BY 
REPUBLICANS, BY THE WAY, BUT 
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IT'S ALL 
DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVES, THE 
SUGGESTION WAS AND WHAT THEY 
WOULD ARGUE FOR -- WHAT THEY 
ARGUE WITH IS THAT HE WOULD 
TESTIFY AND THEN SHE WOULD 
TESTIFY AND HE WOULD HAVE NO 
CHANCE FOR REBUTTAL. 
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FAIR 
PROCESS, I MEAN -- IF YOU ARE 
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING, YOU HAVE 
TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT THE 
ALLEGATIONS ARE AGAINST YOU AND 
TO RESPOND. 
THIS IS AMERICA. 
>> REPUBLICANS MUST BE FEELING 
BETTER NOW. 
>> A LOT BETTER. 
>> AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY BACK 
TO THE HEARING ROOM, WE BELIEVE 
THIS BREAK IS ENDING VERY SOON, 
I WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE TO 
LISTEN TO BOTH OF THE 
PRINCIPLES. 
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SOUND 
FROM THE MOST RECENT TESTIMONY 
AND THAT IS JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
>> THE OTHER NIGHT, ASHLEY AND 
MY DAUGHTER ELIZA SAID PRAYERS. 
ELIZA, 10 YEARS OLD -- SAID TO 
ASHLEY, WE SHOULD PRAY FOR THE 
WOMAN. 
THAT'S A LOT OF WISDOM FROM A 
10-YEAR-OLD. 
WE MEAN NO ILL WILL. 
>> NOW, IF WE CAN, SOME OF THE 
MOST EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY WE 
HEARD FROM THE MORNING. 
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD WAS ASKED 
THIS MORNING, WAS WHAT WAS MOST 
MEMORABLE ABOUT THAT NIGHT IN 
1982, FOR HER. 
>> WE DON'T HAVE IT. 
WE WILL TRY TO GET THAT BECAUSE 
I THINK, TO YOUR POINT, IT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T 
SEEN THE ENTIRETY, AS WE HAVE, 
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE AND 
MORE HELPFUL FOR SENATORS TO 
HEAR EVERYTHING. 
BRETT KAVANAUGH SITTING BACK 
DOWN NOW. 
>> JUDGE, ARE YOU READY? 
>> I AM READY. 
CAN I SAY ONE THING? 
>> YES. 
>> I STARTED MY LAST COLLOQUY 
BY SAYING TO SENATOR KLOBUCHAR 
HOW MUCH I RESPECTED HER AND 
WHAT SHE DID AT THE LAST 
HEARING AND SHE ASKED ME A 
QUESTION AT THE END THAT I 
RESPONDED BY ASKING HER A 
QUESTION. 
I'M SORRY I DID THAT. 
THIS IS A TOUGH PROCESS AND I'M 
SORRY ABOUT THAT. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. I 
WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WHEN YOU 
HAVE A PARENT THAT IS 
ALCOHOLIC, YOU ARE PRETTY 
CAREFUL ABOUT DRINKING AND THE 
SECOND THING, I WAS TRULY JUST 
TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF 
THE FACTS AND THE EVIDENCE. 
AGAIN, I BELIEVE WE DO THAT BY 
OPENING UP THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION AND I WOULD CALL 
IT A BACKGROUND CHECK INSTEAD OF
INVESTIGATION. 
THANK YOU. 
>> I APPRECIATE THAT. 
>> SENATOR HATCH? 
>> THANK YOU, JUDGE. 
WELCOME. 
WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. 
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW 
WORDS. 
MY FRIEND FROM ARIZONA 
EMPHASIZED YESTERDAY THAT WE 
HAVE, BEFORE US TODAY, TWO 
HUMAN BEINGS. 
DR. FORD AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
THEY DESERVE, EACH OF YOU 
DESERVE TO BE TREATED FAIRLY 
AND RESPECTFULLY. 
WE TRIED TO DO THAT WITH THE 
DOCTOR FORD EARLIER AND I THINK 
WE SUCCEEDED. 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TREAT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH FAIRLY, NOW. 
IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW 
THAT'S GOING TO WORK OUT. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH HAS BEEN A 
FEDERAL JUDGE FOR 12 YEARS AND 
HAS BEEN A GREAT FEDERAL JUDGE 
ON THE SECOND HIGHEST COURT IN 
THE NATION. 
HE'S EARNED A REPUTATION FOR 
FAIRNESS AND DECENCY. 
HIS CLERKS LOVE HIM. 
HIS STUDENTS -- HE TEACHES IN 
LAW SCHOOL. 
HIS STUDENTS LOVE HIM. 
HIS COLLEAGUES LOVE HIM. 
THIS MAN IS NOT A MONSTER, NOR 
IS HE WHAT HAS BEEN REPRESENTED 
HERE IN THESE HEARINGS. 
WE ARE TALKING TODAY ABOUT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CONDUCT IN 
HIGH SCHOOL. 
EVEN THEN, AS A FRESHMAN IN 
COLLEGE, I GUESS, AS WELL. 
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS HAVE BEEN 
RAISED IF JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT, HE 
SHOULD NOT SERVE ON THE SUPREME 
COURT. 
I THINK WE SHOULD WOULD ALL 
AGREE WITH THAT. 
THE CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE CREATED 
SINCE THE DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES 
FOR SLEEP THE ALLEGATIONS TO 
THE MEDIA TWO WEEKS AGO, AFTER 
SITTING ON THEM FOR SIX WEEKS, 
I MIGHT ADD, IT'S BROUGHT US 
THE WORST IN OUR POLITICS. 
IT CERTAINLY HAS BROUGHT US NO 
CLOSER TO THE TRUTH. 
ANONYMOUS LETTERS WITH NO NAME 
AND NO RETURN ADDRESS ARE NOT 
BEING TREATED AS NATIONAL -- 
ARE NOW BEING TREATED AS 
NATIONAL NEWS. 
PORN STAR LAWYERS WITH 
IMPLAUSIBLE CLIENTS ARE DRIVING 
THE NEWS CYCLE. I 
HATE TO SAY THIS, BUT THIS IS 
WORSE THAN ROBERT BORK AND I 
DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET WORSE 
THAN THAT. 
IT'S WORSE THAN CLARENCE THOMAS 
AND I DIDN'T THINK IT COULD GET 
ANY WORSE THAN THAT. 
THIS IS A NATIONAL DISGRACE THE 
WAY YOU ARE BEING TREATED. 
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL WE HAVE 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, A MAN UNTIL 
TWO WEEKS AGO, WAS A PILLAR OF 
THE LEGAL COMMUNITY AND THERE'S 
BEEN NO WHISPER OF MISCONDUCT 
BY HIM IN THE TIME HE'S BEEN A 
JUDGE. 
BUT WE HAVE ARE UNCORROBORATED, 
UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS FROM HIS 
TEENAGE YEARS! 
CRIMES THAT EVERY A LODGE AND 
EYE WITNESS HAS EITHER DENIED 
OR FAILED TO CORROBORATE. 
I DID NOT MEAN TO MINIMIZE THE 
SERIOUSNESS OF THE CLAIMS. 
THEY'VE BEEN SERIOUS CLAIMS BUT 
THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH HAS TO 
INVOLVE MORE THAN BARE 
ASSERTIONS. 
LIKE DR. FORD, JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
DESERVES FAIR TREATMENT. 
HE WAS AN IMMATURE 
HIGHSCHOOLER. 
SO WERE WE ALL. 
THAT HE WROTE OR SAID STUPID 
THINGS DOES NOT MAKE HIM A 
SEXUAL PREDATOR PREDATOR. 
I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE OF MY 
COLLEAGUES TO TEAR DOWN THIS 
MAN AT ANY COST. 
I DO UNDERSTAND IT BUT LET'S AT 
LEAST BE FAIR AND LOOK AT THE 
FACT OR THE ABSENCE THEREOF. 
GUILT BY ASSOCIATION IS WRONG. 
IMMATURITY DOES NOT EQUAL 
CRIMINALITY. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH DRANK IN HIGH 
SCHOOL OR COLLEGE, BUT THAT 
DOESN'T MAKE HIM GUILTY OF 
EVERY TERRIBLE THING THAT HE'S 
RECENTLY BEEN ACCUSED OF. 
A LIFETIME OF RESPECT AND EQUAL 
TREATMENT OUGHT TO MEAN 
SOMETHING WHEN ASSESSING 
ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE FLATLY 
INCONSISTENT WITH THE COURSE OF 
A PERSON'S ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. 
WITH THOSE COMMENTS, JUDGE, I'D 
LIKE TO ASK IF YOU QUESTIONS, 
IF I CAN. 
AND, IF YOU CAN BE SHORT IN 
YOUR ANSWERS IT WOULD HELP ME 
GET THROUGH A BUNCH OF THEM. 
IT'S ABOUT HOW THIS PROCESS HAS 
UNFOLDED. 
WHEN DID YOU FIRST LEARNED OF 
DR. FORD'S ALLEGATIONS AGAINST 
YOU? 
>> IT WAS A WEEK AGO SUNDAY 
WHEN THE WASHINGTON POST STORY. 
>> ISN'T THAT AMAZING? 
DID THE RANKING MEMBER RAISES 
ALLEGATIONS IN YOUR ONE-ON-ONE 
MEETING WITH HER LAST MONTH? 
>> SHE DID NOT. 
EXPECTED THE RANKING MEMBER 
RAISE THEM AT YOUR PUBLIC 
HEARING EARLIER THIS MONTH? 
>> NO. 
>> TO THE RANKING MEMBER RAISE 
THEM AT THE CLOSED SESSION THAT 
FOLLOWED THE PUBLIC HEARING? 
>> SHE WAS NOT THERE. 
EXPECTED THE RANKING MEMBER OR 
ANY OF HER COLLEAGUES RAISE THEM
IN THE 1300 WRITTEN QUESTIONS 
THAT WERE SUBMITTED TO YOU 
FOLLOWING THE HEARING? 
>> NO. 
>> ONE WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT 
THE RANKING MEMBER AND HER 
STAFF ASKED YOU ABOUT THESE 
ALLEGATIONS? 
>> TODAY. 
>> WHEN DID YOU FIRST HEAR OF 
THE ALLEGATIONS FROM DEBORAH 
RAMIREZ AGAINST YOU? 
>> IN THE LAST PERIOD SINCE 
THEN, IN THE NEW YORKER STORY. 
>> TO THE RANKING MEMBER OR ANY 
OF HER COLLEAGUES OR STAFF 
ASKED ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS 
FROM MS. RAMIREZ BEFORE THEY 
WERE LEAKED TO THE PRESS? 
>> NO. 
>> ONE WAS THE FIRST TIME THE 
RANKING MEMBER OR ANY OF HER 
COLLEAGUES OR ANY OF THEIR 
STAFF ASKED YOU ABOUT MS. 
RAMIREZ'S ALLEGATIONS? 
>> TODAY. 
>> I THINK IT'S A DISGRACE. 
>> SENATOR 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, TODAY'S 
HEARING IS ABOUT DR. FORD'S 
SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS ABOUT 
SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
YOU HAVE UNEQUIVOCALLY DENIED 
THOSE CLAIMS. 
WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ASSESS HER 
CREDIBILITY AND YOURS. 
AND, IN OUR PREVIOUS VIGOROUS 
EXCHANGES AND PREVIOUS 
CONFIRMATION HEARING ROUNDS, I 
FOUND THAT YOUR ANSWERS, AT 
TIMES, VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED BUT 
OTHER TIMES STRUCK ME AS 
EVASIVE OR NOT CREDIBLE ON KEY 
ISSUES. 
IT'S AGAINST THAT BACKDROP THAT 
I SEEK TO ASSESS YOUR 
CREDIBILITY TODAY. 
YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING THAT 
RULE OF LAW MEANS TAKING 
ALLEGATIONS SERIOUSLY AND I 
AGREE WITH THAT. 
IT BRINGS ME NO JOY TO QUESTION 
YOU ON THESE TOPICS TODAY BUT I 
DO THINK THEY ARE SERIOUS AND I 
THINK THEY ARE WORTHY OF OUR 
ATTENTION. 
SO, LET ME, IF I CAN, RETURN TO 
A LINE OF QUESTIONING MY 
COLLEAGUE WAS ON BEFORE. 
IT WAS ABOUT WHETHER YOU'VE 
EVER GOTTEN AGGRESSIVE WHILE 
DRINKING OUR FORGOTTEN AN 
EVENING AFTER DRINKING. 
>> THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT 
QUESTIONS. 
I'VE ALREADY ANSWERED THE 
SECOND ONE. 
AS TO THE FIRST, I THINK THE 
ANSWER TO THAT IS BASICALLY, 
NO. I 
DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN 
BY THAT. 
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? 
>> WELL, THE REASON -- 
>> I DON'T MEAN IT THAT WAY. 
BUT, NO IS THE BASIC ANSWER 
UNLESS YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 
SOMETHING THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF 
THAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK 
ABOUT. 
>> THE REASON I'M ASKING -- 
WE'VE HAD A BRIEF PERIOD OF 
TIME TO WAY OUTSIDE EVIDENCE 
AND I WILL JOIN MY COLLEAGUES 
IN SAYING THAT I WISH WE HAD 
MORE EVIDENCE IN FRONT OF US 
TODAY. 
DO YOU REMEMBER LIZ SWISHER, A 
COLLEGE CLASSMATE FROM YALE? 
>> FIRST YOUR POINT ABOUT 
OUTSIDE EVIDENCE, ALL FOUR 
WITNESSES -- 
>> I'M TRYING TO GET THIS 
QUESTION -- 
>> YOU MADE A POINT AND I JUST 
WANT TO EMPHASIZE. 
ALL FOUR IT WITNESSES WHO WERE 
ALLEGEDLY AT THE EVENT HAVE 
SAID IT DIDN'T HAPPEN INCLUDING 
DR. FORD'S LONGTIME FRIEND, 
LELAND KEISER. 
>> IF MARK JUDGE WERE IN FRONT 
OF US, WE COULD ASSESS HIS 
CREDIBILITY. 
LET ME GET THROUGH THIS, IF I 
CAN, YOUR HONOR. 
LIZ SWISHER IS A COLLEGE 
CLASSMATE AND NOW A MEDICAL 
DOCTOR. 
I'M QUOTING FROM A RECENT 
INTERVIEW SHE GAVE. 
SHE SAID BRETT KAVANAUGH DRANK 
MORE THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE. 
HE DID END UP SLURRING HIS 
WORDS, AND STUMBLING. 
IT'S NOT CREDIBLE FOR HIM TO 
SAY HE'S HAD NO MEMORY LAPSES 
ON THE NIGHT HE DRANK TO 
EXCESS. I 
KNOW BECAUSE I DRINK WITH HIM. 
HOW SHOULD WE ASSESS THAT? 
>> SHE THEN GOES ON, IF YOU 
KEPT READING AND SAYS SHE 
ACTUALLY CAN'T POINT TO ANY 
SPECIFIC INSTANCE LIKE THAT. 
>> THE QUOTE THAT JUMPED OUT AT 
ME WAS BRETT WAS A SLOPPY DRUNK 
AND I KNOW BECAUSE I DRINK WITH 
HIM. 
>> I DON'T -- I DO NOT THINK 
THAT IS A FAIR CHARACTERIZATION 
AND CHRIS DUDLEY IS QUOTED IN 
THAT ARTICLE. I 
WOULD REFER YOU TO WHAT CHRIS 
DUDLEY SAID. 
I SPENT MORE TIME WITH CHRIS 
DUDLEY IN COLLEGE THAN JUST 
ABOUT ANYONE AND I REFER YOU TO 
WHAT HE SAID. 
>> AND OTHER REPORTING, AS I'M 
SURE YOU KNOW, A COLLEGE 
CLASSMATE DESCRIBED YOU AS 
RELATIVELY SHY BUT SAID WHEN 
YOU'RE DRANK YOU COULD BE 
AGGRESSIVE OR EVEN BELLIGERENT. 
YOUR ROOMMATE, AS YOU DISCUSS 
WITH SENATOR KLOBUCHAR SAID YOU 
WERE FREQUENTLY DRUNK. 
>> THAT ROOMMATE -- THAT WAS 
FRESHMAN YEAR ROOMMATE -- THERE 
WAS CONTENTION BETWEEN HIM AND 
THE THIRD PERSON. 
THERE WERE THREE OF US IN A 
SMALL ROOM AND YOU SHOULD LOOK 
AT WHAT I SAID IN THE REDACTED 
PORTION OF THE TRANSCRIPT ABOUT 
HIM AND YOU SHOULD ASSESS HIS 
CREDIBILITY WITH THAT IN MIND. 
>> PUT YOURSELF IN OUR SHOES 
FOR A MOMENT, IF YOU WHAT, 
JUDGE. I 
KNOW THAT'S ASKING A LOT OF YOU 
IN THIS SETTING. 
SUPPOSE YOU HAD GONE THROUGH A 
PROCESS TO SELECT SOMEONE FOR 
AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT JOB AND 
A POSITION WHERE YOU HAD A LOT 
OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AND AS 
HE FINISHED THE HIRING PROCESS, 
YOU LEARN OF A CREDIBLE 
ALLEGATION THAT, IF TRUE, WOULD 
BE DISQUALIFYING. 
WOULD YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND 
TAKE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OR 
MOVE TO A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE? 
WHY NOT AGREE TO A ONE-WEEK 
PAUSE TO ALLOW THE FBI TO 
INVESTIGATE ALL THESE 
ALLEGATIONS AND ALLOW YOU AN 
OPPORTUNITY A WEEK FROM NOW TO 
HAVE THE FOLKS PRESENT IN FRONT 
OF US FOR US TO ASSESS THEIR 
CREDIBILITY AND FOR US TO 
EITHER CLEAR YOUR NAME OR 
RESOLVE THESE ALLEGATIONS BY 
MOVING TO A DIFFERENT NOMINEE? 
>> ALL FOUR WITNESSES WHO WERE 
ALLEGED TO BE AT THE EVENT SAID 
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN INCLUDING DR. 
FORD'S LONGTIME FRIEND, MS. 
LELAND KEYSER WHO SAID SHE 
DIDN'T KNOW ME AND THAT SHE 
DOES NOT RECALL EVER BEING AT A 
PARTY WITH ME WITH OR WITHOUT 
DR. FORD. 
>> WHAT I STRUGGLED WITH, JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, IS THE ABSENCE OF 
FAIR FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
DRIVEN NONPARTISAN PROCESS TO 
QUESTION THE VARIOUS PEOPLE WHO 
I THINK ARE CRITICAL TO THIS. 
MY CONCERN, SHOULD YOU MOVE 
FORWARD, IS WHAT IT WILL DO TO 
THE CREDIBILITY OF THE COURT 
AND HOW THAT MAY WELL HANG OVER 
YOUR SERVICE. 
I UNDERSTAND -- >> SIR, MY 
REPUTATION -- >> AND CALLING 
FOR THE FBI INVESTIGATION FOR 
ONE WEEK, TO CLEAR OR CONFIRM 
SOME OF THESE ALLEGATIONS. 
>> WHEN YOU SAY A WEAK DELAY, 
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG THE LAST 
10 DAYS HAVE BEEN FOR US? 
>> PROBABLY AN ETERNITY. 
>> FOR US, EVERY DAY -- 
>> EVERY DAY HAS BEEN A 
LIFETIME. 
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN 
INVESTIGATED AND ALL FOUR 
WITNESSES SAY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN 
AND THEY'VE SAID IT UNDER 
PENALTY OF FELONY. 
I'VE PRODUCED MY CALENDARS, 
WHICH SHOW A LOT. 
THAT'S IMPORTANT EVIDENCE. 
YOU ACT LIKE -- I MEAN -- THE 
LAST 10 DAYS -- I ASKED FOR A 
HEARING THE DAY AFTER THE 
ALLEGATION. 
>> BEFORE I CALL ON SENATOR 
LEE, I WANT TO EMPHASIZE 
SOMETHING HERE. 
TALKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING 
WITHOUT ENOUGH TIME -- WE HAD 
45 DAYS BETWEEN JULY 30 AND 
SEPTEMBER 13, I BELIEVE IT IS, 
WHEN WE COULD HAVE BEEN 
INVESTIGATING THIS. IN REGARD 
TO THIS CANDIDATE, IF YOU TAKE 
THE AVERAGE OF 65-70 DAYS 
BETWEEN THE TIME THAT A PERSON 
IS ANNOUNCED BY THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE SENATE VOTES ON IT, 
IT'S ABOUT 65-70 DAYS AND HERE 
WE ARE AT 85-90 DAYS. 
THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME PUT IN 
ON THIS NOMINATION. 
SENATOR LEE? 
WAIT A MINUTE. I 
HAVE ONE OTHER THING. 
EVERYBODY ELSE HAS BEEN PUTTING 
LETTERS IN THE RECORD. 
I HAVE A LETTER HERE FROM 65 
WOMEN WHO KNEW JUDGE KAVANAUGH 
BETWEEN THE YEARS 1979 AND 1983,
THE YEARS HE ATTENDED 
GEORGETOWN PREP HIGH SCHOOL. 
THESE WOMEN WROTE TO THE 
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THEY KNOW 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND THEY KNOW 
THAT THE ALLEGATIONS RAISED BY 
DR. FORD ARE COMPLETELY, 
TOTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH HIS 
CHARACTER. 
THESE 65 WOMEN KNOW HIM THROUGH 
SOCIAL EVENTS AND CHURCH AND 
MANY HAVE REMAINED CLOSE 
FRIENDS WITH HIM. 
HERE'S WHAT THEY SAY, PARTLY 
QUOTING THE LETTER. 
, QUOTE, THROUGH THE MORE THAN 
35 YEARS WE'VE KNOWN HIM, BRETT 
HAS STOOD OUT FOR HIS 
FRIENDSHIP, CHARACTER AND 
INTEGRITY. 
HE HAS ALWAYS TREATED WOMEN 
WITH DECENCY AND RESPECT. 
THAT WAS TRUE IN HIGH SCHOOL 
AND REMAINS TRUE TO THIS DAY. 
IN CLOSING, THEY WROTE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH, QUOTE, HAS ALWAYS 
BEEN A GOOD PERSON. 
WITHOUT OBJECTION, I PUT IT IN 
THE RECORD. 
SENATOR LEE? 
>> JUDGE KAVANAUGH, YOU'VE BEEN 
COOPERATIVE AT EVERY STAGE OF 
THE INVESTIGATION, THE 
BACKGROUND AND THE 
INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE 
COMMITTEE. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> YES. 
>> IT'S ALSO CORRECT THAT YOU 
DO NOT CONTROL THE FBI OR WHEN 
IT CONDUCTS AN INVESTIGATION. 
YOU ARE A NOMINEE, NOT TASKED 
WITH THE JOB OF DECIDING WHO 
AND HOW AN INVESTIGATION WILL 
BE CONDUCTED? 
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 
>> IN EVERY MOMENT WHEN WE OR 
PRIOR TO THE JURISDICTION, THE 
FBI HAS ASKED YOU QUESTIONS, 
YOU'VE BEEN ATTENTIVE AND 
RESPONSIVE, ISN'T THAT RIGHT? 
>> THAT'S CORRECT, THROUGHOUT 
MY CAREER. 
>> I HAVE COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE 
REPEATEDLY ASKED FOR AN FBI 
INVESTIGATION AND THERE ARE 
SOME IRONIES IN THIS. 
IRONIES THAT I'VE SAID ARE AT 
AT LEAST TWO LEVELS. 
AND THE FIRST PLACE, AT LEAST 
ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES, AT LEAST 
ONE OF THEM, HAD ACCESS TO THIS 
INFORMATION MANY, MANY WEEKS 
BEFORE ANYONE ELSE DID. 
HAD THE ABILITY AND I BELIEVE 
THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO REPORT 
THOSE FACTS TO THE FBI. 
AT THAT POINT, THEY COULD HAVE 
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN 
INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI AND IT 
COULD'VE BEEN HANDLED IN SUCH A 
WAY THAT DIDN'T TURN THIS INTO 
A CIRCUS, ONE THAT TURNED YOUR 
LIFE UPSIDE DOWN AND THAT OF 
YOUR FAMILY AND THE LIFE OF DR. 
FORD AND HER FAMILY -- UPSIDE 
DOWN. I 
CONSIDER THIS MOST UNFORTUNATE 
GIVEN THAT IT'S ENTIRELY WITHIN 
THE CONTROL OF AT LEAST ONE OF 
MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES TO DO 
THIS. 
THE SECOND LEVEL OF IRONY HERE 
IS THAT WHILE CALLING 
REPEATEDLY FOR AN INVESTIGATION 
BY THE FBI, AND INVESTIGATION 
OVER WHICH YOU HAVE NO ABILITY 
TO CONTROL, BY THE WAY, AND 
INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE NO 
AUTHORITY TO CALL FOR -- WE ARE 
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONVERSATION 
THAT INVOLVES QUESTIONS TO YOU. 
I ASKED MY DEMOCRATIC 
COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE TWO 
QUESTIONS FOR JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
ASK HIM. 
HE'S RIGHT HERE. 
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT IS THE 
TRUTH, ASK HIM QUESTIONS RIGHT 
NOW. 
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OF OTHER 
WITNESSES, FOR THE LOVE THAT IS 
SACRED AND HOLY, PARTICIPATE IN 
THE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIONS 
THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON AS YOU 
HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICIPATING. 
WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF 
INVESTIGATING THE OUTSIDE 
WITNESSES, IF SOMEONE WERE 
INTERESTED IN THE TRUTH, THIS 
IS WHAT THEY WOULD DO. 
THEY WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THE 
INVESTIGATION AND WHEN WE HAVE 
A COMMITTEE INVESTIGATION, A 
COMMITTEE HEARING WITH LIVE 
WITNESSES, THEY WOULD TALK 
ABOUT THAT RATHER THAN 
SOMETHING ELSE THEY WISHED THEY 
WERE HAVING IN FRONT OF THEM. 
IF WHAT THEY WANT IS A SEARCH 
FOR THE TRUTH, THEN NOW IS THE 
CHOICE. 
ON THE OTHER HAND, IF WHAT THEY 
WANT TO DO IS DELAY THIS UNTIL 
AFTER THE ELECTION, WHICH AT 
LEAST ONE OF MY ELECTION 
COLLATE -- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES 
HAS ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT MIGHT BE 
WHAT THEY WOULD DO. 
FINALLY, I WANT TO POINT OUT 
THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT 
PRECEDENT FROM OUR FORMER 
CHAIRMAN OF THIS COMMITTEE, 
CHAIRMAN JOE BIDEN. 
DURING THE CLARENCE THOMAS 
HEARINGS, NEARLY THREE DECADES 
AGO, CHAIRMAN BIDEN MADE SOME 
INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS ABOUT 
FBI REPORTS AND THEIR ROLE IN 
THIS PROCESS. 
HE SAID, QUOTE, THE NEXT PERSON 
WHO REFERS TO THE FBI REPORT AS 
BEING WORTH ANYTHING, OBVIOUSLY 
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING. 
THE FBI EXPLICITLY DOES NOT IN 
THIS OR ANY OTHER CASE REACH A 
CONCLUSION, PERIOD. 
THOSE ARE HIS COMMENTS, NOT 
MINE. 
THE REASON WE CANNOT RELY ON 
THE FBI REPORT, YOU WOULD NOT 
LIKE IT IF WE DID. 
BECAUSE, IT IS INCONCLUSIVE. 
WHEN PEOPLE WAIVE AND FBI 
REPORT BEFORE YOU, UNDERSTAND 
THEY DO NOT, THEY DO NOT REACH 
CONCLUSIONS. 
THEY DO NOT MAKE -- AS MY 
FRIEND POINTS OUT MORE 
ACCURATELY -- THEY DO NOT MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
IN OTHER WORDS, THE ROLE OF THE 
FBI IS TO FLAKE ISSUES AND 
THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN FLAGGED. 
SAID THE, IN THIS CASE, THEY 
WERE NOT FLAGGED AS THEY SHOULD 
HAVE BEEN OR THE TIMING THEY 
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THEREFORE, 
THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN 
ADDRESSED IN THE MANNER THAT 
WOULD'VE PRESERVED A LOT MORE 
DIGNITY FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY AND
DR. FORD AND HER FAMILY. 
THEY WERE INSTEAD, HELD OUT 
UNTIL THE FINAL MOMENT. I 
CONSIDER THAT MOST UNFORTUNATE. 
FOR THAT, ON BEHALF OF THIS 
COMMITTEE, I EXTEND TO MY MOST 
PROFOUND SYMPATHIES. 
AND, MY MOST PROFOUND 
SYMPATHIES TO DR. FORD AND HER 
FAMILY, AS WELL. 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, SINCE WE DON'T 
HAVE ENOUGH SLOTS, CAN I HAVE 
THE LAST MINUTE OR -- THE LAST 
MINUTE OF SENATOR LEE? 
JUDGE, WE DID 38 HOURS IN 
PUBLIC WITH YOU. 
DID WE HAVE ANY PRIVATE 
HEARINGS WITH YOU? 
>> YES. 
>> WAS AT A FUN TIME FOR YOU 
WHEN SENATORS COULD ASK 
QUESTIONS THAT WERE AWKWARD OR 
UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT POTENTIAL 
ALCOHOLISM, GAMBLING ADDICTION, 
CREDIT CARD DEBT? IF BUDDIES 
FLOATED MONEY TO BUY BASEBALL 
TICKETS? 
DID YOU ENJOY THE TIME WE SPENT 
LATE ONE NIGHT? 
>> I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO 
COOPERATE WITH THE COMMITTEE. 
>> THAT'S CHARITABLE. 
WERE YOU EVER ASKED ABOUT ANY 
SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS WHEN WE HAD 
THAT TIME WITH YOU ALONE? 
>> NO. 
INSPECTED THE RANKING MEMBER 
ALREADY HAVE THESE ALLEGATIONS 
FOR -- THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN 
SEPTEMBER 6TH OR SEPTEMBER 7TH 
AND THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN JULY 
30TH. 
IT WAS A RECOMMENDATION THAT 
WAS MADE BY THE RANKING MEMBER 
OR HER STAFF TO DR. FORD? 
BY THE WAY, I THINK DR. FORD IS 
A VICTIM AND I THINK SHE'S BEEN 
THROUGH HECK. 
I'M VERY SYMPATHETIC TO HER. 
BUT, DID THE RANKING MEMBER'S 
STAFF MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO 
HIRE A LAWYER AND SHE KNEW ALL 
OF THAT AND YET WE HAD A 
HEARING HERE WITH YOU AND NONE 
OF THESE THINGS WERE ASKED? 
WHEN THE PROCESS WAS CLOSED, 
AND WHEN WE WERE DONE MEETING 
IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, THIS WAS 
SPRUNG ON YOU? I 
WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE THE 
DATES CORRECT. 
WE'VE GOT 35 PLUS DAYS FROM ALL 
THE TIME THAT THIS EVIDENCE WAS 
IN THE HANDS, RECOMMENDATIONS 
WERE MADE TO AN OUTSIDE LAWYER 
AND YOU COULD HAVE HANDLED THIS 
AND WE COULD'VE HAD THIS 
CONVERSATION IN PRIVATE IN A 
WAY THAT DIDN'T DO CRAP TO HIS 
FAMILY BUT -- I YIELD MY TIME. 
TRYING TO SEE IF HE COULD DO 
MATH ABOUT 35 DAYS. 
THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A 
QUESTION. 
>> THANKS, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
AN AFTERNOON JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
AS A FEDERAL JUDGE, YOU ARE 
AWARE OF THE JURY INSTRUCTION, 
ARE YOU NOT? 
YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT JURY 
INSTRUCTION? 
YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEANS? 
>> YOU CAN TRANSLATE IT BETTER 
THAN I CAN. 
FALLS IN ONE THING, FALLS IN 
EVERYTHING. 
SOME OF US HAVE HEARD MANY 
TIMES, IS TO TELL THE JURY THEY 
CAN DISBELIEVE A WITNESS IF 
THEY FIND HIM TO BE FALSE IN 
ONE THING, AND THE CORE OF WHY 
WE ARE HERE TODAY REALLY IS 
CREDIBILITY. 
>> THE CORE OF WHY WE ARE HERE 
IS AN ALLEGATION FOR WHICH THE 
FOUR WITNESSES PRESENT HAVE ALL 
SAID IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT RENATE 
DOLPHIN WHO LIVES IN 
CONNECTICUT. 
SHE THOUGHT THESE YEARBOOK 
STATEMENTS WERE, QUOTE, 
HORRIBLE, HURTFUL AND SIMPLY 
UNTRUE. 
BECAUSE, RENATE ALUMNI CLEARLY 
IMPLIED A BOAST OF SEXUAL 
CONQUEST AND THAT IS THE REASON 
YOU APOLOGIZED TO HER, CORRECT? 
>> THAT'S FALSE. SPEAKING ABOUT 
THE YEARBOOK, SHE SAID SHE AND 
I NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 
INTERACTIONS. 
>> THE QUESTION IS FALSE AND I 
ADDRESSED THAT IN THE OPENING 
STATEMENT. 
SO, YOUR QUESTION IS BASED ON A 
FALSE PREMISE AND REALLY DOES 
GREAT HARM TO HER. 
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ARE 
BRINGING THIS UP, FRANKLY. 
YOU ARE DOING GREAT HARM TO HER 
BY BRINGING HER NAME APPEAR. 
IT'S REALLY UNFORTUNATE. 
>> CALLING SOMEONE AN ALUMNUS 
IN THAT WAY -- 
>> IMPLYING WHAT YOU ARE 
APPLYING -- 
>> BY A NUMBER OF YOUR FOOTBALL 
FRIENDS, AT THE TIME, IS 
BOASTING OF SEXUAL CONQUEST. 
THAT'S THE REASON I'M BRINGING 
IT UP. 
>> IT'S FALSE. 
YOU ARE APPLYING IT. 
LOOK WHAT YOU ARE BRINGING UP 
ABOUT HER. 
LOOK WHAT YOU ARE DOING. 
YOU BRING HER NAME UP. 
>> DON'T SUBTRACT FROM MY TIME. 
>> ASK YOUR QUESTION -- 
>> SHE'S A GREAT PERSON. 
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN A GREAT 
PERSON. 
WE NEVER HAD ANY SEXUAL 
INTERACTION. 
BY BRINGING THIS UP, YOU ARE 
JUST DRAGGING HER THROUGH THE 
MUD. 
IT'S JUST UNNECESSARY. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
YOU'VE MADE REFERENCE, JUDGE, TO
A SWORN STATEMENT, I BELIEVE, 
BY MARK JUDGE TO THE COMMITTEE. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> I MADE REFERENCE TO WHAT 
MARK JUDGE'S LAWYER SENT TO THE 
MITIGATE -- SENT TO THE 
COMMITTEE? 
>> IT'S NOT A SWORN STATEMENT, 
IS IT? 
>> UNDER PENALTY OF PENALTY -- 
PENALTY A FELONY? 
>> IT'S SIGNED BY HIS LAWYER, 
BARBARA VAN GELDER. 
IT IS SIX CURSORY AND 
CONCLUSION SENTENCES. 
ARE YOU SAYING THAT IS A 
SUBSTITUTE FOR AN INVESTIGATION 
BY THE FBI? 
OR SOME INTERVIEW BY THE FBI 
UNDER OATH? 
>> UNDER PENALTY OF FELONY, HE 
SAID THAT THIS KIND OF EVENT 
DIDN'T HAPPEN AND THAT I NEVER 
DID OR WOULD HAVE DONE 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. 
>> IS A FEDERAL JUDGE, YOU 
ALWAYS WANT THE BEST EVIDENCE, 
DON'T YOU? 
>> SENATOR, HE HAS SAID IN ALL 
THE WITNESSES PRESENT -- LOOK 
AT THE STATEMENT FROM MS. 
KEYSER. 
>> LET ME MOVE ON TO ANOTHER 
TOPIC. 
YOU TESTIFY TO THIS COMMITTEE 
THIS MORNING, THIS AFTERNOON -- 
THIS HOLE 2-WEEK EFFORT HAS 
BEEN A CALCULATED AND 
ORCHESTRATED POLITICAL HIT 
FUELED WITH APPARENT PENT-UP 
ANGER ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND 
THE 2016 ELECTION, FEAR THAT 
HAS BEEN UNFAIRLY STOKED ABOUT 
MY JUDICIAL RECORD. REVENGE ON 
BEHALF OF THE CLINTONS AND 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MONEY 
FROM OUTSIDE LEFT-WING 
OPPOSITION GROUPS. 
IS IT YOUR TESTIMONY THAT THE 
MOTIVATION OF THE COURAGEOUS 
WOMAN WHO SAT WHERE YOU DID 
JUST A SHORT TIME AGO WAS 
REVENGE ON BEHALF OF A LEFT-
WING CONSPIRACY OR THE 
CLINTONS? 
>> SENATOR, I SAID IN MY 
OPENING STATEMENT THAT SHE 
PREFERRED CONFIDENTIALITY AND 
HER CONFIDENTIALITY WAS 
DESTROYED BY THE ACTIONS OF 
THIS COMMITTEE. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS -- IN A 
SPEECH THAT YOU GAVE AT YALE, 
YOU DESCRIBED, QUOTE, FALLING 
OUT OF THE BUS ONTO THE FRONT 
STEPS OF THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AT 
4:45 A.M. 
>> I WASN'T DESCRIBING ME. 
SENATOR, LET ME FINISH, PLEASE. 
I ORGANIZED A THIRD-YEAR END OF 
SCHOOL PARTY FOR 30 OF MY 
CLASSMATES TO RENT A BUS TO GO 
TO FENWAY PARK IN BOSTON, ABOUT 
A THREE HOUR TRIP. I 
BOUGHT ALL THE TICKETS. 
YOU AND I DISCUSSED THAT 
BEFORE. 
I BOUGHT ALL THE TICKETS, 
RENTED THE BUS AND ORGANIZED 
THE WHOLE TRIP. 
WE WENT TO FENWAY PARK. 
ROGER CLEMENS WAS PITCHING FOR 
THE RED SOX AND WE HAD A GREAT 
TIME. 
GEORGE BRETT WAS PLAYING THIRD 
BASE FOR THE ROYALS, LEFT FIELD 
THAT NIGHT. 
WE WENT TO THE GAME AND GOT 
BACK AND THEN WE WENT OUT. 
IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT OF 
FRIENDSHIP. 
>> I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING 
BUT I NEED TO FINISH THE QUOTE 
BEFORE ASKING THE QUESTION. 
THE QUOTE IS THAT YOU TRIED TO, 
QUOTE,  PIECE THINGS BACK  
TOGETHER, TO RECALL WHAT 
HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. 
>> I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 
>> WELL YOU -- 
>> JUDGE, WILL YOU QUICKLY 
ANSWER A QUESTION AND THEN I'M 
GOING TO LET HIM ANSWER. 
>> I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. 
>> I'VE FINISHED AND SING -- 
ANSWERING MY QUESTION. 
DIDN'T IT AND IMPLY YOU HAD TO 
PIECE THINGS BACK TOGETHER FOR 
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT? 
>> YOU TAKE YOUR TIME AND 
ANSWER THE QUESTION. 
>> DEFINITELY NOT. 
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. 
IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT OF FUN AND 
I WAS SO HAPPY, GREAT 
CAMARADERIE AND EVERYBODY LOOKS 
BACK FONDLY ON THE TRIP TO 
FENWAY PARK AND THEN WE WENT 
OUT TOGETHER AND I KNOW EXACTLY 
WHAT HAPPENED THE WHOLE NIGHT. 
>> DO BELIEVE ANITA HILL? 
>> SENATOR CRAPO? 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH, FIRST, I WANT 
I WANT TO GET INTO THIS WHOLE 
QUESTION THAT'S BEEN BANDIED 
BACK AND FORTH ALMOST ENDLESSLY 
TOAY ABOUT THE FBI 
INVESTIGATION PROCESS. 
I THINK I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON 
WHAT SENATOR LEE AND SENATOR 
SASSE HAVE REFERENCE. 
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK 
ABOUT THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 
IN THESE PROCESSES, WHICH YOU 
HAVE BEEN THROUGH WHEN THE HAVE 
BANNED IS A BACKGROUND CHECK 
WITH REGARD TO A NOMINATION, 
COULD YOU QUICKLY DESCRIBE THAT 
FOR US? 
WHAT DOES THE FBI DO? 
>> THE FBI GATHERS STATEMENTS 
FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
INFORMATION. 
THEY DON'T RESOLVE CREDIBILITY. 
THEY GATHER THE INFORMATION AND 
THE CREDIBILITY DETERMINATION IS
MADE BY THE ALTERNATE 
FACTFINDER. 
IN THIS CASE, THE U.S. SENATE. 
THE COMMITTEE, OF COURSE, IS 
GATHERING EVIDENCE. 
>> THE FBI THEN GIVES THAT 
REPORT TO THE WHITE HOUSE, IF I 
UNDERSTAND IT AND THE WHITE 
HOUSE THEN TRANSFERS IT TO THE 
SENATE. 
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. 
>> AS YOU INDICATED, IT DOES 
NOT -- IT'S BEEN SAID MANY 
TIMES -- THE FBI DOES NOT MAKE 
JUDGMENTS, IT GIVES THE SENATE 
COMMITTEE INFORMATION? 
>> AT THAT POINT IN TIME, IF I 
UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS 
CORRECTLY, THE U.S. SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAS LEGAL 
AUTHORITIES. 
IF IT RECEIVES INFORMATION IN 
THE FBI REPORT THAT IT WANTS TO 
FURTHER INVESTIGATE, THE SENATE 
HAS LEGAL AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT 
FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS. 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. 
>> THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN 
REFERENCED HERE MANY TIMES ABOUT
HOW SOME OF THESE WITNESSES 
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE 
VERY LATE INFORMATION THAT WE 
RECEIVED, HAVE MADE STATEMENTS 
THAT ARE UNDER PENALTY OF 
FELONY. 
THAT'S A FELONY FOR LYING TO 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. 
AS I UNDERSTAND IT, WHAT 
HAPPENS IS THE SENATE JUDICIARY 
COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS AUTHORITY 
UNDER LAW TO CONDUCT THOSE 
KINDS OF INVESTIGATIONS, FOLLOWS
UP ON THE FBI REPORTS TO FINISH 
OUT THE INVESTIGATION THAT IT 
WANTS WITH REGARD TO ANY 
INFORMATION THAT IT RECEIVES 
THAT NEEDS FURTHER 
INVESTIGATION. 
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF 
THE PROCESS? 
>> THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING, 
SENATOR. 
>> IN THIS CASE, AND THERE'S 
BEEN A LOT OF TALK -- IT LOOKS 
LIKE I WILL RUN OUT OF TIME -- 
BUT IN THIS CASE, THERE'S A LOT 
OF CONCERN BY MANY THAT THERE 
WAS NOT SO MUCH IN INTEREST IN 
THE FBI INVESTIGATION AS IT WAS 
IN DELAY. 
I'M NOT GOING TO GET TO THAT 
UNLESS I HAVE TIME. 
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENED IN THE SENATE 
COMMITTEES WITH THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
AS I UNDERSTAND AND IT MAY BE 
MORE OF A QUESTION TO THE 
CHAIRMAN, AS SOON AS WE 
RECEIVED INFORMATION AT 45 DAYS 
AFTER OTHERS ON THE COMMITTEE 
RECEIVED IT, WE CONDUCTED AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
IS THAT CORRECT, MR. CHAIRMAN? 
WE BEGAN THAT LEGAL SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTED 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> THAT INVESTIGATION INVOLVED 
OUR FULLY, LAWFULLY ENABLED 
INVESTIGATORS TO CONDUCT AN 
INVESTIGATION. 
IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY, 
THE DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF THE 
COMMITTEE REFUSED TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THAT 
INVESTIGATION. 
>> YES. 
>> SO, WE HAVE CONDUCTED THE 
INVESTIGATION. 
THE VERY KINDS OF THINGS THAT 
MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE 
ARE ASKING THAT WE TELL THE FBI 
TO DO, THIS COMMITTEE HAS THE 
AUTHORITY TO DO IT AND THIS 
COMMITTEE DOES IT AND THIS 
COMMITTEE HAS DONE IT. 
THERE MAY BE MORE INTERVIEWS 
AND MORE INVESTIGATIONS, BUT 
WHEN YOU, JUDGE KAVANAUGH, HAVE 
REFERENCED THE TESTIMONY THAT 
HAS COME FROM THOSE WHO ARE 
IDENTIFIED AS BEING AT THIS 
EVENT, THE TESTIMONY THAT HAS 
BEEN RECEIVED FROM THEM IS 
INFORMATION RECEIVED PURSUANT 
TO A SENATE COMMITTEE 
INVESTIGATION AND I JUST THINK 
IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR. 
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF BACK-
AND-FORTH THAT WE ARE GETTING 
INFORMATION OR LOOKING AT THIS 
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK INTO 
THE INVESTIGATION OR SEE WHAT 
HAPPENED. 
THE REALITY IS THAT THIS 
COMMITTEE IMMEDIATELY AND 
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED EVERY 
WITNESS THAT HAS BEEN 
IDENTIFIED TO US AND WE HAVE 
STATEMENTS UNDER PENALTY OF 
FELONY FROM THEM. 
SO, I JUST WANT TO CONCLUDE 
WITH THAT. I 
HAVE 45 SECONDS LEFT AND I WANT 
TO ASK ONE QUICK QUESTION. 
AGAIN, ON TIMING. 
YOU HAD A MEETING WITH SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN ON AUGUST 20. 
>> IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING AND 
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
DATE. 
WHAT WAS ESTABLISHED 
HELPED DR. FORD TO RETAIN THE 
LAW FIRM SOMETIME BETWEEN AUGUST
30th AND AUGUST 7. I JUST 
WANTED YOU TO CLARIFY ONE MORE 
TIME. 
YOU HAD TWO WEEKS OR MORE AND 
THE ISSUE WAS NOT RAISED WITH 
YOU. 
>> IN. 
MY TIME IS UP. 
>> WE WILL TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE 
BREAK NOW. 
>>-A BREAK IN THE CABINET 
HEARINGS RIGHT NOW. 
WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. 
WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO THE 
END OF THE EXTRAORDINARY DAY IN 
WASHINGTON AS THE QUESTIONS 
CONTINUE FROM BOTH REPUBLICAN 
AND DEMOCRATIC SENATORS. 
REINTRODUCING THE FOLKS WE HAVE 
WITH US RIGHT NOW. 
WE'RE HERE WITH JOHN DICKERSON. 
IT TO THE LEFT IS RICKY KLEEMAN.
AND ALSO ILLEGAL ANALYST IS 
COVERED THE SUPREME COURT FOR A 
LONG TIME. 
>> I THOUGHT THERE WAS AN 
INTERESTING A CHANGE WAS 
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, WHICH, TO 
JOHN'S POINT, THE DEMOCRATS ARE 
ASKING ABOUT TO THE YEARBOOK AND
WHAT YOU WROTE IN THE YEARBOOK 
AND YOUR DRINKING. 
WITHOUT SAYING WHY. 
WITHOUT SAYING THE CONTEXT FOR 
THAT. 
IF HE'S NOT BEING TRUTHFUL 
ABOUT THAT, WE WANT TO KNOW 
WHAT KIND OF PERSON HE WAS. 
SEE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO 
WOULD DO THIS? 
I THINK IT IS ODD THAT THE 
PERSON WHO MADE THE POINTS, OF 
COURSE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING, TO 
HEAR SENATOR BLUMENTHAL SAY, IF 
YOU WERE TO LIVE AT ONE THING, 
IT SUGGESTS YOU WOULD LIE ABOUT 
A LOT OF THINGS. 
YOU CAN ADMIRE KAVANAUGH'S 
RESTRAINT  ASKING, HOW IS YOUR 
SERVICE IN VIETNAM? 
BECAUSE SENATOR BLUMENTHAL HAS 
NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY TRUTHFUL 
ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS IN HIS 
CAREER. 
IT WAS AN ODD MOMENT. 
THEY WERE DOING WHAT YOU SAID 
THEY NEEDED TO DO, PROBABLY NOT 
THE RIGHT SENATOR TO BE SAYING 
THAT IF YOU LIE ABOUT ONE 
THING, THEN YOU WILL LIE ABOUT 
EVERYTHING ELSE, SINCE YOU 
MISLED ON HIS SERVICE IN 
VIETNAM. 
>> IT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE HAD 
HEARD ANITA HILL BROUGHT UP. 
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL MENTIONED 
IT. 
>> DO YOU BELIEVE HIM? 
HE NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. 
I WAS STRUCK BY TWO THINGS, ONE 
WAS WHICH, BRETT KAVANAUGH 
COMING BACK IN AND AMENDING HIS 
PREVIOUS REMARKS, WHICH WAS 
SAYING TO SENATOR KLOBUCHAR, HE 
REPEATEDLY FIRED BACK AND SAID 
HAVE YOU EVER BLACKED OUT?  
SHE IS THE DAUGHTER OF AN 
ALCOHOLIC. 
AS SHE DESCRIBED. 
SO HE APOLOGIZE FOR DOING THAT. 
THE OTHER THING IS ON THE FBI. 
WHEN HE GETS INTO A PROCESS 
FIGHT, YOU TEND TO LOSE PEOPLE. 
SELF REPUBLICANS IN THIS 
AFTERNOON CAN TALK ABOUT AN 
AGGRIEVED BRETT KAVANAUGH WHO 
HAS HAD HIS FAMILY BROUGHT 
THROUGH THIS AWFUL PROCESS, 
THAT IS THE MORAL AND EMOTIONAL 
ARGUMENT TO RALLY SUPPORTERS. 
THE FBI ARGUMENT IS IN THE 
WEEDS A LITTLE BIT. 
AS YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THIS 
WILL PLAY OUT IN PUBLIC, WHICH 
IS WHERE THIS IS BEING PLAYED, 
I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICANS 
ARE HAPPY TO DEBATE THE FBI ALL 
DAY LONG. 
BECAUSE, AT THE END OF THE DAY, 
PEOPLE CAN'T QUITE FOLLOW IT. 
THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW. 
AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS 
A POLITICAL CONVERSATION WHERE 
PEOPLE HAVE TO DEFEND 
THEMSELVES IN THE POLITICAL 
CONTEXT. 
SO I THINK THAT IS HOW THE FBI 
THING MIGHT WORK OUT. 
>> REIT -- RICKY, LEGALLY 
SPEAKING, WHAT HAS SURPRISED 
MOST ABOUT TODAY, OR FROM WHAT 
WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY? 
>> I THINK WHAT SURPRISED ME 
WAS, I EXPECTED THE DEMOCRATS 
TO HAVE HAD NUMEROUS 
CONVERSATIONS AMONGST THEMSELVES
, THE SENATORS, AND TO HAVE HAD 
AN AGREED-UPON PLAN THAT, WHERE 
ONE SENATOR COULD BUILD UPON 
ANOTHER AND BUILD UPON ANOTHER. 
I KNOW IT IS NOT A COURT OF LAW,
BUT THE THEMES STILL RING TRUE. 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS
WOULD SAY WHEN TRYING TO CASE, 
DID NOT MATTER WHICH SIDE, IS 
WHAT IS YOUR STORY? 
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A STORY THAT 
HAS A BEGINNING, MIDDLE, AND AN 
END. 
WHAT HAPPENED HERE IS THAT THE 
REPUBLICANS HAVE A STORY. 
IT IS ABOUT THE DEMISE OF THE 
CHARACTER, OR THE ATTEMPTED 
DEMISE OF THE CHARACTER, OF 
BRETT KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY. 
AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THEY 
SHOW EMPATHY IS A STORY, WITH 
THE BELIEF THAT SOMETHING 
TERRIBLE HAPPENED TO DR. FORD, 
BUT IT JUST WASN'T BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
THE DEMOCRATS, TO FOLLOW UP ON 
JOHN, THE DEMOCRATS DO NOT HAVE 
A STORY HERE. 
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD. 
WHAT THEY HAVE IS BEATING THIS 
DRUM OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION. 
OCCASIONALLY GOING BACK TO THE 
YEARBOOK OR TO STATEMENTS FROM 
COLLEGE TO TRY TO SHOW THAT 
PERHAPS, BRICK AVENUE -- BRETT 
KAVANAUGH IS LYING. 
THEY HAVE A STORY, THEY'RE JUST 
NOT TELLING IT. 
THE MANNER OF PERSUASION, 
WHETHER IT IS TO THE JURY OR 
THE PUBLIC, IS THAT THE PUBLIC 
MUST RUN WITH YOUR STORY. 
IT DOES NOT WANT TO BE IN THE 
WEEDS. 
WHAT BOTH SIDES HAVE TO BE 
CAUTIOUS ABOUT IS GOING BACK TO 
HIS CHILDHOOD OR TO HIS TEEN 
YEARS IN COLLEGE. 
YOU SELL REPUBLICANS, LIKE 
SENATOR HATCH, SAY THAT I 
CANNOT BELIEVE WE ARE 
RELITIGATING THINGS THAT 
HAPPENED WHEN YOU ARE 16. 
NOT TO SAY THAT THIS WAS NOT A 
SERIOUS ALLEGATION AND IF TRUE, 
OF COURSE, HE SHOULD NOT BE 
CONFIRMED, SO, THEY ARE 
JUGGLING THE ACCUSATION AND THE 
AGE OF THE ACCUSED. 
ON THE FLIPSIDE, YOU CAN SEE 
WHERE DEMOCRATS BRING UP 
CERTAIN INCIDENTS OR YEARBOOK 
CAPTIONS AND BRING UP PEOPLE 
THAT ARE DISPARAGED, MAYBE, IN 
THE YEARBOOK AND YOU SEE JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH FLIP THINGS AROUND 
AND SAY, I DON'T WANT TO DRAG 
THIS PERSON'S NAME BACK IN THE 
MUD, WHY ARE YOU BRINGING HER 
UP RIGHT NOW? 
YOU DIDN'T SEE SENATOR 
BLUMENTHAL COME BACK WITH
