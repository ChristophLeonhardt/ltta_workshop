yesterday was Gay Pride Day for those of you who weren't paying attention or couldn't give a slice of a rat's backside or perhaps had something better to do like picking the little pieces of sock fluff out from between your toes Gay Pride Day is a day when the more irritating sort of homosexuals strut around making a show of themselves which is pretty much like every other day except they all do it in one place oh it ties up traffic Gay Pride Day is traditionally followed by a sloth day gay envy day gay wrath day and gay gluttony day as gays around the country try to indulge in all seven of the deadly sins in hopes of bringing back the good old days when they were regarded as wicked and fascinated fascinating instead of just sort of annoying as gay pride organizer garrulous Vaughn self put it in an interview with a Barbie doll he stole from his sister when he was 10 quote it used to be people considered gays sinful and that gave us the cachet of being naughty and sort of forbidden once we were more or less accepted it turned out we were just a bunch of people who sleep with members of the same sex which when you come to think about it isn't even as interesting as sleeping with the opposite sex which can lead to all sorts of hilarious misunderstandings and complications like a completely new human being coming out of your wife for us it's just sex and then you know that's it so we thought we'd have a parade unquote in fact the entire idea of pride when applied to a group of people like gay pride or black pride or trans pride not only has nothing to do with pride it has nothing to do with being gay or black or trans it's simply a way of roping people into the slavery of leftism by convincing them they're part of a victim group that needs government help and that they can only have pride in themselves by banding together and announcing they have pride in themselves which just by the way doesn't actually work organizers of the LGBT Pride Parade in Los Angeles and Charlotte North Carolina or at least honest enough to admit the leftism by making their parades about attacking Donald Trump the most openly Pro gay person ever to be elected president but the fact is you can go walking around in black skin or dress up and pretend you're the opposite sex or make out with your male friends until he regains consciousness and calls the police without for one second believing that the state should own the fruits of your labor whether its speech should be censored where that centralized government should be involved in every decision you make about everything you can be black or transor gay and be a conservative which is called being self-reliant and free which will give you real pride and then you won't have to have a fake pride parade and tie

Britain it was almost I mean it was almost like the Clavin was abyss in Britain where they had this election and Theresa May thought she was going to increase her dad her majority so it was going to give her some leverage when she went in to negotiate brexit with the EU and instead is she got nailed I mean Jen and all of this you know Americans talk about why this happened it happened for purely local reasons it happened because she wasn't you know she's kind of got no charisma she cut the police force she cut the police force funding and then there were these terrorist attacks I'm not sure how much that had to do it but that she really is not somebody who's the affection of the public and she's not a very good politician it appears so she really got nailed but the thing that is is really it for brexit Mexico sport because they've already filed that article 50 or whatever as I've already said they're leaving they will leave all this stuff about negotiating the soft brexit or hard brexit you shouldn't bother Americans one way or another even if they leave and they have no deal with the EU that you know it's not going to be a disaster it hasn't been a disaster up till now if you think back and remember the way they were talking about this you know set your hair on fire run out into the street screaming this is the worst thing that ever happened turned out wasn't the worst thing never happened at all the economy was fine until Chris election the problem here is Jeremy Corbyn and the problem is the young people voted for man we're going to get back to that later in the program because it really does say something Jeremy Corbyn is he's a loon he's a bad guy he is not just a communist he's an anti Westerner he can sort swith terrorists from the IRA to Latin American terrorists to Hamas and guys like that he's he's awful he's all about like when these terrorists he said we shouldn't shoot the terrorists that's overreacting we just want to settle things peacefully that is how you settle with terrorists you shoot them that is the best possible way to settle things peacefully with the terror sighs this is a bad guy and the fact that people voted for him I mean he doesn't like he kind of is for brexit too because he's on the left he hates the EU but the fact that people voted for him too tells you something about how lost the West is I've talked about this before about the fact that we've lost this consensus that we had after the war we're liking this zero gravity room with all the furniture floating around we don't know where it's going to land and that's what's affecting us here to why so many people are so angry and so many people don't eat they don't even understand this is kind of part of what I want to talk about they don't even understand the basics the basis of their own philosophy so they just know they're angry when somebody disagrees with them but before we look at Britain let's go back and look at some of the stuff we were talking about before as the week ended and descended into the horrifying clayvin this weekend I'm not even sure how many of you are still with us survived the Caligula's weekend but i want to talk about some of the ramifications of chromis testimony that are still going on today as people are kind of sorting through it you know the thing about Kobe's testimony is it really brought out more than anything for me the the disparity between the way Trump and his Justice Department is treated and the way Obama is Justice Department was treated because Obama's Justice Department and now seems clear from stuff that came out last week in stuff that Comey said it now seems absolutely clear that this was a tremendous tremendously corrupt Chicago machine that Obama was running and he really ran Washington DC on the bay on the basis of Chicago machine politics so here's you know you remember that one of the things we learned as Comey said that Loretta Lynch and we always called her the blandly corrupt Attorney General Loretta Lynch because she always had that bland way of explaining things to you like she was mommy when she was saying things that were subtly corrupt you know and so Comey sat down and he said that Loretta Lynch the only time he ever took notes with anybody was just with tropica struct and so bad so evil so dishonest but Loretta Lynch called them in and told them during the Hillary Clinton campaign not to call the investigation into Hillary Clinton investigation to call it a matter and listen to louie gohmert reactor this is cup number three Louie Gohmert really understands why this is such a bad thing as a former prosecutor judge in Chief Justice I can tell you credibility is always relevant it's always material and when Comey said he took a memo of what the president said because he was afraid of what he might do in the future whereas you have the Attorney General herself basically telling him to lie she knew it was a criminal investigation the FBI is not allowed to look into matters it's got to be an investigation there's got to be a criminal probe that they're getting into otherwise they have no business getting into fishing expeditions or fishing matters so he totally ruined his own credibility what was left of it he did vast damage and raised big red flags and questions over a Loretta Lynch's job as head of the Justice Department she was using her official position to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton and that didn't seem to bother him enough to bring a memo on top of this by the way on top of this Comey revealed what to me was his own corruption by saying that he leaked his memos to the press he leaked the memos to the press hoping to get a special counsel appointed and remember that I said when they appointed a special counsel this was the biggest mistake they made because the GOP panics when the press gets hysterical and if we had just stayed calm if people have just stayed calm I was making jokes about it on the show and people were calling me out and saying how can you say be calm how can you leave why are you why are you fronting for Donald Trump and had nothing to do with that I just knew there was no there there there was no collusion that now everybody admits there was no collusion Comey himself says there was no investigation into Trump there was no need for special counsel now Comey has maneuvered the special counsel by leaking and Newt Gingrich is the only guy I mean he's not the only guy who said it but he really came out and said he sent the tweet here's chris wallace and talking to newt gingrich and chris wallace starts out by reading the tweet that newt gingrich put out saying that the special counsel robert muller is now is entertain 'td right because robert muller is james commis friend and now we know that the reason that he was appointed had something to do a lot to do with this leaked memo so it was all it was all maneuvered by Comey and he got his friend appointed here's newt gingrich reacting chris cuomo chris wallace starts by reading history republicans need to focus on closing down independent counsel because it clearly isn't independent what's your reasoning and wouldn't that really look like an obstruction of justice well first of all I thought Comey said Comey said I deliberately leaked through an intermediary to get to create this counsel who happens to be one of his closest friends then look at who Miller is starting to hire I mean these are people that frankly look look to me like they're they're setting up to go after Trump they're including people by the way who have been reprimanded for hiding from the Defense Information in two major cases I think this this is going to be a witch-hunt I think it called me himself by his own testimony tainted this particular process you have a director the FBI deliberately leaking in order to create a special counsel who we're now supposed to believe is going to be this neutral figure I think that's just nonsense so you heard it here when they appointed this guy so the problem is he can't fire him because it does look like obstruction of justice even though it's not me look none of this is obstruction of justice as you know Trump can fire call me any day he can fire Comey a you day he wants for whatever you can fire him for chewing gum for picking his toes in Poughkeepsie whatever he wants that's how you can fire him that's not obstructing justice but now he's got this dogged investigator on his tail with a brief from Comey basically saying get this guy for firing me and that's essentially what happened and he can't fire him it was a big big mistake and it's all about the press listen for a moment of accidental honesty from John King of CNN okay when he's reacting to the testimony about Loretta Lynch listen listen to what he says carefully number of significant things one this won't get most attention because it's in the rearview mirror but a pretty damning account from Jim Comey there about Loretta Lynch the former attorney general in the Obama administration and her handling of the Clinton email investigation and won't get much attention but that was pretty damning number two he said that the adrenaline told him don't call it an investigator matter all in a matter not a matter and he said he was confused by that and concerned by that so synthases the way the press always talks it's not going to get much attention now translate that into honest and it's we are not going to pay attention to this we are not going to pay attention we're going to sweep this under the rug a rare moment of honesty on CNN hey I got to say goodbye to Facebook and YouTube which means you if you're on Facebook and YouTube have to come on over to the daily wire.com
