1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
hey everyone let's put the bullet

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,090
there's not waste time today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,890
my foundation routine you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have asked I</font>

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,690
have delivered there is a clause<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,490
little foundation plan now and don't

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,110
actually use foundation well that's like

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,610
I do use foundation but don't use<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">foundation I use concealer actually any</font>

9
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,480
foundation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using a foundation in</font>

10
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,859
this video yeah one because I've just

11
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">failed to find a foundation i really</font>

12
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,220
love and two because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kind of like the</font>

13
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,500
way this routine hydrates my skin but

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">stops it from looking too fake</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

15
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,039
taking all the dimensions out of it it

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,060
means even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though it only takes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

17
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,109
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> out five minutes or take me</font>

18
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer explaining it to hear but trust</font>

19
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,109
me that takes me five minutes not<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need</font>

20
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:32,668
to take me five minutes it means i'm not

21
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:34,020
just relying on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> project to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

22
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">three for me if one project fails and</font>

23
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,260
then your face falls apart that's not

24
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,430
going to happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I'm not just</font>

25
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,750
relying on one<font color="#E5E5E5"> product to even out my</font>

26
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,520
whole face and if it melts off then I'm

27
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,750
screwed I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of quite happy with the</font>

28
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,980
way I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing my routine in a moment and</font>

29
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,559
and yeah it's just really easy and

30
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,090
really simple and especially the fact

31
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,350
that I've like departed most of the

32
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that means it's really really</font>

33
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,230
portable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only use a brush at the</font>

34
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,670
end and I think sometimes this

35
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,079
foundation routine really suits my

36
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,610
lifestyle it might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the best one</font>

37
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,109
it might not be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pro 1 i'm</font>

38
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,719
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you my makeup</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking pro</font>

41
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,720

44
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,040
shower<font color="#E5E5E5"> while I'm in the shower I use</font>

45
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,750
scrub your nose in it by<font color="#CCCCCC"> so for glory</font>

46
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,880
can I rave about this anymore I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

47
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if you're a new subscriber I will</font>

48
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,570
link the videos in which I talk about

49
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,119
this but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> genuinely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the only face</font>

50
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,100
scrub<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use the moisturizing process</font>

51
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,720
does kind of come into my face routine

52
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,580
so I don't always<font color="#E5E5E5"> moisturize my face</font>

53
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,110
before I do this but depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the day</font>

54
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,700
but today it's quite sunny my skin's

55
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,380
feeling kind of supple anyway so I'm not

56
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,689
too worried about pre moisturizing so

57
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">this tinted moisturizer / blemish</font>

58
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,640
blemish balm what is watering twister

59
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,479
blemish blemish balm BB cream that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

60
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,180
and it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this now it tricked me</font>

61
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,530
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I'd finished it absolutely</font>

62
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,240
hadn't I could have opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with scissors</font>

63
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,009
and there was enough product feed 5,000

64
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,509
so i ended up departing it in to you

65
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,369
about three different tiny little pots

66
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,409
like this and so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pots</font>

67
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,700
that I've d plotted it into you I

68
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,110
actually really recommend next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

69
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,430
get one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these I'm gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look I don't</font>

70
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">even comment when I drop this now is</font>

71
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,790
just absolutely normal to me and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

72
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,960
get another one I'm definitely just

73
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,610
going to deport all the product straight

74
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,409
away because it is kind of hard because

75
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,660
as a squeezy tub it is so hard to get

76
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,099
the right Maya product and i just spent

77
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,980
hours trying to work in excess

78
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,450
note in my thin skin just cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

79
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to waste it and it's just silly and</font>

80
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,260
so I definitely recommend departing it

81
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,730
into little turbs like this so you can

82
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">just sweep up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of product</font>

83
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,330
leave one<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely love this product I</font>

84
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,129
think the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used it I didn't</font>

85
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,330
see any difference so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one of those</font>

86
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,069
ones you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on go away for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

87
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:29,780
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> let thinking let's do it stuff</font>

88
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,430
and at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you really can see a</font>

89
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,720
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I always notice if I'm</font>

90
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,250
not wearing it this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

91
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I wear even if I'm probably just</font>

92
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,769
gonna wear mascara I wear this and

93
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:38,269
mascara because even though I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

94
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:39,590
a lot of problem skin or blemishes and

95
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,660
stuff I do have a bit of a an even skin

96
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,459
tone and I get our very red and patches

97
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,590
and it's all quite patchy so this is

98
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that kind of like just blurs</font>

99
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that kind of brings out a more even skin</font>

100
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,879
tone and it's just perfect and I love it

101
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,230
natural light it's the only way you're

102
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,670
gonna make your face look okay seriously

103
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:54,500
I prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a big mirror as well just</font>

104
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,090
can I can see the overall picture but

105
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,959
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I'm just going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

106
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,420
den little mirror yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

107
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,310
dot it everywhere I didn't work too much

108
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,450
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> forehead because you don't usually</font>

109
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,060
see it because i have a fringe and but

110
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,440
it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep it moisturized mr.</font>

111
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,030
sometimes if my skin still doesn't feel

112
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,890
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> sup all or I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> feel like it's</font>

113
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:14,450
still a little bit patchy I just pop

114
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,319
more on around the places that it tends

115
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get punchy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm and I love the smell</font>

116
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this it makes very fresh in life yeah</font>

117
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,359
that's my kind of moisturizing prep

118
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,250
priming kind of step that is everything

119
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,980
really okay so I don't wear foundation

120
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,040
per se it's partly because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons</font>

121
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,120
I've mentioned in other videos where I

122
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,040
literally can't find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shade and brand</font>

123
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,290
and price that I like probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

124
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,609
foundations that tick at least two of

125
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,049
those categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> but haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found one</font>

126
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,340
the tix all three and until I do I

127
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">really can't be asked so the kind of</font>

128
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,849
basis of my foundation routine isn't

129
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,760
really foundation it is concealer and in

130
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,799
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> different degrees certain ideas</font>

131
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,870
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone Gunny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> role</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on auntie dark</font>

132
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,810
circles concealer thing and this has got

133
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,579
loads of products in its last mages it's

134
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,919
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very high coverage but it is it is</font>

135
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,480
it does give a noticeable difference and

136
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,950
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely invisible on the skin</font>

137
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,750
and i love how it blends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

138
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,739
supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with this BB cream</font>

139
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,169
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so and I kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> used this</font>

140
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:10,849
on the bits that it would be obvious if

141
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,680
I use heavy concealer on or it would

142
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,690
take away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dimensions of my face</font>

143
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,389
if i use my heavy concealer on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kind</font>

144
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,070
of do it on my chin here because my chin

145
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,140
can get quite difficult pop a little bit

146
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,960
along the cheekbones just cuz i get

147
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,460
discoloration there and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

148
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the nose</font>

149
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,800
that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very obvious if you put a</font>

150
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,659
heavy concealer on around your nose so

151
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,909
this step just kind of kind of helps to

152
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:37,189
even more even out my skin tone without

153
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,219
clogging up my pores and without kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

154
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,689
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of cake you look in the</font>

155
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,039
little crevices of your face where you

156
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:45,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">just don't want it to look cakey and the</font>

157
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:46,909
second to last step is that I use this

158
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,680
this is a foundation it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called</font>

159
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,569
dermablend is for people with acne

160
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:52,250
problems as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this obviously something</font>

161
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have when I use it as a</font>

162
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,280
foundation it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue like some bees</font>

163
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,659
come up behind me with the book and just

164
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:57,919
squashed me in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of it I look</font>

165
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,469
absolutely two-dimensional and then you

166
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:01,969
know sometimes I do do it for a night

167
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,250
out if I'm feeling absolutely mental it

168
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,590
ends at me trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improvise ways to</font>

169
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,330
put dimensions back into my face so I

170
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,349
don't know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody off watching my</font>

171
00:05:09,349 --> 00:05:10,939
chops or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool so the camera</font>

172
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,379
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut out they didn't realize towards</font>

173
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:13,819
in the next step<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

174
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,919
dedicated i went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back took all my come</font>

175
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,449
off and I've got back to this step

176
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:18,949
however if it does look a little bit

177
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:20,539
different that is why so where are they

178
00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:22,159
yes this takes all the dimensions out of

179
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,900
your face<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we recommend using it</font>

180
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,060
all over your face unless you're looking

181
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,259
for some absolutely ridiculous high

182
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:28,879
coverage you're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change your</font>

183
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,159
race or you do have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time to spend</font>

184
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,750
half an hour working out the logistics

185
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,490
of putting all the dimensions back into

186
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:36,979
your face however as a concealer this is

187
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:38,419
amazing I did used to buy the very

188
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,159
famous collection 2000 concealer okay

189
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,050
and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good like for the money</font>

190
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,819
it's amazing here that rivals<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac</font>

191
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,110
concealers and I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that</font>

192
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it is really really good I was</font>

193
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,500
for reusing one every every about four

194
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,180
weeks and having to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one so</font>

195
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,979
it's like 13 pounds sixty or something

196
00:05:51,979 --> 00:05:54,919
every three months so yeah we're getting

197
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,569
on for almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen pounds of quarter</font>

198
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,400
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> foundation is 15 pounds in the UK</font>

199
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,750
I've had this for about six months and

200
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,279
I'm only halfway through I do post it in

201
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,589
stuff like this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lush color set</font>

202
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:05,900
for a container<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ran</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out again it's</font>

203
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,279
a squeezy one you can't betray our much

204
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,289
comes out and you save so much money by

205
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:11,270
using only the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of product that</font>

206
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,740
you need and you will look<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot better</font>

207
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,379
to trust me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would really consider as a</font>

208
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:18,379
general as general advice d potting your

209
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,389
face product into smaller containers

210
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:21,650
that you can control<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your finger</font>

211
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,000
how much you take out such things are

212
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,379
clean because it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> financial</font>

213
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,029
sense and it also<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes face little</font>

214
00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">better it is quite high coverage you</font>

215
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:29,000
have to be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful with it and you</font>

216
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,620
literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't need very much</font>

really I just yeah my eyelids are kind

229
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,060
of a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit darker so it's kind of</font>

230
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,350
nice just even them out and it's a nice

231
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,880
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Base to put any eye shadows on</font>

just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit lighter than and just</font>

kind of makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the colors come out a</font>

234
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,430
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit truer if you don't have the</font>

235
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,350
colored primer which I do anyway so I

238
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,990
done this already that's why my forehead

can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress enough how much your</font>

242
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,920
advocate i am at the moment for using

00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,600
your fingers it's summer you really need

244
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,250
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> its blending well you need to</font>

245
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,930
warm up the product<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get it into your</font>

246
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,030
skin properly so it stays longer and

247
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,910
I've had enough with funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with</font>

248
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,010
brushes to be honest<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the time of</font>

249
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,420
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mini and I feel like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this works a</font>

250
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,460
lot better anyway so there you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

251
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,350
so that is my concealer don't now this

252
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,570
is an optional one it's only I only do

253
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,040
this if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand a long time or</font>

254
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,780

255
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,910
the elf complexion perfection powder I

256
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,920
know so controversial what we're doing

257
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,390
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crap product it's actually</font>

258
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,710
not very crap but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it doesn't</font>

259
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,720
really even<font color="#E5E5E5"> like skin tone very well but</font>

260
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,730
as the powder I think it's a I've

261
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,440
just fine powder especially for the

262
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,150
price and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packaging</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so good and</font>
