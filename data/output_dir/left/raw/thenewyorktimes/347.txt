1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,630
“This immigration debate will
have a level playing field

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,580
and an amendment
process that is fair

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,749
to all sides.”

4
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,200
That was the promise
made by Senate Majority Leader

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,700
Mitch McConnell.

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,650
It was enough for
Senate Democrats

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,830
to agree to a funding deal.

8
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,580
And the Democrats are
selling that promise

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,440
made by McConnell as a win.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,930
“We got a firm
commitment on the floor

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,400
before the entire country.”

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,080
“I was very pleased that we have
a commitment from the majority

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,580
leader.”

14
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,220
“We’ve tried for
four years to get

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,472
a vote on DACA protections
and have had no luck.

16
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:33,430
We’re going to get one now.”

17
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,580
The bill doesn’t
contain protections

18
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,849
for the so-called Dreamers,
young undocumented immigrants

19
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:43,140
who face threat of deportation.

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,570
That was a major sticking
point for the Democrats.

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:54,870
“This will be called
the Trump shutdown.”

22
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,960
But just three days
later, Senator Schumer

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,020
agreed to end the government
shutdown without a firm path

24
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,490
to a solution on DACA.

25
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,879
“In a few hours, the
government will reopen.

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,200
We have a lot to do.”

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,420
Now, it seems the
fate of the Dreamers

28
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,580
rests in the Republicans’ hands.

29
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,010
Immigrants rights activists
are urging their supporters

30
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,580
to protest what they’ve labeled
the #SchumerSellout.

31
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,010
But some Democrats insist
it’s on Senator McConnell

32
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,694
to keep his promise, not them.

33
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:22,610
“The proof will be whether
he actually does it.

34
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,640
He’s made so many promises
even to his own members

35
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,570
that he has not honored, so he
has a reputation now of being

36
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,130
somebody you can’t count on.”

37
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,140
While the blame game
continues, the stage

38
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,000
is set for a showdown.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,640
The fate of hundreds of
thousands of young immigrants

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:00:00,000
is hanging in the balance.
