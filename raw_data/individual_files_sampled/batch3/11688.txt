America's dreamers debate might actually have some residents in Scotland where the local Parliament is looking into the possibility of granting the right to vote to anyone granted asylum or residency permit it would include a right to participate in local and Scottish Parliament elections the Scottish Minister for parliamentary business claimed that it's only fair that those who have the right to live there should have the right to vote and we debate the issue with her James Dornan from the Scottish National Party and David Coburn from the UK Independence Party the idea that any country allows people who are not their citizens to vote in any election is this unheard of and totally wrong the Scottish National Party want to gerrymander the elections and no they want to give the votes every Tom Dick and Harry this is wrong anybody but the English I should think I don't know how that goes down some people might call that racist of that ramble and rant say I just hear from David Cornell the only person that sounded racist on it was him the fact we are not interested in the race of people that I've got a right to vote and if they get the right to stay here then I think it's only appropriate that they'll get right to have a seat they must have British citizenship all the Scottish National Party are trying to gerrymander it they'll have anybody in the country they'll give them a few give us some explanations be quiet for a moment I would well you should be quiet let me speak I'd let you speak essentially anybody who's English voting but anybody else can have a vote no matter where they come from this is unheard of countries normally only allow people to vote in their elections who are our citizens of that country the the ridiculous David Coburn continues to see about the only people we weren't allowed to vote on the English the English people who stay here vote consistently on all sorts of issues if the big deal for that I mean looks tobe able to vote for whoever they want to vote for that's called democracy because what you want to do is Scottish Scottish soldiers and Scottish people were not given the vote if they were not resident in Scotland attained of the referendum this is another pathetic effort by the Scottish National Party to gerrymander a future independence vote this is not a game this is a bit right mate Scotland the right sort of country that the people who live in Scotland will get the opportunity to decide what it's about
