when you attend law school you you kind of get a notion of the that's not all you want to do there's other things you want to do that kind of round out your life and when you come out you end up going to the office and you know drinking out of the same coffee cup every day and not much changes and it's a very dangerous thing especially when you're in a in a profession that requires that you have to think in terms of different ideas different cultures in the practice of law there's this discussion that we've been awful where it comes to protecting women in the practice and giving them the same opportunity that a male counterpart might have they they have a glass ceiling in Jena Romano is somebody that you know if your male lawyer trial lawyer female trial or whatever you would not want to be on the other side of the table with her because she is she is exactly the prototype of a female trial lawyer that I've worked with and against to go to the office and say well this is all I do I think actually detract from your ability to think as a creative attorney and so I started writing very early I started off with with motivational books for lawyers the first one was in search of Atticus Finch and that evolved into resurrecting ESOP maybe you didn't know that the Department of Justice is so that they're so dysfunctional or the FDA has been captured by by corporate America or the SEC is simply an extension of Wall Street maybe you don't know these things until you read them in the setting of a fiction book and then you ask yourself your question wow did that really happen is this really true there is going to be no glass ceiling and if there is on the bus ride through it
