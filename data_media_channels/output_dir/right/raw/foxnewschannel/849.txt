THIS MORNING WHERE GERMANY'S

3
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:14,061
LEADER, ANGELA MERKEL, COULD

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:15,329
LOSE POWER ANY DAY NOW BECAUSE

5
00:00:15,329 --> 00:00:17,498

HERE TO REACT, FOX NEWS NATIONAL

00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:24,038

DR. SEBASTIAN GORKA.

>> HAPPY FATHER'S DAY, PETE.

11
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:30,544
>> PETE: HAPPY FATHER'S DAY.

12
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:32,479
YOU COULD CALL HER CHANCELLOR OR

13
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,914
THE QUEEN OF OPEN BORDERS.

14
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:35,916
ARE THERE GOING TO BE

15
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,352
CONSEQUENCES FOR THE POLICIES

16
00:00:38,352 --> 00:00:38,986
SHE'S TAKING?

17
00:00:38,986 --> 00:00:41,388
>> ABSOLUTELY, HER COALITION

18
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:43,324
PARTNER IS TRYING TO REFLECT THE

19
00:00:43,324 --> 00:00:45,726
REALITY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION OF

20
00:00:45,726 --> 00:00:47,394
DISASTROUS IMMIGRATION POLICIES.

21
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:49,730
A RECENT POLL AMONGST GERMAN

22
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,166
VOTERS SAW THAT MORE THAN 60% OF

23
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,568
THOSE POLLED SAID THEY DON'T

24
00:00:54,568 --> 00:00:58,505
WANT UNDOCUMENTED ASYLUM SEEKERS

25
00:00:58,505 --> 00:00:59,940
EVEN LET INTO THE COUNTRY.

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,475
THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE

27
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:02,409
BORDERS FOR AS LONG AS YOU LIKE

28
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,812
AND THERE WON'T BE CONSEQUENCES

29
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:05,846
FOR YOU POLITICALLY OR EVEN WHEN

30
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:08,682
IT COMES TO THE SAFETY OF THE

31
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:11,418
NATION, WELL, FINALLY REALITY IS

32
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:13,921
GIVING PAUSE FOR THOUGHT TO THE

33
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:16,924
POLITICSES IN GERMANY.

34
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:18,792
>> PETE: -- POLITICIANS IN

35
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:19,293
GERMANY.

36
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:20,728
>> PETE: THE VOICES OF THE

37
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:21,395
VOTERS MATTER.

38
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:22,663
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE

39
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:24,365
CONSEQUENCES OF THE VISIONS OF

40
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:27,468
THE OPEN BORDERS ELITE ARE

41
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:29,536
SAYING WAIT, YOU CHANGED THE

42
00:01:29,536 --> 00:01:30,537
CONTOURS OF OUR COUNTRY.

43
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:32,106
WE MAY NOT BE IN FOR THIS.

44
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:33,841
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORDERS OR

45
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:37,010
IF YOU DON'T CONTROL -- GERMANY

46
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,380
HAS BASICALLY SAID WE'LL ACCEPT

47
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,281
ANYBODY, THEN THE CONCEPT OF THE

48
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:42,716
NATION CEASES TO EXIST.

49
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:44,618
NOT ONLY THAT, YOU SEE THE

50
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:45,619
ATTACKS HAPPENING AGAIN AND

51
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:47,154
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

52
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:47,921
GERMANY HAS SUFFERED.

53
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,590
THERE'S BEEN ANOTHER KNIFE

54
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,225
ATTACK JUST WITHIN MINUTES OF

55
00:01:51,225 --> 00:01:52,559
THIS BROADCAST IN FRANCE.

56
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:55,696
SO THIS IS WHY EVENTS LIKE

57
00:01:55,696 --> 00:01:56,130
BREXIT OCCUR.

58
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,998
THEY'RE THE REALITY CHECK FOR

59
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,733
THESE ELITES THAT SIMPLY DON'T

60
00:01:59,733 --> 00:02:02,035
LIVE IN THE REAL WORLD AND WHO

61
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:04,671
THINK THAT YOU CAN DO THIS

62
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:06,006
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.

63
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:07,608
MERKEL, ON HER NEW YEAR'S EVE

64
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:09,276
STATEMENT TWO YEARS AGO SAID THE

65
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:11,779
BIGGEST THREAT TO GERMANY IS

66
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:12,579
JIHADI TERRORISM.

67
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:14,314
IN THE NEXT SENTENCE SHE SAID

68
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:16,383
BUT WE WILL NOT STOP ALLOWING

69
00:02:16,383 --> 00:02:19,119
REFUGEES AND ASYLUM SEEKERS INTO

70
00:02:19,119 --> 00:02:19,787
THE COUNTRY.

71
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:22,723
THOSE TWO THINGS, THEY CAN'T

72
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:23,490
EXIST AT THE SAME TIME.

73
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,458
>> PETE: NOT IN REALITY.

74
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,194
THEY'VE WELCOMED ALMOST

75
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:28,695
1.6 MILLION REFUGEES.

76
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:29,696
ANOTHER SUBJECT WE'VE GOT TO GET

77
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:33,033
YOUR TAKE ON IS OF COURSE THE

78
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:34,268
LEFT, LOOK AT SOME OF THESE

79
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:35,769
HEADLINES AND THE WAY THEY'RE

80
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:36,804

00:02:36,804 --> 00:02:38,105
ESPECIALLY FOLLOWING HIS MEETING

82
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:38,639
WITH KIM JONG UN.

83
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,941
THE WASHINGTON POST SAYS

OF DICTATORS.

94
00:02:59,326 --> 00:03:01,328
BECAUSE HE CUTS A DEAL THAT

95
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:05,699
MAKES AMERICA SAFER, HE'S AN

96
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:06,066
AUTOCRAT.

97
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:07,401
>> DID THEY SAY THE SAME THING

98
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:13,774
WHEN KENNEDY MET WITH KRUSCHEF

99
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,809
IN THE 1960s?

100
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:18,178
THESE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM

101
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:19,913
TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.

THE SINGAPORE SUMMIT WHICH I WAS

103
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,550

CRITICIZE HIM FOR IT?

116
00:03:37,097 --> 00:03:41,702
THEY LIVE IN AN ALTERNATE
