1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,219
AN ETERNITY FOR DIPLOMACY.

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:04,653
MARTHA?

3
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:05,320
>> Martha: TRACE, THANK YOU

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:05,721
SO MUCH.

5
00:00:05,721 --> 00:00:07,289
HERE NOW GENERAL JACK KEANE,

6
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:08,657
FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC

7
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:09,591
ANALYST AND CHAIRMAN OF THE

8
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:10,926
INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF

9
00:00:10,926 --> 00:00:11,293
WAR.

10
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:12,494
GENERAL, THIS HAS ALREADY

11
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:13,762
BEEN QUITE AN INTERESTING

12
00:00:13,762 --> 00:00:14,730
ROLLER COASTER TO WATCH.

13
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,898
MIKE POMPEO, THE SECRETARY

14
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:17,833
OF STATE HAS BEEN TWICE NOW

15
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:18,400
TO NORTH KOREA.

16
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,069
SO I GUESS ON THIS ROUND

17
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:21,236
THEY SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18
00:00:21,236 --> 00:00:22,171
YOU’RE GOING TO COME TO US

19
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:22,972
IN NEW YORK.

20
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:24,340
WE’RE GOING TO TALK THERE.

21
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,041
WHILE ANOTHER DELEGATES HAS

22
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,544
GONE OVER TO DISCUSS

23
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:29,245
DENUCLEARIZATION AND EXACTLY

24
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:30,446
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.

25
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:31,614
WHERE DOES THIS ALL STAND IN

26
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:32,081
YOUR MIND?

27
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,849
>> WELL, I THINK THE VISIT

28
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:35,584
OF THE NORTH KOREAN ENVOY

29
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,986
HERE IS SOMETHING OF THAT

30
00:00:36,986 --> 00:00:38,487
STATURE WHO CLEARLY HAS BEEN

31
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:41,190
ALL THE MAJOR NEGOTIATION

32
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,891
POINTS, HE IS OBVIOUSLY

33
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:43,159
CARRYING A MESSAGE.

34
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:46,495
AND I THINK FIRST, THAT

35
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:48,664
MESSAGE IS THAT KIM JONG UN

36
00:00:48,664 --> 00:00:50,166
DEFINITELY WANTS THE SUMMIT

37
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:50,967
GO FORWARD.

38
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,335
THE PRESIDENT DEFINITELY

39
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:53,469
HASN’T MADE THAT FINAL

40
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:54,137
DECISION YET.

41
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,473
HE STUNNED THE CHINESE AND

42
00:00:57,473 --> 00:00:59,275
NORTH KOREANS AND SOUTH

43
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:00,977
KOREANS AS WELL WHEN HE

44
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,712
STAGED THE SUMMIT.

45
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:04,212
LACK OF SERIOUSNESS ON THE

46
00:01:04,212 --> 00:01:05,782
PART OF THE NORTH KOREANS

47
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,050
UNDULY INFLUENCED BY THE

48
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,383
CHINESE.

49
00:01:07,383 --> 00:01:08,217
IS HE CARRYING THAT MESSAGE

50
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:10,053
WE WANT THIS SUMMIT TO GO

51
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:10,386
FORWARD.

52
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:12,255
AND I THINK LIKELY HE IS

53
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:15,124
TRYING TO GET THE ACTUAL

54
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:17,160
CONTENT OF THE SUMMIT BACK

55
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,462
ON TRACK THAT KIM JONG UN IS

56
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:20,664
SERIOUS ABOUT

57
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,798
DENUCLEARIZATION WHETHER HE

58
00:01:21,798 --> 00:01:23,066
TRULY IS OR NOT, REMAINS TO

59
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:23,967
BE SEEN.

60
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:26,703
WHAT THESE GUYS SAY AND WHAT

61
00:01:26,703 --> 00:01:28,371
THEY DO LARGELY ARE TWO

62
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:29,072
DIFFERENT THINGS.

63
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:30,473
I THINK IS HE LARGELY TRYING

64
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:31,675
TO CONVEY A MESSAGE THAT KIM

65
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,543
JONG UN IS ABSOLUTELY COMMIT

66
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:34,878
YOU HAD FROM THE UNITED

67
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:36,179
STATES MAJOR CONCESSION TO

68
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,115
HIM IS THAT THE SECURITY OF

69
00:01:38,115 --> 00:01:39,716
HIS REGIME INDEFINITELY.

70
00:01:39,716 --> 00:01:41,485
BUT I DO THINK THE KEY

71
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:42,653
MEETING IS ALSO GOING TO

72
00:01:42,653 --> 00:01:47,457
TAKE PLACE AND IS TAKING

73
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:49,927
PLACE YESTERDAY WITH OUR

74
00:01:49,927 --> 00:02:03,107
DELEGATES AND DELEGATION.

75
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:04,508
>> THAT’S WHAT IT ALL COMES

76
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:06,410
DOWN, TO WHAT DOES

77
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:06,977
DENUCLEARIZATION MEAN?

78
00:02:06,977 --> 00:02:08,445
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

79
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:09,213
IS IT SOMETHING THAT HAPPENS

80
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,580
IN A COUPLE OF STAGES

81
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,682
BECAUSE IN THE PAST WE HAVE

82
00:02:11,682 --> 00:02:12,650
BEEN PROMISED THAT AND

83
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,284
GOTTEN NOTHING.

84
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:14,285
WE HAVE SEEN THOSE

85
00:02:14,285 --> 00:02:16,620
FACILITIES REOPENED,

86
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,888
REOPERATING IN NO TIME AFTER

87
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,056
THEY GOT THEIR MONEY

88
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:19,457
ESSENTIALLY.

89
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,491
WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO LOOK

90
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,259
LIKE IN YOUR MIND?

91
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:22,493
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT THE

92
00:02:22,493 --> 00:02:25,863
LEADER OF OUR DELEGATES, KIM

93
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:27,265
IS PROBABLY ASKING THE NORTH

94
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:28,299
KOREANS AND WANTING FROM

95
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:29,800
THEM, IF YOU ARE SERIOUS

96
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,868
ABOUT DENUCLEARIZATION, GIVE

97
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:33,237
US A FULL ACCOUNTING OF YOUR

98
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,072
NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND YOUR

99
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,274
MISSILES, WHERE THEY ARE

100
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:36,607
LOCATED.

101
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:37,975
WHERE THE STORAGE SITES ARE.

102
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,977
WHERE THE FUEL SITES ARE ET

103
00:02:39,977 --> 00:02:40,311
CETERA.

104
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:42,780
LET’S PUT TOGETHER A PROCESS

105
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,983
TO VERIFY AND OUR ABILITY TO

106
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:47,518
OVERSEE YOUR DISARMING AND

107
00:02:47,518 --> 00:02:48,586
DISMANTLING THAT ON SOME

108
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,420
KIND OF A SCHEDULE THAT

109
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,121
MAKES SENSE.

110
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:50,922
NOT SOMETHING THAT’S GOING

111
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,390
TO TAKE MANY YEARS BUT

112
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,625
SOMETHING THAT’S REASONABLE

113
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,193
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

114
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:59,731
I’M CONFIDENT DELEGATION

115
00:02:59,731 --> 00:03:00,732
WOULD WANT TO SEE THAT FROM

116
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:01,466
THE NORTH KOREANS.

117
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:02,701
WHETHER THEY WOULD WANT TO

118
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,935
PUT THAT ON THE TABLE OR NOT

119
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,036
IS ANOTHER MANNER.

120
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:06,838
LIKELY THERE IS GOING TO BE

121
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:07,606
DIFFERENCES, MARTHA.

122
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,774
THE SUMMIT HINGES ON WHETHER

123
00:03:09,774 --> 00:03:14,613
OUR DELEGATION IN THEIR

124
00:03:14,613 --> 00:03:16,448
MINDS CAN RESOLVE SOME OF

125
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:17,249
THOSE DIFFERENCES THROUGH

126
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:18,583
NEGOTIATION WHERE THE SUMMIT

127
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,485
CAN AT LEAST HAVE THE

128
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:21,420
STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK AND

129
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,688
BEGIN A PROCESS TO BE

130
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:23,088
SUCCESSFUL.

131
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:24,756
IF THEY THINK IT’S NOT

132
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:26,525
RESOLVABLE, THEN I THINK THE

133
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:27,993
SUMMIT WOULD BE DELAYED

134
00:03:27,993 --> 00:03:29,661
UNTIL WE’RE ABLE TO CHANGE

135
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:32,197
THOSE CONDITIONS A LITTLE

136
00:03:32,197 --> 00:03:32,931
BIT.

137
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:33,532
>> Martha: FASCINATING.

138
00:03:33,532 --> 00:03:34,133
YOU KNOW, CLEARLY THEY

139
00:03:34,133 --> 00:03:34,900
ALREADY KNOW THAT PRESIDENT

140
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,735
TRUMP DOESN’T APPROVE OF THE

141
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:37,736
IRAN MODEL.

142
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:38,837
SO THAT’S PROBABLY NOT GOING

143
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:39,371
TO HAPPEN.

144
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,406
AND IT’S PROBABLY THE MODEL

145
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,508
THAT THEY WOULD MOST LIKE SO

146
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:44,009
WE’LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES.

147
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:45,044
GENERAL, THANK YOU VERY

148
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:45,344
MUCH.

149
00:03:45,344 --> 00:03:46,412
GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US

150
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:46,745
TONIGHT.

151
00:03:46,745 --> 00:03:48,981
>> MARTHA, ONE MORE THING.

152
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:50,249
THEY KNOW FULL WELL THAT

153
00:03:50,249 --> 00:03:51,250
THEY CAN’T PLAY DONALD

154
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:51,817
TRUMP.

155
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,018
CHINA, NORTH KOREA, AND EVEN

156
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,019
SOUTH KOREA HAVE ALL TRIED

157
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:55,454
THAT IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS.

158
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:56,655
AND THEY KNOW THEY ARE NOT

159
00:03:56,655 --> 00:03:58,824
GOING TO GET AWAY WITH IT.

160
00:03:58,824 --> 00:03:59,558
>> Martha: NANCY PELOSI SAID

161
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:00,960
HE MUST BE HAVING A GIGGLE

162
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,728
FIT OVER THIS LETTER KIM

163
00:04:02,728 --> 00:00:00,000
JONG UN, SHE IS NOTICEABLY
