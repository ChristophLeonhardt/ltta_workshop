1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,689
so I do psychology at<font color="#E5E5E5"> University and a</font>

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:05,759
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have tutorials where</font>

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:07,980
you sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a group we have about 12</font>

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,000
people at the beginning year we've

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,230
already got for now because people have

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,880
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course and you have a cheater</font>

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,070
and you discuss concerns and you go

8
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,809
through different objectives which are

9
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:18,060
more generally based not necessary about

10
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,029
the subject maps in which you plan your

11
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:23,400
goals at<font color="#E5E5E5"> University and what you want to</font>

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">do after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do all presentations getting</font>

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,390
your skills etc but as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,320
Archie I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he is able to</font>

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,969
he sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> diversity talks about</font>

16
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">general</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know psychology on a more</font>

17
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,450
interesting basis will interest him and

18
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,370
other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are unsure if it works I</font>

19
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,649
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works and something he's</font>

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,260
brought recently is the aspect of free

21
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,760
will because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something he's looked</font>

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,690
into in the past and when he told me I

23
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,489
found it very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting and I thought</font>

24
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:58,649
I'd show over you today with my own

25
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:00,510
perspective on it as well and then maybe

26
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,439
you could share your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own thoughts now</font>

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,020
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not religious in the classical sense</font>

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,900
in which I can full done all that

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,080
screams around in terms of you know

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,390
conforming to a particular religion but

31
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,420
you know I am religious I have beliefs

32
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,729
just don't conform<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a typical one and</font>

33
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:26,400
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe there is a spiritual</font>

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,579
side within all of us but however

35
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:32,400
science could isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to but could</font>

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,950
prove that spirituality doesn't exist

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's just maybe an emotion so bear</font>

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,689
with me and I'll explain this because I

39
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,130
try and explain it in quite a tangible

40
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,850
sense if you can imagine that our brains

41
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,240
don't have a spirit we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,049
spirit we have just<font color="#CCCCCC"> our brain which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,799
biological muscle doing many functions

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,030
and we have consciousness which is how

45
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,369
we feel we're conscious and we have the

46
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:04,469
subconsciousness you know controlling

47
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,550
the heart rate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also just you know</font>

48
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,929
discriminations the reasons why we make

49
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,959
that conscious decision to do things

50
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,090
so we've got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

51
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,890
walking around and subconsciously your

52
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,269
body's<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing all these reactions so</font>

53
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:24,069
you're in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> let what we've got to take</font>

54
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">a starting point so let's take me in</font>

55
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,300
this room I have the amok<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feeling</font>

56
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,849
that I want to be creative and

57
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,890
consciously I am now making a vlog and

58
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,799
talking to people now if I do it on an

59
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:37,690
everyday basis if I'm having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

60
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,519
conversation with<font color="#CCCCCC"> someone and I'm a and</font>

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,910
someone else's<font color="#E5E5E5"> person B person a would</font>

62
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,410
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something because they'd feel the</font>

63
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,269
need to subconsciously and it would

64
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:49,150
overwrite onto a conscious level person

65
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,569
B would<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and they calculate it</font>

66
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,610
they'd hear it understand it all the

67
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,410
processes and at a subconscious level

68
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,959
they feel a certain way about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

69
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,780
chemical processes it maybe it was a

70
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,569
threatening thing you know they feel

71
00:03:04,569 --> 00:03:06,069
threatened that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how</font>

72
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,470
conversation works and as a result the

73
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,640
chemical reactions have a knock-on

74
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,739
effect which makes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel in a certain</font>

75
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:14,200
way consciously which would make you

76
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,560
respond in a particular way person B

77
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,660
would respond maybe say<font color="#E5E5E5"> psych maybe Rex</font>

78
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:22,780
and certain way an intern person a would

79
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,840
then react to that subconsciously and

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,480
bring it into a conscious level so what

81
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,310
am I getting at with this what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

82
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to do with the spirit well</font>

83
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,359
you've got to think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this way what</font>

84
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,500
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were only a knock-on effect that</font>

85
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,959
maybe definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> does exist but in the</font>

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,430
sense that the future isn't

87
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,859
predetermined but it is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

88
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:48,190
in a certain way it depends how<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say</font>

89
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">predetermine it it's not written but</font>

90
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,139
there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one way of it going about</font>

91
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:56,290
and it is where it's a knock-on effect

92
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,669
one person feels one way and then

93
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else reacts to it environment</font>

94
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,540
our environment makes us feel in a

95
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,579
certain way and then we react in a

96
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:05,980
certain way and what we believe is free

97
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,959
will what we believe we are making the

98
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,030
conscious decision to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

99
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,440
me saying I'm going to pick up this

100
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,810
glass of water now that is because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

101
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,549
chemical reactions that my subconscious

102
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,789
level have coincidentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> lets me making</font>

103
00:04:18,789 --> 00:04:21,159
a conscious decision to use this as an

104
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,110
example maybe it saw it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> corner of</font>

105
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,210
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye</font>

106
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,040
quite worrying isn't it we are nothing

107
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than just energy bouncing around in</font>

108
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,830
this world in a biological organism and

109
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:37,720
at a conscious level I feel like I'm in

110
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,970
control when in fact the only reason I'm

111
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,710
making the decisions I make the only

112
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,390
reasons you make the decisions you make

113
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,600
is because you feel a certain way and

114
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,490
your body's taken things in and causes

115
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,130
action with it but does that mean that

116
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,710
if we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just that if we are out of</font>

117
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">control should we the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> value life because</font>

118
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,450
some people feel depressed about it I

119
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,580
fall is quite depressing thing but if

120
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">this happens to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> proven maybe in the</font>

121
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,580
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is true there is</font>

122
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,710
no spirit we are just bouncing<font color="#E5E5E5"> off one</font>

123
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,660
another with genetic blueprints nature

124
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">nurtures both exist you're born with you</font>

125
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">know genetic blueprints which can be</font>

126
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,600
triggered by different environmental

127
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,170
effects does that mean that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

128
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,940
devalue here we aren't know you and I

129
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,080
think we should still enjoy your life

130
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,910
because even if this was to be the case

131
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:33,340
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy the experience you're in</font>

132
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,230
now if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a buzz from life and</font>

133
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,020
if you can feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're in control</font>

134
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">then surely that's what should be</font>

135
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,100
important to you so if you're in a

136
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,880
particular religion a particular belief

137
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,350
you know express your forces what do you

138
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,170
think what if there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be proof that</font>

139
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,330
this happened to be the case that this

140
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,220
is who we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are now that goes into a whole</font>

141
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">different debate of what is proof</font>

142
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,460
because something I've done in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

143
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">my lab reports on psychology is when</font>

144
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">results prove or show the results of a</font>

145
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,810
particular theory to me I always<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

146
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,880
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> prove it it just shows it's</font>

147
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,950
the same as that doesn't prove there's a

148
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,140
connection even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though no matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

149
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,900
many times you do it and it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

150
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,690
theory about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Swan you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know swans are</font>

151
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,970
white but there's the odd<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey one you</font>

152
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,860
know but you never<font color="#E5E5E5"> verily see it so are</font>

153
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,150
we to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all swans are white</font>

154
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,900
knight but you could say the<font color="#E5E5E5"> grey one is</font>

155
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,030
an anomaly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's not what out</font>

156
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll know it exists and therefore</font>

157
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's infinite combinations of what</font>

158
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,680
could actually be out there

159
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,169
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll ever away from that but</font>

160
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,830
consciousness we we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have free will</font>

161
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,050
and the thing that builds on upon this

162
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,180
is how can you explain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision</font>

163
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">making if this very was to be true</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it be</font>

164
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,310
the fact that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the choice</font>

165
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,400
to choose what we're going to do but we

166
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,270
have the choice to choose not what to do

167
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,740
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> give an example you're sitting</font>

168
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a lecture for instance you're bored</font>

169
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you're thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd love to do this</font>

170
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,380
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now but you choose not to do it so</font>

171
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you stay there it's process of</font>

172
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,650
elimination because in life with full of

173
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,509
choices and how do we come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

174
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,970
choice in which we choose to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it's</font>

175
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">not necessary choosing it but enough is</font>

176
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,660
eliminating what we wish not to do use

177
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">your free will or perhaps use your</font>

178
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,880
subconscious to conscious level thinking

179
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,130
to give a reaction<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this video</font>

180
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,169
whatever interpretation you have just

181
00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:32,840
posted video response now and let's

182
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,340
discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> this because I think it's</font>

183
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,610
absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> fascinating psychology first</font>

184
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,090
philosophy doesn't always combine a mix

185
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,010
in the right ways but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

186
00:07:43,010 --> 00:00:00,000
learn from both what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font>
