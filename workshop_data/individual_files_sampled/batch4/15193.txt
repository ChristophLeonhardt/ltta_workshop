oh yeah it's about that Star Wars easily the most popular iconic and intriguing franchise ever made I mean it literally start its own religion I'm not kidding so Disney's the last Jedi comes to theaters December 15 but before that happens let's take a look back on Star Wars The Force awakens why I left some people disappointed how it fell into the new cultures trap of instant gratification how that can hurt a story as well as any political and religious themes involved okay let's do this you will thumbs up this video and subscribe to the rebel media forces strong with me okay there's one reason why we have to talk about this and it is because the movie is more than just a movie it is so popular it's in our culture and the money it makes this courageous okay supposedly Star Wars The Force awakens was made for about two hundred thirty million dollars which is absolutely insane but it grossed over two billion billion with the beed dollars worldwide and box office resident revenue not including rentals DVD sales merchandise that is a lot of place I mean it is literally it's like it's like if country's GDP it's crazy and JJ Abrams was the perfect director to bring onboard to revitalize this incredible franchise he did terrific work on Mission Impossible 3 as well as the new Star Trek's specifically the second star trek into darkness which is one of my favorite sci-fi movies the past ten years so since this movies already been out for a year let me warn you a lot of spoilers ahead alright let's get into it as a movie I'm gonna give Star Wars The Force awakens a four out of five really this is just a great popcorn flick you get to go to the movie be launched in this incredible world of Star Wars with aliens and humans and abilities and powers and this power struggle and the conflict and politics it's all there it's a lot of fun in a fast-paced fun colorful bright exploding movie and JJ Abrams did a great job of balancing this incredible spectacle with the intimate characters and what they're struggling with in it and one of the most difficult things he had to balance was the nostalgia of the old films to bring it back to the new this movie is almost beat for beat plot point for plot point this the first Star Wars which was actually the fourth in the series Star Wars a new hope back in 1977 they also bring back old characters like Han Solo played by Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher who plays Princess Leia it was great to see them on screen and they try to balance these characters out it was really cool to watch for all people you get a little bit of reward from everyone like they just did a good job of making everyone a little bit happy though I don't think they fully fleshed out any of those they just tried to hit the biggest market possible and they did now my critic review gonna give us three out of five because I have a lot of personal problems with this and why I'm kind of afraid for stuff coming out in the future and to do this let's go back to the very first Star Wars why it was so much more magical and achieved more than any other sci-fi movie before it it's because the world was so well thought out in ground once you establish rules and any fantasy you just can't break those rules and the force is an excellent example of this it's not just like a superhero gets magical powers he can just defeat everyone because he's got these abilities it is something that is almost instinctive that you have to train for years and years and years and years and years and years to get up to through the princess ship with the Jedi it's not just like okay I'm gonna be a Jedi and I'm in these magical powers where now I can't believe this character you get to see them struggle and learn and earn these abilities throughout an entire movie that you're on board with him for and if you recall from the first movie Luke barely has a concept of this the only thing he does where he really has the force on this side is he just has to take one lucky shot through a hole which you know even if someone did it a 100 times someone's gonna hit it but he was able to use the Force and was guided through it all this kind of stuff there was a few other abilities too that were going up against it but was so great was Darth Vader had been a student for years and he's this terrifying figure that no one could be even obi-wan Kenobi falls to Darth Vader and it's just like he's just this opposing thing which makes you really root for Luke cause you're terrified the whole time you want this guy to succeed as he's learning his abilities in this movie so many things just happen it's like a microwave version of it it's like they wanted to follow our culture of being like okay we can't people today are gonna be upset if we don't just get our hero to where they need to be right now you know and that was what's so great and earned about the other movies is because they still had to act as real people in that world we created no person is just gonna achieve that instantly and in this movie there was just so much instant stuff happening that nothing is there and you never really care enough for the characters and you don't believe the story as much look one of the hardest things to do for a movie when you're writing is to get the people viewing it to believe this fantasy you have to believe the world by obeying the rules you've set up and to do this you have the characters that live it out through it so when a character does something that is unbelievable even in that environment like ah ha I just don't I don't believe the character I don't like the character as much and then I'm not as invest in this world because well how would they be able to do that you know what I mean like so it's just the same thing that I feel like has happened in this movie there's a term called MarySue in film and Mary Sue is basically a character that is perfect at everything like they can do things they shouldn't be able to do and they're just like automatically are the best of everything and so you don't care about them they're called a Mary Sue there's a lot of Mary Sue's in this movie specifically let's look at Finn's character you know a guy that's born in the wrong place at the wrong time in the wrong organization and we should like root for this guy just to get out of there really cool character who switches sides and can play an important role however they thrust this character into the spotlight as a true hero carrying the story when it's so unearned Finn in the movie is really just a selfish coward who lies and risks other people to get what he wants to get this fulfillment and get free who will then even still lie at the end of the movie when the whole world and universe is hood riding in the balance because he wants to save one girl that he'd met even then two scenes before it was a coward who left her to go fend for herself because he wanted to just escape and go to the side the galaxy not only doesn't change but Ellison he cares a lot and doesn't act the same and zero sense he also breaks the rules of the character if you remember anything about this series is that the Jedi are the only ones that wield these lightsabers takes years and years and years of practice to do so literally Finn just picks up a lightsaber when Han Solo is there has been around jeaious entire life just thin picks it up and starts fighting off stormtroopers even though he was the worst guy was literally a plumber on this Death Star and then he even fights the greatest antagonist in the movie at the time who is this overlord an over powerful force wielding guy and all sudden Finn is in there swinging a light saber when he doesn't use the Force he's not a Jedi he's just there fighting him just why like you just it was so unearned and ridiculous like John boyega did a terrific job just playing the character but his character didn't fit in what they were trying to get him to do now ray I love Rey and Daisy really did a phenomenal job I can't wait to see what they do with Daisy in the future however her character did get not for being in Mary Sue because she was pretty much just good at everything however she gets you know a little bit of leeway in this because she does have the force and you love her character throughout it they just sped it up I feel like way more than they should have like I said Luke struggles for three movies to try to become a Jedi Rey in this movie in just a few scenes all of a sudden can master the force and his fighting toe-to-toe with a Sith Lord like in the woods when you saw Luke fail and fail and fail for so long you're terrified of him actually fight it gave you stakes it made you care about Luke and this one you know she's probably gonna be alright because just like it's taking down this dude that would normally have taken three movies to do so another thing did was they kind of ruin the old characters that we spend literally decades learning about all their complex relationships although although the moments earned with them they kind of fizzle those away so you can insert these new characters and make you care about them specifically after spoiler alert han Solo is killed laya is devastated chewy has lived his entire life with Han Solo they're like best friends the entire movie would take a bullet for each other at the drop of a hat Chewie when they get down there Leia is staying there by herself instead of Chewie and Leia having a moment like oh my gosh this guy that we've loved our entire life is gone you just have daisy ridley who they met eight hours before going up and hugging her like somehow she knows what she's going through I mean there was just a lot of moments of this we were trying to force these new characters in there in moments that were not earned so it just it leaves the audience not believing in and you miss moments that would have really been impactful the riders in the producer they were doing this to try to make you care about what was going on instead of letting you care there's a huge difference in just forcing people together and having genuine chemistry and complex relationships form between other people now for my faith and values and also gonna slide him some politics in this I'm gonna give it a 2 out of 5 now there's a very strong theme of being selfless and laying down your life for others however there is also a theme of moral dualism in the movie it's confusing because the movie is so much just a good versus evil take down the bad guy even in the force they speak at nauseam about the balance it needs to be a balance before it's the good and evil the dark and the light now this would infer that there's at least an equality of perspective on both sides like you can see yourself being the good guy that we're on the right side of things for both sides this has to be a stay actual balance if there's no right and wrong it's just like a moral dualism work we're just on different sides of the spectrum here trying to do the right thing which is confusing because in the movie there's also a redemptive element people that fall into darkness can be redeemed back into the lights there has to be in this case a clear wrong and right and that really isn't a balance that's saying there is a right and wrong instead of just this moral subjectiveness which our culture is kind of falling into where by just believe this is right than it's right and you can there's no real right and wrong but in the movies there is a clear right and wrong however in their religion and what they believe almost there has to be a balance and these are both somehow morally justifiable if you're on different sides it just kinda doesn't make sense now from a biblical perspective the very first thing God gives us is free willing doesn't want to see from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because once you are aware of it once you have the knowledge of it then you're also responsible from knowing good from evil from right from wrong because there is a right and wrong and in James 4:17 the Bible says whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it for him at his sin now there's some really interesting political elements of this in the movie because a lot of people would think they're on the right side of the good knee in this movie however that it's not the case now there's some nice theme of this movie of conservatives fighting against a totalitarian regime the first order in this movie are the antagonist the villainous group in the entire movie and they want to control everyone and because of many buzzwords in the media people might think this might be a far-right regime but that couldn't be farther from the truth of the situation going on on screen let's just look at the heroes of this movie all the protagonists in the movie are people that are rebels there's want to live their own life the only rule is just don't kill each other do what you want to do but everyone gets what they earn throughout living their own lives it's like we're just gonna do our own thing kind of thing we're gonna fight against this people telling us what to do these characters aren't provided food they're not given free health care they're not just like slaves to the government that you want to live their own nice little acts now the first order in the movie Ares is so modeled after the Nazi Party it's crazy like the speaking scenes they even do like a Heil and it kind of thing it's a fist like it is like exactly like the Nazi Party and they act like the Nazi Party which was the nationalist Socialist Workers Party not the libertarian right party now in the first order you were assigned a job that you must do you can't work up there's not like any stormtrooper unions to get you better wages no one is really paid they're all just given food they're taken care of with health benefits and equipment you serve the regime you work for the state basically and you get what you get and this is what you're gonna have but hey you get some free stuff you're taken care of and we're all equal in this new party right right yeah so all these hippie left this in the street complaining about stuff really what they are is the first order in disguise because this is what your government is gonna look like you're not the jedis you just want everyone to live their own life and be free to do what they want no they want control of everything basically just bigger government less rights less freedom yeah so you guys have not seen Star Wars The Force awakens please go check it out it's a really fun ride super enjoyable and I cannot wait to see what Disney does with Star Wars the last Jedi hopefully they
