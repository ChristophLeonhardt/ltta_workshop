since the inauguration I have had a number of opportunities to point out what I saw is a gigantic inconsistency between Donald Trump's constant statements that climate change is a gigantic Chinese hoax and the fact that at least the Pentagon for a decade now has been saying that this is a big threat to national security and they've been taking it very seriously well that is done it is not inconsistent anymore because the Pentagon has totally erased all mention of climate change from their strategy documents one was just put out a summary document released Friday morning makes no mention of climate warming planet that didn't even get there by accident in a different context Earth isn't there sea levels or temperature so no mention of any of those things and this is sort of evolved to something I reported on a month ago that was when the White House dropped climate change from the list of threats in its national security strategy it was said at that time by a deputy defense secretary that that document really reflects the high priorities of the department which is what I'm worried about and yeah I mean we've had an acknowledgement even from people like George W Bush who certainly did not take climate change seriously back during his time they added a reference to climate change to the defense national defense strategy report saying changes with existing and future resource environmental and climate pressures may generate new security challenges these risks will require managing the divergent needs of massively increasing energy demand to maintain economic development and the need to tackle climate change so we have devolved from george w when it comes to climate change that is a scary place for sabaean yeah and well noted liberal George W Bush who was the first to included in in the national defense strategy you know why cuz his generals came to him and said we need to include this this is really important so there's a number of issues as to why they wanted to include it one is well the floods and the droughts create different migration patterns which creates instability which not only creates war from time to time arguably the Syrian war had was affected by that but also might create terrorism so now Trump has said I don't care if it creates terrorism I don't care if the generals say it it creates there's my don't care that Bush's generals and all the other generals and everybody else had said all along for all these years that we should be worried about that I don't care I don't the fossil fuel companies are my donors so I don't care if it affects the Pentagon and it threatens our troops by the way the Navy says we're on the sea the sea levels are rising it's a little bit relevant to us right nope don't it you're not even allowed to use the word temperature okay well how about Afghanistan has high temperatures of course any Arab digit can ascend is on the planet no planet no planet okay so they don't care about national security they don't care about anything but but they're goddamned owners this is the fossil fuel industry taking our country Hawks not only as Rex Tillerson you know former head of ExxonMobil running the State Department we have the Pentagon which is the biggest polluter on the planet but take it one step further I mean there's a reason why only 42 percent of Americans believe in climate change in the first place it's because the corporate media doesn't do its goddamn job I mean forget Trump for a second look at the last hurricane spell that we had five percent of news networks this is according to Guardian Media Matters said climate change fine per second that is unbelievable I mean which one it was it's unbeliev is probably oh and then in 2016 the coverage before that so over the last year it already dropped 70% from 2015 and in terms of covering climate change and just look at this year record-breaking fires hurricanes I mean it cataclysmic fronts on multiple levels here and we have a climate denying administration from the top down it's sick but we need to change the media first cuz there's a reason why we keep electing these people it's it's hard to understand how we not only have you know the most expensive military that so far as I know any species in the universe has ever had but we threw even more money at it this year more money than they had initially requested we were just like no we're gonna give you more money and even with all of that extra funding you can't do some preparation for climate change like what are you spending the money on I mean I have a good idea some of it in Yemen for instance but I don't understand with all that money how they can't just accidentally do something positive when it comes to climate change and like we are setting our selves up like the shields are down in the Trump administration the true threats there will be nothing to protect you now a bunch of I was gonna be s threats I'll say we're gonna do tons if you want a big wall that won't accomplish anything we'll spend billions on that Shore but anything that actually threatens you or your family we will do nothing about and this is not this isn't just a problem for 70 years from now this is a problem today the instability that climate change is in a cause in huge portions of the world I I study this constantly and I can't even express it to you enough and not just in you know places where there's going to be intra war and civil wars as a result of the inability to grow crops and the loss of water for farming and things like that it's going to affect us as well we're gonna have a harder time in the u.s. actually producing food and that means that a lot of countries are going to be looking elsewhere either to get the resources they need or to distract their populations from their inability to take care of stuff domestically and that is something that is already here it's only going to be worse every year from now on and the world is shrinking I mean it's going to cause innumerable refugees and mass to come here do these people not you know they hate refugees so much you would think they would at least try to care about protecting their homelands yeah and the wars and try to save their climate and look when all the hurricanes came and they were more severe we on The Young Turks explained how climate change leads to those more severe storms to dress that led to the fires same thing lifting the precipitation off the ground and the ocean creates both of those phenomenon but the rest the media won't say it because the Republicans will yell at them plus their advertisers will yell at them and that's far more important so that's not gonna get talked about and that's what no wonder that people don't realize the danger that we're in but the Pentagon actually does realize the danger were in the Naval Station Norfolk is the largest naval base in the world and he keeps flooding and not when it rains it floods when it's perfectly sunny outside because why the sea levels are rising so now they have been told and this is in a book right the the water will come talk to people who are at it or in that in that station and are part of the officials at that base they say okay you are allowed to you know obviously take care of the flooding you're allowed to talk the issue but you're now not allowed to talk about the sea level rising but yeah but that's why it's flooding no don't talk about it okay uh the largest naval base in the world cannot talk about why they keep flooding yeah insanity maybe the docks are getting lower everything's compartmentalize and that's how the funding continues you have to compartmentalize yourself just like in Houston we went in the aftermath of hurricane Harvey and you can't study cancer clusters correctly because they're all owned by big AG and big oil I mean they own the hospitals they own the schools everything structured so you cannot actually confront the powers that be and they don't even get fined during start-up and shutdown when these mass pollution spells happen during these hurricanes so these plants are just totally I mean iced yeah let alone exactly my god when the when the nuclear power plants get flooded and we're not ready because we told the Pentagon to stand down we told everybody to stand down we told them that threat that you clearly see and we're talking about just yesterday now you have to pretend it doesn't exist when that hits it's gonna be bad news and it's not gonna be an accident it's not gonna be golly gee I guess there was nothing we could do about that it's gonna be because of decisions like this that were made today if you want to get the whole young turks show every single day become a member TYT Network
