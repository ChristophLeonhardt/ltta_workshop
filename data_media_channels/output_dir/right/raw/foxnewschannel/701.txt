PUERTO RICANS NOW OUTNUMBER

PUERTO RICAN COMMUNITY.

18
00:00:47,908 --> 00:00:48,608
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

19
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:49,876
THEY SERVE IN OUR MILITARY MORE

20
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:51,410
THAN ANY OTHER GROUP.

21
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,212
THEY CARE ABOUT EDUCATION AND

22
00:00:53,213 --> 00:00:55,214
WORK AS HARD AS ANYBODY.

23
00:00:55,215 --> 00:00:56,282
THEY ARE NATURAL REPUBLICANS, WE

ANYONE WHO CAME TO FLORIDA,

00:01:15,803 --> 00:01:17,570
ESPECIALLY IN OSCEOLA COUNTY,

34
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:18,304
FLORIDA KNOWS WE ROLLED OUT THE

WE WELCOME THEM INTO OUR

39
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:29,449
GAVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO GET

40
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:30,817
THEIR LIVES BACK TO NORMAL.

41
00:01:30,818 --> 00:01:32,519
FLORIDA IS A GREAT NEIGHBOR TO

42
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,520
OUR NEIGHBORS IN PUERTO RICO AND

43
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,689
WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE.

44
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:36,423
THEY CARE ABOUT SMALL

45
00:01:36,424 --> 00:01:37,257
BUSINESSES.

46
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:38,859
THEY CARE ABOUT FAITH.

47
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,660
THEY CARE ABOUT FAMILY AND

48
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:50,304
WILL SUPPORT REPUBLICANS IN 18

49
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:52,806
AND 2,020.

50
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:53,373
>> Bret: CONGRESSMAN,

51
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:59,413
ON WHETHER OR NOT TO LEGALIZE

52
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,220
NOW THERE’S A PUSH TO LEGALIZE

53
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:09,256
RECREATIONAL USE HERE AS WELL.

54
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:12,426
A FEDERALIST.

55
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:13,961
I BELIEVE STATES KNOW WHAT’S

56
00:02:13,962 --> 00:02:15,229
BEST FOR THEIR STATES AND I

57
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,230
DON’T WANT THE FEDERAL

58
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,231
GOVERNMENT DICTATING EVERY

59
00:02:17,232 --> 00:02:17,565
POLICY.

60
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:19,600
I’M NOT IN FAVOR OF FLORIDA OF

61
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:20,601
DOING RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA

62
00:02:20,602 --> 00:02:21,202
BECAUSE I REMEMBER IN

63
00:02:21,203 --> 00:02:22,336
HIGH SCHOOL THAT WAS THE NUMBER

64
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:23,270
ONE REASON WHY SOME OF THE

65
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:25,439
PEOPLE I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH

66
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,111
WELL IN SPORTS.

67
00:02:31,613 --> 00:02:34,816
BUT I AM SUPPORTIVE, THE FACT

68
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:37,118
THAT VOTERS MADE A DECISION

69
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,152
ABOUT MEDICAL MARIJUANA.

70
00:02:38,153 --> 00:02:40,388
I WANTED IMPLEMENTED BUT I DON’T

71
00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:42,423
WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

72
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,691
COMING IN AND PROSECUTING PEOPLE

73
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:44,392
THAT ARE ACTING CONSISTENTLY

74
00:02:44,393 --> 00:02:48,630
WITH STATE LAW.

75
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:50,798
>> Commissioner Putnam: 70% OF

76
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,100
FLORIDIANS SUPPORTED MEDICAL

77
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:58,206
BUT AS A DAD AND AN EMPLOYER, I

78
00:02:58,207 --> 00:02:58,973
DON’T WANT FLORIDA TO JEOPARDIZE

79
00:02:58,974 --> 00:03:00,809
OUR FAMILY-FRIENDLY IMAGE AND BE

80
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:04,579
MARIJUANA.

81
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:08,884
IT’S NOT WHO WE WANT TO BE.

82
00:03:08,885 --> 00:03:10,619
HERE WE ARE AND THE MOST

83
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,454
FAMILY-FRIENDLY DESTINATION ON

84
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:14,122
EARTH, THAT’S NOT WHO WE WANT TO

85
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:14,790
BE.

86
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,691
WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT.

87
00:03:16,692 --> 00:03:18,660
ENFORCED MEDICAL, BUT DON’T GO

88
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,299
