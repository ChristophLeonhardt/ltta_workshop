by joining us now from Washington DC with a look at axia Sam co-founder and CEO of Axius Jim VandeHei Jim good morning to you what is ax is one big thing for this morning we got a bunch of big things but us Jonathan Swan had an amazing scoop over the weekend looking at how the the staffer that had criticized John McCain that we talked about in the past - it sort of poked fun of the fact that he was dying in a meeting and it got leaked out it turns out the President himself hauled his communications team inside the Oval Office to talk about that leak and wanted to stop the leaking and in it asks her says who do you think is doing the leaking and she blames her boss Mercedes shab in slap in front of the President of the United States this in turn obviously gets leaked to Axios via Jonathan Swan and what it captures is just a snake pit that the White House can often be with staffers turning on staffers because the president likes it he wants to know who the leakers are and what's most astonishing is is Kelley Sadler this woman who day who made that McCain remark and who then blamed her boss for the leaking that still has a job at the White House and we say this in almost every episode but in any other White House she wouldn't have a job right this wouldn't this wouldn't happen what's also interesting about all this Jim is that Kelly's that Mercy Schleck was the one who defended Kelly Sadler it seems in that infamous meeting with Sarah Huckabee Sanders when she initially talked about the leaking how she did and got a lot of public flack for it because she said I stand with Kelly but it turns out that they believed least Kelly think said it was Mercedes Schleif who might have been the person to leak it and the reason these leaks matter people might roll their eyes leaks leaks leaks who cares it's just again it sort of speaks to the chaos internally in the distraction that these staffers feel remember the communications team's not that big the the White House itself their to the domestic policy team not that big so when they're engaged in this petty fighting this inward-looking stuff it makes it harder to do all the big things they're trying to do simultaneously on trade and Iran and China and so on and so forth so at this point Jim when you think about it the price is obviously considered one of the biggest leakers there is in the white house is there anything that can be done to try to stop the constant flow of information that is coming from the top down they are there's been I mean the president's been hauling staffer after staffer in to try to sort of put an end to the leaking I think when he hired John Bolton to help run the national security council they started to clean out people that they suspected were leakers and so you can do that but it's such a loose White House and the President himself is so often loose in his conversations with friends and people he's on the phone with that information has a way of almost always working its way out and organizationally sort of business leaders who are watching the show would would get it that like the the tone gets set at the top and when things are loose at the top things tend to be loose at the bottom when people are insecure atop that trickles down and I think you now have this is just part of the culture of the White House hey Jim well we have you I also want to talk about how Axios is looking at the record number of women running for office in the u.s. right now and how this is sort of part of a larger global liberation movement what you guys find yeah really interesting it's a top of Mike's newsletter it's coming out in a couple of minutes that takes a look at you the sea of the me2 movement you have a record number of women running as Democrats and winning by the way in a lot of these primaries as Democrats and you look overseas in Ireland and you see by a two-to-one majority you see largely powered by women overturning the restrictions on abortion in Ireland you have out in Silicon Valley a number of companies now saying that they're gonna reverse their hiring patterns and make sure that 50 percent of employees are female that's never happened before and you have a growing number doing it and I do think that these things aren't happening in isolation that there is a sort of global movement that really is empowering women in all these different sectors and they're playing off of each other all right Jim VandeHei thank you very much we're gonna see you in a little bit on Morning Joe so stick around we're also gonna be reading access a.m. in just a little bit and to all of our viewers out there as well of course you too can sign up for that newsletter at Axios com hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list to see lots of other great videos you
