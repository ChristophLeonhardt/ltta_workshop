You're a mean one
Mr. Philips
You really are a sore
You're As cuddly as a cactus
You're as pretty as a boar
Mr. Phillips.
I don't know why you are so evil
you're Canadian therefore you should be NICE
Why aren't you nice Trevor?
Why aren't you nice?
You're an Asshole
Mr Phillips.
Your heart is
black as coal
You Dress In
womens clothing.
You resemble
an internet troll
Mr.Philips
You seriously have some mother issues Trevor may I suggest getting some therapy.
You're a dumb ass
Mr.Phillips
Youre are as polite
as a Cougar
Its hard to make friends
Probably because
you're a loser
Mr Philips.
Now you're HERE to ruin Christmas
for everyone but yourself you
You're a Dick.
It was the night before Christmas
The snow was in the air
All the citizens were sweet dreaming
All but one who didnt seem to care
Maaaaa see...
These people think their all so clever
All they care about is there presents
they dont care about poor ole trevor
Well This has to change
Say goodbye to all of your shops
GOODBYE DISCOUNT STORE
GOODBYE SUBURBAN
GOODBYE PONSONBYS
GOODBYE MASKS STORE
GOODBYE AMUNATION
GOODBYE TATTOO PARLOR
GOODBYE BARBER SHOP
GOODBYE EVERYTHING!
To Trevor's surprise not a soul was weeping
Maa see, whats going on?
They're probably all still sleeping!
So on he went to see why there wasnt a fuss
To be then greeted my Michael and Franklin who said as thus.
Ahh Trevor you made it! What took you so long? Finally come on in!
shocked for words
he just stood there with a grin.
I dont understand
You should all be mad
You all have no presents everything went to plan...
Trevor Trevor Trevor
We dont care about any presents
All we care about is that all of us are here
all alive and well
But we did get you a little something!
