HOUSE THAT IT WILL WRAP UP BY
THE END OF THIS WEEK?
>> TO REMIND FOLKS IT WAS THE
PRESIDENT THAT SIGNED OFF ON
THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION
BUT HE SAID ALL ALONG HE
BELIEVES DEMOCRATS ARE DOING
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO DELAY
JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION
AND HE EXPECTS TO SEE THAT
CONTINUE.
THE CONCERN IS THAT WITH THIS
WEEK FOR THE F.B.I. TO COMPLETE
THIS BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION
IT GIVES A LOT MORE TIME FOR
ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS TO COME
OUT AND CALLS FOR FURTHER
INVESTIGATION AND DELAYS.
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ARE
CONVINCED THE F.B.I.'S
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION WILL
NOT TURN INTO A FISHING
EXPEDITION.
NO MATTER THE OUTCOME THE
PRESIDENT IS PREDICTING
DEMOCRATS WON'T BE SATISFIED.
ON SUNDAY HE TWEETED WOW,
STARTING TO HEAR THE DEMOCRATS
ONLY THINKING OF OBSTRUCT AND
DELAY ARE STARTING TO PUT OUT
THE WORD THAT THE TIME AND
SCOPE OF THE F.B.I. LOOKING
INTO KAVANAUGH AND WITNESSES
ISN'T ENOUGH.
HELLO?
FOR THEM IT WILL NEVER BE
ENOUGH.
STAY TUNED AND WATCH.
ON 60 MINUTES CHRIS COON SAID
HE BELIEVES THE INVESTIGATION
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
>> I THINK WE'LL BE IN A
DIFFERENT PLACE BECAUSE LOTS OF
SURVIVORS AROUND THE COUNTRY
WILL FEEL THAT DR. FORD'S STORY
WAS HEARD AND RESPECTED AND
FURTHER INVESTIGATED.
WE MAY WELL BE IN A DIFFERENT
PLACE A WEEK FROM NOW BECAUSE
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HIS FAMILY
MAY WELL HAVE HAD EXCULPATORY
EVIDENCE BROUGHT FORWARD.
>> THE F.B.I. IS EXPECTED THE
COMPLETE ITS INVESTIGATION BY
THE END OF THIS WEEK.
>> Bill: DEMOCRATS ARE RAISING
CONCERNS ABOUT THE
INVESTIGATION.
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING TODAY?
>> DEMOCRATS ARE CONCERNED THAT
GIVEN THE LIMITED TIME THAT THE
F.B.I. HAS TO WORK WITH IS THAT
ACTS WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPLETE
THE KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE
BACKGROUND INVEST DEMOCRATS
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.
THEY'VE DONE INVESTIGATIONS
LIKE THIS IN MUCH SMALLER TIME
FRAMES.
WHAT F.B.I. OFFICIALS ARE
TELLING US.
SEVERAL DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ARE
CONCERNED THE WHITE HOUSE IS
LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE
INVESTIGATION TO NOT LOOK INTO
OTHER ALLEGATIONS OR INCIDENTS
AGENTS MAY COME ACROSS.
SARAH SANDERS PUSHED BACK ON
THAT SUGGESTION ON "FOX NEWS
SUNDAY".
>> WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL HAS
ALLOWED THE SENATE TO DICTATE
WHAT THE TERMS LOOK LIKE AND
WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE
INVESTIGATION IS.
AGAIN, THE WHITE HOUSE ISN'T
INTERVENING.
WE AREN'T MICROMANAGING THIS
PROCESS.
THIS IS SOMETHING -- IT'S A
SENATE PROCESS AND HAS BEEN
FROM THE BEGINNING AND WE'RE
LETTING THE SENATE CONTINUE TO
DICTATE WHAT THE TERMS LOOK
LIKE.
