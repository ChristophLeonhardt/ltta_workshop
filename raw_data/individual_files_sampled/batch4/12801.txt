leave us review okay so now to the news portion of our show so let's talk about what's going on with North Korea so over the last couple of days it's reported that North Korea Kim jong-un who looks like a dog chewed tennis ball that got really pissed at the world i'm kim jong hoon has developed apparently a nuclear weapon that is capable of fitting in a warhead which can be fitted to his ICBMs intercontinental ballistic missiles this of course would give him the capacity to hit los angeles the bad news about that is it would end the show the good news about that is that it would wipe out hollywood but it is really not a great thing that they can hit the united states with their with their missile technology now particularly not with a nuke that is scary stuff and kim jeong-hoon happens to be one crazy loon bad crazy man so none of this is good now the president Trump did something really good over the weekend he got through the UN Security Council a 15/0 resolution to place new sanctions on North Korea that's that's a good thing even China and Russia voted for he's also talking about taking economic measures against China in an attempt to press them to stop their material support for the Kim jong-un regime this seems like a positive move the we're stuck sorted between a rock and a hard place to be completely honest I don't have any easy answers on North Korea because I'm not privy to the military plans I can tell you what the general situation is okay north Korea has 20,000 pieces of ordnance that are pointed at Seoul Seoul is a city of millions of people you could easily see a situation in which the United States launches a military strike Pyongyang and Kim jong-un basically pulls a string and suddenly Seoul 100 200,000 people are dead in the middle of the capital of South Korea I mean it's that close so that obviously is weighing heavily on the minds of the people in national security positions you know you sort of hope that they have better plans than that you sort of hope that they have the capacity to take out all of that ordnance as part of a first strike that if we were going to take out this this regime that we would take out all that ordnance at the same time so that South Korea could live and be well but we've also worked on the installation of the THAAD missile defense system in South Korea you recall that President Trump idiotically early in his administration said we should withdraw funding for that we absolutely should not and have not so that means that that is continued to develop which is a necessary thing so the the North Koreans developed this new weapon they are now talking about having a long-range missile once they have that makes it very difficult for the United States to take a preemptive strike because what happens if as in their death throes the North Koreans fire off their ICBM with a nuke attached to the top of it at Los Angeles right that's that's the problem with them having a nuke another reason why the the Iranian deal is so stupid because the last thing you want is the Iranians to have the capacity to deter any military action by the United States if we feel the necessity to take some but Trump comes out yesterday he's asked about this and he proceeds to basically speak and actually sort of come to a looting type language with regard to what we are going to do to North Korea if they continue to make threats here's what he had to say let's not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen he has been very threatening beyond a normal state and as I said they will be met with fire fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before thank you so everybody took that as him basically making a threat that he's gonna nuke North Korea and that's because of this phrase that he ends at the ends there with you know he could end with we're gonna meet them with fire and fury and emissary of Eva and and of demons and oh we are going to unleash of the power paper out of it right he could have said that but when he says beyond anything we've ever seen that makes it sound like he's actually gonna I mean look at Tom prices face here actually statins like like Trump wants to nuke North Korea and a lot of people are freaked out about that because Trump is unpredictable he doesn't know much about nuclear power I mean he didn't know what the nuclear triad was in the middle of the campaign so people are freaked out about that now I don't take it that seriously I don't think Trump is talking about nuking North Korea and starting some sort of nuclear world war 3 with North Korea he uses that phrase all the time right when he says more than anything we've ever seen before like he says that with regard to his election victory he said that with regard to congressional malfeasance he said that with regard to Obama care and this language of anything we've ever seen before it's just like a throwaway line that he likes to use at the end of things I tweeted yesterday one of the problems of the president who speaks only in superlatives is you actually don't know when he's serious if you constantly are saying everything is the best everything is the grandest like my grandfather was like this very enthusiastic guy my grandpa and Papa used to say everything was the most exciting everything was the best everything was the most incredible and so you never knew whether something was actually great or whether he had just gotten like a scoop of ice cream like he didn't know what the what exactly was happening the same thing is true of Trump he speaks constantly in superlatives and so do you know what he's talking about the answer is really not so much now is that a huge deal not really I mean the fact is that you know everybody's going nuts over this you know people are so he's gonna start World War three no he's not gonna start World War three and the situation in North Korea is not Trump's fault the media is already attempting to place blame at Trump's feet for the situation in North Korea obviously that's not sure I'm gonna go through the history of American malfeasance with regard to North Korea Trump's been on the job like five minutes okay this is not Donald Trump's fault in any real way I do want to show you this meme that a pro Trumper was tweeted at me yesterday and I just thought this was hilarious this is from the last episode of Game of Thrones in case you can't see it and it is Kim Jong Kook sitting there Jaime Lannister that's not make any more threats to the United States they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen riding the dragon kim jong-in sits there looking confused that is pretty spectacular and of course it's true that if we were to get into some sort of actual firefight with North Korea this sucker is over in five minutes I mean the United States took out the third-largest military on planet Earth and Iraq in three weeks you know yes it broke out into an insurgency afterward but if we're just talking about destroying top-down the administration North Korea we could do that in under 15 minutes sebastien Gorka who I think has been mm-hmm I I think he's really been wrongly maligned by a lot of people he's a national security adviser to President Trump who's on sean hannity show last night he says listen North Korea is a lot of bluster and a lot of talk led by a short fat dwarf but but we should really but we should really know that this is a very very weak country is that enough to stop this madman or is he even mad he's just again he likes to cause trouble on the world stage this is not the Cold War remember during the Cold War we had this phrase correlation of forces we had a balance we had a standoff more than 20,000 nuclear warheads on either side this is not the Soviet Union this is a Potemkin village this this regime cannot even feed its own people that's how much of a of a paper tiger it is so now they have to send a very clear message Rex Tillerson today at the ASEAN meeting said they can send a signal no more ballistic missile testing then we will know that sanity reigns and they don't want to bring down the ire of the president and the Western community against North Korea okay so he's obviously correct but the problem is what sort of threat can you actually leverage against North Korea that's credible this is the only problem with Trump's language because Trump says things and then there's no real follow-through you don't know what to take seriously it actually emboldened our enemies in certain ways so for example you see that clip he says if they make any more threats fire fury dragon fire yeah well what's the word that she says when she launches the dragon fire she in any case you know it's it's it's that right that's what Trump is saying and the problem is that North Korea immediately comes out and immediately says well okay fine we're gonna sink Guam right this way rivet they came out they said okay well we'll fire a missile at Guam okay well that's another threat and the United States didn't really have any retaliation for that apparently we're gonna send some missile defense over to Guam um but here's the truth everybody is overheated about all of this so the left is super overheated about all of the CNN says we're all gonna die this this tiny you know stupid country led by you know it's the country's fine but the stupid guy who evil piece of garbage who leads the country he's gonna nuke us all we're all gonna die because he finally has fitted a nuclear warhead to an ICBM even though we don't know the ICBM works we don't know if the warhead works and this guy is basically relegated to getting bad haircuts and killing his relatives in airports with anthrax here is CNN losing its mind right basically doing the 1950's tile everybody get under your desk because we're all gonna have to prep duck and cover for the nuclear attack this picture purports to show Kim jong-un with a miniaturized nuclear weapon people laughed at it when it came out last year but now if they believe this is the real deal what does it show us well it would suggest that this would be about two feet across experts say it might weigh 500 600 pounds something like that and it would have potentially the destructive potential of those bombs that you mentioned which the United States dropped on Japan seventy two years ago this week but look at the difference in size each of these was 10 to 11 feet long weighed around something around 10,000 pounds these had to be carried by a heavy bomber this is a different thing all together in this case maybe you are talking about something that can fit in the nose cone of one of their existing missiles if that is the case it changes the game because their last missile test went 2300 miles up into space way above the space station way above many satellites out there yeah it only went 621 land miles but that's because it basically went straight up and came straight down so I'm scientists say if you flatten out that trajectory if you fire it across the earth then you could reach Guam you could Ruiz Hawaii Alaska and some scientists say based on the weight of the payload in theory they could reach about half of the United States and some major cities in here okay so we're all gonna die everybody be scared now listen is it fine for CNN to show us what North Korea's capacity is sure but they kind of scare tactics that they're using are just ridiculous okay there's a Fareed Zakaria of CNN he comes out and he says the real threat here is Donald Trump and here's here's where the left really loses their mind okay I'm gonna go through the history of the North Korean situation and show you why this is not Trump's fault but the left is basically saying if anything bad here happens it's obviously because of Trump we had blamed Bush and then we had eight years of Obama existing and we don't care about about what Obama did because basically his entire tenure goes into a black hole according to the media it was just sunshine and rainbows for eight years but now Trump is president again and whatever Trump does has to be wrong so here's Fareed Zakaria saying it's just terrible what Trump said about that that crazy little nutjob Kim jong-un what worried me about it is the kind of rhetoric Donald Trump views is the kind of rhetoric the North Koreans use it's not the kind of rhetoric the United States of America uses we are measured we are careful we match our words with deeds we do not go out and say the the you know can make these kind of outlandish claims which frankly will not be met we will not let me confidently say respond to North Korea with fire and fury the kind of which the world has never seen before okay so it's so terrible how could you Donald Trump use this language direct quote Bill Clinton 1993 it would mean the end of their country as they know it it's Bill Clinton who said that about North Korea if they were to use a nuclear weapon would mean the end of their country as they know it okay so apparently you know it's the end of the world if Trump uses this sort of language when Bill Clinton use that sort of language no problem at all another MSNBC analyst says the same thing with Trump he's just like a North Korean leader I mean it's just like that and I make a joke about the sort of language that he uses but they actually take that seriously the president sounds like a North Korean leader Kim jong-il Kim jong-un you know the son of Kim jong-il Kim jong-il they all talked about literally sea of fire that was the the threat that they used more often than not I used to have a huge file folder of all the crazy colorful things that the North Korean would say and the names that they would call our American presidents so President Trump sounds more like a North Korean leader unfortunately than an American leader okay again no not so much is the language overblown of course it's over the wall because that's who Trump is do I wish that General James Madison were in charge of all of our military policy yeah I do but I would be much more comfortable sleeping at night if it were mad as we're making these sorts of comments right madis does say this sort of stuff and you have to take it seriously when Trump says it you know he could be talking about contestants on The Apprentice you just don't know but is this you know the left is so intent on making Trump the bad guy that they're forgetting that Trump actually hasn't done anything wrong here and what he's talking about is perfectly within the realm of possibility no he's not talking about nuclear weapons use the Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that this morning again this is one of the problems with Trump and Twitter as he went on Twitter and then he said well we've modernized our nuclear weapons so in case we have to use them but in real I'll in reality the White House is not seriously talking about any of that now I want to get to the the history of the North Korean situation in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at blue apron so everyone in LA has blue apron everyone in LA is lazy we don't like going to the grocery store we don't know how to shop for things we certainly don't

blue apron comm slash Shapiro and that lets them know that we sent you as well okay so just a final note on the left losing its mind over Trump MSNBC's lawrence O'Donnell who is just an egregiously bad host he came out and he said the big problem here is that both North Korea in the United States have unpredictable wires in charge right it's the same leadership is in North Korea in the United States come on now come on his response to that uniquely bad news for his uniquely incompetent and ineffective administration is to simply lie and to say that his administration has achieved more than most a North Korean regime style lie that's Donald Trump's choice to in terms of describing the accomplishments of his administration and so the Trump administration enters its first deadly serious dangerous international crisis this time with an unpredictable liar in North Korea and for the first time in American history the United States has an unpredictable liar who is in control of the nuclear codes that could instantly create fire and fury like the world has never seen there is no indication that the White House or the president had any intention at all of making any comment about North Korea today what the president did say was in response to a shouted question by a reporter okay so it's just terrible that everything the Trump does is wrong everything Trump does his bad Trump is the real threat you know this is a constant refrain from the left and it's getting very irritating the United States is always the real threat george w bush was a cowboy war monger he was the real threat in the Middle East Israel is the real threat in Europe it's the Europeans who are the real threat it's always the West that's the real threat a trump is the real threat Obama was never the real threat because he was of the left but anybody who is not hardcore left is part of the problem you see it's not just kim jeong-hoon is an evil dictator who's enslaved millions of people inside of his own country starved our people do you understand that the average height of a North Korean is I believe three inches shorter than the average height of a South Korean there are the same genetic stock so why is that it's because of malnutrition in North Korea is a giant garbage if you look at the satellite photos you see at night North South Korea completely lit up you get to North Korea nothing completely black there are no lights anywhere in North Korea except Kim Jong Un's little palace so it's just but don't worry it's Donald Trump who's the real threat this is one of the things that Madden's me about the left because the fact is that even if you're of the left you could acknowledge that in times of national crisis like this in times when you have an evil dictator threatening in the United States maybe you ought to give the president a little bit more credit than to compare him to the evil dictator in a serious way maybe you ought to give him a little more credit because the fact is the United States is still the United States when Barack Obama did something I disagreed with when he went into Libya you know I disagreed with that I thought it was a bad move by President Obama to get rid of Muammar Qaddafi but I never compared Obama to Qaddafi I never thought they were the same person that's insane okay to try and compare the American leader to dictators foreign dictators and suggest that they are of the same piece is really just a way of blaming America for problems around the world with which it had nothing to do now the other thing that's happened here is that there's been this attempt to read Trump back into history oh it's Trump's fault if everything falls apart its Trump's fault Trump has inherited a 50 to sit well really a 60 year bad situation I'm going all the way back we go back into the time machine and talk about the US policy with regard to North Korea because it's always been pretty egregious ly bad so we fight the Korean War the Korean War starts almost right after World War two when the Chinese and and the North Koreans begin to invade South Korea and and then Harry Truman says we have to check that advance and he sends MacArthur to basically stop that here is Harry Truman talking at the time about why the United States has an interest in in in retaining the freedom of South Korea if the Soviet Union really wants peace it can prove it and could have proved it on any day since last June 25th by joining the rest of the United Nations and coming up on the North Koreans to lay down their arms at 1:00 okay so the Harry Truman called on the Russians to stop supporting the North Koreans and the Chinese to stop supporting the North Koreans it never happened and then the Chinese started pouring people across the border MacArthur suggested let's strike China and get this over with right away and Harry Truman said no we're not gonna do that ended up firing MacArthur North Korea survives South Korea ends up surviving through the sacrifice of 50,000 American troops we lost an enormous number of men in South Korea attempting to defend a free South Korea and thank God we did because South Korea's a flourishing Western country today it would be another communist dictatorship hellhole if it weren't for the sacrifice of America's brave men in the armed services during the Korean War the Forgotten war in American history a good war that we fought and retained freedom for millions of people who now live under the threat of a nuclear-armed dictator in North Korea I want to continue with our little history lesson because this is not about Trump okay this is about the West that made the wrong move at every step in the North Korean history but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at

Korean War which ends July 27th 1953 when there's an armistice sign that creates the Korean Demilitarized Zone which separates North Korea from South Korea the conflict was never actually declared a war it was always considered a police action and supposedly to uphold the the ability of the international community to control North Korea well so much for that okay Eisenhower who's the guy who signed the armistice here is that his explanation of why the United States was involved in the Korean War when the enemy struck on that June day of 1950 what did America do it did what is always has done in all these times of peril it appeals to the heroism of its youth this appeal was utterly right and utterly inescapable it was inescapable not only because this was the only way to defend the idea of collective freedom against the savage aggression that appeal was inescapable because there was now in the plight into which we had stumbled no other way to save honor and self-respect the answer to that appeal has been what any American knew it would be it has been sheer valor power on all the Korean mountainsides that each day bear fresh scars of new great okay so then the fact is that the United States intervention is what allowed of South Korea to exist but the reality of Truman's unwillingness to listen to MacArthur's plans to cross the Yalu River and actually strike at the Chinese led both to the continuation of a Chinese regime which continues to oppress a billion people today but also the continuation of the North Korean regime okay fast forward so now we go forward to the Clinton administration so we've had Kim il-sung who is the head of the the Kim family in North Korea and he's been succeeded by Kim jong-il who was the the father of the current kim jong hoon Kim jong-il was the one who gets made fun of in in Team America if you recall and he is developing nuclear weapons and he's developing long-range missile capabilities and built is so concerned about this in 1993 that one of the options that is presented to him is a deal where he would actually put ten thousand more American troops into South Korea we would move battle carriers into the region we'd start evacuating American citizens from that region in preparation possibly for a strike against North Korea and that's when Jimmy Carter goes on CNN without permission of the Clinton administration goes on CNN and he announces on CNN that he's come to an agreement so Jimmy Carter goes freelancing and creates this framework for an agreement and then Bill Clinton goes on TV and takes credit for this garbage framework this is 1994 President Bill Clinton making concessions to an evil terrorist regime before I take your questions I'd like to say just a word about the framework with North Korea that ambassador Dellucci signed this morning this is a good deal for the United States North Korea will freeze and then dismantle its nuclear program South Korea and our other allies will be better protected the entire world will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons South Korea with support from Japan and other nations will bear most of the cost of providing North Korea with fuel to make up for the nuclear energy it is losing and they will pay for an alternative power system for North Korea that will allow them to produce electricity while making it much harder for them to produce nuclear weapons the United States and international inspectors will carefully monitor North Korea to make sure it keeps its commitments only as it does so well North Korea fully join the community of nations none of this crap happened all that happened here was the United States basically rebuilt North Korea's electrical grid work we provided them the material for light nuclear reactors and they continued to covertly create a nuclear weapon and the reason that they continued to do that is because after all the West is just gonna keep capitulating and capitulating and capitulating then the best thing that you can do is ratchet up the amount of weaponry that you have in order to prevent and forestall a military strike on North Korea okay I want to talk about more

conservative podcast in the Nature you so again the media are blaming Trump their CTO Trump is the one who screwed everything up with regard to North Korea okay so we've just shown you how Truman screwed up North Korea how Ike signed an armistice but that armistice led to the continuation of North Korea we've shown you how Bill Clinton screwed up North Korea and then he screws it up further so this is really funny it's funny how the media twist these things I was watching a documentary I think it was done by the New York Times about North Korea and and the nuclear deal that Bill Clinton did and what's really hilarious about this and they try to blame it on Bush so everything has to be blamed on Bush so it's it's so Clinton signs this crappy deal and then they say well congressional Republicans came in and undermined the deal no that's not correct Bill Clinton continued to fund the deal he continued to make concessions and this this ridiculous this ridiculous lawn gnome you know kim jeong-hoon he builds a Kim jong-il his father builds up a missile program continues to build nuclear arms and so Bill Clinton deploys Madeline Albright in the late 90s to go over and give Kim Jong Kim jong-il a basketball and make nice with him listen to how delusional you want to hear as illusional listen to how delusional Madeline Albright the Secretary of State under Bill Clinton was about Kim jong-il at the time I went haven't been briefed on what kind of a weirdo he was from our own people he was portrayed as a reclusive like with many girlfriends and watching porno movies and basically a very weird kind of a person that you had no idea what he was going to be like was actually quite charming while I knew all the terrible things that he had done I could at least make the distinction that he wasn't crazy he was very very well prepared responded without notes was not only respectful but also interested in what I had the talks with secretary Albright lead to a remarkable breakthrough Kim jong-il puts his missile program on the table he offers to and all exports of ballistic missiles he offers to freeze the production deployment and testing of all ballistic missiles with a range of 300 miles or more okay they claim here is that the Clintons were right on the verge of a breakthrough and then Evol George Bush came along and sunk all of that absolute nonsense Kim jong-il was going to continue building these missiles no matter what because he'd been doing so for the past 15 years okay the idea that it was Bush that ruined everything is just absolute hogwash it is absolute nonsense okay and then finally you know the the ill root the Kim regime begins test-firing nuclear weapons and missiles in 2003 2004 Bush declares them part of the axis of evil and now we fast forward to 2009 you want to hear some tough talk that means nothing Barack Obama spent eight years doing nothing about the burgeoning missile capabilities of the North Koreans this is him in 2009 saying don't worry there's gonna be a lot of consequences consequences like like stuff that I say right here from my mouth with words Barack Obama dope North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs pose a grave threat to the peace and security of the world and I strongly condemn their reckless action North Korea's actions endanger the people of Northeast Asia they are a blatant violation of international law and they contradict North Korea's own prior commitments now the United States and the international community must take action in response the record is clear north korea has previously committed to abandoning its nuclear program instead of following through on that commitment it has chosen to ignore that commitment its actions have also flown in the face of United Nations resolutions as a result North Korea is not only deepening its own isolation it's also inviting stronger international pressure yeah clearly that's incredibly so again all of this is nonsense and now here comes Trump aneesa's player in fury and oh my god he's gonna kill us all we're all gonna die okay the chances here are that the North Koreans are just attempting to dissuade the United States from doing all of this if we were to take a pre-emptive military strike if there was that possibility without killing hundreds of thousands of South Koreans it certainly should be on the table and the fact that the United States has for so long and nothing for 50 years done nothing about the burgeoning threat in fact forwarding their nuclear capacity and then saying strong things about meaning anything like one of two things is happening with Trump here either he means it in which case that would be more than presidents for the last five decades of men or he doesn't mean anything in which case he's perfectly with in line with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama but you can't pretend that he is some sort of complete nutcase he's doing something that is random and insane and were the real threat is Donald Trump that's a bunch of leftist claptrap that's a piece of propaganda that is not helpful to the situation Mille at all okay so in other news in non North korea-related news when the big story of the day is that FBI agents have raided the Alexandria home of president Trump's former campaign chairman late last month is according to the Washington Post using a search warrant to seize documents and other materials according to people familiar with the Special Counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election federal agents appear to poem anna fort's home without advance in in the without advance warning in the pre-dawn hours of July 26th the day after he met voluntarily with the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee the search warrant was wide-ranging FBI agents working with Special Counsel Moeller departed the home with various records jason Maloney a spokesman from anna fort confirmed the agents executed a warrant at one of the political consultants homes and that mana fort cooperated with the search ok so the reason that this is very important is because if you actually have a search warrant that requires you to actually demonstrate to a judge probable cause that is how you actually get a search warrant legally that means probable cause that you think a crime has been committed the chances are very good that palm anaphora is gonna end up on the wrong end of an indictment here and that in turn is going to be a problem for Trump because Trump he was Trump's campaign manager for three months in the middle of the campaign and Trump is gonna claim that he didn't know anything the manna fort was doing we still don't know if the prosecute no mana for it would have to do with his activities during the campaign or whether it was just him doing illegal stuff outside the campaign that has yet to be seen but it's a cloud looming over the Trump administration and again hard to say that mana Ford isn't guilty of anything or that it's a witch-hunt of Mana for when it's been clear for years that Paul Manafort is is deeply embedded and involved with the Russian government I mean again I told you about this I was I was approached by somebody back in like 2012 I think now to write columns about Ukraine and he dropped Paul mana for its name he had pitched me think one column about Ukraine without dropping mana for two name I wrote the column because I thought it was an interesting pitch and then he mentioned mana for its name and I looked into it I was like no we're not doing any of this anymore we're not gonna do any of these things and mana Ford has long been a Kremlin stooge essentially so this would not be any great shock but it has the potential to dirty up the Trump campaign you could certainly see a situation in which people say Trump's campaign manager Paul Manafort that he is a that he was a Russian stooge Trump was working with him because he was a Russian stooge you know it's just too early to say so before we all go off on the witch-hunt tangent and say that Muller is exceeding his grasp right here manna forts been serving for a long time and this is not a great shock I've said for months and if anybody in the Trump campaign was gonna come down with criminal indictments it's probably gonna be manna fort and then the question was gonna be what's it Trump no one's did he know it and what activities was manna fort engaged and with regards to the campaign so before the media jumps to Trump's guilty of everything and before the right jumps to the Trump is guilty of nothing routine let's hear the evidence that's presented I think that's a reasonable position okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate and then I'll do a short Bible talk so things I like we've been doing books about communism so George Orwell's most famous book about communism is 1984 it's funny the left keeps saying well it's not about communism it's about fascism guys it's about communism George Orwell also wrote Animal Farm which is clearly about communism and he wrote what I think actually his best book a book called homage to Catalonia and it is about how George Orwell himself went and embedded with the communist troops in the Spanish Civil War and he gradually realized that he was fighting on behalf of some bad guys that yes the fascists were bad but so are the Communists an homage to catalonia is all about his gradual realization that he was fight on the side of people who wanted some pretty evil and egregious things it's I think his best written book I really love homage to Catalonia it's a forgotten classic you should go and check it out at amazon.com it is as the New Yorker says probably the best book on the Spanish Civil War and Orwell is just a terrific writer I mean everything Orwell wrote is worth reading and this book is like seriously nobody ever looks at this book and you should because it's but I think it's better than 1984 I think it's better than Animal Farm okay time for some things that I hate so Stephen Miller I was on TV last night one of the things I cannot stand is just the level of sycophants II of some people in the Trump administration toward Trump it's just it's off-putting it's egregious it demonstrates that this is all the Trump cares about and that's really gross so yesterday there was a report that Trump every morning has delivered to him in a folder basically a propaganda folder that has in it news clippings about how wonderful he is headlines about how great he is and then also pictures of himself looking tough on the news seriously okay that's not good that's not good okay that's the kind of narcissism that leads to bad decision-making and then you have members of his communication staff going on TV and seeing how deeply they can bury their nose in his ass in order to elevate themselves in in Trump's mind so they're performing for an audience of one Stephen Miller who's a very smart guy I know Stephen you know Stephen who is a policy wonk when it comes to immigration he's done Tucker Carlson last night and he unleashes this broadside of inanity with regard to president Trump's myriad qualities president Trump's the most gifted politician of our time and he's the best orator to hold that office in generations and so we're going to take the message out to the people because you said he is the leader of this nationwide and worldwide populist movement okay really is the greatest orator in modern history really is he he's the greatest politician of our time amazing stuff amazing stuff from Stephen Miller in fact we have a clip of Stephen Miller this back in the 1950s when Stephen Miller was defending a guy he used to serve in the army with named Raymond Shaw we have some clips of him and Sarah Huckabee Sanders and other members of the Trump administration talking about this Raymond Shaw character Raymond Shaw is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being out of a nought of my life Raymond Shaw is the bravest kindest warmest most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life I said Raymond Shaw is the kindest warmest bravest most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life from the Manchurian Candidate in that movie these people have actually been brainwashed in Manchuria by the Chinese government because Raymond Shaw is actually a Chinese spy that of course it's not what is happening here but really can we cut out the sick of NC like mister mr. president I say I give you a piece of advice yesterday it was shut up let your administration to its job because when that happens good things happen when another piece of advice please tell your comms people they don't have to go on TV and reenact the first scene from King Lear where King Lear's daughters go up before King Lear and just and just kiss his ass like please just stop it because it's a bad look it doesn't make you look any better you think that it helps the American people it doesn't help the American people it makes it look like you are self-absorbed and we don't like self-absorbed presidents as a general rule it doesn't end well for them okay other things that I that I hate today so Roy Moore is one of the candidates for Alabama Senate and he is and he ran an ad slamming what he calls the DC slot machine roy moehner is a very conservative candidate and he is running against a guy named Luther strange Luther strange is the interim senator from Alabama who filled the slot left by Jeff Sessions when he became Attorney General of the United States President Trump yesterday came out and endorsed Roy Moore's opponent in this race he endorsed instead of remor he endorsed Luther strange the current sense from senator who is very much in bed with Mitch McConnell Roy Moore is a much better candidate and and it's it's sad to me that Luther strange when fortunately does not have the power to control time and space dr. strange but minee the president Trump endorsed the wrong guy here is some of Roy Moore's yeah this is the guy who should be in runoff her son and Alabama they lied about repealing Obamacare damage McConnell's DC slime machine spending millions spreading lies about Roy Moore bearing false witness why we know why no remorse honest and more zone man more fears God stands for the Constitution fights for what is right and believes what we believe drain the swamp send McConnell a message send them all a message ROI more Senate my name's Roy Moore and I approve this message okay so Trump endorsed not Roy Moore by Mitch McConnell's handpick Luther strange again bad move its Alabama whoever wins the Republican nomination is gonna win the seat and and Trump sided with the establishment this is not training this one okay final thing that I hate Ashley Judd is very angry because apparently she was at the airport and some dude called her called her sweetheart I guess and this is this is just terrible no man should ever call a woman sweetheart under any circumstances these you just call them I guess nasty name so here's here's Ashley Judd getting very very upset I'm traveling today and this is the kind of thing to me that happens which I categorized as everyday sexism and it's so easy to let it go not to speak up particularly when it's so easy for someone to push back and say oh I was just being polite or something like that so it was coming through security and a guy said hey sweetheart and I said I'm not your sweetheart I am your client so I was already setting the boundary what a nasty person like somebody says sweetheart there are two ways to say sweetheart ones like a sweetheart like did - meaning okay another is just to say sweetheart like you're just talking to a person like when an older man talks to a younger woman that's fairly common like my dad when he talks to younger woman when he talks to younger women who he's being friendly to sometimes he'll just say he'll say sweetheart just like a nice thing like my dad is the cleanest guy I know I mean it's just it's insane for Ashley Judd to get like there's so many things to be offended over in the world there's so many things to be angry over in the world somebody calling you sweetheart or holding the door open for you is not the thing to be offended over if this offends you it's because you're a sad small human being okay really first of all ask any dude if they'd be offended if a girl called them the sweetheart okay the answer is no if a girl called the dude sweetheart we'd be like that's kind of Awesome like it'd be nice if women treated us nicely on a daily basis that'd be pretty spectacular so just just ridiculous from Ashley but the feminist movement is is Don Quixote in search of a windmill and so they will continue to vault at those windmills okay so final final thing we are going to do a quick quick quick Bible review today so this is from Isaiah chapter 50 so every week the Jews read a portion of the Torah and then we also read a portion from the prophets and the writings and this is this week's portion says the Lord God opened my ear I did not rebel I did not turn away backwards I gave my back to smite errs and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair I did not hide my face from embarrassments and spitting but the Lord God helps me therefore I was not embarrassed therefore I made my face like flint and I knew I would not be ashamed so it's interesting because this obviously priests sages the the New Testament section where it talks about turning the other cheek right I mean this is pretty clear language where he says that he turns his cheeks to people who plucked off his hair you know what he's saying here is not the you not you should not speak the truth or that you should give leeway to bad people who harm you what he is saying is that you should not feel spiritually insulted when people say the wrong thing to you should be strong enough in your values and when people say things that are not true about you you shouldn't take it to heart you shouldn't be embarrassed you should make your face like flint you shouldn't accept the criticism as meaning that you're a lesser human being you should understand that being tough in the name of God you know being tough on behalf of judeo-christian values these things are should give you strength and should give you the inner strength to know that if people slap you okay so whatever they slap you a big deal big deal you're stronger than that your values are stronger than that he whom indicates you is near whoever wishes to quarrel with you let us stand together whoever as my contender shall approach me the Lord God shall help me who is he that will condemn me behold all of them shall wear out with garment a moth shall consume them and this is right people who espouse the wrong values in life they do tend to wear out pretty quickly and so do those values as we are seeing every day from the from the international hard left ok so we'll be back here tomorrow hopefully there won't be a nuclear war in the meantime that would be unfortunate I would hate to - for the world to end while I'm number 2 - Oprah on iTunes now just be sad so let's make me number 1 on iTunes and then if there's a nuclear war I think we all can can live with that end of the world I think we can okay i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
