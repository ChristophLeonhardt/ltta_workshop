she started a petition for Darsh ankang to resign and she joins me now to discuss well Sheila first off how popular is mr. kang in that writing you know it was a pretty close riding for dharshan kang i think right now the sentiment in the writing would be if they had a choice they would choose someone else and really that's all I want I want the people of Sky View to be allowed to go back to a by-election and choose if they want to choose darshakon great if they don't even better but they should be given that choice and right now with the House of Commons rules there's no mechanism by which to remove him so we have to put the pressure on Darsh and kang to fire himself indeed and it doesn't appear that he's gonna do that she'll up but you know what I'm fascinating is that when you drill down to the nitty-gritty of something that essentially began is that he said she said kind of conflict I noticed that there was nine main allegations and not all the allegations could be proven but what I found really interesting is that the investigators say found that it was improper for Kang to have physically touched Miss Bossy and there was evidence that inappropriate conduct took place now here's the thing Sheila what is the nature of that evidence I mean is it a surveillance video footage they wouldn't say I don't know if it's text messages or if there's video surveillance or if she you know had made an initial outcry to someone else but a pretty lengthy House of Commons investigation determined that there had been inappropriate touching and that he had tried to get into her hotel room a couple of different times I mean that's outrageous behavior and even more but for lack of a better term sinister Darsh and kang doesn't feel like any of that was wrong like he figures that you know the House of Commons investigation basically said you know he he didn't even realize that trying to do those things would be in a pro that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
