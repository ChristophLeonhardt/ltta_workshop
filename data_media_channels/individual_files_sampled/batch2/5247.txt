welcome back if last week taught us anything it's that a whole year's worth of news can come in a single day or even a single hour and while we probably won't have another day like last Tuesday anytime soon when Paul Manafort was convicted of tax and bank fraud at nearly the same time Michael Cohen was pleading guilty to fraud and campaign violations this could be another headline-making week for Robert Muller's investigation after all the midterms are a little more than two months away and the Justice Department urges its prosecutors to avoid making moves that could be perceived as political close to election day look do we expect Muller to wrap up his investigation in the next few weeks no but can we see new indictments new guilty pleas new subpoenas that's a distinct possibility and as for what molars next move may be as the New York Times puts it the answer might lie and a by-the-book past with me now is Matt Apuzzo the New York Times reporter who wrote that story is also an MSNBC contributor Matt I realized you don't entirely agree with this idea that Muller might have a a blockbuster week this week because he's got to go silent until the midterms but what if you can if you can for me explain the general thinking for why Muller might lay low for the next two months well I mean the general thinking is that Rudy Giuliani has floated September 1st as some sort of deadline the truth is is that the the guidelines that are put forward by pretty much every Attorney General say don't bring election related crimes don't bring election related charges close to an election unless there's a compelling need to do so because what you want to do is you want to avoid the appearance that you're trying to steer the outcome of investigation I mean the outcome of an election sorry and that is absolutely a guiding principle I'm not totally sure that it would that it would come into into play here in the in the midterms it's not usually construed in such a broad way that you can't bring any kind of any kind of political case close to Election Day it would be construed more narrowly specific candidate was running but even in the case against head Stevens they brought that in the final days of a campaign they indicted him so I just don't I don't see any indication that Bob Muller who is famously impatient and does not like meandering investigations I don't see any indication that he is going to sit on his hands come September 1st and say let's let's all Reeve it lets all regroup after November so could we see indictments on October 25th on on November 3rd I think that if if Bob Muller it has an indictment teed up for instance let's let's talk about Roger stone Roger stone the longtime Trump advisor is clearly under investigation Muller's team has a grand jury impaneled is hearing testimony from witnesses related to Roger stones can his activities if the if the Muller team wanted to move forward with an indictment against Roger stone in October hypothetically I'm not totally sure how that would trigger any kind of you know prohibition against making a move because it would somehow influence the outcome of the midterms and again that's also not a decision that Muller necessarily would get to make he can have to consult with career prosecutors at DOJ and they'd have to consult with rod Rosenstein so I think it's absolutely possible that that Muller makes additional moves before Election Day and I think what you can be certain of what I know from Muller and from covering him is that they are going to press forward and they are not going to set any kind of arbitrary deadline Rudy Giuliani is trying to set an arbitrary deadline or at least it seems like an arbitrary deadline that September first deadline as you mentioned a moment ago he's also saying this and this was a tweet from Saturday just a few days before 60-day run up to 2018 elections if Muller wants to show he's not partisan then issue report on collusion and obstruction they will show president Trump nothing wrong then we will have to admit you were fair and we will first of all that argument makes absolutely no sense it's a heads I win tails you lose argument he's only gonna decide if Muller is fair bowler exonerates the president right and I think what you're seeing here is Giuliani is really laying bare the strategy he's saying we've put out this 60-day deadline we try to make it sound like it is some sort of hard and fast rule and if Muller does something after September first then we can say Muller is breaking with precedent which he wouldn't be and it Muller's not playing by the rules and Muller's political so I mean them putting the you know the Trump team establishing September 1st is this kind of lying in the sand it's really just a public relations move because anything that he makes any move that Muller makes after that they can point back to the line and say you cross the line and nobody will remember wait a minute is the Trump team that drew the line in the first place Roger stone is out there and he's talking about the investigation and who knows what his goal is here maybe it's to potentially get some of the heat off of himself but he's claiming that he's got excellent sources that the special counsel is going to charge Don Jr in a crime do you have any indication that Don Jr might be in legal trouble imminently I mean that's obviously not anything we've reported Roger stone I guess has good sources in the in the FBI it seems but I would say that we know we know that we know that Don Donald Trump jr. his conduct is under scrutiny by the the FBI and by the special counsels office we know that members of Congress have raised questions about whether he was truthful in his in his testimony for Congress and if he wasn't that would implicate federal crime and so certainly the other indication we have is that Bob Muller has not interviewed as far as we know Donald Trump jr. and usually you wait for the end to invest to interview your your targets or your most important subjects so we have obviously signs that that the special counsel is looking at Donald Trump Jr's activities we have no indication that he's a target or putative defendant and certainly I don't have any information that supports what Roger stone is saying about the fact that he's going to be indicted but why would a girl II wait to see what what comes of Roger stones reporting Matt Apuzzo all the way from Brussels get some sleep my friend hello youtubers if you're watching this it
