only the federal government could melt Canada's winter pastime write down the money drain I'll tell you how remember that iconic line from Field of Dreams yeah if you construct a baseball diamond in the middle of an Iowa cornfield the reincarnated Shoeless Joe Jackson might show up for one more game of hardball but in Ottawa where so many of our tax dollars go to die we can paraphrase that line to read if you build it they will pay the it is a temporary ice rink the they are you as an any taxpayer busting his or her hiney just to make ends meet alas and alack Justin Trudeau's Canada 150 winter vanity project namely that temporary ice rink on Parliament Hill has cost taxpayers 5.6 million dollars it was supposed to wrap up this month but no we're going into overtime with this one folks with the feds spending another 2.5 million to keep this rink operating through the month of February that's right somehow the federal government figured out a way to squander almost $90,000 per day to keep an outdoor skating rink open how is it even possible that the off the lot price of this rink has now ballooned to 8.1 million dollars indeed when we visited Ottawa in early December for our fire Bill Morneau campaign we drop by the rink naturally because it's a federal government project it was already over budget and way past deadline check it out well folks I'm standing here on Parliament Hill in Ottawa right in front of what is perhaps the most infamous hockey rink in Canada now you know I tried to get the idea for erecting a temporary hockey rink it is after all the 100th anniversary of the NHL it is the successful centennial of our great nation of Canada it's just the cost so far this rink is costing us 5.6 million dollars that was originally to run for just three weeks in other words almost two million dollars per week and also get a load of the rules I mean only an Ottawa bureaucrat could come up with this even though it's a hockey rink there won't be hockey permitted there won't be racing permitted there even be bigger skating allowed sounds like a lot of fun but in any event 5.6 million dollars for a temporary ice rink where you can't do all the things you'd like to do in an ice rink yeah your tax dollars hard at work yet again in any event according to a Canadian heritage that additional 2.5 million dollar February fee is needed to cover operational expenses such as staffing and labor and snow removal as well as administrative cost marketing social media and website support look full disclosure I've I've skated in numerous rinks heck I was the 1981 first-round draft choice of the LA Kings after all that said I know absolutely nothing about ice rink management yet I really really think I could maintain a temporary outdoor rink for less than $90,000 a day I really do and I'd love to hear from anyone in ice rink management to educate me on operating cost because I have a hunch that the daily operating cost of an outdoor rink should not be equivalent to the price of a Porsche Cayenne in the meantime maybe someone should make a movie about this part comedy part tragedy forget Field of Dreams how does rink of scheme sound the ice is gonna break break the budget that is for the rebel dot media I'm David the men's own Menzies hey folks if you like that commentary please consider becoming a premium subscriber and never miss another rebel video you
