1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,250
“I believe that
I am championing

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,290
the Second Amendment
in the 21st century.”

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
This is the man who’s
trying to disrupt

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,760
the U.S. firearms industry

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,820
and test the limits 
of the First Amendment.

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,670
“I think access to the firearm
is a fundamental human dignity.

7
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,079
It’s a fundamental human right.”

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,200
30-year-old Cody Wilson 
is a self-described

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,620
gun rights advocate and 
crypto-anarchist,

10
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,670
which means he believes
in decentralization

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,870
of information.

12
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,360
He’s also been 
labeled one of the

13
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,260
most dangerous people
in the world.

14
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,680
“It’s become kind of 
culturally edgy

15
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
in the gun world

16
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,300
to have your own
ghost gun.”

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,310
Wilson started 
Defense Distributed in 2012

18
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,150
and later used it
to share the plans

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,600
for one of the
first, functioning

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,850
3-D printed guns,
a plastic pistol

21
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,327
he called “The Liberator.”

22
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,040
Now he’s trying to let anyone
download blueprints

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,580
to make guns at home.

24
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:52,950
“Defense Distributed’s goal
isn’t really personal armament —

25
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,359
it’s more the
liberation of information.

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,920
It’s about living in
a world where you just

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,480
download the file
for the thing

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,680
you want to make 
in this life.”

29
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,570
Wilson claims that it’s
his First Amendment right

30
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,820
to upload blueprints 
for firearms

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,300
ranging from handguns
to AR-15 rifles.

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,980
But critics say his methods are
a form of open-source terrorism.

33
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,360
Plastic firearms will
be able to slip

34
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,590
through metal detectors.

35
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,300
Guns printed without
serial numbers

36
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,040
will be difficult to trace.

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,690
And some fear the
mass production of

38
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,690
unregulated firearms could
fall into the wrong hands.

39
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,720
Defense Distributed first
published its blueprints

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,820
online in 2013.

41
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,860
The Obama administration
ordered the company

42
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,249
to pull its files.

43
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:32,040
But the designs had
already been downloaded

44
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,270
more than 100,000 times.

45
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:37,340
Since then, Defense Distributed 
has been embroiled

46
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,200
in a multiyear 
legal battle.

47
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,426
Although the 
Trump administration

48
00:01:41,426 --> 00:01:42,796
appeared to 
have cleared the way

49
00:01:42,796 --> 00:01:44,620
for Wilson to publish his blueprints,

50
00:01:44,620 --> 00:00:00,000
his multiyear 
legal battle is ongoing.
