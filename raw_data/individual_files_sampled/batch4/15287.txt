well let me tell our viewers why you here I'm excited to announce oh you will be I think we've announced it by our website but I don't know if I mentioned it on the show that you are coming to the rebel live yes a Saturday to do a politically incorrect comedy which will be interesting because if I'm doing politically incorrect comedy for people who are against political correctness will it have the same punch you know what I write I make a prediction is that people are gonna be so refreshed by having someone tell jokes I mean let me tell you a pet peeve of mine this hour has 22 minutes and I know I casually know a couple of the people right boy they love making fun of Donald Trump but he's not the president of Canada that's true and so they're they're very bold about mocking the powerful in another country I've never seen them take a really good hard run a Justin Trudeau and I think it's because they work for the state broadcaster well this is the thing and I work for the state broadcaster on occasion as well and I have noticed everything I've ever done for the CBC when I listen back to it for some reason only the left speaker is working you know can I ask you I throw some mention and sure I'm not a scholar on this subject but I'm interested in it I wanna learn more all right my understanding is that historically the role of the court jester or the fool right was not just for entertainment but he had a special immunity that he could say things to the King right that no one else was allowed to do because it was just joking and so he had an incredibly important role in that he could basically be the one saying the emperor has no clothes like if everyone was afraid to tell the King something right the fool could say it in a tada goofy ridiculous joke and the King would say oh alright and I'm not going to kill you because you have the special yes that apparently is the original role of the Jester and that it was speaking truth to power and he was the only one who could get away with it because he was the Jester but not on Game of Thrones if you were I mean rather you lose your tongue of your head that's right I mean I wanted to study that a little bit more but but that's an incredibly important thing and and we need them losing I think we are because of all the pre censorship and the issue that that Chris Rock Jerry Seinfeld all they have with these these colleges is that they're so left dominated that you can't go into a comedy show without them saying now you may be triggered by this yeah you know you might be offended oh yeah I might be yeah but it might not yeah and if you want to be but maybe don't go to come anything but why get one of those adult coloring books that are wrong yes frustrate me well listen I can hardly wait to see it now by the way besides doing the rebel live yes the Simon absolute comedy all this week absolute Oh where's that located at Yonge and Eglinton and I don't know if this is gonna go out in time but if you want to see the Thursday night show call and make a reservation use the code Canadian one and arrive Thursday half an hour before showtime you get your tickets for half price that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch the daily show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
