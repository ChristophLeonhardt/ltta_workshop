Donald Trump had quite the busy weekend on Twitter unfortunately that was the only thing he really did over the weekend aside obviously from playing golf since becoming president Donald Trump has now spent a grand total of two months out of eight months playing golf he spent three months out of eight months at a Trump branded property here in the United States and yet somehow in between rounds of golf this past weekend he had not only the time but the audacity to attack the mayor of San Juan Puerto Rico as in grateful questioning not only her work ethic but the work ethic of all Puerto Ricans saying that they're lazy in that they want things done for them because they're not willing to do it themselves and he attacked the leadership of the mayor of San Juan a woman who was waiting through almost chest high water with a bullhorn looking for survivors in the flooded areas while Donald Trump was out there playing golf and he had the gall to attack her leadership he had the gall to call Puerto Ricans lazy because they're literally begging for FEMA or the federal government or someone to come in and help them because the majority of them do not have drinking water there may or may not according to reports be cholera in the streets because of the flood water that is contaminating people the morgues in Puerto Rico are at full capacity because they can't handle any more dead bodies but you golfer in chief tweeter in chief are the real leader here now you failed by every imaginable measure this crisis in Puerto Rico proves what a disgusting little horrible waste of oxygen kind of human being you truly are mr. Trump you're pathetic you're weak you don't know what you're doing you're not smart enough to do this job you have no leadership abilities to speak of so you attack the leadership qualities of others the only way you feel better about your is by dragging others through the mud which they were literally already sloughing through to save other human beings lives would you do that now what you did was dedicate the golf trophy of this past weekend to the victims in Puerto Rico as if that's somehow going to help them what are you gonna fill it up with clean water and let everybody come around and get a spoonful of it that's about the only way that might possibly even help you're a piece of crap that's the bottom line here folks that's what we're dealing with and I'm tired of dancing around the issue and beating around the bush Donald Trump is a piece of crap and as tweets this past weekend about the good people of Puerto Rico and that mayor of San Juan proved it without a doubt
