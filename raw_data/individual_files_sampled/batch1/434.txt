for two years the people of Fallujah have been struggling to rebuild much of the city was destroyed in 2016 there's a rocky forces battled ISIL fighters some residents who lived through the devastation say little has changed electricity and services are so weak in the city as for the compensation there is no neighborhoods are almost entirely devastated my house is completely destroyed but I haven't received any fair compensation that compensation is vital for people who've lost jobs businesses and homes they say the money isn't always fairly distributed we haven't had fair compensation so far our house was destroyed and the entire neighborhood was leveled to the ground compensation is being granted only for those who have ties with the corrupt officials those who have no connection as sometimes getting half the compensation they should get Fallujah in the center of Iraq has been a battleground for decades suffering some of the highest casualty numbers in the 1991 Gulf War in 2004 US forces invaded and fought gunmen from control of the city after the fall of Saddam Hussein by spring 2014 large areas had been seized by ISIL fighters two years later Fallujah was freed after a long siege by the Iraqi army but much of it had been destroyed the local government says it's rebuilding as fast as it can and that's giving some Iraqis hope for the future but they're definitely median people when we got back to Fallujah after the liberation we saw so much destruction we estimated at least five years for the total reconstruction of Fallujah now we're seeing some sort of efforts to rebuild the reconstruction of Fallujah is part of a bigger building program in Iraq which is being managed from here in Baghdad at the Ministry of construction and housing budgets are tight and it's up to the individual cities to manage the money they get new projects are needed to improve things after ISIL and also to fix the huge damage that affected the city as whole this would require much support from the central government but getting the proper compensation would help more people in Fallujah live from day to day Rob Matheson al-jazeera
