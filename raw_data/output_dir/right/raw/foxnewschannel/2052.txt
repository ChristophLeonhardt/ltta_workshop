1
00:00:00,873 --> 00:00:01,840
AND THEY WILL ANNOUNCE THAT

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,975
SOON.

3
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:05,143
>> Julie: MORE COMING.

4
00:00:05,143 --> 00:00:05,510
ALL RIGHT.

5
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:06,178
RICH EDSON, THANK YOU.

6
00:00:06,178 --> 00:00:09,314
>> Bill: I WANT TO BRING IN

7
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:11,617
SENATOR TIM SCOTT.

8
00:00:11,617 --> 00:00:13,385
REPUBLICAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.

9
00:00:13,385 --> 00:00:14,786
GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK ON THE

10
00:00:14,786 --> 00:00:15,120
PROGRAM.

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,389
TO ME IT STRIKES AS MORE PUBLIC

12
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:17,823
NEGOTIATIONS.

13
00:00:17,823 --> 00:00:20,392
HOW DO YOU REACT TO THAT WORD

14
00:00:20,392 --> 00:00:21,093
FROM PYONGYANG?

15
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:23,562
>> I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.

16
00:00:23,562 --> 00:00:25,831
THE REALITY IS SIMPLE.

17
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:28,100
THAT THE LAST 30 YEARS PLUS

18
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,735
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN TRYING TO

19
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:31,136
FIND A WAY TO DECEIVE THE

20
00:00:31,136 --> 00:00:32,604
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE REST OF

21
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:34,206
THE WORLD INTO ASSUMING THEY

22
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:36,308
WILL GIVE UP THEIR NUCLEAR

23
00:00:36,308 --> 00:00:37,242
WEAPONS, NUCLEAR PROGRAM IF WE

24
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:38,410
DO FILL IN THE BLANK.

25
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:41,280
THE REALITY OF IT IS THE BULLY

26
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,685
FROM NORTH KOREA FINALLY MET A

27
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:48,253
PRESIDENT HE COULDN'T DECEIVE.

28
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:50,622
IT'S WHY HE IS COMING TO THE

29
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:50,923
TABLE.

30
00:00:50,923 --> 00:00:51,790
THE PRESIDENT HAS NEGOTIATED

31
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,626
THE TERMS OF COMING TOGETHER

32
00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:56,261
AND APPLYING MORE SANCTIONS AND

33
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:57,429
ISOLATING NORTH KOREA WE FIND

34
00:00:57,429 --> 00:00:58,830
THEM COMING CLOSER TO THE TABLE

35
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,900
BUT WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS IN

36
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,601
OUR OPTIMISM.

37
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:08,907
WE CAN'T SEND A SIGNAL WE'RE

38
00:01:08,907 --> 00:01:09,641
HAPPY THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER

39
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,009
COMING TO THE TABLE.

40
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,812
HE NEEDS TO SIT DOWN, HAVE A

41
00:01:13,812 --> 00:01:15,681
CONVERSATION AND SHOW US

42
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:19,885
DISCERNIBLE STEPS TAKEN TO

43
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:21,086
DENUCLEARIZE THE DMZ.

44
00:01:21,086 --> 00:01:22,955
WITHOUT THAT CONTINUE TO APPLY

45
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,389
THE PRESSURE AND INCREASE

46
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:25,123
SANCTIONS AGAINST THE NORTH

47
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:26,825
KOREAN REGIME.

48
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:30,162
>> Bill: YOU COULD BE SPOT ON.

49
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:33,765
DO YOU THINK MAC THORNBERRY WAS

50
00:01:33,765 --> 00:01:34,900
RIGHT SAYING THAT MAYBE KIM

51
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,835
JONG-UN HAS WHAT HE NEEDS IN

52
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:39,671
TERMS OF A IN NUCLEAR DEVELOPED

53
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:40,138
PROGRAM.

54
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:42,507
>> THEY'VE MADE A LOT OF

55
00:01:42,507 --> 00:01:43,275
ADVANCEMENTS SINCE THEY STARTED

56
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:47,112
PLAYING GAMES IN THE EARLY 90s

57
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:48,080
WITH PRESIDENTS SAYING THEY

58
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,715
WOULD STEP AWAY FROM THE

59
00:01:49,715 --> 00:01:50,048
PROGRAM.

60
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,817
BUYING MORE TIME TO DO MORE

61
00:01:51,817 --> 00:01:52,751
DEVELOPMENT AND RESEARCH AND

62
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,519
FRANKLY THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB

63
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:55,687
AT KEEPING US AT BAY.

64
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:57,923
THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE FINALLY

65
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,558
PUSHING THEM THROUGH THE TABLE

66
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,426
THROUGH ISOLATION AND ECONOMIC

67
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:01,793
SANCTIONS.

68
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,061
IF WE ALL WANT WORLD PEACE THE

69
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:06,665
BEST WAY TO GET THERE IS APPLY

70
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:10,401
THE KIND OF PRESSURE THAT

71
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,370
REQUIRES THE NORTH KOREAN

72
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,005
REGIME TO BRING BACK THE

73
00:02:13,005 --> 00:02:14,172
CURTAINS AND LET US WATCH

74
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:16,341
CLOSELY WHAT THEY DO NEXT.

75
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:18,577
LET US NOT LISTEN TO THE WORDS

76
00:02:18,577 --> 00:02:21,213
OF THE REGIME, LET US WATCH THE

77
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:21,680
ACTIONS.

78
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,848
>> Bill: ONE MORE QUESTION ON

79
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,750
THIS AND I THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY

80
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,050
RIGHT.

81
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,385
I THINK THE SANCTIONS WORKED

82
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:27,786
AND THE CHINESE PRESSURE HAS

83
00:02:27,786 --> 00:02:29,187
WORKED AND THE MILITARY

84
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:31,356
PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF THE

85
00:02:31,356 --> 00:02:32,524
PRESIDENT AND JAMES MATTIS HAVE

86
00:02:32,524 --> 00:02:33,925
WORKED SO FAR AND WHAT'S ALL

87
00:02:33,925 --> 00:02:34,659
DRIVING THIS.

88
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,128
DO YOU THINK THIS PRESIDENT

89
00:02:36,128 --> 00:02:38,163
WOULD SACRIFICE SOME OF THE

90
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,398
13,000 U.S. TROOPS SERVING IN

91
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:41,199
SOUTH KOREA TO DRAW DOWN THAT

92
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:42,167
NUMBER IN ORDER TO POSSIBLY

93
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,803
MAKE A DEAL IN THE END?

94
00:02:44,803 --> 00:02:47,139
>> I REALLY DON'T THINK SO.

95
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,340
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN

96
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,743
PRETTY CLEAR ON THEIR

97
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:52,911
OPPOSITION TO REMOVING OUR

98
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:53,245
TROOPS.

99
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,780
THAT DOES NOT MAKE THE WORLD

100
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,247
SAFER.

101
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:59,518
IT DOES NOT MAKE THE KOREAN

102
00:02:59,518 --> 00:03:00,952
PENINSULA SAFER, IT CREATES

103
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:02,120
MORE VOLATILITY AND REDUCES THE

104
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,390
AMOUNT OF SECURITY WHICH I

105
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,658
THINK EMBOLDENS THE NORTH

106
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:07,259
KOREAN REGIME.

107
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:09,594
IF PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS IS

108
00:03:09,594 --> 00:03:11,463
A REQUIREMENT THAT WE REMOVE

109
00:03:11,463 --> 00:03:12,864
OUR TROOPS, THAT IS BAD NEWS

110
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:14,499
FOR SOUTH KOREA AND EVEN WORSE

111
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:15,700
NEWS FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THE

112
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,736
WORLD.

113
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:20,105
COMING UP IN SIX MONTHS AND I'M

114
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,440
CERTAIN YOU'RE WELL AWARE.

115
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,075
>> I'VE HEARD OF IT.

116
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,743
>> Bill: THE HILL HAS A

117
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:25,210
HEADLINE TODAY.

118
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,911
SHOW IT FIRST.

119
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:28,947
I WANT TO POINT THIS OUT.

120
00:03:28,947 --> 00:03:30,816
DEMS FACE PRESSURE TO FOCUS ON

121
00:03:30,816 --> 00:03:31,383
ECONOMY, NOT TRUMP.

122
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,919
SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL

123
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,021
BE HEARING NOW VERY SOON.

124
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,889
THIS TWEET FROM THE

125
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,291
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF LAST HOUR ON

126
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:39,624
SCREEN.

127
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:41,860
IS THIS PHONY WITCH HUNT GOING

128
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,397
TO GO ON EVEN LONGER SO IT

129
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:46,331
WRONGFULLY IMPACTS THE MID-TERM

130
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,134
ELECTIONS WHICH IS WHAT THE

131
00:03:49,134 --> 00:03:49,835
DEMOCRATS ALWAYS INTENDED?

132
00:03:49,835 --> 00:03:50,769
REPUBLICANS BETTER GET TOUGH

133
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:52,170
AND SMART BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

134
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,006
WHAT ABOUT THE LAST PART OF

135
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:55,307
THAT.

136
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:57,342
ARE REPUBLICANS TOUGH AND SMART

137
00:03:57,342 --> 00:03:58,276
AS HE SUGGESTS?

138
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:01,780
>> I THINK WE ARE DEFINITELY AS

139
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,982
A PARTY A VERY TOUGH PARTY AND

140
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:05,283
WE ARE CERTAINLY SMART.

141
00:04:05,283 --> 00:04:06,985
THE QUESTION IS ARE WE GOOD AT

142
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:07,352
MARKETING.

143
00:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,820
THAT QUESTION NEEDS TO BE

144
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,689
ANSWERED BY PROOFING TO THE

145
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:11,623
AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE

146
00:04:11,623 --> 00:04:15,827
SUCCESSES WE HAVE SEEN FROM A

147
00:04:15,827 --> 00:04:17,228
POLICY PERCENTECTIVE WE OUGHT

148
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:18,630
TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.

149
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,499
WE CAN'T ALLOW FAKE NEWS TO

150
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:21,433
CREATE THIS BARRAGE THAT

151
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:23,068
REQUIRES US TO RESPOND TO EVERY

152
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:24,703
SINGLE THING THAT COMES OUT OF

153
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,138
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA MACHINE.

154
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:28,039
WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING ON THE

155
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,674
FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME

156
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:31,543
SINCE 2000 WE HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT

157
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:32,244
RATES UNDER 4%.

158
00:04:32,244 --> 00:04:34,613
THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

159
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:36,248
RECORDED HISTORY THAT

160
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:36,982
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT

161
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,350
IS AT 6.6%.

162
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,152
WE'VE HAD THE LARGEST EXPANSION

163
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,620
IN OUR ECONOMY THAT WE CAN

164
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,722
REMEMBER IN THE LAST CENTURY.

165
00:04:43,722 --> 00:04:45,023
THE FACTS ARE VERY CLEAR.

166
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,225
IF WE DON'T MARKET TO THE

167
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,393
AMERICAN PEOPLE THE SUCCESS,

168
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,495
THE POLICY SUCCESS OF THIS

169
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,597
ADMINISTRATION, WE PUT IN PERIL

170
00:04:52,597 --> 00:04:54,232
AND JEOPARDIZE THE SUCCESS THAT

171
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:55,667
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED US TO

172
00:04:55,667 --> 00:04:58,770
HAVE IN NOVEMBER TO CONTINUE

173
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,306
THIS ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT

174
00:05:01,306 --> 00:05:02,941
REQUIRES GOOD, CONSERVATIVE

175
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,076
POLICIES TO UNDERGIRD THE NEXT

176
00:05:05,076 --> 00:05:07,179
WAVE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

177
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,080
AVERAGE PERSON WORKING PAYCHECK

178
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,514
TO PAYCHECK.

179
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:10,916
>> Bill: THERE WILL BE A LOT OF

180
00:05:10,916 --> 00:00:00,000
TALK OF THIS IN THE COMING
