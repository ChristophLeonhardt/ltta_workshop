you I'm Ezra Levant it's May 17th and you're watching battleground hey welcome back it's great to see you what we do every day at 12 noon Eastern Time is we have what's called a YouTube super chat it's live TV plus you can write comments to me alive on the side of your youtube screen sometimes we have hundreds of comments over the course of the hour if you want yours to stand out there's a function that YouTube's invented called super chat that's their phrase you chip in a couple bucks or I suppose as much as you want five bucks ten bucks the other day someone chipped in fifty and it puts your comment in a bright highlighted color and it appends it to the top of the comment box so I will not miss it it's fun and it's also a way to support our viewer supported TV show today we're doing something new in addition to the super chat function on YouTube we are also live-streaming on Facebook and pretty soon we'll add a live stream on Twitter periscope to so I think we're gonna triple the amount of folks who are watching the show in different mediums so I hope that works what we do it's a little less produced here then my evening show behind the paywall I have some video clips and some other websites that I've just found interesting maybe I tweeted them something like that and we show them and I read your comments I want to start with the news I think of the moments and it's just so ephemeral because there's one of these every single day it's just your daily fake news moment obviously it's about Donald Trump he is the target of the majority of the fake news in the world and this is just the it's perfect I mean it's it's not huge but sometimes the little things are telling it's only let me start by showing you a CNN video see the most trusted name in news that used to be their motto I don't think I don't even think even they have the hood spread to say that anymore you take a look at the CNN video we have people coming into the country of trying to come in we're stopping on a lot of them but we're taking people out of the country you wouldn't believe how bad these people are these aren't people these are animals and we're taking him out of the country at a level rape that's never happened before and because of the weak laws they come in fast we get them we release them we get them again we bring them out it's crazy the dumbest laws as I said before the dumbest laws on immigration in the world that was the clip that played on CNN you notice they didn't play the question beforehand and they played Donald Trump using very tough language including calling these immigrants animals and that took off like lightning Trump calls foreigners animals Trump calls immigrants animals Trump calls Mexicans animals I want to show you some of the celebrity tweets and then I'll show you what CNN did not sure but I'm some of these celebrity tweet I mean it's just everybody here's Andy Richter because of course I go to him for my deep thoughts on immigration yes he is a dehumanizing bigoted monster but also he has no idea what he's talking about him talking about laws is like a chimp talking about brain surgery please someone stop us so calling someone a dehumanizing bigoted monster chimp that's cool but calling someone animals isn't if you're condemning someone for being rude don't be rude just in that very second do we have any more of these celebrity reactions Kathy Griffin of course because if there's someone who's an arbiter of good taste its Kathy Griffin the woman who stood up with a fake severed head of Donald Trump how they f uck isn't this a breaking news story the president the United States calling immigrants animals he's acting like it's just the criminals but he really means all immigrants I'm effing disgusted Kathy Griffin is a very deep thinker and I found this very moving do we have any more celebrity tweets it's nothing the celebrities I mean Sophia Bush ice is deporting people who served multiple tours in the US military something officer bone spurs never did they're deporting people who love America more than Trump will ever pretend to are they animals Donny boy shame on him it's not just the airheads leverage do you have any more of those yeah these are animals that's Joss Whedon he's he's he's those are the celebrity reactions and celebrities by definition are not the most thoughtful people for a living they read lines that other people write for them if you were very negative and critical you could say that an actor sort of lies for a living not lies but pretends to be something he is not for a living so when an actor actually shows himself to be vacuous you can't be too mad because it's just an actor the job is to read lines convincingly that someone else wrote but the regular journalism actual journalists including in CNN who ran with that oh he called immigrants animals was ubiquitous including Associated Press which is I point out one of the companies chosen by Facebook to be their fact-checker they ran with it now let me show you what CNN did not show what the Hollywood lovey's did not mention and much more importantly what the so called thoughtful journalists everywhere from the New York Times to CNN to The Associated Press what they didn't show you let me show you the original video is part of a roundtable on California sanctuary cities as you know there's far left mayors and others who are declaring that they will not enforce the law against illegal immigrants including criminal illegal immigrants and of course one of the groups that has flooded into the United States and now actually coming up into Canada is a terrorists gang I'm gonna call it a terrorist group I don't think it's listed as a terrorist group but their tactics are Isis in style cutting off heads cutting people into parts in fact in some ways they're more shocking than Isis they specialize in the full face tattoos it's called ms-13 they're practically destroyed the Central American country of El Salvador the coming into the States are actually coming in the Canon now that was the question here take a look at what all those lovey's to use the British phrase did not know or willfully were blind to Donald Trump's comments take a look I know about I cannot tell ice about we have people coming into the country of trying to come in we're stopping okay I stopped it there because it's just a retail but you see my point that was a Fresno sheriff Margaret Mims and did you hear her she specifically asked about ms-13 that was the question and Trump gave a specific answer to ms-13 don't you think that's rather important don't you think that's rather the whole point of this I think that shows you the fake news media and their deception all right let me remind you what we're doing cuz more folks are piling in it's 1207 every day between 12:00 and 1:00 I have a super chat that's what it's called you can make your comments on the right side of the page I try and read them but there's so many of them if I were to read all of them it would take up the whole time I play clips I take some comments if you want your comments and highlight chip in a few bucks we need the dough that's one of the race ways we make money here the rebel we do not take 1.5 billion dollars a year like the CBC and like so many private media would love to do let me take a few questions there's no super track questions but I'll just sort of scroll through and ruber Sachs says ms-13 is a terrorist group I would agree with you all in that they are terrifying and they terrorize people but traditionally we say terrorist groups have a political ideology they terrorize for a political purpose ms-13 just terrorizes for fun profit sheer evil and personal enrichment and you know drug gangs would say so I don't I don't think I think they're terrorists and their style they who knows they may be allied with terrorist groups but I would call them the most violent criminal gang out there but yeah I mean I understand your point someone with the gentle name screw-off says yeah no one cares what Kathy thinks Kathy Griffin well um I disagree with you she seems to have sold out shows and she's still the toast of the left wing talk show circuit Sarah am Kathy Griffin is less of a comedian and more of a profit yeah I'm gonna disagree with you on that I think she just sort of takes the Democrat talking and sort of microwaves them and turns them even weirder and mutates them and then just says the most extreme thing possible just to try and get some attention I understand that that's the currency in Hollywood and she's on the wrong side of 50 in an industry the values youth and beauty and she's not that funny anymore like so many comedians she's replaced sour politics for what used to be funny humor that happened to be about politicians now it's just angry Democrat talking points maybe with a laugh track thrown in so yeah when when you're where Kathy Griffin is and you're sort of in the twilight of your career you do what you have to do to get attention in that town space girl says Minnesota checking in hello their entry required says hello from Sweden well hello there the weapon collection YouTube is trying to hide your content as we yes we're aware of that we're taking some steps up being in some email correspondence even this morning with one of our YouTube reps they don't care I mean the other day Paul Joseph Watson I think I mentioned this he did a video on that new childish gambino vid which is the most brutal violent snuff style video that's out there on YouTube no age restrictions shows depicts murders he had a few clips of that and he had political commentary his commentary video was age inappropriate you had to specifically opt-in to view it it was deemed controversial you couldn't like it you couldn't forward it you couldn't comment on it because it was too toxic but of course the original video itself was there 220 million times on YouTube no age restrictions at all pastor Phil Biggs chips into bugs thanks very much let's see that's what that's what the super chat looks like it puts it in bright colors I think if you chip in five bucks it actually appends your comment to the top of that box we're talking on YouTube super chat but we are streaming this as well on Facebook live okay why don't move to the next story it's from the capital city of British Columbia Canada and you know it's called Victoria that's the name of the city and it's very Victorian it's it's named after that's that monarch and it's a little it's a little bit British and it's character a little bit laid back they used to have a disparaging phrase for it newlyweds nearly Dead's it's so beautiful up there lots of retirees but also it's just very very pretty I like I like Victoria I it's the Empress Hotel it's beautiful future gardens they're a little bit eco they're a little bit freaky on the social justice where you saw I check out this weird weird statement by them by the mayor Victoria issues Ramadan challenge and I think we actually have a quote here yeah Victoria Mayor Lisa helps and her council so the whole teams get involved in this are challenging residents to take part in a community-wide fast on May 25th to mark Ramadan the holiest month in the Islamic calendar really take that quote down let's let's take a look at at least it helps just one more time the mayor very controversial wacky social justice warrior mayor and that's an imam at the local mosque since when does the secular government of a capital city no less and her council invoke demand request plead cajole suggests that the population of a city practice a particular religion which has a very specific religious meaning it's it's based on the Koran it's based on the belief in Muhammad and Allah what would they would they tell every person in the city no matter what religion to practice the Catholic ritual of lenss would they would they tell every Victorian to fast for a day on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur no of course not listen I I understand the separation of church and state although if you read the Canadian Constitution you'll find out there is no separation of church and state that's actually more of an American concept our church is actually hardwired right into our Constitution there are very special Christian rights in the Constitution that was part of the grand bargain between English and French Canada centuries ago but what about the separation of in state and don't you think that's socialist social justice warrior lease helps put a picture up just one more time I mean don't you think and she's got those problem glasses you know similar to the glasses that Kathleen Wynn wears you got that hairstyle you got those problem glasses that is a dour dour woman who never laughs scolds you for everything looks for microaggressions is always triggered do you think for a second she would promote Christianity let alone Baptist or evangelical or Pentecostal or Mormonism like a true true Christianity I affirm Christianity do you think she would ever promote that and instruct her residents including those of the Islamic persuasion to follow Christian rituals of course not why is she using the instrumentality of the state the resources of the state and her office to promote Sharia well because it's Canada 2018 if you dare criticize you're just an Islamophobic bigot so shut up let's take a peek are there any comments hate love says shut up Canadian well yeah that that's that's sort of the motto of the Canadian left and my motto is coming at me Justin Trudeau Queen's channel says what country was it where they buried the Muslim terrorists with pigs in well that is a very good question it is historically accurate that there was a an Islamic rebellion in the Philippines when there were American troops said this was out of more than a hundred years ago and the American tree you can could look this up because I just don't have it at my fingertips because I wasn't expecting the question the American soldier in charge of putting down this Islamic rebellion made a point about pigs pig fat on the bullets bury the bodies in pigs and according to the historical record when that came out that helped put down the rebellion because these Islamic extremists did not want to be buried in pigs fat I'm just telling you a historical example that's just history John Zealand's duper mayor should have out sandwiches to the starving well listen I think that if you're going to get into the Jimmy I think a mayor is not in the charity business a mayor is not in the religious business a mayor's business is running the city corporation with the powers that it is granted under our Constitution and whatever the municipality Act is I actually don't think the job of a mayor is to go hand out food to the homeless we have charities for that we have homeless shelters for that the mayor's job is to be the mayor but you're right it sounds like she has a little bit too much time on her hands Tom young John has a super chat tweet Jordyn Peterson's hour-long presentation the death of the oceans he claims bringing them back would be easy google it watch it Tom I think he might have made this comment to me before someone else did and I'm glad you're so passionate about that subject the death of the oceans and I do follow Jordan Peterson quite closely I know he tweets about it he's so prolific I just can't keep up if I were to watch every single Jordan Peterson videos I would have no time to do with anything myself I don't even know how he has time to create it I really don't know anyone in the world who is more prolific than he is and to that I say thank god he's amazing at Tommy young John with another comment what are your thoughts on confiscating fishing boats across GPS barbed wire and fish how do you feel about garbage in the oceans well Tom I was asked this question the other day and I answer was uninformed because I'm certainly don't want to pretend to have thought about this issue a lot I'm from a landlocked province originally called Alberta and but I think you're right I think the real way to save nature is to harness mankind's natural greed and by Green I mean we protect our private property more than we protect public property an example I always give is if there's a piece of garbage that someone throws in your backyard you grumble about it but you pick it up because it's your backyard you own it you have a property right in it pieces of garbage along the highway we don't care it's a tragedy of the Commons is how it was first described it's another example I like to give us that no one no one takes a car that they're renting No takes a rental car to the carwash because it's not your property why do you care where is it fits your property you put some love and care in it so it's why people often care for a home they own more than something they rent if we understand the the human nature behind that that yet greed is a negative way of saying it but it's self-interest that's that more neutral way of saying it then you'll understand why we care for things that we own and it's just not possible to care about everything that we don't if we could apply some sort of property rights to the oceans that's a libertarian idea I don't know if it's technically possible but the solution probably lies somewhere along there let's take a look at the clock I talk too much to 12-18 a third of our time is gone hey some folks who are watching now we're probably watching yesterday and I played for you a clip of Sophie Gregoire Trudeau that's Justin Trudeau's gold-digging wife and I call her a gold digger not because I have anything personal against her but rather that's how she is in terms of entitlement to the public person of course she insisted on not one but two nannies put on the public payroll I don't know if ever before in the history of Canada or even the United States or any liberal democracy that's not a kleptocracy I've never heard of the first lady putting nannies on the payroll like if there's some you know event planner or chief of staff fine but you you're putting your own nannies on the taxpayer pay we're not one but two like she's some Angelina Jolie celebrity or something and and of course as you know it was Sophie Gregoire Trudeau who not once but twice called up that billionaire Island in the Bahamas and say hey can I bring my friends over and the princess who owned the island said well we're not going to be there and Sofia Gregoire Trudeau said oh no that's that's fine I don't want to see you I just want your free stuff she's such a gold digger yesterday I played for you a clip of her being inflicted on a on a Martin Luther King jr. Day event in Ottawa I'm not sure why we have Martin Luther King Day in Ottawa I mean I actually admire Martin Luther King quite a bit but he was an American who fought the civil rights battle in America our Canadian story is very different as you may know we were the destination of the Underground Railroad we were where freed slaves fled - so I really don't know why there was a Martin Luther King event in in Ottawa it's fine I'm not against it it's just you know don't really you know Rosa Parks wasn't our story either this just on her story but so free grégoire Trudeau was inflicted on them and she insisted on singing and I played you a little bit of her song yesterday but when it happened Gavin McInnes our alumnus he's sang along with it and as I mentioned yesterday we've we've produced about eighty two hundred videos here at the rebel in our three years of existence and I have to say of the eight thousand two hundred videos we've produced this is the funniest it is the funniest so it's it's 12:20 will you permit me to play like like two minutes of of Gavin McInnes singing along with Sophie Gregoire through there and if you were in the crowd that day that's really the only thing you could do because you're not going to clap because it's that bad and you're not gonna walk out because that would be you know you don't need to humiliate the woman any more than she's humiliating herself I think what she probably wanted you to do is to sing along with her so without further ado here's my friend Gavin McInnes in a beautiful accidental duet with Canada's beautiful beautiful talented first lady roll it when you smile back on me when you smile back with me i sugar sack in the corner of your eyes oh it's a nice on you do we will say goodbye but nothing will take away what's between you and me oh my god is that guys sleep or blind when you saw me when you smile when you smile check this out what she Eva Peron is this Evita you know what we we joined Gavin halfway through that you got to watch the whole thing you gotta watch so you just just find it on our YouTube channels I thought that was pretty funny um all right I I want to read a couple more comments check the time I was gotta check the time because you know we finish at 1 p.m. Eastern uh Spencer Jake's an atheist idols laugh out loud yeah that that was that was pretty rough screw off says I wish Gavin could have stayed with you guys yeah I mean I love Gavin - I mean you know the story if he left he was hired by CR TV they offered him so much money we just couldn't compete we're grassroots see our TV is owned by a billionaire out of Vegas who I mean he earned his money did very well he's outstanding and he invested it in CR TV and you got to thank him for that so I there's just no way we could compete but I actually keep in touch with Gavin fairly often he's too funny the guys just he's is I think it's the funniest guy I've met he he has no filter and he just says anything at any moment and if you have any sensitivities or tender spots he'll find them in about 60 seconds and he'll poke them for the audience Justin Trudeau Quinn's channel again says Justin did a duet with her I've got it on my channe same tune I don't believe you I don't Justin Trudeau did it duet with her I don't believe you but you've made me think of something and let me ask our production team if they can find it can you find me the Justin Trudeau Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is younger man she clipped from two Lamond on pile and this is not a duet my friends but this is Justin and Sophie and a fellow named Jian Ghomeshi and Canadians will know him he was the celebrity radio host on the state broadcaster very sensitive man Women's Studies major perfectly multicultural Persian from London England he's perfect and then turned out he was a bit of a Harvey Weinstein and just punched women for sexual pleasure but I was reading a clip about Sophie and and Justin in a minute how are ya ears bleeding dogs howling don't be mean okay give me a little bit means entry required it is hard to laugh when we still staggering from eight years of the Obama administration yeah you know what I think that Sophie Trudeau sort of thinks she's like Michelle Obama but I don't know if Michelle Obama ever inflicted her singing on a crowd like that Kevin JT wants to kiss men well that's a very prescient comment I'll show you that too the one dog parle video in the second when we find him I'll just read one more Susan s says someone put that animal out of her misery well now don't be mean don't be mean she was just expressing herself can you imagine I mean I'm very very critical of Justin Trudeau I'm very critical Trudeau but can you take one moment of pity and imagine how many times Justin Trudeau had to listen to her sing that song around the house just hum it sing it as she's wandering around or if she would have a command performance as in she commands her family to listen you found that song tough to listen to once or twice imagine how many times Justin Trudeau was forced to listen to that and where is he gonna run you can't run outside and go down the street he can't just say honey I'm going to bowling with the guys because he's got a role with a whole RCMP entourage right like our Secret Service so I don't have a lot of sympathy for Justin Trudeau in any domain but do you doubt he has been forced to listen to that song 50 times 50 times have some pity for the man entry required Esther what about Hamilton Canada declaring the anarchist symbol hate speech alright I mean I've seen the headline haven't read the details but I think I have enough to go on the anarchist symbol is hate speech by that I mean it is speech motivated by a strong emotion anarchy by definition is against things it's against any rule it is and quite often the emotions that animated our hate to which I say so what I hate the natural human emotion you can no more eradicate it than you can eradicate the human emotion of love we all feel love hate contempt respects every day for things I hate the Toronto Raptors I love the Toronto Raptors I hate the Liberals I love the Liberals these are words we say oh I hate that sandwich oh I love that dress oh I hate that guy oh I hate my I mean we love and we hate things all the time we have different degrees of hate but hate as a human emotion is not illegal it cannot be illegal and if you have any doubt may I advise you to check section section 2a of the Canadian Constitution which protects thought belief opinion etc or the First Amendment the United States you're allowed to hate things the only limit is on transforming the emotion of hate into some sort of criminal action like a punch but the problem with a punch is not that it's motivated by a certain emotion in your mind it's that you punch someone your fielder you're free to have the most hati emotions you like in fact quite often that emotion if you harness it and transmogrify it and sublimate it can be an engine for positive change we were talking about Martin Luther King I am sure if you did a word search through his speeches Martin Luther King talks about the things that he hates he hated racism he hated segregation he hated people being treated less than a full citizen but he unlike Martin Malcolm X who became negative and called for violence Malcolm Martin Luther King jr. sublimated those negative feelings into a positive movement you cannot ban something simply because emotion behind it is hateful so in conclusion I would say yes the anarchist symbol is hateful and the second and more important point is so what you don't ban a symbol a sir addiction you can't ban a symbol a symbol itself is no crime or not not to be it's it's the actions that may or may not be criminal thanks for letting me answer that question in some length it's 1228 we're halfway done I have a lot more quote I have a lot more stuff I want to show you and if you think Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is cool if you think she's totally hip totally connected with the Millennials well she's got a competition in Justin Trudeau's circles because there is a cabinet minister who is even cooler than Sophie Gregoire Trudeau and her name is Catherine McKenna she is a hero and I don't throw that word around lightly she's a hero take it from me and don't take it from the Liberal Party take it from the nonpartisan civil service at Environment Canada these are the professional bureaucrats the politicians come and go but these are the professionals they take a civil service oath of non-partisanship and loyalty to the government of the day they're what makes this country work and so not from her political account but rather from the government account of environment of Canada this important piece of business was done yesterday put it up on the screen please as you can see it's the verified account for Environment Canada Minister McKenna is also a climate hero and she is a great example of high-level women influencers who will be leading discussions at tomorrow's climate leaders summit women kinky yet on climate in Canada she's not just a hero she's totally kicking it um and you know she talks a little bit like this and valley girl it's not a speech impediment she's just a high-level woman and if you doubt she's a high-level woman you're in an Islamophobe and not just that you're sexist misogynist and this is not me saying it these are the non nonpartisan experts at Environment Canada who are totally nonpartisan kicking it she's kicking it is that what the kids say I don't know let's go to the role model for super cool kids what would her fellow kids say it's personal we got a little video there how do you do fellow kids what he's totally kicking it me what was it shirt play that clip again I want to see what's on his shirt there how do you do fellow kids what yeah yeah how do you do fellow kids rock band can you put Catherine McKenna tweet up there again which is cooler rock band how are you fellow kids or Minister McKenna is a climbing hero and she's also a great example of high-level woman and she's kicking it I'm totally kicking it and I'm a high level woman that that's embarrassing with it what do you think is that more embarrassing Ben Sophie Gregoire Trudeau at least sofa Gregoire Trudeau well this she's putting her heart out there on the stage at least she was expressing her artistic nature and yeah everybody laughed at her but that's fine she was owning that moment imagine being the chief of staff in Catherine McKenna's office and or during Environment Canada - basically it's like sending yourself flowers on Valentine's Day that's how pitiful it is when you order nonpartisan civil servants to say you're a hero Sophie Gregoire Trudeau is really really cringey and I think she lacks self knowledge about how she looks I think she's a little bit cuckoo and I think she's one reason that Justin Trudeau is actually quite unhappy and goes on so damn many trips he's on his what 56 trip just to get out of the country get away from the missus sometimes he takes her on trips too but look that's her what's Catherine McKenna's excuse for ordering nonpartisan civil servants to praise her let's take some questions Andrew heathering totes kicking it absolutely Bernard Hutchinson says climate Barbie needs to do it do it with climate cringe oh you're right Robert Jackson so glad I'm not a simple actor and don't know what that means Andrew Hetherington my ten-year-old would be embarrassed if I said something like that yeah I think you um Gary selling says climate barbie is a pseudo-intellectual and as smart as a bag of doorknobs what she we played a video for about her the other day on the show being asked about the economic impacts of carbon tax or other images had no clue she just repeats the same banal lines I'm a climate hero um Miss Mary anywhere says McKenna is also a human rights lawyer well what does that mean human rights lawyer I don't know any human rights she's fought for she doesn't fight for freedom of speech doesn't fight for freedom of religion separation of mosque and state I haven't seen her fight for any human rights lately of you someone here says Andrea says that argue the connection is terrible Ezreal okay good I take your word for it I know if that's on our end or on yours if so I'm sorry okay it's 1233 and I want to make sure I get through some of the stuff I've got here on my list I I mentioned from time to time that I have a show at 8 p.m. and do we have a clip from my show last night yeah we do okay so I do the show this week all this battleground it's just a kibbutz as you can see I'm not scripted I'm just going from your comments I got a few notes here with some video clips we have and stuff but one let you know that every day at 8 p.m. I have a show behind a paywall it's 8 bucks a month you get my show every day you get Sheila gun Reid show David Menzies got a bunch of American content to John Carr deal out of Florida and so I thought you know what why don't I play you like a couple minutes every day on battleground that's this show a couple of minutes excerpt from last night's paywall stroke just so you know what I'm talking about because every day I say oh yeah see it tonight at 8:00 p.m. but you don't know what I'm talking about so without further ado let me show you it but it's about a two-minute excerpt from from my show last night it's a story that really no TV station in Canada had shown we showed we're not really a TV station we're an Internet station but other than other than the New Brunswick the Frederickson Daily Gleaner no one had talked about this until we did less than take a look today's news item New Brunswick is worse it's a mother and a father Syrian migrants who repeatedly threatened to murder their own daughter for various honor crimes now let me quote a bit from the story a Syrian refugee couple upon learning their adult daughter was dating a non-muslim man in Fredericton threatened her with an honor killing court heard Tuesday oh just that so they'll come to Canada to take our free stuff our free health care are free welfare subsidized housing halal food banks plain old cash but their daughter socializing with a Canadian that's Haram that's for burden it's dirty it's dishonorable they would murder their own daughter for disgracing them for fraternizing with Canadians yea Canadians sorry why did he come to Canada if you hate Canadian people so much I'll read some more from the story crown prosecutor prosecutor Claude hashe said by n Ayub reported to Fredericton police force in mid-february that her father Ahmad Ayub threatened to kill her on three occasions so buying is the daughter you see there both mom and dad threatened to murder her again and again the first time was in April 2016 just two months after the family arrived in Canada court heard when the father became irate when he discovered by and had an iPad she'd won in the contest he threatened to poison her food at that time as Shaye said poison Hey that's dad of the year material right there that's that's a Trudeau refugee that's unvetted mass migration from a rape culture that treats women is chattel that's violence that's anti infidel bigotry we hear the word Islamophobia a lot but what do you call it when a Syrian migrant hates Canadians so much that he tells his own daughter he'll poison her if she hangs out with Canadians even chats with him on an iPad no what's that Canada phobia or something how about just someone who doesn't belong here and doesn't deserve our charity maybe he's better fit for Syria after all they do a lot of that over there but but it wasn't just a heated comment in the moment it's something he said again and again that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the yeas relevant we could take it we could take this part down here that's great so that's a that's a short excerpt every day I do a monologue out on 10-15 minutes kind of thing lots of quotes or facts or clips in that case it was from The Daily Gleaner then I do two interviews so if that's the kind of thing you want I've encouraged you to sign up you know just get my sure you get Sheila's and John Carr Dilys and David Menzies by the way during during that I was looking at some of the comments I understand that we have some buffering issues today I'm aware of that it may be related to the fact that we've got sort of double pipes got a pipe going to Facebook and a pipe going to youtube and pipe is that is that a technical top am i totally kicking it by using the technical comment as a climate hero am i kicking it fellow youth mm-hmm when I say pipes that just shows how how with it I am um let me check the time is 12 38 were two-thirds done I want to run an ad I want to run an ad for rebel Israel this is basically your last chance to come with Sheila

with about 60 or 70 of your fellow rebels plus the five rebel celebrities hey if she can call yourself a climate hero I can say our people are celebrities right so show the ad sure the ads show people what I'm talking about it's a great little ad and you know what that makes me really excited about the trip I was singing ten days it's a long time away but first of all I remember how great the food is and and I mean I know it sounds funny but Israel it really is a foodie kind of place I mean it's the crossroads of three continents Asia Africa Europe and you got all kinds of folks here you got your Ashkenazi Jews European tradition you got your Arab Jews called safar damn you've gone Ethiopian Jews you got and there's such as Jews you've got a million Muslims there you've got million Russians who've come over the last 20 years it's a it's a hell of a place and of course we're going with smart tour guides bit of a political I don't know if I've mentioned this but we've actually got tickets to the Israel Air Force Academy's graduation Air Show that's a pretty hot ticket I'm excited about that oh I see there's a super Chad comment from CC MMA ACC 123 35 bucks thank you very much says hi Ezra proud producers Club member here this is the first time I've been able to participate live I love the format of this live show your thoughts on Kinder Morgan will they state well thanks very much for your generous which a comment I did not think Kinder Morgan will stain I think they are not interested in drama and all we're getting from our drama teacher prime minister is drama and all we're getting from Bill Morneau is vague passive-aggressive comments Kinder Morgan does not want to bail out they do not want a government investment partner would you want government investing in your project they just want to be able to build the pipeline with their own looking for an investor they're not looking for an insurer and Bill Morneau yesterday was starting to Telegraph that he's going to blame Kinder Morgan for driving a hard bargain they don't want a bargain they just want the laws of Canada to be implemented I am quite sure they're going to go because I do not think first of all the Justin Trudeau Bill Morneau Catherine McKenna and Jim Carr are serious about keeping them they haven't lifted a finger to pave the way in BC Trudeau and geryl butts their whole base is environmentalists in BC they're not going to call off their dogs I'm just worried that this is not just going to be a loss of a seven point four billion dollar construction project and all the oil and gas industries that are depending on the pipeline but it's going to basically be the final word on should you invest money in a big industrial project in Canada and they killed Northern Gateway they killed energy East they're killing Kinder Morgan they've driven out Pacific Northwest LNG about a hundred billion dollars all told between him and Rachel Notley so such as the loss of Kinder Morgan who on earth would invest here and I point out again the total sa the large French oil and gas company they pulled out of Alberta and invested in Iran they actually think that's a better risk adjusted rate of return so thanks for that superjet comments let me check the time it's twelve forty three I got to be careful I only have 17 minutes left and I have a couple more video clips yesterday I mentioned Rob Ford and how he had a natural disdain for the media I mentioned his brother Doug Ford who sort of one standard deviation more normal than Rob godbless Doug and may he rest in peace Rob God bless Rob and may he rest in peace I loved him and I loved him for his flaws because he was so very human and I think everyone thought he's human he's frail he's made a lot of mistakes but the way he is being crucified is where I think the bullying of Rob Ford by the sneering snob media was half of his appeal because everyone projected and said they must feel the same way about me I mean the mockery in The Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star about him being fat well I mean I'm fat - I'm not quite as fat as Rob Ford was so the way they sneered at Rob for being fat you don't think they think that way about you - the way they sneered at him for his foibles you don't think they feel that way about you - and so I think the it was like a diamond the more pressure was put on him the the stronger he became in terms of his appeal for the public Rob is gone doug is here doug is not as edgy as Robbie doesn't have the same challenges that we know of he's not as ideological strong either I'm told that Rob used to call Doug the pinko in the family I don't know if that's true that's gossip but what I loved best about Rob Ford is he did not give the media any more respect than they deserve and they deserve very little and I mentioned to me probably the greatest media relations example I have ever seen in my life you know Donald Trump had a better one when he was challenged on the word pocahontas in North Dakota we'll have to play that clip tomorrow Hannah remind me to get that Pocahontas clip from Trump but other than that what I'm about to show you is perhaps the finest example of how to handle a journalist I have ever seen so this is audio this is from a radio show on canada's state broadcaster called the cbc the interviewer is a Marxist that's what she is then Carole off and this was right after Rob Ford won the mayor's race in Toronto and the CBC was his greatest antagonist he had enough respect that he agreed to the interview but not much more plate now I'm not sure what image were going to show this is just from YouTube it's the audio so there may be some stock images that whoever uploaded this through on their so it's not the that's not the video that's important it's not the visuals that important it's the sound what you're about to hear now is an actual radio interview done by the state broadcaster - Rob Ford god blessed his soul take a listen people are saying that's calling it a stunning win what do you think things are going really well what drew so much dr. Junior's aren't even hearing all right all right Ella mr. Ford are you there yeah yeah I'm here yeah oh you're at some event or I'm a coach I'm Coco ch okay so you're at football practice then yeah all right well okay we'll continue that what is it do you think juice so much support to your campaign now it's just the people are sick and tired of the wasteful spending people are sick and tired of waste spending that's the bottom line the circumstance in let me know I'm the only one that could go down there you just go get chicken go and get change don't worry about the water right now sorry it went on how perfect is that go out and get changed don't worry about the water right now go ahead and get changed he was coaching high school football volunteer of course and and this big fancy pants muckety-muck probably makes half a million bucks a year state broadcaster socialists cbc radio their flagship show calls him up yeah he'll he'll show him enough real he'll take a call that's the great thing but Rob before he'll take a call from anyone and I think his brothers the same way you used to call Rob Ford about a pothole he'd call you back he'd call you back I know it like that he called me back once so he'll take a call from the socialist but he's not gonna stop coaching these high school kids who's more important these high school kids that actually need a coach or some loser at the CBC some hack who hates him that was I mean you could find that pretty quick on youtube if you want the whole thing we only played about 30 seconds there but he did not stop coaching and and you know I bet you know I bet a lot of coaches volunteer coaches they got a call from their wife or something their kid their buddy while they're coaching they don't say okay team you all sit there and do nothing while I talk to this buddy am i know you're coaching while you're on the phone that's a normal human being that was my favorite media moment of all time other than the Pocahontas clip which I'll try and show you tomorrow so yeah I just wanted to mention that because I sometimes we don't have our clips as fast but who knows and if you can find the Pocahontas clip we'll show it today but if not I'll find it now show you one tomorrow let's check the time and take some comments as 1248 what we're doing every day we call a battleground i kibbutz I randomly chat about things I have a list of clips and other websites that I try and go through show you some things from other parts of our show take comments I mean super chat is a phrase that Google uses for comments that are put on bright colors as you can see CMAC 1 2 3 was generous UPS shipping 35 bucks that's why he's comment as pin to the top here's Craig McDonald for $13.99 thank you very much I'd rather get my donations to the rebel then to the UCP or the CPC since they refuse to treat the rebels legitimate media don't they know were the we're their only friends in the media that's Craig McDonald well you're right and I wouldn't even say where their friends were the only people giving them a fair shot we criticize someone who's appropriate but we don't criticize them in a malicious bad faith gotcha kind of way which the CBC and the mainstream media do and I continue to believe that it's important for the conservative parties in Canada to have media to their right to pull them to the right when everyone else pulls them to the left if Jason Kenney Andrew Shearer were the most right-wing things in the country every single gravitational force would pull them to the left no one would pull them to the right surely you want as many to your right as to your left so you can walk straight you can walk a straight line to marginalize so something right let me ask you this have you ever seen the Liberal Party marginalized a medium to their left no they let it give us them cover I mean how many times have you heard a politician say I must be doing something right I got folks am i right am i left criticising I'm on the right path I that's that's not a logical argument but it has a certain effectiveness to say I'm actually moderate Doug Ford knew that when Tania grana Kalyn ran in the leadership and then supported him she was to his right so he looked moderate when he threw her overboard why would you throw overboard your insulation your protection so thanks for chipping in to us and by the way you never need to give money to these political parties you know how much money the federal Conservatives got last year I think they raised about 18 million or 20 million bucks they get such and that's on top of the government subsidies they get and that's on top of the government budgets they have the Conservative Party of Canada and the caucus and the MPs and their leaders the opposition they're probably burning up 50 million bucks a year from taxpayers so yeah if you're going to give them a hundred bucks they'll send you a little thank-you note and you'll never get off their email and phone list but they don't even extra hundred bucks whereas we don't get a dime from the government I wouldn't want a dime from the government we turn into Carol off but yeah thank you for that I truly believe that if the dollar for dollar bang for your buck don't give money to the Conservative Party and I'm not not against the served a party I'm saying a hundred bucks to them is nothing okay let's check the time it's twelve fifty one we only have nine minutes left let's read some more quotes screw Rob says Ezra I really like the format I wish YouTube would let you flourish instead of doing their best to inhibit you yeah thanks very much I agree with you I think we have some buffering issues that may be on our end today we're gonna look into that but yeah they're definitely screwing with our notifications and D monetization say massively demonetised us about 16 months ago but we live on hmm John says Rob could have cared less about the fake news media my hero you're exactly right and it was very it was very telling that all the people who talk about don't bully and mental health awareness and be kind be better when it was Rob Ford they brought out the daggers and the guy clearly had personal challenges they didn't care they went in for the kill they were literally paying the Toronto Star was deliberately repaying a bounty $5,000 for anyone in Rob Ford's friends or acquaintances to tape him on cell phones surreptitiously at home in private residences off-duty just to get embarrassing stuff oh he's drunk haha here's $5,000 they literally put a bounty on anything embarrassing these are the folks who had a front page story because during his diet he went into a KFC sorry is that news that is not news that's fat shaming and now fat shaming and other kinds of shaming and in splaining is a social justice warriors bane unless it's Rob Ford then fire away we've one more question then we got a couple more videos I'm going to try and jam in its 1253 black pigeon speaks has a great video on the two london's that's what's fast times over thirty nine cents okay lauren southern the masculine version of Lauren says CBC fake news are they totally fake news entry required such as the oil prices are low how viable is oil sands development now I thought I remembered $90 a barrel was a break-even point for oil cents well first is first of all oil prices are not low I haven't checked them lately but they're in the eighty to ninety dollar range right now that's US dollars so convert that to Canadian that's over a hundred bucks the trouble is number one we can't get worl prices for our oil because there's the bottleneck at the pipeline's so we're selling at a tremendous discount if you're interested Google West Texas Intermediate w2i WTI or North Sea Brent these are various classifications or types of oil in the world market look at the prices for what for West Texas Intermediate I don't know I haven't checked it I mean I guess eighty eighty five bucks compare that to what's called Western Canada select that's another way of saying oil sands oil Western Canada selects probably twenty bucks a barrel cheaper us because we are forced to sell it at a discount because we only have pipelines to one customer and there's a glut of oil and a shortage of pipelines so that's one problem there are oil sands producers that can make money in the thirty dollar range but that's not going to work if you're being carbon taxed and production capped and income taxed and regulated to death yeah so that's the problem if you look there are high-cost jurisdictions around the world that are booming it's Canada that's not and it's because of our own policies 12:54 we have time for one more video I want to play this save the Christians video because we we played that before but now I'm pleased to say you can have a video on-demand download right now for our first documentary called save the Christians here's a little explanation of what that's all about women don't even know a little motion Sara - Sara therapist overhead Raja Raja McGee done on the planet Donita I knew Galilee moon shuttle Islam mission bubble hey welcome back I was just looking at comments while Matt I was running if you haven't seen save the Christians yet I encourage you to do so it's about the genocide there's no other word for it ethnic cleansing is maybe another word of Christians in Arab and Muslim lands we visited Iraq we saw Christian communities that are 1,400 years old and they're being wiped out by Isis it's no 56 I'm pleased to say our hard-working production team has found that clip I was talking about perhaps the only better media relations moment than Rob Ford doing a radio interview while barking out coaching orders to the kids was Donald Trump I think you said North Dakota which is right near the Canadian border there's actually a Canadian activist journalist in the crowd and just as I'm sending up here a little bit for the clip Elizabeth Warren as you know the Democrat senator from Massachusetts I think who faked her Aboriginal identity she said she was Indian so she could get an affirmative action hire at Harvard she was not qualified to be hired but she said oh yeah I'm Indian I'm Indian sort of like Rachel Dolezal or Shaun King white kids pretending to be black so they could you know can't work and stuff so this woman not only lied and cheated and fraudulently got that position but she denied an actual Aboriginal that position I mean if the idea is to promote Aboriginal people she stole that from them so this has all come out as being proved many times she's a liar and so weird as she's digging in online but Donald Trump calls her Pocahontas because that's what he does he's just got the funny nicknames and it's hilarious and he said him and some journalist said that's a phone serve those offensive and Donald Trump gave a master class of how to deal with a whiny leftist journalist who says you're saying who scold you for using words like locker Rob and I think my team here has the video so let's play the Pocahontas clip job Pocahontas Pocahontas look look she is alright oh I'm sorry about that Pocahontas so what you said Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren she is no no she tweets a lot about me every once in a while I'll tweet and when I tweet you know not that many people are watching her twitch when I tweet they watch I will say this look she is a senator that's highly overrated she's yeah he goes on for a bit but did you catch the the key part that was a journalist who said that's hardly a phone wolf I'm deeply offended and he said what a poker Honus you spent about Pocahontas you saying I shouldn't say Pocahontas Pocahontas Pocahontas you mad that I said Pocahontas okay I better not say Pocahontas and then he did not bend the knee he owned it and what's she gonna keep saying oh you you bring even more offensive well yeah we know that you would say that because you've already said that and the worst you can do is keep on saying that and we're just gonna all laugh at you because you're a scold but had he said what any other politician would do normally which is oh I'm so sorry well then that would have been a story and he would have bent the knee and then people can know that they could silence Donald Trump the reason he's so popular so you can't there's one last super chat tweet I'll mention and then we're out of time ally Clark thank you very much you're a regular super chatter excellent documentary Ezra watched yesterday whether it be updates regarding this region also is donations campaign ongoing thank you very much for
