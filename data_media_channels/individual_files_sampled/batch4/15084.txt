so I am crossing out all of my predictions from last week for the council elections because clearly I'm stupid so I said in about a week or so ago that Labor's gonna sweep it no problem it's all gonna be labeled labor labor that's what's going to be interesting about the night and actually it might not be this is really interesting so one thing that I think will remain true is the article from the independent the story here is labor to sweep London in local elections with best result for any party since 1968 I think that's gonna remain true and I've talked about that before and it's you know mainly a demographic thing in London but there's an interesting story here from the standard jeremy corbyn's ratings dipped to lowest level since before general election that's interesting jeremy corbyn's ratings among the public and labor supporters have dropped to the lowest level since before last year's general election the finding by Ipsos MORI suggests a second honeymoon which has began with Labour's improved performance in the 2017 vote has come to an end labour and conservatives are virtually level pegging in the poll which has the party standing at Tories forty one percent down to labour forty down to Liberal Democrats ten plus four somehow who is it who folks Liberal Democrat you know I've been walking around that last weekend and I've seen lots of houses with Liberal Democrats signs at the front and I always wonder who are these people who is so excited by the Liberal Democrats that they put a Lib Dem sign in front of their house anyway the greens and UK are on 2% each some six in ten labour supporters are satisfied with the leader down from seven in ten and what's interesting as well is we see an impulse Mori Evening Standard poll here conservatives on 41 - to labour on 40 but this is what's most interesting is the satisfaction ratings so may 38 percent satisfied 55 percent dissatisfied not great but korban is 32 satisfied 6 less than May and 59 dissatisfied for more than May so that proves pretty interesting I mean of course I know we've got the fact that we've had the Windrush scandal I know we've just got a brand new Home Secretary and that's kind of shook things up a bit but clearly people are a bit more have a little bit more faith in Teresa may as a leader than they do Jeremy Corbyn and as this says it is true that politicians do get honeymoon phases and labor will benefit you know in in this general sorry in this local election because it's kind of a protest vote against the current government but these satisfaction ratings don't bode well for either of them and Teresa may is in a better position interestingly they've got Vince Cable on here might as well just throw him in the Vince cable of the Liberal Democrats only 28 percent satisfied 35 percent dissatisfied and I guess the the remainder of those percentage points have no idea who he is who is Vince Cable the government hears the levels of satisfaction for the government as well 30 percent satisfied 63 percent dissatisfied not great 30 percent satisfied I think Trump Trump's satisfaction figures are significantly higher than our government isn't that interesting he'll be over in a couple of months and we'll be protesting and moaning at him no doubt and he's going to go back to America thinking Britain hate him but hey what can you do so we are literally just a couple of days away from this election I love making predictions usually fairy right but this time I I think what I'm going to say in terms of my predictions is I think labour will still do well but the damage done to the Tories I think it'll be less than expected but I am still predicting a wipeout for you Kip and I think let's say the Liberal Democrats will gain tens of seats multiple tens have seized say 3040 seized that's why I'm sticking to I think that I think that's about right we'll see if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team remember to download our app on the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store and like and subscribe you
