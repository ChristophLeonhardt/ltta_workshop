Doug Ford was alleging there's a not-so-secret backroom deal with the Patrick Brown camp namely Patrick Brown supporters vote on mass to support Christine Elliot in return Patrick Brown gets the state keep a seat in the the PC party and Christine does a flip-flop and supports the carbon tax do you think there's any legitimacy to this claim well let's let there's a lot to unpack there I think that you can look at people like Alex Nidal who is an MP that I liked a lot and was very close with Patrick Brown he endorsed Christine Elliot's that couldn't be coincidence I know there have been other people that were on the Patrick brown campaign that didn't go to Christine but I think that that could have been a sign that there were certainly an exodus of people that maybe were influenced and asked to go to Christine Elliot's campaign it's possible I'm not I'm not saying that I don't think there was like a people forcing anyone to do it that's such a there might have been a backroom deal where everyone was forced to do something but we do know of some people like Alex notto who went over to the pastor the Christine Elliot campaign from Patrick Graham's campaign so it's possible the point of allowing Patrick to run that could be true too I think it does rely on him clearing his name which he probably already said he would have done but there's other allegations I think need to be addressed and I'm sure if if the ethics commissioner found Patrick Brown to be guilty Christine Elliot wouldn't allow him to run for her or anyone probably if he was actually found to be guilty of that but if he was found to be innocent I suspect that it could be in play at the carbon tax thing I don't really understand like why let's say Patrick why does Patrick Brown at this point care if the party is Pro carbon tax or not you know it's a good point maybe to profess look I was on the right side of history even Christine understands that to fund all the promises and the people's guarantee we need that the carbon tax but Tommy attend you know there's a huge black cloud or clouds plural hanging over Patrick Brown's head but nevertheless he does have a lot of supporters if this is indeed a deal that has been cemented could it proved fatal to Doug come Saturday when the leadership convention takes place I think that it's certainly right now if I had to place money on the race I would fix the spec that Christine Elliott is going to win because of this I you know it's hard for me to say how much sway Patrick round has certainly his I mean I think the estimates I know he said 200,000 members but it was more like 120,000 members certainly a lot of those people were Patrick Brown supporters and he had a lot of very good organizers and in different communities in different regions of Ontario that would have a lot of influence and be able to help sway people towards one candidate versus another so he would be a person that the leadership candidates like Christine Eliot would want they would if they don't necessarily just want Patrick they want his organizers and his team and that's somewhere he has influence so that could help sway and help Christine get into the lead because it's probably going to come down to Christine versus Doug and indeed it is looking like a two horse race at this stage that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the Ezra Levante show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought you'd like this video so we put it on YouTube if you want to subscribe to watch The Daily Show every day including always two interviews today and I read my hate mail just click on this screen and become a Premium Member you
