00:00:10,853 --> 00:00:11,587
>> Martha: STORY OF THE NIGHT

2
00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:11,988
RIGHT HERE.

3
00:00:11,988 --> 00:00:12,689
A MICHIGAN COUPLE GETTING THE

4
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:13,456
SHOCK OF THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY

5
00:00:13,456 --> 00:00:14,257
GOT AN ALERT FROM THEIR SECURITY

6
00:00:14,257 --> 00:00:16,091
CAMERA IN THE DRIVEWAY.

7
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:17,493
>> IT WAS KIND OF LIKE REALLY

8
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:18,261
UNUSUAL.

9
00:00:18,261 --> 00:00:19,228
I'VE NEVER, EVER SEEN ANYTHING

10
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:19,562
LIKE IT.

11
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:21,931
>> I WAS LIKE WOW.

12
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:23,399
THAT IS AN ANGEL.

13
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,200
>> THE PHOTOS ARE EXACTLY HOW

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,902
THEY WERE TAKEN.

15
00:00:26,035 --> 00:00:27,603
I THINK IT'S AN ANGEL.

16
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:29,939
>> Martha: TAKE A GOOD LOOK.

17
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:31,607
MANY, INCLUDING THEIR PASTOR

18
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,810
SAID THAT THEY BELIEVE THIS

19
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,877
IMAGE, CAPTURED, CAPTURED BY A

20
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:36,846
SECURITY CAMERA SHOWS AN ANGEL

21
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:37,647
HOVERING OVER THE FAMILY STRUCK

22
00:00:37,647 --> 00:00:38,014
LAST WEEK.

23
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:39,048
SO COULD IT BE?

24
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:40,249
AND IN THE NEXT PICTURE, I THINK

25
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,651
WE HAVE IT, IT SORT OF LOOKS

26
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:45,455
LIKE IT HAS MOVED TO A DIFFERENT

27
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:46,823
PART OVER THE TRUCK.

28
00:00:46,823 --> 00:00:48,057
JOINING ME NOW IS AN EXPERT.

29
00:00:48,057 --> 00:00:49,358
PASTOR DON PIPER WHO WAS WRITTEN

30
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:51,594
ABOUT HIS OWN EXPERIENCE.

31
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,496
HE WAS IN A TERRIBLE CAR

32
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:54,430
ACCIDENT AND HE SAYS HE DIED AND

33
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,633
WENT TO HEAVEN AND CAME BACK.

34
00:00:57,633 --> 00:01:00,403
HE IS THE AUTHOR OF "PEOPLE I

35
00:01:00,403 --> 00:01:02,071
MET AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN."

36
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:05,808
PASTOR, GOOD TO SEE YOU TONIGHT.

37
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:06,909
I'M SURE THAT YOU BELIEVE THESE

38
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,778
FOLKS WHEN THEY SAY THAT AN

39
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:09,212
ANGEL, RIGHT?

40
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:11,614
>> I DO.

41
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:12,815
I THINK WE ARE AROUND THEM ALL

42
00:01:12,815 --> 00:01:13,182
THE TIME.

43
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:19,155
THE BIBLE SAYS THAT WE SHOULD

44
00:01:19,155 --> 00:01:20,523
TREAT STRANGERS WITH ABSOLUTE

45
00:01:20,523 --> 00:01:25,128
COURTESY BECAUSE WE NEVER KNOW

46
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:25,828
IF THEY ARE AN ANGEL AND WHAT

47
00:01:25,828 --> 00:01:26,496
THAT SAYS IT IS WE ARE TO

48
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:27,997
PROBABLY TREAT EACH OTHER BETTER

49
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:31,200
AS HUMANS, BUT IT ALSO SAYS THAT

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,468
ANGELS ARE EVERYWHERE AND WE MAY

51
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,137
NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHO WE ARE

52
00:01:34,137 --> 00:01:34,804
TALKING TO.

53
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:37,140
IT COULD BE AN ANGEL FLYING

54
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,209
ABOVE OUR TRUCK AND ANYTIME,

55
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,344
ANYPLACE, ANYWHERE.

56
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:44,113
>> Martha: THIS WAS A MOTION

57
00:01:44,113 --> 00:01:45,214
ACTIVATED SECURITY CAMERA THAT

58
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:46,449
THEY KEEP ATTACHED TO THEIR HOME

59
00:01:46,449 --> 00:01:47,216
TO LOOK OUT OVER THEIR DRIVEWAY

60
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:49,619
AND THEIR CAR.

61
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,053
SO THEY BELIEVE THAT THE MOTION

62
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:55,558
OF THIS ANGEL THAT THEY FEEL

63
00:01:55,558 --> 00:01:57,393
THEY SAW IS WHAT SET OFF THE

64
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,428
MOTION DETECTOR AND THEY WERE

65
00:01:59,428 --> 00:02:00,429
ABLE TO TRAP IT ON THE VIDEO,

66
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:01,297
WHICH YOU CAN DO IF YOU HAVE ONE

67
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,200
OF THESE CAMERAS.

68
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,602
IT'S A VERY STUNNING, BEAUTIFUL

69
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:07,670
IMAGE THAT THEY GOT.

70
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,771
BUT TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

71
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:12,175
YOUR EXPERIENCE, PASTOR PIPER.

72
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:14,811
YOU WERE IN A CAR CRASH AND YOU

73
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:15,645
SAY THAT YOU ARE TRANSPORTED

74
00:02:15,645 --> 00:02:16,813
INSTANTLY TO THE GATES OF

75
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:17,446
HEAVEN.

76
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:19,448
TELL ME ABOUT THAT.

77
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,449
>> EXACTLY.

78
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:21,551
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS

79
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,619
AT THE MOMENT OF DEATH, AND I

80
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:24,287
WAS KILLED IN A HEAD-ON

81
00:02:24,287 --> 00:02:26,355
COLLISION WITH AN 18-WHEELER,

82
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,591
TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK.

83
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:30,693
WE ARE ABSENT FROM THIS BODY AND

84
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:31,627
PRESENT WITH THE LORD.

85
00:02:31,627 --> 00:02:33,496
IF WE ARE PREPARED TO GO, I

86
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:34,263
WASN'T PLANNING TO DIE THAT DAY

87
00:02:34,263 --> 00:02:36,632
BUT I WAS READY AND IT WAS

88
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:44,407
TRANSPORTED BY ANGELS IN THE

89
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,411
TRANSPORTED TO HEAVEN BY ANGELS

90
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:50,980
TO ABRAHAM'S BOSOM, AND THAT'S

91
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,215
ANOTHER EUPHEMISM IN THE BIBLE

92
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,015
FOR HEAVEN ITSELF.

93
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:55,184
IF WE GO THERE BY VIRTUE OF

94
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:55,518
ANGELS.

95
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:56,552
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH

96
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,887
SOMEONE WHO WAS DYING FEEL LIKE

97
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,155
THERE'S A PRESENCE IN THE ROOM

98
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:02,058
AND USUALLY THERE IS AND I

99
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:02,825
ARRIVED AT THE GATES OF HEAVEN

100
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:03,659
AND WAS GREETED BY PEOPLE WHO

101
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,195
HELPED ME GET TO HEAVEN WHO

102
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:07,797
PRECEDED ME IN DEATH.

103
00:03:07,797 --> 00:03:09,031
I WAS SURROUNDED BY A LOT OF

104
00:03:09,031 --> 00:03:11,667
HUMANS, BUT THERE WERE ANGELS

105
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,502
ANGELS ARE NOT JUST LITTLE

106
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:16,606
CHERUBS PLAYING HARPS ON CLOUDS.

107
00:03:16,606 --> 00:03:17,740
THESE ARE ROBUST AMAZING

108
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,407
CREATURES.

109
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,809
SOME HAVE SIX WINGS.

110
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:22,044
SOME HAVE FOUR, SOME HAVE TWO.

111
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:22,645
SOME HAVE NONE.

112
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:24,247
BUT I COULD HEAR THEIR VOICES

113
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,716
AND I COULD ACTUALLY HEAR THEIR

114
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:27,984
WINGS.

115
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:28,718
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

116
00:03:28,718 --> 00:03:30,386
WAS MOST STUNNING AND MOST

117
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:32,722
ENCOURAGING AND COMFORTING.

118
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:33,256
>> Martha: AMAZING.

119
00:03:33,256 --> 00:03:34,056
YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU WERE

120
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,492
THERE -- I JUST WANT TO PUT UP A

121
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:38,094
GLASS PIPE DEMOGRAPHIC ABOUT THE

122
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:38,794
NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACCORDING TO

123
00:03:38,794 --> 00:03:39,896
GALLUP WHO BELIEVE IN ANGELS AND

124
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,264
EVERYBODY WANTS TO BELIEVE IN

125
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:41,998
ANGELS.

126
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,233
72% SAY THEY DO AND YOU CAN SEE

127
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,402
THE OTHER NUMBERS THERE.

128
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,436
YOU SAY THAT EVERYONE THAT YOU

129
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,038
SAW WHEN YOU WENT TO HEAVEN WAS

130
00:03:49,038 --> 00:03:52,608
SOMEONE THAT YOU KNEW.

131
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:53,442
>> THEY WERE.

132
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,343
I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT I DID

133
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:56,913
NOT KNOW IN THIS LIFE WERE

134
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:57,246
INSIDE.

135
00:03:57,246 --> 00:03:58,414
THEY DID NOT COME OUT TO GREET

136
00:03:58,414 --> 00:03:58,681
ME.

137
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,050
I THINK THE ONES I GREETED AT

138
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,884
THE GATES OF HEAVEN WERE THE

139
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,619
ONES WHO HELPED ME GET THERE.

140
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,421
WHICH OF COURSE WHEN I CAME

141
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:06,222
BACK, THAT MOTIVATED ME ALL THE

142
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,424
MORE TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE INTO

143
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:09,492
HEAVEN BECAUSE I KNOW THOSE

144
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:10,760
PEOPLE HELPED ME GET THERE THE

145
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,262
QUESTION ULTIMATELY IS WHO ARE

146
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:14,030
YOU GOING TO GREET?

147
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,564
WHO ARE WE GOING TO GREET WHEN

148
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:16,065
WE GO THERE?

149
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:17,266
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE

150
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:19,869
PEOPLE WE HELP GET THERE.

151
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,070
THERE WAS AN ANGEL BACK HERE ON

152
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,137
EARTH WHEN I RETURN.

153
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:24,206
A MAN CLIMBED IN THE CAR OF THE

154
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:25,207
WRECKAGE BECAUSE HE FELT LIKE I

155
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:25,608
TOLD HIM TO.

156
00:04:25,608 --> 00:04:29,612
HE PRAYED OVER THE BODY AND I

157
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:30,279
DID RETURN BECAUSE A LOT OF

158
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,447
PEOPLE WERE PRAYING FOR ME WHO

159
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:34,183
DID NOT ALREADY KNOW I WAS DEAD.

160
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:36,085
IT WHEN I CAME BACK, I MET HIM

161
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:37,086
THREE WEEKS LATER AFTER I

162
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:38,688
RECOVERED ENOUGH TO BE CONSCIOUS

163
00:04:38,688 --> 00:04:41,891
AND I TOLD HIM THANK YOU.

164
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:45,227
THANK YOU FOR PRAYING FOR ME.

165
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:46,128
I FOUND THAT HE PRAYED FOR ME,

166
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:48,497
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HE HELD MY

167
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,198
HAND.

168
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:49,966
>> Martha: THAT'S AN AMAZING

169
00:04:49,966 --> 00:00:00,000
STORY.
