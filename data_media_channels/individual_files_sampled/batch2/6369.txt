the healthcare debate among senators rages on and of course Republicans are trying to rush a vote for a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act before the procedural instructions run out of time and all of a sudden they will have to do more than just get a simple majority in the Senate in order to pass this replacement proposal now Mike Pence has chimed in on this debate and recently he was on Fox and Friends talking about some of the potential flaws in the proposal and what they might do to fix it take a look what do you say when governors say like Korea Governor Christie I'm getting four billion less I'm not for this well it's it's absolutely true to say the Gramm Cassady bill over time levels out on a per person basis the way we distribute money on healthcare which I think resonates with most Americans that we will ultimately get to a place where the resources that are available to States are based on an on on a per individual basis and and we'll get to that but there is time in the days ahead and in future budgets to to address those issues as they arrive okay so I just want to clarify something and and it's something that we talked about on the show yesterday but just to reiterate there were some states or there are some states under the Affordable Care Act that received more money than other states and this is of course federal money in order to help subsidize health insurance now the reason why some states received much more money is because they agreed to play ball with the Affordable Care Act meaning they agreed to expand Medicare in their states there are other states red states in particular who did not care about the best interests of their constituents refused to take that money because they refused to take advantage of the positive components of the Affordable Care Act and so I just want to make that clear because Republicans are spitting that and making it seem as though all the liberal states are getting all this money while the red states are getting screwed over by the Affordable Care Act that was the decision by the lawmakers in those states yeah they could have gotten the money as well all they do is ask for it and it was so that their voters their constituents could I we have better health care they said no we don't want our citizens to have better health care so even though it's money we can take we're not gonna take it and we're gonna deny our own citizens so that was their decision now on this pence video I'm greatly amused by one thing he said now so first he said look this levels out purpur on a per person basis okay in other words yes we're cutting the funds okay it's a funny politically correct way to say we're cutting funding and then but the amusing part was he followed that up by saying I think this Rose really resonates with the American people which the leveling out per person nobody knows what that means the American people it doesn't resonate with anybody you're just saying yeah oh man people are gonna love it when we cut their health care if you say so big guy let me jump in on that because keep in mind that they try to do this without getting any attention right they wanted to jam it through a vote they didn't want Americans to have an opportunity to reflect on it or analyze it they don't even want the Congressional Budget Office to have the time to analyze it and see whether or not people are going to lose health insurance coverage through this proposal which by the way they will which is why they're trying to rush it through a vote so they don't care or even consider how Americans feel about it they didn't want to give them an opportunity to think about it are you kidding me if it was popular they'd be parading it up and down the street they take their time they say look at what the CBO scores we're so proud of it didn't do all those things they're not try to do any of that they're trying to sneak it in because they know it's not popular a similar version of this bill when it was introduced earlier you know what popularity in had in America seventeen percent that is disastrously low you know what that's going to lead to a leveling out poor politician on the Republican side in other words your ratings are gonna go way down and you know it so lying about how it resonates with the American people is hilarious senators have been dodging the question in regard to whether or not people will get coverage if they have a pre-existing condition Pence is no exception when it comes to the dodging take a look folks like Jimmy Kimmel they're worried about the pre-existing thing because this will be up to the governor's to decide how the money is dispersed who gets coverage every state will determine what's best for their for their folks but with that can you guarantee that these governors will make sure pre-existing conditions are covered Thomas Jefferson said government that governs least governs best I mean the question that people ought to ask is who do you think will be more responsive to the health care needs in your community your governor and your state legislature or a congressman and a president and a far-off nation's capital yeah we no one asked you a philosophical question about the role of government we just want to know whether or not people with pre-existing conditions will get coverage now let's be just absolutely clear you guys heard that for yourself that means no you will not be covered if you have a pre-existing condition because she asked a very clear question to her credit on Fox and Friends okay and he did not answer the question he's instead he said well we're gonna leave it up to the states because that's what Thomas Jefferson would want in other words yes your state can allow for insurance that takes away protections for people with pre-existing conditions so that is absolutely clear it so that I actually prove Jimmy Kimmel's point that Louisiana Senator was in fact lying this does not cover pre-existing conditions Donald Trump when he says it does of course is telling us billionth lie in a row and you could tell because the vice president just told in a point-blank question his pre-existing conditions guaranteed to be covered and he said no it's gonna be up to the states like Jefferson would want there it is look it's clear that they are not doing anything that's gonna benefit us there's a reason why they don't want the public to reflect on it and analyze that there's a reason why they don't want to give the CBO an opportunity to do it there's a reason why they're rushing this so they can pass it with a simple majority rather than having a larger portion of the Senate agree on it and it's just pathetic and the reason why this story is getting attention is because people are more aware of what's going on in politics today and because people like Jimmy Kimmel continue to harp on this issue with good reason okay so finally I I'm amused by the idea of Republicans quoting giant progressives in history whenever they think it suits their purpose Oh Martin Luther King I mean he would have been a Republican he know yeah of course yeah I mean he sure everybody of course look at the actual history of Martin Luther King and by the way what he actually said about Republicans even though at that time they were just being to switch over to being the far-right insane party that they wound up developing he could see that a head down and Jefferson Jefferson was a radical liberal he was so radical he did a revolution against the establishment giving jeffers whoever like oh and draconian plans with that screws over the american people I kind of love it that's sure you got the right guy there buddy help us build independent media together
