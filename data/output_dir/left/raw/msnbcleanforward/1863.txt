THEY SAY, DID HE SAY THAT? COULD IT HAVE BEEN?

00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,047
COULD IT HAVE BEEN? DID HE SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE

DID HE SAY SOMETHING POSITIVE ABOUT RUSSIA?

00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,640
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE COHEN NEWS MEANS?

36
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,175
MEANS? >> I THINK IT CONFIRMS WHAT WE

37
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,510
>> I THINK IT CONFIRMS WHAT WE EXPECTED ALL ALONG.

38
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:28,078
EXPECTED ALL ALONG. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCONCEIVABLE

39
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,513
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCONCEIVABLE FOR DONALD TRUMP NOT TO HAVE

40
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,949
FOR DONALD TRUMP NOT TO HAVE KNOWN HIS SON, HIS SON-IN-LAW,

41
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,983
KNOWN HIS SON, HIS SON-IN-LAW, CAMPAIGN MANAGER WERE ALL

42
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,751
CAMPAIGN MANAGER WERE ALL MEETING ON THE FLOOR ABOVE HIS

43
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,387
MEETING ON THE FLOOR ABOVE HIS OFFICE WITH A BUNCH OF RUSSIANS.

44
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:37,955
OFFICE WITH A BUNCH OF RUSSIANS. I THINK THIS KIND OF FILLS IN

45
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,589
I THINK THIS KIND OF FILLS IN THE BLANK.

46
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,191
THE BLANK. THERE WILL BE OTHER

47
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,892
THERE WILL BE OTHER CORROBORATING INFORMATION WHEN

48
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:42,659
CORROBORATING INFORMATION WHEN THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR GETS

49
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,595
THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR GETS THOSE BLOCKED CALLS THAT CAME

50
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,197
THOSE BLOCKED CALLS THAT CAME FROM DONALD TRUMP JR., PROBABLY

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,897
FROM DONALD TRUMP JR., PROBABLY TO HIS FATHER.

52
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:49,233
TO HIS FATHER. IT WILL FIT A PATTERN.

53
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:50,701
IT WILL FIT A PATTERN. BUT I THINK THIS REMINDS US OF

54
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,469
BUT I THINK THIS REMINDS US OF SOMETHING ELSE.

55
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,871
SOMETHING ELSE. WE KNOW A FRACTION OF THE FACTS

56
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:54,572
WE KNOW A FRACTION OF THE FACTS OUT THERE.

57
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:55,606
OUT THERE. EVERYONE THINKS WE’RE CLOSE TO

58
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,340
EVERYONE THINKS WE’RE CLOSE TO THE END.

59
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:59,176
THE END. I DON’T THINK WE’RE VERY NEAR

60
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,077
I DON’T THINK WE’RE VERY NEAR THE END.

61
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,812
THE END. I THINK WE’RE IN THE MIDDLE.

62
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,980
I THINK WE’RE IN THE MIDDLE. THERE’S A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF

63
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:04,115
THERE’S A TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF WITNESSES WHO HAVE YET TO TALK

64
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,484
WITNESSES WHO HAVE YET TO TALK TO THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR.

65
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:07,218
TO THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR. THOSE PEOPLE IN TURN ARE GOING

66
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:07,885
THOSE PEOPLE IN TURN ARE GOING TO TURN OVER OTHER PEOPLE.

67
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,921
TO TURN OVER OTHER PEOPLE. WE SAW A NEW CHARACTER

68
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,389
WE SAW A NEW CHARACTER INTRODUCED WHEN MICHAEL COHEN

69
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:13,024
INTRODUCED WHEN MICHAEL COHEN INTRODUCED THE NAME OF THE CFO

70
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,460
INTRODUCED THE NAME OF THE CFO OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION.

71
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,395
OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.

72
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,029
SO WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. I DO THINK MICHAEL COHEN IS

73
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:21,266
I DO THINK MICHAEL COHEN IS FRONT AND CENTER.

74
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,533
FRONT AND CENTER. HE’S AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE

75
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,534
HE’S AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE WOMEN, THE RUSSIANS AND THE

76
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:23,868
WOMEN, THE RUSSIANS AND THE MONEY.

77
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:26,837
MONEY. >> WE’LL COME BACK TO THAT,

78
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:27,338
>> WE’LL COME BACK TO THAT, BECAUSE IT’S TRUE.

79
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:28,539
BECAUSE IT’S TRUE. IT’S ALL SORT OF LUMPING

80
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:28,906
IT’S ALL SORT OF LUMPING TOGETHER.

81
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,409

00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,473
TO TAMP DOWN THE INQUIRY. WE NOW HAVE THE POTENTIAL THAT

00:03:01,483 --> 00:03:03,041
WE NOW HAVE THE POTENTIAL THAT DONALD TRUMP’S TWEETS ABOUT JEFF

101
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:07,178
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM. >> IT’S RIGHT.

102
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,546
>> IT’S RIGHT. ONE THING PEOPLE SAY ABOUT

103
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,181
ONE THING PEOPLE SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP OFTENTIMES IS

104
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:10,882
DONALD TRUMP OFTENTIMES IS NOTHING MATTERS.

105
00:03:10,892 --> 00:03:12,083
NOTHING MATTERS. IN FACT, EVERYTHING MATTERS.

106
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:13,484
IN FACT, EVERYTHING MATTERS. AND EVERYTHING HE SAYS PUBLICLY

107
00:03:13,495 --> 00:03:15,253
AND EVERYTHING HE SAYS PUBLICLY MATTERS JUST LIKE HE SAYS

108
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:15,787
MATTERS JUST LIKE HE SAYS PRIVATELY MATTERS.

109
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:17,455
PRIVATELY MATTERS. ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT HIS

00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:20,458
ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT HIS TWEETS, THEY ARE IN SOME WAY HIS

TWEETS, THEY ARE IN SOME WAY HIS MOST UNFILTERED, UNVARNISHED

112
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:23,061
MOST UNFILTERED, UNVARNISHED THOUGHTS.

113
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:24,663
THOUGHTS. IT’S WHAT HE SAYS IN THE WHITE

114
00:03:24,673 --> 00:03:26,064
IT’S WHAT HE SAYS IN THE WHITE HOUSE BY HIMSELF, BEFORE HE’S

115
00:03:26,074 --> 00:03:28,200
HOUSE BY HIMSELF, BEFORE HE’S GONE INTO THE WEST WING, HIS

116
00:03:28,243 --> 00:03:29,368
GONE INTO THE WEST WING, HIS MOST ANGRY TIMES WHERE HE SAYS

117
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,001
MOST ANGRY TIMES WHERE HE SAYS WHAT HE WANTS.

118
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:31,703
WHAT HE WANTS. NOT FILTERED THROUGH WHITE HOUSE

119
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:33,471
NOT FILTERED THROUGH WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL, NOT FILTERED THROUGH

120
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:34,206
COUNSEL, NOT FILTERED THROUGH HIS OUTSIDE ATTORNEYS.

121
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:35,006
HIS OUTSIDE ATTORNEYS. IT’S WHAT HE MEANS.

122
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:36,608
IT’S WHAT HE MEANS. I THINK WHAT YOU’LL SEE THE

123
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:37,809
I THINK WHAT YOU’LL SEE THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR DO IS PIECE

124
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,645
SPECIAL PROSECUTOR DO IS PIECE THEM TOGETHER WITH HIS PRIVATE

125
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,013
THEM TOGETHER WITH HIS PRIVATE ACTIONS.

126
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:42,481
ACTIONS. THEY’LL USE THE TWEETS TO TRY TO

127
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:43,515
THEY’LL USE THE TWEETS TO TRY TO SHOW HIS MOTIVE.

128
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,550
SHOW HIS MOTIVE. WHY DID HE FIRE JIM COMEY?

129
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:48,086
WHY DID HE FIRE JIM COMEY? WHY DID HE TRY TO PUSH JEFF

130
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,020
WHY DID HE TRY TO PUSH JEFF SESSIONS OUT OF THE WAY?

131
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,223
SESSIONS OUT OF THE WAY? WHY DID HE TRY TO PUSH ROD

132
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,324
WHY DID HE TRY TO PUSH ROD ROSENSTEIN OUT OF THE WAY?

133
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:53,091
ROSENSTEIN OUT OF THE WAY? IT’S BECAUSE HE WANTS THE

134
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:54,593
IT’S BECAUSE HE WANTS THE INVESTIGATION TO GO AWAY.

135
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:55,928
INVESTIGATION TO GO AWAY. >> THERE’S ALWAYS THIS QUESTION

136
00:03:55,971 --> 00:03:58,030
>> THERE’S ALWAYS THIS QUESTION OF DONALD TRUMP’S ONE-WAY

137
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,565
OF DONALD TRUMP’S ONE-WAY LOYALTY AND TO WHOM IT EXTENDS

138
00:03:59,608 --> 00:04:01,934
LOYALTY AND TO WHOM IT EXTENDS WHEN HE RETURNS IT.

139
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:03,302
WHEN HE RETURNS IT. YOU HAVE MICHAEL COHEN WHO IS

140
00:04:03,312 --> 00:04:05,137
YOU HAVE MICHAEL COHEN WHO IS NOW OUT THERE ON HIS OWN.

141
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:06,805
NOW OUT THERE ON HIS OWN. IT’S VERY CLEAR HE’S BEEN CUT

142
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,208
IT’S VERY CLEAR HE’S BEEN CUT OFF BY TRUMP WORLD AND THEY ARE

143
00:04:09,218 --> 00:04:13,612
OFF BY TRUMP WORLD AND THEY ARE NOW AT LOGGERHEADS WITH EACH

144
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:15,047

149
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:22,755
ASKING FOR A PROFFER OF LOYALTY. THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES

150
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,223
THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHETHER THAT LOYALTY EXTENDS TO

151
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:26,158
WHETHER THAT LOYALTY EXTENDS TO HIS SON.

ACTUALLY BE SHARED WITH HIS SON? I THINK THAT QUESTION REMAINS.

191
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:34,994
I THINK THAT QUESTION REMAINS. IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO SEE.

192
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:36,329
IT WILL BE FASCINATING TO SEE. I THINK THE PRESSURE IS BEING

BROUGHT TO BEAR BY, PERHAPS, IVANKA AND OTHERS IN THE FAMILY

IVANKA AND OTHERS IN THE FAMILY MIGHT MAKE HIM FEEL A CERTAIN

196
00:05:41,244 --> 00:05:42,335
MIGHT MAKE HIM FEEL A CERTAIN PASSION HE MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,228
IN. AND I THINK THEY’VE MADE A

DECISION, IF YOU CAN THINK OF IT AS A RATIONALE DECISION, WHICH

IS HE KNOWS SO MUCH, WE JUST HAVE TO RUIN THE GUY.

HAVE TO RUIN THE GUY. WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM SEEM LIKE A

WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM SEEM LIKE A COMPLETE LIAR.

280
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,772
COMPLETE LIAR. THAT’S SHORT-SIGHTED THINKING

281
00:07:57,782 --> 00:07:59,340
THAT’S SHORT-SIGHTED THINKING BECAUSE THEY’RE GOING TO BE

282
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:01,075
BECAUSE THEY’RE GOING TO BE CORROBORATING WITNESSES FOR WHAT

283

CORROBORATING WITNESSES FOR WHAT MICHAEL COHEN IS SAYING.

THESE PEOPLE HAVE LEFT A TRAIL OF EVIDENCE A MILE WIDE.

292
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:19,360
OF EVIDENCE A MILE WIDE. I THINK THEIR INCLINATION WE’LL

293
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,795
I THINK THEIR INCLINATION WE’LL JUST RUIN HIM COMES FROM THEIR

294
00:08:20,805 --> 00:08:21,996
JUST RUIN HIM COMES FROM THEIR POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, WE’RE JUST

00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:23,097
POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, WE’RE JUST RUIN THE PEOPLE ATTACKING US.

296
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,333
RUIN THE PEOPLE ATTACKING US. IT DOESN’T WORK IN THE LEGAL

297
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,702
IT DOESN’T WORK IN THE LEGAL REALM BECAUSE THERE ARE FACTS

298
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:28,736
REALM BECAUSE THERE ARE FACTS THAT MATTER AND EVIDENCE THAT

THAT MATTER AND EVIDENCE THAT MATTERS AND THERE’S A WHOLE

SO, YEAH, IT’S STUDENT BUT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO THAT.

304

UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DO THAT. THEY ALWAYS OPERATE THIS WAY.

305
00:08:38,056 --> 00:08:39,380
THEY ALWAYS OPERATE THIS WAY. >> IT’S ALSO -- THEY’RE NOT

WINNING IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION ANYMORE EITHER.

308
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:43,718

THEY EXPECTED THAT THAT WOULD MAYBE SUPERCEDE AND PREVAIL, GET

310
00:08:45,563 --> 00:08:47,121
MAYBE SUPERCEDE AND PREVAIL, GET THEM THROUGH THE NEXT ELECTION

NUMBERS DROP AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HELPED HIM GET ELECTED.

314
00:08:52,837 --> 00:08:54,329
WHO HELPED HIM GET ELECTED. THERE’S A VERY SMALL NARROWING,

THERE’S A VERY SMALL NARROWING, HARD BASE THAT WILL BE THERE.

316

00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,548
GOT A HARD AND FAST BASE BUT IT’S SMALLER AND SMALLER AND

327
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:13,848
IT’S SMALLER AND SMALLER AND SMALLER.

328
00:09:13,892 --> 00:09:15,216
SMALLER. AT THE SAME SOMETIME, ELECTED

329
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,118
AT THE SAME SOMETIME, ELECTED REPUBLICANS ARE JOINING IN THIS

330
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,654
REPUBLICANS ARE JOINING IN THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN BRINGS DOWN

331
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:22,857
IDEA THAT YOU CAN BRINGS DOWN THE REPUTATION OF A CHRISTOPHER

332
00:09:22,901 --> 00:09:24,559
THE REPUTATION OF A CHRISTOPHER STEELE, OF A BOB ROBERT MUELLER

333
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:30,698
STEELE, OF A BOB ROBERT MUELLER AND ROSENSTEIN.

334
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:31,566
AND ROSENSTEIN. THERE WAS TALK OF IMPEACHING

335
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:31,833
THERE WAS TALK OF IMPEACHING HIM.

336
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:35,170
HIM. MARK MEADOWS OF NORTH CAROLINA

337
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,571
MARK MEADOWS OF NORTH CAROLINA HAS BACKED OFF THAT AFTER

338
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:37,405
HAS BACKED OFF THAT AFTER LEADERSHIP INTERVENED.

339
00:09:37,449 --> 00:09:39,474
LEADERSHIP INTERVENED. THAT IDEA IS ON THE TABLE, OF

340
00:09:39,518 --> 00:09:42,544
THAT IDEA IS ON THE TABLE, OF TRYING TO TAKE DOWN ROD

341
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:42,977
TRYING TO TAKE DOWN ROD ROSENSTEIN.

342
00:09:42,988 --> 00:09:44,479
ROSENSTEIN. >> SOMETIMES THE OBSTRUCTION OF

343
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:46,247
>> SOMETIMES THE OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE IS RIGHT OUT IN THE

344
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:46,581
JUSTICE IS RIGHT OUT IN THE OPEN.

345
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:47,783
OPEN. YOU SEE DONALD TRUMP DOING IT.

346
00:09:47,826 --> 00:09:49,684
YOU SEE DONALD TRUMP DOING IT. HE TRIES TO DO IT ON TWITTER.

347
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:50,618
HE TRIES TO DO IT ON TWITTER. THAT’S WHAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS

348
00:09:50,662 --> 00:09:51,486
THAT’S WHAT HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO.

349
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,854
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY WAY

350
00:09:52,898 --> 00:09:55,090
THEY ARE LOOKING FOR ANY WAY THEY CAN TO SHUT DOWN THE

351
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:55,524
THEY CAN TO SHUT DOWN THE INVESTIGATION.

352
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:56,491
INVESTIGATION. IF THEY CAN’T SHUT DOWN THE

353
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,159
IF THEY CAN’T SHUT DOWN THE INVESTIGATION, THEY WANT TO

354
00:09:58,203 --> 00:09:59,995
INVESTIGATION, THEY WANT TO DISCREDIT IT BECAUSE THEY

355
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:01,196
DISCREDIT IT BECAUSE THEY REALIZED THIS ISN’T AS LIKELY

356
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,264
REALIZED THIS ISN’T AS LIKELY WITH RESPECT TO DONALD TRUMP TO

357
00:10:02,307 --> 00:10:03,665
WITH RESPECT TO DONALD TRUMP TO END UP IN FRONT OF A JURY, AS

358
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:04,499
END UP IN FRONT OF A JURY, AS LONG AS HE’S PRESIDENT.

359
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:09,804
LONG AS HE’S PRESIDENT. I THINK THAT HAD MUELLER AND

360
00:10:09,815 --> 00:10:10,572
I THINK THAT HAD MUELLER AND ROSENSTEIN WILL RESPECT THE

361
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:11,974
ROSENSTEIN WILL RESPECT THE LONG-STANDING DOJ PRESIDENT.

362
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:13,909
LONG-STANDING DOJ PRESIDENT. IF IT ENDS UP OF CRIMINALITY ON

363
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,010
IF IT ENDS UP OF CRIMINALITY ON BEHALF OF DONALD TRUMP, IT WILL

364
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,614
BEHALF OF DONALD TRUMP, IT WILL WIND UP IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE

365
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:19,482
WIND UP IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND

366
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:20,382
IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS AND THAT’S A POLITICAL CASE WHERE

367
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:22,418
THAT’S A POLITICAL CASE WHERE THE OPINION OF THE AMERICAN

368
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:23,018
THE OPINION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MATTER.

369
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:25,020
PEOPLE MATTER. HIS BASE MAY BE SMALLER BUT

370
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,354
HIS BASE MAY BE SMALLER BUT STRONG.

371
00:10:25,397 --> 00:10:26,622
STRONG. THEY’RE TALKING TO THIS NARROW

372
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:28,057
THEY’RE TALKING TO THIS NARROW AUDIENCE SAYING, YOU CAN’T

373
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,024
AUDIENCE SAYING, YOU CAN’T BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE.

374
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:30,592
BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE. IT DOESN’T MATTER IF THEY HAVE

375
00:10:30,636 --> 00:10:32,294
IT DOESN’T MATTER IF THEY HAVE TO BURN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

376
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:33,929
TO BURN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOWN TO CONVINCE PEOPLE AND HAVE

377
00:10:33,972 --> 00:10:35,431
DOWN TO CONVINCE PEOPLE AND HAVE AFFECTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT’S

378
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:37,533
AFFECTS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT’S ABILITY TO DO ITS JOB NOT JUST

379
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:39,869
ABILITY TO DO ITS JOB NOT JUST IN THIS ONE, BUT IN TERRORISM

380
00:10:39,912 --> 00:10:40,703
IN THIS ONE, BUT IN TERRORISM CASES BECAUSE PEOPLE WON’T TRUST

381
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:42,204
CASES BECAUSE PEOPLE WON’T TRUST THE FBI, THEY WON’T WANT TO

382
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:43,305
THE FBI, THEY WON’T WANT TO COOPERATE THE FBI, THEY DON’T

383
00:10:43,315 --> 00:10:44,540
COOPERATE THE FBI, THEY DON’T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THOSE

384
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:46,609
CARE ABOUT ANY OF THOSE CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE THEY WANT

385
00:10:46,652 --> 00:10:47,510
CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT AT ANY

386
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:47,810
TO PROTECT THE PRESIDENT AT ANY COST.

387
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,711
COST. >> IT’S EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE THE

388
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,712
>> IT’S EXTRAORDINARY TO SEE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TURN ON THE

389
00:10:49,722 --> 00:10:50,913
REPUBLICAN PARTY TURN ON THE MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

390
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,348
MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY LIKE THE FBI IN THE WAY THEY

391
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:52,648
LIKE THE FBI IN THE WAY THEY HAVE.

392
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:53,482
HAVE. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT

393
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:54,917
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS AS WELL.

394
00:10:54,927 --> 00:10:57,052
THE DEMOCRATS AS WELL. MAYBE THEY DON’T HAVE THE BULLY

395
00:10:57,062 --> 00:10:59,354
MAYBE THEY DON’T HAVE THE BULLY PULPIT, THEY DON’T HAVE THE MEGA

396
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:01,023
PULPIT, THEY DON’T HAVE THE MEGA PHONE, THEY DON’T HAVE THE

397
00:11:01,033 --> 00:11:01,423
PHONE, THEY DON’T HAVE THE MAJORITY.

398
00:11:01,434 --> 00:11:03,125
MAJORITY. DONALD TRUMP WON’T BE IMPEACHED

399
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,927
DONALD TRUMP WON’T BE IMPEACHED AS LONG AS THEY’RE IN POWER BUT

400
00:11:04,937 --> 00:11:06,529
AS LONG AS THEY’RE IN POWER BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN RETICENT

401
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,064
REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN RETICENT TO PUT ON THE TABLE IF THEY WERE

402
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:10,366
TO PUT ON THE TABLE IF THEY WERE IN POWER, IF FOUND GUILTY OF

403
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,768
IN POWER, IF FOUND GUILTY OF CRIMES BY MUELLER, HE WOULD BE

404
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:13,269
CRIMES BY MUELLER, HE WOULD BE IMPEACHED.

405
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,904
IMPEACHED. DEMOCRATS DON’T SEEM TO WANT TO

406
00:11:14,947 --> 00:11:15,337
DEMOCRATS DON’T SEEM TO WANT TO GO THERE.

407
00:11:15,348 --> 00:11:17,440
GO THERE. >> THEY SEEM TO BE SENSITIVE TO

408
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,374
>> THEY SEEM TO BE SENSITIVE TO THIS CREDIT TEAK THEY DON’T HAVE

409
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:19,775
THIS CREDIT TEAK THEY DON’T HAVE A POSITIVE AGENDA FOR THE

410
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:20,076
A POSITIVE AGENDA FOR THE COUNTRY.

411
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:21,411
COUNTRY. THEY’VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF

412
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:22,478
THEY’VE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME AND SPINNING WHEELS TRYING

413
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,180
TIME AND SPINNING WHEELS TRYING TO COME UP WITH SLOGANS AND

414
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,116
TO COME UP WITH SLOGANS AND THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THEIR ISSUE

415
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:27,483
THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THEIR ISSUE AGENDA.

00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:33,856

00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,490

I THINK IS THE LATEST ONE. UNFORTUNATELY -- YES,

00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:41,697
UNFORTUNATELY -- YES, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, HEALTH

425
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,766
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, HEALTH CARE STILL MATTERS.

426
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,067
CARE STILL MATTERS. ECONOMICS STILL MATTER.

427
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:46,402
ECONOMICS STILL MATTER. WHAT THEY’RE DOING TO FOOD

428
00:11:46,446 --> 00:11:47,703
WHAT THEY’RE DOING TO FOOD STAMPS AND EVERYTHING ELSE STILL

429
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:48,038
STAMPS AND EVERYTHING ELSE STILL MATTERS.

430
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:49,872
MATTERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE INTEGRITY

431
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:52,208
AT THE SAME TIME, THE INTEGRITY OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS INCREASINGLY

432
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,310
OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS INCREASINGLY AT THE CENTER, I THINK, OF THE

433
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,878
AT THE CENTER, I THINK, OF THE NATION’S ATTENTION.

434
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,914
NATION’S ATTENTION. AND TO NOT -- AND TO NOT FOCUS

435
00:11:57,924 --> 00:11:59,816
AND TO NOT -- AND TO NOT FOCUS ON THIS IN A REAL WAY IN TERMS

436
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:01,384
ON THIS IN A REAL WAY IN TERMS OF HOW IT’S UNDERCUTTING OUR

437
00:12:01,427 --> 00:12:02,885
OF HOW IT’S UNDERCUTTING OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM, HOW IT’S

438

ELECTORAL SYSTEM, HOW IT’S UNDERCUTTING OUR DEMOCRACY, HOW

439
00:12:03,997 --> 00:12:05,922
UNDERCUTTING OUR DEMOCRACY, HOW IT’S UNDERCUTTING OUR STATES IN

00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:07,524
IT’S UNDERCUTTING OUR STATES IN TERMS OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE

441
00:12:07,534 --> 00:12:11,061
TERMS OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTE IN OUR STATES IS A REALLY,

442
00:12:11,104 --> 00:12:13,029
VOTE IN OUR STATES IS A REALLY, I THINK, IMPORTANT AND EGREGIOUS

443
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:13,897
I THINK, IMPORTANT AND EGREGIOUS OVERSIGHT.

444
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,932
OVERSIGHT. I’M OF THE BREED OF DEMOCRATS

445
00:12:15,975 --> 00:12:16,800
I’M OF THE BREED OF DEMOCRATS WHO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PUT

446
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:19,436
WHO BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PUT IT UP FRONT AND CENTER BECAUSE

447
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:22,205
IT UP FRONT AND CENTER BECAUSE NOBODY WILL HAVE, I THINK, A

448
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:22,939
NOBODY WILL HAVE, I THINK, A BETTER ARGUMENT TO MAKE THAN

449
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:23,940
BETTER ARGUMENT TO MAKE THAN DEMOCRATS IN THE FALL ABOUT WHY

450
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,875
DEMOCRATS IN THE FALL ABOUT WHY WE ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE A

451
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,110
WE ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE A WORKING BRANCH OF CONGRESS THAT

452
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,845
WORKING BRANCH OF CONGRESS THAT ACTUALLY SERVES AS A REAL CHECK

453
00:12:28,855 --> 00:12:30,613
ACTUALLY SERVES AS A REAL CHECK ON THE PRESIDENCY AS OPPOSED TO

454
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,549
ON THE PRESIDENCY AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE HAVE NOW, WHICH ARE

455
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,152
WHAT WE HAVE NOW, WHICH ARE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN WHICH ARE

456
00:12:36,196 --> 00:12:36,753
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN WHICH ARE CLUD

457
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:37,454
CLUD COLLUDING WITH THE REPUBLICAN

458
00:12:37,464 --> 00:12:38,455
COLLUDING WITH THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT WHO HAS CERTAINLY SOME

459
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:40,457
PRESIDENT WHO HAS CERTAINLY SOME VERY QUESTIONABLE, YOU KNOW,

460
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:40,857
VERY QUESTIONABLE, YOU KNOW, INTENTIONS.

461
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:42,459
INTENTIONS. >> IT WOULD BE IRONIC TO SEE THE

462
00:12:42,469 --> 00:12:43,860
>> IT WOULD BE IRONIC TO SEE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO BE THE PARTY

463
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,161
DEMOCRATIC PARTY TO BE THE PARTY THAT HAS TO COME OUT AND DEFEND

464
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:46,663
THAT HAS TO COME OUT AND DEFEND THE FBI, RIGHT?

465
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:47,497
THE FBI, RIGHT? IT WAS TRADITIONALLY REPUBLICANS

466
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,033
IT WAS TRADITIONALLY REPUBLICANS WOULD TRY TO OWN THAT WHOLE LAW

467
00:12:50,044 --> 00:12:50,867
WOULD TRY TO OWN THAT WHOLE LAW ENFORCEMENT SPACE.

468
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:52,669
ENFORCEMENT SPACE. IT IS NOW JUST OPEN FOR ANYONE

469
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:53,937
IT IS NOW JUST OPEN FOR ANYONE WHO CARES TO STEP INTO IT.

470
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,472
WHO CARES TO STEP INTO IT. >> THERE’S ONLY ONE PARTY LEFT

471
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,441
>> THERE’S ONLY ONE PARTY LEFT THAT’S A RULE OF LAW PARTY.

472
00:12:57,451 --> 00:12:58,075
THAT’S A RULE OF LAW PARTY. IT’S CRAZY.

473
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:59,943
IT’S CRAZY. RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN A SETTLED

474
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:00,744
RULE OF LAW HAS BEEN A SETTLED POSITION WHERE BOTH PARTIES

475
00:13:00,754 --> 00:13:02,045
POSITION WHERE BOTH PARTIES SETTLED THE RULE OF LAW.

476
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:02,846
SETTLED THE RULE OF LAW. THAT’S NOT TRUE ANYMORE.

477
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:04,848
THAT’S NOT TRUE ANYMORE. I THINK WITH RESPECT TO WHAT

478
00:13:04,858 --> 00:13:05,983
I THINK WITH RESPECT TO WHAT DEMOCRATS -- THEY HAVE TO RUN ON

479
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:07,384
DEMOCRATS -- THEY HAVE TO RUN ON BEING A CHECK ON AN EXECUTIVE

480
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,852
BEING A CHECK ON AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH THAT’S OUT OF CONTROL.

481
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,487
BRANCH THAT’S OUT OF CONTROL. I -- I’M ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT

00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,855
I -- I’M ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT THINKS IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:13,156
THINKS IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO RUN INTO IMPEACHMENT.

484
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,692
RUN INTO IMPEACHMENT. THIS INVESTIGATION IS NOT OVER.

485
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:16,993
THIS INVESTIGATION IS NOT OVER. LET’S SEE THE FACTS BOB MUELLER

486
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,563
