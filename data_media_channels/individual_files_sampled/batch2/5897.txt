all these numbers mean to the voters to American citizens let's turn now to chief correspondent at the Washington Post covering national politics the presidency and Congress the legend himself Dan Balz his new story titled loyalty unease in Trump's Midwest reflects 16 months of his reporting from the Midwest a region that turned largely to Donald Trump in 2016 dan good morning it's great to have you with us let's talk first about where we are right now you're talking about the Upper Midwest where have you spent most of your time well what I started out to do in January 2017 is simply to understand better what had happened in the election and I went back to a part of the country where I grew up so I had some grounding as to what what this area was like but one of the things I discovered was that there about a hundred counties nationally that had voted five elections at least five elections in a row for democratic nominees and then flipped a trump and about half of those are in the Upper Midwest and in a bunch in Iowa Wisconsin Illinois and Minnesota and so I started to go out and just tried to find some people to sit down with them and talk to them and my editor Steven Ginsburg said don't go out with the idea that we have to write anything right away let's just see what we hear and take it from there that ended up being a 15-month process where I would go intermittently I wasn't living out there by any means but I would go every few months and talk to people and ultimately I kind of focused on half a dozen or so people almost all of them Republicans some Republican local officials some elected officials some ordinary citizens and I tried to get a sense of how they were absorbing the Trump presidency from the idea initially of somebody who many of them had not anticipated would be the force he was in their area who came to support him with some enthusiasm and now as you know as the presidency has unfolded what they think about him and what they think about it and what I think about him well where are they well here's here's the here's the bottom line I would say I put people in about three baskets one group would be what I call still all in they are very enthusiastic about the president they think he is doing what he promised he would do or at least is trying to do that and the degree to which he's unable to be as successful as they would wish is not his fault it's the swamp it's the opposition in some cases it's Republican opposition to some of the things he's doing so so there's a there's a significant portion those make that up well that I mean it Jo it's a it's a variety of people you can't I I can't categorize it as to this type or that type these are people who are you know they're conservative they feel in many ways disrespected by the elites by the east and west coast these are people who are you know they're they're working hard many of them are you know are are making less money probably than they did before and they see in Trump somebody who is you know who is championing the things that they want to see so then then there's another group of that I would say there's a small second group who have have said no more there's one person featured in the piece he's a commercial fisherman who runs a really interesting store in Prairie du Chien Wisconsin he voted for Trump and when I first came across him last summer he said he'd had it he would not vote for him again I went back in April and talked to him for a while same place he just said I voted for change but this is not the change I voted for and what was that third bucket Dan the third bucket I think is the most important and I think it holds the key to Trump's presidency and these are people who I would say are conflicted and they are there are degrees of these people some are quite conflicted by all of the turmoil all of the chaos all of the disruption and yet they see a direction that he's trying to take the country and they see conservative policies that they really like and they are in a sense willing to kind of tolerate things that they're uncomfortable with because they think in policy terms Trump is way way way better than the Democrats would you know then there is another group of these people and I can't quantify it this is not a scientific survey but these are people who are pulling back there's no question that over time as I talked to them they were more and more explicit about their unhappiness with Trump I don't know where they're gonna be in 2020 but right now I would say they're on the fence I guess the question Susan is how many of those people are there how many people who took a chance on Trump and now turning of them and how many more are they have that first group that Dan was talking about that their support is hardened by what they think is an assault on President Trump from the media the establishment and everything else they suspect his is out to get him well it depends how optimistic they are when we look at Steve's numbers there there's not a lot of optimism in those numbers so I think when you when you're trying to figure out what will happen do we for 2020 will those voters feel that there is hope with a new Democratic County or will they just stay with with Donald Trump because at least they know what they have you can read the full story in The Washington Post it is
