Hey guys!
It's Messyourself here.
Now, before you get into this video...
I just wanted to thanks
Monster Legends...
...for sponsoring this video.
If you guys have no idea what Monster Legends...
...is, it's a free app on iOS
and Android.
And you basically have to collect
monsters, okay?!
There are literally hundreds of monsters in the game.
And the main progression is like...
...evolving your monsters, and making them stronger.
By fighting OTHER monsters...
...in like these really
epic battles, okay? The game's great
It's one of those games that's like...
...really addicting. They even
added relics recently in the game.
And these relics basically enhance your monster...
...abilities, and make them stronger
in battles. There is like so much content
in the game, alright?
So, if you wanna help me out...
...okay, and support me
and the channel, I'd really appreciate it
by y'know, clicking the link in the description
and...
...download the game for yourself, okay?
It would really help me out.
