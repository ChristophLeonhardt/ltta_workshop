Whoopi Goldberg implies that Don Junior's son may have tendencies to abuse women Don Jr did an interview with Daily Mail TV and he said that he is more concerned about his sons than his daughters given the current political climate and accusations of sexual assault I got boys and I got girls and when I see what's going on right now it's scary for all things I mean I wouldn't want to are you scared most for your sons and a daughter I mean right now I'd say my son's Whoopi Goldberg claimed that the only reason Don Jr is worried about his son's more than his daughters given all this mean to stuff is because his sons may have a tendency to abuse women you only worry about this for your child if you think your child has these tendencies if your child is not someone who's assaulting people mm-hmm it shouldn't be a concern early though right I mean it shouldn't be a concern right given all of these false sexual misconduct and assault allegations I mean this is just a strange twisted perspective of what Don Jr said I don't really understand how someone could take it that far out of context but I mean this is what we are dealing with with the left right now they just take anything they can and they somehow I don't even know how they managed to twist things around to do something like this like I said in another video there is something called the Innocence Project which takes a DNA evidence and exonerates people from crimes that they didn't commit and the number one crime that they'd exonerate for the most popular one is sexual misconduct and rape so there are a lot of false rape accusations and it really damages men and their reputation and their life they can get sent to prison on Twitter it really blew up one Twitter user said she sure didn't talk about Obama's kids oh yeah they were off-limits Whoopi has lost her dreadlock mind I used to like Whoopi know or one more off my list Sebastien Gorka said proof will be goldberg is unhinged what if a conservative had said Barack Obama's girls will grow up to be abusers and asked for a response from ABC and the view and then Don jr. has something to say Whoopi Goldberg instead of insinuating that my sons are potential future abusers you might want to explain why you defended actual child rapist Roman Polanski and then he quoted will be Goldberg's comments I'm Roman Polanski that she made in the past I don't believe it was rape rape so this is a really interesting point Don jr. brings up he dug up that Whoopi Goldberg in 2009 said that Roman Polanski was not guilty of rape rape so what exactly does that mean Whoopie what is rape rape and what is not rape rape it's just really crazy that all of Hollywood has backed Roman Polanski and yet they take things like Don Junior's comments about his sons in the future and twist it to make then be the perpetrators of some sort of sexual abuse that didn't even happen but yet they defend Roman Polanski someone that actually did assault a child so what is really going on here is this an example of how things have changed in the past ten years in society or is this simply trumpet derangement syndrome if you want to see more from me and the rest of the rebel team like and subscribe you
