i'm mezrab levan it's August 10th and you're watching battleground hey folks Ezra Levant here I am the rebel commander here at the rebel that is a title I made up for myself because it sounds better than publisher or president what we do every week it used to be everyday but I just couldn't keep the schedule I was traveling too much is every Friday from 12 noon Eastern Time to 1 p.m. we have a live chat I'm coming to you live and as you can see on the right hand side of your computer screen there's rolling comments that's fun but YouTube is invented something called super chat which is if you want your comments to be put in a bright highlighted color or even appended to the top of that box you can chip in a couple of bucks or pounds or pesos or rupees or whatever currency you use and the great part of it is that we actually get a portion of that I think we get 70% of the revenue which is good because YouTube of course has cut off and D monetized most right-wing commentary sites like ours so it's a fun way to get your comment highlighted and it helps our bottom line I enjoy the banter I enjoy the back-and-forth I like the fact that people from all around the world tune in that's of course the nature of the Internet and I can see already that we have comments about our friend Tommy Robinson which doesn't surprise me Tommy's Shino used to be a rebel reporter this spring he went and went independent but in Maine and we can show this dramatic arrest we don't need the sound on we'll just put it up in b-roll now you guys he was arrested outside the County Court in Leeds and of course all he had done was standing outside the court saying giving political commentary on the nationwide crisis of Muslim rape gangs in the UK but for doing so he was arrested you can see here by Noah fewer than seven police and five hours from the moment he was arrested he was packed off to prison from arrest to prosecution to conviction to sentencing to imprisonment in five hours how do you do that well you do that illegally is how as you know Tommy Robinson eventually got a top team of lawyers together and filed an appeal and that appeal was heard in mid-july and on August 1st the Court of Appeal led by the Lord Chief Justice himself throughout Tommy's conviction set him free from prison quash the conviction and it was a blistering decision that pointed out how every step of the way the law was broken against Tommy well that's no help to him show the footage of him coming out of prison look how thin he was and I tell you that because of course he was first put in prison in Her Majesty's Prison Holloway champio which Tommy said was really the the best prison for him of course prisons are full of criminals but in how he was not under threat for his life but look at him here look at him being released from HMP only 40 pounds thinner his pants are falling down he's God you can see how emaciated he looks why was he so thin well because he was in solitary confinement his pain he's lifting his pants up he he was in solitary confinement and so he couldn't join the rest of the prisoners is when they go to lunch they have their tray and they go down and someone you know scoops of some mashed potatoes or whatever on their plate Tommy couldn't do that if he could do that at least he could see the food was coming from the same Bowl as the other prisoners were getting but he was in solitary confinement so a special meal was put together with the name Tommy Robinson on him and of course who works in the prison kitchens well that is the prisoners who worked in prison kitchens including obviously dominated by the folks who dominated that prison the Muslim gangs in prison and so on his very first day there in Onley the prisoners would say oh hey Tommy how's your food implying that it is in some way poisoned you know whether it was just spit at the very least or something worse or actual poison or ground up glass who knows Tommy immediately complained to the prison can we get an image of his letters of complaints Tommy hand wrote letters to the prison warden they called them a governor there and he any explained that he did not and could not he couldn't even drink drinks that were not in sealed containers he had nothing to eat and nothing to drink it was almost like an actual hunger strike but it wasn't on purpose Tommy did not want to go on a hunger strike he was on a form of a hunger strain wasn't a strike he was just didn't want to be poisoned either by liquid or by solid so in prison they're allowed to spend a little bit of money but he had to save that money to make phone calls to his wife at 60 pence a call and the rest of his budget he could buy one tin of tuna a day because that was the only thing that was not tampered with right a sealed can of tuna so Tommy and can you call up the Daily Mail did a story they they analyzed show the story I don't know the story shows these letters so so here's the hold it there for a second revealed handwriting expert claims the ex EDL leader Tommy Robinson's jail complaint forms show he is insecure resentful and has low self-esteem so scroll down a bit show the letter so here's a copy of the letter Tommy handwrite basically saying please milord I'm starving I cannot eat the food made by the prison gangs for fear of being poisoned may I please have permission to buy more of my own food this is the letter of someone who's being physically tortured he is being starved now what is the mail online do do they say oh my god this is true this explains why he looked so gaunt this is shocking why did they why did they reject his offer instead of at his request instead of the scandal that these letters represent what is the Daily Mail do they bring in some graphologist which is a junk science to begin with and say Oh toss what Tommy's really like based on his handwriting and and they so he's insecure yeah he was insecure he was literally physically insecure he was in a prison dominated by Muslim gangs who were threatening to kill him on a daily basis so yeah those that handwriting shows insecurity well then that's pretty accurate isn't it but can you imagine these are letters from a starving prisoner saying please governor that's what the call of prison warden please can I have some food and and instead of saying oh my God why did they starve in the chair well yeah look at how he signs his name he's clearly you know rosetta can you imagine that's what the media does they don't care about human rights of course they don't care about the fact that he was in prison in the first place a citizen journalist that's the worst media in the world I've seen it's far worse than in Canada far worse in the United States and it's not just the state broadcaster over there the BBC it's the private media that was the Daily Mail I showed you just a disgrace all right it's 12:08 I've been rambling let me ask have I missed any I have not seen out of the corner of my eye any super chats none have come through okay so I'm gonna keep a lookout on the corner of my eye for those super chats I'm just gonna read some regular comments anyways it G says call Trump he will fix it well I would say two things about that can we call up John Trump Jr's tweet about Tommy I was a try Donald Trump jr. who I think sometimes channels his father or as a channel to his father tweeted about Tommy I think he said this is reason 1776 why were free or something it was a reference to - Tommy Robinson so I know that Tommy's case is at least on the radar of the Trump in a circle his son and I know that ambassador sam brownback who's donald trump's religious freedom diplomat brought his concerns about Tommy Robinson to the United Kingdom so those are the two instances we know about that Donald Trump has been alerted to the handling of Tommy I am I think it's quite likely given those two expressions of interest that news of Tommy Robinson's Court of Appeal victory has come back to Donald Trump I don't know if the next piece of news which is that he is being retried on September 4th at Old Bailey in London has got back to trump because I think it is to the point where it's becoming a bit ridiculous where Tommy Robertson truly is being treated as a political prisoner we know that because we know the court of appeals said he was improperly tried convicted sentenced in prison we know that but did you know when I put this in a new video yesterday Tommy Robinson is being compelled to attend a trial again on September 4th and the likelihood of him being convicted is quite high and I don't know what the likelihood of him being sentenced is oh sorry he will certainly be sentenced I don't know what the likelihood of whether or not that sentence is - any prison time I just don't know I see a super chat Ethan verdure BER says oh dami Tommy Robinson that's the Tommy Robinson chant it's a great chance I had that as my ringtone while he was in prison I thought that was a good good thing to do and the chance is good and Tommy has a lot of fans but the decision is being made in the courts and they are impervious generally to political pressure I think it would be appropriate for the United States to grant asylum - Tommy Robinson as a political prisoner he was a prisoner of conscience you know I want to tell you a fact about Tommy he was arrested in prison so he was in prison already how do you be arrested in prison he was arrested in the prison for criticizing Islam that's that's some news for you I was talking to Tommy in fact it's just today he told me he was in prison in solitary confinement and he criticized Islam and he was arrested in the prison did you know that that's insane when people say the prisons run by the prison gangs they literally mean it they literally mean it it's a Sharia law prison that's a fact that's a fact actually you know I've been talking to Tommy every day and I don't sell tell you that to tell you tales out of school but I tell you that because I'm concerned about him I don't know if you saw my video yesterday it saved Tommy Khan I learned from Tommy that he will be compelled to attend court again on September 4th I believe that he will be convicted and I should tell you that Tommy's health is what you think it is you saw him leaving court I can tell you for a fact that he has been to the hospital twice he's on vacation with his family and it's true he is on vacation with his family trying to get away from the pressure trying to get a reconnect to his family who he hadn't seen for two and a half months but it is also true but on his vacation he has attended twice at hospital he is not well why does an amnesty international care about that why don't reporters without borders care about that why doesn't the Daily Mail care about that think about that you get a letter I mean you know letters from prison are our famous thing Martin Luther King very famously wrote a letter I think was from Birmingham jail can you imagine Martin Luther King political prisoner moral conscience civil rights activists in prison and he emanated a letter from that prison I can't remember if he hand wrote it or he typed it can you imagine instead of reading the contents of that letter if some fool some quislings state journalist said aha Martin Luther King's in prison what's his handwriting like are you kidding me are you kidding me you know you're not gonna read the letter itself you you're more interested in his handwriting are you mad yes they are mad there's a madness there Tommy Robinson was starving Tommy Robinson asked for the right to buy more food he didn't even want it for free he just wanted to buy more food and the prison said no no no you can starve he was not given medical care in prison did you know that do you think it's healthy to lose 40 pounds in two and a half months think that's how when you're only 170 pounds going in think that's healthy that's good if he were a Muslim detainee a terrorist oh he'd have a ten million dollar lawsuit against the government and he'd be getting state apologies right now the Daily Mail itself just wants to talk about his handwriting I see blue Mazhar says rumor has a Julian Assange might testify in the US Senate what is your opinion I have mixed opinions on Julian Assange I know for a fact that when he leaked information about the US military during the during its war in Afghanistan and Iraq he leaked things that were of no political consequence but were of military consequence including how the u.s. defeated IEDs I know for a fact Julian Assange leaked information that revealed the identity of American confidential supporters around the world that led to their deaths so I also know that WikiLeaks was set up to hold tyrannical governments to account but for the first many years of its operation it did not do so it did not take on China or Iran or Venezuela or Cuba it took on the United States so I would say that WikiLeaks has a very checkered past however I would be blind if I didn't notice that they also helped reveal the deep state in the United States that was trying to frustrate the Democratic will of the 2016 election and so while I believe that Julian Assange and WikiLeaks have done many odious things I also acknowledge that they have illuminated the deep state in the United States in an incontrovertible way and that is valuable I don't know what he will testify about in the Senate if he actually attends I think there's another Super chat barb else has gave to tell me yesterday please everyone join us thanks barb when I spoke to Tommy I spoke to his lawyers briefly as well I realized we have to go in on the round after the July 18th court of appeal and the ruling of which was released on August 1st I thought that perhaps it would be discretionary as in the Attorney General could decide whether or whether or not to try Tommy again and I see that in fact it was not discretionary it was a compulsion it is a requirement that Tommy be prosecuted again in the United States that would probably be called double jeopardy they'll just keep trying until they convict him the fact that he served two and a half months in prison wrongly maybe we hear about wrongful convictions all the time and typically they're met with an enormous compensation or at least an apology neither that was the case here don't you think it's outrageous that Tommy would be tried again for the same events in Leeds and he will likely be convicted again and may be sentenced again well he will have a sentence whether or not some prison don't you find that outrageous don't you find that unwritten I want to read some more comments it's 1217 feel free to make your comments I know that I'll see them if you put them in mm a super sad red color otherwise I'll just go through and try and pick the ones so that I can see quickly here's one Lisa is happy to be saying says I can't stand alex jones but it's bullcrap that he is being silenced I was talking to my friend David Menzies today and he compared Alex Jones to go into a World Wrestling Federation event and I thought that's right because it's entertaining but it's sort of a stick also and I think a lot of people who watch wrestling know it's sort of an entertainment more than a 100 percent legit sport but they watch it anyways for the entertainment and my take on Alex Jones is that he's entertaining he's over-the-top but there's also a grain of ideology underneath it he's a dissident he's a government skeptic he believes in personal freedom he's against globalism I think he is a universal skeptic he's skeptical about everything and he indulges skepticism about things that others don't even question so sometimes that's dead right and other times he's skeptical things about which no skepticism is necessary and thus he would come across as someone who indulges conspiracy theories but is a conspiracy theory not just another way of saying an alternative hypothesis or a or a theory that needs to be proved true or false for example when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and Susan Rice and the rest of the Obama Liars said the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi Libya was simply a grassroots spontaneous reaction to an online video put on YouTube by some filmmaker in California that was their line and they were sticking to it and boy they ran on that hard it would have been called a conspiracy theory to dispute that it would be a conspiracy theory to say no no that's not true that was actually an al-qaeda attack the attack happened to be on the anniversary of 9/11 which shows that symbolism and don't believe the government they're lying to you now that could be called a conspiracy theory and it was until the theory was proven to be a fact ranger Jesse motivation says it seems like the left controls the internet but why do they get to control the internet why not the conservatives well there's an irony there because I think the internet obviously not only I'm the internet used to be called the DARPA net did you know that DARPA if I recall correctly its event Defense Advanced Research Projects administration if I'm remembering the acronym it's a military thing of course it was to be a hardened form of communication that was impervious to attack because it was distributed so like a TV station or a newspaper can be taken out by blowing up a printing press or blowing up a TV antenna the whole idea behind dart Pinet was the it's a network so you can't shut it down because it just will work for the rest of the network it's a brilliant idea and it was then widened universities then joined the DARPA and it was renamed the internet no Al Gore did not invent it and became popular obviously in the 90s and now it's just ubiquitous my point is it was invented not only by non leftists it was invented by patriotic male pterri minded Americans and the kind of person what they look like sound like feel like they were left brain science technology in engineering types computer science types who were sort of the opposite of social justice warriors and yes Ori to be ethnically stereotyping but they were white guys and Asian guys and Jewish guys I mean if you look at the Google bosses Sergey Brin I can't remember his colleague Russian Jews who are good at math and chess and stuff like that Zuckerberg himself an autistic white guy Jewish math whiz I don't think they are they are naturally liberal if they had politics at all they would be I think very Objectivist they would be probably libertarian they would probably be like not those aren't feeling easy guys you know if here's someone who sits down and does a whole bunch of internet coding if you're building algorithms you're probably not someone who talks a lot about your feelings you're probably someone who talks about math and numbers which suggests to me that you're naturally conservative and opposed to the social justice warriors business but that was the first wave of the Internet the second wave was the colonization of these companies by liberals who said hey you autistic nerdy math whizzes you are socially awkward and inapt will provide you with what you don't know how to do which is to be citizens and communicators and PR people and political lobbyists and so the math nerds two things after them first of all they said yeah we need some social skills people and the second thing is they got rich and you know what happens when almost anyone gets so rich spectacularly rich they become you know some of them maintain their hardscrabble conservative approach but others say well I'm a limousine liberal now or I want to buy class I have money I have success but the one thing I don't have is class and I know I can get class by being a liberal I'll start drinking wine instead of beer I'll start going to the Opera instead of rock concerts and I want to fit in with the cool kids that is my thesis of what has happened to Silicon Valley California itself used to be the tech place it was where the aerospace industry was it was the military industry was when the engineers were and it still sort of is but now I mean San Francisco itself so the Silicon Valley it's really just a suburb of San Francisco the most left-wing city in North America that's what happened that's my theory Frasor McBurnie Ezra will you be going to cover Tommy's trial of so booked your ticket now and save money thank you that is excellent advice and I I will take it thank you for that advice I will be going there I will be going there on September 4th and I think it will be the worst of all the Tommy events I cover when I covered the appeal it was very technical and try and it was just lawyers talking Tommy was there by video connection but he was not he actually said not a word through the whole procedure there was no evidence given it was just lawyers making philosophical arguments based on the record that was already in the hands of the judge when I went back there on August 1st it was a very brief issuance of the judgment by the Court of Appeal in fact they didn't even read it out they just sort of handed it out but this one on September 4th if I understand it correctly will be a trial de novo which is a Latin way of saying from fresh from new from scratch and can you believe it the entire matter of leads and Tommy's alleged contempt will be canvassed again from scratch by a new judge so a new judge will hear whether or not Tommy Robert in contempt of Leeds we're doing the whole thing over again and it's as if the last two and a half months of his cruel and unusual treatment never even happened I'm looking for more comments as 12:25 feel free to join in you know how we do it you can write your comments on the side if you want it colored in bright highlight you can chip in a few bucks pounds of pesos I mean and the good thing about that is that the rebel gets a cut of that okay let me go through some more comments here Lisa is happy to be seen I'd give Tommy a place to live in America and fatback yes I was thinking about that I mean I've I've had breakfast with Tommy you know when I when I when Tommy worked with us I used to fly and meet him about I don't know once every month or two I don't remember how often but I would get off the plane in Heathrow I would it's a night flight like I would fly overnight from Toronto it's a terrible flight I mean it's terrible and I would land and I was like an hour in customs and I was just ragged and then I would hop in a cab and I would drive up to Luton that's an hour plus so I'd meet Tommy and I was I just wanted a nap and I hadn't had a shower since I left Toronto and I was a mess but it would be the morning there right so we would meet for breakfast and you know those British breakfast it's quite something they have like seven different types of sausage and they are black and it's just like little black biscuity sausage and and they have beans and of course they have eggs and toast and they have so many weird things that we North Americans don't even want to understand and they call it the full English or something the full English breakfast and it was quite something that behold Tommy Robinson having the full English breakfast the lad liked to eat and he was also very sporty right I mean he loved the box he was teaching his son out of box like he's physically very fit Tommy loved to eat so for him to go really on a starvation diet is shocking I think he will fatten up I mean I know Tommy he likes to eat I mean he's not fat at all in fact he was very fit in his arms that's what shocked me when I saw him come out of prison and then of course I met him that day his arms you know I'm not scared of Tommy but I'm just saying they were they were serious arms like they were muscular and of course they're just totally covered with tats so it's you know and so it means a physical guy he's not tall but he's like you know you wouldn't let you wouldn't want to fight him and I mean to see him come out of prison two and a half months later just shrunk was shocking to see partly because I mean he wasn't fat to go in but he was fit and muscular and and he was there you know and then to see him come out afterwards his arms looked thin his face and his eyes look sunken he did not look good but yeah I think he's gonna fatten up I see some super Jets coming in let me let me catch up on those sorry they were I see them out of the corner of my eye um Brian core Suleman $10 thanks very much Alex has evolved his image with the rise of the Internet to grab as much attention as possible but he was breaking news 18 years ago finally payback for exposing Bohemian Grove and WTO protests you know I did a show about Alex Jones the other day and I showed Bohemian Grove I mean let me take him in on that I see there's some other super chests I see Keith McIntosh I see you there and there was one more that I saw and I'll come back to I promise I'll get back to it but let me just talk about Alex Jones and Bohemian Grove I had not really heard of that but Bohemian Grove is a place Grove it's like a it's like a campground it's a pretty big it's in California and it's been the site of an annual retreat for for more than a century I think it's sort of like Burning Man or what are those other super gross Desert Carnival festival things that every goes it's just really really gross Burning Man is close enough so this is like Burning Man but booze instead of drugs and all guys know girls and average age is probably 70 presidents they tilt Republican believe it or not and international bankers and business tycoons Stephen Harper went once did you know and so like it's an annual week-long like Lollapalooza for right-wingers lots of booze hanging out and so you know it's it would be like the Bilderbergers but instead of meeting in a hotel called Bilderberg they're there they're in this Bohemian Grove what does Bohemia means sort of free and let your hair down and and Bill Clinton once joked it's where Republicans go and just hang out all naked I don't know if that's the case but I know can we call up the VIS can we call up some b-roll we don't need this actually get the sound on the to when he shows the the burning of dull care we played it on the show the other day if you just go to Bohemian you can find it in one second on YouTube Alex Jones Bohemian Grove and I want to show there's this pagan ritual where they make this effigy and then they burn it with these incantations that I don't know if they're diabolical but they certainly strike me as pagan it's a 90-minute documentary by Alex Jones I think it came out in the year 2000 and 2001 and he sneaked in to Bohemian Grove he sneaked in with a camera to this elite society you know you hear about all these secret societies the Illuminati the Bilderbergers the trilateral mission this is the kind of conspiracy stuff that Alex Jones talks about right and there's a temptation to say well that's crazy that's kooky bouquet throw the sound up I'll be quiet put the sound up here you have the boatman his face ended up like a skull bringing the bound body across the water again we'll have enhanced video of this later and let's see if you can pick up all the different occultic meanings in the speeches you're about to hear to where they actually burn the cozy effigy yeah thus buried and the shadowy carry with us they'll against some help within this which Hillary have brought from regions where Iranians and priests watch it but I tell you that's a real thing that he sneaked in there doh Bohemian Grove and that that pagan ceremony goes on you can you can find it easy to just google Bohemian Grove Alex Jones you can see that was from the info war site it goes on I'd you know it's it's weird Alex Jones calls that occult would you agree with that burning this priest that that's medieval style biblical style language waiteth you know whatever I I don't quite get it the burning dull care and which I think they mean people who were worried about worldly things and I don't quite get it but would you agree with me that this is the stuff of alex jones as conspiracy theories and at least in that one case of the Bohemian Grove he was dead to rights he didn't just see it he recorded it and I think that's the only recording of any substance that has ever been secretive out of of the Bohemian Grove so I didn't I didn't know about that journalism by Alex Jones until it's a couple years ago would you would you say that's impressive sneaking into the Bohemian Grove where there's literally presidents and generals and bank CEOs sneaking in with a camera uninvited and filming the burning of dull care and that whole weird effigy thing and would you not say that's that's bloody interesting journalism and would you not say that had you actually experienced that you so imagine the experience of sneaking in you're scared you're gonna be outed you're on a mission to get the facts imagine who you see maybe you don't know everyone how would you know who's the president of this company who's the leader of this foreign nation you probably don't even know most the people you see do you doubt the VAT would shape your thinking about the hidden hand and hidden agendas and conspiracies do you doubt that having gone in to the Bohemian Grove 20 odd years ago that you would then be resistant to people saying shut up that's not true shut up you're exaggerating like if you had sneaked into the Bohemian Grove filmed what he filmed and mean the first person ever to reveal it you can imagine that that would make a guy think well I know there's conspiracies out there because I actually broke a 100 year old conspiracy that really was the fancy people meaning you got to give him that I think he's become an all-purpose omnibus skeptic dissident because of that and I think that's okay I think that's okay so thanks for letting me show you some of the Bohemian Grove footage you really should watch it isn't funny how his voice is sort of changed over the years he's become more Alex Jonesy more gravelly but that was his voice back then alright there's some super chats I'm gonna catch up on thanks for letting me show you that I found that very interesting the first time I saw it and I tried to understand what was going on there Keith McIntosh 100 Mexican pesos comments on faith coldly for mayor of Toronto sure I mean as you know faith golde I met her when she was at the Sun News Network and she joined us at the rebel yes two years ago and she was our star journalists no doubt about it did some of our best work investigative work she traveled with us around the world from India to she came with me to Iraq last summer and I don't want to get into the details of her exit because we've covered that before and I have a video to that effect but basically a year ago she went contrary to my wishes to the Charlottesville oh right gathering and I said to her don't go to that even if you just go neutrally it'll be misconstrued by your haters so they'll conflate you with them but she went and you know I wasn't thrilled with that but when it was later revealed that she had gone on a neo-nazi podcasts affiliated with the Daily stormer which is named after Hitler's der stürmer and conceal that from me and talked with them for an extended period of time without indicating her disagreement or displeasure or disapproval of their Nazism but rather saying things like I salute you I there was just too much there's too much and she brought that to my attention and said look someone's going to report this in tomorrow's newspapers she showed me the email from a reporter she said I I know I have to resign and I said no I have to fire you and so we did and we had a staff meeting and she said a tearful goodbye to everyone there was you know there was lots of hugs all around and and I did a short video saying it was just too far and that's that so you know we we love faith she's a great journalist great all these things but she just did a really bad mistake and we have spoken to her once or twice since then but I don't think that she I think she's chosen a different path so it's awkward for us to cover her because she left us over a fundamental and material editorial difference that doesn't touch upon her candidacy for mayor I've seen her videos and I've read her website and I agree with the points in her website sure I do because she's not talking about the subject matter over which we disagreed which was her appearance on a neo-nazi radio show by the way I think it's there are ways to go on a neo-nazi web show radio KKK whatever there are permissible I think it's important though to indicate a separation between you and I would if there was a reason I would go on a Nazi show to speak back to them to debate with them to point out there I mean I feel no need to do so I feel no need to justify or legitimize them with that I don't feel the need to try to convert someone or save someone but there are ways to do it but those ways were not done and that was the source of our great disagreement which has been a source more of sorrow than anger for me because she was such a great journalist and frankly I think she made the wrong decision I don't think I'm rehashing personal things here I think all most of these things are in the public domain but so it makes it difficult for us to cover faith because I don't want to cover her in a way that seems like an endorsement of her and at this point I think because she is a marginal candidate speaking statistically I don't think that her candidacy yet has the momentum or the gravity to be a serious contender now that may change that may change but I note that for the first week or so she did and that website didn't have a campaign manager I don't even think she has one now I don't know she's got a website up but I think it's really a Twitter campaign I think it's just sort of an online campaign which is a fun media activity but of course my guess is that maybe 10% of her Twitter followers are in Toronto so it's it's a Twitter campaign doesn't really work when you're running in one geographical location like the city its royal so I think to be very candid and I would say this to her if we were talking here having a success on Twitter is very different from getting votes in a particular municipal City I remember when my friend Stephen LeDrew who I liked very much he used to be the president of the Liberal Party of Canada he was very popular media feature in Toronto in a last minute ish kind of way he threw his hat in the ring for Mayor of Toronto a few years back and it felt similar it was sort of a media PR thing and Stephen was very affable very likeable everyone liked him but he didn't have a website he didn't really have a team and and he got I think he was in the single digits and it it was a fun media shtick but it just wasn't didn't have the boots on the ground and that's my assessment of freights campaign I think that the issue she's running on are legit I generally would agree with the policies he's outlined on her platform but it is my assessment that the campaign itself is not a serious political activity it is a Twitter campaign it's fun it's PR and buzzy but I don't think it's got any legs now I could be wrong if I saw a poll showing that she was out of the single digits and that she had some penetration into the mind of Torontonians and that she was being considered I think that to cover her in that instance would be legit because she's a contender and if you're a contender you kind of there's got to be a dozen people running for mayor in Toronto we're not covering we're not doing a lot of coverage of the race at all really but it we wouldn't cover any other candidate who was going to get one or two percent we just wouldn't and to cover faith when she's only in the 1 or 2 percent range which is my guess of what it's going to be would be something we would do for you know a rebel staffer but we left her in an unhappy way I mean I still regard myself as a friend with her even though I'm not friendly I've talked to her more than a couple times in the last year so there you go that's me being very candid I think she made a big mistake in a year ago and I think at the time she knew it but she sort of glossed that over and re rewritten that narrative I don't think it's a serious campaign for mayor if that changes I think we'll cover it if faith golde becomes a legitimate challenger for the position of mayor in Toronto that would be an interesting story that we would cover and we would probably indicate in some way that she was a former staffer that we said goodbye to you know for cause but we would cover it as a legit news story I just have to say it doesn't feel like a legit news story yet because I just don't believe that there's any traction show me a poll to the contrary and I'll change my mind but right now if the vote were held today I think she would be like get a couple percent I just don't think there's any penetration into the mind of the electorate there you go you know if I'm happy to take a contrary point of view let me see if I've missed any here we go Tommy was malnourished in prison says savvy dude one needs IV minerals Myers push from a naturopath I have not given Tommy a prescription I know he's been to the hospital twice you know he's a grown man and he's got a wife and he's got he's talked to at least two doctors and hopefully he's getting yeah hopefully he's getting fattened up and not just fattened up obviously hopefully it's getting them the minerals and vitamins and other things too to get there and of course there's a psychological aspect to I think there's a couple more super chests let me look at them i'm and and get those give me one second I'll find those you guys it's just a second here of so many emails coming through because we sent out some emails about a save Tommy petition by the way we're actually petitioning petitioning the Attorney General asking him not to proceed with the rehearing against Tommy so he sent up a petition I'm a I'm just trying to find it here oh here we go Alan Scantlin chips in five bucks thank you very much and says can this government silence led by Trudeau and Freeland on Tommy Robinson the political prisoner is deafening oh yeah I mean don't expect Justin Trudeau or Christopher Elin there any Canadian liberal to speak out for Tommy and frankly don't expect any conservative to either they're very cowardly when it comes to issues like this because Tommy is largely about Islam and Andrew Shearer is terrified of that just terrified look at the censorship he's put one of his MPs and when there's a Senators to in the last 48 hours a senator batters and an MP named Culkin have both been pressured by Andrew Shue to delete tweets they made about Saudi Arabia so yeah don't expect to Andrew Shearer you can add that issue to your list of Trudeau in Freeland Nigel Tipton two pounds that Tommy has PTSD clear to see caused by injustice yeah you're right and that's not just a political opinion that's a medical opinion Tommy was diagnosed with PTSD after his last horrific prison experience because remember he's forced to be in solitary not because the judges actually order that on him but rather because if you start in solitary confinement he'll be killed by Muslim prison gangs so you're not meant to be in solitary confinement for months and months and months of the time it's only a tremendously acute punishment to someone but Tommy was put in there for his safety you know and regularly screamed threats of violence at them I mean you can't you can't do that let alone being removed from any social interactions for months let me go and get some more comments Pete Kingston will the rebel receive a gold play button for YouTube from YouTube for 1 million subscribed for subscription soon what an achievement congratulations never stop thank you very much Pete I haven't checked our subscription count in a few days but I think it's coming close to a million isn't it I think we're around nine hundred ninety thousand I think I think we were nine hundred ninety thousand earlier this week so we'll probably be there maybe even next week so we would we would qualify for that million play button thank you for that mmm Tony naggy says Ezra do you think Tommy will go back to jail be banned from social media I don't think it's likely that the court will ban Tommy from social media although I shouldn't say that because he could be ordered to be banned yeah that could be he could face an order to that effect he could yeah actually the more I think about it I don't know if that'll happen I would be surprised that they sent him back it's a prison but I shouldn't even say that anymore that wouldn't be surprising why would that be surprising why would in fact it maybe would be surprising if it was otherwise I really don't know the law of contempt is so obscured the fact that Tommy was imprisoned at all is surprising and shocking you've heard me say it before no British journalist has been imprisoned for contempt of court since the 1940s so you would have thought that Tommy would not be imprisoned but in fact he was sentenced to 13 months in prison so all predictions are sort of out the window aren't they any any precedent is out the window you should go to my video at save Tommy calm I take you through the leading case a lawyer named West was very abusive you know to a judge it was shocking this conduct in in court he got a few hundred pounds fine so that's the leading case in the UK and they go from being fine a few hundred pounds you know called a thousand bucks to 13 months in prison is so disproportionate so yeah and any predictions about Tommy you just can't even you just can't even make those Kendra Oppenheim you don't think that when the violence reaches such a state that lefties can't leave their house it won't happen I don't mean I missed the first part of that conversation mmm John Smith time to end our governments they are the problem well of course you may I think that our democratic liberal society is the best form of government you may mean switching the party in charge I hope that's what you mean Jimmy's 49 Michelle Rempel seems like a beast does she have potential well sometimes she shows courage but I think she's very leery talking about Islam at all I don't think that you've seen any conservative Andrew shear or Michelle Rempel take one of two objections number one to the actual number of immigrants to Canada and number two to the Islamic character of immigration or to have some sort of vetting to keep the Islamists out but let in only progressive liberal Muslims that is something that Andrew Shearer and Michelle Rempel are very afraid of mmm Keith McIntosh your monologue on Victoria's statue scandal was among your best work I've seen office beats me well that's very generous it's a thousand Mexican pesos I don't know what that is in Canadian currency but I bet you could buy a pizza for for a thousand Mexican pesos thank you very much that's extremely generous if you appreciate that that's that's that super chat I worked there and it's very very nice of you and you know Friday's usually is our are sort of we have a bit of a barbecue here at the office and sometimes we bring in pizza it's a good idea thank you for that I'm just scrolling back through here st. Jean d'Arc Ezra report on the New Brunswick shooting I've been glancing at the news and I've been so busy I haven't had it I understand they have the suspect which tells me they have the name but at least the last I looked the name had not been published so I have not been that attentive to it I've been so busy on on things today I presume we'll get that information later today but you never know they kept the identity of faisal has seen the murderer at the Toronto Danforth shooting secret as long as they could if they keep this name secret for a long time I think we can assume they're trying to put together an official narrative as they did for faisal has saying that no no no no no he's not a terrorist even though Isis said he was one of theirs all right I'm just scrolling through piano lady that was depressing Ezra should have stuck with faith Goulding I'm gonna disagree with you I just I I mean I like faith very much I would say I mean I like everyone who works with us but she was my favorite reporter I think I probably told her that beautiful brilliant energetic strong courageous willing to travel great team player what's not to like but you just can't go on a neo-nazi show and for 20 minutes and say things like I salute you and God bless you and you're doing God's work or whatever she just can't do that without indicating that there's a line between you sorry I think that stinger still and you got to pull that stinger out I'm just its 1256 we have time for a few more comments a leak line what happened to the Israel and Palestine talk Israel accidentally fired and then we'll see what happened is there any way they'll talk I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean but I know over the last few days there have been dozens of rockets fired indiscriminately from Hamas Terrace and Gaza into civilian populations in the nearby town including steriod I was actually in stare out earlier this year Christie thanks from the UK as when you're going to be in a youtube millionaire you know what's so funny about that is you're right we're gonna have a million YouTube subscribers if only that meant a million bucks you know we were on track to do very well by YouTube did in 2016 we were actually on track our whole company together there was about thirty of us working at the time where we were on track to make a million bucks but then YouTube demonetised conservative sites by about 90 percent Joe John Smith they want to kill Tommy so they don't care about his PTSD oh you're right you know I'm not sure if I told you this but um on three occasions Tommy was in lockdown in this cell to protect him on three occasions the jailers accidentally forgot to lock his doors so any Muslim prison gang who walked by could have come in and killed him Oh an accident sure Amanda joy says I'm signing Tommy's petition now yeah let me say that one last time I don't know if you know this but on July 18th I actually met Jeffrey Cox the new Attorney General by chance he was at court being sworn in I I sat and watched it was quite a nice ceremony and afterwards I went right up to him and I shook his hand I said congratulations and then I asked him what Tommy Robinson and he said and I believed him that he was not briefed on the matter he had been so busy preparing to beam Attorney General okay so now he said a chance to get briefed on the subject and so if you go to save Tommy calm we have a petition that we will personally deliver to the office of the Attorney General demanding that they stop the persecution of him so um if you want to chip in to Tommy's legal bills feel free unfortunately we've got a court one more time and you could also sign this petition and we will deliver that to the Attorney General maybe Tommy himself will deliver it or maybe we will I don't know Andrew down send says they want to kill Tommy and he put they and Tommy in those triple parenthesis that is internet shorthand for Jews I think you're you're weirdly wrong they're the people in prison who were threatening Tommy's life are not Jewish they're Muslim and Tommy I don't think he's particularly religious at all but he's obviously Christian so that's just sort of weird that you say both the killers and Tommy there would be killers in Tommy you're Jewish that just doesn't even make any sense you got to be smarter on that stuff guys say it's one o'clock sorry I was sort of look I was trying to make say sometimes the comments when I was reading them they're they refer to other comments so I I was sort of reading them in real time we covered a lot of comments we covered some heavy talk about faith look I like I like faith enough not to like he's very likable she's very agreeable I think that was the problem though she went down there to Charlottesville and was too agreeable with bad people or with people who had views that she needed to distance herself from and I think she's paying the price for that politically now I think if faith had come back and drawn a bright line between her and the daily stormer then she wouldn't be suffering the marginalization she is right now I mean she's been kicked off patreon kicked off PayPal she's being demonized by the mainstream media and I think it's because she just would not draw that bright line and that's a shame because I don't think that's her I was with her in Israel I think she's a turbo Zionist I think she's a Philo semi - Jew lover I don't think she's a neo-nazi and that's why it puzzles me that she wouldn't pull the Stinger out and that she went on there I think she was too agreeable to them but that's her life and you know we will we will report on her campaign if it's a real campaign and I am open to be convinced of that but so far it's just a Twitter campaign and and especially given the challenges and how we say goodbye to where I just don't think it's something we're going to cover I hope you accept my answer to that because that's honest and I hope I wasn't too dishing about internal stuff but it's something that people ask us about it's absolutely true she was if not my favorite one of my favorite people we've ever worked with you at the rebel Tommy's so we've had a lot of handfuls haven't we but a lot of colorful characters passed through the doors here at the rebel in our three and a half years oh well they were called the rebel we're not called the establishment highway it's 101 we've been doing this friend oh this one that super Chad let me just let me read that Oh Pete Henderson chipped in 10 bucks thanks very much for that Pete we're gonna wrap up today I do this every Friday so if I didn't get around to your question please come back on Friday next week until oh hey I got a show tonight at 8:00 p.m. eastern time if you want to watch
