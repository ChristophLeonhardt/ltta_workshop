>> Neil: ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
WHAT THE NORTH KOREANS DO?
WE HAVE A SENSE FROM KIM
JONG UN THAT AT LEAST HIS
UPCOMING CHAT WITH SOUTH
KOREAN COUNTERPART IS ALL
FOR THE TIME BEING.
IS IT ONLY FOR THE TIME
BEING?
IF THAT'S OFF BIG MEETING
BETWEEN KIM JONG UN AND THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OFF AS WELL IN
SINGAPORE LESS THAN A MONTH
FROM NOW?
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD
SAY, MAYBE SHOULD NOT SAY
FROM THE FORMER WHITE HOUSE
DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF THAT'S
KARL ROVE.
CARL, THIS SORT OF CAME OUT
OF NOWHERE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING
MAYBE IT'S JUST THE COLD
FEET NORTH KOREAN, YOU KNOW,
COUNTER TO ALL OF WHAT HAS
BEEN GOING ON.
OR THAT SOMETHING MORE
INVOLVED COULD BE AFOOT
HERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
>> I WOULD IGNORE IT KIM
JONG UN IS PROBABLY PROBING,
SEEING IF HE CAN GET A
RESPONSE.
CAN HE BY RATTLING HIS CAGE
CAUSE THE UNITED STATES AND
SOUTH KOREA TO FORESWEAR
THEIR TRAINING PROGRAM,
MILITARY EXERCISES?
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATIONS
WOULD BE SMART TO JUST
IGNORE IT AND PLOW ON.
LET THE ONUS BE ON HIM.
HE KNEW THESE EXERCISES WERE
COMING.
THEY EARLIER SAID THEY
DIDN'T OBJECT TO THEM IN
THEIR CURRENT FORM.
AND HE IS ACTING OUT TO SEE
IF CAN HE GET A RESPONSE.
DON'T GIVE HIM ONE.
>> Neil: I'M TOLD HE WAS
GIVEN A HEADS UP.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TRUE THAT
IS.
IT IS WHAT IT IS.
I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS AN
ACTIVE IMPULSIVENESS HERE
THIS PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
DEEMED SIMILARLY IMPULSIVE.
WORKED TO ADVANTAGE GETTING
THESE TALKS WHERE THEY ARE.
THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER ALL
OF A SUDDEN MAY BE FEELING A
LITTLE OVERWHELMED HERE.
AND THE PRESSURE ON THE
WORLD STAGE AT THIS BIG POW
ABOUT NOW SINGAPORE.
LOOKS LIKE IS HE GIVING AWAY
MUCH OF THE STORE AHEAD OF
EITHER OF THEM SITTING DOWN.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
>> LET'S NOT UNDER ESTIMATE
THIS IS A SMART ACTOR.
REMEMBER, HE TAKES POWER A
MONTH BEFORE 27TH BIRTHDAY
CONSOLIDATED POWER AND BEEN
MADE -- MADE THE SUPREME
LEADER IN DECEMBER.
HE BECOMES THE FIRST
SECRETARY OF THE WORKERS
PARTY IN APRIL.
HE HAS CONSOLIDATED POWER.
IS HE RUTHLESS.
HE HAS KILLED HIS
HALF-BROTHER.
HE HAS KILLED HIS UNCLE.
HE HAS KILLED HIS UNCLE'S
FAMILY.
HE HAS KILLED ASSOCIATES OF
HIS UNCLE ALL OF WHOM HE
THOUGHT WERE THREATS TO HIM.
THIS IS A METHODICAL
DELIBERATE.
RUTHLESS DICTATOR.
SMART GUY, TUTORED BY HIS
FATHER AND GRANDFATHERED.
HE HAS THEIR HABITS.
SAID GET RID OF BROKEN
PROMISE.
LAST TIME THEY LITERALLY
SAID WE'LL GIVE UP OUR
PROGRAM AND A MATTER OF DAYS
LATER LAUNCHED AN
INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC
MISSILE THEREBY VIOLATING
THE PLEDGE THAT THEY HAD
JUST GIVEN.
SO, LET'S -- HE HAS AGREED
TO SHOW UP ON THE 129 OF
JUNE IN SINGAPORE.
HE IS ONLY GOING TO SHOW UP
BECAUSE HE IS UNDER A
TERRIFIC SET OF SANCTIONS
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS
PUT IN PLACE THAT BUILD ON
THE SANCTIONS PUT IN PLACE
BY THREE PREVIOUS
PRESIDENTS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS GOTTEN
TO THE POINT BECAUSE OF HIS
PREDECESSORS THAT HE CAN
SANCTION THE PEOPLE WHO WANT
TO DO BUSINESS WHO WANT TO
DO BUSINESS WITH THE PEOPLE
WHO DO BUSINESS WITH NORTH
KOREA.
IT'S THAT TOUGH.
AND SO I JUST PLOW AHEAD.
AND MAKE THE ONUS BE ON HIM
IF HE DECIDES HE IS NOT
GOING TO SHOW UP.
>> Neil: REAL QUICKLY WE ARE
LEARNING, KARL, SWITCHING TO
IRAN THE EUROPEANS ARE GOING
TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO
RESCUE, COBBLE TOGETHER,
SAVE THE DEAL, WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO TALK WITH OR WITHOUT
THE UNITED STATES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
>> WELL, SECRETARY POMPEO
HAS INDICATED AN OPENNESS TO
CONTINUING TO TALK TO THE
EUROPEANS.
FRANKLY, I THINK, AGAIN, IT
WOULD BE SMART FOR THE
ADMINISTRATION TO ALLOW THAT
TO GO FORWARD.
BECAUSE, LOOK, IF WE ARE
GOING TO PUT IN PLACE TOUGH
SANCTIONS ON THE IRANIANS IN
90 DAYS.
WE WOULD RATHER HAVE THE
EUROPEANS WITH US THAN
AGAINST US.
SO IF THE HAS SAID, I THINK
THEY NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR
TO THE EUROPEANS, WE WANT
ANY TIME INSPECTIONS.
WE WANT AN END TO THESE
PROGRAMS NOT A PAUSE IN
THESE PROGRAMS.
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE CAPS.
WE WANT TO HAVE PROHIBITION.
AND IF THE EUROPEANS CAN
PRESSURE THE IRANIANS SO
MUCH THE BETTER FOR US AND
FOR THEM.
>> Neil: YOU KNOW, KARL, YOU
ARE SO GOOD.
ALL OF THIS IS BREAKING NEWS
STUFF THOUGHT WOULD BOUNCE
IT OFF OF YOU.
SEE HOW GOOD THIS GUY IS YOU
