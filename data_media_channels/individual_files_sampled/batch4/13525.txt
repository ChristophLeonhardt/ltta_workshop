Senator Harry Reid is one of the worst Liars ever to grace the national stage he accused 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney of cheating on his taxes without any evidence then celebrated his lies since it helped prevent Romney from becoming president he called George W Bush a liar who betrayed the country he said paying taxes was voluntary which is weird since it's not attacked the Koch brothers his unamerican and admitted he'd rather let a child with cancer suffer than fund the government feet piecemeal his Senate tenure was marked by conflict and cram downs from the Obamacare Fiasco to the destruction of the filibuster both of which by the way will now backfire on Democrats yet there was Reid receiving accolades yesterday for his supposedly grand tenure in the Senate and there he was in the pages of the New York Times lecturing Americans about of all things the supposes scourge of fake news the New York Times tweeted quote much of the responsibility for separating what's real and what's fake will will fall on Democrats writes Harry Reid here are some of Reid's other sterling advice in the New York Times close to Republicans I say recognize the difference between campaigning and governing and between knee-jerk opposition's the accomplishments of the Obama era really Reid spent his entire career opposing Republican policy in knee-jerk fashion and what accomplishments in the Obama era are worth upholding exactly Reid specifically cites Obamacare he says it's a dramatic miss reading of your mandate to destroy it even though Obama never had a clear mandate to pass Obamacare and the public spent the next six years destroying the Democrats from us reading their mandate in passing that monstrosity Reid wrote to Democrats I say it has never been more important to stand up for the things we believe in we are entering a new Gilded Age nobody's gotten richer off government than Reid he spent his entire life in government making about 190,000 bucks a year and now he's worth somewhere between three and ten million dollars the Clintons are wealthy because of political back-scratching too he wrote quote much of the responsibility for separating what is real and what is fake will fall on Democrats again this is nuts Reid is one of the worst liars in the history of the Senate he also wrote quote when Democrats picked their fights next year they can do so knowing that win or lose they will be debating in a Senate that we made more open and more transparent this is Reid defending the idiotic move of nuking the filibuster on cabinet picks its crippled his party going into an era of Republican leadership in the White House in Congress Reid will significantly improve America by leaving the Senate but recounting his legacy well that should remind Americans just why Democrats should not be trusted with power i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show oh so much to get you today here on the bench pho plus we're doing the mailbag today we're broadcasting on Friday obviously because we missed a show earlier in the day but we will be starting to do some Friday shows in the near future we have some surprises planned for that which is why I need to subscribe it daily wire comm but first before we get to today's show we have to say hello to our advertisers over at wink so this is the company that you go to for wine so you don't know anything about wine right you know you don't know what wine to bring your friends house was really expensive you don't know the difference between a Cabernet and Merlot you don't

their stock they produce the lines themselves the lines are really really affordable the Alma staff members have had their wine and given the quality of the podcast you would think they drink the wine all the time but no they usually have it only in their off hours but they they say that the wine is really really good they even had a wine party here that was that was really spectacular apparently and they say the products just great again if you don't know anything about wine but you want an affordable wine to bring over your friend's house and make sure that you don't look like a fool wink is

palate and the line is apparently really really good all of my staffers swear by it which means that either the wines good or they're all alcoholics alrighty so today we begin with the fact the Democrats have really given up the only tool they ever had for being able to hold Republicans in check and and number one they're their biggest tool for holding Republicans in check for a long time was the media they believed the media would be able to stop Republicans from being terrible and vindictive and Republican and now they've blown all credibility and you can see how badly they've blown their credibility over this whole thing they've been discussing about fake news fake news this big news that for those who have missed this controversy Democrats saying now since the election that the reason Donald Trump was is because people believed fake News Now Democrats haven't really distinguished between headlines that are just flat-out not true and messages that they don't like so when Donald Trump says things like radical Islam is something Democrats never say and it's a threat then a lot of people will say that's fake news that's heard Democrats say the word radical Islam right the overall message is true and he was making an overstatement but obviously he didn't mean for it to be taken literally fake news is like pizza gay pizza gate is fake news because there's no evidence that pizza gate is real that there's this this sex slavery ring being run out of this this pizzeria in middle of Washington DC but the Democrats don't bother to make that distinction and they never have in fact they've probably they've actually promulgated fake news and a routine rate as so long as it helps them so that's actually destroyed their capacity to be fact checkers nobody trusts you to check the facts if you're the person who promulgated half the false stories in the first place the same people who complain about fake news are the people who are spending literally months talking about hands up don't you write there's that famous picture from CNN of all of their anchors doing hands up don't shoot and those people on CNN and those same exact people are now complaining about the scourge of fake news that drove Trump to the presidency well at a certain point we stopped listening to them and that was real good for Donald Trump both because it meant that we didn't listen to them when they slandered him and it also meant that we didn't listen to them when they told the truth about him which worked out really well for Donald Trump it means that we're all gonna have to find new sources of information people that you trust to bring you the news my general rule of thumb is I mean aside from the basic rules like everything has to be double sourced my general rules of thumb on news to trust news outlets to trust is do they ever print stories that are not in their own economic self-interest do they ever print stories that don't that run counter to their own narrative do they ever print stories that debunk things that you know that they believe and that's usually a pretty good indicator so I think the Washington Post is better than the New York Times the New York Times have rarely run stories that run counter to kind of their leftist narrative the Washington Post actually does sometimes and and so I think it's a better outlet again that's a quick and dirty rule of thumb you know Breitbart is never gonna run anything that's counter to their interests Infowars doesn't run stuff that's counter to their interests and that's why those sites are less trustworthy and the same thing holds true on the Left I don't trust Huffington because everything they run is is in the interest of their narrative one of the things we try to do a daily wear and this is not you know a this is not patting ourselves on the back although it is is is that we try to have a variety of perspectives so John Nolte who's one of our editors at large he and I disagree on virtually everything with what I did on all Trump we try to make room for that because we want opposing voice voices to be presented any case the mainstream media haven't done this and so they blew all their credibility and here is a perfect example of how they blew all of their credibility here's Brian Williams who faked his own life story multiple times right he was in a helicopter in Iraq he was almost shot down he was watching bodies float by him during Hurricane Katrina he was present at the storming of the beaches at Normandy he was actually on the original mission - mission to the moon and now he's still on MSNBC right they brought him back on MSNBC after he was ousted from NBC Nightly News and here he is - crying fake news as we talked about here last night fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience a BuzzFeed news study of Donald Trump's own tweets where they follow back news stories to their root source found more of them came from Breitbart originally than from any other single source and of course he's ripping on Breitbart his fake news now as a former employee of Breitbart I can say that not everything that Breitbart prints is faking is the vast majority of what Breitbart does is agregate they actually just rewrite other people's stories a lot but again Brian Williams complaining about fake news is rather ironic and what he doesn't know there is look at some of the other sources that the Trump was tweeting during the campaign right some of the other big sources the Washington Post right Fox news.com the hill the New York Post Daily Mail right he even tweeted the Huffington Post a few times right so the idea that a National Review which really didn't like him very much the idea that all of the people who are tweeting were only tweeting from Breitbart obviously that's the biggest circle there and yes I think Breitbart was a trump Pravda outlet but that doesn't mean that every headline that came from Breitbart is fake news nor does it mean the entire outlet can simply be thrown out with the bathwater we actually have to evaluate each story and there are certain reporters at Breitbart who are really quite good I think the Charlie Spearing is a good reporter over at Breitbart I think Aaron Klein / Brent Jerusalem is a very good reporter I think Matt Boyle is not a very good reporter but I think there plenty of good reporters at Breitbart even though it's an outlet that I think is overall just a shilling shilling for Trump but again the left blew all of its credibility here and so when they call when they call foul here when they scream about about fake news it just doesn't resonate I mean Hillary Clinton is doing the same routine now instead of just recognizing you guys lost the election because you ran a bad candidate and she ran an abysmal campaign and he didn't understand what a lot of Americans were complaining about instead you were too busy cutting videos with you know with mary j blige in which she's singing to you questions instead of just recognizing that they're trying to blame some outside source cheating whether it's the Russians cheating or whether it is whether it's fake news here's Hillary Clinton's a crying fake news the epidemic of malicious fake news and false propaganda that flooded social media over the past year it's now clear that so-called fake news can have real-world consequences this isn't about politics or partisanship lives are at risk lives of ordinary people just trying to go about their days to do their jobs contribute to their communities it's a danger be addressed and address quickly bipartisan legislation is making its way through Congress to boost the government's response to foreign propaganda and Silicon Valley is starting to grapple with the challenge and threat of fake news whose gonna determine what's fake news and what's not fake news that's really the biggest question now some stuff yeah I do want to avoid the tendency to say nothing is fake news because the media / label things fake news there are things that are fake news there are things that are fake news here she's saying pizza gate is fake news and that's what drove this guy over to this pizzeria to try and shoot up the problem is the problem is that if you are going to if you are going to you know label everything fake news from pizza gate to to Benghazi right and remember how the media downplayed Benghazi they said there was nothing to see there there certainly was something to see there you know the the fact that they they conflated all of that destroyed their own credibility and so when Hillary Clinton is standing there decrying fake news it's like wait a second why you don't get to do this maya mika brzezinski who's another one of these these you know kind of dicey reporters over on MSNBC she's out morning joe she's she says you know hillary can complain about fake news hillary complains about fake news and then mica this morning she says you know hillary tried to get me thrown off air for simply saying that this was a competitive race i was concerned the campaign was not understanding that perhaps there was an arrogance that needed to get up there i worse and understand that this isn't over i'll just say it NBC got a call from the campaign like I had had done something that was journalistically inappropriate or something and needed to be pulled off the air I mean think about that no that's just that's injure okay and you know the fact that Hillary Clinton is saying fake news this fake news that and then she tried to have a reporter pulled off the arrow supposedly because that reporter was was saying that this was a more competitive race it just demonstrates how silly all of this is hill again Hillary Clinton has no credibility to call out fake news because Hillary Clinton is the propagator of fake news I mean you remember that Hillary Clinton once claimed that her husband's all of the all of these circumstances surrounding her husband and Lewinsky all of it was lies it was all just vast right-wing propaganda the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president okay and so she's been singing the same tune for 30 years Democrats always sing the same team and they lose it must be that somebody lied about us it can't be that somebody told the truth about us the truth is virtually all of the anti Hillary stories were true virtually all the anti Trump stories were true virtually none of the pro Trump or pro Hillary stories were true that was sort of the theme of the campaign as we were pointing it out plus again in Hillary Clinton I say she's the purveyor of lies I mean here's just a few of her whoppers and this was you find these these lies on on YouTube they are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists if fact checkers have said that she was wrong there is no video that Isis is using when she thought there's a pattern now of her claiming that videos exist that do not exist I remember landing under sniper fire there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base her arrival in Bosnia was not quite as dramatic as Clinton put it memory should always match the videotape and family members of the Benghazi victims are saying you lied to them in that hearing we've seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an aweful internet video that we had nothing to do with she told me something entirely different ethic casket ceremony she said it was the cause of the the the video and that she would get back to me okay so that's just an example of some of the lies that Hillary Clinton was telling in their shoes decrying fake news and talking about how terrible it is very difficult to take the Democrats seriously and the media seriously when they've blown their own credibility which means the Trump basically has free reign he basically has run of the place he has run of the place and that's either a good thing or that's a bad thing and we'll talk about that I have to go over to daily water to subscribe because we're gonna talk about whether
