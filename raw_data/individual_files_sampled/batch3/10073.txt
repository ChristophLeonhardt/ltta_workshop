police in Paris have shot and killed a knife attacker who killed one person in the Opera District on Saturday evening four others are injured two of them seriously police are investigating the incident as a terror attack RT France correspondent lukas TOA joined us directly from paris with details the attack happened in this very busy district of Paris it's a touristic place where there are a lot of restaurants lots of bars theatres the attack happened a bit before 9:00 p.m. a moment where all Parisians and tourists were outside so basically people were eating in restaurants having good times with friends a man assault randomly several people with knife according to witnesses the man was walking in the streets crazy stabbing every people he met on his way then he ran towards police officers apparently shooting kill me or I kill you several people heard him saying Allahu Akbar then he has been killed by police officers the metro lines of the area has been closed for now and all the neighbourhood is buckled other people were blocked also in restaurants and bars so it was really a panic scenes there we know that an investigation is now opened by the anti terroristic section in Paris we just heard that Isis Islamic state claimed responsibility for this attack french prosecutors say they are treating the stabbing as a terrorism related incident this is the fifth such attack that has hit France in the last two years the latest incident comes despite French president macron lifting at the state of emergency in the country last October On February a man with a machete attempted to enter the Louvre Museum no one was killed or injured a month later an attempted attack on Orly Airport left one person injured that attacker was shot by the police in April 2017 an Islamist opened fire on police on the Shan say ISIL claimed responsibility and in October the city of Marseille saw a stabbing at a railway station three people died including the attacker in that all right let's now cross live to Jennifer Breeden who is an international criminal law attorney Jennifer thanks for being with us we were just discussing in the break you and I always happen to meet under these circumstances but you're the mind that I want to get into when it comes to situations like this so police are now investigating the attack as a terror case what was your first reaction when you heard the news of this attack there in Paris it was the same thing again I was gonna almost be annoyed I mean we've seen this pattern over and over in European nations I think Paris has actually gotten better where they don't want to jump to conclusions but I mean there's certain things that always point to Isis or the Islamic state as being the perpetrator one of their soldiers so to speak I mean we're talking I their van attacks car tacks purposely running into people or especially knife attacks it's much harder to get your hands on a gun or a firearm so in Europe when their soldiers carry out an attack it's gonna be with a knife attack something very very easy for them to get so it's immediately what I thought it's also one of the buzz places that some of their soldiers have gone in not you know around Europe is is Paris as they've been there even though that French forces and French army has tried to has tried to say that they've you know ramped security and things like that they still have enough Isis Isis followers Isis soldiers plus Isis has changed the ideology they've changed their commands to their followers hey we're losing ground they have lost ground in Syria and in Iraq many other places in terms of their own headquarters so they're now modus operandi is to tell their followers wherever you are whether it's in Europe North America but especially in Europe carry out your attacks where you are and do it there now just before you came on we did a little bit of a rundown of the incidents that have taken place in France the fifth terror attack in that country in the last two years this always begs the question about you know security freedom versus the security of the public is this simply a lack of proper policing or is there something perhaps deeper social issues motivating people to do these sorts of attacks well in in terms of motivation to do these attacks I mean you know they always say and that's kind of been the public outcry is that anybody that's attacking you know Isis and in Syria or Iraq is gonna be part of this of course France has been one of those coalition forces but I mean that's that's no different than some of the things that Russia has done or some of the other nations have done against Isis or terrorist forces in Syria so you know one of the reasons for this if you look at the ideology of Isis which they don't publicize as much it's to completely cleanse the world especially from democratic or secular values and that starts with the West namely Europe North America the reason the West is an easy target for Isis a very easy target especially places in Europe is because they've used those liberal values freedoms equality things like that on they put those over safety for people and you are right that begs a very important question you know when is it too much so there's security there's national security for the civilians and then there's also freedoms and and I think that's one of the guessing games that the West has had a very difficult time playing with not just Europe but North America the US and especially Canada is that they seem to be weighing more so on the side of especially in the US with our last administration on the side of we want all equality freedom we don't to hurt anyone's feelings rather than national Security's concerns I think France has been playing that game for a while they've always weighed more on the side of freedom just being France I think at the last couple years because of the number of Isis attacks in the area they've had to be stronger but still that's not going to stop the fact that the people are gonna be able to do this but thankfully only one person in addition to the actual attacker was killed and so more people weren't killed and I think that shows that French troops are at least getting a little better about stopping it right when it starts now we have to be careful about you know eyewitness accounts and what-have-you but we do have reports that the attacker screamed Allahu Akbar before attacking people there that is a cry which in in its basic essence it doesn't really amount to much but it is in the West what we think of as a battle cry which it really isn't but assuming this does turn out to be motivated by Islamic extremism what do you think is the reason I mean you touch just a little bit of second ago about this this ideology and about that it's not really publicized talk to me a little bit more about that ideology of the Islamic extremism in Europe and it's you know it's a good point there have been a couple reports again this is still an unfolding story there have been a couple random reports in again and hasn't hit mainstream yet that that Isis said one of its soldiers claimed responsibility for this and as you said eyewitness accounts about Allah Akbar in terms of the ideology having researched this this is where I started my research there are n x ideologies these are these are really belief systems that a fringe aspect of Islamists our our you know Muslim followers of extremist or radical ament's they're really trying to prepare their end times the end of the world for them one of those things and it's a fringe belief system but it's saying that in order for their Messiah or their you know their God their Christ their final Imam to return to earth to really assure in this global Caliphate for them they not only need to start preparations to set up the Caliphate they need to cleanse the streets of all infidels that means even Muslims that are moderate or peaceful or things like that they need to cleanse the world of all of that starting with the secular democratic systems of the west and Europe and so you know that's one of the basic ideology that it's really started this group and has perpetuated them even so much so as being saying that they are part of the end times regime that's gonna set up this Caliphate and so that's what started this it's also very easy for them to get into Europe there have been open border policy is because of Europe's more liberal policies and that's why it's made them more of an easy target not wanting to offend anybody or things like that whereas you know why I love my work I work in the Middle East with a lot of Muslims who fight this kind of radical Islamist ideology and they have no problem saying what it is hey these are radical Muslims extremists they go out and they do this and that's what the West needs to become better at doing so you touched on Europe's policies there let's talk about president microns specifically he replaced that international state or that national state of emergency rather with his counterterrorism laws do you think that's strong enough to deal with these types of incidents or is there anything I mean can we police everything the time we really can't and that's what you know it's hard to say because we know that the Islamic state is evil of course this this in fact then there are some reports saying that this was them but just to put it in this perspective here when Isis or ISIL type fighters or militants trying to carry out these attacks the reason they've been successful we need to be careful because we know how evil they are and so sometimes we underestimate people that we disagree with or we know are evil but they're actually very smart because what they've done is rather than carry out some big military attack or things like that they they'll get a car they'll get a truck they'll get a van they'll get a knife and they'll do something that really nobody no matter how good your police forces is gonna be able to take out right away and that's because of past policies so even if president leckrone has enacted this counterterrorism policy in his nation he he already has past years even if he wasn't involved with those of open door policies allowing anybody to come in not wanting to infringe on privacy and not wanting to offend anybody that's allowed the growth of this so it is gonna be hard especially for these nations who spent so many years not wanting to offend that they've already grown the presents and come into there and now these these leaders who are here now are gonna have to say okay we really cannot restrict that many freedoms we can't just take people down because we don't like the way they look and so it's gonna have to train police to be almost psychic in a sense or vigilant in order to see the future of what's gonna happen which which is really gonna be very unlikely alright
