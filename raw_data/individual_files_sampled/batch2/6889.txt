on that website with a unique domain what are you crazy go do it now go during the Golden Globes Oprah Winfrey gave a speech that hinted that she could be possibly considering a presidential run now she never addressed any of those rumors until now she gave an interview to InStyle and during that interview she essentially said that she is not planning on running although I do think that she was this is my speculation considering running and she was just kind of feeling out what the response would be after her speech and then she made her decision again that's my speculation but let me give you her exact quote she told InStyle it's not something that interests me I I met with someone the other day who said that they would help me with the campaign that's not for me she was also quoted as saying that it's not in her DNA which is a weird quote I think that it could be in anyone's DNA but I was really interested to see what the reaction was to her possibly running and it's amazing how quickly the the smear campaigns had started I I saw some of them on Facebook and they were ridiculous so there was this video snippet of her going viral on Facebook and she was talking about what South Africa's like post apartheid and you know what it would take for racism to really be conquered in South Africa and she talked about how well there's some people who were born and raised in that type of environment they were marinated in it and they just need to die right now that wasn't the best way to say it but what she essentially meant was you know the people who were born and raised in that type of environment really bought into it they kind of need to pass on we need newer generations with open minds that's not how she said you said they need to die and so people who don't want her to win took that snippet and made it seem like she was saying she wants white people to die yeah so sometimes people will think that Apple research is conspiratorial no it happens of course anyone who's ever worked on any campaign we talked a lot about this on old school last night by the way tea white tea network.com slash join become a member get all of our shows including old school but it's it's not a conspiracy anyone who's worked on a campaign you know that if it's a large campaign there's a division called Oppo research so they go find clips like that now why would they do awful research on Oprah because she's sitting at a 64 percent popularity they don't want any piece of Oprah now right or wrong I actually don't think that Democratic voters are as enamored with celebrities as Republicans are Republicans all they care about is celebrities Ronald Reagan Donald Trump and then you've got all the Arnold Schwarzenegger they literally they're like hey if any Hollywood celebrity is a Republican be like it will like your right away right away right they're not that bright so they just go for who's on TV and so Democrats on the other hand especially at people like Bernie Sanders supporters so it's Oprah is a good person she's done good things in the world it's you don't dismiss her out of hand but she'd really have to win people over that would be right yeah so to you know kind of add some more support to your argument what I saw from a lot of Democratic voters was criticism toward her political inexperience she's not very experienced politically I mean she's definitely contributed to campaigns but it kind of ends there and also the fact that she is a celebrity like that's not good enough right being a celebrity is not the right credential to becoming the next president of the United States and then you know the the people that were worried about the Hillary types are concerned because she did support Hillary's campaign and all that so Democrats weren't buying it as much as I think some people would expect but the Republicans and Trump's team would be panic anyway because one they don't know that you know and they see her at sixty four percent approval rating and they go oh my god Oppo research immediately right and that was that part of our calculation we have no idea but look anyone who thinks about going into politics if they have a chance of winning will get hit with a ton of Oppo research and it makes them gun-shy because it is dirty you've got the Republic's by the way that it's not even the establishment Democrats you know you think in a primary they wouldn't gone after her of course oh no but she you know she's a good person we can't go after him no they had a leak stuff all over to the press maybe but I get the sense that establishment Democrats are more in favor of her as of no no note they overall yeah you know why she's a huge Democratic donor that's she's the one they serve in a sense but if you're running a race against her they're not gonna be like oh well but oh please I'm just gonna let you win right the only one who wouldn't do up a research and it drives me crazy he should is Bernie imagine Bernie's like I'm gonna undermine Oprah I can I literally can't imagine him yeah okay so anyway you know and I get it she says not in my DNA as in okay III don't think I'm cut out for this it's not what I'm I want to do but when she says that she was interested in it no Stedman Graham her longtime partner didn't tell the LA Times she's interested in it because she wasn't interested she didn't meet with a guy who runs campaigns by her own admission because she wasn't interested in it right she was interested in there's nothing wrong in that I mean look I mean anybody who has some shot at being becoming president most powerful person on earth could do a lot of good and change and he's perfectly normal to be interested in that so it looks like she thought about it she did some deliberations of thought this isn't for me yeah I think she made the right decision but she does remind me of a lot of you know successful people like she's never never never satisfied right I mean she's had such a successful career made a ton of money she grew up in poverty and somehow managed to be one of the richest people in the world right but you know I would say why don't you just enjoy your wealth you know take a load off have some fun but no she's not satisfied I mean she was considering it because I think you know she has goals and aspirations she wants to achieve more and that's admirable but I think she made the right decision here yeah that's right and then so it was a trial balloon they tried it they decided yeah they don't like it or as Ana would put it she felt it out
