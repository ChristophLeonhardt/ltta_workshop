1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,430
We’ve been in the middle of
this really intense debate

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,860
over what to do with the
borders of our country

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,249
and how to deal with the
questions of:

4
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,490
Who gets to come 
into our country?

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,960
How do they come in?
Where do they go?

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,585
What happens to them
when they get here?

7
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:16,020
And you’ve had these two
really interesting extremes

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,760
that have been battling for the
last several decades, frankly.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,640
You’ve had a kind of,
one extreme,

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,270
which is in the
White House right now:

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:26,105
President Trump; 
Stephen Miller, his top adviser;

12
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:27,540
Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

13
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,210
“We don’t want
people coming in.”

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,930
“Don’t you have kids,
Mr. President?”

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,630
And you have the
other extreme,

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,620
where you have people who,
you know, argue for much more

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,230
liberal open borders,
be much more opening

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,030
to refugees,
to asylum seekers.

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,220
What sort of climaxed this week

20
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,470
with this family
separation crisis is,

21
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,690
How do you find a solution
that’s in the middle?

22
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,320
The executive order
essentially says

23
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,350
the administration
is now going to detain

24
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,190
families that come across
the border illegally,

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,130
and they’re seeking
legal permission

26
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,380
to detain them permanently.

27
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,980
If they can’t get
that legal permission,

28
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,830
which, right now,
rests in the hands

29
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,487
of a single federal
judge in California,

30
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:09,440
how does the administration
handle these families?

31
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,640
Well, there’s a couple
of different solutions

32
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,250
that have been out
there in the past.

33
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,070
The Obama administration used
ankle bracelets extensively.

34
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,030
They set up these
pilot programs

35
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,540
where the families
would be put in touch,

36
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,830
would have to register with
a nonprofit organization,

37
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,180
with a community-based
organization that

38
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,250
kept tabs on the families.

39
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,710
The rate at which the people
who are in those programs

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,710
actually came back
for their court hearings

41
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,630
was very, very high,
in the 90 percents,

42
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,250
which suggested that if you
could create some of these

43
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,510
programs on a national scale,
and really broaden them out,

44
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,410
that you could potentially
satisfy President Trump’s

45
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:56,510
concerns about these
people just melting away

46
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,130
into the country
and never coming back.

47
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,230
So there are two big
parts to the president’s

48
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:00,990
executive order:

49
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,050
What’s going to happen
with people going forward?

50
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,180
And then the question
that has arisen:

51
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,720
What’s going to happen
to the people, the children,

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,530
who have already been
separated from their parents

53
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,080
over these last several weeks?

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,890
On that second question,

55
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,070
the executive order
is actually silent.

56
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:19,580
It says nothing about
the existing population

57
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,090
of about 2,300 children who
have been already separated

58
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,740
from their parents.

59
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,320
There are huge
practical hurdles

60
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,420
to bringing all of
these people back,

61
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,790
the main one of which
is that the parents

62
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:35,360
are being held in custody
for criminal proceedings.

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,220
They can either
let the families go,

64
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,760
using ankle bracelets, using
community-based programs —

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,320
that’s the way
that Obama did it,

66
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,653
that’s the way
that Bush did it,

67
00:02:46,653 --> 00:02:49,760
that’s one option.
Or, the other option

68
00:02:49,760 --> 00:00:00,000
would be to go back
to family separation.
