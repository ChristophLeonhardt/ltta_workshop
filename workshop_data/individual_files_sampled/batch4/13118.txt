discuss that was the only real news you're gonna hear for the rest of the show now we gotta get into fake news so this is right out of the left wing playbook you there was this awful shooting last week and this is what they do they wait for a tragedy to happen they pounce on it and they spread fake news and I'm using fake news in a very specific way I mean they are lying about statistics they're lying about incidents and then they accuse anybody who questions that fake news of politicizing the incident this happens every time there's this tragedy we say okay maybe we should all just calm down a little bit mourn for what's happened then they spread a bunch of lies we say why you know that isn't correct actually they say how dare you you're politicizing this I'm politicizing this so you you see this has been happening all the time we hear this from CNN they say including today's shooting incident in a Texas high school this year there have already been 22 school shootings where someone was hurt or killed that averages out to more than one shooting a week that's a terrifying statistic right sure it just isn't true the way they arrived at this statistic is they included it incidents where at least one person is shot not including the shooter that it occurred on school grounds grades K through college through university level it includes gang violence it includes just brawls it includes domestic violence they even include the accidental discharge of any firearm of any firearm at all we're not just talking about a big scary gun so here here are some of the things that are included to let you arrive at that untrue statistic that there have been 22 school shootings this year on April 9th in Globe Roseville New York a student shot another student with a BB gun and that other student had a bruise on his on his body that counts they include that in the statistic they're trying to conflate someone using a little pellet gun and it leaves a bruise to a major school shooting which is awful one because it's dishonest but it's disrespectful to the people who actually were victims of the shooting March 13th in Seaside California a teacher accidentally discharged a firearm during a public safety class no one was killed everyone was okay they're comparing that to ten people being killed March 8th and Alabama a non student was shot at an apartment on the University of South Alabama campus non-student no but the image that they conjure on the left when they say this is some lunatic murderer going into an elementary school and killing children but the the statistic is including people just some guy living on the campus when even a student February in EDA Bena Mississippi a non student was shot at a recreation center at Mississippi Valley State University that's in there too January 1st in Philly a 32 year old non student was shot outside a high school after a fight the guys just walking around to high school he ends up getting shot he's 32 years old but no that's a school shooting because they need to make this number really scary because they need to politicize tragedy when you take out all those extraneous incidents the number becomes 7 school shootings this year and by the way 7 is bad that's not good as that number alone should be alarming but the meme that they use the lefts meme here is to vastly exaggerated the numbers and then when you point out the real numbers you say it's not 22 it's seven they say what 7 is not enough what that's that's nothing to you I said no that that's a big deal but you're the one lying and multiplying it by more than three times what it actually is you see this all the time here's just a quick little rundown from the mainstream media and in that time they have been 20 mass shootings 20 mass shootings in the u.s. we have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no parallel anywhere else in the world there you you heard at the end there is Barack Obama it has no parallel anywhere else in the world 20 mass shootings now of course the number just changes because they've just redefined mass shooting however they want to do it in order to make the numbers seem as big as possible but what Barack Obama just said also isn't true we don't we aren't amout lighter when you compare it to the rest of the world we're not even an outlier when you compare mass shootings in the u.s. to Europe when you define mass shooting to exclude gang violence and terrorist attacks as any reasonable person would mass shooting rates in the United States are on par with Europe they're actually a little bit lower there below Norway there below Macedonia there below Serbia Slovakia Finland Belgium and the Czech Republic we're below all of those but that doesn't jive with the scare tactics they want to say the u.s. is crazy it's just totally crazy out here the implication being the United States has a second Amendment we need to get rid of that but when you look at the actual numbers we're about where everyone else is here's here's another one from CNN and Jimmy Kimmel tweeted this so you know that's how you know it isn't funny is when Jimmy Kimmel tweets something CNN wrote quote the US has had 57 times as many school shootings as the other major industrialized nations combined 288 school shootings since 2009 288 whoa I don't remember that do you remove the news breathlessly reports any of these things 288 I don't I don't know that didn't happen did it those numbers are pushed by anti-gun groups anti Second Amendment groups in particular every town for gun safety which is Mike Bloomberg's group so a Jeff Greenfield who's a longtime contributor to CNN CBS ABC PBS NBC just every three-letter mainstream media left-wing hack shop he said in February 2018 quote in the rest of the world there have been 18 school shootings in the last 20 years in the u.s. there have been 18 since January first even politifact which is a left-leaning website rated that statement mostly false this was a statement made by a well-respected member of the mainstream media who has worked for every mainstream media outlet practically that there is and he's getting his information like so many of the others from every town for gun safety and just look the left does this I did a Praeger video recently about language how the left uses language and twists language to change the narrative and to control the culture they use the word every town for gun safety not travel through Texas travel through the South travel through the Midwest I don't think those towns are the towns that want to abridge our Second Amendment in frigid on our gun ownership rights in the country but they say every time because they said look we all agree we all agree every time for gun safety so I thought you were talking about gun control no gun safety because I have a safety on my gun there's a little safety switch like flick it up click it down that's my gun safety I don't think they're advocating for that I think they want to take away the guns so every town includes among their counting's of all of these so-called shootings they include on January 3rd East Olive elementary school in Michigan a man committed suicide in that school parking lot that's a mass shooting that's the school shootings Coronado elementary in Arizona a student committed suicide in the bathroom there were no other injuries sad story not what we think of when we think of a school shooting not of mass shooting Murphy high in Alabama student fired a gun into the air outside of school after an argument I don't maybe that's just how they celebrate down in Alabama you know like that was the one with the big mustache on Looney Tunes anyway nobody was injured and that counts as a mass school shooting here is a Democrat running for governor in Florida here's what he's saying we send our children off to school we want to know they're safe but here in Florida despite 14 school shootings in eight years we still have some of the weakest gun laws in the nation that's Philip Levine not true not true flat outlines so how does he get to that number fourteen school shootings in the last five minutes or whatever ridiculous scare claim he's making well March 2012 and a pistol at the Episcopal School of Jacksonville a Spanish teacher was fired and the disgruntled employee went and killed the his boss basically the head of the school then killed himself it's now what we think of when we think of a school shooting January 2013 there was a shooting in Fort Myers a 27 year old was believed to have been killed by gangs in retaliation a retaliation killing for speaking to cops that's a 27 year old that's not a poor kid being gunned down in his own school March 2013 a 30 year old student killed himself at the University of Central Florida March 2014 an elementary school teacher was killed by her husband all very sad stories but to conflate it with these mass shootings is just a lie again even left-leaning PolitiFact rated that mostly false here's another one let's roll some more mainstream clips the school shootings in Orion and at Washington State are just two among a startling number of school shootings this year 22news reveals how many there have been and how it's affecting people in western Massachusetts 37 that's how many school shootings there have been in the US this year every town for gun safety calculated the findings local parents say the statistics are alarming we saturate ourselves too much we're in violence our whole culture and it just doesn't seem you can't do anything about it it's like throwing a wiffle ball into the wind what's even more shocking is the number of school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012 in the 18 months since there have been 74 instances of shots fired on school grounds not true those numbers just are not right again even politifact even left-leaning PolitiFact rates that mostly false when you delve into the numbers of the 74 this is 74 numbers how do you get to that number when you get to actual school shootings at the very highest count that number is 10 is that a high number yes is that number too high yes is it scary yes is it tragic yes 10 of 74 there were another 39 that were caused by drug dealing robbery and personal altercations that's nearly four times as many as we would call school shootings have that incidents outside of school hours they had nothing to do with the school people just happen to be walking onto the school because it's public property 16 that's a 60% 60% higher than the number of Acts school shootings suicide six accidental discharge 374 incidents that they count resulted in 38 deaths is that high yes is that sad yes relative to 74 incidents though that's a relatively modest number of deaths because if you say there have been 74 school shootings what comes up into people's minds is 10 people killed in each of these so you have this image in your mind that I don't know 740 750 people have been killed in one of these school shootings but really it's 38 and a lot of suicide a lot are gang-related a lot or or robbery related nearly half by the way 35 of them took place at colleges or universities again you hear school shooting and the left is so good at this when they politicize this issue constantly you think of these poor little elementary school kids at Sandy Hook or something half of them are colleges or universities sometimes involving non students people in their 30s people who are older whenever guns are involved there is massive manipulation that happens on the Left emotional manipulation statistical manipulation legal manipulation emotionally they want to put these images in your head that are not true statistically they exaggerate the numbers legally they try to get around the Second Amendment contrary to the mainstream media reporting contrary to these sad events that do happen from time to time there has been no spike in recent decades of children killed at schools they say that there is an epidemic going on it's a getting crazy we have to do something it's it's getting so much worse in fact in reality children killed in school shootings are down 75 percent since the early 1990s they're not up 75 percent they're not up a hundred percent it's fallen 75 percent more children are killed each year by swimming pools and bicycles than by mass shootings in school mass shootings in general over the past several decades there have been gun control laws enacted urban gun control laws repealed they have had no effect they've had a negligible effect on these numbers and that includes the assault weapons ban of 1994 which then expired 10 years later and that brings us to the gun control aspect here because in this recent very sad shooting there was no ar-15 used in the recent shootings the left in order to push gun control and to politicize these tragedies said we need to ban semi-automatic rifles ar-15 since the semi automatic semi-automatic means you pulled the trigger once and a bullet comes out we know that five times as many people each year are murdered with knives as with rifles of any kind including semi-automatic including ar-15 we know one and a half times as many people are killed with baseball bats and clubs and hammers we know that two times as many people are killed with hands and feet we know that over 19 times as many people are killed with handguns as with rifles of any kind including air 15 but in this shooting no ar-15 this was you a shotgun a revolver and and homemade explosives Molotov cocktails I mean this was a sick sick puppy who committed this act but he wasn't using the ar-15 in fact a shotgun was pump-action wasn't even semi-automatic he had to pump the shotgun which means we're talking about the simplest gun that there is practice practically no simpler gun in the country this isn't some super high-tech thing very basic gun the gun control crowd has pounced on the shooting but what are they gonna say now they can't say hey this scary-lookin gun we need to just ban this one because now we're talking bout the most basic on there is so guess I think to the heart of the argument to help us make sense of the media reaction I have got two guys here with a lot of experience in the media spotlight on gun control Kyle Kashyap and Kenneth Preston we're gonna talk to them in just one second but before and now that now that I'm you know that we have them here it's gonna be expert opinion and discussion I need you to listen to a little bit little bits is really good a wonderful sponsor and listen you know these guys are these guys are pretty young 18 19 years old and we try to reach the youth in this program so I'm going to tell you

dot-com slash Noel's Kano wles $10 off a droid inventor kit gentlemen thank you for being here we've got Kyle cash of Kenneth Preston what are you guys doing in town oh we were at a convention a few days ago a gun convention and we've just been going around and seeing this deplorable city city well I gotta say you make very astute observations you have becomes because I've had you both on my show before and we came on after the shooting at your high school you came on to talk about the media reaction this media frenzy that came around the high school and then Kenneth you produced this incredible report I think you're the last journalist in America it's you and Cheryl Atkinson at you actually produce this investigative report on all of the abuses all the total failures of Broward County that led to that shooting that they might have a lot of guilt on their hands for allowing this guy to slip through the cracks in the meantime since I've talked to you both you have become a Twitter storm Kyle you are it is one of the best Twitter accounts on the Internet thank you it you were making all of these observations I think you're doing better than perhaps some other young activists around the country I would agree I'm sure you would so I want to begin a Kyle you are recently I saw this tweet you are currently ranked number one in your high school right there you don't go on CNN as much as members of your high school class but you are ranked now they cut me off they cut you to CNN cut you off I was supposed to go on and they they cut off from the internet interview did they really ya know backed out it's is it it's well I wonder what it what's the difference what is it about you that my I couldn't tell you I I don't know what it is I obviously couldn't yet so you're number one your class by the way I hate to break this to you there's no way that your teachers and school administration are ever gonna let you be valedictorian that is just not gonna happen I've doubled down on taking more classes this summer yeah what do you what classes are you - I'm taking like three random college classes that I've never heard of before just to make sure I solidify number one I don't know if I took three classes in college either I did a lot of things in college I don't have I don't three whole classes yeah in a serious note do you find it heart you've become this media celebrity since the shooting because you came out and said enough is enough with the the media manipulation here yeah I call yes you called BS on it you happen to be a supporter of the Second Amendment that was very taboo do you find it's hard to manage remaining a high school students staying number one in your class and having all of this attention on you oh yeah definitely like I have to make sure I don't slip up in any way shape or form or I'm gonna be the media will definitely jump on it specifically at school I get a lot of hate i gets tear downs at school you really absolutely like I keep a tracker every day of how many people stay redound it's close like two to three people every day do you is the schools very left-wing yes very of course I call schools are certainly that in now so but you become a Twitter celebrity all in all I'm very happy about that because you have a great perspective Kenneth you have produced this serious body of work serious allegations against local officials it was briefly reported by some people in the conservative media and basically it's been blacked out no one is reporting on this what's going on well there was a there was an but for just a moment and and exactly as you said it disappeared we had some traction Marco Rubio called for an investigation into some of our claims so you know behind the scenes things are going on but really local officials local media nobody's covering him the interesting thing though is that we finally had they were denying for months that any of the information was true or correct in the superintendent had to come out and finally admit to the fact that they were misleading at the beginning they said that the student was never part of these disciplined programs and in fact a reporter revealed but that the student was he was referred to the shooter was part of these different programs and because of the policies of Broward County right he was not processed they said oh we're gonna sweep this under the rug basically and they denied that from the beginning and finally it came to light that that was the truth this is this is really interesting work and it actually shows something in the culture both of you guys because the mainstream media they try to create a big show they try to create the illusion of popular support but it's it seems astroturfed doesn't it you know you're you're doing you know some of your classmates will go on TV and and just lie safe fate fakes logistics slander US senators and civil rights advocates and they're lauded and applauded the minute that you contravene that orthodoxy in the media the minute you start going after the media they turn on you they try to shut you down you you have some issues at school but also issues with the local law enforcement officials i I do want your thoughts up broadly because I've tried to only focus these conversations on the media the media have descended on parkland and Broward County this debate has gone on a long time and it's in its most recent iteration in this recent shooting at the Santa Fe Texas the killer was on the honor roll the killer was a football player the killer was apparently just a regular high school student there weren't a lot of signs there we didn't fall through the cracks of disciplinary programs as far as we know and yet people demand no more never again we need to do something we need to prevent these from ever happening again is there a chance that this just was not preventable well yeah definitely I mean there are certain aspects where it could have been prevented had there been the proper school resource officers on campus being able to defend it that's why you see the kids calling we want to arm schools you wanted like hardened schools but I think fundamentally what the left is proposing for like the photo shooting to happen in my school would not have stopped the the Texas shooting that we see right now that's that's a really good point it didn't didn't even occur to me you're right if you have people there who can physically stop these shooting because once the shooter is on campus you're screwed unless you have someone like the cliche is that only a good guy with the gun can stop a bad guy with the gun but it's true yeah right and that's the only way you can stop them yeah that's right just to call it a cliche doesn't mean it isn't true it's obviously it is obviously true I want to know you know our pal around here you know we broadcast from the broom closet of the ben shapiro show the guy who broadcasts from the studio of the ben shapiro show he says facts don't care about your feelings but it seems like the gun control activists and the media don't care about facts I mean we just ran through all of those bogus statistics that they are breathlessly reporting support for stricter gun laws is at the highest level it's been since and despite the fact that no gun law proposed in recent years would have prevented any of these shootings how can we combat that perception do what is the way to get people to care about facts on the gun debate well I think it's it's not necessarily just a gun debate it's it's something that should be looked at as a multi-faceted issue and I think the way to do that is to bring them the fact that look it whatever you're feeling is on guns there were systemic failures that led to the body count that day systemic failures and to show them that to present the evidence and to now what we're doing is running school board members and showing them that there is a better way I believe that once we implement those changes and things start to fix themselves that the conversation is gonna begin to shift that's such a that's such a good point and to hear you speak about this you sound like adults the reason you know I was real I got a I have to admit I was very hesitant at first to talk to you guys about gun control because I don't catch certainly should be well because I think just because a 17 year old or an eighteen year old has lived through some experience that doesn't make him an expert on constitutional law or crime prevention and then CNN put your classmates on TV immediately and said get emotional get but to hear you talk about it you you're not impassioned and calling people names and you're looking at this in a very systematic way and saying oh maybe that maybe that law if that if that law hadn't been in place the heat this guy would have been caught if this policy had been enforced if this money had been spent if you can actually do it in a very rational and systematic way that is utterly missing from the debate on this issue I want to know what is next for you guys you're the last journalist in America Kenneth what's next what can we look for from you where can we find you sure right right now I would all I'm doing is working on school board races ensuring that the current leadership is not here come November so that we can harden our schools what we want to do is to make sure that Broward County is an example to the rest of the country of what a school district can be and after that just continuing to expose some elected officials that have some some answering to do it's great work because it's not glamorous first of all running those races is not glamorous I've run a bunch of small races running them is not glamorous covering local politics is not glamorous but it is the most important work in politics so god speed with that Kyle we're just following you on Twitter I will continue bashing liberals with their leftist tears every single day on Twitter and I'm going to make sure I fight for the Second Amendment non-stop you know it's it is a more glamorous way of life I will say having done it myself it's very fun and very important gentlemen so good to see me I look forward to seeing you guys next time you're back in town I've got to say goodbye to you people before we get to the news we have so much good news today we a guy you know Donald Trump calls ms-13 animals the mainstream media defend them they say they're not animals and then an ms-13 guy is literally named animal he gets sentenced to 40 years in jail for murdering a 15 year old boy we will get to that we will get to all of the lies about Harvey Milk we will get to the stain history but you got to go to daily wire.com go there right now why it is $10 a month $100 for an annual membership you get me you get the end reclaim ensure you get the Ben Shapiro show ask questions in the mailbag ask questions on the conversation I don't I'll give you a back rub or something I don't know what it comes with but you get the leftist ears tumblr here it is here it is folks the when that guy you're gonna have 40 years of leftist ears as a mr. animal from MS the routine is rotting away in prison as we talk about the reality of Harvey Milk go there right now daily wire.com we'll be right back all right so we've got a lot of news to get to today really cool to talk to those guys by the way let's try to run through in the last 10 minutes so before we get to this day in history and Harvey Milk Donald Trump is a prophet he actually as a prophet an ms-13 gang member nicknamed animal receives a 40 year prison sentence this week for conspiracy to murder a 15 year old boy Joel Martinez admitted to prosecutors that he murdered this boy quote I stabbed the culero three times he stared at me and he asked me if I was going to if I was going to stab him I told him yes the Mara rules you Maura for the name of his gang killing people is a requirement for achieving full status in the Massachusetts chapter of ms-13 and the end the left denies this Donald Trump attacks ms-13 the left begins to defendant why is it what's going on here why does it say this seems to be the case a lot with Trump Trump will say something and then it'll just happen you say and you saw this throughout the 2016 campaign say how does he do this but the reason it's not because he's Nostradamus it's because Donald Trump observes reality that's actually why that's why he was a good marketer that's why he was a good TV personality it's why he was good in business he observes reality he's a people person so he sees what's actually happening the mainstream media don't do that the mainstream media are caught in their own ideological views of the world you see this with some conservatives who remain stubbornly anti Trump like there's only one of them left I rights for one of those legacy conservative magazines and tweets all the time and but I think most have come around you know some of the really anti Trump voices Jonah Goldberg I was pleased to see said he would vote for Donald Trump a number of others you know have said okay we'll come along I had been where the mag I had a long time ago actually he came around a long time and but some people are so they stick in this despite all of the evidence to the contrary why is that because they're in an ideological world just just like the mainstream media it's just two sides of the same coin but in the real world of politics where things are actually happening in real time that that lower sea conservatism that's where Donald Trump is getting everything right and just because in case you thought that God sometimes paints with too subtle a brush a literal sinkhole has now opened up on the White House lawn here in the swamp an actual sinkhole is trying to engulf the Trump White House one opened up over the weekend a second one opened up next to it got noticeably bigger between Sunday and Monday it's over a foot long now oh I guess you could say all nature is but art unknown today all chance direction which thou canst not see this is an important sign this is a symbol and it should remind us of something I don't know how much of reality is being reflected by the White House lawn but it is certainly the case that the swamp of Washington DC is trying to swallow this president a lot of people took the wrong lessons from Watergate and we're seeing some of that play out again there is a concerted political effort to take down this president they want him impeached they want him subpoenaed they want him prosecuted they want him in any way to get this guy out of office because they cannot accept the election Democrats are known for this they couldn't accept the 2000 election they never let that go that couldn't accept the 2016 election because they were so sure you're trying to swallow up this president by any means necessary it's a really dangerous thing Republicans don't do this when Democrats win elections even Barack Obama who is so awful he was just such a bad president both in that he was thickness and undermined American credibility but also it was so radically left-wing and obviously didn't like America very much the reason we know that he didn't like America very much as he said he wants to fundamentally transform it and you don't want to fundamentally transform things that you like so even that guy we didn't try to impeach him there was never any serious effort on the right to impeach Barack Obama and that Congress never voted to impeach the guy but they're trying to get Donald Trump this is why we need to rally around in des femmes Donald Trump because the sinkhole on the White House lawn figurative and literal is trying to swallow him up whole politics is a team sport there are parties you play for a team and it's not frivolous it's not some little hobby you're on that team because you believe what that team is doing you support what that team is doing the reason that I support Donald Trump is not because I'm a Republican I'm a Republican because I believe certain things I'm a conservative because I have a vision for the country Donald Trump is the is the captain of that team right now and you gotta support him even if you don't like the way he sips Chardonnay even if he doesn't put his pinkie out the right way he's the guy he's doing the right thing and you got to come along as politics is a team sport and if you try to extract yourself above that or say oh I don't I don't want to be on this team that isn't that isn't how politics is done that isn't what it is so I urge everybody to beware of the sinkhole that is about to swallow up the White House finally before we get out of here this day in history we got to talk about Harvey Milk did you know it's Harvey Milk day it's a happy Harvey Milk day everybody do you know that do people even know who Harvey Milk is no because they did this this all came about because Hollywood like it always does made a totally dishonest film about a left winger and tried to make him into a hero and all of a sudden there was all this Pro Harvey Milk activism Harvey Milk was a gay activist in San Francisco in the 1970s he's the first openly gay elected official in California he ran for office four times in San Francisco didn't win most of the time eventually he got on to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors he only served there for I think eleven months before he was assassinated be not assassinated because he was gay by the way assassinated by a political opponent basically who assassinated a straight guy too they've created this lionized character of Harvey Milk in recent years there was a Sean Penn movie made and he was the fighter and people were attacking him because he was gay they tried to bomb out his store and they assassinated because he was gay none of that is true there was a bomb attack on his store but his friends admitted in later years that Harvey Milk was probably complicit in planning that because the campaign wasn't doing very well to quote them and he needed to get a little bit more attention Harvey Milk moved to San Francisco along with lots of other gay men in the early 1970s he was finally elected in 1978 and I mean after this movie came out the California established Harvey Milk Day 2009 Barack Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom that year who is the real Harvey Milk well what do we know about the guy we know that he was basically a pederast cult leader he preyed on a 16 year old runaway named Jack Galen McKinley the age of consent in California by the way is 18 years old you thought that the Republicans had a problem with Roy Moore to hear the left talk about Roy Moore you you'd think I mean and these were allegations that weren't quite proven there were discrepancies with some of the evidence it was in the heat of a political campaign we hadn't heard about this before because Roy Moore had a fling with a 16 year old girl allegedly this guy Harvey Milk wins the Presidential Medal of Freedom he had an open relationship when he was in 30s with a 16 year old runaway boy but it get it gets worse from there Harvey Milk was also pals with Jim Jones where have I heard that name before the guy who passed around the kool aid killed nine hundred people at the People's Temple in Guyana he was good friends with Jim Jones he wrecked a Harvey Milk regularly attended the People's Temple he defended Jim Jones to Jimmy Carter so there was an inquiry into Jim Jones because Jim Jones abducted a six-year-old kid in Guyana six-year-old little boy and Harvey Milk wrote to Jimmy Carter and said Jim Jones is a man of the highest character you've got he slandered the kid's own parents who were down there he worked together with Jim Jones he used them as help for his campaign at Harvey Milk was he was a nobody he was a guy of questionable past he he did believe strongly in promoting gay political rights and that's all the left needed to know about him to turn him into a hero but he wasn't a hero in his personal life he was an absolute derelict it was the sort of guy where if he were a Republican when people would want that left would want to throw him in jail but because he supported gay rights they had to create a narrative about him and the left always does this you'll see they'll go on television they'll say they'll make some outrageous claim and then when you point out that it isn't true they'll say yeah it's not true but it gets to a larger truth what yeah no it's a lie but a lot but the lie you know it's a larger truth so how do you get to them that's because it's all about illusion it's all about look over here it's all Hollywood glitz and glamor and that's what's happened with Harvey Milk the cartoon character of RV milk that that Sean Penn played in that movie has very little if anything to do with Harvey Milk himself you're seeing this happen in the mainstream media every single day so the mainstream media they say Donald Trump has never been more unpopular it's over II colluded with Russia he did this to a porn story bla bla bla bla bla all of this noise right and yet we look at the polling Trump is still quite popular more popular or as popular as Barack Obama on the relative days of their presidency the economy is doing well electoral chances are looking good I don't want to jinx it but maybe what tomorrow will go into some of the data on those races things on in reality when you talk to people in reality are looking pretty good don't be fooled by the left illusion don't be fooled by Harvey Milk day don't be fooled by Hollywood don't be fooled by the New York Times or CNN or the Washington Post take a look around reality because when people look at reality they're they're able to predict the future they're able to do very well they're able to see kind of what's in the air what's going on and we've we've seen that with the Donald Trump movement it's an important political lesson to gather from president co f f/a we'll have much more Kofi Fay tomorrow in the meantime I'm Michael
