VEHICLE.

CITY NEWSROOM WITH MORE.
>> REPORTER: THE RUSSIAN NEWS
AGENCY IS REPORTING THE TAXI
DRIVER IS TELLING RUSSIAN POLICE
HE FELL ASLEEP BEHIND THE WHEEL,
CAUSING HIS CAR TO GO ONTO A
BUSY SIDEWALK, MOWING DOWN
PEDESTRIANS AT RED SQUARE IN
MOSCOW.
EIGHT PEOPLE ARE INJURED, TWO OF
THE INJURED ARE MEXICAN.
THE STREETS OF MOSCOW ARE
FESTIVE AND PACKED WITH VIEWING
PARTIES AND FANS THAT ARE ALL
THERE FOR THE WORLD CUP.
THESE ARE PHOTOS FROM THE SCENE
BUT VIDEO ONLINE IS REALLY JUST
HORRIFIC AND WE'RE EFFORTING TO
GET IT.
IT SHOWS THE TAXI DRIVER COMING
TO AN ALMOST COMPLETE STOP
BEFORE IT SWERVES TO THE RIGHT,
ACCELERATING ONTO A SIDEWALK FOR
FIVE SECONDS, PLOWING INTO
PEDESTRIANS.
THE CAR STOPS, TWO BYSTANDERS
COME TO THE WINDOW AND THEN THE
DRIVER JUST RUNS OUT OF THE CAB
AS ABOUT A HALF A DOZEN
PEDESTRIANS CHASE HIM IN THE
STREETS OF MOSCOW.
THE DRIVER IS A CITIZEN OF
KURZIKSTAN.
HE TOLD POLICE THIS WAS NOT
INTENTIONAL.
WITNESSES SAY THEY FIND IT HARD
TO BELIEVE.
>> I HAVE THE FEELING HE DID IT
DELIBERATELY BECAUSE HE WAS IN
THE TRAFFIC JAM.
THE CARS WERE GOING REALLY SLOW.
HOW CAN YOU LOSE CONTROL OF THE
WHEEL, PUSH THE GAS AND DRIVE
INTO THE CROWD?
>> REPORTER: THIS INCIDENT COMES
A DAY AFTER THE U.S. STATE
DEPARTMENT ISSUED A TRAVEL
ADVISORY URGING AMERICANS TO
RECONSIDER TRAVELING TO RUSSIA
FOR THE WORLD CUP BECAUSE OF THE
HEIGHTENED DANGER FOR TERRORIST
ATTACKS.
THE WORLD CUP PRESENTS A LARGE
TARGET.
RUSSIA HAS HAD A HISTORY OF
TERRORIST ATTACKS FROM THEIR
NEIGHBOR AND THEY ARE INVOLVED
IN THE CIVIL WAR IN SYRIA.
MORE THAN 88,000 AMERICANS HAVE
BOUGHT WORLD CUP TICKETS, THE
SECOND MOST OF ANY NATION, OWNED
BEHIND THE RUSSIANS.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS
AMERICAN WHOSE ARE CHOOSING TO
GO TO RUSSIA NEED TO BE ON ALERT
BECAUSE, QUOTE, WELL, THEY SAY
BECAUSE, QUOTE, DUE TO THE
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT IMPOSED
REDUCTION ON U.S. DIPLOMATIC
PERSONNEL IN RUSSIA, THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT HAS REDUCED ABILITY
TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO U.S.
CITIZENS.
NOW, AS FOR THIS TAXI INCIDENT,
THE DRIVER'S DETAINED, A
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS UNDER
WAY.
HE SAYS HE FELL ASLEEP.
RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES ARE
QUESTIONING HIM AND THEY'RE
CALLING IT A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.
