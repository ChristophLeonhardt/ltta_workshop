ROSENSTEIN.
WE HAVE TWO MEMBERS ON THE
COMMITTEE.
JOHN RATCLIFF WILL JOIN US
MOMENTARILY.
JIM MAJOR DON IS
JIM MAJOR -ON IS
JIM MAJOR --N IS
JIM MAJOR -- JIS
JIM MAJOR -- JORDON IS JOINING
ME.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> YOU BET, GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.
>> YOU HAVE A BIG WEEK AHEAD.
GLENN SIMPSON WAS EXPECTED.
FRIDAY NELLI.
ROSENSTEIN WAS SUPPOSE TO MEET
WHAT HAPPENED?
>> HE DIDN'T SHOW UP.
WHEN YOU ARE ASKED TO COME YOU
ARE OBLIGATED TO COME AND
TESTIFY UNDER OATH.
IF IT TAKES A SUBPOENA THAT WILL
HAPPEN.
WE NEED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS
ABOUT ALL KINDS OF ISSUES BUT
THE STATEMENT THAT HE ALLEGEDLY
SAID ABOUT RECORDING THE
COMMANDER AND CHIEF OF OUR GREAT
COUNTRY AND THE 25th
AMENDMENT.
>> NOW HE SAID HE WAS SAYING IT
SARCASTICALLY AND JOKE.
SINCE HE SAID THAT HE DIDN'T
REALLY MEAN THAT IN A SERIOUS
WAY WE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO DID AN OP ED ON THIS.
YOU HAVE JOHN SOLOMON FROM THE
HILL.
IN HIS OP ED HE WRITES THIS.
THIS WAS THE PLAN.
HE JOINED ME LAST WEEK ON FOX
BUSINESS NETWORK ON THE MORNING
PROGRAM.
THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD US.
>> THERE ARE THREE SEPARATE FBI
AGENTS ALL WHO SAY THIS WAS A
SERIOUS PLOT.
THIS WASN'T A JOKE.
THERE WAS A REAL DISCUSSION IN
MAY AFTER COMBY WAS FIRED ABOUT
TAKING OUT THE PRESIDENT AND
RECORDING HIM AND INVOKING THE
25th AMENDMENT.
THINK ABOUT HOW EXTRA ORDINARY
THAT IS.
YOU HAVE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
AND FBI HAVING THE DISCUSSION.
JOKE OR NO JOKE IT'S A SERIOUS
MATTER AND INFRINGEMENT ON WHAT
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND FBI
IS SUPPOSE TO DO.
I WOULD SUSPECT THAT LAWMAKERS
LIKE MYSELF ISSUE A SUBPOENA TO
FORCE THE ISSUE WITH ROSENSTEIN.
THAT'S THE SECOND THING TO
WATCH.
>> CONGRESSMAN, YOUR TAKE.
>> EXACTLY.
HE HAS TO COME IN AND ANSWER
QUESTIONS.
WHEN JIM BAKER WAS IN HIS
TELESCOPING TWO WEEKS AGO AND
ASKED ABOUT THIS HE WAS AS
SERIOUS AS HE COULD BE IN
DESCRIBING WHAT HE SAW TAKE
PLACE IN THE MEETING WERE MR.
ROSENSTEIN SPOKE ABOUT RECORDING
THE PRESIDENT.
IF IT TAKES A SUBPOENA THAT'S
WHAT SHOULD BE ISSUED.
>> YOU WERE IN THE FIRST
INTERVIEW WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM
JAMES BAKER?
>> THIS IS THE FBI CHIEF
COUNCIL.
ALL KINDS OF THINGS FLOW THROUGH
HIM.
WHEN HE SAID HE BELIEVED
ROSENSTEIN WAS SERIOUS ABOUT
THIS ALLEGED STATEMENT ABOUT
RECORDING THE PRESIDENT YOU HAVE
TO TAKE THAT WITH THE WEIGHT IT
COMES WITH BECAUSE IT'S THE FBI
CHIEF COUNCIL.
WE'LL ASK HIM MORE ABOUT THAT.
OUR PREVIOUS TELESCOPING WAS
CUTOFF
METOFF
MEETFF
MEETING.ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEED
MEETING.ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEET
MEETING.ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEEO
MEETING.ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEEB
MEETING.ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEEE
ASKED.
>> YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO HIM
ALREADY AND ALSO WITH THE LAWYER
FROM THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE.
TELL US WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT.
>> YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE
COMMUNICATING.
YOU HAVE NELLI'S HUSBAND THAT
WAS GETTING INFORMATION THAT HE
WAS PASSING ON.
YOU HAD GLENN SIMPSON PASSING PS
YOU HAD GLENN SIMPSON PASSING PI
YOU HAD GLENN SIMPSON PASSING PG
INFORMATION TO THE FBI.
NOW THEY ARE GIVING INFORMATION
TO THE CHIEF COUNCIL AS WELL.
THE MORE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TALKING
ABOUT THE BIG LIE THE MORE THEY
ARE TO BELIEVE IT.
THAT'S THE TECHNIQUE AND METHOD
THEY WERE TRYING TO USE.
>> WHAT MUST BE SAID ARE THE
PEOPLE WHO WERE GIVING THE
INFORMATION TO THE FBI WERE
WORKING FOR THE OPPOSITION,
HILLARY CLINTON.
>> BRUCE'S WIFE WAS WORKING FOR
THE OPPOSITION.
SIMPSON WAS WORKING FOR THE
OPPOSITION.
ALSO THE KEY LAWYER WAS THE KEY
LAWYER FOR THE NATIONAL
COMMITTEE AND CLINTON CAMPAIGN.
THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PUT
TOGETHER WAS USED TO GO TO THE
SECRET COURT TO SPY ON THE
CAMPAIGN.
THAT'S NEVER SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN
BUT IT DID.
>>Reporter: ROD ROSENSTEIN
OKAYED THE FINAL FISA WARRANT.
THE WARRANT TO SPY ON CARTER
PAGE WAS RENEWED THREE TIMES AND
THE FINAL WAS GIVEN THE GLEAN
LIGHT.
IS HE A WITNESS?
>> EXACTLY RIGHT, THERE ARE ALL
KINDS OF CONFLICTS HERE.
WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN IN
CONFLICT IN ARGUING ABOUT WHO
SHOULD BE REDUCED.
BOTH OF THEM SHOULD BE REDUCED.
>>Reporter: LET ME ASK YOU
ABOUT THE CONFLICTS ABOUT WHAT
YOU LADDER FROM ANDREW MCCABE
WHO HAS BEEN REFERRED TO
CRIMINAL CHARGES.
APPARENTLY THERE ARE CONFLICTS.
>> YEAH.
NO, THERE ARE.
LIKE YOU SAID, BOTH OF THEM
SHOULDN'T BE OVERSEEING THE
MUELLER INVESTIGATION.
ROSENSTEIN WROTE THE MEMO THAT
WAS GIVEN TO THE PRESIDENT ONE
OF THE THINGS MUELLER IS LOOKING
INTO IS OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE.
NEITHER SHOULD BE INVOLVED.
MCCABE ISN'T BECAUSE HE'S BEEN
FIRED.
>> THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
WOULDN'T FIRE ROSENSTEIN, SHOULD
HE STEP DOWN?
>> WELL, LOOK, I'M NOT A FAN OF
MR.  ROSENSTEIN.
WE ASKED FOR THE MCCABE MEMOS.
WE ASKED TO SEE THE DOCUMENT MR
ROSINSTEIN WROTE THAT ALTERED
THE SCOPE.
WE ASKED FOR SPECIFIC PORTIONS
OF THE FISA AND HAVEN'T BEEN
ABLE TO SEE THAT.
WE ASKED FOR 302s DETAILS WHAT
HE SAID AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN
THAT.
JON, THE GUY PUT IN CHARGE OF
THE U.S. ATTORNEY WE HAVEN'T HAD
ONE REPORT IN THE LAST SIX
MONTHS SINCE BEEN ON-THE-JOB.
TAKE ALL OF THAT THAT'S WHAT
FLUSTRATES ME AND YOU AND THE
MEDIA AND THOSE PEOPLE A CROSS
THE GREAT COUNTRY THAT WANT TO
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE
IMPLICATIONS.
YOU JUST RATTLED OFF A FEW
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE PUBLIC.
WILL THE PRESIDENT DECLASSIFY
THESE.COM
THESE DOM
THESE DOCUMENTS?
>> LET'S HOPE SO, I A FEW WEEKS
AGO THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WOULD
DECLASSIFY THEM.
HE ALTERED THAT AND SAID HE WILL
RUN IT BY THE INSPECTOR GENERAL.
I THINK WE'LL GET THE
INFORMATION.
WE NEED TO BECAUSE AGAIN, WE
HAVE TO GET ANSWERS FROM THE
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT GO TO
THE HEART OF THE IDEA THAT IT
SHOULD BE EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER
THE LAW.
IT'S SUPPOSE TO BE THE RULE OF
LAW.
THAT'S HOW THE FBI STARTED AND
LOST AND RAN THE INVESTIGATION.
>> THEY WERE OVERSEEING TWO
INVESTIGATIONS.
AT THE SAME TIME THEY RAN THE
INVESTIGATION INTO HILLARY
CLINTON AND HER E-MAIL SCANDAL
AND THOSE TWO WERE HANDLED VERY
DIFFERENTLY.
YOU SAID IT, THIS IS ABOUT
AMERICA AND THE RULE OF LAW.
THIS SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED.
PEOPLE OF POWER PUT THEIR FINGER
ON THE SCALE.
WILL THERE BE ACCOUNTABILITY.
>> I HOPE WE GET A JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT THAT WILL HOLD PEOPLE
ACCOUNTABLE.
THE FLUSTERING PART IS THE
PATTERN.
WE HAD THE IRS TARGET THEM AND
SHE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE CONGRESS.
WE HAD BRYAN SET UP THE E-MAIL
SEVERS.
HE WAS CALLED AND TOOK THE
FIFTH.
WE HAVE GLENN SIMPSON THE GUY
PAID FOR BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN
AND PUT TOGETHER THE FAKE
DOSSIER.
HE WILL COME IN FRONT OF
CONGRESS AND TAKE THE FIFTH AS
WELL.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE ALL
GETTING AWAY WITH IT.
>> THAT HE SAYS WHAT DRIVING
AMERICANS CRAZY.
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT
STANDARDS THAT'S WHY I'M
DETERMINED TO GET THE SUBPOENAS
WE NEED AND PROSECUTE PEOPLE WHO
DESERVE IT.
>> THERE IS A BIG IF.
IF YOU HOLD ONTO IT MAJORITY.
MANY WONDER IF THEY WILL
