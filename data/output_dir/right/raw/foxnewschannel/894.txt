16
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,619
PRESIDENT TRUMP NEARLY SPIKED A

17
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:29,387
CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED IMMIGRATION

18
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:29,854

VISA LOTTERY SYSTEM.

30
00:01:07,125 --> 00:01:08,426
AND IT WOULD ALLOW THE SO-CALLED

00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:11,262
DREAMERS TO APPLY FOR A SIX YEAR

32
00:01:11,262 --> 00:01:11,796

52
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:59,043
CAN CHANGE IT TONIGHT, WE COULD

53
00:01:59,043 --> 00:02:02,480
CHANGE IT RIGHT NOW.

54
