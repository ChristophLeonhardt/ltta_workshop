00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:22,642
PROGRAM OVER THE YEARS.

10
00:00:22,642 --> 00:00:25,545
I PICKED THIS CODE BECAUSE IT

11
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,547
BECAME, FOR HIM, A WAY FOR

12
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:28,548
HIM TO CONSTANTLY MAKE FUN OF ME

13
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:29,715

14
00:00:29,715 --> 00:00:31,217
SPECIAL MOMENT BETWEEN US I WANT

15
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:33,986

>> Sean: BY THE WAY, I LOVE

17
00:00:35,788 --> 00:00:37,123
THE FACT THAT YOU GAVE A SPEECH

18
00:00:37,123 --> 00:00:38,591
ONE DAY AND YOU TOLD A STORY

19
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:40,026
ABOUT ME AND ALL THE YEARS WE

20
00:00:40,026 --> 00:00:41,694
HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER.

00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:42,295
GO AHEAD.

00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:46,699
>> I AM ALWAYS SURPRISED THAT

24
00:00:46,699 --> 00:00:49,769
YOU ARE UPSET BY THAT.

25
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:51,571
IT'S THE MOST CHARMING STORY.

26
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:52,838
AS YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU AGAIN ON

27
00:00:52,838 --> 00:00:55,374
A SPECIAL THAT BRET BAIER DID,

HE PROMPTED ME, HE WAS SORT OF

29
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,978
THE PROVOCATEUR THERE.

30
00:00:58,978 --> 00:01:00,146
I SAID, SEAN DOESN'T REALLY LIKE

31
00:01:00,146 --> 00:01:02,615
IT BUT IT'S A WONDERFUL STORY.

32
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:05,384
IT JUST SHOWS, I LIKE IT BECAUSE

33
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:10,056
IT SHOWS HOW I HAVEN'T MADE

34
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:11,157
BEING IN A WHEELCHAIR THE CENTER

35
00:01:11,157 --> 00:01:13,359
OF MY LIFE AND THE FACT THAT YOU

00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,560
EVEN WEREN'T AWARE OF IT I

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,561
THOUGHT WAS LOVELY.

38
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,063
IT WAS A WAY TO COMPLIMENT YOU.

BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, BUT THE

42
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:23,769
STORY IS REALLY INSPIRING.

43
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:24,503
