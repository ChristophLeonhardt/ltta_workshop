parents are so nervous that they don't know enough they're afraid that they're going to mess up their kids the important thing is you as the grown-ups need to take charge of this I think the biggest mistake is expressing their anxiety about it like ah I'm not good at this or oh I blew my you know cash advance and when I was 23 years old and then you know went to Paris which is what a lot of my friends did and I think that although we may have money baggage I've met so many people say you know I'm really bad at money because my parents were really bad at money other people say I'm really bad at money because my parents were too good with money and they were so careful and trivial and now I want to spend it myself the point is that it doesn't matter what your psychology of money is in the sense that you want to just help your kids understand how to stay out of debt not to get into credit card debt or how to save money for the future or even invest it is simpler than people think but you don't want to express all that fear remember somebody was told me when my son was little to pretend to love bugs because he was really into science they don't like that we would love to dig in the dirt and I realized okay that makes sense pretend or at least be cool with it so that they'll know that it's something that you're sharing with them and they'll pick it up too you
