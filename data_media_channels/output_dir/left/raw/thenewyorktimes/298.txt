1
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,240
NRATV is a relatively

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,990
new online platform for
the nation’s foremost gun rights

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,230
organization to disseminate its
views, from gun safety to gun

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,370
culture to, most crucially,
the politics of gun ownership,

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,225
especially around large,
mass casualty events.

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,670
What you saw happen
almost immediately

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:41,370
after the Florida shooting
was N.R.A. hosts on NRATV talking

8
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,680
about how the
mainstream media was

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,760
lying to you about the role
of the N.R.A. in the shooting.

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,100
“The headlines are nothing
short of despicable.

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,420
Look at this one: ‘Trained by
the N.R.A.,’ writes The Daily News.”

12
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,750
Essentially, what’s
played out on NRATV

13
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,790
is a political campaign
to stifle any efforts

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:05,331
at rewriting gun laws before
they get off the ground.

15
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,290
“But no new law would have
stopped this monster,

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,530
that’s a fact. We need
more good guys with guns

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,070
around because seconds
count in these situations.”

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,050
“You want to protect
our kids or not?

19
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,940
Or you want to jerk around?”

20
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,060
Interestingly, a lot of the
stories that they cover

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,130
have nothing to do
with guns at all.

22
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,550
“Dana, phony fake frauds are
what I call the leaders

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,880
of these women’s marches.”

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,570
“It’s an exclusive little clique
of far left Shariah apologists. ...”

25
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,200
If what the N.R.A. is
doing with NRATV is trying

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,670
to reach as broad an audience
possible, then they need to make

27
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,130
their programming tailored to
issues that aren’t as specific

28
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,430
and niche as guns.

29
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,650
“To those who bring bias
and propaganda to CNN,

30
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,700
The Washington Post
and The New York Times,

31
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,050
your time is running out.”

32
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,940
“You put the lies
of Colin Kaepernick

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,630
on a pedestal. You celebrate
his hatred of our police.”

34
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,830
It’s going to be political,
it’s going to be entertainment.

35
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,150
“This is it — the big final test.”

36
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,830
It’s going to be informative.

37
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,200
Sometimes a mix of
all of those things.

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,640
So one example is
this show called

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,900
“Noir,” which is hosted by
a former Navy SEAL named Dom,

40
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,550
who shows you various techniques
at fighting off bad guys

41
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,910
with your pistol.

42
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,310
But then, of course, it’s
also highly politically

43
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,750
and racially charged.

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,360
You have the element
of crime. In this case

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,970
perpetrated by an
African-American man

46
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,370
against a white woman.

47
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:48,950
“I would never tell
a law-abiding citizen

48
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,510
to outsource their personal
safety to the government

49
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,510
anyway.”

50
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,820
You know, the N.R.A.
wouldn’t talk to us

51
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,900
on the record for this story.

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:04,540
So it’s hard to know what its
reach with NRATV really is.

53
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,420
There’s a big potential
to reach a lot of people.

54
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,690
“Wave it proudly.

55
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,050
If people take a knee,
drown out their disrespect

56
00:03:15,050 --> 00:00:00,000
with a unified roaring
chant of U.S.A., U.S.A.”
