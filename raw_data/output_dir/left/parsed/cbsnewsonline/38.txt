USA 
>> HELLO MISSISSIPPI, HELLO.
BEAUTIFUL.
WELL, I HAVE TO SAY BY SAYING
THAT 2020 IS LOOKING REALLY
EASY, ISN'T IT?
>> I THINK THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA
BACK THERE IS STARTING TO GET
IT, FOLKS.
I THINK THEY'RE STARTING.
THEY'RE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON.
AND I'M THRILLED TO BE BACK IN
THIS GREAT STATE WITH THOUSANDS
OF PROUD, LOYAL, HARDWORKING
AMERICAN PATRIOTS.
THANK YOU.
IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS WE'VE
ACHIEVED THE BIGGEST COMEBACK IN
AMERICAN HISTORY.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENED.
THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING.
WAGES ARE RISING.
AND MORE AMERICANS ARE WORKING
TODAY THAN EVER BEFORE TODAY.
EVER BEFORE.
THINK OF THAT.
NOW, JUST THINK OF THAT.
TODAY WE HAVE MORE AMERICANS
WORKING THAN WE'VE EVER HAD IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY RIGHT
NOW TODAY.
HOW GREAT IS THAT, RIGHT?
WE'RE DEFENDING OUR SECOND
AMENDMENT, PROTECTING RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY, TAKING CARE OF OUR
GREAT VETERANS, AND REBUILDING
AMERICA'S MILITARY LIKE IT
HASN'T BEEN REBUILT EVER BEFORE.
THIS WEEK WE MADE HISTORY AGAIN
WHEN I ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE
REPLACING THE JOB KILLING
DISASTER KNOWN AS NAFTA WITH A
BRAND NEW U.S.-MEXICO-CANADA
TRADE AGREEMENT.
A GOOD ONE.
AND IT'S A GOOD ONE.
WE'RE CALLING IT USMCA.
YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THAT NAME.
THAT'LL BECOME A PART OF YOUR
VOCABULARY.
USMCA.
COMPANIES AREN'T GOING TO BE
LEAVING US ANYMORE, AND FIRING
EVERYBODY AND SENDING THEIR
PRODUCT BACK INTO THE UNITED
STATES WITH NO TAX.
THAT WAS WHAT I WANTED.
>> YOU KNOW, MISSISSIPPI, WHEN
THEY LEAVE AND THEY GO NEXT DOOR
AND THEY FIRE EVERYBODY AND THEY
BUILD THE PRODUCT AND SEND IT
BACK AND SELL IT TO THE SAME
PEOPLE THAT WERE BUYING IT
BEFORE.
NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
ANYMORE.
SO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT
ANYMORE.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD -- THAT'S NOT
A GOOD THING TO DO, ALTHOUGH
THERE IS A GROUP CALLED
GLOBALISTS, THEY THINK IT'S JUST
FINE.
NOT FINE.
THE GLOBALISTS.
THE GLOBALISTS.
WE DON'T LIKE THE THINKING OF
THE GLOBALISTS.
THE USMCA IS AN INCREDIBLE
VICTORY FOR OUR FARMERS, OUR
RANCHERS, OUR FACTORY WORKERS,
AND OUR ENTIRE NATION.
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN AND
AMERICA IS BEING RESPECTED
AGAIN.
MAYBE RESPECTED LIKE NEVER
BEFORE BECAUSE WE ARE FINALLY
PUTTING AMERICA FIRST.
BUT EXACTLY FIVE WEEKS FROM
TODAY ALL OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY
PROGRESS IS AT STAKE.
IT IS AT STAKE.
I'M NOT ON THE BALLOT.
BUT IN A CERTAIN WAY I'M ON THE
BALLOT, SO PLEASE GO OUT AND
VOTE.
GO OUT AND VOTE.
ON NOVEMBER 6TH, YOU WILL HEAD
TO THE POLLS, HOPEFULLY, IN ONE
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS OF OUR
LIFETIME.
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE DEMOCRAT
IS IF YOU ARE TIRED OF WINNING.
A DEMOCRAT TAKEOVER OF CONGRESS
WILL PLUNGE OUR COUNTRY INTO
GRIDLOCK AND CHAOS LIKE YOU
HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE.
IT'LL COME TO A HALT.
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, ALL OF
THOSE PEOPLE WITH YOUR SAVINGS
ACCOUNTS AND YOUR MONEY PILED UP
IN YOUR BANK, IT'S ALL -- A LOT
OF IT'S GOING TO DISAPPEAR.
AND IT'LL DISAPPEAR REALLY FAST.
YOUR 401Ks.
I STAND UP ALL THE TIME WITH
GREAT AMERICANS, SURE, I'D LIKE
TO THANK YOU.
MY WIFE THINKS I'M ONE OF THE
GREATEST INVESTORS IN THE WORLD.
AND TWO YEARS AGO SHE THOUGHT I
WAS A TOTAL LOSER, SIR.
NOW SHE LOVES ME SO MUCH.
BECAUSE MY 401K HAS GONE UP 55%,
SIR, SINCE YOU GOT ELECTED.
55%.
OH, IT'S AMAZING.
YOU CAN REALLY GET YOUR WIFE TO
LIKE YOU A LOT IF THAT HAPPENS.
YOU GOT TO BE REALLY BAD, I TELL
YOU.
AND THAT'S HAPPENING.
AND IT GOES THE OTHER WAY TOO.
THAT HAPPENS.
PEOPLE ARE GENIUSES NOW.
AND WE'VE HELPED.
YOU KNOW?
WE HAD PROBABLY AND EVEN THE
FAKE NEWS WOULD TELL YOU THE
GREATEST VICTORY IN THE HISTORY
OF THIS COUNTRY IN 2016.
THERE'S NEVER BEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THAT.
>> THE PEOPLE CAME FROM THE
HILLS AND THE VALLEYS.
THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER.
THEY VOTED VOTED VOTED.
AND THEY LOVED TRUMP.
THEY LOVED US.
BECAUSE IT WASN'T ME.
IT WAS ALL OF US.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.
BUT IT'S ALL FRAGILE, THE
DEMOCRATS WILL OPEN OUR BORDERS
TO DEADLY DOCTORINGS AND
RUTHLESS -- DRUGS AND RUTHLESS
GANGS.
THE DEMOCRATS, AND I SAY THIS,
AND I'VE DEALT WITH IT, THE
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF
CRIME.
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.
THEY'RE PARTY OF CRIME.
RADICAL DEMOCRATS WANT TO TEAR
DOWN OUR LAWS, TEAR DOWN OUR
INSTITUTIONS IN PURSUIT OF
POWER, DEMOLISH OUR PROSPERITY
IN THE NAME OF SOCIALISM AND
PROBABLY WORSE, AND ABOLISH OUR
BORDERS THIS THE SERVICE OF
GLOBALISM.
THERE IS NOTHING DEMOCRATS
AREN'T WILLING TO DO, AND YOU'RE
SEEING IT DAY BY DAY.
AND YOU'VE SEEN ET MORE IN THE
LAST WEEK THAN YOU'VE EVER SEEN
IT BEFORE.
AND NOW ONE -- NO ONE, JUST
THINK OF THIS, NO ONE UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES IS ALLOWED TO
SPEAK UP IF YOU'RE ON THIS SIDE
OF THE EQUATION.
BUT GUESS WHAT?
WE'RE SPEAKING UP LIKE NOBODY
HAS EVER SPOKEN UP BEFORE.
THEY WANT TO GET THE THAT
THEY SO DESPERATELY -- THEY WANT
TO GET THE POWER THAT THEY SO
DESPERATELY CRAVE THAT WAS TAKEN
AWAY FROM THEM.
ALL THE DEMOCRATS KNOW, AND ALL
THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IS DESTRUCT,
DEMOLISH, DESTROY, AND DELAY.
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO DESTROY
JUDGE KAVANAUGH SINCE THE VERY
FIRST SECOND HE WAS ANNOUNCED.
BECAUSE THEY KNOW JUDGE
KAVANAUGH WILL FOLLOW THE
CONSTITUTION AS WRITTEN.
>> WE LOVE KAVANAUGH.
WE LOVE KAVANAUGH.
WE LOVE KAVANAUGH.
WE LOVE KAVANAUGH.
>> YOU KNOW, FOR TEN YEARS, I
DON'T KNOW HIM, I NEVER MET HIM.
BUT I'VE BEEN HEARING THERE'S
THIS GUY NAMED BRETT KAVANAUGH
WHO IS LIKE A PERFECT PERSON
WHO'S DESTINED FOR THE SUPREME
COURT.
I'VE HEARD THAT FOR A LONG TIME.
AND LOT OF SMART PEOPLE.
AND FIRST IN HIS CLASS AT YALE.
IN HIS CLASS AT -- TOP
TOP IN HIS CLASS AT LAW SCHOOL.
HE'S LED A LIFE THAT'S
UNBELIEVABLE.
HE'S HAD NO PROBLEMS.
THEY'VE NEVER TAKEN HIM OUT OF
RESTAURANTS.
THIS IS LIKE A PERSON THAT
EVERYBODY THOUGHT AT THE HIGHEST
LEVEL ON BOTH SIDES, THEY SAID
SOMEDAY HE WILL BE A SUPREME
COURT JUDGE, RIGHT?
HE WILL BE A JUSTICE OF THE
SUPREME COURT.
AND ALL MY LIFE I'VE HEARD THAT
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT A
PRESIDENT HAS TO DO AS PRESIDENT
IS THE APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME
COURT JUSTICE.
AND I DISAGREE.
I THINK WAR, I THINK OUR
MILITARY, I THINK PEACE, I THINK
THOSE THINGS ARE, YOU KNOW,
THOSE THINGS ARE PRETTY
IMPORTANT.
IT'S PRETTY IMPORTANT.
THEY DON'T SAY THAT.
BUT I SAY THOSE THINGS ARE
PRETTY IMPORTANT.
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, THE
APPOINTMENT OF A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE AND I LOOK AT HIM, AND I
LOOK AT THE MAN I APPOINTED JUST
BEFORE HIM, JUSTICE NEIL
GORSUCH.
>> WHO WAS PUT THROUGH THE
PACES, BUT NOTHING LIKE WHAT'S
HAPPENING NOW.
IT'S JUST CRAZED.
IT'S CRAZY.
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.
GANG RAPE, A GANG RAPE.
MANY TIMES.
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE.
SO MANY DIFFERENT CHARGES.
GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT
THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
AND I HAVE IT MYSELF ALL THE
TIME.
BUT FOR ME IT'S LIKE A PART OF
THE JOB DESCRIPTION.
LET IT HAPPEN TO ME.
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HIM.
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HIM.
WHAT HE'S GOING THROUGH, 36
YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENED.
I HAD ONE BEER, RIGHT?
I HAD ONE BEER.
WELL -- NOPE, IT WAS ONE BEER.
HOW DID YOU GET HOME?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
WHERE IS THE PLACE?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD WAS IT AND I
DON'T KNOW, WHERE'S THE HOUSE, I
DON'T KNOW.
UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, WHERE WAS
IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I HAD ONE BEER.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I
REMEMBER.
AND A MAN'S LIFE IS IN TATTERS.
A MAN'S LIFE IS SHATTERED.
HIS WIFE IS SHATTERED.
HIS DAUGHTERS WHO ARE BEAUTIFUL,
INCREDIBLE YOUNG KIDS THEY
DESTROY PEOPLE.
THEY WANT TO DESTROY PEOPLE.
THESE ARE REALLY EVIL PEOPLE.
AND THEN YOU SEE THE PEOPLE THAT
ARE DOING IT.
I KNOW EVERY ONE.
I COULD TELL YOU THINGS ABOUT
EVERY ONE OF THEM.
DA NANG, RICHARD BLUMENTHAL.
THIS GUY LIED ABOUT HIS SERVICE.
HE DIDN'T JUST SAY, GEE, I WAS
IN THE SERVICE.
NO.
HE SAID I WAS IN THE MARINES.
DA NANG PROVINCE.
SOLDIERS DYING LEFT AND RIGHT AS
WE BATTLED UP THE HILL.
THIS WENT ON FOR 15 YEARS WHEN
HE WAS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF
CONNECTICUT.
I THOUGHT HE WAS A GREAT WAR
HERO.
AND THEN IT TURNED OUT HE WAS
NEVER IN VIETNAM.
HE WAS IN THE RESERVES.
AND I WATCHED HIM TWO DAYS AGO,
I WATCHED HIM SAYING WE NEED THE
TRUTH.
IF WE DON'T HAVE -- AND HERE'S A
GUY WHO IS SAYING PEOPLE WERE
DYING ALL AROUND HIM AND HE WAS
NEVER THERE.
AND THEN HE CRIED WHEN THEY
CAUGHT HIM.
HE CRIED LIKE A BABY, LIKE A
BABY.
WHEN JIMMY SWAGGER TRIED, IT WAS
NOTHING COMPARED TO DA NANG
RICHARD, NOTHING.
JIMMY SWAGGERT WAS NOTHING.
HE ONLY LIED FOR 15 YEARS AND
NOW HE GETS UP.
AND NOW HE TALKS ABOUT LYING.
AND THIS MAN'S NOT LYING.
SO BLUMENTHAL IS A FRAUD.
HE'S A FRAUD.
AND THE REASON HE GOT ELECTED IS
BECAUSE IN CONNECTICUT IT'S
IMPOSSIBLE FOR A REPUBLICAN TO
GET ELECTED.
AND I DID WELL THERE.
BUT YOU CAN'T.
HE ACTUALLY GAVE UP THE RACE.
YOU THOUGHT HE LOST.
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
HE STOPPED CAMPAIGNING.
IT WAS OVER.
AND THEN HE WON BY THREE POINTS.
AND WE HAVE HIM IN THE SENATE.
AND NOW HE'S THIS GREAT,
HONORABLE GUY.
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHY?
THE FAKE NEWS DOESN'T EVER WANT
TO PUT THAT STUFF ON.
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
IT.
THEY DON'T EVER WANT TO PUT IT
ON.
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF FAKERS.
AND THEN YOU HAVE CORY BOOKER,
RIGHT?
CORY BOOKER.
HERE'S A GUY WHO DESTROYED
PRACTICALLY BY HIMSELF THE CITY
OF NEWARK, NEW JERSEY.
HE WAS SUCH A BAD MAYOR.
AND SEE WHAT HE WROTE HIMSELF
ABOUT WOMEN.
CHECK IT OUT, FOLKS.
CHECK IT OUT.
THAT HE TALKS HOW DARE YOU TREAT
A WOMAN LIKE THAT.
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THIS GUY
WROTE.
AND I KNOW ABOUT EVERY ONE OF
THEM.
I COULD GO ON AND ON.
HOW ABOUT FEINSTEIN?
HOW ABOUT HER?
WE NEED MORE TIME FOR THE FBI.
THE FBI HAS TO DO A MORE
THOROUGH SEARCH.
WE HAD ANOTHER WOMAN JUST
REPORTED BY A SLEAZE BAG LAWYER
NAMED AVENUE NATTY -- AVENUE --
AVENUE NAT
NATTY -- EVEN NBC COULDN'T
SHIELD HER WITH THAT INTERVIEW.
THIS WOMAN HAD NO CLUE WHAT WAS
GOING ON.
NO CLUE.
AND YET SHE MADE THE MOST
HORRIBLE CHARGES AGAINST A
NUMBER ONE IN HIS CLASS AT YALE,
PERFECT HUMAN BEING.
GREAT FATHER, GREAT HUSBAND.
THIS IS A GREAT PERSON.
AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING WELL MAYBE
IT'S TRUE.
AND BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT
MAYBE IT'S TRUE HE SHOULD NOT
BECOME A UNITED STATES SUPREME
COURT JUSTICE.
HOW HORRIBLE IS THIS?
HOW HORRIBLE IS THIS?
SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME FOR
OUR COUNTRY.
THIS IS A TIME WHEN YOUR FATHER,
WHEN YOUR HUSBAND, WHEN YOUR
BROTHER, WHEN YOUR SON COULD DO
GREAT.
MOM, I DID GREAT IN SCHOOL.
I'VE WORKED SO HARD.
MOM, I'M SO PLEASED TO TELL YOU
I JUST GOT A FANTASTIC JOB WITH
IBM.
I JUST GOT A FANTASTIC JOB WITH
GENERAL MOTORS.
I JUST GOT, I'M SO PROUD.
MOM, A TERRIBLE THING JUST
HAPPENED.
A PERSON WHO I'VE NEVER MET SAID
THAT I DID THINGS THAT WERE
HORRIBLE.
AND THEY'RE FIRING ME FROM MY
JOB, MOM.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
MOM, WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT DO I DO, MOM?
WHAT DO I DO, MOM?
IT'S A SAD SITUATION, OKAY?
AND WE BETTER START AS A CO
GETTING SMART AND GETTING TOUGH
AND NOT LETTING THAT STUFF RIGHT
BACK THERE ALL THOSE CAMERAS
TELL US HOW TO LIVE OUR LIVES.
BECAUSE THEY ARE REALLY
DISHONEST PEOPLE.
NOT ALL OF THEM, BUT WELL
MOST OF THEM.
THAT I CAN TELL YOU.
FAKE NEWS.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING TO THINK
ABOUT, RIGHT?
THAT'S SOMETHING.
THINK OF YOUR SON.
THINK OF YOUR HUSBAND.
I'VE HAD MANY FALSE ACCUSATIONS.
I'VE HAD IT -- I'VE HAD SO MANY.
AND WHEN I SAY IT DIDN'T HAPPEN,
NOBODY BELIEVES ME.
BUT IT'S ME.
IT'S MY JOB DESCRIPTION.
IT'S TRUMP, IT'S OKAY.
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.
THEY CAN SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT
ABOUT ME, IT'S FINE.
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE WORST LIABLE
LAWS ANYWHERE IN THE -- LIBEL
LAWS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
IF YOU'RE FAMOUS YOU CAN'T SUE.
FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.
BUT TAKE PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST
OUTSTANDING HAVE JUST HAD GREAT
LIVES, AND THAT LIFE DOESN'T
EAN A THING.
AND YOU NOTICE WITH THE JUDGE
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT HIS LAST
35 YEARS.
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT WHAT --
EVERYBODY KNOWS HIM.
HE'S A WELL KNOWN, HIGHLY
RESPECTED PERSON.
UNTIL THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS
BECAUSE THEY'RE DESTROYING HIM
AND THEY'RE DESTROYING HIS
REPUTATION AND WE CAN'T LET THAT
HAPPEN.
WE CAN'T.
CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN.
>> AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM,
FOLKS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.
I MET HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME A
FEW WEEKS AGO.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO PROTECT
MY FRIEND.
I WANT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT FOR
THIS COUNTRY.
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR
COUNTRY.
VERY IMPORTANT THING.
VERY IMPORTANT TIME IN OUR
COUNTRY.
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS BECOME
TOO EXTREME.
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF IT.
AND TOO DANGEROUS TO BE TRUSTED
WITH POWER.
THAT IS WHY YOU MUST VOTE
REPUBLICAN ON ELECTION DAY.
AND YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND VOTE.
I'M LISTENING TO COMMENTATORS.
THEY'RE SAYING IF TRUMP IS
RUNNING HE'S GOING TO BEAT
EVERYBODY.
THEY'RE SAYING THAT.
AND I DREAM ABOUT ALL THESE
PEOPLE, BIDEN, THE GUY WHO NEVER
HAD MORE THAN 1% IN A POLL WHEN
HE WAS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND
THEN OBAMA TOOK HIM OFF THE
TRASH HEAP.
I HEAR BIDEN WANTS TO TAKE ME TO
THE BACK OF A BARN.
HE WOULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE, I
WILL TELL YOU.
REMEMBER HE SAID THAT?
I'D LIKE TO TAKE HIM.
YOU KNOW, WITH BIDEN YOU GO LIKE
THIS.
AND HE GOES DOWN.
BIDEN AND THE OTHER ONES.
BUT THEY SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP
ISN'T RUNNING, SO WILL THE
PEOPLE GO OUT AND VOTE?
YOU GOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE.
AND THEY SAY THAT DONALD TRUMP
DOESN'T LIKE CONGRESS.
I REALLY DO.
I LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN
CONGRESS.
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN SOME OF
THEM.
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING, WE HAVE THE RIGHT
IDEAS, WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT
THING.
WE NEED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES.
THEY SAY WE HAVE A MAJORITY.
WE BARELY HAVE -- IF SOMEBODY
HAS A COLD AND STAYS HOME, WE
DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY.
THAT'S HOW BAD IT IS.
REPUBLICANS HAVE TO GO OUT AND
VOTE.
THEY SAY IF I WAS ON THE TICKET
EVERYBODY WOULD GO.
IT WOULD BE A LANDSLIDE.
EVEN THE FAKERS BACK THERE, THEY
SAY THAT.
AND I'M NOT ON THE TICKET, BUT I
AM ON THE TICKET.
BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO A
REFERENDUM ABOUT ME AND THE
DISGUSTING GRIDLOCK THAT THEY'LL
PUT THIS COUNTRY THROUGH.
THINK OF IT.
WE HAVE THE GREATEST ECONOMY IN
HISTORY.
WE HAVE A MILITARY THAT WILL
SOON BE THE STRONGEST WE'VE EVER
HAD.
OUR COUNTRY IS DOING SO WELL.
AND THEN WE HAVE A MAXINE WATERS
SAYING WE HAVE TO GET RID OF
HIM.
WE HAVE TO GET RID OF HIM.
MAXINE WATERS.
AND NANCY PELOSI.
SHE'S ANOTHER BEAUTY.
GET OUT AND VOTE.
I WANT YOU TO VOTE.
PRETEND I'M ON THE BALLOT.
AND DON'T WORRY, WE'LL BE ON THE
BALLOT IN TWO YEARS AND WE WILL
DO A LANDSLIDE LIKE YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE.
A COUPLE OF THE REPORTERS I SEE
BACK THERE, THEY SAID, OH, TRUMP
IS RUNNING.
I MUST SAY, ONE OF THEM SAID,
RIGHT AFTER I ANNOUNCED, JUNE
16TH.
IT WAS A SUNDAY MORNING SHOW,
AND ONE OF THEM SAID, YOU KNOW,
HE'S GOING TO WIN, DON'T YOU?
AND ANOTHER ONE THAT'S BACK
THERE NOW, WHO'S LOOKING VERY
WELL, SAID ALONG WITH THE HOST
OH OH OH, YOU'RE ONLY KIDDING.
HE'S DOING THIS FOR FUN.
YOU THINK THIS IS FUN ?
YEAH, ACTUALLY IT'S SORT -- FUN?
YEAH, ACTUALLY IT'S SORT OF FUN.
YES, IT IS.
FOR ME IT'S FUN.
FOR ME IT'S FUN.
YOU KNOW WHY IT'S FUN?
BECAUSE WE'RE ACHIEVING OUR
GOALS BETTER THAN ANYONE THOUGHT
POSSIBLE.
THAT'S WHY IT'S FUN.
IF I WASN'T IT WOULDN'T BE FUN.
BUT THIS ONE PARTICULAR
REPORTER.
SHE SAID OH OH OH, YOU'RE ONLY
KIDDING, RIGHT?
HA HA, THAT'S SO FUNNY.
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET ON
ELECTION NIGHT.
DONALD TRUMP IS YOUR NEXT
PRESIDENT, FOLKS.
AND IT'S DRIVING THEM CRAZY.
SO WE'RE THRILLED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.
AND I AM HAVING A LOT OF FUN.
BUT IT IS TRUE, I'M HAVING FUN
BECAUSE NOBODY EVER WOULD HAVE
BELIEVED IN A MILLION YEARS THAT
WE WOULD HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED.
NOBODY HAS ACCOMPLISHED MORE IN
TWO YEARS.
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE FIRST TWO
YEARS OF ANY -- NOBODY HAS EVEN
COME CLOSE TO ACCOMPLISHING WHAT
WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED.
AND I'M DOING IT FOR YOU, AND
WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER BECAUSE
THIS IS A WHOLE THING THAT HAS
NEVER HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY
BEFORE.
YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING.
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED THERE WERE
A LOT OF PEOPLE ALWAYS SHOWING
UP.
AND BY THE WAY, YOU THINK THIS
IS A BIG CROWD IN HERE.
THIS PLACE IS PACKED, RIGHT?
AND IF THERE WAS ONE EMPTY SEAT,
THEY WOULD SAY, AS "THE
WASHINGTON POST" DID SAY, "THE
WASHINGTON POST" CAME, YOU SAW
THAT, RIGHT?
CAME TO AN ARENA SOMEPLACE, FOUR
HOURS EARLY, AND THEY HBT
STARTED LETTING -- HADN'T
STARTED LETTING THE PEOPLE IN
YET.
AND HE PUT A PICTURE OF AN
ARENA.
THERE WERE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE OUTSIDE WAITING TO COME
IN.
"THE WASHINGTON POST" PUT A
PICTURE OF AN EMPTY ARENA AND
THEY PUT A CAPTION TO THE EFFECT
MR. PRESIDENT, NOT A VERY GOOD
CROWD, IS IT?
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
AND THEY HAD A PICTURE UP OF AN
EMPTY ARENA.
I DIDN'T EVEN LAND FOR FOUR AND
A HALF HOURS LATER.
AND WHEN I LANDED THAT PLACE WAS
JUST LIKE THIS.
IT WAS PACKED WITH THOUSANDS OF
PEOPLE OUTSIDE.
NOW, DID THEY FIRE THAT
REPORTER?
NO.
DID THEY FIRE THAT REPORTER?
NO.
RIGHT?
THEY -- ISN'T IT INCREDIBLE?
ISN'T IT SAD?
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO
ROSEANNE.
DID THEY FIRE ROSEANNE, YES.
NO, BUT THINK OF IT.
PUTS A PICTURE OF AN EMPTY, 5%.
PEOPLE WERE JUST STARTING 20
TRICKLE IN.
AND SAID NOT A VERY GOOD CROWD
MR. PRESIDENT.
THERE WAS NO GAMES.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THAT
NIGHT?
PEOPLE THAT WERE SITTING ON
STAIRWELLS, PEOPLE THAT COULDN'T
GET A SEAT, PEOPLE THAT WERE
HERE ONLY BECAUSE THE
MARSHALS WERE SO INCREDIBLE,
SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO
COME IN.
THOUSANDS OUTSIDE.
THEY SAID THIS IS A FRAUD BY
"THE WASHINGTON POST."
I WAS
THERE.
THERE WERE NO EMPTY SEATS.
WE SET A RECORD THAT EVENING FOR
CROWD ATTENDANCE.
BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED MUCH OF A
STAGE.
BASKETBALL THEY NEED A BIG --
YOU'RE FILLED UP WITH PEOPLE
LIKE IT IS TONIGHT.
AND WE BARELY GOT AN APOLOGY.
HE ADMITTED HE WAS WRONG.
YOU KNOW WHERE HE DID IT?
ON HIS LITTLE TWITTER ACCOUNT.
AND THAT KIND OF DISHONESTY
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
HAPPENED AT THE INAUGURATION.
IT HAPPENED AT THE INAUGURATION.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
THESE ARE VERY VERY DISHONEST
PEOPLE.
WE ARE THRILLED TO BE JOINED
TONIGHT BY SEVERAL GREAT
REPUBLICAN LEADERS.
AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A
FRIEND OF MINE WHO'S A VERY
SPECIAL MAN.
VERY SPECIAL.
HE'S A GREAT GOVERNOR, DONE A
FANTASTIC JOB.
HE CALLED ME.
HE BUILT THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
MUSEUM, CALLED ME.
WE WENT THERE.
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.
I WAS AT THE OPENING.
WE CUT THE RIBBON.
GOVERNOR PHIL BRYANT, GOVERNOR?

GREAT HEART AND GREAT BRAIN.
SAY A FEW WORDS.
>> THANK YOU.
ARE WE PROUD TO HAVE DONALD J.
TRUMP HERE IN MISSISSIPPI?
ALL RIGHT, I WON'T GET STARTED
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT, THIS
MAN HAS DONE MORE AS PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES IN TWO
YEARS THAN ANY PRESIDENT THAT I
CAN EVER REMEMBER OR EVER
STUDIED ABOUT.
HE IS A REMARKABLE MAN.
THAT IS MAKING AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.

BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN WARRIORS.
THEY'VE BEEN FRIEND.
THEY HELPED ME WITH THE --
FRIENDS.
THEY HELPED ME WITH THE BIGGEST
TAX CUTS IN OUR COUNTRY.
THE GREAT REGULATION CUTS WHICH
COULD BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT,
FRANKLY, THAN THE TAX CUTS IF
YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH
BECAUSE IT MEANS JOBS.
BUT YOU HAVE SOME GREAT
CONGRESSMEN, TRENT KELLEY.
TRENT, THANK YOU.
GREG HARPER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AND DAVID KOSTOFF.
THANK YOU, DAVID.
THERE'S ANOTHER WARRIOR IN THE
ROOM.

IF YOU'RE NOT A WARRIOR YOU JUST
GO HOME, GO TO THE CORNER, PUT
YOUR THUMB IN YOUR MOUTH, AND
SAY MOMMY, TAKE ME HOME.

FRIEND OF MINE AND HAS ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR ME, SENATOR ROGER
WICKER.

WHAT A GREAT GUY.
HE'S DOING GREAT.
HE'S WINNING BY A LOT BUT GET

PERSON WE ARE ALL HERE TONIGHT
TO SUPPORT.
A TRUE MISSISSIPPI PATRIOT.
SENATOR CINDY HYDE-SMITH.
CINDY, COME UP.
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT.
AND I TOLD HIM HE WOULD GET A
WARM MISSISSIPPI WELCOME.
AND YOU DID NOT DISAPPOINT.
YES.
WE ARE THE HOSPITALITY STATE.
MR. PRESIDENT, I TELL YOU IT IS
SUCH AN HONOR TO WORK WITH THIS
MAN.
IS HE NOT THE BEST PRESIDENT WE
HAVE EVER HAD?
THIS IS WONDERFUL.
YOU KNOW, EARLY ON, I WAS A
SUPPORTER OF THEN CANDIDATE
DONALD J. TRUMP.
AND I WAS ON HIS ADVISORY
COMMITTEE.
AND NOW EVERY TIME I WALK ON TO
THE SENATE FLOOR I WANT TO HELP
PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.
IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO WORK WITH
A MAN THAT I TELL YOU HE LOVES
THE VETERANS.
HE LOVES THE MILITARY.
AND HE LOVES OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT
AS WELL.
YOU KNOW, THIS PAST WEEK -- THIS
PAST WEEK IN BROOKHAVEN,
MISSISSIPPI, MY HOMETOWN, WE HAD
TWO OFFICERS SHOT DOWN THIS PAST
WEEKEND.
AND I WAS ABLE TO TELL HIM ABOUT
THAT.
JAMES WHITE AND ZACH MOKE, AND
THEN THE NEXT DAY WE HAD A
MISSISSIPPI HIGHWAY PATROL
TROOPER, JOSH SMITH, SHOT DOWN.
AND I'M JUST GOING TO ASK YOU TO
REMEMBER THOSE PEOPLE IN YOUR
PRAYERS AS WE CONTINUE ON WITH
THIS.
WE'VE HAD A TRAGIC WEEK IN
MISSISSIPPI WITH OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT.
BUT THIS MAN SUPPORTS LAW
ENFORCEMENT 100%.
I JUST WANT TO THANK OUR GREAT
GOVERNOR PHIL BRYANT FOR MAKING
YOU OUR U.S. SENATOR, TO APPOINT
ME TO THAT, AN OPPORTUNITY OF
THREE LIFETIMES, OTHER THAN
BEING THE MOTHER OF ANNA MICHAEL
SMITH AND THE WIFE OF MICHAEL
SMITH, IT'S THE GREATEST
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF MY LIFE.
WHAT A TREAT TO SERVE WITH
SENATOR WICKER.
HE'S BEEN A FRIEND TO ME ON THE
SENATE FLOOR NO DOUBT.
I TELL YOU.
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS SWORN IN AS
YOUR U.S. SENATOR, VICE
PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE HE PUT THIS
PIN RIGHT HERE ON ME.
AND HE SAID CINDY, THIS PIN WILL
GET YOU IN ANY DOOR IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THIS
ISN'T MY PIN, THIS IS YOUR PIN.
THIS IS MISSISSIPPI'S PIN.
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
THIS MAN IS LEADING THE CHARGE.
WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK ON AIR
FORCE ONE AND WE'RE DOING BACK
TO WASHINGTON BECAUSE, YOU KNOW
WHAT?
WE'VE GOT A SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE TO GET CONFIRMED.
WE'VE GOT HIM SO I'M GOING TO
ASK THE YOUR PRAYERS ALSO FOR
THE -- FOR YOUR PRAYERS ALSO FOR
THE KAVANAUGH FAMILY.
MY CONTINUED PRAYER IS THAT GOD
CONTINUES TO BLESS THESE GREAT
STATES 206 UNITED STATES.
-- THESE GREATS STATES OF THE
UNITED STATES.
>> THANK YOU, CINDY.
THANK YOU, CINDY.

YOU KNOW WE HAD A GREAT FRIEND
IN THE SENATE.
AND DID A FANTASTIC JOB.
AND IT WAS JUST HIS TIME.
HE CALLED ME.
IT WAS HIS TIME.
YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT,
WONDERFUL MAN.
AND HE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO APPOINT SOMEBODY.
AND I WENT TO PHIL.
I SAID PHIL, WHO'S THE BEST?
AND PHIL HAD NO DOUBT IN HIS
MIND THAT'S WHO HE RECOMMENDED.
AND SINCE THEN CINDY HAS VOTED
WITH ME 100% OF THE TIME.
SHE'S ALWAYS HAD MY BACK.
SHE'S ALWAYS HAD YOUR BACK.
AND A VOTE FOR CINDY IS A VOTE
FOR ME AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
AND A VOTE FOR CINDY'S OPPONENT,
MIKE ESPY, IS A VOTE FOR CHUCK
SCHUMER, NANCY PELOSI, AND THE
LEGENDARY LOW IQ PERSON, MAXINE
WATERS.
THAT'S WHY SCHUMER'S PACK IS
FUNDING MIKE ESPY WITH A LOT OF
MONEY.
A VOTE FOR ESP XRSHGS IS A VOTE
FOR THE DEM -- ESPY IS A VOTE
FOR DEMOCRATS TO OPEN BORDERS
AND RADICAL SOCIALISM.
WHEN ESPY WAS IN CONGRESS HE
SPONSORED LEGISLATION ALONGSIDE
NANCY PELOSI.
THAT'S JUST WHAT MISSISSIPPI
WANTS.
I DON'T THINK THAT WORKS IN
MISSISSIPPI.
DOES THAT WORK?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK SO.
YOUR VOTE IN THIS ELECTION WILL
DECIDE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE
UNITED STATES SENATE.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.
VERY IMPORTANT.
THAT'S A GREAT WOMAN.
THAT'S A GREAT WOMAN.
GOTTEN TO KNOW HER VERY WELL
OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS.
IF DEMOCRAS GET CONTROL, THEY
WILL RAISE YOUR TAXES, FLOOD
YOUR STREETS WITH CRIMINAL
ALIENS, WEAKEN OUR MILITARY,
OUTLAW PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE,
AND REPLACE FREEDOM WITH
SOCIALISM.
IN RA SHORT PERIOD OF TIME,
BECAUSE -- IN A SHORT PERIOD OF
TIME, BECAUSE I'LL BE DOING
LOTS, SO DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH,
THEY WILL TURN AMERICA INTO
VENEZUELA.
HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT?
AND OUR COUNTRY WILL NEVER BE
VENEZUELA.
WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
IF DEMOCRATS GET 51 SEATS, THE
KEY SENATE COMMITTEES WILL BE
RUN BY THE FAR LEFT.
BERNIE SANDERS.
CRAZY BERNIE.
IT'S AMAZING THAT HE WASN'T MORE
ANGRY THAT THE ELECTION GOT
STOLEN FROM HIM.
I DON'T GET IT.
HE'S ALWAYS LIKE COMPLAINING,
COMPLAINING, HE'S JUMPING
AROUND.
THE HAIR'S GOING CRAZY.
THE HAIR'S GOING CRAZY.
HE'S JUMPING LIKE A LUNATIC.
BUT HE NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT
THE FACT THAT CROOKED HILLARY
CHEATED HIM OUT OF THE ELECTION.
IT'S AMAZING.
IT'S AMAZING.
YOU KNOW, BERNIE WAS ON
TELEVISION RECENTLY.
AND HE WAS SCREAMING AND RANTING
AND RAVING.
AND I SAID TO MY WIFE, MELANIA,
WHO'S NOW IN AFRICA REPRESENTING
US, FIRST LADY.
I WATCHED HER GET OFF THAT PLANE
THIS MORNING IN AFRICA AND SO
BEAUTIFUL.
AND SHE WAS HUGGING AND KISSING
CHILDREN.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL TO SEE.
SHE'S DOING A GREAT JOB AS FIRST
LADY, I WILL TELL YOU.
REALLY IS.
AND YOU THINK THAT'S AN EASY
JOB.
THAT'S NOT AN EASY JOB.
THAT'S A TOUGH JOB.
SHE'S FANTASTIC.
BUT BERNIE SANDERS WAS RAPTING
AND RAVING AND WE'RE -- RANTING
AND RAVING AND WE'RE GONNA THIS,
AND TRUMP AND TRUMP AND WE GOT
TO STOP.
WHAT'S HE GOING TO STOP?
A STRONG MILITARY?
LOW TAXES?
STRONG BORDERS?
WHAT AM I DOING?
WHAT IS HE GOING TO STOP?
HAVING LESS REGULATION?
BUT HE'S GOING TO STOP TRUMP.
HE'S GOING TO STOP US LEFT AND
RIGHT.
HE'S RANTING AND RAVING.
AND THE COMMENTATOR LOOKS AT HIM
AND GOES, YOU KNOW HE'S WINNING
DON'T YOU?
AND BERNIE JUST LOOKED AT HIM
LIKE THIS.
IT WAS LIKE -- YOU GOT TO HAND
IT TO HIM.
HE'S OUT THERE DOING HIS THING
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.
YOU GOT TO HAND IT TO HIM.
A GUY LIKE BERNIE WOULD BE IN
CHARGE OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE.
PATRICK LEAHY.
HE'S NEVER HAD A DRINK IN HIS
LIFE.
CHECK IT OUT.
LOOK UNDER PATRICK LEAHY SLASH
DRINK.
HOW DARE YOU HAVE A BEER WHILE
YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL?
HOW DARE.
PATRICK LEAHY WILL BE IN CHARGE
OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.
BOB MENENDEZ, YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT HIM, WILL BE -- I'LL LEAVE
HIM ALONE.
BECAUSE WE CAN'T COVER TOO MANY
OF THESE CHARACTERS, RIGHT?
BUT I'M GOING TO LEAVE HIM
ALONE.
WILL BE IN CHARGE OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS.
AND THE GREAT DIANNE FEINSTEIN
WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?
NO.
WASN'T THAT GREAT?
WASN'T THAT GREAT?
WASN'T THAT SOMETHING THE OTHER
DAY?
SHE WAS ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION.
DID YOU LEAK THE DOCUMENT?
WASN'T THAT GREAT?
BY JOHN CORNEN.
HE GOES YOU LEAKED THE DOCUMENT.
NO, WHAT?
NO, WHAT?
UH, REMEMBER?
NO, NO I DIDN'T.
WELL, WAIT, DID WE LEAK THE
DOCUMENT?
NO.
HOW ABOUT THE AIDE?
NO, YOU IDIOT, NO.
NO WE DIDN'T LEAK THE DOCUMENT.
WE DIDN'T LEAK THE DOCUMENT.
NO WE DIDN'T.
THAT WAS THE WORST BODY LANGUAGE
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.
OH WHAT A GROUP.
WHAT A GROUP.
HOLIER THAN THOU, AREN'T THEY?
YOU KNOW THE EXPRESSION, RIGHT?
WHAT A GROUP.
ALSO AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION
IS MEDICARE.
DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON WANT TO
RAID MEDICARE TO PAY FOR THEIR
SOCIALIST AGENDA.
THEY'RE GOING TO DESTROY IT.
REPUBLICANS WANT TO PROTECT
MEDICARE FOR OUR GREAT SENIORS
WHO EARNED IT AND PAID FOR IT,
RIGHT?
RIGHT?
AND WE WILL ALWAYS PROTECT
AMERICANS WITH PREEXISTING
LOCATION.
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS BECAUSE
ITS JUST THE WAY LIFE IS,
FOLKS.
WE HAVE TO DO THAT.
AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING
ABOUT IT AND THEY CAN'T DO IT.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO PLAN.
SO JUST PUT IT DOWN AND SOME
REPUBLICANS SAY IS THAT A
REPUBLICAN THING?
WHETHER IT IS OR NOT, AND TO ME
IT IS, AND IT ALWAYS WILL BE.
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS WILL
ALWAYS BE TAKEN CARE OF BY US.
HAVE TO DO IT.
WE HAVE TO DO IT.
WE HAVE TO DO IT.
AND WE WANT TO DO ET.
I WANT TO -- DO IT.
I WANT TO DO IT.
WE'RE ALL GOING TO DO IT.
WE'RE DOING WELL.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM CHINA.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM THE EUROPEAN
UNION WHO HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF
US FOR YEARS.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM JAPAN.
WE'LL TAKE IT FROM OUR NEW
BEAUTIFUL TRANSACTION WHICH IS A
FAIR TRANSACTION.
AND GOOD FOR THEM TOO, MEXICO,
CANADA.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF
MONEY COMING IN FOLKS WHEN WE
FIX UP THESE HORRIBLE TRADE
DEALS.
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS.
PEOPLE THAT HAVE A PROBLEM ARE
GOING BE HELPED BY THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY FROM THE TIME I
GOT ELECTED REALLY.
YOU LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH
OBAMACARE, IT'S A DISASTER.
WE HAD IT BEATEN.
BUT I'LL SAY IT A DIFFERENT WAY
THAN I HAVE BEEN SAYING IT.
WE DIDN'T GET ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE.
WE HAD IT REPEALED AND REPLACED.
A LITTLE SHOCKER TOOK PLACE
EARLY IN THE MORNING.
BUT THE FACT IS WE DIDN'T GET
ONE DEMOCRAT VOTE.
WE WOULD HAVE SAVED A TRILLION
DOLLARS, THINK OF IT.
OUR COUNTRY WOULD HAVE SAVED $1
TRILLION HAD WE GOTTEN THAT
EXTRA VOTE.
WE DIDN'T GET ONE VOTE FROM ONE
DEMOCRAT.
BUT WE'VE PRETTY MUCH DISMANTLED
IT AND HERE'S THE NICE STORY.
WE'VE MANAGED IT WELL.
AND YOUR PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP
VERY LITTLE BY COMPARE.
156%, 187%, 116%, NOW WE GET IT
DOWN.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GREAT HEALTH
CARE.
>> THE NEW PLATFORM OF THE
DEMOCRAT PARTY IS TO ABOLISH
I.C.E., THE RITA BRAVER PEOPLE
OF I.C.E.
-- THE BRAVE
BRAVE PEOPLE OF I.C.E.
IN OTHER WORDS THEY WANT TO
ABOLISH IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT
ENTIRELY.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO.
DEMOCRATS ALSO SUPPORT STRONGLY
SANCTUARY CITIES OF DEATH.
SANCTUARY SANCTUARY CITIES.
EVERY DAY SANCTUARY CITIES ARE
UNLEASHING VICIOUS PREDATORS AND
BLOODTHIRSTY KILLERS LIKE MS-13
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.
THEY GO OUT AND THEY HIDE OUT IN
SANCTUARY CITIES.
THEN THEY COME INTO OUR CITIES
AND OUR TOWNS.
AND THEN WE SEND I.C.E.
IN AND
I.C.E.
HAS NO PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I.C.E.
IS MUCH TOUGHER
AND MUCH SMAFRTER THAN THEM --
SMARTER THAN THEM.
AND I.C.E.
HAS DONE AN
INCREDIBLE JOB.
AND THEY GRAB THEM BY THE NECK
AND THEY THROW THEM THE HECK OUT
OF OUR COUNTRY OR THEY THROW
THEM
>> THAT GOES FOR I.C.E.
WE'RE SETTING RECORDS ON THE
BORDER ON ARRESTS.
WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
WE'RE BUILDING THE WALL.
IT'S GOING UP.
BUT GETTING MONEY IS BRUTAL.
BRUTAL SO WE'VE STARTED THE WALL
AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN
CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE.
SAN DIEGO.
WE'RE MOVING EASTWARD AND WE'RE
COVERING A LOT OF TERRITORY.
THEY GAVE US $1.6 BILLION, $1.6
BILLION.
I WANT THE WHOLE THING SO WE CAN
BUILD THE WALL.
AND WE CAN DO A GREAT ONE IN ONE
YEAR.
BUT GETTING MONEY FROM THE
DEMOCRATS IS TOUGH BECAUSE THEY
KNOW THAT'S A BIG ISSUE FOR US.
AND THEY KNOW WE NEED IT.
MOST OF THEM VOTED FOR IT
IN 2006.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THAT.
OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A
WALL.
YOU HAVE PEOPLE POURING ACROSS.
THEY'RE TACKLING PEOPLE.
THEN OF COURSE THEY HAVE CATCH
AND RELEASE.
YOU CATCH SOMEBODY, WHO IS THIS
PERSON?
IT'S A CRIMINAL.
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
CATCH, TAKE HIS NAME, AND
RELEASE THE PERSON.
AND THE PERSON THEY THINK WILL
COME BACK TO COURT.
WE HAVE THE DUMBEST IMMIGRATION
LAWS MANY THE WHOLE WORLD.
WATCH WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT
COUPLE OF WEEKS FOLKS, WATCH.
WATCH.
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE
DEMOCRATS, EVERY REPUBLICAN
WANTS SOME CHANGE.
BUT THEY STOP YOU.
THE ONLY THING THEY'RE GOOD AT
-- THEY'RE LOUSY POLITICIANS,
HORRIBLE IN POLICY.
THEY'RE ONLY GOOD AT ONE THING,
RESISTING.
THEY'RE GOOD AT STICKING
TOGETHER.
YOU RARELY SEE THEM BREAK UP.
THEY STICK LIKE GLUE THEY STICK.
THAT'S THE ONLY THING THEY'RE
GOOD AT.
DELAY AND RESIST, REPUBLICANS
BELIEVE AMERICA SHOULD BE A
SANCTUARY FOR LAW-ABIDING
AMERICANS NOT FOR CRIMINAL
ALIENS.
IF YOU WANT SECURITY, IF YOU
WANT A STRONG BORDER, IF YOU
WANT TO HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS A
GREAT GREAT SAFE COUNTRY THEN
YOU NEED TO GO OUT AND YOU NEED
TO VOTE REPUBLICAN.
HAVE TO DO IT.
AND EVERYBODY THIS ELECTION IN
NOVEMBER IS ABOUT SAFETY AND
IT'S ALSO ABOUT PROSPERITY.
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR
WEALTH AWAY FROM YOU.
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR
WEALTH AWAY.
ALL OF THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE
JOBS AND THE SALARIES AND THE
WAGES THAT ARE RISING FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN 21 YEARS, THEY'RE
DOING TO TAKE IT AWAY FROM YOU
SO FAST.
SINCE THE ELECTION WE HAVE
CREATED OVER 4 MILLION NEW JOBS.
UNHEARD OF.
UNHEARD OF.
UNHEARD OF.
AND LIFTED ALMOST 4 MILLION
AMERICAS OFF OF FOOD STAMPS.
THAT'S A BIG THING.
WE'VE ADDED NEARLY 600,000 NEW
MANUFACTURING JOBS.
YOU REMEMBER WHEN THE PREVIOUS
ADMINISTRATION SAID, OH, YOU
CAN'T DO MANUFACTURING.
I SAID, REALLY?
WHO'S GOING TO BUILD THINGS?
THEY SAID YOU WON'T ADD ANY.
THEY SAID YOU NEEDED 5 MAGIC
WAND, REMEMBER -- A MAGIC WAND,
REMEMBER?
WE DON'T HAVE A MAGIC WAND.
WE HAVE GOOD POLICY.
WE HAVE GOOD LEADERSHIP.
AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS MANY TIMES
OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS.
AFRICAN-AMERICAN UNEMPLOYMENT
HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST RATE EVER
RECORDED.
EVER RECORDED.
EVER.
EVER.
REMEMBER, WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO
LOSE?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE, I
SAID.
AND PEOPLE SAID, OH, THAT'S NOT
NICE.
BUT I SAID, WAIT, THEY HAVE THE
WORST CRIME RATE.
THEY HAVE THE WORST SCHOOLS.
THEY HAVE THE WORST
HOMEOWNERSHIP PERCENTAGES.
THEY HAVE THE WORST -- I WENT
THROUGH A LIST OF TEN DIFFERENT
THINGS.
AND I LOOKED UP.
AND THEY'VE ALWAYS VOTED FOR
DEMOCRATS, THE
AFRICAN-AMERICANS.
95 MORE PERCENT.
I LOOKED UP AND SAID WHAT THE
DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?
REMEMBER?
AND NOW NOT ONLY DO THEY HAVE
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN
HISTORY BUT AFRICAN-AMERICAN
POVERTY HAS REACHED ITS LOWEST
RATE ALSO EVER RECORDED.
IT'S A GREAT THING, RIGHT?
SO -- AND WE'VE JUST STARTED.
WE'VE JUST STARTED.
REMEMBER, SAME TRUE FOR HISPANIC
AMERICANS.
THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
EVER RECORDED.
SAME FOR ASIAN AMERICANS.
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE EVER
RECORDED.
WOMEN LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
IN 65 YEARS.
AFTER YEARS AND YEARS OF WORKING
SO HARD WE FINALLY PUT OURSELVES
IN A POSITION WHERE WE CAN DO
THINGS AND WE CAN REALLY DO
THEM.
BUT WE CAN DO THEM AN AWFULLY
LOT BETTER IF WE HAD MORE -- A
REAL MAJORITY.
NOT A MAJORITY OF ONE.
NOT A MAJORITY OF LITERALLY LY
--
LITERALLY IF SOMEBODY IS SICK WE
HAVE TO POSTPONE VOTES.
WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE'VE DONE
SO MUCH.
WE'VE DONE SO MUCH.
WE'VE JUST FINALIZED THE
TREMENDOUS NEW TRADE AGREEMENT
WITH SOUTH KOREA WHERE IT WAS A
DISASTER.
THAT WAS A HILLARY CLINTON
CATASTROPHE.
REMEMBER SHE SAID WE ARE GOING
TO CREATE 250,000 NEW JOBS.
AND SHE WAS RIGHT FOR SOUTH
KOREA.
IT WAS GOOD.
AND WE'VE JUST TOTALLY
RENEGOTIATED IT.
WE'VE MADE IT GOOD.
AND WE'VE OPENED UP NEW
NEGOTIATIONS WITH JAPAN WHO
WOULD NOT NEGOTIATE WITH THE
PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION.
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THEY SAID WE'RE HAPPY,
WHY SHOULD WE NEGOTIATE?
WELL, WE SAID WE WANT TO
NEGOTIATE, AND WITH THE EUROPEAN
UNION WE WANT TO NEGOTIATE.
AND THEY SAID -- I LOVE YOU TOO,
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE BUT I LOVE
YOU.
THAT WAS A STRONG GUY, BY THE
WAY.
IN CASE.
BECAUSE IF THAT WAS A WOMAN I'M
IN BIG TROUBLE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HOPE YOU'RE A GUY, ARE YOU?
SO, SO THE EUROPEAN UNION AND
JAPAN I SAID, LISTEN, WE LOST
$151 BILLION, WITH A B, WITH
YOU.
WE LOST $151 BILLION.
JEAN CLAUDE, HE'S THE HEAD OF
THE EUROPEAN UNION.
I SAID JEAN CLAUDE, HE'S TOUGH
AND SMART.
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES OUR
COUNTRY MUCH, BUT I'VE TOLD HIM
THAT MANY TIMES.
WELL, THEY WERE FORMED IN ORDER
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US.
SO JEAN CLAUDE FOR YEARS THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WANTED TO
NEGOTIATE AND YOU SAID NO, WE'RE
NOT GOING TO NEGOTIATE.
I'M TELLING YOU I WANT TO
NEGOTIATE.
WE LOST $151 BILLION WITH THE
EUROPEAN UNION.
MANY OF US COME FROM THE
EUROPEAN UNION.
I DO.
MANY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.
SOUND SO NICE EUROPEAN UNION.
AND THEY'RE JUST KILLING US.
SO I SAID WE HAD TO NEGOTIATE.
OH, YES YES.
TWO WEEKS GO BY, WE DON'T GET A
CALL.
I CALL THEM UP AGAIN AND SAY
JEAN CLAUDE, WE GOT TO
NEGOTIATE.
OH YES YES YES, OH YES.
BEAUTIFUL ACCENT.
I WISH I HAD HIS ACCENT.
I WOULD HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT 15
YEARS AGO IF I HAD HIS ACCENT.
AND I SAID, JEAN CLAUDE, PLEASE,
WE GOT TO NEGOTIATE.
I CAN'T TAKE THIS.
$151 BLL WE LOSE.
-- BILLION WE LOSE.
YOU HAVE BARRIERS AGAINST OUR
FARMERS.
WE CAN'T SELL FARM PRODUCTS.
YOU HAVE BARRIERS AGAINST OUR
CARS, AND YET YOU GIVE US
MILLIONS OF MERCEDES AND BMW AND
ALL THESE CARS POUR INTO OUR
COUNTRY.
YOU HAVE BARRIERS AND YOU CHARGE
US BIG TARIFFS FOR PRODUCTS.
AND YOU MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR
US TO GIVE YOU BUT YOU SELL US
SO MUCH.
JEAN CLAUDE, WE HAVE TO
NEGOTIATE.
AND HE SAID OH YES, YES YES YES.
TWO WEEKS GO BY.
NO NEGOTIATION.
I SAY JEAN CLAUDE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO NEGOTIATE ANYMORE, JEAN
CLAUDE.
I AM GOING TO PUT A 25% TARIFF
ON MERCEDES-BENZ, BMW, AND EVERY
CAR YOU SEND IN TO THE UNITED
STATES.
WE'RE PUTTING A 25% TARIFF OR
TAX ON EVERY CAR.
úMILLIONS AND .
THAT YOU SEND INTO THE UNITED
STATES.
HE SAID NO NO, PLEASE, I WILL BE
THERE TOMORROW MORNING.
THIS WAS IN THE EVENING.
I GET TO MY OFFICE, HE'S THERE.
I SAID WHERE DID YOU COME FROM,
NEW YORK?
NO NO NO.
I CAME FROM EUROPE.
I SAID LET ME KNOW THE NAME OF
THAT PLANE.
THAT IS THE FASTEST PLANE.
AND NOW THEY'RE DYING TO MAKE A
DEAL.
YOU SAW WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON
WITH THESE DEALS.
CHINA.
THEY'RE DRAINING US.
THEY'RE TAKING OUR MONEY.
THEY'RE REBUILDING THEMSELVES.
THEY'RE BUILDING A JET A DAY.
THEY'RE PILDING A -- BUILDING
MANY MANY BRIDGES THE SIZE AND
BIGGER THAN THE GEORGE
WASHINGTON BRIDGE.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WE'RE HELPING THEM.
WE'VE REBUILT CHINA.
THEY'VE TAKEN SO MUCH MONEY.
I LIKE PRESIDENT XI, THE HEAD OF
CHINA, BUT I SAID WE CAN'T DO
THIS ANYMORE.
SO NOW WE PUT $50 BILLION
>> I SAID WAIT A MINUTE, WE ARE 
ALREADY 500 BILLION BEHIND. 
SO, IF I GO 50 AND YOU GO 50, 
WE ARE AT THE SAME PLACE WE 
STARTED FROM. 
THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL 
ABOUT. 
WE HAVE TO BRING SOME BALANCE. 
WE CANNOT DO THIS. 
SO, THEY SAID NO. 
SO, THERE IS 50 AT 10%. 
I -- ON TOP OF THE 50. 
 SO, NOW WE HAVE 
$250 BILLION AT 25%. 
BY THE WAY, BILLIONS AND 
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, AND THE 
FAKE NEWS PEOPLE BACK THERE, 
ALL THOSE NEWS PEOPLE WITH ALL 
THOSE RED LIGHTS -- THEY DON'T 
WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- BUT, ALL 
OF THAT MONEY, BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS WILL BE FLOWING INTO 
OUR TREASURY, MANY OF THE 
PRODUCTS THAT WE ARE BUYING 
OVER THERE WILL BE MADE IN THE 
OTHER STATES BECAUSE THEY DO 
NOT WANT TO PAY THE TAXES, 
THERE IS NO TAX. 
 
AND I SAID, IF YOU ATTACK OUR 
FARMERS, WHO I LOVE, THEY ARE 
SPECIAL. 
SEE HOW HE HAS THE GREEN HAT ON
? MAKE OUR FARMERS GREAT AGAIN. 
RIGHT? 
MAKE OUR FARMERS GREAT AGAIN. 
BUT, THEY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT, 
THE FARMERS LOVE TRUMP, WE WILL 
ATTACKED THE FARMERS BY NOT 
BUYING. 
THEY'RE STARTING TO BUY AGAIN, 
AREN'T THEY? 
IS IT IF YOU DO THAT WE WILL 
PUT AN ADDITIONAL $267 BILLION 
ON TO YOUR NUMBERS, SO WE WILL 
HAVE 500 AND PROBABLY -- IT 
WILL END UP -- $562 BILLION 
WHEN YOU ADD IT ALL UP 
INCLUDING THE LITTLE STARS ALL 
OVER THE PLACE, AND YOU KNOW 
WHAT? 
YOU WANT TO TALK, THEY WERE TO 
MAKE A DEAL. 
AND, CHINA HAS BEEN HURT VERY 
BADLY. 
THEIR MARKETS ARE DOWN 30%, AND 
OUR MARKETS ARE UP 55% SINCE I 
BECAME PRESIDENT. 
 
AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN MAKE A 
DEAL WITH CHINA, BUT HONESTLY 
-- AS SOON AS, BUT WE ARE VERY 
HAPPY WHERE WE ARE.  
VERY, VERY HAPPY. 
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
MISS BECAUSE YOU KNOW, I WATCH 
THE FARMERS, AND THEY SAY -- 
AND DON'T FORGET, THE FARMERS 
HAVE BEEN GOING DOWN LIKE THIS 
FOR 20 YEARS, LONG BEFORE I GOT 
HERE, WE ARE GOING TO BRING 
THOSE GREEN CAPS, YOU'RE GOING 
TO BE SO PROUD OF ME. 
OKAY? 
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO PROUD. 
THEY WANT TO TALK, AND AT SOME 
POINT THEY ARE TALKING. 
BUT, I TOLD THEM -- JUST 
RECENTLY, YOU ARE NOT READY TO 
TALK YET. 
YOU ARE NOT READY. 
IN ALL FAIRNESS, IT IS HARD FOR 
THEM TO SAY -- THEY ARE MAKING 
$500 BILLION A YEAR, BECAUSE WE 
HAD -- LET'S BE NICE, WE HAD 
PRESIDENTS THAT -- IT WAS NOT 
THEIR THING. 
BUT, IT IS MY THING. 
DO YOU KNOW HOW WEALTHY OUR 
COUNTRY WOULD BE IF THEY DID 
NOT HAVE THESE REALLY STUPID 
DEALS ALL OVER THE PLACE? 
SO MANY OF THEM. 
AND, HOW ABOUT OUR MILITARY 
DEALS? 
WHERE WE PROTECT ORIGINATIONS 
AND DO NOT GET REIMBURSED. 
THAT IS CHANGING ALSO, FOLKS. 
WE PROTECT SAUDI ARABIA, WOULD 
YOU SAY THEY ARE RICH? 
AND, I LOVE THE KING, BUT I 
SAID KING -- WE ARE PROTECTING 
YOU, YOU NOT -- YOU MIGHT NOT 
BE THERE TWO WEEKS WITHOUT US, 
YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR 
MILITARY. 
 
YOU HAVE TO PAY. 
AND, JAPAN IS GOING TO ALSO 
CONTRIBUTE. 
JAPAN, WE PROTECT JAPAN, THE 
PAST A SMALL PERCENTAGE. 
WE PROTECT SOUTH KOREA, THEY 
PAY US. 
AND, BY THE WAY, WE'RE DOING 
GREAT ON NORTH KOREA, BUT SOUTH 
KOREA, THEY HAVE TO REIMBURSE 
US. 
THE HAVE TO REIMBURSE US. 
 
REPUBLICANS PAST -- AND I 
SIGNED THE BIGGEST PACKAGE OF 
TAX CUTS AND REFORM IN THE 
HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. 
WE HAVE CUT A RECORD NUMBER OF 
REGULATIONS. 
WE HAVE NO DEMOCRAT SUPPORT FOR 
ANY OF THIS. 
THIS IS WHAT IS DRIVING OUR 
ECONOMY, THOSE TWO THINGS. 
WE HAVE APPROVED A RECORD 
NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE GENERIC 
DRUGS, WATCH WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN TO DRUG PRICES. 
 
>>> AND, TO HELP CRITICALLY ILL 
PATIENTS GET ACCESS TO LIFE-
SAVING TREATMENTS, WE PASSED 
WHAT IS CALLED RIGHT TO TRY, A 
PERSON'S TERMINALLY ILL, 
THEY'RE GOING TO DIE, AND BE 
FOR ME -- IF WE HAD A DRUG THAT 
IS REALLY LOOKING GOOD OR 
PROMISING, WE WOULD NOT GIVE 
THEM -- WE DID NOT WANT TO HURT 
THE PERSON. 
THEY'RE GOING TO DIE. 
AND, IT IS MUCH MORE 
COMPLICATED THAN THAT. 
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PASS 
THIS FOR 45 YEARS. 
WELL, TWO MONTHS AGO I SIGNED 
RIGHT TO TRY, WE HAVE THE 
GREATEST DRUGS IN THE WORLD, 
THE GREATEST DRUGMAKERS IN THE 
WORLD. 
 
>> I WOULD WATCH HEALTHY PEOPLE 
TRAVEL OVER THE WORLD TRYING TO 
FIND A CURE AND POOR PEOPLE 
JUST WANT HOME, THEY HAD NO 
HOPE. 
NOW, THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRY.
IF WE HAVE A DRUG THAT LOOKS 
GOOD, BUT IT IS TWO YEARS OR 
THREE YEARS OR FOUR YEARS OUT, 
AND BY THE WAY -- WE BROUGHT 
THAT NUMBER FROM 15 YEARS, WE 
THINK IT IS GOING TO BE DOWN TO 
4, AND IN SOME CASES 3, WAY 
DOWN. 
 
SCOTT IS DOING A GREAT JOB. 
SCOTT, GET THAT NUMBER DOWN, 
SCOTT. 
AND, NOW WE HAVE THAT -- OF A 
BUT, RIGHT TO TRY, SUCH A GREAT 
HIM -- RIGHT TO TRY, YOU HAVE 
HOPE. 
WE ALSO PASSED VETERANS CHOICE, 
44 YEARS THEY TRIED TO DO IT. 
GIVING VETERANS THE RIGHT TO 
SEE A PRIVATE DOCTOR IF THEY 
HAVE TO WAIT ONLINE FOR WEEKS 
AND WEEKS AND WEEKS.  
44 YEARS -- AND WE PASSED A 
LANDMARK VA ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 
THAT IS PEOPLE THAT WORK AT THE 
VA THAT TREAT OUR VETERANS 
BADLY AND WE CANNOT DO ANYTHING 
ABOUT IT, AND NOW WE CAN FIRE 
THEM SO FAST.  
 
I JUST SIGNED LEGISLATION, HE 
THINK THAT WAS EASY, GETTING 
THAT THROUGH THE UNIONS AND 
CIVIL SERVICE? 
THAT WAS A 42 YOUR JOB, AND 
YOUR TWO SENATORS HELPED ME A 
LOT. 
I WILL TELL YOU THEY HELPED ME 
A LOT. 
THANK YOU CINDY, THANK YOU 
ROGER. 
AND YOUR CONGRESSMAN BY THE WAY 
HELPED ME A LOT. 
PARTICULARLY YOUR CONGRESSMAN. 
I JUST SIGNED LEGISLATION TO 
COMPLETELY REBUILD OUR MILITARY 
SECURING $700 BILLION AND THEN 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR 716 BILLION 
TO PURCHASE THE FINEST -- FINEST
PLANES AND SHIPS AND MISSILES 
AND SUBMARINES ON THE FACE OF 
THE EARTH. 
ALL MADE IN AMERICA, MADE IN 
THE USA.  AND WE HAVE GIVEN OUR 
TROOPS THEIR LARGEST PAYRAISE 
IN MORE THAN A DECADE, ISN'T 
THAT NICE? 
ABOUT TIME. 
AT MY DIRECTION THE PENTAGON IS 
NOW WORKING VERY HARD TO CREATE 
THE SIXTH BRANCH OF THE 
AMERICAN ARMED FORCES, IT IS 
CALLED -- THE SPACE FORCE. 
YOU HAVE THE AIR FORCE, THE 
SPACE FORCE. 
THE SPACE FORCE. 
AND THAT IS WHAT IT IS ALL 
ABOUT FOLKS PRETTY LOOK AT WHAT 
IS HAPPENING, NOT JUST ROCKETS 
TO THE MOON AND TO MARS, AND 
TALKING ABOUT DEFENSE, AND 
TALKING ABOUT -- THAT IS WHERE 
IT IS, IT IS IN SPACE. 
ARMY, NAVY, AIR FORCE, MARINES, 
COAST GUARD, RIGHT? 
SPACE FORCE. 
 
I WOULD MOVE THE UNITED STATES 
FROM THE HORRIBLE, ONE-SIDED 
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL AND IRAN IS A 
MUCH DIFFERENT COUNTRY. THEY'RE 
TRYING TO PUT OUT ALL THE 
RIGHTS THEY HAVE ALL OVER THE 
COUNTRY. 
YOU KNOW, WHEN I BECAME 
PRESIDENT -- BEFORE I BECAME -- 
I SAID HOW DO YOU STOP AND 
IRAN? 
NOBODY WAS ABLE TO TELL ME. 
AND, I DID THIS, AND THEY HAVE 
SHATTERED, MAN. 
THEY HAVE SHATTERED. 
I GOT RID OF THAT DEAL. 
HOW ABOUT -- WE GIVE THEM 150 
BILLION FOR NOTHING? 
WE GIVE THEM 1.8 BILLION IN 
CASH FOR NOTHING. 
AND, WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE 
CAPITAL OF ISRAEL AND OPEN THE 
AMERICAN EMBASSY IN JERUSALEM. 
 
AND WE WON'T EVEN MENTION HOW 
WELL WE ARE DOING WITH NORTH 
KOREA. 
BUT, WHEN I CAME IN THERE TO -- 
THERE ARE GOING TO GO TO WAR 
WITH NORTH KOREA, PRESIDENT 
OBAMA SAID IT WAS HIS BIGGEST 
PROBLEM. 
WE SET BEFORE I TOOK OFFICE. WE 
ARE GOING TO GO TO WAR WITH 
NORTH KOREA. 
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL NOW WITH 
NORTH KOREA, YOU DO NOT FEEL 
THAT ANYWAY RIGHT? 
>> YOU DO NOT FEEL THAT WAY 
ANYMORE. 
AND, THE FAKE NEWS COMES OUT 
AND SAYS HE IS GIVING SO MUCH. 
I HAVE NOT GIVEN ANYTHING. 
WE GOT OUR HOSTAGES BACK. 
RIGHT? 
 
WE HAVE GOT A LOT AND WE ARE 
GETTING THE REMAINS OF OUR 
GREAT FALLEN HEROES BACK. 
 
THERE HAS BEEN NO ROCKETS 
LAUNCHED, THERE HAVE BEEN NO 
MISSILES LAUNCHED, THERE HAS 
BEEN NO NUCLEAR TEST, AND WE 
HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.  
AND SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE 
POMPEO IS GOING OVER TO NORTH 
KOREA NEXT WEEK. WE ARE WORKING 
ON A SECOND SUMMIT. 
AND, IT JUST FEELS GOOD. 
NOW, WHO KNOWS FOLKS? 
WHO KNOWS. 
I JUST CAN TELL YOU -- WHEN WE 
CAME IN, BEFORE I CAME IN, AND 
AT THE BEGINNING WHEN THE 
RHETORIC WAS TOUGH, RIGHT? 
THAT RHETORIC WAS TOUGH. 
THESE PEOPLE WERE SAYING OH, HE 
IS GOING TO GET US INTO A WAR. 
WELL, GUESS WHAT? 
THAT WORKED OUT. 
THAT RHETORIC WAS TOUGH, AND 
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
BUT, WE'RE DOING VERY WELL. 
WE ARE DOING VERY WELL .4 
YEARS, YOU WATCHED -- AS YOUR 
LEADERS APOLOGIZED FOR AMERICA. 
NOW YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS 
STANDING UP FOR AMERICA. 
  
WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR 
VALUES, WE ARE STANDING UP FOR 
MISSISSIPPI, WE ARE STANDING 
PROUDLY -- WE ARE STANDING UP 
FOR YOUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.  
 
A LOT OF SPIRIT, A LOT OF 
SPIRIT. 
ONE OF THEM SAID THE OTHER DAY, 
YOU KNOW -- PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CANNOT BE BEATEN IN 2020, THAT 
IS DRIVING THEM CRAZY, --  WHO 
THE HILL IS GOING TO BE TEST?  
LOOK -- WHO IS GOING TO BEAT 
US? 
IF ANOTHER PRESIDENT CAME IN 
AND THEY SAID WE ARE COMING TO 
MISSISSIPPI, AND WE ARE GOING 
TO MAKE A SPEECH, YOU KNOW HOW 
MANY PEOPLE WOULD SHOW UP? 
YOU KNOW, 300, 400, HE WOULD 
HAVE A MEDIUM-SIZED MEETING 
ROOM AT A HOTEL. 
LOOK AT THIS PLACE. 
LOOK AT THIS PLACE LOOK AT THIS 
PLACE. 
 
WE ARE LIFTING MILLIONS OF OUR 
CITIZENS FROM WELFARE TO WORK, 
FROM DEPENDENCE TO 
INDEPENDENCE, AND FROM POVERTY 
TO PROSPERITY, THAT IS WHAT IS 
HAPPENING. 
BUT, TO CONTINUE OUR INCREDIBLE 
MOMENTUM, YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR 
FRIENDS, GET YOUR FAMILY, GET 
YOUR NEIGHBORS, GET YOUR 
COWORKERS, GET OUT AND VOTE 
REPUBLICAN.  
BUT FOR CINDY SMITH, AND VOTE 
FOR ROGER RICKER. YOU HAVE GOT 
TO DO IT. 
A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS A 
VOTE FOR TO -- LOWER TAXES, 
LESS REGULATION, AND MORE 
PRODUCTS MADE RIGHT HERE IN THE 
USA. 
 
IT IS A VOTE TO REDUCE CRIME, 
RESPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND 
RESTORE THE RULE OF LAW. 
IT IS A BOOK FOR STRONG ORDERS, 
SAFE COMMUNITIES, AND THRIVING 
FAMILIES, WHICH YOU ARE. 
AND, A VOTE FOR REPUBLICANS IS 
A VOTE TO REJECT THE DEMOCRAT 
POLITICS OF ANGER, DESTRUCTION, 
CHAOS, AND TO COME TOGETHER AS 
NEIGHBORS, AS CITIZENS, AND AS 
AMERICANS .2 EVERYONE IN THIS 
ROOM TONIGHT, TO EVERY CITIZEN 
WATCHING ALL ACROSS OUR LAND, 
THIS IS YOUR TIME TO CHOOSE.
A VERY IMPORTANT TIME, WHEN YOU 
LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING TO 
JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, THIS IS 
AN IMPORTANT TIME.  
IT IS TIME TO CHOOSE IF WE TURN 
BACKWARD TO THE FAILURE AND 
FRUSTRATIONS OF THE PAST, OR 
WHETHER WE CONTINUE FORWARD 
INTO THE UNLIMITED PROMISE OF 
OUR FUTURE. 
IT IS NOT UP TO THE MEDIA OR 
THE PUNDITS TO DECIDE YOUR FATE
, IT IS UP TO YOU. THE FUTURE 
IS IN YOUR HANDS, AS IT WAS IN 
2016. 
THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL TIME. 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AN 
ELECTION LIKE THIS. 
NOT IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY. 
YOU HAVE THE POWER, JUST AS YOU 
DID IN 2016, WITH YOUR VOTE TO 
SAVE AMERICA FROM SOCIALISM, 
AND TO SAVE AMERICA FROM DK. IT 
IS UP TO YOU ON NOVEMBER 6 TO

PATRIOTISM, PROSPERITY, AND 
PRIDE. 
LOYAL CITIZENS LIKE YOU HELP 
BUILD THIS COUNTRY, AND 
TOGETHER, WE ARE TAKING BACK 
OUR COUNTRY, RETURNING POWER TO 
EVERY DAY AMERICANS. 
 
WE STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF 
THE GIANTS OF AMERICAN HISTORY, 
THE GREATEST, THE TOUGHEST, THE 
MOST COURAGEOUS MEN AND WOMEN 
EVER TO WALK THE FACE OF THE 
EARTH. 
OUR ANCESTORS CROSSED THE OCEANS
, SETTLED OF THE CONTINENT, ONE 
A REVOLUTION, AND FOUGHT TO 
VICTORY IN TWO WORLD WARS, 
THINK OF IT. 
 
TO THINK OF IT. 
THINK OF IT. 
AMERICAN PATRIOTS DEFEATED 
FASCISM, TRIUMPHED OVER 
COMMUNISM, AND DELIVERED 
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE 
INTO FREEDOM.  THESE CAN -- 
COURAGEOUS PATRIOTS DID NOT 
SHED THEIR BLOOD, SWEAT AND 
TEARS SO THAT WE COULD SIT AT 
HOME WHILE OTHERS TRY TO TEAR 
DOWN THEIR LEGACY AND DESTROY 
OUR PROUD AMERICAN HERITAGE. 
RIGHT? 
 
JUST LIKE THE PIONEERS AND 
PATRIOTS WHO CAME BEFORE US, WE 
ARE GOING TO WORK AND FIGHT AND 
WE ARE GOING TO WIN, WIN, WIN. 
 
WE WILL NOT BEND, WE WILL NOT 
BREAK, WE WILL NEVER GIVEN, WE 
WILL NEVER GIVE UP.  WE WILL 
NEVER BACK DOWN, WE WILL NEVER 
SURRENDER, AND WE WILL ALWAYS 
FIGHT ON TO VICTORY. 
 
BECAUSE, WE ARE AMERICA. 
AND OUR HEARTS BLEED RED WHITE 
AND BLUE. 
 
WE ARE ONE PEOPLE, ONE FAMILY, 
AND ONE GLORIOUS NATION UNDER 
GOD.  
 
AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE 
AMERICA WEALTHY AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONG 
AGAIN. 
WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT 
AGAIN. 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
MISSISSIPPI. 
GET OUT AND VOTE, THANK YOU. 
 
>>> WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO 
PRESIDENT TRUMP THERE 
CAMPAIGNING  EXTENSIVELY FOR 
CINDY HYDE SMITH. SHE HAS A 
LOVESEAT FOR LESS THAN SIX 
MONTHS THERE. 
BUT, REALLY THE NEWS OUT OF 
THIS RALLY -- WE HEARD EARLY ON 
IS THE PRESIDENT SPOKE WITH HIS 
SUPPORTERS ABOUT THE NOMINATION 
OF JUDGE BRETT KAVANAUGH, HIS 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE. 
AT ONE POINT  THE CROWD BROKE 
OUT INTO A CHANT OF WE WANT 
BRETT KAVANAUGH, WE WANT BRETT 
KAVANAUGH. 
THEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP  WENT ON 
TO MOCK THE TESTIMONY OF THE 
WOMAN WHO TESTIFIED JUST LAST 
WEEK BEFORE THE SENATE 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, DR. 
CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD. 
AND, ALLEGED THAT IT WAS  AN 
ATTEMPTED SEXUAL ASSAULT OR A 
SEXUAL ASSAULT RATHER BY BRETT 
KAVANAUGH THAT CAUSED HER TO 
COME FORWARD AND SHARE THIS 
STORY. 
BUT, THE PRESIDENT, WHO JUST 
DAYS AGO CALLED DR. CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD IS  CREDIBLE AND 
COMPELLING TONIGHT APPEARED TO 
MOCK THAT SAME TESTIMONY. 
LET'S TURN TO WHITE HOUSE 
CORRESPONDENT WE SHOW SHANK WHO 
IS THERE AND MISSISSIPPI 
ENTRANCES FROM THE RALLY. 
LET'S START WITH THAT 
NOMINATION. 
LET'S PLAY THAT PORTION OF THE 
RALLY WHERE THE PRESIDENT 
APPEARED TO MOCK THAT TESTIMONY 
OF DR. CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD.  
>> WHAT HE IS GOING THROUGH, 36 
YEARS AGO THIS HAPPENED. 
I HAD ONE BEER, RIGHT? 
I HAD ONE BEER. 
WELL, -- KNOW, IT WAS ONE BEER 
.0, GOOD. 
HOW DID YOU GET HOME? 
I DON'T REMEMBER COMMODITY GET 
THERE? 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
WHERE WAS THE PLACE? 
I DON'T REMEMBER. 
HOW MANY YEARS AGO WAS THAT? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
 
I DON'T KNOW. 
I DON'T KNOW. 
WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD WAS IT IN? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
WHERE IS THE HOUSE? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
UPSTAIRS, DOWNSTAIRS, WHERE WAS 
IT? 
I DON'T KNOW. 
BUT, I HAD ONE BEER, THAT IS 
THE ONLY THING THAT I REMEMBER. 
AND, A MAN'S LIFE IS IN TATTERS,
A MAN'S LIFE IS SHATTERED, HIS 
WIFE IS SHATTERED, HIS 
DAUGHTERS, WHO ARE BEAUTIFUL 
INCREDIBLE, YOUNG KIDS -- THEY 
DESTROY PEOPLE. 
THEY WANT TO DESTROY PEOPLE. 
THESE ARE REALLY EVIL PEOPLE. 
>> GIVE US SOME CONTEXT HERE. 
WE HAD NOT HEARD THOSE KIND OF 
COMMENTS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP 
IN FACT, SERVICING JUST BEFORE 
WE CAME TO YOU,  IT WAS JUST A 
FEW DAYS AGO THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP SAID THIS OF HER 
TESTIMONY --  QUOTE, I THOUGHT 
HER TESTIMONY WAS COMPELLING 
AND SHE LOOKS LIKE A VERY FINE 
WOMAN TO ME. 
A VERY DIFFERENT TONE TONIGHT. 
NOT YEAH, HE WENT THERE. 
HE WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE 
THINK A LOT OF WHITE HOUSE 
AIDES AND REPUBLICANS WERE 
HOLDING THEIR BREATH, HOPING 
THAT HE WOULD NOT DO THAT 
BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH A 
VULNERABLE POSITION RIGHT NOW, 
WAITING FOR THE FINDINGS OF THE 
OFFICIAL FBI INVESTIGATION THAT 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED. 
BUT, TONIGHT  IT WAS A TOTALLY 
DIFFERENT CHANGE IN HIS TONE 
AND HIS DEFIANCE. 
HE MADE IT PRETTY CLEAR WHAT HE 
BELIEVES, AND YET, THIS CROWD 
WAS ELECTRIC TONIGHT. 
IT WAS SUCH A MASSIVE RALLY, 
ESPECIALLY COMING OFF OF THE 
ONE LAST NIGHT IN JOHNSON CITY, 
TENNESSEE. 
I THINK THAT ENERGY REALLY 
PROPELLED HIM TO MAKE THESE 
STATEMENTS, BECAUSE AS WE HAVE 
SEEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP FEEDS OFF  
WHATEVER MOOD THE CROWD IS IN. 
AND, THIS WAS A VERY RAUCOUS 
CROWD. 
OBVIOUSLY, MORE THAN OTHERS 
HERE TO CHAT WITH THE PRESIDENT.
TWO HANG ON TO HIS EVERY WORD, 
AND I THINK BECAUSE HE REALLY 
THOUGHT THAT ENERGY, HE WENT 
WITH IT. 
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS A LONG RALLY 
AND YOU COULD TELL AND THE WITH 
HE WAS SPEAKING, AND THE WAY 
THAT HE WAS ENERGIZING THE 
PEOPLE HERE, THAT HE REALLY 
TOOK ON A DIFFERENT PERSONA IN 
DEALING WITH THE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH  CONTROVERSY. 
EVEN YESTERDAY, EVEN THOUGH HE 
MENTIONED BRETT KAVANAUGH,  
TONIGHT FELT DIFFERENT, BECAUSE 
AGAIN IT SEEMED TO BE THAT HE 
WAS ATTACKING DR. CHRISTINE 
BLASEY FORD, AND SO  AS YOU 
MENTIONED, ELAINE, IT SEEMS 
LIKE THE FURTHER AWAY WE GET 
FROM THAT TESTIMONY DAY, THE 
MORE THE -- MORE TIME PASSES, 
IT BEGINS TO QUESTION HER MORE 
AND MORE, BECAUSE INITIALLY, 
WHEN HE FIRST MADE PUBLIC 
REMARKS ABOUT IT, HE TALKED 
ABOUT HOW CREDIBLE AND MOVING 
HER STORY WAS, AND THEN HE 
CALLED FOR THE INVESTIGATION 
AND HE TALKED ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF GETTING ANSWERS. 
BUT, HERE WE ARE TONIGHT, WITH 
A VERY DIFFERENT PRESIDENT 
TRUMP, WHO OPENLY, PUBLICLY,  
MOCKED HER. EVEN AS HIS FBI 
CONTINUES TO INVESTIGATE. 
>> THAT IS RIGHT. 
AND, I WONDER -- I KNOW IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO HEAR, BUT YOU 
KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER 
ON TUESDAY SAID THIS --  IT IS 
A VERY SCARY TIME FOR MEN IN 
AMERICA, REGARDING BEING 
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. 
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE 
POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS OR 
CALCULATIONS THAT THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND HIS AIDES ARE MAKING 
REGARDING THIS ISSUE? 
BECAUSE, AS WE SAW THERE, 
PRESIDENT TRUMP  CLEARLY ENJOYS 
THE SUPPORT FROM HIS DAYS. 
IT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF 
DIMINISHING. 
>> THAT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT 
PART, BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT 
HIS AIDES, AND THOSE VERY CLOSE 
TO HIM PERHAPS WARNED HIM TO BE 
VERY CAUTIOUS OF TREADING INTO 
THIS TERRITORY WHEN HE IS 
TALKING ABOUT THE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH  NOMINATION AND IN 
FACT, I HAVE TALKED TO SOURCES 
THAT SAY THAT THE PROBLEM IS 
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS TRUMP  AND 
HE IS GOING TO BE HIMSELF 
REGARDLESS OF WHAT ADVICE HE 
GETS, THE TONE HE TAKES THEM IN 
TERMS OF THE LANGUAGE HE USES, 
IS GOING TO SAY WHAT HE WANTS 
TO, AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY THE 
THIRD TIME OR PERHAPS THE 
FOURTH TIME I HAVE HEARD IN 
PUBLIC THAT HE IS VERY STRONG 
ABOUT WHAT YOU JUST SAID, THAT 
HE HAS A WARNING FOR YOUNG MEN 
IN THIS COUNTRY. 
YOU KNOW, THAT THE COUNTRY IS 
SOMEHOW OUT TO GET THEM, WARNING
THAT THEIR JOBS COULD BE AT 
STAKE. 
WARNING MOTHERS AND WIVES AND 
SISTERS THAT THEIR LOVED ONES 
COULD FIND THEMSELVES IN A 
PLACE, AND BE FALSELY ACCUSED. 
WHAT HE DOES NOT ADDRESS IS 
VALID ALLEGATIONS. 
HE DOES NOT TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW,
ALL THOSE CREDIBLE ACCUSATIONS 
THAT LEAD TO CRIMINAL CHARGES. 
AND HE DID NOT TALK ABOUT THE 
WOMAN WHO COME FORWARD, WHO 
MAKE THOSE ALLEGATIONS, AND 
WHAT THEY MIGHT BE GOING 
THROUGH. 
INSTEAD, HE FOCUSES, AS HE DID 
TODAY, HEADING DOWN HERE TO 
MISSISSIPPI, I'M SORRY -- I 
THINK IT WAS IN PHILADELPHIA, 
BUT THE POINT IS HE DOUBLES 
DOWN ON HIS WARNING TO MEN THAT 
IT IS REALLY THEIR BURDEN TO 
CARRY, BECAUSE THEY COULD 
FACE'S FALSE ACCUSATIONS AND IT 
COULD PUT THE MONEY TO AFFECT 
USE -- SITUATION. 
THAT IS WHAT WE HEARD AGAIN. 
AS YOU POINTED OUT HERE, HE HAS 
MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES THAT 
THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE 
VICTIMS HERE. 
>> IT HAS BEEN A BUSY NEWSDAY 
AND HAS -- CONTINUES TO BE. 
LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE 
INVESTIGATIVE PIECE THAT WAS 
RELEASED TUESDAY THAT ALLEGES 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ENGAGED  IN TAX 
FRAUD, CAN YOU REMIND US ABOUT 
THE BASIC OUTLINES OF WHAT WAS 
IN THAT REPORT, AND HOW IS IT 
THAT THE WHITE HOUSE HAS 
RESPONDED? 
>> JUST MINUTES BEFORE THIS 
RALLY STARTED, WHITE HOUSE 
PRESS SECRETARY SARAH SANDERS 
SENT A VERY DEFIANT STATEMENT 
SAYING THAT THE STORY WAS 
COMPLETELY FALSE, AND THAT 
THESE WERE NOT NEW PIECES OF 
INFORMATION THAT IN FACT, THE 
IRIS HAD THIS INFORMATION IN 
THE PAST, AND THEY SIGNED OFF 
ON IT, AND THERE WAS NO 
CRIMINAL FINDING HERE. 
SO, BASICALLY HERE IS WHAT WE 
HAVE -- A PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT 
EVEN BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE,  HE 
REALLY SOLD HIMSELF AND 
CONTINUES TO SELL HIMSELF AS A 
SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE, SOMEONE 
WHO ONLY TO $1 MILLION FROM HIS 
FATHER, AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO 
GROW THAT BY SO MUCH. 
SO, THE ARTICLE -- AND, THIS IS 
BASED ON -- ACCORDING TO THE 
NEW YORK TIMES, EXTENSIVE 
INTERVIEWS AND OVER 100,000 
PAGES OF OTHER FINANCIAL 
DOCUMENTS, THE ARTICLE CLAIMS 
THAT IN FACT IT WAS A LOAN OF 
ABOUT $61 MILLION THAT HE HAS 
YET TO PAY BACK IN FULL, AND 
THAT OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL 
YEARS PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS 
SIBLINGS WORKED OUT SEVERAL 
SCHEMES  TO RAKE IN MONEY FROM 
THEIR PARENTS.  
TO HIDE DIFFERENT POCKETS OF 
MONEY AS GIFTS, AND TO WORK OUT 
A STRATEGY TO UNDERVALUE THEIR 
REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS ON TAX 
RETURNS, SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO 
PAY LESS IN TAXES. 
AND, SPINNER TIMES REALLY 
SPELLS OUT HOW THIS:FOR THE 
KNOW, I SHOULD SAY THAT AN 
ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP 
RELEASED A STATEMENT SAYING 
THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE 100%  ALSO
THE INTERESTING PART OF THAT 
STATEMENT WAS THAT HE ACTUALLY 
CALLED OUT THE PRESIDENTS OTHER 
FAMILY MEMBERS AND SAID THEY 
MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED, BUT THE 
PRESIDENT HIMSELF WAS NOT. 
BUT, WE SHOULD ALSO MENTION 
THAT THE NEW YORK STATE 
DEPARTMENT OF TAXATION 
RESPONDED TODAY SAYING THAT 
THEY ARE INVESTIGATING THESE NEW
ALLEGATIONS THAT HAVE JUST COME 
TO LIGHT AS A RESULT OF THIS 
INVESTIGATION BY THE NEW YORK 
TIMES SO THE PRESIDENT DID NOT 
DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS, BUT HE 
CONTINUED TO SLAM THE MEDIAS 
FAKE NEWS PUTTING OUT FAKE 
INFORMATION ABOUT HIM. 
BY THE WAY, IT CALLS INTO 
QUESTION THIS ONGOING REFUSAL 
FOR THE PRESIDENT TO RELEASE 
HIS TAX RETURNS. 
HE COULD PUT ALL THIS TO BED 
EARLY SEEN HIS TAX RETURNS BUT 
HE CITES AN ONGOING AUDIT IS 
THE REASON WHY HE REFUSES TO DO 
THAT, WHICH BREAKS FROM DECADES 
OF PRECEDENT SET BY HIS 
PREDECESSORS AS WE HAVE SEEN 
FORMER PRESIDENTS PUT IT OUT 
THERE SO IT IS NOT A BIG 
QUESTION LOOMING. 
WHICH IT CONTINUES TO BE OVER 
PRESIDENT TRUMP.  
>> WE WILL SEE IF HE RESPONDS 
FURTHER IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE 
SAW FROM SARAH SANDERS. 
ALL RIGHT, THANKS SO MUCH. 
>>> COMING UP, DEMOCRATS SEE 
THE DELAY IN THE BRETT 
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION AS A 
WINNING ISSUE IN NOVEMBER.  
SO TO REPUBLICANS. 
YOU ARE STREAMING RED AND BLUE 
ON CBSN.
