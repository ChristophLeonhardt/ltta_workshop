as Congress tries to grapple with the their intentions of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act Donald Trump has decided that you know he hasn't really figured out what he wants more and any option that goes against the Affordable Care Act is a good option for him so during Trump's interview with the New York Times he explained some of the difficulties involving the repeal and replace plan for the Affordable Care Act and in doing so he attempted to detail what he thinks healthcare is but he kind of showed these little ignorant on health care policy so if you don't believe me I'm gonna read you his response to the New York Times verbatim he said as they get something it gets tougher because politically you can't give it away so pre-existing conditions are a tough deal because you are basically saying from the moment the insurance you're 21 years old you start working and you're paying 12 dollars a year for insurance and by the time you're 70 you get a nice plan here's something where you walk up and say I want my insurance it's a very tough deal but it is something that we're doing a good job of what I don't I don't know there are parts of that answer where I don't even know what he's talking about the notion that when you're young and healthy you only spend 12 dollars a year not even 12 dollars a month he said 12 dollars a year on insurance is absurd and then he thinks of insurance the way that he spoke about health insurance sounded like he was confusing it for life insurance right you know and you hear those life insurance commercials on CNN along with super Beta Prostate commercials where they're lying yeah $12 a month and then by the time you're like ready to die we're gonna give you half a million dollars so he thinks that's the way it works yeah because that's where he gets his information from cable news oh that's terrible no it's a he was completely at sea as to what he was talking about and then as Anna says he was obviously confusing health insurance and life insurance he certainly doesn't know any specifics and we'll get to that in a second about the health care bill he doesn't know many specifics about many things remember this is a president who is briefed in one-page briefings preferably those that include his name repeatedly this is not me just being cute this is literally what they do at the White House so it doesn't surprise me that he's he's adrift on this right he's not he's not a fan of briefings he's been pretty clear about that and it's it's obvious and his answers to some of these questions but what's interesting is you know when someone gets to a point where they feel confident enough to run as the leader of this country and one of the most powerful people in the world you would think that they would just know how the world works at least a little bit and it seems like he's completely oblivious to some of the most important components of our lives but he is also oblivious in regard to his own ignorance in fact he thinks he's super intelligent on this topic he says so himself he says these guys couldn't believe it talking about members of Congress and people around him how much I know about it I know a lot about health care no you don't know you don't you never talk about details or specifics and then when you make the mistake of doing so you sound like you don't know anything at all yeah look he is not short on confidence he's he's an egomaniacal megalomaniac right and he just can't wait to tell you how great he is in fact it's probably the only thing he can speak with some authority on everything else is being brought to him he is simply he's simply the pretty face of this presidency and and you know that's the key thing to remember here this is a popularity contest and I mentioned a moment ago and I thought it's a good point you know how can anyone ascend to this level and not have some working understanding of government or policies or how things work well because of the way we elect presidents this way this in this time in this culture in this moment because it's a popularity contest and one thing he does well and I said it before here he messages so effectively and there are people who drink in that message and it's a cult of personality so from his standpoint all he has to do is deliver that cult of personality and that's what he does that is what he does also he doesn't really know when Congress votes on it thing so I want to give you this exchange with the reporter Maggie Haberman he says well I say let's not vote on repeal let's just vote on this so first they vote on the vote and that happens sometime Friday Maggie Haberman responds next week or Monday Monday and then they'll vote on this and we'll see we have some meeting scheduled today I think we have six people who are really sort of ok they are all good people we don't have bad people I know the bad people believe me do I know bad people oh my god ok well if if you're not alarmed by his lack of knowledge or his ignorance on this incredibly important issue you're not alone because Senator Bill Cassidy feels the same way take a look so there are new conversations with him do you think the president understands the political the policy intricacies of this bill I don't think it's important for him to understand the policy and the entities of this bill it's important for him is to understand the principle his principle is that there should be a replace associated with repeal ok that's exactly we're just talking about right it's not important that you understand it it's just important that he'd be Trump but he'd lean into these people and say hey look we've got a price to pay if you don't you know if you don't follow along with the White House scripts yeah it's it's completely disheartening to see the GOP fall in line behind this guy yeah fall in line especially when it comes to something that has to do with life and death situations something that so many Americans rely on depend on and need real leadership on and for them it's just a game of patty-cakes for them this is all fun and games and it's pathetic to play party politics with these things that affects so many lives and he's such a populist president in that weird way in other words he was he rode to power on the backs of so many people who need health care and really need government help it's the true irony it's been made at that point time and time again but as Anna says this is a community of Americans that is going to be dropping to the floor if if they roll back what's on the books if you like this video you probably like independent media the best way to support independent media become a member of the Young Turks TYT Network calm /join
