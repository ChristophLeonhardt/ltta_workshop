joining us now ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Democratic congressman Jerry Nadler of New York also with us White House correspondent for Bloomberg News Shannon petty piece good to have you on board as well congressman we will start with you we want to first talk about the issue of the day which is gun legislation did anything move you yesterday on these issues and do you think Republicans will be moved well watching these young people talk and watching that young fellow the meeting with the president talked about his anguish and and seeing the evident anguish of course that's moving you'd have to be a stone that not to be moved by that do I think the president or the Republicans were moved I don't know we'll find out actions speak louder than words and the fact that matter is we know what to do to decrease the gun violence I mean you look at the statistics every other country number of people who killed by guns 45 70 to 130 the United States 33,000 a year and the only real variable is the easy availability of guns in this country Australia had a school shooting a number of years ago they they they banned assault weapons they did a number of other things and they haven't had it since we know what to do the only question is will we do it and I haven't seen the President or any of the Republicans really step up to the plate and and and the Vincente are willing to do anything meaningful and we know what we ought to do we have to eliminate the loopholes in the background check so that you have to pass it background check wherever you buy a gun not just from a licensed gun dealer we have to ban assault weapons ban large capacity magazines and then their number those are the important ones and a number of subsidiary ones better mental health the ban sales - to people who can't can't fly been sales the people who commit domestic violence even if they're not married and so forth so I don't disagree with any of that the President did step up in the sense study he he opened the microphone to the people affected but then Joe he tweeted about Jeff Sessions well yeah I we will not Jerry I won't talk to you about the president asking people to call his attorney general that's unusual but what about his point that is a fair point I believe it's a fair point that not that Barack Obama should be investigated but that it was the Obama it was the Obama administration that sat back while evidence mounted of Russian interference in the 2016 election right what what should the president have done where did the President President Obama come up short well I'm not sure what the president should have done you could argue that he should have spoken out more sooner and so forth but he he he wanted to do that but he was warned by Senator McConnell the majority leader that if he tried to issue a call against the Russian interference in the elections that he would label that as partisan and the president that didn't want to be seen as partisan one could argue with that judgment but the real question is not that I mean we know what happened the real question is that the President of the United States now refuses to admit that we were attacked by the Russians refuses to admit that we're still being attacked by the Russians and refuses to do anything to protect us from that attack on our next election which is ongoing his own intelligence agencies say that the Russian attack is continuing and will continue and he is they commit well he is that the president is oath of offices to preserve protect and defend the Constitution there is nothing more central to the Constitution than democratic with a small d election so we can govern ourselves and he is refusing to take any meaningful steps in fact any steps to protect our elections and that is that is the real issue now not who have done what when that's a subsidiary issue all right thanks man Jerry Nadler thank you so much it's great to have me on we appreciate it so Shannon what happened at the White House how did that get set up how did we get to a point where the president actually turned the microphone over to people who would have opposing views give them a huge bully pulpit and what's the outcome up the White House knew that they needed to do more on this issue they made those visits on Friday night I was traveling with the president that night when he went to the hospital when he went and met with law enforcement they did not get the type of media attention they were hoping from that that did not have the effect of showing a president who was consoler in chief they knew they had to do more on this over the weekend they were putting together a schedule he's meeting with state and local officials again today to try and keep the momentum going on this but they definitely realized over the weekend that this was an issue they had to get out over the weekend like talked to in the White House said he wants to do something on this he wants to do background checks he wants to ban bump stocks and they were actually talking about assault weapon so-called assault weapon bans I'm sure they won't get that for but I was surprised what what can you tell me about their thinking and how far they're willing to go I mean it's definitely a different conversation than after the Las Vegas shooting where the line was it's too soon to talk about this maybe something on bump spot stocks but then nothing happened for months and months and tell the next shooting there's definitely a different tone but I based on my reporting I don't think anything's going as far as Democrats or gun control advocates would like to see it and I think the president made that clear he raised intentionally this issue of getting rid of gun-free school zones of arming teachers he said he knew that was controversial he put that out there that was a message that was heard well by conservatives by his base that he was not talking about banning assault weapons or an ar-15 he was focused on mental health yes maybe some changes to background checks but that was still there guy he was still talking about this issue of arming teachers he just tweeted I never said give teachers guns like was stated on fake news at CNN and at NBC what I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience only the best 20% of teachers a lot would now be able to is he not done yeah I mean maybe just up there not being able to yeah so anyway the president has moved though again I it pains me to do this but I president the president has moved on background checks again I I cannot tell you how much resistance I mean personally I've received as a former NRA approved congressman to talk about background checks that's something I could never talk about nice talking about that bump stocks didn't move after Vegas they're talking about it now there is some movement I think what happens in the next few days in the next week is gonna be very crucial because like we saw with this immigration debate remember the moment when they open the cameras and then the the hardliners on immigration got to his ear so no doubt he will be hearing from his allies who are not for background checks it is CPAC is in town he will be attending that and speaking there so people are going to get to his ear and I would love to see where we are next week I think that will be a better educator the president will be is it going to be little Miller is it gonna be Steve Ben and is it gonna be seen back or is it gonna be those parents and those kids that you had into your home that you listen to what their gut wrenching stories their rage their profound fear president who understands television and messaging that's a that they have something powerful that he understands if I'm at home with the White House though you talked about CPAC being in town I would be horrified by the clips I'm serious that could possibly come out of CPAC somebody being extraordinarily insensitive maybe it's said Gorka will be speaking on girls undoubtedly yeah well you have the sheriff arpaio well Clark I mean and so many other people what if they something say something outrageous and then everybody's considerable or you're really gonna go speak at CPAC that's actually any good that was done yesterday you speak it's a panic well he is but I'm just saying if if that's not handled correctly that's that is a real problem Shannon Pepys thank you very much coming thanks for checking out MSNBC on YouTube and make sure you subscribe
