Sandra: THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. MOMENTS AGO THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED IT WILL SUBPOENA PETER STRZOK. THAT'S THE FBI AGENT REMOVED FROM THE RUSSIAN PROBE AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THOSE ANTI-TRUMPET TEXTS THAT HE EXCHANGED WITH FBI LAWYER LISA PAGE WHO WAS ALSO HIS LOVER. IF STRZOK WERE TO TESTIFY, SOMETHING'S ATTORNEY INDICATES HE'S WILLING TO DO, IT COULDN'T IMPACT THAT BY HIS PROBE AND CONGRESSMAN JOINS US NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TONIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS NEWS? HE'S OFFICIALLY BEEN SUBPOENAED TO TESTIFY. I KNEW HE WAS GOING TO APPEAR ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WE INVITED HIM TO APPEAR VOLUNTARILY OR BE SUBPOENAED. HE ORIGINALLY SAID HE WOULD, AND NOW HE'S BEEN SUBPOENAED. HE'S A CENTRAL WITNESS IN VOLTA HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL INVESTIGATION AND OF THE TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION CASE THAT BECAME THE SPECIAL COUNSEL MATTER. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE HIM APPEAR AND EXPLAIN THESE TEXT MESSAGES AS WELL AS HIS ACTIONS TAKEN IN BOTH OF THESE MATTERS. SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE WILL EVENTUALLY APPEAR AND EITHER ANSWER QUESTIONS, OR ASSERT HIS FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS. EITHER WAY IT WILL TELL US A LOT ABOUT PETER STRZOK. Sandra: OF COURSE WE HAVE ALL HAD THE CHANCE TO SEE AND HEAR THIS TEXT MESSAGES BY NOW AND WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANTI-TRUMPET BIAS IN THOSE TEXT MESSAGES, AND A LOT OF IT. HOWEVER, THE IG REPORT FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THIS USED IN DECISION-MAKING. I THINK THE INSPECTOR GENERAL EQUIVOCATED A LITTLE BIT FROM THE WRITTEN WORD. HE CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT PETER STRZOK HAD AN ASTONISHING LEVEL OF BIAS. HE ALSO TODAY INDICATED THAT IN AT LEAST ONE INSTANCE, PETER STRZOK ALLOWED THAT ACTION TO INFLUENCE HIS BIAS AS IT RELATES TO THE RECOVERY OF 100,000 EMAILS ON ANTHONY WEINER'S AND HUMA ABEDIN'S LAPTOP THAT WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. SO I THOUGHT HE OPENED THE DOOR TODAY TO THE IDEA THAT BIAS REALLY DID IMPACT BOTH OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT INVESTIGATIONS. SO YOU KNOW, WE ALL WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO THE TRUTH. I THINK THAT PETER STRZOK'S CREDIBILITY ULTIMATELY WILL IMPACT NOT JUST THE HILLARY CLINTON EMAIL MATTER, BUT THE TRUMP/RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. SANDRA, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU UNDERSTAND IS THAT PETER STRZOK WAS THE PERSON OF THE FBI PUT IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING DONALD TRUMP. THE GUY WHO HATED DONALD TRUMP IS MUCH AS ANYONE WHO'S HAD NOT A SINGLE AMERICAN SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM AND TALKED ABOUT GETTING HIM IMPEACHED ONCE HE BECAME PRESIDENT WAS THE ONE COLLECTING EVIDENCE AND FORMULATING A PLAN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. SO HE NEEDS TO, AND ACCOUNT FOR THE THINGS HE HAS SAID AND THE THINGS HE HAS DONE AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE HIM DO THAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. Sandra: DOES AT A AND SURPRISE YOU THAT PETER STRZOK STILL HAS A JOB AT THE FBI? OBVIOUSLY HE'S BEEN PULLED OFF THE CASE, BUT HE STILL THERE. I THINK WE ARE ALL AT A LOSS AS TO WHY HE IS STILL AT THE FBI. THE BEST WAY THAT CHRIS WRAY CAN DEFEND THE 13,000 AGENTS, MANY OF THEM WERE VERY GOOD AT BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN THAT GO EVERY DAY TO KHABAROVSK COUNTRY SAFE, IS TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE TO REALLY BAD ACTORS, AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME, THERE'S NO QUESTION AND AT THE ASTONISHING LEVEL OF BIAS AND HATRED CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED AND EXPLAINED. Sandra: THAT WAS NOT JUST
