HE SURROUNDED BY ALL THE OTHER

84
00:02:22,466 --> 00:02:27,271
FOLKS WHO ARE NEVER-TRUMPERS.

85
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,739
PATRICK MORRISSEY HAS NEVER BEEN

NOVEMBER ELECTION, PATRICK

92
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:38,983
MORRISEY WAS DENYING AFFILIATION

93
00:02:38,983 --> 00:02:41,285
WITH DONALD TRUMP.

94
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:41,952
DONALD TRUMP, OUR PRESIDENT

95
00:02:41,952 --> 00:02:45,189
NEEDS A TRUSTED PARTNER AND I AM

00:02:52,496 --> 00:02:54,365
THEN BECOMES, YOU USED TO BE A

WHAT CHANGED YOUR MIND?

106
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:59,170
WHY DID YOU BECOME A REPUBLICAN

107
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,039
A DEMOCRAT A COUPLE OF TIMES?

108
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,442
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

109
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:07,278
WEST VIRGINIA HAS --

110
00:03:07,278 --> 00:03:08,746
WEST VIRGINIA VOTED FOR

111
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:09,747
DONALD TRUMP OVERWHELMINGLY.

112
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:10,548
PATRICK MORRISEY ACTUALLY STOOD

113
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:11,849
NEXT TO ME FOUR YEARS AGO AND

114
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:14,885
ENDORSED MY CANDIDACY FOR THE

115
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:15,886
U.S. CONGRESS.

116
00:03:15,886 --> 00:03:17,321
MY PAST DOESN'T BOTHER HIM BACK

117
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,022
THEN WHEN HE ENDORSED ME AND

118
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:20,257
SAID I WAS GREAT FOR

119
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:21,425
WEST VIRGINIA TO REPRESENT THEM

120
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:23,994
IN WASHINGTON.

121
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:26,030
WHAT IS CHANGE SINCE PATRICK

I AM ASKING WHY YOUR CHANGE OF

127
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,538
HEART, WHY DID YOU SWITCH FROM

128
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:36,640
BEING A DEMOCRAT TO THE

129
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,475
REPUBLICAN?

130
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:39,477
>> BECAUSE I AM THE TRUE

131
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:40,277
WEST VIRGINIA.

132
00:03:40,277 --> 00:03:41,278
I'M THE WEST VIRGINIA STORY,

133
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:43,747
STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE.

134
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:45,683
BARACK OBAMA WAS DEVASTATING FOR

135
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,117
WEST VIRGINIA.

136
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:47,651
HE PUT LITERALLY TENS AND

137
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,153
THOUSANDS OF COAL MINERS OUT OF

138
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:49,887

DEMAND, IT'S OUTRAGEOUS.

141
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,261
I CAN'T BE A PART OF THAT.

142
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:58,662
I'M PROUD TO BE A REPUBLICAN,

143
00:03:58,662 --> 00:03:59,663
PROUD TO BE A CONSERVATIVE,

144
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,565
PROUD TO BE THE ONLY ONE IN THIS

145
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,667
RACE WHO ACTUALLY SUPPORTED

146
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:04,435
DONALD TRUMP AND IS WORKING WITH

147
00:04:04,435 --> 00:00:00,000
HIM EACH AND EVERY DAY.
