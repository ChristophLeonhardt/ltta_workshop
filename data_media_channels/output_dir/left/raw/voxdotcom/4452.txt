00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,389
Consider the squirrel. Squirrels are
everywhere and they're pretty cute, but

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,220
are they valuable? Not really right?
Believe it or not, medieval Europeans

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,309
used to use red squirrel pelts as
currency, just as you and I might

4
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:15,030
exchange dollar bills today. It's one of
the many surprisingly different ways

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,539
humans have transacted with one another
throughout history. It might seem crazy, but

6
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,020
when you think about how we're now able
to pay each other digitally in minutes

7
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,840
cash might be going away the red
squirrel sooner than you think.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,260
The history of money is a movement from
trading stuff you can use, to trading

9
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,059
stuff that's symbolic and now even
virtual. Nowadays, you can send money

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,140
safely and easily to pretty much anyone
you know in a matter of minutes, straight

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,010
from your personal banking app. So how
did we get here? Somewhere in the middle

12
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,750
of this history is the red squirrel or
Sciurus Vulgaris, which formed the basis

13
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,320
for the medieval economy of Finland and
Russia. In fact the Finnish word for

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,320
money, "raha" comes from squirrels. But they also

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,210
became a symbol, a collective belief, a
currency. A tikkuri  was 10 squirrel pelts

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,290
and a kiihetelys was four times that and
while values changed, at one point a

17
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,180
hundred pelts could get you a whole cow.
But, big drawback: it took time to catch

18
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:12,540
them and while squirrel currency
eventually went out of favour as metal

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,520
coins appeared, there were still squirrel
pelt currency exchange charts even in

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,820
1926. Despite what the internet might
tell you though and we asked the Finnish

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,009
Embassy about this and they laughed at
us.

22
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,180
Squirrels are no longer accepted as
payment their, FYI. A squirrel economy

23
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,720
is pretty weird, but humans everywhere
have a history of paying with strange

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,140
things. Things that are really just
symbols we believed to be worth

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,270
something.
These cowry shells spread across much

26
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,320
of the ancient trading lands, from China
to India, to Eastern Africa. Salt or

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,490
Salarium Argentum, was paid out to
soldiers in Rome and it's the reason you

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,689
now get a salary by the way. In Central
America the cocoa bean understandably

29
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:54,329
became prized. Even in modern Italy and
this is true, 17,000 tons of Parmesan

30
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,909
Reggiano cheese are kept
bank vaults as collateral. Besides the

31
00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,350
squirrel, the strangest / most symbolic /
most unwieldy was the rai stone, of the

32
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,549
Solomon Islands. It had to be gathered
from islands hundreds of miles away and

33
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:11,720
they were so huge that they occasionally
capsized canoes. Of course it's tempting

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,230
to laugh at our ancestors for paying
with such weird things, but we're not

35
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,340
really all that different. For centuries
for us in the United States, gold was the

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,390
standard currency and some still obsess
over it, but it's really just a symbol too - not

37
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,650
that far removed from a pelt. And the
same is basically true with paper money.

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,370
It's important, but ultimately works as a
representation of a country's stability,

39
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,989
like melting gold or hauling huge
limestone tablets across oceans or

40
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,940
catching 40 squirrels, cash takes time.
A study suggests that Americans waste

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,040
200 billion dollars worth of our time
per year just getting it out of ATMs, so

42
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,519
where does that leave us? Today we continue to go even faster and

43
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,480
more symbolic in an era where you can
just send money in minutes from your

44
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,880
bank account to a friend's bank account
on your phone.

45
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,530
Paper money may soon seem just as silly
as paying with a squirrel, so the more

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:03,820
transfers, the more money available in
your bank account within minutes and

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:00:00,000
less fur. The red squirrel would probably
be happy.
