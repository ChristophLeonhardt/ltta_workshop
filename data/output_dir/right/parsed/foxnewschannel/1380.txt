MORE CONSERVATIVE NEWS CHANNEL.
STEVE.
STEVE: THANK YOU.
BACK WITH US IS KENNEDY AND
CANDACE OWEN.
ARE WE MAKING TOO MUCH OF SHOWS?
>> I THINK IF YOU RELY ON THE
POLITICAL WORLD VIEW OF JIMMY
KIMMEL OR STEVEN COBERT YOU WILL
LEAVE OUT HALF OF THE COUNTRY.
NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE
POLITICAL.
NOT EVERY SITCOM HAS TO BE
POLITICAL.
IF THERE IS A STRIPE THAT'S
SHOWN IN THIS FORUM, THEY ARE
NOT ALL GOING TO BE LIBERAL.
HALF OF THE COUNTRY ACTUALLY
ISN'T.
THEY MAY HATE EACH OTHER BUT
DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME
THING.
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO
TAMP DOWN ROSANNE'S POLITICAL
FIRE.
SHE TWEETED BACK NO, YOU ARE
NOT.
STEVE: CANDACE, IN TERMS OF THE
PEOPLE RESPONDING TO YOUR
MESSAGE AND MOVEMENT YOU ARE
BUILDING.
WHAT IS THEIR TAKE ON THE MEDIA
LANDSCAPE.
DO THEY HEAR WHAT THEY BELIEVE
REFLECTED IN THE CULTURE OR NOT
REALLY?
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.
CULTURE USED TO PROVIDE THE
WINDOW INTO THE HEARTS AND MINDS
OF PEOPLE.
IT NO LONGER DOES.
IT FEELS LIKE WE ARE BEING
PUNISHED FOR NOT AGREEING WITH
THESE HOSTS AND PLATFORMS.
THIS IS WHY PEOPLE ARE STARTING
TO TURN IT OFF.
WITH THE REVIALS YOU SEE PERSON
PEOPLE SAYING THANK GOODNESS
SOMEONE IS STANDING UP FOR MY
IDEAS AND WHAT I BELIEVE IN.
IF THE MEDIA DOESN'T DO
SOMETHING DIFFERENTLY.
IF THEY DON'T STOP SELLING THE
STORY INSTEAD OF PROMOTING IT
THEN PEOPLE WILL TURN IT OFF.
STEVE: IT'S WEIRD HOW IT'S BEEN
SO OVERWHELMINGLY ON THE LEFT.
YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THEY
COME IN REBELLING AND THAT'S A
LIBERTARIAN MESSAGE.
IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY AN
ASSUMPTION THAT THE MUSIC
INDUSTRY ARE ON THE LEFT.
>> A LOT OF TIMES, I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU ARE HEARD OF FREE MARKET
LYRICS, THEY ARE BORING.
>> WHEN THEY WRITE THESE
POLITICAL SONGS, THEY ARE PRETTY
AWFUL.
I WOULDN'T NAME NAMES.
YOU WILL FIND THESE THEMES IN
COUNTRY MUSIC AND SOMETIMES A
BETTER VENUE FOR STORY TELLING.
THERE ARE SOME LIBERTARIANS IN
MUSIC AND SOME THAT FIGHT BACK.
WHEN I SAY WHEN KANYE PRAISED
CANDACE OWENS I DON'T DOUBT THE
SEN
HIN
HIS REALNESS BUT HE REALIZED HE
WAS SUPPRESSED.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE THE
PRESIDENT IN ORDER TO EXPRESS
INDIVIDUALISTIC THOUGHTS THAT
MAY DIFFER FROM THIS INSIDIOUS
GROUP THING.
IT'S SMOTHERING THOUGHT AND
ARTISTRY.
>> CANDACE, LAST WORD TO YOU ON
THIS.
THAT WAS WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO
THE KANYE REACTION TO WHAT YOU
SAID.
IT WASN'T ENDORSING EVERYTHING
YOU ARE ARGUING FOR.
HE SAID HANG ON A SECOND LET'S
JUST SAY WHAT WE THINK.
THAT'S A FOUNDATIONAL THING WE
SHOULD AGREE ABOUT.
THAT'S THE MOST YOU CAN EXPECT
FROM THE CULTURAL AND
ENTERTAINMENT WORLD?
>> EXACTLY, KENNEDY HIT THE NAIL
ON THE HEAD.
ARTIST THINK THEY ARE FREE BUT
THEY ARE NOT.
KANYE SAYING THIS FIVE WORD
TWEET SHOWS HOW NOT FREE THEY
ARE.
YOU WILL BE SHOCKED HOW MANY
ARTIST AND ACTORS HAVE WRITTEN
TO ME THAT SAID THEY SUPPORT ME
BUT THEY ARE SCARED TO DO SO
PUBLICLY.
THERE IS A PRISON THAT EXISTS IN
HOLLYWOOD.
THERE IS A MENTAL PRISON.
PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO EXPRESS
THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEIR JOBS
ARE ON THE LINE.
I ALWAYS COMPARE IT TO BEING GAY
IN THE 80s.
STEVE: IF YOU KEEP GOING I THINK
THOSE PEOPLE BIT BY BIT WILL BE
ABLE TO COME OUT IF WE CAN USE
