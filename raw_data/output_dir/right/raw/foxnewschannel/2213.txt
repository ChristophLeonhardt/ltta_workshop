TRUE, BE WARNED, MUELLER IS

THE PRESIDENT OF THE

UNITED STATES.

28
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,752
WHICH MEANS TWO THINGS, ONE, HE

29
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:49,386
HAS NOTHING.

30
00:00:49,386 --> 00:00:50,921
AND TWO, IT PROVES EVERYTHING I

31
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,157
HAVE BEEN SAYING ABOUT HIM AND

32
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:54,758
ANDREW WEISSMANN AND COMPANY.

35
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:58,095
WATCH THIS.

36
00:00:58,095 --> 00:01:02,533
>> THE QUESTIONS ARE INARTFULLY

37
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,003
DRAWN, THEY ARE WRITTEN AS

38
00:01:06,136 --> 00:01:07,538
THEY ARE NOT CROSS EXAMINATION

39
00:01:07,538 --> 00:01:09,340
QUESTIONS.

40
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,342
THEY ARE NOT SHARP QUESTIONS

41
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:12,076
DESIGNED TO CONFRONT AND TEST.

42
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:13,844
THEY ARE REALLY DESIGNED TO LET

43
00:01:13,844 --> 00:01:15,179
HIM RAMBLE AND TALK.

44
00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:17,982
I SUSPECT THAT THAT IS THE

45
00:01:17,982 --> 00:01:19,083
STRATEGY OF THE SPECIAL COUNSEL,

46
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,185
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE DATA

47
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,353

48
00:01:22,353 --> 00:01:22,753
WEAKNESS.

49
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:25,356
IF THEY WERE TO ASK HIM DIRECT,

50
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,523
TOUGH, QUESTIONS TO WHICH YOU

51
00:01:26,523 --> 00:01:28,926
COULD ANSWER YES OR NO, THAT

52
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:29,960

00:01:31,962 --> 00:01:32,730

APPARENTLY PROCESSED TO DO ABOUT

00:01:49,213 --> 00:01:49,947
WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS THINKING

63
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:54,418
WHEN HE FIRED COMEY OR FLYNN OR

64
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:59,857

WHEN DID THINKING OR THOUGHTS

91
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:49,339
EVER BECOME A CRIME?

92
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:50,507
WHEN DID THE UNITED STATES START

REGULATING WHAT YOU MAY OR MAY

94
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,745

ARE WE GOING TO CRIMINALIZE

96
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:57,114
THOUGHTS?

97
00:02:57,114 --> 00:03:00,150
THIS LIST OF INSANE, JUVENILE

98
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,552
RIDICULOUS QUESTIONS GOES ON

THOUGHT PROCESS.

108
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,369
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

109
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:22,706

110
00:03:22,706 --> 00:03:23,640
ABOUT RUSSIA COLLUSION AND

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,708
INVESTIGATION.

117
00:03:30,614 --> 00:03:33,183
HE SAID THE PRESIDENT SHOULD

00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:34,751
ONLY AGREE TO A MUELLER

119
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,820

120
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,422
GETS THE HILLARY CLINTON

121
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:38,789
TREATMENT.

122
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:41,024
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

123
00:03:41,024 --> 00:03:43,627
>> IF TRUMP COULD SECURE THE

124
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:44,294
SAME IDENTICAL CIRCUMSTANCES

125
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:45,529
THAT WERE GRANTED TO

126
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:46,330
HILLARY CLINTON, THEN WHY NOT

127
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,297
SIT DOWN FOR THE INTERVIEW AND

128
00:03:47,297 --> 00:03:50,701
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS?

129
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:51,902
BUT OF COURSE I SPEAK

130
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:52,870
FACETIOUSLY, BECAUSE EVERYBODY

131
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,604
KNOWS THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT

132
00:03:53,604 --> 00:03:56,106

ABSOLUTELY GET THE HILLARY

141
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:11,188

143
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:14,124

AND OH COMING OUT, SOMEBODY WITH

152
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,740

00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,954
PEOPLE, LOTS OF CONSERVATIVES

160
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:44,922
THAT CAN INTERVIEW.

161
00:04:44,922 --> 00:04:46,089
NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.

162
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:47,724
WE KNOW THAT.

163
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,160
WE KNOW SADLY IN AMERICA WE HAVE

164
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,929
A 2-TEAR JUSTICE SYSTEM, NOT

165
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:54,565
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW.

166
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:55,732
