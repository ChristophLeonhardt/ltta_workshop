“What you see in the
video is the shooter
talking about how he’s
going to get to the school
in an Uber,
what time he’s going
leave, then what’s
going to happen when
he gets to the school,
what type of weapon
he’s going to have.
And then he actually mimics
the sound of a shooting
at the end of the video.”
“He comes off as very callous
and pleased with himself.
He’s also using violence to
enhance his sense of self
by becoming famous,
and this is something
that we’ve seen in other
school shooters as well.”
“It’s becoming very common
for these individuals
to publicize their event. We
refer to it as leakage, which
is communication to a
third party of intent
to attack, wanting it
to typically be
discovered within hours
or days of the event itself.”
“The way in which school
shooters broadcast the plans
beforehand differs: For some
it’s video, for some it’s social media posts,
for some it’s one-on-one
conversation with a friend
or someone they know online,
for some they indicate
their plans or intentions
through homework assignments
and through poetry
that they hand in to
an English teacher, for example.”
"When I first
did the F.B.I.’s research
on the first 18 shootings,
which included shootings
in the 1980s and the 1990s
and included Columbine,
the only one where I recalled
where there was a manifesto
video was Columbine.
My recommendation was that
those videotapes never be
released to the public ever.
And they never were, because
they were so chilling
and so matter of fact.
And so compelling
that it could
cause someone else to consider
carrying out that act.
People never got a
hold of those tapes.
But so much other
information was
released on that shooting
that it has taken on a folk hero
status, unfortunately.”
“Not all school
shooters have role models.
But when they do
have a role model
it is most commonly
the perpetrators
of the attack at Columbine.”
“Many school shooters
have researched how
Columbine was carried out.
Researched the
motivations. And we
see that intense
media coverage
of any one of these
school shootings
adds to that research base
for future school shooters.”
“There have been over 80
events since Columbine
in 1999 in the United States
that have been inspired
by that particular event.
And these individuals
will typically
study previous attackers.
They want to do two things:
They want to imitate
those attackers,
and then also they want
to do them one better.”
“We have data going back now
20 years that shows in about 60%
of these cases, these individuals
will leak their intent.”
“The theme of these videos
tends to remain the same:
This is who I am.
This is what I’m going to do.
This is how I’m
going to do it.
And here are the
reasons that I’m
going to do it. 
So it’s almost a script
that they all follow.”
“And the manifesto may
serve several purposes.
In some cases, it is
to let themselves be
known to go down in history.
In other cases, it may be
used to justify the attack
by focusing on how
they’ve been victimized
by various injustices.
Some shooters use
it as an opportunity
to engage in some sort
of social critique.”
“This video like
so many others,
whether it’s in video
form or social media
post or direct conversation
or communication,
to me it often signals
what we see in a suicide note.
And the reason why it’s
important to think about it
from a suicide
note perspective
is that we have so many
tools and resources
available to help
someone who is suicidal
and we often don’t
think to use them when
we’re worried about
a school threat.
And so many cases,
it’s exactly
the type of
intervention or resource
that can make a critical
difference and prevent harm.”
