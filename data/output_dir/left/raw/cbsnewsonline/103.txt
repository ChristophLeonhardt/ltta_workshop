NOT DUE TO A LACK OF EFFORT OR

67
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,906
LACK OF RESOURCES.

68
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,341

FACTS, RESULTS, AND CONCLUSIONS.

78
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,188
I UNDERSTAND THIS IS FRUSTRATING

79
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:37,957
FOR MANY IN THE PUBLIC AND THE

80
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,093
MEDIA, BUT FEEL THIS IS

81
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,528
NECESSARY FOR OUR INVESTIGATION.

82
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,762
OUR POSITION HAS ALSO NOT

83
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,064
CHANGED IN THAT IF WE EVALUATE A

84
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,165
PIECE OF INFORMATION AND FEEL

85
00:02:46,165 --> 00:02:48,768
THE RELEASE COULD LEAD US TO

00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:54,174
MOLLIE, WE WILL DO SO

87
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:54,474

AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THERE,

89
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,543
ARE MEDIA REPORTS REGARDING

90
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,578
DETAILS THAT THE DID FCI HAS NOT

91
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:58,845
CONFIRMED.

92
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,980
THE FACT THAT WE DON'T CONFIRM

93
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,649
OR DENY THE DETAILS IS NOT AN

94
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:03,716
INDICATOR OF THE TRUTH OR

95
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,117
FALSITY.

96
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,885
WE HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT SOCIAL

97
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,353
MEDIA POSTINGS AND THE

98
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,455
INVESTIGATION AND WHETHER THEY

99
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,089
ARE BENEFICIAL OR NOT.

100
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,158
THE POSTINGS ARE BENEFICIAL AND

101
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,660
THAT THEY KEEP THE INVESTIGATION

102
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,794
IN THE PUBLIC EYE, HOWEVER, I

103
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:17,864
WOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THE

104
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,599
POSTINGS ARE OFTEN RUMORED AND

105
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,633
UNCONFIRMED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.

106
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,034
AS A RESULT OF THIS

107
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:22,635
INVESTIGATION, MANY QUESTIONS

108
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,604

THOSE 26 CASES DATE BACK AS FAR

138
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,702

00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:05,598
CONFERENCE WILL BE POSTED ON THE

193
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:05,898
DPS WEBSITE.

194
00:06:05,898 --> 00:06:07,300
WE HOPE TO HAVE MORE INFORMATION

195
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,501
TO PROVIDE TO YOU NEXT TUESDAY.

196
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:11,237
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, I'LL

197
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,373
BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS THEM.

198
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,441
>> TED WILLIAMS, IT HAS BEEN

199
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,010
REPORTED THAT A RED SHIRT HAS

200
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,445
BEEN FOUND AND I WAS WONDERING,

201
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:21,013
CAN YOU SHED ANY LIGHT ON

202
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,449
WHETHER A RED SHIRT HAS BEEN

203
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,951
FOUND AND WHETHER THERE IS ANY

204
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,719
KIND OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

205
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,690
RED SHIRT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

206
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,125
FOUND AND MOLLIE AND AT THIS

207
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:34,994
STAGE, DO YOU HAVE ANY SUSPECTS?

208
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:36,596
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION

209
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:37,763
WITH ME TODAY ON A RED SHIRT

210
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,332
BEING FOUND AND THAT IS NOT TO

211
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,534
SAY THAT THERE WAS ONE FOUND OR

212
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,469
NOT FOUND.

213
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,004
I JUST DON'T HAVE THAT

214
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:45,304
INFORMATION.

215
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:46,639
AS FAR AS SUSPECTS GO, WE'RE

216
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,908
STILL, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

217
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,176
ALL POSSIBILITIES.

218
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,111
I'M NOT IN A POSITION RIGHT NOW

219
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,213
TO SAY WE HAVE SUSPECTS, WE

220
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,848
DON'T HAVE SUSPECTS, PERSONS OF

221
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,950
INTEREST OR ANYTHING ELSE.

222
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,785
>> INITIALLY, IT WAS REPORTED BY

223
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:02,822
YOUR AGENCY AND OTHERS THAT SHE

224
00:07:02,822 --> 00:07:04,991
WAS WEARING A BLACK SPORTS TOP.

225
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,826
NOW NEWER DESCRIPTION THAT YOU

226
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:10,863
REFERRED THAT SAID SHE WAS IN A

227
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,296
PINK SPORTS TOP.

228
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,966
THAT MAY BE CONFUSING TO PEOPLE

229
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:14,833
OR THE PUBLIC.

230
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,635
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DISCREPANCY

231
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:15,835
THERE?

232
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,169
>> NO BUT I CAN LOOK INTO THAT

233
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,270
AND LET YOU KNOW.

234
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,940
>> EVEN ON THE POSTER IT SAYS

235
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,340
BLACK SPORTS TOP.

236
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,508
>> I CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT BUT I'LL

237
00:07:22,508 --> 00:07:24,644
LOOK INTO THAT AND GET BACK TO

238
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:30,416
YOU IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR

239
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:30,716
INFORMATION.

240
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:31,283
>> IS -- A SUSPECT?

241
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:32,518
>> WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION TO

242
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,453
SAY WHO IS A SUSPECT, WHO ISN'T

243
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:37,924
A SUSPECT OR THAT THERE ARE

244
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:38,191
SUSPECTS.

245
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,825
>> HAVE YOU EMPLOYED DIVERS TO

246
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:40,592
SEARCH AREA PONDS?

247
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:42,762
>> WE HAVE BEEN SEARCHING PONDS,

248
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:46,566
FIELDS AND EVEN FROM THE AIR.

249
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,267
WE'VE BEEN DOING SEARCHES IN

250
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:48,834
MANY DIFFERENT MANNERS.

251
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:50,636
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS

252
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:53,539
FAR AS IF WE'RE USING DIVERS.

253
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,175
MY ASSUMPTION WOULD BE IF WE'RE

254
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,243
SEARCHING PONDS, WE'VE BEEN

255
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:57,576
USING DIVERS.

256
00:07:57,576 --> 00:08:03,082
>> IS THERE ANY THOUGHT ABOUT

257
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:03,950
RESTARTING THE SEARCH EFFORTS

258
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,317
WITH VOLUNTEERS.

259
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,018
WOULD THAT DO ANY GOOD TO ASK

260
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,887
FOR THE VOLUNTEERS AGAIN AND

261
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,955
SEARCH NEW AREAS FURTHER AWAY?

262
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,390
>> I LEAVE THAT UP TO THE

263
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,092
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM TO DETERMINE

264
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,394
WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE FOR THE

265
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,897
INVESTIGATION ON ANY GIVEN DAY.

266
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,765
THEY HAVE THE LATITUDE.

267
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:20,766
THEY HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION

268
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,201
AT THE AVAILABILITY TO MAKE THE

269
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,337
DECISIONS AND WE LEAVE THE

270
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,438
DECISIONS UP TO THE

271
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:25,938
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM.

272
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,173
>> SINCE YOU RAISED THE REWARD

273
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,842
AMOUNT, HAVE MORE TIPS BEEN

274
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,109
COMING IN?

275
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,711
>> TIPS HAVE BEEN COMING IN

276
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,544
REGULARLY.

277
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:33,679
THE PACE TO WHICH THEY'RE COMING

278
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,182
IN, I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER IT

279
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,283
INCREASED, DECREASED, STAYED THE

280
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,985
SAME SINCE THE REWARD AMOUNT HAS

281
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:39,284
BEEN UPPED.

282
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:43,188
>> HAVE YOU FOUND ANY ARTICLES

283
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:44,222
OF CLOTHING OR ANY PHYSICAL

284
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:44,490
EVIDENCE?

285
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,292
>> THAT WILL BE ANOTHER AREA

286
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,926
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DELVE INTO

287
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,362
AT THIS TIME BECAUSE IT WOULD

288
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,932
SPEAK TO THE RESULTS OF AN

289
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:53,365
INVESTIGATIVE LEAD.

290
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,135
>> CAN I CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE

291
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,738
NO SUSPECTS AND NO PERSONS OF

292
00:08:58,738 --> 00:08:59,271
INTERESTS?

293
00:08:59,271 --> 00:08:59,471
>> NO.

294
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:03,009
REGARDLESS OF WHAT I JUST SAID

295
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,809
OR YOU INTERPRETED.

296
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,745
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK WHEN DID

297
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:06,812
WE HAVE SUSPECTS OR PERSONS OF

298
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:07,279
INTEREST.

299
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,982
>> ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAVE NO

300
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,417
SOLID LEADS AT THIS POINT?

301
00:09:11,417 --> 00:09:13,752
I THINK ALL LEADS ARE VALUABLE.

302
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:17,089
HOW YOU DEFINE SOLID WOULD BE UP

303
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:17,522
FOR INTERPRETATION.

304
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,057
WE VIEW ALL LEADS AS VALUABLE.

305
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:20,960
AS THEY COME IN, THEY'RE

306
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,294
EVALUATED AND PRIORITIZED AND

307
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:24,897
WE'RE LOOKING INTO EVERYTHING AT

308
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,497
THIS POINT.

309
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,500
>> ARE YOU CLOSER TO SOLVING

310
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,635
THIS NOW THAN TWO WEEKS AGO?

311
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,669
>> THAT WOULD BE A CONCLUSION

312
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:31,504
BASED ON THE INVESTIGATION AND

313
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:38,644
I'M NOT GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT

314
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:38,977
AT THIS POINT.

315
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:42,280
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

316
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,082
>> I'M SORRY.

317
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:44,382
REPEAT THAT?

318
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:47,219
>> CAN YOU CLARIFY IF MOLLIE --

319
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,120
OR WAS SHE ABDUCTED OR

320
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,621
DISAPPEARED?

321
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,723
>> I'M CONFIDENT WE HAVE A SOLID

322
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:51,424
TIMELINE THAT THEY'RE WORKING

323
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,224
OFF OF.

324
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,826
AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT READY TO

325
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:55,494
DISCLOSE WHAT THE TIMELINE IS

326
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,964
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHAT YOUR

327
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:58,264
QUESTION IS.

328
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,098
>> SINCE THE REWARD WAS

329
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,033
INCREASED, CAN YOU CHARACTERIZE

330
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:03,835
THE KIND OF TIPS THAT HAVE COME

331
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:04,970
IN?

332
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,605
HAVE THERE BEEN DIFFERENT TYPES

333
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:11,943
OF TIPS AS A REWARD OR RECOVERY

334
00:10:11,943 --> 00:10:12,711
FUND HAVE PROMISED ANYTHING?

335
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,747
>> I REALLY DON'T HAVE THE

336
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:19,085
INFORMATION WITH ME RIGHT NOW TO

337
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,720
SAY IF ANY OF THE LEADS PROVIDED

338
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,388
ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT OR NOT.

339
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:25,457
LEADS ARE A GOOD THING.

340
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,760
AS TIPS COME IN THEY GENERATE

341
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:27,960
LEADS.

342
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,161
I WOULD SAY ALL LEADS ARE

343
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,763
IMPORTANT AND THEY'RE ALL BEING

344
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:31,030
LOOKED AT.

345
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,598
>> IS THERE ANY SIGN OF A

346
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,600
DISTURBANCE INSIDE THE HOME?

347
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,367
ANYTHING OUT OF PLACE?

348
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,836
ANYTHING UNUSUAL AT HOME?

349
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:37,803
>> AGAIN, THAT IS ANOTHER AREA

350
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,306
THAT WOULD CAUSE ME TO COMMENT

351
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,207
ON THE RESULT OF AN

352
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,008
INVESTIGATIVE LEAD AND I'M NOT

353
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,510
GOING TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME.

354
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,448
>> CAN YOU EXPAND ON THE SEARCH

355
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,416
THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY?

356
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,251
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN

357
00:10:52,251 --> 00:10:52,518
SPECIFIC?

358
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:52,718
>> NO.

359
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:54,019
AS I'VE MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, AS

360
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:56,689
LEADS COME IN AND INFORMATION IS

361
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,590
EVALUATED, THE INVESTIGATIVE

362
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,559
TEAM RESPONDS TO THOSE AND

363
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,026
PRIORITIZES THOSE.

364
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:03,129
I EXPECT THE SEARCHES TO

365
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,697
CONTINUE WHETHER THEY'RE FROM

366
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:07,399
THE AIR, ON BODIES OF WATER OR

367
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,634
IN FIELDS, WHEREVER THE LEADS

368
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,134
MAY TAKE THEM.

369
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:12,338
>> ARE YOU TREATING THIS AS A

370
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,572
STRANGER ABDUCTION?

371
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:15,641
>> WE'RE TREATING THIS AS A

372
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,542
MISSING PERSONS INVESTIGATION

373
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,743
AND ARE TRYING TO FIND MOLLIE.

374
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,348
THAT CONTINUES TO BE OUR FOCUS

375
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,617
IS TO FIND MOLLIE.

376
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:29,688
>> CAN YOU VERIFY THE IMPORTANCE

377
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,390
OF EVERY PASSING HOUR?

378
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,159
>> IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR

379
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,426
EVERYBODY.

380
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,994
IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR THE

381
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,095
INVESTIGATIVE TEAM, FRUSTRATING

382
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,930
FOR US AND PARTICULARLY

383
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,665
FRUSTRATING FOR THE FAMILY AND

384
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,400
FRIENDS OF MOLLIE.

385
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,235
OBVIOUSLY NOBODY WANTS TO FIND

386
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:45,070
MOLLIE MORE THAN THESE FOLKS

387
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,708
RIGHT HERE AND WE'RE INCLUDED IN

388
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,075
THAT GROUP.

389
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,210
IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING.

390
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,946
IT HASN'T SLOWED OUR EFFORTS.

391
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:55,514
WE HAVE NOT SLOWED DOWN AT ALL

392
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:56,649
THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS AND SO

393
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,484
WE COME TO WORK EVERY DAY WITH

394
00:11:58,484 --> 00:11:59,551
AN ATTITUDE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

395
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,886
FIND MOLLIE TODAY AND WE HOPE TO

396
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,988
BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND REPORT

397
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,356
THAT TO YOU SOON.

398
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,492
>> CAN YOU CONFIRM THERE WAS

399
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:06,759
FOUL PLAY?

400
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,794
>> I'M NOT GOING TO CONFIRM

401
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,163
ANYTHING AT THIS POINT RELATED

00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:13,766
TO THE RESULTS OF A LEAD OR TRY

403
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,635
TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WHAT

404
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:17,503
THE INVESTIGATION SHOWS AT THIS

405
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:17,736
TIME.

406
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,672
>> CAN YOU SAY HOW MANY TIPS

407
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:20,005
HAVE COME IN?

408
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:21,273
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER.

409
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:22,007
IT WOULD BE IN THE HUNDRED.

410
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,109
>> CAN YOU SAY HOW MANY STATE

411
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:24,743
POLICE OFFICERS ARE WORKING THE

412
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,144
CASE?

413
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,479
>> I WOULD SAY I BELIEVE WE

414
00:12:27,479 --> 00:12:28,714
REPORTED PREVIOUSLY, AND NOT

415
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:30,482
JUST STATE POLICE OFFICERS, BUT

416
00:12:30,482 --> 00:12:31,984

422
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:42,561
>> BRIEFLY EXPLAIN HOW RELEASING

423
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:43,796
THIS INFORMATION MAY COMPROMISE

424
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:44,429
YOUR INFORMATION.

425
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,497
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING IF

426
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:48,200
YOU GAVE US MORE, WE COULD HELP

427
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:48,366
YOU.

428
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,035
HOW COULD THAT POTENTIALLY BACK

429
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:50,235
FIRE?

430
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:53,272
>> IT IS PART OF OUR EVALUATION

431
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:53,839
PROCESS, WE CONSIDER THAT.

432
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,042
THERE ARE PARTS OF ANY

433
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,545
INVESTIGATION THAT WE HOLD VERY

434
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,281
CLOSELY FOR GOOD REASON, SO WE

435
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,749
ARE CONSTANTLY EVALUATING THAT

436
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:05,184
PROCESS AS WELL AS TO WHAT

437
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,418
INFORMATION WE SHOULD RELEASE

438
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,252
AND WHAT INFORMATION WE

439
00:13:07,252 --> 00:13:07,519
SHOULDN'T.

440
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,088
AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T BELIEVE

441
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:18,197
IT IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DO

442
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:18,363
SO.

443
00:13:18,363 --> 00:13:20,499
WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE RIGHT

444
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:20,766
APPROACH.

445
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,735
WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS

446
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:23,602
FRUSTRATING FOR EVERYONE

447
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:26,739
INVOLVED BUT WE BELIEVE IT GIVES

448
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:30,809
US THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO

449
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,410
RESOLVE THIS INVESTIGATION.

450
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:34,079
[ INAUDIBLE QUESTION ]

451
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,682
>> I'M SORRY, I COULDN'T HEAR

452
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:37,015
YOUR QUESTION.

453
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,685
>> CAN YOU SPEAK ON THE

454
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,721
IMPORTANCE OF THE PUBLIC GIVING

455
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:44,256
TIPS, WHATEVER TIPS THEY HAVE?

456
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,791
>> IT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

457
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:49,695
CONTINUES TO LET US GET TO KNOW

458
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:49,928
MOLLIE.

459
00:13:49,928 --> 00:13:52,565
PARTICULARLY PEOPLE WHO KNOW

460
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,300
MOLLIE OR WHO HAVE SEEN MOLLIE,

461
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,436
TALKED TO MOLLIE IN THE DAYS

462
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,904
LEADING UP TO HER DISAPPEARANCE.

463
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,072
OBVIOUSLY IF PEOPLE HAVE THAT

464
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,741
TYPE OF INFORMATION, THAT WE

465
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,010
HAVEN'T TALKED TO YET, WE WOULD

466
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,746
ENCOURAGE THEM TO CALL US.

467
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,481
YOU KNOW, AS THE SHERIFF SAID,

468
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,683
IF SOMEBODY THINKS THEY'VE SEEN

469
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,651
MOLLIE RIGHT AWAY, THEY NEED TO

470
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,853
CALL 911 OR CALL LOCAL LAW

471
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,155
ENFORCEMENT TO GENERATE AN

472
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,990
IMMEDIATE RESPONSE TO WHEREVER

473
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,292
THAT LOCATION IS THAT THE

474
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:20,692
SIGHTING OCCURRED.

475
00:14:20,692 --> 00:14:22,661
INFORMATION LIKE YOU'RE TALKING

476
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,829
ABOUT, PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE KNOWN

477
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,197
MOLLIE WHO WANT TO COME FORWARD

478
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,131
AND PROVIDE A PIECE OF

479
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,000
INFORMATION, THEY CAN USE THE

480
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,134
TIP LINE TO DO THAT.

481
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,669
IF THEY BELIEVE THEY KNOW THE

482
00:14:30,669 --> 00:14:32,137
IMMEDIATE WHEREABOUTS, THEY NEED

483
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,172
TO CALL 911 OR THE LOCAL LAW

484
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,874
ENFORCEMENT WHEREVER THEY MAY BE

485
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,309
IN THE COUNTRY.

486
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,746
>> CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT LAW

487
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,514
ENFORCEMENT SEARCHED A PIG FARM

488
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,516
RIGHT AROUND THE VICINITY OF

489
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,118
BROOKLYN, IOWA, AND IF YOU DID,

490
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:50,723
HAVE YOU HAD TO RETURN TO THE

491
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:50,990
PIG FARM?

492
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,225
MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS HAVE

493
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,061
YOU ASKED ANY OF THE SUSPECTS IF

494
00:14:56,061 --> 00:15:01,400
YOU CAN RESPOND, TO TAKE A

495
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:01,667
POLYGRAPH.

496
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:03,235
>> WE HAVE SEARCHED MANY AREAS

497
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:03,702
AROUND BROOKLYN, IOWA.

498
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:04,703
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS

499
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,505
OF THAT AND I'M NOT GOING TO

FOLLOWING UP ON LEADS.

507
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:22,320
THOSE LEADS ARE IN THE HUNDREDS.

508
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,455
OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE NOT ALL

509
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:25,657
INTERVIEWS, WE'VE CONDUCTED

510
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:28,226
NUMEROUS INTERVIEWS TO THIS

511
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:28,594
POINT.

PRESS CONFERENCE?

515
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:35,701
