a lot of news breaking and a lot of it is very good for the President of the United States so the best piece of news for the presidents of the United States is that he went to the tarmac to greet a bunch of North Korean prisoners who had been released as three North Korean prisoners rather than five three North Korean prisoners who had been released they're American citizens and here is what it looked like when the president of the United States greeted them on the tarmac at Joint Base and at the Joint Air Force Base in Andrews in the Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland okay so you can just see him greeting these guys they get off the plane and it is in fact a pretty amazing thing Trump went on he talked to the press he he did what Trump always does right and it's it's just the best of Trump right so Trump gets these guys out right mean these guys are released they come back Trump sets now that he's going to meet directly with Kim jong-un on June 12th so that is coming up in the very near future and we'll have to keep an eye on that obviously we don't know how those negotiations are going to go but all of these guys thanks president Trump for getting them out Trump then proceeded to go out there and brag about the ratings that he was getting at 2:00 a.m. and talk about how they'd been treated excellently by the North Koreans which of course is not really true but here's the thing I think the American public have learned to separate out the Trumpy from the good stuff that he's doing I think that the longer Trump's president C goes on the less people are worried as much about the kind of crazed nature of the Trump presidency and the more they're looking at the policy because right now the economy is doing very well instead of trading 5 terrorists for Bo Bergdahl a trader instead the President of the United States traded no terrorists for three Americans in North Korea
