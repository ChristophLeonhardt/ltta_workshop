>>THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS TO
THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT IN
THE WAKE OF THE LAS VEGAS
SHOOTING, THEY'VE BEEN TALKED
ABOUT ON THIS SHOW QUITE A BIT,
THERE'S ANOTHER ASPECT SOME
PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE THOUGHT
ABOUT WHICH IS FOR THE VICTIMS
OF THE SHOOTING WHO WERE TAKEN
TO HOSPITALS, HOW MUCH ARE THEY
IN FOR IN TERMS OF MEDICAL
EXPENSES WHEN ALL IS SAID AND
DONE?
THERE RECENTLY WAS A
REPORT PUT OUT BY THE
PEER-REVIEWED HEALTH AFFAIRS
JOURNAL AND IT FOUND --
>>JUST TO 
TELL YOU WHO THEY
WERE STUDYING IN THIS CASE.
AND
MARKET WATCH ADDS THAT THIS IS
LIKELY AN UNDERESTIMATED FIGURE.
AS IS MENTIONED BY THE WRITERS
OF THE STUDY THIS DOESN'T FOCUS
ON THINGS LIKE REHABILITATION
AND LOST INCOME WHILE YOU ARE
RECOVERING FROM YOUR INJURIES.
THAT NUMBER IS AROUND $100,000
FOR BEING THE VICTIM OF A
GUNSHOT AND GOING TO THE
HOSPITAL.
WHAT ARE YOUR
REACTIONS TO THAT NUMBER?
>>IT DOESN'T QUITE FIT WITH THE
ARGUMENT WE MAKE WHEN IT COMES
TO WALL STREET DOING THE SHADY
THINGS THEY DO.
BETTING AGAINST
US, SOME OF THE DAMAGING
BEHAVIOR TO OUR ECONOMY.
BUT
WHEN IT COMES TO WALL STREET WE
ALWAYS ARGUE THAT THEY PRIVATIZE
THE GAINS AND SOCIALIZE THE
LOSSES.
AND IN THIS CASE WE
AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE
GOVERNMENT FORCING AMERICANS TO
PAY ANYTHING, BUT WE ARE TALKING
ABOUT PRIVATE U.S. CITIZENS WHO
ARE VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE
HAVING TO PAY THE COST
ASSOCIATED WITH INSANELY LAX GUN
REGULATION.
AND THESE TYPES OF
MEDICAL BILLS DESTROY PEOPLE'S
LIVES, AND FAR TOO OFTEN WHEN WE
TALK ABOUT THE GUN DEBATE WE
FOCUS HEAVILY, AS WE SHOULD, ON
THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES, BUT
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE A
CONVERSATION ABOUT PEOPLE WHO
WERE SEVERELY INJURED AND WHO
DID HAVE THEIR LIVES CHANGED IN
AN INCREDIBLY DRASTIC WAY
BECAUSE OF GETTING VICTIMIZED BY
THIS.
>>IT'S SUCH A HEAVY DEBATE,
BECAUSE ONLY WHEN I TALK ABOUT
THINGS LIKE THIS DO I GET DEATH
THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, OR WHEN
I GET PEOPLE THAT GET VERY
VOLATILE, BUT PEOPLE THINK YOU
ARE TRYING TO TAKE THE GUNS
AWAY.
BUT THE REALITY IS
SOMEBODY PAYS THE PRICE
EVENTUALLY.
AND EVEN THAT
COUNTRY SINGER WHO ACTUALLY
STOOD UP AND SAID I WAS WRONG,
ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT GUNS, PEOPLE
AROUND ME HAD GUNS, AND NO ONE
COULD HELP, WAS JUST THE REALITY
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT
WILLING TO COME TO TERMS UNTIL
THEY ARE PERSONALLY AFFECTED BY
TRAGEDY.
BUT THAT'S A DOUBLE
TRAGEDY, TO BE IN RECOVERY AND
STILL HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING
IN DEBT.
AND THAT'S THE MEDICAL
PART, BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS A
MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT TO THIS,
TO SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO
NEED THERAPY FOR POSTTRAUMATIC
STRESS DISORDER, AND THAT IS
ALSO A TRAGEDY AND IT MAKES ME
SO SAD THAT PEOPLE GET SO
VOLATILE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
REGULATING GUNS, BUT IT TRICKLES
DOWN INTO PLACES YOU DON'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT.
AND NOW OVER 500
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THEIR FINANCES IN
ADDITION TO HEALING PHYSICALLY,
EMOTIONALLY, AND MENTALLY.
>>FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO MENTION
THAT COUNTRY SINGER WHO SAID I
WAS PERFORMING WHEN IT ALL WENT
DOWN -- THE STATEMENT HE MADE IS
A BRIEF STATEMENT AND ONE THAT
I'M GLAD HAPPENS AT ALL.
WHETHER
YOU DISAGREE OR AGREE, I'M GLAD
IT HAPPENS AT ALL, SOMEONE WHO
LOOKS AT THE FACTS, GOES THROUGH
AN EXPERIENCE, AND READJUSTS
THEIR POSITION.
WHAT I WILL SAY
IS THE WAY HE FRAMES IT, HIS
FIRST SENTENCE IS I WAS A FIERCE
PROPONENT OF THE SECOND
AMENDMENT UNTIL LAST NIGHT.
AND
WHAT IS SO -- ONE OF THE ASPECTS
THAT IS SO SAD FOR ME IS THE
EXTENT TO WHICH THE OTHER SIDE
HAS WON PART OF THE DEBATE BY
MAKING HIM FRAME IT THAT WAY.
LIKE, YOU ARE EITHER A PROPONENT
OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT OR YOU
ARE IN FAVOR OF GUN CONTROL.
AND
WHAT I WOULD SAY TO HIM AND
OTHERS LIKE HIM IS THAT THOSE
TWO THINGS AREN'T NECESSARILY AT
ODDS WITH EACH OTHER.
A LOT OF
RATES THAT WE HAVE ARE LIMITED
IN DECENT, SMART WAYS YOU WOULD
AGREE WITH.
AND I THINK THERE IS
COMMON SENSE GUN LEGISLATION
THAT STILL SAYS THAT AMERICANS
WILL BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY, WHO
ARE ABLE TO BE LICENSED AND
PASSED CERTAIN CHECKS, CAN STILL
HAVE A GUN.
OR IF THEY ARE A
VICTIM OR SUFFERING FROM A
MENTAL ILLNESS OR WHATNOT, WE
CAN STILL DEFEND THE SECOND
AMENDMENT AND RESTRICT WHO
WAS ABLE TO GET A GUN.
>>YOU ARE RIGHT, AND THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE FRAMED THIS ISSUE AS A
BLACK-AND-WHITE ISSUE ARE THE
WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS, THE GUN
MANUFACTURERS, AND THE NRA,
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT AN
INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION ON IT,
THEY WANT TO FRAME ANYONE WHO
WOULD DO ANYTHING, HAS ANY TYPE
OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD LIMIT
THE PROFITABILITY OF THESE
WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS, AS ANTI-
SECOND AMENDMENT INDIVIDUALS,
AND THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE.
NOW,
ARE THERE PEOPLE WHO ARE DON'T
EVEN WANT TO SAY RADICAL, BUT
PEOPLE ON THE EXTREME END OF THE
SPECTRUM WHO SAY WE SHOULD BAN
ALL GUNS?
YES, THOSE PEOPLE
EXIST.
IS THAT REPRESENTATIVE OF
EVERYONE TRYING TO HAVE A
LEGITIMATE CONVERSATION AND
DEBATE ABOUT GUN LEGISLATION?
ABSOLUTELY NOT. AND I'VE BEEN
OPEN ABOUT THAT, I'VE TALKED
ABOUT MY OWN DESIRE TO OWN A
WEAPON FOR SELF DEFENSE.
JUST
BECAUSE I THINK SOMEONE LIKE
PADDOCK SHOULDN'T HAVE HAD THE
ABILITY TO BUY A PRODUCT THAT
ESSENTIALLY TURNED HIS SUMMIT
AUTOMATIC WEAPON INTO AN
AUTOMATIC WEAPON DOESN'T MEAN
I'M AGAINST THE SECOND
AMENDMENT, IT MEANS I'M
CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN LIVES, I
WANT TO LIMIT AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE
WHO LOSE THEIR LIVES WHEN SOME
INSANE PERSON DECIDES THEY WANT
TO OPEN FIRE ON A GROUP OF
PEOPLE.
>>AND THAT STATEMENT IS YOU
AGREEING WITH SOMETHING THAT
MOST PEOPLE AGREE WITH.
IT'S
DIFFICULT IN NEVADA, I READ A
NEWSWEEK ARTICLE THAT REPORTED
THEY HAVE CERTAIN LAWS WHERE
THERE IS VERY LITTLE LIMITATION
ON WHAT YOU HAVE TO REGISTER
WHEN YOU PURCHASE A FIREARM AND
WHATNOT, SO IT'S DIFFICULT BUT
IT COMES DOWN TO A LOT OF
RESEARCH NEEDING TO BE DONE, AND
THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE
SYSTEM WE HAVE THAT DISSUADES
RESEARCH FROM BEING DONE, AND
THE PEOPLE WHO DID THE REPORT
EARLIER SAY --
>>AND THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON
HOW MUCH RESEARCH CAN BE DONE,
AND IT'S DUE TOO, I FORGET WHAT
THE NAME OF THE AMENDMENT WAS,
IT'S THE DICKEY AMENDMENT WHICH
WAS PUT ON THE OMNIBUS SPENDING
BILL BACK IN THE 90S, IT SAID
YOU CAN'T TAKE CDC MONEY, CENTER
FOR DISEASE CONTROL MONEY, WHICH
IS INVOLVED WITH ALLOCATING
FUNDS IN ORDER TO RESEARCH
PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS, AND IT
SAYS YOU CAN'T USE IT IN ORDER
TO DO RESEARCH THAT COULD
CONTRIBUTE IN SOME TANGENTIAL
WAY TO GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION.
>>THE GUN LOBBY DOESN'T WANT
THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE.
>>BUT IT'S SO DIFFICULT.
THERE'S
AN AMAZING VIDEO WHERE PRESIDENT
OBAMA --
HIS NAME 
IS ON THE OMNIBUS
BILL, AND IF
HE CAN CHANGE HIS MIND ON
THIS, THEN ANYONE CAN.
>>ANYONE CAN AS LONG AS THEY ARE
NOT INFLUENCED BY THAT MONEY
FROM THE NRA, FROM THE GUN
LOBBY.
IT'S A POWERFUL FORM OF
CONTROLLING LAWMAKERS, AND THAT
IS THE ONE AND ONLY REASON, THE
MAIN REASON, THE PRIMARY REASON
WHY OUR LAWMAKERS, SOME
DEMOCRATS INCLUDED, REFUSED TO
DO ANYTHING ABOUT GUN CONTROL.
>>AND IT'S SUCH AN EMOTIONAL
ARGUMENT, IT'S LIKE A MASS
HYSTERIA, BECAUSE THEY TIED IN
PATRIOTISM WITH OWNING A GUN. IS
A COMEDIAN WE WERE DIRECTLY
AFFECTED BY THAT NRA AD THAT WAS
VERY VOLATILE BECAUSE THEY
ACTUALLY MENTIONED COMEDY CLUBS.
THAT WE WERE LIKE THE ENEMY OF
THE NRA.
BECAUSE THE NRA CAME
FOR US, SO THE VOLATILITY IN
COMEDY CLUBS HAS INCREASED AND
NOW WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
SOMEONE IN THE AUDIENCE
POTENTIALLY HAVING A GUN THAT
DOESN'T LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO
SAY, AND CONSIDER WHAT WE SAY TO
BE UN-AMERICAN.
BECAUSE NOW
EVERYTHING IS EITHER PRO OR
ANTI-AMERICAN, IF YOU KNEEL YOUR
ANTI-AMERICAN, IF YOU SHOOT GUNS
YOU ARE PRO AMERICAN TO THIS
TYPE OF MENTALITY, BUT IT'S
SCARY FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY
EXERCISING OUR AMERICAN RIGHTS,
I HAVE PEOPLE PUT ON MY FACEBOOK
PAGE THAT THIS IS THE GREATEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD BECAUSE WE
CAN OWN GUNS IN CASE THE
MILITARY COMES TO GET US.
>>THIS IS NOT THE GREATEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, YOU HAVE
BEEN MISLED BY JINGOISTIC
PROPAGANDA.
IT'S NOT THE
GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
BECAUSE WE HAVE LAWMAKERS WHO
ARE COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE IN
LEADING, AND PROTECTING OUR
FELLOW AMERICANS, WE HAVE A
GOVERNMENT THAT'S DISGUSTINGLY
CORRUPT, WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT
THAT PURPOSELY PUTS OUR SOLDIERS
IN HARM'S WAY MERELY FOR THE
PROFIT OF WEAPONS MANUFACTURERS
AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS, THIS IS
NOT THE BEST COUNTRY IN THE
WORLD.
TAKE A LOOK AT OUR
STATISTICS IN EDUCATION,
HEALTHCARE, ALL OF THE
ESSENTIALS IN LIFE COMPARED TO
OTHER COUNTRIES.
WE ARE NOT THE
BEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, I
THINK THE IDEA OF AMERICA IS
INCREDIBLE BUT WE DON'T FOLLOW
THROUGH WITH THAT IDEA.
WE LIKE
TO SWING IT AROUND AND PRETEND
AS IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE VALUE
BUT WE JUST TALK ABOUT THE IDEA
OF AMERICA, WE DON'T PUT ACTION
BEHIND IT.
THAT MIGHT HAVE HURT
SOME PEOPLE'S FEELINGS BUT THAT
IS WHAT IS GOING ON.
>>I GET YOUR RHETORICAL STANCE
AND WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
IT, BUT YOUR DOG IS NOT THE BEST
DOG IN THE WORLD BUT YOU
STILL LOVE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE.
>>THAT'S A GREAT WAY OF PUTTING
IT.
>>BUT THE REALITY IS IF THE
MILITARY COMES FOR YOU, DO
YOU THINK YOU HAVE A SHOT?
>>BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S THIS
FANTASY.
>>THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
>>BECAUSE YOUR GUN SAFE IS IN
THE SAME ROOM WHERE YOU WATCH
300.
YOU ARE LIKE, YEAH, I COULD
TAKE DOWN PERSIA OR THE
EQUIVALENT.
>>REAL QUICK, GOING BACK TO THE
DEATH THREATS YOU ARE GETTING
FROM GUN ADVOCATES, I MEAN, IF
THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE
ARGUMENT THAT WE NEED LOOSER GUN
RESTRICTIONS AND THEN THEY
SIMULTANEOUSLY THREATEN YOUR
LIFE, I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
THEY ARE BEING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
A LITTLE BIT.
