I mean look I read today about a ten-year-old girl with Down syndrome who was taken from her mother and put in a cage I read about a did you say won't want to a ten-year-old with Down syndrome anything but the bottom line is very dear to you when you crash salutely dare you sir that is just one glaring example of what seems to be a recurring theme a certain lack of empathy by sub Trump supporters for the migrant families being torn apart at the border Cory Lewandowski Trump's one-time campaign manager refused to apologize for his remarks saying that he had nothing to do with the girl with Down syndrome meanwhile Melania Trump faced a huge backlash for wearing this jacket with the phrase I really don't care do you on the back while heading to visit migrant children on the texas-mexico border her spokeswoman said there was no hidden message but her husband quickly contradicted that tweeting that the message refers to the quote fake news media then there's this message from Fox News these are not like it or not these aren't our kids show them compassion but it's not like he's doing this to the people of Idaho or or or Texas these are people from another country and now people are saying that they're more important than people in our country who are paying taxes or web needs as well Wow joining me now Sophia Nelson a former GOP counsel on the House Oversight Committee an author of e pluribus one rediscovering our founders vision for a united America former State Department senior advisor nayara hawk and Republican strategist and friend of the show Caitlin Dawson thank you all for being here Sophia welcome to the show my friend let's go to you on this first I want to play a piece of Donald Trump's supporters at this rally that he held on Wednesday in Minnesota who were asked about Donald Trump's policy of separating families at the border take a listen if I tried to take my family to Canada illegally I'm not gonna be allowed to do anything if I take my family into Mexico illegally you might not ever see me again so I think it's a very just policy even though unfair for the family this whole thing of emotions versus logic oh my god want some money please care for the children well there's children if I get arrested my kids aren't going to see me for a while either don't bring them to the border you won't get separated from them that kind of callousness makes me cringe Sofia but I see it a lot I see to my social media feeds you hear it a lot it is not it is not like it is uncommon when you hear that what is it that you're hearing going on among some of these Trump supporters well first of all I think it's important to separate Trump supporters from Republicans and I think that's something we've been talking about right when you see Steve Schmidt when you see George Will calling for leaving the party or calling for the Democrats to take over you know that there's an epic crisis for the soul of the Republican Party but the Trump ofin of the Republican Party joy is what you're seeing this is a group of Americans that are terrified by the demographic shifts in our nation this is what the underbelly of all this is about it's a fear of immigrants it's a fear of people of color it's a fear of women it's a fear of what has never been and people that have voices now and so this callousness and this coldness that you see is also deeply rooted in who we are as a nation going back to 1619 when we brought slaves here for the first time in August of 16 1920 African slaves in Chains and then the process of separating a slave women from their children and ripping families apart is really a part of our history and we have to deal with that to come forward to understand the callousness that we're seeing right now but Sofia is that I don't know that you can separate the Trump base from the Republican base I mean you had Nixon with the silent majority you've had demonization of people of color whether it's on the issues of busing whether it's on issues of you know the Reagan era calling people welfare queens you know the tea party let let me play Amy Kremer because the dark were called the Tea Party with you know witch doctor mock-ups of President Obama that Trump came along and suddenly the Republican Party changed Trump tapped into something that was there and people like Steve Schmidt and George Will are the outliers it seems to me I want to play you Amy Kramer who was who came along through the tea party which predates Donald Trump being president this was heard this morning on CNN talk about the exact same issue every day in America children are separated from their parents because they commit crimes and the adults are incarcerated we enforce the law on American citizens why is it that we enforce the law upon American citizens but we should not enforce the laws upon people coming here illegally tell me the difference do they have more rights than we do Sophia that is not something that Donald Trump produced in the Republican Party that's in the Republican Party already joy you and I've been French for a long time you know me I've been a Republican a long time until I stopped being one in 2008 when I voted for Obama for the first time the issue is this is that there is a Nixon Southern Strategy as you mentioned I've been screaming for 25 years literally at the wind apparently to the Republicans that you're gonna have to change the way you talk about people of color deal with them deal with people who are different open up the tent for real and you have to have policies that back that up and messengers and people who can communicate with others other than somebody who is from the Caucasian southern Midwest base of the party and so when someone like that says what she says I don't have any words for that other than sheer ignorance but I do agree with you that the Republican Party has trended this way and Donald Trump just came in and blew it up and it's the Trump efficacious as I said of the GOP let me go to you Katyn just to build on what the field was just talking about the late Charles Krauthammer and God rest his soul and condolences to his family he passed away this week he had a column that he wrote in August of 2016 and he talked about Donald Trump in the fitness threshold he wrote Donald Trump the man who defied every political rule and prevailed to witness party's nomination last week took on perhaps the most sacred political rule of all never attack a gold star family not just because it a lien AIT's a vital constituency but because it reveals a shocking absence of elementary decency yet of natural empathy for the most profound of human sorrows parental grief Donald Trump then turned around in one the Republican primaries he won them before that he was already the nominee but he turned around and he a huge majority of among Republicans so this sort of callousness this sort of well they're not from Idaho which says something to me interestingly enough you know that's my toe so we don't care that's sort of coldness Donald didn't create he found it in the party right well he minded in the party you know we had 16 or so candidates and and presidential elections are not won on thousands of pages of white papers that we all get and read policies that run on big messages President Obama won on hope and change and and universal health care that's what he went on those were big messages Donald Trump tapped into the big message of illegal immigration that we we had seen in two prior elections and he tapped into that vein of saying that our borders are porous the Republican primary voters listen to it they're still listening to it they think the rule of law matters and this incident now just accentuates how poorly our laws are being upheld and and and it really accentuates what Donald Trump said during the election me I've always told you I'm not in love with the Republican Party I'm in love with America and I use the Republican Party as a vehicle to try to make it better you do Kate and I have to say you you do and you've gone through a lot of you did a lot of hard work to try to diversify their opposing party Sofia as well but the reality is though Katyn this isn't about the rule of law you know this anti-immigrant fervor that we're seeing not just among the Republican base but in Europe as well where there's just the sort of vehement stew it the sort of callousness to it this is ethnic this is about demographic panic this is not about the rule of law Donald Trump keeps claiming that either he can't change the law or only he can fix it it isn't a rule of law question isn't this a vein inside of your party that has a tissue rejection against a specific kind of immigrant I think it has a rejection to people who are breaking in our country illegally I do I see it at the rallies we see the events against the Irish who've overstayed their visas we've had you know groups come over from Ireland to see about something like 50,000 you don't see it Katyn I'm sorry you just don't you just they see the southern border they see the length of the southern border which is from Hilton Head South Carolina till the middle of Maine that's how big that border is and they see people coming over here breaking in our country that's what they see now you're right did they do they see the Irish do they see those probably not but they are accentuating seeing this problem from these other countries drug cartels and that is not a real crisis I mean Fox News is making it look like it's this you know hoard of brown people running over and committing crimes it didn't actually suggest leave it true I want to go to Mary before we go let's quickly play Laura Ingraham this is a Laura Ingraham who's a longtime talk radio a right-wing talk radio host who's now Fox News those these are talking monday about those migrant children separated from their moms and dads since more illegal immigrants are rushing the border more kids are being separated from their parents and temporarily housed and what are essentially summer camp camps okay these are not summer camps but now you know you've been on the radio all week on Sirius XM talking about this issue what are you hearing back what kind of calls are you taking I'm hearing a lot of emotion and I'm hearing the lack of emotion as well so I had a caller from Texas who served in Desert Storm who said his parents his father served in Germany he was the one who raised the Nazi references not myself and he was horrified he actually started to hear a grown man cry on the phone because suddenly he doesn't recognize his country is very difficult what's also difficult is hearing the opposite the people who say that who try to dismiss this it's the prevalence now of I call ostriches in America it's a bird that keeps its head in the sand and refuses to acknowledge the reality around them because they would rather believe they would rather believe that their government is doing good and that the person that they voted for has good intentions rather than recognizing that they have allied themselves with people who are willing to dehumanize and create an us-versus-them situation the same people who say us-versus-them about immigrants and people coming across the border others say people who do that about American citizens here in the United States yeah and I want to point out to our viewers those we have more time on that corey lewandowski who said the thing about womp-womp-womp about the pain of a disabled child being separated from their parents he's on a plane right now with donald trump corey lewandowski headed to Vegas with him so it's it's not as if this is there's anything considered wrong with doing that there is a there's something going on here I want to have you guys all back we'll talk about this again Sofia Nelson nayara hawk Kate Dawson thank you all have a wonderful weekend thank you
