the website Slade is hosting a panel next week on how the news media should cover Donald Trump slate named for the fact that their writers have the intelligence of a roof shingle has stalked the panel with journalists of diverse political positions ranging from the left to the left moderating the panel for instance will be CNN's fair-minded anchorman brian Stelter who has had the fair on his mind ever since he won a stuffed giraffe there by throwing baseballs at a milk bottle Stelter issued a statement saying quote in covering Donald Trump we want to make sure that we are as objective about this hate-filled racist scum ball as we were about the good and saintly president who preceded him who was also handsome to the point of being arousing and I'm totally straight I swear unquote Stelter went on to say while reporting on Trump at no time do we want our personal opinions to get in the way of our destroying him and salting the earth where once he trod sleights editor-in-chief Carlotta hysterics will also be on the panel and we'll discuss Trump's effects on women and allowed shrieky voice before swooning away miss hysterics told reporters quote during the campaign we went berserk every time Trump opened his mouth while covering up the failures and corruption of the Democrats and that didn't work so now what personally after going berserk in line I feel I've used up all the techniques I learned in journalism school and I'm looking for some fresh ideas unquote another panelist will be dusty remnant the fourth the chief editor of The New Yorker and author of the book if not Park Slope then where no really where remnant wrote a brief seventy three thousand word essay about the upcoming panel which said in part quote the whiplash like flabbergast Rijn of disorienting from our frabjous Obama Lissa miss to the suicidal fathom issue of Denali and melancholia his cormorants uka deal Borah canteen masataka hoopla I guess he got tired of looking upwards in the thesaurus about halfway through that the final panelist will be Univision anchorman or gate kill all Gringo's although to be fair I'm not sure whether that's his name or justice tattoo mister Gringo's told reporters quote Trump is different from other presidents because when we ruthlessly attack him ruthlessly attacks us back that's anti-american which I usually consider a good thing but not in this case after all there's a first amendment in our country well not in our country but in your country which would be our country if you hadn't stolen it new yong-ki dogs unquote among the topics the panel will discuss fake news and how to report it narrative and truth what's the diff and burn in hell Donald Trump will get you if it's the last thing we do actually that last one may just be a piece of graffiti on the wall of Slade's news room participating journalists say they look forward to holding the discussion and then vanishing into complete irrelevance trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show you
