1
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:14,010
People meet me and
they think, “Oh, my God.

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,420
Like, I — I had no idea.

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,390
I thought you were from
a different country.”

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,270
If it comes up, someone
asks, “Where are you from?”

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,190
And I say, “New York.”

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,360
They say, “No, no.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,363
"But where are
you really from?”

8
00:00:27,363 --> 00:00:30,330
I usually let them talk
and figure me out first.

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,890
And figure them out first.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,870
And also, I just think
it’s very awkward to be,

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,620
“Hi, my name is
Becca, I’m deaf.”

12
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:44,050
This is the cochlear implant
that I use to hear with.

13
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,500
It’s got a magnet.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,530
It’s got the part that
goes behind my ear.

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,270
And here’s the microphone.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,770
Here are the volumes.

17
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,520
The sound is transferred
through the wire

18
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,270
here and then into this coil.

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,150
And then it goes through
the skin on my head.

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,540
And then into the computer
chip that is inside my head.

21
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,940
And then through
the electrode array

22
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,190
that is wired
into the cochlear.

23
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,960
And then the sound, once it
gets through the cochlear,

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,920
it sends a signal
to the brain.

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,980
And then, I guess, to
the side is generally

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,460
what it looks like.

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,390
And here’s my right side.

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,490
And then, generally,
when I do my hairstyles,

29
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,950
I try to keep my coils,
my magnets hidden.

30
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,250
So, what you’ll find is
that when I take it off,

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,260
the longer I keep it off for,
the more my deaf disability

32
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,060
comes out.

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,710
My voice becomes
more monotone.

34
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,160
And it becomes more
difficult to think

35
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,230
about what I’m saying.

36
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,810
The only reason that
I know what I’m saying

37
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,260
is because I feel the
vibrations of my voice

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,170
speaking to the camera.

39
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,810
When I take my
cochlear implants off,

40
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,760
I cannot hear a single sound.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,310
Not even the loudest sound.

42
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,255
It’s a complete 100% silence.

43
00:02:05,255 --> 00:02:09,919
When I have it off,
I am a little insecure

44
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,800
about what I’m saying
and how I sound.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
Because I know it
sounds different.

46
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,510
And — but the second I put it on, 
I find that my voice

47
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,190
goes back to normal.

48
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,620
Hiding it means that we
can present ourselves

49
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,720
for ourselves,
rather than putting

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,110
our disability first.

51
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,830
But we aren’t hearing-impaired people.

52
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,260
We just have hearing loss.

53
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,665
Well, we’re deaf.

54
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:41,530
No.

55
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,055
We have hearing loss.

56
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:45,580
No, I really do —

57
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,220
I really do want to
say that I’m deaf

58
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,170
and that I’m not
hearing impaired.

59
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,330
Because I think
it gives people

60
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,800
a different perception.

61
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,250
And I want to give people a
different perception of what

62
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,440
being deaf really means.

63
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,260
When I first started,
it wasn’t the same.

64
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,360
I remember having a
box on my chest that

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,130
was under my shirt.

66
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,820
And each different device
and how much it changed.

67
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,260
Kids started
noticing that I had

68
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,520
something different about me.

69
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,780
I still had a body aid.

70
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:16,600
It was about this big
and it went directly

71
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,490
across my chest.

72
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,720
There was no way to
hide any of this.

73
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,450
So I had almost
like suspenders on me

74
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,390
with the giant ear molds
going into my ears.

75
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,190
I mean, there was
no way around it.

76
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,885
I was different.

77
00:03:28,885 --> 00:03:30,590
I don’t actually
remember doing this.

78
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,730
But apparently,
my mom told me I

79
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,790
used to act as
though it were a radio.

80
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,020
Even though there was
no music coming in.

81
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,760
So that was my first piece
of equipment in school.

82
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,580
I don’t remember it
ever being a problem,

83
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,930
other than I can’t be in
a water balloon fight,

84
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,840
was pretty much
the extent of it.

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,045
Which was disappointing,
but, you know, I managed.

86
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:58,770
When I was little, I hated
the hearing tests a lot.

87
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,990
I hated them because it was
having to sit in a room

88
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,370
and be forced to
acknowledge that there’s

89
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,410
something I’m not good at.

90
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,970
And that there’s something
that’s … harder for me.

91
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,325
And it sucks to spend an
hour or two hours, however

92
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,660
much time, to be,
over and over and over,

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,480
every beep, every word, reminded
that you’re not doing well.

94
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,340
I am not somebody
who fails tests.

95
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,590
Things got difficult for
me when I started to excel.

96
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,770
And the mainstream kids
who weren’t excelling

97
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,870
couldn’t understand why
they weren’t and I was.

98
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,790
And that’s when things
started to shift.

99
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,290
That yes, I’m different.

100
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,970
Yes, I have trouble hearing.

101
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,130
So therefore, I’m not
supposed to do as well.

102
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,910
I tried so hard to be,
quote, unquote, “normal.”

103
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,570
I just didn’t want people to
know I had a hearing loss.

104
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,920
It’s been something
I’ve dealt with pretty

105
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,690
much my whole life.

106
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,810
Trying to get people to not
know I have a hearing loss.

107
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,600
And I would say
only recently, maybe

108
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,330
within the last year
or two,

109
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,465
have I really come out
and owned it.

110
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:12,040
The difficulty,
the real difficulty,

111
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,630
was when I transitioned
into the clinical years

112
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,790
of my medical
school education.

113
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:21,850
Because they had never
had anybody with this type

114
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:24,340
of hearing loss.

115
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,162
And everybody was
just kind of —

116
00:05:27,162 --> 00:05:28,890
“Well, what do you
want us to do?”

117
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,500
Because I was so
high-functioning.

118
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,327
I am so high-functioning.

119
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,660
Most people look
at me and they

120
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,720
don’t see me as
needing anything extra,

121
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,780
see me as being any different.

122
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,589
So it was almost
harder for them

123
00:05:42,589 --> 00:05:44,630
to have to do a double
take and say, “Wait, what?

124
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,985
"You need help?

125
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:47,960
"You need something different?”

126
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,310
When it comes time to
being intimate with someone,

127
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,310
it becomes a big deal.

128
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,200
There are certain nuances.

129
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,540
There are certain
things that are said.

130
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,520
And there are
certain instances

131
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,560
where I would be
completely in the dark

132
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,560
and completely in the unknown
if I don’t have my hearing

133
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,250
aid on, if I don’t
have my implant on.

134
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:11,155
And it’s a very scary
feeling for someone.

135
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:12,700
So I’m engaged now.

136
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,980
I’ve been engaged for
maybe a month now.

137
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,910
And she’s a hearing person.

138
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,890
When we met, I didn’t tell her
upfront that I was hearing impaired.

139
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,940
She tried to call me,
and I would always

140
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,240
have some kind of excuse.

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,210
I would say I’m
in the bathroom,

142
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,960
or I’m at work, or something.

143
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,499
I’d make up an excuse.

144
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:33,040
When we were ready
to actually become

145
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,200
boyfriend and
girlfriend, that’s

146
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,070
when I actually told her
that I’m hearing impaired.

147
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,907
And she was like, “Wow, that
makes a lot of sense.”

148
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:42,640
Oftentimes, other
people are more

149
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,010
uncomfortable with my
hearing impairment than I am.

150
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,270
And I understand that.

151
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,139
People — we live in a
society in which, you know,

152
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,180
you don’t look at somebody
who’s in a wheelchair.

153
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,760
Just because you don’t want to
make them feel uncomfortable.

154
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,939
You don’t say anything,
you don’t ask questions.

155
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,980
There are people who don’t
want to talk about it.

156
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,320
And I think that we’re
so afraid of being

157
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,570
rude that sometimes I think we
make these people invisible.

158
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,600
And we create a barrier
between ourselves and them.

159
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,495
And I wish that more
people would just ask.

160
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,670
There was a definitely
a period of time

161
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,950
that I had trouble
finding a job.

162
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,111
I was really unhappy.

163
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:21,110
Every once in a while, I
would get the question,

164
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,926
“How are you on the phone?”

165
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,550
And then I — employers
are not supposed

166
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,390
to ask you specific
questions about how

167
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,650
you’re able to do something.

168
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,530
Because that’s
discrimination if they

169
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,540
choose not to hire you.

170
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,710
And I definitely got
that question, like,

171
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,020
hundreds of times.

172
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,080
But the risk is that
they don’t know —

173
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,580
I don’t know when
I don’t hear.

174
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,330
And I can’t always
tell them that.

175
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,490
And the risk is — is she
going to be able to keep up?

176
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,560
I didn’t have to use —

177
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,891
oh no, my battery is dying.

178
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,390
— Do you have another
spare battery?

179
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,306
Yeah, of course I do.

180
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:58,920
Yeah.

181
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,290
I have a spare battery …

182
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,304
I keep every day.

183
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:06,080
I always have a spare
battery pack in my wallet.

184
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:10,110
I have a cochlear
implant up here.

185
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,050
So now I can’t hear,
the battery is out.

186
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,332
That’s it.

187
00:08:33,332 --> 00:08:34,530
And we’re back.

188
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:37,198
I mean it’s …

189
00:08:37,206 --> 00:08:39,129
technology — you
know, your phone breaks,

190
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:41,740
my hearing aid breaks, my
cochlear implant is broken —

191
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,910
You adapt.

192
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,770
A couple of weeks ago,
my cochlear implant

193
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,940
actually broke.

194
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,060
And I had texted my mom
being like, “My unit broke.”

195
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,550
And my mom was
like, “Your A/C broke?”

196
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,810
And I’m like, “No, Mom.

197
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,750
"My implant broke.”

198
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,340
And she was like,
“Your dental implant?”

199
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,480
And I was like, “Mom!

200
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,230
"My hearing aid!

201
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,830
"My implant.

202
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,730
"My cochlear implant.”

203
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,021
And she was like,
“Oh, I forgot.

204
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:07,142
"Sorry.”

205
00:09:07,142 --> 00:09:08,725
People ask me
questions all the time,

206
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:10,090
like “Do you hear music?

207
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,370
"Do you hear sound?

208
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,120
"What do you hear?

209
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,770
"What does it sound like?”

210
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,690
I don’t think anybody
really understands

211
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,670
unless you live with it.

212
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,410
Because you can’t
replicate it.

213
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,480
You can’t … explain.

214
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,020
That first mapping
experience, it’s

215
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,100
a completely bewildering one.

216
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,910
The audiologist turned
it on, so to speak.

217
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,350
And I’m like, “I don’t —

218
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,000
"all I hear is
cracks and beeps.

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,590
"And this is not working.

220
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,800
"Hello?”

221
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
She’s like, “Wait a
minute, wait a minute.”

222
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,410
And even within the
span of 10 minutes,

223
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,780
something clicked into place.

224
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,780
It was surreal.

225
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,390
And I had that
weird sort of spasm

226
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,950
in my body when
they turned it on.

227
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,540
Because it’s just,
you know, life’s

228
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,740
being shot back into you.

229
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,920
I think getting my cochlear
implant was probably

230
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,705
one of the most emotionally
difficult times.

231
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,471
It was really hard.

232
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,210
I had just graduated
from college

233
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,080
and had just moved
back from L.A.

234
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
I needed to do something.

235
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,616
And my audiologist had made
a really good point for me.

236
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:43,760
She’d been trying to get
me to do it for years.

237
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,199
And she said to me —

238
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:46,740
a couple years before
that, she said,

239
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,600
“You’ll do it when
you feel like

240
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,980
"you’re missing something.

241
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,520
"When you feel like you’re
not getting everything

242
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,665
you should be getting
out of everything.”

243
00:10:57,665 --> 00:10:59,630
You just have to
learn to embrace it.

244
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,430
I mean, I think it
took me until college

245
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,100
to really embrace
how cool this is,

246
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,460
that I can hear, and
still take it off and

247
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,130
be deaf at the same time.

248
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,040
You know, it’s something
that I’m used to.

249
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,490
If I do reflect on it,
I never reflect on it

250
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,860
in a negative way.

251
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:27,630
It’s always, you know,
"Wow, look where I am."

252
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,950
You know, "Look
what I’ve overcome.

253
00:11:29,950 --> 00:00:00,000
"If I did this, anything
else is possible.”
