1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,216
“You’re so important to me.”

2
00:00:02,216 --> 00:00:03,578
“I love you so much!”

3
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:05,324
“I didn’t think I
could love someone

4
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:06,365
for the rest of my life.”

5
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:07,823
Can I tell you
something that makes

6
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:09,650
me a little bit of a monster?

7
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:12,650
I hate marriage
proposal videos.

8
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,020
I hate the proposal video
inspired by the Pixar movie

9
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,670
“Up.”

10
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,580
I hate the Bruno Mars “Marry
You” proposal flash mob.

11
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,840
I hate the one where she
takes the world’s largest zip

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,549
line into the proposal.

13
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:23,840
I hate the one
where she thinks

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,298
she’s going to go
on the “Today” show

15
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:26,720
to talk about her
nonprofit work,

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,750
but she’s really only
there to be proposed to.

17
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,330
I really hate the one
where the guy tricks her

18
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,420
into thinking their plane is
crashing and then proposes.

19
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,830
But the one where
the guy stages

20
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,284
a fake arrest of
his girlfriend

21
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:39,950
and the only way for
her to beat the rap

22
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,367
is to agree to marry him —

23
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,200
“Can I see the ring?

24
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,225
Just for evidence?”

25
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:44,946
I probably hate
that one the most.

26
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:46,400
“Will you please, please marry me?”

27
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:46,722
“Will you marry me?”

28
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:47,555
“Will you marry me?”

29
00:00:47,555 --> 00:00:50,630
I hate proposal videos because
they turn a private decision

30
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,740
between two people into
a big surprise that’s

31
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,570
sprung on just one of
them, usually a woman,

32
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,940
in a way that is so
dramatic in public

33
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,130
that it feels a
little bit coercive.

34
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,620
But the same thing that makes
these videos a little gross

35
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,154
is also what makes
them so popular.

36
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:07,131
“Yes!”

37
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:07,720
“Yes.”

38
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,219
“Yes.”

39
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:10,365
[cheering]

40
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:13,620
A part of me must love them
because every single one

41
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,190
of them, without
fail, makes me cry.

42
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,754
I hate that about them, too.

43
00:01:18,754 --> 00:01:20,670
“Some birthdays are more
special than others.”

44
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,925
[screams]

45
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:28,000
So much viral video is built
on these kinds of surprises.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,550
Proposal videos,
promposal videos,

47
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,700
college acceptance videos,
soldiers coming home videos,

48
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,705
soldiers coming home
to their dogs videos.

49
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:37,765
“Aw!”

50
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:40,930
Pregnancy announcement
videos, gender reveal videos.

51
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,050
This is the YouTubification
of dramatic irony.

52
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,750
Everyone watching knows
what’s going to happen.

53
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,970
The surprises aren’t
surprising to us.

54
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,190
We don’t watch a viral
college acceptance video

55
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,230
to see whether the kid
actually gets into college.

56
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,330
We know they do.

57
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,044
We want to see them know it.

58
00:01:58,044 --> 00:02:00,504
[screaming]

59
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,250
When we watch these
videos, we tend

60
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,920
to identify really strongly
with the person who’s

61
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,630
engineering the surprise.

62
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,490
Even if only for a
couple of moments,

63
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:13,570
we both know something
that somebody else doesn’t.

64
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,720
It makes us feel like a brave
soldier or a man in love.

65
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,730
It makes us feel important.

66
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,495
It makes us feel like Harvard.

67
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,176
[screaming]

68
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,610
It’s worth asking what this
emotional surprise porn has

69
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,560
in common with another
kind of surprise that

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,910
dominates online video —

71
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,205
[screaming]

72
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,120
The prank.

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,520
[shouts]

74
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,960
We inhale pranks of children,
and mothers, and perfectly

75
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,859
nice boyfriends —

76
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:44,775
“What’s on my neck?”

77
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:45,816
“It looks like a hickey.”

78
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:47,325
And really good dogs.

79
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,230
We prank dogs now.

80
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,210
Cats, too.

81
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,900
There’s a dark side to our
obsession with these videos.

82
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,062
Viral proposal videos often
work by scaring the target —

83
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:00,915
“Oh, my god!”

84
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:05,380
Before showering her
with everlasting love.

85
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,040
It creates the greatest
possible emotional whiplash

86
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,216
for the camera.

87
00:03:09,216 --> 00:03:10,420
“No way!”

88
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,720
And it gives us this
powerful feeling of control.

89
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,740
People in the videos aren’t
the only ones affected.

90
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,860
Lisa Silvestri, who studies
digital culture in war,

91
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,020
suggests that surprise
homecoming videos

92
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,480
produce a feeling of
vicarious sacrifice.

93
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,900
When we watch them
and cry, she says,

94
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,140
we feel as if we’ve sacrificed
something, too, even if it’s

95
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,640
just our own complacency.

96
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,180
Which means we might
feel incredibly strong

97
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,360
positive vibes around issues
that we don’t necessarily

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,710
agree with.

99
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,240
A soldier’s
homecoming inspires

100
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,075
really warm and patriotic
feelings about the place

101
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:46,350
he’s coming home from —

102
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,750
the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq.

103
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,780
A college acceptance video
reinforces the vaguely

104
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,120
dystopian idea that
higher education is

105
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,320
a once-in-a-lifetime
privilege, not a right.

106
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,730
And a surprise
proposal video suggests

107
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,280
that the most important
moment of a woman’s life

108
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,410
is when a man chooses
her for marriage.

109
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,350
Maybe you already agree
with all of those things,

110
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,490
or maybe you don’t, but you
just want to feel something,

111
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,250
and that’s O.K., too.

112
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,952
You can keep your
surprise videos.

113
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:19,910
“I think she’s saying I
can’t do it right now.”

114
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:21,829
And I’ll keep mine.

115
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,295
“Hey, I’m Amanda.”

116
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:29,870
“I’m Shane.

117
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,959
“He edits the videos.”

118
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,875
“She writes the videos.”

119
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,990
"You watch the videos.”

120
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,135
“And if you like the videos,
like, comment and subscribe here.”

121
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:39,535
“And then tell us, what do you hate 
that everyone else seems to love.”

122
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:41,215
“Leave your answer in the comments.”

123
00:04:41,215 --> 00:00:00,000
“We are very thirsty.”
