00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
hi friends so I spent this last week in

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,160
New York a trip from which I have no

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,919
footage at all right I spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,780
time working which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful it felt</font>

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,240
wonderful to be working and swiftly

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,950
abbreviating the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of foods which I</font>

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,450
have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it was good to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be around</font>

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,119
people it was good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> writing and</font>

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,820
eating and talking and moving however

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:23,519
loosely through the mythologized shuffle

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,529
of the city but my last<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in town I</font>

12
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:27,420
spent entirely alone walking through

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,099
parks and bookstores and eventually

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,320
finding myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the American Museum of</font>

15
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,809
Natural History it's a beautiful museum

16
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,880
and huge it's laid out like a labyrinth

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,170
where you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to weave through</font>

18
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,750
mountain goat diorama after<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nepalese</font>

19
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,280
artifact to get to where you're going

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in the corner of a corner of a</font>

21
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,840
corner that I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 25 past oceans and</font>

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,090
meteors and the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> of human evolution</font>

23
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,789
to get to I ended up in the Hall of

24
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,730
minerals perhaps not the most popular

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">exhibit it's a room full of rocks albeit</font>

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,829
a room full of rocks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a very</font>

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,199
pretty Instagram and it had the least

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,589
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of life of any room in the</font>

29
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole museum sort of there are a lot of</font>

30
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,479
ways that minerals can form but most

31
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,729
often it starts somewhere deep within

32
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:14,010
the Earth's crust high temperatures and

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">tons of pressure can liquefy the</font>

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,320
minerals that exist there mixing and

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,600
concentrating and cooling into new

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,970
crystal structures we can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sum up here</font>

37
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,130
of course but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're there minerals</font>

38
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,180
that look like something out of science

39
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,759
fiction landscapes just quietly building

40
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,340
into shapes that look like bubbling

41
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,009
stretching stacking slicing there's

42
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,740
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a something considerable depth</font>

43
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,530
below whatever ways on it struggling

44
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,530
against pressure moving in<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,570
little ways it can move growing into

46
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,210
something may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

47
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">beautiful or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe both and I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,200
see it sometimes I

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,329
no more emotion than a stack of rocks

50
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:59,530
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> too I'm quietly growing so in</font>

51
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,530

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,840
