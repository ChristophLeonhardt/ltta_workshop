in the wake of their failure to stop the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court the George Soros funded Council of unhinged leftist knuckleheads or cuck gathered last night to discuss whether they should come up with some new tactics cuck President dieter fascists addressed the gathering saying quote I sometimes wonder if we should stop bullying people by surrounding them with angry mobs shrieking nonsensical slogans but if we abandon that technique we'd have to support our ideas with logical arguments in son never mind unquote feminist leader shrilly harridan did a post-mortem on the failed anti Kavanagh protest saying quote speaking is a totally irrational woman I thought we could appeal to that feminine energy that disregards facts in favor of hysteria and self-righteous entitlement and thereby bring all feminist women together into one huge screaming 50-foot shrew raging completely out of control when that tactic failed we were left with a bunch of girls acting like lunatics and hoping someone would do whatever we wanted just to get us to shut up that always worked with Daddy but somehow it didn't do the trick this time unquote other council members suggested changing some of their slogans and chance to make them more realistic for instance the chant the people United will never be defeated might be rewritten to say a small number of excitable adolescents shouting triumphant sounding hogwash really has no effect on anything during the Q&A period one visitor to the cut conference suggested quote maybe it's just too arrogant and dishonest to claim were speaking for large identity groups that we essentially invented for our own purposes maybe women minorities and homosexuals are really large collections of individuals with differing interests and opinions who can't always be formed into a useful mob willing to mindlessly do our bidding in the name of a grievance panic that we created in the first place unquote the leftist council took the suggestion under advisement then beat the visitor to death while chanting slogans and shrieking trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show all right

it's a civil war now things that you now the blue wave the red wave that this and that see I have this saying that I don't know if you know Damon Runyon he wrote these wonderful stories about mobsters they they made them into the musical Guys and Dolls Damon Runyon didn't say this but he couldn't I always say the future is what happened if the future is what hasn't happened yet that we don't know what it is I think that's we don't know any of this stuff what we do know what we do know is that this is a tremendous victory and if you can't pause for a minute and take a breath and say wow great country this America you can win these victories still against the mob if you can't do that what are you fighting for if you're not going to enjoy the moments of victory what are you fighting for we are fighting to preserve this country and more important than Cavanagh and more important than anything about you know everybody says this is all about abortion it's not all about abortion abortion is about the Constitution abortion is about the Constitution it's not about the outcomes of that happened in the Supreme Court it is about who is to rule us I say us and our representatives the Left says five people in the Supreme Court can just make a ruling and rewrite the Constitution like that and it's about the rule of law law and due process triumphing over the mob it really is they really did take the very legitimate complaints of the me2 movement they're very legitimate complaints about women and how they are treated in workplaces where there are powerful men without conscience 'as they took those legitimate complaints and they weaponize them to take people's freedom they weaponize the pain to turn it into hysteria to take people's freedom and it's done on purpose and it's done by our old friend George Soros you know they're a woman astra q Nnamani a former Wall Street Journal reporter who is a leftist feminist pro-abortion person who used to be a reporter for The Wall Street Journal shoot she has been following the resistance money why because she's also a reporter you don't find those too much anymore but she is a reporter and she's been following the money and she's organized her findings into a spreadsheet which you can get online at least 50 of the largest organizations that participated as partners in the woman's March received from mr. Soros is open society foundation he's the guy who does not believe Americans should have its own sovereignty he believes that we are the biggest stumbling block to a better world he has said that he has a a Messiah Complex he has said he thinks he's a god and all of this money the number of Soros backed partners has grown to at least a be at least 20 of the largest groups that led the Saturday anti Cavanagh protests had been open society grantees why don't they cover it this is the best part she says I've pieced this together it's an open secret but one that journalists avoid why she says many sympathize with the liberal causes open so it's society champions and some have been paid open society fellows or grantees and this is what the open society turns you into show that protest where they were beating on the door of the Supreme Court here they are beating these people went and after the confirmation vote they started attacking the door of the Supreme Court it looks like a scene out of Night of the Living Dead it's Night of the Living left or Night of the Living brain-dead or something you know it's like they just look like zombies they turn people into and that's what made this is why and let me just point out one thing when we're talking about due process and they say well you know there's a Daily Caller had a thing where they went out and interviewed some of these protesters about whether they should get due process play that for a minute but not in this case not in this case bike innocent until proven guilty apply here I want to believe it but his behavior is trying to contrary to that I feel like it would have been proven guilty does that apply to people involved why isn't she extent the same right artisan in courtesy do you think the Kavanagh deserves you processed or is this different you know it's frightening right it's frightening they're getting rid of due process and the presumption of innocence and one of the arguments as well it's not a court of law it's a job interview let me tell a Hollywood story all right in Hollywood Mira Sorvino a terrific beautiful actress one that I think she has an Oscar and a Golden Globe she got chased around the room by Harvey Weinstein so what did Harvey Weinstein to do when Peter Jackson was trying to cast Lord of the Rings a very big movie write a very important part for an actress to get he was looking at Mira Sorvino he was looking at Ashley Judd who also got chased around the room by Harvey Weinstein Weinstein's people call up Jackson say oh you know these actresses are really really tough to work with they are terrible terrible people so he didn't hire them he didn't hire them didn't they deserve the presumption of innocence he was it's on not blaming Jackson he got conned and he really regretted it he was really sorry about it but didn't they deserve the presumption of innocence even in a job interview why because anybody can say anything about anyone your ex-husband your ex-wife can show up it's just slander you in any situation ruin your life you've always that he accused the accused not the accuser gets the presumption of innocence and you do not want and that's why this is such a victory this is why you have to pause for a minute and say whoa what a great country what a country and that and the people were genuinely heroic and that's the thing I want to talk about in just a second but first I have to talk about my underwear because you know there's nothing more important than my underwear because these pair of thieves this is true para thieves makes us underwear that is incredibly comfortable it is like you were going commando you wear it you do not know you are wearing it it's the most comfortable underwear you can wear it's got this moisture wicking fabric they want me to talk about who cares I don't have to make it I just have to wear it and it feels so good it giv makes you feel cool and fresh it's like air conditioning in your pants one of the guys who started pair of thieves says all his wife ever wants to see him is a pair of they're super fit briefs and his wife is Jessica Alba no this does not mean you should take pictures of yourself and your pair of thieves underwear and send them to Jessica Alba but you can show them to your wife for a limited time this month only our listeners get 20% off their first order at pair of thieves comm slash clayvin 20% off when you go to pair of thieves comm slash Clavin is this month only and I'm really not joking around I mean I actually didn't know I was doing their ad today and I put them on because they're just so comfortable pair of thieves dot-com slash Clavin and you will just say ah how do you spell Clavin it's Kate L so this this what these people were genuinely heroes and a lot of times we think a hero looks like this basically but it turns out a hero really looks like this got six nothing is irreparably damaged this has been a nasty process initiated in the beginning by Senate Judiciary Democrats and then carried over into the public we've literally been under assault here by a mob that to go into our homes brushing up against this in the halls requiring enhanced security but look the good news is the mob didn't win justice will be done we protected the presumption of innocence in this country it applies in all walks of life and certainly in Supreme Court confirmations cocaine mention that during after the first after Christine Blasi for testified he called up Trump and said you know that it's only halftime you know we got a stick to stay the course and everything he was very strong about it and he's told them I'm stronger than fools piss on this man I figured well you know lay off the coke mention it but no really really who would think that this guy with this very narrow emotional range as you would say who looks like that he's the hero and we've picked on him a lot of people I I haven't because I always understood this but like a lot of people on the right have picked on him because when you're in it a organisation like that and you're wrangling 50 senators all of whom have enormous egos all of whom are excellent politicians or they wouldn't be you know the US senators you know it's it's hard to get everything done but he has committed himself to these judges you've got 26 Circuit Federal Court judges he has done a tremendous job I have to give a little bit of a nod to flake you know I really picked on flake when he caved in after the Soros women went after him in the elevator but you know he stuck to his guns he did the right thing he said he was I want to hear the FBI report and that did actually convince a lot of people one of whom was another of the heroes here with Susan Collins and all we've heard about is oh women you have to listen to women you have to believe women but they don't that's not what they're saying what they're saying is you have to listen to leftists and if the leftists are women great and if they're not women we're gonna take him down and Susan Collins just spoke so clearly about why she was voting for before Kavanagh that it really was like mommy came home I don't think Collins actually has any children but it was like mommy came home and found that children had gone insane and were punching each other and it was like everybody go to their room and think about due process I mean speech was like Elizabeth this debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial but certain fundamental legal principles about due process the presumption of innocence and fairness do bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them it really was like mommy game home you know like boys gang you know you got to have some due process presumption of innocence Cavanaugh was a hero Cavanaugh himself was a hero because he stood up for himself and that moment that they tried to they try to weaponize his his anger and his hurt against him he was advised before he go going in brian mccann I think his name is he's the guy who organizes Trump's judge picks and has done such a great job he said some show him how you feel show him how you feel and he went in and he showed him he was angry he was hurt he was upset he had been slandered he had been viciously treated and that puts some spine into the Republicans that was a heroic thing to do and one thing we should take away from that especially the boys here is like stand up for yourself don't let him tell you oh just just stay down keep your head down don't let him attack you don't you know you know people have paid a lot more a lot higher prices for freedom than just being attacked on Twitter you know and then just being attacked by your friends by just you know getting bad grades in school from an unkind and dishonest left this professor people have paid higher prices not Cavanagh did the right thing that was heroic and another guy who I have to tell you it's really hard for me to call this guy a hero for a lot of reasons and I'll tell you some of them but Trump was a hero Donald Trump you know when you charged over a hill you know and you're running into gunfire you don't know who the guy next he is the guy next to you may be a bad guy he may cheat on his wife he may embezzle money but in that moment he may be doing the heroic thing and Donald Trump I'm not sure how many Republican presidents would have stood by this guy in the hour of need now I'm sure that McConnell stiffened the spine when it was needed but still we know Trump is a fighter we know he is a belligerent we know he will not back down and he didn't back down it would have been a lot easier for him a lot of people were saying it would have been a lot easier for him to say all right you don't like this can't you no candidate but the principle matter the principle was everything more important than Cavanaugh himself is the principle let's listen to Trump selling it to an arsonist and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob and that's what they become the Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern Republicans believe in the rule of law not the rule of the mob good for president the Donald is time to just stop for a minute and remember this is still a country with heroes in it this is still a country with principles is still a country that stands fast even in the face of the mob it's a beautiful beautiful thing tomorrow the battle starts again now the battle starts again the election is coming but for a moment you've got to take a breath and remember this is a beautiful thing have we got Janna bring on the wonderful Jenna Ellis I'm telling you I didn't get your rent check Johnny you're supposed to be paying rent on the studio at this point but I can't even gotten my tiara yet so I think we're fair well I caved into the Twitter mob demanding that you come back but I'm always so happy to see you director of the Dobson Policy Center a constitutional lawyer her book is the legal basis for a moral Constitution you look like you're in Washington DC don't tell me are you invited to the confirmation I am and it's very exciting I'm here at the Trump International Hotel right now so that's very exciting and dr. Dobson and I will be attending the swearing-in event at the White House tonight which is a great honor that is great while you were there for us all you are representing all of us and I'm so that's really terrific I'm glad to hear it so what what does this mean and from a legal standpoint I mean this is the stuff that we don't have the expertise to know he's you know about Cavanaugh's decisions you know these cases he's going to be facing right away some of them because the courts in session what do you think is the immediate effects that we'll see well the immediate effect I mean nobody is sitting here talking about oh my gosh product liability is just gonna totally change you know I mean we're talking about a conservative majority mainly for the issues that the left has been using to manipulate an activist court for the last 50 and 60 years and so in the initial term here I think what's going to be interesting is to see what cases they actually vote to bring on the docket because only four justices need to vote affirm to grant what's called the writ of cert or the cert petition to get a case on the docket and so justice Cavanaugh now will represent I think an important fourth vote to get cases that may otherwise have not been heard like the masterpiece cake shop case from last year that's stood pending for several years before they got to four votes to actually hear that so I think we're going to be seeing more religious liberty issues more freedom of speech issues I'm more First Amendment cases generally and things that a conservative court will now hopefully try to continue to preserve and protect our fundamental freedoms through cases that they add on to the docket so that that's really interesting was it Kennedy you feel who has not let that fourth vote when those cases in cases like cake shop were coming up yeah you know Justice Kennedy had a very interesting dynamic on the court he was known as the swing vote or the most powerful man in Washington because of that and he did I definitely believe in our fundamental protections but where he was a very weak and non conservative was on the social issue agendas and so of course he wrote the Virgen fell vs. Hodges a majority opinion the same-sex marriage opinion and that that case frankly read like a Hallmark card I mean it was something that I was not legally robust it absolutely went against the constitutional framework and that was all four of the dissents in that case were very clear that this was potentially a win for the LGBT agenda but it was not a win for the Constitution and so where justice Brett Kavanaugh I think will step in and be different than Anthony Kennedy is looking at protecting and preserving the Constitution he has had a very very clear track record and even conservatives initially wanted a me koni Barrett some of them did but but for Cavanaugh specifically I think that the reason that both sides were a little bit hesitant in the beginning is because he's not an outcome-based jurist and as a constitutional law attorney I think that's actually the most appropriate justice that we can have on the court that's that's really interesting I mean Susan Collins spoke at length by the way I have to just mention that the dissent Antonin Scalia's dissent in Oberkfell is one of the great pieces of writing I just I think everybody read that susan collins was talking about this that he is in fact he is bound to precedent he does respect the precedent that and may that may keep something like roe v wade in place after so many years was it like forty five years do you agree with that I think that if if Brett Kavanaugh is looking at the Constitution then he will apply the original instruction and that means there is no right to abortion in the Constitution we've talked about this before in the sense that if if they are actually faithfully applying what the legislature can can actually legislate pursuant to article one of the Constitution that is not a right to privacy that covers abortions in those circumstances and so if they were to overturn it I think it will be by degree and it will then the easiest way to do that is from a Federalists perspective to say this is really a state issue turn that back to the states and what's fascinating about that is even the Murphy versus n-c-double-a case that even Justice Kennedy last term voted it was a 5-4 decision on this on the state gambling statutes that was a federalist decision where five justices who were acting as originalist said this isn't something that we as the federal government can regulate this has to go back down to the state and if we're not looking at this from a politically biased perspective that's really where it should go and I think that the Supreme Court with a justice Brett Kavanaugh we will see that within the next couple of years and this is why the left is so angry and why they're putting up from the women's March today on their Twitter a banner of Susan Collins saying she is a rape apologist it's absolutely ridiculous because they're saying women we only support the women who we agree with and their their agenda is completely pro-abortion it's not about the Constitution it's not protecting Liberty or like hey you know that that rape apologist sign is another Soros funded effort that was put out there by one of his one of his organizations my last question is the position of John Roberts a lot of conservatives ben shapiro among them are very disappointed with roberts i feel a little bit more i approve of him a little bit more what position do you think this is going to put Roberts now become Kennedy does he become the swing vote on the court he's probably the one that on some of these issues like we saw you know we were all disappointed in him for the Obamacare decision for some of those issues he tends to be a little bit more of a broader government intervention so I think that the cases that we need to look at our immigration issues and especially the administrative state so when we're looking at something like Chevron deference which is of course the legal term for saying what does the federal judicial branch have to adhere to when an administrative agency is looking at interpreting and applying a congressional statute how much deference do we give them to interpretate their interpret their own mandate and I think those cases in particular will be very interesting for Roberts but um he has a lot of colleagues now who hopefully now that Justice Kennedy has has stepped aside and resigned hopefully he will find himself among a conservative majority that will encourage him to do the right thing and again faithfully apply the Constitution this is an outcome basis isn't just saying that okay now conservatives if you identify with a certain group now we're pushing our agenda conservatism is about conserving the rule of law having liberty and justice for all that's what our Constitution provides but within those limited margins of government so I think this is a great day for America amen amen thanks very much John it's always great to see you and I'm really excited you're gonna be at the confirmation we'll be thinking about you I'll send you pictures thanks so much for having me out okay time alright finally finally the belly fire has launched the next

locket still in my hand I rolled off the bed there was nothing to pack I had nothing with me I ditched my phone so no one could trace me I'd stopped at an ATM near La to stock up on cash I couldn't use credit cards they could trace those to I dismantled the GPS in my car no internet no social media I was invisible and I was utterly alone I crossed the Pitt brown carpet to the door I opened the door onto the night outside there was billiard ball he stood gigantically on the threshold framed in the doorway with the parking lot lights glaring behind him before I could react he jabbed me in the neck with a stun gun the electric blast sent me reeling back into the room convulsing down to the floor I dropped to the carpet jerking and shuddering my muscles were locked up in mobile all I could do was lie there and judder and watch as billiard balls stepped calmly into the room and calmly shut the door behind him his enormous shoulders were packed into a leather jacket his muscles bulged through the thin sweater he wore underneath he looked down at my quivering body without a smile without a sneer without any emotion at all he hardly seemed interested in what he saw he reached into his jacket and slid the little stun gun into his left inside pocket then he reached across into his right inside pocket and drew out a small leather case terror exploded inside me as I watched him unzip the case and deftly remove a syringe I made a horrible helpless gurgling noise in my throat as I battled to get control of my body it was no use my muscles had been severed from my will man that

e there there he is I am so excited for this it's funny when you're when you're working on a bunch of things I mean we started another Kingdom a year ago no or a year a year and a half ago maybe and you kind of forget when they're gonna come out and then I just wake up this morning and I see that it's out there on the website I'm so excited for it and the story is so good you know there's I kind of screw up the performance at times you have to go back and do another take because I'm surprised by what happens in the story you know I know I let go you know I don't want to give anything away but there was a story that some of the stuff that is made up that I was just making up in this it is in the newspaper I mean like I'm looking out there oh my god I made that stuff and it reminds me of what I wrote a novel a long time ago with a prison break in it and I called up the security guys at one of those toughest prisons and I described the prison break and he said that would work I opened the newspaper today I thought wait that's my story it is that's where I don't want to give anything away it is reading what's happening especially in the press right now yep with everything that's happening in politics you know it has been happening for a while it is off the pages of another Kingdom there's a third Kingdom now you know there's the a of the story this crazy fantasy land and then there's reality which is the craziest of all well you know I've been I've been waiting to have you on not just to talk about this but also to wish you a happy Columbus hectares your favorite oh it is my favorite holiday to quote Tony Soprano Christopher Columbus was a brave Italian explorer and in this house he's a hero and a story and I saw you on Twitter somebody was complaining how could you how can you make a hero out of Christopher Columbus when he destroyed what was it the Aztecs oh yo all the indigenous people you know he arrived at the the Taino peoples he then he went to San Salvador II went to the Isla de Caribe where all of the the cannibals were eating friars and things like that and and then you know he because of him the Europeans came they established civilization in the Americas and they wiped out the indigenous peoples what they forget though they sometimes miss this point is they say Christopher Columbus brought rape genocide and terror into this utopia of the New World five years before Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas the Aztec empire slaughtered 84,000 people over the course of four days to concentrate the temple of Tenochtitlan he was a great God though technically you're gonna kill 80,000 people it should be for that guy well they seemed to I think they get the math a little wrong though because if Christopher Columbus brought over the slaughter and the genocide and the rape he must have done it by a teleportation five years before he actually arrived in the Americas you know it is a good point to I'm you know I I'm willing to grant that there were Indian tribes in America who were mistreated and yet Singapore cheated of course that is all true but it is true that as a as a human being right the world that came to America this continent at that point is a less less violent world a less oppressive world and less you know and of course we're women it's the only world to be in right and you know this is really what bothers me about so all of this slander and smears against Columbus they're all based on nothing there's now in recent years it's they've taken to using a couple documents about it what a bad guy Columbus was to smear him they're relying on one document that was written by Francisco de beau who was Columbus's chief political rival in the new world it'd be like I don't know referring to Hillary Clinton's book to get an idea about who Donald Trump is and so that that is a little frustrating but it's the ingratitude that's so frustrating because you're living in this world you're living in the nearest to heaven on earth which is the Americas the United States in particular this country has given to the world more in charity more in protection more in Liberty than any other civil power in history and the self-flagellating Americans of today particularly white liberals think that it would be better had none of that ever happened they'd say oh how awful it is that we're living here oh hold on one second I need to tweet on my iPhone the corporations are I got a tweet Google's riotous i steven pinker has a great line in his book enlightenment now-ish is a problematic book for me but still it's a it's a very entertaining and knowledgeable book it's full of interesting things but you got a great line where he says progress erases its own footprints and this the fact that we live in this world I mean sometimes you know we go over to Jay Hayes house and I sit on his balcony and I look down and a Trader Joe's and for people who don't know this is fantastic upscale you know supermarket basically I think yes you could drive down to Trader Joe's and spend you know a tiny fraction of the money night and get some of the best food ever Pharaoh of Egypt would give up his pyramids to have up trader you know I really would it's an amazing world and we really don't know it speaking though we was saying that this is like the the only place to be is the only civilization that has ever treated women with the decency and kindness and freedom that this civilization does the way they are you know they all we hear about is how evil we are the right is toward women now sexist were terribly sexist on I've been watching the way they treated Melania Trump especially over the in this Africa trip when she's been so charming and and beautiful and delight she's being treated like garbage by the left well you know we need to believe all women we need to support all women we need to raise up all women unless they work for Donald Trump do not Trump or have ever even looked at Donald Trump and then we have to destroy them and smear them the treatment of Melania is a scandal and history will not look well upon the media and the Democrats who have abetted it you know during the Obama administration Michelle Obama appeared on 12 magazine covers she graced a dozen magazine covers Melania Trump who has been a professional model since she was about 16 I believe she's been on one magazine cover she was on Vanity Fair in 2017 and right at the inauguration and there was this big hullabaloo about it and so they refused to have her on these these magazine covers Michelle was out and she was on Vogue three times essence twice Time magazine twice no Melania and and now by the way with this Kenya trip you've got the entire mainstream media apparatus going after her so the the main attack on her is that when she was on safari in Kenya she dressed as is appropriate when you're on safari that's the big attack they were picking on her fur hop that's what I say that so she so she weren't that the pet specifically the pith helmet you know which is this when you think of traveling around Africa that's what you think of and so CNN tweet they send out this headline says quote US First Lady Melania Trump's latest white hat evokes colonialist comparison yeah yeah exactly yeah you always love I always love when they leave out the object of it yeah critics say no you're the critic they write about this the pith helmet Melania Trump wore during a Kenyan safari wasn't her most glaring faux pas Oh first of all what can you name one faux bothers I can't but some see her choice of a symbol of European colonial rule as a big error on the global stage some see okay some of course being the New York Times and it's not a symbol of colonial rule the pith helmet that that very specific white hat is still a part of the official uniform of the Kenyan government of the public administration officers have you remember when I was there that the cops were don't they that's right yeah they wear this hat and I'll tell you something they're not white people but this is a symbol of colonial it's so outrageous so they just make it up whole cloth and then they attack her for it and they say some say and critics say and and they they alternately attack her for being you know wicked and evil and a super genius and then for being this dumb model you know trophy wife that probably secretly hates Trump and they never pick a lane but I will point out the woman speaks what six languages yeah five or six nine five or six now well I mean this is an accomplished woman maybe Donald Trump didn't pick her out because of her command of serbo-croatian but you know still should this is an accomplished woman this is a serious person she's been graceful she's been all class and she's been first lady and they do nothing but ignore her and when they don't ignore her they smear her and they do this with every woman in the Trump administration she is that's true too you know that is true too I mean she has been absolutely startling only the only one who's been more startling has been Trump himself what a great job right he's done they have both done a tremendous job and they do nothing you're absolutely right Kellyanne Connelly Sarah Sanders the way they treat her is is a poor mock her appearance constantly I didn't they were all guffawing at the White House Correspondents Dinner when they were making fun of her smoky eye and her frown I said unbelievable and you know the thing is it really does point out that in each case and whatever identity they're creating whether it's gay people or black people or you know women whatever they do is always just about the leftism it is always to sell the leftism and you know what their big problem is the big problem is you can sell race stuff to people because a lot of races don't intermingle we self segregate so you can talk to black people about how evil white people are and they may not know that many white people but the problem they have with women is women know men they have nice husbands they have nice sons they love the men in their lives it's a little harder to sell them on this absolute crap they said that you're their friend that's such a good point because I think we're banking on during the the Cavanagh circus increasing voter enthusiasm among Democrat women and crushing it among Republican women in fact the opposite happened voter enthusiasm among Democrat women decreased by two points and among Republican women I think it was up over ten point that's yeah well let's let's hope let's hope that I know fingers what are you talking about on your shelf today we're gonna be talking about just this little news story of the day that that Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed crack a brewski right now with PJ and squeak but we're gonna be talking about that affair a bit and we're gonna once we get through all of that once we thank all of the great conservative heroes like Susan Collins and cocaine Mitch and where am i living right now once we get through that we will have to go a little more in-depth on the founder of our western new world civilization mr. Christian mr. Foote Chris MacCallum was my favorite tweet that went out over the weekend was from us I think was the daily wire one of the wags put up this thing with the leftist tears tumblr and just said I like tears I still like tears I know it's always great to talk to LC is it good to say it our and and right it's always this an easy segue to go from knowles to our crappy culture so you've probably heard about this this street artists British Street artist Banksy pulled off this kind of spectacular prank at a Sotheby's in London auction okay he has this very is most fitting the guy is nobody knows who Banksy is they have a lot of conjecture but they don't know he is and he's supposed to be but what he is a street artist he does graffiti but he has now become very popular and his stuff is very expensive and one of his most famous pieces is called the girl with balloon and it is a picture it's a stencil basically of a girl letting a balloon go it's a balloon is shaped it has a heart shape and it's become incredibly popular it's on all kinds of you know merchandise and things like this and it's and it's kind of a weird thing because when you first look at it looks like she's let her balloon go and it's flying away but then when you look at it more closely it looks like oh maybe she is actually releasing this balloon and letting go of her emotional life and becoming grown-up or whatever so it's sold out at this auction for over a million pounds I think in dollars it was 1.4 million dollars and after he hammered it down and we'll show it happening after he hammered down this Banksy had built into the frame a shredder and the picture then that the guy just paved a million pounds for was shredded by in the frame they stopped it about half way here's here's the the shot so southern say say they don't they they somebody says it doesn't didn't know that was gonna happen but I'm a little suspicious I don't know how you carry a frame like that it must be an incredibly heavy frame and of course now it's worth even more because it's half shredded they stopped it so now they've got their shredded bottom part coming out of this now as far as I'm concerned this is it makes somebody said we've been Bank seed or something like that in banks he put up a thing on Instagram saying going going gone and then he wrote the the urge to destroy is also a creative urge which is a quote that some is a tribute to Picasso I have to tell you what how I feel about this in terms of what I think of modern art I don't care if it's shredded or not it looks exactly the same to me but there is something I'm gonna go full conservative on you here because there is something genuinely decadent about this there's something genuinely decadent about this to say the urge to destroy is also a creative urge is like saying the urge to murder is the same as the urge to give birth I mean it is just not true the words can come out of your mouth but they don't describe the truth what you are seeing here is people with fantastic amounts of money fantastic amounts of money telling you that destroying the civilization is just as good as building the civilization and because of course for them it is for them they are gonna make money no matter what they're going to destroy the work of art this sell the work of art whatever happens they're going to come away feeling great and the decadence works great for the elite but for the rest of us this civilization was built up bit by bit every good thing we have was created by people working in the night fighting on battlefields thinking through their lives wasting their lives on thoughts that didn't go anywhere making works of art you can't tell me that to look up at the Sistine Chapel is the same as tearing this thing to pieces the only reason it's funny is because it wasn't worth anything to begin with it's a stencil it's not that big a deal that it gets destroyed but that's the only reason if you did that to the Sistine Chapel if you shredded the Sistine Chapel it would be a major major tragedy and so what I see in this is the kind of like cluelessness of the elites who are celebrating a decadent world where art doesn't matter where art destroying something is just as good as creating it because that world makes them a fortune that's the way it goes all right I am traveling I'm off right out of here I'm
