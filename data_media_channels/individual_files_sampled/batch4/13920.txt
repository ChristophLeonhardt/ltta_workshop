Senator Jeff Flake follows in the footsteps of his maverick Arizona colleague John McCain he's never afraid to piss off Republican voters the latest example flake on a book tour for his conscience of a conservative and obvious play on former Arizona senator Barry Goldwater's conscience of a conservative has been ripping president Trump up and down the book itself doesn't pull punches flake says that Trump was quote a candidate who entertained voters and offered oversimplified answers in an op-ed for Politico flake wrote quote we created him and now we're rationalizing him when will that stop that unnerving silence in the face of an erratic executive branch is an abdication and those in positions of leadership their particular responsibility so has Blake earned the respect of Democrats for his willingness to go it alone have Democrats cheered reflects a parent's intrepidity have they celebrated flake for speaking what they perceived to be hard truths about Trump of course not they rip them up and down from continuing to vote for conservative Policy Priorities here's the Twitter take quote voting in line with the guy you criticize is literally the opposite of intellectual honesty David Greenwald thanks for your op-ed Jeff Flake now back it up with reality on the Senate floor you're just too dishonest to cat with bat here's Alex Shepherd in the New Republic quote in this respect conscience of a conservative maybe the most clear-eyed and righteous takedown of Donald Trump from a Republican in office what the reader may not know about Jeff Flake and which he certainly doesn't reveal in his short book is that he's voted with Donald Trump 95% of the time according to 538 this is the problem for the left they don't expect intellectual honesty from Republicans they expect submission they want Republicans not merely to criticize obvious moral failings within the party or buck Trump on policy heresies they want Republicans to vote for Democratic priorities in order to fight Trump which is pretty convenient since they'd like Republicans to vote for Democratic priorities anyway if Trump were to push single-payer would they applaud Republicans for voting it down this is one of the big reasons Trump actually won in 2016 Republicans got tired of hearing that they must hold themselves to a higher standard when any standard other than complete surrenders to Democrats is insufficient to Democrats Democrats could cheer Ted Kennedy and praise him as the conscience of the Senate Democrats could openly state that Bill Clinton's myriad moral monstrosity or just fine and dandy so long as he protected the killing of the unborn our Republicans are expected to condemn immoral behavior and abandon their own principles if not they're hypocrites the predictable result a Republican Party that embraces the Democrats logic this should be a lesson for conservatives no matter how intellectually honest you are with regard to your own side no matter what moral standard you hold them - you'll be castigated alongside those whose behavior you condemn if you share political priorities that's not an excuse to toss morality out the window but it's certainly a reminder that the leftist priority here is not a more decent country but a more leftist one i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show is this real life is this just fantasy he was just

Sinestro Susie has a brand new book out that's already climbing about seller charts the big lie so have them on just a minute but first I would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to my favorite member of the Trump administration so far I'm really angry at the writers on the season of Trump I'm really upset with the writers on the season of Trump because I have to say this season Trump like if you're going to set up the Fonz you have to keep them around for a few seasons before you cap them you can't have the red wedding unless you have three seasons of Rob I mean you can't do this guys but you know in honor of Anthony Skinner Moochie I just want to take a moment of silence in memoriam Anthony Skinner Moochie the mood July 21st to 2017 July 31st to 2017 his epitaph I'm not trying to suck my own bleep Anthony Skinner Moche moment of silence folks ok well that's over so the mooch is now out and the and it's all hilarious and ridiculous I was trying to search for ways that this was done there were there were stories yesterday the mooch was ousted by John Kelly who's the new chief of staff that he came in he was sick of the mood the mood wanted direct access to Trump and John Kelly basically took him out and it looked a little bit like this from Braveheart in this particular scene from Braveheart you will be seeing when the part of King Edward Longshanks being played by John Kelly and the part of and the part of Anthony Skinner Moochie being played by random advisor to the prince it does not go well for for Anthony scare Malucci who is this person who speaks to me as though I needed his advice I have declared Philips my high councilor is he qualified I am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics ah ah and to me what advice would you offer on the present for much there he goes well that's too bad you know that said that there goes the mooch John Kelly taking control now the other one that reminded me of was was the scene obviously from The Godfather and John Kelly left the gun took the cannoli you leave the gun take the cannolis so legitimately yesterday at the White House the mooch is gone I'm really upset about this because the mooch was just wildly entertaining I would never run out of material if the mood should stuck around understand that in the space of 10 days he was hired by Trump he got Sean Spicer fired his wife left him and then he was fired ok that's that's the life of a fruit fly right there that's not even like a human life it's just amazing so yesterday after he was fired this shot was taken outside the White House this is not a joke it's a natural shot outside the White House for a couple of security guards taking a skeleton wheeling a skeleton outside the White House into everybody of course is saying well there goes the mooch just it's just really sad there are a bunch of funny memes that were going around there was one that was going around Kate Hudson actually tweeted out How to Lose a Guy in 10 days and it was a picture of Trump and skerin Poochie the good news for Skinner Moche of course is that his tenure at the White House lasted about five times longer than Britney Spears marriage to Jason Allen Alexander this is actually in a cartoon embodiment of scaramouche she's tenure at the White House and there he goes so what's hilarious about all this is it the only reason that this happened is the blowback was so strong that eventually Trump felt like he had to do something it is really funny to watch the members of the Trump administration get fired then the various excuses that are given for their firing so Bernie is so Sarah Huckabee Sanders she was trying to explain why Skinner Moochie was ousted yesterday I will I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you if you believe this explanation for why Anthony Skinner Moochie was let go scaramouche she said that he had a direct line of communication of the President there's been some speculation that general Kelly may try to tighten up a number of inputs that the president has so was something about the chain of command or did it have anything to do with that interview that's Karen what you mean was look the president certainly felt that Anthony's comments were inappropriate for a person in that position and he didn't want to burden general Kelly also with that line of succession as I think we've made clear a few times over the course of the last couple of days to several be individually but general Kelley has the full authority to operate within the White House they all announced a couple of maintained number one if you truly believe that Trump was shocked and appalled by Anthony scaramouche's language you are so dumb I can't even express to you how stupid you are if you believe that okay Donald Trump loves that stuff he loves that stuff spent the entire campaign saying that kind of stuff maybe that's just that's just silly so you can say that they wanted to bring in Kelly Kelly want a fresh start and Kelly wanted the guy out because of all of this but to say that Trump was just offended by his language I mean honest to goodness trumping offended by his language that's that's like saying that George Carlin was offended by his language that's just it no no that's just that's just silly hey by the way it's good in my view for the administration that Skinner Moochie is gone Pappy Kenan feels the same way you can't understand him the administration he says he's glad to dig out were too scared oh gee happen was the general came in general Kelly and he basically was by what scaramouche he said in the way he said it what he said about his colleagues this is not the kind of operation or individual that the general wants and his operation and he exercised immediate and swift and decisive command and got rid of an individual and it sends a message I think out to the country that you have a man in charge who is the chief of staff who does decide on people who are even those close to the president okay this is the new pet right Kelly is the new pivot and hen Kelly often scaramouche she is is the way that the Trump is now going to reestablish control over his administration so I want to talk about the ramifications of that in a little bit because I wonder whether it's true or not and what Trump is going to actually have to do in order for this to succeed before we do any of that I first want to bring on friend of the program obviously best-selling author the creator of some of the most successful documentaries in American history author of the New York number one New York Times best seller Hilary's America and now author of the brand-new book the big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left and Nesta sees a dinesh thanks so much for joining the show appreciate it hey Val eyes are good to be on the show so I just want to jump right into the book because I think that there's a lot of material in there that's vital for people to know the left is constantly suggesting that folks on the right are Nazis and we've seen them use this as an excuse for punching people we've seen them use this as an excuse for opposing politicians they don't like but essentially you make the contention in your book the big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left but the American left is significantly more tied to Nazism to National Socialism than the American right so what's what's the basic case for that well I'm making a contemporary case that is sitting on top of a historical case and the contemporary case is very simple that fascism at its core is the ideology of the centralized state Mussolini put it very well when he said nothing outside the state the individual is in a sense subordinate to a collective power well that doesn't sound like modern American conservatism it sounds a lot more like the ideology of the progressive left second fascist tactics now if we go and watch these anti-fog eyes the so-called anti-fascists they wear costumes they wear masks and hoods they carry weapons they not only block people and burn things and use violence but they use intimidation they're trying to terrorize people into submission and into silence they're trying to control the debate in the public square and in the onion on campus now does this sound like fascist this sounds a lot like Hitler's brown shirts or Mussolini's black shirts with the only difference being that the old fascist admitted who they were and the new fascists of posing as anti-fascist ones in issues some of what seems to me to be the problem in terms of the political lexicon is that European politics and American politics are completely dissimilar and so the Nazis may have been right-wing in comparison to the communist but that doesn't mean that their right-wing in comparison to American conservatives are very far left in comparison to American conservatives and you would see members of the conservative parties in Germany people like von papen people like Hindenburg all these members of the so-called conservative parties in Germany who were largely in favor of big government opposing the Communists and supporting Hitler's regime and so a lot of people have translated that over to say okay well American conservatism and German conservatism circa nineteen thirty two are exactly the same but as you make clear in the book that's not really the case at all yeah I think we have to back up a little further because the first fascist regime in the world was not Hitler it was Mussolini Mussolini in a sense was the founder of fascism as a political phenomenon Mussolini was a lifelong Marxist he was a socialist and his fascism grew out of that in other words Mussolini saw that the prophecies of Marx were not coming true and he thought that part of the reason for that is that people's loyalty wasn't just based on class it was also based on their love of nation and so Mussolini began to marry the concepts of nationalism with socialism creating if you will National Socialism later of course Hitler called himself a national socialist now what's remarkable is that now when we look back at all that the left has performed a kind of sleight of hand they've taken the socialism out of national socialism they've forgotten that these phenomena were on the left and they've sort of moved them into the right wing column where they can conveniently use it to bash Republicans conservatives and Christians now inertia in your book the big lie because this is a big question that Democrats are going to be asking is a question they asked to show to goldberg when liberal fascism came out which is are you really suggesting that today's Democratic Party are genocide all monsters who want to commit Holocaust because is that there is this sort of rule on the internet Godwin's law that whoever you know invoke the Nazis first loses the argument now there's no question left is invoke the Nazis first I mean they keep saying the donald trump is some sort of Hitlerian proto-fascist but you know the the question is going to be when you say that the the Nazi roots of the American left exists are you suggesting that the left is okay with the Holocaust are you suggesting that the modern left would be okay with the Holocaust what's the well how do you take on that particular issue you after World War two fascism and nazism became in erratically stained with the reputation of Holocaust without wits and so on and we look at those things now in that way it's almost difficult for us to understand why anybody would be a fascist given that this is what fascists did let's remember that that's not how fascism was perceived in Italy in the 20s or in Germany in the 30s and so part of what I try to do is recover that original meaning of fascism and and of Nazism even the left when they say the Trump is a Nazi they're not saying the trumpet started a world war and killed six million Jews what they're saying is that Trump resembles Hitler or circa in other words Hitler was a demagogue who promised the restoration of Germany Trump is promising to make America great again we're really arguing about fascism in its sort of original or germinal phase now what I'm saying is that there is a whole history of progressivism and of the Democratic Party being in bed with fascism and even early Nazism that was covered up after World War two and I bring all that secret history to light in the book from the book again is the big lie exposing Nazi roots of the American Left international last question for you because I know that you have a really busy schedule that the book was just released yesterday so what do you hope to accomplish with the book because obviously the left is going to claim that you're just trying to pander to the base and that you're trying to sell books by by using inflammatory language but what's your goal here well my goal in Hillary's America the previous book and movie was to take away the race card from the left which I felt that they were playing illegitimately against people us who are not racist and here I want to take away the fascism part and not just take it away but expose a whole facet of American history that as you may say been swept under the rug I think if people recognize the fascism is truly a phenomenon of the left and not of the right my book will have done its work the book again is the big lie exposing the Nazi roots of the American left it came out yesterday it's already soaring up the Amazon best hello let's let's make it a New York Times best seller as well dinesh really enjoying the book I'm in the middle of it right now and thanks for all the great work that you're doing out there appreciate it my pleasure okay so before we go any further I want to discuss the ramifications of the skin which we elster and what's going to happen next with Kelly and I want to give you the recap on the debate that I did a chanc yogurt on Sunday as well as I want to talk about a couple of major stories that are break inside the Trump administration plus I want to analyze that it's tisha bar it's the the most the most tragic day on the Jewish calendar let's talk about

people are treating this as though this is the beginning of the Trump pivot right Kelley is coming in Kelley's a four-star he is going to take control we talked about this a little bit yesterday and him firing Sierra Meucci is obviously the sign then now someone who's an adult is in charge there is one problem with this logic and that is this John Kelly is now in an unenviable catch-22 we have seen President Trump operate throughout his campaign and in his campaign we saw multiple quote-unquote pivot points right we saw manna fort was going to come in take over from Cory Lewandowski this was going to be the adults in the room then manna for was ousted and Bandhan came in and he was going to be the adult in the room and Callahan Conway was going to be the adults in the room and then after the admit he was going to be the adult in the room and then they were going to bring in general Madison general mattis is going to be the adult in the room now there is a difference in some of these people right so mattis obviously is the adult in the room on defense but he's not in the White House next to trump every day and the same thing is true with some of the other members of the administration we're doing fine jobs if you're not in Trump's immediate purview and your job isn't to control Trump then you can do a great job right you can be off to the side doing a wonderful job if however your job is to is to militate against Trump's obvious volatility if that is your job you are in a catch-22 because if you actually solidified Trump if you actually get Trump to calm down you're going to stop tweeting stupid crap and attack me is attorney general if you get him to start pursuing legislation instead of saying random things then one of two things is going to happen either Trump is going to settle down ha ha ha or you're going to be covered in the media as the guy who got Trump to settle down right the media is always going to treat Trump like he's a zoo animal and so if you're the person who tamed the lion what happens your face ends up on the cover of Time magazine just like Steve Annan and what happened after bannon's faces on the cover of Time magazine Trump got pissed at and began to began to marginalize him because obviously it was Ben and in control and not Trump or you got a lot of president Bannon talk well now you're going to get a lot of president Kelley talk right there's an a headline from the onion that ala pundit over at hot air took note of this headline over at the onion said US forces take control of Oval Office right the idea being the Kelley it's supposed to be funny right a US military occupation of the Oval Office but this is going to be the headline if things calm down now who's going to get the credit is it going to be Trump no and Trump unlike Harry Truman you know I'm like Ronald Reagan Harry Truman said the buck stops here Ronald ring said you can go you can get incredibly far when it doesn't matter to you who takes the credit Trump only cares about who takes the credit so if Kelly starts getting credit for calming him down then Trump is going to angry at Kelly he's going to lash out at Kelly this is what he does and if Kelly doesn't calm him down then nothing is really been accomplished here and it's going to look like even even John Kelly a four-star general wasn't able to get Trump under control I mean people are grasping at straws here there's really an attempt I think to paint this is another Trump pivot people are saying well at least Trump isn't tweeting yet guys it's been like 10 hours it's been like 10 hours I mean if I of our standards are this low then we should really think about whether we need to raise our standards a little bit it's just not me not not particularly not particularly smart like let's wait on this let's find out whether Kelly can get out listen I hope and pray Kelly can get this under control again you have your Republican president with the Republican House and Republican Senate things should be happening it's only going to happen if Trump gets his crap under control and the only way that's going to happen is if he starts listening to the people around him already you can see that the pressure is starting if I'm cut rump tweeted out this morning we look forward to working alongside general Kelly now we look forward to to not not I'm really excited that he's his chief of staff and we're all going to work for him right the line was as you saw from Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Pat Buchanan that everything was now going to run through Kelley early in February there was a report from Vanity Fair that everything was going to run through Reince Priebus how well did that work out if Ivanka and Jared decided walk in the Oval Office Sean Kelly is not going to be able to stop them and Trump is not going to stop them so I think that it's important to recognize that when there are gaps in policy not everything is going to go smoothly so we should just keep that in mind before we start celebrating and thinking that all the all the chaos is past okay meanwhile some of the Cavs I hope is past and because there's another story that came out yesterday that is completely wild from CNN we'll talk about that in just a second but for that you're going to have to go over to Daley wire calm and subscribe we're not just an audio show folks who

the reason that we hope that Kelly comes in and provides him so what it is because this is just a hysterically amazing story it is from Siena a self-described email prankster in the UK fooled a number of White House officials into thinking he was other officials including an episode where he convinced the White House official tasked with cybersecurity that he was Jared Kushner and received that officials private email address unsolicited Tom we are arranging a bit of a soiree toward the end of August fake turd Kushner wrote on an Outlook account to the official White House email address of Homeland Security Adviser Tombaugh sir it'd be great if you could make it I promised food of at least comparable quality to which we ate in Iraq should be a great evening Basra wrote back thanks Jared with a promise like that I can't refuse also if you ever need it my personal email is and then he gave his personal email the best thing however is that he pretended to be Sean Spicer in an email exchange with Anthony Skinner Moochie and this is just impressively incredible masquerading as Ryan Smith masquerading as that not not Switzer as previous masquerading as Ryan's previous the prankster emailed scaramouche's official account using a mail calm accounts on Saturday the day after previous resignation was announced quote I promised myself I would leave my hands mud-free wrote fake a previous but after reading your tweet today which stated how soon we will learn who in the media has class and who hasn't has pushed me to this that's who it was breathtakingly hypocritical even for you and then scare Moochie very real scary move he replied you know what you did we all do even today but rest assured we were prepared a man would apologize take previous wrote back I can't believe you're questioning my ethics the so called mooch who can't even manage his first week in the White House without leaving upset in his wake I have nothing to apologize for Ciara Moochie replied read Shakespeare particularly Othello you are right there my family is fine by the way and will thrive I know what you did no more replies from me also he pretended to be the ambassador to Russia designate John Huntsman and he wrote to and he wrote to Sierra Moochie whose head should roll first meaning Bannon or previous and real scaramouche II wrote back both of them hey this is all written to just a prankster who used their public government email address and wrote to them pretending to be another government official just amazing stuff guys please for the love of God get better I'm very fearful that you are going to write an email to another member of the Trump administration they're going to actually give you the nuclear launch codes like you must get better at this also worth noting when when the head of cybersecurity is handing out his personal email address I seem to remember this is not a good idea I think to remember like a three-year-long scandal because a particularly who random democratic party was using a private email address and private email server for political business don't do this people please don't do this John Kelly please please take control for the love of God please take control I beg of you please do it another bad story out of the White House today I don't want it to all be bad news because I think that I hope that John Kelly is going to take control there's a lawsuit that's out today you don't know who to trust in this sort of thing lawsuits all the time but now there is a lawsuit that is suggesting the plaintiff is rod wheeler his opossum News contributor former homicide investigator and he is now claiming that President Trump himself works with Fox News and a wealthy Republicans owner to push the south rich murder story I hope that isn't true because if so that's really gross but well we'll give you more information if more information breaks on that score okay so for those of you who aren't able to actually come out to my debate with Chang cougar it was I thought it was a great event 3,000 people showed up for the event they to move the venue because so many people showed up about 2,000 people were fans of the show fans of mine which is really fun and unexpected in the past debates including Chang have really been changstarr me outnumbering whoever the conservative is people like the Nash people like Ann Coulter but I thought the debate was actually really substantive I was not expecting it to be substantive to be completely honest with you I was expecting it to look a lot more like shanks debate with an ordinarily Dinesh where it was really a shank taking some piece that someone wrote ten years ago using it out of context and then turning to the crowd and calling them erases that actually didn't happen it turned out to be a pretty substantive debate I want to give you some of the highlights in case you weren't able to see it you can watch the whole thing on YouTube I was trending all day on YouTube yesterday it's trending all day on YouTube today hundreds of thousands of handsome millions if it's actually at this point when you aggregate them for this debate which I thought was really an important debate and actually useful important to MIT we talked about health care and taxes here are just a few of I thought the best moments for me and here is my explanation of capitalism shank contended that Kimsey anism was the was the best possible solution to making economic prosperity happen here was me debunking that the the problem of King Jian economics is that it doesn't even work in theory because again once you go to the logical extreme which is remove all of the money from the rich people who are saving all their money and give it to all the poor people to buy hamburgers that doesn't help the economy or spur the economy what Spurs the economy is a higher level but but Spurs the economy is the creation of new products and services and that is only going to be done by people who have expendable capital to actually invest in new products and services that we all enjoy what creates economic growth it's also worth noting that this myth that spending is inherently better for an economy than saving that's only true if you're talking about somebody's actually taking the cash for just shoving it into their mattress banks are in the business of lending when they take the money in they go just stick it in Al Gore's fake lockbox they actually lend the money back out to people to actually create new businesses a new product you had an investor right when you start at TYT you're given four million dollars my buddy roemer to start qit that's great that's the way business should work right but that money has then come from bunch of poor people buying hamburgers it came from a very very wealthy guy who gave you money to create a business a lot of people want to patronize if you want better products and better services you need more investment in the products and services the basic name triple down economics the basic name circle down economics is not something that any conservative even proposed it's a leftist revision of what economics actually is because you're not giving me the money it was my money in the first place created through voluntary transactions that I had with others I've not stolen money from either from anyone neither have you and the idea that money has to be forcibly taken from you and handed to somebody at the bottom end of the economic spectrum to somehow job the economy that made job McDonald's but it's not going to job all of the creation of the products and services that make all of our lives much better today than they were 30 years ago in terms of the stuff we have access to so as I say I think there was a really substantive interesting debate I wanted to make a few notes about Medicare because chanc was talking a lot about Medicare in this debate he talked a lot about the glories of Medicare how popular it was just because the program is popular doesn't mean the program is actually good I talked about the cost of Medicare there's a 43 trillion dollar outstanding debt on Medicare that's how much money it's going to cost the United States according to a columnist over at National Review I want to get his name Michael tanner this is a he gives some good statistics on all of this he points out that not only is there 60 billion dollars in fraud and improper payments in Medicare per year but right now if somebody pays into Medicare 10 kept saying you pay into Medicare and get out of Medicare what you pay into Medicare is not what you get out of Medicare a married couple with two average earners turning 65 and 2020 will pay about 150 thousand dollars in Medicare payroll taxes over their lifetime given their life expectancy they can expect to receive almost five hundred thousand dollars in benefits that means that you're going to spend an enormous amount of money beyond that Medicare is not actually doing that great a job because a lot of doctors are not accepting Medicare anymore they won't set new Medicare patients because Medicare reimbursement rates are simply too low so just because there is Medicare doesn't mean that everybody takes Medicare which is why a lot of people are forced to pay out-of-pocket it is also true that according to according this column not only will this force even more physicians out of the program according to the actuaries at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services the combination of effect leads to roughly half of hospitals 70% of skilled nursing facilities and 90% of home health agencies losing money by 2040 which will lead to widespread closures you pay people too little money and they're not going to actually succeed also the Journal of American Medical Association has found that for 16 of 40 and indicators Medicare patients received less recommended less care than two-thirds of the time the rest of the less care then recommended two-thirds of the time other studies have shown that Medicare patients receive a lower quality of care than do similar patients with private health insurance a journal study in the Journal of Health Services found Medicare coverage at 65 for the previously uninsured is not linked to improvements in overall health status we've seen that with Medicaid as well there is no advantage to actually being on Medicaid in terms of life expectancy and health outcome so probably talk about Medicare for all it costs a lot of money and it ain't that effective and it drives doctors out of the program it leads to rationing by the way as I've said before I don't believe that the government should be involved in health care health care is an individual decision that you make and there should be a social fabric that picks up the pieces for people can't afford for themselves but if you were to have some sort of program the most effective program in terms of health insurance is the Swiss Program the Switzerland mandated program where you all buy health insurance just like car insurance but it's almost entirely privatized the problem there is that the number of people who are not able to get the insurance that they want to get is like 31 percent because obvious debate when it comes to health care you can only have when it comes to health insurance in health care about both of these things well health care really when it comes to health care you can only have three things right you know affordability universality quality you can have two of those three you cannot have all three Obamacare has created more universality it has not created more quality and it is not created more affordability and chain kept saying no no you can have it all you can have a cheap you can have an effective you can have it for everybody no that's not true because there's no area in life where you can make something cheap and effective for everybody unless you have a free-market system driving prices down in quality up anytime you have a mandate all that does is it drives the quality down and the price is up which is exactly what's happened with Obamacare other things from the debate that were fun there was a Shanks big thing is he doesn't like money in politics and I was pointing out to him that money will always be in politics and that's not a bad thing considering that we spend lots of money here at the Daily wire on bringing you political material Chang spends a lot of money over at TYT bringing people political material pretending to my $200 donation to a candidate is the same thing as Chang spending millions of dollars to bring his particular political view to the public which definitely Ford's the agenda of particular politicians that's just silly money is a form of speech we all know this because this is why we wouldn't allow the government to come in and shut down the New York Times on the ground that hey after all they're just spending money it is in speech I made this point to changqin rather colorful fashion your government is in the business of regulating business what would be the problem with the government telling Buddy Roemer he is not allowed to invest in your business no that is no no's a true termination is no problem no problem no it is one thing is to say hey let's set reasonable limitations on what can happen around elections which is again what most developed Western countries do so and they have different versions of that rule there's ads you can run you can't run as within a certain period of time your public financing versus private financing those are rules around an election that is completely different issue than the government saying randomly you can and can't invest in businesses while you're conflating those two issues that have nothing new with one another why so let's just out work we remember why me it has Gozer because hey why you know you believe in education I believe in health care because it's a because it's a free country and I get to spend my money wherever I damn well please and then finally Chang had said something he was trying to make a distinction between money and speech when it comes to politics and so he said well if money is just speech then why isn't all money just speech well money for political speech is political speech money on other things is not but in any case he compared it to prostitution he said well if money is just speech then why can't I just you know go spend money on a hooker and call it speech here was my response when you say money in politics that again I asked you buddy roemer gave you four million dollars to start TYT what did he expect in return should he not have given you money was money not speech it was just money i Prost with a hooker I assume so argue the prostitute how's this one yeah it got interesting so if you missed the whole thing then you can go and check it out on YouTube we also have it up on my Facebook page as well we are releasing clips of it too it was it was a lot of fun it's about an hour long she shouldn't take too much of your time but we'll be releasing some of the better clips from it as time progresses okay time for some things I like and then some things I hate and then I want to talk about tisha Bob which is the the Jewish fast day that we are that we are participating in today so things I like so we have been paying tributes of scarer Moochie I didn't know is gonna be fired yesterday but we started our tribute to skirmish yesterday with Wall Street today I want to pay tribute to scare Lucci with another with eight with another clip from movie that is just very scary Lucci this of course would be the same Terry Ellis from die hard one of my favorite characters in film history and you will see the mooch and all of his mannerisms and all of his speech and it is just phenomenal hope I'm not interrupting what is here on it's not what I want is what I can give you boy let's be straight okay it's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck up here to snatch a few purses am i right you're very perceptive I watch 60 minutes I say to myself you guys are professional they're motivated they're happening ie they want something huh now personally I couldn't care less a bunch of politics have you pissed off at the camel jockeys maybe it's the heaves northern Alan it's none of my business I figure you here to negotiate am i right you're amazing you figured this all out already hey hey business is business you use a gun I use a fountain pen what's the difference put it in my terms you're hearing a hostile takeover you grabbed us for some green mail but you didn't expect some poison pill was going to be running around the building am i right Hans Bobby I'm your white knight must have missed 60 minutes - what'd I say my god stairs things up huh I can give him give ya so now watch die hard what unfortunately what happens to to the mooch in this movie is also what happened to mooch politically so things go very poorly for me I wonder what happened to Hart Bochy or our posture had a bit of a career being like a jerk he was he's in a great movie that I've recommended on the show before called called Breaking Away he's a villain in that movie as well he's just terrific in it I'm not sure what he's been doing lately apparently a lot of TV I'm looking up his IMDB right now looks like a lot of TV stuff but he's not in it he hasn't been in a lot of big stuff really since the 80s they starting to do a lot more TV like in the last three or four years I miss you heart botcher come back and play the mooch I mean come on it's most obvious casting of all times probably a little old for the part now but fantastic in any case okay time for some things that I hate so the first thing I hate is the Democrats the left they just can't stop they can't stop with the the comparisons that are that are actually insulting so when I do all of this it's all in love okay it's all is all in fun I mean this is all ridiculous the left treats Trump like he's an actual dictators is Dinesh said before they try to suggest that he's Hitler in Chris Matthews about to freeze for him for you Chris Matthews on everybody say you study about Trump purging administration and kind of like you know it's kind of up to worst dictators in history purging the administration take me by shooting him during the ditch during the type of river letting wash up later a bloody and disgusting Trumpy the words that Kim Jung a go with the regularity of the nightly news president Trump is throwing bodies out of the White House at a rate that matches the Russian Revolution I think all this going around and purging people just like Kim jung-un what is he doing knocks off always relatives when he gets scared when you get scared of your position you start killing people around it we don't do that in this country we fire them Trump seems to know how to fire that's my argument my argument is you terrible person I get for the morning I look at my hair it's all messed up get a show breasts my everything show job better out myself and I start things you like kim jungeun well not really I'm going to say it anyway because come on is inflammatory Mussolini Hitler Kim Jong un boo Chris Matthews MSNBC so I'm again Democrats you might want to just point out the fact that this is more incompetence than it is malevolence it's not like you brought in the mooch because he wanted to kill the mood which okay he brought in the mood because the mood was wildly entertaining and again I am so sad about all of this I mean you don't get rid of the Fonz before he can become your breakout character he was your uncle he was your the Fonz you don't get rid of the breakout character guys come on come on okay the other thing that I hate Jeffery Lord comes out and he says that when it comes to Trump they're talking about how Trump spoke at this police academy and he said something about how you know if you're putting people in the car and you don't put your hand on top of their head that's okay that's okay they just killed somebody you know okay whatever and people oh he's for police brutality I think Jeffery Lord is right about this but I want to make a point about what Jeffrey the Lord says Jeffery Lord says this is just trumping in New Yorker I think to actually correct here is ear Lord okay I have to say he's in New Yorkers standing in front of New Yorkers on Long Island my whole family's from Rockman that's the way they talked okay that's 100% true so I was in New York last week and I was walking along the street and there was a shirt that said that this is literally what the shirt said it's just in a store window fu you effing eff right that's what the shirt said and I thought this could not be on sale anywhere else in the United States like legitimately nowhere else in the United States who do there be anyone who buys this shirt this shirt is probably a best seller in New York and that's why Trump won he won because the rest of the United States takes his tough talk and his brash nonsense really seriously in New York is just a cabdriver everyone talks like Trump in New York right when people are doing the well the mooch is copying Trump's hand motions with all this stuff no the mooch is just from New York okay so people from New York talk like this and that's why nobody from New York takes Trump all that seriously but in the rest of the country uses this inflammatory language and everybody goes oh you must mean it because around here oh and we see f you you effing eff you must have like punched my sister in the face or something for me to say that no in New York that just means that you're standing in line in front of me and you didn't move up quickly enough in the line right so so that's why it's not worthwhile taking Trump's rhetoric super seriously on the stuff like oh he's calling for police brutality no he's just a guy from New York okay so today is in fact despite the show today is in fact the most solemn day on the Jewish calendar it's why Jews have been fasting from last night to tonight no food no water that's real bad glass but but tisha Bob the reason that it is the it is the most solid in Jewish calendar a bunch of bad things - traditionally happened on - Shabaab to the Jewish people so in 1313 BCE spies returned from the promised land and gave a bad report about the promised land in 423 BCE the first temple was destroyed on the Temple Mount in seven DCE the second temple was destroyed on the Temple Mount in 1492 the Jews were expelled from Spain's the state has some sort of particular cosmic significance obviously when it comes to God now I want to talk a little bit about what the significance of the day is aside from bad things happen today to the Jews so we commemorate that so the typical lesson from tisha Bob which means the ninth of of it's the month of oven the Jewish calendar it's you know Jesus would have would have would have celebrated the month Bob for Christians out there and it's just have Jewish calendar works it's the ninth of object and the most famous story in the Talmud about this I talks about why it was the temple was destroyed so we don't tend to do this now now when bad things happen when world events happen we tend not to attribute them to specific causes in the past that was much more common if you read the rise and fall of the Roman Empire the the authored given he goes out of his way to actually try and explain what the causes are for the fall of the Roman Empire we today something bad happens we don't know what was the cause of that we just assume that it happened in Jewish philosophy there's a thought which is the Second Temple fell because what we called C not phenom meaning unrooted hatred I just hatred for no reason and there's a story about what that meant in the times the time it's an apocryphal story but it's kind of informative so the story goes like this there was a banquet in Jerusalem at the time of the Second Temple and there's a very rich wealthy guy who had an enemy whose name was whose name was Bar khamseh he also had a friend who's in with Kamsa he had this big feast and he wanted to invite Compson his friend instead he invited Bar khamseh biaxin and his messenger went to the wrong guy once a bar Kamsa and bar khamseh shows up at his feet thinking okay we're going to make nice now they see bar khamseh sits down he starts eating and me and the guy who's throwing fees comes up to me because what the hell are you doing here I don't want you here you're a jerk and bar comes to listen you know now you're there are lots of people here I don't want to be humiliated you throwing me out of here I'll pay for my own meal I'll give you money I'll get to stay here was what's the you know what's the problem and guy says no I want you out of here forthwith bar Thomson was so angry about this and so angry there were a bunch of rabbis there who didn't actually do anything that he immediately went to the Romans and apparently gave them security information about the way that the the Jewish rebellion that the way the Jewish rule was working and and then supposedly gave them the impetus to come in and destroy the temple and just rend dispersed the Jewish people that's the story it's apocryphal right I mean there's not a lot of historic evidence that's the way that it happened but that is the story the way that it happens in the Talmud so what does that mean that doesn't seem like baseless hatred right it seems like Barr commsta has a pretty solid case that something bad happened to him but here I think is the point of that particular story and we should take it to heart because it has some impact on politics in the United States and for Western civilization and that is baseless hatred is about you attributing motives to people that you don't actually know that's what baseless hatred is because if you know what somebody's motive is then you have a good reason to hate them if they did something wrong to you you hate them that seems not like c9p Nam it seems just like xenon it just seems like anger and hatred but the point here is this this guy was so angry at the person who wronged him that he decided the entire society had to pay society at large was responsible for the sins of this one man and therefore society at large had to pay the system was corrupt and bad things wouldn't happen in a / in a non corrupt system therefore the system had to be torn down this is always the danger to systems of thought it's the danger to Judaism it's the danger to Christianity people do this all the time and see an Orthodox Jew who does bad things and they say well he's a bad guy therefore Orthodox Judaism must be false he's just a Christians all the time that guy says he's a Christian but did you see what happened to those priests in the Catholic Church Christianity must be complete nonsense if people can do stuff like that you can't attribute to a system the actions of an individual people do this with America all the time individual active racism it's because America is racist therefore America must be destroyed and replaced by something better that destroys the temple that destroys the temple the idea the temple can still be pure even if people who visit the temple or participate in services is the temple or give money to the temple or not and we need to identify individual sins for what they are rather than attributing to a broader society the motivations of the sin if we don't do that we are engaging in baseless hatred not only against one another but against the society at large and that's what tears down civilization ok so I will send the rest of the day in fasting in prayer which is one of the things that we do and I hope that you have a more enjoyable day than we will and we will be back tomorrow to discuss all the latest in the ongoing circus that is American politics I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show
