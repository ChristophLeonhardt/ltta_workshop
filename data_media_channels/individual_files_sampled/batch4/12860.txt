we're joined right now by Bridget fantasy Bridget thank you for being here thank you see you may well house we you know I love your writing thank you coincidentally you happen to experience probably the biggest TV phenomenon in person up close maybe up a little too close I didn't think I would ask this question on the Michael Noel's show what made you join a sex cult I was traveling I had booked a one-way ticket and just trout we wanted to put a backpack on and travel and I went with this guy that I met in Sydney we went up to the coast and it was their holidays and he assured me that there would be a place to stay in Byron Bay and I got there and there was nowhere to stay and he was having a boy's weekend so he being not a gentleman it's basically like you're on your own girl I just met Bridgette I don't know if that's not like just being not a gentleman like if I'm not a channel maybe I don't pick up the tab at dinner or something but I've never ditched my date for a sex cult and so I ended up looking on woofing I was subscribed to all these different sites like couchsurfing and woofing and I looked on woofing and they had an ad for it was just like a spiritual retreat is what they called it whooping is that's the organic thing is worldwide organic farming if you're traveling on a budget it's a great way to go around and you work four hours a day for somebody on a farm and then you can go do whatever you want if you're you're it's a good way to get around the world and places like Chile and New Zealand in particular and Australia and then I was like oh spiritual retreat that sounds you know harmless enough and I went and they they said oh there's a car in town right now getting supplies we can pick you up today and I said perfect right and then they showed up and they were all in white with beads and crazy eyes and they all had crazy eyes they definitely had that about like the look where just I don't know if it is just the brainwashing that happens that your eyes it's like disconnected a little bit
