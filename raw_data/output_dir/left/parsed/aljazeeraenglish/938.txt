an ancient land at the crossroads of
Europe and Central Asia
some say the Garden of Eden was here it
is a land rich in history and blessed
with abundant natural resources
this is Azerbaijan a land which after
decades of communist rule is today
witnessing a resurgence of faith in
Islam
Azerbaijan embraced Islam when arab
invaders brought the religion to the
region in the seventh century
faith in Islam took firm root here until
the region came under the control of the
Soviet Union in the 1920s this marked
the start of an era in which atheism
became state policy many Muslim leaders
were exiled or killed mosques were
closed or destroyed despite years of
state oppression towards religion many
people here in Azerbaijan held on to
their faith
since regaining independence in 1991
many Azerbaijanis have once again turned
to Islam seeking to reassert their
identity and fill the ideological vacuum
left behind by the collapse of the
Soviet Union
this is Samira Salim OVA a 31 year old
mother of two she is one of the Muslims

Samira was exposed to Islam from an
early age as a teenager she started
going to the mosque where she learned
how to read and write Arabic it was her
great-grandmother who strongly
influenced and shaped her faith the soul

Samira is part of Azerbaijan's majority
95 percent population who consider
themselves Muslim but more significantly
she belongs to a minority who actually
practiced the religion older Muslims
like her mother
have lived their lives without observing
the Islamic codes and more often than
not don't feel the need to start now
yet Samira's mother still desires what
every Muslim wants they had a tizzy the
old romantic you sort of it won't you

since the collapse of the Soviet Union
and the downfall of communist ideology
hundreds of new mosques have been built
old ones have been restored and new
religious schools have been opened
Azerbaijan has witnessed something of an
Islamic revival interest in Islam
appears to be really stronger than ever
while many Azerbaijani Muslims remain
more secular than those and other
Islamic countries there has been a
significant growth in religious practice
and belief over the last two decades
Kamel alma madoff is another example of
someone who has embraced Islam
now
Kamel was born during the era of the
Soviet Union at a time when any faith in
God was frowned upon even condemned he
was brought up in an environment of
communism in which there was no place
for religion since the downfall of the
Soviet Union karma like most of the
other young men and women and Azerbaijan
have been trying to find their way in a
rapidly changing society camels life

encouraged him to do the same

pilgrimage to Mecca is both a literal
journey of worship and a symbolic
renewal of a sense of purpose in the
world

camels friends have come to see him off
Samira is also getting ready to leave
she is anxious about the trip Samira
remembers to call and thank her mother's
friend who made the trip possible
Oh
unlike most of the other pilgrims Samira
is not traveling to Mecca by bus
her mother's friend has been generous
indeed buying her a plane ticket so she
is off to the airport to catch a flight
to Saudi Arabia Samira however is
feeling mixed emotions
