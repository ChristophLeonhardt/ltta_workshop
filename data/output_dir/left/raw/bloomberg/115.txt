1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,780
The cubical represents a tyranny that confines
your imagination and thoughts are confined

2
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,260
to a small physical area.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,260
Imagine pretty much every software engineer
or finance person being able to disconnect

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,160
from their desk and look at holographic monitors
on a beach and doing their work from there.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,390
that’s not going to be science fiction
- it’s the modern office place.

6
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,360
Silicon Valley is all about building the future.

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,780
A startup called Meta thinks it’s getting
there first, thanks to a big bet it’s made

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,280
on Augmented Reality.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,360
How are you?

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,740
Good, Thank you.  Welcome to Meta.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,700
Thank you.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,780
Call it a 360 degree office where you can
spatialize your thoughts as part of your workflow

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,980
for education, architecture, design, engineering,
etc.

14
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,250
People often mix up Augmented Reality with Virtual
Reality.

15
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,930
VR totally blocks your ability to see or
hear the real world.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,710
AR overlays holograms onto what you already
see.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,650
Meta has tried to make its version of the
workspace feel familiar.

18
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,049
You grab the hologram, instead of using a
controller or a mouse and your brain already

19
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:20,040
knows how to do it.

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,100
In other words, we’ve designed an operating
system that

21
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,580
humanity has always known how to use.

22
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,560
So you can see this eyeball, which is, by
the why, photo-realistic.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,720
You can see my hand is including the eyeball
and now the eyeball is including my hand.

24
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:33,729
Right.

25
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:34,729
See those two circles?

26
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,259
They get small and then they turn into this
glowing white ball and then I can move my

27
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,619
hand around super naturally.

28
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:42,979
I can do this with two hands and I can rotate
the thing, I can stretch it.

29
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:47,780
I can throw it back into the shelving system
and that’s all you have to learn to become

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,909
a modern worker.

31
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,700
And to prove this, the employees at Meta have
started to get rid of their computer monitors

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,680
-- trading them in for Meta’s augmented
reality headsets.

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,740
Meron thinks it will be less than a decade
before we'll all be wearing strips of glass

34
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,640
that can project holograms.

35
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:13,900
 

36
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,600
In the early 80s, everybody had computers
on their desktops but nobody was using them

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,200
because they had a lot of work to do.

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,080
So they were still using typewriters.

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,700
At some point the CEO took all of the typewriters
away and everyone was forced to use the computers

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,840
so it’s very exciting to see a new generation
of technology, a new paradigm.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,460
I consider us like pioneers in the holographic
wild.

42
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,320
I’m, you know, pulling up my browser with
my hands and I’m sending out emails to my

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,520
colleagues and just kind of really acclimating
to the new environment.

44
00:02:44,520 --> 00:03:00,340
 

45
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,560
Now you’re putting on my computer essentially.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,290
Our digital lives live on our phones they
have all of our pictures and notes and things

47
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:16,240
- so why don’t you write yourself a little
sticky note.

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,049
Go ahead and take your first right over the
sticky note and close your fist.

49
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:21,540
And now….

50
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,960
What?!

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:30,060
Meta’s own transition to Augmented Reality
has run into plenty of unexpected problems

52
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,829
and it’s still gonna be a while before you’ll
start to see these devices in YOUR office.

53
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,349
But I think it’s a future worth waiting
for.

54
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,730
If we could see these holograms between us,
we will have been able to share our work with

55
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,160
one another more naturally, more efficiently
and more productively than ever before.

56
00:03:51,160 --> 00:00:00,000
Humanity will have evolved slightly.
