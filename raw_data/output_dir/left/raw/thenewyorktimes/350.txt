1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,230
This was something that was
online for less than 24 hours,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,860
and it has dominated my
life for three months.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,560
“There’s this online
spreadsheet of men in media.”

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,320
“What they’re accused of
doing, who they work for.”

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,350
“It’s unverified, anonymous …” “It does raise
these questions …” “Smearing someone …”

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,790
I actively tried to avoid
this.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,970
I’m a very private person.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,030
“How do they get their reputation back?”

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,230
I did not want this kind
of attention to be on me.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,750
I did not want to be a
person who was sitting down

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,880
with The New York Times.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,750
“Are you a little nervous right now?”

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:42,190
Yeah! I created a Google
spreadsheet called

14
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,300
“Shitty Media Men” that could be
shared and anonymously edited.

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,330
The idea was that
women could use

16
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,330
it to name somebody
who had behaved badly

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,750
towards them, whether through
sexual assault, or rape,

18
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,310
or harassment.

19
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,990
I shared it with
some women colleagues

20
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,730
and friends in my industry
whom I knew had stories.

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,560
And then from
there, they sent it

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,810
to people they knew had
stories, and they sent it

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,220
to people they knew had stories.

24
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,094
And by the time I was
forced to take it down,

25
00:01:14,094 --> 00:01:17,080
which is about 12 hours
after I created it,

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,060
there were more
than 70 men named,

27
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,550
and 14 had their
names highlighted

28
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:25,480
in red to denote that there
were more than one woman who

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,030
were accusing that
particular person

30
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:37,010
of violent physical
assault. Some of the incidents

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,125
that were described
there gave me nightmares.

32
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,210
Some of them were
really very violent.

33
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:53,140
When I was watching
the spreadsheet fill up,

34
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:55,900
it became clear to
me that a problem

35
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,950
I had already understood as
widespread was, in fact, much,

36
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,020
much broader.

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,730
I didn’t really know what to do.

38
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,530
I was overwhelmed.

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,960
I was terrified.

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,949
“What was your biggest fear
about your name becoming known?”

41
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,256
There is a long history
of violence against women,

42
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,380
and it’s particularly acute
for women who speak out

43
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,740
against misogyny and sexism.

44
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,857
There are things like, I used
to, like a lot of New Yorkers,

45
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:24,940
just walk around with
headphones in all the time.

46
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,481
And I can’t do that
anymore because I

47
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,040
have to be more aware
of my surroundings

48
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,180
and who might see me
or be following me.

49
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,250
If you are accepting this
as just the way things are,

50
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,980
then you’re sort of
accepting that you’re

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,990
going to be treated
badly, and your colleagues

52
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,010
are going to be treated badly.

53
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,450
And, you know, women
you’ve never met

54
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,700
are going to be treated badly.

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,250
And I didn’t want to
accept that anymore.

56
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,820
So I decided to
make a first attempt

57
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,460
at trying something else.

58
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:02,170
Listen, I made the decision
to create this spreadsheet,

59
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,700
so its flaws are my fault.
But there was this obstacle

60
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,730
because the conventional
reporting avenues for women

61
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,790
who have experienced sexual
harassment, or assault, or rape

62
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,900
are really not good ones.

63
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,770
The document that I made
was designed to be private,

64
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,864
but it very quickly went viral.

65
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:21,780
I want to emphasize,
though, that I don’t even

66
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,240
know who saw it, or who
had it, added to it.

67
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,820
Those women are
anonymous to me as well.

68
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,020
But at the same
time, I could see

69
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,990
that what was going on on
this spreadsheet was also

70
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:38,220
this act of real solidarity
and community among the women

71
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,620
who work in this industry
to attempt to keep one

72
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,630
another safe. So much
of the conversation

73
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,870
after the spreadsheet
was made public

74
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,670
was about the methodology
of the spreadsheet

75
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:55,330
and sort of the tactics
that anonymous women were

76
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,490
using to try and
keep each other safe.

77
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:01,720
People were more worried
about a hypothetical man

78
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,220
whose reputation might be
damaged than real women who

79
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,240
were really raped.

80
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,060
“It’s not a
hypothetical man, right?

81
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,730
There were men who were
named on this who had

82
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,510
to suffer repercussions
in their real life.”

83
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,829
Some companies decided to
conduct investigations.

84
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,960
Not all, but some
of them did result

85
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,350
in men leaving
their jobs or being

86
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:31,756
fired because they were found
to have committed wrongdoing.

87
00:04:31,756 --> 00:04:33,130
I think it’s their
responsibility

88
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,630
that they acted that way.

89
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,827
Harassment, assault, rape.

90
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,660
These things don’t
happen like the weather.

91
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,285
You know, they don’t
happen by accident.

92
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:42,370
They happen because people
make a choice to do that

93
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,550
to someone else.

94
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,860
There are a lot of conversations
to be had about sex.

95
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,750
We’re not done
talking about sex.

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,250
“Hey hey, ho ho,
sexual violence has got to go.”

97
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,680
There’s #MeToo in
2017, 2018.

98
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,030
In 2014, there was
#YesAllWomen.

99
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,400
And in 1991, there
was “I believe Anita.”

100
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,890
“I thought he respected
my work and that he

101
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,780
trusted my judgment.”

102
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,080
So it can feel like
we’ve been defeated,

103
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,130
right? Because if anybody
had listened to us

104
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,010
the first time we wouldn’t
have to say it again.

105
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,180
But I think that every
time we get a little louder,

106
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,850
and we get a little closer
to making the changes that

107
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,960
actually need to be made.

108
00:05:21,970 --> 00:00:00,000
What I think is next is a
lot of hard work for us all.
