00:00:07,073 --> 00:00:09,609
IS THAT WENDY, KNOWN AS AN AVID

00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,352
DETERMINATION OF THE STABILITY 

372
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,387
OF THE BUILDING AND WHEN WE DO 

373
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,090
THAT, IF THEY SAY IT IS STABLE, 

374
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,858
WE WILL PUT PEOPLE IN THERE. 

375
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,193
WE ARE WORKING WITH THE 

376
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,060
BUILDING OWNER TO GET FENCING 

377
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,796
AROUND THAT PROPERTY AND WE 

378
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,530
WILL HAVE A CRANE COME IN AND 

379
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:19,865
USE THAT TO CHERRY PICK WHERE 

380
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:21,867
WE THINK THE FIRE STARTED TO 

381
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:23,235
LOOK AT THAT SCENE. 

382
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:26,105
WHEN WE GET THERE, WE WILL 

383
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:27,673
START WALKING BACK THROUGH AND 

384
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:31,010
IF IT'S STABLE ENOUGH, WE WILL 

385
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,077
GO THROUGH ALL THE FLOORS WITH 

386
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,679
A SECONDARY SEARCH TO MAKE SURE 

387
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,347
WE DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING. 

388
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:38,083
>> THE LAST TIME IT WAS 

389
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,184
INSPECTED, DID YOU KNOW 

390
00:13:39,184 --> 00:13:40,218
ANYTHING ABOUT SPRINKLERS AND 

391
00:13:40,218 --> 00:13:40,452
ALARMS? 

392
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,421
>> THE BUILDING WAS INSPECTED 

393
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:43,555
BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT A YEAR 

394
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,190
AGO AND IT WAS INSPECTED BY THE 

395
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:49,428

396
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,997

POLICE SAID THEY HAD NO PRIOR 

411
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,990
CONTACT, AT LEAST I DON'T 

412
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,525
BELIEVE THEY DID. 

413
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,528
IT DOES APPEAR IT WAS JUST A 

414
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,661
RANDOM ACT OF VIOLENCE. 

415
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:25,630
THE SUSPECT IS NOW IN CUSTODY 

416
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,900

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,402
THE LAST FEW HOURS AND DAYS THAT

00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,636
THE SUSPECT WAS STILL AT LARGE. 

419
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:32,571
POLICE ARE SAYING THEY ACTUALLY

WE WILL FOLLOW THIS. 

423
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,112
IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRESS 

424
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,547
CONFERENCE IS WRAPPING UP AND 

425
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,515
WE WILL PIVOT TO ANOTHER STORY.

MONTHS WORTH OF RAIN FOR THE 

434
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:57,062

435
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,764
THOUSANDS ARE STILL LIVING IN 

436
00:14:58,764 --> 00:15:00,499
SHELTERS AS THE WATER RECEDES. 

437
00:15:00,499 --> 00:15:01,433

446
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:17,383
I APPRECIATED. 

447
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,386

448
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,854

449
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:22,321

IS REALLY DIRE. 

452
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,458
PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES AND 

453
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:32,064
BUSINESSES. 

454
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,867
THEY LOST LIVESTOCK, CROPS AND 

455
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,703
THERE WAS LOSS OF LIFE, TOO. 

456
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:40,539
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO EVERYONE 

457
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,173
IMPACTED BY THIS STORM. 

458
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:41,974
THE RIVERS ARE STILL CRESTING 

459
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,841
