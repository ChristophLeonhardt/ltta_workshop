welcome to the show called things older people say my back hurts well don't do a show called things young people say I feel fine right what happens is as you get older you think it's gonna all be gradual you know like you know because you're because you're after all aging gradually right I mean you're just going day after day and then month after month and year after year so why shouldn't everything else be that gradual that's not how it works at all all of a sudden your knee blows out and it's gone forever but never have that knee again die so I'm telling you I know this seems bleak and I don't want it to be bleak what I'm trying to say to you is live for today you know that whole thing the Buddhist thing the Native American thing that the right thing the spiritual thing lives are today live for the moment do it because the knee is going away enjoy
