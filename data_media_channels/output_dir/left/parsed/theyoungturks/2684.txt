YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP OF
COURSE FIRE JAMES COMEY, FORMER
HEAD OF THE FBI.
WHY?
HE SAID ON
NATIONAL TV IN AN INTERVIEW WITH
NBC, BECAUSE HE WAS
INVESTIGATING RUSSIA.
THANKS FOR
ADMITTING OBSTRUCTION OF
JUSTICE, BUT HE'S NOT DONE YET,
HE ALSO WANTED TO GET RID OF
JEFF SESSIONS, THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL, BECAUSE HE WASN'T
SUFFICIENTLY LOYAL ENOUGH.
HE
LET ROD ROSENSTEIN, DEPUTY
ATTORNEY GENERAL, PUT A SPECIAL
COUNSEL.
SO HE'S AGITATED, HE
WANTS TO FIRE EVERYONE
INVESTIGATING HIM.
I WONDER WHY,
I WONDER IF IT'S BECAUSE TRUMP
IS A CRIMINAL WHO WANTS TO HIDE
HIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY?
OKAY, SO
NOW WHAT DOES HE WANT?
OKAY, IT
TURNS OUT AXIOS HAS NEW
REPORTING --
>>SO IT TURNS OUT CHRISTOPHER
WRAY, THE HERO IN THIS STORY.
I
DON'T KNOW CHRISTOPHER WRAY'S
POLITICS AND GIVEN THAT HE WAS
APPOINTED BY DEEPLY RIGHT-WING
FORCES MY GUESS IS THAT HE'S NOT
GOING TO AGREE WITH ME MUCH
POETICALLY.
BUT IF YOU STAND UP
TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO
DESTROY RULE OF LAW IN THIS
COUNTRY, DESTROY OUR
CONSTITUTION AND SYSTEM OF
GOVERNMENT, THEN GOD BLESS YOUR
HEART, YOU ARE AN AMERICAN HERO.
AT LEAST ON THAT.
AND BY THE
WAY, COMEY, FOR ALL HIS FOIBLES
AND UPS AND DOWNS, REMEMBER,
FORGET TRUMP, FORGET CLINTON, HE
ALSO STOOD UP TO BUSH WHEN BUSH
WAS TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE RULE
OF LAW JAMES COMEY STOOD UP.
HE
STOOD UP TO TRUMP WHEN TRUMP
DEMANDED LOYALTY AND SAID YOU
BETTER BE LOYAL TO ME AND AND
THE INVESTIGATION OF FLYNN, AND
COMEY DIDN'T DO IT, THAT'S WHAT
HE WAS FIRED.
SO THERE ARE A
COUPLE OF HEROES IN HER
GOVERNMENT.
MORE --
>>SO THERE IS SESSIONS TRYING
TO PLEASE DONALD TRUMP, GOING,
YES, AFTER YOU TOLD ME I SHOULD
RESIGN AND I'M A LOSER AND I
SHOULD BE FIRED, OKAY, NOW I'LL
DO WHATEVER YOU SAY, DEAR
LEADER.
AND HE GOES TO FIRE THE
DEPUTY DIRECTOR TRUMP DOESN'T
LIKE BECAUSE OF THE
INVESTIGATIONS OF HIMSELF, AND
IT DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE WRAY
STANDUP, AND EVEN THE WHITE
HOUSE COUNSEL SAYS DON'T DO IT,
IT WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE MESS.
NOW, WHY DO YOU THINK DONALD
TRUMP IS TRYING TO FIRE EVERYONE
WHO IS INVESTIGATING HIM?
BY THE
WAY, ALSO PEOPLE INVESTIGATING
RUSSIA, LIKE PREET BHARARA DOING
A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION OF
RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS IN THE
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MANHATTAN,
AND THEN EVEN THOUGH TRUMP SAID
HE WOULD STAY ON HE WAS FIRED
IMMEDIATELY, AND THE CASE WAS
SETTLED.
RIGHT AFTER THAT THE
RUSSIAN OLIGARCHS WERE FREE TO
GO.
THEY PAID A MINOR FINE IN
THAT CASE AND THEY WRAPPED IT
ALL UP.
SO FIRE ANYONE WHO IS
INVESTIGATING DONALD TRUMP OR
THE RUSSIANS.
GEE, I WONDER WHY.
BUT I'M TOLD THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE.
GOLLY GEE, WHAT WOULD
BE THE CONNECTION OF RUSSIA AND
TRUMP?
TRUMP BEING WORRIED ABOUT
A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF
HIMSELF, WHAT WOULD GIVE YOU
THAT IDEA?
YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE
BLIND NOT TO SEE THAT DONALD
TRUMP IS TRYING TO COVER HIS OWN
ASS AND FIRE ANYONE WHO
INVESTIGATES THEM.
GEE, I WONDER
WHY.
I HAVE A GUESS, BECAUSE HE
FUCKING DID IT, THAT'S WHY.
WAKE
UP.
