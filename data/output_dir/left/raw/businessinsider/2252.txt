00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,080
dogs tend to howl because the part of

their social repertoire part of their

vocal behavior for communicating with

interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the different type of</font>

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,390
vocalizations dogs have our function of

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,170
what they're trying to accomplish if you

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,850
think about growling which is sort of a

9
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,579
low sound is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> Curt at a short</font>

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,320
distance but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to say</font>

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,329
you're too close I don't want you to

12
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,059
come any closer to me howling has the

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:47,700
opposite purpose it's you're far away I

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,320
want to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you I want to</font>

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,090
gather so a howling is really a

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,370
gathering sound and acoustically it

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,469
actually carries farther than the growl

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:58,199
and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose of the howling</font>

19
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:00,090
by a dog they're lonely and they want

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,829
you to come to them or they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,840

acoustical signature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> siren will</font>

24
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:11,159
sometimes mimic the the frequencies that

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,750
you'll hear in the howling so it

26
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,970
stimulates that in the dog and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dog</font>

27
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,049
will holler along with it

28
00:01:19,740 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh
