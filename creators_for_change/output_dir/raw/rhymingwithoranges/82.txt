hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube so it was inevitable that</font>

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,009
i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make this video I kind of</font>

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,620
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it off for as long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I</font>

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly could seeing as also I've</font>

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,490
already covered this topic with my

6
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,960
friend Jimmy on our channel device

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">honorable you can watch the discussion</font>

8
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we had on scottish independence</font>

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,490
here but with the vote coming this

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,699
thursday in under a week and the vote

11
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,210
being so close i need to articulate my

12
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,488
fears on this issue I just thought this

13
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:35,700
by saying that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English</font>

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,399
and I think it's completely right that

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,760
the Scottish people have a vote and I

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,500
referendum to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to decide their</font>

17
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,530
own country's future and their nations

18
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,030
and the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their people I think</font>

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's great that Westminster have</font>

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,520
granted the Scottish the chance to

21
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,800
decide their destiny as it's being

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,870
called quite a lot I don't want to wade

23
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,100
in and say that Scottish people

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,300
shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> having about because I</font>

25
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that most English people agree</font>

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,420
that they should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a vote and</font>

27
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a very important topic for</font>

28
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,530
them to be engaging with and it's only

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently that we've had to consider the</font>

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,150
actual ramifications of Independence

31
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,869
getting a yes vote because it's it was

32
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:18,060
so stacked in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no votes favor for</font>

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,640
such a long time for ages they were in

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,710
the 16 the seventy percent and there was

35
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,600
no way that independence was going to be

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,430
able to win<font color="#E5E5E5"> that over but in the last</font>

37
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,979
couple of weeks the<font color="#CCCCCC"> polls have been</font>

38
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,960
getting really really really close and

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,450
this makes me very very nervous last

40
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,829
weekend there was actually a poll that

41
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">showed that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> S vote was ahead by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,340
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two percent in case it's not obvious</font>

43
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,460
at this point I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want Scotland to</font>

44
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,890
leave I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> desperately don't want</font>

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,100
Scotland to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> because completely</font>

selfish regions it screws with my

47
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,119
identity I want up a few English people

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,619
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that actually feels more British</font>

than they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> English my primary identity</font>

56
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,340
you start

57
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,690
boating around the idea of putting a

58
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,640
border between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries where I</font>

59
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,430
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strongest roots where before</font>

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,120
there was none that on a very personal

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,209
level kind of screws with my head a

62
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:27,739
little bit it may seem a little bit

63
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">pointless for me to be talking about my</font>

64

the border but making the decision and

66
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,310
who should quite rightly be having

67
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,099
identity crises but I fear that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

68
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,959
what this debate<font color="#CCCCCC"> has turned into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

69
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,940
debate has turned into the throwing and

70
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,489
spewing of ideology and nationalism

71
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:46,430
anti-english feeling that's been really

72
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun and that's not what independence</font>

73
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,680

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">about concrete facts and we haven't had</font>

75
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,450
those facts the Scottish people deserve

76
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,700
answers on EU membership currency

77
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,060
Trident the<font color="#E5E5E5"> military and Westminster has</font>

78
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,980
not given that to them and that's out of

79
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,860
order but because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Western has been dealing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with this the</font>

into the referendum on Thursday voting

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,069
on a wish list that nobody knows will

84
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,620
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> true they're voting on a list that</font>

85
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,600
the SNP has written for Santa Claus and

86
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,540
Santa Claus is like not doing Christmas

87
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,450
this year not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">people that was a terrible terrible</font>

89
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,739
metaphor I also<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the split</font>

90
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,420
that this is creating in Scotland

whoever wins next<font color="#E5E5E5"> week is going to be</font>

92
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,730
winning by a tiny margin whatever way it

93
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:39,590
goes on Thursday whether they vote to

94
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,269
leave or they vote to stay there's going

95
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> half the country that don't</font>

96
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,440
want that future and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,329
split Scotland right down the middle if

98
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,750
the no vote succeeds if the no vote if

99
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,310
the Scottish people vote no and they

100
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,720
decide to stay part of the united

101
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,090
kingdom we will inevitably have<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

102
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,730
referendum in<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time if the</font>

103
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Scottish people vote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yes and they decide</font>

104
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,200
to go their own way and split away from

105
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
the United Kingdom<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the borders go up</font>

106
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,500
half of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be part</font>

107
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,120
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that future of the country and</font>

108
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,190
there's no going back from that I feel

109
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,139
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be better for Scotland to</font>

110
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,500
vote no and then when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

111
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,079
devolution max which seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be what</font>

112
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,719
the no vote is promoting at the moment

113
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,280
as the alternative when they get

114
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,450
devolution max

115
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,490
see how they<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it and have another</font>

116
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,020
vote in 10 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> it feels like jumping</font>

117
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,470
into darkness<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody knows how deep</font>

118
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,960
it is you get my drift do you get my

119
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,730
drift see I understand the idea of

120
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,400
nation building and I love the idea of

121
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start again and I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,170
and Westminster is pretty clamp at the

123
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,820
moment I understand we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

124
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,070
incredibly under-represented government

125
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,200
I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of them have been to a</font>

126
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,060
non private school most of them have

127
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,650
been to Oxford and Cambridge there's a

128
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,200
load of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them that are from Eton they</font>

129
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,140
don't represent us and there's been a

130
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,350
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pandering in Scotland too we</font>

131
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,730
didn't vote for the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are now</font>

132
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,160
in Westminster well I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bloody vote</font>

133
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them Eva that's democracy get over</font>

134
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,820
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing is what an independent</font>

135
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,020
Scotland would leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind as a country</font>

136
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,900
that I would struggle to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

137
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">will probably end up leaving the</font>

138
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,230
European Union our immigration policies

139
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,090
will go even further to the right our

140
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,410
NHS will probably be privatized more and

141
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,340
that breaks my heart because in many

142
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,870
ways the gravitas of Scotland has kept

143
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,530
the rest of the UK on track and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

144
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,300
basically you're us over this is

145
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,710
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> a difficult video for me to make</font>

146
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,590
because I feel so strongly about it

147
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,460
every time the<font color="#CCCCCC"> polls get released every</font>

148
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,500
day on the radio<font color="#CCCCCC"> on TV my heart just</font>

149
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,910
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ngila because I I care so much</font>

150
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,160
about the result<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I case so much</font>

151
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,060
about the UK remaining the UK with

152
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,740
Scotland as part of it so a flag<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

153
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,190
 if Scotland leaves I mean come<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

154
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,200
it's got piss yellow on it that said I

155
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,930
cannot reiterate enough how important it

156
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,190
is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the Scottish people's</font>

157
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,200
