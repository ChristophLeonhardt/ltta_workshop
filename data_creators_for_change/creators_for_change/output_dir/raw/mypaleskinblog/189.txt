00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,040
hi guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and welcome back so I've</font>

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,220
realized that i've never actually filmed

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,240
a favorites video before and I thought

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is just not good enough so today</font>

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to be talking you through my</font>

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,470
februari favorites but this is also

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,720
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be my january december november</font>

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,609
blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be my</font>

9
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:26,340
februari and everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

10
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,099
liked long enough before that to put

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,969
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my very favorites so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

12
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,230
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I'm going to talk about</font>

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">today but it's a product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I used to</font>

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">use all the time but I haven't used for</font>

15
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,870
quite a while and that is Nivea cream

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,219
this stuff sells for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pound I</font>

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,579
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one I paid one pound</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 97 for</font>

18
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,489
or something ridiculously<font color="#E5E5E5"> precise like</font>

19
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,609
that and the reason that it's one of my

20
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,680
favorites at the moment is because this

21
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,250
does not break me out Nivea cream for me

22
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,950
is an absolute lifesaver although it

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,130
does make my skin slightly oily I find

24
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,799
that since I've switched to it from

25
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:16,860
higher end brands my skin has<font color="#E5E5E5"> plastic</font>

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lee improved and I don't know what it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,409
about Nivea cream that works well for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

28
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,920
it does you know is so thick and there

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,890
is nothing new about it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

30
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,590
the simplest things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the best and my</font>

31
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,079
skin seems to be reacting quite well to

32
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,500
it which is always a good thing so I'm

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to keep on using bits so for me</font>

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,630
Nivea cream is definite favorite at the

35
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,850
moment when the mostest of trying to

36
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,610
repair my skin<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have acne is you guys</font>

37
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,100
know and I'm trying to combat that I'm

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,560
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get rid of it I thought it</font>

39
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be a really good exercise and a</font>

40
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,250
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea to have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look back at</font>

41
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,469
what products I was used in last year

42
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,469
and see if I can reintroduce those into

43
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:03,689
my daily life and see if they make any

44
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:05,420
difference at all to my skin

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">vitalii or unsurprisingly they have</font>

46
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,400
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> made difference so this scrub</font>

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,610
is the only essential smoothing face

48
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,280
scrub for normal to dry skin at the

49
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment my skin is reacting so much</font>

50
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,230
better 25 pounds worth of drugstore

51
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,390
products then it dudes<font color="#CCCCCC"> too when I was</font>

52
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">used in a three and Japan skincare range</font>

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,390
so for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> skin the moment price is</font>

54
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,760
irrelevant because it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

55
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,220
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a really high-end skin product</font>

56
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,830
because if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and</font>

57
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,740
a 2 pounds product is get the two pounds

58
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,260
product that is what I've lived that is

59
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,860
why olay is now also in my favorites as

60
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,110
well terms of makeup favorites I've

61
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,130
really been liking the knicks studio HD

62
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,170
photogenic foundation this one is in

63
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,130
shade nude which is 0-1 this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a</font>

64
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,230
funny foundation because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

65
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,330
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first started using it was quite</font>

66
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:06,540
pale as I got more towards the bottom it

67
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,240
started getting darker but made me

68
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize that I probably should have</font>

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,480
shaken it from the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I bought</font>

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,730
it and does it say shake well doesn't

71
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,400
say shake Bob and so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
may be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of pigment stuck at</font>

73
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,690
the awesome I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be digging out and</font>

74
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,790
so I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to retire this one</font>

75
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,330
soon the other thing i find this one is

76
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">although i do really really like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it find</font>

77
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,950
that you get through the bottle really

78
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,590
quickly I don't know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I seem to have</font>

79
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,970
powered through this foundation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

80
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,500
like it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the finish I've</font>

81
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">used it in a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of videos now and to</font>

82
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,900
me it is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice foundation I just</font>

83
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,360
don't get why it's getting darker

84
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,510
towards the bottom but whatever i'm

85
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to keep using it it's nice i'm</font>

86
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to order another one and hopefully</font>

87
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,330
it will arrive soon so that's my

88
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,730
foundation favorite currently my next

89
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:09,209
beauty favorite is the benefit roller

90
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,200
lash mascara I had no idea I would love

91
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,640
this mascara so much

92
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,209
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the wand on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind</font>

93
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:22,570
of curved um and it's just a really

94
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">great mascara you actually do feel it</font>

95
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,180
pulling that your lashes you do feel it

96
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,400
lifting up and you do actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice</font>

97
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,950
different I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my lashes do</font>

98
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking very long they do have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

99
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of volume but not as much as you get</font>

100
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bourgeois volume luxe clubbing</font>

101
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,490
mascara for example but they aren't

102
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">elongated and they are long and then do</font>

103
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,740
hold a curl which is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

104
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,030
important things that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

105
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a mascara so this one is definitely a</font>

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,130
favorite and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy to take</font>

107
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,290
off as well which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is always a good thing</font>

108
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,870
because i don't like tugging at my

109
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,110
lashes but this one works wonders for me

110
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,840
so the benefit roller lash is definitely

111
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,150
a favorite for me this month the next to

112
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,010
make up products that I've been loving

113
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,850
are the bourgeois color band I shadows i

114
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,590
received a bunch of these bourgeois

115
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,590
holoband I shadows from bushwa<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I</font>

116
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,910
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks before they came</font>

117
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,790
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just sat in my</font>

118
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,940
drawers on board come on um I didn't

119
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually use them and then one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day I</font>

120
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,210
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do my makeup</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to do</font>

121
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,190
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> new because I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to</font>

122
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,990
be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same products all the time</font>

123
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,660
so I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move one at these</font>

124
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,720
pencils and I was like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> God why</font>

125
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,970
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> I not been touched these before and</font>

126
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,520
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really like them I like</font>

127
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,010
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> smooth they apply I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how you can</font>

128
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,960
blend them out with your finger or you

129
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,760
can blend them out with a brush and they

130
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,890
just look so seamless they have really

131
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice colors in the range and I just find</font>

132
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they are perfect everyday looks and</font>

133
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,190
every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

134
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,350
something up or try something new I

135
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they're so affordable so easy to</font>

136
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,060
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they are definitely one of my</font>

137
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,729
new favorites I will say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

138
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:12,460
lighter ones so something like this one

139
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,800
which is beige minimalist the color

140
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,470
isn't as strong and it doesn't show up

141
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,830
so much on your skin as if you had you

142
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,979
know the darker brown or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray so do</font>

143
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,220
be that in mind

144
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,770
maybe try a primer underneath it and you

145
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,930
might get better results but that's

146
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,000
probably due to how close it is to your

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,630
skin tone otherwise really really loving

148
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,610
them final makeup product that i've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

149
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,970

160
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,740
recently because the last one I tried

161
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,140
did break me out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> my skin hates</font>

162
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,050
everything and this one I haven't had

163
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,240
any issues with one thing that I would

164
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,580
say with this one is be careful<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how</font>

165
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,070
much you use because I find it it can

166
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,960
look a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit cakey just under the</font>

167
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">eyes and across the bridge of the nose</font>

168
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,000
so do bear in mind that a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">this powder does go a long way and do</font>

170
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,700
try not to over powder because you will

171
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,910
see the layers building up and it will

172
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,590
start to look a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit kinky but</font>

173
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,919
otherwise at five pounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty for a</font>

really good powder it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

176
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,450
pro powder and it is definitely one of

177
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,870
my everyday ways right now that is it

178
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,900

just ramble for about 20 minutes and

182
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,080
some of this was remotely useful at all

183
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,120
it probably wasn't but I really hope

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,060
