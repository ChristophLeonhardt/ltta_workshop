Widow the golden eagle. She's an
extremely unique bird.
She circles over our head
anywhere from 500 to
four or five 5,000 feet.
When you take a bird that
you know from ground zero
and you train it, you watch it learn
how to fly, and you see it
catch its first rabbit or
whatever that is,
you can see the light
go on in that bird.
And you can see it becoming an
eagle right in front of your eyes.
So he's great, yes 
he's better.
And then as it gets closer and
closer to release time,
you can see the light come on
their eyes and they really tell
us it's time to be turned
loose.
You know it becomes kind of
bittersweet because you've
worried about this bird, you've
taught it all these things but
yet now you have to turn it
loose and hope that what you've
taught it or, or the experiences
gained with you
is enough to have it survive.
