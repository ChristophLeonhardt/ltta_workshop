saman Coonan was a retired Thai Navy SEAL diver who was brought back to help with the operation to rescue the stranded football team and their coach he was part of the SEAL team with the British divers who found the boys early Friday morning he was ferrying air tanks deep in the cave he passed out underwater a fellow diver pulled him out and attempted to resuscitate him he died from lack of oxygen his death underlines just how risky the conditions are it takes six hours to reach the boys and their coach and involves a series of complicated dives the effort to find another way to get them out is picking up pace the drilling is ongoing on the western side of the mountain aiming to reach the location where the truck boys were found we can't yet to pinpoint the exact location using global positioning systems otherwise we could drill into the cave and bring them out but another team is specifically focused on finding their location above ground using technology and equipment that can detect fault lines underground we use this to send and receive wave signals we can gather information that can be used to find the boys location in the cave from above the ground even with all the technology being deployed and the hundreds of rescuers working around the clock the biggest threat remains to be something that nobody has any control over the weather one heavy rainfall could undo days of work and the families continue their wait at the mouth of the cave hoping for a communication line with the boys and their coach to be completed it was supposed to be up and running days ago Scott hi there al-jazeera Chiang Rai
