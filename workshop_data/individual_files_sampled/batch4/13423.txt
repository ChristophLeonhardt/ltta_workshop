so for all the talk about Donald Trump's weirdness in this particular election cycle it turns out that Hillary Clinton and her team are way way weirder the media have simply chosen not to reported on Friday WikiLeaks filled an email showing the Clinton campaign chair John Podesta was invited to a spirit cooking AB speared by marina abramovic along with Jon's brother Tony as power to sell a report spirit cooking often incorporates human elements particularly blood breastmilk urine and sperm in ritualistic cooking its origins are found in cake of light a supposedly spiritual foods ingredients include plenty oil menstrual blood and sperm like this is really a real thing in a reddit forum Abramovich told users the context of the ritual depends heavily on intention performing it in a gallery or a studio makes it art performing it in the confines of one's home makes it more intimate and spiritual Abramovich also recommends eating the pain after cutting your middle finger using fresh urine to wash away nightmare dreams and mixing fresh breast milk with fresh sperm milk for earthquake nights this is real but Trump is the weirdo Hillary's oddities gone unreported by the media for literally decades according to Bob Woodward Hillary bought cheated Houston Clos director of the foundation for mind research for the White House when Hillary was first lady there Hillary held seances with Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi she said she thought it would be a step too far talks of Jesus though Hillary wrote that Eleanor quote usually responds by telling me to buck up or at least to glow skin as thick as a rhinoceros Hillary by the way also likes to throw back the alcohol for former campaign manager current corrupt Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe she said quote she loves to sit throw them back we all hear about the story she and John McCain actually had a shot contest I think in the Ukraine or somewhere around the world and she actually beat John McCain in the shot contest at a quote so Hillary isn't exactly the paragon of stoic sobriety she's an odd lady surrounded by odd people will do odd and terrible things as president just don't expect the media to report it I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show okay lots to talk about today and and I want to start by apologizing for some of the technical oddities on the show obviously for watching this on Facebook live for watching it on daily wire that's just because I'm broad I'm over in Austin and Austin as a blue area has decided that censorship is obviously the best possibility in any case lots going on let's start with this Podesta story because everybody's covering this a little bit wrong I mean there's no evidence that John Podesta is a Satanist yeah there's not there's evidence the Marina Abramovic is a weirdo and the John Podesta is a weirdo and a Tony put us two they're all weirdos there's no evidence that they go around worshiping vehicles worshipping Satan and honestly having Alex Jones and company pushing theories about the occult and those being taken seriously let's not go over the top they're weird that should freak you out but it's more about them being environmentalists wildlife weirdos then it has to do with them worshipping Satan I don't I don't know any evidence today worship Satan per se it seems bad enough to me that they're ingesting food made from other people's sperm by the way is there has there ever been a plenty scandal doesn't involve sperm yeah I think we're still searching for a Clinton scandal that doesn't involve sperm I think but meanwhile it's pretty clear that the the left is freaking out right now here's where the polls are so according to the Real Clear Politics poll average Hillary has moved to a little bit more of a lead than she had yesterday but in the State polling here's where we are in the state bowling Hillary with one point two percentage point lead in Florida if she wins Florida the elections over Trump with a three point three percentage lead in Iowa Ohio Clinton up three in Pennsylvania that's very narrow New Hampshire with tongue up 1.5 Trump up 0.8 in North Carolina Clinton up 2.6 in Colorado Trump up two in Nevada and in Wisconsin to Hillary's up big Michigan she's a big Maine she's up in Virginia she's a big Georgia Trump is up i aux represent so what does that mean what that means that this entire election as always seems like it's gonna come down to Florida if these polls are right now my own suspicion is that Trump's lack of a ground game means that he's going to underperform a lot of these polls but I will say that it's so volatile there's really no way to tell at this point in the 538 broadcast in the 538 calculation they say that there's about a three point lead for Hillary Clinton their averages now making about a three point lead for Hillary Clinton and so the Democrats are panicking and they're making asses in themselves as usual except more than usual so here is Barack Obama yesterday very very upset Donald Trump who says the Donald Trump is bad because he only hangs out with celebrities you spent a lot of time with celebrities spends a lot of time hanging out with the really wealthy folk but you don't see him hanging out with working people unless they're cleaning his room or mowing the fairways on his Golf Club you're gonna make this guy your champion if you're a working person somebody who spent his life without ever showing any regard for working folks but he has insulted minorities and immigrants and Muslims and Americans with disabilities that's the voice you want you want a voice who's bragging about how being famous lets you get away with what would qualify sexual assault and cause women pigs and dogs and slobs okay we can stop it there so Barack Obama goes down he says he only hangs out with celebrities he doesn't care about working people in any real way okay really really okay so he doesn't care about working people in it but from but but presumably Obama does Obama spends all his time pretty much every single day meeting with celebrities in fact there's somebody online who's saying that President Carter the defense secretary is actually the President of the United States Obama is just the celebrity in chief and it's pretty clear that that's how Obama sees the presidency one of the great ironies of this particular election cycle is that President Obama can't believe that a reality TV star like Donald Trump might take his place the great good God came Barack Obama might be replaced by this dumb by this dumb ass Donald Trump but here's the here's the real out of the reality of how people see Barack Obama they don't see Barack Obama as some great statesman they don't see Obama the same way Obama sees Obama Obama sees himself is a great world leader Obama sees himself as a great god genius Obama sees himself as this wonderful fellow who's gonna lead us from the darkness to the light most Americans see Barack Obama the same way they see Lady Gaga except he has more power and he doesn't do this many weird sexual things on tape that Barack Obama is just a celebrity to them this is why celebrities worship Obama so Obama ripping on Trump from meeting with celebrities I mean the fact is that Trump celebrity connections are so much less than Obama's celebrity connections to make your head swim I mean Obama is constantly meeting at the White House with everybody from 9/11 truther math or more to Beyonce who talks from teamily about what she wants to do with her P word in her songs and that's no problem for Obama so one of the big problems with American elections now is that it's impossible to make a credible charge against your opponent because everybody's in the gutter so Obama says that Trump is a celebrity that's true but Obama's a celebrity and he's the one who made it that way he's the one who solicited that he's the one who has sought celebrity status by going on Samantha be like three days ago so again none of this washes Obama by the way acknowledges that Hillary Clinton is really a bad candidate it should have invested in the clothing industry before this election because there are so many people who are holding their noses and voting it's just absolutely insane here is President Obama holding his nose about Hillary Clinton when I hear young people who tell me well you know I'm not that interested or I don't think my vote makes a difference or even though Trump is terrible but you know Hillary is not exciting me that's when I hear that stuff I I just have to have to say the world is imperfect politics is imperfect candidates are imperfect I'm imperfect you make choices you decide on what is best in this particular situation and in this particular situation it's not even close Hillary Clinton is somebody who's qualified to be president and cares about the issues that Millennials care about and will maintain the progress that we've made over these last eight years I love it I mean President Obama they're basically praising himself to the sky like well I like the point where he says I'm imperfect and you can see that he thinks he's lying down President Obama's saying yourself remember I'll have nobody nobody's perfect except for except for me but he's basically admitting there Hillary's awful you just have to vote for Hillary to stop Trump on the other side you have everybody saying the opposite you have everybody saying they have to vote for Trump to stop Hillary nobody likes to Lori nobody likes from it's awful and you can see that the Democrats are freaking out about this because if this election is a referendum on Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump Hillary loses that's the way this works when it was in referendum on Donald Trump Hillary was winning because nobody wants to see Trump be president if in the American mind this referendum this elections now referendum on Hillary Clinton Hillary's in serious trouble because nobody likes her so it really is a mindset if the media covers Hillary more in the last week and a half leading up to the election major advantage from if they covered some moreover the weekend major advantage to Hillary Clinton and that's why I see two Democrats in panic mode two Tim Kaine the presidential candidate he's whining now the Congress is saying they're going to investigate Hillary Clinton he's desperately trying to get the attention off of Hillary Clinton in the last days of this election cycle people are on the impeachment word around before the election has even taken place I mean first it kind of suggests a little bit of defeat isn't like well we think we're probably going to lose second it also suggests a really bad view of what the role of a legislator is shame about this investigation stuff oh you know I thought legislators were supposed to legislate I mean investigations are part of it but the real issue is legislation so I hope folks voters will hold them accountable don't tell us just what you're gonna block tell us what it is that you want to do yeah it's supposedly about about legislation that's the real problem here is that the legislation as all has all broken down it's a minute isn't how they're trying to shift blame we need a lot of the Democrats are complete disarray Bernie Sanders he's out there campaigning for Hillary and he's at the same time Barack Obama's friends get off the boat on the basis that Barack Obama is the greatest president ever and we have to continue this winning streak Bernie Sanders is out there saying oh by the way Brock Obama's not a very good president and things up for grabs Bernie Sanders final note from from socialist septuagenarian Bernie Sanders okay so Bernie Sanders is very upset about the state of the economy real unemployment is too high we need more socialism except for the fact that you need more black voters to show up in vote and you got a problem there because black voters aren't interested in voting for Hillary Clinton Robby Mook who is Hillary's communications director he's out there trying to get the focus off Hillary Clinton saying Hillary's been cleared and she'll be cleared again none of this is a big deal I am totally confident when the FBI says what they have they get the information out there there's gonna be nothing new he said he didn't even know what the emails were we found out he didn't even have a warrant to look at them at the time he sent out the letter we're just saying get the information out there on the table the voters are smart Hillary has been cleared on this she'll be cleared again and we'll move forward and focus on what we care about in this election which is kids and families and how we're helping people afford education and health care you know I needs a big round of applause of course from the audience of the view for that but the fact is that most people don't think that Hillary is necessarily going to be cleared unless something really really corrupt happens now all of this would be good news for Donald Trump going into the final weekend except for Christopher McChrystal so you remember Chris Christie he's the fellow who's been destroying the Republican Party for the last eight years so chris Christie I have never seen any one person had this sort of impact on a presidential on presidential races two times in a row if you remember back to 2012 Chris Christie spoke at the Republican National Convention he'd been vetted for vice-president and rejected because Mitt Romney thought that he was kind of corrupt and Chris Christie still got the keynote at the RNC where he proceeded to spend the entire keynote talking about how wonderful he was instead of talking about Mitt Romney his speech bomb then you remember the week before the election he hugged President Obama talked in glowing terms about what a great guy President Obama was how President Obama was was this great fellow for coming down to New Jersey right after Hurricane sandy and they walked arm-in-arm down the Atlantic City Boardwalk and they they made sweet love under the trees at midnight and barack obama ends up winning the election narrowly in large part because of the the backlash to to hurricane sandy and the feeling that did he do good a job during hurricane sandy and and chris christie helped push that perception this year chris christie was responsible for the murder suicide to took out marco rubio the guy who's most likely gonna be the nominee if chris christie hadn't excoriated him in that new hampshire debate leading donald trump to quash Rubio's momentum in new hampshire let me get Trump is the nominee that's bad enough now to of Chris Christie's top aides have been convicted on all charges in Bridgegate that's going to be the news the media run with this weekend Chris Christie's the head of Donald Trump's transition team into the White House obviously the media are going to now attempt to ship their coverage away from Hillary's corruption to Chris Christie's corruption and therefore Trump corruption that's gonna be the message so well done chris Christie you are absolutely indisputably be absolutely worse and meanwhile the fact is that you know the Christie surrogates are doing the term surrogates are doing him no great favors obviously and I'm sorry we
