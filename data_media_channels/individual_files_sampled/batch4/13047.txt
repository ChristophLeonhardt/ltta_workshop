all right I'm gonna get to the news in just a second first I want to talk to you about why you should have some of your money in precious metals so if you look at the trade situation right now President Trump obviously wants to raise tariffs on countries like China China is raising tariffs on the United States in response and you could easily see a trade war well this is going to have some pretty significant ramifications for the currency considering that China actually could retaliate against the United States by selling off American bonds for example well what that really means is that you ought to have at least some of your assets in a hard asset like gold where you should have some of your assets not all right you should have a lot of your assets in stocks and bonds great I have a lot of that stuff in stocks and bonds too but you should have some of your assets and precious metals because my savings plan in every savings plan should have something that is not subject to

President Trump is Hitler right President Trump is a Nazi and the reason President Trump is a Nazi is because of his policy of separating children from their parents at the border when people enter in the United States not at ports of entry when they enter across the border in Arizona for example or Texas and they're picked up by ice then they are immediately criminally prosecuted and that means that by law their kids have to be separated from them and this means that Trump is evil-eye Trump is totally evil now you might ask yourself did this policy begin with Trump and as had been saying for well on two weeks now no this policy did not begin with Trump this policy began with Barack Obama whose policy in 2014-2015 was that he would arrest entire families and keep the kids unified with the parents and as I had said also that and there was a 2016 ruling Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that says you're not allowed to do that anymore you have to release the kids that's what leads to the parental separation I have also been saying that if Trump back down on this that if Trump said we're gonna reunify the families but keep them in custody immediately there would be a bunch of Democrats who signaled that this was unacceptable as well so separating families was like the Nazis and keeping families together in custody is also like the Nazis the only solution left of course is to release everybody into the general population and that's exactly what Democrats have been pushing for well one of the things that is truly maddening about this entire situation is the lack of intellectual honesty on virtually all sides on it but particularly from the left Tammy Baldwin is a senator from from I believe Wisconsin is the correct and in Tammy Baldwin was on CNN yesterday and she specifically asked about about whether she felt the same way when young migrant children were being imprisoned by Barack Obama Brooke Baldwin actually asked her a solid question on CNN so good for Brooke Baldwin watch Tammy Baldwin struggled to come up with an answer as to why she wasn't angry when Barack Obama was imprisoning children did you raise your voice under the Obama administration you know in numbers of cases usually I remember a constituent who was in detention at the border arguably very inappropriately and we you know we raised our voice in that instance and many others but that's we've got to do this now in unison it's not enough to do it case-by-case or senator or a House member by house member we've got to resolve to fix this issue okay so not to know okay that's a no I didn't care what Obama was president yes I do care when when Donald Trump is president the best evidence that the media seriously don't care about this issue until Trump is president comes today courtesy of The Associated Press so there's a story from The Associated Press here's the title young immigrants detained in Virginia censor allege abuse now you and imagine just from reading that title that the allegations of abuse are taking place because of stuff that is happening today right allegations of abuse that are happening today in the Shenandoah Valley juvenile center then it's all about trumped now this story mentions Donald Trump seven separate times in the course of this very long story from The Associated Press it mentions Barack Obama zero times in this very long story about abuses at detention centers of illegal immigrant miners and now there's only one problem all of the abuse is alleged in the story happened under Barack Obama's watch all of them happened in 2015 2016 that is buried in paragraph 19 of this story paragraph 19 so paragraph 19 they finally mentioned oh by the way all these illegal immigrant miners were abused and allegedly abused they're abused under Obama they mentioned that in paragraph 19 and they mentioned Donald Trump seven times in the mentioned Barack Obama by name zero times and then you wonder why when Donald Trump goes to his rallies and he shouts about fake news and people cheer and chant fake news you wonder why people take Donald Trump seriously when he says fake news because you bury the lead and then you don't report that Obama had anything to do with it and how bad were these abuses the answer is pretty damn bad here's the Associated Press immigrant children as young as 14 housed at a juvenile detention center in Virginia say they were beaten well handcuffed and locked up for long periods in solitary confinement left nude and shivering and concrete cells the abuse claims against the Shenandoah Valley juvenile Center near Stanton Virginia are detailed in federal court filings that include a half-dozen sworn statements from Latino G teens jailed there for months or years multiple detainees say the guards stripped them of their clothes and strapped them to chairs with bags placed over their heads whenever they used to restrain me and put me in the chair they would handcuff me said a Honduran immigrant who was sent to the facility when he was 15 strapped me down all the way from your feet all the way to your chest you couldn't really move total control over you they'll split a bag over your head it has little holes you can see through but you feel suffocated with the bag on in addition to the children's first hand translated accounts in court filings a former child development specialist who worked inside the facility independently told the AP this week she saw kids there with bruises and broken bones they blamed on guards she spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorised to publicly discuss the children's cases now normally when I lead a story and when I write a story I usually say on Wednesday or in 2015 the date is the first thing you say because it's sort of matters to the story you don't get any dates here until paragraph nineteen first you get this paragraph many of the children were sent there after US immigration authorities accused them of belonging to violent gangs including ms-13 President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited gang activity as justification for his crackdown on illegal immigration so that sounds like Donald Trump has been saying everybody's ms-13 so Isis out they're arresting a bunch of innocent kids throwing them in prison and torturing them because they say they're ms-13 right that's what you would get from that ap story and the AAP continues like this right Trump said Wednesday that our Border Patrol agents and our ice agents have done one great job cracking down on ms-13 measures an ms-13 gang members we're throwing them out by the thousands he said but a top manager at the shenandoah Center said during a recent congressional hearing that the children did not appear to be gang members and were suffering from mental health issues resulting from trauma that happened in their home country's problems the detention facility is ill-equipped to treat and then this is the best part okay so finally this is now in let's see paragraph 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 paragraph 10 ok paragraph 10 we finally get to a point here most children held in the Shannons own facility where the focus of the abuse lawsuit were caught crossing the border illegally alone they were not the children who have been separated from their families under the trump administration's recent policy and are now in the government's care okay so in other words this has nothing to do with the current issues that are being debated about family separation and then all the way down in paragraph 19 all the way down in paragraph 19 we get this the complaint filed by the nonprofit Washington lawyers Committee for civil rights and urban affairs recounts the story of an unnamed 17 year old Mexican citizen apprehended at the southern border the team fled an abusive father and violence fueled by drug cartels to seek asylum in the United States in 2015 let me recall when was the election of 2016 oh that's right it was after 2015 it turns out turns out 2016 after 2015 after stops at facilities in Texas in New York he was transferred to Shenandoah in April 2016 but wait Donald Trump wasn't president then right if I recall he was even the nominee for the Republicans at that point in April 2016 but you don't find that out until paragraph 20 of a 1000 word article and this article is not 1000 words an article probably 3,000 words okay I love this the lawyers for Shannon's all responded with court filings denying all wrongdoing information contained in a separate 2016 lawsuit appears to support some of the information contained in the recent abuse complaints wait a second there was a separate 2016 lawsuit meaning was publicly available in 2016 where is it now yeah it's 2018 what happened in the intervening two years did somebody was there a presidential change that's right Donald Trump became president and only then to the media start reporting on lawsuits alleging horrible abuses happening under Barack Obama I remember Obama's administration was scandal-free Barack Obama says so and that means that it's true we also know that there was an ACLU report in 2015 talking about detainee abuse is between 2009 and 2014 did you ever hear about that of course he didn't hear about that cuz nobody cared he's Barack Obama was president and Barack Obama was the bringer of light Barack Obama loved immigrants how do we know we know because he said so and the media said so here's the story another story like this was from the Drudge Report the tragic case of Roberto Aguilar Batista 38 whose family sued Barack Obama and multiple federal agencies after Batista died from complications of diabetes while being held in one of the administration's ill-equipped detention centers in a report published August 29 2014 CBS to Los Angeles says quote at a news conference Friday attended by CBS 2's Amy Johnson Nancy Munna said her husband had type 2 diabetes and his care was neglected he was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center among other places last March 2014 Roberto Aguilar Bautista died from complications of diabetes at the Dalbey Correctional Facility in other words there were lots and lots and lots of detainee abuses cocaine it was considered a detainee abuse to keep children together with their parents and yet the media are only interested in a crime Rachel Maddow is crying openly on-air about the separation of children from parents now in a second I'm going to show you why the Trump administration's response to this has been so foolish because the reality is Trump sure is stuck to his guns here listen we have a zero-tolerance policy you cross the border getting arrested and it is not up to me to change the law I cannot unilaterally change the law the job of the executive branch is to execute the law the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has already ruled that a settlement between the Clinton administration government 1997 and illegal immigrants in 1997 the Florida settlement 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rules that settlement means I cannot keep children together with parents but I am NOT going to release everybody into the interior of the country Trump should have maintained that line because that is the correct legal line instead President Trump decided that he was going to announce an executive order under pressure that's because the polling numbers were really not good on this stuff and the media attention on it obviously has been incredibly biased but here was president Trump yesterday announcing that that he was going to sign an executive order and then we'll go through the text of the executive order in just a second we want to keep families together it's very important I'll be signing something in a little while that's going to do that and the people in this room want to do that and they're working on various pieces of legislation to get it done but I thought be doing something that's somewhat preemptive but ultimately will be matched by the legislation I'm sure ok so he says that he's gonna sign an executive agreement now we had the executive order now I have the text of the executive order and all I can say is that it's either really stupid or it is really clever one of the two and I'll explain what I mean by that in just a second first I want to say thanks to our sponsors over at Boleyn branch so ok I am not good at sleeping as I have said many many times on this show but one of the things that allows me to sleep like a baby when I'm in my own house is my bowl and branch eat so Boleyn branch eats are just the best they really are terrific you don't think about the sheets that are on your bed you're probably still sleeping on the sheets that your parents gave you when you're 13 okay but if you don't want those sheets if you want something that's actually really nice Bowl and branch sheets will do it for you there are three ex presidents and Bill Clinton's lovers who sleep on these sheets they are just incredible there they don't worry about the thread count they are made of organic cotton okay thread count doesn't mean anything by the way I didn't even know that I always thought one of these guys who drives past the gas station like we have a five thousand thread count sheet over here and then you open it up in its natural plastic tarp well it's not the thread count that matters so much it's the actual quality of the sheet and these are made of pure organic cotton which means that they get softer with each washer they are just horrific we actually threw out all of our sheets after we started working with branch and got all brand-new sheets for us for our kids they're really terrific if you got these kinds of sheets at the store it would cost you upward of a thousand bucks but Poland brand sheets are only a couple of hundred dollars right now shipping is free you can try them for 30 nights as well so if you don't like them they don't have to pay for him right mean to get you started right now my listeners get 50 bucks off your first set of sheets at at ball and branch comm promo code Ben that's Bo LL and branch comm promo code Ben 50 bucks off your first set of sheets bull and branch comm promo club and there's a reason we love our Bolin branch eats they are awesome Bo ll and branch comm promo code men if you don't love them you send them back for a refund because you can try them for 30 days and shipping is free so go check them out right now you have nothing to lose Boleyn branch common promo club and you're definitely going to want to keep them you're not gonna want to shift them and ship them back okay so let's go through president Trump's executive order as I have said the Trump administration does not have the legal ability to keep children together with their parents in detention that is a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling based on the Obama administration's policy of keeping children together with parents in detention at the time this was considered inhumane I had folks on the Left suggested that it was inhumane to keep children in detention with their parents now they're suggesting it is inhumane to separate children from their parents in detention so here is what Trump actually put in the executive order the executive order is one of two things just as a preliminary note either it reinstates catch and release meaning that all of these parents have to be released into the general population or it does nothing but those are the only two choices this doesn't actually say that kids can now be kept with their parents in facilities instead what it basically says is to the fullest extent of law parents should be kept together with their kids it's kind of meaningless okay so here's what it says it says and by the authority vested in me as president of the United States and by the Constitution's of the and by the laws of the United States of America including the Immigration and Nationality Act it is hereby ordered as follows it is the policy of this administration to rigorously rigorously enforce our immigration laws under our laws the only legal way for an alien to enter this country is it is in a designated port of entry at an appropriate time when an alien enters or attempts to enter the country anywhere else that alien has committed at least the crime of improper entry and is subject to a fine or imprisonment under Section 1325 a of title 8 United States Code this administration will initiate proceedings to enforce this and other criminal provisions of the ia until and unless Congress directs otherwise it is also the policy of this administration to maintain family including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources it is unfortunate that Congress's failure to act and corers have put the administration in the position of separating alien families to effectively enforce the law okay so so far this has not said anything so far this is just reinstated the the Trump administration's policy which is we're going to arrest everybody and we'd like to keep the families together but we can't legally speaking okay then they get into the actual operative portion of this okay temporary detention policy for families entering the country illegally the Secretary of Homeland Security shall to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations maintain custody of alien families during the pendency of any criminally improper entry or immigration proceedings involving their members the Secretary shall not however detain an alien family together when there is a concern that detention of an alien family with the child's alien parent would pose a risk to the child's welfare the Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available means to provide for the secretary any existing facilities available for housing or carat of alien families now as you'll note the Secretary of Homeland Security shall to the extent permitted by law the law does not permit them to keep these kids together with their parents in the facilities that means that they're either going to have to release the parents or they don't have to separate the parents so they're nothing changed or everything changed okay this executive order doesn't actually do much nonetheless we're gonna talk about the media response to it because the media response to it is so bifurcated it's so crazy so let's talk a little bit about about the media response to this actually you know first let me point something out here's a chart on catch and release okay so catch and release is the policy that pre-existed Trump where instead of arresting everybody across the border illegally instead they would just arrest a bunch of people and then they would release them into the society and then they would hope that they showed back up in court for their day in court well in absentia rates for released aliens initial case completions fiscal year 2016 only 39% of people in 2016 who were arrested and then released 39% of them never showed up again so nearly 40% for intent frankly I'm shocked that that it's only four in said I'm shocked it's not seven in ten that's a huge number of people that means that there were there were nine thousand seven hundred and twenty-two in absentia orders that were declared in 2016 so there were almost 10,000 people who went missing basically in 2016 alone after they were arrested and then released into that's the reason why Trump wants to keep them in custody because the idea is if you release them they're just going to run away which is of course perfectly right well president Trump signs this executive order and as I say legally speaking because he cannot keep the families together he has two choices he can separate the families or he can release the entire family so either the executive order reinstate catch-and-release or the executive order does nothing and now my inclination is gonna be the executive order does a lot of nothing but it looks as that here's the problem with what Trump just did Trump is maintained for two weeks that he can't actually do anything by executive order and then he actually didn't do much by this executive order the executive order doesn't actually do anything so why did he do it and the answer is he didn't like the headline a president Trump has a bad habit of he gets himself into hot water and then all of the people around him stand up and defend what he's done right they defend at least the policy they say this is legally defensible and then President Trump doesn't like the blowback and then he mountain undercuts his own side by going and saying you know I'm gonna sign an executive order and fix all of this and well you can't sign this guy this executive or doesn't do anything right it is ineffective but it does hand a headline to the left which is Trump folded Trump cave so Stephen Colbert last night on his execrable show he said that president from folded by issuing this executive order make no mistake Trump folded he folded like an origami Trump casino this is the first time I have seen president Trump fold write this he's never done this before he folded for the first time so how did we get here okay and then he talks about we got here through public pressure we got here because you spoke out right Trump folded like a house of cheap cards right that's what he did here's the problem the same media that is saying that he folded so that you mean problem over right I mean if he folded then the problem is over except for that was never the agenda the actual agenda of the left is full release of anyone coming across the border there's a feeling on the left that ice itself is inappropriate that there is something deeply wrong with even arresting people at the border so Samantha be the least funny person in America she won that title a couple of weeks ago outright might've been in a running gun battle with Trevor Noah and Amy Schumer and Lena Dunham but she actually took the cake after her rant against Ivanka Trump she actually took the gold medal she ran away like like Secretariat was pretty amazing well now she comes forward she says listen Trump retreats on separating families and then he signs in order to detain them together but for Samantha B this is not enough why because she wants them all released into general society that's the whole point yay no more baby internment camps just regular internment camps cool that's what we call a win in 2018 to be clear I am happy that at least these kids are theoretically gonna stay with their parents but mommy and me jails are not a solution they're not new and they're also not legal man is she unfunny my goodness I mean being her audience most people be like being in a comedy internment camp my goodness that's just she's the worst Wow but the point that she's making is the point the Democrats were always going to make and I have been saying this for weeks for weeks for weeks for weeks not say I told you so but I period told period you period so I told you so Ike I told you that as soon as Trump said he's willing to hold the families together Democrats were immediately going to claim that something egregious had gone on something egregious was now going on we were back to the policy there obama embraced but that was bad enough all we want is full release oh yeah Bernie Sanders saying that's who here's Bernie Sanders saying that president Trump's executive order it did not go far enough it did not include putting funding for me and my friends and also I will not share my pudding with actual illegal immigrants but they will rant about it until I get my pudding from one of my aides so please talk Anderson Cooper to Bernie Sanders and then later Bernie Sanders will eat his pudding the idea of tearing little children from the arms of their parents putting them into detention cages and then making a big deal about an executive order which may do absolutely nothing there was a crisis that he created and attempted to address today but he didn't go anywhere near far enough okay the only way the Democrats are gonna feel that President Trump went far enough is if he does he on mass release rise that he gets an on mass release of all of these people and that of course is the whole point here right that's what the media is pushing for as well as for the media are pushing for here was Time magazine's new cover Time magazine has a brand new cover out and what exactly is their cover well it's this obnoxious thing so it's it's a cover of a crying child but supposedly being separate from the parents staring up at President Trump who is grinning down at the kid right because and then it says welcome to America Time magazine right I don't remember this sort of cover with Barack Obama and his giant camp full of children who are wrapped in aluminum foil but I am seeing this cover the whole point here is that no matter what from does he loses according to the media so if that's the case why not just enforce the law and then put it back on Congress well in just a second I'm going to explain to you why it is that the Democrats are pushing all of this and what they think that the policy actually should be but first I want to say thanks to our sponsors are over at Tommy John so let's let's talk a little bit let's talk a little bit about your underwear I know you feel like any inappropriate well too bad because let's be real your underwear are deeply uncomfortable not only are they uncomfortable they roll and they stick and they give you wedgies and all the rest of it well that is why Tommy John's lightweight breathable fabrics and wedgie-proof designs keep you cool and comfortable all summer long Tommy John is the most incredible fit you've ever experienced or it's on them they have a best pair you will ever wear or it's free guarantee and you're never going to have to worry again about being in uncomfortable sticky heat because of your underwear instead you've got these fantastic underwear from Tommy John they've revolutionary clothes okay they combine the latest in fabric technology with patented wedgie proof designs for a fit so perfect it's almost like wearing nothing at all and you'll never have to worry about swamp-like conditions down below down south because Tommy John's moisture wicking fabrics pull perspiration right off your body they're cool cotton fabrics rise four to five times faster and keeps you 2 to 3 times cooler than traditional Cotton's so that's pretty awesome and it's gonna be a hot summer so make sure that you get Tommy John and as I say all Tommy John underwear is back but their best pair you'll ever wear or it's free guarantee I wear Tommy John's all the time it protects me from wedgies that's my that's my chief concern ever since high school and so go to Tommy John comm slash Shapiro for 20% off your first order that's Tommy John comm slash apparel for 20% off again Tommy John comm slash appear you get 20% off and you're getting the best underwear on the planet so go to tommy chong kham slash spray let them know he's saying get 20% off ok so this has become very obvious the Democrats never cared about the policy of separation they never cared about it this was all a ruse the Democrats were fully concerned only and explicitly with destroying Donald Trump how do we know this number 1 Chuck Schumer refused the opportunity to put a legislative fix on this boo-boo I Ted Cruz wanted a legislative fix Chuck Schumer said no we're gonna put Trump's feet to the fire instead you cannot simultaneously argue that the policy is not yes and then turn down the opportunity to change the policy that's not how this works hello Stewie no well now Trump has supposedly changed the policy now as I explained I don't think the policy actually changed League speaking but supposedly Trump changed the policy and how do Democrats respond they respond by saying well good for president Trump's about time that we changed this or you know we pressured Trump into this good for us we finally did it we've won a big victory that is not how they responded how did they respond well they responded by saying we need more release everyone hears Kamala Harris his tweets Oh Kamala Harris my awful awful senator from the state of California she tweeted out this executive order doesn't fix the crisis indefinitely detaining children with their families and camps is inhumane and will not make us safe so again if you separate the kids from the families that's inhumane but if you keep the kids with the parents that's also inhumane so the only solution left by process of elimination is to release everyone which of course is the entire goal and by the way justifies everything Trump has been saying about Democrats don't like borders the Democrats just want illegal immigrants released into the general population that that actually is the priority if that's not their priority they need to propose a policy solution that allows us to arrest illegal immigrants who come in here with kids otherwise they're not providing us a policy solution they just want people released generally and then Eric's wall well is another Congress person another Democrat Congress person he comes for he says this Trump executive orders gonna lead to internment camps Democrat from California this could lead to Family internment camps wolf and that is what we do not want to see and the way to avoid that is to still follow that Flores decision which is a humane decision that does not want people in camps like this indefinitely okay this is my favorite part okay so my favorite part of this is that that was the policy okay the new Trump policy keeping these kids together with their parents that was the Trump policy the stated Trump policy up in the the Obama policy the government policy up till 2015-2016 hey Obama implemented that policy so luis Gutierrez who is a radical leftist friend from Illinois he was asked about this where he said well hold honestly hold up a second you know you're ripping on Trump now saying that he's gonna keep the families together that's what Obama did why didn't you complain about Obama on any of this here's Louise Gutierrez answering that question we did challenge Obama but you know what Obama had a heart he had a soul he had a heart he had a center he had convictions and we could speak to those okay so in other words we challenged him but really we massaged his asked really what our challenge was really mostly us getting the massage oils and just really going to work on President Obama that's it that's basically how we challenged him because he had a heart he had a soul I looked into his eyes and it was romantic we had that long lingering awkward moment before we kissed I mean it look really that was the way that you challenged Barack Obama whose policy was exactly the same as the current reinstated policy of Donald Trump the only difference between Trump's policy and Obama's policy is the Trump is doing it more often that is literally the only difference the only difference that Trump is actually attempting to strictly enforce border crossings he's using criminal court instead of civil convictions in order to enforce the border and Obama did that but not as much that's the only difference and yet we are told that Obama had a heart janna so how do we know he had a heart you got a soul because he had a DUI isn't it that's the real answer we had to die by his name and that means that he had a heart and he had a soul by the way the Democrats proposed legislation on border separation with let nearly all parents who commit federal crimes get off scot-free right gabriel malar has an entire column on this where he went through the senate democrat co-sponsored bill written carelessly it doesn't distinguish between migrant children at the border and US citizen children already within the united states the bill further does not distinguish between federal officers handling the border crisis and federal law enforcement pursuing the ordinary course of their duties the bill provides that an agent or officer of a designated agency shall be prohibited from removing a child from his or her parents or legal guardian at or near the port of entry or within 100 miles of the border of the United States okay well there this is a serious problem because if you can't remove the kids from the parents then you can't arrest the parents according to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals so their bill actually just releases all illegal immigrants who come across the board with kids but of course that's their entire policy now here's the hilarious part jeh Johnson who you'll recall was the Secretary of Homeland Security under Barack Obama the execrable DHS secretary under brocco bomb from 2013 to 2017 who presided over this Obama era policy you know the Obama era policy of keeping kids together with parents and detention centers he has an entire piece in The Washington Post virtually signaling so he did the exact same thing Trump is now saying that he's gonna do and he's a long piece in The Washington Post talking about what a good dude he is just like luis gutierrez says he has a soul he has a heart and it's really nice calves anyway here's what he says my wife and I spent Mother's Day in 2014 at a u.s. Border Patrol Center in McAllen Texas the facility had been built for single adults but it looked like a crude daycare center flooded with children in the midst of that flood my eyes were drawn to one little girl sitting alone at a desk and being processed by a Border Patrol agent I was struck by her long black hair which was beautiful despite the hot and dirty journey from Central America she had just completed I asked her why did you come here she replied I'm looking for my mother in the United States she began to try cry the translator began to cry I began to cry yeah really there's what he's writing okay this is the guy who's responsible for actual families being held in detention centers in 2014-2015 and who said openly that this is a deterrent policy designed to keep little girls with beautiful black hair from journeying from Central America he says as I witnessed the Trump administration's current practice of separating children from their parents at the border with Mexico the image of that little girl and hundreds of other migrant women and children is fixed in my mind not the not the images of those kids who you are keeping in detention centers you know Jay Johnson the images of course that have to do with Trump now here's the whole point here Democrats don't actually have to act sympathetically all they have to do is is act as though they are sympathetic they don't actually have to pursue policies that are sympathetic to American citizens they don't have to pursue good legal policies all they have to do is talk about how much they cry and we're all supposed to pretend that means that they have the best of intentions he says I hesitate to criticize my successors in office who are burdened with the responsibility of keeping the u.s. homeland and its border secure I hesitate to cast doubt on the hard work of those who once worked for me in the DHS yeah he hesitates in the pages of the Washington Post but when it comes to certain offensive and wrongheaded government policies those of us with a public voice and who understand the issue cannot stay silent so what exactly is a problem with a policy according to Jay Johnson he says he doesn't like the zero-tolerance deterrence policy he doesn't like that everybody who's coming across the border illegally is arrested now he doesn't have anything to say about the actual separation policy because he engaged in it it doesn't actually have anything to say about keeping families together because he engaged in it instead he just says that we should get rid of the zero-tolerance policy which essentially means that we should release all of these people into the center of the United States he says the answer to the underlying problem is twofold first send more aid to Central America in 2016 Congress started down this road by appropriating 750 million bucks and assistance from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador in subsequent years that level of support has fallen off so we're supposed to pay off these countries second encouraged the neighboring countries in the region Mexico Panama Costa Rica Belize to develop their own systems for accepting Central and refugees and asylum-seekers okay this is the hilarious part so his two solutions don't involve separation or keeping kids together with their parents the only solutions he's actually suggesting jeh Johnson the former DHS secretary under kind caring generous Barack Obama is cut a check to Honduras and try to ask the Mexicans to take care of the problem those were really his only two solutions that's it nothing about parental separation nothing about keeping kids together with their parents all of which suggests this is just politically driven crap it's just politically driven nonsense which of course it is I mean that's that's all this is it's just deliver deliberately stupid it's it's it's so irritating to watch as the media falls prey to this and they're doing it on purpose I'm gonna give

about the NBA we talked about the intersection of culture and politics it was great and you're gonna wanna listen to it so check that out we are the largest fastest growing conservative podcast in the nation already said the stupidest of all possible responses to this this whole border scenario which feels ginned up it's not to say that there's not a problem with the policy there is a problem with the policy there has been a problem with the policy there will continue to be a problem with the policy until Congress does something about it Congress is not going to do anything about it because Democrats are far more interested in yelling and screaming and doing stompy foot than they aren't actually solving things the proof of this comes courtesy of Joe Kennedy the third so nothing I like better than a guy who's only famous because he had a grandpa who was president that's that that's my favorite thing as you know I'm a big into the nepotism I just I love it and Joe Kennedy the third a man who dumped his face into a vat of chapstick before speaking in his response to the State of the Union address is now tweeting we're supposed to take him seriously because his grandpa was President of the United States and also banged around a lot here's a representative Joe Kennedy the thirty said you might not know this about me but I'm a white guy now he knew dude he says as a white guy I would encourage Donald Trump and his fellow GOP white guys to consult a not white guy in their efforts to enact comprehensive immigration reform in less than 24 hours oh my god it's worth noting here that 50 percent of all I NS agents fifty percent of all ice agents are Hispanic are non-white so it might be worth noting that so if you consult the people over at ice my guess is that they have some ideas but they might not actually agree with Joe Kennedy I love the assumption that all black people in brown people agree with Joe Kennedy on his preferred policy of releasing all illegal immigrants into the United States on mass it's really just because of a whiteness it's just because of toxic whiteness I'm surprised I'm gone with that yet we've got we've got white supremacy we've got white we have white power we have all these terms of art I'm surprised I'm gonna toxic whiteness right our whiteness is making us toxic yeah I love that Joe Kennedy a white man is lecturing other people on all this stuff you know I'm less white than Joe Kennedy presumably because it depends I'm Jewish so I guess that Jewish is less white maybe hmm it depends okay so he then he tweeted out might be my cautious side but it seems like there could be unforeseen consequences like entire families being indefinitely locked in cages just my two cents again the Democrats are unified in their approach here they're going to bash from for separating families and then they're going to bash them for bringing families back together they don't want anyone arrested they want everyone released into the interior of the United States this is their end goal it's really it's astonishing that they're this clear about and that the media seem not to care at all but you know shocker that's that's what the media do now meanwhile this is this is an amazing amazing story about the ACLU it turns out that the ACLU is now about to change its policies for a long time the ACLU was a free speech organization right they're the kind of people who would defend Nazis marching in Skokie where they famously defended a Nazi march in Skokie because the idea was that they they had to they it was deeply important that they defend the free speech rights of people whom they disagree and for that I give the ACLU credit well now there's an internal memo from the American Civil Liberties Union and they say that they're going to weigh their interest in protecting the First Amendment against other commitments to social justice racial equality and women's rights given the possibility of the defensive speech might undermine ACLU goals in other words the ACLU which was supposed to be the premier of civil liberties union in the United States is now changing its policy they're going to balance free speech concerns like you should be able to say what you want in the United States of America like the First Amendment they're going to balance that with does it offend black people that's really what this is well does it does it offend LGBT people so in other words if for example the state of California cracks down on this show because that broadcast from the state of California and I say that a man is a man and a woman is a woman and you can't magically change from one to the other if the state of California were to crack down on me and attempt to find me and I went to the ACLU and I said listen guys you may disagree with me but this is a basic First Amendment issue the ACLU you would have 20 years ago defended me now the ACLU says listen we may agree with you on First Amendment grounds but that's really offensive to transgender people so we're not going to defend you anymore so here is the confidential memo obtained by a former board member it's amazing they say our defensive speech may have a greater or lesser harmful impact on the equality and justice work to which we are also committed so they're now going to do a balancing act and they're now going to do a balancing act they say the ACLU is a premier defender of the Bill of Rights and works on multiple civil liberties and civil rights issues using an integrated advocacy approach that includes litigation communications grassroots activism and policy advocacy our position in one area can sometimes present a conflict with our work and goals in another area well no it shouldn't because you're talking about government policy right when you're talking about government policy you're dislike of a particular Nazi statement does not mean that you think that the government should be able to ban that Nazi statement two things can be true ones I hate Nazis I also think Nazis have rights in the United States of America hey bottom line free speech applies to people with whom I disagree and then their internal memo says work to protect free speech may raise tensions with racial justice reproductive freedom or a myriad of other rights where the contents of the speech we seek to protect conflicts with our policies on those matters and/or otherwise is directed at menacing vulnerable groups for individuals at the same time work to advance equality may create tensions with speech and religious liberty privacy safeguards may create tensions with protections for women in the domestic sphere as a multi-issue organization these conflicts are inevitable we cannot eliminate them but we can ensure that we consider them carefully and thoroughly why is this coming up they say the ACLU is involvement in the protests and subsequent tragedy in Charlottesville Virginia in August 2017 brought these issues to the fore once again and prompted these guidelines first proposed on the nationwide called the ACL u 's affiliate legal directors these guidelines are designed to assist in consideration of the competing interests that may arise when such conflicts arise in other words they defended the right of the Charlottesville protesters who were white supremacists to to do the rally and then they didn't like what emerge and now they don't want to defend those rights anymore hey this is the death of the First Amendment this is the end of the First Amendment so this is a full this is a full surrender to the forces of intersectionality so in The Wall Street Journal this former board member talks about this entire situation the former board member who revealed this memo was a person named Wendy kam and I'm gonna go through her op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in just saying so here's what she says what she says is the furthest speech case guidelines reflected to motion of free speech in the ACLU hierarchy of values they're vague references to the serious harm to marginalize people occasion by speech can easily include the presumed psychological effects of racist or otherwise hateful hateful speech which is constitutionally protected but contrary to ACLU values faced with perceived conflicts between freedom of speech and progress toward equality the ACLU is likely to choose equality if the Supreme Court adopted the ACL u 's balancing test it would greatly expand government power to restrict restrict speech and this is exactly right of course this is why there are a lot of folks on the right whore deeply concerned that all of the hate speech legislation that you see in Canada is going to come to the United States forthwith that very soon what you're going to see is legislation pursued by Democrats and upheld by courts that says that you cannot say things that offend other people and if you offend other people then you will be fully responsible in a court of law for offending other people the end of the First Amendment is at hand and what we are watching right now is deeply scary and deeply troubling and the fact the ACLU is caving to it is demonstrative of the collapse of liberalism into leftism I've always said there's a difference between people who are liberal and people who are of the left people who are liberal are people who may disagree with me on policies like the amount of government involvement in the economy but they believe I have a right to speak they believe that I have a right to live my life as I see fit for the most part with certain government regulations that would restrict interactions between people in the business sphere right or they believed in redistribute of economics but they believe that I should be able to talk as I see fit leftist by contrast believe that my very speech is a threat to their safety it's a it's a it's a destruction of the it's a it's a a bolstering of institutions of privilege and therefore my speech has to be shut down well leftists are the people who are protesting me on campus leftists are the ones who are protesting me liberals are the ones were debating me leftists are the ones who are protesting me and asking that I be shut down on campus these leftists used to be at odds with the ACLU the ACLU used to say people on the Left we're trying to shut down free speech these are part of the problem these are the bad guys but instead they've decided that they are going to collapse a full scale into the foolishness of the of the hard left and now they are going to give up on free speech entirely and instead they're going to just jump full-scale into a into an embrace of intersectional politics in which race and gender matter a lot more than basic principles like freedom of speech now with all that said you wonder why Trump is drawing big numbers of rallies it's because of stuff like this there's because the ACLU is because media malfeasance so Trump yesterday was in northern Minnesota Minnesota went very narrowly for Hillary Clinton in the last election cycle she only won it by I think it was under two percent and so Trump actually has some momentum in Minnesota and he is not wrong when he says the Democrats are putting illegal immigrants before American citizens he I can't say that he's wrong when he says this when Democrats are openly saying that all illegal immigrants who cross the border with kids should be released into the center of the country Emma Kratz put illegal immigrants before they put American citizens what the hell is going on okay so I can't argue with him I'd like to say that he's wrong but I'm having a problem saying that he's wrong when I went again Democrats were making very clear that this is how they feel about this stuff and by the way the media malfeasance continues full-scale here's President Trump yesterday saying that he wanted to send ms-13 back he said that it was we it was necessary to send ms-13 back and ABC News said that he said all illegal immigrants including children we have ms-13 gangs we have taken them out of our country by the thousands they're not sending their finest that I can tell you and we're sending him to hell back he's specifically talking about ms-13 ABC News headlined that he was talking about all illegal immigrants I love it I love it it's just it's just spectacular so this is you wonder why President Trump continues to gain momentum it's because the left cannot just make factual critiques of President Trump they gin up false narratives and use them against him and then they use those false narratives in order to push liberal organizations like the ACLU into hard left ISM by saying the priority here has to be fighting the bad guy and the bad guy is the hit Larry and Trump and if we can fight Trump if we can fight the hit Larry and right by violating First Amendment principles by violating the Constitution well then we will have made the world a much much better place the left's the left's drive for utopia means that they're going to run roughshod over your rights and this is driving people to worry in a reactionary support of anyone who promises to be anti left that's what's happening in the country right now and that's a dangerous phenomena because now we have reactionary politics on both sides and very little principle the opposition to specific violations of Liberty okay time for some things I like and then some things that I hate so things I like well I think we need some real acting music after all this because we never frustrating day so Dvorak spano quintet number two so Dvorak as a Czech composer and he lived about the time of Brahms Brahms was a big fan of Dvorak uu if you know divorce likes music it's because you have heard his music from the New World Symphony the New World Symphony was written when he traveled through the United States is his ninth symphony I believe I and the new world is is used very frequently in film particularly the second movement of the New World Symphony which is used in clear and present danger they use it at military funerals sometimes but the but this is his piano quintet I'm very into the piano quintet as a form so there there are lots of different forms of chamber music a piano quintet is is quite wonderful because instead of a full booming sound of the orchestra kennel quintet is two violins violas cellist and pianist and so you get a wide variety of sound in sort of the minimal number of people I here's the beginning of foreshocks quintet in a major opus 81 okay I think we've relaxed enough so that's that's good stuff from from Dvorak go check that out this is also great writing music okay it's great writing and great studying music chamber music is great for that and it's a hell of a lot better than eight bleep okay I mean like that that terrible new Beyonce song first of all kudos to the multiple people who have now taken my lyric read of eight bleep and put it on YouTube to the actual soundtrack from eight poop by Beyonce and jay-z kudos to you you have made great art apparently my version first of all you've never heard me Spitfire is that how we say it Spitfire okay we've never heard any Spitfire but if I chose to do so let me tell you I would wrap like cardi B okay maybe whose cardi B I don't know anyway okay time for a thing I hate okay so this is a great piece from Jessie Daniels and opinion columnist for The Huffington Post so you know this is gonna be awesome right it's from the Huffington Post alright so you just know it's gonna be great here is the piece the piece is titled why the face of family separation is a white woman Wow the face of family separation is a white woman again it's race that drives family separation because you see white people are the worst they're just the worst who's writing this why a white lady indeed but here's what she writes when President Donald Trump referred to some immigrants as animals homeland security secretary Christian Nielsen was quick to defend him if anyone wants to quibble about whether or not we should call those people animals perhaps the quibble should be whether we call them something worse well again he was talking about ms-13 people whose literal slogan is what does it shoot rape kill is some something like that it's insane and now Nielsen is leaning into enforcing the zero-tolerance policy of separating children from their families at the border that's not the zero tolerance policy the zero tolerance policy is arresting everyone crosses the border the separation is a necessary legal byproduct of the arrest a family separation has been portrayed as a women's issue in the media with all four former first living first ladies opposing it the administration has deployed Nielson along with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders too defended both women appeared in a press briefing on Monday and performed that job gussto white women like Nilsson and Sanders have always been part of making white supremacy seem more palatable unless like the brutal repressive ideology it is historical examples abound from white women who worked alongside male colonizers to the wives of slaveholders who punished the people their husbands owned to the white women who packed the picnic lunches for and took the photos of the lynching purportedly committed in their defense white women have played active roles in advancing and protecting white supremacy and then she says their counterparts today are women like Laura Ingraham Ann Coulter right Laura Norman Ann Coulter are both women who I'm sure would have involved themselves in lynching of black people for no reason and taking pictures of it I just I love the idea that race and sex defined the evil and the woman who's writing is of that race and sex but this is the the point of intersectionality intersectionality is the suggestion that we can define you purely by the various groups to which you belong unless you do penance unless you come forward and achieve the grace of the left by claiming that you have moved beyond your own parochial interests as a white woman writing for the Huffington Post now you have given up all of your own opinions and you have embraced the collective because you no longer an individual obviously you've moved beyond your whiteness and your womanís and instead you are going to say exactly what the left wants you to say and this sort of silliness obviously leads the country become a much worse place Bridget Christian Nielsen and and Sarah Huckabee Sanders are not doing what they're doing because they're white women they're doing what they are doing because they are conservatives and work for the Trump administration and that is why they're doing what they're doing end of story but I guess if we're gonna reduce everybody down to racial categories you can't be particularly surprised when the country tears itself apart okay we will be back here tomorrow with all the latest plus the mailbag cuz tomorrow's a Friday Wow we've made it to the end of the week almost we're almost there guys see you here then I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show the Ben Shapiro show is
