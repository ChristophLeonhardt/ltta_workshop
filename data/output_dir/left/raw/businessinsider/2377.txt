book about Warren Buffett called the

snowball startled a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,270
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago by writing a</font>

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,740
bloomberg news column in which it seemed

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,619
to me you were saying that most people

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,090
who do well and make a living<font color="#CCCCCC"> on Wall</font>

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,220
Street have to cheat to do that is that

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,289
exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were saying yeah what I</font>

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:33,660
said is it's hard to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a legal living</font>

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,730
on Wall Street not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't in</font>

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,739
fact I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said there are a lot of honest</font>

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,829
hard-working people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't cheat but</font>

15
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,750
rather than it's an impediment if you

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,789
don't because the system stacked in

17
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,039
favor of those who do well let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,329
with the honest side so you worked on

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,440
Wall Street for a long time yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
endlessly successful yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you cheat</font>

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,520
no but I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> under constant pressure to</font>

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,789
give the first call to important clients

23
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,890
to give some indication about what my

24
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,079
conviction was on a rating frankly

25
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:03,149
that's cheating and you know I did do

26
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,739
that of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if you did that we all</font>

27
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,630
did that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time you tell an</font>

28
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,189
institutional investor how strong your

29
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:09,720
conviction is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rating that's</font>

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,020
cheating in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fashion it mean to me it's</font>

31
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,240
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ludicrousness of this idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a level playing field right and the</font>

33
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,509
fact that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend an hour with a CEO</font>

34
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,490
and you ask them a question any wheezes

35
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,740
doesn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an SEC filing but boy</font>

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,060
does it tell you a boatload of

37
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,700
information so I to me it's the

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,080
ludicrousness of the idea that it's

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,270
perfectly level and there but I mean

40
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,909
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's cheating that's a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low</font>

41
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,500
level if that's what cheating is I mean

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,360
so so what you're saying you know the

43
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,939
whole Raj galley and insider trading

44
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you feel like that's rampant no no</font>

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,500
and part of what i wrote was a criticism

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,450
of the fallacy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the level playing</font>

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,280
field because small investors are

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,950
totally treated differently and unfairly

49
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,049
compared to big investors but it's pay

50
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,200
for play and the laws tend to behave as

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,000
though that economic reality shouldn't

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,409
exist and they get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more that</font>

53
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,210
way all the time and you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

54
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,159
can't have a system where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to</font>

55
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,439
criminalize economically rational

56
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,420
behavior but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting harder and</font>

57
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,758
harder to follow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules so that's</font>

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,520
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote it's you know and it is</font>

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">true that small investors are</font>

60
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,480
out on a level playing field absolutely

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
not to me that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important</font>

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,890
point is that it's just crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yet</font>

63
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,480
every day it seems like we try to

64
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,129
maintain this fiction that that's the

65
00:02:22,129 --> 00:02:24,170
case exactly we both worked there for a

66
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,340
long time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably</font>

67
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,680
the most harmful lesson that small

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,239
investors are hit with every day oh

69
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:31,099
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it'll</font>

70
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">be 11 playing fields crazy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

71
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,459
besieged<font color="#CCCCCC"> by emails from financial</font>

72
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">advisors who are in just torment over</font>

73
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:38,930
this issue after<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote this meaning</font>

74
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,450
what you know they feel that they cannot

75
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,799
serve their clients they're under

76
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">pressure from their firms to sell</font>

77
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,950
products that are inappropriate or just

78
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,959
for fees they know that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

79
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,760
getting the right you know the same

80
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,560
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of service from their firms and</font>

81
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,610
they feel conflicted so given that the

82
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,959
pressure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that there's no</font>

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,880
level playing field and so forth what

84
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,489
should small investors do you know I

85
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,590
there's not a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer other than</font>

86
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,120
for one thing don't think that you can

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
pick stocks that beat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market make</font>

88
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,980
sure you minimize fees and understand

89
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,360
how the other guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting paid to look</font>

90
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,549
for index funds you know those are those

91
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:16,190
are things I can do and and you know for

92
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,260
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've got a rap account and</font>

93
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,030
you're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in cash and you're</font>

94
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,560
earning a half a percent on the cash

95
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,329
don't be paying a one-percent rap free

96
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,850
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your advisor simple things that's</font>

97
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,500
right and on the index funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

98
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,600
opponents of index funds will always say

99
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,340
oven it's just boring it's the pursuit

100
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,980
of mediocrity oh you've been again a

101
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wall Street</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long long time and yet</font>

102
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,859
you're saying this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the smart way to</font>

103
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:40,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">go yeah I mean I'm not a big fan of just</font>

104
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,980
sort of mindless indexing and dollar

105
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,630
cost averaging because when the market

106
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,609
is overvalued I think you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell</font>

107
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:48,889
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think mindless dollar cost</font>

108
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:52,069
averaging is can be very bad but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

109
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:54,319
same time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> small investors are</font>

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,209
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to beat the market they're not</font>

111
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,130
most professionals don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the ones</font>

112
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,810
who are cheating that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right that's</font>

113
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,280
right and that's why the incidence of

114
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,019
cheat so high there's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough alpha</font>

115
00:04:03,019 --> 00:00:00,000
thanks
