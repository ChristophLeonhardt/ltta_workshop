“I know words.
I have the best words."
“When did that hit you?
The magnitude of the office?"
“It’s the bigness
of the office.
It’s the bigness of
the transactions.
It’s the bigness
of the deals."
“Big people from
big companies.
In one case — I won’t say who.
Somebody you know
very well, the head
of a major, major company — 
and I said, come on,
I’ll bring you to
the Oval Office.
The person came into the Oval
Office and started to cry."
“This is a tough
person, by the way.
Came into the Oval Office
and started to cry."
“This is enough.
Thank you.
Thank you, very much."
