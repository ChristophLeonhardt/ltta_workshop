IT WASN'T ANOTHER ADMINISTRATION. IT WAS THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT CLOSED IT. MY NEXT GUEST SENATOR MARCO RUBIO HARSHLY WENT AFTER THE PRESIDENT, SAYING ON TWITTER, IF THIS IS TRUE THEN ADMINISTRATION HAS SURRENDERED TO CHINA ON ZTE, MAKING CHANGES TO THEIR BOARD, AND A FINE WON'T STOP THEM FROM STEALING FROM UNITED STATES, BUT THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO BE OVER. WE WILL BEGIN WORKING ON VETO-PROOF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION. I JUST HEARD THE PRESIDENT SPEAKING. IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE'RE GOING, THAT'S GOOD NEWS. I'M GOING OFF THE NEWS REPORTS SAYING SOME IN HIS COMINGS ADMINISTRATION ARE PUSHING FOR A BIG DEAL. IT SHOULDN'T BE MIXED. WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH CHINA. THEY FORCE OUR COMPANIES TO TURN OVER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES, SECRETS. YOU CAN'T DO BUSINESS IN CHINA UNLESS YOU DO THAT. MEANWHILE THEIR COMPANIES CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT HERE. THAT HAS TO BE FIXED, BECAUSE IT'S LONG TERM AND PROBLEMATIC. ZTE IS A CELLPHONE AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. THEY GOT CAUGHT INVOLVING THE IRAN DEAL, THE SANCTION IN NORTH KOREA. THEY GOT HIT WITH A BILLION DOLLAR FINE, AND WERE TOLD THEY HAD TO FIRE THE EMPLOYEES WHO DID THAT. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID? THEY LIED. THEY DIDN'T FIRE THE EMPLOYEES. THEY GAVE THEM A BONUS, AND TRIED TO COVER THAT UP AS WELL, LIKE THEY TRIED TO COVER UP THE VIOLATIONS. FINE, YOU CAN'T BUY OUR SEMICONDUCTORS, AND THAT PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT'S WHAT WEE NEED TO BE DOING WHEN THEY VIOLATE THESE THINGS. OTHERS SAY LET'S FINE THEM AGAIN, FIRE THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THAT ONCE. YOU USE THOSE PHONES, THEY CAN STEAL OUR SECRETS, SPY ON US. THEY EVEN HAVE SUBCONTRACTORS IN ZTE PEOPLE COULD BE USING HUAWEI TECHNOLOGY OR SOMETHING AND NOT KNOW IT. IN YOUR MIND, IS THERE NO NEGOTIATION TO ALLOW ZTE TO SURVIVE? THEY TOLD THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION THEY'RE GOING TO GO BANKRUPT. THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND WE NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT. IS THERE ANY WAY YOU'D BE COMFORTABLE DEALING WITH ZTE EVER? FIRST OF ALL, WHAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN COMPANIES LIKE THE CHINESE HAVE BANKRUPTED, LIKE THE AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT PARTNER WITH THE CHINESE COMPANIES. THE CHINESE STEAL EVERYTHING YOU DO. ONCE THEY FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO, WE DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE, WE'LL DO IT CHEAPER, BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIZES US, AND YOU'RE OUT OF BUSINESS. NUMBER TWO, WE DIDN'T PUT THEM OUT OF BUSINESS, WE JUST SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO SELL THEM AMERICAN SEMI CONDUCT AMERICAN SEMICCONDUCT AMERICAN SEMICONNDUCT AMERICAN SEMICONDUUCT AMERICAN SEMICONDUCTT AMERICAN SEMICONDUCTORS. I DON'T FEEL ABOUT THAT. I DON'T WORK FOR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. I UNDERSTAND, BUT YOU LOOK AT IT THE WAY YOU LOOK AT IT, WHICH I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND, THE WAY WE'VE DONE THIS FOR A LONG TIME. THE PRESIDENT IS LINKING A LOT OF THINGS THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING LINKED. RIGHT. THIS IS DEFINITELY THE WAY THAT THE TRUMP FOREIGN POLICY DOCTRINE, IF YOU WILL, IS EMERGING. HE'S SAYING, LOOK, I WANT THEM TO HELP US WITH NORTH KOREA. I WANT TO LOWER THE TRADE DEFICIT WITH THE CHINESE. I WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO IT. THEY SAID TO THE ADMINISTRATION, IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER, LOOK, GIVE US SLACK ON ZTE, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BUY A LOT MORE AMERICAN GOODS AND HELP YOU WITH THE NORTH KOREA SITUATION. YEAH. YOU SAID SOMETHING I DISAGREE WITH. THIS IS NOT THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT. THE WAY WE'VE ALWAYS DONE IT THE WAY THEY'RE GOING NOW. THAT IS THE CHINESE GO TO A BUNCH OF AMERICAN COMPANIES, A SEMI CONDUCTOR COOR SEMI CONDUCTOR COMR SEMI CONDUCTOR COMPANY AND SAY CAN YOU GO TO CONGRESS AND LOBBY THEM TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS? THEN THEY BACK OFF. THAT'S WHY THEY'VE GAINED AN ADVANTAGE US. NORTH KOREA IS IN CHINA'S INTERESTS. IF NORTH KOREA AND KIM JONG-UN GOES DOWN, A BUNCH OF NORTH KOREANS WILL COME ACROSS THE BORDER. THEY'RE NOT DOING US ANY FAVOR HELPING US WITH NORTH KOREA. THEY'RE CLOSER TO THAT CRAZY GUY THAN WE ARE. THEY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT IT. NUMBER THREE, WHAT KIND OF DEAL IS IT WHERE THEY SAY WE'LL BUY MORE AGRICULTURE FROM AMERICA, AND IN RETURN WE'RE GOING TO KEEP STEALING YOUR STUFF. IN ABOUT FIVE OR EIGHT YEARS, THEY'LL DOMINATE BIOTECH, AEROSPACE, BE ABLE TO LISTEN IN TO OUR MILITARY SECRETS, USE THOSE. I MEAN, THEY ARE BUILDING AIRPLANES OUR AIRPLANES THAT TOOK US 20 YEARS TO INNOVATE, THESE GUYS ARE COMING UP WITH THESE THINGS IN TWO YEARS. THEY'RE EITHER THAT BRILLIANT, WHICH THEY'RE NOT, OR THEY'RE STEALING IT FROM US. HERE'S MY QUESTION FOR YOU. IS CHINA JUST AN ENEMY? IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DEAL WITH THEM ON? WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING ON DISPUTED ISLAND, THEIR ECONOMIC GROWTH, THEIR GROWTH RATE, THEY WANT TO SURPASS US BY 2028. RIGHT. ARE THERE DEALS THAT COULD BE DONE OR SHOULD WE TREAT THEM IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY AND SAY OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS ARE OUT FOR YOURSELVES, WE'RE OUT FOR OURSELVES, AND THAT'S IT? RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN IMBALANCE. WHEN YOU HAVE AN IMBALANCE, THE OTHER PLACE WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU. YOU HAVE WARS OVER IMAMBULANCE. CHINESE COMPANIES CAN DO WHATEVER. AMERICAN COMPANIES AROUND ALLOWED INTO CHINA, AND IF THEY ARE IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE PARTNERED WITH CHINESE COMPANIES, AND THEN THEY STEAL FROM YOU. FOR 20 YEARS, AMERICAN PRESIDENTS, BEFORE THIS ONE, MADE THE DECISION, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ONCE THEY'RE RICH, THEY'RE GOING TO ACT MORE LIKE US. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY. NOW THEY'VE FINALLY REALIZED, AND IT'S ALMOST TOO LATE. WE'RE TURNING THEM INTO AN ENEMY, BY THIS IMBALANCE. UNTIL WE GET THIS THING BALANCED OUT STRUCTURALLY, THE THREAT OF
