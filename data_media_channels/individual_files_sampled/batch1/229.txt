the US president Donald Trump hasn't been seen in public since Friday the day thirteen Russian citizens and three companies were indicted for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign and for allegedly trying to throw the election Trump's way on Sunday the president took to Twitter to blame everyone from Hillary Clinton to the media for the suggestion that his campaign colluded with the Russian government to win the election something he has always denied I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400-pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer the Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia it never did the independent senator Bernie Sanders allegedly was also being supported by the Russian operation but he said on Sunday the bigger problem is how Trump is reacting but the real issue right now is how do we have a President of the United States not saying what everybody knows to be true Russia interfered in 2:16 they're going to interfere in 2018 and we have got to do everything we can to make sure that they do not undermine American democracy meanwhile a senior Democratic senator said the indictment should alarm Americans it's not yet clear whether the Russians succeeded in actually changing votes what's clear is that they spent millions and millions of dollars and had hundreds of people working in a troll farm in st. Petersburg to intentionally undermine one candidate Hillary Clinton and support another Donald Trump on Saturday night Trump also criticized his national security adviser HR McMaster for not backing his view of the situation McMaster had told delegates at the Munich Security Conference that the indictment was proof of Russian interference in u.s. political affairs general McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only collusion was between Russia and crooked H the DNC and the Dems remember the dirty dossier rhenium speeches emails and the Podesta company that tweet now has the DC chattering class wondering whether McMasters job is in jeopardy given the president's predilection for driving out those who don't parrot his view of the world Rosalind Jordan al-jazeera Washington
