Not for a charcoal grill,
no charcoal grills are allowed
You’re scared.
Please leave me alone.
You're white.
African-American
Illegally selling water
without a permit.
But with cellphone cameras and
social media calling 911
on your black or
brown neighbors just
isn’t what it used to be.
Hi, I’m Niecy Nash, actress,
inventor and advocate
for not calling 911 on black people
for no goddamn reason.
I’d like to introduce you to
a radical new product
that will save you all the
headaches of being filmed
and outed as a racist douche.
It’s called 1-844-WYT-FEAR
and it's revolutionizing the way
racist white people
cope with black people
living life near them.
1-844-WYT-FEAR?
There’s a black guy
outside my neighbor’s house
and he’s walking around.
Our experienced staff
have been living
while black in America
their entire lives.
Darren, here, is a
former Obama aide
who had the cops called
on him for moving
into his new apartment.
That is actually
your neighbor Michael.
Yeah, no problem.
Our records are
actually showing
that's actually his boat.
Yeah, I know.
black people have
boats too, now.
Studies show that
people of color
are more likely to be arrested,
convicted, and serve longer
sentences than white
people for similar crimes.
So calling 911 for
non-emergency situations
is really just a  move.
I got so scared when
I saw a black guy
walking around outside.
And so I called
1-844-WYT-FEAR.
And it turns out
we’re neighbors.
And I'm a racist.
Now black people have
been helping white people
be better since,
always.
So she’s looking around
and standing there?
Regular Frisbee or Ultimate Frisbee?
Call it when black people are:
1-844-WYT-FEAR
It’s a real number
for real white people
who should mind
their own damn business.
What's going on here?
