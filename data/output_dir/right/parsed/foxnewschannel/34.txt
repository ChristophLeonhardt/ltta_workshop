WHAT DO YOU HAVE?
>> GOOD MORNING.
CLEARLY THE WHITE HOUSE IS
WATCHING ALL OF THIS WITH KEEN
INTEREST.
FIRST OF ALL JUST WANT TO
CLARIFY THAT THERE WERE REPORTS
THE MORNING THAT A SUSPICIOUS
PACKAGE HAD BEEN FOUND
ADDRESSED TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
THAT, IN FACT, I'M TOLD, BY THE
U.S. SECRET SERVICE IS NOT THE
CASE.
THEY HAD PACKAGES THAT WERE
ADDRESSED TO THE CLINTONS FOUND
IN WEST CHESTER COUNTY AND A
PACKAGE THAT WAS FOUND AT A
MAIL SORTING FACILITY IN AN
OFF-CAMPUS MAIL SORTING
FACILITY ADDRESSED TO PRESIDENT
OBAMA.
ALL FORMER PRESIDENTS' MAIL IS
SCREENED WHETHER IT'S OBAMA,
BUSH, CARTER, BILL CLINTON.
ALL THEIR MAIL IS SCREENED AWAY
FROM THEIR HOMES.
THE SUSPICIOUS PACKAGE THAT WAS
SENT TO THE HOME OF GEORGE
SOROS ACTUALLY DID MAKE IT INTO
HIS MAILBOX.
THAT MAILBOX IS AWAY FROM THE
HOME AND PART OF A BIG COMPOUND
HE HAS NORTH OF THE CITY.
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS WITH A
STATEMENT WE CONDEMN THE
ATTEMPTED VIOLENT ATTACKS MADE
AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA,
PRESIDENT CLINTON, SECRETARY
CLINTON AND OTHER PUBLIC
FIGURES.
THE THEY AREIZING ACTS ARE
DESPICABLE AND ANYONE
RESPONSIBLE WILL BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE LAW.
WE'RE INVESTIGATING AND TAKE
ALL APPROPRIATE ACTIONS TO
PROTECT ANYONE THREATENED BY
THESE COWARDS.
LET'S GIVE YOU ALSO A SECRET
SERVICE STATEMENT SO WE CAN ALL
SEE WHAT THE TIMELINE THIS WAS
AND EXACTLY WHAT THE SECRET
SERVICE FOUND.
THIS FROM THE SECRET SERVICE.
THE U.S. SECRET SERVICE
INTERCEPTED TWO SUSPICIOUS
PACKAGES ADDRESSED TO SECRET
SERVICE PROTECTEES.
IT WAS ADDRESSED TO HILLARY
CLINTON.
EARLY THIS MORNING OCTOBER
24th, 2018, SECOND PACKAGE
ADDRESSED TO FORMER PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA WAS INTERCEPTED BY
SECRET SERVICE PERSONNEL IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
THE PACKAGES WERE IMMEDIATELY
IDENTIFIED DURING ROUTINE MAIL
SCREENING PROCEDURES AS
POTENTIAL EXPLOSIVE DEVICES AND
WERE APPROPRIATELY HANDLED AS
SUCH.
BOTH PACKAGES WERE INTERCEPTED
PRIOR BEING DELIVERED TO THEIR
INTENDED LOCATION.
THE PROTECTEES DID NOT RECEIVE
THE PACKAGES OR AT RISK OF
RECEIVING THEM.
THE SECRET SERVICE HAS
INITIATED A CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION THAT WILL
LEVERAGE STATE, FEDERAL AND
LOCAL RESOURCES TO DETERMINE
THE SOURCE OF THE PACKAGES AND
IDENTIFY THOSE RESPONSIBLE.
THE SECRET SERVICE HAS A VERY
BROAD NETWORK OF OTHER FEDERAL
AGENCIES, STATE AND LOCAL, THAT
IT CAN TAP INTO HERE, BILL, IN
ORDER TO TRACE BACK THE ORIGIN
OF ANY THREAT TO A CURRENT OR
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
AND BY AND LARGE THOSE
INVESTIGATIONS ARE SUCCESSFUL.
SO I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF
IN THE NEXT EITHER HOURS OR
