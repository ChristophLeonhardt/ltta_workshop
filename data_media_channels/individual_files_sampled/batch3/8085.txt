LAWS. MUST BUILD A WALL. ABBY, OVER TO YOU. ABBY: THANK YOU, PETE. WELL, A MAJOR BREAST CANCER SCREENING MISTAKE. UP TO 270 WOMEN IN ENGLAND MAY HAVE DIED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT CALLED IN FOR THEIR MAMMOGRAM. HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE BLAMING IT ON A COMPUTER GLITCH, BUT HOW WILL THE GOVERNMENT RUN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM DEAL WITH THE BACKLOG AND COULD THIS HAPPEN HERE IN THE U.S.? JOINING US NOW IS BREAST CANCER SPECIALIST DR. NICOLE SAPHIER. ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU, DOCTOR. THIS IS A PRETTY UNFORTUNATE SITUATION. LIVES WERE LOST. HOW BAD IS THIS? IT'S A TRAGEDY ANY TIME A CANCER IS NOT FOUND ON EARLY DETECTION OR SCREENING PROGRAMS. IT'S AN ABOMINATION WHEN IT IS DUE TO A GOVERNMENT COMPUTER GLITCH. WHAT HAPPENED WAS IN THE U.K., UNDER THEIR GOVERNMENT SYSTEM, HAVE YOU TO BE INVITED TO UNDERGO YOUR CANCER SCREENING. IT'S NOT A CONVERSATION YOU ARE HAVING WITH THE DOCTOR. YOU GET A LETTER THAT SAYS YOU CAN GO AND GET YOUR MAMMOGRAM NOW. WHAT HAPPENED WAS A COMPUTER ERROR IN 2009 MADE IT SO 450,000 WOMEN DIDN'T GET THAT LETTER AND THEREFORE DIDN'T GET THEIR BREAST CANCER SCREENING. THEY ARE SAYING UP TO 270 WOMEN DIED FROM ADVANCED BREAST CANCER. PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT UNDERGO THIS SCREENING. REALLY, YOU WILL ONLY SEE SUCH A MONUMENTAL DISASTER AS THIS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT SINGLE PAIR GOVERNMENT-RUN SYSTEM. BECAUSE PATIENTS ARE CODIFIED NUMBERS ON A SPREADSHEET. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO AWAY WITH THAT DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. WHICH WE ARE STILL FORNGHTD TO HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES. YOU HAVE A LOFT DEMOCRATS CALLING FOR THAT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. BERNIE SANDERS IS OFTEN TALKING ABOUT SINGLE PAIR. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN IF WE IMPLEMENTED THAT HERE IN THE U.S.? BERNIE SANDERS LOVES TO USE MY FACE WHEN HE WAS UNILATERAL DEBATES WITH ME ABOUT SINGLE PAIR. BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HIS POSITIVE SPIN ON THIS. THIS IS A CATASTROPHE. AND, YES, IF WE IMPLEMENT A SINGLE PAIR SYSTEM, NOW, A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. IT'S CALLED UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE WHERE NOT ONLY IS GOVERNMENT IN CHARGE OF THE INSURANCE, BUT EVERYONE IS EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT. ALL THE PHYSICIANS ARE EMPLOYED BY THE GOVERNMENT. THEIR SCREENING PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY HAVE TO COST CUT AND RATION SOME OF THEIR CARE. THEY DON'T EVEN BENEFIT FROM BREAST CANCER SCREENING THE WAY WE DO IN THE UNITED STATES. IF WE ARE TO GO TO ANY FORM OF SINGLE PAIR, BY THE WAY, CANADA DOES THE SAME THING. THEY DON'T HAVE NEARLY GREAT ROBUST SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE IN THE UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF BREAST CANCER SCREENING. IF WE GO TO A SINGLE PAIR SYSTEM, COST ALSO NEED TO BE CUT. AND IN THAT LARGELY DOES COME FROM PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE AND SCREENINGS. SO THAT IS A HUGE CONCERN I HAVE FOR US. ABBY: SHOULD WOMEN BE CONCERNED HERE IN THE U.S.? WHEN YOU GO TO THE POLLS AND VOTE FOR A SINGLE PAIR SYSTEM YOU ARE SAYING I WANT TO BE A NUMBER ON A SPREADSHEET. YOU WILL BE SEPARATING YOURSELF FROM THAT DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. INSTEAD OF YOUR DOCTOR SAYING TO YOU THESE ARE YOUR RISK FACTORS, YOU NEED TO START YOUR SCREENING NOW, YOU ARE ON A SPREADSHEET AND YOU WILL GET A LETTER TELLING YOU IF AND WHEN YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING.
