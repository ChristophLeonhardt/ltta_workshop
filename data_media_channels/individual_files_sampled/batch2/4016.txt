LGBTQ and civil rights activists are promising to put up a fight after that New York Times report we told you about yesterday that says the Trump administration is considering a move that would in effect roll back protections for transgender people with narrowly defined gender as male or female based on genetalia at birth one actress and activist Laverne Cox has taken that fight to Twitter pushing her followers to show up next month and vote the orange is the new black star also writing quote in the face of this affront on my existence and the existence of my community I choose love not fear we exist and always have Laverne Cox joins me now from Los Angeles liver and thanks so much for coming on the show good morning Haley thank you so much for having me so I had a chance to ask President Trump about this as he left the White House for Houston yesterday here's that interaction mr. president what about your promise to protect transgender Americans are you bring up on that well looking at it we have a lot of different concepts right now they have a lot of different things happening with respect to transgender right now you know that as well as I do and we're looking at it very seriously you know what I'm doing I'm protecting everybody I want to protect our country Laverne do you believe in any way the president is trying to protect transgender Americans I've learned Hallie not to really listen to anything that our president says but I prefer to look at what the administration is doing and from day one the administration has attached trans people they've rolled back protections for transgender children in schools when 78% of transgender youth are bullied and harassed in school the president has attempts to ban transgender people from the military to appellate courts upheld the trans people have a right to serve in the military and this latest memo is an example of what the administration is doing so I think it's important to look at what the administration is doing and not what they're saying and I also want to say that it's been a really difficult past few days for transgender people all over this country and for the people who love us and I think it's important for us to hold each other close and tight and to really embrace love and not fear they want to make us afraid but we need not be afraid this policy has not been implemented yet we can right by it it we can fight so on that it's interesting you bring up the concept of fear here because the Washington Post had a piece out from somebody believed to be the only openly elected transgender Republican 27 year old Jordan Evans who tells the Post she's afraid for people who are younger than me people who don't have the kind of experiences in the world that I've had they see this and they're rightfully terrified talk about what specifically is at stake here for the transgender community well what well in the effort to redefine gender in a binary way and again a codified way it's about legislating transgender people out of existence but I think it's important for people to know this is not anything new over the past three years and state legislatures all over the country over a hundred pieces of legislation have been introduced and state legislatures basically trying to excommunicate transgender people from public life but we have fought those battles and we have won earlier this year in Anchorage Alaska the citizens of interests to Anchorage said that we do not support discriminating against transgender people and next month in Massachusetts the citizens of Massachusetts have an opportunity to do the same thing by voting YES on three and everyone who knows someone in Massachusetts can say call your friends and say vote YES on three to send a message to this administration and send a message to your fellow Americans that this kind of discrimination is not who we are and it will not stand so here we are two weeks out from the midterms you are saying hey get out there and fight you make the point and we can pull it up here of what this administration has done when it comes to rolling back transgender protections so for example signing a directive banning those transgender military recruits Attorney General Jeff Sessions deciding a civil rights law does not protect transgender workers from essentially employment discrimination we're sending protections for transgender students that has allowed them to use bathrooms that match their gender identity so in these next two weeks and frankly Laverne over the next two and a half years talking about how you're gonna use your platform you're one of the most visible transgender Americans in this country how do you help motivate people to make change in the way that you're describing I think people need to be aware of what's going on first of all so I okay was only made aware of the yet on three initiative in Massachusetts last week so I'm heading to Massachusetts tomorrow to get the word out that folks need to vote YES on three in Massachusetts and we need to be aware that in state legislatures all over the country folks are continually trying to introduce legislation banning transgender people from public life we can change our policies in our schools and our local municipalities and just support transgender people and send a message to our administration to our elected officials that this is not who we are you seem optimistic Laverne is that a fair assessment I am optimistic because over and over again the courts have held that transgender people are covered by title nine in title seven earlier this year the Amy Stevens case I'm it's upheld that transgender I think it was the Sixth Circuit that transgender people are covered by title seven ash Twitter Cruz cave also helped held that transgender people are covered by title nine so we've won in the courts repeatedly and the I'm citizens of Anchorage when they listen to the lived experiences of trans people said that we do not want to support discriminating against these people they want to fear monger and say the transgender people are not who we say we are and Emily we just want to go to work we want to go to school safely we want to live the American dream and everyone should have the right to do that and that's what I believe in I'm a proud American and I believe and the possibilities of this country my life would not be possible if people were not for America so that's why I'm hopeful and I think if we all come together and support transgender folks and support we house after what support people of color women undocumented folks we have to keep supporting each other and go out and vote November 6th thank you for checking out our YouTube channel why don't you subscribe it's
