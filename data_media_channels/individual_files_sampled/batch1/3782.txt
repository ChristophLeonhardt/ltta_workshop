is it just me or if IMAX screens gotten a lot smaller growing up I associated IMAX with those gigantic screens that immersed you in amazing environments like the ocean floor the Arctic wilderness and outer space I just paid twenty dollars and fifty cents to see I Frankenstein in IMAX 3d at the AMC 15 in Kips Bay and honestly the screen looked a little puny it's because IMAX no longer solely represents the experience that I had when I was a little kid but they're not telling you that the IMAX screen at Kips Bay right behind me is 30 feet high and sixty-four feet wide but a few blocks uptown at AMC's Lincoln Square 13 their IMAX screen is 80 feet high and a hundred feet wide the surface area for the IMAX screen at Lincoln Square is four times bigger than the one at Kips Bay the experiences are completely different but they're both sold as the same IMAX experience for nearly the same price so unless you're certain that the theater has a gigantic IMAX screen like the ones you grew up with there's a chance that you're gonna be paying for what some people affectionately refer to as WiMAX but I think that's a little harsh I prefer to use the phrase a nice junior the official slogan of IMAX is IMAX is believing well if you expect me to believe that what I saw down it Kips Bay was IMAX well it doesn't matter because they already have my money you
