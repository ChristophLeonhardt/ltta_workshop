and how are you reconciling that with what's going on in wresting industry yeah so look obviously it's incredibly incredibly disturbing what what we've learned in the last 24 hours from the reporting from the New York Times and variety and incredibly incredibly sad first of all you know you have to feel for the women who endured this and and and lived with it and and have come forward and you know obviously I've known Matt for 25 years and I didn't know this man and you didn't see this comment you didn't know look I mean what's chronicled incredibly well and in variety and the New York Times is you know deviant and predatory behavior and you know obviously that is not something that I was ever aware of or had even heard of or had ever been suggested or anything like that and it's just incredibly incredibly heartbreaking was the when you were there the today the Today Show was it like it's been depicted as a real boys club raucous kind of place what is that is that a fair characterization and yeah so so I've been gone from this a show for 17 yes right so I was at the Today Show I was executive producer the Today Show from 1990 to 1992 2000 and you know that's not a character raised the way that I would have characterized the show at all at the time and you know obviously you know in that time that I was there I was at NBC for 25 years for five years of my career you know no one ever brought to me or to my knowledge there was never there was never a complaint about Matt there was never a suggestion of that kind of deviant predatory you're not even a whisper of it nothing like that so you know I can't I can't say that that's the culture that that we lived in right what about what we'll definitely ship topics in a second here what about it CNN right now I imagine every media met every company in the country but every every media company is reconciling with this right or trying to figure out do we have a problem what's going on I know that this Jake Tapper's show there was an announcement yesterday what's been going on CNN with him amidst all this yeah look I mean obviously I think I don't think it's just the media world either right obviously but clearly the media world is not immune we had a senior producer on one of our programs in Washington State of the Union where there were there was a behavior that was completely inconsistent with our standards and and culture and and we dismissed him last week and you know look like like the way that NBC was when I was there the way CNN is today if we are aware of any if any of that is brought to our attention will investigate immediately and that's what we did last week and I think that you know I'm sure that's what's going on everywhere you
