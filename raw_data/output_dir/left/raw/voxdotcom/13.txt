1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,880
Christopher Columbus is all over America.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,280
There are statues in his honor.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,540
Streets and cities are named after him.

4
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,590
He’s got his own national holiday-- complete
with parades.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,480
For centuries, Columbus has been celebrated
as the “brave explorer” who “discovered”

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,540
the “New World.”

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,540
"We celebrate Columbus Day."

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:31,140
"The anniversary of that day in 1492, when Columbus first sighted the land of the New World, America."

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,600
But Columbus never even set foot on North

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
American soil.

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,140
His four voyages brought him to the modern-day
Caribbean islands, Central, and South America...

12
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,820
but never to the country where more than 50
cities, towns, and counties bear his name.

13
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,720
We rarely hear about the other explorers,

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,970
who actually landed in the US just a couple decades

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,530
after Columbus.

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,799
So how did a man who never even set foot in
North America end up with a national holiday

17
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,380
and a permanent place in American mythology?

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,470
Columbus and his arrival in the Americas is
mostly introduced to kids through books, songs

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,800
or cartoons like this one:

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,740
“I will discover a shortcut to India and
bring back some of the great wealth I find

21
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,750
there.

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:23,820
And I can do it, for I know the world is round.”

23
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,500
One of the many problems with cartoons like
this one is that it taught a lot of wrong

24
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,550
information.

25
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,570
Children were told that Columbus defied conventional
wisdom and proved the world was round.

26
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,400
But at the time people already knew the earth
was round.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,990
Columbus actually claimed the world was smaller
than predicted, and he was wrong.

28
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,390
Children were also told that Columbus’ voyages
to the inhabited islands in the Americas were

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,400
peaceful...

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,000
“The people Columbus called Indians were
very friendly, and they gave Columbus and

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,470
his men many gifts.”

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:58,520
But they don’t mention that Columbus and
his men were responsible for mass deaths of

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,690
native people.

34
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,370
A friar who lived on the islands Columbus
reached and experienced the brutality of the

35
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,470
conquest, wrote about it:
He wrote:

36
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,919
“They forced their way into settlements,
slaughtering small children, old men and pregnant

37
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,030
women.”

38
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,980
These details have been kept out of most textbooks
from the beginning, allowing Columbus to become

39
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,060
an American icon.

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,170
The idealized version of Columbus is as old
as the United States.

41
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,640
It all began during the War of Independence,
when the US fought the British.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,800
The new nation needed a rebellious, non-British symbol.

43
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,630
And they found one in Columbus.

44
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,170
Once the US won independence, streets and
cities were named after him.

45
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:41,180
Columbus’ iconic status was further cemented
in 1828, when Washington Irving published

46
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,360
a biography glorifying him.

47
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,450
He described him as

48
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,660
Brave, heroic and a genius.

49
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,540
But he neglected to mention his brutal treatment of indigenous people.

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,020
But Columbus’ real big break came in the
late 1800s-- when the country he’d never

51
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,260
visited started experiencing some massive
changes.

52
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,420
Italian immigrants were arriving in the United
States in big numbers.

53
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,130
And they faced harsh discrimination.

54
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:10,020
They were treated as perpetual foreigners
and restricted to manual labor.

55
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,700
Their Catholic beliefs opened the door for
even more discrimination.

56
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,340
So they embraced Columbus.

57
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,220
Afterall, he was Italian and Catholic and
already admired.

58
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,330
So he quickly became an icon for Italian
immigrants who argued that they, too belonged

59
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,890
in America.

60
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,190
On the 400th anniversary of Columbus’ arrival,
in 1892, “Columbus Day” was first brought

61
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,739
into the school system.

62
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:36,980
Schools held celebrations and students pledged
allegiance to the flag for the first time,

63
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,129
associating Columbus with patriotism in classrooms
across America.

64
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:46,450
A year later, Columbus became the theme of
the World Expo in Chicago, branding him America’s

65
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,680
hero around the world.

66
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,200
As Columbus and his legend became further
embedded in American culture, so did the Knights

67
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,350
of Columbus, a Catholic social club 
founded by Italian immigrants.

68
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:00,750
By 1937, the Knights of Columbus had gained
enough influence to convince

69
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,410
president Roosevelt to proclaim Columbus Day
a federal holiday.

70
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,360
But not everyone wanted to celebrate Columbus.

71
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,780
While the myth of Columbus had been developing
throughout history,

72
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,980
Native Americans in the US had been dealing
with destruction and discrimination for centuries

73
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,378
at the hands of all the European settlers
that followed Columbus.

74
00:04:20,379 --> 00:04:23,229
But in the 60s things started changing in
America.

75
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,900
As the civil rights movement demanded change,
Native rights became a part of the conversation.

76
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,540
"We've asked the federal government for hundreds of years to do things for our people or with our people."

77
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,820
"The government has only compromised, only given us token issues to deal with."

78
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,960
"We are here today as living factors of the problems that are still existing."

79
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:47,229
Historians started reexamining Columbus and
his story, correcting the myth and including

80
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:49,250
the missing historical facts.

81
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,300
As revelations about Columbus have become
mainstream, some people have rejected the

82
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,040
holiday.

83
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,500
As well as the man and the legacy behind it.

84
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:00,849
Today cities around the US are opting out
of celebrating Columbus Day.

85
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:05,750
In some cities they are choosing to celebrate
Indigenous Peoples Day instead.

86
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,340
At the same time more than half of Americans
think celebrating Columbus Day is a good idea,

87
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,760
according to a poll commissioned by the Knights of Columbus.

88
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,400
Most countries are formed with the help of
myths and heroes to forge a sense of unity

89
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
and belonging.

90
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,700
It's human nature.

91
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,560
But as the myth of Columbus is confronted
with brutal historical facts, the US will

92
00:05:26,569 --> 00:00:00,000
have to decide which myths are worth keeping
and which ones to discard.
