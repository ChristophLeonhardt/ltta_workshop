the International Paralympic Committee has upheld its ban on Team Russia for the upcoming 2018 Winter Games however clean Russian athletes that will be allowed to compete in South Korea in March under a neutral flag are teased Peter Oliver joins me now live with more on the decision at Peter what does the ruling mean hi well what this means is the ban that was in place for the Rio Summer Games back in 2016 has been upheld for the upcoming Pyeongchang Winter Olympics went to power Olympics it does mean though that Russian athletes will be able to compete as neutral so that means no mentioning of Russia on their team uniforms no flag in no national anthem what we did hear from the president of the International Paralympic Committee while he was upholding that that ban was that there has been great strides made against doping in Russia he said that there was now confidence in the anti-doping system in place in Russia today whereas previously there had been well what they saw is corruption and compared complacency however the president did tell me this under these ruling it was still possible that clean athletes would be banned from competing in Pyeongchang the athletes were implicated in a system so only the athletes that we can prove and therefore they meet strictly the criteria that was set up are the ones that we were allowed to compete so it's not a matter of if I think it's fair or not it's a matter of meeting a criteria that was approved by the IPC governing board all 67 Russian athletes that had hoped to take part in the power Olympic Winter Games were tested did test positive however what we're hearing is only around 30 to 35 will be able to take paths to take those neutral slots that's due to the criteria that the IPC president just spoke about there but this announcement comes on the day of her another big development in the world of anti-doping relating to the bottles that doping samples are actually caught in the the somewhere the samples are provided to these samples and be samples now these containers are supposed to be impossible to open however laboratory just up the road from where I am in Cologne well they found that when frozen those bottles open very easily now that's important because they be samples well they're the ones that are frozen and those be samples are the ones that are crucial to proving if an athlete is guilty or innocent of having used performance-enhancing drugs now just a little while ago I spoke to the chief medical director of the International para Olympic Committee I'll be back in around an hour or so to bring you more on what he said about that developing story as well okay Peter looking forward to that that's our tease Peter Oliver with the latest there now before today's IPC announcement there were calls for a complete ban on Team Russia the head of Germany's Paralympic Committee said the decision should not differ from that which was taken in Rio when it was an at when it announced its decision the IPC said that Russia had failed to meet two conditions for it to be allowed to compete again RTC gorged on of takes a closer look at Russia's Paralympics saga all of them have a disability but each and every one of them have proven themselves very able they spent years defying the odds training for the Rio 2016 Paralympics they had a dream but what they got instead was reality what would you choose dr. rods no idea Bob Scheer they knew more time torsos Warner papad oh yes you're about to do your private sport the miniatures region new - new quad Opie river no my use is not not oh yes La Marche nipples look vegetables to pair Elizabeth and Demetrius cause all stoniest shall suffice no peril my misery looks of tarragon yolk these people are cheats apparently by the standards of the International Paralympic Committee at least weeks before the games in Brazil the whole Russian team was hit with a blanket ban not a single athlete allowed to participate the decision was based on a report it's evidence and key witness still suspicious to those named and shamed the McClaren investigation accused Russia of running an elaborate doping scheme orchestrated by the Kremlin's top brass according to the report a key Russian lab routinely swapped dirty samples for clean ones resealing the bottles how did the Russians do it a lot of people would love to hear MacLaren's take on this mclaren says his word is evidence enough I've seen it I've seen it done and I've inspected it and it can be done and it can be reinserted we don't know how the Russians did it but we know that it can be done the report revolves around the eyewitness account of Grigory watchin cuffed he is the former head of Moscow's anti-doping lab and says he was one of the cogs in the doping conspiracy in Russian he's a wanted man facing charges for destroying doping samples and abusing authority this is a clear violation of the burden of proof and assumption of innocence it's ethically and legally not acceptable in doping cases it is a well-established rule you have to prove as a Doping agency that for 99.9% somebody has doped mcclure report is not proof enough to make a collective ban on all athletes there must be something else and this else is politics presumption of innocence out of the window guilty by association these people have been stripped of everything their flag national anthem and colors we cannot have the Russians completing again until they have adopted the right policies that sure that they are a clean nation never mind cleaned athletes they have to be a clean nation in the wake of the scandal Russia admitted to having a doping problem and has since tightened the legal screws only a handful of countries across Europe considered doping a criminal offense Russia now does yet the Paralympic committees decision has been to ban and those guilty by association gets sports capital punishment he goes down of RT to discuss this further I'm now joined by Alan Moore host of capital sports on Moscow's Capital FM radio station hello Alan always good to see you and now the IPC president said banning athletes is not a matter of fairness is about meeting the criteria what do you think about that line of arguments well I Nicki is it's good to charity again I mean I think he says himself that it doesn't matter what he thinks it was fair or not he said that they're just holding to this line but everything that they said today I mean it the you know there is a little bit of give in it that they allow some athletes between 30 35 to compete but a lot of us still doesn't make sense because ultimately as we all know this these decisions were based on an informants kind of wish to get away from Russia so I mean this is based on Rodchenko I think we have to be very very careful in how we we deal with this further and especially these athletes the parallel athletes they are already presumed guilty before they have a chance to prove your innocence clean test results be a ticket to the Paralympics so yeah Nicki I just miss that shouldn't clean test results be the ticket to the Olympics the Paralympics for sure for sure and I mean the wanting to say is that we know that there will be clean athletes there and you know it was raised at the press conference I think was asked by one of our Russian colleagues saying that you know look we know that there wasn't intensive testing don't allow Olympics he said oh we're here to speak with Pyeongchang not the last Olympics but as we know before Rio there was an absolute absence of testing for most of the athletes leading up not Russian athletes with general athletes so I mean you know if if athletes are testing clean regardless of what went before regardless of this criminal enterprise I was run by Gregorio chancof I'm not just within Russia boy when I started Russia as well I mean you know athletes who've been testing clean in the last you know 12 or 17 months as mr. Parsons brought up they should be allowed to compete now one of the unmet criteria was the reinstatement of the Russian anti-doping agency by the world body but the Russian Paralympic Committee is not responsible for this organization so why did the IPC make this demand on it I think Nikki that they had to try and give reasons why they were going to not just ban a number of Russian athletes we're trying to sort of say well look even though rosado not accredited were still net museun so they're trying to use lots of reasons that really would not hold water in a court of law I think I wrote the situation were solid they set themselves that the situation is greatly improved we know that living here ourselves and working here ourselves we see it daily however it doesn't make sense whatsoever and again we go back to 32 35 athletes will go right now we believe but I do believe there's more twists and turns yet to come in this tale so we know that there'll be no Russian symbols in South Korea the only places that athletes will be able to show their flag or a simple is in their bedrooms what reaction do you expect from the Russian sports authorities to this I think in one way there would be outwardly a little bit of outrage in a little bit of kind of grumping but inwardly I think they'll be happy that athletes will go there because of you know the whole situation with funding for these games because remember para athletes are at the in in all countries are at the bottom of the food chain in terms of funding so just the fact that we there will actually help the Paralympic movement here in Russia globally of course as well but I think that out early Joe Crump in review they'll just be happy that your athletes will be taking part ok Alan Moore host of capital sports on Moscow's Capital FM radio station thanks for your time now the ban was imposed back in 2016 when the whole Russian Paralympic team was barred from the Rio games just weeks before the competition started some of the affected athletes told us how they felt no changes Roberto al-fatah most any Papa Luis Eduardo mobility read Rio to morale Dublin occurred at a reduced guitarist at very prescribed Nippon apocryphal preaching specimen which one should one those who needs abstract heroes of the sickness Nick factor of yo soy el Roboto I what about the booster parts besides still at the previous night's Makka pakka side mirror so check the divisor America the problem a the kilogram leaf resultado not such as which night to sheet sixty bottles a plastic Buddhism is evil so us Daria turtle the login button values - I didn't step sport relates to distant chairman a mutiny matzoh it is three million it zulan is it a master of the riot masters Elaine ianucci machine
