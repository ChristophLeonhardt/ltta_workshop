the president didn't just say that he would be open meeting of Commons under the right circumstances he said he would be honored to meet with him this is somebody who has starved his own people somebody that is threatened to destroy the United States just last week he put out a video showing the Capitol getting destroyed by North Korean fighters how could he be honored to meet with Kim Jong pheasant understands the threat that North Korea poses and he will do whatever it's necessary under the right circumstances to protect our country from the threat that they pose so Simon I guess because he is still a head of state so it's it is sort of a there's a diplomatic piece of this but the bottom line is the president's going to do what he has to do right now he's building a coalition in the region to isolate North Korea both economically and diplomatically to get the threat to take that threat down and and so I but that is his number-one priority right now is protecting this country and our people
