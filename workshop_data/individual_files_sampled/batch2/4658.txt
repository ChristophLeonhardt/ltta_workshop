also on judge Kavanagh schedule today Senator Claire McCaskill a red state Democrat in a tough re-election fight who faces mounting pressure from anti-abortion advocates to confirm that conservative judge I traveled to Missouri to meet with them they think 45 years after roe v wade this could be their moment in southern Missouri the t-shirts tell the story I vote pro-life outside senator Claire McCaskill's office activists are sending her a message I'm very proud to be here with pro-life generation and this Supreme Court fight is just step one for the susan b anthony list a group that's been fighting abortion for 25 years we are like abortion we hate abortion their ultimate goal to overturn roe v wade or at least effectively gut Roe by passing state laws that for example restrict late term abortions or require parental consent so these activists aren't stopping at claire mccaskill store they've held rallies at joe Donnelly's office in indianapolis heidi height camps in fargo 29 rallies in all targeting 7 senate democrats in states won by Donald Trump this is what people who are poster OB Wade I've been waiting for is that how you see it yeah I think that you know have an incredible opportunity here to put a justice on the court who could potentially turn the tide of the court and and open up the possibility of the states really being able to pass legislation that is reflective of the values of vaccine they're sending 500 canvassers into the streets right here armed with lists of voters who likely support their cause but usually don't vote in midterm elections how much is this issue a part of your vote the the whole abortion issue it's a lot that's a that is something that my wife and I both are against they visited 1.4 million homes so far with a goal of 2 million by November and while they're paid $10 an hour sitting around a kitchen counter it's clear they're not motivated by money but deeply held religious beliefs you're all church-going yes this seems to be a moment where people are recognizing that there's a lot of Americans you are pro-life are you more optimistic than you've ever been oh definitely yeah yes this is the time a lot of hope you know honestly for me when I voted I cast my ballot for Donald Trump and he became president polls show majority of Americans are for the right for a woman to choose what are you saying about polls law that's not what we've found at all and back outside canvassing 45 years after roe v wade became law kind of challenging sometimes a lot of challenges but it's worth it optimism that their time has come do you believe Senator Claire McCaskill should support Cavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court yes all right that's a hopeful sign my panels back to react Susan Dell / CEO Mark Thompson mark what's interesting of many things that's interesting to me is that I talked to a lot of groups that I thought would be heavily involved on the left in this fight against judge Kavanagh and privately many of them told me we don't know that we can win this one have has the left from your perspective seated this to the right well I don't know about that I hope not I think the two categories is the activism on the left and then there's there the Senate Democrats I'm not sure that either has seated in fact you know I'm still holding out for the extreme that no Democrats will vote for Cavanaugh and necessary even go so far as procedurally to break the quorum I don't think people seated but I think they know the odds that were up against because rarely is a Supreme Court nominee not confirmed but it just so happens Cavanaugh is is ranked or his polling is a right around where the last one we defeated was and that was Bork which was a big victory in the Reagan administration Reagan who is a Republican icon we defeated him and and to sort of my anecdotal and it's very anecdotal phone calling there's a new report that shows conservatives are vastly outspending liberals in the fight against Kavanagh on TV alone conservatives have spent seven and a half million dollars liberals 1.3 million does money matter in this season or what well it does when you look at those seven senators who are in Trump districts who are up for re-election it does and if they're putting a lot of pressure on through TV ads that certainly can have a potential does the door-to-door matter because about what they are looking at is these are people who we know are on our side but they don't we know that they generally don't vote in a midterm election if we can get them out in those seven states we could really do something and that's definitely part of the strategy and that makes it makes a lot of sense to do that plus you also see that happen when you see the door-to-door that's a lot to bring to a candidate that so they can look at it and assess it but I think at the end of the day we Kavanagh will get confirmed and that shows that elections have consequences and just as there were Democratic judges I didn't support I supported Barack Obama's choice to make them that's where we're at and I know it's very disturbing for a lot of people on the Left to hear but Kavanagh most people will say he is a qualified jurist you may not agree with his decisions but it doesn't take you there with a lot like Zoe Merrick garland I would agree and I would agree with that and by the way I elaine elena kagan it was a qualified juris I didn't agree with her but that doesn't take away the fact that she was a qualified juris much like Cavanaugh's hey there
