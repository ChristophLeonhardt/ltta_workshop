when I left on Wednesday I told you not to make everything more stupid or no one would be going to Disneyland no Disneyland for anyone no Disneyland you understand me I've been turning this car right around I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show damn it people every time I sign off the internet every time I finish the podcast I think to myself the world can't get any dumber and then the next time I come on I think things were so much smarter the last time I was doing a podcast and that's what happened over the weekend we're gonna get into all things and now file related and bend the knee and kneel and Knights of knee and all of it we'll get to all of those things but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at ring comm so rings mission is to make your neighborhood safer okay that's what they are there for burglars like to ring your doorbell find out whether your home and then break into your house this is how they don't get shot well one of the ways that you can prevent them from doing this is when they bring the doorbell and you have a ring video doorbell then you can actually see their face you can talk back to them if you are 3,000 miles away they will think that you are still at home plus you have the capacity to actually call the police from your ring video doorbell ring is amazing and they have a new floodlight cam so when things go bump in the night you'll immediately know what it is whether you're home or away the ring floodlight cam lets you keep an eye on your home from anywhere it's the ultimate in home security high visibility floodlights a powerful HD camera that puts security right in your hands with ring you are always at home right now go to go to ring.com slash Bend that's ring comm / Bend you get a hundred and fifty bucks off the ring of security kit the products are so good that I've spent my own money on them ring calm / Ben ring calm / Ben there's a reason they're so popular and you're seeing the ring signs pop out pop out pop up outside of other people's properties you should join the club ring calm / Ben for 150 bucks off the ring of security kit again I use that / Ben's that they know that we saw you okay so as I say everyone's moron that is the quick summary of today's episode so we can skip the rest of the show okay so the stupidity begins with the NFL everybody's trying to blame Trump for the advent of the stupidity now Trump has his own brand of silliness that he has injected in here and I actually don't think it's politically silly I think is bad for the country but I think it's politically smart but we need to start off with a simple fact the NFL politicized itself years ago this idea that Trump politicized the NFL is sheer nonsense it's just not true the NFL made a conscious decision to allow politics on the field okay they've done this for years in 2014 you recall after the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson Missouri the st. Louis Rams came out on the field and did the infamous hands up don't shoot pose as they were coming out of the tunnel onto the field big deal at the time did they get fined they did not get fined it was nothing from the NFL was fine with it no problem okay then in Colin Kaepernick decided that he was gonna kneel down from the national anthem on this during a preseason games at the NFL find him no they did nothing but what did the NFL do they threatened the Dallas Cowboys with fines if they were police decals in the regular season on their helmets after there was that shooting of police officers by a black lives matter associated radical in in 2016 so yeah so here's the headline if you had the decal on your helmet they would not allow you to wear the decal on your helmet okay same here if you wanted to wear cleats that paid homage to two victims of 9/11 the NFL said you are not allowed to do this some players did it anyway and then the NFL ended up waiving the fine but if you are even if you were even special breast-cancer gear then the NFL will threaten to find you if you did it in endzone dance that was too provocative the the NFL find you so the NFL cracked down on everything except for leftist political expression everything except for leftist political expression I assume that you know the response would be well they didn't crack down on Tim Tebow except the Tim Tebow kneeling to do his own private prayer is not really a political presentation kneeling for the national anthem pretty clearly is so the NFL had politicized itself long ago and then president Trump decided step in so let's be clear about something there was a consensus until the middle of last week until Wednesday of last week when last we left our story there was a consensus in the United States kneeling for the national anthem is a stupid thing to do it is an unpatriotic thing to do this was the general American consensus now there were some people who said well it's still patriotic to kneel for the anthem because you're really trying to say that the anthem isn't being fulfilled in the way that it was meant to be fulfilled okay you made the statement about the anthem the anthem is one of the few unifying features of American life they did the American flag the national anthem these are unifying features of American life and to kneel for the anthems that you are anti-american okay does there are plenty of ways to protest against police brutality or systemic racism these are things that you feel the necessity to do listen I think that you're wrong I think that you are you're operating on faulty assumptions according to the Washington Post there been 761 police shootings this year nine of them nine of them weren't of an unarmed black person and of those nine not on mine we're cases in which the person was just sitting around doing nothing in many cases there's questionable whether there's serious questions about confrontations with the police so the idea of cops are going around shooting people is in and of itself ridiculous that they're going around shooting people based on race not a lot of evidence to support that that said if you want to protest there are plenty of ways to protest making a specific statement that you're going to bow down during the national anthem on national TV it's a statement it's a political statement and it says that America is inherently steeped in racism founded in racism and inescapably tied to racism okay that's what that says so Americans didn't like that if you look at the polls Americans didn't like this end it was actually hurting the NFL's ratings the NFL had a a trio of serious PR problems before the middle of last week the NFL had the CTE scandal you know the fact that if you get hit in the head many times then you're likely to end up or it's possible that you ends up with brain damage they could end with early death CTE is is a brain disease in which you get plaque in your brain essentially and that comes from too many hits to the head so that was one thing the NFL had to deal with the NFL also had to deal with serious spate of domestic violence incidents where a bunch of their players were not going around women and the NFL you recall this with Ray Rice the NFL didn't know what to do they sort of said that they were gonna do something that it didn't do anything and then they did something again so that was the second thing and then they had the Kaepernick thing all of this was contributing to a drop in ratings for the NFL and in fact JD Power did a poll and it showed that for whatever number of people were not watching the NFL anymore who had watched before 26% of those people said that their number one reason for turning off the NFL was the national anthem protests they didn't like the politicization of sport which makes sense we have to have a water-cooler culture we have to have something in common we don't have politics in common we don't have church in common we don't even have entertainment in common but sports seem like a pretty easy one right bunch people run around after a ball how do you screw that up well we found a way to screw it up so the NFL was facing all these promise there is a consensus the consensus was people like Colin Kaepernick dholtze doing stupid things not good for the country but should Colin Kaepernick be fired because of that probably not most people didn't really feel like it was necessary to call for a fireman didn't really feel like it was important to to call for a firing or if the owners wanted to fire on their own recognizance that's their that's their problem I mean right they it's a private business if they want to fire a Kaepernick they can fire Kaepernick that's their call what it is not is the government's job to get involved the government should not be involved in this now the reason those of us on the right thought this is because we don't like when the government or government actors sound off on these issues generally right how would we feel if President Obama had said about Brendan ice the former CEO of Mozilla that it's a good thing that Mozilla fired him after all the guy was for sitting it was for traditional marriage I mean that's pretty discriminatory we would evolve in fighting men who'd have said what business is it of the presidents of the United States to make noises about that imagine for a second to counterfactual let's say Tim Tebow gets down on a knee but he doesn't just get down on a knee to pray he gets down on a knee because he's overtly protesting the abortion culture in the United States and let's say the Barack Obama is the president he comes out and he says that's inappropriate Sports is sports cut that stuff out I hope Tim Tebow gets fired somebody needs to fire Tim Tebow let's boycott the NFL until Tim Tebow is fired we already said wait a second is that the job of the president like - our job to decide whether or not we want to watch a game it's the owners job to decide whether or not somebody gets fired so this was the consensus stupid politics are stupid and also it's the owners job and the patrons job to decide whether they want to watch something or fire somebody this was the consensus it was pretty well settled you weren't seeing a significant increase in the number of NFL players who were kneeling for the anthem it was basically Colin Kaepernick and now it's not even Kaepernick because the guy doesn't have a job he's a crappy quarterback so that is the lead-up then along comes president Trump now I'm not sure that what President Trump did last week was politically designed I'm not sure that he meant to to start this firefight I think that Trump likes to say things to audiences where the clap right I think that's really as deep as it goes for president Trump but the effect of what President Trump does is that President Trump whether he likes it or not basically no matter what he says it's going to be taken the same way that reverse I ecology has taken with my three-year-old so the way that I get my three-year-old to eat her to eat her food as I say to her sweetheart you're not betting no you're not big enough to eat all that food you can't eat all that food no way and then she goes yes I can I'm a big girl then she eats all her food right well no matter what Trump says the left responds like three-year-old so whatever Trump says they immediately respond with you say we shouldn't kneel for the anthem not only will we kneel for the anthem we'll stretch during the anthem not only will we kneel for the anthem will poop on the field that's what we'll do just to show you cuz Trump huh-huh okay so Trump leads all this off with statements that really are divisive and not useful okay so here's the part of what Trump says that's that's useful what he says that's useful is kneeling for the national anthem is stupid agree everyone agrees but that's not enough Trump goes further he gets back into his full-on WWE TV persona and he decides that he's going to call for people to be fired right he's gonna go you're fired he's even gonna bring out his old slogan because he's not getting anything done legislatively and everybody sort of disappointed in him and people are sort of frustrated so he's gonna bring back an applause line in Alabama because whenever he gets in front of a crowd this is what he does Trump is a consummate performer it's what he does for a living he's not president for a living he's a performer for a living who happens to be president that's how he got here he didn't get her through great legislative leisure domain that's not how he got here yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna play the tape of Trump and explain what happens next in just a second but first let me say if things feel chaotic if things feel like we are on the brink of a national disaster if it feels like the the North Koreans could try to fire a nuke at us at any moment because they're making those kinds of noises if you feel like natural disasters around the corner you need to have enough food in your house so you don't have to worry about the the local grocery stores shelves being non stocked you're not to worry about the government being able to get to you that's why you need to go to my friends over at my Patriots supply and get their new survival food supply for just 99 bucks it

it tastes like home cooking so make sure that you're taken care of and then you don't have to worry about it prepare with Ben dot-com 888 803 1413 okay so President Trump so president Trump goes to Alabama and it's a rally and he decides that it's time to drop some red meat so here's President Trump dropping the red meat wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners when somebody disrespects our flag to say get that son of a chop that field right now out he's fired okay so the the the him condemning the the players who kneel I'm fine with that I've been doing it for years now I think most people in the United States have been doing it for years he is the President of the United States he is not a Breitbart commenter he is not the local drunk at your pub okay he's the presidents of the United States and now it's time for the president to be the president perfectly fine for him to say people should not kneel for the national anthem it destroys a feeling of unity that America is built upon we all strive to do better not okay for the President of the United States to say the owners should move to fire people and that's not where Trump stops so Trump goes to Twitter and he unleashes a full-on hurricane five-level tweet storm so here's what he tweets if a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL or other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our great American flag or country and should stand for the national anthem if not you fire find something else to do okay so here is the problem there are a couple of words here to start that are a problem one aloud right go back to that first tweet for a second aloud okay so in that first tweet should not be allowed by whom by whom okay the NFL gets to make its own rules if they decide they want to let these dole to be dholtze that's their problem but this allowed coming from the President of the United States carries the patina of government action Trump probably doesn't mean that okay Trump doesn't even have the power to get a health care bill pass but this is the kind of stuff that the presidents of the United States should be saying and then when he says that they should be fired again I ask you if the situation reversed take off your take off your partisan hat for a moment if he had said no one should be allowed to kneel against our great American law roe v wade if not you're fired how would you feel about that and if you say if you'll find about that your line okay and here is president Trump continuing along these lines and then he tweets Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country tell them to stand ok like look this part I don't have a problem with ok Roger Goodell you know again private industry I don't think the president the United States should be saying this I agree with the general sentiment again there's a difference between when I say it or you say it and the president says it because he has a different role in the American Republic this is not something the president should be doing ok then he then he continues again he just can't let this thing go because he thinks he's got a winner here and he does okay here's the irony the irony is that Trump does have a winner here so Trump says if NFL fans refused to go to games until players stop disrespecting our flag and country you'll see change take place fast fire or suspend so now he's openly calling for people to boycott a particular business until they suspend to fire someone imagine if Barack Obama said everyone should stop patronizing chick-fil-a until the owner of the business is moved out of power would that be ok the answer is no and then he says NFL attendance and ratings are way down boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country League should back us again it's just more and more of the same he feels like he's a terrier with a bone and now he's not gonna let it go and he continues along these lines just never ends great solidarity for our National Anthem and for our country standing with locked arms is good kneeling is not acceptable bad ratings I don't know if that was translated into North Korean and then into Korean and then back into English but in any case when he says here you know I actually here's what I suggested I said listen if you want to show solidarity with the people who are kneeling but you disagree with them then put your hand on their shoulder or something and then say after the game I disagree with him but it's his right to say what he wants to say and that's America the Trump I think is sort of trying to say the same thing there but ok then if it says courageous Patriots have fought and died for a great American flag we must honor and respect it make America great again and then the choir starts singing ok so I agree I agree with all of this I agree with all of this but again he's the president I am a talk show host okay there's a difference is that is that the the finale of his great rant I think that's a fan Alan Alan is great right then that's not all he sends his Treasury secretary Steve minuchin to go out and comments on this to again why is the president involved in telling private businesses what to do okay as a conservative I want the government less involved in telling private businesses what to do even if I disagree with what a business is doing there are plenty of businesses that I think are full of Schmucks that doesn't mean that as the president of the United States I get to tell them what to do so again two things can be true at once you should not kneel for the anthem it makes you an a-hole to as the president of the United States you should not going or you should not go around telling other businesses to fire people based on political predilection okay this makes you malfeasance in your duty okay so here's Steve minuchin a guy most famous recently for using taxpayers dollars so he can take his wife on their honeymoon or something here's Steve minuchin explaining why why Trump is right - Jake Tapper on CNN the NFL has all different types of rules you can't have stickers on your helmet you have to have your uniforms tucked in what the president is saying and I think the owner should meet and they should vote on a rule this is about respect for our military this is about respect for our first responders this is not about Republicans or Democrats players have the right for free speech off the field on the field this is about respect for lots of people and I don't understand why there's rules that when the Dallas Cowboys wanted to put stickers on their helmets out of respect for people there they couldn't do it okay right now why is the Treasury Secretary of the United States commenting on this why okay we complain when Barack Obama and his and his government got involved in trying to regulate the name of the Washington Redskins and we said why are you talking about this go do your stupid job you stupid okay and now everybody's time out okay so why is this really happening it's because Trump's actually doing something quite clever okay whether he means to or not what he's doing right now is quite clever what he is doing is he is saying I am on the side I right here I'm on the side of the national anthem of the flag I love it it's great and then he knows the Democrats are gonna respond like three-year-old children and say yeah would you like to flag you like the anthem screw you I hate the anthem I hate the flag food and that's exactly what Democrats do ok naturally this is exactly where Democrats go because they just can't help themselves so here's a former Maryland Democratic Representative saying that all NFL players should kneel in response to Trump and she said Sunday I hope every NFL player takes a knee in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick against the white supremacists who squats in our White House so what happens a lot of the NFL players do they decide that they hate Trump so much they're gonna kneel for the anthem so here's what the lefties and here's what the right seats cuz we now live in completely different bubbles right we don't have conversations with each other we don't talk with each other we don't try to stand they understand each other so here's what the Left sees the left sees a bunch of people kneeling to protest a President of the United States making statements that are beyond his Ken right the president should not be commenting on the Siletz all kneel in solidarity to show that we don't like what the president said here's what the rest of America sees they see a bunch of people kneeling during the national anthem that people have fought and died to protect they see a bunch of people disrespecting the flag that a bunch of people have fought and died to respect so what the Left did is they took an unpopular protest movement but not a protest movement that no one on the left was seriously backing and then they made it there they made it their rallying cry this is what we're gonna rally around now is this unpopular stupid thing and Trump's standing over here going I love the flag it's great look at all these people kneeling it's not about me they hate the flag hate the national anthem mm-hmm right and it's it's so everyone so the real debate here is not even had the real debate is whether it's appropriate to kneel for the flag half the people kneeling about the flag and national anthem are doing it specifically to piss off Trump if you think you're pissing off Trump you're wrong okay Trump is winning because of this even here in one-back Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by kneeling during the national anthem are you out of your mind but the Democrats think they're gonna win with the air base Trump thinks he's gonna win with his base and they're both sort of right they're both sort of right so what breaks down the only thing that breaks down is our capacity to speak with one another Americans are the ones who got hurt right we just want to be watch our football and drink a beer and be left alone that's all it's all we ask is it so much I've been saying this about sports for years I was saying this when the NFL was trotting out beyond say to do a blacklivesmatter routine during halftime or ever Katy Perry who's a very political person right I've been saying this for a long time let me watch my sports and leave me alone and they won't do it and now Trump has just taken it to the next level he's just taking it to the logical next step and now everybody's mad okay and now we have nothing to talk about the ratings for the NFL are going to tank because the NFL is gonna defend its players people are gonna get mad they don't want to watch the players kneel for the anthem they think it's unpatriotic because it is now there are people who say it's not unpatriotic for two reasons one is when you kneel for the anthem then you're really kneeling because you respect the anthem right it's because you respect the anthem so much and we're not living up to it okay this I seen I think is a poor argument this runs in the same category as people who say the burning the flag is showing the highest form of respect to the flags we're burning the flag to show the flag doesn't live up to what we think it should live up to okay that's not really what kneeling for the anthem shows okay the other thing is a little more understandable that is it's not unpatriotic to kneel because we're not kneeling because we don't like the anthem of the flag well not kneel we're kneeling because we want to show Trump that he can't tell people not to kneel okay again stupid but not unpatriotic but what a lot of people in the middle of the country see is people kneeling during the anthem here is what people say and you're gonna see what you want to see right here's what you're gonna see LeSean McCoy right who is a running back for the Buffalo Bills this is what he was doing during the national anthem not even kneeling stretching okay that's garbage thing to do I don't care what reason you're doing that for stretching during the national anthems a garbage thing to do it's I've been kneeling right kneeling is bad enough but stretching is really just you being a garbage person so President Trump thanks LeSean McCoy for his campaign donation 2020 because they promise you this helps Trump this helps Trump and then it becomes a big thing right you've got national anthem singers who are kneeling you had one do it at the Seahawks Titans game right so you've got the color guard out there and then in the color guard is is out these are men and women serving in our American military standing there for the flag and the national anthem singer is kneeling in front of the people who are willing to spend their lives in their lifeblood protecting that flag in this national anthem it's gross so after singing mania well because we have to show that kneeling is important kneeling is not important again you want to show solidarity at the players don't kneel just hold hands with them while they kneel right here we're gonna lock arms locking arms is Trump Trump himself said I think he's right locking arms fine right we're all part of the same country as Lincoln said we must be friends not enemies so we must be brothers not enemies okay here's another national anthem singer kneeling again this is a Detroit in Atlanta okay so there are a lot of places where people were booed right the Patriots for example we're booed a bunch of them kneeled and the and the crowd booed them which i think is totally appropriate you can hear them booing the players right this is what Trump is done and this is what the left fell right into Trump said if you kneel you're unpatriotic and you should be fired and a bunch of people said I'm the left okay fine then we'll all kneel so what are you doing you're alienating your own audience here's a montage with all the players around the NFL kneeling into the Cleveland Browns who kneeled the who knelt and then just kept kneeling throughout the game cuz a snake just let shot McCoy and here's the Jaguars right there's the Atlanta Falcons the Jets are the P some people were locking arms okay so now I'm gonna show you how this breaks down because of what Trump did instead of this being a debate about instead of this being a debate about kneeling about police brutality it's turned into a debate about the national anthem itself and about Trump Trump has taken what was a tiny protest movement and turned it huge and in the process polarized the country in a politically intelligent way but in a way that's not very good for the country I'm gonna get to the hero of last night and get a hero of yesterday and then some of the villains okay so we'll get to that in just a second but first I want to say thank you to our friends over at blinka so you have a lot to do today right I mean it's a Monday you just came off a really stupid weekend and so now you have a backup email you got a lot of work to do you're not gonna be able to spend a lot of time reading are you just things that you want to read well that's why we can get in the car it's time for you to turn on blankest you need to download the blankest app because it allows you to go through the world's best books in 15 minutes or less they boiled down the main points of books into 15-minute power packets they call blinks and then you can listen to them it really is amazing I know a lot of people listen the show people like Dana Perino now use blankest and the reason for that is because blink is is just a tremendous way of gathering information you can spend five hours reading a book and come away with the same amount of material that you would in a 15 minute summary from blink is because how much of that book that you read three months ago do you actually remember and these are all the non-fiction books that you'd want to rate it's things like why nations fail 600 page book really good book do I fifteen minutes worth of material in it not really so if you listen to the blink now you just saved yourself for you saved yourself seven hours right the the titles that they have that are just derivative like two thousand titles it's things like Thinking Fast and Slow they're the famous Daniel Kahneman book about how the brain works that's a 400-page book okay what are you remember from it fifteen minutes worth of material probably that's why blink cast works blink us right now has a special offer just for our audience go to blink accom slash Ben right now and you get your free trial or three months off your yearly plan when you join today that's blink as to be Li n K ist blink cast comm slash men's to start your free trial or you get three months off your yearly plan blink is calm / ben if your information junkie like I am blink astiz indispensable go and check it out and make sure that you use slash pens that they know that we sent you okay so the big hero of yesterday when all was said and done was not any of the players who were kneeling it was one player on the pittsburgh steelers name is hala han throw them in the way of a he is a three he did three tours i believe in iraq and afghanistan and he is a West Point graduate he's an offensive tackle for the presberg Steelers the entire pittsburgh steelers team decided that it was necessary not to come out for the national anthem over all of this stupidity and the entire pittsburgh steelers team stayed in the locker room except for Villanueva who served in the line of duty in order to protect this national anthem and protect this flag and here is some video of Villanueva standing for the anthem Chicago Bears they came out they all linked arms didn't deal the only player on the Steelers who came out was this guy but he served in the military his jersey his jersey sales no one's ever heard of him his jersey sales immediately skyrocketed to number six that's good he is the hero of the day and if you are an NFL fan I recommend that you go online right now and buy a villanueva Jersey let's send it all the way to number one I'd like to see that be the number one selling jersey not Tom Brady not Aaron Rodgers this nearly anonymous offensive tackle who served in our military and stood up for the national anthem in the flag let's do that so go over to your your online wherever you get your jerseys online and go find Villanueva's jersey and buy one because I think that the more Americans where the villanueva Jersey the better off we are the better off we are obviously you know this guy is is the hero of the day and this is the new debate right Trump got what he wanted he got what he wanted he wanted us to be saying the heroes of the day are the people who stood for the anthem and the people who weren't kneel because that's what we felt before but now a lot more people are kneeling because they don't like Trump and you can see the the virtue signaling stupidity of the left here I mean it really is astonishing Alyssa Milano right the actress she took a picture of her kid kneeling because there's nothing better than politicizing your own child I know it's just wonderful I really object to this you know as I say I have two kids under four I keep them separate from politics I don't even put pictures online of them people who are willing to use their kids for this kind of stuff I really don't like it Alyssa Milano tweeted Thank You Donald Trump for giving me opportunities to teach my children the difference between right and wrong hashtag take Denis okay so what does a listen mallanna object to does she object to President Trump saying that people who kneel for the anthem RSO B's is that what she objects to or does she object to the President of the United States saying they should be fired if the latter then what I would like to know from Alyssa Milano is does she stand up for the rights of people to speak at Berkeley does she stand up for the rights of people to work at Mozilla Firefox does she stand up for the rights of people to continue working at their bakery if they don't wish to service a same-sex wedding like how much freedom in the workplace is Alyssa Milano for or is this just you know virtue signaling I think we all know the answer Stevie Wonder did this routine Stevie Wonder got down on one knee as well so it's become a big cultural thing now tonight I'm taking a knee for America that was a risky business there Wow so Monica Lewinski joke here I won't tell but in any case the the idea that that you know this is somehow doing some sort of great service to the United States for the United States if you're praying for America that's one thing that's normally what we mean when we kneel but this idea that we all have to take a knee for America that this is our solidarity is protesting the anthem so American solidarity now is protesting the things that we stand for that's weird my favorite one of these by the way was this surgeon who's the his name is Eugene gue MD and he says I'm an Asian American doctor and today I take the knee to fight white supremacy this currently has a 117 thousand likes on Twitter Eugene GU is a surgeon scientist hoping to cure heart and kidney diseases and babies he's blocked by President Trump he's the presidents of gamma Chan Inc and Stanford and Duke med school along let me just say that if we're talking about institutional racism I'm gonna go with Eugene GU does not really get to talk about that so much hey Jingu as i say went to Stanford and Duke Medical School and let's be clear about this 5% of the American population is Asian 20% of med school graduates are Asian last I checked so if we're talking about institutional racism I think they keep picking for examples so all of this resounds to Trump's benefit this is the amazing thing right if you're a Trump fan then you like all this if you're a big Trump fan you like all this not because you care about not because of what it does to the country I think it's terrible for the country but if you think that Trump needs political support the best way to earn political support is to play this game that they like to call a political sumo wrestling so sumo wrestling is about you get the person in the circle with you and then you throw them out of the circle all right you get your enemy in the circle with you and then you throw them a circle so what that means politically is you get everybody to agree to a certain proposition and then you take your enemy and you throw them out of the circle they don't believe in that proposition most people in America like the anthem most people in America like the flag if you get your enemy somehow to make the idiotic mistake of somehow saying I hate the flag I hate the anthem you have won and that's what Trump inadvertently did because the left is so damn stupid I mean so unbelievably stupid like light years of stupid basically the left does something dumb with you Trump does something dumber with regard to the anthem and then the left of something even dumber we are now in an endless vortex of stupid and we have not yeah it's a black hole stupid and eventually we will emerge on the other side MIT Romney will have been elected in 2012 you want to emerge on the other side of that wormhole that's how dumb everything is it didn't end there by the way Trump is now in a fight with members of the NBA as well so Steph Curry said that he wasn't gonna go to the White House to meet Trump okay as I've said before I think players have a right to do this I think Tim Thomas did that the the goalie for the Boston Bruins he did that with with Obama because he's a pro-life guy and obama's pro-choice i think that's perfectly acceptable Steph Curry said he didn't want to meet Trump so Trump instead of accepting that with good grace or just moving on and saying you know that's too bad I really would have liked to meet him you know just being gentlemanly instead Trump does what he always does which is you can't quit des fired right he tweets out going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team Steph Curry is hesitating therefore invitation is withdrawn he wasn't hesitating he said he wasn't gonna come so again that's the same thing that Trump did with his economic and jobs Advisory Council you remember this after Charlottesville all of them quit he said you can't quit I just banded your council now so Korea mediately responded by taking the high road he said this is beneath the president you know why he doesn't need to target certain individuals either you know rather than others I have an idea of why but it's kind of it's just kind of beneath oh I think of a leader of a country too to go that route it's not what leaders do okay so he hits the left loves this battle LeBron James also sounds it off because we definitely needed the King to sound off on all of this I mean our lives who not be complete without LeBron James political commentary here he is just a little frustrated man just because this guy that we've put in charge has taught us tried to divide us once again and obviously we all know what happened with Charlottesville and the divide that that caused then and now it's even hitting more home for me now even more because he's now using sports as the platform to try to divide us right okay so you know yeah I love again that LeBron James had no problem with Colin Kaepernick dividing us for President Obama dividing us but Trump is the one who's dividing us and this is the point okay we are now living in Dwight Eisenhower talked about the idea of this military-industrial complex we're gonna gut and get into wars that were stupid because we have this military-industrial complex that has an interest in building up our armaments and then using them so we'll get into were that are done this is what Eisenhower said in his farewell address in 1961 okay well when it comes to political cultural entertainment we have a political entertainment wing a political entertainment complex that has an interest in culture wars stupid culture wars culture wars that don't benefit anyone except the politicians and the cultural figures that's it they don't find a fit Americans then help the country they don't tie us closer together they divide us right now we're supposed to choose sports like if you love America you're supposed to choose NASCAR and if you hate Trump you're supposed to choose the NFL in the NBA this is the game that we're gonna play now the only people who benefit from this are cultural figures who get to feel very special about themselves and feel like they are culturally and politically important and political figures like President Trump will get to make hay off of this now the left is okay with this because the left dominates the culture right this is a point Ross dude hat is made over it over at the New York Times he says the left we've never had a greater dichotomy between politics and culture the right is dominating politics and the left is dominating the culture and that's because they act off of each other politics is people reacting to culture and culture is people reacting to politics but they also are clutched in this love embrace right where Trump loves this it's great for him politically and the left loves this culturally because great for them culturally they get to complain about America and talk about how terrible it is and talk about Trump and win some adherents and fans and double down with their own base everyone wins with their base the middle of the country everybody who just wants a better country where we can live together and respect each other's opinions we all hate each other and we think that were jerks now like it's made everything significantly worse this political entertainment complex is I tweeted yesterday politics and entertainment copulated and now they both have syphilitic brain disease politics has become infused with entertainment oriented stupidity and entertainment has become oriented

this is going on and this just goes to show you that Entertainment has overcome politics entirely president Trump tweets this okay so you had that giant tweet storm at the NFL that's what everyone's paying attention to you today because let's be frank it's more fun and entertaining to talk about that so here is President Trump tweeting about North Korea yesterday hey here is what he tweeted last heard Ford just heard foreign minister of North Korea speak at U n if he echoes thoughts of little rocket man they won't be around much longer exclamation point so the President of the United States is is threatening nuclear war and calling the dictator of North Korea little rocket man now so he's adding and he's like it's like little Marco and rocket man so that's excited this happens and the blowback is zero why because we've been in your to this but we've not been in your to the cultural war so we pay more attention to the culture wars then you know the possibility of a nuclear conflagration with another country so that's exciting meanwhile on policy everything precedes a pace right what's amazing about this is you recall that when I last we left our story I was talking about Jimmy Kimmel in health care remember that like a year ago like four days ago you remember that well this was supposed to be the healthcare push right Donald Trump was going to ram through the Cassidy Graham health care bill we were finally gonna repeal these parts of Obamacare we're gonna leave the the vast majority of it in place but we're gonna make some significant substance of changes to it Trump's closing pitch was the NFL is stupid and full of sons of bitches right that was his closing pitch which is just great you remember his closing pitch on health care last time was my Attorney General is terrible so his closing pitch needs a little bit of work and we're not paying any attention into the health care stuff meanwhile it's unclear whether the health care bill is gonna pass so why it doesn't the president focus on rounding up the votes for that because he is enjoying the limelight because again he's a performer he's not a politician so here's Rand Paul saying he's not gonna vote for the Graham Cassidy bill I think what it sets up is a perpetual food fight over the formula what apparatus and give it to Democrats say this is a bad idea it's not repeal however all that being said if they narrow the focus to the things we all agree on expanding health savings accounts giving governor's more freedom through waivers slowing down the rate of growth of an outrageous or out-of-control entitlement spending sure I'd be for that but I'm just not for this block granting concept because to me that is an affirmative vote that have agreed to keep Obamacare okay so here he is this is Rand Paul's deck by the way he's always too pure to vote for things you know again I I like Rand Paul a lot on a lot of things but in this case if this is the best that we're gonna do this is the best that we're gonna do I mean Ted Cruz and Mike Lee are saying they're gonna try and extract concessions in order to in order to vote on this thing which i think is the proper stance that's what Rand Paul should be saying if he wanted to make a better piece of legislation but he's not the only one so remember Republicans only have 52 votes in the Senate they lose three and the suckers done McCain is already saying he probably won't vote for it so that means they can only lose two more Rand Paul's and other ones that means any of vote lost anyone vote lost in the Senate and this latest Graham Cassidy you know Obamacare fix or Obamacare change goes down in flames Susan Collins is also saying that she probably won't vote for it so this thing is you know it's right on the brink this is where the president's weight could be useful Jake it's very difficult for me to envision a scenario scenario where I would end up voting for this bill okay so again this is where Trump really should be putting his efforts right now that is not where he's putting his efforts obviously okay time for some quick things I like and then a thing I hate and and then please when we break don't ruin things more guys it's just there's only so much more we can learn okay time for some things I like so Edward feasor I recommended one of his books the other day that was the last superstition here's a brand new book that just came out called five proofs of the existence of God it's about Aristotle Platonists Augustine Aquinas and Leibniz and it talks about the the logical proofs for God that that have been put forward over history and that really have not been well debunked by the secular theistic movement and it is not the the usual cosmological argument that you hear usually what you hear when it comes to the cosmological argument is everything has a creator therefore God right if everything has created therefore got and then that usually leads people like Sam Harris the the atheists I'ma be honest podcast that should be fun it leads people like Sam Harris to say well if everything has a who created God that's not what these arguments actually say okay that's not what the argument is and if you want the fully fleshed out argument in readable prose five proofs of the existence of God by Edward feasor is a is quite a good book I had an opportunity to speak with Professor feasor a little bit yesterday and clarify some of my own questions about the arguments that he was making in the book I think that it is well worth while do I think that these are dispositive do I think that do I think that they absolutely prove that God exists so I think it's possible to argue I think it's possible to argue with them but I think that they are a good logical presentation of what an argument in favor of God looks like that isn't based simply on revelation so yeah I think that that's that's a worthwhile thing so again five proofs of the existence of God from Edward feasor okay other things that I like I love that Nancy Pelosi who is the least hip person in the world although she may have had a hip replacement I don't know so maybe she got more hip recently but in any case Nancy Pelosi is very unhip and she doesn't know who colin kaepernick is or what football is or why she's here or what's going on in the room around her here she was yesterday trying to pronounce Colin Kaepernick's name he should see this as an opportunity somebody a common current conference company doing what he did says this flag enables me to do this colin campaka do good indeed so well done Nancy Pelosi demonstrating how cool you are okay finally time for a thing I hate the answer is everything okay but besides everything here's a specific thing that I hate so according to the Washington free beacon late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have coordinated behind the scenes for months to oppose Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare Kimmel whose son was born with a congenital heart disease has been an outspoken critic of the Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare because he believes the most recent Republican efforts to replace Obamacare don't protect people with pre-existing conditions like his son according to The Daily Beast so he has done a bunch of monologues this week he did something after I left the air if you want to see my monologue about Kimmel's monologue go back to last Wednesday's episode I did a very long explanation of what Kimmel was saying and why he's wrong and why it's not right to stand on your child's health condition in order to promote your views of health care in any case it turns out that Schumer and Kimmel were speaking Schumer encouraged camel to speak out in opposition to Graham and Cassidy's bill when it became apparent Republicans would try to pass it so in other words does Kimmel know anything about the Bell did he make an independent study no he's Democrat so he talked to Chuck Schumer he doesn't like anything that touches Obama care there would be no Republican program Jimmy Kimmel it back end of story that's the whole thing so long as that is the case that's all that matters so long as that's the case that is the only thing that matters right is that he was never gonna back anything Republicans had to propose so as a political put up job and I think that means something because we're gonna make an emotional appeal then we should know if you were planning to use the emotional appeal in order to promulgate your politics because you were talking with partisans on one side you didn't come to your own your own conclusions you just talked to Chuck Schumer and have it ahead and give you some talking points all right so we will be back here tomorrow in the meantime as I say everything's getting ruined just stop it take a break go out for ice cream enjoy your family enjoy your kids enjoy your neighbors we still live in the greatest country on the face of the earth and if we would look into each other's faces once in a while instead of trying to see into the blackness of each other souls the darkness of each other Souls then perhaps we'd all be a little bit better off I'll see you here tomorrow i'm ben shapiro this is the ben shapiro show
