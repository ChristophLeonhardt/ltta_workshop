talk a little bit about some trends in American thinking particularly among young people because this is pretty crazy stuff so there is a there's a article today about capitalism and how young Americans feel about capitalism from The Wall Street Journal and it is pretty stunning how few Americans young Americans particularly know what capitalism is so there's an article it says that in a 2016 survey for Harvard University's Institute of Politics 42% of younger Americans said they support capitalism only 19 percent identified themselves as capitalists is according to John della Volpe who's been pulling Millennials for 17 years right 42 percent of young Americans said they support capitalism which means 58 percent do not and 19 percent identified themselves as capitalists the reason that I think this is the case is because the Democrats and Bernie Sanders in particular have done a wonderful job of redefining capitalism away from its meaning and Republicans have never discussed capitalism in moral terms it's something I like talking about a lot the reason that capitalism is a good is not just because it's more efficient and creates better products is because it says that the stuff you create you get to keep the stuff that you create you get to keep and no one can be the master of your time or labor no one gets to enslave you just because they have needs right you're you this is the John Locke view of capitalism right John Locke's view of property ownership is that you combine your labor with the land and that's why you have a right to land the same thing holds true of capital you combine your labor with capital you compile you combine your input with capital your investment knowledge with capital and now that is your money and the idea that anyone can take that money away from you just because they want the money for their own purposes is morally obtuse but people on the right don't talk about capitalism this way instead what we'll say is well you know capitalism it's just sort of the best available system and there's also this tendency I think to to say as many have said in the past that did you know sort of two cheers for capitalism the capitalism is the best possible system but it doesn't tell you that you have to be moral that's true but when you're talking about economic socialism doesn't tell you that you have to be moral either there's nothing moral about socialism we're gonna talk about economic systems and why economic systems ought to be upheld from a moral standpoint you have to start from the basic notion that human beings have liberty that individuals are guaranteed liberty and they're all made in God's image we are all equal in our rights before God that does not mean that we all get to steal stuff from one another and socialism is immoral capitalism is moral but young people are never told that instead what they see is greedy plutocrats who are combining with the government and capitalism itself is slandered in the media so every time there is a an actual greedy plutocrat who makes a deal with the government any time in Wall Street gets rich off an insider crony zeal of Congress instead of people responding by saying that's not capitalism even the right we'll call it crony capitalism crony capitalism is not a real term crony capitalism is the reverse of capitalism it's actually called corporatism there is no reason to describe anything as crony capitalism because capitalism is about the free investment in exchange of goods but the right never describes capitalism that way and so young people don't know any better and so they ends up in this sort of weird spot where they think capitalism is bad but it's not just ignorance on that there's a Pew poll that came out yesterday that really is quite astonishing in in its ramifications so this is this is what the poll shows it's assessments on whether life is better or worse than it was 50 years ago and it shows what people think in various countries so the very bottom of the list of course is Venezuela where people are eating dogs but the very top of the list is Vietnam where they say 88% say it's better than it was 50 years ago that makes sense in 1967 we're in the middle of Vietnam War so things were pretty bad at that point and the Vietcong took over and that was pretty bad too Vietnam has opened up a fair bit since then India is number two on the list of places that are better off than they were 50 years ago these are obviously countries that understand that that economic development matters right South Korea Japan Germany Turkey Turkey's an interesting one because 50 I'm not sure honest to be honest with you where Turkey was fifty years ago but in recent years they've obviously slipped and then you have the Netherlands Sweden Poland Spain a lot of countries that are from the former Soviet bloc so where is the United States here where is the United States when it comes to our people better off or worse off than they were 50 years ago this is an amazing statistic only 37% of Americans say that Americans are better off today than they were 50 years ago 41% of Americans say that they are worse off than they were 50 years ago 50 years ago in 1967 in the middle of riots in the United States in the middle of the Vietnam War with economic element that you know having a car was was a having a nice car was still a luxury you know where you didn't have the Internet you didn't have the houses were smaller air conditioning was still not universal central air central heating right there weren't such a thing as computers the living standard in the United States is so much higher than it was in 1967 and yet Americans believe that this is not the case that they are they were better off then and this is one of the problems I think in American politics right now there's this sort of nostalgia for a better time there was no better time I've said this before you are living in the best time in history okay this is the better time when people say do when you wish you had lived right now you know why because I can connect with any piece of information on the planet at any time of night or day hey I can go to the grocery store and I can get any delicacy I want from anywhere on planet Earth I can live in a bigger house if I can pay for it and I can pay for it right this is one of the beautiful things about living in the United States things have gotten incredibly better but people refuse to recognize this and so instead you ends up with this weird perception that things have gotten worse and if you think things have gotten worse you end up in desperate straits cuz if you think things are constantly getting bad then every election you're one step from the end of the country every election is the end of the road you can't have a forward-looking view where you say yeah Obama was garbage she was a bad president if you're on the right but guess what the country didn't collapse and that means that we can actually build a movement and move the country towards something even more glorious instead every election becomes the be-all end-all you see the same thing from Democrats we're one election from Armageddon if you always think you're one election from Armageddon you're actually bringing Armageddon closer talking about how Armageddon is right around the corner makes people act as though Armageddon is right around the corner and if you act as the Armageddon is right around the corner it probably is by the way life expectancy in the United States in 1967 at points of birth was 71 years today life expectancy in the United States is 79 years on that basis alone life is significantly better in the United States than it was 50 years ago I mean especially for minorities he kidding me like black people in 1967 versus black people in 2017 are you out of your mind to think that things were better in 1967 there were literal race riots in Detroit in 1967 hey you really if you were gay in 1967 you better off now or better in 1967 if you're Jewish hey this is all it's all it's all nonsense but but unfortunately we have a tendency to to be pessimists about reality and this leads us some down some dark roads and toward a nostalgia on one side that says that we can rectify everything with big government and the style on the other side that says that we have to freeze everything in place west unless we fall into the abyss
