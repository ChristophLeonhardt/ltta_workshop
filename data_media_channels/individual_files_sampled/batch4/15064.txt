Canadian cowardice on full display its United Nations our UN Ambassador has abstained from a vote to declare Trump's recognition of Israel's capital null and void the United Nations just voted 128 to 9 to nullify President Donald Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's undivided capital shamefully Canada joined the course of 35 Coward countries who abstained from the vote Canada's Foreign Affairs Department issued a bland non-committal statement saying we are disappointed that this resolution is one-sided and does not advance prospects for peace to which we aspire which is why we have abstained from today's votes unreal prospects for peace you say can anybody tell me what sort of prospects for peace that were before Jerusalem was recognized as the capital the stabbings and terror attacks are getting pretty routine around there they were routine before they are still routine now and they will remain routine as long as Israel's neighbors are committed to pushing it into the sea as a matter of their public policy this latest General Assembly vote comes on the heels of a United Nations Security Council vote to do basically the exact same thing to try to render the United States recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel null and void that vote was 14 to 1 vetoed by United States ambassador to the United Nations nikki Haley just watched this with those in favor of the draft resolution contained in document s / 2017 / 1:06 0 please raise their hand thank you will those against thank you no abstentions the result of the voting is as follows 14 votes in favor one vote against do you know what was really weird about that vote Russia has already formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel yet as a member of the Security Council they just voted to squash the United States doing the very same thing to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital this is the sort of ridiculous hypocritical anti-american for the sake of being anti-american garbage that goes on at the United Nations imagine the audacity of the UN both the Security Council and the General Assembly thinking they have the authority to tell a sovereign nation like the United States where they can put their own embassy and then thinking that they have also the authority to tell a sovereign nation like Israel where their capital is it's absolutely everything that is wrong with being part of the United Nations they spent a lot of time focusing on liberal democracies who actually respect human rights while populating the Human Rights Council with the very worst of the worst human rights abusers around the world anyway ambassador haley sent a letter to the United Nations General Assembly Member States she warned them that if they voted in a similar motion in a similar fashion against the United States that the United States would level financial consequences on those countries maybe even withholding foreign aid which is of course absolutely reasonable why would the United States or any civilized nation for that matter fund countries who are acting against their best interests how is this even a controversial position to take so after the vote I guess the United States just got 128 UN member-states richer if Donald Trump follows through on his plan to cut off anyone who votes against the United States at the United Nations and Donald Trump's track record of following through and his promises is getting pretty darn good now liberals often say there are really no Shari Canadian values but I wholeheartedly reject that we are the country of bravery in the face of overwhelming evil and often what seems like imminent defeat we are not a nation and have never been a nation that sits on her hands when called upon to do the right thing we have never been Switzerland and we've always stood by our closest allies and fought for what's right right beside them we are a country that has always punched above our weight in ways and enduring times I think the liberal left would love to rewrite out of our history books we are the country of bravery at Kitchener's would regina trench Juno Beach the Battle of Hong Kong cap young medic pocket and Kandahar but today we abandoned two of our closest allies Israel and the United States and not even in battle but in a bureaucratic vote in the safety of an auditorium when called upon to recognize the autonomy of two of our closest historical friends on the face of planet Earth Justin Trudeau's Canada could not do the right thing the brave thing even if it's unpopular we've gone from Stephen Harper telling Israel through fire and water Canada will stand with you too Trudeau's sorry bro not today and it seems as though our politicians were very concerned about the optics of looking like we were too close to chummy with the United States it's more important to Trudeau to be anti-trump than it is to be ethical could you imagine being concerned about the optics of doing the right thing or being too close to the world's largest super power that's Canada's foreign policy right now it's not moral and it's certainly not principled Canada's foreign policy is basically a facebook meme about cats at this point boring safe worried about likes and shares and not hurting anyone's feelings we're cute Canada is a tumblr blog post if a tumblr blog post could be a country all we do is virtue signaling and talk about how special in different we are while never really doing anything at all for the rebel media I'm Sheila Gunn read Canadian conservatives have always stood shoulder to shoulder with our allies in Israel and I think it should be official conservative party policy to move our embassy to Jerusalem if you agree with me you can sign our petition at move the embassy dot CA you
