Nicolás Maduro has
overseen Venezuela’s worst
economic disaster
in recent times.
Nine out of 10 people here
can’t afford
enough food to eat.
And yet he was re-elected
by a landslide.
Few signs point to anything
getting better here,
so how will he be able to run
this country?
To answer this,
let’s look back and
see how he was elected.
It’s the day before the
presidential election,
and I’m here in a
leaky basketball court
in a neighborhood that
voted heavily for Maduro
in the last election.
There’s no stump
speeches, no candidates,
no flags for any party.
But there are eggs
and frozen chickens
subsidized by the government.
Maduro’s campaign has
been widely criticized
for dangling food in front
of the poor in exchange
for votes.
Brigid is a Maduro
party supporter,
a community leader in charge
of food distribution for 100
or so families in the barrio.
This isn’t new.
Handing out food and promising
benefits have been popular
“get out the vote” tactics here
since Hugo Chávez’s time.
What is new is the
level of desperation.
Maduro has turned this need
into a not-so-subtle pitch:
“I give and you give.”
Now it’s the morning
of the election
and Maduro supporters
are out in force.
This neighborhood has been hit
hard by the economic crisis
and you still have die-hard
supporters of the president
turning out the vote.
For years now,
they’ve benefited from this
party’s welfare system.
Yasmín is a community leader.
She’s going around the barrio
knocking on doors, making
sure people vote for Maduro.
Some here don’t blame the
president for their hunger.
They blame the U.S.
Others don’t buy that line.
But Maduro’s critics don’t
have many other choices.
He’s already banned or jailed
his most popular rivals.
If anything, this
election seemed
to be about perfecting
a system in which
his party always wins.
Not 50 yards away from
the voting station
is a punto rojo, or a red station,
the color of 
Maduro’s party.
They're writing down the number
of your benefit card,
what’s called the
Fatherland Card,
to make sure that you voted,
and promising a special bonus
if Maduro is re-elected.
A hungry country
should be a weakness.
But in this election,
it was Maduro’s strength
because his government
owns the food.
Is this how it’s going
to be from now on?
Walking around the
streets of Caracas
it feels like we’ve
passed a crossroads,
one where the president had
everything going against him,
and yet he still wins.
