KOREAN WAR TO STEP FOOT IN

AT THE NORTH KOREAN LEADER,

20
00:00:32,848 --> 00:00:35,283
ACCORDING TO EXPERTS WE SPOKE TO

21
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:37,519
IN OUR OWN OBSERVATION, THIS IS

22
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:40,922
THE FIRST TIME SHE'S BEEN ON THE

23
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:42,958
INTERNATIONAL, LIVE STAGE.

24
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,759
AT THE END OF SEVERAL LONG

25
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,494
SESSIONS, THE TWO LEADERS ENDED

26
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:48,396

TIME FRAME FOR THIS OR OTHER

30
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:54,403
SPECIFICS.

31
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:55,137
LIKEWISE, THERE WAS A DRAMATIC

32
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:58,940

00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,708
END THE KOREAN WAR.

34
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,310
AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST, THAT

35
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,747
COULD INVOLVE A LOT OF HAGGLING.

36
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:08,950
THIS IS ALL A VERY GOOD WARM-UP

37
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,252

00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:12,120

00:01:16,458 --> 00:01:17,292
ALLOWING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO CUT

41
00:01:17,292 --> 00:01:18,360
TO THE CHASE.

42
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,594
THE WHITE HOUSE, LIKE A WEEK,

43
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:20,929

44
00:01:20,929 --> 00:01:21,997

45
00:01:21,997 --> 00:01:26,234

00:01:48,557 --> 00:01:49,558
CAN'T TRUST THESE PEOPLE.
