00:02:19,885 --> 00:02:21,987
HAD A FROSTY RELATIONSHIP WITH

79
00:02:21,987 --> 00:02:22,687
ANGELA MERKEL.

80
00:02:22,687 --> 00:02:24,623
SHE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE, A

81
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:25,257
WORKING RELATIONSHIP.

82
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,925
ONE WE WOULD EXPECT TO BE SORT

83
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:28,326
OF LIKE WHAT WE'LL SEE AGAIN

84
00:02:28,326 --> 00:02:29,528
THIS WEEK WHEN THE TWO LEADERS

85
00:02:29,528 --> 00:02:32,063

86
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:34,900

I THINK EVERY LEADER IS

97
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:51,216
DIFFERENT AND EVERY

98
00:02:51,216 --> 00:02:51,883
RELATIONSHIP IS DIFFERENT.

99
00:02:51,883 --> 00:02:53,585
THE IMPORTANT PART IS THE

100
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:56,488
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

101
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:59,124
