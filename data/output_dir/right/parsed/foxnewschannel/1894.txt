ACCORDING TO SOURCES, THAT WE
HAVE HEARD FROM TONIGHT.
>> Bret: WE WILL FOLLOW THAT,
JOHN ROBERTS LIVE ON THE NORTH
LAWN, THANK YOU.
ISRAEL SAID IT STRUCK DOZENS OF
IRANIAN MILITARY TARGETS IN
SYRIA OVERNIGHT ON WHAT APPEARS
TO BE THE MOST INTENSE FIGHTING
BETWEEN THE TWO MIDDLE EASTERN
RIVALS IN 45 YEARS.
A BIG STORY.
BENJAMIN HALL IS IN JERUSALEM
NEWSROOM WITH AN UPDATE.
>> THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE DAMASCUS
LIT UP LAST NIGHT AS ISRAEL
LAUNCHED ITS BIGGEST AIR
OPERATION SINCE THE 1973
YOM KIPPUR WAR, TARGETING
URANIAN FACILITIES IN SYRIA.
THE MASSIVE OPERATION SAW 50
SITES HE HAD TO.
IRAN'S MILITARY INFRASTRUCTURE
IN SYRIA INCLUDING INTELLIGENT
SITES, LOGISTICS HEADQUARTERS,
MILITARY COMPOUNDS, AND
WAREHOUSES.
THE ATTACKS CAME AFTER IRANIAN
GUARD LAUNCHED 20 ROCKETS AND
ISRAELI TROOPS INSIDE.
THE FIRST TIME IRAN HAS DIRECTLY
TARGETED ISRAELI FORCES.
>> IRAN CAUSED THE REDLINE.
OUR REACTIONS WERE ACCORDING TO
IT.
TO SPEAK OF THE ROCKETS WERE ALL
INTERCEPTED OR FELL SHORT.
BUT NEVERTHELESS, THIS WAS A
MAJOR ESCALATION BY IRAN, ISRAEL
HAS ALWAYS SAID THAT IT WOULD
NEVER ALLOW IRAN TO SET UP
PERMANENT PERMANENT MILITARY
BASES, BUT THEY HAVE DONE JUST
THAT BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE
CHAOS OF THE CIVIL WAR.
THEY SAID THE RESPONSE WAS
WORDED.
>> IF IT RAINS IN OUR COUNTRY,
IT WILL POUR THERE.
I HOPE THAT WE HAVE FINISHED
WITH THIS AND THAT EVERYBODY
UNDERSTOOD.
>> TONIGHT THERE IS AN UNEASY
PEACE, MILITARY REINFORCEMENTS
HAVE BEEN MOVED TO THE NORTH OF
ISRAEL, BUT THE PRESIDENT SPOKE
TO ANGELA MERKEL AND SAID THAT
HE DOES NOT WANT AN ESCALATION
EITHER.
THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT HAS
DISTANCED ITSELF FROM THE ROCKET
ATTACK, ALTHOUGH SOME SYRIAN
FELLOW CIVILITIES WERE USED.
EUROPEAN SOURCES SAY THAT THE
MONEY USE THEM WITHOUT
PERMISSION.
IF THE SYRIANS HAD BEEN
INVOLVED, ISRAEL HAVE MADE HIT
THEM TOO.
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU WAS IN MOSCOW
VISITING VLADIMIR PUTIN, THOUGHT
THAT HE WAS GOING TO PERSUADE
HIM TO PREVENT SYRIAN ALLIES
FROM ATTACKING ISRAEL.
IT APPEARS THAT THIS HAS NOT
WORKED.
>> AND THERE HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD
INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL
STRACK AGAINST IRAN AND SYRIA.
