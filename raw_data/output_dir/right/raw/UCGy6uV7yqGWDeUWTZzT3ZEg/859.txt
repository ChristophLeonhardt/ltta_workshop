<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah those are excellent points and it's</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">very sad but in general I think one</font>

74
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,299
particular point<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was very</font>

75
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">distressing was the fact that they were</font>

that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> judge has pointed out is that</font>

81
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,579
the appeal was out of time in the sense

82
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seems pretty clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

83
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,970
they missed at filing<font color="#CCCCCC"> deadline for the</font>

84
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,909
appeal but the problem was if the court

letting<font color="#E5E5E5"> him see his lawyers and it</font>

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,299
becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> very hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to file</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that appeal on</font>

89
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,639
time in the first place<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's</font>

90
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,230
there's some very profound questions

91
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,090
about whether justice has even remotely

92
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,200
been done so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far in this case</font>

93

94
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,530
came clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me is just how how hard</font>

95
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,019
Tommy's sentence has been solitary

96
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,349

98
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,620
had a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours but the sense I'm</font>

99
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,209
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> from looking at the judges</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">there's three a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three-judge panel</font>

101
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:32,609
I think Dame<font color="#E5E5E5"> McGowan one of the judges</font>

111
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:55,229
doubt they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will they may overturn the</font>

his sentence is overly long<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's my</font>

118

hunch if I had to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> something at 12:00</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">noon here yeah I think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly</font>

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,228
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the problem with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

121
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canterbury appeal is that it really is</font>

122
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,010
clearly very late like it's over a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

123
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,599
since that suspended sentence was handed

124
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,010
down so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the judges are</font>

125
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to disturb that but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

126
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:25,770
right I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're gonna see the</font>

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">fundamental</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> injustice</font>

the Leeds<font color="#E5E5E5"> Crown Court and I think</font>

130
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,070
they'll either quash that<font color="#CCCCCC"> sentence or</font>

131

substantially reduce it well it's nice
