1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:19,120
Would you characterize yourself as pro-life,
pro-choice, both, or neither?

2
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,960
Uh...Both?

3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,860
Can you explain that?

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:31,400
I wouldn't, but I can't choose for other people.
That's kind of what we are as America, is

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,140
you know, letting people have their freedom.

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,820
I'm Christian, so I'm what do you call it
-- pro-life. It's a life you're taking. It's

7
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,360
really considered murder. The baby has a fetal
heartbeat. The baby's alive. So I think when

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,589
a baby gets a heartbeat, that should be the
cut off point. That's just my stance. I'm

9
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:00,390
not the kind of guy -- like, I want everyone
to follow my stance. All these laws that are

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,340
making it more difficult for women to get
an abortion, I think that's crazy.

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,260
They should have all legal rights to have
an abortion. It's our own rights. It's freedom.

12
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:16,820
That's a human being's body so I think they
have a right to have control over they body.

13
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,640
I think in situations where the woman had
â€“ where it can be proved that the woman

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,750
had control over the situation, they should
not be allowed to abort the baby because they

15
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,259
were part of that conscious decision. I would
characaterize myself as pro-life.

16
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:34,240
I think that by making it illegal, it makes
it more dangerous for women in the world.

17
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,540
I identify as pro-choice.

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,440
I was brought up Catholic. If you're a Christian,
then, you would let people do what they wanna do,

19
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,780
you would be able to understand. I would
say pro-choice.

20
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,080
If I had to pick, I would say that I'm....
pro-choice? But personally I'm more on a...

21
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,340
somewhere in the middle.

22
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,900
I don't want to discuss anything like that.

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,920
I don't want to go there.

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,640
Probably pro-life.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
This life that you're taking
out of the world probably could be something

26
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,040
better, or more famous, or bigger than you
could ever even imagine. This is probably

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,040
the next president. But if you don't allow
them to get an abortion, you best believe

28
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,100
they're going to find a way to abort it themselves.
I've seen it.

29
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,280
It should be illegal but, it's a fifty-fifty
on that.

30
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,300
It really is. Like there's some good

31
00:03:00,340 --> 00:00:00,000
points, there's some pros and cons.
