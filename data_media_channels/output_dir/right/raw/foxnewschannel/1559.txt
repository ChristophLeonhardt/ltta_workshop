1
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:07,568
MEETING MIGHT NOT HAPPEN IN JUN

2
00:00:07,568 --> 00:00:07,868
JUNE.

3
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:09,803
>> Lawrence: WE SHOULD HAVE

4
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:11,705
ASSUMED THAT WHEN THESE

5
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:12,373
CONVERSATIONS FIRST STARTED,

6
00:00:12,373 --> 00:00:14,241
LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF

7
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:16,043
THE SHOW, KIM IS SO

8
00:00:16,043 --> 00:00:16,510
UNPREDICTABLE.

9
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,946
BUT AGAIN, THIS IS SUCH A FLUID

10
00:00:18,946 --> 00:00:19,313
SITUATION.

11
00:00:19,313 --> 00:00:20,047
THIS IS WHY PART OF MY PROBLEM

12
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:23,317
IS THAT I HATE THAT WE ARE

13
00:00:23,317 --> 00:00:24,619
HAVING THIS NEGOTIATION BETWEEN

14
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:25,753
DONALD TRUMP, KIM JONG UN, AND

15
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:27,455
THE PRESS BECAUSE THEY WERE SO

16
00:00:27,455 --> 00:00:28,189
MANY MOVING PARTS AND THIS BACK

17
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:31,692
AND FORTH.

18
00:00:31,692 --> 00:00:32,293
>> Harris: THERE’S ALSO

19
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:33,261
PROPAGANDA.

20
00:00:33,261 --> 00:00:33,928
I DON’T MISS IT.

21
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,097
KIM JONG UN WAITED UNTIL THE

22
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:38,232
DATE WAS SET AND THE LOCATION

23
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:40,702
WAS SET FOR HIM TO SAY MAYBE I’M

24
00:00:40,702 --> 00:00:42,804
NOT GOING TO CELEBRATE

25
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:44,973
DISMANTLING AND MAYBE I’M NOT

26
00:00:44,973 --> 00:00:45,673
GOING TO DENUCLEARIZE AND YOU

27
00:00:45,673 --> 00:00:47,041
CAN’T TELL ME THAT THAT MAN

28
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:47,742
DOESN’T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

29
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:50,078
MEETING OF THAT WORD IS.

30
00:00:50,078 --> 00:00:51,880
>> Sandra: WHILE HE REFUSES TO

31
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,647
SAY WHETHER THERE ARE CONDITIONS

32
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:56,084
FOR THIS NORTH KOREAN MEETING,

33
00:00:56,084 --> 00:00:59,287
AND AS I SAID, HE WOULD LIKE THE

34
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:00,155
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE

35
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:03,658
PENINSULA TO BE "ALL IN ONE," HE

36
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:05,727
CANNOT GUARANTEE KIM’S SAFETY.

37
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:07,162
HE CAN GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL

38
00:01:07,162 --> 00:01:07,495
BE RICH.

39
00:01:07,495 --> 00:01:10,966
IF IT WORKS OUT.

40
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:12,667
>> Katie: SO THEY ARE TRYING

41
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:13,635
TO REASSURE KIM JONG UN THAT HE

42
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:16,271
WILL BE ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS

43
00:01:16,271 --> 00:01:17,673
REGIME EVEN IF THEY

44
00:01:17,673 --> 00:01:19,207
DENUCLEARIZING BECAUSE HIS

45
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,209
ENTIRE PREMISE OF HIS OWN

46
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,213
NEGOTIATION REQUIRE THAT HE KEEP

47
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:25,848
HIS NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH THE

48
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:27,082
ABILITY TO PRESERVE HIS REGIME.

49
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,051
AND HE HAS LOOKED AT THINGS THAT

50
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:29,751
HAVE HAPPENED AROUND THE WORLD

51
00:01:29,751 --> 00:01:33,655
OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS.

52
00:01:33,655 --> 00:01:36,291
JOHN BOLTON’S COMMENTS ABOUT

53
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,794

54
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:39,495
