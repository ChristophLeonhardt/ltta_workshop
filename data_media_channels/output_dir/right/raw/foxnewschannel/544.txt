THAT WORK?

75
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,138
>> THERE'S MEETINGS AND

76
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:34,107
TRAININGS THAT LET YOU KNOW WHAT

77
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:36,342
TO DO, WHAT NOT TO DO.

78
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:37,310
THINGS LIKE THAT.

79
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:41,481
SO IT'S VERY ORGANIZED, AND IT'S

80
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:44,150
VERY GOOD TO BE WITH EVERYONE.

81
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,951
>> Laura: WHAT YOU DO FOR A

82
00:02:44,951 --> 00:02:46,519
LIVING WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING

83
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:46,820

86
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:52,525
WHAT A BRETT KAVANAUGH DO NOT

87
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:52,926
LIKE?

88
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:54,060
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM?

89
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,729
>> I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

90
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:57,530
PERSONALLY AGAINST HIM.

91
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,865
I JUST THINK THIS IS A BAD LOOK

92
00:02:58,865 --> 00:02:59,265
FOR AMERICA.

93
00:02:59,265 --> 00:03:04,103
I THINK THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN

94
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:04,504
FORTHCOMING.

95
00:03:04,504 --> 00:03:05,605
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE NEED

96
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:07,540

97
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,276

>> Laura: I CLERKED FOR

99
00:03:11,144 --> 00:03:11,611
CLARENCE THOMAS.

100
00:03:11,611 --> 00:03:14,380
IF YOU KNEW HIM, HE WOULD LOVE

101
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,949
HIM.

102
00:03:15,949 --> 00:03:16,616
HE'S A GREAT PERSON.

103
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:18,718
>> I'M PRETTY SURE HE IS A GREAT

104
00:03:18,718 --> 00:03:18,985
GUY.

105
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,120

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,587
CONVINCE TRIANA.

107
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:23,723

SEGMENT, I'M CONVINCING YOU

109
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,759
BECAUSE TRIANA IS TOO COOL.

110
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,394
SHE HAS 12 KIDS SHE'S RAISED

111
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:29,662
WITH HER HUSBAND, EIGHT BOYS --

112
00:03:29,662 --> 00:03:32,365
>> EIGHT BOYS, FOCAL GIRLS.

113
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:34,768
>> THEY SHOULD TAKE CARE OF HER

114
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:35,068
HOTEL.

115
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:36,703
>> Laura: WHAT THE HECK?

116
00:03:36,703 --> 00:03:37,370
TAKE CARE OF TRIANA.

117
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,407
>> I DIDN'T KNOW --

118
00:03:40,407 --> 00:03:41,741
>> Laura: I THINK THEY GOT A

119
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,544
LITTLE HELP FOR THE HOTEL ROOM.

120
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:46,513
>> GEORGE SOROS, IT'S NOT

121
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:46,913
SURPRISING.

122
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:49,349
GEORGE SOROS PAID FOR THE FAKE

123
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:50,116
DOSSIER.

124
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,951
GLENN SIMPSON AND FUSION GPS.

125
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:53,386
SO HE'S CONNECTED THROUGHOUT ALL

126
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:54,154
OF THE LEFT-WING ACTIVITIES IN

127
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:55,722
THIS COUNTRY AND AROUND THE

128
00:03:55,722 --> 00:03:56,022
WORLD.

129
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:56,723
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME.

130
00:03:56,723 --> 00:03:59,025
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, MAYBE

131
00:03:59,025 --> 00:04:00,360
A LITTLE CONSISTENCY FROM THESE

132
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,760
PROTESTERS.

133
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,729
MAYBE THEY CAN GO OUT AND TALK

134
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:05,399
ABOUT CORY BOOKER AS A GROVER OR

135
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,434
MAYBE THEY CAN TALK ABOUT

136
00:04:07,434 --> 00:04:08,902
KEITH ELLISON BATTERING HIS

137
00:04:08,902 --> 00:04:10,270
GIRLFRIEND OR MAY BE

138
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,004
SENATOR CARPER FROM DELAWARE WHO

139
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:14,207
BEAT HIS WIFE, MAYBE WE CAN HAVE

140
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:15,409
A CONVERSATION THAT'S A LOT

141
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:18,879
BIGGER THAN JUST SOME UNFOUNDED,

142
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,079
QUITE HONESTLY, WITH NO

143
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,183
EVIDENCE, TO BACK IT UP, NO

144
00:04:23,183 --> 00:04:28,488
CORROBORATION, NO WITNESSES,

145
00:04:28,488 --> 00:04:29,122
AGAINST BRETT KAVANAUGH.

146
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:29,823
THESE SAME DEMOCRATIC SENATORS

147
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,425
ARE SAYING THAT HE IS GUILTY

148
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:32,059
UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT.

149
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,660
THAT IS NOT HOW WE ARE SUPPOSED

150
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,228
TO DO THIS.

151
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,362
>> Laura: SOME OF THE CRIMINAL

152
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:37,130
JUSTICE.THAT IS BEING DONE FROM

153
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:37,865
A PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MOVING ON

154
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:41,935
THIS ISSUE, I THINK THEY ARE

155
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:42,603
ACTUALLY MAKING INTERESTING

156
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:43,937
COALITIONS WITH MINORITY GROUPS

157
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:44,938
AND OTHERS, WHO NORMALLY DON'T

158
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:45,672
LOOK AT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN

159
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:48,108
A VERY CHARITABLE WAY.

160
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:48,909
BUT PART OF WHAT IS BRINGING

161
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,577
THEM TOGETHER IS THIS IDEA THAT

162
00:04:50,577 --> 00:04:54,482
PROSECUTORS ARE OVERZEALOUS AND

163
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:55,883
ARE CONVICTING PEOPLE WHO REALLY

164
00:04:55,883 --> 00:04:57,652
DON'T HAVE A SHOT THAT EITHER

165
00:04:57,652 --> 00:04:58,252
DEFENDING THEMSELVES OR

166
00:04:58,252 --> 00:04:59,153
CONVICTING THEM BEFORE THEY HAVE

167
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:01,489
REALLY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT

168
00:05:01,489 --> 00:05:03,591
ON THE KIND OF EVIDENCE THEY

169
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:04,091
NEED TO.

170
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:04,859
SO IT'S INTERESTING THESE GROUPS

171
00:05:04,859 --> 00:05:07,128
ARE TURNING ON --

172
00:05:07,128 --> 00:05:10,464
>> THERE'S A BACKLASH COMING.

173
00:05:10,464 --> 00:05:11,198
>> Laura: HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

174
00:05:11,198 --> 00:05:13,334
JEFFREY LORD, YOU HAVE

175
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:16,103
EXPERIENCE IN THIS BECAUSE OF

176
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:18,239
YOUR WORK IN ANOTHER JUDICIAL

177
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,340
CONFIRMATION THAT INVOLVED A

178
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:19,974
SIMILAR TYPE OF SWARM.

179
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:22,910
TELL US ABOUT IT.

180
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:24,479
>> YES, YES.

181
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,049
MY BEST FRIEND FROM COLLEGE'S

182
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:28,883

CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS.

185
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:35,823
HE WAS THE REAGAN CHIEF COURT OF

186
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:38,092
THE WESTERN DISTRICT IN 2001

187
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,695
PART WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH 43

188
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:42,430
PICKED THEM TO GO TO THE THIRD

189
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:42,997
