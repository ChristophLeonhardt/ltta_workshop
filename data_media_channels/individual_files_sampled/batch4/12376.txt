you know a few months ago I told you that if congressional conservatives didn't pass the crappy Trump care bill that Donald Trump was gonna start making deals with Democrats you sent me angry letters now it's happened get ready to send me more angry letters because I'm gonna tell you what is going to happen next also we have the mighty Victor Davis Hanson here to discuss the Left attack on our history but first former presidential candidate and socialist nudnik Bernie Sanders has published a new book for young adults I know what you're thinking you're thinking oh that Andrew Clavin he's so funny and creative those wacky hilarious ideas he comes up with they just make me laugh and laugh but no I'm actually not making this up 75 year-old Sanders a man who spent his honeymoon in the Soviet Union because he just can't get sexy unless he's surrounded by bread lines and gulags has decided to spread the wisdom of socialism to a new generation of ignoramuses and suckers with a book entitled Bernie Sanders guide to political revolution in an interview with anyone who would still talk to him Sanders said quote I wanted to reach out to all those little whippersnappers with their gizmos and whatnots to pull them away from their bebop music and sock hops long enough to explain to them why socialism is really keen unquote in one chapter called everything you have belongs to me Sanders writes quote why dagnabbit you young people today have this dang fool notion that if you work for something you should be able to keep it why in my day a fellow understood that all the money you make actually belongs to the state because the state knows how to use it better than you do so just don't be such smart alecks and think you know so much when you're still wet behind the ears you darn rascals unquote in another chapter called socialism works in Scandinavia or someplace sanders writes quote you young bucks think you're so smart you think just because socialism destroyed the Soviet Union and transformed Venezuela into a hellhole that there's something wrong with it well believe me you me you good-for-nothing rapscallions socialism works just great and some of them their Scandinavian countries I've never been to and if I could remember the names of some of them why by cracky I'd cite some facts and here's about them to prove my point unquote the book was published at the end of August and has already generated some good Amazon reviews from its intended audience one review says quote I have never read a book before and found it hard because of all the words in it but now I know that socialism is the bomb unquote another review read quote speaking as a millennial which means I know absolutely nothing and yet still want to be taken seriously for some reason I just want to say yay socialism or like whatevs unquote reporters for the daily wire approached Sanders for an exclusive interview about the book but Sanders shouted at us from his porch quote get off my property you dadgum juvenile delinquents what do you think this is a socialist country unquote trigger warning I'm Andrew Clavin and this is the Andrew Clavin show see Topsy the Zipit easing its all right the Clavin this weekend is bearing down on Florida it's not looking good for Florida if they tell you to get out floridans get out you know do not be one of those guys who sits there and

they had the jacket of the book and it this story was the Andrew goes around town there it is nobody listens to everything the Andrew goes around telling people there's a bear in his bed and nobody listens to him but there actually is so months ago when they were fighting over the Trump care thing the Obamacare thing the Conservatives were standing in trumps way and I kept saying pass the bill it stinks it's a crap sandwich eat the crap sandwich I wrote an article called eat the crap sandwich and everybody was angry at me was writing in know our principles or principles and wince and that and my point then was the Trump is an unreliable operator if you are a conservative Trump has no ideology he wants to win he wants to get stuff done he wants to be loved he wants to do all this stuff you know you know what a dead metaphor as a metaphor is a metaphor you so often you don't even think about it anymore like the leg of a chair is a dead metaphor because it's actually not a leg or like we have legs but his leg of a chair is like a leg so it's a metaphor so the metaphor died we often say bull in a china shop and we don't think about that anymore but think about that image for a minute a bull goes into a china shop just running around crashing things because Trump has no ideology because he is governed mostly by self considerations but also the consideration that can be helpful that he wants to get things done you got to ride the bull if you ride the bull you're not going to get what you want but some of the stuff you break in the china shop will be stuff you want broken and the Republicans fell off the bull they fell off the bull when they didn't give Trump a win on Obamacare and they said oh well we want this we want that they didn't understand see this is the way that some right-wing talk radio turns us into children all right it turns us into children like we lost the election when Trump won the primary if you are a philosophical conservative a small government cut the debt you know reform entitlement conservative let me be free give me my freedom get out of my way conserve lost the election when Trump won the primary now is Trump better than Hillary a thousand times better than Hillary but it's possible that and would anybody else have won I don't think so it is entirely possible that Trump is the very best thing that we could have gotten and not that great those two things are not in conflict with one another that's the tragic view of life that's the tragic fact of life and when guys go on the radio and they pound their hands they with their fists and they tell you no stricter you can't compromise you got to get what you want that is that's baby too when they talk about good and evil and they're talking about you know Donald Trump in the Congress or or even Barack Obama you know I used to say people would say Obama's evil let's say that's not evil that's not what evil looks like you know and they would say well he does this he does that look these are little boy words of good and evil and heroes and villains it's not that there's no such thing as good and evil there is it's not there's no such thing as heroes and villains there are but most of the time you don't find that stuff in American government what you find is a bunch of clowns banging off each other doing stuff for their own egos trying to keep their jobs playing off their constituency lying that to their constituency to get get reelected that's the kind of stuff we're dealing with that's the real world Donald Trump is what he is he is not Ted Cruz and Ted Cruz wouldn't have won he wouldn't have won the election so Donald Trump maybe the best thing we could have gotten way way better than Hillary no question and still not that good so what what's what do you do you play the cards you're dealt that's what grown-ups do they play the cards they're dealt and the conservative caucus did not do that when they let Obamacare fly so what did Trump do Trump invited you know what a shock in Nancy is I not now he's gone Chuck and Nancy there they came in and he gave them he gave away the store a little bit he said to them he's going to extend he attached the debt ceiling to hurricane Harvey relief and said we will just extend the debt ceiling for three months now why is that why does that drive the Conservatives crazy because it means the Democrats have have a stranglehold on the debate in three months time when the Congress is gonna want to go home for Christmas that's gonna be December 15th and so they're gonna be have to be in a much much stronger position Trump himself when the Republicans did this before he was elected and they gave the extended the debt limit for four months he just said this is the worst deal in history this is a terrible terrible deal but now suddenly Trump is talking about you know the fact that we're happy they play cut cut number three the White House I had a great bipartisan meeting with Democrat and Republican leaders in Congress and I'm committed to working with both parties to deliver for our wonderful wonderful citizens it's about time we had a great meeting with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and the whole Republican leadership group and I'll tell you what we walked out of there Mitch and Paul and everybody Kevin and we walked out and everybody was happy not too happy because you could never be too happy but they were happy enough and it was nice to see that happen for a change that hasn't happened for a long time in this country for a very long time well Chuck Schumer was happy Chuck Schumer looked like I mean you know talk about dead metaphor look at he look like the cat who ate the canary play cup number six the president listened to the arguments we think we made a very reasonable and strong argument and to his credit he went with the better argument and just to just to finish off the picture mark Meadows the Conservatives all the Conservatives just look I mean but you days it was only a day before this happened Paul Ryan was saying what we're gonna get an 18-month extension we're gonna get you know when I really do this what are they gonna play politics with the debt ceiling when people are suffering in in Texas that's the Democrats of course they're gonna play politics the Democrats are united it's only the Conservatives who are at each other's throat it's only the Republicans I should say that are at each other's throats so just to finish off the picture here's Mark Meadows cut seven typical Washington DC kicked the can down the road negotiating with Democrats doesn't normally produce how standing reserved okay so what's the plan what happens now and what can conservatives get out of this because you know to just go on and on about how unreliable Trump is after a while it's like listen to yourself get the news you know you keep delivering the news you keep saying Trump is this Trump is that I don't know I keep saying this and people I get letters about this all the time I don't care about Trump Trump is a fascinating character he really is he's big he's he's you know interesting he's weird he also has been more conservative and was willing to be more conservative than I ever thought so I was you know when when he won the primary I thought okay I lost the primary that happens you lose in politics sometimes you lose you know let's see what we get we got more we bought were already getting more from Trump than I ever expected the thing about cutting regulations is real and I complained about this before Trump was even in the picture I was talking about how this is one of those boring subjects that nobody wants to talk about but it's a big deal Trump has changed the culture of the EPA from crazy hysterical environmentalist who want to destroy anybody who even touches a tree they would want to do things like in California where we exacerbate our drought conditions to save some fish that nobody cares about or some little thing we and we treat business as if it's a bad thing instead of a good thing Trump under Trump the EPA is paring back regulations people are the old EPA warriors are weeping and quitting and it is chained it will allow for growth it will allow for more business growth and we can still take care of the environment so he's really done some good things the Gorsuch thing was good and and you know they're all these guys you know we're gonna have Victor Davis Hanson on later later on and he is one of the same voices I love the people of National Review but all they do is they keep complaining then they keep saying oh you know you keep saying he's better than Hillary how long are you gonna say that it's true he's better than Hillary it's he's just not that good I mean is I don't understand why once you've defined the situation once you understand what you're dealing with stop complaining and deal play the cards you're dealt get what we want what do we want we want freedom we want less regulation we want less government craziness we want people to stop telling us we can use the bathrooms in our local school we want the government dialed back out of her life and we want the economy to do what an American economy does when people are left alone take off and that is what Trump is thinking about so Trump is looking now and by the way you know now they'll probably be he's signaling that there's going to be a daca regulation basically all that immigration reform and Coulter must be on the ceiling at this point because it's going to be all the immigration reform that Obama couldn't get through is going to get through under Trump because he's gonna start making deals with Democrats because the Conservatives stood on their sacred principles and didn't deal with the situation that was right in front of them they didn't say it called Trump for what he was and deal with him as what he is so what's Trump thinking about Trump is thinking about what he can get what he can get done because remember the Republicans have failed them they haven't done anything they make him look like a fool they make him look like he can't accomplish things he told everybody he was gonna win and win a win and he can't get any major legislation through everything he's doing that he's and he's done some good stuff it's all been done on his own so he wants tax reform so now he's out I guess he was in North Dakota wasn't it he was it makes a speech and he calls the Democrat senator Heidi Heitkamp who's kind of you know a blue dog she's voted for Trump I don't know about half the time but with Trump about half the time and he calls her up on stage and he's pitching tax reform senator Heitkamp senator come on up and I have to say they you are all in favor of tax cuts all right yes I won't come on up senator these are great people they work hard there for you a hundred percent and we just want their support because we need support you see that with what's happening in Congress nobody can get anything through Congress we need support so thank you senator senator Heitkamp everyone's saying what's she doing up here but I'll tell you what good woman and I think will have your support I hope will have your support and thank you very much senator thank you for coming up senators thank you thank you so now he's you know this is a guy who tax Mitch McConnell a tax Paul Ryan but then he's saying the Democrat senator who votes with him 50% of his time he attacks flake because flake attacked him so he fights back but he's giving props to the Democrats under he cuz she might vote with him on tax reform we don't even know yet really what tax reform looks like but but let's just talk for a second because I really want to get to Victor Davis Hanson let's just talk for a second about what we as conservatives can get what we can get is if he cuts taxes and does and dials back the corporate tax all this money that stayed out of the country because they didn't trust Obama because they were afraid of the regulations they were afraid of his anti business stances all that money comes coming pouring back in that's what he's counting on and the economy takes off why is that good because Trump is still a Republican and if things go go well there will be this happiness gas of a good economy going in and that means real Republicans we can start to weed out some of the RINO Republicans that we don't like and we have a shot at maybe getting Mike Pence in there after Donald Trump so that would be a good thing but you know it's going to be you're gonna be gritting your teeth a lot because there's gonna be a lot of deals with Democrats until unless and until the Republicans can get their act together and start coming around and giving strum the wins that he wants he doesn't care about ideology and he doesn't care about policy he just wants to win and be loved and be a successful president they gotta give him they got to play the cards they're dealt they got to play the cards of the deal all right some of you are out there I know you're looking for the meaning of life and some of you were looking for love I am usually

if you subscribe for a lousy 10 bucks a month subscribe for the year and it's only a lousy 100 bucks plus come on you get the leftist ears bumbler the leftist ears tumblr alright come on over to the daily wire.com alright figured we have victory Victor Davis Hanson the great vdh he's an American military historian former classics professor he is a scholar of ancient warfare and he's a former a farmer he actually has a farm in California he is a fellow at the Stanford University's Hoover Institution and the National Review Institute great writer terrific historian and has a new book called the second world wars which we will talk about as well Victor how you doing pretty good alright you for having me oh it's a pleasure it's good to see you you know you are one of the very few intellectuals who did not spend who has not spent your days picking on Donald Trump you have actually given him you basically see him as a phenomenon more than as a as a problem and you've actually given him you're the one voice really at the National Review that has kind of supported him what do you see that they don't well I live in the real world not that they don't but for me it was never Donald Trump in a mannequin good versus evil or you have to be perfect to be good it was Donald Trump versus Hillary Clinton right so I tried to get I tried to be empirical about it I just went through issue-by-issue illegal immigration regulations tax reform identity politics versus unity politics economic issues on energy development fracking deterrent foreign policy versus sort of neo isolationism and I and it was for me it was a proverbial no-brainer and then I asked myself are there personal flaws in Trump based on the standards we use to adjudicate Presidency's that would make him beyond the pale that is that would the messenger cancel out the message and although he did a lot of things and does a lot of things I don't approve Oh given what I know about the personal life or the even the semi public life of JFK or Bill Clinton or Richard Nixon or even people the sanctimonious nough sub Jimmy Carter everybody it's a flawed univer individual so I didn't think that the messenger count canceled out the message but I was in this most people did not agree with me either at National Review or where I work at the Hoover Institution so I have to confess it that view that I espouse was not persuasive at least in the groups that I have to work with I like to work with I should say ya know I'm I have the same experience I mean I just thought you you know as I've been saying this morning you play the cards you're dealt this is it is entirely possible that Trump is the best thing we could have gotten and not that great I mean that's just the tragic fact of life yeah when you're looking to Trump right now you're looking at the daka thing which may end up with basically the dreamers Act being enshrined in law you're looking at the deal he just made with the Democrats are you do you feel a sense of terrifying betrayal or are you pretty calm about it no I think that for if you prune away all the left and right-wing rhetoric the immigration debate always boiled down to if you had been here in the United States for a long period of time 2 to 5 years if you had never committed a crime if you were not on public assistance and you were willing to learn English and play by the rules and the government would say we're going to give you an amnesty not for citizenship but for a renewable green card and that would mean that's up to you most people under the 86 amnesties chose to be permanent green hold card card holders if you wanted to be a citizen and you would pay a fine and and it would be a little bit more elaborate but in exchange for that then the left would say we're going to have diverse mera Craddock and legal immigration probably at a reduced rate we're going to have strict border enforcement Iver probably a wall and this would be a one-time phenomenon and then the Mexican American and the Mexican National immigrant phenomenon would start to resemble the italian-american experience of the nineteen 1890s to 1930 in which the the formidable forces of the melting pot Emma C integration assimilation intermarriage would make it irrelevant your tribal affinities so if your name is Giuliani or your name is Cuomo nobody knows how you're going to vote but that's not what the Left wanted they wanted to change the American Southwest from red states to blew through demographic realities and so I don't think that Trump did anything that anybody on the right if you get an Coulter or Sean Hannity you just say prune away all the rhetoric if these people have met all of these conditions there's going to be a deal but the problem is always on the left because I don't think they're willing to make that deal I don't think they're willing to say let's have legal diverse Merrick Radek legal immigration let's build a wall and force the board or follow the law be constitutional and give up the idea that we can't change the American Southwest and to resemble California I don't think they'll do it and there's another psychological or maybe I should say a rational fallacy if the dreamers weren't all of our attention and they're making the argument that these are an exceptional group the left kids that deserve to be given an amnesty in a green card then de-facto by default they're saying that the other ten million are not they don't qualify they knew what they were doing as adults they may have engaged in identity theft or fraud every day that they were here just because to reside here illegally requires you to say things that are not true on paper or say thing but they don't get that so if we if property is gonna cut a deal on dreamers and what are this left gonna come back and do with the other ten or twelve million yeah well if you're expecting the intellectual integrity from the left I think yeah yeah hold your breath and yeah yeah you know one of the things that really does make Trump even at his war tolerable is the left has seems to have genuinely gone insane and one of the ways they have gone insane is this this assault on our history this thing about the Confederate status you wrote a brilliant piece about this for National Review what do you think they're trying to accomplish with this assault on Confederate statute well notice that they don't distinguish they don't say that a a good decent man like General James Longstreet was different than Nathan Bedford Forrest it's just all bad and all bad in August September 2017 but not all bad in 2016 or 2012 and all bad even though the majority of Americans are willing to you know that they can they can put up with a Confederate statue as more of most minorities poll that they can even blacks I think or forty five percent I say even only because they have a vested interest in this the given the the pernicious role of slavery so what is it about it's about identity politics it's about showing the majority culture that they can make rapid changes in the social cultural structure of the United States and that people will give in to them if they make life difficult if they boycott corporations if they get on the news if they cause violence so we have this propensity now that gay marriage can be a reasonable debate with good parties of genuine good interest and Barack Obama can decide in 2008 that he doesn't believe in it as he said he I think he's a Christian he said and he didn't think it but by 2012 that has accelerated so anybody who doesn't believe as Barack Obama did as a homophobe same thing with daca Barack Obama said on ten occasions as a constitutional lawyer I'm not a king I'm quoting directly I'm not a king I cannot do something that's unconstitutional by 2012 when he was up for reelection anybody who had the position of Barack Obama was a nativist a xenophobe and a racist and so here we are with the Confederates anybody that issue has gone from let's discuss it let's say that maybe we don't want Roger Taney who was the author Scot or maybe we don't want nathan bedford forrest without some type of plaque that explains the other side to them but we're not going to go do this with all of our our relics we're not gonna go tell Joan Baez we're going to not allow the night they drove Dixie gallon that you made a millions of dollars on and resurrected your career we're not going to play that anymore we're gonna ban Gone with the Wind so what we're gonna say Columbia University has to change its name because of Columbia Columbus so what I'm getting at long-winded as I am is that works we accelerate these issues by demonizing people and then we try to make the minority position the majority Pishin by fear and intimidation and what we're looking for is one one brave one intellectually honest politician since I'm not going to be intimidated I'm not gonna tear down on statute robert e lee I'm not going to boycott Gone with the Wind these are historical artifacts of time and space unique to them and I expect we're all adults and we can make the necessary contextualization as need as needed but we're all supposed to be children and then I'm to pause supposed to teach us how to act I have to ask there's one question I have to ask you before we talk about your book you know I always I always joke that because people have heard of the fall of Rome and they've heard of Hitler yes they always assumed that every historical event is somehow related to the fall of Rome or to Hitler but yeah but I have to say that watching our politics right now I am reminded sometimes of the fall of the Roman Republic the resurge the surging populism versus the paralyzed elite and they kind of just the entire atmosphere of the decayed institutions does that ever trouble you as a classicist knows more about it than me yeah it does not only the armed gangs and street fighting of the late Republic Milo's and Claudius and Cicero and Caesar and Anthony but even into the Imperial period during that transitional war Augustus and the first emperors we're trying to have a principle but if you read a novel like Petronius and Satyricon which is a it's a satire manners and what are these signs that an ancient Roman ceteris looks for in a decline of civilization one of the things he says is the the obsessions with food exotic food except the obsessions with very expensive purple dyed clothing among the elite the obsessions with the transgenderism and the obsessions with bragging on how much clout property influence you have the obsessions was saying they are no longer an Italian your tro Malky oh you're from the Mediterranean that's the wave of the future so we have all of these tribal politics sort of transgendered issues and it's not me saying it it's the ancient the ancient mind says that this is a long way from the agrarian simplicity of rural Italy and it's unfortunately as they say when people don't do muscular labor or they're not concretely tied to reality and they judge their worth by their title or their are their money or their fashion or their sexual identity or their particular tribe then you've got a big problem diversity of the ancient world is not an advantage it's never advantage in any society that I know it's an obstacle to be overcome in the Roman Imperial state and the United States are about the only two systems in the history of civilization that will be we're able to assimilate people yeah the Ottomans werden most people can't do it they don't want to try Japan feels it's got a great model and it has no desire to be like Germany right what what's the second world wars why is it called the second world wars your new book two reasons one is that I tried to show that the first year and a half that is September 2nd to 1939 to the invasion of Russia in June 22nd 1941 there were a series of wars that is the Polish war that the invasion of Norway the Danish war the invasion of the Low Countries the French war the Blitz the war against Greece and the yuccas lava except for the Blitz Hitler won every one every one of them and by June of 1941 he ruled a country an area the size of the present-day EU a little larger and the war was over everybody thought it was over he won and then he did something that nobody in his right mind ever had even contemplated they'd be he attacked his most loyal I should say neutral but really it was in partner the Soviet Union that had supplied him with twenty percent of his oil about fifty percent of his week and at that point what had been a small series of borders Wars and was not called World War two was still World War wasn't World War one even it was the Great War and border wars and then three events in 1941 the attack on Russia the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and Singapore Philippines and the declared Eckler a ssin of war by Japan Italy and Germany on the United States changed it into what was now for the first time basically almost two years over two years after the fighting now it was called the Second World War in England the world war two the United States and suddenly World War one became World War one no longer the great that was one reason the other is if it was so global we'd never seen a war underseas u-boats in the deserts twenty eight thousand mile feet above in the earth and a b-17 on a battleship in the resistance in front there were so many different theaters that were so complex and nobody who was fighting in Burma thought against the Japanese had any idea what the Bulgarians thought or if you were in China and you were fighting the Japanese you didn't think you were an ally of a Scottish guy and a destroyer trying to honey you boat it was just you were but it was there were so many different Wars it was hard to come unified you know it's a it's an amazing way to look at it the second world wars my military historian Victor Davis Hanson Victor thanks so much for coming on I hope you'll come back and it's it's always really a pleasure to talk to you thank you having for having me I'm very appreciate all right I'll talk to you again no way okay all right and stuff I like you know I'm gonna talk a little bit I've been catching up on movies you know this is this is a really interesting turning point in the movie business Hollywood has had one of the worst summers ever one of the worst labor days ever they didn't even release a new film on on Labor Day so many of their franchises Hollywood we're talking only we're talking about the movie business the movie business because there's still TV is really doing well streaming is really doing well Netflix has become a Titan but they've been living off franchises and sequels and alien transformers cars Smurfs Resident Evil underworld Wimpy Kid Xander and these all bomb Xander cage nut job Independence Day Ice Age Ninja Turtles divergent Huntsman Alice in Wonderland Inferno The Da Vinci Code and the Jack Reacher franchise they've all tanked every one of them and there's really nothing in the pipeline there's nothing coming in and with new things I mean even the Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do that well con you know I saw Kong the what Seagal Kong Skull Island which I really enjoyed Jay hey Jonathan hey told me not to see it so I missed it in the theater I've been taking it out of him all week because I really enjoyed it it's an old fashioned H rider Haggard type adventure John Goodman plays the scientist who's looking for a monster and he piggy backs on a military expedition into a lost island and they come into this Lost Island and of course they find King Kong and Samuel Jackson is leading the military exposition here's a scene where he goes up to John Goodman and says what's going on you are going to tell me everything I don't know I'm going to blow your head off monsters exist yesterday I was a crackpot but today you drop those charges to flush something out who are you ancient species on this earth long before mankind and if we keep our heads buried in the sand they will take it back my agency is known as monarch we specialized in the hunt for massive unidentified terrestrial organisms you knew that thing was out here I'm sorry for your men colonel I truly am get us home with proof so we can send the cavalry you know the funny thing you know what ruins this picture I mean it's really a good movie is very enjoyable it's got a good cast Tom Hiddleston who should be the new James Bond yeah brie Larson who's adorable it's got some good plot twists it's got great monster fights really entertaining you know what keeps it from being a great movie feminism I swear no I swear feminism has ruined more movies as almost as many movies as it's ruined lives brie Larson plays the girl that's her character that's why you have a girl in these things because men are better at killing monsters they're better at shooting things to better running through jungles screaming and throwing you know grenades and the people who want to see that movie are largely men brie Larson is the girl one of the things that you want from the girl is you want her to get rescued but because they can't do a girl who needs to get rescued she doesn't have to it doesn't have to be fearful she can be brave but she's got to be a little bit more she's gonna be a girl it's got to be a little bit more emotional a little bit more vulnerable than the hero can save her without that the hero has nothing to do and Tom Hiddleston goes through this picture he has a look on his face like you gave me a great set up scene so I'm a cool character and now I'm doing nothing I'm doing nothing and brie Larson's character doesn't make any sense and the whole con mythology is that Cong is basically represents raw masculinity being tamed by the eternal feminine it was Beauty killed the Beast that's the last line of the original King Kong and they try to get that scene in here but what is she she's just a guy and you know with the nice shape basically she's like a cute looking guy cuz he does the same thing as everything else feminism murder these movies because it takes away what stories are about stories are about men and women other movies I saw I saw King Arthur legend of the sword which got the worst reviews ever but actually is not that bad it's a Guy Ritchie film and you know he got rich he makes all those smart talking mom British gangster movies so he brought that aura to the King Arthur myth it's a lot of mythology I found after like about 20 minutes I was like I can't remember who's the good guy who's the bat you know I remember him I'm rooting for King Arthur but that said Jude Law is good he's always good she lost one of the great actors of the age but here's here's just a quick scene that the the black legs are the soldiers and they're hunting for a fugitive and they come to King Arthur who is not now a king he's basically a an errand boy running a whorehouse and so this is a scene from a guy ritchie film cast back into the King Arthur days what's going on what's going on with you've got some heat on your Arthur your name keeps coming up and what circles my mom so in circle I'm a black leg sorry Institute but what circles do you think a tummy story about a girl colou see a Viking called graybeard of some rebel graffiti dirty in these worlds are you writing a book tell me every detail we had a quiet word with a couple of Vikings ascent from the beginning the very beginning I woke up then well then I go dressed I went downstairs I saw the girls Lucy was missing where's Lucy she's a good girl a nice girl she works here then then being allowed to care a bit business with housekeeping other things that should be that's the support from the boats then then we hurt your jet trouble again last night I'm in the other spot which George King George angry George George the dragon me clear out the witch George our George the Chinese George come food you'll come through George it's a character in this story so it doesn't make any sense but it's like it is fun and scenes like that are great is basically a Guy Ritchie gangster film moved to Arthur age finally I wash alien covenant which is fine I you know the whole point of these sequels is you liked watching a monster rip his way out of a guy's chest in the original we'll do it again and that's basically what happens I don't really care about the mythology it's just a bunch of you know it's a bunch of scenes that are reminiscent of the old one kind of pumped up with the new special-effects pumped up with money it's fine it's fine but here is the scene that I want to talk about that will bring us to stuff I will bring us to stuff I like Michael Fassbender is the what do they call him an Android I guess and he's an Android and he plays twin Androids to androids good Android and bad Android and he's describing how this planet was wiped out and here's what he says nothing beside remains round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away iron 18:18 but of course it's not byron it's Shelly and that is it's personally by Shelly the Ozymandias and that is the stuff I like so here's stuff I like is Ozymandias do you have the stuff I like emblem up there come on Ozymandias is Byron's that buyer Shelley's poem written after they discovered a head of ramses ii and ramses ii was one of the greatest of the egyptian pharaohs and they found like a fragment of a statue of ramses ii that's what they found and shelley and a friend of his Horace Smith and had a poem a contest between themselves to write a poem about this in Horace Smith wrote a poem they both both of the poems had the same theme which is that grandeur passes away and people are proud of their grandeur but the grandeur passes away and it's Cara Smith wrote a poem which ended with the thought that one day people will come to London and they will see nothing but a fragment of a statue he wrote we wonder and some hunter may express wonder like ours went through the wilderness where London stood holding the wolf in chase he meets some fragment huge and stops - guess what powerful but unrecorded race once dwelt in that annihilated place that was Horace Smith's version of Ozymandias which was basically saying one day London will disappear one day America we would say now or disappear and that will just find this statue of Donald Trump and they'll say who was this Shelly on the other hand who was a great poet wrote one of the classics of English literature oh it's very short I will read you the whole thing I met a traveller from an antique land who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand in the desert near them on the sand half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown and wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command tell that it's sculptor well those passions read which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things the hand that mocked them and the heart that fed and on the pedestal these words appear my name is Ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair nothing beside remains round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away one of the really fascinating things about this poem is Shelley was a devout atheist who was a radical and an atheist and a terrible human being but Ramses the second is one of the main candidates for the Pharaoh who doused stood with Moses to let go of the Hebrews which gives the poem a completely unintended idea of the way some things pass away and some things don't because the Egyptians as we knew them are utterly gone the Jews as we knew them they just keep chugging on somehow somehow the clayvin last weekend is upon us I am Andrew Clavin this is the Andrew Clavin show the survivors will gather here on Monday take care in Florida and watch out for the storm we'll see them
