1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,939
so the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> debate that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:04,620
now the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone's discussing is</font>

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's and it's a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> debate it's a</font>

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,710
very intellectually stimulating debate

5
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's over the issue of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

6
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jesus is a socialist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person who runs</font>

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,520
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> democratic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> socialists of America</font>

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,619
made this claim recently in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> interview</font>

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then former comedian Stephen</font>

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,359
Colbert said the same thing on his show

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,880
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple days ago he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> God is a</font>

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,239
socialist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he cited as proof the fact</font>

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:36,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus didn't charge a copay before</font>

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:38,870
healing blind people<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,010
indicates that he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a socialist</font>

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,300
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright let's let's tackle this</font>

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">question was Jesus a socialist and</font>

18
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,690
here's my argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> no you nitwits no he</font>

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,640
was not a socialist

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,470
and if that's it that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the</font>

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,820
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll just leave it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want</font>

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,420
it's hardly<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hardly a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> statement that</font>

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,060
that warrants a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's so</font>

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,250
absurd but I realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a</font>

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,000
popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> among some Christians</font>

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,800
so I guess maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should elaborate a</font>

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,050
little bit more net<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if I had to</font>

29
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,560
elaborate

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,770
then this is what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I would</font>

31
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,740
say

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,320
I'll give you three reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> why Jesus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,020
not a socialist and<font color="#E5E5E5"> why this whole idea</font>

34
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">is completely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ridiculous and I'm gonna</font>

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,159
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty quickly through the first</font>

36
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:36,570
two reasons I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of self</font>

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,369
evident and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to focus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more on the</font>

38
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,470
third so first of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

39
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,619
endorse<font color="#CCCCCC"> any economic or political system</font>

40
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,929
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all so that's the first way we know</font>

41
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:50,130
he wasn't socialist because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he never</font>

42
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,119
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about about any kind of</font>

43
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,000
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> system or economic system</font>

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">which means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that he wasn't a socialist</font>

45
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:01,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">but he wasn't a capitalist either to say</font>

46
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,420
that Jesus<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a capitalist would also</font>

47
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,429
be ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you do on occasion</font>

48
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear that you don't hear that claim</font>

49
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,000
nearly as often<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you hear that Jesus</font>

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a socialist</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I have heard in</font>

51
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,580
response to that Jesus was a socialist

52
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">argument</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have sometimes heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,450
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well no he was really a capitalist</font>

54
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it wasn't that either Jesus it's</font>

55
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,519
it's very glaringly obvious when you

56
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:26,549
read scriptures that or the least the

57
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:28,230
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that appears is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus doesn't really</font>

58
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:32,220
care that much what's what's economic

59
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,440
system you're you're living under that's

60
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,810
not really his point

61
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get to his point here in a</font>

62
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,970
minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he wasn't concerned with that</font>

63
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">he wasn't concerned with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making these</font>

64
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,430
reforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> to political systems that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

65
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,720
what he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> what he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was worried about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

66
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,650
could have and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that most</font>

67
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,810
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in his time expected him to do</font>

68
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> either they expected</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

69
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">and be a political revolutionary and he</font>

70
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and now we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 years</font>

71
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,970
of Christianity<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have we have the</font>

72
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,920
scripture you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that we can go back</font>

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">and reference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see very clearly that</font>

74
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">he was not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a political revolutionary yet</font>

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,630
yet still somehow even people<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

76
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,140
as surprised and I guess disappointed as

77
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,840
people were back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus's time that he</font>

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,970
is not a political revolutionary<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

79
00:03:26,970 --> 00:00:00,000
not what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was about</font>
