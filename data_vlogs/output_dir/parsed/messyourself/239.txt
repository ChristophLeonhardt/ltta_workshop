so hello everyone how is everyone doing
in special celebrate today we are back
with more late shift now if you guys
have a watch my series on late shift go
watch it okay it's like a short
interactive movie with a bunch of
different choices and I tell you what a
bunch of bloody endings now I said I was
going to make a video show you guys all
the endings but there is seven of them
okay and you have to play the game seven
times just to see them I doing that shit
I'm just going to show you the main ones
okay so in my let's play I died Ming Lee
got stabbed or whatever her name was
okay we did find out what happened to
the china bowl okay yes so let's go back
to where I messed up last time okay so a
backup parts house now now what you want
to do is don't hit him or I hitting him
would make you shoot him or a by you
just want to intimidate him and this
leads to this don't shoot don't shoot it
isn't here it's still at Hainsworth we
get this you said you picked it up last
night I couldn't get it not with the
police stood still in the vault
they went to be delivered when why would
I tell you oh okay why just get by that
book Lee then we'll wait here together
with the choice it's no doubt your
weight I'm very alone don't keep me out
of this I'll give you a million pounds
if you keep my involvement from the
choice what you could take a hundred
thousand pounds right now right out of a
safe rest later a million pounds he's
gonna and you get foot Frede scot-free
me okay who Scott um yes your dick Emily
about spirited okay so he did take the
china bowl
oh no okay yeah okay but I don't get to
risk the money the choice will find out
whatever it takes I call here's where he
took the ball is being paid up okay now
what happened with the bowl he heated
the bowl in that remorse and Samuel Parr
I'm going to pick up the thing myself
okay no no no no no that's time alright
so this is a different ending thank you
we're not gonna die we're going to get
the bowl alright but when we're going to
say it wasn't tall even though it was
past all the bowls okay
great okay you draw nice change my
clothes
don't change your coat no get out of it
okay so past all the bolt all right we
know that right and he replaced it with
a fake one
he hired Ming Lee girl to steal it and
then they tried to kill her
so they he tried to blame on us all
right so this is an ending I'm going to
get a million pounds just by keeping my
mouth shut
yeah I think this is a bad ending all
right shut up dude I hate these stupid
random speeches he gives okay so we're
back at the Museum all right and here we
go the china bowl stupid Park
he's the china bowl okay it was him all
along all right now he put it in a
secret compartment so he was going to
have it delivered to his house right
this is what I'm gathering it's kind of
confusing guys okay here's this chest
and it has the hidden compartment where
he swapped the bowl he hired that worker
that we saw at the hospital right and
here is the real bowl
okay now let's give it to the Chinese we
just really wanna cross people a friend
no it's not
my knife
Arthur now yeah you are you're done
stupid idiot quietly someone get a
million pounds I just I just know though
that I'm not going to get a million
pounds I know something's gonna go wrong
but at least I got a hundred thousand in
my pocket right now what could go wrong
okay let's give the china bowl back to
these guys cool fancy hotels walk over
it's one of the me oh shit at least I'm
not gonna die that's a good thing
morning oh yeah I've been running around
all time just trying to get this ball
back okay okay all right hopefully they
won't kill me I don't think they won't
kill me I know that for a fact but I
think they might kill the Chinese girl
by the way in this let's play I said
don't stop the Chinese girl China's
golden gets them in this in this run
okay
into the right bowl so Weber is our
cannibal I dig it in
yeah did I get in going equal Dooley or
cutting yes it's a lie mole look guys
that's what I said I could speak Chinese
by the way just saying all right you're
going to go verify the bowl we've not
been disappointed by your cooperation
thank you you're going to let me fluid
in where's Mae Lee huh she okay is she
alive which way to go
are we free to go one question uh-oh
mailing claim she was ordered to steal a
copy of the ball by Samuel pop uh-oh who
in turn intended to retain in secret up
that the original all for himself
oh that's true to your knowledge oh this
crew ah no quick
I mean yet oh yes proof No
does I need proof we investigate a
matter with mr. Paul himself
I needed prove it as my deal with car
perhaps you shed some light on the
matter by least I've got a hundred grand
right why
in may leave now where is my link yeah
room 731 oh god I don't think I don't
think I saved up
I think hello Oh Joely well did he say
what do you say goodbye
she did not say goodbye he said piss off
your bloody white cracker man oh shit
okay I think in order to get a good
ending we need proof that Tom stole the
ball how the hell did we get through my
legacy and I think you're like in your
life if you're like me you're likely to
feel like they still live with your lies
what suggest waiting very like awkward
I'm Mellie
with or fuck fuck
they consummate copies Meili wake up
they call the police all my flaws that
endings horrible
not only did mailing die but I got
blamed for it I've got it I start
mailing
okay so that was arguably the second
worst ending apart from dying now the
question is how do we save mailing now
that's the ending that we need to find
out okay now if you've watched the first
few videos you guys are probably really
confused all right now here's where I
messed up in the hospital all right I
decided to go straight to parse house
now I wasn't meant to do this I was
apparently meant to go back to the
museum now if I went back to the museum
okay and sneaked on by there's a whole
new scene where I could have snuck stuck
in by going upstairs
I found a computer what I found that the
china bowl was going to be delivered to
par this morning if you find out it's in
a delivery truck you go in the delivery
truck you find the chest okay and then
you you look at the bowl now apparently
one of the endings is you keeping the
bowl for yourself so let's watch that
now okay there's the delivery truck that
the bowls in okay now we can go get the
bowl right now okay go go go don't wait
go go go go go go go okay cool
so now I'm going to go get the bowl and
I'm going to choose to I think may is
going to ring me up and I'm going to
ignore her cold calls okay here's the
chest okay and finally hit compartment
and trying to balls there all right now
it's gonna give me an option to give it
to the Chinese no wait
I don't know let's see there's a lot of
money I can just walk away with it
no leakers why do you think that that's
an option
I was mailing okay no pick it up okay
I've never met you before tonight me
no it's bad you can't get away with that
you think you can get away with that
with the Chinese are for you they know
who you are they're coming for you okay
I'm gonna leave so hey we're doing the
murder in the book of my banquet okay is
getting any option to go to the sake
seastoke bring it here call out or cut
and run cut and run um yeah should I go
now go home okay now there it is a bad
ending as well I just expect to go home
yeah I don't you know what glasper with
this one all right you just know it I'm
just going to go home to my shitty flat
you know what's an apple guys you don't
need me just to kill em eyes are going
to get murdered by the trolls but
they're going to be waiting there okay
and shoot me or I don't know the police
isn't going come get me so good but you
know you know I'm not going to get away
with that right right okay
they're like Chinese are here okay and
done what you do the phone how you're
going to find someone to buy it
do you not think this one through it's
just stupid ending okay who would choose
this ending okay yeah I'm going to sell
it and get 12 million yeah on this one
awfully slow it up probably like what's
that you're next
whoa
they kill mailing send me a text message
and the police are at my I'm a flat damn
okay so that was about anything as well
I decided to go home okay now let's go
back and see if what happened if we
picked up the phone for mailing or
whatever okay now we're gonna call we're
going to pick up from mate all right
except hello wait oh yeah
c'mon don't bring your hair to all
things until you can't do anyway and
he's proved to them that it'll pass like
funny stuff okay are you attending I
need to get part of metals oh well you
okay she's alive right now in order for
us to both be alive do I risk going to
Paula's house to get us booked out of
this yes that's what we do what do I
take it to the choice that's want me to
do we to go to pause a chase we need to
we need to prove that it was paused plan
so pause the one who got in trouble how
could I live with that
okay we're gonna save some kind of class
all right now as far as I know this
could either go two ways badly or
there's only one good ending okay so
let's do the bad ending first and let's
see what's different good part I got it
bring it in us knowing what you may want
to think the Chiefs like oh oh
I wouldn't okay I just caught up the
chose I might turn the chose to come
here oh okay I think you've got a plan I
think he's got a plan okay I think it's
got bad
all right now I'm going to try and mess
this up I think I know the options too
