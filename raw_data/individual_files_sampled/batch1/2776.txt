one of my favorite things that I bought in the last year on Amazon is this soundbot bluetooth speaker that you can use in the shower it's only 14.95 which I couldn't believe the battery is really impressive according to the description in Amazon you can play the soundbot Bluetooth speaker for six hours without needing a charge I've had it for eight months and I have yet to actually have to charge it up fully I listen to music I listen to podcast so let's take a listen through the sound quality which I think it's pretty good for a $15.00 piece of technology I think it sounds really good I think the sound quality is excellent you definitely hear it over the sound of your shower because you're connected by bluetooth to your phone if you receive a call you can pick it up and talk on the phone because of a little microphone that's hidden right here so you can have a phone call using the soundbot while you're in the shower is one of the best values in terms of technology that I think you can find on Amazon if you want to buy one of these sound BOTS click our link it won't cost you anything extra but it'll make us a little bit more money and it will support vi video
