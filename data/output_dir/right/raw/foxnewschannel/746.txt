1
00:00:01,495 --> 00:00:05,598
HEAT OF THE DEBATE, AND THAT

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:06,933
THERE WAS NOT A QUID PRO QUO.

3
00:00:06,934 --> 00:00:09,235
>> Bret: DAVID LEE MILLER,

4
00:00:09,236 --> 00:00:09,602
THANK YOU.

5
00:00:09,603 --> 00:00:11,170
SOME MAJOR RULINGS TO TELL YOU

6
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:12,538
ABOUT OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

7
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:14,941
LET'S GET TO MY COLLEAGUE, AND

8
00:00:14,942 --> 00:00:17,944
ANGER AT FOX NEWS AT NIGHT,

9
00:00:17,945 --> 00:00:18,378
SHANNON BREAM.

10
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:20,580
FIRST UP, WE HAVE THE COURT

11
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,948
ESSENTIALLY TAKING ON THE

12
00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:22,949
DISTRICTS IN TEXAS.

13
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,851
SO THE QUESTION IS, THE

14
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:30,790
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS IN PLAY

15
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,392
HERE AND ALSO SOME STATE HOUSE

16
00:00:32,393 --> 00:00:33,192
SEATS IN TEXAS.

17
00:00:33,193 --> 00:00:34,594
WHAT THEY DID FOR THE MOST PART,

18
00:00:34,595 --> 00:00:36,896
THIS WILL BE VIEWED AS A WIN FOR

19
00:00:36,897 --> 00:00:38,698
THE REPUBLICANS TODAY BASED ON

20
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:39,799
WHAT THE COURT DECIDED.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,201
IN A 5-4 RULING, THESE DISTRICTS

22
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,974
WILL NOW LEAVE MOST OF THEM

23
00:00:50,778 --> 00:00:52,278
HELD HAD A PROBLEM.

24
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:57,417
THIS 5-4 VOTE, THE CRITICS SAID

25
00:00:57,418 --> 00:00:59,452
THIS WAS JOAN MIKE DRAWN IN A

26
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:00,153
WAY THAT GAVE MINORITY VOTERS

27
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:01,287
LESS OF A CHOICE, VOICE.

28
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:03,256
THE COURT SAID IT WAS

29
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:07,293
SEND THAT BACK DOWN.

30
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,564
>> Bret: SO THEY ASKED HOW

31
00:01:11,565 --> 00:01:13,800
MIKE ALSO TOOK ON ACTION IN THE

32
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,104
WE HAVE REPORTED ON MANY TIMES

33
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:21,474
THAT DECLINED TO DO FLOWERS FOR

34
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:22,175
A SAME-SEX WEDDING?

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,743
>> Shannon: WE HAVE ALL BEEN

36
00:01:23,744 --> 00:01:25,278
WATCHING HER CASE, SHE HAD A

37
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:26,779
LONG TIME CLIENT SHE WAS VERY

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,181
CLOSE TO BUT WHEN HE ASKED HER

39
00:01:28,182 --> 00:01:30,416
TO DO FLOWERS FOR A SAME-SEX

40
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:31,484
WEDDING SHE DECLINED BASED ON

41
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:32,518
HER RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS AND

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:34,287
OFFERED TO HELP FIND SOMEONE

43
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:34,887
ELSE.

44
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:35,722
THE MAN POSTED ABOUT IT ON

45
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,256
SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT'S WHEN THE

46
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:38,291
WASHINGTON STATE

47
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:39,726
ATTORNEY GENERAL FOUND OUT ABOUT

48
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:40,293
IT.

49
00:01:40,294 --> 00:01:42,295
HE ENDED THE ACL IN VIEW, NOT

50
00:01:42,296 --> 00:01:43,963
THE COUPLE, ARE THE ONES THAT

51
00:01:43,964 --> 00:01:46,466
SUIT THE FLORIST.

52
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:48,267
SO THE SUPREME COURT SENT THE

53
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:49,635
FLORIST CASE BACK TO WASHINGTON

54
00:01:49,636 --> 00:01:50,870
STATE TO THE SUPREME COURT

55
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:51,738
SAYING, RECONSIDER THAT BASED ON

56
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:53,940
WHAT WE DID WITH THE BAKERY

57
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:54,273
CASE.

58
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:56,442
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THIS

59
00:01:56,443 --> 00:01:57,276
CASE AND WINDS UP BACK IN

60
00:01:57,277 --> 00:01:58,478
SUPREME COURT WITHIN A YEAR OR

61
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:04,517
>> Bret: BUT FOR THOSE FOLKS,

62
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:05,885
THEY SEE OPTIMISM.

63
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:07,220
>> Shannon: YES THEY DO.

64
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:09,689
>> Bret: SO WHAT ARE WE

65
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,256
WAITING FOR TOMORROW?

66
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:13,926
THESE REALLY BIG DECISIONS THEY

67
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,528
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SPECIFY.

68
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:21,734
PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEES WHO SAY

69
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:24,504
THEY DO NOT WANT TO SUPPORT THE

70
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:25,538
UNION'S POLITICAL MESSAGES AND

71
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,105
ACTIVITIES.

72
00:02:26,106 --> 00:00:00,000
SO AGAIN, WE WILL GET ANOTHER
