DONALD TRUMP, JR.
HAS
BASICALLY ADMITTED THAT HE DID
TAKE A MEETING WITH A LAWYER
CONNECTED TO THE RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT, AND HE DID IT FOR
THE PURPOSE OF TRYING TO GET
DIRT AND OPPOSITION RESEARCH ON
HILLARY CLINTON.
NOW, IS THAT
ILLEGAL?
SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT
JUST ILLEGAL, BUT POTENTIALLY
TREASONOUS.
FIRST WE GO TO ONE
OF THE MOST ESTEEMED LAW
PROFESSORS IN THE COUNTRY,
LAURENCE TRIBE.
HE SAYS --
>>BECAUSE ONE OF THE VERY POOR
DEFENSES DONALD TRUMP, JR.
PUT
FORWARD IS, IT TURNS OUT SHE
DIDN'T HAVE THE INFORMATION I
WAS LOOKING FOR.
NOW LEGAL
EXPERTS ARE TRYING TO CLARIFY TO
DONALD TRUMP, JR., BELATEDLY,
THAT YOU CAN HAVE A CONSPIRACY
TO GET THAT INFORMATION EVEN IF
YOU DIDN'T GET IT.
THAT IS STILL
A CRIME.
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU AND
SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE DECIDE YOU
WILL ROB A BANK, YOU MADE A
PLAN, AND TOOK ACTION TO RUB
THAT BANK, BUT YOU FOUND OUT THE
BANK WAS CLOSED THAT DAY AND
WENT BACK HOME, YOU'VE ACTUALLY
ALREADY COMMITTED A CRIME.
IN
THIS CASE HE IS LIKE, I WENT TO
GO GET STOLEN GOODS BUT SHE
DIDN'T HAVE THEM.
HOW UNLUCKY
OF ME.
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
RICHARD PAINTER, FORMER
ETHICS LAWYER FOR GEORGE W.
BUSH, SAYS --
>>RICHARD PAINTER ISN'T GOING
TO STOP THERE, HE'S COMING WITH
A 2x4.
HERE HE IS ON TV.
>>DONALD TRUMP, JR. AND JARED
KUSHNER WERE APPARENTLY BOTH
INVOLVED IN THIS, THIS WAS AN
EFFORT TO GET OPPOSITION
RESEARCH ON AN OPPONENT IN AN
AMERICAN POLITICAL CAMPAIGN FROM
THE RUSSIANS, WHO WERE KNOWN TO
BE ENGAGED IN SPYING INSIDE THE
UNITED STATES.
WE DON'T GET
OPPOSITION RESEARCH FROM SPIES,
WE DON'T COLLABORATE WITH
RUSSIAN SPIES, UNLESS WE WANT TO
BE ACCUSED OF TREASON.
I WORKED
FOR TWO AND HALF YEARS OF THE
CHIEF ETHICS LAWYER OF THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION, THEY NEVER WOULD
HAVE TOLERATED THIS AND IF THE
STORY WAS TRUE WE WOULD HAVE ONE
OF THEM IF NOT BOTH OF THEM IN
CUSTODY BY NOW, THIS IS
UNACCEPTABLE, IT BORDERS ON
TREASON IF IT ISN'T IT SELF
TREASON, DEPENDING ON WHETHER
THE NEW YORK TIMES STORY IS
TRUE.
>>THAT'S A FORMER BUSH OFFICIAL,
HE'S BEEN TOUGH ON THE TRUMP
ADMINISTRATION THROUGHOUT, BUT
THOSE ARE ABOUT AS TOUGH A
WORDS AS YOU CAN FIND.
BUT HE IS
NOT ALONE.
>>WE HAVE POTENTIAL FOR ACTUAL
TREASON.
WE'VE GOT DONALD TRUMP,
JR., THE MINI-ME TO THE
PRESIDENT, MEETING WITH RUSSIAN
OPERATIVE THINKING HE WILL GET
INFORMATION ON THE HILLARY
CLINTON CAMPAIGN.
WHERE DO YOU
THINK THAT WAS COMING FROM?
IF THIS WAS A RUSSIAN OPERATION,
IT WAS SOMETHING COMING
THROUGH SPYING.
SO THERE IS PLENTY
OF SMOKE HERE, AND I THINK WE
ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THE FIRE.
>>NOW, I WILL USE AN ANALOGY
THAT SOME WILL CONSIDER
INFLAMMATORY, BUT IT'S
AN ANALOGY, IT DOESN'T MEAN HE
DID THIS.
IF TRUMP, OR ANYONE,
HAD GONE TO ANOTHER ADVERSARY OF
OURS WHO THEY THOUGHT WAS SPYING
ON THEIR OPPONENTS AND GOTTEN
INFORMATION, IT WOULD BE
PROBLEMATIC.
IF I SAY THE
CANADIANS, YOU MIGHT SAY THEY
ARE OUR ALLIES SO IT'S NOT SO
BAD, THE ANSWER WOULD BE AS IT
IS.
IF I SAY THE CHINESE, YOU
SAY I GET IT, THE CHINESE MIGHT
WANT TO STEAL INFORMATION ABOUT
HILLARY CLINTON OR MAYBE TRUMP
DEPENDING ON WHO THEY ARE
SUPPORTING, THAT WOULD BE BAD TO
WORK WITH A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT
LIKE THAT.
WHAT IF I SAID
ANOTHER ADVERSARY, LIKE AL
QAEDA?
IMAGINE IF AL QAEDA HAD
INFORMATION THEY HAD STOLEN
SOMEHOW FROM ONE OF THE PEOPLE
RUNNING IN THE RACE, AND THEY
OFFERED IT TO THE OTHER, AND THE
OTHER CAMP WAS LIKE, SURE.
I'LL
TAKE A MEETING WITH THEM AND SEE
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION THEY
STOLE ON MY OPPONENTS, AND SEE
IF I CAN USE IT IN THE ELECTION.
PEOPLE WOULD BE PISSED.
I'M NOT
SAYING RUSSIA IS THE SAME AS AL
QAEDA, AND GIVING YOU A RANGE
FROM CANADA TO AL QAEDA TO GIVE
YOU A SENSE THAT THIS IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU DO.
YOU DON'T TRY
TO GET STOLEN INFORMATION
CERTAINLY FROM ADVERSARIES, OR
EVEN FROM ALLIES, FROM A FOREIGN
COUNTRY TO USE AGAINST YOUR
POLITICAL OPPONENTS.
YES, THAT
IS IN FACT ILLEGAL.
AND THERE'S
ONE LAST INTERESTING THEORY,
IT'S FROM A FORMER CIA
OPERATIVE, AND SHE IS BASICALLY
SAYING, YOU KNOW, THEY MIGHT
HAVE DONE THIS, THE KREMLIN
MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS, JUST TO
GET THESE IDIOTS TO SHOW UP, AND
IF THEY DO THEN THEY HAVE
SOMETHING ON THEM.
EVEN IF THERE
IS NO INFORMATION TO GIVE THEM,
THE RUSSIANS KNOW THAT YOU
SHOWING UP TO THIS MEETING IS IN
AND OF ITSELF ILLEGAL, THEN THEY
HAVE THE GOODS ON YOU.
IF THEY
WANTED TO USE THAT AGAINST YOU
MAYBE THEY COULD.
LET ME HAVE
HER EXPLAIN, SHE SAYS --
>>THEN SHE WENT ON TO TALK
ABOUT JARED KUSHNER'S ROLE, HE
DID NOT DISCLOSE THIS MEETING,
HE WAS IN THE MEETING ALONG WITH
DONALD TRUMP, JR.
AND PAUL MANAFORT.
SINCE HE DIDN'T PUT IT IN HIS
BACKGROUND CHECK, SHE
EXPLAINS AS SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE
THIS BEFORE --
>>UH OH.
SO, NOW DONALD TRUMP,
JR.
HAS LAWYERED UP AND ISN'T
ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
ANYMORE.
HIS EFFORT TO GET AN
ATTORNEY APPARENTLY WAS A DAY
TOO LATE BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY
ADMITTED HE WAS IN FACT LOOKING
FOR OPPOSITION RESEARCH, HE DID
GO TO THAT MEETING, HE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT IT WAS ABOUT, AND HIS
EXCUSE OF, I DIDN'T WIND UP
GETTING THE STOLEN GOODS, IS NOT
A GOOD LEGAL EXCUSE.
WHAT IS
THAT I HEAR?
LOCK HIM UP!
LOCK
HIM UP!
