I am Emily
some cheeky
up sex is also the fridge so it's a
packed day whoa great right now I'm just
passing the house of me something on the
air in London it just feels very
familiar it's like a kind of air that I
understand which i think the air in
Indianapolis it's not like it is not
sufficiently polluted or something like
that so it's pretty great too it
feel that says schoolyard that comes
with being like and also the concert I
feel like looking rather believe I know
look a bit silly as well something by
doing that in Indiana your move is where
anyway because you can adestria and
that's unusual and policy you have to
look at the pool all the time because it
brings us with no papers whereas here I
feel really really comfortable and it is
everyone here that's um connect so today
we're going to cheeky which is it just
keeps growing very gray to keep adding
to it so when I do I take advantage of
any opportunities like make the most of
it and make it an experience but it's
definitely also one of those things but
I just wanted you because I'm home it's
a place that's familiar

I was being really frustrated yesterday
which may have noticed if you follow me
on Twitter quite a bit sarcastic as I
tend to do and but basically there was a
situation where
this conversation about whether or not
bring Star Wars boilers is very soon at
the conversation firstly I really didn't
like the term rarity I think it's
outdated and it's also been it's changed
as you switch like words and phrases
often changing their use my concern is
that the discussion does not seem to be
so much about whether or not someone is
a developed character whether or not
that character is has been written well
enough and whether or not flawless
characters in that kind of genre
our good thing to learn our battle and
so on up get the bad things everyone
instead the discussion sees me whether
or not ray character Ray has a right to
the force and her kind of interaction
will default but also say that simple
times trophic terms like with do
functionally waived it needs to be
dismissed any time we simplify something
down to a true then we talk about them
in a way that think of me dismissed or
they are worthy of dismissal sorry I'm
just ripping them you run over right now
and all that they're worthy of dismissal
in some way that we wouldn't have we not
some quick term to just listen and
that's why sometimes I seek for ways in
which we talk about is prejudiced and
people and arbiters of prejudice we have
to be very careful that we don't package
it in a way that is easily dismissed
because we should actually look at these
problems with more focus and more
complexity the founder patriotic
stormtrooper bit creepy
anyone cooling
