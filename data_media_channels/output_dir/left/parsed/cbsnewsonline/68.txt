SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT. 
I MEAN, IT MAY SOUND LIKE OH 
THEY'RE BEING EVASIVE BUT I 
HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS 
WHEN THE GUYS AND MEN AND WOMEN 
GET ON THE SUPREME COURT. 
EVERYONE THOUGHT THAT JUSTICE 
ANTHONY KENNEDY WAS GOING TO BE 
A KEY VOTE TO OVERTURN ROW VERY 
SIS WIDE AND WHEN HE GET ON THE 
SUPREME COURT HE ACTUALLY GOT A 
CASE WHERE THIS WAS BEFORE 
THEM. 
HE LOOKED AT THE DOCUMENTS AND 
INITIALLY THOUGHT TESTIFIES 
GOING TO VOTE TO OVERTURN IT 
AND HE CHANGED HIS MIND AND HE 
WAS A KEY VOTE TO UPHOLD ROE. 
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID 
FOR WHEN YOU ARE ACTUALLY 
LOOKING AT THE CASE AND HAVE TO 
DECIDE IT. 
YOU MAY NOT KNOW HOW YOU ARE 
GOING TO RULE. 
>> JAN WHAT IS SORT OF 
DIFFERENT ABOUT KAVANAUGH 
THOUGH IS HE'S WORKED IN AT 
LEAST ONE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT? 
HE WORKED IN THE BUSH 
ADMINISTRATION. 
THE OTHER ISSUE OF CONCERN FOR 
THOSE WHO ARE NOT SO SUPPORTIVE 
OF HIM AS A NOMINEE IS HIS 
FEELINGS ABOUT PRESIDENTS AND 
WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL BE 
CRIMINALLY INDICTED OR SUED 
WHILE IN OFFICE CIVILLY. 
AND THAT WAS BASED ON AN ARM 
THAT HE WROTE. 
BUT ARTICLE THAT HE WROTE. 
BUT I KNOW THAT USUALLY THE 
HEARINGS COUNTY OF FOLLOW A 
FORMAT BUT COULD THINGS BE A 
LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE IN 
THIS CASTOCK GNAW ACTUALLY 
WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE -- 
KAVANAUGH ACTUALLY WORKED IN 
THE WHITE HOUSE? 
>> Reporter: I DON'T THINK SO, 
AGAIN YOU HAVE TO REMEMBERS 
THAT A LOT OF GOES AROUND COMES 
AROUND. 
THAT'S WHY REPUBLICANS AREN'T 
GOING TO BUDGEN DOCUMENTS 
BECAUSE THEY GIVEN OVER A LOATH 
-- THEY'VE GIVEN OVER A LOT OF 
DOCUMENTS, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO 
BE SAYING YOU WORKED IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE. 
I NEED THOSE DOCUMENTS. 
KAGAN WORKED IN THE OBAMA 
ADMINISTRATION AND DEMOCRATS 
DIDN'T TURN OVER ALL THE 
DOCUMENTS. 
IT'S COVERING THE COMMITTEE AND 
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE LONG VIEW. 
MEMORIES ARE LONG ON THIS 
COMMITTEE. 
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN HERE SOME 
SOFT THEM FOR 15 NOMINATIONS 
MAY SOUND LIKE THIS HAS NEVER 
HAPPENED BEFORE BUT THEY CAN 
POINT TO A NOMINATION FROM LIKE 
1992 AND SAY OH, YEAH IT DID 
AND YOU GUYS DID ID AGAIN. 
WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND. 
>> THAT'S A GREAT POINT JAN. 
AND YOUR POINT ABOUT JUSTY 
KENNEDY IS WELL TAKEN BECAUSE A 
LOT OF PEOPLE FEINT THAT. 
THEY FETE THE REASONS WHY HE 
WAS PERHAPS PUT UP FOR THE 
BENCH. 
THE HEARING IS JUST ABOUT TO 
GET STARTED. 
JAN CRAWFORD, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
AS ALWAYS. 
WE'LL BE TALKING TO YOU 
THROUGHOUT DAY WHEN OUR BREAKS 
HOPEFULLY AND THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH. 
>> OH, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. 
THANK YOU GUYS. 
>>> SO THIS IS WE SEE A CERTAIN 
CAREMAN GRASSLEY JUST GAVELING 
IN. 
THE PROCEEDINGS AND THERE WE 
SEE JUDGE KAVANAUGH SEATED AND 
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN HEAR WHAT'S 
GOING ON. 
>> GOOD MORNING EVERY. 
ESPECIALLY JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND 
HIS WIFE ASHLEY. 
YESTERDAY EACH SENATOR MADE 
THEIR OPENING REMARKS. 
WE ALSOHEARD FROM THREE PEOPLE 
WHO HAD THE HONOR OF 
INTRODUCING JUDGE KAVANAUGH, 
SECRETARY RICE, SENATOR PORTMAN 
AND ATTORNEY LISA B LATTE AND 
WE HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME 
DIRECTLY FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
HE MADE A POWERFUL AND 
COMPELLING AND CONVINCING 
STATEMENT. 
DEMONSTRATING HIS EXCEPTIONAL 
BACKGROUND AND QUALIFICATIONS 
TO SERVE ARENATION'S HIGHEST 
COURT. 
-- OUR NATION'S HIGHEST COURT. 
NBC REPORTED THAT DEMOCRAT 
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE 
PLOTTED WITH A MINORITY LEADER 
TO DISRUPT THE HEARING TODAY. 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS INTERRUPTED 
63 TIMES IN THE LUNCH AND IN 
THE AUDIENCE -- BEFORE LUNCH 
AND IN THE AUDIENCE SEVEN 
PEOPLE WERE ARRESTED YESTERDAY. 
ALL PROBABLY VERY 
CONSTITUTIONALLY PREPARED TO DO 
THAT. 
DOING WHAT THE CONSTITUTION 
SAYS THE RIGHT OF FREEDOM OF 
SPEECH. 
BUT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO FINDLY 
CONDUCT -- FINALLY CONDUCT OUR 
HEARING THE WAY IT SHOULD BE 
CONDUCTED. 
YESTERDAY WAS JUST OPENING 
STATEMENTS. 
IT WAS ONLY -- IT WAS ONLY OUR 
TIME AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT 
WE WASTED ON DISRUPTION AND 
DISORDER OVER A PROCEDURAL 
MATTER. 
BUT TODAY IS DIFFERENT.
>> SHAM PRESIDENT, SHAM 
JUSTICE, NO MORE. 
STOP --  
>> SENATOR GRASSLEY, I TAKE 
OFFENSE, I CALLED OUT SENATOR 
DURBIN. 
I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN SAY 
THAT I WAS WORKING WITH SENATOR 
DURBIN. 
ISLAND PROUD TO SAY -- I CALLED 
HIM OUT SPECIFICALLY. 
WE ARE NOT WORKING WITH THE 
DEMOCRATS. 
WE ARE WORKING FOR OURSELVES -- 
 
>> IT'S OUT OF TIME -- OUR TIME 
AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS YESTERDAY 
TO MAKE OUR CASE, TODAY IS 
DIFFERENCE. 
TODAY IS THE DAY THAT THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SUPPOSED TO 
HEAR FROM THE NOMINEE. 
THIS MORNING, WE'LL BEGIN OUR 
QUESTIONING OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH. 
WE WILL GET THROUGH ALL MEMBERS 
FIRST ROUNDS OF QUESTIONS 
TODAY. 
NO MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES. 
MEMBERS ARE ALLOTTED 30 MINUTES 
FOR THE FIRST ROUND. 
IF YOUR TIME EXPIRES YOUR 
REMAINING QUESTIONS MAY BE 
CONTINUED OF COURSE IN THE 
SECOND ROUND TOMORROW. 
WE'LL TAKE A LUNCH BREAK AS 
WELL AS PROBABLY TWO OTHER 15 
MINUTE BREAKS THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY FOR NOW, LET'S PLAN OUR 
FIRST BREAK AFTER FIVE SENATORS 
OR SO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR 
QUESTIONS. 
I ASSUME THIS WILL BE AROUND 
12:15 WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY 
COINCIDE WITH A FLOOR VOTE 
ALREADY SCHEDULED. 
THIS WOULD BE A THREE MINUTE -- 
30 MINUTE BREAK. 
FOR VOTE AND LUNCH. 
BUT JUDGE, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
TAKE A BREAK ANY OTHER TIME, 
LET US KNOW. 
WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE 
THAT. 
AND WITH THAT, I WILL START THE 
QUESTIONING OF MY 30 MINUTES. 
JUDGE, FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS, 
YOU HAVE SERVED AS A FEDERAL 
CIRCUIT JUDGE ON ONE OF THE 
MOST INFLUENTIAL CIRCUITS IN 
AMERICA. 
YOU HAVE OFFERED 307 JUDICIAL 
OPINIONS AND DRAWN HUNDREDS 
MORE. 
TOTALLING MORE THAN 10,000 
PAGES OF RECORDS AND YOU HAVE 
DECIDED SOME OF THE MOST 
PRESSING LEGAL ISSUES FACING 
OUR COUNTRY. 
THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED 
STATES, THE ONE YOU ARE 
NOMINATED TO BE ON, HAS ADOPTED 
A LEGAL POSITION, YOUR LEGAL 
POSITION FROM AT LEAST 12 
OPINIONS. 
THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
HAS RECEIVED DOZENS OF STRONG 
LETTERS OF SUPPORT FROM 
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. 
MANY OF WHOM YOU KNOW BEST. 
FROM ALL OF COY THE POLITICAL 
AND -- ACROSS THE POLITICAL AND 
IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM AND THE 
AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION HAS 
GIVEN YOU ITS HIGHEST RATING 
UNANIMOUSLY WELL-QUALIFIED. 
WE HAVE SAID THIS THIS IS THE 
GOLD START OF JUDICIAL 
NOMINATION. 
THERE IS NO DISPUTE THAT YOU 
ARE ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED 
SUPREME COURT NOMINEES. 
SOME PEOPLE SAY THE MOST 
QUALIFIED AND I DON'T DISAGREE 
WITH THEIR JUDGMENT AND THAT 
COULD BE FOR ANYBODY COMING 
BEFORE THE UNITED STATES 
SENATE. 
NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO SAYS THAT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A WILL THER 
FROM LODGE -- LETTER FROM ROGER 
BAN IT. 
SURPRISINGLY PRESIDENT 
CLINTON'S ATTORNEY AND YOUR 
POSING COUNSEL DURING THE -- 
OPPOSING TUNNEL DURING THE 
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OF 
PRESIDENT CLIPTON. 
HE WROTE A VERY STRONG LETTER 
QUOTE -- BRETT IS THE MOST 
QUALIFIED PERSON IN ANY 
REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT COULD 
POSSIBLY HAVE NOMINATEDDABLE OR 
THE SENATE TO FILE TO CONFIRM 
BRETT, IT WOULD NOT ONLY MEAN 
PASSING UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CONFIRM A GREAT JURIST BUT ALSO 
UNDERSTOOD MINE CIVILITY IN 
POLITICS TWICE OVER. 
FIRST IN PLAYING POLITICS WITH 
SUCH AN OBVIOUSLY CONGRESSWOMAN 
QUALIFIED NEW MEXICO KNEE -- 
OBVIOUSLY QUALIFIED NOMINEE AND 
AGAIN A GUN AND A STRONG 
ADVOCATE OF DECENCY AND 
CIVILITY ON THE NATION'S 
HIGHEST COURT. 
MR. BENNETT ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY 
OF YOUR INTEGRITY. 
AND TO YOUR FAIRNESS AND OPEN-
MINDEDNESS. 
AND SO WITHOUT OBJECTION, I 
WOULD ENTER THAT LETTER IN THE 
RECORD. 
NOW TO A QUESTION. 
I IMAGINE THAT YOUR 12 YEARS OF 
JUDICIAL SERVICE ON THE SECOND 
HIGHEST COURT IN THE LAND HAS 
GIVEN YOU PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY 
TO THINK ABOUT MY FIRST 
QUESTION WHICH IS WHAT MAKES A 
JUDGE A GOOD ONE? 
AND WHAT INFLUENCES IN YOUR 
LIFE CAN SHAPED YOUR VISION OF 
HOW A JUDGE SHOULD GO ABOUT 
DOING HIS JOB? 
>> THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I YOU THIS THE FIRST QUALITY OF 
-- THINK THE FIRST QUALITY OF A 
JUDGE IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
SYSTEM IS INDEPENDENCE. 
INDEPENDENCE COMES DIRECTLY 
FROM ARTICLE 3 OF THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE FEDERAL 
JUDGES REALLY IS GUARANTEED BY 
THE FRAMERS IN OUR LIFE TENURE. 
AND OUR PROTECTION FROM PAY 
REDUCTION. 
SO BECAUSE WE HAVE LIFE TENURE, 
WE ARE INDENT AND IMMUNE FROM 
POLITICAL OR PUBLIC PRESSURE. 
I THINK THE FIST THAT MANGES A 
GOOD JUDGE IS INDEPENDENCE. 
NOT BEING SWAYED BY POLITICAL 
OR PUBLIC PRESSURE. 
THAT TAKES SOME BACKBONE AND 
JUDICIAL FORTITUDE. 
THE GREAT MOMENTS IN AMERICAN 
JUDICIAL HISTORY. 
THE JUDGES HAD BACKBONE AND 
INDEPENDENCE. 
I THINK ABOUT YOUNGSTOWN STEEL 
AND YOU THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE 
BROWN VERSUS BOARD OF 
EDUCATION. 
OR THE COURT CAME TOGETHER AND 
KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO FACE 
POLITICAL PRESSURE AND STILL 
ENFORCED THE PROMISE OF THE 
CONSTITUTION. 
YOU THINK ABOUT UNITE VERSUS 
NIXON. 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST 
AMERICANS IN -- ONE OF THE 
GREATEST MOMENTS IN AMERICAN 
JUICETIST HISTORY. 
WHERE -- JUSTICE HISTORY. 
WHERE HE BROUGHT THE COURT TOM 
IN A UNANIMOUS DECISION TO 
ORDER PRESIDENT NIXON IN 
RESPOND A CRIMINAL TIME 
SUBPOENA TO DISCLOSE 
INFORMATION. 
THE GREAT MOMENTS OF 
INDEPENDENCE ARE IMPORTANT. 
RESPECT FOR PRECEDENT IS 
ANOTHER ONE. 
WE ARE A SYSTEM OF 
CONSTITUTIONAL PRECEDENT. 
PRECEDENT IS NOT JUST A 
JUDICIAL POLICY. 
IT'S SOMETIMES SATED IT'S JUST 
A POLLTY. 
PRESTON COUPLES RIGHT FROM 
ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
ARTICLE 3 REFERS TO THE 
JUDICIAL POWER. 
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN AND WHAT 
DOES JUDICIAL POWER MEAN? 
JUDICIAL POWER YOU LOOK AT 
FEDERALIST 78. 
AND WHAT DESCRIBED THERE IS A 
SYSTEM OF PRECEDENT. 
PRECEDENT IS ROOTED RIGHT INTO 
THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF. 
AND THIS CONSTITUTIONALLY DATED 
TO PAY ATTENTION AND 
CONSTITUTION AND RULES OF 
PRECEDENT. 
BEYOND THAT, BEING A GOOD JUDGE 
MEANS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE 
WORDS THAT ARE WRITTEN. 
THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION. 
THE WORDS OF THE STATUTES THAT 
ARE PASSED BY CONGRESS. 
NOT DOING WHAT I WANT TO DO. 
NOT DEFERRING WHEN THE 
EXECUTIVE REWRITES THE LAWS 
PASSED BY CONGRESS. 
BUT REPUBLICAN FOR THE LAWS 
PASSED BY CONGRESS AND REPORT 
IF THE LAW, THE WORDS PUT INTO 
THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF. 
THAT'S PART OF BEING A GLAD JOB 
AND PART OF BEING -- GOOD JUDGE 
AND PART OF BEING A GOOD 
PRECEDENT. 
THERE ARE HUMAN QUALITIES IN 
TERMS OF THE INTERACTION. 
ALTHOUGH THE CONFIRMATION 
PROCESSES FOCUS ON ONE PERSON, 
AS IF YOU ARE MAKING BAWL THE 
DECISIONS -- ALL THE DECISIONS 
AS I SAID YESTERDAY I'M JOINING 
A TEAM OF NINE IF I AM 
FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE 
CONFIRMED. 
AND THAT MEANS SOMETHING. 
MEANS SOMETHING IN SPORTS AND 
IT MEANS SOMETHING IN JUDGING. 
I DON'T MAKE DECISIONS BY 
MYSELF, FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS I 
HAVE NOT BEEN MAKING DECISIONS 
BY MYSELF. 
EVERY CASE HAS BEEN IN A PANEL 
OF AT LEAST THREE JUDGES. 
AND YOU LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. 
WHEN YOU ARE DECIDING DAISES 
AND YOU WORK WITH EACH -- CASES 
AND YOU WORK WITH EACH OWN 
WHERE YOU ARE DECIDING CASES. 
>> SO HAVING COLLEGIALITY AND 
CIVILITY AS JUSTICE CAN ENDY 
SHOWED -- KENNEDY SHOWED US 
OVER THE YEARS, THAT'S VERY 
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE GREAT 
MOMENTS THAT I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING LIKE 
UNITED STATES VERSUS NIXON AND 
BOARD V. BOARD. 
UNANIMOUS DECISIONS AND THAT 
FORCED TOOK. 
THAT TOOK PERSONAL INFORMATION 
AND COLLEGIALITY. 
SO I THINK YOU KNOW I HAVE 
TRIED TO BE A VERY COLLEGIAL 
JUDGE. 
I'VE TRIED TO BE CIVIL. 
I WANT MR. CHAIRMAN, THE LOSING 
PARTY, THE LOSING PARTY, IN 
EVERY CASE TO COME OUT AND SAY 
KAVANAUGH GIVE ME A FAIR SHAKE, 
HE WAS APRIL WELL PREPARE -- 
WELL PREPARED. 
HE WROTE A CLEAR OPINION AND 
EXPLAINED EVERYTHING. 
I WANT THE LOSING PARTY AND I 
WANT BOTH PARTIES TO WALK OUT 
AT ARTICLE ARGUMENT AND SAID -- 
ORAL ARGUMENT AND SAID I HAVE A 
PROBLEM. 
EVERYTHING YOU DO A JUDGE 
HADDERS IN TERMS OF BEING A 
GOOD ARGUMENT. 
THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES I GUESS 
THE LAST THING I ALWAYS 
REMEMBER ABOUT IT IS THAT THE 
THING I SAID MY MOM TOLD ME 
FROM THE FIRST INSTANCE. 
JUDGING IS NOT JUST ABOUT 
THEORY. 
IT'S NOT THEORY, IT IS KNOT 
JUST WHAT A LAW REVIEW ARTICLE 
IS. 
JUNEING IS REAL PEOPLE IN THE 
REAL WORLD AND EVERY DECISION 
WE MAKE NO MATTER HOW MINDED IT 
MIGHT SOUND, AFFECTS REAL 
PEOPLE IN THE REAL WORLD WITH 
REAL INTERESTS AND WE HAVE TO 
REMEMBER THAT AND HOW WE 
EXPLAIN THE DECISIONS. 
THANK YOU MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> NOW FOLLOWING UP ON THE WISE 
WORDS OF SENATOR SASS 
YESTERDAY, ON SEPARATION OF 
POWERS, YOUR RECORD BEFORE THE 
SENATE INCLUDES MORE THAN 
10,000 PAGES OF A JUDICIAL 
WRITING. 
OVER DOZENS YEARS -- WE HAVE 
OVER 440,000 PAGES OF E-MAILS 
AND OTHER RECORDS FROM YOUR 
LEGAL SERVICE AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE AND JUDGE STARR AND WE -- 
YOU HAVE WRITTEN EXTENSIVELY ON 
THE ISSUE OF OUR CONSTITUTION 
SEPARATION OF POWER AMONG THE 
THREE BRANCHES. 
AND KEY COMPONENT OF THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS IS THE 
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY, 
OBVIOUSLY EVERYONE LEVS IN 
EIGHTH GRADE -- LEARNS IN 
EIGHTH GRADE CIVICS HOW THE 
JUDGES INTERPRETING LAW. 
AND LEAST DANGEROUS BRANCH. 
JULY'S SOLE JOB IS TO FIND AND 
APPLY THE LAW. 
EVENLY AND FAIRLY WITHOUT 
REGARD TO THE PRESIDENT WHO 
NOMINATED YOU. 
THE SENATOR WHO IS VOTED FOR 
IM. 
-- SENATORRED WHO VOTES ALMOST 
ID -- SENATORS WHO VOTED FOR 
HIM. 
SO JUDGE, LET'S DISCUSS 
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE FROM THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH. 
NO ONE, NOT EVEN THE PRESIDENT 
IS ABOVE THE LAW. 
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE 
CRITICIZED YOUR VIEWS OF 
PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY 
SUGGESTING WRONGLY IN MY 
OPINION THAT YOUR VIEWS OF 
PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY WOULD 
NOT ALLOW ANY MEANINGFUL ON THE 
CHECK PARTICULARLY THIS ONE. 
PLEASE TELL US WHAT JUDICIAL 
INDEPENDENCE MEANS TO YOU 
INCLUDING WILLING YOU HAVE ANY 
TROUBLE RULING AGAINST A 
PRESIDENT WHO APPOINTED YOU AND 
AGAINST THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH IN 
ANY CASE BEFORE YOU. 
YOU PARTIALLY TALKED ABOUT 
INCIDENT BUT SAY PLY IT 
SPECIFIC WILL YOU TO A RULING 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT OR THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH GENERALLY. 
>> THANK YOU. 
TO BEGIN WITH, YOU ARE CORRECT. 
NO BUN IS A ABOVE THE LAW IN 
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM. 
FEDERALIST 69, HAMILTON MAKES 
CLEAR ALL THE WAYS THAT THE 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH WAS DESIGNED 
BY THE FRAMERS OF THE 
CONSTITUTION WAS DIFFERENT FROM 
THE MONARCHY. 
>> SUBJECT TO THE COURT SYSTEM 
AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF 
FEDERALIST IMPORTANT PART OF 
THE CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE. 
IN GENERAL, SO TOO WE AS JUDGES 
ARE SEPARATE FROM THE CONGRESS. 
FLUSH WE ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE 
INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL 
PRESSURE FROM THE EXECUTIVE OR 
FROM THE CONGRESS. 
WE ARE INFEINT. 
WE MAKE -- INDEPENDENT. 
WE MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON LAW, 
NOT BASED ON POLICY, NOT BASED 
ON POLITICAL PRESSURE. 
NOT BASED ON THE IDENTITY OF 
THE PARTIES NO MATTER WHO YOU 
ARE IN OUR SYSTEM. 
NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM. 
NO MATTER HOW RICH YOU ARE AND 
HOW POOR YOU ARE NEW YORK CITY 
MATTER YOUR -- YOU ARE. 
NO MATTER YOUR GENDER OR SPACE 
IN LIVE AND NO YOUR POSITION IN 
GOVERNMENT. 
ALL EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW AND 
AGAIN LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES IN 
HISTORY. 
I ALWAYS WILL GO BACK TO GREAT 
MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY WHERE 
THESE PRINCIPALS WHICH SOUND 
ABSTRACT IF YOU ARE JUST 
DESCRIBING THEM WERE ACTUALLY 
IMPLEMENTED AND I GO BACK TO 
YOUNGSTOWN STEEL. 
AND YOU THINK ABOUT IT'S A 6-3 
DECISION RULES THAT PRESIDENT 
TRUMAN VIOLATED THE LAW BY 
SEIZING THE STEEL MILLS. 
THIS IS A TIME OF WAR, WHERE 
LOTS OF AMERICANS WERE KILLED. 
AND THE SUPREME COURT'S UNDER 
PRESSURE TO DEFER TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S WAR EFFORT. 
IN A 6-3 DECISION BUT WHAT'S 
INTERESTING TO ME, JUSTICE 
CLARK YOU DON'T YOU CANNILY 
TALK ABOUT CLARK IN IS THAT 
DECISION, WHY IS HE IMPORTANT? 
HE'S IMPORTANT, HE WAS 
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TRUE 
MONOTO THE SUPREME COURT. 
-- TRUMAN TO THE SUPREME COURT. 
WHAT A MOMENT OF JUDICIALEN 
INDEPENDENCE THERE TO RUN IN 
THAT CASE. 
YOU THINK ABOUT JUSTICE JACKSON 
WHO HAD BEEN WORKING FOR 
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT AND THEN 
DEDESCENDS IN THE CASE, STAND 
UP AND SAYS LETTING RACISM LIKE 
THIS IS LIKE LETTING A -- [ 
INAUDIBLE ] JUSTICE JACKSON -- 
>> AND HIM TO SUSPEND. 
>> Reporter: ASK HIM TO 
SUSPEND. 
>> JUSTICE JACKSON'S 
CONCURRENCE IN YOUNGSTOWN WHICH 
IS OF COURSE WHAT HAS BECOME 
THE LAW THAT THREE PART TEST 
CATEGORY 1, CATEGORY TWO, 
CATEGORY 3. BUT AGAIN HE WRITES 
THAT HE TAD TAKEN POSITIONS 
CONTRARY TO THAT ONE WHEN HE 
WORKED IN THE ROOSEVELT 
ADMINISTRATION. 
HOW ABOUT CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER? 
UNITED STATES VERSUS NIXON. 
WRITES THE OPINION. 
UNANIMOUS. 
MOMENTS OF JUDICIAL 
INDEPENDENCE. 
SO IT'S RESISTING PUBLIC 
PRESSURE POLITICAL PRESSURE AND 
IT'S TWEETING EVERYONE -- 
TREATING EVERYONE EQUALLY NO 
MATTER WHERE YOU ARE AND YOUR 
STATION. 
WHEN I WAS A -- BECAME A JUDGE 
ON THE IT CAN CIRCUIT, I HAD A 
-- DC CIRCUIT, I HAD A CALL. 
WHO'S HAMDAN?
 SO IN THE -- IN 
THE HAMDAN CASE, HAMDAN'S ONE 
OF BIN LADEN'S ASSOCIATES. 
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE A NOMINEE 
-- MR. CHAIRMAN, SHOULD I 
PROCEED? 
>> YES. 
THIS IS COMING OUT OF MY TIME. 
BUT THAT'S OKAY. 
LET THESE PEOPLE HAVE THEIR 
FREE SPEECH. 
AND INTERRUPT THE OTHER 300 
MILLION PEOPLE LISTENING -- 
THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO 
SPEAK TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. 
AND FOR THEM TO MAKE A JUDGE 
ABOUT ITN'T IF THEY WANT TO -- 
AFFECT WHAT THE OTHER 300 
MILLION PEOPLE HEAR FROM YOU, 
THEN THAT'S JUST TOO BAD. 
YOU PROCEED NOW. 
>> HAMDAN'S ONE OF BIN LADEN'S 
ASSOCIATES INVOLVED BEFORE 
SEPTEMBER 11th. 
WORST ATTACK EVER ON AMERICAN 
SOIL. 
HE'S PROSECUTED BEFORE MILITARY 
COMMISSION. 
SIGNATURE PROSECUTION OF THE 
BUSH ADMINISTRATION. 
COMES TO THE DC CIRCUIT. 
I'M ON THE PANEL. 
I WRITE THE OPINION SAYING THAT 
HIS MILITARY COMMISSION 
PROSECUTION IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
VIOLATES EX POST FACTO 
PRINCIPALS. 
FLUSH -- PRINCIPLES, YOU WILL 
NEVER HAVE A NOMINEE WHO'S 
RULED FOR A MORE UNPOPULAR 
DEFENDANT THAN RULING FOR 
HAMDAN. 
WHY DID I DO THAT IN THAT CASE? 
WHY DID I RULE FOR SOMEONE WHO 
HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE 
SEPTEMBER 11th? 
IT'S BECAUSE THE LOU COMPELLED 
IT -- LAW COMPELLED IT. 
WE DON'T MAKE DECISIONS BASED 
ON WHO PEOPLE ARE. 
OR THEIR POLICY PREFERENCES. 
OR THE MOMENT. 
WE BASE DECISIONS ON THE LAW. 
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY'S EXAMPLE 
OF INDEPENDENCE IS SHOTGUN I 
TRIED TO FOLLOWABLE -- 
SOMETHINGSY I TRIED TO -- 
SOMETHING I TRIED TO FOLLOW. 
NOT A PRO PLAINTIFF OR PRO 
DEFENSE JUDGE. 
NOT A PRO PROSECUTIONER OR PRO 
DEFENSE JUDGE. 
I'M A PRO LAW JUDGE AND YOU 
RULED FOR PARTIES -- I RULED 
FOR PARTIES BASED ON WHETHER 
THEY HAVE THE LAW ON THEIR 
SIDE. 
THAT'S PART OF BEING AN 
INDEPENDENT JUDGE IS RULING FOR 
THE PARY NO GNATTER WHO THEY 
ARE -- MATTER WHO THEY ARE AS 
LONG AS THE PARTY IS RIGHT. 
IF YOU WALK INTO MY COURTROOM 
AND YOU HAVE THE BETTER LEGAL 
ARGUMENTS, YOU WILL WIN. 
>> I THINK YOU ANSWERED MY NEXT 
QUESTION BASED UPON WHAT YOU 
SAID ABOUT HAMDAN. 
BUT THERE'S PROBABLY OVER 
EXAMPLE -- OTHER EXAMPLES YOU 
DON'T NEED TO GO INTO DETAIL. 
BUT YOU HAVE --  
 
>> PRESIDENT BUSH APPOINTED 
YOU, ARE THERE OTHER CASES THAT 
-- THERE'S BEEN OTHER CASES 
PRESUMABLY YOU HAVE RULED 
AGAINST ADMINISTRATION OF THE 
PERSON THAT APPOINTED YOU. 
>> ABSOLUTELY. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE WERE A SLEW 
OF CASES ON EVERYTHING FROM 
FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO 
SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW 
CASES. 
THE HAMDAN ONE COMES TO MIND 
MOST BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANCE 
OF THAT CASE YET I RULED THAT 
IT WAS UNLAWFUL. 
>> YEP. 
NOW DID ANYONE ASK YOU TO MAKE 
ANY PROMISES OR ASSURANCES AT 
ALL ABOUT THE WAY THAT YOU 
WOULD RULE IN CERTAIN CASES? 
>> NO. 
>> WERE YOU ASKED ABOUT YOUR 
VIEWS ON ROE V. WADE? 
>> NO. 
 ON A -- 
>> WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 
SEPARATION OF POWERS. 
HAVE YOU EVER WRITTEN ANY 
DECISIONS WHERE YOU USE THE  
10th AMENDMENT? 
I'M TALKING ABOUT DIVISION OF 
POWERS BETWEEN FEDERAL AND 
STATES? 
>> MR. CHAIRMAN, MOST OF THE 
CASES THAT COME TO THE DC 
CIRCUIT ARE AT THE NATIONAL 
LEVEL AND THEREFORE INVOLVING 
QUESTIONS OF SEPARATION OF 
POWERS BETWEEN THE LEGISLAIVE 
EXECUTIVE AND JUDICIAL 
BRANCHES. 
OF COURSE FEDERALISM IS A 
CRITICAL PART OF THE 
CONSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURE AS 
WELL. 
THE GENIUS OF OUR SYSTEM, 
FEDERALIST 39 IS DESCRIBED BY 
MADISON AS WE HAVE GOAT A 
NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND A -- 
BOTH A NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND 
A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
SIMULTANEOUSLY. 
THE HOUSE REPRESENTS THE 
NATURAL GAS PROPORTION. 
THIS BODY REPRESENTS IN MANY 
WAYS THE FEDERAL PART. 
EACH STATE REPRESENTED EQUALLY. 
AND THE FEDERALISM SYSTEM BY 
WHICH THE STATES ARE ALLOWED TO 
REGULATE LOCAL MATTERS IN SOME 
OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE CASES 
LIKE THE UNITED STATES VERSUS 
LOPEZ AND MORRISON. 
REINFORCE THE IDEA THAT THERE'S 
A CORE OF AUTHORITY THAT IS 
EXCLUSIVELY IN THE PROVINCE OF 
THE STATES AND BEYOND THE SCOPE 
OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. 
THE 10th AMENDMENT -- [ CROWD 
CHANTING ] 
>> THAT'S IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL 
SYSTEM. 
IT'S IMPORTANT ALWAYS TO 
REMEMBER THE ROLE OF THE STATES 
IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS 
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE 
AS INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS 
SOMETHING WE OFTEN FORGET. 
PARTICULARLY IN A PROCESS LIKE 
THIS. 
OUR RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES ARE 
PROTECTED -- LIBERTIES ARE 
PROTECTED BY THE FEDERAL 
CONSTITUTION AND BY THE FEDERAL 
COURTS BUT THEY'RE ALSO 
PROTECTED BY STATE 
CONSTITUTIONS AND STATE COURTS. 
SO GREAT JUDGE ON THE SIXTH 
COURT HAS WRITTEN A NEW BOOK 
ABOUT USING STATE CONSTITUTIONS 
TO HELP PROTECT YOUR INDIVIDUAL 
LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS TOO. 
THIS WHOLE DOCUMENT THROUGH THE 
SEPARATION OF POWERS AND THE 
FEDERALISM TILTS TOWARD 
LIBERTY. 
TILTS THE TOWARDS LIBERTY. 
-- TILTS TOWARDS LIBERTY. 
>> ALSO THE QUESTION OF 
INDEPENDENCE FROM 
, BECAUSE YOU'LL
PREDICT HOW CASES WILL BE RULED
BEFORE YOU.
MAYBE THEY WOULD VOTE TO CONFIRM
YOU.
IF NOT THAT I MIGHT NOT.
OF COURSE THAT'S IMPROPER.
JUDGES SHOULD NEVER PROMISE
THEIR FUTURE VOTES ON THE
EXCHANGE FOR A SENATOR'S VOTE
FOR THEM.
IF YOU ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR VIEWS ON SPECIFIC
SUPREME COURT CASES, OR PUBLIC
CONTROVERSIES OF THE DAY YOU'D
BE SHOWING THE OPPOSITE OF
INDEPENDENCE FROM THE
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH, POLITICIANS
CAN MAKE PROMISES ABOUT HOW
THEY'LL VOTE ON ISSUES, JUDGES
BY THE VERY NATURE OF THE JOB
SHOULD NEVER PROMISE ANY
OUTCOME.
IF A NOMINEE ANSWERS THESE
QUESTIONS IT THREATENS THE
UNDERMINE JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.
OF COURSE THERE MAY BE TIMES
WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE TO
RECONSIDER CERTAIN DECISIONS,
ESPECIALLY IF MORE RECENT
OPINIONS HAVE CALLED INTO
QUESTION THE RATIONALE OF
DECISIONS.
SO WITH THIS IN MIND I'D LIKE TO
EXPLORE THE APPROACH THAT YOU
TAKE TOWARDS SUPREME COURT
PRESIDENT.
COULD YOU TELL US YOUR VIEWS ON
THE VALUE OF PRECEDENT?
I THINK YOU'VE ALREADY DONE
THAT, BUT IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND
ON IT GO AHEAD.
HAVE YOU EVER FOLLOWED PRESIDENT
OF THE SUPREME COURT WHEN DOING
SO CONFLICTED WITH YOUR PERSONAL
BELIEFS?
>> MY PERSONAL BELIEFS ARE NOT
RELEVANT IN HOW I DECIDE CASES.
ROOTED IN ARTICLE 3 OF THE
CONSTITUTION, IT'S NOT JUST A
JUDICIAL POLICY.
THE ROLE OF PRECEDENCE TO ENSURE
STABILITY IN THE LAW, WHICH IS
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT --
>> -- AND ALSO TO ENSURE PREDICT
ABILITY, PEOPLE WHO ORDER THEIR
AFFAIRS AROUND JUDICIAL
DECISIONS NEED TO KNOW THE LAW
IS PREDICTABLE WHETHER YOU'RE AN
INDIVIDUAL OR BUSINESS OR
WORKER, YOU NEED TO HAVE
PREDICTABILITY.
PEOPLE RELY ON THE DECISIONS OF
THE COURTS SO RELIANCE INTERESTS
ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO
CONSIDER AS A MATTER OF
PRECEDENT.
THEY ARE ONE OF THE REASONS WE
HAVE THE SYSTEM OF PRECEDENCE SO
PEOPLE CAN RELY ON THE
DECISIONS.
PRECEDENT ALSO REINFORCES THE
IMPARTIAL AT AND INDEPENDENCE OF
THE JUDI GUESSARY.
THE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW IN THIS
COUNTRY THAT THE JUDGES ARE
INDEPENDENT AND WE'RE NOT MAKING
DECISIONS BASED ON POLICY VIEWS.
PART OF THAT IS TO UNDERSTAND
WE'RE FOLLOWING A SYSTEM OF
PRECEDENT, OF WHAT HAS BEEN DONE
BEFORE.
THE COURT, EVERY TIME SOMEONE
GETS ON, IT'S NOT JUST BOUNCING
AROUND TO WHAT DO I THINK'S
BEST.
IT'S WHAT'S THE PRECEDENT OF THE
SUPREME COURT, IS ALWAYS PART OF
THE ANALYSIS, AN IMPORTANT PART
AND FOR 12 YEARS, I'VE BEEN
APPLYING PRECEDENT OF THE
SUPREME COURT AND OF MY COURT.
EVERY DAY FOR 12 YEARS, I
HAVEN'T BEEN GETTING UP SAYING,
HOW CAN I REWRITE THE LAW.
I'VE BEEN GETTING UP FOR
12 YEARS EVERY DAY SAYING HOW I
CAN APPLY THIS FOURTH MEND MEANT
AMENDMENT
OR THIRD AMENDMENT TO THIS
PRECEDENT.
SO IT'S THE FOUNDATION OF OUR
SYSTEM, IT'S PART OF THE
STABILITY, IT'S ENSURING
PREDICTABILITY AND IT'S JUST
FOUNDATIONAL TO THE
CONSTITUTION, AS ARTICLE III IN
'78 MADE CLEAR.
>> NOW YOU'LL BE ASKED BY OTHER
MEMBERS WHAT SUPREME COURT
PRESIDENT YOU LIKE AND DON'T
LIKE, BUT AS YOU KNOW, IT'S
INAPPROPRIATE FOR A NOMINEE TO
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS AND THIS
REFERS TO JUDGE GINSBURG.
HE SAID QUOTE A JUDGE SWORN TO
DECIDE IMPARTIALALITY CAN OFFER
NO FORECAST, NO HENCE FOR THAT
WOULD SHOW NOT ONLY DISREGARD
FOR THE SPECIFICS OF A
PARTICULAR CASE, IT WOULD
DISPLAY DESTAIN FOR THE
UNDERLYING QUOTE.
GIVING HENCE UNDERMINES THE VERY
INDEPENDENCE WE DISCUSSED.
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
>> I DO, SENATOR, MR. CHAIRMAN,
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I
HAVE TO REMEMBER SITTING IN THIS
SEAT IS THAT THIS MOMENT IS A
MOMENT OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE
WITH HOW I INTERACT WITH THIS
COMMITTEE.
AND WHAT I'VE DONE IN EACH OF
THE JOBS I'VE THIS, PARTICULARLT
12 YEARS BUT ALSO IN THE
EXECUTIVE BRANCH, YOU ALWAYS
ASK -- I ALWAYS ASK MYSELF --
AND I TELL PEOPLE I WORKING WITH
ASK, HOW HAS IT BEEN DONE
BEFORE?
HOW HAS IT BEEN DONE BEFORE?
SO AS A JUDGE HOW HAS IT BEEN
DIFFER BEFORE IS PRECEDENT.
WHEN I'M SITTING HERE WHAT DID I
DO?
I STUDIED ALL THE NOMINEE
PRECEDENT.
I'VE STUDIED, READ THURGOOD
MARSHALL'S HEARING AND JUSTICE
BRENNAN'S HEARINGS AND THE
HEARINGS OF THE EIGHT JUSTICES
CURRENTLY SITTING ON THE SUPREME
COURT.
IT'S WHAT I CALL NOMINEE
PRECEDENT.
AND SO ALL THE NOMINEES
CURRENTLY SITTING ON THE SUPREME
COURT, ALL THE JUSTICES HAVE
MADE CLEAR A COUPLE THINGS,
FIRST OF ALL THEY CAN'T DISCUSS
CASES OR ISSUES THAT MAY COME
BEFORE THEM.
AS JUSTICE GINSBURG SAID NO
HINTS, NO FORECASTS, NO
PREVIEWS.
THAT ALSO MEANS WITH RESPECT TO
AT LEAST THE VAST BODY OF
SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT GOING
BACK, YOU CAN'T GIVE A THUMB'S
UP OR THUMB'S DOWN ON THE CASE.
THAT'S JUSTICE KEAGEN'S
FORMULATION.
I LIKED HER FORMULATION THERE,
NO THUMB'S UP, OR NO THUMB'S
DOWN.
THAT NOMINEE PRECEDENT IS PART
OF THE INDEPENDENT OF THE
JUDICIARY AND THAT NOMINEE
PRECEDENT IS SOMETHING I NEED TO
ADHERE TO WHEN I AM HERE AS A
NOMINEE NOW, BECAUSE THAT'S ONE
OF MY JOBS HERE IS NOT TO
ADVANCE MY OWN INTEREST, BUT
REMEMBER I'M A REPRESENTATIVE OF
THE JUDICIARY AS A WHOLE AND I
HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DO
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE RIGHT
HERE, RIGHT NOW, AS A NOMINEE.
SO FOLLOWING THAT NOMINEE
PRECEDENT'S GOING TO BE
CRITICAL.
NOW THERE IS AN EXCEPTION THAT
EIGHT JUSTICES HAVE DRAWN
CURRENTLY SITTING ON THE COURT,
IF YOU READ AT ALL HEARINGS FOR
SOME OLDER CASES, AND I'LL BE
HAPPY FOR SOME OLDER CASES WHERE
THE NOMINEE HAS ALLOWED THE
JUSTICES TO TALK ABOUT A FEW
OLDER CASES.
AND AGAIN WHY DO WE DO THIS?
WHY IS THIS NOMINEE PRECEDENT
THERE WHEN EIGHT JUSTICES OF
WIDELY RAGING VIEWS DO THIS?
THERE MUST BE A REASON.
THE REASON IS JUDICIAL
INDEPENDENCE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THE LITIGANTS WHO COME BEFORE US
HAVE TO KNOW WE HAVE AN OPEN
MIND, THAT WE DON'T HAVE A
CLOSED MIND, THAT WE HAVEN'T
COMMITTED SOMETHING IN THIS
PROCESS THAT IS GOING TO E FACT
HOW WE DECIDE A CASE BECAUSE WE
FEEL BOUND BY WHAT WE PROMISE TO
THIS COMMITTEE.
AND JUDGES FEEL BOUND LIE WHAT
THEY SAID TO THIS COMMITTEE SO
IF I SAID SOMETHING AND THE CASE
COMES BEFORE ME FIVE YEARS FROM
NOW, I'M GOING TO FEEL MORALLY
BOUND BY WHAT I SAID HERE AND IF
I'VE CROSSED THE LINE OF WHAT I
SHOULD SAY, THEN I'M IN THE
GOING TO HAVE AN OPEN MIND IN
THAT CASE.
THAT'S A VIOLATION OF JUDICIAL
INDEPENDENCE.
SECONDLY, AS CHIEF JUSTICE
ROBERTS DESCRIBED PARENS BETTER
THAN ANYONE, IF I GET INTO SOME
KIND OF PROCESS THAT APPEARS TO
BE A BARGAINING PROCESS WHERE I
SAY, I'LL AGREE WITH THIS
DECISION IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR
VOTE, IT'S NEVER THAT EXPLICIT,
BUT AS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS
DESCRIBED IT, THAT'S KIND OF
THE -- WHAT SEEMS TO BE GOING ON
SOMETIMES.
THAT'S A COMPLETE VIOLATION OF
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.
THE JUDGES AREN'T MAKING THEIR
DECISION ON THE LAW, IT'S AS
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS DESCRIBED
IT, IT'S THE SENATE OR JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE SENDING A NOMINEE TO
THE DELEGATE OF THE JUDICIARY
AND DOING WHAT THE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE SEEMS TO DO.
DOING THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION
OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE.
THAT NOMINEE PRECEDENT WEIGHS
HEAVILY ON ME AS A NOMINEE HERE
BECAUSE IT'S ROOTED IN JUDICIAL
INDEPENDENCE.
I HAVE TO ADHERE TO THE LINES
DRAWN BY THOSE OF PRIOR
NOMINEES, MR. CHAIRMAN.
>> WITH ONLY 25 SECONDS LEFT I'M
GOING TO RESERVE THAT TIME AND
GO TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN.
>> THAT YOU HAVE, MR. CHAIRMAN.
GOOD MORNING, JUDGE.
>> THANK YOU.
>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THE
CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT WE'LL GET
THROUGH IT.
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU THIS
MORNING ABOUT GUNS AND GO BACK
TO ROE V. WADE IF I MIGHT.
MY OFFICE WROTE THE ASSAULT
WEAPONS LEGISLATION IN 1993.
IT WAS LAW FROM '94 TO 2004, AND
ESSENTIALLY PROHIBITED THE
TRANSFER, SALE, AND MANUFACTURER
OF ASSAULT WEAPONS.
IT DID NOT, AT THE TIME, AFFECT
POSSESSION.
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THAT IT DID
WORK AND THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT
AND I HAVE WATCHED CASE, AFTER
CASE, AND I THINK I MENTIONED
EARLIER SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, WHICH
ARE JUST -- I NEVER THOUGHT THIS
WOULD HAPPEN IN OUR COUNTRY,
THAT SOMEONE WOULD BRING A SEMI
AUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPON INTO A
SCHOOL AND JUST MOW DOWN
CHILDREN AND STAFF.
AND SO I'VE BEEN VERY INTERESTED
IN YOUR THINKING ON ASSAULT
WEAPONS.
YOU SPECIFICALLY ARGUED THAT
D.C. ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN WAS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND I THINK
BECAUSE YOU SAID THESE WEAPONS
WERE IN COMMON USE.
WHAT DID I BASE YOUR CONCLUSION
THAT ASSAULT WEAPONS FOR COMMON
USE AND WHAT EVIDENCE OR STUDY
DID YOU USE DO THAT?
THANK YOU SENATOR FEINSTEIN FOR
THE QUESTION AND I UNDERSTAND OF
COURSE YOUR ROLE ON THAT ISSUE
AND YOUR LONG LEADERSHIP ON THAT
ISSUE AND APPRECIATE THAT.
I FACED A DECISION WHEREAS IN
EVERY OTHER DECISION JUST ABOUT
ON THE D.C. CIRCUIT I HAD TO
FOLLOW PRECEDENT.
PREEDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT.
I DON'T GET TO PICK AND CHOOSE
WHICH SUPREME COURT PRECEDENCE I
GET TO FOLLOW.
I FOLLOW THEM ALL.
AND SO IN THE SECOND AMENDMENT
IN CONTEXT, THE SUPREME COURT IN
THE HELLER DECISION WRITTEN BY
JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA HELD
THERE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL TO KEEP
AND RIGHT AND BEAR ARMS AND THEN
IN EXPLAINING WHAT THAT MEANT
AND WHAT EXCEPTIONS WOULD BE
ALLOWED TO THAT RIGHT, JUSTICE
ANTONIN SCALIA'S OPINION OF THE
REPORT IN PART THREE WENT
THROUGH THIS DOES NOT MEAN THERE
IS NO GUN REGULATION
PERMISSIBLE, SO THAT WAS AN
IMPORTANT PART, PART THREE OF
THE SUPREME COURT'S OPINION
WHERE IT PREIDENTIFIED A NUMBER
OF EXCEPTIONS THAT WOULD BE
ALLOWED.
FELON IN POSSESSION LAWS,
CONCEALED CARRY, LAWS POSSESSION
OF THE MENTALLY ILL.
POSSESSION OF GUNS IN SCHOOLS.
POSSESSION IN CERTAIN KINDS OF
BUILDINGS.
HE PREIDENTIFIED THAT.
AS TO THE WEAPONS, THE WAY I
UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE SAID THERE
AND WHAT WAS SAID IN THE
McDONALD CASE LATER WAS THAT
DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL WEAPONS
COULD BE PROHIBITED AND WHAT HE
REFERRED TO SPECIFICALLY IS
MACHINE GUNS COULD BE PROHIBITED
SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO
RECOGNIZE UNDER THE HELLER
DECISION MACHINE GUNS CAN BE
PROHIBITED.
>> THEY WERE IN THE FIREARMS ACT
A LONG TIME AGO.
>> YES, AND THAT'S --
>> AND HAVE BEEN PROHIBITED.
>> YES, SENATOR, AND JUSTICE
ANTONIN SCALIA'S OPINION
REAFFIRMED THAT MACHINE GUNS
COULD BE PROHIBITED.
THE SUPREME COURT UPHELD -- OR
STRUCK DOWN A D.C. BAN ON
HANDGUNS, MOST OF WHICH ARE SEMI
AUTOMATIC.
>> LET ME INTERRUPT YOU BECAUSE
I THINK WE'RE ON TOTALLY
DIFFERENT WAVE LENGTHS.
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR STATEMENT
ON COMMON USE, AS COMMON USE
BEING A JUSTIFICATION, AND
ASSAULT WEAPONS ARE NOT IN
COMMON USE.
>> IN JUSTICE ANTONIN SCALIA'S
OPINION USED THAT PHRASE AND THE
NEXT SENTENCE TALKED ABOUT
DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL WEAPONS
AND THE COURT IN HELLER ITSELF,
THE SUPREME COURT, STRUCK DOWN A
D.C. BAN ON HANDGUNS.
NOW MOST HANDGUNS SEMI
AUTOMATIC.
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING EVERY
APPRECIATES, MOST HANDGUNS ARE
SEMI AUTOMATIC.
AND THE QUESTION CAME BEFORE US
OF SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES AND THE
QUESTION WAS, CAN YOU
DISTINGUISH AS A MATTER OF
PRECEDENT -- THIS IS ALL ABOUT
PRECEDENT FOR ME.
I'M TRYING TO READ EXACTLY WHAT
THE SUPREME COURT SAID AND IF
YOU READ THE McDONALD CASE, AND
I CONCLUDED IT COULD NOT BE
DISTINGUISHED AS A MATTER OF LAW
FROM SEMI AUTOMATIC HANDGUNS AND
SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES ARE WIDELY
POSSESS WIDELY
POSSESSED IN THE UNITED STATES.
THERE ARE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
AND MILLIONS OF SEMI AUTOMATIC
RIFLES SO THAT SEEMED TO FIT
COMMON USE AND NOT BEING A
DANGEROUS AND UNUSUAL WEAPON.
THAT'S -- THAT WAS THE BASIS OF
MY DESCENT.
IN A NUTSHELL, I WAS TRYING TO
FOLLOW STRICTLY AND CAREFULLY,
THE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT.
>> YOU'RE SAYING NUMBERS
DETERMINE COMMON USE?
COMMON USE IS AN ACTIVITY.
IT'S NOT COMMON STORAGE OR
POSSESSION.
IT'S USE.
SO WHAT YOU SAID WAS THAT THESE
WEAPONS ARE COMMONLY USED.
THEY'RE NOT.
>> THEY'RE WIDELY POSSESSED IN
THE UNITED STATES, SENATOR, AND
THEY ARE -- THEY ARE USED AND
POSSESSED BUT THE QUESTION IS,
ARE THEY A DANGEROUS AND
UNUSUAL -- CERTAINLY ALL WEAPONS
ARE DANGEROUS.
ARE THEY UNUSUAL AND GIVEN HOW
PREVENT ALENT THEY ARE IN THE
UNITED
STATES, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
MAJORITY OF OPINION IN McDONALD,
I WANT TO REITERATE MACHINE GUNS
CAN BE BANNED.
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT THE HELLER
CASE, LET ME BE SPECIFIC, AND
YOU SPECIFICALLY ARGUED THAT IT
WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL TO DEFEND
ASSAULT WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY
ARE -- TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN COMMON USE.
AND THAT I BELIEVE WAS YOUR
DESCENT IN THE CASE.
>> YES, AND I WAS REFERRING TO
SOME SEMI -- SOME KINDS OF SEMI
AUTOMATIC RIFLES THAT ARE BANNED
BY D.C., OR IN WIDELY OWNED IN
THE UNITED STATES.
AND THAT SEEMED TO BE THE TEST
THAT SUPREME COURT HAD SET FORTH
IN THE HELLER AND McDONALD
CASES.
IF A TYPE OF FIREARM IS WIDELY
USED IN THE UNITED STATES.
IF I AGREE WITH THAT TEST WAS
NOT THE ISSUE.
I HAVE TO FOLLOW THE PRECEDENT
OF THE SUPREME COURT AS WRITTEN
AND THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO DO IN
THAT CASE.
IT'S A VERY LONG OPINION.
I ALSO MADE CLEAR SENATOR
FEINSTEIN AT THE END OF THE
OPINION, I AM A NATIVE OF THIS
AREA, A NATIVE OF AN
URBAN-SUBURBAN AREA IN A CITY
PLAGUED BY GUN, GANG, AND DRUG
VIOLENCE SO I FULLY UNDERSTAND
AS I EXPLAIN IN THE OPINION THE
IMPORTANCE OF THIS ISSUE AND I
SPECIFICALLY REFERENCED THAT
POLICE CHIEF KATHY LANEAR'S
ROLES OF REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE
WAS SOMETHING I CERTAINLY
APPLAUDED, BUT THAT I HAD TO
FOLLOW THE PRESENT SENT OF THE
SUPREME COURT AND AS I SAID READ
IT THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
I'M SORRY.
>> HOW DO YOU RECONCILE WITH
WHAT YOU JUST SAID WITH THE
HUNDREDS OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS
USING ASSAULT WEAPONS THAT HAVE
TAKEN PLACE IN RECENT HISTORY?
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT?
>> SENATOR, OF COURSE THE
VIOLENCE IN THE SCHOOLS IS
SOMETHING WE ALL DETEST AND WANT
TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND THERE
ARE LOTS OF EFFORTS I KNOW
UNDERWAY TO MAKE SCHOOLS SAFER.
I KNOW MY GIRL'S SCHOOL THEY DO
A LOT OF THINGS NOW THAT ARE
DIFFERENT THAN THEY DID A FEW
YEARS AGO IN EARLY ITS OF TRYING
TO HARDEN THE SCHOOL AND MAKE IT
SAFER FOR EVERYONE.
GUNS -- HANDGUNS AND SEMI
AUTOMATIC RIFLES ARE WEAPONS
USED FOR HUNTING AND
SELF-DEFENSE BUT AS YOU SAY,
SENATOR, YOU RIGHTLY SAY,
THEY'RE USED IN A LOT OF
VIOLENCE CRIME AND CAUSE A LOT
OF DEATHS.
HAND GUNS ARE USED IN LOTS OF
CRIMES THAT RESULT IN DEATH AND
SO ARE SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLES.
THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFICULT
AS I SAID IN THE LAST TWO PAGES
OF MY DESCENT IN HELLER, I
UNDERSTAND THE DRUG, GANG
VIOLENCE THAT HAS PLAGUED CITIES
INCLUDING WASHINGTON, D.C.
THIS WAS KNOWN AS THE MURDER
CAPITAL OF THE WORLD FOR A
WHILE, THIS CITY, AND THAT WAS A
LOT OF HANDGUN VIOLENCE AT THE
TIME, SO I -- I UNDERSTAND THE
ISSUE BUT AS A JUDGE, MY JOB, AS
I SAW IT, WAS TO FOLLOW THE
SECOND AMENDMENT OPINION OF THE
SUPREME COURT.
WHETHER I AGREED WITH IT OR
DISAGREED WITH IT.
AT THE END OF THE OPINION I
CITED JUSTICE KENNEDY'S TEXAS V.
JOHNSON QUOTE WHICH I READ AS
GUIDING LIGHT FOR THE LOWER
COURT JUDGES AND ALL JUDGES.
>> LET ME GIVE YOU A COUPLE
OTHER QUOTES BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
DO YOU AGREE WITH JUSTICE
O'CONNOR THAT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO
CONTROL HER REPRODUCTIVE LIFE
IMPACTS HER ABILITY TO, QUOTE
PARTICIPATE EQUALLY IN THE
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE
NATION, END QUOTE?
>> WELL, AS A GENERAL
PROPOSITION, I UNDERSTAND THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE PRECEDENT SET
FORTH IN ROE V. WADE.
SO ROE V. WADE, IN PLANNED
PARENTHOOD, A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT
TO OBTAIN A LEGAL ABORTION,
SUBJECT TO VIOLATION OF THE STAY
WHERE THAT REGULATION
CONSTITUTES AN UNDUE BURDEN ON
THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO OBTAIN AN
ABORTION AND ONE OF THE REASONS
FOR THAT HOLDING AS EXPLAINED BY
THE COURT, IN ROE AND ALSO IN
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY
MORE FULLY, IS ALONG THE LINES
OF WHAT YOU SAID, SENATOR
FEINSTEIN, ABOUT THE QUOTE FROM
JUSTICE O'CONNOR.
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE RATIONALES
UNDER GERD'S PLANNED PARENTHOOD
VERSUS CASEY.
>> LET ME GIVE YOU ANOTHER
RATIONALE.
IN THE 1950s AND '60s, THE TWO
DECADES BEFORE ROE, DEATHS FOR
ILLEGAL ABORTIONS IN THIS
COUNTRY RAN BETWEEN 2 00001.2
MILLION ACCORDING TO THE
GOODMACHER INSTITUTE.
SO A LOT OF WOMEN DIED IN THAT
PRESIDENT.
.
SO THE QUESTION COMES -- AND YOU
HAVE SAID TODAY -- NOT TODAY BUT
IT'S BEEN REPORTED THAT YOU HAVE
SAID ROE IS SETTLED LAW.
THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE OF YOU
IS WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "SETTLED
LAW "?
I TRIED TO ASK IF YOU BELIEVE IT
IS CORRECT LAW.
HAVE YOU BELIEVE IT HAS SETTLED
PRECEDENT AND COULD BE
OVERTURNED AND HAS YOUR VIEWS
CHANGED SINCE YOU WERE IN THE
BUSH WHITE HOUSE?
>> SENATOR, I SAID THAT IT'S
SETTLED AS A PRECEDENT OF THE
SUPREME COURT ENTITLED THE
RESPECT UNDER PRINCIPLES OF
DESIESIS AND ONE OF THE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND
ABOUT ROE V. WADE IS IT HAS BEEN
REAFFIRMED OVER THE PAST
45 YEARS AS YOU KNOW, AND MOST
PROMINENTLY, MOST IMPORTANTLY,
REAFFIRMED IN PLANNED PARENTHOOD
VERSUS CASEY IN 1992.
AND AS YOU WELL RECALL SENATOR,
I KNOW WHEN THAT CASE CAME UP,
THE SUPREME COURT DIDN'T JUST
REAFFIRM IT IN PASSING.
THE COURT SPECIFICALLY WENT
THROUGH ALL THE FACTORS OF STORY
TO DESIESIS AND WHETHER TO
OVERRULE IT AND JUSTICE KENNEDY,
O'CONNOR, AND JUSTICE SUITOR
WENT THROUGH THOSE FACTOR IN THE
CASE.
>> SINCE YOU MENTIONED STARRY
DESIESIS, AND WHEN THE PERSON
COMES UP, THE PERSON SAYS I WILL
FOLLOW STARRY DESIESIS, AND THEY
GET CONFIRMED AND THEN THEY
DON'T.
I THINK GOING INTO IT HOW YOU
MAKE A JUDGMENT IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO OUR VOTE AS WHETHER
TO SUPPORT YOU OR NOT BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE
DEATH TOLLS IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND I TRULY BELIEVE WOMEN SHOULD
BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR OWN
REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS WITHIN
OBVIOUSLY CONCERN FOR A VARIABLE
FETUS.
>> AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT
OF VIEW, SENATOR, AND HOW PEOPLE
FEEL AND I UNDERSTAND THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE.
I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE THAT
PEOPLE ATTACH TO THE ROE V. WADE
DECISION, TO THE PLANNED
PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY
DECISION.
I DON'T LIVE IN A BUBBLE.
I UNDERSTAND -- I LIVE IN THE
REAL WORLD.
I UNDER THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
ISSUE.
>> MY STAFF JUST PASSED ME A
NOTE -- LET ME READ IT TO YOU
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD --
HAVE YOUR VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER
ROE IS SETTLED PRECEDENT CHANGED
SINCE YOU WERE IN THE BUSH WHITE
HOUSE?
>> MY --
>> YES OR NO?
>> I'LL TELL WHAT YOU MY VIEW
IT'S I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT'S
REFERRING TO ABOUT BUSH WHITE
HOUSE BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT MY
VIEW IS, WHICH IS IMPORTANT
PRECEDENT IN THE SUPREME COURT
THAT'S BEEN REAFFIRMED MANY
TIMES BUT PLAN AUDIO AND THIS IS
THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE THAT I
THINK'S IMPORTANT.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY
REAFFIRMED ROWE AND DID SO BY
CONSIDERING THE STARE DECISIS
FACTORS.
SO CASEY NOW BECOMES A PRECEDENT
ON PRECEDENT.
IT'S NOT AS IF IT'S A RUN OF THE
MILLCASE OF THE
MILL CASE AND RECONSIDERED, BUT
CASEY RECONSIDER TODAY, A MIED
THE STARE DECISIS CASE AND
REAFFIRM TODAY.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THAT, AS YOU
MAY SAY THERE ARE OTHER CASES
LIKE THAT, MIRANDA.
SO MIRANDA'S REAFFIRMED A LOT,
BUT THEN IN THE DICKERSON CASE
IN 2000, CHIEF JUSTICE RENQUIST
WRITES THE OPINION CONSIDERING
THE STARE DECISIS FACTORS AND
REAFFIRMING MIRANDA, EVEN THOUGH
CHIEF JUSTICE WILL RENQUIST WAS
A CRITIC OF MIRANDA THROUGHOUT
HIS CAREER, HE DECIDE TODAY HAD
BEEN SETTLED TOO LONG, HAD BEEN
PRECEDENT TOO LONG AND HE
REAFFIRM TODAY.
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
>> I WANT TO SWITCH SUBJECTS AND
ONE LAST QUESTION.
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY YOUR POSITION
TODAY IS ON A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO
CHOOSE?
>> AS A JUDGE --
>> AS A JUDGE.
>> AS A JUDGE, IT IS OPINION
IMPORTANT PRESENT TENT OF THE
SUPREME -- PRECEDENT OF THE
SUPREME COURT AND BY IT I MEAN
ROE V. WADE, PLANNED PARENTHOOD
VERSUS CASEY.
IT'S ITSELF AN IMPORTANT FACTOR
TO REMEMBER, AND I UNDERSTAND
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUE,
THE JURIS PRUDENTIAL ISSUE AND I
UNDERSTAND AS BEST I CAN.
I ALWAYS TRY OF THE REAL-WORLD
EFFECTS OF THAT DECISION AS I
TRY TO DO OF ALL THE DECISIONS
OF MY COURT AND OF THE SUPREME
COURT.
>> I THANK YOU FOR THAT.
LET'S GO TO PRESIDENTIAL POWER
FOR A MOMENT.
YOU WERE PART OF KEN STARR'S
INDEPENDENT COUNCIL TEAM, WHICH
CONDUCTED A SWEEPING
INVESTIGATION INTO POSSIBLE
WRONGDOING BY PRESIDENT CLINTON
AND THE FIRST LADY.
AT THE TIME, YOU ARGUED FOR
AGGRESSIVE QUESTIONING OF THE
PRESIDENT.
YOU DID NOT TAKE THE POSITION
THAT PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS
IMMUNE FROM INVESTIGATION.
SINCE THEN, YOU HAVE TAKEN THE
OPPOSITE POSITION.
IN FACT, YOU HAVE SAID THAT --
AND I QUOTE, IF THE PRESIDENT
WERE THE SOLE SUBJECT OF A
CRUCIAL NAME INVESTIGATION, I
WOULD SAY NO ONE SHOULD BE
INVESTIGATING THAT AT ALL.
WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT AND
WHAT ARE THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE
A SITTING PRESIDENT COULD BE
SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL
INVESTIGATION?
>> AND I APPRECIATE THE SIGN
THERE.
SO THE LAST SIGN I SHOULD HAVE
MENTIONED WHILE I WAS UP, THE
SECOND AMENDMENT SIGN HAD
BRACKETS AROUND PART OF MY QUOTE
AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS THE
EXACT QUOTE BUT THIS ONE -- I
JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.
>> IS THIS ACCURATE?
>> AS A -- HERE'S WHAT I WAS
SAYING, SENATOR, LET ME EXPLAIN
IT.
THE LAST ONE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE
BEEN ACCURATE.
I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT FOR
FOR THE RECORD, IT HAD BRACKETS
FOR MY QUOTE.
SO WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE STARR
INVESTIGATION, THEN I WORKED
FIVE AND A HALF YEARS IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AND
I'LL GET SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR
QUESTION.
SO I WORK IN THE INDEPENDENT
COUNSEL INVESTIGATION, AND THAT
OBVIOUSLY A CONTROVERSIAL MOMENT
I WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED.
WE ALL WISH IT HADN'T HAPPENED I
REFLECT ON THAT, A WROTE A
GEORGETOWN ARTICLE REFLECTING
SOME OF MY THOUGHTS ON THAT AND
SEEMS TO BE A TENDENCY TO GO
THROUGH AND EXPERIENCE, WRITE AN
ARTICLE REFLECTING ON IT.
AND THEN I WORKED IN THE BUSH
WHITE HOUSE FOR FIVE AND A HALF
YEARS, AND I WRITE AN ARTICLE IN
THE MINNESOTA LAW REVIEW,
SENATOR KLOVECHAR, IN 2009.
WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S IN
OFFICE, I SHOULD POINT OUT.
AND I REFLECTED ON A NUMBER OF
THINGS I HAD LEARNED WORKING IN
THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S OFFICE
AND THE WHITE HOUSE.
ONE OF THEM WAS I PROPOSED
TIMELINES FOR CONSIDERATION OF
JUDICIAL NOMINEES.
I PROPOSED A HUNDRED DAY UP AND
DOWN VOTE.
IT WAS SOMETHING FROM MY
EXPERIENCE I THOUGHT WOULD AVOID
CONTROVERSY AND HAVE RULES OF
THE ROAD SET IF ADVANCE AND I
PROPOSED THAT SPECIFICALLY FOR
CONGRESS TO CONSIDER.
OTHER ASPECTS, I SAID --
>> WELL.
>> -- ANOTHER THING I PROPOSED
WAS FOR CONGRESS TO CONSIDER
WHETHER IT SHOULD LOOK AT
CLINTON V. JONES, OR THE CLINTON
OF CLINTON V. JONES INSTEAD OF
PRESIDENT, IT IS SUBJECT TO
CONTROVERSY WHILE IN OFFICE.
THE SUPREME COURT MADE CLEAR AT
THE END OF END OF THE DECISION,
CONGRESS COULD PROVIDE
DEFINITELY OF THE DISPUTES IF
CONGRESS SO WANTED.
SO IN THE MINIMUM LAW REVIEW
ARTICLE I PUT OUT SOME IDEAS
ABOUT WHETHER CONGRESS MAY WANT
TO THINK ABOUT THAT.
SENATOR DURBIN ASKED WHAT
CHANGED FROM THAT TIME.
WHAT CHANGED WAS SEPTEMBER 11th.
I THOUGHT VERY DEEPLY AFTER
SEPTEMBER 11th, ABOUT THE
PRESIDENCY AND VERY DEEPLY ABOUT
THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
EXPERIENCE AND VERY DEEPLY ABOUT
HOW THOSE THINGS INTERACTED AND
VERY DEEPLY ABOUT SEEING MR.
BUSH.
WHEN HE CAME IN, IN THE MORNING
OF SEPTEMBER 12th, PRESIDENT
BUSH SAID THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN
AGAIN AND HE WAS OF
SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS EVERY
MORNING FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS
FOR PRESIDENT BUSH, IT WAS STILL
SEPTEMBER 12th, 2001.
SINGLE-MINDED FOCUS AND THINKING
BACK TO THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL
EXRIENCE, AUGUST OF 1998 --
>> LET --
>> I PROPOSED SOME IDEAS FOR
CONGRESS TO CONSIDER.
THERE WERE IDEAS FOR CONGRESS TO
CONSIDER.
THEY WERE NOT MY CONSTITUTIONAL
VIEWS.
IF A CASE CAME UP WHERE SOMEONE
WAS -- SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SAY
THIS IS A CONSTITUTIONAL
PRINCIPAL, I WOUL HAVE A
COMPLETELY OPEN MIND ON THAT
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER TAKEN A
POSITION ON THE CONSTITUTION ON
THAT QUESTION.
I'VE ONLY PUT OUT PROPOSALS FOR
YOU-ALL TO STUDY TO THINK ABOUT
THE PLANS OF A PRESIDENT
FIGHTING A WAR, LEADING A WAR,
AND A PRESIDENT SUBJECT TO SAY
ORDINARY CIVIL LAWSUITS AS IN
THE CLINT OP VERSUS JONES CASE.
>> YOU'RE VERY GOOD.
YOU'RE LEARNING THE FILIBUSTER.
THE SUPREME COURT RULED A
PRESIDENT CAN BE REQUIRED TO
TURN OVER INFORMATION.
IT UPHELD THE SUBPOENA FOR THE
TAPES OF OVAL OFFICE
CONVERSATIONS THAT REVEALED
PRESIDENT NIXON'S EFFORTS TO
COVER UP THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN.
THIS AS YOU KNOW WAS U.S. V.
NIXON.
YOU HAVE SAID THAT THE NIXON
CASE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WRONGLY
DECIDED.
IS U.S. V. NIXON WRONGLY
DECIDED, IN YOUR VIEW?
>> SO THAT QUOTE IS NOT IN
CONTEXT AND IS A
MISUNDERSTANDING OF MY POSITION
THAT'S UP THERE.
I HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED U.S. V.
NIXON ONE OF THE FOUR GREATEST
MOMENTS IN SUPREME COURT
HISTORY.
SO I'VE CALLED THAT -- THE FOUR
I'VE ALWAYS IDENTIFIED ARE
MARBERRY VERSUS MADISON,
YOUNGSTOWN STEEL, AND UNITED
STATES VERSUS RICHARD NIXON, AND
WHY HAVE I -- BROWN VERSUS
BOARD, THE SINGLE GREATEST --
>> WAS IT RIGHTLY DECIDED?
>> I HAVE SAID YES, THE COURT'S
HOLDING A CRIMINAL TRIAL
SUBPOENA TO A PRESIDENT IN THE
CONTEXT OF THE -- OF THE SPECIAL
COUNSEL REGULATONS IN THAT
CASE, FOR INFORMATION, A
CRIMINAL TRIAL SUBPOENA FOR
INFORMATION UNDER THE SPECIFIC
REGULATIONS IN THAT CASE, I HAVE
SAID THAT HOLDING IS ONE OF THE
FOUR GREATEST MOMENTS IN SUPREME
COURT HISTORY.
SO NOT ONLY WHAT I WAS -- I CAN
CHAIN HOW THAT MISUNDERSTANDING
CAME UP BECAUSE THAT'S -- I KNOW
THERE WAS A NEWS STORY ABOUT
THAT AND THAT'S JUST NOT CORRECT
IMPRESSION OF MY VIEWS.
MY VIEWS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT.
WHY WAS IT ONE OF THE GREATEST
MOMENTS?
IT WAS ONE OF GREATEST MOMENTS
BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL
PRESSURES OF THE TIME.
THE COURT STOOD UP FOR JUDICIAL
INDEPENDENCE IN A MOMENT OF
NATIONAL CRISIS.
THAT'S WHEN THE SUPREME COURT --
WE NEED THE SUPREME COURT TO
DECIDE SOME OF THE THINGS WE CAN
SEE.
WE'LL HAVE CRISIS MOMENTS FOR
THE SUPREME COURT ON THINGS WE
CAN'T EVEN PREDICT AND WE NEED
PEOPLE ON THE SUPREME COURT WHO
ARE PREPARED FOR THAT AND U.S.
V. NIXON --
>> MY TIME IS GOING TO RUN OUT
VERY QUICKLY.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, CAN A
SITTING PRESIDENT BE REQUIRED TO
RESPOND TO A SUBPOENA?
>> SO THAT'S A HYPOTHETICAL
QUESTION ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE AN
ELABORATION OR A DIFFERENCE FROM
U.S. V. NIXON'S PRECISE HOLDING
AND I THINK GOING WITH THE
JUSTICE GINSBURG PRINCIPAL,
WHICH IS REALLY NOT THE JUSTICE
GINSBURG ALONE PRINCIPLE, IT'S
EVERYONE'S PRINCIPLE ON THE
SUPREME COURT AND AS A MATTER OF
CANONS OF JUDICIAL INDEPENDENT I
CAN'T GIVE YOU AN ANSWER ON THAT
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.
>> SO YOU CAN'T GIVE ME AN
ANSWER ON WHETHER A PRESIDENT
HAS TO RESPOND TO A SUBPOENA
FROM A COURT OF LAW?
>> IT'S MY -- MY UNDERSTANDING
IS THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO GIVE
MY VIEW ON A POTENTIAL
HYPOTHETICAL AND THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT THE -- EVERY --
EACH OF THE EIGHT JUSTICES, WHEN
THEY'RE SIT IN MY SEAT, DECLINED
TO DECIDE POTENTIAL HYPOTHETICAL
CASES.
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE U.S. V.
NIXON PRECEDENT AND I DID ABOUT
CHIEF BURGER'S ROLE IN A
UNANIMOUS OPINION.
CHIEF JUSTICE BERGER WHO WAS
APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT NIXON,
WRITES THE OPINION ORDERING
PRESIDENT NIXON TO DISCLOSE THE
TAPES IN RESPONSE TO A CRIMINAL
TRIAL SUBPOENA.
A MOMENT OF CRISIS ARGUMENT I
THINK JULY 8th, 1974, THEY
DECIDED TWO WEEKS LATER, REALLY
IMPORTANT OPINION, MOMENT OF
JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE,
PERSONALITY PRECEDENT OF THE
SUPREME COURT, BUT HOW THAT
WOULD APPLY TO OTHER
HYPOTHETICALS, I BEST, AS A
SITTING JUDGE FOLLOW THE PRESENT
TENT AND NOMINEES OF THOSE
BEFORE AND NOT GIVE YOU A
PRECISE ANSWER ON A HYPOTHETICAL
THAT COULD COME BEFORE ME.
>> UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU FOR
BEING FORTHCOMING.
I APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.
>> I ASSUME YOU WANT TO RESERVE
YOUR THREE MINUTES?
>> I CAN DO THAT?
>> YOU CAN.
>> I WOULD.
>> I'D LIKE TO ENTER INTO THE
RECORD THREE RECORDS AND AN
OP-ED SUPPORTING JUDGE
KAVANAUGH'S CONFIRMATION.
THE FIRST LETTER WHICH I
MENTIONED YESTERDAY IN MY
OPENING STATEMENT IS ALERTER
FROM 41 ATTORNEYS WHO ARE
MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT
BAR.
THE SIGNERS INCLUDE LISA BLANT,
DEAN MAYNERD WE AND DEAN
SULLIVAN.
THE SIGNERS HOLD A BROAD RANGE
OF POLITICAL POLICY AND JURIS
PRUDENTIAL VIEWS BUT SPEAK AS
ONE IN SUPPORTING JUDGE
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION UNQUOTE.
THE LETTER AUTHORS WRITE QUOTE
BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH
JUDGE KAVANAUGH AND HIS WORK
OVER 12 YEARS OF DISTINGUISHED
JUDICIAL SERVICE WE'RE CONFIDENT
HE POSSESSES THE CHARACTER,
TEMPERAMENT, AND INTELLECT
THAT'LL MAKE HIM AN ASSET TO THE
NATION'S HIGHEST COURT UNQUOTE.
THE SECOND LETTER IS FROM
CAROLYN WILLIAMS, A PARTNER AT
THE VENERABLE LAW FIRM.
SHE WRITES SHE'S FOLLOWED THE
HIS CAREER WHEN HE WAS A HIRING
PARTNER AT THE FIRM AND HE WAS A
LAW STUDENT.
MS. WILLIAMS SAID JUDGE
KAVANAUGH HAS ALL THE QUALITIES
LITIGANTS AND LAWYERS HOPE TO
FIND IF A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE,
SUPERB INTELLECT, LEGAL OKAY YOU
MEN -- ACUMEN, ABIDING RESPECT
FOR PRESENT SENT AND THE RULE OF
LAW, UNQUOTE.
I ALSO WANT TO ENTER INTO THE
RECORD A LETTER FROM AND OP-ED
BY JAY LEFKOWITZ ENTITLED BRENT
KAVANAUGH IS A MENSCH.
IN IT, HE WRITES, JUDGE
KAVANAUGH QUOTE HAS A STRONG
COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING
AMERICANS' FREEDOM OF RELIGION.
NO MATTER WHAT THEIR FAITH,
UNQUOTE.
AND MR. LEFKOWITZ SHOULD KNOW HE
AND JUDGE KAVANAUGH WORKED
TOGETHER IN PRIVATE PRACTICE ON
A PRO BONO CASE IN MARYLAND
REPRESENTING A JEWISH SYNAGOGUE
AND WON THE CASE OF THE RIGHT OF
CONGREGATION TO BUILD A PLACE OF
WORSHIP IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND LET ME JUST BEGIN WITH THIS.
I'D LIKE TO KEEP THE ANSWERS AS
CONCISE AS YOU CAN SO I CAN GET
THROUGH AS MANY OF THEM AS TIME
ALLOWS.
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE
SUGGESTED THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
NOMINATED YOU BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
YOU'D RULER IN HIS FAVOR, SHOULD
CERTAIN ISSUES COME BEFORE THE
COURT.
SUPPOSE YOU HAD A CASE INVOLVING
PRESIDENT TRUMP OR AN ISSUE NEAR
AND DEAR TO THE PRESIDENT, WHAT
ASSURANCES CAN YOU PROVIDE YOU
WILL NOT ALLOW THE PRESIDENT'S
PERSONAL VIEWS ON A CASE OR
PERSONAL INTERESTS TO IMPACT
YOUR DECISION?
>> SENATOR, I'M AN INDEPENDENT
JUDGE.
FOR 12 YEARS I'VE BEEN DECIDING
CASES BASED ON THE LAW AND
PRECEDENT.
IN EACH CASE IF CONFIRMED TO THE
SUPREME COURT THAT'S HOW I'LL DO
IT, AS WELL.
I'LL BE PART OF A TEAM OF NINE
AND DECIDE CASES BASED ON THE
CONSTITUTION OF THE LAW, THE
PRECEDENT OF THE SUPREME COURT
WORKING WITH THE OTHER EIGHT
JUSTICES WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR,
INDEPENDENTLY, WITHOUT PRESSURE
FROM ANY QUARTER, AND THE PERSON
WHO HAS THE BEST ARGUMENTS ON
THE LAW AND THE PRECEDENT IS THE
PERSON WHO WILL WIN IN -- WITH
ME.
>> THANK YOU.
IF AT THE END OF THE PROCESS, AT
THIS PROCESS YOU ARE CONFIRMED
TO THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH I
EXPECT YOU WILL BE, WHAT SORT OF
LOYALTY WILL YOU OWE TO THE
PRESIDENT?
HOW WILL THAT LOYALTY DIFFER
FROM THE LOYALTY YOU OWE TO SAY
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
>> SENATOR, IF CONFIRMED TO THE
SUPREME COURT AND AS A SITTING
JUDGE I OWE MY LOYALTY TO THE
CONSTITUTION.
THAT'S WHAT I OWE LOYALTY TO.
THE CONSTITUTION ESTABLISHES ME
AS AN INDEPENDENT JUDGE BOUND TO
FOLLOW THE LAW AS WRITTEN.
THE PRECEDENCE OF THE SUPREME
COURT AS ARTICULATED SUBJECT TO
THE RULES OF STARRE DECISIS.
>> YOU WERE APPOINTED BY THE
ADMINISTRATION OF GEORGE W BUSH.
I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU
WERE CLOSE TO PRESIDENT BUSH.
YOU WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
FOR HIM.
CAN YOU GIVE A SUM OF EXAMPLE OF
CASES IN WHICH YOU RULED AGAINST
THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION,
NOTWITHSTANDING PRESIDENT BUSH
WAS THE ONE WHO PUT YOU ON THE
BENCH.
>> SENATOR, THE MOST PROMINENT
EXAMPLE IS THE HAMDAN CASE, THE
MILITARY COMMISSIONS CASE, A
SGNATURE PROSECUTION OF THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
THEY HAD ESTABLISHED WITH
CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORIZATION
EVENTUALLY AFTER A UNILATERAL
EFFORT DIDN'T SUCCEED IN THE
COURTS, ESTABLISHED MILITARY
COMMISSIONS, THE MILITARY
COMMISSIONS WERE TO TRY
AL-QAEDA, TERRORISTS WHO HAD
COMMITTED WAR CRIMES AND ONE
CASE CAME US TO, SALIM HAMDAN,
AND THE QUESTION WAS, WAS THE
PROSECUTION UNLAWFUL BECAUSE THE
CRIME OF WHICH HE WAS CONVICTED
WAS NOT AN IDENTIFIED CRIME AS
OF 2001, WHEN HE WAS ALLEGED TO
HAVE COMMITTED IT.
E POST FACTOR PRINCIPLES, AND I
WROTE THE OPINION REVERSING HIS
CONVICTION HE WAS THOUGH IT WAS
A SIGNATURE PROSECUTION OF THE
UNITED STATES, EVEN THOUGH IT
WAS A NATIONAL SECURITY CASE
BECAUSE THAT'S THE RIGHT ANSWER
UNDER THE LAW AND DOESN'T MATTER
WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU COME
FROM, IF YOU'RE RIGHT UNDER THE
LAW, YOU PREVAIL.
>> I'D LIKE TO TURN TO YOUR WORK
IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION.
AS YOU KNOW, MY DEMOCRATIC
COLLEAGUES ARE DEMANDING TO SEE
EVERY PIECE OF PAPER OR EVERY
SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPER YOU EVER
TOUCHED DURING YOUR SIX YEARS
DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION
IN PART BECAUSE THEY WANT TO
KNOW WHAT ROLE, IF ANY, YOU
PLAYED IN DEVELOPING THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION'S INTERROGATION
POLICIES.
WELL, SIX YEARS AGO, RANKING
MEMBER FEINSTEIN WHO WAS THEN
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE AND A
GOOD ONE AT THAT, ISSUED A
LENGTHY REPORT ON THE CIA'S
INTENTION AND INTERROGATION
PROGRAM UNDER PRESIDENT BUSH.
THE REPORT DETAILED THE ORIGINS,
DEVELOPMENT, AND IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE PROGRAM.
IN 2014, A DECLASSIFIED VERSION
OF THAT REPORT WAS RELEASED TO
THE PUBLIC.
THE DECLASSIFIED VERSION OR
REPORT RUNS WELL OVER 500 PAGES.
AND YOUR NAME APPEARS NOWHERE IN
IT.
NOW, I MYSELF SPENT OVER
20 YEARS ON THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMITTEE.
I KNOW THE QUALITY OF ITS STAFF
AND THE WORK THAT THEY DO.
AND I KNOW THE RANKING MEMBER
AND HOW DILIGENT SHE IS.
IF YOU PLAYED A ROLE IN THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION INTERROGATION
POLICIES, I THINK THEY WOULD
HAVE DISCOVERED IT.
NUMEROUS PEOPLE ARE IN THE
REPORT BUT NOT YOU AND THAT
SHOULD TELL US SOMETHING.
WITH THAT SAID I WANT TO ASK YOU
FOR THE RECORD, WHAT ROLE IF ANY
DID YOU PLAY IN DEVELOPING OR
IMPLEMENTING THE DETENTION AND
INTERROGATION POLICIES?
>> THE POLICIES THAT ARE REFLECT
AND DESCRIBED IN SENATOR
FEINSTEIN EXTENSIVE, THOROUGH
REPORT WERE VERY CONTROVERSIAL,
SENATOR, THE ENHANCED
INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES AND THE
LEGAL MEMOS INVOLVED IN
JUSTIFYING SOME OF THOSE,
TECHNIQUES I N ALSO WERE VERY
CONTROVERSY IAL WHEN THEY WERE
DISCLOSED IN 2004 AND I WAS NOT
INVOLVED -- I WAS NOT READ INTO
THAT PROGRAM, NOT INVOLVED IN
CRAFTING THAT PROGRAM OR THE
LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THE
JUSTICE PROGRAM.
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID A
LENGTHY REPORT ABOUT LEGAL MEMOS
THAT WERE INVOLVED TO JUSTIFY
SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS.
MY NAME'S NOT IN THAT REPORT
BECAUSE I WAS NOT READ INTO THAT
PROGRAM AND NOT INVOLVED.
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF LAWYERS.
THIS CASE UP AT MY LAST
HEARING -- A NUMBER OF LAWYERS
WHO WERE INVOLVED INCLUDING OF
JUDICIAL NOMINEES AND I RECALL
SENATOR DERBIN ASKING IF I WAS
INVOLVED AS THESE OTHER JUDICIAL
NOMINEES WAS AND THAT ANSWER IS
NO AND THAT ANSWER WAS ACCURATE
AND HAS BEEN SHOWN AS ACCURATE
BY SENATOR FEINSTEIN'S REPORT.
THAT REPORT IS AN IMPORTANT
PIECE OF WORK THAT COLLECTED
FACTS ABOUT A PROGRAM WITHIN
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO
KNOW THOSE FACTS FOR THE FUTURE
AND I KNOW IT WAS AN ENORMOUS
EFFORT AND A LOT OF TOUGH WORK
TO GET ALL OF THAT INFORMATION
FOR SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND WILL
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, BUT I
HAVE LOOKED THROUGH THAT REPORT
AND LOOKED THROUGH THE OFFICE OF
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY
REPORT.
I WAS NOT READ INTO THAT
PROGRAM, SENATOR.
THANK YOU FOR -- THANK YOU FOR
ASKING.
>> OKAY.
YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF
MISLEADING THIS COMMITTEE
REGARDING YOUR ROLE IN
DEVELOPING THE BUSH
ADMINISTRATION DETENTION POLICY.
NOW, YOU HAVE A STRONG
REPUTATION IN THE LEGAL
COMMUNITY FOR HONESTY AND
INTEGRITY.
IF YOU READ ANY ONE OF THE
DOZENS OF LETTERS SUPPORTINGIOR
NOMINATION AND YOU SEE THAT
RIGHT AWAY -- SUPPORTING YOUR
NOMINATION RIGHT AWAY.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE
OPPORTUNITY NOW.
DID YOU MISLEAD THIS COMMITTEE
IN 2006?
IF NOT, WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF
THE CONFUSION ABOUT YOUR PRIOR
TESTIMONY?
>> I TOLD THE TRUTH.
I WAS NOT READ INTO THAT
PROGRAM.
THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS OF
SENATOR FEINSTEIN AND OFFICE OF
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY SHOW
THAT.
AND THAT IS WHAT I DID THEN, I
WAS NOT READ INTO THAT PROGRAM.
>> OKAY AS I MENTIONED, IN MY
OPENING STATEMENT, 18 OF YOUR
FORMER WOMEN LAW CLERKS HAVE
WRITTEN TO THE COMMITTEE IN
SUPPORT OF YOUR NOMINATION.
THAT'S ALL OF YOUR FORMER WOMEN
LAW CLERKS WHO WERE NOT
PRECLUDED BY THEIR CURRENT
EMPLOYMENT FROM SIGNING THE
LETTER.
THESE WOMEN DESCRIBE THE
MENTORING AND ENCOURAGEMENT
YOU'VE GIVEN THEM IN THEIR
CAREERS.
AND THEY SAY THAT YOU ARE QUOTE
ONE OF THE STRONGEST ADVOCATS
IN THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY FOR
WOMEN LAWYERS, UNQUOTE.
THE MAJORITY OF YOUR EMPLOYEES
HAVE BEEN WOMEN.
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE THE FIRST
IN THE DC CIRCUIT TO HAVE AN ALL
FEMALE CLASS OF CLERKS.
WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THE IMPORTANT
TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG WOMEN LAWYERS
AND ENCOURAGE YOUNG MEN AND
WOMEN ARE REPRESENTED IN THE
LEGAL PROFESSION?
>> SENATOR, I BELIEVE IN
EQUALITY.
QUALITY FOR ALL AMERICANS,
REGARDLESS OF RACE,IS ETHNICITY.
I DESCRIBED BREAKING BARRIERS
FIRST ON TEACHING AT MCKINLEY
TECH, THEN WHEN SHE BECAME A
LAWYER IN THE LATE '70s, THERE
WERE NOT MANY WOMEN PROSECUTORS
AT THE TIME, DEFINITELY MALE
DOMINATED AND HOW SHE OVERCAME
BARRIERS.
SHE WAS A GREAT PROSECUTOR.
SHE SHOWED ME BY HER EXAMPLE THE
IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN'S EQUALITY.
DURING COLLEGE, YOU'VE RECEIVED
ALERTER FROM TEN COLLEGE
FRIENDS -- A LETTER FROM TEN
COLLEGE FRIENDS OF MINE FROM
YALE AND HOW I TALKED ABOUT THEM
AND WOMEN'S SPORTS WITH RESPECT
AND AS EQUAL EVEN WHEN I WAS IN
COLLEGE.
YOU HAVE A LETTER FROM FROM 84
WOMEN I WORKED WITH FROM THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION WHO TALKED
ABOUT MY EFFORTS TO WORK WITH
THEM AND THE TENSE ENVIRONMENT
OF THE WEST WING, ESPECIALLY
AFTER SEPTEMBER 11th.
>> DID YOU SAY 84?
>> 84 WOMEN SIGNED A LETTER WHO
WORKED IN THE BUSH WHITE
HOUSE -- IN THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE
AND WORK IN THAT TENSE
ENVIRONMENT BUT I CAME TO BE A
JUDGE IN 2006, MAY 2006, AND
AUGUST 2006, LINDA GREENHOUSE,
RUNS A STORY IN THE "NEW YORK
TIMES" ABOUT THE SCARCITY OF
WOMEN LAW CLERKS AT THE SUPREME
COURT THAT YEAR.
THERE WERE SEVEN I BELIEVE THAT
YEAR OUT OF 37.
AND SHE WROTE A STORY ABOUT THAT
AND THAT SEEMED VERY ODD AND
UNACCEPTABLE AND I STARTED
THINKING ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO.
FIRST OF ALL WHY IS THAT
HAPPENING AND WHAT COULD I DO
ABOUT IT?
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM AND WHAT
COULD I DO?
THE PROBLEM SEEMED TO ME THESE
NETWORKS PEOPLE, JUDGES RELY ON
FOR CLERK HIRINGS AND PROFESSOR
NETWORKS WERE GETTING -- WERE
EXCLUDING WOMEN OR WOMEN WEREN'T
FULLY REPRESENTED IN THOSE.
I MADE SURE WHEN I WAS TALKING
TO PROFESSORS AT LAW SCHOOLS, I
WANTED TO SEE A BROAD POOL OF
QUALIFIED -- WELL QUALIFIED
APPLICANTS, INCLUDING WOMEN, AND
IN THAT YEAR FOR EXAMPLE, FALL
2006 I'M HIRING AHEAD FOR 2007.
I HIRED THREE WOMEN FOR THAT
CLERK CLASS 2007 WOMEN, THREE
OUT OF THE FOUR.
THAT WAS THE START OF MY EFFORTS
TO MAKE SURE WOMEN WERE NOT
BEING EXCLUDED AND I REALLY
WORKED ON WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
SO YALE LAW WOMEN STUDIED ABOUT
FIVE YEARS AGO ABOUT
PARTICIPATION IN CLASS, THE
DIFFERENCES ON WHO GETS CALLED
IN ON CLASS AND THERE IS SLIGHT
DIFFERENCES THERE.
MEN AND WOMEN WHO THEN GET
SELECTED AS RESEARCH ASSISTANTS,
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES THERE, AND IT
JUST KEEPS BUILDING UNTIL YOU
GET A DISPARITY IN THE CLERK
NETWORK.
AND THERE IS A PIPELINE PROBLEM.
I'VE SAID I'M BREAKING THROUGH
THAT PROBLEM.
I'M NOT -- I'M NOT LISTENING TO
THAT.
AND SO I'VE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE
ABOUT HEURING THE BEST AND
UNDERSTANDING THE BEST INCLUDE
WOMEN -- HIRING THE BEST AND THE
BEST INCLUDE WOMEN AND AS YOU
SAY, SENATOR, A MAJORITY OF MY
CLERKS HAVE BEEN WOMEN.
25 -- I BELIEVE 21 OF THEM HAVE
GONE ON TO CLERK AT THE SUPREME
COURT AND THEY'RE AN AWESOME
GROUP AND IF CONFIRMED TO THE
SUPREME COURT, I WILL CONTINUE
TO DO THIS.
WHAT IT TAKES -- AND I THINK --
MY MOM SHOWED ME THIS, PRESIDENT
BUSH SHOWED ME THIS A LITTLE.
WHAT IT TAKES IS JUST NOT
ACCEPTING THE SAME OLD ANSWER,
OH, THERE IS A DISPARITY.
WELL, WHY AND THEN DO SOMETHING
ABOUT IT.
AND I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHY
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT MINORITY
CLERKS, TOO, BUT ON WOMEN, WHY
WERE THOSE DISPARITIES EXISTING
AS DESCRIBED BY LINDA
GREENHOUSE.
AND I TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHY
AND I DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT BECAUSE I
DO BELIEVE THAT ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY AND
THE LAW CLERK POSITION, WHICH
MAY SOUND MINISTERIAL, INTO SOME
EXTENT, THE JOB IS HELPING THE
JOB AND CERTAINLY OUT OF LAW
SCHOOL, BUT THOSE POSITIONS ARE
VERY IMPORTANT LAUNCHING PADS
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF
LEADERS.
THE PEOPLE WILL BE SITTING IN
THESE SEATS.
PEOPLE WILL BE SITTING IN MY
SEAT.
LOTS OF THEM ARE GOING TO COME
IF LAW CLERKS SO IF WE'RE NOT
BEING INCLUSIVE NOW, THAT'LL
SHOW UP LATER.
IT'S BEEN A CRITICAL PART I'M
ALL FOCUSED AT ALL TIMES, IS A
QUALITY IN THE CLERKSHIP PROCESS
AND MAKING SURE WOMEN ARE
GETTING THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES
THAT MEN ARE.
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.
>> AND THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER.
I THINK IT DISTINGUISHES YOU.
LATE LAST YEAR, ALLEGATIONS
AGAINST THE FORMER 9th CIRCUIT
JUDGE, WOMEN DETAILED AN ARTICLE
DETAILING DISTURBING CONDUCT BY
THE JUDGE.
YOU CLERKED FOR HIM FOR ONE YEAR
IN 1991-1992.
SOME OF YOUR OPPONENTS HAVE
SUGGESTED YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN
ABOUT THESE ALLEGATIONS.
THIS SEEMS TO BE AN EFFORT GUILT
BY ASSOCIATION, WHICH IS NOT THE
WAYS THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD
OPERATE AT ANY WAY.
WITH THAT IN MIND I WANT TO GIVE
YOU A CHANCE TO ANSWER A FEW
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE JUDGE SO
WE'RE OPERATING ON THE SAME
FOUNDATION EFFECTS.
FIRST, HOW LONG YOU HAVE KNOWN
JUDGE KEZINSKY?
>> I CLERKED FOR HIM 1991-'92.
SECOND I UNDER FROM MEDIA
REPORTS THE JUDGE OPERATED AN
E-MAIL LIST WHERE HE WOULD SEND
INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL.
WERE YOU ON THIS E-MAIL LIST?
>> I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
LIKE THAT, SENATOR.
>> HOW OFTEN DID YOU TALK WITH
THE JUDGE ON THE PHONE?
>> NOT OFTEN.
NOT OFTEN, SIR.
>> HOW OFTEN DID YOU SEE HIM IN
PERSON?
>> AGAIN, NOT OFTEN.
MAYBE WHEN THERE WAS A LEGAL
CONVENTION OR --
>> THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE
DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND.
>> I WAS NOT WORKING -- HE WAS
IN THE PASADENA COURTHOUSE IN
CALIFORNIA WITH -- A SMALL
COURTHOUSE WITH TEN OTHER COURT
OF APPEALS JUDGES IN THAT
COURTHOUSE.
I OF COURSE WAS WORKING IN
WASHINGTON, D.C.
>> WHEN YOU DID SEE AND TALK
WITH JUDGE KEZINSKY, WHAT TYPE
OF THINGS DID YOU TALK ABOUT?
>> WE WERE AMONG THE 12
COAUTHORS OF THE BRIAN GARNER
LED BOOK ON JUDICIAL PRECEDENT,
SO FOR LEVEL YEARS THAT WAS A
PROJECT ALL OF US WERE -- THE 12
OF US I GUESS IT WAS IN TOTAL
WERE WORKING ON THAT.
DIANE WOOD CHIEF JUDGE OF THE
SEVENTH CIRCUIT AND JUSTICE
GORSUCH WAS A COAUTHOR SO WE
WORKED WITH THAT AS A GROUP AND
JUSTICE KENNEDY FOR THE LAST
30 YEARS, HAD JUDGE KEZINSKY RUN
HIS -- RUN JUSTICE KENNEDY'S LAW
CLERK HIRING PROCESS AND IN THE
COURSE OF THAT PROCESS, I WOULD
HAVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE
JUDGE.
>> OKAY.
DID YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THESE ALLEGATIONS?
>> NOTHING.
>> OKAY.
BEFORE THEY BECAME PUBLIC LAST
YEAR?
>> NO.
WHEN THEY BECAME PUBLIC, NO, THE
FIRST THOUGHT I HAD WAS NO WOMAN
SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL
HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE
EVER, INCLUDING IN JUDICIARY,
ESPECIALLY IN THE JUDICIARY.
AND WHEN I HEARD -- WHEN IT
BECAME PUBLIC, I THINK IT WAS IN
DECEMBER, IT WAS A GUT PUNCH.
IT WAS A GUT PUNCH FOR ME.
>> IT WAS MORE ME, TOO.
>> IT WAS A GUN PUNCH FOR THE
JUDICIARY AND I WAS SHOCKED AND
DISAPPOINTED, ANGRY, SWIRLED
EMOTIONS.
NO WOMAN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE
WORKPLACE AND I APPLAUD CHIEF
JUSTICE ROBERTS APPOINTED
COMMITTEE OF JUDGES TO ESTABLISH
BETTER PROCEDURES.
CHIEF JUDGE SCARWIN DID THE SAME
THING FOR OUR COURT AND THOSE
ARE FIRST STEPS.
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE FINAL
STEPS BY ANY STRETCH.
AND WHAT -- THIS IS PART OF A
MUCH LARGER NATIONAL PROBLEM OF
ABUSE AND HARASSMENT AND ONE OF
THE THINGS WE'VE LEARNED IS WE
NEED BETTER REPORTING
MECHANISMS, WOMEN IN PARTICULAR
IN THE WORKPLACE, NEED TO KNOW
IF THEY'RE THE VICTIM OF
HARASSMENT, WHERE TO REPORT IT,
IMMEDIATELY WHO TO REPORT IT TO.
THEY NEED TO BE KNOWN -- KNOW
THEY'LL BE SAFE IF THEY REPORT
IT.
THEY NEED TO HAVE A SAFE WORKING
ENVIRONMENT AND BE SAFE IF THEY
REPORT IT.
THEY WON'T BE RETALIATED AGAINST
AND THEY'LL BE PROTECTED IF THEY
REPORT IT AND THAT'S PART OF THE
STEPS -- OR ONE OF THE STEPS
THAT'S I THINK BEING IMPROVED AS
A RESULT OF THE WORKING GROUP,
OR COMMITTEE, THAT CHIEF
JUSTICES APPOINTED AND I'M
INTERESTED IN DOING EVERYTHING I
CAN TO ASSIST THOSE EFFORTS TO
MAKE THOSE WORKPLACES SAFE.
AGAIN IT'S PART OF A BROADER
NATIONAL PROBLEM, WHETHER IT'S
PRIESTS, OR TEACHERS, OR
COACHES, OR DOCTORS, OR
BUSINESSPEOPLE, OR NEWS PEOPLE
THERE IS A BROAD NATIONAL
PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE
ADDRESSED INCLUDING IN THE
JUDICIARY.
I APPLAUD CHIEF JUSTICE FOR
DOING SO.
.
>> IF THE LAW IS AMBIGUOUS. 
SOME OF YOUR WRITINGS EXPRESS 
SKEPTICISM. BY AVOIDING THE 
POLITICAL PROCESS -- I CAN 
UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WOULD BE 
APPEALING TO AN ADMINISTRATION. 
BUT I ALSO THINK IT IS A THREAT 
TO THE SEPARATION OF POWERS. 
IT TRANSFERS POWER FROM 
CONGRESS TO THE EXECUTIVE 
BRANCH. 
THAT'S WHY I'VE ASKED TO 
REVERSE THAT DOCTRINE. 
MANY MEMBERS HAVE COSPONSORED 
THIS LEGISLATION. 
AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS WRITTEN 
ABOUT THE SEPARATION OF POWERS, 
CAN YOU TELL US WHY THE 
SEPARATION IS SO IMPORTANT AND 
HOW IT PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL 
FREEDOM? 
>> IT PROTECTS INDIVIDUAL 
LIBERTY. 
BECAUSE IT RESPONSE TO THE 
CONCERN THE FRAMERS HAVE THAT 
SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR SAID. 
IT WILL BE THE DEFINITION OF 
TYRANNY YOU CAN'T ENFORCE THE 
LAWS. 
AND THEN EVEN IF THE LAW IS 
ENFORCED AND A CITIZEN MAY SAY, 
I WANT SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T PASS 
A LAW OR ENFORCE IT TO DECIDE 
IF I VIOLATED THE LAW OR IF IT 
IS CONSTITUTIONAL. 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE AN 
INDEPENDENT JUDICIARY TO 
GUARANTEE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES. 
THE THREE BRANCHES THERE TWO 
SEPARATE THINGS BECAUSE IT ALL 
TILTS TOWARDS LIBERTY. 
IT IS HARD TO PASS A LAW, AS 
YOU KNOW, IN CONGRESS. 
EVEN IF IT DOES GET PAST A 
SEPARATE -- PASSED A SEPARATE 
BODY DOES THAT. 
AND THEN EVEN IF THAT HAPPENS, 
YOU GO TO COURT AND SAY I 
DIDN'T VIOLATE THAT LAW AS I'M 
ACCUSED OR THAT LAW IS 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR THEY ARE 
INTERPRETING THAT LAW IN A WAY 
THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE 
WAY THE LAW SAYS. 
THE COURT DECIDES THAT. 
IT'S NOT THE MEMBERS OF 
CONGRESS OR THE EXECUTIVE 
DECIDING THAT. 
THAT'S HOW THE SEPARATION OF 
POWERS TILT TOWARDS LIBERTY IN 
ALL RESPECTS. 
AS TO YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION, 
SENATOR, ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE 
SEEN IN MY EXPERIENCE IS A 
NATURAL TENDENCY, ONE THAT 
JUDGES NEED TO BE AWARE OF AND 
RESPOND TO. 
HERE'S THE NATURAL TENDENCY. 
CONGRESS PASSES LAWS. 
BUT THEN THEY CAN'T UPDATE THE 
LAWS. 
MAYBE IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL 
LAW OR MAYBE SOME KIND OF LAW 
DEALING WITH NATIONAL SECURITY. 
LET'S TAKE THOSE TWO EXAMPLES 
TO ILLUSTRATE. 
AND THEN, AN AGENCY WANTS TO DO 
SOME NEW POLICY AND PROPOSES A 
NEW POLICY TO CONGRESS. 
BUT CONGRESS DOESN'T PASS THE 
NEW POLICY. 
WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS OR TOO OFTEN 
I'VE SEEN, THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
THEN RESULTS RELIES ON THE OLD 
LAW. 
THE OLD LAW IS AMBIGUOUS. 
WE CAN FIT THIS NEW POLICY INTO 
THE OLD LAW AS JUSTIFICATION 
FOR DOING THIS NEW THING. 
I HAVE SEEN THIS IN NATIONAL 
SECURITY CASES, YOU SEE IT ALL 
OVER THE PLACE. 
IT IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON. 
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WANTS TO 
IMPLEMENT WHAT IT THINKS IS 
GOOD POLICY. 
NOW IN THOSE CASES COME TO 
COURT, IT IS OUR JOB TO FIGURE 
OUT IF THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAS 
ACTED WITHIN THE AUTHORITY 
GIVEN TO IT WITHIN CONGRESS. 
HAVE YOU GIVEN THEM THE 
AUTHORITY? 
IT IS ROOTED IN RESPECT FOR 
CONGRESS. 
HAVE YOU PASSED THE LAW TO GIVE 
THE AUTHORITY? 
I HAVE HEARD IT SAID I AM A 
SKEPTIC OF REGULATION. 
I AM NOT A SKEPTIC OF 
REGULATION, AT ALL. 
I'M A SKEPTIC OF UNAUTHORIZED 
REGULATION. 
REGULATION THAT IS OUTSIDE THE 
BONDS OF LOSS BY CONGRESS -- 
LAWS BY CONGRESS. 
>> OKAY. 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 
QUALITIES I LOOK FOR IN A 
NOMINEE IS THE ABILITY TO 
IMPARTIALLY INTERPRET THE LAW. 
AND ALSO APPLY IT TO THE CASE 
BEFORE THE COURT. 
NOW THIS CAN OFTEN BE THE MOST 
DIFFICULT PART OF A JOB. 
IT MAY REQUIRE THE JUDGE TO 
RULE AGAINST A LITIGANT THAT 
COULD BE SYMPATHETIC OR AGAINST 
A POLICY THAT THE JUDGE MAY 
PERSONALLY AGREE WITH. 
SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER COMMENDED 
HER FOR HEWING CAREFULLY TO THE 
TEXT OF STATUTES EVEN WHEN IT 
RESULTS IN RULINGS THAT GO 
AGAINST SYMPATHETIC LITIGANTS. 
DO YOU BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT 
FOR A JUDGE TO INTERPRET AND 
APPLY THE LAWS THAT CONGRESS 
HAS PASSED RATHER THAN SEEKING 
TO MAKE A CHANGE? 
IF THE JUDGE DOESN'T LIKE WITH 
THE CONGRESS HAS DONE? 
IF SO, WHY OR WHY NOT? 
>> I AGREE COMPLETELY, SENATOR. 
THAT'S A FOUNDATION IS THE 
PROPER JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHY. 
>> OKAY. 
>> THE SYSTEM YOU DESCRIBED, WE 
HAVE TO STICK TO THE LAWS 
PASSED BY CONGRESS. 
YOU MAKE THE POLICY. 
WE'LL FOLLOW THE POLICY 
DIRECTION THAT YOU PUT INTO THE 
LOSS THAT ARE ENACTED, PAST BY 
THE HOUSE AND SENATE AND SIGNED 
BY THE PRESIDENT. 
WE DON'T RELATE -- REWRITE 
THOSE LAWS. 
>> OKAY. SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES 
HAVE CRITICIZED YOU FOR RULING 
TOO OFTEN AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL 
INTEREST. 
IT SEEMS MANY OF THESE 
CIRCUMSTANCES BOIL DOWN TO THE 
FACT THAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES 
DON'T LIKE THE LAWS THAT 
CONGRESS HAS PASSED AND ARE 
FRUSTRATED THEY HAVEN'T BEEN 
ABLE TO GET THEIR OWN POLICIES 
SIGNED INTO LAW. 
I'VE LOOK THROUGH YOUR RECORD. 
AND I FOUND THAT YOU HAVE NOT 
HESITATED AT ALL TO UPHOLD 
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WHEN 
THEY WERE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED 
BY STATUTE. 
COULD YOU GIVE US A FEW 
EXAMPLES OF CASES WHERE YOU 
HAVE UPHELD ENVIRONMENTAL 
REGULATIONS BECAUSE YOU 
CONCLUDED THAT CONGRESS HAS 
AUTHORIZED THEM? 
>> LIMIT IT TO AS MANY AS YOU 
CAN BECAUSE OF TIME. 
>> SENATOR, AS I SAID 
YESTERDAY, I'M APRIL LAW JUDGE. 
IN ENVIRONMENTAL CASES -- APRIL 
LAW JUDGE. 
IN MANY CASES I HAVE VOTED FOR 
ENVIRONMENTAL INTEREST. 
I UPHELD A CALIFORNIA 
REGULATION FOR MATURITY OVER A 
DISSENT, STRICTER AIR QUALITY 
STANDARDS IN THE NATIONAL 
ASSOCIATIONS CASE. 
EPA RULES FOR PARTICULATE MATTER
. PERMIT PROCESSOR FOR SURFACE 
COAL MINING. THE ENERGY CASE, 
REJECTING A PREMATURE CHALLENGE 
TO A CLEAN POWERPLANT 
REGULATION. 
THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE 
CASE AGAINST THE EPA. 
THAT WAS A BIG-MONEY CASE WHERE 
THE INDUSTRY WANTED AN 
CONFRONTATIVE DEFENSE TO BE 
CREATED. 
THE DEFENSE WAS NOT IN THE 
STATUTES PASSED BY CONGRESS. 
THE INDUSTRY CAME IN WITH THEIR 
LAWYERS AND SAID JUST RIGHT JOB 
THE DEFENSE INTO THE LAW. 
-- WRITE THAT INTO THE LAW. 
NO. 
THAT'S NOT IN THE LAW. 
WE FOLLOW THE LAW REGARDLESS. 
THERE ARE LARGE NUMBER OF CASES 
WHERE I'VE RULED IN FAVOR OF 
ENVIRONMENTALIST INTERESTS 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE LAW 
REQUIRED IN THAT CASE. 
>> JUDGE, I PERSONALLY -- 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. 
YOU HAVE DONE A LOT OF 
PREPARATION WITH A COUPLE 
REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES ABOUT THE 
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT BE ASKED. 
BUT LET ME ASK YOU, SOMETHING 
THAT NORMALLY ISN'T AN ISSUE 
DURING THE SUPREME COURT 
HEARINGS. 
YOU TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS 
COMMITTEE IN BOTH 2004 AND 2006 
AS PART OF YOUR NOMINATION TO 
THE D.C. CIRCUIT COURT. 
AND YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH TO 
COME BY MY OFFICE AND CHAT WITH 
ME LAST MONTH. 
I ASKED YOU IF YOU CHANGE 
ANYTHING IN YOUR PRIOR TESTIMONY
. YOU SAID NO. 
IS THAT STILL YOUR POSITION? 
>> IT IS, SENATOR. 
I TOLD THE TRUTH. 
>> NO, NO, NO. 
I'M JUST ASKING IF YOU WOULD 
CHANGE ANYTHING? 
>> I WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND IF I 
CAN. 
>> I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A 
CHANCE. 
GO AHEAD. 
>> I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN THAT
AT THE LAST HEARING IN 2006 IN 
PARTICULAR, YOU WERE CONCERNED, 
UNDERSTANDABLY, THERE HAD BEEN 
TWO NOMINEES WHO HAD BEEN 
INVOLVED IN THE LEGAL MEMOS AND 
DISCUSSIONS AROUND CRAFTING THE 
ENHANCED DETENTION POLICIES. 
YOU ARE CONCERNED IF I ALSO WAS 
INVOLVED IN THOSE. 
AND I MADE CLEAR IN RESPONSE TO 
THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WAS NOT IN 
THAT PROGRAM. 
THAT WAS 100% ACCURATE. 
IT IS STILL ACCURATE TODAY. 
I THINK THE REPORT ESTABLISHED 
THAT I WAS NOT INVOLVED IN 
THOSE PROGRAMS. 
THERE WERE TWO NOMINEES. 
>> I'M GOING TO GO INTO THAT IN 
A BIT. 
I DON'T WANT TO GO OVER MY TIME 
AS THE PRECEDING SENATOR DID. 
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND 
REASSURE YOU. 
>> I'M GOING TO GO INTO THAT. 
>> LET ME. 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE TIME 
AWAY. 
>> LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING. 
IF IT QUESTION IS ASKED WITHIN 
THE 30 MINUTES, HE CAN FINISH 
THE QUESTION AND IT CAN BE 
ANSWERED. 
SO, HE DID NOT GO OVER HIS TIME.
>> SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT 
A SENSITIVE AREA. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
BETWEEN 2001 -- I'M NEW HERE. 
 BETWEEN 2001 AND 
2003, TWO REPUBLICAN STAFFERS 
ON THIS COMMITTEE HACKED INTO 
THE PRIVATE COMPUTER FILES OF 
SIX SENATORS INCLUDING MINE. 
THESE REPUBLICAN STAFFERS 
STALLED -- STOLE FILES AND USE 
THEM TO ASSIST IN GETTING 
PRESIDENT BUSH'S MOST -- 
CONFIRMED. 
IT BECAME PUBLIC IN LATE 2003. 
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL PRINTED 
SOME OF THE STOLEN MATERIALS. 
THE RINGLEADER BEHIND THIS THEFT
WAS A REPUBLICAN STAFFER WHO 
WOULD WORK FOR ONE OF THE 
MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. 
IT WAS CONSIDERED AS A DIGITAL 
WATERGATE AND A THEFT NOT 
UNLIKE WHAT THE RUSSIANS DID. 
DURING ALL THIS YOU WORKED HAND 
IN HAND IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH 
MANNY MIRANDA.  
NOT SURPRISINGLY, YOU WERE 
ASKED EXTENSIVELY ABOUT YOUR 
KNOWLEDGE OF THIS THEFT DURING 
BOTH YOUR 2004 AND 2006 
HEARINGS. 
I DON'T USE THE WORD 
EXTENSIVELY LIGHTLY. 
YOU ARE ASKED OVER 100 QUESTIONS
FROM SENATORS. 
AND YOU TESTIFIED REPEATEDLY 
THAT YOU NEVER RECEIVED ANY 
STOLEN MATERIALS. 
YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT UNTIL 
IT WAS PUBLIC. 
YOU TESTIFIED IF YOU HAD 
SUSPECTED ANYTHING, YOU WOULD 
HAVE REPORTED IT TO THE COUNCIL.
THEY WOULD'VE RAISE THAT WITH 
SENATOR HATCH. 
AT THE TIME, WE LEFT IT THERE. 
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER. 
TODAY, WITH A VERY LIMITED 
AMOUNT OF YOUR RECORD, AND IT 
IS LIMITED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEARN 
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH 
MR. MIRANDA AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE 
OF THESE EVENTS. 
SO MY QUESTION IS THIS, DID MR. 
MIRANDA EVER PROVIDE YOU WITH 
HIGHLY SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
REGARDING WHAT I OR OTHER 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS ARE 
PLANNING TO ASK TO CERTAIN 
NOMINEES? 
>> SENATOR, LET ME CONTEXTUALIZE
AS I'M LOOKING AT WHAT YOU'RE 
ú 
-- PUTTING UP HERE FIRST. 
>> THE QUESTION IS -- 
>> WHAT IS UP THERE, IS 100% 
ACCURATE. 
AS TO MY MEMORY. 
>> OKAY. 
LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
>> I NEVER KNEW OR SUSPECTED. 
TRUE. 
NEVER SUSPECTED ANYTHING. 
TRUE. 
HAD I SUSPECTED THINKING 
ANYTHING, I WOULD'VE TALK TO 
THE JUDGE. 
THAT'S ALL 100% TRUE. 
>> AND THAT'S WHAT I ALREADY 
SAID. 
BUT DID MR. MIRANDA EVER 
PROVIDE YOU WITH HIGHLY 
SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING 
WHAT I OR OTHER DEMOCRATIC 
SENATORS ARE PLANNING IN THE 
FUTURE TO ASK CERTAIN NOMINEES? 
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD 
DO AS A WHITE HOUSE IS ON 
NOMINATIONS -- AND COMING TO 
YOUR ANSWER BUT I WANT TO 
EXPLAIN, IS TO MEET A.. 
AND THIS HAPPENS ON -- MEET UP 
HERE. 
AND THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. 
THEY ARE COMING UP. HOW ARE WE 
GOING TO GET THEM THROUGH. 
HERE'S A HEARING COMING UP. 
AND DURING THOSE MEETINGS, OF 
COURSE, IT WOULD BE DISCUSSED. 
HERE IS WHAT SENATOR LEAHY IS 
GOING TO BE  INTERESTED IN. 
THAT'S VERY, -- VERY COMMON. 
I THINK THIS IS WHAT SENATOR 
GRAHAM WILL BE INTERESTED IN. 
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IN MEETINGS 
WITH -- HIGHLY SPECIFIC WOULD 
-- I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE 
GETTING AT. 
>> I HAVE BEEN HERE OVER 40 
YEARS. 
I KNOW WHAT BOTH 
ADMINISTRATIONS DO IN 
PREPARING. 
I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT THAT. 
I'M ASKING YOU WHY BEFORE THIS 
DID MR. MIRANDA SEND YOU AN 
EMAIL ASKING YOU ON JULY 19, 
2002, ASKING YOU AND ANOTHER 
BUSH OFFICIAL WHY THE LEAHY 
PEOPLE WERE LOOKING INTO 
FINANCIAL TIES  BETWEEN TWO 
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS AND 
PRISCILLA OWN -- OWEN. 
SHE HAD RECEIVED A LOT OF 
CONTRIBUTIONS. 
DID MR. MIRANDA SEND YOU AN 
EMAIL ASKING YOU WHY THE LEAHY 
WERE LOOKING INTO HER FINANCIAL 
TIES?  
>> IS THAT WHAT THIS EMAIL IS? 
>> I'M JUST ASKING YOU. 
>> CAN I TAKE A MINUTE TO READ 
THIS? 
>> OF COURSE. 
>> OKAY. 
>> AND THIS WAS FOUR DAYS 
BEFORE THE HEARING ON JULY 23. 
>> DID I SEND ANY OF THE EMAILS 
ON THIS CHAIN? 
I DON'T THINK SO. 
I THINK I AM CC'ED. 
IN ANY EVENT, IF YOU SAID WHY 
ARE THE LEAHY PEOPLE LOOKING 
INTO THIS,  FROM MANNY MIRANDA  
-- I DON'T REALLY HAVE A 
SPECIFIC RECOLLECTION OF ANY 
THIS, SENATOR. 
IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AT ALL 
UNUSUAL FOR -- AND THIS HAPPENS 
ALL THE TIME, I THINK. 
THE LEAHY PEOPLE LOOKING INTO 
THIS  AND THE HATCH PEOPLE ARE 
LOOK INTO THAT. 
I THINK. 
>> YOU SAY ALL THE TIME BUT TWO 
DAYS BEFORE THE HEARING THEY 
TOLD YOU THE DEMOCRATS WERE 
PASSING AROUND A STORY SAYING 
IT IS INTEL. 
SUGGESTING THAT LEAHY  WILL 
FOCUS ON ALL THINGS MONEY. 
WELL, THAT APPEARS TO COME FROM 
A STOLEN EMAIL TO ME, STOLEN BY 
THE STAFF MEMBER SENT TO ME THE 
NIGHT BEFORE AND THEN GIVEN TO 
YOU THE NEXT MORNING. 
WERE YOU AWARE THAT YOU ARE 
GETTING STOLEN EMAILS? 
>> NOT AT ALL, SENATOR. 
IT WAS PART OF WHAT APPEARED TO 
BE STANDAR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT --
IT IS COMMON, SENATOR, AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE -- IT TO A BIG 
COMMON TO HEAR FROM THE AFFAIRS 
TEAM. 
IN THIS PROCESS, IT IS, TO HEAR 
THAT. 
THIS IS WHAT THAT SENATOR IS 
INTERESTED IN. 
THE IS IT COMMON TO HAVE -- 
>> IS IT COMMON TO HAVE A 
PRIVATE EMAIL SENT TO A 
PARTICULAR SENATOR? 
>> COPIES OF A PRIVATE EMAIL 
SENT TO A PARTICULAR SENATOR? 
>> YES. 
WOULDN'T THAT JUMP OUT AT YOU? 
>> WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO? 
>> MR. MIRANDA'S TELLING YOU 
ABOUT EMAILS SENT TO ME THE 
NIGHT BEFORE. 
THERE WOULD BE NO WAY HE WOULD 
HAVE THAT IN LESS HE STOLE IT. 
DID THAT RAISE ANY QUESTION? 
>> DID HE REFER TO THE EMAIL IN 
THIS? 
>> YES. 
>> WHERE IS THAT, SENATOR? 
>> I WILL LET YOU READ IT. 
>> I'M NOT SEEING WHERE YOU -- 
I'M NOT SEEING WHAT YOU ARE 
REFERRING TO. 
>> THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF 
MATERIAL THE REPUBLICANS ARE 
ALLOWING US TO SEE OF YOUR 
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU, AT LEAST 
WOULD COME THROUGH. 
IN JANUARY 2003, -- LET ME GO 
INTO SOMETHING SPECIFIC. 
MR. MIRANDA REPORTED IT TO TOM 
DASCHLE. 
THE LETTER WAS CLEARLY A DRAFT. 
IT HAD TYPOS. 
AND IT WAS NOT SIGNED. 
SOMEBODY EVENTUALLY -- WE NEVER 
PUT IT OUT BUT SOMEBODY 
EVENTUALLY LEAKED IT TO FOX 
NEWS. 
I'M NOT SURE WHO, I COULD GUESS.
IT WAS A PRIVATE LETTER. 
I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT IT 
EXISTED AT THE TIME. 
IT HAD BEEN LEAKED. 
HERE'S THE THING. 
YOU HAD THE FULL TEXT IN YOUR 
INBOX BEFORE ANYTHING HAD BEEN 
SAID ABOUT IT PUBLICLY. 
DID YOU FIND IT AT ALL UNUSUAL 
TO RECEIVE A DRAFT LETTER FROM 
DEMOCRATIC SENATORS TO EACH 
OTHER BEFORE ANY MENTION OF IT 
WAS MADE PUBLIC? 
>> THE ONLY THING I SAID ON THE 
EMAIL EXCHANGE IF I'M LOOKING 
AT QUICKLY, SENATOR, WAS WHO 
SIGNED THIS. 
WHICH WOULD IMPLY THAT I 
THOUGHT IT WAS A SIGNED LETTER. 
>> WERE YOU SURPRISED TO GET IT?
IT'S OBVIOUSLY A DRAFT. 
IT HAS TYPOS AND EVERYTHING 
ELSE. 
WERE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE 
DRAFT LETTER CIRCULATED AMONG 
DEMOCRATS AND ENDED UP IN YOUR 
INBOX? 
>> BUT I -- I THINK THE PREMISE 
OF YOUR QUESTION IS NOT 
ACCURATELY DESCRIBING MY 
APPARENT RECOLLECTION OR 
UNDERSTANDING AT THE TIME. 
I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID WHO SIGNED 
THIS IF I THOUGHT IT WAS A 
DRAFT. 
MY EMAIL SAYS WHO SIGNED THIS. 
>> SO YOU DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT 
YOU HAD WAS A STOLEN LETTER 
SIGNED BY ME? 
YOU HAD A LETTER THAT HAD BEEN 
NOT SENT TO ANYBODY NOT BEEN 
MADE PUBLIC? 
>> ALL I SEE THAT I SAID WAS 
WHO SIGNED THIS. 
THAT'S ALL I SEE. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU SOME MORE. 
SO MUCH OF THIS CAME FROM MR. 
MIRANDA. 
HE WAS A REPUBLICAN STAFFER WHO 
WAS STEALING THINGS AS WE DON'T 
KNOW. 
DID HE EVER ASK TO MEET 
PRIVATELY WITH YOU AT AN OFF 
SITE LOCATION OTHER THAN THE 
WHITE HOUSE OR CAPITOL HILL? 
>> I THINK SOMETIMES, SENATOR, 
THE MEETINGS WITH SENATE 
STAFFERS AND -- 
>> I'M JUST ASKING ABOUT ONE 
PARTICULAR ONE. 
MR. MIRANDA. 
>> USUALLY IT WOULD BE AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE OR THE SENATE BUT 
SOMETIMES I THINK WE WOULD MEET 
-- OR AT THE DOJ. BUT SOMETIMES 
IT COULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE. 
>> DID HE HAS TO MEET WITH YOU 
PRIVATELY SO HE COULD GIVE YOU 
INFORMATION PRIVATELY SO HE 
COULD GIVE YOU INFORMATION 
ABOUT SENATOR BIDEN OR SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN? 
>> I'M NOT REMEMBER  -- 
REMEMBERING ANYTHING SPECIFIC 
BUT IT IS POSSIBLE. 
IT IS VERY COMMON WHEN YOU ARE 
IN THE SELECTION PROCESS TO 
DETERMINE WHAT ARE ALL THE 
SENATORS INTERESTED IN FOR THE 
UPCOMING NOMINEE OR HEARING? 
THAT IS THE COIN OF THE REALM. 
SENATOR X IS INTERESTED IN 
FOCUSING ON THIS LAW. 
SENATOR Y IS GOING TO ASK ABOUT 
ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. 
THE SENATORS CONCERNED ABOUT 
YOUR PAST WORK FOR THIS CLIENT. 
AND THAT'S VERY COMMON. 
>> DID HE EVER ASK TO HAVE YOU 
MEET HIM NOT AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE, NOT AT THE CAPITAL, IT 
IS HOME? 
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
>> DID HE EVER ASKED TO MEET 
YOU OUTSIDE OF THE WHITE HOUSE 
OR THE CAPITAL? 
>> I CAN'T RULE THAT OUT. 
BUT AGAIN, THAT WOULD NOT HAVE 
BEEN TYPICAL. 
>> DID HE EVER HAND YOU MATERIAL
SEPARATELY FROM WHAT WOULD BE 
EMAILED BACK AND FORTH? 
>> IF YOU'RE REFERRING TO 
SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR, I 
COULD ANSWER THAT BUT -- 
>> DID YOU EVER RECEIVE 
INFORMATION VIA MR. MIRANDA, 
INFORMATION MARKED CONFIDENTIAL,
THAT INFORMED YOU THAT MY STAFF 
WAS SHARING THINGS WITH OTHER 
DEMOCRATS? 
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 
THAT, SENATOR. 
BUT AGAIN, IT IS NOT ALWAYS THE 
CASE THAT THE PEOPLE WERE 
NECESSARILY WORKING AT ODDS. 
IT SEEMED LIKE A LOT OF TIMES 
THE STAFF WAS COOPERATING, AT 
TIMES, NOT AT OTHER TIMES 
OBVIOUSLY. 
BUT AT TIMES OVER NOMINATIONS. 
IT WOULDN'T HAVE RAISED 
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR IN MY 
MIND IF WE LEARNED SENATOR 
LEAHY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS. 
>>  DID MY STAFF EVER SEND YOU 
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL FROM 
SENATOR HATCH THAT WAS STOLEN 
FROM HIS EMAILS? 
>> NOT THE LAST PART BUT -- I 
CERTAINLY DID TALK TO YOUR 
STAFF WHEN I WAS WORKING ON THE 
AIRLINE BILL ON THE AIRLINE 
BILL. 
I REMEMBER BEING HERE ALL NIGHT 
ONE NIGHT WITH YOUR STAFF. 
I'M SURE WE DID TALK THAT NIGHT 
ABOUT WHAT OTHER SENATORS 
THOUGHT. 
THAT WAS THE BILL AS YOU RECALL,
SPEAKER HAS WAS INVOLVED. I 
WORKED HARD WITH YOUR STAFF ON 
THAT. 
IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON AT ALL TO 
BE TALKING WITH OUR TEAM WITH 
WHAT SENATORS ON BOTH SIDES 
THINK. 
IT DIDN'T STRIKE ME THAT IT WAS 
ALWAYS ARMED CAMPS. 
>> BUT NO -- OFTENTIMES IT WAS 
NOT. 
BUT HERE YOU ARE GETTING 
OBVIOUSLY, VERY PRIVATE 
DEMOCRATIC EMAILS. 
YOU WEREN'T CONCERNED ABOUT HOW 
MR. MIRANDA GOT THEM? 
>> I'M NOT SURE ABOUT YOUR 
PREMISE. 
>> WERE YOU ALL CONCERNED ABOUT 
WHERE HE GOT SOME OF THE 
MATERIAL HE WAS SHOWING YOU? 
>> I DON'T RECALL THAT. 
BUT ON THE PREMISE OF YOUR LAST 
QUESTION, I WANT TO STEP BACK 
TO THAT. 
I'M NOT SURE I AGREE WITH THE 
PREMISE. 
>> IF YOU'RE GETTING SOMETHING 
THAT IS MARKED CONFIDENTIAL, 
WENCH YOU ASSUME THAT IS NOT 
SOMETHING BEING SHARED BACK AND 
FORTH? 
>> UNLESS IT WAS SHARED. 
THIS IS THE THING. 
IF A STAFFER SAYS HERO -- HERE 
IS WHAT WE ARE SENDING AND YOU 
SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS BECAUSE 
WE ARE GOING TO MAKE -- WE ARE 
GOING TO BE REALLY OPPOSED TO 
THIS NOMINEE. 
TO BE CLEAR, IT SEEMED 
SOMETIMES THERE WERE NOMINEES 
YOU'RE VERY OPPOSED TO AND 
SOMETIMES YOU'RE SUPPORTIVE OF 
THEM AND SOMETIMES IN BETWEEN. 
AND THERE WOULD BE MESSAGES 
PASSED BACK AND FORTH AND 
SHARING OF INFORMATION, VERY 
COOPERATIVE. 
AS I RECALL. WHEN YOU HAD 
PROBLEMS WITH NOMINEES, I 
RECALL TRANSPARENCY. 
AND WHEN YOU WERE SUPPORTIVE, 
YOU ARE AT THE MAIN NINTH, -- 
MAY 9, 2001 EVENT. AND YOU WORK 
SUPPORTIVE OF MANY OF THEM. 
>> BUT -- I VOTED FOR A LOT OF 
REPUBLICAN NOMINEES. 
BOTH TO THE SUPREME COURT AND 
DISTRICT COURTS. 
>> YES. 
>> BUT WHAT I IMPOSED WITH 
JUDGE OWEN  AND RAISING 
QUESTIONS ABOUT FUNDING THAT 
SHE WAS GETTING FROM PEOPLE 
THAT WERE BEFORE HER COURT, THAT
MIGHT HAVE RAISED A RED FLAG 
THAT I MIGHT'VE HAD CONCERNS 
ABOUT HER. 
NOW WHEN YOU WORKED AT THE 
WHITE HOUSE, DID ANYONE EVER 
TELL YOU THEY HAD A MOLE THAT 
PROVIDED THEM WITH SECRET 
INFORMATION RELATED TO 
NOMINATIONS? 
>> I DON'T RECALL THE REFERENCE 
TO A MOLE WHICH SOUNDS HIGHLY 
SPECIFIC BUT CERTAINLY IT IS 
COMMON, AGAIN, AND THE PEOPLE 
BEHIND YOU CAN PROBABLY REFER 
TO THIS -- BUT IT IT IS, AND I 
THINK, FOR EVERYBODY TO TALK TO 
EACH OTHER AND SHARE 
INFORMATION. 
AT LEAST THIS WAS MY EXPERIENCE.
THIS WAS ALMOST 20 YEARS AGO. 
YOU WOULD TALK TO PEOPLE. 
>> YOU NEVER RECEIVED AN EMAIL 
FROM A STAFF MEMBER WITH 
INFORMATION CLAIMING TO COME 
FROM SPYING ON DEMOCRATICS? 
>> I'M NOT GOING TO RULE 
ANYTHING OUT, SENATOR. 
BUT IF I DID, I WOULDN'T HAVE 
THOUGHT THAT THE LITERAL [ 
LAUGHTER ] MEANING OF THAT. 
>> WOULDN'T IT HAVE SURPRISE 
YOU THAT YOU GOT AN EMAIL 
SAYING YOU GOT THAT FROM 
SOMEBODY SPYING -- 
>> IS THERE SUCH AN EMAIL, SIR? 
>> WE HAVE TO ASKED THE 
CHAIRMAN WHAT HE HAS IN HIS 
CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL. 
>> BUT HERE IS THE -- IF YOU'RE 
REFERRING TO SOMETHING IN 
PARTICULAR, HERE'S WHAT I KNOW 
-- 
>> JUST STOP A MINUTE. 
REFERENCED TWICE IN YOUR 30 
MINUTES. 
AND DON'T TAKE THIS OFF OF HIS 
TIME. 
YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE 
PERIOD OF TIME THAT HIS -- THAT 
MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE TO 
EVERYBODY. 
>> SO, THAT MATERIAL ABOUT HIM 
THAT IS MARKED COMMITTEE 
CONFIDENTIAL IS NOW PUBLIC AND 
AVAILABLE? 
IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING? 
THAT'S WHAT THE CHAIRMAN IS 
SAYING AND WE HAVE A WHOLE NEW 
SERIES OF QUESTIONS. 
>> NO. 
NOT COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL BUT 
JUST -- YOU HAVE ACCESS TO IT. 
NOT -- 
>> I DON'T HAVE 80% OF THE 
MATERIAL WE HAVE GOTTEN FROM 
THE LIBRARY. 
IT IS ON THE WEBSITE OF THE 
COMMITTEE SO THE PUBLIC'S 
ACCESS TO IT. 
PROCEED. 
>> I WANT -- I WANT -- I WANT 
JUDGE KAVANAUGH TO HAVE ACCESS 
TO WE CAN ASK OF THESE 
QUESTIONS UNDER OATH.  
SO I WOULD ASK THE -- AND WILL 
HAVE ANOTHER ROUND BUT I WOULD 
ASK THE CHAIRMAN TO LOOK AT 
SOME OF THESE THAT ARE MARKED 
COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL WHICH 
LIMITS THE ABILITY TO ASK YOU 
SPECIFICALLY IN HAND YOU THE 
SPECIFIC EMAILS. 
BUT I WOULD STATE WHAT HAS BEEN 
PUBLIC -- 
>> LET ME ANSWER THAT FOR YOU. 
THERE IS ONLY ONE DEMOCRATIC 
SENATOR WHO WAS ASKED FOR 
ACCESS TO THAT. 
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, YOU 
COULD'VE BEEN ASKING EVER SINCE 
AUGUST 25. 
>> WE'VE BEEN ASKING TO HAVE 
THAT MADE PUBLIC. AND I'M NOT 
AS INTERESTED IF I SEE THOSE IN 
A CLOSED ROOM WHERE I CAN'T 
TALK ABOUT IT. 
I WANT JUDGE KAVANAUGH  TO SEE 
THE EMAILS WHICH CAME FROM MR. 
MIRANDA AND -- 
>> GIVE US A CITATION OF THE 
DOCUMENTS AND WE WILL BE AT 
THEM FOR YOU. 
>> THAT TESTIMONY UP THERE IS 
TRUE. 
100%. 
>> CAN SOMEBODY READ THAT? 
I CAN'T SEE IT. 
WHAT? 
>> OF COURSE, IT WOULD BE 
HELPFUL IF WE ALLOWED THE 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES TO COMPLETE 
THE REVIEW. 
>> I JUST WANT TO REASSURE YOU, 
SENATOR, THAT WHAT YOU HAVE ON 
THE BOARD IS 100% ACCURATE. 
>> CAN SOMEBODY MOVE IT SO WE 
CAN SEE IT HERE? 
>> WELL, I'M CONCERNED. 
BECAUSE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT 
MR. MIRANDA PROVIDED YOU WITH 
MATERIALS THAT WERE STOLEN FROM 
ME. 
AND THAT WOULD CONTRADICT YOUR 
PRIOR TESTIMONY. 
>> HOLD THAT. 
>> IT IS TOO CLEAR FROM PUBLIC 
EMAILS -- YOU HAD REASON TO 
BELIEVE THOSE MATERIALS WERE 
OBTAINED INAPPROPRIATELY AT THE 
TIME. 
MR. CHAIRMAN, THERE ARE AT 
LEAST SIX DOCUMENTS THAT YOU 
CONSIDER CONFIDENTIAL BETTER 
DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS. 
JUST LIKE THE THREE DOCUMENTS 
THAT I SHARED THAT ARE ALREADY 
PUBLIC. 
THESE OTHER SIX CONTAIN NO 
PERSONAL INFORMATION, NO 
PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS, AND 
RESTRICTED MATERIAL. 
THERE IS SIMPLY NO REASON THAT 
CAN BE MADE PUBLIC. I HOPE THEY 
WILL BE BEFORE THIS NEXT ROUND. 
YOU KNOW, IT IS DIFFICULT TO 
ASK A QUESTION I HAVE TO ASK A 
REPUBLICAN TO ALLOW ME TO ASK 
THE QUESTION. 
I CERTAINLY NEVER DID THAT. 
I NEVER DID THAT WHEN I WAS 
CHAIRMAN. 
NOW, I HAD ASKED YOU IN 2006 IF 
YOU HAD SEEN ANY DOCUMENTS 
RELATED TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S WIRE
TAPPING PROGRAM OR IF YOU HAD 
HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT. 
YOU ANSWERED THAT YOU LEARNED 
ABOUT IT WITH THE REST OF US IN 
DECEMBER 2005 WHEN IT WAS 
REPORTED BY THE NEW YORK TIMES. 
I KNOW IT HAS BEEN 12 YEARS. 
SO HERE IS A VIDEO OF YOUR 
SWORN TESTIMONY. 
IT SHOULD BE ON THE TV SCREENS. 
THE DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THE 
PRESIDENT'S WARRANT TAPPING 
PROGRAM -- 
>> SENATOR, I LEARNED OF THAT 
PROGRAM WHEN THERE WAS A NEW 
YORK TIMES STORY THAT CAME OVER 
THE WIRE, I THINK IT WAS A 
THURSDAY NIGHT IN DECEMBER OF 
LAST YEAR. 
THE YOU HAD NOT SEEN ANYTHING? 
HAD YOU HEARD ANYTHING PRIOR TO 
THE ARTICLE? 
>> NO. 
>> NOTHING AT ALL? 
>> NOTHING AT ALL. 
>> AS FAR AS I KNOW, IN 15 
HEARINGS -- I'M GOING TO READ 
SOMETHING BUT PREFACE IT WITH 
THIS. 
AS FAR AS I KNOW IN THE 15 
HEARINGS I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN, 
THERE HAS NEVER BEEN SUCH A 
VIDEO SHOWN. 
SO SINCE THIS IS PRESIDENTIAL I 
WANT TO READ THIS. 
THE USE OF A VIDEO EDIT 
CONFIRMATION IS HIGHLY 
IRREGULAR BUT I SEE NO REASON 
WHY MY COLLEAGUES CAN'T USE A 
VIDEO THAT WAS PROVIDED BY THE 
NOMINEE HIMSELF IN RESPONSE TO 
THE SENATE QUESTIONNAIRE. 
I HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT THE 
VIDEO IS FROM JUDGE KAVANAUGH'S 
SUMMATION. PASTE IN THIS, WE 
HAVE ALLOWED THIS VIDEO TO BE 
SHOWN. 
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT I 
EXPECT THAT VIDEO TO BE USED 
FAIRLY. 
THE CLIPS SHOULD NOT BE 
PRESENTED IN A WAY THAT DEPRIVES
RELATIVE CONTEXT. 
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH 
REQUIREMENTS IN FEDERAL COURT. 
THAT'S WHY INSIST THAT JUDGE 
KAVANAUGH  HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO REQUEST IF ANY ADDITIONAL 
VIDEO BE PLAYED IF IT PROVIDES 
APPROPRIATE CONTEXT. 
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MORE 
CONTEXT IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS 
THE QUESTION, JUDGE KAVANAUGH? 
>> I DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD THE 
QUESTION YET BUT I'LL LET YOU 
KNOW  WHEN I'VE HEARD IT. 
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS, I WILL 
REPEAT THE QUESTION AS BEFORE. 
YOU SAID YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS 
WITH THE REST OF US IN DECEMBER 
OF 2005. 
YOU SAID THAT YOU HAD NO 
KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING RELATED 
TO THIS UNTIL THE NEW YORK 
TIMES ARTICLE. NOW WE HAVE A DOG
-- A REPORT THAT ON SEPTEMBER 
17, WHICH WAS BEFORE THE -- 
SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE THE 
ARTICLE BY THE NEW YORK TIMES, 
JOHN SHOWED YOU A MEMO ON 
SURVEILLANCE THAT HELPED FORM 
THE OPINIONS. 
WHEN YOU WERE IN THE WHITE 
HOUSE, IN 2001, DID YOU EVER 
WORK WITH JOHN ON THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF A WARRANTLESS 
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. 
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. 
>> THAT IS TALKING ABOUT A LOT 
OF DIFFERENT THINGS. 
SO WHAT YOU ARE ASKING ABOUT 
RIGHT THERE, THAT WAS THE 
SPECIFIC TERRORIST SURVEILLANCE 
PROGRAM. 
>> WHICH IS A WARRANTLESS 
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM. 
>> ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS. 
AND YOU WERE ASKING ME ABOUT 
THE TSP. THAT STORY WAS BROKEN. 
THE TESTIMONY IS 100% ACCURATE. 
THAT STORE WAS BROKEN IN THE 
NEW YORK TIMES. 
I WAS NOT READ INTO THAT 
PROGRAM. 
I ACTUALLY STILL REMEMBER MY 
EXACT REACTION WHEN I READ THAT 
STORY. 
AND THEN THE PRESIDENT DID A 
LIVE RADIO ADDRESS TO EXPLAIN 
TO THE COUNTRY WHAT THAT 
PROGRAM WAS ABOUT. 
THERE WAS A HUGE CONTROVERSY 
AND SO EVERYONE WAS THEN 
WORKING ON GETTING A SPEECH 
TOGETHER. 
YOU ASKED IF I HAD LEARNED 
ABOUT IT BEFORE THEN. 
AND I SAID NO AND THAT IS 
ACCURATE. 
>> OKAY, WHEN YOU WERE IN THE 
WHITE HOUSE DID YOU EVER WORK 
WITH JOHN ON THE IMPLICATIONS 
OF ANY WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE 
PROGRAM? 
>> I CAN'T RULE THAT DASHED IN 
THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11, IT 
WAS ALL HANDS ON DECK AND WE 
WERE FARMING OUT ASSIGNMENTS. 
BUT WE WERE ALL INVOLVED. ON 
SEPTEMBER 12 -- LET'S BACK UP, 
ON SEPTEMBER 12 WOMAN CAME INTO 
THE WHITE HOUSE, -- WHEN WE 
CAME INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, IT 
WAS WE HAVE TO WORK ON 
EVERYTHING. 
OVER TIME, PEOPLE FIGURED OUT 
WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO WORK 
ON. 
THE AIRLINE BUILT THAT WAS UP 
YOUR WHEN PRESENT -- PRESIDENT 
BUSH SPOKE TO CONGRESS. 
THEN WE ARE IN THAT MEETING 
ROOM TOGETHER WORKING ON THE 
AIRLINE BUILT BUT THERE WERE 
ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS GOING 
ON. 
THE PATRIOT ACT WAS GOING ON. 
>> I WAS INVOLVED IN ALL OF 
THOSE. 
BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, DID 
YOU EVER RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT 
WARRANTLESS SURVEILLANCE? 
>> I CAN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT. 
THERE WAS SO MUCH GOING ON IN 
THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER 11th, 
SENATOR. 
IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 
PARTICULAR, AND IN THE COUNSEL 
OFFICE. 
WE HAD EIGHT LAWYERS, EIGHT OR 
NINE AS I RECALL. 
AND THERE WERE SO MANY ISSUES 
TO CONSIDER FOR THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE LEGAL TEAM. 
AND LIKE I SAID, FOR PRESIDENT 
BUSH,  EVERYDAY WAS SEPTEMBER 
12. 
FOR THE LEGAL TEAM -- 
>> FOR A LOT OF US IT WAS. 
>> YES. 
>> ON AUGUST 16 OF THIS YEAR, 
ASKING OR MAKING DOCUMENTS 
RELATED TO THIS ISSUE PUBLIC -- 
WITHOUT THEM BEING PUBLIC, IT 
IS NOT FAIR TO ME AND NOT FAIR 
TO JUDGE KAVANAUGH THAT I 
CANNOT HAND HIM  THE ACTUAL 
DOCUMENTS WHICH I THINK WOULD 
REFRESH HIS MEMORY AND I WOULD 
ASK, AGAIN, TO LOOK AT THAT 
BEFORE MY NEXT TERM. 
CAN WE MAKE THOSE PUBLIC? 
>> YOU TELL US WHAT DOCUMENTS 
YOU WANT AND I WILL MAKE THEM 
AVAILABLE TO YOU BUT I CAN'T 
SAY THAT THEY CAN BE MADE 
PUBLIC. 
JUST AS I SAID LAST YEAR DURING 
JUDGE GORSUCH'S CONFIRMATION. 
ALL I ASKED WAS MY COLLEAGUES 
TO IDENTIFY THE DOCUMENTS THEY 
INTENDED TO USE AND I WOULD 
WORK TO GET THE DEPARTMENT OF 
JUSTICE AND FORMER PRESIDENT 
BUSH  TO AGREE TO WAIVE HER 
RESTRICTIONS. 
SENATOR FEINSTEIN SECURED THE 
PUBLIC  RELEASE OF 19 DOCUMENTS 
LAST YEAR UNDER THIS PROCESS. 
AND SENATOR KLOBUCHAR SECURED  
THE RELEASE OF FOUR DOCUMENTS 
THIS YEAR. 
IF OTHER DOCUMENTS SHOULD HAVE 
BEEN MADE PUBLIC, THEY NEVER 
TOLD ME ABOUT THEM. 
SO LET US KNOW. 
LET US KNOW WHAT YOU WANT AND 
THEN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND WE'LL 
GET THEM FOR YOU. 
>> I WANT THE SAME THING AND 
REQUESTED IN AUGUST. 
IT IS DIRECTLY REALLY VALID -- 
RELEVANT TO HIS TESTIMONY. 
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO THE 
QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN ASKING 
HERE. 
DIRECTLY RELEVANT TO HIS OWN 
EMAILS WITH JOHN. 
BEFORE MY NEXT TURN WE COULD 
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. 
>> OKAY. 
>> NOW MAY -- YOU SAID 
EVERYBODY AGREES BECAUSE -- 
EVERY VIOLATOR OF EVERY FEDERAL 
LAW, COULD A PRESIDENT ISSUE A 
PARDON IN EXCHANGE FOR A BRIBE? 
YES OR NO? 
>> SENATOR, I THINK THAT 
QUESTION HAS BEEN LITIGATED 
BEFORE AND I DON'T WANT TO 
COMMENT ABOUT -- 
>> LET ME ASK YOU THIS. 
>> PARDON. 
THERE ARE COUPLE OF THINGS 
INVOLVED IN THAT QUESTIONS -- 
QUESTION WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF 
THE PARDON? 
CAN YOU BE SEPARATELY CHARGED 
WITH THE BRIBERY CRIME? THOSE 
ARE TWO DISTINCT QUESTIONS. 
YOU WANT TO KEEP THEM SEPARATE 
IN THINKING ABOUT HOW THE 
HYPOTHETICAL -- 
>> IN THAT, -- CHAIRMAN, I HAVE 
TO INTERRUPT. 
I JUST WANT TO FINISH THIS. 
>> BUT I MADE SURE IF THE TIMER 
DIDN'T -- GIVE HIM ONE MORE 
MINUTE. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> GOD BLESS YOU. 
 PRESIDENT TRUMP 
CLAIMS HE HAS A RIGHT TO PARDON 
HIMSELF. 
DOES HE? 
>> THE QUESTION OF SELF PARDONS 
IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER 
ANALYZED. 
IT IS A QUESTION THAT I HAVE 
NOT WRITTEN ABOUT. 
IT'S A QUESTION THAT IS 
HYPOTHETICAL. 
I CAN'T BEGIN TO ANSWER IN THE 
BEST CONTEXT. 
AND THE OTHER HALF IS THE 
OBVIOUS ONE. 
DOES THE PRESIDENT HAVE THE 
ABILITY TO PARDON SOMEBODY IN 
EXCHANGE FOR A PROMISE FROM 
THAT PERSON THAT THEY WOULDN'T 
TESTIFY AGAINST HIM? 
>> SENATOR, I'M NOT GOING TO 
ANSWER HYPOTHETICAL QUESTIONS 
OF THAT SORT. 
AND THERE IS A GOOD REASON FOR 
IT. 
WHEN JUDGES DON'T -- WHEN WE 
DECIDE, WE GET BRIEFS AND 
ARGUMENTS FROM THE PARTIES. 
WE HAVE A RECORD. 
WE HAVE AN APPENDIX WITH THE 
INFORMATION. 
WE HAVE BRIEFS. 
I NEVER DECIDE ANYTHING ALONE. 
I'M IN A PANEL OF THREE. 
AND IF I AM CONFIRMED, I WOULD 
BE ON A TEAM OF NINE. 
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. 
I HOPE THAT REMAINS A 
HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. 
SINCE I'M GOING TO -- 
>> I'M DONE. 
>> SENATOR GRAHAM. 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. 
JULY 21, 1993. 
>> YES. 
>> I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT YOU 
TO LAY OUT A TEST HERE IN THE 
ABSTRACT WHICH MIGHT DETERMINE 
WHAT YOUR VOTE OR YOUR TEST TO 
BE IN A CASE YOU HAVE YET TO 
SEE THAT MAY COME BEFORE THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
THAT WAS WISE COUNSEL IN THE 
CONFIRMATION. 
VERY DIRECTLY, DID YOU EVER 
KNOWINGLY PARTICIPATE IN 
STEALING ANYTHING FROM SENATOR 
LEAHY OR ANY OTHER SENATOR? 
>> NO.  
>> DID YOU EVER KNOW THAT YOU 
WERE DEALING WITH ANYTHING THAT 
WAS STOLEN PROPERTY? 
>> NO. 
>> AS TO THE TERRORIST 
SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM, DID YOU 
HELP CREATE THIS PROGRAM? 
>> NO. 
DID YOU GIVE LEGAL ADVICE ABOUT 
IT? 
>> NO. 
>> THANK YOU. 
>> WE ARE REFERRING TO THE SAME 
PROGRAM? 
>> YES. 
ONE THE ARTICLE WAS ABOUT. 
AND SO A BIT OF A RUN THROUGH 
HERE. 
YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET 55 
VOTES. 
I DON'T KNOW, 54 OR 56 OR 57. 
THERE ARE 11 UNDECIDED SENATORS 
BEFORE THE HEARING. 
THREE OF THEM ARE REPUBLICANS. 
I LIKE YOUR CHANCES. 
EIGHT ARE DEMOCRAT. I JUST WANT 
YOU AND YOUR FAMILY TO KNOW 
THAT IN OTHER TIMES SOMEONE 
LIKE YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET 90 
VOTES. I WANT YOUR DAUGHTERS TO 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY IS 
UNIQUE TO THE TIMES THAT WE 
LIVE IN. 
AND I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE 
TO SAY SOME THINGS TO THE 
PEOPLE THAT OF ATTENDED THIS 
HEARING. 
THERE IS A FATHER OF A PARKLAND 
STUDENT WHO WAS KILLED, I THINK 
THERE IS A MOTHER OF A CHILD 
WHO HAS TERRIBLE HEALTHCARE 
PROBLEMS, AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE 
HERE WITH PERSONAL SITUATIONS. 
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO 
THEM, IF ANYTHING, ABOUT YOUR 
JOB AS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE? 
>> SENATOR, I UNDERSTAND THE 
REAL WORLD EFFECTS OF OUR 
DECISIONS. 
IN MY JOB AS A JUDGE FOR THE 
LAST 12 YEARS, I HAVE GONE OUT 
OF MY WAY IN MY OPINIONS AND AT 
ORAL ARGUMENTS TO MAKE CLEAR TO 
EVERYONE BEFORE ME THAT I 
UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION, THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FACTS. FOR 
EXAMPLE AS I WAS STAYING -- 
SAYING TO SENATOR FEINSTEIN  
EARLIER, AND I WANT TO REASSURE 
EVERYONE THAT I BASE MY 
DECISIONS ON THE LAW. 
BUT I DO SO WITH AN AWARENESS 
OF THE FACTS AND AN AWARENESS 
OF THE REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES 
AND HAVE NOT LIVED IN A BUBBLE. 
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW 
PASSIONATELY PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT 
PARTICULAR ISSUES. 
AND I UNDERSTAND HOW PERSONALLY 
PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED BY ISSUES. 
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 
DIFFICULTIES THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
IN AMERICA. 
I UNDERSTAND, FOR EXAMPLE, -- 
TO START, I UNDERSTAND THE 
SITUATION OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. 
I SEE THEM ON A REGULAR BASHAN 
WHEN I AM SERVING MEALS. 
HE TELL ME ABOUT THAT. 
WHAT INDIRECTION YOU HAVE WITH 
HOMELESS PEOPLE? 
>> SENATOR, I REGULARLY SERVE 
MEALS WITH FATHER JOHN WHO IS 
THE HEAD OF CATHOLIC CHARITIES 
D.C. I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE I WAS 
9 YEARS OLD. 
I WAS AN ALTAR BOY. 
AND WHAT YOU LEARN WHEN -- I 
TRY TO FOLLOW THE LESSON OF 
SERVING THE LEASE FORTUNATE 
AMONG US. 
I WAS HUNGRY, YOU GAVE ME FOOD. 
STRANGER, YOU WELCOME ME. 
SICK, AND YOU CARED FOR ME. 
SIX GROUPS THAT -- IS NOT 
EXCLUSIVE BUT THAT IS A GREAT 
PLACE TO START WITH YOUR 
PRIVATE TIME. 
>> DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN BRETT KAVANAUGH THE MAN 
AND  BRETT KAVANAUGH THE JUDGE. 
>> AS A MAN, I'M TRYING TO DO 
WHAT I CAN AND COMMUNITY 
SERVICE AS A DAD, A COACH, A 
HUSBAND, A VOLUNTEER. THE ONE 
THING YOU KNOW, WE ARE ALL GOD'S
CHILDREN. 
PEOPLE OF GOTTEN THERE BECAUSE 
MAYBE THEY HAVE A MENTAL 
ILLNESS, MAYBE THEY HAD A 
TERRIBLE FAMILY SITUATION, 
MAYBE THEY LOST A JOB AND HAD 
NO FAMILY. 
BUT EVERY PERSON YOU SERVE A 
MEAL TO IS JUST AS GOOD AS ME 
OR BETTER, FRANKLY, BECAUSE 
THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH THINGS 
JUST TO GET A MEAL ON A DAILY 
BASIS. 
AND YOU TALK TO THEM. 
THAT'S THE OTHER THING. 
WHEN YOU'RE WALKING BY THE 
STREET, YOU SEE PEOPLE -- AND I 
UNDERSTAND. 
I'M SURE I'VE DONE THIS. 
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND BETTER 
THAN SOMEONE DESCRIBING THIS 
BUT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY LOOK 
AND YOU DON'T SAY, HOW IS IT 
GOING. 
BUT WHEN YOU SERVE MEALS TO 
THEM, YOU TALK TO PEOPLE THAT 
ARE HOMELESS. 
AND THEY ARE JUST AS HUMAN AND 
JUST AS GOOD OF PEOPLE AS ALL 
OF US. WE ARE ALL PART OF ONE 
COMMUNITY. 
AND SO, I THINK ABOUT THAT. 
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE -- I 
CAN ALWAYS DO MORE AND MORE AND 
DO BETTER. 
I FALL SHORT. 
FATHER JOHN HAS BEEN A BIG 
INFLUENCE. 
THAT'S AS A PERSON. 
I TRY TO DO THAT. 
THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
SITUATION. 
THOSE ARE LOW INCOME BOYS FROM 
LOW INCOME FAMILIES. 
IT IS A TUITION FREE SCHOOL. 
I STARTED TUTORING UP THERE 
BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO SOME 
MORE TUTORING. 
AND JUST BE INVOLVED MORE. 
JUDGING IS IMPORTANT BUT I WANT 
TO BE MORE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN 
THE COMMUNITY. 
THEY HAD TUTORING. 
YOU DO HOMEWORK. 
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO HOME AND 
HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO DO. 
YOU HAVE THREE MEALS A DO YOUR 
HOMEWORK. 
AND YOU SEE THESE GREAT KIDS 
AND THEY ARE IN A STRUCTURED 
ENVIRONMENT. 
AND JAMAICAN EFFECT ON THEIR 
LIVES. 
AND LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY -- 
AND YOU MAKE AN EFFECT ON THEIR 
LIVES. 
AND LIKE I SAID YESTERDAY, FOR 
ME TO PARTICIPATE YOU CAN'T 
CHANGE EVERYTHING AT ONCE. 
BUT JUST CHANGING ONE LIFE, ONE 
MEAL, ONE DAY AT THE SHELTER 
AND ONE KID THAT REMEMBER 
SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID IN A 
TUTORING PROGRAM. 
IF WE ALL DID THAT MORE, AND I 
FALL SHORT TOO, AND I WANT TO 
DO MORE ON THAT FRONT, BUT YOU 
CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN 
PEOPLE'S LIVES. 
JUDGING IS BASED ON THE LAW BUT 
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT ME AS A 
JUDGE? 
FIRST OF ALL, JUST STANDING IN 
THE SHOES OF OTHERS. 
WE CAN ALL BE THAT HOMELESS 
PERSON. 
WE CAN BE THAT KID WHO NEEDS 
MORE STRUCTURED EDUCATIONAL 
ENVIRONMENTS. 
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS TAUGHT 
BY MY MOM AND I REMEMBER MY SIX 
GRADE ENGLISH TEACHER IN 
RELIGION TEACHER AND COACH, ONE 
OF HIS -- AND HE DROVE ME TO 
SCHOOL. 
AND HE IS NOW ON THE BOARD OF 
THE ACADEMY WITH ME. 
BUT ONE OF HIS LESSONS WAS TO 
STAND IN THE SHOES OF OTHERS. 
AND I STILL HAVE THE TO KILL A 
MOCKINGBIRD THAT WE USED IN 
SIXTH GRADE. 
>> IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOUR 
JOB IS A JUDGE IS TO NOT SO 
MUCH STAND IN THE SHOES OF 
SOMEBODY YOU'RE SYMPATHETIC TO 
BUT STAND IN THE SHOES OF THE 
LAW? 
>> YOU ARE IN THE SHOES OF THE 
LAW BUT WITH AWARENESS OF 
DECISIONS. 
THAT'S THE CRITICAL 
DISTINCTION. 
YOU CAN'T BE UNAWARE WHEN YOU 
WRITE AN OPINION. 
HOW IS IT GOING TO AFFECT PEOPLE
X AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND 
EXPLAIN -- IS EXPLAINING. AND 
THEN WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THE 
COURTROOM AND HOW YOU TREAT 
LITIGANTS. 
WE HAVE ALL BEEN IN COURTROOMS 
WHERE THE JUDGE IS ACTING A 
LITTLE TOO FULL OF BEING A 
JUDGE. 
AND TO -- WELL, WE HAVE ALL 
BEEN THERE. 
I TRY NOT TO DO THAT. 
I CAN'T SAY IMPERFECT BUT I TRY 
TO MAKE SURE THEY KNOW I GET 
IT. 
IF IT IS THE CRIMINAL DEFENDANT 
CASE, WE HAD A PRO SE CASE. 
A CASE WHERE THE LITIGANT COMES 
AND ARGUES IN OUR COURT WHICH 
REALLY HAPPENS. 
HAD IT WAS A GUY WHO SAID HE 
HAD BEEN CALLED THE LETTER AND 
WORD -- N WORD BY A SUPERVISOR. 
AND I WROTE A SEPARATE OPINION 
EXPLAINING YES, THE SINGLE 
INSTANCE DOES CONSTITUTE A 
RACIALLY HOSTILE WORK 
ENVIRONMENT. 
AND I EXPLAINED IN DOING THAT 
THE HISTORY OF RACISM IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND HOW THAT WORD -- NO 
OTHER WORD SO POWERFULLY CALLS 
TO MIND THE LONG AND BRUTAL 
STRUGGLE AGAINST RACISM. 
I WRITE -- BUT I WANTED TO MAKE 
CLEAR BY BRING THIS EXAMPLE OF 
THIS I UNDERSTOOD HIS 
SITUATION. 
I TRIED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT 
WOULD BE LIKE. 
I DECIDED THE CASE BASED ON THE 
LAW BUT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE 
POINT WAS. 
I WAS TRY TO BE AWARE OF THE 
FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. 
>> DID YOU EVER MAKE IT LEGAL 
DECISION THAT WAS PERSONALLY 
UPSETTING TO YOU? 
>> I'M SURE I HAVE. 
THAT'S WHAT JUSTICE KENNEDY 
TALKED ABOUT IN TEXAS VERSUS 
JOHNSON. 
THAT'S THE FLAGBURNING CASE. 
AND JUSTICE KENNEDY IS IN THE 
MINORITY. 
AND IT SAYS THAT A LAW AGAINST 
FLAGBURNING IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT. 
THAT TOUR JUSTICE KENNEDY -- IT 
REALLY BOTHERED HIM. 
HE STILL RULED THE WAY HE DID 
BECAUSE HE READ THE FIRST 
AMENDMENT TO COMPEL THAT RESULT.
AND THAT CONCURRENCE IS SUCH A 
GREAT MODEL FOR JUDGING, AND A 
GREAT MODEL OF INDEPENDENCE AND 
A GREAT POINT TO WE FOLLOW THE 
LAW BUT WE ARE AWARE. 
WE ARE AWARE. 
AND YOU'RE BETTER JUDGE IF YOU 
ARE WHERE. 
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY THIS, 
EVERYTHING HE SAID I THINK HAS 
BEEN VERIFIED BY THE PEOPLE WHO 
KNOW HIM THE BEST. 
I CAN'T SAY I'VE READ 307 OF 
YOUR OPINIONS. 
I CAN TELL YOU, I HAVE NOT. 
I DID NOT READ SOME OF THESE 
BUT WHAT I CHOSE TO DO IS LOOK 
AT THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW HIM THE 
BEST. 
AND I THINK BOB BENNETT WHO 
DEFENDED PRESIDENT CLINTON SAID 
THAT HE IS A JUDGES JUDGE. 
SOMEBODY DOING HIS BEST TO 
FOLLOW HIS LOT RATHER THAN HIS 
PREFERENCES. 
HE IS AN ALL-STAR IN HIS 
PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL LIFE. 
I'VE YET TO FIND ANYBODY THAT I 
FIND CREDIBLE, REALLY ANYBODY 
AT ALL THAT WAS ADJUST TO THE 
FACT THAT YOU ARE UNFAIR TO 
LITIGANTS. 
BUT YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN. 
IS THAT TRUE? 
>> I REGISTER -- 
>> WAS, OKAY. 
>> YES. 
>> I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY 
THAT. 
IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. 
GIVEN WE WORK FOR. 
>> I WILL LET YOU FINISH YOUR 
QUESTION. 
YOU WORK FOR A LOT OF 
REPUBLICANS. 
>> YES. 
>> PRESIDENT BUSH, I WORKED 
FOR. 
YES. 
>> THAT IS ALL FINE. 
>> SO, I REMEMBER -- [ CROWD 
CHANTING ] SO I ASKED ABOUT A 
STATEMENT THAT GREG CRAIG MADE. 
DO YOU KNOW HIM BY ANY CHANCE? 
>> I HAVE MET HIM. 
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN MANY 
YEARS. 
>> HE WAS THE DEFENDER OF 
PRESIDENT CLINTON DURING THE 
IMPEACHMENT HEARING AND 
SOMEWHERE IN HERE, I HAVE HIS 
STATEMENT ABOUT KAGAN. 
>> NO. 
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS STATEMENT. 
HERE WE GO. 
HERE IS WHAT -- HE WAS A 
PROGRESSIVE IN THE MOLD OF 
OBAMA HIMSELF. 
IT COMES FROM THE PROGRESSIVE 
SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM ACCORDING 
TO RONALD KLEIN, THE FIRST WAS 
GREG CRICK. I HAD AN EXCHANGE 
WITH THE JUSTICE WHEN SHE WAS 
THE NOMINEE. 
I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU. HE 
SAID YOU ARE LARGELY 
PROGRESSIVE. 
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. 
SENATOR GRAHAM, YOU KNOW I HAVE 
BEEN A DEMOCRAT ALL MY LIFE. 
I WORK FOR 2 DEMOCRATIC 
PRESIDENTS. 
THAT'S WHAT MY POLITICAL VIEWS 
ARE. 
WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOUR 
POLITICAL VIEWS PROGRESSIVE? 
MISS KAGAN, MY VIEWS ARE 
GENERALLY  PROGRESSIVE. WHICH 
IS TRUE. 
I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT SHE 
SAID BECAUSE I EXPECT PRESIDENT 
OBAMA TO GO TO SOMEONE LIKE 
KAGAN WHO IS PROGRESSIVE AND 
SHARES HIS GENERAL  VIEW OF 
JUDGING, AND HAVE -- HAPPENED 
TO BE HIGHLY QUALIFIED. 
HE WANTED SOMEONE WHOSE 
PHILOSOPHY OF JUDGING WAS HIS. 
WHICH IS APPLIED TO THE LAW AND 
CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES. 
>>I EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN. 
TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER 
SIDE, WHAT DO YOU REALLY EXPECT?
YOU SHOULD CELEBRATE EVEN 
THOUGH YOU DON'T VOTE FOR HIM 
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU 
WOULDN'T, THE QUALITY OF THE 
MAN CHOSEN BY PRESIDENT OBAMA. 
KAGAN AND SOTOMAYOR  CAME FROM 
THE PROGRESSIVE WING OF THE 
JUDGING WORLD AND OF LEGAL 
THOUGHT. 
THEY ARE HOLY -- HIGHLY 
QUALIFIED PEOPLE. 
LET'S SEE IF I CAN GET THE VOTE 
TOTALS. 
KAGAN GOT 63 VOTES AND  
STOUDEMIRE GOT 68. 
IT'S GOING TO BOTHER ME THAT 
YOU DON'T GET THOSE NUMBERS. 
WHAT BOTHERS ME IS THEY 
SHOULD'VE GOTTEN 90. THEY 
SHOULD'VE GOTTEN 95. 
ANTHONY KENNEDY GOT 97. 
ANTHONY SCALIA GOT 98. 
RUTH BADER GINSBURG GOT 96. 
SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED? 
BETWEEN THEN AND NOW, ADVISING 
CONSENT HAS TAKEN ON A 
DIFFERENT MEANING. 
IT USED TO BE THE UNDERSTANDING 
OF THIS BODY THAT ELECTIONS 
HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND YOU WOULD 
EXPECT THE PRESIDENT WHO WON 
THE ELECTION TO SELECT SOMEBODY 
OF THEIR PHILOSOPHY. 
I PROMISE YOU WHEN HE VOTED, HE 
DID NOT AGREE WITH HER LEGAL 
PHILOSOPHY. 
AND I DOUBT IF SENATOR LEE 
AGREED WITH JUSTICE SCALIA. 
SENATOR LEE HAS VOTED FOR A LOT 
OF REPUBLICANS. 
I HAVE VOTED FOR EVERYONE 
PRESENTED SINCE I HAVE BEEN HERE
BECAUSE I FIND THEM TO BE 
HIGHLY QUALIFIED, COMING FROM 
BACKGROUNDS I WOULD EXPECT THE 
PRESIDENT IN QUESTION TO CHOOSE 
FROM. 
SO AS TO YOUR QUALIFICATIONS, 
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A JUDGE? 
>> I HAVE BEEN A JUDGE FOR 12 
YEARS. 
>> HOW MANY OPINIONS HAVE YOU 
WRITTEN? 
>> I HAVE WRITTEN OVER 300 
OPINIONS. 
>> OKAY. 
DO YOU THINK THERE IS A LOT WE 
CAN LEARN FROM THOSE OPINIONS 
IF WE LOOK AT THEM? 
>> YES. 
I'M VERY PROUD OF MY OPINIONS. 
AS I MENTIONED, I TELL PEOPLE 
DON'T JUST READ ABOUT THE 
OPINIONS, READ THE OPINIONS. 
I'M PROUD OF THEM. 
>> YOU WERE NOMINATED BY 
PRESIDENT TRUMP ON JULY 9. MY 
BIRTHDAY. 
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GOOD 
BIRTHDAY PRESENT AT -- AND I 
MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH 
IT. 
BY 9:23, CHUCK SCHUMER SAYS I 
WILL OPPOSE JUDGE KAVANAUGH.  
BY 9:25, JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL THREAT 
OF AMERICANS. 
I WILL OPPOSE THE NOMINATION. 
ELIZABETH WORN AT 9:55, HIS 
RECORD IS CLEAR AND HOSTILE TO 
HEALTHCARE. 
HE THINKS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS 
ABOVE THE LAW. 
ON AND ON AND ON. 
BERNIE SANDERS AT 10:18. 
IF BRETT KAVANAUGH IS 
CONFIRMED,  IT WILL HAVE 
PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON 
RIGHTS. 
ALL I CAN SAY WITHIN AN HOUR 
AND 18 MINUTES OF YOUR 
NOMINATION, YOU BECAME THE 
BIGGEST THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. 
IN THE EYES OF SOME OF THE MOST 
PARTISAN PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, 
WHO WOULD HOLD KAGAN AND 
STOUDEMIRE UP AS HIGHLY 
QUALIFIED AND WOULD CHALLENGE 
ANY WHO VOTE AGAINST THEM. 
YOU LIVE IN UNUSUAL TIMES. 
YOU SHOULD GET MORE THAN 90 
VOTES BUT YOU WON'T. 
AND I'M SORRY IT HAS GOTTEN TO 
WHERE IT HAS. 
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO ABOUT YOU. 
IF YOU DON'T MIND, WHAT DID YOU 
TELL YOUR CHILDREN YESTERDAY? 
ABOUT THE HEARING? 
>> I WILL TELL THEM WHAT THEY 
TOLD ME. 
THEY GAVE ME A BIG HUG AND SAID 
GOOD JOB, DADDY. 
MARGARET BEFORE SHE WENT TO BED 
MADE A SPECIAL TRIP DOWN AND 
GAVE ME A SPECIAL HUG. 
I JUST WISH IF WE COULD HAVE A 
HEARING WHERE THE NOMINEES KIDS 
CAN SHOW UP. 
IS THAT ASKING TOO MUCH? 
SO WHAT KIND OF COUNTRY HAVE WE 
BECOME? NONE OF THIS HAPPENED 
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. 
IT IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE 
AND WORSE. 
AND ALL OF US HAVE AN 
OBLIGATION TO TRY TO CORRECT IT.
ROE V. WADE,  ARE YOU FAMILIAR 
WITH THE CASE? 
>> I AM, SENATOR. 
 
>> CAN YOU AND 30 SECONDS GAVE 
ME THE GENERAL HOLDING OF ROE 
V. WADE? 
>>  AS ELABORATED UPON, A WOMAN 
HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AS 
INTERPRETED BY THE COURT IN THE 
CONSTITUTION TO OBTAIN AN 
ABORTION UP TO THE POINT OF 
VIABILITY, SUBJECT TO REASONABLE
REGULATIONS BY THE STATE AS 
SOON AS THOSE REGULATIONS DO 
NOT CONSTITUTE AN UNDUE BURDEN 
ON THE WOMAN'S RIGHT. 
>> AS TO HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS, 
CAN YOU SIT DOWN WITH FOUR OTHER
JUDGES AND OVERRULE ROE V. WADE 
JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT TO. 
>> ROE V. WADE IS AN IMPORTANT  
PRECEDENT. 
>> YOU JUST CAN'T -- WHAT ARE 
YOU DOING FOR LUNCH? 
LET'S OVERRULE ROE V. WADE. 
IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.  
I SEE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING, 
SENATOR. 
THE WAY CASES COME UP TO US IN 
THAT CONTEXT OR OTHERS WOULD BE 
-- 
>> TONIGHT BE -- CAN I GIVE AN 
EXAMPLE? 
>> YES. 
SOME STATES SUMMER PASSES A LAW 
THAT RUNS INTO THE FACE AND 
SOMEBODY WILL OBJECT AND GO TO 
THE LOWER COURTS AND EVENTUALLY 
MIGHT COME TO THE SUPREME COURT 
CHALLENGING THE FOUNDATIONS OF 
ROE V. WADE. 
IT WOULD TAKE A LEGISLATION OF  
ENACTMENT FOR THAT TO HAPPEN? 
>> THAT'S CORRECT. 
IF THERE WAS SUCH AN ACTION 
CHALLENGING ROE V. WADE  AND IT 
CAME BEFORE THE COURT, WOULD 
YOU LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES? 
>> I LISTEN TO BOTH SIDES IN 
EVERY CASE, SENATOR. 
I HAVE FOR 12 YEARS. 
YES. 
>> WHEN IT COMES TO OVERRULING, 
ANALYSIS? 
>> SO, FIRST OF ALL, YOU START 
WITH THE NOTION OF PRECEDENT. 
AND IF I SAID TO SENATOR 
FEINSTEIN,  THIS IS BEEN 
REAFFIRMED MANY TIMES OVER 45 
YEARS INCLUDED IN PLANNED 
PARENTHOOD VERSUS CASEY.  
THAT IMPORTANTLY BECAME 
PRESIDENT ON PRECEDENT -- 
PRECEDENT ON PRECEDENT. 
THERE ARE FACTORS YOU LOOK AT 
WHEN YOU'RE CONSIDERING ANY 
PRECEDENT. 
>> SO THERE IS A PROFIT -- 
PROCESS IN PLACE? 
IS THAT CORRECT? 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> IF SOMEBODY SAID CITIZENS 
UNITED HAS BEEN HARMFUL TO THE 
COUNTRY, AND MADE A RECORD THAT 
THE EFFECTS OF CITIZENS UNITED 
HAS EMPOWERED ABOUT 20 OR 30 
PEOPLE TO RUN ALL THE ELECTIONS 
IN SOME STATE OR LOCALITY 
SOMEWHERE AND PASSED A BEEN ON 
SOFT MONEY, AND IT GOT TO THE 
COURT, WOULD YOU AT LEAST 
LISTEN TO THE ARGUMENT THAT 
THEY NEED TO BE REVISITED? 
>> OF COURSE. 
I LISTEN TO ALL ARGUMENTS. 
YOU HAVE AN OPEN MIND. 
YOU GET THE BRIEFS AND 
ARGUMENTS. 
SOME ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS. 
PRECEDENT IS CRITICALLY 
IMPORTANT. BUT YOU LISTEN TO 
ALL ARGUMENTS. 
>> OKAY. 
WHERE WERE YOU ON SEPTEMBER 11, 
2001? 
>> I WAS IN MY DEN OFFICE 
INITIALLY. 
AND THEN AFTER THE FIRST CALL, 
I WAS IN THE COUNCILS OFFICE 
FOR THE NEXT FEW MINUTES. 
THEN WE WERE ALL TOLD TO GO 
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WEST 
WING. 
AND THEN WE WERE ALL EVACUATED. 
I THINK THAT THOUGHT WAS FLIGHT 
93 MIGHT'VE BEEN HEADED FOR THE 
WHITE HOUSE AND HEADED HERE. 
AND SECRET SERVICE WAS HUSTLING 
US OUT. 
AND THEN PANIC. THEY STARTED 
SCREAMING AT US. 
SPRINT, RON! 
-- RUN! 
MY WIFE WAS A FEW STEPS AHEAD 
OF ME. 
WE SPRINTED OUT. 
SHE WAS WEARING A BLACK AND 
WHITE SHIRT. 
AND I REMEMBER WE SPRINTED OUT 
THE FRONT GATE INTO LAFAYETTE 
PARK KIND OF. 
NO IPHONES OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT. 
THE CELL PHONES DIDN'T WORK. 
WE WERE JUST ALL KIND OF OUT 
THERE. 
I REMEMBER SOMEHOW, ENDING UP 
SEEING ON TV ON CONNECTICUT 
AVENUE THERE WERE TVS OUT, I 
REMEMBER I WAS WITH SARAH 
TAYLOR WHO WORKED AT THE WHITE 
HOUSE. 
AND WE WATCHED -- WE WERE 
WATCHING WHEN THE TWO BUILDINGS 
FELL. 
>> WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS POST-9/11,
THAT WE HAVE BEEN AT WAR AND IT 
IS CALLED THE WAR ON TERRORISM, 
DO YOU GENERALLY AGREE WITH 
THAT CONCEPT? 
>> I DO, SENATOR. 
THAT WAS PASSED ON SEPTEMBER 14.
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE LAW AND 
WAR. 
IS THERE A BODY OF LAW CALLED 
THE LAW OF ARMS CONFLICT? 
>> THERE IS. 
THE IS THERE ONE CALLED BASIC 
CRIMINAL LAW? 
>> YES. 
>> ARE THERE DIFFERENCES? 
>> YES, SENATOR. 
>> FROM A CITIZEN'S POINT OF 
VIEW DO YOUR RIGHTS FOLLOW YOU? 
IF YOU'RE IN PARIS, DOES THE 
FOURTH AMENDMENT DETECT YOU AS 
AN AMERICAN FROM YOUR OWN 
GOVERNMENT? 
>> FROM YOUR OWN GOVERNMENT, 
YES. 
>> OKAY. 
IF YOU ARE IN AFGHANISTAN, DO 
YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS 
PROTECT YOU AGAINST YOUR OWN 
GOVERNMENT? 
>> IF YOU'RE AN AMERICAN IN 
AFGHANISTAN, YOU HAVE 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AS 
AGAINSTTHE U.S. GOVERNMENT. 
THAT'S LONG SETTLED. 
>> ISN'T THERE ALSO A LONG 
SETTLED LAW THAT GOES BACK TO A 
CASE, I CAN'T MEMBER THE NAME. 
AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO 
COLLABORATE WITH THE ENEMY ARE 
CONSIDERED ENEMY OF COMBATANTS? 
>> THEY CAN BE. 
>> CAN BE? 
>> THEY ARE SOMETIMES CRIMINALLY
PROSECUTED AND SOMETIMES 
TREATED IN THE -- 
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT CAN BE. 
THERE IS A DECISION THAT SAID 
AMERICAN CITIZENS WHO 
COLLABORATED WITH SABOTEURS 
WERE TRIED BY THE MILITARY, IS 
THAT CORRECT? 
>> THAT IS CORRECT. 
>> I THINK A COUPLE WERE 
EXECUTED? 
>> YES. 
>> SO IF ANYBODY DOUBTS THERE 
IS A LONG-STANDING HISTORY IN 
THIS COUNTRY, THAT YOUR 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS FOLLOW 
YOU WHEREVER YOU GO BUT YOU 
DON'T HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL 
RIGHT TO TURN ON YOUR OWN 
GOVERNMENT, ELABORATE WITH THE 
ENEMY OF THE NATION. 
YOU'LL BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY. 
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE CASE, 
IF YOU CAN RECALL, THAT 
REAFFIRMED THE CONCEPT THAT YOU 
COULD HOLD ONE OF OUR OWN AS AN 
ENEMY COMBATANT IF THEY WERE 
ENGAGED IN TERRORIST 
ACTIVITIES? 
>> YES. 
>> SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS ON 
EVERY CITIZEN ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE 
RIGHTS, WE DO NOT HAVE A 
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT CAN 
ELABORATE WITH THE ENEMY. 
THERE IS A BODY OF LAW WELL 
DEVELOPED LONG BEFORE 9/11 THAT 
UNDERSTOOD THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN BASIC CRIMINAL LAW AND 
THE LAW OF ARMED CONFLICT. 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THOSE 
DIFFERENCES? 
>> I DO. 
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE 
DIFFERENT BODIES OF LAW. 
OF COURSE, SENATOR. 
>> IF YOU ARE CONFIRMED, AND I 
BELIEVE YOU WILL BE, WHAT IS 
YOUR HOPE WHEN ALL OF THIS IS 
SAID AND DONE AND YOUR TIME IS 
UP, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE 
REMEMBERED? 
>> A GOOD DAD. 
A GOOD JUDGE. 
>> GOOD HUSBAND. 
>> I THINK HE IS GETTING THERE. 
>> GOOD HUSBAND. 
 THANKS, DIANE. 
YOU HELPED HIM A LOT. 
IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER FOR YOU 
TONIGHT. 
 
>> IOU. 
AGAIN SON. 
-- A GOOD SON. 
I WILL QUICKLY ADD THAT. 
THE PILLARS OF MY LIFE FOR 
BEING A JUDGE, OF COURSE. 
BEING A TEACHER. 
I HAVE DONE THAT. 
EITHER WAY, I'M GOING TO 
CONTINUE TEACHING. 
COACHING. AS I MENTIONED, 
THAT'S A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE. 
SENATOR KENNEDY ADVISED ME WHEN 
WE MET, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP 
COACHING. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW 
THAT. 
VOLUNTEERING. 
AND BEING A DAD AND A SON AND A 
HUSBAND AND BEING A FRIEND. 
I TALKED ABOUT MY FRIENDS 
YESTERDAY. 
I DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT -- I GOT 
A LITTLE BIT CHOKED UP. 
>> THAT WAS WELL SAID. 
I JUST RAN OUT OF TIME. 
>> THANK YOU, SENATOR. 
I WILL STOP THERE. 
WE WE ARE ABOUT READY TO BREAK 
FOR LUNCH AND A VOTE THAT WE 
HAVE. 
IT WILL BE 30 MINUTES. 
FOR I DO THAT, I HAVE A LETTER 
THAT SENATOR FEINSTEIN ASKED ME 
TO PUT IN THE RECORD  -- 70 
LETTERS FROM PEOPLE IN 
OPPOSITION TO YOUR NOMINATION. 
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE LETTERS 
IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE KAVANAUGH  
FROM HUNDREDS OF MEN AND WOMEN 
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HOLDING 
DIVERSE POLITICAL VIEWS. 
THEY STRONGLY SUPPORT HIS 
CONFIRMATION. 
THOSE WILL BE ENTERED INTO THE 
RECORD ALSO. 
AND THEN I WANTED TO EXPLAIN 
THE EXCHANGE THAT I HAD WITH 
SENATOR LEAHY.  
JUST SO PEOPLE DON'T THINK THAT 
IS SOMETHING THAT I DID ON MY 
OWN. 
WE HAD PREVIOUSLY SENT OUT A 
LETTER AND ONLY SENATOR 
KLOBUCHAR UP TO THAT  POINT HAD 
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE LETTER 
TO BE ABLE TO ASK FOR DOCUMENTS 
THAT WERE COMMITTEE CONFIDENTIAL
. SO THAT THEY COULD USE THEM 
AT THE HEARING. 
AND THE ONLY THING I'VE DONE 
FOR SENATOR LEAHY  THAT WASN'T 
ALREADY IN THAT LETTER WAS TO 
REMIND PEOPLE THAT WE DID THE 
SAME THING FOR THE NEIL GORSUCH 
NOMINATION TO THE SUPREME COURT.
IT IS POLICY THAT SENATOR LEAHY 
WHEN HE WAS CHAIRMAN  FOLLOWED. 
SO THE ONLY COURTESY WAS 
EXTENDED TO SENATOR LEAHY, THE 
FACT THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE THE 
REQUEST  BY THE TIMELINE THAT 
WAS IN THE LEATHER -- LETTER. 
WE ARE GOING TO ADJOURN 30 
MINUTES FOR A LUNCH BREAK. 
AND I THINK WE'LL BE BACK 
EXACTLY IN 30 MINUTES. 
IF NOT, JUDGE KAVANAUGH  WE 
WILL BE LET YOUR STAFF KNOW IF 
IT WILL BE LATER. 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN THE SENATE WHEN YOU 
HAVE A VOTE. 
>>> THERE YOU HAVE IT. 
DAY TWO OF THE BRETT KAVANAUGH 
CONFIRMATION  HEARINGS. 
ANOTHER EXHAUSTIVE MORNING IN 
WHICH LAWMAKERS WERE GIVEN A 
HALF HOUR EACH TO QUESTION THE 
JUDGE AND ALL OF THEM TOOK FULL 
ADVANTAGE OF THAT HALF HOUR. 
HE WAS REALLY QUESTIONED ON A 
VARIETY OF THINGS, OF COURSE. 
ROE V. WADE  WAS A LENGTHY BACK-
AND-FORTH. 
SOME STOLEN EMAILS THAT 
APPARENTLY THE JUDGE HAD 
RECEIVED THAT CAME FROM LEAHY'S 
OFFICE. 
AND HE WAS QUESTIONED A FEW 
TIMES ABOUT THIS IDEA IF A 
SITTING PRESIDENT SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO BE INDICTED. 
YOU KNOW, HE WORKED WITH KEN 
STAR DURING THE IMPEACHMENT OF 
CLINTON. 
AND HE WAS ASKED -- INVOLVED 
DEEPLY IN THAT. 
AND HE WAS ASKED WHEN HIS 
OPINION ON HOW A PRESIDENT 
SHOULD BE TREATED AND IF HE 
SHOULD BE INDICTED, HE SAID IT 
WAS AFTER 9/11. 
HE SAID HOW FOCUSED PRESIDENT 
BUSH WAS AFTER HE ATTACKED THIS 
ISSUE AND THE WAR ON TERRORISM. 
HE THOUGHT, IT IS SUCH A WEIGHTY
JOB THAT YOU ADD AN 
INVESTIGATION WILL BE TOO MUCH. 
WE ALSO SAW HIM LOOKING LIKE HE 
WAS GOING TO TEAR UP. 
>> YES. 
>> LINDSEY GRAHAM STARTED 
TALKING ABOUT HIS DAUGHTERS. 
>>'S LEGACY, HIS DAUGHTERS. 
HE ALSO WAS ASKED A POINTED 
QUESTION ABOUT ROE V. WADE. 
HE SAID  LEGALIZED ABORTION IS 
AN IMPORTANT PRESIDENT OF THE 
SUPREME COURT THAT HAS BEEN 
REAFFIRMED MANY TIMES. 
TAKE A LISTEN. 
>> AS A JUDGE, IT IS AN 
IMPORTANT PRECEDENT OF THE 
SUPREME COURT. 
BY IT, I MEAN ROE V. WADE  AND 
PLANNED PARENTHOOD AGAINST 
CASEY.  
CASEY IS  PRECEDENT ON 
PRECEDENT. 
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO 
REMEMBER. 
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISSUE. 
AND I UNDERSTAND THE 
SIGNIFICANCE OF -- AS BEST I 
CAN. 
I ALWAYS TRY. 
I DO HERE EFFECTS OF THAT 
DECISION AS I TRY TO DO WITH 
ALL THE DECISIONS OF MY COURT 
AND OF THE SUPREME COURT. 
>> SO NOW WHAT IS INTERESTING 
ABOUT THE RESPONSE, AND WE 
HAVEN'T HEARD YET FROM SENATOR 
SHELDON WHO IS MANY CONSIDERED 
OF HAVING A GREAT LEGAL MIND, I 
SUSPECT THAT OTHERS WHO ARE 
INTERESTED IN GETTING HIS 
POSITION ON ROE V. WADE ARE 
GOING TO ASK HIM. 
AND SO YOU SAY, AND THIS IS A 
QUOTE,  IT IS AN IMPORTANT 
PRECEDENT THAT HAS BEEN 
REFORMED MANY TIMES. 
DO YOU THINK IT WAS DECIDED 
CORRECTLY? 
>> RIGHT. 
NOBODY IS PHRASED IT LIKE THAT 
YET. 
THE JUDGE HAS SHIED AWAY FROM 
ANY QUESTIONS THAT HE FEELS ARE 
HYPOTHETICAL SITUATIONS. 
AND THAT'S SORT OF HIS ANSWER. 
THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL. 
I'M NOT GOING TO GO ON THE 
RECORD. 
>> IT'S THE GINSBERG ROLE. 
-- RULE. 
THEY WERE ASKING HER QUESTIONS 
ABOUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS 
INCLUDING ROE V. WADE AND SHE 
SAYS SHE CAN'T ANSWER THEM  
UNTIL SHE'S ACTUALLY FACED WITH 
THE ACTUAL CASE. 
>> YES. 
YES. 
AND HE BROUGHT UP SOMETHING 
THAT HE REPEATED ONE LINDSEY 
GRAHAM TALK TO HIM. 
THEY TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN 
THE AUDIENCE THAT HAD ISSUES IN 
THEIR PERSONAL LIFE AND WORK 
INTERESTED INCLUDING AT LEAST 
ONE FATHER FROM MARJORY 
STONEMAN DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL 
WHO LOST HIS DAUGHTER. 
HE SAID I DO MAKE DECISIONS 
BASED ON THE LAW BUT I ALSO 
TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE REAL 
WORLD IMPLICATIONS OF THOSE 
LEGAL DECISIONS. 
>> VERY IMPORTANT. 
>> WHILE WE ARE FOLLOWING THIS, 
WE WERE ALSO MONITORING A 
DEVELOPING MEDICAL SITUATION

I WOULD'VE THOUGHT THAT 
LEADERSHIP AT GOOGLE WOULD HAVE 
WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW 
SERIOUSLY IT TAKES THESE 
CHALLENGES AND ACTUALLY TAKE A 
LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THIS 
IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. 
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DIDN'T 
CHOOSE TO MAKE THAT DECISION.

HERE'S WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY. 
>> AT ITS BEST, FACEBOOK PLAYS 
A POSITIVE ROLE IN OUR 
DEMOCRACY, ENABLING 
REPRESENTATIVES TO CONNECT WITH 
CONSTITUENTS, REMINDING PEOPLE 
TO REGISTER AND TO VOTE, AND 
GIVING PEOPLE A PLACE TO FREELY 
EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS ABOUT 
THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THEM. 
HOWEVER, WE HAVE ALSO SEEN WHAT 
CAN HAPPEN WHEN THE SERVICES 
ABUSE. 
-- SERVICE IS ABUSED. RUSSIA 
USED SOCIAL MEDIA AS PART OF A 
COMPREHENSIVE AND MULTIFACETED 
CAMPAIGN TO UNDERMINE 
DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS AND 
INTERFERE IN U.S. ELECTIONS AND 
THOSE OF OUR ALLIES. 
WE WERE TOO SLOW TO SPOT THIS
