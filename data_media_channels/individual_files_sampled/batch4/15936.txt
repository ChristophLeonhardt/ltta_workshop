celebrities hitch their wagon to another hashtag me to story but they really need to keep their powdered noses out of this one I'll tell you all about it coming up today on the Hollywood conservative for the rebel we've become accustomed to Hollywood types attaching their celebrity and star power to causes and candidates as long as stardom has existed people pushing for someone or something have used those with popular status to grow awareness or exposure or acclaim for whatever it is they're advocating what's new is how desperate celebrities have become and I guess how ignorant they appear to be just to remain relevant or politically connected that seems kind of new since Barack Obama turned the White House into a presidential party pad they used to be happy staying in their little New York or LA bubble partying in the Hollywood Hills but now they want to party in the White House and connect themselves to high-powered political figures so of course now we hear of the support as if on cue for the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment celebrities stand in solidarity with Christine Blasi for and making themselves look even more ridiculous and predictable then before have they read the allegations have they read her list of demands regarding her testimony before the Senate do they know the legal constraints and requirements for an FBI investigation never mind the second round of allegations that are even more controversial and ludicrous than the first they are standing in solidarity with a woman who is laying out her demands for her testimony before the United States Senate that's not how this works that's not how any of this works you don't get to dictate your terms to the United States Senate and while we are on the subject of testimonies I wouldn't be surprised if when all is said and done Brett Kavanaugh emerges as the only one of this scenario willing to testify under penalty of perjury because I'm fairly dubious as to whether Ford is even going to show up on Thursday she laid out these demands that are almost unbeatable she demands that Kavanagh testifies first are you freaking kidding me in what justice system in what country in any first world country hell even any third world country does that exist as part of the judicial process how is the man supposed to defend himself if he doesn't know the charges and she doesn't want him to be in the room that's literally anti-constitutional a defendant has the right to face his or her accuser she doesn't want to be questioned by any attorneys only senators which means translates to Democrat senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee are going to use this as an opportunity to grandstand virtue signal and basically utilize this as an audition for the next office they want to hold or keep and because all of the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee happened to be white men she is going to complain and be moan about how unfairly she was treated so this is the woman celebrities want to go to bat for it's not really that surprising and it's almost like they're trying to prove to the world that their brains only function to memorize scripts and not for cognitive reasoning I know there are smart celebrities out there I know there are smart actors out there I know one personally one but it's the empty barrels who make the most noise and that is who we are hearing now thanks so much for watching everybody I'm Amanda head the Hollywood conservative for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and want to hear more from all of us here at the rebel subscribe to our premium content at
