probably overall I've interviewed close to 300 people in the past couple years but with through various podcasts and I can tell you all of these people are successful whether I was talking to Mark Cuban or Arianna Huffington or Coolio or Barbara Corcoran and I really wanted to find out what causes success and I'll tell you the most important skill is simply showing up every day for a long time so hard work every day for a long time let's just take the rapper Coolio so we had the number one song it was called gangster's paradise in 1979 he started writing rap lyrics down every single day so that means for 15 years he was writing every day in the worst neighborhood one of the worst neighborhoods in the country every day until he had that big hit that's hard work that's patience that's showing up every single day once you have that success you can't stop that either you have to keep doing it or else you turn into the one-hit wonder or the one business wonder you look at great companies like Apple and Google particularly Apple is well known for reinventing itself okay one from a computer company to a music company to a phone company to a tablet company what kind of company are there gonna be a virtual reality company how many industries are they going to disrupt soso recreating yourself reinventing yourself this is part of the process of hard work and and you know learning from others every day doing things yourself every day and just showing up every day that's the most important skill I've seen out of these hundreds of people I've interviewed
