look strikes Carlene something over the immigration crisis if you like well this is a pretty hefty debate soaring rates amongst the highest in the Western world and it's contributing everything from traffic chaos to very high house prices now I'm an immigrant myself from Bangladesh now I think it's really critical for any country to foster dynamism and new energy so I certainly I agree overall with bringing in immigrants but there's obviously limits now Donald Trump is now I the focus on skilled migrants the countries like Canada and Australia have now I think this is realistic because there's a much bigger a challenge of integrating unskilled margaret's now I joke if the Statue of Liberty Description we're in today might say something like this give me your educated those that might saw the ones that do well on the skills test score now okay it's not as inspiring as the original lines celebrating the promise of America to unlock the potential of the world's poor but it does illustrate today's reality now often the debating and migration pits natives against immigrants now this misses the fact that the group most affected by home aggression other immigrants especially newly arrived immigrants now this is outlined well but one of my favorite thinkers reihan Salam writing in the National Review and I'll quote the ongoing influx of less skilled workers puts economic pressure on the less skilled immigrants who already reside in our country and it reinforces their cultural separation from those who belong to other ethnic groups so this way by including all immigrants figures like in Australia like Tony Abbott major politician you can potentially alienate allies among ethnic groups who can also see the dangers of unskilled migration now to be fair another issue is there are a lot of new immigrants they're not gonna be so affected by traffic or congestion you know if I just come from Mumbai or sheds in place like Sydney Melbourne Toronto they look like prosperous fishing villages there regardless globalization automation automation put enormous pressure on the wages of low-skilled labor now decades past immigrants who struggled economically or maybe wanted to keep stronger ancestral ties with their native countries then go home today there's you've got in intensive welfare safety net as well as communications technologies which means that your incentives to go return home are much lower in Australian low-skilled migrant labor usually comes in the form of refugees those that arrive through family reunion which almost a third of our intake and lots from New Zealand as well who have sort of special privileges here now many international students who come here is permanent residents even though they're categorized as skilled where they get residency they actually ended up getting pretty shoddy degrees and end up in the unskilled labor market you know if you're native at least you can make use of your superior English we're low skilled migrants compete against other migrants at the bottom of the labor market they also increase the productivity of skilled workers like me because we can outsource mundane tasks to cheap immigrant labor so this actually worsens inequalities now refugees a really good example had her challenging it is to gain an economic foothold for those of say limited skills and not the best English now a local academic Peter whiteford who's at the Australian National University studied refugees in Australia between 2002 and now the initially is you know people pretty driven and wanted to find work but we did it for you years they all shifted to the disability pension which you're often for mental health reasons and this is exactly what I should see what migrants you know arrive wide-eyed full of hope and they're usually ashamed to accept welfare but you better come demoralized especially in today's labor market challenges now what wife had found is that a decade later refugees before times more likely to be on welfare I mean it's pretty significant in the past they might have just joined factories but they can't do that anymore now the offspring are likely to be more successful but if we have poorer outcomes now for Refugees there's a risk that the next generation will be the underemployed or the deviant of our society and some of the problems in Sudanese youth we've had in Australia illustrate this so you really you could argue some of the money spent on refugees locally could be spent elsewhere I why the top migration experts in the world Oxford professor Paul Collier he looked at countries like Canada Australia Norway who we actually spend them on resettlement over a hundred thousand dollars a year per refugee now if you spent this money elsewhere for example the Jordanian government supports special economic zones that might allow Syrian refugees to work there while live in exile this might be a far better solution now another interesting social issue that comes from bringing in less skilled migrants is that they're more likely to marry people of their own ethnic background including going back to their native countries for arranged marriages now this registers in our generous family reunion program which is you know what's a third of our total intake now this might seem harmless but over time such trends heighten an ethnic identity at the expense of a more cohesive national one you know the spouse are also likely to be under skilled two at a time with the so many debates going on national identity this sort of trend presents complications needs a marriage between ethnic groups is actually critical to avoid social fracture into competing ethnic tribes no marker but countries like Australia and Canada success there are high rates of mixed marriage now estranged future like Canada's you know really depends on a degree of migration to support our aging population now we both have an appropriate focus on skilled migration but when you consider the high levels of unskilled migration anyway and the fact that integrating them has never been tougher you know these policies might not even be strict enough
