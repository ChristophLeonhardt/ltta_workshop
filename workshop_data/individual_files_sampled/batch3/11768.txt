hundreds of interpreters who worked with the British Army in Afghanistan are facing the threat of deportation from the UK that's despite a promise from Britain that they would be allowed to stay we spoke to one of those affected who says the only thing that awaits him back in Afghanistan is death if they deport me back there's only one choice for me to be killed he doesn't know when but the UK Home Office has informed Abdul Bari that he's going to be deported to Kabul within the next three months Abdul says he can't go back to Afghanistan because he worked as a frontline interpreter for British forces from 2008 to 2010 my life was in danger my family life was in danger they're threatening me that they told me that we we know that you joined the infidels leave the job and after that there was only one choice for me that I must leave the country because the the second target that the main target was for them meat so if they catch me there they would definitely kill me but I just Fleet the country the British defense secretary Gavin Williamson has made headlines in recent days by telling the Home Office that Afghan interpreters should be allowed to stay in the UK but that reassurance only refers to around 400 former interpreters who had been given five-year UK visas they expire soon and all the authorities have done in reality is say that they'll waive the costly renewal fees so those celebratory headlines don't apply to the 600 or so former Afghan interpreters still in Kabul who have had their asylum claims rejected nor do they apply to the handful of complicated cases relating to former interpreters who were forced to flee and entered the UK illegally like Abdul well all of us are delighted that those who've met all the criteria and their families are here and we'll stay here and they're not on your penny money there are still people who are being looked at and we need to be careful that we don't let any fall through the nets we have a debt of honor to the people and what we mustn't do is leave someone who actually worked for us looked after our soldiers helped us we mustn't leave someone like that in a position where they and their families will be at risk and we've got to be very clear and make sure we don't do that Abdul says he didn't have time to apply for a visa through the official interpreter scheme while he was still in Kabul that required months of waiting and his life was increasingly at risk now Abdul lawyer is appealing the Home Office's moves to deport him many interpreters got visas directly from Afghanistan through the ministry defences relocation visa there's very strict criteria that requires you to be working in Helmand province and to be made redundant on or after the 19th of December 2012 a lot of people like mr. berry weren't working in 2012 because they were threatened and targeted by the Taliban had to quit their jobs and flee it's not really fair that he's had to make this journey to the UK to escape these threats to be told actually door horn they're saying it's safe for him to relocate there we have evidence from former employers not just from the British Army but they also he was working with in the in Kabul when he relocated today originally to escape threats that evidence suggests he was threatened in in Kabul and if he was back there the same will happen again he will be targeted when it comes to its own citizens the UK government clearly warns against travel to almost all of Afghanistan even districts in the heavily guarded capital Kabul it adds that terrorists are very likely to carry out attacks and methods are evolving and increasing in sophistication but that's apparently safe enough for Abdul Bari to return as far as the UK government's concerned I don't think Kapil is safe because I think couple is the most dangerous place in the world at the moment because every day bomb is exploding people are dying and I don't know how the Home Office is saying the Kabul is safe I first met Abdul a couple of months ago since then his already fragile mental state has worsened I was surviving 35 pound a week and very tiny accommodations I'm not allowed to work so I can't do nothing at all so I have a very bad depression so I've been to the GP many times and had some medicine from them but that doesn't work on and I'm still struggling I asked him about what he wants to do if and after all this he wants to work he'd read economics at University in Kabul he wouldn't mind resurrecting his professional boxing career either but his talk is tentative working and living here sounds like a dream one that any day now could come crashing down with the arrival of a final deportation letter you
