now it is time for me to put on my smart glasses and mop the sweat off my brow and read the final thought if prosperity preachers like Joel Osteen encourage you to do better for yourself there doesn't seem to me anything particularly wrong with that within that narrow scope that Osteen sets for himself perhaps his message can encourage people if so go with God the worry is that people might take him for something that he himself admits that he's not in the weight of glory CS Lewis describes heresy not as the promotion of Vice over virtue but rather as the promotion of some particular virtue over all the others charity to the exclusion of prudence justice to the exclusion of charity the power of positive thinking is neither a theological nor a cardinal virtue and it shouldn't be confused for one lest another Lewis admonition creep up on you he warns if you look for truth you may find comfort in the end if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin and in the end despair on that despairing note I am Michael Knowles this is the Michael Nolt show come back tomorrow and we'll give you hope you
