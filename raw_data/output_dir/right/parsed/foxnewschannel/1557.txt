WORTH HIS WHILE OR THE NORTH
KOREAN'S WHILE?
LET'S GET THE READ FROM BLAKE
BURMAN AT THE WHITE HOUSE.
HI, BLAKE.
>> HI, NEIL.
WHAT IS CLEAR HERE, THERE'S A
DISPARITY TODAY.
WE HAVE THE SOUTH KOREAN
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER BEFORE
THE MEETING THAT TOOK PLACE WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT
MOON SAYING THERE'S A 99.9%
CHANCE THAT THIS MEETING WILL
HAPPEN JUNE 12.
THAT WAS THE READ OF THE SOUTH
KOREANS.
PRESIDENT TRUMP SITS DOWN, TAKES
QUESTIONS AND HE SEEMS TO
SUGGEST THAT MAYBE THIS MIGHT
NOT HAPPEN AT ALL, MAYBE IT
MIGHT NOT HAPPEN AFTER JUNE 12.
HE GAVE A MESSAGE THAT WE HEARD
THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, WHICH IS
THIS.
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
IN ANY EVENT, THE SECOND WEEK IN
A ROW NOW, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE
WOULD OFFER UP SECURITY
PROTECTIONS.
HE TRIED TO MAKE THIS PITCH TO
THE NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR THAT A
BETTER FUTURE COULD LIE AHEAD.
>> WE WILL GUARANTEE HIS SAFETY.
WE TALKED ABOUT THAT FROM THE
BEGINNING.
HE WILL BE SAFE, HE WILL BE
HAPPY, HIS COUNTRY WILL BE RICH.
HIS COUNTRY WILL BE HARD WORKING
AND VERY PROSPEROUS.
>> HOWEVER, NEIL, THAT RAISES
THE QUESTION WHY A DICTATOR THAT
HAS REPRESSED HIS PEOPLE FOR
YEARS AND HIS FAMILY DID SO
SHOULD BE OFFERED A SECURITY
BLANKET?
THE PRESS SECRETARY SARAH
SANDERS WAS ASKED EARLIER TODAY
IF THAT WOULD BE MORALLY RIGHT.
>> THE GOAL AND THE PURPOSE OF
THESE CONVERSATIONS WOULD BE TO
HAVE COMPLETE AND TOTAL
DENUCLEARIZATION OF THE
PENINSULA, AND THE PRESIDENT HAS
BEEN UP FRONT ABOUT THAT PART OF
THE CONVERSATION.
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE
FORWARD.
>> BACK TO THE TIMELINE.
THE WHITE HOUSE WAS ASKED, SARAH
SANDERS WAS ASKED IF THERE'S A
DROP DEAD DATE FOR THIS MEETING
TO OCCUR.
SHE WOULDN'T SAY WHEN THAT DATE
MIGHT BE.
NEIL?
>> Neil: DID YOU GET A READ,
BLAKE, THEY'RE GETTING CYNICAL
NOW, THAT THEY'RE NOT AS
OPTIMISTIC AS THEY WERE, THAT
SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THAT
SECOND MEETING OF THE NORTH
KOREAN LEADER MEETING WITH THE
CHINESE PRESIDENT THAT SOMETHING
TRANSPIRED THINGS?
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID AS MUCH.
ONE OF THE BIG GRIPES SITTING
DOWN WITH PRESIDENT MOON, HE
FEELS THAT THE SECOND MEETING
THAT OCCURRED WITH KIM JONG-UN
AND PRESIDENT XI THAT THE U.S.
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT, THAT
SOMETHING HAPPENED AFTER THE
FACT AND WE NOW KNOW THAT THE
NORTH KOREANS PULLED IT BACK,
BUT PRESIDENT TRUMP FEELS THAT
SOMETHING HAPPENED IN THAT
SECOND UNANNOUNCED MEETING THAT
MAYBE LEAVES NORTH KOREA TO SAY,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE WANT TO WALK
AWAY FROM THIS.
OF COURSE, THEY ARE POINTING THE
FINGER AT JOHN BOLTON AND HIS
COMMENTS THAT HE MADE A COUPLE
WEEKS BACK ABOUT THE LIBYA MODEL
BEING THE MODEL THAT SHOULD BE
USED FOR DENUCLEARIZATION.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO
QADDAFI.
THE PRESIDENT SAID TODAY, NEIL,
THAT THEY FEEL SOMETHING MIGHT
HAVE HAPPENED DURING THE SECOND
MEETING.
IT ALL
