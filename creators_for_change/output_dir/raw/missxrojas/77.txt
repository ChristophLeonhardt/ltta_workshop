hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone I'm in Vegas right now which</font>

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,350
is why I have this lovely blue velvet

00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,240
sofa I'm making<font color="#CCCCCC"> a video today to talk</font>

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,160
about political engagement and ways in

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,590
which we can concretely contribute to

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,420
the brexit negotiations that are coming

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">up oh well they're in process right now</font>

8
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:16,139
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a deadline coming</font>

9
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,490
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making this video in partnership</font>

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,020
with undivided which is a youth-led

11
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,210
political campaign from people all over

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,789
the breakfast spectrum as it were people

13
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,590
who voted leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who voted remain</font>

14
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,390
and people who didn't vote undivided

15
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus is ensuring that the priorities of</font>

16
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,520
young people are included in the brexit

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,440
deal negotiations young people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have</font>

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,820
to live with the ramifications of

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,440
whatever deal is made so it's really

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,450
important that those considerations are

21
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,340
included in the discussion as a bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,290
time crunch here so undivided is going

23
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,700
to take the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 demands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by young</font>

24
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,309

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:49,079
January 2017 before I not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

26
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,010
everything else somewhere to say I just

27
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to say up top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can go to we</font>

28
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">are and divided current UK and submit</font>

29
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,590
what it is you want the government to

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,079
consider your demand as it were in the

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,520
brexit negotiations and that has a

32
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,050
chance then of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the demands</font>

33
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,449
presented to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Parliament in January 2017</font>

34
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:05,820
which is about a month away it's

35
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,799
alarming it soon it's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

36
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,909
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of things from some</font>

37
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">more broad some more specific here I</font>

38
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,350
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's vital that we look at</font>

39
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,509
the processes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen in between</font>

40
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,130
major political events by major

41
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,570
political events I mean things like

42
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">elections and referendums and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UK at</font>

43
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,049
least I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of election</font>

44
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,400
fatigue there's the general election in

45
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,890
2015 we have the EU referendum and then

46
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,750
it kind of felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. election</font>

47
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,430
was happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us as well partly</font>

48
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of the ramifications of this big</font>

49
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,490
country and here they voted for but also

50
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,740
because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that our countries</font>

51
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,540
interact with one another I understand

52
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,579
people needing to step back I needed to

53
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:40,380
set back as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I needed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

54
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,869
minute but it's stepping back entirely

55
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,490
that worries me it's saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

56
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,250
politics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> politicians in general</font>

57
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,869
don't do anything or they're only

58
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,270
interested in themselves or those kind

59
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">of broad sweeping statements that</font>

60
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,869
worries me because it makes us less

61
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:56,969
engaged in the process when actually

62
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,860
what we need to be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is getting more</font>

63
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,180
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to be calling and</font>

64
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,829
emailing our MPs and other people who

65
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,450
represent us locally it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not simply</font>

66
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,680
about knowing the headlines and knowing

67
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,180
what's being talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that top</font>

68
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,098
level it's also understanding how

69
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,530
politics works and whose priorities have

70
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,750
been considered and part of that is

71
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,940
whose voices are out there whose voices

72
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,880
are included who is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely to show</font>

73
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,740
up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the polls so all of these things</font>

74
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">are involved with other aspects</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of how</font>

75
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,860
do we make voting easier why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that</font>

76
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,380
so many older people come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote</font>

77
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,270
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of young people often don't</font>

78
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,470
the sort things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a lot</font>

79
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">around the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those big political</font>

80
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,010
events but then forget about about a

81
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,080
month<font color="#CCCCCC"> later and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hamilton terms elections</font>

82
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,610
are deciding who's in the room where it

83
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,959
happened but the master of what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

84
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">in that room where it happens whether</font>

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,050
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 Downing Street houses of</font>

parliament your local councillors office

87
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,020
the more those meetings and discussions

88
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,420
seem obscure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and separate from us the</font>

89
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,160
less<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're likely to get involved and</font>

unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're likely to see it as</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can be part of and</font>

92
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,510
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to request</font>

93
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,430
be included as a priority the brexit

94
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,870
negotiations I've been thinking a lot

95
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,630
about how these nebulous concepts like

96
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,720
the EU and trade and all of these big

97
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,080
sore bureaucratic feeling words face off

98
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,830
against ideas that are concrete and bite

99
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">sized like 350 million pounds to the NHS</font>

100
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,080
or whatever one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i</font>

101
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,489
generally love about this campaign<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

102
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,799
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get involved is that it</font>

103
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,989
takes this nebulous idea of the brexit

104
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,630
negotiation or hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> brexit soft brexit</font>

105
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,269
and breaks it down into those chunks so

106
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:29,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only do we lay out our</font>

107
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,630
priorities we also in the process

108
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,880
understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is being discussed</font>

109
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,470
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applies for</font>

110
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,420
everyone not just young people one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

111
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,470
the biggest priorities for me personally

112
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,150
is protecting the right to live work and

113
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,769
study iddy you and the rights of the

114
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,570
members of the EU<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live work and study</font>

115
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,519
in the UK to give you further examples a

116
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,780
couple of other issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are really</font>

117
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,190
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me are upholding the</font>

118
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,260
cosmetics ban on testing in the EU

119
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,810
further extending those protections<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

120
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,459
animal welfare and concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

121
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,930
effect the brexit negotiations will have

122
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,579
on human rights specifically as the

123
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,680
refugee crisis continues seeing what's

124
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,630
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> in for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Australia with</font>

125
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,489
the prison Islands and also what we're

126
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,590
already doing as a country i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

127
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,410
appalling so I'm really really worried

128
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that connected to that I worry</font>

129
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,980
about hate crimes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love our</font>

130
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,709
government to commit to measures that

131
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:15,209
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use to tackle hate</font>

132
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,390
crimes specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this post brexit</font>

133
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,029
Britain what we have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rise in hate</font>

134
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,130
crimes whatever they can do to your

135
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,760
store people but then also

136
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,220
actually act in response to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

137
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,420
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

138
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,550
included in those negotiations and I

139
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,760
think should be part of that broader EU

140
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,980
UK effort so hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives you a bit</font>

141
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,060
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> an idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the kinds of things</font>

142
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,650
that you can submit to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> websites it's</font>

143
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,270
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> priority to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you as a young person in</font>
