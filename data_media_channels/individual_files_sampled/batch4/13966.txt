in the wake of President trump's release of a tax reform outline CNN sallycousens took to Twitter to explain her take on the prospective legislation she tweeted translated Trump's tax plan for ian's a picture of firm's tax plan and written over it in pink penances take dollars from the people give it to the super-rich this is not how taxes work there is a basic inconsistency here for Kohn she's correct that higher taxes on a relatively small percentage of the middle class via reduction of tax deductions would involve government taking more money from those affected but she then suggests that rich Americans paying less taxes somehow amounts to reallocation of resources from middle-class to those in the top tax bracket so in other words taxation is theft when it's applied to those who aren't in the top quintile of income earners but for those rich folks taxation is an expected tribute to be paid to the government here is the question at what income cutoff does taxation become good Kohn doesn't say but this is pure illogical class warfare when told this on Twitter Cohn responded that you didn't appreciate mansplaining shiro mansplaining his caring am i right sally it's called economics planning and we wouldn't have to do it if you would logic understand Cohn also ignores the fact that the rich pay the overwhelming majority of net taxes in the United States according to the Tax Foundation in 2014 35% of Americans paid no income tax those earning more than $250,000 paid 55 percent of the entire income tax burden the top 20% of earners paid 84 percent of all income tax according to the Tax Policy Center according to the CBO the Congressional Budget Office report on distribution of taxes in 2013 the top 1% of households paid 34 percent of their income to federal taxes the middle 20% paid just 12.8% the top quintile of income households paid an average of 57 thousand seven hundred dollars into federal tax coffers in 2013 when you include any wealth transfers they were paid by the federal government the fourth highest quintile paid twenty six hundred bucks the middle quintile paid actually made seventy eight hundred dollars from the feds and the second lowest quintile made twelve thousand dollars lowest quintile made eighty eight hundred bucks bottom line according to the American Enterprise Institute the highest income quintile is financing ninety-six percent of the entire system of transfer payments to the bottom sixty percent and funding the operation of the federal government so no the returned under tax they're paying for the whole operation we actually have the most progressive federal tax system among all osed twenty four countries but keep banging that drum alik I'm Ben Shapiro this is the Ben Shapiro show so after that auspicious start we'll jump right in in just a second talking about what's going on with Ann Coulter and the rise of fascism in the United States I feel like I have a particularly good window on this since I've actually been at the center of some of these campus riot type events but first I want to say thank you to our sponsors over at lyft so if you are looking for a ride-sharing app if you are looking for a way to get from point A to point B in the safest and cleanest possible fashion lyft is the app that does it's as I've said many times on the program before my wife comes back very often

promo code Shapiro in the payment section okay so the big issue of the day obviously is what's been happening in Berkeley so a couple of points you made about this right off the bat first off and does not have any obligation to go to Berkeley so if I were an coulter what I go to Berkeley maybe I would seriously consider it but I would also consider the possibility that I wouldn't actually want to be shot in the face and that's the problem here is that you know I've been at the center of some of these incidents but an Tifa which is now prominent in Berkeley they actually engage in physical violence we've had on two guests in the last week talking about the sort of violence they engage in we had on base nick bannin we had on lauren southern talk about the the violence that is now occurring in Berkeley with an Tifa at the head of it that is a different thing than a lot of these students so we have a lot of students who made trouble when I was at Cal State Los Angeles there was a near riot there some people got beat up in the crowd but it wasn't anything like what you're saying at Berkeley with the blood flowing and people throwing sticks of dynamite and such into the crowd that's a new thing and I don't blame Ann for not wanting to die in the middle of Berkeley you know I think that there's a strong case that you should go anyway with a bullhorn but it's it's totally up to her I'm not gonna rip her for that by the same token I'm certainly not gonna rip young America's Foundation full disclosure I work with them all the time I'm not gonna rip young America's foundation for doing what they're supposed to do in this situation which is protect their students it is not Young America foundations fault that the that the police are refusing to defend the free speech rights of people participating at University of California Berkeley yeah has legal liability if ya were to go there and then some of their students were to get hurt there's a possibility that Yap gets sued and you have can't have that because they are a 501c3 organization they have an obligation to protect their students EF was not anti the event EF was Pro the event it was Yap back in the events all the way down the line until it was made clear that the police were gonna let an Tifa run roughshod over the people who are going to show up I know that you have stands by its people because you have stood by me when DePaul threatened to arrest me yes stood by me when CSULA threatened to cancel my event we walked right into it anyway so this idea that's being promulgated by some sort of anti eff folks on Twitter that yeah f is weak on this stuff it's just not true yeah filed the lawsuit alongside me against Cal State LA they've filed the lawsuit alongside Ann Coulter against the University of Berkeley system the idea that they have some sort of obligation to push their students to go to an event where the students are gonna get hurt that seems to me foolish if the students want to go the students are free to go they're adults but you know putting it on ya facility there's really only one group to blame here two groups to blame and Tifa obviously because they are fascists and their fascist to engage in violence for political reasons but the bigger problem here is bigger than an t fight it's a bigger problem than an Tifa in the 1960s when rioters basically took over University of California at Berkeley the governor was Ronald Reagan and Ronald Reagan sent in the National Guard he called in the National Guard and they literally marched into Berkeley took over the place and tamp down whatever violence was taking place they kicked people out of the public buildings they had occupied where the hell is Jerry Brown the governor of the state of California what is the mayor of Berkeley doing and the answer is that they are all standing by and letting their Brown shoots brown shirts do the work this is a common thing in fascist in fascist tyrannies you let the the sort of wild men go and do the violence stuff and then you have a police stand by I mean not to the the comparison is is not full but it is just a demonstration of how fascism works during crystal mocked in in Germany it was not actually the police forces overall that were going out and burning down synagogues and beating up Jews for the most part it was members of the brown shirts which just sort of paramilitary organization who are going around doing all this stuff and the police were told to back off and let it happen this is what fascist dictatorships do they don't want to have all of the violence on their own head they don't want to be blamed for all the violence so instead what they do is they activate people like Han Tifa they like they let an Tifa go out there and burn things and threaten people and hit people with sticks and clubbed people and stabbed people and throw dynamite at people and then they tell the cops back off and let them do it okay that is just as fascist as the fascists who are actually participating in this nonsense and it is really quite frightening it's very frightening it's very scary and it is totally inappropriate obviously and it is violative of the First Amendment again this idea that Berkeley's putting out there that we can't guarantee safety let me ask a question if Donaghy C code says left-wing radical who's become a public intellectual on the Left if Donaghy C codes were to speak at Berkeley and a bunch of white supremacists were to show up you know that the the Fantom Trump supporters who are all the neo-nazi Trump supporters the media worries about supposedly and let's say they were all to show up at once and they were gonna protest tondc Coates in a violent way do you think Berkeley would tell the cops to stand down or do you think they'd tell them to charge in their batons waving and do you think that Jerry Brown would call out the National Guard obviously Jerry Brown would call out the National Guard of course he would but that's not what the University is doing instead the University says quote this University's Nicholas Dirk's who's the university's chancellor he says this University has two non-negotiable commitments one's a free speech the other two the safety of our campus community members their guests and the public in that context we cannot ignore or deny what is a new reality groups and individuals from the extreme ends of the political spectrum have made it clear their readiness and intentions violent tactics in support or in protest of certain speakers at UC Berkeley we cannot wish away or pretend these threats do not exist okay no one is saying they should wish away or pretend the threats don't exist we're saying you should counter the threats that is your job you're the G as the University Chancellor you have a UC PD I know I went to UCLA you have a UCPD use the UCPD coordinate with the Berkeley Police the cops who are there I guarantee you are not sympathetic to an Tifa they're not sitting there going oh well I'm just gonna sit here and let an sefa do what they're doing this is a political move by people at the top to allow all of this crap to happen and this has become a trend across the country in violent situations and non violent situations at Middlebury College now one student not one has been suspended or expelled for physically assaulting a professor or left-wing professor who ended up with a concussion not one when I was at University of Wisconsin a bunch of protesters took over the front of the stage nonviolent protestors I thought it was ridiculous and funny but they held up the entire thing for like 20 minutes and I said to the cops why don't you just move them out they don't have a right to do this why don't you just move them on out and they said well we've been told by the administration that if we move these people out we will also have to shut down the event in other words it is up to the protesters to be nice people and if they're not nice people the cops won't do anything about it this has become common across the country university administrators who are too cowardly who are too pathetic who are too fascistic to shut down people who want to destroy free speech and is not equivalent when you say protestor doesn't have the right to shut down a full free speech event that is not the equivalent of shutting down a free speech event these two things are not equal when I say a protestor who tries to take over an event assault people prevent people from hearing speech that is not the same as the speaker themselves I'm fine with protesters who want to protest and not disturb the event I'm fine with protesters yelling at me every so often I don't care that's First Amendment stuff but when you have people who shut down events when you have people who threaten violence like antiva it is your obligation as a police force it is your obligation as governor of the state of California or mayor of Berkeley or PD chief it is your obligation to protect the liberty of people okay the police are not just there to protect your life the police are also there to protect your liberty and this idea that the University gets a violent threat and all of a sudden going to shut down the right again they're just using the violent protesters as a proxy for they don't want this event to go forward this is tobias they should be sued and they should lose and the university said it was impossible for the police department to simply step in and stop violent confrontations they said this is a university not a battlefield well if you wanted to be not a battlefield then perhaps you should actually have defense and this idea that you can just declare it's not its university not a battlefield that's not what Antipa thinks they've already made it a battlefield in fact there's a map going around that NC fuh has put out a various sites I guess that Gavin McInnes and Lauren southern are supposed to speak in place of an today or tomorrow and the and the antifa people have put out like a full military map of the area it is not up to Berkeley whether this place is a battlefield it is a battlefield because an tyfa has made it a battlefield if you wanted to be a free and open place of learning it is your job with my taxpayer dollars I'm a California taxpayer it is your job with my taxpayer dollars to defend freedom and the fact that they're not doing it is ridiculous the police chief Andrew Greenwood he told the Berkeley City Council I believe that's the same City Council that voted to impeach Donald Trump because this is how crazy they are he said intervention requires a major commitment of resources a significant use of force and carries with it the strong likelihood of the harm of harming those who are not committing a crime why does it carry with it the strong likelihood of harming those who are not committing a crime why I hope that it requires a major commitment of resources in a significant use of force I hope that you clobber these antiva people or actual fascists or participating in violence police have an obligation to maintain law and order and we've seen all over the United States that left wingers do not care about violence so long as it Springs from the left we saw the mayor of Baltimore say that she wanted to provide safe spaces for people to riot in Baltimore they're burning down businesses and she was talking about safe spaces you know I see the same thing at Berkeley have you ever seen have you ever said not in my lifetime at least have you ever seen a right-wing mayor say that he's fine with violence in the streets so long as it promotes violent right-wing causes have you seen that I haven't seen that certainly not in modern history and yet the left is doing this on a routine basis the left is doing it over and over and over again this is an assault on free speech and everybody right left and center should be calling it an assault on free speech it doesn't matter what you think of Ann Coulter that's completely irrelevant but according to the left all that matters is that they don't like ankled her so bob beckel the the living troll on fox news is the five he came out and he was ripping on Ann Coulter as those Coulter's fault that all this was happening why can't the university protect Anne Coulter I mean they have the money they have the manpower why can't they do it Bob well first of all let me let me just say how disappointed I am and all of you suggesting that this is something to do with the Democrats and liberals these are anarchists who are coming in from around the country who have nothing to do with the Democratic Party Howard Dean is an anarchist in himself the reason I for n calls was speaking and she has a right to speak number one and every time she opens her mouth boy it drives away more people she's becoming more more irrelevant so she does something like this to get a lot of attention this is the woman who said America is been graced by a Christian God that Donald Trump is president that wasn't all she heard Marco Rubio a rapist and three buckle is standing up for Coulter's right to speak there are people on the Left who haven't been the ACLU is even standing up her right to speak but the people in power aren't and that's the only thing that matters so I guess good for Bob Beckel in one sense but it is just ridiculous it is ridiculous that so many members of the of the administration the mayor of Berkeley that they are going to allow this to to go ahead it's really disgusting apparently Berkeley's mayor has he called out I love this he called out an Coulter for stoking possible violence so mayor Jessie era Gwynn an aha pronounce the names at Berkeley is about the exchange of ideas but that's not what's happening so I think going forward we are going to need to have a more visible police president sat presence of these incidents and intervene yeah think you think you idiot but he blamed Ann Coulter for all of this he said that it's Ann Coulter and Milo who are causing this again this is the same argument as her skirt was short therefore she was asking to be raped it's the exact same argument and it is truly disgusting and this had better come under control or people are gonna pay the price with their lives people are going to get killed and I hope it's not me because I'm the one speaking of campus more often than not so it's really disturbing to me personally and before I go on on this I want to talk about ESPN I want to talk about Obamacare repeal I want to talk about taxes and trade in the borders a lot to get to today before we get to the mailbag but before we do that I want to say thank you to our advertisers over at C so calm se es

about what's going on at ESPN so ESPN fired a hundred people yesterday and there's a lot of big names they fired yesterday they fired a bunch of people who I enjoy watching NFL reporter Edward ER was was fired NFL analyst Trent Dilfer was fired MLB writer Jason Stark was fired the entire NHL reporting team was fired and yet and yet total buffoons like Max Kellerman still on the air the all the guests from around the horn still on the air we definitely need Kevin Blackistone telling us how the national anthem is a war anthem he actually said that on around the horn we still need him to opine on the virtues of Caitlyn Jenner hasn't been athletically relevant for my entire lifetime but we have to get rid of you know the actual people who report sports this is because ESPN has made a conscious decision it's the same decision the Democrats made in 2012 that they're going for a new demographic that's really what this is about and no one wants to talk about it so I'm gonna tell you the truth about what ESPN is doing ESPN has made a conscious decision that they are going to program leftist politics because they believe that their growing demographic base the people who are watching sports more particularly sports like the NBA are black and Hispanic and so they think that if they put on more hosts who are black and Hispanic and left then they are going to gain more black and Hispanic viewership and they don't seem to care that they are losing alot of viewers who are conservative in the process this is why the NHL is going right the overwhelming majority of people who watch the NHL are white the overwhelming well not the over the disproportionate percentage of people who watch the NBA is black according to the Nielsen statistics and they've decided the NBA is more important than the NHL the NBA is a lot bigger than the NHL but you don't have that you could do both I mean if you're a sports Network you just cover the highlights and you tell me what I need to know in the news that's why I used to watch SportsCenter because it was clever and it was witty and because people were funny it was back in the day when Keith Olbermann didn't feel the need to talk politics and it was just it was interesting and fun to watch I used to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning when I was a kid to watch SportsCenter every morning every morning I get up at 6 a.m. to watch SportsCenter because that's how much I loved ESPN and that's how much I loved SportsCenter and they've decided to absolutely destroy it they decide it's more important to hire Jamil Hill and Michael Smith for a million bucks a year in order to babble about Donald Trump than it is to actually have reporters like as I say Jason Stark was a fantastic reporter for Major League Baseball it's really terrible ESPN's public editor said that the network would continue to push politics they said the desire to throw a boundary between sports culture and politics is a fool's errand the volume of non sports content within ESPN's Empire has increased significantly in recent years some of that has been driven by the athletes ESPN covers who have in recent years begun to speak more forcefully about societal and political issues you want to know why they're doing that because ESPN covers them when they do it so to pretend that it's the athletes who just suddenly decided to speak politically is nonsense athletes were speaking politically thirty years ago as this guy as he as he acknowledges the difference is that ESPN has now decided to make socially active athletes the heroes of their little morality plays there are those of us like me who just want to watch with a baseball all I want to do is watch MLB Network now I'd rather watch MLB Network and watch Kevin Millar talk about nonsense about baseball than I will if I want to watch politics I'll watch politics and a lot of watch baseball watch baseball I don't need your take on Caitlyn Jenner's heroism and transgenderism in the Olympics I don't need it okay in this idea that ESPN is just gonna keep preaching politics good I hope everyone keeps cutting the cable I hope that people keep tuning out there are two ways that ESPN makes money one way is from cable subscription fees the other way is from advertising their ratings have been plummeting they should plummet people are cutting the cord because the technology is changing and no one feels the need to subscribe to cable anymore I used to subscribe to cable specifically for ESPN and I'm going to unsubscribe from cable this week because there's nothing for me to watch on ESPN anymore because I have nothing to watch on ESPN I'm the day before they cut 100 of these reporters I'm day before they did that they ran a piece on ESPN's icons handled five poets on the new feminism on espn.com you think I want to read five poets on the new feminism I won't even read it if it appears at Jezebel I'm not gonna read it if it appears at everyday feminism and I love everyday feminism because it's hilarious but I'm certainly not gonna read it if it appears at espn.com again the left has infused every aspect of culture with politics and they shouldn't be surprised when the backlash is to infuse politics with culture which is one of the reasons that Donald Trump is the President of the United States well I want to talk a little bit more about all of that and then I want to get to the politics of the day Obamacare repeal and taxes and trade and the border I don't get to all of that plus the mail bag but you have to go over to daily wire.com for that you
