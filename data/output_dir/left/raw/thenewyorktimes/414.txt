1
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,519
I guess I saw this at first as
a kind of poker game.

2
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:35,949
I had been taking pictures with
the phone like Solitaire

3
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:40,980
and suddenly I had someone, a
partner to play this card game with.

4
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,720
Yeah, I think it's incredible how little 
we knew about each other

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,550
when we started and how much 
we know about each other now.

6
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,599
It was very thrilling for me
because first I never knew when

7
00:00:53,599 --> 00:00:57,740
you would post and my phone 
would just kind of indicate

8
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,099
when you had sent the picture 
and wherever I was, I would

9
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:03,770
kind of exit and secretly
look at the photograph.

10
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,899
I think the adventure was 
such a big part of it,

11
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:10,160
just to not know what the response 
is going to be or is it,

12
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,230
are we picking up a new thread? 
Or are we still building upon the previous one?

13
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:19,630
Never had dead ends to the 
conversation, never seemed to lag orâ€“

14
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,919
there was always a kind of new
avenue with each picture,

15
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:25,850
a continuation and the opening
of something new.

16
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,069
And I thought it was 
interesting too because you

17
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,840
know pregnancy is 
often cute babies

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,869
and tire tracks or you know
bunnies and kittens and

19
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:42,359
we have a lot of violence in the 
photos actually and a lot of kind of unease.

20
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,770
In a way that does go 
hand-in-hand with what was

21
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,719
happening in the country.

22
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,800
Yeah, I mean... it was definitely
I remember us telling each other

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,520
the following day that something was
really missing.

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,770
We had gotten really used to this
banter back and forth and

25
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:06,460
you know, we work so solitary so often
that to be able to get to do this is such a luxury.

26
00:02:06,460 --> 00:00:00,000
So we've already started our second segment. 
To be continued, to be continued.
