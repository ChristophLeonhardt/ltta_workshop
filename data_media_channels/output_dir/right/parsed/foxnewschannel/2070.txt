MEANT TO YOU.
>> MY DAD JOINED THE MARINES IN
1968.
HE WENT TO VIETNAM IN 1969.
HE SERVED THERE WITHIN A
MACHINE GUN PLATOON.
SO HE WAS IN THE INFANTRY.
IT WAS A ROUGH TIME FOR HIM.
HE WAS IN SERVICE FOR QUITE A
BIT OF TIME.
JUST BEING IN VIETNAM AS MANY
KNOW, WAS JUST REALLY TOUGH TO
BE OVER THERE.
IT IS STILL SOMETHING THAT SITS
WITH HIM TODAY.
HIS SERVICE HAS LED ME TO BE
HERE AND ELIGIBLE FOR A
SCHOLARSHIP WITHIN THE
FOUNDATION.
AND BEING PART OF THE
FOUNDATION HAS REALLY CHANGED
MY LIFE BECAUSE IT HELPED ME
PAY FOR SCHOOL.
WHEN I GRADUATED I ACTUALLY HAD
AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY FOR ME.
I JUST WANT TO DO EVERYTHING I
CAN TO PAY THIS BACK AND PAY IT
FORWARD FOR ANY OTHER STUDENT.
>> IT IS SUCH A RELIEF FOR KIDS
COMING OUT OF COLLEGE TO BE
DEBT-FREE BUT ALSO THE
CONNECTION GENERAL, THAT YOU
HELPED BETWEEN KIDS AND THE
SERVICE OF THE PARENTS.
AND THEIR REMINDER OF THE
SACRIFICE.
>> IT IS INCREDIBLE.
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR 36 YEARS FOR
THE KIDS GO THROUGH ANYTHING
FROM FINANCIAL TURMOIL TO
HAVING TO TAKE CHARGE OF OTHER
SIBLINGS AND HAVING A PARENT ON
DEPLOYMENT.
ALSO BECAUSE OF THE COMBAT
DEPLOYMENTS THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THE PERSON MAY NOT COME
HOME OR COULD BE SEVERELY
WOUNDED.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AMANDA YOU STOOD ON STAGE AT
THE EVENT.
WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN TO YOU?
>> IT JUST MEANS SO MUCH!
THEY HAVE GIVEN ME SO MANY
OPPORTUNITIES AND I WILL
FOREVER BE GRATEFUL FOR IT.
IF I CAN GET BACK IN ANY WAY, I
AM A DONOR NOW MYSELF.
I AM HAPPY TO BE PART OF THAT
AND TO BE ABLE TO GIVE BACK AND
TO SEE OTHER STUDENTS THAT WILL
BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME
THING.
