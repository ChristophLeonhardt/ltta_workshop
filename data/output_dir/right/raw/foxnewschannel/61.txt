00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:04,119
>> Shannon: AT THE STATE TO

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:04,653
PARTNER, THANK YOU.

4
00:00:04,654 --> 00:00:07,289
IF THERE ARE REPORTS MAKE THAT

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,324
GINA HASPEL IS TRAVELING TO

6
00:00:09,325 --> 00:00:11,059
TURKEY AMID AN INTERNATIONAL

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,893
OUTCRY AFTER SAUDI ARABIA'S

8
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:14,196
EXPEDITION ABOUT THE DEATH OF

9
00:00:14,197 --> 00:00:15,564
JOURNALIST KHASHOGGI AND THE

10
00:00:15,565 --> 00:00:18,800
TURKISH PRESIDENT SAYS HIS

11
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:19,601
INVESTIGATION WILL REVEAL THE

12
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,235
NAKED TRUTH, POSSIBLY A

13
00:00:20,236 --> 00:00:23,672
DIFFERENT TRUTH.

14
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:24,306
TREASURY SECRETARY STEVEN

15
00:00:24,307 --> 00:00:25,674
MNUCHIN MEETS WITH THE SAUDI

16
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:26,942
CROWN PRINCE AS HE CONTINUES TO

17
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:29,177
DENY ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE

18
00:00:29,178 --> 00:00:29,678
KILLING.

19
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,879
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS HE IS NOT

20
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,214
SATISFIED BY WHAT HE HAS HEARD

21
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:35,050
FROM THE SAUDIS SO FAR.

22
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:36,485
>> I'M GOING TO KNOW VERY

23
00:00:36,486 --> 00:00:36,818
SHORTLY.

24
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:38,186
HAVE A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE IN

25
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:41,490
TURKEY RIGHT NOW AND A GREAT

26
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,892
GROUP OF PEOPLE IN SAUDI ARABIA

27
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:46,261
AND I WILL KNOW VERY SOON.

28
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,463
I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH WHAT I

29
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:48,797
HEARD.

30
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,532
>> Shannon: JOINING ME NOW,

31
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,334
FORMER CIA STATION CHIEF, DANIEL

32
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:53,101
HOFFMAN, ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU

33
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,736
WITH US.

34
00:00:54,737 --> 00:00:56,004
LET'S START WITH TURKEY BECAUSE

35
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:57,105
WE KNOW THE CIA DIRECTOR IS IN

36
00:00:57,106 --> 00:00:58,774
ROUTE, IF NOT ALREADY THERE.

37
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:02,644
HE SAID HE'S GOING TO PUBLICLY

38
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,146
LAY OUT WHAT THEY HAVE FOUND IN

39
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,080
THEIR INVESTIGATION SO FAR.

40
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:06,915
SO HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT SHE

41
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:07,716
IS THERE AS WELL?

42
00:01:07,717 --> 00:01:08,683
>> I THINK IT WAS A GREAT MOVE

43
00:01:08,684 --> 00:01:10,619
FOR HER TO TRAVEL TO TURKEY

44
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,221
BECAUSE THE ESSENCE OF WHAT THE

45
00:01:13,222 --> 00:01:14,723
PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SAY

46
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:16,091
TOMORROW IS BASED ON THE

47
00:01:16,092 --> 00:01:17,659
INTELLIGENCE THAT HIS SERVICE,

48
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,728
HIS INTELLIGENCE AND SERVICES

49
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:20,128
COLLECTED.

50
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:21,696
THE TECHNICAL SURVEILLANCE OF

51
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:22,531
THE CONSULATE, HUMAN

52
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:23,932
SURVEILLANCE IS REALLY THE

53
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:25,600
BASIS, THE EVIDENCE ON WHICH THE

54
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:26,701
WHOLE CASE RELIES AND I THINK

55
00:01:26,702 --> 00:01:28,770
THE DIRECTOR WILL BE THERE

56
00:01:28,771 --> 00:01:29,471
TOMORROW HERSELF FIRSTHAND TO

57
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:31,706
EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE AND TO

58
00:01:31,707 --> 00:01:33,308
ENGAGE WITH SENIOR TURKISH

59
00:01:33,309 --> 00:01:33,675
OFFICIALS.

60
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,109
>> Shannon:

61
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,876
"THE WASHINGTON POST" SAYS THIS,

62
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:36,912
THE CHIEF CONCERN FOR WASHINGTON

63
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:38,680
IS THAT THE TURKISH PRESIDENT

64
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,948
WILL REVEALED DETAILS ABOUT THE

65
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:42,484
KILLINGS THAT IMPLICATE CROWN

66
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:45,120
PRINCE THE CROWN       A KEY ALL

67
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:45,153
PRINCE THE CROWN       A KEY ALY

68
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:45,187
PRINCE THE CROWN       A KEY ALF

69
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:45,220
PRINCE THE CROWN       A KEY ALR

70
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:45,253
PRINCE THE CROWN       A KEY ALT

71
00:01:45,254 --> 00:01:45,487
PRINCE THE CROWN       A KEY ALE

72
00:01:45,488 --> 00:01:47,055
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

73
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:49,758
THEY ARE IN A TOUGH SPOT, BUT

74
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,659
THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID

75
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,660
REPEATEDLY WE ARE SENDING OUR

76
00:01:51,661 --> 00:01:54,162
TOP PEOPLE OVER THERE, WE KNOW

77
00:01:54,163 --> 00:01:55,564
THAT SECRETARY WHEN NGUYEN IS

78
00:01:55,565 --> 00:01:56,031
OVER THERE NOW.

79
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,632
HE SAYS WE WANT TO KNOW THE

80
00:01:57,633 --> 00:02:01,103
TRUTH.

81
00:02:01,104 --> 00:02:02,270
>> THAT IS THE KEY QUESTION, WHO

82
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,939
GAVE THE ORDER TO SEND THESE 15

83
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,709
SALARIES ON THE GULFSTREAM TO

84
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,410
ESSENTIALLY MURDER KHASHOGGI?

85
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:10,512
AND WERE THOSE ORDERS CARRIED

86
00:02:10,513 --> 00:02:11,179
OUT AS THEY WERE INTENDED?

87
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,348
WAS THE GUY WHO GAVE THE ORDER

88
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:15,350
THE CROWN PRINCE MIKE AND IF IT

89
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,154
WAS THAT IS GOING TO HAVE

90
00:02:19,155 --> 00:02:20,722
SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS.

91
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:21,790
TOMORROW BEGINS THE SAUDI

92
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:23,225
INVESTORS CONFERENCE AND NOBODY

93
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,726
IS SHOWING UP EXCEPT THE

94
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,895
RUSSIANS AND THE PAKISTANIS.

95
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,330
THAT REALLY DOESN'T AUGUR WELL

96
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:29,531
FOR THE PRINCESS SIGNATURE SALT

97
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:32,134
DOME OF POLICY, DESIGNED TO

98
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:32,834
DIVERSIFY THE SAUDI ECONOMY.

99
00:02:32,835 --> 00:02:33,735
IF THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE

100
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,337
SAUDIS ARE ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO

101
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:36,037
MAKE SOME IMPORTANT DECISIONS

102
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:37,839
ABOUT THEIR FUTURE.

103
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,107
>> Shannon: BRET BAIER THIS WE

104
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:40,242
CAN TALK WITH THE SAUDI FOREIGN

105
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,443
MINISTER AND HERE WAS HIS

106
00:02:41,444 --> 00:02:46,114
EXPLANATION ABOUT THIS MISSION.

107
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,682
>> THIS WAS AN OPERATION WHERE

108
00:02:47,683 --> 00:02:48,850
INDIVIDUALS ENDED UP EXCEEDING

109
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:49,384
THE AUTHORITIES AND

110
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:50,352
RESPONSIBILITIES THEY HAD.

111
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:53,922
THEY MADE THE MISTAKE WHEN THEY

112
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,823
KILLED HIM IN THE CONSULATE AND

113
00:02:54,824 --> 00:02:56,525
THEY TRY TO COVER UP FOR IT.

114
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:57,826
>> Shannon: HE DID GO ON TO

115
00:02:57,827 --> 00:02:59,194
REFER TO IT AS A CRIMINAL ACT.

116
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,663
HE SAID PEOPLE WILL BE HELD

117
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:03,331
RESPONSIBLE.

118
00:03:03,332 --> 00:03:04,065
WILL THERE BE DEFINITIVE ENOUGH

119
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,800
FINDINGS TO TELL US WHETHER OR

120
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,701
NOT THE CROWN PRINCE WAS

121
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:08,737
DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN GIVING

122
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:09,304
ORDERS?

123
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,472
>> AGAIN, I THINK THAT'S THE

124
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,039
PENULTIMATE QUESTION.

125
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,275
I WOULD BE HESITANT TO OFFER A

126
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,276
GUESS ABOUT WHETHER I THINK THE

127
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,545
EVIDENCE IS GOING TO PROVE THAT

128
00:03:16,546 --> 00:03:19,080
OR NOT, BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS

129
00:03:19,081 --> 00:03:19,814
THAT OUR INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY

130
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:21,716
ALREADY KNOWS A WHOLE LOT.

131
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,486
AND RIGHT NOW THE TURKS ARE OUT

132
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,720
FRONT SAYING WHAT THEY'VE GOT

133
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,688
WITH THE EVIDENCE, WE WILL HEAR

134
00:03:26,689 --> 00:03:28,123
MORE TOMORROW.

135
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,024
BUT I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE

136
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:32,127
A LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND ONE OF

137
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:32,894
THE REASONS WHY SECRETARY POMPEO

138
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:35,063
FLEW TO RIYADH AND PRESSED THE

139
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,498
SAUDIS I THINK PARTLY WAS

140
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:37,933
BECAUSE WE KIND OF KNOW A LOT

141
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:38,934
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND WE ARE

142
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:40,936
TRYING TO GET THEM TO DO THE

143
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:41,703
RIGHT THING WITH SOME

144
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:42,137
TRANSPARENCY.

145
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,139
WE KNOW THAT AT THE BEGINNING

146
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,373
THEY HAD SAID THAT KHASHOGGI

147
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,041
SIMPLY WALKED OUT OF THE

148
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:49,711
CONSULATE, WHICH WASN'T TRUE.

149
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:51,746
AND THEN THIS ODD DESCRIPTION OF

150
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:53,348
A BRAWL WHICH ELECTED WITH ONE

151
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:55,150
GUY AGAINST 15.

152
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,551
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF TRUTH TO

153
00:03:56,552 --> 00:03:56,985
GET TO HEAR.

154
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,053
>> Shannon: I WANT TO QUICKLY

155
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,821
ASK YOU BEFORE WE GO ABOUT

156
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,256
RUSSIA, THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION

157
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:02,724
TO PULL OUT OF THE INF TREATY.

158
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:03,892
HE SAYS WE ARE GOING TO BUILD UP

159
00:04:03,893 --> 00:04:05,126
OUR NUKES UNTIL THEY COME TO

160
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,361
THEIR SENSES, WE'RE JUST GOING

161
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:07,462
TO KEEP DOING IT SO NOBODY CAN

162
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:09,130
CHALLENGE US.

163
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:10,665
>> THIS IS A GOOD BIT OF KREMLIN

164
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,134
THEATER GOING BACK TO 2007,

165
00:04:13,135 --> 00:04:13,802
VLADIMIR PUTIN SAID THE INF

166
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:15,670
TREATY WASN'T VERY GOOD FOR

167
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,304
RUSSIA.

168
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:17,606
HE NEEDS INTERMEDIATE RANGE

169
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:18,573
NUCLEAR FORCES TO DEAL WITH

170
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:21,109
EUROPE AND TO DEAL WITH CHINA AS

171
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,077
WELL.

172
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:26,081
HE'S GOT THE SS 25.

173
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:28,116
ABSOLUTELY VIOLATED THIS TREATY

174
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:29,985
BUT HE'S TRYING TO PORTRAY IT AS

175
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,019
IF THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONE

176
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,322
NOT ADHERING TO THE TREATY.

177
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:36,091
RUSSIA LIKES TO SAY THAT WE ARE

178
00:04:36,092 --> 00:04:37,692
COMMITTED, THAT RUSSIA IS

179
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:38,994
COMMITTED TO A MULTIPOLAR WORLD

180
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:39,761
IN THE UNITED STATES WE NEED TO

181
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:40,495
DEAL WITH.

182
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,963
NOTHING CAN BE FARTHER FROM THE

183
00:04:41,964 --> 00:04:42,297
TRUTH.

184
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:43,031
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE

185
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,699
AMBASSADOR BOLTON GO OUT AND

186
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,867
GIVE ONE OF HIS PRESS

187
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,903
CONFERENCES FROM MOSCOW WHERE HE

188
00:04:48,904 --> 00:00:00,000
HOLDS THE RUSSIANS ACCOUNTABLE.
