1
00:00:02,746 --> 00:00:03,112
DANA?

2
00:00:03,113 --> 00:00:04,180
>> Dana: THANK YOU.

3
00:00:04,181 --> 00:00:05,681
JOINING ME FOR MORE ON THIS,

4
00:00:05,682 --> 00:00:08,284
MATT BENNETT, CO-FOUNDER OF

5
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:09,986
THIRD WAY, AND FORMER CONGRESS

6
00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:11,354
WOMAN FROM NEW YORK ON THE BOARD

7
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:13,155
OF DIRECTORS OF THE INDEPENDENT

8
00:00:13,156 --> 00:00:14,190
WOMEN'S FORUM.

9
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:16,759
MATT, I WANTED TO READ TO YOU A

10
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:22,365
TWEET THAT I SAW FROM THE OBAMA

11
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,267
COMMUNICATIONS.

12
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:27,069
HE SAID ARGUE ALL YOU WANT.

13
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,638
WHY DO IT BEFORE A RACE?

14
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:32,008
WHY DID SENATOR WARREN HAVE TO

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,010
DO HER ANNOUNCEMENT NOW?

16
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:36,279
WHY CAN'T DEMS EVER STAY

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:36,612
FOCUSED?

18
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:37,613
THREE QUESTION MARKS?

19
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:39,582
>> I THINK YOU RAISE A FAIR

20
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,216
POINT.

21
00:00:40,217 --> 00:00:41,884
IT'S CLEAR SENATOR WARREN WAS

22
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:44,787
RIGHT ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

23
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:46,188
PROBABLY WILL MEAN THE RACIST

24
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:47,523
SLUR THE PRESIDENT'S BEEN USING

25
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:49,358
TO DESCRIBE HER LOSES SOME OF

26
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:50,493
ITS PUNCH.

27
00:00:50,494 --> 00:00:53,129
BUT I DO WISH SHE HAD WAITED A

28
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,429
MONTH.

29
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,665
THIS IS A BIG MID TERM COMING

30
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:56,098
UP.

31
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,935
>> Dana: IT IS A HUGE MIDTERMS.

32
00:00:58,936 --> 00:00:59,902
THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE NOTHING

33
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,971
MORE THAN TALK ABOUT THIS.

34
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:05,241
IF SHE IS 1/1024 NATIVE

35
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:08,444
AMERICAN, DID SHE BENEFIT FROM

36
00:01:08,445 --> 00:01:09,879
PUTTING HER HERITAGE ON THESE

37
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,381
FORMS AND THEN IDENTIFYING THAT

38
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:12,648
WAY?

39
00:01:12,649 --> 00:01:14,317
>> SHE MUST BE NOTED THAT SHE

40
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:17,086
PUT HER HERITAGE CLAIM ON THE

41
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:20,156
FORMS ON THE BASIS OF FAMILY

42
00:01:20,157 --> 00:01:20,623
LORE.

43
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:22,191
AND TO HER GREAT RELIEF NOW, SHE

44
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:25,861
HAS FOUND THAT SHE IS, IN FACT,

45
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:27,430
1/1000, THAT'S THE ACTUAL

46
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:29,031
FIGURE, I GUESS, NATIVE

47
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:29,398
AMERICAN.

48
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:31,200
THAT IS LESS THAN THE AVERAGE

49
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:34,303
AMONG AMERICANS INTERESTINGLY

50
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,171
ENOUGH.

51
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:37,740
SHE'S LIKE .09%.

52
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:40,810
ON AVERAGE, AMERICANS ARE 1.4%.

53
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:43,746
ASIDE FROM ALL OF THAT, INDEED I

54
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:44,880
WOULD SAY THE PRESIDENT WAS

55
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:46,916
POKING FUN AT HER NOT IN A

56
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:50,853
RACIST WAY, BUT IN A JOVIAL WAY.

57
00:01:50,854 --> 00:01:54,924
>> Dana: THE LEFT TAKES IT THAT

58
00:01:54,925 --> 00:01:55,191
WAY.

59
00:01:55,192 --> 00:01:57,593
>> NATIVE AMERICANS TAKE IT THAT

60
00:01:57,594 --> 00:01:57,960
WAY.

61
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:58,828
DON'T BELIEVE ME.

62
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:00,763
ASK NATIVE AMERICANS WHAT THEY

63
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:01,864
THINK ABOUT THIS --

64
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:02,932
>> Dana: MATT.

65
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:05,568
>> WHAT THE PRESIDENT HAS DONE

66
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:11,107
IS CALLED HER BY A RACIST AND

67
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:12,708
OBNOXIOUS TERM AND HE'S BEEN

68
00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:14,877
ASKED NOT TO DO IT BY NATIVE

69
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:16,412
AMERICANS AND KEEPS DOING IT.

70
00:02:16,413 --> 00:02:18,781
>> I THINK NATIVE AMERICANS

71
00:02:18,782 --> 00:02:22,151
WOULD BE MORE OFFENDED BY

72
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,219
SOMEONE SAYING THEY ARE NATIVE

73
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:23,919
AMERICAN.

74
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,054
ELIZABETH WARREN WOULD BE A

75
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:26,288
DISASTER FOR THE UNITED STATES.

76
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:29,125
SHE IS IN FAVOR OF BRINGING BACK

77
00:02:29,126 --> 00:02:29,525
--

78
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:32,762
>> Dana: WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT

79
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:33,095
THAT?

80
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:36,232
THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS FOR THE

81
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:38,234
DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE INVESTED A

82
00:02:38,235 --> 00:02:38,501
LOT.

83
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:40,936
THEY HAVE RECRUITMENT UP,

84
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:41,570
ENTHUSIASM UP.

85
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:43,906
BUT 2020, IT'S RIGHT AROUND THE

86
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:44,240
CORNER.

87
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:47,843
THERE'S A POLL FROM CNN THAT

88
00:02:47,844 --> 00:02:48,811
TOOK THESE THREE PEOPLE.

89
00:02:48,812 --> 00:02:50,546
I THINK WE HAVE THEIR

90
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:51,380
PERCENTAGES THERE.

91
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:53,315
MATT, DO YOU THINK JOE BIDEN AT

92
00:02:53,316 --> 00:02:54,850
33%, THAT IS MOSTLY AT THIS

93
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:56,218
POINT A NAME I.D.?

94
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,055
>> I THINK IT'S ALMOST ENTIRELY

95
00:02:59,056 --> 00:02:59,355
THAT.

96
00:02:59,356 --> 00:03:01,924
WE HAVE A BIG FIELD, AS YOU'VE

97
00:03:01,925 --> 00:03:04,026
DISCUSSED MANY TIMES ON THIS

98
00:03:04,027 --> 00:03:04,326
SHOW.

99
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:06,128
MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE NO ONE'S

100
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:07,830
EVER HEARD OF OUTSIDE OF YOUR

101
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:09,131
OWN STATE DISTRICTS.

102
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:12,201
JOE BIDEN HAS 100% NAME I.D.

103
00:03:12,202 --> 00:03:13,602
>> Dana: THE DAY AFTER THE

104
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:15,037
MIDTERM, DEMOCRATS ARE ALL GONNA

105
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:16,505
START TO RUN AND THEY COULD HAVE

106
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,007
TWICE THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES

107
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,443
RUNNING THAN THE REPUBLICANS DID

108
00:03:20,444 --> 00:03:21,310
IN 2016.

109
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,911
>> RIGHT.

110
00:03:21,912 --> 00:03:24,013
WELL, DANA, IT'S TWICE AS MANY

111
00:03:24,014 --> 00:03:25,781
CANDIDATES ALL RUNNING ON THE

112
00:03:25,782 --> 00:03:27,450
WRONG PLATFORM FOR THIS COUNTRY.

113
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:30,086
SO I THINK THE PRESIDENT WILL

114
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,788
HAVE A LOT OF FUN POKING HOLES

115
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:34,690
IN THEIR ARGUMENTS AND, YOU

116
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:36,258
KNOW, LET'S FACE IT.

117
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:37,493
EVERY ONE OF THOSE CANDIDATES

118
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:39,795
HAS AN ACHILLES HEEL.

119
00:03:39,796 --> 00:03:41,597
>> Dana: DO WANT TO ASK YOU

120
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,666
ABOUT THE TEXAS RACE BETWEEN

121
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,234
BETO O'ROURKE AND TED CRUZ.

122
00:03:45,235 --> 00:03:46,969
WE'VE BEEN READING FOR MONTHS

123
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,938
VERY GLOWING FEATURE STORY OF

124
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,606
BETO O'ROURKE.

125
00:03:50,607 --> 00:03:52,875
HE HAS RAISED $38 MILLION.

126
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:54,810
THE LATEST POLL SHOWS HE'S DOWN

127
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,046
FROM TED CRUZ AT 54%, O'ROURKE

128
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:59,348
AT 45% GOING INTO MIDTERMS.

129
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:01,250
THERE WERE QUESTIONS OVER THE

130
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:02,451
WEEKEND FROM SOME DEMOCRATS

131
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,788
SAYING SHOULD BETO O'ROURKE,

132
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:07,556
SHOULD HE SHARE SOME OF THAT $38

133
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:09,125
MILLION WITH OTHER DEMOCRATS

134
00:04:09,126 --> 00:04:11,193
GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS?

135
00:04:11,194 --> 00:04:13,429
>> I THINK IT'S HARD TO DO, TO

136
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,530
ASK SOMEBODY WHO IS IN THE HEAT

137
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:16,465
OF BATTLE TO GIVE AWAY MONEY

138
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,501
THAT'S BEEN DONATED TO HIM.

139
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:20,603
THOSE DONORS EXPECT IT TO BE

140
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,371
USED IN HIS RACE.

141
00:04:22,372 --> 00:04:23,939
STATES LIKE TEXAS ARE FOOL'S

142
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,041
GOLD FOR THE OTHER SIDE UNTIL

143
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,109
THEY'RE NOT.

144
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:27,409
RIGHT?

145
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,878
PENNSYLVANIA WAS ALWAYS THAT WAY

146
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,112
FOR REPUBLICANS.

147
00:04:30,113 --> 00:04:33,549
FOR CYCLE AFTER CYCLE,

148
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,383
REPUBLICANS INVEST IN

149
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:34,817
PENNSYLVANIA.

150
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:36,051
>> Dana: MICHIGAN, TOO.

151
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:37,586
>> THEN THE WALL CRUMBLED.

152
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:39,388
THAT COULD HAPPEN IN TEXAS.

153
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:40,256
WE DON'T KNOW.

154
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:41,957
NEITHER DOES BETO.

155
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,926
>> Dana: LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT

156
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:45,094
TENNESSEE.

157
00:04:45,095 --> 00:04:46,529
BLACKBURN PULLING AWAY.

158
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,000
NEW YORK TIMES POLL 54, 45

159
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:51,333
PERCENT.

160
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,271
PHIL BREDESEN TRYING TO RUN AS A

161
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:55,638
MODERATE.

162
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,273
IF YOU CANNOT WIN THERE IN

163
00:04:57,274 --> 00:04:58,941
TENNESSEE, CAN YOU NOT WIN AT

164
00:04:58,942 --> 00:04:59,208
ALL?

165
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:01,644
>> MARSHA BLACKBURN HAS BEEN A

166
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,012
GREAT REPRESENTATIVE FOR

167
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:03,412
TENNESSEE.

168
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:07,049
SHE'S BEEN A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR

169
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,919
THE MUSIC INDUSTRY.

170
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,254
AND FOR TAXPAYERS AND FOR JOBS

171
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:13,088
AND WAGES.

172
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,257
SHE HAS EVERY ARGUMENT ON HER

173
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:15,591
SIDE.

174
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:18,627
GOVERNOR DREDESEN, FORMER

175
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:21,030
GOVERNOR BREDESEN, THERE'S

176
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:23,098
REPORTS THAT HE HELPED SOME KEY

177
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,501
AIDES AVOID PUBLIC RELEASE OF

178
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:27,603
DOCUMENTS RELATING TO THEIR OWN

179
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:29,471
SEXUAL HARASSMENT PROBLEMS.

180
00:05:29,472 --> 00:05:31,740
IN A ME TOO ERA, YOU KNOW, THAT

181
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:33,843
KIND OF THING DOES NOT SIT WELL.

182
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:35,077
>> Dana: I SHOULD POINT OUT

183
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,378
THERE IS ANOTHER POLL WHERE HE

184
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:37,947
IS ONLY DOWN BY ONE.

185
00:05:37,948 --> 00:00:00,000
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A DONE DEAL
