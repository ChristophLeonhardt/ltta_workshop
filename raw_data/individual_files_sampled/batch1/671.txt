Zann Raad al-hussein has been the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights since 2014 in those four years the attacks on people's safety and dignity seem to have reached into all corners of the world Myanmar's campaign to drive hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya out of the country the abuse and denial of asylum heaped on migrants fleeing war and economic deprivation the carnage left behind in the civil wars in Yemen and in Syria as well as in those parts of Syria and Iraq once controlled by ISIL one would think Zaid calls on countries to do better would have been welcomed but the High Commissioner has been criticized for pointing out where countries have failed to preserve human rights we discuss why human rights are under more pressure than ever and what should be done to protect them Wednesday's Raad al-hussein talks to al-jazeera thank you for talking to Al Jazeera thank you so much we're coming up on the end of your tenure and I wanted to ask you first just to get this out of the way you didn't ask for a second term you didn't think you would get the backing of the permanent five members of the UN Security Council and the thinking is Al Hussein is just too vocal Zaid speaks his mind too much he's not diplomatic enough why not get the p5 on the record and say we needed someone who wasn't going to be so forward leaning on trying to get the world to respect human rights it's a good question I never really assumed when I took this job that I would need to supplicate or need to prostate and prostrate myself before governments because the office itself yes it's a part of the UN but it's also part of a broader human rights movement and the job of High Commissioner is to be effectively the ambassador of human rights what does that mean it means that you have human rights law and you have obligations upon States to abide by the law and where they don't do so you have to then defend the victims who either are deprived of their rights or they're discriminated against when it comes to their rights or they live in fear and so my job was not to defend governments they can do that themselves my job was to defend and together with my office which I'm very proud to defend to defend the rights of everyone else individuals and and in that sense I knew early on that I'm not going to have the backing for of the permanent members of the Security Council in actual fact I would be concerned if I was on the outside and I saw that a High Commissioner had won support of the p5 because I would suspect that they haven't done their job properly at all goes without saying that the permanent five enjoy privileged status here in New York by dint of the use of veto in the Security Council in Geneva they don't they're just one of 47 members on the Human Rights Council if they're serving on the Human Rights Council and and so and we in the human rights community look at their records in the same way we look at anyone else's records and I the assumption it's not just an assumption they don't like that so I knew it was going to be possible you raised eyebrows when you spoke at the refugees conference here a couple of years ago and you said we're here because we as a global community have failed yes people are so desperate that they're getting into rickety ships and paying thousands of Psalms there are two people who don't have their best welfare at heart yes and we're here because we haven't found the will to stop that from happening yes is that your biggest regret no it's an acknowledgement of failure and that's why we have these compacts if we were doing everything correctly there's no need for everyone to gather and meet and discuss I mean it has to be placed into perspective this the number of people's on the move globally sort of is in the range of about four maybe four point five percent so ninety five and a ninety five percent and above of people on this planet are static I mean they stay within their countries right so all this hysteria that we see this panic the the trending toward the more extreme demagoguery is as a result of the small percentage of people who are actually moving across the planet where does that xenophobia come from we see it here in the US we see it in Central Europe we see it in parts of southern Europe we see it in some parts of India where does that come from well it comes from the recognition by politicians that the tactic works whatever the ills in society whatever the miscues by previous governments the inability of previous governments or indeed present governments to cope with current circumstances well then you pinpoint the blame on a particular community that seems different that seems alien that is vying for jobs and you you turn the hatred on them this is an old device the sad part of it is that it works and people tend to out of fear adhere to it and the politicians know it but there is a cautionary note is that the cautionary tale to this and that is that the logical extension of it is a sour outcome if you get chauvinistic nationalism a bigotry they sort of racist on the current moving and it reaches a certain pitch traditionally when we look at the historical record it's not easy to suddenly dismantle it and what you tend to find is that conflict arises out of it because suddenly you're telling a people that they're no longer special that they no longer somehow are superior to others that we all endowed with the same rights that we all have those rights and need to be treated equally whether on the basis of gender ethnicity you know whatever the circumstances may be your thoughts on Michelle Bachelet coming in as your successor but I'm fortunate enough to know her personally and I count her as a friend we worked together when she was head of U and women and I couldn't be more delighted I think she has proven her credentials both as a leader within the UN and as a head of state of her own country and someone who an early part of her life was subject to coercive practices and torture you know you have a political leader of great substance and and and a real strong well so I couldn't be delighted and I'd be looking forward to the transition from me to to her when we discuss North Korea or DPRK it's all about Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions there seems to be absolutely no public discussion or urgency about its appalling human rights record what pressure can you bring in your final weeks on the job to remind people this isn't about just North Korea's military but the millions of people who have suffered under 3 liters yeah I would dispute that it's been forgotten I mean perhaps in the context of the the immediate discussions that would seem to be taking place it's not being mentioned but I don't think it's it's easy for anyone to forget given the severity of the human rights violations detailed in the Kirby commission's report but also by our office and that work is continuing and ongoing there is a fear though that if the negotiations were to mature that somehow these issues will be downgraded and that's that's a fear we have with respect to many conflicts that begin to wind down and during the conflict there's a strong call for accountability that the perpetrators would be punished and as we work our way through the peace agreements and then when people say not now not now we leave it till you know a few years when it's cooled down a bit what we find though is that later it becomes even more difficult and and you cannot the victims need to feel that they're at the center of these negotiations that their pain is being attenuated and if you don't do that then it becomes problematic so we'll watch the DPRK file closely and I'm sure my successful successful will and if we see that it's be it's basically being pushed off the table certainly we're going to be speaking about it when we speak about you quite regularly do you fear that even though he has the legal right to do so that Kim jong-eun could be addressing the General Assembly in September but I don't know I mean that I don't know I mean you asked me a question and I haven't really given much thought about it I mean the position but does it create the wrong impression that he's been well I think I think I mean clearly there it would raise a lot of eyebrows and I mean the position of the UN as I understand it is that if you're indicted by an international court for the atrocity crimes crimes against humanity war crimes crimes again and the crime of genocide then it would be it would really be impermissible for you to to turn up in New York but if there hasn't been a charge like that it's it's it's the evidence is still being collected although there's very strong indications that the most severe human rights conditions exist I certainly there would be a lot of criticism of the UN and I as High Commissioner or annex High Commissioner wouldn't feel comfortable with it yeah when you talk about technicalities that's certainly been the case in recent developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo jean-pierre Bemba out of prison has filed his papers to run for president he was convicted of war crimes in the Central African Republic what happened here how did we get to this point well I haven't read the judgment of the the appellate judgment of the ICC sir in one way I don't want to go into it because I need to read the judgment right and then understand and and certainly there were those within the international criminal law community who had their own feelings about the decision but I would need to read it myself and then form an opinion so it would be premature for me to say anything about it but you can understand of course you know the communities in the Sierra but not maybe limited there even within the DRC you would see it as an odd decision by the appellate body on the other hand you know throughout legal systems in the world across the world we have decisions by courts that often arouse reaction strong reactions it's not to say that system has failed but the system it gives an interpretation which seems could seem to be at odds with the jurisprudence that was generated hitherto I I need to look at the actual details before commenting on that but isn't this a case that we're not talking about a sovereign government's justice system we're talking about something that was set up and agreed to by the international community and that all of the talk when he was convicted a decade ago of its validity of it acquiring a real sense of dealing with these sorts of atrocities may now have been undermined whether you you you if this is an aberration if this is an aberrant decision the the you know it will reset itself when we've seen this before in terms of other other decisions taken by international courts or tribunals the the the question is is it an aberration or not and I have to read the decision and clearly the you know the judges felt that they had had come up with a decision which they you know warranted the acquittal of jean-pierre Bemba and and I do need to see the decision before committee though it would be a really improper for me to say something and then and you'll ask me another question and I Turner what they actually said in terms of the reason I put forward so I do need to see that Syria yes there seems to be a growing consensus that bashar al-assad is winning the war has he gotten away with war crimes well I you know the at the moment we have an accountability mechanism it's collecting evidence it's continuing to collect evidence I the evidence has also been directed toward it from the commission of inquiry that's still operating one would believe that there would be a strong push for accountability for truth-telling that too many victims too many people have suffered in this cruel war to just let it pass to have it somehow forgotten and I would believe that there will be a time of reckoning for the president for his senior leadership and for others who are thought to have committed the most ghastly crimes in in Syria where does that reckoning happen well no it's a reckoning before the victims before a court I mean we saw at the end of last year a number of things happen where those who had perpetrated crimes many years ago must have thought they got away with it and for a while they did but then in the end Ratko Mladic was convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia there were two former Argentine officers who were convicted for their role in the dirty war the so-called dirty war many years ago there was a Salvadorian colonel who was extradited from the US to Spain to face potentially charges on account of an alleged involvement with the killing of a Jesuit priests and El Salvador in 1989 in other words they're activists lawyers journalists the world over who are collecting evidence preparing evidence and and people may who have been complicit in the commission of war crimes and and certainly if they were the sort of intellectual author may at some stage above that they may they've got away with it and they had been doing in any case something they believed was heroic and patriotic and perhaps it began to dawn on them later that maybe not so that maybe these are crimes against humanity war crimes and and then time caught up with them so you know it's yes there's a thirst and demand and need by certainly victims groups to see someone who they believe has created so much suffering you know held to account in a court of law but it sometimes takes it longer and sometimes painfully long time to get there but eventually I would hope in a context like Syria that there will be justice for the victims Israel Palestine the passage of the nation state law in Jerusalem is it understandable is it problematic now I said before and publicly it's clear that it's discriminatory and I don't see how else you could package an argument which makes sense to the that's it you know any objective observation of all of this and and that's how we see it as an office it's it seems to be a discriminatory law so what happens if you're an Israeli and you're not also Jewish you feel that the law would be discriminating against you and it's clear and there was an it's been a reaction by various leaders of the Druze community and the Arab Israeli community of course has made its views known as well no and it's and you know you in human rights terms again to achieve any sort of stability tranquility three conditions need to obtain one is that you don't discriminate about against people in your own country on the basis of race ethnicity color gender and so forth to that you don't deprive parts of your community subject to those discrimination from the largest of the state and keep them sort of without protectionist social protections three but you don't have people live in fear in your country and you have to remove that sense of fear and and instill within them a respect for institutions of trust in institutions well basically they feel they'll be treated fairly and if they feel they'll be treated fairly then there's little basis for them maintaining a sort of fearful state and so when you don't do those things then of course you you create tensions within society and feared that it's played on not everyone it's sad to see you go I'm sure know the Israeli ambassador down II dunno and sent out a statement saying this and I quote during his tenure the HRC became a theater of the absurd the Human Rights Council with hypocrisy and double standards rampant among its proceedings and reports well look the Ambassador I don't know the Ambassador to be honest I mean he's never come to Geneva I find it sort of quite strange that he talks of human rights when I assume that he knows very little about it I'm not the president of the Human Rights Council so for one it's a sort of conflate the Tories with nonsense but he said some other things about me I mean I don't take him seriously because again he's not a human rights person I've known many Israeli ambassadors worked with them and they seem to be in a serious about these issues this ambassador he's never come to Geneva will never discuss these issues so I I don't take much or attach much importance to what he says the well-being of women activists Saudi Arabia have they been forgotten well I don't know if they've been forgotten yes and and we are concerned I mean any time when you have a number of activists arrested we worry about whether it be an arbitrary arrests on direction of policy at the direction of policy and so I'm sure my office has opened up the channels and we want to understand what led to this exactly why has it flared up and we would all naturally want to see their earliest possible release and certainly if they're near charges they should be released immediately and even if there were charges we need to understand what exactly they've been charged with are there other places around the world that you don't think get enough attention because of how their citizens are faring or are not faring I've had some people talk about the situation in Nicaragua as one example yeah I mean again if it's whether we in our office are missing things I tend to think generally we do a good job I mean there may be certain things that we don't see immediately and then we're alerted to buy a specific NGO a specific group that will say you know you need to look at this because it's really becoming dangerous and we will we will certainly do that Nicaragua is a country I'm very worried about because as they conduct these sweeps and they're arresting detaining young activists who were associated with the protests we need to be assured that these people are not being harmed and are very concerned about the possibility of disappearances and forced disappearances and potentially of course torture that and all of this we need to understand what is going on so I'm I'm talking to others I've been in touch with people in this country I talked to the Europeans and need to talk to the OAS and the ICC but we need to all keep a very close eye on Nicaragua because I very much fear for the stability of the state if the current government's policies are are continued and there is no accountability for what we saw as and it was horrific violence by state actors and by the paramilitary forces involved you're stepping away at a rather contentious moment for the world yeah what do you do now yeah I need to I need to spend time with my my family I have been away from them for four years and so I have to reintroduce myself to them and a little bit of a rest and then I'll pick up again or not I'll find something not too distant from the work that I've been doing that's fun so people have not heard the last of you I I don't think so but I may need the rest before I pick it up again who do you see coming behind you who's in the next generation of human rights advocates when I sit with young people who lead protest movements who are courageous are willing to give everything up and who are very reasoned I they understand the dangers they understand what could potentially happen to them and yet they would still do it that is real leadership for me and much more so than many politicians for masquerade as leaders you know very concerned about you know protocol issues whether the first speaker at a particular conference how they whether they're entitled with excellencies and I don't know what I find many of them are just frauds really they're not they're not serious the serious people are the young human rights defenders who who stake everything on a counter principle I think there's an incredible leadership there mainly unsung many of them not really known but they are there and they're the hope of humanity rating sacred all the same High Commissioner for Human Rights thanks so much for talking to us on al Jazeera thank you so much you
