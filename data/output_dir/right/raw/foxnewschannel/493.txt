1
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:03,793
CHECK.

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:05,228
>> I THINK WHAT JEFF IS

3
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:06,863
SAYING WELL, ONE, YOU CAN

4
00:00:06,863 --> 00:00:08,264
HAVE THE FBI AND THE CIA AND

5
00:00:08,264 --> 00:00:09,399
THE FOREIGN LEGION AND

6
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:10,567
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TELL

7
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,068
YOU ANY MORE THAN YOU KNOW

8
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:12,335
NOW.

9
00:00:12,335 --> 00:00:13,570
THAT'S MY VIEW BUT WE WILL

10
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,504
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

11
00:00:14,504 --> 00:00:16,539
>> HE SAID HE IS -- A WEEK

12
00:00:16,539 --> 00:00:18,241
IS ENOUGH FOR HIM OR MAYBE

13
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:18,608
LESS.

14
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:19,776
SO WE ARE NOT PLAYING THIS

15
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:21,177
GAME OF OPENING THIS UP AND

16
00:00:21,177 --> 00:00:22,746
IT GOES ON FOREVER.

17
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:25,181
WHAT HE SAID WAS THAT I

18
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:26,516
WOULD FEEL BETTER IF THEY

19
00:00:26,516 --> 00:00:28,551
HAD A WEEK TO LOOK AT WHAT'S

20
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:30,754
IN FRONT OF US, NO MORE.

21
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:31,988
SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID

22
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:33,990
OKAY WITH THAT.

23
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,924
NOW, I WOULD LIKE THEM TO

24
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:35,825
COME FORWARD.

25
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:37,494
I'M GOING TO TALK TO MITCH

26
00:00:37,494 --> 00:00:39,262
AND JEFF AND EVENTUALLY

27
00:00:39,262 --> 00:00:40,430
ENGAGE WITH THE WHITE HOUSE.

28
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,898
AGAIN, I DON'T THINK WE NEED

29
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:42,199
THIS.

30
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:44,067
I AM LONG SENSE READY TO

31
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:44,368
VOTE.

32
00:00:44,368 --> 00:00:45,736
I THINK HE HAS BEEN VERY

33
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:49,172
POORLY TREATED.

34
00:00:49,172 --> 00:00:50,274
JUDGE KAVANAUGH.

35
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:51,441
>> DO YOU THINK THIS IS

36
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:56,847
GOING TO SAVE JUDGE -- SINK JUDE

37
00:00:56,847 --> 00:00:57,447
KAVANAUGH'S NOMINATION

38
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,782
RECOMMENDATION I THINK JEFF

39
00:00:58,782 --> 00:00:59,383
FEELS GOOD ABOUT JUDGE

40
00:00:59,383 --> 00:00:59,750
KAVANAUGH.

41
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,917
HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE

42
00:01:00,917 --> 00:01:01,618
PROCESS IS FAIR.

43
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:02,653
YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM.

44
00:01:02,653 --> 00:01:03,720
I HAVE NEVER FELT BETTER

45
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,322
THAN HIM BEING ON THE BENCH

46
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:05,922
THAN I DO RIGHT NOW.

47
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,291
>> SENATOR GRAHAM.

48
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,992
FLAKE PUT OUT A STATEMENT

49
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:09,860
THIS MORNING SAYING HE WAS

50
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,362
GOING TO VOTE YES SO WHAT

51
00:01:12,362 --> 00:01:12,696
CHANGED.

52
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:13,530
>>THIS IS CALLED DEMOCRACY.

53
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,665
HE TALKED TO HIS COLLEAGUES

54
00:01:14,665 --> 00:01:15,832
AND THEY ARE GOING JEFF,

55
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:17,167
JEFF, PLEASE JUST GIVE US A

56
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:18,101
FEW MORE DAYS.

57
00:01:18,101 --> 00:01:19,503
JEFF IS A REALLY GOOD GUY.

58
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:21,071
I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

59
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:22,239
[LAUGHTER]

60
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,641
BUT, PLEASE, LET'S BE FAIR.

61
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:26,076
AND JEFF IS TRYING TO BE

62
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:26,510
FAIR.

63
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,744
I JUST DON'T SEE WE ARE

64
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:29,513
GOING TO BENEFIT FROM

65
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,681
ANYTHING IN TERMS OF I HAVE

66
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:31,982
BEEN DOING THIS MOST OF MY

67
00:01:31,982 --> 00:01:32,816
ADULT LIFE.

68
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:34,084
35 YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW WHAT

69
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:35,218
YOU KNOW AND HAVE YOU HEARD

70
00:01:35,218 --> 00:01:36,420
WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR.

71
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,788
HAVING SAID THAT, THIS IS

72
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:38,655
CALLED DEMOCRACY.

73
00:01:38,655 --> 00:01:40,324
>> PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO

74
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:41,492
BELIEVE THAT BRETT KAVANAUGH

75
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:42,893
IS INNOCENT OF THINGS HE HAS

76
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:43,861
BEEN ACCUSED OF.

77
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,928
DO YOU THINK THIS MIGHT HELP

78
00:01:44,928 --> 00:01:46,463
OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY

79
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:47,898
FEEL BETTER ABOUT THIS

80
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:48,665
PERSON ON THE SUPREME COURT

81
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:50,100
IF A WEEK FROM NOW THE FBI

82
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,268
COMES BACK AND SAYS WE'RE

83
00:01:51,268 --> 00:01:51,568
GOOD.

84
00:01:51,568 --> 00:01:52,736
>> I THINK THE PEOPLE IN THE

85
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:53,937
COUNTRY ARE GOING TO FEEL

86
00:01:53,937 --> 00:01:55,105
DIFFERENT LAY WEEK FROM NOW

87
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:56,373
YOU CAN PROBABLY PUT IN A

88
00:01:56,373 --> 00:01:58,242
PHONE BOOTH.

89
00:01:58,242 --> 00:01:59,409
HOWEVER, IF JEFF FEELS

90
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:01,011
BETTER ABOUT IT, I FEEL

91
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:01,979
BETTER ABOUT IT.

92
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,516
>> I'M PRACTICAL GUY.

93
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:06,517
>> SENATOR GRAHAM, DO YOU

94
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:07,652
THINK HE WAS MOVED AFTER HE

95
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:08,886
WAS CON FRONTED BY

96
00:02:08,886 --> 00:02:10,187
PROTESTERS ON HIS WAY TO

97
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:11,188
VOTE THIS MORNING?

98
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:13,824
>> NO.

99
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:12,123
I MEAN, THIS IS WHY

100
00:02:12,123 --> 00:02:17,828
LISTEN, THIS IS JEFF FLAKE.

101
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:18,462
I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT I

102
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:19,664
ACTUALLY LIKE ABOUT THE GUY.

103
00:02:19,664 --> 00:02:20,931
SUSAN, ALL THESE PEOPLE TAKE

104
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:22,166
IT REALLY SERIOUSLY.

105
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,334
JEFF IS NOT A LAWYER.

106
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:24,135
THIS IS HARD.

107
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:24,835
AGAIN, I HAVE BEEN IN THE

108
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:25,436
LYLE SYSTEM.

109
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,837
YOU HAVE A LOT OF EMOTIONAL

110
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:28,939
DECISIONS TO MAKE BUT THE

111
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:30,474
FACT PATTERN HERE LENDS

112
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:31,776
ITSELF TO I'M SORRY THERE IS

113
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,177
NOT ENOUGH, WE HAVE GOT TO

114
00:02:33,177 --> 00:02:33,811
MOVE ON.

115
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,180
BUT, HAVING SAID THAT THIS

116
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,615
IS JEFF FLAKE BEING VERY

117
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,449
SINCERE AND WHAT HE IS

118
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,517
TRYING TO I DO RESPECT THE

119
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:40,985
HELL OUT OF, THIS TRYING TO

120
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:42,353
GET SOME DEMOCRATS TO BUY IN

121
00:02:42,353 --> 00:02:43,454
WILL A WEEK MATTER?

122
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,689
SOME OF THEM SAID IT, WOULD

123
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:45,990
SOME OF THEM WANT TO GO ON

124
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,059
AND ON AND ON.

125
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:49,694
AND SOME OF THEM SAY A WEEK

126
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:51,329
LONGER WOULD MAKE A BETTER

127
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:51,696
PROGRESS.

128
00:02:51,696 --> 00:02:52,863
>> DO YOU THINK THE

129
00:02:52,863 --> 00:00:00,000
REPUBLICANS WOULD AGREE TO
