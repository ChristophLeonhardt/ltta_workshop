i'm steve carnegie in for brian williams day 519 of the trump administration and tonight there's a new report that the Department of Health and Human Services is taking action to try to reunify families separated at the border Politico reporting that according to an internal document the Department of Health and Human Services has created a quote unaccompanied children reunification task force a first step toward reunifying thousands of migrant children in the agency's custody with their families earlier today a senior department of homeland security official confirmed to NBC that about five hundred children and parents have been reunited since May we saw one today a mother from Guatemala who was reunited in Maryland with her seven-year-old son they had been separated at the border a month ago as the administration attempts to deal with president Trump's executive order ending the separation policy he is also now firing back at his critics this afternoon at the White House president hosted families whose children have been killed allegedly by undocumented immigrants we're gathered today to hear directly from the American victims of illegal immigration you know you hear the other side you'd never hear this side you don't know what's going on these are the American citizens permanently separated from their loved ones they're not separated for a day or two days these are permanently separated because they were killed by criminal illegal aliens in just hours before that the president sent this out on Twitter quote we cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the des the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections Democrats have been getting out their message today on the House floor Democrat ted Lieu playing the audio recording first obtained by Pro Publica of crying migrant children separated from their families the gentleman will suspend for what reason madam Speaker the gentleman is in breach of forum sight the rule madam Speaker rule 17 of the house the gentleman will suspend you for use these are daddies is a detention facility why do you not let the American people hear what they are saying meanwhile Democratic senators Martin Heinrich Richard Blumenthal and Tom Udall were in Tornillo Texas to try to visit a detention facility where 250 migrant children are being held the Senators were denied access though I just think this is an administration that is completely afraid of transparency is afraid of the media I think it's an internment site with tents it's a prison white internment site also today lawmakers efforts to deal with the immigration crisis got something of a blow from the president who's been demanding that Congress take action earlier in the week Donald Trump met with House GOP leadership said he would support legislation this morning though the president tweeted this quote Republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen women in November Dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solve this decades-old problem we can pass great legislation after the red wave they have brought this reaction from Republicans on Capitol Hill I respectfully disagree I think we should continue to work on it I think what you've seen as president Trump expressing his frustration we need a red wave to get more Republicans who want to actually vote to secure our border it's going to have an incredible on the possibility of immigration moving forward I think we'll have a very constructive bill on the floor next week let's bring in our leadoff panel for this Friday night Franco or dounia's White House correspondent for McClatchy Newspapers covering immigration in foreign affairs the New York Times Kati Benner Pulitzer prize-winning reporter who covers the Justice Department and you me shall cinder White House correspondent for Newshour on PBS thanks to all of you for being with us and Katie let me start on you we have that reporting tonight about some movement on that issue of reunifying parents with children at least some of them you cover the Justice Department the legal end of this it sounded like there was still plenty of confusion when that executive order was issued the other day by the president about what that was actually going to allow in terms of reunification how clear is that now absolutely so as you say this was another self-inflicted wound by the Trump administration not thinking through clearly enough a directive before issuing it and so we saw a lot of confusion last night there was a meeting at the White House where people argued back and forth for at least 90 minutes about what to do things do seem to have clarified somewhat at the heart of this the Justice Department helped draft the executive order so they believe that their legal interpretation of this is correct which is based around what they are calling a zero-tolerance policy for people crossing the border legally and then other components including Border Patrol at DHS has pushed back and said we just don't think that we can do both we cannot keep families together and continue to do zero tolerance today it seems like we've got the components together and that they did come to somewhat more of a position where they're all in the same page cueing who more closely to zero tolerance and it seems that the President on this obviously especially after issuing that executive order trying to talk about other facets of the immigration issue maybe change the subject maybe throw more balls in there however you want to look at it let's look at those different components a Franco to you on the political component on Capitol Hill we had the president there a couple days ago talking to Republicans carrying the message of hey you know I'm with you get some immigration reform let's get this done then today going on Twitter and saying you know what Democrats are just getting in the way we can't do anything until after November anyway politically on Capitol Hill what were the odds of some action taking place on immigration between now and the election and what are the odds now after that tweet from Donald Trump I mean the odds were pretty low before it was a it was a heavy lift from the start that's why the moderate proposal was punted supposedly to the next week in the first place but then when Trump issued that tweet it really deflect the air out of any more energy I thought of all the members that spoke in that clip that you shared mark Sanford I thought was a South Carolina with the most honest and saying look it's gonna be really hard to do it now let's remember that Paul Ryan and other leaders at the beginning of this debate said they need Trump support they need his backing we don't want to bring anything to the floor unless we know for sure that this is something that he's going to support this obviously he's not going to support I think we're just hearing a lot of talk and trying to say this is supportive but this does not look like it's going to work and maybe that's maybe it's for the best you really for moderate Republicans this was going to be really tough to get done and Trump was walking kind of a tightrope here he didn't want to like go too hard and hurt moderate publics but if he didn't go hard enough he was going to hurt his base yeah and you meets the other piece of what Donald Trump was saying today on the issue of immigration had to do with that event with families there with family members who they say had been the victims of crimes as they committed by illegal immigrants this is something the president has talked about before as a candidate a couple times as president does seem striking that he's trying to do it today in the wake of of all the issues with children at the border you have been covering Trump and in the reaction from some of his supporters some of his some of his base how does something like what he's doing today kind of meshed with what his base is looking for well his base is looking for exactly what the president did today he took that message of America first and really made it something that was about whether or not you support these he asking the question really do you support migrant kids in cages or do you support families who whose loved ones have allegedly been killed by undocumented immigrants hee hee posed that question to his base they chose they choose America they choose this idea that you kill you but that you have to not look at these kids in cages and be appalled that you have to instead pivot and look at these families the fact that he continually said that these are families that are permanently separated from their loved ones making light of the fact that being separated from your child for a month or two months or even eight months in some cases that that's not as hard as your child being gone forever so there's this idea that he really wanted to to get back to his roots because you know this week was really really tough for the president he does not step back he does not take back his actions and this week he had to actually say you know what he had to admit it on paper in an executive order that he that this was something that could work out that he had to actually undo a policy that he thought was gonna deter to deter undocumented immigrants so I think that the president felt was feeling a little wounded and as a result he did this I talked to a White House official a couple hours ago who said that the president still supports both of the bills they're in the house but that person is saying that on background not wanting to put their name on the record and the president is not tweeting that out he's not saying hey I still am excited about these two bills I hope that they pass instead he's really saying you're wasting your time let's just make it a midterm issue yeah and that's the interesting thing you Misha I think it was Ryan Costello Republican congressman from Pennsylvania he's actually is not running again he he got a tough break there in the redistricting and said that's it I'm not going again and and he's been a little bit more outspoken maybe since then I his reaction to what you just said from from Donald Trump today was he said hey the calculation is clear here the president just wants to be blaming Democrats rhetorically on the see is there a strategy that you see there between now and November that's hey you know not about policy not about legislation about the rhetoric of the campaign I think so I think that this this president wants to say if you don't if you want strong stronger immigration laws if you want to actually get something done that you need to have more Republicans the White House official today talked to me and said that the Republicans don't have enough of a majority there's this idea of course that everyone knows that Republicans have control of both the the presidencies the house Senate but now they're saying we don't have enough Republicans to get things through and that we need to get even get rid of some more of these Democrats and and I think that that's been really important because the president also thinks also sees that Democrats were having a really tough time and are still having a really tough time getting a message together but kids in cages really grabbed the attention of this of the of the whole nation and even Republicans who have never really criticized the president came out and said this is wrong Paul Ryan all these other all these other Republicans on Capitol Hill evangelicals that are backing the president because of his stance on abortion and Neil gorgeous are on the Supreme Court they also said we cannot we cannot have this so the president needs to get this narratives back and the way he said he wants to do that is by making in a midterm issue hey there I'm Chris Hayes from MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos we're putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on
