investigation into Russia's interference

7
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,880
in the 2016 election the choice of

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,440
robert mueller for special counsel has

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,270
been met with unusual universal praise

10
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,949
from both sides of the aisle I think

11
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:21,810
he's a person of great integrity he'll

12
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,070
be above politics

13
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,220
you will not push them around completely

14
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,570
unimpeachable in all respects he will

15
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,099
investigate the matter and follow the

16
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,359
facts wherever they may lead from

prosecutor to unyielding FBI director

19
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,840
this is how robert mueller came to be

20
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,489
considered the least biased man in

21
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,210

40
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,750
rose quickly through the ranks as a

41
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,909
federal prosecutor as chief of the

42
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,320

stint in private practice but it wasn't

48

for him he quit his job as a very highly

capital that's the dedication that you

52
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,649
see there in 2001 President Bush

53
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,079
appointed Mueller to FBI director he is a

54
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,540
bit of a taskmaster he wanted to upgrade

55
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,520
the quality of the office was good it

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,049
wasn't Pleasant for everyone who was

57
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,850
there but it was something that needed

58
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,140
to be done

59
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,450
the FBI changed markedly under his

60
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,430
leadership exactly one week after

61
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,100
starting in 2001 the September 11th

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,110
attacks happened a lot of people you

63
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,330
came as being a very steady hand after

64
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,790
than unless attacks that's Chris Sturm

Bloomberg national security reporter

66
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,310
reshaping the FBI to become a

67
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,380
counterterrorism agency and also

68
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,990
building up the cyber security and at

69
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,340
the end of Mueller's 10-year tenure

70
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,260
President Obama moved for a special

nominated to run the FBI he was

73
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,890
unanimously approved by Congress it was

74
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,230
not all smooth sailing though mowers

75
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,790
principals were put to a significant

76
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,920
test in 2004 over president bush's

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,630
warrantless surveillance programs

78
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,820
secretly launched after September 11th

79
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,770
the secret surveillance program needed

80
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,680
to be reauthorized by this very general

81
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,920
who at that time was John Ashcroft and

82
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,510
Ashcroft would sit in the hospital

83
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,150
on the night of March 10th 2004 several

84
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,920
high-profile White House officials were

85
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,450
on their way to pressure Ashcroft to

86
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,550
sign papers extending the program when

87
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,590

coming hung up called director Muller

90
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,040
and told him what was happening he said

91
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,390
I'll meet you at the hospital right now

92
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,519
in a showdown at George Washington

93
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,130
Hospital baller and closes - its side by

94
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,980
side to prevent officials from the Bush

95
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,489
administration from trying to force

96
00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:21,870
astronauts to reauthorize the program

97
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,200
while laying in his hospital bed

98
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,670
threatening to resign molar and Comey

99
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,650
were able to get the program altered the

100
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,480
secret program looks likely wouldn't

101
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,549
have come out shadows if Mullen totally

102
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,799
did not take a stand against it mowers

103
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,330
long-standing relationship with Comey

104
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,980
has led to questions about whether he

105
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,420
can remain impartial in his current

106
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,970
investigation it's clear from his almost

107
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,950
forty years of public service that

108
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,320
Mueller is dedicated to the job it'd have

109
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,000
to be pretty much a dead end er to not

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,739
believe Bob Mueller while investigating allegations of

111
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,480
collusion between Trump and Russia may

112
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,100
be his toughest case yet can't think of

113
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,870
anybody who will be better than Mahler

114
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,030
due to the investigation he's had a

115
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,370
history of standing up to power he said

116
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,069
he's had

117
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:02,230
basing our president it's one of the

118
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,269
most important jobs of his life once

119
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,650
again he's answering a call to duty

120
00:04:08,010 --> 00:00:00,000
