this is intelligent investing presented by fidelity investments 2017 was a nearly unprecedented year for high returns for the sp500 with very little volatility in fact according to fidelity investments through November of last year the risk adjusted rate for the S&P 500 was in the 99th percentile since nineteen twenty six so statistically that should not happen very often and it's very unlikely that it will continue as the stock market dropped at the end of last weekend at the beginning of this week and as volatility doubled very early this week EURion tamara of global macro for fidelity says the reason for the sell-off seems simple enough the stock market has finally started paying attention to the bond market again he says interest rates are an important part of equity valuations as interest rates rise we are discounting more the future cash flows of stocks and giving them less credit for that timur says that bond yields have risen enough that now we can't ignore them anymore the 10-year yield is now double what it was and it's low in the summer of 2016 before the correction he says things were starting to look a lot like 1987 where stocks rallying wallah yields were rising in 1987 stocks rally at a 40% while bond yields also rallied 40 percent and of course leading to the giant sell-off that was referred to as Black Monday last week's correction ironically happened at the same time that consensus estimates for the S&P 500 earnings growth rose to over 20 percent which is way up from where it was in August at about 12% but timur says it's more logical than it seems because amid the euphoria of rising corporate earnings it's been clear that both the equity and bond markets were being too complacent about the other side of that trade tax cuts could push the economy toward the overheating phase if that happened the Fed would likely raise rates with implication for interest rates in general he says the silver lining is that the stock market is paying attention to the bond market again instead of ignoring it and suffering a much worse fate later on like it did in 1987 you
