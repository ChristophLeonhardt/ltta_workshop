pretty good evening and thanks very much for being with us tonight and I want to thank everybody who's here in the audience here in the nation's capitol because they are very brave souls they are here despite a rain storm winds we think are gonna be about 75 miles an hour and there's also talk of tornado other than that it's a beautiful evening here in the nation's capital so we thank you and I want to thank all of the folks so with us tonight on livestream and our media partners at the Guardian at Young Turks at the intercept the nation credo move on now this act TV and others who are streaming the event so we thank them all very much this is the third Town Meeting that we have done and the reason we do these town meetings is we think the American people are a little bit smarter than the corporate media thinks they are and we think the American people want to hear serious discussion about serious issues our first time meeting was on why the United States is the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a right and why we need Medicare for all our second Town Meeting dealt with the massive levels of income and wealth inequality that exists in this country today and what that means and tonight we're dealing again with an issue I think we as a nation do not discuss through anywhere near the degree that we should and that is foreign policy in general perhaps from a different perspective than you will see on often on cable TV and obviously what motivated this meeting tonight was a president Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and also we are more than mindful of the tragedy that now takes place in Gaza and we'll be discussing that as well I think in American politics there is not the full degree of understanding in terms of what the implications of foreign policy are about people are worried about health care and the word about education and climate change etc but foreign policy often seems a little bit distant so let me just say that if you are concerned about education and infrastructure in health care you know what you should be concerned about foreign policy because foreign policy has a lot to do with military policy and military policy has a lot to do with the expenditure of 700 billion dollars a year we are now spending as a nation more on our Department of Defense that I believe the next 10 nations combined at a time when our infrastructure is collapsing public schools are in desperate over 30 million people have no health insurance Congress voted to increase military spending by a hundred and sixty five billion dollars over a two year period so that brings the issue of foreign policy kind of back home in terms of our national priorities and the second issue in terms of foreign policy is that tragically sometimes it results in the loss of life for our brothers and our sisters and our neighbors in my opinion the war in Iraq was the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country and it cost us over 4400 American lives 31,000 many women who wounded came back without limbs or with PTSD it costs the people in Iraq some 500,000 lives displacement of some three million people a cost of two trillion dollars that is foreign policy so in terms of foreign policy it's important that we get it right it's important that we don't have that we understand what the unintended consequences of war sometimes we think it's going to turn out a certain way it often turns out a very very different way so with that let me begin the discussion tonight and introduce to you our panelists and we have really a really distinguished panel with with us Joan Jo this is hard I'm gonna get it syringe gionee how's that Joe all right Joe Cirincione is the president of the Ploughshares fund and organization that works to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons on my immediate right is Suzanne DiMaggio who was a senior fellow at new America where she focuses on u.s. foreign policy the Middle East in Asia are you have been to Iran a number of times as well as North Korea actually yes okay then we have with us Rob Malley and Rob was his president and CEO of International Crisis Group which does research on conflict areas around the world he was also a member of President Obama's National Security Council and was the director of their Middle East division as that curtain and finally we have lara friedman who was president of the foundation for Middle East peace which promotes a peaceful resolution to the israeli-palestinian conflict Joe let me begin with you with a kind of a question I think is on many people's minds and why is Trump's decision that withdraw from the nuclear deal with Iran such a problem and what are the likely repercussions of that decision thank you senator and thank you for holding this and spending time on this critical national security issue a president Trump's decision to violate the agreement was by far the most destructive act of his presidency he broke faith with our allies he dealt a crippling blow to the anti-nuclear efforts around the world he severely damaged American credibility but most seriously I think he's put us on a path towards war in the Middle East you may remember back in 2010 the talk in this town was when Israel was going to bomb Iran not if front-page the cover of the Atlantic magazine Jeffrey Goldberg's article and that was the view Benjamin Netanyahu wanted to bomb Iran he went to his security cabinet twice trying to get agreement to do that that's what motivated this diplomacy many many of us in the NGO world were working with people in the administration and trying to encourage them to start the diplomacy to find a diplomatic solution to this crisis we found it this was by far the strongest anti nuclear agreement in decades the crowning achievement of European diplomacy and President Trump has just trashed it without a plan B without any idea of what to do next some rhetoric some vows that we're going to go get a better deal but no better deal is in sight and without a diplomatic agreement without some without the unity of the international community that we helped convince Iran to come to the negotiating table the fear is whether Trump intends to or not he's going to get drawn into the already hot conflicts in the Middle East that Israel and Saudi Arabia are deeply involved in and they are trying to pulling him in him in and since he violated the deal these conflicts have intensified the violence in the Middle East has gotten worse not better Suz and your take on the implications of Trump's withdrawal from the agreement I think this is probably one of the most catastrophic decisions we'll see coming out of the Trump administration and I think that's saying a lot I just came from a meeting in Europe where I had a discussion with a very well-placed Iranian and he likened this move to the 1953 coup of the democratically elected prime minister of Iran a Mossadegh that's when the US and Britain overthrew this democratically elected government me interrupt you Suzanne and and do you think many people in America know that in 1953 the United States and Great Britain overthrew the democratically elected I don't think it's common knowledge senator but I think it's important to look at the us around relationship in in its full history and as you'll find there are lists a long list of grievances on both side this one I just mentioned and for him to compare it to that I think it really does demonstrate how much this has impacted the psychology of the Iranian people what the Saran deal don't forget they saw hope as a way to improve their economy join the global economy become more engaged with the West and I think the people of Iran really looked to this deal in a very positive way and with this careless reckless move Trump has just wiped that out when you travel to the Middle East I'm always struck when I travel to Iran the people of Iran actually look very kindly on Americans they don't like our policy but they sure like us as people and I'm afraid with Trump has done is one step towards losing the hearts and minds of the Iranian people and how they think of Americans let me ask Thank You Susan let me ask Rob a question our major allies remain in the agreement uh what impact does Trump's decision have on US relationships around the globe and with our major allies not a good one let me start by thanking you senator for organizing this I think it really is important on a decision this like this and an issue like this it's involving American people to involve their representatives because this is gonna have very widespread repercussions and as you said foreign policy is domestic policy but just let's put this in context again I think Joe made this point well the Trump administration with President Trump has done is walk away from an agreement that everyone's knows was working that's not in doubt nobody is claiming that Iran was cheating nobody's claiming that moving towards a nuclear weapon everyone from obviously I'm biased I helped negotiate the deal but forget me the IAEA the International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran was respecting the deal every country that signs this agreement said that Iran was respecting the deal even those that are harder line on Iran like France our white house our State Department our intelligence community our Pentagon everyone was saying that this deal was being respected so the only reason the only reason that President Trump decided to walk away is because it was a legacy of his predecessor and he wants to undo that legacy because it was a promise even though it was an ill-founded and an unsound promise he made his electorate and because he's surrounded by some people who believe that we should be in the in the business of changing the regime of Iran or at least pressuring them to the point where they might break so what does that mean to our relationship with other countries it means that they can't trust us anymore that means that we're now no longer on the same on the same page and if the idea is to have a policy towards Iran is gonna work there's no way the United States could do that on its own the only way that we reach the Iran deal was because we had the Europeans with us we had the Russians with us we had the Chinese with us right now we're alone maybe we have Israel we have a few Arab countries and we come back to that later but the rest of the world is united and so we have this situation today which is you know quite embarrassing of most of the world and Iran against the United States thank you very much Robert Lara you know a little bit about Israel and there's nothing Yahoo what is Israel's role in this the ending of this agreement and in their views about the future of a run Thank You senator I'd be very careful to say what Israel's role is I'm not inside the head of Bibi Netanyahu and I'm not inside the decision making what I can evaluate are the facts as they are as we see them I think it's worth recalling that the path to the jcpoa for those of us in the room who are old enough to remember that far back you can remember Bibi Netanyahu at the UN with his poster of Iran with its cartoon bomb you know Joe alluded to the the article in the Atlantic which was incredibly you know far-reaching comprehensive and well sourced making the case that pretty much everybody was ready to bomb Iran the Obama administration went into the negotiations that led to the day CCPOA because the other path was a pretty direct path to war and the drums of war we're beating both here and in Israel they're clearly beating both here and in Israel again and you know someone said it's a you know a catastrophic decision I think one man's catastrophe is another man's miracle there are people who welcome a breakdown of this agreement and welcome the possibility about getting back to the possibility of regime change and it's very clear and there is a strong constituency for this in Israel and their fellow travels travelers here are very much in the ascendancy that is the direction this goes right now based on where we are at this moment what interests me although nothing about the president surprises me but he did campaign as somebody kind of as isolationist somebody does not want to continue regime change save money and close down bases and so forth and so on in the midst of all that he has hired as his Security Council chief john bolton who was as i recall one of the architects for the war in iraq lied about weapons of mass destruction and so forth what does what does that tell us is I I think it's a very interesting point but pres think of President Trump is having two voices in his head two voices whispering at least to one of them is the one you refer to which is during the campaign he actually argued against entanglements he's melis mentioned that seven trillion dollars we wasted in the Middle East he was against he says maybe belatedly but still against the war in Iraq he said he was against intervention in Syria against intervention in Libya that's one voice the other voice is a voice that says I have to do everything Obama didn't do I have to undo his legacy and the voice it says I got to be tough I got a show that I'm prepared to fight back that I'm the the macho and and as you say who surrounds himself with people who today are giving much more voice to that second voice forget amplifying it it's Sean Bolton it's even Mike Pompeo the Secretary of State both of them are in the record is saying that the best way to deal with Iran's nuclear program is to change the regime they've said by the way the same about North Korea so I think there's a struggle in for for president Trump Seoul if I could put it that way but right now that latter voice the one that is dangerous the one that is putting us on a path to confrontation because let's assume tomorrow that Iran decides to respond to the what the u.s. did by resuming its nuclear its nuclear program then we're back with what Lars said we're back to 2010 and then the voices that John Bolton's and others could tell the president you get a hit you got to show the world you get a shore on that the u.s. is back we got our mojo back and then we're on that very very dangerous path against which President Trump warned us himself warned us when he was a candidate sure well first of all I think with this move president Trump has for sure put us on an escalatory path with Iran but I'm not so sure he sees a path towards war with Iran I do think that perhaps he sees a war outside around among its proxies and skirmishes happening and maybe he's deluded enough to think that he can manage those crises and they not escalate into a full regional war I think that's very dangerous the other thing that I think he's done that's been so destabilizing is that he has thrown the u.s. his full support behind Saudi Arabia and he has stoked the fire within the Middle East rather than comment and it's strategically such a bad move because the u.s. traditionally has sought to play a role of a moderator or an honest broker and by siding completely with the Saudis we've relinquished that role we've given up any leverage we have in actually playing a constructive role in trying to mediate that conflict so I think that is a very short itself very short-sighted approach and the Iranians have consistently said they're ready to come to the table in regional dialogue with the Saudis and the Saudis are not well why should they why should MBS come to the table he feels emboldened he has the full support of Trump there's no reason for him to come and negotiate and compromise in any way so I think that's another element of the Trump approach to the Middle East and this deal that is very dangerous let me ask the kind of dumb-bunny question and maybe the answer is obvious but I'm not sure everybody knows it as Suzanne just mentioned we are now and I've been in kind of high-level classified meetings where people referred to Saudi Arabia so a forever ally kindred spirit meanwhile correct me if I'm wrong Saudi Arabia is a despotic autocracy we can argue about how good were fed the Iranian elections are but they do hold elections I'm not quite sure that be that the Prince of Saudi Arabia was elected to anything he has the distinction of having purchased the most expensive house in the world a five hundred million dollar yacht and I guess the Leonardo da Vinci painting for 450 million dollars while bemoaning the suffering of the people in Gaza why has the policies of the United States been so steered toward Saudi Arabia and so on anti Iran when in fact you have as you mentioned Suzanne among the younger people of Iran but most of the country is under 30 now they are very Pro Weston they feel a lot better about the United States and the young people in Saudi Arabia Joe why how did that happen I think the simple answer is money before the Iranian Revolution 1979 our main client in the Middle East was Iran was the Shah of Iran they bought most of our weapons they were the linchpin of our security but since the Revolution America hasn't done much business in fact we're sanctioned American companies are sanctioned from doing business with with Iran and the money has all gone to the more the Arab states so Saudi Arabia is a main purchaser of US military equipment you saw the the meeting in the Oval Office where Donald Trump could not help himself he was talking about the enormous check that Saudi Arabia is about to write us for about a hundred billion dollars worth of military equipment of course there's the oil deals and the and and and those arrangements and that is true of all the the Arab Gulf states and then Saudi Arabia and the Arab states used some of those oil witches to buy influence here in the United States it is very difficult to go to an American University and not see some Sunni Arab endowed center or to go to a think tank in Washington and not see major contributions or halls named after some of the some of the Saudi princes so they they buy a lot of influence in this town they buy a lot of business in this town but if we're simply that it wouldn't be so bad what's happened now is that Saudi Arabia is in a struggle for regional dominance with Iran and they want to draw us in on their side they want us to be actively involved militarily in pushing back the Persian Shia state and Israel has decided to block with Saudi Arabia and so you're setting up this major regional conflict that as Suzanne has said if we had just played our normal historic moderating role we might be tamping down instead of pouring gasoline on the fires but Robin Laura this is I mean there is a history of mutual anger recrimination and between Iran and and the United States since the Revolution I mean what u.s. administrations and not just this one but going back to the Carter Administration would say is in Iran there was a hostage crisis support for organizations and direct acts of terrorism against the United States support for ghen is a shion's that are also hostile to israel on the other side of the ledger Ron would say support for the Shah the shooting down of an Iran air civilian aircraft that killed 200 I forget how many Iranians civilians support for Saddam Hussein and his use of chemical weapons against Iran during the very long iran-iraq war remind me of what wrong with American outrage about the use of chemical weapons was not so loud pretty muted I think is a fair word the UN Security Council resolution that was going to condemn Iraq for used in chemical weapons so there's a history there but the way to resolve that history is through diplomacy you know you could put pressure but it's through diplomacy the only way in which the United States and others have managed since the Iranian Revolution to change one aspect of Iranian behavior was through the nuclear deal that President Trump just read it that was a successful way to engage with Iran to get them to change their behavior we should instead of ripping up the deal we should be building on it talking to Ron about parts of their policy that we resent and they're gonna put a lot on the table that they resent our primary embargo our support for Saudi Arabia our arm sells to Saudi Arabia our policy toward the Middle East in general but what we're doing now is simply as Joe and others have said we're simply fueling the flames of a conflict because we are not talking to Ron there's no diplomacy with Iran right now and we're in the midst of an escalator dynamic Thank You senator it's important to remember the other thing that by withdrawing from this deal the one channel the one official channel we had with the Iranians is now gone and that was the channel called the Joint Commission where we met with Iranians and our other partners to discuss this deal well now that we're not a party to it anymore we don't get a seat at the table and when you think about it we're now back to prior to the deal when we didn't have official channel with Iran that's very dangerous because that channel has served to help I think stave off conflict that could have gotten out of hand for example when those Iranian sailors strayed and US sailors straight into Iranian waters it was because of the channel between the u.s. and Iran over the nuclear deal that helped to diminish that from escalating into a big a big deal that's gone now and that's a very dangerous review for me for us a little bit about what's going on internally in Iran right now we were talking earlier Suzanne and others have suggested that if you are a hardliner in Iran you are really delighted and happy with what Trump has done on the other hand if you are a moderate err for your young person want to reach out to the world if you want better Iran being part of the global community and wait isn't right now you're not very happy so this decision has benefited the hardliners in Iran is that correct well ironically it was the hardliners that began the negotiations with the US during the Ahmadinejad period but then with the advent of rouhani and his election that's when things really started to crystallize so I think the group of negotiators in Iran that brought this deal to the fore they took a major personal risk in doing this advocating for engagement with the United States the Great Satan so now here they are they were the people that put their necks on the line to become part of the this deal and of course the hardliners are taking great advantage of it by calling attention to the fact that they were treasonous that they put around interests in jeopardy it's important to remember that the Iranian political system is as complex as ours even a bit more cutthroat if you want to think about it it's not there competing power centers and it's a very dynamic political system so now what I'm afraid we may see is a rise in power of the more conservative hardline voices because this deal has not worked out for the moderate they are saying we told you so you can't trust the United States the leader himself Hamid a has essentially said look I told you that we can trust the United States and what happened just now proves that I just say I mean just it's building what Suzanne said during the negotiations who in Iran was talking against it who was arguing against it it's the very it's the hardliners in Iran at the same time as the Trump administration says that this deal was benefiting the hardliners and benefiting the Revolutionary Guards they were arguing against it they didn't want to see it come to pass so I think we could trust their judgment that they thought this deal was not good for the hardline Iranians it was better for the more pragmatic forces which this decision by President Trump has just undermined you know I which I said we were talking beforehand and we've all had these conversations in the past week about what the unintended consequences of this this decision by the Trump administration might be and the question of whether one unintended consequence is strengthening the hardliners weakening the moderates and and I really do believe that that is a feature not a bug of this policy it is much easier if you are someone who believes that this deal could not be fixed it had to be next and actually believes that the Iranian regime cannot be fixed it must be next it's much better to be dealing with a an absolutely irredeemable hardline interlocutor we should say not if you're talking to them and you can say that's the real face that's our real enemy the implacable enemy that we have to defeat utterly so both Trump here and the hardliners there got their wish and there is this myth in town that the Iranian regime might be on its last legs you know let's not kid ourselves there were major structural problems inside Iran they're there they're suffering from from years of drought there's major unrest especially in the rural areas this is a very unpopular regime none of us would like to live in Iran none of us would choose to live under this kind of autocratic regime but it is also very resilient it is also a stable US government structure at the moment compared to everything else that's going on in the Middle East and you hear all you do is read the the Iranian press our English translations of it and you see Ron Ian's protesting against their government but they don't want to go so far as to destabilize the government they don't want to overthrow the government because I don't want the chaos that they see going on in Syria so this is myth in this town that if we just knock hard enough that somehow the Iranian regime's gonna gonna crumble and what I fear is exactly this that the hardliners will come to power you don't like the Iranian regime now this could get a whole lot worse like it's important at this stage to say maybe it goes without saying but I think it's important that there are activities the Iranians are undertaking in the region that undercut fuel interests there's no question there that that's happening and but the point is how do you go about changing that how do you go about addressing it I think you're out bet today in The Guardian makes the case through dialogue and with this deal I mean think about it when I brought up the case of Mossadegh Sauveur throw the democratically elected prime minister we overthrow him that was 65 years ago and there have been a lot of grievances in this relationship and yet three years ago we reached this deal with the Iranians it was a triumph of diplomacy and yes the relationship isn't perfect it's far from it but we should have used it as a I think the Iranian Foreign Minister called it we should use it not as the floor but not as the ceiling but as the floor and we're doing the exact opposite I think for the Trump administration the idea of doing the work the hard work of diplomacy is so foreign to them that maybe it was too much to think about but yet it's an opportunity here we are again a enormous opportunity we've squandered to build on that deal and to make it something more lasting to change the essence of the relationship in a meaningful way and it was just discarded without a plan B without any alternative and I think that the administration has not offered anything in terms of where we go from here and our European allies certainly are grappling with us now there they're faced with a region where they are adjacent to this region there they have the influx of refugees from all the conflicts so this was not only this was an attack on our European allies sovereignty on their economic relationship with air Iran but also on their national security American policy in the Middle East is in free fall we have no clear plan we're losing friends losing influence losing allies this is going to get this could get very dangerous I just I just man I'm not sure I've heard people say there's no plan B and I think from any sort of objective analytical standpoint that is that seems correct and strong plan is the constructive because I do think there it there are Plan B's and we've already heard them we've heard them in the media suddenly we're back to the the narrative of well if we push a little harder the Iranian people will overthrow their government they just need our help and support which is a movie that we've seen before not just on Iran let's take Gaza for example we've seen that exact movie before history would argue that you the US has never had success at turning other people into tools of our foreign policy by making them so miserable they say let me take up the flag of your we are consistent we keep making the mistake mistake over and over again right well you know again I don't want to pretend I'm in the heads of the people I disagree with I think a lot of people believe this should be true and if it turns out not to be true at least we should have tried and if it turns out not to be true and we're forced to go to war for the sake of humanity we are but that is that is sort of the plan B here we will help and try to have them overthrow themselves and if forced because don't forget if Iran does go back to centrifuges spinning we are back to the discussion of it being an existential threat that was BB nut to nail with that dub that bomb and when it's an existential threat to Israel how many days is it till they go nuclear is it ten days is it a hundred days who's constantly changing target at that point we have no choice but to act because it's an existential threat I want to get back to Saudi Arabia NBS that a multi-million dollar tour of the United States he was a lot of meteor met with a lot of influential people what is Saudi Arabia really and what are its goals well I think you know the Saudis are in the midst of a leadership transition I think that you know when you look at what President Obama tried to do to rebalance the u.s. in the Middle East by having a relationship with both the Iranians and the Saudis maybe to some extent underestimated the insecurities of the Saudis during this pivotal period and underestimated how threatening they would see the fact that the u.s. is beginning a relationship with Iran that's something we can debate but when we think about the Saudis they have this this humanitarian disaster that they've created in Yemen a war by the way that the United States says has you know not spoken out against too harshly and it would say that's an understatement eclis then you have if you look at every major crises point in the Middle East you know the solution to it somehow runs through Riyadh and Tehran and if you also look at this undertaking that MBS the Saudi prince is trying to take for a major reform effort by the year 2030 in Saudi Arabia it's very forward-looking if he can pull it off it really makes you wonder what are their priorities and why aren't we encouraging that reform effort telling them find a solution in Yemen stop that catastrophic war get to the table with Iranians work that out find a political settlement in Syria strengthen this new government that's going to happen in Iraq I mean there are some serious issues that we should be encouraging the Saudis and Iranians now to come to the table and resolve and we're doing the exact opposite well yeah so I'd say and I've had opportunity to discuss this with Mohammed bin Salman several times I think from his perspective to try to put myself in his shoes he believes Saudi Arabia for too long has been a punching bag that Iran has been hitting and that he believes Saudi Arabia is stronger militarily diplomatically a stronger allies why shouldn't Saudi Arabia fight back now the problem with the fighting back is that everything that people say today is in an indication of Iran expanding its reach in the region has been the result of people going to war in the region the Iraq war obviously number one if it hadn't been for the Iraq war Iran would not have the influence it has today in Iraq the war in Lebanon talk back in the 1980s the war in Lebanon in Israel Israel invasion that gave rise to Hezbollah that gave Iran a hook in Lebanon Yemen we just heard about a humanitarian disaster the worst humanitarian disaster in the world today what's increased Iran's influence it's the it's the coalition saudi-led coalition bombing of Yemen the Houthis the the the the Shedd organization there has become closer to Ron bein in reaction and on and on and on the same in Syria war is what has expanded Iran's influence and so and I've said this to the Saudis I said you may think that by pushing back around militarily you're gonna help yourself you're simply going to empower Iran in a way that you're gonna regret so what I what I what I would would criticize the the Trump administration for yes they have much better relations with Saudi Arabia than we did under the Obama administration use that better relationship for sound policies as Susanne's as Suzanne said put pressure on them to find a way out of Yemen and by the way I do want to thank you for your efforts on Yemen I think we need more voices like yours to to put the spotlight on that on that tragedy use it for that use it to push them to negotiate with Iran use it constructively use that better relationship you have with Saudi Arabia and with by the way but to a purpose that serves US interests not enabling them to make the mistakes that they and we are going to pay for Laura do you want to say a word about Israel and back it up a little bit Israel today is not the political state that it was 20 years ago it has undergone massive transformation and you know I asked Rob what the long-term goals of Saudi Arabia might be what are the goals of the Netanyahu administration there and what are the changes that have taken place in Israel over the last couple of decades so it it's a timely question because it's something that I think we can understand and explain better in the United States now than we could have two years ago and the sort of archival liberalism Israel is significantly ahead of the United States but it's on very much the same path you have an Israeli government which is tending further and further right not simply for cynical reasons of you know politicking and and appealing to certain voters there are real ideological roots in this and what we're seeing today is very much in power a trend towards in liberalism much like we're seeing here or in Eastern Europe or wherever else which says we have ideals we will implement them might makes right rule of the majority not democracy little interest in the power of the civil society or even preserving civil society things like Human Rights a disdain for international law international norms to the extent that they in any way conflict with those goals and what we're seeing today and we had an on display in in Jerusalem today if anyone saw the visuals the split screen of the celebrations in Jerusalem the American officials starting with mr. Kushner and and the president's daughter celebrating and split screen showing tear gas and shooting on people inside Gaza and I think it's important to emphasize whether you want to argue that these are violent or nonviolent whatever these are or inside Gaza these are not people who have invaded Israel and are now and threatening to take the town this is shooting into Gaza so you really have an alliance of a liberalism here it isn't by mistake that Israeli policies are getting more and more energetic again towards Iran towards the Palestinians aggressive might be another word aggressive or embolden let's say this is an ideological strain I think you know I think it's really important when I said before one man's catastrophe is another man's miracle this is not happening I think by accident and I think it's important to recognize the ideological roots of this if you're going to understand where it goes these aren't just missed steps all the way these are deliberate steps the Israeli government wants to keep the West Bank in Gaza forever it wants every inch of Jerusalem it's very clear about that the American ambassador to Israel is absolutely in lockstep with that and he's been on the record that way for years anyone who's surprised you shouldn't be and for folks who see the Trump administration is chaotic in their policymaking I would encourage them to look at Israel Palestine and that reflects also on Iran and note that the circle of people who have been the key advocates and the key advisors to the President on this issue are the same people who were his closest advisors before he came president and they were the people who were his surrogates during the campaign there's been remarkable coherence to their policy in the Middle East and to the extent that we're talking about Saudi Arabia I think it's a mistake to not focus on the Israel piece of that because the the idea that NBS is going to deliver the Palestinians are going to give cover for Israel on Israel Palestine is a potent piece of the puzzle here it is a potent piece it has enormous resonance here in the United States it has enormous resonance in Israel where right now Israelis see the alliance with Saudi Arabia as far more important than resolving the conflict that is on their border or 50 some people were killed today and even if you believe that Israel is 100 percent justified and it's an of self-defense Israel killed 50 I think 54 people on its it's not even a border the Gaza fence that's not a situation that's going to be resolved by making backroom deals with Saudi Arabia but that's where we are today and it really the the the trajectory of this is not encouraging not because of missteps but because we're headed very deliberately in a direction that is not encouraging let's you know while we're on the Israel in Gaza but let's continue that discussion I mean it looks to me not only of the events of today but just the actions of Israel over the last several years plus the Trump administration repudiating the concept of a two-state solution the growth of settlements the kind of violence that we saw today what is going to happen in the future when you have two million people in Gaza living in absolute desperation 60 percent uses unemployment what these couldn't be the future they're what we see happening let me start but I have to admit my bias here because I'm very pro-israel I have family in Israel my family in Jerusalem I have a niece and nephew who served in the IDF I have a goddaughter who very recently was a sniper on the Gaza border so I'm very concerned about their security and I would never advocate a policy that would weaken the security of Israel but what I fear is that the policies of this government in Israel are weakening the security of Israel that the Israel's becoming less and less secure by their but by the look could parties refusal to find a way to negotiate with the Palestinians to end the occupation to give some basic human rights to the the people in that prison we call Gaza that this is is building up the the frustration the hopelessness to a point where it is going to explode and today I'm afraid might have lit the fuse this is the most Palestinians Israel is killed short of an outright war in a single day this is more people than Palestinians that died during either one of the Intifada see this is an unprecedented situation in some ways we're not paying enough attention to this because we're distracted by our own political circus at home I mean you know if we didn't have this kind of internal division at home I think this would be the top story everybody was discussing we'd have American diplomats flying to the area to try to calm it down to try to find some way to restart the peace talks instead we have this this show in Jerusalem that I just found out no Democrats were invited to this opening this was a very selective audience here to celebrate this tragic turn in American policy no American president who all strongly supportive of Israel have ever thought we should move the embassy to Jerusalem because it wasn't our place to decide that issue the Palestinians and the Israel Israelis had to decide what the borders were and by doing this we're intervening in that internal struggle putting our thumb on the scale on one side and all this just makes the situation worse but every single other person on this panel is more expert I'm just talking let me just ask anyone to jump in talk a little bit about what is going on in Gaza right now what's going on sure I'll try to take that one I have not been in Gaza in a couple of years what is going on in Gaza right now our number of factors are coalescing it come to a head part of it is Jerusalem Jerusalem lit lit the the fuse this time the first fuse Joe referred to a second fuse the announcement in December which really I mean Jerusalem let's remember gazans can't get to Jerusalem it's been years since cozzens have been able either take it you know this stuff upside downside many people do not what do you mean by they can't go so Palestinians who live in Gaza have restricted travel to get from Gaza to Jerusalem you have to cross through Israel Israel does not let Gazans leave Gaza except under very very limited circumstances through a long permit process which is arduous and and generally it it's very very difficult to travel so most cousins if the average I don't know what the the percentage is it's under 30 it's very high a huge percentage of those people have never been to Jerusalem have never been to the West Bank they basically have only ever been to Gaza or maybe they've gotten out through through it Egypt it's it is a place that has been under blockade for a decade now and this is one of the most densely populated places in the world it is run by Hamas which is a terrorist organization it happens to have been a democratically elected some years back that was rejected by the world like like joe said it's probably in the same sense as iran it's not probably a place you'd want to live i would not want to live under hamas governments but living there there is now the for years people in gaza have been had their lives subjected to all sorts of misery on the argument that this is the way to eject hamas from gaza and it hasn't worked what it means is today you have this densely populated place with a very very high youth population extraordinarily high unemployment extraordinarily high poverty dependent on outside aid and you essentially with the jerusalem decision said by the way there is zero political horizon for ending the conflict and only an end to the conflict can actually resolve the situation you're in everything else is just giving you you know bandages and some aspirin that's what the jerusalem decision was but what we're seeing on the Gaza fence and you can't call it a border because it's not a border what you're seeing on the fence is all of the pressures that have built up over the years coming to a head with this decision and then you've got Hamas trying to ride them ride these pressures and where they can direct them so that they can claim legitimacy because when the grassroots rises up and says we will not have it anymore that's also a repudiation of the people in charge and that's intolerable for Hamas because Hamas needs to be in charge so you have people fighting for who's controlling it which gives Israel a sometimes legitimate time's not legitimate excuse to say this is all terrorism this is an act of war and under the laws of war we have the right to use lethal force against unarmed people who are near the fence which if they were to damage that fence and breach it they could come into Israel would be a threat to us and I don't see honestly a dying I suspect that we will see this period of intense demonstrations die down combination of fatigue a combination of outside efforts to to throw in more bandages and more aspirin which I have to say it would be immoral at this moment to oppose food bandages aspirin whatever it takes because the humanitarian situation there is genuinely turning catastrophic but we have to remember this is not an earthquake zone this is an entirely man-made catastrophe and the reason if the solution to it is not humanitarian aid the solution to this is a political solution and right now going back to where we started we're heading in the opposite direction from a political solution yeah I'd say you know it's customary to say that the Arab world and the world is forgetting the Palestinians I'll tell you some people who haven't forgotten the Palestinians and that's the Palestinians and they're the ones who are living into this in the situation that Laura described in in Gaza and also living in deplorable such conditions in the West Bank where there is no political horizon now the cost is it's a human cost no doubt about it and it's a powder keg and at some point it may explode it may be today maybe in a month it may be in a year but some you know at some point if people have no hope and they're living in these conditions they have nothing to lose but there's a there's another cost all this which is really and and I was in I was visiting the occupied territories a few months ago and anyone who does it's very hard to look at that and think that a two-state solution is still possible today because of everything that's been happening in terms of the settlements and the roads and just the the conditions on the ground so then what I mean if you've killed the two-state solution you've killed that paradigm you've basically neutered all of the political leaders in Palestine and among the Palestine who were foot soldiers for that for that cause what are you left with maybe a won States a call for one state solution civil rights equal rights for all or is Jews can accept that so you may be setting up a perpetual conflict which today we are enabling again it goes back to the point we've all made the u.s. can't solve this just you know just because it wants to solve it but to enable policies that are moving us away from a two-state settlement and that are moving us towards a potential conflict between a desperate population that has no hope and the Israeli government that's diplomatic malpractice I would just add going back again to this being a feature not a bug there have been Israelis Israeli people in the Israeli right and that people on the American side who support the Israeli right who have been arguing for years there is no solution I mean this is not the idea that no solution is a failure there are many people who would argue there's never been a solution the answer is for the u.s. to get behind Israel let Israel do what it needs to do let it define what it needs to do and what it wants to do we get behind it and recognize the Palestinian is that's just going to remain an unsolved issue that is actually a position that is advocated in our world that's a group of 2 million people living in misery in Gaza with no political power in the indefinite future some would you oh well it's more than that because that includes the West Bank the no solution refers to East Jerusalem the West Bank and Gaza so it's many more than that let me kind of end the discussion here it's been a fairly pessimistic discussion if I may say so because it's a pessimistic situation and we're trying to look at it honestly what would well I won't ask what the administration should do as we know it they are doing which is unprecedented I mean somebody correct me if I'm wrong but I think historically administration's have always given at least lip service for trying to bring people together in the Mideast right whether they did it or not at least they made the effort that we got to sit down and work it out and pieces our goal and an unprecedented way that it's not really what Trump is saying what should you know one of the areas Rob mentioned this in terms of Yemen where I think there is a growing understanding that in the Congress the Constitution is very clear that it is the US Congress and not the president was war-making powers and we all know that Congress has abdicated that on the Democratic and Republican leadership for a very long time and some of us are trying to get it back and trying to get the Congress more involved on issues like the issues we have discussed here tonight so I'm not going to ask you what the Trump administration should do because we know what they are doing what should those of us in Congress who believe that we should have an even-handed policy in the Middle East in terms of Israel and Palestine as well in terms of Saudi Arabia in Iran what would make sense to you to see for those of us to be doing well in terms of Yemen I think it's important to remember that the Iranians and the EU for the French UK Germans and Italians have now had I think two rounds of discussions on Yemen and I suppose now that the United States is this is through part of the jcpoa process I don't know if the US will even be part of this now let's face it the Trump administration with this move on the jcpoa has abdicated u.s. leadership on a whole host of issues it's not just the jcpoa and i think we have to face reality we can't really look to this administration for leadership on these crises these issues of top national security importance to us but what we can do now is I just came from Europe last night where I met with Europeans and Iranians and what the Europeans are saying is they see this as a direct attack on their sovereignty they're going to look for ways to continue to keep the deal alive look for ways to maybe do blocking sanctions against the US other ways of licenses so European businesses can continue to do business with Iran and the Iranians for their part I think they're going to show a fair amount of restraints in the aftermath of this disastrous decision I think they're going to continue to abide by the Iran deal they're not going to restart the centrifuges they're not going to kick out the inspectors I think they're gonna try to work with the Europeans the Russians and the Chinese to make this deal work and work on the other issues you just mentioned but again the u.s. is absent this is not America first this is America alone and I think the only way we're going to solve this problem is by electing a new president a new Congress in November I don't see any other solution senator let me start this there's a several things that the US Congress can do now and and part of that builds off what Suzanne just said we have to try to work with the Europeans to keep the deal alive so what we're worried about is to deal completely falling about remember this is like the Paris climate Accord just because the u.s. withdraws doesn't mean the Accord is dead no the deal is still alive for now and the Europeans and the Russians and Chinese are working as Suzanne said with the Orions to try to keep them in so what do they need in order to do that the Europeans need to be able to do business with Iran but the administration's about to move to put sanctions on European companies remember we don't do business with Iran we don't sell so you can't sanction our own companies you got a sanction the other companies that are doing this you got to start sanctioning the people who will buy or buying oil from Iran who's that that's China number one European Union number 2 in Japan number 3 in India and India so you're going to start sanctioning those people well that is idiotic so we've already have this rift developing between Europe and the United States you know it's it's we are weakening the Western alliance with this it Middle East all those problems aside we also have this other huge problem that this policy is creating so the I believe the Senate the Congress has to step in and try to prevent the administration from imposing new sanctions on European companies that's that's the number one thing I would do the number two thing I would do is try to take another run on Yemen you came real close 44 senators voted for that resolution if you could could get a pause in the Yemen war if you could stop the u.s. from aiding that slaughter that would be a huge confidence builder be huge humanitarian and peace building and stability building step in the Middle East and you can do that without the administration I agree with you there let me deal with the secondary boycott issue is this rather extraordinary that we are now putting sanctions on our major international allies is this of some it's try to do it before it's not had much success and I think as Jo said that's not that's not a road we want to be on if we want to build a coalition to get anything done yeah but you know you asked you said then I'm it's a pretty pessimistic time and when I apologize with people listening if it was but I want to end on a domestic note I think the reason for optimism is the fact that you're holding a discussion like this that people are listening that people many many many thousands are listening outside and following this I think what can be done and building on this is having a more honest conversation with the American people having a more honest conversation coming from members of Congress on issues like what are we doing between Israelis and Palestinians what are we doing with Iran what are we doing with Saudi Arabia what are we doing in the war on Yemen what are we doing another issue that you've written about and the pastor spoken about what about a counterterrorism policy is it really the smart policy we need to have a debate about that we need to have a debate about War Powers and that's where hope comes from it's from bringing Americans engaging them convincing them that this is not foreign this is very much domestic because as you put it this is what this is where we put our resources this is how we send our men and women to war so foreign policy is domestic policy is is public policy let me just conclude by saying that I think the overwhelming majority of the American people believe that the function of the United States in global politics is to do everything that we can to prevent war and the incredible some you know what really bothers me and I speak is the former chair of the Veterans Committee how easy it is for people to give these great speeches about war in bombing and all that stuff and then you meet with the families and the young men and women who come home from these wars and the kind of terrible suffering we have seen in our own country as a result of Iraq and Afghanistan not to mention you know the 500,000 dead in Iraq and the massive displacement of people all of the suffering that exists and I say sometimes we don't see that sometimes we don't see that as people but I do believe that in our heart of hearts as a people the American people do want to see their government play a constructive role around the world understanding how difficult it is but bringing people together get them to sit down get them to put away the guns and the planes and the tanks and it is a sad thing that at this moment we're doing the exact opposite but I agree with you I am I mean this may have been pessimistic in the sense that we're talking about reality but I don't think that is where the American people want I want us to be and especially when we talk about a world think about it a world now we got children all over the world living dying unnecessarily because they don't have the fuse - the parents are of a few cents to buy medicine to cure it easily treat a disease yet people living on a dollar a day two dollars a day and the world is spending but well over a trillion dollars a year on weapons of destruction our role should be the role of bringing people together striving for world peace as hard as that may be and I am NOT pessimistic that that is where the American people are so let me just conclude by thanking our panelists are thanking all of you for being here or this evening and thanking those who are watching us live stream thank you all very much
