well we got hoodwinked and I will admit I was optimistically expecting Barack and Michelle Obama to fade into obscurity most presidents do after their term and any and all logical thought process would understandably compel someone to believe that President Obama who has famously said that his administration suffered no scandals Benghazi NSA IRS fast and furious uranium one yeah but no scandals anyway that president who campaigned aggressively for the woman he thought would succeed him a woman who promised to continue and expand upon his policies and America said nope we said no no thank you no sir we have had enough of you we have had enough pretty clear message or so you'd think but apparently they did not get the memo because Barack and Michelle Obama just signed a multi-year deal with Netflix to produce and write both scripted and non-scripted documentary type content the deal is reportedly valued at over 50 million dollars that's some serious churching for those presidential moochers and just what we need more Dreams from My Father propaganda garbage I can imagine their repertoire will be full of storylines propagating the notion that Barack Obama was the greatest president ever and they will somehow find a way to convince people that the IRS scandal was actually good for America and maybe even convince some people that Michelle Obama's school meals program found a great deal of favor with school children because you know kids love to starve while they're at school if you want to cancel your Netflix subscription I have a few items that I found online that are actually under $10 which is the monthly Netflix fee first we have cat butt gum I'm not sure if it looks like a cat's butt or if it just tastes like it but either way it's definitely better than Netflix I also found you some jelly Belly jelly beans that taste like draught beer so that's definitely better than a cat's butt and Netflix and one more suggestion a beard that looks like a swarm of bees because I don't actually know what the purpose of that one is but even if they were real bees on your face and throat it would still be better than Netflix but on a serious note what's my best suggestion Netflix is 10 a month guess how much a subscription to the rebel is $8 so not only are you saving $2 a month that's $24 a year I can come up with a whole new list of things that you can buy for that and with the rebel you're getting accurate truthful meaningful content so do yourself a favor drop Netflix and subscribe to the rebel thanks for watching everybody I'm Amanda head for the rebel if you enjoyed my commentary and opinions we have an unlimited supply of them over here at the rebel so subscribe to our premium content at WWWE need forward slash shows follow us on Facebook and Twitter for all of our latest news and download our app for the rebel media on the app store that way you will have easy and immediate access to all of our latest videos and your favorite rebel shows
