I don't know if he missed it but there was a really gross outburst on Twitter by a Liberal MP earlier this month it was by this woman a first term Liberal MP from Whitby Ontario her name is Selena Caesar savannahs she immigrated to Canada from Grenada which is a small island in the Caribbean and she's actually been a great success in Canada she's got a Bachelor of Science degree and then an MBA Canada is being great to her to she she might have done well back in Grenada but I don't know it's a pretty poor country pretty small country and she has just soared in Canada there'd be no limits on her a success in business a success in life and now she's an MP not just an MP she's a parliamentary secretary to a cabinet minister that's like being a junior cabinet minister so yeah Canada has made her dreams come true but she's grouchy she's a black woman who has done everything she wants to do more than anyone could reasonably hope to do but she still sees racism and sexism everywhere a few months ago in December she posted this huge long Facebook rant from Parliament Hill she said that someone walked into the public bathroom when she was in there and that person who put her wallet down on the table let me quote from her Facebook ran this is an MP a parliamentary secretary but but she just had to write hundreds of words about this let me read as she placed her wallet down and our eyes met in the reflection in the mirror she said don't steal my wallet okay my smile joy and excitement vanished she noticed because she quickly responded with and I was just joking with a little sprinkle of like duh on the side now was that a dumb joke that someone made the other lady immediately said that it was but Selina Caesar Havana's it was obviously racism why I mean I I think it's dumb to leave a wallet out in a public bathroom even in Parliament I'd be worried someone would take my wallet anyone I wouldn't do that but but what does race have to do with that other than the fact that Selina cesar chavez meticulously described the race of everyone else in her story about the bathroom the whole thing is weird but the weirdest part is that instead of shrugging it off as a dumb joke or even if she is right even if it was racist which I think it's a stretch making such a big public fuss about it I mean you're an MP your parliamentary secretary to a cabinet minister even if you have a one-minute moment in your day how about realize how privileged you are how powerful you are but let me read the very next part of her facebook rant because it's worse and I think it confirms my take on that wallet thing this is a hypersensitive woman with a huge chip on her shoulder looking for reasons to be offended let me quote this is from our own Facebook page you're a junior cabinet minister really that's what a parliamentary secretary is you have enormous power and privilege you're making decisions affecting millions of people you're traveling the world you have a large audience of people who listen to you but this is what you gripe about she mentions this literally in the next sentence after the wallet paranoia thing ready earlier that day the security at Wellington did not open the door for me to enter even though I have been working in that building for a year and being a member of parliament for two years so you're mad that a security guard didn't didn't open the door for you is that a security guards job being in doorman a concierge a fluffer or is their job to do security and Halon I didn't know that feminists waited around for men to open doors for them anymore she's a parliamentary secretary though so she she makes more than even normal MPs do just a shade under $200,000 a year plus free travel plus expenses plus an office in Ottawa plus an office and with me plus a staff so Her Majesty is furious that a blue-collar security guard who's there to keep her safe another perk of being an MP didn't jump right up and get the door for her and you guessed it that's racism no sister that it's not racism that's your anger your paranoia your sense of entitlement which is wholly unfounded you came from a poor country where per-capita GDP is less than a third of what it is in Canada the entire population of Grenada is smaller than the population of you're riding and Whitby you left there to come here to be great even if you were queen of Grenada you'd be less than you are in Canada and she's angry because some working-class slep didn't bow down her and she's calling him a racist for not opening the door she's the one who in her bizarre Facebook post is describing everyone by their race here's the part I skipped over about the great bathroom incident let me quote the first older with sandy blonde hair walked straight past me and into the stall the second the younger blonde although not natural because she needed to get her roots done proceeded to put her wallet on the counter by the front door yes sister besides being catty and gossipy and judgmental of your fellow parliamentary women I think you're running a little hot on race don't you think she literally used the phrase microaggressions twice in her rant ass on a joke I think she meant it again if all you're dealing with in your life is microscopic problems maybe it's time to catch your blessings and realize you don't have any big problems and maybe be grateful to the country that is welcome to you and the people who work under you including lowly security guards even if they are yeah quite anyways that was an outburst by her in December that just sets the table here fast forward to March it started with the budget a couple weeks ago when another immigrant to Canada a Muslim migrant from Somalia named Ahmed Hassan the immigration minister when he bizarrely published this tweet take a look a historic budget 2018 for racialized Canadians 19 million dollars for black youth and mental health national anti racism plan Center for racial and gender data 23 million dollars multiculturalism funding 30 1.8 million dollars for racialized newcomer women real change for equality and growth what is racialized mean it's not a real word I mean you can talk about race if you like but we don't like to do that in Canada because we like to be colorblind and treat everyone equally before the law that's why Selena Caesar savannahs came here that's why I'm at Husson came here I presume because we treat black people better in Canada ironically than they do in Somalia and they're black and there are more opportunities for black people in Canada than in Grenada because we're that friendly and free and tolerant no matter what your race is racialized that is a bizarre sociology word bs they teach in universities these days that tries to unteach equality and tries to replace equality with racial identity politics so you don't just see a group of friends anymore group of Canadians you're supposed to now see a black woman a gay man and have original person in a wheelchair it's forcing us into little identity groups that destroys our personal character and replaces it with just a big leftist Marxist class of people to be bought and sold by politicians 31.8 million dollars for racialized newcomer women how about just money for any immigrant women and how about immigrant men too and how about telling them that they're equal now and they can start to think of themselves as Canadian first now and that last line in his tweet real change for equality really so Canada needs to be changed the same Canada that accepted Ahmed Hudson and Celine Caesar Chavannes I'm pretty sure we're the most tolerant place on earth I'm pretty sure we don't need to be scolded and told we're not good enough by people who just arrived here and zoomed to the top and that's what Maksym Bernier the Conservative MP from Quebec that's what he said in Twitter look what he replied he said I thought the ultimate goal of fighting discrimination was to create a colorblind society where everyone is treated the same not to set some Canadians apart is being racialized what's the purpose of this awful jargon to create more division for the Liberals to exploit why he's exactly right well said thousands of people liked that comment by Bernie and retweeted it on Twitter he said it to Ahmed Hassan but our microaggression MP the one who's still fuming his security guards for not calling her your highness or whatever she jumped right in and she said this Maxine Bernie do some research or a google search as to why stating colorblindness as a defense actually contributes to racism please check your priveledge and be quiet since our government like research here is some evidence huh look at that logic pretzel if you're colorblind that's proof that you're racist so if you don't just judge people based on race that is racism seriously then she said that and then she said check your priveledge and be quiet as in shut up white boy it's pretty much what she meant now Maxine Bernays an opposition MP I'm at Husson as a cabinet minister Caesar Shyvana is as a parliamentary secretary both of them have privileged in every normal meaning of the word privileges I must be more candid it's likely unearned privilege while they did win their elections they were part of a cabinet the Justin Trudeau explicitly appointed based on quotas as far as privilege goes I don't think there's ever been a more privileged Prime Minister than Justin Trudeau again not earned privilege but wholly unearned privilege absolutely inherited by virtue of his famous last name by any kind of achievement or skill so Caesar Shyvana said shut up white boy to Maxine Bernier she is slightly different words she said check your priveledge and be quiet and then she told him to read a kooky article about how not being racist means you're racist but no you don't get to tell MPs to shut out based on race maybe you can tell security guards that or women in the bathroom that not a fellow parliamentarians in fact the word parliamentarian comes from the word to speak parley or parlay in French Bernie as parliamentary privilege means he can say whatever he likes in fact it's an opposition MP he has a constitutional duty to oppose what the government says or again as Bernie a put it so well he said huh edifying comments from a disgruntled Commons please check your privilege and me quiet you are aware we live in a democracy with free speech as one of its building blocks right that was pretty powerful and after a massive backlash Caesar savannahs said she was wrong she said Maxim Bernie I am not too big to admit when I was wrong limiting discussion on this important issue by telling you to be quiet was not cool if you were willing let's chat when back in Ottawa we are miles apart on this important issue and it is possible to come a little closer so it's not actually an apology she doesn't say she's sorry she said she was wrong about telling him to shut up but not about her weird race hucksterism now Bernie aim was not so easily mollified he wrote back he said thank you for recognizing my right to air an opinion I don't think we can find much common ground that however you and Minister Hudson implied I'm a racist because I want to live in a society where everyone is treated equally and not defined by their race exactly now he had four tweets in a row there but I in the interest of time I'm only going to read one more he said I say it's time we conservatives stop being afraid to defend our vision of a just society made up of free and equal individuals and push back against those who want to silence any opinion that differs from theirs right on absolutely conservatives are too easily scared into shutting up when someone calls them racist even if it's in a bizarro way like telling them that they're racist for not wanting to be racist because you see to a liberal that's proof that you're racist so Bravo to Maxine Burnie now this all happened on March 6th right after the budget and the next day Cesar Chavez had a speech at the fancy Empire club again couldn't be more privileged right she tweeted about it she said I have heard individuals say that I might be a one-term MP because I continue to speak up about issues and I accept that I accept that because my feminism requires me to be bold it requires me to smash and challenge the status quo hang on you came from a poor tiny country to our wonderful country you've been given wealth and power and privilege beyond your wildest dreams regardless of your race and sex and actually to be honest probably a little bit because of your race and sex in the affirmative action world of Justin Trudeau but you've come here to smash things that's what you said to smash things to destroy things seriously let me play the video clip that she selected from her own speech here's the video over the past few days it has been particularly challenging for myself in the role that I have I have heard individuals say that I might be a one-term MP because I continue to speak up about issues and I accept that I accept that because my feminism requires me to be bold it requires me to have uncomfortable conversations and to speak Mike it requires me to smash and challenge the status quo but my feminism isn't for everybody not everyone likes black coffee no sugar no cream so I implore you I implore you to be bold in your definition of your feminism we have an army of young girls and boys who here in Canada who are expecting no less from you thank you more of that BS sociology language learning comfortable conversations and speak my truth she can't take a bad joke in a bathroom she can't handle a security guard not jumping up to open the door for her she whines about microaggressions she tells other MPs to shut up pretty sure she can't handle uncomfortable conversations but what about that one line she said black coffee no sugar no cream black coffee no sugar no cream what does that mean is that a race thing sounds like a race thing she's talking about race and gender that that's how she defines herself remember known as the Canadian not even it's a liberal but as a racialized feminized whatever I mean what normal person goes around talking like that what normal person wants to engage with someone who does talk like that but black coffee no sugar no cream I think that's a race thing imagine if a white man said that about her or about himself she'd ever melt down so why did she say it about herself well because those words have a specific meaning it's a specific reference she didn't just make up outline herself that was from a famous speech given by Malcolm X the u.s. black activist who was contrary to Martin Luther King jr. who was also a black civil rights activist Martin Luther King jr. believed in peaceful protest like Gandhi Malcolm X believed in violence if necessary his real name was Malcolm little he changed it to Malcolm X he said it meant ex-mo corrects Drinker ex-christian ex-slave sometimes he also included ex-thief in that description he was a convicted criminal but mainly he was a black race he wanted black rights but he wanted racial segregation he wanted radicalization - he didn't want blacks to integrate he was the mirror image of the KKK in some ways he wanted a form of apartheid believe it or not and in one radical speech very famously in November 1963 Malcolm X talked about the evil white man that he called the common enemy of all different minorities he used that word the enemy again and again in his speech he didn't even like white liberals but don't take it from me here's a recording just under a minute of Malcolm X giving that speech 1963 describing what he thinks about white people and black coffee it's just like when you got some coffee this new black which means it's too strong what you do you can to create a decree you make it weak if you pour too much cream in you won't even know you ever had coffee it used to be hard it becomes cool it used to be strong it becomes weak it used to wake you up now to put you to sleep that is undoubtedly the reference this angry grouchy chip on her shoulder politician who came to Canada with nothing but was given everything who's that the highest heights of privilege pretends she's downtrodden that she was mistreated that she's disrespected because she's a black woman which she says at the Empire club as a parliamentary secretary she has copied the language of Malcolm X whatever else you say about Malcolm X at least he was addressing a real problem not a hundred years earlier there were there were actually slaves in America until the 1960s civil rights movement there were still racist laws in place called Jim Crow laws that kept the races separate and blacks were legal legally and culturally disadvantaged that was America in the 1960s I'm glad Martin Luther King was there to show the Christian way not the angry Nation of Islam way proposed by Malcolm X but what Cesar Chavez's excuse she was never a slave she came from an independent country called Grenada that's independent was independent before she was even born it's it's more than 80 percent black she has never felt a moment's racial prejudice or discrimination in her whole life and she came to Canada and it got even better but but she's quoting Malcolm X and his smear against white people saying white people ruin you his call for racial separatism if she wanted that why did she come to Canada and why does she not see what a fool she is to be using the language of the underdog the desperate poor afflicted underdog when she is the most privileged person in any room she enters other than one with Trudeau himself in it but most of all worst of all what aa racist bigot she is what a racist she is quoting another racist who says white people are like milk and coffee they room it they diluted they are the enemy of black people she's a race huckster but it's all fake she's never had a bad day in her life except the horrors of the microaggressions without one day in the parliamentary bathroom I nominate Selina Cesar Chavez as the most racist and in Canada's Parliament she is a disgrace and every Canadian needs to know it that's an excerpt from my daily TV show the yeas relevant show normally it's behind a paywall but I thought
