so much of the action in online dating is driven by the photos you post of yourself so one of the really big dilemmas about dating online is figuring out what to put on your profile bizarrely it turns out that very young men do pretty well if they take shirtless profile pic whereas you know if you're over the age of 30 and your shortlist is probably going to work much less well for you but also what we learned is that people are interested in profile photos that tell them something specifically about you and what you're interested in so if there's some activity that you do say spelunking get a picture of yourself spelunking in there if you have a really cute dog like put yourself up there with the dog ideally you've got a photograph of yourself spelunking while carrying the dog if you can pull that off you'll probably be dating every night for the rest of your life what works for women is slightly different those profile pictures where the camera is poised like above your head and coming down tend to do well there's different ways that you can smile into the camera and shockingly men tend to be more interested in that flirtatious smile than in that smile where you seem to be looking at somebody else you might want to have a drink but please don't do it on the camera in your profile picture because for whatever reason men will want to go out drinking with you but they don't want to see it in the photograph women are really interested in men's photographs when they include their pets but men don't want a photograph of a woman with a pet especially if it's a cat so you know just be careful follow the data
