we've all heard the stereotype that men are hard-wired for sex and are more likely to stray from their partner but that for women sex isn't that important that women want nothing more than commitment and emotional stability but that stereotype isn't true women also cheat on their partners but why I talked to psychotherapist and author in Gary Numan and he said that one of the main reasons that women cheat is sexual in frequency Newman surveyed 500 admitted cheaters and non cheaters the non-cheater said that they had sex with their partner an average of 10 times per month while the cheaters said that they had sex with their partners only five times a month Newman also cites communication or specifically at lack thereof as another reason that women cheat according to Newman non cheaters said that they spent an average of 30 to 60 minutes a day talking with their partner and the cheaters said that they spent less than five minutes talking with their partner every day and here's a really interesting statistic from dr. Helen Fisher an anthropologist at Rutgers Fischer cites a study where 34 percent of the cheating women surveyed said that they were happy in the relationship so the less happy the woman the more likely she is to cheat that makes sense right but this doesn't necessarily apply to men Fischer said that 56 percent of the cheating men said that they were happy in their relationship so based on those numbers it seems like men will cheat no matter how happy they are with their current partner meanwhile more women are cheating than ever according to a survey by the National Opinion Research Center women are 40 percent more likely to cheat than they were 20 years ago scientists partially attribute this to the increased presence of women in the workforce and the more successful the woman the more likely she is to cheat a University of Washington study found that women who earned $75,000 a year are 1.5 times more likely to cheat than those who are in less than $30,000 a year so to review scientists have found that these factors are the keys to why women cheat sexual and frequency lack of communication unhappiness in the relationship and a high level of success at work
