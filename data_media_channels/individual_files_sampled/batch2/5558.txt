forty years ago this month an American president took a risk bringing together the leaders of two historic bitter enemies for high stakes mission failure could have meant war and yet Jimmy Carter and his team orchestrated an enduring agreement the Camp David Accords a successful first step for a region that is still in need of brave diplomats like the ones back in 1978 war after war after war in the middle of the last century Egypt and Israel spent decades fighting over territory and security in 1978 Jimmy Carter an evangelical Christian and second year president put his prestige on the line a framework for peace in the Middle East Carter wrote long and personal letters to the Israeli and Egyptian heads of state begging the enemies to come to America and talk the challenge is tremendous they agreed setting the stage for a negotiation at the president's Wilderness residence Camp David at Camp David on a Maryland mountaintop almost never in our history has a president devoted so much time on a single problem Carter studied psychological profiles of the men prepared by the CIA and State Department prime minister beggin of Israel Menachem Bagan a conservative who led a militant group at the nation's outset had a loose grip on power president Sadat of Egypt Anwar Sadat described by the CIA as a former revolutionary an ardent nationalist known for his realism political acumen and capacity for surprising courageous and dramatic decisions with two fierce adversaries my father national security advisors big Nath Brzezinski advised the president you will have to control the proceedings from the outset Carter did just that at the request of President Carter beggin is making no political statements negotiating with each other and not through the press Carter's clamped down made what was happening inside a mystery to most reporters next to nothing of what they have said has got outside Camp David's barbed-wire fences the Israeli delegation is totally zipped up even less is coming out of it than is coming out at the Egyptian delegation well all the indications are that something's up but we don't know just what even Carter had no idea how long the talks would last nor did bagan or Sadat agree what was to come of them Sadat wanted Israeli troops out of the Sinai Peninsula and rights for Palestinians Bagan wanted simply to agree on principles for future negotiations Beckett and Sadat was so completely and personally incompatible they couldn't even be in the same room without exploding in anger so I kept them apart they never saw each other for ten days as Carter and his team socialized with the leaders each side got a better appreciation of what the other wanted they played talked ate together and prayed president Sadat of Egypt attended a Friday Muslim service at Camp David the Jewish Sabbath began at sundown which means Prime Minister Bagan won't be working on temporal affairs and President Carter will attend Baptist services at Camp David on Sunday morning dozens of American Israeli in Egyptian staffers and family members roamed Camp David's grounds I was there with the president's daughter Amy but diplomacy is no picnic even though it looked like it at times now as the summit begins its second week the advances made thus far might just simply evaporate the talks stalled over the dismantling of Israeli settlements they needed a break Carter brought them to Gettysburg to see a place where two sides would kill each other by the thousands and then ultimately reconcile to live in peace the three leaders were relaxed and jovial seeming to confirm reports from inside Camp David that the informal atmosphere there had brought them all closer together on the brink of failure Carter approached Bagan with a photograph which he inscribed with love to each of the Israeli Prime Minister's grandchildren Bagan was so moved by the gesture that he said they would try one more time the scene in the white last night was almost unbelievable the resulting deal removed Israeli troops from Sinai ended hostilities and opened the Suez Canal to the Israelis the risks were high but so what you determination let us promise each other that we should his treaty between the countries would not be signed for another six months documents ending a 30-year state of war between Israel and Egypt the photo-op was the finale not the beginning a time when American leadership and hard fought diplomacy led to an historic breakthrough on the world stage without any exaggeration what he did constitute one of the greatest achievements of our time in the face of adversity and hostility you have demonstrated the human value that can change history but what a remarkable remarkable piece of history and what a lesson to all of us still today let's bring in right now the 39th President of the United States President Jimmy Carter and mr. president 40 years later still no ground war in the Middle East that's extraordinary in itself but what do you believe are the greatest achievements of that time and and the legacy of the Camp David Accords well thank you this morning on is good to remember this 40 years ago what happened as a matter of fact not a single word of a treaty between Israel and Egypt has been violated during that for 40 years they still at ease although David agreement on they had been in war three times against each other and despised each other still because they could remember things that happened in the war and the people on both sides so it's very gratifying to me to remember back in those days and I hope that they all continued to be at ease but there were two basic elements of the Camp David Accords one was a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt it took about six months more negotiation between the two in which I was deeply involved the course the other part was to give the Palestinians full autonomy it is to manage their own affairs and ultimately we hope to have a nation of their own that hasn't been realized but I think the overall result of the Camp David Accords which has been very beneficial to both sides mr. president we could talk about the problems that the United States is is struggling through right now especially on the world stage but it seems to me focusing on what you did not only with the Camp David Accords but also we're going to be celebrating the 40th anniversary of your opening with China talk about how you did what you did at Camp David something that was seen as remarkable even then but even more so 40 years later the patience the the the preparation your own unique personal skills that kept these two bitter enemies together talking even through the toughest of time what do you say to young men and women that are listening this morning about what was required by you to make this happen well in my inaugural address and throughout my term as president I tried to do two things one is promote peace and the other was to be a champion of human rights on behalf of our country and I think that the living in peace is one of the basic human rights at all between Egypt I tried to promote peace with all nations in the world and we were pretty well successful in dealing with China as well I negotiated during the same year that is 1978 with a dunk shot ping and put the end of that year we announced the agreement that would establish peace between our two countries for the first time in more than 35 years I think of all the things that I did as president his own ization of relations with China was perhaps the most long had it's a long time effect on world affairs because China thinks it needs by done shopping then was reformed internally and also reach out to other nations around the world so China's now become a very big factor in international players and you know what's happened since they since they had free enterprise in China beginning a year after after we had agreements or with any other country so peace is prevailed in the Far East Pacific Ocean since that time although we had earlier they don't occur within the enamel or the career war in constant war so so I think that what success is welded and bringing peace to the world and I hope that we can maintain that peace you get along with our you know enemies that is in Egypt and also between the United States and China and mr. president looking at the challenges that you faced in Camp David you had to deal with menachem big and Anwar Sadat and also is big no boy which I understand can be a challenge so what was that like he was always a very wonderful experience for me he was he was completely loyal he was very knowledgeable and he was a driving force he was one of main ones who work directly with me alone once I've advanced to let me know what both sides wanted after they after the third day at camp they we had 13 days and all as you said earlier we never I never let them to get together back in Sudan stop with your packet pause while begging was asleep I would talk to Sadat and was asleep I would talk to pagan so I didn't get much sleep I think I lost about 15 pounds while I was in Camp David in 13 days and but but but I it was people like paczynski who to let me know what both sides wanted and so I could try to accommodate them what do you want for the Middle East over the next 40 years mr. president enjoyable life so that's one of the agreement said it's finally accepted and we can see indications we got back to Washington before the to back down on the Palestinian issue so I hope we can see my dream for that region come two days for Israel to live at peace with all its neighbors so that the Israelis and Palestinians and Egyptians and also President Jimmy Carter is so great to hear from you thank you very much for being on this morning thank you may have always been time to put your father's role of people ad campaign me too thank you very much and our thanks to the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum for their help and sharing some of that rare footage definitely brings back memories I just wanted to say to John Heilemann you you said or Myka even you sit there and you look at the patient's the President Carter showed you look as an assistance that he showed and also even before going there the preparation yeah that he showed in getting to know the men that he was going to be dealing with that is something that this White House and that is something that every White House should take to heart when trying to strike a deal are trying to understand either the Chinese or the North Koreans are the Israelis the Palestinians these diplomatic breakthroughs don't just happen because you call a meeting yeah this was extraordinarily difficult and that's the only way things happen it's not able I think I think what we just saw what we just talked about Camp David that is a blueprint for future leaders you now understand how to make things change for the better in the world my daughter did a paper on the Camp David Accords and interviewed my father right before he passed away and to hear about the preparation the psychological preparation alone it was incredible and then to be a kid of someone who was doing who was a part of that process I'm just sorry it was such a jerk I was 11 and I just you know you don't know what your parents are doing and Wow that was an incredible effort on the part of President Carter and his team well but one thing I'm talking about your behavior they're the one thing that President Carter has spoken about in the past but did not speak about today was the fact that you almost sidetracked an entire process by almost running over Monacan Bagan with the Gulf I just what were we doing there what we're doing there and and what exactly were you doing almost running over the not convey golf cart you know what from that important moment in history next we turn back into what's happening today in Washington in the world we'll be right back with more
