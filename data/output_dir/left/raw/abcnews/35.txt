00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,122
SAVED THOUSANDS OF LIVES.

190
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,558
THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE IN 

191
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,559
SYRIA, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT

192
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,294

AND MORE BROADLY THE ENTIRE 

196
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,938
GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO DEFEAT ISIS.

197
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,540
NOTHING IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT 

198
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,643
ALLIES AND PARTNERS, THOUGH.

199
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,578
MUCH WORK REMAINS TO ESTABLISH A

200
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,079
CLEAR VIEW OF THE NATURE OF OUR 

201
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:56,549
FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA.

202
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,017
HOW SHALL WE DEAL WITH ONE 

203
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,520
ANOTHER OVER THE NEXT 50 YEARS 

204
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,154
AND ENSURE A PERIOD OF 

205
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:04,590
PROSPERITY FOR ALL OF OUR

PEOPLES FREE OF CONFLICT BETWEEN

207
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,128
TWO VERY POWERFUL NATIONS.

208
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:10,963
AND MUCH WORK REMAINS TO RESPOND

209
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:12,965
TO THE TROUBLING BEHAVIOR AND 

210
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,501
ACTIONS ON THE PART OF THE 

211
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,536
RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT.

212
00:07:16,536 --> 00:07:20,540
RUSSIA MUST ASSESS CAREFULLY AS 

213
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,641
TO HOW ITS AX CTIONS ARE IN THE 

214
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,676

CONTINUING ON THEIR CURRENT 

218
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,549
TRAJECTORY IS LIKELY TO LEAD TO 

219
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,417
GREATER ISOLATION ON THEIR PART,

220
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,420
A SITUATION WHICH IS NOT IN 

221
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,555

00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,005
ABOUT AN ORDERLY TRANSITION.

262
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,539
WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THAT IS

263
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:02,742
THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED THE 

264
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,578
FIRING HIMSELF IN A TWEET AT 

265
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,013

00:09:08,013 --> 00:09:11,584
BEFORE GETTING ON A PLANE THIS 

267
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:11,817
MORNING.

268
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,387
>> REX TILLERSON AND I GOT ALONG

269
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,391
QUITE WELL BUT WE DISAGREED ON 

270
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:18,624
THINGS.

271
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:20,325
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE IRAN DEAL, 

272
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,527
I THOUGHT IT WAS TERRIBLE.

273
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:23,629
HE THINKS IT'S OKAY.

274
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,064
I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING AND HE 

275
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,765
FELT DIFFERENTLY.

276
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,799
SO WE WERE NOT REALLY THINKING 

277
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,500
THE SAME.

278
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,336
WITH MIKE POMPEO, WE HAVE A VERY

279
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:31,203
SIMILAR THOUGHT PROCESS.

280
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:33,873
I THINK IT'S GOING TO GO VERY 

281
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:34,073
WELL.

282
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,741
REX IS A VERY GOOD MAN, I LIKE 

283
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,143

I'LL BE SPEAKING TO REX OVER A 

287
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,548

TELLING HIM.

300
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:09,875
>> AND THAT WAS JUST BEFORE HE 

301
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,077
TRAVELED TO CALIFORNIA.

302
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:13,645
MAKE NO BONES, THERE IS BAD 

303
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,180
BLOOD BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN AND 

304
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,549
IT IS LONGSTANDING.

305
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,416
THEY HAVE NOT BEEN HAPPY WITH 

306
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:18,684
EACH OTHER.

307
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,520
THE PRESIDENT SAID IRAN HAD A 

308
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,523
DEAL WITH PRESIDENT KIM JONG-UN.

309
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,058
SECRETARY TILLERSON USED THE 

310
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,327
WORD MORON TO DESCRIBE PRESIDENT

311
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:28,527
TRUMP.

312
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,496
THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING.

313
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,031
THE FACT THAT IT HAPPENED NOW IS

314
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,032
A COMPLETE SURPRISE.

315
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:34,500
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CHAOS 

316
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,701
INVOLVING THIS WHITE HOUSE RIGHT

317
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,435
NOW.

318
00:10:36,435 --> 00:10:37,903
THIS IS NOW THE SEVENTH SENIOR 

319
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,171
ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL TO LEAVE

320
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,573
THIS WHITE HOUSE THIS YEAR 

321
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:40,773
ALONE.

322
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:41,907
AND THE PRESIDENT JUST SAID IN 

323
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,809
RECENT DAYS THAT HE LIKES TO SEE

324
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:44,276
COMPETING VOICES.

325
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,278
WE ARE NOW SEEING THE SECOND 

326
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,113
VERY HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL 

327
00:10:48,113 --> 00:10:51,784
INSIDE THAT WHITE HOUSE TO LEAVE

328
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,352
GARY CO HEN, THE CHIEF ECONOMIC 

329
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:59,492
ADVISER, OUT JUST A FEW MOMENTS 

330
00:10:59,492 --> 00:10:59,658
AGO.

331
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:02,060
>> AND THIS COMES BEFORE THE 

332
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,062
MEETING WITH KIM JONG-UN OF 

333
00:11:04,062 --> 00:11:04,497
NORTH KOREA.

334
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,599
THE SECRETARY OF STATE CLEARLY 

335
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:07,733
BLINDSIDED BY THE PRESIDENT'S 

336
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,568
DECISION TO SEEK A SUMMIT LAST 

337
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,303
WEEK, EVEN THOUGH HE HAD BEEN 

338
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,172
ARGUING FOR TALKS FOR MANY 

339
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,740
MONTHS BEFORE WITH KIM JONG-UN 

340
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,142
AND BEEN SHOT DOWN BY THE 

341
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:16,542
PRESIDENT.

342
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:18,043
>> HE HAD BEEN SHOT DOWN IN 

343
00:11:18,043 --> 00:11:20,379
ABOUT 48 HOURS BEFORE THE 

344
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,214
PRESIDENT ACCEPTED THAT SUMMIT.

345
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:25,251
REX TILLERSON SAID IT WASN'T THE

346
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,651
TIME FOR NEGOTIATIONS, SO HE HAD

347
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:28,653
TO BACKTRACK WITH THAT STATEMENT

348
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:29,221
AS WELL.

349
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,390
THINK ABOUT THE DAY THAT REX 

350
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,292
TILLERSON HAS HAD TODAY.

351
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,761
HE ARRIVED BACK IN WASHINGTON, 

352
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,532
D.C. AT 4:00 A.M. THIS MORNING.

353
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,167
HOURS LATER THE PRESIDENT TWEETS

354
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,000
THAT HE IS FIRED.

355
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,103
IF HE SOUNDED A LITTLE BIT 

356
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:45,971
WINDED AND EMOTIONAL IN THAT 

357
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,406
STATEMENT, IT IS BECAUSE I'M 

358
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,175
SURE HE IS EXHAUSTED, AND AS YOU

359
00:11:49,175 --> 00:11:51,544
BOTH SAID, HE HAS BEEN 

360
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,711
BLINDSIDED BY THIS DECISION.

361
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,815
ALTHOUGH HE CERTAINLY HAD A HINT

362
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,382
ABOUT THAT.

363
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,950
AT THE END OF LAST YEAR, THERE 

364
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,651
WAS A LOT OF TALK THAT REX 

365
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,353
TILLERSON WAS ON HIS WAY OUT 

366
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:02,221
AFTER IT WAS REPORTED 

367
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,589
PARTICULARLY THAT HE HAD SAID IN

368
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,891
PRIVATE THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS A

369
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,091
MORON.

370
00:12:06,091 --> 00:12:07,960
THERE WAS MUCH TALK THAT HE 

371
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,894
WOULD BE OUT THE DOOR.

372
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,462
THE PRESIDENT DENIED THAT IN A 

373
00:12:10,462 --> 00:12:11,730
TWEET, SAID IT WASN'T GOING TO 

374
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,131
HAPPEN.

375
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,432
BUT WE HAVE IT TODAY AND A BIG 

376
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:14,867
SURPRISE.

377
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,768
>> AND THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO 

378
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:18,036
ANNOUNCING THE FIRING OF THE 

379
00:12:18,036 --> 00:12:19,939
NUMBER 4 OFFICIAL, 

380
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,373
UNDERSECRETARY STEVE GOLDSTEIN, 

381
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,141
WHO HAD PUT OUT STATEMENT SAYING

382
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,876
THAT REX TILLERSON HADN'T BEEN 

383
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:24,676
CALLED BY THE PRESIDENT.

384
00:12:24,676 --> 00:12:27,179
AT LEAST TO THE BROADER QUESTION

385
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,413
ABOUT THE WHOLE FOREIGN POLICY 

386
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,216
TEAM AT THIS POINT, THE STAFFING

387
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,183
IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND IN 

388
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,186
THE FOREIGN SERVICE, AND WHETHER

389
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:35,387
THE ADMINISTRATION HAS THE TEAM 

390
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,489
IN PLACE TO PREPARE FOR THIS 

391
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:38,557
SUMMIT WITH NORTH KOREA.

392
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,160
>> AND THAT'S THE QUESTION, 

393
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,461
GEORGE, THE STATE DEPARTMENT.

394
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,430
THERE ARE SO MANY UNFILLED 

395
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:44,697
POSITIONS.

396
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,865
THERE IS NO AMBASSADOR TO SOUTH 

397
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:48,100
KOREA RIGHT NOW, ALTHOUGH THERE 

398
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,503
IS A VERY CAPABLE NUMBER 2 IN 

399
00:12:51,503 --> 00:12:52,938
CHARGE THERE IN SEOUL.

400
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,542
BUT THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND 

401
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,943
STEVE GOLDSTEIN TODAY FIRED.

402
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,645
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THE

403
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,746
STATE DEPARTMENT SO SUDDENLY, 

404
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,081
AND THIS IS THE STATEMENT HE 

405
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:02,948
MADE.

406
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,351
HE IS THE UNDERSECRETARY OR WAS 

407
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,353
THE UNDERSECRETARY OF STATE FOR 

408
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:07,653
DIPLOMACY.

409
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:08,753
THE SECRETARY HAD EVERY 

410
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,823
INTENTION OF STAYING BECAUSE OF 

411
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:14,359
THE CRITICAL PROGRESS MADE IN 

412
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:15,861
NATIONAL SECURITY.

413
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:16,895
THE SECRETARY DID NOT SPEAK TO 

414
00:13:16,895 --> 00:13:19,331
THE PRESIDENT AND IS UNAWARE OF 

415
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,566
THE REASON HE WAS FIRED, AND 

416
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:23,802
WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS, THE 

417
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,805
MAN WHO PUT THAT STATEMENT OUT, 

418
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:27,506
FIRED.

419
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,407
>> ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE 

420
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,242
SEEING RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW IS 

421
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:31,109
SOMETHING THE PRESIDENT WANTED 

422
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:31,777
TO DO.

423
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:32,978
HE WANTED TO MEET WITH KIM 

424
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,079
JONG-UN OF NORTH KOREA.

425
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,514
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO DO IT 

426
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,716
DESPITE THE ADVICE OF HIS 

427
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:37,949
EXPERTS.

428
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:42,888
AND MIKE POMPEO, DIRECTOR OF THE

429
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:44,256
CIA, IN AS SECRETARY OF STATE.

430
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:46,324
THAT'S WHAT HE DID.

431
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,193
>> AND HE SAID HE WAS ON THE WAY

432
00:13:48,193 --> 00:13:50,429
TO GETTING HIS CABINET EXACTLY 

433
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,865
THE MAKEUP HE WANTS IT TO BE.

434
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:54,032
WE KNOW FROM SOURCES ON THE 

435
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:55,167
OUTSIDE THAT STILL TALK TO 

436
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,702
PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE THAT 

437
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,203
PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BECOME 

438
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,939
INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND HE IS 

439
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:00,539
INCREASINGLY ANGRY.

440
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,873
YOU'VE GOT TO WONDER IF THIS IS 

441
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:03,075
A RESULT OF THE EMOTION THE 

442
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:03,909
PRESIDENT IS FEELING RIGHT NOW.

443
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,111
>> UPCOMING HEARINGS NOW FROM 

444
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,480
MIKE POMPEO TO BE SECRETARY OF 

445
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,680
STATE.

446
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,483
ALSO GINA HASPEL, CAREER CIA 

447
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:12,684
OFFICER, HAS NOW BEEN 

448
00:14:12,684 --> 00:14:13,752
APPOINTED -- NOMINATED TO BE 

449
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:15,521
HEAD OF THE CIA, THE FIRST WOMAN

450
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,755
TO LEAD THE CIA.

451
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,056
>> SHE IS THE FIRST WOMAN TO 

452
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:20,459
LEAD THE CIA, AND WITHIN THE 

453
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,860
CIA, I THINK SHE IS VERY WELL 

454
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,161
LIKED.

455
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,428
THERE WILL BE MANY QUESTIONS 

456
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:26,131
ABOUT HER PAST IN 2002.

457
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,967
SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF ONE OF 

458
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,101
THOSE SO-CALLED BLACK SITES 

459
00:14:29,101 --> 00:14:31,403
WHERE THEY DID ENHANCED 

460
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,571
INTERROGATION AND ALSO WITH THE 

461
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,106
DESTRUCTION OF THE TAPES FROM 

462
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:35,374
THAT, SO SHE WILL FACE QUESTIONS

463
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:35,674
ABOUT THAT.

464
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,076
>> THERE YOU HAVE IT.

465
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,977
