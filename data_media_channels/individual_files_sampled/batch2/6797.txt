FoxNews desperately wants no action whatsoever and gun control in the wake of this most recent school shooting but at the same time they also want to look like they're at least sort of taking seriously this constant ritualized mass murder of our children and so they need to find something to talk about and something to blame and they've decided to go back to I believe the 90s maybe the early 2000s for something else to put the blame on and you're gonna see that in this clip how about video games Ethan would you support regulating video games you know there are video games out there that are very realistic and you can shoot to deaths you know every video character on the screen and leave them lying in a pool of blood well I think that's a much more challenging issue because that gets into parenting and great greater social issues because how do you regulate video games whereas a handgun you can control the flow of them Germany did it very successfully after a series of school shootings in Germany they have a I'm gonna go around check before you get your permit Ethan how many guns were already on in society in Germany they don't have kind of the tradition that they actually very high they have a very high gun ownership rate Finland is another one that put in the same system Switzerland is a very high gun ownership rate again where the society has chosen to allow the government to be more intrusive if you're gonna have a deadly weapon in your hands the key is is to make it more difficult to rapidly kill a large number of people in a very short period of time I call for banning bump stocks immediately let's remove high-capacity magazines immediately at least make it easy look I fired ar-15 I have a dd-214 from the Army Reserve I've fired I've gone skeet shooting I've gone hunting I know what it's like to use firearms there is a rational basis to limit what is available so that's a radio host even Biermann and he's a former Army reservist and he served and etc so he is you can't say he doesn't know anything about weapons and what he's asking for is not that much he's like bum stalks allow you to shoot turn those weapons into automatic weapons why high-capacity magazines if you're a hunter or you need to protect your house why is there a marauding army of Huns who are gonna come into your house and you really need to fire at that kind of pace is there a an Afghani warlord coming to your suburbs to do harm to your you and your family no there's no reason to have those other than to the killings now to the incredibly misinformed idea that John Scott the Fox News host they're put out about video games I want to quote the New York Times from a story from yesterday that looked at different studies of what causes gun related deaths of mass shootings whether a population plays more or fewer video games also appears to have no impact Americans are no more likely to play video games than people in any other developed country so for example in Japan they play a lot of video games let me show you the stats on Japan gun related deaths in Japan versus us in the year 2013 we had twenty one thousand one hundred and seventy five suicides from guns eleven thousand two hundred eight homicides from guns and just five hundred five people died from accidents from guns accidental discharge in Japan there were thirteen gun related deaths but they don't play video games there right yeah and now let's be fair yeah we're three times as large as Japan so let's call that thirty nine just on accidents alone we overwhelm them you know why you can't accidentally kill yourself with a gun if you don't have one I mean I think that's the point night note John Scott and I think he's a great journalist but he's just wrong on this particular point because you could play video games with you're blue in the face if you don't actually if you can't get access to an ar-15 then it doesn't matter and I think the pre I'm gonna bring up the previous point that I made earlier on this segment was the Huffington Post right after the pulse nightclub shooting which wasn't that long ago right went into Orlando and they had one of their journalists try to purchase an ar-15 it took him 38 minutes to walk out of a gun shop with an ar-15 a military grade weapon these are not weapons that you see it's not like it's the basically it was as much time to take you to go buy a rotisserie chicken at your local Whole Foods you can go buy an ar-15 in the state of Florida they really should rename the place but instead of the Sunshine State the gun shine state because it's so easy to get a gun and the rules are so lacks and there's no stop measures there's no stop gaps in Florida medical professionals can't even ask you if you own a gun if you're mentally deranged like they can't ask because they could lose their license for asking you are infringe upon your second Amendment right and it goes back to the fact that the NRA and it's infuriate Smee how much power this one random building in Fairfax has over the entire country they literally have America by the throat yeah right it is they really America let me be very clear they have Republican politicians by the throat and so they are so afraid of getting scored by the NRA or by like the 33% of NRA activists and what they're willing to do that they will not stand up for the safety of our children and so what that says to me we are what a couple months away from an election if you have a kid in public schools you need to vote for your kids safety whether you are Democrat whether you're Republican whether you are independent vote for your children and vote these bozos out of office because they are afraid of a building in Fairfax and their fear is causing our kids to die period yeah the only part I disagree with of course is that it's not random they bribed these politicians yes they pay them yes and Donald Trump got thirty million dollars from the NRA in the last race and Marco Rubio has gotten 3.3 million dollars over the course of his career from the NRA so when he says all he has his thoughts and prayers got for real yeah that's because he got paid to say that you just watch the video by the young turks home of the revolution if you'd like to get a lot more than that get the full show by becoming a member TYT Network comm slash join
