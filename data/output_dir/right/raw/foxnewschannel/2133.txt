1
00:00:00,307 --> 00:00:03,811
OUTRAGEOUS ACCUSATION THAT HE

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:05,913
INCITED A DEADLY ATTACK ON A

3
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:06,246
MOSQUE.

4
00:00:06,246 --> 00:00:10,317
BUT WE BEGIN WITH NBC WALKING

5
00:00:10,317 --> 00:00:12,286
BACK ITS BIG STORY TODAY, THAT

6
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,787
THE FEDS HAD WIRETAPPED THE

7
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:15,956
PHONES OF THE PRESIDENT'S

8
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:17,825
PERSONAL ATTORNEY MICHAEL COHEN.

9
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:20,961
THE STORY NOW HAS A LENGTHY

10
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:24,131
CORRECTION ON TOP SAYING THAT

11
00:00:24,264 --> 00:00:30,637
THAT REPORT, BUT THE CORRECTION

12
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:33,173
EXPLAINS THAT THEY WERE

13
00:00:33,173 --> 00:00:34,408
MONITORED BUT NOT WIRETAPPED.

14
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:35,409
AND INVESTIGATORS DIDN'T

15
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:39,079
ACTUALLY LISTEN TO HIS CALLS.

16
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,048
WELL, FOX NEWS HAS CONFIRMED

17
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:44,284
THAT AT LEAST ONE OF HIS PHONES

18
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:45,185
RECORDS PHONE NUMBERS DIALED AND

19
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:45,619

33
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,701
REPORTS SAME, WE THINK IT'S

34
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:02,603
UNTRUE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

35
00:01:02,603 --> 00:01:03,437
TOTALLY ILLEGAL.

36
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:07,007
DISCLOSING A WIRETAP IS ITSELF A

37
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:07,908
FEDERAL FELONY.

38
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:11,111
ALL OF THIS CAME AFTER GIULIANI

39
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:11,845
EMPHASIZED THAT THE TRUMP TEAM

40
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,947
WILL KNOW LONGLEY COMIC MONGERS

41
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:18,819
SIT IDLY BY WHILE MUELLER'S

42
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,255
INVESTIGATION CREEPS INTO EVERY

43
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:22,389
ASPECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S LIFE.

44
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:24,424
>> THIS STARTED WITH THE

45
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:25,359
COLLUSION OF THE RUSSIANS.

46
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,093
NO.

47
00:01:26,093 --> 00:01:28,428
NOW THEY GO TO OBSTRUCTION OF

48
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:29,363
JUSTICE, COLLUSION AMONG THE

49
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:30,030
PLAYERS.

50
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,265
WHAT THEY ARE REALLY TRYING TO

51
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:35,435
DO IS TRAP THEM INTO PERJURY AND

52
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:37,137
WE ARE NOT SUCKERS.

53
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,273
>> Laura: LET'S GET INTO

54
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,140
TODAY'S DEVELOPMENTS WITH

55
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,075
WHITE HOUSE SECRETARY ARI

56
00:01:42,075 --> 00:01:46,313
FLEISCHER, AND A FORMER FEC

57
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:47,014
CHAIRMAN, BRADLEY SMITH.

58
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:48,615
GUYS, WE HAVE SO MUCH TO GET

59
00:01:48,615 --> 00:01:49,016
THROUGH.

60
00:01:49,016 --> 00:01:51,952
I WANT TO GO TO YOU FIRST,

61
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:52,286
BRADLEY.

62
00:01:52,286 --> 00:01:56,657
THERE WAS A MOMENT DURING THE

63
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,425
INTERVIEW THIS MORNING WITH RUDY

64
00:01:58,425 --> 00:01:59,826
GIULIANI, WHERE HE AGAIN

65
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:01,061
REITERATED THAT THIS WAS NOT A

66
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:04,398
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION, AND THEN

67
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:05,799
HE ADDED ANOTHER THOUGHT THAT

68
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,100
SEEM TO CONTRADICT THE FIRST

69
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,434
THOUGHT.

70
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,303
LET'S WATCH.

71
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,872
>> IF WE HAD TO DEFEND THIS AS

72
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:12,673
NOT BEING IT CAMPAIGN

73
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:14,041
CONTRIBUTION, I THINK WE COULD

74
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:14,608
DO THIS.

75
00:02:14,608 --> 00:02:16,143
THIS WAS FOR PERSONAL REASONS,

76
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:18,078
THIS WAS THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN

77
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,480
HURT PERSONALLY, NOT POLITICALLY

78
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,448
HURT PERSONALLY, NOT POLITICALL

79
00:02:21,448 --> 00:02:21,848
POLITICALLY.

80
00:02:21,848 --> 00:02:24,117
AND THE FIRST LADY, BY SOME OF

81
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:27,421
THE FOLKS' ALLEGATIONS.

82
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:28,121
THAT ONE FALSE ALLEGATION WAS

83
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,823
SIX YEARS OLD, AND I THINK HE

84
00:02:29,823 --> 00:02:31,792
WAS TRYING TO HELP THE FAMILY.

85
00:02:31,792 --> 00:02:32,693
FOR THAT, THE MAN IS BEING

86
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:34,561
TREATED LIKE SOME KIND OF

87
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,296
VILLAIN AND I THINK HE WAS JUST

88
00:02:36,296 --> 00:02:37,431
BEING A GOOD LAWYER.

89
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:41,034
IMAGINE IF THAT CAME OUT ON

90
00:02:41,034 --> 00:02:41,802
OCTOBER 15, 2016, AND THE MIDDLE

91
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:43,937
OF THE LAST DEBATE WITH

92
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:44,404
HILLARY CLINTON.

93
00:02:44,404 --> 00:02:47,007
>> SO TO MAKE IT GO AWAY, CALL

94
00:02:47,007 --> 00:02:49,910
ME MADE IT GO AWAY, HE DID HIS

95
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,812
JOB.

96
00:02:51,812 --> 00:02:53,814
>> Laura: BRADLEY, DO YOU SEE

97
00:02:53,814 --> 00:02:55,115
MY POINT THERE, IT WAS ALL

98
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:57,217
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.

99
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:58,085
WHETHER IT WAS THREE WEEKS

100
00:02:58,085 --> 00:02:59,920
BEFORE THE ELECTION OR TWO WEEKS

101
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,823
BEFORE THE ELECTION, I WASN'T

102
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:03,790
QUITE GETTING THAT PARTICULAR

103
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,091
POINT.

104
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:04,691
AND WHETHER IT MAKES A

105
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:08,862
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF ANY SEC

106
00:03:08,862 --> 00:03:10,831
VIOLATIONS.

107
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:13,233
SPEAK TO WRITE, I DON'T KNOW

108
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,735
EXACTLY WHAT RUDY WAS THINKING,

109
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:17,037
BUT THE BASIC LAW ON THIS IS,

110
00:03:17,037 --> 00:03:19,006
MANY THINGS THAT CAN INFLUENCE A

111
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,607
CAMPAIGN OR NOT IT CAMPAIGN

112
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:21,041
EXPENDITURES.

113
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,075
SO IF THE CANDIDATE THINKS, I

114
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:24,244
WOULD LOOK GREAT IN THAT NEW

115
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:27,381
SUIT, HE MIGHT SPEND $1800 ON A

116
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,216
SUIT, BUT IT'S NOT A CAMPAIGN

117
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:29,850
EXPENDITURE.

118
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,019
IF HE THINKS, I WOULD DO BETTER

119
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:35,055
ON THIS GRUELING CAMPAIGN, IF I

120
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:36,256
HAD A WEEK AT MARTHA'S VINEYARD

121
00:03:36,256 --> 00:03:38,625
FIRST, NOT A CAMPAIGN

122
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,192
EXPENDITURE, PERSONAL

123
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:39,593
EXPENDITURE.

124
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:41,294
THE RULE ON THIS IS NOT THAT

125
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:42,429
SOMETHING RELATED TO THE

126
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,631
CAMPAIGN IS A CAMPAIGN

127
00:03:44,631 --> 00:03:45,565
EXPENDITURE, IT'S SOMETHING

128
00:03:45,565 --> 00:03:48,502
RELATED TO THE CAMPAIGN AS A

129
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:49,970
CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE.

130
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,670
THE SEC REJECTED THOSE.

131
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,005
THAT HAS TO BE AN OBLIGATION

132
00:03:52,005 --> 00:03:54,441
THAT WOULD NOT EXIST BUT FOR THE

133
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:54,808
CAMPAIGN.

134
00:03:54,808 --> 00:03:56,743
I THINK THERE IS A STRONG

135
00:03:56,743 --> 00:03:58,478
ARGUMENT AT LEAST FROM WHAT WE

136
00:03:58,478 --> 00:03:59,513
KNOW PUBLICLY WHERE TRUMP WOULD

137
00:03:59,513 --> 00:04:01,882
HAVE SAID, WE WOULD HAVE MADE

138
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:02,549
THESE PAYMENTS.

139
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,884
CELEBRITIES WOULD HAVE MADE

140
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,452
THESE KINDS OF PAYMENTS.

141
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:07,020
HE WOULD HAVE REASONS LIKE,

142
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,587
PROTECTING HIS FAMILY,

143
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:11,425
PROTECTING HIS COMMERCIAL

144
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:12,392
VIABILITY, NOT WANTING THE

145
00:04:12,392 --> 00:04:12,793
DISTRACTION.

146
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:15,328
ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT MIGHT

147
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:20,367
HAVE MADE HIM WANT TO DO IT.

148
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,134
THEY HAVE MADE SIMILAR PAYMENTS

149
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:23,136
IN THE PAST, AND EVEN STORMY

150
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:24,638
DANIELS IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE HER

151
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:25,639
SAID IN HER "60 MINUTES"

152
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:29,643
INTERVIEW THAT IT IS AS FAR BACK

153
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,645
AS 2011 SHE WAS TOLD NOT TO SAY

154
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:33,814
ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, SUGGESTING

155
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,248
THAT LONG BEFORE HE WAS A

156
00:04:35,248 --> 00:04:35,982
CANDIDATE THEY WANTED TO KEEP

157
00:04:35,982 --> 00:04:36,983
THIS QUIET.

158
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,287
I THINK THERE'S A VERY STRONG

159
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:43,356
ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS NOT A

160
00:04:43,356 --> 00:04:48,228
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION, WHETHER

161
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:48,829
COHEN PAID IT AND TRUMP

162
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:52,699
REIMBURSED HIM OR WHAT, BUT IT'S

163
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:53,834
NOT A CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE.

164
00:04:53,834 --> 00:04:54,501
>> Laura: DOES IT ALL GO TO

165
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,204
THE STATE OF MIND OF

166
00:04:57,204 --> 00:04:59,039
DONALD TRUMP, WHEN HE WAS

167
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,040
REIMBURSING, DURING WHAT TIME

168
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,275
FRAME, IS NOT RELEVANT HERE TO

169
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,443
LOOK AT THIS?

170
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,077
BECAUSE AWAY BRADLEY JUST

171
00:05:04,077 --> 00:05:06,012
DESCRIBED IT, I COMPLETELY

172
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:06,646
UNDERSTAND THAT.

173
00:05:06,646 --> 00:05:08,815
BUT THE WAY OF COURSE IT'S BEING

174
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:09,483
REPORTED ACROSS MOST MEDIA

175
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:12,486
TODAY, IT IS BURNED DOWN THE

176
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:13,987
HOUSE KIND OF STUFF.

177
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:16,623
YOUR REACTION?

178
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:17,824
>> Bradley: WELL I WOULD NEVER

179
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:20,160
BURN DOWN THE HOUSE FOR THIS

180
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,796
KIND OF CAMPAIGN LAW VIOLATION,

181
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:23,630
ASSUMING IT IS ONE.

182
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:26,833
THIS IS NOT THE CRIME OF THE

183
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,801
CENTURY, ITS RELATIVELY SMALL

184
00:05:27,801 --> 00:05:28,168
POTATOES.

185
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:30,237
BRADLEY IS MORE OF AN EXPERT ON

186
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:31,204
THE ELECTION LAW THAN I AM AND I

187
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:34,040
ALWAYS THOUGHT THE TEST WAS, IS

188
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,009
IT FOR THE PURPOSE OF

189
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:36,810
INFLUENCING THE CAMPAIGN?

190
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,446
SO IT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION IF YOU

191
00:05:39,446 --> 00:05:41,314
DO SOMETHING 11 DAYS BEFORE THE

192
00:05:41,314 --> 00:05:43,483
CAMPAIGN, BUT IT'S RELATIVELY A

193
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:44,017
FACT QUESTION.

194
00:05:44,017 --> 00:05:46,253
AND BY NO MEANS WOULD BE EASY TO

195
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:46,653
PROVE.

196
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:48,755
BUT AGAIN, IN THE GRAND SCHEME

197
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:50,257
OF THINGS, IT'S RELATIVELY

198
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:50,557
MINOR.

199
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:52,459
I CAN'T IMAGINE ANY PRESIDENT

200
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:53,660
BEING IMPEACHED, MUCH LESS

201
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,763
PROSECUTED FOR A FELONY FOR

202
00:05:56,763 --> 00:05:57,063
THAT.

203
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:58,732
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT

204
00:05:58,732 --> 00:06:00,033
RUDY ISN'T REALLY TALKING ABOUT

205
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:01,535
IT IN A VERY INTELLIGENT WAY AND

206
00:06:01,535 --> 00:06:02,269
THAT IT'S VERY DANGEROUS TO GO

207
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:06,806
ON TELEVISION AND START TALKING

208
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,975
ABOUT WHAT YOUR CLIENT SAID AND

209
00:06:08,975 --> 00:06:09,276
DID.

00:06:16,683 --> 00:06:18,885
ABOUT THIS WIRETAP ISSUE.

221
00:06:18,885 --> 00:06:19,186
WATCH.

222
00:06:19,186 --> 00:06:21,922

THE PRESIDENT'S LAWYER.

233
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,440
YOU GET THE SAME TREATMENT I DO,

234
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,875
YOU GO TO THE JUDGE AND SAY, I

235
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,945
WANT TO LISTEN TO HIS PHONE.

236
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,646
>> WELL IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT

237
00:06:46,646 --> 00:06:48,248
DIDN'T HAPPEN AND YOU WONDER WHY

238
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:50,083
PEOPLE CALL IT FAKE NEWS.

239
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:50,817
THEY WERE POSITIVELY JUBILANT

240
00:06:50,817 --> 00:06:53,253
ALL DAY, LIKE WE WILL HAVE THE

241
00:06:53,253 --> 00:06:59,192
RECORDINGS, WE WILL BE ABLE TO

242
00:06:59,192 --> 00:07:00,093
THE SPECULATION ABOUT WHAT THE

243
00:07:00,093 --> 00:07:01,761
CONVERSATION MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF

244
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:03,697
TRUMP ACTUALLY HAD A

245
00:07:03,697 --> 00:07:07,033
CONVERSATION, I HAVE NEVER HEARD

246
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:07,767
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

247
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:09,836
YOUR REACTION TO THIS MEDIA

248
00:07:09,836 --> 00:07:15,809
FEEDING FRENZY?

249
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:16,543
>> Ari: THE WHOLE DIRECTION OF

250
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:18,478
THE PRESS HAS BEEN BLAMING

251
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,648
DONALD TRUMP FOR EVERYTHING.

252
00:07:21,648 --> 00:07:22,849
WHEN NBC HEARS ABOUT SOMETHING

253
00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:23,950
LIKE THIS, THEY HAVEN'T

254
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,585
EXPLAINED HOW AND WHY THEY GOT

255
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:28,154
IT WRONG.

256
00:07:28,154 --> 00:07:35,128
THEY RUN WITH IT AND, CNN, MSNBC

257
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,463
AND CBS HAVE NEVER EXPLAINED HOW

258
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:38,765
THEY PUT A STORY ON THE AIR

259
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:41,034
SAYING MULTIPLE SOURCES READ A

260
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:42,235
MEMO SAYING THAT

261
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:44,037
DONALD TRUMP JR. HAD ADVANCED

262
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:44,838
NOTICE OF THE WIKILEAKS.

263
00:07:44,838 --> 00:07:45,538
NOW THEY HAVE TO RETRACT THAT

264
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:48,241
BECAUSE A PERSON READING THE

265
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:48,942
MEMO GOT A DATE WRONG AND THE

266
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:53,013
NOTICE WAS AFTER THE WIKILEAKS

267
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:53,380
WAS AIRED.

268
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,682
BUT THEY NEVER EXPLAIN HOW THEY

269
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,517
POSSIBLY ALL COULD HAVE HAD

270
00:07:57,517 --> 00:07:58,685
MULTIPLE SOURCES GETTING THAT

271
00:07:58,685 --> 00:07:59,352
STORY WRONG BECAUSE THIS

272
00:07:59,352 --> 00:08:01,288
THRESHOLD IS SO LOW FOR

273
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:02,422
ANTI-TRUMP STORIES.

274
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:03,957
AND IT'S HURTING JOURNALISM,

275
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,760
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS AMERICA

276
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,762
SPLITTING INTO TWO, FRANKLY.

277
00:08:08,762 --> 00:08:10,130
YOU HAVE THOSE WHO DON'T BELIEVE

278
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,831
THE PRESS AND OTHERS WHO HATE

279
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:12,265
DONALD TRUMP.

280
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:13,333
IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR THE

281
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,234
COUNTRIES WHO HAVE THE PRESS GET

282
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,236
IT WRONG.

283
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:17,671
>> Laura: AND BY THE WAY, THE

284
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,640
ATTORNEY FOR STORMY DANIELS WAS

285
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,042
INVITED ON THE SHOW BUT HE

286
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:22,509
DECLINED.

287
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:24,511
HE WAS ALSO OUT THERE SAYING,

288
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:28,114
THIS IS A FACT.

289
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:29,482
I NOTICED THEY ARE TREATING HIM

290
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:33,720
LIKE HE'S JUST AN OBJECTIVE

291
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,221
ANALYST, WHETHER IT'S ABOUT THE

292
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:37,691
LAW OR WHAT HAPPENED.

293
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,893
HE KEEPS SAYING, IT'S A FACT.

294
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:40,592
AND YOU SEE THESE JOURNALISTS

295
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:42,629
STROKING THEIR CHIN, IT'S A

296
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:42,929
FACT.

297
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,831
OF COURSE IT WASN'T A FACT, IT

298
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:45,565
WASN'T A FACT, IT WAS IN EFFECT

299
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:48,134
AT ALL.

300
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:52,906
>> Ari: THEY TREAT HIM THE WAY

301
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:57,844
THEY TREATED ADAM "PRESS PLAY"

302
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:59,045
SHIFT.

303
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:01,181
THEY HAVE NO CYNICAL TOUGH

304
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:01,648
QUESTIONS ASKED.

305
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,016
>> Laura: I WANT TO GO TO YOU

306
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:05,385
ON THIS OTHER DEVELOPER THAT WE

307
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:05,819
LEARNED TODAY.

308
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:10,690
THE EMAIL THAT MICHAEL COHEN

309
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,292
USED TOO I GUESS FACILITATE OR

310
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:12,992
FINALIZE THE DEAL WITH THE

311
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:22,302
PAYMENT TO DANIEL, WAS A

312
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:22,769
Trump.org EMAIL.

313
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:25,138
DOES NOT HAVE ANY BEARING ON

314
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:25,905
THIS CASE AND WILL NOT BE LOOKED

315
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:26,606
AT BY MUELLER, WHO WE KNOW --

316
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:27,407
AND WE WILL GET INTO THIS IN THE

317
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:30,877
NEXT SEGMENT -- WE KNOW CAN BE

318
00:09:30,877 --> 00:09:31,678
OVERZEALOUS AND PUSHES THE

319
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,012
BOUNDARIES OF THE LAW TO GET

320
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:33,947
SOMETHING HE WANTS.

321
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:38,151
IT'S NOT FIRST TIME IT'S

322
00:09:38,151 --> 00:09:38,518
HAPPENED.

323
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:40,620
WE SAW THAT WITH THE BLOOD GOYA

324
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:46,493
VEG CASE.

325
00:09:46,493 --> 00:09:48,828
SPIVAK OF COURSE, I CAN'T SAY

326
00:09:48,828 --> 00:09:50,130
WHAT MUELLER WILL DO.

327
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,365
BUT IF IT'S NOT A CAMPAIGN

328
00:09:52,365 --> 00:09:54,334
EXPENDITURE, IF IT WASN'T AN

329
00:09:54,334 --> 00:09:56,436
OBLIGATION THAT WOULD NOT HAVE

330
00:09:56,436 --> 00:09:58,571
EXISTED BUT FOR THE CAMPAIGN,

331
00:09:58,571 --> 00:09:59,472
THEN IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW IT

332
00:09:59,472 --> 00:10:03,243
WAS PAID.

333
00:10:03,243 --> 00:10:04,711
IT WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM

334
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:05,745
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

335
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,147
IN FACT THIS IS ONE OF THE

336
00:10:07,147 --> 00:10:07,847
PROBLEMS.

337
00:10:07,847 --> 00:10:09,783
IMAGINE IF THE TRUMP FOLKS HAD

338
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,818
PAID FOR THIS WITH CAMPAIGN

339
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,787
FUNDS AND REPORTED THIS AS A

340
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:14,387
CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE.

341
00:10:14,387 --> 00:10:15,955
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU, AND YOU CAN

342
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:19,392
BET THE FARM, THEY WOULD HAVE

343
00:10:19,392 --> 00:10:21,494
FILED COMPLAINTS ALLEGING THAT

344
00:10:21,494 --> 00:10:22,862
THIS WAS AN ILLEGAL DIVERSION OF

345
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,564
CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR PERSONAL USE,

346
00:10:24,564 --> 00:10:25,365
AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT YOU

347
00:10:25,365 --> 00:10:28,234
HAVE HERE.

348
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,103
SO EITHER THEY WILL GET THEM

349
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:32,305
COMING OR GOING AND IF HE SPENT

350
00:10:32,305 --> 00:10:33,306
HIS CAMPAIGN FUNDS, THEY WOULD

351
00:10:33,306 --> 00:10:34,441
SAY YOU CAN'T SPEND CAMPAIGN

352
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:36,576
FUNDS FOR THAT, IT'S PERSONAL.

353
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:37,377
IF HE SPENDS PERSONAL FUNDS THEY

354
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:40,413
WOULD SAY, THAT HAD TO HAVE BEEN

355
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:43,383
TO BENEFIT YOUR CAMPAIGN AND

356
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:45,185
THAT'S ILLEGAL, IT CAN BENEFIT

357
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:45,485
BOTH.

358
00:10:45,485 --> 00:10:47,187

TO WHOM WAS HE SPEAKING?

SO NOT THE CONTENT, BUT THE LOG

368
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,304
OF THE CALLS.

369
00:11:04,304 --> 00:11:06,439
IS THAT SURPRISING TO YOU,

370
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:07,173
UNUSUAL TO YOU, OR WHAT WOULD

371
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:11,144
THAT INDICATE THAT MUELLER

372
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:12,745
BELIEVES?

373
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:16,983
>> IT'S ACTUALLY -- FIRST OF

374
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:19,252
ALL, REMEMBER THIS IS A SOUTHERN

375
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:22,889
DISTRICT ISSUE, NOT A MUELLER

376
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:23,189
ISSUE.

377
00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:24,524
BUT IT'S RELATIVELY STANDARD

378
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:26,025
OPERATING PROCEDURE AND YOU

379
00:11:26,025 --> 00:11:29,362
DON'T NEED PROBABLE CAUSE FOR

380
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:29,829
THAT.

381
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:32,899
YOU'VE SEEN HUNDREDS OF

382
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:33,600
THOUSANDS OF CASES THROUGHOUT

383
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,434
THE COUNTRY, AND BY THE WAY, ON

384
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:37,003
THIS NBC THING, IF NBC HAD

385
00:11:37,003 --> 00:11:40,940
TALKED TO ANYBODY WHO IS

386
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,941
KNOWLEDGEABLE ON CRIMINAL LAW

387
00:11:41,941 --> 00:11:44,143
AND WHITE-COLLAR CASES, HE WOULD

388
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:46,412
HAVE IMMEDIATELY SAID, THAT

389
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:47,714
CAN'T BE RIGHT.

390
00:11:47,714 --> 00:11:49,582
THAT STORY CAN'T BE RIGHT

391
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:50,850
BECAUSE GIULIANI IS RIGHT ABOUT

392
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,585
THAT, IT'S A CRIME TO LEAK

393
00:11:52,585 --> 00:11:53,152
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

394
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:56,990
IT'S INCREDIBLY SERIOUS, MORE

395
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,924
SERIOUS THAN LEAKING GRAND JURY

396
00:11:57,924 --> 00:11:58,324
INFORMATION.

397
00:11:58,324 --> 00:11:58,992
I KNEW THE STORY COULDN'T BE

398
00:11:58,992 --> 00:12:04,664
RIGHT WHEN I HEARD IT.

399
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:05,632
WHY DIDN'T THEY CHECK WITH

400
00:12:05,632 --> 00:12:06,299
SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY KNOW

401
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,333
SOMETHING ABOUT CRIMINAL FEDERAL

402
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,136
LAW BEFORE GOING WITH THIS?

403
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:11,037
>> Laura: THE SOUTHERN

404
00:12:11,037 --> 00:12:12,005
DISTRICT, WHAT IT FINDS HOWEVER,

405
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,506
IF IT FINDS SOMETHING AND ALL

406
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:16,142
THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT THEY TOOK

407
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:20,613
FROM MICHAEL COHEN'S VARIOUS

408
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:22,649
PLACES OF RESIDENCE, AND

409
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:26,019
ANYTHING RELATED TO RUSSIA OR

410
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,620
TEN

411
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,023
TANGENTIAL TO THE RUSSIAN

412
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:31,324
INVESTIGATION, THAT COULD BE

413
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:33,326
USED AS A PROXY TO GET

414
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:36,563
INFORMATION FOR MUELLER, RIGHT?

415
00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:39,532
>> IF YOU ARE CYNICAL, YOU COULD

416
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:42,535
USE IT AS A PROXY.

417
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:43,736
ALL THIS TIME, I'M A LITTLE

418
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:47,140
CYNICAL ABOUT THIS.

419
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,076
>> YOU ARE RIGHT.

420
00:12:50,076 --> 00:12:53,413
>> Laura: I AM A FORMER

421
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,481
DEFENSE PROSECUTOR            DF

00:12:58,017 --> 00:12:59,886
ARE A FORMER PROSECUTOR SO YOU

432
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:00,186
KNOW.

433
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:02,055
>> IF I COME ACROSS SOMETHING

434
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:02,956
THAT IS EVIDENCE OF A CRIME AND

435
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:08,127
IT'S IN MUELLER'S VALLEY WICK,

436
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,930
GOES BACK TO EVIDENCE.

437
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,701
BUT YOU LOOK AT WHAT NUMBERS YOU

438
00:13:14,701 --> 00:13:15,435
ARE DIALING, HOW MANY TIMES ARE

439
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:16,169
THEY TALKING TO THIS PERSON, BUT

440
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:17,303
THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY GETTING

441
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:20,573
THE CONTENT OF THE MESSAGE.

442
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:22,442
>> Laura: SOLD THEY SAY AFTER

443
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:23,843
HIS OFFICES WERE RAIDED, HE MADE

444
00:13:23,843 --> 00:13:25,845
A PHONE CALL TO A WHITE HOUSE

445
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:29,449
NUMBER, THEY CAN PUT THE SCREWS

446
00:13:29,449 --> 00:00:00,000
ON COHEN AND ASKED TO WHOM DID
