1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:02,446
THE PRIMARIES AND IT'S THAT

2
00:00:02,446 --> 00:00:04,915
LOYALTY TO THE PRESIDENT IS KEY.

3
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:06,784
BACK TO YOU.

4
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:07,952
>> Neil: AND IT PAID OFF.

5
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:08,753
THANKS VERY MUCH.

6
00:00:08,753 --> 00:00:10,421
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN RIGHT NOW

7
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:12,056
AND WHAT DOES IT PORTEND ABOUT

8
00:00:12,056 --> 00:00:14,525
HOW AGGRESSIVELY REPUBLICANS,

9
00:00:14,525 --> 00:00:17,595
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES USE THE

10
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:18,229
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, THE

11
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:18,629
PRESIDENT?

12
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:19,997
KARL ROVE WITH THOUGHTS ON THAT.

13
00:00:19,997 --> 00:00:22,767
WHAT DID YOU THINK, KARL?

14
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,435
>> LOOK, CALIFORNIA IS GOOD NEWS

15
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,736
FOR REPUBLICANS.

16
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:28,906
THE DEMOCRATS TARGETED SEVEN

17
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,441
REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS THAT WERE

18
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:32,442
WON BY HILLARY CLINTON AND WERE

19
00:00:32,442 --> 00:00:33,210
OCCUPIED BY REPUBLICAN.

20
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,546
A COUPLE OF THOSE RETIREMENTS.

21
00:00:35,546 --> 00:00:37,782
IN SIX OF THE SEVEN, THE

22
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:38,883
COMBINED REPUBLICAN VOTE WAS

23
00:00:38,883 --> 00:00:40,584
BIGGER THAN THE DEMOCRATIC VOTE

24
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:43,754
BY MARGINS OF FOUR POINTS TO 22

25
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:44,088
POINTS.

26
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:48,426
BECAUSE OF THE JUNGLE PRIMARY

27
00:00:48,426 --> 00:00:50,561
DRAWS MORE OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A

28
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:51,996
GENERAL ELECTORATE OUT,

29
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,731
EVERYBODY RUNS IN A BIG MESS AND

30
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,466
THE TWO TOP VOTE GETTERS GO INTO

31
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:57,134
A GENERAL ELECTION, SO THE

32
00:00:57,134 --> 00:01:00,037
TURNOUT IS HIGHER 21% IN

33
00:01:00,037 --> 00:01:02,173
CALIFORNIA VERSUS 11% IN

34
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:03,574
NEW JERSEY TURNOUT.

35
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:04,308
THE SAME NIGHT.

36
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:05,843
THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE

37
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:06,243
REPUBLICANS.

38
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:07,278
THEY HAVE LOOKED LIKE THEY GOT

39
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:08,846
IN THESE DISTRICTS THAT THE

40
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:10,381
DEMOCRATS HOPED TO WIN.

41
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:12,583
THERE'S NOT A BLUE WAVE THAT IS

42
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,451
SINKING THEM.

43
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:16,253
REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM IS AS GOOD

44
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:18,823
OR HIGHER THAN THE DEMOCRATS IN

45
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:19,990
SEVEN OF SEVEN DISTRICTS.

46
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,560
>> Neil: WHAT IS INTERESTING,

47
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,862
WE'VE GONE THE DOUBLE DIGIT

48
00:01:24,862 --> 00:01:26,464
DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN VOTERS AND

49
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:27,865
WHAT SHOULD CONTROL CONGRESS IN

50
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:29,533
FAVOR OF DEMOCRATS TO NOW WITHIN

51
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:33,037
THE MARGIN OF ERROR A FEW SINGLE

52
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:33,370
POINTS.

53
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,039
DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU -- AND I

54
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,440
KNOW THINGS CAN CHANGE IN THE

55
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,777
MONTHS AHEAD -- THAT EVEN IF THE

56
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:40,511
DEMOCRATS ARE TO GAIN SEATS IN

57
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:41,312
THE HOUSE IT WILL NOT BE NEARLY

58
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:43,581
ENOUGH TO TIP THE BALANCE OF

59
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:43,881
POWER?

60
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,416
>> WELL, IF THE ELECTION WERE

61
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:47,084
TODAY, THE DYNAMIC IS THAT I

62
00:01:47,084 --> 00:01:48,953
THINK THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE

63
00:01:48,953 --> 00:01:49,253
CASE.

64
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:51,222
THEY WOULD TAKE IT VERY NARROWLY

65
00:01:51,222 --> 00:01:53,190
BY ONE OR TWO SEATS OR LOSE IT.

66
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,426
THINK ABOUT IT.

67
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:59,463
THINK ABOUT IT, SINCE DECEMBER

68
00:01:59,463 --> 00:02:01,031
21, THE GAP WAS 13 POINTS.

69
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:01,732
NOW IT'S 3.

70
00:02:01,732 --> 00:02:03,901
THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL IN

71
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:07,605
DECEMBER WAS IN THE -- WAS 37,

72
00:02:07,605 --> 00:02:10,207
38, TODAY IT'S 43, 44.

73
00:02:10,207 --> 00:02:11,809
NOT GREAT BUT BETTER THAN IT WAS

74
00:02:11,809 --> 00:02:12,143
BEFORE.

75
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:13,511
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

76
00:02:13,511 --> 00:02:16,046
EARLIER, THE UNDERLYING VIEW OF

77
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:16,480
THE ECONOMY.

78
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,083
THE PRESIDENT EXAGGERATES IT'S

79
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,718
THE BEST ECONOMY WE'VE EVER HAD.

80
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:22,186
PEOPLE ARE FEELING GOOD ABOUT

81
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:23,654
THE ECONOMY AND THEIR OWN

82
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:24,822
PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.

83
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:26,223
SO ALL THREE OF THOSE THINGS

84
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:27,591
PLUS FOREIGN POLICY.

85
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:29,026
PEOPLE HAVE LOOKED IN THE LAST

86
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,127
COUPLE MONTHS AND REALIZED

87
00:02:30,127 --> 00:02:34,365
THINGS CAN CHANGE DRAMATICALLY.

88
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:35,466
THEY LOOK AT SYRIA, THE TOUGH

89
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:37,334
ACTION THERE, GETTING OUT OF THE

90
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:38,969
IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THE NORTH

91
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:40,704
KOREA SO FAR, IT'S BEEN RAGGED

92
00:02:40,704 --> 00:02:42,206
BUT LOOKS LIKE HE'S MAKING

93
00:02:42,206 --> 00:02:42,773
PROGRESS.

94
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:43,474
NOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

95
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:46,243
FIVE MONTHS BETWEEN NOW AND THE

96
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:50,080
ELECTION IS LIKE AN ETERNITY IN

97
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,447
POLITICS.

98
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:52,650
BUT GOING IN THE RIGHT

99
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,150
DIRECTION.

100
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,085
PRESTAGING THAT THIS IS NOT

101
00:02:55,085 --> 00:02:57,021
LIKELY TO BE A YEAR WITH A BIG

102
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:57,621
BLUE WAVE.

103
00:02:57,621 --> 00:03:02,126
IT'S LIKE TO BE THE

104
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,562
ANNIVERSARY -- THIS LOOKS LIKE

105
00:03:04,562 --> 00:03:05,896
TRENCH WARFARE.

106
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:08,032
RACE BY RACE, DISTRICT BY

107
00:03:08,032 --> 00:03:08,399
DISTRICT.

108
00:03:08,399 --> 00:00:00,000
HOW GOOD IS YOUR CANDIDATE AND
